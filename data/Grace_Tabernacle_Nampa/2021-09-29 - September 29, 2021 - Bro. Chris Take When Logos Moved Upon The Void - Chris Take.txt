basically two days friday night a service saturday five services well actually five teaching meetings you could say and then a service at night and then another service sunday morning was really good brother actually all of it was really good but five different speakers and um of course i don't believe any one of the brothers knew what each what each the other was going to speak about and it was just wonderful to see how the holy ghost just really dovetailed everything together and made the lord made a theme out of the whole thing so that in itself was really special that was very very nice and i especially loved sunday morning i just i couldn't hardly stay in my skin so anyway um that was brother jason watkins that preached that morning brother chris wasn't even there he went and preached in virginia with brother stephen coffey well that's good for him i'm sure he had a wonderful time but they fed us fed us fed us we got up had breakfast had a like a devotional went downstairs to a banquet room had our first little class had a little snack went back into the banquet room had another service another little snack or maybe it was lunch maybe and then after that another one i mean there was just boom boom boom and they would feed us in between each one so three meals a day plus and then there was a service every evening and well and um after every evening church would get over 11 and then they'd have pizza for us [Laughter] or a sandwich or something so we'd be up till 11 30 midnight and so it was a packed couple days we were there and so um the people that hosted me there in north carolina they were very very friendly and very hospitable chris clayville was his name and his wife chris's wife was keisha and that is brother daniel fryho's daughter so anyway that's who who took brother chris and i in so it was a wonderful time we really enjoyed it we sang until our throats were just raspy and so yeah so anyway we really enjoyed it thank you amen i guess if they feed you enough you're too full you can't move [Laughter] and then they can just preach they ain't going anywhere oh that's good let's go i'm glad to hear you had a wonderful time brother trevor uh i

know it was only one weekend but it feels like a lot longer when you do as much from north carolina to tennessee or virginia and back which is only a few hours but it still feels like a lot um appreciated your prayers on sunday the lord gave us a good service spoke to hearts of the people and that's what it's all about amen if you have your bibles you want to stand with me tonight had a wonderful time in the word brother trevor gave us the testimony of it um the theme he mentioned there was a theme and the theme was submitting to the authority of christ which i thought was really good i talked a lot about wives submitting to the husbands but the man must submit to the authority of christ and whatever position he's given he cannot be effective unless he submits to the authority of god hey genesis chapter one genesis chapter 1 verse 1. in the beginning god created the heaven and the earth period right verse two and the earth was without form and void and darkness was upon the face of the deep and the spirit of god moved upon the face of the waters and god said let there be light and there was light with our heads tonight gracious heavenly father we asked that you just take us one more time tonight and use us for your glory we're asking that you would speak to us lord we're all familiar with one another lord jesus is familiar with this building familiar with the process but lord may that familiarity not become too common lord may we not forget that in that familiarity lord your word is still ever changing lord ever progressing in our lives not that your word itself changes but the revelation that we have grows and expounds lord and father if we get too caught up with the familiarity of their surroundings lord our senses can become gold father may we be sharpened tonight lord father may our desire for you grow our revelation of who you are in us father grow tonight we pray for once once again remember our pastor lord out uh mountain home lord give him strength and be with them keep them safe lord just looking forward to hearing from you tonight we love you lord jesus and we commit ourselves and his words and this service into your hands in the name of jesus we pray amen you may be seated tonight praise the lord so oh you know what i never even gave alex my title that's all right then you wouldn't see it before i said it that's fine so my title tonight is when logos moved upon the void i don't know if you can turn this up down one up here down a little bit but um so when logos moved upon the void um the subtitle is and there was light so but says here in the smyrna church age down through the centuries we could go we find a moses a jeremiah a john the baptist and each one of these were god's eternal thought expressed in its season you guys are going to go to the next line well anyways there we go so he says down through the centuries we could go we find a moses a jeremiah a john the baptist and each one of these were god's eternal thought expressed in its season then we come to jesus the logos he was the perfect and complete thought expressed and he became known as the word that is what he is and forever will be amen just want to say it's good to be back like preaching to you guys not that i don't like preaching elsewhere but you're my people amen so um the logos was jesus jesus was the manifestation of the logos and we know in the if you're any kind of of a student of the word that the logos was everything that christ was all the attributes of christ everything combined in to this one thing and and uh we in the english language we have the word word um but it only goes so far in its definition and so that's why i believe brother branham pulled the greek word logos because there's so much more in the meaning of that word it's all the details and all the dna of god packed into that thing and um praise the lord it's all the word and so um in the beginning as we read here that god began to speak and brother manuel says that the logos goes out so he says here in the seed shall not be heir with the shock 1965 he was god the logos the word that went out of god remember they're one of the same okay but he says when it begin to brood upon the earth and it brought forth marine life when the spirit of god the logos the word which god said let there be and there went the logos which is the word so when god said let there be light and and god began to speak creation begin to speak the creation of the earth the logos went out now i believe god didn't have to get maybe minutely specific you didn't have to say this many oak trees or this many pine trees or pine trees here or or maple trees here or or whatever but the logos contained all of those details needed to bring forth life exactly how god had envisioned it amen and so the logos begin to brood over the earth and if you it's funny if you go look up the word brooding it means to be upset but the context here what i'm trying to say is that like a hen sitting on her eggs um so the word went out the logos went out which is the word he goes on to say and the word begin to cause all this he says the word begin to and then he says because all this was in the logos so everything was in the lord god look us the whole word of god the whole bible for every age and as the logos begin to breathe upon the earth there come marine life and building up the bird life on up to animal life and finally there comes something now watch now something in the representation or looked like the thing that was brewing it brooding over it god a man in the very image of god so as the logos is brooding over it then at his because creation built upon creation there is a progression right it's not evolution but god started with the small and worked his way all the way through so he says he worked all the way through and then comes forth a representation of the logos in other words a man in the image of god it was our first glimpse of the image of god he goes on to say he says that man fell like the seed has to fall and then god began to brood over that after the fall so the logos brood was brooding over the earth the earth was without form and void but then logos would now begin to brood over the earth and brought forth life of the earth that we see today but then god that logos it's still there today that's why in this fall this this the flowers die and they come back in the spring because the logos is still there and um um but he says but then god says and then god begin to brood over that in other words the man after the fall so he says he brought up a enoch he brought up an elijah he brought up a moses he brought up prophet after prophet trying to restore that image again even just like he moved through creation trying to bring that image again in fallen man amen and finally upon the earth came the genuine image of god himself again not the first time again which was god the logos made flesh and dwelt among us you see adam was in the image of god but adam fell so adam was the potential that christ was and and so down through god god tries through these prophets and things and finally as it were he says all right i gotta go down and do it myself it was all part of his plan right it wasn't like oh this isn't working i'm gonna step in but if you will you could say god's like all right i'm gonna go down and take care of business now is the time so christ himself goes down and he's the man manifestation of the low gods made flesh and dwelt among us now brother brown talks a lot about god turning a corner and everybody else missing it now you have to be paying attention to the word or the logos moving in the church moving in the age moving in your life to turn the corner when god turns the corner and so when when when christ came down you can say oh jesus two thousand years ago but what happened is everything that christ was god turned a corner at the day of pentecost everything that christ was he poured into the church so now the met full manifestation of the logos in the mini-member body let's continue finish the quote here now that same logos has a part he has got a bride and the same logos this word cannot be tampered with is brooding over the churches today trying to bring back the word to its full manifestation so brother i was talking about today right now wednesday um september 29th 2021 today god is brooding over the church and my brother says in other places god's pulling a bride from the church so in other words logos is brooding over the church bringing forth life from that which is the bride of christ and so he says we're trying to bring back the word to its full manifestation what's the full manifestation of the word christ in other words the bride is the full manifestation of the word or she has that potential you say this just kick the dog you see no but it's what's inside of you and we're going to get to that so the bride is a full manifestation so what uh in 1963 brother says what shall i do with jesus called christ he says when the word has been spoken for this certain generation there's going to be somebody rise on the scene that'll fulfill that word because god has spoken so why are you going to overcome because god spoke it why is there going to be a bride from the laodicean church age because god spoke it amen why do we have a revelation of god in us through us to us because god spoke it he says it's a vindication of the spoken word and jesus met every qualification and was the word vindicated as messiah exactly there's also words spoken in the bible for the last day those words have to come from the tape have to come to life in other words christ living and breathing walking on the face of the earth vindication of god's spoken word is it coming to pass just like the logos in the beginning god spoke the word in creation genesis chapter 1 the revealing of god's thought of creation on the earth was vindicated by the growing of the trees and the grass and the animals and the fish and everything every breathing thing that was the vindication of god's spoken word what god does one way he does the same all the way through it had to bring forth life the logos when god spoke over the earth the logos had to bring forth life the spoken word the seeds in the earth had they didn't have a choice they had to bring forth the life commanded from the logos and you as the bride of christ will bring forth life because the word logos is hovering over the church and you well maybe you some people i know people struggle with that but let me tell you something for that to fail is for god to fail for the word of god to not bring forth people who are prisoners of christ is for god to fail because what god did once he does the same all the way through he's jesus christ the same yesterday today and forever and we know that it is impossible for god to fail that seed that the seeds that were in the earth were always there the seed that god gave you was spoken before you even had a clue and how can you be be the eternal quality of christ unless the seed god's given you is eternal it's always there that the eternal seed of god so to make sure you know these aren't my own words the fourth seal in 1963 i was talking to a person not long ago was trying to discuss with me saying aren't you ashamed to say that god created the heavens and the earth in three days or in six days i said well that what the bible said said well we got evidence and can prove that the world is millions of years old i said that didn't have anything to do with it in genesis 1 1 it said in the beginning god created the heavens and earth period in other words there could have been a whole millions of years in between verse 1 and verse two that's all see now the world was out form and void and i said i believe every seed was laying right there from some other civilization or something and as soon as the water lifted off and the light struck it up come the trees and everything and the same thing with the human being is a type when all the mist had moved away and the revealed truth to that real seed laying there is still germatized and the light of the gospel can strike it by by true a vindication of the word it'll live it's got life in it it will it'll believe outside of that it can't live it hasn't got no life in it so the seeds on the earth were already laying there in the soil and everything needed for that seed to bring forth of what it was the life that it was to bring forth was packed into that seed all the instructions all the details everything was in that scene it just took the logos brooding over the earth and the light of the and that light to bring to begin to unfold that seed's potential now you as a child of god the seed of christ inside of you has things not yet manifested on the outside but as the logos the word of god broods over your heart over your soul it begins to unfold everything in that seed so that's why brother man says you know the rapture isn't something we have to go find it's right here with us because the rapturing faith is already in your seed it just has yet to unfold praise the lord so from the beginning when god spoke your name he had no doubts about you it always comes back it always comes back the word of god now you know you some i know growing up in the message certain words triggered my brain to turn off as a young kid logos seals my very swing [Music] but and so those those things are considered by some um to be deep and and maybe they were preached a certain way and maybe you heard them face a certain way that that um um maybe were complicated but the problem the thing with this is it always comes back to something that you're gonna take home with you uh and that is that the spoken word of god has faith that you will manifest the life of christ so in other words you wake up tomorrow and you're grumpy you don't have to worry you still have choices you got to make the right choice but you will make the right choice because christ is unfolding himself out of you you're going to change as time goes on because christ is unfolding himself out of you because he spoke it in the very beginning and the word of god christ which is the message the the the bible all of this is the logos brooding over you and he has no doubts about you he had faith in his own word now this quote here who is god i love this i don't think i've ever quite heard this i'm sure along the way up maybe but it really stuck out to me this time you can probably i mean maybe i'll glue it on my wall no my wife would kill me but um who is god 1950 where did he make it from i don't know there was nothing to make it from you know that some of you probably have already heard this but um scientists and god had a face off god said all right fine he got tired of listening to them tell him how good they were and how much they could do anything he could do so god said all right fine we'll we'll have a challenge here we'll have a face-off so um a scientist okay all right so the scientists stand there and god stands here and he's and he says so you can do anything i can do and they said absolutely and he's so he said okay so you need to do exactly what i'm going to do and you reach down and picks up a handful of dirt so they reach down to pick up a handful of dirt and god says no get your own dirt so there was nothing to make it from he says but he believed his own word and there was light god you say god has to have faith absolutely he he believed his own word and then there was light he spoke it in other words the logos went out and he had faith in that logos and his faith in that logos brought light now if you are his word manifested raise your hand if you believe that i'm good we're mostly there if you are his word manifested and he has faith in his word then he has faith in you even on your worst day remember god christ has faith in you when you're upset or you've fallen god has faith in you he had faith in gideon or he would have never ever called him see we can look at the story of gideon and um because it's history now and we can see and if we're not careful we could say oh yeah that's it's easy if you're gideon but gideon didn't have any faith it appeared he was hiding from the midianites and but see god called him god said gideon that mighty mount of valor what was god seeing god was seeing the seed inside gideon see gideon was not yet manifesting the attribute of valor can we be honest tonight gideon at that point in time was not manifesting the attribute of valor or bravery or fierceness or confidence none of that but it was there waiting on something and when the when the angel came down to gabriel what is the first thing he does he speaks the word to gideon gideon thy mighty man of valor christ came and he spoke to you sister carrie my bride for the trevor my son my bride god begin to speak the word see don't worry about what you see on the outside just speak the word because it's that spoken word that logos see nothing happened while the earth was without form and void nothing happened it sat there without form and void from all all outward appearances if you were walking through the galaxy and you saw earth you would say oh that thing has nothing there's nothing to that there's no uh there's no life on that but the seeds were already down inside the earth and when god god knew the earth was there see nothing happened till god spoke the word then the logos went out and began to brood over that and it brought what forth we see what we see today but if you look at the outside you say there's no potential for what is life victory you say there's no potential for victory in that you look at somebody and say there's no potential for victory in them so you can't do that because you don't know the sheet that's inside of them or you look at a situation in your life or you need a job or you need a job change or you need a new boss or you you you need a boss you begin to you can look at that situation and say there there's there's no life in there there's no victory in there but you don't know what god has waiting down inside of there and he just wants you to step forward in faith in confidence and have faith in your word based on the word so you have a word but you base your word upon the word then you can have faith in that word and god will back that faith up this is nothing new brother brother said speak that perfect healed body into existence and step into it that's what he said it's your faith okay so so he had faith in gideon amen that scripture while we were yet sinners christ died for us and we can't hardly help some weird looking person out on the street yet that person christ died for them in that state faith in his spoken word christ had faith in his spoken word so when he died for us well we were still sinners he had faith that you would eventually manifest his spoken word it is the rising of the and his his death on the cross was a testament to his faith in his word when you die and fully surrender to christ god recognizes your faith in his word and brings your deliverance brings your victory 1965 it is the rising of the sun but the verb says now the sun at the rising of the sun well there was a time when the world was laying in utter darkness it was without form and was void and it was all covered with water and was laying there in the dark dismal gloomy atmosphere and the spirit of god moved upon that water and said let there be light god had a reason to do that for down beneath that water there was seeds that he had planted and it had to have that sunlight to make it live and the first light was ever given in the earth was god's spoken word so the first light were god's word logos that was the first light the first light that ever struck the earth was god's spoken word he said let there be light and there was light that turned darkness into light it didn't push the darkness away it was a new creation turned the darkness into light and uh in order to bring forth a creation of joy and life upon the earth then the spirit of god as it moved with love and compassion i like them that stands out to me because i i am i am disappointed and uh in some of our brothers and sisters who will stand and look at somebody and and who who's who's not serving god and they'll they'll begin to to say things like you know i i hope their life is miserable and they see that they need god that's only done if it's done in the right attitude the right spirit you don't because if you're not careful you will speak those words about somebody in bitterness because you're upset they don't serve god anymore because you're upset that they're going against what you believe so you take it personal and you begin to say these things out of bitterness and frustration what you're doing is because you have creative power in your words you're now pushing back against potentially pushing back against what god's trying to do but you see compassion now love the love of christ compassion for the verb says with christ braiding the whip and beating those money changers out of the temple so don't misconstrue compassion either there is a time and a place but what you want to do is you want to show forth and you want to speak forth to them if you have the opportunity a lot of us have now the day that we live in family members who aren't serving god or who were serving the living going to church in the message and uh we let's get the chance to speak to them we want to portray christ because it's christ that's going to bring them back you taking newspaper clippings and history books and trying to prove them you're doing exactly what somebody else did to them that convinced them otherwise so you're not going to have any success but if they see christ in you in love and compassion there's no compassion you don't stand for anything contrary to the word of god amen they i believe that that god can use that but if you get the wrong attitude god um it's just you're the one who's going to be flat on your back um praise the lord been there done that at that great day he says the first day of the dawn of creation upon the earth the sun rose and swept across its rays and brought up the waters from the earth and made an atmosphere above and for its first time it was to bring joy and life to the earth by a seed that was a great hour amen the world so the world was made by faith and creation or or it was a miracle because it made things which are now out of things which were not praise the lord now uh i have quite a few quotes in here i might skip over one here i'm just going to highlight it uh in church age book chapter 8 philadelphia church age i'm gonna bring out my highlights in here it was as when egypt was so dark that one could feel it are we there today the darkness is pretty thick but now true light has come but now the fulfillment of the light has come and what was but glowing word has now broken forth in the brightness of god manifested among his people as the pillar of fire gave light at night and that was wonderful now light and life were manifested in the fullness of the godhead bodily praise the lord so now um praise the lord second kings chapter five i'm gonna skip a few things here and feeling led to just leave that alone um second kings chapter five if you wanna turn there we're gonna take this story here it's a very familiar story and as i've said many times over the pulpit here you uh have it in your in your mind you remember stories in the bible but it's good to go back and re-read them and so i was feeling i was thinking about the story of naaman the other day and um i decided to go back in and read it again and and you read it with different uh seasons in your life different experiences you've gone to gone through up to this point and and you begin to see things and i believe also god brings things from this his word because it is eternal and um so a few things just kind of spoke to my heart and i believe they fit very perfectly in what we're talking about tonight so i think in king chapter 5 you can read it now or you can read it later 1-19 now naaman captain of the host of the king of syria was a great man with his master and honorable because by him the lord had given deliverance unto syria he was also a maddie man of valor stop don't read the rest he's a great man he's honorable the lord used him to bring deliverance he was a mighty man of valor there was one caveat he was a leper and the syrians had gone out by companies and had brought away a captive out of the land of israel a little maid and she waited on naaman's wife see you can be many many great things but without christ you were a leper and she said unto her mistress would god my lord were with the prophet that is in samaria for he would recover him of leprosy see two verses there this little maid gets and i i've talked about this with the youth but what how many years of heartache did she go through to bring her to that position see god has a position for all of us and how we get to that position it depends entirely upon his will for our life she probably lost her family she was taken captive who knows where her family is maybe separated from them maybe she's gone through a lot but now she's here and she's in position and she's submitting to the authority of christ and allowing the logos to speak through her and says hey there's a prophet in samaria and see we we don't know we one conversation one one phrase to somebody could be a seat planted that we will never see the fruition of that on this side but let us not be caught up in what we can see from our own works but not worry about it and every chance we get speak the word of god and one went in and told his lord saying thus and thus said the maid that is of the land of israel and the king of syria said go to go i will send a letter unto the king of israel he departed and took with him ten talents of silver and six thousand pieces of gold and ten changes of raiment and he brought the letter to the king of israel saying now when this letter has come unto thee behold i have therewith sin name and my servant to thee that thou mayest recover him of his leprosy and it came to pass when the king of israel had read the letter that he rent his clothes and said am i god to kill and to make a lie that this man hath sent unto me to recover a man of his leprosy wherefore consider i pray you and see how he seeketh a quarrel against me there is a message and a word in this king's kingdom that can bring the solution to this problem and immediately there's no hope and it's elisha who sends to the king and says send him my way verse 8 and it was so when elisha the man of god had heard that the king of israel had rented his clothes that he sent to the king saying wherefore has thyroid thy clothes why are you distressed i was praying in the office before coming tonight you know the lord is such a good a good father he takes care of his of his people he's such a good husband to his bride so why do we worry what what do we rent our clothes and and and and be dramatic about what we're experiencing you know you know we were acting like we broke our arm and we just stubbed our toe i'm still in the debate of which one's actually worse he says let him come now to me and he shall know that there is a prophet in israel in other words he shall know the word of god so naaman came with his horses and with his chariots and stood at the door of the house of elisha and elisa elisha sent a messenger unto him now we're watching the word of god naaman was without form and void he had all these potentials but he he was missing one thing and and that was that he was a leper he was a sinner leprosy is a type of sin he had sin he was not yet complete he was without form and void but he had the potential to be exactly what god wanted him to be but god had to get him to the place where his word could be spoken over naaman spoken to naaman so we all have a different path to get to that point where the word of god is spoken but god pre-ordained have foreign that time in that place so now here we're looking at naaman coming to this position and this really brings this this thought down to where the rubber meets the road and that is that we all have things that that that um i should say i should say this we all come to our deliverance to our victory to our healing when we overcome things that conflict with the word of god in our life so naaman had a problem he said yeah it was leprosy god could see deeper into the heart of naaman the cause for name and sin neymar's leprosy was his pride naaman comes to the king in all his glory and then he says go to the prophet and oh another another prestigious man well known in israel takes his chariots and his men and goes to the prophet and the prophet sends a messenger not much glory in that it's the messenger washington jordan river seven times and thy flesh shall come again to thee and thou shalt be clean but naaman was wrath he was upset are you kidding me he's like i i i thought i would come to the prophet he would come out to me he would stand and call in the name of the lord and strike his hand over the place and recover the leper in other words his expectation for his deliverance didn't line up with the word of god so he went away angry and i've said this before too we pray for god to give us bread it gives us a kitchen and all the ingredients and we storm out of the kitchen that's actually another sermon on the logos i might have this this three-part thing going here i'm not really sure but the logos expectations god had expectations but naaman's expectations didn't line up with those so until naaman's expectations lined up with them there was no victory over name and sin so he says are not the abana and farpa rivers of damascus better than all the waters of israel may are not washing them and be clean so he turned and went away in a rage not just mad or upset a rage red in the face kicking the chariot wheels smacking the horses harder than you should a rage see he kind of had partial truth there didn't matter the river any of those rivers would have worked but you see the lord knew naaman thought that jordan river was plain nasty it would be no big thing for naaman to take a bath in habana or pharpa easy it's no big thing for people to walk into a church that is just state of the art fancy a preacher is composed never takes his suit coat off never leaves the pulpit service is about 15 minutes all the all the music and everything is just perfect the sound is perfect the glass cathedrals right i don't know where i was going with that anyways right it's easy to go to a place like that you feel comfortable there's lots of people but when you go when god calls you to go somewhere and it's old and shabby the people are a little bit touched still god's people just different than what you would consider normal um it's not always easy or god asks you to do something you know you wanna you wanna you wanna buy that nice old lady her latte in line at starbucks but maybe he wants you to help that man who fell on the sidewalk who's covered in his own waist stand back on his feet right it's different sometimes serving god is very messy see so but god was trying to get to naaman and naaman's the um the key to to his to naaman's deliverance the key was humility it could have been another river there was nothing special about the river jordan nothing special about the water you're baptized in it's your action upon the god upon god's word that has the power behind it and his servants came near and spake unto him and said my father if the prophet had been they do some great thing would thou not have done it how much rather than when he saith to thee wash and be clean god hiding himself in simplicity the word of god is simple but that doesn't mean it's easy to apply all the time and his servants came so his the the word of god went forth naaman received the word but it was through his servants who took the word given through their perspective with the anointing of the holy spirit that turned naaman to follow the word of god his servants five-fold ministry and it wasn't it wasn't what the prophet said that cured naaman i said well brother chris is just blasphemed this is what killed naaman then he went he down and dipped himself seven times in jordan according to the saying of the man of god and his flesh came again like under the flesh of a little child and he was clean his obedience to the word given is what cured him you can sit and hear read the bible you can sit and hear a tape all day long but if that word is never applied in your life you will not find the cure his action based on the word given see faith gave him the courage to act it's faith in god's word that gave him the courage to act so his humility was the key and his obedience to the word of god was the cure so now naaman is risen from the ashes his life had been without form and void good but not all the way not whole amen but the logos hovered over him and it was the light of god the light of christ that brought his deliverance psalms 20 verse and i'm closing here and they are brought down and fallen but we are risen and stand upright psalms 20 verse 8. see maybe there's something that that that that was in it that was in your life is in your life and god's calling you to make and to to to step forward in faith to to act upon his word given but because he asked you to wash in the river jordan because he asked you to do something that is humbling sometimes we can struggle with that that is hard to swallow but this scripture here gives us a promise psalms 20 verse 8 they are brought down and fallen if you go and read the chapter the enemy the the the the devil the opposition is brought down and fallen but we are risen and stand upright when the low gospel was brooding over the earth amen victory came life came from that and life rose from the earth just like when god moves in your life amen you will rise up and stand upright stand on your own two feet but also upright and righteousness all righteousness is but filthy rags but with god and when we stand clean and forgiven we stand clothed in his righteousness amen we can we can go and read the story in ezekiel but about the dry bones you see god gives ezekiel a vision of these of these dry bones and he asks him he says ezekiel can these dry bones live again you can't have dry bones unless you first had life you dry bones come from what was life and so he says can these dry bones live again ezekiel says you only you know lord and the lord says speak to them and so the what is ezekiel he speaks in other words in other words god the logos anoints ezekiel to speak the word to the dry bones it's the same thing as the earth so speak the word to the dry bones of your life the dry blooms of your relationship the dry bones of your relationship with christ with your with with your family member or your husband or your kid speak god's word i like ezekiel god has already given you the vision you just have to be willing to speak the word and if you want to speak the word you have to have the word to speak and that is not that you stand up and you just start preaching to that person your life speaks volumes how you live your life so if you are harnessed to the word of god and the logos is moving upon your life your life as you live it is going to speak christ it's going to bring forth that spoken word we don't know what happened to those dry bones or what brought them into this lifeless state but the potential for them to live was still there and the word of god spoke amen and they came forth praise the lord that musicians want to come tonight amen naaman had to lay down and surrender colossians 3 3 for ye are dead and your life is hid with christ in god so you are now dead in christ when you surrender to the lord to the dealing that he's doing in your life you become dead in christ now you're in a position like the dry bones like the earth you're in a position to receive life amen through the logos or the full manifestation of the word hovering over your void and it's christ's spoken word see it doesn't end there maybe you have dry bones maybe there is darkness and void but it doesn't end there because the word of god speaks and what was my subtitle and there was light never ever are you left without hope never and god's word always goes out excuse me god's word goes out and never returns void so if he spoke you to this age and called you to be here you will come you will go and return to him because you're his spoken word i i know all of you very well for a small church and sometimes when god lays things like this on my heart i i don't know i think that i think that this will not apply to anybody because we're perfect just kidding i don't think you've heard me i love you but so [Music] i i don't know if if god spoke to your heart excuse me god spoke to your heart you had to have faith that what god laid on my heart is for all of you one of you and and i was talking to my wife a message because i i have to i'll i'll break the bad news to you i preach this on sundays welcome to the second version it's always different because god's word is spoken and we we stand up here and we preach read the same scriptures read the same quotes but you and your experiences and your season hear exactly what you need to hear i can have i can have sometimes you will you know you'll share something with me or afterwards and it'll be [Music] technically three different sermons but it all came from the same one and so i don't know the deepest darkest secrets of your life don't want to know them um if god spoke to your heart tonight and i believe he has and he's calling you to action don't confuse that with with just me you see me all the time you know me you know my weaknesses you've seen me get frustrated unfortunately um but don't sit and just say oh you know chris spoke tonight we had church god every service whether it's it's me speaking or brother or pastor speaking or brother david speaking god is calling you to action and to step it to to to take faith and to put god's word to action it can be written of you in the scriptures just like nathan you washed in the river if you received the holy ghost you washed in the river jordan right that's it that's the ultimate type of river jordan so i trust that that that tonight if i if i said something that was direct look i don't know but god knows i think i know you but there's parts to all of us that only god knows so what i'm saying what i'm trying to say tonight is is take the word take it serious take it serious god has spoken to to i hope god has spoken to your heart and trust he has he's spoken to my heart and we have been called to let's not stand on the sidelines and let somebody else do all the work let's get in there amen praise the lord let's bow our heads tonight heavenly father we're so thankful that you came tonight father your word is eternal [Music] your word is everything we need the victories the battles that we're going to face in our life if you should tarry lord we already have the victories for those battles down inside of us but father you call us to lay underneath the spirit of christ the word of god for those attributes to unfold from within us we love you lord jesus we thank you for all that you've done we just commit ourselves into your hands tonight lord desiring father that you would just continue to draw us closer to you
