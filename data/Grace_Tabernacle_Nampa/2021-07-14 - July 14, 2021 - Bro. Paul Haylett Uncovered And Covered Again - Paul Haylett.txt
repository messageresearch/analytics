be with them away my sheep know my voice [Music] and they go not astray they love me because i have me and my joy and they fall oh my god for my sheep [Music] are you happy tonight to be identified as one of god's sheep amen nothing more precious than that amen you know i've often said and certainly it's not my thought alone but we live in a day that has a tremendous identity crisis and uh people are are being identified or identifying themselves in very interesting fashions and um you know in the in this world that we live today we we look at this and it seems like and i want you to catch this don't don't make a quick assumption it seems like the world is just going absolutely crazy you notice i said seems like but do you realize they're actually just fulfilling the word of god so it's not really about their insanity it's about a prophetic word that has come and said this is what the world's going to look like this is what my bride is going to look like and as we go into this scripture this evening you're going to i hope catch upon a couple of these scriptures here that very much uh just breaks it right down so that we can see why the world views you like you do like they do and why you view the world like you do amen to to see that so god bless you brother vasily good to see you home amen uh just um always good to be back amongst amongst the saints amongst the people i want to speak to you this evening on uncovered and covered again and um we'll just uh go to the word thank you uh musicians uh brother jason uh amen just uh felt nervous but the singing of the songs just touched my heart and just feel calm amen and so let's just stand as we go into john the 15th chapter and we'll look at this and just touch upon these words here starting john 15 and 14. and now remember if you have a red letter bible this is red letter amen this is our lord jesus christ speaking to you and i so these are not even now i don't don't misunderstand me i'm not saying that paul and the rest ever put anything to it right they come they brought what was laid upon their hearts as the holy ghost spoke to them but we have and i want you to catch this in in just my thought i i don't want to say that i'm putting any less on any of the apostles but this would be as though the prophet of god says this would be as though god was speaking to you lip to ear right when jesus speaks we can take that literally as though he was sitting in the chair with us he was in the car with us uh and and it's lip to ear amen and i meant to say brother david i meant to call you a couple times in the last couple days and every time i went to call you it seemed like the wheels fell off the wagon and i spent time jacking the car up and putting the wheels back on and um so uh anyway i just pray lord bless you with the saints here so we look at this now verse 14 ye are my friends if you do whatsoever i command you now that seems as though there's a caveat placed upon the friendship right but let's take this now because our lord jesus christ was not as it were a fair weather friend but what he was actually taking and defining by the word of god was actually not his definition of our friendship he's actually describing our definition to him we say we believe we say he is lord we say he is healer and deliverer and provider we say but if we don't do the word then all of this really becomes nolan void because we can say he's lord and master we can say he's friend but we have to project this ourself did that make sense to you henceforth i call you not servants he's placing an incredible value now saints i actually touched on these scriptures here if your memory catches that we we touched on john 15 here recently so i i hope that we can tie this together henceforth i call you not servants for the servant knoweth not what his lord doeth but i have called you friends for all things that i have heard of my father i have made known unto you now off of this verse right here saints we can say the word of god is now an open book you have not chosen me but i have chosen you and ordained you that you should go and bring forth fruit and that your fruit should remain that whatsoever you shall ask of the father in my name he may give it you these things i command you that you love one another isn't that interesting it didn't start with anything else on the list now i don't mean to keep you standing but you see if we can't come to the place that we love one another then it don't matter what revelations we talk about and god spoke to me about this and spoke to me about that he's placing the starting point in believing on him obeying his commandments and loving one another i love that very simplistic but difficult maybe if the world hates you you know that it hated me before it hated you and i don't know why i find a little something inside of me it's like a lot easier when you stand in company knowing people dislike not just you because of maybe your personality your looks your whatever and but but to realize that there is a body there there's a reason it hated me before it hated you now verse 19 if ye were of the world the world would love his own but because ye are not of the world but i have chosen you out of the world therefore the world hated you when they would snicker at a sister when they would say oh my we can't tell our jokes in the cafeteria because he is here you see it's not about us remember the word that i said unto you the servant is not greater than his lord and if they have persecuted me they will also persecute you if they have kept my s if they have kept my saying they will keep yours also but all these things will they do unto you for my name's sake because they know not him that sent me now let me just put this in here the one who knows him is the one who carries his name that's the only way you can say that a wife or a husband would then know this their spouse is they carry the name remember brother branham says there's only one mrs william branham and she's the one who goes home with me if i had not come and spoken unto them and they had not had sin but now they have no cloak for their sin he that hateth me hateth my father also and if i had not done among them the works which none other man did they had not sin not had had sin but now they have seen and hated both me and my father but this cometh to pass that the word might be fulfilled that is written in their law they hated me without cause but when the comforter is calm he's come saints whom i will send unto you from the father even the spirit of truth which proceedeth from the father he shall testify of me and ye also shall bear witness because ye have been with me from the beginning now this goes much deeper my brother and sister our lord jesus is speaking here he's not talking about the beginning of his ministry he's talking about from the beginning oh isn't that beautiful heavenly father lord we love you tonight just ask your father to help us lord just lead us to guide us to speak the right words tonight and lord just be amongst your saints father those who are not present tonight lord we would just ask you father to be with them whatever the circumstance lord be with those that are out of the state out of the country father whatever the circumstance might be lord of the body of christ the body of believers be with them lord we love you and adore you ask you to come on the scene lord as you look at the hearts of the saints father i ask you come on this scene father for their hearts desires tonight in the name of jesus christ we pray amen you may be seated amen now as we look at this my brother and sister i really really really uh just you know i don't know it just strikes me as you read the scriptures and you come across certain things and you cross reference and you go back which is what brought me to these scriptures again was kind of a cross-reference just coming back and just a reminder you have not chosen me but i have chosen you and ordained you you see it's not my brother and sister about something how that we come to a certain place and god said wow they excel i i think you know that they're going to be the olympians of the message it's it's not about that it's him looking down through time and saying you know what the very life the very seed the very nature everything about them is me and i've placed myself in them and i'm not concerned about what will happen in the ages to come i'm not concerned what that will be the mandates of the world that they will live in because they're mine and while he has then my brother and sister not just a mortgage on you he doesn't have just a promissory note on you he has the title deed amen and that takes us and we'll make a little reference to this a little later but my brother and sister when we see boaz and we see the whole story right there when boaz come he didn't just say now i i'm going to you know just try and claim the pretty girl here called ruth but i am claiming all that naomi lost now my brother and sister what name we lost was actually the family heritage it was everything that was ever associated with her family that would have come down so this was not just some little minor event that was taking place and i think sometimes we're just like yeah yep he went to the city center he was there at the gates and and he said now you're going to claim you got to just you know do this no this was a very significant action that was taking place and in that element right there we see that uh the very type of christ which as we study the scripture we see that and how he's made the claim my brother and sister not just to claim one little portion of it but to claim it all and it's quite interesting because in our good days and our good deeds and our abilities we could see maybe some merit to be claimed but in our days that are struggled and full of uh uh trouble and toil and and uh you know satan's whispered in our ear and and we just kind of feel you know that we just aren't worthy and you know what i'm talking about and and he he claimed you on that day also amen he knew that day would come and he claimed you on that day also and you know so the highs are easy to live and be excited the lows my brother and sister can sometimes be low enough that we think well why would god even claim me but i want you to know when he says you have not chosen me but i have chosen you on the days that you're worthy no no no no he simply said i choose you i have chosen past tense chosen you so it's there that we look in the world we get and my brother and sister just studying the message and and and listening and whatnot you know we say well it it's just we live in a difficult time well you know i have no clue and i don't believe anyone else really has a clue but my brother and sister the times are very well will be more difficult but don't worry about it because the standard is still being raised up it didn't just reach a certain height and stop there but the standard is continuing to rise at our need oh hallelujah that makes me so happy to realize that i i don't have to you know hope that god will come on the scene or hope that the lord will meet me there but he says right here you know that if i would ask anything in his name the father will give it to me and my brother and sister i i think we ought to just step out in confidence upon that and just stand and say you know what i believe this is what i need brother rich up at the camp you know spoke on that if you need a different car and you're not just doing it for for some kind of vanity reason you need something to come on the scene you need to do that we have a provider amen it's not here just because we want big 20-inch spinner wheels or you know something better than everyone in the church that won't qualify but to have a need in our life we need to have the confidence to stand up and make that claim amen because my brother and sister we carry his name we're not here just in ourselves to say we're christians we we are sons and daughters of god we are mrs jesus christ but we need to actually recognize that that is the reality that is the truth of it we carry his name hallelujah well he says that he carries our name in the palms of his hands right we were in him from before the foundation of the world now look at this my brother and sister in verse 22 uh maybe i'm getting ahead of myself but my brother and sister you see as we look at this jesus is speaking these verses here jesus is speaking to the people and i just put a little uh parentheses here it's us because as he's speaking to the believer he's speaking to those that he says you know what i i have chosen you i've claimed you so he's speaking to us and you know when a son or daughter of god reading the word of god he reads that and something in you resignates my brother and sister these are god's words of affirmation to you these are god's words of encouraging you telling you get up quit crying you can do it now if you don't feel that way i did so anyway i'll just cover that base get up and just quit crying and just do the work just for walking amen the promised land is right there and it is a promise it's not the land of hope it's not the land of maybe an opportunity my brother and sister yes there was blessings that were promised to be in the land but it was a land of promise it was a land of prophecy and we have a land of promise and we have a land of prophecy that we should claim and dwell in it not just look off and say well maybe someday or under some thing you see i just love that amen maybe brother chris will i'll lead the church in that little song i can't even remember the words but you know i i was like a little hesitant at first you know because i i do you know try to be dignified but you know it's about time we just stand up i've got it on video i've got you guys on video you realize that and we're stepping out right and we're claiming what the devil has stole from us amen not just one time we're going to keep right on doing it each and every day we're just going to walk and and we're going to go back out and we're going to claim what the devil stole from us and so sometimes we need some words of affirmation just to to keep remembering that what he has in his hand talking about the devil is actually ours amen it's time for us to take it back from it so we're not stealing it from him amen it's already ours amen now you see these words of affirmation do you know the bible is what is referred to sometimes as a multi-speak multi-speak now that terminology is used when a term applies to different people in different ways so something is spoke the bible's full of it you know that the bible's full the very words that are redemption to you are judgment to them the very words that are loved to you and a revelation to you are un that they don't understand them they can't find uh the the right you know determination of what this really means but and now don't make emphasis on the word multi-speak i'm just use that word that's something i read here recently but you see when god speaks to you through the word amen that's not what they're hearing out here that's not what those people carousing the streets of the city tonight are hearing they're not hearing the same thing you hear when you read the word or hear the word of god so the word is speaking to the brine much the same way as brother branham talks about going overseas and uh uh you know receiving a letter from his wife and she's talking about she got the kids to bed and she did some laundry and she's doing some ironing and or whatever i see brother branham and then saying you know what uh what it is is is i understand her language i understand what she is saying she's saying you know what i wish you were here i miss you i love you i care for you and and someone else would say well that seems interesting that she would write about that a letter that's traveled all the way across the ocean to come into his hands and she doesn't declare these things but she is and the word of god my brother and sister is declaring god's love affirmation to you and i tonight and the world looks at this and says yes john 3 16 we love it but my brother and sister john 3 16 means something different to you and i than it does to the world out here for god so loved the world that he gave his only begotten son to draw you and i out of the world amen it's not just a matter of spreading his love over the earth but his love went out and drew you and i from this very world that we live in amen so the believer understands the words of our lord jesus christ tied right to it you see sometimes it's kind of a blunt speech to the unrevelated some people don't like it they they kind of push back on it that isn't what the prophet said that isn't what he meant the reason is my brother and sister is that word is not speaking to them the same way is speaking to you oh some people might say oh oh you got some other revelation you got something you know quite honestly i do quite honestly you do because you now understand god's language the language of our lord jesus christ you understand it when you read the word you know what he's saying to you and it resonates down in your heart and soul hallelujah now let's just go back to verse 22 for just a moment now as i made this statement the one who knows him truly knows him as the one that carries his name and that's not just a man or a woman saying oh i i'm a son or daughter of god i'm the bride of christ anybody can say that my brother and sister you know anybody can say well i really believe the word the devil believes the word he knows it's true but that doesn't make him say amen to it you will never find the devil saying amen or so be it to the revealed word of god versions of it interpretations of it presentations of it he can say amen to but not the true revelated word of god now what is it my brother and sister i hope i'm making my point to you what is it then that comes and something happens to you and i good days are bad days something inside of us says amen to that word amen we can't help ourself even if it's skin in us we just say amen amen lord that's the truth now verse 22 he says if i had not come and spoken unto them they had not had sin you see in the ignorance absolute lack of knowledge of they were just proceeding forward with nothing to judge them nothing to show them anything different you see our lord jesus christ come right down and stood in the midst sadducees pharisees sanhedrin counsel all of these people of the day and he spoke the word and literally judgment fell now let's think about it my brother and sister because it seems like sometimes the hardest days you have are right after communion the devil wants to come and try to just kind of shove that back at you your communion with god well i'll tell you what i'll trip you i'll make you eat dirt i'll let you crawl in whatever and and you know you look at this now my brother and sister to see that at the time in the place that that satan would come he he doesn't like the fact that the word brings us into a judgment but look what even as we have the scriptures for communion and it's declaring to us examine yourself what's god doing god is uncovering you god is uncovering you saints and look what happened right here you see it's the very word that uncovered us in the beginning and let us know we weren't of this world and our behavior and our actions and the things that we thought on and were identified in and he uncovered us and he says here now you know if i had not come and spoken them they had had not sin but now they have no cloak for their sin they have no covering amen no outer garment no cloth no covering oh who can say thank you lord thank you lord i i love it my brother and sister and sometimes it's it can be a bitter pill when you realize there's some little something in your life that you didn't think was a problem before but suddenly now it it appears to you to be a problem and you're like oh lord help me i went for years this way or in this and and and god comes but what's he doing my brother and sister he's uncovering he's uncovering and it's not oh i hope you catch this tonight it's not whether it's uncovered in our life or not people are like oh no i don't want no one to know i don't want this to be exposed no we do want it to be exposed it's not that it was there and it is uncovered it's what we do with it after it's uncovered that's what god's working on he's oh i'll tell you what my brother and sister there's no surprises to god god doesn't say oh my goodness oh look what they've done or look what they thought or look what they said no it's after it's uncovered you see to them it became sin at the moment he uncovered it but they chose this goes much deeper as you well know i mean there's much more explanation but praise the lord i'm just trying to keep a normal time frame tonight you see all that was exposed right there none of that condemned them you realize that not one drop of it condemned them until re they rejected the solution until they reject the choice and then it became sin to them imagine in a perfect world they would have all said oh oh my what have we done forgive us lord what a different world it would have been amen but you see the spirit of that day and the spirit of today are much the same they use god when he's convenient we have a tragedy we need god when we're doing well we want to do it my way amen so he says you know now they have no cloak they have no garment they have no covering for this sin and so as they stand there now my brother and sister exposed as it were they they have no way to hide this it has now been brought forth and put into the open and obviously if a man had a lot of pride and and position and uh you know something that he was holding to uh that would make you unhappy right to have your unbelief have your position you know exposed to the people but you see my brother and sister it really wasn't that big of deal in the public uh window or public display because these people that jesus spoke to were actually surrounded by people of the same spirit so no made a great big deal about this because they were in present company they were in uh you know birds of a feather they were in the same position and and so each one remember you want a little confirmation of that the woman caught in the very act of adultery and as jesus speaks to them he doesn't say now okay i'm gonna pick which one of you that is the highest authority to judge her he says i'm going to pick the one who has no sin see what did he do he lifted the cloak off of the very fact that my brother and sister and i i know you catch this so i don't want to be too redundant but the very fact he pulled the cloak off of this and there wasn't one who stood forth and said you know according to the word we should stone her and i'm obligated i'm obligated to do this not one i would love to know wouldn't the whole world love to know just exactly what it was jesus was writing in the sand i don't know you know different times different places i've heard people present it just trying to make the same idea not a doctrine but maybe they're writing dates maybe they were writing names maybe they were writing locations figuratively maybe they were writing bank account numbers whatever it was it caught their attention and they said i am out of here not one repented not one repented there was an open door what had happened in their life was now exposed uncovered and they could have said oh forgive me lord but they chose to pull their own covering back over their own life god help us forgive me lord forgive us lord hallelujah amen you know this can be pretty blunt speech to the unrelated but to a real believer to a son or daughter of god they're going to say you know what lord i recognize this that when you uncover these things in my life it's for me to then repent and to take these things and move forward and come to a higher plane amen god never trying to cut us down my brother and sister the way up is down the way down is up but god is constantly in fact i would put it this way that when we think god is taking us down he's actually lifting up amen and there is the beauty of it so we got to switch our our thinking amen kind of a spiritual dyslexia in a sense that you know we look at it backwards but we got to see it the way god wrote it amen and now any of you that have ever experienced dyslexia you understand what it's like that you look at something and and you are just convinced that it's a certain way but in fact we have it backwards but there's different how would you say it depths of dyslexia there are some that not every word is reversed very very confusing for a young child because then he can't trust himself of which word is forward and which word is reversed but oh i hope you catch this by training by training they learn and then they go on i had a friend i haven't seen him for quite a few years he had dyslexia very embarrassing for him when he was a young man sixth seventh eighth ninth grade very embarrassing a lot of people made fun of him but you know his family loved him a lot cared about him and they worked and over time he had to how would you say process it when he was reading so he didn't read real fast he wasn't some speed reader and he processed it and he read but what was really cool about that if i can just throw this out to he understood what he read it wasn't just words on a page it wasn't just something he could repeat went on to accomplish great things i think he became an engineer architect something of that nature went to college my brother and sister the kids who made fun of him most of them never reach such height so you look at this now what has happened so our lord jesus christ is telling them because i told you the word because i shared the word with you i have now taken the outer garment that covered you what you thought was your covering what you thought was your protection what you thought was good enough i have now taken that from you and caused you to have to dig deeper and look deeper at your own self oh my brother and sister if you understand the day that they lived in people might go and they've walked in the dusty roads and they would do and maybe they were going somewhere and maybe it was somewhere of importance you know they didn't just have a shower like us right then just slip into somewhere rent a room get showered up so what they would do is have a clean cloak a clean outer garment that they would put on and with the washing of their hands and their feet then they were presentable but my brother and sister they were still dirty underneath oh isn't that the very nature of humanity we just want to put something over the top and look good but god wants us to get right down and see what is the very depths of what we are and what we are covering up and and he says look i'm not going to shame you i'm not going to condem i'm not going to do these things i just want you to know i want you to see and in the talks in the talking of salvation i want you just to repent i don't want you to go find another garment to put on amen have any of you ever seen the little video on youtube about the it's kind of a put on thing or whatever about you know uh people i think they blame it on the millennials but uh we won't judge the millennials but you know it's like well they're interviewing the church this young couple now oh okay now what time are your services well we have a nine o'clock and we have 11 o'clock they're like you don't have a two o'clock because nine o'clock and eleven o'clock are just too early for us and let us see the nursery i want to i want to see if you you don't have a bounce house our our son likes bounce houses ultimately the ministry of shine communism this is a wonderful place to come you'll like it and they're looking at each other you see my brother and sister the cloak that they had on was not a cloak of serving god it was a cloak of serving themselves under the umbrella of god and so it really was all about what they wanted and there is without god coming and dealing with them no way that mere man's words will penetrate that outer garment please me you see when jesus spoke the sin was uncovered not by a man preaching to them but it was uncovered by the word now we by revelation know the word was made flesh and so that was god himself standing there speaking to them but my brother and sister i'll just put it this way brother david brother chris speaking the word have the same exact effect of the word of god upon an individual because speaking the word my brother and sister is the word amen that is our lord jesus christ so the sin is uncovered by the preaching or speaking of the word and the word will uncovered you realize that the true anointed word of god will never just pass over amen it passed over my brother and sister in egypt because the blood had been applied otherwise the word will not pass over it will not just leave that because word is a corrector amen but the word also makes my heart glad as a restorer amen when it corrects us it then puts us right back where we should be in the fashion we should be but look at this and this is one thing i really love and and way too big a subject for tonight but the word is revelation my brother and sister we cannot oh i hope i don't want to sound critical to no one but i hope we'll never come to the place that we'll say we have the word i read the word i believe the word but we are devoid of revelation this word is revelation this word is the very life of god revealed in this day and we cannot have this word and be filled with the holy ghost and not have a revelation of who jesus christ is it's absolutely impossible now i'll just bring this up right here as we'll go into the quote into the message uh spiritual amnesia now look my brother and sister as we'll look at this i hope this makes as much sense to you as it does to me did you know that cain offered as good a sacrifice to as a good sacrifice to he was sincere he built an altar he knelt down and he worshiped offered a sacrifice prayed to god and if god that's all god requires for you to belong to the church and have an altar and pay your tithes and go to church and live a good life if that's all he requires he was unjust to condemn cain now we're not in a baptist church and we're not in a methodist church amen but these spirits are still trying to knock at our door and come in those spirits don't care that we believe in a prophet in this day they could care less those spirits are wanting you to be convinced that if you acknowledge god sent a prophet and you follow in the guidelines of the message it's okay right that's the same patterns he doesn't have a different pattern for a message church than he did for any other church the devil is predictable he's cunning he's sly but he is predictable so if all of this right here was all that was necessary then he would have to not because it was methodist or baptist or nazarene right down here if that was good enough in a message church he'd have to go back and apologize to cain yes sir that's exactly but religion now how many of you read ahead there's no way to have much of a bang sometimes when everybody's already read it say yep amen amen yep yep yep amen i see where he's tying that back to this okay oh i'm just just trying to share just a little bit the joy that a person would share in fact i want to share a little of that joy did you know that our choice for a camp was the correct one because the scripture tells us to dwell together in unity in the spirit of revelation amen now i hope that isn't offensive to you but i believe we had a real unity amen i believe we that we were there and it was good amen now you yes sir that's exactly but religion means a covering and you can't be covered by your own good works there's only one thing that god will accept and that's the blood of jesus christ that's the only covering now my brother and sister when it comes to egypt god didn't say now if it kind of made you queasy to kill him and cook him then just buy four or five lambs and tie him out front and it'll be all right why because there was only one way that was by the blood so it didn't matter if it was squeezy i remember one time an individual telling me i just don't like communion and foot washing and i was like okay i got a little nervous all of a sudden it's like oh why don't you like that well i i don't like drinking out of a cup after other people and i don't like touching their dirty feet any of you ever felt that way i apologize in advance because you see they had not one revelation people are like well i'm afraid that i might catch something from someone the communion cup do you think god would let you catch the flu from something as sacred as taking communion are you afraid of touching their feet something you see we don't look at foot washing is sacred do we we should we should be it's a sacred ordinance given to us to fulfill to the coming of the lord but people look at it and go he's got limp between his toes i know he must not wash his feet when he showers he oh that's terrible that's terrible i just lord bless this brother that i loathe touching no saints let's get a revelation of this let's get a revelation if god asked you to do it then god ordained the results from it it's not hazard it's not some hopscotch thing that might or might not see this is god putting it in order for us to fulfill this and i'll tell you what it is if you feel that way oh i hope i don't skin anybody but if you feel that way you probably have come into communion unworthily because you actually have an ought against those people who aren't perfectly healthy like you so you can't be covered by your own good works only thing that god will accept and that's the blood of jesus christ that's the only covering now look i'm going to get sidetracked here for just a moment did you know that it's much easier to fellowship foot wash and do all of these things with people of your same peer group i think sometimes it's good if god sends somebody that looks a little more homeless or poor or a little whatever because you know the scripture says that we not be respecters of men but of persons but have we have we actually come to that place just saying just say it that's the only covering outside of that if you say keep the creed spiritual amnesia that's what happened now notice they have forgot their word now my brother and sister i want to ask you what's your word see we're living in a day that people are forgetting their word they are taking other things things that aren't necessarily wrong but they're actually placing them in a higher significance than god intended for it to be so they're forgetting their word they have forgot the bible he doesn't describe their word as anything else but the bible they have forgot the promise which was the very thing that afflicted israel in the wilderness god come after 400 years and delivers them just like he said he would and he said i'm going to take you into land that's flowing with milk and honey and if they had had a true revelation if we would have a true revelation we would not look at anything around us we'd be looking at the land and the milk and the honey and we'd be saying this does not matter it is that amen not to look in our present tense my brother and sister but look into eternity amen so it's hard for us sometimes because we get so caught up in our present tense and i'm guilty of that we get caught up in the present tense oh look at this oh look at this i just had a banker today i i say this as humor i i just had a banker today call me up uh paul is all well on the farm you know we owe him a bunch of money he wants his money back at some point in time and is all well is everything good how are your crops uh we're just kind of trying to find out how everyone is doing how are you doing yeah well look um saints it's been too hot and corn that should be 12 feet tall right now is eight feet tall and you should see the bugs you walk out in a field and come out you're just covered in all kinds of bugs and they're all eating my profit they're eating that money that i hope to take you out to dinner on and everything is just terrible is it really i have a decision to make that's it well i already made the decision god's either control or paul's in control and if paul is in control i suggest you guys either get off the plane parachute out or kick paul out of the pilot seat so we only have one position god's in control now brother branham himself says i get all nervous i get nervous about these things and i get anxieties and whatever else don't don't don't don't think you're backslid don't throw yourself under the bus because you get nervous of this but come to that place that you say lord i acknowledge you're in control amen we have several examples of the prophet of god showing us that he himself was human about this he was nervous about these things and all the pressure come upon him even brought him to a place he lied and you know why he lied pressure but the other reason he lied for us he lied to show now isn't that terrible people would be like god would cause him to lie you know no no he's a prophet you can't say that no i'm telling you everything that god did in this bible right here he did as an example to you and i that we could be in samples i believe is the word in the scripture could be the example to those behind us to our children to those we witness to it's not my brother and sister out of control it's god allowing us so i tell you instead of being the critic i'm a little off my track here forgive me but instead of being the critic that looks at brother brown said see now a prophet of god lied he couldn't be a prophet i'm over here saying thank you lord thank you lord a man that you would call to an office like that and under the pressure but the beautiful thing about it is when it was uncovered he repented praise the lord amen goes to pray for that baby amen right the lord says i'm not going to answer your prayer until you deal with this another example oh my oh well how can this be well i'll tell you how it would be god designed you he fabricated as it were fabricated you he didn't come you see when god spoke and made a fish he didn't have to go refer back to anything else the fish was the original creation he spoke of the bird it was original creation he spoke of the elk and whatever else original creation but when he come to mankind he said let us make man in our image amen was there wasn't three gods standing up there with a design board you know they didn't have one of them well i don't know if you guys have ever done any architectural type drawing you know if you got a nice board you know you you've got your arm and you can get everything in your circles and you can do everything god wasn't up there and he didn't look in a mirror either like norman rockwell well you guys have seen the picture norman rockwell painted of himself in the mirror that's not how god did it oh it said i'm going to make man in my image done hallelujah i'll shut up see they forgot their word they forgot the bible they forgot the promise they're trying to live if you'll bump that forward brother alex and they're trying to live in the clear glare of what methodist was or what baptist was what somebody else was come on saints we're right in there we're not living in a glare i tell you what now i i it's so easy to be misunderstood in this day i am not looking back to 1959 1961 1963 1965 i'm sorry i'm not looking back because the living word of that day is the living word of our day i don't have to look back to see that word are you with me when the prophet of god speaks or you read it however is your favored way to to be in the message you don't have to say now will it fulfill like it did there my brother and sister there's a promise in the word that it will and so what it is is we have to allow ourselves to be uncovered so that we can once again be covered amen to be the word in this hour that was prophesied to walk the earth today hallelujah so we can't just start in our original form and stay there here is the promise of the day and god speaking it through his word and confirming it again and proving that it is so and they still don't believe it spiritual amnesia that's exactly right total total amnesians i don't know if that's a word absolutely don't believe it at all and you'll see it my brother and sister you see it to come to a point look i'll just can i speak direct this evening people will say god sent a prophet the the seventh church ages and we see this and we see that and we see that and come right down to the point that it's god in you but in them and the very point that it would be god in flesh again they will say that can't be so because if he's in you he's off the mercy seat but it shows that they don't understand the word because a prophet of god in very clear words says that the mercy seat is in the heart of the believer amen and so then they find a reason to be able to put god back into a denominational setting that it there is god and look what the prophet of god said he said they've got god some doty grandfather setting off just observing what's going on wrong covering hallelujah because we got a covering that said when the mystery of god would be fulfilled it wasn't talking about some great uh something that was to be hidden twisted turn my brother and sister it was you and i with the word living in us amen the very life of christ in us and the devil come and say but you got upset or you did this or you did that we were just discussing this the other day now this is a little bit blunt my brother and sister and some people would just roll over to hear me say this but when the prophet of god is talking about a cross hanging from his mirror that cross wasn't hanging from his mirror to keep him from speeding that cross wasn't hanging there so that he would be this or that he brings it right directly in a context that there would be some pretty woman and he would turn his eyes now brothers i'm going to tell you there's not a man alive that is not under that same influence but we have a solution and god help us to look to the cross let's not hide it and let's not bury it and say not in our church we don't have those kind of spirits we don't do this no we're talking about human flesh hallelujah and so you see my brother and sister god chose a man oh don't you love this he chose a man that would stand and tell on himself he didn't say well i better hide that because that's going to damage my ministry 50 years from now but the critics go whoa he had a problem with women so do you buddy there's only one thing that cures the problem and while it's just a symbol hanging from the mirror it is a reminder we have a cross we have blood and we are covered we don't sit here uncovered unprotected we sit here with the power of the cross of the blood of jesus christ sealing us to the day of our redemption hallelujah can someone say amen real loud see it's not if we keep the creed i'm afraid saints and i knows i probably come across like hitting this a little hard but this is a very strong spirit and some people are like just do this just do this just do this just whatever they tell you to do just do this well that's good that's good i really have no problem with that but does it make you more spiritual if you listen to the tape at 2 30 in the afternoon or 4 30 in the afternoon if you listen to it when god laid upon your heart to listen that's one thing but to mark a day and a time to say i must listen no my brother and sister that's becoming tradition of men right in our midst god help us i want to be led by the holy ghost don't you i want god to come and i might be just totally there and then just be like hmm okay uh oh lord god of this evil age i'll listen to that amen put it on amen that's the kind of leadership we want amen we don't want to pre-programmed come on saints we don't want to pre-program god is tearing the cover off of these spirits that we would look and say lord i want to be led by your holy spirit i want your holy spirit to fall on me and seal me to the day of my redemption i don't want a man to take that position i want you to take that position lord amen but see they're total amnesians and they don't believe it at all my how is it that i thought i wouldn't have enough to preach tonight can somebody answer that for me oh mercy amen brother go to romans 4 amen what shall we say then that abraham our father as pertaining to the flesh hath found for if abraham were justified by works he hath whereof to glory but not before god see we can do a lot of things my brother and sister that might even oh can i just throw myself as an example i might do something that the church would say oh that was so awesome look at brother paul what of it tomorrow you'll see me i'll have dirt on my face well i had dirt all over me today amen not i'm talking natural nobody misunderstood i'm just talking natural see so we could come to a place we have something to glory about but not before god for what said the scripture saith the scripture abraham believed god and it was counted to him for righteousness so faith in god belief in god's word it was counted for righteousness and god is a just god so our action believing the word will stand and god will count that as righteousness for you and i this wasn't a one-time event he's laying a pattern for us to be obedient to the word go to the word and it be counted as righteousness now to him that worketh is a reward not reckoned of grace but of debt but to him that worketh not but believeth on him that justify the ungodly his faith is counted for righteousness even as david also describeth the blessedness of the man into whom god imputeth righteousness without works saying blessed are they whose iniquities are forgiven and whose sins are he's not talking about its sins exposed god doesn't view it as exposed god looks at it as i have uncovered this and they have come and said lord forgive me right according to the word and god is only looking at the covering he's not even bringing up here yeah i had a bunch of filthy things i had to cover in their life a bunch of stuff i had to get out and i was disappointed with them and i this no my brother and sister he comes down says blessed are they whose iniquities are forgiven our shortcomings are forgiven and who sins oh this disturbs my heart sins our cover hallelujah and it don't matter what man's memory is out here when god looks as we know according to the word he says i don't even know what their sin was because when i cover something with the blood it is so thorough i can't even go back to that in that beautiful blessed in the man whom the lord will not impute sin anybody blessed here tonight hallelujah i'll tell you what my brother and sister that word that brings blessing and covering to you amen brings an uncovering to others they can't hide their sin no longer what was not sin when jesus spoke out became sin to them amen what is this i'm not trying to interpret the scripture but this is just what come to me he takes away their excuse lord i couldn't serve you because of this lord i couldn't because of that lord i come on we all have one or had one what god does is he comes and brings revelation to us that i don't need an excuse i need to follow the word i need to go with the word let's hurry right along here amen ruth the third chapter now let me just interject this i cut this short so i wouldn't go too long and i've already gone longer than i planned look ruth look at ruth now here she is mobidus totally can't be in the lineage of god right she's a mobius come on right nobody's going to heaven but those in the message right so if she's not a hebrew or let's just call a jew if she's not a jew she's out forget it isn't that really strange right there in that little short pattern of time before our lord jesus comes he just keeps throwing in these women that most of us would have rejected she's just not good enough salman big handsome rugged warrior of the warriors you what you're backslid brother you marry her you've blew it but there again another vision or type of christ when he looked at rahab he saw one washed one whose iniquities were covered forever he didn't see an ex fill in the blank he saw a daughter of god oh hallelujah here's ruth all this is new to her she's never been in that kind of church services before she's never prayed that way she's never trusted god that way she's never and it all comes down to naomi says now ruth it's obvious you're in love with the guy and it's pretty obvious he's in love with you so what do you got to do ruth you've been uncovered everyone knows who you are knows that you are a widow now pardon me for putting it this way but i hope you understand why i put it this way you already been with a man i was methodist i was baptist office nazarene i was this i was already been with a man but god knowing that when he covers our sin and iniquity it's not found any longer amen so what does he do he doesn't send her down there and get he doesn't give boaz an anointing to get down oh i hope you guys get this he didn't give an anointing to boaz to go out in the field and bow before ruth and say ruth will you be my wife because there has to be a type that he carries through the word and so what does she do when she comes to that place that she realizes something's got to happen and she goes and she lays down and he says who art thou and she answered i am ruth thy handmaid look at the revelation right there saints i hope you catch it tonight spread it spread therefore thy skirt over thy handmaid she had already been uncovered and now god bringing the type of his word and covering her and she laid there an act of submission amen and he knew the word amen oh hallelujah can you say thank you lord tonight amen therefore that skirt spread therefore thy skirt over that handmaid i say tonight lord spread your skirt over us lord spread your presence your holy spirit over us sister amy when musicians come amen what was it this word that brought blessings and covering to you brought an uncovering to others now look at this i just want to go christ the mystery of god reveal here just real quick go through this i want you to go ahead and read ahead if you will is that terrible of me don't don't now please read this because when i read this i want you to already have digested what is on that screen now he's not talking about the church as in this little brick building here he's talking about his church the church is the blood of christ by the spirit because the life is in the blood that's the baptism of the holy ghost that baptizes us into his body that recognizes only his body his flesh his word [Music] yeah let's just take what what they put right there for information because on the tape you hear a thumb thumb brother random his body his flesh his word right here [Music] he didn't have another book he didn't have something else denomination won't never touch that it's a revelation she knows it so did eve know it but she fell but this one knows it oh hallelujah can someone get a little excited tonight this one knows it and won't fall she is ordained hallelujah amen whoo she's ordained to not fall she won't fail she is predestinated to it blessed is the man whom god will not impute sin you ministers know what i'm speaking of when there's a couple dozen of you sitting here see blessed is the man whom god will not impute sin hallelujah well i'll tell you what my brother and sister you read that quote you put yourself in there you claim it for yourself you say hallelujah you stand upon that amen because he has declared the word amen and how can brother branham say that because that's what this says amen he didn't have to go find something new that's what this says amen so he could just repeat the bible to you telling you denomination won't never touch that it's a revelation but as i spoke to you at the very start you wonder okay what are those words brother paul it comes right back my brother and sister this is where the word open to you it speaks they're not hearing but this bride is hearing this bride now don't misunderstand what i must say here this bride feels it you can say oh we don't go by philly oh come on this bride feels it she feels the presence of her bridegroom she feels the word speaking to her and she responds to that it isn't just a word that went out when that word went out it come upon her and it anointed her to stand and it anointed a ruth to go down to a threshing floor and it anointed oh hallelujah there's just way too many there's too many examples through the scripture and i won't want to drag it out but you look through the bible just look at all these stories rahab anointed [Music] come on you say why why her i'm gonna get sidetracked but i'll just i'll leave this hanging why do you say she was anointed because when them two spies come to her door she didn't look at him and say oh more customers she was anointed these men are of god something reached out and touched her even before she talked to them she knew oh i tell you that's what the word is doing to a bride in this day eve before it comes this word is touching this bride oh hallelujah oh hallelujah oh my gosh what's happened we've been uncovered [Music] and the holy ghost come covered us again with a different cover he didn't cover us with knowledge or intellectualism he didn't cover us with cash and cover us with authorities as it would be of man he covered us with his word and sealed us with his holy spirit oh hallelujah our chains are gone how can we just stand and sing that tonight amen i pray tonight that just touch your heart i'm not looking for emotion saints but i'm just looking at the joy to know that i was uncovered for who i was amen and that [Music] that can be taken several ways what the world thought i was god uncovered who i really was hallelujah and my sins that were exposed he covered him with his blood oh i discovered so many things in the bible oh can you say thank you lord thank you lord thank you lord [Music] seeing gray how sweet oh isn't it a beautiful sound [Music] was lost [Music] was grace that taught my heart to fear and grace my fears precious did that grace appear the out i first believed my chains are gone i've been set free by god
