to see all of the family brother Trevor sister Kerry trusts that you had good travels amen and sister Sue once again I'm telling your brothers and sisters just remember in prayer not too many of us drive 100 miles to church and she's here amen praise the Lord let's um I want to speak once again on our our journey thank you so much very very nice I just appreciated the song service the musicians the Lord has blessed us amen you know I was just sharing with brother Chris in the back that I have lately just very much enjoyed ministering on Wednesday nights it's uh it's been not a great deep Revelation but just as I'm studying looking through the word thinking about as it was what happened when Jesus was traveling the roads what happened not when he was preaching in the synagogue and not when he was there amongst all of the deity minded people that they were so important but he went out and just went down the highway the byway the past the trails and did it just happen no every appointment our lord Jesus has ever made he's kept amen amen and even when we didn't think that something would happen God's there amen all the time I want to title tonight's thought meeting our Lamb on the road and let's turn in Mark 10 . amen isn't it wonderful we can be out on the road whether it be traveling I was thinking today that caused my thoughts to go to brother vasili brother Sergey my brother and sister I know the years then I drove a truck every winter I listened to more tapes driving a truck than I probably did it any other time of my life because while I don't want to make truck driving sound like we just keep it between two lines and try and not run over the little cars uh it is still endless miles endless miles and I just remember those times of putting the player on Loop and sometimes listen to the same sermon four five six times in one day and hearing every time something I didn't hear before now to me that's God who is rich in Mercy amen because he didn't want us to just catch the cliches sometimes we get a little judgmental about cliches right well that's just a cliche is it Jesus Christ the same yesterday today and forever I pray never becomes a cliche I pray that it is so real to us that we get up in the morning knowing my God is here today and what he did for Enoch he's doing for me amen and just to hold that and so is I I've been studying here and I'm jumping a little bit out of order today because we'll see and we'll catch that scripture in Mark 10 but we're seeing that Jesus on the road up to Jerusalem and he's testifying to the disciples of what's going to happen but there was something else and I say I'm out of work with our lord Jesus traveling amen let's turn Mark 10 verse 46 to 52. and they came to Jericho and as he went out of Jericho with his disciples and a great number of people blind Bartimaeus the son of timis set by the highway side begging and when he heard that it was Jesus of Nazareth he began to cry out and say Jesus thou son of David have mercy on me and many charged him that he should hold his peace but he cried the more a great deal thou son of David have mercy on me and Jesus Stood Still and commanded him to be called and they called the blind man saying unto him be of good Comfort rise he calleth thee and he casting away His Garment Rose and came to Jesus and Jesus answered said unto him what will thou that I should do unto thee Endless Possibilities there the blind man said unto him Lord that I might receive my sight and I just want to say tonight Saints as I preached this to myself today in the shop by myself working had a little Revival now I don't have perfect eyesight but with glasses I couldn't see 2020. but tonight I would lift my hands in my heart and say Lord I can be so blind Lord I want to receive my sights I want to see you as you are I don't want to see myself in you as you see me in you Lord I want to receive my sight tonight I'm going to receive from you like I've never seen amen before now excuse me for being emotional but I've just had a little Jubilee in the shop by myself today because there's things in my life sometimes that I just think how pardon me for putting it this way but I think how could I be so stupid how could I have done and said and you know what I'm saying Lord I just want I just wonder Saints if Bartimaeus had a little deeper meaning in his life than just natural eyesight a little deeper there's something we'll touch on this if I get going here what will now that I should do unto thee and the blind man said unto him Lord that I might receive my sight and Jesus said unto him go thy way thy faith had made thee whole see this is the part of why saints that I think something more happened because whenever our lord Jesus ever told people that they were made whole he was not always dealing in the flesh here again I say Lord I want to receive my sight tonight but even more than receiving my sight tonight Lord Jesus I want to be made whole I I want I want all I want all the word that you have given for me be completely whole amen Heavenly Father we thank you tonight for your grace your mercy Lord we thank you for our brothers and sisters have traveled so far those Lord tonight are not with us we just want to remember Lord we just ask for your blessings upon this service tonight the name of Jesus Christ amen you may be seated now we see Jesus is as the scripture said on the road out of Jericho and he's on his way to Jerusalem if we'll turn to Mark 10 we'll just go back 10 and 32 we'll go back and catch just a couple scriptures that is there now we see that they were in the way going up to Jerusalem and Jesus went before them and they were amazed and as they followed they were afraid and he took again the twelve and began to tell them what things should happen unto him and my brother and sister will see that what he was speaking to the disciples they were not comprehending they were not believing that it would be possible that uh our lord Jesus would come to a crucifixion that he would lay his life down it was hard for them to Father they knew that there was many people who didn't like him and and had ought against him but still the struggle and the supernatural that was taking place but look at this is saying behold we go up to Jerusalem and the son son of man shall be delivered into the chief priests and unto the scribes and they shall condemn him to death and shall deliver him to the Gentiles and they shall mock him and shall Scourge him and shall spit upon him and they shall and shall kill him in the third day he shall rise again now this thought I wanted to bring as we're coming up into the Easter time here I wanted to kind of tie this together my brother and sister as as we move towards this we we look at this of what is happening God said everything perfectly in order amen so the time that he traveled the throughout Israel the time that he testified and there was healings Deliverance opening of the word was all culminating here in this time and I know this might sound a little strange if you'll forgive me for this way of putting it but it was all leading to the day that they would crucify him but my brother and sister this is just the as far as I'll go in my prelim to this my brother and sister he didn't go to Calvary and he didn't go because he needed to see or needed to have Redemption power he was Redemption power and all that was in Christ was poured into the church we have Redemption power and we have Resurrection power was he proving that he could do it no actually it's an interesting topic when you think about that the near Kinsmen which was Satan was afraid he would mess up his inheritance because he wasn't about to let himself die to see if he could raise again oh you say brother Paul you mixed up two scriptures no same story one in type one in reality now we look at this my brother and sister and realize that as as Jesus is going along out of Jericho he's moving along there with his disciples as a host of people and there was a great talmult as there and and they're they're looking uh many people uh the voices my brother and sister many voices praising him but there was also the voices the jeers and the shouts of the critics and my brother and sister just as it was that he was going for the first crucifixion the prophet of God indicts our generation for the second crucifixion of Christ and we see that it's come to a time that it is okay to shout and to jeer as it were to spit upon my brother and sister all of the prophecy concerning our day it is just a mere image of that day brought into our time for us and so it's there that uh Bartimaeus my brother and sister there was nothing he could do to change his physical need he's now a blind man and as we'll touch on here if in a moment moment he's a blind man and he has been reduced to a position of being a beggar and I I know I can't hardly fathom that well uh what it would be like not able to live a normal life but as we uh we'll touch in a minute the prophet of God talks about his wife and his daughter so we'll look at this and realize here's a man doing now all he can do to to bring a living to bring a a a a support into his household and he's been reduced to begging and I don't know if you guys have ever really been super up close to to Beggars I don't know that you you know have I I don't know your stories but you know you go to South America you go to Argentina you go to Chile uh and and uh in Chile they're they're everywhere and the panhandling people and they will stand in the street you will literally drive up to a stoplight and the guy will come from the side and talented they'll be out there with balls or even little miniature bowling pin looking things and they're juggling and they're doing all of this thing to your attention and when the light is ready to change I don't know how they know it's so perfect but when the light's ready to change they stop that they whip out their deal and they go to your window hoping to receive a payment and they can become quite angry if you don't support them others will come and they will spray your window down and wash your window and then act like you're obligated hey I washed your window pay me I never ask you to wash the window but yet there's something of a compassion in the human element that we would come and say well okay God has blessed us we'll we'll do this and and you know it's there and they use you might say all kinds of vices they will have their children with them they'll have things or what appears to be their children and they're just trying to get that but here's Bartimaeus at a time of his life that has been reduced to a beggar and it's nothing that he can change and as the day is coming my brother and sister there's a throne coming down the road no one made a public announcement that Jesus was coming but there is a great Toma it's a great noise coming up the road to him and brother Branham if you'll study this out you'll see brother Branham talks about well there there's a young lady there and he asked her and says now now what's going on well it's Jesus from Nazareth and he says oh my uh you know I I want to see him I want to and it's there that he talks about brother Brown lays it out that this friend this Friend helps him now my brother and sister we realize that this time this noise going on this deafening sound that is there and so verse 47 is we'll just touch on those not to reread them all but he hears that it's Jesus and he begins to cry out he doesn't just say well if by chance he would come to my side of the road if by chance he would he would notice me or if there would be something that would happen but there was something down in his heart that was in such dire need of a touch from God that he starts to cry out now the prophet of God I'm not going to read all these quotes but I'm just going to preach it to you the prophet of God says that it was there such a large crowd crowd so noisy that Jesus could not have possibly heard him now remember I was speaking to you last Wednesday of Jesus crossing over the sea to hear the hearts Cry of a wild man among amongst the tombs of gadera now there is no possible way that our lord Jesus could hear that but he heard it in the spirit he heard this now I want you to catch this that that man that is there amongst the tombs is so possessed by demons they control his body and they control his voice but I'm here to tell you when the seed of God is down in the soul of a son or daughter of God there's no way Satan can shut down the voice of the Cry of a son or daughter of God there's no way he might possess the body he might possess the the the the voice might possess the eyeballs the hands all of that but he cannot control the voice of the seed and so the seed was there and here I want to take that as a time so here is Bartimaeus and he is crying out amen oh thou son of David but the crowd is so loud whether they're praising or whether they're shouting in derision the crowd is so loud there's no possible way thank you Lord very good when it seemed like there's nothing we can do and our voice cannot be heard he hears oh I tell you we ought to be saying thank you Lord thank you Lord some Midnight Hour if you should find you're in a prison in your mind but the crowd was telling him be quiet be quiet be quiet because you crying out makes no difference I'm here to tell you tonight when our hearts start to cry out to our lord Jesus it doesn't matter my brother and sister what we think is going on around us he hears your cry oh and the Cry of a son or daughter of God just like a mother amen I'll take this back to the animal uh nature here my brother and sister you can have 500 cows out on the Range in a pasture and a little old calf go to balling over here and that old mama cow puts her head up that's the sound of her calf amen and when Mama starts lowing the baby says that's the sound of my mama and we as humans just say they're making a lot of noise but oh Hallelujah I'm glad my father knows my voice amen not only does he know my voice naturally knows the voice of my soul and when my soul is crying out he knows who I am oh Hallelujah Hallelujah amen this is the believer when Satan would tell you just hold your peace my brother and sister we should be crying out all the louder the minute that Satan says it makes no difference cry out all the louder oh my Hallelujah and he had his Doctrine right now sometimes I can say that we probably do get a little carried away on Doctrine but my brother and sister if we don't have Doctrine we don't have a church come as you are leave as you are that's what that really means when they say Come As You Are they mean you're free to leave as you are God says Come As You Are expect to be changed amen Hallelujah as I said Satan had control of the physical man amen God had control of the seed so speaking of cliches we often hear this deep call to the Deep and if we're not careful we just put that down towards yep yep you can't hear it without a deep coal well I'm telling you my brother and sister that's just not out here to to just anybody everybody that applies to you and I tonight amen why are we responding to the word tonight because there's something inside of us amen it's not just hey we're Christians and this is what we do no my brother and sister we are believers because of the call and we're able to respond to the word because of the call and the call can only respond because the seed has life if you plant a dead seed you are never going to harvest a crop and my brother and sister I've said this many times in the church I'll say it again tonight I believe the Vindication of brother branham's Ministry was not of healings and deliverances I believe the real honest Vindication of his ministry is the fact that the words that God give him to speak have come to pass just exactly as the word said it would come to pass so we are here as it were of the fruit of the ministry that God put through brother Branham and it proved that that was a true voice otherwise it would produce a spirit of denomination amen if denomination creates it then it will produce what it created now let's look at it just real quick I want to insert this my brother and sister those Israelis those Jews those people that were following Moses through the wilderness do you know that their life followed Moses's life and Moses never went in the Promised Land and because they were not following Jehovah they were following Moses they never went to the promised land now that can be taken any way you want to take it my brother and sister but that's why this message this Moses Ministry was absolutely necessary to break things down and put things in place and Elijah Ministry today absolutely necessary to break things down and put it in its right place and those Ministries are true and they are faithful but those Ministries my brother and sister pointed us to who Jesus Christ amen because when that Ministry comes to an end it can stop right there and people will stop with it but when you have caught the revelation of what God sent the ministry for Amen to grasp Jehovah amen has come the prophet of God lays it out Jehovah has come once again and veiled himself in flesh amen and that flesh is here tonight saying Amen to the word believing the word acting on the word holding on to that word now some people that say now brother Paul you're being negative on brother Branham no I'm not because you can look in the message and you will see what the prophet of God said his ministry was for I never called you to myself amen I call the people out to introduce them to Jesus Christ he himself said it amen and so we hold to that now the very words a man that Bartimaeus is actually seen come to pass in his life is not the words that the priests are preaching down in the temple my brother and sister they're preaching their version of it but here is Bartimaeus with a much deeper Revelation than they understand because he is as we'll hit the backstory in a little bit he is there acting on a conviction that God laid on his heart not on the priest's heart he's there responding to God's call to his life to his need his situation a priest didn't tell him go do this because the priest didn't believe in it right but Martinez did and it didn't matter how many critics were in the crowd God said when bartimaeus's Heart Cries Out I'll be there for him Now isn't that amazing people have their ideas predestination God's going to force something to happen no my brother and sister but God knew Bartimaeus was on the road he knew Bartimaeus that Dame was going to be on the road there amen I'll tell you whether he could see Bartimaeus or not whether he could hear Bartimaeus or not he would stop and be able to say bring the blind man because he knew he would be there well do we believe predestination that strongly I personally do I personally do no God did not force me there's something inside of me calling me there's something inside of me telling me I don't belong in this world out here I don't belong in this I belong somewhere else oh how beautiful Heaven Must Be the home I shouldn't I shouldn't make mockery forgive me so brother Brown says here in the message that the noise was too loud huh look at that I misspelled the word the noise was too lowed uh loud the distraction's too great but it wasn't about that anyway it was his heart there's where it was it all come down to the heart and so God hears that heart's cry just as he heard the man amongst the tombs he heard a heart's cry he hears it here and so that is you know the truth of it is that's how we reach the master my brother and sister will not be about how many quotes we quote of the message how well we can quote scripture from memory quote a message from memory how we can lay everything out just not one drop of that's going to get us in a rapture the thing that will get us in the Rapture is a heart completely sold out and committed to God Amen a heart that's why we call it communion that's when the heart sold out and it's one with God well I'll tell you what there's a lot of avenues could go off of that one right there now brother Brown's freaks of this friend helping now you know it's there you think about this I'm just going to take a little liberty tonight I hope you'll forgive me but I believe maybe this friend brother Brown was talking about was the one when they said bring him was maybe the one that when Bartimaeus he casts off his cloak and he stands up and I believe maybe it was this friend that led him to Jesus I tell you we need a friend I'll tell you in the natural we need a friend amen but I'll tell you what a friend can't do a friend cannot open the word to you amen a friend cannot heal you a friend cannot take all of these things and provide what we need by brother and sister but it's there when we look at this and realize how dearly we as humans need friends but you know we can't explain revelation we we can't sit here around the coffee table eating some nice warm bread maybe drinking a cup of that tea or coffee or something now let me explain to you what the third pull is let me explain to you what the Seven Seals are or the Thunders or the vials I'll tell you what we can do with words we can break it down and paint a picture right we can we can lay out all the foundation of the third pull but just because now we can put it on a page and line it all up doesn't mean it's Revelation to us and you cannot explain the Revelation but I tell you we do need teachers we do need friends that can say well I think this is what you're missing right here there's you know don't over complicate the seals don't over complicate the Thunders don't over complicate this stuff it's God in Simplicity and now look at it this way brother and then a friend will be praying for his friend or a friend you know for man or woman to to have their eyes opened amen that's what friends are good for friends are not good for keep doing what you're doing and you believe God sent a prophet you'll make a Rapture that's not a friend a friend is actually the one that boosts you to a higher place I'll tell you what probably should keep this to myself but sometimes the boosting is interesting sister Jerry and I was in a conversation the other day something about real estate and she just pops out of nowhere the big grin on her face you wouldn't have made it where you're at without me and I would not have made it where I'm at without you hmm I'm going to say that God divinely placed that friend right there as no one else was paying attention paying attention to Bartimaeus the friend when he said what's happening was there to say it's Jesus you need Jesus you need Jesus I'm here to lead you to Jesus we all need a friend like that we need a friend that's not ashamed to say I can take you to Jesus I can introduce you I cannot explain the revelation of the son of man or the son of David but I can come and I can introduce you and I can give you something to pray about something to look at something to look forward to oh I'll tell you what thank God for friends but something was happening my brother and sister that the crowd knew nothing about it's there as it is too far to touch physically now let's look at how God works in this case we see the man amongst the tombs way too far to be touched physically and we see here now that Bartimaeus is on the side of the road and the throng is surrounded Jesus and it's moving along with this loud noise and it's there that it's too far to touch but God chose a woman with a blood issue to not let her stand on the edge of the crowd this is why we should never stereotype what God is doing with each individual and so there God said it's not going to be enough for her to stand on the edge of the crowd and believe that God was here Jesus was there to heal her but what does God do he anoints her oh God help us to have this kind of Courage also to come and move and push through the crowd imagine what people were like I was this rude person just crawled between my legs and you just shoved me excuse you and she's going cause nothing was going to stop her from getting up there and touching the Hem of that garment oh my brother and sister the prophet chose us so clearly it was not the touch but it was her soul drawing virtue amen not touching the cloth as people today when Pope takes his trip and walks through the public and they all want to touch him they're going to get something from touching that robe my brother and sister it's not touching but it is the soul coming and drawing from the virtue of our Lord Jesus Christ and the word says that we can touch him by the feeling of our infirmities we can touch him by our need is it just because I'm sick I have a physical need I can touch him no it's a heart's cry and it transcends time and distance and will touch him no matter where we're at in a hole in the ground working in a truck working in an office building working whatever it is we can touch him and the power of God comes but I'll tell you what it takes more than just saying oh I think this will be I was just reading brother Branham was talking and and there is there is a a minister in the audience and he says now you brother Minister brother right there Lay Your Hand on that lady next to you her spirit's crying out Lay Your Hand pray God will heal her how it is you'd be sitting by there me you want meat meat but the man was Minister I just have to believe that he said there it is and that lady's healed God didn't say no I just need to raise up all kinds of great people sometimes he just raises up friend and the friends there don't give up keep pressing on it keep I'm praying I'm praying with you this circumstance in your life your family your health whatever it might be I'm praying with you what are we doing we're actually I hope you follow me we're actually leading them to Jesus amen when they're down and they're discouraged and they might have just said on the side of the road and said I'm Bartimaeus and I'm blind I'm a beggar who am I but friends I care Jesus stops and he calls for him to come and people said my you know be of good Comfort he he calls he's calling you of all these people oh I want you to catch this tonight Saints of all these people all these people he's calling you he's calling you he didn't call the whole crowd he didn't call all the disciples and all of Jericho he called Bartimaeus and we are here in an earth that is now numbered in billions and he called us out of that oh how glorious I thank you Lord thank you Lord Jesus oh my you know here it is there are some there though that are encouraging Bartimaeus and the beautiful thing about it is he responds and I tell you one of the most beautiful things that we can do as Sons and Daughters of God here again going back it's not a matter of explaining all the message explaining all scripture cross-referencing tying it together one of the most beautiful things in this message is a bride who is responding to the voice of Her bridegroom amen she is hearing his call in this hour and she's living what he asked her to live and has empowered her to live I'll tell you what how blessed we are when we listen and respond amen you know sometimes as married people we get bad habits amen sister Jerry will send me a text or maybe be I'll be in the same room and she'll ask a question and in my mind I'm saying yes no maybe whatever but I never ever give an actual response I tell you that spirit's crept into the church where God speaks to our hearts and we're like yeah yep that's right I need a change but it all took place not here it took place right here and that is not a response well it's looking for a response Saints amen so you know his request as we already touched on sorry I'm going to kind of be circling back a little bit but you know he says unto him Lord that I might receive my sight and I already touched on this I just got excited there whether it was physical or spiritual I come tonight to be touched amen you know I've got some needs in my own flesh you know my blood sugar issue amen I'm down because I've got to get serious about this I'm down to to eating uh I don't even know how to describe it because it's not even fair you people that like vegetables I don't want to demean them to you but do you know that they have done this they've made broccoli cardboard and my wife feeds me some of that do you know you can prepare cauliflower a hundred different ways but it's still cauliflower but God wants us to feed on the word whether the flesh says it tasted good or not it doesn't say eat the book if you like the taste it says eat the book oh Lord help us to eat the book oh my excuse me for getting excited hey my now look at this as we're moving on here tonight amen verse 52 Jesus says unto him go thy way thy faith has made thee whole and immediately he received his sight and followed Jesus in the way now I want you to look at this in comparison to the man that Jesus leads outside of the city leads him out down the road away from everyone else and boy I'll tell you what in our modern society won't even eat food off the floor hmm come on I don't mean any ill towards anybody who won't do it but you ever set in a piece of equipment long enough during a day you dropped that sandwich on the floor you scoop it up you blow it off and you chew it up because if you don't last chance Jesus leads this man outside the city spits in his eyes it says can you see and he says I see men as trees Jesus doesn't say well at least you can ditch the walking stick now you can park the dog or in bartimaeus's case you can park the Sheep no Jesus repeats the process takes two times for him to see clearly but look at Bartimaeus he has come in a sincerity he has come in a heart's cry Jesus doesn't have to spit in his eye he doesn't do anything and he's got his side again what is it the spoken word manifested there's what the word said it would be and I pray God returns that kind of power in our midst but first let him give us character to be able to deal with that power because without that character pretty soon we'd be standing up saying I did this and I did that and people would be flocking in because we want to be around that gift my brother and sister the gift that we have been given the foremost gift that we have been given in this flesh is to receive the word there's a gift if we never discern never speak in tongues never lay hands on for healing none of that ever happened to be able to say Thank You Lord that you gave me a gift to say Amen to the word and receive that word not just a passing but holding on to it amen so he says unto him go thy way thy faith had made thee whole and immediately he received his sight and followed Jesus in the way now I want to go here and God has a provided lamb amen and we'll touch on this look at this now and sometimes you think it's just these people up here in the front to get it no no I don't care where you are you just believe I don't care anywhere in the building he knows who you are and where you are now see if he is the same yesterday today and forever if your faith can stop him like Bartimaeus did you don't have to be a beggar you don't have to scream out like he did the scream didn't stop him he didn't hear that it's the faith that stopped him thy faith he didn't say thy scream has saved thee oh come on Saints are we grabbing that the scream didn't save thee it's I faith has saved thee see thy faith has saved thee my brother and sister we can cry we can holler we can scream I've been in church services where somebody come for prayer and the minister grabs Somebody by the head and practically give them Whiplash and dislocate their neck while they're praying for them oh we take this demon people are just like a rag getting jerked around and they scream at the top of their voice as though they're going to shout the demon out well how about we would scream at the top of our voice thinking somehow that's going to get God's attention when he heard our heart can your heart scream come on maybe you have a need tonight in your life Saints something that's very very serious to you I can't hear that heart scream but my lord does right now he's hearing every need everything that's in your heart everything that's stirring your life he's hearing that hey man we don't have to have it broadcasted in a great big shout to to the heavens kind of like when you're in Israel and the Muslims are there and and they've got their oh I forget what they call them the deals that are all they got these speakers on there if you're within Three City Blocks it is just rattling your eardrums they're going to make sure you hear that prayer but it doesn't change the people Underneath It All no matter how loud that speaker is and how they have so many intersecting speakers and so wherever you're standing in the city there you hear it but it doesn't change the people only a heart's cry only a Hearts cry amen so I just love that quote when I read that he didn't say that scream has saved thee amen you know I'm gonna put this way just just like Aiken never got up that morning and said you know what I think I'll go out today and go into war and I think I'll just kill my family he got up the spirit got on him he knew he was doing wrong otherwise he might have wore that Babylonian garment or presented it to his wife in public and he'd never went back in his tent and buried the bars of gold and silver and the jewels he knew now it's always interesting because in the word god anoints them to call Lots but God Anointed The Calling of the Lots just calling Lots my brother and sister you you no doubt at some point in your life somebody said okay we're going to draw straws maybe just having fun you know who has to wash the dishes draw straws well that's not going to guide you to any spiritual answer but God told them draw Lots and it started narrowing it down narrowing went down down down down into the tribe into the family into this portion of a family right down to this one and right down to this one and right down to when it come Akins time what have you done Aiken why have you transgressed the word God's very thorough my brother and sister and the word promised in this day that he because he loves us come on can we say because he loves us he exposes our sin on because he's trying to shame us or make light of us or degrade us he's accused the sin because he loves us oh to be loved like that oh amen so little did he know that was the day that he would meet his provided lamb somebody had to get Bartimaeus down to the road from Jericho to Jerusalem maybe a wife or a daughter guided him down there and his job for eight hours or ten hours was going to be begging and when they walked along maybe it was his little girl where do you want to be Daddy I don't know honey close to where you brought me last time and the little girl thinking I don't even remember where I brought dad last time I was thinking about playing with my friends or okay Dad how about right here she didn't even know whoever took part Emmaus down there didn't know that God counted every single footstep every stride and said this is the place of the time of the appointment for a Bartimaeus oh if God would do that for Bartimaeus won't he do that for you and I won't he guide you and I with such Precision that we'd say well I did this it was a mistake there is no mistake we are the Bride of Jesus Christ he's not leaving us out in the cold or letting us wandered Wayward he is very precise amen so there it was there was a day for him a time a place everything specific to meet his provided lamb and I'll tell you my brother and sister when we start our day we cannot know it our day will be I get up in the morning I say I need to take care of this and I need to do this and the day's over and I have not hardly done one single thing that was on the list but I was busy all day and I look back and say well what I did was necessary but how great is a day that regardless of what it's going to be Lord thy will be done I dedicate commit amen give to you this day amen Lord that you would be in control oh I'd be my brother and sister that's what our days ought to be Lord I want to go do this but if you got something different Lead Me Now I want to read to you here I want to read to you again from God has a provided lamb only this is a little earlier in in the uh deal and I I was going to quandary you know whether to start and work through this but this the way I chose felt like the Lord led me now Bartimaeus had two little turtle doves that would make do tumbles like little over each other and that entertained the people the tourists and they would give him money so here was his original living was with these little turtle doves that would do their thing and just like the musician people would you could hear the coins ching ching ching ching ching and at the end of the day he had his little lamb that knew how to take him home so then one night his wife got real sick and they hadn't had the doctor and the doctor said Bartimaeus there's nothing I can do I can't break that fever said he felt his way around the wall got outside of the house and said Jehovah it's touched me so much today Jehovah I love you and I believe you and I have I have nothing are you with me Saints I got nothing to offer to my God I got nothing to offer to the Lord I got nothing I can offer you I got two little turtle doves here that'll make my living by but if you'll just let my dear wife stay with me to help raise my child I'm blind I can't see if you'll just let my wife get well so she can help me around I promise you tomorrow I'll make great sacrifice and I'll take my little turtle doves up I'm offering for an offering for my offering you know what part of mass is saying Saints Lord I will sacrifice my job to serve you amen look at the world we live in my brother and sister how the workplace seemingly has more control of our life than anything else but I'll offer up my job Lord all offer up they say his wife got all right he took the turtle doves and offered them sometime after that his little girl got sick she was also at the point of death so he went out to pray again he said Jehovah I don't have nothing left but I've got my lamb and in days of lamb led the blind like seeing eye dog does now and they were trained to lead the blind and he had a lamb that led him to his post where he begged and he said the only thing I've got left Jehovah is this lamb he said if you'll just let my little girl live yet I yet I've never seen but she is such a comfort and when I stroke her hair see my brother and sister we have no clue what it's like to have a child I got to raise my children got to raise my two daughters I cannot imagine life what it would be like not to to even know what they looked like it's part of the whole identity of how we process and he says Lord I'm willing to give you I hope you follow this I'm willing to give you my sight my natural function just heal my little girl excuse me well I don't know what happened there that was a really big frog the only thing I've got left Jehovah is Islam if you'll just let my little girl live yet I've never seen her but she's such a comfort when I stroke her hair with my hands she loves me and I love her said Jehovah if you let her live I'll give you my lamb for a sacrifice now look at this amen well they say his wife got all right oh we're on the next one oh hit it back to the right place sorry and his his girl got all right and here she was going here he was going down to the temple with the lamb and the priests come out stand on the balcony said blind Bartimaeus where goest thou this morning and he said I'm going to the temple to offer this lamb for a sacrifice he said oh Bon Bartimaeus thou cannot do that I said I'll give you some money you go to the Stalls and buy a lamb and offer it he said I never promised God a lamb I promise God this lamb oh my brother and sister I never promised God that I would be a Christian are you with me I never promised him I'd be a Christian I told him I promised him that I would be his not just a Christian but I promised I would sell myself out and be his Soul possession oh there's a lot of difference would throw just any old lamb out there we can throw it out there make a term out of it amen make her cliche out of it my brother and sister God doesn't want us to offer something else he's wanting in this hour for us to offer ourselves a lot simpler to offer something else I never promised God Alam I promise God this lamb cannot give that lamb for that lamb is your eyes and he said if I obey my promise to Jehovah he will provide amen a lamb for my eyes amen and he had this cold October morning a lamb had been provided for blind bartimaeus's eyes said bring him here ladies hands upon his eyes and the provided Lamb of God opened his eyes he could have stayed with his own understanding he could have stayed with his own thoughts and he could have stood back and said well Lord you understood what I meant but when he made that he had a revelation my brother and sister that the word was his absolute and The Vow he made to God was over all other vows that he had made and even though that left him if you don't mind me demonstrating that left him sitting on the side of the road as a beggar with no lamb no turtle doves a plain old everyday beggar but he had a promise I obeyed the word for my hour I believe the word for my hour and I've acted on that word and he held down in his heart God would give him a lamb and I believe because of very words my brother and sister he didn't go up to Jesus and say I need you to provide me another lamb he said I need sight in these eyes I need to understand the word of God for this hour I need to be able to see it for myself I don't want a second-hand religion I want to see it for myself I want it to be real I want to be able to testify I've met God face to face amen I know this word oh he had this old October morning a lamb had been provided for blind bartimaeus's eyes said bring him here ladies hands upon his eyes and that provided Lamb of God opened his eyes I say tonight Lord touch me Touch Me Lord tonight I'm here to receive from you Lord my heart's desire is to receive from you Lord Jesus oh Hallelujah Hallelujah has a lamb come amen the lamb has come and he's touched us amen we're not the same people my brother and sister my heart breaks so I see people quit serving God go back to the world but I'll tell you what I realized in my troubled times of life pay now or pay later we're gonna pay yeah sacrificed now or sacrifice later you will sacrifice follow God now and you get to follow him later amen give yourself now and receive him later amen hallelujah isn't it good to serve the Lord hallelujah thank you Lord Jesus sister vika would you come Hallelujah Hallelujah we just call that good tonight I believe we've made our point and I say thank you Lord you led me to the place I could meet you face to face I didn't have to rely on a second-hand testimony and yes I think I would probably have qualified as a blind beggar but God in his grace and mercies opened my eyes open my eyes that I could see him see him in his glory let's just stand sing a song or two Hallelujah 148 with Alex reaching out to you dear Lord [Music] I'm rich
