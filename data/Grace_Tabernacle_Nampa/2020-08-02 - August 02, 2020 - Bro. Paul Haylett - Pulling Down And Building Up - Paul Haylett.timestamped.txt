[38:42] hallelujah good to be in the house of
[38:44] the lord today amen
[38:47] you know we just first off i want to
[38:50] just start off with a thank you to our
[38:51] sister
[38:52] sarah she's playing for us in this time
[38:55] of need even though
[38:57] her wrist or hand arm there still
[38:59] bothers her
[39:00] i say thank you sister sarah and god
[39:02] bless you for that
[39:03] amen what a real blessing real warriors
[39:07] my brother and sister always stand up
[39:09] when there's a need right
[39:10] amen we just are thankful to the lord
[39:13] for that
[39:14] now i would just like to start um in
[39:17] this
[39:18] thought today we have an announcement
[39:21] once again for youth service this friday
[39:24] evening
[39:25] at 7 p.m at brother chris and sister
[39:28] kristen's house
[39:30] and uh it's for mature 12 year olds and
[39:33] up
[39:34] and uh any parents that would like to
[39:36] help with a snack
[39:38] that would be appreciated i i would just
[39:41] appreciate
[39:42] as your pastor that um
[39:45] we don't put a limitation to young
[39:47] people right so if you're
[39:49] 25 call yourself young come
[39:52] um and parents please bring your
[39:54] children
[39:55] and if you need to carpool you need to
[39:57] help somebody give them a ride
[39:59] something because we we just i feel like
[40:02] this will be a very important thing our
[40:04] young people are growing up
[40:06] there is influences in this world and
[40:09] you might
[40:10] just brush them off and say this is not
[40:12] really that big of an
[40:13] influence but my brother and sister
[40:16] satan starts now i've often used the
[40:18] analogy of a weed
[40:19] the time that a farmer should kill the
[40:21] weed
[40:22] is not even at the point that he sees it
[40:25] but at the point he knows
[40:27] it exists and so we as
[40:30] christians should not say well when our
[40:33] children are caught up
[40:34] in this spirit of the age then we'll
[40:36] definitely pray through because the
[40:38] lord told us you know through the
[40:39] message to claim them now we claim them
[40:42] when they're right here and then we do
[40:44] everything that we can do
[40:46] amen to bring them up in the fear and
[40:49] ammunition of the lord we don't wait
[40:51] until it's
[40:52] a problem and then say oh church you
[40:54] know pray for my child but
[40:56] we want to and so i just encourage for
[40:58] those who are not here today
[41:00] please encourage them their children
[41:02] qualify that mature 12 year old and
[41:05] up we need to look at this and so they
[41:08] can objectively
[41:09] understand the influence of the day that
[41:12] we're
[41:13] living in in fact i so much so want to
[41:16] do this that
[41:17] i just want to share this quote to you
[41:20] amen can we pop that up brothers amen
[41:24] now this right here my brother and
[41:25] sister is a i think a very powerful
[41:28] quote
[41:28] uh the sermon without money or without
[41:31] christ did you know
[41:32] my brother and sister those parents this
[41:34] is this is the world of psychology and
[41:36] parent training and and these things
[41:38] it's prevalent in the world today
[41:40] they're starting to be a rebound of
[41:43] recognizing
[41:44] that uh whether you believe in a god or
[41:46] not you need to get your children on the
[41:47] right
[41:48] track in the beginning it's interesting
[41:50] to read this because they start citing
[41:52] all of these things
[41:53] that you're like yep that's the bible
[41:55] that's the bible that's the bible but
[41:57] they try to leave the bible out of it
[41:59] amen so they don't want to go there
[42:01] maybe they're leaving it out not to
[42:03] offend but my brother and sister you got
[42:04] two choices in this life
[42:06] you'll either be offending by the gospel
[42:08] or offended by the gospel
[42:11] amen there's no place and you think
[42:13] that's just message no my brother and
[42:14] sister
[42:15] you go back through history and you'll
[42:16] go back in ministers preaching the
[42:19] gospel 100
[42:20] 200 300 years ago said if this gospel is
[42:24] not offensive to the carnal man
[42:26] then you are not preaching the gospel oh
[42:29] boy
[42:30] hallelujah there are enticements for the
[42:33] young people
[42:34] the modern dances and the rock and roll
[42:36] parties and the music that they have
[42:38] that goes with it
[42:40] and it's all enticing for entertainment
[42:43] now my brother and sister we're not here
[42:45] to glorify these things but i'll tell
[42:46] you having been a teenager once i know
[42:48] it's hard for you young people to
[42:50] understand that
[42:51] but brother david and i were youngsters
[42:54] at one time brother tim
[42:56] amen youngsters brother trevor is on the
[42:58] cusp
[42:59] amen but we were youngsters at one time
[43:02] and
[43:02] and the spirit of rock and roll
[43:05] uh i can i personally tell you the
[43:08] spirit of rock and roll
[43:09] it has teeth it's like a bear trap
[43:14] amen because once it's bit you you don't
[43:17] just tell it to go away
[43:19] you have to pry it open and remove it
[43:22] from your life
[43:24] it's got teeth i don't care how good a
[43:27] home a child has been brought up in
[43:29] and how it's been taught to do right if
[43:32] that child
[43:32] hasn't accepted the experience of the
[43:35] new birth
[43:36] rock and roll music catches his
[43:38] attention
[43:40] just as quick as he hears it amen
[43:44] amen because in him is born in him by
[43:47] nature a carnal spirit and the power of
[43:49] the devil is so great today
[43:51] that till it catches that spirit of that
[43:54] little one now saints you know i guess
[43:57] as i've said before and maybe i'll just
[43:59] leave it at this
[44:00] the older i get the bolder i get because
[44:03] i am not
[44:04] really concerned with what people are
[44:06] thinking about me except please don't
[44:07] hurt my feelings
[44:10] amen but you see i'm fighting i'm
[44:14] fighting for you
[44:17] now i don't say that to be glorified but
[44:19] i'm telling you i've come to the place i
[44:21] realized
[44:22] this is who i am and what i was called
[44:25] for
[44:27] amen we're not going to just play patty
[44:30] cakes we're not going to sugarcoat this
[44:32] message
[44:33] we're going to tell the truth we're
[44:34] going to put it out blunt and if that
[44:36] offends you my brother and sister that
[44:38] means i'm doing my job
[44:40] amen praise the lord
[44:43] this friday evening 7 00 pm
[44:46] at brother chris sister kristen's house
[44:49] let's stand as we go into the word of
[44:51] god
[44:52] thank you sister sarah hallelujah
[44:58] nothing like being put on the spot i
[45:00] called her
[45:01] then i text her you need to do this can
[45:05] you do this
[45:06] amen here she is like a champ just
[45:09] coming
[45:09] without any preparation hallelujah
[45:13] i'd like us to go right into ephesians
[45:16] the first chapter verse 13
[45:18] through 23 amen as we would look
[45:22] just to lay down the basis of our
[45:25] thought today
[45:26] we are going to speak to you on
[45:30] redemptions manifestation once again but
[45:33] the pulling down
[45:34] and the building up amen now you realize
[45:37] my brother and sister
[45:38] everything that is pulled down
[45:42] must be built up satan
[45:45] would break down the word of god in the
[45:48] church
[45:48] in the family so he could build up
[45:51] something of his own
[45:53] god will tear down the spirit of
[45:56] laodicea
[45:57] in the church so he can build the church
[46:00] back up
[46:01] in the word amen you cannot say well i'm
[46:05] going to leave this monument
[46:08] in my life and i'll just add god to the
[46:11] monument
[46:12] it won't work you have to tear down
[46:15] those things to be built up in the word
[46:18] of god
[46:19] amen hallelujah
[46:24] i feel wound up already in whom he also
[46:28] trusted after he heard the word of truth
[46:31] the gospel of your salvation in whom
[46:34] also after that ye
[46:35] believed you were still that holy spirit
[46:38] of promise amen my brother and sister
[46:42] not a promise of a promise
[46:44] but the promise has been sealed
[46:47] in us which is the earnest of our
[46:50] inheritance until the redemption of the
[46:52] purchased possession
[46:54] unto the praise of his glory wherefore i
[46:57] also i heard of your faith in the lord
[47:00] jesus and love unto all the saints
[47:02] cease not to give thanks for you making
[47:05] mention of you
[47:06] in my prayers that the god of our lord
[47:08] jesus christ the father of glory may
[47:10] give unto you the spirit of wisdom
[47:13] and revelation in the knowledge of him
[47:16] the eyes of your understanding amen
[47:20] not what the prophet of god saw not what
[47:22] the evangelist saw not what the
[47:24] pastor saw what god revealed to you
[47:28] hallelujah everything they have done was
[47:30] to set the stage for you to see
[47:34] amen that the eyes
[47:37] of your understanding be enlightened
[47:39] that you may know what is the hope of
[47:41] his calling
[47:43] and what is the riches of the glory of
[47:45] his inheritance
[47:46] in the saints and what is the exceeding
[47:50] greatness of his power
[47:52] to us word you know if you take that
[47:55] phrase and you break it down
[47:58] the exceeding greatness of his power to
[48:01] us
[48:01] word you know what that says that means
[48:05] it was focused his great power amen
[48:09] was focused not just broadcast
[48:12] thrown out there but it was sent to us
[48:16] word and in other words god had a
[48:19] destination
[48:20] for the revelation of the word in this
[48:23] day
[48:24] amen he didn't just go scattered
[48:26] anywhere and said somebody will find
[48:29] this
[48:29] but it was a laser that brought the
[48:32] revelation right down to you and i
[48:34] oh hallelujah amen now people take john
[48:38] 3
[48:38] 16 my brother and sister and they say
[48:40] but whoa brother paul you would be wrong
[48:42] because god so loved the world that he
[48:44] gave his only begotten son
[48:46] for everybody that's right but god knew
[48:48] not everybody was interested
[48:51] amen there was just an auction the other
[48:53] day amen they sold
[48:55] i forget what the car was old studebaker
[48:57] edsel or something like that a car from
[48:59] way back when
[49:00] but you look at that auction you know
[49:02] and there was only just a few people
[49:04] bidding on it
[49:06] the whole world could have tried to get
[49:08] that edsel or whatever it was i think it
[49:10] was an edsel
[49:12] the whole world could have tried to get
[49:13] it but only a few people
[49:16] wanted it now that might be a poor
[49:18] analogy but i hope you catch it
[49:20] this gospel was given to anyone who
[49:24] would want it but only
[49:27] a few do
[49:30] wow so he said it's available to you if
[49:32] you want it
[49:34] thank you lord hallelujah boy i'll get
[49:38] myself so distracted today this is scary
[49:42] according what is the exceeding
[49:43] greatnesses to us
[49:46] according to the working of his mighty
[49:49] power
[49:50] which he wrought in christ when he
[49:51] raised him from the dead
[49:53] and set him at his own right hand in the
[49:56] heavenly place
[49:58] now we know my brother and sister that
[50:00] this right here is not
[50:01] a seat that is on the right hand of the
[50:03] throne
[50:04] but this is the authority and power of
[50:07] god
[50:10] amen
[50:13] far above oh here's that word i've just
[50:16] been
[50:16] caught on brother sergey you have caused
[50:18] me a lot of study grief
[50:22] i say that in humor unless it would
[50:23] misunderstand because this word
[50:26] is everywhere
[50:29] far above all principality and power and
[50:34] might and dominion
[50:35] and every name that is named not only in
[50:37] this world
[50:39] but also in that which is to come he
[50:41] hath put
[50:43] all things
[50:46] under his feet and gave him to be the
[50:48] head
[50:49] over all things
[50:52] oh my goodness amen to the called out
[50:56] that's right brother trevor
[50:58] head over all things to the church which
[51:02] this church which is his body
[51:06] oh hallelujah oh my brother and sister
[51:10] if god put such such a craving in a
[51:12] young boy he'd eat the pedal off a
[51:14] bicycle
[51:15] because he needed sulfur how much more
[51:18] so than the body of christ
[51:20] would be craving christ himself
[51:23] oh hallelujah it's like i don't need
[51:25] church i need
[51:26] god amen i don't need religion i need
[51:29] god
[51:30] amen i don't need some kind of big thing
[51:33] here
[51:33] i need god oh my
[51:37] which is his body the fullness of him
[51:40] that filleth all in all
[51:44] oh hallelujah thank you lord jesus for
[51:47] your word
[51:48] for father coming the word and by your
[51:52] grace and mercy the word
[51:53] is becoming us lord we can see the
[51:56] evidence of it lord to those who don't
[51:59] understand it
[52:00] that don't have a revelation of it lord
[52:02] they might say well what what are you
[52:03] doing
[52:04] what are you claiming what i'm claiming
[52:06] is my promise
[52:08] lord jesus christ
[52:12] lord we ask for you to speak today
[52:15] lord whatever the needs are of every one
[52:18] of these believers father may you come
[52:20] and satisfy it today
[52:22] in the name of jesus christ amen
[52:25] may be seated
[52:31] now to those of you that will catch this
[52:33] i will just state it up front so it will
[52:35] be obvious
[52:37] as i was trying to close out last
[52:39] sunday's
[52:40] service i originally started the service
[52:43] with uh
[52:44] i thought a very small plate but i
[52:45] stacked it kind of high
[52:47] and i i rushed my way through this
[52:50] thought that i want to touch on here
[52:52] for a moment today and i just felt like
[52:55] the lord wanted me to come back
[52:56] and kind of fill that out not just leave
[52:59] that hanging move on
[53:00] uh you know natural typing the spiritual
[53:04] and we'll get into that in a little bit
[53:06] i have a confession you know that is
[53:08] pretty obvious to those of you who know
[53:10] me
[53:11] and um i'm not much on all the birth
[53:13] signs i'm not much on all the books that
[53:15] talk about if you were born in the
[53:17] second cuffs of the third this of the
[53:19] whatever of the moon that was whatever
[53:21] that you'll act like this and this but
[53:23] sometimes it's really scary accurate
[53:26] amen it's sometimes really scary you
[53:28] know and sister jerry i'm not throwing
[53:30] her under the bus nobody misunderstand
[53:32] but you know she'd be kind of like take
[53:34] one of them little books that she'd
[53:35] found somewhere
[53:36] and she's like look look i want you to
[53:38] read this she does she doesn't even lord
[53:40] it over me
[53:41] she says i want you to read it for
[53:42] yourself
[53:44] ah let's see sagittariuses born under
[53:46] the blah blah sign are great at starting
[53:48] projects and very terrible about
[53:50] finishing them
[53:52] what are you trying to say sister jerry
[53:55] oh my brother and sister so here i want
[53:57] to just kind of work towards finishing
[53:59] you know and not not leave things
[54:01] hanging
[54:02] amen hallelujah but you look at this my
[54:05] brother and sister and realize
[54:07] that as we come down into to the
[54:09] position that god has called us to
[54:12] it says in verse 21 just to recount it
[54:14] to you from this scripture
[54:16] uh amen that it was there that far above
[54:19] all principality and power and might and
[54:22] dominion
[54:23] and every name that is named not only in
[54:25] this world but also
[54:27] not which is to come have put all things
[54:29] under his feet
[54:31] and gave him to be the head over all
[54:33] things
[54:34] to the church amen we don't need a man
[54:36] leadership
[54:39] we need a man in an office of leadership
[54:42] but he is simply
[54:43] as it were to be carrying the banner of
[54:45] the word
[54:46] amen when we start to have to create our
[54:49] own
[54:50] ideas and we have to start as it were
[54:52] splicing
[54:53] ideas my brother and sister we have
[54:56] stepped beyond amen
[54:58] him being the headship over the church
[55:00] so as you look at this today
[55:03] we realize once again just to bring
[55:05] these to your thoughts
[55:06] the definition short online webster
[55:10] definition of all
[55:11] is the whole or entire quantity so he's
[55:14] far above
[55:15] all principalities he's not just a
[55:17] little bit
[55:18] it says he's far above that amen and
[55:21] power and might and dominion
[55:23] now the word dominion has several
[55:25] aspects to it but i believe the proper
[55:27] uh one to uh express to you today uh
[55:30] would be dominion equals control so he's
[55:34] far above
[55:34] all the principality power and might and
[55:37] control
[55:38] amen god's above all control and every
[55:41] name that is named not only in this
[55:43] world but also that which is to come and
[55:45] so we look at this and realize that god
[55:48] has already
[55:49] he has already possessed every bit of
[55:52] authority
[55:53] my brother and sister that is necessary
[55:55] for you and i the prophet of god breaks
[55:57] it down in our terms and
[55:58] says that that very high price that was
[56:01] paid
[56:02] he chose to pay that for you and i and
[56:04] uh you know when you think about it
[56:06] we'll get into some quotes here and
[56:08] you'll see
[56:08] where i'm kind of trying i believe to
[56:10] try this together
[56:12] the price is very high my brother and
[56:14] sister because it doesn't matter
[56:16] whether we are simply an angry person
[56:18] with bitterness
[56:19] uh that and we would call that sin or
[56:22] you are the backbiter we would call that
[56:24] sin
[56:25] or you are the man filled with lust and
[56:27] we call that sin
[56:28] a man that is an adulterer we call that
[56:30] sin the man who is a liar we call that
[56:33] sin you see
[56:34] there is no degree of sin and so the
[56:37] price is
[56:38] a very high price even for as it were
[56:40] the littlest
[56:42] against the most major amen and so
[56:45] often times in our human element we
[56:47] would like to say well you know that
[56:49] brother
[56:49] that got out of prison back there in the
[56:51] carolinas and now serving the lord
[56:53] you know that uh the word says that a
[56:56] murderer can't go to heaven
[56:58] but my brother and sister i'd like you
[56:59] to go this morning and i'd like you to
[57:01] go and ask god
[57:02] yeah you know a freedom of information
[57:04] act and ask god to see the records on
[57:06] that brother
[57:07] and you will not find a single reference
[57:10] to him being a murderer
[57:12] in god's records amen now if it can go
[57:15] to that degree right there my brother
[57:17] and sister we'll come right down
[57:19] and the little things of our life now i
[57:21] know it's not you but it's people like
[57:23] you
[57:23] that have little nagging things that
[57:25] follow you in your life
[57:27] and you struggle with them it's called
[57:28] human nature it's called yourself and
[57:31] you fight with that and sometimes you
[57:33] think that uh
[57:34] these things just kind of overrule you
[57:36] you say well i can't really
[57:38] you know i should have brought this deal
[57:40] i i keep looking at it
[57:42] at home and it says you know you should
[57:44] go to church if
[57:45] and boy does it name a pretty extensive
[57:47] list of things
[57:49] that uh we would all go oh my goodness
[57:51] that's terrible
[57:52] but it's telling you it don't matter
[57:54] what you've done go to church
[57:56] amen because it's the washing of the
[57:58] water of the word
[58:00] it takes this away from you it is not
[58:02] self-loathing it is not self-pity
[58:04] it is nothing else of that degree that
[58:07] will take that
[58:08] from you but it is the washing of the
[58:11] water of the word
[58:13] hallelujah that is what cleanses us amen
[58:16] and so you know sometimes we'll look at
[58:18] ourself and we will
[58:20] feel pretty down on yourself now nobody
[58:22] get offended this morning i'm not
[58:23] preaching to you i'm preaching to them
[58:25] other people
[58:26] hallelujah you sometimes we come to a
[58:29] place that we think well you know
[58:31] i i i just i'm just not good enough i
[58:34] i just i make mistakes or whatever and
[58:37] you know you think that maybe this is
[58:39] possibly your issue alone
[58:40] you'll be sitting in church you'll be
[58:42] sitting in the home in the car whatever
[58:44] it might be and you might think well you
[58:45] know oh my
[58:46] i just don't have very much self-esteem
[58:50] as a christian now this morning my
[58:51] brother and sister except for someone
[58:53] behind you might actually see you
[58:55] and the others might catch a reflection
[58:57] off a window i might ask you to lift a
[58:59] hand
[59:00] if possibly sometimes you have
[59:01] self-esteem issues
[59:03] as a believer sometimes you don't feel
[59:05] worthy amen
[59:06] well i'll tell you what i'm not going to
[59:08] go there because i don't want none of
[59:09] you to be staring in the piano seeing if
[59:11] you can see the reflection
[59:13] but i'll lift my hand right in obviously
[59:15] there's times i have self-esteem
[59:17] issues as a believer there's times i
[59:19] think lord
[59:20] why would it be me why not someone who
[59:23] was a true
[59:24] warrior why me
[59:28] well you think this is your issue alone
[59:31] imagine the other day over in a little
[59:34] place i was having a meeting over there
[59:36] in topeka kansas
[59:37] and there was a boy a young preacher one
[59:40] of my first sponsors
[59:43] brother roy sitting here remembers the
[59:44] place and this and this great place
[59:46] there
[59:47] there was this minister had gone under a
[59:49] rule for a place in the side wall
[59:52] mashed him beneath that the little
[59:54] fellow
[59:55] was going to die his liver was bursted
[59:58] his spleen was
[59:59] knocked out of place tons fell on him
[1:00:02] and i said at the breakfast talking to
[1:00:04] the wife and i said wife you know
[1:00:07] if jesus was here you know what he'd do
[1:00:12] i said when he sponsored me talking
[1:00:15] about this little preacher
[1:00:16] when he sponsored me and now when
[1:00:18] brother brown says it
[1:00:20] i'm not trying to speculate or do but i
[1:00:22] believe
[1:00:23] this is the little minister's words
[1:00:27] that the prophet's speaking are you
[1:00:28] following me continuity
[1:00:31] when he sponsored me i believe that word
[1:00:36] he was sponsor christmas
[1:00:42] now if saying you believe the word would
[1:00:45] mean
[1:00:46] in this case he was sponsoring christ
[1:00:48] what would it mean my brother and sister
[1:00:50] that you and i people would say well i
[1:00:53] support or i don't support grace
[1:00:54] tabernacle
[1:00:56] well that's good you do whatever you
[1:00:57] want to do but you're not supporting
[1:00:59] paul
[1:01:00] amen when you say amen to the word
[1:01:03] you're supporting or sponsoring jesus
[1:01:05] christ
[1:01:06] amen so it's not so much that you don't
[1:01:08] like the way i pronounce
[1:01:10] the word or you think that i see it a
[1:01:12] little different than you
[1:01:13] forget about that stuff and sponsor
[1:01:15] christ
[1:01:16] say amen to the word and if you disagree
[1:01:19] with me go ahead and speak the words to
[1:01:21] yourself
[1:01:22] or even and say you know what i don't
[1:01:24] necessarily understand what paul said
[1:01:26] lord but i believe your word
[1:01:28] and i'll say amen to your word amen why
[1:01:31] the prophet told us you can't do
[1:01:33] anything else say amen to the word
[1:01:35] remember when people ask well what do we
[1:01:37] do brother brandon we go back to our
[1:01:38] churches and go
[1:01:39] he you know what that must have just
[1:01:41] baffled people the prophet of god didn't
[1:01:43] say oh no no don't you dare you got holy
[1:01:45] ghost now
[1:01:46] you've heard the word of truth you don't
[1:01:47] dare go back to your denomination
[1:01:49] no what did he do he said you go back
[1:01:51] there and you support that
[1:01:52] you say amen to the word of god why
[1:01:56] because he knew they wouldn't be able to
[1:01:59] stay
[1:02:00] well brother brandon we don't have a
[1:02:01] church to go to what do i do
[1:02:03] you go down to a good full gospel church
[1:02:06] that preaches that jesus is divine
[1:02:10] and get what you can get well my brother
[1:02:12] and sister regardless of all the
[1:02:13] doctrines and this and that
[1:02:15] and the other amen if it's the word we
[1:02:17] can say
[1:02:18] amen to the word
[1:02:21] but the prophet of god i believe also
[1:02:23] here i'm speculating let those that
[1:02:25] would say that
[1:02:26] i'm speculating i believe the prophet of
[1:02:28] god knew
[1:02:30] that people who didn't have a church
[1:02:32] would be moved enough by
[1:02:34] the holy ghost to find a church
[1:02:39] oh and i have to throw in at least one
[1:02:41] negative comment or i haven't done my
[1:02:43] job
[1:02:44] the prophet of god said will come to a
[1:02:45] day they won't walk across the street
[1:02:48] or drive across town to go to church
[1:02:52] amen well those two weren't said right
[1:02:56] together so we can't put them together
[1:02:58] you got no right well i'm sorry there's
[1:02:59] continuity there
[1:03:01] and then one will decide i'm going to do
[1:03:03] whatever i've got to do to be in the
[1:03:04] house of god with saints of like
[1:03:06] precious faith
[1:03:07] the other one's going to say well no
[1:03:09] that isn't i just can't do that
[1:03:11] okay no problem no problem i'm not here
[1:03:13] to judge it it's just
[1:03:15] pretty obvious
[1:03:19] you know sister jerry made me these
[1:03:20] cookies i probably shouldn't admit this
[1:03:22] but
[1:03:22] she made me these cookies yesterday that
[1:03:25] i'm not sure if they were supposed to be
[1:03:26] healthy or unhealthy but they sure
[1:03:28] tasted good
[1:03:29] amen and uh you know i took a bite out
[1:03:32] of them and the very first cookie i
[1:03:33] ate and i took a nibble of the chocolate
[1:03:35] chip and i believe it was a real one
[1:03:41] it wasn't just looks it tasted good and
[1:03:44] it melted in my mouth
[1:03:46] i was hooked but my brother and sister
[1:03:49] you see
[1:03:50] the scripture talking about tasting the
[1:03:52] good things of the gospel
[1:03:54] you tell me that you ever take a bite
[1:03:57] out of this
[1:03:58] that you're gonna go that tastes good
[1:04:02] no sir this right here melts in your
[1:04:05] mouth
[1:04:06] oh does it get bitter in our belly yes
[1:04:08] it does because the word comes along and
[1:04:10] says you know what
[1:04:11] you're not living right you're not doing
[1:04:13] this right you need to stop and repent
[1:04:15] over these things
[1:04:16] but you know what they overcoming i'm
[1:04:19] justifying eating more than one cookie
[1:04:21] here in case you don't know this
[1:04:22] amen the reminder of what is
[1:04:26] is brought back that you remember how
[1:04:28] sweet it was in your mouth
[1:04:30] and the bitterness of the belly fades
[1:04:32] away
[1:04:34] you know why that's how a a a sister a
[1:04:36] mother can have more than one child
[1:04:38] i've obviously never had a baby thank
[1:04:40] you lord
[1:04:41] uh but i've been there through the birth
[1:04:43] of three of them
[1:04:44] and uh if it was left as marred into the
[1:04:48] memory
[1:04:48] of that moment no woman would ever have
[1:04:51] more than one child
[1:04:53] but you see god has a way of bringing
[1:04:56] the sweetness
[1:04:57] of the baby that causes the mother
[1:05:01] to forget what it felt like to birth
[1:05:04] the child and so the birthing of the
[1:05:07] word in you
[1:05:08] and i brings about sometimes bitterness
[1:05:10] in our belly and it brings about things
[1:05:12] in our life that we have to struggle
[1:05:14] with
[1:05:14] but when we remember how beautiful the
[1:05:17] word
[1:05:18] and how it tasted and what effect it
[1:05:21] actually brought
[1:05:22] overall in our life you know as a mother
[1:05:24] would cuddle that baby
[1:05:25] and that baby turns into a cute little
[1:05:27] guy and grows up to be a rebellious two
[1:05:30] three-year-old you go through the cycle
[1:05:32] again why did i have
[1:05:33] another baby but then another sweetness
[1:05:36] comes along that child
[1:05:38] and it just keeps producing and bringing
[1:05:40] back until when a mother is old
[1:05:42] according to the word of god
[1:05:44] they look back and the blessing of their
[1:05:47] age
[1:05:47] is their children oh god
[1:05:50] we thank you lord oh that the blessing
[1:05:54] of the age is this worth
[1:05:56] word being birthed in you and i amen
[1:05:59] that we can be
[1:06:00] old we can be aged that we can be living
[1:06:03] as it were
[1:06:03] seeing the end of our natural life and
[1:06:06] we say i'm
[1:06:07] so thankful that this word was birthed
[1:06:10] in me
[1:06:11] hallelujah you see not our issue alone
[1:06:14] my brother and sister
[1:06:15] amen the little fella he was under a
[1:06:18] sidewall mashed him down beneath that
[1:06:19] the little fella was going to die his
[1:06:21] liver was bursted
[1:06:22] his spleen was knocked out of place tons
[1:06:25] fell on him
[1:06:26] i sat at the breakfast talking to the
[1:06:28] wife i said wife you know
[1:06:30] if jesus was here you know what he'd do
[1:06:35] i said when he sponsored me i believe
[1:06:37] that word he was sponsoring christ and i
[1:06:39] said that's a trick of the devil
[1:06:41] if jesus was here he'd go lay his holy
[1:06:44] hands upon him
[1:06:46] that boy would get well i don't care if
[1:06:48] his liver is bursted
[1:06:50] he would get well oh hallelujah
[1:06:53] amen he would get well because jesus
[1:06:55] would walk in here
[1:06:56] knowing exactly who he was
[1:07:01] oh come on saints i want you to catch
[1:07:03] this today
[1:07:04] jesus would walk in knowing exactly who
[1:07:07] he
[1:07:07] was he knowed his calling the scriptures
[1:07:11] was right
[1:07:12] vindicating in him that he knowed who he
[1:07:14] was
[1:07:16] not not no shadow of a doubt oh
[1:07:19] hallelujah now look my brother and
[1:07:21] sister the word says that the prophet
[1:07:22] for this age
[1:07:23] would be the first fruits of this age
[1:07:26] and if the prophet of god would know
[1:07:28] who he was without a doubt and that he
[1:07:31] had no
[1:07:31] fear and he had the word amen
[1:07:34] then the bride that come under that wave
[1:07:37] she
[1:07:37] will know who she is and she will not
[1:07:40] have a doubt she will not have a fear
[1:07:43] but she'll have a confidence hallelujah
[1:07:47] so we walk around with i don't know i
[1:07:49] don't know come on
[1:07:51] i'm not going to say you don't have it
[1:07:52] my brother and sister but i'm telling
[1:07:54] you the devil's trying to steal a
[1:07:55] portion from you
[1:07:57] you've got to come to the place where
[1:07:58] you say well brother paul my life
[1:08:00] sometimes the ups and downs and the
[1:08:02] sideways and my failure
[1:08:03] if i was to stand in front of my wife
[1:08:05] and children and say i
[1:08:07] am eva unequivocally a son of god
[1:08:11] called to fulfill the word they say
[1:08:13] daddy you you got mad yesterday and
[1:08:15] daddy you this and daddy you that
[1:08:17] i tell you my brother and sister there's
[1:08:18] going to come a day mom dad
[1:08:20] children that you're going to have to
[1:08:22] step beyond what you think you are
[1:08:24] and what the world says you are and what
[1:08:26] the devil says you are and you're going
[1:08:28] to haft up and say
[1:08:29] i know who i am i don't care what my
[1:08:31] condition is
[1:08:32] i'm a son of god i'm a daughter of god i
[1:08:36] am the word made flesh in this day
[1:08:40] oh hallelujah anything short of that the
[1:08:42] devil's pickpocketed you
[1:08:45] now i'll tell you my brother and sister
[1:08:48] i know a brother
[1:08:50] hey man i know a brother is in mexico
[1:08:52] city many years ago
[1:08:53] and he's on the subway and some guy is
[1:08:56] standing beside him and he keeps pushing
[1:08:58] his knee into the side of his leg
[1:09:00] until it hurts and he's like why is this
[1:09:03] guy doing this
[1:09:04] why is this guy doing this when he got
[1:09:06] off the subway
[1:09:07] he put his hand down there realized his
[1:09:09] wallet was gone it had nothing to do
[1:09:11] with the knee
[1:09:12] in the leg causing pain it was all about
[1:09:15] the distraction
[1:09:16] of stealing what was important
[1:09:19] and that's what satan's doing you say oh
[1:09:21] my brother brother paul you don't
[1:09:23] understand the pain our family is going
[1:09:24] through the circumstance i'm going
[1:09:26] through you don't understand what's
[1:09:27] going on me
[1:09:28] my brother and sister stop it's not
[1:09:31] about that pain that you're going
[1:09:32] through
[1:09:33] satan's doing that so he can steal from
[1:09:36] you
[1:09:39] but brother paul you don't understand no
[1:09:42] tell me
[1:09:43] i'm not without pain i'm not without
[1:09:46] memories that leave scars
[1:09:48] but i tell you i also have a revelation
[1:09:52] that anything that happens on this earth
[1:09:54] god allowed it to happen
[1:09:56] i'm not going to look at it i'm going to
[1:09:58] make sure
[1:09:59] as it were my hand is in my pocket on my
[1:10:02] wallet
[1:10:02] so that the distraction doesn't give
[1:10:04] opportunity to steal it from me
[1:10:07] hallelujah yeah see
[1:10:10] brother branham puts it right here
[1:10:11] that's a trick of
[1:10:13] the devil hallelujah
[1:10:17] he noticed calling the scriptures is
[1:10:18] right vindicating in him that he know
[1:10:20] who he was
[1:10:21] not a shadow of a doubt he'd lay his
[1:10:24] hands
[1:10:25] upon him and say son be well
[1:10:28] and walk out of there and i said there
[1:10:30] isn't enough devils in hell to kill that
[1:10:31] boy
[1:10:33] i said he would well but i said you see
[1:10:35] honey
[1:10:37] he was jesus the holy hands
[1:10:40] of god
[1:10:43] [Music]
[1:10:46] now the naysayers that want to say i'm
[1:10:48] picking on brother branham
[1:10:51] why don't you just shut off your
[1:10:52] internet right now because we're not
[1:10:54] here to be bound by those things
[1:10:56] amen left alone
[1:11:00] that would become an excuse for brother
[1:11:02] branham
[1:11:04] are you with me left alone he would say
[1:11:07] well
[1:11:07] that happened could happen because it
[1:11:10] was jesus
[1:11:16] in this ironic that the natural break of
[1:11:19] this quote
[1:11:21] fits perfect with our thought
[1:11:24] because we could stop right there
[1:11:27] and not go on with the rest of the quote
[1:11:30] it's broke off hallelujah but let's go
[1:11:33] on to the next portion of the quote
[1:11:35] amen said i'm a sinner
[1:11:39] now he's justifying why he wouldn't be
[1:11:40] able to go down there and lay hands on
[1:11:42] him
[1:11:43] come on i'm a sinner i was born sexual
[1:11:46] birth
[1:11:47] my father and mother were both sinners
[1:11:48] and i'm just a
[1:11:51] now i know none of you have ever talked
[1:11:53] like this to yourself
[1:11:56] hopefully at least not this morning
[1:12:00] i'm just a no-good nothing and i said
[1:12:03] but you know what
[1:12:05] the lord would give me a vision i hope
[1:12:07] you guys see the progression of what's
[1:12:08] happening here
[1:12:09] he's lifted up that if jesus was here
[1:12:11] he'd walk right in lay hands on him that
[1:12:13] boy would get right up out of that bed
[1:12:15] now he's coming in this place but the
[1:12:16] reason now that it wouldn't be is
[1:12:18] because
[1:12:18] i was just born in sin amen my sexual
[1:12:22] birth
[1:12:23] i couldn't do but you know what if the
[1:12:26] lord would give me a vision and send me
[1:12:28] down there
[1:12:29] then that would be different i said i'd
[1:12:31] go down there and lay my hands on him
[1:12:32] he'd come out of that bed
[1:12:34] if he gave me a vision
[1:12:37] oh here it is i got a vision hey man how
[1:12:40] many times remember those stories one
[1:12:41] that's stuck in my head brother branham
[1:12:43] goes to the house to pray for the baby
[1:12:45] god gives him the vision and in the
[1:12:46] vision everything had to be in a certain
[1:12:48] place
[1:12:48] and so as it comes the baby's there the
[1:12:50] mother's there brother branham's
[1:12:52] chomping at the bit to pray
[1:12:53] and he starts to go and he starts to
[1:12:55] realize well mother-in-law's got to be
[1:12:56] here
[1:12:57] so now he's just kind of visiting
[1:12:58] socializing as it were
[1:13:00] no doubt praying is he standing there
[1:13:03] where's the mother-in-law she's got to
[1:13:04] be in the picture
[1:13:05] amen the mother-in-law comes in the
[1:13:07] house he gets ready to go again
[1:13:09] remembers now in the vision that the hat
[1:13:11] had to be in a certain place
[1:13:12] and it's now sitting on the chair he
[1:13:15] can't go pick the hat up and put it
[1:13:16] there
[1:13:17] and he couldn't call up the
[1:13:19] mother-in-law and say you got to show up
[1:13:20] over here
[1:13:21] god's got to let this work has to come
[1:13:23] about it has to be brought about
[1:13:25] and so the prophet of god shows that and
[1:13:28] then when the mother-in-law
[1:13:29] talks her daughter in the kitchen and
[1:13:31] then she's there and everything comes in
[1:13:33] she comes in the living room
[1:13:35] amen and then they're going to be seated
[1:13:38] and she picks up the hat amen
[1:13:40] not the prophet of god making it happen
[1:13:42] not you and i making it happen
[1:13:44] but god promised it god gives it he'll
[1:13:47] make it happen so the lady picks up the
[1:13:49] hat
[1:13:50] steps over a couple steps puts the hat
[1:13:52] up where it was
[1:13:53] in the vision and at that moment the
[1:13:56] supernatural comes right down in that
[1:13:58] house
[1:13:58] brother branham prays for that baby and
[1:14:00] that baby is healed
[1:14:03] oh hallelujah now look if the lord would
[1:14:06] give me a vision right if brother
[1:14:08] branham would see exactly what it would
[1:14:10] be
[1:14:10] he would know who was in the room he
[1:14:12] would know every circumstances he would
[1:14:14] know the words that would be spoken if
[1:14:15] he gave me a a vision
[1:14:18] amen
[1:14:22] yeah you guys are reading ahead stop it
[1:14:28] me a vision and send me down there then
[1:14:30] that would be different i said i'd go
[1:14:31] down lay my hands on him and he'd come
[1:14:33] out of that bed
[1:14:34] if he gave me a vision hmm
[1:14:39] you know we don't believe this message
[1:14:42] by intellect
[1:14:44] we don't believe it by knowledge right i
[1:14:47] can go here and show you this scripture
[1:14:48] this scripture this scripture here's the
[1:14:50] conclusion
[1:14:51] my brother and sister all that does is
[1:14:52] give you an intellectual conception of
[1:14:54] god
[1:14:55] not one drop of power
[1:15:00] but we ought to be thinking yes sir
[1:15:02] brother branham didn't preach
[1:15:04] the intellectual mind's filter
[1:15:08] he preached the thinking man's filter
[1:15:11] amen we don't have to stop thinking when
[1:15:13] we come into the message
[1:15:15] then i got to thinking after all if it
[1:15:17] was the vision what was it
[1:15:19] it was the same dirty hands
[1:15:23] on him now tell me how many times
[1:15:27] that you have come in a circumstance to
[1:15:29] pray for someone
[1:15:31] and satan threw a veil of condemnation
[1:15:35] up in front of you who do you think you
[1:15:38] are to pray for this person
[1:15:43] um
[1:15:49] yeah it was the same dirty hands on him
[1:15:51] aha same man praying for him
[1:15:52] same dirty hands oh further thinking
[1:15:56] and i begin to think i am his

[1:17:40] about you amen it
[1:17:44] that's right are you with me amen this
[1:17:48] this conversation this is why i wanted
[1:17:50] you to see this that's why i kind of
[1:17:51] deviated
[1:17:52] from the whole thought i wanted to bring
[1:17:54] this morning because i wanted you to see
[1:17:55] this
[1:17:56] that what satan wants you to do is look
[1:17:59] at that
[1:17:59] and you him you say well say the devil

[1:18:02] this stop me from being able to pray no
[1:18:04] he didn't you stopped you
[1:18:07] you stopped you amen because you chose
[1:18:10] to believe what the devil said about

[1:18:14] you you made the choice
[1:18:15] the devil never stopped you

[1:18:22] the righteous one lays upon the altar
[1:18:23] makes intercessions for me
[1:18:25] he is my sufficiency he is my prayer
[1:18:28] he is my life i said the only thing that
[1:18:31] would make me put my hands on him with
[1:18:33] faith because i had faith in the vision
[1:18:36] oh look at this now i need a
[1:18:39] supernatural
[1:18:40] event to take place so i'd be able to
[1:18:42] pray for someone
[1:18:44] oh but look how god breaks that veil
[1:18:47] he's tearing this idea down
[1:18:51] oh hallelujah because i had faith in the
[1:18:54] vision
[1:18:55] without the vision the same
[1:18:58] faith would do the same thing
[1:19:02] oh vision or not i have a promise
[1:19:05] i've got the word i've got jesus christ
[1:19:08] himself he's on the scene
[1:19:10] amen i don't need a supernatural event
[1:19:12] whether i can pray or ask for
[1:19:15] or lift a brother or sister up i don't
[1:19:17] need that i have a promise
[1:19:20] and his promises are immutable oh
[1:19:23] hallelujah now without the vision the
[1:19:26] same
[1:19:26] faith would do the same thing so i can
[1:19:29] reckon myself
[1:19:30] nothing but reckon him
[1:19:34] my all and all hallelujah
[1:19:38] he is my life he is my commissioner yes

[1:19:58] that boy and that night he was in the
[1:20:00] meeting solid well amen
[1:20:02] my brother and sister you it's not about
[1:20:05] how you felt about today
[1:20:07] or yesterday or last week or last month
[1:20:09] or last
[1:20:10] year it's about what god said about you
[1:20:12] just follow the word
[1:20:14] look i have faith i love the lord he's
[1:20:17] my all in all
[1:20:18] i'm able to step beyond my circumstance

[1:20:25] mothers let your hand on your babies you
[1:20:27] don't have to worry about whether you're
[1:20:29] worthy or not god said you were
[1:20:31] righteous god
[1:20:32] said you were holy god said you were
[1:20:35] full of the holy spirit
[1:20:36] you take that word and say you know what
[1:20:38] i'm not feeling overly spiritual right
[1:20:41] now amen amen
[1:20:46] you know i was one time had the
[1:20:48] privilege of traveling with brother
[1:20:49] jewell a little bit
[1:20:52] i think i've shared a little bit we we
[1:20:54] preached at a church i preached in the
[1:20:56] morning
[1:20:57] it actually was supposed to be the
[1:20:58] opposite brother jewell was supposed to
[1:20:59] preach the morning
[1:21:00] i was supposed to preach the evening the
[1:21:02] church we were preaching at the pastor
[1:21:04] had never met me
[1:21:05] but brother jewel told him he says no
[1:21:07] brother i feel led let brother paul
[1:21:09] preach in the morning
[1:21:10] the brother said okay it's on you
[1:21:12] brother jewel
[1:21:15] well that got brother jewel nervous
[1:21:19] my brother and sister that evening
[1:21:23] i won't go into it you know the problem
[1:21:25] is is people think when the pastor
[1:21:27] preacher evangelist talks about these
[1:21:29] things if people aren't spiritual
[1:21:31] they don't discern it they think the
[1:21:32] man's talking about himself
[1:21:35] but the truth of it is you ought to know
[1:21:37] this guy
[1:21:39] i've insulted you i've told you stupid
[1:21:41] jokes that nobody got
[1:21:45] i've said your food was okay that
[1:21:46] offended half the sisters
[1:21:53] all god needs is someone willing that's
[1:21:55] if god was looking for the perfect man
[1:21:58] to carry the word the word would still
[1:22:01] be on the throne
[1:22:03] because there's no perfect man that's
[1:22:05] right
[1:22:06] but i tell you saints where's there in
[1:22:08] that service
[1:22:10] and i got to see in the morning
[1:22:13] what i preached and i just when we went
[1:22:15] to lunch i felt so bad i felt like i
[1:22:17] just butchered it
[1:22:18] like i wandered over here and wandered
[1:22:20] over there just like i'm doing right now
[1:22:24] in the evening service a brother said
[1:22:27] can i have a moment he stood up in the
[1:22:28] church and he spoke out some words and
[1:22:30] he said as they was
[1:22:31] preaching this morning this and this was
[1:22:33] said
[1:22:35] the lord spoke to me he no more than sat
[1:22:38] down another individual said can i speak
[1:22:41] and they started speaking and they sat
[1:22:44] down another individual stood up and
[1:22:45] said can i have a moment
[1:22:47] they sat down another individual stood
[1:22:48] up and said can i have a moment
[1:22:51] i thought wow lord
[1:22:54] wow lord something so disjointed
[1:23:00] that evening brother jewel preaches
[1:23:04] power of god moved down through the
[1:23:05] church
[1:23:08] people started coming up front brother
[1:23:09] joel said brother paul come
[1:23:11] we were praying for people saints
[1:23:15] they weren't just coming up there saying
[1:23:17] i i have a little sin in my life
[1:23:19] i need god to take it away let me tell
[1:23:21] you
[1:23:22] it singed my eyebrows some of the things
[1:23:26] they confessed
[1:23:27] the front of the church
[1:23:32] graphic
[1:23:35] we prayed i felt disconnected
[1:23:39] i felt literally it'd be like i was
[1:23:41] praying for sister nadia but i'd stand
[1:23:43] here and
[1:23:43] be like i'm putting my hand i felt
[1:23:46] disconnected
[1:23:48] i made a comment to brother jewel and
[1:23:50] brother jewell says well paul i felt the
[1:23:51] same way
[1:23:53] he said i felt like it was all happening
[1:23:55] under distance
[1:24:00] and brother jewel calls me one day and
[1:24:01] says brother paul you remember this
[1:24:03] situation
[1:24:04] yeah it's a complete deliverance
[1:24:08] brother paul you remember this it was a
[1:24:11] complete
[1:24:11] healing brother paul you remember this
[1:24:14] here with this teenager
[1:24:16] god delivered that boy amen
[1:24:20] hallelujah but i felt disconnected so it
[1:24:23] therefore couldn't have been effective
[1:24:28] no it's not about how we feel
[1:24:32] it's not about how we feel it's us
[1:24:36] saying lord i want to sponsor your holy
[1:24:39] spirit moving in the church today
[1:24:41] i'm going to say amen to your word and
[1:24:43] i'm going to say this is the truth

[1:25:00] gospel away

[1:25:12] over me saints

[1:27:51] this
[1:27:51] i hope you catch this the paradox of our

[1:27:56] a lot of poor people on earth today
[1:27:58] right
[1:28:00] amen be some even in our midst right
[1:28:03] here might be having financial struggles
[1:28:05] a lot of poor people on the earth
[1:28:09] they're so poor that all they have in
[1:28:11] this life is money
[1:28:13] [Music]
[1:28:17] are you with me did you catch it they
[1:28:20] are
[1:28:20] so poor all they have is money
[1:28:24] they have wealth they have the finery
[1:28:26] but they are poor
[1:28:29] because they don't have christ amen oh
[1:28:32] take this whole world and give me jesus
[1:28:36] amen hallelujah
[1:28:39] oh hallelujah hallelujah now in the
[1:28:42] sermon
[1:28:43] proving his word brother branham says
[1:28:45] this here
[1:28:48] my mail has shown is so
[1:28:51] much different than just letting them
[1:28:53] try
[1:28:54] to test their own faith now as i tell
[1:28:57] you every time
[1:28:59] i'm not trying to present an idea
[1:29:02] you say brother paul why do you keep
[1:29:03] bringing that up lately because i was
[1:29:04] accused of it
[1:29:05] and i'm going to shove this right back
[1:29:07] down the devil's throat i'm not trying
[1:29:09] to pull a quote out and make something
[1:29:12] out of it
[1:29:13] if you've got time i'll read the whole
[1:29:15] sermon of every one of these quotes that
[1:29:17] we're going to do if you've got the time
[1:29:20] hallelujah but some of us you know would
[1:29:22] say well brother paul okay so you know
[1:29:24] what you have the opportunity you have
[1:29:26] the message if you don't come
[1:29:28] this church will provide it to you amen
[1:29:30] you have the opportunity to go back and
[1:29:32] find the full
[1:29:33] context of it hallelujah
[1:29:37] my mail has showed that it's it's so
[1:29:39] much different than just letting them
[1:29:40] try
[1:29:41] test their own faith because jesus said
[1:29:44] they lay hands upon them
[1:29:45] they lay hands upon them and they shall
[1:29:47] recover now get what he said
[1:29:49] he didn't say they'd jump up and run up
[1:29:52] and down the floor
[1:29:54] they could do that but he said they
[1:29:56] shall recover
[1:29:57] is that what he said that's what he said
[1:29:59] that's what i believe
[1:30:02] he is here now the one who said the word
[1:30:06] is here to make it soul amen
[1:30:09] amen that's what he said hallelujah
[1:30:14] yeah we need to go further i've got more
[1:30:18] quote than they've got
[1:30:22] he is here now the one that said the
[1:30:26] word is here to make it soul
[1:30:28] amen we're just aligned short there it's
[1:30:30] all right saints
[1:30:31] proving his word go home read it amen
[1:30:34] so the point the reason i even put this
[1:30:36] in my brother and sister the prophet of
[1:30:38] god
[1:30:38] is declaring if dates matter to you it's
[1:30:41] strange to me that people put such an
[1:30:42] emphasis on dates
[1:30:44] amen but if the dates matter to you it's
[1:30:47] april 26
[1:30:48] 1965 amen it's right there it's closing
[1:30:51] down god knew he was taking his prophet
[1:30:53] home
[1:30:54] on a certain date he knew as he was
[1:30:56] filling out
[1:30:57] amen you might say uh bulking up would
[1:31:00] be a term that they use they write
[1:31:02] author writes a book the editor would
[1:31:04] send it back and say you know
[1:31:06] books that are only 200 pages don't sell
[1:31:08] well you need to have 300 plus pages
[1:31:11] so that people feel like they're really
[1:31:12] getting something so go bulk your book
[1:31:15] up
[1:31:19] well do you know god broke the book up
[1:31:23] he broke the book up hallelujah come on
[1:31:26] he could have brought it narrowed down
[1:31:28] so close to say look
[1:31:30] i claimed you you believe
[1:31:33] i will take you home and you'll live
[1:31:35] with me for eternity
[1:31:37] the end
[1:31:38] [Music]
[1:31:40] he broke the book up stories all
[1:31:44] kinds of stories of harlots
[1:31:47] drawn into the lineage of christ he
[1:31:50] brought stories
[1:31:51] of lepers who had inspiration and
[1:31:54] revelation
[1:31:55] to turn back and say oh i've got to go
[1:31:59] show myself to the priest but that's not
[1:32:01] the priest i need to show it to
[1:32:03] he's back here
[1:32:07] the book is booked up that you and i
[1:32:10] could see
[1:32:11] every single thing we would encounter in
[1:32:13] this life
[1:32:14] we would see it right here in the book
[1:32:16] and we could go and
[1:32:17] praise the lord i'm not the only one
[1:32:20] that has this trouble
[1:32:22] amen now pardon me i don't mean to say
[1:32:26] the book is just filled no every bit of
[1:32:28] this is a gold nugget
[1:32:30] every bit of this is the absolute truth
[1:32:32] of god
[1:32:33] amen this is jesus christ revealed on
[1:32:36] the written page
[1:32:38] hallelujah i hope you understand what i
[1:32:39] was saying are we okay
[1:32:42] okay hallelujah no my brother and sister
[1:32:45] you look at this now
[1:32:46] realize what god is doing he's coming
[1:32:48] here even in the title of the sermon
[1:32:50] proving his word hallelujah
[1:32:55] now look we've got to come to a place
[1:32:58] saints
[1:32:59] we can move beyond our feeling of i'm
[1:33:03] just no good imagine if the prophet
[1:33:06] never moved beyond that point
[1:33:09] what would we have for a message he'd be
[1:33:11] like paul i preached something i feel
[1:33:13] like it's a little hard and scraping a
[1:33:14] few
[1:33:14] elbows and knuckles here and then i
[1:33:16] apologize for it imagine if the prophet
[1:33:18] come
[1:33:20] like paul here does preached hard
[1:33:23] and at the end of his sermon i'm so

[1:36:10] in your presence and base among you but
[1:36:13] being absent
[1:36:14] and bold toward you
[1:36:19] as i was finishing up my thoughts this
[1:36:21] morning this struck me i thought you

[1:36:25] ministry
[1:36:26] that come down and controls

[1:37:01] personal thing direct right he preached
[1:37:05] the gospel without measure
[1:37:08] if it tore your head off i'm sorry if it
[1:37:10] laid you low
[1:37:11] i'm sorry but you see he didn't come in
[1:37:13] and dominate them
[1:37:15] he let the word come back
[1:37:18] that's how it's supposed to be my
[1:37:19] brother and sister the word coming back
[1:37:22] now look i'm going to be blunt this
[1:37:24] morning there's things that i see right
[1:37:25] here in this church i don't like
[1:37:28] oh is that are we all
[1:37:31] okay with that
[1:37:35] but you know what i'm going to do right
[1:37:37] i'm going to pray for you
[1:37:38] i'm going to preach what god laid on my
[1:37:40] heart and if the word won't change you
[1:37:43] nothing will amen
[1:37:51] did you know that clay
[1:37:54] can be molded into anything
[1:37:57] left into the in the rain will return
[1:38:00] back
[1:38:01] to what it was but when clay that has
[1:38:04] been
[1:38:04] molded meets fire it can never
[1:38:08] return back to its original state
[1:38:12] and the problem is we got so many people
[1:38:14] then been molded into
[1:38:16] message believers but they've never met
[1:38:19] the fire
[1:38:19] that's right amen oh because if they
[1:38:22] ever met the fire they couldn't go back
[1:38:24] out and become a good pentecostal
[1:38:26] a good baptist a good methodist a good
[1:38:28] lutheran they couldn't do it
[1:38:30] but without meeting the fire they can go
[1:38:31] right back
[1:38:35] yeah well i don't really like telling
[1:38:37] these stories but i'll tell you i know
[1:38:38] of cases of men their testimony used to
[1:38:40] be
[1:38:40] you know what yeah when the lord found
[1:38:42] me i was on a bar spool got where
[1:38:44] they're at today
[1:38:46] right back to the bar stool because they
[1:38:48] never met the fire
[1:38:50] amen saints i don't want this church to
[1:38:52] be molding good message believers
[1:38:54] i want you to be molded by the word of
[1:38:57] god and i want you to meet the author of
[1:38:59] that word
[1:39:00] and be fired that you never change from
[1:39:02] what god molded you into
[1:39:05] hallelujah
[1:39:08] that i may not be bold when i'm present
[1:39:10] with that confidence wherewith i think
[1:39:12] to be bold against some
[1:39:15] which think of us as we walked according
[1:39:17] to the flesh
[1:39:18] i'll tell you what i i got no one else i
[1:39:21] can't drag anyone else here for an
[1:39:23] example but i've had people say
[1:39:24] well you know what that was you just
[1:39:26] picking on people in the church when you
[1:39:28] said that
[1:39:29] i had no idea that you had that problem
[1:39:31] sister
[1:39:35] amen oh ouch how dare you offend me
[1:39:40] but honestly i can say from an open
[1:39:42] heart had no idea
[1:39:44] look brother david preached closing of a
[1:39:46] service part of
[1:39:47] end of a service he preached on
[1:39:49] dominating female spirits
[1:39:52] a lot of you went home no problem
[1:39:57] some blew up
[1:40:01] spent the next week looking for all the
[1:40:02] pieces of their brain because they blew
[1:40:04] up
[1:40:06] now my brother and sister if you don't
[1:40:07] have a dominating female spirit because
[1:40:09] that's not
[1:40:09] just stuck to our sisters right
[1:40:13] i don't know where i'm going with this
[1:40:16] how about we just how about we just keep
[1:40:17] going down that road
[1:40:19] did you know it's not just sisters we
[1:40:21] all saw a sister's suit just it's only
[1:40:23] here it's only here here here here
[1:40:24] here no sir it can be a man
[1:40:28] that's exactly right it can be a church
[1:40:31] that's exactly right
[1:40:34] it can be the ministry that's exactly
[1:40:37] right right
[1:40:39] amen and you know what
[1:40:42] if the preacher stands up here and says
[1:40:43] all you thieves you need to repent
[1:40:45] i don't have to blow up
[1:40:49] i'm not a thief you liars are going to
[1:40:53] hell
[1:40:54] i don't have to get upset if i ever tell
[1:40:57] something that would qualify as a lie
[1:40:59] i'm unaware of it and i'll repent of it
[1:41:02] but you see i don't have to blow up i
[1:41:04] just say lord forgive me
[1:41:06] but when you run into the devil
[1:41:10] head on that devil says
[1:41:13] i'm not about to give in i always
[1:41:16] remember this story as seven sons of
[1:41:17] siva
[1:41:18] amen they went in there they're going to
[1:41:20] fix this problem
[1:41:22] then demon says jesus i know paul i know
[1:41:25] but who
[1:41:26] are you hallelujah
[1:41:30] amen but look at this
[1:41:33] we walk in the flesh we do not war after
[1:41:36] the flesh
[1:41:37] why should my flesh war in a spiritual
[1:41:41] amen something's wrong
[1:41:45] something's wrong for the weapons of our
[1:41:47] warfare are not carnal
[1:41:49] but my god to the pulling down
[1:41:53] of strongholds you know what
[1:41:56] god help us now i'll probably be tested
[1:41:58] on this because the devil he doesn't
[1:42:00] like it
[1:42:01] but if the devil's got a stronghold
[1:42:05] he doesn't want the word to come that's
[1:42:07] it and start tearing it down
[1:42:09] now who should i use for an example any
[1:42:11] volunteers use for an example
[1:42:14] come on come on some of you smile and
[1:42:16] those of you breathe so
[1:42:18] everybody who breathes is an example
[1:42:21] my brother and sister i don't care who
[1:42:23] you are today including myself
[1:42:25] we've got a little something in our life
[1:42:27] we guard that's
[1:42:28] it we've got a little stronghold that we
[1:42:31] are
[1:42:32] guarding you say well brother paul i
[1:42:35] just it's the little thing that i'm you
[1:42:36] know taking what the prophet said what
[1:42:38] the word said and i'm keeping that
[1:42:39] covered
[1:42:40] that's good why don't you let the word
[1:42:42] come and tear it down
[1:42:45] why don't you just say you know what
[1:42:46] lord i'm i'm tired i i i know when the
[1:42:49] devil's here come on saints
[1:42:51] when the devil's here i need to cover
[1:42:54] that with the word to protect myself
[1:42:56] but we're not dealing with the devil
[1:42:58] this morning it's a holy ghost that's
[1:43:00] coming
[1:43:01] and says look i want to come into your
[1:43:03] stronghold
[1:43:04] and i want to tear it down and we're
[1:43:06] still covering it
[1:43:08] come on open it up my brother and sister
[1:43:10] let the holy ghost come in
[1:43:12] and tear down that stronghold
[1:43:15] the only way you'll find deliverance the
[1:43:17] only way you can move forward
[1:43:19] is to let the work of god come and tear
[1:43:23] that stronghold down
[1:43:25] oh hallelujah for the weapons of our
[1:43:28] warfare are not carnal
[1:43:30] amen and so you know when the preacher
[1:43:32] he might come and hit something that hit
[1:43:34] you right between the eyes
[1:43:35] don't sit there and say he's picking on
[1:43:37] me stop and say
[1:43:39] why would he say that does my pastor
[1:43:42] come and dominate my life is he telling
[1:43:44] us what to do
[1:43:45] is he trying to turn us from the word no
[1:43:48] no
[1:43:48] no no man now the word says you should
[1:43:51] say lord tear it down
[1:43:54] let it be tore out of my life lord and
[1:43:57] fill it with your grace and your mercy
[1:44:00] hallelujah because you see if we're
[1:44:03] fighting a carnal warfare here saints
[1:44:06] we're going nowhere we just got religion
[1:44:10] hallelujah because you see how it's
[1:44:12] going to come i won't name everybody
[1:44:13] we'll start on the front row
[1:44:15] this carnal warfare we're going to start
[1:44:17] fighting with sisters
[1:44:18] brother trevor and sister kerry and
[1:44:20] brother mason sister susan
[1:44:22] brothers david sister diane it's gonna
[1:44:24] just come down to this fight
[1:44:26] about you said i like and i don't and
[1:44:28] this and that
[1:44:29] and then this will turn into chaos and
[1:44:31] pretty soon there'll be a real estate
[1:44:32] sign out here that's right
[1:44:37] so if we can get any farther than seeing
[1:44:39] the preacher as some
[1:44:40] uninspired carnal man i'm not here to
[1:44:43] defend the preacher
[1:44:44] i'm telling you about tearing down
[1:44:45] strongholds if you can't see the
[1:44:48] preacher any more than a carnal
[1:44:50] self-centered man who's picking on you
[1:44:52] your
[1:44:53] stronghold will now get fortified
[1:44:56] but if you can look and say i came to
[1:44:59] church because i wanted god to deal with
[1:45:01] me
[1:45:01] i came today because i wanted to hear
[1:45:03] from the lord i want to be filled with
[1:45:05] the holy ghost
[1:45:06] i want to be a liberty then you can come
[1:45:09] and say
[1:45:10] okay the word says oh that our warfare
[1:45:14] is not carnal
[1:45:15] but it's mighty to god to the pulling of
[1:45:18] the stronghold in brother tim's life
[1:45:23] brother william's life
[1:45:27] my life my life there's nobody else in
[1:45:30] this building this morning
[1:45:32] might seem weird but i'm preaching to
[1:45:34] myself amen there's nobody else in this
[1:45:36] building can you take that position
[1:45:39] amen lord if there be a stronghold and
[1:45:42] casting down imaginations you know
[1:45:44] imaginations i'm going to speak bold
[1:45:46] here i hope i don't offend no one but
[1:45:48] imaginations can come right into this
[1:45:49] pornographic world we live in
[1:45:51] a man they can censor this and censor
[1:45:53] that and they can't get the trash out
[1:45:57] it it's a stronghold right satan's
[1:46:00] guarding that
[1:46:01] but we can come right down my brother
[1:46:03] sister and the imagination might be
[1:46:04] i'm offended i s and they must have said
[1:46:06] this that's it
[1:46:08] where's your patience according to the
[1:46:09] word for your brother and sister
[1:46:12] that sure seemed like they kind of
[1:46:13] insulted me
[1:46:15] now if i was brave enough i'd ask you
[1:46:18] how many of you i've insulted through
[1:46:20] the years
[1:46:21] but i'm not that brave
[1:46:26] but the imaginations can also
[1:46:29] come right down into the little things
[1:46:31] that's exactly right well i don't really
[1:46:33] feel like that word is for me
[1:46:36] you're imagining that god's not dealing
[1:46:37] with you
[1:46:39] god's moving right up the aisles of the
[1:46:41] church moving right down
[1:46:43] trying to deal with it he's not dealing
[1:46:45] with me he's going to be
[1:46:47] it's got to be for brother william all
[1:46:49] this is just for brother
[1:46:53] exactly william not for me
[1:46:58] it's a vain imagination this word is for
[1:47:01] everyone
[1:47:02] amen you see everything that it exalted
[1:47:06] itself
[1:47:06] against the knowledge of god hallelujah
[1:47:10] so why don't we take the other side
[1:47:13] and let it bring into captivity every
[1:47:16] thought to the obedience of christ
[1:47:18] why because see i want to go in the
[1:47:20] rapture with you when we get on the
[1:47:22] other side i know i've said this before
[1:47:23] saints and pardon me for just going on
[1:47:26] but you see i believe when we get on the
[1:47:27] other side god allows
[1:47:29] those who fellowship together amen to
[1:47:32] rub shoulders when we get in heaven
[1:47:33] now i don't have no scriptural basis for
[1:47:35] that i just kind of my own personal feel
[1:47:37] warm
[1:47:41] well hallelujah if not why don't you
[1:47:45] guys just go find a better pastor a
[1:47:46] better church a bigger place more talent
[1:47:50] but you're here because god put you here
[1:47:55] had nothing to do with men god did not
[1:47:58] do that
[1:48:01] we're not out proselyting people except
[1:48:03] for maybe what sister olga has done

[1:51:50] me
[1:51:51] you once had the opportunity to claim
[1:51:53] that title deal
[1:51:55] as a near kinsman but you
[1:51:59] knew the resurrection life lived in
[1:52:02] jesus christ
[1:52:04] and you once lived in resurrection life
[1:52:08] but you're not sure where you stand now
[1:52:10] and he says no deal
[1:52:12] because it'll probably mar my
[1:52:14] inheritance because when i'm dead
[1:52:17] i'll probably just still be dead i have
[1:52:19] no confidence that i have life
[1:52:22] so therefore you're on your own praise
[1:52:25] the lord
[1:52:26] jesus said no problem
[1:52:30] i'll take my shoe off i'll take it
[1:52:33] according to the word
[1:52:35] and i will cast it at the gate post in
[1:52:38] front of
[1:52:39] the foreign twenty elders oh i know
[1:52:42] that's not scriptural but you take it
[1:52:43] right back you'll find it fit
[1:52:45] amen take that shoe and cast it right
[1:52:48] there to the four and twenty elders
[1:52:49] and what were they doing they were at
[1:52:51] the throne hallelujah
[1:52:53] hallelujah my little daughter amen my
[1:52:56] son

[1:53:01] amen amen
[1:53:04] praise the lord oh sister sarah will you

[2:10:02] going to say well my circumstance says
[2:10:05] that our children are not going to serve
[2:10:07] god
[2:10:08] well good you just gave in to the devil

[2:10:45] right and your objective is right

[2:14:52] you'll never meet a man or a woman
[2:14:58] that gives god full liberty
[2:15:00] [Music]
[2:15:02] that can say god tore me down but he
[2:15:03] never built me up
[2:15:06] i tell you what happens when you see
[2:15:07] people that are saying well the lord
[2:15:10] you know i've become a christian just
[2:15:11] messed up my life
[2:15:14] reminds me of the little guys you know i
[2:15:16] think it's interesting saints
[2:15:18] i'm going to use little declan little
[2:15:20] samuel as an example
[2:15:23] nobody's going to have to teach them to
[2:15:26] put their arms around those little
[2:15:27] building blocks and say they're mine
[2:15:30] it comes natural you'll see
[2:15:34] over there now unfortunately for my
[2:15:36] grandson i want you to have sympathy for
[2:15:37] my grandson
[2:15:38] because you look at little samuel
[2:15:40] brother samuel
[2:15:42] he's going to grow up to be a bulldozer
[2:15:44] [Music]
[2:15:45] he's on the floor there one day little
[2:15:48] declan
[2:15:49] there was a little toy there and declan
[2:15:51] had it first
[2:15:53] i only threw that in there for humor's
[2:15:54] sake little samuel come over there and
[2:15:57] he was looking
[2:15:58] at declan holding on to this and
[2:15:59] something said i want that
[2:16:02] and he just coming saying we looked down
[2:16:04] and little samuels on top
[2:16:06] of declan pulling this toy away from him

[2:16:16] love both of them little guys
[2:16:19] but you see god tears you down
[2:16:24] and you say mine
[2:16:30] he can't build you up
[2:16:32] [Music]
[2:16:35] you got to say lord you tore me down for
[2:16:36] a reason
[2:16:38] it was something not quite lined up

[2:16:41] in our own eye we can't even see it
[2:16:48] god said no it's got to go away you got
[2:16:51] to go back down to the foundation

[2:20:15] hallelujah there's deliverance
[2:20:17] you know i'd go as far as to say because
[2:20:19] i know a church
[2:20:21] where the visiting minister spoke very
[2:20:23] strongly to him
[2:20:24] commanded him you might think this is
[2:20:28] weird
[2:20:30] there's nothing weird about the gospel
[2:20:33] you might think this is different
[2:20:34] visiting minister commanded them
[2:20:36] to walk out of their pew and walk around
[2:20:39] the front
[2:20:40] and whatever was on their heart a burden
[2:20:42] the last 30 days he said i want you to
[2:20:44] lay it on the altar
[2:20:45] and i want you to walk right out as you
[2:20:47] leave the church
[2:20:49] now i seem different my brother and
[2:20:50] sister but you know what happened
[2:20:52] going on the next week or two or three
[2:20:56] there was
[2:20:56] all kinds of miracles and deliverances
[2:20:58] happened in their church
[2:21:02] now i'm not going to tell you to do that
[2:21:05] but you certainly have the option
[2:21:07] take whatever it is it's when holding
[2:21:09] you back
[2:21:10] put it on the altar leave it behind
[2:21:13] hallelujah oh can we give the lord a
