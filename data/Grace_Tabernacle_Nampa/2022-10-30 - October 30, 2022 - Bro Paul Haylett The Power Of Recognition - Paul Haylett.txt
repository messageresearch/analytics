Montana has been on my heart this morning I don't know why I had a good talk with him a couple days ago and probably for an hour or more on the phone but he's just really been on my heart him and his wife this morning but Lord knows these requests when they cross that sacred desk this desk and they cross the throne of grace it's finished let's believe that why don't you stand with me this morning and let's just go to prayer our gracious father Lord as we stand humbly before the throne of grace this morning knowing Lord God these petitions these things that we've asked are not in vain you put them on our hearts Lord you know everything that we would speak that we would ask for before it was even spoken so father we turn him into your hand we give them to you and father we ask in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ that every need would be met every sickness that's here would be healed before they leave this place and Lord God every request Lord for these different ones is that our brother has read that's come across this desk Lord God you know the outcome you knew it before the foundation of the world that's the that's where we can leave it that's where we can take it we can just put it at your feet Lord knowing that it's finished give us the faith to believe if anybody's in our midst it's not feeling well you're healed by his stripes we're healed we just believe that Lord we claim it and I pray Lord God that the remaindrance of this service would be to your honor and Glory may you have preeminence may you speak father not the words of a man not the words of our brother Paul Lord but you speaking forth it's your voice that we hear and your word that's coming forth so we stand upon that Lord we believe it and we claim it and we take it in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ everything you have for us Lord and father may we not leave here the same may we be like those that come from Emmaus did not our hearts burn within us as you speak to us along the way it's you speaking father we love you Lord God I pray for my brother and and cousin in Montana right now Lord I don't know why he's so strong on my heart but Lord whatever it is I send forth your Holy Spirit to him that you would just touch him him and his wife may they receive just whatever you have need of whatever they have need of Lord from you this morning as they watch this service Lord God we love you we appreciate you we commit the remainders of this service into your hands and in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ we ask it amen thank you Lord see you amen As the deer and about Tim mentioned the two on the road to Emmaus and I was thinking you know I said did not our hearts burn within us as we talked along the way and then they got up and went to church they gone up to where the other believers were amen [Music] after thee thee you were alone all my hearts desire and I long to worship me you alone Are My Strength my shield to you alone does my spirit you you alone are my

beautiful amen just to know the presence of God having come down and just surround us stir our hearts how beautiful it is well sometimes you know people misunderstand things and I certainly don't want you to misunderstand anything this morning but you know we as Sons and Daughters of God when we would be in the house of God or maybe even wherever there's a lot of ways to express ourselves right some dance in the spirits some are you might say silent and don't move but their their spirit is rising up and reaching out to the Lord some wave a hand some clap amen and you say why are you saying this because I'm speaking to the Lord this morning thank you Lord for bringing our sister April home Healthy Back amongst us can we thank the Lord this morning yeah and connected you might say to our sister but she's my sister also in that unique about the body of Christ is that we have a family side that is genetic it is in the human element then we have a spiritual side which is genetic in a spiritual element and uh I just want to share something just so happens to be our sister April sister Andrea which we love very much as a sister in Christ and I won't read the whole uh email let me just give it to you briefly she's sharing this wasn't just to me it was to others she's talking about having cancer markers and these are cells in your body that they can tell have been touched by cancer and um she's sharing with us that they tested these levels this week and mine or half of what they were two months ago yeah we got a hand clap of praise for the Lord anyway she goes on to talk about the different tests and the different levels and um so here it is um one of those dropped from 60 to 4. my just a slight change amen and normal is two so she's almost back to normal amen second markers at 36 and considered to be less than 32 is normal the third one is now 60 and it is considered to be normal at 38. so what we're seeing my brother and sister is as the prophet and the word of God so aptly shows us there is healing and there is miracles and sometimes we try to say well God's just healing our sister I tell you it's a miracle because some Miracles are instantaneous and some Miracles God just allows our faith to grow and express and grow and express and grow and express and I pray that you will be able to catch this in case I get distracted today but this touched me so much because it fits very much with what the Lord's laid on our heart today because you see my brother and sister sometimes people have to have something definitive we're humans right we need something definitive but then there's this thing that God placed in us it's a seed Gene of God that's been placed in us and it's called faith and as Faith grows you see we are as it were a vacuum do you understand what I'm saying we are not an unlimited capacity we are vacuum in other words there is something goes in something has to go out this is why the prophet of God shows us and we'll touch on that today in just a minute degree but you see my brother and sister if you have more faith than doubt and fear has to leave if you have more doubt and fear faith has to leave you can't say I'll just include them both no it don't work that way amen so we have this capacity and as God moves in our life my brother and sister it is I believe your prayers that has had an effect upon our sister but you see what it is is God knows what we need to come and affect us to open up and say now I let go of fear I let go of doubts I let go of all of these things and I have now Faith to displace that and faith has such an effect on Sons and Daughters of God have you ever noticed that when the devil hammers on you you might go through a little season but do you realize that just because you go through that season doesn't mean Faith left that's only Satan trying to get you to let go of faith we hold on to faith God says they believe and I believe they believe because I put the seed Gene of faith in them and I gave them ability to believe and now they're exercising oh my oh my I'll get all excited here Saints but anyway lovely lovely email and I share just the Crux of that that she is claiming confessing amen her healing and it is coming to pass and we see God is touching uh our other sisters we've been praying for amen so let's just stand upon that promise today and not let Satan dislodge our our faith in the word I want to speak to you today on the power of recognition amen and so thank you very much enjoyed the song service today amen the power of recognition my brother and sister you see there is a power in recognition there is a a uh an opening a releasing uh that comes and as we'll look through the word of God today I just trust that um uh what the lord has laid upon my heart will I will be able to express it correctly amen let's just stand as we go to the word I want to go back to what I took as scripture in uh last Sunday and I want to um uh take out a first Peter the fifth chapter verses 6 through 11. uh the lion roared last Sunday and he roared on Monday and he roared on Tuesday and he roared on Wednesday and Thursday and Friday and Saturday and now we're back in church again and the lion is still roaring Hallelujah but today we're going to talk about another lying another lying lion I'll get tongue-tied here we're talking about another lion today but I want to bring this out felt it very heavy on my heart from last week to bring this out so that we could understand the context of the Lion and his impersonator yes prophet of God shows us that everything Satan's done has been an impersonation and you know as well as I do the impersonation is not as good as the original and so we also know that if there is a counterfeit there has to be a real and um I don't know if any of you have ever handled counterfeit money well Once Upon a Time years ago I I was working out of town I went to the bank and collected a few hundred dollars to um uh have make sure I had plenty of money in this small town we were going to work in and um you know I went to pay for my meal one evening and the man took the marker swiped it across the bill looked up at me and says see that I was like okay that is counterfeit oh I'm thinking he's calling the police now I have to explain everything where did I get this and you know um and this was a small town in Union house small towns are the little restaurant was connected to another form of entertainment that small towns have and the man just looked at me for a minute and I said I got it from the bank and he goes no problem and he went and walked the doorway comes back a few minutes later with my change he said they won't know the difference but it's the Holy Ghost In You that knows the difference between the counterfeit and the real otherwise the counterfeit would get passed off on you and you wouldn't know the difference amen but have you ever notice how God works in our life and when things you know like the little chime as it were the little arm something's not quite right because God made us to know the difference oh we didn't come to know the different Saints he made us to know the difference okay first Peter the fifth chapter 6 is through 11. humble yourselves therefore under the mighty hand of God that he may exalt you in due time in other words the exalting is coming but it's going to come in a certain season casting all your care upon him for he careth for you be sober be vigilant because your adversary now he didn't say it was God's adversary but it's the word in you so that automatically made it God's adversary but you see you don't see the devil knocking on the door of Heaven as it were the throne and throwing condemnation he comes to our doorstep he comes to our life he comes to our circumstance there's where the real battle has come down to come is with us your adversary the devil as a roaring lion walketh about seeking whom he may devour whom resists steadfast in the faith knowing that the same afflictions are accomplished in your brethren that are in the world but the God of all Grace who hath called us unto his eternal glory by Christ Jesus after that ye have suffered a while I don't like suffering I don't like suffering let me say it again I don't like suffering but for my Lord Jesus Christ I will embrace all suffering not for Bill Gates not for all the rest of these rich men not for the influential in the city but for Jesus Christ yes oh my yes same afflictions are accompanied in your brethren that are in the world but the God of all Grace who hath called us into his eternal glory by Christ Jesus after that you have suffered a while make you perfect establish strengthen settle you now look I I I'll forget about this I didn't really make a note out of it but I'm going to tell you right now I believe so much in the plan of God I'm going to stand before you Saints this morning and tell you I'm perfect some will say aha we know you better than that that's right you know this flesh better than that but you see I get to believe as it were you or I get to believe the word and so I'm going to say this morning I'm perfect anybody care to join me Hallelujah Hallelujah I'm going to make you perfect established strength and settle you to him be glory and Dominion forever and ever amen heavenly father just asks you to lead us this morning guide us father for every shortcoming every weakness father Lord how the devil would like to climb in the car and go to church with us but Lord Jesus we come here today believing your word and acting upon your word and father and courage in our spirit to just come closer to you Lord to live what you have already given us father to claim it in the name of Jesus Christ amen Hallelujah you may be seated Saints now I this morning would Desire by God's grace my brother and sister just to be very concise so I just asked for you just to say a little prayer that will just help me move right along now verse 8 says be sober be vigilant because your adversary making it very personal the devil as a roaring lion now my brother and sister I want you to see this it does not say he is a roaring lion but as a roaring lion so it's there that we see almost a symbolic reference giving us a mental image of Satan and I think it's good we don't want to downplay that because I believe anyone that would say well you know the devil is no match that's right but if we're under the bloodies no match where if In the Flesh he's more than a match but we look at this and see I I use this because I could not in my mind come up with a a better word but it's like a symbolic reference giving us a mental image of Satan as a great roaring lion I shared with you last Sunday about the lines that we saw up close in Africa many years ago and how it's just stunning you know to look at their nose and it's the size of a dinner plate and you know just the sheer Rippling muscle walking the string that is just displayed there and I believe that the word of God lays this out was anointed to delay this out to us to give us that kind of a reference to realize that without the Holy Ghost Satan is a lion in our house and so it's there by God's grace and mercy amen that we see he is not a roaring lion he is as a roaring lion but we recognize that there is a force behind Satan and my brother and sister sometimes force is not from brute strength as it was that he deceived that part of the angels in heaven he did not do that with brute string he did that with cunning and deceptive nature he did that in subtle fashion just the same as he displayed through the serpent in the garden it was through subtility and there is a certain strength that is inceptility I uh you know sometimes in your studies you look at things and you'll find my brother and sister there are people that are actually gifted now why the Lord would allow such things to be I don't know but there are people who are actually very gifted at being subtlet at being able to spin the tail to weave the picture and if you don't think so my brother and sister just talk to some of them Rich Nigerian princes that have taken about half a billion dollars from people in the United States because their little greedy spirit said you mean I only have to give you fifty thousand dollars to get a million I mean my anyone do that right right anyone want to sign up tens of thousands have and we say what really impossible no because you see it really isn't so much the gift that was in that person as the spirit that's in them is connecting with the spirit of the person there to deceive if all you can think about day in and day out is get rich get rich get rich the spirit of those who also want to get rich will come to you only their idea of getting rich is you contributing kind of like the guy on the internet who says why aren't you investing in this and that you can make 25 or 30 percent money you think they would really share that if it was real no they would put their money and make the 25 or 30 percent and do it again and again and again and again you are the portion they want to get rich off of now when you look about this Satan he was there he wants to be lifted up we'll touch on this in a little different fashion in a minute he's the one that wants to be lifted up over the congregation to have a congregation you must have people or the currency I want you to realize that Saints it's not real estate Satan doesn't care about real estate although he owns a lot he doesn't care about all of the fine automobiles and all the fine clothes the currency is humanity That's what Satan wants to be rich in he wants to be worshiped you never seen a house worship you've never seen a car worship you've never seen all of these possessions of Life Worship it is only Humanity that can worship so he is a great force not a whimpering kitten but my brother and sister you realize as it is that he's come and the image has been presented the word of God lays it out that he is as a roaring lion walking about now I want to make another emphasis because we'll tie this in later he's not just there my brother and sister to have influence but the scripture says seeking whom he may devour so there is something that he is going to do a great transformation in people's lives because you are not devoured by the spirit of laodiceem without it having an incredible impact upon your life you're not devoured by a lust and pride in all of these kind of things without it having a major impact on your life and so Satan is here to to Devour the people Amen to devour what he can destroy and as we'll go into second Corinthians here in the 11th chapter verses 13 through 23 we may not read all of them but we'll just start here for such are false apostles you know the scripture if you don't please read it for such are false Apostles deceitful workers transforming themselves into the Apostles of Christ in other words they were not the apostles but they had saw an image that had been placed by the word and they could look at that image and say I can impersonate that I can counterfeit that and so then they just transform themselves amen so they look at that and say I want to be an apostle of Christ and no Marvel for Satan himself is transformed into an angel of Light therefore it is no great thing if his ministers also transform also be transformed as the Ministers of righteousness whose end shall be according to their works I say again let no man think me a fool if otherwise yet as a fool receive me then I may boast myself a little now my brother and sister to have a minister as it were an apostle have someone come and say you know what I'm going to do a little boasting today uh most of us that would be a turn off but look at how he is coming now he is declaring to them that there are going to be these that are transforming themselves right not something else is transforming them it's something they did themselves that's the thing I love about the word of God as the prophet of God said you should not say I have the Holy Ghost it's a boastful attitude when you hear people in that context I'm not saying just the verbiage of everyday life that you would testify and say I believe I have the Holy Ghost we we're talking in a little different Nuance here it is those people almost defending or boasting I have the Holy Ghost the prophet of God says you should say the Holy Ghost has me amen that's where you're giving a complete surrender because as it is in the context of that one denotes I'm in control and the other denotes he's in control and so we want to always let our lord Jesus be in control amen so he's now coming he says you know what uh let no man think me a fool if otherwise yet as a fool to receive me then I may boast myself a little that which I speak I speak it not after the Lord but as it were foolishly in this confidence of boasting seeing that many glory after the flesh all glory also wow if I said that and said Paul says you guys would be like making a beeline for a door but you have to catch the point Paul is making let me put it this way to you Saints everything that the devil can boast of has already been boasted of yeah everything that the devil boasts that he can do has already been boasted of Sons and Daughters of God the poor guy is not original he's not original at all now I'm telling you my brother and sister speaking on the realm of original there's a brother in Africa incredible artist just such an incredible artist and many years ago when sister Jerry and I was there um you know I thought there was a picture that he had done and I just I was so mesmerized by that I just was like I I gotta own this and I asked the brother how much is this and when it equated out with a calculator from uh the Kruger or whatever they call that Rand whatever that thing is that they use for currency and it was only going to be like seven thousand dollars I decided that uh I probably really didn't need to own this picture so then the next best thing is is you know I I would settle for a copy of this picture when I found out that the copies sold for twenty five hundred dollars I decided I would take a picture of the picture and I would be good with the picture of the picture but you see the Apostle Paul is saying here that you know what whatever there is to be boasted on I can boast of it also amen the transforming power amen we just read where Satan would come and his servants would have a transforming power but we have a transforming power and the value of our transforming power is so much greater than the value of Satan's transforming power my brother and sister it's Rags to Riches stories always catch people's attention oh my this man come from nothing and ended up something but my brother and sister the wealth of the Rich Young Ruler was the same as anyone else when his life was called for amen no greater gift had God give to that young man than it would have been to sir have surrendered to the Lord and to give it to the poor but it's there that it's all in how we place the value and how we look at things amen so seeing that the glory after the flesh I will glory also for you suffer fools gladly seeing yourselves are wise for ye suffer if a man bring you in to bondage if a man may devour you wow no longer Satan as a roaring lion it's now come down to flesh and blood anointed by a spirit that would come and devour your lives huh my daughter Kristen told me about a card that she almost bought I'm glad she didn't he's talking about pastors in it for the outcome not the income wow the world out there is recognizing and calling it humor a spirit of a Devourer you see it's very subtle in other words my brother and sister when the devil goes to devour people he doesn't do it as a secret behind their back he is so subtle he literally tells them what's going to happen to them he allows it he doesn't keep them in a vacuum he allows them to see what the outcome will be and then convinces him that's really truly the outcome that you want there was a little Filipino lady went to church with us for a while here many of you remember her I'll be the backside the story that many of you don't know is about the time she quit coming here she started sending Paul emails about how she had friends that were trapped with a suitcase full of money in some airport somewhere I don't even remember where it was now Ethiopia and she just needed you know a few tens of thousands of dollars to Ransom her friends so the suitcase full of cash could come to America and then they would repay me in the hundreds of thousands of dollars for giving them tens of thousands of dollars to Ransom the suitcase and of course I spent all your money not none of mine but you see my brother and sister how subtle but yet the devil is so then you type it into the computer and it made Jerry and I wonder had she been fleeced herself was trying to get her money back because it wasn't a uncommon little um what would you call that a scheme or not uncommon made it all the way on the internet where are you going brother Paul every single scheme Satan's got in 2022 can be found on the internet be rich be famous be better looking be smarter lose weight I I you name it find love everything it's on the internet boldly before the people and the point I'm trying to make is people still fall for it people still pursue it because that's where their heart is and the Gospel of Jesus Christ can be found on the internet and people are attracted to it because that's where their heart is I didn't verify it the trash to the good on the internet runs hundreds and hundreds to one much more wickedness then there is good and it gives you a reflection as the prophet preached about one in a million it gives you a reflection of the spirit of the age that we're living in that literally it runs into all things my brother and sister it wasn't just something a prophet preached to a small closed audience that would believe it but it was there a reflection of the spirit in the world in which we live amen so if it's there let me hurry on here there's so many Avenues I was so Disturbed with myself you know because if you count the Avenues to detour here there is like literally a million like going to the largest city you ever thought without a road map or a GPS amen so you look at this now uh he's saying you know what if you suffer if a man bring you into bondage if a man devour you man take of you if a man exalt himself if a man Smite you on the face I speak as concerning reproach as though we had been weak how be it wherein so ever any is bold I speak foolishly I am bold also are they you know let me just come on I'm just having a hard time staying focused but look at this my brother and sister you see uh those of you and I I don't make sound bad or anything but those of you listening to Ministries the internet has brought a very broad spectrum you know maybe we have a a Ministry that we like to hear that edify strengthens us have you noticed I will speak for the bride of Christ first have you noticed that the ministry is getting bolder even denominational Ministry is getting bolder now I hope this wouldn't offend no one but I listened to a man on the internet the other day that we probably should invite to some of our big conferences and let him teach message people about marriage and divorce people blast brother Branham on his version of marriage and divorce well I'm afraid his version is not his version if you believe the Bible and read it it's God's version and I'm just going to say these words and I hope they don't offend no one but he said if a man does not have a revelation that he and his wife are one he has no revelation of the godhead pretty cut and dried yeah Christ in his church we look at this my brother and sister there is such strong spirits in the days that we live in going back to verse 20 real quick if you suffer if a man bring you into bondage if a man devour you amen this is the same devour as it is as Satan as a roaring lion seeking who to devour and a man take you a man exalt himself a man Smite you on the face of a man desire and in uh the reference of scripture we'll go to revelation 16. and verse start with verse 17. now I beseech you brother and mark them what devour yes think mark them which cause divisions and offenses contrary to the doctrine so Doctrine matters which he have learned and invite them for lunch on Sunday some people feel like Brother Paul's may be taking a hard line but I'm just following the word my brother and sister as the Apostle Paul's speaking to the Romans he said you know what you ought to do you ought to avoid them but how are we going to win them back by prayer amen look you go wrestle the pig you're both going to get dirty and the pig likes it is too blunt for you because Verse 18 if that's not straight Enough For You Verse 18 really ought to be straight enough for you for they that are such serve not our Lord Jesus Christ but their own belly and by good words and fair speeches deceive the hearts of the simple my brother and sister are kind of straightforward but I think we're coming into a time in the message in the world we live in today that it needs to be straightforward amen we're going to run out of enough sugar to sugarcoat the message my brother and sister and finally we're going to learn to take it as the straight as it were without water down or without being sugared up and that we'll be able as not people that are caught still drinking milk but meat hmm are we doing okay I don't need to apologize to anybody yet amen for your obedience has come abroad unto all men I am glad therefore on your behalf he's now changed a step right here because he's now declaring you know what you as Believers it has come as a notice to all men and let me just boast on Grace Tabernacle a little bit many people have passed through these doors and many people say brother Paul you go to church with a lovely lovely group of people the atmosphere the spirit that it's just that it's wonderful we're so happy to have been here and my brother and sister aren't you glad that was the day you chose to put on that certain demeanor or is that Who We Are is that what the word of God has done to us oh that doesn't make us all perfect every single day in every single circumstance but I'm telling you it is remarkable how the very nature or Spirit even in times of difficulty will shine through our attitude and will shine out even though the devil is right there chewing on your leg the devil trying to devour you with that moment and God still says I'm going to let my nature shine out of you while you're over here trying to kick the devil off and it affects us as humans my brother and sister and if God hadn't wanted it that way we wouldn't be that way but God made us there that we can go through the great trials as a devil trying to devour us and still the very nature and spirit of Christ will be their present and it is that the voice of God the nature of God who God is my brother and sister the prophet of God says the spirit of Christ knows the spirit of Christ Christ in you the Holy Ghost doesn't have any problem recognizing Who You Are so your obedience has come abroad into all men and I'm glad therefore on your behalf but yet I would have you wise unto that which is good and simple concerning evil you see my brother and sister we don't come to church and explain all the Deviant behavior of the world all the perverted nature of the world now that is not what we focus on my brother and sister we'll get enough dose of that just going outside the doors going to work going shopping whatever it is so we don't need to focus on that and so as we look at this and in a minute you'll say well brother Paul you're talking about the devil and this so far in the service I've only talked about the devil haven't I and that's good that's good I'm good with this because we're going to paint a contrast today don't you love contrast yeah yes and the God of Peace now some of you already read ahead I saw you watched your eyeballs going back and forth back and forth amen and the God of Peace shall bruise Satan under your feet shortly the grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with you amen so as the Apostle Paul has laid out this whole picture of the nature of Satan as a roaring lion and the nature of men who were men of Darkness but have been transformed under this anointing from the devil transformed into Apostles and and been transformed into light and they're attracting people to them my brother and sister he's laying out this beautiful picture but then again he tells you now it's going to be shortly just shortly here you're going to trample that underneath your feet in other words you don't need to worry about what is coming down the road God's already prepared you to rise if you're going to trample it under your feet you're not the one in the dirt that spirit is in the dirt you're not the one that's been overcome you're the Overcomer it's not you that's going to be here in this world in the Judgment coming and saying all Lord what happened you the Bride of Jesus Christ Sons and Daughters of God by Revelation it's being revealed to you and when you hear that still Small Voice say step up a little higher we don't argue why we can't do you realize Lord we're in laodicea the spirit of laodicea I can't overcome it no my brother and sister you can't overcome it and if you will now oh I'm going to get myself in trouble here but sometimes we need to be parrots I don't really like parrots you realize they're dirty little birds and they're not smart enough to learn the alphabet on their own somebody's got to teach it to them but it's sometimes for us to be parents if God said you're an overcomer I'm an overcomer I'm going to live before the throne I'm gonna live before the throne I'm going to be at the marriage supper I'll be at the marriage supper your flash might not even agree with you your flesh it's called condemnation your flesh is going to say you don't live that high but the word says you are now who are we going to believe or flesh or the word because if you believe the flesh let's all dismiss and go for pizza because that's as close as we're going to get so look at this now Saints Satan transforms himself into an angel of Light what do you want you to look at is what he wants to appear as I was listening to a man who pretty much has devoted his whole life to finding every flaw there is in the Catholic church mostly with Pope and he's got a huge list of contradictions of the Catholic Church things that are said and then at some other point in time repeated in an entirely different fashion some have credited this man with causing the Catholic Church to go back and change some of their doctrines policies because he's exposed but the one thing he'll never be able no matter how mad or great this man is and his ability to research he'll never be able to take away from a real true Catholic the revelation of Catholicism all his work won't take it away from them and the next step of his work is many will come out and go right over into Catholicism with another name our church says our literature says our Bible says and once they've been dislodged from their original position the majority of them will never be dislodged again because it actually turns out to be a traumatic event it severs families it severs friendships it severs all kinds of relationships and people say you know we've left a church once not doing it again but the one who's dislodged because of a deep hunger the one who's dislodged because their soul can't be satisfied no one who realizes this was a transformation of light and this is light what a difference yeah see you can be transformed my brother and sister without the core being changed in the day that we live in it's called plastic surgery doesn't change the inside at all can make the outside more beautiful sorry sisters well I know some brothers might have had I don't know did I use Brothers I didn't mean that women men you know the other day I was talking to a friend of mine I called him brother and he just looked at me real weird but I just just said maybe I'm being hopeful my brother and sister you see what's happening is is these Transformations that are taking place how this is shining there now the prophet of God talks about a glare and a real light and so you see the transformation brings and it comes to a place just in my research and studies the other day once again coming across the deal a man saying well you know the Trinity is so complicated and such a revelation it can't be explained this is after he had talked for 40 minutes on the evidence of the trinity and then because it doesn't appear that he made much progress he says it can't be this described or explained because it's so deep the man he was debating said it's so deep because you can't find it you're still digging to find it my Bible has it right here so you see my brother and sister at the end of that you'll realize more than likely that debate never changed a single opinion let me hurry on these are all the side notes that tumbled through my head I'll get to my sermon here in a minute amen now I would just like to ask everyone have you ever asked yourself how can I overcome a little something in your life a little little issue there might be if you're used to kids or stealing the cookie out of the cookie jar read a little story about a kid and it just loves stealing cookies out of the cookie jar got to the point the mom kept an inventory on the cookies in the cookie jar because little Johnny was wasn't his real name but I don't think there's any Johnny's here today stole cookies finally the mom said if cookies are missing out the cookie jar I'm going to whip you and he literally sat down on a piece of paper at the kitchen table and scribbling notes on it and the mother said what are you doing he said I'm trying to figure out if it's worth it or not how can I overcome I think it's a question that many of us have asked look talking about our lord Jesus Temptation was for him you know that the Bible said he was tempted in all points like we are yet without sin he was tempted by drinking he was tempted by women he was tempted by everything that could be tempted by he was tempted by everything that we are imagine that that leaves us with no excuse we say well that there was things there wasn't things then as they are now saying spirits it's just now refined into a electronic and Etc amen he was a man and yet you couldn't put a mark on him yes sir overcome means to recognize the devil in every one of his tricks amen I want to be an overcomer amen recognizing that was where the title of my sermon today come from my brother and sister you see the power of recognizing now this is not confined as it was I said to you about the devil but you look at this and we start to recognize the tricks that Satan uses we start to use uh his own actions as it were against him we see what he's doing to recognize the devil in every one of his tricks a lot of people says there is no devil it's just a thought don't you believe that there's a real devil he's just as real as you are or anybody a real devil and you must recognize him real real amen let's not just get into the point you know people casually like do something and you know some people that maybe don't have a the depth of Revelation or something and they say the devil made me do it you know what they're actually acknowledging it's not the devil coming were as it were just casually come by but the devil then has control of their atmosphere the devil made me do it in other words he come into my atmosphere and he tricked me okay let's deal with your atmosphere then you're focused on the devil maybe we ought to focus on the atmosphere amen my brother and sisters as it was I preached many years ago at a church dedication it's there my brother and sister the day that we live in is not the time for us to worry about keeping the devil out of the church had a lot of people frown at me a lot of people frowned at me and I'm not trying to exaggerate that they didn't like that we're not in the time to worry about keeping the devil out of church the prophet of God said the devil goes to church and so do we think now we can kick the devil out of church no my brother and sister we're not going to kick the devil out of church but I'll tell you what we can do we can get the Holy Ghost in us and there'll be no room for the devil he'll be able to come to church if he wants to but it won't have an impact on you and I it won't control our life it won't be controlling our atmosphere it will no longer be the devil made me do it my brother and sister because you'll be so full amen I tell you I love that little joke I'm sorry but I just seen it the other day again I don't even you know it says you know what happened when the mosquito landed on a holy ghost-filled Christian he flew away singing there's power in the blood yeah my brother and sister now that's a little bit humorous but I'm telling you when you come to that place of that atmosphere it will no longer be the devil the devil the devil the devil you'll be able to say there's power in the blood amen God's in control of this atmosphere God's in control of this vessel I have given complete control to him and as the old joke or whatever says you know some country star said uh uh you know Jesus take the wheel and somebody had quipped a long time ago when that song come out and said what about the clutch the gas and the break yeah got the wheel but you got your foot on the gas Benny wants to go forward you got your foot on the brake there's no devil don't you believe that there's a real devil just as real or you or anybody a real devil and you must recognize him real right it's a recognition is the value if you never see the devil is real if it's just words you heard it preach oh watch out for the devil well if that just becomes so casual you become desensitized to the devil he'll be sitting right there as it were and controlling your life and you won't even know it you must know he's a devil then the same time that you recognize him and know that he's a devil and he's against you then to overcome look at this Saints what we got to do is you know we spend a lot of time can have we can spend a lot of time of dealing of don't don't don't and this and that and whatever and watch out but there Comes A Time you must recognize that the god in you amen not just God but the god in you is greater and mightier than he than he is that's one that's in you has already overcome him oh now I used that parrot earlier I hope you don't mind me using the parrot again now this has to be a personal relationship so please understand the the example I'm giving you but sometimes we should just pair it the moving of the spirit of God young people maybe you'd be saying I've never really felt that I don't know I I've been raised right I've been raised in church I want to serve God but I've never I've never really I just don't know what to do or how to do it well I'll tell you there's an age and that's not like 20 or 30 but there's an age for you just to pair it the moving of the spirit parrot this is why it's important parents that are Godly atmosphere in our home we can't apply the token and this comes and I think probably bites all of us you can't apply the token and invite the devil to dinner that's right applying of the token means the token moves in the devil moves out amen we must go through our books our magazines are this are that whatever it is because you're not going to have two of them dwell peacefully together you say well we have troubles in our home well I'll tell you what you just invite Jesus invite the devil at the same time and see if there isn't trouble amen because you're going to see the devil get kicked from one end of the house to the other you're going to see the devil get thrashed and then you're going to see him thrown out in the driveway and my brother and sister in spite of the rock songs of days gone by we have no Sympathy for the Devil not one drop of Sympathy for the Devil he knew when he started deceiving the Angels what he was getting into no sympathy just as our lord Jesus the prophet lays it out you can search it out very carefully long before he ever went to Golgotha he knew amen just come to another Crossroad Brother David do I turn left it's a cul-de-sac that means I'd have to go out there and come back but I'm telling you my brother and sister the whole story of Ruth fits it so perfectly yes there is one who is closer than I but last he would lose his inheritance the devil already acknowledging I can't redeem you I cannot redeem you I'm not even going to try amen amen I'm just gonna deceive you you'll follow me not as redeemed as deceived the devil's very subtle yeah let me read this again sorry to be redundant then the same time that you recognize him and know that he's a devil and he's against you you know nowhere in here young people please hear me you will find nowhere in the word of God that the devil has a promise to offer you other than damnation sorry for the strong words that's all he's got to offer he can offer popularity that's temporary can offer wealth that's temporary because the minute you take your last breath you're no longer rich I knew I should have broke this up in about 10 parts my oh my okay let's go forward and by his grace you are more than a match for him for the devil There's real overcoming when you recognize you look back and say I'm doing this and I'm doing that then know you you're defeated in other words let me put it in this term what do you mean brother Trevor I come to church every time I can every time that there's you know and and I I read my Bible and I do the prophet Allah says nope nope nope nope you failed to recognize this I'm doing this I'm doing that then no you you're defeated right right so the very best that you can offer you're defeated the very best I can offer I'm defeated reminds me and this is Quite a feat I thought this was actually incredible the lady if I remember correct was like 85 6 7 years old received a lifetime award from the southern baptist conference in her life never missed a church service and how many of you can even come close Saint Peter look at my award come on come on look at this I've been in every church service well I'm going to tell you Saints hopefully this doesn't turn you off but before I really gave my heart to the Lord I fixed a lot of tractors I planted a lot of crops I did a lot of things in church now I just want to be kind and ask you willingly to admit what it is you accomplished now down here we're going to come to what I was mentioning earlier I was stirred by what our sister Andrea had to say see I'm doing this I'm doing that no no you're defeated but there's no condemnation to those which are in Christ Jesus then walk not after the flesh but after the spirit then you realize you've overcome it says no longer this is not a flash issue we have flesh issues yeah yeah the devil will put you in a position that something on the way to church away home from church or whatever it is you'll Foster you'll be upset about things that's that's the part that Satan comes in and anoints that but the thing is my brother and sister I'll just admit it I'll tell you what sister Jerry and I for from about uh let's see what would that be about 10th Avenue down here to about um uh Midland fought on the way to church I guess it was this side of Midland just a little ways if you want to come after church I'll show you the point and it was over nothing you realize it was just the devil just a devil but do you know how you know you're an overcomer when you didn't willfully okay spirit let me escort you into church and I'll walk you right up to the second row and we'll go to church together now if you guys have been following us down the highway this morning you would have said what did I just see did they throw trash out the window no it was just the devil that's what you ought to do Saints he never said you're going to be perfect never make a mistake never have a thought never have a deed never have a this or half of that but he said that you would always come back to the word he said that you would always seek the spirit of Christ and that is a spirit of reconciliation amen now look at this see walk not after the flesh but after the spirit then you realize you've overcome and you know that he is the devil you can't say now this is going to be I need you to pay attention you can't say I got a sickness and the end and I I I I don't believe it as a sickness see this is why how we confess is very important people would be like about ready to drop dead and think of I'm not sick they believe they're standing in what we would consider a Biblical or message position I'll give no part to the devil I won't speak the devil's language but I got this quote for you I got a sickness and I I I don't believe it's a sickness oh yes it's a sickness it seems contrary to some of our thinking right not to acknowledge one thing about what the devil's doing you got cancer don't believe it is a cancer it is a cancer it is a cancer but remember come on Remember come on Saint somebody say it with me remember amen greater is he that is in you than he's in the world you must realize that the Holy Spirit that's in you has already overcome and we think we're being spiritual we think we're being a giant I don't know I don't have nothing wrong with me you're withering away why don't you say yes the doctor says it's a cancer it's a this it's a that but I serve a God I serve a god that is greater than all of these things amen the denial of your circumstance is not overcoming it well might for a moment go oh oh look at that let's acknowledge they've got cancer yes they just acknowledge it but when it comes from your mouth but my Lord that word says I'm already healed the Devil by what yes right I thought I had you convinced that part didn't matter well I'll tell you what there's some churches that it would be convinced already but we're not that one we're one that believes in the saving of the soul and the healing of the body amen we believe in the outpouring of the Holy Ghost we believe in the word coming to life in flesh and walking on the earth once again amen Hallelujah oh you must realize the Holy Spirit that's in you has already overcome this thing and he's in you and you can overcome by him that's exactly sensible I was talking to a man one time he gave me about 10 compliments about how that I was such a sensible down to earth smart and because of all those things he was like that's why you ought to take your church away from the message preach the Bible to them and I told them that's what I do brother no you're preaching this message I said no I'm preaching this Bible we had a lot of conversations until he finally just quit communicating with me which is sad because I kind of actually was enjoying it because you know what it does it forces us out of our little comfort zone that's right oh you know these people believe like I do I just love to fellowship with them and these over here kinda those back there not so much come on you know the reason I really like these people they never challenge me about the message so we all just say we're Believers and it's really good and you know what I don't like about them as they're constantly talking about now did you read and understand what brother brownham said foreign I don't know what you're talking about you need challenged I need challenged it's in the challenge that we dig deeper it's in the challenge that we something Rises up and we say I I need to know amen I want to know Lord show me but if you're never challenged Saints I've told the story here in church about the man that was well on his way to the Olympics I don't remember he ran like the 800 meter and um you know which is basically 800 meter sprint because if you're the guy who slows down you're the guy who loses and he ripped his Achilles tendon everybody said his career is over he went to surgery the doctor said well I did the very best I can do a renowned orthopedic surgeon best I can do but I'd rather doubt you'll ever run again and he kept working at it working at it got better got better got to worry beat almost everybody you might say in a regional context got up to a higher level was beaten and somewhat severely and he kept telling the coach coach you're not doing something right and the coach said I'm doing everything right you're the one that's not doing it right and they would argue and they'd get in a fight and one day he's out there and he runs and he hobbles to a stop the coach comes over and he tears into the coach and the coach just listens patiently and very methodically starts to tell him you're never going to run as an Olympic Athlete again you have no endurance you have no heart you don't have the mind for it you have nothing going for you you are a failure this young man is shaking with anger out there and all the time before Saints when he was in church I mean on the track and he reached that certain little spot he just stopped right there said it's kind of painful I can't go any further than that that's for the prophet I mean that's for others maybe for my pastor I can't do that and the shame of his coach tearing into him caused him to run harder and work harder and harder and harder and harder and he thought I'll get a new coach but no coaches would take him they say what we hear is is you're done and he dug deeper and he fought the devil harder and he resisted more and declared I'm not a quitter I'm an overcomer declared I will outrun context now every Spirit of laodicea and the day he eclipsed the fastest time ran that year in the United States was the day as he come to a halt his coach come out threw his arms around him jumping up and down and said I knew you could do it I knew you could do it I knew you could do and he said no you didn't he says well I just had to do something to get you out of your atmosphere I'm kind of wondering church if any of us from grace are going to actually make a rapture I don't know if we can run far enough and fast enough and overcome enough I don't know I don't think it's going to work like this though is it y'all just looking at me like now now what's wrong with you preacher speak for yourself but sometimes we need a reckoning we need to come face to face are we really running the race are we running in the pack with everyone else some of you are looking downright mean here my yep and you know sometimes things should just be sensible come on everything doesn't have to be deep and spiritual some things can just be sensible like how do you feel after you pray and read your Bible if you say well I feel condemned then you're not running the race correctly because you haven't recognized the devil yet because the devil's going to tell you even in your most victorious day on this Earth is going to tell you you failed he's going to tell you right after you've prayed through that you didn't pray enough he's going to tell you after God's answers your prayers gives you spiritual wisdom to step forward into the calling of your life the devil's going to say I think you're making a mistake you're going to be like that young man that track star ran till it was painful and then stopped some of you forgive me this morning you only run until it becomes painful and you're stopping you want to win the race keep running amen amen amen come on don't just go tell it's painful because the devil will make everything painful come on let me just hurry on here amen you see my brother and sister in every form of warfare there's things that work and things that don't and you know we have to recognize the devil's tactics and I would say to win in this layout to see an age we definitely have to recognize Satan's tactics but the more important is that we recognize and you can find this go in the message search and look it up brother Brown talks about we got to recognize God's tactics I prayed for 10 years for healing maybe you haven't been preparing it correctly brother Brown uses that it's a direct quote tactics of healing amen so we got to come and recognize the tactics of God and sometimes the tactics of God is that we have to give up our ideas and accept his amen now brother Branham says here in this sudden secret going away of the church now that's the way the church ought to be watching for the coming of the Lord all in order already all packed up and ready to go as soon as he comes because it'll be a moment in the twinkling of an eye just trying to time how long it would take your eye to twinkle and that's just how quick the Rapture of the church will take place you know the enemy always used oh I forgot honestly I forgot this quote was it about tactics I was actually thinking of another one you know the enemy always uses the tactics that the Lord uses you know when he seen that God was going to have a righteous church and the things that he was going to do the enemy used that same strategy and he's got a church he's got a people that's very religious and they're just right on the toe as religious people because he knows that Christ Church is the same way so just being religious my brother and sister is not enough we have to recognize as I started the service with amen that there would be those false Apostles that would come in and they came in and they are going to be very devoted very dedicated very on the ball the prophet of God said they might even be more so than the real bride of Christ but my brother and sister it won't do them a bit of good unless they got the Holy Ghost amen a new birth that's right right not an anointing people be anointed in the flesh I'm telling you you talk about anointed you know a man walking down the street average old man looks over and somebody changing a car tire and the car fell over and pinned the man there is crushing him and an average old man went over there and grabbed the car and picked it up while somebody else pulled the man out how could he do that and they'd say we need to take you to the hospital you probably torn ligaments and tendons and this and that they take him to the hospital nothing wrong with them shows the power that's in us that we don't even know is there and I'm telling you when we get face to face with the devil my brother and sister there's so much more power in this bride of Christ than she recognizes that we get back and you know why it is oh I hope this doesn't hurt your feelers but it's because we only run till it hurts we only serve till it hurts we only say Amen until it hurts come on you don't think so look I'm gonna here let me just take my wet towel come on you don't think there's a preacher you don't see that in church you hit on something and that guy that was there a minute ago or that sister you praise the Lord praise the Lord that's why you're supposed to if you can't say Amen at least say ouch we'll know you're still alive let's not be a church that just runs till it hurts let's be a church that's already committed to run the race amen I just read a lovely little deal this took place back in about um oh my I think it might have been the very same year that the Balmer bombed the marathon back east it's a man started that when he got you know they had a point they cut off the race because of what happened and a fireman stopped this man and said sir when he put you in an ambulance and he said I'm doing fine and I said sir when blood is running out of your shoes you're not doing fine then they thought maybe he was crazy because he's shuffling along the Route with blood coming out of his shoes like this guy's deranged and he says oh no no it's been come out of my shoes for a couple miles now but I told myself I was finishing the race what are you going to tell yourself this morning I hope I finish the race if I train enough I surely would finish the race you realize Saints as much as we talk about faith faith also applies itself in the spirit and in the mind and you can sit here this morning and say that doesn't apply to me and in your world it doesn't apply because you told yourself you can sit in church and say I don't believe the message the way he's preaching it and then all good things that would bless just they just go to the Wayside because of what the mind you see I'm closing if the musicians would come you see what's happening my brother and sisters we're not here just to learn the devil's tactics which the prophet of God said reasoning was one of his tactics it's where he got Eve was to reason with the word we're here to learn the Lord's tactics prophet of God speaks of the Lord's tactics God's tactics and healing and deliverance and receiving the Holy Ghost to recognize the leadership of the Holy Spirit you realize how important that is I'm telling you I've been in Services where people were healed and other people walked out of church and said that's probably the worst sermon I've ever heard in my life why one had learned Here I Am Lord Here I Am Lord I've got nothing else to give of myself and another said it was too long it was too convoluted disjointed didn't even make sense and someone else walks out a baptism of the Holy Ghost to recognize the Lord's leading now I know there's a little direct today but I didn't sign up for this job to make you all happy all the time [Music] of the Lord my brother and sister oh I think sometimes we can say well I felt the moving of the spirit but where did it move you then move you closer then move you farther away did it move you to turn your thoughts to something else did it move you to think on Christ what is the moving of the Holy Spirit we need that leadership I hear it all the time you meet up with Believers of this message you talk to them and so many of them want you to know how many years they've followed the message I'd like to know how many years you've been on fire you realize this is an old man's metaphorical thing about serving God he said they say praise the Lord I'm like firewood and I get thrown in the fire I burn hot and I burn bright and this old man says I'm sorry to tell you this actually is the back of the wood shed and this wood has never seen the light of day for 40 years [Music] come on do I need to explain that a little different two years you catch it you'll burn bright if you're in the fire but if you're in the back of the woodshed you ain't doing nothing now firewood doesn't have legs it can't go through itself in the fire but you do you do you do come on we need to recognize the leadership of the Lord I've heard people now this is going to be a little caustic sounding and I'm closing I've heard people spoke it to my face I've been in the presence of it for years say well the Lord spoke to me to do this this and this six months a year five years later they're going on another the Lord told me to do this that's contradictory to this which one's right you either got lied to then or you're getting lied to now or possibly both times come on Saints don't use that as an excuse to justify it I prayed through the Lord spoke me to do it you take it back run it across the arrow funnel there's where it matters across the Earth [Music] Hallelujah let's just stand up because I'm telling you I have got so much I could just go on what I do want to say to you though please don't spend your time focused on the devil focus on the word have a prayer life [Music] have a request life a fleece as it is how many of you have fleeces yeah I would like to encourage each and every one of you if you don't have a fleece you start reading the scripture you pray about it put a fleece before Lord I just listened to a testimony of a youth service where a young man who is the kid who's secretly drinking secretly doing all these things corrupting some of the young people in the church and everybody was just rabid
