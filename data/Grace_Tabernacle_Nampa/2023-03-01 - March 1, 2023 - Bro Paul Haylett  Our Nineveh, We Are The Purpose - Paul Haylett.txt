Jordan to canaan's Fair land and this is like heaven to me amen can we say Amen to that tonight thank you thank you amen how glorious it is my brother and sister to be able just sit stand whatever we might be doing and have that Everlasting Joy bubbling in our soul amen like to welcome tonight our sister clark I believe it was Sister Sophie that spoke to you uh probably there in the store and um so I say God bless you and welcome this evening amen so I want to speak to you tonight on um a continuation of Nineveh of Jonah now Brother David just he sure did a number on my on my thought but I've just decided I'm I've got to preach it anyway amen and so uh we just want to uh remember it's good to see you brother basili amen thought maybe you're still out on the road but it's good to see you in the house of God tonight um let's just stand as we go into the word of God tonight and um amen I I just um you know I love that quotation you know that when Satan comes in and believes he's defeated a son or daughter of God they just rise up and they just press in even harder than before and I thank the Lord for that because some days should be declared Monday and Friday all together mixed up and done but my brother and sister it doesn't matter because we're not living here in the circumstance we're living in the promise of God and let's just turn in the Book of Jonah the third chapter and uh we want to if you go back brother Gideon to the title there I want to make emphasis of that as we look in Nineveh Saints let's not look at just the historical side of what happened there of what was with Jonah but remember when God sends his word there's always a purpose and the purpose is not to build big churches not to build all kinds of Glorious things on earth we are the purpose and so I thank God today that we literally in our generation have had another moving of the Holy Spirit coming down touching lives changing lives and as it is we wouldn't look at it in the way that Nineveh itself responded but we sometimes maybe should to literally come down and say forgive us Lord and and to be as it were that they put on sackcloth and Ashes which was a sign of repentance my brother and sister it was a sign of surrender as a sign of uh being a broken people and uh sometimes today you know if we're not careful we have people go down a dry Sinner and come back out of the water a wet Center and what we want to do is is truly be able to recognize our purpose and to respond to the word of God in the fashion that God would desire us to do so Jonah the third chapter and we will just read uh verses 1 through 10. and the word of the Lord come unto Jonah the second time saying arise go into Nineveh that great City and preach unto it the preaching that I did thee my so God's come back isn't this not a gracious God Jonah ran God said I've chose you Jonah for this job and Saints look at our own lives I certainly can look at my life and my youth and I run and God give me more than two chances and I'm thankful for that arise and go into Nineveh that great City and preach into it the preaching that I bid thee so Jonah Rose and went into Nineveh according to the word of the Lord now Nineveh was an exceeding great city of three days journey and Jonah began to enter into the city a Day's Journey and he cried and said yet 40 days and Nineveh shall be overthrown so the people of Nineveh believed God so they didn't recognize Jonah for Jonah right they realized this was a message that come from God they believed God and proclaimed her fast and put on sackcloth and from the greatest of them even to the least of them for word coming to the king of Nineveh and he arose from his throne and laid his robe from him and covered him with sackcloth and sat in ashes and he caused it to be proclaimed and published through Nineveh by the decree of the king and his Noble saying let neither man nor Beast heard nor flock taste anything let them not feed nor drink water but let man and beasts be covered with sackcloth and cry mightily unto God yea let them turn everyone from his evil way and from the violence that is in their hands imagine if a president of the United States would stand before a nation and make this kind of Declaration my my brother and sister people say it's impossible but Nineveh was a heathen City my we don't even sometimes want to use the word heathen in our churches anymore because it kind of offends people but my brother and sister there's a lot of heathens around and when it's God doing the work and not man that does not offend that registers in the heart I need God amen but then man and Beast be covered with sackcloth and cry mightily unto God yea let them turn everyone from his evil way and from the violence that is in their hands who can tell if God will turn and repent and turn away from his Fierce anger that we perish not and God saw their works that they turned from their evil way and God repented of the evil that he had said that he would do unto them and he did it not Heavenly Father we're asking you this evening just come make The Word Alive to us father just lead us and guide us in this thought Lord that we could express it correctly the way we ask you father just to walk the aisles of our hearts speak to us individually and as a group tonight I pray in the name of Jesus Christ amen it may be seated I think it's very obvious that God has personalized his message to each one of us we would each tell our testimony our story of our life and the things that have brought us to the place that we are led us to a personal relationship with the Lord Jesus Christ and you know there's nothing like receiving a personalized message my brother and sister I know I've made reference through the years of this but there's nothing like going to a banquet or a wedding reception or uh something like that and you sit and you go there and and uh you are seated at the table and you realize it wasn't a random choice that put you there but literally in front of you is something gold embossed or engraved that has your name on that and you realize that this was a very personalized uh uh invitation or message to you and you know it is meant this personalized message of our Lord Jesus Christ was meant to attract our attention and I think we could all lift a hand tonight and say that it did exactly exactly that amen brought us to a place that we realized it wasn't just a Bible talking about people that were Sinners and needing to repent and and be baptized and and uh filled with the Holy Ghost but we saw our name in there and uh we recognize as we read the Bible uh we recognize that that this is a very personalized message that God is giving because we start to read ourselves into the scripture so it's not a generalized thing that some people need to do this but we start to look at this and say I need to do this and that's what moves us amen and you know God had personalized a message for Nineveh it was there my brother and sister God did not recycle pardon me for using this phrase he didn't regurgitate another message from another city another time or another place but God had personalized this message to Nineveh so personal amen he harnessed now I want you to see how God works God did not come down down there and and uh Jonah come and start talking about your doctor and his faults he didn't go into the City and tell him you got all these gods and all these evil things that you worship and you're lost for money and possessions and your pride he didn't come down there he come down and God harnessed their belief amen God harnessed the very thing they looked to and he harnessed that to bring their attention to this and so there it is they have this belief in a fish God and you know from the moment amen that that Jonah is there on the beach now my brother and sister you can go find all kinds of literature that people say this is impossible it's just a story an allegory analogy whatever it might be but my brother and sister I I don't know many many years ago I guess I just come to a place that I'm just ignorant enough to believe every word of this amen I'm not going to stand here and say I I can explain this away or science says or some very well-educated man come and has proven something my brother and sister if the Bible says it I believe it and you know what it has not failed me yet amen I don't believe there's one of us tonight not very many of us here because of sickness and travel and whatnot but there's not one of us can say that this has come short in our life and so it's there the power of the word that God come and says you know what I'm going to catch their attention now it was the attention he didn't come with the fish God Ministry he come of the ministry of Jehovah amen so he didn't have to compromise to get their attention but God used what was there and what they looked to to catch their attention and then the word of God was preached to them and it become real so real a big city amen I don't know how many people were in Nineveh and it really doesn't matter but it calls them now my brother and sister the word doesn't really give us the full picture of each one of these individuals that were there did it stick could we have went back a year later and found them still serving God we don't know but what we do know is that God will shake heaven and Earth for one soul so there it is in Nineveh there were people in Nineveh regardless if some turn back to their ways people want to argue whether they've all converted my brother and sister I don't care it might have been just one soul but God said I'm going to shake Nineveh for one soul and I know how to get the attention of that one Soul or maybe one family whatever it might have been but it's God knew what to do amen so it was there that every part of this journey of of uh Jonah was to bring him now people would say you know Jonah was backslid well my brother and sister he might have kind of had a different deal will if we can get along to it we'll kind of touch on that we wouldn't necessarily agree I think it'd be safe that we could say tonight that if God asked us to do something we ought to just pick up right there and just go do what he asked but God said I don't need a man to worry about Jonah getting away I've already got the whole plan in place for Jonah in fact let's just entertain the fact that that was the fact that God knew Jonah would do that so he just tailored it that way I build this around the nature come on are you with me got to build his program around our human nature now we would be there raised a certain way having certain fears or complexes and God doesn't say I'll have to crush them to die and rebuild them God says no I'll tell you what I'll do I'll let him run so far and then when they're in that moment I'll just come and I will do what I was going to do all along and at that point they'll agree amen that's called permissible will but God's will will be done and I'm thankful for that so it was designed to bring a focus you know my brother and sister when Jonah went there started preaching he wasn't preaching a generic God and I think that's one of the problems we have in the world today that we can preach a generic God and it sounds like we're talking about Jehovah the Lord Jesus Christ but really we're preaching about a generic God one that's very acceptable to almost every class of people in every circumstance of life that they can all say yes I believe what do you believe amen this word of God is a life-changing gospel it is a word that takes us from the Mind reclaims the song says and lifts us on high we're not looking for just people to acknowledge or sign a name to something we're looking for a life changer amen we're looking for something that would do this see it's a powerful enough message my brother and sister to touch the greatest in the kingdom and the least in the kingdom and so this word my brother and sister a powerful message I don't think of the day we're living in people talk about power but do they really understand the power that is given to the Christian amen it is not power to speak Mighty boastful things but it is the power to live a Godly holy ghost-filled life in one of the most wicked worlds it has ever been that power lifts us up out of that my reclaim and guides us to a life that's clean and holy before God oh people want to say power is I prophesied this or I claimed it I claim my Bentley I claim my Mansion I claim this and that my brother and sister none of that gets us in the Kingdom what gets us in the kingdom is the Holy Ghost and character that is built by the word of God Amen so we find many interesting types in this tonight amen we see the gospel as it came to you and I we see the gospel coming from the Jews to the Gentiles and if you have been as we have been recently you'll realize that the Jews still feel very Superior to Christians they feel like that we had him first and yours is just really actually a copycat if you don't think so go listen to what some of these rabbis are preaching even now in the last 90 days in Israel there is no Jesus there is only Jehovah but they miss the fact that Jehovah of the Old Testament is Jesus Christ of the New Testament and they can't see that because it didn't fit their concept but lest not us fall into that absolute of that that we have a concept that it must fit what we need to do is say Lord you are the guide I will follow Lord give me the courage to follow you wherever you would take me Lord um amen you know I won't belabor that but um I've just you know from our trip to Israel I've just been following through on some things and you know it's interesting how they're are so many rabbis listening to around by speak the other day and he said well let me tell it to you straight he's speaking to a good-sized group of people let me tell it to you straight that Mary girl should have been taken out and stoned hmm that's their perspective failing to see that the lamb that was prophesied had come and walked in their midst and they completely failed to see him and the scripture says Their Eyes Were blinded that the word could be opened to you and I and so I look at this and I'm not judging them my brother and sister but realizing the power of the prophecy that they would be blinded so that we could see because here they are today good men righteous men with good reputation and they're saying not Mary should not have been honored she should have been stoned blind blind but the word had to come thank you Lord the word came amen now some people I've heard it said about concerning what happened in Nineveh they called it a Revival but my brother and sister was not a Revival because there was nothing there in the beginning and a Revival is taking back or Reviving to what they had in the beginning so there was nothing so it was not a Revival this was the power of God coming in amongst heathens and absolutely catching their attention and causing them to recognize their position now a powerful move of God have we experienced a powerful move of God my my brother and sister we have seen all kinds of things happen amen we don't glorify we don't want to stop and totally Focus but I tell you you ever watch a broken arm a bent arm come back straight perfectly healthy you have had your attention caught right there God has brought your focus right down and so we see these things now do we run out every day thinking we need to perform that to know God is real and with us no sir I have told you my brother and sister many times I believe that as we look back in our own lives we'll see the Vindication of the word of God because we have been changed Can someone say Amen man amen we are not the creature we once was we have been changed now what does that change does it must change his physical form here on the earth now no my brother and sister God's not redeeming he's not worried about this body he's not investing in flesh he's investing in the soul amen and when you have a heart that was black and God has turned that you recognize the change that the scripture is talking about has taken place and I just want to say thank you tonight thank you Lord for that amen now I just want to keep moving along here did this work do you think that took place in Nineveh suddenly turn everyone in Nineveh into a saint I don't think so the scripture clearly shows us that there's a make-believer an unbeliever and the real believer and so I don't believe God changed the formula just for Nineveh so ultimately if you'd pardon me to say this all of ninama my Nineveh might have had sackcloth and Ashes but some of them never did figure out why and some of them knew why but it was hard isn't it amazing how we can look at this I will agree with individuals they say you know what serving God is hard I agree with him but I don't because a real life-changing event changes that nature it's gone it's done it's finished it's circumstances of life hard can be very hard very very hard but there ought to be something anchored in the soul that says I was called to serve God I was not created and put on the earth and then randomly selected to serve God but from the foundation of the world I was chose to serve God and ultimately the upsets the UPS the Downs the sideways I know I was called to serve God and life can be hard but my brother and sister will look right here and see that the desire that God did we can see the desire for everyone what did what did that happening give Nineveh it gave everyone a time to make their own decision and I believe my brother and sister that the work that God was doing we're not going to dissect that but it was something that was powerful and it gave a people a time to make a decision and and we don't know the decisions that they made nor does it matter because we're looking in history but uh you know what I want to lead up to here is that we shouldn't even judge when God calls us to plant we shouldn't even judge where we're planting if God says speak to that individual pray for that individual invite that person to church it's not our job other than to displant my brother and sister if nothing comes of that that's not our responsibility God just asked us plant amen I go in the spring you know our visitor doesn't know but I'm a farmer and I go in the spring and I don't ask every one of those seeds are you going to grow up to be a good plant I go out there and I plant and I drive and I drive and I drive and I put hundreds actually millions of seeds in the ground in a matter of a few days a few weeks and I am waiting to see but there's something inside of me that says I believe that that seed will grow and when we see men and women Sons and Daughters of God we see the Nineveh of our day God didn't say now go see if they have a seed that will grow he told Jonah go tell them that judgment is coming and let them make the decision what they will do with it but Jonah needed to make that uh decision to present the gospel plant that seed and we're going to touch on something here in a minute then I have to admit I've looked a little bit of commentary on it I've studied in the message you know about this but you look at this my brother and sister and it I'm still perplexed if it's okay to say that don't want to come across like I have an answer for everything because I certainly don't but you know I want to just read Isaiah 15 5 11 first and we'll look at this um Isaiah 55 11 prophecy so shall my word be that goeth forth out of my mouth it shall not return unto me void but it shall accomplish that which I please and it shall prosper in the thing whereto I sent it so we have this promise of Isaiah 55 that is telling us that what God has spoken will not return void has God spoken to our Saints amen I sit here tonight and able to say that even in my old sorry conditions sometimes of Life get a little you know as brother Jewell says wowzy wowzy woo you get in those places it doesn't take away from the promise that God gave us we're sitting here as a Jonah running from God having to take the hard way around but God said I've got somebody in Nineveh that needs to hear the word of the Lord for this hour and then the word comes and God has provided now you look at this um there's some other influences involved here though we'll look at this now because Jonah is not a happy camper in fact see I'm Marvel when I read Jonah because I think I'd be terrified to talk to God like this I think I would be like uh you know Lord can I write it down nope that's two that's two I don't know how to do this but it will go into the fourth chapter starting there in the first verse and uh so here's Nineveh is now had a Revival that went all the way to the king's Palace and all the way to the laborer as it were that lives in the back alley the man no one recognizes no one gives any uh Applause or or credibility to he's just a nothing in the back alley and God reached him and reached the king boy that's a pretty broad spectrum when it's all done now all of Nineveh sackcloth ashes a Revival as it were went through town and and it's there it's happened it's tangible it's on the evening news it's in the newspaper all kinds of Flyers have been published and hung up talking about the supernatural now I'm not going to speak ill of this but we have what's happened in in the University or uh College back East here my brother and sister but yet I want to without being negative I don't mean to but when the word of God Goes Forth it can't return void amen and already things are coming out from underneath the rug and we want it to be genuine we don't want it to be to make the news when suddenly people of the religious World showed up to have their picture taken at that University with those young people was that a promotion of the Gospel or was that a promotion of themselves our whole goal should be promoting Jesus Christ that's what we're called to not to make YouTube Tick Tock a Evening News not to and you know suddenly now my brother and sister the reason I'm not so impressed with this now if any of you have been paying attention you realize that they have had a Revival at that college way back I don't remember what year it was but it's been a long time so this is not a new event taking place at this college but this is a time and this is a season that one corner of the whole thing now has got nothing but big cameras for the news and to film it and document it and do whatever what are they documenting what they should do is be documenting the lives that were changed not the big news event to make it to the evening news and say come so what have they done they've tried to commercialize God it's good for Ratings it's good for program it's good for publicities God don't need their publicity my brother and sister God knows how to advertise let me tell you God knows how to advertise and when he wants you and I to see what he's got to offer he will without a doubt present that to you and I he don't need a billboard he don't need a TV commercial he don't need a documentary he needs someone that's got the life of Jesus Christ the fire of God burning in their soul to walk and to live and to do go to work go to a store go to the gas station be in the neighborhood and that's what God's advertisement is not a billboard but a man or a woman that's got the Holy Ghost there is the power of God on display Hallelujah but Jonah in the fourth chapters now and he is not happy we've just saw the power of God sweep through a great City that took three days to travel from side to side and God is moved and we're not happy I look at that and think Jonas got a problem until I recognized I've behaved the same way before see God move and it didn't move like I should I'm not sure that's real I mean I don't know will they last is that a real deal that child went to the altar but sure looks like their little rebellious well I'll tell you what my brother and sister are here in the next few days brother Ron Peterson's going to have in his church a young man I don't know you probably don't know this story but one time they're in Germany that uh God gave brother Ron a vision in the night of a young man to speak out to and tell him to stand up and say I love the Lord and so brother Ron being obedient to what God laid upon his heart is there in the meeting and he recognizes the face of this young man right there in that meeting and he stops at that time and the Holy Spirit says speak it and he says you stand up and say I love the Lord now this kid had been raised in church and he was a ramble rousing Troublemaker the one that secretly behind all the scenes caused all the good Christian kids to stumble and fall and make mistakes and when he stood up and said I love the Lord kids were snickering because they thought there is no way that guy can do that well he'll be preaching he pastors a church in Germany I can't even pronounce the name of the city but he'll be preaching for brother Ron all these years later the most unlikely God didn't say I'm going to choose these that are the smartest the best looking the well-educated I'm going to choose those that seem that uncommonly nothing to be desired about them because that was the nature of Our Lord and so it's there as they look at this and and Jonas he's angry they've had a Revival I use the word Revival just because that fits our vocabulary and you know so if you're there on verse 2 amen let's go back a little bit get to verse two so here he is Jonah is not very happy praising to the Lord and says I pray thee O Lord was not this my saying when I was yet in my country therefore I fled uh before unto tarshish for I knew that thou art a gracious God merciful and slow to anger of great kindness and repentance thee of the evil now he is actually saying Lord the reason I didn't is you probably could have sent anybody down to Nineveh you could have sent anybody that would have walked down there and said judgment's coming you've got this short period of time and Jonah is like upset that somehow he's there now why my brother and sister will history might show us that he was a very zealous Jew and he wasn't real fond of these Heathen gentiles I mean they're not even chosen but see he didn't realize that while the New Testament wasn't down on the page yet it had already been written people are like well I just read a commentary the other day just stuns me floors me the man's like well I you know the Bible you know I believe the Bible but I believe possibly the Apostle Paul went too far I'm over here thinking the Apostle Paul did not go far enough hmm so people are believing the Bible needs to either be pruned or fertilized to fit their desire their Outlook they can't accept the word for what the word is so he's saying Lord this is what I've already said this is the reason I didn't want to go down there is because these people are all going to get saved wow that's hard but then again go study the New Testament and see the struggles there concerning Jews and gentiles and how the Jewish Apostles some of them wanted the converts to live like Jews follow these Customs fit into this box that we have prepared what they don't realize is God had prepared a whole new box my brother and sister and that box was not to be limited by the thinking and education or whatever of man but it was God's plan and so we'll see how this has come out he's acknowledging that you're a gracious God a merciful god slow to anger a great kindness and repentance of the evil now therefore now Lord take I beseech you me life my life from me for it'd be better for me to die than to live does this even make sense I ask you I'm not the brightest guy on the Block but does this can we even box this up put a ribbon around this and make any sense how it is that God's done a supernatural work and we want to die that'd be the time we should say thank you Lord let life come let life flow let the liberty of the word flow let life flow my brother and sister in our hour that's what the Holy Ghost is for is not to bring a death into it unless it's to sell but it's to bring life into the church it's a life into the body to raise up a people that will stand before the world and stand before God and declare our God is alive and well amen and so he says beseech take my life it's better for me to die than to live then said the Lord I I'd almost wish I could hear this conversation Jonah look that's how well to be angry Jonah have you found some secret prophet as in gain to be angry well why Jonah now look at this do you see an answer from Jonah well we do in a way he just got up and went outside the city didn't even give enough respect to God to give him an answer he just gets up goes outside the city but you know I'm sure glad that God doesn't just throw us away when we do stupid silly things amen I'm not supposed to use the word stupid excuse me we have grandchildren to do things and so he goes out to the east side of the city and makes a booth and he sat down under it in the shadow until he might see what would become of this city now just forgive me here you know how animated I am sometimes imagine now here's a little shade he sits down and he's like I'm just waiting for this to fall apart well you know it had to be that way otherwise he would have been excited at nineveh's response to the preaching of the word so he is sitting there now in this shade I'm waiting for this to come apart at the seams I tell you if that's the attitude we have towards God's word we better find an altar right now because our God cannot fail and if he can fail what promise and at what date will it fail we couldn't trust nothing we could never we could never my brother and sister just go out and live life large amen and testify and knowing that at any moment God's going to fail we're going to feel led to speak to somebody about God washing them wider than snow and they say I want to I want to I want that I desire that and then we would be on eggshells will it happen or not can it happen or not uh you know God's God's freed this one from an addiction but what if God won't come and they're sincere from the heart and God won't come we we would never we we would become a people afraid to testify afraid to pray even for our own needs in our own lives and our families much less the assembly and those around us so what's happened here Satan has literally come and anointed not say that he got Jonah but he's anointed that cloud that cloud of doubt and fear is hovering over Jonah what he needs is a word from the Lord and so it's there and he comes comes to this place makes him a booth sits down in the shadow just to take a wait and see I remember one time South America you have people that have very serious needs a lot of young people a lot of drugs and I remember there was a lovely young lady there and she said I need Deliverance trying to encourage her and the response that kept coming was I don't think it's for me no God will deliver you of this situation and of this addiction I I just don't know if it's for me my brother and sister One Promise of God we ought to be all over that we might look like we're selfish all over it that's my promise amen devil get out of the way that's my promise it's in the word and I'm a Son of God a daughter of God that's my promise I don't care if you're still addicted a year later it's still your promise amen but we don't have to set for Satan's answer so the Lord asked him is it well to be angry he goes sits down there makes the booth sits under it and the Lord is interesting how he can prove things in our lives have you ever told the Lord no I can honestly tell you a time when the Lord called me to start ministering I told him not a chance after a while sitting outside the city in my booth there's a gourd rose up now where'd that seed come from God don't need us to go poking seeds in the ground he'll grow anything he wants to grow anywhere he wants to grow anytime he wants to grow it but here is this this Gore over Jonah the shadow over his head to deliver him from his grief and Jonah was exceeding glad of this gourd now I don't want to just stretch this out too long tonight and keep you too long but my brother and sister imagine here is a City full of thousands and tens of thousands of souls that have repented for God and Jonah's angry over that but here's a gourd growing and it makes him happy I as I was telling you earlier have no answer for this I have no understanding of this Soul saved angry a gourd growing makes me happy but God was proving a point to Jonah because then God raised up now you know me being a farmer I don't want to sound too to um unfriendly to the environment but I'll tell you in years past having grown many kinds of crops if you go out in a bean crop and you see one cutworm one not a dozen not a hundred not a thousand one cutworm you go over get back in your pickup you drive to the shop you get in the sprayer you drive it to the shop you pour all kinds of toxic things in there add this and add that and you drive out there and you cutworms are gone and God says my answer to Jonah's predicament is to send this little worm and it's going to come and it's going to spite the gourd imagine Jonah lays his head he's happy my look how my gourd has grown today um wakes up in the morning foreign and then on top of that God said I'm going to proved my point with you enough Jonah and he causes a hot wind to come and Buffet him and the word tells us I'm just going to kind of break this down real quick the word tells us that fiery trials are good for us the hot wind blowing on us the fiery trial you say but Lord I've served you Faithfully why because there's still a little Dross he's burning out of us and he knew exactly get this saint he knew exactly what it would take to get the dross out of Jonah he didn't throw Jonah away my brother and sisters Jonah had an attitude problem but God didn't take Jonah and throw Jonah away God schooled Jonah in the way that God wanted Jonah to be able to understand and respond and I say thank you Lord for that because otherwise we'd all got tossed away a long time ago but God comes that's a hot Wind come and so it is here that it come and he should be and and Jonah just doesn't even know what to do because he's he's not happy and verse 10 says the said the Lord thou had pity on the gourd for the witch that thou Hast not labored nor made us it grow which come up in a night and perished in a night and now he's speaking to them and should I not I'm going to change this a little bit Saints just and you can follow me should I not come to the Gentiles should I not come to people who don't know the right and left hands apart should I not come to people that never heard the name of Jesus Christ should I not come to the weak and the weary should I not come to the beggarly and should I not come to the richest of the rich and he's speaking he said and should I not spare Nineveh the great City six score thousand purple cannot discern between their right hand their left come on even our little ones even our little ones are getting old enough now to no right and left so imagine the nature of the people in Nineveh none of them is going to sit down with their strongs and crudence and the Bible and figure this out not one of them had a clue but God said I saw you before paraphrasing I saw you before you were birthed I saw you when you were still bloody in swaddling clothes I saw you when you could do nothing for yourself and I loved you oh how great is our God How Great Is Our God my brother and sister I didn't preach this quite the way I've been preaching it to myself but I'm telling you when I look at this I realize the absolute grace of God Amen that has come to our life amen it's there well you know there's so many things uh you know I think part of Jonah might have had because I just take this from a human nature I think Jonah might have kind of got a little attitude saints that he was there with this little bit of an attitude trying to justify why he didn't obey God in the beginning so if it turns out all these people just in a few days get over and go right back to their life then it would justify my my attitude and my Disobedience but you see well look at this in such a fashion sometimes my brother and sister that we can justify our Disobedience to the word of God and we say well I didn't hear a voice like he did yes we have we read the word and the word is his voice amen it's not some put together deal it's God speaking amen and in this I say Lord help us that we will not try to justify uh our own uh our own disobedience amen and they that are sons of God are led by the spirit of God then when the human element goes out and the spirit of God fills that vacancy what is that dying to ourselves where you empty yourself amen there will be when the church and its power of the resurrection of the Lord Jesus will walk in his steps in his power in his thoughts in his being in his moving now we talk about the moving of the Holy Spirit we talked about it on the phone a little bit today the moving of the Holy Spirit my brother and sister is an emotion but it's not it's much deeper it'll be the deepest emotion man will ever witness in his life it won't be just a stirring of a little something on the flesh or something that catches our sympathies and we react to this is when the soul is stirred Just Like An Earthquake it is shaken and it is brought to a place that we say Lord I need you I need you and I believe that's the kind of Revival that swept through Nineveh that many people were there I need God in my life didn't even know there was a god amen in his being it is moving you see what I mean then your thoughts will become words and words will become material that's when the church is in its power amen not just us talking about it I was sharing this with a friend here the other day and and I was bearing my heart I'll bear it to you I'm slowly and steadily getting tired of talking about it now some people say whoa Brother Paul's talking no no I want to see it materialized I don't want to just talk about it why don't we just talk about God will come one day and move in people's lives and straighten them up and give them faith and strength and we'll be able to lay hands and we'll oh my brother and sister I think we need to move Beyond talking about this and see it being materialized in our midst oh we can speak in tongues my brother and sister there's a guy I remember he shared a story with me once he said there was a man in our church that spoke in tongues all the time and if you did business with him he'd rip you off every time did those two go together no my brother and sister one didn't prove the other but the one did prove he didn't have the other amen so there's what we want we want the life then your thoughts will become words and words will become material and that's when the church is in its power and I believe it's on its Road I do believe that amen when the church will be so wrapped up in Christ the Holy Spirit mankind so away from themselves that they don't see themselves they don't have no uh but to serve no I I think that word probably was desire in there but no desire but to serve God Amen and so he said and their thoughts move on they refuse the things of the world now you know it's kind of funny because we as a Holiness Church and belief in our Bible is our standard my brother and sister I like to look around I study I I kind of do this and we see even just almost secular churches doesn't seem like that sounds like they go together right Church secular but it's true there's many of that they talk about prosperities and talk about you know if God gives you a brand new Mercedes that's a sign of God's favor my brother and sister that might be your downfall and it got nothing to do with entering the kingdom of God that's nothing with you to come in God's present the car you drive or what kind of clothes or values that you have none of that matters I'd rather be the poorest man on the planet and have Jesus Christ than live in a mansion and have him absent from my life and so you look at that and so it's coming a time there's going to be a people that don't care about the things of this world now we do need to eat we need a place to live we're humans we need a habitation but we need God more than that they just move in the spirit they live in the spirit move in the spirit walk in the spirit so fulfill the law of Christ then the love of Christ in the human heart moving in the Holy Ghost that great wonderful church will go forth with power and deity because deity will be revealed in human beings by the Holy Spirit bringing to pass the thought of their mind now my brother and sister the scripture says that our mind would be the mind of Christ amen so it's not talking about whatever we was thinking about a great scheme our mind won't be on a great scheme to make money or a great scheme to do this or that our mind will be on Christ amen First Corinthians the second chapter you can take that home as homework first Corinthians 2 11 16 amen we don't want to have the spirit of the I might as well it's just a few verses for one man knoweth the things of a man save the spirit of man which is in him even so the things of God knoweth no man but the spirit of God now we have received not the spirit of the world can someone say amen amen but the spirit which is of god that we might know the things that are freely given to us of God that's why real Christians are just an oddity to this world today my brother and sister it's not about how big the building is and how fine the choir is and all of these other factors that the world is doing I think I shared with you guys the postcard that I got sent here the other day did I share that how that they're they're doing they having this seminar how to fill your church up at Easter my brother and sister I don't want numbers I want real Christians I want God to do the filling I want God to do the calling amen and let God come in here and let our light as Sons and Daughters of God shine that they would see there is a difference amen we're not here you know this whole brochure was about get more people in your church your offerings will be bigger your tithe will be bigger but I'll tell you what they'll be the less of the spirit of God when it's just man manipulating everything to fill up a building I'll tell you what God didn't go into the Philip the building business he said were two or three are gathered in my name I'll be there also and I'll tell you what even though about half of us are gone tonight my brother and sister God didn't say well there wasn't enough there for me to visit tonight God said there's two or three amen and when you figure that out it is not a a a humanistic thinking it is a word of God coming forth and manifesting itself we have received not the spirit of the world but the spirit which is of god that we might know the things that are freely given to us can we say that together freely given to us of God which things also we speak not in The Words which man's Wisdom teaches but which the Holy Ghost teacheth comparing spiritual things with spiritual but the natural man receiveth not the things of the spirit of God for the foolishness to them you know what happens when you get a church clear full of people by an agenda about half of them want about 15 or 20 minutes and they want to be told that they're going to heaven and they want to be dismissed no asking and I'm going to use the word demanding but I don't mean that in a nicolaitan form just give us what we want and we'll be happy I think I'll leave that one alone it's because the natural man can't receive the things of the spirit of God their foolishness to him neither can he know them right didn't the scripture say we know it did I'm just putting it that way may he blind the eyes just as Israel was blinded God would blind the eyes of the carnal-minded man identifying as a Christian they think that if they just go to church life don't have to change you know I've named it and I shouldn't never have done that but I cannot block out the image of the summer time people pulling up to church their big boat behind their pickup and they get out this is a true story I'm not making this up they get out the man's in one of those tank tops it's really low and cut out and baggy shorts with flip-flops and the rest is family is all dressed in that similar fashion going to church so no respect for the house of God imagine if this let's just humor me for a moment do we have a moment you can humor me imagine now we just pulled them out of time and we took them back and took him to the temple and they come to walk behind the veil done over finished but somehow we have this idea that it's all changed God God's modern now God's modern you don't mind I've joked it's it's been here it's happened in this building I'm not going to enforce it but I will mention it here hopefully you find some humor in it I think even the flip-flops shouldn't make it in the door at church and I'm not you wear a pair of flip-flops I'm not going to preach on you I might you know get one of those big hands on the sign that's got the finger and I might be holding it up you know but I won't say a word but where's our respect for the house of God it's withered away like the gourd did and then we wonder why Christians are just as angry as the world why Christians are just as messed up as the world because we have not found the right Avenue to approach God we took one of convenience we took one that made us feel good um I hear the ice cracking I want to be my brother and sister as verse 15 is that he the spiritual judges all things yet he himself is judging no man I want to be that guy why not that no one can judge me but that I've already judged my life before Christ amen I don't need to stand a judgment because I've already come before God and had my life examined by the word of God and let the Holy Spirit deal with me to lift a hand and say Lord the discern me Lord cleanse me Lord give me a clean heart as David did and to be able to look at that and say this is what I want amen I'll skip over a couple things here but one thing I want to touch on amen sister vika if you'll come verse 10 is pretty straightforward then said the Lord has had pity on the gourd you notice he had no pity on Nineveh he had no pity on them people but he had pity on a gourd I I I can't comprehend that yeah I can't comprehend that but I'll tell you I've witnessed it I've witnessed it I have literally witnessed young children coming to an altar and a deacon coming along after a while and kind of giving them the boot and telling them you've been here long enough go back to your seat did they know what the conversation was oh let me drive it home a little more personal y'all not looking spiritual enough tonight would that be fair no but we'd pick up a stray dog take it home and feed it and we have not one bit of pity or compassion on the body of Christ Lord help us let us not be the net Jonah of that condition let us have compassion let us have encouragement let us lift up those around us someone has a need my brother and sister don't look on down on them oh I wonder what's wrong you know I I come across the deal here recently and actually smote me right to the very depths of my heart part of a conversation and in that conversation something was mentioned about a struggle that a certain family was having and a man raised his voice and said I wonder what their secret sin is the tires falling off at your car meaning or Center that struggle with raising children mean that God's not present in our home the list could go on Saints let us have compassion let us have pity let us not get a hard Spirit let's not rather that Nineveh would have been struck with fire let's have a tender heart you see God's brought us Saints to our own Nineveh he came to our city come to our town he come to our family come to our doorstep and said judgment's coming and we responded and it stopped didn't it the days the weeks the months the years have passed and we're still serving God and I have to believe with my heart there were those in Nineveh that was the years went on were still there worshiping worshiping Jehovah saying thank you Lord for sending the word of the hour thank you Lord for sending a message to me called me out of the darkness of Nineveh into a glorious light to serve you and recognizing as the word goes my brother and sister that it was not just promised to them but it was promised to their children and their children and children and those that are far off what a glorious what a glorious blessing that we have been given Hallelujah Hallelujah let's just stand sing a song or two before we're dismissed tonight amen I hope this all made sense oh Lord help us amen Open the Eyes 806 brother Gideon Hallelujah Open the Eyes of My Heart cause of my heart I want to see you oh I want to see you Open the Eyes of My Heart Lord Open the Eyes of My Heart I want to see you oh I want to see you to see you high and live d shining in the light of your glory I'll pour out your power and love as we sing Holy Holy Holy holy holy holy holy holy holy I want to see you let's sing verse one again Open the Eyes

and love as we sing holy holy holy holy oh holy holy holy holy holy holy [Music] I want to see you Hallelujah number 250 brother Gideon amen I just say Amen when I just look at the words of this song amen he's been my provider he's been my healer I've shared many things with your church there's a lot of them I never Sheridan they're just equally impressed upon my soul of the things that my God has done for me times of need he's always been present he has come the Midnight Hour and he's spoken to me and I've watched it come to pass in the next day do I make anything great out of that no it was just God dealing with me on a certain issue of my life and he made it so personal made it personal enough it didn't even have to come from someone else God himself come down laid it right upon our heart I say that's personal amen I say it's good when someone anointed of God comes and tells you the Lord has revealed this to me and it's the truth but how much more personal when God himself comes down and says there's a little something in your life I want taken out or I want you to see something you've never saw before look up your redemptions drawing nigh and my brother and sister this is the God we serve it's so personalized to us we have hearts desires and sometimes they're not always deep spiritual things can you say Amen to that sometimes they're just things that are very close to your life and you would come and say Lord this is important to me I'll share this one it might sound silly and forgive me if I sound silly but when we were in Africa we were driving through the deal there and I thought Lord it would be so awesome I've saw the pictures for years I think it would be so awesome to see a leopard draped over the tree like they do just totally relaxed the tail hanging down their head lulled to the side Lord I'd love to see that I never mentioned it to my wife I never mentioned brother Gideon and we're driving along and lo and behold here is a leopard sister Jerry's like leopard and we look up in the tree and we drive up close and here's this great big leopard and he's just laying there his head his tongue was sticking out I like that you know somebody's relaxed when their tongue is sticking out and his head's load to the side and he's just draped over this tree and we sat there and looked at that and I thought thank you Lord you care even of the littlest things that might sound silly that one would ask God about to see a leopard in that form but I tell you I knew God was there with us I knew it's just everything that had taken place in the conversations and everything that was there and not to be emotional but it means that much more to me now of the passing of our brother Gideon that God knew and I'm telling you my brother and sister he is our provider oh my profile you are more just thank him Saints and enough [Music] oh for me Jehovah oh you're my healer and by your stripes I am set free I say thank you Lord [Music] with me
