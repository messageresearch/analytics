[30:29] it's a

[31:25] reation finally had to have a little
[31:27] Fellowship today it's been quite a while
[31:31] and U he gets to the end of it and said
[31:34] you are preaching tonight right so here
[31:37] we are and uh appreciate the the open
[31:42] door God bless you for that and each one
[31:44] of you that came out tonight we love you
[31:46] and and I hope you can hear me until he
[31:48] gets back with the battery
[31:52] operator we uh it's just never amazes me
[31:56] that song that you're just saying
[31:58] actually there's parts of that that go
[32:00] along very much with what I'm feeling
[32:02] the Lord would like to bring tonight and
[32:05] uh how that God can take the simplest
[32:09] things
[32:10] sometimes and things that we don't even
[32:12] realize or think about and turn that
[32:15] into something that's So Glorious and
[32:18] yet sometimes it seems so small and yet
[32:21] that's literally the the mystery of God
[32:25] revealed I was thinking here recently in
[32:28] Reading in uh
[32:32] Ephesians thank
[32:34] you reading in Ephesians where uh it
[32:39] said that the Mysteries would be uh
[32:42] revealed by by way of the Apostles and
[32:45] Prophets and such and we think a lot of
[32:47] times in this day and age because of the
[32:49] tremendous amount of Revelation that has
[32:52] been sent to us we tend to think of it
[32:55] as big things and high things but to me
[32:58] one of the greatest
[33:00] Revelations that I've seen from the pro
[33:03] prophet's message is those two little
[33:05] dots those little
[33:08] colons because just understanding the
[33:11] concept that anytime you see that little
[33:13] colon there's some there's a stop and a
[33:17] time frame it might be 10 seconds it
[33:19] might be 2,000 years but the fact that
[33:23] it's a stop and a time frame what a
[33:26] mystery to me that's what a tremendous M
[33:30] CU I talk to other people and other
[33:32] ministers from different Realms and such
[33:34] and when I mention things like that to
[33:36] them they're just astounded they just go
[33:39] what I was talking to a a woman recently
[33:44] that kind of given her a testimony thing
[33:46] and I mentioned a couple of scriptures I
[33:48] I said well there's a break there and
[33:51] that break gives you okay this is how
[33:54] the scripture starts but then this is
[33:56] how manifests and then this is how it
[33:59] fulfills and she was just there's what
[34:03] what a what a mystery and yet it's two
[34:06] little
[34:07] dots but what a
[34:10] tremendous to us as Believers to realize
[34:13] that then you go back and you start
[34:15] reading your scriptures brother brandham
[34:17] said after the seals it's a new book
[34:19] well it really is when you start
[34:22] understanding that oh that's not just
[34:26] all one conglomeration no it's in three
[34:29] pieces of how God brings it and then how
[34:32] he manifests it and so I I love the Lord
[34:36] and I appreciate what he's done and and
[34:38] what he's doing even right now and
[34:43] uh let's just go ahead let's stand for a
[34:46] moment as we uh read from his
[34:50] word and let's approach the author here
[34:53] for just a
[34:55] moment gracious Heavenly
[34:59] Father it is indeed a privilege to be
[35:01] here tonight and to realize that Lord
[35:04] this is the time this is the age this is
[35:06] the people Lord in which sin is blotted
[35:10] out in other words it never exists
[35:14] anymore in the presence of
[35:16] God and so we thank you for that tonight
[35:19] and realizing that position in US of you
[35:23] in US is what brings that to pass Lord
[35:26] and our hearts and lives and anoint your
[35:29] words tonight father that people might
[35:32] become as brother venam re revealed to
[35:36] us the ABCs always believe Christ and
[35:39] again always becoming Christ as we give
[35:42] you the service we thank you and Praise
[35:44] You In jesus' name
[35:47] amen we'll read first uh from acts the
[35:51] 7th
[35:53] chapter
[35:55] and uh
[36:00] I realized there is a very good message
[36:03] that was preached called you know what
[36:06] house will you build me and this is not
[36:09] to add to or detract from that in in
[36:12] anyway but just to take another look at
[36:17] building a little bit and that's what
[36:19] this uh scripture refers
[36:23] to we'll start with uh first
[36:27] 48 acts 7 and verse
[36:31] 48 said how be it the most high dwelleth
[36:34] not in temples made with hands as saeth
[36:37] the prophet Heaven is my Throne Earth is
[36:40] my foot stol what house will ye build me
[36:43] sayeth the Lord or what is the place of
[36:45] my rest hath not my hand made all these
[36:48] things and then uh in Luke the 17th
[36:55] chapter
[36:59] as
[37:03] we turn to here it's 17 and verse
[37:08] 20 and this is uh and when he was
[37:11] demanded of this of the Pharisees when
[37:14] the kingdom of God should come he
[37:16] answered them and said the kingdom of
[37:18] God cometh not with
[37:21] observation neither shall they say low
[37:24] here or low there for behold the kingdom
[37:26] of of God is within
[37:30] you and then one last place from Luke
[37:33] and that's Luke
[37:36] 12 and verse 31 and
[37:42] 32 uh make sure I got the right place
[37:48] here for all these things do Nations the
[37:51] world seek after and your father knoweth
[37:53] that ye have need of these things but
[37:56] rather seek ye the kingdom of God and
[37:58] all these things shall be added unto
[38:00] you uh that's not the it's right after
[38:04] that oh it's in verse 32 I'm sorry fear
[38:07] not little flock for it is your father's
[38:10] good pleasure to give you the
[38:13] kingdom gracious Heavenly Father we
[38:15] thank
[38:17] you add your blessing we pray to your
[38:19] word in Jesus Christ's name amen be
[38:22] seated
[38:24] please and you know I you know that I've
[38:29] often I think I've done it here a couple
[38:30] times talked about
[38:32] moving things around in a lot of these
[38:35] words and how that God is always moving
[38:39] and always hiding himself in
[38:42] Simplicity and and how that you know to
[38:45] we can move this it becomes
[38:48] uh transitive which simply means to move
[38:52] from one place to another and we've
[38:54] talked about that and you can see it and
[38:56] and and what it's moving in this case is
[38:58] water inside of a
[39:00] vessel and and we take it and we thank
[39:04] you for the
[39:08] water and we just moved a portion of
[39:11] this water that's in the vessel into my
[39:14] body you could say well where did it go
[39:16] well it's part of me and I'm part of it
[39:19] but there's another part that's totally
[39:23] unseen we can't see it we you know I
[39:27] mean you can taste the water itself you
[39:29] can feel the water yourself it's you
[39:31] know it's kind of cold in the bottle and
[39:34] and all those different things but the
[39:37] Unseen thing that's really the most
[39:40] important part of the whole as it were
[39:42] demonstration is the fact that in that
[39:45] water is
[39:47] life as human beings we have to have
[39:50] water to be alive in fact I can't
[39:52] remember what percentage it is but it's
[39:54] a very large percentage of these bodies
[39:56] are actually water now that little
[39:59] portion I just drank is now part of this
[40:03] body but it's not just the water that
[40:06] water provides
[40:08] life and the word of God is that way
[40:12] even as the water in fact Jesus uh said
[40:15] to the woman of the well you know if you
[40:17] knew who you were talking to you'd ask
[40:19] me for a drink and you'd never thirst
[40:21] again and she said I want that water
[40:23] well we understand that the word of God
[40:26] is like water in that it provides life
[40:29] to the
[40:30] believer we can't always see it directly
[40:35] and yet we do as we see the
[40:38] manifestation that it brings into our
[40:40] lives when uh you know at in my younger
[40:45] days rock and roll bumed so to speak and
[40:49] uh dabbled with some of the many of
[40:52] other things of the world that go along
[40:53] with that rock and roll scene and stuff
[40:55] but when Jesus Jesus Christ came into
[40:58] me it didn't show right away right I was
[41:03] still playing in a rock band for a few
[41:05] weeks after that maybe a month I don't
[41:07] remember exactly how long it was my hair
[41:10] was you know about to about where the
[41:12] beard is now and the other thing all
[41:15] those other things that go with it and
[41:18] yet
[41:19] when I surrendered my heart to
[41:23] Christ all I knew was he came
[41:26] and when people would ask me because I'd
[41:28] tell them I'm Different something's
[41:30] different about me and I remember even
[41:33] when I asked the Lord when I got up
[41:36] after committing my life to Christ and
[41:39] waking up you know wet with the tears
[41:41] and stuff and I looked at my body and I
[41:43] I said man I'm looking at it going what
[41:45] happened I'm not even the same person
[41:48] and there was a still Small Voice said
[41:50] born
[41:52] again
[41:54] now and yet it didn't
[41:56] manifest fully right away but something
[42:00] happened the life of Jesus Christ came
[42:03] into me and when you we surrender
[42:08] ourselves personally to him well just
[42:11] surrender Lord Jesus he said whosoever
[42:14] calleth on the name of the Lord shall be
[42:16] saved he doesn't say you're all they're
[42:18] all bride he doesn't say there he just
[42:21] said they shall be saved that's his word
[42:25] and there is a life behind that word
[42:29] that we call eternal life now whatever
[42:34] manifestation it takes or how it some
[42:37] people have given their hearts to Christ
[42:40] and they're in the grave
[42:42] tonight and you say well that doesn't
[42:44] look very
[42:46] Lively but the fact that there there is
[42:49] a life in the word that was transmitted
[42:53] into them if they ever one time
[42:55] surrendered their their life to Jesus
[42:57] Christ no matter how backslid they got
[42:59] or whatever circumstances came if there
[43:02] was a full surrender just Jesus Christ
[43:06] take me it was enough to get the thief
[43:07] of the Cross there the the one the one
[43:10] Thief he said Lord remember me that's
[43:13] all he said and he but it was the right
[43:16] words the right
[43:18] time for
[43:20] him because we know that we were in his
[43:24] thoughts before the world began
[43:26] according to the book of Ephesians and
[43:29] being in those thoughts when that man
[43:31] said remember me he was actually
[43:34] reaching out into
[43:37] [Music]
[43:38] eternity and causing Jesus as it were to
[43:42] look into eternity and see that man was
[43:45] meant to be
[43:48] there that's a life behind the word the
[43:53] man's life was in pitiful condition
[43:57] pitiful and he even he even admitted it
[44:00] he
[44:01] said I deserve this but you don't
[44:05] right and the Bible says repent and be
[44:08] baptized in the name of Jesus
[44:11] Christ was that his form of repentance
[44:14] just I deserve this but you don't by
[44:17] recognizing that that sacrifice and he
[44:20] called him
[44:22] Lord and when he did that the life that
[44:26] was being manifested in that sacrifice
[44:29] suddenly moved from that sacrifice
[44:31] through
[44:33] words through the words of that
[44:35] sacrifice Into the Heart of that man and
[44:38] you know we've heard the story of when
[44:40] he gets to Heaven you know all these
[44:41] other people may be giving their
[44:43] testimonies and they're saying who are
[44:44] you and how did you get here and he goes
[44:46] I don't know I was just just hanging
[44:48] there and here I
[44:49] am and that was his testimony he just
[44:53] recognized God but the life behind
[44:55] behind the word and so we read that
[44:57] scripture there
[44:59] in in Acts and he says what house will
[45:02] you build me and how that he said I
[45:05] created all of it you know how let's go
[45:09] back and read it and as we think about
[45:13] building a house and it it struck me
[45:15] today in our conversation brother Paul
[45:17] about how that you know we look at
[45:19] different kinds of preaching and we look
[45:21] at church splits and all the stuff that
[45:24] happens with people
[45:26] and how people some people go this way
[45:28] and some people will go that way and uh
[45:32] there's divisions there's troubles and
[45:34] of course the we hear from the word of
[45:37] God it says there shouldn't this
[45:38] shouldn't be named among you that
[45:41] there's divisions and those kind of
[45:43] things and yet sometimes there has to be
[45:46] and that's maybe part of the Paradox
[45:48] because uh there was division with you
[45:52] know Paul and Silas and there was
[45:55] division with uh some of the other
[45:58] disciples when even when Peter went down
[46:00] to the
[46:01] Gentiles when he went back all the Jews
[46:03] were really getting on Peter's case and
[46:06] he makes special emphasis look the Lord
[46:08] told me to do this I had a vision I you
[46:11] know he's
[46:12] really having to defend his position for
[46:15] doing that but it was the life of God
[46:18] that sent him there because now it's
[46:22] going to manifest in a new form to
[46:25] Gentiles who you know brother brandom
[46:27] said we're just packing a club on our
[46:29] back we weren't really even looking for
[46:30] the Messiah and yet the life behind the
[46:35] word had to be manifested I was uh
[46:40] listening I want to say it was to uh
[46:43] God's provided place of worship one of
[46:45] them I know he preached it more than
[46:46] once but uh in that
[46:49] tape uh there's a Doctrine out there in
[46:52] the message that they uh I call it kind
[46:55] kind of a tunist because they say that
[46:57] Jesus Christ can't be God because he
[47:00] died and God can't die but you know I
[47:02] listen to that uh particular
[47:05] message and he said that God hid
[47:09] himself in
[47:11] Death from the
[47:15] Jews and we know that he went to hell
[47:18] and preached to the Sinners so he was
[47:20] very much alive while he was there but
[47:24] he was hiding from the Jews why was he
[47:26] hiding from the
[47:28] Jews because we had to come in so he hid
[47:33] himself behind that sealed tomb so that
[47:39] he could manifest himself for you and I
[47:45] so his death was
[47:48] life because that life was being
[47:52] transmitted from as it were the bottle
[47:56] to fulfill the life of God concerning
[48:00] Jesus
[48:01] Christ so this thing that we call
[48:05] Salvation is about life and it's about
[48:08] the life that we live and I make tons of
[48:11] mistakes and sometimes I even feel like
[48:14] banging my head against the wall and say
[48:15] why why did I do that why am I doing
[48:18] this and yet then sometimes God can turn
[48:21] it completely
[48:23] around and I go wow that's what that was
[48:26] all about and it's because God is trying
[48:29] to manifest or to show a form of life
[48:34] and so we see that he said what house
[48:36] are are me have these fancy I went to
[48:39] the eye doctor today he said wow you're
[48:41] still way ahead of every everybody else
[48:43] with those new little lenses in there
[48:45] but this has you know to make the little
[48:48] letters bigger in the bottom here so he
[48:50] said uh in 7 and
[48:54] 48 but the question came up there uh how
[48:59] be it the most high dwelleth not in
[49:00] temples made with hands as saith the
[49:02] prophet so the prophet who is a
[49:07] mouthpiece of God has just made a
[49:10] statement that uh he dwelleth not in
[49:15] temples made with
[49:16] hands and that was a prophetic word and
[49:19] behind that word there is a life to be
[49:23] manifested well we know that
[49:26] Solomon in fact in verse 47 it says
[49:28] Solomon built him a temple or built him
[49:30] a house then he says Heaven is my Throne
[49:33] the Earth is my foot stol what house
[49:35] will you build me sayeth the Lord or
[49:37] what place is the place of my rest and
[49:41] you see those little dots just scattered
[49:44] through there and how we begin to as we
[49:47] look at that he says what house will you
[49:49] be you know the Lord says what house
[49:52] will you build me and then there's a
[49:55] stop or
[49:57] rest and then he said what is the place
[49:59] of my rest so there's a break in the
[50:03] building of the house and when the rest
[50:06] enters that house even as it was with
[50:09] you know
[50:10] David did a lot of things to
[50:13] prepare the building of the temple but
[50:16] he was not allowed to lay his hands on
[50:18] it not even
[50:19] once because you know God said David
[50:22] you're a bloody man and I J just can't
[50:25] do it it has to be a temple of peace and
[50:28] so it all fell back onto Solomon his son
[50:31] to provide as it were the Working Hands
[50:36] to build that Temple and how that the
[50:39] life of God was moving through the words
[50:42] because God had told David you know the
[50:44] fact that you wanted to do this for me I
[50:47] didn't never ask for it but the fact
[50:49] that you even wanted to do this for me
[50:52] is uh you know it's a great thing and he
[50:55] said but you can't do it but your son
[50:57] can and remember behind all of those
[51:00] words there is a life that's going to
[51:03] manifest some portion of God and as we
[51:07] think that uh David representing the as
[51:10] it were the kingship of God in his life
[51:14] because when it started there with
[51:16] Samuel uh the word of the Lord God's
[51:19] word the life behind the word that comes
[51:22] out and goes to Samuel that word comes
[51:25] to that Prophet who becomes the
[51:26] mouthpiece and God says go anoint me a
[51:29] king and as we begin to view the life of
[51:32] David over and over and over we see the
[51:38] actions uh being produced in the life of
[51:41] David that point us directly to Jesus
[51:44] Christ as our King he's a Shepherd who's
[51:47] our Shepherd Jesus Christ he slew the
[51:51] giant who slays our Giants Jesus Christ
[51:55] he cut the head off the giant what was
[51:57] the prophecy concerning Judah your hand
[52:00] will be in the neck of the
[52:02] enemies go who who cuts the head off the
[52:05] enemy for us right Jesus Christ yes and
[52:08] see so the life of
[52:10] God came and began to build us a
[52:14] picture of as God being King and it
[52:18] comes all the way to the end and yet he
[52:20] said but David you can't build the house
[52:24] your son has has to do
[52:26] it God himself as king could not build
[52:29] the house but his son Jesus Christ
[52:33] builds the
[52:35] house and his son and again I use this
[52:38] scripture a lot because it's meant so
[52:40] much to me Genesis 49 when it says you
[52:43] know he's the he's the 49 and N I think
[52:47] it is or eight and it said that he's
[52:49] he's the prey the prey that goes up and
[52:52] then then the next portion of that
[52:53] scripture is he's the rest rest and then
[52:56] after the rest he said who will Rouse
[52:58] him up or who will bring him on the
[53:00] scene and
[53:02] so the sun builds the
[53:06] temple Jesus Christ came as the temple
[53:10] of God in Shepherd form just like David
[53:15] when the anointing came on him he was
[53:17] already a Shepherd but now he was I'll
[53:20] say a special Shepherd because he had
[53:23] the life of God now
[53:25] protruding from that Shepherd's
[53:28] position and with that in mind and and
[53:32] all down through there he keeps showing
[53:35] the life of God the life of God but that
[53:39] life of God that kingship of God could
[53:43] not pro provide the temple for him to
[53:47] live in it took his son for God so loved
[53:51] the world he gave his only begotten son
[53:54] and the son builds the house now we talk
[53:58] about a house and we think often
[54:01] times even you know considering that
[54:04] this is called a house of the Lord well
[54:07] somebody had to lay a foundation and and
[54:09] after the foundation they got all the
[54:12] plans out and they did all the stuff for
[54:14] the flooring and the and all the parts
[54:16] to this
[54:18] position but even as a church house even
[54:22] as a house of the Lord without life
[54:25] being in it it's pointless right you are
[54:30] the life of God that was manifested to
[54:34] be in this building
[54:36] tonight thank you Lord the fact that the
[54:39] building's here it's wonderful you he
[54:42] have done a fantastic job in my estimate
[54:46] every time I come here I just stand
[54:48] amazed and think man how did they do
[54:50] this and but it's because there was life
[54:54] here
[54:55] there were people that were manifesting
[54:58] what the word of God says to
[55:02] do get a place to worship get a place
[55:05] where and it's not the
[55:07] place the place is the Life of Christ
[55:11] that's in
[55:12] you and how that without that it's vain
[55:17] worship and that's why as ministers it's
[55:22] we must stay with the word we must stay
[55:25] with the life of God manifesting through
[55:29] us and in us to other people this
[55:32] eternal thing we call eternal life it's
[55:34] not just about me it's not just about
[55:38] you there's a purpose to it and that
[55:41] purpose I wanted to uh let's read Psalms
[55:46] 51 maybe it's a little more like
[55:49] teaching tonight I don't know
[55:52] exactly and I know you're familiar with
[55:54] this because we sing this as a song and
[55:58] it's
[56:02] uh the the song You Know created me a
[56:05] clean heart oh
[56:08] God and we I I sung this song many times
[56:12] in fact we go sometimes on the mission
[56:14] fields and and there'll be a certain
[56:16] song that for whatever reason God picks
[56:19] that song as like a theme sometime for a
[56:22] whole trip and one time when we went to
[56:25] Nicaragua without anybody saying
[56:28] anything about it this particular song
[56:31] created me a clean heart and and renew a
[56:33] right spirit in me almost everywhere we
[56:36] went without saying anything about it
[56:38] they sang this song almost every
[56:44] church I can't do that I didn't even ask
[56:47] it I just about the fourth or fifth
[56:49] place we went to I went that's pretty
[56:52] amazing because then you begin to rec
[56:54] recognize it's the spirit of God moving
[56:57] and it's moving on those people but
[56:59] there's a
[57:00] purpose when we sing this song and when
[57:03] we ask this as as a as a blessing to us
[57:07] or as a uh prayer request I often tell
[57:10] people sing this as a prayer sing this
[57:13] is in communion or in communication with
[57:17] the Jesus Christ or The God that's in
[57:19] you we read from Luke the kingdom of God
[57:22] is where it's within you
[57:25] he said it doesn't come by
[57:27] observation you observed me drink the W
[57:30] drink from this bottle but what you
[57:33] couldn't observe is the life that it's
[57:35] manifesting in this body it's
[57:38] unobservable and so it is with the word
[57:41] of God it's unobservable to the outside
[57:45] five senses and even the things of the
[57:48] spirit but it
[57:50] manifests by what it provides to other
[57:55] people he says uh create in me a clean
[57:59] heart oh God renew a right spirit in me
[58:02] and uh Within Me cast me not away from
[58:05] thy presence take not thy Holy Spirit
[58:07] from me restore unto me the joy of thy
[58:09] salvation and hold me with thy free
[58:12] spirit now that's all wonderful those
[58:15] are blessings for us those are parts of
[58:18] the request that's we're asking for the
[58:20] life of God the presence of God to be
[58:24] here to be here we're asking for those
[58:27] things and we're asking uh when we sing
[58:31] this create in me a clean heart we're
[58:33] asking for all the pieces to the
[58:37] building and believing that because it's
[58:40] the word of God every word of God has
[58:43] potential of
[58:46] creation and as these become creative
[58:49] words and when we pray this prayer uh I
[58:52] just heard brother bham saying again
[58:54] again recently that God loves to hear
[58:57] his word spoken back to him right so
[59:01] when we sing this we are singing the
[59:04] life of God back to God yes and when we
[59:09] uh sing it back to him uh deep calleth
[59:14] to the Deep with the noise of thy wat
[59:16] spouts and when that life of God has
[59:20] come to us and begins to reverberate
[59:24] back back to
[59:25] God then we begin to see things
[59:30] happen I begin to see things in my life
[59:33] I begin to see things how be it ever so
[59:36] small sometimes but it can be something
[59:40] that I call it lifechanging I suppose
[59:44] but here he gives us what the reason for
[59:46] this song is really or this these words
[59:49] is about and it is a Psalm and he said
[59:52] uh and it pulled me with with thy free
[59:55] spirit and in verse 13 it says then will
[59:58] I teach transgressors thy
[1:00:02] ways what's the point if you're just
[1:00:05] doing it for self- edification there's
[1:00:08] no point right the point between the
[1:00:12] life that was transmitted through the
[1:00:16] psalmist David into us that we sing back
[1:00:21] to him the point of it is to teach
[1:00:25] transgressors the
[1:00:27] way and that doesn't have to take a
[1:00:29] three-hour teaching message it can be
[1:00:32] just the simplest thing that you say or
[1:00:35] do I remember one time I was going
[1:00:37] through a terrible trial it seemed like
[1:00:40] and a sister who hadn't seen us for a
[1:00:42] while and she just came up and grabbed
[1:00:43] my hand and says God bless you David had
[1:00:46] a great big smile on her face and it
[1:00:48] just it's like the trial just
[1:00:52] went you don't have to be be a preacher
[1:00:55] you don't have to
[1:00:56] be uh you know a three-hour message or
[1:01:00] whatever it is just show The Life of
[1:01:04] Christ let that life live in us then
[1:01:09] will you teach transgressors the way and
[1:01:11] sinners will be converted to thee and
[1:01:14] there's those dots again and you go wow
[1:01:18] Sinners will be
[1:01:20] converted
[1:01:22] well without going into you know deep
[1:01:25] thoughts about this if you want to read
[1:01:28] again about a
[1:01:29] conversion it's in Acts 3:19 we'll go
[1:01:32] ahead and read it because it gives a
[1:01:35] particular time frame of
[1:01:40] conversion and that's you know we read
[1:01:43] there in the about the house and he said
[1:01:45] where is the rest going to
[1:01:48] be and then here in three and I believe
[1:01:52] it's
[1:01:53] 19 he two won
[1:01:58] work you love him
[1:02:01] amen when he's giving the uh Peter's
[1:02:06] given the dissertation here and he says
[1:02:10] repent therefore and be converted that
[1:02:12] your sins may be blotted out and there
[1:02:16] he gives a specific time frame when the
[1:02:19] times of refreshing shall come from the
[1:02:22] presence of the Lord and he shall send
[1:02:25] Jesus Christ which was before preached
[1:02:27] unto you
[1:02:30] now at the time that he saying
[1:02:34] this Jesus Christ as we think of it had
[1:02:37] not been preached to
[1:02:39] them there these scribes and Pharisees
[1:02:43] here and this is you know just after uh
[1:02:46] the day of Pentecost and stuff within a
[1:02:49] certain time frame there and he's saying
[1:02:52] that you know that Jesus Jesus Christ
[1:02:54] was preached to you and there are
[1:02:56] probably some of them sitting there
[1:02:58] thinking what are you talking about we
[1:02:59] never even heard the name of Jesus
[1:03:00] Christ but there's another scripture and
[1:03:03] I forgot to write it write it down for
[1:03:05] you but it says it's in First Peter and
[1:03:08] it said what that the time that the
[1:03:10] prophets would realize that the things
[1:03:13] that they said back there were pointing
[1:03:17] to Jesus Christ even though they didn't
[1:03:19] know it do you think Isaiah necessarily
[1:03:23] knew
[1:03:25] what he was Tau maybe he saw it in a
[1:03:26] vision and was relating the vision when
[1:03:29] he said you know he'll be wounded for
[1:03:31] our transgressions and with our Stripes
[1:03:33] we'll you know we're healed and stuff
[1:03:35] and maybe he had some understanding of
[1:03:37] that but he didn't know when it was
[1:03:39] going to happen right and he didn't know
[1:03:41] who it was going to happen to but the
[1:03:44] life had to speak it because it's going
[1:03:47] to move those words the creative power
[1:03:50] of God was going to come into those
[1:03:52] words and when it goes into those comes
[1:03:56] out from that mouth the prophets are the
[1:03:58] mouthpiece of God and when it comes out
[1:04:00] from that prophet's mouth it begins to
[1:04:02] go into eternity and form all of the
[1:04:07] necessary
[1:04:09] ingredients to bring that to
[1:04:12] pass do you
[1:04:14] understand once it was
[1:04:17] spoken the life of God went behind it
[1:04:21] and began to put certain people in
[1:04:23] certain Bloodlines and certain people
[1:04:26] doing this and they had the and they
[1:04:29] went into captivity and all those
[1:04:31] different things all of that had to do
[1:04:35] with well after they went down and they
[1:04:39] came back and we I forget if it's Ezra
[1:04:43] or Nehemiah one of those and their
[1:04:45] tribes are all mixed up everything's a
[1:04:47] mess and because now it's going to take
[1:04:50] a
[1:04:51] savior to save them they can't cannot
[1:04:54] even possibly do it by the law because
[1:04:57] everything's mixed up think about the
[1:05:00] message marriage and divorce brother
[1:05:03] benam said stay as you are it's too
[1:05:04] messed up there's no way you can go back
[1:05:07] and change it just don't do it again
[1:05:11] yeah but it takes the power of a
[1:05:16] savior and it now it comes up and all
[1:05:20] that was the power of God or the life of
[1:05:23] God setting the stage so that when Jesus
[1:05:27] Christ came on the scene and he could
[1:05:30] see
[1:05:31] himself in that position even Jesus
[1:05:34] Christ the man it says he learned
[1:05:36] obedience by the things that he suffered
[1:05:39] he didn't just have an easy life and
[1:05:41] everything was hey Grand no he suffered
[1:05:45] certain things even in his natural life
[1:05:48] before he even went to Calvary Calvary
[1:05:52] was an obedience to the things that he
[1:05:55] had learned by the things that he
[1:05:58] suffered and he learned obedience even
[1:06:01] and when he spoke certain things it was
[1:06:03] the life of
[1:06:05] God manifesting in him that he could
[1:06:09] turn around and find himself identify
[1:06:12] himself in the scriptures with the life
[1:06:15] of God Amen when he saw and it you know
[1:06:19] it came there and said the scribes and
[1:06:20] Pharisees demanded of him when is the
[1:06:23] kingdom he didn't answer when it was he
[1:06:25] told them where it was right he said the
[1:06:28] kingdom of God is within you and it
[1:06:31] comes without
[1:06:32] observation you can't even see because
[1:06:35] it's a
[1:06:36] life it's a life that is manifested or
[1:06:41] imparted to us through the life of God
[1:06:44] through the building of the Temple of
[1:06:46] the
[1:06:47] son not God and his great Jehovah over
[1:06:51] us as the
[1:06:53] kingship but the temple was built by the
[1:06:56] Sun but even when the temple was
[1:06:58] finished what had to
[1:07:00] happen it wasn't until the sun turns and
[1:07:05] he says he built a scaffold and he gets
[1:07:07] on the scaffold and begins to pray and
[1:07:11] implore for God to in in part of the
[1:07:15] prayer he said you know if any man even
[1:07:16] look towards this
[1:07:18] Temple God hear their
[1:07:21] prayer and so as Solomon is doing this
[1:07:25] and you know that said the the the power
[1:07:28] of God came down so strong in a cloud it
[1:07:31] said the other ministers they couldn't
[1:07:33] even
[1:07:34] minister they said it was too much God
[1:07:38] came down the presence of God came down
[1:07:42] to fill the
[1:07:45] temple it was completed according to
[1:07:48] plans but it still took the life of God
[1:07:52] to fulfill it and we know that for the
[1:07:55] most part I suppose you know there's
[1:07:57] different problems in the me what we
[1:07:59] call the message of the hour you know
[1:08:01] this church had this split and this one
[1:08:03] did this and these guys went that way
[1:08:05] and people ask me well why is that and
[1:08:08] what and well it's the life of God
[1:08:12] and each part of the the body has a
[1:08:15] different function that it
[1:08:17] does my fingers you know you see me play
[1:08:20] the piano here but not the guitar much
[1:08:22] anymore because these fingers can't do
[1:08:24] it after years of running
[1:08:27] chainsaws it's up here but it's not down
[1:08:30] here and it's kind of the same way with
[1:08:34] God we God is building a temple the life
[1:08:39] of God came into us at the beginning of
[1:08:42] our Salvation I'll call it salvation
[1:08:44] experience and that experience begins to
[1:08:48] manifest
[1:08:50] itself and we
[1:08:52] think uh
[1:08:55] about the building of the
[1:08:57] temple and how that you know they put
[1:09:01] all the all the pieces together and they
[1:09:04] built that Temple but uh when you go
[1:09:07] back to the original one that was in the
[1:09:10] the tent and stuff the way that one was
[1:09:13] built they started by building the
[1:09:15] inside
[1:09:16] first because they had to make the
[1:09:19] garments and they had to uh make the eum
[1:09:22] and Thum and they had to to do all those
[1:09:24] things and the second temple was built
[1:09:28] from the outside and then it was filled
[1:09:32] inside and I remember I believe it was
[1:09:34] that brother gishan Solomon a few years
[1:09:37] back uh when he talked about you know
[1:09:40] cuz people ask well how are the Jews
[1:09:42] ever going to build a temple and he said
[1:09:44] we're already building it and when he
[1:09:47] said we're building it from the
[1:09:49] inside they already have all the stuff
[1:09:51] to put in it when the Temple's put
[1:09:53] together together they've already got it
[1:09:55] and I thought they're doing it right
[1:09:57] this time because you have to have an
[1:10:01] experience with Jesus Christ you have to
[1:10:04] that is the basis you must be born again
[1:10:07] it's the simplest thing but without a
[1:10:09] new
[1:10:10] birth you're building a nice building
[1:10:13] but there's no life there until the life
[1:10:16] comes in and that life has a purpose
[1:10:19] it's so that the
[1:10:22] uh you can teach Sinners or
[1:10:25] transgressors the way and sinners shall
[1:10:28] come to be
[1:10:30] converted and we can look at that of
[1:10:32] course as Jews Gentiles there's lots of
[1:10:35] different types and shadows we can go
[1:10:36] there with but that conversion he said
[1:10:40] there that repent and be converted and
[1:10:44] then he gave us a certain time we'll go
[1:10:46] back to that uh there's a certain time
[1:10:50] frame in which that conversion comes
[1:10:53] forth
[1:10:54] to where sin is completely blotted out
[1:10:58] another scripture where it says at the
[1:11:00] time of refreshing it's completely
[1:11:02] blotted
[1:11:04] out
[1:11:05] my praise the Lord I get so used to
[1:11:08] looking all this stuff up on my phone I
[1:11:11] and plus this Bible's kind of falling
[1:11:13] apart I just bought a new one I haven't
[1:11:15] had our chance to even get into it act
[1:11:18] three
[1:11:22] uh
[1:11:27] okay repent ye therefore and be
[1:11:29] converted that your sins may be blotted
[1:11:31] out and the time frame he gives is the
[1:11:34] times of refreshing shall come from the
[1:11:36] presence of the Lord where does it come
[1:11:38] from the presence of the Lord and it's
[1:11:42] at a certain time called the time of
[1:11:45] restitution or when everything is
[1:11:48] restored to its natural or original form
[1:11:54] there is a time frame we've had all
[1:11:56] these seven Church ages that the spirit
[1:11:59] of God was moving the life of God was in
[1:12:02] it all the way from the first you know
[1:12:04] that Spirit of the lion that came out
[1:12:06] and prophesied all the things that are
[1:12:08] in this book about the end
[1:12:10] time are they
[1:12:12] happening absolutely read second Timothy
[1:12:16] read uh Romans and how they you know
[1:12:19] woman with woman and man with all those
[1:12:21] things and we see it happening because
[1:12:24] the life of
[1:12:25] God set those things into position for a
[1:12:29] reason he did it because the times of
[1:12:33] the presence of the Lord are here not
[1:12:36] just on the outside but on the inside
[1:12:40] because he's manifesting the kingdom of
[1:12:43] God within
[1:12:44] us and that's there for a reason so that
[1:12:47] people can see your life and want to
[1:12:52] change actually really want to change
[1:12:56] and to see something
[1:12:59] that you know we just sitting on the
[1:13:01] airplane yesterday coming down here uh a
[1:13:04] little lady I don't know where she goes
[1:13:06] to church but I didn't even get to talk
[1:13:08] to her very much but before we got off
[1:13:10] the plane because the other guy that was
[1:13:11] sitting right next to me we were talking
[1:13:14] back and forth a little bit about the
[1:13:16] Lord and she heard just enough that she
[1:13:18] saw me hand him a
[1:13:20] book and she kind of looked at me and go
[1:13:23] you want one too and she goes
[1:13:26] yeah because she heard just enough and
[1:13:29] she only heard maybe 5 minutes worth but
[1:13:31] it was enough that it gave her the
[1:13:33] desire I want
[1:13:34] more and that's that's part of that's
[1:13:37] what we're here for that's what you're
[1:13:39] doing this with your lives because the
[1:13:42] power of
[1:13:43] God is moving in this time of
[1:13:47] restitution as he is restoring us to our
[1:13:51] fullness our natural position of Eternal
[1:13:55] creatures in Jesus Christ we talk about
[1:13:58] Rapture and I know there's things out
[1:14:01] there and you know brother brother bham
[1:14:04] said you know there won't be a lot of
[1:14:06] people in that Rapture and
[1:14:09] yet in another way there will because
[1:14:12] the resurrected Saints are going to be
[1:14:14] part of it too and there's seven Church
[1:14:17] Ages full of them that's right but it's
[1:14:21] all in what brings and on the scene is
[1:14:24] the presence of the Lord not just God
[1:14:28] above us but God in us that's the rest
[1:14:33] where he said back there with the in in
[1:14:37] chapter 7 he said where's the place of
[1:14:40] my
[1:14:42] rest how be it Heaven is my Throne Earth
[1:14:45] is my foot tool what house will you
[1:14:47] build me and what is the place of my
[1:14:50] rest he's building a house
[1:14:54] he's building a house in each and every
[1:14:56] life here
[1:14:59] tonight but then he asks the question
[1:15:01] where's my rest well we know that the
[1:15:04] rest is the Holy Ghost you go Isaiah 28
[1:15:08] for stammering lips in another tongue
[1:15:10] will I speak to my people and that for
[1:15:14] this is my rest some heard some didn't
[1:15:17] hear didn't want to hear but God's rest
[1:15:21] is in this building place of what we
[1:15:25] call the word of God of
[1:15:27] moving the words and the things that are
[1:15:31] in this book into our personal
[1:15:34] experience moving those words out of the
[1:15:37] bottle as it
[1:15:39] were and not just into our
[1:15:45] mouths but swallowing
[1:15:48] it remember the scripture in Revelations
[1:15:51] where he said go and eat the book he
[1:15:53] didn't just go go chew on it and if it's
[1:15:55] too hard spit it out no eat it right yes
[1:16:00] and sometimes it's bitter in the
[1:16:02] stomach sometimes it's hard when
[1:16:05] we have certain persecutions and things
[1:16:08] like that but here Jesus even when he
[1:16:10] gave us that scripture about the kingdom
[1:16:12] of God is within you they were demanding
[1:16:14] of him can you imagine that he's just
[1:16:17] you
[1:16:18] know he's just a guy that God is using
[1:16:22] if you look at it in a natural sense and
[1:16:24] here the Great and Mighty priests are
[1:16:26] demanding tell us tell us tell us he
[1:16:29] said
[1:16:30] hey he doesn't even answer them what
[1:16:33] they ask for but he let his life show
[1:16:37] what it really was and with the power of
[1:16:40] God and what this restitution this time
[1:16:42] we're in this time of restitution we are
[1:16:45] in this time of another place it says
[1:16:48] the dispensation of the fullness of
[1:16:50] times we have come to time in its
[1:16:54] fullness we have come to where a prophet
[1:16:58] of God called an angel on the scene that
[1:17:01] said time shall be no
[1:17:05] longer time for the
[1:17:09] believer is approaching its
[1:17:12] end because we are going into the
[1:17:15] receiving or the
[1:17:17] restitution of the
[1:17:19] fullness of God which takes us back into
[1:17:22] etern ET ity to which there's no time
[1:17:25] the world will go right on in time they
[1:17:27] got to you
[1:17:29] know they're going to have a tribulation
[1:17:32] and they're going to have all kinds of
[1:17:33] other stuff but for the Believers the
[1:17:36] fullness or the full restitution and the
[1:17:39] dispensation is not uh in that place if
[1:17:43] you look it up it's not it's a time
[1:17:45] frame very Loosely but more importantly
[1:17:50] it's dispensa or giving
[1:17:53] to those each one there what they have
[1:17:56] coming it's
[1:17:58] dispensing like
[1:18:00] you you go to the doctor's office or
[1:18:02] whatever and they dispense the drugs or
[1:18:05] you go to the wherever it is and they
[1:18:08] dispense things they give you your
[1:18:10] portion happened to be in uh Honduras
[1:18:13] and went to a wedding that uh the daddy
[1:18:17] is
[1:18:18] a very wealthy to man owns some of those
[1:18:23] Big Oil freighter and stuff and they
[1:18:25] said he spent uh in our money roughly
[1:18:30] $200,000 for this wedding
[1:18:34] well he has the money that even
[1:18:37] dispensing everyone with a meal of steak
[1:18:40] and rack of lamb and those things I'm
[1:18:43] going wow this is some
[1:18:45] wedding and but he was
[1:18:49] dispensing actually as a portion of his
[1:18:51] wealth to about 450 people in a
[1:18:55] beautiful beautiful arrangement banquet
[1:18:58] and all those things and at the time of
[1:19:01] the dispensation God begins
[1:19:04] dispensing your
[1:19:06] portion my portion right he's given us
[1:19:11] oh but sometimes we can he said you
[1:19:14] don't have because you don't ask for
[1:19:16] it and I'm bad with some people say well
[1:19:21] if you need something ask me and
[1:19:23] I usually don't I ask God first
[1:19:26] occasionally I I I do when brother Stan
[1:19:29] was here last summer and we had the
[1:19:31] broken thing on the fifth wheel the
[1:19:34] thing that rolls
[1:19:35] out Stan said can I do anything for you
[1:19:38] and I said do you know anything about
[1:19:39] how to fix
[1:19:40] awnings fortunately he did he goes yeah
[1:19:43] I fixed two or three of
[1:19:45] those so sometimes it never hurts to ask
[1:19:49] but to
[1:19:50] remember that every time we come to the
[1:19:53] scripture even when we come to church
[1:19:55] it's not about me it's not about you
[1:19:58] individually there's more there you're
[1:19:59] coming here not to just receive of
[1:20:02] oursel because we've already received it
[1:20:06] it's already part of your life that
[1:20:08] kingdom of God if you have received
[1:20:09] Jesus Christ it's in you and it's not in
[1:20:13] you just so you can feel happy all the
[1:20:15] time right it's in you so as that
[1:20:18] scripture said so that transgressors can
[1:20:21] see that life and be hungry was talking
[1:20:25] to Paul and and you know I saw a lot of
[1:20:28] when we first came to what we call the
[1:20:30] message I saw a lot of negative gospel
[1:20:33] you know uh and they just pound on it
[1:20:36] and pound on it certain things and
[1:20:38] certain doctrines and stuff and I I said
[1:20:40] at some point I got to where it's like
[1:20:43] it's not doing any good for me to you
[1:20:46] know walk down the street and say hey
[1:20:48] lady you going
[1:20:49] know you look like a harlot because you
[1:20:52] cut C your hair that does no good but I
[1:20:56] was telling Paul and I've done this
[1:20:58] several times and I happen to think of
[1:20:59] another one after we left Paul of a
[1:21:02] girl obviously not what we would call a
[1:21:05] Believer but she had hair down just
[1:21:06] about to her
[1:21:08] knees and it did it looked beautiful and
[1:21:11] and as I walked by her I think it was in
[1:21:13] the grocery store uh I said why don't
[1:21:17] how you don't cut your hair and she goes
[1:21:19] no I I I want it to be like this and I
[1:21:22] said well the Bible says It's Your Glory
[1:21:25] don't cut it and I said it makes you
[1:21:27] look glorious and I just started to walk
[1:21:29] off and she goes I mean she started
[1:21:32] crying she goes thank you for telling me
[1:21:34] that she goes I never wanted to cut it
[1:21:37] and she goes just thank you thank
[1:21:40] you you got to start
[1:21:44] somewhere and to think that you know it
[1:21:48] was that important for her to hear
[1:21:51] that it's a simp simple thing you can do
[1:21:55] it you don't have to be a preacher if
[1:21:57] you see something or something or
[1:21:59] someone does something for you uh I was
[1:22:02] thinking
[1:22:04] here uh I don't remember if it was I
[1:22:07] think it was at a little restaurant or
[1:22:08] maybe it was one of the restaurants in
[1:22:10] the airport I don't remember exactly
[1:22:12] where it
[1:22:13] was but I went to pay for something and
[1:22:16] I didn't have the right of money and I
[1:22:17] was oh man okay so I'm going to get out
[1:22:20] you know I had a larger bill or
[1:22:22] something and the lady goes no don't
[1:22:23] don't do that don't do that she goes I
[1:22:26] have a little jar hidden behind the
[1:22:28] computer there she goes I want to pay
[1:22:30] for it for
[1:22:32] you how often do you see that
[1:22:35] nowadays I went really and she goes yeah
[1:22:38] yeah don't don't I don't want to mess
[1:22:40] with
[1:22:41] your and as I walked away I just said
[1:22:44] God bless that woman for her desire to
[1:22:48] serve someone else with her life that's
[1:22:51] what being a Christian is really about
[1:22:54] that's what this water gives
[1:22:56] freely of its life gives freely I didn't
[1:23:01] have to okay water look man I'm going to
[1:23:04] take a drink and I'm expecting you you
[1:23:06] hear me it's Merry Christmas and don't
[1:23:09] forget about it no you just drink it and
[1:23:14] when you drink it the life comes with
[1:23:18] it and this gospel and this praying and
[1:23:22] and this song and you know in in it
[1:23:26] comes from the presence of God and in
[1:23:28] the psalm it was you know take don't
[1:23:31] take that presence away from me let that
[1:23:33] life that comes from that presence when
[1:23:36] Solomon prayed when that life
[1:23:40] came they couldn't talk about it but
[1:23:44] they became a part of it and when the
[1:23:47] life comes you may not have to talk
[1:23:49] about it you may not God bless you
[1:23:51] Sister sua just noticed I noticed
[1:23:54] earlier but I haven't seen her for a
[1:23:56] long time I love her
[1:23:58] smile it means something to me and every
[1:24:02] one of you have a life that it's not and
[1:24:07] I know you've heard the statement
[1:24:08] brother brandom said eternal life is
[1:24:10] living for what for
[1:24:12] yourself no it's for living for somebody
[1:24:15] else and it can be so simple it can be
[1:24:18] just as simple as those two little
[1:24:21] dots
[1:24:22] to where a whole dispensation can open
[1:24:25] up in somebody's life or even in my life
[1:24:28] or your life simply by doing something
[1:24:32] for somebody else it can actually begin
[1:24:36] to dispens or to give God to someone
[1:24:44] else I remember took a few years before
[1:24:47] I ever actually LED somebody to Jesus
[1:24:50] Christ partly I guess
[1:24:53] because well bottom line I was probably
[1:24:56] afraid I I thought always had to be done
[1:24:58] in a church with a preacher it doesn't
[1:25:02] right I remember praying with a man on a
[1:25:06] forest fire everybody said the guy was
[1:25:09] crazy he was actually he was literally
[1:25:13] crazy he had a chemical problem I mean
[1:25:15] they have you know the ad HDs and all
[1:25:17] that stuff but this guy had an
[1:25:18] adrenaline problem that everybody on the
[1:25:21] cruise said don't ever make him mad
[1:25:24] because they said a guy came out he was
[1:25:27] late for work and this guy came after
[1:25:29] him cuz he owed him a little bit of
[1:25:30] money and he said I don't have time I'll
[1:25:32] get you your money but I don't have time
[1:25:34] right now I'm late for work and the guy
[1:25:36] said no I want it right now and he said
[1:25:39] they they watched him pick this man up
[1:25:41] and throw him all the way over a car
[1:25:44] they said don't make him
[1:25:46] mad because he was
[1:25:48] crazy and yet we were just the two two
[1:25:52] of us were working this one big section
[1:25:54] on a fire and it was a Sunday
[1:25:56] morning and we and I stopped and I was
[1:25:59] just thinking about the Lord praying a
[1:26:01] little bit he came over and said what
[1:26:03] are you thinking about and I started
[1:26:06] talking to him and just telling him some
[1:26:08] things about Jesus Christ friend it was
[1:26:10] one of the strongest anointings I have
[1:26:13] felt in my life for that what people
[1:26:16] called a crazy
[1:26:18] man just tell somebody about Jesus
[1:26:20] Christ and better yet let that life
[1:26:24] live through you in something you say or
[1:26:28] something you do something you do for
[1:26:30] somebody else and not doing it as a
[1:26:33] Works program but doing it because the
[1:26:36] love of God lives in us
[1:26:40] well faith is the substance of things
[1:26:43] hoped for the evidence of Things Not
[1:26:45] Seen and as we begin to learn to let God
[1:26:50] use us to dis pensate or to give of his
[1:26:55] gifts of his
[1:26:57] life then that becomes an inexhaustable
[1:27:01] Fountain and that life will grow more
[1:27:04] and more and because I like to think of
[1:27:07] it I remember brother Sergeant one time
[1:27:10] we were talking before he passed away
[1:27:13] and uh he's the first man that ever said
[1:27:15] hey that's uh you know that's your
[1:27:18] Pulpit every other week he said you're
[1:27:21] gifted just get up there and I was like
[1:27:25] man really at that point in my life I
[1:27:27] might have preached three or four times
[1:27:30] and so I told him one time not too long
[1:27:33] before he passed away I knew he was
[1:27:36] concerned we get concerned especially
[1:27:38] with age the youngsters aren't getting
[1:27:41] any younger and as we we get concerned
[1:27:46] you know has my life really
[1:27:48] been what you know worthy of the Gospel
[1:27:51] of Jesus Christ have I really met and
[1:27:55] fulfilled all of the things that God
[1:27:58] wanted to do for me and if I look at
[1:28:00] myself and I have to say no I I made a
[1:28:03] lot of mistakes and I missed God in
[1:28:06] different
[1:28:07] areas but the fullness behind it if the
[1:28:12] Life of Christ has been fully manifested
[1:28:16] or before we leave this planet as we
[1:28:20] think of it then I'm not failed because
[1:28:23] it's all about Jesus Christ and if even
[1:28:27] one sinner comes to Christ because of
[1:28:30] your life brother ROM said that's 10,000
[1:28:33] worlds yeah how much value is
[1:28:36] that I can't even imagine it another
[1:28:39] place he had a million worlds because
[1:28:44] that life becomes Eternal because your
[1:28:47] life was a
[1:28:49] dispensation at a particular time when
[1:28:52] and sin is blotted
[1:28:54] out the example and I I know we used it
[1:28:57] maybe last time brother random said if
[1:28:59] we put all of our sin in that eye
[1:29:01] dropper and dropped it into that bucket
[1:29:04] or barrel of bleach he said that bleach
[1:29:07] has the power to
[1:29:10] remove that all the stuff that's in that
[1:29:15] Dr ink dropper in one place he says as
[1:29:19] though it never existed not even God
[1:29:22] will remember our God who remembers
[1:29:25] everything will not remember something
[1:29:28] that never existed right because that he
[1:29:31] said he created it all and if it becomes
[1:29:34] something that never existed he didn't
[1:29:36] create it and he won't remember it put
[1:29:39] your sin if you have it into the
[1:29:43] bleach and let the life of Jesus Christ
[1:29:46] live and I'll close with
[1:29:49] this uh from John the first
[1:29:57] chapter and this I know
[1:30:01] you're really familiar with this starts
[1:30:05] out first verse in the beginning was the
[1:30:08] word word was with God Word was God we
[1:30:10] understand that that's logos in the
[1:30:13] beginning was the logos and the logos
[1:30:16] was with God and the word or the logos
[1:30:19] was God that's the power behind behind
[1:30:22] the life it's not just the written word
[1:30:26] Rema is the written word that's these
[1:30:28] little words on paper that have been
[1:30:30] formed it's like it's the building part
[1:30:33] of this church but the
[1:30:36] logos is the people that are here the
[1:30:40] life in the beginning was the life and
[1:30:43] the which was the word and the Word was
[1:30:46] God and so then it and we're familiar
[1:30:48] with this and it was you know it was in
[1:30:50] the beginning with God all things were
[1:30:52] made by him without him not anything was
[1:30:53] made in him was
[1:30:56] what
[1:30:58] life it's about the life of Jesus Christ
[1:31:03] and the life was the light of men the
[1:31:06] life that we people can see when you've
[1:31:10] had your drink and they see that life it
[1:31:14] becomes a light to
[1:31:15] them
[1:31:18] and uh just that light begins to emanate
[1:31:23] through
[1:31:24] Us in spite of the trials in spite of
[1:31:27] all the other things it's the life of
[1:31:30] God manifesting and it says and the
[1:31:32] light shines in the darkness and the
[1:31:34] Darkness comprehends it not no the
[1:31:38] darkness doesn't comprehend it but
[1:31:40] there's people out there who need and
[1:31:42] want and desire to see just a Flicker
[1:31:47] and if even you just give them a flicker
[1:31:49] friends sometimes it can light some
[1:31:52] and I I hadn't thought about it but the
[1:31:56] the story brother renam told about the
[1:31:57] man that was at the car lot and somebody
[1:32:00] put a tract on the
[1:32:02] windshield and he read the tract and all
[1:32:05] he remembered in the tract was that
[1:32:07] where will you spend
[1:32:09] eternity and it actually upset the man
[1:32:12] he watered it up and threw it
[1:32:15] away through the tract away now there's
[1:32:19] people would say oh he just blasphemed
[1:32:20] the Holy Ghost
[1:32:23] but no no not at all because from that
[1:32:27] moment on that man's life changed he
[1:32:30] went home his wife was a Christian and
[1:32:32] he said I want to go to church with you
[1:32:34] which was a big surprise to her you want
[1:32:37] to go where and and and he went to that
[1:32:40] church and this church and then he went
[1:32:41] to this you know Billy Graham and all
[1:32:43] these different places and finally he
[1:32:46] was beginning to think maybe he'd send
[1:32:48] away his day of Grace and done something
[1:32:50] wrong and somebody said well you know if
[1:32:53] you're that Disturbed there's a prophet
[1:32:54] lives down such and such and he went and
[1:32:58] had an
[1:32:59] interview and the way it went in the
[1:33:02] interview he said brother you got the
[1:33:04] Holy Ghost the day you read that
[1:33:08] tract and that's what led you to me to
[1:33:12] hear because it wasn't me as in brother
[1:33:14] Brandon but it was the Holy
[1:33:17] Spirit the life struck him when he read
[1:33:20] the tract and it led him through all
[1:33:22] kinds of
[1:33:25] things toils and snares but it led him
[1:33:29] to the source Jesus Christ speaking to
[1:33:33] that man through a
[1:33:35] prophet the fullness of Jesus Christ so
[1:33:38] to
[1:33:40] finish he says uh he came unto I me down
[1:33:43] dropping down to verse 11 it says and he
[1:33:46] came unto his own and his own received
[1:33:48] him not but as many as received him
[1:33:51] that's a person it's not just written
[1:33:55] word it's not just message books or
[1:33:58] message tapes it's a personal
[1:34:01] relationship that you have with Jesus
[1:34:05] Christ that you surrender your heart I
[1:34:09] surrendered my heart to a a
[1:34:14] person and to as many as received him
[1:34:18] that's the personal presence of Jesus
[1:34:21] Christ CHR to them gave he power to
[1:34:23] become the sons of God even to them that
[1:34:26] believe on his name amen that's pretty
[1:34:29] simple when you get right down to
[1:34:32] it receive him and the power is there
[1:34:36] what he said ask what you will we always
[1:34:39] I I tend to think of all the big things
[1:34:41] and all the stuff
[1:34:42] that you know we think of that as power
[1:34:44] but the power is to become Sons and
[1:34:49] Daughters of God
[1:34:52] what house is he building he's building
[1:34:54] a house a temple from the inside
[1:34:58] out through his son Jesus Christ and he
[1:35:03] what's the criteria believe on his
[1:35:07] name the name he said and the word are
[1:35:10] the same thing and here it's the word or
[1:35:14] the life and it even
[1:35:17] says in him is
[1:35:19] life let the life of God not just for
[1:35:23] yourself not just for
[1:35:25] myself but for someone
[1:35:28] else remember the tree is supposed to
[1:35:30] bear fruit remember brother Stan saying
[1:35:34] that we are here to bear fruit for other
[1:35:37] people and sometimes it's small
[1:35:39] sometimes they'll turn and ren you
[1:35:41] they'll trample you but that's part of
[1:35:44] the the receiving even as he received
[1:35:48] you love him tonight amen praise the
[1:35:50] Lord sister sister you know that song
[1:35:52] creating me a clean heart can we sing
[1:35:55] that that be all
[1:35:57] right he gives us many has received him
[1:36:00] that's the personal and it's so
[1:36:02] important too because when you go to
[1:36:04] where Peter was asked that question who
[1:36:07] do men say that I am and he gave that
[1:36:10] proper truth you're the Christ the son
[1:36:14] of the Living God and he said that uh
[1:36:16] Flesh and Blood didn't reveal that but
[1:36:18] my Father which is in heaven and and so
[1:36:22] we realize it's a revelation and then
[1:36:25] when he goes to the tomb of
[1:36:27] Lazarus and the question came up you
[1:36:31] know about the
[1:36:32] resurrection he didn't say oh you know
[1:36:36] uh Martha in 2,000 years there's going
[1:36:39] to be a resurrection and give her a
[1:36:42] bunch of Doctrine he said I am the
[1:36:45] resurrection and he even went a little
[1:36:47] further and said I am the
[1:36:49] life he that believeth in me though he
[1:36:52] were dead yet shall he live and he that
[1:36:53] believeth in me and is alive shall never
[1:36:56] die isn't that interesting it's the
[1:36:59] person of Jesus Christ in your life
[1:37:02] brother like that smile
[1:37:04] man it's so
[1:37:07] simple just think of it as those two
[1:37:09] little dots it CH they change
[1:37:12] everything let those two little dots
[1:37:14] that time frame that he's given
[1:37:17] us use it to speak to someone else to do
[1:37:22] something for somebody that they can say
[1:37:24] wow that was
[1:37:26] Jesus I've had people you know things
[1:37:29] that I didn't think meant anything and
[1:37:30] people say wow that was from the
[1:37:34] Lord what are you talking
[1:37:36] about it's a life that he gives so that
[1:37:40] we can give God bless you let's stand
[1:37:43] and sing this and sing it as a
[1:37:45] [Music]
[1:37:47] prayer

[1:41:34] with just before I hand it back to
[1:41:39] Isaac when Solomon
[1:41:43] prayed he
[1:41:45] expected an answer from
[1:41:47] God you just prayed yes
[1:41:51] did you sing this as a prayer then we
[1:41:54] expect an answer but there's one thing
[1:41:57] else they did in that sequence in
[1:42:02] Chronicles they
[1:42:05] sacrificed and the
[1:42:08] sacrifice sacrifices were
[1:42:12] consumed so let's just sing this cast me
