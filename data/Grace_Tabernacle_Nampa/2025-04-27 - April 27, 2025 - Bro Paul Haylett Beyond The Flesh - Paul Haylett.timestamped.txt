[35:47] tithes and offerings, the cheerful
[35:48] giver. Lord, that you'd bless them and
[35:50] use them for your glory, Lord Jesus. Use
[35:53] our brother Paul, Lord, to speak to each
[35:55] heart here, Father. And may you anoint
[35:57] every ear to hear and every heart to
[35:59] receive, Lord. And let it change us,

[41:39] 872. Do you stand in awe of the
[41:44] presence? What manner of people ought we
[41:46] to be when we have everything provided?
[41:49] Amen. We have a perfect
[41:52] word. Let's lay down our resistance.
[41:56] Let's give
[41:57] over. Let's surrender all to the word.
[42:01] Amen. I stand in all within the presence
[42:08] of the
[42:11] Lord. In whom the wisdom of the
[42:17] age
[42:20] lie. For whom the raging of the
[42:26] sea
[42:29] subides, the living
[42:34] sacrifice, the only source of life.
[42:41] My
[42:44] hope is in the
[42:48] Lord. From this time
[42:52] on and ever
[42:56] more. Oh my
[43:01] hope is in the
[43:06] Lord

[43:14] His tender mercies come with every How
[43:20] many's experienced that?
[43:24] to meet the sinner in his
[43:31] brokenness to offer healing and
[43:40] forgiveness. And those who trust in
[43:45] him will find their
[43:48] hearts at rest.
[43:51] My
[43:53] hope is in the
[43:58] Lord from this time
[44:02] on forever
[44:06] more. Oh my
[44:10] hope is in the
[44:15] Lord forever more.
[44:19] My
[44:22] trust, oh my
[44:27] trust is in the Lord, the
[44:31] word from this time
[44:36] on and ever more.
[44:41] Oh, my
[44:44] trust is in the
[44:49] Lord
[44:50] forever
[44:53] more. Now my
[44:57] strength, all my
[45:01] strength is in the
[45:06] Lord from this. That's right, Lord.
[45:10] right now in this
[45:11] heart.
[45:14] Hallelujah. Oh, my
[45:18] strength is in the
[45:23] Lord
[45:24] forever
[45:28] more. Hallelujah. Thank the Lord. As our
[45:32] brother comes now to bring the
[45:34] word, I want to sing this song. Fill my
[45:37] cup.
[45:39] Are you willing to have your cup filled?
[45:41] Exactly. Amen. We just turn it up. Say,
[45:44] Lord, here it is. That's all we ought to
[45:45] do. Here am I. Here it is. Fill this
[45:48] cup. Lord, reveal your word to me.
[45:52] Show me your will. I will go. I will do.
[45:57] I will speak. Amen. Amen. Fill my
[46:02] cup, Lord.
[46:06] I lift it
[46:09] up.
[46:12] Lord, come and
[46:16] quench this
[46:18] thirsting of my
[46:22] soul. Just drink. That's all we have to
[46:24] do. Bread of
[46:29] heaven, feed me till I walk.
[46:36] No
[46:37] more. Here's my
[46:41] cup. Fill it up and make me. Now, let's
[46:47] sing the chorus once again. Brother Paul
[46:51] comes. Fill my
[46:54] cup,
[46:57] Lord. Lift it
[47:00] up, Lord.
[47:04] Come and
[47:07] quench this
[47:09] thirsting of my
[47:15] soul. Bread of
[47:22] heaven till I won't no
[47:28] more. Here's my
[47:32] cup. fill it up and make me
[47:39] [Music]
[47:41] whole. God bless you saints. It's just
[47:44] good to be back with you. Amen. I just
[47:48] um take just a moment just to share a
[47:51] few things. Um we
[47:54] uh we had a lovely time in South Africa.
[47:58] it. Um we won't go into some of the
[48:01] details as it were, but um you know they
[48:05] they just a lovely group of people and
[48:08] and um you know to have such uh uh
[48:13] strong leadership for so long and now to
[48:17] be without a pastor, they're just
[48:19] they're going through the struggle. But
[48:21] we know as believers that um the Lord
[48:24] said he would perfect us and we'll go
[48:27] back to the fire just as many times as
[48:29] is necessary for us to be perfected and
[48:33] and we don't like that as as humans. We
[48:35] just want it to be kind of easy. We want
[48:38] it to to just be uh simple. uh but uh
[48:42] God is definitely moving on their behalf
[48:44] and and uh they are they are there
[48:48] laboring still faithful still serving
[48:51] God uh I won't probably name out just
[48:54] individual specific things uh but in
[48:58] general uh we'll see little things a
[49:02] little girl not sure that the Lord loves
[49:04] her but yet at the word she realizes
[49:09] that that God loves her and that just
[49:11] breaks a spirit that's there. Amen. A
[49:14] sister sharing and a testimony. I
[49:17] believe um that you've kind of already
[49:19] heard a little foretaste of that. She
[49:21] was sitting in the Friday evening
[49:23] service and um she's she's there and and
[49:28] uh suddenly uh everything starts to get
[49:32] blurry and she's like, "Oh my, what is
[49:34] happening? I I can't see. I can't see."
[49:37] She took her glasses off and she could
[49:40] see perfectly.
[49:42] Amen. She put her glasses back on and
[49:45] everything is blurry. She takes them
[49:48] back off. Everything is crystal clear.
[49:52] And uh praise God. Just right there in
[49:54] the preaching of the word, not not
[49:56] something directly focused to her in the
[49:59] sense of to those of you that need
[50:01] healing or you need this. Just in the
[50:03] preaching of the word, the Lord healed
[50:05] her. and we're there at the uh Saturday
[50:09] evening uh fireside service and uh she
[50:13] gives this testimony and it stirred my
[50:15] heart because you see this is how God
[50:18] works. It didn't come down that had to
[50:20] be a certain man at a certain time, a
[50:22] certain place, but it was a certain
[50:24] promise. Amen. And God fulfills those
[50:27] promises. and and brother Dale uh maybe
[50:31] Lord willing sometime we can get brother
[50:33] Dale and Sister Pearly to travel all the
[50:35] way here to visit us. But Brother Dale
[50:38] just being who he is, he's just like,
[50:42] "Sister Tracy, God's healed you. Now
[50:46] read the words." And they had beyond
[50:48] where all the chairs were probably
[50:50] farther than this wall to our farthest
[50:53] back wall away. And the words were a
[50:55] little blurry even for this
[50:57] guy. And he's like, "Sister Tracy, God's
[51:00] healed you. Read those words and sing
[51:03] this song." No glasses. She reads them
[51:07] perfectly. Amen. We serve an awesome
[51:10] God. Amen. And little things, my brother
[51:14] and sister, little things that that we
[51:17] sometimes take for granted. a a dear
[51:20] sister is there and she gets up and
[51:23] she's broke up a little bit. She's like,
[51:25] you know, uh I I just so busy trying to
[51:29] uh earn a living, take care of the
[51:30] family, my children in church, and I
[51:33] totally missed my daughter's enrollment
[51:35] in her new school. And when I went there
[51:39] and uh I said, "Oh, I've missed this."
[51:41] And they said, "Sorry, uh the school
[51:44] school is full. there is no room for
[51:48] your child in this school. You'll have
[51:50] to take your child and put her in this
[51:52] other school. And the sister went home
[51:55] and she's like, "Lord, that other
[51:58] school, you have to understand the
[52:00] dynamics of their nation and what's
[52:03] happening there. There's just been a
[52:05] unfortunate degrading of the whole
[52:08] society there." And and the sister's
[52:10] just like, "Lord, I I don't want my
[52:12] daughter in that other school. uh Lord
[52:15] please come on the scene and the Lord
[52:18] comes on the scene and through um
[52:21] circumstances I won't explain all the
[52:23] details they notify her oh we've decided
[52:27] to accept your daughter so that is
[52:30] incredible but the more incredible part
[52:33] is the Lord laid on her heart and said
[52:35] now I've answered your prayer pray for
[52:38] someone who has a need
[52:41] specifically her phone rings and a
[52:44] sister says, "Oh my, I thought my child
[52:46] was in this school. There's been a
[52:48] mistake and now they say she can't go to
[52:50] school there." And the sister shares her
[52:53] testimony, gets down in earnest prayer
[52:56] and says, "Lord, you did it for me."
[52:58] Amen. You did it for my daughter. You
[53:01] can do it for them. A couple days later,
[53:04] the school calls and says, "There's been
[53:06] a mistake. Your daughter is enrolled in
[53:09] this school." Oh, just little little
[53:12] things like that. my brother and sister
[53:14] that God is proving he hears our prayers
[53:17] and sees our needs
[53:21] even the little ones. Even the simple
[53:24] things. Amen. And we'll see how that God
[53:28] just moving in the midst of that. Uh uh
[53:33] my I I just think I would take too long
[53:36] this morning to just go count by count
[53:38] as it were. but to to see things God's
[53:42] doing and how he's answering prayer and
[53:46] how that I I when I say I saints I'm
[53:49] just followed the leading of the Lord. I
[53:52] preached a very uneaster set of meetings
[53:56] for for the saints there at Emanuel
[53:58] Gospel Center. If they were expecting a
[54:00] service on the resurrection and the
[54:03] cross and crucifixion and all of these
[54:06] things there uh they might have been
[54:08] disappointed. But what I did uh do and I
[54:12] can say without boasting is I did follow
[54:14] the leadership of the Holy Spirit and
[54:16] God come in and just started dealing
[54:19] with the people and now they weren't
[54:22] great significant uh headline type
[54:25] things but we we see just how God
[54:29] moving. Uh even this morning I was just
[54:32] wondering how because there's the time
[54:35] difference. Uh uh as I was done with all
[54:38] of my notes, all of my thoughts and just
[54:40] prepared. I I just uh opened up their
[54:43] deal and was listening to a service this
[54:45] morning. A sister got up and gave a
[54:47] testimony today. And uh uh you got to
[54:52] remember even though you know a name
[54:54] might be named, she says, "Oh, in that
[54:56] wonderful service brother Paul
[54:57] preached." But you see, brother Paul did
[55:00] not preach anything. When you give
[55:02] yourself over, that's right. Amen. You
[55:05] are no longer the ambassador of the
[55:07] United States does not come in his own
[55:10] name. He comes in a representation of
[55:14] his government. We come here as sons and
[55:17] daughters of God as representation of
[55:19] our Lord Jesus Christ. And she made a
[55:22] statement this in the service this
[55:24] morning and says the wonderful service
[55:27] and and she goes on to describe the
[55:29] sisters had some spiritual battles,
[55:31] great spiritual battles and sometimes
[55:34] not always come out of those battles so
[55:36] well, but she was in a service and she
[55:39] says that she was there and she felt a
[55:41] presence around her and and I'm just
[55:43] going to gloss over the details, but but
[55:45] she said then she realized there was
[55:47] something around her and When you're
[55:51] there, just if you think ahead, you
[55:52] think, "Oh, that was the Holy Spirit
[55:54] surrounding her." But she realized there
[55:56] was a cage.
[56:01] Then she realized the cage was lifting.
[56:04] Amen. And the Lord set her free. Amen.
[56:07] That's the God we serve. Amen. Amen. So
[56:11] every one of us, right, the thunders,
[56:13] right, is just God's voice. Not some
[56:15] particular man to stand up and say, "I'm
[56:18] the voice." But the thunders are God's
[56:20] voice and he uses you. He uses me. He
[56:24] uses whoever he deems necessary to do
[56:28] the speaking. Amen. Let our lives speak
[56:31] of the gospel of Jesus Christ. Amen. We
[56:34] saw healings. We saw deliverances. We
[56:38] saw the word come forth. We saw people
[56:41] break from just kind of a general air of
[56:44] of uh um I don't know kind of uh
[56:50] subdued to find a liberty and and uh I
[56:54] thank the Lord for that uh that we were
[56:57] uh counted privileged of the Lord to to
[56:59] be there to be able to speak to the
[57:02] people and to see that. Now, my brother
[57:06] and sister, I will speak this spot
[57:08] straightforward. There are there are
[57:11] believers there in that church that
[57:13] believe it or not actually stream our
[57:15] services. And um I know they'll hear
[57:18] this, but um you know, there's just a
[57:21] little undercurrent of who will be the
[57:23] pastor. And this segment here wants this
[57:25] brother. This segment wants this
[57:27] brother. This segment wants this
[57:29] brother. But what we need to pray for
[57:31] and be faithful saints is to pray the
[57:34] Lord's will be done. We do not want
[57:37] politics to direct the church. Amen. Cuz
[57:40] we can just look at our national
[57:42] government, our federal government, and
[57:44] see what politics does for us. Amen. So,
[57:47] just please be faithful to lift Emanuel
[57:50] Gospel Center up in prayer. Uh and uh
[57:54] just the Lord is faithful. Um and uh
[57:57] there one of the brothers in the church,
[58:00] a dear dear friend of mine, Brother
[58:01] Danny Pullman, uh just uh just on Easter
[58:05] weekend was invited to go down to a
[58:07] little work that has started in a
[58:09] township um about 5 hours outside of
[58:14] Johannesburg. And uh the word has just
[58:16] come to this area and and uh God is
[58:19] working so mightily. They thought there
[58:21] might be 30 35 people. 70 showed up.
[58:26] They baptized seven of those and two
[58:29] more are desiring to be baptized. So God
[58:33] knows the timing. He knows the place. He
[58:36] knows the seasons and everything. And
[58:39] and so God is still working. He's still
[58:41] calling a bride. And uh one beautiful
[58:44] thing about South Africa at this stage
[58:48] of life, stage of time that maybe the
[58:51] cities are more uh religious, spirit
[58:53] oriented, but out in in the uh in the
[58:56] small areas, rural areas, the townships,
[59:00] uh people, poverty, all kinds of issues
[59:03] that go on. Not their fault, you would
[59:06] say, because it's the government that
[59:08] creates some of these issues. Amen. the
[59:11] government. There's so much racism
[59:13] there, but it's the government who says,
[59:15] "We got to stop it while they promote
[59:17] it." Amen. Is that not the devil's way
[59:20] of working? Amen. He says, "Oh, this is
[59:23] not good." While he's over here
[59:24] promoting. And so, we'll look at this
[59:27] and uh realize that God still is moving.
[59:31] Amen. We live, we can use this as an
[59:34] excuse or we can also realize that God's
[59:38] still calling us. We live in a city that
[59:41] has uh according to a text I just
[59:43] received lately, they keep inviting me
[59:45] to their to their uh uh ministerial
[59:49] association meetings here. Uh according
[59:52] to their deal, there's over 120 churches
[59:55] in the city of
[59:57] Nampa. That
[59:59] sounds pretty awesome.
[1:00:03] I mean, man, the gospel should be
[1:00:05] changing this city, turning it upside
[1:00:07] down and shaking it. But we know what
[1:00:10] the word said. I didn't go ahead and
[1:00:12] include the quote this morning, but I
[1:00:14] can tell you the prophet of God said,
[1:00:16] "They weren't called to see it. They'll
[1:00:18] never see it because it wasn't sent to
[1:00:21] them." Now, that sounds very strong, my
[1:00:23] brother and sister, but that's according
[1:00:26] to the word of God. Now, I will say
[1:00:28] this, don't misunderstand me. If it
[1:00:30] wasn't us, God would still have a work
[1:00:33] here that was the truth. But by God's
[1:00:37] grace, can someone say God's grace?
[1:00:40] Amen. Our eyes have been opened. Amen.
[1:00:44] So, we're in a world that some of these
[1:00:46] people there have never had a
[1:00:48] relationship. They've never been in a
[1:00:50] church. They've never did that. I would
[1:00:52] be honest with you and tell you that my
[1:00:55] thoughts are there'd be very few in the
[1:00:57] city of Nampa who haven't had uh their
[1:01:00] life touched by church and different
[1:01:02] things. And yet there's parts of the
[1:01:04] world that God is still coming onto
[1:01:08] fresh ground on virgin ground and and
[1:01:10] souls are being saved.
[1:01:13] But while we're here sifting, let us be
[1:01:16] faithful. Amen. We don't have to have
[1:01:19] some great audience. We don't have to
[1:01:21] have that. But let those that the Lord
[1:01:23] has called us to come in association
[1:01:26] with let our light shine and let it
[1:01:28] shine brightly. Amen. Cuz remember when
[1:01:31] the globe is clean, remember behold the
[1:01:34] bridegroom cometh. They cleaned their
[1:01:36] globe. The lamp was full of oil. But
[1:01:38] remember my brother and sister, the
[1:01:40] globe being clean doesn't just shine the
[1:01:42] light for you. It also is shining out on
[1:01:46] everyone around you. And I say Lord, let
[1:01:49] us be faithful to that. Amen. We will we
[1:01:53] will work with the brothers. I I have
[1:01:55] some pictures uh just uh this morning uh
[1:01:59] um didn't didn't really have preparation
[1:02:01] for that. Uh unfortunately, forgive me
[1:02:04] for this. I don't want to use it as
[1:02:06] excuse, but I I came home. We just
[1:02:09] barely got there. I had jet lag so bad
[1:02:12] that I would wake up Idaho time every
[1:02:15] single night. Only the problem is we're
[1:02:18] so far off set. I would be tired. I
[1:02:20] would go to sleep. I would wake up at
[1:02:22] 1:30 in the morning and uh realize at at
[1:02:27] home, oh yeah, this is where it's at. I
[1:02:30] would then fall asleep about 6:45 and if
[1:02:34] no one would have disturbed me, I
[1:02:35] probably could have slept till noon. And
[1:02:38] uh but yet I set alarms, we had
[1:02:40] meetings, we had people to meet with, we
[1:02:43] had things to do, conferences and all of
[1:02:45] these things. And then it all comes to
[1:02:48] an end and I fly home and now I'm waking
[1:02:51] up on South African time. And uh so so
[1:02:56] just a real real quandry there. But
[1:02:58] anyway, so much about that. Amen. Please
[1:03:01] remember our brother Donnie Pulman.
[1:03:03] Amen. Obviously, we brought as a prayer
[1:03:05] request to remember our brother David
[1:03:07] Lunsford and uh to remember sister Sue's
[1:03:10] son Dana. Amen. Uh and uh cancer
[1:03:14] returning. And um we just want the Lord
[1:03:17] to touch him. Most of all, we want to
[1:03:19] just see the Dana that we knew years ago
[1:03:21] with a heart that burned on fire for the
[1:03:23] gospel and see that come in his life
[1:03:26] once again. Amen. And uh obviously, God
[1:03:30] bless you, brother Salem. Uh remember
[1:03:32] our sister Wander this morning. Now, it
[1:03:35] was brought up, it took me a minute, my
[1:03:37] mind was uh caught up in a different
[1:03:39] thought. Uh, Sister Rebecca there in
[1:03:41] South
[1:03:42] Africa, wonderful little girl of a
[1:03:45] family in the church. Her family is
[1:03:47] very, very poor. But aren't you glad
[1:03:49] your financial position doesn't denote
[1:03:52] your spiritual position? Anyway, she was
[1:03:56] walking to school and somebody kidnapped
[1:03:58] her. They have given a ransom note that
[1:04:01] is impossible to be met. And uh so we
[1:04:05] just want the Lord to come on the scene
[1:04:08] and just move on the heart of these
[1:04:10] people that instead of harming her in
[1:04:14] their frustrations that uh in the end
[1:04:17] the Holy Spirit will move upon them,
[1:04:19] they'll release her. She is I didn't
[1:04:21] know her personally, but they say she's
[1:04:23] just the sweetest little girl that you
[1:04:26] could ever meet. and uh her family there
[1:04:29] there's not even a hope that they could
[1:04:32] raise the original ransom that was given
[1:04:35] and uh the police uh they just shrug
[1:04:39] their
[1:04:40] shoulders. They don't really pursue
[1:04:42] these things. They don't really even try
[1:04:44] and find a solution. It happens so
[1:04:48] regular that they have become jaded uh
[1:04:51] to the whole issue. So, let's remember
[1:04:54] our our little sister Rebecca and uh the
[1:04:57] Lord would just come on this scene. Uh
[1:04:59] and one of those men. It's all it takes.
[1:05:01] Doesn't have to change a whole group.
[1:05:03] All it's got to do is change the heart
[1:05:04] of one man and let that man be one to
[1:05:08] say, "This little girl suffered enough
[1:05:11] and turn her loose." Amen. Did you enjoy
[1:05:14] Brother Daniel for Easter? Amen. Good
[1:05:18] services, good ministering of the word.
[1:05:21] Amen. And I believe that uh that won't
[1:05:23] be the last that we see of brother
[1:05:25] Daniel. Amen. Uh I just really
[1:05:28] appreciate him and his lovely wife um
[1:05:31] their their atmosphere around them.
[1:05:34] Amen. And I'm chewing my way down the
[1:05:36] list here. Amen. Sister
[1:05:40] April, our hearts are now
[1:05:43] relieved. You're home and you're healthy
[1:05:46] and uh praise the Lord. Um, you know,
[1:05:50] Sister Jerry and I was just counting the
[1:05:53] time when we estimated that you would be
[1:05:55] back on the continent, uh, our
[1:05:57] continent. And, um, we're just happy to
[1:06:00] see you. And, uh, God bless you. Amen.
[1:06:04] Sister April has I know that there's
[1:06:06] some things that she uh has to reserve
[1:06:09] about sharing. But my brother and
[1:06:11] sister, if we could make that much of a
[1:06:14] difference in the lives of people,
[1:06:16] people that uh have all kinds of of
[1:06:19] things and just uh a helping hand in a
[1:06:22] prayer changes their world. Um I say,
[1:06:26] Lord, just uh continue to touch uh the
[1:06:29] the needy. Amen. You know, some people
[1:06:32] may have heard the name of Jesus, but
[1:06:34] they've never seen a manifestation of
[1:06:36] Christ in their presence. And sometimes
[1:06:39] the Lord just uses our hands uh and such
[1:06:43] a fashion that it doesn't seem
[1:06:45] spectacular as far as the preaching of
[1:06:47] the gospel, but to people who are on the
[1:06:50] receiving end, they realize God's done
[1:06:53] something good for them. Amen. Uh youth
[1:06:56] service this Friday. Looks like good
[1:06:59] chunk of the youth are gone. But um
[1:07:02] anyway, those of you here, youth service
[1:07:04] here at the church on Friday at 7
[1:07:06] o'clock and um also I think brother
[1:07:09] Adam's the only one that doesn't know,
[1:07:11] but I would like to have a little
[1:07:13] meeting with the trustees um right after
[1:07:15] the service. Amen. Let's stand and just
[1:07:18] go into the word. I want to talk to you
[1:07:21] this morning on on a thought that uh uh
[1:07:24] has been with me uh the last few days
[1:07:27] and uh I just want to come and I pray
[1:07:30] that the Lord will help me to articulate
[1:07:33] this uh in a fashion that uh uh would be
[1:07:37] a blessing to you. I want to speak to
[1:07:39] you on beyond the flesh. Amen. Let's go
[1:07:43] to John 1:1. And um we'll just lay a a
[1:07:48] foundation here. Um we sure appreciated
[1:07:51] your prayers. Uh Sister Jerry's not
[1:07:54] feeling well right now, but the Lord was
[1:07:56] with us. Amen. After traveling, um you
[1:08:01] know, I had an individual ask me uh how
[1:08:04] my vacation was. And um I I will tell
[1:08:08] you that uh the first part of our
[1:08:12] vacation was something on the order of
[1:08:15] 25 hours in an airplane. And Sister
[1:08:18] April will know exactly what we're
[1:08:20] talking about at the point that you go
[1:08:22] numb somewhere from here down. And um
[1:08:26] then the last two days of our vacation
[1:08:30] was the exact same in reverse. And in
[1:08:34] the middle, we never went to bed before
[1:08:36] midnight. And uh but I would do it again
[1:08:39] in a heartbeat. Amen.
[1:08:42] John 1:1. In the beginning was the word,
[1:08:45] and the word was with God, and the word
[1:08:47] was God. The same was in the beginning
[1:08:49] with God. All things were made by him,
[1:08:52] and without him was not anything made
[1:08:55] that was made. In him was life, and the
[1:08:59] life was the light of men. And the light
[1:09:02] shineth in darkness, and the darkness
[1:09:04] comprehended it not. There was a man
[1:09:06] sent from God, whose name was John. The
[1:09:09] same came for a witness to bear witness
[1:09:12] of the light, that all men through him
[1:09:15] might believe. He was not that light,
[1:09:17] but he was sent to bear witness of that
[1:09:20] light. And I believe we can identify
[1:09:22] with verse eight. Amen. We could not
[1:09:25] stand here today and say, "I am the
[1:09:27] light." But the light is in us. And we
[1:09:30] can bear witness of that light. And I
[1:09:33] say thank you, Lord. Amen, for that.
[1:09:36] That was the true light which lightth
[1:09:39] every man that cometh into the world. He
[1:09:41] was in the world, and the world was made
[1:09:43] by him, and the world knew him not. He
[1:09:47] came unto his own, and his own received
[1:09:49] him not. Now, this is referring, my
[1:09:52] brother and sister, to the Jews who had
[1:09:55] spent all of those decades perfecting
[1:09:59] how it would be when the Messiah come,
[1:10:01] it will be just like this. But I just
[1:10:04] listened to the prophet a couple days
[1:10:06] ago or might have been yesterday uh uh
[1:10:09] saying that uh in spite of that
[1:10:13] scripture and in spite of how they did
[1:10:15] that, he came perfectly according to the
[1:10:18] word. So that means somewhere along the
[1:10:21] line they changed the scope or the
[1:10:24] meaning of the word. So they were
[1:10:27] looking at the word in a different
[1:10:29] approach, a different way and still
[1:10:32] believing they had the word. Yeah. Now
[1:10:35] I'm going to put something in here
[1:10:37] that's not changed in our day. Amen.
[1:10:41] People will stay home and push play and
[1:10:43] say we're fulfilling the word of God.
[1:10:45] But are they now? Sorry to put that in
[1:10:48] there, but we got to remember the
[1:10:51] misinterpretation of a prophet's message
[1:10:54] is not in days gone by. It is taking
[1:10:57] place right now. And so we got to be
[1:11:00] careful that we don't just interpret
[1:11:03] that uh to come in the way we thought
[1:11:05] because that's what the Jews did. That's
[1:11:07] what the Sadducees, Pharisees did. Amen.
[1:11:11] And he came unto his own, his own
[1:11:12] received him not. But as many as
[1:11:14] received him, to them gave he power to
[1:11:17] become the sons of God, even to them
[1:11:20] that believe on his name, which were
[1:11:22] born not of blood, nor of the will of
[1:11:25] the flesh, nor of the will of man, but
[1:11:27] of God. And the word was made flesh and
[1:11:31] dwelt among us. And we beheld his glory,
[1:11:34] the glory as of the only begotten of the
[1:11:36] Father, full of grace and truth.
[1:11:39] Heavenly Father, Lord, it's good to be
[1:11:42] back here with my brothers and sisters.
[1:11:44] And Father, I pray you just come down
[1:11:46] this morning. Lord, just speak to our
[1:11:48] hearts. Father, let us realize how
[1:11:51] important we are in your plan. We are
[1:11:54] not just a happen stance. We're not just
[1:11:56] a side note, but Father, how you so
[1:11:59] focused your plan, so focused your word
[1:12:02] to come, Lord, and was so gracious to
[1:12:05] include us in that plan. bless this time
[1:12:08] I pray in the name of Jesus Christ.
[1:12:11] Amen. You may be seated. Also, I bring
[1:12:14] greetings to you. our brother Tim Dodd
[1:12:18] had been asked uh to come and help be an
[1:12:22] encouragement to the saints there and uh
[1:12:25] some of you will know brother Tim Dodd
[1:12:27] from up in Cloverdale uh and uh Grand
[1:12:30] Prairie originally and uh he sends his
[1:12:33] greetings or brother John Andy's sends
[1:12:36] his greetings and um met a wonderful
[1:12:39] brother that's been coming over preached
[1:12:41] for brother John Andes a few times uh
[1:12:43] brother Mediva uh got to meet him. Just
[1:12:46] a wonderful man. Who knows the Lord give
[1:12:49] us an opportunity would like to bring
[1:12:51] him uh sometime to come and preach for
[1:12:54] us. Just just a wonderful wonderful
[1:12:56] brother. Amen. Now we see how the words
[1:13:01] describing the word our Lord Jesus
[1:13:03] Christ. How that he come in the flesh to
[1:13:05] us and and it was there that uh God come
[1:13:09] down because he wanted to have a witness
[1:13:11] that was at our level. Now, John was
[1:13:13] there and John was a true witness called
[1:13:15] of God. But yet, God said, "You know
[1:13:18] what? I want to bring another witness,
[1:13:20] one with authority beyond what John
[1:13:23] has." And so, I'm going to come and I'm
[1:13:25] going to give a witness. And there's no
[1:13:27] greater witness than our Lord Jesus
[1:13:29] Christ himself. And so, he comes down
[1:13:31] and and comes in flesh and is there
[1:13:34] before us. He was the word made
[1:13:36] manifest. And I want to look at this now
[1:13:39] and just look at some of the previous
[1:13:42] appearances. Now when our Lord Jesus
[1:13:44] Christ come, we can say, well, he had to
[1:13:47] come as a lamb to be slain. He had to be
[1:13:50] the sacrifice. He had to fulfill all
[1:13:52] these things. But we want to look at
[1:13:54] this and recognize that God's appearing
[1:13:57] in the flesh was not just in the body as
[1:14:00] it were of our Lord Jesus Christ, but
[1:14:03] had come in previous appearances. had
[1:14:06] come in previous times. It's it's kind
[1:14:08] of like my brother and sister, I've got
[1:14:10] to throw this out. Uh uh I hope it
[1:14:12] doesn't isn't more confusing than it is
[1:14:15] beneficial. But when the prophet of God
[1:14:18] uh comes and he's speaking speaking in
[1:14:20] the church, speaking of visions he's
[1:14:22] seen, speaking of these things, and he
[1:14:24] starts to describe to the believers the
[1:14:27] tent vision. He says, "I see this and
[1:14:30] this happens. This happens. This
[1:14:31] happens." And as it is, even the prophet
[1:14:34] of God in the early stages there
[1:14:37] believed that literally they were going
[1:14:39] to buy a tent and they were going to
[1:14:41] haul it from place to place and set it
[1:14:43] up and God was going to come down in a
[1:14:46] little wooden building inside of the
[1:14:48] tent and do supernatural. The prophet of
[1:14:51] God was waiting for that day had spoke
[1:14:54] personally to to men and brethren and
[1:14:56] some had a commitment. Some said we will
[1:14:59] provide the truck to haul the tent. we
[1:15:01] will do this, we will do that. They were
[1:15:03] even talking of what size the tent would
[1:15:06] need to be and various factors. But if
[1:15:08] you look very carefully at the end of
[1:15:10] brother Brandham's ministry, he starts
[1:15:12] to allude that the tent that God showed
[1:15:15] him and the little house that he showed
[1:15:17] him was not a literal tent, but it was a
[1:15:21] overshadowing of it is of that. And my
[1:15:24] brother and sister, we are the house of
[1:15:27] God. We are the abode of God. You could
[1:15:29] apply that. are the tent. Amen. And the
[1:15:32] little room that the prophet saw and uh
[1:15:35] the Holy Spirit said, "I'll meet you in
[1:15:37] there." My brother and sister, the
[1:15:39] prophet then comes and starts to focus
[1:15:41] how that this is literally the soul of
[1:15:44] man. This is literally the place that
[1:15:46] God meets man. He does meet man in a
[1:15:49] building somewhere. He does meet man in
[1:15:51] the woods and here and there. But the
[1:15:53] place that he meets man is in the soul.
[1:15:56] Amen. And just listening the last few
[1:15:58] days, the prophet of God reiterating how
[1:16:00] at that point of time that science had
[1:16:02] just discovered there was that place in
[1:16:04] the heart that they can find no real
[1:16:07] reason for that little spot in the
[1:16:09] heart. It doesn't seemingly serve a a a
[1:16:12] purpose, but yet we know that God is
[1:16:14] perfect, right? He didn't come along and
[1:16:16] say, "Man, I lost the page of the
[1:16:18] blueprint of what that was." But he put
[1:16:20] a place in the heart. And my brother and
[1:16:22] sister, we'll see how that the word has
[1:16:25] showed us. so clearly from the heart.
[1:16:28] Amen. As a man would thinkketh in his
[1:16:30] heart, so shall he be. And and there has
[1:16:32] to be something besides just muscles and
[1:16:35] and valves and a a flow there for God to
[1:16:38] speak in such a fashion. But there's
[1:16:41] something there that is alive and well.
[1:16:43] And we are able as sons and daughters of
[1:16:45] God to manifest that word from our
[1:16:48] heart. It is our heart speaking. Because
[1:16:51] be honest with you, I can't trust my
[1:16:53] brain.
[1:16:54] I can't trust my emotions as it were.
[1:16:58] But one thing I know is when God speaks
[1:17:00] to my heart, it has never failed yet.
[1:17:03] Amen. When I listen to my heart
[1:17:05] according to the word, it has never
[1:17:08] failed me yet. And so, we see how
[1:17:10] faithful that God is. And so, we look at
[1:17:12] this and we see the prophet that that
[1:17:15] vision coming to pass in a different
[1:17:17] fashion than what we did. And this is
[1:17:19] why we have to stop and not just
[1:17:22] interpret the message.
[1:17:24] take it from carnal. Well, we're going
[1:17:25] to take it literally word by word. Well,
[1:17:28] I'll tell you, I will not disregard
[1:17:29] that. The prophet's words is the people
[1:17:31] don't recognize the value of saying only
[1:17:34] what the prophet said. But if you don't
[1:17:36] understand by revelation what he said,
[1:17:40] then you will not get the the whole
[1:17:42] story, not get the whole picture. Amen.
[1:17:44] You might just end up being like a
[1:17:46] puppet or a parrot and speak that. But
[1:17:48] God doesn't deal on that level. God's
[1:17:51] dealing on the level of a personal
[1:17:53] revelation to you and I. Amen. And so it
[1:17:56] is here that we look back through
[1:17:58] scripture briefly. There's a lot more
[1:18:00] examples here, my brother and sister,
[1:18:02] but we look back just real quickly
[1:18:05] today. Uh if you want to turn, you can.
[1:18:08] But Genesis 14, we'll see that Abram,
[1:18:11] Amen. Here he was a man called of God
[1:18:15] was in a certain position yet not and
[1:18:19] these are just my words not in his
[1:18:21] vindicated glorified possession. You see
[1:18:26] God changed his name and it was
[1:18:27] necessary that his name be changed for
[1:18:30] him to possess his promise. Amen. God
[1:18:34] didn't have to have it that way but
[1:18:35] that's how God chose it to be. And so as
[1:18:38] it is that here he is is coming in
[1:18:40] Genesis 14. He's returning from the
[1:18:43] slaughter of the kings. He's went out
[1:18:45] and and saved the life, if you would
[1:18:47] call that, and redeemed his his um uh uh
[1:18:52] family. He's redeemed Lot and and uh and
[1:18:56] pulled him back. And God was pleased by
[1:18:59] Abram's behavior, his desire. Now, my
[1:19:02] brother and sister, remember this is the
[1:19:04] same lot that actually was a thorn in
[1:19:07] his flesh. the same lot that caused
[1:19:11] trouble. But yet Abram did not forsake
[1:19:14] him because it was of his family and he
[1:19:17] had actually made a previous promise
[1:19:19] that he would take care of them. Even
[1:19:22] when God said, "Leave all your family
[1:19:25] behind." Right? So seemingly this is a
[1:19:29] contradiction. Seemingly Abram went
[1:19:32] against God's word and he takes him with
[1:19:35] him. But look how the perfect will of
[1:19:38] God sometimes is hidden in our mistakes.
[1:19:42] It's hidden in what we think and how we
[1:19:46] felt about it. And and God says, "Oh,
[1:19:49] you're going to look at this later and
[1:19:50] say, "I made a mistake." But God's going
[1:19:52] to say, "I knew that's how it needed to
[1:19:54] be, and I anointed you to do what you're
[1:19:58] doing so that this could come to pass
[1:20:00] and my word would be fulfilled and I
[1:20:03] would receive glory." Amen. And it all
[1:20:05] comes down, my brother and sister, that
[1:20:07] God is there for us even when we
[1:20:11] misunderstand what God is doing. Amen.
[1:20:15] So here he comes and the return from the
[1:20:17] slaughter of the kings and and um as it
[1:20:20] is Melchzdc, we'll just cut it right to
[1:20:23] the chase. He comes, Amen. the king of
[1:20:26] Salem. He comes right there. He's the
[1:20:28] king of peace. He's everything. And he
[1:20:31] sits down and he is fellowshipping with
[1:20:34] Abram. And the thing that I find so
[1:20:36] remarkable is he breaks bread and wine
[1:20:39] and makes promises to Abram. He speaks
[1:20:42] to Abram in such a fashion you'd never
[1:20:45] miss. You'd never catch, I guess, the
[1:20:47] the point. You can miss that the fact
[1:20:50] that not all was just perfect according
[1:20:53] to God's will. What God had told Abram
[1:20:56] to do, it wasn't all fitting perfectly
[1:20:58] in the box. But God was looking just
[1:21:01] like you and I. God was looking on his
[1:21:04] heart and his heart was true and his
[1:21:06] heart was faithful. And so here is th
[1:21:09] this one who is there meeting with
[1:21:12] Abram. And um the word of God shows us
[1:21:16] so clearly my brother and sister that it
[1:21:19] is Melchzdc that is there. Amen. Now,
[1:21:23] some people in ages gone by uh thought
[1:21:26] Melchzdc was just another uh uh like
[1:21:29] another angel as it were, another part
[1:21:32] of God's economy, a part of his his
[1:21:35] force, you might say, that was there to
[1:21:37] support the word. But we see clearly by
[1:21:40] the promises that are made how it's
[1:21:43] given. It doesn't say and God said, but
[1:21:46] Melchzdc is speaking to Abram lip to ear
[1:21:51] making a personal promise. Now, we have
[1:21:54] to look at this, my brother and sister.
[1:21:56] If you are looking Now, now let me say
[1:21:59] this correctly. Lord, help me. If you're
[1:22:01] looking to take the promise that brother
[1:22:03] Brandham said and and I this should take
[1:22:06] place because brother Brham said my
[1:22:09] brother and sister you've missed the
[1:22:10] point of what God is trying to do in
[1:22:12] your life and in my life. God's wanting
[1:22:15] to bring you and I down that we
[1:22:17] personally are there lipto receiving
[1:22:21] promises not from a secondary not from a
[1:22:24] lesser but from God himself. It needs to
[1:22:28] be that personal of a promise to us that
[1:22:31] we grasp and can say, "You know what?
[1:22:33] God told me." Amen. I love I love this
[1:22:36] message with all my life, but my brother
[1:22:39] and sister, sometimes we we count on or
[1:22:42] hold to what I would say is secondhand
[1:22:45] testimony
[1:22:46] too strongly. God's wanting us to move
[1:22:49] from an impersonal relationship which is
[1:22:52] second or third hand into a personal
[1:22:55] relationship that we can sit here and
[1:22:58] say God told me now. Not God told me and
[1:23:01] then we change our mind of what God told
[1:23:03] us. Amen. Or we go a season and say well
[1:23:06] now God's told me this and that
[1:23:08] contradicts that but God told me. No, we
[1:23:10] want to come to a place God told me and
[1:23:14] it's the word.
[1:23:16] Nothing but the word. Amen. No other
[1:23:19] influence. Amen. So here it is. He's
[1:23:22] there and and
[1:23:26] Abram Mechzdc speaks to him and says,
[1:23:29] "You know what? Once you've kind of
[1:23:31] satisfied the princes and these kind of
[1:23:33] things, just keep the spoil, the rest of
[1:23:36] the spoil to yourself." But Abram had a
[1:23:40] revelation and he gave tithe to Melchzdc
[1:23:44] to God there on the scene. He says,
[1:23:47] "Lest they would think that I did this
[1:23:49] to enrich
[1:23:50] myself." Oh my brother and sister, I
[1:23:53] tell you sometimes, now let me deviate
[1:23:55] for a minute. One of the things
[1:23:57] sometimes that undermines the harmony in
[1:24:01] a church is when people start to think
[1:24:04] that someone did something to enrich
[1:24:07] themselves. Oh my brother and sister,
[1:24:10] let it not be counted amongst us. Amen.
[1:24:13] If you want to pray for blessings uh in
[1:24:15] the natural upon the body of believers,
[1:24:18] start with the poorest family. Start
[1:24:20] with the one that has a greater need.
[1:24:22] Leave your own need as a last. Amen.
[1:24:25] Leave it as a least. And and let God's
[1:24:28] perfect will be done. Now, I will say
[1:24:30] this. Sometimes there's families that
[1:24:32] that are in need, my brother and sister.
[1:24:34] But God knows they can't hold and handle
[1:24:38] the gold.
[1:24:41] And the word says he won't try you more
[1:24:43] than you can handle. So God's not going
[1:24:45] to handle you wealth so you can ruin
[1:24:47] your life and fail.
[1:24:49] Now I know that's a little bit blunt,
[1:24:51] but certainly there are some who just
[1:24:54] simply can't handle the money. And so
[1:24:57] God has made a promise, amen, that he
[1:25:00] won't place anything more upon you than
[1:25:02] you can handle. So I would rather live
[1:25:05] in a position of always a shadow of a
[1:25:08] need in my life. And I need to call upon
[1:25:11] the Lord than I would to have the wealth
[1:25:12] and it ruined me. Amen.
[1:25:16] Bring us to a place, Lord, we're still
[1:25:18] dependent on you. Don't bring us to a
[1:25:21] place we start to rely that we think we
[1:25:24] have accomplished something. But to look
[1:25:26] at this and say, Lord, let me remain
[1:25:30] needy. That's right. In you. Amen.
[1:25:33] So now he appeared there in Genesis 14
[1:25:38] uh to Abram returning from the slaughter
[1:25:41] of the kings. And then we see in Genesis
[1:25:44] 18. Amen. So here is is Abraham the the
[1:25:50] story there in the middle between 14 and
[1:25:52] 18. You you're well aware of the Lord
[1:25:55] speak to him and says, you know, I'm
[1:25:57] changing your name. I'm changing Sarah's
[1:26:00] name. And so you'll now be Abraham and
[1:26:03] you will be Sarah instead of Abram and
[1:26:06] Sarahi. So God coming and changing the
[1:26:09] name. My brother and sister, we got to
[1:26:11] have a name change our own self. If
[1:26:13] we're going to manifest all the promise
[1:26:14] of God, we cannot be identified and
[1:26:17] named by the old man. We cannot be named
[1:26:21] by what we were out there. But God has
[1:26:24] come and given us a new name. And I say
[1:26:26] thank you. Amen. Because you see as the
[1:26:29] scripture I opened with, he gave us the
[1:26:32] power to become sons of God. Amen. We
[1:26:36] extend that out. Sons and daughters of
[1:26:38] God. He gave us the power to do that.
[1:26:41] There has to be a change associated with
[1:26:44] that. And so I don't want to deviate
[1:26:47] back too far, but maybe you remember we
[1:26:49] preached before we went to South Africa
[1:26:52] that when those uh patriarchs, their
[1:26:54] mothers, Amen. as they're giving birth,
[1:26:56] they cried out a name and that name
[1:26:59] positionally placed them. And that's why
[1:27:01] our new birth, my brother and sister,
[1:27:03] the prophet of God said, a birth is
[1:27:05] always messy. Amen. If we have a
[1:27:08] clinical birth, my brother and sister,
[1:27:10] we have not had a true birth. Amen. It
[1:27:13] needs to be messy. It needs to come down
[1:27:15] to the place that we literally declare,
[1:27:17] I cannot live without you, Lord. As long
[1:27:20] as we remain in the flesh, you can be
[1:27:23] blessed by the blessings of God. But the
[1:27:25] true blessing, my brother and sister, is
[1:27:27] the birth. Amen. Amen. It is not
[1:27:30] prosperity. That's right. It's not
[1:27:32] talents. But it's the new birth. Amen.
[1:27:35] We can have a religious spirit and we
[1:27:37] can go all of our life saying, "I praise
[1:27:39] God. I worship just like everyone else."
[1:27:42] But without that new birth, my brother
[1:27:44] and sister, we're a lot closer to Cain
[1:27:46] than we think we are. That's right.
[1:27:48] Amen. Now, I know that's a little blunt,
[1:27:51] but I want nothing to do with Cain's way
[1:27:53] of worship. It might be beautiful. It
[1:27:56] might be talented, but it wasn't in the
[1:27:59] blood. It wasn't messy. It was clinical.
[1:28:03] And so, as we look here in Genesis 18,
[1:28:06] so he comes to Abraham's tent on the
[1:28:09] plains of memory and um as he's there,
[1:28:12] Abraham looks out and he sees three men.
[1:28:15] Now my brother and sister, he did not in
[1:28:18] a distance say, "Oh, that's God." But as
[1:28:22] he comes closer, God anoints Abram with
[1:28:25] revelation to understand that he's in
[1:28:28] the presence of his Lord. Now, this is
[1:28:31] not just a a a man with a greater
[1:28:34] fortune, greater authority uh than
[1:28:37] Abraham, but he recognizes deity. Oh,
[1:28:40] Lord, help you and I to recognize deity
[1:28:43] in our midst. Amen. The prophet of God
[1:28:46] preached a sermon on the unrecognized
[1:28:48] presence of God. Amen. And he's in our
[1:28:51] midst sometimes. We don't even recognize
[1:28:54] it. We would greet those three men and
[1:28:57] not differentiate one from the other.
[1:28:59] But God anointed Abraham to recognize
[1:29:02] that here in his presence is one that is
[1:29:06] greater. Here is one that he is there to
[1:29:10] give recognition to. And he starts to
[1:29:13] speak that now this was a physical body.
[1:29:17] My brother and sister, this was not a
[1:29:19] mystical body that came to Abram at the
[1:29:22] slaughter of the kings. It was a
[1:29:25] physical body. But the prophet of God
[1:29:27] explains to us that was in a theophinic
[1:29:30] form. It was there God putting himself
[1:29:34] into a body and it's there. He's
[1:29:37] standing there. That body would eat,
[1:29:39] could touch, feel, etc.
[1:29:42] But that body did not experience
[1:29:45] fatigue. It did not experience stress.
[1:29:48] It was not a body that would be
[1:29:50] crucified. And so as he is standing
[1:29:53] there now in the midst of Abraham on the
[1:29:55] plains of memory, Abraham by revelation
[1:29:59] recognizes and says, "My Lord." Now
[1:30:02] those that were with them, my brother
[1:30:03] and sister, he give recognition to them,
[1:30:06] but he's also not giving the position of
[1:30:09] deity to them.
[1:30:11] Now, see, there's the difference between
[1:30:13] it being our Lord and being his
[1:30:16] servants. That's it. Oh, my brother and
[1:30:18] sister. Right. It's it's kind of scary
[1:30:21] because there's places on the earth
[1:30:23] today men that can preach and quote this
[1:30:25] message but they have moved in such a
[1:30:28] position that um a brother was just
[1:30:31] mentioning this me while we're in South
[1:30:32] Africa you know of men in different
[1:30:35] countries uh uh and they're they're
[1:30:37] preaching in such a way and convincing
[1:30:39] the people I'm that servant of God as it
[1:30:43] was that come to Abraham call me Lord
[1:30:46] now my brother and sister I'm sorry I
[1:30:48] want No, no part of that kind of a thing
[1:30:52] because I recognize that this man right
[1:30:54] here in this flesh in no wise would be
[1:30:57] worthy to stand and say call me Lord.
[1:31:00] Amen. So we recognize we have one Lord.
[1:31:04] Amen. Not three, not a dozen, one. Amen.
[1:31:09] So it's there uh that he comes and
[1:31:12] Abraham by revelation then goes and
[1:31:15] kills a calf has milk and everything
[1:31:18] that's necessary lays out the feast and
[1:31:20] it's there that it's a wonderful time
[1:31:23] and uh God didn't come down in that body
[1:31:27] once again Melchzdc he did not come down
[1:31:30] in that body just to ask Abraham hey is
[1:31:32] everything going okay but he was there
[1:31:35] to give the word to Abraham give
[1:31:38] direction to him. Now, we look at
[1:31:40] Abraham's decision just like we look at
[1:31:42] decisions in our own lives. Look at
[1:31:44] Abraham's decision, my brother and
[1:31:46] sister. He could have easily taken the
[1:31:48] position and said, "You know what? With
[1:31:50] my ministry, I could go down to to Sodom
[1:31:54] and I could make a difference." But you
[1:31:56] see, he recognized his position. My
[1:31:59] brother and sister, we were just talking
[1:32:01] a few minutes ago about letting our
[1:32:03] light shine to be an example. But you
[1:32:05] see, our ministry is not to try and go
[1:32:08] convince Sodom
[1:32:10] to change their ways. That's right. Our
[1:32:13] ministry is to live the word. And those
[1:32:16] that have the life or seed in them will
[1:32:19] be attracted to the word. That's right.
[1:32:21] Now, kind of hold that thought down the
[1:32:23] roadways. We'll come back to that. Now,
[1:32:25] as it is, my brother and sister, they
[1:32:27] sit there, the fatted calf, they eat,
[1:32:30] they drink, they fellowship, and and all
[1:32:33] of this is there, and it is the same
[1:32:37] thing again. This is God in a theophony
[1:32:43] theophic theophenic form. I'll get this
[1:32:47] right. Get tongue tied.
[1:32:50] It's God in a form. But God has such
[1:32:53] authority that in that form you can look
[1:32:57] on him. Yeah. You could touch him.
[1:33:02] He ate. He drank.
[1:33:07] Isn't that incredible? Yeah.
[1:33:11] He didn't come to Abraham and say, "Man,
[1:33:13] I need to take a nap."
[1:33:15] Just over the horizon right there. He
[1:33:18] just
[1:33:20] and walks into Abraham's life. Yeah. Now
[1:33:24] Abraham recognizes the
[1:33:27] presence of who he is with.
[1:33:31] This is the difference, my brother and
[1:33:33] sister. People will say, "Oh, I went to
[1:33:35] church and and the music moved
[1:33:39] me." Churches such as maybe I will name
[1:33:42] it. I don't mean to slight but music
[1:33:44] such as Hill Song uh that you know it's
[1:33:47] like a wave that rolled around the world
[1:33:50] with with their music and some of their
[1:33:53] songs were very anointed but a lot of
[1:33:55] their songs was just just really a
[1:33:57] worldly form put into a spiritual aspect
[1:34:00] and and so you know they say the music
[1:34:02] moved me and that's why I want to go
[1:34:04] like I like to go to that church just
[1:34:06] had a gentleman say something of that
[1:34:08] very nature to me just here recently he
[1:34:11] said you know this is the reason we go
[1:34:13] to church there, my brother and sister.
[1:34:15] But I'll tell you, God can reveal
[1:34:17] himself and his presence in music. But
[1:34:20] God has a way of showing that this music
[1:34:24] edifies him. It's not just because of
[1:34:26] music. So you can be moved in church by
[1:34:29] music and it not be the least bit of the
[1:34:31] Holy Spirit. And so we have to be
[1:34:34] careful, but let's not get paranoid.
[1:34:37] Oh, can I is it okay to put it that way?
[1:34:39] We can get so hypervigilant about a song
[1:34:43] that that oh that's just so wrong. But
[1:34:45] I'll tell you, we're sons and daughters
[1:34:47] of God and God will lay upon our hearts
[1:34:50] not to sing a song. Some songs have come
[1:34:53] right here in Grace Tabernacle through
[1:34:54] the years. We've sang them for a little
[1:34:56] short season and there was just
[1:34:58] seemingly something missing and those
[1:35:00] songs have disappeared from our worship
[1:35:04] because God without criticizing us or
[1:35:07] judging us or being harsh on us has just
[1:35:10] taken the desire for that music away. Is
[1:35:13] not is that not the way he deals with
[1:35:16] everything in our life that worldly
[1:35:18] things. We come out of the world, we get
[1:35:20] saved and we start to do this. Does God
[1:35:22] come and beat us with a club at the door
[1:35:25] and say, "What you did right there,
[1:35:26] never do it again?" No. What God does is
[1:35:29] he removes the desire for that out of
[1:35:32] our life. And so it's the same thing in
[1:35:34] things like music. Amen. That we as a
[1:35:37] body of believers, we as individuals,
[1:35:40] God comes and just removes. And
[1:35:42] sometimes it's strange enough, God uses
[1:35:45] time to remove desire. Amen. He doesn't
[1:35:48] always just at the snap of a finger just
[1:35:50] change everything. But he can and he
[1:35:53] does. But still in some cases God just
[1:35:56] lets time and the word come and the word
[1:35:59] then slowly takes the desire out of us.
[1:36:02] And as the desire disappears we don't
[1:36:05] even go, "Oh, I sure missed that song.
[1:36:08] The desire is gone. I love the way the
[1:36:12] Lord works." Amen. Otherwise, we just
[1:36:15] pass a great big book. Here's the Bible.
[1:36:18] Amen. This print of the Bible is about
[1:36:20] an inch and a half thick. And if we
[1:36:24] printed our rule book, it would take 10
[1:36:26] additions and boy 50 pounds because we'd
[1:36:29] have a rule and a subruule and a
[1:36:32] addendum to the rule for every single
[1:36:34] thing. But the reason this works, my
[1:36:36] brother and sister, is because this book
[1:36:38] brings the word, and the word is what
[1:36:41] takes the desire from us. Amen. Not
[1:36:44] man's dictate. And so God is dealing
[1:36:46] with Abraham and uh he comes there and
[1:36:49] he's dealing in this very personal way
[1:36:52] with him. And uh we see that in that
[1:36:55] time of the word coming in this
[1:36:57] theophenic body it the word coming is
[1:37:00] actually at a point that Abraham starts
[1:37:03] to realize how much his relationship
[1:37:06] with Lot has hindered him. It really
[1:37:10] soaks in that there is a difference
[1:37:13] between me and Lot. He's of my kindred.
[1:37:15] He's family. I felt an obligation to
[1:37:18] take care of him. But the word starts.
[1:37:20] And when you and I, if I could just put
[1:37:22] it this way, when you and I do the
[1:37:24] separation, we're going to just leave
[1:37:26] our family. There's trouble.
[1:37:30] It's a lot of trouble.
[1:37:32] But when God starts to bring a
[1:37:34] separation, they will as much or more
[1:37:37] than you say, you know, it's just fine
[1:37:40] if we go our separate ways.
[1:37:44] had no hard feelings. You can sit down
[1:37:45] as it would be, I don't know, over a
[1:37:47] supper and and enjoy their presence, but
[1:37:49] you realize the Lord is what brought
[1:37:51] that separation, not you coming. When I
[1:37:54] was a young man, it was all about give
[1:37:56] the word test. Uh, amen. See, families
[1:37:58] that used to be pretty close and no
[1:38:00] reason they could not remain close, but
[1:38:03] someone was anointed to give the word
[1:38:05] test and just offend everybody around
[1:38:08] them. It wasn't even It wasn't even a a
[1:38:11] true representation or presentation of
[1:38:14] the gospel. It was simply line up to
[1:38:16] this or you're serpent seed. Line up to
[1:38:20] this or you never was of God. Line up to
[1:38:23] this. My brother and sister, that's not
[1:38:25] how you win people.
[1:38:27] My my oh
[1:38:29] my. My oh
[1:38:31] my. But God, come down to Abraham's
[1:38:34] tent. And that body that was there
[1:38:37] seemed so
[1:38:39] real. Abraham would have told you that
[1:38:42] was the real thing. But the word says
[1:38:43] that no man's ever saw
[1:38:45] God. That's right. Even in dealing with
[1:38:49] Moses, he told him, "I'll cover your
[1:38:51] eyes and I'll show you my backside,
[1:38:54] but you won't look upon my face." So, we
[1:38:57] see that this here's the separation cuz
[1:39:00] people bring up questions. Such a lovely
[1:39:02] thing. I'll share this. Such a lovely
[1:39:03] thing. Uh sat uh I mean Sunday night.
[1:39:07] Sunday night preached my last sermon uh
[1:39:09] there at Nest Park. And as I'm I'm uh
[1:39:13] gathering my stuff, I was a little weary
[1:39:15] and body. I was gathering my stuff. I
[1:39:17] was walking out of the church and two of
[1:39:20] the most beautiful young ladies that you
[1:39:22] would ever meet in your life. Uh 11
[1:39:24] going on 12 years old. Just glowing
[1:39:27] young ladies. and and uh the one little
[1:39:29] sister just warmed my heart cuz just so
[1:39:32] happened where her family was sitting
[1:39:34] was kind of out in my line of sight and
[1:39:37] all through the service here's this
[1:39:38] little 12-year-old girl head down, hands
[1:39:41] up. Oh, she's just she's just digging
[1:39:44] into this and and it just warmed my
[1:39:46] heart because I don't believe it was a
[1:39:48] show. I don't believe it was something
[1:39:49] she was putting on. I believe it was a
[1:39:51] real relationship. Now, this little girl
[1:39:54] and her friend are there and you realize
[1:39:57] the one little girl that I just
[1:39:58] described in a sense is a little more
[1:40:00] spiritually mature and they're about the
[1:40:03] same age. They're best friends. And and
[1:40:06] she comes over very respectful. She lays
[1:40:09] her hand on my forearm and she says,
[1:40:11] "Brother Paul, can we talk to you?" I
[1:40:15] was like, "Of course, sweetheart. What
[1:40:17] What would you like?" Well, my
[1:40:22] friend, I have a friend in a journey.
[1:40:28] My friend has a need. I was like,
[1:40:32] okay. Well, really, it's a question. I
[1:40:36] was like, of course. We went back inside
[1:40:40] in the back of the convention hall or I
[1:40:42] guess what you would call it. You know,
[1:40:44] it's a uh maybe we'll be able in another
[1:40:46] service to share a picture of it. Great
[1:40:48] big building. Great big building. God's
[1:40:51] blessed them with. Um and we sat down on
[1:40:54] the back row right there and pulled the
[1:40:56] chairs around. It was interesting
[1:40:58] because I pulled out a chair and I a
[1:41:00] chair and I was going to sit on the the
[1:41:03] deal and the one little girl looked at
[1:41:05] me and says, "Could could we sit beside
[1:41:08] each
[1:41:10] other?" I think that's right
[1:41:13] reasonable. Okay, sweetheart. What's
[1:41:15] your
[1:41:19] question? God wants
[1:41:21] us, not just preachers.
[1:41:24] God wants us to be willing to get down
[1:41:28] on someone else's level. That's right.
[1:41:33] Easy as adults to say, "Okay, little
[1:41:35] girl, pat pat on the head. What's your
[1:41:38] problem?"
[1:41:40] But I have to tell you, God laid upon my
[1:41:41] heart. And I got right down and I'm
[1:41:43] sitting in a chair and I'm there and I'm
[1:41:45] looking right in their eyes and I says,
[1:41:48] "What's your question?"
[1:41:52] Broke my heart in a happy way. The
[1:41:54] little girl looks at me, looks at her
[1:41:55] friend, and her friend's nodding. You
[1:41:58] can do it. You can do it. Tell
[1:42:02] him, "Brother Paul, how do I get closer
[1:42:08] to the Lord?" Question.
[1:42:11] Awesome question.
[1:42:14] Awesome question.
[1:42:16] Oh, my brother and sister, I about burst
[1:42:18] into tears right there. That's right.
[1:42:21] little girl and her innocence there just
[1:42:24] wants to know how to get closer to God.
[1:42:28] So we went and we started before there
[1:42:30] was Stardust and we went here and we
[1:42:32] went there and went to the seals and we
[1:42:34] went through the church. No, no. I told
[1:42:37] her,
[1:42:39] "Sweetheart, go
[1:42:41] back. Go to the word of God as a
[1:42:44] 12year-old." That's right. Because she
[1:42:47] actually already had the answer. Yeah.
[1:42:50] But she was trying to think up with her
[1:42:53] elder siblings,
[1:42:55] with her parents, with what brother Paul
[1:42:59] just preached. She's trying to get up
[1:43:02] here to figure out how to do this. Go
[1:43:05] back. Read your Bible.
[1:43:08] You don't have to understand it. She
[1:43:10] brought that up. She says, "Well, I was
[1:43:11] reading my Bible. I just didn't
[1:43:13] understand what I was reading." Just
[1:43:14] read your Bible.
[1:43:16] Just read your Bible and pray. Well,
[1:43:20] brother Paul, I'm not sure if I'm
[1:43:21] praying correctly. The Holy Spirit will
[1:43:24] lead you. Just pray. Cuz you see, the
[1:43:27] worst thing we can do, saints, is try to
[1:43:29] get everybody conformed to a certain
[1:43:31] idea that you got to pray this way and
[1:43:33] you got to read X amount. You need to
[1:43:35] read three chapters of the Bible every
[1:43:39] day. And by the time you get to chapter
[1:43:41] three, you can't even remember what you
[1:43:42] read in chapter one.
[1:43:45] But that's what's going to do it. I told
[1:43:46] her, "Go back. Be a 12-year-old." Amen.
[1:43:49] Be a little girl that will lift your
[1:43:51] hand and worship the Lord and say,
[1:43:53] "Thank you, Lord, for saving my soul."
[1:43:56] And and you know, it's so lovely because
[1:43:58] the little girls, you know how kids can
[1:44:00] be. One question led to another question
[1:44:05] which led to another question. Even the
[1:44:08] little girl's mother is looking in like,
[1:44:10] "Where's my daughter?"
[1:44:13] But in the end, she looked me in the eye
[1:44:15] and said, "Thank you, brother Paul. I
[1:44:18] understand." And every minute of my
[1:44:21] time, one of the deacons was like,
[1:44:23] "Look, Brother Paul's tired. You guys
[1:44:25] are bothering." Nope, brother.
[1:44:28] Just let these little girls have their
[1:44:30] moment, these little sisters, to
[1:44:33] recognize they are as important in the
[1:44:35] kingdom of God as anyone else. Amen. I
[1:44:40] tell you, if the Lord ever grants for me
[1:44:42] to go back back to South Africa, I've
[1:44:44] got a couple friends. Amen. Even if the
[1:44:46] adults don't like me, those two little
[1:44:48] girls going to like me. Amen. They're
[1:44:50] sitting there. And you know what's
[1:44:52] difference? I'm not expecting you guys
[1:44:53] to go here. Don't misunderstand. But you
[1:44:55] know, they had no qualms to say they
[1:44:57] love me. And I had no qualm to be able
[1:44:59] to say I love you because it's that
[1:45:02] childlike innocence that Jesus was
[1:45:04] talking about. Come as a child. receive
[1:45:07] as a child and live as a child. Amen.
[1:45:12] So, here it is. God's moving. Now, this
[1:45:14] is the second time that we see that God
[1:45:16] coming down in Genesis and and I need to
[1:45:19] move along in the sermon. Who is this
[1:45:21] Melchzdc? Uh we'll see that if we put
[1:45:24] that up on the screen. Thank you. Uh
[1:45:27] Abraham said it was he said the name was
[1:45:29] he called him Elohim. Now, in Genesis 1,
[1:45:32] you'll find in the beginning Elohim
[1:45:34] created the heavens and the earth. In
[1:45:36] Genesis 18, we find out that Abraham
[1:45:38] called this person that sat there and
[1:45:40] talked to him and could tell him the
[1:45:42] secrets of his heart and tell him what
[1:45:44] Sarah was thinking behind him.
[1:45:46] Incredible. Come on, my brother and
[1:45:48] sister. And now I want to insert
[1:45:50] something right here if I could just
[1:45:52] expand this out. How many times have you
[1:45:55] had a need? How many times have you had
[1:45:57] a prayer? How many times have you read
[1:45:59] your Bible and you came to church and
[1:46:02] God? Now, come on. This is not the
[1:46:05] preacher speaking to you. This is God
[1:46:08] speaking to you. And the very scripture
[1:46:10] you've been reading, the very thoughts
[1:46:12] you've been having, God comes and speaks
[1:46:14] to you, my brother and sister. It's not
[1:46:16] brother soandso. It's Elohim. Amen. He's
[1:46:20] come right down in our midst and he's
[1:46:22] speaking to us and he's wanting us to
[1:46:24] know I hear and recognize your thoughts.
[1:46:29] Praise the Lord. Oh, help us, Lord.
[1:46:33] Amen. Let's not get into this. That
[1:46:35] brother, he spoke so hard. Had a little
[1:46:37] deal like this on our little journey
[1:46:39] here. Well, this is this way. I had a
[1:46:41] brother look me in the face and he makes
[1:46:43] a statement along that line. He says,
[1:46:45] "Brother Paul, I'm fully expecting you
[1:46:47] to tear the hide off of us." And I
[1:46:49] started to protest and he says, "But
[1:46:52] then by the word you'll come back and
[1:46:54] put a spiritual band-aid on it and we'll
[1:46:56] be better for it." And I was like, "Well
[1:46:59] put,
[1:47:00] brother. Well put." I don't know about
[1:47:02] the tearing the hide off of you, but
[1:47:04] God's got a spiritual band-aid that he
[1:47:07] puts over every wound that we have in
[1:47:09] our life. every disappointment, every
[1:47:11] discouragement, every moment that Satan
[1:47:14] would like to trip you, God's got the
[1:47:16] bandage to put over that so that Satan
[1:47:19] can't sit there and keep scratching that
[1:47:21] wound. Amen. And God comes without
[1:47:24] telling the
[1:47:25] preacher. I'm just sorry to interject
[1:47:28] this, but somebody's like, "It's as
[1:47:30] though, brother Paul, you knew what
[1:47:33] we've been talking about." And you know,
[1:47:35] I just was anointed. I was bold. I knew
[1:47:38] what you were talking about. And he
[1:47:40] looks at me and I said, "Yes, I'm
[1:47:42] standing in my shop at home and I'm
[1:47:44] working. Lord, do I go to South Africa
[1:47:46] or not?" And the Lord spoke to me, gave
[1:47:49] me these scriptures, gave me these
[1:47:51] thoughts, gave me this direction. Yes,
[1:47:54] somebody told me,
[1:47:57] but it wasn't man. Amen. Amen. Don't let
[1:48:01] me get
[1:48:02] sidetracked. Talk to him. could tone the
[1:48:04] secrets of his heart, tell him what
[1:48:06] Sarah was thinking behind him. Abraham
[1:48:08] said, "It is Elohim." He was in a
[1:48:10] theophony form. You get it? Notice now
[1:48:13] we find out that he was then in the
[1:48:15] theophony form. He called him Lord God
[1:48:17] Elohim. Now in Genesis 18, we find that
[1:48:20] is true.
[1:48:23] Amen. Now notice Abraham, it was three
[1:48:26] of them together, but when Abraham met
[1:48:27] the three, he said, "My Lord." Yes, he
[1:48:31] recognized there was one that was the
[1:48:34] one that he knew as Almighty God,
[1:48:39] Elohim. That one is my Lord. Oh,
[1:48:43] hallelujah.
[1:48:45] I think in some places in the world,
[1:48:47] they need to read this quote a little
[1:48:49] more. Amen. But when Lot down in Sodom,
[1:48:52] two of them went down there, and Lot saw
[1:48:54] the two of them coming, he said, "My
[1:48:57] lords." Yeah. See, without revelation,
[1:49:00] he just these are men of God, my lords.
[1:49:05] See, what was the matter the first
[1:49:06] place? Lot was not a prophet. That's
[1:49:08] right. Neither was he the messenger of
[1:49:10] the hour. So, he didn't have any
[1:49:12] revelation of him. Now, I want you to
[1:49:14] recognize how important it is what God's
[1:49:16] done. We are not prophets and we are not
[1:49:20] Wait, are we messengers
[1:49:23] of the hour? Amen.
[1:49:27] the
[1:49:28] spirit and the bride
[1:49:31] say come say come right we're a
[1:49:34] messenger see how God places us so
[1:49:37] carefully through a prophet's words that
[1:49:39] we can stand today and we can speak with
[1:49:42] authority if we'll give completely over
[1:49:45] to the Lord and allow him to have
[1:49:48] control of us you will find yourself
[1:49:50] speaking boldly like you've never spoke
[1:49:53] before
[1:49:54] because it's not you. Amen. Never was
[1:49:57] you, never will be you. But God says,
[1:49:59] "You are mine and the word." Well, I'll
[1:50:02] get ahead of myself. Amen. Let me just
[1:50:04] stop right here. Amen. So, he didn't
[1:50:07] have any revelation of him. It's exactly
[1:50:09] right. Lot could call them lords, a
[1:50:13] dozen of them. He could still lords, but
[1:50:15] no matter how many Abraham saw, it was
[1:50:17] still one Lord. There is God. There was
[1:50:21] the machzc.
[1:50:24] What a revelation. And Abraham just
[1:50:25] wasn't a a randomly chosen man. He was a
[1:50:28] man that was chosen to receive word in
[1:50:31] his hour to be able to be a
[1:50:34] representation or manifestation of that
[1:50:36] day. Now my brother and sister, I want
[1:50:38] you to understand God has placed you on
[1:50:41] the exact same level as he did Abraham
[1:50:45] because you have received the word.
[1:50:47] You've been given the authority to speak
[1:50:49] the word and the word has come out and
[1:50:51] it remains true. It always was true. It
[1:50:53] remains true. Even when it comes through
[1:50:55] your lips, it is true. We got to have
[1:50:58] the revelation. Understand that if God
[1:51:01] uses you to speak, that word is just as
[1:51:03] authority as it was with anyone else
[1:51:06] because it's God's authority, not our
[1:51:08] authority. Amen. Now, let me hurry up
[1:51:11] and get moved along here. I got way, way
[1:51:13] too much stuff there. It's obvious. So,
[1:51:16] he was there. God there in theophony
[1:51:18] form with Abraham and God then
[1:51:22] represented him. If you would ask
[1:51:24] Abraham or a carnal man at that time,
[1:51:26] you would have just said, "Well, that
[1:51:28] was a great man of God." They would not
[1:51:30] have recognized that was God.
[1:51:34] But here's God theophony form in flesh.
[1:51:38] Amen. The same, my brother and sister,
[1:51:41] that if we had been there, we could have
[1:51:43] shook his hand. We could have pinched
[1:51:45] his flesh. We could have said that's a
[1:51:49] man, but it was not a man. It was God in
[1:51:55] theophony. Now, I want to go back. Let
[1:51:57] me hurry back here. Back to John 1. The
[1:52:00] scripture says verse 14. And the word
[1:52:02] was made
[1:52:03] flesh, not
[1:52:05] theophony. The word now is literally in
[1:52:09] flesh.
[1:52:12] Otherwise, John 1:14 would have said,
[1:52:15] "And the word was made in a
[1:52:18] theophony, but it wasn't. It was literal
[1:52:21] flesh, just like you and I." Amen. God
[1:52:25] says, "I'm a lamb." And a lamb has to
[1:52:28] come as a true sacrifice. Not a
[1:52:30] theoretical lamb, not a theophony lamb,
[1:52:33] not a, you know, imaginary lamb. It's
[1:52:35] got to be a real lamb. and it's got to
[1:52:37] bleed and it's got to die for the
[1:52:39] sacrifice to be counted. And so he comes
[1:52:42] back and it's spoken there. Verse 14,
[1:52:46] the word became flesh. This is a this is
[1:52:48] a flesh that became weary, my brother
[1:52:50] and sister. This was a flesh that
[1:52:52] understood it. It says it faced every
[1:52:54] challenge. I know you've thought about
[1:52:56] this, but let me remind you of this. The
[1:52:59] word says it faced every challenge,
[1:53:01] every trial, every temptation,
[1:53:04] everything that you have ever faced in
[1:53:07] your life. Our Lord Jesus faced that.
[1:53:10] Amen. Even to come as it would be that
[1:53:12] I'm weary and welloing. And I think if
[1:53:14] we would be honest with ourselves, many
[1:53:16] times we as believers have come to a
[1:53:19] place that we are actually very weary
[1:53:21] and welloing. And and Satan says, "Look,
[1:53:24] they've left the screen door open." And
[1:53:26] we did that because we are so weary we
[1:53:28] forgot to close it. And he comes and
[1:53:30] then we wonder what's going on. But my
[1:53:32] brother and sister, our Lord Jesus was
[1:53:34] weary. Amen. Right. As much or more so
[1:53:37] than we've ever been weary.
[1:53:41] And so as we'll see what God is doing
[1:53:43] here. Amen. The flesh become weary had
[1:53:46] every attribute of our flesh. And if it
[1:53:50] had been God's goal to leave it in
[1:53:51] flesh, he would have left it in flesh.
[1:53:54] Mhm. But you see, nowhere through the
[1:53:57] scripture did he ever present himself to
[1:53:59] the people in flesh. It was always in a
[1:54:03] theophonyic form. And so now he's
[1:54:06] staying there in flesh because this come
[1:54:09] as a personal sacrifice. You know, this
[1:54:13] seems to be a little bold, a little
[1:54:15] whatever, but I don't know about you
[1:54:17] guys, but my lamb died at
[1:54:20] Calvary just for me. Amen. That's right.
[1:54:24] Now, we don't have to fight over that.
[1:54:27] There's enough blood to cover every
[1:54:28] issue, every sin, every discouragement.
[1:54:32] But you see, if you don't come to the
[1:54:34] place, if it's just out there almost
[1:54:36] like theory that he died for us, then
[1:54:39] he'll remain there. But when it becomes
[1:54:41] personal and you realize it was my sin
[1:54:44] that took him to the cross, God forgive
[1:54:47] me.
[1:54:48] Lord, forgive me. My sin took him to the
[1:54:51] cross. And it becomes so much more
[1:54:53] personal than the impersonal of a
[1:54:55] theory. I read it in the Bible and
[1:54:57] that's what happened. The lamb was slain
[1:54:59] before the foundation and God brought it
[1:55:01] down into a earth form so that we could
[1:55:03] relate to the suffering of it. Oh,
[1:55:05] praise God. I'm saved. No, my brother
[1:55:07] and sister, that ought to drive so deep
[1:55:09] down into our hearts and souls that God
[1:55:12] come and he did it just for me.
[1:55:16] Hallelujah. So, if it had been God's
[1:55:18] goal to remain in flesh, he would have
[1:55:19] stayed in flesh. Amen. He would have
[1:55:22] made a plan to remain in that physical
[1:55:24] body. And just bear with me for a minute
[1:55:27] here. Amen. I I'm I'm going a tad bit
[1:55:29] long. I hope that's okay. Amen. But look
[1:55:32] at this. How been God says,
[1:55:35] "Nope. I've stepped down into
[1:55:40] flesh. Not once, but multiple times."
[1:55:45] This wasn't new. Yeah. when he come down
[1:55:48] in the form of Jesus Christ, this wasn't
[1:55:52] new, right? God's well
[1:55:55] experienced. Only this time to make it
[1:55:58] so real instead of just appearing in as
[1:56:02] it would be a flesh form, he comes right
[1:56:05] down into the womb of a virgin and says,
[1:56:09] "I'm going to let them see it from the
[1:56:11] very start to the very finish." Amen.
[1:56:15] And here's Mary, a godly girl.
[1:56:19] Holy Ghost. You say, "But the Holy Ghost
[1:56:21] wasn't pre present then." It was. We
[1:56:25] just didn't identify it that way. And
[1:56:28] the Holy Ghost fil girl wanted to just
[1:56:30] live and do right for God. And while all
[1:56:33] of Israel had a a teenage girl, you
[1:56:36] might say, that was saying, "Oh, maybe
[1:56:38] our daughter will be the virgin."
[1:56:41] And Mary's just living the word. Yeah.
[1:56:44] And God said,
[1:56:47] "Mary, I've chosen you." Yeah. And we
[1:56:50] see that pretty soon she's got a baby
[1:56:53] bump. Yeah. Now, you can hide it. It's
[1:56:57] pretty funny. I I say this kindly.
[1:56:59] Please don't misunderstand. But to make
[1:57:00] a point, I always find it interesting
[1:57:03] when
[1:57:04] sisters Amen. they know they're
[1:57:06] pregnant. Husband knows they're
[1:57:08] pregnant. Maybe their children already
[1:57:10] know they're pregnant. They don't want
[1:57:12] you to
[1:57:13] know. And so it's interesting that that
[1:57:17] they can hide it for a season, but I'm
[1:57:20] telling you, when the baby bump gets out
[1:57:22] here, there's no hiding it. Amen.
[1:57:26] There's no way to camouflage what's
[1:57:28] happened there. And boy, the minute that
[1:57:32] Mary come to that stage, the world just
[1:57:34] blew up. the internet, all of social
[1:57:38] media, everything was there. Did you
[1:57:41] know that Mary and Joseph have been,
[1:57:45] "Well, we can't even talk about this."
[1:57:48] God said, "I don't care." Because I'm
[1:57:51] going to come and no matter how you view
[1:57:54] the lamb, it's still your lamb. Amen.
[1:58:00] And the world viewed that lamb as be
[1:58:03] elabub.
[1:58:05] But not you. That's right. Praise God.
[1:58:08] You viewed that lamb as your redemption.
[1:58:12] You saw that. So God comes in that form.
[1:58:15] Amen. As it is. See, God had already
[1:58:18] presented a pattern, my brother and
[1:58:19] sister. And you can find you have
[1:58:21] questions about things in your life. Go
[1:58:23] take those patterns into your Bible.
[1:58:26] Don't sit there and get nervous about it
[1:58:28] and and moan and cry and whine. Go look
[1:58:31] for the patterns through the word
[1:58:32] because God works in patterns just like
[1:58:34] he works through families. Amen. People
[1:58:37] are like, "Well, it's an individual
[1:58:39] affair, but God seems to work in
[1:58:40] families." That's exactly right. God
[1:58:42] places a seed in there and he placed it
[1:58:44] down there with Abraham and said to your
[1:58:47] families, I'm just paraphrasing it. And
[1:58:49] to your children's children and your
[1:58:51] children's children and your children's
[1:58:53] children, as many as far off. Amen.
[1:58:56] Amen.
[1:58:57] He didn't say, "Well, we'll just
[1:59:00] sprinkle it out here." He put it right
[1:59:02] in there and said, "To you and to your
[1:59:04] children and your children and your
[1:59:06] children and your children and your
[1:59:08] children." That's right. Oh, thank you,
[1:59:09] Lord. Thank you,
[1:59:11] Lord.
[1:59:13] So, he goes there,
[1:59:17] crucifixion. This is close as I'm going
[1:59:18] to get to an Easter sermon to you
[1:59:20] saints. So,
[1:59:21] crucifixion. Amen. How stunning that
[1:59:24] must have been to all the believers of
[1:59:27] that time. Amen. They they thought
[1:59:29] literally as it was on the road to
[1:59:30] Emmas, they thought he was to be our
[1:59:32] redeemer. He was to be our deliverer. He
[1:59:35] was to conquer the enemy and set us
[1:59:37] free. And little did they know exactly
[1:59:40] that's what was taking place. And in
[1:59:42] that realm, they they're just stunned by
[1:59:44] the very fact that that Jesus Christ.
[1:59:46] And some of them must have said, "Maybe
[1:59:48] those people were right. Maybe that
[1:59:50] wasn't the son of God. Maybe that wasn't
[1:59:53] the Messiah, the redeemer. I just don't
[1:59:56] know. But he comes and he appears on the
[1:59:59] road to Emmas in such a fashion he
[2:00:03] walked with them and they didn't even
[2:00:06] know him. Now I want to ask you, does he
[2:00:09] not do the same to us? Amen. How many
[2:00:11] times of our life is he right there with
[2:00:14] us? Amen. And all we can be is sad.
[2:00:21] Yep.
[2:00:28] Well, praise
[2:00:30] God. The Lord anointed Emanuel Gospel
[2:00:33] Center to be able to say amen to that.
[2:00:36] Yeah.
[2:00:37] You got the same God that stood with the
[2:00:39] prophet. Yeah. Same God from the
[2:00:42] foundation of the world. Let me back up
[2:00:43] a little bit. Same God that's come all
[2:00:45] the way through the Bible. He stood with
[2:00:47] every one of those messengers. Every one
[2:00:49] of those apostles. He stood with them.
[2:00:51] He's answered prayer. He's proven his
[2:00:53] word. And he's come right down and stood
[2:00:55] in our generation with a prophet and
[2:00:57] proved that it was the word for the day.
[2:00:59] And he's standing right with us. And
[2:01:01] we're sad.
[2:01:02] God help us. God help us. I don't care
[2:01:05] if the wheels fall off your wagon. You
[2:01:07] should be able to say, "Lord, you're in
[2:01:08] control and I'm going to trust you,
[2:01:10] Lord. Cuz if I'm not trusting you, I
[2:01:13] have nothing else. I've got nothing else
[2:01:15] to go back to. I've got nowhere to go.
[2:01:18] In fact, it's not just for me. There is
[2:01:21] nowhere to go. Because if there was, my
[2:01:24] brother and sister, it would be known
[2:01:25] around the world and it would be there
[2:01:27] that you could go find something
[2:01:29] greater. But God said, "I'm not going to
[2:01:32] make this a great worldwide missionary
[2:01:35] thing. I'm not going to make it some
[2:01:37] great movement with great cathedrals and
[2:01:39] and it is because God said, "I'm going
[2:01:42] to bring it down and I'm just going to
[2:01:44] show myself to you." Amen.
[2:01:47] Amen. Critics are like, "Well, they have
[2:01:50] no organization. They have nothing to
[2:01:52] come together. They have no movement to
[2:01:54] really follow. They're just a bunch of
[2:01:55] disorganized people just exactly as they
[2:01:58] was on the day of Pentecost." Amen. They
[2:02:01] didn't walk out of the upper room
[2:02:02] saying, "Now, brother, what did you say
[2:02:04] we're supposed to do next?"
[2:02:07] Was I speaking in tongues or was I
[2:02:09] worshiping or what was I supposed to do?
[2:02:12] Show Show me again. Amen. I I appreciate
[2:02:15] the brothers. They did this. But when I
[2:02:16] got to South Africa, they hand me a
[2:02:18] paper clear full and they said, "Brother
[2:02:20] Paul, this is what your what your
[2:02:22] schedule is or as they say it
[2:02:29] sils in there, but otherwise it
[2:02:33] was No, that's not how God works. God
[2:02:37] says, you come prayed up to church and
[2:02:39] I'll come down and I'll speak to you and
[2:02:41] I'll bless you. You walk out of service
[2:02:44] today blessed because you came expecting
[2:02:47] to be blessed. And if you came to church
[2:02:49] today to fulfill some kind of
[2:02:51] traditional thing that we're supposed to
[2:02:53] go to church, you'll walk out of it with
[2:02:55] that box checked and that's all you'll
[2:02:57] walk out with. Yeah. But if we'll come
[2:03:00] with expectation, God says, "I'll meet
[2:03:02] you there." And we can say amen to that
[2:03:04] today. Amen. So now he's there in the
[2:03:08] resurrection. He he goes he he dies on
[2:03:11] the cross. It's real. He goes in the
[2:03:13] tomb. But in three days, those dear
[2:03:15] sisters, you know why he didn't use
[2:03:17] men? Because we just sat there and said,
[2:03:19] "Now, what are the odds? What's the
[2:03:21] factor? What's this times this formula
[2:03:24] times point and divide this?" And
[2:03:27] just the odds really come up against
[2:03:30] it. I've heard men say, "Our sisters are
[2:03:33] so
[2:03:35] gullible."
[2:03:37] Really? God thinks they're pretty
[2:03:39] spiritual, actually. Yeah.
[2:03:44] Oh, but it was Eve. The female got
[2:03:47] deceived is also the ones he revealed
[2:03:49] himself to. Yeah. Over and over and over
[2:03:54] and over again. And it was only after
[2:03:58] the sisters testimony that the tomb is
[2:04:00] empty. The brothers got off their chair.
[2:04:03] Now this I'm repeating somebody else's
[2:04:05] words and I think it's quite
[2:04:06] interesting. It was only after those
[2:04:08] sisters come back and said, "The tomb,
[2:04:10] the stone is rolled away. The tomb is
[2:04:12] empty." That the brothers bothered to
[2:04:13] get up from breakfast.
[2:04:17] A little bit rough, but it kind of
[2:04:19] describes. I think it describes anyway.
[2:04:22] Amen, brothers. Forgive me if you didn't
[2:04:25] agree. That kind of seems to be what we
[2:04:27] was. Amen. They were up at sunrise.
[2:04:31] They were there to check the tomb out.
[2:04:32] Yeah. And we were there to remind them
[2:04:34] we like our eggs over easy.
[2:04:40] Ah, well, you know, I wouldn't say it's
[2:04:43] gospel, but there's always another
[2:04:45] perspective out there. So, he reappears
[2:04:50] on the road to Emmas. What form was he
[2:04:53] in?
[2:04:54] That's it. Melchzdc once again, right?
[2:05:00] He was not a ghost.
[2:05:03] In fact, he was in the process of
[2:05:04] breaking bread. when they realized who
[2:05:08] he was.
[2:05:09] Amen. Spirit would have no need to break
[2:05:13] bread.
[2:05:16] But it was there and that that revealed
[2:05:18] to them. So here he is once again
[2:05:20] revealed in the form of Melchzdc.
[2:05:23] Amen. Yeah. Now adoption.
[2:05:27] Amen.
[2:05:29] Now one day when this lamb come, this
[2:05:32] man Satan was even fooled. I like this.
[2:05:34] He looked around him. He said, "If thou
[2:05:37] be the son of God, do this. If thou be
[2:05:39] the son of God, perform a miracle. Let
[2:05:40] me see you do it. Let me see you do it."
[2:05:42] Uh-huh. I'll tie a rag around his face
[2:05:45] and spite him. And if you're a prophet,
[2:05:47] tell us who hit you. Hm. I don't believe
[2:05:49] you're the guy. If you are, tell us
[2:05:51] straightly how you are. See, all like
[2:05:53] that. Oh, tell us you are. He opened not
[2:05:56] his mouth. Oh, did pull a wool over his
[2:06:00] eyes. Talking about pulling it over
[2:06:01] Satan. He looked around to the disciple
[2:06:04] and said, "I can only speak to my father
[2:06:06] and he'd send me 12 legions of angels if
[2:06:09] I wanted." Pilate didn't hear that.
[2:06:13] Amen. So God speaking in such a fashion.
[2:06:16] See, Pilate didn't even realize, I
[2:06:18] believe Pilate would have trembled in
[2:06:20] his shoes to judge the Christ. Amen. If
[2:06:24] he realized that all of this could be
[2:06:26] decimated in a moment by just a word.
[2:06:28] That's right. Look at this. Okay. Uh, if
[2:06:33] um, yeah, thank you. If thou be, if thou
[2:06:37] be. Oh, that ain't him. Why, look at him
[2:06:40] bleeding. Hey, some of you soldiers go
[2:06:42] over there and spit in his face. Spit
[2:06:44] and mocked him. Pulled handfuls of beard
[2:06:46] out of his face. Oh, he ain't no that
[2:06:48] ain't him. I'll anchor my stinger in
[2:06:50] him, boy. I'll get him there. I got you
[2:06:53] now. And when he last cried, Eli, Eli,
[2:06:56] my God, my God. That was a man.
[2:07:01] And we all know this. We're just just to
[2:07:03] stir up our pure minds here. Why hast
[2:07:05] thou forsaken me? That's exactly the
[2:07:08] reaction that a physical man would have
[2:07:11] in that circumstance. Amen. My brother
[2:07:14] and sister, if you read the history of
[2:07:15] the church in the dark ages, Amen. They
[2:07:18] tortured those uh believers, those
[2:07:20] saints. Uh they tortured them in such
[2:07:22] fashion. And those saints, many of them
[2:07:25] begged for them to stop. And they said,
[2:07:28] "We'll stop if you renounce Christ."
[2:07:30] They had no answer because they're not
[2:07:32] going to renounce Christ. The body, the
[2:07:34] physical man was saying, "Stop the
[2:07:37] pain."
[2:07:38] But the spiritual man said, "I can't go
[2:07:42] back.
[2:07:43] I cannot go back. This is who I am." And
[2:07:48] they went on to give their life. Amen.
[2:07:51] Oh, I tell you, God is so
[2:07:53] awesome. Amen. That was a man. Why hast
[2:07:56] thou forsaken me? In the garden of
[2:07:57] Gethsemane, the anointing left him. You
[2:08:00] know, he had to die as a sinner. He died
[2:08:02] a sinner. You know that. Not his sins,
[2:08:04] but mine and yours. That's where that
[2:08:07] love come in. How he took mine. Oh,
[2:08:10] hallelujah. How he took mine and there
[2:08:13] he was. He couldn't open his
[2:08:16] mouth. Get this, my brother and sister.
[2:08:19] He couldn't open his mouth. Stinger
[2:08:22] said, you know, I believe that was just
[2:08:24] an ordinary man. He wasn't virgin born
[2:08:26] for I anchored my stinger in him.
[2:08:30] I want to ask you here as we go on. Take
[2:08:33] up that next one if you would. Okay. And
[2:08:36] um but that was let me just I'm got two
[2:08:40] conflicting thoughts. My brother and
[2:08:42] sister just I want you to look at this.
[2:08:44] Have we ever come to the place our flesh
[2:08:47] said
[2:08:49] and we would look back and say Lord
[2:08:51] forgive me. It seemed like I But I want
[2:08:54] you to understand that's exactly the
[2:08:55] same position Jesus was in. His flesh
[2:08:58] was crying out. Yes. But God closed his
[2:09:02] mouth. Yeah.
[2:09:05] He could only say what God wanted him to
[2:09:09] say. Cuz you see, he's now back into our
[2:09:13] form. He's not there in theophinic form.
[2:09:16] He's not there as the King of Kings, the
[2:09:19] Lord of Lords. He's there now in a
[2:09:22] physical form.
[2:09:24] You see, the power of the theophony had
[2:09:28] been pulled from the physical body and
[2:09:31] was waiting just on the other side.
[2:09:37] Are you with me? I I think to me it's
[2:09:40] just so incredible. I think it's so
[2:09:42] incredible.
[2:09:46] Amen. Let me
[2:09:47] hurry. Amen.
[2:09:50] But that was the wrong time. Boy, right?
[2:09:52] Satan stuck his stinger in there. He got
[2:09:54] his stinger pulled out. Then he can't
[2:09:56] sting no more from then. He left his
[2:09:58] stinger in there. Rose up on the third
[2:10:00] day and said, "I am he that was dead and
[2:10:02] alive again and alive forever more. I
[2:10:04] have the keys of death and hell." Yes,
[2:10:07] sir. He failed to see who he was. And
[2:10:12] because I live, you shall live also. It
[2:10:14] does not appear yet. One day, 3 or 4
[2:10:18] days after that, after he had to ascend
[2:10:20] to the father, had returned back, some
[2:10:22] said, "Oh, he must be a spook. Must be
[2:10:25] some kind of something spooky about that
[2:10:28] guy. I You've seen him. You see the
[2:10:31] vision?" No, it was a real Jesus.
[2:10:34] See how God changes in and morphs
[2:10:37] himself any way he please. He'll appear
[2:10:40] in a theophanic form. He will put
[2:10:42] himself in flesh and appear that way.
[2:10:45] It's how God chooses to. We can't put
[2:10:48] him in a box of this is the way God must
[2:10:51] show himself or appear to us. Amen. So,
[2:10:54] it's there. He was a real Jesus. Thomas
[2:10:56] said, "Let me see his hands and
[2:10:57] everything and I'll tell you if it is."
[2:11:00] We're We're getting closer. This is a
[2:11:01] long quote. I'm sorry, but I just didn't
[2:11:03] know where to cut it off. Amen. He said,
[2:11:05] "Here I am. You got any fish and bread
[2:11:08] over there? Bring me a sandwich." And
[2:11:09] they brought him a sandwich and he stood
[2:11:11] there and eat it and said, "Now, does a
[2:11:13] spirit eat like I eat? Does a spirit
[2:11:15] have flesh and bones like I've got? See,
[2:11:18] I am he. I'm that. And Paul said it does
[2:11:21] not yet appear just exactly what kind of
[2:11:25] body we'll
[2:11:28] have. But but brother Paul,
[2:11:31] uh, no, no,
[2:11:34] no. Don't break the punchline, Paul.
[2:11:37] Stop. Stop.
[2:11:42] Yeah, we'll have a body. We don't know
[2:11:44] what kind of body we'll have, but we
[2:11:45] know we'll have a body like his. Now,
[2:11:48] this could get confusing if you don't
[2:11:50] approach it in the right way. Which body
[2:11:52] like
[2:11:55] him? Body before
[2:11:58] crucifixion, body after
[2:12:01] crucifixion, body like come to Abram or
[2:12:04] a body like come to Abraham?
[2:12:07] What body will we have? saints. Yeah, it
[2:12:11] doesn't really matter, does it? I've
[2:12:13] heard theologians, I've studied this out
[2:12:15] a little bit, heard theologians argue
[2:12:17] their points, but let's bring it simple.
[2:12:20] He said we would have a body like him.
[2:12:23] That's all that matters. Amen. I don't
[2:12:26] matter, my brother and sister, you know,
[2:12:28] exactly how you want to express it, how
[2:12:31] you want to go about it. I have a
[2:12:33] promise in the word. I'll have a body
[2:12:35] just like him. So as he is, so will we
[2:12:38] be. Amen. We can argue the theology of
[2:12:42] it, my brother and sister. That won't
[2:12:44] change the fact that we'll be like him.
[2:12:47] Amen. What do you ever have a Did he
[2:12:50] ever have that theophony body? Yes, sir.
[2:12:53] And when he died, the Bible said he a
[2:12:55] personal program out again. He went to
[2:12:57] hell and preached the souls in prison.
[2:12:59] Hallelujah. How did he do that? He had
[2:13:01] senses of feeling. He had senses of
[2:13:03] hearing. He had senses of speech. He
[2:13:05] preached with that same kind of body. I
[2:13:08] saw those glorified ones in the other
[2:13:10] night. He preached to the souls that
[2:13:12] were in hell that repented not in the
[2:13:15] long suffering of the days of Noah.
[2:13:17] Amen. Oh my brother and sister, look at
[2:13:20] that. Hallelujah. Amen. But when he rose
[2:13:24] up on Easter, it was not possible that
[2:13:27] that body should see corruption. Amen.
[2:13:31] Hallelujah. We got a body like his. You
[2:13:33] say, "But you know, look, our loved ones
[2:13:35] went in the grave and their bodies
[2:13:36] corrupted." That wasn't really them.
[2:13:39] That was a car that God gave them to
[2:13:41] drive on this earthly on this
[2:13:43] terrestrial world that we live in. That
[2:13:45] wasn't them. That was just a body, a car
[2:13:49] that God gave them to transport in.
[2:13:52] Amen. It's not possible the body should
[2:13:54] see corruption because David the prophet
[2:13:56] foresaw, I'll not leave his soul in
[2:13:58] hell, neither will I suffer my holy one
[2:14:00] to see corruption. Moreover, my flesh
[2:14:02] shall rest in hope because he'll not
[2:14:04] leave my soul in hell. Neither will he
[2:14:06] leave my holy one to see corruption. 72
[2:14:09] hours before corruption sets in. That
[2:14:11] theophony, that body that went and
[2:14:13] preached to the souls were in prison
[2:14:15] that repented not in the long-suffering
[2:14:17] days of Moses. Mos Noah rose again and
[2:14:20] mortal put on immortality and he stood
[2:14:23] and he and he told us that he was a man.
[2:14:26] Hallelujah. Amen. Wow. How do we balance
[2:14:30] this? We balance this because our God
[2:14:33] can do anything he wants to do. He's not
[2:14:36] bound by our theology. Amen. While
[2:14:38] they're saying, "Well, the trinities are
[2:14:40] true because this scripture says like
[2:14:42] this and he pronounced it like that and
[2:14:44] he did it this." Amen. The word says, "I
[2:14:47] am God, one God." Amen. Amen. Not three.
[2:14:50] I'm not divided up. Amen. And no matter
[2:14:53] how they try to explain it, the reason
[2:14:55] they explain it like they do is they've
[2:14:58] never met him in personal. And if they'd
[2:15:00] met him in person, they'd realize one
[2:15:02] God. Amen. But it's there. Education,
[2:15:06] theology, intellect. Amen. Not personal.
[2:15:10] That's right. Oh, hallelujah.
[2:15:15] Amen. My wife says I got to quit asking
[2:15:17] for more time and just take it.
[2:15:21] I'm trying.
[2:15:22] See, the Lord's changing our thinking.
[2:15:24] We are not thinking like flesh men
[2:15:27] anymore. Can someone say a amen to that?
[2:15:31] Because if we were, we'd be just
[2:15:32] confused as the rest of the world. But
[2:15:34] you see, we're being pulled out of this
[2:15:36] old carnal body, being pulled pulled out
[2:15:38] of this fleshly understanding,
[2:15:40] everything about the flesh controlling
[2:15:42] us. We get tired. Amen. I was going to
[2:15:45] go visiting the other night. I was just
[2:15:47] convinced. I even told sister Jerry, you
[2:15:49] know, I want to go visiting. A and uh
[2:15:51] you know, by the time I got off work, it
[2:15:53] was about 6:30, 6:45. And by the time I
[2:15:56] got off work, it was all I could do to
[2:15:58] drag myself in the house, take a shower,
[2:16:00] eat a bite, and fall in bed. And you
[2:16:02] know what? My mind was telling me, "Do
[2:16:03] it anyway." My body was saying, "Don't
[2:16:06] you
[2:16:07] dare." But you see, we're going to step
[2:16:09] beyond that realm, my brother and
[2:16:11] sister. No longer controlled by the
[2:16:13] mind. No longer controlled by the body,
[2:16:16] but controlled by the spirit.
[2:16:19] Hallelujah. Amen. We're no longer
[2:16:21] looking at the flesh man. I don't even
[2:16:22] trust this flesh man anymore. Amen.
[2:16:24] Amen. See, we're looking beyond our
[2:16:26] flesh into heavenly places. Amen. See
[2:16:29] what he's doing? He's bringing us from
[2:16:31] being earthbound. He's breaking us loose
[2:16:34] a root at a time. Can someone say amen
[2:16:36] to that? A root at a time. He's breaking
[2:16:38] us loose. Just as I was sharing earlier
[2:16:41] about changing the church, maybe about
[2:16:43] music or about something. You know, God
[2:16:46] doesn't come with an axe and just start
[2:16:47] doing it. John says he lays the axe to
[2:16:50] the root of the tree. But when we come
[2:16:51] back, we'll find the Holy Spirit as the
[2:16:53] prophet taught us is a gentleman. Amen.
[2:16:56] He doesn't come with an axe and start
[2:16:57] just slaughtering you. He comes and
[2:17:00] persuades us by the word. And the
[2:17:02] reaction of our own soul, the seed in
[2:17:04] us, to that word causes us to start
[2:17:07] changing because we are drawn to the
[2:17:09] light. That's right. We've done that
[2:17:11] before, right? We did it with the kids.
[2:17:13] A little thing about putting a corn
[2:17:15] seed, Amen. in a deal and putting it in
[2:17:17] the window and I don't remember which
[2:17:19] one of uh of the kids uh had had their
[2:17:22] corn plant in the window and and
[2:17:24] whatnot, you know. And and it's an
[2:17:26] interesting experiment cuz when that
[2:17:28] plant gets up about this big and you got
[2:17:30] it in a window and it starts to lean to
[2:17:32] the glass
[2:17:34] and then you can turn it around and it
[2:17:36] will lean the other way because the seed
[2:17:39] has something in it drawn to the light.
[2:17:42] Amen. And and I'll tell you, if you get
[2:17:44] pushed one way in this world, you get
[2:17:45] pushed in another way in this world,
[2:17:47] you'll find yourself leaning back to the
[2:17:49] light every single time because the seed
[2:17:52] gene of God is in you. Hallelujah. Amen.
[2:17:56] He's drawing us into heavenly places
[2:17:58] with a heavenly vision. That's why the
[2:18:00] things of this world no longer have
[2:18:02] their control on us. Now, some have
[2:18:04] tried to convince that we are angelic
[2:18:07] beings. That was a little something
[2:18:08] passed through the message here a few
[2:18:10] years ago and a little of it still
[2:18:12] lingers that that we are actually
[2:18:14] angelic beings. But my brother and
[2:18:15] sister, that's not the word. That's not
[2:18:17] the truth. Because angelic beings never
[2:18:20] sinned. Now some fell, right? But they
[2:18:22] did not come back in repentance. So
[2:18:25] angelic beings we've never known sin. We
[2:18:27] would not know nothing about that's not
[2:18:29] us. Amen. Angelic beings, my brother and
[2:18:32] sister, will never stand and be able to
[2:18:35] sing amazing grace from their heart.
[2:18:37] Amen. They'll never ever be able to
[2:18:40] stand before Almighty God. They praise
[2:18:42] him. They worship him, but it's a
[2:18:44] different praise, a different worship
[2:18:46] because they've never experienced what
[2:18:48] we experience. And we are there from the
[2:18:51] very depths of our heart. When we say
[2:18:53] holy, holy, praise unto the Lord. It's a
[2:18:56] little bit different than angelic
[2:18:58] beings. Amen. because we have been lost
[2:19:01] and been redeemed. And yet even that my
[2:19:04] brother and sister, we understand that
[2:19:06] God spoke our name. Amen. As those
[2:19:09] patriarchs mothers were birthing them in
[2:19:11] the beginning and cried out those names,
[2:19:13] they were positionally placed in the
[2:19:15] kingdom and God spoke our name as we
[2:19:18] were birthed by the word and come forth.
[2:19:21] He spoke our name and that positionally
[2:19:23] placed us as the bride of Christ. Not
[2:19:26] just someone who believes in him, but he
[2:19:28] positionally placed us as the bride of
[2:19:31] Christ at that time. Oh, I say thank
[2:19:35] you, Lord. Hallelujah. Amen. Amen. You
[2:19:39] see, the word wants us to look beyond
[2:19:41] this flesh. Amen. And see who we really
[2:19:43] are. That's right. Now, one last quote,
[2:19:46] I think. Nope. Oh, they just keep
[2:19:49] appearing
[2:19:50] here. Oh my. We'll hurry. see the
[2:19:54] discrepancy. But we find out God gave
[2:19:56] his children his
[2:19:58] word to condemn them. No,
[2:20:03] some people act that way. Yeah. The
[2:20:05] preacher read some quotes, read a
[2:20:07] scripture, and I just felt horrible.
[2:20:09] Really? You should have felt liberty.
[2:20:11] Yeah. God was talking about you.
[2:20:16] Yeah. We find out God gave his children
[2:20:19] his word for their defense. They have no
[2:20:21] other defense than the word of God. That
[2:20:24] is our defense. There's no bombs, no
[2:20:25] shelter, no hiding place, no Arizona or
[2:20:28] California or wherever it is. There's
[2:20:29] only one defense we have and that is the
[2:20:31] word. And the word was made flesh and
[2:20:34] dwelt among us, which is Christ Jesus.
[2:20:37] He is our only defense. Being in him, we
[2:20:42] are safe. Can we say amen to that? Amen.
[2:20:45] Being in him, we are safe. Amen.
[2:20:49] Hallelujah. Amen.
[2:20:52] Not even sin is imputed to the genuine
[2:20:54] believer. Did you know that? He that's
[2:20:57] born of God does not commit sin. He
[2:20:59] cannot sin. See, it's not even imputed.
[2:21:01] Why? David said, "Blessed is the man who
[2:21:04] God will not impute sin." And we sit
[2:21:06] here and say, "I said this and I did
[2:21:08] this and I thought this and I don't know
[2:21:10] that I can even go to church and I don't
[2:21:12] know that I can even because of this
[2:21:14] thing right here." That's nothing but a
[2:21:16] lie of the devil. God looked at you and
[2:21:19] said, "That's my son. That's my
[2:21:21] daughter. I won't even hold that to
[2:21:24] their account." Oh, but what about the
[2:21:27] book? The prophet God talks about it all
[2:21:29] being wrote in there. God's got a book
[2:21:31] for you. He's got a book for me. And in
[2:21:34] there, it says, "Covered by the blood,
[2:21:36] forgiven." Amen. My brother and sister,
[2:21:39] you see what God is doing? It doesn't
[2:21:41] give us license to sin.
[2:21:44] But it also gives us freedom from
[2:21:46] condemnation. That's right. No longer
[2:21:48] controlled by I was this and I was that.
[2:21:51] I love that. Sorry to deviate here. Take
[2:21:54] your time. But but look at this. Now,
[2:21:56] here's this
[2:21:58] man, Bud
[2:22:00] Southwick. They're up in British
[2:22:03] Columbia. And Bud Bud had a ritual.
[2:22:06] Seemed perfectly normal to me, right?
[2:22:09] We're there hunting. Just imagine now
[2:22:10] you're there hunting. And brother Bud
[2:22:14] right there in the evening, late in the
[2:22:16] evening, says, "Well, brothers, I guess
[2:22:20] I'll go out and check the
[2:22:23] horses." Seems perfectly reasonable,
[2:22:26] right? There's bears and mountain lions,
[2:22:28] and you don't want a horse getting loose
[2:22:30] and wandering away. And so he goes and
[2:22:33] he goes out and he checks the horses.
[2:22:38] Last time I was around anybody that
[2:22:42] smoked, they usually smell like a
[2:22:44] chimney when they come back. So, usually
[2:22:47] they're only fooling themselves. That's
[2:22:50] right.
[2:22:52] But God said, "Hm, you rotten no good
[2:22:55] sinner, Bud Southwick, prophet of God's
[2:22:59] going to rip the hide off of you today
[2:23:01] and straighten your life
[2:23:04] out." No. God looked down on the heart
[2:23:06] of that man. Amen. A man that was a
[2:23:10] rough rough man in a rough rough world.
[2:23:14] And he says, "I guess I'll better check
[2:23:16] the horses." And he's standing out there
[2:23:19] by the horses. And now there's brothers
[2:23:21] that knew Brother Bud Southwick
[2:23:23] personally. And Brother Bud wasn't a
[2:23:25] foolish
[2:23:28] man. The breeze is blowing that
[2:23:30] direction.
[2:23:37] Brother
[2:23:39] Bud. Yes, brother
[2:23:42] Bill. When did you give up
[2:23:46] smoking? That's an old story, my brother
[2:23:48] and sister. But let's just look at the
[2:23:50] reality of
[2:23:52] that. It wasn't, "Bud, why are you still
[2:23:56] smoking? You say you believe.
[2:24:02] And then look what words God anointed
[2:24:05] him to say. That's right. Just now,
[2:24:10] Brother Bill. That's right.
[2:24:13] See, there was a time and a place. Amen.
[2:24:18] Because God is perfect. Amen. In his
[2:24:20] time and his place. And he never smoked
[2:24:25] another cigarette again in his life.
[2:24:28] Amen.
[2:24:31] Oh, I want a God. I want to serve a God
[2:24:34] like that.
[2:24:36] Amen.
[2:24:38] Yeah.
[2:24:41] Amen. Blessed is the man. God will not
[2:24:44] impute sin. When you're in Christ, you
[2:24:45] have no desire to sin. But that doesn't
[2:24:47] mean you won't sin. See, some people
[2:24:49] read that and say, "Well, I I shouldn't
[2:24:51] have any desire. You I shouldn't that I
[2:24:53] shouldn't. Why?" But you got to
[2:24:55] understand God's talking about what?
[2:24:57] here or here.
[2:25:02] See, people get confused. They they no
[2:25:04] desire. I still I have a problem with
[2:25:07] this. Whatever it might be, I have a
[2:25:09] problem with this. That doesn't mean
[2:25:11] your heart desired it. That means your
[2:25:14] flesh hasn't been conquered yet. And
[2:25:17] God's on your way. I I didn't include
[2:25:19] the quote to cover that, but if you need
[2:25:21] to see it, I'll I'll I'll bring it. It's
[2:25:24] It's there. Yes. Amen. So when you're in
[2:25:27] Christ, you have no desire. The
[2:25:28] worshipper once purge has no more
[2:25:30] conscious of sin. You don't desire it.
[2:25:32] Now to the world, you might be a sinner.
[2:25:34] But to God, you're not because you're in
[2:25:36] Christ. How can you be a sinner when
[2:25:38] you're in the sinless one? In see, not
[2:25:41] close to, not in the same building with
[2:25:43] when you're in the sinless one. And God
[2:25:46] only sees him when you are in. See, only
[2:25:50] sees him who you are in. Amen. Amen. He
[2:25:53] only sees the one he's in. And who are
[2:25:54] we in? Amen. Whether you want to talk
[2:25:56] the flesh form, the theophenic form, the
[2:25:59] supernatural, however you want to talk
[2:26:01] it. When we're in him, that's all God
[2:26:02] sees. Amen. It don't matter. We don't
[2:26:05] have to talk about what age was the most
[2:26:07] powerful age. What age had the most this
[2:26:09] age that my brother and sister, forget
[2:26:11] it. When we're in Christ, amen. When
[2:26:13] we're in him, that's all God sees. Oh,
[2:26:17] hallelujah. Let me hurry up. Just go.
[2:26:20] Amen.
[2:26:22] Remember we were talking about how that
[2:26:24] he was there in this
[2:26:27] position. He come into the flesh. He
[2:26:30] come in theophony form, spirit form
[2:26:32] really took on a body. He come in the
[2:26:36] flesh. He went out of the flesh back
[2:26:40] into the spirit form.
[2:26:43] But do you realize he comes back on the
[2:26:46] earth not in the future? He comes back
[2:26:48] on the earth once again in the flesh
[2:26:50] form. Amen.
[2:26:54] Christ in you the hope of glory. Amen.
[2:27:00] He come right back and said, "I'm going
[2:27:01] to dwell in fleshmen again." That's
[2:27:04] right. In this day. Amen. I will veil
[2:27:09] myself and those who have revelation
[2:27:12] will see me and those who don't can
[2:27:16] never see me. Amen. That's it. Now, I'm
[2:27:20] taking that, if you don't mind, I've got
[2:27:22] quotes to back it up, but I'm
[2:27:23] amalgamating that together. Amen.
[2:27:26] Because you see, those who have
[2:27:28] revelation, Brother Bram says that in
[2:27:30] this place right here, those who have
[2:27:32] revelation will see him. That's right.
[2:27:35] Those without revelation will never see
[2:27:38] him. They can't see him. That's right.
[2:27:42] But where are we looking for him? That's
[2:27:44] it. Are we looking on Mount Calvary
[2:27:46] again? Are we looking for him to be
[2:27:48] glorified in some place amongst the
[2:27:51] elders and the theologians? Or are we
[2:27:53] here in this day? Amen. Amen. Looking at
[2:27:57] Jesus Christ, looking at Christ in
[2:28:00] flesh. Amen. Once again,
[2:28:04] that's what the word says. Amen. Amen.
[2:28:06] I'm so glad that we have eyes and ears
[2:28:09] to see the word. Hallelujah. Sister,
[2:28:12] will you come to the piano? Amen. The
[2:28:16] first seal. Oh, thank you, sister
[2:28:18] Vikica. Is only to be revealed that last
[2:28:21] day when the actual seal is broken.
[2:28:24] Broken to whom? Now, this is hidden in
[2:28:27] the first seal. And we have some
[2:28:28] legalists amongst the message that have
[2:28:31] the seals all divided off that this can
[2:28:34] only be applicable to this point. If
[2:28:37] it's if it's uh in the first seal,
[2:28:39] that's way back here. Second seal, way
[2:28:42] back here. Third seal there. Seventh
[2:28:44] seal. That's way off there. I'm sorry,
[2:28:49] my brother and sister. The prophet of
[2:28:50] God showed us in the word that God in
[2:28:53] the last days, not just going by first
[2:28:56] seal, second seal, third seal, fourth
[2:28:58] seal, fifth, sixth, seventh, but it said
[2:29:01] all the mystery, not mysteries plural,
[2:29:04] because Christ is not a multiple of
[2:29:07] mysteries. He is one mystery. And if you
[2:29:09] miss one part of that mystery, you've
[2:29:11] missed Christ. That's right. So God
[2:29:13] said, "Amongst my people, I will in the
[2:29:16] last days reveal all of myself." Yes,
[2:29:20] sir.
[2:29:22] Yes, sir.
[2:29:26] When this actual seal is broken, broken
[2:29:28] to
[2:29:29] who? Not to Christ. That's right. But to
[2:29:33] the church. Oh. Oh. What brother
[2:29:36] Brandham really
[2:29:37] meant, I'm sorry, was to the prophet.
[2:29:41] No.
[2:29:45] Can I sell you on that idea? Not even if
[2:29:48] I sell it to you cheap.
[2:29:50] It's cuz it's not the truth.
[2:29:53] The people who are trying to do that
[2:29:54] have a denominational spirit. They're
[2:29:57] trying to put it all over here. That's
[2:29:59] right. That you won't understand. You
[2:30:03] don't have enough revelation to
[2:30:04] understand it. That's not what the word
[2:30:06] says. In fact, that's not what our
[2:30:08] prophet said. Amen. He said it was to
[2:30:10] the church. Cuz the church is you and I.
[2:30:13] Amen. So there it is. This seal is
[2:30:17] broken. Not to Christ, but to the
[2:30:20] church. See, notice now. Oh my. It just
[2:30:22] makes me tremble. I hope that the church
[2:30:24] truly understands it. What I mean, you
[2:30:27] people, I'm going to call you bride. See
[2:30:32] that you'll understand it. Amen. Amen.
[2:30:34] Amen. That's right. No longer veiling.
[2:30:38] Amen. The bride of Christ. Our Lord
[2:30:41] Jesus Christ. God come down in various
[2:30:43] forms, manifesting himself through the
[2:30:45] ages. And he also in all of those ages
[2:30:48] manifested a bride. That's right. In
[2:30:50] various stages and ways. But now it's
[2:30:54] coming down. The word says that he could
[2:30:57] present to himself. That's it. A bride.
[2:31:01] That's it. After his own heart. That's
[2:31:03] right. Aren't you glad? Amen. He's come.
[2:31:06] Amen. And he showed us today. It's not
[2:31:08] just almighty God, this supernatural God
[2:31:11] of the heavens, but he come all the way
[2:31:13] down and says, "Can I be your
[2:31:15] bridegroom?" Yeah. Would you say yes to
[2:31:19] being my bride? Amen. And there's a
[2:31:22] people, Praise God. Amen. There's a
[2:31:25] people, they're like, I've always wanted
[2:31:28] to be your bride. Amen. I want to be
[2:31:30] your bride. I will be your bride. Amen.
[2:31:34] Amen. Hallelujah. A a a a young couple
[2:31:37] young couple in South Africa. I'm
[2:31:39] closing. Have I said that already? All
[2:31:42] right. I don't I don't think I did, but
[2:31:44] in case I did, forgive
[2:31:46] me. A young couple in South Africa, I
[2:31:50] won't go into the whole story. Maybe at
[2:31:52] some point
[2:31:53] time. The basic gist of it, these two
[2:31:57] have liked each other forever. growing
[2:31:59] up in the church, went to the same
[2:32:00] school, liked each other forever. He
[2:32:04] backslides, goes into the
[2:32:06] world, and he's out there, and strangely
[2:32:10] enough to a young man raised in the
[2:32:11] message, the world wasn't what he
[2:32:13] thought it was. Ain't that something how
[2:32:16] Satan can present such a picture? Oh,
[2:32:19] it's just going to be a grand old time.
[2:32:24] And he said God started dealing with
[2:32:26] him. When he come back to church,
[2:32:29] repented, got his life right with the
[2:32:32] Lord. He basically looks up and sees
[2:32:34] this young lady and the feelings he'd
[2:32:37] always felt for her rise up. Only now
[2:32:40] it's a little more
[2:32:43] mature. And they started talking. They
[2:32:45] started
[2:32:47] interacting. They started doing. And he
[2:32:49] thought, "I've got to stop this right
[2:32:51] now.
[2:32:53] I don't want something that would be in
[2:32:55] my life to just appear out of the dark
[2:32:58] someday and cause her
[2:33:01] pain. And he sat down with her and he
[2:33:05] told her, "I've done this. I've done
[2:33:08] this. I've done this. I've done this.
[2:33:10] I've done
[2:33:13] this. Forgive me.
[2:33:21] [Music]
[2:33:23] makes me think of my Lord Jesus. Amen.
[2:33:27] She looked at him and
[2:33:29] says, "I don't care what you've
[2:33:32] done. I love you anyhow." Amen. Amen.
[2:33:37] Profound words. He's just sharing it
[2:33:38] with me. Bursts into tears. He said, "My
[2:33:41] heart, how could she love me so much?"
[2:33:45] That's right.
[2:33:47] And it just makes me think about this
[2:33:49] bride. Amen. The Lord's asked us to
[2:33:52] separate oursel.
[2:33:54] It can be painful sometimes.
[2:33:57] He's asked us to live a certain life a
[2:34:00] certain way. And it can be difficult at
[2:34:03] times.
[2:34:05] But I can't
[2:34:06] imagine life any other way. That's
[2:34:09] right. I can't imagine. She told them,
[2:34:11] she says, "I cannot imagine my life
[2:34:15] without you." And I'm here to say this
[2:34:18] morning, I can't imagine my life,
[2:34:22] without my Lord Jesus Christ. Can't even
[2:34:25] Can't even imagine. People are like,
[2:34:28] "Well, what about this and what about
[2:34:29] that?" No, I'm sorry. Amen. I'm sorry. I
[2:34:33] fell in love. Amen. And I'm not looking
[2:34:36] at anything but the one I love. Amen.
[2:34:39] Amen. Is it good to be sons and
[2:34:40] daughters of God?
[2:34:43] Amen.
[2:34:45] Hallelujah.
[2:34:47] My my oh
[2:34:52] [Music]
[2:34:54] my. Well, I'm not going to apologize for
[2:34:58] the amount of time. That's right. But
[2:35:00] uh I lost track of
[2:35:03] time. Amen. Let's just stand.
[2:35:07] Let's sing Amazing Grace 648. Sister
[2:35:11] Vika.
[2:35:14] Amen. I think we just need to realize
[2:35:18] just how amazing that's it. This grace,
[2:35:21] Amen. truly
[2:35:25] is. Hallelujah.
[2:35:31] Amazing
[2:35:33] grace. Oh, how
[2:35:35] sweet the
[2:35:38] sound that
[2:35:41] saved a
[2:35:43] wretch like
[2:35:47] [Music]
[2:35:49] me. For I
[2:35:51] once was
[2:35:54] lost. Oh, but
[2:35:57] now I'm found.
[2:36:00] I was
[2:36:02] blind, but
[2:36:04] now I
[2:36:06] [Music]
[2:36:09] see. Was
[2:36:12] grace that
[2:36:14] taught my
[2:36:17] heart to
[2:36:19] fear and
[2:36:21] grace my
[2:36:24] fears
[2:36:29] really. How
[2:36:32] precious
[2:36:34] dear that
[2:36:37] grace
[2:36:39] appear the
[2:36:41] hour I
[2:36:44] first
[2:36:48] believe through
[2:36:52] many
[2:36:54] dangerous
[2:36:56] toils and snares
[2:36:59] I
[2:37:01] have
[2:37:04] already
[2:37:08] come. It is
[2:37:11] grace hath brought. Oh,
[2:37:15] hallelujah. Safe thus
[2:37:18] far. Oh, and
[2:37:20] grace will
[2:37:23] lead me home.
[2:37:29] The Lord. Oh yes. Our Lord
[2:37:33] promise
[2:37:35] good to
[2:37:38] me. His
[2:37:40] word, my
[2:37:43] hope
[2:37:47] secures. He
[2:37:50] will my
[2:37:52] shield and
[2:37:55] portion be.
[2:37:58] as
[2:37:59] long as
[2:38:02] life
[2:38:03] [Music]
[2:38:06] endures. Yay.
[2:38:09] When this
[2:38:11] flesh and
[2:38:14] heart shall
[2:38:16] fail and
[2:38:19] mortal
[2:38:21] life shall cease.
[2:38:27] I shall. Oh, thank you,
[2:38:31] Lord.
[2:38:33] Within the
[2:38:36] veil, a
[2:38:38] life of
[2:38:41] joy and
[2:38:45] peace. The
[2:38:47] world shall
[2:38:50] soon to
[2:38:53] ruin go.
[2:38:56] The
[2:38:57] sun will
[2:38:59] refuse to
[2:39:03] shine. Hallelujah. Isn't this beautiful?
[2:39:07] God who
[2:39:09] called me
[2:39:12] here
[2:39:14] below. All shall
[2:39:16] be
[2:39:19] forever mine.
[2:39:24] When
[2:39:26] we've been
[2:39:28] there
[2:39:32] 10,000
[2:39:33] years, bright
[2:39:37] shineing
[2:39:38] as the
[2:39:43] sun with
[2:39:45] no less days to
[2:39:50] sing God's praise
[2:39:54] And
[2:39:55] when we
[2:39:58] first

[2:40:47] love the Lord? Amen. Hallelujah. Is he
[2:40:49] not good to us? Amen. All through the
[2:40:53] ages appearing and come and in this day
[2:40:58] literally come down and made himself
[2:41:02] known. Amen. Like never before. People
[2:41:06] say, "Brother Paul, do you think we have
[2:41:10] more than they had?" The prophet says
[2:41:14] so.
[2:41:15] He says we have the greatest
[2:41:18] understanding
[2:41:19] revelation through the ages is here now.
[2:41:23] Why? Because it's the fullness of the
[2:41:26] mystery. That's right. Of Christ. Amen.
[2:41:29] Amen. Let's just sing another song. I

[2:41:37] each and everyone. Amen. I say this I
[2:41:40] hope you see the humor of it. I I'm just
[2:41:43] don't know why I feel inspired. If we're
[2:41:45] not going to praise, Philip's going to
[2:41:46] make it up for us. Okay? Amen. He's
[2:41:49] going to let us know. Hear me. Amen.
[2:41:51] Hear ye. The Lord our God is one God.
[2:41:54] Hallelujah. Amen. Hallelujah.
[2:42:00] When I saw the cleansing
[2:42:07] fountain,
[2:42:09] open wide for all my
[2:42:15] sins.
[2:42:17] I oy the spirit's wooing.
[2:42:24] Oh, when he said, "Wilt thou be
[2:42:32] clean?"
[2:42:34] I will praise
[2:42:37] him.
[2:42:39] I will praise
[2:42:43] him.
[2:42:45] Praise the lamb for sinners slain.

[2:42:55] Give him gloryy all ye
[2:43:02] people for his blood has washed
[2:43:13] away.
[2:43:15] Though the way seems straight and
[2:43:22] narrow, and
[2:43:24] all I claimed was swept
[2:43:32] away.
[2:43:33] My
[2:43:35] ambition, plans, and wishes.
[2:43:41] Oh, at my feet in ashes
[2:43:49] lay. Oh,
[2:43:51] I will praise
[2:43:55] him.
[2:43:57] I will praise
[2:44:00] him.

[2:44:18] people for his blood has washed
[2:44:24] away each
[2:44:28] stain. Oh, praise the Lord.
[2:44:31] Then God's fire upon the
[2:44:39] altar
[2:44:40] of my heart was set a
[2:44:48] flame.
[2:44:49] I shall never cease to praise
[2:44:56] him. Oh, gloryy, gloryy
[2:45:00] to his
[2:45:04] name. Oh, let's just give him
[2:45:07] praise. We'll praise
[2:45:11] him.
[2:45:13] I will praise him. Lord, we thank you.
[2:45:19] The lamb for sinners slain.

[2:46:00] in.
[2:46:03] Hallelujah.
[2:46:05] He's forgive my
[2:46:11] transgression. Oh, he has cleansed my
[2:46:15] heart from sin.

[2:46:26] him.
[2:46:28] I will praise

[2:46:41] slain.
[2:46:43] Give him glory all ye people.
[2:46:51] for his blood has washed
[2:46:59] away. Amen. As we just go before the
[2:47:02] Lord. Heavenly
[2:47:04] Father, Lord, with all of my
[2:47:08] heart, Lord, I thank you, Father, in
[2:47:12] every way that you have come and showed
[2:47:15] yourself to
[2:47:16] us as our peace, as our comfort, as a
[2:47:20] redeemer, as a healer, as a
[2:47:23] provider. Every way that you've come has
[2:47:26] been so real to us, Lord, Father. and we
[2:47:29] stand here today and say thank
[2:47:32] you father for the grace and the mercy
[2:47:35] that you have poured out upon us. You
[2:47:38] Lord are so
[2:47:41] wonderful. You're so good to us Lord.
[2:47:44] And I thank you father that when we look
[2:47:46] through the word clearly you show us
[2:47:51] that even in the worst of
[2:47:53] days you never leave us nor forsake us.
[2:47:56] Amen. Even in our darkest trials, you're
[2:48:00] hearing our voice, responding to our
[2:48:03] call. Amen. Listening to our confession.
[2:48:06] That's right. And never never once
[2:48:10] forsaking us. I pray father Lord just
[2:48:13] give us strength as we see you in a
[2:48:16] clear vision Lord as the word coming
[2:48:19] forth to see Father Lord as I tried this
[2:48:23] morning to just lay out this pattern
[2:48:25] where you have come in a theophony and
[2:48:28] then come in the flesh and father you've
[2:48:31] come back again in the theophony and now
[2:48:35] Lord you've come back again in the
[2:48:39] flesh oh Lord that you would count us
[2:48:42] worthy to be your temple. You'd count us
[2:48:46] worthy to be your
[2:48:48] house. Lord, you'd count us worthy to
[2:48:51] give praise, glory, and honor to
[2:48:55] you. Lord, help us to look beyond this
[2:48:59] flesh. This flesh is not our
[2:49:02] friend. This flesh is our adversary.
[2:49:05] And you have said that you have
[2:49:07] conquered vanquished every
[2:49:10] enemy. Therefore, Father, I can declare
[2:49:13] today
[2:49:14] wholeheartedly with confidence we have
[2:49:17] conquered this flesh. Oh Lord, lead us
[2:49:21] and guide us. I thank you, Father, for
[2:49:23] the patience of the
[2:49:24] saints. Pour back into them, Father,
[2:49:27] their strength. Lord, reward them for
[2:49:30] their
[2:49:31] diligence. Lord, we love you and we so
[2:49:33] thank you, Father. lead us and guide us
[2:49:36] this day for the rest of this week and
[2:49:39] the days and weeks to come in the name
[2:49:41] of Jesus
[2:49:42] Christ. God bless you saints. It's good
[2:49:45] to be here today to be with you. I pray
[2:49:48] the presence of the Lord goes with you,
[2:49:50] strengthens
[2:49:51] you. Brothers, if I could meet with you
[2:49:54] after God bless you. You're dismissed.
