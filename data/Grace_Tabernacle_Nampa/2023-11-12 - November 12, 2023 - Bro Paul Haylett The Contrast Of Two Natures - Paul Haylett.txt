the song says there I want to be one of the first are Amen to testify amen amen sir I don't want to let all the other options all the other voices be finished and then say well maybe I do have something to say you know we kind of view it in humanity a little presumptuous when somebody says you have a testimony and somebody jumps up I do but you know I was just reading and the prophet of God says you know we ought to be quick to give praise and honor to the Lord amen Lord help us to be quick amen is it good to be in the house of the Lord today Hallelujah you know it's uh it's just a good good time to be a Christian amen we're living in a world that's falling apart economies falling apart countries are falling apart and the bride is coming together amen that's the word of God the the very adhesive of this gospel is drawing a people together not around personality not about power not about the beauty of a church but about the word of God and I say thank you amen and um you know I just uh a a little prayer request that I would just like to bring up to you um I just made a deal with a little sister the other day uh and I won't go into it here here uh but uh I made a deal with a little sister the other day and kind of caught her off guard and I just said um it was a visitor uh and I just said um you know can I make a deal with you and she looked at me a little bit you know not suspicious I would say but like okay what and I said I'll pray for you you pray for me and she eagerly grasp that and you know I I got to thinking about that Saints and I I've been uh doing my best to to remember to pray for her not just once a day but to lift this little girl now if we look at the outside sometimes we look at the outside we look at the outside that's right absolutely right and we judge by the outside but down inside can be a heart that is so hungry for the things of God and in that some sometimes all they need is just a little help amen starting out in the walk am a little help to take those first difficult steps because if we could see into the spiritual world we would see every step that a son or daughter of God makes towards the Lord the devil's over there saying oh no no no remember we're your friends right we need to lift one another up in prayer amen our young people our families our elderly how easy it is I try my best and I I don't say this any kind of judgmental Factor don't misunderstand me I try my best to keep brother Bob and sister Joanne's name on our prayer list before the church because you see if we're not careful they're not here what's the old phrase we're not examp right let's continue to lift one another up in fervent prayer amen amen amen I pray let that be our commitment to one another amen amen I pray for you you pray for me amen and then as we have a whole body praying for one another if we was to draw the graph I've seen it done this way you draw the graph and every connecting line leaves almost a perfect perfectly solid painted picture because there's the prayers going every which direction and I say God help us to have that commitment to each other let's stand this morning I I I can tell already I'm going to be in trouble because um I I have left a lot of holes in this you'll find there there's you your mind will take you to a lot of scriptures and say brother Paul didn't touch on that I did but they're on the desk I cut them off and it's still a lot of food amen anybody come hungry this morning hallelujah hallelujah let's turn in our Bibles to Matthew 24: 3-13 and as we would just look at this we're going to draw uh just one verse really is my main focus but um you know it's good to just have a good foundation right um it's uh good that we we don't just isolate things but we keep things continuity amen Matthew 24 and3 and as he sat upon Mount of Olives the disciples came unto him privately now there's already been a public expression you know the public has all kinds of questions my brother and sister but let me just speak kind of boldly today if yall don't mind we serve a God who gives answers amen he doesn't leave us with questions he answers the questions now it might be in his time his season and we'd say Lord why didn't you come sooner but his plan is perfect but I'm telling you my brother and sister when you do and I I won't go into this because I've just been wandering all kinds of rabbit Trails this last week but I'm telling you my brother and sister you go into the world of major denominational Theology and they have answers that you look back at scripture and say how can they come up with that conclusion but by God's grace Can someone say by God's grace amen we have a word that has aligned us and we look and it's not just oh this is our Theology and we're going but it's there that the word has its own Rabbit Trail and if you'll understand what I'm saying is you'll start down this path and it will connect you here and it will connect you here and it will connect you here and here and here and here and here and here until you find out what you believe is the Bible That's Right amen you say well of course it is brother Paul no there's a difference you see what some people believe is in the Bible what you believe is the Bible there's a lot of difference lot of difference absolutely Trinity has scriptural footing without Revelation that's right amen anybody know where I was okay he said upon Mount olives the disciples came unto him privately saying tell us when shall these things be and what shall be the sign of thy coming and of the end of the world Jesus answered and said unto them take heed that no man deceive you that's a good start isn't it for many shall come in my name saying I am Christ and shall deceive many now the prophet of God said if they actually come and said they were the Christ no one would believe them but they are Christ meaning anointed one so they've come saying they're anointed and ye shall hear of wars and rumors of wars and hamash shalt attack Israel see that you be not troubled for all these things must come to pass but the end is not yet for nation shall rise against nation and Kingdom against Kingdom and there shall be famines and pestilence and earthquakes and diverse places and all these are the beginning of Sorrows then shall they deliver you up to be afflicted and shall kill you and you shall be hated of All Nation for my name's sake and then shall any be offended boy that sure come to pass and shall betray one another and shall hate one another and still believe the message and many false prophets shall rise and shall deceive many and because of iniquity I put the of in there because iniquity shall abound the love of many shall wax cold but he that shall endure until the end the same shall be saved can we say Amen thank you Lord Jesus father for the enduring power of your word Lord the protective power of the blood Lord that holds us day by day in the E and flow of everything of Life Lord you're here you are our Strong Tower our sword our Shield you are all in all you're the King of Kings the Lord of lords father we fail to even identify you Lord correctly and in fullness father help us Lord Jesus to see you give his eyes to see Lord I pray in the name of Jesus Christ Christ amen and amen you may be seated now Webster says that iniquity is the quality of being unfair or evil something that is unfair or evil a gross Injustice a wickedness a wicked act or thing sin now as we look at this my brother and sister the prophet of God actually brings out to us a slightly different uh definition and and as we look at that I just want to uh put a little more scripture and thought into here uh to understand or lay it out that you see some people well mostly critics amen I don't think a real believer is going to have a problem with this but they say you know that's misquoted that's not really got the right foundation how he's presenting that but I'm telling you my brother and sister this might to them sound crazy but I'm sold out far enough to look Beyond Webster to the word and God sent the word in our hour to be clarified and Webster's good they've collected everybody's opinion on what what means what but I tell you what when you have a Divine interpretation of the word of God then we can rest upon that and so you know we look at this and James 4:17 says therefore to him that knoweth to do good and doeth it not to him it is sin very straightforward we don't have to try to interpret that amen but you know the prophet of God put it to us as uh and these are my words as to knowing to do right and not doing it so my brother and sister one might be in sin and not know that he's in sin and therefore it would be hard in sense to say that you have iniquity because there's no knowledge of the right and the wrong you know as it was in the mission field many years ago there were people that was the missionaries went to I remember reading in Papa New Guinea these people had no no clue of words like up and down and right and left and right and wrong they had no clue of that but they had a very strong moral fiber in their tribes and there were certain things you just didn't do no one had to explain why you don't do that you just don't do it and so we recognize my brother and sister that the uh Sadducees and Pharisees uh had the word but they tossed the word for their tradition they tossed the word for their ideology and added as it were history shows us that when a circumstance would arise they would simply add another chapter to their books of how to deal with that and that then become the law and they claimed that that was attached directly back to Moses they claimed that this really was just an extension of Moses's words but my brother and sister man had his hand in there so strongly that after a season after Generations people didn't know because let's face it Saints I hope this doesn't apply to us there's such a strong Spirit on the land I don't know whether take this as an example or not people know all the teams that play hockey or football or basketball they know the names of the greats they don't know who brought the word yeah it's a matter of priorities it's a matter of what the focus is and you know we won't go into this because it gets quite lengthy and drawn out but my brother and sister words believe it or not affect everything amen who we actually speak of oursel how we actually speak of ourself is is a major foreteller of how we actually view ourselves in the eyes of God and so it's there that we recognize is that a man that knoweth to do good and doesn't do it to him it is sin and brother brandham brings it down to us that if you you know to do something and you are not doing it it is Iniquity to you and the word is very clear that iniquity is sin and so it's there that as we won't get to all of it today we see how that as they're speaking to Jesus and he speaks to them very strongly and he tells them depart from me you workers of iniquity now these were people that come and said you know what we've done many mighty works in your name but they missed a key element and we could preach on that today and and draw a lengthy deal but it wasn't really what was on my heart amen but I want to just also to 1 Corinthians 10 and 21 it shows us that we cannot be caught between two opinions we cannot be caught between our ideas and and someone else's ideas or or what they think of us my brother and sister it's a it's an interesting thing we live in the world uh you hear testimonies of such of of neighbors very critical to Believers uh their children making fun of of uh believer's children about uh old doy oldfashioned you know you look like you come out of another Century but when their child is sick and laying on a deathbed whose door do they knock on acknowledging we haven't even called our pastor we have not even called our church because we see God in you amen my brother and sister this is the god that we serve now First Corinthians 10:21 says you cannot drink of the cup of the Lord and the cup of devils you cannot be partakers of the Lord's table and of the table of devils so a very clear line dividing amen don't you like things clear-cut I like things when they are just you know uh just dividing you know down in the in the in the supply room we have that paper cutter and I was just one day doing some stuff and the blade was raised up and I brush my Knuckles over it and then I look down it's like where did the blood on that page come from I never even felt it my brother and sister I want the word to be that sharp in my life I want the word to come and just rightly divide my life I don't want to be one who is sitting here with iniquity thinking I'm making it amen but look look how it is God Has Come aren't you glad we can today make the profession or the claim that we have a restored word amen amen we're not looking now backwards it's good there's nothing wrong with looking back but my brother and sister the fullness of the manifestation of the mystery of Jesus Christ was not fulfilled a thousand years ago it was fulfilled and revealed today and so we are standing in the greatest of times in and the most beautiful of times to be standing not looking back I remember one time a brother he's kind of a western guy he said oh if I could just go into the old west and I just couldn't help myself brother I said you don't want to do that with that nice wavy hair of yours hanging on the pole in a teepee somewhere and he was like brother Paul that was kind not kind but you see we're not called to go back there we can't live out a fantasy of I wanted to be a cowboy or I wanted to be this or I wanted to be that God called us to this this hour and he's brought a restored word everything put back in place to take us to our real home amen now we can I I'll tell you what you know they're building them out in our country out there uh uh you know nice homes nice homes beautiful homes brother Ivan and sister nauy are building a beautiful home but you see there's a difference they are looking at that as their future but this house we are building is our future amen praise God those of you blessed to be able to do that amen it's wonderful but praise God that this world is not our home amen that whatever we have here we say thank you Lord for and we're willing to walk away from it in a heartbeat hallelujah amen cuz this word come to turn our hearts back and I guess I'm just feeling this way this morning morning if you don't mind is a heart's turn back Hallelujah not turn back to Egypt amen I'll tell you I just can't even imagine now I know scripturally if you don't mind a little humor I I'm kind of a finicky eater I can't imagine anybody that would like garlic and leaks I'm serious I mean what what are they thinking sister Jerry fried some brussels sprouts put them on my plate it's like this goes with your lunch you know she's got me so buffaloed saints that I actually ate a few of them and then I finally was like that tastes like dirt and I'm not in the mood to eat dirt but my brother and sister people constantly drawn back oh that tasted so good I remember when I was drunk in the alley I remember when I was this and smelled like well I won't go into all those descriptions and they they they almost talk with a fness but this world's not our home I'm so glad a restored word come and and it might be painful but God's pulling you root by root out of Le oysa he's pulling them up Saints and I think I know you well enough that I can say amen for you it's not always comfortable when God takes a hold of something and pulls a root out of Le oysa he pulls us loose but yet there's a liberty to come amen there's something there that's so incredible our hearts are being turned back yes sir we're feeling a pull we're we're hearing a call you know I hear my fony that's right oh it's calling me somewhere beyond the veil not just wooing us to church that's right God doesn't have attendance record of wooing you to church he has an attendance record of wooing you home back into his presence amen hallelujah I say it's momentum momentous it's incredible blessing to be chosen and I mean I don't even know how to put it in words but I just remember as a little boy I was pretty good at baseball uh played some of it and did different things up into high school a little bit and and you know uh you're out there and just a a a game you know not official game just a game and you're standing there with all these kids and their twos and teams it's a heartbreak to be the one still standing there when they go to play and sometimes they just chose because of favoritism of friendships and whatever because maybe you're there why did they choose that boy and you watch the game and he strikes out every time he gets to the plate and the ball comes to him and he's like and the ball and you're like why didn't they choose me I want you to pull that into a spiritual Realm we are sitting here not of our abilities not how good we are at anything in this life but God says you know what you might not be the best outward Christian in the church but I chose you and because I chose you you will live and fulfill and manifest and overcome and you will lift a voice and praise me you'll call to the heavens my name and glorify it and we're over here saying but I am a poor Christian it doesn't matter you were chosen that's right it didn't matter how good the man on the bench was if he wasn't chosen he's not playing and God has come and chose you and I has made it possible I say it's an incredible blessing to be chosen to be found in his righteousness amen but look at this unless we would boast of ourselves right the Apostle Paul lays that out very clearly L we would boast of ourselves God let your flesh get in your way so you can't boast amen cuz I'll just tell you what just as humble as I am my daddy raised me when people say oh I'm so humble my daddy's like don't believe them humble people don't have to tell you they're humble humble people are just humble so in my humble of opinion yes could I bid half a cent for my opinion can we get a half a cent four10 310 two10 okay I'll just give it to you for free amen look at this my brother and sister it's not our righteousness right so when the scripture deals with this cup of righteousness deals with this righteousness we realize what's being filled into that cup is not us amen no place for us to stand and say you know I've been such a good Christian for x amount of years that's right but there's a washing taking place Hallelujah Can someone say Amen there's a washing We Believe most of us here I believe in the building have believed the message for years and we got young people coming up and they're and then they're they're grasping that with their hearts and my brother and sister that's so wonderful but you see my brother and sister it's all about the washing amen you know I I I just you know well my mind goes to a lot of examples I've known some very interesting people in my life and one was a Rancher out here in the awai he's uh he was worth literally tens of millions of dollars and he would wear his his pants he wore Levis and he would wear them until they were so crusty that they literally could stand up in the corner by themselves and when he passed away and his family come one of his daughters which we know come and they were taking care of things in his house they found something on the order of 4550 brand new pair of Levis in the house because through the years the daughters and grandchildren and Friends it be like he must surely not be able to afford a a pair of pants to wear those but what he would do he would wear those until they could almost walk by themselves and at the day he declared them he didn't go wash them he threw them away and started wearing another pair there might be some issues there one time one of his grandchildren said Grandpa do you ever take a bath and he said what are you talking about boy I took one this year year but here's the bride of Christ every day Wash Me Lord amen Wash Me Lord amen cleanse me Lord that I might be wider than snow cleanse me Lord my heart is crying out cleanse me do we approach God because we're afraid of missing the Rapture no sir because we know we were called to be like him and we desire to be like him because we are part of him and so there's something in us that recognizes here's our cleansing here is the washing here's what I long for this is what I need amen and I tell you what we got to do Saints and we got to just stand still I just reading in the message the other day and brother Bram says you know God can't use flighty people Lord anchor my feet in the word don't let me be flighty if the preaching of the word hurts anchor me and let me take it Lord don't let me be flighty you see some religions they have prescribed methods there's part of the reasons the methodists have the name Methodist is because they had a method for everything my I come across a very interesting quotation amen oh let me say we have a prescribed method so they're not out of line in their thoughts we have a prescribed method so does that leave us equal to the methodists no yes not a method of man's thinking but a method of the word amen there's where the difference comes so religion give prescribed methods right now we know religion says you know what what you do you sin and you need to come and uh we're not going to serve you Holy Communion unless you've come to conf confession and so they set a time for confession and and those of you that have come out of that how that is and uh I had a friend um he was a man I worked on a ranch with many years ago and and he was like I got I got to leave early tonight can you finish my my work with these cattle Paul because I I got to go to confession tonight and I said well it's Friday and he goes I know if I go to Friday night confession I can sin all weekend and I've got till next Friday to make it right now did he come up with that on his own no it was something a foundation that was laid and so it was there that we see my brother and sister how that they are then brought because there is a contrast between these Natures there's a strong contrast between these natures and so it's h you know I have a prescribed time the priest knows I'm faithful about being there I'll be there and he knows I'm coming amen so you come to confession at this time and he was also taught that salvation was in the church so if he made the church happy he was saved I just want to tell you I I enjoyed brother David's sermon Wednesday night how high are we going to set the standard saints come on if the church is going to be the answer I'm going to tell you I've got the standard way up here I haven't reached it myself yet but I'm working towards reaching it would that give us any encouragement to know that the man preaching to you every service doesn't see you as an overcomer he sees you as a a Trier or a failure no my brother and sister so God's got this he he he's giving us this uh there and and if you teach that salvation's in the church or maybe it's a church movement that's how we describe it around the message if if you're believing like we believe everything will be okay even if you're sinning you're going to be okay cuz you believe like we believe my brother and sister that's nonsense that's a denominational divisive Spirit that's just trying to separate you from the word amen because if he can get you out of the word then he's got you amen now I want you I know you guys will probably think man what is Paul studying where's his brain been I want to read you a quotation from Joseph Smith y'all know who he is don't you no he is not the guy that lives down here on Smith Avenue quotation from Joseph Smith repentance is a thing that cannot be trifled with every day daily transgressions and daily repentance is not that which is pleasing in the sight of God did you comprehend maybe I should have had the brothers put it on the screen let me read it again repentance is not a thing that cannot be trifled with every day in other words we can't mess with this every day repentance is not something you can deal with every day daily transgressions do we have any of those my Prophet said I backslide daily I said amen when I heard it amen and daily repentance is not that which is pleasing in the sight of God so your daily transgression and your repentance of it does not please God so if I read that in correct context I flunked English almost every year I took it so but in the right context so you can transgress he's saying that your repentance Daily doesn't please God is that not interesting because the prophet of God told us we backslide daily and then he taught us soon as the Holy Spirit brings that to your attention lays that on your spirit brings it to your mind you repent and make it right now look where religion's going in this world my brother and sister what they're doing is allowing a people to be justified of their cup filling up are you with me their cup is filling up and they're being encouraged let the cup be filled up that's not the Holy Spirit that's another spirit and so you see this now and what is this I I I really struggled in in kind of putting this together in in the sense of there's such a vast information but let me put it this way my brother and sister I I almost titled this the tale of two cups and you see right here that this world that we're living in this cup of iniquity the scripture says when it gets completely full then God is coming to judge the world and so it's there that we recognize if Satan is filling a cup then God's got a cup also that he is filling amen and so it hear when the cup of iniquity in other words a vast multitude of record Ed events in our lives that did not please God not according to Joseph Smith's pleasing but truly pleasing God and so it's there that you would look at that but I'm telling you oh Hallelujah I get excited this is farther down but I can say it two or three times it'll still be as good amen we'll still say Amen to it even if we hear it a few times my brother and sister my cup of iniquity was filling up and then God got a hold of me and started speaking to me started speaking to you and he started pouring in righteousness and when righteousness went in my brother and sister iniquity couldn't stay in the cup and iniquity started leaving the cup and righteousness started filling the cup but the only thing that will push iniquity out of our cup is righteousness is the Holy Ghost is relationship with Jesus Christ and so if the culture that's anointed my brother and sister they are there oh it's all right it's all right God under understands he does he understands you don't care about your cup he understands that you are have a you're a religionist hopefully I'm not preaching too straightened but look at this my brother and sister so an encouragement Saints just do whatever you want in business in relationships every just do what you want God understands David said my cup runneth over he was not talking about a cup of iniquity he was talking oh oh he'd had iniquity I was just reading a little history about be Sheba amen now I don't know why I was reading history about BBA but I was reading history about BBA and you know I didn't realize it was such a controversial we're not worried about getting you in the Rapture we're worried about what Beba did was intentional or not and we're worried about did David dismiss all of his servants so no one could see him sin and we're worried about where was Bas made was she complient to this would she be judged also and we're digging through things it's called religion it's not the word oh it's the word but it's not the word it's not the word that saves souls and delivers mankind it's theology it's man's idea of what's important oh I I think knowledge is good be honest with you knowledge versus ignorance is good I want to know the Lord I want to understand him I want to see him I want to know his voice voice you know one of the things that we miss is God's present we believe he's here today some people walk out of church maybe today and say I don't know what he was even talking about my brother and sister you got to have an ear to hear amen we can't just go and automatically walk out blessed it's not like we're giving candy at the door you know just reading about where brother Brown was talking about Christmas now Saints if we're going to do it the way brother Brown did the kids exp an orange at Christmas time yeah they think that's what church is about they think it's about all this little stuff it's about the word amen this is God's place he chose to put it it doesn't limit it to here but this was God's choosing he said not to forsake yourself and so we come and what do we do when we're in church we should be eating on the word amen and what is the word amen it is the very spiritual nutrition that gives you strength enough to Face Tomorrow gives you strength enough to face your problem face your children face your husband face your wife face your boss face everything that might give trouble to you what are you trying to say brother Paul yeah yeah know every man that ever got married has wife trouble and every wife that ever got married has husband trouble Man trouble oh come on don't look at me like that you know I'm telling the truth and those of you look the smuggest don't forget I know you no but we have a good marriage brother Paul can be better have a good relationship with the Lord it can be better have a good relationship with my brothers and sisters in the church it can be better amen let's not settle let's not decide we've reached a plateau we don't need to go no further we've got it we've got the message we've got it no my brother and sister I want to rise up into Heavenly places amen that's not some miraculous thing of God jerking you out of your attitude and your situation and putting you up here God's going to make you climb them steps God's going to make you walk up that mountain he's going to make you walk through the valley of the bitter and in the end you rise up and be able to say praise God God gave me the perfect wife give me the perfect husband oh come on Saints don't just don't fall down on me here gave me the perfect children but they're not serving God they're still God's chosen gift to you boy I could really be humble this morning and say God gave you the perfect pastor but that might be going just a little bit too far really like Joseph Smith's Outlook we don't have time to be worried about our little lives and our little arguments in our temper tantrums and our thises and thats and I mean look Saints I hope you don't mind I don't get too sidetracked here when I was a kid my sister would know all about this little town of green leaf had one of them little Old Country Stores pot belly stove in the middle old wor out drooping porch on the outside everybody in the country knew everybody in the country's business kind of like church and um as a kid we'd go in there and you know it'd be not necessarily winter time but we'd go in there and the candy iow was backways from the checkout and kids don't you take this for an example your parents don't spank you I will but we'd go back there and I just shovel some candy in that coat pocket we were so clever oh look at us nice ceiling God dealt with our heart we go back to deal with the Robertson family we stole from you yeah you never fooled us H really you never called the police no we prayed for you that's it and here you are today coming to confess your shortcoming our prayers have been answered that's right oh God help us not to judge one another his people free methodists amen that looked at it and said all these kids need all this family needs all that husband needs all those children Need Is Christ there's our answer there's what will solve this problem this is what will change it what is it my brother and sister it is the contrast of two natures and when we recognize we're not dealing with an individual brother Brown didn't say now that person is a devil he tells us he shows us that person has a spirit on them and so you can love the person without loving the spirit that we as humans often times quit loving the person right yeah now look this is contrasted as I said with the prophet telling us to repent amen every single day and look I think the prophet May base that on the Apostle Paul that said I Die daily amen Apostle Paul didn't say I wait once a month or when it's convenient he said I Die daily oh let me just be like the Apostle Paul Amen in the message look brother Brandon preaches this says this we're at the end time friends can we say Amen I'm looking for Jesus to come that blessed Lord Jesus who I loved and has give my life to as a young man I'm still looking for him to come I believe he will though like Abraham it may linger oh my I just listening to the prophet the other day and he was like we are looking the coming of the Lord is going to be any day now oh wait I can figure that out 61 that's how old I'm that's 61 years ago any day if you're hanging on with a blind hope just hang on long enough oh if I can just hang on long enough if I can hang on long enough I'll make the Rapture no you won't no you won't cuz you got all the wrong reasons that you're pursuing this all the wrong reasons give up die just die God will take care of it he's the promise we're not the promise he's the promise he chose to fulfill the promise in us so we now become the manifestation of the promise in other words I'll put it this way when he promised that he would be in you he was guaranteeing that deity would be residing in you so you are here filled with deity but I don't live like deity no God's got that covered you just keep following him you walk with him you talk with him and you keep your life clean I'll tell you nothing worse than being in a house with a bunch of Bachelors I hung out with some guys Colorado many years ago we never visited a laundry mat until we were down to our last pair of socks and now Walmart wasn't around back in them days but Kmart was and there's a whole bunch of young men that were guilty of I don't want to do laundry it's easier now I wasn't serving the lord it's easier on the way to the movie stop by Kmart buy more socks pry soon you own 40 pairs of socks my brother and sister if we apply that spiritually look at how stinky we get come on I know this is church and I know we're dignified people but do you know what a man smells like after he has worked hard yeah we won't go there that's what our Dirty Laundry smells like right not good amen though like Abraham it may linger yet I get stronger and more in love with him expressing myself that's right not just when I come to church on Sunday special meetings come on let's just settle for special meetings then then we can just pour it all out and jump and shout and scream and tear around no no no he says I express myself daily to him I know every believer in here does the same thing now I want to put emphasis on the prophet of God saying every believer here does the same thing he doesn't say every believer might hold the same opinion every believer thinks that's probably what we ought to he says they do the same thing Hallelujah you know there's so much to be spoken of about iniquity maybe we'll come back in Future services but you see my brother and sister it really comes down I like things in Simplicity I I love things in Simplicity brother Isaac was helping me on a little problem I had and and there is a wiring diagram and um me and wiring diagrams don't speak the same language brother Isaac's just like going okay this goes here and this goes over to this switch and this comes down here to this little thing and comes back around here and comes up ties into this and and at the U-turn over here I was like like just tell me where we're going that's all I need to know tell me where I'm going cuz I'll tell you what Saints I've been preaching a little bit on Wednesday nights about Vision I don't want to know where you came from I want to see where you're going and if you see where you're going you won't care where you came from but when you lose your vision you'll start saying now okay I'm not sure where I'm going maybe I need to go back to where I came from to figure out where I'm going and Satan draws you in a giant U-turn and many people have found themselves right back sitting on a bar stool and wondering how they got there amen because their Vision got clouded and they started looking back my brother and sister they didn't leave Egypt to turn around and go back they were having a jubile they were having a Revival they were shouting they were screaming but somewhere along along the way maybe a few thousands or tens of thousands of steps into the journey they remembered about that perfect mattress they had back there my feather pillow my mattress my reading light I put my eight hours in at the factory I go home I let the priest pray for deliverance come on leoda is an extension of Egypt it's the same spirit and if you're not careful you go out there and you do a U-turn and you look back and you remember our church had good meetings we were good people we didn't sin but you didn't have Revelation see Satan diminishes Revelation okay I I'm just falling off the track track here but you see in iniquity my brother and sister there's a spiritual motivated and the spiritually unmotivated now I want to ask you the last time I trust that someone here would be able to identify but the last time you walked up to somebody and said forgive me that didn't come natural you had to be determined to set the misunderstanding right determined I don't care if we're talking about husbands and wives or parents and children or you know whatever it might be the body of Believers but you see a spiritually motivated man or woman is the one when the prophet said read they read pray they pray repent they repent why because they're motivated now we all go go through moments of motivation right here a while back you know I dug out some barbells and I thought you know it's a little it's a little you know whatever but I I can go out here in the shed and I could lift a few weights and and um and I um thought about it some more and um I thought about it the next day and um then it was too close to the weekend I need to study for church so you guys were the reason I didn't go lift them then and you see if you're unmotivated it doesn't matter what excuse we use the contrast but when the Rapture is in plain view do we believe the Rapture is in plain view hallelu that's what this message is about the Rapture coming into Plain View and when the Rapture is in plain view and we're looking at this we start to recognize you know what I can do this by God's grace I can literally get out of bed in the morning and I can say Lord here am I here am I Lord but the unmotivated always says maybe tomorrow I'll start tomorrow remember you know that's the same thing why diets are what they are is because we're always starting tomorrow and that's what the spiritual world is it's always about I'm starting tomorrow what is that if you know you should start today and you don't start it's a proc procrastinating blond we have some blond hair blue eyes I shouldn't say it that way forgive me I'm going to say it anyway we have some blond-haired blue-eyed procrastinating Devils anointing us and the reason I use that is because usually people associate blonde hair and blue eyes to being attractive so we've got these attractive demons they don't come my brother and sister they don't come with big snaggly teeth and fangs and Claws they come attractive I have a reason now those of you are blonde hair and blue I know who you are so I wasn't picking on you actually I gave you a compliment didn't I I said you were attractive so anyway look at this see we're not we're not speaking to the unbeliever or the makeb believer Saints I'm speaking to the believer today because it's there we do not want iniquity to be named amongst us we don't want to become I mean the first church of the iniquity yeah over in Oregon there going to brother riches there's a church over there I won't go into it but you know they finally changed their sign last time we was over brother riches he was like praise God they changed their sign because you know you don't want you don't want your sign to give a pre uh um you know an idea of what you are and we changed our sign out here and said First Church of the iniquity you think we'd have any inv visitors well actually we might I never thought about that in the seven Church ages revelation of Jesus Christ brother Brown says you recall that I mentioned at the beginning of this message that this book we are studying is actual revelation of Jesus himself in the church and his work in the future ages then I mentioned that it takes the Holy Spirit to give us Revelation or we will fail to get it bringing those two thoughts together you will see it won't take just any ordinary study or thinking to make this book real it's going to take the operation of the Holy Ghost Can someone say thank you Lord that means that this book can't be revealed to anyone but a special class of people that is as great a compliment as God could give you the prophet could give you to declare you a special class of people not the ordinary not the just bypass of the you know the junk the rejects no uh special class of people amen hallelujah hallelujah any anyway it will take one with prophetic Insight I want to just ask you any of you got prophetic Insight on one side we'd say no but just stop and think about it that's right when the PHD g d l d double D whatever I've always thought D's were associated with dentist as a kid I'd hear brother brandham say that you know there there Double D I'm like they're Den H but look at this we get this idea God only deals with the preacher we get this idea that God only deals with the husband we get this idea that God only deals with the parents we get this idea that God only deals with someone else's family why don't we get the idea God called you is there any use here amen hallelujah amen amen we don't want to be unidentified right I was just asked to take a poll the other day and down there at the bottom are you white uh Hispanic black blah blah they had all these names or I unidentified and I looked at that and I just said here take your pole I am identified and I'm not identified with you sorry but you see this special class ability to hear from God that's right now my brother and sister I'm getting off track but that's fine we've got if the Lord comes tomorrow we don't have to worry about preaching it if he doesn't come for a long time we got plenty of time but look at this my brother and sister it takes an ability to hear from God I'll tell you what we need to do we need to teach our young people not all the doctrines we don't need to teach them about this is this and this deep thing over here and this is over here and this is why God sent a prophet we need to teach them how to hear from God because when they hear from God all of this other stuff will make sense but if we are trying to educate them into the message that they would come because they know what page in the seals book and what page in the church age book and what prophet said here but they don't have Revelation they can't live it amen amen but you get them to the point they know when God is dealing with them and it won't matter because God will speak to them amen no matter where they're at brother Flint uh will be aware of this I believe we were I was in Tac with you brother Flint at the time they shared the story of the grandfather I don't remember his name was in the hospital I believe it was in Bethal and God comes to him and he realizes what the word is he didn't have a book in his language he didn't speak English but he's laying there I believe it was a heart attack in the hospital and God gives him a vision and later when he shares that Vision to brother Andrew who spoke his language it's there and what it was was an unfolding right there he didn't need a b he didn't have a Bible he didn't have a church age book he didn't have the seals he didn't have all his things he had a desire for God Amen and God come to him and he got out of bed borrowed a snow machine from some relative of his and drove across I don't know if how far that is farther I'm going out in the cold amen and drove back there because he had to tell his people come on let's not start putting well this has to happen that has to happen this has to happen what we need to do is have an ability to hear from God it'll require Supernatural instruction what instruction now what's the problem I want to ask you this might be controversial I know where I stand on it instruction who's instructor God is who's he using we could argue who the instructor is instructor could be a pastor can be a brother sister teenager with a holy ghost experience be an instructor to other teenagers H come on that's right every one of us hear from God Supernatural instruction not just just a student comparing a verse with verse though that is good amen now but the mystery requires a teaching of the spirit or it never becomes clear how we need to hear from God and lay ourselves vulnerable now I want youall to go study the word vulnerable and you'll see why I'm throwing that in there do you realize very few of us are vulnerable amen I might have a hard time sitting down and telling you all of my complexes and all of the little issues of my life and all the doubts that wake me up in the middle of the night but when God makes you vulnerable that's when you open that's right and become yielded Lord I'm afraid Lord I'm confused I have unanswered questions I have something against a brother I recognize I don't have Brotherly Love come on it takes a vulnerable person one who will lay themselves over open amen amen amen that's right but what if I do how will people look at me well if you are looking or living or worshiping with a group of people and by God's grace the opening the opening the opening the opening the opening it will only be those who have remained closed who will be judgmental amen that's right it will be those that are closed that will be critical of you because everyone who has laid themselves bear will be saying Thank You Lord amen thank you Lord your power your majesty has come once again in our midst oh hallelujah amen well Saints don't want to disappoint any of you but we ain't even off page one amen sister Sarah come if you would please want to back up though what does that Top Line say but a mystery that's right requires not voluntary it requires I'll just give you a hint of what's farther down the pages you see there's a mystery of iniquity and a mystery of righteousness right amen it requires a teaching of the spirit that's right rightly divide the word of God to be able to allow and I'm going to abbreviate this I'm done once again the [Music] cups cup of iniquity filling up bitterness vanities Pride maybe serious stuff those are just Child's Play prophet of God says you know people murder people all the time now we're getting down serious right the shoplifter doesn't go to prison for 40 plus years no parole but the murderer does but God comes and through the mystery the manifestation of the mystery he pours righteousness in and iniquity fleas it oil and water and when the oil the spirit of God's poured in that dirty iniquity flows away and we can stand literally today and let's stand we can stand today and literally say I am free I am free the chains the bonds Satan's snares all broke free and the scripture says he who is free is free indeed Hallelujah well we'll just see what the Lord leads in the next week or two or three whatever I'll tell you what my brother and sister but what I want to tell you I want to read this last quote if you don't mind let's go to thirst brother amen I want I want you to leave here today with this as an encouragement to you not not a judgmental not as a wow what was he trying to say I want you to recognize this an encouragement like Paul said describes this in Romans 7:21 when I would do good then evil is I when you try did you ever have that inexperience Christians that when you were trying to do something that's worthwhile go make an effort to do something that's good that you find out that there is the devil on the every hand just to upset you everything everything you'd that's one good thing that I like to say this that the Christians might know that when you're when you are when you are starting to do something and there's something always trying to upset you in doing it give up go home get an attitude towards that person they never liked me anyhow no sir what's he say Saints amen do it anyhow oh no this is not sending out an email telling you everybody how bad everybody is that's not the do it anyhow he's talking about that's the devil they're trying to keep you from doing what's right now I'll tell you what I relate to what the Apostle Paul said when I would do good evil is present with me amen it's the constant battle that we have as humans but I'm telling you my brother and sister recognize that's not your nature to give up it's not your nature to say I'm finished it's not your nature to say this is too much for me it's not your nature your nature is to say my God is Invincible my God is mighty he's powerful amen he is all and all to me amen he is everything the lily of my Valley the bright and Morning Star he's the strength he's my rock he's who I am and that nature is in me hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah oh my oh my hallelujah hallelujah what song is that Sister Sarah let's sing that sounds good sounds [Music] good how great are you Lord oh how great is your [Music] mercy how great are the things you somebody ought to be able to say Amen to that oh great things Lord You've Done how great are you Lord for your loving [Music] kindness oh it's filling

today we serve a great God that's right and you know because a great God is in you right DNA amen so you know research of DNA shows that DNA shows [Music] up in your mind Hallelujah and DNA shows up in your heart the two principal places that God deals with us and the DNA of another shows up there Hallelujah clearly identified who we are that's right I've got his DNA in me amen it's I'm not worried about my toenail I'm not worried about if it shows up in my hair or not I need it my mind I need it my heart Hallelujah yep Hallelujah Redeemed by the blood of the Lamb 556 brother Gideon amen
