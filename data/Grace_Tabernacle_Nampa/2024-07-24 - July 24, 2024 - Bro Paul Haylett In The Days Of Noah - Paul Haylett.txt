you tonight I'll speak to you tonight on on the subject of scarecrows revealed in the scripture and um we'll see all down Through the Ages how that the word has always taken that negative spirit that that doubting that fear that anxiety and it's always exposed it and uh I say thank you Lord for that that by God's grace and mercy that we uh we don't have to live with that we don't have to uh uh spend all the days of our Liv struggling to to overcome but we can by God's grace was that not plugged in or there's oh well okay probably operator air you'll notice I walked out and sat down and went to scratched my ear and went huh where's the mic and I had to get up and go get the anyway that kind of evening amen this reminds us all we're very human amen so we look at this uh uh scarecrow is revealed in the scripture and uh so as we look at as it was in the days of Noah we know the scripture we'll just start off and take part of this in Genesis the 6th chapter and um we'll take this and and uh just I hope enjoy this evening to realize the the beauty of what God is is uh given to us revealed to us but it's not just revealed to us it's revealed in US and uh so we're sitting here today the word being manifested and you know it's interesting in in my studies I I look at a little different things maybe a little different way than some because we're all individual but my brother and sister lately I've been digging into um how how is how is the rest of the world looking at the word for the hour uh looking at the word concerning themselves in this hour and uh what they believe God will and won't do and um it's kind of startling remember I read the quote where brother Brown says now uh the man was saying why why do they send uh them to Seminary to destroy the gospel and um we truly that is just coming to pass more and more and more I uh um uh was um looking at a little deal and in that the state of Oklahoma has actually passed a rule a law if you would call it uh that they need to reintroduce the Bible back into their public schools and the public schools are saying we absolutely refuse we won't do it and then this will sound harsh forgive me but I'm just telling you like I saw it then they interviewed Jezebel who happened to be pastoring a church in the town of one of those big schools and she's there dangling earrings bright red lips dressed to the nines as they might refer to it and she's like well I agree we shouldn't put the Bible back in the school cuz we don't know what version and the versions have erors and until we can understand and go back into the old Hebrew and the aramic and and figure out where they made their mistakes we wouldn't know what to teach the children M the word is coming to pass it's coming to the place that they don't really want they don't really want to they want the form of godliness and they're going to deny the absolute power of it scripture is coming to pass and I didn't share that as negative connotation but I I believe we should be somewhat aware of the signs of the times of what's happening around us uh we we don't want to you know be the one that's just blindsided I had no idea these things were happening but we don't focus on that right we're focused on the revealed word of God and and what it's a how it's affecting us because we have a word that we know what it means we know we were called to manifest it and we're not sitting here is spending our lives imagine now some of you would do well to learn aramic and Hebrew Brother David is a perfect example of that what about poor Paul I I I wouldn't get off first bace does that mean I should just quit serving God now cuz I don't know no that's not what it's about amen Genesis 6 the starting with the fifth verse and God saw that the wickedness of man was great in the earth and that every imagination of the thoughts of his heart was only evil continually and it repented the Lord that he might that he made man on the earth and it grieved him at his heart and the Lord said I will destroy man man whom I have created from the face of the Earth both man and Beast and the creeping thing the fowls of the air for it repenteth me that I have made them but Noah now my brother and sister we can come right down in this 2024 21st century and you'll put your name right here in verse eight amen but Noah found Grace I'll give you a moment just to put your your name in there amen but no Noah found Grace in the eyes of the Lord and these are the generations of Noah Noah was a just man and perfect in his generations and Noah walked with God if we could just absolutely focus on that right there Noah was just our brother how many times did Brother brandham declare I'm just your brother amen Noah was just our brother but he finding Grace in the eyes of the Lord walked with God was perfect in his Generations we can be such we are such not can be we are such amen and Noah begat Three Sons sham ham and japheth and the Earth was also was corrupt before God and the Earth was filled with violence and God looked upon the Earth and behold it was corrupt for All Flesh had corrupted his way upon the Earth and God said unto Noah the end of All Flesh has come before me for the Earth is filled with violence through them and behold I will destroy them with the Earth make thee an ark of gopher wood and rooms shalt thou make in the ark and shall pitch it within and without with pitch and this is the fashion which Thou shalt make it of the length of the Ark shall be 300 cubits and the breadth of it 50 cubits and the height of it 30 cubits a window shalt thou make to the ark and in a cubit shalt thou finish it above and the door of the Ark shalt thou set in the side thereof with the lower second and third stories shalt thou make it Heavenly Father we ask you Lord just to come bless our time together tonight in the word Lord we thank you for the opportunity and by your grace and mercy Lord we will be able to thoroughly identify with Noah tonight Lord we thank you and your precious name amen you may be seated and as we look at this we'll see uh not to do away with uh these other scriptures but uh it is declaring that he going to bring a flood and it's going to destroy and in that he's going to establish a covenant and in that Covenant my brother and sister now you can say the Lord promised not to to uh flood the Earth in that fashion again but let's just realize when God makes a covenant or a promise he he doesn't have to come down and make it so specific when he said that uh I I have called you he didn't need to name our names because our names are already in him amen so it's a part of the word coming forth and so it's going to be that every beast and everything that would come and you know it's interesting because the naysayers and we would like to think it's just simply uh uh uh within the realm of the naysayers but when you think about the size of the Ark and you think about all the animals there was something Supernatural took place at the ark amen it wasn't simply let's let's take dimensions and figure out uh Mast displaced and and there's no way you can fit it all inside the ark my brother and sister but when you serve a supernatural God and he says this is what I want it to be and you are going to all the animals and the animals are going to come and them animals walk through the door something Supernatural took place in every single one of those now if we have a God that can create Heaven and Earth he can fit the animals in an ark amen hallelujah cuz the greater mystery would be how that this planet hung in space can rotate and and all the mass and motion and everything so perfectly is much greater than the fact of how the animals fit in the ark amen but what we want to focus here just for a few minutes tonight is the fact that the Earth was corrupt before God and it was filled with violence it certainly sounds like the Earth today it sounds like a perfect uh picture uh of the day that we're looking and uh it was corrupt All Flesh was corrupted uh in his way on the earth and you know as it is God is is showing or speaking to Noah and uh we see how that uh Noah then starts he he proceeds forward he has a few doubts he has a little anxiety you know God's choice uh uh of uh the wood and everything in the hindsight Looks So Perfect up front it looked like a very poor choice of a wood that was so soft a wood that was so porous that water would flow right through it but God oh I hope you catch this God knows how to seal amen he knows how to seal he he doesn't have to worry about the sealing of it amen and when he come right down in this day amen they were worried about a little water but today we're worried about the spirits of the age and all of the things the schemes of Satan and God comes down says I know exactly what I have done because I know how to seal that I know how to make that to where they become as it were impervious to the world are we influenced my brother and sister we're influenced I I don't think any one of us could deny that we've had times of anxiety and times that maybe we woke up in the middle of the night and didn't go back to sleep because our mind is racing about how to deal with this and do this and do this and and trouble in the land and all of these things but I tell you one thing that we can stand solid on when God said I sealed you you're sealed amen we don't have to worry about whether this boat will float amen because he has sealed us amen now let's look at Noah for just a few minutes we know that Noah was a devout man we know that God would uh uh take him and use him in the way that God would because he had prepared Noah to be the man of the hour the man that he called to fulfill that he didn't he didn't just say look there's nobody in the land that that I can use there's no one who can fulfill this position so I guess I will settle for a second second best and I would like you just ponder that and apply it to your own life tonight God did not settle for a second best when he called his bride in this age amen he didn't say well I guess there's not the ones I really would like to you know call the ones that were really smart the ones that were really this or really that but God said I know exactly what I'm choosing and I will seal that vessel and it will take that soul to the other side amen I say thank you Lord am amen so a a devout man he applied the word now I I can speak with Liberty on this my brother and sister because uh God doesn't have two standards or three standards or four standards a standard for my I you know some of us would brother Trevor would just flunk out all the way the standard for the good-look standard for the smart good for the rich or you know for the what he he doesn't have a bunch of standard he's got one standard and he knows that we have the ability he put the ability in us to meet that standard amen so he he doesn't have to do it and that's why we should just kick away every excuse that we use that I'm not good enough I'm not spiritual enough I'm not smart enough I'm not whatever because God knew exactly what he was using cuz he didn't want to seal you with your flesh he wanted to seal you with his holy spirit amen he didn't want to seal uh seal the uh that uh sham wood or that gopher wood he didn't want to seal that with with something like you know Oak that swole up and so tight it wouldn't leak because it was a big storm my brother and sister there was a scientist did a little research considering those things and he he said I'm not making a point of this but by studying this engineering wise he said there may well have been waves 200 feet tall on the ocean on the sea when the ark was was there it wasn't just some little gentle ride it was a a wild ride a a great tumultous time and he wanted something amen that was flexible but sealed amen oh my Noah had applied the token amen no way short of it if God allowed Noah to get by not applying the token he would have to allow you and I to get by without applying the token so we know that no Noah had applied the token we know that the word was centermost of of their home and um they were living it he was living it amen God didn't come down and settle for second best and so you know as it is I can just see Noah I preached on Noah the brother the man you know just uh the whole thing before God anointed us to speak on that times past and you know he got up in the morning and you know maybe he was going down the street and a man who had been a scoffer had come along and now his wife or his child is sick and where he used to think Noah was just this overly religious man he's now in a state of desperation and Noah would you pray for my wife or my child Noah goes in lays hands on him prays for him and God comes on this scene but how many times did we see in the prophet's Ministry people come through the prayer line and they come there and pray for them and they are healed and they went out and never once looked back to the word they got what they wanted and they just moved on so you know that might have been the same effect I believe it would be he was testifying of the things of God to friends and to family because you see he was called to be the living Epistle of his day he was called to be Christ on display he was called to be the one that they would not be able to deny that they had been warned and they had seen Christ moving amen seen God moving whatever words you want to use uh in their midst they can't deny it it was real it was alive and they heard it what God was doing and you know uh just uh not to make too long a scenario but Noah it become very obvious brother Noah was not just a churchgoer there was something taking place in his life and this is all my brother and sister before God comes and says I want you to preach a message this is this is everyday life this is not just a special moment for a moment but it's him being called to that you see as the prophet has told us Noah was the word for that hour and we are here amen the spirit and the bride say come the bride has a Ministry has a voice she's alive she's speaking and it's real it's not just a serade it's not just a story it's real amen she's speaking in this generation in this time and as they would look at Noah they would be saying you know old Noah just used to go to church just like us he wasn't any different than us but something's changing with Noah and some would Marvel and some would scoff but it doesn't matter that's exactly what God was calling amen and I want to ask you this question does God change his pattern God does not change his word amen and I can say today praise the Lord he doesn't change cuz if he could change he could decide tomorrow it was mentioned right in the song service from before the foundation of the world if he could change we have no Assurance we'd wake up tomorrow morning and we were still called from the foundation of the world Amen God bless you Sister Carrie you see if if it was changeable we'd have no security at all we we would walk around the most nervous people we'd have a bad thought or a bad attitude and we'd be oh it's all over and we'd quit but we have a word in this hour that says when God called you he has prepared you and he will finish this work in you and there's no other alternative for us to stand on amen we know where we stand today now the Marvel that I find so wonderful about this and and here again I don't mean to sound critical but the world said oh no no there's a new covenant and it's all by Grace now so I can live however I want to and God's going to understand but I'm telling you my brother and sister the bride under the anointed word she's living and she makes a mistake and she knows what to do and she knows that God has placed the word in her and what does she do as the prophet of God said when you do wrong and the Holy Spirit speaks to you you stop right there and you make it right and then when we don't it's the devil that's there trying to keep you give you an excuse well they deserved it they started it it's their fault that's not what the prophet said he said the Holy Spirit speaks to you you go take care of that there is a separation line between the anointing on the denominational spirit and anointing on the bride spirit is the bride wants to be right at the moment she doesn't want Grace Grace Grace right off to fall off into disgrace so she's there and we see that Noah was living this word before those people in that hour and then God comes along and says no I've got a message I want you to speak they already maybe thought he was pretty zealous but something changes and Noah stands out amongst his brother amongst his friends the fellow church members God spoke to me you know in this day and age pardon me when I tell you sometimes I look very far and wide in my studies I I'm I'm serious I look far and wide do you know in this day and age God speaks to everybody I was looking at a deal this guy became a pastor of a church after he had an affair with the church secretary and divorced his wife and then he got married the the secretary and then they got along and this went this way and then they voted him in as the pastor cuz God told him to that's not the god of our Bible the prophet would no wonder they thought he was harsh he said that's the God of this evil age you you've got the you've got the gods mixed up and so it's there that we see how it's introduced to them and all of a sudden people that they used to sit down at the barbecue with are like you know Noah is going too far he now thinks that God told him it's going to rain I'm wondering if we should ask ask a doctor to get him evaluated but they didn't know really what to do because it was a supernatural element that came with Noah's ministry right amen have we seen a prophet with a supernatural element amen God does not change his ways my brother and sister so here is Noah with a supernatural element but he is now speaking things they can't hardly comprehend amen and so as it is that he's he's in this position of really honestly a living epistle before these people they can't really put a fault to his life he is a righteous man a holy man he's a caring man a praying man and they can't put a finger to his life but you know as God is speaking to him and says I've got a message for you go and preach it amen there was a change in Noah yes sir Noah didn't say I think I'll go change God's speaking to me I'll just change no the word the word himself speaking to Noah started to change him oh Hallelujah can somebody say thank you Lord when you spoke to me Lord it started to change my life I'm not who I used to be amen I don't even want to look back to what I used to be I want to be what the word says I am amen and so it's it's there this change taking place in Noah now my brother and sister let me put it to you this way people like religion until it interferes with their life and at that point they have a hard time dealing with religion now let's just be honest with ourselves there's been times since we come to the word that the word has cut us and we have said I don't like that but there was something inside of you that says that wasn't the preacher that wasn't this person that wasn't husband or wife it wasn't me that's right Supernatural element coming down now remember the quote we read to the other day brother Brown says they only put the Scarecrow up where the good fruit is amen so you can see now that here is Noah and the scarecrows start popping up Noah went too far he got into that reading his Bible and doing this stuff and praying way too much and he slipped over the edge if he had just settled down with going to church he already was on this board or that board or whatever if he to just been happy there but he went too far he got in too much he he thought God actually talked to him God doesn't talk to humans let's just settle for just a little religion amen we want to do that tonight if we were settling for a little bit of religion right now we could actually dismiss right now and we could meet at Dairy Queen and many would be satisfied with that oh it was good what did they preach on well I don't know I spent most of the time you know whatever but it was good so Noah becoming a Fanatic in the eyes of the people people they're starting to see something strange about his behavior and Noah is speaking to them and it is such an incredible message that Noah is speaking that the people cannot comprehend it they're like what what are you talking about God is speaking to you God is revealing to you God's gave you a personal message to give to us why didn't he speak to us we're just as spiritual as you are Noah and it comes down that they're looking at this and as he becomes a Fanatic in the eyes of the people so many people pull back we don't want to get caught up in fanaticism now I hope this doesn't offend anybody me putting it this way but when you hear people say well I'm afraid in this message I'm afraid of being deceived they're already deceived they have not come to the place to know who they are in Jesus Christ they're wavering on the boundary they've got religion not the Holy Ghost because when God speaks to you speaks to me speaks to us let's do it Collective speaks to us he gives us an assurance of who we are we're not going to go 20 30 40 years looking for a Rapture the whole time am I saved or not am I saved or not is the message true or not my brother and sister you don't have to go far out here in denomination to see the nonsense that's invaded the churches amen I I'm sorry I shouldn't even say some of this over the pulpit so maybe I should restrain myself but when you have people who can't even figure out their natural human identity teaching your children what they are they AR teaching them their sons and daughters of God they're teaching them pronouns amen what is it that Satan has come right down in the church and they hang the colors and they do all of this and they quote whatever I can't remember remember the guy's name probably he's good don't need to advertise him they quote that as much as they quote the scripture but when they quote the scripture they'll put a little addendum on there and we're not sure this is correct that's [Music] right no his message was so incredible they're like this can't be true this just this can't be true we have history we have history going back that was in the old days now it seems kind of different for us right be talking about Noah and the old days when we would be looking back but isn't that the truth of the age oh God did that back then he doesn't do that now remember the spirits never die they've just morphed from age to age to age and so he's got this incredible message how God come spoke to him and it stunned the people now my brother and sister when you look at this as you study and you listen to the prophet you'll see my brother and sister that there were many people that shouted I I have little documentations here and there people that sit on the platform and brother bram's meeting and amen and walked out the door and criticized him come on the spirit doesn't change and when they went out and criticized look think about it wasn't that uh help me Brother David which one of was those meetings where brother Brown said now you guys talked about this in the back room and you and you and you were there Chicago that's what I first wanted to say but then I was thinking was that De Moine but you look at that my brother and sister see these men sat there and shouted under the anointing of the Holy Spirit and then they went out and cut brother Bram to shreds and brother Brenham just was there and he knew it that's one thing remarkable we'd probably most of us have to say look you lion cheating person brother Brown called him brother that's right because he knew what the word was and I say this a little direct he knew what they were amen imagine Jesus is there in the temple right in front of the religious leaders and they said you're be the greatest gift given to mankind is standing in their presence their discernment says you're be elub and you know it comes along I I just believe this firmly because the types I believe follow through Noah is there it got to a point they started to say you know what you've got an evil spirit on you you're deceiving the people trying to get them into your church this this Arc church that's it they you're you're trying to get them to join your group and then you're going to like hold them captive because you got a door on that place right so it's it's coming closer time is going on Noah never got discouraged Noah never questioned Noah I'm sorry my brother and sister it don't hold the type he was human and there had to be days that Noah was like Lord is I'm not sure I understood you am I doing this right come on aren't we human that's right Lord and I'm not talking about unbelief like Lord you're you're just messing with me no the days when when the masses come on we are humans my brother and sister you know if you're walking now I'm not saying this fits everyone you're walking through the woods just on a casual walk not hunting not trying to get away from every you're just on a walk it's human nature that we come to a a a a split in the trail and that one's just got a few footprints on it and we tend to follow the one that the masses have walked is that what we're doing I trust we're not you see the masses my brother and sister said Jesus was be elob the masses listened to the high priest and said this can't be true Our Father s they know and so it becomes a group a voice raising up Noah stop your preaching Noah be quiet you want to build an ark go build it around the corner out of sight but leave the people alone because you're confusing them and Noah he was following One Voice amen amen not the multitude of voices not a dozen voices not a group there he was there God told me to preach this message whether it's accepted or not and I I'm just sorry I just have to put it this way and we've all studied this and we've documented this and we all are in agreement he went off in the end who's we all who's the group I don't recommend you do this but I'll just State this as a fact to you a lot of research and people writing about brother brandham today quote the same resources over and over and over again in fact you won't go in the Rapture unless you accept brandom's teaching hope that doesn't shock you all not going in the Rapture unless you accept and I don't say this to disrespect but I'm saying what they say unless you accept brandom's teaching my goodness my goodness if they would ever pick this book up and they would ever say Lord open this book to me they would have to change that you're not going in the Rapture until you believe Jesus is teaching right God's teaching the holy spirit's teaching but they're quoting I hope you follow me here they're quoting the same reference over and over and over and over again and saying they must know they speak five languages they have LLS inde DED this and that and whatever and you know that's what we need to do so we're going to quote them and they're wrong those people were right there with Noah Noah is right there being battered with this and their many Ministry of the masses was so effective it come right down to just a little group now scripturally you can see it was Noah's family but we can enlarge that to realize what family we all belong to amen so it's there that that that Ministry anti- message Ministry was so effective that it just whittel the people one at a time Noah you know we've been friends I trust you with my life but this has went too far there's just no way it's going to rain amen I got a quote here I need to hurry along but you know brother Brown speaks about this we've already shot the instruments into space there's not enough moisture out there for it to rain you're wrong Noah and we have the science to prove it they had incredible doubt and they were anointed to dispute there's a push back you know it's hard to imagine when you're a Believer it's hard to imagine people anointed to disbelieve as much as you're anointed to belief I mean we come can't you see this here it is in the word but they're anointed and you're a supernatural anointed individual to take a hold of that word and there as a prophet of God's talking about reading between the lines that's not to become a professional oh there's got to be something right here something right here no that's when the word speaks to you and says this is connected to this and this is connected to this and this is connected to this and this is where it comes together and it takes a supernatural anointing to receive that and you did amen what does that tell you it means there's a supernatural anointing on your life amen and so as these these voices you know the doubts start to rise and they're able to put pieces together and then they get a spirit to dispute my brother and sister I don't want to dispute with anybody else I actually just want to live what God called me to live and you live what you were called to live and as brother George Smith says we'll meet you in the end that's really where I'm at but you see there's an anointing to dispute there's anointing to argue anointing to misconstrue the word of God that's right remember we went through that about misplacing misconstruing twisting it they're anointed to twist it to end up winning but they're losing while they're winning my oh how many voices how many voices Noah you're a false prophet it's not going to happen Noah and some never did their own research isn't it strange how that Spirit comes down well so and so said really did so and so study it till they hadn't well no this individual told them and where did they get it did they exhaustively study the word no this person told them and it gets down here and we can make a footnote in a book and say our reference point that he went off in the end is this person who never once had a personal relationship oh I was talking about Noah's day was there a similarity okay okay I just want to make sure you guys knew I was talking about Noah's day amen strange how that all comes down isn't it that it just fits so perfect through the scripture just comes and you know what every one of these had in common they were a scarecrow amen every one of them had an influence to cause someone to quit and if they didn't quit did you know that you can become so paralyzed that your body will not react so paralyzed that your thoughts congeal reminds me a little story I don't say this just for the deal but this this man had had been out hunting and when he come back he was all agitated all sweaty just All Shook Up and they're like what happened and he said I was out there on the trail and this Giant mountain lion jumped out in the trail in front of me and I emptied my rifle I fired every shell at him and then he ran off I I don't know he has to be wounded which means he'll probably you know attack somebody and they said okay take us back to the place this happened so maybe we can find blood or track this do you know what they were found when they got there they found his shoe prints all scuffed in the dirt and they found eight unfired rifle cartridges laying on the ground because in his paralysis he stood there and went and his mind said I shot over and over and over my you say how does that fit brother Paul well people under that anointing believe they've done so much for God and the reality of it is all the evidence right there they were spending their re tires whatever phrase you want to use and ultimately didn't we do many mighty works in your name and he says depart from me you worker of iniquity just like the man on the trail accomplishing nothing and this is the spirit Noah was dealing with they weren't doing anything at least Noah is building an ark they're all scarecrows right because they're trying to keep Noah and the people even his own family Noah himself from moving on doing what he called to do amen and it is in the age that we live in indecision is keeping many from the promise it's called spiritual paralysis amen now in Paradox amen let's just move forward on on this brother Alex I'm yeah oh okay I'll let you do the work look at this Noah got ready for it I'd imagine in his preparation times that the people said wonder what that old crank is having out there up there pounding away with an old wooden ship it's never rained there's no such thing I'd imagine science would come out to Noah and say lookie here we have instruments that we can shoot to the uh shoot the stars and there's no rain up there how in the world can your words be true when it's going to rain and there's no water up there we have no evidence that there was an angel stood right here until you read an account from someone who isn't even a message believer and said when they walked up they couldn't go any closer because there was something there but they're just old unbeliever that's so appreciative that they were prayed for and got healed that that that that's discounted because that spirit will walk how's that go now walk uh hob nail shoes I I was trying to grasp the they'll walk yeah yeah there it is thank you brother DAV my mind just couldn't quite grab a hold so walk H nail shoes the crudest form of shoes there are Where Angels won't even go they'd come and say No Nonsense nonsense Noah pushed back a lot my brother and sister I think we ought to have a little more respect for Noah amen there scarecrows all over over the place they surrounded that Ark amen and as he's putting the finished touches on the ark no doubt they are there like what are you talking about you you have wasted all this time all this resource if you had gave this to the church we could have had a great Mission program well that was a pretty awesome Mission program amen amen I'd imagine science come out Noah says look here we have instruments can shoot the moon the stars there's no rain up there how in the world can your words be true they just called him a liar now what when it's going to rain and there's no water up there but you see if God has said it said it was going to rain he can make rain if God says I'm your healer that's it you're healed that's it God says I'll deliver you you're delivered that's right and God says I'll bless you come on my brother and sister I think we've so limited God even though we have the word of the hour we've so limited God that we would be shocked out of our mind if our oil and our meal did never go away we'd be like going okay this is some kind of what my brother and sister I think Satan has pulled a quick one on us where we have an expectation that yes God can do this but it's almost like we need to add the deal will he he can but will he well we ought to be here tonight to say he can and he will amen if we have that need God would look down and say that's my son that's my daughter I can heal them and I want to heal them I can provide for them and I will provide for them amen it's no longer as stand here and say oh that happened over there but we are looking in the hour today that we are living my brother and sister and there is an ark that has been built in this generation amen calling us into his safety calling us into his Security will we get in that Ark Hallelujah I I'm not putting that as a question but it it's there my brother and sister it's the same thing that face Noah is facing you and I we've got a message to preach with our life if not with words but with our life and we've been called to give an offener ark to others Amen to offer it to our fam you see it was irrelevant what his children did after the fact God didn't say Noah you failed Noah did what God called him to do hallelujah amen it's so same today the message is too incredible for the masses even Mormons who believe in Prophets struggle a little bit God sent a prophet to you guys no he only sends them to us no no I'm sorry our Prophet fits within the Bible your Prophet had to write his own book to fit into it h and people sorry to be redundant but people think their worship is correct because it's well accepted amen just because there's a majority doesn't make it right that's right look this is a part that some people struggle I I've had friends turn back to the world from the message over this right here because a real relationship with Christ brings separation that's right now we're not talking about rejecting your neighbor acting like they don't exist your family members acting like they don't exist not talking about that kind of Separation it's from separation of the world now when the message was misconstrued many years ago that was preached in such that you reject your mama and your daddy cuz that's what the word says but they took it so far out of context they they brought it to a place that was so and and alienated families and then wondered why the families had animosity that's right instead of saying that's your mama your daddy that's right that's your children andun Uncle go live it in front of them amen go be Christ in the flesh that they can touch be Christ in the flesh that they'll sooner or later say what makes you tick amen and then you can say thank you for asking amen and then you can start to share this but instead it's like nope we're called to be separate you guys either believe this I can't tell you how many times this a kid I witness this now if you don't believe this your serpent seed you're going to hell I can remember the little town of green leaf the church is right there in Green Leaf I want to tell you Saints they did more damage to the message in that Community right there with that kind of nonsense so you believe God sent a prophet what do you mean God sent a prophet I don't understand what you're doing look either Believe it or don't because if you don't and people would be like they're crazy instead we should have been out there building an ark come on in come see what it is come see if it's real or not study it see if it fits the scripture instead they stood at the end of the ramp give them a word test that's it when they themselves didn't live the word they were giving word that would be like Paul teaching English H and algebra and Gi geography and history you imagine the wreck we would have and that's what happened they were teaching man's concept the church was saying denominational that's false and the people took it at face value because after all it's Noah who went off in the end and a real relationship bring real relationship with Christ brings preparation I'm going to close here Revelations 19:7 and 8 we know the scripture let us be glad and rejoice somebody rejoicing tonight amen and give honor amen for the marriage of the Lamb has come and his wife hath made herself ready this is what was happening it didn't matter what they said over here didn't matter what they said over there this little wife has come down and said I know this is the truth it's a revelation to me and I'm just going to be prepared just going to make myself ready and what do I have to lose what do I have to lose being ready for a Rapture and we get old and we get feeble and we pass to the grave and the Rapture never took place so is all our preparation for the Rapture wasted no sir because the Rapture is actually drawing us into the presence of Christ so whether we come and walk Amen Alive and remain or whether we pass from this life into the presence that preparation is what brings us into the presence of the Lord amen there's no wasted effort oh my let me hurry here now I'll just preach it real quick Matthew 24:34 through 38 it's talking about there the days of Noah so shall it be at the coming of the Sant of man and we we see this evidence around us my brother and sisters such violence such such perversion uh and I always used to think that the perversion would be restricted to the perverts sorry to put it that blunt but it's become wholesale now it's become accepted it's a way of life my my I listened to a policeman was in charge of a certain unit within a big city police deal and he said if we arrested all of the perverted people in this city we'd have to start at City Hall come on this is not a bottom up thing it's a top down thing amen it's there I I hope I'm not out of line with you now uh let's go to Ministry explain there brother Alex sorry move on on you I believe the coming of Jesus Christ is drawing nigh I believe that you if you want to call that fanaticism just go ahead and Mark me a fanatic and we say Amen because I believe in the literal physical coming of Jesus the second time and I believe it's drawing nigh and now and I believe we just have a short time to work and I believe that this Universal Revival that's sweeping the lands today is the indication of the message like it was in the days of of Noah while men and women were rioting in sin and Noah had a fanatic gospel that he preached but he called the people to an Ark of Safety to those rioting in sin it was fanaticism but to you it was life to you it was the word of personal relationship amen and and I believe that glorious Gospel of the Son of God manifested by the Holy Ghost is sweeping the country today bringing people into the ark which is Christ Jesus safely secured from all the judgments the ceiling amen safely secured from all the judgments that's going to come and when the Judgment strikes the earth and the atomic Powers Rock the Nations we'll ride above the waves into Glory I believe it and I'm here to say tonight I believe it and I believe that there's been a little church that's been called Fanatics for a long time and now I do realize there is Fanatics certainly there is there's plenty of them but a little church that's tried to struggle not to be a certain denomination or a certain name but I mean peoples who love God isn't this what it's coming down to my brother and sister oh we have the best pastor we have the best Choir The Best Song program the biggest church we have this that or the other no my brother and sisters coming down to a love affair with Jesus Christ amen and in that love affair you're not going to to burn that out of them you can chop their head off you can throw them off the cliff on the Rock none of that will change it because they know exactly who they are and where they stand hallelujah amen and it's held out amen but I mean people who love God and it's held out for the supernatural now bear with me right now I've preached almost too long it's a little bit warm in here at least it is up here do you feel Supernatural right now h no but you know that you are Supernatural there's the separation that's coming that's right I don't go by feel I go by revelation ation of the word that the Lord has showed me I am Supernatural from beginning I don't know how far back is before the foundation of the world interesting question but right into eternity we're Supernatural not what we feel not oh I feel so Supernatural today look I don't want to sound boastful but ministers here and and others too I've laid hands on people and witnessed God answer their prayer and heal them right in the laying of hands before your eyes and we have prayed for needs for years that's right and not saw them now which one are we going to say is Supernatural pray for somebody and they get healed and they back slide and go out in the world but living in this state that we think is sad their desperation serve God the Lord takes them home I talked to a brother the other day I won't give the whole scenario to you but he laid a scenario out he says now Paul if this and this happens and in this case it was actually a scenario of money and if they're a $5,000 person he was referring to monthly 5,000 a month that pays their bills they raise their family their clothes they they pay their ties they give their offerings and then we decide we're helping this man and we help him to earn $20,000 a month any backslides who is responsible you see if we did and not God if we tried to fix the problem and didn't leave it to the Lord we're responsible then the brother turned that and he says and if we have the word which is worth a million and we won't share it who's responsible you see this is not a game we're playing Noah he didn't play a game the day come God told him you call them they'll come imagine you call it and here comes two groundhogs and you realize there's no groundhogs live in your neighborhood and imagine you call for a zebra zebras are cool and zebras come and March right in there they don't Bonk they don't run sister Jerry and I have been in Africa we've seen zebra zebra mamas that even you looking at their baby we would try to nudge forward in the vehicle to look at the baby and the mama would be right there I can see her trigonometry taking place angle and she's a half a step forward you still can't see the baby you back up a little bit can't see the baby pull Way Forward can't see the baby now if God would put that in an animal imagine a zebra just coming here's my ticket imagine here's the bride brother Trevor here's my ticket it's called the word I'm out of here I've got an ark I've got a place of safety I don't have to worry about a balm shelter reminds me of a time I believe that was in Missouri these this family they had moved from out west southwest they moved to Missouri and and they were afraid of tornadoes and so they paid this company to build and bury this big tornado shelter underground and here comes a tornado coming right down the state highway looks like it's coming right to their house and they run out there and they go to go down the steps and here's a big old water mckas and they turned to each other they were Christians they turned to each other said well let's go stand stand in the bathroom doorway and pray no no my brother and sister we don't need what man can provide our Arc is here the door is open we've been called to enter in hallelujah amen well I hope yall didn't mind me me just having fun preaching tonight amen hallelujah brother Alex if you had come got one last quote if y'all don't mind amen modern events made clear been a lot of argument in the message in the last while I'm going to just be blunt is this Pentecostal move some are saying if you don't have this Pentecostal move your church is dead and others are saying if you're acting like Pentecostals you're kind of fanatic and there's a lot of little bickering in these circles that are out here and I'm not going to settle this argument tonight but I am going to take what the prophet said and stand on that amen he said we're not living in a Pentecostal age we're living in another age see we're not living in the Methodist age we're living in another age we're living on up here in the bride age the calling out of the church and getting it together for the Rapture that's the age that we're now living to my honest opinion that's exactly the truth and this book is a book of Prophecy its Believers are commanded to honor it and and to read it and believe its author for every word that's written in there must come to pass Can someone say Amen everything that's been promised has to come to pass because it is Jesus Christ in each age oh my amen the same yesterday it was Jesus Christ was in Noah it was Jesus Christ in Moses it was Jesus Christ in David it was Jesus Christ in Joseph it's Jesus Christ the same yesterday today and forever it's Jesus Christ among his people today amen doing the things that he promised he would do in this age it's Jesus Christ Hallelujah aren't you glad today you can lift a hand and say it's Jesus Christ in me amen I am in him and he is in me and there's no scarecrow that same scarecrow that tried to detour Noah has come right down Through the Ages and I don't know I might preach on every one of these scarecrows I've dug out of the scripture but I don't want it to become a redundant because it really is the same story all over again God coming on the scene God speaks and the scarecrows start popping up out of nowhere right you know they're like well it was Luther and it was Wesley no it was God it was our Lord Jesus Christ amen that was him speaking these men are just men they made such a thing of Thunders oh he's got it anointing anointing anointing well if God didn't speak to him it'll flop it'll fall on its face but when God speaks and who's he using I'm going to throw the spin on you right here he's using Brother Paul praise God he's such a well no actually I'm thinking he's using you it's himself using you you are a manifestation of the the Thunders in this day amen no $55,000 suits no Rolexes no big lifting up everybody woo no you humble unnoticed walking down the street living amen that's what they got in Noah's age the fact they couldn't accept it was their problem and that's what's happening in this age and the fact they can't accept it will be their problem but that doesn't give us permission to be arrogant or narcistic or all those other definitive words amen okay I'll stop amen let's just stand sing a couple songs if you don't mind amen I know it was the blood number eight amen that's where we stand tonight we know how we got here my brother and sister we we know what's brought us to this place in time amen they can say it's fanaticism well that's not going to affect me cuz it's not fanaticism to me it's reality Hallelujah I know it was the blood oh I know it was the blood I know it was the blood for me one day when Paul was lost he died upon the cross and I know it was the blood for me oh there's power in the blood Power in the Blood there's power in the blood for me one day when I was lost he died upon the cross there's power in the blood for me oh there healing in the blood claim it tonight healing in the blood there's healing in the blood for me one day when I was lost oh he died upon the cross there's healing in the blood for me well I know it was the blood I know it was was the blood I know it was the blood for me one day when I was lost he died upon the cross I know it was the blood for me 215 brother Ivan amen whose report
