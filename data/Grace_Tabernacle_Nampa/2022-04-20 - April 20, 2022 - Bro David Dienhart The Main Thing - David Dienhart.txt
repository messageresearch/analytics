that i spoke with brother barry today sent him the video he seemed excited to share it so looking to hopefully hear good news good response back but send it over to our pastor today and he wanted to give you all a chance to see it in its complete form so we're going to play that here in a second um i feel like i'm forgetting something oh that's right because of the situation we're going to pause the streaming so anybody that's streaming we apologize ahead of time but we're going to pause the streaming while we watch the the film so yeah enjoy it love this show and those that helped out with that that's just that's really beautiful i trust a blessing for them an encouragement for them amen as we get ready to turn the service brother david let's sing 196 ksc cover me [Music] cover [Music] extend the borders thy garment over me for thought [Music] [Applause] [Music] me cover me one more time oh cover me up david [Music] extend the borders of thy garment over me for thou art my nearest [Music] amen i'm glad he has a covering provided for us the enemy can't break through that covering amen he's covered us aren't you happy to be covered by the blood covered by the life of the of christ himself you know what brother sister don't tear to don't try to trim that covering because as soon as you try to trim it you're as good as shaving amen you say well brother now that's the hair yeah that's the woman's covering that's right natural cover that's a woman's covering what about the bride's cover bride's covering is his whole life don't dare try to trim that because either you get in or you get out amen leave it leave it alone amen god bless you we're happy to be here tonight in the presence of the lord how many recognize you're in the presence of the lord [Music] you say well i don't feel it but the word said but the word said where two or three are gathered together in my name that's your elect that's your bride that's the believer how many believers we have here tonight amen aren't you happy we can confess that amen or two or three are gathered together in my name there am i in the midst now just think of that in that talk about talk about reverence we can't we can't be reverent enough we can't we can't i how do you you know there would be enough [Music] reverence to be reverend enough i mean we can't produce it he just but he's not asking for that he's asking for our reverence and we say lord you're in our midst just think about that now you're in the midst of the king of kings wherever his bride is there is his presence did you know that yes that's where he is where his bride is is where he is because that's his house amen he dwells in his house aren't you glad that the veil has been rent yes yes the temple veil has been rent amen amen and the shekinah glory has come in view the mystery is revealed individually to members of his body what an honor what a glorious thing it is in this hour to be walking and fellowshipping and communing with the king and it's getting greater and greater and greater it's going to and it's going to climax in the meeting of him personally physically you believe that yes absolutely that could be any moment we could have a resurrection right here this evening amen we want to be expecting it amen that's that's our goal for being here we didn't come to church just to come we come here to meet him we come here together together we're sitting in the presence of god together we're seated in heavenly places in christ individually yes but together that's what god wants us to be unified where his presence what's the binding tie is very life that's the token that god must see that's the token he recognized the only thing he'll recognize is his own life amen and you believe his own life will do what produce his own works amen hallelujah if you'll stand with me it's good to be in the presence of the lord tonight and we're happy to be here and i'd like you to turn with me to luke chapter 18 the 18th verse to start with here three scriptures while you're standing i've got an extra five minutes here so that's okay i'll borrow it no i did appreciate that brother chris thank you the only problem is i didn't tell me who i didn't tell him who i was but you know what no matter who i am it's what he is amen that's what we want people to see it now i'm not making bow down any you say brother davis is a good excuse it probably was anyway luke 18 let's have a word of prayer first our heavenly father our father we are so thankful to come to you in the pre your presence in your name not just a statement but a reality not just a statement to say we come in your name but truly we're born in your name we come in your name and we are here to to glorify and manifest you in this hour in our decreed season that you brought us to be here we have one purpose lord one goal in this life and one focus and we should have our eyes single to that one focus and that's to bring glory and honor to he our husband our lord our king our life and lord jesus we are thankful that we could be here we knew it took faith for us to come here now we are here now father may you deal with each of us individually and personally we pray in thy name we pray and ask the blessing upon thy word in jesus christ's name amen amen luke 18 and a certain ruler asked him saying good master what shall i do to inherit eternal life now he knew there was a person he was standing for before he knew there was something he did not have and that was the eternal life they knew there was an eternal they knew there was a god that's eternal and he said what must i do to inherit he was looking for something he could do in the works of his own self to do to inherit eternal life and jesus said why call us thou me good none is good save one that is god thou knowest the commandments do not commit adultery do not kill do not steal do not bear false witness honor thy father and mother and he said all these have i kept from my youth up see he knew there's still something missing all that all that could do was put him in prison couldn't get him out but he knew there was a life lived in this man that could get him out now when jesus heard these things he said unto him yet lacquest thou one thing sell all that thou hast and distribute unto the poor and thou shall have treasure in heaven and come i want to put emphasis on this and come follow me and then i'd like you to turn with me to hebrews chapter 2 starting with verse 1. therefore we ought to give the more i want you to listen to this carefully every individual and i've had i've had a real burden with the young people for the young people tonight now it's ev to everybody but the lord laid this on my heart yesterday in prayer and and just seemed to focus it's speaking to you young people tonight i'm not differentiating age i'm saying young people and and it's to everyone not just young people but there's a focus and i want i believe the lord wanted me to say that he's going to focus on you tonight amen so listen to these words carefully this is the word of the lord the prophet said this is god in written form amen this is what your bible is it's god in written form therefore we we are are you a we yes amen therefore we ought to give the more earnest heed earnest the more earnest heed to the things which we have heard lest at any time we should let them slip for if the word spoken by angels was steadfast that's messengers for the word spoken by angels was steadfast in every transgression and disobedience received a just not unjust one but a just recompense of reward how shall we escape let me read that again how shall we escape if we neglect so great salvation which at the first began to be spoken by the lord and was confirmed unto us by them that vindicated the message by them that vindicated the word by them that heard him that received him they were living manifestations they were the voice of god to you there you are all right then i'd like you to go with me to matthew 16. matthew 16 the 24th to the 26th verse then said jesus unto his disciples if any man will come after me let him die to himself amen let him deny himself take up his cross cross means death there's something died take up his cross and follow me who is he the word the living word the word himself in the beginning was the word the word was with god the word was god and the word has become flesh and dwelt among us and now that same word is in flesh again today dwelling among us verse 25 for what's for whosoever will save his life shall lose it and whosoever will lose his life for my sake shall find it wonder what kind of life you'd find if you lost your life for his sake the same thing the rich young ruler was desiring eternal life amen amen all right now for what is a man profited if he shall gain the whole world and lose his own soul that's right that soul is who you are that's your beginning what that soul is is who you are tonight amen that's right for what a man what is a man profited if he shall gain the whole world and lose his soul or what shall a man give in exchange for his soul you see there's a there's a greater reality of someone in the inside of you it's either eternal or it's not right but it can be if you have the tug for god because you couldn't have that hunger and thirst for god except there was a deep to respond to it and there is his own life amen you may be seated i want you to turn with me to the song of solomon very short verse but i want to read it and that's chapter 2 and verse 1. there's a couple things here a couple stories that i'm going to read and then comment on those things and i want to go into something to climax this tonight so you pray for me if you haven't already pray for me if you have already thank you keep praying so so we just that's what we need isn't it how many believe prayer changes things there's power in prayer amen when you pray you're speaking to god you want to remember that it's not just a happen chance thing you're coming before him amen amen it's a serious thing this is some little thing that we do you know just but it's communing it's talking to if you want to be in his presence pray pray i can't express that enough pray jesus said watch and pray amen all right song of solomon chapter 2 verse 1 i am you know who the i am is i am the rose of sharon and the lily of the valleys i want to title this called the main thing the main thing i want to read a little story to you or before i do that i want you to turn with me to john i'll just bring this out before we do this and this is something that brother branham i'm reading this this is stories that brother branham gave so we're not it's not a story i have it's something i'm relating to that he said saint john 15 and verse 5 there's the i am again i am the vine you are the branches he that abideth abideth that's not in and out that lives there he dwells there all right i am the vine you are the branches he that abideth in me amen think of that abiding in him now how's the devil going to find you he can't get in there is that right so there's a place to abide there's an abiding place there's a perfect place there's a place of rest there's a place of satisfaction there's a place of life there's a place of resurrection there's a place eternal amen all right i am the vine you are the branches he that abideth in me and i in him sounds like oneness to me doesn't it it's what it is the same bringeth forth much fruit now he just got done saying i'm the vine he just well you just said it yes you are the branches but the same if you abide in me and i and he or he he and i and if he he that abideth in me and i in him the same bringeth forth much fruit for without me i want to make this real clear without me you can do nothing for without me you can do young people nothing amen that's that's all if you expect to go home if you expect to go in a rapture without him you can't make it you can have all the world you want you can have the best of finance you have the best of jobs but without him it's in vain it's totally fruitless you've been brought on this earth for one purpose you've said in front into a message heard the message hear it preach for one purpose that's that you might enjoy that same life eternally that you can give your life to him unreservedly that's what he wants amen you have only two powers there's only two powers that work today that's the power of satan and the power of god who is the word and satan is against it two powers you're serving one of those two tonight that's the truth tonight you say that's pretty direct i want to be very direct you're gonna serve one or two you're serving one or two of those tonight and that determines what's in your soul amen god's looking for his life to be on display and there's only one way that life can be on display is that he quickened the word in you himself amen amen our brother paul said sunday god planted that word in you before the foundational world it was planted it was planted for you to be here in this season to hear the message of this season the light of the season so that seed would manifest come to life amen amen that's him dwelling in you but it takes a submission it takes a surrender so brother david i've i've repented i pray that you have repentance isn't a little thing repentance is you're going one way you turn around go the other way repentance is a realize that what christ did for you calvary you couldn't do for yourself he gave you life purchased your life bought it and you've accepted it by faith believing that and you've asked him to come into your heart you've asked him to give you life you've asked to say lord i realize that you shed your blood for me i want that life you promise to give it to me i'm repenting of my past sins lord i want you to come in and live in me forgive me lord repentance genuine repentance you know sorry to say but there isn't too much genuine repentance anymore but then if you do that genuinely from your heart and accept it and show it outwardly that you believe that jesus christ died for you and when he died you died with him he took your sin right there in his body he judged he was judged for you and i he pardoned you and i and you've accepted that pardon then you rise up and take his name in baptism as outward expression of that inward faith that you believe in what he did and when you do that and you show yourself buried with him and raised with him the bible says and you shall receive the gift of the holy ghost is that right all right then don't stop at baptism go on the promises to you the promise is to you the devil doesn't want you to believe that and don't look for some emotional outset look for a revelation in your heart of truth that he that he and i'm not saying there won't be emotion i'm sure there probably will be because no man can be changed you can't be changed and not know it and something happened to you but it's going to be a reality look for reality he promised it he said he would give it to you let him fill you let him bring that peace let him bring that satisfaction that you can't bring of knowing him now you're born again now you've got a conversion now he has control and all he asks is follow me give yourself unreservedly bring yourself and die to yourself daily depend on me and take my word and follow me and i will take care of the rest of it it's not works is it brother david no work said he's not looking at outward works anymore it's no more the ways of the flesh is that right it's the way of the word it's the way of life it's so he comes in and quickens himself and comes and dwells in you and lives in you and you can't get enough of this message then you can't get enough of this word when that comes in when it came in me when i was just a young man 14. i couldn't get enough of this word from there on i still can't that hunger that desire that i have i i just got to feed on this message i got to feed on this word i've got to get alone with him i've got to pray what causes that it's a drawing from the inside drawing me what does he ask you to do heed that drawing if you feel that tug give way to that tug that's the thing he quickens he sent the holy spirit to quicken that to you and it will bring it up in and you'll grow as you draw through the word as you as you hear the word as you're hearing the truth it'll grow because he'll reveal himself from glory to glory from faith to faith right into a body change you can't have him dwelling in you and not know that and no by him in you it's identified that you'll be in the rapture i'm talking about him and you i'm not talking about just an anointing and feel good feeling i'm talking about the word living in you amen amen all right so i want to read a little story here and i want to comment here notice he is that rose of sharon that sweet smelling savor the anointing upon his people you cannot come before him with any creed or anything but anointed with that rose of sharon the word the word what himself in you he also he also not only the rose of sharon he's also the lily of the valley he's bridegroom and bride there's a rose of sharon he's the rose he's the lily what would the bride be she would have to be another rose and another lily by what power by what spirit by what life his own the anointing on his people on the word who are you you become the word when you're born again that new birth is the revelation is jesus christ revealed in you and it grows and it takes over the ground amen that seed has power in it when that seed's quickened it takes over the ground it brings your body subject to that spirit hallelujah isn't that romans 8 11 when the spirit when he when he the spirit of the spirit of christ when he comes in you will he not quicken your mortal body by that spirit that dwells in you amen all right so he was squeezed his life was squeezed out on calvary why was the squeezed out for you and i he's imparted his own life he's sharing his own life with you and i what's that resurrection got to do with us he imparted life to us hallelujah he had to bring forth his body he had to bring forth his bride and it came out of him hallelujah all right so he said he was squeezed out on calvary he was wounded for our transgressions do you believe that tonight he was wounded for our transgressions with his stripes we were he'll see he's already taken your transgression he's already taken your sicknesses he's already saved you you just have to accept it he's already healed you what do you have to do brother david what do i have to do accept it amen hallelujah hallelujah so he said he was wounded stripes by his stripes we were healed in that that squeezing out of the flowers he was a flower i want you to hold that because we're coming into a little story brother madam gabe bought a flower he was a flower he was the greatest flower that ever growed was the lily of the valley and this great rose of sharon how many believe in a watchman you have one called a pastor you have other ministry right here they're watchmen amen i'm not up here just stand up here give you what i think i don't have a right to give you what i think did you know that i don't have a right to tell you what i think i have my right is to tell you what he thinks what he said i have no seed to propagate that's right but i will sow his seed is that right amen all right so it's receiving the life whose life is that seed that he planted in you his own what does he do he comes to quicken his own life amen all right so he said he was squeezed out he's the greatest flower ever grow the lily isaiah you can turn with me if you want to this but let me just read this isaiah 21 11 and 12 the burden of douma duma means silence the burden of douma silent the burden of silence we're in a place right now where we don't know what that moment is going to be of our change we know we're in the day we know we're in the season but we don't know the moment is that right we don't know when that res it could be right here right here right here tonight tonight he's calling you you know he said no man can come to him except my father draws him and you know that the holy spirit through his word is drawing you tonight amen that's right how does he draw us he draws us through the word he draws us through his watchman he draws us and the watchman stands up and he gives you the time and he's preaching the season did you know the watchman preaches the season what time is it this is the time what time is it end time rapture time bride time seed time it's that's the rapture time that's the season that's what the ministry that's what the watchmen should be preaching amen the veil has been open the seals have been loosed let's seal the book and here's the people of that book yes what voice are you hearing see what are we what are we receiving it's the season it's the time he says this the burden of douma that burden it's a burden we don't want to be left here we've got to make it and what can i do with that burden cast it on him lord you know the burden i can't don't leave me here lord don't leave me here i can't make it on my mommy's salvation i can't make it on daddy's salvation don't leave me amen i've got to have my own experience you must be born again it's not a religion this message i did refute that fact this message is not a religion and it's not psychology god has his own psychology and it's the word but the man's psychology is a bunch of trash because it's what is it it's it's psychology is psyche the mind that's exactly where the devil wants you all the farther he wants you to go is your mental mind a feel good we want more than feeling good we want a true revelation something that's going to keep you that holds you that won't let you go that's himself in you revealed amen you know what i'm talking about there's three realms of a human there's that spirit mental realm but they're behind that there's a soul in that heart there's a place for the soul all right there is where you've got to meet him it's either the word or it won't be the word but the holy spirit was sent to quicken that word and without the quickening of that word there's no birth you can have as much anointing as you want but if that word's not there to receive that quickening power of the spirit poured out there's no birth but if you have a draw so i can't i can't i want him i've got to have him no matter what the future holds who i'm going to marry whom i'm not going to marry what kind of job am i going to have what i'm not going to have the first things first seek ye first the kingdom of god and his righteousness and all these other things will be added unto you put him first what would you have me do lord you show me what to do you show me what steps to take open the word to me reveal the word reveal the truth to me lord i hear people talk about revelation i need revelation lord reveal yourself to me amen he wants a personal communion and union with you whether the rest of them do or don't it's you it's you and god it isn't you and parents it's you and god it's not you and the rest of the the peers the rest of your friends it's you and god it isn't what they do it's what does god want you to do what does the word want you to do amen so he said the burden of douma i didn't finish that watchman what of the night watchman what of the night the watchman said the morning cometh and also the night good morning bride there's a morning coming amen but also the night gross darkness upon the people darkness on the earth but you're walking in light all right then he says but he said if you will inquire inquire means to seek out that inquire there means to search out if you inquire if you will inquire then inquire ye seek it out you know take my word for it search it out seek it out what would be what spirit would keep you away from reading and feeding on the word of god feeding on the message of the hour you tell me what spirit that is that would point you to something else that's temporal that will not give you life it's not god doing that when you have that pull in your heart for you i i want more of him he'll point you to where you'll find more of him he'll point you to his word he's not going to point you away from the message of the hour he's going to point you to the message because the message of the hour is jesus christ made flesh among us it's the fullness of the seed it's the fullness of life it's the complete revelation of himself that's their message of the hour that's easter to us amen and so so we see in choir if you want to acquire inquire we want you to inquire go search it out go dig it out for yourself come and and then it says return come other words come and that word return can be either come or go turn back turn around turn away turn back to god repent return god's asked you to return return back to life return back come to the fountain come to the only source of life there is the only way there is the only truth there is you say how do you know it's already vindicated it's already done vindicated this message has already done vindicated that it's god's voice amen well i don't know about that then you're not feeding enough to find out you're not inquiring amen you're not inquiring well i just come on sundays and my pastor yeah that's good your pastor's feeding you he's a watchman but are you taking what the pastor says and go and search it out and say lord reveal to me what the pastor said amen go back to the word lord i want more i want more today i want more tomorrow i want more the next day and the next day and you come sunday you're ready for more and the pastor will come and preach on what you've had already already what you've been feeding on and god will confirm it to you and god will reveal it to you because now you're in the channel with the right mental attitude toward the word that's a big statement right mental attitude i won't go there tonight it's the sermon in itself so we don't know we don't know just what time it'll take place what's he speaking of he's speaking about the resurrection the meeting with our loved ones a meeting catching you know we're going to be caught up together to meet the lord in the air do you know that where's the air is someplace between heaven between earth and glory in another dimension that's right you're going to meet him i'm going to meet him we're going to come and gather it up together we just don't know when that's going to take place we know we're in the season don't we how many believe that you know that we've already had it said you're at the end the seventh seal was the sign that the end has come how much longer the prophet said i don't know but keep keeping on keep steady keep your focus let your eye be single amen if it's not single say lord sharpen my focus on one thing that's you the person christ the word the presence of jesus christ living in me what are you trying to say i say focus on your strength not your weakness this is a weakness this is a weak thing and thank god it is because if it wasn't you'd be trying to do something that you can't do that right but when you focus on your strength your strength is the word revealed in you he said i'll take care of it all you die to yourself you take up your cross you realize you're a weakling and when you do you'll yield yourself to me and let me work through you my strength is made perfect in your weakness then paul said now glory in my weakness and when i'm weak i'm strong when i when i falter and want to make mistakes i have to go back and say repent it just shows i'm a weakling god says that don't bother me i'm not looking at what you did or didn't do i'm looking at my life in you isn't it somehow we can be happy and sad at the same time it's a paradox isn't it how we can be happy and sad at the same time because one side of us is eternal life and the other side is a bunch of clay that hasn't been born again has been changed yet has a nature in it two natures living in the same body but who's gonna prevail greater is he that is in you greater is he that's in the word that's already begun the work of his own life in you to live it and mature it and take it home and quicken your mortal body as you're here subject to the word and then quicken and change it brother sister if you're not living for the lord the lord's not living in you if you're not living for the lord you don't have nothing because it's all going to go away it's all passing it's like dust what do you have you have nothing because everything else is temporal there's only one form of eternal life and that's god himself the word himself living in you making you eternal with him making you that eternal life all right i'm not going to get done if i don't get done if i don't get started okay so we have so we don't know just what time it'll take place but it behooves us to be ready and listening to the warning voice listening to the warning voice yeah fearful sights see a roaring men's hearts failing for fear perplexity of times distress between the nations how many same men all right all these things were to take place and we got it and he said the church would be heady high-minded lovers of pleasure more than lovers of god look around you lovers of pleasure lovers of pleasure more than lovers of god listen that isn't the world out here they're talking about the church they claim to be believers they claim to have the holy ghost they claim what's these what what's happening here it's that carnal church we want your name but we don't want to we don't want your life we want your name and that spirit comes right down and say we want the message we don't want the life we want the message we just want a prophet to tell us what to do we're looking for him to come back and tell us what to do he's already told you what to do hallelujah yes he has he's already done told you thank god for the revelation of the word these are mysteries anointed one's the end time a mystery marriage and divorce a mystery serpent see the fullness of what the serpent seed was a mystery those seals open those mysteries hallelujah amen what for for a rapture for you to be raptured because you were part of the mystery you are the very essence of the whole mystery to be revealed because without you he's not perfect he's not complete that's more the way he's not complete he said i'm not complete without you amen is that right that's what i meant by perfect he's not complete he's got to have and he will have a complete family a masterpiece family amen all right so always said listen false accusers they're incontinent despises you know what continences no self-control despisers of those that are good scoffers listen to the holy spirit from the tower of glory tonight watchtower from the tower of glory amen listen to the voice from that tower the name of the lord is a mighty tower the righteous run into it and are yes amen said so oh listen to the holy spirit from the tower of glory tonight broadcasting by the radiant power of the resurrection to every believer's heart who believer's heart be ready for the hours at hand but all this mystery only i'll stop right there i'll stop right there brother branham on a message called come follow me preach in tucson preach to the graduation those were graduating he said kids you are each one seem like mine each one seemed like just like my sons and daughters and in one way you are see speaking spiritually spiritually speaking that's right the lord god has put your souls into my care because you come to listen to me you believe me and one says the word you are my sons and daughters that's right and always remember keeping the commandments of god is a great thing being raised in a good home is a heritage from god and to be fine kids with personalities you have good wonderful you have a you have an education it's wonderful even to live in this free land we've got many things to be thankful for but there's one thing you don't just you don't just don't inherit you've got to accept it that's eternal life and you only do that by following jesus by a born again experience don't neglect that neglect what's the word neglect mean it means to ignore overlook fail to do or perform by carelessness by oversight neglect also mains means to fail the heed or take note of it means to disregard to fail to get well i just come to church because my mother and father want me to i have to live in the home you know and i don't really care about the message i trust that isn't in your heart because if it is god can take it out it depends on what's in the soul amen what is your soul hungry for not what your physical mental human appetite hungry for what is your soul hungry for what is it yearning for way down deep what do you really want amen let the holy spirit influence you you're going to have someone or the other spirit or power influence you but let the holy spirit influence you you're going to go out in the world and you're going to be you're going to be lambasted with every influence there is influence of music influence of dress influence of others dressing influence of this influence of that every spirit you can imagine it's all coming down from one spirit amen that's right just in many faceted forms many members just like god has many members but all one word one god you see how satan doesn't have anything original you just remember that satan does not have anything original he's a perverter of the original he's a high breeder and high breed anything is death it's not an original form he can't reproduce so god wants you to know have the original amen you don't have to add your opinion to the original you don't have to add your thoughts and your reasoning to it you just accept and believe it because that original word is perfect it's flawless it doesn't need anything added to it or taken from it and in that form it'll do what it said amen that's right so anything the devil's god is an impersonation why would you want a bogus dollar the word bogus anybody know what word bogus means okay or a copy of anything when you can have the original why would you want a copy of religion when you can have the original why would you want a copy of christianity when you can have the original why do you want a copy of god's life when you can have the original the original is present why take a why take a copy why take why take a counterfeit when you can have the original the very original object himself himself well you could have the person himself living in you amen it's kind of ridiculous isn't it to think we'd turn down eternal life and accept death yeah wouldn't that be crazy wouldn't that just absolutely be insane and it is if you've got a tug for him why don't we let go of it i mean let it go let it let him have it amen amen don't try to don't try to cover it over with your reasoning well maybe another time maybe something the devil will tell you what are your friends going to think yeah that's right what's others going to think when you said i believe the message and all of a sudden you've come to the realization you really don't have what you thought you had but you need it and god's wanting to give it to you you know what the believers think of you praise the lord that's my brother that's my sister we'd say hallelujah thank the lord that's exactly what we want that's exactly the truth that's life why accept death when you can have life so let me tell you this story before time gets away from me so he comes down to a little story i heard one time from of a man oh he was poor he always wanted to he said it's a little fairy story like it always stuck with me though one day he picked up a flower and the flower was magical he told a magic story yeah you sure did but do you get the gist of what he's talking about it's a lot more than magic the flower was magic are you going to read between the lines all right the flower answered to him and said now here's the flower speaking hello here's the flower speaking we're going to call the flower the rose of sharon amen the lily of the valley he's speaking and he spoke to this man and he said you've been poor all your life he said now ask what you will and it'll be given to you sound familiar he said he said that yonder mountain would open up and that the boy said the man said the yonder that yonder mountain would open up and i could go there in wonderful i wonder if you find a white stone with a mystery that needed to be revealed opened you know it was in the pyramid mountain all right all right so he said that yonder mountain opened i could go there in and find the gold the gold the gold in the mountain all right then he said well he said you'll have to take me with you though yeah thank the lord i'll have to go with you you know you'll have to take me with you so wherever i am then you can ask what you will if you abide in me and my word in you ask what you will is that right and it shall be done unto you i'll never leave you i'll never forsake you i'll be with you even in you but you'll have to take me because where i am there will my servant be amen amen or where my servant is i abide in him i can't if she goes i go with her this isn't a boyfriend girlfriend affair this is a union we're talking about between the bride and the bridegroom it didn't come to full fruition like we're going to see today because now this is coming to a wedding supper in the original beginning it didn't i'm not talking about i'm talking about when christ was here that original pentecostal ride it had a marriage but it didn't come to full fruition why because god kept that mystery a secret until this hour that's the very thing that will literally turn the heart of the children back to that original faith that mystery that's what makes the bride so different what makes you so different what must i do to inherit what you have to do anything to inherit it it's freely given in fact we're here to impart it if you believe amen all right you think you have the pot do you have the authority to depart life you sure do to believers you have something to impart silver and gold have a numb but such as i have i impart it amen all right all right that's what god that's what we come to church for he's imparting you'll take me so wherever i am then you can ask what you will he walked to the mountain and the mountain opened up and he went in and the shelves were full of gold and diamonds why this message is wonderful look at all this gold and diamonds my i didn't know the message was so full of value valuable things i didn't realize all this was hit in this mountain and the mountain opened up and he went in and the shelves were full of gold remember how the prophet said it's just like being in a in a store he said well he said oh this has been purchased for me yes all this has been purchased for you well what do i have to do to get it just get up there and step up on the ladder of faith and just reach up and take it it's yours like being in a big arcade he said everything in there he said just why oh this is mine yes it's paid for it's yours you have need of it take it it's yours take it accept it believe it confess it confess what you believe and i'll make your body obey it is that right just just confess it i'll do it amen but you're gonna have to just hold that word right there and don't you deviate don't walk the left to the right don't let nothing come along and say well it's been too long don't you be mr impatient or mr skeptic amen how many know what i'm talking about how many young people know what i'm talking about message trial right say he preached a message called trial in fact he gave jesus christ a fair trial maybe you ought to go and hear it sometime hear it it's there it's available 1200 tapes are available for you 1200 of them besides one they didn't even minister tape and and probably tape but that's the ones we have on record and a volume the volume do you realize the book says the bible says i'm written here in the volume of this book i'm written here this is written of me if it was written of jesus christ which it is the full revelation i'm the completed revelation of himself it's written of me hallelujah it's written of me all right so he walked the mountain the mountain opened up the shelves were full of gold and diamonds and a little fairy and the little fairy story goes he laid the flower down like going off and leaving jesus in the mountain what happened when they got out there without him but you know what he always comes back on time he has mercy endureth forever amen so he said he a little he laid the flower down on a table on or a rock and he run and grabbed a great big gem and he said i must go show this to my friends nothing wrong with that go show it to your friends if you got something that's of value you like to share it look it here where'd you find that in a hidden place well i got to go there but you can't go there you've got to have this flower all right nothing like that flower you know there's nothing like it and he laid the flower down okay then he said i have everything now i must go this showed my friend now i'm a rich man i have everything i must show this and so the flowers spoke up and said you have forgot the main thing so he runs back and picks it up and says well maybe i'll get a piece of gold i'll i'll get a piece of silver and so he said i'll hurry out to tell the people how rich i am and all i've got and he got to the door and the flower said but you forgot the main thing he forgot the main thing so he runs back and he said in here he runs back and he said in here we find all kinds of materials so he picked up a stone he said i'll take this stone and show the people what kind of a stone in this mountain made of so i can find my way back to it see and he started out the door and the flower said for the final time you have forgot the main thing oh he said oh shut up he what did he do still the warning he forgot the main thing see he didn't want to hear it anymore forgot the main thing and he ran out the door and when he did the door closed behind him someday the door is closing yeah i trust it isn't already but if you have a desire for him i'd run as hard as you can into his presence because tomorrow may be too late i don't mean to scare you i mean to be truthful with you watch and pray amen we need to get serious about what we're believing here we need to get serious about this message it's not a play thing it's not a book of rules and regulations it's eternal life it's not a different another kind it's not william branham it's jesus christ it's not a son of man was revealing himself he was revealing himself the son of man revealing himself through a son of man who was it we saw on display okay where is he now somebody had to receive the message you've got to hear the voice when it comes to a time when you'll hear the voice the last time we don't know if we're going to get home tonight not a one of you know that you're getting home tonight by faith you believe you will maybe you won't you may not make it to the sea the next day many a person your age young people die every day thousands of them don't neglect the voice listen to it it's for your life it's between death and life how serious it is this is sober i know it should be sober and it's a sober moment but it needs to be amen there's not a one of us humanly speaking as of any good including me and your pastor our ministry they're not one good thing about me is a man there's only one good one and that's jesus christ amen i'm a total weakling so is every person in here i have to die daily brother sister don't neglect the voice god wants to give you life tonight amen you say well i've obeyed his word okay then obey this believe what he said and get serious with it and say god you promised me to fill me i want that more than i want to see life the next day i want that more than i want to see the sun rise i want that more than anything else amen i need that that means more to me than any games videos computers i don't care what it is don't you let none of that come between you that becomes idolatry anything that comes between you and god takes the place of your relationship with god is and i is an idol and god said i will have no other idols before me there's only one idol you serve and that's a living idol and that's jesus christ the same yesterday today and forever amen and that makes you his living idol i don't mean that we serve ourselves i'm not worshiping david i worship the christ in david in fact i pray to that christ in me did you know that did you know you prayed to the god in you that's absolutely right amen all right i'm not going to finish this i thought i'd get to more than this but let me just just give me about five minutes so the door shuts he didn't want to hear it anymore forgot the main thing he ran out the door and what he did the door closed behind him with the flower on the inside the main thing was the flower the main thing was the flower all this mystery is only is only all this mystery is revealed only to as he promised to his bride only hell is against this truth you know what they're doing hell's against the revelation of christ being here now that's what hell's against that's what it's fighting against that's been his enemy and the battle is between david and the enemy the battle between this lord jesus christ and me and the devil i've got it won hallelujah that's right that's it all right now he said all this mystery is revealed only to the as he promised to his bride hell is against this truth of the revelation of this mystery but the bride is standing on it that's her stand why do you hunger church why do you thirst it's the father trying to reveal this hidden secret to you young people he's trying to reveal it to you but you let who lets you let but you let so many things get it out of you you let your job that's right you let your wife you let your husband you let your children you let the cares of the world you let some pastor you let some somebody else get that out of you when you know that way down in your heart you're thirsting and you're hungry there's only one thing that's going to satisfy that thirst and don't you how dare you even try to satisfy it with anything of the world god put that thirst in you to thirst for one thing that was him amen amen so you're thirsting way down in your heart you're thirsty you're hungry god's trying to reveal it to you see but you're letting something else get it out of you when you know you're hungry and thirsty and they that hunger and thirst shall be filled so god is doing what wooing you to himself tonight saying come to me i'll fill you i'll draw i'm drawing you tonight come to me i'll fill you you're hungry you're hungry for god well bob i just don't know how to i don't know it's so simple you'll never figure it out all you need to do is accept what he said believe it he said i'll give it to you believe it go to him and say you said you'd give it to me god wants to be challenged on his word he wants you to come over here and say this is your promise i want something in me that'll change the way i act the way i present myself the way i i dress the way i look the appetite i have what i draw to how much what kind of music i listen to i want you to come in and and absolutely control every bit of it amen because i found out i can't stop it myself it's going to take a greater power than me to do it i want you to come in and live a holy life i want your life or i don't want to go any further when you get that serious god will get serious with you if you get that serious in your heart god will get serious with you i forget who it was brother brown said he said he was out in the cornfield he said if you don't fill me with the holy ghost you're going to file a pile you're going to find a pile of bones here and i'm not leaving until you do because why you promised and i'm hungry for it i want to be changed i want you to come in and live your life i want you to come in and control me i want you to come in and and manifest yourself i want you to live your life through me well you know devil tell you know you're going to be strange if you do that you know you're going to be called odd you know you're going to be called an oddball you know you're going to lose friends no but you'll gain some you'll belong to a family now the devil would like very much to belong to that family but he can't this is an exclusive family with exclusive rights and benefits that only is known and only can have those members can have and he said you come and buy freely you don't even cost you amen it don't even cost you you can come and buy freely amen how do i get it let go and let god have his wonderful way let go and let god amen he said what do i have to do get before him and get serious and you remind him of his promise he said lord i want it i've got to have it i don't care if i'm up all night i don't care then if i miss my job tomorrow i'm going to get serious with this until you feel me and when you do i know i'll know it i'm not looking for some emotion to prove it there's not an emotion living that'll prove it there's not enough shouts that'll prove it there's not enough anything will prove it i don't know what you'll do but there's one thing i do know it'll change you you'll know it because it's revealed to you all right now you he is the head of the church that in all things that's the body the church the body the bride he's the head he's the head of it first born from the dead that in all things he might have the prominence can i have one more story here before i leave and i'll i'll have to close i was going to get into mechanics and dynamics because that's the main thing too you can have all the words you want but without the dynamics it won't live that's right you can have all the you can have all the word you want without the dynamics won't live and you can have all the dynamics you want without the word and it still won't live so it takes dynamics and mechanics together you've got to have dynamics and mechanics together the dynamics have to come on the word no matter how much of a simonized job and how much of a paint job you've given it and how much of everything else you might dress even look alike and everything else you might shout and everything else without the word there for the holy spirit to quicken it doesn't it won't live you can't manifest the word but you can have all the word you want you can have the gasoline the powers in the gasoline but if there's no spark to spark the gasoline it won't live the word won't live will manifest we are here to manifest what the resurrection of jesus christ that's our purpose for being here so i'm just going to give you that's a quick synopsis you can go back to you go back to about paragraph 100 through about paragraph 113 of rising of the sun and find what i'm talking about and i'd say maybe you ought to do it find out what god's wanting until we become both dynamics and mechanics no good the spirit without the word no good and the word without the spirit no good amen it's got to have both and this bride will be both because he was both if you want to see a genuine manifestation of jesus christ in your life you've got to have both amen amen and it'll send you right down the road to the rapture that's it you want to see jesus christ the same yesterday and today and forever you've got to have both mechanics and dynamics amen now let me finish well we're letting you brother david okay let me finish let's turn to saint john 10. this is the last scripture i'll read here saint john 10. remember the lord said i am the way i am the truth and i am the life so without me you can do nothing i am the way i'm the truth and i'm the life that's saint john 14 6. but st john 10. watch what the watch what the thief is trying to do we're going to talk about a thief here in just a minute this last story i want to give you we're going to talk about the thief jesus said in the ninth verse i am the door by me if any man enter in he shall be saved and shall go in and out and find pasture you're going to have food amen verse 10 the thief cometh not now you know the lord isn't the thief he does come as a thief but he's not a thief so we're not talking about that we're talking about the thief himself so the thief cometh not but for to what steal and to kill and to destroy i am come that you might have life who's speaking who is the i am saying i will come i am come not i will i am i am come that you might have life and that you might have it more abundantly what an offer who could turn that down there's only one person that would turn that down the devil the rest of them are believers all right are you with me unbelief come from the devil sin came from the devil they don't believe this to begin with but you were in him to begin with and you believe it to begin with and you always did believe it to begin with so let go and let god have his way amen i'm speaking to believers here right all right but the thief cometh not but for to steal from you to kill you and to destroy you and oh he does it so suddenly and so beautifully and so reasonably he wants you to reason with the word it can't be because you can't have because because what nothing the bible didn't say you can have it because the bible said you can have it take it believe it accept it it's yours if he gives you a free gift i think brother paul said i gave what a 100 bill or something like that in the service one time come and get it or dollar bill maybe anyway what if i had a thousand dollars here and i was handing it to you oh i can't take it i can't take that what will people think if i take this thousand dollars you wouldn't care you could care less what people think now he gives you eternal life and why should you care what people think that's the truth why would you care what people think when you're offered eternal life can have eternal security and a security to your destination and a security internal security a security destination and your ownership and your life is loaned and lived by god himself creator of heavens and earth the author of life and the giver of every good gift now why are you going to turn that down or are you not going to turn it down he's offering it tonight he's offering it don't turn it down don't still we're gonna get i'm getting ahead of myself here okay ready are you ready for the story so we just read the thief cometh not foot for steal to kill destroy but i am come and he's here tonight and i'm come to give you life right here right now i'm not concerned about how you feel i'm not concerned about your e i'm not concerned about what you did or didn't do in the past i'm here to give you life right now invite him in invite him to come in accept him hey lord i'm sorry i made mistakes right here today forgive me for it you're forgiven cleanse me lord i don't want to do those things is that right yes then just receive me let him take care of it cleanse me lord he has right there he doesn't even remember it well the devil says you know what you did wait a minute who's talking to me yeah yeah that's good it's not god talking to you it's the devil bringing you in remembrance of what you did you're talking to the wrong side satan this one on the inside of me is perfect blameless sinless and because that's sinless in me i stand sinless before him because he can't see sin looking at me through his blood all he sees is himself don't have to commune with you i don't have to talk to you satan all right he said years ago as a kid as you all are here cattle ranch i as you all here are here cattle ranch above here above phoenix i was reading a piece of of a prospect a paper about a prospector then there was no roads through here then just a little sand paths they still do a lot of prospecting in here you know and i know there's gold mines up above if anybody's from really their arizona up above phoenix and wickenburg there's gold mines a vulture mine up there was a big gold mine at one time so there's prospectors there's been a lot of prospectors in arizona still a lot of prospectors here i pray you're prospecting tonight you say i've been prospecting you just keep searching seek and you shall find amen all right all right but the prospector he said no roads here just a little sand paths they still do a lot of prospecting here you know but the prospector had come in and he had found a lot of gold a lot of money and struck a lot of gold and on his road in he stayed in a cabin he had found and he had a dog with him faithful dog been with him for the years he's been out there searching and looking tied up on the outside and that and that night there had been an outlaw following him called the thief we just read about him he's after you if he could get you he wants your gold he can't have it but he don't want you to have it but it's not for him all right and so he had a dog faithful dog had him tied up on the outside he had this cabin and that night there had been an outlaw not knowing it he had an outlaw following him to get his gold he had packed it up in the old spanish he had picked it up in the old spanish mines and he was coming in with it and the dog started barking so here's the prospector inside he lays his bag upon the table he said you know they didn't say that brother david but i read another story refers to it he laid his bag upon the table starts counting it out and my i'm just going to be i'm really wealthy boy and just right in the morning i'm going to take this now he started dreaming about how what he'd buy and what he'd do and he's unwealthy and that night outlaw was following him he picked it up he excuse me and the man didn't want to be bothered with the dog but as he started to lay down dreaming about what he'd do the dog started barking and the man didn't want to be bothered with that dog i hear that minister all the time all he does is yell at me i'm getting tired of his barking i wish you wouldn't bark so but if i didn't bark you wouldn't be warned or if my brother didn't bark not just me i'm talking about the ministry it's not easy to bark when you know you might get shot that's right you don't want to hear the bark many people don't want to hear the bark you know he told that enough about how i dress and what i do and what i don't do god's not pleased with it so why shouldn't i tell you the truth why keep it from me if god's not pleased with it let me tell you he's not pleased if he's not pleased don't neglect the voice all right and so he comes there he says said tomorrow i'll take this to the city and so and i'll have it wait up and i'll be a rich man i'll buy great cars i'll have all kinds of women and big parties and i'll be a rich man because i've already struck a threat to claim i've got the gold here much of it and while he was trying to go to sleep the dog kept barking because the dog seen the outlaw coming up slipping up waiting for the prospector to go to sleep he raised up again screamed the dog shut up the poor old dog whined and you know felt bad about it and tried to warn you know the preacher goes home and just goes on one ear and out the other one ear and out the other what do i do lord pretty soon he starts to get a complex and said lord forgive me i can't get a complex over him i've got to hold steady truth true truth that it is well i'll just quit no you can't quit god called you to preach god cause you tell the truth even if they crucify you but uh lord i'll stand at that day i've told them the truth is this you up here that said that that evening was that you that's me lord did you hear that what are you gonna do standing in the presence of that light you can't lie yeah that was me why he's gonna ask you why didn't you heed it why'd you neglect it when you could have had more of me you only went

your life you'll commune i'll take you home i'll take care of you who's going to take care of you like he will all shut up he said and he said the dog whined and tried to warn his master that danger was lurking lurking and when he the next time when the dog started barking the prospector had a shotgun he didn't want to be bothered he just raised up and shot the dog and the prospector was killed that night by the outlaw all of his fancy dreams come to him no good why he's still the voice that was warning him oh what will he do he killed the voice that was warning him let that not be our stand let the voice of the holy spirit that warns the church day after day as we see the approaching of the lord let's not still that voice by ignoring it that's what the meaning of neglect is ignorance ignoring it and turn it away but let's take heed to the warning that he gives us god has watchmen over his heritage there's nobody can try to do anything you kids could would never be able to do anything wrong after being raised the way you are unless you would feel something tell you not to do it now don't never still that voice that's warning you always remember accept that voice that said follow me accept that voice that said follow me and you'll always come out right amen i believe you will i got confidence in you but always remember that jesus that voice is alive in the earth tonight there's a predestinated seed i believe right here tonight in these young people that want to receive this voice i don't believe god does anything just to be doing it right god knows your heart you can't hide from him if you tried he knows exactly what's ahead of you he knows what's behind you he knows where you're standing you can't hide from him amen i want that's the god i serve how about you you see it's real to me but the question is is it real to you that's what we want isn't it we want the real we don't want the halfway we want the real we want reality but there's only one reality amen amen do you love him let's stand together i won't go any further i'm right at that junction point now so i was going to go into something else but we'll just stop have to pick it up another time don't steal the voice don't leave tonight without the main thing right where you are you can be changed you can accept it right here tonight let's bow our heads i'm going to ask you a question do you want more of him or don't you every head bowed i want your eyes closed just every head well do you want more of him if you do you want him to come and live in you raise your hand high so he can see it not just a halfway hearted raise of hand let's raise it up you really want him then accept it [Music] it isn't just for brother david it isn't just for ministers it isn't just for old people this message listen brother sister this become real to me at 12 years old this is not a play thing god kept me through those teen hard teen years he wouldn't leave me but he changed me i'm not special as any of you he can change you when he called me i answered why because he put that in me to answer [Music] could i do that on my own no but he put that in me to do it now what means more to you what the devil's telling you through reasoning saying oh don't do that don't do that you got all kinds of time no you don't you don't even know how much time [Music] i'm gonna ask you to get alone with god tonight if you're serious if you're serious and you really want him i'm asking you before you go to sleep tonight you take that time with him you stay there and i challenge him to take him at his word if you're serious with god god will get serious with you but you're gonna have to ask him you're gonna have to go to repenting and being baptized is not a ritual it's not something we just do it's a genuine sovereign sincere thing now you've done that now go on with him some have some haven't done that [Music] but it's open for you that's the command that's the obedience that he wants you to obey there's only three physical things that god asks you to obey physically physical ordinances that was water baptism by repentance after repentance it's not the water that saves you brother sister it's the faith in the blood that saves you and then the life of that blood can be imparted to you because then the power of the blood sanctifies sets a person clean he can come and live in the other two is foot washing and lord's supper but how you gonna take that until you are in communion with him because when you're in communion with him then you can show the rest of them you are in communion if you don't take it it shows you have no part with it so it becomes a showdown you take it unworthily see if you take it don't take it i should say then you're showing you have no part with him [Music] but if you take it unworthily you bring damnation upon your own self so be right there's no reason to be halfway let's go all the way amen let's sing that song i'm going to leave it in your hands no special rituals [Music] you've been told how to get it how to come to it you need you need to make your decision dragging you nobody's forcing you nobody's pounding on your back you either come by the way of the word or you don't come the right way amen it's the way of truth and if he's called you and he's pulling on you then you better thank the lord because whom he called he can justify and we justifies and glorify amen so why don't you heed it don't go another day without it don't go another night without it you don't have to leave here we'll pray with you you want prayer we'll pray with you amen it's up to you amen what are you playing let go and let god have his [Music] wonderful way let go and let god [Music] your night [Music] brother sister he's given you light to walk in now i say let's walk in the light amen the light's here the lights keep giving light to walk in why walk in darkness anymore walk in the light the lights come across your pathway now you're now you're you are responsible for what you do with that light [Music] amen now you're responsible for what you do amen amen let's sing a song here i know it's i've run over time but you forgive me i know you'll forgive me for it but i believe that was needed i believe the lord wanted that said [Music] amen let's i have a couple of songs here he abides he abides he believe he wants to abide amen i'm rejoicing

think brother david you're judging me tonight no i'm just preaching what god laid in my heart god knows your heart nobody's saying you have or you have amen but god knows your heart so it's been spoken let god take care of he'll take care of the rest of it amen [Music] amen you're the one that has to know [Music] but don't reason with the devil about it because if you don't you either do or you don't amen that's right and if you're not sure say lord show it to me i thought i was one time ever have those questions and lord i'm getting serious with this i believe i do show me make it known to me i've gotten a little cold make it known to me heat me up [Music] i've gotten away from the word i'm not feeding like i should forgive me lord i've let other things come in magazines other things to do when you pointed me to the word to read it to pray satan points me to something else forgive me lord [Music] let me get get me on the right path but don't think because just because you had a chill you had a feeling i clapped my hands i did some kind of work god's going to receive it you only receive one thing that's his own life in you then if you're sure ask god lord show me show me do i
