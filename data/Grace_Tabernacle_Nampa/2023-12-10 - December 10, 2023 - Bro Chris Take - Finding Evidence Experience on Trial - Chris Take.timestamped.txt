[26:40] Alex
[26:42] man you know we
[26:46] have been given an an incredible
[26:49] opportunity to sit here today amen and I
[26:53] don't say that cuz I'm the one
[26:56] Speaking he God
[27:00] I mean look at Adam and Eve they didn't
[27:02] they were cast out in the
[27:04] garden Generations upon Generations from
[27:09] them they didn't
[27:11] have
[27:13] this they had a
[27:15] promise of this amen not the building
[27:18] not the instruments and the singing and
[27:22] the preaching but the access full access
[27:27] to
[27:30] Christen every service that we come to
[27:33] here we should be on the edge of our
[27:35] seats amen what what is God going to say
[27:39] today if we can't have that confidence
[27:42] in our ministry we should pray about
[27:44] somewhere else to go that's right am but
[27:46] I believe that we're here this morning
[27:47] because we have that confidence in the
[27:49] ministry that God has called for Grace
[27:51] Tabernacle God what are you going to say
[27:54] today we're not fulfilling an obligation
[27:57] that's right
[27:59] we are acting upon a promis amen so I
[28:02] hope this morning we can we can we can
[28:04] put our thoughts and our hearts and our
[28:06] minds right on the right out there so
[28:10] that God can take them and speak to our
[28:14] hearts amen I'm going to invite you this
[28:18] morning
[28:19] to uh the
[28:21] courtroom we have some evidence we need
[28:24] to examine and we're going to put
[28:28] to
[28:29] trial the evidence of the Holy
[28:32] Spirit you can start it make sure this
[28:35] works my title this morning is finding
[28:38] evidence the subtitle of experience on
[28:42] trial we make sure this clicker
[28:46] working I think the batteries are dead
[28:49] again oh I can touch the screen you're
[28:51] right thank
[28:54] you well if somebody gets a chance to
[28:56] get new batteries and make this work
[28:58] that's it is easier then I have to don't
[28:59] come back to the pulpit so this morning
[29:01] I want to talk about finding evidence
[29:03] and I I want to I want to continue on to
[29:06] what we talked about last time I
[29:08] ministered which was on emotions
[29:11] position so this isn't technically part
[29:14] two it's a it's an extension because I
[29:16] found myself being too confined if I
[29:19] stuck with that title or that subject so
[29:23] I wanted to step on and and there's some
[29:25] things that come into play when you
[29:27] thank you sir when you deal
[29:30] with experience when you deal with with
[29:33] with something someone saying I got the
[29:36] holy ghost or or someone saying they got
[29:38] the Holy Ghost and this this goes in
[29:40] line with emotions because we're human
[29:42] beings and and and we and we only have
[29:45] five
[29:45] senses we have six actually the Sixth
[29:49] Sense is Faith yes science has proven
[29:51] that we have that as well so we have the
[29:53] ability to access the spiritual world
[29:55] don't worry we'll we'll stand and read
[29:56] the scripture in a minute here but so
[30:00] when it comes to that element of emotion
[30:03] there's something that that we that we
[30:05] we we apply that those terms or or the
[30:09] evidence of that emotion to if we're not
[30:11] careful we we we put that to an
[30:14] experience somebody had an experience
[30:15] someone is having an experience and so
[30:18] today I want to I want to look at that I
[30:19] want to look at
[30:22] um a couple of things what role does an
[30:25] experience play in the New
[30:28] Birth what role does emotion play in an
[30:31] experience and how do we know we know
[30:34] Christ now at the end of the day we
[30:36] could we could all say the same thing we
[30:38] could all say well we know Christ
[30:39] because Christ is in me and and and and
[30:43] uh an experience is receiving Christ and
[30:45] being and the new birth and the all of
[30:47] that is is is being able to say Amen to
[30:50] your word and those are those are the
[30:52] right answers but I want to by God's
[30:54] help Deep dive into what what this looks
[30:58] like there there are surface level
[31:00] answers that I'm sorry they are fine to
[31:03] communicate a subject but they are not
[31:06] enough to teach they're not enough to to
[31:10] to to just say those lines and move on
[31:12] no that you got to go into the word of
[31:14] God and say what does God say because if
[31:16] you're not careful you just take one
[31:17] little thing out you say well this is
[31:18] what God thinks about the topic but God
[31:20] has given us an entire book 66 books
[31:24] 1100 sermons there's a lot to God and
[31:26] we're going to Experiencing God and and
[31:29] understanding God for
[31:31] eternity so we have to be careful not to
[31:33] just gloss gloss over these things that
[31:37] God has given us so real quick couple
[31:42] quotes I thought I only had okay this is
[31:45] a longer quote we'll jump to the
[31:47] scripture can you guys jump to the
[31:48] scripture real quick then we'll come
[31:49] back to this quote here so Jeremiah
[31:52] chapter 2 I believe it
[31:56] is
[31:58] I don't want to spend too much time
[32:00] before we read the
[32:01] scriptures there we go Jeremiah chapter
[32:05] 2 verse
[32:09] 11 okay awesome Jeremiah 2 vers1 please
[32:14] stand with me in honor of God's
[32:19] word since we're in court this morning I
[32:22] could say all rise for the honorable
[32:23] Judge Jesus Christ
[32:26] amen
[32:28] hopefully you brought him with you
[32:30] amen Jeremiah chapter
[32:33] 2 verse
[32:37] 11 and this this thought started to come
[32:39] forth in many different stages be when I
[32:41] was listening to the sermon broken
[32:43] sisters so this is where the scripture
[32:45] comes from Jeremiah
[32:48] 2:1 hath a nation changed their gods
[32:51] which are yet no Gods but my people have
[32:54] changed their glory for that which does
[32:56] not profit be astonished oh you ye
[32:59] Heavens at this and be horribly afraid
[33:02] be you very desolate saith the Lord for
[33:05] my people have committed two
[33:07] evils they have forsaken me the Fountain
[33:11] of Living
[33:12] Waters and hewed them out sists broken
[33:17] sists that can hold no water let's bow
[33:21] our heads Heavenly Father Lord
[33:23] Jesus Lord we we we we've studied we we
[33:26] put time and and Lord I I I pray that we
[33:29] we've got slides and PowerPoint and if
[33:32] we're not careful it just becomes an
[33:33] intellectual lecture I pray this morning
[33:35] that wouldn't happen that you would keep
[33:37] your spirit would have freedom to
[33:39] minister to us this morning Lord this is
[33:41] not just psychology Lord this something
[33:43] there's an element to this this is the
[33:45] living breathing word of God and Lord we
[33:48] have the desire God for you to to grow
[33:51] our hearts to grow our minds to to to
[33:53] catch a revelation of your word that
[33:55] that we could receive it that it could
[33:56] Dro down into our hearts that it could
[33:58] change us what point is there today to
[34:02] come here and leave no different God
[34:04] help us Lord Jesus to attain your word
[34:06] this morning may you speak to us may you
[34:08] push aside the the the the the our
[34:10] thoughts our opinions Lord even those
[34:13] sitting here this morning who have
[34:15] opinions may they lay those aside this
[34:17] morning that you could speak to our
[34:18] hearts I ask father and rightly divide
[34:21] the word of God in Jesus Christ's name
[34:23] we pray amen you may be seated this
[34:25] morning
[34:31] so let's jump back to this quote
[34:36] so not only did in Jeremiah we just read
[34:39] not only did they create
[34:42] sisters they were broken sisters that's
[34:44] right so if you if you listen to the
[34:46] tape broken sisters you understand what
[34:48] a sistern is but just for the sake of
[34:49] context this morning a sistern is a
[34:51] man-made well that collects water from
[34:53] the rain amen so it only has water when
[34:56] it rains so someone if someone only has
[34:59] an experience when it rains but they
[35:02] don't have a something that that gives
[35:04] them the ability to live a life after
[35:05] that it's simply a sstn that's
[35:07] collecting water now when the W when
[35:10] when it rains the rain soaks into the
[35:13] ground and that and that'll go in
[35:15] that'll come into the ground and that's
[35:17] how that's where water comes from as
[35:19] well but so it's the same effect the
[35:21] rain's falling but there's something
[35:22] about the living Fountain G the Bible
[35:25] says fountain so there's something
[35:27] coming from the inside the the the it's
[35:31] not a sistern it's a well right there's
[35:33] always water coming okay and it and it
[35:36] it it doesn't stop amen if if it's dry
[35:39] you're not dry that's right am so in
[35:43] this in this quote here personal
[35:44] experience with god brother bam says he
[35:46] says you notice of a morning when the
[35:47] Dew I've watched it many times when I
[35:49] see the de fall at night time look out
[35:52] there see the d fall and every time when
[35:54] the sun comes up did you ever notice how
[35:56] happy a little do drop was for us the
[35:59] last past few days it's been Frost in
[36:01] the morning he just Sparkles and shines
[36:03] and sparkles and shines I was asking one
[36:06] one morning talking to nature which was
[36:08] my first Bible I said what makes you
[36:10] Sparkle little do
[36:12] drop and it seemed thank you for getting
[36:15] this working and it seemed like that
[36:18] something in a way spoke back to me said
[36:20] you know last night I was up there I
[36:23] know I'm going up again for I belong up
[36:25] there so the moisture came from the
[36:28] atmosphere and and fell upon the ground
[36:31] and and the d drop is speaking back say
[36:34] I I woke up this morning and I realized
[36:36] I belonged up there I'm going up there
[36:39] again Way Beyond this old hot Earth up
[36:41] there where the moisture stays and I was
[36:43] once up there and I'm happy because the
[36:46] Sun's shining on me and when the Sun
[36:49] Shines on me it'll draw me right up to
[36:51] where I
[36:53] was so he's going back to where he came
[36:56] from and something excites him what is
[36:59] it that it excites him remember we're
[37:01] talking about emotion and and I really
[37:04] pray the Lord help me not go off to this
[37:06] tangent where I'm going to try to
[37:08] support an opinion I just I just want to
[37:11] talk about preach on the word of God and
[37:13] and help bring light to ourselves how we
[37:16] balance Our Lives how we balance our
[37:18] ourselves in the in the church and in
[37:20] everything that we do and so he what
[37:23] excited him and maybe there's some you
[37:26] know in confusion around this subject
[37:29] whatever reason God's going to
[37:31] minister and because I have faith in him
[37:34] so he Sparkles not because of of the
[37:37] earth not because of the grass that he's
[37:40] on or wow he's on the president's lawn
[37:43] the DW drop does not care whose lawn
[37:45] he's on whether that lawn has been mowed
[37:48] or it's overgrown whether he's on the
[37:50] the the tip of a of a leaf of a Sage
[37:53] Brush whether he's on the the the the
[37:55] the the very top to of the the of the of
[37:59] the California Redwoods he does not care
[38:02] what excites him is the sun is shining
[38:05] on him and he knows that the effect of
[38:09] the Sun is going to draw him back up
[38:12] that's right okay that's what makes him
[38:14] Sparkle that's right that's what makes
[38:16] him excited okay he says and I think
[38:19] that's right the reason you can do that
[38:21] and Sparkle because you've got an
[38:23] experience amen so remember experience
[38:26] on trial this
[38:32] morning
[38:35] experience I'm not going to go there so
[38:37] you because you've got an experience you
[38:39] was up there once amen that's
[38:44] right the energy and the inspiration
[38:47] that comes from that
[38:51] Revelation that Revelation cannot be
[38:54] impersonated that's right the energy the
[38:56] sparkle can be but that Revelation
[38:59] cannot be and and we're going to bring
[39:02] those to case this morning and I think
[39:04] about that that a man's ever been born
[39:06] again and took out of this life into
[39:08] another realm of blessings and glories
[39:10] one of these days the son of
[39:12] righteousness will shine across the
[39:13] Earth and those with them kind of an
[39:15] experience what is the experience he's
[39:18] talking
[39:19] about I we're going to get to to bring
[39:21] this out more but I want to get your
[39:23] minds in the right direction what
[39:24] experience is he talking about he's
[39:26] talking about experiencing the
[39:28] realization the Revelation that you
[39:30] belong to Christ amen that is the
[39:34] experience that he's talking about we'll
[39:37] be caught up to meet him in the air so
[39:38] when you're in the service and and God
[39:40] begins to speak to your heart or you're
[39:42] at home listening to a tape or or or a
[39:46] sermon I'm trying to stop saying tape
[39:47] because they're not tapes anymore at
[39:49] home listening to a sermon of the
[39:50] Prophet or reading your scriptures or
[39:52] reading a devotion or or walking through
[39:54] the through the woods when some
[39:56] something strikes your heart and you
[39:58] brought to Remembrance in a moment that
[40:00] you're not from this Earth You don't
[40:03] belong here that that chaos that you see
[40:05] around you you don't belong in it you
[40:08] don't belong to it you're not involved
[40:10] you do not care
[40:12] amen right that is what made brother
[40:16] brown run around the tree that's that is
[40:19] what makes a real Son of God son or
[40:21] daughter of God Express themselves
[40:24] that's right however some people putting
[40:27] their hand up I mean you just reached a
[40:29] pinnacle of their expression but there's
[40:31] something happening inside of them and
[40:34] when that's the case because it's not a
[40:36] sstn it's a living water when that's the
[40:39] case and they walk out into the dry
[40:41] desert that the world is they're an they
[40:45] are an oasis of life amen what life
[40:50] that's it the Life of Christ that's
[40:52] right amen up there where they have been
[40:54] in the Realms of G glory and love lost
[40:56] themselves lost themselves you know one
[40:59] of the one of the Prime examples of
[41:01] brother brandom and and he's judging
[41:03] those women who are who are playing the
[41:05] the the washboard and playing the piano
[41:07] and they start to dancing in his church
[41:08] you remember that story when he's a
[41:09] young pastor and he starts to judge them
[41:11] then he starts to think wait a minute
[41:13] you know David danced and all these
[41:14] examples he puts it this way I came to
[41:17] myself dancing that's right something
[41:21] took him over he didn't go out there and
[41:23] say well I'm going to start dancing
[41:24] that's right nothing in the music queued
[41:27] his response it was something inside of
[41:30] him could not contain anymore that's
[41:33] right and that is a real experience and
[41:36] all that's around them they don't care
[41:38] who's around them they once been up and
[41:40] when they get into them kind of
[41:42] conditions with an with anointing of the
[41:45] spirit that Master Spirit Jesus Christ
[41:47] will come someday to claim his church
[41:51] Hallelujah okay so we read this
[41:53] scripture already but there's two evils
[41:56] that his people God's people are we
[41:57] God's
[41:58] people there's two evils that we find
[42:01] ourselves in it's always two right twins
[42:05] it's always two false True Vine
[42:08] amen okay fear Faith it's always two
[42:12] they have forsaken me the Fountain of
[42:15] Living Waters so he's bringing us into
[42:18] context of the example okay the example
[42:22] is comparison of The Well of Living
[42:24] Waters a fountain a spring and a sistern
[42:27] what's the
[42:28] difference one is manmade right okay so
[42:32] he's not just saying You' forsaken me
[42:34] then you've hewed Out Sisters no he's
[42:35] saying who he's identifying who he is
[42:39] and before God ever makes a
[42:41] comparison before God ever makes a
[42:43] comparison before we can make a
[42:45] comparison we have to identify both
[42:47] sides of the
[42:48] equation you cannot compare on something
[42:51] you don't know that's
[42:53] right you cannot compare on on something
[42:57] you don't understand boy that's a
[42:59] problem in the world today that's right
[43:00] people are
[43:03] comparing so two evils forsaken the
[43:05] fountain Living Waters sisters the
[43:08] interesting thing is when a sister is
[43:09] full of
[43:11] water
[43:13] visibly visibly there's no difference
[43:16] there's water in
[43:18] both for the context this morning all
[43:20] water comes from God okay all water
[43:23] comes from
[43:24] God proverbs 5:2 it is the glory of God
[43:28] to conceal a thing with the honor of
[43:30] Kings is to search out A
[43:34] matter okay so why are
[43:38] we if the holy spirit is a magic pill
[43:41] why do we need the scripture that's
[43:43] right it's not a magic pill you know the
[43:46] Holy Ghost is the bottom of the pyramid
[43:48] there's been some gone back and forth
[43:50] the holy spirit's up there at the top no
[43:52] the holy spirit's at the bottom of the
[43:53] pyramid take that through the message
[43:55] through through the scriptures you will
[43:57] find that emphatically
[43:59] proved because from there what is Faith
[44:02] the holy spirit is a recognition of the
[44:04] faith that you have circumcision of the
[44:07] heart
[44:08] amen Abraham did not get the promised
[44:10] son till he was circumcised then he
[44:13] walked unto adoption amen he built his
[44:17] way through the statute of a perfect man
[44:19] many many examples to scripture so when
[44:21] you get the Holy Ghost it's not a magic
[44:23] potion you're suddenly going to have
[44:24] perfect marriages you're suddenly not
[44:26] going to have any problems that's right
[44:28] you have just begun amen that's God has
[44:33] concealed a thing amen God has concealed
[44:37] his word in Simplicity amen it is now up
[44:42] to
[44:44] you to search out the matter amen how
[44:49] how where do you even start the Holy
[44:50] Ghost is the inward teacher he leads you
[44:53] he guides you he he's he's if I could
[44:55] have the Liberty to make this example
[44:57] he's a librarian and you go to the
[44:58] librarian and this is at least how it
[45:00] used to be so I've heard in the old days
[45:03] and say hey this is the subject I'm
[45:05] studying and they can say okay I can
[45:07] recommend this book this book this book
[45:09] this book this book but it's your job to
[45:11] read it amen God has recommend
[45:14] recommends every Sunday every Wednesday
[45:17] a book to go read
[45:19] amen that's right it's up to us to
[45:22] search out the matter amen there's
[45:24] something in your life and we all know
[45:26] it's in the back of our head saying well
[45:27] if I just read more if I just prayed
[45:30] more now we take that quote where
[45:31] brother say you can talk too much you
[45:33] can read too much but you can't pray too
[45:35] much and then we don't do any
[45:37] reading balance
[45:40] balance so God
[45:43] conceals right look at what did the if
[45:45] it was good enough to just hear God
[45:47] speak and move on why did the disciples
[45:49] come to him and say Jesus can you
[45:50] explain to us that Parable that's right
[45:53] they were searching out the matter they
[45:57] care you can tell in the meeting a lot
[45:59] of time not every time but a lot of
[46:00] times in a business meeting you can tell
[46:02] when people are paying attention if they
[46:03] ask you
[46:05] questions that's right if there's no
[46:08] questions it's either a very obvious
[46:10] topic or nobody listened okay John
[46:15] 7:43 so there was a division among the
[46:18] people because of
[46:21] him you
[46:23] see I struggled to figure out how this
[46:26] fit to be honest with you but God May me
[46:27] leave it in
[46:29] there because if you're not if if if
[46:32] we're not careful Lord help me make this
[46:35] point we're called to search out the
[46:37] matter right yes okay if we're not
[46:42] careful we we we fall into this this
[46:45] example here so this is where this
[46:47] scripture comes from it comes from this
[46:49] just before
[46:50] this so there was division among the
[46:53] people because of him so Jesus just got
[46:54] done ministering
[46:56] and and and and John 7:50 to 53
[46:59] Nicodemus saith unto them he that came
[47:01] to Jesus by Night being one of them he
[47:03] says do our law so the Pharisees
[47:05] Sadducees right there's division in the
[47:07] religious leaders says doesn't our own
[47:09] law judge a do our law judge any man
[47:13] before it hear him and know what he
[47:16] doeth so Nicodemus has already had a
[47:19] personal conversation a personal
[47:22] interview with Jesus he was seeking out
[47:24] he wanted to go so often today this is a
[47:27] good P good lesson for your personal
[47:29] life don't
[47:31] assume go talk to the person go talk go
[47:34] talk to them so the same thing in the
[47:35] word of God if we hear
[47:38] something
[47:40] said and and and and we were quick to
[47:42] say well I've never heard that before
[47:44] and I've been in the church for 40 years
[47:47] I've been in the church for 20 years my
[47:48] parents been in the church whatever
[47:50] however long whatever whatever excuse
[47:52] you're going to use to then not go
[47:53] search out A matter you fall right into
[47:56] this error which is they answered and
[47:58] sent unto him art thou also of Galilee
[48:00] search and look for out of Galilee
[48:01] ariseth no Prophet that is true that's
[48:05] right but they missed amen it because
[48:08] they didn't even bother checking
[48:12] right and every man went unto his own
[48:15] house division came in there was a
[48:18] separation there because they didn't
[48:21] search out the matter amen God concealed
[48:25] himself
[48:26] in a illegitimate birth that's right and
[48:29] a
[48:30] census
[48:32] right there was a some Shepherds and a
[48:34] few wise men who quickly vanished after
[48:38] the
[48:42] experience too often I find in message
[48:47] culture when someone steps outside the
[48:49] message Norms not the word message Norms
[48:54] we excuse it immediately and we are just
[48:57] like the religious leaders of those days
[48:59] sir who who the Pharisees and Sadducees
[49:02] who are they today the church that's
[49:05] right am we are not immune to this
[49:11] problem finding evidence go ahead take
[49:14] it go to the word of God ask God to show
[49:17] you listen pray pray God preach to the
[49:20] preacher that's right amen that's
[49:24] right
[49:27] I wonder how many times we struggle to
[49:28] find the will of God for a sermon
[49:30] because you're not praying that's right
[49:32] yes sir that's right or I'm not praying
[49:35] so
[49:36] experience I think it's important to
[49:38] Define you know it's it's hilarious we
[49:40] all speak English and English is a
[49:41] complicated language and we all assume
[49:44] definitions of words
[49:45] constantly you hear them used and you're
[49:47] like no that's not what that word
[49:50] means dictionary is one of my best
[49:52] friends I I have to constantly look
[49:54] words up with the material that I that I
[49:57] listen to and at work people write
[50:00] documents sorry didn't understand a clue
[50:02] you just said let me get my dictionary
[50:04] so experience by definition is the
[50:06] apprehension of an object through or
[50:09] emotion through the senses or mind so
[50:13] what happens is is it's just like when
[50:15] you're training a a dog and he does
[50:18] something good you give him a little
[50:19] treat then he knows hey that thing gets
[50:23] me this treat so as we when when when
[50:27] something happens somebody there's an
[50:28] anointing happens on falls on somebody
[50:30] there's an they they have a um uh this
[50:34] manifestations we say they had an
[50:37] experience and our brains because our
[50:40] brains psychologically like to simplify
[50:44] everything if it's too complicated our
[50:47] brains get um what's called sensory
[50:50] overload so we like to simplify things
[50:51] that's why computers are in a nice
[50:53] plastic shell because if we could see
[50:55] all the components working it would be
[50:57] overload for our brains sheetrock on
[51:00] walls right okay so cars and the the
[51:03] covering of the cars you open the hood
[51:05] you're like especially nowadays like wow
[51:06] shut the Hood um unless you know what
[51:09] you're looking at so we like to simplify
[51:11] everything so if we're not careful as we
[51:13] grow up because I think this is the
[51:14] problem today in the message because of
[51:17] of of we're now a couple Generations
[51:19] into this okay we're a couple
[51:21] Generations into this and so we have
[51:23] seen these things happen over and over
[51:25] and over again and heard the same words
[51:27] said and experience and so then we say
[51:30] that's an experience okay now that could
[51:31] be anything right that could that's how
[51:33] the Pentecostals believe speaking in
[51:35] tongues you had an experience okay but
[51:37] by
[51:41] definition in those scriptures an
[51:44] experience when discussed so we take
[51:46] that example of an experience in our
[51:48] personal lives in the church and we then
[51:50] when brother benam says experience we
[51:53] apply that to that so that's why we're
[51:55] looking at the definition of the word
[51:57] the apprehension of an object through or
[51:59] emotion through the senses or mind
[52:02] active participation in events or
[52:05] activities leading to the
[52:09] culmination of knowledge or
[52:12] skill the knowledge or skill so derived
[52:15] so you have you know someone like a
[52:17] carpenter or an engineer they have
[52:19] experience if they've had the chance to
[52:21] work in that field for a time they gain
[52:24] knowledge or skill an event or a series
[52:27] of events participated in or lived
[52:30] through you know I ex somebody
[52:33] experienced the war of Iraq right so
[52:36] they've lived through that the total to
[52:38] totality of such events in the past of
[52:41] an individual or group so experience is
[52:44] so much more than just emotion through
[52:47] senses that's that's just one of the
[52:49] meetings experience is
[52:52] knowledge the knowledge of Christ
[52:56] okay so it's not just an emotional
[52:59] senses or or something in your mind it
[53:01] goes much much deeper than that okay
[53:05] evidence we hear that word a lot as well
[53:08] evidence of the Holy
[53:12] Spirit Well what is evidence evidence is
[53:15] the available body of facts or
[53:18] information indicating whether a belief
[53:21] or proposition is true or
[53:24] valid
[53:25] information drawn from personal
[53:27] testimony a document or a material
[53:30] object used to establish facts in a
[53:32] legal investigation or admiss admissible
[53:35] as testimony in a law Court signs or
[53:38] indications of something the side out
[53:41] side has evidence that there's a church
[53:44] here called Grace
[53:47] Tabernacle there is evidence is pointing
[53:51] to
[53:53] something it's pointing to an individual
[53:57] it's pointing to a truth and in the
[53:59] context that we're talking about today
[54:01] because we are this is not a lecture we
[54:03] are talking about the evidence of
[54:07] Christ right we we we as Sons and
[54:09] Daughters of God with the revelation of
[54:11] the word even even outside of that
[54:13] people have can have revelation of of of
[54:16] God exists and they begin to see
[54:18] evidence supporting that theory then it
[54:22] becomes truth so now when you when
[54:25] evidence points you to a truth now you
[54:27] have an entirely different
[54:31] Benchmark cuz you are looking at
[54:33] everything through this truth that's
[54:37] right if you lack that truth your
[54:40] evidence is
[54:42] different
[54:44] circumstantial this means pointing
[54:46] indirectly towards someone's guilt but
[54:48] not conclusively proving
[54:50] it now you'll see the word guilt used a
[54:53] few times but what I mean is is is is a
[54:56] Vindication that God that you know
[54:58] Christ okay so not guilt Guilty by
[55:02] associ guilty because you are part of
[55:05] the body of Christ but not guilty in a
[55:07] negative way of a description containing
[55:10] full details okay direct means bearing
[55:13] immediately and unambiguously upon the
[55:16] facts at issue okay so we're talking
[55:19] about finding evidence a couple
[55:20] definitions there kind of got off this I
[55:23] lost you a little bit I could tell
[55:26] so couple definitions there now let's
[55:28] step into remember we we're looking
[55:30] experience is on trial our understanding
[55:34] our definition of experience what it
[55:36] really means is on trial and we're
[55:39] Desiring this isn't a this isn't a court
[55:41] case to to to to say well you're you
[55:43] know we're going to knock that off no
[55:45] this is this is more of an of of an ex
[55:48] of a uh we're looking to find the truth
[55:52] okay well I guess that is any court case
[55:54] circumstance schedle evidence is a type
[55:56] of evidence in legal proceedings that
[55:59] does not directly prove a fact but
[56:02] allows for an inference to be drawn
[56:04] about the occurrence of that fact
[56:06] circumstantial evidence relies on
[56:08] inference and deduction so there's
[56:12] there's a there's a there's a robbery
[56:14] you you know robbery just happened you
[56:16] pull up to the store and you see
[56:17] somebody running out of the building
[56:19] they jump in a car and they race away
[56:22] that's circumstantial evidence that they
[56:23] committed the robbery this involves
[56:26] facts and circumstances that when
[56:27] considered together lead to a reasonable
[56:30] conclusion about the existence of
[56:33] another fact stay with me direct
[56:36] evidence is evidence that directly
[56:38] establishes a fact so it's ey testimony
[56:41] it's it's video footage photographic
[56:43] evidence documents that directly prove a
[56:47] fact that something happened it's a
[56:49] tangible
[56:51] evidence in other words direct evidence
[56:53] is evidence that if believe believed
[56:55] proves a fact on its own
[56:58] okay you're all sitting in a church
[57:01] building that is direct evidence
[57:05] okay so now in in a court case there can
[57:08] be both circumstantial and direct
[57:12] evidence we're going to go to law school
[57:14] for a
[57:17] second but it'll help bring us bring us
[57:19] to our
[57:21] point so when is circumstantial evidence
[57:25] dismissed if it is dismissed when direct
[57:27] evidence is
[57:30] presented so if direct evidence is
[57:34] presented if the direct evidence is
[57:36] strong and conclusive the circumstantial
[57:38] evidence May no longer be necessary to
[57:41] prove because it may be deemed
[57:42] irrelevant okay so the directive
[57:44] evidence undermines the circumstantial
[57:46] then they can dismiss the circumstantial
[57:49] evidence if the direct and circle
[57:52] circumstantial evidence contradict each
[57:54] other
[57:55] they will dismiss circumstantial in
[57:57] favor of
[57:58] direct uh if if if the if if it's
[58:01] complimentary in nature the direct and
[58:03] circumstantial evidence May sometimes
[58:04] complement each other with the
[58:06] circumstantial evidence providing
[58:08] additional context and support for the
[58:10] direct evidence okay circumstantial
[58:13] evidence is still important even when
[58:16] direct evidence exists okay now to bring
[58:19] you to point brother brandham said bury
[58:23] your religion if it has no em
[58:26] motion circumstantial evidence supports
[58:30] direct evidence so they are kept
[58:33] together it can help to
[58:35] cor corroborate the direct evidence and
[58:38] provide a more complete picture of the
[58:42] events in question if the direct
[58:44] evidence is weak or inconclusive the
[58:46] circumstantial evidence may be crucial
[58:49] may be crucial to the case the burden of
[58:52] proof always remains with the
[58:53] prosecution to prove the defendant's
[58:55] guilt Beyond a reasonable doubt this
[58:58] includes considering all evidence both
[58:59] direct and circumstantial when reaching
[59:02] a verdict so the verdict we're after
[59:06] today is how do you
[59:10] know I'm me jump back to that
[59:14] slide oops wrong
[59:19] slide help me out guys um oh there we go
[59:21] it's still scrolling is the
[59:25] what role does an experience play in the
[59:26] New Birth what role does emotion play an
[59:29] experience how do we know we know Christ
[59:31] so the verdict
[59:33] is all of these have the same
[59:35] answer what is the
[59:37] conclusion how how do we know how do we
[59:41] know okay you know that person per se
[59:44] had an experience with God how do we
[59:46] know we had an experience with God if
[59:48] that's in question or just for
[59:50] definition sake how do we know what is
[59:53] that what is it May preach what is the
[59:55] Holy Ghost more than once it's important
[59:58] for you to know what this is what is the
[1:00:00] definition of this of of of this subject
[1:00:02] what how how does what are the
[1:00:04] implications of this how do we use this
[1:00:06] to judge
[1:00:10] situations excuse
[1:00:18] me get excited lose my
[1:00:23] voice so that's the verdict that we're
[1:00:26] after and now we are presented with with
[1:00:29] uh both sides so what is in the context
[1:00:32] of the Holy Spirit what is
[1:00:33] circumstantial
[1:00:36] evidence if threw a couple things in
[1:00:38] here it's not an exhaustive List full
[1:00:40] range of OT of full range of emotions
[1:00:43] within a church service holy dress
[1:00:45] coming to church testimony I mean you
[1:00:47] can all think of a lot of different
[1:00:48] things those are circumstantial evidence
[1:00:50] so they are
[1:00:52] important they are part of the verdict
[1:00:54] is am I or are they a son and daughter
[1:00:57] of God now the point of this sermon
[1:00:58] again is not for you to look across the
[1:01:00] Pew and say yep they don't have it or
[1:01:03] yes they have it that's not the point
[1:01:06] the point is I want Grace Tabernacle to
[1:01:08] know the truth
[1:01:11] amen I want you to know the truth this
[1:01:14] is not just some thing in out there in
[1:01:18] space well we got the holy ghost or they
[1:01:20] got the Holy Ghost no this is an
[1:01:22] important thing because many many times
[1:01:24] people people go through
[1:01:27] experiences where this is not even
[1:01:31] evidence there there is nothing
[1:01:32] supporting it and they are told
[1:01:34] something so they believe it that's
[1:01:36] right amen anytime in the book of
[1:01:40] kings that Israel went off the rails
[1:01:43] they took the king's word over Gods
[1:01:46] that's right the leadership's word over
[1:01:48] Gods I'm not saying we have a problem
[1:01:49] with our leadership here but I'm saying
[1:01:52] right now you should know you you
[1:01:54] responsible to know what the truth is
[1:01:57] about this subject cuz if you know then
[1:02:00] now you're a beacon of light because I'm
[1:02:03] going to tell you from personal
[1:02:05] experience this subject is very
[1:02:06] misunderstood in the church world today
[1:02:08] amen Message Church World very
[1:02:11] misunderstood and we just excuse it and
[1:02:13] say Well if they have it they don't have
[1:02:15] it but I have it well do you have it yes
[1:02:19] do you have the evidence to support your
[1:02:21] theory do you have the evidence to
[1:02:23] support your
[1:02:25] what you say is truth you come into the
[1:02:27] courtroom guess what they're going to
[1:02:30] take that evidence that you have
[1:02:31] presented and go through it front to
[1:02:35] back you're not going to decide your own
[1:02:37] verdict a jury is the jury and judge are
[1:02:41] both the same Jesus Christ so it that's
[1:02:44] why we have to examine Our Lives if this
[1:02:47] makes you uncomfortable
[1:02:50] today good go examine your life say God
[1:02:55] I I thought because I did this and this
[1:02:57] and this that's it or maybe you're
[1:03:01] struggling you're sitting there like man
[1:03:02] I wish I had the ghost wish I had the
[1:03:03] ghost and all the time you are Chuck
[1:03:06] full of the Holy
[1:03:09] Ghost you see this especially in camps
[1:03:12] now I'm not I I really I promise you I'm
[1:03:14] not trying to support an opinion or
[1:03:16] point across the fence not at all this
[1:03:18] is just experiences we're we're we're
[1:03:21] people are constantly feeling like they
[1:03:22] have to go back and get the Holy Ghost
[1:03:26] right because you're you're struggling
[1:03:28] and and and and uh and the uh amorites
[1:03:32] defeated you why did who was it who
[1:03:35] somebody help me out who was it that
[1:03:37] defeated Israel when Ahab had sinned a
[1:03:39] Ain had sinned he anybody to remember
[1:03:41] the name of the of the
[1:03:44] tribe he sinned at Jericho but okay
[1:03:47] whoever it was they fought next okay you
[1:03:49] all know what I'm talking about that
[1:03:50] tribe they fought next they lost to them
[1:03:53] not because they didn't Cross Jordan
[1:03:55] they already got the Holy Ghost they
[1:03:58] fell to them because in their cuz you
[1:04:00] talk about Israel now you could say as
[1:04:01] the whole church or as an
[1:04:04] individual there was something lingering
[1:04:06] in their lives that wasn't lining up
[1:04:08] with the word of God they had the Holy
[1:04:10] Ghost they were moving unto adoption
[1:04:13] right so you are on a journey moving
[1:04:16] unto adoption and you lose a battle you
[1:04:18] don't need to go back and cross Jordan
[1:04:20] again you've already been there you've
[1:04:22] already done that amen there you go but
[1:04:24] you are pursuing Perfection amen now you
[1:04:28] did something wrong you make it right
[1:04:30] right you kill aen that's right his
[1:04:31] whole family his cattle and you burn the
[1:04:34] booty with him
[1:04:36] everything there's no me remembrance you
[1:04:39] take the ashes and you throw them in the
[1:04:40] wind no remembrance of that get rid of
[1:04:43] it completely annihilate it that's why
[1:04:46] you ever wonder why Israel was so brutal
[1:04:47] that's why it's in a type for you and I
[1:04:50] that's how we need to treat sin in our
[1:04:52] lives amen don't stop till it's all gone
[1:04:56] amen
[1:05:00] amen but we just read here that
[1:05:04] circumstantial evidence is
[1:05:07] dismissed if it directly
[1:05:11] contradicts the direct
[1:05:14] evidence so someone has circumstantial
[1:05:16] evidence of the Holy Ghost you have
[1:05:19] circumstantial evidence of the Holy
[1:05:20] Ghost you're all here today looking very
[1:05:22] holy and dressed nice everybody here has
[1:05:25] circumstantial
[1:05:27] evidence but
[1:05:30] tomorrow later on
[1:05:32] today do you have direct evidence that's
[1:05:35] it because if you're feeding from a
[1:05:37] sistern that's it you won't that's right
[1:05:40] incidentally sisters get full of all
[1:05:42] kinds of junk that's
[1:05:44] right so pipes get clogged because
[1:05:47] there's giant cockroaches in the water
[1:05:48] or giant bugs in the water right rats
[1:05:51] fall in there squirrels fall in there
[1:05:54] oh Adam's not
[1:05:56] here
[1:05:58] but The Well of Living
[1:06:02] Water that's it nothing clogs that
[1:06:05] that's right that's exactly right A lot
[1:06:07] of times they'll find Wells that the the
[1:06:10] PSI or the whatever you call the the
[1:06:12] pounds the poundage the the the force of
[1:06:14] the water is astronomical they have to
[1:06:17] tone it down so it can come out your
[1:06:19] faucets at a mediocre speed so it
[1:06:21] doesn't blow your sink up right that's
[1:06:24] that we're talking about the most
[1:06:25] powerful well that there is on the face
[1:06:27] of the planet in in all of eternity in
[1:06:30] the universe and in the history of the
[1:06:32] world it is the power to blast through
[1:06:35] your corroded
[1:06:40] pipes the Holy Spirit comes in your life
[1:06:42] this is you got rotten pipes suddenly
[1:06:46] you got water everywhere because the
[1:06:48] Holy Spirit shines a light on your error
[1:06:51] amen so you go fix the pipes call the
[1:06:53] plumber
[1:06:56] to come fix it up fix your house so
[1:06:59] circumstantial evidence so we
[1:07:01] cannot so you can go on circumstantial
[1:07:04] evidence alone if direct evidence is not
[1:07:07] present but in our case direct evidence
[1:07:10] is always present right amen that's
[1:07:12] right it's always present amen so we
[1:07:16] cannot base our Eternal destination off
[1:07:19] of circumstantial evidence that's right
[1:07:21] we must base it upon the direct evidence
[1:07:24] but if your religion does not have
[1:07:26] emotion go bury it you need
[1:07:29] circumstantial
[1:07:31] evidence okay because these things
[1:07:33] manifest to the outside when Christ is
[1:07:36] inside of you this is what happens now
[1:07:39] not everybody does all ranges of
[1:07:40] emotions right I had to just include
[1:07:42] that I I'm really tired of the subject
[1:07:44] of emotion can I be honest with you I'm
[1:07:45] really tired of it like why do we even
[1:07:47] why are we why are we talking about that
[1:07:48] so much let's just get Christ and and
[1:07:51] get on with our lives just stop getting
[1:07:53] so so worried about that you clap or not
[1:07:55] I mean I think you should clap in
[1:07:56] respect to the Min and the song leader
[1:07:58] and help help the service but you dance
[1:08:00] you shout who cares cool great for you
[1:08:03] do you have Christ that's all I care
[1:08:05] about and that's all I want to preach
[1:08:07] about so I have to include it for the
[1:08:08] sake of the example but let's stop
[1:08:11] talking about it and just move on okay
[1:08:14] thank you holy spirit is the direct
[1:08:16] evidence now I went to make a list and I
[1:08:18] thought nope I'm going to leave this up
[1:08:20] to the
[1:08:21] prophet a court trial he says like we
[1:08:24] claim to be saved they say well show me
[1:08:26] how you're saved my life proves I'm
[1:08:31] saved
[1:08:33] see that's it praise
[1:08:36] God
[1:08:39] Amen I'm not amening
[1:08:42] myself I'm amening the word of God it's
[1:08:45] that simple amen
[1:08:48] folks it's that simple look at your life
[1:08:52] the the complicated part about it is
[1:08:55] looking at yourself yourself
[1:08:57] retrospectively but that's why the Holy
[1:08:59] Ghost is present that's why you come to
[1:09:01] church that's why you take communion
[1:09:04] remember that story of was that Danny
[1:09:05] Henry went to before the presence of God
[1:09:07] and every little thing he done wrong
[1:09:09] suddenly was glaringly obvious obvious
[1:09:12] if you have a life and you see somebody
[1:09:14] who's okay with with with with with
[1:09:18] sins um that aren't glaringly obvious
[1:09:22] because all Sin is Sin so there's no
[1:09:23] little and there's no big sins it's all
[1:09:25] sin but some of them are glaringly
[1:09:26] obvious obvious some of them are not you
[1:09:29] see somebody who's okay with that kind
[1:09:31] of stuff little R-rated movie here or
[1:09:33] PG-13 here little words here and
[1:09:36] there right
[1:09:40] then they come there's they're lacking
[1:09:43] the
[1:09:45] atmosphere so you say God I want to be
[1:09:47] as close to you as possible do the
[1:09:49] things that create the atmosphere in
[1:09:50] your home that's it okay amen so my life
[1:09:54] proves I'm saved so direct
[1:09:58] evidence the way I act proves whether
[1:10:00] I'm saved or not no matter how much I
[1:10:03] testify and it's interesting because I
[1:10:05] got this the quote I got this from is is
[1:10:07] from the Dynamics search message search
[1:10:10] um that Steve coffee and some some
[1:10:12] brothers over in
[1:10:15] um uh somewhere uh Puerto Rico or
[1:10:19] Portugal sorry they did and um the the
[1:10:22] the context is from I think it's from
[1:10:24] message Hub so Message Hubs all their
[1:10:28] quotes are I was actually I had a chance
[1:10:30] to be part of it I I didn't do it I was
[1:10:32] a young guy I was like no this is too
[1:10:34] much work but the the some of the youth
[1:10:36] and people at the church there they
[1:10:37] listened to the sermons and they typed
[1:10:38] it out so it was straight and fresh from
[1:10:40] the sermons and in this quote it says
[1:10:42] about a year you'll know in the table it
[1:10:46] says uh you about she'll he or something
[1:10:49] like that I didn't go and listen to it
[1:10:50] so go back and listen to this quot
[1:10:51] listen to what he says if he says about
[1:10:53] a year or not but I thought that was
[1:10:54] very interesting because it's a much
[1:10:56] different context when he says now no
[1:10:57] matter how much I testify about a year
[1:10:59] you'll know how I live whether I'm saved
[1:11:02] or not so in context I think it's about
[1:11:04] a year so in other words some time has
[1:11:06] to pass that's the point he's making
[1:11:08] there time has to pass I tell people all
[1:11:10] the time give it time tell people all
[1:11:11] the time give it time I tell people a
[1:11:13] lot give it time let time time isn't a
[1:11:15] miracle uh you did you know that time is
[1:11:18] a tool in God's hands yes it is he used
[1:11:21] time to bring out his Redemption plan
[1:11:23] amen
[1:11:24] so he's he's Eternal but he used time to
[1:11:26] bring out his Redemption plan so time is
[1:11:29] a tool in God's
[1:11:31] hands that's why gel that's why
[1:11:33] Nicodemus said the same thing give it
[1:11:36] time that's right okay yeah here
[1:11:39] fighting against God what Les she be
[1:11:42] fight found fighting against
[1:11:46] Goden so that's why some someone gets
[1:11:49] saved comes to the church we don't
[1:11:51] immediately put them in office give them
[1:11:53] time right amen we they could have been
[1:11:56] they could have had the most profound
[1:11:59] experience now I'm using the context of
[1:12:03] emotional or mind or or changing of
[1:12:05] their life experience where that they
[1:12:07] just everything changes
[1:12:09] boom I don't care because there's a
[1:12:12] Bible a scripture in the Bible says the
[1:12:13] seed fell and sprang up quickly that's
[1:12:16] right but life killed it that's exactly
[1:12:18] why because it wasn't didn't have a
[1:12:20] foundation in the word it didn't have an
[1:12:23] exp experience that's right a revelation
[1:12:26] okay so you give people time amen that's
[1:12:30] where a lot of times people get caught
[1:12:31] up in in schemes and and and and and
[1:12:35] um uh
[1:12:37] scams give it time give it a second
[1:12:41] think about it sleep on it I mean just
[1:12:44] take that one example if we're talking
[1:12:45] to personal lives take that one thing
[1:12:47] apply that and you will minimize 80% of
[1:12:51] the M the the the the bad decisions you
[1:12:54] make sleep on it that is totally my
[1:12:57] opinion so same way it is by healing if
[1:13:01] you accept it and believe it you're
[1:13:02] going to act like it so he's preaching
[1:13:04] court trial he's talking about Mr
[1:13:06] skeptic Mr impatient and Mr unbeliever
[1:13:09] and they said well I was prayed to be
[1:13:10] healed nothing happened and so that's
[1:13:12] the context of the sermon he's
[1:13:14] ministering on so he says same way by
[1:13:16] healing if you accept it believe it
[1:13:18] you're going to act like it you have to
[1:13:20] give it time amen right brother M said
[1:13:24] the angel comes your way okay
[1:13:27] so there's going to be such because
[1:13:29] God's trying your faith not because God
[1:13:32] can't do it then oh sorry I'm going to
[1:13:34] have to put you okay you got cancer you
[1:13:36] need to be healed I can schedule you for
[1:13:38] uh September 23rd 2025 can you live till
[1:13:42] then that's not God God is Not inhibited
[1:13:46] by time he us his time okay
[1:13:50] so he's testing your faith there's going
[1:13:53] to be such a change in you there's
[1:13:54] nothing can take it out of your mind
[1:13:56] he's testing your faith for yourself as
[1:13:59] well that's exactly he's building
[1:14:02] character because if you have to have
[1:14:03] faith for a longer period of time it's
[1:14:05] kind of like it's kind of like um stress
[1:14:07] over time right that's what builds
[1:14:09] resistance is stress over time that that
[1:14:13] they stole that straight from God's
[1:14:14] laboratory remember the devil can't
[1:14:15] create anything he can only pervert it
[1:14:17] so stress over time has been proven time
[1:14:20] and again by science to increase
[1:14:22] endurance
[1:14:24] so you want to run a marathon you you
[1:14:26] can't just run a mile once a day you're
[1:14:28] not putting your body underneath enough
[1:14:30] stress for a long enough time so you go
[1:14:33] the marathon you'll fall apart about
[1:14:35] mile three four maybe okay so God puts
[1:14:39] you under stress over time to increase
[1:14:41] your faith endurance that's right
[1:14:46] amen
[1:14:48] so there's going to be such a change in
[1:14:51] you there's nothing can take it out of
[1:14:52] your mind no no more than your salvation
[1:14:55] it's God's word you've got to accept it
[1:14:57] on the same basis by faith you are saved
[1:15:00] Jesus said to the woman who touched His
[1:15:02] Garment he said thy faith has saved thee
[1:15:04] that's right now see okay she touched
[1:15:06] His Garment she was healed instantly her
[1:15:09] faith that's right her faith was already
[1:15:11] at the point it needed to be right amen
[1:15:13] that's right she why because she had
[1:15:15] heard about him amen he wasn't a
[1:15:18] stranger who walked by she knew who she
[1:15:21] was touching oh pra God if you know who
[1:15:24] you're touching what a difference that
[1:15:26] makes in your life what a difference
[1:15:29] that'll make in the decisions you make
[1:15:30] if you know who you are that's why
[1:15:32] that's so important you want evidence
[1:15:34] you want direct evidence that God show
[1:15:36] me where I am who I am today know who
[1:15:39] you're touching amen how did she know
[1:15:41] she read about it she heard about it y
[1:15:44] that's it every time there was a new uh
[1:15:47] every every every Sunday or whatever
[1:15:49] whenever she got the paper she went
[1:15:51] straight to the front page cuz Jesus
[1:15:52] made Front Page News for three and a
[1:15:53] half years she went to the front page
[1:15:55] what's Jesus doing today oh when the the
[1:15:58] Pharisees had a comment or two to the
[1:16:00] journalist she excused it his unbelief
[1:16:02] and she kept reading now what did he do
[1:16:05] that's right what did he do and she knew
[1:16:07] who she was touching many times that's
[1:16:09] where our faith lacks it's because we
[1:16:11] don't know who we're praying to that's
[1:16:13] it that's exactly right we're not
[1:16:15] praying to The Ether we're not praying
[1:16:16] to the void we are praying to the God
[1:16:20] who created you amen right amen and if
[1:16:23] you know this if you if you search out
[1:16:25] the matter if you know what God's word
[1:16:28] says then you know what he's capable of
[1:16:31] Amen if you never heard that God saved
[1:16:34] could you believe he could save you no
[1:16:37] absolutely
[1:16:41] not you've got to accept it on the same
[1:16:43] basis okay now I'm not a scholar by a
[1:16:46] long ways but I have looked up a few
[1:16:48] words now that word there comes from the
[1:16:50] Greek word Soo which means save just
[1:16:52] like material ially saved or spiritually
[1:16:54] saved you're saved Soo he saved her from
[1:16:57] a premature grave just the same as he
[1:16:59] saves you from Hell Soo the same Greek
[1:17:01] word is used notice thy faith Soo has
[1:17:04] saved thee from the sickness that you
[1:17:06] had notice same word every time amen
[1:17:11] amen another circumstantial
[1:17:14] evidence addressed in this quote that's
[1:17:18] right fleshly
[1:17:19] demonstrations but what is the truth of
[1:17:22] it the seed is wrong to begin with
[1:17:24] that's exactly right am that's really
[1:17:27] powerful that's right absolutely it's
[1:17:30] really powerful when you can tap into
[1:17:31] the Revelation that every seed brings
[1:17:34] forth of its kind we we say that we have
[1:17:37] I've heard that my entire
[1:17:39] life but you have to come to the
[1:17:41] realization of that you have to see that
[1:17:43] in practice you have to see that
[1:17:45] happening that's it will you realize
[1:17:47] there's no other thing you can do
[1:17:51] amen so what do we want to water that's
[1:17:54] it we don't want to water the
[1:17:56] weeds we don't want to water them we
[1:17:58] want to water the wheat that's we want
[1:18:00] to water the true word of God amen amen
[1:18:04] you know somebody said to me one time
[1:18:05] and if they if this gets back to them
[1:18:07] we're we're we're bosom friends and and
[1:18:09] we we had these discussions before but
[1:18:11] they said to me well yes but why don't
[1:18:13] we you know yeah we know there's fakers
[1:18:15] in there but but but but what about the
[1:18:17] real ones so we're going to we're going
[1:18:18] to keep focusing on circumstantial
[1:18:20] evidence was basically what he was
[1:18:22] saying
[1:18:23] and and I I I it just didn't sit right
[1:18:25] with me and I and I I thought about it I
[1:18:27] thought about it for
[1:18:28] months and and I just I had this I was
[1:18:31] singing about it one night and I believe
[1:18:33] God spoke to my heart and he said why
[1:18:35] Point him to the thing that can
[1:18:37] be faked that's it when you can point
[1:18:41] them to the thing that can't be that's
[1:18:43] it that's right that's right that's why
[1:18:45] I'm saying why are we talking about
[1:18:46] emotions
[1:18:47] still let's Point Let's Point each other
[1:18:51] let's point the church to the thing that
[1:18:54] can't what's the word somebody help me
[1:18:55] what's the word that brother bam used
[1:18:56] reproduced
[1:18:57] or ah you talk about the third
[1:19:02] poll okay I can't remember the word but
[1:19:04] he says this thing cannot be imperson
[1:19:07] impersonated thank you let's Point them
[1:19:09] into the thing that can't be
[1:19:11] impersonated we talk about we talk about
[1:19:13] hey you know it's all let's talk about
[1:19:14] the real let's talk about the real and
[1:19:16] not worry about the fake then why are we
[1:19:18] talking about the fake why are we
[1:19:20] talking about fleshly demonstrations and
[1:19:22] emotions and all of this things and all
[1:19:23] we got to impersonate the Pentecost look
[1:19:26] go read the book of Acts it wasn't just
[1:19:28] chapter 2 there's several chapters where
[1:19:31] they just they just lived their lives
[1:19:33] they endured persecution they kept to
[1:19:35] the word of God they had all night
[1:19:37] meetings where Paul just stood up there
[1:19:38] and talked that's right I mean the guy
[1:19:40] fell asleep and died right that was the
[1:19:43] book of Acts amen that's
[1:19:47] right forgive me
[1:19:50] if so the seat is wrong to begin with so
[1:19:52] so all your fleshy demonstrations don't
[1:19:54] mean nothing that's right though I speak
[1:19:56] with tongue of men and angels and have
[1:19:58] not charity it profit me nothing though
[1:20:02] I could move mountains and have not
[1:20:03] charity it profiteth profit me nothing
[1:20:06] though I give all my goods to feed the
[1:20:08] poor and have not charity it profit me
[1:20:10] nothing if I speak with tongue like men
[1:20:12] and Angel it becomes like sounding brass
[1:20:15] and tinkling symbols listen Church
[1:20:18] Pentecostal nothing why it's a hybrid SE
[1:20:23] am he's talking about the Pentecostal
[1:20:25] denominations it can't come to the word
[1:20:28] now there you
[1:20:30] are that's it that's
[1:20:40] rightall in 1 Corinthians
[1:20:44] 2 verse
[1:20:46] 11 I don't have this one on the
[1:20:49] slides the scriptures say something that
[1:20:53] I just just hit
[1:20:59] me for what man knoweth that's it okay
[1:21:03] they're going to bring it up for us give
[1:21:05] them a second it's 1 Corinthians
[1:21:08] 2:1 for what man knoweth the things of
[1:21:12] man save the spirit of man which is in
[1:21:17] him a lion has a lion Spirit that's it
[1:21:21] and could never do do the things of a
[1:21:24] man that's right
[1:21:26] ever they can't walk on two
[1:21:31] feet I'm going to jump to it so I can
[1:21:33] see before and after
[1:21:37] scriptures they cannot do the things of
[1:21:40] a man because the spirit of man is not
[1:21:43] in them that's right to have a to have
[1:21:45] to have to consciously be aware that you
[1:21:48] are an individual and that you can use
[1:21:51] your hands and you can think rationally
[1:21:53] and you can make decisions and and and
[1:21:57] and and all of these things you have to
[1:21:59] have the spirit of man someone who is a
[1:22:02] man that I'm not saying man I'm talking
[1:22:05] broad male and female here just
[1:22:08] person can't do any of those things what
[1:22:11] do we call them
[1:22:17] dead even so the things of God knoweth
[1:22:21] no man man amen you literally cannot
[1:22:26] know God outside of the spirit amen of
[1:22:31] God if you approach the scriptures
[1:22:34] through the spirit of man you will miss
[1:22:39] God
[1:22:41] absolutely if you approach a service
[1:22:44] underneath the spirit of man that's it
[1:22:47] you will complain about the length
[1:22:49] that's it or the short that's it but if
[1:22:52] if you're there to hear what God has to
[1:22:55] say because you come under the spirit of
[1:22:58] God who are you going to hear that's
[1:23:01] exactly right you're going to hear God
[1:23:04] if you judge something by the spirit of
[1:23:08] man you will judge it outside of God
[1:23:13] that's right that is exactly man the the
[1:23:16] the the the existence and the mental
[1:23:19] faculty of a human being has so many
[1:23:24] branches based on experiences and
[1:23:27] information that we have collected over
[1:23:29] our lifetimes and and and biases and and
[1:23:33] and and and all these things but the
[1:23:36] center of that should always be
[1:23:39] truth amen the world loves to say well
[1:23:43] that's just your bias and that's his
[1:23:45] bias and this is my bias and say there's
[1:23:47] no truth that's not
[1:23:51] true to know the word of God you must
[1:23:55] come at it through the spirit of God
[1:23:59] Amen say brother Chris we have heard
[1:24:02] that yes I hope every service you've
[1:24:05] heard it
[1:24:06] already God brings us out on the youth
[1:24:09] this morning in young adults class he
[1:24:10] bring us the word from different angles
[1:24:13] because you look at me if you just if
[1:24:15] you only ever saw this half of my face
[1:24:17] and you saw this hack you your brain
[1:24:19] would have a hard time determining is
[1:24:21] that Chris take yeah you need a full
[1:24:24] view you can't just get God from one
[1:24:27] angle that's why he gave the fivefold
[1:24:31] ministry which if you think about it
[1:24:33] five is the full circumference of our
[1:24:36] hand that's it in other words complete
[1:24:39] amen complete the fivefold ministry is
[1:24:42] complete amen all of that we must have
[1:24:47] to bring us a balance but we have to
[1:24:50] approach it with the spirit of of
[1:24:53] God you
[1:24:55] cannot see see it without Christ amen
[1:25:00] and I
[1:25:06] so but if if you go back up to verse 9
[1:25:09] says but at as it is written I hath Not
[1:25:12] Seen Nor Ear heard neither have entered
[1:25:14] into the heart of man the things which
[1:25:16] God hath prepared for them that love
[1:25:19] him but God hath revealed them unto us
[1:25:22] by his
[1:25:26] spirit for the spirit search all things
[1:25:29] y the Deep things of God searches the
[1:25:33] Deep things of
[1:25:35] God don't excuse it don't don't don't
[1:25:39] don't say well you know hey you know
[1:25:41] you're getting too technical it just got
[1:25:44] to be Holy Ghost and we're down here no
[1:25:47] no no no no you can't even search out
[1:25:50] the things without the holy Holy Ghost
[1:25:52] that's right it's not the end it's the
[1:25:55] beginning amen that's right we want to
[1:25:58] we want to we want to pursue we want to
[1:25:59] come under Perfection because when we
[1:26:01] reach Perfection What do we do we leave
[1:26:02] this earth because our okay so here's
[1:26:05] the thing the reason you leave this
[1:26:07] flesh
[1:26:09] robe is because it's imperfect that's it
[1:26:12] and when your spirit your soul becomes
[1:26:16] perfect that's it the two can't stay
[1:26:18] together that's right that is why Enoch
[1:26:20] raptured that's right he had the rare
[1:26:23] experience because God wanted to make an
[1:26:25] example where his soul reached
[1:26:28] Perfection and his body couldn't hold
[1:26:30] him amen that's why we must always
[1:26:33] pursue Perfection we must always be
[1:26:36] seeking for a higher order a higher
[1:26:39] plane a higher station a a a a the
[1:26:43] highest rung of the ladder because we
[1:26:45] want to we want to come to that position
[1:26:49] amen and then we're gone amen that's why
[1:26:52] we have a theophany CU God said hey I
[1:26:53] can't have souls just drifting around in
[1:26:55] eternity I want to seeed them so he made
[1:26:58] a body for you that's perfect that your
[1:27:00] soul can then come
[1:27:02] into super technical sounding but it's
[1:27:04] the truth go read your Bible that's what
[1:27:06] happens so Brother Paul's been preaching
[1:27:10] on this the cup of iniquity if you fill
[1:27:13] the cup with Christ with the Holy Ghost
[1:27:16] the iniquity automatically flows out of
[1:27:19] it that's right so if you got problems
[1:27:21] in your life life you don't focus on
[1:27:24] those problems you focus on getting more
[1:27:26] Christ and he will push those problems
[1:27:28] out and he does so by giving you divine
[1:27:32] inspiration and wisdom on how to address
[1:27:35] them sometimes problems are not as
[1:27:37] simple as stop doing sometimes there are
[1:27:39] complicated complex things that we have
[1:27:41] to deal
[1:27:45] with for the spirit searches all things
[1:27:48] he the Deep things of God that's it
[1:27:50] verse 12 now we have received not the
[1:27:52] spirit of the world but the spirit which
[1:27:54] is of god that we might know the things
[1:27:57] that are freely given to us see amen see
[1:28:01] it's been freely given but you got to
[1:28:04] have the spirit of God to know
[1:28:07] it what is experience what is
[1:28:16] evidence the spirit of God Amen they
[1:28:19] Revelation that I don't belong here
[1:28:22] that's
[1:28:23] it how do you come to that revelation of
[1:28:26] I don't belong here that's right you
[1:28:30] come to that by SE searching out that's
[1:28:33] right the matter by by by by by pursuing
[1:28:38] the Deep things of God Amen because as
[1:28:41] you learn about him see your mind your
[1:28:44] your body everything guess what where
[1:28:46] did it come from the
[1:28:50] earth the Dust
[1:28:53] so you have a lot of unpacking to do yes
[1:28:58] a lot you take somebody who's been who's
[1:29:01] been been been been told for 20
[1:29:04] years never had a mirror been told for
[1:29:07] 20 years they're
[1:29:12] green try and talk them out of
[1:29:14] that
[1:29:16] impossible impossible till you show them
[1:29:19] a mirror y that's it see you are
[1:29:23] actively talking yourself out of
[1:29:27] damnation yes sir amen by what pursuing
[1:29:31] the Deep things of God guys don't be a
[1:29:35] surface level
[1:29:37] Christian if you are a surface level
[1:29:39] Christian you'll live a surface level
[1:29:41] life that's right there is so much in
[1:29:45] here I mean okay this is just a
[1:29:49] slice of God yes sir
[1:29:52] yes I mean this in comparison to who God
[1:29:56] is you you cannot even see it you could
[1:29:59] have put it on the tip of a pen you
[1:30:00] couldn't put on the tip of a needle this
[1:30:03] broke but this is what he gave us that's
[1:30:06] right in other words this is the slice
[1:30:08] we need amen amen so is it good enough
[1:30:13] to just know by grace are you
[1:30:16] saved no is it good enough to know well
[1:30:20] brother randam was sent by God Malachi 4
[1:30:23] no no is it good enough to know
[1:30:25] justification sanctification baptism of
[1:30:27] the Holy Spirit baptism in the name of
[1:30:29] Jesus Christ no
[1:30:32] no because this book judges your life
[1:30:36] amen there are levels in our lives we
[1:30:39] have not even come close to touching
[1:30:42] that must be Min amen amen they must be
[1:30:47] excavated but we will never get to them
[1:30:49] if we don't get deeper into the things
[1:30:52] of God if we're too worried about
[1:30:54] dancing in church we will never get into
[1:30:58] the teaching of the word of Goden
[1:31:00] brother bandam says evangelism calls The
[1:31:03] Sinner to Christ he says teaching
[1:31:06] positionally places the church exactly
[1:31:09] right do you see why that is such a
[1:31:11] distraction in the world we live in
[1:31:13] right now in The Message Church world
[1:31:16] today why evangelizing and and high
[1:31:19] energy and and all of these kind of
[1:31:20] things why that is such a big deal and
[1:31:23] why it's important is because it's a
[1:31:25] distraction because it's the opposite of
[1:31:27] what we would call in our human Minds
[1:31:28] teaching although it's the same
[1:31:29] anointing that's right
[1:31:32] amen because where are we going to go
[1:31:34] how are we going to learn that we're the
[1:31:36] bride how are we going to know we don't
[1:31:37] belong here the word must be expounded
[1:31:41] to us amen if it was good enough for
[1:31:44] just justification you would have been
[1:31:46] born in Martin Luther's age that's it
[1:31:48] but you weren't that's it you were born
[1:31:51] today day amen and this is not going to
[1:31:54] be a popular opinion in the message
[1:31:57] that's it in the message it's not going
[1:31:59] to be a popular opinion but it's what's
[1:32:01] going to get you out of here amen is
[1:32:05] understanding who you are how can you
[1:32:07] understand who you are if you're
[1:32:08] constantly running
[1:32:10] around in the space of half an hour
[1:32:12] there was silence in
[1:32:15] heaven secretly God came down and said
[1:32:19] bride that's it is who I am that's it
[1:32:24] that's right exactly right and he
[1:32:26] slipped away and left the truth with you
[1:32:31] amen he's present right you understand
[1:32:37] example your life can take me back to
[1:32:40] the
[1:32:48] slides I do not believe saints of God
[1:32:50] that you can live
[1:32:53] a life with a higher
[1:32:55] standard and be if you want a life here
[1:32:58] I don't do not believe that your level
[1:33:01] of understanding of God can be here
[1:33:03] that's right amen it has to be here amen
[1:33:07] amen that's
[1:33:09] right you have to say I want to be a
[1:33:11] better Christian praying is
[1:33:13] not okay praying is enough okay because
[1:33:16] God will lead you to
[1:33:18] read right so maybe that where you start
[1:33:23] actually that's the best place to start
[1:33:24] say God I want to know you more give me
[1:33:27] wisdom and inspiration on what to read
[1:33:29] where to read it and when I read it
[1:33:32] speak to my heart that's why brother man
[1:33:34] said don't read it like a newspaper
[1:33:36] that's what he means that's what it
[1:33:38] that's what the meaning was that of that
[1:33:39] was the revelation of that subject for
[1:33:42] the man preached on the bride tree
[1:33:46] amen we love that topic in the world
[1:33:48] today when I say world I'm talking about
[1:33:51] message Church puts forth another Branch
[1:33:54] it'll be just like the book of
[1:33:57] Acts so I bring this example to to to
[1:34:00] bring this home not to point fingers or
[1:34:02] say anything
[1:34:03] anybody
[1:34:05] life cannot bring anything forth but the
[1:34:08] life it is but the vom saw that tree
[1:34:10] that had it had it had oranges and it
[1:34:12] had lemin and it had grapefruits and all
[1:34:15] these things and and and and and and and
[1:34:17] he
[1:34:18] says which I find it can I have a couple
[1:34:20] more minutes I find it amazing that he
[1:34:24] gives the story of the man first then he
[1:34:26] brings this example he's talking about
[1:34:29] the evidence in this man's life he said
[1:34:32] the guy was W was you know cutting up
[1:34:34] concrete for 25 to 30 cents an
[1:34:37] hour and then he surrendered his life to
[1:34:40] God and he said he has got five children
[1:34:43] he gave $3 million a
[1:34:47] year to the
[1:34:50] church never said how the man attended
[1:34:53] revivals and ran across a platform and
[1:34:56] spoke in tongues that was never
[1:34:59] addressed the evidence that brand Bram
[1:35:01] used was the life that's it he led
[1:35:05] exactly even if you don't have a if even
[1:35:08] if your paycheck is
[1:35:10] small you should have success to match
[1:35:12] that paycheck exactly because you a
[1:35:14] child of the
[1:35:18] king I can take that to heart better
[1:35:20] with things but anyway
[1:35:22] so he sees this tree and and he says
[1:35:24] well okay but but but but next year um I
[1:35:27] think exactly how he puts it but I'll
[1:35:29] just next year he says well okay if
[1:35:32] another Branch grows um or next year he
[1:35:35] says okay yeah but next year they'll all
[1:35:37] be oranges and he said no no no no the
[1:35:39] lemon Branch will be lemons the
[1:35:41] grapefruit Branch will be grapefruit and
[1:35:43] he says well what happens if the tree
[1:35:44] grows another limb says it'll be
[1:35:48] oranges you see saints of God do you
[1:35:51] know how long it takes another Branch to
[1:35:54] grow and then to put forth
[1:35:57] fruit
[1:35:59] time but time is your evidence time is
[1:36:02] your direct evidence circumstantial
[1:36:04] evidence will
[1:36:07] support if if the circumstantial
[1:36:09] evidence and the direct evidence lines
[1:36:10] up and it's an orange then you can keep
[1:36:13] the circumstantial evidence it
[1:36:15] supports circumstantial evidence is it's
[1:36:18] a tree and it's an orange tree and it's
[1:36:20] growing another branch
[1:36:22] right but come fall time they're all
[1:36:25] branches on the same
[1:36:28] tree through the winter well it's Citrus
[1:36:31] in or California so maybe in the winter
[1:36:33] is when it grows but in the off seon
[1:36:35] it's just a bunch of branches but then
[1:36:37] leaves come out and leaves
[1:36:42] say h circumstantial evidence is saying
[1:36:45] you're not an orange Branch that's it
[1:36:48] circumstantial evidence is saying you're
[1:36:49] not a that you're not a lemon
[1:36:54] branch and many people will go off the
[1:36:56] leaf alone but you want direct evidence
[1:36:59] yeah let the fruit that's it let the
[1:37:02] fruit come forth that's the focus that
[1:37:06] should be our Focus are the fruits of
[1:37:08] Our
[1:37:10] Lives proving the presence of
[1:37:14] Christ or are the fruits of our life
[1:37:17] withering
[1:37:19] up because you can be a child of God
[1:37:21] but the fruit
[1:37:23] just it's an orange but I wouldn't eat
[1:37:25] it that's it right that's exactly right
[1:37:28] but you fertilize the tree you protect
[1:37:31] it from the
[1:37:33] bugs and then you wait a whole season a
[1:37:37] whole year if you will to see did it
[1:37:41] work and the oranges come out and
[1:37:44] they're just perfect am God says amen
[1:37:48] peel that thing
[1:37:49] open that's a life pleasing to God Amen
[1:37:53] but the Holy Spirit you see brother
[1:37:54] talking about adoption he says the Holy
[1:37:56] Spirit Come to him and said Your son's
[1:37:58] not doing what he should be doing he's
[1:37:59] feeding them weeds and all this stuff
[1:38:02] all the while that man is a holy ghost
[1:38:04] filled Son of God but he's not come to
[1:38:08] adoption that's
[1:38:09] it amen you have to come to adoption
[1:38:13] here in this Earth because what good is
[1:38:16] the ability to write
[1:38:17] checks in heaven that's it
[1:38:22] you don't you people say well adoption
[1:38:23] is when we Rapture I'm sorry the ability
[1:38:26] to write a
[1:38:27] check I don't need that in heaven amen
[1:38:30] that's right there's no
[1:38:32] banks it's all free amen because I've
[1:38:35] already paid the price amen he's already
[1:38:38] paid the price but you need adoption
[1:38:40] here so therefore if you take those
[1:38:42] truths you see you take truths and you
[1:38:44] run them through the scriptures and I'm
[1:38:46] closing magicians want to come you take
[1:38:48] those truths and run through the
[1:38:49] scripture they disprove a lot of things
[1:38:51] because a lot of those things are based
[1:38:52] on circumstantial
[1:38:54] evidence but if he takes the truth like
[1:38:57] the checks are no good in heaven you
[1:38:59] don't need those there right you got to
[1:39:00] be adopted here and then you take that
[1:39:02] truth you say have to be adopted here
[1:39:05] you have to have the Holy Spirit and the
[1:39:06] Holy Spirit is the inward teacher he's
[1:39:08] the tutor and you don't have the tutor
[1:39:10] until you have the Holy Spirit then that
[1:39:12] means there's this point in time where
[1:39:14] you can be a holy ghost filled child of
[1:39:16] God not acting like it
[1:39:20] amen that's it Bud Southwick had a
[1:39:24] problem with
[1:39:26] smoking we know the story it's an
[1:39:29] awesome
[1:39:31] story what gave him the ability to
[1:39:34] quit the Holy Spirit that's right he
[1:39:37] already had it two days before puffing
[1:39:39] on a cigarette he was the Holy Ghost
[1:39:40] filled Son of God Amen but then
[1:39:42] something happened and
[1:39:44] finally finally he caught a revelation I
[1:39:47] don't need this that's not every EXP
[1:39:51] experience is overnight saints of God
[1:39:53] not every experience does somebody get
[1:39:54] saved and quit smoking and quit all that
[1:39:56] stuff right then and there in that
[1:39:58] moment that's not always the truth
[1:40:00] that's right okay now take it a step
[1:40:03] higher because I don't believe any of us
[1:40:05] have those problems take it a step
[1:40:07] higher your bad
[1:40:10] attitudes your your your grievances your
[1:40:13] your offenses your your little things
[1:40:15] and your isms and your clicks and and
[1:40:16] and you see it this way and you know you
[1:40:19] know you say well I'm going to sit s on
[1:40:21] the back pew to just show them and stuff
[1:40:24] like that what what what's
[1:40:25] that you're not you're not adopted right
[1:40:30] an adopted son of God has Divine love
[1:40:33] amen acts with
[1:40:35] maturity as far as serving God and it
[1:40:39] reflects in the Natural Life see
[1:40:41] somebody who can't you see we we we want
[1:40:43] to talk about I just make one last point
[1:40:45] we want to talk all about the experience
[1:40:47] and all of these things and we can't
[1:40:49] even have a good marriage
[1:40:51] yeah our children are falling AP falling
[1:40:53] apart I'm sorry there's something
[1:40:56] missing
[1:40:57] there you need teaching you need
[1:41:00] teaching on how to lead a family
[1:41:03] according to the word of God yeah how to
[1:41:05] deal with your children when they're
[1:41:07] young when they're middle when they're
[1:41:09] you know in their late you know 10 age
[1:41:12] when they're teenagers when they're
[1:41:14] adults how how they how they go to be
[1:41:15] married if the Holy Ghost was the magic
[1:41:17] pill we wouldn't have to teach the young
[1:41:18] adults how to find the right mate
[1:41:21] yeah but that's where we've come to in
[1:41:23] the message World well just get the Holy
[1:41:25] Ghost you'll find the right one no you
[1:41:26] won't no that's right that is not
[1:41:29] enough because you need to know what the
[1:41:31] word says now God can lead you on your
[1:41:33] own he can have mercy and sovereignty to
[1:41:36] lead you on your own but he will lead
[1:41:38] you through the scriptures you're not
[1:41:39] just going to walk through your life
[1:41:40] suddenly catch it no you're going to
[1:41:41] have to spend time in the word of God In

[1:42:06] find the evidence to support
[1:42:08] it and we would realize that this is
[1:42:11] this is is so much more than just than
