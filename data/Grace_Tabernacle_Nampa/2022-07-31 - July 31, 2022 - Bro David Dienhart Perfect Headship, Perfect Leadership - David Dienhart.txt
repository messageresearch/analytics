him up in prayer and then sister sue if you're listening right now i just had this thought crossed my turn on the prayer lines listen to the prayer lines amen i believe in dan's healing not only in his healing but i believe god will restore him so amen this may be just a knock on the door i'm just gonna be bold like our pastor just as we get older we get bolder so we're just gonna claim brother dan amen his healing and also lord would just touch his heart we want to remember sister miriam dean hart this morning she's not feeling well she just needs a touch on her body and let's just lift her up in prayer and if you have any needs on your heart raise your hands or heavenly father brother chris if you come [Music] amen asking is the first step in faith to believe it to come to pass let's bow our heads heavenly father lord jesus lord and you were here lord jesus you imparted to the people that they would ask it shall be given to them if they would seek they would find lord that first step in faith lord jesus is making that request to our father because it shows that we trust you lord we have faith that lord you are a god who who answers prayer lord we don't put requests to be known of others but we put these requests forward because you have shown us and proven to us time and time again that god you keep your word lord so we're calling on you again this morning father as your children we have needs and requests lord in our midst father healing lord jesus for our brother dan lord other the different needs that are in our with us this morning father i think brother sergey is out on the road lord may just keep him safe father and lord jesus ultimately father we want a spiritual touch this morning lord we have physical needs and earthly needs lord jesus but god the most important thing to us is our spiritual condition lord so we ask that you just speak to our hearts this morning that you would move our brother david aside lord that father you would have your way we love you lord we thank you may the blessed tithe in the offering lord bless the giver and the receiver may all things be done for your glory father thank you for this opportunity lord to be in your midst this morning in jesus name we pray amen amen again i greet you all you're joining with us online now god bless you good to have you just a note for our youth youth meeting friday august 12th at 7 00 p.m at the takes house and also grace kids will be having theirs as so let's as we get back into the swing of things let's be in prayer for our young people again let's not forget about them and uh also this uh coming sunday august 7th we're having communion and that'll be at five o'clock i'll be in prayer for that and i have a note here then i'll ask for the paul to come just wanted to thank everybody for last sunday i forgot wait a sunday so everybody was here but thank you i know my wife and i were pleasantly surprised and it's not really hard to surprise my wife especially she has those woman intuitions and so we want to say thank you it was really is really special and and uh i was given a new binder i haven't used yet because i haven't finished collecting all the songs we were cleaning up the song book so as soon as that done is done you're going to see me with a fancy new binder so just i can't remember who who gave that that's alice it was alice okay well alice you just wait i thought it was i was like wow this is really cool it has my name on it's all bold letters and song leader song book so i'm looking forward to be able to use it because this one is literally falling apart so i don't think that i can't remember the last time i even changed this so brother paul why don't you come so again i just wanted to say thank you for my wife and i it was it was it was really special isn't it nice to go to a church that we can just be human yeah not too human but human enough just to enjoy life well i think most of you would have saw uh on the church whatsapp that brother yannick sister sharon and now have a beautiful little addition to their family and uh you know he kind of looked trust up with some extra hardware there in the picture but i'm sure that when that's all taken away he's going to just be a really handsome little guy marian neville amen so just looking forward to seeing that little guy see them in church amen sister april has uh just shared with us that she will be in town the end of this coming week as she has to meet a moving van imagine i think that's commitment and anyway i don't know that she will want or need help but i just want to lay this out before you that maybe you could just put that in the corner of your mind that if she needs some help that we could just show her a warm welcome to our assembly and uh offer a little bit of help and you know any commitment that big the devil's gonna fight so she just has a couple situations that she needs the lord to just come and intervene in and one of those is the selling of her home and she's already had people who commit and then back out so we just want to lift her up in prayer to be able to sell her house and so just i reference it this way i think you would understand brother sergey senior which in my little vocabulary is sister yulia's dad shared with me this morning and a need and i was communicating with our sergey which is how i often view brother sergey as our sergey community property sister yulia but anyway i was just communicating with brother sergey today and and he was sharing with me the sunrise on highway 30 in wyoming was beautiful this morning and uh it if you understand our brother you know that means it's pedal to the metal towards home and uh but um there's a need a a brother vladimir ivano ivanov ivano they lived in the city of mariopol and at this point in time to his knowledge their house has actually been completely destroyed all their possessions everything has been destroyed they have fled and this is part of the dynamics that only those people who live there and understand those things that works for me because they have fled to russia and of all things you would think they would be fleeing somewhere else but there is a connection in culture and all of that there that that would be hard to for me especially to explain but they have left the city and they fled and i had the name of the little town in russia but that was irrelevant and they're definitely in a tight position so while money will solve things right but um let's lift them up in prayer they're not the only families not the only believers that are experiencing this kind of turmoil where they're being uprooted and going somewhere else and finding it very difficult to reestablish he shared that the brother has a job he makes 500 dollars a month and rent a loan no utilities nothing new no food nothing else but rent alone takes 320 of the 500 dollars so um we just definitely want to lift them up in prayer and uh we are we don't want to jump the gun but we are we're working in a process with our our brothers to see what we can do what is the best avenue to help them so our first avenue is prayer and so let's just remember all of them today and uh just that god would be able to give an answer to the saints that are there in that turmoil and as the brother worded it in his letter he is used to uh being the one according to the scripture it's better to give than to receive and but he said it's very difficult for him to come into a situation to say can someone please help us so amen our prayers do we believe this this morning our prayers move mountains and so let's start with that first mountain with prayer and let god open all the doors that is necessary for the believers for the saints in ukraine russia on their behalf uh we just want to lift that now i want to take just a moment uh here i have the little um sunday school volunteer sheet and i think this is wonderful uh some of the names on here i think probably forgot that they are in sunday school so they wanted to help they want to volunteer they want to do something good but we want to kind of keep this all in perspective that we're not going to let you skip your sunday school class to help another and especially to help the the babies to hold the babies so each one of you i'll put this sheet back up but we are going to be moving forward uh to come back into sunday school i take full responsibility for a lot of this gap in time but we are we're moving forward to do this and i would just ask that those that were teachers last year if you or two years ago three years ago well we'll move on quickly from that those of you that were teachers in the past i would like a personal yes or no of whether you want to teach again and then we'll move forward to those that have offered to help and to do that we want to just kind of get this as it were from the top down to establish the teachers first and then to be able to help maybe give some of the young younger people young people a chance to you know step up and be a helper as it were because that's a lesson that is good for us all to learn to be able to be servants to one another and so i would like to hear uh from from the previous teachers uh whether you feel led to be a part of that there's something else that's also in the works but i want to get sunday school established before we step into the next phase so if you all just lift us up in prayer and just help us sometimes it's it's difficult we get busy in life and you know you want things to just be perfect and absolutely ready and everything so you delay delay and nothing really changed so we're just going to go forward now and work on getting everything in the perfect order as we go so um once again those that were teachers in the past please give me a definite yes or no and i'm going to be kind of like the little kids viewed their parents and maybe means no so i'm looking for a definite yes or no and uh that way we can start leaning on others uh maybe strong-owning different people pushing twisting coercing what are all the words that go with that so we can get re-established back in sunday school for the sake of our children so i love you all and god bless you and so just just remember this family there in russia and let's dive into the word this morning amen god bless you amen as we receive brother david's going to come and speak to us let's sing number 100 i want to live the way he wants me to live i want to live the way he wants me to live i want to give until there's just no more to give i want to love love till there's just no [Music] i want to live way he wants me to live i want to give until there's just no [Music] for i can never ever out love the lord one more time [Music] me to live i want to give until there's just no more to give i [Music] foreign [Music] why do you love the lord because he first loved you that's a great revelation i pray that god be quickened every individual that's here this morning that you realize christ loved you the only way that you could love him is that he first loved you and if he first loved you what do you have to fear because nothing shall be able to separate you from his love amen nothing nothing present nothing future nothing past above below anything is able to separate you from his love but we need to come to that rest and that peace that here it is love where is it it's in a body form amen christ himself is our love that's love where is it today in bride form same christ same one hallelujah amen thank you brother sister god bless you appreciate the songs this morning the leadership of the song i just exactly told brother jason i said no question it was in prayer actually i said lord i know you've laid on his heart what's needful here and it just certainly has gone along with this brother vladimir i think was a pastor in mary opal and i was in his home and ministered in his house in that little assembly there so i certainly am happy that the lord has got him out of there and he has his hand on him and we are praying and holding him up in prayer because prayer changes things amen this morning what's on my heart i pray that god would give us grace because it may appear a little scratchy but something that's been laid upon my heart you know a minister really needs to receive it first before he presents it to an assembly and what i'm speaking this morning appeal or reply excuse me to me also i'm a part of your body i'm a part of this assembly but it won't leave the word but i pray that it'll be received as such as it will be light upon your pathway how many is willing to receive correction from the lord i am too in fact that's what i desire every day the bible says we would receive it if we any little thing if you're born again the prophet said any little thing that's wrong he'll show you questions and answers 1964 he said he'll show you he'll reveal it so i pray that you would just give me the grace and liberty as a minister of the gospel to preach it's on my heart because i do not believe it's my thinking i believe this is what he wants and so i will have to stand someday before all of us here and give answer for what i said you believe that i do too and that makes me tremble because i must be certain and every minister should be certain that what they're bringing is with the word does not deviate we don't have a right to put our own thinking in anything of god's word let god bring forth what he wants we are just servants who's greater the servant or the one the servant serves the greater is the one he serves so don't look at the ministers being anything special you're the special but together we're part of him we're special in his sight amen amen let's bow our heads for a word of prayer and why don't we stand in honor of his presence you're in the presence of the king i believe that with all my heart i pray that each one of us would become so aware of that every day moment by moment daily living that we are in the present you are in the presence of the king amen heavenly father our father we're so glad that we can say our father because you're the head of this body of believers worldwide you're the head and lord there's nothing even can happen as your prophet said but what you have allowed it you're in control of your bride you're in control absolutely divine control over her and lord we get sidetracked many times because the devil in his sinus and subtleness will try to sidetrack us we're fighting a great battle a mighty battle the greatest battle ever fought every day but moment by moment daily lord your mercies we see from your word and showing us what our authority is in you and lord we thank you for this reality in revelation and lord your word and i pray that it'll be that way this morning your word will be a lamp unto our feet and a light to our pathway and i pray that we go out of here rejoicing over the fact that you love us so much you would make yourself known to us individually and reveal yourself to us we pray for further revelation you said the greatest thing that we could ask for was revelation of the word and it cannot be overemphasized the need of it and so god we pray that you would reveal your word bless your word and move me out of the way the lord the man is not seen but your voice is heard and that you are seen we pray for thy glory in jesus christ's name we ask these things amen amen i'd like you to turn with me to genesis chapter two i have three scriptures while you're standing i have many scriptures this morning and i want to take and i want to be very sensitive to the holy spirit here on what we bring to the people our steps are ordered do you believe that nothing happens by chance to a believer it's all ordained of god to a christian brother brahms and we know a christian is not just a term lightly used a christian by definition is one tabernacling deity it's actually christian means christ-like amen and so that's what we are here to bear that's what we're here to fulfill because we know the son of man is revealed again in our day it's back to wheat time it's back to seed time amen it's back to the himself again among us amen but it's the form that stumbles people so many times is the form we come in amen but it's the same person we have lights go out i don't know what lights went out anyway all right i think you still well you can still see me and i still see you so it's all that matters i've ministered sometime when the lights went out completely in the dark continued right on the lights come back on the devil just couldn't stand it he doesn't like the light so we know that has a better meeting than just human light i mean electric amen but you know what you're the light of the world because you possess the very literal life of christ as a bride and so therefore you are the light and the light shining in darkness today amen genesis 2 starting with verse 23. i want to title this perfect headship perfect leadership perfect headship perfect leadership now you can't add to perfect you can't take away perfect we might be able to in our term as human term perfect but when it's god's term of perfect nothing be added or taken away his word his will perfect will which is his word is flawless and that's a that's a deeper meaning than perfect it can't be flawed nothing it's ability to be flawed it's light you can't put a shadow of turning to god amen and it's because when you put a shadow to it you add something or take from them from it so may we understand and realize that it's to only believe is what god's looking for amen genesis 2 23 and adam said i want you to notice who said adam said this is now bone of my bones now we know the story here we could back up and god put him in a deep sleep and took from adam he didn't take another something outside of adam he took from adam and made he a woman and brought her to the man we also understand that adam's spirit which was feminist and masculine both that feminist spirit which was not another spirit it was adam's spirit the woman received and we're tied together in the binding tie of the same holy spirit of christ amen so he said and adam said this is now watch what he said bone of my bones and flesh of my flesh other words she is me okay bone of my bone flesh of my flesh she shall be called woman because she was taken out of man and she was meant to bring forth life she was a woman a man with a womb therefore shall a man leave his father and mother and cleave unto his wife and they shall be one flesh and they were both naked the man and his wife and were not ashamed i want you to go with me over here to revelation chapter 3. other sister i'm not preaching to find accolades i don't care anything about that not wanting to find uh seeking popularity i don't care anything about popularity what i want to do is bring the word for the season not only bring it but live it that should be the heart desire of every one of us because where the blood is applied is out of the word for the season if we walk in the light as he is in the light the blood of jesus christ cleanses us from all sin amen you're under the washing of the water of this word this morning amen i hope we can have an attitude to allow it to be god speaking to you personally that's my heart's desire revelations 3 14 and unto the angel that's the messenger of the church of the laodiceans right these things saith the amen we know the amen is absolute saith the amen the faithful and true witness the beginning of the creation of god the beginning of the creation of god hebrews chapter 10. i want you to hold that in your heart because this thing saith the amen the beginning of god's creation of himself in flesh amen hebrews chapter 10 and verse 5 wherefore when he cometh into the world when he cometh into the world he saith sacrifice and offering thou what is not but a body hast thou prepared me and i want to i want to we know when realized that was god the son god himself created himself a body stepped into that body that was the fullness of the godhead bodily believe that god was fully manifested in the human temple called the masterpiece that was the second adam but i want to take this a little deeper than that i want to come to the light of our day there's a body prepared for me i'm talking about me individually who i really am there's a body prepared sacrifice and offering he's not requiring some outward giving of a lamb or or or some kind of works affair to try to merit salvation salvation is a finished work amen but there is a body he has prepared he has prepared a body for me and you bride you may be seated but a body has self-prepared me who there was a body prepared for ever there was a body prepared verge adam said this is now bone of my bones this was in me this was abiding in me this come in me this was a this was me and and i i've got to manifest and bring forth that portion of me in their season but when god came to the earth in the manifestation of himself jesus christ the word living made flesh i was in him you were in him there was a body prepared for me amen and the revelation of who you are is contained right there amen because when because if you were in god's thinking and i pray that god will open this up and we know that the that the bride the existed in the thoughts of himself eternally they were his eternal thoughts of himself when he came to the earth and manifested himself in the fullness of the godhead bodily in that man i was in him that was a body prepared for me amen everything that god would judge me by cannot be judged contrary to that body because i was in him and i was in him i never i was always in him amen see so he said here he says now he is standing in the midst of the church this is a quote brother branham as he stands there revealing who he is in this last stage he calls himself the author of the creation of god this is another creation this has to do with the church right this this has to do with the church this is a special designation of himself this is a special designation of himself he is the creator of that church where were you created in christ how is he created spoken word how does he create his bride through the same way spoken word amen but they but where was you at the beginning you were in him you came to the earth in him everything that god required was provided in him you were perfect in him you still are perfect in him amen you the bible says you were you were accepted in the beloved case dismissed the revelation that you have personally is the revelation of jesus christ in you showing that you were in him already when he came to the earth he lived the life that god accepted for you it's finished and he couldn't unveil that he kept out of hidden mystery of that threefold purpose of how god all that god was he poured into christ and all that christ was he's poured into his body he kept that a hidden mystery but letting it out gradually until the end time when the seventh seal of those seals were broke amen because he comes to you personally it's like he did the little cousin he came to her personally none of the other cousins knew about it he came to her it wasn't a public show he came to her perfect perfectly on time he said do you know the reason why i'm here i'm looking for a wife and he unveiled her himself and his purpose for being here and brother branham said and in page 149 of the church age he said god has a heart purpose god has an eternal purpose a heart purpose to have a bride of his own choosing and that will he do amen when he came to the earth and manifested himself for our redemption i was in him i went to the cross in him i raised up with him how can god judge me unperfect when he shows me that i am perfect in him not physically perfect i'm not talking about this physical the phys i was not physically i was in his mind but i came into this body but we're there who was i there in him i was the living word in him that he said i can do nothing except my father show me i was in that spirit when he came i was in god who manifested himself in him amen and how do i know i was in him because that same spirit now lives in me identifying itself by keeping the promise of the word and recognizing it in our day and it's revealed to me amen he said he said he would reveal it when he would come he said i will show you things to come i will reveal my word i will hear it in you and reveal it to you he said bro man said there's your evidence of whether you have the holy ghost or not it keeps you lined with the word it's not your living it's his living now he lives in you you and him pouring out his life in you you and him are not separate you are one he's just himself in another form all right i don't want to get ahead of myself here let's let's go back here but just take these things step by step but he said but a body has self-prepared me i want to want you to see that individually for you a body has been paired was prepared for you in burnt offerings and sacrifices for sin thou hast had no pleasure see then said i lo i come in the volume of the book. what book's been opened your volume it's a revelation of himself but what is the revelation of himself in bride form amen amen you have to come to that position or you'll never be able to meet him in the air you'll have to see that yourself you can't see it in yourself you're not enough studying to make you see it yourself it takes the work of the holy ghost in you and the work of the holy ghost in you is to reveal these things to you hallelujah amen now he said lo i come in the volume of the book it is written of me to do thy will o god it's written of you the word was the complete revelation of jesus christ and brother brown said that word was his body amen he said and that word is his body amen it is his body a complete revelation of himself is his body hallelujah who finished the mystery of adam adam and eve made her the complete revelation of adam but she had to be manifest in her season in her time that's why it takes revelation but revelation comes by hearing the truth of this ministered amen the mystery of adam was revealed today the seals were tore off so the mystery of jesus christ the finished mystery could be revealed unveiled a mystery hidden and opened is an unveiling amen all right so he said he goes on he says he is the creator of that church heavenly argument created his own bride he created his own bride where were we created amen where were you there's only one book that tells you where you come from who you are and where you're going that's this book but it was sealed with seven seals the little book of revelation held the complete total mystery divine revelation and completion of himself the complete revelation of jesus christ that's where you stand amen that's where you stand that is your message remember the message of this hour was sent to you to come in and live in you to take you home the message of the hour is set brother braham said for the rapture of the bride for the going home of the bride amen amen see you find yourself you were already in him you were in the head then where's the rest of the body has to be manifest hallelujah all right so he said he said now i've come i come i low in the volume of the book it is written of me can you see your were you written we couldn't see that clearly it was a hidden thing but when that which is perfect has come we can see as he sees us amen that's why there's no fear the bride is not fearing what is it going to be we've already realized that we were already in him every seed is going to bring forth of its kind we are just a many member body a a varied member of himself a god of variety amen but it's all one headship it's all one word it's all one life flowing through the body all right so he said i come in the volume of the book to do thy will faith without works is dead i've come to do thy will but it's got to be revealed first amen it's got to be our our confession should be a confession of revelation hold fast the confession of your faith unmovable how can you say if it's not revealed to you then how do you know you truly believe it amen you're confessing what you believe and you wait for that because the just shall live by faith we aren't here just to press our own way and figure out our own way we have a perfect headship a perfect leadership now my subject consider your ways follow your head consider your ways and i'm speaking to every one of us that's me included consider our ways are we following the head what are we following have you given him headship satan is quick at trying to discourage you from giving yourself completely over to a total dependency upon god he will discourage you right and left he'll try to do everything he can to get you to look at who you're not instead of who god sees you are he'll point out your failures point at your faults and i can point back to him and said i never had a failure nor a fault because all my faults and failures were in a perfect body done away with by a perfect blood and we all have failures and faults but that's not what god's looking at amen he's looking at himself the message of the hours to unveil himself amen all right now he said so as the spirit of god he came down and created he said he heavenly bridegroom created his own bride as the spirit of god he came down and created in the virgin mary the cells from which his body was born i was in that creation i was right there in that creation when he came forth as a created word spoken word i was in him how can you be so sure because romans 8 11 said if the spirit that raised up jesus from the dead dwell in you it'll quicken your body sub bring it subject to the word he'll lead us in the word he'll reveal himself to us amen all right so he says when he created mary the cells in which his body was born i want to repeat that he created the very cells in the womb of mary for that body you were there in that creation i can just hear the red say what case case is dismissed they have the token life which i only see and i can't see their failures i can't see their mistakes i can't see any of these things because i and them will discern those failures and mistakes and they're quick to say yes lord i will not do that again forgive me if you need to go to someone else and ask forgiveness make it right that's the holy spirit in action and as long as you harbor that you'll become bitter you'll become on an island you'll be a turtle and a shell you'll have nothing to do with anybody else and we see that happening that's a cancer that's the devil's work amen so when i go to hear anything don't go like a turtle in your shell now said doesn't apply to me it applied to me and it applies to every one of us but i'm trying to point out and bring in your remembrance where your position is to try to show you before i really get down to my subject i want to show you here where you're called in who you were where you are and where you still are amen remind us of this that we may realize that we have a perfect headship a perfect leadership and we can depend on it perfectly and we don't have to figure out how it's working amen we don't have to go about and try to do works and all this we just simply say yes lord that word is your word you said when you put forth your sheep you went before them and the sheep followed you because they knew your voice is that right they know your voice and and they'll and they'll go in and out and find pasture and he'll put it forth to sheep i'm referring to saint john 10 verse 3 and when he put it forth as sheep he went before them and the sheep followed him you need a shepherd you cannot lead yourself somebody every day is leading you to do what you do the attitude you take the motives you take everything something is leading you and there's only two powers there's only two powers that's the power of the enemy which is perversion of the real truth and the power of god which is eternal life one of those is leading us in everything and oh god may we become so conscious of your presence and of your pr your presence in us and through us may our focus be not no longer blurred but focuses on one person christ in us christ where is this headship i'll get to that in just a moment you'll find where this headship is if you find where the headship is coming back to what we i i can't begin finish it because it's gone too far in between now but here it is love if we find where the headship is here in his love amen amen so the last adam of him it was said low a body has self-prepared for me god not mary provided that body mary was the human incubator she carried the holy child and brought him to birth it was a god man mary was a type of pentecostal organization went to organization see god poured out the spirit upon him and out of that pouring out he brought forth a bride that was right in that plant and they organized it became a shuck and it protected it until finally amen when the message began to begin realize the shuck had to pull away and identified itself to be a shock but where is what's beyond the shock the seed itself the wheat itself the son of man himself is revealed that's why we had to have that revealing to wake us up himself revealed amen how can we come to him unless he opens and unveils himself to us his purpose to us god's heart purpose what's god's heart purpose his central theme his central purpose was have a bride like unto himself that be himself made manifest amen he said i'll make it known i'll unveil it completely in the end and it'll be assignments at the end and we need not to play games anymore we need to recognize our leader we need to recognize our headship we need to give ourselves unconditionally unreservedly completely over and forget about your feelings and your emotions and what this one said and this one didn't say in something else and realize you have your focus on one headship and he will not lead you away from the word he'll lead you into the full truth of the word amen amen all right so he said he was of the he said he was a god man it was a god man you believe the bride the bride i'm not talking about the outer man she's outer man so was jesus are you with me but in that was his father my father worketh hitherto and i work because he knew who he was he followed that leadership my father worketh hitherto and i work i have that connection with my father and he said that same that same harmony that's got to exist between him and his bride amen it takes a lot of shaving down you're gonna go through sufferings and trials and heartaches and but it's all for a purpose god will not allow that to come upon your way except it be for a purpose to bring forth himself in revelation and reveal to you who you are that's what it's all about let him do his work he's not going to allow you to go through anything but what is good for you i'm talking to believers this morning i'm talking to christians i'm talking to bride amen amen he was the new creation man and god met and joined he was the new creation god man and god met and joined that settles it take that you devil you can't move me out of my position that's my position amen where was my position my position was in him right there in him there's where it was there's word finish i've never was in him and then left him i'm still in him because his spirit is in me identifying i was in him there is the rock that he would build his church on or is the revelation of what he would build his church on was a revelation of himself in you the baptism of the holy ghost is the new birth amen it opens up a new creation it reveals a new creation a spoken word creation how is he creating his sons and daughters the same method he always used by the word by spoken word and then the devil do everything he can to keep you away from feeding on the spoken word and it's season hallelujah and you can't receive who you are what you are unless you come through the interpretation of god's method and way through a profit vindicated profit and as you feed and as you feed i'm getting ahead of my scriptures but things begin to unveil to you and unveil what's the unveiling the unveiling of himself until you see that he's unveiled himself in a form it's not another person it's the manifestation and revelation of the son of man amen the son of man was revealing himself through a son of man amen are you with me and that's the that's the that's the carcass where the carcass is there the eagles are gathered together because what's the carcass not a man but the body word of the son of man amen there's where you're going to find the eagles there's first man is season there's where they grow and they can't grow into any other stature but himself there's your love there's the capstone they can't grow into any other way they have to grow up into him they receive the holy ghost it changed them just like abraham and sarah were changed they were changed so they could receive life they were changed because he said i'm going to return to you in the time of life and this isn't the time of life that we're still looking for a time of life this is the time of life this is where he come and the little bride's conceived and carrying in her the very thing that she'll meet in the air amen she's got to receive it he's got to have it sarah was looking they were looking for a promised son where'd it come through sarah amen are you with me you see your position what's my position now where am i seated i'm seated in heavenly places brother baron said that's the bride's position that you're positionally placed positionally placed in christ you are now seated in heavenly places in christ having received the same life in you as a token that you were in him already and you're not ashamed to let that be identified because your everyday living and life here is himself made manifest we ought to keep that in mind we're not here just to float around we're not here for any other purpose but to be the very manifestation of himself hallelujah that's a high calling and we're pressing toward the mark for the prize of that amen we're pressing toward the mark for the prize of that high calling there is a high calling we're in the midst of a high calling what are we we're as queen we're sovereignty under headship he's our king he's our headship we have one thing that's obey his word and i can't obey it in my own human self i have nothing in me to obey that like that but it takes the working of himself and me will keep me will hold me and he'll live out what i'm to here to live it's all in him it's all him so what are we doing what are we letting dominate our lives it's not him who is it if something come between you and i who is dominating when you brought us something else besides his leadership and his word he wants you spoke to you about and you just keep bowing to another thing what is it it's a spirit of idolatry and say you have it i'm saying that's what it is did you catch you did you follow me that's what it is i'm not saying you're idolaters i don't believe there's anybody if there is you need to repent and get right and get the holy ghost because the holy ghost don't point that out to you you've got a wrong ghost you got a wrong headship that's the truth i don't mean that to be funny that's exactly the truth because he made a promise if he's in you the leader he's also going to discern where you're going and what you are and who you are you don't have to sit down and trying to figure it out let go of your own thinking and your own humanness and give way and give over to him completely and a submission and surrender because any time you ball to something outside of his direct leadership it's a purp what it is is a spirit of fear amen i i know that was hard but that's exactly what it is may god open it to our heart our eyes to see and ears to hear amen because i've come written in this book and this little book was opened and hate and satan hates that book he has nothing when that's revealed in the bride and recognizing what she is and that she does the greater works she's an invincible army it's a complete rev that little book contained the complete revelation of christ complete revelation of jesus christ amen that's why i was that's why i was sealed back there that book of revelation was the revelation of jesus christ a little book brother branham said it was the bride book amen amen all right let's go to job 23 and so man and god met and joined he was the first of this new race i want you to notice he was the first of this new race what was this race god god manifested in flesh not another god was the lord was manifested in flesh and he was the beginning of that new race the beginning of the creation of god god creating himself in a in a body amen amen i pray that god will reveal to you that you were in him already that that's where your revelation lays it's all contained in him every bit of it's contained in him you are contained in him you live the life that you are meant to live in him god can't see you in any other way you are he is your identification he is your identification you are identified everything he did obeying the father's word was applied to you and you know that because when the holy spirit comes in you it doesn't vary it doesn't change it does the same thing moves you a direct shoe and guides you in the word amen in your portion in your parts to play in the body but that little spoonful is no different than chemicals in the whole ocean it's the same word amen did you follow me on that all right now i went instead of going to job job 23. you see if you see that then if you see what i'm trying to tell you you died with him you are already resurrected i didn't mean to have you swallow so hard but you're already resurrected it's just the body's got to catch up you've already got rapture you've already got rapture inside of you brother brahm said don't let that choke you he said you may not believe that let me say it again he said the rapture is already in you working you've already raptured he said everything you need for this journey including the rapture is in you now he said don't let that choke you he said you're already you've already got rapture in you now you've already raptured brother brown in fact he said what's coming forth in this hour is the rapturing bride coming forth amen you say all these are just cliche no they're more than cliches brother sister i won't accept that this is life this is the truth it's not something you just yeah we could sure we bring it through an avenue of our mental thinking but it's got to become a revelation and when it's a revelation it's your property there's nothing going to speak you out of it nothing to take you away from it you're sealed in them he's already revealed himself i'm sealed to the day of my redemption i've entered in i've entered in to his rest and i've ceased from my own labors you get a hold of that once you'll go out of here skipping a new tune you cease from your own labors now god's going to move you and he's going to do through he is going to act to you in unusual ways radical to your human thinking upside down to your human thinking unusual times unusual ways he's going to manifest himself he's going to fulfill his word because god is unusual he's not usual to our human thinking but this is where you know who you've met this is where you know that you know who's in you and where this headship is so he's creating many sons to himself how by the never failing method the word are you with me that's right all right aren't you glad you belonged to him this is the true revelation of god this was his purpose the purpose took form through election so guess what you never had any more to do with it than jacob did boy i thought somebody would have a shout at least amen do you see that he loved you i love jacob before jacob was even born for jacob did any works good or evil i wasn't basing what i my love upon his works is that right because jacob had the seed jacob alone was the seed jacob i loved he's myself he's me he's a shyster but he's me but god wasn't identifying himself under shysterism neither will he identify himself under emotionalism but he's identifying himself through the promised word for jacob amen in its season he come forth desiring that birth right above everything i've got to have it he didn't even know intellectually humanly know what he was even desiring until he met the newell until he met the god that gave it to him then he come out a changed man he come out a limping prince amen he with me he come out wrestled with god until he found out god i've been bucking against you all along lord from this time on what is your will what would you have me to do i'm dependent upon your leadership i'm dependent upon you to guide me i'm not going to question that i'm not going to question it at all because i know that i know you're in me and greater is he that is in you than anything could upset your way any way shape or form amen that's when you know amen that's right it's a knowing it's a revelation god chose that even from the very beginning what separated came from abel revelation the only difference brother brahm said that was the only difference so he probably made it he made a a stand right there and said i've never change that to my seed to my elect i will reveal my word and that's what i recognize i'll take care of it he'll bring you to you remember the bible said i'm bypassing these scriptures just to quote them out but i know my thoughts concerning you i say thank the lord i don't know my thoughts but he knows his my thoughts he already has my thoughts he already knows about me knows everything about me and he said i'm gonna give you i'm gonna i'm not they're not thoughts of evil they're thoughts of good his thoughts about me is not of evil but of good to give you and me an expected end what is my expected end keep your eye on the goal out here what is your expected end i'll be with him live in him have always lived in him and i'll have a body like him amen expect it in i'll bring you to it i'll bring you to it it's out of your works it's out of that but i reveal it to you and you're not ashamed to let go and let the revelation declare itself if i bowed to you and said oh i'm afraid of what the people are going to say then i then i have what have i done i've not followed my guide i've not followed my head amen i'm adding something to it i'm taking away listen brother sister his leadership is flawless his leadership over you is absolutely perfect flawless can't be added to can't be because you're absolute is his word your absolute is how god interpreted his word for the season you say well i think it means this what did he say through the one he interpreted it through i have a right to put our mind and our thinking to that if that's the case god didn't need to send us a message he had to make it known i the lord will do nothing until i first reveal my secrets through my servants the prophets and you were there to receive the secret hallelujah god won't change his way for you or nobody amen me or anybody no hallelujah if any man be in christ he is a new creation period amen so follow your head i said job 23 let's go there see if i can get some of these scriptures and come down here to my my what i want to bring out and get to amen i have to bypass some of this i will okay job 23 verse 10 but he knoweth the way that i take amen when he hath tried me i shall come forth as gold an expected end amen your my foot hath held his steps amen my foot has held his steps his way have i kept and not declined no matter how unusual no matter how radical no matter what david thinks about it my greatest enemy i've got is defeated do you realize you're fighting a defeated enemy greatest enemy of god's david who's yours where's this self this person of self that's what god that's what god says i've got to deliver you from till you're dependent on me not self not your ideas not your thinking if god asks you to do something quit you're radicalizing it and leaning to your own understanding well if that happens if this happens this will happen what will this do what will this think how will this be consider let us consider our ways i'll come into that scripture in a few moments here neither have i gone back from the commandment of his lips what did jesus say if you love me do what then you'll keep my word keep my command that shows love love will trust love will trust right down to the right into the very death grip it's right in he was faithful to the word unto death is that right faithful to him faithful to his calling faithful what are we if he was faithful god judges me faithful oh brother david how can you be i have the revelation of himself and me showing i was in him amen already that spirit that was in him is in me i see it working as it worked in him it's working in me i will lead you into all truth amen amen amen amen god has a perfect time he has a perfect way and a perfect season to reveal to you what he wants you to see you need to realize that and get over that impatience but to wait upon the lord and he said i say again wait upon the lord and begin to rejoice over his leadership and again i say rejoice and give him thanks in all things because what's happening to you is my will for you boy that's good leadership isn't that right what's the bible say he said giving thanks and all things for this is the will of god concerning you amen amen all right so he goes on job says but in but he is in one mind no in verse 12. neither have i gone back from the commandment of his lips i have esteemed the words of his mouth more than my necessary food money job wife family housing hunting fishing hello does he mean that much to you what does he mean to you is he your head or isn't he not your head then he has sovereignty to do what he wants to do with you any way he wants to at any time he wants to do with you as he did job what's that to you i'm going to come to that scripture it's going to have to hit us right where it right where it ought to be but it's light on our path if you don't have the light how do you know what's in air light expressed unveils expresses light doth make manifest darkness working of darkness something the devil is trying to hide didn't want you to catch he didn't want you to get the fact that you're the people of this book he didn't want you to get the fact that you're the message of that monk he doesn't want you to see that that you're the vision that he had of himself in full revelation he doesn't want you to see that you're the part of that vision you are the vision you are the message of the seventh angel you are what god wanted to do his heart purpose you're fulfilling that purpose i don't mean to scream at you but you have to understand god made me thus if i scream it doesn't mean i don't like you it means i love you i know he said yeah brother david yeah sure sure you do sure you do you'd be sweet and kind and mellow yeah john the baptist would have too you know and there's different ones in the bible that jesus wouldn't have looked on with anger okay but i choose to follow my head because his head's revealed to me and i know what i'm speaking is divine love for you if i didn't have that i need to be at this i need to be out somewhere and say god i will not take a substitute i will not accept nothing else but yourself if i can't if i can't manifest yourself through me if you if i can't have the real then i'm asking you to take my life and let me live no more here i will not be a make-believer i will not be one that's a a a hypocrite you say you prayed that absolutely many times and i meant what i prayed i don't want to be that lord if i can't genuinely manifest you under the promise of the word of this hour i don't want nothing to do with this i want you to take me and don't let me stand before you someday with just a mental conception of this message but he's in one mind and who can turn him and what his soul desires even that he doeth he got one mind concerning he knows the thoughts of you he's not going to change his thoughts of you i don't care how much you fumble and stall and fail you the real you in that soul is not a failure you're the word living you're born again you are the word living and in action you're god himself living boy i thought i'd get an amen out of that statement wow that's the truth that has nothing to do with david the flesh you've got to realize that there's a real you on the inside and there's a part of you that's not you there's two persons working in this body there's two natures brother branham said two persons amen that's what he said and the real use in the soul the part that's not of you and is against you is outer man amen that's right who's going to bring the outer man under obedience to the word the word going to bring it under obedience the word greater is he that is in you than he that is of the world you do not live in a born-again human body you live in a born-again word of god a birth word that's who you are that's why you can be happy and sad at the same time until you bring under obedience that's sad and make it happy hello amen you've got to recognize your authority in christ it's not it's not what you have it's what he's given you you now possess you now possess right now you now possessed perfect and given possessing and are given perfect headship amen perfect leadership oh but brother i just fumbled i stalled that wasn't him doing that there's no fumble and insulin in him there's no mistakes and and and and failures in him he lives through your mistakes and failures of this man you think that moves god out of his position does it move you out of yours you can't it can't because you know where you started you know where you were before the foundation of the world you know who you were who were you when the sons of god shouted for joy when i laid the foundations of the world and if you know who you are then you know if you know where you came from excuse me then you know who you are and if you know who you are then you know where you're going amen all right what's god asking for submission total submission of your own self self let go of self self is not your head boy i upset the apple cart on that one david is not my head david david is not who i have confidence in my ups and downs and my woohoos and this and that and failures and feelings and and the yielding to the devil and realize it was the devil anybody been there before you ever yielded to him and upset and almost said wait a minute that sneaky s yeah right serpent you're trying to get me on intellectual religion and i won't go there either this is himself or it isn't this is his life or it isn't this is who i am or not amen all right my my my where do i start here where do i start i haven't even started yet all right if you're a son of god or a daughter of god whatever you are when you receive the holy spirit then the holy spirit directs you to do things in yes you were already pre-planned to be here you think you had something to do with it you were pre-planned to be right where you are this morning seated right there and the thoughts of your mind he already knew about you can't hide it if you tried amen he's already proven that isn't he well i don't know about the break you haven't listened to enough tapes messages he's already proven that who'd we see manifested william branham or son of man right right who do we see manifested christ in bride form or humans then what are your what's your what's your motives what's your objectives what's your attitudes where are you going what you going for why are you living what you're living for i want god's way to be my way i don't care about the other things how much unreasonable it is to go god's way it's going to be unreasonable to your thinking to man's thinking guaranteed that are you willing do you know your head do you know that when you follow that everything works exactly right if you put him first these other things if you put the kingdom of god which is in you first these other things will be added unto you i just pray god encourage you in the way you should go and discourage you the way you should i pray for a lot of people in this assembly that way especially the ministry the care of this assembly i said god encourage us in the way we should go and discourage us in the way it isn't right that's exactly right it isn't about your position it's about anything it's about following the lord because every position of him is not little or big it's exactly himself in action amen all right he's going to direct it he's going to direct you on what you do amen the revelation of jesus christ personally to you is the new birth you were in him the son you were in him the son you know this by having the same spirit in you now as was in him you were in him you were in him you are the spirit you are the spirit of god in him when he became when he met melchizedek when abraham the seed of god met melchizedek you were in melchizedek and now i can say here today because i haven't entered my theophany body yet but i was in melchizedek i was already when he became manifest as word i was in that word thereby i know i have a body waiting i hope you caught that thereby i know i have a body waiting for me i was already in there and i can say today because i know where i'm more identified i say who is this melchizedek hello i hope that didn't go over your heads i hope you're catching your position david isn't melchizedek but the one i'm going to enter into is and i've already been identified in him because i've already heard from my theophany that theophany is eternal never did begin never did end and with that reality of knowing that i know that if the earthly tabernacle be dissolved i have one waiting amen amen amen talk about blessed assurance jesus is mine you don't realize what the token has given us amen you're here to portray the token you're here to live it and you don't have to try and work up and pump up try to live it it'll live itself automatically amen you don't have to pump it up and work it up you just need to let go and let god have his way all right let's see if i can get through this a little quicker i'd like to go to psalm 828 i mean psalm 18 28 and the bible brother paul or job said he performeth the thing that is appointed for me he performed with it i want to finish that scripture he said for he performeth the thing that is appointed for me did you catch that he and the bible said in psalms that he will perfect those things concerning me amen psalm 138 he will perfect that which concerneth me and my going out and coming in is all preserved amen it's already preserved i'll never leave you i'll never forsake you what do you have to fear nothing can come your way nothing can happen to you except i allow it what a perfect what a perfect union what a perfect relationship between a husband and his wife amen psalm 18. some of these i couldn't i didn't have enough markers to mark so i turned to them all right psalm 18 28 for thou will light my candle the lord my god will enlighten my darkness for by thee have i have i run through a troop and by my god have i leaped over a wall as for the for god his way is perfect amen the word of the lord is tried amen the word of the lord is tried he is a buckler to all those that trust in him in him for who is god save the lord or who is a rock revelation save our god it is god that girdeth me with strength and maketh my way im perfect did i say something wrong i just added two letters he's made my way perfect not imperfect but perfect amen amen amen that's just how slight the devil is just change it a little bit oh you're not perfect it just depends on what side of the body you're talking about and what side you you want to deal with inside i'm as perfect as god is outer man depends on god totally comple well inside too but i'm saying it's imperfect so if you're looking perfection for david just come right down and say well bless god i'm perfect no i beg your pardon you're looking at the wrong person but if i speak through faith i am perfect all right now saint john john 10 3 i already mentioned to you isaiah 30 21. i say i've got to hurry i don't like to hurry you know i don't like to hurry anybody say amen paul you can use that one if you want all right isaiah 30. in fact you can be redundant with if you want okay isaiah 30 and verse 21 leadership and thine eyes there excuse me thine ears shall hear a word behind thee behind thee behind thee or inside of thee thy ear shall hear a word behind thee saying this is the way walk you in it and you know it sounded like a great big huge voice like lightning and thunder no no it's a still small voice but you know it because they know my voice and a stranger they'll not follow you know you have to be trained to learn to hear his voice it's there but you got to be trained you have to be trained just like a child has to be trained to one voice you have to be trained god trains us to hear that voice and none other and when you hear that voice and realize you're an absolute weakling and when you realize that you'll give yourself over to that one that's strong you'll give yourself to your strength my strength doesn't lay in david my strength is in him he's my strength all right then if i know that then i'm going to surrender to the strength why should i follow a weakling amen i'm following my strength that's right that's right all right now so you're going to hear that behind you saying this is the way walk you in it when you turn you're gonna have turns you're gonna have things change when you turn to the right hand and when you turn to the left god will say i want you to forsake that what are you gonna do turn it or not and you know it's god talking to you i want you to forsake that but lord but don't add your reasoning to it don't put your imagination on it forget about what people are going to think about you forget about all the works you did in building your great altar and all your fine works to produce it where you are forget about all of that and follow me oh that's too radical that's too out of my reason you know god expects us to reason he does as long as he agrees with the word are you with me all right okay okay i'm just going to skip through these i got to get to a point here you bear with me psalm 16 7 do as david did brother brown said he said put your let's just turn there we're right in in near psalms here just turn over to psalm 16. [Music] my wife what he gets after he said it's not psalms i guess it is psalms but it's psalm 16. i mean the bible does say the whole book is psalms but it's psalm 16. i don't have to be bothered with that anymore she corrected me a long time ago on that i learned my lesson i'm thankful for a good wife hey i'm not i mean that she's the other part of me amen i thought some brothers are the same men i'm not complete without her amen she was my eternal mate she is my eternal mate i believe we were meant to be together from eternity that was a revelation in my heart when i married her now we know your secret of being married 51 years yeah that's right and it'd be 151 if time went on amen i love her that much i'm not saying that hope to get a good meal when i get home now no no i would say if anyone at any time at any place she's a sweetheart i don't know how she thinks about me as being a husband but well yes i do i can't say that truthfully let me let you a little secret we have a love affair now don't you get the wrong thought about that she's one with me it is a love affair and we ought to have a love affair with god in fact we ought to be in so loved with god lord just your nod is all i need this is what i want you to do yes lord i'll go anywhere you want me to i'll go any place you want me to at any time you want me to and nothing else is then in my way when you say go amen that's exactly what it has to be otherwise you've got something else that's taking predominance preeminency all right now so psalm 16 7 says i will bless the lord who have given me counsel my reigns also shall instruct me in the night season i have set the lord always before me there's what you have to do right there daily we die daily to ourself i have set the lord always before me for because he's on he's at my right hand what's your right hand power and authority where's your power and authority lay see it's in him the word it's inside the headship is inside we're coming to that in just a moment he said he said therefore he said i have set the lord always before me because he is on my right hand i shall not be moved therefore my my heart is glad and my glory rejoices and my flesh also shall rest in hope you say brother david that was speaking of christ at calvary yes it is but it also applies to me whatever applies to him applies to me did you know that the same word brother brahm said written in the scriptures concerning him concerning you did you know that that's what he said that's exactly right you're in the volume of the book amen all right let's see here proverbs 3 4 says lean not to your own understanding but in all thy ways acknowledge him and he shall direct thy path thy paths right hand left hand when you turn to the right or to the left this is the way walk in it all right now second corinthians 4 18 said we should not look at the things which are seen they're temporal but look at the things that are not seen that's eternal so lord sharpen our focus to see what we should see psalm philippians 2 13 said that it's god which worketh in me god which worketh in you born again god working in you both to will and to do to will and do i don't know how you get any better than that to will and do his good pleasure brother i said what do we have to do let him he's in there you let him you say what authority do i have let him a wife lets her husband have headship over her well that's a whole message itself i preached that before but you want to know what the key is on his shoulders he opens and shuts no other one you want to know that he's got responsibility over you you've given it to him he's obligated he accepts the obligation of absolutely having right to do what he wants with you and through you because the bible said today with this open word it's god it's jesus christ working in and through his bride he didn't finish some works he had to do but now he does it in and through the bride to finish to complete his works he works in and through the bride that's in the mess you pick up your pen and write if you want to pick it up that's what he that wasn't brother brown's thoughts people want to say well that's just his thoughts well i'll have you know pick up your pen and write wasn't his thoughts that was god writing through his pen amen all right zechariah 4 6 not by power nor by by might or my power but by my spirit saith the lord amen therefore if we know that is god working in us both to will and to do of his good pleasure then quit your murmuring that's what the bible said that's the next verse verse 14 then let us not murmur let's go to philippians there real quick and just point that out to you philippians 2 verse 13 14 then do all things without murmurings and disputings amen do all things without murmurings and disputings for it is god verse 13 which worketh in you both to will and to do of his good pleasure do all things without murmurings and disputings what do you have to murmur about what do you have dispute about i'll jump to verse 16. holding forth the word of life that i'm holding forth it's like we said to david put him before you holding forth the word of life this is my guide this is my absolute and i have no other absolute this is what he said this is what he meant i'm going to take that i'm going to take him at his word lord i'll let down the net at thy word lord mayest help us to walk that way at thy word you know what you're absolute because you can't add to or take from it you know what you're absolute because heavens and earth will pass away but thy word won't so what other absolute do you have you've got to have an absolute either absolute's going to be yourself your own self motivation what you think is better than god's word or it's going to be god's word or it's going to be the message of the hour which is god's word amen all right proverbs 4 18. i'm going over these real quick because i want to get to a port you're going to have to just put with me just a little bit here and i i've got to get this out i can't make part 2. proverbs proverbs chapter 4. proverbs chapter 4 and verse 18. but the path of the just is as the shining light that shineth more and more unto the perfect day i want you to notice the path of the just is as a shining light this is the message god is light amen thy light has come bride thy light has come this is the path of justice shining light that shineth more and more unto the perfect day not less and less more and more the way of the wicked is his darkness he knoweth not at what he stopped they stumble it's darkness you go to isaiah 60 to read that my son attend to my words incline thy ear unto my sayings let them not depart from thine eyes keep them in the midst of thine heart for they are life unto those that find them and health to all their flesh keep not keep thy heart with all diligence for out of it are the issues of life and what do you what the patients do in patients possessing your soul all right put away from thee a forward mouth and perverse lips far put far from thee let thine eyes look right on and let thy eyelids look straight before the other words keep your eye on the goal and stay steady don't look at what's around you don't look at this church is going off don't look at these people that over here saying this and saying that and the church is going off into wickedness you keep your eye on the goal and you stay steady at his word and you'll ride that board i don't care how thin it is to the end as long as you get your eye over here and your eyes are in the devil's good at trying to get you that way too and don't tell me there's not one of us that's not subject to that absolutely every one of us are battling every day a hot battle against our enemy and the enemy's trying to use the enemy that's right because all he can feed on is flesh all his meat is is dust we have something much higher than that i hope you know that amen we have fresh manna fresh food every day you ought to be feeding on it every day you ought to be taking time redeeming the time but you're not putting time for it then you're letting something else come in what are you putting ahead of the word what are you putting between you and god it's straight i know it's straight but it applies to me and both all of us what are we doing what are we listening to what voice are we hearing but i'm going to tell you one thing if you're a true child of god the seed of god you're going to hear the voice of god and you won't you you won't question it the devil questioned it but that inside of the inside will not question that word that seed will not deny itself all right lord help me to get this finished verse 20 5 verse yep verse 26 ponder the path of thy feet and let all thy ways be established turn not to the right hand nor to the left remove thy foot from evil i say lord you guide me if i should start to even move off just get a little out of step those at the end when he saw the bride marching a little out of step they weren't in the beginning they were at the end a little bit out of step get in line stay in line consider your ways now i'm going to go to my subject no i want to cover one more thing here my subject won't be too long because i built up to this look at this now i'm going to bypass some things here we know that the rapturing bride is coming out of those denominations out of that shuck it's the rapturing bride coming forth from there the seed the word made manifest again that's his own that's that's your word that's your father's word to you all right you must obtain the message today in your heart and lay in the presence of the sun to be ripened you've got to allow yourself to be ripened the wheat has got to get ripe amen he's making matured christians see what i mean god is coming soon to receive his church and we must be that type of christian for him to receive the wheat has to get ripe and listen we're far beyond what he's when he said that i believe you're seeing the weed of the golden brown you know brother david there just isn't very many i don't care how many there is the point is there is it's not how many god doesn't look in the mini he looks at those he ordained i don't know who that is it's none of my business i just preached the truth i'm not here to judge anybody by that but by their fruit they are known what is the fruit what did brother bam say the fruit was the word for the season the message of the season you're able to hear it you're able to receive it you're able to live it there's only one life that god will accept amen a life worthy of the gospel there's only one life and that's his own you can't have a feel good about the feel good feeling about this message and make it to heaven make it in the rapture you've got to have absolutely an unveiling of the word in you that's christ in you christ in you is god's great revelation that's his purpose right there i'll leave that late there's a lot of things here that i just hit the tops of amen but you're led by the control room the control tower you're controlled by the tower on the inside of you brother brahm said that's the soul the person in there is pulling the levers making the buttons work and everything he's controlling whoever in your soul is who you are amen that's it there's where you've got to know it's a knowing i know him to know him is life amen you've got to hold to that little wheel in the middle of the wheel and let it stabilize every move and every motion you make every thought that you have may it be controlled by this tower on the inside of you because god is setting right in his word of this hour that's you he's sitting right in the word of his hour of this hour in the evening light showing forth the light amen that's right it's what he is and when you can master and god give you grace to master your human ability god doesn't need your human ability like i said the rest of the afternoon talking about perfect strength and perfect weakness amen the only thing you can do to beat the devil is rely on christ and humbly humble yourself humble yourself humble your self and let him lead you see you'll never do it any other way your intellectual powers will never do it just rely on him he's the shepherd it ain't the sheep's business to keep the wolf away it's the shepherd's business but the sheep must stay with the shepherd in order to stay safe that's my safety zone is in christ in christ in christ and christ is the word that's the safety zone you have to know him as the person christ in you your redemption is a person and the revelation of that person in you identifies you're redeemed he come to redeem his thoughts of himself that's what he come to redeem amen there it is all right the way up is down always be conscious of how little you are the way up is down he that humbles himself shall be exalted he that exalts himself should be a base amen he said he said because you have the way up is down always he said see how humble you can get just away from your own worldly thinking humble yourself before god then you've got more power than the man that runs all over the building and makes a big lot of noise see because you have been able to conquer yourself and commit yourself to christ you see humble yourself and commit yourself to christ that shows true humility when you commit yourself fully into his hands even every word you speak even every breath you take even every beat of your heart every fiber of your being commit it to him amen that's really power when you humble yourself before him i say god let me have your humbleness let me have your humility amen to where david isn't seen christ is seen yourself in the sight of the lord and he shall lift you up humble yourselves therefore unto the mighty hand of god that may exalt you in due time casting all your care upon him you know what care is anxiety casting all your anxiety upon him for he careth for you amen amen all right i'd like you to turn with me the book of haggai and i'll try to just quit this in about five ten minutes is all the further i'm going to take i know i've taken your time but we're only going to go out and eat lunch and fill the fat this is better food than that amen i'm telling you we need more than of this than that oh but you just don't know how i feel forget about your feelings the devil can twist you around the pole with your feelings amen amen we should be grown up more than that yeah you say i didn't like that brother david well that's all right pray for me all right haggy i won i thought i had that marked oh maybe i do yeah okay okay now listen carefully i'm coming down to the end right here up here in just a little bit verse 2 thus speaketh the lord of hosts saying i want you to know who's speaking thus speaketh the lord if i believe this is very pertinent for right now today i believe the word of god does that i'd be saying well that would back and haggy thousands of years ago no it's right here today i want you to look at the scriptures being here now thus speaketh the lord of hosts this people say the time has not come the time that the lord's house should be built now you know who the lord's house is the lord's house is your his house my house is christ amen this is where i dwell in a temporary dwelling but my house where my inhabitation is is my theophany hello you tell me how you tell me how an a virus or anything else is going to touch it oh touch this if god wills it but he has to will it because this is his house how many know he's going to change it and raise it up again that's right promised it didn't he remember resurrection isn't replacement if this goes in the dust it's not something else that takes its place but sin won't rise again so a body is going to raise it'll be me but it won't be sin in it it'll be a young man just exactly what god had in his thought to begin with all right now let's start dude i don't want to get sidetracked on this then came remember the lord's how the time is that the lord's house should be built what's the lord's house his body how's it going to be built by the word god builds his body by the word all right you've got to let him build the body all right then came the word of the lord to haggai the prophet saying is it time for you o ye to dwell in your sealed houses and this house lie waste i'm pausing because i want this to go deep this is for you this is for us this morning every one of us and we're talking about the body of christ assembled here in this house amen all right the people say the time is not no excuse me it is it time for you oh ye to dwell in your sealed houses every one of us got good houses i don't know of anybody here that's a pauper and not living in a nice home thank god for it i'm not i'm not against that thank god he's blessed us abundantly i'm poor yet i'm very blessed we should never be afraid to be poor because prophet said we're all poor that's right all right but we're poor or poor in the world's thinking in the world's what money doesn't make you rich or poor amen that's just that's just man's interpretation okay now it's time for you oh ye is it time for you to dwell in your seal houses in this house lie waste now therefore thus saith the lord of hosts consider your ways you have sown much and bring in little you eat but you have not enough you drink but you're not filled with drink you you clothe you but there is none warm and ye that earneth wages earneth wages to put in a bag with holes thus saith the lord of hosts consider your ways i pray that god will drop this into every individual here from the pastor to the youngest child and every one of them in between that all of us the ministry especially me will realize what we're here for amen consider your ways go up to the mountain and bring wood and build a house and i will take pleasure in it and i will be glorified saith the lord you look for much and lo it came to little and when you brought it home i did blow upon it why saith the lord because my house is that is waste and you run every man unto his own house that's potent let me read that scripture again i'm talking about leadership here there's something there's something amiss here when god will not allow his house to lie waste i'm not saying it's waste but you've got to recognize what are the elders here for what is the ministry here for what are you here for why have you associated yourself in here let's do everything we can in one mind and what accord to give attention to the lord's leadership and what he's saying here amen we must make this house under the headship of the work not your feeling it must come under the headship of the word not the woman i'm talking about denominationalism dominating female but of the headship of the word it's the ministry it's the pastor it's the deacons it's the trustees to bring everything under the headship of the word amen and let this place prosper as a lighthouse but what we got to do consider our ways consider what the prophet said about it consider what the word said about it it's not just some whim it's thus saith the lord he said because of mine house that is waste and every man run into his own house therefore you put your house above the other house amen we all have these things we all meet it every day i'm telling you this struck me right between the eyes i said i had to go and repent and repented many times lord i am here for one thing and that's to raise up your word i don't care where i am we have a duty here to god we have we have been we have not only we have a duty to the people we have a duty to god to serve our purpose where he's got you and do it according to the word you have no right to preach i say yes i have every right to preach that amen i'm a minister of this gospel amen and god definitely i've had to show you our leadership our headship let me just read this to you right here i was going to hit it i told you i'd hit it let me just get this to you our headship is a kingdom our headship is a kingdom we're not we're predestinated of him we've come from the same source he came from i think i made that very clear but he said then our headship is a kingdom the kingdom of god is within you said the bible the kingdom we are not a denomination we belong to a kingdom the kingdom is the word of god made spirit and life in our own life bringing every to pass every promise of this day as it did in the day when the word and god was won and the word and god is one in his church today making it the headship of the body that is redeemed to bring the message the headship of the body that is redeemed to bring the message amen i wish i could stress that the way know what amen redeemed to bring the message what is the bride what is she she's the final voice the bride is to be the father messenger is the final voice the final trump amen where is that voice where is it today it's in the bride what is it by coming of christ son of man revealed before us we shouldn't take that lightly we should recognize where he's at it was so simple though many it passed right through except the bride and she's the only one it could only be revealed to her i'm talking to bride i'm talking to ones that can receive the word we need to make sure make sure you're following him you'd have little women just a little feeling well i feel you better make sure it's with according with the word brother abraham said you make sure it's him and when you're sure it's him then you press yourself right on through amen god's obligated to make sure it's the truth he's the discerner he's obligated to discern in you to discern the truth from error amen and the word and god is one in his church today making it the headship of the body that is redeemed to bring the message of the last day and be taken up from the dead in the resurrection go back and restore again as adam and eve in the beginning in the garden of eden the threefold mystery of god his body oh my god's perfected in what three what's our next step what's his third coming what's his coming now we come back to the earth in a millennium but the mystery of his coming is happening think of that how where we ought to be standing today we shouldn't have to be shoved and pushed into anything we should recognize the word as our head and our absolute and be up and doing it not looking to your own selfish motives and objectives in your own self and putting that over the needs of the body amen i'm guilty you're guilty every one of us are guilty but it's time we consider our ways you are his kingdom you are his eternal possession as i said david is not my head it's christ alone he you in your soul birth is my head amen okay i want to finish this excuse me getting a little bit sidetracked there almost sidetracked exactly verse 10 therefore the therefore the heaven over you has stayed from dew and the earth has stayed from her fruit because my house lies that is waste what was he telling him go back and rebuild the house i'm here for you to come back and do your position that i've called you to do this is my ordained leadership go build the house but all but i but but but make excuses remember how jesus brought the excuses this one brought an excuse i've got to go visit this i've got a i've got a cow in the ditch or whatever it was i forget what it was go back i got to bury someone let the bird dead bury the dead i've got i gotta excuse excuse excuses it's your own selfish motives if god's calling you to do something individually and i don't know what he is or isn't but what he is you have one thing to do give yourself to it but it's painful brother david yeah it's painful it may be painful it may be contrary to your will but you have to do it anyway if god's called you to do it a double-minded man is unstable in his ways unstable why because his interest is divided he's divided in interest he's he's trying to live between the two realms this the soul realm and the physical realm trying to live between two realms and god's saying but this is the way walking in it i've asked you to give yourself i've asked you to give yourself a hundred percent to this body to the and you're afraid of doing it because you're afraid of what will happen i'm talking this seems like a little bit vague but i am doing that for a purpose trusting the lord to quicken it to you individually what he's speaking to you now watch what he said here then it's a rubbable verse 12 the son of sheltiel and joshua the son of josedec the high priest with all the remnant of the people obeyed the voice of the lord their god and the words of haggy i the prophet as the lord their god had sent him and the people did fear before the lord that's the right attitude then spake haggai the lord's messenger amen then spake haggai i the lord's messenger in the lord's message then spake haggai the prophet messen the messenger in the lord's message he said unto the people saying i am with you saith the lord do you realize what he's telling you i am with you just act upon what i've asked you to do and don't fear the consequences that the devil is wanting to build up as a mountain before you he's asking give us our whole self to it like the rich young ruler that rich young businessman brother brown called him that he's speaking to the businessman's conventions rich young ruler he said yeah he said but there's one thing they'll lack us even the lord loved him but you're lacking one thing you've got your eyes on your money you've got your eyes in your business and you're not willing to give it up but i'm calling and you asked me about eternal life but he refused to follow the leadership of the person of eternal life christ don't let us come to that place let us consider and i'm including myself brother sis you have to realize not pointing anybody i'm pointing myself consider your ways i'm speaking to everybody in here what's your motive and objective for doing what you're doing is the is the word have the headship over the whole thing is it for the word headship is it for that or is it for self or is it for something else i'm gonna finish with the scripture here but let me just read on further and so and then the lord stirred up the spirit of jezebel urged because jerubal stirred him up the message ought to stir us up it ought to get us to consider ourselves we ought to go to prayer and then say lord show me what am i am i doing you search me lord search me see if there be anything in me that is standing before your way and what you will for me to do that'll be our prayer that would be exactly a desperate call to god because i'm telling you the devil is a tricker you'll lay a snare every way you can he'll get you to believe something it's not the truth he'll get you to reason it out he'll get you to reason it forth amen and reason why you can't do what the lord's called you to do and give yourself over to it completely so that so that it may prosper i want you to stay where he's called you to stay absolutely right but god is not an author of confusion amen amen if he called you to be a certain sort of thing then give your whole self to it and let him lead you in that if he called you over this is something else let him lead you in that don't try to mix the two it don't mix don't try to mix the word with your own ideas your own feelings and your own senses and your imagination don't you add to it or take from it you just go back to god and say you say well i don't know if i agree with you brother david you don't have to agree with me but the one thing i am asking you to do is go before the lord and say lord what is that your will what you would you have searched me search me and let him search you then stand up say lord i believe what you've said to me no matter what my wife husband thinks this job that job some other job or whatever it is maybe if i'm to do a job that i'll do the best i very best i can then you've called me to that if you called me to another job and to take care of it let me get in my place because we need to come to that place of complete unity and dependency and complete submission to the word of god for the house of god to prosper and i'm not saying everybody's going to believe the same thing it won't but i'm telling you every position every born-again christian everyone that's born of the spirit of god every elect seed has got to come to that position where you have one focus not a blurred focus one focus i will do your bidding lord i don't care where you use me where you send me i'll give everything i can to that call and you mean it i don't care what you think about it or what i think about it or anybody else thinks about it consider our ways and the spirit of joshua son of jose deck the high priest and they and and and uh and the spirit of all the remnant of the people and they came and did the work in the house of the lord of hosts their god there you are now the word of god would prosper now the house will be built and you'll see the works of god manifest amen we're not looking for prosperity and money to flow in and numbers and numbers no it may go the other way less and less but it'll prosper spiritually if we let it go undone then what is it is it the house that's left undone because we got other things we're trying to divide ourselves with i speak to myself i have to deal with this you have to too are we going to follow our perfect headship which is a kingdom in you the word in you is your kinship i'm just going to get this off my heart i just told you it's going to be a little scratchy but that's the truth you do with it as you will to do and i want you to follow the lord's will i'm not asking you to follow a man's will follow his will but i pray god if you are build fulfill the holy ghost you're going to have a sensitivity of what spirit around you is trying to influence you i guarantee it you're not going to come under a false spirit you're going to recognize that spirit and what it's doing and what are you going to do there's got to be raising a standard the holy ghost himself will raise a standard against it amen okay i know i'm taking time and i'm just about done verse 3 of chapter 2 says who is among you that saw the house in her first glory who who was it among you that seen jesus christ in her first glory and see it repeated again today have we come to that again see we didn't see that in his first but a prophet told us and let us look through his eyes and saw that bride marching the first and saw the same one come back again is that right saw her in her first glory and when she come to the in her time at this time we saw her in her glory again what is the bride's glory himself christ himself amen yet now be strong those rubble verse 4 saith the lord and stronghold joshua son of jose deck the high priest be strong although you people of the land saith the lord and work for i am with you saith the lord of hosts that ought to be enough amen amen now just look at the scripture here real fast if i want to go there or not i don't remember said a double-minded man is unstable in his ways don't let that man think he's going to receive anything of the lord see he's uncertain of his position your focus is divided your vision is blurred your eye is not single it's not we're not de-christianizing anybody i'm just saying don't let it become blurred god refocus let our focus be single and then you follow what the lord shows you to do and don't you give way to nothing else amen because then everyone is in their position in the body then you'll see the body of christ which is the house of god prosper amen amen there's not going to be a confusion don't be a confusion spirit something is not right when there's that confusion god is not the author of that everyone in their position doing exactly what the lord showed them to do and given themselves to it well you make mistakes yes but the mistakes will be identified and corrected and you'll answer to that and quicken and i say answer me you mean you respond to it the correction then you'll see a house then you'll see a christ then you'll see things moving amen and sin can't even come back to the door except it be uncovered that's right amen you want to see god act that way i'm not sure i want to come to a church like that well then that's your choice but light when it's preached is going to uncover wrong and when you walk in the light as he is in the light it's a glorious liberty for where the spirit of the lord is there's liberty he told peter even though peter casts out devils and and and he'll cast out devils and everything before he was converted amen don't take that as your evidence amen but i'll say it on the other hand if he could do that under a non-conversion what do we ought to do under conversion is that right we have a word that's nigh even in thy mouth what is that word that's not even in the mouth the word of faith amen and you know when that faith is spoken it's not your faith it's god's faith and heavens and earth will pass away but that has to happen it's because it's not your makeup your idea and you're impressed it's absolutely the revealing of the word himself in your mouth and you speak it god reveals this thought and is still a thought until you speak it and it's got to happen that's the church of the living god okay let's go to let's go to saint john 21 22. i'll probably try to close in here thank you for your patience i really appreciate it i've taken a lot of time here that you have to forgive me i know you will because i know you love me where was i here psalm okay i was gonna look up something okay i want to go to saint john but just a moment i wonder if i want to read this or not take the time yeah verse 8 27 8 of psalms says when thou said a seek my face my heart said unto thee thy face lord will i seek there you are hide not thy face far from me and and let i'm putting out thy servant away in anger thou hast been my help leave me not neither forsake me o god my salvation when my father and mother forsake me then the lord will take me up teach me thy way oh lord and lead me in a plain path because of mine enemies deliver me not over to the will of mine enemies for false witnesses are risen up against me and such as breathe out curate i had fainted lest i had believed to see the goodness of the lord in the land of the living wait on the lord be of good courage and he shall strengthen thine heart wait i say on the lord amen john you're the only one that's going to answer this question but i'm going to leave it with you and we could spend some time on it that guy's going to spend a whole message on it but i think we'll just end it right here it's john 20 20 john 21 22. jesus and this is peter here peter let me just i don't mean 22. i'm sorry where did i read here no no i want i want verse 15. excuse me saint john i'll come to 22. but saint john 21 15. so when they had dined this is at the at the lake they said cast their head on the other side they realized it was christ speaking because peter was kind of discouraged he said well he said i guess it's over with i think i'll go back fishing you know one time he did follow jesus and gave up his fishing and
