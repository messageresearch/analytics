[26:16] hardly
[26:17] a place
[26:19] for a king to be
[26:22] born he didn't choose someplace special
[26:28] to reveal his majesty
[26:32] so i know if i
[26:34] give him control
[26:37] he'll be born in me
[26:41] let
[26:42] your
[26:44] word be born
[26:47] in the manger of my heart

[27:04] and mold it every day
[27:09] let your word be born
[27:12] in the manger
[27:15] of my heart
[27:29] unlikely the place
[27:33] for his word to unfold
[27:37] but if i'll just yield this vessel
[27:41] and let him have his way
[27:45] from glory unto glory
[27:49] he'll change me day by day

[33:14] before we read the scriptures
[33:16] our heavenly father
[33:18] as we open the word we can do that
[33:20] physically but lord it takes you
[33:23] to unveil to us
[33:26] what you have already
[33:28] interpreted to us through your profit
[33:31] it wasn't the prophet interpreting
[33:33] anything
[33:34] but it was you working through that
[33:36] prophet interpreting your word and now
[33:38] we see the word being manifested
[33:41] and it is catching away
[33:43] a bride
[33:46] we thank you for this reality lord for
[33:48] the word is not just a letter to us now

[33:54] it's just not a letter anymore it's
[33:56] revelation it's life
[33:58] it's reality
[34:00] we're becoming one as you pour yourself
[34:03] into us
[34:04] as we feed on the opened word
[34:07] you pour yourself into us we are
[34:09] becoming one
[34:11] for the wedding supper
[34:13] what a great reality of life lord what a
[34:15] great reality of eternal life
[34:19] and i'm thankful lord that we
[34:21] have that revelation our victory
[34:24] we give you praise may you open the word
[34:27] to us and unveil it to us as you have
[34:29] desired
[34:30] and have already purposed to do lord we
[34:34] submit ourselves to you knowing as man
[34:36] we have no ability but our ability and
[34:39] our confidence doesn't lay in the flesh
[34:42] it lays in the unveiled word in us
[34:45] we thank you for this lord we give you
[34:48] praise for we have your name and
[34:49] therefore it's in that name we pray the
[34:52] lord jesus christ

[35:15] sake
[35:17] lead me
[35:18] and guide me
[35:19] psalm 62
[35:26] verse 6
[35:27] and 7. very similar he only
[35:31] is my rock brother branham if you recall
[35:34] in the message shalom both messages
[35:37] preached in phoenix and the other
[35:38] preached in sierra vista i think it was
[35:41] shalom
[35:43] he says rock in the scripture
[35:45] means revelation
[35:48] so he is my revelation
[35:53] he is my revelation
[35:56] and my salvation
[35:58] hallelujah
[35:59] he is my defense
[36:01] i shall not be moved
[36:04] in god is my salvation
[36:08] and my glory
[36:10] the rock of my strength the revelation
[36:14] of my strength
[36:16] and the my refuge
[36:18] is in god
[36:21] let's just take verse 8 with it trust in
[36:24] him that's
[36:25] faith
[36:26] trust
[36:27] revel trust in him at all times
[36:32] ye people
[36:34] after we read what we read right here in
[36:36] these first verses before that we
[36:38] certainly can realize
[36:40] if it's revealed to you
[36:42] at all times ye people pour out your
[36:45] heart before him god is a refuge for us
[36:49] sila
[36:51] you can be seated turn to first john 5.
[36:55] and i'll i'll bring in the rest of this
[36:57] subject
[36:59] and in hebrews 11 1 the two verses i'll
[37:02] be going to here first john 5
[37:05] 1
[37:06] through 5.
[37:15] whosoever believeth
[37:19] whosoever
[37:20] believeth that jesus is not was
[37:26] although he was
[37:28] but jesus is we're looking at present
[37:31] tense
[37:32] right now this night
[37:34] right here that jesus is
[37:37] the christ
[37:39] is born of god
[37:42] how can you say that jesus is lord or
[37:45] christ to you without the new birth
[37:48] you don't know it you may have an
[37:49] intellectual knowledge of it
[37:52] but you cannot have the revelation of it
[37:54] in you until he steps in and quickens
[37:57] that seed and brings dynamics to that
[37:59] word placed in your heart
[38:02] and quickens that word and reveals
[38:04] himself
[38:06] then you can say jesus is the christ
[38:09] jesus is the son of
[38:13] is the christ
[38:14] is born of god and everyone that loveth
[38:17] him that begat loveth him also
[38:20] that is begotten of him
[38:23] by this we know not imagine by this we
[38:26] know that we love the children of god
[38:29] when we love god and keep his
[38:31] commandments
[38:34] for whosoever is born of god that's why
[38:37] it said that song see
[38:39] for whosoever is born of god
[38:42] what is the new birth again it's jesus
[38:44] christ
[38:47] birth in you
[38:48] the seed had to be there

[38:53] baptism of the holy ghost is the new
[38:55] birth

[39:04] is the love of god no by this we know we
[39:07] love the children of god and when we
[39:09] love god
[39:11] and keep his commandments
[39:16] for this
[39:17] is the love of god that we keep his
[39:19] commandments and his commandments are
[39:21] not grievous

[39:31] christ is born of god verse 4 for
[39:34] whatsoever is born of god

[39:58] feeling a nice hope a nice thought it is
[40:02] the person amen
[40:04] of christ in you

[40:13] that does his works
[40:16] so whatsoever whosoever whatsoever
[40:19] is born of god
[40:21] overcometh the world
[40:24] and this is
[40:26] the victory
[40:28] that overcometh the world even our
[40:32] faith
[40:34] our faith is what the victory that
[40:38] overcometh the world
[40:40] what is our faith revelation of who we
[40:44] are
[40:47] amen
[40:49] our rock
[40:50] who is my rock god is my rock
[40:55] who is my fortress
[40:57] and my rock
[41:00] who is my revelation
[41:02] who is your revelation
[41:05] who's revealed in you
[41:07] it's not what you learn
[41:10] amen it's what you have
[41:13] given you
[41:14] by the grace and sovereignty of god
[41:17] identifying of the identifying of your
[41:21] faith being his own faith
[41:26] amen
[41:28] amen you have to have the identification
[41:31] the token is our identification
[41:34] the life in the blood
[41:36] and it can't be on display unless it's
[41:38] in you revealed
[41:42] and you can't have that revealed in you
[41:44] unless the seed laying there that god
[41:45] had to place there
[41:49] amen and if he placed it there then you
[41:51] were existing in his thoughts before the
[41:53] foundation of the world
[41:56] amen is that right you were existing in
[41:59] his thoughts you were the thought of
[42:00] himself we read this on on the sunday
[42:03] the fifth i won't go into all that so
[42:04] much but when jesus christ the logos was
[42:08] manifested in flesh god the son
[42:11] you were right there in him he became
[42:13] the word living word you are right there
[42:16] in him living
[42:18] and here you are today you were in him
[42:20] then and here you are now
[42:23] the living word why showing because you
[42:26] came in him you died with him you raised
[42:28] with him and you are his victory
[42:33] amen
[42:34] amen you are his victory you have
[42:36] victory
[42:39] not going to get it you got it
[42:42] you just catch the revelation of this
[42:44] that that
[42:46] you're the expression of himself you're
[42:48] the very decreed word that had to be
[42:50] spoken in this hour spoke you into
[42:53] manifestation existence you are a spoken
[42:56] word seed bride you are the eternal life
[42:59] you always was eternal you existed in
[43:01] him he chose you in himself before the
[43:03] foundation of the world
[43:05] there's no defeat in that there's no
[43:08] there's no there's no there's there's
[43:10] nothing but a comfort in that
[43:14] amen
[43:16] amen there there's nothing but absolute
[43:19] security in that
[43:21] when you recognize and realize who you
[43:23] are that's our victory
[43:26] we are the victory we are his victory
[43:31] and it's a great love story
[43:34] because god expressed himself down here
[43:36] and became you unveiled what was in the
[43:38] back part of his mind unveiled it to us
[43:41] in this hour took the lid off of the
[43:43] bible took the lid off and and white
[43:45] stone that had no writing on it has now
[43:48] been revealed to us what wasn't said
[43:54] in those seven thunders
[43:58] amen
[43:59] and that's the that revelation is the
[44:01] only thing going to take you in a
[44:02] rapture
[44:05] without that you'll never go in a
[44:06] rapture god kept it secret until he
[44:10] unveiled the secret and its only secret
[44:12] can be unveiled to his bride is the only
[44:14] one that can receive it so aren't you
[44:16] glad you see it aren't you glad you're
[44:18] in him and to try to get it any other
[44:20] way you see is
[44:23] you can you can lay back here but what's
[44:25] come further than pentecost
[44:27] is the is the fullness
[44:30] of pentecost the full revelation of
[44:33] jesus christ has been manifested in us
[44:36] for one purpose the rapture you will
[44:38] find no comfort through any other kind
[44:41] of teaching through any psychology to
[44:43] any learning of man you cannot give
[44:45] comfort neither will you have comfort
[44:47] outside of the revelation of jesus
[44:49] christ in you and if you can't give that
[44:51] to others how do you expect to comfort
[44:53] them
[44:54] and try to mix that with the word it's
[44:57] denominational
[45:01] denominational
[45:09] that's exactly the truth
[45:11] you can't mix the word with your ideas
[45:15] the word stands alone
[45:18] you can't bring comfort any other way
[45:20] but through the revelation of the word
[45:24] you can give a temporary fix
[45:26] but to have the fix in that soul you'll
[45:29] never be able to do that except god
[45:31] reveals his word individually and
[45:33] personally to you as the person of
[45:35] christ in you and then you come to
[45:37] yourself
[45:42] amen
[45:44] hallelujah for whatsoever is born of god
[45:46] overcometh the world and this is the
[45:48] victory that overcometh the world our
[45:52] faith
[45:54] who is our faith his
[45:57] faith
[45:59] our faith is his faith
[46:02] it's his faith
[46:04] that'll deliver and make it change your
[46:06] mortal body
[46:07] it's his faith
[46:10] amen no other faith
[46:13] you can have an intellectual faith it
[46:15] will not deliver it will not comfort it
[46:18] cannot give a lasting comfort you can
[46:21] speak to the spirit you can have all the
[46:23] emotions you want but unless that word
[46:25] drops in that soul there's nothing else
[46:28] but comfort in jesus christ that's the
[46:30] only comfort you can give people
[46:35] teach them to cast their cares upon
[46:36] christ
[46:38] teach them to cast their cares upon him
[46:40] alone
[46:42] now to sub upon some book of learning
[46:48] amen
[46:49] amen i'm talking about the revelation in
[46:51] the bride i'm talking about the
[46:53] revelation of this word himself revealed
[46:56] in you eternal life is not a as not a a
[47:00] piece of territory a piece of
[47:03] land it's a person
[47:05] the person of christ in you and the only
[47:08] way you're to get from here into a body
[47:10] change is let the leadership of that
[47:12] person lead you
[47:16] you have to come under the leadership of
[47:18] eternal life
[47:21] amen
[47:23] amen and that
[47:25] has to be an unveiling of the word in
[47:27] you which is the birth is the revelation
[47:30] of jesus christ
[47:33] you say you make it too you make it too
[47:35] hard no it's not too hard it just needs
[47:37] to be revealed
[47:40] because when it's revealed it's too
[47:42] simple
[47:45] you can't figure it out in your mind
[47:47] that's the reason you'll either say it's
[47:49] too deep or not it's one of the other
[47:51] but when the word is revealed
[47:55] it's simple it went beyond your human
[47:57] intellect
[47:59] and god reserves that right to himself
[48:02] to reveal to whom he will but he will
[48:04] reveal what he promised he would reveal
[48:07] himself to and that's his people his
[48:09] bride
[48:10] his elect the only one that can be
[48:12] reborn in this hour is the elect right
[48:16] because in non-elect there's nothing in
[48:18] them to be quick
[48:20] they can have all the emotions they can
[48:22] have the emotions of the believer they
[48:23] can they can do everything a believer
[48:26] can do
[48:27] outwardly
[48:28] without the revelation of the word
[48:32] that's the truth
[48:35] we might as well just face brass tacks
[48:36] right down the line you can be anointed
[48:38] of the holy ghost in your spirit
[48:41] and still go to hell
[48:43] amen
[48:45] but unless that holy ghost has got to
[48:46] drop in your soul let me just say this
[48:48] with it when you have the desire and the
[48:50] longing for more of god in your heart
[48:52] you can't get enough of him now you know
[48:55] you're on the track for the rapture
[48:58] because when that hunger is down inside
[49:00] of you there's a deep calling to the
[49:01] deep there's got to be a deep here to
[49:03] respond to that call or you would have
[49:04] never had the deep calling
[49:11] so when that calling is in you i can
[49:13] tell you and bring it to one place
[49:14] that'll give it to you
[49:17] and that's jesus christ who is here
[49:19] present now in bride form and the blood
[49:22] speaking and the blood has been speaking
[49:25] and it's the message of the hour he said
[49:27] bride form yes sir that's the message of
[49:29] the hour
[49:30] it's the son of man in the bright form
[49:33] and the word and the word has been
[49:34] unveiled the back part of his mind the
[49:36] mystery had un has been unveiled to us
[49:39] and we have a right to feed on it we
[49:41] have a right to lay in the presence of
[49:43] it
[49:47] why would do we go to other things
[49:51] put the word in your home put the word
[49:53] in your family put the word there
[49:56] deliver the soul
[49:58] amen
[50:00] we can impart life to believers how many
[50:01] believe that we have we have the ability
[50:04] because of christ in us to impart life
[50:07] to believers
[50:10] amen and we're that's what we're here
[50:13] for
[50:15] the blood is speaking
[50:18] the final voice under her message of the
[50:20] bride is the final voice
[50:22] what's speaking
[50:24] the token is speaking the person of
[50:26] christ is speaking it will leave the
[50:29] word
[50:33] and don't dibble dabble around other
[50:34] things that's not in the word quit your
[50:37] mixing the word with your intellects
[50:42] amen human intellect
[50:46] your understanding is not your
[50:48] understanding it's his understanding
[50:51] but putting your reasoning opinion to
[50:53] the to the promise take it the way it is
[50:56] so be it unto me according to thy word
[51:01] amen
[51:09] let's go to hebrews i didn't get the
[51:11] hebrews did i
[51:13] but that says you know what that
[51:15] scripture hebrews 1 1
[51:17] but i want to show you this what is this
[51:20] what is this
[51:22] victory we have
[51:24] why do you say our faith is our victory
[51:26] the bible said our faith is our victory
[51:28] is the victory that overcometh the world
[51:31] but hebrews 11 1 i didn't say i said one
[51:33] one i'm sorry 11 1.
[51:38] now faith is
[51:40] the substance
[51:43] of things hoped for
[51:45] amen now faith is the substance of
[51:48] things hoped for
[51:50] what's your hope what the promise gives
[51:52] you
[51:54] what the promise promises you you have
[51:56] the word you have the promise
[51:59] amen that's your hope
[52:02] but when you have when you have the
[52:03] faith
[52:05] amen it gives you the substance
[52:10] amen it's the substance of things hoped
[52:13] for it's a revelation it's the substance
[52:16] of things hoped for you see you already
[52:18] have the victory of what the word gave
[52:20] you you've got the victory because your
[52:22] faith because your faith is in the word
[52:24] your faith rests in the unfailing word
[52:29] your faith rests there that's where
[52:31] faith rests
[52:32] faith rests in the unmovable unfailing
[52:35] eternal word
[52:37] that's where it rests
[52:38] amen and faith is the substance of
[52:41] things hoped for the evidence
[52:45] of things not seen
[52:47] you have the very evidence you've got
[52:49] the evidence of it
[52:51] amen
[52:52] of what's not seen
[52:54] you see i don't see it yet abraham
[52:56] didn't see the son yet
[52:58] amen but he had the evidence
[53:01] what was the evidence it was revealed to
[53:03] him he'll have the son
[53:06] amen he had the evidence of it
[53:09] hallelujah
[53:10] amen
[53:13] the holy spirit the prophet says the
[53:15] holy spirit has been bound by these
[53:17] denominational rivers for almost 2 000
[53:20] years
[53:21] but is to be loosed in the evening time
[53:24] by the evening time message
[53:30] the holy spirit is to be loosed in the
[53:32] evening time
[53:34] by the evening time message
[53:38] the holy we know what the evening time
[53:39] message is
[53:42] it's revelations 10.
[53:47] is that right
[53:50] without that you wouldn't be in a
[53:51] rapture
[53:52] without the unveiling of that little
[53:54] book what where's your name what's your
[53:56] name how is he calling you he's calling
[53:59] you by name
[54:02] amen it's calling you by name
[54:05] what name
[54:09] there's only one name given among men
[54:11] whereby you must be saved
[54:13] how's he going to call you you're the
[54:15] mystery you are the mystery revealed in
[54:17] the book
[54:22] amen then he's calling you by name
[54:25] you respond to that because that's in
[54:28] you to respond
[54:30] you're a part of it all along
[54:32] you were just hidden there it was a
[54:35] secret hidden
[54:43] the holy spirit
[54:45] you but is loosed in the evening time by
[54:48] the evening time message the holy spirit
[54:50] back in the church again
[54:54] christ himself revealed in human flesh
[54:57] as i said our message is the fullness
[55:00] they pentecos didn't have the fullness
[55:03] but we have the fullness so let us be
[55:05] glad and rejoice for the marriage has
[55:07] come
[55:11] and she that was ready went into the
[55:13] marriage with him she had to be ready
[55:16] she had to come through her pentecost to
[55:19] be ready she had to be born
[55:22] but wentworth further than that there's
[55:24] something come alive in her she was
[55:26] bearing a word eternal word child
[55:31] is that right
[55:33] she was bearing the message himself
[55:37] himself and her
[55:38] what is she doing she's manifesting him
[55:44] she's carrying him
[55:46] for what purpose
[55:47] till for a meeting
[55:49] it had to come to manifestation
[55:53] the sun had to be the head the sun had
[55:55] to come we have to come to a full
[55:57] adoption
[55:59] we've got to come to a physical con
[56:02] a physical meeting
[56:05] not a i don't i'm not talking about
[56:07] physical the way you think physical but
[56:09] there's a meeting in the air
[56:11] we're going to meet the one we've been
[56:13] holding spiritually within us that's
[56:16] alive in us we have become one
[56:19] we're laying in the presence of the sun
[56:21] ripening
[56:25] and she had to have a change she had
[56:27] that come through her pentecost abraham
[56:28] sarah had to have it and they had that
[56:31] before the conception
[56:33] and when they conceived then she
[56:35] conceived and bear it brother braham
[56:37] said though this little bride is
[56:38] impregnated with life
[56:40] bearing his name bearing his life
[56:44] amen
[56:45] conceived what's she coming to what's
[56:48] being what's coming forth brother brown
[56:50] said that life she's she's poor she the
[56:53] life has come into her and she's bearing
[56:55] a word eternal word child
[57:01] amen
[57:04] i'm just going to say these things
[57:06] because i'm trusting you get home and
[57:08] you'll go to searching out what has been
[57:10] said not enough time to say it all right
[57:13] you can't speak at all
[57:16] but it's the word for the season
[57:19] this is where we are we're in a present
[57:21] tense hour
[57:24] that was the hour that was the hour of
[57:26] his mystery to be revealed that was the
[57:28] hour this is bride time brother sister
[57:30] this is the bride age this is the
[57:33] raptured age
[57:37] we've stepped beyond pentecost
[57:40] they made that made way for the holy
[57:42] ghost himself to come right down in
[57:44] perfection again back to the word
[57:47] back to the word back back to a full and
[57:50] a full reality we didn't know we didn't
[57:53] know we are we realize now that we're
[57:55] his blood and we're his life
[57:57] we're flesh of his flesh and bone of his
[57:59] bone
[58:01] for his body
[58:04] there's no defeat in that
[58:08] there's no way to be defeated the word
[58:11] can't be defeated
[58:15] and you're that revealed word and it
[58:17] can't be defeated
[58:20] amen it just can't be
[58:22] that's our faith
[58:26] that's our faith
[58:29] this is our victory
[58:32] when you can face you can face any test
[58:34] you can face any one of these things
[58:36] this faith mastered every circumstance
[58:39] what kind of faith am i talking about
[58:41] perfect faith
[58:44] not a faith a perfect faith brother
[58:46] baptist i'm going to preach about faith
[58:47] tonight but i'm going to preach about a
[58:49] different kind of faith
[58:52] there's great things to be done through
[58:53] an intellectual faith but when it comes
[58:55] down to perfect faith there's no way to
[58:58] make a rapture outside of perfect faith
[59:01] abraham had perfect faith when god said
[59:03] go go surrender and go kill your son
[59:05] isaac
[59:06] and he obeyed and went
[59:09] not even knowing where he's going
[59:11] he just obeyed that's perfect faith
[59:16] hallelujah
[59:19] i pray that god will just take this
[59:22] and at least make you hungry for more
[59:24] i'm hungry for more i want more you
[59:26] think i i brother sister paul said when
[59:29] you think you know it you don't know
[59:31] what you ought to know
[59:34] and yet we know what we know and yet we
[59:36] don't know what we ought to know yet it
[59:38] just keeps on constantly unveiling but
[59:40] what we know we're sharing
[59:42] we're sharing with the people of god
[59:45] that's what the bible said to do
[59:49] amen because faith comes by hearing
[59:52] hearing the word ministered in faith
[59:55] ministered in revelation for the season
[59:58] it brings a faith to the people of god
[1:00:02] amen
[1:00:04] god opens the door of revelation
[1:00:06] the revealing of himself in you is the
[1:00:09] victory the revealing of himself in you
[1:00:12] is who you are
[1:00:16] you find who you are as himself
[1:00:18] all right let's just go over this as
[1:00:20] quick as i can i don't want to take much
[1:00:22] time here
[1:00:25] so it's been bound but loose in the end
[1:00:27] time message the holy spirit back in the
[1:00:29] church again
[1:00:31] back in the church again christ himself
[1:00:33] revealed in human flesh
[1:00:38] amen
[1:00:39] christ himself revealed in human flesh
[1:00:42] in the evening time
[1:00:44] he said he promised it
[1:00:49] and here we are saying this day this
[1:00:51] message this day these promises this day
[1:00:56] these things are being fulfilled right
[1:00:58] here in our midst and we see it we heard
[1:01:00] of thee by the year now we see
[1:01:03] more and more more and more and it's

[1:11:20] the reality that he's here
[1:11:24] where's the message of the hour
[1:11:27] where's it being lived
[1:11:29] where is it unveiled
[1:11:32] it's in the bright form
[1:11:40] i haven't even got past the first
[1:11:41] paragraph
[1:11:44] can't you see where we're standing
[1:11:48] it goes right behind it can't you see
[1:11:50] where we're standing
[1:11:52] life
[1:11:53] life eternal life is in the grain again
[1:11:57] it's come up through its carriers now
[1:12:00] it's come out of the last carry of the
[1:12:01] shock what has the life the life of
[1:12:04] jesus christ it's here now again in seed
[1:12:06] form it's him again that's present with
[1:12:10] us
[1:12:11] we ought to be reverent and humble and
[1:12:12] quit you're fooling around with man's
[1:12:14] psychologies
[1:12:18] get down to business with this message
[1:12:21] you're going to help anyone help them
[1:12:22] through this word you can't help them
[1:12:24] any other way but by the revelation of
[1:12:25] jesus christ
[1:12:29] how dare anybody try to mix that thing
[1:12:31] with some denominational spirit
[1:12:37] so why you so hitting that because
[1:12:38] that's what's got to be hidden this hour
[1:12:41] that's what's trying to infiltrate
[1:12:42] churches is trying to come amongst the
[1:12:44] bride she will not move off of that
[1:12:48] word if irene is being the being chosen
[1:12:52] over polycarp for the first messenger of
[1:12:54] the age
[1:12:55] you know where i'm going brother paul
[1:12:57] polycarp lean toward organization of man
[1:13:00] fellowship of man
[1:13:02] but irenaeus not so he real he leaned
[1:13:05] toward an individual reality of jesus
[1:13:07] christ in them and he was militant
[1:13:09] against any form of organization
[1:13:15] nominational spirit it's a woman's
[1:13:17] spirit
[1:13:18] if you're not careful you'll let the
[1:13:19] woman lead you right down the wrong path
[1:13:22] and and still say we believe a prophet
[1:13:24] we believe his message and mix it with
[1:13:26] everything else
[1:13:28] you think this is hard
[1:13:32] better hear it hard
[1:13:33] i don't want your bony fingers sticking
[1:13:35] up me in my face
[1:13:37] in the in the time of judgment saying
[1:13:38] you didn't tell me
[1:13:40] i'm a minister i'm obligated to do what
[1:13:43] god wants me to do through this word
[1:13:47] i'm nothing david is nothing
[1:13:49] but my confidence isn't laying in david
[1:13:51] my confidence laying in the person of
[1:13:53] jesus christ eternal life leading me
[1:13:57] home
[1:14:02] you better make sure that what you're
[1:14:04] intending to do is according to this
[1:14:06] promise of the word you better be
[1:14:08] careful that it's not some
[1:14:09] denominational spirit thinking of man
[1:14:12] you better be careful that you let not a
[1:14:14] woman's spirit lead you down the wrong
[1:14:16] path
[1:14:20] time to wake up
[1:14:22] take possession
[1:14:23] of our land
[1:14:28] you say you have to tell the bride that
[1:14:30] yes maybe potential once start go down
[1:14:33] get out of step with the word
[1:14:35] get out of step stay in line
[1:14:38] where do you see those ones getting out
[1:14:40] of step at the last at the last right at
[1:14:43] the last the very last few of them two
[1:14:46] or three were getting out of step in
[1:14:48] step with the promise of the hour the
[1:14:49] word of the hour why because they were
[1:14:51] looking at this church they were getting
[1:14:53] the wrong influence they were being
[1:14:55] influenced by the denominational spirit
[1:14:57] under the auspices of believing the
[1:14:59] message
[1:15:01] getting out of step getting out of step
[1:15:04] he said stay in line then i seen her
[1:15:08] just as
[1:15:09] began to fade i saw her getting back in
[1:15:11] step

[1:15:20] and that head has to come and that
[1:15:22] head's here and there's one thing
[1:15:24] happening the head and the body are
[1:15:25] coming together and the prophet said
[1:15:27] they have already united
[1:15:35] it's an invisible union
[1:15:37] not known to everybody i realize but i'm
[1:15:39] not here to say who is and who isn't i'm
[1:15:42] here to give them the word and if it
[1:15:44] unveils something that you know isn't
[1:15:45] right then it's a love of god towards
[1:15:47] you now you have a chance either accept
[1:15:49] it or reject it
[1:15:51] i don't care you say well what if this
[1:15:52] if i do that what is this one going to
[1:15:54] think what is this then you become
[1:15:56] afraid of what they think and you have
[1:15:58] an idol before you other than the word
[1:16:00] the living word

[1:20:38] the new birth but have no discernment of
[1:20:41] the hour
[1:20:43] they have no discernment of where god is
[1:20:45] living
[1:20:47] they have no discernment of what
[1:20:48] position he's in in this hour
[1:20:52] he had to fulfill the scripture
[1:20:54] of the bride and the groom or be no
[1:20:56] there would be no eden
[1:20:58] had to come back to full restoration
[1:21:03] amen so he's got to have a bride he's
[1:21:05] got to have a bride that matches him you
[1:21:07] got to have a bride that's a complete
[1:21:09] revelation of himself it completes it
[1:21:12] do you stop and think at your position
[1:21:16] well i might fail there is no failure in
[1:21:18] that
[1:21:20] revelation
[1:21:22] it's your victory
[1:21:24] what i'm trying to say this revelation
[1:21:26] is your victory look i take the time i
[1:21:28] don't have the time go back into page
[1:21:31] 150 151 152 153
[1:21:35] 154 in the church age book and see what
[1:21:37] he said
[1:21:38] because he turned a corner we have the
[1:21:41] third pull the opening of the word
[1:21:44] among us
[1:21:47] but it's so
[1:21:48] well i will go there i'll just let me
[1:21:50] finish this up i know you're letting me
[1:21:52] amen i'm not that quite that place yet
[1:21:54] but i here we go are you ready hold on
[1:21:57] tighten your seat belt
[1:21:59] all right
[1:22:03] it's the same god
[1:22:05] brother paul you brought this out is not
[1:22:06] another god a revelation of jesus christ
[1:22:08] is not another god it's god abundance
[1:22:10] god with us god in us it's god above us
[1:22:14] god above us god in the son god and

[1:22:19] holy spirit in you amen are you tell me
[1:22:22] where there's any defeat in that
[1:22:26] the revelation is who you are over
[1:22:27] revelation is who you are and that's our
[1:22:30] faith
[1:22:32] amen amen amen
[1:22:34] i wish i could emphasize that
[1:22:37] but it just i'm emphasizing as hard as i
[1:22:39] can
[1:22:40] all right now
[1:22:42] but it takes the revelation
[1:22:45] see that's why god reserved that for the
[1:22:47] bride
[1:22:49] he reserved
[1:22:50] revelation because you can't manufacture
[1:22:53] that
[1:22:54] but it does come by hearing the word
[1:22:56] for your day for your hour for your time
[1:23:00] amen
[1:23:02] amen i'm not when i say hearing i'm not
[1:23:05] talking about quit reading
[1:23:08] i'm talking about quit reading
[1:23:11] feed on it
[1:23:13] hear it
[1:23:14] come wanna come wanna be hear the word
[1:23:16] wanna hear it preach wanna hear it
[1:23:18] revealed want to hear want to hear what
[1:23:20] the prophet said
[1:23:22] want to hear what the what he said about
[1:23:24] this word go back and search the
[1:23:26] scriptures go back and find out what he
[1:23:28] said and laying right there in the word
[1:23:30] find let god reveal what he said and
[1:23:32] reveal it to you in the scriptures
[1:23:35] then you're saying what he said
[1:23:38] amen all right
[1:23:41] now
[1:23:43] notice making it known by revelation god
[1:23:46] is making himself known
[1:23:49] the tree of life the tree of christ's
[1:23:51] body
[1:23:53] that's christ in the church today taking
[1:23:56] his wife back
[1:23:57] see the threefold mystery god was in
[1:24:00] christ christ manifested in the church
[1:24:02] all that god was he poured into christ
[1:24:04] all that christ was he poured in that
[1:24:06] word interesting word poured brother
[1:24:09] branham page 27 said he's pouring
[1:24:10] himself pouring himself into her they
[1:24:13] are becoming one
[1:24:15] for the wedding supper
[1:24:19] you mean this could be a mysterious
[1:24:20] thing that's happening it could be
[1:24:22] running right through you and you don't
[1:24:24] many don't i don't say you don't but
[1:24:26] many don't
[1:24:28] know it
[1:24:33] they don't really know that jesus is the
[1:24:35] christ
[1:24:38] because to know that jesus is the christ
[1:24:40] he's present tense
[1:24:45] jesus is the christ
[1:24:48] present tense
[1:24:50] he that believes that
[1:24:52] that's our faith
[1:24:53] he that believes that
[1:24:55] is born again
[1:24:57] born of the spirit
[1:25:01] well
[1:25:02] what would make you not want to be born
[1:25:04] of the spirit
[1:25:06] what would make you shy from that
[1:25:10] you'd want that you'd want that so bad
[1:25:13] you'd you could almost taste it and you
[1:25:15] can you can eat it
[1:25:20] that's right let god start revealing
[1:25:22] himself in you you that's the spirit in
[1:25:24] you doing it see the birth is so simple
[1:25:28] people make it too complicated
[1:25:30] it's that word that's come alive in you
[1:25:33] you had an ear to hear the word
[1:25:34] is christ revealed in you jesus christ
[1:25:37] is the revelation of god that's simple
[1:25:41] jesus christ is the revelation of the
[1:25:44] word
[1:25:45] what about that word revealed in you who
[1:25:47] is it
[1:25:48] when it points you back the word and
[1:25:50] hold you and won't let you pass from
[1:25:52] this word i don't care how much you did
[1:25:54] this and did that and did this you can
[1:25:56] be without this in you
[1:25:59] it's got to come off of this
[1:26:01] to revelation amen
[1:26:05] amen
[1:26:07] amen amen
[1:26:09] all right let's see if we can close
[1:26:11] i'll just pass the first page here and
[1:26:13] see what i can it's back to the original
[1:26:15] adam and eve again man and woman which
[1:26:17] are one made out of the same blood
[1:26:19] same spirit and everything else
[1:26:23] and makes the church the blood of christ
[1:26:25] by the spirit
[1:26:27] amen
[1:26:28] and that holy ghost that baptizes you
[1:26:31] into his body that holy ghost will only
[1:26:34] recognize his body his flesh his word
[1:26:38] think of that if you have the holy ghost
[1:26:40] in you
[1:26:41] you'll discern the scriptures you'll
[1:26:42] discern the hour you're living in
[1:26:46] is not what he promised
[1:26:48] he said he would reveal these things to
[1:26:50] you and make it known
[1:26:51] where's the evidence laid then of the
[1:26:53] holy ghost

[1:26:56] it in you
[1:26:59] gives you have an ear to hear
[1:27:02] amen
[1:27:04] amen and that holy ghost is going to

[1:27:29] that your faith has been received well i
[1:27:31] believe in the blood have you received
[1:27:33] the token identification that your
[1:27:37] your
[1:27:38] faith is his amen

[1:28:02] i believe that
[1:28:05] i believe in the leadership of eternal
[1:28:07] life
[1:28:08] i believe you can know it so clearly
[1:28:10] that you'll let go and let him do it
[1:28:13] quit questioning him in his leadership
[1:28:16] but he's not going to lead you off the
[1:28:17] word and if he's leading you off the
[1:28:19] word and you're not discerning it you
[1:28:21] need to be born again
[1:28:27] that's right
[1:28:28] it's the truth
[1:28:30] you see where we're at your husband's
[1:28:32] not discerning what your wife wears out
[1:28:34] comes out of the street out of the home
[1:28:36] dressed in things so tight draws a man's
[1:28:38] attention to her she presents herself

[1:30:14] how do we overcome
[1:30:16] recognizing that devil let the holy
[1:30:18] spirit recognize that devil in every one
[1:30:20] of his tricks
[1:30:22] and realize next realize that you have
[1:30:24] overcome him
[1:30:25] not through your ability but the ability
[1:30:27] of the holy spirit in you has already
[1:30:29] defeated him
[1:30:31] and he's defeated

[1:30:37] now
[1:30:38] amen
[1:30:41] look what was once god's mysterious
[1:30:43] secret
[1:30:44] in his mind is now put in the hearts of
[1:30:46] the believer that is the body of christ
[1:30:49] once god's great secret in his mind
[1:30:52] before the foundation world is now made
[1:30:54] manifest is now made manifest think of
[1:30:56] it oh my
[1:31:00] amen think of it think of it
[1:31:06] but he has a secret he sealed it up
[1:31:11] couldn't be open until the seven seals
[1:31:13] were opened
[1:31:14] and revealed the hidden secret
[1:31:18] of what those sunders said
[1:31:20] the bride must know it
[1:31:24] and she will
[1:31:25] and she is
[1:31:27] and is being preached
[1:31:31] amen all right
[1:31:35] but god's great mystery what the eternal
[1:31:37] god had as a mystery has now unfolded in
[1:31:40] jesus christ then given right down to
[1:31:42] his bride what was once in god's mind is
[1:31:45] now in the body of christ jesus making
[1:31:48] love to his church it's the greatest
[1:31:50] love story
[1:31:54] the two loves of filio and agape are so
[1:31:57] close together would deceive the elected
[1:31:59] if possible
[1:32:03] that's the truth
[1:32:04] you can love ephelio love and have a
[1:32:06] friendship love and say it's a love of
[1:32:08] god but the love of god will recognize
[1:32:10] the truth

[1:32:44] just to her
[1:32:46] he said i don't mean these flirters
[1:32:48] i'm talking about his wife
[1:32:51] i mean his wife
[1:32:53] by having the revelation of this secret
[1:32:55] made known to them
[1:32:57] by his grace
[1:33:00] amen
[1:33:02] amen all right
[1:33:04] just about time to close
[1:33:06] what is it it's not them people
[1:33:09] not the person that comes predestinated
[1:33:11] eternally from god
[1:33:13] it's the seed
[1:33:15] it's that seed
[1:33:17] amen
[1:33:19] you ever get a hold of that revelation
[1:33:21] brother sister you you can realize you
[1:33:23] conquered this devil that keeps wanting
[1:33:25] to point his finger at your little bony
[1:33:27] flesh
[1:33:28] and tell you did this and you did that
[1:33:30] you can turn right back to him i never
[1:33:31] did it at all
[1:33:36] i never did it at all
[1:33:39] who do you think you are jesus christ
[1:33:41] the revealed word
[1:33:46] that's exactly right
[1:33:47] i'm not boasting about nothing but
[1:33:49] that's the truth
[1:33:50] they hated it yesterday in his day
[1:33:52] they'll hate it now when the bride
[1:33:54] begins to come boldly more and more to
[1:33:56] testify of who she is and where she
[1:33:58] stands
[1:34:00] not doing it arrogantly we're not doing
[1:34:01] it for show we're not doing it to draw
[1:34:03] attention we're doing it because it's
[1:34:05] the truth
[1:34:07] and it's the substance of things hoped
[1:34:09] for and it's the evidence of things not
[1:34:11] seen
[1:34:12] and we live by that
[1:34:16] faith amen
[1:34:19] amen
[1:34:21] the headship in the body has become one
[1:34:24] unit it's god manifested in his people
[1:34:28] that's the reason husband and wife is no
[1:34:30] longer twin you can see why that female
[1:34:33] denominating spirit hates this type of
[1:34:36] message
[1:34:39] why
[1:34:44] because not the right seed
[1:34:55] well they can live the part walk the
[1:34:57] park speak the part
[1:34:59] act the part but have no life
[1:35:02] you know that's the truth go back to
[1:35:04] annoyed one's the end time
[1:35:06] go back to every message after that
[1:35:08] brother brown and practically every
[1:35:09] message brings that ministry that
[1:35:11] mystery out of that every single time
[1:35:13] why because it was important that we
[1:35:15] knew this at the end time when it was to
[1:35:17] be manifest and we wouldn't let that be
[1:35:19] deceiving us
[1:35:23] is that right
[1:35:24] that's exactly right
[1:35:26] amen
[1:35:29] amen
[1:35:30] brother david your preacher likes the
[1:35:31] last message you preach maybe it will be
[1:35:33] i don't know i'm getting up in age
[1:35:37] i don't know when the last message will
[1:35:39] i intend to stay right here
[1:35:41] leaning on his everlasting arms and let
[1:35:43] him continue to reveal it and i expect
[1:35:46] him to live it
[1:35:47] i expect to live it because he's living
[1:35:49] it his ways are perfect and my ways are
[1:35:52] made perfect because i'm in him and he's
[1:35:54] in me how can i say that his leadership
[1:35:57] would be imperfect is because i put my
[1:35:59] own ideas my own thinking to it instead
[1:36:02] of taking him at his word and let him
[1:36:04] vindicate that word in me and testify of
[1:36:06] it through me
[1:36:10] my
[1:36:12] my my i'm trying to find a place to stop
[1:36:14] i really am
[1:36:16] it just keeps coming in waves over me
[1:36:18] and waves over me

[1:37:14] put anything above that
[1:37:17] that's hard preaching i know it's hard
[1:37:19] preaching
[1:37:22] but it's truth
[1:37:24] i
[1:37:24] know it's to me also
[1:37:28] and it makes me tremble because i've got

[1:38:24] taking away
[1:38:26] that denominational spirit is nothing
[1:38:28] but adding to the word or taking from
[1:38:30] the word
