[36:17] Morning Saints Rosia Santos it's good to
[36:21] be back in the house of the Lord
[36:23] and see all our visitors from far away
[36:29] and that's why we have a translator
[36:31] foreign
[36:38] and it might take a little longer
[36:41] but there's only one service today
[36:45] so all you got to do is pay attention
[36:48] you see this is already up here
[36:52] sure for a reason
[36:55] so we're in Acts chapter 21 today
[37:00] and you stay seated because we're going
[37:02] to go through this very slowly
[37:06] and so in this chapter the sea Journey
[37:09] continues
[37:13] they've been coming south from Turkey
[37:16] down into caesarea um
[37:21] so they land in what's currently Lebanon
[37:26] um
[37:27] and so they minister to the Saints there
[37:30] for about a week
[37:38] and finding disciples we tarry their
[37:41] seven days who said to Paul through the
[37:43] spirit that he should not go to
[37:45] Jerusalem foreign
[38:07] and so we departed and went our way and
[38:10] they all brought us on our way with
[38:12] wives and children until we were out of
[38:15] the city and we kneel down in the shore
[38:17] and prayed our company
[38:25] now you might wonder why are we going
[38:27] through all these details
[38:32] because the promise of the age was I'm
[38:35] going to send you Elijah is going to
[38:36] bring you back to the originals
[38:41] and so also in one of the greatest
[38:44] experiences Brothers
[38:48] he was beyond the curtain of time
[38:52] and sometimes we get lost with the shiny
[38:54] teeth and the bright eyes and all the
[38:56] beautiful things
[39:02] but the the angel said and you're going
[39:05] to be judged for what you said
[39:22] we want to go back and erase a few
[39:24] things
[39:30] it's usually me over there
[39:34] but um brother Brown didn't even take a
[39:36] breath he said what about Paul
[39:40] and he said we'll probably be judged for
[39:43] what he said
[39:45] brother said well if his people get in
[39:47] my people get in
[39:51] because I have preached everything just
[39:53] like Paul this is
[39:56] and all of us that were there
[39:59] we said we're depending on that right
[40:04] so it's not a waste of time to go
[40:07] through the book of Acts
[40:11] just look at that verse five they were
[40:13] up there ministering for a week
[40:18] and then they came down to the Shoreline
[40:21] Rivera
[40:23] with the wives with the children
[40:27] just like this crowd here
[40:31] so they're on so they're on the beach of
[40:34] the Mediterranean
[40:36] and they're kneeling down and they're
[40:38] praying
[40:41] and when we had taken leave of one
[40:43] another we took the ship and returned
[40:46] then they returned home
[40:55] so another tearful goodbye
[40:58] adios so in verse 8 they finally came to
[41:02] caesarea
[41:05] and they came to the home of Philip
[41:09] this is Philip the Evangelist we saw
[41:12] back in chapter six
[41:16] and verse 9 and the same man had four
[41:19] daughters virgins which did prophesy
[41:24] so here's the Fulfillment of Joel's
[41:27] words your daughters shall prophesy
[41:31] and it was manifested to one family is
[41:35] so in verse 10
[41:37] and as we teared there many days there
[41:40] came down from Judea a certain Prophet
[41:42] named agabus
[41:49] and when he was come unto us he took
[41:52] Paul's girl and bound his own hands and
[41:54] feet and said
[41:55] uh the Holy Ghost so sheltered and he
[41:59] said thus saith the Holy Ghost so shall
[42:01] the Jews of Jerusalem bind the man that
[42:03] is the owner of the Squirtle and shall
[42:05] deliver him unto the hands of the
[42:07] Gentiles
[42:24] and when you heard these things both we
[42:27] and they the of the place he sought him
[42:30] not to go to Jerusalem
[42:37] so at every stop it's the same morning
[42:43] even with the Vindicated prophet
[42:46] and Paul says no I must go
[42:51] I'm not I'm not scared to die
[42:55] but I'm going to Jerusalem in the name
[42:58] of Jesus Christ
[43:00] and so that's why today we preach from
[43:03] William branham's absolute the
[43:04] scriptures
[43:09] Corinthians chapter two for a minute
[43:11] foreign
[43:15] Corinthians 2 and verse 1 and 2 it says
[43:19] and I Brethren when I came to you so
[43:21] he's talking back to these people where
[43:23] he's been
[43:24] my brother when I came to you came not
[43:26] with Excellency of speech or wisdom
[43:28] declaring unto you the testimony of God
[43:31] is
[43:40] for I determined not to know anything
[43:42] among you saved Jesus Christ and him
[43:45] crucified
[43:50] in verse
[43:52] that your faith should not stand in the
[43:55] wisdom of man but in the power of God
[44:02] so we've known many people that have
[44:04] learned the gospel to such a degree
[44:10] and I can convince people that this is
[44:13] right
[44:15] but then the first storm that comes
[44:17] through
[44:19] they're blown away
[44:21] it's got to be the power of God
[44:26] the gospel is not complicated
[44:29] it's a simple gospel
[44:33] Jesus Christ died and rose again for
[44:35] your salvation
[44:38] so after many warnings from good friends
[44:41] and very spiritual people
[44:46] amigos
[44:48] don't go to Jerusalem
[44:50] Paul and his associates arrive in
[44:53] Jerusalem
[45:07] and the day following Paul went in with
[45:09] us unto James and all the elders were
[45:11] present
[45:12] the uh yes
[45:19] so just to give you a little highlight
[45:22] here there's several James in the
[45:24] scripture is
[45:27] this one here James the Apostle
[45:32] he's the son of seven
[45:35] James and John
[45:37] and then there was James the Apostle son
[45:40] of alphaeus
[45:48] um and he um he's also known as James
[45:51] the less
[45:56] because he'll be shorter than the other
[45:58] one
[46:01] at all times together
[46:03] you just have to get in and read it
[46:06] and then there's James our Lord's carnal
[46:09] brother
[46:13] and then there's James the father of
[46:15] Judas the Apostle
[46:19] so in Jerusalem Paul met with the
[46:22] apostles
[46:24] and the church leaders
[46:27] and he told them the many things that
[46:29] happened on his trip
[46:32] and they were very pleased and they
[46:35] glorified God is
[46:37] and this could have been as late as 56
[46:40] A.D is
[46:44] and this would have been about 20 years
[46:46] after the day of Pentecost experience
[46:52] so then they said to Paul now look
[46:54] brother we have a problem here in in
[46:56] Jerusalem
[46:59] you're aware that thousands of Jews have
[47:02] believed uh
[47:07] and they are jealous of the law they
[47:09] want to stay straight
[47:12] but they've been informed about you
[47:17] they've been told by other Jews out
[47:20] there among the Gentiles
[47:26] you told people to forsake the the
[47:29] message of Moses
[47:34] and forget circumcision
[47:37] and to forsake the customs of the law
[47:42] and there's no secrets they know you're
[47:44] here
[47:44] [Music]
[47:46] so we have a plan
[47:48] we got four men willing to go with you
[47:53] you take them with you
[47:56] and you purify yourselves
[47:58] Contigo foreign
[48:19] and so
[48:21] he did what he could and he took them in
[48:23] and
[48:26] um they um uh but once again the the
[48:29] twin was present
[48:32] s
[48:34] and you can always count on it until the
[48:37] day of the Rapture
[48:40] and see you're looking at two people but
[48:42] we're looking at you know about 60
[48:44] people this is
[48:47] we see the reactions
[48:50] and we see the different colors
[48:53] and in every congregation no matter how
[48:56] small it is there's three kinds of
[48:58] Believers
[49:00] yeah in First Corinthians
[49:05] and see what we have over here Paul's
[49:07] words also
[49:11] 13 and 14 of chapter 10.
[49:15] says here there had no temptation taken
[49:18] you but such as common to man but God is
[49:20] faithful who will not suffer you to be
[49:22] tempted above what you're able but with
[49:24] the Temptation also make a way to escape
[49:27] that you may be able to bear it
[49:50] we've got a study on on idolatry and
[49:53] images and so forth
[49:58] It's amazing like this why did it
[50:01] idolatry come into this portion right
[50:04] here
[50:06] because it's very important
[50:08] and you will have problems until the day
[50:11] you leave this planet
[50:16] so back to acts 21 verse 27
[50:23] and when the seven days were almost
[50:25] ended the Jews which were of Asia when
[50:28] they saw him in the temple stirred up
[50:30] all the people and laid hands on him
[50:44] this is the man that teaches men
[50:47] everywhere against the people and the
[50:49] law in this place and further back
[50:51] Greeks also in the temple and have
[50:52] polluted this holy place
[51:10] so they're making things up
[51:13] just like today
[51:16] however you think you might win in
[51:19] politics it won't work
[51:22] because they will take you down
[51:26] so so here we got another riot in
[51:29] Jerusalem
[51:33] and it's a great confusion
[51:38] and the plan was to kill him right there
[51:41] because if we can kill this man problem
[51:44] solved
[51:46] now they didn't have guns
[51:49] but they had some knives they had clubs
[51:54] in verse 31 and as they went about to
[51:58] kill him Tidings came to the chief
[52:00] captain of the band and all Jerusalem
[52:02] was in an uproar Quran
[52:10] so Rome was in charge of the law
[52:15] and they were supposed to be keeping the
[52:17] peace
[52:20] and all this is because of a rumor
[52:24] you know a supposition
[52:27] and so somebody reported it to the
[52:29] police
[52:31] and here comes the chief of police
[52:35] had a number of soldiers with him
[52:38] and when they Riot or saw the police
[52:41] coming
[52:44] so they quit beating him
[52:47] the soldiers you know surrounded Paul
[52:51] Los aldados uh
[52:58] and they asked who he was and what this
[53:00] was all about
[53:04] and the crowd began shouting all kinds
[53:07] of accusations
[53:12] and nothing was understood
[53:14] so the captain said bring him into
[53:17] headquarters
[53:21] so due to the violence of the people
[53:24] this is
[53:26] the soldiers are actually carrying the
[53:29] preacheros
[53:31] and when they got on the stairs
[53:33] because you know the stairs were outside
[53:35] the building
[53:37] so when they get on the stairs
[53:40] um the the people were shouting he
[53:42] should die and do it right now
[53:49] they had no evidence only a supposition
[53:53] so they were blindly loyal to their
[53:57] religion
[53:59] [Music]
[54:00] what they thought to be the truth
[54:03] and they could quote their profit
[54:06] perfectly
[54:09] and they didn't have an iPad
[54:15] but they were bound to determine we're
[54:17] the right ones
[54:21] and they were ready to kill anyone
[54:24] they didn't see it exactly their way
[54:31] blind Fanatics
[54:34] and I know some in the 21st century
[54:39] so they were ready to to die or even to
[54:42] kill for their view of God of yesterday
[54:49] totally ignoring what God was doing
[54:51] present tense
[54:55] and not interested in the future
[54:58] they were content with forms and rituals
[55:06] inquiring word by word
[55:10] but no life
[55:13] and willing to kill anyone
[55:20] so many people weren't here last night
[55:24] we have a way of keeping you awake
[55:27] you're getting this in two languages so
[55:30] surely you can understand something
[55:35] but if you stayed up last night that's
[55:37] not my fault
[55:39] but we will try to wake you up
[55:47] that was a warning
[55:50] and so there's no life when you just you
[55:53] quote quote quote and no life this is
[55:57] the revealed word was a foreign concept
[56:00] to them
[56:04] and all they cared about what did Moses
[56:06] say about this
[56:10] but very selectively ignoring many
[56:14] things he said
[56:17] and they didn't have any recordings to
[56:19] each decide what it really meant
[56:25] you'd be surprised the people that call
[56:27] me
[56:30] and their children get up to about 14
[56:33] years old
[56:36] and they haven't prop they haven't
[56:39] raised them correctly
[56:41] now we got a problem
[56:43] uh what would brother Brandon do okay
[56:48] you're a little bit late for that yeah
[56:51] should have started back here when they
[56:53] were four years old
[56:56] you see God's word is never stagnant
[56:59] like these ponds out here
[57:03] the truth keeps moving
[57:07] Heaven and Earth will pass away
[57:11] all these nice cars they're going to
[57:13] burn one day
[57:15] everything you have is going to burn
[57:18] but my word shall not pass away
[57:22] so the word of God is living and moving
[57:24] and
[57:26] God will find someone
[57:29] somewhere
[57:30] whom he can make it come alive
[57:35] he only has your hands
[57:38] he only has your eyes
[57:40] only your mouth only your feet so
[57:45] Hebrews 13 8 is still real today
[57:49] but we must be totally yielded to God to
[57:52] do with us as he pleases
[57:58] see brother Brandon was born a Seer
[58:03] a prophet that's why we have the picture
[58:07] of the cabin somewhere that oh that's
[58:09] how it started
[58:12] but God could only use him properly when
[58:15] he yielded completely
[58:21] now we're here all the time well we've
[58:23] got to say what he says
[58:27] you want to hear you want to say what
[58:29] William Branham says
[58:33] he says I'm just a sinner saved by grace
[58:40] he says and God can withdraw his Mercy
[58:42] anytime he pleases
[58:47] so what about us
[58:50] we think we're something special
[58:53] only thing that makes us special
[58:57] is that God has chosen you to live out
[59:00] your portion today
[59:04] the portion of the drama of dark
[59:07] laodicea is
[59:12] all the past ages are depending on you
[59:15] to come to Perfection so we can go
[59:20] they're depending on us to live out our
[59:23] portion of the drama
[59:26] because the word says they without us
[59:28] are not made perfect
[59:32] may God have mercy on us
[59:35] and that you can go from here a better
[59:37] Christian Cristiano
[59:40] okay back to our story in 2137
[59:44] 37 yeah 37.
[59:47] and as Paul was led into the castle so
[59:50] he's on the stairway they're leading him
[59:52] up you know he's a prisoner base
[59:58] he said to the chief captain
[1:00:01] may I speak unto thee
[1:00:04] versus
[1:00:10] and he said oh you can speak Greek
[1:00:15] aren't you that Egyptian that was here a
[1:00:18] few days back and made a big uproar and
[1:00:21] took four thousand men into the will of
[1:00:23] murderers
[1:00:33] Paul said I am a man which I'm a Jew of
[1:00:37] Tarsus a city of celicia citizen of no
[1:00:40] mean City I beseech thee suffer me to
[1:00:42] speak to the people
[1:00:44] entonces
[1:00:56] El Pueblo so he at least could speak two
[1:00:59] languages maybe three this is
[1:01:03] and when he had given him you know
[1:01:06] permission Paul stood up on the stairs
[1:01:08] and beckoned with his hand unto the
[1:01:10] people and when there was made a great
[1:01:13] silence he spoke to them in the Hebrew
[1:01:15] tongue is
[1:01:27] now what do you think Paul looked like
[1:01:29] at that point
[1:01:32] you think you look real sharp like like
[1:01:35] Jose
[1:01:57] the officials didn't know who he was
[1:02:00] so they got the crowd quiet
[1:02:05] now this isn't people like burning our
[1:02:08] cities over here a couple years ago
[1:02:12] these are religious people
[1:02:14] they're ready to kill for their relief
[1:02:19] and without a microphone he began
[1:02:22] testifying
[1:02:24] verse 22 and verse 1.
[1:02:28] says here men and Brethren and fathers
[1:02:31] hear ye my defense which I make unto you
[1:02:35] Padres
[1:02:38] and then in princes and when they heard
[1:02:41] that that he spoke in Hebrew to them
[1:02:44] they were even more quiet
[1:02:51] Jew born over here in Tarsus I said with
[1:02:54] celicia yet brought up in the city at
[1:02:56] the feet of Gamaliel and taught
[1:02:57] according to the perfect manner of the
[1:02:59] law of fathers and was zealous towards
[1:03:02] God as you are this day
[1:03:08] is
[1:03:19] and I persecuted this way unto the death
[1:03:22] binding and delivering into prison both
[1:03:25] men and women
[1:03:28] 17.
[1:03:41] and it came to pass that when I was come
[1:03:43] again to Jerusalem even while I prayed
[1:03:45] in the temple I was in a trance like a
[1:03:47] vision is
[1:03:55] and I saw him saying unto me there was
[1:03:58] God saying unto me make haste and get
[1:04:01] thee quickly out of Jerusalem for they
[1:04:03] will not receive thy testimony
[1:04:04] concerning me
[1:04:06] is
[1:04:09] [Music]
[1:04:14] and I said Lord they know that I
[1:04:17] imprisoned and beat in every synagogue
[1:04:19] them that believed on thee is
[1:04:30] uh he's talking about our family
[1:04:33] the people who believe just like us
[1:04:36] hey when the blood of thy martyr Stephen
[1:04:39] was shed I also was standing by and
[1:04:42] consenting to his death and kept the
[1:04:44] arraignment of them that slew him
[1:04:45] [Music]
[1:04:54] so this is the conversation he's having
[1:04:57] with the Lord
[1:05:01] for I will send the hence unto the
[1:05:03] Gentiles
[1:05:07] and they gave him audience so he's
[1:05:09] telling all this to these people in the
[1:05:11] street
[1:05:12] there's thousands no microphones
[1:05:18] and so they listened to him carefully
[1:05:19] and then they lifted up their voices and
[1:05:22] said away with such a fellow up from the
[1:05:23] earth it is not fit that he should live
[1:05:34] and as they cried out and cast off their
[1:05:37] clothes they threw dust in the air
[1:05:39] hey
[1:05:41] [Music]
[1:05:43] and the chief Captain commanded him to
[1:05:45] be brought inside the headquarters the
[1:05:47] castle and bathe that he should be
[1:05:49] examined by scourging that he might know
[1:05:52] whereof they cried against him
[1:06:04] so this is a nice little conference at
[1:06:07] the table hey who are you what's your
[1:06:09] name and fill out the form yes this is
[1:06:15] Scourge means to harass to whip severely
[1:06:18] severely with no mercy
[1:06:23] is so that's the way they inquired back
[1:06:27] there is
[1:06:29] so from chapter 21 Paul is now in jail
[1:06:35] and he's protected from religious
[1:06:37] Fanatics
[1:06:41] and since the Jews were so upset with
[1:06:44] him
[1:06:49] so the the police said well he must be
[1:06:51] guilty of something
[1:06:54] so in 25 it says and as they bound him
[1:06:57] with thongs
[1:07:03] so that's that's leather straps
[1:07:06] so he's like in a straight jacket
[1:07:11] you know and um so as he's bound up Paul
[1:07:15] said unto the Centurion that stood by
[1:07:20] it's a long full for you to Scourge a
[1:07:23] man that is in Roman and uncondemned yes
[1:07:30] and so they didn't know who he was he
[1:07:33] sees the people trying to kill him
[1:07:39] and so the the Roman Roman officer he's
[1:07:43] just a public servant
[1:07:46] official Romano era
[1:07:49] and he has no Revelation or interest in
[1:07:52] the fanatical religion of the Jews
[1:07:58] but he's responsible for the Peace of
[1:08:01] Jerusalem
[1:08:03] so he's going to get to the bottom of
[1:08:05] this problem
[1:08:07] now the Jews are fanatical
[1:08:10] some of you been over there and you met
[1:08:12] some of them
[1:08:17] they have a saying that when two Jews
[1:08:20] are are discussing something
[1:08:24] there's at least three opinions
[1:08:28] so that you can't argue with them
[1:08:33] please come on here in 25
[1:08:36] um
[1:08:37] and 26 and this in turn heard that he
[1:08:40] went and told the chief Captain saying
[1:08:41] take heed what they'll do is because
[1:08:44] this guy's a Roman
[1:08:45] dollars
[1:08:52] then the chief Captain came and said to
[1:08:55] him tell me are you Roman and he said
[1:08:58] yes
[1:09:01] and the chief Captain said with great
[1:09:05] sum obtained I this freedom
[1:09:13] so he paid money to gain his Roman
[1:09:16] citizenship Romana
[1:09:20] and Paul said that I was born free
[1:09:26] we can identify with that
[1:09:29] we don't have to give money we don't
[1:09:32] have to burn candles
[1:09:36] we don't have to have a little thing
[1:09:38] here tell us who we are
[1:09:41] we're washing the blood of the Lambs
[1:09:47] so in uh verse 30 he can't figure this
[1:09:50] out for himself and he wants to find the
[1:09:52] truth so he turns this over to the high
[1:09:55] priest and his
[1:09:57] counselves
[1:10:01] so the Sanhedrin is the high court of
[1:10:04] the land
[1:10:06] [Music]
[1:10:07] it's a group of 71 members
[1:10:12] it's divided into three groups
[1:10:15] the chief priests elders and scribes
[1:10:21] and they were the religious rulers that
[1:10:24] interpreted the law
[1:10:26] [Music]
[1:10:28] they made all the big decisions
[1:10:32] and but they could not issue a death
[1:10:35] penalty
[1:10:37] so the high priest presided over the
[1:10:40] nation's highest administrative judicial
[1:10:42] body and
[1:10:48] um but right below the high priest
[1:10:52] was an exclusive group of about 200 pure
[1:10:56] blooded Jews
[1:11:03] and Below these 200 was another 7 000.
[1:11:09] of ordinary priests
[1:11:13] and all these men could trace their
[1:11:16] lineage right back to Aaron
[1:11:21] and now they were divided into 24
[1:11:24] Priestly Clans
[1:11:28] and so each group served for a week at a
[1:11:32] time
[1:11:35] in the temple so you get the picture
[1:11:40] they were all about structure
[1:11:44] but they were under the watchful eye of
[1:11:46] the Romans
[1:11:49] and only Rome could issue the death
[1:11:52] penalty
[1:11:54] so this just happens to be the fifth
[1:11:56] occasionally
[1:12:01] that all these very powerful people okay
[1:12:07] we're called upon to render decision uh
[1:12:11] regarding the claims of Christ and his
[1:12:12] followers
[1:12:20] to go away yeah
[1:12:23] we can wake up tomorrow it's all a bad
[1:12:26] dreams
[1:12:30] but that's impossible
[1:12:32] why because Jesus Christ was and is the
[1:12:36] Fulfillment of the words of prophets
[1:12:43] and so here we are the followers
[1:12:47] and we will have persecution
[1:12:51] but uh these people fail to see the
[1:12:54] manifestation they can they can quote
[1:12:56] the word they use they use
[1:13:00] we have all kinds of people today
[1:13:02] carrying spoken word books
[1:13:06] we got people in the Congo worshiping
[1:13:09] the picture of the Prophet um
[1:13:12] they give their life for it
[1:13:15] but they're on a Sidetrack they're not
[1:13:17] on the main road
[1:13:20] so these people even though they could
[1:13:22] quote the prophet is
[1:13:25] they were on the wrong side of the issue
[1:13:29] and so um the first time that they were
[1:13:33] called on to issue a uh uh decision
[1:13:38] foreign
[1:14:01] were questioned by the same tribunal
[1:14:06] by what power what name have you done
[1:14:10] this
[1:14:10] [Music]
[1:14:14] and then the apostles were having
[1:14:16] marvelous meetings
[1:14:20] in Acts chapter 5 and it was Cinco then
[1:14:24] there was a trial and death of Stephen
[1:14:26] in Acts chapter six
[1:14:31] so here 20 years after the after the
[1:14:33] crucifixion yeah yeah
[1:14:36] 20 years after crucifixion
[1:14:39] I was facing the same powerful bunch of
[1:14:42] guys
[1:14:46] but it's different individuals in
[1:14:49] individuals but it only got more corrupt
[1:14:52] and more
[1:14:54] arrogantos so in 2230
[1:14:59] on the next day when he would have known
[1:15:01] for the certainty whereby he was accused
[1:15:03] of the Jews he loosed him from his bands
[1:15:07] and the commander and commanded the
[1:15:10] chief of police and all the council to
[1:15:12] appear and brought Paul down and stood
[1:15:15] before them
[1:15:17] as a chances
[1:15:29] so here's so here's Paul on trial facing
[1:15:36] Supreme Court you might say
[1:15:39] and so the scene opens where he's
[1:15:41] standing there in verse 1. and Paul
[1:15:44] earnestly beholding the council said men
[1:15:47] and Brethren I have lived in all good
[1:15:49] conscience before God until this very
[1:15:51] day
[1:16:03] with his opening statement he
[1:16:06] establishes the foundation which is
[1:16:08] honestyles
[1:16:14] so you see God knows that we're not
[1:16:17] sinless
[1:16:20] but he calls us to be honest
[1:16:23] if we say that we have no sin we deceive
[1:16:26] ourselves and the truth is not in us
[1:16:30] so as Paul said before this powerful
[1:16:33] Council
[1:16:36] he can honestly declare I've got a clear
[1:16:39] conscience
[1:16:43] now honesty and clear conscience are not
[1:16:46] the same as Perfection is
[1:16:55] Paul was by no means perfect
[1:16:59] but he was totally
[1:17:02] forgivenado and he was honest about his
[1:17:05] failures
[1:17:07] so after his opening statement
[1:17:13] you know he opened up the the meeting
[1:17:15] and then in a total fit of
[1:17:19] angeros the high priest
[1:17:22] ananias commanded them
[1:17:24] that stood by him to smack him in the
[1:17:27] mouth
[1:17:34] and then Paul remember how brother
[1:17:36] Branham described him yeah
[1:17:44] High Temperance
[1:17:47] sarcastic Jews
[1:17:50] but see God can use anybody for his
[1:17:53] purpose
[1:17:56] we would have never picked him
[1:18:00] but he was totally surprised by this
[1:18:03] and he lost his cooler for a minute
[1:18:31] and then one of the court flunkies that
[1:18:33] was nearby says
[1:18:37] he says um
[1:18:39] are you reviling God's high priest
[1:18:42] is it
[1:18:45] is
[1:18:52] then said Paul I didn't know Brethren I
[1:18:55] didn't know he was the high priest it's
[1:18:57] written in the scriptures Thou shalt not
[1:18:59] speak evil of the ruler of that people
[1:19:02] Hermanos
[1:19:08] but when Paul perceived that one part
[1:19:11] were Sadducees and the other were
[1:19:13] Pharisees he cried out in the council
[1:19:15] men and Brethren I'm a Pharisee son of a
[1:19:18] Pharisee of the hope of the resurrection
[1:19:20] of the dead I'm counting question
[1:19:23] is
[1:19:37] and when he had said this there arose A
[1:19:40] dissension between the Pharisees and the
[1:19:42] Sadducees and the multitude was divided
[1:19:51] say there's no Resurrection nor angels
[1:19:54] nor Spirit but the Pharisees confess
[1:19:55] both
[1:20:00] foreign
[1:20:05] of the Pharisees uh they arose and they
[1:20:09] were striving we find no evil in this
[1:20:11] man but if the spirit of an Angel has
[1:20:13] spoken to him let us not fight against
[1:20:15] God
[1:20:17] um
[1:20:29] and when there was great dissension the
[1:20:31] chief Captain you know the police chief
[1:20:34] fearingless Paul should be pulled into
[1:20:36] pieces he commanded the soldiers to go
[1:20:39] down
[1:20:40] by force take him bring him back to the
[1:20:43] jail yeah
[1:20:56] and the night following the Lord stood
[1:20:59] by him and said be of good cheer Paul
[1:21:01] for as thou has testified of me in
[1:21:03] Jerusalem so must thou bear witness in
[1:21:07] Rome is
[1:21:20] so God is confirming his eternal word
[1:21:24] because in Matthew 28 20.
[1:21:28] I Am With You Always even to the end of
[1:21:31] the world
[1:21:34] these are promises for us today
[1:21:38] many times we're right up against the
[1:21:40] wall
[1:21:42] and we can't see any way out of it
[1:21:46] we just wish it would all go away
[1:21:49] but God has a way
[1:21:53] our God's child he will make a way
[1:21:58] and don't be trying to fall asleep
[1:22:00] because I can I can throw this pretty
[1:22:02] good too
[1:22:02] [Music]
[1:22:06] so God's elect have always been under
[1:22:08] assault
[1:22:11] God's elect I've always been under us
[1:22:13] Allah
[1:22:15] ever since the Garden of Eden
[1:22:18] when Cain got so mad he killed his
[1:22:21] brother
[1:22:23] they simply had a different Revelation
[1:22:28] they believe differently
[1:22:31] and if you look at that story very
[1:22:33] carefully
[1:22:36] Adam and Eve never told those boys the
[1:22:39] whole story
[1:22:43] because it was revealed to uh to do
[1:22:49] the spirit of arrogance cannot stand it
[1:22:52] when there's a least bit of opposition
[1:22:58] the Christians in this world can mostly
[1:23:00] get along
[1:23:04] but the Muslims want Total Domination
[1:23:08] no you see so it's very dangerous
[1:23:12] so if you if you look at all the Jews in
[1:23:15] the world
[1:23:17] they are one part
[1:23:19] the Muslims are 999.
[1:23:23] and they can't stand it that there's one
[1:23:25] part that's not with us
[1:23:30] so the bride is not looking to just get
[1:23:34] along
[1:23:38] but just to live our part of the drama
[1:23:42] and live on us before God
[1:23:45] and he's going to take us home
[1:23:48] now the people that are going to be left
[1:23:50] behind
[1:23:52] and they'll be surprised are the ones
[1:23:56] that didn't begin their Journey
[1:23:57] correctly at the foot of the cross
[1:24:02] God will unfold his plan on schedule
[1:24:08] don't try to figure it out
[1:24:12] just be faithful and be obedient
[1:24:18] and so a long time ago brother Branham
[1:24:20] said uh
[1:24:22] you people with these saw blade tempers
[1:24:30] see it sounds better in Spanish
[1:24:33] because it's a it's an electric song
[1:24:39] and so always spouting out at the mouth
[1:24:42] at somebody
[1:24:47] uh he says be careful
[1:24:51] you'll be guilty if you speak one word
[1:24:53] against your brother
[1:24:57] it's not right
[1:24:59] not just go around tearing everything
[1:25:01] down
[1:25:04] you don't have to stick with knife in a
[1:25:06] man's back to kill him
[1:25:12] you can break his character and kill him
[1:25:15] kill his influence yeah
[1:25:19] and how do you do that
[1:25:21] running your mouth without a filter
[1:25:27] we've all been guilty
[1:25:30] but we're here to remind you you
[1:25:32] shouldn't do that
[1:25:35] and you know over in the book of uh in
[1:25:37] the Book of John chapter 12.
[1:25:41] the the Jews came to to visit Lazarus in
[1:25:44] Jesus Lazarus house
[1:25:48] but they wanted to kill Jesus and kill
[1:25:51] Lazarus again
[1:25:53] look right there in John 12 9 and 10.
[1:25:59] yes so now here we are years later in
[1:26:02] the book of Acts
[1:26:04] in the early church
[1:26:07] and they continue with that same evil
[1:26:10] anointing they want to kill these people
[1:26:14] and so in where we're in 23 verse 14
[1:26:21] and there were more than 40 that made a
[1:26:24] conspiracy
[1:26:28] verse 13 14 okay
[1:26:33] and they came to the chief priests and
[1:26:36] elders and said we have bound ourselves
[1:26:38] under a great curse
[1:26:40] that we will eat nothing until we have
[1:26:43] killed Paul
[1:26:45] is
[1:26:57] now therefore he with the council
[1:27:00] signify to the chief captain that he
[1:27:03] bring him down out of the jail tomorrow
[1:27:04] like he would want to inquire more
[1:27:06] something of him and we will come near
[1:27:09] and we're ready to kill him
[1:27:26] Remos
[1:27:31] and when Paul's sister's son heard that
[1:27:34] they were lying in weighed he went and
[1:27:36] going into the castle and told Paul
[1:27:47] one of the centurions and said bring
[1:27:49] this young man to the chief Captain he
[1:27:52] has something to tell him
[1:27:59] so he took him and brought him there
[1:28:01] Chief captain and he called him to him
[1:28:05] okay so anyway he takes him aside and in
[1:28:08] verse 19 and the chief Captain took him
[1:28:10] by the hand and went with him aside
[1:28:12] privately asked him what is it that you
[1:28:13] want to tell me
[1:28:18] foreign
[1:28:25] to bring him down bring Paul down to the
[1:28:29] council
[1:28:30] to inquire more perfectly but don't do
[1:28:32] it because they are waiting their 40 men
[1:28:35] which abound themselves under an oath
[1:28:38] they will neither eat nor drink until
[1:28:40] they have killed him and now they're
[1:28:42] ready looking for the promise from thee
[1:28:45] yeah
[1:28:48] foreign
[1:29:07] [Music]
[1:29:26] now sit patiently we only got a little
[1:29:28] ways to go there's only 28 chapters in
[1:29:30] the book
[1:29:33] and lunch isn't ready downstairs anyway
[1:29:37] so in verse 23 we say that they prepared
[1:29:40] 200 foot soldiers
[1:29:46] in another 70 on horses
[1:29:50] and another 200 with Spears
[1:29:54] so 470 men in uniforms
[1:29:59] to protect one propheta
[1:30:04] but Paul was also on a horse
[1:30:07] and they were going to take him down to
[1:30:09] caesarea to see Governor Felix
[1:30:13] so the chief of police his name is
[1:30:15] Claudius
[1:30:19] he sent a letter with the soldiers
[1:30:22] to Felix to tell him what the case is
[1:30:29] so they took off in the dark
[1:30:33] and all 470 here they go
[1:30:37] to a place about 40 miles away
[1:30:42] so they stopped to rest
[1:30:44] and the next day 400 went back to
[1:30:48] Jerusalem
[1:30:51] in the 70 continued on Horseback down to
[1:30:54] caesarea
[1:30:57] so look at verse 33 of chapter 23.
[1:31:05] 33. so when they came to caesarea they
[1:31:08] and delivered the epistle to the
[1:31:09] governor and presented Paul also before
[1:31:11] him
[1:31:12] es
[1:31:19] and when the governor had read the
[1:31:21] letter he asked of what province he was
[1:31:23] and when he understood that he was of
[1:31:25] silicia I will hear the government
[1:31:35] when your accusers come here also and he
[1:31:39] commanded him to be kept in Heritage
[1:31:40] judgment Hall
[1:31:41] owed
[1:31:47] so it wasn't exactly jail
[1:31:50] but he was confined with Pleasant
[1:31:53] surroundings
[1:31:57] so chapter 24 verse 1
[1:32:01] and after five days ananias the high
[1:32:03] priest descended with the elders and
[1:32:05] with certain orator that's a lawyer
[1:32:07] named tertullius who informed the
[1:32:09] governor against Paul is
[1:32:30] so five days later here comes the high
[1:32:32] priest with all his you know friends and
[1:32:36] his lawyer Mr tertullius
[1:32:42] and in verse 2 he flatters the
[1:32:44] government with great words
[1:32:50] we have enjoyed great peace and
[1:32:52] prosperity due to your wonderful
[1:32:54] planning yes
[1:32:57] come on
[1:33:00] and we're so thankful yes
[1:33:04] but we have a little situations
[1:33:07] this man here is so they invented
[1:33:10] accusations which are named amount of
[1:33:12] the name calling
[1:33:14] um
[1:33:15] he has profaned our Temple
[1:33:20] now this Roman Governor could care less
[1:33:23] about their religious problems
[1:33:29] but he went on he said but we grabbed
[1:33:32] him
[1:33:33] and we were going to judge him according
[1:33:34] to our laws
[1:33:38] yeah they were going to beat him to
[1:33:40] death
[1:33:41] but your man this Commander better
[1:33:46] took him from us under great violence
[1:33:51] he simply rescued Paul it's implemented
[1:33:55] and so we thought it best that you
[1:33:57] yourself judge this case
[1:34:00] and all the Jews with him said hey man
[1:34:02] yeah you're right Mr turkeys we agree
[1:34:09] so Paul here he is on trial for his
[1:34:12] faith
[1:34:15] standing before angry arrogant religious
[1:34:18] High Council is
[1:34:21] [Music]
[1:34:23] about 57 A.D is
[1:34:28] so Paul uh Felix the governor gives an
[1:34:31] odd to
[1:34:34] Paulo and he permits him to say his
[1:34:37] peace
[1:34:38] so now we're in 24 verse 10.
[1:34:43] and Paul after the governor had beckoned
[1:34:46] him to speak answered for as much as I
[1:34:48] know that thou has been of many years a
[1:34:50] judge in this nation I do more
[1:34:52] cheerfully answered before myself
[1:35:07] because the thou mayest understand that
[1:35:10] there are yet but 12 days until I went
[1:35:13] up to Jerusalem for the worship
[1:35:16] is
[1:35:22] and they neither found in me in the
[1:35:24] temple disputing with any man neither
[1:35:26] raising up the people neither in the
[1:35:28] synagogues nor in the city
[1:35:38] neither can they prove the things that
[1:35:40] they accuse me
[1:35:44] but this I confess to you that after the
[1:35:47] Wake which they call heresy that's the
[1:35:49] way I worship the god of my fathers
[1:35:51] believing all things which are written
[1:35:53] in the law and the prophets is
[1:36:07] so he goes on testifying
[1:36:11] and verse 22 and when Felix heard these
[1:36:14] things having more perfect knowledge of
[1:36:16] that way he deferred them and said when
[1:36:20] lisias the chief Captain comes down down
[1:36:22] I will know the uttermost of your matter
[1:36:26] is
[1:36:39] and he commanded the Centurion to keep
[1:36:41] Paul and to let him have some Liberty
[1:36:43] that he should uh forbid none of his
[1:36:46] acquaintances to minister to him or come
[1:36:48] to visit
[1:36:54] over
[1:37:00] so the government was not interested in
[1:37:01] the fine points of the Jewish religious
[1:37:04] laws
[1:37:09] he was simply protecting God's man of
[1:37:12] the hour is
[1:37:16] from Death by the hands of the most
[1:37:19] religious people on the planet
[1:37:25] Sadducees and the Pharisees
[1:37:29] they knew it all
[1:37:34] and they had the attitude to prove it
[1:37:38] so they're really in a fix here
[1:37:42] so Governor Felix having a better
[1:37:45] understanding of the way of Christ
[1:37:53] he granted an injunction
[1:37:58] and he says when the chief of police
[1:38:00] comes down then we'll we'll have a
[1:38:02] another trial have a nice day
[1:38:09] so a few days later Here Comes Governor
[1:38:12] Felix and his wife Priscilla today
[1:38:16] and so you know they lived there and so
[1:38:19] they invited Paul over for lunch
[1:38:22] and asked him about this Christian faith
[1:38:26] Christianity and you only got to ask a
[1:38:28] preacher one time and he'll give you all
[1:38:30] kinds of stuff you know
[1:38:34] and so he expounded to them regarding
[1:38:37] righteousness
[1:38:39] and Holiness
[1:38:42] judgment is coming
[1:38:44] and there's such an anointing president
[1:38:46] at lunch
[1:38:50] the governor was was uh he was fearful
[1:38:53] and he trembled
[1:38:56] he was moved by the power of God
[1:39:00] by the words of a gospel preacheras
[1:39:05] just like some of us he put it off
[1:39:12] you know he was just about convinced
[1:39:16] you can go now
[1:39:18] I'll call you at a more convenient time
[1:39:23] I've got a lot of things to do today
[1:39:26] I have priorities
[1:39:29] friends it's never
[1:39:31] a better time than right now Amigos
[1:39:36] when God is speaking to you
[1:39:39] when God puts you through some
[1:39:41] circumstances
[1:39:43] he's trying to get your attention
[1:39:47] none of us have any guarantee of getting
[1:39:50] out to our car after a while
[1:39:54] you know people I know people that they
[1:39:56] look good but the Lord
[1:40:02] so when God's pressing you for an answer
[1:40:07] proper time
[1:40:09] you act now
[1:40:12] you know give you one small story from
[1:40:15] Brother Randall's life
[1:40:18] back in 1955
[1:40:21] before a lot of you were even born
[1:40:25] but Hollywood made a wonderful film The
[1:40:28] Ten Commandments
[1:40:29] [Music]
[1:40:33] and some of the people the Tabernacle
[1:40:36] snuck off to see it
[1:40:40] and so they come back and they're
[1:40:42] telling brother Brandon how great it is
[1:40:45] it's a very small theater about the size
[1:40:48] of this church
[1:40:53] so brother Brown said okay I might I
[1:40:55] might just do that so he takes himself
[1:40:58] and his wife and Rebecca which would be
[1:41:00] nine years old
[1:41:06] and so they go down there and they watch
[1:41:09] this four-hour film this is
[1:41:13] and so I'm sure most of you have seen it
[1:41:15] but when the pillar fire comes onto the
[1:41:17] screen
[1:41:21] they did such a good job brother bran
[1:41:24] thought it was real
[1:41:38] it's back down
[1:41:40] so anyway they're leaving the film
[1:41:42] they're leaving the theater
[1:41:44] and they're driving home
[1:41:47] and Rebecca's crying
[1:41:50] honey what's the matter
[1:41:54] and see to her it was almost like a
[1:41:56] newsreel you know
[1:41:59] and so they um uh and so she said well
[1:42:03] but Dad didn't you see when Moses said
[1:42:05] all that's on the Lord's Side come with
[1:42:06] me
[1:42:11] and so of course we're looking at those
[1:42:13] who come with him
[1:42:15] but she was watching the ones that hung
[1:42:17] back
[1:42:19] she said that it wasn't fair
[1:42:23] they were they were thinking about they
[1:42:25] were trying to go
[1:42:28] and so he said let this be a lesson dear
[1:42:32] when God tells you something
[1:42:35] you act now
[1:42:38] when you feel like it
[1:42:41] not when Grandma says it's okay
[1:42:44] I see some tired people
[1:42:53] so in our story here uh the governor
[1:42:55] sent for Paul on a regular basis
[1:43:04] but we never read that Governor accepted
[1:43:08] Christ
[1:43:10] all that he was baptized
[1:43:13] talk about it
[1:43:18] oh I know we know we know a few people
[1:43:20] like that
[1:43:22] each meeting guess what he was expecting
[1:43:28] verse 26.
[1:43:31] he hoped also that money should have
[1:43:34] been given him of Paul that he might
[1:43:36] loose him where have he sent more often
[1:43:39] and communed with him is
[1:43:52] so this went on for two years
[1:43:56] so this thing of money under the table
[1:43:59] didn't start Mexico
[1:44:05] doing it clear back there
[1:44:07] is
[1:44:09] and so when the governor's term came to
[1:44:12] an end
[1:44:16] and so here comes another Governor to
[1:44:18] take his place
[1:44:21] but Felix being a great politician
[1:44:26] he left Paul as a prisoner
[1:44:30] in order to please the Jews and make
[1:44:32] himself look good yeah
[1:44:38] see with some people it's all about
[1:44:40] appearance
[1:44:43] put on your best clothes and come to
[1:44:45] church
[1:44:47] see God can see you all through the week
[1:44:52] he hears the attitudes
[1:44:56] and so what some people it's all about
[1:44:58] appearance but very little substance
[1:45:03] and God Demands a correct order of
[1:45:06] priorities
[1:45:11] Christ always has first place
[1:45:16] Martin Luther the fifth
[1:45:20] messengero he said Christ Alone
[1:45:35] so anything that comes between you and
[1:45:38] God is an idol okay
[1:45:43] and so we're going to stay with what our
[1:45:46] Prophet said
[1:45:48] as he expounded the scriptures to us
[1:45:52] see because we have these we have these
[1:45:55] these uh these spoken word booklets you
[1:45:57] know
[1:45:59] this isn't something way far away
[1:46:02] this is only the Amplified version of
[1:46:05] the scriptures
[1:46:07] together perfectly yes but we got people
[1:46:11] today burning candles to the to the
[1:46:13] books and the pictures
[1:46:16] we come right around Catholicism again
[1:46:21] okay so we got plenty of time we're
[1:46:23] going to go into last three chapters
[1:46:26] 25 and one
[1:46:28] now when Festus has come into the
[1:46:30] province after three days he ascended
[1:46:32] from caesarea up to Jerusalem
[1:46:35] Jerusalem
[1:46:41] so fastest is the new governor
[1:46:44] then the high priest and the chief of
[1:46:46] the Jews informed him against Paul
[1:46:48] comparison
[1:46:53] and desired favor against him that he
[1:46:56] would send for him to Jerusalem laying
[1:46:59] in wait to kill him
[1:47:06] so of all the things going on in Israel
[1:47:10] this is the first order of business
[1:47:13] they're going to inform the new
[1:47:15] government about this prisoners
[1:47:19] serve with all due respect
[1:47:23] please bring this sorry preacher up to
[1:47:25] Jerusalem
[1:47:28] and the governor says in verse 4 no no
[1:47:31] he'll remain in my jail in caesarea
[1:47:33] Festival
[1:47:37] I'll take care of him so after 10 days
[1:47:40] in Jerusalem he goes back down to
[1:47:42] caesarea
[1:47:44] so they had a trial in verse 7.
[1:47:47] [Music]
[1:47:50] and when he was come the Jews which came
[1:47:52] down from Jerusalem stood around about
[1:47:54] and laid many Grievous complaints
[1:47:56] against Paul which they could not prove
[1:48:06] well he answered for himself neither
[1:48:09] against the law or the Jews neither
[1:48:11] against the temple nor yet against
[1:48:13] Caesar have I offended any at all
[1:48:25] but Festus near the new governor willing
[1:48:28] to do the Jews a pleasure answered in
[1:48:30] Paul and said will you go up to
[1:48:32] Jerusalem and uh there be judged about
[1:48:34] these things before me
[1:48:36] um
[1:48:45] and Paul said I stand at Caesar's
[1:48:49] judgment
[1:48:52] where I ought to be judged to the Jews
[1:48:55] who have done the wrong as you very well
[1:48:58] knows
[1:49:02] for if I be an offender or have
[1:49:04] committed anything worthy of death I
[1:49:06] refuse not to die but if there be none
[1:49:09] of those things uh were of these accuse
[1:49:11] me no man can deliver me into them I
[1:49:14] appeal to Caesars
[1:49:25] is
[1:49:47] so the new governor says that um uh you
[1:49:50] know I mean then King Agrippa you know
[1:49:52] came to welcome the new governor
[1:49:57] and Festus rehearsed the whole story
[1:49:59] with him
[1:50:03] in verse 22 and Agrippa said to Festus I
[1:50:07] would like to hear from myself tomorrow
[1:50:09] uh and he said tomorrow you will hear
[1:50:11] him
[1:50:18] and so let's see verse 23 on the next
[1:50:21] day when Agrippa was come and Bernice
[1:50:23] with great pomp they were entered into
[1:50:25] the hearing place of hearing with the
[1:50:27] chief Captain's principal man of the
[1:50:28] City Festus commanded Paul was brought
[1:50:31] forth is
[1:50:43] and fester said the governor says to the
[1:50:46] king and all men that are here present
[1:50:49] with us you see this man about whom all
[1:50:51] the multitude of the Jews have dealt
[1:50:53] with before me both at Jerusalem and
[1:50:55] also here crying uh that he ought to not
[1:50:59] live any longer
[1:51:14] but when I found that he had committed
[1:51:16] nothing worthy of death that he himself
[1:51:19] has appealed to Augustus Caesar I have
[1:51:22] determined to send him
[1:51:32] and uh
[1:51:35] and of whom I have no certain thing to
[1:51:38] write so he's you know said I I don't
[1:51:40] have anything I can't send any any
[1:51:42] letter you know so you you check him out
[1:51:44] see what you think about it
[1:51:52] and so in verse 1 of 26 then Agrippa
[1:51:56] said unto Paul that were permitted to
[1:51:57] speak for thyself then Paul stretched
[1:51:59] forth his hand and answered for himself
[1:52:10] I think myself happy King Agrippa
[1:52:13] because I shall answer for myself this
[1:52:14] day before thee touching all the things
[1:52:16] where I'm accused of the Jews
[1:52:28] especially because I know that uh they
[1:52:31] need to be an expert in all customs and
[1:52:33] questions which are among the Jews
[1:52:35] wherever I beseech thee to hear me
[1:52:37] patiently
[1:52:41] questions
[1:52:47] so he starts to tell his story and go
[1:52:49] down to verse 14
[1:52:52] can you tell us about the encounter with
[1:52:54] the Lord on the way to Damascus
[1:53:00] when we were all falling to the earth I
[1:53:02] heard the voice speak to me saying in
[1:53:04] the Hebrew tongue Saul Saul why
[1:53:06] persecuted on me it is hard for thee to
[1:53:09] kick against the Pricks
[1:53:21] and he gives him the whole story you can
[1:53:23] read it later
[1:53:25] verse 22 having therefore obtained help
[1:53:29] of God I continue unto this day
[1:53:30] witnessing both the small and great
[1:53:32] saving not saying none other things than
[1:53:35] those that were prophets and the Moses
[1:53:37] did say which that should come
[1:53:41] up
[1:53:52] you see that's the same thing William
[1:53:54] Brandon said
[1:53:57] he's brought the word to us
[1:54:02] and so the message back then in verse 23
[1:54:04] that Christ should suffer he should be
[1:54:08] first they should rise from the dead and
[1:54:11] should show light unto the people and to
[1:54:13] the Gentiles
[1:54:22] so he gives him this the whole gospel
[1:54:24] tells his whole story they got plenty of
[1:54:26] time
[1:54:29] and in verse 28 then Agrippa you know
[1:54:32] the king said to Paul almost that
[1:54:35] persuaded me to be a
[1:54:42] Christiano at the time of Paul's trial
[1:54:44] on caesarea
[1:54:48] it was not a crime to be a Christian
[1:54:50] when standing before the Roman Court
[1:54:56] they all agreed that Paul was innocent
[1:55:00] but after spending two years in the
[1:55:02] prison
[1:55:04] he was sent off to Rome
[1:55:07] and his journey was not a pleasure
[1:55:09] Cruise
[1:55:12] they had a lot of problems
[1:55:15] and we're not going to go into all the
[1:55:17] problems but you need to read verses
[1:55:19] chapter 27 and 28 for yourself
[1:55:23] because they had they had all kinds of
[1:55:26] problems see today you can fly from from
[1:55:29] Tel Aviv to Rome in about three and a
[1:55:31] half hours
[1:55:37] I had no motor
[1:55:40] either Road or With the Wind then
[1:55:45] and this this boat could be a hundred
[1:55:47] feet long it is
[1:55:53] carrying 300 tons of grain to Rome
[1:56:14] and uh yeah we're not going to give you
[1:56:16] all the details but he did get there
[1:56:20] and he was under arrest for about two
[1:56:22] years
[1:56:25] during this time Nero had a lot of
[1:56:27] problems
[1:56:29] and so they let him lose for a while
[1:56:33] and from First Timothy 1 and Romans 15
[1:56:39] it's reasonable to think that Paul went
[1:56:42] to Macedonia and also to Spain yes
[1:56:48] and then he was rearrested
[1:56:52] and at that time all the big cities like
[1:56:56] like Rome had a wall around him
[1:57:12] somewhere outside the wall
[1:57:14] one one day in the year 67.
[1:57:19] Paul was beheaded
[1:57:24] now we think of that as real bad and
[1:57:27] very inhumane then someone says
[1:57:32] but it was instant death
[1:57:34] we got all these people laying over here
[1:57:36] in the hospital in the Rest Homes pills
[1:57:38] and more pills
[1:57:43] so anyway that's what they did back then
[1:57:45] and today there's a beautiful church
[1:57:47] outside the walls
[1:57:50] there's where Paul is buried
[1:57:54] foreign
[1:57:56] will be there in about 30 days
[1:58:00] so the actual end of Paul's life is
[1:58:03] unknown but
[1:58:08] all the details are here in the Bible
[1:58:10] that we need
[1:58:12] his letters to his people they became
[1:58:15] scripture
[1:58:18] so that'll be the end of our study in
[1:58:21] the book of Acts
[1:58:23] do you have any questions write them out
[1:58:28] either language
[1:58:33] gracias amen
[1:58:47] all as well
[1:58:51] amen did you enjoy
[1:58:54] that journey through your own life
[1:58:59] amen when we look at this we realize my
[1:59:02] brother and sister were not reading
[1:59:03] history
[1:59:07] the revealed word
[1:59:09] for our day
[1:59:12] amen and everything that God put down in
[1:59:15] record
[1:59:17] for you and I
[1:59:20] to have now this might seem a strange
[1:59:23] way to put it
[1:59:26] but for you and I to have Advantage
[1:59:32] we get to see exactly what Satan's plan
[1:59:36] was
[1:59:40] now I just look at this real quick as as
[1:59:43] Paul is there
[1:59:49] God wants him to be able to speak to
[1:59:51] those people on the island
[1:59:55] he's bit by the serpent uh
[1:59:59] he shakes it off
[2:00:02] and they say this must be a God
[2:00:07] but follow me
[2:00:09] you've been bit by the serpenters
[2:00:13] you have shaken it off
[2:00:16] because God is in you
[2:00:20] and they said well you make yourself God
[2:00:23] and brother Branham says this is
[2:00:27] not too far off
[2:00:31] amen so we are the word living today
[2:00:35] and that word living in US is
[2:00:39] shaking off the bite of the surface
[2:00:42] Hallelujah
[2:00:47] Hallelujah aren't you glad today
[2:00:51] aren't we so glad today
[2:00:54] amen and you know you look at this and
[2:00:57] realize you know what we're going to
[2:00:58] give our life Saints
[2:01:00] we give it now we give it later it's our
[2:01:04] order give our lives I say Lord I want
[2:01:08] to give my life to you
[2:01:10] and I want to thank you Lord for the
[2:01:13] life you are giving us

[2:01:19] a little oh yeah
[2:01:21] you know you look at this something that
[2:01:23] struck me as brother George just a few
[2:01:25] words
[2:01:29] the accuser keeps coming before the
[2:01:32] throne
[2:01:37] Paul did this Paul did this
[2:01:40] and Paul's response was
[2:01:43] prove it
[2:01:47] and the accuser is Before the Throne
[2:01:49] today
[2:01:52] before the father today
[2:01:56] guilty they're guilty they're guilty
[2:02:01] blood of Jesus Christ
[2:02:08] and we should be able with confidence
[2:02:10] today
[2:02:14] Satan prove it
[2:02:17] you won't find one drop of evidence
[2:02:21] to bring before God
[2:02:24] that we're guilty
[2:02:26] thank you for the blood
[2:02:34] Hallelujah I tell you I'm just excited
[2:02:37] my brother and sister

[2:02:49] now don't you ever let someone say to
