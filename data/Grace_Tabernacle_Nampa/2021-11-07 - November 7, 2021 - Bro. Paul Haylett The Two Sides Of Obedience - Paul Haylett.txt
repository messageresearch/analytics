that we are in communion with you born of your spirit and living a life worthy of the gospel by your power we now commit all these things to you for your glory and honor in thy name the lord jesus christ amen just a couple of quick announcements just want to make here november 13th which is this coming saturday as most you know lord took for the elmer that while their home they'll be having a celebration of life at the nampa first church of the nazarene at ten o'clock so that'll be this coming saturday and then also let's not let's be in prayer and let's not forget this evening at five

858 came across this song this morning hello how many know the song perfect you have a second special [Laughter] all right hopefully somebody would know because always when i get to the second verse i

was burned today heaven came down [Music] [Music] oh [Music] praise he can problems [Applause] [Music] now [Music] there is and it's because of that wonderful day when at the cross i believe rich is is [Music] [Music] was one more time and [Applause] [Music] i [Music] heaven came down isn't that beautiful amen heaven truly has come down hallelujah it's uh interesting i just early this morning i was uh in my studies just looking at that and that song in my studies this morning would have went perfect together but uh just good to be here this morning can we say amen to be in the house of the lord today i just want to remember those that are not with us just as we're sitting there thinking about brother pershant sister akoncha all the way down in california just believing that the lord would just answer their prayer and uh i just remember brother prashant telling me one time he said brother paul he said i i just like to be free from you know the confines of the green card work visa uh you know just like to be free to be able to just go where our hearts are to to live where our hearts are and so let's be faithful to remember brother prashant's sister concha that the whole visa the whole thing it's interesting now uh this will sound political but i just want you to just catch how the spirits of the day are so here is brother perchant uh just incredible in his knowledge you know i remember one day we're sitting there and he's talking about how brother paul i said break it down real small for me brother personally so i can understand it he says brother paul we'd take a grain of sand and give it memory okay that's that's small enough for paul paul can do that so none of the sand that i deal with has any memory at all but anyway let's just remember them and it seems a paradox right a man who's contributing to the economy and to you might say technology and knowledge that's in the world today is on such a constraint but um pardon me for putting this way i don't mean to just be funny but i've seen a little a little meme or whatever four guys all dressed up and they said we're gonna go to mexico and sneak back into the united states so that we can receive all these things from our government and uh it just is a paradox right a man contributing can't hardly become legal but they're offering legality to anybody and everybody that wants to sneak in so let's lift them up in prayer so i might not get brother dan's name right sister kristin might have to speak it out for me but our brother dan rubelke ruboki um him and brother rodney brander was here a few wednesday nights ago and uh they're you know down in in phoenix and they were traveling come in those of you is here that wednesday it was good to see them and uh i have especially fond memory of uh brother dan in the sense that he takes copper wire and he twists it up and makes little things out of it and he had gave me a little uh scorpion that he had rolled up out of wire and it's just a beautiful little thing very artistic but we were visiting and um in the foyer and we were talking and i made a comment and he says well brother paul uh it was actually another poem that he says you know fit with what you said tonight and then he shared this and if brother mason will put that poem uh up on the screen i i just thought it was uh just a beautiful thing uh that i wanted to just share that with you and uh i know there'll be those of you that have already read the first paragraph but um we'll just go ahead and read it to you amen the words effect now let me just bring this to you the word was intended to have an effect on us correct not for us to read it and forget it but it was meant to be life-changing it was meant to for us to stop and say that applies to me thank you lord oh and that is whether it's correcting you or just simply blessing your soul we say thank you lord and so this had a a lovely effect upon me as i was reading it and then brother dan ended up giving me a copy of that the words effect things are said in such a way to cause some to go and some to stay some will look and never see god's unfolding mystery what's required to be god's wife is it the truth or is it the life amen if we live in the word and the word lived in us it's a living epistle all can trust our lives in journey we can see from mortal man to theophany word on word outlives transformed back to the mind of god we are conformed the life of our sacrifice on display she is he in this day we have walked through time and time is done omega god at the evening sun she's fully dressed for all to see she's pure she's white she's heavenly amen amen part of this struck me because there will be a portion of what we're going to speak this morning that will fit right in line with this my brother and sister because you see in the day that we're living we look and we say well you know people are not seeing this word or they see portions of it or they want to conform it to themselves but remember the prophet of god showed us so clearly that the spirits of the ages have never died they are here everyone that they dealt with through the ages is right here in the day that we live in and having the same similar effect so when a spirit was sent forth uh and released and it went out to anoint people to whether it be murder or whatever it might be that spirit today has still been released affecting people causing them to dwell in that same realm so you'll see now that as the spirits are moving through the day god when he brought up and placed and set it in order and our lord jesus come now as the reflection of the manifested body of christ uh of god in the day and walked among us right it says the word was made flesh everything he said in order my brother and sister you can say well he was speaking to the sadducees and the pharisees he was speaking to the spirit he didn't pick a certain man and say like i'm speaking to you he was speaking to the spirit and so as it is that same word that was spoken then has come right down in full manifestation into the day that we live in and is dealing with the spirits of our day so therefore we have to have we need no hesitation to take that word and say lord it worked then and i'll apply it today just as it was applied then because you see the word that loosed those spirits and set men and women free were there again not dealing with the woman at the well not dealing with this one not dealing with that one it was dealing with the spirit and so it was the spirit of life the spirit of god in them the spirit of christ if you want to put it that way in them that he was speaking to and so as that same spirit lives in full authority and power today the word is still speaking to the very spirit that is in you and i amen as sons and daughters of god the holy ghost is coming still stirring still moving still calling still drawing and still working amen and so we deal in this realm of the spirits we often times look and we get caught in the realm of the flesh and we think well it's this person it's that person stop stop stop that person delivered of that spirit the man in the tombs they didn't know how to deal with him when he went back home it was easier to deal with him as that crazy man and then isolate him but what happens when that man comes back in to their very midst to his very home his very street and starts talking about the power of the man called jesus and they themselves not believers they still had to put him in the box and isolate him so the difference of their isolation was not of whether he was insane or whether he was delivered the isolation was actually of their own creation they either received or rejected based upon their own thoughts and their own ideals and their own does that make sense well let's just stand and go into the word this morning i want to speak to you thank you brother jason sister emmy sean appreciate that amen i missed heidi i thought i thought she had a spot right over here on the corner but i was mistaken amen uh let's learn in our bibles the two sides of obedience we want to look at this this morning and i pray by god's grace i can articulate it to you to realize the two sides of obedience and we'll turn in our bibles to acts the fifth chapter starting with the 25th verse amen her lovely reports of the uh are our young people's participation in i don't know what do you call that uh junior hammers but is that a recital is that a performance whatever it is just hear a lovely report of the beautiful music and uh just uh thank the lord for the talent that god has placed in our midst and uh my i hope you don't mind but i'm still waiting for those that were singing this special at brother sergey and julia's house here recently to um appear in church amen acts the fifth chapter the 25th verse amen so what we're looking at here is uh we'll focus as it were and i'll use peter as a reference point uh to just keep it concise so here we see that peter they're acting upon the word upon the commission given them and they've been preaching and and those in the community in authority didn't like that and you know had them thrown in prison and uh you know they're going to silence my brother and sister they're going to do their very best to silence what god is doing in a humanistic way so we want to silence them we'll throw them in prison we're going to silence the move of god we're going to put a halt to the move of god in our day by beheading killing burning doing all of but they don't realize see they can't catch the understanding that the move of god is not a flesh and blood thing it is god himself moving in the midst and so now they've thrown him in prison and we'll start here in verse 25 he says then came one and told them saying behold the men whom he put in prison are standing in the temple and teaching the people imagine the confusion they had look we turned the key we know they are locked up they're silenced but now they're suddenly standing in the temple then with the captain with the officers and brought them without violence for they feared the people lest they should have been stoned and when they had brought them they set them before the council and the high priest asked them saying did we not straightly command you that ye should not teach in this name and behold you have filled jerusalem with your doctrine and intend to bring this man's blood upon us then peter and the other apostles answered and said we ought to obey god rather than man that's a pretty strong when you really think about those words a pretty strong rebuttal to what they've been told the god of our fathers raised up jesus whom ye slew and hanged on the tree and him hath god exalted with his right hand to be prince and a savior for to repentance to israel oh where we at here yes okay we are witnesses of these things and so also right hand to be prince and savior for to give repentance to israel and forgiveness of sins and we are his witnesses of these things now i want you to key in on this what they're declaring is is we have not come in our own name we have not come in our own authority we've not come in our own program we simply came as witnesses and i pray today that we could as a little group of believers this morning say we are here as his witnesses amen of the power of the saving grace of our lord jesus christ amen as a healer and i believe we can lift hands and say yes witnesses of healing a witnesses of deliverance witnesses of provision witnesses of every promise that there is amen we are his witnesses of these things and so also the holy ghost whom god hath given to them that obey him so now we look at this and i don't want to preach this but i just don't want to skip over this key point the holy ghost now in this scripture is very much connected as being given to those who obey there's not another avenue doesn't say to those who made great donation a great give a great amount of time uh whatever it would be it's to those that are obedient amen so when they had heard that they were cut to the heart and took counsel to slay them and they stood there up one in the council a pharisee named camille a doctor of the law and had in reputation among all the people in other words well respected and commanded to put the apostles forth a little space and said unto them ye men of israel take heed to yourselves what that you intend to do as touching these men look at this for before these days now what does he do saints he doesn't tell him by opinion he doesn't tell him by the law of the church but he brings them under anointing to real life experience now if i was to ask you just a simple question this morning do we really believe that god is a healer now why would we do that we have in us a desire to believe the word but see the mercy of god he can take it right back to experience we are a people of experience god didn't say just blindly follow me although by faith we would blindly follow him does that make sense by real true faith in the word we would just follow him because he said so but god is gracious knowing we in our humanity and says i'll give you experience ever been in a situation where maybe you felt bound that song you know some midnight hour if you should find you're in a prison in your mind i believe we can all say we've been there and i want to ask you by experience is he a deliverer see we can stand upon that so now we'll see that it's there that gamil is i didn't pronounce that right i even listened on the internet ten times the pronunciation of his name and i still can't get it right just like our brother but he gives an example for before these days in other words in the past rose up thudius boasting himself to be somebody to whom a number of men about four hundred joined themselves now you think about that four hundred throw in some wife throwing some kids that's a pretty good-sized church join themselves who is slain in all as many as obeyed him see the two sides of obedience here we're scattered and brought to naught after this man rose up judas of galilee in the days of the taxing and drew away much people after him he also perished and all even as many as obeyed him were dispersed and now i say unto you refrain from these men and speaking of the apostles and let them alone for if this counsel oh look how god includes them drew the circle not around peter and the apostles but included the very counsel into this judgment to me i find it so remarkable amen for if this counsel or this work be of men it will come to not but if it be of god you cannot overthrow it lest happily ye be found even to fight against god and to them they agreed it made sense right he is speaking as one respected a voice that they are willing to submit to do you catch this they obeyed him and to him they agreed and when they had called the apostles and i love this way of getting your point across and beaten them we want you to know that our church has the right spirit so as you leave our church our group we're going to beat you just so you'll know it's of god i've met them people they commanded that they should not speak in the name of jesus christ and let them go and they departed from the presence of the council rejoicing oh saints i hope we have this spirit rejoicing that they were counted worthy to suffer shame for his name and then you can see how well they obeyed and daily in the temple and in every house they ceased not to teach and preach jesus christ heavenly father we just ask for your leadership your guidance today lord how gracious you are to us how loving how kind how faithful lord when i just think as the song says when i think of the goodness of jesus father my heart would take that in another chorus when i think of the patience of jesus when i think of the love of jesus and truly your goodness father we thank you for that and ask for your leadership your guidance today speak to the hearts of your saints lord those who are not here today i pray your holy spirit just move around surround them father and stir hearts and fill us lord with your presence lord not just your presence that would fade away but the enduring presence of our lord jesus christ which is the holy ghost to go with us and lead us every day we love you lord thank you now in the name of jesus christ amen you may be seated saints now as we would look at this my brother and sister we would want to just kind of take a little stroll uh through this scripture and uh i must admit you know this whole um this whole time change is is um was kind of nice but it had me very confused as i'm wandering around the house with my coat on and my bible laying there and sister han is like we're leaving right now and i looked at the clock and it's like yeah in just like an hour real soon real soon so you know i got a little flustered this morning you know because just it seemed like my internal clock was off but we'll just ask the lord to just come down and and kind of calm our spirit and and be able to uh uh uh go into the word um and so i want to just go back into the scripture uh and uh i want to tie in uh at verse 28 if the brothers would take us there and we would see my brother and sister uh of what is happening uh in this so it's there that the these apostles they throw it in prison and um it isn't so much that these men were there but i want you in verse 28 to look at this saying did we not straightly command you in other words they were not asking for obedience they were demanding obedience that we told you not to speak not to preach not to do this and uh that you should not teach in this name see they wouldn't even name the name and behold you filled jerusalem with your doctrine you you have done this but my brother and sister if we'll go back and let me just kind of touch upon your memory the prophet of god said it's not so much what we say as what we do so i have to believe that going into this scripture that the life of jesus christ was moving through jerusalem after as it were his death and burial and resurrection and his ascension the life was moving through jerusalem and what frustrated the pharisees is there's nothing they can do about the life they can lock people up in prison and the life is still there they can do everything they want to do the life is still there and my brother and sister we live in the day that we live in and how the strong spirit of religion is upon the land but the life my brother and sister is still living and is still in demonstration regardless of what is done and so you know we look at this and they said you know we told you not to do this you filled jerusalem with your doctrine and intend to bring this man's blood upon us oh my brother and sister we'll look in just a minute and delve deeper into this but it's there that we have to understand that the very intent uh and the reason i was confused trying to tell you i kind of got almost two sets of notes and some are here and some are there and they're speaking of the same things and and i i kind of needed to reconcile those but i started well anyway anyway anyway anyway but you look at this see so it's there that that they are saying you know what you're you're intending to bring his blood this man's blood upon us but you know that is the very reason of the preaching of the gospel is to bring the blood of jesus christ upon mankind amen so it's there that there is a push back we we we don't want we don't want this blood upon us we don't want to to be partakers we don't want to have the responsibility and uh you know peter in them i'm just gonna go over this and we'll hit it again kind of coming back and they answered and said you know what we're gonna obey god rather than men so what you have commanded just kind of went in one ear and out the other what you have said you must we must do is not applicable to us you you might be speaking to mere mortal men you might be speaking to the carnal man but we are of a higher calling we are of a priesthood and we are going to follow the calling in our life regardless of what you think and so it's in that realm that uh obviously these men very high authority and uh they they don't want to uh have men telling them we're not listening to you because they're used to the instantaneous obedience now my brother and sister we'll look in the world today and we don't have a time this morning uh as it would be very drawn out in the world today there is conformity not conversion so we have to be very careful that we're not conforming what we're looking for is a true conversion amen we don't want to conform to the gospel of jesus christ we want a conversion to the gospel of jesus christ and too many people spend and this i don't mean to speak in a negative aspect this morning but too many people spend too many years of their life conforming to the message and come to a place in their life they can no longer empower themselves to conform but there's no foundation no conversion there to hold them and when they give up on the conforming they're gone but catch this now they just move to the next stage and conform to something else no child has been born that says i want to disfigure my body it's a conforming i love this i hope you have a sense of humor this morning but i love this you see these young men with their pants hanging down and their bloomers hanging out over that and i don't know they must use a safety pin or something to keep them things up but you know they walk like this with their knees out otherwise their pants fall down and they say this is my identity as they walk with 25 others who look just like them you see that's not a real identity that's a conforming now i believe that was brother donny reagan that said one time and if it wasn't brother i know it was brother donny i said you know if god had called you sisters to go and you're in the grocery store store and you got hair about as short as mine and you were called to have purple hair and you know green eyelashes and this and that and tattoos all over you if that's what god called you to do the devil would have you here in a long skirt with long hair yeah do you catch the point he's making see regardless of what it is god called you to do the devil is going to come and anoint or cause them to conform to something different so to me i remember you know thinking about that i thought isn't that right it doesn't matter what it is that the word of god is called the devil will be there to anoint to conform to something else amen so you look at that and and you see now i want to and as i said we'll touch on this again real quick here but verse 32 uh he says you know we're witnesses of these things now my brother and sister uh there's no two witnesses see the exact same thing right many years ago there was a bank robbery here in town and um you know they they uh this is when they first started to separating the witnesses to things like this and so they took these people that were in the bank and uh it happened to be my banker that was robbed but they they separated them and then they asked them individually now this robber um what did he look like and some said well it was this way and some said now get this some said he's wearing a button-up shirt and some said he's wearing a t-shirt and some said he had white tennis shoes on and some said he had blue tennis shoes on and and you do this but as the police through experience took each one of these people's deals they would find that out of the 12 people or whatever number it was if you follow me uh they said well you know what there is six of them said he had blue tennis shoes on and there's so many said that he had not a shirt not a button-up shirt but he was wearing a certain color t-shirt and they start doing that and because of the preponderance of the evidence they start putting together an image of this individual and so it's there you think well 12 people saw a man with a gun standing in a bank it would be clear that you should be able to say blah blah blah he wore this and he wore this and he wore this and he wore this and maybe even somebody would say oh he was packing a glock but witnesses were saying things like he had a shiny gun in his hand okay that'd be good but the police are getting this all together they're figuring this out they're starting to get a profile this story has a interesting twist to it because there was a man who come up to the police line at the bank and a policeman there told him he said uh sir you have to stand back we're dealing with a robbery and he says can i talk to you we don't have time to talk to you and they just kept pushing him back he kept staying there patiently finally the policeman goes up there okay what do you got to say well sir a man in a blue gray t-shirt blue jeans blue tennis shoes jumped into a chevy chevelle with license plate blah blah blah and drove away and the police are like why didn't you tell us that before i tried to they look it up deputy drives the house in middleton and waits down the street till the man pulls in his own driveway and arrests now my brother and sister are one that's the way the devil works right but you see these witnesses here every one of them sought a little bit different does that mean there's conflict in the scripture no sir i want to ask you today is jesus christ been present in our lives present in this church do we all have the same witness but it's a true witness because it's our witness of jesus christ in us amen otherwise we would only need one recipe as it were because we would all be exactly the same so you see these witnesses and they're declaring also the holy ghost is a witness whom god hath given to them who obey so placing a very high evidence he could have said yep nope the holy ghost is also a witness but you see they're making a declaration to come down to our day to be a true witness of jesus christ now this is not to say the world out here has not witnessed and not been blessed by god but to be a true witness of jesus christ you need the holy ghost see we can talk of what god is doing we can talk about this you know and and uh you know these things and i don't want to sound judgmental but they have an experience but they have to deny the power of the full experience or they would be converted and jesus said we've got to hide it from them lest they would see and be converted thank you lord for predestination amen never take it lightly don't sit here with a frown on your face i'm not saying anybody is but just don't sit here with a frown on your face and say oh me my poor life i want you to come to a place that the witness of jesus christ in your life is enough to cause you to lift a hand and say thank you lord no matter how difficult my life is the very fact that i can be a true witness of jesus christ is a blessing that's been placed upon my life something's been released into my life that i can stand in this position and so it's there my brother and sister we see as i said in verse 28 this expectation of man's obedience to man's command amen see sometimes these commands are outside of the word of god but people still expect obedience to that the leadership expects obedience even if it's outside of the word and so we have to come and there's a time if i could quali uh quote it or put it this way uh and i i might preach on this anyhow even though i'm bringing it up right now uh the quiet rebellion amen you see what's happening in the bride today my brother and sister we're seeing riots in the cities we're seeing all kinds of young people mostly speaking out pushing back against the government pushing back against all of these things they're not a quiet rebellion my brother and sister the quiet rebellion is the one who does what is necessary to produce what they're called to produce these have a spirit of destruction just watched a clip this took place back east i believe south carolina young people coming to a fast food joint and when they left there they operate the person in there is calling 9-1-1 you can hear it in the background yes yes there's people here tearing up our deal and then the person hangs up the phone and just moves in the back and they totally destroyed everything in that place but you see the bride of jesus christ is having a quiet rebellion and she's walking according to the word and the spirit of this age right the god of this evil age is anointed the world to be in such a fashion but here is the bride walking counter to every command of the god of this evil age she is in her own world in her own realm under her own anointing because she's a witness of the spirit of jesus christ which is a spirit of restoration amen a spirit of restoration the prophet of god says is not replacement amen it's restoration we always were in him hallelujah so we don't have to come and try to make ourselves be something because he promised to restore us back so our quiet rebellion against the spirit of this evil age is us standing with the word of god just as we see these apostles right here standing and saying you know what sorry but we are going to go and their actions spoke of that and they went and uh uh continue to preach the gospel now look how this is they're concerned they don't want the blood of this man upon them look how spirits work the two sides here one not wanting to be judged you know that's what what's interesting how the blood works every one of us is judged the very blood that we stand and confess confess has washed us from our sins judged us now i'm not trying to make a doctrine out of this i hope you follow the idea this blood comes down upon you and i and it judges sin in our life as unworthy for who we are not that we're unworthy it's judging the sin as unworthy for who this is you see the blood cannot take sin away from the sinner unless there's something deeper there a deep calling into the deep a life a predestination if we want to just cut to the chase amen so sin will not be taken away my brother and sister from the atheists from the heathen from those that denounce and curse god will never be done but god comes and he puts blood over you and i and says this is my son this is my daughter and they're not worthy this blood this sin is not worthy to be upon them and he removes that delivers us from that now we can take that and you say brother paul you're preaching that kind of counter type but i preached a counter type on purpose my brother and sister for you realize it's god who took the sin away and if he said you're worthy of the sin that is upon you i'll just leave it there we're lost but he looked at that sin and says no i will take that sin upon me brother jason i just had he didn't realize this was part of my sermon we joked about it but yeah i'm going to take this sin upon me amen i'm going to take it into me because this sin is not worthy to be on my bride that's a counter typed a way to preach it saints but i hope you catch did you catch it amen so they're not wanting to be judged and one is wanting to be judged isn't this amazing we see in the world today the spirits that are out there and even around the message people are like i i don't i didn't like what the preacher said he was judging me no he wasn't no he wasn't that word was and so one doesn't want to be judged at all so any reference to life circumstance behaviors attitudes is you're judging me but the counter type of the two sides of obedience one is declaring judge me lord judge me and if there be any fault any failure in me lord please lord come i ask you in the name of jesus take it from me cover it with your blood so what are they doing they're inviting the blood and one is saying oh you're trying to put his blood do you catch that one is saying you're trying to put his blood on us and one is saying lord pour your blood on me i want to be in your blood lord i want to be washed i know that this is my avenue to be washed whiter than snow lord i want your blood upon me and one is saying you're trying to put his blood upon me and i reject that oh look at the spirit of the day that we live in saints what is happening i would say a message believer should never bring from his lips i believe the preacher was judging me it should never come from our lips we should be there saying lord i want to be judged i don't want to be shamed none of us want to be shamed right none of us want to come to church and be shamed but i tell you under the right spirit would come to church and say judge me judge me let the word be preached if there be error in me lord if there be weakness or failings or whatever lord i've been tarnished by the cares of this life lord then just wash me judge me lord so you see those two sides those two spirits but look at how this is the two sides of obedience both are obedient to the anointing upon them i could take that much deeper lord leeds will we'll come back preach on that a little more but you see both are obedient to the anointing you see under satan's influence do everything they can to turn everything into religion you catch that because religions are covering all we want to do is be covered just cover me cover me cover me now that phraseology to a real believer is an entirely different meaning in other words the scripture says that we cannot even declare jesus the christ without the holy ghost so when we are here saying cover me what is that saints that's us pour the blood on me lord pour the blood on me lord amen i submit to the word i say forgive me lord forgive me of my shortcomings forgive me of the lust of flesh the pride of life forgive me of this forgive me whatever it might be lord forgive me because i want to be covered now i tell you just go look it up you'll find several times through history brother brown saying i feel so religious right now now my brother and sister to people that are the hard-liner as it were that all religion well what are they going to do with that you know why they have a problem because they don't understand what he's saying what is that song maybe remember this sister emmy would play it at the end of the service cover me when i am hallelujah when i'm triumphant i'm bold when i'm a conqueror no cover me when i'm weak cover me when i'm tired cover me when i'm afraid cover me when i have done wrong cover me amen so satan come and says you know what i'll what i'll do is just put them in a religious spirit they'll feel covered i don't want to feel covered saints i don't want you to feel covered i want you to be covered amen we don't want to just acknowledge there's the blood of jesus christ we want that blood on us and some men say no no i don't want that blood on me oh no i do i do amen why they don't want accountability you know what saints it's hard right we have our issues come on let's let's be men and women enough to just admit we have our issues amen we have our our little times that we speak out of turn and we are offended and we have a little attitude and we what come on let's just admit that but you see we're also men and women enough as sons and daughters of god to take accountability to go back and say i was wrong forgive me i was wrong lord forgive me the first wrong was to husband wife parents children whatever lord forgive me i want accountability you see some men's sins go before them and some men's sins follow them and i want the accountability of when i stand there one day if it was that way and my sins and my life were read i want them this is just my own little rendition to you and he lied and another voices under the blood he stole under the blood he lusted under the blood he this he that under the blood under the blood under the blood under the blood under the blood under the blood and maybe another individual would come the same things but no voice declaring accountability and one hears well done my good and faithful servant you see all of these things that were read from that list if it was that way and he comes and says well done my good and faithful servant why because saints let me just make it very simplistic it's a little deeper than this and you know that but here we are whatever it might be in our life and the holy spirit moves down and we're like i was wrong lord forgive me now it's not going to get under the blood by us sitting here and saying okay lord i acknowledged i'm wrong will you put it under the blood no sir you have to pick it up you have to bring it over here and you come on can i get that you have to put it under the blood amen god provided the blood you have to provide the willingness or submission to place it there isn't that beautiful amen thank you lord that we're anointed right now look at this in john 9 and 41 move forward brothers if you would please john 9 and 41 we look at this now i've just preached a little bit or referenced this here recently jesus said unto them if you were blind now he's not talking about natural eyesight because right before this they said are are we blind do we not see yeah if you're blind you should have no sin now think about this a man or woman living wherever it might be in the world that never hears the gospel of jesus christ it never comes to their ears the name of jesus never passes their lips and god says i'm going to judge you but in all honesty in all fairness what is he going to judge them of something they never knew jesus tells him if you were blind you should have no sin never saw one thing never never had a clue you have no sin but now ye say we see therefore your sin remaineth now i'm going to change this if you'd be kind enough to let me when we would say we see we are really saying we believe i see this i believe so what happens is when we say we believe when we say we see the gospel of jesus christ we're then taking accountability to ourself and saints we have a choice to take this our iniquity our unbelief we have a choice do i take it over here and put it under the blood or do i just put a covering over myself i'm a message believer look let's not look at the denomination let's bring it down home i'm a believer i believe god sent a prophet my brother and sister that doesn't change the fact you've got to take your sin and iniquity and bring it over here and put it under the blood amen it is not just because we confess that we believe because you see if we were entirely blind then god would give grace to us in our circumstance i'm not here to determine what god will and won't do but god would give grace to you but we are here saying we see we see we see we believe now we have this accountability now look at the true believer amen that's where we really always want to look right to the true believer look at the true believer they want the blood now the prophet of god said we backslide daily do we believe that now some of you that are nice and mellow and not high strung and not nervous and not massively in debt so you have no worries not a care on this earth no i think i'm going to believe the prophet's words and he said we backslide daily now some of the back signs might be bigger than others remember the little lady that brother branham talks about and she got delivered and then she's walking down the street one night and and she knew better than to stop at the door of that honky tonk or dance hall but she just remembering old times isn't amazing how we can reminisce in old times and then she stopped right there and then next thing she knows she's looking in the door and next thing she know she's inside and next thing she knows in arms of some boy and when she sees the prophet again she says i'm lost i failed i'm done it's finished and he says no it's not it's not because you see while she failed the anointing may have been more on the ins outside of her than it was on the inside but god said i know how to get it to the inside now you say why do you say that brother paul because she didn't run and hide from the prophet she went back to him and said this is what i've done i don't know how i did i i just the prophet didn't say you worthless no good lady no sir he says look your first mistake you stopped and listened what was it that was a bible that was inside there it sounded like music it sounded like laughter it sounded like joy and happiness but it really was just the devil because the devil knows how to impersonate amen and he creates this atmosphere so it's look the the true believer wants the blood look how they're attracted to the blood i'm talking to true believers this morning am i not amen attracted to the blood that when we come short and holy spirit deals with us we don't run away from the blood we run to it amen every time oh it's hard to admit especially as we get older that we still make these mistakes but look at what god's doing he takes us he's appointed us we go right back to the blood and you realize when you're going back to the blood you're actually telling god hold me accountable well i mean otherwise my problems that i have as a man are not really my fault their brother jason's fault come on have you ever done that well let's get it right down where it usually happened husbands wives well he wouldn't fight i wouldn't fight but you're fighting and fighting is really not an issue you know that i don't even think fighting's an issue that just shows we haven't really learned how to deal with it god help us to learn you know sister jerry there's a lot of things and i don't say this in lightning to make her look bad a lot of things that she says i must have a red button on my forehead and there's things that she's just like now what results would she expect vice versa what she really should expect is someone who's got the blood on them see you thought i was speaking on jerry i'll just turn it around she shouldn't push the button but just because she pushed the button i don't have to react wrong god help us families husbands wives children we don't have to react that way we are as it were in a sense as sons and daughters of god in control of our destiny amen you called me a what thank you you know how hard that is to do you called me a what god bless you you did what well i'm sure that there has to be a reason because god's in control when's the last time you use that one come a little closer i'll slap you silly as more common response come on saints let's look at this in the correct deal you see the real believers attracted to the blood the real believer is willing to be held accountable by the blood amen and a real believer is identified in the blood now let's just go look right here in the token amen the the believing worshiper was identified with his sacrifice by the token i don't wish to stay too long on these little quotations but which you could take the entire service on one of them but i want to stop here for a moment to express that the believer had to be identified with his sacrifice so here is the priest in the temple declaring we don't want his blood on us you know what they were saying i never saw him as the lamb he never was a lamb to them so therefore the blood became offensive where the believer recognizes that christ is our sacrifice our lamb and we know that not only do we want that blood upon us we want to handle our sacrifice and so look at this now the believer had to be identified with his sacrifice see if it's just a sacrifice and made somewhere out there he had to give it but he had to be identified in it frankly he had to place his hands on it first to identify himself with his sacrifice and then the blood was placed where he could stand under the blood the blood must be over him and that was a token that he had that he had identified himself guilty isn't that amazing one of the first things we got to do as a believer i backslide daily i won't put it on any of you i will use you for an example i backslide daily you know the first key things of me backsliding daily is i have to acknowledge and speak out i'm guilty now i'll bring this back and here again i'm not meaning to slight sister jerry i'm trying to break that habit i don't care if she was as mean as a junkyard dog and i got angry and i did i can stop and say the reason i got angry is her fault but did you know that when you go lay your hands on the lamb the lamb doesn't say you confess it and i'll forgive her the lamb says you confess it i'll forgive you now for us to confess it saints what do we have to do i'm guilty lord i'm guilty lord i have transgressed the word of god i am guilty lord we have to make that acknowledgement we have to bring that to identify ourself with our lamb yes we can't have that remote nature that we live in right we live in a world today wait till they come down to the time that brother trevor is the recipient of some of this incredible technology brother trevor will be sitting up there in the house and sister carrie will be making him a cup of coffee and a customer will walk into the barber shop and sit down in the chair and there will be 42 cameras in that room and brother trevor will be watching all these cameras and he'll look at this and the profile of the head or the history of the head of that customer will rise up and the camera will identify and little things will pop up there and then brother trevor will say good push the button no no no and the man slides his credit card and walks out while brother drinking some coffee and eating a croissant i want you to think about that silly example in the world of religion brother brown said the lord spoke to him and said all that you love all that you ever loved and loved you will be there and people are going well praise the lord i'll sit right down here in my little chair and that prophecy to be fulfilled now i love brother branham i'm going to be there and religion comes to him a little here and a little there and a little this way a little that way no effort on their own no altar to plead at no sacrifice of their self-will no change of nature they're counting on this kind of you might say shortcut but in that shortcut there's no laying their hands on the lamb they're counting on someone else to lay their hands on the lamb but the word declared they had to lay their hands on the lamb but at the flip side of this now there'll be some people that will look at the word hear the word believe the word something stir in their heart and they'll be saying lord jesus come close to me come nigh to me lord you are my lamb and i must possess you i must have you i want my life to be changed i want to be judged by the word if brother paul preaches so hard i walk out of church crying in myself pity i want to say oh lord i receive that and those are the ones my brother and sister that never get offended they never walk away they never say i won't go to that church they're too hard they're never doing that because they'll look at that and say that wasn't that man that man loves me that man would never do this to me that's the holy ghost rooting out the little plants the little foxes but he had to place his hands on it first to identify himself with his sacrifice then the blood was placed where he could stand under the blood now brother branham says i don't remember what sermon it is brother adam says the devil can't get to you if you stay under the blood amen hallelujah so what does he do he gets placed where he's under the blood this is not clever writings my brother this is not clever preaching this is god speaking to you and i let's stay under the blood get under the blood stay under the blood and our lives will not be filled full of chaos and whatever of this tormenting devils of the day that doesn't mean your tire won't go flat it doesn't mean your car won't run out of gas if you don't stop and refill it and but then again we have testimony coming out of africa of missionary brothers driving the gas station they were counting on was closed they're in the middle of nowhere they just said lord you know why we're here you know what our purpose is lord you know what our whole intention was and uh they get in the car and start it and drive for hours till they're back to their home go out the next morning gonna drive their land rover to the gas station and the tank boom it won't start i wouldn't suggest you go do that weekly because you're too lazy to stop at a gas station the blood must be over him that was a token he identified himself guilty and he proven that innocent substitute had taken his place now my somebody quickly turned the clocks back we're going to do daylight savings times too so they got to be identified in the blood now look let me just hurry we're going to look at first peter here peter an apostle of jesus christ to the strangers scattered throughout pontus galatia cappadocia asia and bithya elect according to the foreknowledge of god i love this scripture actually tell you the truth elect according the foreknowledge of god the father through sanctification of the spirit unto see god's not gonna have a rebellious bride oh is she going to rebel against the command and spirit of laodicea the god of this evil age yes she can't even hear his voice unto obedience and sprinkling of the blood of jesus christ grace unto you and peace be multiplied blessed be the god and father of our lord jesus christ which according to his abundant mercy hath begotten us again and to a down sided depressed poor is me no it's all saints come on i'm speaking to paul too so don't worry about it that spirit that moves through the land is the he's devil to steal the joy from the bride of christ well if this had gone different i guess i'd be happy if this was this way i'd be happy your name is on the book that in itself ought to be enough for us to shout and sing oh won't we have a time remember the last time brother jewel was here he sang that i got a mental image drilled right in my head a brother jewel up here oh we have a time when we get over yonder yeah you know why it's real he's not putting on a performance my goodness he's almost died two or three times here had strokes and had you know minor heart attack this and that and all this stuff and you call him up and he can barely talk and he's saying praise god brother paul the lord is with me what oh brother jewel no talked to him on the phone the other day you know he blitzed through town what we got it was a god bless you and tell the saints hi that was that's what we got but my brother and sister here's a man it's like praise the lord brother paul the lord's lifted me up again and again and you came amen now you sit here and say woe unto me you need to go catch that spirit you need to go catch that spirit has got us again into a lively hope by resurrection of jesus christ to an inheritance incorruptible undefiled that fadeth not away reserved in heaven for you who are kept by the power of god my brother and sister don't sit here and go woe unto me of my circumstance you are being kept by almighty god through faith unto salvation ready to be revealed in the last time now look at this my brother and sister we're living in the last time are we not amen so it's there in this last time god's revealing these scriptures right here wherein you greatly rejoice though now for a season if need be you're in heaviness through manifold temptations none of us i think like to be tempted right but there's two sides of obedience here saints it's not the trial you know what can somebody acknowledge that it's not the trial it's what you do in the midst of the trial that matters you can speak faith or you can speak doubt and fear you can say god's with me or you can declare god has abandoned you two sides of obedience he says we're kept he says we're gonna rejoice in the midst of these trials manifold temptations that the trial of your faith i struggle on this one saints i'll just be honest with you that the trial of my faith being more precious than that of gold that pairs though betrayed with fire might be found into praise and honor and glory at the appearing jesus christ there's times that satan sets the stage on closing there's times that satan sets a stage and he lets you just have a stub your toe just figurative here stub your toe then you trip you fall down you get up you hit your head when you're getting up and then you walk a little ways and you realize oh this isn't where i wanted to go and you have to backtrack and you turn on another path and that path you don't remember it's so difficult and we think man the devil's just pounded on you no what he's doing he's setting the stage for his real assault amen all the rest of this in military terms is just a probe how is it have you ever noticed saints when we have little struggles in our life when we won blame it on someone else or to feel like god's not hearing us i know some of you well enough to know that you have declared that before i don't think god's hearing my prayer i'll just speak for the rest of you and the devil's watching his spirit a little lower than it was yesterday a little lower than it was the day before a little lower a little lower than the devil approaches but you ever noticed god moves in your midst your heart's on fire and the wheels fall off the wagon and you say praise god there'll be another wagon coming praise god there's something better the lord has for me praise god satan you're already defeated even if you're trying to you know the devil never quite has the same effect when you tell the devil that now pardon me for saying it this way but when you tell the devil that he is an ugly liar and i'm not even going to listen to you it has a different effect though when he whispers in our ear and we say yeah you're right you're right nobody loves me you're right i'm no good you're right i'm unworthy the devil's like yes yes but what about we just throw a little curveball at him but satan is unworthy as i am i think i'm just going to go find me a place and curl up under the blood and he's like i've wasted weeks on this person i put all this time i knocked the wheels off their wagon and i did this and i did that and they're gonna go climb under the blood and say lord forgive me for my fears my doubts my the devil is like wow come on saints we're going to have a little practice of our warfare amen we're kept now look at this whom having not seen you love in whom though now you see him not yet believing we just hold on we're believing nothing's going to turn us away how can you do that well it's god in me let me put it into a different term i got some quotes if i had just piled them on today i could bring to you you can come in that position because your hands are not on religion your hands are not on church your hands are not on our preachers so revelated your hands are on the lamb amen and there's no way satan can shake you loose when your hands are on your sacrifice when he is right there so personal hallelujah you got your hands on the lamb satan's like i can't even get to him what am i going to do now well praise the lord satan that's what the whole plan is what are you going to do now see we can rejoice with joy unspeakable and full of glory receiving the end of our faith you see our faith is not going to come short of our faith get this now saints your faith is not going to bring you to a rapture you know that ponder that for a minute your faith is not going to bring you to a rapture your faith is going to bring you to the throne of almighty god the rapture is just a sequence of time and event that takes place and people i hear it all the time well if we can just hang on to the rapture sorry hang on to the rapture nothing man there is a spot before the throne of almighty god that has my name on it i'm not just wanting to make a rapture i'm going right on through the rapture and right after the rapture my brother and sister is the marriage of the lamb and right after the marriage of the lamb is the millennium i'm i'm going to transfer all the way through all of that and step in that and be living right in the very presence of my lord jesus christ not just looking to make it another day now if some of you are in this position financially please forgive me for putting it this strongly but people have a way of living they spend their money they live their life that way and they spend their money that way that they pick a projected point in time and they think if i can just make it till the next payday if i can just make it to this if i can just make it to that my brother and sister the fault of their thinking is they'll never break the cycle because their expectation is i have this money and if i can just make it right there but the man as it were that has a savings account that has built up through the years is the man who says i am looking to this point way off here do i need this sure enjoy things of life absolutely enjoy things of life but if you have to choose between good stewardship and yourself choose good stewardship amen hallelujah so here let me finish i'm so lost in my own notes i don't even know where i'm at well praise the lord i like it when i don't preach from notes once again i want to remind you of that beautiful verse 38 for if this council or this work be of man it will come to not you know we have well brother paul we have this problem in the message over here and we have this doctrine over here and we have this thing that happened over there and no no no don't look at that look at the word now i want to ask you a question is the word not more powerful in your life today than it was a year 5 10 ago is it not more real today than it was at any time in your past is it coming to naught is what i would put to you is the word coming to not where you feel less inclined to believe or act upon the word my brother sir if we're in that position we need to find an altar and if you need a quote i've got to quote if you come to that place we need an altar see this should be refining us this refining fire is refining us in our faith to stand on the word of god to trust the lord he says i believe amen so this council is not coming to naught but look now the prophet of god said these two spirits would go side by side right down to the end so this spirit here now this is going to sound judgy hope it's not judging to any of you can you look out saints even amongst the holiness groups i have for years now looked at listened to have my own reason my own purpose why listen to it of the preaching of the pentecostal world in the holiness world there has been a steady decline hallelujah steady decline saints i don't mean to speak personal but brother brown told us that you can look at the wives the sisters in a church and know where condition of a church is when we're in needle skirts and high heels when we're in tight blouses when we want our hair to grow more for the glory of god so we're going to trim off our split ends why don't you just ask god to trim off your split ends i know a sister i met her sister one time that was her testimony she had really long hair all the way down on her bottom but her hair was just getting ragged it was horrible and she went and all the hairdresser and all the people was like nope you have to cut it and she's like i ain't cutting it she started getting down something smoked her heart she started getting down and saying lord you gave me this hair and it looks horrible lord even though i'm going to wear it this way for your glory because your word says so and she started doing that and then one day her hair started growing again and a miracle happened and she didn't have split ends any longer you see the devil's alternative was yeah i know you're a believer but this is the solution no the word is the solution prayer is what changes things not reasoning not a hairdresser not of this or that it's the word and so see how satan's coming because he says i have an alternative obedience for you and it makes sense i will preach that in another service that's what i'll do i'll just preach that portion another service is it saints an obedience to redemption and an obedience to judgment the two spirits in the framework of the church sister emmy will you come amen you see my brother and sister this word is not going to come to naught because it's god's word and when man's expectation doesn't meet god's word then we don't go with man's commandment we go with god's word so what we want to do today saints is we want to just exercise this judgment of the holy spirit now this judgment of the holy spirit i'm speaking in this sense and that is how many of us pray for wisdom amen it doesn't matter if you go through you know three thousand dollars a month on a paycheck or you go through a hundred thousand dollars a month or something in a business or whatever i believe any of us that have any we're praying for god's wisdom lord i want wisdom now my brother and sister when we constantly apply that to our life that prayer that attitude then would we not expect god to give us wisdom on what we give our allegiance and our obedience to see now the scripture says and boy does this open up a can of worms be so close that's it come on think about it saints so close to deceive the very elect and i've had people that were just like oh brother paul and they literally almost in tears because you know we we just can't we can't we're going to be deceived like what bible what quote are you reading if [Music] if it were possible they said well brother paul that almost borderlines on arrogance you're saying you can't be deceived praise the lord i'm glad you got the message i'm glad you heard what i was trying to say because i can't be deceived because paul is so smart so intelligent so educated so no sir because i've been obedient to the word and i have christ in me and the prophet of god makes this statement the holy spirit will never lead you away from hallelujah so the whole solution here now i say this in all kindness so don't nobody misunderstand this brother david preaches a lot about getting the holy ghost and i say amen because you have the holy ghost you can't be deceived that's god himself speaking through you it's not of high attainment you know if you're a mormon then we've got a lot of mormon relatives and some of them i've had some connections with through the years now if you want to be a mormon you start off taking care of the young men and then you move into this you that then you get invited to the council in your local ward and then when you're gifted and you speak well they offer you more and they offer you more and they offer you more until you have attained a position [Music] the holy ghost said if you'll die daily i'll lift you up i don't need your ability i don't need your thoughts i don't need any of that you just die come on this time come on saints can we just die today just die a little bit more to ourselves today just give up a little bit more and say lord thy will be done [Music] i want to be completely obedient to your word lord i don't want to be part obedient i don't want to be a little bit obedient i don't want to be three-quarters obedient i want to be obedient the fullness of the extent of the word i want to be obedient lord because as i surrender you have promised to lift yourself and that's our heart's desire today saints amen i'm sorry i jumped around a little bit today like i said i just i struggle you talk about that proverbial phrase about pandora's box you just open the word and you start looking and it's like oh my i'll include this scripture i'll include this quote and then pretty soon you're like you know that's probably five hours so then you spend an hour putting this back and putting that back but you don't want to lose quotes so you got to then create another file and start storing them over here and and it just takes time so i'm sorry if i kind of spoke a little notchy this morning i was trying to trim my thoughts down to remind you [Applause] the two sides of obedience i believe we're sitting here today as sons and daughters of god because we've already chose that sign we've already lifted the word up we've already declared lord you say it i want to believe it i want to act on it i want to be obedient to it hallelujah you know it reminds me a little story in closing can i share this the cleverness of humanity of the devil reminds me of a little story boys over there cookie jar got his hand in the cookie jar and the mom walks in the kitchen and she said johnny get out of that cookie jar don't you dare have a cookie before supper so john's like yes mom right after supper and everyone who went in the living room and sat down tony just almost the cookie jar again without permission and in his mind it's after supper i'm not breaking the rules [Music] and it's so funny because in this little story johnny has a cookie out of the cookie jar [Music] everything's going well he remembers i've got to put the lid on the cookie jar or else mom will know i'm in the cookie chart he reaches over with a cookie in one hand a lead to the cookie jar in the other and he's so enthralled with his cooking he has to take a bite of this cookie his ill-gotten gain his disobedience and he misses the cookie jar and he drops the porcelain lid on the floor would it not been better though said mama you said after supper [Music] would it not been better to have submitted if mom said no to do it the scripture says whatever we've done in secret would be made whatever is done in the darkness shall be revealed in the line let our obedience saints let our obedience you want a new car ask god for it don't just do it ask god for you want a different house ask god for it need a change in your life ask god for it don't think that god will have i left the quote out i sort of product that's all i'm going to speak it out to you prophet of god says [Music] i believe it's in the oneness it could be mistaken because sometimes you look too many you do something in the perfect will of god goes wrong god will help you fix it but if something goes wrong and you're out of the will of god you have to go back and get in the will of god for god to help you obedience saints is better than sacrifice amen hallelujah how many loves the lord today oh my you know i borrowed so much time from you saints through the ages that one of these days i'll just have to go to somewhere let somebody else redeem that time amen let's stand up sing a song or two for the lord i got so many songs here on my page as i as i was just coming along this morning that i don't know amen open my eyes that i might see amen that's what we're desiring today [Music] yes [Music] help me brother james hallelujah and this would be a sermon right here wouldn't it [Music] i'm going to start with the chorus baby [Applause] [Music] what's the other one no no this is the one [Music] speak this from your heart today [Music] [Applause] [Music] i wait for thee [Applause] ready my god [Music] [Applause] my [Music] is [Music] fall on my ears [Music] silently now i [Music] oh [Music] spirits [Music] [Music] gladly [Music] [Music] love [Music] [Music] silently now highway [Applause] [Music] open my [Music] hallelujah when our eyes are open saints [Music] obedience becomes a much clearer picture [Music] sometimes saints we don't really like to recognize it in these terms and i don't want to be offensive but we come to one of the greatest battles many of us fight is this is what i want lord and we don't really spend time to ask the lord what he wants [Music] be still and know that i am god saints i'm telling you the time is coming i had something shared with me the other day [Music] can i just have a moment that's something shared with me the other day i come from a position of what i would call great authority [Music] and when you look at that the influence that these things have on people [Music] when you look at influence anyone has on those around us [Music] people sharing quoting quotes building a foundation quotes this is what you should do um and in that you can look at that first off and say you know what that's exactly right that's exactly right i'm struggling to find the scripture excuse me [Music] as i was reading this it troubled me saints troubled me very much someone using quotes using a position of authority to encourage people don't do this do this giving quotes to support it i went to bed that night i was praying i said lord i know i don't believe what was spoke right there i have also i study a multitude of quotes that i believe would repudiate that would would neutralize that as it were but i want to tell you saints how powerful something can be when you ask god lord i want i want you to show me i don't want paul's opinion i don't want to just declare from my past experience this is what it must be but how about when we would come to a place and you would get up early in the morning and you'd sit in your chair and your bible that you normally study out of and read has been closed so it's not where you've been reading and you reach over and you pick that bible up and it falls open to judges 18. and in judges 18 we see the children of dan and we see micah backslid and he takes to him molten images he takes to him idols he's backslid [Music] and he hires himself his own personal levite that will speak to him what he wants to hear i won't go into the whole detail because it would require quite a time but i tell you i know what was on my heart saying to know what i was praying and as i read that i thought oh god we're coming to a day as it was with dan as it was with micah we're seeing the spirit rising up and people now understand saints i want you to go to the church that you feel blessed in i never want you to feel like brother paul's trying to keep us here it's got a leash on us no no i don't believe that i don't believe that but i'm telling you we're coming to a day when people are looking out and they're hiring themselves a preacher to preach what they want to hear and then they're raising up images and idols and then they come and say this is what we believe i'll just tell you from my heart right now i believe god supernaturally took me to judges 18 to answer that very thing that was shared with me god i pray this for you saints for myself for my family don't fall under that spirit i will sit in a church that preaches what we like to hear let us pray and ask god lord let it be preached what i need to hear not what i want to hear saints please powerful forces the devil hates this message he wants to rip it to shreds don't look at anybody and say oh they're bad this is that no no no don't do that but i encourage you to pray lord lead us lead us lord into obedience lead us father that to your word is still our absolute as the prophet declared it to be lead us to these things father and then give us a spirit to surrender ourselves to it because you see my brother and sister it's one thing to drive down the highway limit sign 55 that's all right it don't apply to me i drive any speed i want [Music] now you'll find the natural and the spiritual parallel to each other now the word says i shouldn't but [Music] that applies to you not me what is that an idol it's an idol raised up that's exactly right well brown said we can become a denomination unto ourselves i just want to encourage you saints go back to the pure word pray over it lord reveal to me make this real to me not because paul preached this brother david preaches brother chris preaches make it real to me lord because i want your word and then lord give me a spirit to be obedient to that word hallelujah how great are you lord [Music] oh just worship him saints how great is your mercy how great are the things that you have [Music] how great are you lord your loving kindness is filling my heart as i sing how great are you lord how great is your love it reaches to [Music] great is [Music] how great is your mercy [Music] how great are the things that you have done for me [Music] how great are you lord your loving kindness is filling my heart as i sing how great are you lord how great is [Music] again [Music] how great is your love for it reaches to the heavens how great is the hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah i'd like to just close on a lively little note if you don't mind amen a declaration i'll tell you what i don't embarrass sister sue [Music] sister seuss went through a lot of a lot of trials a lot of tests through the years i remember a day like it was yesterday she's broke up over circumstances she makes a declaration brother paul i've come too far now to give up i have come too far now to quit i'll tell you sister sue that testimony it burned itself deep down in my soul it's like that is absolutely the truth come too far no matter what satan can say or circumstances might surround me i have come too far amen well i've got my mind made up and i won't turn back hallelujah i wish that little brother from south africa here to sing it for you you guys would be wowed he put so much heart so much depth into that thing i remember i was just like oh lord that young boy believes exactly what he's a singing here what he's approaching through song he has got his mind made up praise the lord he's still serving the

must fight [Applause] what's up [Music] [Applause] i'm [Music] [Applause] hallelujah aren't you glad god let you make up your mind hallelujah such a supernatural influence we are not a double-minded
