[40:43] lady
[40:44] knows what faith is and she knows that
[40:48] if those around us are weak we don't
[40:51] step back and say oh too bad for them we
[40:55] bind our faith with them amen we're
[40:59] going to rebuke you Satan that you would
[41:02] take your hands from this little boy May
[41:04] the septic infection be taken away May
[41:07] healing come and if the Lord tarries may
[41:10] this young man rise up to be a great
[41:13] warrior for our Lord Jesus Christ amen
[41:16] because Satan my brother and sister the
[41:19] prophet shows us so clearly it comes a
[41:21] day that we have to exercise our faith
[41:24] and put Satan in his correct position if
[41:29] we give him a seat at the table
[41:32] you know my brother and sister do you
[41:34] guys ever fuss on the way to church
[41:37] now I see some of you you got a little
[41:40] smile on there but you're not nodding
[41:42] your head and you're certainly not going
[41:43] to lift your hand
[41:44] [Music]
[41:46] but do you know the reason that we fuss
[41:48] on the way to church is because we let
[41:49] the devil get in the car with us
[41:54] and we had him kicked out of the car
[41:55] before we ever came to church we
[41:58] wouldn't arrive at church walking in the
[42:00] door feeling like oh my how can I
[42:02] worship I just fought with the wife or I
[42:06] just fought with the husband or I felt
[42:08] like pulling over the side the road
[42:09] sister Jerry knew a family when she was
[42:12] young
[42:12] the dad had a great big paint stick
[42:16] stir stick and he'd drive down the road
[42:18] wouldn't he be paying attention where
[42:20] he's driving he just couldn't wait to
[42:22] correct those kids long enough he'd turn
[42:24] around just start wailing on them how
[42:27] about we do that to the devil
[42:29] amen let's not bring him to church let's
[42:31] not give him that opportunity to get us
[42:34] all stirred up right if our hearts are
[42:36] clear then we have confidence in God and
[42:38] I want to come to church with confidence
[42:40] amen listen stand and let's go into this
[42:44] my God is an awesome God hallelujah
[42:48] our God is an awesome God and He reigns
[42:54] from heaven above with wind some power
[43:01] and love our God is an awesome God oh
[43:07] who are gone
[43:09] is an awesome God and He reigns from
[43:14] heaven above with winds some power and
[43:20] love our God is enough
[43:24] now make it personal
[43:26] my God
[43:28] is an awesome God and He reigns from
[43:34] heaven above with wind
[43:38] with some power and love my God is an
[43:43] awesome God let's give some praise to
[43:46] the Lord
[43:47] Hallelujah Lord we're so thankful today
[43:51] Lord to raise our voices and declare to
[43:54] the world you are awesome you are
[43:57] awesome Lord our God is an awesome God
[44:01] hallelujah thank you Lord Jesus thank
[44:04] you Lord Jesus amen
[44:07] the Saints in Johannesburg
[44:10] desire your continued prayers amen that
[44:14] the Lord would just lead them and guide
[44:16] them
[44:17] sister Kathy
[44:19] a couple broken vertebrae I was just
[44:22] interacting with brother kobus her
[44:25] son-in-law and
[44:26] he said in the condition that it is
[44:28] right now that this will probably
[44:30] without God touching it will affect
[44:32] sister Kathy the rest of her life you
[44:36] know a little bit of limitations of
[44:37] those vertebrae that were broken
[44:40] my brother and sister I serve an awesome
[44:43] God
[44:44] I serve a god that is a Healer he said
[44:47] I'm a Healer and I believe him amen I
[44:49] have no reason to question and say now
[44:52] why wouldn't you what we need to do is
[44:54] come without hesitation amen without
[44:57] doubt and say my God's A Healer and not
[45:01] settlement amen so I just ask you to
[45:04] lift them up amen communicating with
[45:06] some of the brothers there and deacons
[45:08] and whatnot they're just pressing
[45:10] forward but they certainly need our
[45:12] prayers because life has changed and
[45:14] changed pretty drastic for the church so
[45:17] just lift them up amen I want to speak
[45:20] to you once again on things that are to
[45:22] be thank you sister
[45:25] amen our musicians
[45:28] and it lovely we have such talent in the
[45:31] church that God's raised up amen and we
[45:34] appreciate that talents that God has
[45:37] given amen things that are to be the
[45:40] prophet of God preached a lovely sermon
[45:42] on that and you know he didn't cover
[45:44] everything
[45:45] uh inclusive he he did not say now this
[45:49] is what you have to look forward to he
[45:51] just barely scratched the surface of it
[45:53] but my brother and sister one thing we
[45:55] have the promise of things that are to
[45:57] be is that whatever is written here
[46:01] is ours we don't have to say well you
[46:05] know we'll be able to make it without
[46:06] some of this coming to pass my brother
[46:09] and sister God ordained it he spoke it
[46:11] we just need to believe it amen I want
[46:14] to speak to you today on the thought the
[46:16] elect lady her righteousness is not her
[46:20] own amen and I'm glad to say that that
[46:23] we do not have righteousness of our own
[46:26] uh amen because that would rise and Wane
[46:32] it would be good seasons
[46:35] and yet every one of us if we would lift
[46:37] our handset
[46:38] I come to a dry season one time
[46:42] maybe you're in a dry season right now
[46:45] does that mean that your righteousness
[46:47] in Jesus Christ went away no sir
[46:50] no sir amen well how does a subject kind
[46:54] of a little bit I had so many titles I
[46:57] had almost a page scribbled out of
[46:58] titles that I put to this and I
[47:01] scratched that one out and I want this
[47:02] one I want that one I even resorted to
[47:05] asking sister Jerry what do you think
[47:08] amen we won't go there
[47:11] amen Romans the fourth chapter
[47:15] starting with the 13th verse very
[47:17] familiar scripture to us
[47:19] amen speaking of Abraham
[47:22] the promise that God had given
[47:25] my brother and sisters we look at this
[47:27] we realize that everything that was
[47:31] written in the Bible was for us the
[47:35] Bride of this day amen God didn't put a
[47:38] start in a stop God didn't put a season
[47:40] and say you know what my word is
[47:42] effective for this period of time and
[47:44] then it's no longer effective but this
[47:47] word fits our day and I trust that God
[47:50] would bless us today amen for the
[47:53] promise that he should be heir of the
[47:56] world was not to Abraham or to his seed
[48:00] through the law but through the
[48:02] righteousness of faith for if they which
[48:06] are of the law be heirs faith is made
[48:09] void and the promise made none affect
[48:14] because the law worketh wrath for where
[48:17] no law is there is no transgression
[48:20] therefore it is of faith that it might
[48:23] be by grace that the end of the promise
[48:25] might be sure to all the seed all the
[48:29] seed not to that only which is of the
[48:33] law but to that also which is of the
[48:37] faith of Abraham who is the father of us
[48:40] all as it is written I have made thee a
[48:43] father of many nations before him whom
[48:47] he believed even God who quickened the
[48:50] dead and calleth those things which be
[48:52] not as though they were
[48:55] I'm here to tell you today Saints every
[48:57] one of us have things in our life which
[49:01] are not but we have been called to stand
[49:04] as they were Amen in other words don't
[49:09] sit down on the job
[49:11] because you see things in your life not
[49:14] matching amen believe that God has made
[49:18] you more than able amen hallelujah who
[49:23] against hope
[49:25] believed in hope that he might become
[49:27] the father of many nations according to
[49:30] that which was spoken so shall thy seed
[49:33] be and being not weak in faith he
[49:36] considered not his own body now dead
[49:40] when he was about a hundred years old
[49:42] neither yet the deadness of Sarah's womb
[49:46] he staggered not at the promise of God
[49:49] through unbelief but was strong in faith
[49:52] giving glory to God and being fully
[49:55] persuaded that what he had promised he
[50:00] was able also to perform therefore it
[50:04] was imputed to him for righteousness now
[50:07] was not written for his sake alone that
[50:11] was imputed to him but for us amen also
[50:16] hmm can we get an amen out of that thank
[50:20] you Lord but for us also to whom it
[50:23] shall be imputed if we believe on him
[50:26] that raised up Jesus our lord from the
[50:29] dead who was delivered for our offenses
[50:32] and was raised again for our
[50:35] justification amen Heavenly Father Lord
[50:38] we come today just asking you Lord to
[50:41] take charge
[50:42] Lord take our thoughts and disfocus them
[50:45] Lord in the fashion you would desire
[50:48] open your word and make it living to us
[50:50] today Lord that we could leave the house
[50:52] of God today saying it truly was good to
[50:56] be in the house of God not not just a
[50:58] nice day but our hearts and our souls
[51:01] being able to just reach out and and
[51:03] take a halt of you father the word and
[51:06] and rejoice in your presence we ask you
[51:09] father for every need every prayer
[51:11] request spoken or unspoken for every
[51:14] situation of every family for every
[51:16] co-worker every friend Father whatever
[51:19] it might be we would ask you to come on
[51:22] the scene father for this is the hour
[51:24] that you said your word would come to
[51:26] life and be manifested before the world
[51:28] Lord as a blessing to the bride of
[51:31] Christ and as a judgment to the
[51:33] unbeliever now Lord we come to worship
[51:36] you today we come to hear your word and
[51:38] to say Amen father not to the preacher
[51:41] but to your word we thank you for that
[51:44] and ask your blessings now in the name
[51:46] of Jesus Christ amen amen you may be
[51:50] seated
[52:03] for something to last
[52:06] it needs a good foundation
[52:09] I don't want to deviate into this but
[52:11] we'll see sometimes that we we can't
[52:14] understand why people will
[52:16] be in the house of God for a season
[52:19] and then they'll wander or drift away
[52:21] and and we oftentimes say well maybe
[52:24] maybe they're an unbeliever
[52:28] but my brother and sister sometimes it
[52:30] was just simply the lack of good
[52:33] foundational teaching
[52:35] laying the foundation that they could
[52:39] build on now my brother and sister just
[52:41] a quick reference of scripture as we'll
[52:44] look
[52:45] anywhere you go in the world today you
[52:48] can find foundations that have been
[52:50] built on sand
[52:53] a type of the unbeliever he believed
[52:57] enough to build but not enough to last
[52:59] and you'll find that we have out our
[53:02] Direction a man wanted to build a house
[53:05] in a certain neighborhood and uh you
[53:08] know we knew what the land was like
[53:10] there and um uh you know he he bought
[53:14] the the piece of property spent a
[53:16] considerable sum of money uh and uh his
[53:20] plans were for a house with a full
[53:22] basement
[53:23] I think he's about a hundred and fifty
[53:25] thousand dollars pounding that hole in
[53:28] the Rock and he still does not have a
[53:31] basement but my brother and sister one
[53:33] thing the man does know his house is not
[53:36] going anywhere amen but it cost a great
[53:39] price and so we'll see that it is there
[53:42] that sometimes we have to pay a price to
[53:44] make sure the house is secure and it is
[53:47] exactly what it is that we desired to
[53:49] have built and Paul was anointed to lay
[53:52] this Foundation which to us is a solid
[53:55] rock of the word can we say amen and so
[53:58] it's there that as he was called to lay
[54:01] this Foundation Paul paid a price for
[54:04] that my brother and sister you read
[54:05] through the word Paul was pardon me
[54:08] putting it this way Paul was not a
[54:09] crybaby but yet you can see in the word
[54:13] you can catch the fact that there was a
[54:15] great price that Paul paid to lay this
[54:18] Foundation but God knew that Paul had in
[54:22] him the ability to not pay the price
[54:25] because Christ paid the price but to let
[54:28] the price flow through him amen so God
[54:32] does not bypass us and say I'm going to
[54:34] take care of this this is why our lord
[54:37] Jesus died on Calvary died as a blam
[54:40] before the foundation of the world but
[54:42] yet my brother and sister we come today
[54:44] and we are still sacrificing we are
[54:48] still laying our lives on the altar
[54:51] because as they say in the world you
[54:53] need a piece of Flesh in the game amen
[54:56] and God chose our flesh in this game and
[54:59] he made us able to pay the price that we
[55:03] must pay to achieve what he has already
[55:06] paid for us does that make sense amen so
[55:09] Paul was anointed to delay the
[55:11] foundation and when I say that I want
[55:14] you to catch this my brother and sister
[55:16] we are called and anointed to believe it
[55:20] and pay the price for our time for our
[55:23] day amen and does it cost us come on
[55:26] let's be honest it costs us it is not a
[55:30] cakewalk it costs us we make sacrifices
[55:33] and we fight battles and we struggle you
[55:36] know as much as the fellowship was
[55:37] beautiful last night I woke up about 4
[55:40] 15 4 20 this morning never went back to
[55:43] sleep so my brother and sister if I just
[55:46] stop for a little bit just don't worry
[55:48] I'm only taking a quick cat nap just to
[55:50] get enough energy to continue but I'm
[55:53] telling you my brother and sister when
[55:55] God wants to deal with you you will
[55:58] volunteer to pay the price we're not
[56:01] going to complain to God Lord you're
[56:02] charging too much you're asking too much
[56:05] but what we need to do is say Lord give
[56:08] me the ability to just stand up step
[56:11] forward pay the price without a doubt
[56:14] without a hesitation and this is what
[56:17] God has called and anointed us today is
[56:20] to be Believers now you know that term
[56:23] Believers has become so convoluted and
[56:27] watered down we have people of all
[56:29] shades and all flavors and all whatever
[56:31] different ideas and they say we're
[56:33] Believers my brother and sister I don't
[56:36] mean to sound derogatory but don't let
[56:39] that be how you judge it the prophet of
[56:42] God showed us quite clearly our life is
[56:45] our billboard amen not our words
[56:48] amen so let our life be the billboard of
[56:52] Jesus Christ amen and when we come and
[56:56] we stand upon this and recognize this is
[56:59] what God called me to be I don't need
[57:01] some kind of easy Bed of Roses what I
[57:04] need as to press forward and say Lord
[57:07] help me amen you called me Lord you've
[57:10] made the way for me I can do it amen
[57:13] it's a very very tricky fine line uh
[57:16] that you can come my brother and sister
[57:18] we were actually talking about this last
[57:20] night we've made it kind of a difficult
[57:23] thing for our young people we either
[57:25] browbeat them into the altar feeling
[57:28] guilty or we just throw it out and say
[57:31] well the God's in control just whatever
[57:33] will happen God help us to strike the
[57:35] balance amen of the fact that God called
[57:38] us to a life he didn't call us to quit
[57:41] on us and he didn't call us to quit on
[57:43] him but he said I am able to perform
[57:46] this work I have began in you amen this
[57:51] is what we need to instill in our young
[57:52] people is not that life gets tough you
[57:55] run but when life gets tough you go to
[57:59] the Lord and say Lord I cannot go any
[58:02] further and he is already on the scene
[58:06] amen he's not I'll be there in 30 days
[58:08] I'll be there 90 days but yet we get the
[58:11] idea when we don't see results for a
[58:14] period of time that God was not there no
[58:16] my brother and sister he's right on the
[58:18] scene and he is working on our behalf
[58:21] Can someone say amen for that and so as
[58:24] we take this we realize what God is
[58:27] asking us to do now this is out of order
[58:29] out of time I'm sorry so I'll probably
[58:31] repeat it but my brother and sister the
[58:33] prophet of God come and over and over
[58:35] again spoke to you and I and said only
[58:38] believe he made the song only believe a
[58:42] very Foundation of what we as Believers
[58:46] of the message would stand on he drove
[58:48] that home he planted that seed he
[58:52] watered that seed he weeded everything
[58:54] from around it and said what you've got
[58:56] to do is believe you don't need to be a
[58:59] scholar to teach it you don't need to
[59:01] have this and have that you just need to
[59:03] stand I don't need my name in lights I
[59:06] need to have faith enough to believe the
[59:08] word but it's not just having word to
[59:10] believe you have to act on it to make it
[59:13] come to pass
[59:15] you can Harbor in your heart
[59:18] reminds me of a Little Love Story Once
[59:22] this couple ended up getting married in
[59:24] their 50s
[59:26] this boy loved this girl so much but he
[59:28] never told herself
[59:30] and she loved him so much she said to
[59:33] the Lord if he doesn't ask me to marry
[59:36] him I will never get married because I
[59:38] cannot take the love I have and just go
[59:41] give it to another
[59:43] and about 50 years old they meet again
[59:46] and they're talking and they're
[59:48] remembering Good Times
[59:51] oh remember when we were young we were
[59:53] here remember when this happened
[59:55] remember our friends remember this and
[59:58] it just comes around it comes out of the
[1:00:00] man's mouth subconsciously he doesn't
[1:00:02] think about this and he said you know
[1:00:04] from those days I've always loved you
[1:00:09] and she looked at him and said then why
[1:00:10] didn't you tell me
[1:00:14] he said I didn't have the courage
[1:00:18] 30 Wasted Years
[1:00:22] 30 Wasted Years
[1:00:26] because someone didn't have courage
[1:00:28] enough
[1:00:29] to lift up hands and say I love you
[1:00:33] I love you Lord
[1:00:35] can't live without you
[1:00:37] I've got to have you amen
[1:00:40] we shouldn't be
[1:00:42] in the forcing business
[1:00:45] amen we should be in the manifesting
[1:00:47] business
[1:00:49] we should be showing that our Lord Jesus
[1:00:51] Christ is worthy of our love
[1:00:53] we should be showing that we can't live
[1:00:55] without him that we need him not laws
[1:00:58] and do's and don'ts my brother and
[1:01:00] sister that will never do it amen look I
[1:01:03] grew up in that era those of the church
[1:01:05] here you know I grew up in that era when
[1:01:07] it was a do and don't thing and it
[1:01:09] didn't work my brother and sister it did
[1:01:11] not work at all but by God's grace you
[1:01:15] can come back and realize that by God's
[1:01:17] grace if we can instill a foundation
[1:01:21] under the church it will weather the
[1:01:24] storm the church Falling In Love With
[1:01:26] Jesus amen maybe we'll sing that song at
[1:01:28] the end of this service amen it's the
[1:01:30] greatest thing we've ever done was fall
[1:01:32] in love with Jesus
[1:01:34] amen see we're just called We're
[1:01:37] anointed to believe
[1:01:38] Amen to declare this amen and when you
[1:01:42] take this in accordance to the scripture
[1:01:44] here
[1:01:45] it is counted to you
[1:01:48] as righteousness
[1:01:51] this elect lady
[1:01:53] now I almost included the quote but I
[1:01:55] read it a couple Services ago and I'm
[1:01:57] sure every one of you can just draw that
[1:01:59] right up
[1:02:00] but the prophet of God says we're not
[1:02:02] here to manufacture this
[1:02:07] we can't manufacture this because we
[1:02:11] can't help but put a human ingredient
[1:02:13] into it when we start to manufacture is
[1:02:16] we've got to just let God do it amen and
[1:02:19] when he comes on the scene and he starts
[1:02:21] to work amen you'll get to see as we
[1:02:24] were visiting you get to see sons and
[1:02:26] daughters that are away from God and it
[1:02:29] doesn't look good my brother and sister
[1:02:30] but when God comes on the scene amen he
[1:02:34] will change the picture amen we don't
[1:02:37] have to try to coerce or force or bribe
[1:02:41] or do whatever don't intimidate don't
[1:02:44] make them feel like oh you're going to
[1:02:45] go to hell if you don't line up right
[1:02:47] now why don't we get into a place that
[1:02:50] we can say Lord I'm on your side and you
[1:02:53] claim them I claim them the word claims
[1:02:56] them and it's going to happen I believe
[1:02:59] it Lord and God is imputing that as
[1:03:02] righteousness to the elect lady because
[1:03:05] she's standing there saying your word is
[1:03:07] true your word is true your word is true
[1:03:10] that's the truth that's the truth that's
[1:03:13] the truth and God says that's my elect
[1:03:16] lady that's my bride she knows that I'm
[1:03:19] here for her
[1:03:21] amen I'll tell you there's nothing like
[1:03:23] make a man work his fingers to the Bone
[1:03:25] than to have a wife and family that is
[1:03:28] there saying thank you thank you for
[1:03:31] what you're doing thank you for your
[1:03:33] labors thank you for your love but
[1:03:35] there's something will make a man turn
[1:03:37] and go away and become an idol uh a
[1:03:40] worthless man and that is when
[1:03:42] everything is a criticism everything is
[1:03:45] undermining everything is a deal and it
[1:03:47] will be now my brother and sister you'll
[1:03:50] take a relationship now excuse me I had
[1:03:52] this and notes I took it out of notes it
[1:03:53] just somehow just appeared again amen
[1:03:55] you know what the difference was between
[1:03:57] vashti and Esther
[1:04:00] there's there's a whole list we can make
[1:04:02] a whole list but we could make it real
[1:04:03] simple amen they were both women
[1:04:07] amen they were both wives
[1:04:09] they were both Queens
[1:04:11] but I want to cut this short here
[1:04:13] because I've gotten like a whole whole
[1:04:15] anyway
[1:04:17] what it was the real difference
[1:04:20] they occupied these same positions
[1:04:24] but vashti came into identity of her own
[1:04:31] and when she was no longer identified in
[1:04:34] her husband in the king of kings
[1:04:37] amen and she took on an identity of her
[1:04:40] own she took on a rebellious spirit and
[1:04:44] in her identity she thought that she was
[1:04:48] co-equal with the King
[1:04:51] and yet we see when Esther come that day
[1:04:55] and the scepter is held forth he give
[1:04:58] even to the half of my kingdom
[1:05:01] but let's understand to have half of the
[1:05:03] Kingdom doesn't mean that we step out of
[1:05:06] our position and our identity doesn't
[1:05:09] become our own identity because half of
[1:05:11] this place is mine our identity is still
[1:05:14] in our husband our identity is still in
[1:05:19] the king amen and when we stay in our
[1:05:22] right place look at the authority amen
[1:05:25] wives look at the authority as a wife
[1:05:28] not a doormat not a dish rag but a wife
[1:05:31] in subjection look at the authority the
[1:05:34] word gives you you have authority to the
[1:05:36] half of your family's Kingdom amen and
[1:05:40] you have great authority to exercise
[1:05:43] that and we as the bride of Christ
[1:05:45] staying subject to our King to our
[1:05:48] husband come and we've been given power
[1:05:51] over demons we've been given power over
[1:05:53] spirits of the age and the circumstance
[1:05:56] we've been given the authority to claim
[1:05:58] children to claim husbands claim one
[1:06:01] lives and step right into that position
[1:06:03] I don't want an identity of my own I
[1:06:07] want to be identified in Jesus Christ
[1:06:10] amen and God does not turn you and I
[1:06:13] into dish rags
[1:06:15] amen he actually is exalting us can
[1:06:19] someone say Amen our God is exalting the
[1:06:23] bride the elect Lady of this age he's
[1:06:25] lifting her up there's never been a wife
[1:06:28] like my wife there's not one so
[1:06:31] beautiful and so powerful as my wife and
[1:06:35] he's not putting her in an awkward
[1:06:37] position because she knows that when she
[1:06:40] speaks and she speaks correctly motive
[1:06:43] and objective that God will honor that
[1:06:46] I know these are silly but when we're in
[1:06:49] South Africa we were we were out in
[1:06:51] Kruger they took us for a lovely time
[1:06:53] out there and we had already seen the
[1:06:56] big five and you know there's people
[1:06:58] that go there we talked to a lady she
[1:07:00] said I've been coming here I don't
[1:07:01] remember the years now 15 years she'd
[1:07:04] never seen a a leopard she'd never seen
[1:07:07] the big five I think she said the most
[1:07:09] she'd seen was three in a trip not even
[1:07:11] the same day in a trip and we're there
[1:07:14] and and brother Gideon's taking us and
[1:07:17] and we see the big five and and we're
[1:07:19] thrilled but as we're driving along I
[1:07:22] don't want to sound ungrateful but I
[1:07:24] just want to tell you this is how
[1:07:25] mindful our God is of us we're driving
[1:07:28] along and in my thoughts I don't even
[1:07:30] say it out loud Lord you know I've
[1:07:33] always saw in all these uh National
[1:07:35] Geographic or whatever kind of things
[1:07:37] the leopard that's draped over the tree
[1:07:40] limb 20 feet off he's so relaxed you
[1:07:43] know his Tails hanging down all four
[1:07:45] feets hanging down his tongues hanging
[1:07:47] out the side of his mouth he's just ah
[1:07:50] and I was thinking Lord that is some of
[1:07:52] the coolest pictures I've ever seen I
[1:07:54] would love to see a leopard in a tree
[1:07:57] within 30 minutes we are looking at a
[1:08:00] leopard in a tree even to the point his
[1:08:03] tongue is hanging out of his mouth
[1:08:06] no no no that just sounds like that's
[1:08:09] that's nothing no I believe my brother
[1:08:11] and sister I believe that's a God who is
[1:08:13] mindful of our needs and we just need to
[1:08:15] have the expectation but if you have no
[1:08:18] expectation of God my brother and sister
[1:08:21] what are you waiting for him to do he's
[1:08:23] already satisfied you amen that was a
[1:08:26] good point I took home last night
[1:08:28] brother amen it's there our brother I'll
[1:08:30] give you a little Clarity our brother's
[1:08:32] talking about how when there's just one
[1:08:33] in this assembly and it could be this
[1:08:35] morning when there's just one that needs
[1:08:38] something more from the Lord he will not
[1:08:41] leave he's here saying is there
[1:08:43] something I can do for you is there
[1:08:46] something you need what is it you need
[1:08:48] and if there is just one he will not
[1:08:51] leave the building
[1:08:53] because he cares about the needs of our
[1:08:56] life to the smallest degree amen and
[1:09:00] when it becomes that real to us my
[1:09:02] brother and sister we're not going to
[1:09:04] flaunt it we're the life of the king we
[1:09:08] don't need to flaunt it we have already
[1:09:10] been called into a high order into a hot
[1:09:14] position
[1:09:16] oh Hallelujah
[1:09:18] now I just want to touch on this you
[1:09:20] know the scripture said they're fully
[1:09:22] persuaded amen now persuade is to call
[1:09:25] someone to do something by asking
[1:09:27] arguing or giving reason to call someone
[1:09:30] to believe something it can be used as a
[1:09:33] transitive verb Amen to move by an
[1:09:36] argument now that's no way to spread the
[1:09:39] gospel move it by an argument
[1:09:41] amen
[1:09:43] we can move it by entreaty
[1:09:45] but you see a minister
[1:09:48] can beg you
[1:09:50] service after service
[1:09:53] it won't change you
[1:09:56] get down with tears
[1:09:59] on our knees and beg you
[1:10:02] but it won't change
[1:10:06] but there is a persuasion
[1:10:09] that comes that God uses and
[1:10:12] I love this you know sometimes we have
[1:10:15] we have little stories in the message
[1:10:17] and if we're not careful they're just
[1:10:18] little stories in the message
[1:10:22] but you know the power of persuasion the
[1:10:24] world believes
[1:10:25] I'm interested
[1:10:27] I I like to sometimes sitting in the
[1:10:29] tractor I listen to these things you
[1:10:31] know and they have the Sandler Sales
[1:10:34] Training and they have different
[1:10:35] companies you know that are teaching
[1:10:37] salesmen and you'll have this and every
[1:10:39] once in a while it'll come real close to
[1:10:41] home amen there was a man that I grew up
[1:10:43] with amen and uh he used to make
[1:10:46] declarations he had quite a following
[1:10:48] and people would pay money to come to
[1:10:50] his seminars and um he would make the
[1:10:53] boast that I can sell anybody anything
[1:10:57] and I always thought that was very
[1:10:58] interesting in that boast but you see
[1:11:01] for him to sell
[1:11:03] anything to anybody they had to actually
[1:11:06] not believe in what he was selling
[1:11:07] because he's admitting he can just pick
[1:11:08] anything and sell it to you they had to
[1:11:10] believe in the man
[1:11:12] and so when they believed that the man
[1:11:14] was telling him you cannot live without
[1:11:17] this
[1:11:18] people would pay hundreds of dollars to
[1:11:21] sit there and then they would pay
[1:11:22] thousands of dollars to have his books
[1:11:24] and you know it was there with the idea
[1:11:27] of teaching these sales class classes
[1:11:29] that that uh you know it would be I'm
[1:11:32] gonna make you a super salesman but what
[1:11:35] they didn't realize is there is a
[1:11:39] sincerity meter that God built into
[1:11:41] humanity and in that sincerity meter you
[1:11:44] not are only buying into the product but
[1:11:47] you're buying into the individual and my
[1:11:50] brother and sister would sound like
[1:11:51] you're I'm talking about the preacher
[1:11:53] I'm not you have to to receive the
[1:11:57] benefit of eternal life you have to
[1:12:00] believe in Jesus Christ it's not just
[1:12:04] believing in Salvation it's not just
[1:12:06] believing in forgiveness of sin you'd
[1:12:09] say but that's what it is no my brother
[1:12:11] and sister you have to believe in Jesus
[1:12:14] Christ because he is so much more than
[1:12:17] salvation he is so much more than
[1:12:20] healing he is so much more than any one
[1:12:23] of these all put together it is the word
[1:12:25] but we have to believe in him and in
[1:12:29] that when you come to the place that you
[1:12:31] have belief in a person as a Salesman he
[1:12:34] would tell you honestly this is the best
[1:12:37] product
[1:12:38] than I've ever sold
[1:12:41] and I'm sorry I've been around the block
[1:12:43] a couple times
[1:12:47] not that long ago had a man I've known
[1:12:50] forever salesman changed jobs now he's
[1:12:52] working for this company and he come by
[1:12:55] the shop and he says Paul this is the
[1:12:56] best penetrating oil ever
[1:13:00] I said how far are you going to stand
[1:13:01] behind it we will stand behind it if
[1:13:04] it's no good
[1:13:06] what you're going to give me
[1:13:07] if it's no good
[1:13:11] well I don't want to give you anything
[1:13:14] then why should I try it
[1:13:16] well I'll replace the money
[1:13:18] no you're just wasting my time
[1:13:22] um you use this other product I'll give
[1:13:24] you some of that that you know works if
[1:13:26] this doesn't work
[1:13:27] well I played a little hard ball with
[1:13:29] him and he comes along and poor old
[1:13:31] feels like no you need to try this and I
[1:13:33] said if you believe in it that much then
[1:13:35] give it to me
[1:13:39] well the company don't like it doing it
[1:13:42] then Phil you buy it and give it to me
[1:13:46] and if it works I'll buy from you
[1:13:49] and in the end you'll make more
[1:13:52] than what the can of
[1:13:54] that's the best stuff you've ever seen
[1:13:57] you spray it on a rusty bolt and you can
[1:13:59] watch the rust melt and just drip off of
[1:14:01] there and you can just turn that nut or
[1:14:03] unthread that thing it's the most
[1:14:05] awesome stuff but you know he was so
[1:14:07] elated that I was interested in his
[1:14:09] product he totally forgot that I said
[1:14:11] I'd buy that Cannon so I got a free can
[1:14:15] but my brother and sister when we come
[1:14:17] down to it we have to come to the place
[1:14:20] if God says we believe it foreign
[1:14:24] we can't come and say what are you going
[1:14:25] to give me what are you going to make up
[1:14:27] for if this doesn't work if I go to
[1:14:30] church and church doesn't work for me
[1:14:31] what are you going to do for me no my
[1:14:33] brother and sister we have to come to
[1:14:34] the place that we believe him just as
[1:14:38] the young woman amen would come and a
[1:14:40] young man says I want to marry you I
[1:14:43] want to you to be my love my wife for
[1:14:46] the rest of my life my brother and
[1:14:48] sister she doesn't come along if she's
[1:14:50] really in love and she knows he's in
[1:14:52] love with her she doesn't say okay if
[1:14:54] this ends at five years what do you give
[1:14:56] me if it ends at 10 what do you do for
[1:14:58] me if it ends at 15 what's the deal if
[1:15:01] it ends here my brother and sister we
[1:15:03] don't come to God on conditions we come
[1:15:06] to God unconditional amen we come as
[1:15:10] Believers and we say Lord you said it I
[1:15:14] believe you Lord and He imputes
[1:15:18] righteousness to you my brother and
[1:15:20] sister because you believed him
[1:15:23] oh Hallelujah see this is much more than
[1:15:27] just all we're gonna try my brother and
[1:15:29] sister when you believe you do amen you
[1:15:33] don't try you do
[1:15:35] oh forgive me for being excited
[1:15:37] Hallelujah but you see the world wants
[1:15:40] to convince you of your need but God
[1:15:42] works in another fashion you can say
[1:15:44] well I preached such a strong sermon and
[1:15:47] that it really struck this and they
[1:15:48] realized they needed the Lord my brother
[1:15:50] my sister God's been dealing with him
[1:15:52] for so long you maybe house a catalyst
[1:15:56] to change that but you didn't put the
[1:15:59] need in them amen I'm telling you when
[1:16:02] you come and you're sitting here today
[1:16:04] and maybe you would say you know what
[1:16:07] um I I I I if you can talk me into this
[1:16:10] you know I'll serve God I'll do this but
[1:16:13] if I can talk you into it maybe tomorrow
[1:16:15] the next day somebody can talk you out
[1:16:18] of it amen but I'll tell you what we
[1:16:21] don't have to do if you're sitting here
[1:16:23] this morning and you're hungry I don't
[1:16:26] have to convince you you're hungry I
[1:16:29] don't have to come and say oh surely
[1:16:31] you're hungry you guys should be hungry
[1:16:34] the prophet said come to church hungry
[1:16:37] so surely because you believe the
[1:16:39] message you would be hungry if you are
[1:16:41] hungry you know you're hungry you don't
[1:16:46] need someone to convince you you're
[1:16:48] hungry
[1:16:50] what we do sometimes need is to be
[1:16:52] convinced that what we're eating is not
[1:16:55] the answer
[1:16:56] amen
[1:16:57] because I can't tell you how much I love
[1:16:59] Oreos
[1:17:02] amen
[1:17:04] Oreos are
[1:17:06] the best tasting chemicals you've ever
[1:17:08] touched in your life
[1:17:13] and I get near an Oreo we're walking
[1:17:15] through the store the other day and that
[1:17:16] was a deal you know the devil knows how
[1:17:18] to position it they never put the Oreos
[1:17:22] on sale beside the broccoli in the back
[1:17:26] corner of the store
[1:17:28] no sir the Oreo deal is right here with
[1:17:32] a cash register right there so that you
[1:17:35] get right there and you're like I love
[1:17:37] you Oreos
[1:17:38] Oreos I don't think I can live without
[1:17:41] you
[1:17:42] and I only have to walk five steps and
[1:17:44] whip a credit card out in your mind
[1:17:46] I don't even have time to think about it
[1:17:49] I don't have time to repent from it
[1:17:52] and the devil he likes to just put these
[1:17:55] things right there
[1:17:56] and convince you how much you need
[1:17:59] his chemical
[1:18:03] oh
[1:18:07] double stuff
[1:18:12] praise the Lord anybody want to come to
[1:18:14] our house tonight for a Oreo feast
[1:18:19] but when there's a deep calling
[1:18:23] God doesn't have to put everything in
[1:18:26] front of you that you stumble every day
[1:18:28] of your life stumble doesn't have to
[1:18:30] have you on the place and this this
[1:18:32] happens God knows how to do this there's
[1:18:34] a brother back East he works in a siding
[1:18:36] Factory and
[1:18:38] um you know he was a pretty rough
[1:18:40] character and he's working in this
[1:18:42] siding Factory and it turns out that
[1:18:44] there's a pastor of a small Message
[1:18:46] Church there that the church wasn't big
[1:18:48] enough to support him and the brother
[1:18:49] wanted his days to be able to be a
[1:18:51] pastor so he worked night shift in a
[1:18:54] siding Factory and so lo and behold this
[1:18:57] man Carlos Brother Carlos is here
[1:19:00] working and now Brother Carlos is this
[1:19:02] giant enormous man and he's working in
[1:19:06] this uh siding Factory and here is this
[1:19:09] like five foot five skinny as a rail

[1:19:15] bit you know that kind of a guy oh did I
[1:19:17] say that
[1:19:18] um anyway uh
[1:19:21] and and he this Brother Carlos would
[1:19:23] look down on him and he would think
[1:19:26] thoughts like I could break him like a
[1:19:28] twig
[1:19:30] and this pastor Fearless they'd be
[1:19:33] working there
[1:19:34] Carlos
[1:19:35] yeah
[1:19:37] what you gonna do when you die
[1:19:40] they're going to bury me it's what
[1:19:42] they're going to do
[1:19:43] yeah but what happens after that I ain't
[1:19:45] thinking of it
[1:19:46] and he's working
[1:19:48] Carlos what

[1:19:54] the chef Foreman comes over are you guys
[1:19:56] in an argument no sir
[1:19:59] Carlos is like leave me alone
[1:20:03] I will once you repent
[1:20:08] that'll work for everybody it worked on
[1:20:11] Carlos
[1:20:12] one day Carlos is like okay if you're so
[1:20:14] convinced this God's real I have
[1:20:16] something I'm thinking about and the
[1:20:18] brother says you can't just think about
[1:20:20] it you need to open your mouth
[1:20:23] not in public you need to open your
[1:20:25] mouth and say Lord if you're real
[1:20:27] Brother Carlos will tell you you've got
[1:20:29] to be careful the challenge you put to
[1:20:31] God when you say God if you are real
[1:20:34] because our God is real

[1:21:10] Carlos's last name but if you guys have
[1:21:12] ever met Brother Carlos he's got risks
[1:21:14] bigger than my arms
[1:21:16] he says just giant of a man and this
[1:21:18] brother looked at him and says Carlos
[1:21:21] just tell me the truth
[1:21:23] wasn't there something inside of you
[1:21:27] that's been crying out for years
[1:21:36] you can't make someone hungry
[1:21:40] but when the hunger is there
[1:21:44] the word says call on my name
[1:21:46] and I'll come I'll satisfy that hunger
[1:21:50] so you look at this my brother and
[1:21:51] sister now the prophet of God says I
[1:21:53] didn't bring the quote but brother Brown
[1:21:56] says that you know even from a child
[1:21:58] you've known that you were different
[1:22:00] can anyone say Amen to that
[1:22:03] we're just different now the world would
[1:22:05] like you to believe that you're the odd
[1:22:08] duck amen but my brother and sister the
[1:22:10] truth of it is it's that seed Gene of
[1:22:13] God that made you different and the
[1:22:16] world wants you to make them like that
[1:22:19] now you talk about the power of
[1:22:21] persuasion that the devil oh it's not
[1:22:23] the devil it's my best friend wants me
[1:22:24] to go have fun no I'm telling you it's
[1:22:27] the devil trying to get you to defile
[1:22:30] your body a temple of the Holy Ghost
[1:22:33] because there's not a temple on every
[1:22:35] corner my brother and sister you go to
[1:22:37] Israel you tour the country north and
[1:22:40] south and east and west there as much as
[1:22:42] that is considered a religious country
[1:22:44] there's not a temple on every corner
[1:22:46] amen and there's not a temple on every
[1:22:49] corner here in the earth now the city of
[1:22:51] Nampa has a church on almost every
[1:22:52] corner but my brother and sister those
[1:22:54] churches are not temples
[1:22:56] amen if Jesus was here today he would be
[1:22:59] sitting outside there plaiting the cords
[1:23:02] and he'd be getting ready to chase them
[1:23:04] out because they're claiming it's a
[1:23:06] house of God while he says they're den
[1:23:08] of Thieves
[1:23:11] I'm not preaching too stiff am I
[1:23:14] you see my brother and sister
[1:23:17] it comes to a place that we
[1:23:20] don't need to convince you you're hungry
[1:23:22] and that's how God works now let's go
[1:23:25] back to Romans 4 verse 18 who against
[1:23:28] hope believed in hope that he might
[1:23:30] become the father of many nations
[1:23:32] according to that which was spoken and
[1:23:34] so shall thy seed be so this word right
[1:23:37] here is declaring my brother and sister
[1:23:39] that you are going to believe in hope
[1:23:42] against all things it won't be anything
[1:23:45] Satan can put in front of you that will
[1:23:48] keep you from believing amen from having
[1:23:51] hope in the word of God now you can get
[1:23:54] real Technical and hope is not faith
[1:23:58] but hope
[1:24:00] is the flower bed that Faith grows from
[1:24:04] because if you have no hope you don't
[1:24:06] plant
[1:24:08] I'm a farmer
[1:24:10] I can tell you if you have no hope
[1:24:13] you don't plant
[1:24:15] amen you would just sit on your chair I
[1:24:17] remember years ago just throw this in
[1:24:19] real quick commodity prices were such
[1:24:21] there wasn't a crop that we had
[1:24:23] available to us that had any profit
[1:24:25] built in it and one of our neighbors he
[1:24:27] just went out there and a couple times
[1:24:29] during the summer almost the entirety of
[1:24:31] his farm he just dissed the weeds down
[1:24:33] and we're like what are you doing and he
[1:24:35] says well if I'm going to lose money I'm
[1:24:37] going to lose the least that I can amen
[1:24:40] and so we all planted crops and and in
[1:24:43] the end of the year is it's winding down
[1:24:45] uh fertilizer prices fuel prices
[1:24:48] everything had been just extremely high
[1:24:51] and we're winding down to the end of the
[1:24:54] year now this man is secure because he
[1:24:57] feels like because I did little I'll
[1:24:59] lose little but my brother and sister it
[1:25:01] got to be about October of that year and
[1:25:04] I literally had stacks of hay all over
[1:25:06] the place because I just kept saying I
[1:25:07] can't sell it that cheap I can't give
[1:25:09] this to someone and that's what it would
[1:25:11] come down to and at the end of the year
[1:25:13] got to be about October going into
[1:25:15] November woke up one day and corn
[1:25:17] Futures had tripled amen and corn
[1:25:20] suddenly was up here where it was
[1:25:22] extremely profitable and beans just went
[1:25:24] through the roof and Alfalfa Haye just
[1:25:26] went through the roof because places
[1:25:28] like Nevada and wherever had just dried
[1:25:30] up and it wasn't there and this man is
[1:25:33] there going oh if I had only oh if I had
[1:25:36] only my brother and sister if we had
[1:25:39] only but I'm not here to pursue or to
[1:25:42] try and persuade you if you had only I
[1:25:45] want you to just follow the hunger God
[1:25:48] has placed in your heart amen he didn't
[1:25:51] call the believer the elect lady to sit
[1:25:54] idle in laodicea he didn't call for us
[1:25:58] to find a safe place where we invest
[1:26:00] little and expect a little or none in
[1:26:03] return but he said I want you to go and
[1:26:06] the prophet put it in these beautiful
[1:26:07] words of this day keep planting your
[1:26:10] potatoes get out of bed in the morning
[1:26:12] read your Bible pray and go to work
[1:26:16] believing God is with you amen and when
[1:26:20] the circumstance changes and you have
[1:26:23] got up maybe in a moment you don't feel
[1:26:25] strong but your prayer oh can you catch
[1:26:28] this your prayer whether you pray it oh
[1:26:31] Lord or you pray it
[1:26:35] it has the same exact impact when it
[1:26:39] hits the Throne of God we don't have to
[1:26:42] scream it amen that's why you see many
[1:26:44] of these Pentecostal preachers I
[1:26:46] wouldn't want to went through the prayer
[1:26:47] line they might have healed my headache
[1:26:49] but I had to go see the chiropractor
[1:26:51] when they got done with me oh death Hall
[1:26:54] and they just shake them oh my brother
[1:26:56] and sister T.L Osborne go listen to it
[1:26:59] he's talking about that he said Satan
[1:27:03] I adore you
[1:27:06] didn't scream didn't jump didn't haul
[1:27:08] her didn't beat on them why because our
[1:27:12] Authority as the elect lady is not how
[1:27:15] loud our voice is
[1:27:17] amen it's our relationship with the King
[1:27:21] and look at Esther Esther comes they say
[1:27:24] Esther you do that they'll banish you
[1:27:26] you'll never see the King again my
[1:27:28] brother and sister you know this one my
[1:27:30] favorite little subject but it's there
[1:27:31] Esther coming to the Courtyard or the
[1:27:34] Fourier she didn't stop and say oh my I
[1:27:36] hope I live through this my brother and
[1:27:38] sister she said that's not a king that's
[1:27:41] my husband I'm not just a queen I'm his
[1:27:45] wife
[1:27:46] and there's our relationship is built
[1:27:50] not in just a title I'm a Christian I'm
[1:27:53] a Believer but it's built in this
[1:27:55] relationship we have as the elect Lady
[1:27:58] of Jesus Christ Can someone say Amen to
[1:28:01] that thank you Lord of the relationship
[1:28:05] amen and he says that's what your seed
[1:28:09] will be in verse 19 and being not weak
[1:28:12] in faith
[1:28:15] I'm going to hurry right along here
[1:28:16] because I want to finish this
[1:28:18] amen
[1:28:22] what was the original seed that was
[1:28:23] passed down
[1:28:26] spoken word
[1:28:30] God put it in a box and gave it to
[1:28:32] Abraham right
[1:28:35] no he didn't did he
[1:28:38] remember what the prophet of God talked
[1:28:39] about radio waves and all of that
[1:28:42] those voices the voice of George
[1:28:44] Washington whatever is still
[1:28:46] echoing through the heavens
[1:28:49] and if we had the ability we'd hear
[1:28:51] conversation that was spoken 200 years
[1:28:54] ago
[1:28:56] and God spoke those words to Abraham
[1:29:00] they didn't stop
[1:29:02] at Abraham
[1:29:05] and you're sitting here today hearing
[1:29:07] that's it those words
[1:29:10] you're hearing the very nature of
[1:29:13] Christ's coming being communicated out
[1:29:16] and something we don't even the antenna
[1:29:19] that we don't even see amen but is in US
[1:29:23] is catching the message of God from the
[1:29:26] Throne of God Amen we don't need to have
[1:29:29] some big stack of books and have all of
[1:29:31] these things my brother and sister God
[1:29:33] built an antenna into the elect lady
[1:29:35] where she is hearing the word of God not
[1:29:39] only the word of God but she is catching
[1:29:41] the mind of Christ
[1:29:44] amen it's not that you have to have
[1:29:46] everything spoken to you I I don't
[1:29:48] expect you to speak out or we won't
[1:29:50] interact too long on this but tell me
[1:29:52] have you not in your life had God speak
[1:29:54] to you and it come to pass in just a
[1:29:58] little while amen something the Lord
[1:30:00] said don't go there or don't be involved
[1:30:03] or listen or or they'll be they're
[1:30:05] trying to trick you or some kind of
[1:30:07] thing and it comes to pass what is that
[1:30:09] psychology no that is the mind of Christ
[1:30:13] the antenna that God put into the elect
[1:30:16] lady to catch the word of God that came
[1:30:19] from the Throne of God in the very
[1:30:21] beginning oh my goodness that's why we
[1:30:24] can sit right here today and we can be
[1:30:26] here and we can realize amen my flesh is
[1:30:30] telling me I'm weak the devil's telling
[1:30:32] me I'm weak but the word says my God
[1:30:35] says my king says my husband says I'm
[1:30:39] not weak in faith I'm not weak in faith
[1:30:43] how Hallelujah see this is not just a
[1:30:46] possibility this is a house man it's
[1:30:48] done now let's look for a moment are we
[1:30:51] doing okay amen let's look for a moment
[1:30:53] into a spiritual seed Gene only we're
[1:30:55] going to touch the the natural side
[1:30:57] first amen now we know what the prophet
[1:31:00] of God has said about hybrid
[1:31:02] and look at this my brother and sister I
[1:31:04] want to take this point and drive it
[1:31:05] home to you do you realize that all
[1:31:07] hybrids have what you call a regressive
[1:31:10] trait
[1:31:11] any of you biologists in here
[1:31:15] they have a regressive trait
[1:31:18] in other words I'll hope you catch this
[1:31:20] I'm just take a little liberty with
[1:31:21] times years dates Etc
[1:31:24] but you take a hybrid
[1:31:26] and you cross this male parent plant and
[1:31:30] this female parrot plant and you end up
[1:31:32] with a seed
[1:31:34] then you take that and you take that
[1:31:37] plant which now have very strong traits
[1:31:39] and you now cross-breed it with another
[1:31:43] plant and you end up with a seed and
[1:31:45] man's been messing around with this amen
[1:31:47] and that's why oh I hope I don't hurt
[1:31:49] nobody feelings uh y'all a bunch of
[1:31:51] hybrid
[1:31:54] because your great Grampy was this
[1:31:58] your grandma was French and then it was
[1:32:00] this and then it was that and then they
[1:32:03] met here and they met there and come and
[1:32:05] and uh you know our family
[1:32:09] I I wished I never got involved with
[1:32:11] this genealogy stuff
[1:32:14] I've been told since I was this high
[1:32:16] our family behaves this way because
[1:32:18] we're German
[1:32:20] so I just like accepted that Germans are
[1:32:23] stubborn hard-headed like to argue
[1:32:26] absolutely that's what Germans are and
[1:32:29] so I'm Justified
[1:32:31] sister Jerry's like come on please do
[1:32:32] this genealogy thing do ancestry
[1:32:34] ancestry you know there's so little
[1:32:36] German in me
[1:32:39] so little German in me I had to find a
[1:32:42] new excuse why I'm stubborn and
[1:32:44] hard-headed and I I would have been
[1:32:46] happy just to kept the old excuse
[1:32:49] then I realized maybe I am like I am
[1:32:51] because it's not about my genealogy but
[1:32:54] it's about something else amen
[1:32:57] we'll elect to have something to fall
[1:33:00] back on I'm gonna fall back on this you
[1:33:03] know it's this and it's that no my
[1:33:05] brother and sister we're the elect lady
[1:33:07] I want you to go ahead and trace your
[1:33:09] genealogy today
[1:33:14] your genealogy did not come out of the
[1:33:16] pits of hell
[1:33:18] your genealogy did not come from Cain
[1:33:21] your genealogy was not there in
[1:33:24] Sadducees and Pharisees your genealogy
[1:33:28] came from the very Throne of almighty
[1:33:31] God and we got to stop and start
[1:33:34] recognizing if I'm behaving and blaming
[1:33:37] it on something else I need to get down
[1:33:39] and repent and say Lord it is not an
[1:33:42] excuse that I'm looking for I'm looking
[1:33:44] for answers in my life I'm looking for
[1:33:47] deliverances in my life I'm looking to
[1:33:49] satisfy the hunger in my life
[1:33:52] now we figured out the the discrepancy
[1:33:55] you might say
[1:33:56] we had Scandinavian and English and
[1:34:00] whatever else but somehow or another
[1:34:02] they ended up living there in the
[1:34:04] Borderlands of Germany maybe they just
[1:34:07] took on the spirit and kept it
[1:34:10] the only spirit I really want to take on
[1:34:12] is the Holy Spirit
[1:34:14] I don't want it to just anoint My Flesh
[1:34:15] I want to keep it
[1:34:17] I want to live all the days of my life
[1:34:19] under that anointing but you see you
[1:34:21] come and we can say well they came from
[1:34:23] here they came from there this happened
[1:34:24] that happened and that's our excuse
[1:34:26] that's our reason my brother and sister
[1:34:28] just let me expound on this if we do
[1:34:31] that we have no hope let's just dismiss
[1:34:32] right now and go home because we are
[1:34:34] right here under the influence of
[1:34:37] Satan's Eden and if we're going to say
[1:34:39] it's because where I live
[1:34:41] where you live in laodicea
[1:34:44] so why don't we all start by going to
[1:34:46] the store
[1:34:47] and buy an ice cream and Oreos
[1:34:49] because we got no other hope
[1:34:53] but my lineage
[1:34:55] my lineage
[1:34:58] my Esther anointing
[1:35:02] says I
[1:35:03] am the wife
[1:35:06] I'm not just a queen
[1:35:07] I'm the wife
[1:35:09] of the king
[1:35:11] and as a wife
[1:35:13] when we took vows
[1:35:16] he said he'd never forsake me
[1:35:21] be put in the back of the concubine
[1:35:23] house over here never be seen again no
[1:35:25] sir he said I'll never leave you I'll
[1:35:27] never forsake you I'm not afraid of my
[1:35:30] God even if I make a mistake I'm not
[1:35:31] afraid of my God putting me to the side
[1:35:33] and banishing me from this because he
[1:35:36] made come on Saints he made the same vow
[1:35:41] to you that you made to him
[1:35:46] oh I'll tell you what my brother and
[1:35:48] sister we gotta look at this
[1:35:50] amen now look at this I got sidetracked
[1:35:52] what happens here now so we have had
[1:35:54] seven generations I hope you catch this
[1:35:57] I'm typing it this way on purpose we've
[1:35:58] had seven generations of hybriding
[1:36:02] amen the word of God clearly shows us
[1:36:04] the prophet confirms that that no uh
[1:36:07] that Christ hadn't even been taken from
[1:36:09] the scene been sacrificed at Calvary and
[1:36:12] those Spirits were already moving in
[1:36:14] we've had seven generations of a high
[1:36:18] breeding of the word of God my brother
[1:36:20] and sister and you look but somewhere
[1:36:23] now the prophet of God ties it back just
[1:36:25] right after the Dark Ages the moving of
[1:36:27] Luther and Pentecost and Wesley all of
[1:36:30] this that God started to really you
[1:36:33] might say separate the wheat and the
[1:36:35] tares and so as it was while the
[1:36:38] generations went on hybriding the word
[1:36:41] of God Amen you look and find that the
[1:36:44] regressive Gene showed up
[1:36:48] are you following me the regressive Gene
[1:36:51] now you could speak this and people and
[1:36:52] say what are you doing well I'm telling
[1:36:54] you here it is I want to just be
[1:36:56] transparent amen from that point amen a
[1:37:00] day of Pentecost experience the high
[1:37:04] breeding stopped amongst the elect lady
[1:37:06] and every age for Seven Ages while the
[1:37:10] high breeding was developing and
[1:37:13] creating something that was not
[1:37:15] sustainable with no life can't grow on
[1:37:17] its own but man keeps his hand on it man
[1:37:20] keeps inserting life in it he keeps
[1:37:22] putting another gene into it it puts
[1:37:24] another thing to it oh at a Creed here
[1:37:27] or we can't trust the people we've got
[1:37:29] to add a law we got to add this got to
[1:37:31] add a membership but over here this High
[1:37:34] breeding is now broken and Seven Ages of
[1:37:39] regression because a corn plant
[1:37:44] in a few Generations
[1:37:47] will regress back to its dominant gene
[1:37:56] are you with me
[1:37:59] Seven Ages
[1:38:02] coming back
[1:38:04] to the dominant
[1:38:06] Gene
[1:38:08] and here we are today my brother and
[1:38:10] sister we're not hybrid to this we're
[1:38:13] not hybrid to that we're not hybrid to a
[1:38:16] program we have come back to the
[1:38:18] dominant gene the male Alpha Gene Jesus
[1:38:22] Christ amen we have come back to that
[1:38:25] while they were moving in a greater
[1:38:27] hybrid uh Direction uh another
[1:38:30] perversion as it were and it's there's
[1:38:32] what was happening the bride nobody made
[1:38:34] a great to do oh
[1:38:38] happened was is the seed produced and
[1:38:40] the scripture says it went to the ground
[1:38:42] and it has to go into the ground and die
[1:38:44] or it can't bring life so we see it's
[1:38:48] rising up the cycle repeating nothing
[1:38:51] significant about that if you just look
[1:38:53] from the surface
[1:38:55] but every time the seed went in the
[1:38:57] ground there was something inside that
[1:38:59] scene
[1:39:00] that said
[1:39:01] I want to be the original
[1:39:04] I want the life of my fathers
[1:39:07] I want the life
[1:39:09] I don't need pomp I don't need
[1:39:11] circumstance I don't need all of this I
[1:39:13] want life and that plant grew and
[1:39:16] without an outside influence
[1:39:18] other than catch this
[1:39:20] without the rain
[1:39:23] and without the sun that's right
[1:39:26] that seed went down
[1:39:28] grew
[1:39:30] produced seed again
[1:39:37] on Wednesday night here recently I
[1:39:39] preached about the lepers
[1:39:41] ten lepers
[1:39:44] by God's grace there was
[1:39:48] one in Fellowship here in the church
[1:39:49] that was having question and God dealt
[1:39:51] with it you see that's why my brother
[1:39:52] and sister when the seed comes up
[1:39:56] you stand from here to the back of the
[1:39:58] church
[1:39:59] just looks like a corn plant
[1:40:05] worshiping
[1:40:08] but they're producing different seed
[1:40:10] one's going back to the original
[1:40:12] one it being further hybrid
[1:40:16] I watched
[1:40:18] should I name it probably not polite to
[1:40:20] name it I watched a very large
[1:40:22] denomination in the world
[1:40:24] a funeral of one of their ministers
[1:40:29] and I was stunned
[1:40:31] for all their fine robes
[1:40:33] when they showed a picture of this
[1:40:35] Minister this woman
[1:40:38] without all the robes on without all the
[1:40:40] stuff
[1:40:42] a picture
[1:40:45] and a comment below the picture was
[1:40:47] the best punk rock pastor
[1:40:50] ever
[1:40:54] I'm not being derogatory I want to make
[1:40:56] a point to you
[1:40:58] the hybriding
[1:41:00] that individual can now go out in the
[1:41:03] punk rock world
[1:41:05] and walk in
[1:41:06] and fit perfectly
[1:41:09] Sunday can go to church
[1:41:13] put on their Minister robes
[1:41:16] and fit in perfectly
[1:41:19] why because both are hybrid
[1:41:25] had a minister brother I hope you guys
[1:41:27] don't think I've just lost my mind here
[1:41:29] today had a minister brother and I was
[1:41:31] joking one time
[1:41:33] he said I I wonder brother Paul what
[1:41:35] would happen if I on a Sunday morning
[1:41:37] you know I went down here to one of
[1:41:38] these stores you know and they have
[1:41:40] these tattoos that you can just you know
[1:41:42] spray mist on and
[1:41:44] it looks like the real thing
[1:41:46] he said I just wonder what the church
[1:41:48] would do if on a Sunday morning I comb
[1:41:50] my hair straight forward and come out
[1:41:52] and I had all this I just wonder what
[1:41:54] they would do
[1:41:55] I said do you really want to find out
[1:41:57] and he goes nah the parking lot's pretty
[1:41:59] hard
[1:42:04] you see there's no way the elect lady
[1:42:07] can exist in a hybrid world
[1:42:10] and come back to the house of God and
[1:42:12] say we have the original seed
[1:42:15] The Original Seed produces the Original
[1:42:17] Seed and when it goes in the ground
[1:42:19] every generation coming forward is pure
[1:42:23] is getting pure is going back to the
[1:42:26] original until it comes where the
[1:42:28] prophet of God said they'll stand in the
[1:42:30] presence of God as they was when he
[1:42:34] spoke them into existence
[1:42:37] oh Hallelujah isn't that beautiful amen
[1:42:40] the select lady what is it it's not our
[1:42:43] righteousness but we are believers and
[1:42:46] we stand up and we speak out I believe
[1:42:49] the word and God is counting
[1:42:51] righteousness to you and I day after day
[1:42:54] after day and we think we're just living
[1:42:57] I just raising my family brother Paul I
[1:43:00] just go to work we go to church we're
[1:43:02] just doing what you don't realize is
[1:43:05] that just living God is giving
[1:43:07] righteousness and accounting
[1:43:08] righteousness and you're a count full of
[1:43:10] righteousness is getting Fuller and
[1:43:13] Fuller and Fuller because we have been
[1:43:16] given a gift the seed placed in you and
[1:43:19] I is a seed that can only say Amen to
[1:43:21] the word and it will say Amen to the
[1:43:24] word it won't sit silent amen I'm not
[1:43:27] talking about how to speak out vocal but
[1:43:29] in the heart saying that's the truth I
[1:43:32] believe that hallelujah amen now I'm I'm
[1:43:37] so far I I haven't even hardly got
[1:43:40] started I'm sorry
[1:43:42] amen
[1:43:45] brother but I'm talking in the pergament
[1:43:48] church age I'll just paraphrase this to
[1:43:51] you he says one night I was seeking the
[1:43:53] Lord the Holy Spirit told me pick up my
[1:43:55] pen and write and as I grasp the PIN to
[1:43:58] write his Spirit gave me a message for
[1:44:00] the church I want to bring it to you it
[1:44:02] has to do with the word and the bride
[1:44:06] do we got time enough I can just read
[1:44:07] this it isn't that long amen and here's
[1:44:10] what I'm trying to say to you the law of
[1:44:13] reproduction is that each specie brings
[1:44:16] forth after its own kind even according
[1:44:19] to Genesis 1 11 God said let the Earth
[1:44:22] bring forth grass and Herb yielding seed
[1:44:25] and the fruit tree yielding fruit after
[1:44:27] his kind whose seed is
[1:44:35] I have to go out and find a seed I don't
[1:44:38] have to start looking under the bench I
[1:44:40] don't have to go here go to Revival over
[1:44:42] there that seed is in me Hallelujah I
[1:44:47] cannot produce anything else but that
[1:44:51] seed
[1:44:52] oh Hallelujah
[1:44:55] oh my
[1:44:57] amen that is seed is in itself upon the
[1:45:02] Earth and it was soul and whatever life
[1:45:04] was in the seed came forth into the
[1:45:06] plant and thence into the fruit the very
[1:45:08] same law applies to the church
[1:45:11] oh Hallelujah come on Saints I could
[1:45:14] come here and read every how to preach
[1:45:17] inspirationally every book they have on
[1:45:20] that go to seminars I could come here
[1:45:22] but if the inspiration or life of the
[1:45:25] word is not in this church
[1:45:29] it won't produce
[1:45:32] somebody to say thank you Lord for the
[1:45:34] life
[1:45:35] no my goodness my brother and sister
[1:45:37] whatever seed started the church will
[1:45:40] come forth be like the Original Seed
[1:45:42] because it's the same seed
[1:45:46] now how many of you touched denomination
[1:45:48] at some point in your life
[1:45:53] if that was the seed that was in you you
[1:45:55] wouldn't be here this morning
[1:45:57] you might have set in denomination
[1:46:00] and they might have tried to give you
[1:46:01] the hybrid
[1:46:03] Doctrine
[1:46:04] with a hybrid teaching hybrid spirit
[1:46:09] but somehow it never grew
[1:46:13] I remember one time a man saying oh I
[1:46:15] just would that God would just pour seed
[1:46:16] down on me and it would just all grow
[1:46:18] I think it was the Lord because I was
[1:46:20] like man some of the seed I'm around I
[1:46:23] do not want in my life Lord I do not
[1:46:24] want that to grow you know amen I know
[1:46:28] none of none of you it's only people
[1:46:30] like me ever attempted to lie ever get
[1:46:33] angry ever kick tires
[1:46:36] ever stop on a ditch bank and throw
[1:46:37] rocks
[1:46:40] I know you guys are above that
[1:46:42] and why you ever elected a pastor that's
[1:46:44] not above that I don't know but I tell
[1:46:47] you what I have to go out there with
[1:46:49] some spiritual Roundup and I have to say
[1:46:52] Lord I need this
[1:46:54] and I just watch these things just all
[1:46:56] Wilt and go away
[1:46:58] but I tell you what if I'm sitting on
[1:47:00] the recliner
[1:47:01] that doesn't get sprayed
[1:47:03] those Spirits don't go away
[1:47:05] and pretty soon
[1:47:07] I'm the only one that's right in the
[1:47:09] message and you all are wrong
[1:47:12] and if y'all don't line up with me well
[1:47:14] you know where you're going
[1:47:16] because I'm going to be in heaven
[1:47:19] no no my brother and sister God wants us
[1:47:23] to come and recognize that the seed that
[1:47:26] God was so gracious to place in you and
[1:47:29] I is going to come
[1:47:31] and you see you look out have you ever
[1:47:34] met people on the workplace Neighbors
[1:47:37] very Godly people
[1:47:40] very Godly people good people caring
[1:47:43] giving
[1:47:45] what separates you from them
[1:47:48] Doctrine
[1:47:51] seed
[1:47:52] that's the only thing that separates you
[1:47:55] because if you and your flesh had that
[1:47:57] seed you would be that
[1:47:58] you and your flesh have this seed and
[1:48:01] you are this amen and how it is that God
[1:48:04] wants to water that seed and wants you
[1:48:06] to come with a strength and have a
[1:48:09] belief in that amen and in these last
[1:48:11] days the true broad Church Christ seed
[1:48:13] in parentheses will come to The
[1:48:15] Headstone and she will be the Super
[1:48:18] church I'm telling you right now I'm
[1:48:20] gonna just boast a little bit on you and
[1:48:22] me amen my brother and sister were
[1:48:24] sitting here this morning the world
[1:48:26] won't think much of you and I but we are
[1:48:28] a super church amen I didn't say mega
[1:48:31] church I said super church amen because
[1:48:34] the seed that has been placed in you and
[1:48:38] I has to come to life do we believe hey
[1:48:41] we are in the message church right so
[1:48:43] that means we believe the message amen I
[1:48:46] don't want to be a Lutheran in a
[1:48:47] Methodist Church
[1:48:48] and I don't want to be a message
[1:48:50] believer in a Lutheran Church either
[1:48:52] because I just don't know how you deal
[1:48:54] with that
[1:48:56] I just don't know I don't know how you
[1:48:58] deal with it
[1:49:00] and the bride will be so much
[1:49:02] oh let me go back I love that so much I
[1:49:04] just have to read it again these last
[1:49:06] days the true bride Church Christ seed
[1:49:08] will come to The Headstone and she will
[1:49:10] be the not a or part of she will be the
[1:49:14] Super Church a super race as she nears
[1:49:18] him
[1:49:22] we sing this song
[1:49:23] or it gets sung Here Comes the Bride
[1:49:27] my brother and sister
[1:49:30] the bride doesn't stay out there
[1:49:33] I tell you what speak the vows
[1:49:36] I'm over here already enjoying the cake
[1:49:39] um
[1:49:40] yeah
[1:49:42] no sir she comes to him
[1:49:44] you realize that's why in the vows
[1:49:47] the man
[1:49:48] always comes out first
[1:49:51] you guys knew that right
[1:49:55] right
[1:49:57] why
[1:49:58] because even back to ancient times
[1:50:02] the wife
[1:50:03] came to the husband amen
[1:50:06] not
[1:50:07] 2023
[1:50:10] 2023
[1:50:12] oh this happened just recently she wore
[1:50:15] a toxin he wore
[1:50:16] a wedding gown
[1:50:23] let's not even go there
[1:50:25] so the bride is coming
[1:50:27] to the bridegroom
[1:50:29] and in that right
[1:50:32] the bride will be so much like him that
[1:50:34] they will even be in his very image this
[1:50:38] is in order to be United with him they
[1:50:42] will be one
[1:50:44] my brother and sister you cannot oh I
[1:50:47] tell you you can put a square peg in a
[1:50:49] round hole if the round hole is big
[1:50:51] enough
[1:50:52] amen so it's not that this is a perfect
[1:50:56] fit the image of Jesus Christ and his
[1:51:00] pride a perfect image
[1:51:04] oh are we going to be come let's let's
[1:51:06] have just a little moment
[1:51:08] Bible study whatever you want to call it
[1:51:11] okay how many believe when the Rapture
[1:51:14] comes we're all going to be perfect
[1:51:23] wow
[1:51:25] nobody perfect here
[1:51:28] good I'm glad you believe that
[1:51:31] because you see
[1:51:33] perfection
[1:51:35] is not in the brine
[1:51:37] it's in the bridegroom
[1:51:41] but he brings us into his image
[1:51:46] of who he is we are not vashti we are
[1:51:55] Esther
[1:51:59] Hallelujah
[1:52:01] what was it Esther had Liberty because
[1:52:03] she was the image of her husband
[1:52:06] and she knew his will
[1:52:09] oh I could I could go and look up some
[1:52:12] things right here that fit so perfect
[1:52:13] but excuse me amen now look at this the
[1:52:17] bride will be so much like him it will
[1:52:19] even be in his very image this is in
[1:52:20] order to be United with him they will be
[1:52:25] one they will be the very manifestation
[1:52:27] of the word of a living God
[1:52:29] denominations cannot produce this wrong
[1:52:33] seed they will produce their Creed and
[1:52:35] their Dogma mixed with the word this
[1:52:37] mongrelizing brings forth a hybrid
[1:52:40] product
[1:52:42] oh my goodness
[1:52:44] oh my goodness
[1:52:48] Sister Sarah just come
[1:52:51] amen
[1:52:52] you see
[1:52:53] by going back
[1:52:58] the bride is going back
[1:53:01] now you say this and some people say no
[1:53:03] she's not yes she is she's going back
[1:53:06] the bride is going back my brother and
[1:53:08] sister
[1:53:09] to the original word
[1:53:12] and in going back to the original word
[1:53:14] she's moving forward does that make
[1:53:17] sense
[1:53:18] amen she went back to the original word
[1:53:20] and that moved her forward and every
[1:53:22] time that we put everything aside and go
[1:53:25] back to the original word we move
[1:53:27] forward that's why we are constantly in
[1:53:31] this oscillation moving forward
[1:53:33] seemingly going back a little bit moving
[1:53:35] forward because we have to stop and go
[1:53:37] back to the word to move forward and the
[1:53:40] growth pattern amen that is in the
[1:53:43] church has always been of the ages has
[1:53:46] always been an oscillation of great
[1:53:49] faith amen signs and wonders in their
[1:53:52] midst and then seemingly slumping down
[1:53:55] and then God comes on the scene I've got
[1:53:57] quote for this if you need it God comes
[1:53:58] on the scene and they are getting
[1:54:00] lukewarm the Amber is going out God
[1:54:03] allows that to happen and then he lights
[1:54:07] the fire again and the church surges
[1:54:09] forward past where they were before and
[1:54:11] they're hot for a season and then they
[1:54:13] cool down and this is this this is what
[1:54:16] God is allowing to happen the church in
[1:54:19] this oscillation moving amen growing
[1:54:21] amen and you know have you ever heard
[1:54:23] the phrase I'm sick and tired of being
[1:54:25] sick and tired
[1:54:26] I'll tell you what this bride is getting
[1:54:28] sick and tired of Satan's influence in
[1:54:31] her life she's getting sick and tired of
[1:54:34] Satan having influenced my brother and
[1:54:36] sister and she's coming to the place
[1:54:38] that she's saying Lord if I have to go
[1:54:41] back and I need to find a place Lord or
[1:54:44] maybe I stepped away from the word I'll
[1:54:46] go back to that place Lord because I
[1:54:48] have to move forward I've got to move
[1:54:50] forward in this word and my brother and
[1:54:53] sister I'm going to stop right there
[1:54:54] because
[1:54:56] I'm halfway
[1:54:58] my
[1:54:59] [Music]
[1:55:05] can we consolidate this Wednesday and
[1:55:08] call it
[1:55:09] I'll take a Sunday afternoon somewhere
[1:55:12] [Music]
[1:55:18] brother Kim and I was talking about this
[1:55:20] last night
[1:55:22] interesting enough brother Kim I didn't
[1:55:23] make the comment at that time
[1:55:26] but here it is my sermon
[1:55:29] when we're talking about the hearts
[1:55:31] being turned back
[1:55:33] stalking literal
[1:55:36] this is not a cliche
[1:55:39] this is not words that we throw out and
[1:55:41] say oh the hearts are going to be turned
[1:55:42] back and we all just go on acting like
[1:55:44] everything's just fine
[1:55:46] this is a real changing this is a real
[1:55:50] sifting my brother and sister of the
[1:55:53] chaff and the wheat it's not good you
[1:55:56] realize they took those Forks in those
[1:55:57] days and they threw the wheat
[1:56:01] up in the air in the breeze the wind
[1:56:03] blew it away and you think well the wind
[1:56:05] blew it away but I'm telling you as a
[1:56:08] farmer when them men walked away from
[1:56:10] the thrashing floor every day
[1:56:14] they had all
[1:56:16] of the husk and Terror
[1:56:20] all over them
[1:56:23] and they were dirty
[1:56:25] it wasn't a clean job
[1:56:27] [Music]
[1:56:30] with the headwind
[1:56:34] wheat
[1:56:36] was all that mattered
[1:56:39] and God realizes in our effort to serve
[1:56:43] him
[1:56:44] we get some laodicea on us
[1:56:47] [Music]
[1:56:49] but he's not looking at laodicea
[1:56:51] he's looking in wheat and we in our on
[1:56:57] fire
[1:56:58] a little cooled off and on fire and a
[1:57:01] little cooled off the prophet of God
[1:57:04] said that's God's plan my brother and
[1:57:07] sister I want to just encourage each and
[1:57:09] every one of you
[1:57:10] don't stop at the mistake
[1:57:14] amen the mistake is just God's way of
[1:57:17] bringing our attention to something in
[1:57:20] our life that he wants us to deal with
[1:57:23] amen
[1:57:25] he wants you and I I'm going to cut out
[1:57:27] a whole bunch of this so if it seems
[1:57:29] like a big gap here he wants you and I
[1:57:31] to keep one believing keep on speaking
[1:57:37] because there he is counting
[1:57:40] righteousness to the black lady can we
[1:57:44] say Lord I believe
[1:57:46] amen Lord count to me as righteousness
[1:57:49] Lord I want to stand for your word and
[1:57:51] even when I see it's hard even when I'm
[1:57:54] struggling Lord let something within me
[1:57:57] just say Lord I believe
[1:58:00] amen and count it to me is righteousness
[1:58:02] Lord not for righteousness because our
[1:58:05] righteousness is filthy rags but his
[1:58:07] righteousness my brother and sister is
[1:58:10] accounted and stands the test of time
[1:58:13] Hallelujah that we can stand before him
[1:58:15] and say Lord I've done my best amen
[1:58:18] let's just stand my brothers and sisters
[1:58:20] just Worship the Lord for a minute amen
[1:58:22] hallelujah I really wanted to get to
[1:58:25] this part so I'll just give you the
[1:58:26] bearish Glimpse as you look through this
[1:58:28] amen being fully persuaded verse 20 21
[1:58:32] 22 23 says he staggered not amen and
[1:58:36] through unbelief but was strong and
[1:58:37] giving glory to God being fully
[1:58:40] persuaded that God was able that he had
[1:58:42] promised he's able to perform it that
[1:58:45] was imputed to him for righteousness
[1:58:46] amen do you realize my brother and
[1:58:49] sister that's you right here in
[1:58:51] scripture we're not afraid of this world
[1:58:54] Amen we're not going to fall down under
[1:58:56] fear and anxiety what's going to happen
[1:58:59] what if they drop the does the bride go
[1:59:01] before they drop the bomb does she go
[1:59:03] right after does it go during what what
[1:59:06] is happening my brother and sister this
[1:59:08] stirs people's hearts and causes them
[1:59:10] anxiety well I'll tell you what why
[1:59:13] don't we get in Christ and whenever he
[1:59:15] takes us we go
[1:59:18] amen it won't have to do with what the
[1:59:20] government over here the river Euphrates
[1:59:22] you know how many hits is on the
[1:59:23] internet now about the Euphrates drying
[1:59:25] up it's going wild millions of people oh
