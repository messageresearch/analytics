[50:42] ballots
[50:43] uh for the affirmation of offices will
[50:47] be handed out at the end of service uh
[50:49] you do not have to worry about filling
[50:51] them out today just sometime and uh the
[50:56] next week or two you can just place them
[50:59] in the offering basket and the brothers
[51:03] will deal accordingly amen I want to
[51:06] speak to you today you know it's um
[51:09] sometimes God just uh I'm just very
[51:11] moved by the song service Myself by the
[51:14] prayer over the request because you see
[51:17] many times God just gives us words of
[51:21] affirmation just reminds us he speaks to
[51:24] us the certain thoughts that you've been
[51:26] having something you might have read and
[51:29] then it is spoken or touched upon and
[51:31] you realize okay we are in the mind of
[51:34] Christ he is dealing with us as a people
[51:37] and we are very blessed and speaking of
[51:40] being blessed our our brother Jake
[51:43] uh travel all the way from Twin Falls
[51:47] you know Uber might have been cheaper
[51:50] than a Peterbilt but uh uh but he drove
[51:53] up one to be in church today and we're
[51:54] happy for that and
[51:56] um amen our sister Alice and sister
[51:58] Andrea and uh I I they didn't come to
[52:02] see their daughter their sister they
[52:04] come to see us uh so but we're just so
[52:07] happy it's like they're like family and
[52:09] and each and every one amen just so
[52:12] happy to have all of you here today uh
[52:15] God rich and mercy Amen to to bring that
[52:19] and uh God bless you brother Paul and
[52:21] your family amen good to see you today
[52:24] uh but uh you know it's raining a little
[52:28] bit outside but that just makes the the
[52:30] sun shine brighter on the inside amen
[52:34] and we're happy amen I want to speak to
[52:37] you today on The Measure of a Man uh you
[52:40] know it's quite interesting how God
[52:42] works I I went to bed last night with
[52:45] some of these same same thoughts but
[52:48] woke up and
[52:51] um just the Lord just dealt uh I
[52:53] concerned kindly and I hope today that I
[52:56] can I can share that Lord just speaking
[52:58] to my heart last night and so as we look
[53:01] at this we want to take as it is the
[53:04] measure of a man and realize that this
[53:06] is not to the man gender but to mankind
[53:11] uh the body of Christ the body of
[53:13] Believers amen so if we'll just turn in
[53:16] our Bibles to a very very uh well-known
[53:20] very uh often read a bit of scripture in
[53:25] Romans 12 and uh you know it's there
[53:28] that we we just the Lord just spoke to
[53:31] me through this scripture and I pray
[53:33] that I can just uh convey this and and
[53:37] uh
[53:39] in a beneficial way you know that you'd
[53:42] go away and say that was good amen
[53:44] Romans 12 1-5
[53:48] I beseech thee therefore
[53:50] brethren
[53:52] so he has identified who he's speaking
[53:54] to he's not he's not talking to the
[53:56] people down in the marketplace or the
[53:58] court is talking to uh the body of
[54:01] Believers amen I beseech you therefore
[54:04] Brethren by the mercies of God that you
[54:07] present your bodies a Living Sacrifice
[54:09] holy acceptable unto God
[54:13] and I I'm not going to preach down this
[54:15] line so I want to make this comment kind
[54:18] of tying back to Wednesday night
[54:20] Satan wants to throw our flesh
[54:23] into the Limelight
[54:26] that we would convince ourselves that
[54:28] we're not acceptable
[54:32] now if you can get somebody to be so
[54:34] anointed to pick a fight
[54:37] and you just get to stand back and watch
[54:39] them fight
[54:40] my that's the ultimate and Satan then
[54:43] plants a seed
[54:45] and watches us fight
[54:48] and what are we fighting actually
[54:50] against the word that is written of us
[54:55] so we're denying the very word of God
[54:57] that God said
[54:59] and Satan can then step back and just
[55:02] watch us fight
[55:04] well we're here to let Satan know that
[55:07] no longer are we going to fight his
[55:09] fight for him
[55:12] amen
[55:16] acceptable unto God which is your
[55:18] reasonable service and be not conformed
[55:21] to this world but be transformed by the
[55:23] renewing of your mind that you may prove
[55:26] what is that good and acceptable and
[55:30] perfect will of God for I say through
[55:33] the grace given unto me to every man
[55:35] that is among you not to think of
[55:37] himself more highly than he ought to
[55:39] think but to think soberly according as
[55:42] God hath dealt to every man The Measure
[55:46] of Faith for as we have many members in
[55:49] one body and all members have not the
[55:52] same office
[55:54] so we being many
[55:56] are one body in Christ
[56:00] and everyone
[56:02] members of one another
[56:07] so when Satan can come and cause us to
[56:09] war against the word
[56:11] we're actually separating ourself out of
[56:15] the body
[56:16] so it's not just our internal battle
[56:18] that we fight
[56:22] and sorry for a very poor analogy
[56:24] but if some member of your physical body
[56:27] was separated from you right now
[56:31] it would affect the whole body
[56:34] so when Satan convinces one to war
[56:37] against themselves against the word
[56:39] he's affected
[56:41] the whole body
[56:43] Heavenly Father we ask you Lord Jesus
[56:46] Lord just come and speak to our hearts
[56:49] today and make this word so real make it
[56:52] so living father that we can't live
[56:55] without it that it becomes our very
[56:57] thought the very substance of our being
[57:00] our very strength father
[57:03] and also our vision
[57:06] your word says that without a vision the
[57:08] people perish but father this Vision
[57:10] might not be a vision for the bride of
[57:12] Christ it might be for just a member of
[57:15] that body
[57:17] Lord let us have the correct vision Lord
[57:19] to see you and Lord let this body Lord
[57:23] Jesus let it be father that we could
[57:26] come today and by your grace father we
[57:30] could take measure of ourselves by the
[57:33] word of God by the anointing of your
[57:35] Holy Spirit Lord that we could stand and
[57:38] say truly I am a member of this great
[57:41] and glorious body bless the time
[57:44] together today Lord in your precious
[57:46] name amen you may be seated
[57:59] it is my brother and sister that I would
[58:02] like to just start by the definition of
[58:04] maze measure it is a mount on a degree
[58:08] of something
[58:10] uh something used to measure things a
[58:13] unit used in measuring and it could also
[58:16] be described as a suitable limit and so
[58:20] we would look at this today my brother
[58:22] and realize that the limit that God has
[58:25] given to the bride of Christ is the full
[58:28] word of God Amen we can say well I I'm
[58:31] just going to limit what I do you know
[58:34] if I used to drink two soda pops a day
[58:37] I'm gonna drink one it still isn't good
[58:39] for us amen amen my crusade I'm I'm
[58:43] becoming more and more of an anti soda
[58:45] pop you know but we won't put it in our
[58:47] covenants or anything here in the church
[58:50] but look at this my brother and sister
[58:51] sometimes our idea of what we're
[58:54] limiting or majoring or doing is still
[58:57] insufficient it still is either too far
[59:00] one way or not far enough another and we
[59:03] realize that what we're looking for and
[59:06] the songs that we sang uh this morning
[59:08] really touched my heart because you see
[59:11] my brother and sister what God is doing
[59:13] he's pouring out a measure and the
[59:15] scripture says that he's given to every
[59:18] man a Measure of Faith now my brother
[59:20] and sister you would look and say well
[59:22] this brother has great faith well I'm
[59:24] here to tell you that the measure that
[59:26] God poured out to you was sufficient for
[59:30] your life amen it isn't that it seems as
[59:33] though this one has a greater Measure of
[59:36] Faith but God said I know what they will
[59:39] face and I know what you will face and I
[59:42] have given you a measure that is
[59:44] sufficient and we'll hit upon this and
[59:46] why I I want to put it this way in just
[59:49] a little bit but you see my brother and
[59:52] sister this measure God has given us is
[59:55] a measure of what God has given us
[59:59] it's not what the message as it were
[1:00:01] like meaning a church and all of this it
[1:00:04] isn't what this person and that person
[1:00:06] has given to you but it's what God has
[1:00:08] given and so we will see today in this
[1:00:11] thought for just a little while many
[1:00:13] references of a measure and I took these
[1:00:17] by going through the message and uh just
[1:00:21] taking phrases as it were words that the
[1:00:23] prophet of God now I didn't take all of
[1:00:25] them uh because we certainly uh you know
[1:00:28] would need a lot more time but brother
[1:00:30] Branham makes these references down
[1:00:33] through the message and one of the first
[1:00:36] ones that comes up is the measure of
[1:00:38] time and so we have been given a measure
[1:00:42] of time and in that we realize the
[1:00:45] scripture has declared that each every
[1:00:47] one of us has been allotted a certain
[1:00:49] amount of days amen and we've been given
[1:00:51] a measure of Grace and I say thank you
[1:00:55] Lord and the word says his grace is
[1:00:58] sufficient so that measure here again is
[1:01:02] sufficient for everything that you and I
[1:01:05] will face in our life we can't say oh my
[1:01:08] I've used up all my grace I have sinned
[1:01:12] my grace away I've consumed it my
[1:01:15] brother and sister God has never given a
[1:01:17] short measure Amen in fact the scripture
[1:01:20] talks about an unjust balance and God
[1:01:22] would not hold an unjust balance to such
[1:01:25] a position if he was going to turn
[1:01:27] around and be an unjust balance so it's
[1:01:30] there that we realize that whatever
[1:01:31] happens in our life that the grace we've
[1:01:34] been given the measure of it is
[1:01:36] sufficient the prophet of God says that
[1:01:38] there's a measure of God and we we won't
[1:01:41] go through each one of these to to lay
[1:01:44] that Foundation you have access amen and
[1:01:47] then he comes and speaks of a Measure of
[1:01:49] Faith now my brother and sister are
[1:01:52] often times we'll put Faith as a higher
[1:01:55] level but you know the word tells us to
[1:01:57] be good stewards of our time as I
[1:01:59] already said he says that the grace he
[1:02:01] has given is sufficient and he's our God
[1:02:04] Amen some people get a little confused
[1:02:06] they say well is it God is it Jesus
[1:02:08] Christ is it the Holy Ghost the prophet
[1:02:10] of God said they're all the same amen
[1:02:12] this is all the same so whether you use
[1:02:16] this phrase or this phrase and you know
[1:02:18] some people say Lord bless you amen I by
[1:02:21] habit I guess say God bless you now my
[1:02:24] brother and sister if one says Lord
[1:02:26] bless you and I say God bless you we're
[1:02:28] saying the same thing amen but people
[1:02:31] get caught up in verbiage and and they
[1:02:33] just not let they didn't say that right
[1:02:35] I don't know that I can agree they
[1:02:36] didn't say that right well let's make
[1:02:38] sure we took it back to the word and
[1:02:41] balanced it before we decide the wrong
[1:02:43] amen and so it is that we look at this
[1:02:46] this Measure of Faith we oftentimes talk
[1:02:50] faith is a very common subject now
[1:02:53] amongst uh Christians and and it's there
[1:02:56] that we talk about Lord increase my
[1:02:58] faith do you realize my brother and
[1:03:00] sister before the foundation of the
[1:03:01] world God gave you every drop of faith
[1:03:03] you'll ever have prophet of God using
[1:03:05] the example of every Apple that was ever
[1:03:07] going to be in that tree was in that
[1:03:10] tree when it was still a seed amen so
[1:03:13] the faith that God wanted you to have
[1:03:16] has already been given to you what we're
[1:03:19] working on is releasing the faith amen
[1:03:21] setting the atmosphere that faith can
[1:03:24] actually work amen so we can't lead
[1:03:27] living or dwelling or fellowshipping in
[1:03:29] a realm of Doubt where people say well
[1:03:31] we don't think brother random meant it
[1:03:33] that way even though he said it that way
[1:03:35] and my brother and sister what it is is
[1:03:38] Satan is undermining your faith in the
[1:03:40] word that you now start to judge and and
[1:03:43] they start doing this you know I find
[1:03:45] this interesting I'm just going to throw
[1:03:47] this out I hope you don't mind but you
[1:03:49] know you deal with somebody and you know
[1:03:51] they say well you know that's that's uh
[1:03:55] that's how you see the message
[1:03:59] my brother and sister
[1:04:01] if they can get you to question
[1:04:06] revelation
[1:04:10] you see your job
[1:04:12] is to run it through the filter of the
[1:04:14] word
[1:04:16] I can't run it through the filter for
[1:04:18] you
[1:04:19] because you see I look at it differently
[1:04:21] than you do
[1:04:29] I want to stay focused
[1:04:32] so when we talk about faith
[1:04:35] my brother and sister some
[1:04:37] are over here in the realm
[1:04:40] Satan battering them and
[1:04:43] they've been hanging out with somebody
[1:04:44] who's got a distorted view of the
[1:04:46] message or has no view of the message
[1:04:49] and they're crying out Lord Give Me
[1:04:51] Faith
[1:04:52] I want to believe Lord I want to have
[1:04:54] faith to believe this if this is the
[1:04:57] truth let's just cut it to the chase
[1:05:00] let's just bring it real simple Lord if
[1:05:02] this is truth you don't need Faith to
[1:05:05] believe this message my brother and
[1:05:06] sister you need a revelation of whether
[1:05:08] it is truth or not
[1:05:11] just cut and dried okay can we just make
[1:05:14] it cut and dry Lord I need to see is
[1:05:18] this truth or not
[1:05:20] amen now when you see its truth you will
[1:05:24] need Faith to apply it to your life but
[1:05:27] my brother and sister it doesn't take
[1:05:29] Faith to believe it takes revelation
[1:05:32] amen so it's there that we would say
[1:05:34] well I'm I'm wavering I don't know I
[1:05:37] feel pulled to this Lord help my faith
[1:05:39] no Lord come and confirm to me what is
[1:05:43] truth and then give me strength to
[1:05:46] follow the truth
[1:05:48] amen because when the word is opened to
[1:05:51] us this is a little direct I hope you
[1:05:54] don't think it's rude but my brother and
[1:05:56] sister when the word is open to us by
[1:06:01] Revelation you will look at that and
[1:06:04] contrary to everything the world
[1:06:06] believes your soul will grab a halt of
[1:06:09] that and say by Revelation this is truth
[1:06:13] period
[1:06:15] not if I feel like it's truth or not if
[1:06:18] I no it's truth
[1:06:21] amen and the word of God I'm going to
[1:06:24] read you a quote a little later but God
[1:06:26] can be blunt my brother and sister God's
[1:06:28] voice can be blunt and it's there
[1:06:30] sometimes we think well if we can change
[1:06:32] this if we can change that Brother
[1:06:34] Paul's real bad about that do you know
[1:06:36] that well if I hadn't said preach a
[1:06:38] sermon oh if I hadn't said this and if I
[1:06:40] hadn't done that now oh it would have
[1:06:41] been a better service my brother and
[1:06:43] sister brother David he's not here to
[1:06:45] defend himself but he caught up with me
[1:06:47] here recently and said brother Paul when
[1:06:49] are you going to accept the fact that
[1:06:51] what you said was what God wanted you to
[1:06:53] say and I'm like but
[1:06:57] brother and sister Faith doesn't have a
[1:06:59] butt
[1:07:00] he says this is the word this is God and
[1:07:04] I believe it and I'm holding on to that
[1:07:11] and so we certainly need that Measure of
[1:07:13] Faith because without faith my brother
[1:07:15] and sister the word tells us in my words
[1:07:18] you will accomplish nothing
[1:07:23] who wants to accomplish something
[1:07:25] in Christ of course in Christ not in our
[1:07:28] own flesh in Christ
[1:07:30] Amen brother Brown goes on and uses the
[1:07:33] term a measure of the stature of the
[1:07:36] fullness of Christ amen now that is if
[1:07:39] you've ever been in a business meeting
[1:07:41] you know maybe your Banker is showing
[1:07:42] you your cash flow for the year he's got
[1:07:45] a graph right there and he's like now
[1:07:47] here your cash flow is doing real great
[1:07:49] we got right here in the summer doldrums
[1:07:51] and you had almost no cash flow and uh
[1:07:54] then you this and then you that and you
[1:07:57] can follow this this graph this deal uh
[1:08:00] you know a heart monitor is really a
[1:08:02] graph is what it is it's telling you
[1:08:04] what's happening at the moment
[1:08:06] amen and sometimes that when it gets to
[1:08:09] be a flat line tells you the moment's
[1:08:11] not good
[1:08:13] and so we'll look at this when we have
[1:08:16] this measure of the stature of the
[1:08:19] fullness of Christ now just bear with me
[1:08:22] a little bit I can't explain it all in
[1:08:24] this service and keep it in a reasonable
[1:08:25] time but now we're looking at the graph
[1:08:29] of where we fit in the stature
[1:08:37] I I want to know that
[1:08:40] I want to know
[1:08:42] if I am not matching up
[1:08:46] to the stature of the fullness of Christ
[1:08:50] then I say Lord help me help you
[1:08:53] let the word come let us speak to me I
[1:08:55] Lord even if it scrapes the hide off me
[1:08:58] I need to know where I stand because I
[1:09:01] want to hear those words well done my
[1:09:04] good and faithful servant I don't want
[1:09:05] to go to church for 40 years to hear
[1:09:08] this and say well you have fallen short
[1:09:14] amen so Lord give us a graph let it be
[1:09:17] clear to me
[1:09:19] oh give me the word
[1:09:22] amen not watered down doesn't have to be
[1:09:25] profound
[1:09:27] now there's nothing wrong don't discard
[1:09:28] these brothers that are very profound
[1:09:30] speakers amen that just really rivet you
[1:09:32] my don't discard that my brother and
[1:09:34] sister but don't make that or
[1:09:36] prerequisite whether you're going to
[1:09:38] apply it to your life or not well you
[1:09:40] know it just doesn't move me like this
[1:09:41] brother does well if it was a word it
[1:09:44] better be moving you amen
[1:09:46] Hallelujah and then he says the measure
[1:09:50] of manifestation
[1:09:53] my brother and sister we look at this
[1:09:55] and sometimes we if we're not careful
[1:09:59] we will look and say well praise God
[1:10:02] look at this Revelation in the message
[1:10:03] look at this Revelation look at this
[1:10:05] scripture look at this look at this is
[1:10:06] this but my brother and sister this same
[1:10:09] graph that we were talking about might
[1:10:11] have another flip side to it that might
[1:10:14] actually show is this word that we say
[1:10:17] Amen to
[1:10:19] moving my heart monitor
[1:10:21] because if the word we're saying Amen to
[1:10:24] doesn't move the monitor amen doesn't
[1:10:27] change the graph at all amen then we've
[1:10:31] got a serious problem I think they call
[1:10:33] it a flat line
[1:10:34] and there's no recovery from Flatline
[1:10:38] unless
[1:10:40] somebody's got the courage
[1:10:42] hand me the paddles
[1:10:45] reminds me of a story true story in an
[1:10:48] airport
[1:10:49] man has a heart attack
[1:10:51] falls down literally right in front of
[1:10:55] one of those defibrillator things that's
[1:10:56] in the wall
[1:10:58] and this guy had watched enough now get
[1:11:00] this this true story the guy had watched
[1:11:03] enough medical TV
[1:11:06] foreign
[1:11:07] to know that you take those things and
[1:11:09] you put them on the person and you do
[1:11:11] you know you shock them and people are
[1:11:14] all like oh call security call this call
[1:11:17] that and he's like nothing bust the door
[1:11:19] open grab that thing everybody stand
[1:11:21] back bam nothing happened bam nothing
[1:11:25] happened bam enough nope there's a
[1:11:28] twitch
[1:11:30] later in the hospital the doctors are
[1:11:33] like sir
[1:11:35] if you hadn't persisted
[1:11:38] it was that last time that brought him
[1:11:41] back to life and I'm telling you Saints
[1:11:43] God is here to shock you if that's what
[1:11:46] it takes to put life back in you and it
[1:11:50] might be a shock in finance it might be
[1:11:52] a shocking relationship it might be a
[1:11:55] shock in your health or a health of
[1:11:57] someone around you it might be a shock
[1:11:59] in the church but God's willing to shock
[1:12:01] you as many times as it takes to put
[1:12:03] life back into you
[1:12:06] amazing
[1:12:07] then the man
[1:12:10] had to admit to the doctor all he knew
[1:12:12] about such things as what he had watched
[1:12:14] on television
[1:12:16] I'm sure sister April will agree with
[1:12:19] this the doctor's like
[1:12:21] oh no
[1:12:23] but it worked
[1:12:27] God God might use the song leader might
[1:12:29] use the prayer over the prayer requests
[1:12:31] he might use a visiting preacher he
[1:12:33] might use whoever
[1:12:36] sometimes
[1:12:37] it's not about even exactly what was
[1:12:39] said
[1:12:41] but the shock
[1:12:46] so God says you know what I want to do
[1:12:48] I want to see
[1:12:50] a measure of manifestation of the word I
[1:12:52] give you here's your portion of the word
[1:12:54] I want to see a result from it I want to
[1:12:57] see it change your life I want to see
[1:12:59] you find it King David mentioned to the
[1:13:02] the young adults that you know sometimes
[1:13:05] God works in different ways and God
[1:13:07] started with King David started with
[1:13:09] David when nobody even dreamed he'd be a
[1:13:11] king and here's David and God's working
[1:13:13] with him David didn't walk out and say
[1:13:15] well praise God I'm gonna I'm gonna kill
[1:13:18] Goliath I'm gonna do this word no what
[1:13:20] did he do God God started meeting him
[1:13:22] and lose God started touching him here
[1:13:25] touching him here answering a prayer
[1:13:27] here something happening here and he's
[1:13:29] got a bear and he's got a lion and when
[1:13:31] he gets there to Goliath it's not about
[1:13:34] will you know I don't know I can just
[1:13:37] know he was there looking this is what
[1:13:40] my God can do anything
[1:13:44] he didn't put a limitation on God
[1:13:47] well you know glass way bigger than a
[1:13:49] bear he's way bigger than a lion I don't
[1:13:51] know about this no what God had placed
[1:13:54] in that heart and that Faith to know
[1:13:57] that God is God and I trust him and my
[1:14:01] brother and sister that's one of the
[1:14:02] issues that's wavering in the message
[1:14:04] today is the devil has slipped in enough
[1:14:06] and there's been enough disappointments
[1:14:08] of life that people are coming and they
[1:14:11] say I trust God but they don't
[1:14:15] I lift my hand I have the season I've
[1:14:17] had the time I've had the circumstance
[1:14:19] that I say oh lord your will is perfect
[1:14:22] while I'm trying to fix it
[1:14:25] and what God wanted us to do is sit back
[1:14:27] and say Lord I I I'll give you I'll give
[1:14:31] you the whole situation now I know this
[1:14:33] is just a crazy way to put it but you
[1:14:35] know there was some singer singer song
[1:14:37] Lord take the wheel they got their foot
[1:14:39] on the break the clutch the gas pedal
[1:14:41] Lord you can have the wheel my brother
[1:14:43] and sister God wants a complete
[1:14:45] surrender Amen in fact you might as well
[1:14:48] just go ahead and climb in the backseat
[1:14:51] and let him take control
[1:14:54] because if we don't there won't be any
[1:14:56] manifestation
[1:14:57] or
[1:14:59] as the Old Testament says
[1:15:02] God in those times
[1:15:04] made it such paraphrasing
[1:15:07] that there was no way Israel could say
[1:15:10] we did this
[1:15:16] maybe we need a 21st century
[1:15:19] event like that
[1:15:22] but wouldn't that be a shock
[1:15:25] that God would put us in such a position
[1:15:28] that we possib not possible for us
[1:15:32] impossible for us
[1:15:36] but God's still God
[1:15:39] and he's still got a people that trust
[1:15:41] him
[1:15:45] isn't an interesting Saints how God
[1:15:46] tests us with time
[1:15:50] recently had a little interaction in a
[1:15:52] conversation
[1:15:55] you wonder how people could sit
[1:15:58] they could be the house of God for 40
[1:16:00] years
[1:16:02] and as it would be year 41.
[1:16:05] they wake up one day and say this is
[1:16:07] this is all false
[1:16:08] I've been in a cult for 40 years
[1:16:13] sounds shocking doesn't it
[1:16:16] now if they really are in a cult
[1:16:20] is it okay to speak straight
[1:16:22] if they really are in a cult
[1:16:26] they must not have been checking out the
[1:16:28] word of God
[1:16:29] in the last 40 years
[1:16:35] and if they've been checking out the
[1:16:37] word of God for the last 40 years
[1:16:40] they would know right where they stand
[1:16:45] not a shock out of the dark you mean
[1:16:48] I've been in a cult for 40 years
[1:16:51] and I didn't even know it
[1:16:53] oh all it tells me is you haven't been
[1:16:55] in your Bible
[1:16:57] but it also tells me if they had been in
[1:16:59] their Bible they would stand up and say
[1:17:01] revelation of Jesus Christ will stand
[1:17:04] the test of time
[1:17:06] it will no longer be my Revelation it
[1:17:08] will no longer be what I know what I can
[1:17:10] do what I see what I understand it's
[1:17:13] back to the word and the word will stand
[1:17:17] the test of time
[1:17:20] and so as we see this test of time
[1:17:22] coming my brother and sister what will
[1:17:25] happen is we will either go stronger
[1:17:27] with time or we will grow weaker with
[1:17:29] time and you'll see the very nature of
[1:17:32] the Bride of Jesus Christ the manifested
[1:17:34] word is not getting weaker my brother
[1:17:37] and sister we are seeing a bride who's
[1:17:39] recognizing who she is and as she comes
[1:17:43] and takes a halts of the word she's
[1:17:45] finding that the word is being
[1:17:47] manifested and we don't have to go look
[1:17:49] to Africa or Europe or somewhere else we
[1:17:53] can look right in the mirror of our own
[1:17:55] house and see that the word is coming
[1:17:59] stronger and stronger and stronger and
[1:18:03] the battle and the victory in the Old
[1:18:05] Testament it says and the victory is
[1:18:08] mine amen I can look in the mirror and
[1:18:11] say this victory of the word is mine
[1:18:15] amen I don't have to ask permission to
[1:18:17] be victorious I don't have to beg the
[1:18:20] devil to let me be victorious I can look
[1:18:23] at the word and the word speaks back to
[1:18:26] me and says you are victorious and I'm
[1:18:30] on this side as it were the mirror of
[1:18:32] the word saying I am victorious
[1:18:36] amen
[1:18:37] Hallelujah
[1:18:39] see my brother and sister
[1:18:42] we're not here to grow weaker and weaker
[1:18:45] and weaker and we're there Lord let the
[1:18:49] Rapture take place quickly Lord because
[1:18:53] I'm getting weaker no sir my brother and
[1:18:56] sister this word manifested the power
[1:19:00] coming from this we were Hallelujah the
[1:19:03] line of tribe of Judah just let me lay
[1:19:05] it as this example was just a little
[1:19:07] kitten in our life at one stage there
[1:19:10] was a time that the lion of the tribe of
[1:19:13] Judah had a purr not a roar but you give
[1:19:17] that lion time and it is rising up and
[1:19:20] it's consuming amen the carcass and the
[1:19:23] lion is growing and growing and growing
[1:19:26] and then one day Satan says I think I'll
[1:19:29] go over there I think I'll bother that
[1:19:31] part of the bride of Christ and he
[1:19:33] realizes it's not a little kitten any
[1:19:35] longer it's a lion of the tribe of Judah
[1:19:39] and the word is coming forth with power
[1:19:41] in a thought Authority it's coming for
[1:19:44] changing the world around it and when
[1:19:46] this lion roars my brother and sister
[1:19:49] the rest of the world false silent
[1:19:55] oh Hallelujah
[1:20:00] we've been given a measure of time to
[1:20:02] live
[1:20:03] and I hate to admit this in public
[1:20:08] but I've sure wasted a lot of that time
[1:20:10] that God has given me
[1:20:13] but I'm not alone because the prophet of
[1:20:15] God says here I'm 50 years old and if
[1:20:17] I'm ever going to do anything for God I
[1:20:19] better get started
[1:20:20] you know he just said that for me
[1:20:22] no no you guys don't read that and claim
[1:20:24] it because I already claimed it
[1:20:27] he he said that Paul heylet down there
[1:20:29] 2023 Nampa Idaho is going to need some
[1:20:32] encouragement about this time he's
[1:20:34] wasted and so I'm going to say these
[1:20:36] words so he'll feel better about himself
[1:20:37] my brother and sister I well you know
[1:20:40] I'm telling the truth because I'm part
[1:20:41] of the Bride that's who he was speaking
[1:20:44] to
[1:20:45] um
[1:20:46] amen
[1:20:47] Hallelujah
[1:20:49] but you see my brother and sister were
[1:20:51] given a measure of time to live but it's
[1:20:53] also an appointed time
[1:20:55] you understand that a difference between
[1:20:57] the measure and being appointed and God
[1:21:00] didn't say I'm just going to measure
[1:21:01] this time out to you but when we sit
[1:21:03] down and people say I'm so thankful the
[1:21:05] message come my way you can flip through
[1:21:07] God's appointment book and there it is
[1:21:10] oh I'm so thankful God healed me go
[1:21:13] through the appointment book there it is
[1:21:16] God's given a pointed time for his word
[1:21:19] to come alive appointed time for healing
[1:21:21] virtue to flow a point of time for
[1:21:23] Revelation to come down and we need to
[1:21:26] be sitting here saying Lord I don't want
[1:21:28] to be late for my appointment I want to
[1:21:30] be on time so let me use my time wisely
[1:21:34] Hallelujah
[1:21:36] you know that come home to me the other
[1:21:38] day going to the dentist's office and
[1:21:40] coming from the house there's a route
[1:21:41] that I just drive to the dentist's
[1:21:43] office it's nice and easy and you know I
[1:21:45] get down there and the road's closed and
[1:21:46] so I drive down a mile and I'm going to
[1:21:48] go that way roads closed I drive down
[1:21:50] another mile road's closed
[1:21:52] and I'm like Mom what's wrong with these
[1:21:54] people
[1:21:56] and so then you know it's just the human
[1:21:58] nature I walk into the dentist's office
[1:22:01] and I know
[1:22:03] I know the receptionist very very well
[1:22:05] her family's a farm family that come
[1:22:07] from right out where we live and uh I
[1:22:10] walk in there and I'm like Lisa and she
[1:22:11] goes I know the roads were closed
[1:22:15] and I was like how did you know that she
[1:22:16] goes practically everybody that lives
[1:22:18] here lives out there
[1:22:20] and the roads are closed
[1:22:22] I was like good and even the dental
[1:22:25] hygienist comes in
[1:22:27] roads were closed weren't they
[1:22:30] yep okay
[1:22:32] but you see I hope you catch this
[1:22:35] even though I didn't know that was going
[1:22:37] to happen
[1:22:40] I was reactionary
[1:22:43] if I don't leave right this five ten
[1:22:45] minutes ago I'll be late
[1:22:49] so no wonder when I get to the obstacle
[1:22:53] I'm already frustrated
[1:22:55] I don't know what my it's a mess
[1:22:59] you know and then grandma
[1:23:01] I still don't think she saw me even
[1:23:04] we'll come down to this four-way at the
[1:23:07] same time
[1:23:08] I got there before she did I'm already
[1:23:10] stepping on the gas and Grandma looking
[1:23:11] straight ahead just drives out in front
[1:23:13] of me
[1:23:14] Saints we're taking communion tonight
[1:23:15] this is a confession
[1:23:18] I was like granny you need to get off
[1:23:20] the road
[1:23:23] and then I realize not only did granny I
[1:23:25] don't even see me she didn't hear me for
[1:23:27] sure
[1:23:28] so it wasn't about granny it was about
[1:23:30] me
[1:23:32] what am I doing with my time how am I
[1:23:34] managing my time how am I managing these
[1:23:36] segments of my life
[1:23:38] and so God comes and he says you know
[1:23:40] what I have an appointed time for you
[1:23:42] Paul it's called a season of restoration
[1:23:44] amen a season of repentance a season of
[1:23:48] preparation he gives us these Seasons
[1:23:51] that go with all of this that we can
[1:23:53] come and be ready for whatever comes our
[1:23:56] way can you tell me what tomorrow is
[1:23:59] we don't have a clue
[1:24:00] I was sitting there in the song service
[1:24:02] and I thought wouldn't this be just
[1:24:03] funny here it is coming up to to to uh
[1:24:07] you know preach and here we're in this
[1:24:10] communion tonight and I had just this
[1:24:12] most wicked chest pain just a few
[1:24:14] minutes ago make some of you nervous
[1:24:15] amen but I had this most wicked chest
[1:24:18] pain just just ripped through my chest
[1:24:20] and I was like great that's gonna be
[1:24:22] good I could just envision myself
[1:24:24] standing here in front of the church
[1:24:25] preaching to you and going
[1:24:27] [Music]
[1:24:28] and it's all over
[1:24:31] then my back popped him I felt better
[1:24:36] you see
[1:24:38] what if that was the appointed time
[1:24:42] I've been given plenty of preparation
[1:24:45] I've been given plenty of word to bring
[1:24:47] me to a place that instead of everybody
[1:24:50] freaking out he should have stopped and
[1:24:52] had a hallelujah praise God brother Paul
[1:24:54] beat us home
[1:24:56] but we don't operate that way
[1:25:00] but you see God wants us to be in that
[1:25:03] position
[1:25:06] Hallelujah
[1:25:08] so we have a season of preparation
[1:25:11] because the season of preparation also
[1:25:14] includes the season of restoration
[1:25:17] if we're going to be prepared to go home
[1:25:19] there has to be a restoring take place
[1:25:22] to put us that and my brother and sister
[1:25:24] that is the message of Malachi 4. Amen
[1:25:27] to restore us back to our rightful
[1:25:29] position it's not to create a new gospel
[1:25:32] from the Bible it's not to create some
[1:25:35] new Avenue or some new way but it's
[1:25:37] restoring us back to our rightful
[1:25:39] position that we can stand as men and
[1:25:42] women Sons and Daughters of God and
[1:25:45] stand in the mirror of God's word and
[1:25:47] take measure of ourself we can stand
[1:25:49] there and say Lord I want to judge
[1:25:51] myself I want to see myself in the Stark
[1:25:54] Clarity of your word
[1:25:57] so I can be prepared for that season
[1:26:00] now let's look here in the resurrection
[1:26:03] of Jairus daughter
[1:26:05] Amen brother Gideon if you'll put that
[1:26:07] up amen
[1:26:11] now we're living in the closing of this
[1:26:13] world's history the time is at hand the
[1:26:15] Gentile dispensation let me before you
[1:26:18] guys all get to reading that some of you
[1:26:19] guys are speed readers I can see it in
[1:26:21] your eyes
[1:26:22] amen I want you and realize God doesn't
[1:26:26] beat around the bush
[1:26:28] when we read this quote here I want you
[1:26:30] to just take this anchor that home God
[1:26:32] is not picking on people he's not a
[1:26:34] cruel God he's not a biased or Prejudice
[1:26:38] God
[1:26:39] he's just Direct
[1:26:42] he just says it how it's going to be
[1:26:45] the time is at hand the Gentile
[1:26:47] dispensation is winding up just like he
[1:26:49] did with the Jews he's showing a great
[1:26:51] measure of Grace to them making his last
[1:26:55] call so that the unbelievers will
[1:26:58] blaspheme the Holy Ghost and be worthy
[1:27:01] of the condemnation they're fixing to
[1:27:04] receive
[1:27:05] is that not straightforward
[1:27:07] my if we just went out in public and
[1:27:10] started saying that just like curse on
[1:27:12] curse on because you have to be what the
[1:27:17] Judgment says you are
[1:27:19] that's horrible in fact we say whoa you
[1:27:22] don't know whether that's the son or
[1:27:23] daughter of God or not
[1:27:25] so we shouldn't take that approach
[1:27:28] but look what God's doing behind the
[1:27:29] scene as it were
[1:27:31] they literally of their own free moral
[1:27:33] agency
[1:27:35] are putting themselves in a position
[1:27:36] that when judgment comes
[1:27:39] they deserve every drop of it
[1:27:43] now this is not in this quote let me
[1:27:46] just finish and then I'll expound upon
[1:27:48] that amen the condemnation they're
[1:27:50] fixing to receive but how blessed those
[1:27:53] will be that will stand out and outshine
[1:27:56] the Stars that'll believe on him and his
[1:28:00] great works of this day
[1:28:02] what is happening here my brother and
[1:28:04] sister if they are bringing themselves
[1:28:06] to be worthy of the condemnation that
[1:28:10] they are fixing to receive then let's
[1:28:12] look at what balances this and here's a
[1:28:15] bride that is going to be worthy to
[1:28:18] receive the blessing of almighty God and
[1:28:21] receive the word receive the life to
[1:28:23] receive Christ himself they're going to
[1:28:25] be worthy to receive that oh it makes my
[1:28:29] heart stirred I say thank you Lord thank
[1:28:32] you Lord and sometimes I feel weary I
[1:28:35] feel discouraged I feel like Lord what
[1:28:38] am I doing Lord I'm not good enough I
[1:28:40] can't I'm not qualified to do this but
[1:28:43] what's he doing he's making us ready to
[1:28:46] receive the accolades receive the glory
[1:28:48] receive him
[1:28:51] oh my brother and sister
[1:28:54] God this isn't arbitrarily you know if
[1:28:56] you've ever been on a Fourth of July
[1:28:59] parade or whatever you know and they
[1:29:01] have a float going down and they just
[1:29:02] throw candy
[1:29:03] they don't care where the candy goes
[1:29:06] they don't care that little kid's gonna
[1:29:08] have ten cavities when this is over
[1:29:10] we're just here throwing candy
[1:29:14] some people act like that's how God
[1:29:15] blesses people
[1:29:17] I'm sorry my brother and sister God's
[1:29:19] blessings are targeted
[1:29:21] they are pinpoint they are accurate and
[1:29:25] they are exactly what God wanted to give
[1:29:27] to you and I
[1:29:29] amen not no shotgun effect
[1:29:32] oh my brother and sister we've seen it
[1:29:34] happen in the world today that companies
[1:29:36] the minute they fired a Believer they
[1:29:39] don't find themselves rejoicing we got
[1:29:41] rid of this guy no they find themselves
[1:29:43] in financial problem what they didn't
[1:29:45] realize is they prospered because God
[1:29:47] was blessing that one man
[1:29:50] and then that one man a brother this is
[1:29:52] a true story that man went and found
[1:29:54] another job that paid even more had
[1:29:56] better consideration for a Christian
[1:29:57] boss
[1:29:59] but at the moment they said we're laying
[1:30:01] you off
[1:30:02] he didn't feel like that was a blessing
[1:30:05] he thought what did I do to deserve this
[1:30:08] it wasn't about what he did to deserve
[1:30:11] the firing
[1:30:14] it was about what he did to receive the
[1:30:18] blessing
[1:30:20] but the devil is going to put the firing
[1:30:22] you know the negative First
[1:30:25] and if we're not careful we embrace it
[1:30:28] but we've got to stop and say Lord
[1:30:29] there's a blessing hiding in here
[1:30:31] somewhere
[1:30:32] now it's really hard saints come on
[1:30:34] that's really hard
[1:30:36] amen
[1:30:38] Hallelujah we got Brothers with trucks
[1:30:41] here in the church and I can tell you I
[1:30:43] know what it's like be rolling across
[1:30:44] Wyoming and in one moment your engine
[1:30:47] purring like a kitten it was a cat and
[1:30:49] one minute it's purring like a kitten
[1:30:51] and the Nexus going
[1:30:58] what did I do deserve this Lord
[1:31:01] he's trying to take care of my family
[1:31:03] what I didn't know was God said I'm
[1:31:06] going to wean you
[1:31:08] from this
[1:31:10] and he did
[1:31:12] and I'm here today
[1:31:14] weaned
[1:31:16] from looking at the sunrise and sunset
[1:31:19] far away from home
[1:31:23] I'm weaned
[1:31:26] but you see God's call now look at this
[1:31:28] it says here that you know at the times
[1:31:30] at hand and he's winding it up and he's
[1:31:33] making a call right a great measure of
[1:31:36] his grace to them making his last call
[1:31:38] now look at this call my brother and
[1:31:40] sister it's calling out
[1:31:42] aren't you glad you heard the call
[1:31:45] amen is calling out this call has a
[1:31:48] voice
[1:31:49] now I don't have it right here in my
[1:31:51] notes but brother Brandon was preaching
[1:31:54] and
[1:31:55] he says
[1:31:57] I am God's voice
[1:32:00] to you
[1:32:03] and he says oh
[1:32:06] you didn't like that I'll say it again
[1:32:12] wow
[1:32:13] he didn't kowtow to that spirit that
[1:32:16] pushed back
[1:32:17] you know what it wasn't him
[1:32:19] it was a prophet he's standing there in
[1:32:23] an office not in his flesh in an office
[1:32:26] amen and I want you to catch that my
[1:32:29] brother and sister that we're not here
[1:32:31] in this church sitting here today in
[1:32:34] office of our flesh we are here in the
[1:32:37] office of Sons and Daughters of the
[1:32:40] almighty God and we're not sitting here
[1:32:43] in an office that we can be muffled in
[1:32:46] silence but we are sitting here as the
[1:32:48] very representation in my mole
[1:32:51] Hallelujah that when God we sing the
[1:32:54] songs we quote a quote he's in my feet
[1:32:56] he's in my hand he's in it he's walking
[1:32:59] in me he's talking in me my brother and
[1:33:01] sister realize that's your office
[1:33:04] the prophet of God wasn't William
[1:33:06] Branham preaching the gospel there's so
[1:33:09] many people they're like our Prophet
[1:33:11] William Branham that's good he is my
[1:33:14] Prophet but I got to have a revelation
[1:33:17] that he was in an office and in that
[1:33:19] office he was standing there the very
[1:33:22] voice of almighty God speaking
[1:33:25] not a man not flesh God speaking
[1:33:29] and it's not you a man or a woman
[1:33:32] standing here today it's God in you
[1:33:36] speaking because this is his office
[1:33:39] today
[1:33:41] Hallelujah
[1:33:44] not call has a voice
[1:33:48] and it was meant to be responded to
[1:33:51] amen that voice is not just meant for us
[1:33:54] now pardon me if you don't respond that
[1:33:56] way I'm not meaning anything to you but
[1:33:58] it's not for us to just say her and say
[1:34:00] no I I could see that
[1:34:04] that has some value
[1:34:07] that's that's a little marriage
[1:34:10] I'll consider that
[1:34:12] well you'll consider it right because
[1:34:14] you'll walk out of here and somebody'll
[1:34:16] ask you how your job is your car is your
[1:34:18] garden is your whatever is and you'll
[1:34:19] forget totally about these things
[1:34:21] because it takes a reaction to the
[1:34:24] calling to Anchor it in the soul
[1:34:27] amen and when you sit here and say
[1:34:30] that's the truth thank you Lord you're
[1:34:33] not talking to Paul Paul's this in an
[1:34:35] office you're talking to almighty God
[1:34:37] it's not I'm amen I don't like to amen
[1:34:40] the preacher well don't amen the
[1:34:42] preacher amen the word
[1:34:47] talk to God
[1:34:50] amen because this Hall is a call that
[1:34:52] was meant to be responded to
[1:34:55] amen nowhere in the scripture does it
[1:34:57] say mentally calculate this as being
[1:34:59] true or not
[1:35:01] Hallelujah because you see what God's
[1:35:03] doing my brother and sister
[1:35:05] he's showing his great Measure of Faith
[1:35:08] to them
[1:35:09] amen what's he doing he's meeting out
[1:35:13] he's dispensing that's what the word
[1:35:15] beats out is dispensing God is
[1:35:18] dispensing his grace to you and I
[1:35:22] through the preaching of the word
[1:35:26] well it'd be easier if we could just get
[1:35:28] up and take two in the morning with a
[1:35:30] glass of water
[1:35:32] how do you know you got faith I take it
[1:35:35] every morning at 6am
[1:35:39] of course
[1:35:41] I've digested it in six hours so by the
[1:35:44] time quitting time and rush hour traffic
[1:35:46] and home with the wife and the children
[1:35:49] my faith is completely absent
[1:35:54] seriously
[1:35:57] now God gave you this Faith it's here
[1:35:59] it's present
[1:36:00] but it needs exercised now I wished I
[1:36:03] had some kind of arm that I could put up
[1:36:05] here and show you guys you know now this
[1:36:07] is what exercise does for you but anyway
[1:36:10] uh not not my arm
[1:36:13] that I hope that maybe somewhere someone
[1:36:15] would recognize you know what Hallelujah
[1:36:17] my faith muscle
[1:36:19] my faith muscle is growing amen it's
[1:36:22] stronger than it's ever been it's not
[1:36:24] getting weaker with time my faith muscle
[1:36:26] is growing Hallelujah and we're not
[1:36:30] gonna oh pardon me this could sound
[1:36:31] strange but we're not going to stand in
[1:36:33] front of a mirror or stand in front of
[1:36:35] the rest of the body and say look at me
[1:36:39] no sir our faith muscle is there to meet
[1:36:43] every challenge of the day that God
[1:36:45] called us to he said I didn't send you
[1:36:48] in laodicea be consumed amen that Satan
[1:36:51] in the imitation of the Lion of Judah
[1:36:54] has come roaring like a lion I didn't
[1:36:57] come and call you to collapse under that
[1:37:00] I was reading a book this guy was a
[1:37:02] hunter at the turn of the century uh
[1:37:04] 19th to the 20th century and he was a
[1:37:07] hunter this actually took place in India
[1:37:08] and the man there was a man-eating Lion
[1:37:11] and the man was a professional Hunter
[1:37:13] and he comes there and and he's killed
[1:37:16] many an animal traveled all over the
[1:37:17] world and killed many a problem animal
[1:37:19] that was his specialty and one day
[1:37:22] there's this man-eating lion that's been
[1:37:24] snatching the women and the children as
[1:37:26] they would go down to the water hole
[1:37:27] it's obviously none of the men ever
[1:37:29] carried water because there was none of
[1:37:30] them at the water hole but anyway it was
[1:37:33] there that these women and these
[1:37:35] children are down at the water hole and
[1:37:37] this lion would come out ground one of
[1:37:38] them run off they were all afraid the
[1:37:40] village running out of water and when
[1:37:42] they would go down there they would have
[1:37:43] all these men surrounding a few to carry
[1:37:45] this water now amazing the men were
[1:37:47] carrying a sword weighed 7.65 pounds and
[1:37:50] the women were carrying two big jugs
[1:37:52] that weighed about 90. so you know
[1:37:54] equality
[1:37:56] but but this man goes to hunt this lion
[1:38:00] and he's only God another man with him
[1:38:05] and he said I
[1:38:07] I've hunted many an animal
[1:38:10] but I got down in the bush there in the
[1:38:13] evening time and it was so quiet
[1:38:17] and he said I walked so carefully
[1:38:22] I never
[1:38:24] heard
[1:38:25] the lion
[1:38:28] but something in me sensed it
[1:38:31] and from one step to the next
[1:38:35] I was shaking
[1:38:39] and looking around where is he
[1:38:42] that's the average Christian
[1:38:46] that's the average Christian
[1:38:48] we're terrified
[1:38:51] is that what we were called to be
[1:38:54] amen praise God I was called to be
[1:38:57] terrified and laodicea I'm fulfilling my
[1:39:00] calling
[1:39:01] no sir I was called to be an overcomer I
[1:39:03] was called to be victorious amen I was
[1:39:06] called not to be a prisoner
[1:39:10] not to be a prisoner my brother and
[1:39:13] sister to fear
[1:39:15] but to be able to stand up and say
[1:39:17] praise God I am weak Lord but Thou Art
[1:39:21] strong
[1:39:23] Hallelujah Hallelujah let me hurry along
[1:39:26] here
[1:39:27] my
[1:39:29] Hallelujah let's just go into this real
[1:39:31] quick
[1:39:33] have faith in God
[1:39:34] alongside come Pentecost and measure
[1:39:37] down the gift of the Holy Spirit
[1:39:38] speaking with tongues and signs but
[1:39:41] we're just letting a big gap through
[1:39:43] let's tonight lay the measure of God
[1:39:46] down and measure the whole word of God
[1:39:49] did you guys read between the lines
[1:39:51] there
[1:39:52] we can take speaking in tongues
[1:39:55] and all of that and call it
[1:39:57] but the prophet said lay all that down
[1:39:59] step back from that
[1:40:01] take the whole word
[1:40:04] take the whole word
[1:40:06] we're not nearly as sensational
[1:40:09] Saints I mean
[1:40:12] you guys that all laugh and I break an
[1:40:14] ankle but you know we're not here
[1:40:16] jumping off the platform bouncing off
[1:40:18] everything and screaming and hollering
[1:40:19] dancing and spinning on one toe and
[1:40:21] doing all this all that so excited
[1:40:23] people get all excited but I'll tell you
[1:40:25] what I want to do I want to walk out of
[1:40:26] here and when I hit laodicea face to
[1:40:29] face I want to be able to live it
[1:40:32] I want to walk out there and be
[1:40:33] victorious
[1:40:35] I don't want to have to go back to
[1:40:37] church to put my dancing shoes on I want
[1:40:39] to be able to live out there and walk
[1:40:41] and talk and live in the presence of
[1:40:43] almighty God day by day on trial by
[1:40:46] trial struggle by struggle and at the
[1:40:49] same time might be a weary enough old
[1:40:51] guy to not be able to hardly jump off
[1:40:53] the off the the floor and not be on I
[1:40:57] tried clicking my heels sometime back I
[1:40:58] was like oh you know click your heels
[1:41:01] anyway
[1:41:04] it takes a degree of coordination
[1:41:07] that I don't have
[1:41:12] let's let us tonight
[1:41:15] lay the measure of God down and measure
[1:41:17] the whole word of God the same holy
[1:41:19] ghost that fired the Piston back there
[1:41:21] that brought them out by faith
[1:41:23] justification the same one gave
[1:41:25] sanctification the same one gave the
[1:41:27] baptism of the Holy Ghost that same
[1:41:30] power that same Holy Ghost can move the
[1:41:33] church to Perfection we can look Mark
[1:41:36] and say praise God we used to dance in
[1:41:38] the spirit I'm not concerned about
[1:41:40] dancing in the spirit I'm concerned by
[1:41:43] looking at the word am I coming into
[1:41:45] Perfection amen I could dance dance and
[1:41:49] be lost while I'm dancing but if I'm
[1:41:52] coming into the Perfection of the word
[1:41:54] amen I might not dance but I will be
[1:41:57] perfect in Jesus Christ
[1:41:59] oh Hallelujah now I know a lot of people
[1:42:02] will tell you those two got to be
[1:42:03] connected together but at my studies of
[1:42:06] the scripture I haven't found where it
[1:42:08] says that I have to scream and shout and
[1:42:12] dance to be perfect before God
[1:42:15] but I have found the word that says my
[1:42:17] life has to match the word perfectly
[1:42:23] oh Hallelujah
[1:42:26] Hallelujah
[1:42:30] Somebody Pray I'll get motivated to move
[1:42:32] on here
[1:42:34] move the church to Perfection and it
[1:42:36] will do it to everything that God has
[1:42:38] promised in his word God will do it the
[1:42:41] trouble of it is let's cast out the
[1:42:43] world let's measure God's word
[1:42:46] and it's the truth have faith in God
[1:42:50] Jesus said for a thou shall say to this
[1:42:53] mountain be moved and don't doubt it
[1:42:55] it'll do just what you tell it to do
[1:42:57] isn't that wonderful I say that's
[1:43:01] wonderful Hallelujah let's measure up I
[1:43:04] don't care the lutherans are fine the
[1:43:06] Baptists are fine methodists are fine
[1:43:08] the Pentecostals are fine all these
[1:43:11] different things is all right but let's
[1:43:12] put it right down and say every word of
[1:43:15] God is true
[1:43:17] there's what it all comes down to
[1:43:19] everything God said is perfect
[1:43:22] and if he said whatsoever things
[1:43:25] oh
[1:43:28] oh
[1:43:29] Lord where's this Measure of Faith
[1:43:31] you're given me
[1:43:34] see God will put us to the test Saints
[1:43:38] we can say we've got Measure of Faith
[1:43:48] yeah you're right Satan
[1:43:50] I must not be a real believer because I
[1:43:53] struggle
[1:43:54] about speaking to that mountain
[1:43:59] well I mean
[1:44:01] our temper can be a mountain can't it
[1:44:06] our lack of patience or
[1:44:09] judgmental I didn't mean to say that out
[1:44:11] loud in church
[1:44:13] okay I already let it out
[1:44:16] our judgmental spirits
[1:44:19] some people's lives they're mountains
[1:44:23] some people's lives it's uh overwhelming
[1:44:28] well you know
[1:44:31] brother Alex and sister Yulia
[1:44:35] Vanessa
[1:44:37] vika sang that special
[1:44:40] but to my very well-trained musical ear
[1:44:44] did you guys notice how they started
[1:44:46] that one verse just a little slow
[1:44:52] you think I'm being ridiculous don't you
[1:44:56] but I know a brother that quoted a quote
[1:44:58] in church
[1:44:59] forgot to put a the
[1:45:01] on the very first word
[1:45:04] of the quote
[1:45:07] and the hammered for not quoting all of
[1:45:11] the quote
[1:45:14] are we raising the bride or
[1:45:17] heard of legalists
[1:45:20] come on
[1:45:22] come on well they didn't do it right
[1:45:24] well let's follow you for a while
[1:45:26] now I'm not saying that to defend
[1:45:28] anything I'm just telling you my brother
[1:45:30] and sister there comes a time that we
[1:45:32] need to have as much grace needed to
[1:45:35] them as is meeting to us
[1:45:37] and if we have had Grace meeted to us
[1:45:41] now I'm being facetious I guess I should
[1:45:43] just put that up front but could there
[1:45:45] be anyone today that would raise their
[1:45:47] hand and say never had any Grace meted
[1:45:49] to me
[1:45:50] and then come to the alternate repent
[1:45:51] for being a liar
[1:45:53] right so let's meet Grace out amen
[1:45:57] whether it's in the church or out in the
[1:45:59] world meet Grace out to them so that we
[1:46:03] can have the measure of Grace meeted
[1:46:05] back to us in our time of trouble
[1:46:09] amen amen hallelujah
[1:46:12] say to this mountain be moved and don't
[1:46:14] doubt it it'll do just what you tell it
[1:46:17] to do isn't that wonderful
[1:46:20] people say well I've spoke to the
[1:46:22] mountain I spoke to it brother I've had
[1:46:24] it and told me brother Paul I've spoke
[1:46:26] to it and nothing happened really
[1:46:28] you're a real believer you've got a
[1:46:31] prayer life you read the word of God you
[1:46:33] are consecrated you're dedicated and the
[1:46:36] devil's got you convinced it's your
[1:46:38] prayer did nothing
[1:46:40] no the devil's a liar
[1:46:43] you might not see what it did
[1:46:45] you might not see what it did for years
[1:46:49] amen
[1:46:50] look our brother Stan price shared a
[1:46:52] testimony about his daughter and
[1:46:54] condition in certain circumstance there
[1:46:56] and he said it broke him and sister
[1:46:59] merlene's hearts to basically stand on
[1:47:03] the word and tell their daughter no
[1:47:05] broke her heart
[1:47:07] and the daughter got truly upset about
[1:47:09] it she was not happy you know or
[1:47:11] Christian parents with this but later
[1:47:14] they stood on the word not on opinion
[1:47:16] not an emotion not anything they stood
[1:47:18] on the word and they said we can't do
[1:47:20] that honey it's against the word and
[1:47:22] later God comes in a supernatural way
[1:47:26] changes it all
[1:47:29] Lord help us
[1:47:31] Lord help us
[1:47:42] brother Bram says
[1:47:44] God
[1:47:47] let me lay
[1:47:49] my measuring stick
[1:47:51] down on my soul
[1:47:54] and spread it across God's word
[1:47:57] to say God it's the truth
[1:48:01] send the unction of the Holy Ghost and
[1:48:04] the Fire and Fire the cylinder above me
[1:48:07] I'll believe every word of it and you'll
[1:48:10] see things take place
[1:48:17] man
[1:48:24] I was just reading my Bible this morning
[1:48:26] Saints and I come across the scripture
[1:48:29] it was a little bit painful
[1:48:33] but I sat right there in my office in
[1:48:34] the wee hours this morning
[1:48:36] just had to take the measuring stick
[1:48:39] and lay it across me
[1:48:43] and say Lord
[1:48:44] help me
[1:48:48] help me Lord
[1:48:51] because at this moment I'm not Measuring
[1:48:54] Up
[1:48:56] and amazing the preacher is not exempt
[1:48:58] from the sermon
[1:49:01] but I tell you Lord I want
[1:49:04] I want to measure up
[1:49:06] my heart's desire is to measure up it's
[1:49:09] what I long for it's what I cry out for
[1:49:12] Lord let me measure up
[1:49:18] but you know what happens
[1:49:20] we'll measure ourselves
[1:49:23] to others
[1:49:25] well praise God I might not be what I
[1:49:27] should be but I'm doing better than he
[1:49:29] is
[1:49:33] and look at this
[1:49:35] praise God my family
[1:49:39] they're way way better
[1:49:42] off her way than this
[1:49:45] then these
[1:49:47] than them
[1:49:49] well look at the graph my family's doing
[1:49:51] better than 96.6 percent of church
[1:50:00] praise God our church doesn't have
[1:50:01] problems like their Church
[1:50:05] hmm
[1:50:09] what yardstick are we using
[1:50:12] my it's not God's yardstick
[1:50:19] but the minute Saints we take this
[1:50:21] yardstick
[1:50:23] and we start
[1:50:25] I'm trying to break my habit I honest I
[1:50:27] am about involving all of you I should
[1:50:30] just preach to you brother Stan Smith
[1:50:31] said you don't have a clock on the back
[1:50:33] of your church so that I could stare at
[1:50:37] I mean what does it stand price
[1:50:40] yeah he joked with me got no clock for
[1:50:42] me to stare at in the back of the church
[1:50:44] so I had to stare at the doorknob
[1:50:48] well I don't do very good at storing
[1:50:49] door knobs I want to stare at you
[1:50:54] but you know what happens
[1:50:55] a minute
[1:50:56] I put this yardstick on my life
[1:51:00] brother Trevor sister Carrie sister Sue
[1:51:03] Vanessa
[1:51:05] Titus
[1:51:06] all get real blurry
[1:51:09] and they just disappear out of sight
[1:51:11] because all I could see is my life
[1:51:15] at the yardstick
[1:51:19] and you know I will come back to judging
[1:51:21] you guys just as soon as I get every
[1:51:23] moat out of my eye
[1:51:26] hopefully that's before the rapture
[1:51:30] otherwise I'll need a huge measure of
[1:51:32] Grace
[1:51:34] it will be God is good
[1:51:36] how do we measure up do we come up short
[1:51:39] well it almost rhymed this morning it

[1:52:03] forgetting those things which are behind
[1:52:05] me that are baggage that are holding me
[1:52:07] back and I am reaching forth into those
[1:52:10] things which are before me and it's
[1:52:12] because of that Revelation I can press
[1:52:15] to the mark of the prize of the high
[1:52:17] calling in God in Christ Jesus

[1:52:24] be perfect
[1:52:26] what
[1:52:27] we've got all this baggage we've got all
[1:52:29] these things we're distracted by and
[1:52:31] then he turns right around from one
[1:52:33] verse or a couple verses comes right
[1:52:35] back those of us that are perfect
[1:52:37] you see one he can deal with the flesh
[1:52:39] that we got to keep pressing on you're
[1:52:41] looking at this get rid of the baggage
[1:52:43] then he's telling you you're perfect

[1:52:49] otherwise minded God shall reveal this
[1:52:52] even unto you what's he doing coming
[1:52:54] right down our prayer life in our days
[1:52:57] that we're reading the Bible hearing the
[1:52:59] prophet listening to music maybe
[1:53:01] preaching of the word and God reminds
[1:53:04] you of what you did that you need to
[1:53:06] correct

[1:53:20] that it totally fits in but I think it
[1:53:22] does so hopefully you agree
[1:53:25] any man that's ever had any made any
[1:53:28] showing at all in this life
[1:53:31] has been man who has trusted God
[1:53:34] and took him at his word right
[1:53:37] man that doesn't take him at his word
[1:53:40] never amounts to a hill of beans
[1:53:43] we've had a George Washington and
[1:53:45] Abraham Lincoln whatever more but the
[1:53:47] greatest men that the world has ever had
[1:53:49] has been those who put their simple
[1:53:53] faith
[1:53:55] in God
[1:53:56] Hallelujah
[1:53:58] simple faith
[1:54:00] why didn't the prophet of God say all of
[1:54:03] those that explained the seals
[1:54:07] those that can explain the Thunders and
[1:54:10] the vials
[1:54:11] and how they all connect together
[1:54:15] he said those who put their simple
[1:54:18] faith sister vika if you'll come
[1:54:22] my brother and sister
[1:54:24] this
[1:54:25] is the measure
