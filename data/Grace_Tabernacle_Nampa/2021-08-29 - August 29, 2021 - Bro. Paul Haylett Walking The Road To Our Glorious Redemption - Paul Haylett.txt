the service to brother paul as he comes to sing 888 aren't you glad you're tuned in for a different sound amen [Music] we hear about the wars see famine in the land there's questions in the children's eyes trouble in the east again the whole world is shaking there's no sure place to stand and mournful sounds are heard throughout the land but i keep listening for a different sound the sound of the city that trunks are coming down the sound of the bride being united with the groove i keep listening i keep listening i keep listening for a different sound i remember the preacher saying son it shall come to pass there will come a generation that will be the last i can't believe i'm standing here seeing the end of time and the preacher's voice he's echoing in my mind but i keep listening for a different sound the sound of the city that jumps are coming down the sound of the bride being united with the groove the sound of the chorus singing glory to the lamb well i keep listening yes i keep listening i keep listening for a different sound scene again oh but i keep listening for a different sound the sound of the city that john saw coming down the sound of the bride [Music] singing glory the lamb will i keep listening it's i keep listening i keep listening [Music] hallelujah aren't you glad that your ears have been tuned to catch a different sound amen you know we look in the world around us my brother and sister and oftentimes i've mentioned how satan loves to use distractions just look there's as much chaos on the earth right now to catch our attention as there has ever been in history everything happening amen but the bride is listening for a different sound hallelujah the stirring the moving of the holy spirit is in her midst it's not a voice that's going to come on cnn or fox or something like that it's a voice that's coming right here amen and have you ever experienced this where you almost felt like you heard it here but the real reality of it saints was you were hearing it here right but because of the human element and the way we relate to sound and hearing and learning and all this thing we're convinced it's like did a voice just speak to me yes it did but it wasn't speaking here it was speaking here and it echoed through the very fiber of your being and you knew it was the lord you know it was god speaking to you god bless you this morning so happy to be here i just want to just remind all of you uh that communion will be next saturday evening september the fourth at six pm so let's just uh let's remember that and uh encourage all of you and while today i realized some of my notes come back and tie into communion but you know it's interesting because i had kind of forgotten the communions this coming saturday and just as we dig into these things and with the lord speaking to us then i realized oh how beautifully how well this ties together and god is great amen let's always remember our brother prashant and sister koncha in a world of identifying i hope you can see a tad bit of humor in this and world uh identifying they identify as being here and so let's not forget them amen just as we could envision they were sitting on a pew here uh they our brother our sister very dear we love them so much i just pray the lord will open the door but we have to always as as the word of god tells us shows us uh we must close everything out with lord thy will be done lord willing amen let's just stand today and want to speak to you on um i i didn't know that sister jerry was even singing a song and the song fit and brother jason's last song here just struck my heart walking the road to our glorious redemption amen and just to make sure that you understand sister jerry didn't know i was preaching on this topic so the revelation of the song she chose was her revelation and uh so we're just turning our bibles to the book of luke uh and uh here we want to just visit the uh scriptures concerning uh cleopas and his friend walking on the road to emmaus and to lord willing bring that back into our day to realize this is happening once again and the power of god amen is that eternal circle uh god said i am god and i change not and i'm happy because when he said i was saved amen i don't ever have to stop and question that again i don't have to say well i made a mistake i did something here or there did god change his mind nope his thoughts are eternal amen and he said i redeemed you i sprinkled my blood uh over you and not only that because between the ark and you would be judgment and so therefore i will cover the mercy seat with my blood and i will cover the ark with my blood that judgment cannot come and that beautiful i just reading it this morning early this morning amen the brother branham putting it this way he said the believer will never come to judgment because she's already been judged and i'm glad today that the lord judged us worthy to receive his word worthy to receive the life amen that we're not here as it were vying to do great deeds so we might find ourselves acceptable but we find ourselves accepted in the beloved because the beloved claimed us and that is so beautiful luke 24 starting with the 13th verse amen and behold two of them went that same day to a village called emmaus which was from jerusalem about three score furlongs and they talked together of all these things which had happened and it came to pass that while they communed not a casual conversation can you believe what the president just did can you believe what's happened here can you believe but they were actually in communion so while they didn't realize the very atmosphere that was around them was setting them up for this incredible you might say event whatever words you understand what i'm saying the atmosphere that was already around them they didn't say come in the presence of jesus and go oh wait we need to change our atmosphere they were walking they were living they were communing in an atmosphere that jesus christ said i'll come down in their midst isn't that beautiful just stirs my heart lord help us to create atmospheres amen hallelujah and they talked together of all the things which had happened and it came to pass that while they communed together and reasoned jesus himself drew near and went with them but their eyes were holden that they should not know him and he said unto them what manner of communications are these that ye have one to another as ye walk and are sat and the one of them whose name was gleopas answered and said unto him art thou only a stranger in jerusalem and hast not known the things which are come to pass therein these days and he said unto them what things you notice he doesn't affirm or deny he just asked them i want to hear it from your lips i want to hear your testimony what things and they said unto him concerning jesus of nazareth which was a prophet mighty indeed and word before god and all the people and how the chief priests and our rulers delivered him to be condemned to death and have crucified him but we trusted that it had been he which should have redeemed israel and beside all this today is the third day since these things were done yey and certain women also of our company made us astonished which were early at the sepulcher and when they found not his body they come saying that they have also seen a vision of angels which said that he was alive and certain of them which were with us went to the sepulcher and found it even so as the women had said but him they saw not then he said in them oh fools wonder how we have the message would receive jesus christ in our midst today o fools and soul of heart to believe all that the prophets have spoken ought not christ to have suffered these things and to enter into his glory and beginning at moses and all the prophets he expounded unto them in all the scripture the things concerning himself and they drew nyan to the village whether they went and he made as though now i want you to catch these words he made as though he would have gone further but they constrained him saying abide with us for it is toward evening and the day is for spent and he went in to tarry with them and it came to pass as he said it meet with them he took bread and blessed it and break and gave to them and their eyes were opened and they knew him and he vanished out of their sight and they said one to another did our heart not burn within us while he talked with us by the way and while he opened to us the scriptures heavenly father we just ask you lord open the scripture to us today father lord there's so many thoughts so great upon our heart as we look at the condition of the world and truly father we see this scripture fulfilled and lord yet we must also take the thought lord that it could be today tomorrow next week next month next year in one place lord the prophet said it might even be a hundred but one thing we know father we are walking in the way and you are walking with us father that's all that matters lord is that you are walking with us we ask you lord to lead us and guide us today be with those that are not here father those that are gone lord just father every brother and sister father that you would just come and encourage hearts and strengthen we thank you father for the opportunity to serve you today lord to walk in your glorious light and walk in the very privilege of sons and daughters of god we thank you now in your name amen you may be seated saints i won't bother to explain to you how that the mercy seat has led us to this place but i will make this statement that any time that the word of god is opened or revealed to you and i that is god's mercy it would not ever be an intellectual ability it would never be something we could find or figure out but it's god's mercy as he opens his word to us and makes it alive and you know we look at this and see cleopas and this unnamed brother and how that um they were coming along and they were recounting and speaking to one another no doubt my brother and sister they were saying you know as the scripture says we we thought that this jesus of nazareth was going to come and rise up you see my brother and sister it was no different in that day than it is in this day there were many doctrines about the coming of jesus christ there was many ideas and ideologies and little groups and issues and schisms and some say he's going to come here and some this and and we'll find that it is there that many thought in that day that he was actually going to come as the mighty conqueror and that meaning that he was going to rally great armies and deliver israel from their oppressors but my brother and sister he came as a mighty conqueror standing right in their midst and he delivered amen he uh broke the bondage of the bond of the mighty oppressor but the people because they were not looking correctly they they missed it entirely and we even see cleopas and his friend walking down the road to emmaus discussing these things and we'll see that it is actually god's great mercy that come down and chose to speak to them because you see they had this idea that he was going to be that mighty deliverer just like many others did and they had missed the real true revelation of what had happened in their day and as they reasoned together we see in verse 16 it says that their eyes were blinded their eyes were holded that they they simply had a man you know we can envision that they're walking along and a man just seems to come out of nowhere kind of drift right in and to the conversation walking with them and and he's listening and then he starts to communicate with them and so we see uh this in verse 17 uh that uh jesus even comments on the fact that they are sad and so they are there you know my brother and sister you realize now we all are human and we have our different things that we we struggle with but being the bride of jesus christ with the revealed word in our day we should be able to stop and say lord break a spirit that might be upon me lord the spirit of depression a spirit of of whatever that might be holding you back because you see my brother and sister the greatest thing that could ever happen on earth has happened you say well we we haven't went in a rapture yet my brother and sister the rapture is nothing more than another portion of the unfolding of a word of god that was spoken it has to come to pass it will come to pass and so therefore don't get all fretted up about uh uh you know what is happening when is it going to happen you know it's like oh my you know this i'll give you something to fret about did you know that if you go spend the time waste the time in a way i'd say it this way and look through the hierarchy of our american government and you will find that almost everybody in a high position has went and kissed the pope's ring that should be confidence inspiring but it's prophecy it's the word coming to pass so you see my brother and sister that that uh the majority of our high courts are catholic majority of our high authorities ambassadors etc etc are catholic look what's coming to pass everybody's worried about what is china going to do i don't care what china is going to do they're going to keep producing cheap plastic whatever there's no prophecy of china taking over so we see how this is and they're sad they just had the greatest message preached to them in their midst they're walking down the road but i want you to understand you see my brother and sister it's there because they had a certain mindset they had a certain uh thought process that was determining in their mind how that uh the redeemer the messiah was going to come and what was going to happen and they were looking around expecting to see a certain result and when they didn't see that they they knew my brother and sister down in their heart that he was the messiah but they could not reconcile what was happening around them and i have to admit there's times that it's hard to reconcile what is happening around us we have men that carry the message for so long so stalwart and they're laying it down and turning and walking away that is mind-boggling to me but you see my brother and sister we can type this into into the scriptures joshua et cetera but you look at this so there's things that are taking place that that just baffle us and and it's there but that doesn't take away from the promise that was given and so as they're walking because they do not realize they're walking in the presence of jesus christ they are there and this man seems to have said the right words and approach them in the right fashion and so they start to pour their hearts out and they start to tell them uh tell him all of the reasons why that they are discouraged why they're walking sad down the road to emmaus he was crucified and now the tomb is empty and we don't really have answers but you see if you go back in the word he documented everything that he was going to do but because we have a preconceived notion of even what the word means we miss it but you know what they were doing they might have been discouraged they might have been a little confused but they were testifying of jesus christ they weren't walking along talking about what president biden is doing and what's happening here and what's happening there they were focused on jesus christ and even in our times that we don't understand when our thoughts are on him and our heart is upon him his word says he's present with us and so they are there discouraged and they're testifying of jesus christ but they go on to stay to state or to say what they thought from their perspective certain that he was the one going to come as a mighty general going to come and rally israel together and rise up once again as they had all through the ages and and defeat their conquerors but you see god had another path he was moving it from as it were a nation warring against a nation to a people warring against a spirit or a realm that was there moving it from something here a natural kingdom into a spiritual kingdom coming into a transition of time that he says i'm not going to empower great armies to overcome i'm going to empower you the army of god sons and daughters of god i'm going to empower you to be the overcomer you are now going to be able to stand up and claim the position i am a conqueror amen i have i am not afraid of death i'm not afraid of hell not afraid of the grave and while we don't say mocking words about satan because the word tells us not to my brother and sister we should be coming to a place that we recognize the word says in my deepest hour my darkest hour i can call on the lord and he will come and he is the mighty conqueror and we can stand upon that amen no longer a time that we have to rally and as i've said in this church and i'll say it again as a reminder it doesn't have to be a mother with a baby a sick baby or hurt baby or whatever it might be a mother trying to frantically dial someone else that they might pray for the child but they recognizing who they are in jesus christ can lay their hands upon the child upon the husband upon the neighbor whatever it is and pray the prayer of faith and god will honor that amen it's time for us to recognize who we are amen so they're telling them of the one that they had sought for he's telling the one that they sought for the one they were looking to and they don't seem to really realize they're just talking about things that they thought should come to pass but never did does that kind of remind us sometimes of some people maybe people that look like us maybe people that are us that we sometimes say well i prayed and i expected god to do this and i expected god to answer my prayer like this and people get disappointed people even get so far that they get angry with god or the lack of his concern for the prayer that they pray not realizing as the scripture says their prayer is actually a prayer that is amiss they're missing the mark with their prayer they're not seeing the picture but they expect god to answer it in that fashion so they were stating what they thought what they saw from their perspective and i i think that's good my brother and sister god's not going to chastise you as it were just because your perspective is off but uh well we'll touch on that in a minute amen so they were certain as i said that he was the one to redeem israel so they're telling the one that they were that they sought for about the things that seemed to be but never happened of uncertainty and of unmet expectations can we be honest this morning and lift a hand and say i have unmet expectations in my life i have things i thought were going to happen a certain way of things i thought i might accomplish in life you know it's kind of scary when you're my age and you read research and they talk about you know that you know i forget the numbers forgive me if i'm got them skewered but it's 67 percent or 77 percent of adults never achieve the goals they set in their teen years there's a lot of unmet expectations out there so the uncertainty and the unmet expectations now come pouring out of them but you know what i have to say i love this i i've i've been in this position i'm sorry to say i've been in this position and and i can from my own heart say i've been there but you know what jesus didn't come along and say oh i'm so sorry to hear this i'm sorry that your expectations were not met what does he do he says o fools and slow of heart to believe thank you brother trevor i i was pausing for emphasis and i got it amen that's just fine that's just fine brother trevor all that the prophet said see not our favorite quotes my brother and sister not the ones that kind of put me in a superior position to you or vice versa or the one that makes them look in a bad light and me in a good light know all that the prophet said come on we apply that in this age it would change them if people could truly apply it it would change the mentality of a lot of people if they could apply that because they're like well the reason we this is because of this and the reason that was of this and this is that and that is this and that's why i stand on my position i have quotes sorry i've got another 101 quotes that kind of counter your quote because you somehow got yours out of context never let this message become a battle of quotes saints the prophet of god told us what we should be doing is praying for revelation let's let these quotes be the foundational building stones of a complete revelation of what god sent a prophet for not to be a contest of i do this and i do that and we do this and we worship this way my brother and sister that's not what it was there for that is a contrarian devil spirit coming in to create warfare in the body of christ amen to be that we wouldn't darken the door of that church because of this wouldn't do this because of that now my brother and sister i will clarify this i will as a pastor as long as god and you allow me to be the pastor of this church we're not going to sit here and let someone preach some warped doctrine of the message of the bible just because we need to be kind and loving sorry it don't work that way amen we're going to let them know you're wrong and if you care to here is the ream of information that you can see where it is some people think well if you really love them you would just let them where i read this was supposedly a old russian story so if it's not a russian story forgive me for blaming it on the russians was that a smirk sister vika it was but the russian story is is the boy is in the snow and one day finds a little wolf puppy and it's so cute and he takes it home and begs his parents let me keep it let me keep it and the parents relented and the little wolf puppy was growing and growing and growing and one day the parents come home and there's a very contented wolf laying there and no child that's what false doctrine evil spirits that's what they do they rest until the day comes that they realize i can devour i can do this that's why we as ministers that's why we're not called to compromise saints we have to stand solid on these things and sometimes you don't seem very loving when you're standing solid i mean it'd be hard to say that david looked loving when he chopped goliath's head off but it was necessary so they're they're pouring out all these things and jesus doesn't give them oh i'm so sorry but you see the word always corrects the air let's never ever forget that saints when god is dealing with you never forget that the word will correct the air and if god loves you he will correct you so you know if life is just such peaches and cream as it were my brother and sister you know you might want to stop and just kind of question because we're soldiers we're in a great fight we're we're not here just to enjoy a time and and just to cruise along in verse 25 he said i'm the old fools and slow of heart to believe all that the prophets have spoken and my brother and sister i i think this day and age that strong of talk would be enough to cause many people to be offended and walk away if jesus was standing right here in our midst and we we didn't recognize it was jesus right at this point they don't know this is jesus christ it's just a man standing there and he's telling them oh fools and soul of heart to believe many people would be like i don't have to take that from you oh can we say thank you lord for the anointing to accept the word amen as hard as it is to be able to accept the correction of the word my brother and sister that's because god is rich in mercy amen amen i say this morning i say this with all my heart lord anoint us with a spirit to receive correction let us never buck up against this you know we see this i'll just throw this in as a little additional counterpart i won't name names dates places whatever but my brother and sister when you see people that push up against something that is preached until it's confirmed that brother branham said it so one minute they're pushing back with all their strength i can't accept that well brother branham said it oh praise god see something's wrong because the nature in them the spirit in them is then being as it were respecter of person because brother branham said it now now i will agree with it but what about the nature or the spirit that's in us to be the nature of christ and i will share a quote here after a while you can't you can't fight against this the nature of god that's in you cannot fight against the word of god until oh i realized that it was no see something's wrong we need to recognize that the spirit of christ now that doesn't say that you wouldn't go well i don't know about that then the holy spirit deals with you and you say lord forgive me but i'm talking about wholesale pull the sword raise the shield i disagree with you see there's a spirit that's there because you see he's kind of telling them that you believe the prophets you've read what they spoke you've heard what they spoke but they couldn't receive all of it now we'll look at this he says you know ought not christ he's laying this out to have suffered these things to enter into his glory is this not the word that's what he's telling them saints i don't mean to interpret the scripture but he's saying is this not the word that this is what was happened this was prophesied by isaiah by zachariah these things were all laid out here was all presented before you that says this must come and it must be as it were we preached on that about the the testator and and the testimony all of this must come he must die for this to go into effect because if there's no death then there's no will to be tested nothing to be fulfilled and he lays this all out in the word and he's laying it out to these men and because they were godly men they were men that god had had desire to reveal this you know he come and he he's expounded unto them the scripture and the things concerning himself and i say my brother and sister we need to hear those words again we actually need as believers of a message we need to actually come to the place that the word would be strong enough to look us in the face and say oh fools and slow of heart let's get over all of the pettiness of this message and all of the politics of this message and all of that we lift up this man and put that man down we bring this one in fellowship and that one out of fellowship and we have our group and they're not part of our group and we this and we that how about we get back to what the prophet said how about we get back into the word of god and let the word become a living testament in our life again instead of a political instrument you see this whole journey and i'll cut through this you know this scripture certainly can read and study it you see acting as though he would go on he's walked with them they still see him as just a man that they are probably no doubt marveling look at what he's doing he's talking about the messiah he's talking about uh this man jesus of nazareth and he's sharing to us the scripture and how that the reasons this must be is here and here and testified here and prophesied here and they're there and their memory see this is why it's important that our pure minds be stirred up he wasn't preaching them something new he wasn't having to prove to them moses said this they knew he didn't have to prove to them that these was the prophecies of scripture on days gone by they knew but he was stirring up their pure mind and as it was being stirred up they were starting to say oh i see i see i don't know why i never saw that this was connected to this and these must come to pass before this can happen and oh it's not about a military might it's about a power of god in our midst and they started to respond to this they were they were thinking oh yes this is so good and you see what it is is he starts as they're coming and he acts as though he is going to go on you know my brother and sister you can look in the word especially take what the prophet of god said he never intended to go on he was just presenting them with the opportunity let me put it like this he gave them the opportunity to invite him to sup with him in other words god coming down sometimes stirring you and i to give us an opportunity to come and enter into worship to enter into prayer to pour our heart out to him he creates an atmosphere that makes us want to he gives them the opportunity invite to sup with them now let's look at this when their eyes were open they knew him notice they invited him in now they couldn't explain it they it's just he just they didn't understand what he was talking about it was all mixed up to them they couldn't understand it but yet they they said invite constrained him you must come in he said no i got to be going on oh the lord you must come in you must come in and constrained him until he called upon him until he had to go in that's the way you do and when he gets inside that's when he can reveal himself and can make himself known when inside you see if they have just come to the place my brother and sister i hope you see the big picture if they had just walked with him and they come and they said we're going to spend the evening here and he said i'm going to go on and they just said well it was nice visiting with you they would have never had the face-to-face encounter with jesus christ they would have never had that experience but there was something within their hearts an atmosphere that was there with them even before jesus started walking in their presence that they were there speaking it was the topic of their mind was they confused brother brown was talking about they didn't how to explain this they didn't know why these things were happening they thought this this and this but god had created an atmosphere a time space in eternity where he said i will come and walk with you uh cleopas and walk with you brother whatever his name was and it is it's there what was it creating a personal testimony people around they say well i i got saved in this church i was this age i was that um yeah i believe what i like to hear is the personal testimony no not the one like i was the worst drunk in town i was the worst drug addict i was the worst woman i don't like them testimonies i'm sorry to tell you because usually they prefigure anything god did with what the devil had already done but what i'm interested in is how that a man who could be angry and violent and god start to break him down and find himself sitting on a park bench in a park crying out to a god he never knew existed and him to be able to tell you that's where i met christ it was a midnight hour sitting in a public park so broken inside everything that i represented on the outside strength and virality and all of these things was all a charade because down inside i was a broken person and god come and he filled that void that's the kind of testimonies i like to hear what i pray that god allows to happen as time carries on right here amongst our young people i want to hear testimonies that the lord just allows me to grow old with you if he tarries i want to hear testimonies that when i was a young person in the world was wooing hey you young man come young woman come that heard a difference out heard the sound of a city coming down i heard a sound of the whisper of angel's wings and something embraced me and wrapped around me and held me steady hallelujah nothing better for the rebellious spirit of a teenager than a good dose of the holy ghost that'll break the rebellious spirit of the teenager every time amen so he invites him in you know and he can reveal himself once he's gone inside you see saints he never revealed himself on the road but when that atmosphere was such they said we haven't heard enough that's why it always bothers me when i hear people around the message say well you know we've been listening the message for 45 years and we've heard enough i'm sorry never never never come on something's wrong when somebody would use the words i've heard enough heartbreaking so we look at this and see now invites them to sup with them comes in there and it's when they're there that they recognize amen at what when are their eyes open saints at the breaking of the bread not sitting down in fellowship knee to knee not sitting there in that lovely presence which would have to be because there was the lamb of god in their midst but it was at the breaking of the bread i can only envision the very breaking natural of a loaf of bread and as the bread was broken they looked in revelation there wasn't lightning and thunder on the horizon there wasn't a shaking of earth but revelations swept over their minds and their heart and soul and they looked up and said this is our lord this is him and then he was gone but you see he didn't have to stay there and hold their hand any longer they were now empowered from within in the spirit to say you know what i've met him face to face he's real and the power of the word and not only that he come and revealed the word all the way through showed me who i am in jesus christ and what my purpose is here and why god put me down in the to see an age my brother and sister do you understand i forget which one of the old men of age has gone by made this statement he said uh uh something of the nature of uh we view the other ages in a different light but if we had been there as sons of god we would have walked in the light oh if i i just labored a sea is too hard for me we have electronics and we have all kinds of filth and garbage of the world and we're trying to keep our children from this and we try to do this and we're trying to do that and we live in such a horrible age and look at the condition of our nation my brother and sister if you were in the dark ages you would have been going my goodness what's happening to our country and look what's going on with the young people and look at the music that they're doing and looking at it matter what age it was but we live amen under the anointing of the holy spirit that god said the age i chose to place you in i made you capable i made you strong i made you victorious don't be looking for another age look to the promise that was given to you for this day and stand on that and say lord i'm your instrument in this day and i will fulfill the word i will bring forth what i was called to be i don't need a softer age i don't need a more this or more that i need to just know who i am and when i recognize who i am i will look at this age and say you know what satan i've overcome your music your clothes your worldliness your perversion i've overcome it by the blood of the lamb hallelujah at the breaking of the bread now let's just look real quick here in john 6 35 jesus said unto them i am the bread of life he that cometh to me shall never hunger he that believeth on me shall never thirst you see my brother and sister i i want to give you a different perspective and please don't if if i somehow don't have the right perspective on this forgive me correct me whatever but you see it wasn't the literal loaf of bread that he broke that opened their eyes it was the word that he was laying in their hearts as he is walking along the way with them it is this this tutoring as it were through the word showing them showing them it was preparing them and preparing them and when the natural event of the breaking of the bread took place it's like there it is there it is you see it wasn't literal breaking of a loaf that opened their eyes it was the word that had been being broken to them opened to them as they walked along this journey it's not just a one-day tutorial now we see this happening on the road to emmaus is is something taking place in one day but my brother and sister we're living as it is in the day by day by day by day the word being placed in us lying upon line precept upon precept the word constantly reminding us how many of you had to be reminded more than once that you as the son of god before it soaked in come on it took years of god dealing with me now maybe i'm a little slower than most of you forgive me for that but it took years and one day when the light come on at the breaking of the bread i wept did i have no more challenges no sir it seemed like there got to be more of them seemed like a whole bunch of challenges got dumped on me but one thing i recognized i know who i am now it don't matter what happens here i know who i am i want to tell you my brother and sister i don't know what the future will hold but those believers that are in afghanistan and in those parts of the world whatever might befall them they might become the martyrs of this age but i can assure you this one thing that the anointing of almighty god will fall upon them and they will know that's what they were called to they won't be begging you won't see the real believer trying to become a muslim you won't see them trying to denounce you will see them declaring if this is what god called me for i will stand up and be found testifying of jesus christ that's hard for us in the western world to fathom it's hard for us to live in our nice cushy lives oh it's so horrible i can't afford a new car my life is so bad i'm wearing the same dress shoes that i've wore for five years now come on saints there's an anointing out there that's coming down upon the people that are saying you know what i don't care take this whole world amen give me jesus give me jesus that's all that matters to me give me jesus amen and it wasn't just because they were there it wasn't just because they walked down the road to emmaus with jesus christ that this all happened my brother and sister they'd enter in to communion with him they've been communing one to another but now they entered into a communion with him and let me just throw this out that's why i believe every believer in this church should be taking communion i don't know what your reasons are i don't know why some of you don't come i don't know if it's work if it's whatever but my brother and sister you've got to understand that the commandment that god gave us the prophet reiterated is that we take communion until his coming this is not something that we just decided it's not convenient for me it ought to be something that we press into amen so they were having true fellowship with him you see christ on the inside my brother and sister is what makes a true relationship now i want to just as well just move forward right here who is your little queen in the home i like this quote i like food so when my little queen ministers food to me i'm especially happy who is the little queen in the home she ministers food to you is that right what you're late on now i don't know what that was about but when do you that's what the bride ministers to christ the word man shall not live by bread alone but by every word see she ministers the word to the king manifesting his promised word in the age that she's living in amen and i said something then you didn't get it something deeper now imagine how hard it is i know what it's like as a pastor you say things and then later you feel like i didn't say it right something how did the people not get this wasn't there a response to this brother branham is making a declaration here speaking these words and he's saying you didn't you didn't get it he recognized there was an inspiration and anointing that should have stirred rippled through the people bringing a reaction a response but you know the beautiful thing about it stirred my greater compliment that can be given by you to your lord jesus christ than for you to stand up and as it were live the word out showing him i believed you i believed you i applied your word to my life because i believed you were ministering and sometimes we don't even know that we're ministering it doesn't always have to have a title a headline a whatever sometimes look sisters i'll just put it this way men are just bears to live with aren't they sisters go ahead and lift your hands so we can see it on camera do you know you're ministering to jesus christ when you minister to your natural husband it's that simple that's the word right now if you're doing a poor job of ministering to your husband well don't feel brow beaten and don't feel judged just go pray about it let god stir your heart but when you cook for your children you clean for them you present a a presentable house for them you say well you know my husband he just doesn't do his part well don't worry about what your husband's doing do your part right natural spirit don't worry about the other just do your part do what you know you should be doing and let god take care of the rest because sometimes what we know we should be doing is we should be praying and we don't because it's a lot easier to blame the wife blame the husband blame the children blame whoever then actually do something about it now what did the prophet of god say was the greatest weapon that we have formed against the devil our prayer life now when asked are any of us really satisfied with our prayer life don't be ashamed of that just do what you should do just step up and say lord i want to before i start blaming the wife start blaming the husband start blaming the kids start blaming dad start blaming mom yeah teenagers you can have a prayer life young people you can have a prayer life you can have communion with jesus christ you don't got to be 20 years old you don't got to be married have children you don't got to have some thing you you can be 6 7 8 9 10 12 whatever 14 16 18 whatever it is and have a prayer life you can have a powerful force i feel some pushback here well here just a second we don't need an excuse we need to do what god called us to do we don't need a scapegoat we need to be acceptance of the chastisement of god in our own life and say lord it seemed like he was looking at me well if this will help defeat any spirit about he was looking at me when he said that i will just you all been looked so y'all can go home and say he was looking at me when he said that no it's the holy spirit wanting us saints to break through these barriers break through it because you see we're walking our own road to emmaus and we are walking along saying i thought it should be this and i thought it was going to be that and i thought this and i thought that but you know what the word says when we call on his name he draws nigh we draw nigh unto him he draws an eye unto us you're walking your own journey it's not emmaus it's laodicea but you can be walking with jesus christ you don't have to be we're looking back to 1965. we're looking forward to a rapture it can be right now right now hallelujah amen now look this little queen see what she's doing she was called to manifest his promised word in the age she's living we're living right now we can manifest this word right to you play once i thought it's pretty funny i never bothered i'm not too schooled on furlongs and this and that but this brother put it this way he said now with so many feet uh that they come to get to emmaus and it took him all day to get there and took him about an hour to get back you know what was it they was anointed there was no more of this wandering along scuffing the rock in the dirt i don't know what god's got for my life i don't know what god's gonna do i'm so afraid because my children and they're in public school and they have phones now and they have friends that aren't christians and i just don't know what is going to happen and um you know and we thought it should have been i mean brother branham said you know in 1204 65 he he said the lord will just be coming any day now how is it we're in 2021 i i just don't understand when god comes down and says you know what i gave you your children i gave a promised word i filled them with the holy ghost i wrote their name in the lamb's book of life and you now have a job to do as a mother as a father to stand on my word and manifest it you don't worry about what i'm going to do for them why don't you worry about what i said i would do for you amen and when that happens we can make it all the way from emmaus back in an hour why because we know that we know that we know god is present walking with us hallelujah none of this oh what are we gonna do what are we gonna do you see my brother and sister we've been called to minister the word to the king now look at this this bride hearing this spoken word can someone say amen and this spoken word has been anointed by the holy ghost my brother and sister we're not just we're not just dealing with a message that is just another something that you know uh could have been started by this person or that person this is the revealed word of the hour this is god coming down and proving this is what i meant for this day and i can tell you right now saints the bread has been broken the word has been opened the bread is broken and christ is right here in our midst the prophet of god preaches this over and over again yes there's naysayers that as i've been preaching to you and i will beat against that spirit until i have no breath when they are there saying well this can't be happening because the way we understand it is if he is with us in us here today he's not on the mercy seat so you're wrong well my brother and sister they could interpret that all they want that way but the word says that he's here on the mercy seat which is in the heart of man amen and he's here giving mercy to you and i and part of that mercy is he said this work i have begun in you oh come on somebody get excited this work i have begun in you i'm going to have so much mercy on you in this day that the work i begin i will be right there with you and it will get finished in the meantime we're there lord i failed you again i failed you again lord oh what's wrong with me i've been i've been a message believer for 20 years and i'm still falling down lord help me and he's like don't worry about it my mercy my grace is sufficient for you i will finish this war stand up and say lord forgive me and start going on the road to emmaus again hallelujah amen the devil would like you to stop and build you a pity party camp right there but i'm telling you i'm going to walk on this road right into a rapture right into eternity and i'm not gonna stop for a lion devil hallelujah because the bread has been broken and the word says our eyes of understanding are now opened amen now are you going to deny the word and say no no we've got a message of the hour but we have just many questions today this is a quote actually an individual said i just don't know i don't know whether i believe the message or not anymore because we've been following this message for so long and we have just as many questions today as we did when we started okay when he was on the road to emmaus with jesus was he talking or was you you know it's a problem we have we're very quick lord i need a better job i need a better house i need new clothes i need my kids oh they're all this and i need that and i need that and i need the preacher not to preach so long on sundays because lord he's over there taking a word trying to put it here nope can't fit oh can't get a word in there can't get a word in here and then we're all done or no go on come on saints we're on the road to emmaus is he talking or are we it's one thing to pour our heart out to him but we've got to stop and let him speak we got to stop look at look at kilo hero cleopas and his friend that our hearts not burn within us as he opened the word to us on the way i can see them just walking along and maybe a little comment like lord but what about this and he opens it and they're speaking they didn't go away and said hey guys you know what i i was telling jesus christ all about how this should be no sir maybe present company not included except for myself sometimes we just have so much we want to share don't you just i'll put it this way don't you dislike it when you're talking to somebody somebody's going to say you do that paul but don't you dislike it when you're talking to somebody and you realize that really all they're doing is waiting to tell you what they're thinking they're not listening to you i'm sure glad cleopas and his friend didn't do that they just said okay i don't know who this man is see they didn't have respect of person saints they didn't know this was jesus christ they were just listening and he chastised him right off the bat fools nobody mess is going to talk to me that way brother trevor i'm out of here just i ain't putting up with it 40 years in this message and somebody's going to call me a fool i'm done maybe you just confirmed their words look at this the bride has a ministry though let's look here i want to hurry up the members of the virgin bride will love him they will have his potentials for he is their head and all power belongs to him they are subject to him as the members of our bodies are subject to our heads notice the harmony of father and the son jesus never did anything until it was first showed him by the father john 5 19. this harmony now exists between the groom and his bride he shows her his word of life i want you to catch these things i hope you are he doesn't just show the word of life to anyone he didn't you didn't see in that whole story you didn't see jesus keep turning off here and breaking bread with this man and turn and go over here and break bread with this council and go down here and sit in this public square and break bread he walked with them two men two men two men called of god to a people called of god he's come down and he says i'm going to break bread with you i'm going to reveal myself i'm going to do the very things that stirs something now i hope you catch this i'm trying to condense this down you know the prophet of god remember he said everything this just paraphrased everything you need to make the rapture is at this church over here it's down over here it was back here no no he said it's already in you you realize what was happening cleopas and his friend are walking down the road amen it wasn't that jesus christ was giving them something new my brother and sister he was stirring up their pure minds in remembrance of what was already in them because they were called the very ingredient of your name being on the lamb's book of life place that seed in you and he's there revealing and watering that seed and it's it's there and at the moment he breaks the natural bread it comes to life in them and they said that's it because you see there's a harmony that exists between the groom and his bride he shows her his word of life she receives it she never doubts it therefore nothing can harm her not even death for if the seed be planted the water will raise it up again and here's the secret of this the word is in the bride hallelujah saints this isn't just something hey i stumbled onto it and coming to the message sorry that word is in you as it was in mary the bride has the mind of christ for she knows what he wants done with the word oh hallelujah i know what needs to be done with the word i'm going to preach it and you're going to listen no sir what does he want done with take the book eat it let it come is it bitter in your belly it sure can be when you find yourself being chastised by the word of god lord i just can't do this any longer then you pick your bible up and you read and the word of god tells you you can do all things through christ jesus now you have to decide listen your voice that says i can't do it or listen to the word that says you can do all things that's right you say but but looking at the big things that's so simple brother paul no no it's a lot of simple things now brother isaac could come up here and explain blockchain to us i know it's a word that starts with b and the second word starts with a c blockchain right very complicated but it's quite complicated but blockchain doesn't work if you start leaving out the simple things because it's made up of a series of simple things connected together producing a desired transport or effect would that be fair to say that so we start leaving out the little things i just can't overcome i can't overcome i'm gonna go to church i believe the message i can't overcome you're denying you're actually denying the word don't let the devil cause you to deny it you might feel that you're lower than the carpet but it needs to come from your mouth and say i can do all things i can do all things i can do all things i can do all things i can do all things why because he showed her that's you the word of life did you receive come on if you haven't received it you're in a whole different category now but if you said i believe this word and i believe jesus christ is my lord and savior and i believe that god has called me amen then you have received the word and don't doubt it therefore nothing can harm you not even death people are so worried about this body so worried about this body we so worried about this body millions living lives that will take them straight to hell but we need to vaccinate them because we got to keep that body alive no care for the soul no care for the soul there is no care for the soul the word is in the bride the bride has the mind of christ for he knows what's what done with the word she performs the command of the word in his name for she has thus saith the lord then the word is quickened by the spirit and it comes to pass have any of you ever experienced that hallelujah i'll tell you i've experienced in everything from lost wallets lost car keys amen amen i i love that brother jason you know it's like oh we lost the keys we lost keys what are we going to do what are we going to do what are we going to do sister amy comes driving up in the driveway right in front of our farm shop and go out there and i don't remember who it was was it you brother jason who was it there's the keys now how did the keys get on the cowling right by the the wiper and how did sister emmy drive all the way to boise on the freeway and all the way back and do everything that she did and the keys are just perched on the corner of the car don't tell me there's not a supernatural god hallelujah and just bring this closer to home our little fellowship up in the mountains paul you know unlocked the hitch and changed the hitch and locked it back up and left the keys laying right on the very edge of the tail of the pickup and it rode 130 40 miles up there over not the most smooth roads in the world and my wife picks up the key off the back of the truck right there tell me how that would happen under a normal circumstance you wouldn't get out of the driveway and the keys would have fallen off this little things come on you've got your own stories to tell amen little things answers young people you're going to school you've got tests if you just have faith in god and commit the tests that you're taking and you're learning to the lord he'll come right down imagine jesus christ himself sitting right there in the corner of your death saying now on that one right there it would be this or you can use the method brother paul used in school and it'd be like eenie meenie miney mo the last one was c this one has to be d and the next one is a and that one is b and this one is c or you could actually take time and believe and say lord i'm a daughter of god i'm a son of god and lord i i'm not going to get all nervous and shook up about this i'm going to commit this to you and i'm going to trust you that you would give me wisdom to do this i mean just saying just say it because he said now i'll move on like a seed that's planted water it comes full harvest serving its purpose those in the bride do only his will now look i'm going to say a very pointed statement to you because we're almost done in fact sister emmy wants to come the piano those in the bride will do only his will my brother and sister you cannot step out of the word call it revelation expect the people to digest it and have god put an endorsement on it won't happen god won't accept that you know why well i'll get ahead of myself the bride only do his will no one can make them do otherwise they have thus saith the lord or they keep still they know that it has to be god in them doing the works fulfilling his own word he did not complete all his work while in his earthly ministry so now he works in and what god actually trusts you amen to take his word and put it to work oh my that's not according to a lot of these people you can't you can't you're not going to make the rapture without me your pastor giving you all the spiritual discernment that you need that's not what the prophet of god says he says this bride is going to be so filled with the holy ghost having the mind of god that she will be able to take the word and go start fulfilling manifesting this word to complete the plan of god he did not complete all his work with earthly ministry so now he works in and through the bride look at that she knows that we're not guessing we're not hoping we know for it was not yet time for him to do certain things that he must now do but he will now fulfill man i'll tell you what hallelujah i'm trying to restrain saints and get over this punching back and all these spirits and voices that have worded this and said that whatever voices that say things like without an apostle in your church you'll never get the word right which apostle are you talking about the one with the shiny cadillac or the one with the big house or the one over here or the one down there which one are you talking about because you see a real apostle of god is going to go to the word and then he's going to go out there and he's going to say look saints here's the word here's the word go to the word saints come to the word come to the word you don't have to come to me to go to the word just come to the word [Music] she knows that there is not yet time for him do certain things he must now do but he will now fulfill through the bride that work which he left for this specific time you know what that work is saints it's not for us to go stand on top of the building do many mighty miracles it's for the word to be lived out from the youngest to the oldest satan in battle pounding against trying to deceive trying to trip up trying to discourage and this little bride is simply saying thus saith the lord he said i'm the word the word is in me i will fulfill the word it's my heart's desire it's all i ever wanted to be is just the word manifested in this day that he called me to and i'll do it do i make mistakes well you want quote on that you can find it in the message brother brahm said you will make mistakes the focus is not on the mistake the focus is on your ministry of the word [Music] there is what he's speaking oh my hallelujah you see this bride saints [Music] she will only minister the pure word back to the bridegroom says revelation the only thing my bridegroom will hear is the pure word because he is the word so any wife that loves her husband she's not going to make i don't know sorry for the silly example if he loves apple pie she's not going to go make him some black chocolate something truffle whatever pudding pie you can tell i'm a little prejudiced she's gonna make him an apple pie because she loves them she's not going to make up a pie not just take this tongue-in-cheek brother george comes to our house i look around there i've joked this before and i'm just being transparent with you i want to drive the point home to you i was like wife jerry there's two cream pies here on the counter do you love brother george more than me where's the where's an apple pie where's the cherry pie where where is that she's like you shouldn't be eating them brother george comes in there oh god bless you sister jerry she just beams she just beams thank you now look my brother and sister i hope you catch this point i use that very direct point that's not how the bride's gonna treat christ well our pastor prefers this our church prefers that you guys quit laughing no lord we're going to do it this way no what's this bride going to do he wants me to worship him he wants me to give praise to him he wants me to live a righteous and holy and glorified life singing praises to his name saying lord we love you lord you're so beautiful to me lord i can live without you thank you for everything it's not going to give praise oh it's all about our pastor it's all about our pastor it's all about a pastor it's all god knows her no sir [Music] so you guys will have a conclusion from my little statement brother george come along and says sister jerry where's brother paul's pie [Music] yeah yeah [Music] he left to work for a specific time you see he can't receive any other word and this bribe can't receive any other word because the original that original life is in you and i we are that original life now look first john 2 27 but the anointing which you have received of him abideth in you and ye not that any man teach you but as the same anointing teaches you of all things and his truth and is no lie in even as it hath taught you you shall abide in him what is that that's the holy ghost that's the holy ghost saints leading you guiding you strengthening you bringing you into his presence hallelujah okay one last little quote i want to share with you amen oh hallelujah i was four years old when this was preached right on the dot jesus alone can lead you to that eternal life there's no church no denomination no preacher no priest no nothing else can lead you to it you must be led by him the only one that can lead you could you imagine him leading you out of his word which that's him and if he is the word and you're part of him won't you be a part of the word the word that god wants to pour the waters of salvation upon today to identify him today like the apostles identified him like luther like wesley

perform his word no matter what we think do you know when you look at something like afghanistan you're seeing a physical element taking place right [Music] but that spiritual warfare right here is just as violent and just as prevalent and just as dominating as it is in the physical form mary god that will deliver you will deliver them pray for them this is something sister jerry and i and just
