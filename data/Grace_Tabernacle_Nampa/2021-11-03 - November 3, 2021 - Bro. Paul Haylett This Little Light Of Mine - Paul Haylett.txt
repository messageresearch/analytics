you father i ask you behalf lord with me lord to learn how to express lord what i truly part oh hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah thank you lord jesus thank you lord amen is there any happy people here tonight hallelujah i tell you it's uh you know just things happen in life and you know if we're not careful we'll talk about this lord willing in just a little bit but satan you know he knows how to put the damper you know if you take a stove and you you put the damper down on that you can just all but kill the fire the devil doesn't care that we have a little fire he just doesn't want to turn it into a bonfire which turns into a runaway fire that he can't damper amen hallelujah well let's not forget our brother sergey and her brother vasily and um anyone else maybe that's missing tonight our sister miriam and and arizona over there with their daughter just pray the lord would just uh be very present with them also to remember our brother chris brother flint are hunting amen so maybe they'll be successful you know i've always always really enjoyed hunting but i found my success at uh winco was a hundred percent and uh you know sometimes you know you just do that but god's good and it's not just about finding something but it's time together and fellowship in the great outdoors god's creation and how beautiful that is amen and let's not forget this coming sunday five o'clock communion here at the church amen and uh so let's just turn in our bibles this evening i just want to go into this and be timely tonight but always more you know saints i i if you guys could just see my heart i'm just like lord i just want to bring something profound simple and short to the saints and it always turns into something that is convoluted deluded and long and i'm like lord help me but i just pray saints as we press to the mark of the high calling that the lord just takes the word that's preached ministered from this pulpit and just makes it real in our hearts we don't need a great man with great words we need a great god in our midst and a great spirit to move upon us and so we just thank the lord for that i want to turn to matthew the fifth chapter amen brothers did we turn this screen off or is it not working or no okay well that's good i want to preach to you go backwards here i want to do this i want to preach to you this very very simple little thought of this little light of mine you see we can get all excited saints and and uh i don't want to be rude about it but we can get all excited and look at the great men in our lives great ministers profit etc and we can focus and say they this happened and this happened and this happened but let's stop tonight take a little bit of time and look at this little of mine amen the little light that god has given to you and i amen he didn't want us now you can find the the foundation or fundamentals of this in the message not brother brown's exact words but we're not looking to live in the glow of someone else we want to live in the light and so as we press to the mark of the high calling god loves you and i so much that he sent that little beam of light wherever we were on the face of the earth it didn't matter north south east west what caught none of that matter god says i have as it were a ray or a beam of light for you and to me it just stirs my heart very shall be called the children of god blessed are they which are persecuted for righteousness sake for theirs is the kingdom of heaven now see it moves from somewhat impersonal look how this suddenly now takes a little shift blessed are ye no longer vague not just one of the crowd but god wanted to single you out blessed are ye when men shall revile you and persecute you and shall say all manner of evil against you falsely for my name's sake rejoice and be exceeding glad for great is your reward in heaven for so persecuted they the prophets which were before you ye are the salt of the earth but if the salt has lost his savor wherewith shall it be salted it is thenceforth good for nothing but to be cast out and be trodden under foot of men now i want you to i want you to catch this saints i think if we catch the real essence of verse 13 it'll be very enlightening to us when we catch that when i lose my feeling you use lose your feeling for the saints when we no longer care about the little blanket native when we no longer care about the drunk or the ill-famed dressed woman on the street when we no longer care about the one down the pew from us when we no longer do i need to go any further you see when we have lost that where the prophet of god sees he stops and he says you know what i lost my feeling for the people you see my brother and sister some would say how dare you you're going to judge the prophet by this scripture he judged himself i don't have to judge him he judged himself he said i lost my feeling for the people and i had to get away from them imagine us preachers of just a little assembly like this and we just feel like we have it so rough and the prophet dealt with the spirits of the age dealt with all this ecumenical spirit satan poured everything against him and in his flesh he got battered down just like david said in the psalms though my enemy cast me to the dirt but you see god knows what he's doing so if we've lost that our effectiveness as a christian diminishes right with that loss of feeling for the people ye i love this see it's now becoming more of this scripture here chapter five more and more personal ye are the light of the world a city that is set on a hill cannot be hid neither do you light a candle and put it under a bushel but on a candlestick and it giveth light unto all that are in the house let your light so shine before men that they may see your good works and glorify your father which is in heaven can we say amen to the word tonight heavenly father just ask for your blessings lord give us wisdom and leadership tonight we pray in your name amen you may be seated as i read these scriptures one of the first things that it speaks to my heart is this beautiful oh i don't know if i can express it quite but this absolutely gorgeous opportunity that god gives for us to to show the world our lord jesus christ this opportunity to uh for the world to see christ in us see christ in you and you know it is just uh often times if we're not careful satan will try to just uh by the cares of life rob uh this victory that we have in our joy of who we are in jesus christ and so as satan just batters us and and the things of life just where and where and where uh you know we find ourselves we start to take things inwardly into ourself and we find ourselves uh you might say in a sense offended by the things of life and we find ourselves struggling to enter into the word or or feel the uplifting power of the word and we realize that that is just satan trying to as we spoke on sunday satan trying to take you hostage and so as it is if he can take your mind hostage your heart or your body then you know he's accomplished a great thing but uh we look here in this and we see these words if you have a red letter bible you see these words spoken by our lord jesus and it's there if you go to the beginning of that scripture verse one you'll see that this my brother and sister was actually uh it tells us that jesus when he saw the multitude he then turned and went up into the mountain but you know look at this god sometimes just lets little things turn us one way or the other and it's still god in control right and jesus sees this uh this great multitude and he turns goes up into the mountain the apostles go with him and what a lovely time my brother and sister that god grants to them because they now get a mountaintop experience with the lord jesus christ i'll tell you what i would love to have a mountaintop experience with the lord jesus christ to sit there and have him speak to me and just to pour out his word to us but you know what if we look correctly at the word we have every opportunity to have our mountaintop experience because he is the word and the word is present with us and we take the word with us and we literally in the right spirit the right attitude the right approach can sit on the mountaintop and have our lord jesus christ speak to us amen isn't that beautiful you know so many people will you know i would have loved to been there you know if i had been there i would have i would have been a faithful follower of jesus christ well if you would have been a faithful follower there you'll be a faithful follower here amen so we just thank the lord for his grace and mercy so this mountaintop experience he starts to speak to the apostles and and my brother and sister truly well i just have to admit that would be such an incredible experience amen but you know jesus didn't come and just ra raw them and pat them on the back he actually spoke the words that was necessary to if you don't mind me using this phrase to trim the fat he was there to cut away those things that were unnecessary to lay he was laying in a food for due season my brother and sister and imagine now these apostles as time goes on how uh some good right uh and uh experiences that they're like yep this is what he was talking about but think about how it is that god knowing what is necessary in her life he sometimes speaks words like peter heard now you know in your heart you don't even need an imagination that peter actually thought our lord jesus christ was wrong he literally in his heart was like there's no way i would do that but look how strong the spirits are really it is just let's look at the picture look how strong the spirits are but look it's not just that he was overcome with a spirit but i want you to know that everything happened so quickly and in such a fashion take this to your heart in such a fashion that we can be shouting on the rooftop one day and the next day doubting our experience because we get battered and it's just too much it overwhelms us in the human element and and we're there and so here's peter there ain't no way i'll deny my lord jesus christ now imagine how crushing it must have been in his heart when that crowed he would have been a man that was just so broken in his spirit that he literally i can just see it my brother and sister him declaring i am of no value to my lord jesus christ but you see there was a little something i hope you don't take this too personal tonight but little something in our spirit sometimes that we hold on to so desperately it is somehow we claim it in our identity and that is actually what's keeping us from a complete surrender to the lord jesus christ and god has promised that he would lead us and guide us into all truth and so he's going to come put you in a situation that breaks that little thing you hold so tight but was peter worse off or better off come on saints amen he was better off to have that broken in his life and we would be better off if we would let the lord break things in our lives see he's not here just to crush us my brother and sister he's here the fragrance the essence of the fragrance is not released or revealed until the crushing of the flower and god says you know what i know what's in you the prophet of god said everything you need to make the rapture is in you now my brother and sister if that's bottled up in something in our life then god has promised he's going to come he's going to crush that to release the fragrance of faith the essence of who we are in jesus christ must be released and he will do what is necessary i hope that we can lift our hands on that day and say oh lord thank you instead of oh pitiful man that i am amen so we see these words this mountaintop experience they were admonished they were encouraged now i want you to catch this and and i hope that i can really express this in the way that i felt like the lord laid it upon my heart you see my brother and sister i believe tonight yes the naysayers say that you're a bunch of crackpots is it okay to talk straight the naysayers say you're a bunch of crackpots right that you're whatever but you know what i can sit here tonight and i can seriously look not just picking one man or woman or family or something but i can say i don't see any other position on the earth that i would like to trade mine for this is nothing about this person or that person that church that church that pastor that pastor but looking at our own life i trust that you can say amen to this oh you know i was talking with hired man today and he brought up something about somebody he knew that won a lottery and he's like hmm that means very bad totally messed him up and then i got to joking with him because he's that kind of man i said come on tell me jesus surely surely you could use a little more money and he was like of course i could use more money just like you but not if it does that to me and he says it causes me to think what is good for me and what is bad for me and i want what is good for me can we say tonight we're blessed i mean really truly from the depths of our heart put everything out and just look at that and say is my life blessed or not is god dealing with me is god hearing my prayers is my my life oh but brother paul yeah i know tires go flat cars run out of gas power bills have to be paid all of that goes on but the scripture says it happens to the rich and the poor and it happens to the righteous and the unrighteous wait so if we give up our righteousness we still got these problems and if we inherited millions we would still have these problems so god through his word has declared that we are truly a blessed people now i want to lay a foundation for you here let's go brothers to uh luke the first chapter uh we're going back now is luke's account of uh what happened with uh mary and in the sixth month the angel gabriel was sent from god into the city of galilee named nazareth to a virgin that's me can someone say amen amen to a virgin espoused to a man whose name was joseph of the house of david the virgin's name was mary and the angel came in unto her and said hail thou art highly favored the lord is with thee blessed art thou among women and when she saw him she was troubled at his saying and cast in her mind what matter of salutation this should be and the angel said unto her fear not mary for thou hast found favor with god do you realize my brother and sister if you'll take this into the word of god and if we were going to stay here all night i could lay this out bit by bit for you but i believe as established believers you can put this in place as we look tonight this scripture is actually speaking of you and i amen it is not something uh 2 000 plus years ago but this is a living scripture tonight because god sent an angel right that's what prophets are defined in the word a god sent an angel and come and said that you are highly favored you are blessed to be of those of this generation that names are in the lamb's book of life you talk about a blessing my brother and sister you talk about being highly favored now the definition of blessed or it's a second part definition of blessed is highly favored now can i just remind you a bit here it would be if we kind of feel bad for ourselves uh highly favored are the poor in spirit highly favored are those that mourn highly favored are the meek highly favored are those who hunger and thirst after righteousness are you with me highly favored my brother and sister to the merciful highly favored to those pure of heart highly favored to the peacemakers highly favored those that are persecuted we often look at this and say well okay that's wonderful that's wonderful but it doesn't feel but my brother and sister you see mary didn't get off with just having a child and walking away with no pain and travail mary became an object of ridicule she became an outcast and she bore that her whole life it never diminished it never went away it was never explained away because how are you going to convince someone now pardon we have children here so i just want to express this correct how are you going to claim or express that i now am having a child i have never known a man no one is going to accept that as an explanation and how would you feel as you have went from a charmed young lady into someone that is looked with ridicule and scorn and be able to say i am blessed but you see to bring this into our day because i want to keep this short not draw it out my brother and sister this that has come an angel speaking you have found favor with god well i tell you my brother and sister found it before the foundation of the world when he wrote my name and wrote your name in the lamb's book of life he was bestowing favor upon us he was pouring out blessing upon us and what we see and feeling here all of this today is the devil trying to explain it away trying to rob you of it trying to camouflage it trying to hold it hostage all of that is just what we see and yet we can look and what seems so great and what satan is doing let's go back to what the angel said without mary filled with the holy ghost because she had god in her right so we can take this in that natural she had the holy ghost john would have been born stillborn john would have had follow me a denominational experience and would have been sending all these people to the temple to sign up just like they had for generations a stillborn spirit but at the name of jesus at the name of jesus it filled him with the holy ghost right there in the womb and i want to tell you tonight saints i hope you catch this and correlate it my brother and sister that as the word come forth we were filled with the holy ghost in the womb of god's word we were brought to a place that we were now birthed as a living word in a generation to be expressed of the life of jesus christ and that word had to come through that name amen it's no other way can we come hallelujah so here it is we see now that she is troubled by the salutation but i want to focus tonight so i can move on quickly that we'll look at this and realize that being all of this that he is here in the scripture as we're looking in matthew to realize all of that is us truly finding favor with god just as mary did brother paul mary's experience was supernatural what is yours what is your experience if it's not supernatural saints we can go to any church in this city and get it hallelujah so we look at this and see blessed art thou among women sisters all the way from our children sisters blessed art thou among women we live in a world today and this might come across a little harsh women with dangling earrings and hair is short as mine painted up like a road sign look your face and say i have the holy ghost see how satan has convoluted this no reference no foundation back to word we're not criticizing them i hope that tomorrow they would wake up or maybe tonight when they would go to bed that the spirit of god would speak to them but remember of all the young virgins god chose mary god's choice hallelujah now the word said here that ye are the light of the world i want to drive that home to you so you'll understand where i'm coming from in some of these statements that i will make in a little bit ye are the light of the world the city that is set on a hill and cannot be hid and we see now men don't light a candle and put it under a bushel but on a candlestick and it giveth light unto all that are in my house that i have applied the token to you know i spoke on that the other day i believe there was a little misunderstanding by some you see my brother and sister we never stop we never stop applying the token i don't care if your kids are drunk i don't care if your kids slept with every human on the face of the earth you never stop i know that's blunt but we don't like to talk about that we like to keep everything all flowery and all just my brother and sister the plying of the token in the house starts with the head of the house and it moves down through the proper course amen we can't skip that we can't do that and if we don't have the house in order what does the word say about a minister his house has to be in order right we can't skip around that we have to get the house in order and i trust that we as priests of our home would recognize we have to get our house in order if we want god to come down here we can't be hypocrites we have to be original we have to do that to present that and i don't mean to skin no one over this but this is the things that the lord laid on my heart and so you see as we come now we apply this to the whole house and as we apply it to the house my brother and sister let me just use it as a simple paraphrase our children our husband our wife whatever it might be breathes the same air in that house and they dwell in the spirit of the house if this spirit's a contrary spirit then you wonder why your kids are rebellious right if we dwell in a house of a submitted spirit yielded to the holy ghost then we will see and say oh isn't god moving amongst our children if this is so beautiful you see we are the one who's setting the atmosphere and applying that so there it is now it giveth light unto all that are in the house and i tell you i'm not the best example i hate to admit that in front of you church then i've got children that could tell you stories that you guys would go oh my i don't know if i even want that guy for my pastor amen reminds me of a little prank i pulled today and i won't mention it here but it uh you know we got to be careful because sometimes the little things we do can become believable because of the actual view that we've left in people's hearts in their minds in their eyes let me move on before i get this too complicated you see we look at this and realize now is for me either that or i don't need a wagon at all hallelujah whatever it is it's god's amen so the word declaring that we are the light of the world can someone say amen to that now look john one through five you're you're very familiar with this but i just wanna just lay this as a foundation we move forward hopefully a little quicker here john one through five one one through five in the beginning was the word and the word was with god and the word was god i think we all say amen we can agree with that the same was in the beginning with god all things were made by him and without him was not anything made that was made in him was life hallelujah we know the life is in him certainly not in this world and the life was the light of men so now if we are going to be that light that is lit and placed on the hill we have to have jesus christ almighty god in us amen but yet there's spirits in the land today my brother and sister just as it was let me just just jump back here just as it was and and i preached this enough i think brother david's preached on it but go back in the beginning and you'll see that that the serpent depersonalized god and it went in the scripture for a brief period of time till the transgression took place that he took him from being the lord god to just god and that's what's happening in the day that we're living in people not making the connection or the correlation between the fact that who they are is because god has taken residence amen now brother donnie reagan used it for talking about how a wolf would be in sheep's clothing if any of you ever actually saw him preach that and he does it so well he got that wolf there and he's just putting a leg on arm in arm in zip but a wolf has to talk like a wolf there now i want to take a little different angle if we could grasp this and i know that people would say he's lost his mind and that's cool i have and i'm so glad i've lost my mind but almighty god come down in this hour and he took you brother trevor and he put you on almighty god himself stepped right inside and said trevor as a man could never do it but me he uses it in first person i in you hallelujah all of a sudden this man we know is trevor that could if we ever buried his heart which i have had you know those experiences to have very deep conversation and i don't make light of that i believe it's just an absolute beautiful example and so in that the devil says there's trevor and god says there's me a whole different approach the devil's looking at the weakness and god says i'm looking at the vessel and the vessel is mine that's all he's looking for my brother and sister he was looking for the vessel that he could occupy so it was there in him was life and the life was the light of men and the light shineth in darkness now we could not fulfill this scripture my brother and sister unless this wicked dark world was just exactly what it is right now we could not in our day manifest this very light that god is wanting to be manifested if it wasn't a complete darkness in this world today amen so it's the life that is the light and this light is shining in darkness and the darkness out here doesn't comprehend it at all they don't get it they don't get one thing out of this they just like think you're religious that's the way they look at it you're religious you go to church they don't make a connection of the word that god said i would be walking on the war on the earth in the world in the last days showing myself oh my my brother and sister they're they're literally many people believe there's got to be as it is the same spirit muhammad's got to come back we've got to see mohammed now that spirits come over in the message and people are saying we've got to see but they fail to see the light is here it's on the hill it's shining it's being made manifest it is right here in the world we live in today amen this blessing of life that is in you can someone say amen for that this blessing of life that is in you is the very life of jesus christ manifested it's no longer on the page it is now walking on the earth once again shining the living word amen that's what the gospel is my brother and sister it's not just a dead letter it's a living word a life and the life is now shining into the world because god has come in his dwelling in you and manifested himself through you now sometimes we say kind of hard things and i don't mean to hurt anybody my brother and sister but you see we have to be careful that we don't deviate from the word amen we can't make the word more than it is we can't make it less than it is hallelujah so what is this christ in you the hope of glory right this is christ in you the manifested light this is the light for the day my brother and sister now when we get to the closing if i can make it there we'll go now in to whom would we go if they'll put that up now you can go ahead and join church it's a good thing or you can serve your creed a good thing oh and by the way for those of you that might choke on creed we actually have quite a few of them in the message because it's not all bad it's just what's outside the word the remnant of the creed is what is the problem go look it up dig deep yep you might belong to lodges you might do these these things i have nothing to say against them but what i'm trying to say this is you need light see none of the rest of this matters my brother and sister because we can go right back to john 1 and that's why we have that as a reference tonight you can go back to john 1 and realize there is the very very very fundamental of it all that god is light and so if we're going to have light in this generation to fulfill this scripture we've got to have him in us amen you need light and the light is christ and he's the only one that can give light and you might turn that light on a bunch of dirt down here with ever so many grains of corn in it that light will never produce life no sir that artificial light won't produce life it takes the sunlight the rays of the sunlight you say what difference is it if it's just as light as the sun it hasn't got the power of the ray in it to bring forth life and neither has the light of any creed or anything else outside of jesus christ he's god's light beautiful huh now look i'm going to drive this home to you so there's just uh we'll we'll clinch it here in a few minutes but my brother and sister you have to have an understanding of the godhead you cannot have a convoluted a messed up kind of think i know what the godhead is to understand this because then this is where in the whole world of the trinity they get all mixed up and then you're sitting there and i like to study and look into these kind of things and you have a very well-known name in the religious world explaining the trinity and then he makes a reference to a certain uh deal and and then you know they even have a trinity institute you know and they're the ones that print the stuff and make it all very clear and got all the explanations and he's counter-addicting and then when they know they're counter-addicting they say well it's just so confusing it's really hard to explain we shouldn't have that problem amen we can go back to the word of god and god promised to reveal that word to us we shouldn't have a problem understanding the godhead amen we shouldn't have a problem trying to put this all together of who stands where and in what position this is now if you've ever seen the official circle of the trinity and i won't go into explaining it they have that you know laid down very clearly of what is and what isn't and then they used scripture to defend it but they forgot to use the scriptures that rebut it isn't that interesting when you get in a a situation like that i have all kinds of evidence what about this empirical evidence that says your evidence is wrong i get to choose the evidence it's my story you've all heard that phrase it's my story i'll tell it like i want to it's irrelevant whether truth or not is in the story it's my story so this uh in artificial light's not going to produce life it takes a real sunlight you say what difference if it's just as light it hasn't got the power of the ray in it to bring forth light now my brother and sister if you go back and study the age of the greenhouse wasn't a hundred years ago it took science delving into the right kind of light and they've done all kinds of research they literally have sequenced lights and they can study the behavior of plants you'll never eat another head of lettuce after you watch this because you can hear it and you'll think it's breathing and thinking and flowers under the emphasis of rock and roll wilt flowers with sequenced lights following the light because they want light look at the lives of men and women always seeking something to enlighten the soul always my brother and sister now this sounds a little crass forgive me but one of the original founders that was doing them squirrel suits and flying suits they asked him how could you take such a risk he he drilled his head into a rock in a canyon he no longer exists how can you take a risk and his answer was i've done everything else every thrill that there is and this is where i'm at tries to fly between two spires in a canyon and misjudges it and his life is over what was he doing looking for something i'll equate it to you tonight he was looking for light he was looking for something that would actually bring something into his soul that he would be able to declare life is fulfilled but he was unable to to bring it to that place of life is fulfilled see so it doesn't have the power of the ray no matter what we do my brother and sister doesn't have the power of the ray to bring forth light neither has the light of any creed or anything else outside of jesus christ he's god's light and he's the one that give us the holy spirit and when we live in his presence it makes us act different look different talk different be different because we're walking in the light and now earlier i made those statements about people and i i this way you know i hope you understand me it's never personal to me a god has like scorched that out of me it's never personal my brother and sister you want to see those people have a good life you want to see them know jesus christ you want to see this but you see we get to see because of what god has showed us because we're blessed to see in the word we get to see what the absence of light does to humanity and so without that light there to turn them are you with me it takes the light to turn them and without that they're walking in darkness see and we're blessed today and should be able to lift a hand in the heart and say thank you lord i am blessed i have found favor because there's something in our hearts that desires to serve god there's something in us amen as i've said before under free moral agency aren't you glad for free moral agency i'm in the house of god tonight not because i'm the speaker i'm not here tonight because i'm pastor i'm here tonight because there's something in my heart that says this is who you are and the only thirst that there can be to satisfy it is right there in the perfect word of god hallelujah amen now i want to move right on here real quick brothers let's bring up this um paragraph 20. amen now don't you see the great picture we in flesh are different now i'm not tootin no one's horn but it was sister kerry's absolute if i could just express it to you it was sister carrie in the restaurant paul i was just reading and it's like anything that generates that kind of excitement needs to be read amen hallelujah sister jerry's filled my phone up with quotes out of the oneness but it's good because i'm going to quote a couple of them to you tonight i read them already but she was excited like sister kerry to share them and that that but look at this now we in flash okay everybody reach up pinch yourself we're like a byproduct a created being by holy wedlock yeah but in this but in spirit we are sons and daughters not some other spirit but the spirit of the living god see this is what separates this old flesh and our problems we have with this old flesh amen it's what separates us my brother and sister from it controlling our life to realizing that this flesh is this flesh and it's a byproduct hallelujah amen not some other spirit the spirit of living god we're in his likeness in his unity in the perfect image of the living god because we become sons and daughters not separated but the same spirit the same god the same person joined in wedlock to the eternal see how god planned it that we should not uh we should be not a different but him amen we are not my brother and sister we say well how are we going to be like him well if god's looking on the heart what does our heart look like flesh isn't going to do it unfortunately my brother and sister i hope you can take this with little humor tonight if we're going to all look the same in the flesh which one are we going to be you all want to look like me no there's a lot of heads shaking no and some are very verbal so who do we choose but look what god's producing in the heart and soul of sons and daughters of god a perfect image of the original word being molded informed have you ever been around brother jason will you ever been around cnc machines i think whether isaac has too you can take a modern day cnc machine and you can program the computer on that and if you're cutting something out of aluminum you can feed 10 000 blocks of aluminum in that machine and every one of them will come out exactly the same and it's not the machine that's doing it the machine is only producing what was placed in it to produce so you can look at this machine and say praise god we're going to be in the perfect likeness of god no sir it's what god loaded in this right here that's going to produce that it will never be us take that program out of that cnc machine and it won't have any idea on how to produce what you wanted to produce you can take that completely over here and put it in another machine and produce exactly and my brother and sister if you can catch my thought tonight that's why you will find that this message is producing the exact same heart and desire and life all the way around the backside of the earth and no man ever produced that because it's what god loaded as it were into the hearts of sons and daughters of god that is producing that word hallelujah but not some other being of some other tribe the real union an offspring of the almighty done by the holy union now the body comes from mother and father but the spirit come from god god separating himself as adam was separated i hope you caught the essence of that amen look it's his spirit his life his light the only light we have to walk in my brother and sister is not a light of this message unless you define this message as jesus christ and when you define this message is jesus christ it takes all the little shadows and the little doubts and all the confusing things and takes them away let's go back to oneness again paragraph 171 we're coming down to the end now watch god sent the holy ghost somebody read the next line for me is that not powerful does that not wipe away a few shadows that little confusion that comes got the holy ghost i can take myself right back and i hope you don't think i've stepped too far but i'm gonna go right back and i'm gonna peel back the pages as it were of john 1. come on saints and i'm going to step right into john 1 and i am now the light to this world whoa you sir took a lot on yourself paul no i didn't i took the word and the word is clearly showing us that we are the light to this generation we are the light in this day god could have come put himself right back just as he did in that day if he had chose but he said i've got some people on the earth and i'm going to be inside them but oh get this now when a man and a woman are one right truly in love truly married not just as a man said once under the rules of engagement really married in other words a man scripturally is completely submitted to his wife oh no around the message we don't talk like that no sir never talk like we are fully submitted to our wife go read your bible go study the word of god husbands love your wives as christ loved the church what was it fully submitted god didn't say i'll save you up to a point i'll save you up to the philadelphia church age those of you in laodicea you're on your own no sir fully submitted to the salvation of the body that he calls bride fully submitted and the wife according to the word fully submitted to her husband remind me one time maybe i shouldn't even go there i won't go there sometimes memories are not good i'm going to tell you it's i'll tell you part of it the humorous part i knew a brother years ago just terrible the way he treated his wife just terrible he treated her even as a teenager i thought my goodness he treats her like she was a slave not a wife but i was around him long enough to see a metamorphosis taking place in this sister we're sitting in a fellowship somewhere in a table and these brothers all sprawled out i mean you can't really get up and do much after 25 000 calories and uh he'd be sitting there in the chair and he'd say wife woman get me some coffee and you used to see her she just more metamorphosis taking place she started realizing as the word was being preached she started changing she changed before he did maybe she made him change probably not it got to a point he'd be like wife woman get me some coffee and she'd be in the other room i can't hear you sounds rebellious doesn't it until one day a brother sitting at that same table says you know why don't you just get up and get your own coffee maybe brother shaming ain't bad i don't know but my point i'm saying my brother and sister the balance the balance this sister wasn't rebellious she was looking for balance she wasn't a slave she wanted to serve him and sometimes lord help us is this a confession booth sometimes we should put please but we take it for granted sometimes we just take it for granted this belongs to us when the word of god said come boldly to the throne of god god did not want us to walk up there and say lord you owe this to me he wanted us to come boldly and say lord you promised you said and i'm asking in your name and your precious name and your powerful and glorious name what a difference when this same brother before he moved away from idaho caught a revelation of that even as a teenager i marvel what a response it would be honey would you please get me a cup of coffee and i think before the words got out of his mouth because she had a discernment that after he had eaten he wanted some coffee she was right there with a cup of coffee isn't that beautiful lord help me amen you see he's the one that will make the oneness between god and man you see it's a holy ghost and you and i the light saints the light when the scripture i hope this forever changes in this positive fashion i hope this forever changes how you look at this scripture because it's no longer just us trying to follow some light moving the light is moving the gospel light is moving keep following the light we are the light it is the holy ghost god himself in you and i are the light to this world that we live in hallelujah and i'll quickly close here sister emmy will you come amen now look at this so these words i want to put out to you god is life amen god is light god is in me i have become god's light to this generation now let's turn to revelations 22 brothers and we are we are closed here and behold i come quickly and my reward is with me to give every man according as his work shall be i'm alpha and omega the beginning in the end the first and the last so god is clearly in his word defining who he is in his position one of full complete control and authority there's no other above behind underneath or anything he is it highly favored highly favored are they that do his commandments some people are like i'm just under this more this is all i'm sorry you're highly favored that god placed something in you to say lord i want to live your word i want to do your word i want i want to i want to be a participant blessed are they that do his commandments that they may have right to the tree of life and may end through the gates into the city do you understand my brother and sister the difference i hope you catch this go study it out to have rights [Music] we have it in our mind everybody comes before saint peter and he thumbs through a book looking for her name do you recognize the name oh here you are there's all kinds of jokes through the years all kinds of jokes you know people but my brother and sister it's not really that way because you see the word in us has given us full authority to the tree of life who is that what is the tree of life saints christ himself full access to our lord jesus christ and we have the right to enter into the gates of the city and it says without our dogs and sorcerers whoremongers murderers idolaters whosoever loveth and maketh a lie i jesus has sent my angel to testify unto you these things in the churches once again we're looking i want you to take this we're not going to trace it all out for you tonight i want you to take this once again god chooses to bring the word through an angel [Music] mine angel to testify unto you these things in the churches once again restoring us back to an understanding it's all about him it's not about how big our church is not about how much money it's got not about who knows who but it's all about him i'm the root in the offspring of david the bright morning star and look we've quoted this scripture so many times my brother and sister but i want you to catch this i pray you catch this tonight and the spirit and the bride say come and let him that heareth say come and let him that is a thirst come and whosoever will let him take the water of life freely now this might come as a little jarring thing to you [Music] the holy ghost speaking to a generation [Music] but they can't hear the truth scriptural they can't hear they can't hear that and jesus the messiah the sought after one they have words in the hebrew for that the sought after one stood right in their midst and they repudiated him and rejected him and god says you know what i could come down and i could move in the miraculous and they did in brother brown's ministry look my brother and sister there was voices that echoed in the rafters not man-made god spoke audible but do you know where really god is speaking of this generation the spirit holy ghost and this bride are they two separate no sir no there's one the spirit and the bride god using this shell as we would call it this vessel and his anointed spirit to speak through us to a world to our children to those we work with those around us you see i and you have become the light oh i'm not making a doctrine we're not going to come up with another part about how whoo look at us we're just looking at the word and if god is in me hmm they're the prophet of god that i wouldn't quote did it did it say what i thought it said or did i get confused that the holy ghost and god are one [Music] and if the holy ghost and god are one [Music] and it's christ in you the holy ghost and god and christ obviously have to be the same i give you a quote for that if you struggle with that one you see my brother and sister this holy spirit that's speaking look how important it is look i i know this kind of comes and maybe grates on some people i'm sorry i don't mean to but there's spirits moving in the age that are trying to separate once again and put bishops over men over people over the commoner on the pew [Music] and i'm here to tell you that the only thing that will separate us is either we're light or we're not that's all that matters everyone else has to be filled with the holy ghost go look what brother branham said about mary amen she was highly favored but brother brown said she had to have the holy ghost be filled with god just like the rest of them amen no exemption because the supernatural took flicked and hurt oh praise god i don't want i preached too long amen we need a big buzzer hallelujah i don't want the distraction please don't give me one of them things up here that goes tick tick tick maybe flashing on the screen or something hallelujah you know brother david's like no no no no no no way but look at this i i just tonight i wanted to bring this to you in this fashion my brother and sister that we could just stop and recognize who we truly are in jesus christ we are not just some people trying to live a godly life we have been a completely integrated system now in the farm world my brother and sister that's a big catch word now we we need to be a fully integrated well hallelujah i am fully integrated my name was on a book i was birthed [Music] i was brought forth into maturity that was part of it i cut out of this brother brown talking about the church coming in her maturity and in that maturity i saw who i was and in a further stage of maturity i was able to act on [Music] who i really was you see if we know who we are but we don't act on it then there's no way we can walk in that light but when we reach the point we come in maturity to act on the word that's when we recognize i can loose in the name of jesus christ i can bind in the name of jesus christ oh hallelujah hallelujah my own mind let's just stand worship the lord for just a minute amen i'd like to sing that little song holy spirit that are welcome in this place just dealing in our own soul see i'm not talking about a building not talking about grace tabernacle holy spirit there you are welcome in this place right here in my life amen hallelujah okay i asked you earlier if there's any happy people in church or is there still some happy people in church amen hallelujah hallelujah holy spirit thou art well come in this place holy spirit thou art well come in this place of mercy and grace thou art well come in

thou art [Music] truly lord you are welcome father we open our hearts and our lives for father the light of the gospel is father lighting our way father that we can walk with confidence father that our faith is not in us not in this world but father truly our faith is in you and you alone for the light in us father is the very light that you've shown lord it's not our light it's you and we say thank you thank you lord jesus let's sing that song we are the generation uh 385 i believe is what brother jason told me before the service was just on my heart this afternoon and my i realized as you look at the words just how you can sing it you can really chew a song up by putting your own little something but it's personal right something at the time you know that you just sing it out and suddenly that becomes your song hallelujah you believe this song that you're reading right here hallelujah we are the generation thank you lord are the combination the final voice the world will hear the the coming overcoming since temptation truth will go to every tongue and nation we are a chosen generation sing it again we are the generation since temptation the truth will go to every tongue in nation we are the chosen generation hallelujah amen that was just speaking to me today amen it's by revelation we recognize who we are hallelujah now i want to lighten your hearts a little bit as we're dismissed and we're going to sing this little light of mine hallelujah amen because mother and sister i want you to realize the devil wants you to think that your light is this little flickering something that is being tossed by the breeze and almost going out but this little light is durable it's strong it has faith it shines when it's snowing it shines when it's raining it shines when the wind is blowing and it shines pardon me i don't like to use these words but i'm going to it shines when all hell assails me amen that's how durable this little light is amen well [Music] this little light [Music] [Applause] blow it out i'm gonna let it shine pour don't laugh satan blowing out i'm gonna let it shine it out i'mma gonna let it shine let it try let it shine let it shine when it'll
