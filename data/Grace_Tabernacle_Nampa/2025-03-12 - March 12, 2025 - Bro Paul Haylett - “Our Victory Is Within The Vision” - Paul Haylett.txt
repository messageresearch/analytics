God bless you of Thanksgiving I Will Bless thee oh oh my [Music] Lord amen it's good to be in the house of the Lord tonight amen what a blessing that God has given us this opportunity to be able to come freely amen the only restriction we have is what Satan tries to throw out before us the speed bumps and the troubles but by God's grace we are here I just uh have a few requests as it is first off um happy to see our brother Sergey sister Luba amen you have a very special heart in uh our church here and obviously your family but God bless you let's not fail to remember our brother Gideon it's in a season right now he needs somebody at his back Amen Let It Be us amen that stands up for him you know sometimes you have something on your heart and and then today I'm just listening to the prophet as I'm working and uh he was talking about that how those that are faithful they don't push down yeah that's right they lift up and let's be lifting for our brother amen and let's remember our brother Manasseh I forgot his wife's name I thought it was Katie is that right yes it is let's remember them I believe God's doing something brother Mass has been reaching out and um you know I I just uh I love that young man uh with a huge chunk of my heart and uh we just want to lift him and Katie up in prayer amen now I don't know that we Fellowship so much you know just the way things are sometimes but brother Salim and his sister sister Wonder been fellowshipping coming as much as they can sometimes we don't see them uh but uh work is varied and uh brother Salim is in need of work and uh we just want to lift that uh before the Lord uh that the Lord would just provide him a job sister Wander wants a job that allows her to come to church she's probably at work right now and um you know uh sometimes I hear a few Sundays ago uh I'll just be blunt about it she fell asleep in church but we probably would have all also if we had worked almost the whole night so we just want the Lord to come on this scene for brother Sim and sister wonder and uh in the whole works the Lord's in control but uh they got family that's supposed to be in transition uh Refugee status to come here uh and seems like all of that's went into slow motion uh we want God's perfect will amen my daughter jool Lin sister jool ly has uh uh you might say a little bit self-inflicted but she has quite a school load that she's working a job and and trying to do her schooling so we want to definitely um uh you know lift her up before the Lord amen and uh my sister sister Susan has been notified that her job is ending so we want to help her by praying for her amen so I don't know if we missed a prayer request uh we've missed any acknowledgments um uh the Lord forgive us and uh just help us the Lord knows amen I want to speak to you thank you musicians a lovely song service appreciate our musicians amen some of them are awall but um the Lord knows that also and uh we will do you guys know what awall means absent without leave anyway um don't want to be labor that I want to speak to you tonight uh on uh a thought our Victory is within the vision and uh we take this out of uh message we'll get to it here in a little bit uh and you will catch this at that time but remember our Victory is within the vision amen so when when you see what God has done in our day every drop of what the opening of the word was here to give the bride victory in leoda we're not here he didn't bring us this far to abandon us or to see us lose the battle but it every drop of it is to bring us into a position of Victory now I believe that was brother Kenny caps here a few years ago now brother Kenny is a very Lively guy I was kind of thinking we might ought to bring him here and get some of us a little more lively also but brother Kenny uh you know was making the point that uh why do we need to wait till then to do our Victory lap and when you think about that my brother and sister now this is not to cause us to just go running wildly around the church you can have your Victory lap in your prayer Closet in your car at work or whatever but you see we're always looking off somewhere into the future that oh we're going to have this victory but the word says we have Victory now and so let's just believe the word and act upon that today and and let the word speak to our heart let's turn in Proverbs 28:19 very common scripture I just preached on it here uh recently as part of a thought there but uh it just come back to me as we were looking and saw these things in the message and uh I just uh got a little excited amen now the Lord just help us tonight proverbs 2918 where there is no vision the people perish but he that keepeth the law happy is he amen Lord we ask you for your blessing upon the word in the name of Jesus Christ amen God bless you good to see you my friend amen you may be seated now when you look at the definition of vision uh it it says it's an ability to see but it's also an ability to think or plan the future and so it's easy for us to look into the past and uh many times now but as we go I think this will all fall in place I trust that it does uh but we can look into the past and we can see our victories and we can also see our defeat and Satan certainly would cause us to focus on our defeat and it seems as though Satan whenever we would look in the past and say boy I I see this time I see Victory there I saw the Lord coming on the scene now often times we talk about don't be looking back but my brother and sister sometimes I think it maybe is good for us to stop and look back and see what the Lord has done as a reminder now when Israel was going through the Wilderness and crossing over the Jordan God stopped them and they put these pillars these landmarks and they were there not for the moment to glory in but for other generations to be able to see that there was a victory that there was an overcoming and so let's not talk about it in an arrogant I did this sister Jerry and I just visiting about this today it's not the fact that we can say I was here I prayed for them I preached this service but it is more like the privilege that God gave us to be part of what he was doing it is not us not one portion other than as a surrender vessel and then the Lord says I'm going to use you and I give you the privilege to be part of my plan part of my work maybe part of a Deliverance probably part of a healing whatever it might be we were given the privilege to be part of that and so it's not so bad sometimes to see the past and certainly here in the present if we are not seeing the Lord move in our midst today something's missing there should be a time of desperation if we are not seeing God present in our lives now my brother and sister when we look into the future our problem is is often times we look at it and say you know when this happens well my brother and sister that's your thought God didn't say I'm going to redeem you save you deliver you uh heal you when this happens he gave us a word and that word is as solid as the very Earth we stand on today more solid he's the one who created this Earth more solid than this Earth we stand on and he doesn't put conditions on it the way we do now my brother and sister he does put conditions like when it comes to receiving the baptism of the Holy Ghost we don't go live like the world immerse in the world act like the world and claim the Holy Ghost now people do claim that but they're actually fooling themselves when they claim that because God says I'm going to wash you I'm going to prepare you then I'll fill you amen so look at that but we don't want to make that too complicated and you see much of this is actually expressed under man's Vision so we see today a man has got a vision and and this is not nothing wrong with that but man has a vision but what the prophet showed us very clearly is we need to make sure our vision lines up with God's Vision because we can have a vision of our own of what we believe God should do or how he should do it and actually miss the mark now as you study and listen to the message you'll know that these are words that the prophet of God said so we're not here to create our own Mark we're here to have our lives hit the mark of the word now it's going to take the word to guide us to the word right amen it'll never be flesh never be carnal man never be intelligence never be the the Natural Things taking us to the word but it's always God so I want to ask you the last time that you had an aha moment amen there was an element right there that you did not go back to and say man I'm so glad I figured this out it's always just that the aha moment God opening the word you're listening to the prophet you've picked up your Bible suddenly something ties together something speaks to you and you know that flesh did not do that intelligence did not do that learning did not do that that is the presence of God that's the Holy Spirit guiding you amen into the word well thank you Lord amen now you see my brother and sister we've got two sides of this we got man's vision and uh you know if you read a little history you'll it'll talk about here in the United States and I believe every nation would be the same they give some credit to certain men who had a vision of what should happen and do that but my brother and sister we know according to the word of God even the great founders of this Nation right here they say oh George Washington Abraham Lincoln their Vision my brother and sister they had no vision it was God forming this nation to fit the scripture amen he did not write the scripture to fit what the nation would have ply become but the nation was formed to the scripture and did that so even these great men were then anointed by God to to speak to do to guide direct what whatever and it is that there is a vision that must take place and so as we'll see this we go away from man's vision and we'll go into uh brother bram's life for just a minute or two here my brother and sister you see how God use that and and many things the prophet of God is said in the past now people have said we believe this this happened here and this happened here so this must happen here but brother and sister you see the prophetic vision is going to override the carnal Vision there's nothing there that's going to override the word so we don't have to worry about it if people say oh this is we prophesied my brother and sister I don't want to speak any negative thing tonight but my brother and sister through the years I've heard a lot of prophecies that never came to pass now if we focus now do we agree with that no I'm not talking about denomination I'm talking about the word world I'm talking around the message and they prophesy these things they don't come to pass we can get uh doubtful we can say well this must not be but my brother and sister if you weren't the one that was there making the prophecy that doesn't come to pass you don't need to worry about that you need to stick with the vision of the word and stay with that because whatever is there good people godly people maybe misguided people whatever it might be but remember you're not responsible for their vision you're responsible for your vision so the prophet comes and he starts to open the word to us and my brother and sister the message as it has been preached has brought forth and is contained and I bear with my words many Mysteries yet to be revealed now you can take that and say wait it says all the Mysteries will be revealed but my brother and sister let me put it in this context there's men and women out here not even saved yet that I believe God has called the mystery still has to be revealed to them see we can bring it all in and say these things are all done but until it's done with the last one in the bride it's not finished and I say thank you Lord so we look at this this scriptural or spiritual vision something coming from the Lord revealed to man now my brother and sister you would look at that and we study the scripture we study stud the message and and we tend to say oh I see this now but remember every Revelation is a supernatural element that's right it has to be Supernatural God revealing his own word amen and he brings it to pass interprets it to his Believers to his people and it actually is much more Supernatural than we actually give credit for people say where is the supernatural every time the word is open to you a supernatural event took place otherwise we would be sitting here today intellectual Believers there's nothing wrong with being a smart individual a studied individual that understands and sees things but we need to constantly go back and let the spiritual element guide our understanding amen now look at this just a simple maybe too simple of an example but uh brother brandham you know originally his interpretation understanding about the horse riders and then he comes back later and says no the Lord revealed it to me this is what it was now you'd say oh oh that happened to the prophet it happens to you that's right it's happening to you today cuz God promised you could not be deceived and so everything that we might be to the edge of God's promise that you cannot be deceived is going to pull you you back into the word just as it did the prophet on some of these doctrinal things and so we look at that oh I'm not trying to put us there with the prophet but yet I am because everything that was poured into Christ was poured into the church and the first fruits the law of the first fruits means that everything that come to the prophet has come to you now we're not called to be prophets I'm not called to to uh uh prophesy and and do those things but yet you'll find that you actually are you prophesy when you stand up and say I am going to praise God and glorify him today I'm going to be an overcomer in this day and March out of the house you are prophesying your day that's exactly right and the people think out here in the denominational world that that's all a lot of them oh that's all crazy but it's the word that's right it's the word that's why the prophet of God said don't be letting those negative things that's right come out of your mouth because you're prophesying negative but let us speak the positive I'm going to be an overcomer today amen I'm going to serve God with all my heart mind body and soul the rest of this week I am going to walk faithful I'm going to stand on this and Satan you might try to Buffet me but the word says amen what are you doing you're claiming your position by Spoken Word now you can keep those silent if you want but I'm finding it's more effective when you speak it amen so it's there that something coming from the Lord is revealed to man that's Supernatural That's not a carnal thing too many people have carnal lied is that a word I almost said carmalized carnal lied they've carnal lied the move of God they just like yeah okay God's doing this but my brother and sister let's stop and realize every footstep is this not the word every footstep that you make has been ordered of the Lord that is a supernatural event taking place because he has already saw that footprint that step and has given his approval to it and if not my brother and sister it would be different but God is allowing us to walk the journey that we walk just like job amen he had to walk that Journey my brother and sister just like Gideon amen Gideon walked by that rock there at the wine press uh 100 if not a thousand times until one day Revelation strikes him it's not some little oh I have an urge but God come Supernatural Revelation and here is Gideon realizing he's talking to a rock and that rock is Christ amen and that Supernatural event taking place in Gideon's life changed him amen entirely amen now you think about these things my brother brother and sister and I and that's been a subject I haven't preached on for quite a while but you you know it's it's very interesting because just a few things changed it such as take them all down to the brook and have them take a drink is that spiritual yes it's very spiritual but without understanding from the Lord it just sounds like he's picking on these guys that that tend and put their face in the water and he's given these others but you see my brother and sisters a lot of spiritual uh scriptural depth into this of what he was looking for so at the opening of a word it was not a man's effort my brother and sister when the prophet of God comes and says you know uh in the middle of the night you know 3 4:00 and the Lord was speak excuse me speaking to me and and and these things we can look at that now we weren't there to to experience it but we're going to touch on some things about experience in a minute but I hope right now that I'm talking to a people that have experienced what it is to have God come and wake you up people who that know that God is speaking to you and it's time for you maybe to roll over uh put your face to the floor put that and and speak back to him not just say oh I have insomnia I can't sleep my brother and sister that might be the human uh uh uh diagnosis of it but most the time I would say that it's God waking you up God wanting to have a conversation that we were too busy in the day to have and he wants to speak to us amen so the opening of the word is not a man's effort cuz I can say right now no man can open the word amen you can study that you you read and you know I love to read and these people say we'll never fully understand the Bible until we learn Hebrew and the aramic I'll tell you we'll never fully understand the until we get sincere enough before God to come to the place he says I will reveal myself to you amen it's not about learning words and definitions it's about Christ himself in the written word revealing himself and education will not give that to you and so God is using men but God is not allowing man to take the rain amen amen we look at the church age book when you see what was written laid out there the seals when you see what is written out there my brother and sister they're the Deep things of the word you can't understand the age we live in without understanding those two books amen you can say well God's come there's going to be a Rapture my brother and sister what God's doing is leading us up to the Revelation and the revelation of the Rapture will be manifested in us it's not intellectually collected or put together in a library but it's actually leading us to that Revelation and so it's there within the vision amen inside the vision my brother and sister is our Victory it's not a victory that's just obvious to the world today I I I I would say some things they sound kind of a little harsh I guess I would say but my brother and sister people stab at the word they're trying to dig in they're trying to get a hold of this and they're standing up and saying oh the Lord told me my brother and sister the Lord told them something completely contrary to the word of God I'm sorry the prophet of God said God would never lead you away from his word and so we sit here today to see that God is bringing us to a place that the very Vision that we see as Sons and Daughters of godone is his vision it's not our vision now you know God's promise of the Mysteries being revealed can we explain all the Mysteries no where are they revealed at people are looking for a mystery explained on a written page projected on his screen but the real mystery the final mystery of who we are is revealed in this Tabernacle amen God is not putting his word out here for an intellectual man to dissect it like a sentence but he's revealing it and Sons and Daughters of God and vessels that he knows he can trust and that mystery is now starting to be revealed but my brother and sister as we look at this and say well Lord why me well that's really actually a very valid question because God's going to allow your Humanity to remain your Humanity he's not taking your Humanity from you and it's there as the Apostle Paul said I have this thorn in my f flesh lest I would boast be exalted so what's the Apostle Paul telling us without the thorn that's it he would exalt himself oh come on are We any humans here tonight amen I'll tell you it's there I think the preachers would would would definitely relate to this there's times God's allow you to be somewhere you preach something something Supernatural happens somebody gets delivered somebody gets healed and and you know and without the thorn of our flesh we would actually think we're something but God says I'll remind you that it's not you it's me in you amen and the only reason you're a vessel of honor is cuz I washed you amen amen amen and so then the mystery continues to be revealed in you and I amen now we look at the nature of a man I kind of phrase these these words here looking at retrospec at myself the nature of man a man labors when he should wait yeah and he waits when he should labor right amen you see we we never quite can get it right I can only imagine what it would have been like if we were allowed to see a very clear picture of the Apostle Paul we look at that and we just have such a vision of the Apostle Paul and truly we should he was God's vessel for the day and Supernatural but my brother and sister we' to went wait what are you doing Paul and Paul would be saying well I don't know I don't know if God wants me to come or go so I'm going to just go sew some tents Y and God's like you should have been packing Paul going over here but you see that's the nature of humanity and as we look at this we struggle with this because how many times I'm setting you up for something I'll just be honest okay I'm setting you up for something but look we labor when we should be trusting God and then the time comes that God says I'm going to perform this and we're going to just sit here and say I'm going to trust God and we should actually be in action that's right TR I messed up last time I went when I should have stayed now I'm going to stay even though God's saying go that's the nature of humanity we're we're out of time we're out of SN with God and Isaiah 55: 6-9 seek ye the Lord while he may be found call ye upon him while he is near let the wicked forsake his way and the unrighteous man his thoughts and let him return unto the Lord and He will have mercy upon him look at this the wicked turning back to the Lord and the word is promising God will have mercy on that man I'm telling you that's a supernatural thing that's right and to our God for he will abundantly pardon amen for my thoughts are not your thoughts boy how that is drilled home in the word my thoughts are not your thoughts neither are your ways my ways saith the Lord this could leave us in a great Paradox where we're not sure what we should do uh you know waiting now I don't say this lightly I don't say it demeaning but I've heard many people that had obvious issues in their lives their marriage their children and they would say you know what I'm just waiting on the lord well that's wonderful why don't you wait on your knees amen not not you know with a mocha I don't think any of you drink those that's why I chose it I'm pointing to myself but you see we're waiting on the Lord while we're doing our thing and God God say you know your way of doing it it's not my way of doing it the way I want you to wait on me is to wait on me in my word wait on me in my presence wait on me in this life I've called you to not just your life not your idea of what waiting on the Lord is amen for my thoughts are not your thoughts neither are your ways my ways sayith the Lord for as the heavens are higher than the earth so are my ways higher than your ways and my thoughts than your thoughts oh my brother and sister I want to ask you within this Vision or make a statement I guess within this Vision that the Lord is releasing through the open word there is Victory amen every bit of this message as we call it amen and I just frame it that way my brother and sister not not casting shadow that as we call it the message my brother and sister everything within that message do I believe every word brother Bram said was perfect well you know that's such a complex thing people getting whole arguments uh you know go out behind the church and Slug It Out so every word he said is perfect and I'll tell you what I actually have come to the Revelation every word he said is perfect it was perfect to God's will at that time that what was spoken the prophet didn't go out here on some kind of thing going out here into Neverland but you see God said it's perfect in this moment and now I'm taking you my brother and sister he didn't say hey look to the serpent and live and then look to the serpent and cross Jordan the serpent was perfect in its season and the prophet's words were spoken perfect in their season it was a coming out leading us to a crossing over to an entering in amen and the word had to be perfect for this season that we are in amen and so as we move forward we realize there wasn't a time I I've shared this to the church first time I heard amen a brother preach on the on the third poll I was like what in the world is he talking about Amen brother Harold hilderbrandt preaching right over there in the little church in Star doesn't even exist anymore and brother Harold preaching on on the third poll and I I'm just writing a note third pole with a big check mark like what is this but did you know God in his grace and mercy everything I picked up or listened to after that was third pole third pole third pole and I realized that was God in a season took me now let's not look at the prophet's message here but took me from a time that this was relevant everything the prophet was saying relevant you were him in him before the foundation of the world and that come in a right season for me and I latched on to that and my fears and my doubts that I was not even called started to Vapor away because I realized it wasn't yesterday it wasn't at that Altar and I was here at that altar but I made a mistake afterwards what do I do but to wake up and realize I'm a Son of God from before the foundation of the world and the third poll my brother and sister it wasn't based on when I saw it or it was revealed to me but God revealed it to me in that season amen amen and in that season I had a growth spurt amen amen that's right now this might not mean much to a farmer to anybody but a farmer but you know when you have corn about knee high and you're going to run now sorry about terminology but you're going to run a dammer Dyer through that and put little pockets in the soil to hold the water so it doesn't run off sometimes I think we as Christians need a dam or Dy or ran over us that the water of the word wouldn't just run off yeah but you know when you open that ground up you better be done because the combination of the disturbing of the soil the sunlight and oxygen within days corn it's taken weeks to grow this tall and when within days it will be this tall every year sister Jerry and I hope you catch the correlation of what I'm trying to express it's in the disturbing of our present condition that's it that's it and every year sister Jerry and I we have our little our little tradition as it were and we're standing out there and and you know it's June 25th and we're like man this Corn's not going to be like it was last year Fourth of July every year we're shooting for corn that's at least as tall as I am if not taller we love to boast our picture you know we love to you know anyway but here's this corn and you think it's not going to do it but the element amen the promise of the revealed word amen that's right every seed must bring forth of its own kind amen and in the disturbing of the soil it starts an action exactly that corn goes from knee high that's it to head high Y to beyond the touch of your fingers high in a very brief time this what God's wanting to do in our lives my brother and sister not us to sit here and say I've been a message believer my whole life and I don't see it no God wants to disturb us he wants to upheave us he wants to do this and give us a little spiritual oxygen that we would then have a growth spurt amen so the the vision the Lord's releasing through the open word there is Victory I want to be redundant about repeating that again you've chosen now brother brandham has uh uh come and and you know Victor Leo and the whole story brother brandham shares and the whole Prophecy of the speaking in tongues and and it's there that he's told because you have chosen the harder way yeah now I I don't I got to say this correctly because we don't want the devil to to discourage anyone but I'm telling you my brother and sister I thank God you chose the harder way yeah because you see what happens is is the easier way is a compromise yes sir the easier way is not the full word and and the Lord was encouraging brother brandham by these words uh spoken over him spoken in tongues and and he tells him you know there's going to be a great victory in love divine because you have chosen this direction these this this path you have chosen this harder way and I I hope you don't mind me just taking this Liberty but you see those words were spoken to brother brandom first fruits have you done your first fruits study yeah abolutely first fruits yes sir spoken over the prophet amen he's talking about you're going to receive a tremendous reward yes sir amen thank you and the message to the bride was stay with the word stand on the word don't compromise on the word move forward in the word trust God yes is that the easy way no it's the harder way now my brother and sister if God gave a prophet an open blessing for choosing the harder way that he would reward him what's God going to do for you and I right amen we're not going to stand here and say oh we're we're equal we're this or that but that was an outpouring of Prophecy that was given to the prophet and the prophet preached that word and that word is going to have the same exact effect upon the bride of Christ and she is going to have a tremendous blessing in love divine a victory in love divine because she has chosen to walk the harder way she didn't quit she didn't compromise she didn't say oh if God would just make this simpler I could continue on what he does is gives you the strength to stand in the battle and then blesses you for standing in the battle Hallelujah that's right are we doing okay that's right amen I believe it is a victory that was spoken you know Satan hates truth yes he does man I tell you he hates truth so bad he just desires to destroy it any way he can amen but did you know that whatever Satan stumbles you with that'll be the way I'll put it whatever Satan stumbles you with today and the prophet of God said when when the holy spirit moves upon you and you realize you've done wrong you repent right then amen don't push it down the road just simply and now repentance is so easy that we we can't hardly accept it exactly so easy yeah Lord I'm sorry instead we got to go crawl up the steps on our knees till they bleed and we've got to repeat hundreds of prayers and we've got to this and that and cower before God but that's not what the word showed us not what the prophet taught us so as you look at this we realize that Satan's still trying to fight Truth by inserting a certain element of tradition and we know what Jesus said about them men following their Traditions amen so what we got to do is just come to the place that you actually now bear with me if this doesn't come out quite right but I know it's right how's that for Eric I know it's right when Satan's fighting the truth in you with you just thank the Lord amen not a big deep thing that you've got to go into a ritual stop and thank the Lord Lord I Thank You For Truth I thank you for the word I thank you for the life I thank you for the way I thank you Lord but we've got a ritual I've got to oh I've got to do this I got to show God that that I'm truly sorry he knows your heart he knows what he's placed in you and what he placed in you was not defective and it was not insufficient trust God and say thank you Lord that you have given me the way the truth and the life right amen and then thank the Lord that he chose you to stay in the fight that's right hallelujah amen I'm telling you my brother and sister your witness you see I'm fixing to read a quote to you in just a minute but you see God only deals in Witnesses amen he's not into Theory no he's not into theology except when he is because when you understand what theology actually is Anointed with the Holy Ghost we study we read we comprehend but it's got to be anointed by the Holy Ghost word says you can't even say Jesus is the Christ without the Holy Ghost but I'll tell you within the last few days or hours many people have declared that Jesus is the Christ repeating the words by rot is not what God's looking for he's looking for a people that can say Jesus is the Christ with Revelation with understanding with anointing with the life that is spoken out of that and your you're prophesying yourself into your position amen amen that's exactly what it but not just just words anyone can repeat the words right you see God's looking for Witnesses of the real experience and you don't have to have a man speaking tongues over you no how much of the world today they're there pounding them on the back oh just speak in tongues just speak in tongues that's not what God called us that's just speak in tongues just believe that's right maybe maybe we need an element where we'll pound him on the back brother just believe but you see The Human Side likes this then we can go forth and say I had a supernatural event well I'm telling you when you can stand in the midst of leod DEA and stand on the word not back up stay in the fight and say I believe that is Supernatural amen we've come so common on this oh yeah yeah that's just that I'm telling you the devil my brother and sister it would ter ify you and I if we actually saw what Satan is stacked up against you and yet you still live amen right exactly right amen and the reason you don't need someone speaking tongues over you is because your eyes and your ears are open amen therefore the word says you're blessed prise the Lord yeah that's something to say Thank You Lord thank you Lord you see our Lord spoke this is this is the beautiful part my brother and sister the Lord spoke and we heard amen but not only did we hear we acted amen upon what we heard too many people can quote the message to you exactly forwards backwards tell you I met Brothers a good men I'm not I'm not saying nothing ill against them but I met brothers so smart that you start to say something and they'll tell you what message it is what paragraph it is and what page that paragraph is on and I'm just standing there going uh-huh uh-huh have no idea but you see there's one thing I do know yeah it's God's blessed me know him to know him that's exactly right amen that's right now I want to get into this quote which will finish up our service tonight it's only about seemingly a page or two long a personal experience with God I don't know if any of you have listened to that recently but it is pretty awesome sermon and that's the way it is when we go to talk about God let's get somebody who's got an experience who knows what they're speaking of and these Apostles had had the experience of Pentecost they were blessed they had Divine Joy now you see what separates that a lot of people have joy but to have a Divine Joy is a joy that came from God down in your heart not just happy person and their hearts were all bubbling over the whole world belonged to them and isn't it too bad we have lost that Joy tonight that Divine joy and what they once had and then I think of how that the world needs the experience that they had at that time now we think of Moses when Moses in a burning bush this sheep herder think about this divinely protected in Egypt floats in the Nile in an area clear full of crocodiles is fetched out taken into the palace you see other than what God deposited him his teaching came out of an Egyptian Palace that's right what's our excuse yeah this sheep H herder one morning walking along Old path where he had walked many times and there he was attracted by a burning bush just just like any of us would be come to find out the angel of the Lord was in this bush and now he speaks to Moses Moses had been a bitter failure amen I'd like to ask those tonight and those listening would you look at your life as a bitter failure it's pretty harsh self judg judement to declare my life is a failure I know some guys today in fact I know some sisters also today that would have told you before the Lord saved them and Drew them out they were a bitter failure wonder what the woman at the well actually thought about her life what did Ray think in the Midnight Hour when she was alone how did I end up here and now speaks to Moses Moses had been a bitter failure for yet knowing that God was going to deliver the children of Israel by him and if this hurts just go ahead and say ouch out loud if you want to yet knowing that God was going to deliver the children of Israel by him yet trying to do it within himself 40 years before that yes sir you now have a little better understanding what Moses carried with him when he told God I can't do this this you need to find somebody more qualified 40 Years of caring the fact I killed a man because I thought I was going to deliver Israel I was the chosen man my way is going to work oh my brother and sister I think a lot of us would have to admit we maybe didn't go 40 years but we've been trying to do it ourself we've been holding on to our ideas of what the message meant and what it called us to do and I'll tell you what let me just forgive me if this is a little harsh but I'll tell you I see the evidence of that when I see people message Believers going everywhere they go judging everyone they come next to as though they were God and I'll tell you tonight I'm glad they are not God because they would have sent me to hell when God said you're my son amen so here's man in his approach say this is what I need to do to further the message to cleanse the message to purify yeah come on my brother and sister God did not call us to be the judge he said he would be the judge and we'll even show up at the white Throne judgment and we will stand there as judges but really what the word is declaring we'll stand there as witnesses to what the judge said it will be that's right amen not us saying you in you out you done you're finished you're no my brother and sister what will we testify at the white Throne judgment the word in me allowed me to overcome that and you had the same opportunity to let the word in you to overcome that that will be the testimony it won't be oh praise God no my brother and sister you see God has his plan let's line up with the plan hallelujah amen amen let's move on here had become a failure had lost all the vision of [Music] Victory I've been around the block a couple times my brother and sister one of the things is slipping into the message they're losing the vision amen of Victory that's exactly right now brother Bram hits it here lost all the vision of VI Victory and freedom for the people enslaved and I just wonder sometimes if we the church knowing that God has promised to deliver the church from its sin and from his sickness and to make us a people a salty people he doesn't say here A Perfect People my brother and sister he doesn't say the shining example a Pharisee of the message of the 21st century he says a salty person thank you Jesus that the Earth will hunger and thirst after and I wonder in our human efforts in our theologies and so forth and our great fine buildings so forth that as we tried to present to the people many years ago we found that it had failed and because we took it in ourselves to do so we took it upon ourselves to have new schools to educate our ministers and so forth we left off the real principle the real thing that God told us to receive was to let the Holy Spirit lead the church amen my I I actually breathe a sigh of relief I do not have to come here and guide this little church on my own Merit my own intellect my own ability what we got to do is come and say Lord I'm here to serve you I'm here to let you lead me and guide me I'm here to let you give me strength and in my time of weakness may you be made strong am amen and then people will say look the pastor is no more spiritual than we are praise God he's no more spiritual than you are you're the bride of Christ amen but it's Christ in us it's Christ in us moving us forward was to let the Holy Spirit lead the church we've left that off and as we've lost left lost our divine Joy the vision is dull now [Music] amen some people wouldn't be happy at all to hear this preached to them in a message Church your vision is getting dull H now those are the prophet's words not mine are we good enough to go on people are not looking for the coming of the Lord and yet atomic bombs hanging in the hangers everywhere and the things that would destroy the world at once but people has lost their vision of the Lord because they have set times amen that the Lord would come at a certain time and they've done these all these things trying to do it with in themselves we must turn loose and let God do these things how can we do those things without the Holy Spirit and now Moses had been a bitter failure but out there now we see his attention attracted to a burning bush he looks through the burning bush to find out what the trouble was and walking close to it fire usually brings an attraction usually the Holy Spirit when it comes in a manner of fire attracts the attention of the people and when Moses turned aside to consider this Burning Tree that would not burn up God spoke to him a fresh Vision that's right oh I lift my hand tonight I don't know if you would but Lord I want a fresh Vision amen come Speak to My Heart Lord we have trouble here we have trouble there amen I'm not speaking of anything in particular but kind of particular travel across the country we get a preach for a church wonderful time in the Lord there's trouble in that church that's right amen there's trouble here there's trouble there there's trouble everywhere my brother and sister and if we're not careful we become weary and well-doing and our vision is there's always trouble Lord Deliver Us from the trouble how about Lord Deliver us from our vision amen hallelujah amen things that would destroy people lost their Vision because they' have set times the word would come at a certain time I can tell you about a half a dozen different times through the years the Lord is coming at this place on this morning at this time and we watch people sell houses businesses and and all kinds of things children not serving God they just like too bad you missed it y well I'll tell you what as long as there's breath in this body I'll claim my children children amen amen there'll be none of this well too bad I guess they missed it I'm going to fight for them amen amen it's not just cuz they're my kin I will fight for you and I will fight for your children amen your parents whatever it might be because you see that's the nature of a Believer amen amen amen fire usually brings attraction usually the Holy Spirit comes in a manner of fire attracts the attention of the people and when Moses turned aside to consider this Burning Tree that would not burn up you know the pillar of fire on the Bride of Jesus Christ has got the same fire amen as it was when it first fell amen we don't have to worry about it burning out what we got to do is keep in it and keep it in US amen it's no weaker today in the very midst of Le oysa the prophet showed us in the church ages the darkest age yeah and the fire is still burning amen sir and we know nothing great Revelation here the darker the night the brighter the light shines hallelujah we're there at brother Danny's and he had a brand new fire pit we had to test it out he told me I had to be part of the test drive and you know he's got a house and a shed and a fence and you know as that fire when it was down inside the fire pit there was hardly anything shown on the fence and the shed and the house but when brother Dany threw a little bit more wood in there and got the fire coming up out of the fire pit suddenly the fence was lit up the wood pile was lit up the shed was lit up the house was lit up you see we got to get enough fire but you know we're afraid of what the Joneses might say M about your wildfire wildfire is no proof but no fire at all is proof Lord help us Lord help us amen now I'm not a naturally just I want to clarify this so you don't mind here we're not quite late yet got one more minute I naturally in myself am not a guy to there's been times I've stood on this plat form and something inside of me I just felt like just running down the church and running around the outside but this flash it's like well what were the people think brother Isaac shut the video off brother Paul feels like dancing come on my brother and sister we are so caught up Amen in our little world what would people think of me what would people think of us what would they think of our church what would God think that should be the only question that we have what will my Lord think amen okay let me get going along here God spoke to him a fresh Vision By An Angel now watch Faith take hold right quick the old things are passed away but Moses now has a new vision he has a revelation he has an experience he had met God he had talked to God before that he had not met God he had only read and knowed what his mother had told him by hearing what his mother has said hearing what the pastor has said but now Moses has a personal experience and that's what the church needs tonight is to just stop studying so much theology come on my brother and sister we've heard it preached we got to study this we got to understand this we got to be able to explain this the prophet of God's countering this right here right now I wouldn't say he's doing away with it but he is putting context to it he's telling us you know what we need to do is put away quit stop studying so much Theology and get down to the Altar and pray until a personal experience burns down into the human heart and burns out all the dullness and gives a new vision I tell you I'm lifting my hand tonight Lord I want a new vision I don't want to be burdened down by the cares of this life and the troubles and the things you know how it is you know you you get a little older and and suddenly things that when you're young you just ignored them it'll take care of itself now we're going to try and fix it and that's a very bad disease for a pastor cuz instead of letting the Lord have control that's it in the church that's right he as a pastor tries to fix it that's right and it's strange they Boomerang and it gets worse y right because it's got the hand of man amen on it amen hallelujah look let me just talking about theology we need to know what we believe we got no excuse not to know what we believe amen but we need to know the author more I love how they said well brother Brown you don't know your Bible very well said I know the author yeah that's right and the author will reveal to us what's in the book that's right amen so don't put so much into knowing uh all these things we believe and put more into knowing the author that's right amen as the song says Lord be thou my vision amen hallelujah I think we'll stop right there sister Ruth if you would come Hallelujah just a few more scribbles here but I think we've made our Point Hallelujah don't you want a fresh Vision that's right I say Lord let us have a fresh Vision Amen Let It Come Down where's the where's the revival going to start in Grace Tabernacle right here right here amen why don't we start a Revival amen amen let's not just talk about it why don't we start a Revival amen we know we let can I be bold please we know we need it yeah that's right we know we need a closer walk with the Lord we talk about it yeah and then we go right back status quo help us Lord help us to know you better that's right to know you more Amen to have you reveal yourself to us we got children that need the Holy Ghost amen we've got uh people situations that need deliverance we need healing in our midst we got a choice we can sit back and say I hope it happens or we can take the word of God and say Lord we will come before your throne boldly and see your word fulfilled that's my heart's desire saints that we would start a Revival Lord let it start with me amen hallelujah let's just stand and sing amen invite my brother Isaac if you would let's sing 93 don't lose your vision of Jesus we can have a vision of the message and not have a vision of Jesus Christ we can under understand everything the scripture said
