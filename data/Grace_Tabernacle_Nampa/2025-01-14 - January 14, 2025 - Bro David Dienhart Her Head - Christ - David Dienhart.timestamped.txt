[8:13] God bless you this evening. Amen. Good
[8:16] to be here.
[8:20] Amen.
[8:22] Amen. I'd just like to start with number
[8:24] 661. Victory in Jesus.
[8:31] I heard an old old story.
[8:35] How a savior came from glory.
[8:40] How he gave his life on Calvary
[8:44] to save a wretch like me.
[8:49] I heard about his groaning
[8:53] of his precious blood atoning.
[8:58] Then I repented of my sin and won the
[9:04] victory.
[9:07] Oh victory
[9:09] in Jesus
[9:11] my savior
[9:14] forever.
[9:16] He sought me and he bought me with his
[9:22] redeeing blood.
[9:25] He loved me where I knew him and all my
[9:31] love is due him. He plunged me to
[9:37] victory
[9:38] beneath the cleansing flood.
[9:43] I heard about his healing
[9:47] of his cleansing power revealing
[9:52] how he made the lame to walk again. And
[9:57] he caused the blind to see.
[10:01] And then I cried, "Dear Jesus,
[10:05] come and heal my broken
[10:08] spirit."
[10:10] And somehow Jesus came and brought to me
[10:16] the victory.
[10:19] Oh victory
[10:21] in Jesus
[10:24] my savior
[10:26] forever.
[10:28] He sought me and he bought me with his
[10:34] redeeing blood.
[10:37] He loved me as I knew him. And all my
[10:43] love is due to him. He plunged me to
[10:49] victory
[10:51] beneath the cleansing flood.
[10:56] I heard about a mansion
[11:00] he has built for me in glory.
[11:05] And I heard about the streets of gold
[11:09] beyond the crystal sea
[11:14] about the angels
[11:16] singing
[11:18] and the old redemption
[11:21] story.
[11:23] And some sweet day I'll sing up there a
[11:28] song of victory.
[11:32] Oh, victory
[11:34] in Jesus
[11:36] my savior
[11:38] forever.
[11:40] He sought me and he bought me with his
[11:46] redeeing blood.
[11:49] He loved me and I knew him and all my
[11:55] love is to him.
[11:59] He plunged me to victory
[12:03] beneath the cleansing flow.
[12:09] Amen.
[12:12] Amen. Number 144.
[12:25] What
[12:28] name the name of Jesus
[12:35] reaching higher far
[12:39] than the brightest star.

[12:48] than the songs they sing in heaven.
[12:54] Let the saints proclaim
[12:59] what a lovely name.
[13:06] Soon
[13:07] he'll come in. Clouds of gloryy.

[13:19] shall behold his face.

[13:27] him enter heaven city

[21:39] The trial of this world was getting
[21:45] closer.
[21:50] The pole I felt was more than I could
[21:56] bear.
[22:02] And I was on the verge
[22:07] of giving over
[22:12] the
[22:14] strength I within myself
[22:18] just wasn't there.
[22:24] Something keeps holding me

[23:07] me.
[23:14] Satan laid before me
[23:18] his temptation
[23:24] of
[23:25] his desire to steal away my faith.
[23:37] But I have found inside
[23:41] the revelation,
[23:47] the strength I need to keep me in his
[23:55] grave.
[23:59] Something keeps holding me
[24:06] every day. I see

[40:10] And I'm speaking of the bride, the
[40:12] bride's head, Christ. She has one head,
[40:17] &gt;&gt; only one head.
[40:21] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[40:23] Amen. She's not a double-minded bride.
[40:28] &gt;&gt; Amen. She can't be married to two heads
[40:30] at one time. If she is, she's an
[40:32] adulteress.
[40:34] You can't be double-minded.
[40:37] Amen. You can't be divided in opinion.
[40:41] Amen. You can't you can't be divided
[40:43] over here and married to this and

[40:51] bride here tonight?
[40:51] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[40:52] &gt;&gt; Amen. And we're talking to the bride.
[40:55] Amen. So, Ephesians chapter 1 verse 22.
[40:59] And hath put all things
[41:02] under his feet. That's his body. Notice
[41:06] who he put it under. He put all things
[41:09] under his feet.
[41:13] and gave him him. Who is he? And gave
[41:17] him here's the answer.
[41:20] Gave him to be the head
[41:24] over all things to the church.
[41:28] Who's the church? The separated ones.
[41:31] The body of Christ. That's the church.
[41:34] Now watch verse 23. Which is his body.
[41:37] The church is his body. He's he's he's
[41:41] the head of the body, which is his body,
[41:43] and the body is the fullness of him.
[41:46] She's the finished mystery of Christ.
[41:50] &gt;&gt; She's the message of this hour.
[41:51] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[41:52] &gt;&gt; She is the open book.
[41:54] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[41:56] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[41:57] &gt;&gt; When the book opened, it was revealing
[41:59] the bride. It was revealing you. It was
[42:01] unfolding, unveiling his thought that
[42:04] you were his eternal thought before the
[42:06] foundation of the world. Until this book
[42:08] was opened, we couldn't be qui awakened.
[42:10] But when this book opened, we've
[42:12] awakened.
[42:14] &gt;&gt; Amen. And now being awakened,
[42:17] remember prophet said it took those
[42:19] seven thunders to awaken her.
[42:21] &gt;&gt; Amen. That which is the mystery of the
[42:24] seventh seal. It took those seven
[42:26] thunders to awaken her.
[42:29] &gt;&gt; And then a year later, he says, and he
[42:32] said, they have not recognized.
[42:35] They're calling for revival. They're
[42:36] calling for revival and have not
[42:38] recognized the awakening of the bride.
[42:41] And there we're 63 years later. Is there
[42:44] a bride awakened?
[42:46] &gt;&gt; Absolutely.
[42:48] I can say personally by revelation and
[42:50] you ought to too. I was in his mind
[42:52] existing. I was I was I was alive and
[42:55] real in his thoughts and was ordained to
[42:57] be here in this hour.
[42:59] &gt;&gt; Amen. And always was his eternal
[43:02] possession.
[43:03] &gt;&gt; Amen. And it took the opening of the
[43:05] book. It took the opening of the word
[43:07] for me to realize it.
[43:09] &gt;&gt; But I always to that I always was. It
[43:12] wasn't based on my works. It's based on
[43:14] his his his
[43:17] grace and his his um purpose.
[43:22] Amen. That he purposed in himself.
[43:25] Hallelujah.
[43:26] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[43:26] &gt;&gt; That ought to make me shout amen. And we
[43:28] could go home right now. That's good
[43:30] enough for me.
[43:31] &gt;&gt; Amen. We never did the thing to merit
[43:33] it. He gave you an ear to hear. You had
[43:36] a listening post already put inside of
[43:38] you. And when the word come forth, you
[43:41] were able to discern the word.
[43:43] &gt;&gt; Not many can discern the word in this
[43:45] hour, but there's a bride that has
[43:47] discernment.
[43:49] &gt;&gt; Because she has the mind of Christ.
[43:52] Heavenly Father, I'm asking you to bless
[43:55] your word tonight. I'm asking you, Lord,
[43:58] to have your way with every individual
[43:59] heart. And Lord, open my mouth, Lord.
[44:03] And and speak the words of life because
[44:05] Lord, the life is in the body. The
[44:09] opened word is in the body, Lord. And we
[44:12] realize that we always were your
[44:14] thoughts expressed in a word. And
[44:17] Father, we are that spoken word seed,
[44:21] which is what you've sent in our time
[44:23] and our day to to to to show us the way.
[44:27] We've received the perfect
[44:29] interpretation of your word by divine
[44:31] vindication
[44:33] and that which is perfect has come. And
[44:36] Lord, we're we're gloring in that
[44:38] perfect. And we thank you for the
[44:40] perfect ministry of yourself that has
[44:42] been opened and has been spoken as you
[44:45] said it would be in our day with a with
[44:47] a with a with by you yourself
[44:51] coming down in a simple man and holding
[44:54] that sword. He said, "It fit my hand."
[44:56] And by the word, we've come to the
[44:58] realization of who we are. We give you
[45:00] praise. We give you thanks. And it's our
[45:03] victory because you are our victory. And
[45:05] that victory is revealed in us. And we
[45:07] have become your victory in Jesus name.
[45:11] Amen. Amen. You may be seated.
[45:15] Colossians chapter 1
[45:20] verse 18. Very familiar, similar verse.
[45:27] And he is the head of the body.
[45:31] Everybody understands that. Pretty easy
[45:33] to understand. He is the head of the
[45:34] body. Who's the body? The flesh and bone
[45:38] of him. Brother Bram said the body. The
[45:41] bride will be the flesh and bone of
[45:43] Christ.
[45:45] &gt;&gt; Amen. He said that's the bride.
[45:49] And so so she's the flesh and bone of
[45:51] him. And he is the head of the body, the
[45:54] church. Who is the beginning? Who is the
[45:57] beginning? The firstborn from the dead.
[46:01] Oh, hallelujah. Aren't you glad the
[46:02] death seal is broken?
[46:05] &gt;&gt; Aren't you glad? Aren't you glad that
[46:07] the death you've passed from death unto
[46:09] life? I'm so thankful that I can say by
[46:12] revelation, and this is how the bride
[46:14] lives in this hour, by revelation, that
[46:16] we can say I've passed from death to
[46:18] life. I can say that I died with him.
[46:21] Paid the penalty of sin in his body and
[46:23] raised up victorious over death, hell,
[46:25] and the grave.
[46:27] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. I couldn't be something
[46:30] different than I was in him before the
[46:32] foundation of the world. I have to come
[46:33] in my season to manifest that word.
[46:37] &gt;&gt; Amen. Praise be to God. We have one
[46:39] head. And the bride only follows one
[46:42] head. And she's married to one head.
[46:45] &gt;&gt; She has no other preeminence. Her
[46:47] preeminence is one head.
[46:50] &gt;&gt; Amen. And so he that this goes right on.
[46:53] Who is the beginning the firstborn from
[46:54] the dead that in all things in all
[46:58] things all things he might have the
[47:02] preeminence.
[47:04] Praise be to God. Are you willing to
[47:06] give him the preeminence? You know what
[47:07] preeminence means? The oversight
[47:10] to every little even to every every move
[47:13] you make. Seek ye first the kingdom of
[47:16] God, and all these other things shall be
[47:18] added unto you. Just let him be first.
[47:20] Seek him first. Where is the kingdom of
[47:22] God? It's in the people. It's in the
[47:24] bride. The word made alive, made life in
[47:27] you, is the kingdom of God.
[47:29] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[47:30] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. And that is alive and well.
[47:34] Amen. Amen. Seek that first.
[47:37] &gt;&gt; Amen. and all these other things that
[47:39] you're so anxious about and can't figure
[47:41] out and why it is. He said, "I'll I'll
[47:43] I'll give it to you." Amen. Amen. All
[47:47] these other things will be added.
[47:50] &gt;&gt; Praise be to God.
[47:52] Amen. All that the word ever said about
[47:54] you will be finished and done. Praise
[47:57] the Lord. All right. I'd like you to go
[48:00] with me now. So, what are we doing? What
[48:02] are we doing here? We're we ought to be
[48:04] giving up all
[48:07] &gt;&gt; to one head because he is the head
[48:12] in all things. The firstborn from the
[48:15] dead that in all things.
[48:19] All things. Why not give him all things?
[48:21] Then let's give him everything.
[48:24] Amen. Let's lay our veil. We said here
[48:27] the last time we spoke, lay our veil on
[48:29] his shoulders. You're married to him.
[48:31] He's your head. You have no other head.
[48:35] Amen. You're dependent upon him. We
[48:37] ought to be dependent. Not independent,
[48:39] but dependent
[48:41] &gt;&gt; upon him in all things.
[48:44] &gt;&gt; He has the preeminence.
[48:47] Are you willing to give him all things?
[48:51] We don't have brother sister. The bride
[48:53] is not a girlfriend boyfriend
[48:55] relationship.
[48:57] &gt;&gt; The bride is his wife. Amen.
[49:01] &gt;&gt; And he goes home with her. He governs
[49:03] the finances that you have. He does
[49:06] everything that a head would do. Amen.
[49:10] And if he gives it for you to do, fine.
[49:12] But he's given it to you. He leads you.
[49:15] He guides you. You're led by him. It's
[49:17] not I had my time with him. Bless God. I
[49:20] was in church and go home and live
[49:21] another life.
[49:24] &gt;&gt; No, you're not. It's not a boyfriend
[49:25] girlfriend relationship.
[49:28] It's a one relationship. one head.
[49:30] You're married to one head.
[49:32] &gt;&gt; The marriage, how many know the marriage
[49:33] has come? The union is now, not at the
[49:36] wedding supper.
[49:37] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[49:38] &gt;&gt; We have the union now.
[49:40] &gt;&gt; We're in union with him now.
[49:42] &gt;&gt; We go to the wedding supper to celebrate
[49:44] a union.
[49:46] &gt;&gt; Is that right? We're going to sit down
[49:48] at that table.
[49:49] &gt;&gt; You believe that?
[49:51] &gt;&gt; Absolutely.
[49:53] Amen. All right. And we're right here at
[49:56] that door right now.
[49:59] Amen. We're right here. We're ready.
[50:01] Maybe the next before we leave this
[50:03] building. I don't know when we're going
[50:04] to meet those loved ones, but they're
[50:06] going to be there.
[50:07] &gt;&gt; Amen. They're going to resurrect. And at
[50:09] the same time they resurrected, we
[50:10] expect an earthquake at the
[50:12] resurrection.
[50:13] &gt;&gt; Amen. Because when Christ arose, there
[50:16] was an earthquake.
[50:18] &gt;&gt; Is that right?
[50:19] &gt;&gt; And frankly, we've already we've had a
[50:21] great earthquake already happened. I
[50:23] mean, the earth has quaked and broke the
[50:25] seal.
[50:27] &gt;&gt; Amen. that thundered out. That's right.
[50:30] Amen. But we know we know that when that
[50:33] earthquake in in I don't know why I'm
[50:35] getting on this, but we know that
[50:36] earthquake in Alaska 1964, Brother
[50:39] Brandham said he was officially put out
[50:41] of the church. He was officially
[50:43] crucified. He said that's what that
[50:45] meant. And he said judgment was striking
[50:47] the West Coast. And you can see it.
[50:51] &gt;&gt; Amen. 60 62 years later, we see it.
[50:56] &gt;&gt; Amen. Yeah,
[50:58] &gt;&gt; we see it. We see LA. We see all of that
[51:00] West Coast under judgment. We can see
[51:02] it. It's going everywhere. It's going
[51:04] around the world. Amen. What's it
[51:06] leading up to?
[51:08] Amen. Two witnesses that go to to
[51:11] Israel. But what they waiting for us to
[51:13] get out of the way.
[51:16] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. All right. Now, you talk
[51:19] about the earth being plagued. Wait till
[51:23] those two prophets come on. Not wait. I
[51:25] won't be here. I hope you're with me.
[51:28] I'll be gone. But they're going to have
[51:31] to stand that. And that's And what is it
[51:32] for? It doesn't plague Israel. It
[51:34] plagues those those Gentiles out there,
[51:36] Rome and the rest of them.
[51:38] &gt;&gt; Amen. That's exactly right. Now, I won't
[51:40] get into that's another message, but if
[51:45] you can tell I've been into the fifth
[51:46] and sixth seal, but anyway. Okay. So,
[51:51] so let's give everything to one head.
[51:54] Amen.
[51:54] &gt;&gt; Amen. Second Peter 3:11.
[51:58] And under that,
[52:00] under that understanding,
[52:06] under this that we've read and this that
[52:08] we have under one head
[52:14] get to second Peter here. Okay,
[52:20] let's just take verse 10 with it.
[52:25] But the day of the Lord will come as a
[52:27] thief in the night. We know that. We
[52:29] know it's it's it's already in progress.
[52:31] It's coming already as a thief. They
[52:34] don't know what's happening. The world
[52:36] doesn't know what's happening. Most of
[52:38] most of message people don't know what's
[52:39] happening because God's taken a bride
[52:42] out of that.
[52:45] Not everybody that says, "I believe the
[52:47] message is going to be in the rapture."
[52:50] Did you know that? Everybody that has
[52:52] the revelation of what that message
[52:54] brought will be in the rapture.
[52:59] &gt;&gt; Amen. That's exactly right. All right.
[53:02] So, because the only people that have
[53:04] perfect love, the capstone of perfect
[53:06] love is the bride.
[53:09] &gt;&gt; Amen. A lot of people have felioial
[53:12] love, which is no nothing wrong with
[53:13] that. I have a felio love for my wife.
[53:15] She has for me. It's a human love. Amen.
[53:18] And that's good. That's fine. We need
[53:20] more human love. We need that love.
[53:22] That's part of that's part of the
[53:24] process. But the capstone is perfect.
[53:28] It's agape love. Amen. We grow up into
[53:31] that stature. And that's Christ himself.
[53:34] And that's who the bride is. You
[53:36] remember the scripture said that Christ
[53:39] remember he titled his sermon when he
[53:41] preached the seventh seal he said he
[53:44] said I mean not the seventh seal
[53:46] preaching but the when he when it come
[53:48] to the time for it to be open to the
[53:49] bride Christ the mystery of God revealed
[53:52] that's exactly what it is Christ is the
[53:55] mystery of God revealed then if Christ
[53:57] be in you the mystery is opened in you
[54:00] you want to know what the new birth is
[54:04] the mystery Christ revealed in You
[54:07] &gt;&gt; you are the mystery revealed.
[54:11] &gt;&gt; Amen. Because whatever's in your soul is
[54:14] who you are.
[54:15] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[54:16] &gt;&gt; You're sitting here tonight. Whatever's
[54:17] on the inside of the inside is who you
[54:20] are.
[54:22] &gt;&gt; That is who you are. That identifies
[54:23] you. That's who you are.
[54:25] &gt;&gt; You can have all kinds of sensations and
[54:27] feelings in your spirit,
[54:29] but that spirit, if that word's in the
[54:31] soul, that spirit will come under
[54:33] obedience to that word. And when it
[54:36] comes obedience to that word, what's
[54:39] happening? The word's made flesh in you.
[54:41] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[54:41] &gt;&gt; You remember what the prophet said, the
[54:43] soul controls the spirit.
[54:46] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[54:47] &gt;&gt; Because there's a nature. That soul has
[54:49] a nature.
[54:51] And there's two natures in your body
[54:52] right now. There's a nature of an old
[54:55] man which is battling against you, and
[54:57] there's a nature of eternal life, which
[54:59] is Christ himself.
[55:01] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[55:03] &gt;&gt; How many know that's true? Go back and
[55:05] read communion. That's exactly I'm not
[55:08] speaking of two souls. You only there's
[55:09] only one soul and that's Christ and you.
[55:13] &gt;&gt; Amen. So, so, but there is two natures
[55:16] and and those two natures are there an
[55:19] emnity against one another.
[55:21] &gt;&gt; But greater is he that is in you than he
[55:24] that is in the world. Amen. Is that
[55:27] right?
[55:28] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[55:30] All right. So, second Peter 3:11 says
[55:33] this. He said, "But that the day of the
[55:36] Lord will come as a thief in the night,
[55:37] in which the heavens shall pass away
[55:39] with a great noise, and the elements
[55:41] shall melt with fervent heat, the earth
[55:44] also, and the works that are therein
[55:45] shall be burned up." You say, "Oh,
[55:46] brother David, how can you say?" I said,
[55:49] "It's coming as a thief."
[55:52] We We haven't come to that point yet. A
[55:54] lot of it around us, you may think it
[55:57] has, but it's coming to that place. We
[56:00] know that. But it does but it's not just
[56:02] an overnight thing. It's it's a progress
[56:05] of coming to that. But how does he come
[56:07] to that as a thief?
[56:10] Amen. What's he got to do first? Take us
[56:12] out of here.
[56:14] Remember he said his coming to us. His
[56:16] coming to he's coming to take the bride
[56:19] would be as a thief.
[56:21] He gets up at the ladder up in the
[56:23] nighttime when nobody no public around
[56:25] and he knocks on the window of of uh
[56:28] Romeo or Juliet and says
[56:31] come.
[56:33] We just read it. We just sang it. Come
[56:35] away.
[56:37] The spirit and the bride say come. What
[56:40] do they ask you to come to? Come to
[56:43] yourself. Come to your position.
[56:46] &gt;&gt; The ministry of the word is telling you
[56:48] your position that always was. You just
[56:50] need to recognize it.
[56:53] &gt;&gt; You're his word. You're his word living
[56:56] and you're his word in action. You are
[56:58] his faith.
[57:00] Other words, you the believer, the bride
[57:03] is the the substance, the revelation of
[57:07] God.
[57:09] The bride is paragraph 68 of perfect
[57:11] faith. The bride is the believer is the
[57:14] faith of God moving in you.
[57:17] What is that faith of God? That is
[57:20] perfect faith. It's God's own faith. And
[57:23] that's your identification.
[57:25] And faith is a revelation. And so you
[57:28] are the believer is the substance of God
[57:33] expressed right here in in your body, in
[57:35] my body, in a many membered body.
[57:38] &gt;&gt; Amen. With with different ministrations
[57:41] of that one head.
[57:43] &gt;&gt; Don't try to be somebody else. You just
[57:45] be yourself.
[57:47] &gt;&gt; Amen. But be sure you know.
[57:51] If you don't know, you need to know
[57:53] you're born again.
[57:54] &gt;&gt; Because when you're born again, you know
[57:56] it.
[57:59] &gt;&gt; Amen. You know it because it'll identify
[58:02] itself with the word. It can't leave
[58:04] that word. It will identify itself
[58:07] because it was the thought of God to
[58:08] begin with and here to be manifest. And
[58:10] he put his thought in the word. Amen.
[58:14] And so we believe every everything in
[58:16] this Bible. Amen. Is that right? I don't
[58:20] hear an amen.
[58:21] &gt;&gt; You believe everything here.
[58:23] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[58:24] &gt;&gt; That's right. But there's a thought
[58:26] behind this.
[58:28] &gt;&gt; Amen. Paul said, "We don't minister the
[58:30] letter. We minister the spirit."
[58:32] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[58:33] &gt;&gt; We are not ministers of the letter.
[58:35] Everybody has the letter, but we're
[58:38] ministers of the thought that's behind
[58:39] this letter.
[58:41] &gt;&gt; Amen. That's the spirit of what this
[58:43] that's why he said we read between the
[58:45] lines. We're able to discern what he's
[58:47] saying between the lines. It was a
[58:49] letter sent to us. But the ministry is
[58:52] the thought expressed.
[58:56] &gt;&gt; Amen. And we are that thought expressed.
[59:01] &gt;&gt; That's what makes the bride such a
[59:02] mystic. That's what makes her peculiar.
[59:04] That's what makes her odd.
[59:07] &gt;&gt; Because she's in a direct relationship.
[59:09] She's in a love relationship with God
[59:11] himself,
[59:12] &gt;&gt; with Jesus Christ himself. And she's
[59:15] entered into the place of worship. She
[59:17] has no desire to leave.
[59:19] &gt;&gt; There's one place of worship and that's
[59:21] in Christ. And you cannot worship him
[59:24] except you be in Christ. You cannot call
[59:26] Jesus the Lord owner, your your head
[59:31] without having the Holy Spirit saying
[59:33] that within you.
[59:34] &gt;&gt; Right?
[59:39] All right.
[59:40] So, second Peter, I haven't got to verse
[59:43] 11. Okay. Now, seeing then after seeing
[59:46] what he's doing, how he's coming, what's
[59:48] going to happen, seeing then that all
[59:50] these things shall be dissolved,
[59:54] what manner of person
[59:58] ought we to be? There you are. What
[1:00:02] manner of person ought we to be in all
[1:00:05] holy conversation? That's manner of
[1:00:08] living. Conversation is a manner of
[1:00:10] living. It's your manner of living. What
[1:00:12] manner of people ought we to be in all
[1:00:14] are living in action and deed. Amen.
[1:00:16] What manner of people ought we to be
[1:00:18] seeing these things will be dissolved.
[1:00:20] What manner of people ought we to be
[1:00:22] when we see our head is the word.
[1:00:25] Amen. You can't make you cannot you
[1:00:28] cannot direct your way. Did you know
[1:00:32] that?
[1:00:33] &gt;&gt; Every one of us in here cannot direct
[1:00:35] his own steps.
[1:00:37] &gt;&gt; You cannot direct your own way. You
[1:00:39] can't lead yourself.
[1:00:42] &gt;&gt; You're incapable of leading yourself.
[1:00:45] It's either God or Satan leading you.
[1:00:50] &gt;&gt; It comes down to there's only two
[1:00:52] powers. You're either led by the Holy
[1:00:54] Spirit dwelling abiding in you or you're
[1:00:57] led by a wrong spirit. You're you've got
[1:01:00] to you're a sheep. You have to be led
[1:01:04] and someone's leading you. Something a
[1:01:06] person is leading you.
[1:01:11] And if you say, "Well, I can lead my own
[1:01:13] self." No. Then you've got the enemy
[1:01:15] leading you
[1:01:16] &gt;&gt; because your enemy happens to be this
[1:01:19] man. I'm This is enemy right here. This
[1:01:21] old carnal self
[1:01:22] &gt;&gt; that's in my way every day is my enemy.
[1:01:24] It's emnity.
[1:01:25] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:01:26] &gt;&gt; And emity means it's my enemy.
[1:01:30] &gt;&gt; And we are commanded to bring it under
[1:01:32] obedience every day. Isn't that what he
[1:01:34] said? He's your head. Give your all to
[1:01:37] him and follow him.
[1:01:38] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:01:39] &gt;&gt; Luke 9:23 said, "If you'll follow me,"
[1:01:42] Jesus said, then deny yourself. Deny
[1:01:45] yourself. Take up your cross daily and
[1:01:47] follow me.
[1:01:48] &gt;&gt; Amen. Deny yourself. Give yourself to
[1:01:51] him.
[1:01:53] And when it comes down to making
[1:01:54] decisions, make it with the word. Amen.
[1:01:58] Lean on God to reveal his word. Let him
[1:02:00] reveal. Let him lead you. Guide you. Let
[1:02:03] him direct your Let him, Brother Ram
[1:02:05] said this. He said, "Lord, lead me,
[1:02:06] guide me, direct me in what pleases
[1:02:09] you." And he said, "Without faith, it's
[1:02:12] impossible to please him."
[1:02:14] &gt;&gt; So, how's he going to lead us? By faith.
[1:02:17] &gt;&gt; Amen. So if you led by faith, then your
[1:02:21] leadership is perfect. He's guiding you.
[1:02:24] He's leading you. He can't make a
[1:02:25] mistake in leading you. His ways are
[1:02:27] perfect. And if you're relying on him,
[1:02:30] your way can't be anything but perfect
[1:02:32] because you're in him. Your way is
[1:02:34] perfect.
[1:02:35] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:02:36] &gt;&gt; I don't care what you think about it,
[1:02:38] what I think about it. I have all kinds
[1:02:40] of thoughts about it. I don't understand
[1:02:41] how he leads me. You don't have to
[1:02:43] understand how the shepherd leads you.
[1:02:45] You need to trust him.
[1:02:47] &gt;&gt; Amen. You need to give yourself to him.
[1:02:49] He's your shepherd. Let him lead you. He
[1:02:51] can't lead you astray. He's got to lead
[1:02:53] you into all truth.
[1:02:56] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:02:57] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. That's right.
[1:03:00] Then what manner of people ought we to
[1:03:02] be in all holy conversation, all all
[1:03:04] manner of living and godliness.
[1:03:08] Amen.
[1:03:09] &gt;&gt; What's godliness? Like God.
[1:03:13] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. All right. We are we are not
[1:03:16] this is a direct quote brother Brandham
[1:03:18] he said we are not creatures of time.
[1:03:24] Amen. Who do you think you are then?
[1:03:27] He said you're we're creatures of
[1:03:30] eternity.
[1:03:33] &gt;&gt; There you are.
[1:03:36] &gt;&gt; We're not creatures of time. We are
[1:03:38] creatures of eternity.
[1:03:42] &gt;&gt; All right. eternity. There's only one
[1:03:44] person that's eternal,
[1:03:47] and that's God.
[1:03:48] &gt;&gt; And if we're creatures of eternity, we
[1:03:50] had to be the thought of himself
[1:03:53] &gt;&gt; to begin with. That's why he'll never
[1:03:56] share his glory with another.
[1:03:58] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:03:58] &gt;&gt; But he he will share his glory with you
[1:04:00] because you're not another. The bride is
[1:04:02] not another. She is him.
[1:04:08] &gt;&gt; All right. So,
[1:04:10] so we see here the bride. We're not
[1:04:14] creatures, as I said, we're not
[1:04:15] creatures of time. We're creatures of
[1:04:18] eternity. We are spoken word creation of
[1:04:21] God. We are a spoken word creation. The
[1:04:25] written word, this written Bible has
[1:04:27] only been what, the last 250 years,
[1:04:29] maybe three, that we have this in
[1:04:32] written form.
[1:04:33] &gt;&gt; The original seed was not written word.
[1:04:36] It was spoken word.
[1:04:39] Amen. Are you with me? The original seed
[1:04:43] is spoken word.
[1:04:45] &gt;&gt; And you're the original seed.
[1:04:49] Before it was before it was any emotion,
[1:04:51] sensation or anything. It was the word.
[1:04:54] In the beginning was the word and the
[1:04:57] word was with God and the word was God.
[1:04:59] And when the eagle comes on the scene, a
[1:05:01] flying eagle and the seals are open,
[1:05:04] brother Bram said the eagle steps on the
[1:05:06] scene. Every age had to live under the
[1:05:08] anointing that they had. First age lion,
[1:05:12] then ox, then man. And Pentecost, it
[1:05:15] went from Luther Wesley to Pentecost was
[1:05:17] still reformation under man. The
[1:05:19] Pentecostal experience which every one
[1:05:22] of us need to come through. The
[1:05:23] Pentecost was the restoration of the
[1:05:26] gifts.
[1:05:27] &gt;&gt; Many are still under that. They haven't
[1:05:29] entered in to the opened word.
[1:05:34] &gt;&gt; Amen. Yeah,
[1:05:35] &gt;&gt; I'm saying I'm not saying who is and who
[1:05:37] isn't. I'm saying many of people are
[1:05:39] back. We believe the gifts, but the
[1:05:41] emphasis isn't on the gifts now. It's on
[1:05:43] the word itself.
[1:05:47] &gt;&gt; Right. Amen.
[1:05:48] &gt;&gt; Nobody's doing away with gifts. Nobody.
[1:05:50] I've I've had gifts. I've met gifts.
[1:05:52] I've prophesied. I've spoken tongues. I
[1:05:54] believe in every one of those things.
[1:05:55] But you can have every one of those
[1:05:57] things anointed by the genuine spirit
[1:05:59] and go to hell
[1:06:02] &gt;&gt; because the word is what makes the
[1:06:04] difference. The word, the person, the
[1:06:07] word in you. And you're the expression
[1:06:09] of that word. You came on the scene
[1:06:12] because the book was opened.
[1:06:14] &gt;&gt; The book was opened. The book is not a
[1:06:16] book of leather like we have or this
[1:06:17] Bible. That's not the Bible is, by the
[1:06:20] way, the full redemption. I mean the the
[1:06:22] full re the the book of redemption. Yes.
[1:06:26] But the book spoken of is not a book
[1:06:28] like that. It's himself.
[1:06:32] &gt;&gt; It's himself.
[1:06:33] &gt;&gt; He opened himself.
[1:06:35] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:06:37] &gt;&gt; Thank the Lord we have it in written
[1:06:38] form. We're not doing away with written
[1:06:40] form. But as long as you got an
[1:06:42] intellectual knowledge of the letter, it
[1:06:43] won't do you a bit of good.
[1:06:45] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:06:45] &gt;&gt; You have to have revelation. God said,
[1:06:47] "I'll reveal myself." and he'll only
[1:06:49] reveal the message to his bride.
[1:06:52] &gt;&gt; That's what makes the difference was
[1:06:53] revelation. That was the difference
[1:06:55] between Cain and Abel was revelation.
[1:06:59] &gt;&gt; That the only difference
[1:07:01] &gt;&gt; they both sacrificed. They both had a
[1:07:03] church.
[1:07:04] &gt;&gt; And you can and I I can tell you right
[1:07:06] now, they could both be anointed by the
[1:07:08] hol by the Holy Ghost to do those works.
[1:07:13] But one had the revelation of what God
[1:07:16] wanted and and meant for the hour and
[1:07:18] the season and the time
[1:07:20] &gt;&gt; and that makes the difference today.
[1:07:23] &gt;&gt; One can enter into the full word. One
[1:07:26] can enter but till before the eagle with
[1:07:28] that eagle anointing came. Amen. It
[1:07:31] turned to the word itself completely.
[1:07:36] &gt;&gt; Amen. Remember, we had the the
[1:07:38] restoration of the gifts of Pentecost
[1:07:40] and the baptism of the Holy Spirit.
[1:07:43] And we all have to have the baptism of
[1:07:45] the Holy Spirit. But remember, you
[1:07:47] cannot be born again unless the Holy
[1:07:49] Spirit falls on a predestinated seed in
[1:07:51] your heart. The ground had to be
[1:07:52] pre-prepared.
[1:07:54] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:07:55] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:07:55] &gt;&gt; That word had to be laying there for it
[1:07:57] to be quickened. And that's the only way
[1:07:59] that you can have a real birth. And when
[1:08:01] you have a birth and you're going to
[1:08:03] discern the message of the hour, you're
[1:08:05] going to see the message of the hour and
[1:08:07] you're going to realize and accept the
[1:08:09] message of the hour and your life will
[1:08:11] express it.
[1:08:14] &gt;&gt; Because it's revealed to you. And
[1:08:16] there's the true evidence right there of
[1:08:19] agape love. Because brother Bram said
[1:08:22] love was not the evidence of having the
[1:08:25] Holy Ghost.
[1:08:27] Yeah. I don't even hear an amen. You
[1:08:29] know, that's what he said. He said the
[1:08:31] evidence was having a true revelation
[1:08:33] and a and of the hour and the time and
[1:08:36] the message of the hour.
[1:08:39] That's what he said. And he took us
[1:08:41] right back to the scripture in in St.
[1:08:43] John in in St. No in yeah St. John 16.
[1:08:49] He'll show you these things to come. He
[1:08:51] will teach you and show you those things
[1:08:53] revealed. Brother Brandham said he will
[1:08:55] reveal it to you.
[1:08:58] Having a clear understanding of the
[1:09:00] hour, receiving the word for the season,
[1:09:03] Brother Brandham said, is the genuine
[1:09:06] evidence that the Holy Ghost is living
[1:09:08] in you.
[1:09:10] &gt;&gt; And if it's the Jeanwide evidence of the
[1:09:12] Holy Ghost in you, then you have a
[1:09:13] genuine evidence that you are in and
[1:09:16] have agape love.
[1:09:18] &gt;&gt; That's 1 Corinthians 13. Without turning
[1:09:21] to it, be saving time. 1 Corinthians 13
[1:09:24] said, "I could do all these things. I
[1:09:25] could I could I could well, you could
[1:09:27] you could preach. You could do all the
[1:09:29] He said, "I can have knowledge of the of
[1:09:31] the of the of the uh
[1:09:35] let's just read it."
[1:09:38] Amen. Let's go over to 1 Corinthians 13.
[1:09:40] I'll take that side step just a minute
[1:09:43] since I'm on that point.
[1:09:46] 1 Corinthians
[1:09:53] 13th.
[1:10:01] Though I speak with tongue of men and
[1:10:03] angels and have not charity, I am become
[1:10:05] as a sounding brass or a tinkling
[1:10:07] symbol.
[1:10:09] Charity is the capstone.
[1:10:12] It's Christ. Charity is a person.
[1:10:16] Charity is God himself. Charity is him
[1:10:19] in you living. Right?
[1:10:21] &gt;&gt; And the only ones that can have charity
[1:10:23] is them that are in Christ to begin God
[1:10:25] to begin with.
[1:10:27] &gt;&gt; Just think of that a minute. People are
[1:10:30] they can they can have knowledge. They
[1:10:32] can they can have wisdom. They can have
[1:10:33] all those things and still not have
[1:10:35] charity. Let's go on and read. I speak
[1:10:38] with the tongue of men and angels and
[1:10:39] have not charity. I'm become as a
[1:10:41] sounding brass or tinkling symbol. And
[1:10:44] nobody, brother, sister, we don't don't
[1:10:46] even think for a minute. I don't believe
[1:10:48] in speaking in tongues. I do.
[1:10:52] But the word for the hour and Brother
[1:10:54] Bram said this ministry and I I'll come
[1:10:56] to that in a minute. But they can
[1:10:58] they're anointed by the genuine. That's
[1:11:00] why you better be careful how you speak
[1:11:02] against an anointing.
[1:11:04] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:11:06] &gt;&gt; Amen. Judas was anointed. He was given
[1:11:08] power to cast out devils. And he was a
[1:11:10] son of predition. Is that right?
[1:11:13] &gt;&gt; Balam was anointed with the same Holy
[1:11:15] Spirit that Moses was anointed with.
[1:11:20] same Holy Spirit. What was the
[1:11:22] difference? Not the not the sign. He
[1:11:24] could his prophecy, Balam's prophecy is
[1:11:26] still happening. Those that bless Israel
[1:11:28] will be blessed. Those who curse Israel
[1:11:30] will be cursed. His prophecy still
[1:11:32] living on. He couldn't prophesy anything
[1:11:34] different. Then what was the difference?
[1:11:36] His teaching was not the word for the
[1:11:38] season.
[1:11:40] &gt;&gt; And Moses's teaching was perfect.
[1:11:43] There's your difference.
[1:11:47] Amen.
[1:11:52] &gt;&gt; That's that brother Ram said we ought
[1:11:53] this is a mystery that came to pass
[1:11:56] after the opening of those seven seals.
[1:11:58] How those things could be anointed.
[1:12:00] Everyone we believe in signs. We believe
[1:12:02] in miracles. We believe in and in in
[1:12:04] prophecy and they prophesy the truth.
[1:12:07] You can be baptized with the Holy Ghost
[1:12:09] every day of your life. And brother
[1:12:10] Brandham said it's just a temporal gift
[1:12:12] for you. The real gift is your soul down
[1:12:14] in there that can receive and hear the
[1:12:16] word. He said and that's the evidence of
[1:12:19] this charity. You don't know you have
[1:12:21] can say the Lord the Jesus is my Lord.
[1:12:25] You can't see charity or know charity
[1:12:30] without
[1:12:32] without him in you.
[1:12:37] &gt;&gt; Unless you're born again, you cannot
[1:12:38] call Jesus Lord.
[1:12:42] Oh, you could you could say it, but it
[1:12:44] doesn't mean anything. It's a tinkling
[1:12:45] symbol.
[1:12:48] &gt;&gt; Amen. Because you don't know him as
[1:12:51] Lord.
[1:12:52] &gt;&gt; The born again know him as Lord.
[1:12:57] &gt;&gt; All right. Now,
[1:13:00] so uh Oh, I was going to say, so Balum,
[1:13:03] what difference was was this teaching?
[1:13:05] He said, "Where? Why? They're all the
[1:13:06] same. Let's all come together. We're all
[1:13:08] the same." And brother Brandham said it
[1:13:11] was an un the Lord the word God said it
[1:13:13] was an unpardonable sin and he never
[1:13:15] forgave Israel for that. And the same
[1:13:18] spirit same Holy Spirit was anointing
[1:13:22] two men and Kora they had signs and
[1:13:26] wonders and they followed Moses' message
[1:13:28] you can say to the letter but
[1:13:33] they had the same spirit of Ba they had
[1:13:35] the same teaching of Balum. They come
[1:13:37] against the ministry of the day of the
[1:13:39] hour. Do you know, brother Bram said
[1:13:41] Moses was the anointed word in his day
[1:13:44] and he turned right around and said the
[1:13:45] seventh angel is the anointed word for
[1:13:47] our day.
[1:13:50] See, we we cannot we have to be careful
[1:13:54] what we say about this message.
[1:13:56] &gt;&gt; We're not following a man. We are
[1:13:58] following his message. But God separated
[1:14:01] himself to that one man. And without
[1:14:03] that man's message, you will never know
[1:14:06] this Bible.
[1:14:07] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:14:07] &gt;&gt; You will never understand it. You'll
[1:14:09] never have an understanding of it.
[1:14:11] That's right. No way.
[1:14:15] You cannot interpret it yourself.
[1:14:19] &gt;&gt; Amen. We already have a perfect
[1:14:21] interpretation. That's what God sent a
[1:14:23] prophet for. The prophets were the
[1:14:25] interpretation of the word for their
[1:14:26] season.
[1:14:28] And brother Brandham said the seed of
[1:14:29] God that could receive the life of God
[1:14:32] was the very interpretation of the word
[1:14:34] for their season.
[1:14:37] But God used a prophet to interpret it.
[1:14:40] We are not the interpreters. We are the
[1:14:42] interpretation of it.
[1:14:45] &gt;&gt; But God used a prophet and put the sword
[1:14:48] in his hand. And I want you to know
[1:14:50] whose sword it was. It was the king's
[1:14:52] sword. It wasn't a sword. It was the
[1:14:55] king's sword. It was the word.
[1:14:58] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:15:01] &gt;&gt; So, we better start feeding on the book.
[1:15:03] You expect to go home and make a
[1:15:04] rapture, you better start consuming the
[1:15:06] book. You better start eating the book
[1:15:08] because when you you don't have nothing
[1:15:10] else to do, he said he said that book
[1:15:12] wasn't even be even able to be taken by
[1:15:15] a man.
[1:15:18] &gt;&gt; No way. He said no one was worthy to
[1:15:20] open that book or loose it or even look
[1:15:22] upon it. And here we find
[1:15:26] the ministry of the seventh angel. God
[1:15:28] used to interpret that book. Open it.
[1:15:31] That was his ministry. And when he
[1:15:34] opened the book, he opened up us. It was
[1:15:36] you because you were the book.
[1:15:39] Amen. So when he opened that book, what
[1:15:42] happened?
[1:15:44] It loosed
[1:15:47] you to your position.
[1:15:52] You were positionally placed because
[1:15:54] remember what the prophet said. He
[1:15:56] opened those seals. And what were those
[1:15:58] seals opened for? To show the bride
[1:16:00] where she came from, who she is, and
[1:16:01] where she's going.
[1:16:02] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:16:04] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:16:07] Hallelujah.
[1:16:08] We needed that open book.
[1:16:11] &gt;&gt; Without the open book, even though the
[1:16:13] price was paid at Calvary, but he had to
[1:16:15] open the book to claim what he redeemed.
[1:16:18] Well, you say how can how can you
[1:16:20] listen? Brother Brandham said he stepped
[1:16:22] forward right at the end of the age. The
[1:16:25] end of the seventh age, Christ stepped
[1:16:27] forward and took the book and opened it.
[1:16:30] &gt;&gt; Yep.
[1:16:31] &gt;&gt; What means by stepping forward? Because
[1:16:33] if he steps forward, he's leading the
[1:16:35] way. You just follow him.
[1:16:38] &gt;&gt; Okay. So, every predestinated seed that
[1:16:40] was in that book will have to come to
[1:16:42] the position. They that were ready went
[1:16:45] in the marriage with him.
[1:16:47] went in with him in the marriage. Amen.
[1:16:51] All right. And then then what? When?
[1:16:54] What? How? When the last one comes in,
[1:16:56] what happens? The door shut.
[1:17:00] Not another one can come in. No. Not.
[1:17:02] And yet the ministry will go right on
[1:17:04] for a season.
[1:17:07] Preaching to the eternal loss. And yet
[1:17:09] the message being preached is for the
[1:17:12] bride and the church. You say, "Why the
[1:17:14] church?" because they're a sanctified
[1:17:15] people. And by ministering that message,
[1:17:19] that opens the door for them to bless
[1:17:21] you and do what's right. And in the
[1:17:22] judgment,
[1:17:24] they get are given eternal life. They
[1:17:27] can't be in the bride.
[1:17:29] But they're good people, sanctified
[1:17:31] people.
[1:17:34] I won't go into all that. I've already
[1:17:35] been through a series on that. So that's
[1:17:38] truth.
[1:17:40] Amen. All right.
[1:17:43] So
[1:17:45] the bride is the faith of God moving in
[1:17:49] you active. What's moving in you that
[1:17:53] that that faith in you is active. It's
[1:17:55] living. It's leading and it's directing.
[1:17:58] &gt;&gt; Amen. Into all truth right into a body
[1:18:02] change right into the rapture. That's
[1:18:04] exactly what it is. You've already got
[1:18:06] the rapture. Listen, the rapture is
[1:18:08] going. The move is on for the bride. He
[1:18:10] saw the preview her marching. Right.
[1:18:12] &gt;&gt; She was going. The rapture is going.
[1:18:16] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:18:16] &gt;&gt; It's already going.
[1:18:20] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:18:22] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. It's on the go right now.
[1:18:24] And when that last one, when that little
[1:18:26] bride recognizes what it is,
[1:18:31] the rapture, he said, will go.
[1:18:34] Not come. Go.
[1:18:38] &gt;&gt; Amen. Hallelujah. People don't even
[1:18:40] realize a lot of I'm well I say people I
[1:18:44] it's it's not my business to know who
[1:18:46] but I'm thankful it's an individual
[1:18:48] affair
[1:18:50] &gt;&gt; and I can know that and you can know
[1:18:52] that and it's a it's more real than I'm
[1:18:54] have my look at my body here stand more
[1:18:56] that it's more real than that.
[1:19:00] &gt;&gt; Amen. And the brother prophet said it's
[1:19:02] already happening. It's already taking
[1:19:04] place. The rapture is taking place.
[1:19:07] And how do you know that last one hasn't
[1:19:09] raptured and come to who they are? See,
[1:19:12] &gt;&gt; see, it's a rapturing up. Revelations
[1:19:14] 4:1 wasn't just an uh it was a spiritual
[1:19:19] rapture of John, which is a type of the
[1:19:21] bride. He was caught up, seated in
[1:19:24] heavenly places in Christ Jesus. Brother
[1:19:27] Brandham said he was raptured up.
[1:19:31] Amen. All right. So, see, where are you
[1:19:34] seated? Where are you? Where's God in?
[1:19:37] Where where's the God of Elijah today?
[1:19:41] Amen. He had to follow him, didn't he?
[1:19:43] Elijah Elisha had to follow. And three
[1:19:46] times Elijah tried to get him to terry.
[1:19:49] You know, I've got to go here. Why don't
[1:19:50] you tar here? I've got to go here. Why
[1:19:52] don't you tar here? I got to t here. No,
[1:19:54] he said, I'm not going to leave you.
[1:19:56] &gt;&gt; When he was called, he left everything.
[1:19:58] When El when Elisha was called by
[1:20:01] Elijah,
[1:20:02] &gt;&gt; God told him to go call Elisha to sit in
[1:20:05] your room. Amen. He knew he's coming
[1:20:08] down the end of his ministry. And Elisha
[1:20:10] actually these we sing a song. These are
[1:20:12] the days of Elijah. Actually, these are
[1:20:14] the days of Elisha.
[1:20:18] &gt;&gt; Because under her messenger, she's the
[1:20:21] final voice to the final age.
[1:20:24] &gt;&gt; This is the days of Elisha.
[1:20:27] It's the bride coming of Christ.
[1:20:30] &gt;&gt; That's exactly what that's the mystery
[1:20:32] of his coming. That's the seventh seal
[1:20:34] mystery is his coming of how he comes
[1:20:36] and when he comes. I could read it right
[1:20:38] out of the book. I've got it right here.
[1:20:39] Christ the mystery. He said that's the
[1:20:41] seventh seal and that's what I'm
[1:20:43] speaking to you today. He said that's
[1:20:45] what I'm opening up to you. I've never
[1:20:47] brought it because it was he couldn't
[1:20:49] bring it because that was the silence of
[1:20:51] Revelations 10 when it opened. But it
[1:20:56] opened. Brother Bram said, "Notice it's
[1:20:58] opened."
[1:21:01] And the opening, the silence meant it
[1:21:03] was a mystery, but it was known and is
[1:21:05] known to the bride. Amen. Amen. It was
[1:21:09] only shut for a season because it had to
[1:21:12] be shut because that's exactly trying to
[1:21:15] note that's what John couldn't write.
[1:21:19] And brother Bram said that seventh seal
[1:21:21] revelation is the revelation of his
[1:21:23] coming.
[1:21:25] Amen.
[1:21:27] Are we going to meet him in the air?
[1:21:28] Yes, sir. But without this revelation,
[1:21:30] you won't be there.
[1:21:32] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:21:33] &gt;&gt; You say that's pretty blunt, brother
[1:21:35] David, that that's the truth.
[1:21:37] &gt;&gt; You say you scare us. It shouldn't scare
[1:21:39] you. It should rejoice.
[1:21:41] &gt;&gt; It shouldn't be a scary thing to you.
[1:21:43] See, see, if you're not sure when when a
[1:21:46] person when a man is when a person is
[1:21:48] double-minded, they're not sure of where
[1:21:50] they're standing,
[1:21:50] &gt;&gt; right?
[1:21:52] &gt;&gt; They're fearful,
[1:21:53] &gt;&gt; right? They're they're fearful about
[1:21:55] what they're doing. They're not sure of
[1:21:57] what they're doing.
[1:22:00] Amen. It's confusion. The middleman,
[1:22:02] Brother Aram said, is the worst place to
[1:22:04] be.
[1:22:05] &gt;&gt; Here's Adam that believed the truth.
[1:22:07] Here's Satan that didn't believe. And
[1:22:08] Eve was in the middle.
[1:22:11] &gt;&gt; Amen. There's a man that's gung-ho. This
[1:22:13] will make a great present. The other one
[1:22:15] says, "Oh, he's a hypocrite." And then
[1:22:17] the other one in the middle doesn't know
[1:22:18] what to do. And brother Brandham said
[1:22:19] that's the same way it is in religion
[1:22:22] in Christianity. He said there's always
[1:22:24] the middle one that don't know what to
[1:22:26] do.
[1:22:28] He said that's the bad place to be
[1:22:31] because he's double minded. He doesn't
[1:22:33] know which way to go. He's caught in
[1:22:34] between.
[1:22:37] &gt;&gt; Amen. Don't Don't be caught in between.
[1:22:39] Start feeding on the book. Start eating
[1:22:41] the book.
[1:22:44] Quit quit him hh hh hh hh hh hh hh hh hh
[1:22:46] hhawing around with so many other things
[1:22:47] and start eating the book and God will
[1:22:49] take care of the rest of it.
[1:22:51] &gt;&gt; The very escape you need is written
[1:22:53] right here right here in this message of
[1:22:55] the seventh angel. The eagle message and
[1:22:58] we're under that eagle anointing. What
[1:23:00] is it? Revelation flying high. Even we
[1:23:04] can find that eagle anointing right in
[1:23:06] there between Elijah and Gahhesi when
[1:23:08] the Syrians said, you know, the king was
[1:23:11] talking about, well, who's letting who's
[1:23:12] letting those those king of Israel know
[1:23:16] what's going on? Every time I show up,
[1:23:18] he's not there. Who now? Which one of
[1:23:20] you doing that? He said, well, it's not
[1:23:21] us doing it. It's a prophet. Well, let's
[1:23:23] go after that prophet. So, they surround
[1:23:25] Syria. I mean they surround Israel,
[1:23:28] surround Jerusalem or I don't if he was
[1:23:31] in Jerusalem at the time but wherever
[1:23:32] Elijah was they surrounded him
[1:23:35] and Gahesy looks out the window gets up
[1:23:37] in the morning and his seat legs start
[1:23:39] trembling as our brother said one time I
[1:23:41] kind of like like the way he said it the
[1:23:43] knees start shaking and started
[1:23:45] trembling he says master
[1:23:48] he said just relax there's more of us
[1:23:50] than them
[1:23:52] &gt;&gt; right
[1:23:53] &gt;&gt; and and then
[1:23:55] that prophet which was an eagle, he
[1:23:58] turned around and said, "God, open that
[1:24:00] boy's eyes." He sent his anointing of
[1:24:03] what he saw, asked God and sent that
[1:24:05] same anointing on him. And I tell you
[1:24:08] right now, how our eyes, our eyes come
[1:24:10] open, unless God sent an eagle.
[1:24:14] &gt;&gt; Because otherwise, you're still under
[1:24:15] the man age.
[1:24:17] &gt;&gt; You see what I'm saying? You have to
[1:24:19] live to that time. And that that is the
[1:24:21] word again.
[1:24:24] Amen. You're not an you weren't a
[1:24:26] chicken to begin with. You're an eagle.
[1:24:28] The only thing you'd hear the scream is
[1:24:29] of an eagle.
[1:24:32] &gt;&gt; That's the only voice you know.
[1:24:34] &gt;&gt; Okay. So he said, "Open that boy's
[1:24:36] eyes." And when he opened his eyes,
[1:24:37] there they were chariots of fire all
[1:24:39] around him.
[1:24:42] And so that that settled Gahesy.
[1:24:46] &gt;&gt; Amen. He wasn't afraid of them anymore.
[1:24:48] He said, "Here you are. Okay, come on.
[1:24:51] Come on. Call it on there. more more of
[1:24:54] us than you.
[1:24:56] &gt;&gt; That's right. Makes you pretty bold when
[1:24:58] you realize what you are and who you are
[1:25:00] and where you're standing. Bold in the
[1:25:02] spirit. Not bold in your nature. Bold,
[1:25:04] but bold in the Holy Spirit. Stand
[1:25:07] toe-to-toe with that devil.
[1:25:09] &gt;&gt; My computer started acting up my
[1:25:11] printer. I said, "Satan, take your hands
[1:25:14] off it. Lord, touch this computer." And
[1:25:16] then paused. Wouldn't print. All of a
[1:25:20] sudden, started printing.
[1:25:24] Amen.
[1:25:27] Amen. Just here recently, this may sound
[1:25:30] strange, but I it's not anything I did,
[1:25:32] but when you're inspired to do
[1:25:34] something, act upon the spirit of the
[1:25:36] moment.
[1:25:37] &gt;&gt; Let the leadership of the Holy Spirit,
[1:25:38] you've given yourself to him, trust him
[1:25:40] in everything you do. He'll order your
[1:25:43] way. He'll order your steps. And if it's
[1:25:45] off the word, get away from it just as
[1:25:47] quick as you can. Right?
[1:25:49] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:25:52] down visiting a few months ago
[1:25:55] in Arizona. It was when the hummingbirds
[1:25:58] were still feeding and everything. I
[1:25:59] walked out one morning, we were getting
[1:26:01] ready to go and there was a dead
[1:26:02] hummingbird.
[1:26:06] The Lord put it in my heart to ask for
[1:26:08] the life of that hummingbird.
[1:26:11] And you know what? He raised from the
[1:26:13] dead.
[1:26:16] Oh, now, brother David, listen. Don't
[1:26:19] tell me he doesn't mean to the little
[1:26:21] things that if he meant that to that
[1:26:22] little thing, what about what about the
[1:26:24] rest of it? What about your life? What
[1:26:26] about your leadership? What about him
[1:26:28] guiding you?
[1:26:30] &gt;&gt; Why are you questioning what he made you
[1:26:32] to be? Why are you finding fault with
[1:26:34] it?
[1:26:36] &gt;&gt; God made you the way you are.
[1:26:39] Start feeding on the book. Start opening
[1:26:41] the word. Start start putting that as
[1:26:43] the head over all everything else. and
[1:26:46] do what the Holy Ghost said for you to
[1:26:48] do and quit your fearing about doing it.
[1:26:52] Do what he said to do. Let go of
[1:26:55] everything and give it all to him and do
[1:26:57] what he said to do. He'll take care of
[1:26:58] the rest of it. You don't have to fear,
[1:27:00] well, if I do this, if I do that, if I
[1:27:02] stop doing this, what are people going
[1:27:03] to think? Where am I going to get my
[1:27:04] money? Where am I going to do this?
[1:27:06] Where am I going to do that?
[1:27:09] Let's stop being double-minded and get
[1:27:11] down to one head, one God, one mind. All
[1:27:16] right.
[1:27:18] &gt;&gt; Amen. A double mind means wavering.
[1:27:22] You're wavering.
[1:27:24] Amen. You remember, you remember, let me
[1:27:26] just say this before that. His church
[1:27:28] bride, his church
[1:27:32] is himself
[1:27:33] revealed.
[1:27:36] Yes.
[1:27:37] &gt;&gt; His bride is himself
[1:27:40] revealed.
[1:27:43] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen.
[1:27:46] And that's when Christ reveals to
[1:27:49] himself personally to you, the mystery
[1:27:51] is revealed. That brother Bram said is
[1:27:53] the new birth.
[1:27:56] &gt;&gt; All right. Now, so Jesus Christ
[1:28:01] revealed in you.
[1:28:04] Jesus Christ the new birth. This is
[1:28:06] exactly how I said that. Jesus Christ
[1:28:08] the new birth is revealed in you.
[1:28:12] Amen. Right. Now, the bride is not
[1:28:16] double-minded. James 1:8 said, "A
[1:28:19] double-minded man is unstable in all his
[1:28:21] ways." Double-minded means wavering,
[1:28:24] uncertain, divided in interest. He's
[1:28:27] wavering. He's uncertain and he's
[1:28:29] divided in interest. His interest is
[1:28:32] divided. He's not fully for Christ. See,
[1:28:36] see now I just keep reading here what I
[1:28:38] wrote down here. Wavering uncertain
[1:28:40] divided. Your heart is not fixed in
[1:28:43] Christ alone.
[1:28:48] A double-minded man. His heart is not
[1:28:50] fixed in Christ alone. For you to live,
[1:28:54] for you to live is not Christ alone.
[1:28:58] Remember what Paul said, for me to live
[1:28:59] is Christ. To die is gain.
[1:29:02] My heart, your heart should be fixed on
[1:29:04] one head.
[1:29:07] &gt;&gt; And everything we do ought to ought to
[1:29:09] be ought that little wheel in the middle
[1:29:11] of the wheel ought to ought to direct
[1:29:13] everything you do.
[1:29:15] &gt;&gt; And it will not take you off of the
[1:29:17] word.
[1:29:18] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:29:20] &gt;&gt; Amen. It will not it will not it cannot
[1:29:23] take you from away from the word.
[1:29:26] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:29:27] &gt;&gt; Because he is the word and you're in
[1:29:30] him. You're the word.
[1:29:33] Amen. You can't deny the word because
[1:29:35] you are the word. All right. Now, so
[1:29:40] you are double-minded. You can't be
[1:29:42] married to two heads at the same time.
[1:29:44] The word says so. It must be one head.
[1:29:50] &gt;&gt; The bride, the prophet said, is heavenly
[1:29:52] minded, and heaven consists of the word.
[1:29:56] Amen. All right. She's not leaning to
[1:29:59] her own understanding. Proverbs 3:5. She
[1:30:01] doesn't lean to her own understanding.
[1:30:03] She's following him. I'm not saying
[1:30:05] Satan will try to get you to lean to
[1:30:07] your own understanding. He'll put you
[1:30:09] try to get you. I'm not talking about
[1:30:11] that. I'm talking about what the soul
[1:30:13] believes.
[1:30:15] &gt;&gt; It will not lean to your own
[1:30:16] understanding.
[1:30:18] It tried to bring that in. There's a
[1:30:20] correction right there. You know it. You
[1:30:21] discern it. There's a discerner that
[1:30:23] discerns the enemy. I don't care how
[1:30:25] slick he is, how how un how he comes in
[1:30:29] that Holy Ghost in you will discern who
[1:30:31] it is.
[1:30:33] &gt;&gt; When you hear a voice out here, the Holy
[1:30:35] Ghost will discern. It'll give you
[1:30:37] discernment. In fact, I got a quote on
[1:30:39] that. Let me just say what he said in
[1:30:41] that quote here.
[1:30:44] He said this.
[1:30:50] Now our eternal destination is not
[1:30:53] altogether determined by what we see and
[1:30:56] what we hear.
[1:31:00] Our eternal our eternal destination
[1:31:04] is not altogether determined and he he's
[1:31:08] preaching this in discerning the body of
[1:31:10] the Lord.
[1:31:12] &gt;&gt; Okay. 59 81259
[1:31:16] he said our eternal destination is not
[1:31:18] altogether determined by what we see and
[1:31:20] what we hear but it's determined on what
[1:31:23] discernment you have of what you see and
[1:31:27] what you hear
[1:31:30] &gt;&gt; amen
[1:31:32] &gt;&gt; why one can discern what they hear the
[1:31:34] other one said that's not the truth
[1:31:37] that's that's a lie they didn't catch it
[1:31:40] what the what the apostle what the what
[1:31:42] The Pharisees and the Sadducees, how
[1:31:44] they discern Jesus Christ, he's
[1:31:46] Beloveub.
[1:31:47] &gt;&gt; Right?
[1:31:47] &gt;&gt; The little woman at the well discerned
[1:31:49] it and said, "You're Messiah."
[1:31:53] &gt;&gt; What's the difference? Their
[1:31:55] discernment.
[1:31:57] &gt;&gt; She didn't see a beautiful man all in
[1:31:59] robes, but she saw a man that knew the
[1:32:01] secrets of the heart, and that was the
[1:32:03] word of God.
[1:32:04] &gt;&gt; That was the living word to her because
[1:32:07] she had discernment. She had she was
[1:32:10] predestinated. had a predestinated seed
[1:32:12] there. That was a that was a a a hearing
[1:32:16] post to hear the true word.
[1:32:19] And she didn't make that up. She didn't
[1:32:22] figure it out. She didn't go to a book
[1:32:23] about it. She discerned it right there.
[1:32:27] We know that when Messiah cometh, he'll
[1:32:29] do these things. But who are you? He
[1:32:32] said, "I am he." That's all she need to
[1:32:34] hear. That put her on fire right there.
[1:32:36] She left that old clay water pot and
[1:32:39] started drinking from a fountain. just
[1:32:41] what we sang about. There is a fountain
[1:32:44] open.
[1:32:45] &gt;&gt; Amen. That never runs dry. All right.
[1:32:50] &gt;&gt; Paul was not disputing with them. Okay.
[1:32:53] Now, let's just take something here if
[1:32:55] you don't mind.
[1:32:58] Brother Brandham said. Now, no man, now
[1:33:01] we're talking about discernment. Now,
[1:33:03] watch. No man, no person, no woman, boy,
[1:33:08] girl, I don't care who he is, is fit to
[1:33:11] go in the pulpit or even claim to be a
[1:33:13] Christian without being filled with the
[1:33:16] Holy Ghost.
[1:33:19] You want more? We're coming on
[1:33:22] communion. All right, watch what he
[1:33:24] says.
[1:33:25] He said, "You have no right to the
[1:33:28] Lord's supper or any communion, feet
[1:33:30] washing, or anything until you've been
[1:33:32] cleansed by the holy fire of God."
[1:33:37] Why? Because you're coming up here
[1:33:38] saying, "I'm in communion. I'm in
[1:33:40] fellowship with him." And then go out
[1:33:44] and live another life. Not what what's
[1:33:46] Paul saying here? Paul's not Paul was
[1:33:49] not disputing with them for taking the
[1:33:51] communion. Their act was right, but
[1:33:53] their discernment was wrong.
[1:33:56] &gt;&gt; There it is.
[1:34:02] For taking the Lord's supper is the
[1:34:04] commandment of the Lord, but to take it
[1:34:06] unworthily, not discerning the Lord's
[1:34:09] body. What have we been saying tonight?
[1:34:11] The discerning of the Lord's body.
[1:34:15] What is the Lord's body? It's his body.
[1:34:18] It's the full fullness of himself. You
[1:34:21] are taking those sacraments saying you
[1:34:24] are one with him.
[1:34:28] &gt;&gt; If you aren't one with him, you just
[1:34:30] heard what the prophet said.
[1:34:33] &gt;&gt; Amen. So get right with him. Get things
[1:34:37] right. Come and take it.
[1:34:40] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:34:41] &gt;&gt; Amen. You have no right to take it. Now,
[1:34:44] there's going to be people take it that
[1:34:45] won't even hear that. But there's no
[1:34:47] right to take it unless you are filled
[1:34:49] with the Holy Ghost. And we want we
[1:34:50] don't want people to stop taking. We
[1:34:52] want them to take it. And there's people
[1:34:54] that should be taking it that won't. And
[1:34:56] what's it doing? It's showing them they
[1:34:58] have no place with him. See, it's it it
[1:35:01] you know it. I know that. He said it's a
[1:35:04] showdown.
[1:35:06] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:35:06] &gt;&gt; If you don't take it, you have no
[1:35:08] communion with me.
[1:35:10] &gt;&gt; If you do take it unworthily, then what
[1:35:12] did he say about taking it unworthily?
[1:35:16] See, so what are we going to do? We
[1:35:17] going to have to make our calling
[1:35:18] election and sure, aren't we? By the
[1:35:20] word.
[1:35:22] &gt;&gt; So, let's get start getting oursel in
[1:35:24] the right position with him and approach
[1:35:27] him in the right way.
[1:35:29] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. All right. Then you're going
[1:35:32] to see other things start happening and
[1:35:34] what's what's holding it back will be
[1:35:38] broken.
[1:35:41] All right. Now he said here he said for
[1:35:45] taking the Lord's supper commandment of
[1:35:46] the Lord but take it unworthily you
[1:35:48] don't discern the Lord's body is where
[1:35:50] the wrong lays those Christians who
[1:35:51] taking communion and not living the life
[1:35:54] Christianity
[1:35:57] Christianity
[1:35:59] is a experience and life and these
[1:36:02] Christians were just living any kind of
[1:36:04] like making a poor example of their
[1:36:06] profession and Paul said that's that's
[1:36:09] the cause many are sick and weakly among
[1:36:11] you And many are asleep. And asleep
[1:36:14] means dead.
[1:36:16] Because they haven't discerned the body
[1:36:19] of the Lord. The body of the Lord is
[1:36:24] his word living and in action.
[1:36:27] It's his body.
[1:36:30] Amen. Amen. Okay.
[1:36:34] Now, and we call ourselves Christians
[1:36:37] have no trait to take communion unless
[1:36:38] we are living above a reproach of the
[1:36:41] world. We have no right. The communion
[1:36:43] are for those who are living right as an
[1:36:45] example of Christianity.
[1:36:48] &gt;&gt; That's pretty straight, isn't it?
[1:36:52] &gt;&gt; You know what?
[1:36:54] I like it straight.
[1:36:58] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. That's not to hurt you.
[1:37:01] That's to deliver you.
[1:37:06] &gt;&gt; Okay. May I pass this to you? And we're
[1:37:09] going to come to a close here. very
[1:37:11] soon. Very quick. All right. Now,
[1:37:19] I didn't finish 1 Corinthians 13. And he
[1:37:22] said, "Though I have the gift of
[1:37:24] prophecy, understand all mysteries and
[1:37:26] all knowledge, and though I have all
[1:37:28] faith, so that I could move mountains,
[1:37:30] remove mountains, have all faith and
[1:37:32] remove a mountain, and have not charity,
[1:37:35] I am nothing.
[1:37:37] And though I bestow all my goods to feed
[1:37:39] the poor, and though I give my body to
[1:37:41] be burned, and have not charity, it
[1:37:44] profitth me nothing.
[1:37:47] Amen. Think of that. It's strict, isn't
[1:37:50] it? See how strict it is?
[1:37:53] But it was sent. Who is this all sent
[1:37:55] to? Who is this word speaking to?
[1:38:00] Speaking to his seed, to his life. Amen.
[1:38:05] Amen. All right. Now, first second 1
[1:38:08] Corinthians 2:14.
[1:38:11] Let's just close here on this if we can
[1:38:13] right here. Second 1 Corinthians
[1:38:18] 2:14.
[1:38:25] I could read a lot of the second
[1:38:26] chapter. I love that that second chapter
[1:38:29] of of first Corinthians.
[1:38:35] Let's start with verse 12.
[1:38:38] Well, let's start with verse 11. For
[1:38:40] what man knoweth the things of a man,
[1:38:43] save the spirit of man which is in him?
[1:38:45] Even so, the things of God knoweth no
[1:38:48] man, but the spirit of God. The only way
[1:38:50] you can know the things of God is by the
[1:38:52] spirit of God. Okay?
[1:38:55] Now we have received not the spirit of
[1:38:57] the world but the spirit which is of God
[1:39:01] that we might know. Know is revelation
[1:39:05] know is knowing substance. He said that
[1:39:09] we might know the things that are freely
[1:39:12] given to us of God. Which things also
[1:39:17] notice we speak
[1:39:20] not in the words. Words have a carry
[1:39:23] weight because words is a thought
[1:39:25] expressed.
[1:39:27] Not in the words
[1:39:29] which man's wisdom teacheth, but which
[1:39:32] the Holy Ghost teacheth, comparing
[1:39:35] spiritual things with spiritual.
[1:39:39] Amen. So you're proving things spiritual
[1:39:42] by the spiritual. All right. Now, but
[1:39:46] the natural man receiveth not the things
[1:39:48] of the spirit of God. Now listen to
[1:39:50] this. The natural man does cannot,
[1:39:54] excuse me, but the natural man receiveth
[1:39:56] not the things of the spirit of God. For
[1:40:00] they are foolishness unto him, neither
[1:40:02] can he know them because they are
[1:40:06] spiritually, here's your word,
[1:40:08] discerned.
[1:40:10] They are spiritually discerned.
[1:40:13] But he that is spiritual, is there
[1:40:15] anybody spiritual in here?
[1:40:17] &gt;&gt; Amen. See, but he that is spiritual by
[1:40:19] the spirit birth word in you. He that is
[1:40:23] spiritual judgeth all things.
[1:40:27] Yet he himself is judged of no m.
[1:40:37] Amen. We're not standing under man's
[1:40:39] judgment. We are standing before his
[1:40:41] judgment.
[1:40:43] And he opened the book and he already
[1:40:45] judged his bride. The bride's already
[1:40:47] been judged. That's why she doesn't
[1:40:49] stand before the judgment. All right.
[1:40:51] Now, so
[1:40:54] he himself judged a man. For who hath
[1:40:56] known who hath known the mind of the
[1:40:59] Lord that he may instruct him? But we
[1:41:02] have the mind of Christ. Now, brother
[1:41:05] Brandham said, he said, the prophet
[1:41:08] being there, he said, now we're in the
[1:41:10] seeing time.
[1:41:12] Amen. Because the prophet, the light,
[1:41:15] the interpretation of the word is coming
[1:41:16] forth the message and that's the light
[1:41:18] to walk in. He said you walk in that
[1:41:21] light. Thy light is come. All right. And
[1:41:24] then but he said now watch. He said but
[1:41:27] now there isn't one moving faculty
[1:41:30] beyond the eye.
[1:41:33] That's the last moving faculty of the
[1:41:35] body is beyond the eye. I mean beyond
[1:41:37] the eye. There's no moving faculty. The
[1:41:40] next Why would he say the next? Because
[1:41:43] this is what the bride moves into. The
[1:41:46] next
[1:41:48] is
[1:41:51] Christ is excuse me is the intelligence
[1:41:56] which is Christ itself or himself. See
[1:42:01] the next beyond the moving of the eye
[1:42:03] the next is the intelligence which is
[1:42:06] Christ itself who controls the whole
[1:42:11] body.
[1:42:12] That's the capstone. And the prophet
[1:42:14] said this message is the capstone
[1:42:17] message.
[1:42:21] &gt;&gt; He said another place it's the headstone
[1:42:24] message. So what have we moved into? You
[1:42:28] have the mind of Christ which is the
[1:42:30] word himself in you.
[1:42:33] &gt;&gt; You've moved up. You've turned a corner.
[1:42:37] No longer are you preaching the message
[1:42:38] of Pentecost because the baptism of the
[1:42:41] Holy Ghost made way. If it fell on the
[1:42:43] seed, what'd it do? It was sent for one
[1:42:45] purpose, to make way for the Holy Ghost
[1:42:47] to come right down in perfection back to
[1:42:51] the word again.
[1:42:56] What is it then? It's the word. In the
[1:42:58] beginning was the word. God expressed
[1:43:01] his thought and you're his expression.
[1:43:04] So what is the portion the bride holds?
[1:43:06] The bride's portion is the manifestation
[1:43:09] or revelation
[1:43:11] of the word.
[1:43:13] Amen. This word went out. The book's
[1:43:16] been opened. Who was it open to?
[1:43:19] And then it was given to John and no man
[1:43:21] could read it. But now he was commanded,
[1:43:23] "Take the book.
[1:43:25] &gt;&gt; It's yours. Take it. It's been opened."
[1:43:28] Now he commanded to feed it. He said,
[1:43:30] "Eat it."
[1:43:32] &gt;&gt; And then John said, "Give me." He told
[1:43:34] the angel, "Give me the book."
[1:43:36] &gt;&gt; It's my property. It's revealing who I
[1:43:39] am. It's positionally placing me. And we
[1:43:41] go back to Genesis. Genesis, if if
[1:43:44] you'll turn with me over there real
[1:43:46] quick to Genesis. Genesis 2.
[1:43:49] Look at this real quickly in Genesis 2.
[1:43:53] And the Lord caused a deep sleep to fall
[1:43:55] upon Adam as he did the second Adam. Are
[1:43:58] you with me? I said that so you'll know.
[1:44:01] And he slept. And he took one of his
[1:44:03] ribs and closed up the flesh and stood
[1:44:05] thereof. And the rib which the Lord had
[1:44:07] taken from him made he a woman. So he
[1:44:10] made the woman out of Adam. So what was
[1:44:13] that woman? What was Mrs. Adam? She was
[1:44:16] the sealed mystery in Adam.
[1:44:20] Eve. You say Eve wouldn't even name. But
[1:44:23] the woman was the mystery sealed in
[1:44:26] Adam.
[1:44:27] So, Adam was put to sleep,
[1:44:32] opened up,
[1:44:35] and the elements poured out to make the
[1:44:38] mystery.
[1:44:40] &gt;&gt; I'm talking about when Jesus went to
[1:44:42] Calvary, I would, you were in him then.
[1:44:47] Amen. We were that mystery that still
[1:44:50] had to be unfolded. There was a
[1:44:52] capstone. There was a capstone happening
[1:44:55] in Eden that finished the mystery
[1:44:59] and that was the woman.
[1:45:02] You're the mystery of the book.
[1:45:06] &gt;&gt; You are the mystery. You are the mystery
[1:45:08] of Revelation 107. You are the finished
[1:45:12] mystery.
[1:45:14] So, so there he come forth and she come
[1:45:17] forth, but it was a period of time there
[1:45:20] because she couldn't she didn't Adam
[1:45:23] never saw her yet and she never saw Adam
[1:45:26] yet.
[1:45:29] Here's what it says. And made he the
[1:45:31] woman and brought her unto the man. If
[1:45:35] we go to Exodus 19,
[1:45:40] Moses said, "I've carried you on." God
[1:45:42] said through Moses, "I've carried you on
[1:45:44] eagle's wings and brought you to
[1:45:46] myself." Who brought who to himself? I
[1:45:50] brought you to myself. And when Eve met
[1:45:54] Adam or Mrs. Adam met Mr. Adam, Mr. Adam
[1:45:58] said, "She's bone of my bone and flesh
[1:46:00] of my flesh. She's me."
[1:46:06] &gt;&gt; So what happened when they opened the
[1:46:09] book in this hour? What happened? See
[1:46:11] out of a out of the second Adam come Eve
[1:46:14] come Mrs. Adam Mrs. Jesus Christ.
[1:46:18] The book is opened and she comes to her
[1:46:21] position. She awakens. This is who I am.
[1:46:24] This is my positive position.
[1:46:28] And God said himself, rising of the sun,
[1:46:32] she is him.
[1:46:35] Adam said, "She is me. She's bone of my
[1:46:39] bone, flesh of my flesh. And I'll call
[1:46:41] her woman because she come out of me.
[1:46:44] and she has a womb to bear my life.
[1:46:48] Amen.
[1:46:50] All right, I went through that pretty
[1:46:52] fast. That's a message in itself.
[1:46:59] Okay, I'm closing now.
[1:47:03] When a when a man now may I pass this to
[1:47:06] you? When the supernatural comes in,
[1:47:09] that's the mind of Christ.
[1:47:12] &gt;&gt; Yes. Seventh seal paragraph 35. When the
[1:47:16] supernatural comes in, underline in in
[1:47:19] where
[1:47:22] many see the supernatural. Many see it.
[1:47:24] Many are still under working under the
[1:47:26] gifts. Many are are are praising the
[1:47:29] Lord and and and having all kinds of
[1:47:31] emotions. And I believe in that. And I
[1:47:33] believe in praising the Lord. And I
[1:47:34] believe rejoicing. And they're all doing
[1:47:37] that. And under the same Holy Spirit
[1:47:39] I've got. they have.
[1:47:46] But there's a difference between the
[1:47:47] bride and I'm not saying who's under
[1:47:50] that and who isn't. I'm just saying
[1:47:51] they're there. We know that. Brother
[1:47:53] Brandham said this. This is a mystery
[1:47:55] that had to be should be spoken on and
[1:47:57] preached about.
[1:47:59] Amen. It's what he said. And and and so
[1:48:03] we see then that it comes back to the
[1:48:06] word itself. The word
[1:48:10] made way for the word himself to come
[1:48:12] right down in perfection. Back to that
[1:48:15] word again. All right. Now,
[1:48:22] now you're coming. See, the bride's been
[1:48:24] coming and is coming into perfect faith,
[1:48:26] perfect perfection that cannot fail.
[1:48:28] That faith never fails. And so, when a
[1:48:31] man lives by faith and walks by faith, I
[1:48:33] mean substance faith, substance faith.
[1:48:36] Revel Hebrews 11:1 faith is the
[1:48:38] substance and it's the evidence. That's
[1:48:41] why I said it's the evidence of things
[1:48:43] not seen. All right? He is isolated from
[1:48:46] the entire world and becomes a new
[1:48:48] creature in Christ. There now you're
[1:48:50] getting into bride material. You're
[1:48:52] getting into rapturing condition.
[1:48:55] Amen. I'll just leave that. That's a lot
[1:48:58] of quote I could read, but I'll pass it.
[1:49:02] Jesus lived in a world no one knew
[1:49:04] about. He was an odd person. a world of
[1:49:06] perfect faith in the perfect God in
[1:49:08] which he was. And the bride is walking
[1:49:10] in a perfect faith in the perfect God of
[1:49:12] what she is.
[1:49:15] It's exactly the same which he was. He
[1:49:18] lived in perfect faith of a Christian.
[1:49:20] If we lived in a perfect faith, see, and
[1:49:24] that's the way with all believers,
[1:49:26] they're a mystic as he was a mystic.
[1:49:28] I'll bypass some of this. And he was
[1:49:30] talking in riddles. They didn't
[1:49:31] understand him. And many think the
[1:49:33] prophet spoke in riddles. But he did
[1:49:35] that for a purpose.
[1:49:37] You know the brother said he did that to
[1:49:41] thin down his crowd.
[1:49:44] &gt;&gt; He spoke it in a way that some would
[1:49:46] leave some would ponder.
[1:49:48] He said that if you're interested in
[1:49:49] knowing where unveiling of God. Okay.
[1:49:52] But he said it but the bridal discerned
[1:49:54] the difference. They discern it just
[1:49:56] like Peter did. Where would we go? Thou
[1:49:59] hast the words of life. Okay.
[1:50:06] I'm happy today to be one of them being
[1:50:08] identified by the word which is Christ.
[1:50:11] Being identified
[1:50:14] identified with his word which is him.
[1:50:16] If I'm in Christ I am his word for he is
[1:50:18] the word. Therefore all that he was I
[1:50:21] am. And all that I am he was. Amen.
[1:50:25] Being dead in him we are identified with
[1:50:27] him. What he is I am.
[1:50:32] Amen. Amen.
[1:50:34] Could you compare a Christian today with
[1:50:36] them Christians long ago? How the
[1:50:37] disciples walked in the power of the
[1:50:39] spirit, moved by the Holy Ghost, just a
[1:50:42] prisoner. I preached the other night, a
[1:50:44] prisoner to the word and will of God. He
[1:50:46] couldn't even move until God moved him.
[1:50:48] Wouldn't you like to see a church rise
[1:50:50] like that?
[1:50:51] Let me tell you what he said. She's got
[1:50:53] to and she will. And I say, that's true.
[1:50:56] &gt;&gt; Amen. We see it. 63 years down the road,
[1:51:00] we see it. I know it's true. Amen.
[1:51:03] Then you know, if you abide in me and my
[1:51:06] word in you, then you know who you are.
[1:51:09] And this is where he said, "We need a
[1:51:10] going back to the desert." He said, "Now
[1:51:14] she's going, she's going back." Brother
[1:51:16] Brham said, "She'll go back. She's on
[1:51:18] her road now. She'll make it. She'll be
[1:51:20] there." And brother Brandham said down
[1:51:23] here, he said, "Now, don't try to
[1:51:24] manufacture something." And we've tried.
[1:51:27] We strained. We've we've paid. We've
[1:51:29] labored. And we had until we had no
[1:51:32] voice and try to manufacture something
[1:51:34] and soup up something and all these
[1:51:35] things find it to be a total failure. We
[1:51:38] need a going back to the desert, right?
[1:51:40] Yes, sir. Camp meetings and struggles.
[1:51:42] Why not just give up?
[1:51:46] That's what you ought to do. See, go
[1:51:49] back.
[1:51:51] Give up.
[1:51:53] What's the words going back? I just read
[1:51:55] it. Going back where? back to the word.
[1:51:58] She's going to be going back. She's
[1:52:00] going, Other words, she's going back to
[1:52:01] what she was in the beginning. She'll be
[1:52:04] here at the end.
[1:52:06] Amen. Amen.
[1:52:09] Praise the Lord. Do you love him?
[1:52:14] Amen.
[1:52:17] We are remember Balum's teaching. We're
[1:52:20] We are the same. Brother Brandham said,
[1:52:21] I'll just leave you with this.
[1:52:24] We are not the same. You are a separated
[1:52:26] people, holy unto the Lord, dedicated to
[1:52:29] the word and the spirit of God to bear
[1:52:32] fruit of his promise in this day. And
[1:52:36] you're not of them. I know that's awful
[1:52:38] strong, but that's the truth just the
[1:52:40] same. Dedicated to a service in this
[1:52:43] last day. Come out from among it. Amen.
[1:52:47] Amen. Thank the Lord. Let's stand
[1:52:48] together.
[1:52:52] Sorry that I took a little overtime in
[1:52:54] your thinking.
[1:52:56] But God thought to finish it. So, so I'm
[1:53:01] thankful that you've had patience.
[1:53:05] Let's just bow our heads. Heavenly
[1:53:08] Father, we thank you for the word of
[1:53:10] this hour in this day that we have been
[1:53:12] open to us. The book has been opened,
[1:53:15] Lord. The purpose of Calvary. That was
[1:53:18] the purpose, Lord. The full redemption's
[1:53:20] come forth. He bought us. Now he had to
[1:53:22] claim what he had bought and redeemed
[1:53:24] and the full redeeming, the full
[1:53:26] redemption. Lord, we receive it and we
[1:53:29] see it. And it's through that precious
[1:53:31] blood that we are redeemed. We are we
[1:53:33] are bought. We are your prisoners. We
[1:53:36] are prisoners of yours. We are your
[1:53:38] property, your possession. We give thee
[1:53:40] thanks, Lord. Let these words go deep
[1:53:43] into every heart. Those that have ears
[1:53:45] to hear will hear what the spirit
[1:53:47] they'll hear what the spirit and the
[1:53:49] bride say. And so, Father,
[1:53:52] this was on my heart. I've delivered. I
[1:53:55] believe what you had in my heart to
[1:53:56] believe to deliver, not knowing even how
[1:53:59] it would be delivered, but I believe
[1:54:00] you've delivered it. Now, you bless it
[1:54:02] now and have blessed your word. Continue
[1:54:04] to bless your word here, veiled behind
[1:54:07] skin. In Jesus Christ's name we pray.
