trip going and being part a witness of the wedding brother jake's daughter shannon and a lovely time for jerry and i to be together and um no place like home though amen so good to be here tonight amen and uh brother sergey shared a just a lovely little video of i'm pretty sure it must be the church in danesque uh but the believers there and and uh so just definitely keep him in your prayers for all the things that are happening you know and things that are necessary to take care of and and each and every one missing brother ivan sister nadia tonight i don't know maybe maybe you know where they're at but i don't but anyway just uh each and every one that's a part of the assembly we just just want to keep them up in prayer amen let's just stand and go into the word tonight just want to be kind of timely a lot of things that um we want to preach on i want to it doesn't really fit into my original age-old proverbs but uh these things are are you know kind of you might say coming out of um those studies uh that they just kind of keep speaking so tonight i'd like to speak uh a key to the door amen and um you will find as we get a little farther in the service this is actually a message brother branham preached and and uh just inspired by what i'm studying in that and how it just reflects uh in in our lives uh that certain things you know are a key to us and uh uh it's kind of ironic and i'll share that a little later in the service today that even while i was thinking these last few days and and uh you know studying towards this um had a very event today happened to me just just happened and i'll share that with you in in just a little bit amen key to the door amen let's turn in first corinthians uh very familiar scripture to you uh that uh we have uh no doubt all of us read many many times um and uh uh just um still speaks to us right the word just is always speaking amen this message is just always speaking it's not a message of some day gone by where we're just reciting things it was spoken by now mind how i say this by a man that others say is not and we say is if you understand what i'm saying we're not just reciting words it has come so alive to us that what we read on the page resonates down in our soul that this is truth this is life sister jerry uh just shared a blip of a quote i almost just spontaneously added it into the service but brother branham's saying uh that you know the reason satan can't deceive the very left you see he gets a little of it here and he gets a little of it here but he can't get it all together and so he won't deceive the elect because something has stirred into the heart of the elect that is is a recognition of who she is and i i would use this kind of earthly example that you have a young lady uh she gets married and uh um we would have to stop and say there's an issue if one year two years three years later she stops and says now who am i doesn't remember who she is see we'd say okay she has amnesia and this bride is recognizing who she is and brother branham you know a quote we might almost say is famous he says you know when she recognizes who she is she'll become that invincible army and saints that's not something far off in the future that's not something like a pie in the sky thing that we're just hoping oh when will this happen it is happening and this this bride is coming to a place that she is stalwart she's faithful she's unmovable amen first corinthians second chapter starting with the fifth verse that your faith should not stand in the wisdom of men but in the power of god i say amen to that how be it we speak wisdom among them that are perfect yet not the wisdom of this world nor the of the princes of this world that come to naught but we speak the wisdom of god in a mystery even the hidden wisdom which god ordained before the world unto our glory so you look at this my brother and sister because it's not really my focus but i want to just speak on it just real quick this hidden wisdom see this is what god is revealing this is as we would often times say is revelation but i want you to catch this now we would not expect our young children to understand trigonometry are you studying that kind of stuff vika not yet okay i just say that for an example see we wouldn't expect a a young student to be in trigonometry but the foundational stones are being laid that are bringing to the day that she will or all of our young people will study something of that form and so the steps have to be put in place you can't draw a child from the cradle and then tell them now figure this out this is what god's doing this hidden mystery my brother and sister is not someone coming as it were and writing it out on a chalkboard that we can look at and say oh there's the mystery the mystery is being revealed because we are part of that mystery amen we can't say that we are the whole mystery right because the prophet of god says that uh we are a part of him and he is a part of us and the two parts make the whole amen isn't that beautiful i love that but we speak the wisdom of god in a mystery even the hidden wisdom which god ordained before the world and to our glory which none of the princes of this world knew for had they known it they would not have crucified the lord of glory but as it is written i hath not seen nor ear heard nor have entered into the heart of man the things which god hath prepared for them that love him but god hath revealed them unto us by his spirit for the spirit searcheth all things yea the deep things of god for what man knoweth the things of a man save the spirit of a man which is in him even so the things of god knoweth no man but the spirit of god now we have received see i love how this is put because really if we accept the word as it was given to us it is speaking in a past tense we are not looking at that saying someday right before the rapture god's going to pour one last burst of revelation out to the bride so shall have faith enough to take a rapture no my brother and sister this is being birthed as it were in the bride of christ right now day by day now we have received can we say amen not the spirit of the world but the spirit which is of god that we might know the things that are freely given to us of god which things also we speak not in the words which man's wisdom teaches but which the holy ghost teaches comparing spiritual things with spiritual and let me elaborate real quick here sorry to keep you standing but my brother and sister without the spirit of god all we can do is approach these things from intellect from learning brother branham i'll jump ahead of myself a little bit brother brown says you'll never figure these things out by some casual study of the word of god you can't just say i'm going to study my bible i'm going to read what this commentary is and this commentary and all of these and i'll get this figured out it won't work but the natural man receiveth not the things of the spirit of god for they are foolishness unto him neither can he know them because they are spiritually discerned but he that is spiritual judgeth all things yet he himself is judged of no man for who hath known the mind of the lord that he may instruct him i just i i just never tire of this scripture but we oh i could almost just jump up and shout right now but we have the mind of christ oh hallelujah heavenly father we just thank you today lord your love your grace your mercy father lord just how we can't even hardly sing of these things father but our heart becomes tender lord we just are moved father not just by a realm of emotion but father by the great presence of you and our life and how lord we love you for what you've done and father we just want to give our part back to you give you praise give you glory give you honor lord once again father just lift up every one of these needs and lord just several needs in this assembly lord that are very strong upon my heart father you know them and i just ask you to touch them in the precious name of jesus christ amen you may be seated now as we would look here tonight i would just like to just give a reminder my brother and sister if we hold to the scripture if we have not let something come in that has anointed us with a spirit of future tense uh but if we have held on to the word of god and and uh embraced it for what it says uh never forget we have the mind of christ that is what the word in this hour was sent to do was to bring us from all the confusion bring us from all of the shadowy figures that were out there one saying this one saying that you know i i won't tell you what scripture to do but if you'd like a little homework just pick some of the what we would consider foundational scriptures and just go online and type those in and ask you know the search engine for commentary and you will find things that uh just directly conflict with each other things that are so convoluted as things that that just you no wonder the world's in the condition it is and uh reminds me of one time listening um while i was in a tractor uh on the radio and the uh catholic uh bible's answer hour and uh this man called in and says uh you know i i thought i'll tell you what i thought i thought maybe this man had encountered a message believer because he says now you know i i haven't been on fire catholic but it's still the foundation my faith but i'm working with this individual who is talking to me about prophets and talking to me about end time scripture and talking to me about things like acts 2 38 and uh talking to me about all of this and and you said i it troubles me because when i ask him questions he has answers and he says i'm calling you today because i i want to settle this confusion and so why what about and he names off several questions what about this this this and this and so this man that was the the man on the catholic answer hour is there and he starts going in uh to this deal and takes quite a lengthy uh discourse and as he he winds up his discourse uh he kind of all cheer he says uh well i'm so glad i could uh you know speak to you about this and then there's a dead silence and the man's voice comes on and says you didn't answer even one of my questions you see there was somebody that you know not to look at the critical side but there was someone who was caring about his soul enough to look into this and and you know one thing that struck me was is this man when i talk to him he has answers and i say my brother and sister we have the answer we might not be scholars but we have the answer because the mystery is not been revealed to us it's been revealed in us amen the very life of jesus christ is being manifested and we'll read some things here in a little bit kind of reinforcing that now you know we look at this and i want to just bring this up because i found this to be a very encouraging little quote i was looking into another thought as it were and i just i'm just sharing this it's not necessarily in line with what we're talking about tonight but i just liked it and yes i cherry-picked it so if anybody hears this and says it looks like brother paul is cherry-picking quotes we all do you imagine if we wanted to draw from two or three thoughts that we would be six or eight hours while we go through every bit of the the the sermon or the whatever but look at this but god's little group is his bride hallelujah don't that just make your heart happy we're not a sideline amen god didn't just say you know what i've got these people they're doing their very best they're reading and they're studying and they're praying and they're trusting but they're a sideline no sir god's little group is his bride centered on that word by not leaning to the writer leaning to the left not not getting some perspective over here that we have to just be all emotional to have it or over here that we must be all scholarly to have it or uh we must uh you know set under a certain ministry as it were i'll tell you the ministry we need to sit under and that's the ministry of the holy ghost amen because he uses who he chooses to use amen so let's just get under the ministry of the holy ghost and then whoever god uses to speak to us will be sufficient amen centered on that word may the dear heavenly father ever keep you and this is the word i actually looked up stabilized well the dear heavenly father ever keep you stabilized right there don't you never move from that word so i i think we can take this um this is uh you know april of 65. i think we can take this as as a a a a anchor point as it were that he's he's telling us don't ever move from the word if there's something comes along and with uh this little quote that jerry sent me you know satan's gonna come you see what he's trying to do he tries to come in and get us to get caught up on one little idea or ideology or one little thing over here and then if he can get us off center and get us into a certain little thought then the door is open and he can magnify or work on that but if we as sons and daughters of god never move from the word if we're always just come right back to the center of the word amen satan's got nowhere to get to us because what happens is is the word is the only thing we're resting on we're not resting on our own ability our own intellect or on whatever reminds me brother doug baker down in tucson this was shared with me one time a brother was talking to brother doug baker and and uh he said you know i just don't understand why why people don't get this he says you know it's not rocking science and and brother doug was a rocket scientist and and he goes you know it's actually closer to rocket science than you think because in rocket science you have to first build the rocket and it has to be done right according to the plans and it has to be done and he explains this out you know and i always thought that was a little bit humorous right because somebody's just uh verbiage would be ah it's not rocket science but really think about it saints it really is rocket science because if we deviate from the plan amen remember years ago sadly enough one of our our uh uh space shuttles blew up because somebody didn't put an o-ring incorrectly so millions of dollars and i don't know seven eight nine lives because someone didn't follow the directions and put an o-ring in correctly when that o-ring blew out it allowed oxygen to be sucked into a place that oxygen wasn't supposed to be and that peroxide whatever that they were using for jet fuel when it comes in contact with oxygen explodes so it was something so simple so i i hope that you know kind of spoke to you we just want to say centered on the word amen we want to be stabilized there hallelujah now to when we look at this uh to know that the mind of christ is to have the correct revelation of the word right so god will never take us or draw us away from his own word so when we say you know i've got the mind of christ that is us understanding the revelation of the word in the hour that we live in now this gives us i'm using these words interchangeable and i hope that's all right with you tonight but he gives us wisdom but we can also term that is revelation because once we really see the opening of the word that is wisdom as it were that we then understand how this applies to us in the day that we're living and i didn't want to go into politics tonight but several things that have just happened in the last few days is just uh speaking out to me my brother and sister that that these things that we see in the scripture things that were prophesied are coming to pass they don't even make the headlines of the world news they don't even make any of this but it's coming to pass it's all just like the move of god is most the time it's out of sight kind of out of mind it's not it's not catching the the attention of the people but still it is clearly coming to pass and so in that we recognize that this will be such that one day they will say hey wasn't elias supposed to come but he did come but he didn't show up on cnn he didn't show up on the front page he didn't we were too preoccupied i hope you catch this and then we'll move on we were too preoccupied with a southern border we were too preoccupied with inflation now having broached 25 growth in eight months or seven months or whatever it is see we're too preoccupied that didn't stop it from coming to pass see that's satan's little thing he's doing is we get to looking here we're looking to hear and all of this is happening and it will be just as it was what was not elias supposed to come so he gives us wisdom which is revelation my brother and sister this is not just general knowledge that's where i got ahead of myself brother branham said this wonder can't come just by a study of the scriptures you can't just pick up a bible and commentary and look through this and come up with the correct conclusion it takes a a knowledge a wisdom of god which is in this revelation so through this wisdom revelation we then have a key amen and what it is is god is giving to you and i it doesn't matter our age our young people it's their don't say oh well when i get older no it right now is just as good a time to get the key as any time in your life in fact it's better satan works as we get older it's harder for us to break certain things in our life and so it's as a young person uh just uh let it be part of your everyday cry to the lord lord i desire this key i desire to possess what is necessary for me to see who i am amen we have now in the united states one of the greatest psychological wars going on and it is called an identity crisis and so we have now uh just uh i won't get sidetracked to this but we have now a place where people are teachers in schools they might be in their 20s 30s 40s 50s they themselves have an identity crisis and so they feel compelled to pass that same identity crisis on to the students that are in their classes so because they have never really found who they are and unless they cry out to the lord they never will amen this is not just about gender it's not just about those things my brother and sister it's about who we really are all the rest of this is satan's smoke screen for the reality of finding out who we really are amen so we come and through revelation through wisdom uh we find the key and in this sermon right here and i would encourage you to read it or listen to it it's just a very good a strong foundational message sermon that was given he says now in hebrews the 11th chapter i got a great string of them wrote down here of these heroes of faith it was the key to the door that stopped the mouth of lions right it wasn't a frantic man's prayer my brother and sister that stopped the mouth of a lion it was someone who possessed the key amen it was the key faith see there's the key to the door that stopped the mouth line it was the key faith that unlocked the prison houses it was faith the key of faith that quenched the violence of fire escape the edge of the sword brought the dead back to life again it was faith the key of faith in the living god that hand that man that woman who can take that key of faith they can unlock every promise of god made see this is not confined to a ministry this is not confined to us looking to brother branham we respect that we hold them to the highest regard amen we we just i i look for the day to be able to stand before him as a son of god and say thank you for what you have given to us but my brother and sister this promise amen this word is a covenant because between god almighty our lord jesus christ and you and i amen we don't have a second or third or fourth person to go through we don't have a man that's an intercessor we don't have as it were in the flesh a high priest amen this is something god has given to us amen and we can unlock these promises we don't have to look to someone else and say oh they've got a key our pastor's got a key we'll we'll just wait till the pastor unlocks this no we have a key yes who can take the key of faith they can unlock every promise god made but if you haven't got that key you're just pragging and i was going to spend a moment and i got kind of distracted i don't guess i've ever heard the word progging before is it what search okay somebody's looked it up you're just progress you'll never unlock it you'll beat against it because this key any correct made key has levers on the inside the lock and it takes a certain form a certain shape of them keys to turn those levers and just one little lever out of the way will mess the whole thing up isn't that uh interesting you know because as we look about that my brother and sister it's it's just so interesting therefore i believe the full gospel every word of god that turns the power of god loose that turns his blessings to the people is the key to the door that unlocks it but oh those great heroes those prophets a great men of the bible that have that key that's the reason they could stop the mouth of lions quench the violence of fire escape the edge of the sword bring the dead back to life and do all kinds of miracles is because they held that key and they knowed it worked because it was a scripture-born key i love that my brother and sister you and i possess a key this evening can you say amen we possess a key why because that little quote that i read earlier i said that just turned it is because god not because somebody preached it to you not because somebody said you got to get balanced and centered on the word you need to get stabilized it's something god is doing in us amen it is not that we we do this to conform to a certain creed or ethic of our church it is just happening all i can say is thank you lord it is happening we are coming to a place that we find ourselves we look this way and if god corrects us then we move we don't say no no i'm going to continue i'm going to continue to go down the way i'm going we become tenderized to the moving of the holy spirit and if he says no you went too far left or too far right we we say yes lord now show us the center once again take me right back to the word and you see what it is is we are being stabilized in this scripture-born key and because that word is now in control of our life you know it's interesting um uh we were over in oregon one time there with brother rich and sister charity and and uh they took me to a place and we were looking at a uh wasn't a leader it was citation and um you know it was so funny uh how that god just dealt with me i'm just there to admire this fancy jet that this guy flies and and um you know it's so interesting so um he had silas get out of the plane silas boy he was just enjoying sitting in this cockpit of this state-of-the-art plane and he had silas get out and go and put his hand on the metal case that holds the fire extinguisher and he put his hand on there and then he said come back silas and silas like hurry goes oh you don't need to hurry my brother and sister in the infrared landing system of this airplane that handprint the heat from that handprint was just as clear as a handprint before you and it stayed there forever and he says this is what struck me he says this infrared deal you come landing in the fog you can't see anything but if the lights on the runway were ever turned on that night the heat from that shows up just as though the light is shining so sensitive now i want to take you what struck me the holy spirit so faithful to you and i in our worst days struggling wondering if we love ourself if anyone loves us if god loves us anywhere the hand of god has touched our life the holy spirit can guide you right back to that place it's not i'm too far gone he said when they first bought that plane he actually had the owner they did a demonstration one night and the plane has ils on it and they turned off the landing the the runway lights and the plane was ils and not only were they coming in on the glide scope but he said he's looking out there and every light as it comes down to the runway there's no lights on but every light was though it was still shining and i'm telling you in the darkest of times which we are living the power of god is visible to the bride of christ it has never and it will never satan thinking i'm blocking this all out i'm putting darkness over the earth i'm smothering all truth on the earth but where the holy spirit's ever been god's enlightening to the bride of christ it's so real to her god's revealing that to her and while the whole world has taken a compromised position this bride in this darkness can just move right to the center of the word and continue on i hope that made sense to you amen i remember it just stirred my heart i thought praise the lord praise the lord satan commits to you and i in the flesh it looks like the lights are going out but to god it's like don't worry i've touched you i've touched the world you live in right creating your own atmosphere i've touched the world you live in i've touched your life and it is all visible and i will reveal that and you will not lose your way in laodicea hallelujah now if i'm pragging with a creed key i don't know what it's going to do if they say my church teaches this i hope we don't ever use that as a fallback i don't know about that but when the bible teaches it i hold the key of faith in my hand or in my heart that says that's god's word that'll quench the violence of fire it'll unlock the healing for the sick it'll unlock salvation to the lost i have come to the door and everything's in his name whatever you do in word or dude indeed do it all in his name knowing that the key that you got is faith now saints you don't have to lift a hand you don't have to say a word but i believe i kind of understand human nature enough sometimes we get these feelings i don't have enough faith how are you going to get more faith the word the answer is right there right cometh by hearing the word of god but if you ever come to a place that satan's just beating on you and you think i don't have enough faith don't despair don't sit down and cry don't don't you know just have a pity party just go get centered back up on the word and let it stabilize you because i this is just a paul opinion okay don't make a big deal out of it i think we have misunderstood faith i think i'm looking at people that faith is in action every single day of your life i look at a people that faith is what is stabilizing you and that's the reason you haven't been washed away with the tide of unbelief in the day we live in it's faith that held you when you felt like you couldn't do this when you couldn't you couldn't make it no more further when you say i can't do this i just got a prayer request from a brother for his grandson today and his grandsons breaking up cracking up saying i can't do this any longer i can't do this any longer and in the native world my brother and sister that means the devil's telling him kill yourself kill himself nothing matters kill yourself it's the devil's language but you see faith is here it's what's stabilizing us it's not i i have an understanding of the message of the hour no it's god in you it's this word down deep in the heart and soul that just holds you when all is dark and to realize that oh i hope you catch this that god has touched your life and it's visible i don't care about the darkness he's touched you and it's visible hallelujah denominational key i don't know what it'll do but if it's scriptural key it unlocked because god said so now oh no wonder they could stop the violence of fire so forth they had the key now god's first nod to one of those prophets nothing could stop them he didn't have to do like he does to me sometime wow hope i don't get accused of criticizing the prophet by reading this he didn't have to do like he does to me sometimes pound it over and over oh okay we're good we're good and perhaps you we balanced it out the prophet god's like god this has to pound it pound it pound it oh wait just like you two i hope not but keep telling me go do this and then you'll stumble along then go do this i know he's not talking to any of you tonight amen then go do this and go back and do it again you didn't do it right just one little nod just they could just feel the spirit tell them it's the thing to do and nothing's going to stop them now i want to ask you tonight i hope i'm not just too homegrown tonight for you do god ever just like deal with your heart and you don't even know why you're doing what you're doing you just feel to pick up a phone you feel to just do something i don't want to go into a detail that you just feel to do it and yet some might say well we don't go by feelings well i'm sorry i do i do because the holy ghost comes down and moves upon us and something inside of us because of the way god created us we have no explanation and we just do it and find out that what we did was the will of god it was the desire of god but he had a vessel that he could move amen it's not really a move of god if we have a d9 caterpillar and a great big trackhoe and all these things and god's over there saying okay i'll move you that's not god moving my brother and sister god is stirring the very very feathery heart heartstrings of the hearts of sons and daughters of god because this is the kind of relationship we're moving into well praise the lord i got myself lost here and go back and do it again you didn't do it right boy i'm telling you i've i've heard that one just a little nod just could just feel the spirit tell them it's the thing to do nothing's going to stop them brother they they stopped the mouth of lions they escaped the edge of the sword they quenched fire they done everything just a little nod from god because they held the key in their hand that great faith they've done things for god because nothing will stop them oh glorious i'm going to ask you tonight my brother and sister was there lightning was there thunder was the writing on the wall that caused daniel to open the shutters and just do what he always did no he had to pray he had to express who he was and i can see daniel the world would have expected him to be clawing at the at the rocks the stones and don't throw me in there no i don't want to die don't do this and how it must have disturbed even the guards when a man yes in his heart would have trepidation i'm about to be thrown in a den with very hungry lions but he didn't cry he didn't weep he didn't scream he didn't compromise make a plea agreement why if this is how i'm supposed to go praise the lord and if god wants me to live i'll live it's very simple in that sense my brother and sister but it's the flesh that is holding us back from these things it's the flesh sometimes keeps us from worshiping god like our heart really is crying out to and so we are then caught in this this realm of the flesh because the flesh is satan's tool to keep us from taking the key and applying the key hey oh my because nothing stopped them oh how glorious amen now let me find where i'm at now this is something that happened to me today i never have really liked packing a bunch of keys but it's become necessary in my life and today the day is finished i'm going over and it's my habit i went to the office and the door was unlocked so i reached in i turned the little click on the knob i closed the door i reached in my pocket i glance down and there is the key for the door of the office same key uh and and the same brand of lock as the shop is and i thought i grabbed the right key and i reached out and i slid a key into the lock but it wouldn't turn and i looked down and it was a key to an entirely different building an entirely different brand of lock but it slid in there oh i hope you guys are with me tonight i'm not being critical i want to make a point i believe the message and it slid right in there but i want you to unlock the promises i don't want you to say praise the lord my key fits i've got a key to the lock no i want you to unlock the promise let's make sure we haven't settled for a key that fits but doesn't do anything i hope i hope that resonates with you it's not enough to say we have this message it's not enough to say i have this i have this my brother and sister there's promises of god that have been given to you and i and the key is right here not to have us boast that he fits in the lock but i want by the grace of god if there's needs in our lives needs in our children our marriages our own self to have a key that i can put in there and unlock that promise that i need see because they held the key in their hand that great faith they done things for god because nothing will stop them and when we recognize by experience that the key that i have in my hand fits the lock as it were of this promise of god amen as for me and my house oh my brother and sister not hoping not there in desperation jiggling the lock hoping it will work but a key with confidence we can insert into the lock and turn it hallelujah now i want you to catch this because it will become here in just a moment but look at this remember the key that unlocks also locks wherever you lose in my name amen and whatever you bind in my name so that same key we don't have to go find another key and say well you know there's certain things happening within the family within the church within whatever and the lord i want to bind this now i've got to find a key so i can make no it's same key same key hallelujah amen so i was a little amazed today to realize that the key to the green shop will fit in the office door which means it will fit in our other shop door but not even the same brand of lock probably the truth is they're all owned by the same company or something but it struck me because here i already have this on my heart to do this and i i'm serious i stopped and i said thank you lord this was not just a a you know hey this is how it might be but it struck home to me that this is entirely different shape it seemed but have you ever noticed my brother and sister brother i was talking about the pins and every pen has to be in its right place to unlock you realize all the valleys have to be there too so it's not just the high points it's the valleys and it's everything we've gone in fact you might say it's the very character of the key that's needed to unlock the things into our life and the key that worked for my life i hope you catch this now the key to work for my life won't work for you it won't work for you you've got to have your own key we can't just put a a basket or a bucket or something full of faith in the back of the church we've got to possess this ourself we've got to take a hold of this and i think sometimes now i don't mean to be critical but i think sometimes we have given our young people growing up in the message such a disadvantage because we've injected into their thinking into their minds then i was born i was raised in a message family in a message church and therefore all is well my brother and sister they're going to have their key you can't have another key they gotta have their key oh my now look i gotta keep going on i just was got so much here sorry smorgasbord tonight like the time now this all just struck my heart and that's why you'll find this all together it's one great big long quote and uh sorry i'm doing that and i just about didn't and uh but i'm doing it like a man one time that come up to an old brother that was a godly old man o prophet of god and he heard that man constantly testify constantly telling about the goodness of god and how that god was and what christ was and just going ahead speaking finally this young man was going to be ordained in the ministry so he come up to this certain old sage and he said to him sir i want to ask you a question and he said ask on young man he said does christ literally now i want you to catch this in the wrong context it would be like he's questioning him negatively you know but this young man something had stirred his heart so much he says does christ literally mean as much as you say it does i'm going to share something that's going to come across so wrong [Music] i hope you don't mind we were talking to a very sweet very pretty very sweet young lady i put the next day after the wedding and i got talking to her and i kind of steered the the topic or whatever to things of god this young lady was dressed in such a fashion i basically spent most of my time looking over was it would have been her left shoulder at the wall and it made my heart ache i didn't feel it was a time or place to change something but the way she was dressed was just atrocious and she looked at me and said yes it bothers me so much in the university because talking about christianity people say one thing and say what they believe and do something entirely different i'm telling you saints my heart broke i so wanted to say look can we grab a bible right now can i show you the way you're dressed right now and all of but you see sometimes the atmosphere's not right you can't do that my heart literally broke because this girl jumped into a child's spandex i think that'll be the kindest way i can put it right there and she was a mature young woman and yet see the spirit of the day is people say they're christians but really they're not and my heart broke right there because i was like can't you see can't you see but this is satan's camouflage this is what satan has done she she does her very best to live all the ordinances of the bible but missing those deals why because there's a key sisters i give you a compliment tonight young ladies i'll give you a compliment tonight it takes a key to be modest and holy and live it from the heart before the lord it don't just happen that's why you can cro close line religion preach it in the church oh don't dress like this don't do that you know people would be like well i know he was talking to her because this and he was talking to her because of this it won't work if there's no key it's got to be a key that unlocks that and when the key is unlocked it doesn't matter what the world says and how they ridicule or whatever you say no i've got a key i've got a revelation god himself after all i'm his amen he says i ask on let's see uh he means more to me than what i could ever have breath to speak there you are what was it he had found the key that young man said upon that if you claim these things and you say to me that they're as real as you then i want to know that same jesus in the same reality see that man's life it wasn't a preacher getting up you have to do this mark this do this follow this it was so real to him and when he spoke my brother and sister he was testifying of what he found after the key had unlocked the door what was it he know the old man had a hold of a key that he could unlock and could lock up oh hallelujah you know a key that locks unlocks two see you can loosen or bind that's right the same key that locks unlocks the key that unlocks can lock up that's exactly c because it works both ways how pitiful it is that the church has ever lost its vision of that what a sad thing it was when the church sold itself out to creeds as we've done today and now called to unite we've seen where the great roman hierarchy and then was going to meet now and they're going to change some programs i thought they didn't change but they're going to anyhow now i want to insert this my brother and sister if jesus christ is the same yesterday today and forever and that is revelation to us that is true mind of christ wisdom or revelation to us do you realize what we're saying when we say that this gospel that we believe can't change it cannot be molded to our culture and i'm going to say something direct because there's little things that filter around and i i'm not talking about people i hope you guys never think that i'm here beating on a person but i'm telling you my brother and sister i was called of almighty god to guard the door as it were of the sheep code and i'm not going to stand by while spirits come and go and people say and leave little hints and little words here and little subtle things there my brother and sister when you have people that have now not subtly but brazenly come to the place that they will promote to you things that were told to them and does not line up to the word and they brazenly promote that under the guise of he was with the prophet come on the prophet said now are we going to take what somebody says the prophet said or are we going to take what the prophet said see there's the real ground and there's the subtle side of it right because satan gets part of it here and so we have people taking and embracing certain things in the message i won't go into it tonight but they embrace certain things in the message that there is in one case a hundred and nine quotes where the prophet says differently but they are embracing an influence now you wonder why i get all wound up sometimes why i don't get wound up because i'm angry i get wound up because i'm almost in distress lord don't let these spirits spread don't let this take root don't let this become a normal because otherwise we don't really believe the message because the message will be the same yesterday today and forever prophet of god said this fell down as it were into the church on the day of pentecost we cannot unwind history go back and rewrite pentecost but it's promoted and it's accepted and it's amended and it splits churches oh that was all right hey man let's just keep going here that's where they left the key right there that's the reason the great miracle and signs are not done amongst the people today that they used to be they've lost the key yeah they know the door they know the door is there but the next thing is the key to open the door the treasures is behind the door once again i want to reiterate not just the fact that we have a key that will slide into the lock we've got to get beyond the door they're locked up out of sight from the unbeliever but the believer who has faith and can take the key of faith can unlock these doors yes sir one time here a few years ago i hope you guys enjoy this part this is not really part of my sermon but once i read it i just thought i have to share this one time here a few years ago there was a missionary brother and he felt he had a call to africa he was a young fellow wife and two children very pretty the young girls about seven eight years old a piece and this young fellow couldn't get away from it he was a minister he had a nice church in the country but he just couldn't get away from that call must go to africa and he prayed day and night he didn't want to go but god kept speaking to him you must go and finally come to a place till he a showdown where he must go so he went to the mission board of his church and he said god has called me to the mission fields way back in the jungles of rhodesia and in this jungle that's infested with malaria and fever and hot sun and plaguery or however you say that leprosy and all kinds of diseases back in this jungle uh be where he was going to make or take the rest of his life sold his home and all he had so the mission board wanted to test him and they said are you sure now and he said i'm positive they said to him sir you thought it was in this manner that you've got two pretty little girls and you've got a lovely young wife and if why don't you just go over and see how it is and then come back and he said no the lord told me oh it's so real aren't you glad you have that experience in your life that the things that god deals with you is so real it's not a vague i think i'm a christian i think i'm a son of god a daughter of god i think i'm going to serve him it's so real that we can say i'm going to it's real to me i don't want to leave my church and i don't want to leave my home i don't want to leave my church my people but the lord called me back there in that jungle and he said sir did you know your little girls could take yellow fever or black water fever and die overnight and to refer to different people that had lost their children the little fellows to take them back in there on diseases that they had no inoculation for and said think of leprosy of your pretty wife and your two little girls with leprosy and that hot sun and things that you've got to put up with said aren't you afraid in the danger of taking your children and wife in such a place i don't know maybe i'm just really off the rocker but my brother and sister we live in a world that right now we are beset by supposedly the world's most dangerous disease it seems to me this mission board and our government were anointed by the same spirit be afraid of this what if this happens what if that happens what is this what is this let us imagine some more this is not affecting you enough i love this response i say this just because of this and the missionary stood there the young fella in tears began to run down his cheeks he turned around and said my brethren my vision of god's call if god has called me to africa if god has called me to this message my children and family is more safer in africa than any place in the world what do we have to fear we serve a god who said we are part of him and he is part of us there's no separation there should be no fear people are like oh my i heard this the other day well you know brother so-and-so you know that covet got him no my brother and sister i'm sorry clovid's not sitting just be on the ether with his brother in his hand saying i got him it's almighty god said i will use a time i will use a season i will use whatever it is but i'm calling him home and he is not there wrapped up in covet he's wrapped up in jesus christ and people oh we become afraid of this i'm sorry i'm sorry i'm going to take the stance this young man had if i am in god's will grace tabernacle if we are in god's will there's no safer place for us than in his will hallelujah oh safer there than any other place on the face of the earth he had the key that's what it takes oh my he goes right on here i gotta hurry saints when you got the key there's no fear there's no doubt there's no question you don't have to ask anybody else about it you know exactly you've got it in your hands you know what to do amen you know what the score is you know the door is going to unlock you've checked the levers and you know it's strictly the right thing the door is going to fly open when you throw the key in it oh if the church only possessed the keys if the church only possessed the key of faith we could unlock any door any sickness any plague any case that there is it could be unlocked to us if we could only possess this key the man this man has had the key to his calling hallelujah i hope i've made a little sense to you tonight i'm just going to kind of move on here i have one last little quote i want to put up here amen now i had brother alex post the whole thing but really kind of starting right in here is more of the thought but dear god we thank thee tonight first for jesus christ our savior we thank thee because that he is the same yesterday today and forever we thank thee for people who believe that we're so glad that we have a god not just an imaginary god an imaginary idol an imaginary spirit there's nothing imaginary about it a true and living god who lives with us and in us and works through us why does this mean so much to you brother paul because i'm hearing the verbiage of people who are almost like saying the bible's an allegory they're oh i forgot to tell you yes they believe god sent a prophet but there are certain things they can't help themselves but voice that really tells me and i'm not trying to be critical saints but it tells me that somehow or another some of this has become imaginary not a reality to them the reality that we have should be in the spiritual sense right to discern the spiritual things you have to be spiritual that literally my brother and sister this probably starts some kind of firestorm but you need to believe god is in you so strongly that if you pricked your finger and the blood come out that that would be the blood of jesus christ not not some well that's my blood and i'm part of god and god's part of me and i'm his and i'm trying to separate this i'm drawing this line here that keeps a distance as it were between me because i'm just human and god know my brother and sister we should be so sold out that we know that every part and parcel of our being is god's and he's the one who said i'll take care of you that young man we just read that quote he had the revelation if i'm in the will of god i'm doing what god wants i've got no safer place we're so glad that we have a god not just an imaginary god an imaginary idol imaginary spirit there's nothing imaginary about it a true and living god who lives with us you know if we're talking about in the world of moral decorum when a man and a woman live together they're married he's living with us amen are you with me we're we're living together amen we're not living as fornicators or adulterers or anything else we're living with our husband amen he lives with us and in us and works through us not making a statue to god but we being living images look how real this is we got to get god out of the ether land he's not out there behind the eagle nebula somewhere in another galaxy he's right here dwelling in our midst because he's in us not making a statue to god but we being living images of god the holy spirit not speaking through a statue but speaking through a redeemed vessel god manifested in flesh how we thank thee for this the great pillar of fire following us or we following it rather for all the great manifestations of the same spirit doing the same work that it's always done when it come to earth what a consolation it gives us hallelujah amen brother alex if you just come praise the lord brother chris i'm doing better it's only two minutes till nine hallelujah hallelujah saints i just trust tonight there's something that you glean from this tonight to realize god's given us the key we don't have to sit back and say woe unto me he's given us the key now let's unlock some doors amen only you know you know i had brother he's a pastor he thinks maybe i'm too hands off maybe he thinks i should be coming in peeking over your back fence would that creep you out as brother paul showed up at your house you look out there he's looking but you know what i have confidence in you have confidence you've caught the revelation that god answers your prayers god hears your cry amen god wants you amen take the key oh sometimes that key seems so big can i handle this key you can handle it god's given you the authorities giving you the power saints let's start putting it in i want you to pick you know i've kind of half-heartedly i hate to admit that but tell the truth i half-heartedly follow dave ramsey you know the money guy [Music] don't go out here saints please hear me out don't go out here and tackle the biggest issue in your life and say now i'm going to prove god one way or the other [Music] don't do that you'll get discouraged before you run out of problems [Music] but i want you to stop and maybe there's just a little something that's besetting in your life i want you to just take that key and i want you to put it in there and i want you to unlock it and then remember what the prophet said what it unlocks it will also lock so take those littlest things and bind them in the name of jesus christ you know what will happen is it starts to move in your life and you see god actually answering now don't just sit back and expect a postcard and god say i i did this for you amen you've got to be there to be moved by that very gentle nudging that very gentle moving of the holy spirit and then take the key and move on to the very next thing in your life and unlock it or lock it and just keep doing that until as dave ramsey promotes in his program you'll wake up one morning debt-free well i'll tell you my brother and sister you say well brother paul we are debt-free our sins are forgiven that's right but some of you still have a temper and some of you still have little petty things in your life and some of you easily offended and some of you are easy to offend others and all these things say i'm not preaching down to you just take the key start dealing with it you know i mean i say this a little bit humor i think the way god created men and women sometimes our wives definitely need to have a big dose of grace because they live with us but sometimes y'all not so easy either so whatever it is take the key loose it or bind it the key works and god will answer your prayer and your faith will increase and when these things come in your life my brother and sister i've lost it i had some notes one time that was shared with me with a sister went out in her backyard and her child's floating face down in the swimming pool imagine it would be just like being struck struck so hard i mean it would just be like oh my she jumps in the pool she drags her baby out gets it on the deal there she calls 911 and she's there trying to remember you know it's like most of us in ninth grade or something she took a first date class and she's like oh my don't know what to do something come over and said pray she didn't do cpr she didn't do advance this or advance that she went to the throne of almighty god [Music] and when the ambulance or fire engine or rescue squad or whatever showed up she's sitting there with a living baby in her lap oh the skeptic can say well maybe he wasn't dead now the believer says god give her the key of faith and when the holy spirit nudged her and said pray for your baby god was there saying you pray i'll answer you pray and i'll perform this for you that's the kind of faith we need to have saints don't let satan rob you and say well i've got so many shortcomings of course you do you're human but just stand upon it never lose holds right the prophet of god says they lost the key let's not lose the key let's stand sing a song or two praise the lord i boasted that i was done before nine and i wasn't amen i am redeemed i've been bought with a price amen
