[35:52] sisters who
[35:53] have a true revelation of jesus christ
[35:56] in the day that we live in
[35:58] amen i just want to take just a moment
[36:05] to just make sure that we all have
[36:07] clarity
[36:09] starting officially i think it's friday
[36:14] saturday sunday you might call it the
[36:17] services on the mountain out of unity
[36:20] oregon
[36:21] and to all those that are able to come
[36:25] whether you're a camper or not i think
[36:28] there's a
[36:29] motel in prairie city and for those who
[36:32] are not able to come
[36:34] but would like to come on sunday
[36:37] i think it would be well worth the time
[36:40] for you to drive
[36:41] up there i don't know the exact amount
[36:44] of time i think it's actually a couple
[36:45] hours
[36:46] uh but uh just to make clear that
[36:51] everyone who desires to come obviously
[36:53] this is not a closed service
[36:55] and for those who can't uh
[36:59] make it there brother david will be
[37:01] preaching here
[37:02] in the tabernacle on sunday so we will
[37:05] have church here
[37:06] for those who are not able to go up
[37:08] there and uh
[37:10] i know my brother chris is hard and
[37:14] while this might catch some of us a
[37:16] little off guard
[37:17] this is something that's a burden on his
[37:19] heart that he would like if the lord
[37:21] would grant
[37:22] to do every year so maybe we come to the
[37:26] house of god to get converted from our
[37:28] old man
[37:29] and i hope you don't mind a moment of
[37:31] humor here but
[37:32] maybe some of you can be converted into
[37:36] and um so i believe we'll have a lovely
[37:39] time there on the mountain
[37:41] we're not going there just to goof off
[37:43] not going there
[37:44] some of you may take a fishing pole some
[37:46] of you may bring your hiking shoes
[37:48] whatever it might be
[37:50] but we want to go up there to just
[37:53] have a lovely time of fellowship
[37:55] together
[37:56] and to worship the lord so uh just
[38:00] the the times i don't know exactly if
[38:03] there was
[38:04] clarified times but i know there'll be
[38:06] uh saints there
[38:10] friday saturday sunday so whatever works
[38:12] for you
[38:13] so brother david has taken it upon
[38:16] himself
[38:16] and i appreciate that we had a lengthy
[38:19] conversation
[38:20] over uh the need to have the doors
[38:24] of the tabernacle open for those so we
[38:27] don't want to
[38:28] if you're not a camper you're shut out
[38:29] we want to leave that door open for each
[38:32] one to be able to worship this
[38:34] this weekend so um
[38:37] i i
[38:40] had one more announcement when you get
[38:46] over
[38:46] my age you should write things down
[38:50] well if the lord wants us to remember
[38:52] that um
[38:54] we certainly will so uh many needs my
[38:57] brother and sister oh i know what i was
[38:58] going to say brother
[39:00] brother jason and i had a laugh in the
[39:02] back room and
[39:03] to those of you that heard brother
[39:05] chris's wednesday sermon
[39:07] and he was talking about message
[39:08] traditions
[39:10] and i had quite a sense of humor over
[39:13] that because it struck me
[39:14] the very evening because sister jerry
[39:16] turned in an unspoken request and
[39:18] brother chris
[39:19] speaks about that he says you know now
[39:21] these message traditions we have
[39:22] unspoken requests
[39:24] and i i don't say this in defense of me
[39:26] but i just want you to understand
[39:28] that sometimes when the pastor says he
[39:30] has an unspoken request you should say
[39:32] thank you lord that it's unspoken
[39:34] because some of you
[39:35] i would be saying and i'm speaking about
[39:37] you and speaking about you
[39:39] and i'm speaking about you and i want
[39:41] god to come down and deal with you
[39:44] so i i just choose to leave it unspoken
[39:48] amen so i appreciated the point brother
[39:51] chris was making right we don't want to
[39:52] fall into ruts
[39:54] but i think there is a time for the
[39:56] unspoken request and
[39:58] and uh we should take them serious it's
[40:00] really the reason i bring this
[40:01] up don't just gloss over it and say well
[40:04] okay yeah that
[40:06] that's just something unstated um many
[40:09] times they're serious
[40:10] enough and many times they deal with you
[40:14] and so let's just hold those unspoken
[40:17] requests up just as important
[40:19] as though it was your request
[40:22] amen let's turn in our bibles this
[40:24] morning
[40:26] amen today is the fourth of july
[40:29] and my brother and sister there's many a
[40:31] man
[40:34] that died on a battlefield we have
[40:36] memorial day for
[40:38] those remembrances but for the liberty
[40:41] that we as a nation get to celebrate
[40:44] there is many a man died upon a
[40:46] battlefield to preserve that liberty
[40:49] and for the liberty that we have as sons
[40:52] and daughters of god
[40:55] many a man woman boy and girl
[40:59] has stood and faced the opposition
[41:02] and overcome it in the name of jesus
[41:05] christ
[41:06] so while we'll celebrate today the
[41:08] liberty we have as a people in a nation
[41:11] and you'll see how that satan is coming
[41:13] by prophecy to destroy the liberty of
[41:15] our nation
[41:17] he so much more so wants to destroy your
[41:20] liberty in jesus christ
[41:23] whether now this isn't just for young
[41:25] people but my brother and sister the
[41:26] spirit of the age
[41:28] is coming down and our young people face
[41:30] a special battle they go to the
[41:31] university they go to the high school
[41:33] they go to the middle school
[41:35] and satan's trying to erode their faith
[41:37] in god and displace it
[41:39] with something there a cynical attitude
[41:41] or a
[41:42] lackadaisical attitude and my brother
[41:45] and sister
[41:46] this liberty we have in jesus christ is
[41:49] worth fighting for amen
[41:52] don't give up keep fighting young people
[41:55] if the devil's been hammering on you
[41:57] don't give up keep fighting
[42:01] you young married couples amen tony
[42:04] reagan one time many years ago says you
[42:06] know
[42:06] when mothers have all them little babies
[42:08] and they spend time in the cry room and
[42:10] fussing with their children and whatever
[42:12] he said there's a
[42:13] time and i don't remember his exact
[42:15] words but it's like there's a span of
[42:17] time it's almost like our mothers are
[42:18] backslid because
[42:19] they're hardly hearing the preaching of
[42:21] the word taking care of your children
[42:23] but god has a special dispensation upon
[42:26] you
[42:26] because you're fulfilling the word amen
[42:29] and so he come and he sustained you in
[42:31] that time and
[42:32] i apply that to us whatever we're facing
[42:35] today
[42:36] don't give up just keep facing and claim
[42:38] the liberty we have in jesus christ
[42:41] because god's got a dispensation for you
[42:43] amen he will pour out what you
[42:45] need when you need it if you don't give
[42:48] up
[42:49] hallelujah amen let's turn our bibles
[42:52] this morning
[42:53] i want to speak to you on subjected
[42:57] to another will and uh you know sometime
[43:02] it's interesting hope your parents don't
[43:05] mind
[43:08] but it's interesting to watch the battle
[43:10] between the will
[43:11] of a mother and her child
[43:16] it's quite a contest sometimes you don't
[43:20] know who to root for
[43:26] but you'll find my brother and sister
[43:29] that the holy spirit the will of god
[43:34] will always take you into the will which
[43:36] is his worth that's right
[43:38] so when we look for the battle of the
[43:40] wheels if you say well brother paul i'm
[43:42] not sure
[43:43] well just take what your desire is back
[43:46] to the word of god and
[43:47] if it fits in the word pursue it
[43:51] if it doesn't fit in the word don't
[43:54] that's right we were talking one day
[43:56] just a remembrance of this talking one
[43:58] day about puzzles and
[44:00] i was not aware i think it was sister
[44:02] ruth shared this with me
[44:04] and have a puzzle that's got a picture
[44:06] on each side and
[44:08] it's the exact same cut but an entirely
[44:11] different picture on the other side of
[44:14] the piece
[44:16] it's now left to you and i to determine
[44:19] which side we want to reflect
[44:24] so you can put the peace in place
[44:28] destroy the whole picture that you can
[44:32] by the will of god put it in place
[44:34] and finish the picture that's right so
[44:38] we're here because the author and finish
[44:40] of our faith has come
[44:42] and he's not here to make us religious
[44:44] he's come here
[44:45] to make us sons and daughters of god
[44:49] hallelujah let's turn to ii timothy
[44:53] and uh we'll just take our context
[44:56] out of ii timothy the second chapter
[44:59] verses 19 through 26.
[45:02] and then god bless you brother bob
[45:05] sister joanne
[45:05] been thinking about you and just uh
[45:09] feel guilty that i don't come
[45:12] knock on your door but also i'm
[45:15] concerned because we
[45:16] go through the cycle of the cough snorts
[45:18] and sneezes at our house and
[45:21] we we don't want to inadvertently share
[45:23] that
[45:25] amen second timothy 2 19
[45:29] to 26 nevertheless the foundation
[45:33] of god standeth sure having this seal
[45:37] the lord knoweth them that are his
[45:40] amen and let everyone that nameth the
[45:43] name of
[45:44] christ depart from iniquity
[45:47] but in a great house there are not only
[45:50] vessels of gold
[45:51] and of silver but also of wood
[45:54] and of earth and some to honor
[45:57] and some to dishonor if a man therefore
[46:00] purge himself from these he shall be a
[46:03] vessel unto honor
[46:05] sanctified and meet for the master's use
[46:09] and prepared unto every
[46:13] i want to emphasize that every good work
[46:17] flee also youthful lusts but follow
[46:20] righteousness faith charity
[46:24] peace and with them that call on the
[46:26] lord out of a
[46:27] pure heart but foolish and unlearned
[46:30] questions avoid
[46:31] knowing that they do gender strifes and
[46:34] the servant of the lord must not strive
[46:38] but be gentle until all men out to teach
[46:41] patient in meekness instructing those
[46:44] that oppose themselves
[46:46] if god prayed venture would give them
[46:49] repentance
[46:50] to the acknowledging of the truth and
[46:53] that
[46:54] they may recover themselves out of the
[46:57] snare
[46:58] of the devil who are taken
[47:01] captive by him at his will amen
[47:05] heavenly father we ask you lord for your
[47:07] blessings upon the word today for your
[47:09] blessings upon this service
[47:11] father take these things that have been
[47:13] upon our heart lord
[47:15] apply them correctly to the needs of
[47:17] your people
[47:18] guide us we pray today in the name of
[47:20] jesus christ
[47:22] amen you may be feared
[47:26] now as i made comment there of the
[47:28] battle of the wills
[47:29] it is interesting my brother and sister
[47:32] that we see from
[47:33] the very birth of a child now the
[47:35] prophet of god talks about how that a
[47:37] child's only way to communicate a need
[47:39] is
[47:40] to cry to cry out and he expresses that
[47:44] that
[47:44] is also the way that a son or daughter
[47:47] of god expresses their need to god
[47:50] we don't want to be cold indifferent
[47:53] formal
[47:53] we don't want to approach god as though
[47:55] he was our
[47:57] i was thinking this brother manasseh as
[48:00] a personal
[48:00] shopper we don't want to come and say
[48:02] now lord i need you to go get this
[48:04] this and this for me my brother and
[48:06] sister but we need to learn to cry out
[48:08] from our heart
[48:08] to be able to express from the very
[48:11] depths of our heart
[48:12] the things that we desire and god says
[48:15] that he would answer the very desires of
[48:17] your heart give you the desires of your
[48:19] heart
[48:19] because one he knows my brother and
[48:21] sister that you
[48:22] having his heart will not be asking for
[48:25] something
[48:26] that is uh unnecessary as it were
[48:29] things that would be detrimental but
[48:31] your heart is crying to be closer to the
[48:34] lord and
[48:34] i believe we can say amen to that and so
[48:37] we see these children
[48:39] and the battle of the wills that is
[48:41] there and you know
[48:42] it is there that we find and and this is
[48:45] not going to be a lesson on parenting
[48:47] this morning but
[48:48] we'll find that when parents constantly
[48:51] give in to the will of their children
[48:53] they will raise a very headstrong and
[48:56] stubborn children
[48:58] that become headstrong and stubborn
[49:00] teenagers and adults and on into life
[49:03] and ultimately we realize my brother and
[49:05] sister that
[49:06] while we're not here to break the spirit
[49:08] of a child to make them
[49:10] some completely submissive you know um
[49:13] but it is it is that we need to realize
[49:16] there's a time
[49:17] that it's time for us to give in to the
[49:19] will
[49:20] amen whether it be of our parents uh or
[49:22] of the lord and
[49:24] so we see this and we see certainly in
[49:27] the day that we're living in
[49:28] satan's desire to exert his will on
[49:32] humanity the scripture says that there
[49:34] would come a day that they would call
[49:36] good
[49:36] evil and evil good and we find that is
[49:39] only satan exerting his will because
[49:43] whatever god said now my brother and
[49:45] sister sorry for quoting brother donnie
[49:47] but these things are upon our mind and
[49:49] you know brother donnie one time made a
[49:51] statement he says now
[49:52] look at how the world or the spirit of
[49:54] the world is he said if the word of god
[49:57] called and he uses a young sister for an
[49:59] example
[50:00] if the word of god called our sister
[50:02] gabriella to
[50:04] have her nose pierced her cheek pierced
[50:06] her lip pierced
[50:07] and her ears full of studs and for her
[50:10] head of a stud in her forehead
[50:12] and her hair to be purple then the devil
[50:14] would have her
[50:16] sitting here today with uncut hair
[50:18] dressed modestly
[50:19] looking like that you see that is what
[50:21] it is it's simply
[50:22] satan opposing the will of god and so
[50:25] it's not
[50:26] my brother and sister because look young
[50:27] people
[50:29] are they pretty studs through the nose
[50:33] the lip the ears the cheeks the
[50:36] weird colored hair look
[50:39] i don't want to sound carnal but i'm
[50:40] just a normal human
[50:42] i find nothing attractive
[50:46] about that so what is it there's an
[50:49] anointing that's there
[50:51] but that example my brother and sister
[50:53] if god called for uh
[50:54] our daughters of god to look like that
[50:56] then the satan would have him there with
[50:58] uncut hair long dress sitting in church
[51:01] because he's opposed to the will of god
[51:03] he's opposed to that
[51:04] and so everything that he's doing it's
[51:07] not relevant of what i want or what i
[51:09] feel
[51:09] but to look at the battle of the wills
[51:11] to see how it is
[51:12] that satan has come and in everything
[51:15] that god is doing satan
[51:17] is opposed to that and working against
[51:19] that amen
[51:20] and so as he goes to exert his will on
[51:23] humanity
[51:24] amen he has come to the place that he
[51:26] has pushed and he has
[51:28] influenced and he has brought the
[51:30] culture to such a place my brother and
[51:32] sister
[51:32] now you know i won't go into explanation
[51:35] on this but
[51:36] i i i look at things in a pretty broad
[51:39] view
[51:41] as far as when i'm studying to
[51:42] understand thoughts that i have and
[51:45] to express them and to pray over them of
[51:47] what i speak and don't speak
[51:48] and you know my brother and sister you
[51:50] look at this and and you'll find in the
[51:52] world today
[51:53] we have a lot of voices we have a lot of
[51:56] influence of people saying they're
[51:58] representing god
[51:59] and speaking for god and acting out on
[52:02] behalf of god
[52:03] but yet everything about them now this
[52:05] sounds judgmental but
[52:07] i don't mean it that way because it's
[52:08] what the word says right that's what's
[52:10] important and
[52:11] and so they're there saying i represent
[52:13] god and men with long hair
[52:15] i represent god and women with hair cut
[52:17] off i represent god and you have
[52:20] all of these different influences i
[52:22] won't go into all the explanation of it
[52:24] but you have all these influences but it
[52:27] is directly opposed
[52:29] i'm representing god but i'm opposed to
[52:30] his word
[52:32] see this won't work my brother and
[52:33] sister but the anointing of the day is
[52:35] so strong that people will say oh
[52:38] uh you know i know the bible forbids it
[52:41] but but
[52:42] you don't understand our sister that
[52:44] pastors our church is special
[52:48] what is it the word said there'd be a
[52:50] strong illusion in the day that we live
[52:52] in
[52:52] where they would call right wrong and
[52:53] wrong right and they would go on
[52:55] believing because every man is right in
[52:57] his own eyes and
[52:58] and they push into that and what we see
[53:01] is not against the individuals don't
[53:02] misunderstand me today
[53:04] we're not against the individual i have
[53:06] some friends that you guys might be
[53:07] shocked that i call them friends
[53:09] but my brother and sister it's the
[53:11] spirit of the day because satan is here
[53:13] slowly but surely pushing his will upon
[53:16] the people
[53:17] and the prophet of god said many times
[53:19] the problems our churches have is
[53:20] because the pastor doesn't have a
[53:22] backbone
[53:22] i ask you pray for me that i will have a
[53:25] backbone
[53:26] that i will stand on the word of god
[53:28] whether i feel popular or not whether i
[53:31] feel accepted or not that we have a
[53:33] backbone enough to say
[53:34] this is truth and this is not amen
[53:38] and the prophet of god said the
[53:39] compromise of the church started in the
[53:41] pulpit
[53:42] amen their stories in brother branham's
[53:45] ministry one of them is a jewish rabbi
[53:47] they said if i stood for that i would be
[53:51] on the street
[53:53] amen what was it his will
[53:56] to stand with the word of god was weaker
[53:59] than his will
[54:01] to have support in his old age
[54:05] to have a nice house a nice car a good
[54:08] retirement
[54:11] that's right oh my
[54:17] would this be a good time church to talk
[54:19] about my retirement program
[54:23] i think it would i've got a mansion
[54:27] just over the hilltop i've got
[54:30] a provision in the kingdom of god
[54:34] that he said i will never leave you i
[54:36] will never forsake you
[54:38] i take care of the sparrow i will take
[54:42] care of you
[54:43] [Music]
[54:44] oh hallelujah what a retirement the
[54:46] prophet of god said you know they're
[54:48] there he says what about insurance what
[54:50] about this what about that i have
[54:52] assurance oh his wife there now look
[54:55] bill what are you doing i
[54:57] didn't say i have insurance i have
[54:59] assurance
[55:01] what a retirement program to know that
[55:04] we
[55:04] are walking in the will of almighty god
[55:06] not subject to the will of the devil not
[55:09] subject to the whim
[55:10] and the will of the world but under the
[55:12] anointing of the word for our hour we
[55:14] can stand and say thank you lord
[55:16] that even in hard times i am in the will
[55:20] of god and my heart's desire is to live
[55:23] in the will of god
[55:25] hallelujah amen
[55:29] you see we we come and this struck me in
[55:31] such a way
[55:33] you know that we just things become
[55:35] familiar to us right some would call it
[55:37] cliches
[55:38] i pray we never use this message we
[55:40] might repeat things
[55:42] but never let it just be a cliche let
[55:44] every word that we speak and every
[55:47] thought that we
[55:48] think be founded in the word of god not
[55:51] just something that sounds good that we
[55:53] repeat
[56:00] but we look and see in the time as satan
[56:03] exerts his will upon the world
[56:06] prophecy says my brother and sister that
[56:09] it would cause kings and kingdoms to
[56:11] fall he
[56:11] causes the people to come and give their
[56:15] treasure
[56:20] that's everything they hold dear we
[56:23] oftentimes read that scripture and think
[56:25] okay they're throwing their cash that
[56:26] might be right
[56:27] you know i i say this a little bit
[56:29] humorous a little bit facetious
[56:31] uh church do do we need to just go ahead
[56:34] and put the credit card machines on the
[56:36] back of the
[56:36] uh pew because uh research has proven
[56:39] that people give between 15 and 20
[56:43] 15 and 27 percent more money in
[56:45] offerings and ties
[56:47] if they can swipe it on a car
[56:56] well i just don't have time to give
[56:58] something offering
[56:59] so we're going to make it convenient for
[57:01] you no really what they're doing is
[57:02] they're looking for the 15 to 27 percent
[57:05] that's right
[57:06] they're not they're not looking to make
[57:08] it convenient for because if we're going
[57:09] to make the message convenient
[57:11] we'll set you all up with a nice little
[57:13] deal and you can sit at home in your
[57:14] recliner with your bunny slippers and
[57:16] eat popcorn during church that's what's
[57:17] convenient
[57:18] yes god didn't say i'm gonna have a
[57:20] convenient gospel for you he said i'm
[57:22] gonna have a gospel that changes your
[57:23] life
[57:24] a dynamic gospel a gospel that will
[57:26] shake you out of your rot and shake you
[57:28] out of the world that you were in
[57:30] and cause you to rise up to be who i
[57:33] called you to be
[57:34] not to be what is convenient
[57:40] think about it everywhere we go is
[57:41] convenience i rode with sister jerry
[57:45] she went and picked up her groceries at
[57:49] walmart
[57:52] i don't know that it gets more
[57:53] convenient than that we sit in the car
[57:55] with the ac on
[57:57] and we watch this little girl sweating
[57:59] pushing the cart out
[58:01] and then she's unloading it in the back
[58:02] of our car and then as she's been
[58:05] trained to do she comes
[58:06] do you want me to close the tailgate oh
[58:09] no
[58:11] we can do that ourself
[58:17] where are we headed saints
[58:20] an on-demand gospel go to grace
[58:24] nampa.org and have a selection
[58:29] happy sermon corrective sermon
[58:34] sermon i won't sleep through sermon i
[58:36] will sleep through
[58:38] i can just click on whichever one i feel
[58:42] no see this is not what god called for
[58:43] god said you know what i want you to
[58:45] come
[58:46] i want you to put up with a man you
[58:47] might say why in the world did god call
[58:49] that man i don't know either
[58:53] but it's not about convenience amen
[58:57] but while this will is being exerted he
[59:00] has become
[59:01] the god of this evil age he has come to
[59:05] where he dominates everything my brother
[59:07] and sister
[59:08] we can have and i won't go into the
[59:10] details you you know what i'm talking
[59:12] about we can have perversion
[59:14] unpunished and we can have good things
[59:17] then be
[59:17] censored the god of this evil age is
[59:21] there
[59:22] under in the influence and people there
[59:24] believe it was
[59:25] so what did this come from my brother
[59:27] and sister because somebody deluded the
[59:29] word of god
[59:30] someone started watering it down because
[59:32] it took so many people
[59:34] and so much money to keep the church
[59:36] alive and keep it all functioning we got
[59:38] to keep the pew full
[59:40] well i'll tell you what i will go by
[59:42] that quote that's on my
[59:43] my desk there in the office there i'd
[59:46] rather preach to two people
[59:48] and be right in the eyes of the lord
[59:50] than to preach to 10 million and have to
[59:52] compromise
[59:53] hallelujah and how much more so that we
[59:55] could sit here in the tabernacle this
[59:56] morning
[59:57] and sit here with saints of lack
[59:59] precious faith
[1:00:00] that just want the pure word of god
[1:00:02] without the will of the devil the god of
[1:00:05] this evil age
[1:00:06] bringing his influence now look brother
[1:00:08] branham first speaks of this
[1:00:10] now you know sometimes we just take
[1:00:12] things for granted
[1:00:13] and when i just felt an unction to
[1:00:15] really bring this
[1:00:16] out and you realize brother branham
[1:00:17] doesn't really touch on this and
[1:00:19] and i'll bring you a quote here in just
[1:00:21] a second so you'll understand
[1:00:22] but brother branham doesn't teach or
[1:00:25] speak on god of this evil age until
[1:00:28] uh the eighth month that's uh what
[1:00:30] september
[1:00:33] august okay see thank you
[1:00:37] august of 1965 all of his ministry
[1:00:42] he's not dealing with god of this evil
[1:00:44] age
[1:00:45] he's not now he is dealing with it you
[1:00:47] know what i'm saying he's not bringing
[1:00:48] out and vocalizing it
[1:00:50] putting a god of this evil age but we
[1:00:52] come now to august um
[1:00:54] uh oh excuse me my mind's just racing
[1:00:56] first day of august
[1:00:58] 1965. now brother branham says right
[1:01:00] here
[1:01:01] um hallelujah well
[1:01:06] where we have brothers here we go
[1:01:10] now listen for satan is not spoken as a
[1:01:14] god
[1:01:15] of any other age but this age he wasn't
[1:01:18] spoke of
[1:01:19] of the god of the age of noah he wasn't
[1:01:21] spoke of
[1:01:22] of the god of the age of moses the god
[1:01:25] of the age of elijah
[1:01:27] but this evil age he is oh don't miss it
[1:01:30] he is the god of this evil age worshiped
[1:01:33] by millions and billions of people
[1:01:35] and they don't know it
[1:01:39] that is the real deception is that they
[1:01:41] believe
[1:01:42] they are worshiping god but the image my
[1:01:45] brother and sister that's been put
[1:01:47] before him
[1:01:47] has been tarnished it's been changed
[1:01:50] it's been modified
[1:01:51] it's been painted as it were slightly
[1:01:54] different
[1:01:55] i remember one time a story of a man
[1:01:57] that was offered some
[1:01:59] famous painting like a vincent van gaal
[1:02:01] or something like that
[1:02:02] and and the man was there and there they
[1:02:05] were pressuring him
[1:02:06] you know just a limited offering here to
[1:02:08] you and if you pass it up
[1:02:09] it is there and the man then secretly
[1:02:12] called a friend who was a
[1:02:13] a expert on paintings and said come here
[1:02:16] and look at this
[1:02:17] and he keeps looking and keeps looking
[1:02:19] until his friend
[1:02:20] comes and when his friend comes in
[1:02:23] obviously the people he's dealing with
[1:02:24] are not happy
[1:02:25] but here's now i hope you get this here
[1:02:28] is a man
[1:02:29] who knows what he's looking at this is a
[1:02:32] man that has been
[1:02:33] schooled and understand what it is and
[1:02:36] he walks into the room
[1:02:37] and they pull the velvet from the
[1:02:39] picture and he says it's a fortress
[1:02:41] turns around and walks out and the man
[1:02:44] insisted no this is an original this is
[1:02:46] original so the man says my friend says
[1:02:49] it's a forgery
[1:02:50] it's a forgery and he walks out and he
[1:02:52] catches up with his friend
[1:02:53] he says how do you know it was a forgery
[1:02:58] and he said oh it might be worth buying
[1:03:02] because it is a masterpiece
[1:03:06] of a forgery
[1:03:11] and then he proceeds to name off
[1:03:14] a detail and a detail
[1:03:18] and a detail that's not correct
[1:03:22] but would have fooled any man believing
[1:03:25] for just a few million
[1:03:26] he could own a vincent van gogh
[1:03:32] just like the devil today has said hey
[1:03:35] you can get eternal life for signing
[1:03:38] your name
[1:03:40] on the book at grace tabernacle just
[1:03:44] minor details
[1:03:47] but one that has been schooled in the
[1:03:49] word of god
[1:03:50] recognizes it's not just an attendance
[1:03:54] record
[1:03:54] a name a membership book it's
[1:03:57] our life amen that's what we give for
[1:04:01] eternal life
[1:04:03] is our life he's already given his life
[1:04:05] we don't have to try to crucify christ
[1:04:07] again
[1:04:08] we don't have to try to go back and find
[1:04:10] the foundation of our salvation
[1:04:12] or the foundation of eternal life we
[1:04:14] don't have to do that
[1:04:16] what we have to do is come and ascribe
[1:04:18] to what the foundation of eternal life
[1:04:20] said we must do and that is to give our
[1:04:23] life yes amen amen that's right
[1:04:30] worship by millions billions of people
[1:04:32] and they don't know it
[1:04:34] but let's let this scripture amen
[1:04:37] now i don't mean to say this critically
[1:04:39] but i believe this is something it's
[1:04:41] just
[1:04:41] ramping up saints many of you are
[1:04:44] isolated from these things and i say
[1:04:46] that is good
[1:04:47] but it is ramping up in our midst
[1:04:52] of people saying well you just have to
[1:04:55] this and you just have to that
[1:04:58] i'm sorry my brother and sister
[1:05:02] it says let's let the scripture amen
[1:05:06] there's where the prophet of god took us
[1:05:07] back
[1:05:09] he didn't say take it back to what i
[1:05:11] said
[1:05:13] take it back to what this one said or
[1:05:14] what that one said
[1:05:16] constantly he affirms to us take it
[1:05:20] back to the bible
[1:05:24] and then he says don't let the bible be
[1:05:26] of
[1:05:27] any man's private interpretation
[1:05:30] so we have to take it back to the
[1:05:32] infallible word of god
[1:05:34] amen so let's let the scripture uncover
[1:05:36] this morning
[1:05:38] who is the god of the age amen
[1:05:41] and so we're we're not going to kind of
[1:05:44] go quite that direction
[1:05:45] you're believers you've been around
[1:05:47] you've been up and down the block amen
[1:05:48] you know these things but the very next
[1:05:50] service that he preaches
[1:05:52] is the same day in the evening and it is
[1:05:56] events made clear by prophets
[1:05:59] now i'm telling you my brother and
[1:06:01] sister we should be thrilled of the
[1:06:03] events that are being made
[1:06:04] clear by prophecy because prophecy
[1:06:08] is what is revealing who you are amen
[1:06:11] amen the prophecy of the word declaring
[1:06:13] that there will be a righteous and holy
[1:06:16] bride
[1:06:16] standing in the last days giving praise
[1:06:19] glory and honor to god
[1:06:21] living the word out becoming the word
[1:06:23] made
[1:06:24] flesh this is what the word says my
[1:06:26] brother and sister
[1:06:27] and that is what we are doing this is
[1:06:30] what is happening to you and i
[1:06:32] is we are actually coming to the place
[1:06:35] that we
[1:06:35] are the literal fulfillment of the word
[1:06:38] of god
[1:06:39] in our day now look i don't speak this
[1:06:41] critically but some people are believing
[1:06:43] the prophet must come back
[1:06:44] to bring this special anointing my
[1:06:47] brother and sister
[1:06:48] to get a bride into the rapture but do
[1:06:50] you realize the prophet of god
[1:06:52] himself in the message spoke over and
[1:06:55] over and over again
[1:06:56] things like my ministry will soon be
[1:06:58] finished amen
[1:07:00] that's right are we gonna bring him back
[1:07:03] against god's will
[1:07:05] to get us into rapturing faith when he
[1:07:07] already gave us everything we need to
[1:07:09] make a rapture
[1:07:10] and the word of god has been opened with
[1:07:12] rapturing faith for you and i to take a
[1:07:15] hold of that
[1:07:16] your midnight hour your time of prayer
[1:07:18] your reading of the bible
[1:07:19] studying of the message there is the
[1:07:22] unfolding of rapturing faith
[1:07:24] it won't be some man saying now you do
[1:07:26] this this and this and you'll make
[1:07:28] a rapture unless he's telling you pray
[1:07:30] read your bible
[1:07:31] and surrender yourself to christ then
[1:07:33] that might be the influence
[1:07:34] but to give you some kind of recipe
[1:07:41] that's right
[1:07:44] now here we are the evening service
[1:07:48] brother branham for the first time in
[1:07:49] the morning brings out
[1:07:52] the god of this evil age lays it out
[1:07:55] never before it's this age amen
[1:07:58] this is the age that satan becomes the
[1:08:01] god of
[1:08:02] then in the evening service he says and
[1:08:04] when you see the church getting worldly
[1:08:08] like it was in the days of sodom see the
[1:08:11] church world all going
[1:08:13] into the worship
[1:08:16] can i just speak blunt this morning we
[1:08:19] got way too many message people
[1:08:21] ascribing to hillsong amen and two i
[1:08:25] i i won't even go um i'll stop right
[1:08:27] there sorry i mentioned their name
[1:08:30] but we got long-haired people that you
[1:08:33] just click on the soundtrack
[1:08:35] and you're like that's so beautiful but
[1:08:38] when you see it in person
[1:08:40] you're seeing these people men long hair
[1:08:43] women short hair dressed vulgarly on
[1:08:46] that singing about the righteousness of
[1:08:48] god
[1:08:49] something's wrong something's out of
[1:08:52] kelter my brother and sister
[1:08:56] why because the god of this age has now
[1:08:59] been redefined
[1:09:01] you understand that they took god from
[1:09:04] in front of the people they put him back
[1:09:07] behind the veil and hid him for a while
[1:09:11] and then when they reintroduced him he
[1:09:14] was a different god
[1:09:16] but all they knew was god's here
[1:09:19] god's here that must be god they got a
[1:09:22] god that's
[1:09:23] like old grandfather kitties just
[1:09:27] love grandpa i'll buy you presents i'll
[1:09:30] tell you how much i love you
[1:09:32] well my grandchildren if they were vocal
[1:09:35] enough to tell you
[1:09:36] will tell you i'm not a very good old
[1:09:38] grandpa
[1:09:40] do that again i'm going to whip your
[1:09:41] head
[1:09:43] and i mean it yeah that's it because
[1:09:45] we're not trying to raise good children
[1:09:48] we're trying to raise good adults
[1:09:51] unless of course you want to keep your
[1:09:54] kid
[1:09:56] you imagine how much damage you do to a
[1:09:58] boy
[1:09:59] he's now eight years old and you still
[1:10:01] insist he wears a diaper
[1:10:02] and mama gets to go out and grab it on
[1:10:04] the back and peek in it
[1:10:09] no sir by the time he gets up there old
[1:10:12] enough
[1:10:13] he's gonna say i'll run away from home
[1:10:14] before i'll put up with this any longer
[1:10:17] but you see what's happening they're
[1:10:19] keeping the church so
[1:10:21] immature it don't even know by the word
[1:10:25] how to judge whether it's god or not
[1:10:27] they're just like oh this is god this is
[1:10:29] god i felt it
[1:10:32] well i'll tell you what if i hear one
[1:10:33] more person come to me and say well i
[1:10:35] just
[1:10:35] feel you're going to hear a scream echo
[1:10:38] upon the hills of this valley
[1:10:40] i don't care what you feel excuse me for
[1:10:44] yelling
[1:10:46] i don't want you to feel like i'm
[1:10:47] intimidating
[1:10:52] show me one place in the word i feel i
[1:10:55] feel
[1:10:56] i feel
[1:11:00] in case someone thinks i'm being
[1:11:01] aggressive this morning i'm actually
[1:11:03] just very happy
[1:11:06] because this word is alive amen and it's
[1:11:09] real
[1:11:10] and something inside of us is saying
[1:11:13] amen amen amen and ben
[1:11:16] the god of this world right here my
[1:11:18] brother and sister is not my god
[1:11:22] my god is a righteous and a holy god an
[1:11:24] ever-present god
[1:11:25] and a god that says i'm going to bring
[1:11:28] you to such an anointing
[1:11:30] that you will take your own bible
[1:11:34] and you will judge yourself
[1:11:38] well i just don't like it when the
[1:11:39] pastor gets up and he preaches and i
[1:11:42] feel like he's judging me you know why
[1:11:44] you would feel that way
[1:11:46] i wanna i want you now i'm gonna kick
[1:11:47] satan in the teeth right now
[1:11:49] any time you would ever say that is
[1:11:52] because you haven't been
[1:11:54] judging yourself amen
[1:11:59] because if you judged yourself by the
[1:12:01] word and the pastor come
[1:12:04] and said you ought not be doing that you
[1:12:08] would say
[1:12:08] amen amen
[1:12:12] brother paul loves me he's not trying to
[1:12:15] make me feel bad
[1:12:16] he loves me and god's using him to
[1:12:19] remind me of what i've already looked in
[1:12:21] the word and judge myself
[1:12:23] and realize i need to change
[1:12:26] but you see satan's will is
[1:12:32] which one of my relatives was sitting up
[1:12:33] close here so i could go up and rub
[1:12:36] all over them and give you my version of
[1:12:39] the
[1:12:39] warm and fuzzy
[1:12:42] where he just pastor loves me so much
[1:12:46] told me even though i'm living in sin
[1:12:50] i'm going to make the rapture
[1:12:53] no the pastor ain't doing a very good
[1:12:54] job no and neither are you or else you'd
[1:12:57] be saying pastor
[1:12:59] that's not according to the word
[1:13:02] but you see the will the battle of the
[1:13:05] wills
[1:13:08] see the church would worship god of this
[1:13:11] evil age seeing that
[1:13:12] then seeing a little minority group
[1:13:14] isn't it funny we live in a time right
[1:13:15] now i wasn't going to preach on this but
[1:13:17] i just can't help myself
[1:13:18] have you ever noticed my brother and
[1:13:19] sister god's going to deal with a
[1:13:20] minority
[1:13:21] amen right he's calling out a minority
[1:13:24] he's bringing a people
[1:13:26] that are not done and what is the big
[1:13:28] fuss we have in the world
[1:13:30] right now what's it about
[1:13:34] minorities
[1:13:37] satan's trying to call attention
[1:13:40] to this little minority and lift it up
[1:13:42] and say oh see you're not doing it right
[1:13:46] and the whole time trying to draw
[1:13:48] attention from another minority
[1:13:50] that is standing there in the midst that
[1:13:52] the religious world says
[1:13:54] you know what if you guys had truth i
[1:13:56] won't tell you where to find this
[1:13:58] but it's out there as a resource people
[1:14:01] well we know
[1:14:02] this ministry of william branham while
[1:14:03] it was supernatural and many things
[1:14:05] happened
[1:14:06] we have seen now that it hasn't really
[1:14:10] amounted to much
[1:14:15] hallelujah well you can
[1:14:18] gold plate your piece of plastic all you
[1:14:21] want
[1:14:22] but god is producing a bride that is
[1:14:25] solid gold she has no flaw she has no
[1:14:29] air
[1:14:29] she has no contamination hallelujah
[1:14:33] so you look now you might say brother
[1:14:34] paul you really went out on a limb there
[1:14:36] but i'm telling you my brother and
[1:14:37] sister the times in the shadows
[1:14:38] we're calling attention to the
[1:14:39] minorities here because satan's trying
[1:14:41] to call
[1:14:41] attention away from this minority that
[1:14:44] is the bride of jesus christ in the hour
[1:14:47] so while chaos is uh flooding the world
[1:14:50] amen
[1:14:50] he's trying to draw it away to make
[1:14:52] people like you
[1:14:54] look like you're the oddball you're not
[1:14:57] into diversity you're not into
[1:14:59] acceptance you're not into equality
[1:15:01] what do all of those mean my brother and
[1:15:03] sister they're meaning what the devil
[1:15:06] defined them in this day
[1:15:09] he's the one giving the definition
[1:15:14] i know all of you are familiar with
[1:15:17] wikipedia
[1:15:20] do you ever look up definitions on
[1:15:22] wikipedia
[1:15:27] and you can almost name the generation
[1:15:29] of the person who wrote that definition
[1:15:33] because a lot of those definitions don't
[1:15:35] fit my generation
[1:15:37] and considering that brother david's
[1:15:38] sister diane brother bob you know
[1:15:40] uh of you might say another
[1:15:42] dispensational mark going back
[1:15:43] might even say the definition of my day
[1:15:45] doesn't quite fit the definition of
[1:15:47] their day
[1:15:47] and so you see what's happening it is
[1:15:49] slowly redefining
[1:15:52] the god of this evil asia is redefining
[1:15:54] the rights and the wrongs and the goods
[1:15:56] and the bads and
[1:15:57] and what's fair and what's equitable and
[1:15:59] all of these things redefining it all
[1:16:01] and i actually feel sorry for young
[1:16:03] people in this day because they go to a
[1:16:05] resource
[1:16:06] and the resource is not supporting god's
[1:16:09] word the foundation of our nation from
[1:16:11] days gone by
[1:16:12] the resource is supporting satan's
[1:16:14] definition of our day
[1:16:17] no wonder it'll be so close to see the
[1:16:19] very lick but my brother and sister
[1:16:21] it won't deceive the very elect the very
[1:16:23] dilect is not uh grounded in wikipedia
[1:16:25] and the spirit of the day
[1:16:27] the very left is grounded in the word of
[1:16:29] god and i
[1:16:30] am god and i change not so we can go
[1:16:32] back to that word and
[1:16:34] hang our soul on that hallelujah
[1:16:38] hallelujah hallelujah where was i
[1:16:41] amen seeing that little minority
[1:16:43] gathered out from under the inspiration
[1:16:44] of god
[1:16:45] producing again the life of jesus christ
[1:16:48] amen that's what the minority is going
[1:16:50] to do not the majority the minority
[1:16:53] is going to produce the life producing
[1:16:55] again the life of jesus christ by the
[1:16:57] scripture
[1:16:58] that's supposed to happen you know what
[1:17:00] hour you're living in this bible
[1:17:02] foretells by prophecy
[1:17:04] what day we're living and what time
[1:17:06] we're living
[1:17:07] amen amen
[1:17:13] and what kind of events ought to be
[1:17:15] taking place
[1:17:16] now look at those events taking place my
[1:17:18] brother and sister the word shows us
[1:17:19] what's going to happen
[1:17:24] well i just saw in the news this and i
[1:17:26] saw on the news this and i saw in the
[1:17:27] news this and
[1:17:28] i just don't know what if they force us
[1:17:30] to all take a vaccine what if they do
[1:17:32] you know what you need vaccinated
[1:17:35] i'm here to tell you this morning every
[1:17:37] one of you ought to say lord
[1:17:39] vaccinate me this morning lord inject me
[1:17:42] with your word
[1:17:44] let it flow through my veins let every
[1:17:46] cell of my
[1:17:47] body respond to the vaccination of the
[1:17:50] holy ghost
[1:17:51] then i will be inoculated sealed in in
[1:17:54] this wicked age
[1:17:55] hallelujah but you see there again maybe
[1:17:58] brother paul's getting out on a limb
[1:17:59] forgive me if you think i am
[1:18:01] but my brother and sister there again we
[1:18:02] have another shadow another type
[1:18:04] of a people that are worried about being
[1:18:06] vaccinated in the flesh when they ought
[1:18:08] to be worried about what's going on in
[1:18:10] their soul this body is just this body
[1:18:13] it will come and it will go
[1:18:14] and i'm not being cavalier about that if
[1:18:17] we die we die
[1:18:18] in the flesh but we will not die in the
[1:18:21] spirit
[1:18:21] because death cannot come to a son or
[1:18:24] daughter of god
[1:18:25] but we are so oh my goodness i'm sorry
[1:18:28] to say this but we got churches
[1:18:30] split from fellowship of other churches
[1:18:32] because one church is saying
[1:18:33] i'm not getting vaccinated for nothing
[1:18:35] it's a mark of the beast and another one
[1:18:36] over there going
[1:18:37] we're supposed to comply with what they
[1:18:39] tell us
[1:18:42] well good they're here telling you give
[1:18:43] us your children are you going to comply
[1:18:50] let's find balance on that okay i maybe
[1:18:52] just gave you a slightly
[1:18:54] skewered view
[1:18:58] but the holy ghost will level
[1:19:01] the balance for you
[1:19:05] hallelujah amen you know
[1:19:09] we'll leave all that for another day
[1:19:13] what time we're living what kind of
[1:19:14] events ought to be taking place you see
[1:19:16] my brother and sister
[1:19:17] we're not looking for what's happening
[1:19:18] in washington dc or
[1:19:20] and new york at the u.n or what's
[1:19:23] happening at
[1:19:24] league of nations in brussels we're not
[1:19:26] looking to none of that matters
[1:19:28] i'm looking to another kingdom that's
[1:19:30] right amen i'm looking to
[1:19:32] one who says you know what i'm here
[1:19:36] now you can take this any way you please
[1:19:38] i'm just going to say it blind
[1:19:39] i'm here to exert my will
[1:19:43] on those who will believe
[1:19:46] amen in other words if you say you
[1:19:49] believe
[1:19:51] god's got a pathway for you amen
[1:19:55] we can't say we believe oh man does it
[1:19:58] says i believe and goes off on his own
[1:20:00] path
[1:20:01] but god's got a will for you
[1:20:04] and i it foretells exactly to the letter
[1:20:08] and has never missed one age all the
[1:20:10] time not one time has it ever missed and
[1:20:13] it won't
[1:20:14] for who are predestinated to see it
[1:20:17] we'll see it
[1:20:18] jesus said no man comes to me except my
[1:20:20] father draws him
[1:20:21] and all that the father has given me
[1:20:24] will come and that's why i stand here
[1:20:26] this morning and tell you
[1:20:27] i believe you will come i believe you
[1:20:29] were called of god i believe even if you
[1:20:31] are sitting here right here this morning
[1:20:33] uninspired sitting here struggling with
[1:20:35] things in your life
[1:20:36] wondering if you should serve god or go
[1:20:38] out and serve the devil
[1:20:40] i believe you're here because god called
[1:20:42] you here
[1:20:43] i don't believe it's just an accident
[1:20:45] and if you're sitting here just waiting
[1:20:47] for the moment
[1:20:47] i'm 18 and i'm pushing the eject button
[1:20:50] well you just hang on because brother
[1:20:52] paul is over here and i'm not boasting
[1:20:53] on myself
[1:20:54] i'm telling you the truth i'm over here
[1:20:56] saying lord whatever you got to do i
[1:20:58] want to see our young people
[1:21:00] i want to see our families i want to see
[1:21:02] our old people
[1:21:03] in the word filled with the holy ghost
[1:21:05] and so i'll tell you we've got a battle
[1:21:07] of wills
[1:21:08] if you're ready to push an eject button
[1:21:09] i'm over here telling you lord strap
[1:21:11] them in with another seat belt
[1:21:14] throw another strap around them and
[1:21:16] cinch them down tight lord
[1:21:18] don't let them go hallelujah
[1:21:23] not one time has it ever missed and it
[1:21:25] won't for who are predestinated to see
[1:21:28] will see it jesus said no man can come
[1:21:29] to me except my father draws him
[1:21:31] and all that the father has given me
[1:21:33] will come
[1:21:34] i wish this was in highlight both i
[1:21:36] almost asked brother alex to highlight
[1:21:37] pull this
[1:21:38] it's the word joining hallelujah with
[1:21:42] the word hallelujah look at this this is
[1:21:45] not some man trying to push his will
[1:21:47] over on you
[1:21:48] the prophet of god says i never come to
[1:21:50] get you to follow me
[1:21:52] i come to introduce you to jesus christ
[1:21:55] the world says oh they're in a cult they
[1:21:57] follow a man they follow a man
[1:21:59] well my brother and sister i tell you
[1:22:01] what we won't even go there this morning
[1:22:02] but i'm telling you some of us are just
[1:22:04] cynical enough cryptic enough
[1:22:06] analytical enough that i'm not gonna
[1:22:08] follow a man
[1:22:09] i saw that as a teenager and i saw
[1:22:12] families
[1:22:12] explode and the pieces are still
[1:22:15] unpicked up i
[1:22:16] saw all this nonsense of people
[1:22:18] following a man but when god comes down
[1:22:20] in our myth and we see a living god
[1:22:22] coming in our midst my brother and
[1:22:24] sister
[1:22:25] follow it don't sit back and say i'm
[1:22:29] afraid i might be deceived if you're a
[1:22:31] son of god or daughter of god you can't
[1:22:33] be deceived
[1:22:34] god will give you supernatural vision he
[1:22:36] will give you understanding
[1:22:38] he will give you guidance is that not
[1:22:40] the scripture
[1:22:42] amen amen it's the word
[1:22:46] joining with the word and that word is
[1:22:48] in me can someone say amen this morning
[1:22:51] that word is in me hallelujah it's not
[1:22:55] external
[1:22:56] it's who i am
[1:22:59] [Music]
[1:23:01] it can't do nothing else we know it the
[1:23:03] day
[1:23:04] that we're living in oh look at that
[1:23:07] can't do nothing else this is the day
[1:23:09] we're living in
[1:23:11] oh hallelujah that's it
[1:23:14] amen can you see it yes
[1:23:18] it's not woe unto me
[1:23:21] no sir way too many people around this
[1:23:24] message are like woe unto me
[1:23:27] poor us
[1:23:32] the word in you amen cannot reject the
[1:23:35] word that's coming
[1:23:36] to you that's right
[1:23:40] scares me people say i've been following
[1:23:42] the message for x amount of time
[1:23:45] and i don't believe that's what the
[1:23:46] prophet of god meant
[1:23:49] i'm like a turtle lord just in case
[1:23:52] you're sending a hand grenade a mortar
[1:23:54] or a cannon shell i'll just
[1:23:59] you know why the sermon the unveiling of
[1:24:03] god brother brown makes statements
[1:24:06] and then just a few quotes later a few
[1:24:09] paragraphs later
[1:24:10] says and they'll say it ain't so
[1:24:15] and we've got people that say brother
[1:24:16] man was a prophet
[1:24:19] look at what he said and say it ain't
[1:24:20] soul
[1:24:22] what spirit is that yeah right where did
[1:24:25] that come from
[1:24:27] i don't want to be judgmental so i won't
[1:24:28] decide whether they're a sadducee or a
[1:24:30] pharisee
[1:24:36] i hope you catch what i mean amen
[1:24:40] amen why the prophecy of the word says
[1:24:43] that we are going to fulfill the word my
[1:24:46] brother and sister
[1:24:46] didn't leave it with brother branham he
[1:24:48] fulfilled the portion he was called to
[1:24:50] but i was called to abortion were you
[1:24:52] called to abortion
[1:24:53] i want to fulfill the portion i was
[1:24:55] called to i don't want to be looking
[1:24:57] back to brother branham do what god told
[1:24:59] him to do get brother around and do what
[1:25:00] he did did brother run dude did it bro
[1:25:02] debate this debate that he should have
[1:25:04] went here he suddenly said no no no hold
[1:25:06] on oh what about you
[1:25:07] what about you are you doing what god
[1:25:10] called you to do
[1:25:12] or is the battle of the wills too big a
[1:25:15] battle
[1:25:16] for you and i and we're going to just
[1:25:20] go to church and we're going to go home
[1:25:24] and we're going to live life
[1:25:28] you see when you're a preacher there's
[1:25:29] certain things that raise your hackles
[1:25:31] yes sir
[1:25:32] can i be human the brothers were human
[1:25:35] brother trevor you don't mind if i just
[1:25:37] give a blip on you
[1:25:40] sweet brothers just like you sisters are
[1:25:41] sitting there sharing a little bit
[1:25:42] brother trevor's talking about a little
[1:25:44] experience at a restaurant
[1:25:45] and he's like
[1:25:50] come on you can say amen to that there's
[1:25:52] little things that cause your hackles to
[1:25:54] stand up and you're
[1:25:55] right
[1:25:59] and if we were just honest with each
[1:26:00] other we'd be saying
[1:26:02] that happens more often than should
[1:26:07] well maybe not to some of you
[1:26:10] but people like you
[1:26:15] so what happens god's coming down he's
[1:26:17] moving
[1:26:18] he's stirring hearts he's letting you be
[1:26:22] what you don't want to be
[1:26:26] isn't that amazing we got the idea that
[1:26:29] god's just going to whip us into shape
[1:26:30] and we're going to be this perfect
[1:26:31] little marching
[1:26:32] whatever but you see it's a great battle
[1:26:35] it's a great battle
[1:26:36] and that's why god don't feel bad saints
[1:26:38] but don't allow yourself to go on
[1:26:40] with this great feeling of euphoria oh
[1:26:42] god wants me to be like this
[1:26:46] oh god wanted me to be like that no sir
[1:26:49] what god's doing is allowing you to be
[1:26:51] that way
[1:26:53] so that then you can go away and the
[1:26:54] holy spirit move upon you
[1:26:56] and then you almost feel physically sick
[1:27:00] amen oh lord amen why did i do that why
[1:27:04] did i
[1:27:04] say that oh lord and the next time
[1:27:08] you feel like doing that you can then
[1:27:10] say i'm overcome
[1:27:11] i'll never do that again ever
[1:27:15] my wife and my children and the pastor
[1:27:17] and they're all exempt from this but i
[1:27:19] will never do that again
[1:27:21] no sir you see the battle of the wills
[1:27:25] the battle is constantly going on
[1:27:28] hallelujah how many of you can pet your
[1:27:29] black dogs
[1:27:34] you spend way too much time with him if
[1:27:35] you can pet him
[1:27:39] come on yeah we're not here to pet the
[1:27:43] black dog
[1:27:44] we're in a line up with the word of god
[1:27:46] amen so the words prophesied
[1:27:48] that in the bible we are going to
[1:27:49] fulfill the word of god amen
[1:27:51] to fulfill oh righteousness and can i
[1:27:54] make this boldly after saying what i've
[1:27:55] said
[1:27:56] we are amen we are saints fulfilling all
[1:27:59] righteousness
[1:28:01] it is not just a figure of speech it's
[1:28:02] not something we throw out it's not a
[1:28:04] cliche
[1:28:05] you are actually fulfilling all
[1:28:07] righteousness because god is changing
[1:28:09] you and i
[1:28:10] he is bringing us into his very image
[1:28:13] he's molding us
[1:28:15] now i for the sake of time my word is
[1:28:17] time go but
[1:28:18] going back to our scripture my brother
[1:28:20] and sister uh paul's speaking to timothy
[1:28:22] he didn't beat around the bush
[1:28:24] there's all these vessels and it's what
[1:28:26] you do
[1:28:27] whether you'll be a vessel of honor or
[1:28:29] dishonor
[1:28:30] oh well if i'm predestinated god's going
[1:28:33] to
[1:28:34] wash me and make me a vessel of honor
[1:28:38] well good when the preacher now i don't
[1:28:41] want you to feel ill
[1:28:42] for me so i'm going to use brother david
[1:28:43] for an example
[1:28:46] when the preacher comes out in the
[1:28:49] church
[1:28:50] and grabs you by the nap of your neck
[1:28:53] and drags you up to the pulpit to the
[1:28:56] platform
[1:28:57] and says repent get that out of your
[1:29:01] life
[1:29:03] well wait you're offended just a second
[1:29:05] you're all offended
[1:29:07] but weren't you the same ones that said
[1:29:09] if god wants out of my life
[1:29:11] he'll take it out
[1:29:12] [Music]
[1:29:15] come on you can't have it both ways you
[1:29:17] can sit there with your arms crossed in
[1:29:19] that stubborn spirit and say well if god
[1:29:21] wants my temper to go away
[1:29:23] if god wants this that god wants that
[1:29:24] well maybe god will come to the day i
[1:29:26] praise you thank you lord for letting
[1:29:28] brother david be the example
[1:29:31] it's going to be god anointed grabbing
[1:29:32] you dragging you up and you're going to
[1:29:33] be like i'm leaving this church i'm done
[1:29:35] with this church he's humiliated me
[1:29:36] well isn't that what you asked for
[1:29:41] wouldn't it be easier just simply to say
[1:29:42] lord but thy will be done
[1:29:46] lord soften me wash me cleanse me yes
[1:29:49] lord i don't want i don't want to be
[1:29:51] anything but what your word says i
[1:29:53] am amen amen
[1:30:00] we know the day we're living in isn't
[1:30:02] that beautiful
[1:30:03] okay now we're at the quarter point of
[1:30:05] our sermon today let's move forward
[1:30:08] praise the lord it's a day of
[1:30:10] celebration right
[1:30:12] now saints i have to admit this i'll
[1:30:14] have to hurry through this
[1:30:15] because there's just so much and as i
[1:30:17] was studying
[1:30:19] this really come alive to me now
[1:30:22] why does he stand by the reason is
[1:30:24] romans 8 17 18 and if the children then
[1:30:26] heirs heirs of god join heirs with
[1:30:27] christ
[1:30:28] it be so we suffer with him that we may
[1:30:30] also be glorified together
[1:30:32] for i reckon that the sufferings of this
[1:30:34] present
[1:30:35] time are not worthy be compared with the
[1:30:37] glory
[1:30:38] which shall be revealed to us
[1:30:41] in us unless we suffer with him we
[1:30:45] cannot reign with him
[1:30:46] you have to suffer the ring this is the
[1:30:48] reason the the reason for this
[1:30:50] is that character is simply never made
[1:30:53] without suffering
[1:30:54] amen now i want to ask you this morning
[1:30:56] how many of you want
[1:30:57] character amen come on every hand in
[1:31:01] this building ought to be
[1:31:02] up every one of us ought to be saying
[1:31:04] lord give me patience give me
[1:31:06] character don't sit there and try and
[1:31:08] back out of that like well i know the
[1:31:09] lord will do it anyway
[1:31:11] you might as well stand up and volunteer
[1:31:13] amen amen
[1:31:18] reminds me of a story about a young man
[1:31:19] in the army they have this detail
[1:31:24] you ten go over here get shovels
[1:31:27] you guys go over here get garbage cans
[1:31:30] you guys go over there
[1:31:31] and do this and this guy he just kept
[1:31:34] slinking kind of back through the crowd
[1:31:36] pretty soon the sergeant says who wants
[1:31:38] to drive a truck
[1:31:40] yes go get that wheelbarrow
[1:31:48] well god's going to get you to volunteer
[1:31:51] one way or another you think praise the
[1:31:53] lord i just want to be blessed i want to
[1:31:55] be the one in church
[1:31:56] standing on the pew sing it hallelujah
[1:32:05] i'll move on
[1:32:10] recent vast characters simply never made
[1:32:11] without suffering
[1:32:13] character is a victory
[1:32:17] not a gift a man without character can't
[1:32:20] reign because power apart from character
[1:32:22] is satanic and i'm on to just throw this
[1:32:25] out to you
[1:32:26] look at our government yes sir
[1:32:29] you will see the exact manifestation of
[1:32:32] this right here
[1:32:34] in our government amen
[1:32:39] reminds me i won't name the court the
[1:32:41] deal but some of the financial stuff
[1:32:42] that i like to read and follow
[1:32:44] there was a ceo did some things he
[1:32:46] shouldn't have done
[1:32:48] and they ousted him
[1:32:51] and when it was all said and done from
[1:32:53] ousting him
[1:32:55] he was going to sue them pursue suing
[1:32:58] them
[1:32:59] and the reason was is they had
[1:33:01] shortchanged him
[1:33:03] they only gave him 125 million dollars
[1:33:08] to leave and it should have been 200.
[1:33:13] see what kind of characters taking over
[1:33:15] our world
[1:33:17] i can't live on 125 million dollars
[1:33:21] well i probably couldn't either i mean
[1:33:23] you think about that
[1:33:25] i mean
[1:33:29] yeah in fact i kind of get depressed
[1:33:31] thinking about that
[1:33:36] but power with character
[1:33:40] is fit to rule and since he oh i hope
[1:33:43] you see
[1:33:44] i hope this means as much to you as it
[1:33:45] means to me and since
[1:33:47] he wants i'm sorry i i read this quote
[1:33:50] just and i can't get this out of it
[1:33:51] and since he wants paul to share even
[1:33:53] his throne
[1:33:55] amen can you put your name in there
[1:33:58] since he wants us amen put your name in
[1:34:00] there
[1:34:01] amen since he wants us to share even his
[1:34:04] throne
[1:34:05] and the same basis that he overcome and
[1:34:07] is set down in his father's throne
[1:34:09] then we have to overcome to sit with him
[1:34:11] and when i read it that way there's
[1:34:13] something inside of me says
[1:34:15] overcome paul press to the mark keep
[1:34:17] going paul
[1:34:18] repent if you've got to repent praise
[1:34:21] when you should pray
[1:34:22] stand on the word of god amen
[1:34:25] amen or do we see ourselves like we
[1:34:29] mostly are in normal life and we're
[1:34:32] one little blip in the masses
[1:34:35] of humanity well
[1:34:40] i wouldn't have been born where i was
[1:34:42] born if god really and i wouldn't have
[1:34:44] this thorn in my flesh if god
[1:34:49] i wouldn't suffer from this and i
[1:34:51] wouldn't that
[1:34:52] i wouldn't have to count my pennies
[1:34:58] if god loves me
[1:35:03] thank you lord
[1:35:11] will shut up and move on amen i i'm just
[1:35:13] having a hard time with an inner voice
[1:35:14] this morning
[1:35:16] hey man i hope you don't mind i'm
[1:35:19] fighting it
[1:35:21] and a little temporary suffering
[1:35:24] that's it i wasn't able to buy a new
[1:35:28] pickup
[1:35:30] everybody's buying a new house and i
[1:35:32] kept my house
[1:35:34] they got new clothes i saw that dress
[1:35:36] and i saw that suit
[1:35:37] [Music]
[1:35:40] excuse me i'm telling the inner voice is
[1:35:42] just really hard on me this morning
[1:35:45] the little temporary suffering that we
[1:35:47] go through now is not worthy to be
[1:35:48] compared
[1:35:50] to the tremendous glory that will be
[1:35:52] revealed in us when he comes
[1:35:54] oh what treasures are laid up for those
[1:35:57] who are willing to enter into his
[1:35:59] kingdom
[1:36:00] through much tribulation who wants to
[1:36:02] enter in
[1:36:03] amen come on saints i'm not going to
[1:36:05] take the easy way remember when our kids
[1:36:07] look at our kids
[1:36:08] they're no longer kids anymore they're
[1:36:10] so grown up but remember you know when
[1:36:11] they put on the play for us
[1:36:16] you know what struck me i set right out
[1:36:17] there what struck me
[1:36:20] the shortcut of that whole little play
[1:36:24] what i remember so much was the shortcut
[1:36:30] i think any time you come to something
[1:36:33] that has a sign
[1:36:34] that says shortcut
[1:36:38] pass it by yeah
[1:36:41] yeah want to go in a rapture
[1:36:44] sign here oh
[1:36:48] okay must be a short guy
[1:36:52] that's strange or a treasure is laid up
[1:36:56] for those who are willing to enter into
[1:36:57] his kingdom through much tribulation
[1:36:59] think it not strange concerning the
[1:37:00] fiery trials that are to try you
[1:37:02] this is what peter said is it strange
[1:37:04] that god wants us to
[1:37:06] develop a christ-like character that
[1:37:09] comes through suffering no sir
[1:37:11] we all have trials can someone say amen
[1:37:14] we are all tried and
[1:37:15] chastened as sons not one but goes
[1:37:18] through that
[1:37:19] the church that is oh grace hang on
[1:37:22] i almost censored this out i almost had
[1:37:24] him just put a little line through this
[1:37:28] the church that is not suffering and is
[1:37:31] not being tried

[1:38:06] rain and the sun is shining and i'm okay
[1:38:08] with all of that lord
[1:38:10] what i care about is much greater amen
[1:38:12] much greater than that
[1:38:16] not but one goes through that the church
[1:38:17] that's not suffering is not being tried
[1:38:20] hasn't got it it isn't of god hebrews 12
[1:38:22] 6 8
[1:38:23] from whom the lord loveth he chastens us
[1:38:25] and scourges every son whom he receiveth
[1:38:27] but if you be without chastisement where
[1:38:29] of all your partakers then you're
[1:38:31] bastards and not sons wow that's pretty
[1:38:34] strong language isn't it
[1:38:36] amen that's quite a quote i hope you are
[1:38:38] we all good
[1:38:40] are we all good now
[1:38:43] this special condition in smyrna

[1:38:51] there's no age free from it there is no
[1:38:53] true believer free from it
[1:38:55] this is of god this is the will of god
[1:38:59] so look we're back now to this great
[1:39:01] battle between the wills
[1:39:04] oh hallelujah i hope you don't mind
[1:39:06] we'll be a few minutes long this morning
[1:39:07] because i have to finish this all the
[1:39:08] rest of this is
[1:39:09] not wasted but well anyway
[1:39:14] it's needful we need the lord to teach
[1:39:16] us the truth that we are to suffer and
[1:39:18] be christ-like in doing it
[1:39:19] love suffering long and is
[1:39:24] grouchy
[1:39:27] kind see that's why god moved no brother
[1:39:30] trevor under a bus
[1:39:32] that's why the lord checked trevor when
[1:39:34] he was a little grouchy
[1:39:35] with that clerk in there amen
[1:39:38] amen not be ashamed of saints no this is
[1:39:41] god

[1:40:00] is your reward in heaven for so
[1:40:02] persecuted they the prophets which were
[1:40:04] before you

[1:40:08] science god's disappearance
[1:40:10] amen come on saints
[1:40:13] neither are bright skies and still water
[1:40:15] signs of his love and approval
[1:40:17] his approval of any of us is only
[1:40:20] in the beloved amen amen now look at
[1:40:23] this
[1:40:23] the world we live in today one of their
[1:40:25] things my brother and sister
[1:40:27] is they take john 3 16 and apply it in a
[1:40:29] carnal
[1:40:30] fashion and they say oh god loves
[1:40:34] everybody
[1:40:38] what brother brown says here is in no
[1:40:39] way conflict with john 3 16.
[1:40:41] no sir his love is elective which he had
[1:40:44] for us
[1:40:46] before the foundation of the world does
[1:40:48] he love us
[1:40:49] oh yes but how shall we know
[1:40:52] we shall know because he said so
[1:40:55] amen i don't care what the troubles are
[1:40:58] of your life right now
[1:40:59] you can stand up and say god loves me
[1:41:01] amen i i it seems like everything i've
[1:41:03] done
[1:41:04] have any of you no you don't have to
[1:41:05] raise your hands but have any of you
[1:41:07] ever done something questionable
[1:41:09] yes go ahead raise your hands
[1:41:15] and then things didn't work so well
[1:41:18] and satan come and anointed you god's
[1:41:21] punishing me
[1:41:23] for what i did over here
[1:41:27] i know many are fine folks many a fine
[1:41:30] christian
[1:41:33] and they're like oh god's punishing me i
[1:41:36] i don't
[1:41:36] i don't think you got the right
[1:41:37] revelation on that man amen
[1:41:45] you know it's strange i hope this makes
[1:41:47] sense to you it's strange world we live
[1:41:49] in
[1:41:49] when i was a kid if you walked in a
[1:41:51] store and ate a banana they'd slap your
[1:41:52] hide off the floor and drag you out
[1:41:56] now they walk in the store they eat the
[1:41:58] banana
[1:41:59] and they say oh i'll pay for it at the
[1:42:01] checkout counter
[1:42:02] and now the very present is they walk in
[1:42:06] the store they eat the banana
[1:42:07] and drop the peel on the floor
[1:42:11] you see how times are changing
[1:42:16] and the time should be changing for the
[1:42:18] bride of christ that we are no longer
[1:42:20] looking at it as oh god
[1:42:21] loves me loves me not he said he loves
[1:42:24] us
[1:42:25] and it should never even be a question
[1:42:27] that enters our mind
[1:42:29] he loves us hallelujah
[1:42:33] amen by believing how we prove his love
[1:42:37] by believing what he said by conducting
[1:42:39] myself with joy amidst the trials that
[1:42:41] are in wisdom allow us to come to pass
[1:42:42] i know thy poverty because thou art rich
[1:42:45] there it is again see him walking up and
[1:42:46] down in the midst of his church
[1:42:48] like a father he is looking down upon
[1:42:50] his family he's the head of his
[1:42:51] household
[1:42:52] he is the provider i want to know how
[1:42:54] many of come on
[1:42:55] lift a hand if you will if you've got
[1:42:56] courage how many of you trust god so
[1:42:59] much today
[1:42:59] that you would lift a hand and say he's
[1:43:01] my provider he's my husband i
[1:43:04] am not going to try to make it happen
[1:43:07] i'm going to let my provider
[1:43:11] my husband you see if we're not in that
[1:43:14] position we're still trying to do we're
[1:43:16] striving
[1:43:16] for ourselves that's exactly right amen
[1:43:20] he's the head of his household he's a
[1:43:22] provider
[1:43:23] is a protector yet he looks on at their
[1:43:26] poverty
[1:43:28] oh how can this be oh how the untutored
[1:43:31] believer stumbles at this how can god
[1:43:34] bear to look upon his own in a time of
[1:43:36] need
[1:43:36] and not just stop it all just give in
[1:43:39] and
[1:43:39] lavish everything material
[1:43:43] on them oh hallelujah
[1:43:47] brother isaac one time shared with me
[1:43:50] a deal this preacher i don't remember
[1:43:53] the whole story he's there in the church
[1:43:56] and he's preaching some kind of
[1:43:57] prosperity gospel
[1:43:59] and he's there in the church he's got
[1:44:00] all the people raising their hands and
[1:44:02] the preachers raising his hands
[1:44:13] and money started to fall
[1:44:16] and then right behind that it reminds
[1:44:18] them all the more you give
[1:44:20] the more god will get you oh
[1:44:23] my that's pretty clever hallelujah
[1:44:26] brother i haven't come past the offering
[1:44:28] plate
[1:44:31] but you see a real believer sees through
[1:44:33] that amen
[1:44:34] no this god doesn't need our money
[1:44:39] so look at that come on i hope this
[1:44:42] dispels any of you have any issue with
[1:44:44] this
[1:44:45] how can god bear to look upon his own in
[1:44:47] a time of need not just stop it all
[1:44:50] i know i told you sweetheart parenting
[1:44:53] class here again sorry parents
[1:44:55] i know i told you honey you do it again
[1:44:57] i'm gonna whip you but instead i tell
[1:44:59] you what you do
[1:44:59] if you'll just go pick up two toys in
[1:45:02] your wreck of a room
[1:45:04] then i'll give you some ice cream
[1:45:14] i don't want to see you suffer i'm going
[1:45:17] to stop
[1:45:18] all this going on i'm going to stop your
[1:45:19] character building
[1:45:22] and i'm just going to give it all to you
[1:45:25] sorry that's not my god no that's right
[1:45:27] if you're a real believer it's not your
[1:45:28] god amen
[1:45:30] he wants you to have character because
[1:45:32] he knows that you will reign with power
[1:45:34] one day
[1:45:34] and anything short of having character
[1:45:37] he's already declared as satanic
[1:45:40] amen are we good can i go on just a few
[1:45:43] short more minutes
[1:45:44] here is where you have to believe again
[1:45:46] in the love and the goodness and the
[1:45:47] wisdom of god this too is needful
[1:45:49] remember he admonished take no thought
[1:45:52] for the moral
[1:45:53] right oh now y'all can just sit back and
[1:45:55] be quiet because this is
[1:45:57] to brother paul
[1:46:00] take no thought for tomorrow what you
[1:46:02] shall eat or what you shall put on
[1:46:04] your father knoweth the things you have
[1:46:06] need of
[1:46:07] i i i see the word need in there
[1:46:11] but it's not in the context that
[1:46:13] normally we're like lord
[1:46:14] i need this
[1:46:17] unless of course you were praying for
[1:46:19] patience
[1:46:21] he who closed the lily and feeds the
[1:46:23] sparrow
[1:46:24] shall do much more for you do we believe
[1:46:27] god sent a prophet
[1:46:28] do we believe these words are just
[1:46:30] haphazard just something to fill up time
[1:46:32] and space
[1:46:37] he'll do much more for you these
[1:46:39] physical things are not the true basic
[1:46:41] necessities of your life
[1:46:43] for a man's life consists is not of the
[1:46:45] things he possesses
[1:46:47] but rather seek ye first the kingdom of
[1:46:49] god and his righteousness
[1:46:51] oh look what the prophet of god says
[1:46:53] right here and all material necessities
[1:46:56] will be added unto you
[1:46:59] remember there's no i want in there
[1:47:05] amen the people of god are not
[1:47:07] material-minded
[1:47:09] oh can i be humble enough to stand
[1:47:10] before you and say it's something i
[1:47:12] fight against
[1:47:13] absolutely or should i act super
[1:47:17] spiritual and
[1:47:18] talk like it's all just your problem
[1:47:22] no sir there's times you look at things
[1:47:28] i'll tell you how silly this can get i
[1:47:31] was searching
[1:47:33] on a website those of you who
[1:47:38] buy things would be familiar with
[1:47:41] z idaho
[1:47:45] there was a pistol on there i drove all
[1:47:48] the way to cuna
[1:47:49] to say 40 bucks in a gas hog
[1:47:58] because i didn't have to pay sales tax
[1:48:08] but i wanted that pistol but i didn't
[1:48:11] want to pay sales tax
[1:48:13] so therefore i'll drive all the way to
[1:48:14] cuna i'll just
[1:48:17] it made perfect sense
[1:48:21] and i thought it did until this moment i
[1:48:22] just preached on it
[1:48:30] a pistol i've never shot
[1:48:35] oh my we won't go there
[1:48:39] they're not material minded they're
[1:48:41] christ's might that's right
[1:48:43] amen they do not seek the treasures that
[1:48:45] are below
[1:48:46] they seek those above it is absolutely
[1:48:49] true the majority of christians are not
[1:48:51] wealthy and i say thank you lord amen
[1:48:54] amen rather they are on the poor side it
[1:48:57] was so in jesus day was true in paul's
[1:48:59] day
[1:49:00] and it should be true today my
[1:49:03] you know there's people that claim on
[1:49:04] the internet you'll find this if you
[1:49:06] search far enough for it don't waste
[1:49:07] your time
[1:49:08] that believe brother branham laid the
[1:49:10] seed for the prosperity gospel
[1:49:15] well he did
[1:49:18] to the bride and the bride gets up every
[1:49:22] day wakes up in the morning and says
[1:49:24] i am rich amen i am rich
[1:49:27] every day that i live i am rich
[1:49:31] okay let's go on the quote and i'll
[1:49:33] prove that to you
[1:49:36] and it is not too true today for the
[1:49:40] latest
[1:49:41] church is one of vast wealth where often
[1:49:43] the criterion of spirituality
[1:49:44] is an abundance of earthly goods my how
[1:49:47] rich the church is in goods but how poor
[1:49:50] in spirit
[1:49:50] blessed be ye poor for yours is the
[1:49:53] kingdom of god
[1:49:54] the kingdom of god is meat and drink it
[1:49:56] is not material
[1:49:58] it is within us hallelujah
[1:50:02] a rich man here's my quote to prove my
[1:50:05] point hallelujah
[1:50:07] a rich man
[1:50:10] i'm rich this morning i am wealthy
[1:50:13] beyond
[1:50:14] any measure there is on the face of the
[1:50:17] earth hallelujah
[1:50:19] oh hallelujah
[1:50:22] amen a rich man
[1:50:26] is rich in god not in worldly things
[1:50:31] oh christ the spirit i see your poverty
[1:50:33] i see your need you haven't very much if
[1:50:35] anything to boast of
[1:50:37] what you did have has been taken from
[1:50:40] you
[1:50:40] you gladly gave up your possession in
[1:50:42] exchange for eternal ones
[1:50:44] you're laughed at you're scorned you
[1:50:46] don't have material resources to fall
[1:50:48] back on
[1:50:48] but you are rich in spite of it all your
[1:50:51] security
[1:50:53] now can i just speak god to you amen
[1:50:56] you might own a little ground you might
[1:50:59] own
[1:51:00] a little business that produces
[1:51:01] something you might have money
[1:51:03] in the bank but i can assure you if that
[1:51:06] becomes your security blanket then
[1:51:10] god will take your blanket
[1:51:13] from you amen amen that's right
[1:51:17] oh how to do it moms you know what i'm
[1:51:20] talking about
[1:51:21] some of you had children that sucked
[1:51:23] their thumb
[1:51:25] i'm not speaking ill of that why did
[1:51:27] they do that
[1:51:28] somewhere along the line have become a
[1:51:30] security to them
[1:51:32] of comfort some children
[1:51:35] had a blanket yes sir
[1:51:41] now mom now i know this comes across
[1:51:44] course forgive me but mom won't you be
[1:51:47] ashamed
[1:51:50] when your child is going off to college
[1:51:54] still sucking their thumb and dragging
[1:51:58] a blanket now that's hard
[1:52:03] i'm not speaking ill of that because we
[1:52:04] as humans we all have we all have little
[1:52:07] things as a childhood i'm not going to
[1:52:08] reveal mine so don't ask
[1:52:12] but you see god says no no no no no i i
[1:52:15] don't have any children
[1:52:17] i don't have a bride i don't have a a
[1:52:19] people that i've called
[1:52:20] that have some other form of security
[1:52:26] so what do you do if you're in a
[1:52:30] irresponsibly attached to something on
[1:52:33] this earth
[1:52:34] don't be shocked when god takes it from
[1:52:36] you that's right he's doing it because
[1:52:38] he loves you
[1:52:39] he's doing it because you've got to be
[1:52:41] broken from this security
[1:52:43] and completely be dependent upon him
[1:52:46] [Music]
[1:52:48] amen but you are rich in spite of it all
[1:52:50] your security lies in him who is your
[1:52:53] shield

[1:53:01] everlasting one yes i'm mindful of your
[1:53:02] trials and woes and i know how hard it

[1:53:06] this when i return to claim you as my
[1:53:09] own
[1:53:09] then i will reward you now this is
[1:53:12] nothing against rich people
[1:53:14] because god can save a rich man some of
[1:53:16] god's children are rich
[1:53:18] but money can be such
[1:53:22] a snail now look at this
[1:53:26] i won't go back to it but remember our
[1:53:28] opening scripture
[1:53:31] to come we have to we have to take me
[1:53:34] back brothers
[1:53:35] to the very our opening scriptures i'm
[1:53:37] sorry saints
[1:53:39] amen hallelujah
[1:53:42] now look at this and meek instructing
[1:53:44] those that oppose themselves
[1:53:46] have you ever found yourself making a
[1:53:47] decision you don't ain't the right one
[1:53:48] you did it anyway
[1:53:50] that's what the devil usually does amen
[1:53:54] gets us to i shouldn't do this we do it
[1:53:59] if god prevention will give them
[1:54:00] repentance acknowledging them truth
[1:54:02] that they may recover themselves out of
[1:54:04] the snare of the devil
[1:54:07] who are taken captive by him
[1:54:10] at his will we're talking about the
[1:54:13] devil just deciding i'm going to come
[1:54:15] down
[1:54:15] and i'm going to tie you up i'm going to
[1:54:17] wrap you up i'm going to put you and
[1:54:19] bind you
[1:54:20] i'm going to take you in this snare and
[1:54:23] my will
[1:54:24] now saints think about this you say well
[1:54:26] we're believers we're message believers
[1:54:28] this won't happen to you it does
[1:54:31] come on somebody have the courage to say
[1:54:32] amen it does
[1:54:35] you know you could let something just go
[1:54:37] away or be an offense
[1:54:39] and we choose to make an offense you can
[1:54:42] let
[1:54:42] something that is done and it'll be in
[1:54:44] such a way or stand up
[1:54:46] i recently bought an object and the
[1:54:48] man's filling out the bill of sale
[1:54:50] and he says just tell me what number you
[1:54:52] want wrote in here
[1:54:54] you don't have to pay sales tax
[1:54:57] you know what the devil does comes right
[1:54:59] in there right in that moment and
[1:55:00] anoints you
[1:55:02] yeah i mean if he put half the money on
[1:55:05] there they wouldn't know the difference
[1:55:06] i'll just pay a few dollars in sales tax
[1:55:11] oh but the holy ghost comes along
[1:55:14] and says i took you out of that snare
[1:55:16] once that's right
[1:55:17] i delivered you from that don't go
[1:55:21] back see
[1:55:24] but the devil is going to be right there
[1:55:26] to offer it
[1:55:28] right there to alfred oh sorry i'm
[1:55:30] getting all drawn out this morning i
[1:55:31] told myself don't do it paul don't do it
[1:55:33] paul
[1:55:34] just preach real fast and furious and be
[1:55:35] done
[1:55:39] hallelujah let's go back to where we was
[1:55:42] brother
[1:55:44] amen some of god's children are rich but
[1:55:47] money can be such
[1:55:49] a snare not only to those who now some
[1:55:51] of you are probably thinking
[1:55:53] i know some of you read ahead on these
[1:55:54] quotes and i just wish you would
[1:55:57] yes the rich man's going to have
[1:55:58] problems but did you know if we sit here
[1:56:01] come on let me just paint a little
[1:56:03] scenario
[1:56:04] you just got your paycheck you just paid
[1:56:07] the mortgage or the rent
[1:56:09] you paid your car payment you bought
[1:56:10] groceries
[1:56:12] and there's oh my goodness
[1:56:16] not much left over
[1:56:20] lord if i i just won that 456 million in
[1:56:25] that lottery
[1:56:28] of course lord i would pay tithes i'd
[1:56:30] build a whole brand new church
[1:56:33] i'd make the church give brother paul a
[1:56:35] paycheck
[1:56:38] and i would buy that mansion and i would
[1:56:41] buy
[1:56:42] that car and i would buy these clothes
[1:56:44] and this boat and that fishing pole and
[1:56:46] that gun
[1:56:48] i would do this and i would do that
[1:56:51] probably a reason you don't have 453
[1:56:56] million dollars
[1:56:58] because it would become a snare
[1:57:04] and the more you have the more time you
[1:57:07] have to devote
[1:57:10] and satan would be going now see this is
[1:57:13] opposite contrary to him and thinking
[1:57:14] satan would be like i got their soul
[1:57:18] i bought 10 000 worlds
[1:57:22] for only 453 million
[1:57:26] now think about it in a business sense
[1:57:27] that's a bargain
[1:57:29] that's a bargain
[1:57:32] but money can be a snare only not only
[1:57:34] to those who have it but to those who
[1:57:36] don't have it
[1:57:37] way back in their first age jade cried
[1:57:40] out to those who were putting stock in
[1:57:42] wealthy people
[1:57:43] have not the faith of our lord jesus
[1:57:45] christ with respect of persons
[1:57:47] the poor there were trying to butter up
[1:57:49] the rich in order to get help rather
[1:57:52] than trusting in god that's right
[1:57:54] you know i'm just going to throw this
[1:57:56] out
[1:57:57] this has happened on every continent
[1:57:59] amen you'll see
[1:58:02] people receive help from churches from
[1:58:04] ministries
[1:58:06] and then as god blesses it and their
[1:58:07] little group is there
[1:58:10] instead of trusting they just
[1:58:13] have been trained now walk around with
[1:58:16] their hand
[1:58:18] brothers we want this brothers we need
[1:58:21] this
[1:58:22] brothers can you this brothers can you
[1:58:24] do that
[1:58:29] come on saints you know why grace
[1:58:30] tabernacle has a gift of god right here
[1:58:33] in this building is because those who
[1:58:36] labored through the years
[1:58:38] cried out to god and said lord that's
[1:58:40] right that be your will
[1:58:41] father we'd like to have a church of our
[1:58:43] own not to have to move from pillar to
[1:58:45] post like we did for years
[1:58:47] it was not my brother and sister a
[1:58:49] handout
[1:58:50] except from the lord see
[1:58:54] we didn't go i've never revealed this to
[1:58:57] you
[1:58:58] we've had people that come and said hey
[1:59:02] we can raise money for you to build a
[1:59:04] church
[1:59:05] some of you that were been through with
[1:59:07] us through the years here you'd be
[1:59:08] saying what brother paul you didn't no
[1:59:10] no my brother sister i never felt like
[1:59:12] god would bless us with the church
[1:59:14] because somebody down here
[1:59:15] somebody over there somebody over piled
[1:59:17] a bunch of cash up and gave it to us
[1:59:20] you know why we can value what we have
[1:59:22] here because god gave it to us
[1:59:25] not another man not no string no nothing
[1:59:28] just god
[1:59:30] amen
[1:59:33] the poor trying to butter up the rich in
[1:59:36] order to get help rather than trusting
[1:59:37] god don't do it says james don't do it
[1:59:40] money isn't everything money isn't the
[1:59:42] answer
[1:59:43] and today it's not the answer either we
[1:59:45] have more wealth than we have ever had
[1:59:47] yet less being accomplished spiritually
[1:59:50] oh my goodness it's not with money that
[1:59:54] god works
[1:59:54] he moves by spirit with the moving of
[1:59:57] the spirit comes
[1:59:58] only to a life amen
[2:00:01] consecrated to the word
[2:00:04] amen amen who wants to be rich this
[2:00:07] morning
[2:00:08] amen hallelujah i want so much of jesus
[2:00:11] christ
[2:00:12] in my life i want so much of the power
[2:00:14] of god in our mid saints
[2:00:16] that we can literally walk around saying
[2:00:18] i'm rich beyond measure
[2:00:20] hallelujah now look i i got to hurry i

[2:00:31] hope your source after we've read this
[2:00:33] stop reading song of
[2:00:36] degrees of david if it had not been the
[2:00:39] lord who was on our side
[2:00:40] now may israel say if it had not been
[2:00:43] the lord who was on our side
[2:00:44] when men rose up against us then they
[2:00:47] had swallowed us up quick
[2:00:49] when their wrath was kindled against us
[2:00:51] then the waters had overwhelmed us the
[2:00:53] stream had gone over our soul
[2:00:55] then the proud waters had gone over our
[2:00:57] soul blessed be the lord
[2:00:59] who hath not given us as a prey to their
[2:01:02] tea
[2:01:03] our soul is escaped as a bird out of the
[2:01:07] snare of the fowlers
[2:01:08] the snare oh can someone say hallelujah
[2:01:11] this morning
[2:01:12] the snare is broken

[2:01:18] christ
[2:01:18] walking in this life looking for a snare
[2:01:21] looking for a snare
[2:01:22] because the holy ghost said i'll lead
[2:01:24] you you think god's going to lead you
[2:01:26] into something against his word
[2:01:27] he's not going to leave you there he's
[2:01:29] not going to guide you where you are
[2:01:31] going to fall and never get up he's
[2:01:33] going to lead you into all righteousness
[2:01:35] oh hallelujah this snare is broken
[2:01:39] and paul has escaped
[2:01:42] hallelujah we're no longer sitting here
