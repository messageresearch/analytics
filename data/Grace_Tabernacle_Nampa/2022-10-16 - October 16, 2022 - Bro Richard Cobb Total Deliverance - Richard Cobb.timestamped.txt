[37:34] your honor in the name of Jesus Christ
[37:36] amen
[37:39] praise the Lord
[37:41] it's good to be here today
[37:45] I'm glad to see that
[37:47] vanity has not taken over this church
[37:51] because I used the men's restroom
[37:53] downstairs and they removed the mirrors
[37:54] amen praise the Lord
[37:59] unless the women stole them
[38:02] I don't know amen praise the Lord amen
[38:08] uh it was like I wonder what's going on
[38:11] here amen
[38:13] praise the Lord God's so good
[38:16] Amen brother Paul caught so many flies
[38:18] the other day at his house think he's
[38:19] having spasms foreign
[38:26] voice is a little bit weak today but uh
[38:30] obviously God had something in store
[38:32] because
[38:34] last Sunday we went to a a waterfall and
[38:38] I
[38:39] just about slid in
[38:43] amen and then my daughter got one of my
[38:45] daughters got stung and then just the
[38:47] whole week has been a battle amen so we
[38:50] know God's is going to speak amen
[38:52] praise the Lord
[38:54] hey man let's stand and turn to the word
[38:56] of God Exodus 23
[39:00] 20-23
[39:02] .
[39:07] Exodus 23
[39:09] .
[39:11] 20 through 23.
[39:28] behold I send in Angel before thee
[39:31] to keep thee in the way
[39:33] and to bring thee into the place which I
[39:35] have prepared
[39:37] beware of him and obey his voice provoke
[39:40] him not
[39:42] for he will not pardon your
[39:43] transgressions for my name is in him
[39:47] but if Thou shalt indeed obey his voice
[39:50] and do all that I speak
[39:53] then I will be an enemy unto thine
[39:55] enemies and an adversary a two thine
[39:58] adversaries
[39:59] for mine Angels shall go before thee and
[40:02] bring thee in unto the amorites and the
[40:05] Hittites and the parasites and the
[40:07] Canaanites and the hivites and the
[40:09] jebusites and I will cut them off
[40:12] Lord may you bless the word of God today
[40:15] and Lord
[40:16] I I do believe God you're you're here to
[40:20] speak Lord and so God I just say thank
[40:22] you Lord Jesus in the name of Jesus
[40:24] Christ amen praise the Lord you may be
[40:27] seated
[40:28] and God loves trust us so much that he
[40:34] he even leads us right into our enemies
[40:39] uh sometimes we're thinking oh why God
[40:42] he says for your own good I I know what
[40:45] I'm doing amen and so uh even in these
[40:49] scriptures he led them into all his
[40:51] enemies because it was all him that
[40:54] would give the word and the life to
[40:58] bring Victory to them amen
[41:00] and so today we want to speak on a
[41:03] complete and total Deliverance
[41:05] amen and so my subtitle is are you ready
[41:09] to receive it amen Hallelujah that's the
[41:12] whole thing right there a complete and
[41:14] total Deliverance it's already been
[41:16] given to us Amen on the cross so praise
[41:20] the Lord and so
[41:22] Israel walked in total Deliverance in
[41:25] every part of their life
[41:27] as they put God in the proper position
[41:30] isn't that what what did Brother Brown
[41:32] speak on he spoke on adoption because we
[41:35] all have to come to our position in
[41:37] Christ
[41:38] and so as when we have that position in
[41:40] Christ then we can walk and talk and
[41:43] speak and do things that no other
[41:45] denominational thinking person though
[41:47] they'd be so good and so nice the fact
[41:50] is they cannot have the victory that the
[41:53] bride of Christ has amen and so I I
[41:56] don't say that message people have I say
[41:59] the bride of Christ has amen praise the
[42:02] Lord Jesus because that is a major
[42:04] difference amen hallelujah praise the
[42:08] Lord and so God would lead them into the
[42:11] very Camp of their enemy knowing that he
[42:14] had confidence in them as His People to
[42:18] defeat that enemy and they still had to
[42:21] defeat that enemy amen we have to push
[42:23] away that laodicean spirit and and and
[42:26] and get into the position of saying I
[42:29] have to take this word I have to speak
[42:31] and go forward amen because brother
[42:33] Brown said God doesn't pick us up by a
[42:35] caller and just set it into his will
[42:37] amen we fight for every inch of ground
[42:40] this morning but it's already ours amen
[42:43] and so he was confident that they would
[42:46] walk in a victory
[42:48] amen God's still confident today
[42:51] and so don't let it's there's we need to
[42:54] keep our eyes off of all of the other
[42:57] things that would that would produce
[43:00] unbelief we need to not look at those
[43:02] things and we need to look at the word
[43:04] of God which always produces faith and
[43:07] it will bring that total and complete
[43:09] deliverance
[43:11] and so it's uh because sometimes I mean
[43:14] even you know pastors and ministers get
[43:16] that the the devil tries to attempt them
[43:19] to be kind of cast down and and you know
[43:22] God's been dealing with me of what is
[43:24] that to thee follow thou me amen
[43:28] hallelujah and so and be not weary in
[43:31] well-doing amen because we're not here
[43:33] to please us we're here to find Sheep
[43:36] amen and to give them the word of God
[43:38] Amen
[43:40] and so the church has always been in the
[43:43] minority
[43:44] yes amen it doesn't matter what size of
[43:48] message church or church that people
[43:49] have God's Church Capital C is always
[43:54] been in the minority amen Hallelujah and
[43:57] so and it will always be and it will
[44:00] always be that way to the coming of the
[44:02] Lord
[44:03] amen and so because and so God seen down
[44:08] through time in the laodicea he says I
[44:10] have a lot of people there and I'm going
[44:12] to give them the best thing I can ever
[44:14] do and that's the revelation of my word
[44:16] amen
[44:17] and in that Revelation they will walk
[44:20] they will talk they will feel they will
[44:23] they will move in perfect harmony with
[44:26] me and no weapon formed against them
[44:29] shall prosper amen no weapon that will
[44:32] come against you in any form shall
[44:34] prosper in your life it can't do it
[44:38] it can't it's impossible amen
[44:41] Hallelujah well brother but you don't
[44:44] know my sir I'm not I don't even care
[44:45] about your circumstances
[44:47] right amen right
[44:49] uh because you've already won hey Matt
[44:53] you've already had the word given to you
[44:57] we just have to walk in it amen
[45:00] and so because the church today even
[45:03] though they're safe Sanctified and
[45:06] filled with the Holy Ghost amen some are
[45:08] living below their Privileges and in all
[45:11] of us to a certain certain extent
[45:12] because our revelation of God has to
[45:15] meet his revelation of himself amen and
[45:18] so God had to restore a word to his
[45:21] church and see they had to have the word
[45:24] restored brother bam said so that uh in
[45:29] uh ah
[45:31] was it the lap overtime anyway one of
[45:34] those messages and and he says the
[45:36] godhead and the baptism had to be
[45:38] restored so that the bride could come
[45:40] and be bride even amen and so he had to
[45:43] restore that word so that we could know
[45:45] what the Holy Ghost is amen and we know
[45:49] that the Holy Ghost is his Spirit In
[45:52] Action inside of you amen and brother
[45:54] Brown said that he will give you that
[45:56] Holy Ghost and you alone will know what
[46:00] it's done in your life amen and so you
[46:02] don't have to act like everybody else
[46:04] some people may act a certain way praise
[46:07] God but you don't have to act that way
[46:09] all you do is test that Spirit by the
[46:11] word and see what kind of spirit it is
[46:13] and if it's in the word then you got the
[46:15] holy spirit amen hallelujah and so he
[46:19] wanted to give the word so that we could
[46:22] receive the Holy Ghost amen because in
[46:25] this particular time of History which is
[46:29] in the time of the fullness with the
[46:31] Capstone coming down is that the Holy
[46:34] Ghost has been released in its fullness
[46:36] amen for this day Amen brother Brown
[46:40] said that in the in those other ages
[46:42] that those men had the Holy Spirit he
[46:45] goes I be dares not to say they didn't
[46:47] have the Holy Ghost but they were
[46:49] begotten and begotten means they're
[46:51] still in the womb amen he said he said
[46:53] this is not me and they said in this day
[46:56] it's a birth amen it's Jesus Christ
[46:59] manifesting in his fullness and so if
[47:02] Christ is here it is full that's today
[47:04] then we have full and complete Victory
[47:07] today amen
[47:09] hallelujah amen we just have to choose
[47:12] it
[47:14] amen we just have to say Lord whatever
[47:16] you want and so this church today
[47:22] recognizes the word as the only typos
[47:27] nothing else
[47:28] you know you don't you don't care what
[47:31] your favorite preacher says amen you
[47:33] love him you love to listen to him but
[47:35] that's not your absolute
[47:37] amen all you care about is the
[47:40] revelation of the word in your life that
[47:43] is the typos and so God restored his
[47:46] word amen and put her Focus back on him
[47:51] amen that's why gone are the days of the
[47:54] and it was fun wasn't it to go to all
[47:57] the camps all the meetings and and see
[47:59] all the wonderful speakers amen but
[48:01] we're past that now amen I don't need
[48:03] the special speaker amen I don't need
[48:06] the special singer I don't need the
[48:07] special anything all that I need is the
[48:10] word manifested amen and we can throw
[48:14] those those terms around all we want but
[48:16] when I literally I when I say that I
[48:19] literally mean this word manifesting in
[48:21] your life
[48:22] Hallelujah
[48:26] our Focus the bride's focus is back on
[48:28] her husband
[48:30] she's not flirting anymore
[48:32] and so God told Israel everything he
[48:35] would do in their life
[48:38] if they would keep he and his word amen
[48:41] you keep my Commandments I'm going to do
[48:43] everything that I said in that word amen
[48:45] hallelujah and he says just keep me in
[48:48] my proper position amen I want to be
[48:51] your head I want to be your husband I
[48:53] want I want to give you everything that
[48:55] you have need of and so the restoration
[48:58] of the word is about you the preaching
[49:02] is about you
[49:04] amen God gave his Prophet for you amen
[49:08] amen don't wait for him to come back
[49:11] because he's not coming back like that
[49:13] he he'll come to branham's
[49:17] right
[49:20] if your toes need to be stepped on I'm
[49:22] the man
[49:24] he he will come to his route he'll meet
[49:26] them in the air not you
[49:30] oh I that spirit
[49:34] amen that that is the wrong spirit
[49:37] because guess what that will keep you
[49:39] weak and you will go through the
[49:41] tribulation with that kind of spirit
[49:44] amen and so it is about you you know I'm
[49:49] not married to brother Branham
[49:51] and and I can't I couldn't have the
[49:54] revelation of my husband without him
[49:56] amen but I tell you what amen he wants
[50:00] us to put our eyes on to Jesus Christ
[50:03] Amen brother Branham if he was here I
[50:06] could say almost thus saith the Lord he
[50:08] would say get your eyes off of me and
[50:10] get it back on the word
[50:14] amen praise the Lord
[50:18] see
[50:20] this is about you not brother Brown not
[50:23] Joseph not Jeff not Bill and Billy
[50:25] Paul's the nicest most gentleman person
[50:27] you'd ever want to meet amen how many
[50:29] have met him
[50:30] oh yeah every
[50:33] Excellent Man
[50:35] praise the Lord
[50:37] but they're not my salvation I don't
[50:39] have to travel to Mecca once a year
[50:42] right come on hallelujah amen all I have
[50:46] to do is meet Jesus Christ amen
[50:50] and because their dad yielded himself to
[50:54] God then guess what I don't when people
[50:57] even talk about they start cutting down
[50:59] the message and stuff it's just like
[51:02] you're you might as well stop you're not
[51:04] hurting me
[51:05] because we're not even supposed to
[51:07] defend it amen
[51:08] I've already met Christ so you're too
[51:10] late amen amen
[51:13] and so it's about you today
[51:17] this whole
[51:23] oh you really think so you think it's
[51:25] about yeah praise the Lord and so it's
[51:29] about you and not about building a group
[51:32] or a church
[51:34] hallelujah praise the Lord and so it is
[51:37] the will of God for all God's people to
[51:42] be delivered amen every person in here
[51:45] is already delivered
[51:49] amen that's that's the way I see it and
[51:52] that's the way the word sees it amen but
[51:55] see because of the spirit we live under
[51:57] in this day because you know good people
[52:00] get confused they say well laodicea
[52:02] doesn't affect the bride
[52:05] really yeah
[52:07] who who told you that not the prophet
[52:10] amen
[52:12] Hallelujah but that spirit will plague
[52:15] you until you get out of this body amen
[52:18] amen but what happens is it gets good
[52:21] people to mentally consent
[52:27] that God can't deliver them
[52:32] yeah God in his word says I've already
[52:35] I've already I've already amen praise
[52:38] the Lord amen and so all we have to do
[52:42] is press in to it amen it's ours
[52:45] Hallelujah but the spirit of the age
[52:47] says oh you go to church you know you
[52:51] know worship a little bit and and you
[52:53] know feel a little bit good amen and and
[52:56] and then and that's good enough
[52:58] no it's not amen hallelujah praise the
[53:02] Lord but it's about you putting back
[53:05] your husband in his rightful headship
[53:07] amen hallelujah praise the Lord because
[53:10] he wants to deliver you
[53:12] amen and so if we're going to receive
[53:15] anything from God we must put ourselves
[53:17] in position to receive it so are we are
[53:21] we ready to receive it this morning amen
[53:24] are we ready to just let God be God let
[53:27] his word be his word and take us through
[53:30] every situation child training uh wife
[53:34] and husband training Financial Training
[53:36] whatever it is are we ready to let God
[53:39] do it amen
[53:41] Hallelujah praise the Lord
[53:44] I really like
[53:46] running into people who have who have
[53:49] been discouraged
[53:50] and who you know maybe they stopped
[53:53] going to churches message churches and
[53:55] because I want them to be able to meet a
[53:59] person who loves God
[54:01] and and they'll see that and that's for
[54:04] you and I as well is that when people
[54:06] get discouraged they leave they they
[54:08] just you know do things that it
[54:11] manifests they may you know
[54:13] they may get a mohawk or they may get
[54:15] whatever tattoos all over the place and
[54:18] and uh one day one of our
[54:22] Charities nieces were coming to meet us
[54:25] and everybody kept going now don't don't
[54:27] don't look at her don't you know she's
[54:29] this and that don't don't be
[54:32] um
[54:32] fixated on her and and she come in there
[54:35] she had one I think one nose ring
[54:38] and I'm like
[54:40] really
[54:42] I said in my in Oregon
[54:45] yeah
[54:46] that that's that's you get that when
[54:49] you're born
[54:52] amen
[54:54] and and no then you treat them like a
[54:56] human
[54:57] amen
[54:59] Hallelujah and so we're we're we want to
[55:02] be able to we want to be able to treat
[55:04] those who
[55:06] have gone away from Christ or have never
[55:09] got there yet amen but have been told
[55:12] that if you disbelieve brother Brown was
[55:14] a prophet then you're full of the Holy
[55:15] Ghost you know something strange like
[55:17] that then we want to be a testimony to
[55:20] them and so it's the will of God for all
[55:23] his people to have Deliverance
[55:26] amen remember that today amen and we
[55:30] must have ourselves in a position to
[55:33] receive because how many of us and I've
[55:36] been through it but how many people do
[55:37] you know that that they love God but
[55:39] they don't put himself in a word
[55:42] position to receive him and so they're
[55:45] always wondering why doesn't God do what
[55:47] he said he will do look at Gideon uh
[55:50] he's saying where God where's all the
[55:52] Miracles what happened and God's saying
[55:54] hello Gideon it's you it's the people
[55:57] I've been here all the time amen the god
[56:01] of William Branham has didn't die amen
[56:04] with him but he's more real today that
[56:07] he was even then amen
[56:09] yeah oh if you really listen to those
[56:12] tapes you'll hear him as he gets towards
[56:14] the end of his life I wish I had more
[56:17] faith
[56:19] that's it you're gone what are you
[56:21] talking about listen to those standing
[56:24] in the gap on Amen I wish I had more
[56:27] faith I God has to push me to do
[56:30] everything amen but see we have the
[56:32] benefit of those stories of those
[56:34] testimonies and now we can see that that
[56:38] we can just speak and go forward in the
[56:41] name of Jesus Christ
[56:43] Hallelujah in faith
[56:45] praise the Lord Jesus
[56:48] and so
[56:50] we just have to give God an opportunity
[56:52] right
[56:53] because in several of the uh indictments
[56:58] he's he says you know they bring an
[57:01] accusation oh I went to the meeting and
[57:04] and I had hands laid on me they said I
[57:07] was healed and I never felt nothing
[57:11] yes it's like well then
[57:15] you're still healed
[57:18] amen see if we're going to receive
[57:22] something for God we have to believe it
[57:25] and and and we have to keep creating the
[57:28] atmosphere in our home for Faith for to
[57:31] grow amen yes and so if we believe this
[57:34] word then no matter how long it takes
[57:36] then it will manifest a lot of us
[57:38] sometimes it's been years before the
[57:41] manifestation of the healing came but it
[57:44] was still the supernatural God right
[57:47] amen amen and so it was just as true
[57:49] that day that you had hands laid upon
[57:51] you as it was when it actually
[57:53] manifested amen
[57:55] hallelujah praise the Lord
[57:58] they lay hands on the sick they shall
[58:00] recover amen hallelujah amen don't let
[58:05] the devil take anything from you amen
[58:07] hallelujah and so if you're going to
[58:11] receive then just keep confessing say
[58:13] Lord I don't understand but I know that
[58:15] I'm Healed Lord I don't know why but I
[58:17] know I'm Healed Lord Jesus I don't know
[58:19] why amen that I have to go through these
[58:23] things but I know that I'm Healed or I
[58:25] know that you've put me in this position
[58:27] amen hallelujah and so if we know what
[58:32] our armor is
[58:34] amen and that we have the god-given
[58:37] right to use it then we will have
[58:40] Deliverance what is our armor it's the
[58:42] whole armor of God Amen it's that sword
[58:46] of the spirit The Shield of Faith amen
[58:49] the helmet of salvation it's all of
[58:51] those things and and to to a new
[58:54] Christian it's like you know you're
[58:55] trying to put all that stuff on Amen but
[58:58] but what it is he just naturally adds it
[59:00] to you amen as you grow praise the Lord
[59:03] Jesus
[59:04] amen Hebrews 12 1-2
[59:11] amen
[59:14] one of the
[59:16] we are at in Ohio a few months ago and
[59:20] gave a testimony about laying hands upon
[59:23] a
[59:25] somebody at work and
[59:28] and he was dead and
[59:30] then God brought him back and uh brother
[59:37] David was there
[59:39] and I told he was he had been preaching
[59:42] and I just had told him that you know
[59:44] the next time I see that man I'm gonna
[59:46] tell him that he's a miracle the very
[59:48] next morning was my shift morning
[59:51] and we got a call to the exact same
[59:54] place
[59:55] and it was him and I got to tell him
[59:59] you're a miracle I just about scared him
[1:00:00] off the cot he was having chest pain
[1:00:01] again but
[1:00:03] uh they ended up shocking him like 13
[1:00:05] times on from then on to the hospital
[1:00:07] but but I that God was just dealing with
[1:00:10] me about laying hands on the sick and
[1:00:12] just letting God recover him and so just
[1:00:14] walking by him I could see the line was
[1:00:16] flat and you don't usually recover from
[1:00:19] that Rhythm and so I just said a little
[1:00:22] prayer on my way by by the time I got to
[1:00:24] the heart monitor it was
[1:00:26] and so I gave that testimony and there
[1:00:28] was a nurse in there and so she went to
[1:00:31] work the next day and there's a woman
[1:00:33] with cancer in her liver and she came in
[1:00:36] for a biopsy and and so the technician
[1:00:39] come in and she was very nervous so she
[1:00:41] goes oh yeah brother rich said this and
[1:00:44] so which God said it amen she laid hands
[1:00:48] upon the patient and then the the person
[1:00:51] was doing the scan to try to find the
[1:00:53] right place and and it was taking a long
[1:00:56] time and so the finally she goes excuse
[1:00:58] me I'm gonna be right back and so it
[1:01:00] made the patient really nervous well the
[1:01:02] technician came back and and she goes
[1:01:05] there's nothing there it's all gone
[1:01:12] and she said that they all broke down
[1:01:14] and started crying amen and so that is
[1:01:18] his body at work amen
[1:01:21] all she did was take the word she put
[1:01:24] her self in a position in the word just
[1:01:26] to do what the body does amen and then
[1:01:30] the body manifested Christ by the word
[1:01:33] to somebody who's probably not even a
[1:01:36] believer
[1:01:37] right all right amen praise the Lord
[1:01:40] amen hallelujah brother Paul was giving
[1:01:43] us testimonies yesterday and it's so
[1:01:44] awesome so in Hebrews 12 1-2 it says
[1:01:48] wherefore seeing we also are compassed
[1:01:51] about was so great a cloud of witnesses
[1:01:54] let us lay aside every weight
[1:01:57] all those thoughts what ifs
[1:02:00] God I've seen this so many times and it
[1:02:02] Lord I want to believe it but it never
[1:02:05] works out
[1:02:07] let's just lay those down amen God's the
[1:02:10] great physician
[1:02:11] hallelujah amen and and the sin which
[1:02:15] does so easily beset us and let us run
[1:02:18] with patience the race that is set
[1:02:20] before us looking unto Jesus the author
[1:02:23] and the finisher of our faith amen and
[1:02:27] so we have witnesses we have people and
[1:02:30] there's more and more people in our
[1:02:32] local assemblies who are receiving the
[1:02:35] word of God and and allowing God to work
[1:02:38] through them because they put themselves
[1:02:40] in the position amen
[1:02:43] amen and so I really I've come to
[1:02:46] realize that we we don't really have too
[1:02:49] many normal people
[1:02:54] in in the fact
[1:02:56] yes we are oddballs but we've had we
[1:03:01] have probably over half of the churches
[1:03:04] have people coming who have been taught
[1:03:07] wrong
[1:03:10] so how can we become impatient with them
[1:03:16] what you're saying well whose standard
[1:03:18] are you saying
[1:03:20] absolutely
[1:03:22] this standard God's standard where you
[1:03:25] can search through the the message and
[1:03:27] the scripture and it all runs together
[1:03:28] that's what I'm talking about the
[1:03:30] standard and so these people need to see
[1:03:34] they need to hear the word of God Amen
[1:03:37] Hallelujah and and sometimes they'll
[1:03:40] respond the wrong way amen but as a
[1:03:43] father amen as a pastor as a minister we
[1:03:46] have to say all right they did that
[1:03:48] because of this amen I'm not going to
[1:03:50] take it personally amen and so I'll tell
[1:03:54] you what when God
[1:03:57] was it you that came to God or did God
[1:04:01] draw you to God
[1:04:02] amen that's right so right there you're
[1:04:06] out of the picture
[1:04:08] and so when God called you
[1:04:11] he gave you everything on your journey
[1:04:14] that you would need right then
[1:04:20] you mean I don't have to go to church
[1:04:21] and read the Bible no that's not what
[1:04:23] I'm saying he gives you all that you
[1:04:25] have need of for your journey right
[1:04:27] there and then amen and so as long as
[1:04:30] you are in the line of duty amen that's
[1:04:34] another thing are are you a wife are you
[1:04:37] a husband are you this that or the other
[1:04:39] amen if you're in the line of duty
[1:04:42] according to the word then nothing shall
[1:04:45] stand in your way
[1:04:48] that's that is thus saith the Lord for
[1:04:52] you this morning
[1:04:53] nothing shall stand in your way
[1:04:57] it's true anyway
[1:05:00] I I Don't Preach anything that I haven't
[1:05:03] experienced amen
[1:05:05] well that's because you're a pastor no
[1:05:07] no no no no no no no no no no no no no
[1:05:10] not at all amen
[1:05:14] amen that's you this morning
[1:05:17] anyone who is in the line of duty this
[1:05:19] morning and has a revelation of the word
[1:05:22] for you that will come to pass amen and
[1:05:25] so he's given you everything that you
[1:05:27] have need of and so
[1:05:29] amen who they are and what their
[1:05:33] possession is is because of the
[1:05:35] revelation of Jesus Christ you never
[1:05:38] begun this journey it's he that did it
[1:05:40] if he did it then he is faithful to
[1:05:42] complete it and so everything you have
[1:05:45] need of he has given it to you and it's
[1:05:47] by Revelation that's why Revelation is
[1:05:49] the most important thing to the bride
[1:05:51] besides discernment amen and so God does
[1:05:56] not do anything halfway in his economy
[1:06:00] we don't have halfway method well we do
[1:06:03] have halfway message people
[1:06:05] but we have Brides who are this little
[1:06:10] this little and and some are mature amen
[1:06:13] but not all the way yet and so he
[1:06:16] doesn't do anything halfway he all he
[1:06:19] does he sees you in an infant form as a
[1:06:23] new creature in Christ knowing that
[1:06:25] you're going to grow into the fullness
[1:06:27] of the stature of the perfect man amen
[1:06:29] Hallelujah and so because you are a wife
[1:06:33] or a son or a daughter or a plumber or
[1:06:37] an electrician or a carpenter or
[1:06:38] whatever you are or a firefighter
[1:06:40] Hallelujah then he gave us the greatest
[1:06:45] thing that he could ever give
[1:06:48] foreign
[1:06:50] he gave us the word
[1:06:52] he said oh brother I knew you were going
[1:06:54] to say that well then then just jump on
[1:06:58] board amen
[1:07:01] [Music]
[1:07:02] because
[1:07:04] the weakest Christian
[1:07:09] the weakest Christian
[1:07:14] is able to have victory over every devil
[1:07:17] that's right
[1:07:18] the weakest Christian
[1:07:20] and so that looks like complete
[1:07:22] deliverance to me man
[1:07:24] amen and so when you use the word of God
[1:07:28] Amen then he brother Bram said he
[1:07:31] brought every Divine promise into reach
[1:07:34] of that weakest Christian
[1:07:36] amen because Jesus defeated Satan in the
[1:07:39] wilderness and it's all about the
[1:07:41] Revelation the word we really have to
[1:07:43] get away from thinking that this is
[1:07:46] revelation it's not this is revelation
[1:07:48] amen and so we're not in this number by
[1:07:52] a mental revelation we are in that
[1:07:54] number by a heart Revelation amen
[1:07:57] hallelujah and so it's it's been our way
[1:08:01] of thinking and doing things that gets
[1:08:03] we mix it up in our walk with God
[1:08:05] thinking you know because I had it too
[1:08:07] oh this is the way a message person does
[1:08:09] and then you get the Holy Spirit and it
[1:08:11] says well that's not the way a message
[1:08:13] person does the bride does it this way
[1:08:16] amen and so we get all those things
[1:08:19] mixed up with our walk with God Amen and
[1:08:22] that is why our life seems unfulfilled
[1:08:26] amen yeah
[1:08:27] amen because we've mixed too much of
[1:08:30] laodicean message Christianity
[1:08:34] and those don't mix
[1:08:36] amen
[1:08:38] Hallelujah God wants us to not flirt
[1:08:41] with those with those ideas those words
[1:08:44] those other ministers Who Don't Preach
[1:08:46] the word amen though they may be nice
[1:08:48] people but don't flirt with that amen
[1:08:50] and and that's the biggest hat we deal
[1:08:52] with a lot of Hispanic people and they
[1:08:54] have a very strong sense of loyalty and
[1:08:58] that's good and that's really bad
[1:09:01] it's good if they have a leader a pastor
[1:09:05] or a minister who has the word it's bad
[1:09:08] if they don't
[1:09:10] amen and so
[1:09:14] we need to know what the word says amen
[1:09:17] we need to know who our leader is amen
[1:09:19] and so we have to get the things out of
[1:09:23] our of our mind and our heart that we
[1:09:25] think is the message when a lot of times
[1:09:27] it's absolutely not so God desires his
[1:09:31] people to walk today in that total
[1:09:33] deliverance and and you all you have to
[1:09:36] do is stand up we could have a Jericho
[1:09:38] March and you'd be walking in total
[1:09:39] Deliverance
[1:09:40] I'm in the rich I don't I don't see it I
[1:09:43] don't feel it and God never ever ever
[1:09:45] ever said that that's the way you know
[1:09:48] that you're a believer
[1:09:50] amen and I'm not becoming a conservative
[1:09:53] Baptist
[1:09:55] because we're I'm too late I mean I've
[1:09:57] already we've already seen the
[1:09:58] supernatural
[1:09:59] but what I do know what is happening now
[1:10:02] is that I'm coming to the Revelation
[1:10:05] that all I have to do is personally just
[1:10:08] walk in the word and now it's Christ and
[1:10:11] me in that little room amen and so
[1:10:14] everything that I say or do according to
[1:10:16] the word I'm just sitting there watching
[1:10:18] it come to pass amen and you have the
[1:10:22] same opportunity this morning you and
[1:10:25] Christ together in the word amen and you
[1:10:27] can walk in that total Deliverance
[1:10:30] praise the Lord look at those in the
[1:10:32] Bible those who walked in complete
[1:10:34] Victory they were ordained they were
[1:10:37] designed to it
[1:10:39] praise the Lord you ordained you are
[1:10:42] designed to walk in that complete
[1:10:44] victory praise the Lord Jesus I like
[1:10:46] that word designs God demands you to
[1:10:49] walk in complete Victory praise the Lord
[1:10:52] and so you and I are living in that day
[1:10:54] when God has ordained us to live that
[1:10:56] victory for both the purpose of us being
[1:10:59] delivered but also that we could be the
[1:11:01] light of the world
[1:11:03] too many people let me go get my pastor
[1:11:06] he'll witness to you
[1:11:07] oh
[1:11:09] no not how it works so you've already
[1:11:12] witnessed to him
[1:11:15] because it's not your words it's who you
[1:11:18] are
[1:11:19] praise the Lord
[1:11:20] and so
[1:11:23] he wants you to walk in Deliverance and
[1:11:25] he wants you to be the light of the
[1:11:27] world Christ was the light of the world
[1:11:32] yes who are you
[1:11:34] you are you are a little Messiah
[1:11:38] you are Jesus Christ in flesh
[1:11:41] all right absolutely all right
[1:11:44] amen that's what the message says
[1:11:46] because you have who's in you
[1:11:50] and so if Christ is well brother I don't
[1:11:52] like to say it quite like that fine as
[1:11:56] long as you believe it
[1:11:57] right I don't care how you want to say
[1:12:00] it as long as you let him be it
[1:12:02] praise the Lord oh I love it amen and so
[1:12:07] he has ordained us to be that way God
[1:12:10] desires us to trust his word so much he
[1:12:14] wants to be trusted he wants to be the
[1:12:17] apple of your eye he wants you just to
[1:12:20] allow him to do whatever he wants to do
[1:12:22] in his word in your life amen he wants
[1:12:26] you to come into Fellowship in that
[1:12:28] inner chamber amen and let him have his
[1:12:32] way Hallelujah
[1:12:35] amen he wants us to have his attitude
[1:12:42] he's not sitting up there saying
[1:12:45] oh
[1:12:46] that's a big trial
[1:12:50] Satan that's whoa you really did a big
[1:12:54] one
[1:12:58] no
[1:13:00] he's he's that meat eater and he goes
[1:13:04] my son or daughter has a trial lord
[1:13:05] they're praying it's already done
[1:13:08] amen I've already delivered them I've
[1:13:11] already set them free amen his his
[1:13:14] attitude It's Already Done amen his
[1:13:17] attitude I've already sent my word and
[1:13:19] healed them and delivered them from
[1:13:20] their destructions amen and so he wants
[1:13:23] us to trust him and have that kind of
[1:13:25] attitude in him for him and his word
[1:13:28] amen
[1:13:29] and so our walk with God this morning is
[1:13:32] about yielding our will to his will
[1:13:36] which is his word
[1:13:40] this morning he placed you in a local
[1:13:42] body
[1:13:45] why do you do that
[1:13:47] well you know so I can come and hear the
[1:13:49] word and have some fellowship
[1:13:52] that's part of it
[1:13:55] but he placed you in a local body so
[1:13:57] that you could he could train you to
[1:14:00] yield your will to the will of God Amen
[1:14:03] amen so that you can become useful to
[1:14:07] the body
[1:14:08] amen and so whatever he tells you to do
[1:14:13] then as we surrender to his will then we
[1:14:16] can live the word become useful to the
[1:14:18] local body
[1:14:19] and so the more we get ourselves out of
[1:14:21] the way this morning amen the more
[1:14:23] Christ will the more people will see
[1:14:26] Christ in US amen praise the Lord see
[1:14:29] it's always 80 percent of the people uh
[1:14:32] 20 of the people only do well how does
[1:14:34] it go again
[1:14:35] only
[1:14:37] do 80 of the work is that right
[1:14:40] and and that's you know sometimes people
[1:14:43] just can't help but when it comes to a
[1:14:46] body we can't have that
[1:14:49] amen and and we're going to see that in
[1:14:51] a little bit you're going to say you
[1:14:53] really descended into a carnal line of
[1:14:56] thought here amen
[1:14:58] it's the message don't worry
[1:15:01] see we need to get ourselves out of the
[1:15:03] way so that we can be Christ to those
[1:15:06] around us amen
[1:15:08] and we need to get ourselves yielded to
[1:15:10] the word so his word God's mind could
[1:15:13] become our thinking amen
[1:15:16] and so because we are in laodicea the
[1:15:20] word gets pushed to the side in our mind
[1:15:23] and our own will becomes engaged and has
[1:15:27] the preeminence amen and and our own
[1:15:30] will can look pretty and religious right
[1:15:33] but but we we have to wash that with the
[1:15:37] word of God we have to filter it in
[1:15:39] God's thinking man's filter to make sure
[1:15:42] that those things don't take place and
[1:15:44] so if we're a part of God then his he
[1:15:48] desires that this Union amen between he
[1:15:52] and yourself be your confession
[1:15:57] yeah right
[1:15:59] how'd you like to go home to a wife that
[1:16:01] never said she loved you
[1:16:05] no
[1:16:07] no no not at all
[1:16:09] amen well
[1:16:11] she says well he just knows I do
[1:16:14] does he
[1:16:16] I don't know does he
[1:16:19] see our relationship with him we have to
[1:16:23] let him know that we love him
[1:16:25] amen and so and that's where this quote
[1:16:29] God just doesn't pick you up by the
[1:16:31] caller and drop you into his will we
[1:16:34] must have faith in the word we must have
[1:16:36] it up on our lips speaking it and going
[1:16:38] forward amen hallelujah and we we can't
[1:16:42] expect to see taste fill smell or hear
[1:16:45] anything or even have any Sensations
[1:16:47] amen but we should believe it and watch
[1:16:50] it come to pass amen hallelujah but the
[1:16:53] farther people get away from cultivating
[1:16:55] the word in their life the easier it is
[1:16:58] for the devil to gain grounds in good
[1:17:02] people
[1:17:04] right
[1:17:05] Ephesians 4 27.
[1:17:09] it's not a long one
[1:17:12] Ephesians 4 27.
[1:17:19] neither give place to the devil
[1:17:22] that's all
[1:17:25] do you realize that's all Christ did in
[1:17:27] the wilderness
[1:17:29] he just didn't give place to him amen
[1:17:32] and so
[1:17:34] with the revelation of the word that we
[1:17:36] have amen we we we have seen that we do
[1:17:41] not have to obey any thought impulse or
[1:17:46] feeling that the devil brings
[1:17:49] even when you've been diagnosed with
[1:17:51] something
[1:17:53] and the doctors are so confident I've
[1:17:55] been there
[1:17:57] oh you're gonna have open heart surgery
[1:17:58] today you have you have vtac and and
[1:18:01] that's a block rhythm in your heart and
[1:18:03] you you go get prepared for open heart
[1:18:06] surgery
[1:18:09] we went home and prayed with our parents
[1:18:13] hands were laid upon me
[1:18:16] and I recovered amen so much that the
[1:18:19] cardiologist asked me goes what kind of
[1:18:21] a doctor did you say this was
[1:18:24] he goes your heart is pristine
[1:18:29] I didn't do that he did this Hallelujah
[1:18:34] amen and so I I'm not obeying the
[1:18:37] symptoms I'm not obeying the
[1:18:40] circumstance I'm not obeying those
[1:18:42] things well Brother Rich you're just a
[1:18:44] rebel amen
[1:18:45] no when it comes to that then you have
[1:18:48] to be you rebel against the faults you
[1:18:51] rebel against the unbelief you you you
[1:18:53] cast down all those imaginations amen so
[1:18:57] that you can focus this morning on this
[1:19:01] word do we believe the message or do we
[1:19:03] not
[1:19:05] amen and so since you do then let's jump
[1:19:08] in amen
[1:19:10] Hallelujah see the devil can only take
[1:19:13] from you what you give him
[1:19:16] oh that's so easy to say brother
[1:19:21] we could be here all day with trials
[1:19:23] that we could testify right
[1:19:25] amen let's see
[1:19:28] we have in our growth process we've
[1:19:30] given him ground
[1:19:32] amen
[1:19:34] Hallelujah but see we we do we get sick
[1:19:37] we we are given Trials of our faith yeah
[1:19:40] as a Christian you're already delivered
[1:19:42] but we have to grow into that we have to
[1:19:45] find that that's why God does different
[1:19:47] things for different people at different
[1:19:49] stages of their growth
[1:19:51] he will be more Supernatural to somebody
[1:19:54] usually in their younger years of the
[1:19:57] faith and then as you grow he's still
[1:19:59] Supernatural but he will he will let you
[1:20:02] stand on the word amen and the same
[1:20:04] results will happen amen but you groan
[1:20:08] amen
[1:20:09] hallelujah amen and so so we can never
[1:20:14] take background
[1:20:16] we have surrendered on our own we can't
[1:20:18] do it
[1:20:19] in our flesh
[1:20:22] your
[1:20:23] Spirit realm not your soul your spirit
[1:20:26] realm and your flesh can never take back
[1:20:28] surrender ground you can't do it
[1:20:31] because that would be self-righteousness
[1:20:35] so it must be
[1:20:38] God and the word
[1:20:41] in prayer
[1:20:42] that's what takes back that ground amen
[1:20:44] because the devil's a bluff
[1:20:47] and but it takes the revelation of Jesus
[1:20:49] Christ and his word to move off what is
[1:20:53] yours amen the Devil is a squatter he
[1:20:56] might be squatting on your flesh he
[1:20:58] might be squatting on your career he
[1:21:00] might be squatting on the revelation of
[1:21:03] who you're going to marry amen
[1:21:04] hallelujah amen don't don't settle for
[1:21:07] some good looking this or that who cares
[1:21:10] because in a few years they're going to
[1:21:11] get like me
[1:21:16] right
[1:21:18] some people are blessed with more hair
[1:21:20] I'm not amen
[1:21:22] but all those things will go away it has
[1:21:26] to be the holy spirit amen and so if if
[1:21:29] if getting married is part of of your
[1:21:34] desire then what does the word say the
[1:21:36] word says whatsoever things you ask and
[1:21:39] no doubt
[1:21:41] you mean God cares about that absolutely
[1:21:44] he does Amen so the devil's about but
[1:21:47] let's turn to Second Corinthians 10 3-5
[1:21:52] the Devil is a bluff
[1:21:55] he is a bluff
[1:21:57] and and he has been on me and my family
[1:22:01] the whole week
[1:22:03] and
[1:22:06] there was a thought where I was going to
[1:22:08] cancel
[1:22:10] that I remember brother woosley who some
[1:22:12] of you don't really know but
[1:22:14] he was God literally told him to go
[1:22:17] preach at a certain Church well he went
[1:22:20] down to that church and he got so sick
[1:22:23] he was vomiting for 24 hours
[1:22:26] and so he he went to the pulpit
[1:22:29] nauseated he goes I'm gonna go
[1:22:32] and I'm gonna I'm just because God told
[1:22:34] me to he got in the Pulpit all the
[1:22:36] symptoms left
[1:22:38] yeah he was out and he said it was just
[1:22:40] strange that was probably the the best
[1:22:43] message at that church that he was God
[1:22:45] ever allowed him to preach
[1:22:48] and then he got out of the pulpit and he
[1:22:50] got nauseated again but then it left
[1:22:52] amen
[1:22:53] but it's like and so why would we let
[1:22:56] circumstances take us out of church on
[1:22:59] Wednesdays and Sundays well brother I
[1:23:01] have company and you know no I don't
[1:23:04] really know
[1:23:05] that at my house they're gonna stay and
[1:23:08] eat my potato chips and drink my pop and
[1:23:10] we're going to church
[1:23:13] right
[1:23:15] yeah see don't don't use those excuses
[1:23:17] well my family's here amen well sister
[1:23:19] Diana's family's here and they're here
[1:23:21] amen praise the Lord so don't use that
[1:23:24] kind of excuse amen right and so we
[1:23:27] don't want that but see in second
[1:23:28] Corinthians 10 3-5 it says for though we
[1:23:31] walk in the flesh we do not war after
[1:23:33] the flesh for the weapons of our Warfare
[1:23:36] they are not carnal for they they're not
[1:23:39] carnal but they are Mighty through God
[1:23:41] to the pulling down of strongholds
[1:23:43] casting down the imaginations and every
[1:23:46] High thing that exalttheth itself
[1:23:48] against the knowledge of God and
[1:23:50] bringing in captivity every thought to
[1:23:53] The Obedience of Christ
[1:23:54] amen and so Abraham and Sarah they
[1:23:58] prepared for the child well they made a
[1:24:01] lot of mistakes on the way but you know
[1:24:02] what you God doesn't even count that to
[1:24:05] their account
[1:24:07] he says they were faithful amen and so
[1:24:10] don't let the devil sit here and tell
[1:24:12] you because you've had some unbelief but
[1:24:15] it's his unbelief amen don't let the
[1:24:17] devil tell you that God's never going to
[1:24:19] give that to you amen because he will
[1:24:21] give it to you because you're in the
[1:24:23] line of duty
[1:24:25] praise the Lord
[1:24:27] we are completely dependent upon God
[1:24:31] that's all I can say Amen well he's
[1:24:35] saying because you're old
[1:24:36] no when you're young you're completely
[1:24:38] dependent upon God Amen wow
[1:24:42] what happened to the time
[1:24:44] you guys all right
[1:24:46] like Brother Bear he goes you all right
[1:24:48] you all right okay okay
[1:24:50] amen
[1:24:53] everyday people walk right over the word
[1:24:57] whether intellectual
[1:24:59] whether intentional
[1:25:01] non-intentional
[1:25:04] yet God still says
[1:25:06] yeah that didn't feel very good but I
[1:25:09] still want you to know me
[1:25:11] yes sir and and to know somebody is to
[1:25:14] be intimate right in that respect and so
[1:25:16] we want we want him to know us and I
[1:25:21] want to know him the correct way
[1:25:23] hallelujah look at a lot of good people
[1:25:25] get caught up in the cares of this life
[1:25:26] well my job and and you know I'm I have
[1:25:30] to be off and and have to go do this and
[1:25:33] you know it's it's because I'm providing
[1:25:35] for my family amen and so
[1:25:38] and what happens is they get so far into
[1:25:41] what they are doing
[1:25:44] or they get so far into their problem
[1:25:46] have you ever talked to people where no
[1:25:50] matter what you say it always comes back
[1:25:51] to the issue of their problem and it's
[1:25:54] just like yeah I mean they need somebody
[1:25:56] to listen to them but at the same time
[1:25:58] you're exhausted when you leave because
[1:26:00] because they really don't want to be
[1:26:03] delivered amen
[1:26:04] Hallelujah But but so they're into what
[1:26:07] is happening to them instead of what God
[1:26:10] has already done and the word gets
[1:26:13] pushed away that old song says sin will
[1:26:15] take you farther than you want to go and
[1:26:17] so you yield to those things and you
[1:26:20] watch that devil just pull you around by
[1:26:22] by uh that ring through your nose amen
[1:26:25] and a rope
[1:26:26] II Peter 3 17.
[1:26:42] ye therefore beloved seen ye know these
[1:26:46] things before but where lest he also
[1:26:50] being led away with the heir of the
[1:26:52] wicked fall from your own steadfastness
[1:26:54] amen so we have to be careful be careful
[1:26:58] who you fellowship with
[1:27:01] amen when you make a stand for the word
[1:27:04] not in your personality not be not
[1:27:07] because you're trying to hurt somebody's
[1:27:08] feelings but you make a stand for the
[1:27:11] word and other people who are not as
[1:27:13] convinced will probably not be your
[1:27:15] friend anymore
[1:27:18] you bet you have to watch those things
[1:27:20] you can't be flirting with Spirits amen
[1:27:24] uh we're not even see we're so far down
[1:27:27] the road we're not I'm not even talking
[1:27:28] about Pentecostal methodists I'm talking
[1:27:30] about message people you have to be
[1:27:33] careful who you are around because they
[1:27:36] are caring Spirit spirits of adultery
[1:27:40] the spiritual and the natural is the
[1:27:43] same spirit and so you're mixing your
[1:27:46] kids up with them or yourself
[1:27:48] and it's not because you look down on
[1:27:50] them that is not the reason but you have
[1:27:53] to watch what is happening amen
[1:27:55] amen you have to offer the olives branch
[1:27:58] of the truth and the spirit all the time
[1:28:00] amen but you can't let that mixing go on
[1:28:04] in that respect amen because if if you
[1:28:07] either love your kids or you don't
[1:28:10] Hallelujah I'm not telling you to
[1:28:12] separate from people but I'm telling you
[1:28:14] to be on guard amen amen and so for God
[1:28:18] to give his church a Deliverance they
[1:28:21] must be personally unified each
[1:28:24] individual has to be unified with Jesus
[1:28:26] Christ look at Joshua and Caleb they
[1:28:29] were unified together well yeah they're
[1:28:31] buddies and they did everything
[1:28:34] they had a revelation of the word
[1:28:36] they had a revelation of what Jehovah
[1:28:38] wanted amen that's how come they knew
[1:28:41] they were delivered 40 years before the
[1:28:43] rest Hallelujah and so for God to have
[1:28:46] victory in our churches we must be a
[1:28:49] unified body in the church
[1:28:52] amen we're to pray for one another in
[1:28:55] the church
[1:28:57] amen
[1:29:00] amen devil hates Unity
[1:29:03] amen
[1:29:06] he can't work in bodies where we're
[1:29:08] unified there's a difference between
[1:29:10] agreeing with one another and being
[1:29:13] Unified
[1:29:14] you don't have to like their behavior
[1:29:17] we help this uh she was a drug addict
[1:29:20] and and I knew she was because we worked
[1:29:22] around drug addicts all her life but I
[1:29:24] felt like God wanted us to take her to
[1:29:26] where she wanted to go so charity and I
[1:29:28] loaded her up and you know she's back
[1:29:30] there Don I'm just like I'm just sitting
[1:29:33] there I don't believe you you know and
[1:29:36] myself
[1:29:38] but and so that's hard for they said you
[1:29:40] would help her even though you don't
[1:29:42] believe her well absolutely
[1:29:44] because God told me to that's exactly
[1:29:47] right
[1:29:48] so and so I don't have to agree with you
[1:29:50] to like you
[1:29:52] even at the fire service that's a
[1:29:55] revelation
[1:29:56] but how come it's not in message
[1:29:58] churches
[1:29:59] you don't believe
[1:30:02] then I'm not gonna come for dessert
[1:30:04] anymore
[1:30:06] all right you're missing out
[1:30:09] amen do you see it's God looks at that
[1:30:13] as they have diapers and a big old
[1:30:15] bottle
[1:30:21] maybe that's just in Oregon I don't know
[1:30:24] [Music]
[1:30:26] amen
[1:30:28] but see
[1:30:30] he wants us to truly love one another
[1:30:33] love does not have to agree
[1:30:37] he wants us to pray for one another and
[1:30:39] for us to go on to with God as a body we
[1:30:42] all have to be unified in the same fight
[1:30:45] fighting the good fight of faith amen
[1:30:48] and so and so people think oh if I could
[1:30:51] just get to that big church oh it's so
[1:30:55] wonderful and they have all this and
[1:30:56] that amen do you realize that usually a
[1:30:59] big church means that God has left the
[1:31:03] people
[1:31:04] that's my opinion
[1:31:09] not everybody so don't look at me like
[1:31:12] that
[1:31:13] foreign
[1:31:14] you're thinking well you're just saying
[1:31:17] that because you have a small Church
[1:31:18] absolutely not I I never want a big
[1:31:20] church
[1:31:22] but but why but you say well why would
[1:31:25] you say that then because growth
[1:31:29] and perceived Revelation still grows
[1:31:32] when people have left God
[1:31:35] I can sit here all day and give you all
[1:31:37] the negative about every Big Church in
[1:31:40] this message
[1:31:42] and the disunity and the hatred
[1:31:46] yeah we look up to some of those right
[1:31:49] and and forget anything out this week
[1:31:51] let's just think back
[1:31:53] the other way
[1:31:54] right
[1:31:56] but we think oh it must be glorious to
[1:31:59] be there
[1:32:02] but see
[1:32:04] when when we don't allow Unity to come
[1:32:07] in then the devil just go okay I'm going
[1:32:09] to bring more members
[1:32:11] I'm going to bring more programs I'm
[1:32:12] going to bring better music better
[1:32:14] musicians amen the whole thing
[1:32:16] Hallelujah and so
[1:32:18] but see but see some and this is not all
[1:32:23] the time so
[1:32:24] but look at the smaller churches let's
[1:32:27] say 200 or less
[1:32:29] I'm just throwing out a number
[1:32:31] you're going to see a more unified group
[1:32:36] usually
[1:32:37] like say these are generalities but it's
[1:32:39] I'm trying to make a point is that just
[1:32:41] because a church is big does not mean
[1:32:43] God is with him
[1:32:45] amen and just because there's three
[1:32:47] doesn't mean God's with them amen but
[1:32:50] see we must be unified Around Jesus
[1:32:53] Christ to fight that good fight of Faith
[1:32:55] amen because in the wilderness in Moses
[1:32:59] mega church of two million people there
[1:33:02] was two besides himself of the original
[1:33:06] and then
[1:33:08] and they still had all the signs and
[1:33:10] wonders working
[1:33:14] Hallelujah yet they were spiritually
[1:33:17] dead amen
[1:33:19] Hallelujah and so and and I like it I've
[1:33:22] been in churches of 12 to 15 000 and
[1:33:25] when they when you sing
[1:33:28] the good old songs of Zion Oh it's just
[1:33:31] beautiful isn't it it's awesome I love
[1:33:34] it and so
[1:33:36] all I know is that God poured out his
[1:33:39] Blessing on those Israelites in the
[1:33:41] wilderness and they were all spiritually
[1:33:43] dead so I want you to think this morning
[1:33:45] God's Prosperity is different than what
[1:33:48] we think Prosperity is
[1:33:50] even natural prosperity and and I think
[1:33:53] that still pours over the message oh man
[1:33:56] it's just you know God's really blessing
[1:33:58] us we're able to get this new boat and
[1:34:00] this one-time Diesel and this and that
[1:34:02] and this and that and that it's like
[1:34:04] that's good because those are awesome
[1:34:07] things to have but but it that is really
[1:34:10] not prosperity and it's in its purest
[1:34:13] form and so God's Prosperity is
[1:34:16] different amen because in his
[1:34:19] relationship to the church so churches
[1:34:22] may get bigger amen but if they're not
[1:34:25] prospering in Christ then there's
[1:34:27] disunity amen so First Corinthians 5 6
[1:34:31] it says
[1:34:32] your glory is not good I got to speed
[1:34:35] this up
[1:34:36] your glory is not good know ye not that
[1:34:39] A little leaven leaveneth the whole lump
[1:34:41] amen and so as a church body we should
[1:34:45] sacrifice our thoughts
[1:34:49] about something that the majority has
[1:34:51] voted on
[1:34:54] that hits home doesn't it
[1:34:56] I don't know what's going on here but
[1:34:58] most churches
[1:34:59] when the majority votes and it doesn't
[1:35:01] go our way it's like
[1:35:04] thank you
[1:35:05] you get into the car and it's like oh
[1:35:13] bed
[1:35:16] no brother Brown says do not do that
[1:35:20] Hallelujah we have to he says he said
[1:35:24] when they decide to build the new
[1:35:25] Tabernacle he was completely against
[1:35:27] that
[1:35:28] but he came and seen how the people
[1:35:30] wanted it he goes I had to give up my
[1:35:32] thought
[1:35:34] s Allelujah so we need to keep the unity
[1:35:38] amen and don't keep complaining about it
[1:35:41] well the pastor wanted it this is all
[1:35:43] brother Paul
[1:35:48] no that's right if if you see people
[1:35:52] don't understand Ministry at all
[1:35:55] uh the other day someone said
[1:35:57] man I wish I could be a pastor
[1:36:01] because they happen to see the teeny
[1:36:05] little
[1:36:06] check that I get
[1:36:09] I'm teeny
[1:36:13] and I'm thinking yeah it's like
[1:36:15] no you just I almost want to say father
[1:36:18] forgive him they don't know what they're
[1:36:19] doing
[1:36:20] because they really don't they don't
[1:36:22] know you just don't wake up on Sunday oh
[1:36:24] I'm gonna go over here and print this
[1:36:26] message out and I'm going to go up there
[1:36:27] and move around a little bit get him
[1:36:29] excited no
[1:36:31] sir
[1:36:33] and so
[1:36:36] we're to sacrifice our thoughts and so
[1:36:39] if the church votes on something
[1:36:43] how about showing up for a work day
[1:36:46] how about showing up and actually doing
[1:36:48] work on this church
[1:36:50] amen
[1:36:52] I'm just saying I I was see and this is
[1:36:55] confession time
[1:36:57] we had a church work day that we had
[1:36:59] planned uh about a month ago
[1:37:03] that Spirit of pests and or unbelief I'm
[1:37:07] going I kept going to change no one's
[1:37:09] going to show up anyway no one's gonna
[1:37:11] do this no one's going to do that and
[1:37:13] then the work date came and I was like
[1:37:16] Wow even even one of the brothers who
[1:37:19] hasn't hadn't come for two years showed
[1:37:22] up
[1:37:22] foreign
[1:37:26] I'm sorry Lord
[1:37:30] amen I said this is how it should be
[1:37:32] amen hallelujah this is good amen and so
[1:37:37] God had me eat my words amen which I'm
[1:37:40] glad he did amen and so the more
[1:37:44] see we need to get behind the decisions
[1:37:47] we need to put our the old uh saying Put
[1:37:49] Your Shoulder to the wheel we need to
[1:37:51] get because that brings units he doesn't
[1:37:53] it and you get to eat free food probably
[1:37:55] amen
[1:37:57] and so the more unified We Stand Amen
[1:38:01] brother bam said it will be Unlimited in
[1:38:03] what God can do in your midst
[1:38:06] you mean because I show up for a work
[1:38:08] day
[1:38:10] that's what he said
[1:38:12] that's what he said not me
[1:38:16] see we want to put carnal over here we
[1:38:19] think in spiritual over here when it's
[1:38:21] all spiritual and so
[1:38:24] for us to be unified as well we must be
[1:38:27] unified around the word of God
[1:38:29] amen and so if a church allows Ministry
[1:38:33] to not preach the word of God but their
[1:38:35] own opinion
[1:38:36] I don't care if you're 15
[1:38:39] 000. members
[1:38:41] you will never be Unified
[1:38:44] because the words not being preached
[1:38:46] there that's exactly right oh brother
[1:38:48] but they get most of it right
[1:38:51] I'm gonna throw up
[1:38:54] don't give me that
[1:38:56] that that's trash
[1:38:58] amen can God change them absolutely
[1:39:02] but as long as they're off the word
[1:39:03] those people are open to an adulterous
[1:39:07] spirit amen that's why you choose your
[1:39:10] church by Revelation and the word of God
[1:39:12] amen amen hallelujah and so you choose
[1:39:16] it to where you know that you're going
[1:39:18] to hear the word of God Amen praise the
[1:39:20] Lord Jesus
[1:39:21] praise the Lord and so if if that
[1:39:24] Ministry is preaching their own opinion
[1:39:26] then you're in trouble and so if someone
[1:39:29] and here's the other thing in your
[1:39:31] church if someone makes a mistake or
[1:39:33] they get hurt or offended for some
[1:39:35] reason then let everybody look around
[1:39:38] and pray for them or give them a card
[1:39:41] this is not about the pastor being the
[1:39:44] only one to show up this is about all of
[1:39:47] us as a body Ministry
[1:39:49] we are here to to try to make things
[1:39:53] right for the glory of God because we
[1:39:55] want unity in the brethren
[1:39:57] amen I've been trying to
[1:39:59] keep open communication to
[1:40:01] some people for years
[1:40:04] and during covet actually opened up a
[1:40:07] little bit it was good
[1:40:08] but you know they
[1:40:11] they just can't get over a couple things
[1:40:13] and I'm going God I you know I already
[1:40:16] apologize I never meant for this to
[1:40:18] happen because I love them but it's like
[1:40:21] God please let somebody be used to give
[1:40:24] them the word of God because I can't now
[1:40:27] because I've you know somehow messed up
[1:40:31] and so
[1:40:32] if we want the body of Christ
[1:40:37] if we want his Unity
[1:40:40] of the body in Christ in our midst amen
[1:40:44] then we have to get away from
[1:40:47] condemnation
[1:40:49] amen
[1:40:50] stop letting the devil condemn you
[1:40:53] that is not an attribute of a Christian
[1:40:59] amen in First John 3 19.
[1:41:03] because when he has you condemned then
[1:41:07] God's not going to hear your prayer
[1:41:13] First John 3 19-21 that's right
[1:41:17] and hereby we know that we are of the
[1:41:19] truth and all and shall assure our
[1:41:22] hearts before him for if our heart
[1:41:24] condemn us God is greater than our heart
[1:41:28] and and knoweth all things
[1:41:31] beloved if our heart condemn us not then
[1:41:35] we have confidence towards God and so if
[1:41:39] we allow God will spank us and that's
[1:41:42] called conviction
[1:41:43] and if we allow him to do that because
[1:41:45] conviction always points to life
[1:41:48] condemnation is always death amen and so
[1:41:52] if if we cast down that imagination
[1:41:54] thinking yeah I'm not a very good
[1:41:56] Christian brother Bram says don't you
[1:41:58] even let those words come out of your
[1:42:00] mouth amen praise the Lord
[1:42:03] and so
[1:42:04] this is why we all need to confess those
[1:42:07] things to God that are not the word
[1:42:09] that's why when you come to communion
[1:42:11] that's a good time to do that amen we
[1:42:14] want only the word in our life and so we
[1:42:16] need Unity with God Amen so that we have
[1:42:19] Unity with one another this morning and
[1:42:22] so we want complete uh Deliverance then
[1:42:25] we have to have complete repentance amen
[1:42:27] Hallelujah and so we want to have unity
[1:42:31] in this local body so that when people
[1:42:34] are in need who come into this place
[1:42:36] then they can get deliverance and
[1:42:39] because if the body is disunified then
[1:42:42] people come in here and and according to
[1:42:45] the message uh they they will not be
[1:42:48] healed
[1:42:50] you mean God would do that
[1:42:53] absolutely
[1:42:54] amen
[1:42:57] why because you are Jesus's hands feet
[1:43:02] mouth you are all of that amen we are we
[1:43:07] are bone of his bone flesh of his flesh
[1:43:09] amen Christ is on the inside and so look
[1:43:13] at brother round says just look at what
[1:43:15] God does in our current condition and so
[1:43:17] I can say that look at what God does
[1:43:19] Even in our midst right now just think
[1:43:22] how it would be if we all actually were
[1:43:25] in unity with one another
[1:43:28] oh hallelujah praise the Lord amen and
[1:43:32] so we like for that the the people of
[1:43:37] God Amen if they are to take the land of
[1:43:40] the promises of God today then they had
[1:43:43] to be in unity then under Joshua the
[1:43:46] Holy Ghost and and today under the
[1:43:48] leadership of the Holy Ghost and the
[1:43:50] word we have to be under Unity to take
[1:43:53] all the promises of this word as well
[1:43:56] praise the Lord
[1:43:58] we just have to surrender all of our
[1:44:00] parts
[1:44:01] amen we're almost done praise the Lord
[1:44:05] you don't have to change the CD or hope
[1:44:07] or a DVD
[1:44:09] I know that's old technology
[1:44:14] see
[1:44:16] Moses had a revelation of the word
[1:44:19] and Pharaoh wanted him to leave the
[1:44:22] animals and some of the people he goes
[1:44:24] now I'm not sorry
[1:44:27] I'm not the word says that we're going
[1:44:30] out
[1:44:31] oh we don't leave any person and so
[1:44:33] that's why when when as a body when
[1:44:36] people are praying for something a need
[1:44:37] in their life I don't care how small or
[1:44:40] big we're just saying Lord we're gonna
[1:44:42] we're gonna believe until we see that
[1:44:44] for that brother or that sister amen
[1:44:46] and so we have to claim and to possess
[1:44:52] all parts of that word is ours amen
[1:44:54] hallelujah and when you do that you put
[1:44:57] the devil on the Run amen and as you
[1:45:00] claim it by Revelation by faith in the
[1:45:03] word then you keep him on the Run amen
[1:45:06] you have the token applied to your home
[1:45:09] and the devil's defeated in that home
[1:45:11] amen hallelujah praise the Lord Jesus
[1:45:14] and so Moses was under Unity
[1:45:18] and this is why God has to send a send a
[1:45:20] prophet Moses was in unity with God
[1:45:23] Israelites weren't
[1:45:25] God sent a prophet in our day
[1:45:27] he was under Unity with God we weren't
[1:45:30] yet
[1:45:32] but when Moses had the Revelation from
[1:45:36] God to apply the blood that blood
[1:45:38] brought all Israel under unity and when
[1:45:42] God allowed our the prophet of this day
[1:45:45] to preach the revelation of Jesus Christ
[1:45:48] to us the opening of the word amen it
[1:45:51] brought us the bride under all of that
[1:45:55] word the bloody word amen praise the
[1:45:58] lord we are we are now covered we're
[1:46:01] under Unity of Jesus Christ amen
[1:46:04] hallelujah
[1:46:07] praise the Lord Jesus
[1:46:09] all of our
[1:46:10] all of our mornings you realize the the
[1:46:13] head of your that you have this morning
[1:46:16] praise the Lord Jesus
[1:46:18] amen all who are under your roof they
[1:46:22] are protected by your prayers and the
[1:46:25] holy spirit amen praise the Lord
[1:46:30] when everything is under the blood you
[1:46:32] are set free
[1:46:34] amen
[1:46:36] you can't bring things that are not God
[1:46:38] under the blood you can't do it amen you
[1:46:40] just has to be the word and when that
[1:46:43] happens then we have a peace that passes
[1:46:46] any of our understanding because it's
[1:46:48] God's peace it is not our peace it's not
[1:46:51] worldly peace worldly peace is that the
[1:46:54] stock market always grows and that my
[1:46:56] retirement fund I'm just going woohoo I
[1:46:59] can see it going up you know no that's
[1:47:01] not that's not God's peace God's peace
[1:47:04] is oh no there goes the stock market
[1:47:06] again
[1:47:08] amen Lord you provided for me before I
[1:47:11] was saved you provided right now you've
[1:47:13] provided all my life and whatever
[1:47:15] happens you are in full control
[1:47:20] when nobody else is working you will
[1:47:23] work
[1:47:29] if you're in the Philippines
[1:47:31] you pay your ties give offerings
[1:47:34] no one has chickens
[1:47:38] you have two or three
[1:47:40] amen
[1:47:42] he said oh wait a minute brother
[1:47:45] no wait a minute brothers and sisters
[1:47:48] what does Malachi 3 or 3 say
[1:47:51] he promises to destroy the Devourer for
[1:47:55] your sake
[1:47:56] if you would just tithe is just
[1:47:59] obligatory
[1:48:01] so don't even talk to me about tithe
[1:48:04] He blesses you in your offerings
[1:48:08] as well and more up to a hundred fold
[1:48:13] that's exactly right
[1:48:16] listen to the message
[1:48:18] this is not that that Doctrine did
[1:48:21] didn't all of a sudden show up in the
[1:48:23] 20th and you know around 2000
[1:48:30] probably you don't know how hard it is
[1:48:32] to make ends meet
[1:48:34] yes I do
[1:48:39] sure do
[1:48:41] well
[1:48:42] you know I'm
[1:48:44] I just
[1:48:45] I don't know whether I should tithe on
[1:48:47] my net or my gross
[1:48:50] well do you want a net blessing or a
[1:48:52] gross blessing
[1:48:56] he'll do either one so why not just go a
[1:48:59] little higher
[1:49:00] and this is not because we need your
[1:49:02] money because actually I don't
[1:49:06] know but what here's what you need you
[1:49:09] need to have protection
[1:49:11] and that gives it
[1:49:14] what didn't we just hear it he will
[1:49:18] rebuke the Devourer for you
[1:49:20] that's part of the word
[1:49:22] amen let's get off that so we can get
[1:49:24] done amen
[1:49:26] so
[1:49:30] we will have a peace in our life and our
[1:49:34] families that we don't even understand
[1:49:40] Christ himself was so completely
[1:49:42] delivered into the hands of God
[1:49:45] you say well yeah because he was God
[1:49:47] no no no no no he was flesh
[1:49:52] and if Christ is our example this
[1:49:54] morning
[1:49:55] then we should put all of ourselves in
[1:49:57] the hands of God as well
[1:49:59] say I don't do anything until the father
[1:50:02] shows me that's why our decisions slow
[1:50:04] down amen and because there's a lot of
[1:50:07] times when
[1:50:08] oh just just think of this let me just
[1:50:12] you I won't mention but what what is
[1:50:15] something that you really want
[1:50:17] and when you start talking about it what
[1:50:20] does your flesh get like
[1:50:22] it gets tingly doesn't it it's like
[1:50:26] or you start and then then you just read
[1:50:28] about it all the time and you start
[1:50:30] dreaming about it and so your emotions
[1:50:33] and your flesh it's like man
[1:50:36] God must really want me to have this
[1:50:39] God please cut it off if I'm not
[1:50:41] supposed to have it
[1:50:43] well he'd do that if you truly meant it
[1:50:47] but see
[1:50:49] foreign
[1:50:52] Christ surrendered all of his natural
[1:50:55] parts
[1:51:00] he gave his own will even
[1:51:05] and you may not agree with this but it's
[1:51:08] in it's in the message
[1:51:10] that is what allowed Christ to go to the
[1:51:13] Cross that's right
[1:51:15] what
[1:51:16] absolutely that's the truth
[1:51:19] amen he surrendered
[1:51:23] brother around said he wanted to stay
[1:51:25] with his friends so bad
[1:51:28] why do you think he was sweating great
[1:51:30] drops of blood
[1:51:32] he said I I don't my flesh I don't want
[1:51:35] to go I want to stay
[1:51:38] but see
[1:51:39] we had to have a testimony
[1:51:42] that he was Victorious over his own will
[1:51:48] so that we can be victorious over our
[1:51:52] will amen
[1:51:53] and that is hard
[1:51:56] I got both legs up hey man both arms it
[1:52:00] is very very hard
[1:52:02] but
[1:52:03] you can do it amen amen amen and so when
[1:52:07] we come to the end of our life we just
[1:52:09] want those around us to say
[1:52:12] there's a real Christian that's right
[1:52:15] and more importantly I want him to say
[1:52:17] welcome
[1:52:19] I trusted you your whole life and now
[1:52:22] come and be with me amen come receive
[1:52:25] your hair amen hallelujah conversate
[1:52:28] receive a body that's 60 pounds lighter
[1:52:31] amen come oh when my father died my wife
[1:52:35] never told me about this until recently
[1:52:36] but the night or whenever I had taken
[1:52:39] off of work and I was there
[1:52:41] uh they called me from work and I was
[1:52:43] there when my dad passed away and when
[1:52:46] he took his last breath or so
[1:52:48] my wife said that she was praying and
[1:52:51] all of a sudden she heard my dad
[1:52:53] just laughing right
[1:52:56] running because he always talked about
[1:52:59] the The Meadows and he wanted us to run
[1:53:02] and jump
[1:53:04] and it was like
[1:53:05] but she goes I forgot to tell you and
[1:53:08] it's like Oh Praise the Lord he was
[1:53:11] released from that stroke body just
[1:53:14] running he was glad that he let God have
[1:53:18] his way amen
[1:53:20] praise the Lord Jesus we come to the end
[1:53:23] of our life we want God to say there's
[1:53:25] my girl there's my boy
[1:53:27] Hallelujah so Christ he he totally
[1:53:31] delivered you the Church of the Living
[1:53:34] God at that cross that atonement that he
[1:53:37] provided is things that are already
[1:53:39] given to you this morning amen musicians
[1:53:43] Christ at Calvary put everything under
[1:53:46] his feet so that you as his wife would
[1:53:49] be free from all of these circumstances
[1:53:52] amen
[1:53:56] amen that doctors are good medications
[1:54:00] can be good but
[1:54:03] just
[1:54:04] just put God first though that's what
[1:54:06] I'm saying amen
[1:54:08] praise the Lord put God first don't let
[1:54:11] their word Define you who your flesh is
[1:54:15] amen don't let their thinking Define
[1:54:18] your spirit realm because your spirit
[1:54:20] will pick it up right then and the devil
[1:54:22] will have a Heyday of it amen and so
[1:54:25] Christ put everything under his feet to
[1:54:27] make you free
[1:54:30] this morning the devil has no legal
[1:54:33] right on you yeah right amen you are
[1:54:36] sitting in the presence of God this
[1:54:38] morning amen you you've heard what the
[1:54:40] word says today among many other times
[1:54:43] with the ministry here amen and the word
[1:54:46] declares you free the word declares you
[1:54:50] healed the word declares you delivered
[1:54:54] from every Spirit everything that would
[1:54:57] hinder you you just have to put yourself
[1:55:00] in position to receive it amen
[1:55:04] oh he he would have gave you something
[1:55:06] better he he would have amen but he gave
[1:55:09] you the word of God Amen
[1:55:13] he is so good amen
[1:55:16] oh please church just look what the word
[1:55:20] says amen and just have that personal
[1:55:23] time with him and say Lord Jesus I've
[1:55:26] had this desire for many years
[1:55:30] and God
[1:55:32] forgive me for doubting God help my
[1:55:36] unbelief
[1:55:37] but I believe
[1:55:39] my children I I see what they're doing
[1:55:43] I look at them with purple hair or big
[1:55:46] nose rings Lord don't let me look at
[1:55:50] that
[1:55:50] let me look at the at the soul the seed
[1:55:54] that's in there that seed is God's Lord
[1:56:00] the doctors may have said that I'm going
[1:56:02] to have this condition all my life
[1:56:04] but the word says that with your stripes
[1:56:08] I am healed
[1:56:12] the word says I'm delivered Lord I don't
[1:56:16] want these uh these the devil wants me
[1:56:19] to have depression the devil wants me to
[1:56:21] have anxiety he wants me to have these
[1:56:24] feelings in my spirit realm and they
[1:56:27] seem so real God but the word says
[1:56:30] they're lying vanities that's right even
[1:56:33] though you can feel them even though you
[1:56:36] can see them even though they are in
[1:56:38] your spirit realm or your flesh they are
[1:56:41] still lives of the devil and you do not
[1:56:44] have to be bound any longer for any of
[1:56:47] those things because you are in Jesus
[1:56:50] Christ the word and he has set you free
[1:56:54] amen and so we don't have to be that way
[1:56:57] and Lord I just pray that each of us
[1:57:00] would encourage one another in the Faith
[1:57:02] Lord God let us let us just encourage
[1:57:05] each other to live the life of Jesus
[1:57:08] Christ to speak what the word of God
[1:57:10] says this morning Lord God all that we
[1:57:13] want is Jesus Christ and in him
[1:57:15] crucified Lord because that's the best
[1:57:18] thing Lord
[1:57:19] hallelujah oh praise the Lord I just
[1:57:23] remember that testimony of that woman
[1:57:25] and brother Brown prayed for her to have
[1:57:27] a child and it was thus saith the Lord
[1:57:28] in 10 years I think the testimony is
[1:57:31] went by she says brother Branham I never
[1:57:33] got that child because I didn't believe
[1:57:36] [Music]
[1:57:38] he said well sister
[1:57:41] your unbelief doesn't hinder the plan of
[1:57:43] God you're gonna you're gonna have it
[1:57:45] anyway
[1:57:47] because it was thus saith the Lord
[1:57:51] what difference is the scripture
[1:57:54] the scriptures thus saith the Lord to us
[1:57:57] today
[1:57:58] you believe it
[1:58:00] and you go forward amen
[1:58:02] that governs your family yourself your
[1:58:05] job your career your school

[1:58:15] the name of Jesus Christ and bind that
[1:58:17] demon upon Him and He will return in the
[1:58:20] name of Jesus Christ because you have
[1:58:23] prayed
[1:58:24] the bride has prayed
[1:58:27] because in Revelation it says the spirit
[1:58:29] and the bride says come
[1:58:31] you have the same voice you are full of
[1:58:34] The Same Spirit you have the same word
[1:58:37] and you should have the same success

[1:59:16] what I have to do strip me down I don't
[1:59:18] care but I just want I want

[1:59:35] have placed yourself in Nampa Lord God
[1:59:39] yes there's other churches in Idaho
[1:59:41] praise God
[1:59:43] and I don't know them
[1:59:45] all I know is here
[1:59:47] but God
[1:59:49] this is where the Fountain of the word
[1:59:51] is coming forth
[1:59:52] [Music]
[1:59:54] and we should appreciate that
[1:59:57] [Music]
[1:59:59] God it says that your servants are
[2:00:01] worthy of double honor
[2:00:04] I believe that Lord
[2:00:07] I just say thank you for the ministry
[2:00:10] that is here Lord God let them always
[2:00:11] stand God let them not be weary and well
[2:00:14] doing Lord may they always cast down any
[2:00:17] attitude that the devil wants them to
[2:00:19] have towards towards being persecuted
[2:00:22] Lord God I pray for that in the name of
[2:00:24] Jesus Christ and God most of all each
[2:00:27] and every person that is here today May
[2:00:29] the Holy Spirit
[2:00:31] reveal yourself and bring yourself to
[2:00:34] life in their life and their soul lord
[2:00:36] God may they begin just to accept the
[2:00:39] words of God and let the word overtake
[2:00:43] them Lord in the name of Jesus Christ
[2:00:45] I pray for that in the name of Jesus
[2:00:48] Amen someone needs to come sing or do
[2:00:51] something
[2:00:52] Hallelujah
[2:00:54] praise the Lord
[2:00:58] [Music]
[2:01:11] you know Saints are just amazing how God
[2:01:14] works
[2:01:15] you know as we were talking about having
[2:01:18] the little harvest party for the weekend
[2:01:19] I just felt led to send that
[2:01:22] to Brother Rich I sent it to others in
[2:01:25] in the Northwest here also to invite him
[2:01:28] that Brother Rich was like hey did you
[2:01:31] mean to send that to us
[2:01:33] that's yes we meant to it brother Rich
[2:01:36] says you know we've been having a little
[2:01:38] stressful time in our family church life
[2:01:40] whatever and we want to get away but I
[2:01:44] say this morning amen God let stress
[2:01:47] fall on the cobb family
[2:01:49] that they would come thinking they were
[2:01:51] coming to Idaho for some relief
[2:01:54] but it really was for us amen and so we
[2:01:59] look at that and realize just how
[2:02:01] incredible the Lord is how that he would
[2:02:06] just allow someone to be moved that they
[2:02:10] would come and preach the word to us and
[2:02:12] it would make such a difference in our
[2:02:15] lives and I have to say today which I'll
[2:02:18] take this up with Brother Rich later but
[2:02:21] um I wished he hadn't stomped on my
[2:02:23] right foot quite so much
[2:02:25] uh but it's good it's good because we as
[2:02:29] the bride of Christ as Believers our
[2:02:33] first and foremost desire is to be right
[2:02:35] amen with the Lord yeah you know the
[2:02:39] devil would like us to just have an
[2:02:41] opinion and we all have one
[2:02:44] but at the end of the day isn't it
[2:02:46] beautiful that we find that God's
[2:02:48] causing our opinion to be his opinion
[2:02:51] our thoughts to be his thoughts our
[2:02:55] desires or his desires and it's
[2:03:00] taking place in such a fashion that is
[2:03:03] not by force right we we can be
[2:03:06] compelled to comply or we can be moved
[2:03:10] by the Holy Ghost to desire and I say
[2:03:14] thank you Lord for the moving of the
[2:03:15] holy spirit that causes us to say Lord I
[2:03:19] want to be like you
[2:03:20] amen I want to I want to live the word I
[2:03:22] want to be the word and how beautiful
[2:03:24] that is and if you don't mind just
[2:03:28] miscommenting a couple things here that
[2:03:30] just struck me
[2:03:32] you know
[2:03:35] as Brother Rich was preaching come to me
[2:03:38] I just read this and I can't for the
[2:03:40] life of me but remember I want to say
[2:03:41] it's the Oddball but I'm kind of nervous
[2:03:43] to say it's actually in the Oddball but
[2:03:45] the prophet of God will paraphrase it he
[2:03:48] says you know where the presence of God
[2:03:50] is
[2:03:51] the Supernatural is present now Church
[2:03:57] do we want to be that cold dead Church
[2:03:59] Brother Rich was talking about or do we
[2:04:01] want to be the supernatural hey man
[2:04:04] let's throw aside every opinion and
[2:04:07] every little thing that we have every
[2:04:09] ISM and let's make this as he was
[2:04:12] preaching today in an atmosphere the God
[2:04:15] would come down and move in we could say
[2:04:17] but I disagree about that well
[2:04:20] Hallelujah are you ever coming back for
[2:04:22] dessert
[2:04:22] [Music]
[2:04:41] I want the word to be preached and when
[2:04:43] it's preached the power of God in us
[2:04:47] moving Our Lives amen not us just saying
[2:04:51] I just read this quote brother but I'm
[2:04:52] saying the people come to church and
[2:04:54] they go home and say oh
[2:04:58] I guess that was good
[2:05:00] [Music]
[2:05:02] I want to go home and say I'm in love
[2:05:07] come down and walk the aisles of our
[2:05:10] church today but not only that he came
[2:05:12] by my Pew amen
[2:05:15] amen amen because God promised
[2:05:18] the supernatural take place I say Church
[2:05:22] let's let the supernatural place in our
[2:05:26] lives in our assembly amen one last
[2:05:29] comment do I can I sorry to preach I'm
[2:05:32] trying to break this habit but sometimes
[2:05:34] things just happen and stirs your heart
[2:05:37] I wrote this down in this fashion Lord
[2:05:39] let us learn the difference between
[2:05:42] God's promise with our name on it
[2:05:45] and Satan's promise with our name on it
[2:05:49] let us learn the difference
[2:05:53] every one of those left Egypt
[2:05:57] under a promise for a Promised Land
[2:06:00] [Music]
[2:06:03] that's right everyone
[2:06:07] will we finish
[2:06:09] or fall
[2:06:11] I say we're finishers
[2:06:14] Hallelujah let's just stand
[2:06:16] amen and just Worship the Lord for a few
[2:06:19] minutes amen you don't have a little
[2:06:21] prayer request saints that I would just
[2:06:23] like to throw out to you we had a family
[2:06:27] uh leave a message on the answering
[2:06:31] machine
[2:06:33] and it's garbled and there's enough
[2:06:35] noise and enough whatever we've tried to
[2:06:38] call the phone number that was
[2:06:39] associated with it with no answer but
[2:06:41] they were
[2:06:42] trying to find the church
[2:06:45] and let's just pray maybe before we
[2:06:49] leave today that God would just anoint
[2:06:50] them to contact us again amen they gave
[2:06:53] us an address but you can't understand
[2:06:55] it but no phone number and the phone
[2:06:57] number doesn't seem to
[2:07:00] be connected
[2:07:00] [Music]
[2:07:02] this desire if God's got someone in this
[2:07:04] Valley
[2:07:05] Brother Rich hit it
[2:07:08] I don't care if Grace Tabernacle ever
