lives for Jesus and what good we do what do we have without you what do we have in our lives in our ministry without you without Christ and how God how can we have you let's see you exactly who you

Jesus to find the strength Lord shall find their strength to face you wrestle that out may you come tonight and show us yourself and your word it's your word it's who you are it's all about you and it's all about us and that's the completion of the whole thing help us to see you tonight in your word we ask thank you for service thank you for the atmosphere have once again kept your word like you always thank you Lord Jesus Christ amen amen thank you the song Sirens thank you musicians amen if you have your Bibles tonight we're going to turn over to I believe we're starting in Revelation Revelation chapter 3. it's good to be in the house of God tonight good to be just good to be here Revelations chapter 3 and we're going to read verse 20 all the way down to chapter 4 verse 1. very familiar portion of scripture but I pray that um we don't glass our eyes don't glass over when we read it but God would bring it fresh that's what I was praying in the office Lord we're going to read quotes we're going to read scriptures that are familiar but may they be fresh like we never heard it before tonight behold I stand at the door and knock if any men hear my voice and open the door I will come into him and will sup with him and he with me now this is Christ meaning has been kicked outside of the church's laodicean Church age and when he says he's knocking on our hearts and he'll sup with us he's going to break bread with us just like he did with those on the road to Emmaus and in doing so just having supper with us he's going to open our eyes to who he is to him that overcometh will like grant us sit with me in my Throne he's coming for the bride who is the overcomer even as I also overcame and him sat down with my father in his throne he that hath an ear let him hear what the spirit saith unto the churches he who was ordained or predestinated after this I looked and behold a door was opened in heaven and the first voice which I heard was as it were of a trumpet talking with me which said come up hither and I will show these the things which must be here after amen so after the closing of the church after the church ages then John is sees the door open which is Christ open because Christ is the door opens to us and God Christ is calling us to come up higher because John's the type of the bride and that is been my focus lately in my study lately God bring me to a higher place not a not nothing not that it would be new or something outside of the book but we're still here so you know what that means we're not high enough so God bring us higher Revelation chapter 10 verse 7. now remember John is a type of the Bride says now Revelations 10 verses 7. but in the days of the voice of the seventh angel when he shall begin to sound the mystery of God should be finished in other words it's not a mystery anymore as yet declared to his servants the prophets and the voice which I heard from Heaven spake unto me again and said go and take a little book we have been called to go and take the book which is open in the hand of the Angel which standeth upon the sea and upon the Earth and I went under the angel and said unto him give me the little book two actions he had to go and he had to ask um and I took the little book Excuse me give me the little book and he sent it to me take it and eat it up and it shall make thy belly bitter but it shall be in thy mouth sweet as honey it wasn't until John made the actions State the steps in the direction that then he was told what to do with the book God tries our faith go take the book and you ask for it then God gives it to you now he says you eat this up eat this up and I took the little book out of the Angel's hand and ate it up and it was in my mouth sweet as honey and as soon as I had eaten it my belly was bitter like last Wednesday talked about facing our humanity and you eat the book suddenly you see you are full of unrighteousness you have to face that you have to face the word of God to change you and it is a it is it is all some also sometimes a hard thing to live hard thing to you know separate from mother and father and all that and he said unto me verse 11 thou must prophesy again before many peoples and Nations and tongues and Kings may the Lord bless the reading of his word you can be seated so my title tonight is the finished cycle and my subtitle can you pull that screen up there Gideon the title screen so by title is the finished cycle and my subtitle is this is it so um brother we're going to read a quote here brother management is the it's it's actually from the church age book resume of the ages brother mentions apostasy and so I wanted to Define apostasy apostasy means the emba the abandonment or renunciation of a religious or political belief the abandonment or renunciation he says in the resume of the ages he says but the age in which each lived was not the age of restoration neither was there any age but this last age the age of complete blackout in apostasy so what are we living in today I mean complete abandonment and renunciation of religion of of of of of Christianity you know down to the ages everybody went to church on Sunday everything closed on Sunday not today whatever it wants to do as much as they can to not be identified with Christianity and you know in dealing in in preparing for this sermon tonight I just I had this this this uh this pricking in the back of my my my heart my mind my heart of inspiration but I didn't know I didn't know what it was yet and uh so I don't know exactly how this is gonna go tonight I don't know which direction this is but my desire is I'm feeling impressed upon to to look at the scripture so look at the quotes to challenge us with the question what are we what are we doing right now because this is it there's no you know in Matthew 11 verse 3 the Disciples of John go to Jesus and say Jesus John has sent us to ask are you the one or do we look for another we're not looking for another this is it you know if you will God has has he had his Workshop beginning of time he began to begin to speak the word to create the world the light there be light all these things come down and and then and then he said in planned Redemption when Adam and Eve fell and he worked on this Plan of Redemption and he brought it down Through the Ages and and you had you know polycarp and Paul and all down Through the Ages and then and then he brought the seventh angel or the messenger for the Branham spoke through him brought the word open the word to us and then now the last thing is is for us to go so if you allow me the Liberty to say this God's sweeping up his Workshop because the whole thing is done that's it this is it we don't have to look for another this is it the brother Adam says in this quote this is the finishing cycle he says the age of the finishing cycle this is where I got my title so let's keep reading this is the age of apostasy and this is the age of restoration it is the age of the finished cycle in other words eternity goes into psych eternity is a is like a circle goes in a cycle but guess what God's fixing to to end it and he's done it he's done it now now this is for me and you it's not done for the Jews but I'm not a Jew are you I'll let God deal with him I want to be tucked away in the palace so this is it so what are we doing we you are standing Before the Throne and the little book is out there waiting for you to take it what are you doing are you looking for another Revival are you looking for another great ministry no this is it this is the finished cycle this is that point in time where we're down through history they were waiting for this yeah yeah they were looking for this you know how like I remember as a kid I built a tree house and when it was done I was like well that's it the fun part was building it right so so we're building it Revival Azusa right the ministry of the brother random all these things happen the sword on the mountain great things happening we're after the other all you had to do is stand there and be like wow you were sucked up into it but now now the word is there laying for you this is it go take the book go get it if it's that simple why are we sitting around not taking the book notice I said we why are we it's right there amen and this is it I'm going to say that a lot tonight so just could deal with it with this it is all over now this is the resume of age this is the end of the church age book he said so we conclude the seven Church ages saying only what the spirit said to each age he that hath an ear let him hear what the spirit saith unto the churches I sincerely believe that the spirit of God has been speaking to us not only teaching us the truth of the ages now I I put I put the closing in here because for me it really it really it really um kind of brought it home when as he wraps of the church the church age book what he says really brought it home that that this is this is it this is the finished cycle I sincerely believe okay that is the reason for all preaching and teaching for it is in the preaching and teaching of the word that the sheep hear the voice of God and follow him not for one moment do I bring do I need to say preaching and teaching of the word do I need to say the other thing is not there we need pastors and preachers and evangelists and apostles not for one woman do I bring a message to the people that they may follow me or join my church or start some fellowship and organization I have never done that and will not do that now I have no interest in those things but I do have an interest in the things of God and people and if I can accomplish this one thing I will be satisfied I believe as a minister and any other ministers our pastor and Brother David this is our desires as ministers that'll be satisfied that one thing is to see established a true spiritual relationship between God and men and man I might print that and put that on my wall that is my burden saints that is my burden and every time I prepare to to minister and and I don't say this to lift myself up but you just you have to come to the reality that I cannot convince you that's right amen I wish I could but I don't wish I could because if I could we know the rest of the story wherein men become New Creations in Christ you know what I love to see I love to see somebody get consecrated and coming Faithfully to church feeding the word faithfully and little by little you see their lives change now we should look in our own back in our own lives and say well I hardly recognize that man four years ago we should do that so look retrospectively that is a you as a youth leader as a minister I'd love to see God and you know what it it it sometimes God will bring us someone a soul in and and boom they're serving God and that might happen What would appear quickly but what I love to say is years go by you come back years later you go wow you were pressing on for God you were growing in the word and I hope that they would see the same in me live according to his word I would invite plea and warn all to hear his voice at this time and yield your lives completely to him even as I trust in my heart that I have given my all to him God bless you and may his coming Rejoice your heart so I already read Matthew 11 3 and said unto him art thou he that should come or do me look for another we're not looking for another I didn't give it to you by the Gideon we're not looking for another we're not this is it this is the finished cycle and thank God for that this is what the sages of the ages have longed for and we have it right there we have it right there God help us not leave it sitting on the nightstand in Jeremiah 33 verse 11. it says the voice of joy and the voice of gladness the voice of the bridegroom and the voice of the Bride you see we read here I'll flip back to it chapter 4 verse 1. um or excuse me no revelation's 10. he said unto me thou must prophesy again before many peoples and Nations and tongues and Kings the bride has eaten the book and she is called to go and speak the book preach the book to to every every for every people's Nations and tongues and kings it's the voice of the Bride the voice of them that shall say praise the Lord opposed you see adoration to God not man brother man he preaches these sermons and I don't know I look at it this way I look at it this way he get he'll he'll be preaching a sermon say for example like The Siege shall not be able to Shook and and it's you got to slow down and you got to take that piece by piece but every time he always brings it back to the one thing feed on the word and for me and myself I always thought man why don't like I need to stop saying that it's too simple but then you feed the word of God and you you eat the book and you and you study to minister you go well that's the whole thing that's what it's all about and you travel and you hear about people and and young people especially a lot of them don't even read their Bibles and I'm not saying that in a judgmental way but I wonder what happened what happened you can't serve God unless you do and I know I'm probably preaching to the choir I hope I'm preaching to the choir I know the youth have heard this because I I labor it to them you cannot do it you say oh I need to overcome so you go to camp and you go to the altar but nothing changes because that is not gonna change you permanently you need the word now you can have an experience and God can set you into your path of victory but you have to maintain that relationship brother Madam says you have to maintain your faith or you'll lose your healing the same thing applies to your spiritual life that's why you know if if if if if you are not careful never mind so praise the Lord of hosts for the Lord is good for his mercy endureth forever me and brother Alex we're talking about that in the office thank you God for your grace thank you for your grace when I see people and I see them just you know for any lost soul I I I have a heart but when you see people go and they just go wham left field hardcore I just I feel so bad for them I don't say you know I I just I because they don't know the truth they're trying to fix a problem with the world's answers and I can't the hard part is I can't go to them and say look now listen up it doesn't do any good that's now what I'm talking about is different than going after your brother and talking to him that's different brother Graham says you should do that so he says the scripture in Jeremiah 3 to 3 11 I'm going to finish this and of them that shall bring the sacrifice of praise unto the house into the house of the Lord for I will cause to return the Captivity of the land as at the first saith the Lord what happened we're in the promised land okay so the the land was under the bondage of organization but then God came and he opened the land to us and now the fruits that come from the land are ours to take we gotta fight for them but they're ours to take the land is free for us to use it was under the bondage of of the the methodists and the amorites but now it's open to us and the fruits are yours unless you fall into idolatry then the fruits become somebody else's they come when they steal your corn and then you've got to do like shamgar and take it back but God gives you the ability for that lasting difference in your life and that fruit you feed on the fruit you see we struggle sometimes to Bear the fruit and leave the land in captivity stop cultivating the garden and deal with the bad guys you're gonna because all you're doing is gonna grow corn for the Philistines shamgar had to stop dealing with the animals stop dealing with the corn and go fight the enemy get the enemy out of your land first then work on the land because you'll work on the land and they'll take the fruit but you get the devil out of your life get the devil out of here now that sounds really really harsh but the devil can be your pride you know it doesn't have to be some great sin it can just be your Humanity your weaknesses your complexes get that dealt with cultivate the land and got the fruits that you that you receive from that will give you greater strength to keep the enemy off your land now uh so the voice of the bridegroom the voice of the Bride yeah Brother David but the wise answered so excuse me Matthew 25 verse 9. so now we're at the the wise and the foolish version let's get back on topic here I got a bunny trailer now we got the we're talking about the the finished cycle and this is it okay Matthew 25 9 we we step into the middle of the story of the wise and the foolish virgin and says but the wise answered they answered the foolish version saying not so get your own oil lest there less because they're asking for oil not so unless there be not enough for us and you but go ye rather to them that sell and buy for yourselves now we are right there we are with the bridegroom in a marriage now we're not raptured yet but we are right here in that Union with God see see I always I totally used to use this and maybe I'm a little bit too much of a nerd but in in geometry you have what's called theorems now it's been a while since I did geometry I just remembered this this part so if I explain it wrong just go look it up and forgive me but if if you have in ethereum if you have a truth for example you know it's geometry so it's different but four plus four equals eight then you know the next thing is true now in studying the word of God it's actually the same way if we are Rebecca and Isaac in the tent we can't be the virgins outside of the house right so you take truths God reveals something to you he gives you revelation of a truth now take that truth as a little Looking Glass and run back through all of the scriptures back through all of the message and because of that little truth things will pop out that you never saw before because you're running that truth back to the word that Revelation so now if we're with Isaac and we have to receive C we're married okay so we're not virgins anymore we're not outside of the house now we're not raptured the foolish virgin are looking for oil they're looking for Oil we're somewhere be in this in this verse right here we're somewhere we're with the bridegroom and we're somewhere in that those verses there that's where we are today because we have to receive the word seed to bring forth the promised son now just so you know I'm not losing my mind and making this up the fire attire and church age when the cry went out behold the bridegroom cometh the five foolish had to run seeking oil while the five wise virgins went into the marriage the five that remained outside were left to the Great Tribulation now the Great Tribulation has not happened yet but they're left outside I'm not going to decide who is who going to preach the word because the foolish are looking for the oil the five that remained outside were left to the Great Tribulation that is what will happen to all who do not go up in the rapture so in in Matthew 22 verse 1. Matthew 22 verse 1. and Jesus answered and speak unto them again by Parables and said the Kingdom of Heaven is like unto a certain King which made a marriage for his son now I appreciate Brother David ministering the other day and and just inspiration the Lord spoke and I never saw this in this way before until that point in time just goes to show you God God working the way he said he would through the Revival Ministry the Kingdom of Heaven is like unto a certain King which made a marriage for his son hmm another this marriage and sent forth his servants to call them that were Biden to the wedding and they would not come again he sent forth other servants saying tell them which are bidden behold I have prepared my dinner my ox and my fatlings are killed and all things already come unto the marriage but they made light of it and went their ways and went to his farm another said look brother why can't you just teach people the gifts another two is merchandise and Remnant took his servants and entreated them spitefully and slew them but when the king heard thereof he was Wrath so so the king turned he gave them a chance he gave the denominations a chance the message was come out of Babylon into the truth he gave them a chance to come to the marriage but they returned it down so God turned and when the king heard thereof he was Wrath and he sent forth his armies and destroyed those murders and burned up their City God left them left the move there outside of the church now he says then he said to his servants the wedding is ready but they which forbidden were not worthy thank you Lord that he saw me worthy how I don't I don't care I don't care how or why I just know because because I'm here today and that makes me happy and go therefore into the highways and as many as you shall find bid to the marriage who who are these people coming up I mean where do they come from you go listen to the to different testimonies of brothers and coming and and me and you coming where I mean where did we come from you know and um and uh okay going therefore to the highways and as many as you shall find bid to the marriage so those servants went out into the highways and gathered together all as many as they found both bad and good and the wedding was furnished with guests and when the king came in to see the guest he saw their man which had not on a wedding garment oh did you hear about that Pastor left the message now I don't know if they're saved or not I'm not saying that's a sign of where we're living you gotta have the wedding Garden what's the wedding garment it's the new birth you got to be clothed in the word of God and God is showing us in the time that we live I'm just using scriptures and quotes to show you tonight where we are right now God is using that to show us look it's got to be the word because now in the time that we are living in it's the marriage and the only thing that's going to keep you there the only one that's going to keep you consecrated to your husband Christ is being clothed in the word clothed in the garments he has purchased for you he purchased those garments for you now we have to call ourselves that's the only thing so today they they they faked it they faked it but then the god the word came and said it's time to divide it's time to divide so don't don't feel bad don't don't count them out you don't know you don't know who's who or what's what don't count them out but use that to show you this is it this is the finished cycle don't look for another Revival there'll be Revival in our hearts right because God's word is opening to us and that makes me excited that's Revival to me but there's no more great sweeping movements to sweep people along because you see as the wheat grew it drug everything with it but then the seed came and now you know this is this now there's a separation all along it was the same thing the life the same thing but then it's separated seed from the plant that is where we are today so this is it why don't we just take the book and get on with it and we are we are but I'm challenging you I'm challenging me God bring me up higher what does that mean what does bring me up higher mean greater knowledge of the word no too many people have the knowledge and then they turn right around and walk away because knowledge doesn't do any good it's Revelation so it's the word that's it written upon the table of your heart and that is what's going to make the difference you know what it fascinates me to look at the history of the message since brother manner passed away the little bit the little that I know of it it was like kids with with something that didn't know what they were doing with wow wow what is this right and then you started to grow up and say ah some people said ah never mind a few years ago 10 years ago 2012. maybe a little bit longer than that people said ah never mind it's not cool anymore it's not exciting it's not new foreign but what was it it wasn't sweeping them along anymore they weren't caught up in it anymore God began to pick the fish from the net that's right say no never mind wow this is the salmon no never mind now we pity them but at the same time we should be excited say wow this is it this is the finished cycle and that should get us excited that should get us not that you have to jump up and shout right now I just mean inspired I don't when I say excited I don't need an outward expression you know I mean inspiration you get up and that's what gets you out of bed in the morning say wow God what what's next do you think Enoch do you think Enoch was just like yeah okay yeah God Bible cool no you're kidding me people were like oh here comes Enoch again we're gonna hear all about it you should be that person that in the conversation you know you just talk about the word and not that you're trying to make a point or be heard but it just spills over that's right just spills over that's Revival that's the bride's Revival what is the bride's Revival it's not Azusa Street it's the word when you see the word why did Brother random run around the tree because he saw himself in the book he saw himself in the word why do I get excited and run around sometimes because I see myself in the book you say you see you'll see your name written over and over again that's right it's written once but you God will show you something in the word say wow there's my name again because the book of redemption is well okay the book religion is with us but it's also with us it's right here you were written on the pages so this marriage is happening and he finds anyone that's not wearing a garment he said saith unto him friend how cameth thou and hither not having a wedding garment and he was speechless then said the kings of the serpents bind him hound and hand and foot and take him away and cast him into outer Darkness there should be weeping and gnashing of teeth there shall be right so he's cast out but the world is the world weeping a gnashing of teeth is that to come there shall be for many are called but few are chosen in other words we needed some of these men to furnish the wedding we needed some of these men to be guests to furnish it some of these women what push the look now I'm just going to be very factual nothing against anyone but look at voice of God they pushed the word out there now they're they're off in left field and we pray for them we don't judge them whatever that's their thing but they God used that as a vehicle to push the word out amen look look at look at what what you know Jeff Jenkins and that church did with brother Lonnie and everything then they God used them to furnish a wedding the word is getting out there then but then there came a time where people all over the world started to raise up and say now hang on a second why is it now we're just now getting these books and stuff interpreted into languages what about all the years we've had and and why why did God allow that to just do what it did I don't know the answer to that question but I do know now this is it they have to know so God said hey God's perfectly on time and anyone who's been around the block a time or two doesn't care who you are or what church you come from they want the word of God so they're ready now these places in these other countries they're ready now for the truth they're tired of the men who fake it and then cause problems they're ready for the truth and that truth is going to bring that separation saints of God this is it this is the finished cycle I want to be walking forward and saying give me the book and then I want to eat it because we got the book you know what why do we why do we have iPads and iPhones and message books and tapes and bibles and bibles and bibles so we have no excuse I I've seen this in in my own life and in the life of others over the past few years God will always have somebody with a testimony so somebody else has no excuse you say why am I walking through this well for one it's gonna build character in your life but the other hand you're an example you walk through the divorce you're an example you walk through your husband walking out and I know this isn't here you're an example parents walk away you still serve the god serve god you're an example sister walks away you still serve the god brother but you're an example you face hardship you face false Doctrine might as well be called a cult you walk out of it you serve God what you're an example nobody has now that's the negative side of it the positive is you is those who have are walking that and you can look at them and say I made it amen you can too or you see them and you pray and say God somehow you brought me through you can do the same thing for them you can do the same thing for them so Revelations chapter 19. verse 6. and I heard as it were the voice of a great multitude and as the voice of many Waters and as the voice of Mighty thundering saying Alleluia for the Lord God omnipotent reigned look at this again adoration first thing God first thing Christ my kids wanted me to tell the story We and do we do devotions uh we we learned uh from from um actually we were we were listening to brother rap crook when I was there in in North Carolina ministering with him and uh he just you know God just showed us hey this is how you do devotions with kids so I tell I either tell a story or they act it out and we acted out and so they were the kids wanted wanted the Ten Commandments last uh last night so um you know I told I I we sat down for that one I told the story and I said I don't know why this is I'm losing my train of thought oh God first so I said they they chose the idol they chose that golden calf and they brought it higher than God and anything in your life that you bring higher than God becomes an idol work housework gotta clean the kitchen did you read your Bible but the Chris we have moved Beyond such simple things then why are we still doing it put you in remembrance of these things look at Paul he had to go back Galatians what are you doing you were Faithfully taught you know Corinthians whoever it was so adoration to God first and foremost let us be glad and rejoice and give honor to him for the marriage of the Lamb is come and his wife hath made herself ready not will it's the finished cycle like I said God swept up his Workshop it's there it's ready all he's got to do is roll up the door and drive it out it's ready the bride's there with him they're ready to take that Chariot to the sky he's finished the work he's wrapped it up now the last thing to do is for us to rapture this is it amen the age of the finished cycle amen there's not another thing coming so that puts the responsibility what I'm trying to say tonight and what what I believe the Lord is trying to say is I put the responsibility in your hands because he's done it it's perfectly prepared for you get up and take the book get up and take the word not take a man don't take me please don't take my word for it you know why I want you to go to the word because the next time I preach you'll be saying amen ahead of me and as a minister The Minister's here I love that when someone's one step ahead you say praise God they're right there why because you know what the word you you take it you hear this tonight then you go and you study the word brother Madam says you know study the word you don't have to be a preacher to study the word of God study the word you know take something take something simple and just say well I wonder you know the power okay look we have technology today we might as might as well use it okay take the Bible app and just search a word something yeah like we're talking about the bridegroom tonight search the Bible for bride room there's a lot of awesome scriptures there don't don't try to be like oh no you know we got to be you know no technology now if it's personal preference I'm not talking about that I'm talking about you try to make it like you know it's it's non-spiritual to use your your computer um I believe we've grown beyond that you know so take the take the Bible app and and look up a word and see it through the scriptures and when you do that one jumps to the next and then to the next and guess what at that point in time you are feeding say my ass grass is good you ever see your horse gray say move their way around right the grass the good grass leads to more good grass the good word leads to more good word and then you come to church and the preacher preaches what you read why you're eating the book we lack because we don't we lack we want Victory we you know and we we focus on that thing and I'm gonna tear that down and and we leave the word over here don't worry about the Philistines that's feed on God next thing you know you come to yourself killing a hundred by yourself hey you pulled this sermon this direction so he says let us be glad and rejoice and give honor to him for the marriage of the Lamb is come and his wife hath made herself ready and to her was granted that she should be arrayed in Finland and clean and white for the fine linen is the righteousness of saints oh God Amen and he saith unto me right blessed are they which are called unto the marriage supper of the Lamb see if we're going to a marriage supper but that's like that's like uh the reception but we're married but it's it's different than the reception because we received the seed so but there's a marriage supper coming a celebration of the marriage but we are we are one with him that's not my words go search it through the message one with him or the two are one the thing of it is saints of God everything we get in the Bible surrounds marriage now I'm gonna say something that might sound a little bit crazy but just chew on it you don't need the Bible in heaven that's right so if it's written here you need it here don't look for it to come like I said this is it don't look for it to come it's yours for the taking don't think something more has to happen for you to get more of the word it's ready for you all you have to do is say God let me eat the book God I'm hungry let me eat the book show me the next Port show me where to take the next bite don't sit around waiting for something else to happen don't sit around waiting for another Dynamic service don't sit around waiting for Family Camp in June get the book now and then you'll enjoy Family Camp in June a whole lot better because when you put off getting what God's given to you you will live in misery but when you say God let me take it and it will be bitter in your belly it'll be better on your belly but at that point it's already in you and you can't help it a woman get oh a woman says I want to have a baby come on let's have another baby okay all right what happened to the baby and she gets pregnant in the morning see it's better but there's nothing she can do about it it's happened it's there it's coming right the pain and birth she doesn't like it but there's nothing she can do about it you eat the book it's sweet as honey right so you'll keep going for more and then it gets inside of you well it's inside of you it's going to live itself through you whether you want it to or not and we wanted to but sometimes it's hard you think about a grass you know just it grows through everything pushes through concrete what is it pushing for the light it's pushing for light what is that child growing inside of a woman's womb it's pushing for the light it wants out can it go out at three weeks can they go out at 25 weeks it's got to be full term the word inside of somebody you'll look at them and you say what's their problem it's probably not full term the word of God comes to each one in different points and we talked about turning the corner each person has to come along to their point in time all we can do as mature Christians I'm claiming that you may think oh mother Chris is the farthest thing for a mature Christian I'm going to claim it you look and you say oh that's okay I'll pray for them you don't look at I don't look at my daughter Elaine and say my goodness why can't you figure out how to drive a car no say well one day mom will teach you how to drive a car it's the stage's life yeah don't excuse that in the Christian Life there's stages of life that she have to walk through and each person comes to God give us the grace give us Grace there's a song I think the Cochran family sings it he giveth more grace that's all I remember he giveth more grace and all we have to do is eat the book he said man God I really want to be more empathetic and more compassionate to your people don't go read Dr Dobson go read the Bible go eat the book now you might find good things sometimes in that stuff simple things but go go eat the book and you'll become more like God and in doing so he'll say wow have you noticed the difference in Sister Julia sorry you're just right there have you noticed the difference in Brother David right you try to okay I think I labored it enough and I fell at his feet he says unto me these are the true sayings of God man there's some scriptures in the Bible where it's just like it's like the condensed uh concentrated yeah and it you know takes one sermon per verse 10 and I fell out his feet to worship him and he said unto me seed thou do it not I am thy fellow servant and of thy Brethren that have the testimony of Jesus I put this in here because he says worship God for the testimony of Jesus is the spirit of Prophecy in other words in other words the Tet what's the testimony of Jesus the word and that is the spirit of prophet does it line up with the word oh of a prophecy came does it line up with the word if an angel come and preach anything other we just heard this from Brother George anything other than what is written here I don't care because right here is truth and if we're not careful we we read that scripture and we talk about that we say yeah it's easy it's not easy unless you're consecrated you got to be consecrated to God you got to be the further that we go along I believe the less of the world we will partake of amen now there are certain things we have to do that's part of this life but saying the less what what is the big thing in the world today everywhere you go what is it entertainment what is entertainment distraction distraction that's why we got people who are 425 pounds they're distracted from being healthy that's a kind of a crude example but it's the truth you're distracted from the word of God you're gonna get fat on the world well actually if you're a Christian you're going to starve to death this all entertainment is distraction now there's some good entertainment in balance about I speak these things from personal experience say man why am I grumpy oh I'm out of balance too much of this entertainment now I'm not talking about movies with curse words clean entertainment we should be mature enough to know to know that now and I've been guilty of that too now proving his word 1964. now remember that was not Jesus talking to Abraham there that could discern the thoughts in Sarah's mind and wrapping this up behind him that was not Jesus he had not yet been born but it was a man in human flesh that Abraham called Elohim the great Almighty showing and Jesus said it as it was in the days of Sodom now watch close in the days of Sodom so will it be in the coming of the son of man when the son of man is being revealed not no more as a church see not no more the bride is called amen what happened in Matthew was it Matthew 20 22 25 what happened in Matthew 25 the bridegroom called okay so the bride has been called in that day the son of man will be revealed to join the church to the Head unite you see why there's so many problems in churches who don't believe the open Word how can you overcome the world without Christ the marriage of the Bride the bridegroom call will come right through this when the son of man will come down and come in human flesh to unite the two together okay the church has to be watched now the church has to be the word he is the word and the two unites together God isn't into whoredom so the only way the two can unite together is by a consecrated marriage and to do that it'll take the manifestation of the revealing of the son of man not a clergyman do you see what I mean see it's the son of man Jesus Christ will come down in the human flesh Among Us and will make his word so real that it'll unite the church and him as one the bride and then shall go home to the wedding supper she's already United praise God that gets me excited she's already United see we go to the wedding supper not to the marriage okay say what he said all the tapes after the seals if you're that kind of person amen excuse me I lost my spot wedding supper and she's already United okay of all the Flesh of Mighty Men calls the marriage of lamb has come but the Rapture is going to the wedding supper when the word here unites with the person and they too become one and then what does it do then ready you ready for this yes it manifests the son of man again not the church theologians it manifests the son of man again in other words you manifest amen amen bust on the man he said brother Chris we know this stuff good you're with me the son of man the word and the church becomes one whatever the son of man done he was the word the church ready the church say with me the church does the same thing a book of Acts you see you in the message today we have two sides we got the legalistic side and we got the overly Pentecostal side but you listen to both sides because you can you can do that you can listen to both sides and you say wow yeah yeah yeah and then you listen yeah yeah yeah why because they both have truth the church does the same thing in other words there should be Expressions there should be moving of the Holy Spirit don't hold the Holy Spirit back don't hold him back let him go let him Express himself through you that's the problem when you when you try to work it up you're on the far side when you hold it back as you gotta sit and yeah then you're on that side brothers and sisters please I you know what the God just the Holy Spirit just came on my heart and such a burden Monday I was Monday evening the family was away running errands and I had to work still I was making myself some dinner I just stopped and I'd say God Wednesday night liberate your people people I don't want us to hold back the moving of the Holy Spirit I don't want us to work it up either but if we're not careful we preach too hard on one side we preach so hard on the other but God liberate your people however that would be because guess what we all go through seasons of dryness we need the rain the teaching rain to come and wet a soil of Our Lives again the church does the same thing now in this in the in in closing here this day that scripture is fulfilled go that's your homework go listen to that tape he read the scripture and both of them is excited this is the closing of the sermon he's excited he says he read the scripture handed the Bible back to the priest and said all the eyes of the people were fastened upon him and he looked upon them and said this day this scripture is fulfilled brother Branham would get so excited and so inspired but he could never say it exactly what it is because nobody can nobody can say it exactly what it is but she's study and you pray and you begin to see wow God's saying something this day because he just keeps saying this day this scripture is fulfilled what is he saying this is it this is the finished cycle this day this scripture is fulfilled he said I've read the scripture with a dozen or more evidences that were living in the last day the generation that will see Jesus Christ return to the Earth have you seen him how is it put the Advent have you seen Jesus because he's here I say to you tonight again this day this scripture is fulfilled in your sight I read I think it was this morning I read ODS our daily strength and it was Open the Eyes this day the scripture is fulfilled in your sight God what did he do when he Mount Transfiguration and with with just Peter and a couple of them but when he said this day this scripture is revealing your sight he did it in the open he did it in the public said this day the same thing in the ministry came down this is it come to the marriage supper but only the chosen Only The Chosen catch it let the spirit what let him who the hath an ear to hear what the spirit saith unto the churches God anoint my ear anoint my ear because it gets a little clogged sometimes with the world anoint that Lord it gets a little clogged after a long day of work but God come and anoint my hearing God break away break away because you go to work or you you get online nowadays and you gotta deal with the trash listen man it just keeps coming back to this listen the trash accumulates no matter how Sanctified and Holy Ghost filled you are so you have to take a bath so what happens let me ask you this in the carnal what happens if you go a few days without taking a shower you stink your attitude stinks if you go a few days without taking a spiritual bath you wonder what your problem is your wife says what's your problem you say wife what's your problem you didn't take a bath yet and people wonder why they can't overcome they stink they're dirty take a bath if you take anything from that tonight take a bath take a spiritual bath the scripture is fulfilled in your side you in Tucson you in California you in New York you and I Nampa Idaho on these telephone hookups this day this scripture is fulfilled in your sight 1965 February what is he saying that was the last year of his ministry this is it this is the finished cycle this is it let us be glad and make Merry for the marriage of the Lamb is at hand and his bride has been past tense has made herself ready saints of God you want to come that's where we are today these scriptures these quotes familiar to us but just a gentle reminder from God this is it this is the finished cycle the responsibility is in your hands there is no more word now I say this in the broad terms there's no more word to be revealed it's all ready for you there's no more let me say it this way there's no more Mysteries to be unlocked there's more to be revealed to you but it's there and ready all you have to do is go take the book every day you got to go take the book every day you got to go before the throne and take the book you can't just go and pick up the Bible and read a few pages like it's a newspaper you got to go before the throne in other words what when you go before the throne what are you doing you are standing in the presence of the king it's a spiritual relationship and when I say I want to I want to see me I want to see you liberated [Music] can I be a little bit blunt Sunday we are having service and I felt that atmosphere just about to crack open now God's Sovereign and he has his way and I'm not trying to ask us to work something up but let's stop being starchy let's let God Express himself let's not hold him back because we have a schedule oh we got work in the morning what if work's not there for you tomorrow what if this is it you don't know what what is the most important thing in your life is it your job or is it God now if you put God first you will give your job 110 percent you will do the best that you can but what is the most important thing are you are you binding up the holy spirit in your life because you're on a schedule are you binding up the moving the spirit of God in the church because well it's two songs after the preaching and then we close the saints of God this is it why not take it why not take it figuratively speaking they take it by the horns in other words take it all grab it as much as you can eat it the angel of the Lord never said not careful eat it slow he just said eat the book you see what happens Saints is it's not when we say don't read the Bible it's a newspaper you've got to like I said be in the presence of the king we have to create that atmosphere now right now there's an atmosphere [Music] I say oh well it's a workout because sister because playing the piano no it's not the words been spoken God uses music God uses the atmosphere
