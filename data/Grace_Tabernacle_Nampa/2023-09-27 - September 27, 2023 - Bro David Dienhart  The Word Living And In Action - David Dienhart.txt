of light because in him the message God is the message this message God is is light yes amen amen this is the message we received him him God is light amen and children of light then we are part of God we're walking in him walking in the light declaring the light see the Holy Spirit won't be ashamed to declare the message because the message is himself that's right and if he's in you it makes you a part of himself and so you're the message made manifest so we're thankful for this and grateful for the word of the Lord and God's wanting us to walk in the light amen stand with me this evening thank you to the vaa and Alex thank you God bless you amen it's good to have everyone here it's a Wednesday and uh we wish everyone would be here but but those that have come out wanted to so we're just glad for your being here we greet those on the internet and I don't know who all is lifening in I know few of them may be but God knows what they have need of and so we just welcome each one let's bow our heads in his presence as we bow before him our father How Great Thou Art you're the dissolver of all doubts you're the one that reveals the word and if we get excited and anxious we need to just take it to prayer and learn to wait on you for you're never wrong you're always right Lord you never fail and Lord if we ask anything in your name if we're walking in the light then we know we have confidence that you hear us and if you hear us then we know we have our petition so Lord if there's anything in our lives that's not right may you take it from us right now because we are hearing from The King The King of Kings we're hearing your voice and Lord we're expected to leave here and raised to a higher place and when we came in that's our desire it don't matter how many's here we're not looking at numbers it's not numbers where two or three are gathered together you said in my name that's a birthed word in my name there am I in the midst of them that's all we need to know all is well Lord we look to you you are a confidence you are our strength and we are totally dependent upon you not upon this man outer man man not upon what it is its feelings its reasoning its ups its Downs that's not who identifies us Lord we are identified in Christ the word and Lord teach us continue to teach us to rely upon you to walk in the light and live out what we are than you Lord and For Your Glory we ask your blessing upon the word individually personally yes Lord in Jesus Christ's name we pray amen amen if you'll turn with me and in your Bibles to Philippians chapter 2 I want to read verse five first here as we start my title tonight is the word living and in action the Bible bride you want to know what the Bible bride is she's the word God's thought expressed she's the word living and in action amen amen now that's a that's a great lesson and probably this probably will be part one I don't know I just have a question mark by it but possibly if we have the opportunity to come back as there's a lot more to this that I'd like to express and it's what God's mystery is in Christ we're just starting with this God has a mystery in Christ well I thought Christ was the mystery of God revealed that's right but there's another mystery in that mystery so I'll just let you chew on that a while maybe we'll pick up on it further we'll begin to hold it bring it in here tonight as the Lord allow us the time so verse five let this mind be in you which was also in Christ Jesus who being in the form of God thought it not robbery to be equal with God but he made himself of no reputation it took upon him the form of a servant was made in the likeness of men and being found in fashion as a man he humbled himself notice and became obedient unto death even the death of the Cross daily that should be our our walk we should take up our cross and follow him death to self Paul said I Die daily yes amen amen it's not my free thought about anything it's what he said and we have a message today which is the perfect interpretation of the word by Divine Vindication therefore that which is in part is done away because we have the perfect that's not my word that's a prophet's word you want to hear it he said this is verbatim I say verbatim but we read between the lines don't we because who's he speaking about we do have today by God's help the perfect interpretation of the word with Divine Vindication then that which is in part is done away with amen amen amen we have a word to make a Rapture in fact the Rapture is already begun but we have a word to change our bodies and it's working in US yes amen amen so we read that now verse 13 for it is God which worketh in you both to Will and to do of his good pleasure let's just read some more do all all things without murmurings and oh this is the good one disputings you know what causes contention I don't know how God's going to bring this and I'm just going to say what he puts in my heart to my mouth to say is that all right with you yes sir what causes contention is pride one element Pride causes contention instead of contention why not pray amen all right for it is God I want you to make this very definite for it is God which worketh in you yes I'm talking to bride I'm talking to seed tonight this which is God it is God which worketh in you both to Will and to do of his good pleasure now he's expecting some of something from us amen because it's himself working yes see Satan's quick to bring disruption and distractions and all these other things but I want you he wants you to realize tonight where your place is and what you're called to do we are actually called in this hour to bear his name the only way we could bear his name is be pregnated with with his life right amen so that takes the union now that's our day that's our hour we're in a maturing age time I should say we are in a maturing time which is called the bride age it's not another church age it's the it's the manifestation of the mystery revealed through those Church ages is now made manifest in the day and hour that God intended it to be because now the seal is opened and I'm just going to tell you the seventh seal is open amen amen and you're unveiled he's unveiled when he's unveiled you're unveiled and that's the secret the bride knows so now he's expecting something he's expecting you to live it why by realizing your position all right I'm getting to preach and I'm not having you seated so let me just go on that ye may be blamed do all things things without murmurings murmurings murmuring murmuring disputings that you may be blameless and harmless the sons of God you know you'd think after a while maturing in this word if you're maturing you would begin to realize you're murmuring you may be disputing when you don't need to dispute there's nothing to be discouraged about there's nothing to be disputing about just take it to God you know what brother Brown said if your wife doesn't isn't really good you kind of acting up or you other du to her what he ask you to do us to do Place God that's right place God how many heard him say that place God just put God before you put God in the in the matter Place God y I've done that Brother David then have faith to wait Place God and let him take care of it position it manif pray about it put it together pray together put Place God Place God in the situation let the peace of God umpire rule your heart amen that you may be blameless and harmless as sons of God without rebuking the midst of a crooked and perverse Nation among whom you individual you shine as lights in the world bride you shine as lights in the world the world there is Cosmos mankind holding forth the word of life amen holding what your argument your dispute no holding forth what word what do you put it under who's the head here Pride or Christ see holding forth the word of life that I may rejoice in the day of Christ that I have not run in vain neither labored in vain and brother sister whatever you ask if you really are a Believer you believe that what you ask for you believe you receive it you're going to get it but it's going to be in God's time and not ours you may be seated amen so the word living in an action what is the word the seed Jesus Christ the word living and in action now that word had to come from somewhere and it came from his thought and his thought was substance what he had in his mind he expressed in a word and it become manifest in creation amen that's the mystery of how God became from word then to become flesh all right he's interested now he's in you so he that is in you is interested in you yes all right all right he's interested in me and he's interested to see his word made manifest that's what he's interested in are we willing to meet his needs are we wanting and willing every day say Lord let me meet your need as a wife she she labors to meet the husband's need hello that's what she does in fact when she gets married she just submits all herself to him everything she has and yields herself to one man I've got a quote on that if you'd like to have it but what that's what we do he's our head we surrendered ourselves we gave up our own thing our own thoughts our own ideas our own things and gave it completely to him yes that's what our vow was amen I'm giving over to you and the wife's position is submission the husband's position is love sacrificial love I don't know why I'm saying all this but anyway I just I just I said I'm going to say what he allows me to say he knows what we need he knows what I need and he's going to meet my need every day that's my expectation all right because I can't meet my need every day he meets my need every day so he's interested in me he's interested to see his word made manifest I'm put emphasize on that he's interested in seeing his word made manifest and he's depending look what he's depending on he's depending on us to do it then we ought to be growing up to realize what he's depended upon what is he dependent upon he's dependent upon himself in you and you've got to recognize this is who you are that it isn't going to say well Lord is this your will you have his will you have his will right here in the word and he reveals it to you and you speak it whose word is it if you speak it in his name it's not David praying it's not me praying it's him praying or I shouldn't be speaking it in his name if I do that outside of that I'm just using his name in vain if I won't believe what I ask for and have confidence in his word I shouldn't be asking it because I'm taking his name in vain if I do that that's kind of striking isn't it see it's not just a play thing to name the name has a meaning the name and everything that goes with it I'm here to bear I'm his wife my wife is here to Bear my life it's a witness of me yes before the people I'm a witness of my husband that's what she is I'm a witness of Christ what am I I'm his word I'm Witnesses of his word all right so see so he's depending on us to do it for we are his agents wife see maybe better word than agents but that's what the prophet used we are his agents nothing in ourselves you can't relying upon a thing in yourself well I don't feel like it nonsense what is feeling got to give forth the sacrifice of praise sacrifice of praise whether you feel like it or you don't right giv him thanks anyway you're not basing your your your life upon how you feel and don't feel any given time that's not the inside man that's the outer man that's a temporal man that comes and that goes and I can't you can't base anything upon that you don't have confidence in that you have confidence in him that is in you amen that's right then we should take every circumstance and how's every circumstance controlled how's every circumstance mastered by this faith that he is in you unveiled yes amen you control it by that Faith amen what do that Faith rest in the word the faith takes this resting place God's faith will take his resting place in his word that never-failing Eternal Word Faith rests in that all right so he's he's he said nothing in ourselves it's him yielding ourselves and walking with him he's depending on us to work through us this is just this has just struck me put such a different mental at just in the last few days it put such a different attitude in fact it was it was Monday I was up I was up up in the woods and just meditating on something and that just come over me in such a reality that God it's in my mouth I have your mind how am I to act what manner of person I ought to be in living here yes right not something we're trying to make oursel different but we are different because we're the Lamb's wife we're going to be different we're going to be a special people and the prophet said we are special people we are people that are able to receive and hear the word for the season nobody else can do that but the bride no wonder the devil's fighting at you and fighting at families and fighting these other things why because he's fighting the word when you submit yourself to the word all is well if you'll give yourself to the word God will take care of the rest of it that's your Firm Foundation the revealed word hallelujah you said but I can't do that no isn't that wonderful you can't but he can and he wants you just to Simply surrender you got to surrender to one of two Spirits you're either going to surrender to the devil's Spirit his power or you're going to surrender to God's power now that faces every one of us right here tonight which one are you surrendering yourself to all right and what's it going to take to surrender to the word it's going to take a death of yourself but how many's willing to die yeah how many's willing to find favor with him and not the people you're working around or people that see you or the people that think about you what is that to you that's temporal they're all going to pass away but there's one thing that can't pass away my word shall never pass away what a consolation what an absolute what an amen my word heavens and earth will pass away including your Earth you're dwelling in yes it's going to pass away but my words shall never pass away and my words include all that's in him and all that he is we are if he's the word what are we all right so see so without us then he's depending on us he's depending on us yielding ourselves and walking with him he's depending on us to work through us oh if you could just chew on that a while he's depending on on us to work through us now if we know what God needs and what he's Desiring then he's depending on us to work through us let us lay down ourselves to meet his need what is the bride here to do on this Earth to manifest him what's her position to manifest the word for the season by how what Revelation so we call upon God for Revelation more than anything else amen yes sir you see yes show me your your way show me how to do this show me what I'm to be show me and show my my fellow brother or my sister or my wife or my husband show them yes how to do this in your time you work everything I'll tell you you do it that way and you trust his word you watch things will begin to move all around and everything will come into its position amen i' I'd say this is this a step on that old anxious spirit that old spirit of fear that things are not going to work like they ought to oh they will work like they ought to if you'll just surrender yourself to the word they'll work right on time as they ought to because who's your head is he perfect or imperfect does he doeth all things well he's perfect than all he does and he said if you'll trust me and rest in me and depend on me then I'll make not he didn't say that I'm saying that but he said he makes our way then perfect if he's perfect and we in him AR isn't our way then Perfect Right sure is then all is well amen I don't care how you're feeling all is well okay praise the Lord all right but they're depending on us see he's depending on us to work through us and without us then they Old and New Testament amen there can be no Rapture no Resurrection without us do you realize the severity I should if that's the right word the the certainty the the the the the meaning of what we're speaking of tonight yeah he's depending on us who's he depending on is he depending on David to figure it out is he depending on David to study it so much that I get an intellectual concep no he's depending on himself in me he's unveiled in me he's depending on himself and that himself he's trying to get across to us is you he wants you to have confidence in what he made you to be and speak then go forward know you not that the word of faith is in your mouth amen if he's dwelling in your heart the word of faith is in your mouth see what is Faith Revelation what are we dependent upon him to reveal his will to us what are we to do he's depending on us to carry it out he has a channel to work through he's got a flesh Veil to work in amen is that right he's got a many membered body which is the seed himself so he's the word living and in action that's the Bible bride other words that's the bride that's the what that's the bride the Bible speaks of is alive and well today amen we've had a message that's unveiled the seal taken the seal off our life taken the veil off of our soul and we can come now and realize the real gift you that know what I'm talking about I'm going to come to it in just a minute all right so if I could let me get through this holding forth the word of life that I'm rejoice in the day of Christ and this is the day of Christ that I have not run in vain neither have I labored in vain you see how can you say it's the day of Christ because this is his time this is his day of secret catching away he's come to claim his people he's here in his people he's taking us out of here we're marching and step with the word if you notice those marching marching had their eye on that messenger and when they got their eye off of the messenger off of his message off of the messenger because the word came to his Prophet it wasn't the man we're worshiping that's not what that that Vision showed it showed that they were watching the word because they knew they had the perfect interpretation that this message was a perfect interpretation that would take them into the Rapture because the seals have been open the book is finished and there's names in that book that would be the complete revelation of the whole thing amen amen hallelujah all right so see we then see that we have the mind of God we have the word of God we have his thoughts that's hid in the word and those thoughts have been unsealed where in Meen that white stone that had no writing on it was Revelations 10 the mystery of those seven Thunders that was the secret but he said now I had to go west to meet that word that to get the interpretation of that and I brought it back to the people and to you and who's this book open to he said to the bride not to him to you amen that's right okay we ought to be eating the open book don't you think amen because he's depending now he said they're depending on us back behind us depending on us for God promised he would have it and somebody's going to be there all right we are enshrouded I love that word enshrouded by the presence of Jesus Christ we are in shrouded by the presence of Jesus Christ do we realize that I can talk to those that are born again and they say yes sir I re believe that I receive that Amen brother sister you say well I don't know Brother David if I am or not then you get on your knees and you pray and say God show me because the new birth is a revelation and it's not unknown it's known yes and it's not an emotion it is the opening of the word that's right amen and that I'm not say that may bring emotion I don't know what that may bring but that's emotions not your evidence the evidence is having the ability to receive or to hear by Revelation the The Word of Promise for the season and if it's a true Revelation it's Vindicated by the word and it'll live itself you don't have to pump it up Work It Up Make It Happen am it's receiving it amen hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah I'm not talking just out of my mouth I'm talking by experience I know this is right amen we are enshrouded by the presence of Jesus Christ depending on us to honor what he has done Among Us by having Fai yes in his word amen whose faith is that in the word there's only one Faith you find in the word his own yes amen amen and those th that Faith was in him amen living and in existence substance that was you that's still you only now you're manifest in a body of clay in your season now it brings us point to point face to face here now who's he depending on he's depending on his word for the season yes which is what what's the season seed time back to himself again only this time in another form yeah who thought it not robbery being in the form of God thought it not robbery to be equal with God Amen all right so he said now watch what else he says he's see he's waiting he's waiting on us to live who we are to focus on the Eternal not the temporal he's waiting on us to go into action ask and shall receive speak and go forward stand upon my word live or die feelings or no feelings senses or no senses you're not depending on that it's my word open to you now you know who you are start living that person I just wish I could get it across I I well well I shouldn't say that because I know God will but it just seemed like that words aren't adequate you see what I'm trying to say but they are adequate because God hides in that but he reveals himself you see how God's kept it away from the wise and prudent by revealing it to to you and I yes you can't manufacture that you can't pump that up it's God reveals it amen and lot most of the time when you least expect it that's the truth he's not based on well if I do if I do this just right he'll reveal it that has nothing to do with well I made mistakes today not going to do anymore that doesn't have a thing to do with whether he reveals the word to you or not it's that you recognize your position and grow in that position and mature in that position growing up why how are you growing up because you are laying in the Rising Sun in the sun well frankly the Sun is up so you're laying in the the presence of the son by Union you're laying in his presence we're talking about a union a marriage Union you're laying in the presence of the Sun and all the greenness is being baked out of you and you're coming to realize oh why am I here to bear his name everything that goes with that name all power all authority all the glory all the honor all the kingship everything all the royalty I'm here to bear that name I don't have to work it up I just have to pray stay in communion with him go on and eat and let him reveal himself and act upon the Revelation amen it isn't you manufacturing anything it's not you doing anything so he comes along and show you it's not right what do you do about it shows you what you did wasn't the way to to handle this and what are you going to do about it he puts light on the light doth make manifest now you have a choice you're either going to accept what he does or disagree with what he does not accept it when he shows you what to do what are you doing that word is inside of you opened up will'll say Amen to that word yes Lord that is right you are right I aired I didn't mean to Heir God forgive me I place the blood over it because the blood token is in me a identifying I've come through that blood then the blood is my strength the blood is my power and I can apply the token in this matter under this air these things I did wasn't me it was the enemy which was closer to me than you realize this is who the enemy is the greatest enemy but he's defeated yes praise the Lord hallelujah hallelujah that's right so we can walk in rejoicing and in peace and you're going to go through trials you're going to make mistakes you're going to go through that are going to teach you and teach you and teach you and you're going to come and grow in maturity and when it's where it needs to be the finished work of that bride was hit sent here as a finished complete work a revelation then he's going to take you out of here and we're very close to that because the bride's going to leave before that covenant's made between Rome and the Jews that money Covenant brother brandom said she will not have to go through that that period that you can't buy or sell yeah first seal he said thank God he'll keep her out of that because he takes her that bride out of here before that covenant's made that traps the Jews in the golden money I I don't have time to go into all that tonight I'm just saying that because we are very close the bride is in her matured State I believe believe that with all my heart and but it's not going to leave one behind we mature at different rates but the Word of Life still needs to be preached I still have need of Christ I want more of him and I want more of him until I see this body Changed by him and I will continue to need more of him and I am so hungry for more of him and he reveals himself so much I can't keep up with it anymore you remember brother brandom at the end of his Ser his ministry he said those things are happening so fast the Revelation I can't keep up with it I thought my I wondered about that I understand now right you can't hardly keep up with it he's opening it so purely and so perfectly and so personally to you and me and now he's saying I'm depending on you what I put in you I'm depending on this is who you are why don't you just go and live who you are well I I'll make I'll make I'll make them mad at me if I do that they're going to hate you anyway you know what the prophet said about preachers he said if you preach this word and preach what God put in your heart to preach today the people will hate you not everybody the bride will love it but he's talking about the majority that carnal believer that still claims to believe the message and he'll claim it until the day of his death a carnal and I'm saying I'm not declaring whether he's saved or lost but to be a carnal believer carnal interpretation is not going to put you in the Rapture it's going to take the absolute working of God in you alone and that comes through a new birth but you after your birth you have to will lay in the presence of the son and ripen into what he intended for you to be himself revealed that's his intent that's what he called you to do now I'm not getting to what I wanted but I'm going to let the Lord take his have his way Hebrews chapter 4 if you go with me over there just a moment I'll read that first then I have and this is very very familiar remember they didn't enter in because of lack of faith I could read all that to you but you can read chapter four then we have a rest that we enter into where we've ceased from our labors as God did from his he rested depending on his children to take what was he depending on then he depended on his children to take care of the earth he rested but now we enter inter rest allow him to take care of us but he's still depending on us to carry out his will but we can't do it in our own humanness wonderful I'm glad I can't I'd be so flustrated if I thought I could I'd be making so many mistakes I'd finally give up and say I can't do it and I can't but he has put his spirit in me and said I will unconditionally said I have I will already finished it all right so now you go back here to Hebrews chapter 4 and ver2 for the word of God this is what we're talking about tonight the word of God that's who you are isn't it wonderful to know that Christ is revealed in his own word yes amen who's his own word you you're the book you're the book within the book while I'm saying that just a moment here that wheat plant was the record of the book of life but in that book of life is a section in the wheat plant there's some that are saved some that are lost in the wheat plant what is the wheat plant for to carry the life has a way for the life to come through back to seed again one seed planted comes into many seeds of the same Source same nature is that right amen all right so the that's why I say the bride of Christ the body of Christ the bride the body is the complete or revelation of himself that's what the prophet said the Bride is a revelation of himself all right so then it comes back to that then then we have well you say if my name's on the book of life isn't that good enough yes and no it depends what section of the Book of Life life your name's in that's right is that right yes it is that's absolutely right I've just went through it two two sermons ago all right then it comes up there but in that book there's a book within a book yeah there's a record within a record the bride record is different than just you say the Lamb's Book and the Book of Life the same book it is but the prophet said her name is in a section and that record is eternal life record is eternal life section and the Holy Spirit bearing record of the word in you bearing record with your spirit identifies you in the record of eternal life for he that hath the son hath life and this is the record that he's given us eternal life that's 1 John 510- 12 yes the record that he's given to us the bride is eternal life and he that hath the son and he that hath the son hath this life and he that hath not the son doesn't have that life right how can you have the son by a word birth right okay so in the be so the word of God is quick and powerful and sharper why because the word in you is Spirit yes amen you just entered into rest so where's the word it's in you it's quick and Powerful amen all right and that quick and Powerful I read this for this purpose that quick and Powerful the Greek meaning is living and operative living and operative living and in action so so the word of God is quick and powerful and sharper than any two-edged sword Watch what it pierces piercing even to the dividing a suer and God help us to get through this part of it dividing a Sund of what soul the real gift yes and spirit little s and the two can be so close together under the same anointing that would deceive the elect if possible but we've had a message the soul has been opened the veil's been removed we see the real gift and that real gift is the faith of God that moves in you amen yes amen because the because because what does the Holy Ghost baptism is for to Quicken that seed germ in your soul yes and when that's quickened is Christ in you which makes you the complete revelation of himself amen you talk about a position brother brandom said greatest battle ever fought he said God's waiting for his his stars to get their position his sons amen what's the Earth waiting on for us to get our position what's what's waiting on the manifestation of the sons of God it's in labor pains for that actually I've heard it preached the other way too they're rejoicing over the fact that sons of God are being manifest amen because they're rejoicing and jumping and and all this volcanic and earthquakes everything is jumping and and rejoicing that sons of God are coming to manifestation they're looking for a restoration they're looking for the manifestation of sons of God yes Hallelujah and here they are become what makes you a son the word is unveiled in you and made flesh that becomes son but the words unveiled in you is the Eternal and you're bringing forth an eternal son in you not out here this isn't this sun isn't Eternal right it will change to Eternal by the word living in me yes but I had a beginning and I have an end but because the word's in me makes me the son amen hallelujah do you understand all right that's how Jesus Christ was son he was God's the son yes cuz God was in him yes and his dependency was God in him what is our dependency he's depending on us what are we depending on oh my now we have a union now what's going to stop it what's going to hinder you what's going to stop her from manifesting what's going to stop her from walking into a Rapture can this upset and this downset and this upset and this downset no none of it all right you're not birth I have all these scriptures I'm going to bypass some of these but now but look at he dividing piercing even to the dividing aund of who you are and who you're not amen isn't that right yes unveiling the tactic of the enemy unveiling what's Spirit what's Soul yes where the real gift is how that that spirit that spirit that second realm of spirit can be Anointed with a genuine Holy Ghost and still not have that word abiding in you and still be lost if that word's in you it was placed in you before the foundation of the world that's why you have the ability to receive by Revelation the word for the season amen and that is your true evidence yes amen amen I'm trying to save time by not reading all these quotes I'm telling you the truth of what they're saying to you all right now John 13 said we're birthed by John 1 Peter 1:23 said we're birthed by the word word Birth by the spoken word brother Bram said the word for the season spoken birs his children amen that's a spoken word birth he said the Bride is a spoken word birth because in your soul is a connector that connects with that word when that eagle heard that voice of that eagle something inside of him resounded to that voice because he was an eagle and because you're a part of that word that voice of God that sounds in this day you receive it because you're a part of it amen yes you hear it it speaks inside opens up what is that opening third pull opening of the word Satan cannot impersonate that he can impersonate any kind of action but he cannot impersonate that opening of the word in you amen amen amen that's hid from him it's been sealed from him and open to us in the end time because now he has nothing more he can do he's been unveiled his scheme's unveiled he can't touch the bride because they know who he is and how he acts and what he does and how he does things that's what the seals opened what have you been feeding on lately videos TV magazines pictures what I'm not saying those things are necessarily wrong if they're the right things but but I I don't have much to say with TV that includes internet I've already been through that okay but what are we feeding on what are you feeding your soul on what's the desire in your soul you can always tell what's in your soul by the desire you have and if you have the desire for more of him then go to the source am don't run away from his presence run into it yes don't walk away run into it Satan could to be right there with something else he that you should do or you could read something pulling on your flesh man so what is it going to take the strength of God to resist and say no you've got a choice don't let him distract you he's depending on us he's not depending on man he's not depending on David he's depending on his own faith in you don't let the Scarecrow of fear keep you from bringing the word in action yes from being the word in action don't let that scarecrow of fear of disruption don't let that scarecrow scare you away from taking a hold of that word and you stand right there I don't care how unreasonable it is boy I should have got some Amen on that amen because that's the truth I don't care how unreasonable it looks like in your in your eyes in your feelings the word's the word right right and what do you believe are you going to be willing to take the word over your senses over your feelings over your imagination over your conscience over your memory yes are you either a possessor of the enemy's Gates or not those are Gates see Cas feel smell and hear are gates to the outer man imagination reasoning memory conscious affection are gates to the spirit but there's only one gate to that Soul all right now let's look at something here now remember this Christ in the true church is a continuation of the book of Acts Satan fights Revelation he'll fight it until he's cast into the Lake of Fire okay he cannot stand it he knows that if the people get the true revelation of the true church the bride or who you are and that and what she is if they get a true revelation of what you are of who you are what you are what you are he doesn't say say who you are he said what you are when she what she stands for True revelation of what she is what she stands for and that she can do the Greater Works she will be an army Invincible Army that's not able to be defeated do you realize that you're not able to be defeated how much better could you have it you're standing perfect in Christ absolutely sinless quit listening to the devil that's putting his fingers say CCE you did this you thought this you did this you did this you did that you did this you I didn't do any of it because the word in me wouldn't do that and that's who I am the believer is Prophet said the believer is the faith of God that moves in you okay the revelation of God himself God Is My Rock Amen Rock The Prophet said speaking of Psalm 62 Rock in the Bible speaks of Revelation Upon This Rock I'll build my church God is David God's God Is My Rock he said brother man said notice David saying God is my Revelation right what's your revelation the same Rock that's my identification none of these others things identify me that identifies me then the word is my amen is my ultimate that's what I believe that's who I am that's what I that's what that's that little wheel that everything I do everything I say I don't care how bad it is and how upside down it looks looks I'm resting in his ability to turn it right side up and put it where it belongs if I'm depending on my senses to do it you got Pride you've got a big head you've got you've got yourself in the picture instead of the word and it's going to cause contentions so one of us or both of us need to and I'm talking about between people I know what it is between God I need to die yeah cuz God isn't Pride it's not contention I have contention because of Pride but one of us need to die to oursel and forgive the other one and let go of it and pray together and put it in God's hands and go on and walk and do what the word said to do and said Lord line me up with your perfect will I don't care what it takes I don't care what it looks like I lose I don't and God gave his perfect will to that Rich Young Ruler said sell all you have and give it to the poor well I just got too many friends that look up to me you know and too much of this hold on me this grip the thing that really destroys preachers and and any anybody really every M of the Bride is popularity women and money that right absolutely right amen amen and God and I mean excuse me Satan knows your weakness that's the part you got to keep covered amen that's the part you keep covered by prayer when things just look like it's upside down take it to God get Alone by yourself whatever you got to do take it to the Lord say God take this thing out of me that wants me to dispute over this you know what I need to do what needs to be done you know what needs to be done with someone else or others or whatever just committ it to God I don't know how many times that I've committed something to God and let go of it and sometimes a matter of minutes sometimes a matter of hours sometimes a day or two and it's taken care of supernaturally taken care of and it's over with I know and and the greatest thing you have the greatest the greatest power brother the greatest pow as you have is committal to be able to commit things to the Lord now I'm going to probably run out of time I don't even know what time it is this thing not working all right okay now so if they get a true revelation of the see of those two spirits and don't put it out here and say well two Spirits he's of that Spirit no you got two right here you've got a spirit man that's going to war against you you've got one that keeps him under control right right amen all right so so who are he's made us Kings and Priests but who are you who are are you given to rule over this boy yeah right they're the fault Lord uh Lord it wasn't me Adam it was my wife but you accepted it and it's put on your shoulders you're responsible for her she's not responsible for you amen amen amen but she's yes she's the one that fell why because she didn't she come under another headship instead of her husband now he's going to rule over you you are an equal basis now he's going to rule over you and you're going to be subject to him and if you really love him you'll give him everything you've got that's a broad statement but go in the message and find out and let him rule whether you you like the way he rules or not I don't necessarily like the way God rules over me I don't feel good by it sometimes but his but his leadership is perfect and if your if your leadership isn't quite perfect take it to his head pray over it commit it to God change him and if he doesn't change that doesn't mean you don't serve I'm going to serve him whether I understand or not and you serve your husband whether you understand or not unless he tells you to do something contrary to the word that's right you don't have to live that way because if he makes you go out here and cut your hair and wear your can't go to church and and wear your pants and you got to do this you're not subject to that because the Lord is your head above him but by serving him you're serving the lord brother brand asked the question should I my husband doesn't believe should I withhold myself said don't you dare withhold yourself self from him see see so we I'm getting on another subject I don't mean to do that I'm why back on that again but anyway let's go on here so Revelation is going to take the operation of the Holy Ghost it's not going to take ordinary study to make this book real it's going to take the operation of the Holy Ghost that means this book can't be revealed to anyone but a special class of people it will take one with prophetic Insight it'll take the ability require the ability to hear from God now I'm going to have to go on here pretty quick I'm not I'm going to bypass the evidence here brother Brandon thought it was love it's not love he said it's Revelation is the genuine of the evidence of the Holy Ghost is that he will teach you and show you things to come amen so and and the Lord corrected him on that amen that's that's found in 647 0726 evening if you want to look that up all right let's look at this real gift a minute the real gift he said he said that the I got the baptism of the Holy Ghost now that's required we have to come through that baptism but the baptism of the Holy Ghost is the temporal gift to you and it makes room for something it makes way for something yes that has nothing to do with nothing to do with it it's a temporal gift for you see see why won't all people receive it it wasn't sent to them see other words receive it they had the baptism they can have it on their Spirit but that soul is the germ that Third Realm is the germ the Third Realm watch what he says here and I'm bypassing because I have a lot of I want to read some quotes out of Christ revealed his own word but I don't have time but I want to just I'll come back to that another time but you've heard those things anyway but here he said it's sent to them to those who will believe yes God gave His only begotten son that whosoever believeth in him should not perish see there's a depth to that scripture that people quote it all the time and don't know what they're quoting because when were you a believer in him when were you a believer in him you were a believer in him before the foundation of the world yes sir there you are that's who he came to die for that's who he came to to to redeem yet he poured himself off for the whole world but not the whole world won't receive it who will whosoever believeth in him is that right yet he makes the way for everybody even Cain was made made the way for he could have come under that sacrifice without sacrificing well no he couldn't have because G God said to him he said if you'll do like your brother you do well you'll be accepted so he had to make the sacrifice but he wasn't willing to make that sacrifice why wrong seed yes sir so not all can receive it that's right some will some won't but it depends on the seed all right so he says here he said that's why he's saying it wasn't sent to them that are not the seed is sent to those who will believe the message is to the believer to them that perish it's foolishness what do you mean brother Bram to them this perish they weren't in God's thinking they weren't in the Eternal thoughts of God Amen but his bride was you were in the Eternal thoughts of God how do you know you've got the evidence you're able to hear or receive by revelation in the word for the season you respond to it and it lives through you amen and God's asking us to come to that total dependency and meet my need I'm depending on you you're my wife you're taking care you're serving me who serves her husband the wife the position of the wife is serving her husband then what are you in God's sight serving him amen do you see what I'm trying to say it's serving him who serves her husband he she does what's she meeting his need what's his need to glorify and manifest him fellowship with him he wants Fellowship he needs love he needs respect he needs reverence he needs a Godly fear of reverential respect and reverence to him that's exactly what a married life should represent and and and show is that very thing what' he do for you he's giving himself every day for you what do you do in return see you serve him by what I guess I have to I guess I got to go to church time to go to church no you serve him by love you love him and love creates faith without love there'd be no faith without agape love perfect love I'm not talking about fio you can love God through a felio love and love love him that's right but still be lost and go to hell you realize that because in your spirit is FAL love that love that that love can be in your spirit you can actually be baptized in your spirit have the love of God have love love that FAL Love Is Love of God too it's just a lower love are you with me it's a friendship love it's a human love God put that there brother Bram said God we have the love for my wife I FAL her I love her because she's my she's my sister in one hand but she's part of me she's my wife yeah but there's something that's got to be above that or I wouldn't have stayed with her for 52 years oh I might have I shouldn't say I wouldn't have but you see what I'm trying to say what kept us what's holding us what's holding the disruption because I love her I'm willing to give up for her I'm willing to honor her as a weaker vessel and the wife should be willing to say Amen takes all the all the stress out of it I can give myself up to my husband and he's responsible see it keeps typing back and forth I would love to and God help me if maybe if God let her open the door I have a sermon right now I've had holding it for years I'd like to preach on is father's fathers husbands husbands where are you men men where are you remember called for Adam Adam Adam where are you you're out of your position Adam you're out of your place sisters women mothers where are you and put it back in the word not some psychology teaching of a self-help book but putting it back as a husband and wife wife should reflect the husband and wife the bride in the groom it's a revelation it lays in Revelation hey man I'm not going to go there I get started I won't stop all right so we it would take probably several parts but anyway God knows so now I'm just going to have to bypass this but that seed germ is in that Third Realm that's the real gift so the real gift brother Bram said he said to them that perish is foolishness but but to them that are in Christ a part of the seed it's life the real gift is your soul down in there he said brother Braham said the baptism is a temporal gift he said the real gift is your soul down there that that baptism watered on quickened that seed germ what is that seed germ can't be anything else but Jesus Christ yeah God himself yeah amen hallelujah that's right all right so he said he said that real gift is your soul down in there that was born of God and that controls the whole thing to the word of God and the will of God and there you grow up mature see then you're a son and daughter of God you're a child of God you're a Son of God coming forth and you see the word said I should do this I should be born again well I belong to church that don't mean one thing well I'm I I'm Pentecostal I belong if you don't line up with that word there's something wrong then you see your real father raising God because that real start is in your soul the real start the real you you know you realize that the real you is what your soul is it's not how you make believe out here and how you can dress up like a real believer and conduct yourself with such Purity and all these stuff it's what's in the soul because you can be a hypocrite and be something different in the soul and dress up and act like and have pictures on the wall and everything of a Believer that's right and say I'm a believer I'm a I'm a message believer and have no Revelation and just a head knowledge of the word see but that Soul then there's something else different in your soul what are you you're trying to pretend something you're not but I say Lord help us every one of us to live what we are in the soul I can be what I am in the soul Jesus knew his position Jesus knew who he was amen that was the faith he walked in right there now the same thing will be the bride because whatever he was we are and all we are he was did you know that all that we are he is and all that he is we are that's the true unveiling of God to you and I amen all right now if that Soul do come from God it wasn't a germ of God to begin with then you're deceived see see what how see how it comes right down all right now let's see I maybe just have to quit right now who can lay anything no I've got to cover this one more can you give me just five minutes is that all right let me finish just one thing let's turn to Romans 8 Romans chapter 8 I don't even know what time it is I'm sorry I probably way over time and I don't even know it so it's my ignorance isn't it so you you won't hold me to ignorance all right because I don't have any way I don't even have a phone or nothing to tell time and don't tell me okay Romans 8 verse one there is therefore now no condemnation to them which are in Christ Jesus praise the Lord praise the Lord there is therefore now no judgment to them which are in Christ Jesus who walk not after the flesh who are those in Christ Jesus they are those that do not walk after the flesh but after the spirit that's right Hallelujah that's right all right now for the law this is what I want to get to two for the law of the spirit that's Holy Spirit of life eternal life for the law of the spirit of life in Christ Jesus hath made me free free from the law of sin and death you're not under the law the law satisfied you're under grace yes through faith yeah amen all right consider this quoting brother brandom out of the church age book consider this so I want you consider this since it is the blood of God it is perfect blood and if if the perfect blood is loosing us from the power and bondage and defilement of sin then the loosing is perfect and complete there is now no there is now therefore no condemnation who shall lay anything to the charge of God's elect it is God that justifieth declares us righteous that's what justified mean declares us righteous when before the foundation of the world we never did it who is he that condemneth amen it is Christ that died see the scripture goes on rather is risen again see that's Romans 8: 33-34 and brother Bram said there it is his death gave us the blood and the blood carries life see the death gave us the blood and that life is the token the spirit of Life ha made me free from the law of sin and death it's my identification that is the token all right then he said now so so the blood loosed us he gave his blood the blood has loosed us amen you're not chained anymore there is now no condemnation How can there be there is nothing to be condemned for because the blood has loosed us from sin unbelief there's none yes there's none amen devil says you did this you're a liar say Satan you're a liar well I feel no I don't feel anything it's this it's what he said I know that I'm in him it's a revelation to me it's settled I have the judge has already judged me perfect the book's been open I'm judged under the open book of this hour I am judged perfect what did God say about us he said you're perfect you're not condemned you're you're perfect you're free they're you're absolutely sinless go back to to find out what he said this is my message to you bride you're perfect you're sinless you're Justified as though you never did it in the first place yes sir go back to Invisible Union see if that it wasn't God's thought to you amen amen then we need to be taking this word God wants us to take this and point it back at the Devil and say you're lying this is not who I am and bring him the word Jesus defeated the devil on every ground on the basis of the word it is written it is written it is written of who it is written of me it's written of you Hallelujah that's it it's already written of you you're in the book your name and is the Redemption he redeemed you now you're claimed you are claimed you have the token the token is there you claimed it's finished you are claimed you never did it at all you never will do it he that is born of God cannot commit sin and the Son of God is revealed in you for one purpose to destroy d y The Works of the enemy that's 1 John 3:8 and9 and he that hath the son hath life therefore the sun is made manifest in you for that purpose to destroy those deceiving Works those works of the enemy in your life to rule over your life rule over your flesh rule over your members of this body as the king would rule over them yes he's given you the authority now he's depending on Us Praise the Lord all right now see see that's the thing now so who can lay anything to the charge of God's elect all right he's loosed us we are free we're Guiltless don't listen to man listen to the word you are loosed by the blood and in line you are positionally placed in Christ positionally placed and let's recognize our position you are God's free men Loose by his blood bride the bride is the promised word for this day you want to read that go back to doing God a service without his will Jeffersonville the bride is the promised word for this day all right it's either Jeffersonville or shreport I can't remember which one that is but you'll find it all right I had some things to quote in there I'll just bypass that so the thing that's the matter with the message today is those who obtain it in their heart must lay in the presence of the sun to get ripened amen this is maturing time the Sun is up the bride is in Union with her husband the marriage has come she becomes the same selfers as he is she becomes that same selfers he is she becomes him she is him in fact the bride is all of him amen I'm not talking about the bride just this hour the whole bride is all of Him He makes himself known in Bride form the mystery of today is the bride coming of Christ amen all right all right now the bride is pregnated by the word of God and will bring forth the body watch what she will will bring forth she brings forth the finished body of Jesus Christ which is the bride you say the finished body the body of Christ talking about Jesus himself the body of Christ isn't finished yet now watch what he's saying he said how many knows that a man and woman is one and Christ is one body the word the bride will have to be the rest of that body Adam was one body Adam Eve was the rest of that body completed Adam the mystery of Adam it was complete two have make a hole the Old and New Testament make one hole right husband and wife right complete yes so that makes the bride the complete revelation of him the finished body yes all right now he said the two together makes the one body again like Adam was at the beginning man and his wife are one she the true bride is sold out to him and she has no uses she uses no mind of her own his mind of course is his will and his will is his word and that's our mind amen now in this day now watch The Promise because now we see the Promise being fulfilled Christ the true headship going in his bride coming in his bride now watch that's the that's the promise now brother Braham said now we see it being fulfilled okay now but in this day there's to come a super Royal Seed of Abraham that's exactly what it would be would be a royal bride to the Royal promised son there is to come in this day as I spoke last night it won't be a natural seed it would be a spiritual seed there is to be a spiritual bride raised up which will be the Royal seed of the royal faith of Abraham's royal son she's to come on the scene in the last days and the time and place is a promise that's given given to her amen Revelation 10 Malachi 4 Luke 17 promise to her yes therefore when he came on Earth and was manifested in flesh you were in him then because he was the word so the mystery is that he was the word in the beginning was the word the word was with God the Word was God there you are amen all right said see and the Word was made flesh and dwelt Among Us that's the mystery how it came became from word to flesh amen amen that's the new birth you're Birth by that spoken word 1 Peter 1:23 okay now there is a spiritual bride to raise up amen so therefore the word was made flesh and dwelt Among Us the word was made flesh therefore you walked with him when and you were in him when he was on Earth you suffered with him you died with him you was buried with him and now you are risen with him now you are risen with him shall I repeat that amen you've already passed from Death to life you suffered with him you died with him you're buried with him now you're risen with him and manifested manifested attribute of God setting in Heavenly places already raised already resurrected to New Life what a resurrection this is see here now and setting in Heavenly places in Christ oh that means so much to us nowadays church that means so much to us to see ourselves positionally placed in Jesus Christ so now as I said we see the Promise being fulfilled the bride coming of Christ the second coming a secret catching away to a meeting in the air amen you say secret yes because that's the seventh seal the silence denoted as secret amen that's what it is it opened in silence so did the book so did Revelation 10 silent so what is the seventh seal what John Couldn't Write Hallelujah where's it going to be revealed in you not public in you does not come with observation it comes in you so who are you living for what is your purpose here what are you doing here declaring him in Simplicity simple see nobody's but he's willing to take up a nobody and manifest himself through it stand together now we see the Promise being fulfilled Christ's the true headship going in coming in in his bride going in you see how the prophet stated that going in where's where's it going they're marching step of the word eyes upon the word not looking out here at this looking at this oh this one did this this one did that they were distracted got out of Step but stead back in the word why their focus where is their focus I'm talk about the bride marching that he saw marching amen and where did they March they kept going forward they didn't turn around what did they do they kept going forward they didn't stop they were in March they were moving moving in you Faith Of God moving walking marching where were they going they didn't go down they just kept getting up up up and they went right on up what took them up that word the message message the word for the season the word for the hour this brother Bram said this message has got rapturing faith in it this has got the secret of the Rapture aren't you glad we have a message like that that we become we are that message living Amen in action amen amen so what do we have brother sister what do we have we have the devil's answer is no more I living it's Christ in me amen that is who I am it's no longer you can point
