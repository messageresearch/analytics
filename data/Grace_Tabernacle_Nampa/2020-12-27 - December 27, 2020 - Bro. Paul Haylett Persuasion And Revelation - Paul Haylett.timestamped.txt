[33:45] not what i want to be not what i should
[33:48] be but
[33:49] thank you lord we are not what we used
[33:52] to be
[33:53] hallelujah aren't you glad today where
[33:56] we can
[33:57] make that declaration that while
[33:59] sometimes we might feel
[34:01] frustrated in the flesh you know what
[34:03] i'm talking about
[34:05] yeah lord why did i do this why did i
[34:07] say that why did i think that
[34:09] just remember he's working on you
[34:13] and remember he said this work i began
[34:17] i will finish so we couldn't finish it
[34:19] if we wanted to
[34:22] so he is doing that work and how
[34:24] beautiful
[34:25] amen god bless you brother scott sister
[34:28] kristen's
[34:29] dad and brother scott we are gonna maybe
[34:32] make this the time we quit identifying
[34:34] you as
[34:35] sister kristen's dad you are simply our
[34:38] brother scott is with us
[34:40] and we are so happy to have him here
[34:42] amen
[34:43] uh just pray god bless you in this time
[34:46] with your family
[34:47] and we forgot to put it in the prayer
[34:49] request please remember my uh daughter
[34:51] jolyn's sister jolin
[34:53] uh woke up this morning with a migraine
[34:55] and uh you know the devil he just likes
[34:57] to slip
[34:58] in when he can and just cause a problem
[35:00] and
[35:01] and uh you know we'll just rebuke him in
[35:03] the name of jesus christ
[35:05] amen god bless you brother sergey glad
[35:08] to see you home
[35:09] amen well
[35:12] you know we don't celebrate this
[35:14] christmas season like a bunch of pagans
[35:17] right amen
[35:21] but did you enjoy the time
[35:24] it is to me saints i you know you know
[35:27] you notice i never preached a single
[35:28] sermon
[35:29] about christmas you see to me
[35:33] it's not about saying oh oh christ in
[35:36] the manger
[35:38] we know the prophet showed us clearly in
[35:41] the word lambs are born in the spring
[35:43] amen he wasn't born in a snow bank
[35:46] somewhere
[35:47] hallelujah but we'll take this just the
[35:49] same approach as we take easter
[35:52] it's not about bunnies and eggs and
[35:54] whatever else
[35:55] so to us it means something entirely
[35:59] different than to the world amen we're
[36:02] out here
[36:03] it is to me let me just put it in that
[36:05] way that way if you want to chunk it
[36:06] chunk it
[36:08] but um it's just a season that kind of
[36:10] comes and says you know what
[36:12] um time to give a nice gift to someone
[36:15] a little season a reason you might say
[36:17] to just do something kind or
[36:19] share something and um you know it's
[36:23] such a point my brother and sister that
[36:26] that you know if we're not careful we
[36:28] kind of tend to find ourselves being
[36:29] pulled back
[36:30] in to the view that the world has of
[36:32] christmas
[36:34] and uh let's just not forget amen that
[36:37] the reason for our season amen is jesus
[36:41] christ
[36:42] and that season is 365 days
[36:46] long hallelujah so
[36:49] don't just use this time you feel
[36:51] something on your heart to give a gift
[36:53] to say thank you to say i love you it
[36:56] can be any
[36:57] day of the year you don't have to wait
[36:59] for that one specific day
[37:02] so well saints i'm going to do something
[37:04] today that i have
[37:05] uh not really done before uh i am going
[37:09] to preach to you
[37:10] a sermon that i preached one week ago
[37:14] in evening like tabernacle in phoenix
[37:17] but
[37:18] the burden of this thought is heavy upon
[37:21] me
[37:22] uh it is something that i feel that
[37:25] needs to be spoken here also
[37:28] as we were coming up had this invitation
[37:31] to
[37:31] um to minister there in phoenix
[37:36] this thought come upon me and i could
[37:39] not
[37:40] shake it i think i even voiced it in the
[37:43] message there in phoenix that
[37:45] you kind of feel good there's so many
[37:47] good things my brother and sister
[37:49] and you kind of think well we'll go down
[37:51] there we'll preach them happy
[37:53] and people remember how that brother
[37:55] paul come to phoenix
[37:57] and he just preached such a happy you
[37:59] know we all shouted and went away happy
[38:01] or we can be made happy by being ready
[38:04] for the rapture
[38:06] and so we can satisfy the flesh and
[38:09] being able to say well that was
[38:10] wonderful
[38:11] i could verify every quote every idea
[38:13] everything and i just went away
[38:15] feeling so free or we can be forced
[38:20] to the edges of our boundaries tested to
[38:22] our limits
[38:23] caused to think outside of our normal
[38:26] realm
[38:27] and then realize with joy in our heart
[38:30] i'm being made ready for a rapture
[38:33] and so i i just uh uh uh
[38:36] just wanted to put that as a preface to
[38:39] you today that you would know
[38:41] uh if by chance you knew someone or
[38:43] something come up you'd say hey wait
[38:45] brother paul
[38:46] is just plagiarizing himself it is
[38:49] on purpose sister jerry i will throw her
[38:52] under the bus this morning when i said i
[38:53] feel led to preach that again she said
[38:55] you're a lazy preacher
[38:57] and amen sister jerry did you not say
[39:01] that
[39:02] and uh but i feel this upon my heart
[39:05] saints
[39:06] and so i want to give this to you up
[39:08] front to tell you
[39:10] i might be preaching you today like
[39:13] something's inadequate in you
[39:14] something there's a fault there's a
[39:16] failure there's something
[39:17] but i want you to understand that i am
[39:20] here today going to preach
[39:22] very direct to you but i'm here to stir
[39:25] up your pure minds
[39:27] in remembrance this is not like you
[39:30] could go away today and say i think
[39:32] brother paul thinks we're all going to
[39:34] miss the rapture
[39:35] no not at all i want to stir up to you
[39:38] in your pure minds
[39:40] the recollection of the fact that the
[39:43] things we're going to speak on today
[39:45] can happen here and if we are not
[39:48] cognizant if we are not careful if we
[39:51] are not
[39:52] making sure that our lamp is trimmed
[39:56] and clear and full each and every day
[40:00] this could be us that's what i want to
[40:03] stir your minds today if we'll stand
[40:04] we'll go right in the word thank you
[40:06] for the jason musicians amen aren't you
[40:09] thankful amen for the gifts that god has
[40:11] given in the body
[40:12] amen sometimes the gift is just a matter
[40:15] of saying
[40:16] amen that is truly actually more of a
[40:18] gift than you might imagine
[40:20] amen so as we'll look at this i want to
[40:22] start by reading second peter
[40:24] first second peter the third chapter
[40:26] first and second verses
[40:28] just to start off in our thought this
[40:31] second epistle beloved
[40:33] i now write unto you in both which i
[40:35] stir up your pure minds by way of
[40:37] remembrance
[40:39] that you may be mindful of the words
[40:41] which were spoken before by the holy
[40:43] prophets
[40:44] and of the commandment of us the
[40:46] apostles of the lord
[40:47] and savior so once again
[40:51] just to lay that foundation that we're
[40:52] here this morning
[40:54] amen no pastor will save you
[40:59] unfortunately we have a little thing
[41:01] that ripples through the message every
[41:02] once in a while that
[41:04] people have an idea that if we just
[41:06] acknowledge that god sent a prophet
[41:08] that that somehow is an absolute
[41:10] game-changer
[41:11] you can go on youtube if you care to and
[41:14] you'll find people will talk about the
[41:15] supernatural ministry
[41:17] of brother branham but don't do one
[41:20] thing
[41:21] to follow it
[41:24] okay i want you to understand we're not
[41:27] speaking down to the prophet we're
[41:28] actually speaking
[41:29] up to him when we say you know what god
[41:32] sent him that voice my brother and
[41:34] sister was to turn
[41:35] us to jesus christ and so we
[41:38] many people i've been accused of it
[41:40] actually right here in the foyer of this
[41:42] church accused
[41:43] of putting brother branham down but to
[41:45] me my brother and sister i'm sorry it
[41:47] shows their lack of understanding
[41:49] because you see brother branham himself
[41:51] said i came to point you to jesus christ
[41:55] so for us to look to christ in christ
[41:57] alone is actually to acknowledge we're
[42:00] believing what the prophet taught us
[42:02] amen in no way does that put brother
[42:05] branham to the side no way does that
[42:07] you know put him down or dismiss him
[42:11] but when someone tells you something
[42:14] and you believe them my brother and
[42:16] sister that's
[42:18] a great compliment
[42:22] to ignore what someone would share when
[42:24] he said thou
[42:25] sayeth the lord to ignore that my
[42:27] brother and sister is actually putting
[42:29] the prophet down
[42:31] but to believe the word that he brought
[42:35] is actually you see i'm not much of a
[42:37] man worshiper
[42:38] i just really struggle with that went
[42:40] through that that dose when i was a
[42:41] child sister sue's smiling real big here
[42:43] she knows what that is
[42:46] we're not men worshipers so we got to
[42:50] find the balance ourself of where do we
[42:51] put
[42:52] each and every one right
[42:55] well the scripture says to love your
[42:57] brother your sister
[42:58] your neighbor as yourself
[43:02] now if you hate yourself you can get by
[43:04] treating them terribly
[43:06] and justify but the scripture goes on to
[43:10] say no man hateth his own flesh
[43:14] you see god help us god help us
[43:19] okay well let's just turn in
[43:22] luke the 16th chapter today
[43:26] amen and i want to take my
[43:29] thought out of this and we will expound
[43:32] upon it
[43:33] by god's grace there was a certain rich
[43:36] man
[43:37] now my brother and sister if you'll go
[43:39] study
[43:40] i guess you would call it theology they
[43:43] believe that this rich man is the rich
[43:45] young ruler
[43:47] many people in the world of theology
[43:49] make a connection that this
[43:50] is a rich young ruler i have voiced it
[43:54] to you so i've now influenced you on
[43:56] that
[43:57] but i don't want you to absolutely say
[43:59] brother paul said
[44:00] but i'm telling you that you can see
[44:03] where this rich
[44:04] young ruler come to a place in his life
[44:06] where he said i i've done all of the
[44:08] things you've told me
[44:11] i want to lay this platform for you he
[44:13] says i've done
[44:14] all that you told me but when jesus told
[44:17] him
[44:18] sell all thou hast you realize those
[44:21] words were just as important as all the
[44:24] words previous to that
[44:26] you can say oh i'm following the great
[44:28] revelations of jesus christ
[44:30] but if he tells you lay down your life
[44:32] and you refuse to
[44:34] you may as well not bothered with
[44:35] everything else because you've now
[44:37] found the one word in the word that you
[44:40] refuse to follow
[44:42] oh god help us this is how tricky satan
[44:45] can be
[44:46] that we can come to a point well that's
[44:47] an opinion
[44:49] is it
[44:53] there was a certain rich man
[44:56] who was clothed in purple fine linen and
[44:59] fared sumptuously every day
[45:01] and there was a certain beggar named
[45:03] lazarus
[45:04] which was laid at his gate full of sores
[45:07] now
[45:07] he wasn't at the joneses gate
[45:11] he was at this rich man's gate i don't
[45:14] think there's
[45:15] any question god ordained
[45:18] that to be so amen
[45:25] laid at his gate full of sores and
[45:27] desiring to be fed with the crumbs which
[45:29] fell from the rich man's table
[45:31] moreover the dogs came and licked his
[45:33] sores and it came to pass that the
[45:35] beggar died
[45:36] and was carried by the angels into
[45:38] abraham's bosom
[45:40] the rich man also died and was
[45:43] buried now my brother and sister if we
[45:46] didn't go any farther
[45:48] than verse 22 we will see the stark
[45:51] difference of the transformation
[45:54] of death one is carried by the angels
[45:58] into the bosom of abraham
[46:00] and the other one buried
[46:05] do you realize my brother and sister if
[46:06] the lord tarries
[46:08] every one of us will be buried
[46:13] but do you realize in the very i
[46:16] what is the right word it just passed by
[46:19] me so quickly here
[46:21] in the very essence of death
[46:24] sons and daughters of god come right in
[46:26] the presence of almighty
[46:28] amen we we don't go in the ground and
[46:30] rot and then one day god comes
[46:32] amen that might be our bones that's
[46:34] there might be identified as this is the
[46:36] resting place of so and so
[46:39] but you see the scripture so clearly
[46:41] right here says
[46:43] that uh the beggar died laos earth and
[46:46] carried by the angels abraham's
[46:47] rich man also died and was buried
[46:50] and in hell he lift up his eyes being in
[46:55] torments
[46:56] and seeth abraham afar off and lazarus
[46:58] in his bosom
[46:59] and he cried and said father abraham
[47:01] have mercy on me send lazarus and he may
[47:03] dip the tip of his finger
[47:05] in water and cool my tongue for i am
[47:07] tormented
[47:08] in this flame and i see brother chris
[47:10] took the leftovers of his
[47:12] water bottle or i'd make an example if
[47:14] you're thirsty
[47:15] amen just how much quenching power
[47:19] is of the water that could rest or
[47:21] reside on the tip of your finger
[47:25] wouldn't do much for even a natural
[47:27] thirst would it
[47:30] amen brother will we move on please amen
[47:34] but abraham said son remember that thou
[47:36] in thy lifetime
[47:38] receiveth thou good things and likewise
[47:40] lazarus evil things
[47:42] but now he is comforted and thou art
[47:44] tormented
[47:45] and beside all this between us and you
[47:48] there is a great goal fixed
[47:50] so that they which would pass from hints
[47:52] to you cannot
[47:53] neither can they pass to us that would
[47:56] come from thence
[47:57] then he said i pray thee therefore
[47:59] father that thou would ascend him to my
[48:02] father's house
[48:03] for i have five brethren that he may
[48:05] testify unto them lest they
[48:07] also come into this place of torment and
[48:10] abraham saith unto him
[48:12] they have moses and the prophets let
[48:15] them
[48:15] hear them amen as we move on
[48:19] and he said nay father abraham but if
[48:22] one went unto them from the dead they
[48:24] will repent
[48:25] and he said unto him if they hear not
[48:29] moses and the prophets neither
[48:33] will they be persuaded the one rose
[48:37] from the dead i would like to speak to
[48:40] you this morning
[48:42] on persuasion and revelation
[48:46] heavenly father we just ask you lord to
[48:47] come lord you know every need
[48:50] father you know every needs of our
[48:51] hearts of our natural life
[48:53] we ask you to come this morning father
[48:56] speak to us lord that
[48:57] father we just have a life-changing
[49:00] event lord just each day moving forward
[49:02] with more of you
[49:04] lord we love you we adore you we call
[49:07] upon your name and ask your father
[49:09] to reveal yourself to us today by your
[49:12] word
[49:12] in the name of jesus christ amen you may
[49:15] be
[49:16] seated saints
[49:31] now as we'll look at this i want to just
[49:33] go back through this scripture for a
[49:35] moment
[49:36] uh this morning we'll look at this we
[49:38] understand uh certainly of the scripture
[49:40] a rich man
[49:41] he had everything that he needed in life
[49:44] he ate sumptuously it says
[49:46] every day and uh certainly in the
[49:48] holiday season can you imagine eating
[49:50] like that
[49:51] all year round amen that would be
[49:53] considered sumptuous right just the best
[49:55] of
[49:56] everything uh nothing spared and and so
[50:00] i know why we wouldn't want to eat that
[50:02] way because we know what we would look
[50:03] like if we did
[50:05] but um you know here's a man who just
[50:07] had the best and
[50:08] here is lazarus laying not by chance i
[50:12] do not believe my brother and sister how
[50:14] this would come about
[50:15] but he's laying right here at this rich
[50:17] man's gate
[50:18] and you know as you would think about
[50:20] this this rich man as he would pass to
[50:22] and from
[50:23] his home from his estate he would have
[50:26] had to have passed by
[50:28] lazarus now my brother and sister we are
[50:30] looking at a man
[50:32] that in our terms would be a christian
[50:34] we're looking at a man that that was not
[50:36] a heathen he was not uh someone that was
[50:40] just uh
[50:41] of the callous careless nature of of a
[50:44] a rich man of humanity but this was a
[50:47] man who
[50:48] uh if you would just uh let me or grant
[50:51] to me the privilege of just kind of
[50:53] uh filling in the narrative of this this
[50:55] is a man
[50:56] who went to church every week this was a
[50:58] man who gave to the church and
[51:00] he is walking by lazarus now my brother
[51:03] and sister we can become this callous
[51:05] ourselves if we are not careful
[51:07] where we would look at people and say
[51:08] you know that's just an unbeliever
[51:10] that's just a worldly person
[51:12] not just somebody you know they've said
[51:14] this or they've done that oh they're
[51:15] getting what they deserve
[51:17] look my brother and sister don't ever go
[51:18] there because you see
[51:20] it's not a reflection of who they are
[51:22] it's actually a reflection of who we
[51:24] are amen and if we become callous to
[51:26] those things
[51:27] then we will find that it will infect
[51:29] our life in such a way that we will
[51:31] become callous to many things
[51:33] and so as he come there my brother and
[51:35] sister what would have stopped this rich
[51:38] man
[51:39] from from stopping there at the gate and
[51:41] turning to one of his servants and
[51:43] saying
[51:43] you know in my wealth that god has
[51:45] blessed me in
[51:47] i want you to take this man down here to
[51:49] the clinic
[51:50] and i want you to get him some medical
[51:53] care
[51:53] i i want you to do something because he
[51:57] is a fellow man of mankind
[52:00] i can do this and not even notice it
[52:02] would just be a fraction
[52:04] of maybe my earnings for a day to to do
[52:06] this for him and
[52:08] and you know could we find uh you know
[52:10] food for him
[52:11] but you see in the callousness of we are
[52:14] better than they
[52:15] it would come to the place that this
[52:17] simply why i can just see it in my mind
[52:20] saying
[52:20] why would he choose my driveway
[52:25] can't we get the city or someone to to
[52:28] take him away
[52:29] put him on another side of town as the
[52:31] old phrase used to be
[52:33] put him on the other side of the tracks
[52:37] but you see god knows how to stage
[52:40] everything and
[52:40] i would tell you my brother and sister
[52:42] this morning god will stage things
[52:45] in your life in my life that will cause
[52:47] us to react
[52:48] and i pray god that we react correctly
[52:52] amen now we can disagree with people and
[52:54] i say we can bitterly or vehemently
[52:57] disagree with people
[52:58] but we can still love them can you amen
[53:01] to that
[53:02] amen we don't have to all be on the same
[53:04] little soapbox rubbing
[53:06] shoulders happy he's just like me those
[53:08] are called parrots
[53:12] we can stand firm for what we believe
[53:14] but yet love the person
[53:19] when we come to the place that we
[53:21] because someone would disagree with us
[53:23] say well they're
[53:24] they're lost their deceiver they are
[53:26] deceived they're this
[53:27] no my brother and sister wrong attitude
[53:30] wrong attitude
[53:31] amen so we see him now that he was
[53:35] desiring
[53:36] lazarus just desiring to receive some
[53:38] crumbs from this rich man's table
[53:41] now i don't know about you but the
[53:43] holidays sometimes i think kind of tend
[53:45] to make us a tad bit wasteful
[53:47] amen i think you know we have so much on
[53:49] the table
[53:50] there's ham there's turkey there there's
[53:53] a roast or prime rib or
[53:55] you know and there's pies and there's
[53:57] cookies and and there's
[53:58] all of this stuff and you've had a great
[54:01] feast
[54:02] and yet you would have just a little bit
[54:04] left over if you understand what i'm
[54:06] saying
[54:07] just a little bit left over and that
[54:10] we'll pick on salad i'm salad and i are
[54:12] just at a truce we're not really friends
[54:14] so
[54:14] i i don't have any bad feelings about uh
[54:17] doing this to mr salad
[54:19] but uh you know we bring it to the place
[54:21] we look in the bowl and we say
[54:23] you know we've eaten so much salad this
[54:25] this holiday
[54:26] season uh this might well sit in the
[54:28] fridge and spoil
[54:30] so we open up the trash can and scrape
[54:33] the last little bit of salad in there
[54:36] that's not just our household is it
[54:40] thank you you're all looking at me so
[54:41] solemn i was scared that
[54:43] it was only jerry and i that were this
[54:46] wasteful
[54:50] now i'll tell you what you don't do you
[54:52] don't ever come down and say man that
[54:54] last piece of pumpkin pie is too small
[54:56] to deal with
[54:59] no matter how small that piece of
[55:00] pumpkin pie is it's worth dealing with
[55:03] but there are certain things in our life
[55:05] right little jello salad little macaroni
[55:07] salad a little caesar
[55:09] a little whatever he is you know and
[55:11] we'll have a problem there's this
[55:13] scrape it away lazarus is laying in the
[55:15] gate
[55:16] wishing he could eat from the trash of a
[55:19] rich man
[55:23] look at the disparity one eating
[55:25] sumptuously
[55:27] i just have to share this with you if
[55:29] you don't mind a moment of of humor
[55:31] uh brother rich and i texting away on
[55:33] thanksgiving day
[55:35] and brother rich i don't even know how
[55:36] you do it maybe somebody could show me
[55:38] but
[55:38] he had this little talking pig that said
[55:42] we're having baby back ribs today
[55:46] you know where that came from
[55:49] so i just sent him a picture of our
[55:51] prime rib and he's like that's not fair
[55:55] well my brother and sister sometimes
[55:57] life is not fair
[56:00] so to top it all off i decided if we're
[56:02] not playing fair
[56:03] i sent him a picture of my daughter
[56:05] kristen's pumpkin pie
[56:07] and he was just like what
[56:13] lazarus just wanted
[56:17] the crumbs
[56:20] from our table amen
[56:26] oh my there's so many avenues we could
[56:28] go
[56:30] see he was just desiring even just the
[56:33] barest
[56:34] of existence of subsistence and we'd
[56:37] look at that and think that poor beggar
[56:39] there he is but my brother and sister i
[56:42] might get ahead of myself a little bit
[56:44] lazarus had something that the rich man
[56:48] could never have spent all of his money
[56:51] to have obtained who is the rich man
[56:55] here
[56:56] lazarus the beggar starving to death
[57:00] on the curb and dogs licking his sores
[57:02] was in the eyes of god
[57:04] the rich man amen and look how this
[57:07] comes about
[57:08] and you know when they pass it was the
[57:11] angels that come and
[57:13] got lazarus and took them away and i say
[57:16] lord i pray that each and every one of
[57:18] us
[57:18] is in a position in our life if we pass
[57:20] from this life
[57:21] that the angels are what carries us away
[57:24] hallelujah and you look
[57:26] and so we see how he is there in this
[57:28] great gulf and he's desiring now look
[57:30] his training my brother and sister let
[57:32] me fill in this narrative just a little
[57:34] bit
[57:35] he was grounded enough that when he's in
[57:38] hell he's looking across the gulf
[57:40] and he knows that is father abraham
[57:44] he's not there saying hey lazarus i
[57:46] don't know who you're with
[57:47] but could no father abraham
[57:51] father abraham i know who you are i was
[57:55] born in church i went to sunday school
[57:58] i heard the preaching of the word i was
[58:01] in the youth group
[58:02] i went to youth camp i was baptized in
[58:05] the name of jesus christ
[58:07] i've done all of this how could it be
[58:10] that i am here
[58:15] he woke up in hell
[58:19] and saying someone asked you the
[58:20] question this morning how does that
[58:22] happen
[58:25] young people please listen to me this
[58:27] morning give me your attention
[58:30] sitting in a church praying over your
[58:33] food
[58:34] going to sunday school youth group all
[58:36] of these things being baptized
[58:38] my that is not an assurance
[58:42] that's right you're going to heaven
[58:45] not opposed to each and every one of us
[58:48] this is why i told you i might speak
[58:49] kind of straight this morning
[58:51] i just pray that you'll follow why
[58:53] because i'm here
[58:54] as your pastor to stir up your pure
[58:57] mindset we don't become
[58:58] lazy message believers now we don't
[59:01] think just because we can check
[59:03] these things off everything is okay
[59:06] but here he was this rich man having his
[59:09] whole life look at the rich young ruler
[59:11] if we go ahead and tie that together
[59:13] he looks jesus in the face and said i
[59:16] have done
[59:16] all of these things
[59:21] good i can imagine
[59:25] jesus pat him on the back that's good
[59:30] now all you've got to do is sell all
[59:33] thou has and give it to the poor
[59:40] could it be
[59:44] that jesus saw lazarus
[59:49] amen maybe before lazarus
[59:52] even ended up at his driveway he saw him
[59:57] laid the foundation for him to look out
[1:00:00] there and say you know what the city's
[1:00:01] got a lot of poor people
[1:00:02] i i need to do something for him now
[1:00:05] this is purely paul's opinion okay
[1:00:07] everybody acknowledge that
[1:00:08] i believe with all of my heart the rich
[1:00:11] young ruler
[1:00:12] if he had see now god guests and
[1:00:14] callings without repentance right
[1:00:16] this young man knew how to make money
[1:00:20] and i just believe it's a personal thing
[1:00:22] i just hold
[1:00:24] some men are born to be carpenters some
[1:00:26] born to think in
[1:00:27] the abstract realm of what we would call
[1:00:29] computers and whatever because you can't
[1:00:30] see what's happening in there
[1:00:32] that's why i call it abstract right amen
[1:00:35] just a little humor because when i said
[1:00:36] this
[1:00:37] i don't know months and months ago i
[1:00:38] didn't even realize what i said
[1:00:40] i said it was full of x's and o's and
[1:00:42] and that would be saying i love you i
[1:00:43] love you i love you and
[1:00:44] too bad our computer don't love us mine
[1:00:47] has an extreme dislike for me
[1:00:52] but once it knows and all this stuff
[1:00:54] that's abstract to me i don't understand
[1:00:56] how that even works but god gave this
[1:00:58] young man a
[1:00:59] ability to make money and if he'd just
[1:01:02] caught the revelation of what jesus
[1:01:04] jesus didn't tell him go back study your
[1:01:06] scripture jesus didn't tell him i want
[1:01:08] you to go over here and be
[1:01:10] poor like all the rest of them jesus
[1:01:12] said just sell it all
[1:01:15] and give it to the poor and this is just
[1:01:18] how paul sees the scripture i see this
[1:01:20] young man calling up his
[1:01:21] investment broker well you know what
[1:01:23] today i got some investment over here in
[1:01:26] uh
[1:01:26] microsoft and i i want you to just go
[1:01:29] sell
[1:01:29] all uh 300 000 shares that i have i'm
[1:01:33] gonna donate this money to
[1:01:35] help some people and the stock broker go
[1:01:37] okay i'll do that sir it don't really
[1:01:38] make sense
[1:01:39] but let me tell you sir that uh your
[1:01:42] investment in this over here
[1:01:44] uh just quadrupled today
[1:01:48] and he would not have been and the
[1:01:50] reason i believe this saints is the
[1:01:51] scripture says you can never
[1:01:52] out-give god so here he would have been
[1:01:55] going along to the poor
[1:01:57] look at this row of beautiful poor girls
[1:02:00] and i think that would be true probably
[1:02:01] between all of them
[1:02:03] i could spend every time they have in
[1:02:04] less than five minutes
[1:02:06] so technically they'd be considered poor
[1:02:11] but you see what god does he gives to us
[1:02:13] something greater
[1:02:15] than what we can do for ourselves and
[1:02:17] you can't out give
[1:02:18] god so when we start to give to god
[1:02:22] god comes intangible and intangible
[1:02:26] and starts to reward us because he says
[1:02:29] he's a rewarder of those who diligently
[1:02:31] seek him
[1:02:32] and if we're saying lord i want to know
[1:02:34] lord what you want me to do
[1:02:36] then we are diligently seeking the will
[1:02:38] of god and he'll come
[1:02:39] and reward us for that diligence and so
[1:02:42] here he is
[1:02:43] there there god got this situation he's
[1:02:46] looking across he knows who
[1:02:48] father abraham is and he recognizes
[1:02:51] lazarus as as that man and he says can
[1:02:54] he come and
[1:02:54] dip his finger and he says no this golf
[1:02:56] is too great
[1:02:57] it can't be crossed from your side or
[1:02:59] from our side he comes down and he says
[1:03:01] you know what i i need you to do
[1:03:03] i need you to send him back to my
[1:03:06] brothers because my brothers walked up
[1:03:08] my driveway many a time
[1:03:10] they know who he is and they know he
[1:03:12] died and though he come from the dead
[1:03:14] it surely would shake them the
[1:03:16] supernatural right
[1:03:18] surely the supernatural would shake my
[1:03:20] brothers because you see the problem is
[1:03:23] they're going down this same exact path
[1:03:25] i went down
[1:03:27] we were raised in church baptized were
[1:03:29] part of this might even a taught camp
[1:03:31] might even have taught sunday school
[1:03:32] might have been part of a church board
[1:03:34] might have been part of all kinds of
[1:03:36] things and everything looks like it's
[1:03:38] just fine
[1:03:39] it looks like we're going the right way
[1:03:41] we're in church we're not heathens
[1:03:46] but father abraham tells them you know
[1:03:48] what the one came from the dead
[1:03:51] it won't move them it won't move them
[1:03:55] why because they are so determined
[1:03:57] imagine lazarus shows up at their door
[1:03:59] and he knocks and they open the door and
[1:04:01] they're like whoa that's you lazarus
[1:04:05] yes your brother sent me he's in hell
[1:04:10] and he wants you guys to change your
[1:04:11] ways and they would have said this is an
[1:04:13] evil spirit
[1:04:14] our brother gave his life to church gave
[1:04:16] millions of dollars to the church
[1:04:18] he done this and he done this this is an
[1:04:21] evil spirit
[1:04:22] and we won't receive this we rebuke you
[1:04:28] why because the platform had already
[1:04:29] been laid if you won't now i'm going to
[1:04:31] change the wording of this just a little
[1:04:32] bit saints
[1:04:33] if you won't receive the word for your
[1:04:35] hour
[1:04:38] nothing's going to change your mind
[1:04:42] did you know that's not even a defense
[1:04:44] of this message
[1:04:46] many critics that say well you're just
[1:04:48] promoting what you believe no i'm sorry
[1:04:50] let's promote what the bible said let's
[1:04:52] promote what the bible
[1:04:54] said and they won't accept what the
[1:04:56] bible says
[1:04:59] come on saints
[1:05:04] and though something supernatural would
[1:05:05] take place right in their midst
[1:05:08] they still won't believe
[1:05:12] am i clear enough i'm trying to i
[1:05:15] preached
[1:05:16] terribly terribly long in phoenix
[1:05:19] so much so at the old brothers breakfast
[1:05:21] the next morning that brother ron took
[1:05:23] me to
[1:05:24] one of the old brothers patted me on the
[1:05:25] back and said brother paul
[1:05:27] you are now in second place amongst the
[1:05:29] longest preachers in our church
[1:05:32] that didn't help me at all
[1:05:39] in fact then that brought out they said
[1:05:41] brother ron tell them the story brother
[1:05:42] ron tell them the story and brother
[1:05:44] ron's like well okay i guess i can tell
[1:05:46] them story you want to hear the story
[1:05:47] sure brother on what's the story
[1:05:48] he's telling me about a brother i
[1:05:50] believe he's from africa and how the
[1:05:52] brother was up there around the four
[1:05:53] hour mark or something like that brother
[1:05:55] ron actually had to get up and tell him
[1:05:56] brother
[1:05:57] you're at the two-minute warning
[1:06:01] he preached another 20 minutes i was
[1:06:04] like oh
[1:06:05] my but another brother down the table at
[1:06:08] the breakfast said
[1:06:09] think of it this way brother paul you're
[1:06:10] in very exclusive company
[1:06:17] you see what happened here was this rich
[1:06:20] man
[1:06:22] in his life being raised up and all that
[1:06:25] had happened he had been persuaded to
[1:06:27] a belief now lest you would think that i
[1:06:30] am
[1:06:31] looking negatively at that we'll come
[1:06:33] along here in just a little bit and
[1:06:35] touch on the other side of this
[1:06:36] but my brother and sister young people
[1:06:38] please hear me this morning
[1:06:40] we can come to a place that my mama says
[1:06:42] this my daddy says this
[1:06:44] uh the sunday school teacher says this
[1:06:47] the ministry in our church says this and
[1:06:50] it makes sense
[1:06:51] i think i should do that i'm a young man
[1:06:54] i should keep myself clean i should be
[1:06:56] respectful
[1:06:57] my hair cut right i should behave
[1:06:59] correctly in the fashion of holiness a
[1:07:01] young sister
[1:07:02] you'd say okay i see the word of god
[1:07:04] says then i shouldn't cut my hair and i
[1:07:06] should dress modestly
[1:07:08] and i should present myself godly okay
[1:07:10] it makes sense to me
[1:07:11] and you do this my brother sister and
[1:07:14] this is what is called persuasion
[1:07:17] this is i'll read the full definition in
[1:07:20] a minute but this is where
[1:07:21] we're raised because human nature our
[1:07:24] children will often follow
[1:07:26] in our footsteps say man remember the
[1:07:28] story brother brown talks
[1:07:29] about the man delivering the christmas
[1:07:31] gifts and how he looks back and his
[1:07:32] little boy is staggering through the
[1:07:34] snow
[1:07:35] and he finally says son why are you
[1:07:37] walking that way he says daddy i want to
[1:07:39] follow in your footsteps
[1:07:40] you see we're going to come to a place
[1:07:42] we'll do that but if we're not careful
[1:07:44] we can be here in the church
[1:07:46] we can be raised up or introduced to the
[1:07:48] message and we do that and we follow by
[1:07:50] a persuasion
[1:07:51] because our mind can wrap itself around
[1:07:54] the idea
[1:07:55] that this is what we should do but my
[1:07:57] brother and sister when we break free
[1:07:59] from the persuasion and we step out into
[1:08:01] what i would call the real world
[1:08:03] there's all kinds of persuasion all
[1:08:05] kinds of voices all kinds of things that
[1:08:07] say that's nonsense
[1:08:08] and so persuasion will only last for a
[1:08:12] season
[1:08:13] you can come you can come in these
[1:08:14] meetings you can come in church you can
[1:08:16] do this you can do that
[1:08:18] and people are stirred and they walk out
[1:08:20] with a resolution it's kind of like new
[1:08:22] year's resolutions coming along here
[1:08:24] in just a few days my brother and sister
[1:08:26] i don't even really believe in them
[1:08:28] because oftentimes we're just persuaded
[1:08:30] i need to do this and i need to do that
[1:08:33] but it's not conviction
[1:08:35] it is just something that you and the
[1:08:37] doctor says i need to lose some weight
[1:08:38] so right after the new year
[1:08:42] why not right now
[1:08:46] i was preaching to paul and jerry there
[1:08:48] amen
[1:08:51] you see persuasion will carry us
[1:08:56] for so long but it will not carry us all
[1:08:58] the way through
[1:09:00] in fact you'd be persuaded to a belief
[1:09:04] brother branham said now let me just
[1:09:05] draw this out
[1:09:07] i'm just paraphrasing this brother brown
[1:09:09] says we're getting them to church
[1:09:11] not to christ he said i'm afraid of that
[1:09:16] young people i don't want to get you to
[1:09:17] church i want to get you to christ
[1:09:20] i want you to get out of the idea of mom
[1:09:23] and dad such a strict life this that and
[1:09:25] the other
[1:09:25] i want you to get into the idea that
[1:09:28] this uh
[1:09:28] story of the rich man and lazarus is not
[1:09:31] just something that's in the bible
[1:09:34] it is going to be and is being played
[1:09:37] out
[1:09:37] each and every day of this life
[1:09:40] of this world we live in people are
[1:09:43] going to the grave
[1:09:44] thinking it's okay the prophet of god
[1:09:47] shares a story about that girl
[1:09:49] and she's been a sunday school teacher
[1:09:51] and all these things she's dying there
[1:09:53] of a disease
[1:09:54] and it's there as she is passing from
[1:09:56] this life into the next
[1:09:57] she turns to her pastor and starts
[1:10:00] yelling at him or whatever
[1:10:02] loudly speaking you deceiver you
[1:10:04] deceiver i
[1:10:05] am lost
[1:10:09] i'm not here to play on your emotion i'm
[1:10:11] here to play on reality
[1:10:14] that just because we're sitting in grace
[1:10:15] tabernacle doesn't mean
[1:10:17] that we have some kind of go pass go
[1:10:20] collect 200
[1:10:21] we've got to have a real live experience
[1:10:24] with jesus christ
[1:10:25] we've got to get beyond churchianity our
[1:10:28] family
[1:10:29] grandma and grandpa all this and that
[1:10:31] they're all believers well i won't do
[1:10:33] one thing for you
[1:10:35] hallelujah you might know who father
[1:10:37] abraham is you might know
[1:10:39] all of these things but it's got to go
[1:10:41] beyond persuasion and become conviction
[1:10:44] it's going to move into the place that
[1:10:46] deep down in your heart
[1:10:48] nothing can shake you from that brother
[1:10:51] branham says here now in the sermon
[1:10:53] proof of his resurrection
[1:10:54] he said it's not christ on the outside
[1:10:57] reading it saying yes that's right
[1:11:01] but christ on the inside saying that's
[1:11:04] right
[1:11:05] you get the difference christ on the
[1:11:08] inside amen conforming
[1:11:12] you know often times
[1:11:15] young people i don't even like to really
[1:11:16] speak about this too much but
[1:11:18] i just can't help it as a young man i
[1:11:21] did a lot of conforming
[1:11:23] but it was not conviction and when
[1:11:27] something else come along that persuaded
[1:11:28] me differently
[1:11:30] i went with that and it took me on a
[1:11:33] 20-year
[1:11:34] journey outside i believe of the will of
[1:11:37] god
[1:11:38] outside of the word a 20-year journey
[1:11:41] because i thought hey we believe
[1:11:45] god sent a prophet everything will be
[1:11:48] all right
[1:11:49] that's good but the devil believes god
[1:11:52] sent a prophet
[1:11:54] he's not saved amen he's not god eternal
[1:11:58] life
[1:12:01] now i want to share these words with you
[1:12:05] because you see saints church
[1:12:09] what i'm speaking of can happen right
[1:12:11] here
[1:12:14] we can hear the ministry of this church
[1:12:17] visiting ministry
[1:12:19] week after week year after year we can
[1:12:21] and it not
[1:12:22] change us come on saints can you hear me
[1:12:26] can you hear me amen now look here i
[1:12:29] want to share with you
[1:12:30] uh this amen we can be persuaded
[1:12:37] but not revelated that's right amen
[1:12:39] that's right
[1:12:41] yes sir am i preaching too blunt today
[1:12:46] i want to see each and every one of us
[1:12:48] i'm preaching to paul this morning
[1:12:50] i want to see each and every one of us
[1:12:51] in the rapture that ought to make us
[1:12:53] happy
[1:12:54] amen i i'm not here just to make you
[1:12:56] feel good to go home we have such a
[1:12:58] lovely church they preach such nice
[1:13:00] sermons well do you bit of good if you
[1:13:02] end up on the wrong side of this golf
[1:13:08] amen now let me just read uh
[1:13:14] i'm kind of lost in my own notes isn't
[1:13:15] that silly
[1:13:18] i guess we're just not there yet
[1:13:25] we can be persuaded but not revelated
[1:13:29] but you see what we need is conviction
[1:13:32] which is a
[1:13:32] firmly held belief
[1:13:36] now see there's a lot of difference
[1:13:37] between conviction and condemnation
[1:13:40] we can preach down here amen young
[1:13:42] people
[1:13:43] well i guess sister nadia is a young
[1:13:45] person today she's right on the same
[1:13:46] seat and i'm not going to
[1:13:47] solve the end of the pew of young people
[1:13:51] we can hold
[1:13:55] things in our life we can deal with
[1:13:58] things in our life
[1:14:00] and we can feel condemned that's right
[1:14:03] i lied to mom and dad
[1:14:07] i'm sorry down paul
[1:14:12] anybody ever lie to their parents yes
[1:14:14] sir
[1:14:17] yeah i hope all of you that said yes sir
[1:14:20] said i've also repented
[1:14:21] [Laughter]
[1:14:23] but you see we can we can be condemned
[1:14:27] we can kind of put the gray area
[1:14:30] reminds me a little story of boys at his
[1:14:32] grandmother's house and
[1:14:34] grandma's in the room sewing and he
[1:14:36] hears the buzz of the sewing machine
[1:14:40] and so he goes so carefully
[1:14:43] and he's over there and he's just
[1:14:45] lifting the lid off the cookie jar
[1:14:48] and his grandma says bobby are you in
[1:14:51] the cookies
[1:14:54] no grandma i was just looking
[1:14:57] at them
[1:15:05] we can be condemned for what we speak
[1:15:07] what we say what we do
[1:15:10] but you realize this struck me this
[1:15:13] something just come to me down there in
[1:15:14] phoenix and
[1:15:15] and i i it stirred my heart you realize
[1:15:18] saints when the devil comes and says hey
[1:15:20] you did this you did this you did this
[1:15:23] you did this young people you did this
[1:15:26] do you realize if you've repented all
[1:15:29] the devil
[1:15:30] has is a xerox copy of your sin
[1:15:34] he doesn't have your sin your sin is
[1:15:37] under the blood
[1:15:38] all he's got
[1:15:41] is a xerox coffee that says you did this
[1:15:44] and you did this you did this
[1:15:45] but because he refuses to accept the
[1:15:47] blood of jesus christ
[1:15:49] his page will never be wiped away he'll
[1:15:51] have it forever to wave in front of you
[1:15:53] you did this and you can say i sure did
[1:15:56] devil
[1:15:56] but it's no longer held to my account
[1:16:00] because it's been washed by the blood of
[1:16:03] what is that my brother and sister you
[1:16:04] don't have to be condemned
[1:16:06] because you had conviction that caused
[1:16:08] you to do something about
[1:16:09] your sin and therefore we have reacted
[1:16:12] and said lord wash away my sin forgive
[1:16:14] me lord i'm putting it under the blood
[1:16:16] and the devil can wave that list just as
[1:16:18] much as he wants
[1:16:19] you don't have to be condemned by that
[1:16:21] spirit you can stand up and say praise
[1:16:23] lord
[1:16:24] neville i did that now most of us have
[1:16:26] done things in our life
[1:16:28] we would not stand up in church and say
[1:16:29] well guess what i did
[1:16:32] but i tell you my brother and sister you
[1:16:34] no longer have to be ashamed of that
[1:16:36] because you can say i know satan truly
[1:16:38] you have that copy of what i have done
[1:16:41] but truly you missed the point that the
[1:16:43] blood of jesus christ
[1:16:45] has washed that away has nullified it
[1:16:49] amen i am convicted i repent when i do
[1:16:53] wrong
[1:16:53] but i am no longer condemned
[1:16:58] but if we're not careful we'll take
[1:16:59] condemnation it's the same for
[1:17:01] conviction i
[1:17:02] felt so bad about that that's like the
[1:17:04] liar cheating thief
[1:17:05] that repents after he's caught
[1:17:08] is it true repentance no because if he
[1:17:11] never been caught he would have never
[1:17:12] repented
[1:17:14] come on amen he knows
[1:17:18] the rich man knows that his brothers are
[1:17:20] traveling down this pathway
[1:17:23] now let's look at persuade for a second
[1:17:26] persuade to cause
[1:17:27] someone to do something by asking
[1:17:30] arguing or giving reasons
[1:17:34] come on we can as a church
[1:17:37] give all kinds of reasons why not
[1:17:41] to call someone to believe something
[1:17:44] as a transitive verb it would come more
[1:17:47] of an action
[1:17:48] to move by an argument in treaty
[1:17:51] or expostulation to a belief
[1:17:54] position or course of action to plead
[1:17:57] with
[1:17:59] urge
[1:18:02] i think my brother and sister that every
[1:18:04] preacher that ever stands in a pulpit
[1:18:06] is here to persuade you
[1:18:13] yeah are they always convicted
[1:18:18] no no no sir
[1:18:22] you see he says i've got these brothers
[1:18:24] that are going down the same exact
[1:18:25] pathway
[1:18:26] we thought we were going to heaven uh
[1:18:27] let you come and
[1:18:29] uh deal with them but abraham says you
[1:18:32] know what they have moses they have the
[1:18:33] prophets
[1:18:34] now i'm for the sake of our conversation
[1:18:36] today i'm going to put it this way
[1:18:38] they have moses and they have a prophet
[1:18:41] let them hear them let them listen to
[1:18:44] the prophet
[1:18:45] they don't need a candy-coated uh uh uh
[1:18:48] orientation
[1:18:49] from from me they don't need it from you
[1:18:51] they don't need it from some preacher
[1:18:52] let them listen to the prophet
[1:18:54] just take the word for your hour and
[1:18:57] listen to it
[1:18:58] and if that won't move you nothing will
[1:19:01] oh but my pastor is so eloquent with
[1:19:03] words good
[1:19:04] good candy coat you candy coach you walk
[1:19:08] out of church our pastor just preached
[1:19:09] such an amazing sermon
[1:19:11] what did it do to your life
[1:19:16] you know spurgeon said if a preacher i'm
[1:19:18] just paraphrasing it said if the
[1:19:19] preacher
[1:19:19] didn't make you mad during church he
[1:19:21] didn't do his job
[1:19:25] can i take that as a license
[1:19:27] [Music]
[1:19:29] think about what he's saying though he's
[1:19:32] not talking about mad in the human
[1:19:34] element of anger
[1:19:35] but the mad would be pointed back to our
[1:19:37] own self
[1:19:38] why did i let the devil do that to me
[1:19:40] why did i let the devil trick me
[1:19:42] why did i let the devil influence in me
[1:19:44] that way
[1:19:45] you see if the preacher isn't doing that
[1:19:47] my brother and sister he's not doing his
[1:19:49] job
[1:19:49] but you know in the world we live in
[1:19:51] even around this message everybody's
[1:19:52] moving towards these nice candy coated
[1:19:55] ma i know i don't know who gave us the
[1:19:57] gift but somebody gave us these uh candy
[1:20:00] coated almonds
[1:20:03] who did that oh good it's family
[1:20:07] i can really lean on them for a whole
[1:20:08] bucket full of them
[1:20:11] i don't want a little cup full i want a
[1:20:14] bucket full of those things
[1:20:16] my blood sugar will probably kill me my
[1:20:18] head will pop off and i'll be done but
[1:20:20] at least i'd die happy
[1:20:24] but you see if we take that to the
[1:20:25] message and we start candy-coating this
[1:20:27] message
[1:20:28] oh praise the lord we can pack the
[1:20:30] church out
[1:20:31] we're going to have to build a new
[1:20:32] church our church is so full because our
[1:20:34] pastor speaks
[1:20:35] so wonderfully and then we look over and
[1:20:42] hey how did i get here
[1:20:46] [Music]
[1:20:48] it'd be the same if i just ate a bucket
[1:20:50] full of sister kristen's
[1:20:51] candy coated almonds
[1:20:55] i don't know if any of the rest of you
[1:20:57] got any of those but if you did
[1:20:59] let's join together and force her to
[1:21:00] make more
[1:21:03] but our preaching shouldn't be that way
[1:21:05] our preaching needs to cut right to the
[1:21:07] core of our heart our life
[1:21:08] it needs to bring us to the place we
[1:21:09] recognize i don't want to end up with
[1:21:11] that rich man
[1:21:12] i want to be over here and be aligned
[1:21:14] with lazarus the beggar
[1:21:15] i want to know because you see lazarus
[1:21:17] laying there on the curb
[1:21:20] he was laying there with sores on his
[1:21:22] body and malnutrition
[1:21:24] but he had revelation of who he was in
[1:21:27] jesus christ
[1:21:28] and while it looked like that he had
[1:21:30] been given absolutely the short end of
[1:21:31] the stick
[1:21:32] in this life he was there with a
[1:21:34] relationship with god
[1:21:36] and you think but if god loved him yeah
[1:21:39] god loved him so much
[1:21:40] he let him suffer in the flesh to redeem
[1:21:43] his soul
[1:21:44] i say god maybe some of us need to
[1:21:46] suffer a little bit
[1:21:47] and get over our candy-coated life that
[1:21:50] we have our
[1:21:51] candy-coated church candy-coated
[1:21:53] everything that we could come to a place
[1:21:55] lord i'm willing beyond everything to
[1:21:57] have this relationship with you lord
[1:21:59] to be filled with your spirit i'm a
[1:22:02] revelation of who i
[1:22:03] am in jesus christ that is more than a
[1:22:05] million dollars that is more than 10
[1:22:07] million dollars
[1:22:08] that is more than a life of sumptuous
[1:22:10] living
[1:22:13] but if we're not careful we want to try
[1:22:16] and find the balance can i find the
[1:22:18] balance lord a little sumptuous living
[1:22:20] and maybe i could have a revelation also
[1:22:22] choose
[1:22:24] if you have a revelation of jesus christ
[1:22:26] and you sell out to him and he gives you
[1:22:28] those gifts of life those good things a
[1:22:30] good job
[1:22:31] a home all of this you all praise the
[1:22:33] lord for that
[1:22:34] but he says that you should seek ye
[1:22:36] first the kingdom
[1:22:38] very clearly shows us where our priority
[1:22:40] ought to be
[1:22:42] now samuel butler i doubt if too many of
[1:22:45] you have heard of samuel butler
[1:22:47] but some of you will have recognized
[1:22:49] this phrase
[1:22:50] amen he wrote this back in the 17th
[1:22:53] century
[1:22:55] he that complies against his will
[1:22:58] is of his own opinion still
[1:23:03] i want you to think about that well
[1:23:08] our pastor our youth leader they're
[1:23:10] always telling us this is how we're
[1:23:12] supposed to dress this is how we're
[1:23:13] supposed to act
[1:23:14] this is what we're supposed to do i've
[1:23:16] done it
[1:23:20] come on young people it's not just your
[1:23:23] battle but it's a hard battle when
[1:23:25] you're young
[1:23:26] mom says dad says pastor says
[1:23:29] look but if you comply and something
[1:23:32] down inside of you says i don't want to
[1:23:33] do this but i have to
[1:23:36] you're still of your own opinion
[1:23:41] young people i don't want to skin you
[1:23:42] too hard so i'll move on to your parents
[1:23:44] here so they can heal with you
[1:23:47] my brother and sister you can look
[1:23:48] through the pictures of the days
[1:23:50] you can look through these things of the
[1:23:52] ages you can go back through photo
[1:23:54] albums and there'll be
[1:23:55] gatherings there'll be groups there'll
[1:23:57] be people and you will see that they
[1:23:59] must maybe sit at your table
[1:24:01] and you look at those pictures where are
[1:24:03] they today
[1:24:05] not serving god today you know what they
[1:24:08] were doing
[1:24:09] they were complying they were complying
[1:24:12] they were
[1:24:13] submitting to that but it was not
[1:24:15] revelation to them
[1:24:17] because when god becomes revelation to
[1:24:20] you
[1:24:20] you can't quit you cannot say well i'm
[1:24:24] done serving god
[1:24:26] and ever have had a true revelation
[1:24:29] you are persuaded and so in that
[1:24:32] persuasion something else the cares of
[1:24:34] life
[1:24:35] someone's voice whatever it might be has
[1:24:37] persuaded you differently
[1:24:40] oh god help us to move beyond persuasion
[1:24:43] to come into the realm that this is
[1:24:45] revelation
[1:24:47] hallelujah oh my my brother and sister
[1:24:50] strong words
[1:24:52] strong words you see as we go back to
[1:24:55] verse 31 it was
[1:24:57] there that it's like you know what if
[1:24:58] they hear not moses and the prophets
[1:25:00] neither will they be persuaded
[1:25:02] though one rose from the dead it will
[1:25:05] not matter what kind of supernatural
[1:25:07] event took place
[1:25:08] if they don't have something beyond
[1:25:12] that's right nothing inside
[1:25:17] reaching out taking the halts of the
[1:25:19] word
[1:25:22] come on are you with me saints i might
[1:25:25] be skinning some of you a little bit i
[1:25:26] don't know
[1:25:27] but i just felt compelled i have to
[1:25:29] preach this
[1:25:31] hallelujah you see it's got to come down
[1:25:34] because you see if you're entertaining
[1:25:35] the idea of quitting god
[1:25:40] he will give you plenty of reasons
[1:25:42] reason i'm not going to serve god
[1:25:45] is our pastor sometimes just preaches
[1:25:48] too hard
[1:25:50] and they did this and they did that and
[1:25:52] he was preaching about something and i'm
[1:25:54] sure he meant that
[1:25:55] at me well you know what
[1:25:59] i'm not speaking in defense of the
[1:26:01] preachers around this church
[1:26:03] but what if it wasn't them at all what
[1:26:06] if that was god speaking
[1:26:08] to you what if it was god telling you
[1:26:10] young men young women
[1:26:12] don't go out there in the world don't
[1:26:13] act like you're a christian and go out
[1:26:15] here in the world and go over here and
[1:26:18] do this look my brother and sister when
[1:26:19] you got and i'm not speaking against the
[1:26:21] sisters
[1:26:22] young sisters but when you have cases
[1:26:24] where my friends different pastors share
[1:26:26] my we got blown away
[1:26:27] found out one of these young ladies in
[1:26:28] the church she's just been so sweet so
[1:26:30] loving so whatever
[1:26:31] but she's got a boyfriend and she goes
[1:26:33] out and drinks and smokes with him
[1:26:34] it floored us what was that
[1:26:40] persuasion with no conviction
[1:26:46] now by god's grace that particular
[1:26:47] little girl gave her heart back to god
[1:26:49] realized she'd done wrong
[1:26:52] that's right shall i give you all the
[1:26:55] details shall i blow you away
[1:26:58] okay my wife says no i'll follow her
[1:27:01] because i'm telling you this wasn't just
[1:27:03] some simple little oh i better not do
[1:27:05] this i'm a bad girl
[1:27:06] she had a drastic thing happen in her
[1:27:09] life
[1:27:10] and she realized that
[1:27:14] this out here that was so beautiful
[1:27:15] outside these walls
[1:27:17] is not beautiful at all reminds me
[1:27:20] brother gideon routine took sister jerry
[1:27:22] and i a few years ago when we were there
[1:27:24] for youth camp
[1:27:25] took us out to kruger national park and
[1:27:27] i got all
[1:27:28] excited there was uh what was that thing
[1:27:31] jerry was that a
[1:27:32] baboon or whatever it was remember when
[1:27:34] i jumped out of the van
[1:27:36] brother get in screamed at me get back
[1:27:39] in the van i'm sorry brother get in
[1:27:43] he goes you don't understand brother
[1:27:44] paul death
[1:27:47] strikes quickly out there
[1:27:51] then proceeded to tell us about how
[1:27:53] baboons this guy got out and take a
[1:27:55] picture of these baby baboons
[1:27:57] and my i shouldn't even tell you about
[1:27:58] this but mama baboon took offense to
[1:28:01] that and tore the man's head off
[1:28:02] literally
[1:28:04] death strikes quickly out there don't
[1:28:06] get out of the van
[1:28:09] but see that can't be just your pastor
[1:28:11] speaking that's going to be conviction
[1:28:13] it's going to be something down in your
[1:28:14] heart that knows he is
[1:28:16] our sanctuary he is our refuge
[1:28:21] it's not what we know what we can do how
[1:28:23] much money in the bank
[1:28:24] because most of us would be in trouble
[1:28:26] there but look at this my brother and
[1:28:28] sister
[1:28:28] if we don't it becomes
[1:28:31] that knowledge
[1:28:34] it becomes intellectual do you realize
[1:28:38] an intellectual
[1:28:39] revelation is just satan's distraction
[1:28:42] we can go for years saying yes uh now
[1:28:44] brother branham preached this and he
[1:28:46] preached this like this and he tied this
[1:28:47] over here like this
[1:28:48] and we see how he come right here and he
[1:28:50] said this and he said that
[1:28:53] what is it those are the same people
[1:28:56] that can
[1:28:57] explain trigonometry to you
[1:29:01] they're the same one that can explain to
[1:29:03] you uh all of
[1:29:05] all of these concepts
[1:29:09] it doesn't make a revelation does it
[1:29:12] you know what intellectual revelation
[1:29:14] does
[1:29:16] it leads us don't frown at me church
[1:29:22] lip service intellectual revelation
[1:29:27] leads to lip service amen that's right
[1:29:30] well praise the lord praise the lord
[1:29:35] no you know what i'd rather i'd rather
[1:29:36] you be silent
[1:29:38] i'd even settle for your frowning at me
[1:29:40] amen
[1:29:41] if it's here if it's down here my
[1:29:44] brother and sister
[1:29:46] amen amen well i'll hurry along here so
[1:29:49] that you uh
[1:29:51] you don't have to listen to part two on
[1:29:53] this
[1:29:54] amen now first corinthians 1 21
[1:29:59] uh is talking about it please god by the
[1:30:01] foolishness of preaching to save them
[1:30:03] that belief
[1:30:04] amen i'm glad god you know put that in
[1:30:07] scripture because sometimes we feel
[1:30:08] pretty foolish after we've preached
[1:30:10] you see everyone comes to a time of
[1:30:12] persuasion and it has different effects
[1:30:14] on different people
[1:30:16] amen we react saints according to the
[1:30:19] atmosphere
[1:30:22] that we approached it in right that's
[1:30:24] right
[1:30:25] well our family goes to church we're
[1:30:27] message believers
[1:30:29] you'll get just exactly what you
[1:30:32] approached it in
[1:30:34] if we come to church just because we are
[1:30:36] message
[1:30:37] believers message family so therefore we
[1:30:40] go to church
[1:30:41] that's all you're going to get out of it
[1:30:42] the satisfaction that i went to church i
[1:30:45] took my children to church
[1:30:47] you know we as a family said in church
[1:30:49] together this
[1:30:50] is what happened to the rich young ruler
[1:30:53] to this rich man
[1:30:56] they went to church to become a
[1:30:58] formality almost as though they could
[1:30:59] look down the checklist
[1:31:00] and check that off we prayed over our
[1:31:03] food check oh we prayed for the
[1:31:05] people that needed check we went to
[1:31:07] church check
[1:31:09] well do one more thing for us my brother
[1:31:10] and sister then become
[1:31:12] something to check off but we've got to
[1:31:15] come down to
[1:31:16] this place that we recognize what god is
[1:31:18] doing
[1:31:19] is giving us the opportunity to create
[1:31:21] the atmosphere
[1:31:22] by which we can come into the house of
[1:31:25] god
[1:31:25] this morning and say lord i need you to
[1:31:29] speak to me
[1:31:30] i need my battery amen does any of you
[1:31:32] ever ever get down to sunday and your
[1:31:34] battery's kind of like
[1:31:37] come on praise god mine's usually that
[1:31:41] way by wednesday
[1:31:46] hallelujah i'll just tell you the truth
[1:31:49] i believe in living life to the fullest
[1:31:50] and
[1:31:51] you know that takes that takes a lot you
[1:31:53] know it's like i met a guy
[1:31:55] it's funny how we got in this
[1:31:56] conversation because we're sitting there
[1:31:58] at this older brother's breakfast and
[1:31:59] this brother pulls out this flip phone
[1:32:01] he goes can you guess how old this is
[1:32:06] and i said i don't know but i was about
[1:32:08] 26 when i had one of those
[1:32:11] and he goes yep that'd be about right he
[1:32:14] knew how
[1:32:15] this is a 30 year old phone still works
[1:32:18] i said what do you use it for brothers
[1:32:20] what do you use a telephone for
[1:32:27] i said okay i understand that
[1:32:30] he goes but i don't have to worry about
[1:32:32] wearing it out there's days go by it
[1:32:34] never rings
[1:32:39] that thing's probably going to last till
[1:32:40] the rapture
[1:32:42] but you know i've got a phone amen well
[1:32:45] sister jerry convinced me my daughter
[1:32:47] kristen convinced me to get a different
[1:32:48] phone here recently
[1:32:50] but i've got a phone that's got like
[1:32:52] three or four thousand photos on it
[1:32:54] it's got several thousand notes in the
[1:32:56] notes
[1:32:57] it's got almost zero memory left
[1:33:01] because you see i'm going to use this
[1:33:02] phone for what it was made for
[1:33:05] it was made to be my memory
[1:33:11] yeah it was
[1:33:14] my mailbox it was my phone drop
[1:33:17] it was my photo album i tell you what
[1:33:21] i hope you don't mind a little humor
[1:33:22] this morning but there's nothing more i
[1:33:24] realize this while we're in arizona
[1:33:26] we're in a conversation i said oh
[1:33:27] brothers i want to show you this photo
[1:33:29] conversation goes on and it's long gone
[1:33:31] when i'm finally like
[1:33:32] and i realize no one's interested
[1:33:38] because no one wanted to wait while i
[1:33:39] went through 4 000 pages of
[1:33:42] photo album you see my brother and
[1:33:45] sister
[1:33:46] we come to a place let me get back on
[1:33:48] track here
[1:33:49] come to a place that we're going to
[1:33:50] react according to the atmosphere
[1:33:53] that we approached it with amen if we
[1:33:57] approach this with an atmosphere i go to
[1:33:59] church
[1:33:59] you'll get just exactly that you can be
[1:34:01] able to say i
[1:34:03] went to church now i'm going to come
[1:34:04] here because i'm closing in the next
[1:34:06] couple minutes amen
[1:34:08] romans 8 we won't go through all of
[1:34:10] these scriptures but we will
[1:34:12] see right here as paul is speaking to
[1:34:14] the romans i want to jump right down i
[1:34:16] want to make commentation commentary on
[1:34:18] the others i want to jump right down to
[1:34:20] verse 38
[1:34:21] amen and so as we'll look at this on
[1:34:24] verse 38 brother alex if you'll pop that
[1:34:26] up there uh for
[1:34:28] he now paul is speaking to the romans
[1:34:31] and he tells them for i am persuaded but
[1:34:34] my brother and sister do you understand
[1:34:36] that persuasion with revelation
[1:34:38] yields an entirely different result so
[1:34:41] paul is there telling them
[1:34:42] i'm persuaded but he's got revelation to
[1:34:45] back
[1:34:46] up the persuasion he's not just there
[1:34:48] well
[1:34:49] somebody convinced me that somebody who
[1:34:51] convinced him
[1:34:52] was almighty god jehovah el shaddai
[1:34:56] on the backside of the desert and there
[1:34:58] he walked out
[1:34:59] fully persuaded it wasn't well according
[1:35:02] to this and according to that i'm
[1:35:04] persuaded but it was that experience
[1:35:06] with almighty god
[1:35:07] and look what he says for i am persuaded
[1:35:10] that neither death
[1:35:13] oh my brother and sister we say i'm not
[1:35:15] afraid to die until the
[1:35:16] time comes nor life
[1:35:20] you know some of us are actually the way
[1:35:22] we live we're afraid of life
[1:35:25] come on i don't have time to deviate off
[1:35:27] into that
[1:35:28] but that's why i tell you young people
[1:35:30] live life to the fullest
[1:35:31] put god first live life to the fullest
[1:35:33] because some people are so
[1:35:35] afraid of life that they are afraid of
[1:35:38] making a mistake
[1:35:39] i'm not condoning we just go haphazardly
[1:35:41] through life but i'm telling you my
[1:35:42] brother and sister you live life to the
[1:35:44] fullest
[1:35:45] and if you make a mistake the holy ghost
[1:35:48] will come down brother branham preaches
[1:35:50] on this
[1:35:50] the holy ghost will come down and deal
[1:35:52] with you
[1:35:53] and brother branham says when the holy
[1:35:55] spirit starts to deal with you repent
[1:35:56] quickly
[1:35:59] but some people don't even live life
[1:36:00] because they're afraid of making a
[1:36:02] mistake
[1:36:04] nor angels nor principalities nor powers
[1:36:07] nor things present
[1:36:08] nor things to come nor height nor depth
[1:36:11] nor any other creature
[1:36:12] shall be able to separate look at this
[1:36:15] revelation
[1:36:16] there's nothing going to separate me
[1:36:19] from the love of god which is in christ
[1:36:21] jesus our lord nothing is going to
[1:36:24] separate that
[1:36:25] that my brother and sister is a deep
[1:36:28] revelation
[1:36:28] that there's no mistake as it were no
[1:36:31] problem no deal in this life
[1:36:33] is going to bring me from the love of
[1:36:35] god then you can live life to the
[1:36:37] fullest
[1:36:38] hallelujah that's not the intentional
[1:36:41] sinning
[1:36:41] that's not the intentional going out
[1:36:43] from underneath the covering of the word
[1:36:44] but that's getting up in the morning and
[1:36:46] saying praise god
[1:36:48] god give me another day to live i'll
[1:36:50] live it for him
[1:36:51] and you go with gosto
[1:36:55] hallelujah there's a revelation there
[1:36:59] amen he was persuaded why because he had
[1:37:02] a revelation of who he was
[1:37:04] amen and this word has come in this hour
[1:37:06] my brother and sister
[1:37:08] and people study this word and they say
[1:37:10] well brother adam taught this and the
[1:37:11] bible says this
[1:37:12] and this is this but my brother and
[1:37:14] sister the prophet of god now i'm just
[1:37:16] paraphrasing the words here the prophet
[1:37:18] of god says
[1:37:19] it's revelation that seals this in your
[1:37:22] soul
[1:37:23] it is not that you can say well over in
[1:37:25] this sermon in paragraph whatever
[1:37:27] brother brown said this and over here
[1:37:28] brother brown said this
[1:37:29] and over here brother brown said that
[1:37:31] you can quote it all you want but if you
[1:37:33] can't live it
[1:37:36] amen we've got to come to the place it's
[1:37:38] real enough that we can live it
[1:37:40] hallelujah any of you make a mistake
[1:37:43] this last week
[1:37:45] hallelujah i've got a list as long as my
[1:37:48] arm of the mistakes i made this last
[1:37:50] week but i'll tell you the list is as
[1:37:52] long as my arm
[1:37:53] of the things i repented of this last
[1:37:55] week is it going to bind me
[1:37:57] hinder me do i look at myself you're no
[1:37:59] good paul as a christian
[1:38:01] you're not good as a pastor you're not
[1:38:02] good as a preacher no
[1:38:04] all of that is behind me because i have
[1:38:06] a revelation
[1:38:07] of who i am in jesus christ and i'm not
[1:38:11] just persuaded
[1:38:12] because i can read the message and read
[1:38:14] the bible
[1:38:15] i'm persuaded because something happened
[1:38:18] in me
[1:38:19] and i say well i can't really explain it
[1:38:22] because i don't really know what
[1:38:24] happened to its
[1:38:24] instagram but i can tell you that i am
[1:38:27] no longer condemned
[1:38:29] amen the devil come along say well you
[1:38:31] said this way and that could have been
[1:38:32] misunderstood
[1:38:33] and if it was misunderstood that way you
[1:38:35] lied to them and i can stop and say lord
[1:38:38] please just send your spirit that they
[1:38:40] understand it correctly
[1:38:42] because i never meant to lie to them and
[1:38:45] so satan you're rebuked
[1:38:47] and go forward and then you get a run
[1:38:50] into by the grace of god just a couple
[1:38:52] days later you're going to run into that
[1:38:53] individual
[1:38:54] and you say hey now i told you this and
[1:38:56] this and i don't want you to
[1:38:57] misunderstand because it could oh no i
[1:38:59] understood you
[1:39:01] amen well where was the devil at in this
[1:39:06] he was wanting you to go all the way
[1:39:07] through the week and show up at church
[1:39:09] on sunday i'm a liar
[1:39:11] i'm a liar i'm a liar i'm a liar
[1:39:15] live life to the fullest amen don't be
[1:39:18] afraid to pick up a telephone and sell
[1:39:19] somebody i said this and
[1:39:21] i don't know if that came out right
[1:39:22] exactly right you know what they'll do
[1:39:25] remember brother branham i'm gonna close
[1:39:26] saints remember brother branham
[1:39:29] the whole tax issue he's overwhelmed
[1:39:32] they're putting so much pressure on him
[1:39:35] and he's there you can find it spread
[1:39:38] across many sermons there
[1:39:40] he's talking he doesn't directly speak
[1:39:42] it out but he's talking about there i
[1:39:43] was in the woods so grieved in my spirit
[1:39:47] you can tie that right back my brother
[1:39:48] and sister those things the devil just
[1:39:51] used that and started pounding on him
[1:39:54] and then the prophet of god under such
[1:39:55] pressure the phone rings
[1:40:01] tell them i'm not here
[1:40:04] wait that can't be a prophet of god that
[1:40:06] would do that
[1:40:08] really
[1:40:12] steps outside
[1:40:16] god pats him on the back and says it's
[1:40:18] all right
[1:40:21] says i'm not going to move on your
[1:40:24] prayers
[1:40:25] i'm not going to speak to you until you
[1:40:28] correct this amen so brother branham
[1:40:31] that's my words that's my way of putting
[1:40:33] it
[1:40:33] brother branham goes back to this man
[1:40:36] and he tells them
[1:40:37] i caused my wife to lie to you
[1:40:42] now if you study the tapes now just
[1:40:45] think about
[1:40:46] paul how he approaches things sometimes
[1:40:52] then the man talking to brother brown
[1:40:54] says why you load down
[1:40:55] no good scoundrel i will never have
[1:40:58] nothing to do with you i would no you
[1:41:00] know you're just worthless
[1:41:02] no sir what's he do he says that calls
[1:41:05] me
[1:41:06] all the more to respect you
[1:41:10] the devil would say oh you're gonna look
[1:41:12] so foolish
[1:41:14] everybody's gonna no no
[1:41:18] no regardless of how we look if we're
[1:41:21] just persuaded we'll react one way
[1:41:24] but if we're persuaded we have a
[1:41:25] revelation we'll act entirely different
[1:41:28] and i don't care if they do look down on
[1:41:30] me i have to make it right
[1:41:32] for me amen
[1:41:36] but even out here amongst the heathen i
[1:41:38] know because i've had to do it saints
[1:41:40] i said things in such a way that we
[1:41:42] might call it you know gray
[1:41:45] now i know none of you have ever done
[1:41:46] that but let me explain to you what gray
[1:41:48] is
[1:41:48] it's 98 percent truth
[1:41:52] with two parts black come on let's get
[1:41:55] it right
[1:41:57] it's two parts black that yields gray
[1:42:00] that's it you don't have to have 98
[1:42:04] black and two parts white that won't
[1:42:05] work
[1:42:07] it's almost all white with just two
[1:42:10] parts of black
[1:42:12] yields gray and that's what the devil
[1:42:15] wants to do he wants to come in and
[1:42:17] inject that two parts black
[1:42:19] so we're not telling the truth i don't
[1:42:20] care how you view a gray
[1:42:24] it's not the truth because we had to
[1:42:26] inject some black
[1:42:28] into it to tell the narrative
[1:42:32] it was well kind of like this and then
[1:42:36] somebody don't you love that i know
[1:42:39] you've done this
[1:42:40] yes sir come on saints i know you've
[1:42:42] done this
[1:42:43] and then somebody knocked the bowl off
[1:42:46] the table
[1:42:48] as if no one would know that it was you
[1:42:51] because you're the one that's got salad
[1:42:53] all over your shoes
[1:42:55] i don't know somebody knocked the bowl
[1:42:57] off the table
[1:42:59] come on the silliness of it is is we
[1:43:02] fall subject to this
[1:43:06] because we lack a true revelation
[1:43:10] that all things my brother and sister
[1:43:13] all things
[1:43:14] in christ jesus always comes to our
[1:43:18] benefit amen amen can someone say amen
[1:43:22] always comes to our benefit we don't
[1:43:25] have to create another narrative
[1:43:27] we can just stand on the word you know
[1:43:29] what come on i run into a brother that
[1:43:31] was just this vocal
[1:43:32] and it catches you off guard because
[1:43:34] we're all used to guarding ourself
[1:43:36] and this brother's like oh praise the
[1:43:37] lord brother paul i haven't seen you for
[1:43:38] a long time yeah brother it's been a
[1:43:40] long time
[1:43:40] he gives me a hugs whatever he says well
[1:43:42] he says what's happening in your world
[1:43:44] and i said well you know the church and
[1:43:45] this and that and the other and
[1:43:46] and he goes yeah i praise the lord well
[1:43:48] what's happened my world i've got
[1:43:49] delivered from lust
[1:43:53] excuse me brother you said what
[1:44:00] he did black and white i mean he didn't
[1:44:02] grade he black and white
[1:44:04] this is what's happened in my life
[1:44:06] lately god delivered me
[1:44:08] and this is what he delivered me from
[1:44:10] praise god i'm delivered
[1:44:13] and the rest of us are like you don't
[1:44:14] have to say that so loud brother
[1:44:16] he didn't care he didn't care he
[1:44:19] identified the demon
[1:44:21] that was tormenting him and said i'm
[1:44:24] gonna tell the world
[1:44:25] my god house delivered me and you know
[1:44:27] if he said i had a lying spirit we'd all
[1:44:29] be like oh yeah
[1:44:30] yeah come on saints y'all look all stove
[1:44:34] up over this
[1:44:36] but i'm telling you it kind of blows
[1:44:37] your eyebrows and your hair back a
[1:44:39] little bit
[1:44:40] because the brother doesn't make it you
[1:44:41] know he's just telling the truth
[1:44:43] i got delivered from this
[1:44:46] praise the lord i'll tell you what
[1:44:49] whatever i need delivered from lord let
[1:44:51] me not even be ashamed of what i need
[1:44:54] delivered from
[1:44:55] let me just stand and say lord deliver
[1:44:57] me
[1:44:58] i need deliverance lord i want it to be
[1:45:00] a revelation in my life
[1:45:02] of what it is i need delivered from
[1:45:05] preachers get up sometimes well you know
[1:45:07] if there's any little thing in your life
[1:45:09] you know
[1:45:12] why don't we get so specific ourself
[1:45:15] lord i need delivered from this
[1:45:17] i want delivered from this i will be
[1:45:20] delivered from this
[1:45:22] but we have a little pride you know what
[1:45:24] i'm talking about
[1:45:26] oh my look at that my cough drop jumped
[1:45:28] off the deal saying amen
[1:45:30] hallelujah
[1:45:35] see revelation now i'm going to close
[1:45:37] with this right here i've got quite a
[1:45:38] bit more but we're going to stop
[1:45:39] sister emmy musicians if you'd come
[1:45:43] brother jason amen
[1:45:46] revelations what seals in our soul is
[1:45:48] that right
[1:45:49] see you can put the pickle saints in the
[1:45:56] jar
[1:45:58] but if you don't seal the jar
[1:46:01] the pickle rots
[1:46:04] and becomes poison to you does that make
[1:46:08] sense
[1:46:09] do you know where i got that analogy the
[1:46:12] prophet of god said you can have the
[1:46:14] holy ghost on your life
[1:46:17] all the days of your life and go to hell
[1:46:21] you think that rich man was not shocked
[1:46:23] that he'd been anointed come on saints
[1:46:26] he'd been anointed he'd stood in church
[1:46:28] danced in the spirit
[1:46:29] spoke in tongues just so caught up in
[1:46:32] the spirit of god
[1:46:33] and then he wakes up in hell and he
[1:46:36] can't
[1:46:36] understand what happened amen you
[1:46:40] see he needed seal
[1:46:42] [Music]
[1:46:44] don't you just love that those pickles
[1:46:48] [Music]
[1:46:49] i really like my dad was just awesome
[1:46:51] making sweet pickles he could make the
[1:46:53] most wonderful sweet pickle you ever
[1:46:55] tasted in your life
[1:47:00] and i remember one year i was well in my
[1:47:03] teens
[1:47:03] stuck with me so there must have been
[1:47:05] something there my dad said i'm going to
[1:47:07] try something different
[1:47:08] there's this new brine pickle thing or
[1:47:10] whatever
[1:47:11] and he said you just put them in a crock
[1:47:14] and you put this stuff
[1:47:15] in on them and then you leave them for
[1:47:17] like 30 days and
[1:47:19] after that you don't even have to seal
[1:47:20] them in a jar
[1:47:23] my dad said i'm going to try that that'd
[1:47:24] be so easy you remember that sis
[1:47:28] my dad always he liked to like to do
[1:47:30] this stuff
[1:47:31] i can remember after 30 days digging
[1:47:34] pickles out of that thing
[1:47:36] and i don't know you can experiment at
[1:47:38] home if you want to but
[1:47:39] if you can just take a pickle and pour a
[1:47:42] little vinegar in something and
[1:47:44] throw a little bit of spice on top of it
[1:47:46] dig it out in 30 days and
[1:47:49] you'd take a bite of that and be like
[1:47:50] i've just gave up on pickles
[1:47:53] i'm done but i tell you what
[1:47:56] when he took them pickles and he put
[1:47:58] them in them jars he poured
[1:48:00] whatever that was i don't even know what
[1:48:02] all it was i'm not a pickle maker
[1:48:04] he poured that in there and you'd see
[1:48:06] little little
[1:48:07] deal dill and you'd see different stuff
[1:48:09] in the sweet pickles all floating in
[1:48:11] there
[1:48:11] and he sealed them up and he put them in
[1:48:14] the cooker
[1:48:16] cooked them for just a certain time tick
[1:48:18] tick tick
[1:48:19] they're out of there you could go back
[1:48:22] five
[1:48:22] years later pop the top
[1:48:26] off of those pickles pull one of them
[1:48:29] out
[1:48:30] and it tasted just as good as the first
[1:48:33] day
[1:48:34] [Music]
[1:48:37] you're right brother tim better better
[1:48:42] let's see my brother and sister we can
[1:48:43] put the holy spirit in the jar
[1:48:47] but if we don't seal the jar we don't
[1:48:50] seal the vessel
[1:48:51] the pickle's gonna rot it's gonna turn
[1:48:53] into poison and you eat it it'll kill
[1:48:56] you
[1:48:59] i'm talking serious now saints i've
[1:49:00] joked a little bit this morning
[1:49:03] i asked you this morning if you got
[1:49:05] something in your life

[1:49:11] hands the lord and say lord i want some
[1:49:13] more revelation

[1:49:20] and say amen amen amen
[1:49:22] i want it to be so real in my
[1:49:25] life and then i can stand here and
[1:49:28] declare

[1:52:58] oh amen
[1:53:02] hallelujah if you'd like just a little
[1:53:04] reference
[1:53:07] you can go look it up my brothers and
[1:53:08] sisters in the message
[1:53:10] brother brown says in the revelation of
[1:53:12] jesus christ
[1:53:14] we need to call on god for revelation
[1:53:17] more than
[1:53:18] anything else in the world
[1:53:24] wow
[1:53:27] he says we've accepted the bible we've
[1:53:29] accepted the great truths of it
[1:53:30] but it's still not real to most people
[1:53:33] because the revelation by the spirit
[1:53:35] is not there i want it to be there
[1:53:40] i wanted to be there in your life i
[1:53:41] wanted to be there in my life
[1:53:44] hallelujah not just something we have
[1:53:47] associated ourselves with
[1:53:49] but simply you know i i had going on
[1:53:52] this morning i was gonna go back in
[1:53:55] and just share with you amen
[1:53:58] just out of the rising of the sun it is
[1:54:00] the rising of the sun
[1:54:02] brother branham's talking about there
[1:54:05] that we become
[1:54:06] bone of his bone flesh of his flesh
[1:54:09] spirit of his spirit oh hallelujah
[1:54:13] she is him hallelujah
[1:54:18] church i i just this morning maybe i
[1:54:20] come across a little strong i don't know
[1:54:23] but you see just identifying yourself
[1:54:25] with the message
[1:54:26] is not going to keep you not being
[1:54:30] persuaded that the scripture shows that
[1:54:32] god would send a prophet in this age
[1:54:34] is not enough you have to have an
[1:54:37] apostle paul
[1:54:38] kind of experience get on that back side
[1:54:41] where you can stand there and say
[1:54:43] ha i am absolutely sure
[1:54:49] that nothing see you could put your own
[1:54:51] words in there we don't even have to
[1:54:52] stick with the apostle paul
[1:54:54] we can put our own words in there it
[1:54:56] won't be money
[1:54:57] it won't be my position amen i left out
[1:55:00] part of a quote there where brother
[1:55:01] brown said some people come to church
[1:55:02] just to be seen
[1:55:05] my goodness i'm telling you that when
[1:55:08] you think about that
[1:55:10] that isn't really you're not coming for
[1:55:11] much if you're just coming to be seen
[1:55:16] hallelujah
[1:55:18] oh my praise the lord let's stand saints
[1:55:21] oh
[1:55:25] yeah well praise the lord
[1:55:28] and take take quite a bit to cover the
[1:55:31] rest of this
[1:55:33] amen i just tell you
[1:55:36] from the depths of my heart
[1:55:41] don't settle for an intellectual
[1:55:44] understanding of this message
[1:55:47] young people maybe i'll just say people
[1:55:51] i'll put now age limit on this
[1:55:54] don't conform conforming won't do you
[1:55:58] any good
[1:56:01] [Music]
[1:56:02] dig in the word young people
[1:56:06] sorry i just feel led come back to you
[1:56:09] young people if you say well i'm coming
[1:56:11] to church because mom and dad
[1:56:12] bring me to church i ask you as your
[1:56:15] brother
[1:56:16] i compel you maybe i could persuade you
[1:56:22] why don't you just stop long enough in
[1:56:23] your life and say lord
[1:56:25] if you're real i'd like you to prove
[1:56:28] yourself real to me
[1:56:30] because if you're real lord i want you
[1:56:34] but you see it'll be how you approach it
[1:56:37] it's all about the atmosphere we
[1:56:39] approach it in
[1:56:41] people say well i believe this i believe
[1:56:43] this and then go do the opposite
[1:56:45] saying i'm not being judgmental but i
[1:56:47] have to question do they really believe
[1:56:49] it
[1:56:50] the prophet said this i believe the
[1:56:51] prophet's word to go do something
[1:56:53] officer
[1:56:54] you see they have an intellectual
[1:56:56] understanding
[1:56:58] amen i'm an intellectual they they they
[1:57:01] see this and they see
[1:57:02] but they also see the part that allows
[1:57:04] them to go around it
[1:57:07] do you know that's one thing that
[1:57:08] separates the bride from the rest of the
[1:57:09] world
[1:57:10] the rest of the world reads god's words
[1:57:12] and they also read in there on how to go
[1:57:14] around it
[1:57:16] well that's why our church believes this
[1:57:18] and your church believes that
[1:57:19] it's because we go this way well i'll
[1:57:22] tell you what a true revelation
[1:57:24] of the word of god takes you into the
[1:57:26] word of god

[2:10:33] as
[2:10:34] husbands fathers listen to me brothers
[2:10:38] it's time for us to break loose of

[2:10:43] it's time for us in this liberty to be
[2:10:46] the priest of our home
[2:10:47] to no longer say well i can't say that
[2:10:50] to my wife
[2:10:51] i can't say that to my children because
[2:10:53] i'm not living it

[2:10:59] where you can look your children in the
[2:11:00] face and say
[2:11:02] mistake but dad believes this word and

[2:11:05] live this word and moms you do the same
[2:11:08] thing
[2:11:08] and children have mercy on your parents
[2:11:11] if god tarries one day i don't tell this
[2:11:14] to embarrass my son if he was to ever
[2:11:16] hear it
[2:11:17] but my son called me up one day and he
[2:11:19] says dad
[2:11:22] at that point my grandson was 12 years
[2:11:24] old
[2:11:25] he said dad do you remember when i was
[2:11:27] 12
[2:11:28] i laughed i said i'll never forget it
[2:11:32] he said i used to think you didn't like
[2:11:34] me
[2:11:36] i used to think that you had some kind
[2:11:37] of grudge or something
[2:11:39] against me
[2:11:43] he said now i have a 12 year old and i
[2:11:46] understand
[2:11:46] [Music]
[2:11:48] you see it'll come it's a cycle of life
[2:11:51] parents have
[2:11:53] grace on your children children have
[2:11:56] grace on your parents
[2:11:58] husbands help grace to your wives wives
[2:12:01] have graced your husbands
[2:12:03] let's focus on the one thing that
[2:12:05] matters
[2:12:06] the one thing that is life-changing
[2:12:09] let's focus on that
[2:12:10] hallelujah well you know what this
[2:12:12] word's producing
[2:12:13] this song's just always on my heart i
[2:12:15] just i just walk around all the time i
[2:12:17] can't get rid of it
[2:12:18] i'm sorry i'm going to wear the thing
[2:12:20] out but i just know this word of god
[2:12:22] you know church i'm sorry i was going to
[2:12:24] be done by now but hey
[2:12:26] here we are god bless you but look
[2:12:30] some people say well you know what
[2:12:31] brother brown read there read their
[2:12:32] minds
[2:12:33] discern their hearts that's his
[2:12:35] vindication
[2:12:37] my brother branham prayed for these
[2:12:39] people and they were healed that's a
[2:12:40] vindication
[2:12:42] there was actually a lot of people
[2:12:44] through that era of time
[2:12:45] that had those kind of ministries
[2:12:49] they discerned the hearts of the people
[2:12:52] now we understand
[2:12:53] that they all come in sincerity but they
[2:12:56] come
[2:12:57] amen they weren't the original that's
[2:12:59] right but i'll tell you what
[2:13:02] i want you to stop and think about the
[2:13:03] saints i want to tell you why i know his
[2:13:06] ministry was vindicated
[2:13:09] because i want you just to look around
[2:13:11] the world do i think we're perfect
[2:13:14] no i don't brothers sisters i see in my
[2:13:17] own life and i see it in your life many
[2:13:18] things that we should preach on
[2:13:20] probably should just strike those things
[2:13:22] but i see god working
[2:13:25] but you know what i know brother brown's
[2:13:26] ministry's vindicated
[2:13:28] because his ministry look at this now i
[2:13:31] don't sound critical
[2:13:33] but the pentecostals are slipping
[2:13:37] remember the story brother brown talks
[2:13:38] about mincing on high heels falling off
[2:13:40] into hell
[2:13:42] go look at the pentecostals now my
[2:13:44] goodness
[2:13:46] they they are they are well i'm not
[2:13:49] trying to preach a sermon
[2:13:51] but they're wearing down them skinned
[2:13:54] down dresses
[2:13:55] they're walking on them big high heels
[2:13:58] they're mincing
[2:13:59] as they walk i see them
[2:14:03] they're slowly lowering their standard i
[2:14:06] look out and i see different things here
[2:14:07] my brother and sister
[2:14:09] but also get a look out and see a bride
[2:14:12] that every day is pressing into the
[2:14:14] world
[2:14:15] she wants more than anything to become
[2:14:17] the word
[2:14:18] did you notion of his ministry
[2:14:22] because if he had preached about a bride
[2:14:24] that would be righteous and holy and
[2:14:25] prepared for her bridegroom
[2:14:27] and it never appeared what would we have
[2:14:29] it wouldn't matter how many people he
[2:14:31] discerned or how many people had prayed
[2:14:32] for him
[2:14:33] but you see the very word that he said
[2:14:35] god led me here
[2:14:36] god ordained me to open the word to a
[2:14:38] bride
[2:14:39] and that word is producing a bride
[2:14:42] and that makes my heart so happy to look
[2:14:45] out and see
[2:14:46] there's a bride responding to the word
[2:14:49] there's a vindication of a ministry in
[2:14:51] laodicea
[2:14:52] that is it my brother and sister there's
[2:14:54] still people on television and
[2:14:56] everywhere else that are able to walk
[2:14:58] through the crowd and say i see this in
[2:14:59] your life and you don't know if it's
