[23:51] for brother brother jose lord give them
[23:54] timely message for us
[23:56] amen
[23:59] amen
[24:00] good morning good evening everybody
[24:02] um the brothers play this
[24:05] video real quick uh most of you probably
[24:07] saw on whatsapp this uh today but in
[24:10] case you missed it it's a quick shot of
[24:12] some youth singing at a youth service
[24:14] so they'll play it real quick and then
[24:16] i'll give my announcement
[24:20] when they're ready
[24:36] [Music]
[24:40] uh
[24:42] [Music]
[24:53] man so we've gotten a bunch of uh photos
[24:56] and videos and stuff and all of them
[24:57] have touched me as a
[24:59] individual but for whatever reason this
[25:01] one really struck a chord in my heart
[25:04] maybe it's the youth leader in me i
[25:06] don't know but
[25:07] for me you see that video and it could
[25:09] be any house in the u.s
[25:11] that the
[25:13] the way they live and things is very
[25:15] similar so it just makes it more real to
[25:17] me you know it's easier to connect with
[25:19] someone who day to day their life is
[25:21] similar rather than um and this is
[25:24] nothing against anything um
[25:26] um i'll just leave that there um
[25:30] just easy to connect right we have
[25:32] ukrainian believers here with us and so
[25:34] there's a big connection there um and so
[25:37] just really struck my heart and i was
[25:38] talking to brother barry and
[25:41] what's happened i said you know just uh
[25:44] that one really struck a nerve within me
[25:46] and uh financially in spiritual uh with
[25:49] prayer you know we as a church
[25:51] are helping but i said i wish there was
[25:53] was
[25:54] you know i want to do more um if there's
[25:56] more that we can do um don't hesitate to
[25:59] to ask i know you have a church full of
[26:00] capable people but as always there's
[26:02] always needs um for us to do things as
[26:05] well
[26:06] and so i said maybe we need do they need
[26:08] zoom youth services um or video messages
[26:12] to encourage them and he said hey let me
[26:15] find out so i'm still waiting to hear
[26:16] back but while i'm waiting to hear back
[26:18] i'm going to start doing
[26:20] so
[26:23] we are going to set up um a camera my
[26:26] phone tonight
[26:27] um
[26:28] probably with a simple backdrop with
[26:31] hoffman's head cry something that's
[26:33] familiar and i ask you to volunteer to
[26:38] say
[26:38] you know husband and wife together any
[26:41] youth
[26:42] 10 and up want to say we'll have some
[26:44] guidelines for you to say you know lord
[26:46] bless you
[26:47] your name
[26:48] um don't have to worry about the church
[26:50] part we'll cover that
[26:52] and that you're praying that your heart
[26:54] goes after them just some simple wow
[26:56] guidelines for you to to do that but
[26:58] we'll do that tonight after church
[27:01] so
[27:02] if you want to do it
[27:04] you know that there's this concept one
[27:06] awkward moment but
[27:08] what good can it do
[27:10] right as soon as we saw their faces and
[27:12] their videos there was an instant
[27:14] connection you said this real people
[27:15] that i'm praying for so now if we could
[27:18] turn around and give that back to them
[27:20] and say these are the people who are
[27:21] praying for you
[27:23] i think i mean if i was in a basement in
[27:26] the nest right now huddled down with my
[27:28] world coming to smithereens a little
[27:31] video message would do a lot of good
[27:33] from believers on the other side of the
[27:34] world
[27:36] so
[27:37] that's a guilt trip
[27:41] no i know sometimes
[27:43] people can be camera shy just pretend
[27:45] like you're talking to your brothers and
[27:47] sisters and we want to keep just a few
[27:50] words short and sweet because there's
[27:51] going to be a bunch of them put together
[27:53] so
[27:54] if you can
[27:55] go and participate thank you god bless
[27:57] you
[27:59] amen yeah whenever we can do our part
[28:01] let's do our part

[30:26] um
[30:27] we we look into that and i don't know
[30:30] brother ivan sister naughty do you
[30:32] recognize anybody in that little short
[30:34] video yes amen so just to drive the
[30:38] point that brother chris was making you
[30:40] know when you look into that and you say
[30:43] i i know that individual
[30:46] there's a connection there
[30:48] and did you know my brother and sister
[30:50] you were just looking at a part of your
[30:52] family
[30:54] if you had looked at that and said now
[30:56] oh oh that's my brother that's my sister
[30:58] my cousin
[30:59] whatever it might have been
[31:01] there's a greater connection and i i
[31:03] pray that we look at that not just as as
[31:06] oh some some people
[31:08] but uh have a real connection sister
[31:10] bonnie speaking of real connections god
[31:12] bless you tonight amen happy to have you
[31:15] here amen we have a visitor sitting with
[31:17] the young sisters over here

[31:25] look at that she's even got an arizona
[31:26] suntan
[31:28] and uh so we're happy to have you home
[31:31] hallelujah
[31:32] let's just go into our thought tonight
[31:36] and
[31:36] thank you to the musicians
[31:39] you know it's uh
[31:42] it's always good
[31:44] to be able
[31:45] uh to to look into the word of god and
[31:48] just see
[31:49] the day that we're living in and you
[31:51] know saints we could we can look out and
[31:54] find plenty of things to be concerned
[31:56] about is that not right i mean that's
[31:58] that's correct just all kinds of things
[32:01] to be concerned about
[32:02] but you know uh not to get off my
[32:05] thought tonight but
[32:07] we have to remember that
[32:09] there's two sides to this two sides of
[32:11] the pitcher
[32:13] and the real reality of the world we
[32:15] live in is not what you see
[32:18] out here it's not what you are
[32:20] influenced by out here that's not the
[32:21] real reality my brother and sister the
[32:23] real reality and the world can't see
[32:26] that reality and so they would judge you
[32:30] as maybe different a little odd a little
[32:33] something but i hope tonight we can just
[32:36] touch on these things in such a way that
[32:38] you'll see
[32:39] as it is why
[32:40] the lord has called us to be
[32:43] like we are
[32:45] he didn't call us to be a peculiar
[32:47] people as in strange
[32:50] but in reality we are strange to the
[32:53] world
[32:54] they they just don't know how to deal
[32:56] with with people who who have a a
[33:00] different world view isn't that you know
[33:02] growing up i never heard that word and
[33:04] then it bounced into our society and
[33:06] into our vocabulary a worldview well my
[33:10] brother and sister the world view that i
[33:12] like is the one actually you might think
[33:14] this little strange but the world view i
[33:16] like is the one where satan took jesus
[33:19] up to the pinnacle
[33:21] and said if you'll bow down and serve me
[33:23] all of this
[33:24] will be yours you see i actually like
[33:27] that world view because you know we
[33:29] could be multi-millionaires today we
[33:32] could be important we could be all kinds
[33:34] of things if we had simply heeded
[33:37] satan's
[33:38] invitation
[33:41] these things of this world are his to
[33:43] give away in the present moment
[33:46] but i like that worldview because we
[33:48] look down and realize you know what
[33:50] that's all right satan you might give it
[33:52] to me today but my father has already
[33:55] promised it's already mine and so i'll
[33:57] just wait for when my father gives it to
[34:00] me i don't need as it were the neighbor
[34:02] or someone else to come and give it to
[34:04] me so this world view my brother and
[34:06] sister you might think that's strange i
[34:08] put it that way but you see we actually
[34:10] can see what satan has to offer and by
[34:13] god's grace we actually can look at that
[34:16] and deem the value
[34:17] as unworthy
[34:20] it's not worth what satan wants to put
[34:23] on for a value
[34:24] and let's just stand and go in our bible
[34:26] i want to speak to you on my father's
[34:28] business tonight i want to take that out
[34:31] of luke the second chapter starting uh
[34:34] with verse 40 struggled a little bit on
[34:36] what verse there to take it from because
[34:38] there's uh just uh quite a content there
[34:41] but we'll just come from verse 40 down
[34:44] to verse 52
[34:46] and
[34:47] we're going to just draw this little
[34:48] font or foundation out of this scripture
[34:52] and the child grew and waxed strong in
[34:54] spirit filled with wisdom and the grace
[34:57] of god was upon him
[35:00] now remember saints
[35:02] that this is the word
[35:05] made flesh
[35:07] but even the word made flesh had to come
[35:11] to maturity
[35:13] god didn't just have him as a baby born
[35:16] and then be discerning and dealing with
[35:18] the spirits of the age and all of these
[35:20] things he come into a maturity
[35:24] and i love this
[35:27] the child grew young people
[35:30] you ought to read this scripture
[35:32] read it
[35:33] very sincere to your heart as you grow
[35:37] wax strong in the spirit
[35:39] be filled with wisdom which god will
[35:41] give to you and the grace of god will be
[35:43] upon you
[35:45] in fact tonight i'll say strongly i've
[35:47] spoken over the pulpit a few days ago a
[35:49] few services ago
[35:52] none of us are children too young
[35:55] to start praying for the holy ghost
[35:58] and we don't want to drill it in as a
[36:00] command to our children they have to do
[36:02] that but encourage them
[36:04] that they can reach out at a young age
[36:08] and lay claim to that and say you know
[36:10] what lord i want to be filled with your
[36:12] holy spirit
[36:14] i want you to be in control of my life i
[36:17] i want to know you all the days of my
[36:19] life as david spoke
[36:21] amen he was speaking my brother and
[36:23] sister the very hearts desire of the
[36:25] bride that i may dwell in the house of
[36:28] the lord all the days of my life
[36:31] amen
[36:34] now his parents went to jerusalem every
[36:36] year at the feast of the passover and
[36:38] when he was 12 years old they went up to
[36:41] jerusalem after the custom of the feast
[36:43] and when they had fulfilled the days as
[36:46] they returned the child jesus teared
[36:48] behind in jerusalem
[36:50] and joseph and his mother
[36:52] knew not of it
[36:55] delinquency parent delinquency it's
[36:57] obvious
[36:59] it's obvious i mean anybody who'd lose
[37:01] their child in the mall
[37:04] or on the road
[37:05] last left them at the rest area
[37:08] that's obviously child delinquency or
[37:12] prophecy fulfilled
[37:16] now if you forget your kid somewhere
[37:18] don't go oh it's just prophecy fulfilled
[37:20] okay but you see this was not delinquent
[37:24] parents these parents were under an
[37:25] anointing because god had a work that
[37:28] had to be done and it had to be done in
[37:30] a season
[37:33] in other words he wasn't going to go and
[37:35] get on his own donkey and ride back to
[37:38] fulfill the word of god
[37:40] so god let the parents get caught up in
[37:42] oh didn't we have wonderful special
[37:43] meetings wasn't this a wonderful time
[37:45] god's presence was here and they're
[37:47] amongst family and friends and they're
[37:49] going
[37:50] and
[37:51] then they wake up and say
[37:53] where's our child
[37:59] joseph and his mother knew not of it but
[38:02] they supposing to have been in the
[38:03] company
[38:04] when another day's journey oh my
[38:08] and they sought him among their kinsfolk
[38:11] and acquaintance and when they found him
[38:13] not they turned back again to jerusalem
[38:15] seeking him
[38:17] and it came to pass that after three
[38:19] days now they didn't just come back into
[38:21] town and just pick him up right there at
[38:24] the gates of the city but after three
[38:26] days they found him in the temple
[38:30] sitting in the midst of the doctors both
[38:32] hearing them and asking them questions
[38:36] and all that heard him were astonished
[38:39] at his understanding and answers
[38:43] now my brother and sister in a modern
[38:45] time we would have to say this is a
[38:47] genius who has somehow got his master's
[38:50] degree in theology
[38:52] by the time he's 12 years old
[38:57] but this i remind you once again is the
[39:00] word
[39:01] made flesh
[39:11] and all that heard him were astonished
[39:13] at his understanding and answers
[39:15] and when they saw him
[39:17] oh i can't help it i this is a deviation
[39:20] in another's thought but my brother and
[39:22] sister
[39:23] i've been amazed
[39:25] at the answers that god has given me
[39:27] amen i've been amazed at the things the
[39:30] lord spoke to me
[39:32] and it goes against our reasoning it
[39:35] goes against all that we think is the
[39:38] normal avenue
[39:41] and god says if you'll do this then this
[39:44] will take place and i i'll tell you i'm
[39:46] astonished that my god could come down
[39:49] in such a wicked age and he could give
[39:52] the answer to this age to you and i we
[39:56] are not sitting here without answers
[39:58] we're not sitting here without the
[40:00] authority to speak back to the devil
[40:04] when he comes
[40:06] oh i'll tell you what we ought to just
[40:08] admit amen we ought to stop and say how
[40:10] great is my god
[40:12] my god is great hallelujah
[40:15] hallelujah
[40:18] and when they saw him they were amazed
[40:20] and his mother said unto him son
[40:25] why hast thou thus dealt with us
[40:28] you delinquent child
[40:31] behold thy father and i have sought thee
[40:34] sorrowing
[40:36] now look my brother and sister you have
[40:37] to understand
[40:39] that as the prophet of god explains to
[40:41] us sorry to keep you standing we'll be
[40:42] done in a second
[40:45] mary birthed jesus
[40:48] the prophet says she was just an
[40:50] incubator
[40:55] joseph is not father
[40:57] mary
[40:58] is technically not mother
[41:04] the word will always correct the air
[41:06] amen
[41:10] thy father and i have saw thee sorrowing
[41:12] and he said unto them how is it that
[41:15] thou sought me
[41:19] how is it i'm getting ahead of myself
[41:21] excuse me
[41:22] amen
[41:23] with ye not that i must be about my
[41:25] father's business and they understood
[41:27] not the saying which he spake unto them
[41:30] and he went down with them and came to
[41:32] nazareth and looked at this line right
[41:34] here
[41:35] and was subject unto them
[41:37] but his mother kept all these things in
[41:39] her heart and jesus increased in wisdom
[41:41] and stature and in favor with god and
[41:44] man heavenly father we ask you to bless
[41:47] the service tonight
[41:49] father help me father to just put the
[41:51] right emphasis
[41:52] lord where you desire and we ask you to
[41:55] be with the saints the bride of christ
[41:56] around the world lord no matter what
[41:59] their circumstance is they are still
[42:01] your brother and under your care and
[42:04] under your direction and protection
[42:07] we thank you for that lord in your
[42:09] precious name amen you may be seated
[42:16] now as we look at this my brother and
[42:18] sister we see this time of the passover
[42:21] and how i could see that they you know
[42:24] joseph and mary getting caught up in
[42:26] that and being there with their family
[42:28] and of friends and
[42:30] how it was and they come but you see
[42:33] this as i already alluded to is much
[42:35] bigger than that because god was
[42:38] starting as it were jesus public
[42:41] presentation the the the the um
[42:45] acquaintance as it was of the world with
[42:47] his ministry and so as he is there uh
[42:51] they are they are concerned that where
[42:54] is he and no doubt they were shook up
[42:56] and uh as it come that they come back in
[42:59] those three days they don't find him in
[43:01] the city park now the reason i'm
[43:03] connecting this with my train of thought
[43:05] which is about the temple and the house
[43:08] and all of these kind of things
[43:10] concerning that is because you see he
[43:13] come back to the one very place that
[43:15] ultimately was rightfully you might say
[43:17] he has thrown on earth but would not be
[43:20] given to him as a throne on earth
[43:22] because of prophecy and so it was there
[43:25] that he was not to dwell in houses made
[43:28] uh of men of of you know flesh and blood
[43:31] to build up to construct but he was to
[43:34] dwell in and had no pillow no place to
[43:38] lay his head no no place to call his
[43:40] home and so all of this is coming about
[43:43] to be fulfilled by the word and you know
[43:46] it is sometimes my brother and sister it
[43:49] is well and good can can you i'll help
[43:52] you can follow me tonight my mind is
[43:53] just racing there's times saints i hope
[43:56] you can see what i'm saying here there's
[43:58] times that we actually know we are
[44:01] fulfilling the word of god
[44:03] there's times that we know what we are
[44:06] doing the position we are in is actually
[44:09] fulfilling scripture
[44:11] but there's more times that we are
[44:12] fulfilling scripture that we are
[44:14] completely unaware of
[44:16] and so here is jesus christ amen in the
[44:20] flesh and yet at 12 years old we have no
[44:24] nothing recorded as it is
[44:26] to say that he really knew what he was
[44:29] doing other than the phrase amen and i'm
[44:32] going to turn that as the phrase because
[44:34] he didn't come and say well we got
[44:36] separated and i thought well i'll be
[44:37] safe here at the temple or you know this
[44:40] is uh look mom and dad right here is the
[44:42] lost and found i knew you would come and
[44:44] find me no my brother and sister as he's
[44:46] speaking there mary is is uh speaking
[44:50] from her heart amen and so we don't
[44:52] criticize mary for the instinct of a
[44:55] mother speaking from her heart because
[44:57] no doubt she was sorrowful that her son
[45:00] had disappeared but it's there is he he
[45:03] comes and you know they're amazed when
[45:05] they see him they're sitting now i don't
[45:08] believe they just barged in and
[45:10] interrupted that would have been rude
[45:12] but they come into the temple and they
[45:14] look and no doubt in the temple they're
[45:16] looking around maybe to ask someone have
[45:19] you seen this little boy
[45:21] and uh you know they look in there and
[45:24] there is this circle of the of the
[45:26] priests and theologians and they're all
[45:28] there and sitting in the midst of this
[45:30] circle is their son
[45:35] and they are amazed
[45:36] what is he doing there that's not a
[45:39] position for a little boy but maybe they
[45:41] heard him
[45:44] speaking and as someone would say
[45:47] something to him he would speak back
[45:49] with a knowledge that is not normal you
[45:52] might say for a child of that age
[45:55] now i say this just as a matter of
[45:57] course when i was 12 years old i would
[45:59] have never thought of sitting down with
[46:01] the preachers
[46:04] would never entered my mind
[46:07] nor
[46:09] in the flesh would most preachers allow
[46:11] a 12 year old to enter into their
[46:13] conversation
[46:16] but here he is
[46:17] hearing what they have to say and
[46:19] responding and not only was joseph and
[46:22] mary amazed those that were sitting
[46:24] there i can assure you were amazed that
[46:26] this young man had an insight into the
[46:28] word because he was the word and as the
[46:31] word was budding and coming forth amen
[46:35] it could not be hid no more than as we
[46:37] come into the spring and the the trees
[46:40] start to bud of the leaf you are not
[46:43] amazed that the tree is putting forth a
[46:45] leaf but my brother and sister they were
[46:47] amazed that the word was budding forth
[46:50] out of a mere child
[46:52] and so it was in that place that we see
[46:54] now jesus established and it's here that
[46:57] we see a whole foundation the way i see
[47:00] it i'll just put it down as opinion that
[47:02] we see a whole foundation laid and so
[47:05] they're saying we we've uh sought you
[47:08] with sorrowing and he says in them how
[47:10] is it that ye sought me yours you sought
[47:12] me with sorrowing
[47:14] wish ye not that i must be about my
[47:17] father's business
[47:19] now the word whist means knowledge or
[47:22] intelligence
[47:23] don't you know
[47:26] he's speaking to them and saying don't
[47:27] you know
[47:29] i must be about my father's business i'm
[47:32] not the son of a carpenter i am not just
[47:35] another child that come out of nazareth
[47:38] i'm not just another you know as it were
[47:40] child of the streets just following in
[47:43] the footsteps of of our our traditions
[47:46] but i'm here to do my father's business
[47:50] and he is maybe you could take this in a
[47:53] form of a mild rebuke don't you know
[47:56] don't you understand mom don't you
[47:58] remember mary don't you remember when
[48:01] the angel met you and told you exactly
[48:04] what was going to happen has it become
[48:06] so easy saint that we can experience and
[48:09] i say this to you tonight we experience
[48:12] a supernatural and it's not long before
[48:15] we have almost put it as commonplace
[48:18] i pray god never let us turn the
[48:20] supernatural into something common
[48:24] we ought to hold to those things when
[48:26] god has done the miraculous in your life
[48:28] you want to hold to those things as it
[48:31] were to mark a memorial
[48:33] not to worship the memorial but to mark
[48:36] that as a remembrance in your life that
[48:38] god has healed me amen i want to just
[48:41] kind of make this real has god healed
[48:43] anyone here tonight
[48:45] amen so as we've seen god as a healer we
[48:48] should never let that just be
[48:50] commonplace that passes through the
[48:52] years and somebody talks about well i'm
[48:55] desiring healing well i tell you what
[48:57] don't be bashful don't be ashamed step
[49:00] forward and say brother sister
[49:03] pray for that claim that i have been
[49:06] healed
[49:07] this is real it's not just talk from the
[49:10] word but i stand here today having been
[49:13] delivered of spirits
[49:14] having been provided for in the times of
[49:17] impossibility be able to be a witness
[49:24] an example would be
[49:26] and i don't say this boastfully but an
[49:28] example would be is we're in florida
[49:31] the little church here that hosted the
[49:33] marriage conference
[49:35] they're speaking of this openly
[49:37] how that they're desiring to own their
[49:40] own building they share a building with
[49:42] another church and they desire to own
[49:45] their own building and it seems as
[49:46] though every bit of money they save the
[49:48] real estate prices go up accordingly
[49:52] and when i heard the brother speaking
[49:53] that it struck a chord with me and i
[49:56] said i know what that is we know what
[49:59] that is to save a little more money and
[50:02] see the price just increase you're no
[50:04] closer but then my brother and sister i
[50:06] this is how i view it today i don't view
[50:09] it as lucky i don't view it as
[50:11] circumstantial i view it as supernatural
[50:13] that one day we can drive by and there's
[50:16] a sign in front of this building and not
[50:18] only is a sign in front of this building
[50:21] they choose to price it within the reach
[50:23] of the saints
[50:26] i believe it's supernatural my brother
[50:28] and sister
[50:29] because we look and write not long after
[50:32] that
[50:32] not long after that
[50:35] we see the prices start to increase
[50:38] and you look and you say well hallelujah
[50:40] maybe we would have
[50:42] but as it was i felt anointed and
[50:45] brother stacy the pastor there i went to
[50:47] him and i said brother stacey i want to
[50:49] share this with you
[50:51] and i spoke a little short trying to
[50:54] make it abbreviated
[50:56] i won't make a claim that it was
[50:58] abbreviated
[50:59] i tried to make it abbreviated
[51:01] and he looked me in the face
[51:04] and he says
[51:06] thank you.
[51:08] that gives me hope
[51:11] why
[51:12] someone looking for healing
[51:15] someone looking for deliverance
[51:17] someone looking for provision
[51:19] it's good
[51:21] to know that it's real
[51:23] hallelujah
[51:25] amen
[51:26] let's not pull back and say well you
[51:28] know i don't want to sound like i'm
[51:29] boasting or i don't want to sound like
[51:31] blah blah blah my brother and sister
[51:33] just speak it
[51:34] just speak it you speak it in sincerity
[51:36] they'll receive it in sincerity
[51:39] so it's there that that he's sharing
[51:41] these things and they're amazed and then
[51:43] he tells him how is it that she sought
[51:45] me wished ye not that i must be about my
[51:48] father's business
[51:50] now you look at that and and he like i
[51:52] said he's questioning them don't you
[51:54] know or have the knowledge or the
[51:56] intelligence of who i am have you
[51:59] forgotten already what the angel said
[52:02] and what my purpose here is and so when
[52:05] i look at this my brother and sister i
[52:08] myself prefer to believe at 12 years old
[52:11] that jesus christ knew what his business
[52:14] was
[52:15] i don't believe he was wondering there
[52:17] might have been parts that god did not
[52:19] reveal to him at that age but it's there
[52:22] that he already knew there was a
[52:24] supernatural knowledge that was coming
[52:26] from him
[52:27] and so you know he's he's going about
[52:30] his father business business there and
[52:32] he speaks to him and verse 50 says they
[52:36] understood not the saying which he spake
[52:38] unto them so i want you to understand
[52:40] this now as jesus is speaking or
[52:42] responding to their statement and he's
[52:45] declaring to them don't you know that
[52:47] i'm supposed to be about my father's
[52:49] business how is it that you sought me
[52:51] i'm doing what i'm supposed to do and it
[52:54] went right
[52:55] over their
[52:58] head probably like what is our little
[53:01] voice saying
[53:02] did you catch that no i didn't oh well
[53:07] you see god
[53:08] knew exactly how to shield
[53:11] how to arrange how to position
[53:16] now you look at this my brother and
[53:17] sister it's actually very relevant
[53:20] because you see
[53:21] god actually
[53:23] wanted
[53:24] the body as we would look of jesus
[53:26] christ
[53:27] to come into maturity
[53:30] before he actually began his work
[53:34] so we'll see little tidbits through
[53:36] history but from 12 to 33 you're not
[53:39] going to see jesus casting out demons
[53:41] you're not going to see him
[53:43] making water into wine you're not going
[53:45] to see him breaking the loave my brother
[53:47] and sister you're not going to see but
[53:48] when he comes there is supernatural
[53:50] things he is doing things don't
[53:52] misunderstand me but he is not then you
[53:54] might say into the maturity of his
[53:57] ministry and so when he comes into the
[53:59] maturity of his ministry when the season
[54:02] is right then there it is he's a mature
[54:05] man and he is able then into the realm
[54:08] of warfare spiritual warfare right now
[54:12] we look at this and realize there was a
[54:14] lot of things threats and and things uh
[54:16] times that they chose tried to seize
[54:18] jesus and and they couldn't he slipped
[54:21] through their miss my brother and sister
[54:23] remember the whole foundation of it all
[54:26] is not physical right it's not flesh and
[54:28] blood it is a spiritual warfare that is
[54:31] taking place so we can go over here and
[54:34] say i i told this person off or i did
[54:37] this or i did that but if you're just
[54:39] working against the flesh you've
[54:41] accomplished nothing
[54:43] oh but boy howdy
[54:46] we like our flesh
[54:48] and my opinion is just my opinion but it
[54:51] actually is just a tad bit more
[54:52] important than your opinion
[54:55] so says i
[54:58] do we not struggle sometimes with that
[55:02] but you see the warfare is not flesh and
[55:05] blood it's not opinion it's a spiritual
[55:08] warfare and then the word becomes the
[55:11] foundation by which we fight
[55:14] there is no other you say fight yes it
[55:16] is my brother and sister sometimes you
[55:18] deal with spirits that would just love
[55:20] to crash the party amen they would love
[55:22] to be there so they understood not the
[55:25] saying which he spoke to them or uh
[55:27] spake unto them but my brother and
[55:29] sister you see once again i want to
[55:31] reiterate this supernatural beginnings
[55:33] can fade into a natural everyday life
[55:36] amen so if we forget the supernatural
[55:39] beginnings that we have now if you want
[55:42] to just a little view of supernatural
[55:44] beginning look at predestination look at
[55:46] the very fact that god before amen he
[55:50] supernaturally knew your heart
[55:53] come on saints he supernaturally knew
[55:55] your heart before your flesh man was
[55:58] flesh man
[56:00] so he didn't say i'm observing their
[56:02] behavior and saying i think that's a
[56:04] believer before we were even a speck
[56:09] amen he discerned through the ages and
[56:12] said there is one that the seed of life
[56:15] the germ of life will be dermatized it
[56:19] wasn't dermatized at that time there are
[56:21] people around the message they're
[56:22] talking about oh we were a dermatized
[56:24] seed before the foundation of the world
[56:27] no we were a seed
[56:29] amen we were not germatized it's when
[56:31] the word came to us was revealed and our
[56:33] heart opened up that the germ of life
[56:36] took life and started to manifest the
[56:38] life the life had to be in the seed
[56:40] right i just planted a few million seeds
[56:42] today
[56:45] yeah literally
[56:48] my brother and sister i wouldn't be out
[56:50] there planting that if i didn't think
[56:51] the germ of life was in it
[56:53] but i can take that grain of wheat
[56:57] and lay it on top of this and leave it
[56:58] there for a hundred years and it won't
[57:00] do a thing
[57:03] but god looked down and said the germ of
[57:04] life is in you
[57:06] term of life is there i'm recording this
[57:09] i'm doing it i have a little different
[57:11] view maybe i don't know maybe it's just
[57:13] the way i approach it but you know the
[57:14] lamb's book of life my brother and
[57:16] sister was a testament that god gave
[57:19] before the foundation of the world and
[57:21] as it were he said in that i know who's
[57:24] mine and i know it well enough i'll
[57:26] write it in this book right here so that
[57:28] later if anyone really wants to see what
[57:30] is happening here there they are
[57:33] here they are right here i've got their
[57:36] name in the book and here they are
[57:38] manifesting the very life proving
[57:40] predestination is supernatural
[57:43] not a guessing game
[57:48] some will some won't some will some
[57:51] won't no
[57:52] god knew so that's a supernatural
[57:55] beginning so your very existence is a
[57:57] supernatural beginning and so god
[57:59] supernaturally knew your heart amen and
[58:02] in that he knew exactly what he was
[58:03] going to do so as we look now my brother
[58:06] and sister the word has come in this day
[58:09] and this is just a very simple statement
[58:11] the word has come in this day to
[58:12] separate us from the religious spirits
[58:14] of the day
[58:15] do you realize what god is doing
[58:16] sometimes with the preaching of the word
[58:18] or the opening of the word he is not
[58:21] separating now i hope you catch this
[58:23] he's not separating individuals
[58:28] he's separating spirits
[58:32] remember this flesh man really means
[58:34] nothing to god oh god's gonna clean it
[58:36] up here what's on the inside will come
[58:38] to the outside so the outside will be
[58:40] clean my brother and sister but god's
[58:42] not redeeming the outside and so god's
[58:45] not really looking as it is to bring the
[58:47] word to the flesh man he's bringing the
[58:49] word to the spirit man
[58:51] and so it's in the realm of the spirit
[58:52] man that we then are activated or or
[58:56] energized to the word of god and so the
[58:59] word has come to separate us from the
[59:02] religious spirit to have the holy spirit
[59:05] amen because the religious spirits we'll
[59:07] get a little further in this if i'll
[59:09] just hurry along religious spirits are
[59:11] there my brother and sister but the holy
[59:13] spirit is what god looks at so the guy
[59:16] who is so pious the guy who is so
[59:18] knowledgeable can quote scriptures and
[59:20] quotes and whatever else just and we're
[59:22] amazed by that doesn't mean a single
[59:24] thing my brother and sister god's
[59:26] looking at the spirit
[59:28] amen and so it's there that our hunger
[59:31] and thirst
[59:32] see we're being separated from these
[59:34] religious spirits
[59:36] now this goes really deep and you're
[59:38] believers and you've been studying the
[59:39] word you understand this but you see
[59:41] religious spirits the prophet of god
[59:43] shows us
[59:44] that religious spirits many times are
[59:46] looking for a position
[59:48] many many times they're looking for
[59:50] prosperity they're looking for these
[59:52] things bigger churches bigger choirs do
[59:55] we have a choir
[59:57] oh we missed that one they're looking
[1:00:00] for the finer things right they tear
[1:00:03] down a nice church to build a bigger
[1:00:05] church and then they have a campaign to
[1:00:07] find more people to fill the bigger
[1:00:09] church so they can go and build a bigger
[1:00:11] church to have a campaign to find more
[1:00:13] people to fill the bigger church
[1:00:15] so really their goal is not to get
[1:00:16] people
[1:00:18] in a rapture
[1:00:20] their goal is to fill up a bigger and
[1:00:22] bigger church
[1:00:23] religious spirits
[1:00:26] so you look at that and realize that the
[1:00:27] word coming in our day my brother and
[1:00:30] sister is just as a young man i worked
[1:00:32] for a cattle ranch many times i was ran
[1:00:35] over by cattle because i was the lucky
[1:00:37] guy to stand on the sorting gate
[1:00:40] and when you have uh you know a 800
[1:00:43] pound steer that says i don't care what
[1:00:45] you think i'm going left
[1:00:50] little me was not going to stop him
[1:00:52] and a metal gate's not going to stop him
[1:00:56] he's determined to go left
[1:00:58] but i'll tell you what once they crunch
[1:01:00] the gate and they fall down and their
[1:01:02] eyes are crossed
[1:01:03] you at that point convince them to go
[1:01:06] the direction you want them to does that
[1:01:08] ever happen to you
[1:01:13] oh i have a serve a loving god you sure
[1:01:15] do
[1:01:16] so much that he's going to let you get
[1:01:18] knocked
[1:01:19] well i won't use that term amen but
[1:01:21] anyway you will be there a little
[1:01:23] cross-eyed and then god will say now
[1:01:25] you'll go the direction i want you to go
[1:01:28] you see so it's there in that time and
[1:01:30] place that god is working on us and so
[1:01:32] the word has come to separate us from
[1:01:34] the spirits that are trying to separate
[1:01:36] us from the holy ghost
[1:01:38] if we realized how many spirits there
[1:01:41] were saints that are trying to separate
[1:01:43] you
[1:01:44] from the holy ghost
[1:01:46] we would be shocked
[1:01:48] but hey praise the lord all we've got to
[1:01:50] do is have our eyes open and realize
[1:01:52] there's more with us than there is
[1:01:54] against us
[1:01:55] so by god's grace amen we can press
[1:01:58] forward
[1:01:59] now
[1:02:01] the thing is is to be separated from the
[1:02:03] spirit of the day
[1:02:05] brings us to a place then that our
[1:02:07] hunger and thirst can be for christ
[1:02:08] alone
[1:02:09] now i was just reading brother and
[1:02:11] sister
[1:02:12] some things that the prophet of god was
[1:02:14] sharing and he's talking about how that
[1:02:16] there are are these people
[1:02:19] and um you know a wife often times sad
[1:02:22] for us men but a wife often times gives
[1:02:24] her heart to the lord and she's trying
[1:02:26] to encourage and influence a husband to
[1:02:30] serve god but the man is just stubborn
[1:02:32] he's stuck in his ways he's he's just
[1:02:34] bullheaded and and he's pressing forward
[1:02:37] just doing what he's going to do and
[1:02:39] doesn't want any part of this but my
[1:02:41] brother and sister do you understand and
[1:02:43] i just take this from an example out of
[1:02:45] a message the prophet is speaking about
[1:02:47] this you understand that it can't quench
[1:02:50] the thirst of the wife
[1:02:53] does she have trouble and travail
[1:02:56] she has bitter tears and struggles and
[1:02:58] sleepless nights and
[1:03:00] she has trials that seem insurmountable
[1:03:05] if you'd like to hear
[1:03:07] something that goes well with that
[1:03:09] go listen to brother danny stevens
[1:03:11] testimony of his parents
[1:03:14] very compelling
[1:03:16] testimony
[1:03:18] of a dad who has determined that his
[1:03:20] wife is not going to follow that man
[1:03:26] yeah
[1:03:28] encourage you listen to it
[1:03:30] because you see my brother and sister
[1:03:32] what happens is as as he pushes back
[1:03:35] brother john steeman pushes back against
[1:03:37] his wife
[1:03:39] her hunger and thirst didn't decline
[1:03:42] it
[1:03:42] increased as she is being as it would be
[1:03:45] pushed out into the desert impossible to
[1:03:48] be in services impossible to be in
[1:03:51] church what happens is is the hunger and
[1:03:53] thirst didn't wither away the hunger and
[1:03:56] thirst increased to the point the day
[1:03:58] come and i when i listen to this it's
[1:04:00] compelling to me the day come and he
[1:04:02] says if you go to those services when
[1:04:04] you come home me and the children will
[1:04:07] not be here and we won't come back and
[1:04:10] so she has a decision to make and then
[1:04:12] she says i'm going
[1:04:15] and it's in that moment right there he
[1:04:17] realized that she was willing to
[1:04:19] sacrifice
[1:04:20] everything
[1:04:21] for the message amen
[1:04:24] and i love this part right here i might
[1:04:26] not have the words exactly right
[1:04:28] but she heads starts turns to go to the
[1:04:30] door and all of a sudden he kind of
[1:04:32] hollers out wait
[1:04:35] i'll go with you
[1:04:38] he gave his heart to the lord and
[1:04:40] pastored a church for many many many
[1:04:42] years
[1:04:43] hallelujah
[1:04:44] you see my brother and sister our hunger
[1:04:47] and thirst is not to pacify this flesh
[1:04:50] or our our our mind you know and the
[1:04:53] world we live in to pacify that our
[1:04:55] hunger and thirst is there to be
[1:04:57] satisfied by the holy ghost aren't you
[1:04:59] glad of that otherwise the world the
[1:05:01] devil as i started this service would
[1:05:03] just offer you more he would offer you
[1:05:05] more and i remember a statement a man
[1:05:07] made one time and he said everyone he
[1:05:10] makes it as an emphatic statement
[1:05:12] everyone has a price
[1:05:18] he said i just pray to god that mine is
[1:05:20] high enough
[1:05:21] that it's never met
[1:05:25] hallelujah
[1:05:27] lord let my hunger and thirst be for you
[1:05:29] and you alone
[1:05:30] let my desire be for you and you alone
[1:05:33] lord that satan would never have
[1:05:35] something before us now look i i like i
[1:05:38] don't know do any of you like reading
[1:05:40] questions and answers
[1:05:42] i i actually like reading questions and
[1:05:44] answers you know it's not really a
[1:05:46] sermon in a way but but you go in there
[1:05:48] because you know what it's not you but
[1:05:50] it's people like you that are asking
[1:05:52] these questions
[1:05:54] i identify sometimes as i'm reading this
[1:05:57] i could see me there if i'd had that
[1:05:59] opportunity to be there at that time i
[1:06:01] could see me asking that question
[1:06:06] question and answer is brother brown
[1:06:07] make statement now we're jumping right
[1:06:09] into this so you can look at the date
[1:06:10] you can go study this if you want but
[1:06:12] i'm jumping into the story
[1:06:14] he said however he was telling me a
[1:06:16] little story once he said that when
[1:06:18] there's certain peoples
[1:06:20] his wife
[1:06:21] they were staying with and he had
[1:06:23] gathered all of his old stuff up in an
[1:06:25] old broke up truck and started out of
[1:06:27] town
[1:06:29] and his wife said you know what
[1:06:31] i ought to have got a drink of water
[1:06:33] before i left that place
[1:06:35] said
[1:06:36] i'm thirsty
[1:06:39] and he said well
[1:06:41] honey there's a hydrant
[1:06:43] said
[1:06:44] well we'll go on till you hit a better
[1:06:47] place
[1:06:51] you know i i didn't actually climb in
[1:06:52] the water
[1:06:54] but i preached services in south america
[1:06:58] and they had forest fire sister jerry
[1:07:00] would remember this well they had forest
[1:07:02] fire tore through their area
[1:07:04] everything's burned black now it's just
[1:07:06] water ashes and mud
[1:07:10] ugly dingy
[1:07:12] a brother told me he says brother paul
[1:07:14] this used to be so beautiful the trees
[1:07:17] shadowed the water and the water was
[1:07:19] nice and cool and you could stand in the
[1:07:21] shade of the trees and watch a baptism
[1:07:23] take place
[1:07:24] but here it is now
[1:07:26] a little dingy ash covered
[1:07:29] mud hole
[1:07:33] i don't know jerry won't remember either
[1:07:35] but that brother must have been like 80
[1:07:37] something years old
[1:07:40] and to watch him they're like well we're
[1:07:42] going to baptize our brother so and so
[1:07:45] the deacons got down in the water
[1:07:47] now we know this pastor i preached for
[1:07:49] him many times and and he's a great
[1:07:51] orator and i know his his program is
[1:07:54] he's put his arm around this brother and
[1:07:56] would have talked about how he come to
[1:07:58] the lord and what the lord had delivered
[1:07:59] him from but you see my brother and
[1:08:01] sister that brother wanted to be
[1:08:02] baptized so bad he didn't even see that
[1:08:05] there was a pastor standing there and he
[1:08:07] just went
[1:08:08] right out into the water the pastor's
[1:08:10] there's like uh
[1:08:14] but you see he was so hunger and
[1:08:16] thirsting
[1:08:18] and knew that baptism was this key in
[1:08:20] his life and he had sought that and god
[1:08:23] had granted him salvation and he wanted
[1:08:26] to get it done
[1:08:27] so then the pastor just had to preach
[1:08:29] and
[1:08:30] it was kind of sad but funny at the same
[1:08:32] time because the water actually was a
[1:08:34] little bit chilly and
[1:08:35] pretty soon you could look down and the
[1:08:37] old brother is standing in the water
[1:08:38] because this pastor is going to have his
[1:08:40] word isn't that interesting how pastors
[1:08:42] are
[1:08:46] but the old brother is standing down
[1:08:47] there now he's got the shivers
[1:08:50] and then to see them two deacons put
[1:08:51] their arm around him and just pull them
[1:08:53] right up close
[1:08:55] didn't do away with the shivers but you
[1:08:57] could see this this
[1:08:59] light
[1:09:00] coming up in him
[1:09:02] my brother and sister hunger and thirst
[1:09:04] is an amazing
[1:09:06] amen
[1:09:08] now look at this
[1:09:10] she says you know what i've got a drink
[1:09:12] of water before i left that place said
[1:09:14] i'm thirsty well he said honey there's a
[1:09:16] hydrant
[1:09:18] hmm i ain't gonna get baptized until
[1:09:21] it's the perfect place
[1:09:23] water temperature
[1:09:25] yeah
[1:09:26] beautiful
[1:09:27] backdrop got the camera okay
[1:09:30] everything
[1:09:31] no come on
[1:09:32] she said there i i'll go i'll hit a
[1:09:35] better place there's got to be a better
[1:09:37] place to get a drink
[1:09:38] you see and he went on a little further
[1:09:40] and said there's another hydrant said
[1:09:42] well we'll just go ahead you see but
[1:09:44] said then when she got out in the
[1:09:46] country there was no pump
[1:09:48] and she was just fighting for a drink of
[1:09:50] water and after a while way over in the
[1:09:52] field was an old country pump way out in
[1:09:54] the field plum across through a bunch of
[1:09:57] cattle and she was afraid of the cattle
[1:10:01] oh my brother and sister comes a time no
[1:10:04] matter what the devil throws out he
[1:10:06] throws a little spook you know that
[1:10:08] message that william branham thing is a
[1:10:10] cult
[1:10:11] started by a man
[1:10:14] have you ever done that well i'm old
[1:10:17] school i'd be there
[1:10:19] you guys would all been like
[1:10:21] had the same answer it took me hours to
[1:10:23] find
[1:10:25] wait
[1:10:27] every known
[1:10:28] church on the face of the earth
[1:10:32] has a man
[1:10:33] that they take it back to
[1:10:36] but because they don't like you
[1:10:39] oh you say don't like me yeah they don't
[1:10:42] like you
[1:10:44] they don't like the word
[1:10:46] they don't like the word saints
[1:10:49] oh they don't they they like you some of
[1:10:50] them would just think you're the finest
[1:10:52] people they don't like you because you
[1:10:54] have become the word made flesh and they
[1:10:57] don't like the word walking in the flesh
[1:11:00] because it condemns their program it
[1:11:03] condemns their their their
[1:11:05] denominational spirit their hierarchy it
[1:11:08] condemns that
[1:11:12] then we just got down in the country no
[1:11:13] pump
[1:11:14] oh my isn't that how god works sometimes
[1:11:17] we just thought we were going to be fine
[1:11:19] i believe the message
[1:11:22] god run you plumb out in the country
[1:11:24] where the very thing that you fear
[1:11:26] you come desperate enough
[1:11:28] amen switch that page if you would
[1:11:30] brother mage mason
[1:11:32] but she said she said levi i just got to
[1:11:35] have a drink so he stopped the car and
[1:11:37] said before he could even get the car
[1:11:39] hardly stopped she was out and had that
[1:11:41] cutting across the fence she had to have
[1:11:44] water
[1:11:45] and when god becomes that real to you
[1:11:48] when you thirst like that
[1:11:51] amen stop this car stop this life
[1:11:55] i've got to have a drink something must
[1:11:58] be satisfied
[1:12:01] oh hallelujah
[1:12:03] amen when you thirst like that it's
[1:12:05] either god or you'll die you can't stand
[1:12:08] it any longer than something's going to
[1:12:10] happen
[1:12:11] my brother and sister we can preach and
[1:12:13] i enjoy the preaching i believe in the
[1:12:15] preaching but we can preach you've got
[1:12:18] to have the holy ghost you need to be
[1:12:19] born again but until now don't you guys
[1:12:22] know i love you so you won't
[1:12:23] misunderstand but until you are thirsty
[1:12:26] enough to be born again it will just be
[1:12:30] preaching but when we and i include
[1:12:32] myself in there get thirsty enough for
[1:12:35] the things of god god will open the door
[1:12:38] and it will happen
[1:12:41] and then you hear people say well we're
[1:12:43] going to move away from this church
[1:12:44] because we're just not fed
[1:12:47] i'm sorry
[1:12:49] you look plenty fat in the natural
[1:12:51] forgive me
[1:12:54] but you look like a skinny cow
[1:12:57] in the spiritual
[1:12:59] and you're blaming your appetite
[1:13:01] on the preacher
[1:13:05] i'm not defending preachers you know
[1:13:07] that
[1:13:08] you see it all comes back to us
[1:13:11] lord let me be hungry
[1:13:13] lord let me be thirsty but also lord
[1:13:16] give me that revelation
[1:13:18] as we see what is said about jesus amen
[1:13:21] that he was lit raised up in knowledge
[1:13:23] and understanding lord let that
[1:13:25] knowledge and understanding come down to
[1:13:27] me that i can quench this hunger i can
[1:13:30] quench this thirst i won't go get a beer
[1:13:32] bottle to do it i won't become a junkie
[1:13:35] for sports i won't become whatever of
[1:13:37] the world but i can find that place that
[1:13:40] satisfies the hunger and thirst in my
[1:13:42] soul amen and not just a sweet bite
[1:13:47] you know somebody i i met a few people
[1:13:49] excuse me but i met a few people
[1:13:52] that they was they've read the same
[1:13:54] things i read about food
[1:13:56] you know those that you know me for a
[1:13:57] long time know the chunky me
[1:14:01] and really inside i'm still the chunky
[1:14:04] me
[1:14:06] amen
[1:14:08] hey look
[1:14:10] there's one more piece of apple pie left
[1:14:12] in the pan
[1:14:20] and then one of you have to walk by and
[1:14:21] say brother paul surely you're not going
[1:14:23] to eat that
[1:14:27] the chunky me
[1:14:29] wants that piece of pie
[1:14:32] did you know
[1:14:33] that they say that the first depending
[1:14:35] on the food the first two to three bites
[1:14:39] is the highest sensory value you'll ever
[1:14:42] receive out of that food
[1:14:45] are you with me kind of a different
[1:14:47] analogy here
[1:14:49] and some people come
[1:14:51] and they take a bite of the good things
[1:14:53] of god
[1:14:54] and they've been reading that same book
[1:14:56] and said this is as good as it gets
[1:14:58] right here
[1:14:59] and they walk away
[1:15:00] amen
[1:15:02] if i was to eat more of that it wouldn't
[1:15:03] do anything more for me but you see the
[1:15:05] words just a little bit different
[1:15:07] amen you've got to eat enough of the
[1:15:09] word for it to make it all the way down
[1:15:11] into every cell
[1:15:13] and fiber of your body
[1:15:15] and when the word has made down to every
[1:15:17] cell and fiber of your body then you're
[1:15:20] ready to do god's business
[1:15:23] amen
[1:15:24] not worried about the world not worried
[1:15:26] about that but look at this now amen you
[1:15:28] can't stand any longer something's going
[1:15:30] to happen you you've got to get to
[1:15:32] business then with god that's when you
[1:15:35] take it takes place now these evil
[1:15:37] spirits this is kind of a shift in
[1:15:38] thought here saints but i want you to
[1:15:40] catch this i included it for this reason
[1:15:42] now these evil spirits deceive people
[1:15:45] and of them spirits many times are very
[1:15:47] religious
[1:15:48] now you say you mean religious yes sir
[1:15:51] even teach the scriptures
[1:15:54] the bible
[1:15:56] they sure do now notice jesus came to a
[1:15:59] bunch of men
[1:16:00] those holy priests the preachers and
[1:16:03] they kept the laws to the letter and
[1:16:04] they were very very religious amen
[1:16:07] hallelujah
[1:16:09] and jesus john called them said you
[1:16:12] generation of vipers that snakes who
[1:16:14] warned you who's warned you to flee from
[1:16:17] the wrath to come and when jesus saw
[1:16:19] them right so here it is john now when
[1:16:21] jesus saw them amen
[1:16:24] you are of your father the devil
[1:16:27] that was god saying that
[1:16:30] that wasn't an angry preacher
[1:16:33] that wasn't some man they said this is
[1:16:35] nothing but a carpenter's son what does
[1:16:36] he know where did he ever come from uh
[1:16:39] we can trace our lineage all the way
[1:16:41] back and they're talking to the very one
[1:16:43] that was the one that was in control of
[1:16:45] their lineage and i i want you to grasp
[1:16:48] that okay in control of the lineage
[1:16:51] and they're trying to talk to them as
[1:16:53] though you're you don't know nothing
[1:16:56] but look at this now
[1:16:57] just as religious as they could be
[1:17:00] remember when the devil takes his man
[1:17:02] but never his spirit god takes his man
[1:17:04] but never his spirit see the holy spirit
[1:17:06] comes into your life sanctifies your
[1:17:08] spirit lives through you amen
[1:17:12] not lives on you
[1:17:24] but when your spirit goes on your spirit
[1:17:26] is kept with god but the holy spirit was
[1:17:28] on you comes on somebody else and
[1:17:30] somebody else and somebody don't you
[1:17:32] just love that i like that amen
[1:17:35] so as you look at this now it says you
[1:17:38] see how this is coming back amen that
[1:17:41] was on now look at this
[1:17:43] jesus john called them said you generate
[1:17:45] survivors that snakes warned you to flee
[1:17:47] you're of your father the devil that was
[1:17:49] god saying that just as religious
[1:17:51] takes that but now look at this
[1:17:54] your spirit kept with god
[1:17:59] what do we have to fear
[1:18:03] what do we have to fear
[1:18:06] we did not leave as it were
[1:18:08] the value of our life
[1:18:10] with someone with loose pockets
[1:18:14] we left our life with the very giver of
[1:18:18] life
[1:18:20] what do we have to fear
[1:18:23] you know some might say oh i'm afraid to
[1:18:25] fly in an airplane i'm going to die you
[1:18:27] can't die until god says you're going to
[1:18:28] die and you could be locked in the
[1:18:30] biggest fortress and never wake up
[1:18:34] the keeper amen
[1:18:37] amen amen
[1:18:39] now look at this
[1:18:40] this spirit
[1:18:42] was upon elijah come upon elisha a
[1:18:44] double portion of it 700 years later or
[1:18:47] 800 years later come upon john the
[1:18:49] baptist made him act now look how elijah
[1:18:51] look how elijah was big old hairy man
[1:18:54] whiskers all over him
[1:18:58] i like brother brown has a sense of
[1:19:00] humor i'm telling you some people act
[1:19:02] like he is just
[1:19:03] deaf on everybody but he has a sense of
[1:19:05] humor sheepskin looked like a fuzzy worm
[1:19:09] his face out like that stomping down
[1:19:12] there with big old piece of leather
[1:19:13] around his girdles like girl around his
[1:19:15] loins like this and if you would have if
[1:19:18] he would have walked up to your house
[1:19:25] hallelujah people have turned god's
[1:19:27] prophets god's messengers god's men
[1:19:29] turned them into these refined little
[1:19:31] effeminate
[1:19:34] look what the devil's doing to the
[1:19:35] ministry
[1:19:36] go turn on a tv go turn onto youtube go
[1:19:39] turn on what and see the big names in
[1:19:41] the ministry now and they'll be standing
[1:19:44] out in front of the people
[1:19:46] and they'll be talking to you with their
[1:19:48] knees together and their hands out like
[1:19:50] this
[1:19:54] check it out
[1:19:57] you want to save yourself a nightmare
[1:19:59] don't
[1:20:02] see what's happening that big hairy
[1:20:08] stan
[1:20:09] um
[1:20:10] my call please right quick such a fellow
[1:20:12] standing in front of my door but that
[1:20:14] was a prophet of the lord sure was and
[1:20:17] then when he died a double portion of
[1:20:19] his spirit come upon elijah and then
[1:20:22] when 800 years later uh
[1:20:25] anyway brother brown that says that it's
[1:20:27] fine 800 years later come upon john the
[1:20:29] baptist and made john j act just exactly
[1:20:32] like they did
[1:20:34] because it was the spirit of elijah
[1:20:38] now look at that spirit comes right down
[1:20:40] amen god didn't have to come as it were
[1:20:42] and have an envelope and say now i'm
[1:20:45] going to pass this down to my servant
[1:20:47] david and when he receives this now
[1:20:50] he'll be anointed
[1:20:52] no sir
[1:20:53] no sir god said i know from the
[1:20:55] foundation of the world who my servants
[1:20:57] are who my ministers are who my prophets
[1:21:00] are who's going to speak for me and
[1:21:02] who's going to act out the word
[1:21:05] and so it's there
[1:21:07] amen 800 years later come on john the
[1:21:09] baptist made john act just exactly like
[1:21:12] they did because it was the spirit of
[1:21:13] elijah now if the spirit of elijah upon
[1:21:16] john would make john act like elijah the
[1:21:18] spirit of god upon you will make you act
[1:21:20] like jesus
[1:21:22] oh lord i want your spirit
[1:21:25] amen lord i ask you tonight in all
[1:21:27] sincerity and i'm not just preaching to
[1:21:29] you saints i'm asking the lord to pour
[1:21:31] his spirit out on us because i want to
[1:21:33] act like him
[1:21:35] i don't want to be a different spirit a
[1:21:37] different nature and just say i'm a
[1:21:39] christian
[1:21:41] amen christian is christ-like
[1:21:44] amen
[1:21:45] so we don't want to be just paper
[1:21:46] christians
[1:21:48] we want to be the real thing
[1:21:51] amen some old chinese proverb about
[1:21:54] no war was ever won with a paper tiger
[1:21:59] you need to fight like the real one
[1:22:02] anointed with the spirit
[1:22:04] of the tiger if you're going to win the
[1:22:06] battle we're going to be anointed with
[1:22:08] the spirit of our god our father
[1:22:11] the lord jesus christ amen all things
[1:22:13] were made by him and for him so that we
[1:22:17] could fulfill the word of god and so
[1:22:20] with that anointing on us my brother and
[1:22:22] sister there is no reason can i say this
[1:22:24] emphatically no reason for you and i not
[1:22:27] to act like jesus christ
[1:22:29] i'm irish i'm this i i was raised poor i
[1:22:32] was raised on this i'm an only child i
[1:22:34] this i that my brother and sister forget
[1:22:37] that nonsense there's nothing stopping
[1:22:39] us from acting like jesus christ
[1:22:43] hallelujah can i get an amen out of that
[1:22:46] now there's where you find the holy
[1:22:48] spirit see that's what the holy spirit
[1:22:50] does it makes you meek makes you humble
[1:22:52] makes you forgiving
[1:22:55] now i tell you what i've met a few
[1:22:57] grudge bearers there's banner bearers in
[1:22:59] the army right they hold up the the
[1:23:01] flags and the and you know all the
[1:23:03] banners of war and whatever i've met
[1:23:06] more than one person
[1:23:08] that was a grudge banner
[1:23:10] bearer
[1:23:12] i'm actually proud of it
[1:23:14] this person did me wrong 24 years three
[1:23:17] months six
[1:23:18] days four hours 32 seconds ago
[1:23:24] and until he repents
[1:23:26] god will never bless him
[1:23:32] seriously
[1:23:33] come on
[1:23:35] i tell you what i want to do i want to
[1:23:36] be like christ
[1:23:38] i want to be like my lord jesus christ
[1:23:40] and if i'm offended oh saint you'd say
[1:23:42] brother paul we've seen you you kind of
[1:23:44] got offended yes i'll admit i've kind of
[1:23:46] gone offended in the last year or two
[1:23:48] god forgive me for that but that doesn't
[1:23:50] mean that the word can't come even if i
[1:23:52] have failed the test doesn't mean i
[1:23:55] can't come and say this is god's
[1:23:57] expectation and then you live up to it i
[1:23:59] will live up to it and we'll all be
[1:24:01] blessed
[1:24:02] oh hallelujah amen amen amen amen
[1:24:06] now look i this is not in this quote but
[1:24:09] it's it's just there i put this matthew
[1:24:11] 5 6 blessed are they which do hunger and
[1:24:14] thirst after righteousness
[1:24:16] for they might be lucky enough to be
[1:24:18] filled
[1:24:19] no sir this is i don't know the proper
[1:24:22] words of this but this my brother and
[1:24:24] sister is a positive statement this is a
[1:24:28] must
[1:24:29] statement
[1:24:30] right here i know there's proper english
[1:24:33] things to identify that but you look at
[1:24:35] that my brother and sister they shall be
[1:24:38] filled i'm claiming that
[1:24:40] i'm claiming that today praise the lord
[1:24:43] now look at this amen as we just move
[1:24:45] forward
[1:24:46] amen
[1:24:47] now i would say
[1:24:50] and i left some of this out because it
[1:24:52] just was growing growing it's wednesday
[1:24:54] night
[1:24:55] and
[1:24:56] i'm glad i did because i'm just about
[1:24:58] out of time
[1:25:00] but the prophet of god speaking about
[1:25:02] this and and what struck my heart as i
[1:25:04] was studying this was just the prayer
[1:25:09] actually what it is i i'm sorry i was
[1:25:11] going to write down the service but
[1:25:12] brother branham invites brother neville
[1:25:15] up to
[1:25:16] open in prayer
[1:25:19] i don't know if you'll realize this but
[1:25:21] brother neville's daughter
[1:25:23] sat right here in our midst the other
[1:25:25] day and grandchildren
[1:25:27] and some people are like well you know
[1:25:29] we they had to remove brother neville
[1:25:30] from the pulpit because
[1:25:33] i guess because brother brown didn't
[1:25:35] know what he was talking about
[1:25:38] because he spoke of the highest terms
[1:25:41] of this man
[1:25:43] and brother neville
[1:25:44] prays this prayer and it stirred my
[1:25:46] heart and in the end after reading that
[1:25:48] i wrote in the notes dear lord
[1:25:51] let
[1:25:52] me
[1:25:54] let me be about my father's business
[1:25:57] i i don't want to get caught up now
[1:25:59] brother and sister that's fine either
[1:26:01] you know god doesn't take all of this
[1:26:02] away from us some of us have been
[1:26:04] motivated in our life maybe more than we
[1:26:06] should have about things of business
[1:26:09] natural but you know what god help us to
[1:26:12] step over here and be about our father's
[1:26:15] business amen not worried about as it
[1:26:17] were i hope this isn't offensive to you
[1:26:19] not a a uh worried about when and where
[1:26:22] we're gonna make the next million and
[1:26:24] what we're gonna invest it in and how
[1:26:26] we're gonna make another one beyond that
[1:26:27] but i say that's well and good if you
[1:26:29] have that ability and god opens those
[1:26:31] doors but what's more important than
[1:26:33] that is to be about our father's
[1:26:36] business amen and his business is not
[1:26:38] houses and lands it is not of material
[1:26:41] things it's of eternal things
[1:26:44] and that's what god wants us
[1:26:46] amen now brother brahm says here in
[1:26:48] influence do you know that every one of
[1:26:50] you is an influencer
[1:26:52] social media influencers people get all
[1:26:54] like oh i dress like so and so why well
[1:26:57] they're an influencer
[1:26:59] hallelujah that's why we dress like sons
[1:27:02] and daughters of god because we are
[1:27:04] influencers
[1:27:06] praise the lord thank you lord i can be
[1:27:08] an influencer after all
[1:27:13] jesus said you're the salt of the earth
[1:27:16] but if the salt has lost its savor it
[1:27:18] henceforth it's good for nothing cast
[1:27:20] out
[1:27:21] trot under the feet of men
[1:27:23] we must
[1:27:24] you know i didn't emphasize this to the
[1:27:26] brothers but really maybe i should have
[1:27:28] because in my mind it was
[1:27:30] we must never
[1:27:32] forget that
[1:27:34] so there's certain things
[1:27:36] in the gospel the way that it's brought
[1:27:38] to us
[1:27:39] we should as it were
[1:27:41] make it bold
[1:27:43] i don't know how big the font your brain
[1:27:45] can hold
[1:27:47] but maybe you need to put it in bright
[1:27:49] red
[1:27:50] and make it as large a font
[1:27:53] so you
[1:27:54] never
[1:27:55] forget that
[1:27:57] oh
[1:27:59] cool
[1:28:01] we are salt
[1:28:03] but if a salt loses its strength that's
[1:28:06] its power to contact and salt can only
[1:28:10] save
[1:28:11] as it contacts but if it loses its power
[1:28:14] of contact then it's no more salt but
[1:28:17] it's sand
[1:28:19] it is to be made walks
[1:28:23] but when we lose our influence now look
[1:28:25] at what he's talking about
[1:28:27] contacts
[1:28:29] my brother and sister this is not the
[1:28:30] salt checker at the dinner table
[1:28:33] i'll never know what the taste of salt
[1:28:35] is if i never turn the salt shaker over
[1:28:38] sister jerry just bought a
[1:28:40] new salt shaker
[1:28:43] i'm telling you it wants you to know the
[1:28:44] taste of salt
[1:28:47] you turn that thing over and it's got
[1:28:49] like a five horsepower motor in there
[1:28:51] and it goes
[1:28:52] and you got pile of salt on you
[1:29:02] what it's got to do it's got to come in
[1:29:04] contact
[1:29:06] do you know your neighbor
[1:29:11] do you know your schoolmate
[1:29:13] your co-worker
[1:29:15] see there's
[1:29:16] our point of contact
[1:29:19] if we hide out you know i suggested it
[1:29:22] once but you guys voted it down if
[1:29:23] you'll remember i said let's all sell
[1:29:25] everything we got there was this huge
[1:29:27] ranch in montana already had like 11
[1:29:29] houses on it and we could have bought
[1:29:31] that thing and just started our own
[1:29:33] commune i mean church
[1:29:37] but where would the contact be
[1:29:43] no god intended for you to work next to
[1:29:45] that
[1:29:46] i'm sorry to say it to you this way but
[1:29:49] that man that's vulgar and that man
[1:29:51] that's obnoxious and that man that's
[1:29:53] slob and
[1:29:56] people say well i just can't even stand
[1:29:58] working
[1:29:59] in my office because the way people
[1:30:02] dress and people they act
[1:30:04] then you run into another brother
[1:30:06] and he's like oh here meet my friend i
[1:30:08] work with him oh and and his wife and oh
[1:30:12] another co-worker and um their friend
[1:30:15] and it's like wow this is where there's
[1:30:17] got to be a story here yeah i witnessed
[1:30:19] to him at work and he he told me that i
[1:30:21] had a devil
[1:30:24] but i just kept after him until the
[1:30:25] devil got tired of pushing me off and
[1:30:27] finally the devil got tired of pushing
[1:30:29] me off he actually listened to me and
[1:30:31] then he was like that's in the bible
[1:30:35] he gave his heart to the lord and then
[1:30:36] his wife saw him change from a drunk
[1:30:38] womanizer
[1:30:40] and said there's got to be something
[1:30:42] here and she got saved and then this
[1:30:44] other co-worker said what happened to
[1:30:46] you dude
[1:30:49] what is it the salt's coming in contact
[1:30:56] imagine that
[1:30:58] people think you're weird when you
[1:31:01] communicate with the tatted up waitress
[1:31:03] or waiter
[1:31:05] people think that you've went out too
[1:31:07] far when
[1:31:08] you act like these people
[1:31:10] are normal
[1:31:15] until they see him on the church pew
[1:31:19] because the salt has to have contact
[1:31:23] and when we lose look at this now when
[1:31:25] we lose our influence as a father
[1:31:28] as a mother
[1:31:29] as a christian
[1:31:31] as
[1:31:32] a businessman
[1:31:35] as
[1:31:36] oh
[1:31:37] ouch
[1:31:40] a minister
[1:31:43] do you realize saints if you come to
[1:31:45] grace tabernacle because you feel
[1:31:47] obligated
[1:31:49] because you don't like the ministry
[1:31:53] the prophet of god said if you can't
[1:31:55] respect the man respect the office
[1:31:57] that's it
[1:31:59] i don't like to go to church when
[1:32:00] brother so-and-so preaches i'm not
[1:32:02] talking about the brothers here i'm
[1:32:03] making a point
[1:32:05] you dig into that you'll find at some
[1:32:07] point in time there's some bone of
[1:32:08] contention
[1:32:10] amen
[1:32:11] there's some time that they have been
[1:32:12] shamed insulted cast down spoke ill love
[1:32:18] and then people wonder why don't they
[1:32:20] like that minister
[1:32:22] but if that minister ever loses his
[1:32:24] influence with the people that's right
[1:32:26] he'll probably
[1:32:28] really struggle to ever gain it back
[1:32:31] that's why it's important you say
[1:32:32] brother paul i had i had somebody no
[1:32:34] names here but i had somebody say bro
[1:32:35] paul you're too transparent
[1:32:37] and i'll tell you right now i am but i
[1:32:40] can't change
[1:32:42] because i would rather you saw my flaw
[1:32:45] and saw me doing my best
[1:32:48] to deal with that by the word
[1:32:50] than to see a man
[1:32:52] that takes every little flaw
[1:32:54] in height
[1:32:58] it's just the way i am hopefully it'll
[1:33:00] work for you
[1:33:02] because you see
[1:33:04] i would value my influence
[1:33:06] more than my reputation as it were to be
[1:33:09] proud of
[1:33:10] did that all make sense
[1:33:12] as a minister we lose our influence with
[1:33:14] the people now we can be very popular in
[1:33:17] the line of the world and go along with
[1:33:19] the world but i mean as what we
[1:33:21] represent
[1:33:25] i'm not just paul haley i'm not just a
[1:33:27] farmer i'm not just a husband i'm not
[1:33:29] just a father a grandfather i am the
[1:33:33] representation of jesus christ can we
[1:33:36] say amen tonight we are the repute
[1:33:40] representation
[1:33:42] well maybe it would be safe to say we
[1:33:43] are the reputation
[1:33:45] of jesus christ
[1:33:47] amen
[1:33:48] yeah
[1:33:51] it's what we represent christ and when
[1:33:52] we lose our influences that is standing
[1:33:54] out how can we blend in with the day
[1:33:57] when god is so against the day
[1:33:59] yeah look at that people are saying well
[1:34:01] we're just trying to reach out so so
[1:34:03] people will come so our young people
[1:34:06] understand my brother and sister look
[1:34:09] our young people don't need to feel
[1:34:11] comfortable in laodicea young people i
[1:34:14] hope you forgive me for taking that
[1:34:15] position you don't need to feel
[1:34:17] comfortable young ladies in laodicea
[1:34:21] you don't need to be if you're in public
[1:34:23] school
[1:34:24] fit in
[1:34:27] they're anointed by a lot of spirits
[1:34:29] there and a lot of things that the word
[1:34:30] of god is against and we don't need to
[1:34:33] be comfortable with that
[1:34:35] nor do we need to be ashamed that we're
[1:34:37] different that's right
[1:34:40] now look how brother brown ties this on
[1:34:42] he said how could machetes say go on up
[1:34:45] and prosper my vision is right with
[1:34:47] yours when he knowed that god had cursed
[1:34:50] that evil people his vision had to be
[1:34:52] contrary and a man's vision today that
[1:34:55] could go with the trend of the world and
[1:34:57] still remain a minister there is
[1:34:59] something wrong with the man's vision
[1:35:01] you know what god said about his rich
[1:35:04] laodicean church put him on the outside
[1:35:07] we cannot stand with the popular belief
[1:35:09] and vote of the day we've got to be
[1:35:11] against that thing
[1:35:12] now i want to throw this in here i've
[1:35:14] got just a little bit more to go can i
[1:35:15] have it no just a
[1:35:17] i just watched this video
[1:35:20] um and and this man i didn't even catch
[1:35:23] what religion what background or nothing
[1:35:26] but his words were powerful
[1:35:28] he said when you see
[1:35:30] these modern day ministers
[1:35:32] in their ragged t-shirts
[1:35:35] they're skinny jeans with holes in the
[1:35:37] knees
[1:35:38] wearing flip-flops
[1:35:41] and their weird
[1:35:43] fritz haircuts in the pulpit
[1:35:46] he said
[1:35:48] that's all the farther farther you need
[1:35:50] to look
[1:35:52] to see their level of respect for god
[1:35:58] wow
[1:36:00] wow i mean there it is
[1:36:04] they're dressing their fashions they're
[1:36:06] fitting right in with the latest deal
[1:36:09] even one of them i recently seen a
[1:36:12] little clip this guy
[1:36:13] four or five necklaces oh and this one
[1:36:16] right here and he peels it out
[1:36:18] i got from a whatever something buddhist
[1:36:21] whatever that i prayed for in the
[1:36:23] airport and he blessed this necklace
[1:36:30] you're cute buddy
[1:36:33] the world i come from girls wear
[1:36:35] necklaces
[1:36:37] did i say that loud enough young men
[1:36:41] amen it's only an opinion
[1:36:43] but it's my opinion and you're going to
[1:36:45] hear it again
[1:36:47] girls
[1:36:48] wear necklaces
[1:36:50] and then not even to look like a closed
[1:36:52] horse
[1:36:55] well look it up see what the prophet of
[1:36:56] god said about he dealt with it
[1:36:58] yeah
[1:36:59] he said those things ought to be more
[1:37:00] like a personal thing something between
[1:37:02] say you and a husband or something like
[1:37:05] that we're not to be closed horses
[1:37:11] made me think of something i'd get shot
[1:37:12] for speaking that out loud amen
[1:37:15] hallelujah look we got to go the prophet
[1:37:18] of god says we've got to go against
[1:37:19] this. now look here i want i want to
[1:37:21] just hurry here
[1:37:23] amen
[1:37:24] that seems like a paradox for me to say
[1:37:26] that isn't it
[1:37:30] now
[1:37:31] i want
[1:37:32] to just paint a very quick picture if
[1:37:34] the lord allow me
[1:37:35] the blessings didn't you love brother
[1:37:37] abel's service
[1:37:39] amen the benefits of serving god
[1:37:42] amen i've got a god that serves he's got
[1:37:45] benefits hallelujah now look at this
[1:37:49] she said unto the men now this is joshua
[1:37:51] 2 9 amen we know what's happening right
[1:37:54] here she said unto the men i know that
[1:37:56] the lord hath given you the land
[1:37:59] now she's just speaking to a couple
[1:38:01] spies just a couple guys you know that
[1:38:04] israel didn't care about their life they
[1:38:05] just randomly chose them no no that's
[1:38:07] not what the prophet of god said about
[1:38:09] them
[1:38:09] they were hand-picked
[1:38:11] men of god
[1:38:15] this is rahab here i know that the lord
[1:38:17] hath given you the land and that your
[1:38:19] terror is falling upon us and that all
[1:38:22] the inhabitants of the land faint
[1:38:23] because of you
[1:38:25] she's given an honest testimony
[1:38:28] we're hearing we're seeing the
[1:38:30] supernatural
[1:38:32] for we have heard how the lord dried up
[1:38:34] the water of the red sea for you and
[1:38:36] come out of egypt and you did unto the
[1:38:39] two kings of the amorites and that were
[1:38:41] on the other side jordan
[1:38:42] shaihan and og whom you utterly
[1:38:45] destroyed and as soon as we heard these
[1:38:47] things our hearts did melt
[1:38:50] she's speaking for a whole kingdom
[1:38:53] one little woman speaking for a whole
[1:38:55] kingdom
[1:38:56] now if one little woman under that
[1:38:58] anointing could speak for a whole wicked
[1:39:00] kingdom what could a daughter of god do
[1:39:03] to speak for the kingdom of god
[1:39:06] in her right place in her right position
[1:39:09] oh you know sisters
[1:39:12] hey
[1:39:13] now's my time i can speak of the things
[1:39:17] of god
[1:39:18] i can speak of a position that i've been
[1:39:20] given to speak from
[1:39:22] amen isn't that beautiful so she's there
[1:39:24] she's not out of order saints that's the
[1:39:26] point i'm trying to make she's not out
[1:39:27] of order god ordained her to testify of
[1:39:31] the condition of this kingdom
[1:39:34] what did the two kings as soon as we
[1:39:36] heard these things our hearts did melt
[1:39:38] neither did there remain any more
[1:39:39] courage in any man because of you for
[1:39:41] the lord your god he is god in heaven
[1:39:44] above and in earth beneath i say amen to
[1:39:46] that now therefore i pray you swear unto
[1:39:49] me by the lord since i have showed you
[1:39:52] kindness that you will also show
[1:39:54] kindness into my father's house and give
[1:39:56] me a true token that you will save a lie
[1:39:59] my father my mother my brethren my
[1:40:02] sisters and all that they have and
[1:40:03] deliver our lives from death she didn't
[1:40:05] leave anything else
[1:40:07] she didn't say well you know
[1:40:10] my my one brother he's
[1:40:12] he's messed up
[1:40:15] he probably can leave him out
[1:40:17] what was she doing
[1:40:19] by anointing preemptively placing the
[1:40:22] token
[1:40:23] over her house
[1:40:25] she herself
[1:40:28] a harlot
[1:40:30] by revelation
[1:40:32] placing the token
[1:40:34] over
[1:40:35] her house
[1:40:37] wow
[1:40:40] that you will save a lot of my father
[1:40:42] mother brother and sisters all that they
[1:40:44] have deliver our lives from death and
[1:40:46] the men answered her
[1:40:48] our life for yours
[1:40:51] once you have been baptized and faithful
[1:40:53] in church for six months
[1:40:55] and once you have
[1:40:58] signed off on our creed
[1:41:03] why is it that man's always got to put
[1:41:05] the little caveat on the end
[1:41:08] [Music]
[1:41:10] yeah
[1:41:11] our life for yours you talk about being
[1:41:13] anointed
[1:41:14] if you
[1:41:16] utter not this is our
[1:41:19] business
[1:41:21] do you realize god was conducting
[1:41:22] business
[1:41:23] people act like business is bad
[1:41:26] god's conducting business he's got two
[1:41:28] anointed men who are down there on a
[1:41:31] business trip
[1:41:34] you probably never thought about it that
[1:41:35] way before did you just on a business
[1:41:37] trip we're down here to do business and
[1:41:40] if you don't tell anybody about our
[1:41:42] business
[1:41:43] huh okay
[1:41:45] amen
[1:41:47] our life for years he utter not this is
[1:41:49] our business and it shall be when the
[1:41:51] lord had given us the land that we will
[1:41:53] deal kindly and truly with
[1:41:56] thee
[1:42:09] you know they'd pay a great reward
[1:42:12] she turned them in
[1:42:15] 1 800 number
[1:42:18] she could have lived comfortably
[1:42:22] the rest of her life
[1:42:24] on that
[1:42:26] after all
[1:42:28] she's just
[1:42:29] rahab
[1:42:31] the harlot
[1:42:34] but rahab the harlot
[1:42:36] had a hunger
[1:42:38] and a thirst
[1:42:41] and ray have the harlot young ladies
[1:42:43] young man i'm sorry to speak kind of
[1:42:44] strongly here
[1:42:46] rahab the harlot
[1:42:48] from rich to poor had tried to satisfy
[1:42:52] that hunger
[1:42:56] and rahab the harlot heard
[1:42:59] that jesus christ was the same yesterday
[1:43:02] today and forever
[1:43:04] and something in her heart
[1:43:06] stirred
[1:43:10] now wicked and carnal minds say well how
[1:43:13] did these two men end up at rahab's
[1:43:15] house
[1:43:16] i'll give you a glimpse
[1:43:21] studies have shown
[1:43:23] in 500 people
[1:43:26] you put an abuser
[1:43:28] and the abused in the same room
[1:43:32] and they will find each other
[1:43:36] i take that research and put it on a
[1:43:38] spiritual level
[1:43:40] you put them 500 people in that room
[1:43:43] and two believers
[1:43:45] will find each other
[1:43:48] they
[1:43:48] didn't need to have a lookout
[1:43:51] they didn't need a road map
[1:43:54] rahab didn't need some inside traitor
[1:43:58] secret
[1:43:59] the holy ghost
[1:44:01] led them
[1:44:02] to rahab
[1:44:04] and the holy ghost led rahab
[1:44:07] to them
[1:44:10] oh
[1:44:10] me oh my oh
[1:44:13] how could this be
[1:44:16] you mean the holy ghost will actually
[1:44:18] lead us and guide us into all truth
[1:44:24] my
[1:44:25] people oh saints i'm sorry i'm going to
[1:44:27] say this it's kind of strong but people
[1:44:29] in this message have got so carnal
[1:44:33] so carnal they're they're dependent upon
[1:44:35] this little action they're dependent on
[1:44:37] this little action i say let's depend on
[1:44:40] getting the holy ghost and letting the
[1:44:42] holy ghost lead us
[1:44:44] we don't need a man over here great man
[1:44:46] over here to say this is what you got to
[1:44:48] do or a great person here to say go
[1:44:50] there do this we need the holy ghost
[1:44:52] we need the holy ghost in our life
[1:44:54] because we are here to be about our
[1:44:57] father's business we don't need a carnal
[1:45:00] man we don't need a worldly program we
[1:45:03] need the father to show us and
[1:45:05] commission us this is your business this
[1:45:08] is what i placed you on the earth for
[1:45:10] this is why i called you
[1:45:12] hallelujah and the men answered our life
[1:45:15] for yours if ye utter not this our
[1:45:17] business and it shall be when the lord
[1:45:19] hath given us the land that we will deal
[1:45:22] kindly and truly with thee and you can
[1:45:24] go read the rest of the story because
[1:45:25] you know the rest of the story you talk
[1:45:28] about god honoring his deal dealing
[1:45:30] kindly with her he puts her right into
[1:45:34] the very bloodline of jesus christ
[1:45:37] there's no greater reward that can be
[1:45:39] than to be placed into the family of god
[1:45:42] and she was there recognizing their
[1:45:45] business is actually my business and i
[1:45:49] will be blessed to do business with god

[1:46:29] amen
[1:46:34] you look at these saints in the ukraine
[1:46:37] i don't know brother ivan do you get the
[1:46:38] text from brother berry

[1:46:43] i don't know i don't know who he sends
[1:46:45] them to i just know they show up on my
[1:46:47] phone one day
[1:46:49] i don't know brother chris gets them i
[1:46:50] don't know what but
[1:46:52] when you look at that
[1:46:55] buildings blow to part
[1:46:57] they can hear the explosions
[1:47:00] happening in the building above them the
[1:47:01] building beside them
[1:47:06] pastor and dinesque
[1:47:08] asking for prayer i should have put that
[1:47:10] up
[1:47:11] i should have put that up asking for
[1:47:14] prayer they've now changed the rules in
[1:47:16] danesque
[1:47:17] anybody 65
[1:47:19] and younger
[1:47:22] a man does not dare show his face on the
[1:47:23] street
[1:47:25] they're running out of water
[1:47:27] and they're running out of food
[1:47:30] but they're not running out of faith
[1:47:35] why because they're about the father's
[1:47:37] business
[1:47:38] they know why
[1:47:40] they know why
[1:47:42] they're not saying woe unto me
[1:47:44] woe unto us
[1:47:46] they know why
[1:47:48] and their faith is actually if you if
[1:47:50] you receive those or read those
[1:47:53] things that brother barry has shared
[1:47:56] he's speaking
[1:47:59] and he's seen great faith
[1:48:02] why are the saints in the ukraine
[1:48:06] just unfortunate to live in the ukraine
[1:48:10] no sir
[1:48:12] the salt
[1:48:14] has to have its contact
[1:48:17] and god said you're the salt for that
[1:48:20] nation you're the salt for that
[1:48:21] community you're the salt for that
[1:48:24] and he's called us to be the salt
[1:48:27] let us not run
[1:48:29] saints and
[1:48:31] don't misunderstand me i'm not
[1:48:33] downgrading what's happening to the
[1:48:35] believers there but you realize you're
[1:48:37] also
[1:48:38] on the front lines of a battle
[1:48:40] there's devastation going on everywhere
[1:48:43] and there's casualties and there's
[1:48:44] people dying
[1:48:46] they're dying
[1:48:47] right on church pews
[1:48:50] they're dying right in the house of god
[1:48:53] for lack of desire to feed on the word
[1:48:57] oh god help us amen i'm going to go back
[1:49:01] just one second here as we close
[1:49:05] talk about
[1:49:06] a reward

[1:49:20] business deal she made with those two
[1:49:23] representatives of god amen
