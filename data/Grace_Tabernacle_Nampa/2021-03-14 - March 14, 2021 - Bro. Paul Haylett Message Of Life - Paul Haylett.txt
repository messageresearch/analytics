heart your presence high five lord i believe in you i'll always believe in you let the whole world say what they make [Music] you know the scripture talks about satan being a thief in the night coming says if the good man had known the hour he would have been prepared aren't you glad today god's making us ready he's he's speaking to our hearts this season we recognize the world we live in you know it's interesting the focus that we even can have but certainly the world and you know they've chosen to be offended at everything they're they're offended at cartoons make believe they're offended and yet the word of god said that we as sons and daughters of god would not be offended that if someone would even speak ill of us we would be in such a position that we would say lord forgive them they don't even know what they're doing just forgive them just to be the very nature of of christ and you know there's a message my brother and sister you know uh i i you know look at the news online sometimes and i'm kind of even getting discouraged to do that because you read the news online you're almost afraid to look out the window of your own house because surely everything has fallen down and is destroyed you see there's a message that is being preached but there's another message amen there's a message for those of the redeemed a message for those of the rejecters and by god's grace we're able to take that message of the redeemed and we're able to look at that and the devil would say that can't be you but we'll look at the word and the word says it is you i'm not talking to someone else i'm talking to you and this morning as we just move on into our our thought over all of redemption's manifestation right redemption my brother and sister god the bible tells us not to hide it under a bushel right live it openly now god's not going to let his redemptive power the manifestation of the redemptive word be hidden it will be revealed now whether the world listens the world looks the world even cares or if they decide to be your critic that's right but even then the prophet of god says you have to go through the hall of critics amen before you get recognized as a masterpiece and so we look at that and just remember whose voice we're listening to amen remember the voice we should be listening to let me put it that way you listen to the world that will bring what the world wants you to be amen you know reading a little article uh well several articles actually there's quite a bit of information but come across this article the man is talking about holiness is dead and you think now how can that be but when you read the article i think he was very well balanced he says what's happened is is instead of facing the issues of our day our church has compromised and compromised and compromised and we don't want our sisters to feel like they're awkward and out of place in this world so we've set no standard we've lowered it so low we now set no standard amen so who killed holiness we can ultimately take it back to the devil right but the prophet of god said it was weak pulpits it was people who would not preach the pure word of god and while they say holiness is dead i'm here to tell you today christ our lord jesus christ is holiness so if they claim holiness is dead they're saying he's dead i say he liveth i say he's alive and well in the midst of his church stronger than ever manifesting himself stronger than ever and you say oh how can you say that well because there's this people you might have met them something down inside of them says i want the word amen i don't need it in portion i don't need it in just some measure i want the word and i'm willing to do whatever it takes just reading about the queen of sheba the prophet of god said you know she'll come one day and judge if no more than the fact that people won't even cross the street to go to church and she crossed the deserts he said she'll be there that day to judge them for their lack of sincerity oh my god help us because we live in a day that says well sure i mean i i can i can do whatever i want still believe there's a god well of course the devil believes there's a god he's met him face to face and he's afraid of him hallelujah and we'll touch a little bit later on that something beautiful i pray today god bless you each and every one sister rachel good to see you i'm an embarrasser a little bit there was a time that she was just this sweet girl that thought brother paul was pretty cool and uh you know she's grown up now we'll have to see if she still feels that way or not but uh god bless you it's good to see you again amen she's looking at me like oh boy do i owe you amen well hallelujah that's one of the privileges we have as we get older you can just write it off to senality or whatever you want but it is i i'm really church i i hope you don't mind but i'm really embracing this uh older bolder thing amen you know um you know you know i don't remember who said it here recently but somebody made a comment to me oh my it was my daughter kristen she makes this just off the wall comment she goes oh i'm sorry dad that was my inner voice well hallelujah i think my inner voice is escaping but you know what i want to bring that turn that around not just his humor but see the devil tries to get us to think about mortgage and jobs and this and that but there's another voice there the voice of the beloved is speaking to the bride and he believed it and ordained it so much he said the spirit and the bride say come see it won't be that outer carnal voice the man that labors and is tired you know like our brother tim gets up in in the wee hours of the morning goes to work and goes right down there and has to immerse himself in all the craziness of all the world coming into the store and and dealing with that i can say thank you lord that i just have to deal with the craziness of my own family but um but you see my brother and sister we're looking in a day that they have a voice they would love you to speak they would love for you to speak their their words they want to hear their opinion come from your mouth but you see we have an inner voice that's speaking and it says you are my beloved you are my beloved i love you lord each and every day we just voice that i love you lord thank you lord for your grace and mercy amen hallelujah let's just stand as we go in the word i want to speak to you this morning on the message of life amen amen you know there is a time a day a season that we come and the words of life have been spoken and uh you know i have advocated for years and i just listening to the prophet the other day reinforces it once again when the prophet of god talks about free moral agency and i'm a firm believer just an absolute staunch believer in free moral agency every one of us ought to do what our heart desires amen if our heart desires i was joking with jerry on the way to town we were passed by all kinds of polaris razors jet boats uh jacked up jeeps jacked up pickups dirt bikes all going there and as we're going there i told jerry it says they're going to the church of the oahe's that's right see that's that's where they want to commune at that's where their heart is at now we're not talking about celebrating a holiday and going and doing things right we're talking about this becomes religion in the day we have the prophet of god speaks about that letting off the pressure they come to attack we've got to deal with the cares of life and so they buy more they go in debt and they have to work more and the stress is greater so they have to play harder i i won't try to quote the whole thing in its entirety because i always mess it up but there's this circle that it just the whole peridium shift of that circle is and and um i i'll find that again and share it with you but it's talking about how that uh we play at church and we made work or religion or recreation i don't remember which one was our religion and it was just a shift like you had it on a graph and then you just turned it a little bit and so we play at church and we work it other things and you know we do that but see there's a message of life that has come and you see my brother and sister you know just sometimes you you bump up against these things and people say well paul we understand you're just a staunch supporter or defender of the message well you could say that it might appear that way saints but actually it's just simply it looks like i'm defending it because i just believe it with all that's within me amen i haven't left you know in the in the realm of the pie i haven't left a little undecided in the pie see if you leave a little undecided in the pie then there's room to fill that with something else but god wants us to just be sold out is god real amen is god present amen is he in me amen do we have the holy ghost amen oh wait but i had trouble yesterday and i got upset and i just no sorry amen hallelujah james the first chapter verses 21-25 as i said speak to you this morning on a message of life good to be a christian today amen it's also good to go to church with people you like wherefore lay a part of filthiness and superfluity of naughtiness in other words all little sideline things where you say i really ought not be doing this but i'm going to do it anyhow that's the super superfluity of naughtiness receive with meekness the engrafted word which is able to save your souls but be ye doers of the word and not hearers only deceiving your own selves now i i don't this is not our focus i want to just interject this right now my brother and sister there'll be a lot of people that will stand up one day and they'll say lord um i i thought i was doing right you know the preacher the church the religion deceived me but you see they have the same bible they have every ample opportunity to dig into it they have the opportunity to pray for revelation they have all these opportunities but i know none of you do this but i do okay did i take a stress off of you you don't do this but i do when we have made a mess we look for someone to be the root cause that's right of our problem lord this woman thou has given me what was adam doing pushing responsibility from himself over to eve that's right was there a bit of truth in that of course but you see when we stand before him on that day there won't be any superfluities it will be a stark reality [Music] so we don't have to you know take what appears or what looks or what could be or whatever the stark reality is there so we're being told to just do away with all this stuff that's not the stark reality and be doers of the word not hearers only deceiving our own selves for if any be a hearer of the word and not a doer he is like unto a man be holding his natural face in a glass which in this case is a mirror for he beholdeth himself and goeth his way and straightway forgetteth what manner of man he was but who so looketh into the perfect law of liberty now i want you to understand my brother and sister we'll preach on this here touch on this but i want you to understand that we can type these scriptures right here as looking into this mirror right his natural face in a glass carnal natural but when we look into the perfect law of liberty we've now stepped over into the spiritual amen amen that's right amen who so looketh into the perfect law of liberty and continueth therein see a very important ingredient you look into of liberty you can't just say okay i see jesus died on the cross he saved sinners i believe in him okay it's all done but you've got to continue in that he being not a forgetful here but a doer of the work this man shall be blessed in his deed who wants to be blessed today i tell you i want to be blessed heavenly father we ask you to come this morning lord just guide my words lord let me speak to the needs of your people encouraging them strengthening them lord father that yes we make mistakes the father will place them under the blood and we will press forward knowing that we are not identified by our mistakes but we are identified by the blood lord and we thank you today that we can claim that and it's not just something lord we claim but the blood has become us and we have become the blood amen lord we thank you for this opportunity to come and serve you today to worship you give praise and glory and honor today ask you to bless each and every one in the name of jesus christ amen you may be seated you know as we look at this verse 23 if any man be a hearer but not a doer and you know often times we we can just type these things back into our natural life and um you know there's just so many examples it would be hard to find a place to start and stop but you know often times we will hear direction whether it be in the home as children as a husband and wife back and forth an employer to an employee we hear something but we fail to respond to it we fail to be a doer of that you say well i said okay or sure honey or whatever but you see if you don't follow through it's the same as not doing it and so we'll find all of these things um that that uh go back and forth of of being a hearer but not a doer and we will find as we look at this uh the mirror image that is here in uh verse 23 uh we have to ask ourself what is the reflection in the mirror with these thoughts in mind this morning i told sister jerry's we're getting ready for church i said you know we've yet to get a mirror put up in in our our new bathroom uh we have this little mirror it's at an angle you kind of have to stand weird to look in it and i told jerry i said i'm not liking this and she's why and i'm looking into the mirror all i see is an old man but you see that's the natural i can look into the mirror of god's word and i see a new man i see a new creature in christ jesus i i don't see an old man i don't see a tired man i don't see you can run down through the list a discouraged man of this man or that man but you look through you see what is the reflection uh that we see in the mirror and we'll just look at this on the natural side first and my brother and sister we'll look into the mirror and and pardon me if i sound just very human this morning but you know when you get older your skin doesn't you know you don't have to worry about things like acne so much you know what you got to do is worry about how deep that wrinkle is getting and uh you know it's like they there's little things online they say well you won't get wrinkles don't smile then you won't have any smile wrinkles don't laugh you won't have any laugh wrinkles don't squint you won't have any squint wrinkles i don't know what these people do with themselves you look at this and realize that in the natural side of life we'll look in a mirror and let's just pick on the young people and you know there's a stage i think probably every young person has you know and they have a little acne here and there and they look in the mirror and they they want to deal with that they want to hide it or they want to do you know something they don't want to just walk around with this and we look in the mirror and as time progresses we have different things or stages of our life in the natural that we look in the mirror and you know maybe the the first gray hairs become a shock to you and you know you you want to to do something you know uh now you know i love you sisters but that's why clairol was invented is because we couldn't deal with the gray hairs and then it come over and got on the men and so they had to have grecian formula because they couldn't look in the mirror and deal with their gray hair but i'm telling you what's worse than gray hair is no hair at all and so you know as you look at that if your hair is gray thank god for it because you still have hair but you look at this and as we go through and i mean this a little bit humorous but i want to take this into a serious note as we look through life in the natural we find ourselves looking in the mirror and finding something constantly for us to change or to focus or to do i need to whiten my teeth i wish my nose wasn't so pointed i i but this and i did that i was joking with my daughter jolin remember them in prayer forgot to put the request in they're not feeling good today but you know and i joked with my daughter jolin the other day and i said you know honey i'm not even 100 sure you're my daughter and she turned profile to me and touch the end of her nose and says there is no doubt [Laughter] i don't know she doesn't seem to have a complex with her nose i think it must be me that has a complex with the nose but you know we marvel we've got cousins and second cousins and all of this and and you know people say i i never say this in public but are they related to you look at the nose because there's something about us in the natural we will always want to change don't go home and bust your mirror let that be a foundation to recognize that when we look into the mirror spiritually if we look into that mirror and we don't see something we want to change then we've come under a delusion just as it is in the natural my brother and sister if someone it always sounds better when we blame it on the ladies but they would look in the mirror and say i am perfect you would say they are vain and when we look in a spiritual mirror and we say i am perfect we are vain there is an image that reflects back to us and what we need to do is make sure the image reflecting back is not an image of the carnal man but it is of the image of the spiritual man that that image and you see we are being changed the scripture says day by day into his image and so we should look in the mirror and be able each day to see the change that is taking place in our life and you know if you don't have change don't get discouraged but get serious don't just superficially say well i'm getting old i'm getting gray i'm this i'm that and i just can't change that no we should take care of ourselves in the natural and we should certainly take that as an example in the spiritual to look into the mirror of god's word and be able to say you know what i am not what i'm supposed to be but i can say thank you lord i am not what i used to be because we can look ourselves this is not vanity to examine ourself right that is what the scripture we read that every time we take communion for a man to examine himself you see it's not really the preacher's job it's not really someone else's job god actually has handed that back to you and i to look in the mirror of his word and say am i the same image of christ i was created in his image am i projecting his image you see if we're not projecting the image of christ then something has come and altered our image and so we want to just look at that and help us to see and help us to change ourselves can someone say amen to that lord let me see with clarity with honesty this is not with condemnation this is not with with any uh thing associated with that i i don't believe in preachers preaching condemnation to a congregation i believe in preaching the unvarnished truth and getting you yourself to recognize i need to look in the word and i need to change i don't need to be forced to change i don't need to be as i use brother sean as that example the other day and you know we don't want to shame or we don't want to cause one to do that because instead it will drive away but when we can present an image of christ that we look at that and say lord that's who i want to look like that's who i want to be and then the holy spirit will move in and did the prophet of god not drive home i looked it up today and i'm sorry i forgot but you know brother branham speaks over and over and over again let me put it that way instead of some definitive number he will give you the desires of your heart and if your heart is to be in his image you can look in the mirror and say i'm reflecting something besides his perfect image but lord i want to be in your image he will change you you have to put an effort but he will change you we don't have to settle for we live in a very wicked age and it's slowly overtaking me that's nonsense that's the devil's story that's the devil's narrative because he's the one that's there trying to convince you this natural decline of a spiritual state is normal no my brother and sister we'll touch in a minute i'm trying not to get ahead of myself he has not called us to a spiritual decline he has called us into a spiritual ascent not descent ascent and so the idea that hey this is the age we live in my brother and sister i say this kind of tongue-in-cheek i'm glad our church is paid for we don't have to try to have some kind of drive for money we don't have to have some kind of thing to impress the neighborhood let it be the word of god that is impressed upon the heart amen let it be that image that is impressed into the mind let it be that when we look at ourselves we can look at the word and say lord i am changing and i can say thank you lord thank you thank you thank you lord hallelujah otherwise my brother and sister will find something else out here you realize how many images there are to conform to today i mentioned the boats well i'll tell you you should have seen that beautiful beautiful boat this morning had a hamilton 212 i'm sure it had a big block in it it was polished trailer had fancy wheels on it pulled by a brand new diesel pickup they just spent about probably 500 to fill it full of gas an image do you know a four seat razor with a turbo is now 23 000 it's an image we can't pull it with a 71 ford f-100 that would ruin our image and it just goes on and on and on and on now pardon me i'm not stepping on anybody's toes but we can't go hunt deer with a you know a 25 year old 30 30 we need a seiko and a tricon you see my brother and sister there's just a lot this image and satan says you're not into that image let me present you another one you don't want that one i've got another one for you you know oh you're not even into that let me present another one too and the list just goes on and on and on as much as there is carnal things on this earth satan's got to offer to us can i pick on you sisters oh thank you so much you know i did a little research on this depending on who you talk about there's only like five to seven basic color trends in clothing why does it take 50 pairs of shoes i think it's an honest question black brown blue tan we've got to cover don't we and i don't blame you sisters brothers we're about as bad at certain things why because just that one shade of brown doesn't go you see what i'm saying i'm not picking on anyone i'm actually trying to put a little humor in this this morning you see that shade of brown doesn't go with this shade of brown so we need this shade brown and that shade of brown and then we need a dark brown and then we need to it goes on and on see that's the flavors the point i'm trying to make to you that's the flavors that satan's got not everyone wants to go to church they're handling snakes shouting hallelujah running around the building but some do some want a quiet church someone at church that they have jericho marches in i want a church that the word is preached because we just listen to the prophet of god say today that where he is at where the holy spirit is present the supernatural is there so let's preach the word then we'll have the supernatural we won't have to manufacture it i don't want to get off in a bunch of quotes that i looked through in the early hours couldn't sleep brother jason i i relate i woke up at like 2 45 and then 3 45 and then 4 15 and finally i decided enough of this nonsense and i just got out of bed and i want to explain part of the other reasons of why i went ahead and got up but anyway uh you just look at that and just realize god's dealing with us and that you just look through this and there is something to be presented to create an image for every single individual on the face of the earth uh forgive me for kind of getting lost in that do you see you look at that uh the words telling us that once we have looked into this this mirror we've looked into that and we see what manner of person we are that we uh by nature would tend to walk away from that mirror and forget who we are amen you know i there's some funny analogies i could give but i probably picked on everybody enough already this morning but you see sometimes we we just feel good about things and i'll just share this one you know that i found humorous and and you know about two three sundays ago when i preached on that sunday uh we get in the car to go home and jerry goes do you know that you got a great big pimple on your face you know it just crushed me i thought i've stood in front of those people and preached my heart out today with a great big old zit sticking out not the image i wanted to be but it's who i was and i can either accept who i am or i can walk away with another image in my mind had a friend he's passed away now in high school he was just meaner than a little buzz saw and when he was well in his 50s so far out of shape so far out of everything he had an image of him at 17 whipping everybody and he went you talked to me looked up i'll just whip you i don't think so but the image is there you know the prophet of god said we shouldn't be living on an experience that's somewhere in our past we have an image of us prayed through we have an image of us filled with the holy ghost we have an image of us on fire for god and if we're not careful we live under the shadow of that image for many many many years but we're not even the reflection of that image we've now become something else we become the doty christian we become the lazy christian we become the out of tune christian but living on an image of a time that god answered prayers and god moved in our midst and and we felt on fire felt invincible amen you see we're called to live in the present not the past and we're also not called to live in the future we're called to live in the present i look to the day that the rapture comes but my brother and sister i live today as though today is the day i'm not looking at some future tense of some time god's going to come i believe the prophet's words when he said we should believe he would come at any moment oh lord help us that's a hard one saints isn't it amen let's be honest with ourselves that sometimes we live like well if i can make it till sunday and get my battery recharged you need to find a charging station right now hallelujah you see if we walk away and forget who we are now the word of god says we were created in his image do we believe that amen so if we're created in his image let us reflect his image not another image not satan's image not something that's created in the world we live in today we can say well you know i kind of tend to agree you know that that it is true how do you like this mentality of the council cancel culture the old wesleyan movement now is struggling within their leadership the various churches that kind of fall under that umbrella they're now embracing the idea that a sister not cutting her hair and wearing a dress and looking godly is a form of bondage that should be released by women's suffrage which means that we as men should take our hands off trying to dominate our wives where do you think that will take the church this is not something 50 years ago saints this is what's happening in our culture right now we have no right to preach the word of god and ask someone to line up to that word that's bondage we need to set the people free and let them do what they want to do and i oh i hope i don't confuse you i say amen but thank you lord that there's a people that say there's the word of god that was the mind of god that is his word that is his desire and i will bind myself it's not going to be the preacher it's not going to be the message it's not going to be those over there those over there i bind myself to jesus christ you see that mentality you see how that spirit creeps in i want more liberty i want more liberty now pardon me if you're wearing high heels i'm not picking on you but you ought to listen yes sir go back study what the prophet of god said it's endemic my brother and sister that it creeps in and we buy a little taller a little taller a little taller and we say well i don't want the pastor to preach against that well my brother and sister i'm not pre-preaching clothesline religion i'm preaching holiness you decide what holiness is to you oh this gets a little tricky doesn't it brother george how tall of heels did sister rebecca wear it all depended on what parachute she had on you know why you get an answer like that because the size of the heels that you're wearing will directly correspond to your view of holiness how'd you like that step around otherwise you know what i have to do we'll have to take a sawzall and make a little foot bracket and when you walk into church you step in it and it activates the saw and if it cuts off your heel that was too long and if it doesn't you're okay you know what that does causes you to wear one shoe to church and another one everywhere else creates hypocrisy amen so you say brother paul where are you going with this i'm telling you follow the dictates of your heart but pray about being holy holiness is not a measure or standard it is a life it is a life and if our god is holy and the word of god says we are holy because he is holy then there is a standard out there but i'm not going to set it for you i'm not going to be the one that holds the tape measure and tells you good enough not good enough the holy spirit speaking to you should tell you pray about it that's what i'm asking you to do actually pray about it we'll just skip beyond that yes i thought you'd all be like maybe jumping up running down the aisles praise the lord brother paul preach it but those folks must not made it to church today so now look the marriage of the lamb as i say to you all the time saints we can't just read every bit of every quote way in front of it way behind it just want to stir your mind up because there's no other tower no other stand but the name of the lord is a mighty tower that the righteous run into and are safe when you run into it you take the name now remember this scripture speaking of seven women taking one man we don't we'll provide for ourself we just want your name you see they're not really taking his name his name now becomes a false covering right because they've never submitted to him they've never identified completely with him they just have that name now i tell you uh forgive me to take it into this avenue but i will my brother and sister we live in a day of hyphenated names now i am not paul halett mrs jesus christ i have relinquished my own identity and i take the word of god and identify as the bride of christ i am mrs jesus christ if i take my own my own identity then you will find the human hail it nature and my sister can testify the hail it's have a nature oh my they are stubborn we're not always right but about 99.999 percent of the time we are you see it's not about taking a name and keeping the nature when we identify in the name we are taking his nature amen so we don't come you know i had a friend kind of jokingly i guess he's got a a brother-in-law that this happened to uh it would be i think his wife's brother married another girl he's a meat eater like you can't believe and she's a vegetarian to the very end and he said it's very interesting to go to their house because he's trying to throw meat on her plate and she's throwing veggies on his plate and when it's all done they're still veggies on one plate and still meet on the other because they refuse to move and he said you know it just seems contradictory it's actually kind of funny he said when they have a barbecue at their house he's out there cooking a big old steak and she's out there cooking her cauliflower just a hard image for me now any of you that are vegetarians i don't mean to put down on that but it's just a hard image you know that we have a nice grill and we're grilling cauliflower you can eat cauliflower anyway you take the name the name not just calling a name but the name and the person that you are christ like in the life amen wonderful he is yes church now this is the part i want to get church has done the same committing spiritual fornications as a woman that would share love from her husband to another man that woman is not fit to be lived with you know that and when the church begins to share her fellowship with the world god is a jealous god he put israel away because of that his own son will put the same thing away he's going to have a bride that hasn't got a wrinkle in her amen she is holy washed by the blood of his own self that's right so we see where we stand the wedding is getting ready to come amen can we say amen to that now we find she commits spiritual fornications going out with the world professing something i hope this doesn't pinch any of you i hope you can just say praise the lord that's not me i looked in the mirror of the word this morning and that was not me amen professing something living something different i'm not being too hard this morning am i come on saints we just gotta we gotta remind ourselves the devil's trying to get us to come follow his way now won't never work what the church ought to do is do like esther did esther refused the adorning of the world amen i want you to think about this everything that esther desired not only when she was coming up to present herself to the king the first but as the king's wife everything she desired was there to be given to her i hope you don't mind me being a little direct this morning she could have hiked the skirt up a little she could have cut whatever you would call the bodus or whatever bodice or my wife's just like one sorry i don't specialize in that could have cut the front down and raised the hem up she could have made it so tight what do they call those wiener skirts she could have said that's what i want i'm going to present myself to the king today like this and remind him it's the new fashion of the church but the prophet of god goes we won't read those quotes today but the prophet of god said no what she did is she presented herself in humility she presented herself in that image that reflected her character amen think about that maybe how we dress is a reflection of our character oh brother paul you have no right to say that i'm just asking you the question amen what if how we dress reflects the real character of our heart god help us yes god help us saints i want to see you in a rapture i want to i want to stroll over as the song says i want to stroll over heaven with you amen esther refused the adorning of the world we know that little book of esther how that mordecai his uncle had a daughter and was down during the times of the reigns of the medes and persians a very beautiful type there the king one of the greatest kings in the world that day he had a great feast and he called the queen to come set by him but she wouldn't do it now i want this to soak in because this leads somewhere here over into this spiritual realm amen but she wouldn't do it she refused to do it so what did he do he was so humiliated didn't know what to do that his own wife wouldn't come here's the punchline and i think that's a whole lot like christ today christ has invited us to set in heavenly places with him and we're ashamed of it many people are ashamed to say they've got the baptism of the holy ghost pentecostal people that's right they're ashamed to say it we're ashamed of him amen now let's just take once and for all church and take the whole pentecostal movement and get it out of our mind that that's a denomination that's it amen the day of pentecost did not have a board of elders the day of pentecost didn't have a rule book the day of pentecost didn't have a tradition of expectation right like one of them great pentecostal preachers of this day right now has come and blasted them and says you know what y'all talked in tongues y'all did this but what you don't have is a life you say you've got christ you got the holy ghost because you spoke in tongues but you don't have a life speaking in tongues imagine this this one they're very well accepted straight down the middle preachers and he didn't do it in some backyard he did in a great televised convention and says you spoke in tongues you did all this stuff but you're dishonest and you do things over here in the dark and you're doing this and because why you don't have a life they're looking for oil saints they're starting to recognize speaking in tongues is great we believe it's the initial evidence of the holy ghost but there's got to be a life that backs this up and it's now become a mantra for them we've got to find this life we've got to find this life we've got to find this life why is he saying this he puts it right blunt to them because we now have just as many divorces as anyone else we have just as many kids on drugs we have just as many drunks in our church we have just as many nonsense but we spoke in tongues can i kick you in the shins the same spirit's creeping right in the message not in this church and i pray god as long as i've got breath in my body it'll never be allowed in this church but we've got message churches that the people on this side are getting divorced and he's marrying the woman over here that just divorced her husband and then they're all sitting right on the center aisle ex-husband over here ex-wives over here oh praise god they believe god sent a prophet where's the life that's it where's the life there has to be a life let's look in the mirror am i alive or do i just have a form huh i don't want to be ashamed of him in fact let me tell you i i just uh to for the sake of time i i i just a little farther down not far beyond that you can go uh brother brown says i'm glad i bear the name of jesus christ it's the greatest privilege i've ever had to say that i'm a part of him amen amen oh my yes hallelujah now i want you to think about this my brother and sister the whole story of esther i just kind of trying to wrap it on i want to move on beyond esther and my thoughts and studies but you look at this my brother and sister esther being raised as a orphan child being raised up and you know she accepted mordecai as as her father he's really just her uncle but accepted and and she believed his words she followed his advice and and uh some you know a huge portion no doubt of the character that she had uh was uh placed or influenced in her life because of mordecai and so as we come down to this great time a haman is is uh bent on destroying the jews he sees it as an opportunity to steal their wealth much like the same spirit that come upon hitler in the uh world war ii in that era they as much as they hated the jews and and gave all of their reasons why they were actually looking at the wealth of the jewish people and they wanted that wealth they wanted to possess it for themselves and inherently you will understand that the spirit that was in this um uh in these people in this nature was a wicked spirit now this isn't to say my brother and sister that these orthodox jews and their business practices and what they were doing were that really spiritual people that they were really you know on fire for god they had fallen into a rut uh their real goal at that time if you'll study history uh literally was to make money oh i pray we don't let that spirit get all over us amen and so you look at this you know because brother branham blasted you know these these big churches this finery we're impressing everybody by what we have and what image we can project my brother and sister it don't matter how big a church you're in if you get the baptism of the holy ghost you won't care whether you're in the backyard the front yard or the biggest church in the nation what you'll care about is that you met god face to face and if you haven't met him it won't matter if you're in the front yard the backyard or the biggest church in the nation you still have not met him amen so you look at this and realize that haman now has this influence on her and it comes to this time and you know this scripture you know the story uh all back and forth and mordecai's out there and sackcloth and ashes and uh some of esther's servants uh uh come and they tell her you know what is happening mordecai's out there by the gates and he's in sackcloth and asses he's he's wailing moaning and and uh we don't know what's going on finally she gets the answer finds out that haman is uh building a gallows and is uh got a king's decree to destroy what was the enemies i want you to think about this my brother and sister the enemies of the nation i don't know you can no don't find it if you look far enough it kind of got suppressed and pushed back down because it just was a little bit strong for the season but there's a democratic government official back east that not that far in the past stood up and made a public statement said christians are the number one enemy of our nation i wouldn't even say anointed by the devil he might have been anointed by god god said he would give us the signs he would show us where we're headed so we see the parallel of this story that haman viewed the jews as the enemy of the nation and now they're saying the problem we have in america is the christians and i can understand that i mean i have burnt and blazed and beaten and whatever else just anything and everything around me i don't i imagine you guys do that at night too you know yeah see it said what is good would be called evil and what is evil would be called good and we're seeing this all come to pass right before us that's why i feel so strongly about this story about esther because there's so many parallels that come and show us the day that we're living in and i'm telling you let me get going along here i don't i don't want to keep you forever today but i'm working on it amen so look at this mordecai's words to esther is don't run away from this don't think you can hide from this don't think this won't apply to you because it will and if there isn't deliverance from you god will let you be judged and deliverance will come from somewhere else you were born for such a time as this now i want you to understand how that would have driven down in her good little holy ghost-filled heart right godly young woman and drove down in her heart i literally was called for this season can someone say amen i wasn't called for some other day my brother and sister i wasn't called for some other deal i wasn't called to be in a lukewarm thing and not hear the truth i was called you were called to hear the truth and not only hear the truth but be a doer not look in the mirror and walk away and forget who you are and take on a spirit of laodicea he didn't call you to look in the mirror and say everything's fine in my world he called you to look in the mirror and say lord i want your nature i want your life and i will pay the price whatever it is to be what you called me to be hallelujah amen or we can preach that other kind of gospel that says you know what let's just go undercover we'll laugh at their jokes be partakers of and then tell the lord lord you understand they never wait to hear from him to see if he actually responds whether he understood or not they just assume amen he understands well i'll tell you what he understands he understands that his word is his will amen yeah come on saints no i'm not angry this morning i'm actually quite happy amen hallelujah now let's look at the nature my brother and sister look at this mordecai's words are you you were born for such a time as this you can't hide from this see a bride a wife who knows who she is see that's what separated if we could just catch the revelation of this how the chamberlain's eunuchs maids everyone loved esther and when she says i'm going to go before the king they are not just like oh you can't do that that's against the rules they were in fear they literally were in fear thank you lord that they was rent amen thank you lord that it's no longer that we have to fear to go before the king do you realize saints that when esther went that day no doubt she had apprehension in her heart but she didn't go and she didn't suddenly clip on the earrings and the long fingernails and the gaudy whatever and do all this what did she do she knew the desire of her husband and she went back to the desire of her husband because that was her desire and she adorned herself as always oh you dodio message sisters praise the lord praise the lord we don't have to go out here and waddle down the street and be so ridiculous that's right come on i don't mean to be crude my brother and sister but we were at a store the other day and there was this lady that was you might say there was just a lot of her and she jumped into somebody else's clothes and she's walking around like that and there was not one thing attractive in fact it was revolting but the anointing is if i jump in this spandex and i put on a t-shirt spandex thing that's way too small for me and i go out in public i'm sorry i'm being just blunt with you but i'm telling you there is an anointing that they think they have something to show off when in reality any normal human that hasn't lost their mind would say i would never be caught in public like that but the delusion the delusions getting stronger the devil the devil's going that's it i like it you're cute sweetie maybe i'm being a little blunt this morning but look come on it's time for us to recognize we're not of this world amen the prophet of god said she didn't adorn herself in the world she adorned herself in meekness amen hallelujah she adorned herself as a humble person in fact the word says that she was a joy to be around amen praise the lord i've been a message believer for 40 years don't you just even don't even look at me our family was messaged before you were even born praise god we got the holy ghost you're ugly you're dumb hear this hear that praise god i got the holy ghost no sorry wrong spirit amen you're putting on the adorning of something else put on the adorning of a meek and quiet spirit is what the church says oh and the prophet of god says that doesn't apply just to sisters only that applies to men hmm come on brother brown uses the term you know they fight a buzzsaw come on come on saints i met a few people like that yes yeah praise the lord you know this might be a great time church are we going to have an election or you want to just go on like we're doing keep preaching i'm not joking we have kind of skipped over you guys didn't want to have an election last year we didn't you need to pray about it you really ought to either you know put a stamp of approval on your ministry we're not here to assume we're here to follow the word that's right amen see esther didn't approach her husband with demands look at this now she's brave she walks in the foyer and she comes in and presents herself and and he looks out there no doubt the king is busy it's been 30 days look at your look at your bible she said i haven't i have he hasn't even called me in 30 days that's a whole lot different my my brother sister at a different world than the day we live in right she's like i haven't seen him in 30 days she adorns herself she goes stands in the foyer and he looks up from important business of his kingdom crossed his arms got a big scowl on his face how dare this woman no sir something in his heart that's it that's my wife isn't she beautiful and since she's character there's something about her i've never ever seen ever before i can see him telling the servant give me my scepter i can see him almost meeting her that's my wife well i'm telling you king husband i'm telling you there's this rotten man in your kingdom and he's trying to destroy everything and you gotta you gotta this and you gotta that and we need to settle this right now no come on saints talk about a prayer life what kind of prayer life do we got to our king amen you've got to this you got to that this has to happen right now he says what do you want i'll give you to the half of my kingdom it says i want to have lunch with you that's right i want a little fellowship i want a little communion the next day comes and she's got this all prepared and they're there and they eat and and we look at all of this and then when it comes and and and he's like now what is it that you want honey and he says i want to have lunch with you again tomorrow what was she doing saints she was coming and creating an atmosphere creating an atmosphere because she knew what she was fixing to ask was serious it wasn't paddy cakes lord i got children not serving the lord you have to save them i applied the token no no no no no atmosphere create an atmosphere amen dine with your lord dine with the king amen tell him that you love him do things for him serve him amen [Music] where brother branham says that this bride of christ will serve her husband natural spiritual let's look at this so what was it you noticed well maybe we're surmising will you forgive me for surmising a little bit i'm maybe you guys prove me wrong i guess i read this i just don't see where esther was there with a servant pour him some water give them some grapes do this do that i i read the story that it was the king heyman and esther she was serving her husband oh i hope you get to see this the way i see it while she was serving her husband she was bringing judgment on the devil amen amen she's there serving her husband and she was presenting an atmosphere creating an atmosphere that when she asked for deliverance from the control of the adversary that he was right there saying whatever you say you say what you want read your bible read your bible he turns to her you say what you want the king did not pass judgment on haman it was esther who passed judgment on amen and this bride of christ my brother and sister is not bound by the devil not bound by the spirit of the age not bound by some kind of complex but when she speaks the word her husband listens and says whatever thy that you want ask anything in my name and i'll give it to you [Music] hallelujah oh look at this my brother and sister she created an atmosphere she had the right actions the right words what did she do it brought a message of life you say but it wasn't right there in that moment it brought a message of life no sir my brother and sister the king went back and he wrote a decree that said sons and daughters of god can take my word that i have put my stamp on and given my approval to it and they can defend their very life defend their household whoa praise the lord god wants you to hear that defend your household you've been given rights from almighty god to defend your household and take spoil of the devil and in that you can take spoil of the devil as take dominion over him or do you just like your hot cold in out powerless message church you see satan's got a wish list he takes names and he knows exactly what to give you come on what he gives to brother trevor is not the same brother david's brother jason right on down the line taylor taylormade and satan's got his wish list and what's really sad breaks my heart even with my name on it he gets to check that wishlist off a lot more than we would like him to why because we've come and we said well i prayed about it i prayed about it brother paul i prayed about it brother paul but the bible says you ask amiss that's right you say but i didn't think i did no that's because you see we never communion with him right let me just put this type becomes the wife i'm not speaking to no one in general okay becomes the wife that her communion with her husband is give me give me give me give me i want now amen that's not communion no sir that's not an atmosphere now the fact that that trails in the natural just the same as it does in the spiritual is not beside the fact but it's just a fact amen i'll tell you the man you want a way to a man sisters you butter him up i thought i'd hear an amen brother no sir i'm not kidding sisters you'll get a whole lot more about throwing your arms around him you might have to lock the kids in the bedroom or whatever so that anyway he walks in the door you throw your arms around him oh come on is this too blunt are we we not humans or throw your arms around him and smack him on the lips till he's dizzy you get a lot more out of him than when he walks in the door and you're like you said you'd have this fixed by monday and it's friday now and if you don't do this if it goes you didn't mean next monday it was this week and i'm i mean my daddy to do this come on pick any way you want come on he'll appreciate well anyway come on are we all this morning are we honest totally honest this morning way too often we talk to god like he failed to deliver what we wanted him to deliver on time my i'm ripping hide off of people and i was going to preach a happy message this morning my now let's look at this christ the mystery of god reveal then we stand justified in the presence of god as a drop of ink dropping into a tub full of bleach you'll never find the stain of the ink no more it went somewhere and never come back again and when a man is truly redeemed that predestinated seed that sees it and accepts it his sins are demolished not displaced not tucked away for future reference demolished it's gone it's separated it's dropped in the ink of the blood of jesus christ and it's never to be remembered god forgets it and you don't want to know the problem is we often forget that god forgets it and the devil comes along and says you you you you and we're like yes yes yes yes come on god forgot it put it under the blood your own self wife your husband repents put it under the blood husband your wife repents of something put it under the blood parents children brother sister sister sister sister brother brother says whatever it might be amen when it's repented put it under the blood and forget it amen in fact i want to i want to just put it this way this is opinion if i could put you is that way my brother and sister we get an arrogant spirit and we think that what god has put under the blood we have a right to march in there latch onto that thing and come out and say do you remember that's an arrogant spirit right there amen god ain't gonna remember it but i have a right to i'm talking about true repentance not some half-hearted man i'm sorry amen let's never remember god forgets it he stands as the son and daughter of god in the presence of god amen and amen now we are the sons of god not we will be right we are now we are redeemed oh this is it this whole quote right here just i was just so excited i could almost run through the building and scream jump on a pew or two we have satan's answer satan's always wanting an answer what about this what about this you did this what about this what about this we have satan's answer amen god has vindicated himself god has proved himself to his promise in this day can we say amen to that are we looking for the message to somehow be completed in our thinking no sir god's proven right the evidence is i will tell you over and over again sitting right here the evidence is not based in 1965 and previous the evidence is right here lives changed prayers answered holy ghost filled our children with no desire to go to the world they want to serve god my brother and sister that's god in our midst amen that's what he said he would do we have satan's answer god has vindicated himself god has proved himself to his promise in this day hallelujah the headship is here amen christ the risen lord is here in the same power of his resurrection that he ever was manifesting himself there's the devil's answer so when the devil starts crowing and hollering and whooping and whatever else just point him back pointing back yeah satan you're vindicating yourself out here you're producing a generation of neurotics and i would not speak against someone that would maybe be on some kind of medication don't don't misunderstand me but look at the spirit of the day when it's there that the doctors now during coven prescriptions for sedatives skyrocketed well if we had a little so to speak pedometer for prayer time i would hope that your prayer time skyrocketed amen world's falling apart lord god help these poor people that are going crazy praise the lord amen amen now look at this i'm going to just throw this out here sorry i'm not jabbing nobody but there's people that don't believe his presence are here they've told me that to my face you must be believe perusia that's false doctrine that's not right well let's go back saints before we move on the head ship is here who is that is that brother paul no okay christ amen the headship is here amen christ the risen lord is here i think it's pretty self-explanatory in the same power of his resurrection that he kind of sort of was at one point in time ever ever does it ever mean my brain just went ah what would be the ever of ever the only way we do is move all the way never of ever right because if it was ever of ever the only opposite paradox of that would be have ever and there's only three kinds of believers and even the make-believer williams believes he has power believes he's god see what i'm saying the devil's so tricky i i hope i'm not i'm i'm kind of stumbling on how to explain this to you see how tricky the devil is when he comes in and gets a message believer to say he's not here he's not here where are they going to move on the promise saints i'm talking doctrine i'm not picking on people i'm talking about that devil how he's trying to trick them by their own words not to expect much i tell you what i expect every promise every promise in the book is mine every chapter every verse every line amen i am living oh that's a tractor version anyway i'm living in his love divine cause jesus christ is mine hallelujah come on don't you believe me saints make me think i'm nuts or something there's the devil's answer satan you said this my lord said this not even going to argue with you i got it no even fight i'm not even going to fight with you i'll just stick with the word you stick with whatever you feel now amen amen john 14 14. let me just hurry along here if he shall ask anything in my name i will do it can we interpret that any other way is there an adjective and an adverb and um i don't know noun pronoun sorry for doing that i i've flunked all that stuff my family tried to get me to bring my vase we're moving and i found my little vase i made for my passing grade from art class remember i shared that with you we actually found that little vase and i'm telling you there was kids in our class that built these great big vases with the lip that poured you know rounded and big scrolled handles and all this stuff and miss braden said paul i'll give you a passing grade if you can simply get something off the pottery wheel i found it while we were moving it's about that tall it's about that big around it's not round but it looks it but it doesn't matter you might be more spiritual than me you might have more understanding than me but all i have to have is him paul doesn't need to impress you paul doesn't need to pre impress any other preacher any other person on this earth all i've got to do is please him that's right come on saints come on we get all caught up in how good we are and what we look like and comparing ourselves nonsense nonsense my brother and sister hallelujah because i can take you if you want to spend the time i can take you through the scripture and show you that those that god tries is those that he tries you might say in a deeper measure as those he has greater confidence look he opened the hedge to the devil completely to job but before it ever happens don't you know job after the fact was like man i wished i know god thought that about me thought i was a righteous man thought i was a a good man thought that it was so to speak none greater than me i wished i would have knowed that before this whole battle i would have went through it whole different but you see god's not going to treat you any differently treated job and he's telling the devil this is my bride she's the best of laodicea she's the best there is on the earth and you can't touch her hallelujah but we got an advantage saints we get to read the story of job and we're going to read all of the word and we get to realize god feels exactly the same way about you and i as he felt about job and so we ought to be standing up instead of whimpering and crying we ought to be standing up and saying lord i read the book i read my name in the book i know what your goal is i know what your desire is and i know who i am you see that was the key for esther when she stood there the chamberlain's the eunuchs the maids all of them are like oh you're making a mistake he'll cash you out this isn't how it works but she was there saying i know who i am not i hope to be his bride do you see where i'm at i'm not i hope to be the bride of christ we stand with the confidence the world calls it arrogance yeah i stood right there one time when a man speaking to another message guy says you guys are so arrogant yes sir you mistaken his arrogance i take it as confidence hallelujah i know i am the bride of christ i know my name is mrs jesus christ i'm not arrogant and i would stand in front of you it wouldn't take you people very long to look at my life and each one of you would say i see this little thing and brother paul i see this little thing and brother paul probably scare me how big a list you could have but as long as you're looking at me you're not looking at him and i'm looking at him so you go ahead and look at me while i look at him and i'll be who he wants me to be because he promised me i would be so i'm going to continue to look at him amen esther praise the lord here again i'm assuming okay is that okay can i assume for a moment i don't think esther was walking to meet the king my shoes look all right yes sir i have wrinkles no sir she did all of that before she got to him when she come to the king she had nothing but eyes for the king she come in there come on you can look at this in the natural but i want you to see it in the spiritual she wasn't looking around oh look [Music] no sir she walked in there she says that's my husband some call him king i call him husband and she had eyes for him and she didn't go up there saying i hope he reaches for the scepter i hope he reaches for the scepter i hope he reaches for the scepter neither should we be going i hope he hears my prayer i hope he hears my prayer i hope he hears my prayer knew who she was and we have the word in this hour we should know who we are because if we don't know who we are satan's going to buff at you and buff at you and buffet you and you'll be in and out and up and down and sideways my brother and sister we have enough word we have enough revealed word in this hour we know who we are hallelujah and when the devil says you can't be her it's like sorry he already called me sweetheart he already gave me his name he's already filled me with his nature his spirit his life i received his seed amen oh hallelujah here let me close this out amen oh hallelujah amen we can create that atmosphere saints it'll bring god right down in our midst amen you see let me just reiterate this i just feel led to reiterate this it's not our complaints it's not our whining it's not our crying it's our praise when esther walked out and he looked down there he was a man just like us brothers or men sisters i'll call you to the carpet here hope you don't mind i love you so much if your husband remembers the last words you spoke to him will he be built up or tore down can we get the rubber any plainer than that that's good king hazardous when he saw esther step into the court no wonder vashi left you no sir no no sir he looked down there and you remember those words so proud to be your wife i'm so happy you chose me amen when i come and offered myself into the court it's because i wanted with all of my heart to be your wife amen it wasn't like well if i'm not a wife to the king maybe he'll let me go over here and i'll marry this prince no sir and when he looked at her he saw this woman who was sold out she took his name she was sold out and she let him know how much i love you how much i appreciate how much i thank you for the life you've given me you hear my prayers i mean you hear my words come on amen because i can guarantee you if he'd married another vashti he'd have just left that scepter right there and he'd a letter walked up there and then he'd have told the chamberlains take her away come on amen i i you know brother david had like three sermons and i tried to cram them all into the same deal yeah now i'm struggling because somebody pushed the zip file and they're going bam blah blah blah blam and i got problems hallelujah conflict between god and satan and so here we are finish it the bride must be unified don't read no more stop there if all we took was those words right there the bride must be unified we've got everything under the sun believing everything under the sun preaching every weird thing under the sun and we've got an obligation to be unified with them some are peddling that come on i'm not complaining but i'm telling you i get peddled that way more often than you guys would even guess we're all one we're all bible believers message believers we should just all get together this should just all be the same so we could take that little chunk right there and justify that but look what he says here unified together by what the word the word you see there's no unity outside of the word amen i don't care what kind of programs and how fun they are we can sit around and say this was fun that's good my brother and sister but that's not unity [Music] my sheep hear my voice and this is his voice on printed word he's talking about the bible he wasn't holding up a message book all right unified by the word she makes herself ready not with a regular creed like esther when esther was to be chosen to stand before the king she didn't adorn her themselves with all the things but she adorned herself with a sweet i i told you earlier i didn't have this quote i do here it is adorned herself with a sweet meek spirit that's what the bride is adorning herself with with all the fruits of the spirit following amen well we want to we want to put all the fruits of the spirit up front and you know what praise the lord i i just you know i know i i treat everybody like a mad dog a chainsaw and a whatever but praise the lord i believe the message no sir meek contrite spirit are you listening paul haylett paul did you answer me what are we seeing in the mirror we should be seeing a nature change amen because if the old man still showing up isaac i'm going to tell on you buddy so they got him this cutest little fuzzy dog i mean i joked with him that's like one bite size for a coyote we were joking about their little dog it's a sweet little thing i have to admit and then isaac comes out of nowhere and he goes yeah you know brother brown said about the white dog black dog well you know they got this black lab that's about this big and they got a little white dog that's about that big and isaac got this just weird smirk on his face he says i guess you can see what we've been feeding [Laughter] i just thought that was humorous in the natural but saints let me go back to this in serious no we have every one of us proven that story that the prophet told what we feed is what we reflect all we have to do is feed on a negative spirit for one day and we are negative we feed on the holy spirit on the word of god and a lot of this goes away well you just don't know me i'm just naturally cranky oh well i just naturally know someone who changes nature amen i don't know if you can still find it or not it's burnt into my memory into my thinking brother gideon ratif 2007 cloverdale bible way missionary conference preaching i always call it the cycle breaker it has a little different breaking the cycle i think is the real title cycle breaker breaking the title something of that nature if you're struggling with your nature want you to go i'm pretty sure you could find it on their website my you know it's 2007 but they have quite extensive archive listen to that sermon we serve a god that doesn't cover over we don't serve a god that puts it in a closet and says just forget about it we serve a god amen that breaks that cycle our family is like this we're irish we're this we're that i serve a god who breaks that cycle changes that nature and fills it up with the holy ghost don't choose an excuse choose deliverance don't stand that because you see that's what the bride is adorning herself with not this world not religion christ amen could i go further king hazardous could no more rejected esther than he could have rejected himself christ can no more reject this bride he has called in this hour then he could come to that day and say i reject myself as a savior i reject myself as a healer i reject myself as a provider couldn't do it the devil wants you to think he's not going to provide for you the devil wants you to think he's not your healer the devil wants you to think he hasn't purchased your salvation but we have an answer for the devil amen hallelujah oh sister me if you would come saints thank you for your patience this morning amen you know i kept well praise the lord when you just have way too many rabbit trails way too many rabbit trails you run down them a little ways say whoa i can't go there gotta turn and run back hey man let's close it with this right here first peter 2 9 you know the scripture but ye are a chosen generation a royal priesthood a holy nation of peculiar people that's right you know one of the things
