[32:28] that
[32:30] hallelujah what a blessing it is to know
[32:32] that the lifter of our soul
[32:34] and you know some days you just have
[32:36] that kind of day but i would just ask
[32:38] you tonight that the lord raises a
[32:41] standard for you today
[32:43] amen he's faithful he's true he's
[32:45] present
[32:47] amen and i'm thankful you know sometimes
[32:49] you just have little things that happen
[32:52] and then you realize
[32:54] that the direction you were all worried
[32:56] about it going that god raised a
[32:58] standard right up and just changed it
[33:00] all and i say thank you tonight amen god
[33:04] bless each and every one of you
[33:06] amen sister sophie i had a lovely
[33:09] conversation with brother manasseh today
[33:12] thank you amen that was good hallelujah
[33:15] well it's just good to be here tonight
[33:17] and i want to speak to you
[33:20] on our continuing overall thought thank
[33:23] you
[33:24] beautiful music
[33:26] those songs
[33:28] actually touch very close to
[33:30] my thoughts today and
[33:32] i really appreciate the lord's anointing
[33:35] or leadership there
[33:36] amen we want to remember communion this
[33:39] coming sunday at five o'clock
[33:42] so i want to speak to you on present
[33:43] circumstance and and i see this as a
[33:46] bigger topic than i originally started
[33:48] into so i just simply named it being
[33:51] yoked
[33:52] i had a more specific title but realized
[33:55] there there is more scripture to that
[33:58] and
[33:59] and the part we're going to touch
[34:00] tonight
[34:01] is is uh beautiful
[34:04] but um you know there's there's another
[34:07] part of it right because the reality of
[34:09] it is is we're all going to be yoked to
[34:12] something
[34:13] and uh so we don't go through life
[34:15] unyoked and
[34:17] and uh we look at that and oftentimes
[34:19] take the scripture which we'll touch
[34:20] maybe lord willing in a future time but
[34:23] to be unequally yoked we look at that
[34:25] and oftentimes we we look at that but my
[34:28] brother and sister i would like to just
[34:30] uh put this out right now it's not you
[34:33] as it were in business with the wrong
[34:35] person it's not you married to the wrong
[34:37] person it's not you uh traveling doing
[34:40] living blah blah blah with the wrong
[34:42] person but my brother and sister to be
[34:45] unequally yoked would be us also as
[34:49] believers
[34:51] binding ourselves to things
[34:54] that are ungodly
[34:56] binding ourselves to things
[34:58] that
[34:59] don't edify
[35:01] right the scripture says
[35:03] to
[35:04] not even
[35:06] have the appearance of evil
[35:09] so we can find how satan would bind us
[35:11] sometimes because we would find
[35:13] ourselves yoked in something that an
[35:15] outsider as it were another brother
[35:17] another christian someone you've
[35:19] witnessed to would look at that and go
[35:21] that don't look good
[35:23] i don't look good and
[35:25] that's why the scripture calls on us to
[35:27] guard our testimony is a valuable
[35:30] it's a valuable price amen
[35:32] let's just stand this evening and um go
[35:36] into
[35:37] uh the scripture into galatians and
[35:40] we have a couple different scriptures
[35:43] out of galatians tonight but just to
[35:45] kind of take the root
[35:47] of what it is that we're speaking about
[35:50] um
[35:51] so this is paul speaking to the
[35:53] galatians and
[35:54] and he says then in
[35:56] the second chapter verse 1. he says then
[35:58] 14 years after
[36:01] i went up again to jerusalem
[36:04] with barnabas and took titus with me
[36:07] also
[36:08] and i went up by revelation
[36:11] now i have to admit saints i never ever
[36:14] caught this
[36:16] ever ever before in my life
[36:19] i've read this scripture many times
[36:22] he went up by revelation you know you
[36:24] know what happened when he went up by
[36:26] revelation
[36:27] he knew
[36:29] he knew
[36:31] what god was going to do
[36:34] he wasn't going up there surmising he
[36:36] wasn't hoping
[36:38] by revelation
[36:40] he knew
[36:43] you know i've always marveled about
[36:44] rahab there's all kinds of schemes that
[36:47] wicked minds have put
[36:51] but you see that's an anointing of the
[36:53] devil to try to insert the spirit of the
[36:55] day and the devil's thinking back into
[36:57] the word of god
[36:59] but i've often thought before how is it
[37:02] in a city of that size
[37:04] two spies come
[37:07] and go right to the very one
[37:09] that had a fear which we would recognize
[37:12] as reverence
[37:13] for the things of god
[37:15] right revelation
[37:17] revelation revealing
[37:20] that when she saw them she knew who they
[37:22] were people say well maybe they didn't
[37:25] quite get their clothing right
[37:27] maybe they didn't this right maybe they
[37:29] didn't that right but it's revelation
[37:33] it's revelation that brings us to those
[37:36] things
[37:38] and i went up by revelation and
[37:39] communicated unto them that gospel which
[37:42] i preach among the gentiles but
[37:45] privately to them which were of
[37:47] refutation
[37:48] lest by any means i should run or had
[37:51] run in vain
[37:53] but neither titus who was with me being
[37:56] a greek was compelled to be circumcised
[37:59] and that because of false brethren
[38:01] unawares brought in
[38:03] who came
[38:04] in privily to spy out our liberty which
[38:08] we have in christ jesus
[38:10] that they might bring us into bondage to
[38:14] whom we gave place by subjection
[38:18] no
[38:19] not for an hour
[38:21] isn't that beautiful we'll touch on a a
[38:24] little thought on that in just a bit no
[38:26] not for an hour that the truth of the
[38:29] gospel might continue with you
[38:32] look at this that means the gospel was
[38:34] already traveling with us if it's going
[38:36] to continue we already have the gospel
[38:39] of jesus christ amen we are moving
[38:42] forward amen thank you father lord we
[38:45] just ask for your help tonight just to
[38:47] express these things bubbling in our
[38:49] heart father that lord it could be just
[38:52] made alive to us lord and help us as we
[38:54] press to the mark of the high calling we
[38:57] ask this lord in every need lord prayer
[38:59] request that we might have forgotten
[39:01] those who are not able to be in the
[39:03] house of god tonight lord touch each one
[39:06] we pray in your name amen
[39:11] you may be seated hallelujah
[39:17] amen so here
[39:19] he's sharing that he is actually
[39:21] returning by revelation and so it's
[39:24] there my brother and sister not to say
[39:26] when he visited them previously there
[39:29] was not revelation but now he's coming
[39:32] with something that god has revealed to
[39:35] him right that is the revelation is a
[39:38] revelation of jesus christ it is the
[39:40] revelation of of
[39:42] our lord in our life it's a revelation
[39:45] of his word being made known to us and
[39:48] and you know revelation is interesting
[39:51] because through the years we might have
[39:53] key components but never put them
[39:55] together and then one day we pick up our
[39:57] bible and all of a sudden a passage of
[40:00] scripture
[40:02] suddenly takes on a new light to us and
[40:04] becomes so real to us in that context
[40:07] that we realize we've read over this can
[40:10] we say amen to that we've read over it
[40:13] for years but then it's by revelation
[40:15] and we could in an intellectual way say
[40:18] oh i finally caught that but it's
[40:20] actually god reveals that to us it's not
[40:23] just something that we just come and
[40:25] read in just the correct way or the
[40:27] right attitude or just in such a fashion
[40:31] or otherwise we would then by scholarly
[40:34] learning the prophet of god talks about
[40:36] that we don't just as teach one thing
[40:38] upon another until suddenly we have
[40:41] revelation it's the lord opening these
[40:44] things and i just recently had a
[40:46] situation as i was visiting with an
[40:48] individual and we got to talking about a
[40:51] certain scripture and i said and they
[40:53] said well i never did understand that
[40:55] scripture and you know you never want to
[40:58] come across arrogant because god has
[41:00] given that to us so you can't boast of
[41:03] the gift that god has given right we
[41:05] boast on christ not upon ourselves and
[41:08] so then you know it was interesting
[41:10] because i remember i just had this
[41:12] little spark of enthusiasm hit me
[41:14] because i was like i can and tie it
[41:17] together with the word of god explain
[41:20] that scripture to you and they're like
[41:22] wow you're excited about that and i'm
[41:23] like yes i am excited about that because
[41:26] it's been made real
[41:28] we're not just reading this same
[41:30] individual was saying about how that
[41:33] they'd fallen behind on reading the
[41:35] bible in a year and i i said just scrap
[41:38] that forget that nowhere in the
[41:41] scripture does it say you've got to read
[41:43] my word in its entirety every year what
[41:45] god wants us to do is read the word by
[41:48] revelation so that when we read the
[41:51] passage or the page or the verse or
[41:53] whatever it might be that it actually
[41:56] speaks to us
[41:57] now that's kind of like having a
[41:59] conversation and this happens in life
[42:01] you're in the house you're busy the wife
[42:03] goes one direction you're kind of going
[42:06] another but you're in a conversation and
[42:08] you realize then you've ventured into
[42:11] another room and you can hear them
[42:13] talking but you don't understand what
[42:15] they're saying
[42:17] we don't want that kind of relationship
[42:18] with the lord
[42:20] we've ventured into another room and we
[42:22] we don't understand what he's saying but
[42:24] we know he's speaking
[42:27] but we don't hear
[42:29] we don't comprehend
[42:30] we want revelation
[42:33] amen so as he goes here to the galatians
[42:37] he's telling them you know what i'm
[42:39] preaching the same gospel to them that i
[42:41] preached to the jews i'm preaching to
[42:43] the gentiles and so i don't have a two
[42:47] standard see this is a problem we have
[42:48] in the world today many of these
[42:50] religions believe they have a standard
[42:53] that they need to convert the jew to
[42:57] no my brother and sister when god
[42:59] ordains revelation the jews eyes will
[43:02] open
[43:04] but it's not here for us to teach them a
[43:06] new gospel because when we come with
[43:08] another gospel it leaves a question
[43:10] which one's right
[43:12] god has one word
[43:14] his original spoken word
[43:16] amen so he tells them i'm preaching this
[43:19] same gospel to them and i'm not doing it
[43:21] in respect of men in other words i
[43:23] didn't find just the right men to to
[43:26] preach this to in the sense of these men
[43:29] are are more respectable or they will be
[43:31] such but he says here i think i love
[43:34] this actually i think he said i went to
[43:37] them that were of reputation my brother
[43:39] and sister he didn't go to the religious
[43:41] scoundrel
[43:42] he didn't go to the guy that professed
[43:44] one thing and went out the next day and
[43:46] lived another he didn't profess or
[43:49] preach this gospel to the one who as it
[43:51] were would toss it aside and pick it up
[43:54] again at convenience but he was there
[43:57] speaking and when we're talking of a
[43:59] reputation he wasn't going down to the
[44:02] the uh the the courtyard and finding the
[44:05] men that everybody spoke of but he was
[44:07] talking in a spiritual context to men
[44:11] and women who loved the word of god men
[44:13] and women who wanted to serve god and
[44:16] desired more of him there's a reputation
[44:19] we want not to be known as a great man
[44:22] in the city as a great businessman as a
[44:24] great authority or even of wisdom but to
[44:27] be known amongst the community as a man
[44:31] of god that stands on the word and won't
[44:34] deviate from that word so he was looking
[44:37] for a different kind of reputation than
[44:40] the world wants the world wants amen
[44:42] well i don't want to get sidetracked
[44:44] here but the brother branham says the
[44:46] churches want the movers and the shakers
[44:49] we want those that are moving all right
[44:52] but not the shakers we don't need the
[44:54] shakers we don't need that in fact the
[44:55] prophet of god told us when the mayor
[44:57] starts going to your church you've got
[44:59] to be careful
[45:01] right kind of a pinnacle of political
[45:04] coming into a church you have to wonder
[45:06] can they really do what they do and be
[45:09] comfortable hearing the word of god
[45:11] preached
[45:14] so he says you know what look
[45:16] now we have to understand saints has it
[45:18] come in this time that that we look in
[45:21] the day that we live in now and we say
[45:23] it's too bad there's there's all kinds
[45:26] of little confrontations as it were and
[45:28] disputings and different opinions and
[45:31] all of this stuff but realize this has
[45:34] been going on
[45:35] forever
[45:37] this is not a 21st century it's not a
[45:40] message issue it is an issue amongst
[45:43] humanity and so it is here that as he is
[45:47] going to them and he's preaching to them
[45:49] and he's preaching the same gospel he's
[45:52] preaching it to reliable or solid people
[45:55] and he says you know what i don't want
[45:57] to should run or had run in vain we
[46:00] don't want to do this we're not here
[46:01] tonight having church just to have
[46:03] church right we're not here just because
[46:06] well this is what we do we're message
[46:08] believers we're supposed to go to church
[46:10] we're here tonight because we're looking
[46:12] for something that makes a difference
[46:15] we're looking for something that is
[46:17] strengthening us coming right down it's
[46:19] not an outside anointing although we
[46:21] feel it on the outside but i want this
[46:24] gospel to sink to the very morrow of my
[46:27] bones
[46:28] i wanted to sink down to the very core
[46:31] of the life of who i am so we are not
[46:35] running in vain
[46:37] amen this scripture says hey
[46:40] what does hinder you
[46:42] well brother david touched that on
[46:44] sunday usually what hinders us is us
[46:47] we can blame it on a lot of different
[46:48] people but really when it comes down to
[46:50] it then whatever they did will only
[46:53] impact you if you led it
[46:56] so we open the gate for our trojan horse
[47:01] and then wonder why we feel defeated
[47:04] when it's all over
[47:06] amen you see when i was growing up there
[47:08] was like give it the word test but their
[47:10] version of a word test just almost
[47:12] everybody failed it
[47:14] except for the chosen
[47:18] but you see my brother and sister the
[47:20] word test
[47:22] is actually the mirror of the word
[47:25] it's not me
[47:26] see this is interesting i i hope that
[47:28] you catch this the word test is not me
[47:32] taking the word down and holding it to
[47:34] you to test you but really honestly
[47:37] truly the word test is for me myself
[47:41] to look in the word and say where am i
[47:45] just had an interesting conversation
[47:46] with a young sister in the message
[47:49] just going through a kind of a hard spot
[47:51] in her life and and uh reached out and
[47:54] we're doing and you know my brother and
[47:56] sister it it struck me as as the lord
[47:58] just led what we was speaking to her uh
[48:01] you know
[48:03] it's each one of us is responsibility to
[48:06] give it the word test
[48:08] each one of us we say well do we have an
[48:11] answer i want to ask you this question
[48:13] you can say yes or no or however you nod
[48:15] your head or whatever but do we have the
[48:18] answer for the spirit of laodicea
[48:23] absolutely we do
[48:25] there should be no i don't know i might
[48:28] we have the answer
[48:30] we have met satan's challenge by the
[48:33] word and we have the answer for the
[48:36] questions of our day
[48:38] so just as it is as any student
[48:41] now i'm assuming every one of us went to
[48:43] school at some form and in other words
[48:45] i'm admitting i'm probably the least
[48:47] educated here
[48:50] but to do well on the test you had to
[48:52] study you had to dig in right
[48:54] now some people are so intelligent they
[48:56] just absorb it and can regurgitate it
[48:58] but some of us had to pound it i
[49:00] remember in history years ago i had a
[49:03] teacher that was just a very good
[49:05] teacher in one synth but you know way
[49:07] too focused on dates it's like okay what
[49:10] happened on blah blah date and i'm like
[49:12] i don't know but that was like 222 years
[49:15] ago and i don't know that whatever
[49:17] happened on that day really is going to
[49:19] matter to me today because i'm sitting
[49:21] in history being asked a question i have
[49:24] no answer for
[49:26] but the answer is available
[49:29] and that teacher was unrelenting
[49:31] it was in the book
[49:33] if you had done your duty
[49:36] you would know
[49:38] the answer
[49:39] are you with me tonight
[49:41] and so we have no excuse because the
[49:43] answers are in the book
[49:45] amen the answer to satan's question is
[49:48] in the book
[49:50] amen
[49:51] so we look at this he preached not as a
[49:53] respecter of men but he was preaching
[49:55] the same gospel the same jesus christ
[49:59] the same yesterday today and forever and
[50:02] as he was what was he doing he was
[50:04] preaching in a way that shed the true
[50:06] light of the gospel to the galatians and
[50:10] so as we look through history we
[50:11] recognize that there in galatia there
[50:15] was many men that were saying well you
[50:17] know if you're going to receive this uh
[50:19] you need to be circumcised you can't be
[50:22] saved unless you're circumcised so you
[50:24] have to come and conform and and it was
[50:27] a doctrine i mean think about the
[50:29] churches in the world today uh what we
[50:31] would call our world my brother and
[50:33] sister there's people there's message
[50:35] churches that you are not supposed to
[50:37] come to church unless you have a white
[50:39] shirt and a black tie
[50:42] i don't know where they got the they got
[50:44] that it could be maybe they come out of
[50:46] mormonism
[50:48] i don't know
[50:49] but there's that's something they place
[50:51] in there and churches that have this
[50:53] little thing we don't want to waste time
[50:55] on that but this little thing and you
[50:56] need to conform or churches that are all
[50:59] we have a great man in our midst and so
[51:01] we're all going to look to this man and
[51:03] you need to kind of give submission as
[51:05] it were subjugation to this man because
[51:08] he's one with revelation but that's not
[51:10] what the gospel says
[51:12] we have one that we raise up and that is
[51:15] our lord jesus christ and revelation
[51:18] flows from him into the body severally
[51:21] it's not at one channel but god sharing
[51:24] it as a licks of fire coming down in the
[51:26] upper room it wasn't a great bolt of
[51:29] lightning that just struck and and those
[51:31] that were close to it got more than the
[51:33] other that holy spirit amen and i say
[51:35] that holy spirit speaking in the context
[51:37] of in the past tense that holy spirit
[51:40] moved in the midst of those people and
[51:43] when they walked out of there they had
[51:44] the holy ghost not a fraction not a
[51:47] judgment you've got 62 percent you've
[51:50] got 78 percent but they received the
[51:52] baptism of the holy ghost and we're not
[51:54] here today to try to determine as it
[51:57] would be that god's going to give this
[51:59] much to this one and this much to this
[52:01] one everyone that diligently seeks the
[52:04] word of god and his presence the holy
[52:07] spirit will receive the baptism of the
[52:09] holy ghost it is not a partial it's not
[52:12] a deal if we diligently see now the
[52:14] issue coming back are we digging in the
[52:16] book are we finding
[52:19] the answer
[52:21] for laodicea
[52:23] are we finding the answer for the 21st
[52:25] century
[52:27] so you see it's there
[52:29] he preached in such a way that it shed
[52:31] the true light of the gospel but men
[52:34] were coming in there and and bringing
[52:36] divisions trying to separate the
[52:38] galatians and you know it was the great
[52:40] debate of circumcision or not
[52:44] and to put in a context
[52:46] hope this is not offensive to anyone
[52:49] to bring it to our day it might be the
[52:51] great debate of the seals open or not
[52:54] divides churches divides family divides
[52:57] friendships and that's what was
[52:59] happening the same spirit of division
[53:02] was there in galatia at that time
[53:05] trying to separate the people and some
[53:08] say well you know it's because of this
[53:10] and some they preach too hard and they
[53:12] preach too lenient but we don't like the
[53:15] preacher in the middle either so it's
[53:17] there that they they're trying to find
[53:19] their place and sometimes you'll notice
[53:21] i've been there i've witnessed this that
[53:23] you'll be in certain parts of the world
[53:26] and they have a very present revelation
[53:30] you've got to believe this you've got to
[53:32] see this like this
[53:34] and you know it's interesting
[53:36] and to say the least in the flesh
[53:39] knowing
[53:40] that sometimes their great revelation is
[53:42] something that god's revealed as it were
[53:44] to us as a body
[53:46] a year two five ago and now they've just
[53:48] made it the latest greatest revelation
[53:51] and you know it's just hard to to get
[53:54] too excited about that because they're
[53:56] trying to put something to you that you
[53:59] need to now this is the point i'm really
[54:01] trying to make you need to tell them
[54:05] they want to hear you acknowledge
[54:11] but what if your acknowledgement is yes
[54:12] they've been preaching that
[54:15] for several years now
[54:18] they don't like
[54:22] that circumcised in the flesh
[54:27] if you're going to get saved by this
[54:29] gospel of jesus christ you've got to be
[54:30] circumcised in the flesh
[54:34] what a doctrine
[54:36] but i'll tell you where they missed it
[54:40] we have to be circumcised in the spirit
[54:43] there's where the circumcision takes
[54:45] place is not in the physical realm but
[54:48] it takes place in the spiritual realm
[54:51] and they had missed that key element and
[54:53] so they were trying to enforce the
[54:55] gospel on the flesh i hope you catch
[54:58] this tonight and we're not here to
[55:00] enforce the gospel on the flesh we're
[55:02] here tonight to enforce the gospel as it
[55:05] were on the spirit man we're here
[55:07] tonight not to try and make the flesh
[55:10] man some perfect image of something the
[55:13] word says the flesh man will fail
[55:16] and god did not even save our flesh
[55:18] hallelujah you promised us a whole new
[55:20] body on the other side we're not taking
[55:22] some reformed or reformation of the body
[55:25] my brother and sister but the spirit
[55:27] that's being molded in you and i the
[55:29] character of the gospel of jesus christ
[55:32] is what we will take with us that is who
[55:34] we are and i say thank you lord man i'm
[55:37] not here tonight to circumcise my flesh
[55:40] just as i made statements to you before
[55:42] we can preach against sin sin sin sin
[55:45] but if we'll get the holy ghost within
[55:48] the sin will have to leave and if we are
[55:51] beating against the sin we are just
[55:54] fighting against the tide of the day we
[55:56] live in but you ever get from now a
[55:59] hundred i don't know maybe we don't put
[56:01] a limit 150 down to two or whatever it
[56:04] might be you get the holy ghost in there
[56:06] and you won't have to worry about the
[56:08] effect of laodicea
[56:10] but you see we can beat against don't do
[56:12] this and don't do this and don't do this
[56:14] and it will still happen that's the day
[56:16] we're living in i could share some very
[56:18] interesting things that a brother just
[56:20] shared with me maybe i'll just give you
[56:22] a glimpse of that uh in another
[56:24] continent
[56:25] a youth camp and the minister that was
[56:27] preaching there wanted to just kind of
[56:29] get a feeling for for uh what was
[56:32] happening there what was the the
[56:34] situation of the young people in that
[56:36] camp and he put out a little anonymous
[56:38] as it were would that be right anyway a
[56:40] little questionnaire that no
[56:42] identification no names nobody knows who
[56:45] wrote what and he was they were stunned
[56:49] i won't go into it tonight but they were
[56:51] stunned
[56:52] but what these children these young
[56:53] people admitted was happening in their
[56:55] life they were stunned they weren't just
[56:57] like oh that's too bad i'm talking about
[57:00] they read this and they were shocked
[57:03] of what the young people were dealing
[57:05] with
[57:12] do we preach to those young people and
[57:14] tell them how terrible they are
[57:19] or do we remind them
[57:22] this is satan
[57:25] this is what he does
[57:28] this is how he does it
[57:30] doesn't sound very spiritual is it when
[57:32] we come back and start as it were
[57:34] putting up the whole platform
[57:37] to show
[57:38] this is satan
[57:41] now i want to put this in this context a
[57:43] little ahead of my notes here but i
[57:44] loved what brother david said on sunday
[57:46] and that sometimes he didn't just put it
[57:48] to like you bad people or you whatever
[57:50] but sometimes we go a certain way and
[57:53] we've already turned to go that way i
[57:55] don't remember the exact words that you
[57:56] put that in brother david but we turn
[57:58] and we start to go that way and then we
[58:00] recognize that's the devil and we have
[58:02] to turn and then flee from that
[58:05] see we're not exempt as though we're so
[58:07] spiritual to never be tricked by the
[58:10] devil but there's something in common
[58:12] with the believer and that is that they
[58:14] are not no not for an hour
[58:18] going to be in subjection to that not
[58:20] for a season will they be in subjection
[58:22] we flee back to the one who is our
[58:24] refuge
[58:26] amen can someone say a real hearty amen
[58:29] to that that's what god does but you see
[58:31] satan comes and tries to make a young
[58:34] people or old people or whatever feel
[58:36] like they're just nothing because they
[58:38] actually turned and took a step in that
[58:42] direction
[58:43] you remember when brother david did that
[58:45] i don't know if he even remembers
[58:46] exactly what it was but i like how he
[58:49] actually acted that out he took that out
[58:51] of there and these things and you step
[58:53] into that
[58:55] and then you're shocked
[58:56] that's the devil
[59:00] we don't hunker down negotiate
[59:03] we don't say let's let's come up with an
[59:05] excuse of why i did
[59:08] i'm not talking about excuse to make us
[59:10] look good but an excuse to kind of
[59:12] circumvent
[59:14] the emotions which usually is
[59:16] condemnation to deal with this
[59:23] but you see
[59:25] that's not
[59:27] neither titus who is with me being greek
[59:30] you see paul preached this in such a
[59:32] fashion saints
[59:34] paul
[59:35] preached it
[59:37] in such
[59:38] a fashion
[59:41] the titus
[59:43] catching the revelation also
[59:46] says me a greek
[59:48] i do not need
[59:50] to go get
[59:51] circumcised
[59:54] this gospel is not about the flesh
[59:58] this gospel is about
[1:00:01] christ like
[1:00:03] the nature of god
[1:00:05] the image of god the life
[1:00:08] of god
[1:00:10] there's the difference my brother and
[1:00:11] sister you see
[1:00:13] so then it's not by the church or by
[1:00:15] certain preachers but by the gospel
[1:00:17] amen so you know these these uh false
[1:00:20] brethren brought in
[1:00:22] they come and and i just was struck in
[1:00:25] my heart they come to spy out now do you
[1:00:28] read those words with me
[1:00:32] can someone
[1:00:33] read or tell me what the possessive
[1:00:36] of that sentence is
[1:00:43] our
[1:00:45] liberty
[1:00:48] it's not
[1:00:49] someone else's liberty
[1:00:51] you see god even transferred it as a
[1:00:53] liberty from him and he's already given
[1:00:56] to the people and now they can take
[1:00:59] possession of it and say this is my
[1:01:01] liberty amen can you say that tonight
[1:01:04] that we have come into the word god has
[1:01:07] dealt in our lives we have been filled
[1:01:09] with his spirit he has given us victory
[1:01:11] we can live victorious lives and we do
[1:01:14] that and so this is no longer just some
[1:01:16] words on a page but this is my liberty
[1:01:19] it's our liberty my brother and sister
[1:01:21] that the devil is stealing it's one
[1:01:23] thing to look in it and i've done this
[1:01:25] before and wished i'd have done
[1:01:26] something different jerry and i went to
[1:01:28] a restaurant and and as we were walking
[1:01:30] out this young man went by all of their
[1:01:33] silverware with the napkin rolled up
[1:01:35] around it cloth napkin no less and the
[1:01:37] kid just pockets i don't know one or two
[1:01:39] of them and walks out and i look back
[1:01:41] after the fact and i said you know what
[1:01:43] i should have called that kid out
[1:01:48] but you know what i did
[1:01:50] at the moment right there i just had a
[1:01:51] lovely evening with my wife it's like
[1:01:54] i'm not going to spoil my evening it's
[1:01:56] not my knife and fork and it's not going
[1:01:57] to break them
[1:02:01] that apathetic
[1:02:03] reaction
[1:02:04] is how satan comes in
[1:02:07] and steals our liberty
[1:02:11] so he got jay's liberty it's not my
[1:02:13] liberty
[1:02:15] they'll recover
[1:02:17] no my brother and sister it's our
[1:02:19] liberty
[1:02:20] that is in a plural sense and it's
[1:02:22] possessive
[1:02:24] so it's our liberty that we're fighting
[1:02:26] for see and they're coming to spy out
[1:02:28] our liberty which we have not in
[1:02:31] ourselves not in our church but in
[1:02:33] christ jesus and their whole purpose
[1:02:35] amen just listening to a brother
[1:02:37] minister and and i might just preach on
[1:02:40] this i told jerry i'm going to
[1:02:41] plagiarize some of that that's good i'm
[1:02:42] not going to tell you who it is so you
[1:02:44] can't spy out my plagiarism
[1:02:48] but he said every time the devil comes
[1:02:52] he has an agenda
[1:02:55] he doesn't come just to torment you
[1:02:57] he doesn't come just to annoy you
[1:03:00] he has an agenda
[1:03:03] and every preacher of the gospel that
[1:03:06] stands behind a pulpit has an agenda too
[1:03:09] and we don't need to hide it it isn't
[1:03:10] like we need to keep this the wording
[1:03:12] had somebody one time say uh you know um
[1:03:14] boy i don't know i was really excited
[1:03:17] brother paul that you used the word uh
[1:03:18] manipulation or manipulator that just
[1:03:21] doesn't sound good and i said well it
[1:03:23] sounds good or not it's their truth go
[1:03:25] back to the definition find the
[1:03:27] definition and i'm telling you every
[1:03:29] preacher of this gospel is a manipulator
[1:03:32] trying to put people into a position
[1:03:34] they don't even know they want to be in
[1:03:41] but how close is it
[1:03:44] to turn into
[1:03:46] causing you to do something
[1:03:48] that is harmful
[1:03:50] that you don't want to see how close
[1:03:53] prophet of god said those two spirits
[1:03:54] would be so close they deceived the very
[1:03:56] elect if it was possible
[1:03:59] and i speak this boldly and i speak this
[1:04:01] openly that as it were not in the
[1:04:02] context we normally think of like
[1:04:04] manipulator but i'm telling my brother
[1:04:06] and sister if i could put every one of
[1:04:08] us in the rapture right now i would do
[1:04:10] it but god's got a better plan
[1:04:14] he doesn't have paul's plan he's got a
[1:04:16] better plan
[1:04:17] he doesn't need paul to try and do the
[1:04:19] work so what do we do yes we as
[1:04:22] preachers kind of tend to manipulate
[1:04:23] things otherwise we would just randomly
[1:04:25] throw out quotes and scriptures and
[1:04:27] thoughts and ideas but what do we do we
[1:04:29] try to lead that down a path pointing to
[1:04:32] a conclusion can we say amen to that it
[1:04:34] makes sense amen that we don't just
[1:04:36] throw out random you know let's turn to
[1:04:38] john 1. let's go to revelation 13. let's
[1:04:40] go to you know this and here and go down
[1:04:42] there and this stuff that's not even
[1:04:44] connected we have a plan we're we're
[1:04:46] moving in a coordinated fashion pointing
[1:04:48] to an end result and so it's there you
[1:04:51] see it was there that that he's
[1:04:53] preaching to them in such a fashion that
[1:04:56] titus being a fellow brother is not even
[1:04:59] moved on by some kind of guilt or shame
[1:05:02] or whatever insecurity to be circumcised
[1:05:05] because he knows what it is and that's
[1:05:08] how we should and we do our best to
[1:05:10] preach the gospel that they come in to
[1:05:13] spy out our liberty and the devil my
[1:05:16] brother and sister the prophet of god
[1:05:17] said the devil knows you better than you
[1:05:19] know yourself
[1:05:20] what's he doing he's spying out your
[1:05:23] life to come and try to set something in
[1:05:26] your path a stone of stumbling to set
[1:05:29] something in your path that shakes your
[1:05:31] world and your focus then comes on to
[1:05:34] this stone of stumbling it comes on to a
[1:05:36] circumstance it comes on to a
[1:05:38] relationship as it were a friendship or
[1:05:41] whatever it might be or something with
[1:05:43] more friction and and we focus on that
[1:05:46] and we're not focused on christ he don't
[1:05:48] care about those other things he's
[1:05:50] coming to steal our liberty
[1:05:53] he's coming to rob us from our focus on
[1:05:57] jesus christ amen so there's where our
[1:05:59] liberty is that they can bring us into
[1:06:01] bondage
[1:06:02] my my brother and sister i mean look
[1:06:04] what's going on in the world around us
[1:06:07] venezuela i know many brothers from
[1:06:09] there
[1:06:12] it all started so
[1:06:14] good
[1:06:16] never pay another doctor bill
[1:06:20] we're going to do this for you
[1:06:23] we're going to do that for you
[1:06:26] now
[1:06:27] even right down to the believers rejoice
[1:06:29] and thank god for just a little tube of
[1:06:31] toothpaste
[1:06:33] and when grocery stores open in the
[1:06:35] morning what is on the shelf will be
[1:06:37] gone
[1:06:38] in less time than it takes the next 25
[1:06:41] people
[1:06:42] to make it through the door
[1:06:45] see how clever satan is
[1:06:47] but look at the world we're living in
[1:06:49] right now
[1:06:50] dual-fold meaning of the scripture the
[1:06:52] scripture tells us we're coming into a
[1:06:53] season of famine
[1:06:55] and we'll look right now that they're
[1:06:57] they're now declaring more and more it's
[1:06:59] definitely in the farm world it's being
[1:07:01] it's being spoken that in the present
[1:07:04] state of conditions in the direction
[1:07:05] things are going we are going to have a
[1:07:08] global
[1:07:09] food storage a shortage i mean
[1:07:12] a global food shortage
[1:07:16] but what the prophet come along and say
[1:07:19] it's not going to be about natural food
[1:07:22] it's going to be about spiritual food so
[1:07:25] what happens god allows the parallel my
[1:07:27] brother and sister we can fill our
[1:07:29] pantry we can fill the basement we can
[1:07:31] fill the attic we can do all of that
[1:07:33] thing but if we are starving to death if
[1:07:36] our spiritual relationship has been
[1:07:40] stolen from us and we are now in bondage
[1:07:43] to a system that has fear it has anger
[1:07:46] it has bitterness has all of these
[1:07:48] things what has he done he doesn't have
[1:07:50] to take the
[1:07:51] face away from you you can still say i'm
[1:07:54] a
[1:07:54] christian he's not going to take that
[1:07:57] away from you
[1:07:58] i've just been studying satan's eden and
[1:08:00] it's just this just knocking my socks
[1:08:02] off because it's there that you look at
[1:08:04] this and what is happening today is so
[1:08:07] clearly mapped out right there in that
[1:08:09] message it is powerful my brother and
[1:08:12] sister and you look at this and realize
[1:08:14] that what have they done they've spied
[1:08:16] out the liberty
[1:08:21] and people are in bondage and don't even
[1:08:26] know it
[1:08:28] imagine
[1:08:30] we in america the land of the free
[1:08:34] are some of the most bound people
[1:08:37] on the face of the earth
[1:08:40] we're bound in our materialism we're
[1:08:41] bound in our religious spirits we're
[1:08:43] bound in so many things i don't need to
[1:08:46] explain all of that to you tonight amen
[1:08:48] so what are they doing they're trying to
[1:08:51] take our liberty which we have that
[1:08:54] means it is past tense it is possessive
[1:08:58] we have the liberty my brother and
[1:09:00] sister come on somebody lift a hand and
[1:09:02] say i have liberty and the devil is here
[1:09:05] tonight to steal that from you
[1:09:08] he's here tonight by the thinking of our
[1:09:11] own mind and we could say well i see it
[1:09:13] like this and i see it like this i say
[1:09:16] let's pray in this fashion lord let thy
[1:09:19] will be my will
[1:09:22] and my will be thy will
[1:09:25] otherwise we come into a place that it's
[1:09:27] like well it has to be this and it has
[1:09:30] to be this forget about what you're
[1:09:32] thinking and come back in that position
[1:09:35] and say lord one of my greatest desires
[1:09:37] in life is that my will and thy will are
[1:09:40] perfectly meshed together now when we
[1:09:43] see it we don't see two separate
[1:09:45] entities we don't see two different
[1:09:47] trains of thought that merge here and
[1:09:49] merge there but have places of
[1:09:51] separation but we come because we have
[1:09:55] if we was to wipe out all of the rest of
[1:09:58] this in front of this my brother and
[1:09:59] sister you could easily in those
[1:10:01] sentences come to the conclusion that we
[1:10:04] already have liberty
[1:10:05] that has already been granted to us as
[1:10:08] sons and daughters of god and now our
[1:10:10] job is not to find liberty you say
[1:10:13] brother paul i've been down trodden i've
[1:10:15] been beaten on stop
[1:10:17] the prophet of god said how do you know
[1:10:19] that god wants to heal you because he
[1:10:22] said so how do you know god wants to
[1:10:24] give you the holy ghost because he said
[1:10:27] so how do you know that god wants you to
[1:10:29] have a life full of joy and happiness
[1:10:32] because he said so
[1:10:35] and i'm not talking about frivolous type
[1:10:37] joy and happiness i'm talking about that
[1:10:40] security down in the soul that just
[1:10:42] makes us as humans happy to know my lord
[1:10:45] loves me he has saved me i'm written in
[1:10:48] the lamb's book of life it's his own
[1:10:50] blood he poured over me
[1:10:53] amen that kind of a joy and happiness
[1:10:56] but you see that's already been given to
[1:10:58] us
[1:11:00] it's time for us to defend it
[1:11:03] time for us to take a hold of what god
[1:11:05] has already given
[1:11:06] he promised if we'd be baptized
[1:11:09] now it's not some simple formula some
[1:11:11] people say well i was baptized and i
[1:11:13] this and then i should have the holy
[1:11:14] ghost i just claim i got it my brother
[1:11:16] and sister god requires
[1:11:18] our contribution
[1:11:20] now see some people say no no we don't
[1:11:22] have yes we do
[1:11:24] you have to make sure you don't just get
[1:11:25] baptized you've got to repent
[1:11:28] amen and you can do all the repentant
[1:11:30] you want if you don't get baptized
[1:11:33] or if your baptism is twisted
[1:11:35] you see what i'm saying god has a
[1:11:37] requirement on our part
[1:11:39] amen otherwise you know the world and
[1:11:41] that's one of the traps that satan has
[1:11:43] given to them they all just say well i
[1:11:45] believe therefore i have
[1:11:47] no there's there's a we're not works my
[1:11:49] brother and sister but there is a
[1:11:51] portion that god wants us to take and
[1:11:55] much of that that's not very good
[1:11:57] english is it
[1:11:59] most of that there's the right words
[1:12:02] comes by us submitting to the word
[1:12:09] you know he said
[1:12:13] understand it all and thou shalt be
[1:12:15] saved
[1:12:17] no see it's not that way
[1:12:20] so you see it's telling us and and you
[1:12:22] know if we have struggles and this was
[1:12:24] very helpful to me today really spoke to
[1:12:26] my heart to whom we gave place by
[1:12:28] subjection
[1:12:31] no
[1:12:33] if we could by paul's way of doing
[1:12:35] english and paul writing notes there
[1:12:36] would be i'm real fond if any of you i
[1:12:38] ever text any of you you'll see this i'm
[1:12:41] really fun forget about all that formal
[1:12:43] dot dot dot works really good and the
[1:12:45] more emphasis you want just put more
[1:12:47] dots
[1:12:48] you really want to emphasize something
[1:12:49] just do a whole line full of dots
[1:12:53] but you see
[1:12:54] to whom we gave a place by subjection
[1:12:58] this could have about 50 dots
[1:13:01] no
[1:13:03] i'm not going to yield to the devil
[1:13:05] no i'm not going to let those thoughts
[1:13:07] come down and rest in my mind no i'm not
[1:13:11] going to take this satan's opinion i was
[1:13:13] asked to take a little poll today
[1:13:16] you know how good did we do
[1:13:23] you know if you can't do it honestly
[1:13:24] just don't do it i started doing their
[1:13:26] poll and i was like
[1:13:28] you guys have the worst service on the
[1:13:30] face of the earth i finally just deleted
[1:13:31] the whole poll because it's like i'm
[1:13:34] sorry i just can't do this
[1:13:36] but you see
[1:13:38] we're not called
[1:13:39] to yield to the devil
[1:13:41] not for an hour
[1:13:45] i'm telling you we see people that have
[1:13:47] bitterness
[1:13:50] and they have to stop and think how long
[1:13:53] they go i was dealing with a this has
[1:13:56] been back quite a few years not even in
[1:13:57] our church in a whole nother church
[1:13:59] somebody come up to the altar in a
[1:14:00] service
[1:14:01] they said i have a spirit of bitterness
[1:14:03] and i just asked him how long have you
[1:14:05] been carrying this
[1:14:08] they named a date and i was like
[1:14:11] okay
[1:14:12] i think 16 years
[1:14:15] is too long
[1:14:18] but what happens
[1:14:19] something reinforces it
[1:14:24] they don't like me
[1:14:26] and you go to church and someone's mind
[1:14:28] is so preoccupied they walk by
[1:14:31] there's the proof
[1:14:33] and the root
[1:14:35] keeps growing
[1:14:37] yeah
[1:14:39] so what does it do
[1:14:40] we're not gonna saints we're not even
[1:14:42] gonna give an hour
[1:14:44] that hurt what they said hurt
[1:14:47] in an hour okay if i could just bind you
[1:14:49] as it were to this in an hour you before
[1:14:52] that hour's up you're gonna stop and say
[1:14:54] lord forgive them and forgive me
[1:14:57] if they meant it lord forgive them
[1:14:58] anyhow and lord forgive me for taking
[1:15:01] offense because i'm not going to let the
[1:15:04] hour
[1:15:04] pass by
[1:15:06] i'm not going to let it take root in my
[1:15:09] life
[1:15:14] i believe as the last year brother jason
[1:15:16] farmed with us
[1:15:18] we had a tremendous rainstorm and it
[1:15:20] washed a big rut down through a field
[1:15:24] i mean a big rut
[1:15:28] so we took a groundhog doesn't matter
[1:15:30] what that is it's just a
[1:15:32] groundhog
[1:15:36] and we went out there and we went over
[1:15:37] and over and over and over on that spot
[1:15:39] until we filled in that big rut and that
[1:15:41] wash and we got it all smoothed in and
[1:15:43] you could see all of our sweeps and our
[1:15:45] turns around but you know what taught me
[1:15:48] a lesson was when the corn came up
[1:15:52] everywhere we had worked that soil at
[1:15:54] that late moment
[1:15:56] there was no weeds
[1:15:58] so it told me that even while it looked
[1:16:00] like bare dirt in our life can you just
[1:16:03] bear with me on this where it looked
[1:16:04] like bare dirt i'm not offended the seed
[1:16:07] was taking root and when we come through
[1:16:10] with the groundhog we disturbed all of
[1:16:13] that soil and so everywhere we fixed
[1:16:15] that rut was absolutely the cleanest
[1:16:17] place in the whole field the whole
[1:16:19] season
[1:16:21] god come and let the word just run over
[1:16:23] us
[1:16:24] let the words sweep around and around
[1:16:26] and around and stir our lives and stir
[1:16:29] us up and maybe sometimes hard preaching
[1:16:31] we we kind of push back against that
[1:16:33] that was hard but let it come and work
[1:16:36] the soil of our soul than any kind of
[1:16:39] root of bitterness and anything in us
[1:16:42] would be tore up and disturbed and you
[1:16:44] couldn't see a single one of those weeds
[1:16:49] but the proof was that they were there
[1:16:54] i'm not offended
[1:16:57] if that's so
[1:16:59] it won't come back
[1:17:02] are you with me
[1:17:04] it won't come back
[1:17:07] so look at this
[1:17:09] because these false brethren
[1:17:12] they came in unawares
[1:17:16] to bring us back into bondage
[1:17:19] my brother and sister i want to put it
[1:17:20] this way this is just something that
[1:17:22] that had just spoke to my heart when i
[1:17:24] was studying this
[1:17:26] what would bondage be for you and i are
[1:17:28] we going to go back and be catholics
[1:17:32] i'm not speaking ill of anybody but you
[1:17:34] know that little church out yonder that
[1:17:35] we've kind of made claim on in the
[1:17:37] country that's got the nice lawn out
[1:17:39] there you know all by itself
[1:17:42] we're driving to church tonight
[1:17:44] sister jerry and i some comment between
[1:17:46] us and she looked it up and
[1:17:48] you know what that church is
[1:17:51] it's catholic by another name
[1:17:55] they have the same tenants
[1:17:57] the same ritual the same tradition and
[1:18:00] on their website they declare all of
[1:18:01] that
[1:18:03] it even has the word catholic
[1:18:05] in their website
[1:18:08] now what kind of seed is that going to
[1:18:10] produce a catholic
[1:18:13] by another name
[1:18:15] because that is the seed
[1:18:18] oh my brother and sister let us not take
[1:18:20] the name of the message and produce
[1:18:22] another seed
[1:18:23] let us take the name of the message and
[1:18:25] produce the seed that this message was
[1:18:28] and that was jesus christ
[1:18:30] let it produce what it's supposed to
[1:18:32] produce amen that the truth of the
[1:18:35] gospel might continue
[1:18:37] with
[1:18:38] you hallelujah
[1:18:41] now look at this just want to say here
[1:18:44] uh
[1:18:45] i touched on this already of what i was
[1:18:47] just really i had this wrote down
[1:18:49] uh uh
[1:18:51] you know we can step into something and
[1:18:53] realize the devil's in it
[1:18:55] don't just go ahead and say well i
[1:18:57] started i guess i'll finish
[1:19:00] no
[1:19:00] flee from that the scripture says flee
[1:19:02] from the very appearance of evil
[1:19:04] flee from anything that when when the
[1:19:06] devil says aha i got you then start
[1:19:09] repenting you'll break the power of
[1:19:11] satan right there no matter what it is
[1:19:13] you say well i already oh i already fell
[1:19:16] repent it'll break the power of satan
[1:19:18] right there in that moment
[1:19:20] he become powerless in your life on that
[1:19:23] amen don't give not even for an hour
[1:19:26] amen so look at this this gospel right
[1:19:28] we know it i'm not preaching nothing new
[1:19:31] it's continuing in the bride of christ
[1:19:33] we are the continuation of the book of
[1:19:35] acts and i believe if we could ever
[1:19:37] truly catch that revelation saints that
[1:19:40] it would take a lot of trouble out of
[1:19:41] our life i am the product of an upper
[1:19:44] room experience you say brother paul
[1:19:47] you've never been in that upper room no
[1:19:49] god gave me my own upper room amen
[1:19:52] that's how much god loves us in the day
[1:19:54] that we're living in he gave us our own
[1:19:57] upper room he gave us our own backside
[1:20:00] of the desert he gave us our own closet
[1:20:03] he gave us however you want to word it
[1:20:05] he gave us our own place to have that
[1:20:07] personal experience and so i don't need
[1:20:10] to travel through time back to an upper
[1:20:12] room because i have by the word the
[1:20:15] experience of the upper room i have the
[1:20:17] same anointing the same revelation of
[1:20:20] the upper room hallelujah amen so
[1:20:24] what are we ordained to do
[1:20:30] how's that song go brother jason by the
[1:20:33] fruit
[1:20:34] of our lips
[1:20:36] and the blood
[1:20:38] of the lamb
[1:20:40] what is our confession is it in conflict
[1:20:42] with the blood
[1:20:44] see that ought to be something you know
[1:20:46] brother brown says don't don't
[1:20:47] uh speak the devil's language
[1:20:50] i can't grasp the whole quote right in
[1:20:52] my mind right at the moment i'll i'll
[1:20:53] butcher it if i repeat it but you know
[1:20:57] my brother and sister that's that's not
[1:20:59] worse out we're not called we're not
[1:21:01] ordained or anointed amen to speak
[1:21:04] defeat we're not ordained or anointed to
[1:21:07] say well this is the best that i can do
[1:21:09] my brother and sister we're anointed
[1:21:12] ordained of god not to fail
[1:21:15] that's where our ordination that's where
[1:21:17] we are ordained us not to fail
[1:21:20] amen what is it i i going back to what
[1:21:22] some of the things brother stephen spoke
[1:21:24] at camp amen called to a glorious
[1:21:27] victory
[1:21:28] amen we're not called to mediocrity
[1:21:32] now let's turn in galatians 5 and
[1:21:34] i need to just mosey right along here
[1:21:37] galatians 5 1 stand fast therefore what
[1:21:40] are we doing god's revealed to us can
[1:21:43] someone say god's revealed to me
[1:21:46] amen
[1:21:48] stand fast therefore in the liberty
[1:21:50] wherewith christ hath made us free so
[1:21:52] this liberty has already set us free be
[1:21:56] not entangled again right this is like
[1:21:58] going back again to the same thing
[1:22:02] reminds me when
[1:22:04] my dad i i would have been just
[1:22:06] absolutely a baby baby
[1:22:08] but one of dad's neighbors ended up
[1:22:11] going to the hospital and didn't work
[1:22:13] for a day or two and
[1:22:15] then my dad saw him out in the field and
[1:22:17] this is in the day of the side sickle
[1:22:19] mower
[1:22:21] and my dad stopped got out went over to
[1:22:23] him and said hey what was this i heard
[1:22:25] you went to the hospital and had some
[1:22:28] surgery he says well
[1:22:30] he said you know the mower was still
[1:22:31] running and i knew better than to leave
[1:22:33] it running but i looked down there and i
[1:22:35] saw something stuck in the mower so i
[1:22:37] reached down there to do it and i cut
[1:22:38] off a finger
[1:22:42] and the man demonstrating have any of
[1:22:43] you ever done this
[1:22:45] demonstrating and so it was there like
[1:22:48] this and i reached down and he cut
[1:22:50] another finger off
[1:22:56] true story
[1:22:59] back to the hospital he goes
[1:23:02] then
[1:23:03] when i grew up
[1:23:05] i knew orly
[1:23:07] because orley had two stubs and two
[1:23:09] little fingers
[1:23:11] i didn't know the story till later
[1:23:14] but my brother and sister
[1:23:16] don't
[1:23:18] god help us
[1:23:20] not to go back
[1:23:23] you know if he'd just stood there in the
[1:23:25] beginning and said okay it's worth my
[1:23:27] effort to shut the tractor off
[1:23:30] he could have pulled as many things out
[1:23:32] of there as he wanted and walked away
[1:23:33] good
[1:23:34] so it's once the devil tricks you
[1:23:37] but god says don't worry about it i've
[1:23:39] got blood i covered you it's finished
[1:23:41] it's settled don't worry about it don't
[1:23:43] even let condemnation come your way but
[1:23:46] we go back
[1:23:49] come on
[1:23:50] it's what brother david was you know
[1:23:52] kind of interpreting i don't know that
[1:23:54] it's what he said but it's what i heard
[1:23:57] look
[1:23:58] it's the devil flee
[1:24:01] or maybe he's a nice devil
[1:24:06] no such thing
[1:24:07] there's no such thing as a nice devil
[1:24:10] yeah
[1:24:11] so be not entangled again with the yoke
[1:24:14] of bondage so we was there once right
[1:24:16] we've been redeemed from that let's not
[1:24:19] go back
[1:24:20] and so paul says here i say unto you
[1:24:22] that if you be circumstance circumcised
[1:24:25] i mean christ shall profit you nothing
[1:24:27] right so if we are counting oh i hope
[1:24:30] you catch this i'm kind of twisting
[1:24:31] things around but if we declare i
[1:24:34] believe the message i belong to the
[1:24:35] message i attend a message church christ
[1:24:38] shall profit you
[1:24:41] nothing
[1:24:44] we got to come into that place
[1:24:47] circumcised in the spirit realm
[1:24:51] dying out to christ letting him cut away
[1:24:53] everything that's a hindrance to our
[1:24:55] life and not pulling back from that and
[1:24:57] just say lord whatever it is cut on me
[1:25:01] he says you know i testify every man the
[1:25:03] circumcised that he's a debtor to the
[1:25:05] whole law
[1:25:06] and i'm telling you the old testament
[1:25:08] they couldn't keep the law
[1:25:11] not even the priests
[1:25:13] none of them could keep the law
[1:25:16] oh my
[1:25:18] christ has become
[1:25:20] of no effect unto you
[1:25:22] have you ever been in a situation saints
[1:25:24] where the devil
[1:25:25] just kind of
[1:25:26] tries to get you to come to a place that
[1:25:29] i read my bible i read something or
[1:25:32] listen to something out of the message i
[1:25:33] go to church
[1:25:35] i'm okay
[1:25:37] has that ever afflicted you time in my
[1:25:40] life i'll just admit there was time in
[1:25:42] my life i thought i was just doing
[1:25:43] pretty good i went to church i read my
[1:25:45] bible i read something out of the
[1:25:47] message god's gonna do that then i got
[1:25:49] saved
[1:25:55] who's justified by the law you're fallen
[1:25:57] from grace but through the spirit wait
[1:25:59] for the hope of righteousness by faith
[1:26:02] there's where our righteousness will
[1:26:03] rise up theirs were living that life of
[1:26:06] satisfaction how would i say this i
[1:26:09] don't want to say this incorrect
[1:26:12] i'm just going to say it this way and
[1:26:13] trust that you'll understand living that
[1:26:15] life of satisfaction
[1:26:18] living that life not satisfaction in
[1:26:20] ourself but satisfied of what christ has
[1:26:23] done for us and what the word is moving
[1:26:26] us we're still being moved you know it's
[1:26:28] something to say you know praise the
[1:26:30] lord you know uh the lord come and we we
[1:26:33] come into the message you know and uh in
[1:26:36] in 1970
[1:26:40] praise the lord 1970. was god done
[1:26:42] anything since 1970
[1:26:44] we saints should be able to come tonight
[1:26:47] if i could challenge you
[1:26:49] in a very polite and kind way
[1:26:52] we need to have something that we can
[1:26:53] say god came on the scene today
[1:26:57] my god dealt with me
[1:27:00] stirred my soul lifted me up
[1:27:02] brought a standard
[1:27:04] when the devil come like a flood brought
[1:27:06] this standard up
[1:27:08] today
[1:27:10] not even six months ago not a year ago
[1:27:13] definitely not 20 or something years
[1:27:16] that's what should be happening in our
[1:27:18] life
[1:27:19] so it's there
[1:27:20] see
[1:27:21] circumcision avail anything nor
[1:27:24] uncircumcision but faith
[1:27:26] now you did run well
[1:27:29] who did hinder you
[1:27:32] we met that guy on sunday
[1:27:37] lifelong message believer
[1:27:41] knows brother knows brother been to just
[1:27:44] special meetings here camp meeting there
[1:27:47] was over here when the holy ghost fell
[1:27:49] we was here when there was a healing
[1:27:50] took place we was here we've heard the
[1:27:52] testimonies we know these people
[1:27:53] personally
[1:27:56] come on
[1:27:57] won't do us a bit of good
[1:27:59] not one bit
[1:28:01] of good
[1:28:03] we can have set in a chair that the
[1:28:04] prophet sat in we can sleep in a bed the
[1:28:07] prophet slept in
[1:28:09] won't do us one bit of good
[1:28:13] see we run well but something hindered
[1:28:16] us that we didn't obey the truth
[1:28:19] and that's where it comes down
[1:28:21] now verse 8
[1:28:23] very strong verse in my opinion
[1:28:26] this persuasion which is anything short
[1:28:28] of having a new birth and being filled
[1:28:29] with the holy ghost this persuasion come
[1:28:31] not of him that calleth you
[1:28:33] see there's a lot of people persuaded my
[1:28:35] brother and sister that's what's
[1:28:37] happening the influence is moving
[1:28:39] through the land there is things that
[1:28:41] are taking place and people are being
[1:28:44] persuaded as it were and don't realize
[1:28:48] nobody's going to walk up and say here
[1:28:50] you know what let me just clamp this
[1:28:52] yoke of bondage on your neck
[1:28:55] or worse yet on your soul
[1:28:58] nobody's going to do that my brother and
[1:29:00] sister it's by a persuasion as it were
[1:29:04] of look we have quotes that support us
[1:29:06] but what about the word
[1:29:10] you won't find my brother and sister the
[1:29:12] word of god contradicting itself
[1:29:16] but you will
[1:29:18] with a slight spin any of you ever play
[1:29:20] baseball
[1:29:22] yeah kind of good at baseball
[1:29:26] no yes no i'm kind of right there too
[1:29:29] when i was younger
[1:29:32] early high school days i had a pretty
[1:29:33] good slider
[1:29:36] just a certain way to throw that thing
[1:29:39] twist your arm in a totally unnatural
[1:29:42] way catch this
[1:29:44] a totally unnatural way
[1:29:50] my elbow just popped even just doing
[1:29:51] that i don't even have holds of a
[1:29:52] baseball
[1:29:55] but what happened
[1:29:56] in that totally unnatural presentation
[1:30:00] of the message of the hour
[1:30:02] they send that right in there in such a
[1:30:04] fashion that people say that's it
[1:30:09] can't support it with their bible
[1:30:11] they can't get it to all go together
[1:30:15] what is it
[1:30:16] the agenda
[1:30:18] is to bind a yoke of bondage
[1:30:21] upon you
[1:30:25] is it necessary
[1:30:27] many people in the earth today
[1:30:30] it's necessary they have no church
[1:30:33] whatever reasons that they are where
[1:30:35] they are
[1:30:37] one thing but what was the prophet's
[1:30:39] indictment
[1:30:40] they'll come
[1:30:42] a day
[1:30:44] that they won't even cross the
[1:30:46] street to go to the house of god
[1:30:51] we're in that day saints
[1:30:53] what is it satan has actually put a yoke
[1:30:56] upon people
[1:30:59] i'm not saying this judgmentally
[1:31:00] actually makes my heart hurt
[1:31:02] but the yoke is upon them that they
[1:31:05] won't hey i can just sit home and stream
[1:31:07] this
[1:31:08] now that's a necessary ingredient i've
[1:31:09] done it before when i was tired and and
[1:31:12] whatnot you know and you you don't feel
[1:31:14] good but you don't feel right just not
[1:31:16] doing something so by god's grace we can
[1:31:18] stream with the technology but when
[1:31:20] people just take that as their matter of
[1:31:22] course
[1:31:23] and they say no it's good i'm doing just
[1:31:26] as good as i would in the house of god
[1:31:28] well good you know that brother that
[1:31:29] sister that kid you don't like
[1:31:33] might be your own kid
[1:31:35] might be your own husband brother
[1:31:38] or your own
[1:31:39] sister wife
[1:31:40] you don't like
[1:31:43] you know what god does he has a way of
[1:31:44] just rubbing and rubbing and rubbing
[1:31:46] because you see what we think we are
[1:31:49] if it doesn't match what god said we are
[1:31:52] then we have to change
[1:31:55] or should we commission saints i want to
[1:31:57] hurry along here it's nine o'clock
[1:32:00] or should we commission
[1:32:03] a group to
[1:32:05] maybe rewrite the message to make it
[1:32:07] more palatable for our generation
[1:32:12] i'm sure we could find volunteers
[1:32:17] but that's not what we're called to
[1:32:20] the original seed
[1:32:22] that's what god has for us
[1:32:24] hallelujah so look
[1:32:27] my brother and sister let me just say
[1:32:28] this
[1:32:30] we're not here to trade yokes
[1:32:33] we're not going to trade doubts
[1:32:35] for fears because the fear seems to be
[1:32:37] less than the doubts we're not here to
[1:32:39] trade that amen we're not here to trade
[1:32:42] an evil spirit for a religious spirit
[1:32:46] amen we're called out people can someone
[1:32:48] say amen to that called to be the bride
[1:32:50] of christ not called to just be mediocre
[1:32:53] not called to just kind of get along but
[1:32:56] we're desiring and this will be like a
[1:32:58] future deal we're desiring to be yoked
[1:33:00] to christ
[1:33:02] there's where the only yoke that we
[1:33:03] really want is to be yoked to christ
[1:33:05] it's it's not to be yoked into something
[1:33:08] of this world look how this works my
[1:33:10] brother and sister you can take a job i
[1:33:12] won't share the testimony you've heard
[1:33:13] it before but you see satan's so clever
[1:33:16] he'll say you know what if you take this
[1:33:18] job that keeps you out of church you're
[1:33:20] going to make more money and you're
[1:33:22] going to this and it's going to be there
[1:33:23] and that and the benefits and vacation
[1:33:25] time but you won't be able to go to
[1:33:27] church satan what is he doing he's
[1:33:29] holding the yoke as it is there waiting
[1:33:32] for us to put our own head in and later
[1:33:35] we say well the devil did it no you did
[1:33:37] it
[1:33:38] you did it because you didn't pray jerry
[1:33:40] and i it's a joke and i won't go into it
[1:33:42] but i asked sister jerry today just kind
[1:33:44] of a little facetious question i said
[1:33:46] did you pray about that
[1:33:50] you know what her answer was
[1:33:52] i figured if the lord
[1:33:53] would have my husband say yes then that
[1:33:55] was
[1:33:58] wow hallelujah
[1:34:01] i'm telling you saints
[1:34:02] sometimes the devil's tricky
[1:34:05] he's a real character he gets us in
[1:34:07] there and we just like oh it'll be fine
[1:34:09] it's not evil
[1:34:11] well just because it's not evil don't
[1:34:12] mean it's for you
[1:34:14] yeah
[1:34:15] look we're desiring to be yoked with
[1:34:17] christ to be entered into a love affair
[1:34:20] yeah brother david i like that
[1:34:22] yeah just let me let you guys know i
[1:34:24] don't remember just exactly i'll tell
[1:34:26] you
[1:34:27] um
[1:34:28] i'm in an affair
[1:34:30] yep you sure are
[1:34:33] hallelujah
[1:34:34] and that affair is so powerful it's
[1:34:36] binding it's drawing it's holding and it
[1:34:40] can't be broken
[1:34:42] and that's the love affair of the bride
[1:34:43] of christ with her lord jesus christ she
[1:34:46] is bound to him she is yoked up so tight
[1:34:50] to him she couldn't get away from him if
[1:34:53] she wanted to and the devil says i'm
[1:34:55] going to separate him i'm going to
[1:34:56] separate him but you see it's not us my
[1:34:59] brother and sister we're held by the
[1:35:00] yoke which is the love of christ which
[1:35:03] is expressed to us through the holy
[1:35:05] ghost
[1:35:06] hallelujah so it's there we you know
[1:35:08] we might even be dragging i tell you
[1:35:10] it'd be kind of a visual image for you
[1:35:12] maybe that here we are in laodicea
[1:35:14] you're all humans aren't you
[1:35:16] now how many letters am i holding up
[1:35:20] can you type that in the square so we
[1:35:21] make sure you're not a bot
[1:35:26] we can't last five minutes
[1:35:29] you know what the picture would look
[1:35:30] like
[1:35:32] footsteps
[1:35:34] on the sands of time
[1:35:37] but lord there's only one set of
[1:35:38] footsteps i've seen this drawn out it
[1:35:40] was kind of a somewhat partially
[1:35:42] sacrilegious comic
[1:35:45] and i pardoned that but it's a lord
[1:35:47] there's only
[1:35:48] one set of foot steps
[1:35:51] that's when i carried you son they did
[1:35:53] this comic
[1:35:55] of christ
[1:35:57] dragging us
[1:35:59] and it showed two little trenches in the
[1:36:01] beach
[1:36:02] that was our toes as he just took us
[1:36:05] along
[1:36:06] and now i hope that's not offensive to
[1:36:08] you but my brother and sister the truth
[1:36:10] is
[1:36:11] he's carried us
[1:36:13] drug us done whatever he's done he's
[1:36:15] brought us to the place we are right now
[1:36:17] nothing else has
[1:36:19] nothing else has but he has
[1:36:21] hallelujah see we're not serving a god
[1:36:24] of the heavens only but we're serving a
[1:36:25] god who meets us where we're walking
[1:36:28] amen now i just want to jump
[1:36:31] no
[1:36:34] we'll just drag this along on another
[1:36:35] day because i have a whole thing
[1:36:38] that might be a little difficult for
[1:36:40] some of you to
[1:36:42] bite on until you hear the whole thing
[1:36:43] so
[1:36:44] we'll just wait
[1:36:46] but i'll tell you i'll give you just a
[1:36:47] hint of this
[1:36:49] our
[1:36:50] perception
[1:36:52] controls our reality
[1:36:58] sister emmy will you come
[1:37:01] what is our perception
[1:37:06] brother david laid a nice ground
[1:37:10] a little foundation
[1:37:13] you see you've got to be able to go back
[1:37:15] and pinpoint saints
[1:37:17] right to that
[1:37:18] place
[1:37:20] that revelation that paul took to the
[1:37:22] galatians is the same revelation that's
[1:37:24] come to this day and you say how can you
[1:37:26] say that because the prophet of god said
[1:37:28] if paul preached it i preached it it'll
[1:37:30] be the same
[1:37:32] amen what was it he come back to them
[1:37:35] with revelation
[1:37:37] he had now i just want to leave this i'm
[1:37:39] not trying to make a divisive thing here
[1:37:41] just for you to think about it paul had
[1:37:43] come
[1:37:44] by his own words and preached the gospel
[1:37:48] to them at one time
[1:37:50] but now he's come back was it 14 years
[1:37:52] later
[1:37:54] revelation
[1:37:57] how many of us
[1:37:59] i was just a little kid about nine years
[1:38:01] old when my parents come in the message
[1:38:06] you can say i was raised in the message
[1:38:09] when did revelation come
[1:38:13] it's not how long we were there saints
[1:38:16] let it be measured when revelation came
[1:38:18] to us
[1:38:19] when we could pinpoint who we are
[1:38:24] or were if you'd like to use that in
[1:38:25] that phrase
[1:38:27] in jesus christ
[1:38:28] that's what matters that's where the
[1:38:30] revelation has come it's when our
[1:38:32] perception of who we are in the word and
[1:38:36] we realize they're talking about me
[1:38:38] what the prophets say he didn't say
[1:38:40] these things just for words saints he
[1:38:41] said you should be able to find yourself
[1:38:44] in the bible why because when you found
[1:38:47] yourself in there your perception of who
[1:38:51] you are and why you are here changed
[1:38:55] absolutely changed because there's the
[1:38:58] point in time that god starts to open up
[1:39:02] our understanding starts to build that
[1:39:05] up in such a fashion
[1:39:06] i want to read this one very very short
[1:39:09] quote to you and then we'll be done
[1:39:13] this is taken out of satan's eden and i
[1:39:15] pruned it down because i i knew i would
[1:39:18] be too long
[1:39:20] that's what satan does
[1:39:22] he doesn't make us rich
[1:39:26] come on he doesn't make us good-looking
[1:39:28] he doesn't make us smart
[1:39:30] he doesn't make us
[1:39:32] liked
[1:39:33] or likeable
[1:39:37] i could go on with just this whole
[1:39:39] litany i could write a list to cover
[1:39:41] this whole wall of what satan doesn't do
[1:39:44] but i can in one quote show you what he
[1:39:46] does do
[1:39:48] that's what satan does
[1:39:50] he perverts the nations
[1:39:53] boy isn't that terrible how corrupt
[1:39:55] these gov governments are
[1:39:59] just so horrible
[1:40:01] give you a little clue canada
[1:40:03] is working right now to pass a law force
[1:40:06] every farmer to cut fertilizer to grow
[1:40:08] less
[1:40:10] in a time when there's not enough food
[1:40:12] to feed the world
[1:40:15] what are they shooting for
[1:40:17] what is their agenda
[1:40:20] [Music]
[1:40:22] but if they're doing that in the natural
[1:40:24] the prophet of god said the natural and
[1:40:25] the spiritual always travel together
[1:40:27] they're doing their very best
[1:40:31] we can join a reformed church
[1:40:35] which was a church like this
[1:40:38] but we reformed it to look like a
[1:40:39] christian church
[1:40:44] he perverts the nation he perverts the
[1:40:47] church
[1:40:48] he perverts the people
[1:40:50] he
[1:40:51] is a deceiver
[1:40:53] a perverter
[1:40:55] of the original truth
[1:40:59] what is that
[1:41:02] come a little closer
[1:41:04] can i have just one more slight
[1:41:06] statement to you
[1:41:08] we read this scripture where those that
[1:41:10] had been servants
[1:41:12] and it come to their jubilee
[1:41:14] their deliverance
[1:41:17] what would cause
[1:41:20] a man
[1:41:22] who's now been set free
[1:41:24] right
[1:41:25] there's nothing to hold him
[1:41:28] he's free
[1:41:29] and he who is free is free indeed
[1:41:32] what would cause them
[1:41:35] to go to the post
[1:41:38] and allow
[1:41:41] someone to take an awl
[1:41:44] you know i don't even know how that's
[1:41:45] possible
[1:41:46] just pardon me for a second here i got
[1:41:48] to do a little experimentation
[1:41:50] you you know how personal that is
[1:41:53] the guy's got an all right here and a
[1:41:54] hammer right here
[1:41:56] this isn't some
[1:41:58] removed thing that just happened and i
[1:41:59] don't remember when it happened
[1:42:02] are you following me
[1:42:04] when people come to this place that they
[1:42:06] return back to that yoke of bondage it
[1:42:09] is not a position they say i don't know
[1:42:12] when that happened i don't know how that
[1:42:14] happened it was a conscious
[1:42:17] decision
[1:42:20] oh
[1:42:21] the prophet was a good man
[1:42:24] but he got off
[1:42:27] here just a second you've got to see
[1:42:29] where it's all chewed up here all these
[1:42:31] you've got to get your ear
[1:42:34] right there
[1:42:36] it looks like this man striking you in
[1:42:37] the face with a hammer
[1:42:39] you didn't forget it you didn't look
[1:42:42] over it and say i can't remember when
[1:42:44] that happened
[1:42:46] making conscious
[1:42:48] decisions
[1:42:50] to embrace
[1:42:51] satan's eden
[1:42:54] oh my
[1:42:55] i tell you what
[1:42:57] i'm so glad by the power of the word
[1:42:59] we didn't have to fight to break the
[1:43:01] yoke off they fell off
[1:43:04] the holy ghost come and delivered us
[1:43:07] from these yokes in our life that we
[1:43:09] could be free and we could make the
[1:43:11] claim that i am free indeed amen can we
[1:43:15] make that claim tonight i am free indeed
[1:43:19] hallelujah
[1:43:20] hallelujah

[1:43:31] i'm reading satan's eden there brother
[1:43:33] branham is making reference in there and
[1:43:35] right above the song right the quote
[1:43:37] right there that i just put up there for
[1:43:39] you he's there he says let's go stop
[1:43:42] right here and let's just do a little
[1:43:43] explaining and it sounds more like a
[1:43:45] prayer
[1:43:48] but he's coming in that context
[1:43:50] satan the deceiver
[1:43:52] but lord i'm here to surrender all

[1:50:30] i don't know who all's traveling where i
[1:50:33] think about it for the moment but just
[1:50:35] just lift one another up in prayer
[1:50:38] you know we never want to sound boastful
[1:50:40] but you know
[1:50:42] just seems like you go through cycles
[1:50:44] and
[1:50:45] you know you go to bed and you wake up
[1:50:47] tired and somehow you wake up at 3am and
[1:50:50] you can't go back to sleep i don't know
[1:50:52] if you've ever experienced that
[1:50:54] but i'm telling you it's a lovely time
[1:50:56] don't lay there and
[1:50:59] check you know do your checkbook
[1:51:01] bank balance
[1:51:03] don't
[1:51:04] figure out what you got to do and
[1:51:06] rewrite your grocery slip in your head
[1:51:08] again and again and again
[1:51:11] take that time
[1:51:13] i don't know how you would do it and i'm
[1:51:15] not trying to be presumptuous
[1:51:17] myself i'm kind of a visual literal
[1:51:20] i just have to go to one end of the
[1:51:22] valley
[1:51:23] start thinking about who lives
[1:51:26] here
[1:51:27] and who lives there
[1:51:29] and then if we were traveling through
[1:51:30] the valley we would be over here
[1:51:33] and we work our way until we end up over
[1:51:35] there
[1:51:37] you know please don't forget to extend
[1:51:41] your limitation on the other end the
[1:51:43] valley sister april
[1:51:45] uh moving trucks should show up in the
[1:51:47] couple days she said she would
[1:51:49] let us know the laborers with the moving
[1:51:52] company will be doing the labor so
[1:51:55] but just remember extend the
[1:51:57] length of the valley just a little
[1:51:58] further out
[1:52:00] include her and just remember
[1:52:04] you know one time someone told me said
[1:52:06] brother paul
[1:52:07] [Music]
[1:52:10] it's not right for you to preach
[1:52:12] on something or preach about something
[1:52:14] you know about
[1:52:19] [Music]
[1:52:21] i thought okay i understand i actually
[1:52:23] understand where they're coming from
[1:52:26] i know you're misbehaving
[1:52:29] so i'm i'm not supposed to preach on
[1:52:31] that
[1:52:33] except for you see a higher authority
[1:52:36] said
[1:52:39] preach
[1:52:40] that by the hearing of
[1:52:42] the word
[1:52:45] we might be redeemed
[1:52:48] by his precious blood
[1:52:54] [Music]
[1:52:55] forgive me
[1:52:57] don't forget to pray for those things
[1:52:59] that you know
[1:53:05] yeah
[1:53:06] sometimes we're like well lord you know
[1:53:08] what they have need of no voice it
[1:53:11] lord they have this going on in their
[1:53:12] life
[1:53:13] and they stopped and they're listening
[1:53:15] to the devil they didn't run off they're
[1:53:16] listening to him and he's explaining to
[1:53:18] them why
[1:53:20] this yoke was made
[1:53:22] especially
[1:53:25] for them
[1:53:26] i don't need a personalized yoke unless
[1:53:28] the other one is jesus christ
[1:53:30] god bless you i love you amen i'll go
[1:53:32] ahead and preach the rest of my sermon
