[39:34] thank you musicians amen if you have
[39:36] your Bibles tonight we're going to turn
[39:39] over to
[39:40] I believe we're starting in Revelation
[39:46] Revelation chapter 3.
[39:50] it's good to be in the house of God
[39:52] tonight
[39:54] good to be
[39:57] just good to be here
[39:59] Revelations chapter 3
[40:02] and we're going to read verse 20
[40:04] all the way down to chapter 4 verse 1.
[40:11] very familiar portion of scripture
[40:15] but I pray that um
[40:17] we don't glass our eyes don't glass over
[40:19] when we read it but God would bring it
[40:21] fresh that's what I was praying in the
[40:22] office Lord we're going to read quotes
[40:24] we're going to read scriptures that are
[40:25] familiar but may they be fresh like we
[40:28] never heard it before tonight
[40:30] behold I stand at the door and knock if
[40:33] any men hear my voice and open the door
[40:35] I will come into him and will sup with
[40:37] him and he with me now
[40:40] this is Christ meaning has been kicked
[40:43] outside of the church's laodicean Church
[40:45] age
[40:46] and when he says
[40:48] he's knocking on our hearts and he'll
[40:51] sup with us he's going to break bread
[40:52] with us just like he did with those on
[40:54] the road to Emmaus and in doing so just
[40:56] having supper with us he's going to open
[40:58] our eyes to who he is
[41:01] to him that overcometh will like grant
[41:03] us sit with me in my Throne he's coming
[41:05] for the bride who is the overcomer
[41:07] even as I also overcame and him sat down
[41:10] with my father in his throne he that
[41:13] hath an ear let him hear what the spirit
[41:14] saith unto the churches he who was
[41:17] ordained or predestinated
[41:19] after this I looked and behold a door
[41:22] was opened in heaven and the first voice
[41:24] which I heard was as it were of a
[41:26] trumpet talking with me which said come
[41:28] up hither and I will show these the
[41:31] things which must be here after
[41:34] amen so after the closing of the church
[41:37] after the church ages then John is sees
[41:41] the door open which is Christ open
[41:43] because Christ is the door opens to us
[41:46] and God Christ is calling us to come up
[41:48] higher because John's the type of the
[41:50] bride and that is been my focus lately
[41:53] in my study lately God bring me to a
[41:56] higher place
[41:58] not a not nothing not that it would be
[42:00] new or something outside of the book
[42:03] but we're still here so you know what
[42:06] that means we're not high enough so God
[42:09] bring us higher Revelation chapter 10
[42:12] verse 7.
[42:16] now remember John is a type of the Bride
[42:20] says now Revelations 10 verses 7.
[42:24] but in the days of the voice of the
[42:26] seventh angel when he shall begin to
[42:27] sound the mystery of God should be
[42:30] finished in other words it's not a
[42:32] mystery anymore
[42:33] as yet declared to his servants the
[42:36] prophets
[42:37] and the voice which I heard from Heaven
[42:38] spake unto me again and said go and take
[42:42] a little book
[42:44] we have been called to go and take the
[42:48] book
[42:50] which is open in the hand of the Angel
[42:52] which standeth upon the sea and upon the
[42:54] Earth and I went under the angel and
[42:56] said unto him give me the little book
[42:58] two actions he had to go and he had to
[43:01] ask
[43:04] um
[43:05] and I took the little book Excuse me
[43:07] give me the little book and he sent it
[43:08] to me take it and eat it up and it shall
[43:11] make thy belly bitter but it shall be in
[43:13] thy mouth sweet as honey it wasn't until
[43:16] John made the actions State the steps in
[43:19] the direction that then he was told what
[43:21] to do with the book
[43:22] God tries our faith go take the book and
[43:26] you ask for it then God gives it to you
[43:28] now he says you eat this up eat this up
[43:30] and I took the little book out of the
[43:32] Angel's hand and ate it up and it was in
[43:33] my mouth sweet as honey
[43:35] and as soon as I had eaten it my belly
[43:37] was bitter like last Wednesday talked
[43:40] about facing our humanity and you eat
[43:41] the book suddenly you see you are full
[43:44] of unrighteousness
[43:45] you have to face that you have to face
[43:47] the word of God to change you
[43:50] and it is a it is it is all some also
[43:52] sometimes a hard thing to live hard
[43:55] thing to you know separate from mother
[43:56] and father and all that and he said unto
[43:58] me verse 11 thou must prophesy again
[44:02] before many peoples and Nations and
[44:04] tongues and Kings may the Lord bless the
[44:07] reading of his word you can be seated
[44:11] so my title tonight
[44:14] is the finished cycle
[44:17] and my subtitle
[44:19] can you pull that screen up there Gideon
[44:23] the title screen
[44:24] so by title is the finished cycle and my
[44:26] subtitle is this is it
[44:29] so
[44:31] um
[44:32] brother we're going to read a quote here
[44:34] brother management is the it's it's
[44:35] actually from the church age book resume
[44:37] of the ages brother mentions apostasy
[44:40] and so I wanted to Define apostasy
[44:42] apostasy means the emba the abandonment
[44:45] or renunciation of a religious or
[44:48] political belief the abandonment or
[44:52] renunciation
[44:53] he says in the resume of the ages he
[44:55] says but the age
[44:57] in which each lived was not the age of
[45:00] restoration
[45:01] neither was there any age but this last
[45:04] age the age of complete blackout in
[45:07] apostasy
[45:08] so
[45:10] what are we living in today I mean
[45:12] complete abandonment
[45:14] and renunciation of religion of of of of
[45:16] of Christianity you know down to the
[45:19] ages
[45:20] everybody went to church on Sunday
[45:21] everything closed on Sunday not today
[45:24] whatever it wants to do as much as they
[45:27] can to not be identified with
[45:29] Christianity
[45:31] and you know in dealing in in
[45:34] preparing for this sermon tonight I just
[45:37] I had this this this
[45:39] uh
[45:41] this
[45:43] pricking in the back of my my my heart
[45:45] my mind my heart
[45:47] of inspiration but I didn't know I
[45:50] didn't know what it was yet
[45:52] and uh so I don't know exactly how this
[45:55] is gonna go tonight I don't know which
[45:57] direction this is
[45:58] but my desire is
[46:02] I'm feeling impressed upon
[46:04] to
[46:06] to look at the scripture so look at the
[46:07] quotes
[46:09] to challenge us with the question what
[46:11] are we what are we doing
[46:13] right now because this is it
[46:17] there's no you know in Matthew 11 verse
[46:21] 3
[46:22] the Disciples of John go to Jesus and
[46:24] say Jesus John has sent us to ask are
[46:26] you the one or do we look for another
[46:28] we're not looking for another
[46:30] this is it you know if you will God has
[46:33] has he had his Workshop
[46:36] beginning of time he began to begin to
[46:38] speak the word to create the world the
[46:40] light there be light all these things
[46:42] come down and and then and then he said
[46:44] in planned Redemption when Adam and Eve
[46:46] fell and he worked on this Plan of
[46:48] Redemption and he brought it down
[46:49] Through the Ages and and you had you
[46:52] know polycarp and Paul and all down
[46:54] Through the Ages and then and then he
[46:55] brought the seventh angel or the
[46:57] messenger for the Branham spoke through
[46:59] him brought the word open the word to us
[47:02] and then now the last thing is is for us
[47:05] to go
[47:06] so if you allow me the Liberty to say
[47:09] this God's sweeping up his Workshop
[47:11] because the whole thing is done
[47:15] that's it this is it
[47:18] we don't have to look for another this
[47:20] is it the brother Adam says in this
[47:21] quote this is the finishing cycle he
[47:24] says the age of the finishing cycle this
[47:26] is where I got my title so let's keep
[47:28] reading this is the age of apostasy and
[47:31] this is the age of restoration it is the
[47:33] age of the finished cycle
[47:36] in other words eternity goes into psych
[47:39] eternity is a is like a circle goes in a
[47:42] cycle but guess what God's fixing to to
[47:45] end it and he's done it
[47:50] he's done it
[47:51] now now this is for me and you it's not
[47:54] done for the Jews but I'm not a Jew are
[47:56] you
[47:58] I'll let God deal with him
[48:01] I want to be tucked away in the palace
[48:06] so this is it so what are we doing
[48:10] we you are standing Before the Throne
[48:12] and the little book is out there waiting
[48:15] for you to take it what are you doing
[48:17] are you looking for another Revival are
[48:19] you looking for another great ministry
[48:22] no this is it
[48:25] this is the finished cycle
[48:28] this is that point in time where we're
[48:30] down through history they were waiting
[48:32] for this yeah
[48:33] yeah they were looking for this you know
[48:36] how like I remember as a kid I built a
[48:37] tree house
[48:39] and when it was done I was like well
[48:40] that's it
[48:41] the fun part was building it right so so
[48:44] we're building it Revival Azusa right
[48:47] the ministry of the brother random all
[48:49] these things happen the sword on the
[48:51] mountain great things happening we're
[48:52] after the other all you had to do is
[48:53] stand there and be like wow you were
[48:55] sucked up into it but now
[48:56] now the word is there laying for you
[49:01] this is it go take the book
[49:04] go get it
[49:06] if it's that simple why are we sitting
[49:10] around not taking the book notice I said
[49:14] we
[49:15] why are we
[49:17] it's right there
[49:19] amen and this is it
[49:21] I'm going to say that a lot tonight so
[49:22] just could deal with it
[49:24] with this it is all over now this is the
[49:27] resume of age this is the end of the
[49:28] church age book he said so we conclude
[49:31] the seven Church ages saying only what
[49:33] the spirit said to each age he that hath
[49:35] an ear let him hear what the spirit
[49:37] saith unto the churches I sincerely
[49:40] believe that the spirit of God has been
[49:42] speaking to us not only teaching us the
[49:44] truth of the ages now I I put I put the
[49:47] closing in here because for me it really
[49:49] it really it really
[49:51] um kind of brought it home
[49:53] when as he wraps of the church the
[49:55] church age book what he says really
[49:57] brought it home that that this is this
[49:59] is it this is the finished cycle I
[50:01] sincerely believe okay
[50:02] that is the reason for all preaching and
[50:04] teaching for it is in the preaching and
[50:06] teaching of the word that the sheep hear
[50:08] the voice of God and follow him
[50:11] not for one moment do I bring do I need
[50:14] to say
[50:16] preaching and teaching of the word do I
[50:18] need to say
[50:21] the other thing is not there
[50:25] we need pastors and preachers and
[50:27] evangelists and apostles not for one
[50:29] woman do I bring a message to the people
[50:31] that they may follow me or join my
[50:33] church or start some fellowship and
[50:35] organization I have never done that and
[50:37] will not do that now I have no interest
[50:39] in those things but I do have an
[50:41] interest in the things of God and people
[50:42] and if I can accomplish this one thing I
[50:45] will be satisfied I believe as a
[50:46] minister and any other ministers our
[50:48] pastor and Brother David this is our
[50:50] desires as ministers that'll be
[50:52] satisfied that one thing is to see
[50:54] established a true spiritual
[50:55] relationship between God and men and man
[50:59] I might print that and put that on my
[51:00] wall that is my burden saints that is my
[51:03] burden and every time I prepare to to
[51:06] minister and and I don't say this to
[51:08] lift myself up
[51:09] but you just you have to come to the
[51:11] reality that I cannot convince you
[51:13] that's right amen I wish I could
[51:19] but I don't wish I could because if I
[51:21] could we know the rest of the story
[51:23] wherein men become New Creations in
[51:27] Christ you know what I love to see I
[51:29] love to see
[51:31] somebody get consecrated
[51:34] and coming
[51:35] Faithfully to church feeding the word
[51:37] faithfully and little by little you see
[51:39] their lives change now we should look in
[51:42] our own back in our own lives and say
[51:44] well I hardly recognize that man four
[51:45] years ago
[51:47] we should do that so look
[51:49] retrospectively
[51:50] that is a you as a youth leader as a
[51:52] minister I'd love to see God and you
[51:55] know what it it it sometimes God will
[51:57] bring us someone a soul in and and boom
[52:00] they're serving God and that might
[52:02] happen What would appear quickly but
[52:05] what I love to say is years go by you
[52:07] come back years later you go wow
[52:11] you were pressing on for God you were
[52:13] growing in the word and I hope that they
[52:15] would see the same in me live according
[52:18] to his word I would invite plea and warn
[52:21] all to hear his voice at this time and
[52:23] yield your lives completely to him even
[52:25] as I trust in my heart that I have given
[52:27] my all to him God bless you and may his
[52:29] coming Rejoice your heart
[52:31] so I already read Matthew 11 3 and said
[52:34] unto him art thou he that should come or
[52:36] do me look for another we're not looking
[52:38] for another I didn't give it to you by
[52:40] the Gideon we're not looking for another
[52:41] we're not this is it
[52:44] this is the finished cycle and thank God
[52:47] for that this is what the sages of the
[52:50] ages have longed for and we have it
[52:53] right there
[52:55] we have it right there God help us not
[52:56] leave it sitting on the nightstand
[53:00] in Jeremiah 33 verse 11.
[53:03] it says the voice of joy and the voice
[53:05] of gladness the voice of the bridegroom
[53:07] and the voice of the Bride
[53:11] you see we read here I'll flip back to
[53:14] it
[53:15] chapter 4 verse 1.
[53:17] um
[53:18] or excuse me no revelation's 10. he said
[53:21] unto me thou must prophesy again before
[53:23] many peoples and Nations and tongues and
[53:25] Kings the bride has eaten the book
[53:28] and she is called to go and speak the
[53:31] book
[53:34] preach the book to to every every for
[53:37] every people's Nations and tongues and
[53:39] kings
[53:40] it's the voice of the Bride
[53:42] the voice of them that shall say praise
[53:45] the Lord opposed you see adoration to
[53:48] God
[53:49] not man
[53:51] brother man he preaches these sermons
[53:53] and I don't know I look at it this way I
[53:56] look at it this way he get he'll he'll
[53:58] be preaching a sermon say for example
[53:59] like The Siege shall not be able to
[54:01] Shook and and it's you got to slow down
[54:03] and you got to take that piece by piece
[54:06] but every time he always brings it back
[54:09] to the one thing
[54:11] feed on the word
[54:14] and for me and myself I always thought
[54:16] man why don't like I need to stop saying
[54:20] that it's too simple
[54:22] but then you feed the word of God and
[54:23] you you eat the book and you and you
[54:26] study to minister you go well that's the
[54:28] whole thing
[54:30] that's what it's all about
[54:32] and you travel and you hear about people
[54:34] and and young people especially
[54:37] a lot of them don't even read their
[54:39] Bibles
[54:41] and I'm not saying that in a judgmental
[54:43] way
[54:44] but I wonder what happened
[54:48] what happened you can't serve God unless
[54:52] you do
[54:53] and I know I'm probably preaching to the
[54:54] choir I hope I'm preaching to the choir
[54:57] I know the youth have heard this because
[54:59] I
[55:00] I labor it to them
[55:02] you cannot do it you say oh I need to
[55:04] overcome so you go to camp and you go to
[55:06] the altar but nothing changes because
[55:09] that is not gonna change you permanently
[55:11] you need the word now you can have an
[55:15] experience and God can set you
[55:17] into your path of victory
[55:19] but you have to maintain that
[55:22] relationship brother Madam says you have
[55:24] to maintain your faith or you'll lose
[55:26] your healing
[55:27] the same thing applies to your spiritual
[55:29] life
[55:30] that's why you know if if if if if you
[55:34] are not careful
[55:36] never mind so praise the Lord of hosts
[55:39] for the Lord is good for his mercy
[55:41] endureth forever me and brother Alex
[55:43] we're talking about that in the office
[55:44] thank you God for your grace
[55:47] thank you for your grace when I see
[55:50] people and I see them just you know
[55:53] for any lost soul I I I have a heart but
[55:58] when you see people go and they just go
[56:00] wham left field hardcore
[56:04] I just I feel
[56:05] so bad for them
[56:08] I don't say you know I I just I
[56:11] because they don't know the truth
[56:14] they're trying to fix a problem
[56:17] with the world's answers
[56:20] and I can't the hard part is I can't go
[56:22] to them and say look now listen up
[56:26] it doesn't do any good
[56:30] that's now what I'm talking about is
[56:31] different than going after your brother
[56:33] and talking to him that's different
[56:34] brother Graham says you should do that
[56:37] so he says the scripture in Jeremiah 3
[56:39] to 3 11 I'm going to finish this and of
[56:41] them that shall bring the sacrifice of
[56:43] praise unto the house into the house of
[56:45] the Lord for I will cause to return the
[56:48] Captivity of the land as at the first
[56:50] saith the Lord what happened we're in
[56:52] the promised land okay
[56:54] so the the land was under the bondage of
[56:58] organization
[56:59] but then God came and he opened the land
[57:02] to us and now the fruits that come from
[57:05] the land are ours to take
[57:08] we gotta fight for them but they're ours
[57:11] to take
[57:12] the land is free for us to use it was
[57:15] under the bondage of of the the
[57:17] methodists and the amorites
[57:20] but now it's open to us
[57:25] and the fruits are yours
[57:28] unless you fall into idolatry
[57:31] then the fruits become somebody else's
[57:34] they come when they steal your corn
[57:36] and then you've got to do like shamgar
[57:38] and take it back
[57:41] but God gives you the ability for that
[57:44] lasting difference in your life
[57:46] and that fruit you feed on the fruit you
[57:48] see we struggle sometimes to Bear the
[57:51] fruit and leave the land in captivity
[57:54] stop cultivating the garden and deal
[57:57] with the bad guys
[57:59] you're gonna because all you're doing is
[58:00] gonna grow corn for the Philistines
[58:04] shamgar had to stop dealing with the
[58:06] animals stop dealing with the corn and
[58:07] go fight the enemy get the enemy out of
[58:10] your land first then work on the land
[58:12] because you'll work on the land and
[58:14] they'll take the fruit
[58:16] but you get the devil out of your life
[58:18] get the devil out of here now that
[58:19] sounds really really harsh
[58:22] but the devil can be your pride
[58:28] you know it doesn't have to be some
[58:30] great sin it can just be your Humanity
[58:33] your weaknesses your complexes get that
[58:36] dealt with
[58:38] cultivate the land
[58:40] and got the fruits that you that you
[58:42] receive from that
[58:44] will give you greater strength to keep
[58:46] the enemy off your land
[58:50] now
[58:52] uh so the voice of the bridegroom the
[58:56] voice of the Bride
[58:58] yeah Brother David
[59:01] but the wise answered so excuse me
[59:03] Matthew 25 verse 9. so now we're at the
[59:05] the wise and the foolish version let's
[59:06] get back on topic here I got a bunny
[59:09] trailer
[59:11] now
[59:13] we got the we're talking about the the
[59:15] finished cycle and this is it okay
[59:17] Matthew 25 9 we we step into the middle
[59:21] of the story of the wise and the foolish
[59:23] virgin and says but the wise answered
[59:26] they answered the foolish version saying
[59:28] not so get your own oil lest there less
[59:31] because they're asking for oil not so
[59:33] unless there be not enough for us and
[59:36] you but go ye rather to them that sell
[59:39] and buy for yourselves now
[59:43] we are right there
[59:47] we are with the bridegroom
[59:52] in a marriage
[59:55] now we're not raptured yet
[59:58] but we are right here in that Union with
[1:00:00] God
[1:00:01] see see I always I totally used to use
[1:00:04] this and maybe I'm a little bit too much
[1:00:06] of a nerd but in in geometry
[1:00:09] you have what's called theorems now it's
[1:00:10] been a while since I did geometry I just
[1:00:12] remembered this this part so if I
[1:00:14] explain it wrong just go look it up and
[1:00:16] forgive me
[1:00:17] but if if you have in ethereum if you
[1:00:19] have a truth for example you know it's
[1:00:21] geometry so it's different but four plus
[1:00:23] four equals eight then you know
[1:00:26] the next thing is true
[1:00:29] now in studying the word of God it's
[1:00:32] actually the same way
[1:00:34] if we are Rebecca and Isaac in the tent
[1:00:39] we can't be the virgins outside of the
[1:00:42] house
[1:00:46] right so you take truths God reveals
[1:00:48] something to you he gives you revelation
[1:00:50] of a truth now take that truth as a
[1:00:53] little Looking Glass and run back
[1:00:55] through all of the scriptures back
[1:00:57] through all of the message and because
[1:00:59] of that little truth
[1:01:01] things will pop out that you never saw
[1:01:03] before because you're running that truth
[1:01:04] back to the word that Revelation so now
[1:01:06] if we're with Isaac and we have to
[1:01:08] receive C
[1:01:10] we're married okay so we're not
[1:01:14] virgins anymore
[1:01:16] we're not outside of the house now we're
[1:01:19] not raptured
[1:01:20] the foolish virgin are looking for oil
[1:01:24] they're looking for Oil we're somewhere
[1:01:26] be in this in this verse right here
[1:01:28] we're somewhere we're with the
[1:01:30] bridegroom and we're somewhere in that
[1:01:31] those verses there that's where we are
[1:01:34] today because we have to receive the
[1:01:36] word seed to bring forth the promised
[1:01:38] son
[1:01:39] now just so you know I'm not losing my
[1:01:40] mind
[1:01:41] and making this up the fire attire and
[1:01:44] church age when the cry went out behold
[1:01:45] the bridegroom cometh the five foolish
[1:01:48] had to run seeking oil while the five
[1:01:51] wise virgins went into the marriage
[1:01:54] the five that remained outside were left
[1:01:57] to the Great Tribulation now the Great
[1:01:58] Tribulation has not happened yet
[1:02:00] but they're left outside
[1:02:05] I'm not going to decide who is who
[1:02:08] going to preach the word because the
[1:02:11] foolish are looking for the oil
[1:02:14] the five that remained outside were left
[1:02:16] to the Great Tribulation that is what
[1:02:18] will happen to all who do not go up in
[1:02:20] the rapture
[1:02:22] so
[1:02:25] in in Matthew 22 verse 1.
[1:02:30] Matthew 22 verse 1.
[1:02:35] and Jesus answered and speak unto them
[1:02:37] again by Parables and said the Kingdom
[1:02:40] of Heaven is like unto a certain King
[1:02:41] which made a marriage for his son now I
[1:02:44] appreciate Brother David
[1:02:46] ministering the other day and and just
[1:02:49] inspiration the Lord spoke and I never
[1:02:51] saw this in this way before until that
[1:02:54] point in time just goes to show you God
[1:02:56] God working the way he said he would
[1:02:59] through the Revival Ministry
[1:03:01] the Kingdom of Heaven is like unto a
[1:03:03] certain King which made a marriage for
[1:03:05] his son
[1:03:06] hmm another this marriage and sent forth
[1:03:09] his servants to call them that were
[1:03:11] Biden to the wedding and they would not
[1:03:13] come again he sent forth other servants
[1:03:15] saying tell them which are bidden behold
[1:03:17] I have prepared my dinner my ox and my
[1:03:19] fatlings are killed and all things
[1:03:20] already come unto the marriage but they
[1:03:22] made light of it and went their ways and
[1:03:24] went to his farm another said look
[1:03:26] brother why can't you just teach people
[1:03:28] the gifts
[1:03:31] another two is merchandise and Remnant
[1:03:33] took his servants and entreated them
[1:03:34] spitefully and slew them
[1:03:38] but when the king heard thereof he was
[1:03:40] Wrath so so the king turned he gave them
[1:03:43] a chance
[1:03:45] he gave the denominations a chance
[1:03:48] the message was come out of Babylon into
[1:03:51] the truth he gave them a chance to come
[1:03:54] to the marriage but they returned it
[1:03:55] down
[1:03:57] so
[1:03:58] God turned
[1:04:05] and when the king heard thereof he was
[1:04:07] Wrath and he sent forth his armies and
[1:04:08] destroyed those murders and burned up
[1:04:10] their City
[1:04:11] God left them left the move there
[1:04:15] outside of the church now he says then
[1:04:18] he said to his servants the wedding is
[1:04:20] ready but they which forbidden were not
[1:04:21] worthy thank you Lord
[1:04:24] that he saw me worthy how
[1:04:27] I don't I don't care
[1:04:30] I don't care how or why I just know
[1:04:32] because
[1:04:34] because I'm here today and that makes me
[1:04:36] happy
[1:04:37] and go therefore into the highways and
[1:04:40] as many as you shall find bid to the
[1:04:42] marriage
[1:04:43] who who are these people coming up
[1:04:46] I mean where do they come from you go
[1:04:48] listen to the to different testimonies
[1:04:50] of brothers and coming and and me and
[1:04:52] you coming where I mean where did we
[1:04:54] come from you know
[1:04:57] and um and uh okay going therefore to
[1:05:00] the highways and as many as you shall
[1:05:02] find bid to the marriage so those
[1:05:04] servants went out into the highways and
[1:05:05] gathered together all as many as they
[1:05:07] found both bad and good
[1:05:11] and the wedding was furnished with
[1:05:13] guests
[1:05:14] and when the king came in to see the
[1:05:16] guest he saw their man which had not on
[1:05:19] a wedding garment
[1:05:22] oh did you hear about that Pastor left
[1:05:25] the message
[1:05:30] now I don't know if they're saved or not
[1:05:32] I'm not saying that's a sign of where
[1:05:33] we're living
[1:05:35] you gotta have the wedding Garden what's
[1:05:37] the wedding garment it's the new birth
[1:05:39] you got to be clothed in the word of God
[1:05:42] and God is showing us in the time that
[1:05:45] we live I'm just using scriptures and
[1:05:46] quotes to show you tonight where we are
[1:05:47] right now God is using that to show us
[1:05:50] look it's got to be the word because now
[1:05:52] in the time that we are living in it's
[1:05:55] the marriage
[1:05:58] and the only thing that's going to keep
[1:06:00] you there the only one that's going to
[1:06:01] keep you consecrated to your husband
[1:06:03] Christ
[1:06:04] is being clothed in the word clothed in
[1:06:08] the garments he has purchased for you
[1:06:11] he purchased those garments for you
[1:06:14] now we have to call ourselves that's the
[1:06:16] only thing so today they they they faked
[1:06:19] it they faked it but then the god the
[1:06:21] word came and said it's time to divide
[1:06:24] it's time to divide so don't don't feel
[1:06:26] bad don't don't count them out you don't
[1:06:28] know
[1:06:29] you don't know who's who or what's what
[1:06:31] don't count them out but use that to
[1:06:33] show you this is it
[1:06:35] this is the finished cycle
[1:06:38] don't look for another Revival there'll
[1:06:41] be Revival in our hearts right because
[1:06:43] God's word is opening to us and that
[1:06:46] makes me excited
[1:06:48] that's Revival to me
[1:06:50] but there's no more great sweeping
[1:06:52] movements to sweep people along
[1:06:55] because you see as the wheat grew it
[1:06:57] drug everything with it but then the
[1:06:59] seed came and now you know this is this
[1:07:03] now there's a separation all along it
[1:07:05] was the same thing the life the same
[1:07:08] thing but then it's separated seed from
[1:07:12] the plant
[1:07:14] that is where we are today
[1:07:17] so
[1:07:18] this is it
[1:07:21] why don't we just take the book and get
[1:07:23] on with it
[1:07:25] and we are we are
[1:07:27] but I'm challenging you I'm challenging
[1:07:30] me God bring me up higher what does that
[1:07:33] mean what does bring me up higher mean
[1:07:34] greater knowledge of the word no
[1:07:38] too many people have the knowledge and
[1:07:40] then they turn right around and walk
[1:07:42] away
[1:07:43] because knowledge doesn't do any good
[1:07:45] it's Revelation so it's the word that's
[1:07:48] it written upon the table of your heart
[1:07:54] and that is what's going to make the
[1:07:58] difference
[1:08:01] you know what it fascinates me to look
[1:08:04] at the history of the message since
[1:08:05] brother manner passed away
[1:08:07] the little bit the little that I know of
[1:08:09] it it was like kids with with something
[1:08:11] that didn't know what they were doing
[1:08:12] with
[1:08:14] wow wow what is this right and then you
[1:08:18] started to grow up and say ah
[1:08:20] some people said ah
[1:08:22] never mind
[1:08:25] a few years ago 10 years ago 2012. maybe
[1:08:28] a little bit longer than that
[1:08:30] people said ah never mind it's not cool
[1:08:32] anymore it's not exciting it's not new
[1:08:37] foreign but what was it
[1:08:40] it wasn't sweeping them along anymore
[1:08:44] they weren't caught up in it anymore God
[1:08:46] began to pick the fish from the net
[1:08:48] that's right say no never mind
[1:08:51] wow this is the salmon no never mind
[1:08:55] now we pity them
[1:08:57] but at the same time we should be
[1:08:59] excited say wow this is it this is the
[1:09:01] finished cycle
[1:09:03] and that should get us excited that
[1:09:05] should get us not that you have to jump
[1:09:06] up and shout right now I just mean
[1:09:07] inspired
[1:09:09] I don't when I say excited I don't need
[1:09:11] an outward expression you know
[1:09:13] I mean inspiration you get up and that's
[1:09:16] what gets you out of bed in the morning
[1:09:17] say wow God what what's next do you
[1:09:20] think Enoch do you think Enoch was just
[1:09:22] like yeah
[1:09:23] okay yeah God Bible cool
[1:09:26] no you're kidding me people were like oh
[1:09:29] here comes Enoch again we're gonna hear
[1:09:31] all about it
[1:09:34] you should be that person
[1:09:36] that in the conversation you know
[1:09:39] you just talk about the word and
[1:09:42] not that you're trying to make a point
[1:09:43] or be heard but it just spills over
[1:09:46] that's right just spills over
[1:09:50] that's Revival
[1:09:52] that's the bride's Revival what is the
[1:09:54] bride's Revival it's not Azusa Street
[1:09:58] it's the word when you see the word why
[1:10:02] did Brother random run around the tree
[1:10:05] because he saw himself in the book he
[1:10:08] saw himself in the word
[1:10:10] why do I get excited and run around
[1:10:13] sometimes
[1:10:14] because I see myself in the book
[1:10:18] you say you see you'll see your name
[1:10:20] written over and over again that's right
[1:10:22] it's written once but you
[1:10:24] God will show you something in the word
[1:10:25] say wow there's my name again
[1:10:28] because the book of redemption
[1:10:30] is well okay the book religion is with
[1:10:33] us
[1:10:34] but it's also with us
[1:10:37] it's right here you were written on the
[1:10:39] pages
[1:10:42] so this marriage is happening and he
[1:10:44] finds anyone that's not wearing a
[1:10:46] garment he said saith unto him friend
[1:10:48] how cameth thou and hither not having a
[1:10:51] wedding garment and he was speechless
[1:10:53] then said the kings of the serpents bind
[1:10:55] him hound and hand and foot and take him
[1:10:57] away and cast him into outer Darkness
[1:10:59] there should be weeping and gnashing of
[1:11:01] teeth
[1:11:02] there shall be right so he's cast out
[1:11:05] but the world is the world weeping a
[1:11:07] gnashing of teeth is that to come there
[1:11:10] shall be for many are called
[1:11:13] but few
[1:11:14] are chosen in other words we needed some
[1:11:18] of these men
[1:11:19] to furnish
[1:11:21] the wedding
[1:11:22] we needed some of these men to be guests
[1:11:25] to furnish it some of these women what
[1:11:28] push the look
[1:11:30] now I'm just going to be very factual
[1:11:34] nothing against anyone but look at voice
[1:11:35] of God they pushed the word out there
[1:11:39] now they're they're off in left field
[1:11:41] and we pray for them we don't judge them
[1:11:43] whatever that's their thing but they God
[1:11:46] used that as a vehicle to push the word
[1:11:48] out amen look look at look at what what
[1:11:50] you know Jeff Jenkins and that church
[1:11:52] did with brother Lonnie and everything
[1:11:54] then they God used them to furnish
[1:11:57] a wedding
[1:11:59] the word is getting out there
[1:12:02] then but then there came a time where
[1:12:04] people all over the world started to
[1:12:06] raise up and say now hang on a second
[1:12:10] why is it now we're just now getting
[1:12:13] these books and stuff interpreted into
[1:12:16] languages
[1:12:18] what about all the years we've had and
[1:12:20] and why why did God allow that to just
[1:12:22] do what it did
[1:12:26] I don't know the answer to that question
[1:12:27] but I do know
[1:12:29] now this is it they have to know
[1:12:33] so God said hey God's perfectly on time
[1:12:38] and anyone who's been around the block a
[1:12:41] time or two
[1:12:43] doesn't care who you are or what church
[1:12:45] you come from they want the word of God
[1:12:47] so they're ready now
[1:12:51] these places in these other countries
[1:12:53] they're ready now for the truth they're
[1:12:56] tired of the men
[1:12:57] who fake it and then cause problems
[1:13:01] they're ready for the truth
[1:13:03] and that truth is going to bring that
[1:13:05] separation saints of God this is it
[1:13:08] this is the finished cycle
[1:13:12] I want to be
[1:13:14] walking forward and saying give me the
[1:13:16] book
[1:13:18] and then I want to eat it
[1:13:19] because we got the book you know what
[1:13:21] why do we why do we have iPads and
[1:13:24] iPhones and message books and tapes and
[1:13:27] bibles and bibles and bibles so we have
[1:13:29] no excuse
[1:13:33] I I've seen this in in my own life and
[1:13:36] in the life of others over the past few
[1:13:37] years
[1:13:40] God will always have somebody with a
[1:13:42] testimony
[1:13:43] so somebody else has no excuse
[1:13:46] you say why am I walking through this
[1:13:48] well for one it's gonna build character
[1:13:50] in your life but the other hand you're
[1:13:53] an example
[1:13:55] you walk through
[1:13:57] the divorce
[1:14:00] you're an example you walk through
[1:14:03] your husband walking out and I know this
[1:14:05] isn't here
[1:14:07] you're an example
[1:14:09] parents walk away you still serve the
[1:14:12] god serve god you're an example sister
[1:14:14] walks away you still serve the god
[1:14:16] brother but you're an example
[1:14:20] you face hardship you face false
[1:14:22] Doctrine might as well be called a cult
[1:14:26] you walk out of it you serve God what
[1:14:29] you're an example nobody has
[1:14:36] now that's the negative side of it the
[1:14:38] positive is you is those who have are
[1:14:42] walking that and you can look at them
[1:14:44] and say I made it amen you can too or
[1:14:48] you see them and you pray and say God
[1:14:51] somehow you brought me through you can
[1:14:54] do the same thing for them
[1:14:56] you can do the same thing for them
[1:14:59] so
[1:15:02] Revelations chapter 19.
[1:15:12] verse 6.
[1:15:18] and I heard as it were the voice of a
[1:15:20] great multitude and as the voice of many
[1:15:21] Waters and as the voice of Mighty
[1:15:24] thundering saying Alleluia for the Lord
[1:15:26] God omnipotent reigned look at this
[1:15:28] again
[1:15:30] adoration
[1:15:32] first thing
[1:15:33] God
[1:15:35] first thing Christ
[1:15:37] my kids wanted me to tell the story We
[1:15:39] and do we do devotions uh we we learned
[1:15:44] uh from from
[1:15:45] um actually we were we were listening to
[1:15:47] brother rap crook when I was there in in
[1:15:49] North Carolina ministering with him and
[1:15:53] uh he just you know God just showed us
[1:15:55] hey this is how you do devotions with
[1:15:57] kids so I tell I either tell a story or
[1:16:00] they act it out
[1:16:02] and we acted out and so they were the
[1:16:04] kids wanted wanted the Ten Commandments
[1:16:06] last uh last night
[1:16:08] so
[1:16:10] um you know I told I I we sat down for
[1:16:13] that one I told the story
[1:16:15] and I said I don't know why this is I'm
[1:16:19] losing my train of thought
[1:16:24] oh God first so I said
[1:16:27] they they chose the idol they chose that
[1:16:31] golden calf
[1:16:33] and they brought it higher than God
[1:16:36] and anything in your life that you bring
[1:16:38] higher than God
[1:16:40] becomes an idol
[1:16:42] work
[1:16:44] housework
[1:16:46] gotta clean the kitchen
[1:16:47] did you read your Bible
[1:16:50] but the Chris we have moved Beyond such
[1:16:53] simple things then why are we still
[1:16:55] doing it
[1:16:58] put you in remembrance of these things
[1:17:01] look at Paul he had to go back Galatians
[1:17:04] what are you doing
[1:17:06] you were Faithfully taught you know
[1:17:08] Corinthians whoever it was so
[1:17:11] adoration to God first and foremost

[1:17:16] honor to him for the marriage of the
[1:17:18] Lamb is come and his wife hath made
[1:17:22] herself ready not will
[1:17:29] it's the finished cycle
[1:17:31] like I said God swept up his Workshop
[1:17:35] it's there it's ready
[1:17:38] all he's got to do is roll up the door
[1:17:40] and drive it out
[1:17:41] it's ready
[1:17:44] the bride's there with him
[1:17:46] they're ready to take that Chariot to
[1:17:48] the sky
[1:17:50] he's finished the work
[1:17:52] he's wrapped it up
[1:17:54] now the last thing to do is for us
[1:17:57] to rapture
[1:18:00] this is it amen the age of the finished
[1:18:04] cycle amen there's not another thing
[1:18:06] coming
[1:18:08] so that puts the responsibility what I'm
[1:18:11] trying to say tonight and what what I
[1:18:13] believe the Lord is trying to say is I
[1:18:14] put the responsibility in your hands
[1:18:17] because he's done it it's perfectly
[1:18:19] prepared for you
[1:18:21] get up and take the book
[1:18:24] get up and take the word not take a man
[1:18:28] don't take me please don't take my word
[1:18:31] for it
[1:18:32] you know why
[1:18:35] I want you to go to the word because the
[1:18:37] next time I preach you'll be saying amen
[1:18:40] ahead of me and as a minister
[1:18:43] The Minister's here I love that when
[1:18:45] someone's one step ahead you say praise
[1:18:47] God they're right there
[1:18:49] why because you know what the word you
[1:18:52] you take it you hear this tonight then
[1:18:54] you go and you study the word brother
[1:18:57] Madam says you know study the word you
[1:19:00] don't have to be a preacher to study the
[1:19:01] word of God
[1:19:02] study the word
[1:19:05] you know take something
[1:19:09] take something
[1:19:11] simple and just say well I wonder you
[1:19:13] know the power okay look we have
[1:19:16] technology today we might as might as
[1:19:18] well use it okay take the Bible app and
[1:19:21] just search a word
[1:19:23] something yeah like we're talking about
[1:19:25] the bridegroom tonight search the Bible
[1:19:26] for bride room there's a lot of awesome
[1:19:28] scriptures there don't don't try to be
[1:19:30] like oh no you know we got to be you
[1:19:32] know no technology now if it's personal
[1:19:34] preference I'm not talking about that
[1:19:36] I'm talking about you try to make it
[1:19:37] like you know it's it's non-spiritual to
[1:19:40] use your your computer
[1:19:42] um I believe we've grown beyond that
[1:19:44] you know so take the take the Bible app
[1:19:47] and and look up a word and see it
[1:19:50] through the scriptures
[1:19:51] and when you do that
[1:19:53] one jumps to the next
[1:19:57] and then to the next and guess what

[1:20:05] say my ass grass is good you ever see
[1:20:07] your horse gray say
[1:20:09] move their way around right the grass
[1:20:12] the good grass leads to more good grass
[1:20:15] the good word leads to more good word
[1:20:18] and then you come to church and the
[1:20:20] preacher preaches what you read
[1:20:23] why you're eating the book
[1:20:29] we lack
[1:20:31] because we don't
[1:20:34] we lack
[1:20:36] we want Victory we you know and we we
[1:20:38] focus on that thing and I'm gonna tear
[1:20:41] that down and and we leave the word over
[1:20:43] here
[1:20:45] don't worry about the Philistines that's
[1:20:48] feed on God
[1:20:50] next thing you know you come to yourself
[1:20:52] killing a hundred by yourself
[1:20:57] hey you pulled this sermon this
[1:20:59] direction
[1:21:03] so he says let us be glad and rejoice
[1:21:05] and give honor to him for the marriage
[1:21:07] of the Lamb is come and his wife hath
[1:21:09] made herself ready and to her was
[1:21:12] granted that she should be arrayed in
[1:21:14] Finland and clean and white for the fine
[1:21:16] linen is the righteousness of saints
[1:21:19] oh God Amen and he saith unto me right
[1:21:22] blessed are they which are called unto
[1:21:24] the marriage supper of the Lamb see if
[1:21:27] we're going to a marriage supper but
[1:21:29] that's like that's like uh the reception
[1:21:33] but we're married but it's it's
[1:21:34] different than the reception because we
[1:21:36] received the seed so
[1:21:37] but there's a marriage supper coming a
[1:21:39] celebration of the marriage
[1:21:41] but we are we are one with him
[1:21:44] that's not my words go search it through
[1:21:46] the message one with him or the two are
[1:21:48] one
[1:21:50] the thing of it is saints of God
[1:21:51] everything we get in the Bible
[1:21:54] surrounds marriage
[1:21:58] now I'm gonna say something that might
[1:21:59] sound a little bit crazy but just chew
[1:22:01] on it you don't need the Bible in heaven
[1:22:05] that's right
[1:22:07] so if it's written here
[1:22:10] you need it here
[1:22:13] don't look for it to come like I said
[1:22:15] this is it don't look for it to come
[1:22:17] it's yours for the taking don't think
[1:22:20] something more has to happen for you to
[1:22:22] get more of the word it's ready for you
[1:22:25] all you have to do is say God let me eat
[1:22:28] the book
[1:22:29] God I'm hungry let me eat the book show
[1:22:33] me the next Port show me where to take
[1:22:34] the next bite
[1:22:39] don't sit around waiting for something
[1:22:41] else to happen don't sit around waiting
[1:22:44] for another Dynamic service
[1:22:45] don't sit around waiting for Family Camp
[1:22:48] in June get the book now and then you'll
[1:22:51] enjoy Family Camp in June a whole lot
[1:22:53] better
[1:22:55] because when you put off getting what
[1:22:57] God's given to you you will live in
[1:23:00] misery
[1:23:02] but when you say God
[1:23:04] let me take it
[1:23:05] and it will be bitter in your belly
[1:23:09] it'll be better on your belly
[1:23:13] but at that point
[1:23:15] it's already in you
[1:23:17] and you can't help it a woman get oh a
[1:23:20] woman says I want to have a baby
[1:23:23] come on let's have another baby okay
[1:23:26] all right what happened to the baby and
[1:23:28] she gets pregnant in the morning
[1:23:31] see it's better but there's nothing she
[1:23:35] can do about it it's happened it's there
[1:23:38] it's coming right the pain and birth
[1:23:41] she doesn't like it but there's nothing
[1:23:43] she can do about it you eat the book
[1:23:45] it's sweet as honey right so you'll keep
[1:23:48] going for more and then it gets inside
[1:23:50] of you well it's inside of you
[1:23:53] it's going to live itself through you
[1:23:56] whether you want it to or not
[1:23:59] and we wanted to
[1:24:01] but sometimes it's hard you think about
[1:24:03] a grass you know just it grows through
[1:24:05] everything
[1:24:07] pushes through concrete
[1:24:10] what is it pushing for
[1:24:12] the light
[1:24:15] it's pushing for light what is that
[1:24:18] child growing inside of a woman's womb
[1:24:20] it's pushing for the light
[1:24:23] it wants out
[1:24:25] can it go out at three weeks
[1:24:28] can they go out at 25 weeks
[1:24:31] it's got to be full term
[1:24:33] the word inside of somebody you'll look
[1:24:36] at them and you say what's their problem
[1:24:37] it's probably not full term
[1:24:42] the word of God comes to each one in
[1:24:45] different points and we talked about
[1:24:46] turning the corner each person has to
[1:24:48] come along to their point in time all we
[1:24:51] can do as mature Christians I'm claiming
[1:24:53] that you may think oh mother Chris is
[1:24:55] the farthest thing for a mature
[1:24:56] Christian I'm going to claim it
[1:24:58] you look and you say oh that's okay I'll
[1:25:02] pray for them you don't look at I don't
[1:25:03] look at my daughter Elaine and say my
[1:25:04] goodness why can't you figure out how to
[1:25:06] drive a car
[1:25:07] no
[1:25:09] say well one day
[1:25:10] mom will teach you how to drive a car
[1:25:15] it's the stage's life
[1:25:17] yeah don't excuse that in the Christian
[1:25:19] Life there's stages of life that she
[1:25:21] have to walk through and each person
[1:25:22] comes to God give us the grace
[1:25:25] give us Grace
[1:25:27] there's a song I think the Cochran
[1:25:28] family sings it he giveth more grace
[1:25:32] that's all I remember
[1:25:33] he giveth more grace
[1:25:36] and all we have to do is eat the book he
[1:25:39] said man God I really want to be more
[1:25:42] empathetic and more compassionate to
[1:25:44] your people
[1:25:45] don't go read Dr Dobson
[1:25:47] go read the Bible
[1:25:50] go eat the book now you might find good
[1:25:52] things sometimes in that stuff
[1:25:54] simple things but go go eat the book
[1:25:57] and you'll become more like God and in
[1:25:59] doing so he'll say wow have you noticed
[1:26:01] the difference in Sister Julia
[1:26:04] sorry you're just right there
[1:26:06] have you noticed the difference in
[1:26:07] Brother David
[1:26:09] right you try to okay I think I labored
[1:26:13] it enough
[1:26:15] and I fell at his feet he says unto me
[1:26:18] these are the true sayings of God
[1:26:22] man
[1:26:23] there's some scriptures in the Bible
[1:26:25] where it's just like it's like the
[1:26:27] condensed uh concentrated
[1:26:30] yeah and it you know takes one sermon
[1:26:32] per verse
[1:26:33] 10 and I fell out his feet to worship
[1:26:35] him and he said unto me seed thou do it
[1:26:38] not I am thy fellow servant and of thy
[1:26:41] Brethren that have the testimony of
[1:26:43] Jesus
[1:26:44] I put this in here because he says
[1:26:46] worship God
[1:26:49] for the testimony of Jesus is the spirit
[1:26:52] of Prophecy in other words
[1:26:54] in other words the Tet what's the
[1:26:56] testimony of Jesus the word
[1:27:00] and that is the spirit of prophet
[1:27:03] does it line up with the word oh of a
[1:27:05] prophecy came does it line up with the
[1:27:08] word if an angel come and preach
[1:27:10] anything other we just heard this from
[1:27:12] Brother George anything other than what
[1:27:13] is written here I don't care because
[1:27:16] right here is truth
[1:27:20] and if we're not careful we we read that
[1:27:22] scripture and we talk about that we say
[1:27:23] yeah it's easy it's not easy
[1:27:26] unless you're consecrated
[1:27:29] you got to be consecrated to God you got
[1:27:32] to be
[1:27:33] the further that we go along I believe
[1:27:36] the less of the world we will partake of
[1:27:39] amen now there are certain things we
[1:27:40] have to do that's part of this life
[1:27:42] but saying the less what what is the big
[1:27:45] thing in the world today everywhere you
[1:27:46] go what is it entertainment
[1:27:50] what is entertainment distraction
[1:27:55] distraction
[1:27:56] that's why we got people who are 425
[1:27:58] pounds
[1:27:59] they're distracted
[1:28:01] from being healthy
[1:28:04] that's a kind of a crude example but
[1:28:06] it's the truth
[1:28:07] you're distracted from the word of God
[1:28:11] you're gonna get fat on the world
[1:28:15] well actually if you're a Christian
[1:28:16] you're going to starve to death
[1:28:21] this all entertainment is distraction
[1:28:23] now there's some good entertainment
[1:28:26] in balance
[1:28:28] about I speak these things from personal
[1:28:30] experience
[1:28:31] say man why am I grumpy oh
[1:28:34] I'm out of balance
[1:28:35] too much of this entertainment
[1:28:38] now I'm not talking about movies with
[1:28:41] curse words
[1:28:43] clean entertainment we should be mature
[1:28:46] enough to know
[1:28:47] to know that
[1:28:49] now
[1:28:51] and I've been guilty of that too
[1:28:53] now proving his word 1964. now remember
[1:28:55] that was not Jesus talking to Abraham
[1:28:58] there that could discern the thoughts in
[1:29:00] Sarah's mind and wrapping this up behind
[1:29:01] him that was not Jesus he had not yet
[1:29:04] been born but it was a man in human
[1:29:06] flesh that Abraham called Elohim the
[1:29:09] great Almighty
[1:29:11] showing and Jesus said it as it was in
[1:29:13] the days of Sodom now watch close in the
[1:29:16] days of Sodom so will it be in the
[1:29:18] coming of the son of man when the son of
[1:29:20] man is being revealed
[1:29:22] not no more as a church see not no more
[1:29:25] the bride is called
[1:29:28] amen what happened in Matthew
[1:29:31] was it Matthew 20 22 25 what happened in
[1:29:34] Matthew 25 the bridegroom called
[1:29:37] okay so the bride has been called
[1:29:41] in that day the son of man will be
[1:29:43] revealed to join the church to the Head
[1:29:46] unite you see why there's so many
[1:29:48] problems in churches who don't believe
[1:29:51] the open Word
[1:29:53] how can you overcome the world without
[1:29:56] Christ
[1:29:58] the marriage of the Bride
[1:30:00] the bridegroom call will come right
[1:30:03] through this when the son of man will
[1:30:05] come down and come in human flesh to
[1:30:06] unite the two together
[1:30:08] okay the church has to be watched now
[1:30:11] the church has to be the word
[1:30:14] he is the word and the two unites
[1:30:16] together God isn't into whoredom
[1:30:21] so the only way the two can unite
[1:30:23] together is by a consecrated marriage
[1:30:28] and to do that it'll take the
[1:30:30] manifestation of the revealing of the
[1:30:33] son of man
[1:30:34] not a clergyman
[1:30:36] do you see what I mean see it's the son
[1:30:39] of man Jesus Christ will come down in
[1:30:41] the human flesh Among Us and will make
[1:30:42] his word so real that it'll unite the
[1:30:46] church and him as one the bride and then
[1:30:50] shall go home to the wedding supper
[1:30:52] she's already United praise God that
[1:30:56] gets me excited she's already United see
[1:30:59] we go to the wedding supper
[1:31:02] not to the marriage
[1:31:05] okay say what he said all the tapes
[1:31:08] after the seals if you're that kind of
[1:31:10] person
[1:31:13] amen
[1:31:15] excuse me I lost my spot
[1:31:18] wedding supper
[1:31:19] and she's already United okay
[1:31:23] of all the Flesh of Mighty Men calls the
[1:31:25] marriage of lamb has come but the
[1:31:26] Rapture is going to the wedding supper
[1:31:28] when the word here unites with the
[1:31:31] person and they too become one and then
[1:31:34] what does it do then ready
[1:31:36] you ready for this yes
[1:31:38] it manifests the son of man again
[1:31:43] not the church theologians
[1:31:47] it manifests the son of man again in
[1:31:50] other words you
[1:31:52] manifest amen amen bust on the man he
[1:31:55] said brother Chris we know this stuff
[1:31:57] good you're with me the son of man the
[1:32:00] word and the church becomes one whatever
[1:32:03] the son of man done he was the word the
[1:32:06] church ready the church say with me the
[1:32:09] church does the same thing a book of
[1:32:12] Acts
[1:32:15] you see you in the message today we have
[1:32:17] two sides we got the legalistic side and
[1:32:19] we got the overly Pentecostal side
[1:32:21] but you listen to both sides because you
[1:32:24] can you can do that you can listen to
[1:32:26] both sides and you say wow yeah yeah
[1:32:28] yeah and then you listen yeah yeah yeah
[1:32:29] why because they both have truth
[1:32:34] the church does the same thing in other
[1:32:36] words there should be Expressions
[1:32:39] there should be moving of the Holy
[1:32:42] Spirit
[1:32:45] don't hold the Holy Spirit back
[1:32:47] don't hold him back let him go
[1:32:49] let him Express himself through you
[1:32:52] that's the problem
[1:32:55] when you when you try to work it up
[1:32:57] you're on the far side when you hold it
[1:33:00] back as you gotta sit and yeah then
[1:33:02] you're on that side
[1:33:03] brothers and sisters please I you know
[1:33:06] what the God just the Holy Spirit just
[1:33:08] came on my heart and such a burden
[1:33:10] Monday I was Monday evening the family
[1:33:12] was away running errands and I had to
[1:33:13] work still I was making myself some
[1:33:15] dinner I just stopped and I'd say God
[1:33:18] Wednesday night liberate your people
[1:33:23] people I don't want us to hold back the
[1:33:25] moving of the Holy Spirit I don't want
[1:33:27] us to work it up either
[1:33:29] but if we're not careful
[1:33:31] we preach too hard on one side we preach
[1:33:34] so hard on the other
[1:33:36] but God liberate your people however
[1:33:39] that would be because guess what we all
[1:33:40] go through seasons of dryness
[1:33:43] we need the rain
[1:33:44] the teaching rain to come and wet a soil
[1:33:48] of Our Lives again
[1:33:50] the church does the same thing now in
[1:33:53] this in the in in closing here
[1:33:56] this day that scripture is fulfilled
[1:33:58] go that's your homework go listen to
[1:34:01] that tape

[1:34:06] is excited
[1:34:08] this is the closing of the sermon he's
[1:34:09] excited he says he read the scripture
[1:34:11] handed the Bible back to the priest and
[1:34:13] said all the eyes of the people were
[1:34:15] fastened upon him and he looked upon
[1:34:16] them and said this day this scripture is
[1:34:19] fulfilled
[1:34:20] brother Branham would get so excited and
[1:34:23] so inspired but he could never say it
[1:34:25] exactly what it is because nobody can
[1:34:29] nobody can say it exactly what it is but
[1:34:31] she's study and you pray and you begin
[1:34:33] to see wow God's saying something this
