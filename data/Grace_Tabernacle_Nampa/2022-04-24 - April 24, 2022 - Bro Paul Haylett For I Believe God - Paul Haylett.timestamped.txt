[28:46] you know we could just take that
[28:49] verse right there and just
[28:52] give me a moment and i'll interject it
[28:53] right here in my sermon
[28:56] amen you know we just get ahead of
[28:59] ourselves a little bit but you know it's
[29:00] interesting
[29:03] no matter
[29:05] who it is that god has called through
[29:06] the ages
[29:08] we look at these great men that god call
[29:12] not one of them
[29:14] come to his ministry
[29:17] already prepared
[29:18] [Music]
[29:20] every one of them
[29:22] was trained by god
[29:25] and here we are in this day and
[29:28] i can't speak for you but i can say
[29:30] there's times that you just feel lord i
[29:32] am so
[29:33] inadequate
[29:36] don't forget
[29:39] an on-time god a prayer answering god
[29:42] is also a god who's willing
[29:45] to school you in the ways of god
[29:48] and that's a beautiful thing right there
[29:50] amen let's just stand as we would go
[29:52] into our thought today
[29:54] amen
[29:55] you know i just feel led in my heart
[29:57] let's just start
[29:59] right off the bat let's just give a
[30:00] little handclap of praise and
[30:02] thanksgiving to the lord this morning we
[30:05] serve an awesome god we serve such a
[30:07] loving god a caring god a protective god
[30:11] and a provider can we say thank you this
[30:13] morning
[30:14] lord we thank you
[30:18] thank you thank you thank you hallelujah
[30:20] lord thank you for your word
[30:23] thank you for your life hallelujah
[30:26] amen
[30:29] i would like to speak to you this
[30:30] morning on the thought of
[30:32] battered
[30:34] but victorious
[30:36] and then
[30:37] as you will see it right here in the
[30:38] scripture we'll take
[30:40] as it were for
[30:42] our secondary or
[30:44] thought that we will touch on for i
[30:46] believe god
[30:47] amen you see my brother and sister
[30:50] if we're not careful we get focused on
[30:53] the battle
[30:56] but
[30:57] first off we need to remember
[30:59] he said
[31:00] you're victorious
[31:02] amen so the devil would like you to look
[31:04] at your circumstance and you'd say man
[31:05] i'm just i just fell down on my face and
[31:08] i i hope you know uh
[31:11] you know how we get up from the dinner
[31:13] table sometimes you know because your
[31:14] wife loves you so much you'll you know
[31:17] maybe you're in a restaurant or
[31:18] something and she'll be just like real
[31:19] subtle
[31:22] and you're like oh i got food on my face
[31:26] you know the devil
[31:28] he'd like to remind you you've got mud
[31:30] on your face
[31:32] but you see the washing of the water of
[31:34] the word means that we're not going to
[31:36] walk out of here with mud on our face
[31:39] we're not going to walk out of here with
[31:40] defeat written in our lives
[31:43] we're going to walk out of here with
[31:45] victory
[31:46] because that's what the word said and
[31:48] that's what's writing on his bride
[31:51] he's writing the very words of victory
[31:54] in our life that we can turn if we'll
[31:57] focus correctly we'll turn and say oh
[32:00] yeah i did
[32:01] but the lord let me overcome it amen and
[32:04] i i failed
[32:05] wait
[32:07] i found victory over that
[32:09] and that becomes the book of our lives
[32:12] that if we honestly look at the book
[32:15] we'll realize that in every portion of
[32:17] our life where once we might have had
[32:19] bitterness and anger anxiety depressions
[32:23] etc etc we can look at that and see
[32:26] there
[32:28] is now stamped over the top of all of
[32:30] that
[32:31] in the very blood of jesus christ
[32:33] victorious
[32:35] oh i tell you it makes my heart so happy
[32:38] amen battered but victorious for i
[32:40] believe god let's turn in the book of
[32:42] acts
[32:43] and just read out of the 27th chapter
[32:46] verses 22 through 25 and so good to see
[32:50] you home brother vasily
[32:52] amen
[32:53] at uh
[32:55] i don't always express it but i just
[32:56] pray for our brothers i know what it's
[32:58] like to have driven a truck find
[33:01] yourself thousands of miles away from
[33:03] home
[33:04] in a world
[33:06] that you absolutely do not relate to
[33:12] acts 27
[33:13] starting with verse 22
[33:16] and now i exhort you
[33:18] to be of good cheer i love this starts
[33:21] right off this is what i'm going to
[33:22] exhort you not to do this and not to do
[33:25] that and obey the commandments and do
[33:26] here and do there what i want to do is
[33:28] exhort you to be of good cheer
[33:32] this is paul if you recognize the
[33:34] scripture there on the ship
[33:36] amen doesn't look like too good a
[33:39] circumstance
[33:40] their little boat
[33:42] which held the you know about
[33:45] 276 men
[33:48] is being just beaten
[33:51] on the seas
[33:52] it's coming apart when you watch a
[33:54] timber snap
[33:56] and then you start to see
[33:58] the nails pull from a board and the ship
[34:00] starts to creak and groan and men rush
[34:03] from the belly of the ship and say water
[34:05] is pouring in
[34:09] but paul
[34:11] being a servant of god
[34:14] god said i know paul this is
[34:18] this is a difficult thing it will be for
[34:20] you
[34:21] but don't worry
[34:23] don't worry paul
[34:24] i'm going to send you to rome and let
[34:26] him kill you there
[34:30] did paul flee
[34:32] no sir
[34:34] no
[34:35] and now i exhort you to be of good cheer
[34:37] for there shall be no loss of any man's
[34:39] life among you
[34:41] but of the ship
[34:43] for there stood by me this night the
[34:45] angel of god
[34:47] whose i am and whom i serve
[34:51] now if we are
[34:53] as studious of this message as we should
[34:55] be
[34:56] you'll recognize
[35:00] the parallel path of these words
[35:05] saying fear not paul
[35:08] thou must be brought before caesar and
[35:10] lo god had given thee all them that sail
[35:13] with thee
[35:14] now i'm telling you my brother and
[35:15] sister god is faithful because there
[35:17] would have been men on that ship that
[35:19] would be rank heathens
[35:23] but for paul's sake
[35:25] of a testimony
[35:28] god spared a heathen
[35:32] hard men cruel men
[35:37] wherefore sirs be of good cheer
[35:40] for i
[35:41] believe god amen
[35:43] that it shall be even as it was told me
[35:46] amen amen heavenly father we stand
[35:49] before you today
[35:51] lord believing that an angel has come in
[35:54] this day
[35:55] stood next to
[35:57] a man
[35:59] but a man called of god
[36:01] father we see as the years go by that
[36:04] truly the words that were spoken
[36:07] are true
[36:09] and we believe them amen but lord i
[36:12] believe that you led me also to other
[36:15] thoughts today and
[36:17] the prophet of god talking
[36:19] about how
[36:21] man has always taken your work your move
[36:24] and raised up and honored men
[36:27] instead of you amen oh father
[36:30] lord we want to recognize the word as
[36:33] your word
[36:35] the power is your power revelation is
[36:38] your revelation we thank you father that
[36:41] you had sent an angel to stand next to
[36:44] men
[36:45] and would give them a sure word of
[36:47] prophecy
[36:49] and that they would be courageous enough
[36:51] to speak it
[36:53] believe it and act upon it now lord i
[36:56] pray today that you would let us be
[36:57] courageous enough lord to receive the
[37:00] word act upon it speak it and live it
[37:03] amen lord we thank you for this
[37:05] opportunity to come this morning lord we
[37:08] we just thank you from the depths of our
[37:10] hearts
[37:11] your name we pray amen you may be seated
[37:14] saints
[37:22] you know sometimes the lord just um
[37:25] it just works i guess you would call it
[37:28] not call it it is mysterious
[37:30] you know to wake up in the middle of the
[37:32] night and
[37:34] and uh thinking okay i'll fall asleep in
[37:37] a moment but you don't
[37:39] gives you an opportunity to just start
[37:40] going through the church and start
[37:42] praying
[37:43] for the saints and to ponder on the
[37:45] things that the lord's laid upon your
[37:47] heart and i just prayed this morning
[37:49] that i would be able to
[37:52] to speak this in the fashion as it is
[37:55] now this thought goes back
[37:57] for quite some time i
[37:59] say this in humor but i almost jumped up
[38:02] and said stop right there brother david
[38:04] on wednesday night don't you trespass
[38:07] one step further
[38:10] yes but you see but you see how god god
[38:13] has a message saints it's not brother
[38:15] chris's message it's not brother david's
[38:17] message it's not my message it's not
[38:20] william branham's message but it's his
[38:22] message and he is knitting this together
[38:26] now my brother and sister when i was a
[38:28] young kid my my grandmother being of
[38:30] that nature said it's not unmanly for a
[38:34] young boy to learn how to crochet
[38:36] and so you know at a young age i was
[38:39] quite adept i could take a crochet
[38:41] needle and i could just go along 90
[38:44] miles an hour but i never made a blanket
[38:47] so you could take that you know 50 foot
[38:49] long string that i crocheted and you
[38:51] could start at your feet and just wrap
[38:52] it around you and maybe it would work
[38:54] like a blanket but you see god is
[38:57] knitting his word together he's not
[39:00] having an independent string here and an
[39:02] independent string here but he's
[39:04] knitting all of the word together to
[39:07] come as it were to be the blanket of the
[39:09] word to wrap around you and i because
[39:12] you see he's not looking at you and i
[39:14] saints he's looking at his word and his
[39:17] word is not leaving gaps in our life
[39:19] that we say well you know i've been
[39:21] delivered of everything but you know
[39:23] armed robbery
[39:26] and so god is knitting a perfect amen
[39:29] you might say blanket of word around us
[39:32] that the fiery darts of the enemy have
[39:34] to come in contact with the word if
[39:36] we're doing our part
[39:37] and so by god's grace you know we can
[39:39] just move and and look at this and my
[39:42] brother and sister i like that verse he
[39:45] said wherefore sirs be of good cheer
[39:48] so he's exhorting them which we're gonna
[39:50] name them as it were unbelievers but
[39:53] he's exhorting them be of good cheer for
[39:55] i
[39:56] believe god and god is going to come for
[40:00] my sake for the mission he has called me
[40:03] to and god is going to take care of me
[40:06] and so therefore you're going to lose
[40:07] the ship which might
[40:09] you know represent a large investment as
[40:12] you read the scriptures there you'll see
[40:14] that uh they throw the wheat
[40:16] into the ocean
[40:18] now somebody would have just cried over
[40:21] that but you see it was there that god
[40:24] required a a physical manifestation
[40:28] to still bring the ship to the shore he
[40:31] didn't say now be of good cheer god's
[40:33] going to just take everything just lay
[40:35] down whatever no these men were
[40:37] struggling they were laboring they were
[40:39] throwing everything that they could
[40:40] throw off of the ship and as it should
[40:43] be in our life we need to labor to throw
[40:46] everything that is not going to get us
[40:48] to the shore we need to throw it out of
[40:50] our life we need to occult i tell you
[40:53] what god i'll just be transparent enough
[40:54] to tell you i i like to read some of
[40:57] these fiction kind of well written but
[41:00] fiction
[41:01] you know mystery stories of military and
[41:04] intrigue i've always liked those but as
[41:07] god just even dealt with me yesterday i
[41:10] picked one up and just sister jerry
[41:12] helping me arrange my little library
[41:14] room and i picked one up and i thought
[41:16] i'm just going to relax for a moment and
[41:18] i started to read it and i won't go into
[41:19] detail and i the thought that came to me
[41:22] why is this in my house
[41:27] i got up out of the chair
[41:30] i walked into the trash can
[41:32] and dropped it in the trash can
[41:35] oh oh you could have gave it to goodwill
[41:36] that someone could have got a book full
[41:38] of filth
[41:40] for free
[41:44] but god dealing with me that's it
[41:46] brother
[41:50] lighten the ship
[41:52] the shore is in sight
[41:54] and god didn't promise to calm the sea
[41:57] so you could come to that shore
[41:59] there can be a tempters right to the
[42:01] very moment that we reach the shore
[42:04] but god requires for us to throw
[42:06] everything that's not godly everything
[42:09] that's not necessary to lighten the ship
[42:11] amen
[42:14] amen amen amen
[42:16] we look here
[42:18] paul's vision
[42:20] think about paul
[42:22] killing the christians
[42:25] a great commission with great sincerity
[42:28] he is pursuing what he believed was his
[42:31] calling with a fervency not known to
[42:34] many men
[42:38] but god strikes him down and when god is
[42:40] done with him sends him to the backside
[42:42] of the desert
[42:44] and what does he do he untrains god
[42:49] i mean untrain's gone god untrained paul
[42:52] excuse me
[42:54] god untrains paul
[42:56] on the side of a desert
[43:00] and through that training
[43:02] paul believed
[43:03] now you say he already believed or he
[43:05] wouldn't went through the back side of
[43:06] the desert but my brother and sister let
[43:08] it let me put it this way you can have
[43:11] doctrine
[43:12] correct doctrine without revelation
[43:17] but if you have revelation revelation of
[43:20] god will take you to the correct
[43:21] doctrine amen
[43:23] that's what brother branham's talking
[43:25] about of right attitude
[43:27] right spirit
[43:30] some people are like oh oh these people
[43:32] around the message they have such a good
[43:34] spirit oh oh but their doctrine stinks
[43:37] and it stunk for 20 years and i pray god
[43:39] delivers them their doctrine because
[43:41] it's against the word of god but people
[43:43] misconstrued what the prophet said and
[43:45] thought because these people were so
[43:47] nice and sweet my brother and sister god
[43:49] wants us to have the right doctrine and
[43:51] he wants us to have the right spirit
[43:53] amen not one or the other not some dose
[43:56] of one or the other but to have the
[43:58] right doctrine and to have the right
[44:00] spirit and god delivers paul from the
[44:04] wrong spirit
[44:06] and the wrong doctrine
[44:10] imagine that so instead of casting these
[44:12] people off with the wheat
[44:14] let's pray for them amen
[44:16] that those that have these things that
[44:18] won't line up with the word they don't
[44:19] fit it's not my opinion my brother and
[44:21] sister it simply don't fit in the word
[44:24] so pray for them that god would deal
[44:27] with their heart and deal kindly with
[44:29] their heart and so here paul is now on
[44:31] the backside of the desert god is
[44:33] training him and as it is training
[44:36] sometimes saints is untraining so in the
[44:39] training god is taking certain things
[44:41] away from us to put us in the correct
[44:44] position that future training now it's
[44:47] really funny i give this just a little
[44:49] analogy it's actually a very lovely
[44:51] memory for me that quite a few years ago
[44:53] we went to sun lakes and uh it was a fun
[44:57] time it was good brother jay it's his
[44:59] fault look everybody at brother j his
[45:01] fault anyway um you know uh they're like
[45:05] come on we're we're gonna go and and sun
[45:07] lakes you have to understand their
[45:08] little golf course is literally like a
[45:10] cow pasture
[45:11] and uh he says come on paul do this do
[45:13] this so i go out there and and i'm
[45:15] hitting the ball pretty good
[45:19] but brother jay looks over brother jason
[45:20] looks over and he goes brother paul um
[45:22] i'm surprised you haven't broken your
[45:24] wrist by now
[45:25] and i'm like what are you talking about
[45:26] he says because you're holding the golf
[45:28] club entirely wrong
[45:31] and when i say i was hitting the ball
[45:32] pretty good i'm not like boasting like
[45:34] oh i hit it right there but they were at
[45:36] least you know headed in that direction
[45:40] and he says no this is how you're
[45:41] supposed to hold the golf club
[45:45] i'm like
[45:47] okay i want to do it right
[45:50] do you know
[45:52] i believe i know i'm exaggerating but i
[45:54] could almost hit a ball golf ball in a
[45:56] 360.
[46:03] wow maybe i need to face this direction
[46:10] but one thing that drove home the
[46:11] brothers brother jay especially i think
[46:13] he felt like he had a special license
[46:16] he's like paul if you don't hold it
[46:18] correctly now
[46:20] you'll never
[46:22] be able to do it right
[46:25] you see at the moment
[46:27] i had my way
[46:28] and i said see my way gets results
[46:33] but to move forward i needed to learn
[46:36] how to do it correctly
[46:39] can anybody say oh i see that in my life
[46:42] i see that in my life god's stopping us
[46:44] we think it's working god's stopping us
[46:47] and saying no i need to train you
[46:49] correctly because you'll reach a point
[46:52] in your way
[46:54] that you'll never progress any further
[46:57] oh let me remind you that at that little
[46:59] deal up there all of the things were
[47:02] hitting the ball were not real far right
[47:04] so when i'd hit the ball
[47:06] and it would just start
[47:08] to veer off
[47:10] and it landed on the green we were okay
[47:13] but when you have to hit the ball a long
[47:15] ways like from here to eternity
[47:19] a little deviation right here
[47:24] so we look how god was working on paul
[47:26] because you see paul could not preach
[47:28] any deviation
[47:30] paul could not come just close with the
[47:33] gospel but god called paul to lay a
[47:36] bedrock a foundation
[47:38] that a whole church would be built on
[47:40] and we'll time together here in just a
[47:42] minute uh if god's gracious so we see
[47:45] now as god's doing that and you know
[47:47] what god's doing here states what god's
[47:49] training us today we can say well he's
[47:50] training me here training me here but
[47:52] you know one of the biggest factors
[47:53] god's training us today is to look
[47:56] beyond this flesh
[47:59] now tell me that is not hard
[48:01] tell me that is not a great battle to
[48:05] look beyond
[48:06] this flesh
[48:14] we could use a lot of examples opinion
[48:16] being one of those
[48:18] and if all of you would just listen to
[48:20] my opinion you would be better off
[48:23] until you're not
[48:27] you see but we build upon this flesh we
[48:29] build upon our own ideas we build beyond
[48:33] the realm of hey this is just nothing
[48:36] and we start to flesh it out until we
[48:38] create it to be something
[48:42] and god comes along and says you know
[48:43] what you're my sons and daughters of god
[48:45] and i have anointed you yes anointed you
[48:48] to receive the word in its entirety to
[48:52] be fleshed out as sons and daughters of
[48:54] god to receive a power that the world
[48:58] knows nothing of to have not only
[49:01] creative power but to have a rapturing
[49:04] faith which is a power that came from
[49:06] the word amen and so we cannot just be
[49:09] close on these things god has a
[49:11] requirement that we would also
[49:14] come down that every detail
[49:17] is important
[49:19] amen
[49:27] now this would be very subjective by a
[49:29] lot of different terms but
[49:33] i would ask you this morning what do you
[49:34] think our training is this morning
[49:38] feel free to speak out if you'd like to
[49:41] it's actually quite simple
[49:44] the prophet of god used it as a theme
[49:46] song
[49:50] do you know really that's the training
[49:51] god's not training us to be some
[49:53] supernatural warrior not training us to
[49:56] be theologians you're not training us to
[49:58] be a dominant
[50:00] to those around it god's training us
[50:02] saints
[50:04] to only believe
[50:06] now all of those attributes that you
[50:08] will need to defeat satan comes from
[50:11] believing amen
[50:14] that's right
[50:15] we can put it all down we say well this
[50:17] brother has a gift of discernment this
[50:18] brother lays hands on people prays for
[50:21] them amen you know and we see in this
[50:24] man my brother and sister for that to be
[50:26] manifested in their life as a true gift
[50:28] of god they have to believe the word in
[50:30] its entirety
[50:32] not one jot or tittle can be left out
[50:37] or
[50:38] added
[50:41] amen
[50:42] so you see our training is to believe
[50:44] and
[50:46] sometimes it comes so simple that we
[50:48] kind of miss it we kind of get caught up
[50:50] in the battle and you know the lord's
[50:51] words to us uh forgive me i'm just going
[50:54] to paraphrase a few things this morning
[50:56] but you see in our training the lord's
[50:59] words to us is i'll be with you even in
[51:02] you to the end of the world
[51:06] do we believe that see that ought to be
[51:08] something so anchored within our souls
[51:11] that we we can't even believe the devil
[51:14] because the devil's going to come and in
[51:16] his subtle way he's going to try and get
[51:19] us to just hesitate amen
[51:24] just to hesitate
[51:26] all it takes
[51:28] to strike out a batter
[51:31] when the ball is thrown to him is for
[51:32] him just to hesitate
[51:35] he can see where the ball is coming he
[51:38] knows he can hit that ball but if he
[51:40] hesitates
[51:42] that 98 or whatever mile an hour ball
[51:45] will already be in the pitchers
[51:47] i mean the catcher's mitt
[51:51] when his hesitation is resolved to move
[51:53] forward
[51:54] that's why the prophet of god said only
[51:56] believe
[51:57] don't let any anything
[51:59] as i said i'm
[52:01] kind of paraphrasing kind of bringing
[52:02] this out so don't don't hold me to the
[52:04] exact words this morning that's why the
[52:06] prophet of god said for you to not
[52:09] hesitate on the word but say amen
[52:13] when the word comes forth say amen and
[52:16] god will put it down in the bedrock now
[52:18] my brother and sister you've been given
[52:20] a supernatural filter
[52:22] amen a lot of talk in the age that we
[52:24] live in people talking about well we
[52:26] don't believe we don't listen to
[52:27] preachers because we don't want to have
[52:29] to run a filter
[52:34] they're deceiving themselves
[52:36] they're deceiving themselves
[52:39] god called you
[52:41] to have a filter
[52:44] god did not say i'm going to send my
[52:45] bride into laodicea without a filter
[52:48] amen
[52:51] what is the filter
[52:53] the holy ghost
[52:55] so when you hear people say i i just
[52:57] want to listen to a tape because i don't
[52:59] have to have a filter they're actually
[53:01] saying i can listen to this tape and i
[53:03] don't have to worry about whether i have
[53:05] the holy ghost or not
[53:07] i want the filter
[53:09] i want god to come down and so
[53:11] supernaturally annoying to us that we
[53:14] without hesitation know what is the word
[53:18] we can recognize and discern it is true
[53:21] or it is false
[53:31] i believe this
[53:35] whether i'm on top of the mountain or in
[53:36] a swamp
[53:39] he's with me amen
[53:41] right whether i'm having one of the best
[53:42] days of my life or i'm having one of the
[53:44] worst days of my life he's with me amen
[53:48] amen it's his voice it says you've done
[53:51] wrong correct it it's his voice it says
[53:54] hey don't look at the mud i'm here to
[53:57] wash you by the word
[54:00] he's the one that's with us my brother
[54:02] and sister
[54:03] we can be battered but victorious
[54:06] amen you know
[54:08] as the one song says must we
[54:10] oh how does that go flowery beds of ease
[54:13] well there's fought
[54:16] sailed bloody seas yes
[54:19] the words are going by so fast i can't i
[54:21] can't grasp them
[54:24] those saints my brother and sister
[54:25] people are like oh praise the lord we've
[54:27] just always walked so so steady in the
[54:30] word
[54:31] i'd have to wonder if the devil knows
[54:36] if he's leaving you alone
[54:40] he knows
[54:42] come on saints hear me
[54:45] if the devil knows that you are a
[54:46] predestinated son of god he's not going
[54:49] to walk away from you he's going to
[54:52] chomp down every briar branch he can
[54:54] throw in your path he's going to drop
[54:56] every rock he can in the trail before
[54:58] you he's going to put every circumstance
[55:00] in your life he's going to put it to
[55:02] where you feel like i can't go no
[55:04] further only to get up and go
[55:07] hey he is afraid of you saints
[55:10] amen but if satan's not touching your
[55:12] life and you are just going so flowery
[55:15] bit of ease you ought to be actually
[55:17] afraid
[55:20] this bride of christ will be battered
[55:23] but the word says emphatically she's
[55:26] victorious
[55:27] don't look at the scars that you have
[55:29] don't look at the struggles you've had
[55:31] don't look at the past my brother and
[55:33] sister you will be battered but you will
[55:36] be victorious
[55:38] this is the promise of the word in our
[55:40] day
[55:41] amen
[55:43] hallelujah
[55:44] ii corinthians
[55:46] the fourth chapter the seventh verse
[55:50] amen go ahead brother mason put that up
[55:52] okay
[55:53] but we have
[55:55] this treasure what is that treasure
[55:58] it's him amen it's him my brother and
[56:01] sister we don't have any other treasure
[56:04] look think about this take this back to
[56:06] paul on the ship
[56:08] the vision doesn't save the ship
[56:14] the vision
[56:17] saves the other vessel
[56:21] amen i mean the holy ghost my my
[56:23] thoughts are just racing this morning
[56:24] forgive me
[56:25] the holy ghost doesn't save that ship
[56:27] there that paul's riding on it saved the
[56:29] other vessel
[56:30] now look at this but we have this
[56:33] treasure in earthen vessels
[56:36] that's us right
[56:37] that the excellency of the power may be
[56:39] of god and not of us you see how in one
[56:42] sentence god takes it and says you know
[56:44] what i actually let you slip on that
[56:46] banana peel every once in a while
[56:48] because it's a reminder to you that you
[56:51] can't do it but i'm right here to keep
[56:55] you
[56:56] right here to keep you
[56:58] we are
[57:00] i just
[57:01] with a little liberty some words today
[57:04] we are battered
[57:07] on every side
[57:10] yet not distressed
[57:12] let me read it correctly we are troubled
[57:14] on every side yet not distressed we are
[57:17] perplexed
[57:23] what is being perplexed my brother and
[57:25] sister always knowing exactly what
[57:28] everything is and we just got it figured
[57:30] out and i read the message and i say i
[57:33] believe it and so therefore the devil
[57:34] can't touch me
[57:36] no sir
[57:38] perplexed is when you can be in church
[57:40] and the holy spirit move upon you and
[57:42] you are moved to the very fiber of your
[57:45] being and walk out and the devil slam
[57:47] the door in your face
[57:50] and you say how can that be lord
[57:52] how can that be
[57:55] god's allowing this you see because the
[57:57] worst thing we can do
[57:59] is think our vessel
[58:01] doesn't need him
[58:05] when we get to the place our vessel in
[58:07] our mind doesn't need him
[58:10] you know you're totally lost
[58:13] you see so god's allowing these we're
[58:14] troubled on every side yet not
[58:16] distressed we are perplexed but not in
[58:18] despair
[58:20] what is the paradox of life my brother
[58:22] and sister
[58:23] look at the prophet i want to bring this
[58:25] as an example i actually experienced
[58:27] this in my own body
[58:29] in south america uh years ago the
[58:32] prophet of god is now
[58:34] there's a lot of circumstances those
[58:36] events in africa that bring up to this
[58:38] but the prophet of god is there with a
[58:40] pain that burns like fire in his belly
[58:44] and he is praying for people and they
[58:47] are healed and delivered here is when
[58:50] you're perplexed brother branham is
[58:52] asking god
[58:53] why lord why are you're healing them but
[58:57] there's times i i can't even bear this
[59:00] pain in my own body why lord
[59:05] i guess i must not be
[59:07] god's prophet
[59:09] i must not be a christian
[59:16] what did god do
[59:17] some of you will be able to say amen to
[59:19] this
[59:20] god let
[59:21] that pain
[59:24] amoebas and whatever
[59:26] god use that to move brother branham
[59:30] over to another position
[59:35] but i prayed the brothers prayed for me
[59:37] that god would heal me
[59:39] let go
[59:40] and let god have his way
[59:43] don't dig down poor concrete shackle a
[59:45] big chain to it wrap the chain around
[59:47] you i won't be moved no god might be
[59:50] trying to move you to another position
[59:53] i must not have enough faith to be
[59:54] healed maybe god wants to move you to
[59:57] another position let it move you
[1:00:01] right amen you say but what do we do
[1:00:03] brother paul
[1:00:05] you stand on the unshakable word of god
[1:00:07] get up every morning and say i'm healed
[1:00:09] in the name of jesus christ
[1:00:12] i don't care if the pain doubles you
[1:00:13] over i don't care if the headaches
[1:00:16] bother you i don't care if the backaches
[1:00:18] bother you the hypocrite bothers you the
[1:00:21] footage hurts so
[1:00:23] i'm healed in the name of jesus christ
[1:00:26] because i've been given an unshakeable
[1:00:28] anchor but it's not in this flesh it's
[1:00:31] here in this word
[1:00:33] so look at this
[1:00:35] distressed we're perplexed but not in
[1:00:37] despair persecuted but not forsaken cast
[1:00:40] down but not destroyed
[1:00:43] always bearing about in the body the
[1:00:46] dying of the lord jesus
[1:00:48] that's right
[1:00:50] amen aren't you glad actually i'm going
[1:00:52] to say this boldly aren't you glad that
[1:00:54] god doesn't require you to be nailed to
[1:00:57] a cross to pay the debt of your life but
[1:01:00] allowed you in this realm to simply
[1:01:02] claim that blood accept that blood and
[1:01:05] act upon that blood so god allows it we
[1:01:08] say oh you know it's been so hard
[1:01:10] serving the lord really
[1:01:15] really
[1:01:16] we don't know pain
[1:01:18] we don't know suffering
[1:01:20] we don't know despair
[1:01:22] none of us have sat in the garden and
[1:01:25] sweated out great drops of blood
[1:01:30] there's actually a medical term or
[1:01:32] terminology concerning that and it can
[1:01:35] happen in humans
[1:01:37] but they say that the stress level
[1:01:39] must be so high
[1:01:42] it is borderline
[1:01:44] to death that's exactly right
[1:01:48] it's so hard to serve the lord
[1:01:52] most of us are allergic to sweating
[1:01:55] much less sweating blood that's right i
[1:01:57] don't mean not harsh that might not have
[1:01:59] come out right that's right
[1:02:02] always bearing about the body the dying
[1:02:04] of the lord jesus that the life also of
[1:02:06] jesus might be made manifest in our body
[1:02:09] i i'd like to see a hand not for me but
[1:02:11] for the lord who wants to see the life
[1:02:14] of christ manifest in this body
[1:02:17] i want to see the reality of a living
[1:02:20] savior a god who loved us so much that
[1:02:23] before there was even an earth he said i
[1:02:26] put it all in place for you paul i put
[1:02:28] it all in place for you trevor i put it
[1:02:31] all in place for you amen oh hallelujah
[1:02:35] for we which live are always delivered
[1:02:38] unto death for jesus sake that the life
[1:02:40] also of jesus might be made manifest oh
[1:02:44] see the separation here saints
[1:02:46] there's a separation here the apostle
[1:02:49] paul
[1:02:50] he caught that
[1:02:52] and anointed of the word to lay it down
[1:02:54] so we could read it see it's one thing
[1:02:56] to be manifest in our body but this is
[1:02:59] in a spiritual context and he brings it
[1:03:02] down and ties this same suffering and
[1:03:04] his same sacrifice to mortal flesh
[1:03:07] so we can't go out living any old kind
[1:03:09] of life immortal flesh that's kind of
[1:03:12] one of the foundations that two soul
[1:03:14] doctrine people actually use well
[1:03:15] there's separation
[1:03:17] there's mortal flesh and then there's a
[1:03:18] spiritual me
[1:03:20] that mortal guy he lies cheats steals
[1:03:23] drinks gambles
[1:03:25] but my spiritual man doesn't
[1:03:29] come on saints
[1:03:32] the devil
[1:03:34] oh hallelujah i'll wait on that
[1:03:37] lord please remind me
[1:03:39] okay let's turn in acts 28 we're kind of
[1:03:42] did a roundabout thing here so please
[1:03:44] forgive me
[1:03:45] follow this though
[1:03:48] and when they were escaped
[1:03:50] then they knew that the island was
[1:03:52] called malia and the barbarians people
[1:03:55] so not not a christian they didn't fall
[1:03:57] amongst christians they fell amongst
[1:04:00] barbarians
[1:04:02] i have a bunch of friends
[1:04:04] that i've fallen into over life
[1:04:07] and i don't mean to sound like i'm
[1:04:09] banging on them but they're barbarians
[1:04:14] they are plain and simple barbarians
[1:04:17] we're talking about men
[1:04:19] that don't think anything
[1:04:21] about god
[1:04:22] ever
[1:04:29] yeah
[1:04:32] but time changes barbarians also
[1:04:36] and the barbarians people showed us no
[1:04:38] little kindness for they kindled the
[1:04:40] fire and received us everyone because of
[1:04:43] the present rain and because of the cold
[1:04:46] and when paul had gathered a bundle of
[1:04:48] sticks and laid them on the fire there
[1:04:50] came a viper out of the heat and
[1:04:52] fastened on his hand
[1:04:55] oh
[1:04:55] i hope i don't forget to share that i
[1:04:57] didn't put the quote in my sermon but i
[1:04:59] just have to share that and when the
[1:05:00] barbarians saw the venomous beast hang
[1:05:03] on his hand they said amongst themselves
[1:05:05] no doubt this man is a murderer
[1:05:09] yeah
[1:05:11] whom though he hath escaped the sea yet
[1:05:13] vengeance suffereth not to live and he
[1:05:16] shook off the beast into the fire and
[1:05:18] felt no harm howbeit they looked when he
[1:05:20] should have swollen or fallen down dead
[1:05:23] suddenly but after they had looked a
[1:05:25] great a while and saw no harm come to
[1:05:28] him they changed their minds
[1:05:31] even barbarians can change their minds
[1:05:35] oh praise the lord if he sends a
[1:05:37] barbarian into our church saints pray
[1:05:39] for them give them time to change their
[1:05:42] mind amen
[1:05:45] amen
[1:05:47] saw no harm come to him they changed
[1:05:48] their minds and said that he was
[1:05:51] a god
[1:05:53] oh look at this supernatural my brother
[1:05:55] and sister everything that happened in
[1:05:57] those scriptures right there how it come
[1:06:00] to bring paul to this place in front of
[1:06:02] those people to stand and to come and
[1:06:06] see the word manifested through his life
[1:06:08] this is supernatural
[1:06:10] this is supernatural my brother and
[1:06:12] sister
[1:06:13] amen it is there that we see how god is
[1:06:17] choosing to bring the word in a realm
[1:06:20] that these people
[1:06:22] could understand
[1:06:23] paul didn't walk off in great flowing
[1:06:26] gowns off of a ship and then start to
[1:06:28] tell them you are heathens you don't
[1:06:31] believe in christ you must do they no
[1:06:33] doubt had no idea who jesus christ was
[1:06:37] but god knew how to get through their
[1:06:39] armor
[1:06:40] god knew how to put paul
[1:06:44] on the ship
[1:06:45] and batter him as he fasted day and
[1:06:48] night batter him god didn't say i'm
[1:06:51] going to put you on a gyro inside the
[1:06:53] ship that you won't feel anything
[1:06:55] everything will be just perfect in your
[1:06:56] world no sir when that ship crashed down
[1:06:58] and when that ship rolled over on its
[1:07:00] side don't you think paul was a human
[1:07:02] when he was there and he's looking at
[1:07:04] the water right here and the side of the
[1:07:06] ship is up here that a human element
[1:07:08] would say oh it's all done it's all done
[1:07:10] but paul was stepped into a realm my
[1:07:13] brother and sister that is possible for
[1:07:15] you and i to step into and that is a
[1:07:18] complete trust a complete faith in god
[1:07:21] and paul wasn't on the ship going oh
[1:07:24] help me
[1:07:26] but paul prayed
[1:07:28] 14 days
[1:07:32] amen that's right
[1:07:36] cannot be kind of straightforward
[1:07:38] amen
[1:07:39] if i ever hear
[1:07:43] a word out of you as your pastor i say
[1:07:45] this in love i don't only say this
[1:07:47] harshly i ever hear a word out of you
[1:07:49] that god doesn't answer prayers
[1:07:51] be prepared for me to ask you if you've
[1:07:53] been praying 14 days straight
[1:07:58] isn't that fair
[1:08:01] see god required it of paul
[1:08:04] and god gave him
[1:08:06] the results
[1:08:11] through the years i've had people come
[1:08:13] and say brother paul i've been praying
[1:08:14] about this
[1:08:16] god hasn't given me an answer
[1:08:20] i didn't used to be so bold most of you
[1:08:22] probably noticed that i'm getting to the
[1:08:23] point
[1:08:25] i say this in a correct fashion but
[1:08:27] i'm getting to the point i don't really
[1:08:29] care
[1:08:31] he used to be concerned about hurting
[1:08:33] feelings and
[1:08:35] buttering everybody up so that you know
[1:08:38] it's just good
[1:08:40] but we're seeing that nations are
[1:08:42] breaking
[1:08:44] we're seeing every sign that's promised
[1:08:46] to the word and it's time for us to put
[1:08:48] feeling here
[1:08:50] and be concerned what it will feel like
[1:08:51] to stand before our lord and savior
[1:08:54] amen
[1:08:54] will we feel overwhelming joy
[1:08:57] or will we feel
[1:08:58] overwhelming sadness and agony
[1:09:01] that's the only feelings
[1:09:03] that i'm
[1:09:04] coming except for when i feel bad that's
[1:09:07] different
[1:09:12] no some of you are thinking that he
[1:09:13] don't understand mine
[1:09:15] he just knew what i went through no i'm
[1:09:17] sorry that's right god don't care that's
[1:09:20] right god don't care
[1:09:24] i don't know why i said that
[1:09:28] so here is paul now
[1:09:30] all he's been through god introduces a
[1:09:33] serpent
[1:09:34] out of the wood
[1:09:36] and it latches on to paul's hand
[1:09:39] and paul is there now oh my brother and
[1:09:42] sister if you want to know where god's
[1:09:43] viewing this you want to know the
[1:09:44] foundation where brother branham said
[1:09:46] about the hot grease it all depends on
[1:09:48] whether you fear it or not your reaction
[1:09:50] to the hot grease will determine whether
[1:09:53] it hurts you or not it comes right here
[1:09:55] and god established it right in the
[1:09:56] scripture right here and this serpent
[1:09:59] leaps as it were out of the wood out of
[1:10:01] the fire and it latches on to paul's
[1:10:03] hand and my goodness the the the
[1:10:05] barbarians looked and thought that guy's
[1:10:08] gone no doubt they could say that's a
[1:10:10] that's a this a viper this and or
[1:10:12] whatever that is and and that whatever
[1:10:14] it is they're not like oh okay well
[1:10:16] it'll be no they're looking for him to
[1:10:17] start staggering
[1:10:18] hand to start swelling up the arm and
[1:10:20] just fall over
[1:10:22] it really does happen that fast with
[1:10:23] some snakes
[1:10:25] and so they're looking to that
[1:10:28] paul was looking to christ
[1:10:32] paul wasn't looking to a viper that was
[1:10:34] hanging on his hand
[1:10:35] paul wasn't looking to didn't the
[1:10:37] preacher say one time that
[1:10:39] no it was so ingrained in paul i don't
[1:10:42] have time this morning to give it all i
[1:10:44] might have put it in there but it's so
[1:10:46] ingrained brother branham says paul was
[1:10:48] so full of the holy ghost that that
[1:10:51] viper could not inject its venom in him
[1:10:57] oh it might have actually punctured his
[1:10:59] skin and put the venom in there but
[1:11:01] there's a difference my brother and
[1:11:02] sister i'll get ahead of myself here but
[1:11:04] you have been snake bit
[1:11:07] you're in laodicea the serpent is
[1:11:09] present my brother and sister you have
[1:11:11] been snake bit but it's a matter of how
[1:11:14] you receive the bite of the serpent as
[1:11:17] what happens in your life
[1:11:20] oh
[1:11:21] so look at this i want to jump over a
[1:11:23] little further here real quick i want to
[1:11:25] keep going
[1:11:26] you know jesus was bit by the serpent
[1:11:29] amen
[1:11:32] in that day the serpent manifested
[1:11:34] itself as a religious spirit
[1:11:38] and it bit him and we can say oh my oh
[1:11:41] my our lord jesus but you see my brother
[1:11:44] and sister god wants the word to be
[1:11:46] fulfilled more than he cares about
[1:11:49] feelings
[1:11:52] he didn't say jesus are you okay with
[1:11:54] this
[1:11:57] but go read your bible
[1:12:01] jesus cried out
[1:12:03] in his moments of turmoil
[1:12:06] lord
[1:12:08] not
[1:12:09] my will
[1:12:12] what was he doing dying to flesh amen
[1:12:15] he was giving this flesh over in the
[1:12:18] ultimate sacrifice
[1:12:20] not my will because our will would be
[1:12:23] flowery beds of ease
[1:12:25] but lord
[1:12:27] thy will be done
[1:12:29] and so he lets as it is i hope you could
[1:12:31] see this he lets this serpent of the
[1:12:34] religious spirits you see my brother and
[1:12:35] sister it was church
[1:12:37] it was church that killed jesus
[1:12:40] now we can argue it was our sins that he
[1:12:43] was paying for but i want you to
[1:12:44] understand the steps or the progress
[1:12:46] which god brought it by to bring the
[1:12:48] word to pass for you and i and they
[1:12:51] thought they were accomplishing
[1:12:52] something because we're crucifying this
[1:12:54] man and it was the religious spirit of
[1:12:56] the day that was what the serpent came
[1:12:58] in that day was a religious spirit come
[1:13:02] in there and said wow this guy makes
[1:13:04] himself god
[1:13:06] he blasphemes he has they have eaten on
[1:13:09] the sabbath they have done this they
[1:13:11] have done that this can't be and we
[1:13:14] reject it but yet their own admission by
[1:13:17] some of their own men said we know that
[1:13:19] thou earth the christ
[1:13:21] what is it
[1:13:23] a public image
[1:13:27] and inside the closed doors
[1:13:29] image
[1:13:32] now i hope this doesn't offend anybody
[1:13:33] but you see that's still going on today
[1:13:35] yes it is we have people and i don't
[1:13:37] believe it's here in our church
[1:13:39] god help us
[1:13:41] in all honesty and love i say god help
[1:13:43] us if a spirit would be here but you see
[1:13:46] the outside one was like oh yes yes
[1:13:49] god bless you love you
[1:13:51] the other one doesn't care
[1:13:53] what befalls you
[1:13:54] in fact rejoices to see something before
[1:13:57] you
[1:13:58] religious spirit the serpent still got
[1:14:01] his fangs out
[1:14:03] what is he doing judas
[1:14:05] judas look at it my brother and sister
[1:14:07] you see the holy the spirit says that
[1:14:10] the spirit departed him and he was
[1:14:12] filled you know with satan's spirit
[1:14:15] my brother and sister it was there the
[1:14:17] fangs was already already there the
[1:14:19] whole time
[1:14:21] the venom
[1:14:22] was there the whole time
[1:14:24] but it brought that circumstance to
[1:14:26] bring judas to the place that he would
[1:14:28] let satan take over his body to fulfill
[1:14:30] the lord amen
[1:14:34] so jesus gets bit by this religious
[1:14:36] spirit but it's to fulfill the scripture
[1:14:39] this religious spirit this venom of the
[1:14:42] day
[1:14:43] put him in the grave
[1:14:45] but do you realize the only reason he
[1:14:46] went to the grave my brother and sister
[1:14:48] was to fulfill the prophesied word
[1:14:52] amen it was not that satan you hear
[1:14:55] religious people say well satan had
[1:14:57] power over jesus for that little short
[1:15:00] season but jesus said i lay my life down
[1:15:05] there was no i've been forced to do this
[1:15:08] there was no i've been put in an
[1:15:10] impossible situation he said i lay my
[1:15:13] life down
[1:15:15] denoting that it was his
[1:15:18] power
[1:15:19] as it were
[1:15:20] that he submitted to god
[1:15:25] now that venom should have put him there
[1:15:27] in the grave
[1:15:30] to fulfill the word
[1:15:32] should have kept him there
[1:15:38] praise the lord
[1:15:40] i get excited amen
[1:15:42] but it couldn't
[1:15:45] what was he showing us saints very
[1:15:47] simple showing us the venom
[1:15:49] of this religious world
[1:15:53] might put you in a natural grave but it
[1:15:55] won't keep you there
[1:15:57] hallelujah
[1:15:58] thank you lord
[1:15:59] thank you lord we don't have to worry
[1:16:01] about it we might die of old age or
[1:16:03] disease or whatever you know just going
[1:16:06] through the library coming across you
[1:16:07] know uh the booklet do you fear cancer
[1:16:10] oh my brother and sister it is something
[1:16:13] that just grips people i know people
[1:16:15] within the message i'm not i'm not
[1:16:16] speaking down at them but they literally
[1:16:18] they literally be like i can't eat this
[1:16:21] and i can't eat this because in
[1:16:22] california they've researched and this
[1:16:24] causes cancer so i won't do this and i'm
[1:16:26] thinking where are you going to find on
[1:16:29] this polluted earth
[1:16:31] i took
[1:16:32] now this in the natural i took a virgin
[1:16:35] seed
[1:16:36] never been hybrid
[1:16:38] that you can
[1:16:40] tell though
[1:16:42] after all i mean i've looked at a lot of
[1:16:43] celery seeds and the ones that are
[1:16:45] hybrid are always they just stand right
[1:16:46] out
[1:16:49] corn seed that's been hybrid it just
[1:16:51] like has in fine print you know oh it
[1:16:53] says hybrid on it
[1:16:59] do you realize
[1:17:01] hybrid message
[1:17:03] is unidentifiable
[1:17:05] without the holy ghost
[1:17:07] that's exactly right without the holy
[1:17:09] ghost we'll digest it and think it was
[1:17:12] the greatest thing that ever come down
[1:17:13] the way but it takes the holy ghost to
[1:17:16] identify to us this has been hybrid
[1:17:20] this is not original this is not the
[1:17:22] word god's given us a supernatural
[1:17:24] ability to take this back to the
[1:17:27] original church and to be able to
[1:17:29] compare the two and identify the spirit
[1:17:32] of the day
[1:17:33] amen so we look at this jesus bit by the
[1:17:35] serpent paul is then bit by the serpent
[1:17:38] now i want to just give you this little
[1:17:40] bit out of this question and answers
[1:17:42] here i think of saint paul out there on
[1:17:45] the aisle after shipwreck god had given
[1:17:48] him a vision and when 14 days and nights
[1:17:51] all hopes was gone they'd ever be saved
[1:17:53] the little old boat tossing about like
[1:17:56] that and they was all crying and 14 days
[1:17:58] a night but paul was down there had a
[1:18:01] vision he came out and he said be of
[1:18:03] good courage for the angel of god whose
[1:18:05] servant i am has stood by me and said
[1:18:07] fear not for thou must be brought before
[1:18:10] caesar and lo gods give all those who
[1:18:13] sail with you and when the ship wrecked
[1:18:16] and went up on the shores and they had
[1:18:17] got over there with the natives paul was
[1:18:19] picking up some sticks and he went and
[1:18:21] laid them on the fire and there come a
[1:18:24] big
[1:18:24] serpent i've seen all kinds of
[1:18:27] depictions most of them show this little
[1:18:29] guy
[1:18:30] they'd be like could you hold still so i
[1:18:32] could bite you
[1:18:34] do you know the little blue racer it's
[1:18:36] pretty poisonous
[1:18:37] but his mouth and his
[1:18:39] fangs are so small
[1:18:40] that you pretty much have to hold your
[1:18:42] fingers open like this and relax so he
[1:18:44] can get a hold of this little piece of
[1:18:45] skin right here
[1:18:46] because otherwise he can't get you
[1:18:51] hallelujah
[1:18:53] big old serpent
[1:18:56] my brother and sister don't forget the
[1:18:57] devil's big
[1:18:59] until you put the magnification of the
[1:19:01] word upon him and you get to watch him
[1:19:03] shrank
[1:19:06] until people will serve him their whole
[1:19:09] life
[1:19:10] and see him in the sight of the pit and
[1:19:11] say
[1:19:12] this
[1:19:14] is what kept us from serving god
[1:19:17] this
[1:19:18] little thing
[1:19:22] come on
[1:19:26] amen
[1:19:27] and went up on the shores and they got
[1:19:28] over there with the natives paul picked
[1:19:29] up some sticks he went laid them on the
[1:19:31] fire and there was a big serpent grabbed
[1:19:34] him by the hand now that serpent
[1:19:36] injected poison of that in his hand that
[1:19:39] would have killed him within a minute
[1:19:41] the native said watch that fellow fall
[1:19:43] dead he'll just die in a minute
[1:19:46] yeah he'll just die
[1:19:49] in a minute amen do we have more we
[1:19:52] somehow miss the rest of that quote
[1:19:54] okay no problem
[1:19:56] no problem
[1:19:57] right here
[1:20:00] he's in chains for preaching the gospel
[1:20:02] religious people put him in chains
[1:20:05] the very finest of churches that day was
[1:20:07] what put him in chains it just wasn't
[1:20:09] the cons if if it just wasn't the
[1:20:12] constitution in the united states they'd
[1:20:14] do the same thing today
[1:20:16] that's right just wait till she's till
[1:20:18] she's broke
[1:20:19] a little more
[1:20:22] oh my goodness saints when i read that i
[1:20:26] thought lord this is your word coming to
[1:20:28] pass the prophet acknowledged it's just
[1:20:30] for the constitution they've already got
[1:20:33] all their plans made god made his plans
[1:20:35] before the foundation of the world
[1:20:36] they've been scheming since the garden
[1:20:39] with their plants
[1:20:41] and so it's there just a little bit more
[1:20:43] got to break it down just a little bit
[1:20:46] more
[1:20:48] hallelujah
[1:20:49] amen hallelujah
[1:20:52] yeah
[1:20:53] you know it's kind of interesting had
[1:20:55] this shared with us here recently
[1:20:58] that um you know they just allow you to
[1:21:00] have just as much liberty
[1:21:03] as they want to allow you to have
[1:21:05] liberty
[1:21:07] and you don't have
[1:21:08] an ounce more
[1:21:12] why they don't want a whole nation to go
[1:21:13] into an uproar
[1:21:16] you've got to be led
[1:21:18] to the point
[1:21:20] that
[1:21:23] that you've already made your decision
[1:21:26] which way you're going to go
[1:21:28] because you see if they do it before
[1:21:30] that then people can reverse their
[1:21:31] decision
[1:21:33] are you with me
[1:21:36] so what's happening
[1:21:37] the mark of the beast doesn't become
[1:21:39] manifest until people have submitted
[1:21:41] themselves either to the holy ghost
[1:21:43] or to the devil amen
[1:21:46] and it's in those seasons right
[1:21:48] just study history i did quite an
[1:21:50] extensive thing on history look from
[1:21:52] 1956 now you can find it on the internet
[1:21:55] and everything that's on google is true
[1:21:57] uh and uh you'll see how it is though
[1:22:00] but you'll see the marked
[1:22:02] increase
[1:22:04] of every kind of behaviors from 1956.
[1:22:09] yes if there was any vindication that we
[1:22:12] needed
[1:22:14] to to document or signpost this my
[1:22:16] brother and sister
[1:22:18] the world out here
[1:22:19] has produced it for us
[1:22:21] we didn't have to manufacture it
[1:22:24] abortions that's it
[1:22:26] uh uh people living together all
[1:22:29] whatever just every every you know
[1:22:32] everything there is
[1:22:33] just started ramped up right there
[1:22:36] so you see that watch that fellow fall
[1:22:38] dead he'll just die in a minute see what
[1:22:40] it's doing but now we're seeing here in
[1:22:42] the word
[1:22:43] that it's there and as it is my brother
[1:22:46] and sister god is bringing this to pass
[1:22:48] in such a fashion that this is where i
[1:22:51] brought this in earlier it's the
[1:22:52] religious people put him in the chains
[1:22:54] the finest of the churches that day put
[1:22:57] him in chains
[1:22:58] amen and a serpent grabbed him through
[1:23:00] the hand now watch paul didn't fear
[1:23:03] he said jesus christ said if they take
[1:23:05] up serpents it shall harm them
[1:23:08] so he walks over there
[1:23:10] over here
[1:23:11] shakes him off on the fire turns around
[1:23:14] walks over got some sticks put back on
[1:23:16] the fire turned around and warmed his
[1:23:18] back turned around this way and warmed
[1:23:20] his hands a native said why don't he die
[1:23:26] why
[1:23:27] when almost every holiness movement in
[1:23:30] the united states
[1:23:32] is dying from the bite of the serpent
[1:23:37] why aren't you
[1:23:39] that's it why aren't you dying
[1:23:41] why aren't we compromising why aren't we
[1:23:44] giving up why aren't we saying the
[1:23:46] culture of this day is more important in
[1:23:49] the church
[1:23:50] why
[1:23:53] why
[1:23:54] oh
[1:23:55] all i can say is thank you lord that's
[1:23:57] right amen thank you lord
[1:24:00] hallelujah
[1:24:02] my brother and sister i won't name i
[1:24:04] won't name churches
[1:24:06] i won't name things but it goes back in
[1:24:08] my past
[1:24:09] from my grandmother being there in the
[1:24:11] through the years and and uh
[1:24:13] not knowing what our futures were but a
[1:24:16] a young man named paul
[1:24:19] that i was friends with in a holiness
[1:24:21] church
[1:24:22] and a guy named paul that by the grace
[1:24:24] of god stands here before you today
[1:24:26] and to see the path that has come
[1:24:31] a good preacher
[1:24:32] a dynamic preacher
[1:24:35] and their religion
[1:24:37] changed all their rules
[1:24:39] and the scripture
[1:24:43] to keep him in the pulpit that's it
[1:24:49] do you think
[1:24:50] a church that will change its own belief
[1:24:54] to keep man in the pulpit is going to
[1:24:56] preach the truth to you
[1:25:00] let us all be judged by the pure word of
[1:25:02] god
[1:25:03] not by man's ideas
[1:25:05] not by a hierarchy but by the word amen
[1:25:09] now let me hurry and why don't he die
[1:25:12] why don't that man die he ought to drop
[1:25:15] dead but paul was so full yes here i
[1:25:17] love it
[1:25:18] paul was so full of the holy ghost see
[1:25:21] what i mean
[1:25:22] is so full of the holy ghost until the
[1:25:25] poison wouldn't poison him now look at
[1:25:28] laodicea saints the fiery bite of the
[1:25:32] serpent of laodicea is biting and biting
[1:25:36] i can show you as you would take it from
[1:25:38] my testimony i can show you the fang
[1:25:41] marks of a 15 year old that said i'm
[1:25:44] done with this
[1:25:48] i got sick for a while
[1:25:50] but the poison couldn't kill me
[1:25:54] hallelujah can somebody say amen thank
[1:25:56] you lord
[1:25:57] hallelujah
[1:26:01] tell the poison wouldn't poison him oh
[1:26:03] brother
[1:26:04] give me a church
[1:26:06] full of the holy ghost and god will do
[1:26:08] in one year what all the theologists
[1:26:11] failed to do in 2000 years you wait
[1:26:14] until the anointing of the church really
[1:26:16] strikes home to that faithful little
[1:26:18] remnant after the doors of the gentiles
[1:26:20] is closed o god will anoint the church
[1:26:23] then he who is filthy let him be filthy
[1:26:25] still who is righteous let him be
[1:26:27] righteous still he who is holy let him
[1:26:29] be holy still and god will anoint the
[1:26:32] church with the power of god and things
[1:26:34] will be taking place not only that then
[1:26:37] but he's doing it right now
[1:26:41] hallelujah we don't have to look off in
[1:26:43] the future when's god going to work
[1:26:45] god's moving right now
[1:26:47] the devil has come with a fang of
[1:26:50] bitterness and a fang of anxiety and a
[1:26:53] fang of fear and doubt and the fang of
[1:26:56] reasoning and he's coming along here and
[1:26:58] he's biting here and there and god's
[1:27:01] coming along as it was he already really
[1:27:04] came along but pardoned me and my mind
[1:27:06] is like going no it's all past tense
[1:27:08] paul
[1:27:09] excuse me i'm a little weird this
[1:27:11] morning
[1:27:14] maybe sister jerry put something in my
[1:27:15] coffee
[1:27:17] but look at this
[1:27:19] my brother and sister the people are
[1:27:21] still looking we're looking for a sign
[1:27:22] to follow william branham's ministry and
[1:27:25] i'm out here and you're out here saying
[1:27:27] praise the lord there it is brown look
[1:27:29] look look look what god's doing answered
[1:27:32] prayers the supernatural i'm standing
[1:27:35] here and telling you today god answers
[1:27:38] prayer constantly
[1:27:40] constantly saying i'm not looking off in
[1:27:42] some future time it's here it's now
[1:27:46] the serpent tried to kill it he's been
[1:27:48] biting it with all of his anti-message
[1:27:51] or whatever you want to call it oh i
[1:27:54] tell you what my brother and sister well
[1:27:56] there's people that are believing the
[1:27:57] sign and there are people that are
[1:27:59] believing the sign amen they'll believe
[1:28:02] whatever sign they look to whatever sign
[1:28:06] they have anointed themselves and
[1:28:08] prepared themselves for is the sign that
[1:28:11] they will receive at the biting of the
[1:28:14] serpent
[1:28:16] because none of us will sit here and say
[1:28:18] i've never had a doubt i've never had a
[1:28:19] fear
[1:28:20] i've never had an anxiety we can't say
[1:28:22] that no that's right we'd be lying if
[1:28:24] any one of us said oh i've just never
[1:28:27] but why did it kill your friend you grew
[1:28:29] up with
[1:28:30] and it didn't kill you
[1:28:32] why
[1:28:33] did great men in our midst
[1:28:36] fall away
[1:28:37] and not you amen
[1:28:42] say but you know i went through this and
[1:28:44] i don't know that i had the holy ghost
[1:28:46] well you know there was that man that
[1:28:47] picked up that track you know the story
[1:28:50] he went to this church that church this
[1:28:52] ministry that ministry he went
[1:28:53] everywhere finally ends up talking to
[1:28:55] brother branham and he's like i i need
[1:28:57] the holy ghost i want to find the holy
[1:28:58] ghost and brother branham is talking to
[1:29:00] him and he says oh you know so you found
[1:29:02] that track what happened he said i
[1:29:03] picked up that track and i read that and
[1:29:05] something
[1:29:06] happened inside of me
[1:29:11] imagine saints the prophet of god
[1:29:15] tells him
[1:29:16] that's
[1:29:17] when you receive the holy ghost when you
[1:29:20] cried out and said i have to have this
[1:29:28] but the bite of the serpent said now
[1:29:29] after you get done this and you do this
[1:29:31] and you do this and you serve faithfully
[1:29:33] here and give enough money to the church
[1:29:34] of course and do all these things and
[1:29:36] then you'll get the holy ghost
[1:29:38] no the prophet of god brings it down
[1:29:41] simplicity you imagine the rejoicing in
[1:29:43] that man's heart when he realized the
[1:29:45] hunger that drove him from coast to
[1:29:48] coast from ministry to ministry that
[1:29:51] hunger that was there god had already
[1:29:55] come and brought the answer
[1:29:57] oh hallelujah but satan tried to bite
[1:29:59] him tried to get him into the religious
[1:30:01] system tried to put the venom of
[1:30:04] religiosity into him and it left them
[1:30:07] there many of them cold that's right
[1:30:10] right that's exactly right can we go on
[1:30:12] for just a moment
[1:30:14] now let's look at the serpent in our day
[1:30:18] you thought i was preaching about our
[1:30:20] day but i really wasn't
[1:30:22] i just getting started
[1:30:24] look at this serpent of our day saints
[1:30:28] the prophet of god started voicing
[1:30:31] i was going to look it up i don't even
[1:30:32] know how many months but
[1:30:34] not that long before the lord took him
[1:30:36] off the scene the prophet of god started
[1:30:38] talking about i want to go back and i
[1:30:39] want to preach on the trail of the
[1:30:40] serpent
[1:30:44] why wouldn't that be nice if the lord
[1:30:46] would allow him to done that
[1:30:50] please pardon me
[1:30:51] i say this only facetiously
[1:30:55] second brother trevor i'm looking to see
[1:30:57] if under the tees if your name is on
[1:30:59] this list of the trail of the serpent
[1:31:05] oh
[1:31:06] sister kerry
[1:31:09] imagine what kind of a judgmental
[1:31:14] cannibalistic
[1:31:17] but god said i don't need to do that
[1:31:20] i don't need to do that because you see
[1:31:22] i'm going to fill my children so full of
[1:31:24] the holy ghost that the serpent of
[1:31:26] laodicea
[1:31:28] oh he might bite him come on if we were
[1:31:30] all courageous enough this morning we'd
[1:31:32] lift our hands and say there's times
[1:31:33] that we have been depressed we have been
[1:31:35] discouraged we have about given up on
[1:31:37] everything we have been hurt our hearts
[1:31:40] have just cried in despair
[1:31:43] and the devil want to come along and say
[1:31:45] see you all that happened because you're
[1:31:46] not really a son or daughter of god
[1:31:48] and if there was a list out there we'd
[1:31:50] be running over to the list and reading
[1:31:51] it and the devil would have
[1:31:53] in almost near perfect
[1:31:55] would have written our name
[1:31:57] in the
[1:31:58] sideline see your name's here
[1:32:00] god says you know what i'm not going to
[1:32:02] let you preach that because i'm going to
[1:32:04] let it manifest right don't go pulling
[1:32:06] the weed the weeds out of the wheat too
[1:32:08] early
[1:32:09] you'll kill some wheat
[1:32:12] let the holy ghost
[1:32:14] come right down in the end time here
[1:32:16] and it's going to start to separate
[1:32:18] these things
[1:32:20] and people are going to start to say now
[1:32:21] look the prophet of god said use young
[1:32:24] men these young men will come at the
[1:32:25] revelation of the message to carry it on
[1:32:28] i'm that young man
[1:32:30] follow me
[1:32:35] and some said
[1:32:36] we'll follow you
[1:32:39] but some said
[1:32:41] late
[1:32:45] lord my god said
[1:32:48] there'll be
[1:32:49] no
[1:32:50] other idols
[1:32:52] amen before me that's it right
[1:32:56] now look
[1:32:58] is this
[1:33:01] god of god
[1:33:05] or the serpent
[1:33:10] how's your filter doing
[1:33:13] you realize you've got to clean your
[1:33:14] filter every day
[1:33:16] you can't just get it all clogged up and
[1:33:18] let it go on bypass
[1:33:20] because then every little wiggle tail
[1:33:22] and whatever else goes up here can't go
[1:33:24] through the filter goes through the
[1:33:25] bypass
[1:33:27] and then people start believing all
[1:33:29] kinds
[1:33:30] of crazy things
[1:33:32] so if we'll take what the prophet told
[1:33:34] us i don't even need to go there do i we
[1:33:36] know what the prophet told us about
[1:33:37] pulling the filter out every day
[1:33:39] cleaning the filter read your bible
[1:33:41] and repent every single day
[1:33:44] wash the filter
[1:33:46] hallelujah i know this is just a real
[1:33:48] simple
[1:33:49] simple thought today my brother and
[1:33:51] sister
[1:33:52] but
[1:33:53] i'll tell you
[1:33:55] he wanted to preach the trail of the
[1:33:56] serpent because
[1:33:59] the serpent
[1:34:00] needed exposed
[1:34:02] can we say amen the serpent needed
[1:34:04] exposed but wait let's go back through
[1:34:07] the message
[1:34:09] let's go back through the message we're
[1:34:10] like we needed the prophet to preach
[1:34:13] this to expose the spirits of this day
[1:34:16] no come on go study the message pray
[1:34:18] over the message seek the mind of god
[1:34:21] read your bible and you'll find out
[1:34:22] those spirits have already been exposed
[1:34:25] the prophet of god didn't need to preach
[1:34:27] the trail of the serpent because the
[1:34:29] message of the hour and already exposed
[1:34:32] him
[1:34:33] he was already completely exposed
[1:34:36] amen but in man's reasoning in men's
[1:34:39] minds it was like you know what it's not
[1:34:42] talking about me brother david must be
[1:34:43] talking about you
[1:34:45] wasn't talking about our denomination
[1:34:47] must be talking about your denomination
[1:34:49] i'm telling you my brother and sister
[1:34:51] the holy ghost come and revealed every
[1:34:54] spirit contrary to the holy ghost in the
[1:34:57] hour we live in somebody bring some
[1:34:59] different idea of the message to you my
[1:35:02] brother and sister don't go swallowing
[1:35:04] that thing you know reminds me of a
[1:35:06] cartoon i've seen once if you don't mind
[1:35:07] be bringing a little humor and it shows
[1:35:09] these two fish
[1:35:11] and the ones holding the paper
[1:35:14] and here before them is a hook with this
[1:35:16] great big chunk of bait hanging on it
[1:35:18] and the one fish has already got his
[1:35:20] mouth open
[1:35:22] and the other one's like
[1:35:24] according to research
[1:35:26] that's evil
[1:35:35] what was it
[1:35:36] one was ready just swallow it
[1:35:39] another one says
[1:35:41] that's evil
[1:35:45] we don't know whether that one went
[1:35:46] ahead and swallowed it or not
[1:36:06] first corinthians 11 chapter
[1:36:11] here again
[1:36:14] would to god paul speaking to the
[1:36:16] corinthians he says would to god you
[1:36:17] could bear with me a little in my folly
[1:36:20] and indeed bear with me from jealous
[1:36:22] over you is it is it okay for a pastor
[1:36:25] to be jealous over his church
[1:36:28] he said i'm jealous over you with a
[1:36:30] godly jealousy for i've espoused you to
[1:36:33] one
[1:36:34] husband then i may present you as a
[1:36:37] chaste virgin to christ but i fear last
[1:36:40] by any hook with bait on it
[1:36:44] by any means as the serpent beguiled eve
[1:36:47] through his subtlety so your mind should
[1:36:49] be corrupted from the simplicity that is
[1:36:51] in christ for if he that cometh preaches
[1:36:54] another jesus
[1:36:56] whom we have not preached or you receive
[1:36:58] another spirit which we have not
[1:37:01] received or another gospel which you
[1:37:03] have not accepted you might well bear
[1:37:06] with him
[1:37:08] paul was concerned that when these
[1:37:10] things were introduced that people would
[1:37:12] not take it back to the word you say
[1:37:14] well praise the lord we take everything
[1:37:16] back to the word do we
[1:37:18] do we
[1:37:20] come on
[1:37:22] did you guys take my last sunday sermon
[1:37:25] and open up the message and say i want
[1:37:26] to see if paul's preaching the truth
[1:37:29] or did you just assume that you knew
[1:37:36] is that somebody's hide
[1:37:41] come on saints we need to be that
[1:37:42] serious about this
[1:37:45] oh but we know you brother paul we know
[1:37:46] you love us and we know you preach the
[1:37:47] truth do you
[1:37:49] do you
[1:37:54] well i would hope that you actually had
[1:37:56] confidence in me
[1:37:58] but you see so many through the
[1:38:00] scriptures blindly trusted
[1:38:02] the scripture records 400 into the
[1:38:04] wilderness all lost
[1:38:06] these out here lost
[1:38:09] these come to naught
[1:38:12] come on saints
[1:38:14] the serpent
[1:38:16] the serpent is so clever
[1:38:19] paul's telling him i'm jealous over you
[1:38:22] i want to present you as a chaste virgin
[1:38:24] i don't want you dancing with the devil
[1:38:27] and then putting on your clean clothes
[1:38:29] and coming to church
[1:38:34] that preaches another jesus or you
[1:38:36] receive another spirit or another gospel
[1:38:39] my brother and sister oh you're going to
[1:38:40] think i'm just can't let it go but
[1:38:43] there's people stood right here in this
[1:38:44] pulpit
[1:38:48] stood right here did you hear me
[1:38:51] people stood right here
[1:38:52] and spoke things that don't line up with
[1:38:54] scripture
[1:39:04] what is he injected in our day doubt
[1:39:05] fear bitterness disappointment it's
[1:39:07] killed some
[1:39:08] previously injured some you imagine now
[1:39:10] my brother and sister
[1:39:12] the devil brother trevor sorry you're on
[1:39:13] the front row sister nadia moved away
[1:39:16] amen
[1:39:20] i love you sister nadia
[1:39:24] but you see wait let me let me go about
[1:39:26] this a little different fashion
[1:39:37] say i lied to brother trevor we're
[1:39:39] talking about the capacity of a pastor
[1:39:41] i lied to brother trevor in other words
[1:39:43] it's a blatant outright
[1:39:45] misrepresentation
[1:39:48] and then i come back and i said brother
[1:39:50] trevor
[1:39:51] i really didn't mean to lie to you
[1:39:55] not one bit
[1:39:57] of sincerity just you know i didn't mean
[1:40:00] it
[1:40:01] i'm not going to look in the eye but i
[1:40:03] didn't mean it brother
[1:40:06] how long do you think it'll take brother
[1:40:08] trevor
[1:40:10] to ever trust me
[1:40:11] again
[1:40:17] almost impossible
[1:40:19] it is absolutely the grace of god amen
[1:40:24] so
[1:40:26] we come down and
[1:40:27] people say i'm not really bitter
[1:40:31] but i there's no way i'd trust this
[1:40:33] oh let's make it more personal
[1:40:38] no way i can trust my pastor
[1:40:41] might as well move on
[1:40:44] because even if the man has repented
[1:40:48] you'll never be able to trust him
[1:40:52] doubt put into the heart
[1:40:56] fear bitterness disappointment
[1:40:59] kill some
[1:41:01] but the devil wins just as well if it
[1:41:02] just grievously injures you
[1:41:05] if it leaves you
[1:41:07] where you don't trust
[1:41:09] what's being preached you don't trust
[1:41:10] the men who carried the word
[1:41:12] you see it's almost impossible
[1:41:14] but this bride and i i have my notes
[1:41:17] here word revealed amen she's not just a
[1:41:20] people out here this bride is the word
[1:41:22] revealed
[1:41:23] you realize saints it's not just us and
[1:41:25] we were so lucky that the message came
[1:41:27] to us no you are the word revealed in
[1:41:32] this hour you are the vessels that god
[1:41:36] the earth and vessel that god chose to
[1:41:39] pour his word into to be manifested in
[1:41:42] this day
[1:41:43] oh my brother and sister look at how it
[1:41:46] is
[1:41:46] and god just does it so this bride
[1:41:49] amen you know what's happening oh saints
[1:41:51] i hope you catch this you have been
[1:41:54] inoculated you've been anointed it
[1:41:57] doesn't mean that you're bite proof
[1:42:01] oh would somebody be brave enough to say
[1:42:03] i have been bit
[1:42:05] i have been bit
[1:42:07] the words the doubts the fears the
[1:42:10] bitternesses i have been bit but praise
[1:42:13] god he also anointed me with the holy
[1:42:17] ghost that i can shake off that unbelief
[1:42:20] and i'm not going to shake it off i'm
[1:42:22] going to throw it back into the pit of
[1:42:25] hell into the fire where it belonged
[1:42:28] hallelujah
[1:42:30] amen
[1:42:31] amen shake off satan's venom and still
[1:42:34] living i'll tell you what this bride
[1:42:36] because of eternal life being deposited
[1:42:39] in her will still be living
[1:42:44] when satan
[1:42:45] that little man
[1:42:47] is cast in the pit that's right
[1:42:50] oh take the symbology of paul
[1:42:52] taking that serpent
[1:42:54] who's come all the way through the ages
[1:42:57] and come right down and paul
[1:43:00] one of the greatest messengers god ever
[1:43:03] placed on the earth
[1:43:05] and he says i know where you belong
[1:43:07] serpent he didn't go throw him in the
[1:43:09] sea
[1:43:10] he didn't go throw him back out in the
[1:43:11] sticks out here
[1:43:13] oh look at the symbology saints he threw
[1:43:16] him in the fire
[1:43:19] oh hallelujah and then he didn't lament
[1:43:22] all these things about the serpent and
[1:43:24] the fact that the serpent bit him and
[1:43:26] all these things he went and got more
[1:43:28] wood and got his own personal fire that
[1:43:31] was for him as a son of god and threw
[1:43:34] more wood on it and warmed himself
[1:43:37] amen made himself ready to receive what
[1:43:40] god wanted and the mighty works and he
[1:43:42] goes on and turns these barbarians my
[1:43:45] brother and sister into believers
[1:43:47] he heals that one man's father from the
[1:43:50] bloody scours and he comes and the
[1:43:53] supernatural is there and these guys are
[1:43:55] like we'd heard there was a god
[1:43:58] but now we've seen amen oh look at this
[1:44:02] amen oh
[1:44:04] oh my i got to hurry
[1:44:06] john 10 24
[1:44:09] amen look at this just real quick
[1:44:11] so you see they said unto him how long
[1:44:13] does this make us to doubt if that'll be
[1:44:14] the christ tell us plainly jesus
[1:44:16] answered them i told you you believe not
[1:44:18] the works that i do in my father's name
[1:44:19] they bear witness of me but you believe
[1:44:21] not because you're not my sheep as i
[1:44:24] said unto you my sheep hear my voice and
[1:44:26] i know them and they follow me and i
[1:44:28] give unto them eternal life and they
[1:44:31] shall never
[1:44:32] perish amen
[1:44:35] look at this i want to put it to you
[1:44:37] this way right here
[1:44:38] you'll still be living
[1:44:41] when the serpent
[1:44:42] is cast
[1:44:43] into the pit
[1:44:45] oh praise the lord
[1:44:48] amen and i give unto them eternal life
[1:44:51] and they shall never perish neither
[1:44:53] shall any man pluck them out of my hand
[1:44:56] what a confidence my brother and sister
[1:44:59] amen you say well
[1:45:01] brother paul there's times i just feel
[1:45:03] like that i couldn't even be a sheep
[1:45:06] praise the lord
[1:45:08] praise the lord
[1:45:09] i'm actually you know what you're going
[1:45:10] to think i'm weird i'm happy that you
[1:45:12] don't think you could be a sheep
[1:45:14] because the worst thing
[1:45:16] to kill a christian
[1:45:18] is a narcissistic
[1:45:20] view of the word of god
[1:45:23] it's all about me
[1:45:24] it's all about me god did everything for
[1:45:26] me
[1:45:27] well the believers over there saying the
[1:45:28] same words but behind that
[1:45:32] is
[1:45:33] saying lord
[1:45:34] without you i am nothing
[1:45:37] without your holy spirit i'd be gone in
[1:45:39] a day
[1:45:40] i would be just crushed by this little
[1:45:42] man we call satan
[1:45:44] but because he can give the image
[1:45:46] i would defeat
[1:45:48] catch us
[1:45:49] i would defeat myself
[1:45:53] do you realize satan will never defeat
[1:45:55] one single individual
[1:46:00] amen
[1:46:01] you've got to walk over the whole word
[1:46:02] of god to get to hell that's exactly
[1:46:05] right that's exactly right you
[1:46:07] allowed the devil to anoint you
[1:46:10] to defeat
[1:46:11] yourself
[1:46:12] amen amen that's right yeah that's why
[1:46:15] the devil's outside the church crying
[1:46:16] right now because he gets blamed for
[1:46:18] everything
[1:46:20] yeah
[1:46:21] my father which gave them me is greater
[1:46:23] than all and no man is able to pluck
[1:46:25] them out of my father's hands and i and
[1:46:27] my father are one
[1:46:28] i i threw that i put on here optional
[1:46:31] for time but i read it anyway so i hope
[1:46:33] you don't mind
[1:46:34] amen now let's hurry along here i don't
[1:46:36] keep you too long
[1:46:38] now in christ the mystery of god
[1:46:39] revealed have any of you listened to
[1:46:41] this recently
[1:46:42] yeah i'm telling you if you haven't
[1:46:44] please go listen to it it is so power
[1:46:47] packed
[1:46:48] you know you see advertisements i don't
[1:46:50] remember i was in a store the other day
[1:46:52] they had a tv up on a display for sale
[1:46:55] and and just as i was walking as it were
[1:46:58] towards it you know they have some i
[1:47:00] don't know what what it was you guys
[1:47:02] some of you drink them the one you know
[1:47:04] that drink that's got the devil's
[1:47:05] pitchfork on it
[1:47:08] oh monster yeah that's right
[1:47:10] i when i see it i just see it's like oh
[1:47:12] there's there's the devil's pitch for it
[1:47:16] oh sorry i said that out loud
[1:47:20] maybe it'll cause some of you to give up
[1:47:22] your
[1:47:24] caffeine and sugar
[1:47:27] and if you don't i still love you
[1:47:30] as though that would matter
[1:47:34] so it's christ expressing himself in the
[1:47:36] individual that's right whether he's
[1:47:38] intellectual or whether he's doesn't
[1:47:40] know his abcs don't you like it god
[1:47:42] covered all bases right there amen some
[1:47:45] of you are over here intellectual
[1:47:47] and me and a few are over here on the
[1:47:49] other side don't know our abcs
[1:47:52] he don't know his abcs half the apostles
[1:47:54] didn't know it that's right but they
[1:47:57] knowed christ that's right they'd never
[1:47:59] taken
[1:48:00] heed to peter and john knowing that they
[1:48:02] had been out of some seminary they said
[1:48:05] they'd taken heed and noticed that they
[1:48:07] had been with christ and when they
[1:48:09] healed the lame man see at the gate they
[1:48:11] know that they had been with christ the
[1:48:14] new birth amen it's
[1:48:16] christ it amen that's right you say but
[1:48:18] i i'm always wondering do i really have
[1:48:21] the new birth do i have the holy ghost
[1:48:24] get into christ
[1:48:26] yes sir don't hold it out here is some
[1:48:28] magical thing that we're gonna we're
[1:48:29] gonna you know try and achieve or do
[1:48:32] it's christ
[1:48:34] it's that simple this is the whole
[1:48:35] mystery
[1:48:37] this is why it's stunning when people
[1:48:39] would say the seventh seal is not open
[1:48:41] when the prophet of god showed us
[1:48:42] clearly that the seventh seal was the
[1:48:44] whole plan of redemption
[1:48:47] so no you ain't got redemption
[1:48:49] what are we doing here then if we don't
[1:48:51] have redemption
[1:48:52] why is there a desire a craving a fire
[1:48:55] burning in our souls to
[1:48:57] just
[1:48:58] have and hope the lord right amen just
[1:49:01] as a marriage vow to have and to hold
[1:49:04] and to cherish why is it we feel that
[1:49:06] way if redemption shut off
[1:49:09] why because it's turned salvation into a
[1:49:12] cold religious clinical event that's
[1:49:15] exactly right
[1:49:20] the new birth is christ amen now the
[1:49:22] very next section of this see
[1:49:25] i love it
[1:49:26] because there'll be many a person
[1:49:28] i can name some names if i felt inclined
[1:49:31] that don't believe they have the holy
[1:49:32] ghost and they come to church and they
[1:49:34] cry out and they cry out and they cry
[1:49:36] out for the holy ghost don't they don't
[1:49:38] realize
[1:49:40] that's christ in them that's right
[1:49:43] that's christ in them
[1:49:44] that's the desire of their heart
[1:49:47] but because maybe somebody's taught them
[1:49:49] that they had to have a sensation
[1:49:51] they had to have a a little something
[1:50:04] i'm lost
[1:50:06] oh right there okay thank
[1:50:08] you new birth is christ is a revelation
[1:50:11] god has revealed to you this great
[1:50:14] mystery and that's a new birth
[1:50:16] now what are you going to do when you
[1:50:18] get all that group together where the
[1:50:20] revelation is perfectly in harmony and
[1:50:24] god expressing it it through his word by
[1:50:27] the same actions the same things that he
[1:50:29] did making the word manifest oh if the
[1:50:32] church only knew its position
[1:50:36] it will one day
[1:50:38] hallelujah i'm going to make a statement
[1:50:41] please just accept it as a simple
[1:50:43] statement
[1:50:44] many of you struggle because you don't
[1:50:47] know your position
[1:50:50] the devil's got you over here in the
[1:50:52] weak and beggarly
[1:50:54] and god is wanting you to recognize that
[1:50:57] it never was you it can't be you because
[1:51:01] you can't do it because the bite of the
[1:51:04] serpent is stronger than your flesh
[1:51:08] but when you get in christ amen the
[1:51:10] serpent can bite you with doubts and
[1:51:13] fears and weaknesses and afflictions in
[1:51:15] the flesh and we can say praise the lord
[1:51:18] it doesn't matter anyhow i've come too
[1:51:21] far to quit now
[1:51:23] amen i'm gonna go i don't care what the
[1:51:26] flesh has and what the spirit says
[1:51:28] boohoo about i'm gonna keep moving in
[1:51:31] the word
[1:51:32] oh if the church only knew its position
[1:51:35] it will one day then the rapture will go
[1:51:38] when it knows what it is
[1:51:40] oh i'm saying lord help us
[1:51:43] help us lord the devil is trying to bite
[1:51:45] us to keep us distracted trying to keep
[1:51:48] us saying whoa unto me if i can just
[1:51:51] overcome this thing in my flesh if i can
[1:51:53] just overcome this thing in my mind if i
[1:51:56] can overcome this emotion or this
[1:51:58] circumstance then i can press forward i
[1:52:01] want to tell you you've already overcome
[1:52:04] it you have been battered but you are
[1:52:07] victorious
[1:52:09] you have to reach out and take
[1:52:11] possession of your victory
[1:52:13] oh and when you take possession of your
[1:52:16] victory the devil's going to recognize
[1:52:18] people say well i i had a terrible sadie
[1:52:21] saturday
[1:52:22] well so did i
[1:52:24] my friday wasn't too good either neither
[1:52:26] was mine
[1:52:28] but i tell you what i did
[1:52:30] i got up saturday morning
[1:52:33] fix the things i should have fixed
[1:52:34] friday night
[1:52:37] and moved on
[1:52:40] because you see
[1:52:41] ain't no devil gonna hold me down
[1:52:45] hold me down
[1:52:47] hold me down
[1:52:48] ain't no devil gonna hold me down cause
[1:52:51] on my way to heaven amen
[1:52:55] hallelujah it's best sung when you got
[1:52:57] chairs you can climb up on top of
[1:52:59] but i'm telling you my brother and
[1:53:00] sister that's the truth of it but if
[1:53:02] you'd spend days weeks months and year
[1:53:04] looking back on your mistake
[1:53:07] the devil's like well he's weak enough
[1:53:09] i'll bite him again amen
[1:53:11] praise the lord look at that he put down
[1:53:13] his sword you know the one thing
[1:53:14] serpents don't like is swords
[1:53:16] and when you put down your sword the
[1:53:18] serpent says look i've got an
[1:53:19] opportunity bite him again
[1:53:22] and i'll bite him again
[1:53:24] and then i bit their best friend
[1:53:26] and i'll get them to help me bite them
[1:53:30] oh i just called you up because i care
[1:53:31] about you
[1:53:33] i love you so much
[1:53:35] you know you're in a cult
[1:53:38] and you know it everything's going to
[1:53:39] fall apart and they're going to prove
[1:53:40] one day that none of it was the word of
[1:53:42] god
[1:53:44] you need to come
[1:53:46] hang out with me no
[1:53:48] no i
[1:53:49] haven't found a church i can stand yet
[1:53:53] yeah they're all so watered down they're
[1:53:54] all so weak they're all so wimperly
[1:53:58] but praise the lord the message is the
[1:53:59] truth
[1:54:01] i have the truth
[1:54:08] and people are like
[1:54:10] my friend was always so much smarter
[1:54:11] than me
[1:54:13] they must be right
[1:54:15] because i failed here and i failed there
[1:54:18] i made this mistake and i
[1:54:23] sunday morning i didn't even
[1:54:25] didn't want to go to church
[1:54:29] my wife forced me to
[1:54:31] ask her why should i go
[1:54:33] she said because you're the preacher
[1:54:40] but when you get that group in harmony
[1:54:44] where revelation
[1:54:46] revelation
[1:54:47] lines up
[1:54:49] every where
[1:54:50] you turn
[1:54:52] i don't have to
[1:54:54] scrub out this or overlook this
[1:54:57] revelation comes together that
[1:54:59] revelation you know i want to i don't
[1:55:02] want to really try and change the
[1:55:03] prophet's words here but if you just
[1:55:04] give me liberty god expressing it
[1:55:07] through his word by the same actions
[1:55:09] right so what is it the same action is
[1:55:13] where the revelation is perfectly in
[1:55:15] harmony so the revelation being in
[1:55:18] harmony is one of the actions
[1:55:22] because if the revelation oh i've got a
[1:55:24] new revelation i was going to share that
[1:55:26] with you church i have a new revelation
[1:55:31] you'd be surprised how many people would
[1:55:32] say wow praise god
[1:55:36] some of you had already bolted the doors
[1:55:38] knocked off the hinges laying out in the
[1:55:39] parking lot because you're gone
[1:55:43] can i share my new revelation
[1:55:46] my new revelation is really an old
[1:55:47] revelation
[1:55:49] but it was new this morning about 3 a.m
[1:55:54] my revelation is i need more of jesus
[1:55:57] i need more of jesus god's speaking to
[1:56:00] me at 3 a.m fall
[1:56:02] you need more buddy amen don't stop
[1:56:05] where you're at keep going keep going
[1:56:08] hallelujah keep going what will happen
[1:56:11] when paul knows where he belongs
[1:56:14] when paul knows his position paul's
[1:56:17] going in a rapture can somebody agree
[1:56:19] with me
[1:56:20] amen hallelujah hallelujah
[1:56:24] look at this now sister emmy
[1:56:26] brother sean would you come
[1:56:38] i hope you can understand what i'm going
[1:56:40] to say here
[1:56:49] they know they'd been with christ
[1:56:52] they had the same actions the same
[1:56:54] things that he did making the word
[1:56:56] manifest that's right
[1:56:58] look at this now my brother and sister
[1:57:05] you say brother branham
[1:57:06] that that ain't oh yes it is too it's
[1:57:09] the truth did you notice
[1:57:11] paul never knew jesus physically amen
[1:57:16] paul never knew him
[1:57:18] the only way that paul knew him
[1:57:20] was by revelation
[1:57:23] by a vision is that right
[1:57:26] paul only knew
[1:57:27] jesus by the revelation amen
[1:57:31] just
[1:57:32] like
[1:57:33] peter did
[1:57:36] now i want to just place something in
[1:57:37] your heart before we're done today
[1:57:41] here's paul
[1:57:44] some say notably the
[1:57:46] most prolific
[1:57:48] and revelated of all
[1:57:51] of those men
[1:57:53] we're not here to argue each one
[1:57:55] fulfilled their position that's right
[1:57:56] that's exactly right
[1:57:58] peter
[1:58:00] knew christ
[1:58:01] stumble
[1:58:03] thank you peter thank you peter
[1:58:07] comes back to the word
[1:58:09] already been given the promise of the
[1:58:10] word that i'm going to build my church
[1:58:12] on you peter
[1:58:14] right
[1:58:16] some of you get all nervous on it but
[1:58:18] what i just said was true yeah it is
[1:58:22] yeah
[1:58:23] peter
[1:58:25] the revelated
[1:58:26] man of god
[1:58:28] the word was built on him
[1:58:30] peter
[1:58:31] brought the word
[1:58:33] laid the foundation of it
[1:58:35] and the church looked back to peter
[1:58:38] but not peter the man
[1:58:40] peter the word
[1:58:42] [Music]
[1:58:44] are you with me
[1:58:45] peter the
[1:58:46] word amen
[1:58:49] come on are you all with me
[1:58:52] [Music]
[1:58:54] peter the word
[1:58:56] now here's paul theologically trained
[1:58:59] never sees jesus
[1:59:01] but he knows theology of what the
[1:59:03] message says
[1:59:04] [Music]
[1:59:06] has an experience supernatural
[1:59:08] experience
[1:59:10] goes to a back side of the desert
[1:59:14] and out in the backside of the desert
[1:59:16] god starts dealing with him
[1:59:19] starts cutting away
[1:59:21] all these little ideas and ideologies
[1:59:23] and all the traditions of men
[1:59:26] cunning them away
[1:59:30] must have been nice for paul to be able
[1:59:32] to go on an oasis in the backside of the
[1:59:34] desert was it
[1:59:35] just as nice as it is when the holy
[1:59:37] spirit comes to you
[1:59:38] and starts cutting away amen
[1:59:44] but by revelation
[1:59:46] by revelation paul is able to come back
[1:59:50] and him and peter
[1:59:52] are preaching the same gospel
[1:59:54] [Music]
[1:59:57] come on we know we know it wasn't peter
[1:59:59] saints
[2:00:01] amen to those who think brother david
[2:00:02] and i was disagreeing it's just which
[2:00:04] avenue you come to this because when we
[2:00:06] look at peter the man it could never
[2:00:09] have been peter the man no more than it
[2:00:11] could be you the man or woman
[2:00:15] but it was a revelation of almighty god
[2:00:18] poured into peter and what did that do
[2:00:22] it displaced everything that was peter
[2:00:26] [Music]
[2:00:27] come on
[2:00:28] who's no longer you say why was peter
[2:00:30] they're preaching no it wasn't
[2:00:32] peter was the shell
[2:00:34] the earth and vessel
[2:00:37] peter only was the earth and vassal that
[2:00:40] the word i've got a quote at home i
[2:00:42] should have included it but i thought
[2:00:43] i'm going to be done by noon
[2:00:46] but look at this now
[2:00:48] paul comes starts preaching the word
[2:00:50] writes all of these books goes to all of
[2:00:53] these places lays all this foundation
[2:00:56] gives his life for that
[2:00:58] now fast forward in time prophet of god
[2:01:00] is discouraged
[2:01:02] go study it you'll find that when the
[2:01:04] prophet of god went beyond the curtain
[2:01:07] of time god was actually
[2:01:11] doing a move he might say to take away
[2:01:13] the discouragement from brother brian
[2:01:15] [Music]
[2:01:18] and he says would you like to see the
[2:01:19] other side and he said oh lord that
[2:01:21] would be so good
[2:01:23] [Music]
[2:01:25] translation
[2:01:27] people that don't like the message are
[2:01:29] like god don't do things like that
[2:01:31] really
[2:01:34] they don't read their bibles
[2:01:36] god does things like that
[2:01:41] brother brown is now standing there in
[2:01:42] the midst of the saints right we'll go
[2:01:44] into the whole thing here just very
[2:01:45] briefly though they're running
[2:01:47] these young beautiful women running
[2:01:50] hugging the prophet
[2:01:52] [Music]
[2:01:53] well that's contrary to what we believe
[2:01:56] that you see in that other element
[2:01:58] we have now left the flesh man
[2:02:01] behind
[2:02:03] [Music]
[2:02:07] holy spirit speaks to him and says oh
[2:02:10] you didn't recognize her no she was 91 i
[2:02:12] believe it was when you led her to the
[2:02:13] lord
[2:02:15] [Music]
[2:02:16] wow
[2:02:18] the prophet gives these words as it is
[2:02:20] when when you might say the interview is
[2:02:21] closing out
[2:02:23] it says i preached
[2:02:26] what paul preached
[2:02:28] [Music]
[2:02:31] and they said
[2:02:33] we're counting or we're standing
[2:02:35] on that
[2:02:38] praise the lord i'm gonna throw a
[2:02:40] fastball at you can i give you all
[2:02:42] something to fret over
[2:02:46] [Music]
[2:02:48] when the prophet of god said
[2:02:51] [Music]
[2:02:53] that i preached
[2:02:55] paul's gospel
[2:02:58] was he talking doctrine
[2:03:02] [Music]
[2:03:08] remember
[2:03:10] doctrine won't give you revelation
[2:03:13] but revelation
[2:03:15] will give you doctrine amen
[2:03:18] i just put this in your minds i'm not
[2:03:20] preaching doctrine
[2:03:23] i believe it could almost be called
[2:03:24] revelation
[2:03:26] brother branham standing there says i
[2:03:29] preached what paul preached
[2:03:31] i preached on water baptism i preached
[2:03:33] on this and i preached on this and i
[2:03:35] preached on this and i got this right
[2:03:36] and i got that right
[2:03:38] or was the prophet of god now you're
[2:03:40] going to say paul you're starting to
[2:03:41] interpret it i don't mean it that way
[2:03:43] or was the prophet of god saying
[2:03:45] [Music]
[2:03:46] i preached revelation
[2:03:49] i preached revelation
[2:03:51] and they already had caught
[2:03:54] the revelation
[2:03:56] and they could say
[2:03:58] we're counting we're standing on that
[2:04:01] because this revelation of jesus christ
[2:04:05] you notice there's way more
[2:04:07] way less i should say be the right words
[2:04:10] emphasis placed in scripture
[2:04:13] and doctrine
[2:04:15] than there is on
[2:04:17] being in the spirit having the holy
[2:04:19] ghost and having the revelation of jesus
[2:04:22] christ he doesn't say you know when
[2:04:24] seventh angel comes that he's going to
[2:04:27] fulfill all the doctrines
[2:04:31] look at that i i'm just wanting to stir
[2:04:33] up your prayer minds
[2:04:34] what was it
[2:04:36] revelation
[2:04:38] see we can have every doctrine right
[2:04:41] imagine our young people able so coached
[2:04:44] to be able to teach us
[2:04:47] elders
[2:04:48] serpency
[2:04:50] and baptism
[2:04:52] and godhead
[2:04:55] but no revelation who jesus christ is in
[2:04:57] their life
[2:04:58] [Music]
[2:05:02] oh
[2:05:03] saints
[2:05:06] we may be a little battered
[2:05:10] but we're victorious
[2:05:13] because the word said that he would
[2:05:14] reveal himself in this last hour
[2:05:17] and i for one believe he has
[2:05:21] i believe it's a finished word
[2:05:23] hallelujah hallelujah
[2:05:26] oh
[2:05:27] brother jason will you come help me
[2:05:28] let's stand saints you know i

[2:05:34] forgive me and i'm not apologizing i'm
[2:05:36] trying to get over that complex too
[2:05:38] but i literally left so many thoughts on
[2:05:42] the desk because i was like yeah i
[2:05:43] better not preach any more than this
[2:05:46] my if i had given you the full meal deal
[2:05:51] you know i heard i heard this the other
[2:05:52] day it was so funny
[2:05:54] he says
[2:05:55] you have to wonder about someone
[2:05:58] who pays all the money to go to a
[2:06:00] buffet and only gets one little plate
[2:06:05] there is something
[2:06:07] wrong

[2:06:35] and she says tell me what was it that

[2:06:53] you ate a lot
[2:06:54] of nothing
[2:06:57] [Music]
[2:06:59] and his only response in his defense he
[2:07:02] says

[2:07:06] but since we've come
[2:07:08] we've got
[2:07:09] a buffet a banquet table
[2:07:12] amen we've got everything that god
[2:07:14] desired not only does it taste good

[2:07:19] i think it
[2:07:21] you know what's tearing me down is this
[2:07:22] work
[2:07:24] the curse in the garden

[2:07:27] tearing me down because i tell you what

[2:08:31] amen he's trying to bring us into the
[2:08:34] 21st century's what his problem is
[2:08:37] amen let's just worship the lord for a
[2:08:38] few minutes before we leave
[2:08:40] surely
[2:08:42] the presence of the lord
[2:08:45] is in this place
[2:08:48] hallelujah no longer we're losing our
[2:08:51] connection to laodicea
[2:08:53] amen
[2:08:54] yeah you realize that
[2:08:56] oh so let me just
[2:09:00] i won't name any names but
[2:09:02] the celebrity chat lines
[2:09:04] ditched some hollywood guy
[2:09:07] because the words he said the other day
[2:09:10] they're increasingly suspicious
[2:09:14] that he might have become a christian
[2:09:18] first off you want to know why i was on
[2:09:20] a celebrity chat line
[2:09:24] it was a headline
[2:09:26] on another deal of another deal that i
[2:09:28] looked at
[2:09:30] but i'm trying to make a point to you
[2:09:32] [Music]
[2:09:33] look what they're talking about
[2:09:36] this whole hollywood celebrity
[2:09:38] might not be usable in hollywood any
[2:09:40] longer
[2:09:42] because he said something about
[2:09:45] jesus christ is lord and savior
[2:09:48] and that
[2:09:49] is unacceptable
[2:09:51] [Music]
[2:09:54] it's another day closer saints
[2:09:57] hallelujah hallelujah one more day
[2:09:59] closer they're denied him sister jerry
[2:10:02] and i look and pardon me just sister
[2:10:04] jerry and i was looking at a deal and
[2:10:06] these people are lamenting what is
[2:10:08] happening to our children what is
[2:10:09] happening to our education what is
[2:10:11] happening to our government and sister
[2:10:13] jerry is this coming along goes 1956
[2:10:15] that's what happened
[2:10:17] 1956 they could have accepted christ
[2:10:20] they chose to reject him
[2:10:22] amen another sign we're that much closer
[2:10:26] hallelujah
[2:10:28] surely
[2:10:31] the presence
[2:10:33] of the
[2:10:35] lord is in this place
[2:10:39] i can feel
[2:10:42] his mighty power
[2:10:45] and his grace
[2:10:50] i can't hear the brush of angel's wings
[2:10:56] i see
[2:10:57] glory on each face
[2:11:01] [Music]
[2:11:03] surely
[2:11:04] the presence
[2:11:07] of the
[2:11:08] lord is in this place
[2:11:12] do you know my brother and sister
[2:11:15] i'm sorry i just
[2:11:18] for some of us here today this might be
[2:11:21] 1956.
[2:11:22] [Music]
[2:11:25] come a time that
[2:11:27] we can quote the message
[2:11:29] do all of these things
[2:11:32] but have we fully embraced it
[2:11:34] now remember the message is jesus christ
[2:11:40] [Music]
