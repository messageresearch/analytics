Yes. Let's pray for Sister Dorcas. Remember, for a complete healing and those who are traveling, the Grahams family, um the whites, um and who else was it? Yeah. Well, just pray for these needs and then we'll have brother Isaac come up and share something with us. Uh brother David, would you mind leading us in a word of prayer this morning? &gt;&gt; Thank you. God bless you. Let's bow our heads in prayer. Lord, we bow our heads before thee, the king of who has never failed to be where two or three are gathered together. There am I in their midst. Lord, we are so thankful for the word that's made power in us. But that's the power you said would be in your bride. The power to manifest your word, the power to express life, to give life, to impart life. Lord, that's the reason we're here to manifest your word and for this hour and this season, this great event that is upon us, Lord, and taking place to bring us to a body change. We lift up these that are in need, Lord. Our brother and sister White traveling and sister April, Lord, and her need and where she is. And Lord, be with them and be others that are traveling, others, Lord, not well, be in their midst. So God, we know that you're present. We know that you're here to reveal and open your word to those that have an ear to hear what the spirit is saying in this hour. We're expecting it, Lord. And we give you praise now for answering these requests and all others, even unspoken requests in our midst. May you fulfill your purpose and perfect will in our lives. And let us line up with the word and lay our veil upon your shoulders, trusting, relying upon you. For you said that you would keep those in perfect peace whose mind is stayed upon thee because we trust thee. Now we give you thanks for answering prayer. In Jesus Christ's name we pray and say thank you Lord. We give you thanks. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. You may be seated with Isaac. Make your way up here. Um and then we'll have a special posture if you want to come up after this. God bless you this morning, man. Thanks for your prayers. We had a had a nasty snowstorm on the way home yesterday, but we wanted to make it back. So, we plowed on. I don't get that nervous driving, but I was a little nervous driving yesterday. But, uh, God is gracious. Amen. Um, just wanted to give a report. We um gave some money to a brother uh down in uh he's from I have El Salvador stuck in my head, but it's Nicaragua. Brother Ezekiel. Um he had been invited to some meetings they were having. So he's he's traveled I think since we we talked to him. Um so he's he's has translated for my dad several times. Um and he's he's a minister as well um um for the for the local assembly there that he attends there in Nicaragua. And um he had been invited to some meetings to preach some meetings in El Salvador and uh and Costa Rica if I remember right and um was unable didn't have the money to make it. Um the tickets there can be kind of spendy for the but he always likes to travel with his wife as well. we kind of heard about this and um I reached out to him and brother Paul and um contacted him to find out what uh what what the need was and we uh were able to send him some money. There's got a picture of him and his wife. Probably rotate that them on the plane. If you turn your head sideways, you can see it right. I I had a couple more on my phone, but I didn't get them all sent in time. I kind of did it at the last minute there. Um but he was able to preach um those meetings and and travel to several other little uh groups there throughout El Salvador and uh in Costa Rica there. There's some of the the uh some of one of one of the churches he was able to visit, but he reported back and said they they had a wonderful time. Um and just wanted to share that that we were able to support him in doing that and in going out and preaching the gospel. Amen. And I think that's very important, you know, and uh you know, desire in my heart is that souls would be saved. Amen. Uh I think that's the only two I got on there. I had got the other two in the email. If you want to see them, I got them on my phone, but uh you know, they sent them to me in WhatsApp and I didn't uh I didn't get get to it till till this morning, the last minute. So, God bless you.

Not by might, nor by power, but by my spirit, saith the Lord. This mountain shall be removed. This mountain shall be removed. This mountain shall be removed by my spirit, saith the Lord.

This mountain shall be removed by my spirit, saith the Lord. Amen. Praise the Lord. Um sing one more song and um we have a dedication this morning. Praise the Lord. Brother Brashant, sister Kcha, if you want to make your way forward as we sing, bring them in. Let's go up to the key of G. Bring them in. Bring them in. Bring them in from the fields of sin. Bring them in. Bring them in. Bring the wandering ones to Jesus. Bring them in. Bring them in. Bring them to us. Jesus said, "Bring them in. Bring them in. Bring the little ones to Jesus." &gt;&gt; Amen. And what a wonderful privilege that we have today to be here to um dedicate such a wonderful, wonderful little boy. Um I've just had a wonderful time there at the house just uh getting to play with him. I've even got down on the floor and rolled around on the floor with him a little bit. And uh so today we want to dedicate little Isaac William. And Isaac and this so fits this young man. Isaac means he will laugh or one who laughs and rejoices. Amen. And that fits this little guy perfectly. William is a resolute or determined protector, strong willed warrior. We'll pray for you on that part. Amen. But uh anyway, just such a a real privilege uh brother Pashant, sister Koncha, um the miles may separate us, but our hearts are knit uh as one with you. And um we thank the Lord for the fellowship, the friendship, um to share prayers and these wonderful milestones. How many days that you have prayed for a baby and here we are. My how precious. And just just makes my heart melt to see this wonderful little guy. Amen. You think he'll let me hold him? I think he will. Say hi to everyone. You know, Brother Brandham did that once. He took the baby and made him wave to everybody. Okay, let's dedicate him. Heavenly Father, Lord, as we stand before you this morning, we're holding this love gift, a blessing, Father, that you poured right out of heaven into the life of my brother Persant and sister Konsha. And Father, this little guy, Isaac William, Lord, we're just asking you, Father, just to seal him. Lord, we know that the days that would come might be dark and harrowing, Father. But Lord, with your hand upon his life, Father, he can live all the days. As King David said, that I may dwell in the house of the Lord forever. We're asking, Lord, for your hand of mercy, protection, leadership upon Isaac, Father. Lord, as you would just bring him, Father, however long, Lord, that you Terry, may he just be, Father, there as a young man growing up in the house of God. I think of that. I think of Samuel, Lord, how he was committed, Father, and was there in the house of God. And may you just touch little Isaac's life, Father, and let him be committed to you, Lord. Bless him. Give him strength. Give him health, Father. Lord, give him wisdom. Lord, we thank you for this for the family. Father, brother Persant, Sister Aona. Lord, that they would have wisdom to to raise him, Lord, to nurture him in the things of your word, Lord, that he would know, Father, what it was to dwell in your presence. We ask these blessings now in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen. Amen. Isn't he handsome little guy? Yes. Yeah. Smile. Not now. The reason I do that is cuz at the house I many times I'm like, "Okay, now smile." And it's like almost on command, you know? Just smile. And he smiles. Oh, God bless you. Amen. Yeah. Sister God. God bless you. Amen. Don't want anybody to think that we that we were captivating their time, but it certainly has been a blessing to have brother Pashant and sister Koncha in the house with us. Amen. So, I just want to make a couple announcements here. So, this coming Wednesday will be New Year's Eve and um I want us to just go ahead and have a service and uh what we'll focus on will be songs, worship, some testimony. Um if you have special songs, we would sure appreciate that. Uh some testimonies maybe to share what the Lord has done for you. Uh and uh I don't believe any one of us here today would be able to say the Lord hasn't done something significant in our life. Amen. Salvation is probably the not probably is the milestone of every individual's life being filled with the Holy Ghost. Amen. There we come into a milestone of what God is doing for us. And so um if you just Wednesday night just uh same time 7:30 and then we will have light meal finger food or something in the basement uh just afterwards a little time of fellowship and uh so we look forward to that. I believe it'll be a wonderful time. Uh, brother Jose Hernandez will be speaking for us next weekend and um I had invited him um oh back quite a few weeks ago and uh this is a time that works for him and uh I believe it will work for us just fine. Amen. So we've talked about the missions, we've talked about those that are away on holiday. remember our sister Rachel in prayer. Just uh it is imminent to have another uh beautiful baby here in the church. Amen. Just so looking forward to that. Uh and u may the Lord just protect uh mom and baby and uh look forward to uh having them in our midst. Amen. Is it good to be in the house of the Lord today? &gt;&gt; Amen. I want to speak to you once again. Thank you so much our musicians. And I want to speak to you this morning on the title of a junction of time part two. Um if you if you get a chance, it's a it's a lovely sermon that brother Brham taught uh preached there for us. It is uh just incredibly uh inspiring to me uh because he comes down and he brings all these events that took place in scripture through the years and he shows us how those were a junction in time. And so when we're looking at each one of these, we we'll see that Noah uh there was a junction in time, a coming together, God proving his word. He's proving he's not a god of history. He's a god very present. Amen. So, we don't want to look at him as though he's a historical god even though he was there in history. But he is here today. Amen. And so, I just uh been uh studying that and u uh also on the attraction. What is the attraction on the mountain? Uh just been stirring my heart. Let's turn in our Bibles if we would to First Peter the 2 chapter verses 1-10. Amen. I enjoyed that special. Um that was that was good. Thank you. Amen. First Peter 2 chapter verses 1-10. Now, we could take as a side note that what our real goal here is to make a rapture, right? We're we're not here to to put on some cloak of righteousness like a Pharisee or Sadducee. Uh we don't put on stripes as it were on the sleeve as it would be in the military to show how long you've been in the service. None of that matters. What matters is that when he calls, we're ready. Amen. That's what matters. Amen. And so, I just love this scripture. Wherefore, laying aside all malice and all guile and hypocrisies and envys and all evil speakings, as newborn babes, desire the sincere milk of the word, that ye may grow thereby. If so be ye have tasted that the Lord is gracious to whom coming as unto a living stone, disallowed indeed of men, but chosen of God and precious. Ye also as lively stones are built up a spiritual house, a holy priesthood to offer up spiritual sacrifices acceptable to God by Jesus Christ. Wherefore also it is contained in the scripture, behold, I lay in sign a chief cornerstone, elect, precious, and he that believeth on him shall not be confounded. Unto you therefore, which believe, he is precious. Can we say amen to that? Amen. But unto them which be disobedient, the stone which the builders disallowed, the same is made the head of the corner, and a stone of stumbling, and a rock of offense, even to them which stumble at the word, being disobedient, where unto also they were appointed. Now verse eight is very stunning, my brother and sister, for us. We we really should embrace and understand what we were appointed to. Yes. &gt;&gt; Amen. The scripture so clearly says that that uh they were a stone, a stumbling rock of offense to them that stumble at the word, being disobedient. They were appointed to that. &gt;&gt; But we weren't appointed to that. We were appointed to be believers of the word of God. &gt;&gt; Amen. And we can never overstate that too much. Amen. It it we maybe can get redundant. It can come to a point that it seems like it's just words, but my brother and sister, it's not just words. There's life in those words. Amen. There's life in that anointing. The power of God is coming down in full measure in this hour. Now, we'll get into this a little further here to understand what that full measure might have as an example. Amen. But ye are a chosen generation, a royal priesthood, a holy nation, a peculiar people, that ye should show forth the praises of him who hath called you out of darkness unto his marvelous light, which in time past were not a people, but are now the people of God, which had not obtained mercy, but now have obtained mercy. Amen. And it's in this junction of time. If if you'll listen to that sermon, you'll see how this scripture fits. Because all through that time in uh Noah's day, there was only one man that God saw as righteous enough to bring that word through. &gt;&gt; And we see with Moses, there was one man at that moment of time that God says, "This is the man that I can bring the word through." and right on through the ages. And we're coming right down into this age. Now, bear with me here. We're in this age. And there was one man that God chose, right? There wasn't a dozen that he brought. Or am I wrong? See, this is where some people get a little upset or confused. God brought the word to one man, but that word was given to the bride, &gt;&gt; and she is the voice now. &gt;&gt; She's the voice right now. &gt;&gt; See, so while the word was prophetically given to one man, it was disseminated out into a whole group of people that we could fulfill the word and the spirit and the bride say, "Come." Now, we can take uh Joshua and Caleb. And Caleb, you know, we've typed it this way before, even though he had a more powerful position than that. But, you know, Caleb's ministry could have been just following along behind Joshua and and saying what he just said, that's the truth. &gt;&gt; Uh hear what he just said here. Mark this down what he just said. But God gave Caleb more than that. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; He gave us more than that. Yeah. &gt;&gt; Amen. That we can now raise our voice and we can speak, we can bind, we can loose, &gt;&gt; we can deliver. You say, "Oh, oh, that's not given for us." Yes, it is. &gt;&gt; It is given for us. Amen. So, we do not want to be the limitation &gt;&gt; in this hour. Amen. Heavenly Father, Lord, we thank you, Lord, your grace and mercy. Lord, we would just ask you, Father, if you would just come this morning, speak to each and every heart. Father, encourage us today, Lord. Strengthen us. And certainly, Father, from our daytoday life, Lord, as hard as we seem to try sometimes, Lord, we have shortcomings. Forgive us of those shortcomings. For Father, we're here, Lord, to come, Lord, and be partakers. Not observers, not just a witness, but partakers. Speak to our hearts today, I pray in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen. You may be seated. Amen. So as we'll look at this verse 9, it says a chosen generation and we will understand my brother and sister that God knows his own. Isn't that wonderful that God knows exactly who's his now people misunderstand they say well if predestination that means that you didn't even have a choice. No predestination is God knowing the choice you would make. And so it's wonderful that God looking down in our life said, "I know who you are. I know my own. And I know that you will serve me. You will have hard times. You'll have trials. You'll have struggles. But at the end, you will decide, I have to serve God." Now, we'll have a quote here. I don't want to get ahead of myself. A quote here in a little bit that I think goes along with that very, very well. Now, my brother and sister, I want us to not get so used to hearing uh you're a chosen generation that we become desensitized to the reality of what that really means. Amen. Every time that a son or a daughter gets converted, Amen. gets saved, uh gets the Holy Ghost, um it it's just the start of the battle. Many times it's been pre presented that that would that would just get that and you've got it made. Well, I would agree with that. But you're going to find a lot a lot of battle, a lot of wounds, a lot of struggle, uh a lot of time, uh and and u you know, we're living in the age that the battle is in the mind. And so there'll be a lot of mind battles that we'll have to face besides the physical outside, but we'll be in this time. And but if we're not careful, we can come to a place that we hear this that we're a chosen generation so much that we just kind of feel like that that um we just got it made. It's it's done. And in one sense, that's right. Right. When you were sealed or called of God, he's not going to lose a one. So you don't have to worry about that part. But that wasn't a call for us to lay down and be lazy Christians. Amen. That actually is a call for us to rise up and to put oursel ready for the battle to put ourselves ready for the fullness of the word. Amen. Now, brother Brennham says here in the junction of time, he says here, I think this church ought to know truth and the sign where we're at that you won't be slothful, that you'll be up and doing, that the differences will be settled. Now I want to stop for just a moment and focus on that my brother and sister because people are saying well we're still looking for this moment of this time when there'll be unity comes in the bride of Jesus Christ. Well that unity my brother and sister is going to bring us or anoint us that we will settle our differences. This is not to see who has the best u black blackening uh uh ability, you know, to make someone look bad, but to literally come and settle our differences. And in that, we don't always see things the same. Amen. So, every one of us would come and we have a different perspective. We have a different idea about how things are. But as long as we can take it back to the word and we're not so rigidly fixed on our idea, then the Lord can shift us. He can lead us and guide us and show us where he wants us to go. Now, if you won't be moved, he can't take you there. &gt;&gt; So, we have to be willing to surrender ourself to go there and allow God to lead us and take us into further truth. Right? He said, "I'll lead you and guide you into all truth." Amen. You can't put the anchor down. You can't stomp on the emergency brake. You can't sit there and say, "I won't be moved." You have to be pliable. You have to let God move you. And sometimes the moving that God wants to do is he wants us to come to a place that we would be humbled enough. Amen. Now, I know that some of us are right more often than others. Well, I got a reaction out of some of you. My brother and sister, we have to come to the place that we're willing to say, I wasn't right. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; I didn't have the answer. I didn't know what I thought I knew. And we have to be able to do that. The the moving of the spirit. I I won't go into it but I I I shared this with brother Pavle a experience in in South America one time where I just thought a service was a disaster and have a deacon come and say we need you brother Paul and go and most of the church is in the altar. Now my brother and sister, you see what God was doing to Paul in that time, he was actually humbling at Paul and changing Paul's opinion or Paul's mind because what I thought was a disaster of a service only took one moment of the Holy Spirit moving down through that church. It wasn't about Paul. &gt;&gt; It never was about Paul. Paul didn't make it happen. Paul didn't He could stop it from happening, but he didn't make it happen. And we'll touch on another quote here in a minute just to reinforce that. But you see, sometimes God lets us go into hard times and struggles so that we'll learn a lesson and not forget it. &gt;&gt; How many lessons have we learned and then forgotten? But God wants his bride to learn the lessons that are going to deliver her into her rightful place in eternity. And he wants her to never forget that lesson. He wants her to come and understand what it is because you see what it is. I don't know how to put it any other way. Uh it sounds a little I don't know what a good wife. Now, I'm not saying there isn't any good wife here. Now, don't misunderstand me. But a good wife actually wants to please her husband. &gt;&gt; That's right. And it's not a one-way street. A good husband actually wants to please his wife. So, we have to in marriage, isn't this amazing how you can have two people uh raised uh you know, maybe hundreds if not thousands of miles apart and they get this crazy notion that they're in love and and and they just think, "I can't live without this young man. I can't live without this young lady. and and I I've got to have her in my life. And they say, "I do." And they do the honeymoon and they settle into life and they have to start wearing the edges off of each other because you can't take two people raised in entirely different worlds, different ideas. You see what God's doing to us? &gt;&gt; Amen. He took us out for us here. He took us out of Leodysia. We as the bride were were brought up in an entirely different atmosphere than glory. &gt;&gt; Amen. Then the atmosphere around the throne. We we have been raised up in this very very carnal, very self-centered. Uh you can find all the rest of the words. and and it's in that realm that that we have to start uh interacting and and we we come up with things like I think God would want it this way. We never even ask him. We don't know what he wants, but we're assuming because we're the bride. Amen. But when he says, this is why I took it the way I did the a good wife starting off because when he says he doesn't have a second option. &gt;&gt; That's right. He doesn't come along and say, "I think this will be good for my bride. Oh, I guess it didn't turn out like I thought." No, he knows what's good for you and I. He knows what's going to get us through this challenge of this world that we live in right now. But we are boxed in. And the only thing we know is a carnal human that has come into the presence of Almighty God. and the word is working mightily in you. Can we say amen to that this morning? This is not a feeble gospel. This is not a secondhand gospel. This is not a word that just hopes that it will work. This is a word that God says, "I'll hang heaven and earth upon my word, and it will only be my word that will not pass away." &gt;&gt; Amen. So, we're not looking here now at some gospel that we hope will work. We need to recognize that our husband has provided for us something that has such intrinsic value so powerful that we can place our very life on that and trust him. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; But look how hard it is for us sometimes to trust. Amen. Let me go back to my quote here. And I think this church, and I'm speaking to grace this morning, I think this church ought to know truth and the sign of where we're at, that you won't be slothful, that you won't be that you'll be up and doing, that the differences will be settled. Come on, saints. Whether it's husband or wife, brother or sister, we need to settle our differences. We're Christians. We're the bride of Christ. We're not We're not Pardon me. When when my daughter Kristen got married, they almost didn't allow her uh to have her wedding at the church that she had it at because the wedding previous to that, the two fathers got in a brawl in the parking lot. We're not those kind of people. We're sons and daughters of God. We're not We're not called to take our petty differences and our attitudes and and the influence of Leodysia. We're called We've got a throne. Amen. And if I can put it in this stereotype here. Amen. We've got the great car wash of the word that we're supposed to be going through. And it's going to wash us whiter than snow. And the only reason that we have these blotches is cuz we're not going through the washing of the word. See, we're supposed to be doing that. And God wants us to do that. And something in our heart wants us to do that. Something inside of us. Amen. That the differences be settled. and you'll walk like real godly men and women. Your heart set on Christ. &gt;&gt; My imagine if we now come to this place that our real focus is uh not on one another. &gt;&gt; Yeah, that's good. &gt;&gt; It's on Christ. &gt;&gt; Amen. And as I shared that little deal that I found and it's on my phone, um was reading my Bible and I found many heirs in me. &gt;&gt; See, there's where it's at, saints. We're not going to find it in the word. &gt;&gt; The word is pure. It's powerful. It's perfect. But we're going to and when we read the Bible, we're going to find heirs. But we're going to find them. They're in us. &gt;&gt; And that's what God wants us to do. Because it really takes a real Christian to be able to be cut to the very marrow of our bone and say, "Thank you, Lord." &gt;&gt; If there's any carnal life left in us, when the word cuts us to the marrow of the bone, we push back. That's the preacher's opinion. That's brother Brandham's opinion. That's this man's opinion and that man's opinion. But when you have a real experience with God and the word cuts you right down to the marrow of your bone, you say, "Lord, help me. &gt;&gt; Help me, Lord. I want to I want to be what this word says I'm supposed to be. I want the very life that's in these words to be living in me." &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; Oh, and it's not a insult or you're not defaming yourself to actually admit &gt;&gt; that God still needs to work on you. &gt;&gt; Amen. We We don't have to. It's not demeaning to say, "Oh, I guess I would sound like I'm not a very good Christian. I sound like I'm weak or I sound like I still have things in my life." No, my brother and sister, the scripture says that confession's good. &gt;&gt; Amen. So, why don't we just be bold enough to confess that I I still need the Lord. I need the word to work on me. &gt;&gt; Amen. And and I I'm pushing into that. &gt;&gt; Does it sometimes make us look like we are coming short? Yeah, it does. But I would rather see it and be able to correct it &gt;&gt; than to be blinded. &gt;&gt; Right. &gt;&gt; And never correct it. That's right. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; The correction, the scripture says correction's good. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; The love of God, a good father &gt;&gt; corrects his child. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. So, as we look at this, see, we really need to be careful that we don't create our own truth. &gt;&gt; That's right. Amen. &gt;&gt; Now, if we study, we pray, we read our Bible, and we can create our own truth, you might say. Now, I'm going to put it out like this here for an example. Our own truth might be that we think every sister should dress like we make our wife dress. Was that straightforward enough or should I ramp it up a little more? Met men before now it's their preference. It's their wife. But I've met men before that complained to me as a fellow minister that he didn't like these sisters that curl their hair all curly. Okay. Oh my. Let's all focus on Sister Ruth. &gt;&gt; I know that's my I'm going to use you for an example. If I don't know Sister Ruth, I would be thinking that she spent all morning with one of those things going crimp, crimp, crimp, crimp. So people get ideas that become their own reality. &gt;&gt; And they judge everything by their reality. &gt;&gt; And so in that, how can you really truly love someone you're judging? Right? &gt;&gt; Because if you really love them and you thought they were wrong, you would call them out in church. &gt;&gt; No, &gt;&gt; you would pray for them. &gt;&gt; Prophet gave us a very clear example. You pray for them. &gt;&gt; Amen. Thank you for not being offended, Sister Ruth. But it was a perfect example. So you see my brother and sister, we can have our own version of what we think the word means. Amen. They sang this special this morning, the opening of the seals, what it meant. Now, people that believe this message would be offended at that song. &gt;&gt; I'm I'm just going to be straight forward with you. There'd be people that would be offended at that song. that there's no way we could understand, we could have no real revelation that the opening of the seals was for the prophet and the prophet alone. &gt;&gt; But that's not what the prophet said. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; So in the opening of the seals, what is it doing? It's showing us where we come from, who we are, and where we're going. And it showed it so clearly, my brother and sister, that every son and daughter of God that's anointed by the spirit of God, the Holy Ghost, is going to recognize that. Thank you, Lord, that I see where I come from. I see who I am and I see where I am going. &gt;&gt; Amen. God did not want that to remain a mystery in your life or my life. He wants that to be very, very clear that we could recognize that. Amen. You You don't You don't go out on a journey unless you got nothing better to do in your life. You don't go on a journey and drive down the road and say, "You know what? I think I'll take two lefts and a right and then go straight and see where that takes me." No, you look at the road map and you see this is my destination. And our destination as the bride of Jesus Christ is clearly explained in the opening of the seals. Amen. and a why that we are here today and who we are and what God called us to be. Amen. It's not just a journey of uncertainties. But as a real believer, Amen. we've come to this junction of time which is called the last church age. But even within the last church age, there's these smaller junctions that we come to. Amen. And the prophet of God, I won't go into it this morning. It' take a little bit. But the prophet of God as he's preaching bringing the message down 63 64 65 he's actually laying out the description of these junctions. Amen. And I'll just use the very simplest one. He comes to a place. He says, "I'll no longer call you church. I'll call you bride." Amen. What was that adjunction that we come to that we're no longer just a church, but we are the bride of Jesus Christ? Can we say amen to that today? We are that bride the prophet of God was talking about. We've come to that junction, but there's junctions since then. &gt;&gt; Amen. There's junctions that have come since then. Amen. So, you see, if we have to be careful not to create our own truth of our version of what we think the word meant, brother Brandham, and I didn't put quotes here because I didn't know which one of the 50 to to do. So, but brother Brown talks several places. He talks about a one-man denomination. So, we can become a denomination in ourself that I am right. I have the answers. God spoke to me. They're wrong. They don't know what they're talking about. I am the one. Amen. Now, look, my brother and sister, you'll find that there are times that good people get ideas in their head and it takes them. And I remember many years ago, I won't name names just in case you might know him, but this brother had determined that God had called him to be the one to announce the convocation of the opening of the finish, the start of the finish of the word. He wrote me and several other brothers many letters and and I felt I felt kind of privileged that he would view me as such that he said I want you to be the opening speaker and I want you to be the closing speaker. I don't remember him saying I prayed about it. He just made a decision that I mean just think saints how impressive that is to be the guy who gets to preach the sermon that starts the rapture. But I couldn't find anywhere to support his claim that God said &gt;&gt; I had to politely. It didn't turn out quite so well. I need to go to diplomacy school. But I had to take him back in the word and then he become offended. And then after I was at one moment chosen to be this special speaker after I told him I don't see it in the word, God changed his mind and I wasn't a speaker at all. That's how you become a one-man denomination. &gt;&gt; You set the groundwork of what everyone else must accept and do and believe and how they must live and how No, my brother and sister, this is not this is not what God wants. He wants you and I to be fully committed to his word. Amen. Not committed to our version of his word, but to pray for revelation. Amen. The prophet of God. I know maybe we've wore that out but the prophet of God said you're going to pray for one thing pray for revelation. Amen. My my brother and sister you know the Holy Ghost is a revelation. So it's not like he put having praying for the Holy Ghost out of the picture. It is a revelation. Amen. Many things in this Bible that we have and this message that we have is a revelation. Amen. You go out here, the next man down the road, he says, "I don't see it." But to you and I, it is so clear on the page that we see it and we say, "How can they not see this?" &gt;&gt; And we do our very best in the human element to convince them. &gt;&gt; But my brother and sister, we can't convince them because they were not appointed to that. &gt;&gt; Now, I'm not speaking that to be harsh, but simply there are people, Amen. We've got the picture of I call her a sister uh on our fridge that many years ago uh it was just some very supernatural things but it come down to just uh uh they could not accept that the trinity wasn't true and I'll share this much of the story. The church they come out of didn't baptize you until you were like 40 years old. That way you'd have enough time to be fully committed. What are we going to do about our children? &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; That know that God's called them. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And it's a fire burning in their soul. &gt;&gt; Do we tell them wait another 30 or 40 years? &gt;&gt; No. Something out of a one-man doctrine. But I tell you how gracious God is. Here they are. Their exact age I don't remember at the moment. When she went to get baptized, they're there and the man got confused. He just baptized her husband in the Trinity and he's standing out there in the Snake River. And he goes to baptize her and he says, "I baptize you in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ." Brings her up out of the water and says, "I I don't know why I said that. &gt;&gt; Do you want me to baptize you and father son?" She says, "Nope." &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. Now, I'm telling you, my brother and sister, God knows his own. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. Now, there's be things in their life that I don't see. I don't understand. She's now passed. But my brother and sister, you see that God knows his own. He's willing to deal with his own the way he chooses to deal with his own. &gt;&gt; He's not asking you and I to give an opinion on how he should deal with this. Amen. &gt;&gt; He just wants us to come and stand solid on the word and trust the word, obey the word, be washed by the word. Amen. And confess the word. &gt;&gt; Amen. So now when you look at these things like this, you'll see that as God is doing uh if if we're not careful, we become a one-man denomination, &gt;&gt; one woman, one person, however you want to put it because we are sure we know the answer. &gt;&gt; My remember this just a random thought that's not random. I think God just gave this to me. Remember, brother Brandham, a family, their son snuck out, went down the highway, d died in a car crash. You remember that story? And they come to brother Brandham. What happened? What's we don't understand what's happened to our son now? He's dead. Brother Brandham says, you know, I'll I'll go seek the face of the Lord. You guys remember that story? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Brother Brandham comes back and tells the family. I went, reached out, asked the Lord to give me understanding. I reached out and he's in a place of great light. A kid who snuck out of his house, went and got in a car with some other friends. Usually those kind of attitudes don't really bode well, right? But God knew his own. &gt;&gt; And when he shows Brother Brandham where that young man's at, he shows him a place of light. &gt;&gt; It isn't the light of the flicker of the fires of hell. But it's a great glowing light. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. Now, Brother Brandham could not guarantee that child, you know, he couldn't guarantee to the parents, but he did see what he saw. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. and he reported what he saw. &gt;&gt; And he didn't come to change the scripture. He didn't come to change anything. All he did is testify of what he saw. That didn't make him a one-man denomination. He was testifying of what God had revealed to him. Amen. And we're here today. Each one of us, our experience as believers is a little bit different. And some will say, "Oh, I saw it like this." And some would say, "You know what? Like brother Barry Coffey's testimony, you know, being raised up in the Catholic church and then going over on his great world journey and going to all of these places." You I don't know if all of you know that testimony, but if you don't, you ought to find it and listen to it. Amen. Because it shows how that brother Barry, long-haired, smoked cigarettes, whatever it was, it's there that he's doing that. And then God brings him to these places and everything that he was doing left a dissatisfaction in him, &gt;&gt; left a void in him. &gt;&gt; Amen. They went I can't even think of the name of that um where the fountain is. &gt;&gt; It It's pretty funny story. I have to share. Sorry, I I can't remember all the details, but over there there's this supposedly this supernatural event took place and and there's water running from the rock and brother Barry being brother Barry, he goes over there and he's looking at this thing and then he walks around on the back side of it and then he's telling all of his friends, "There's a pipe here. This is not water coming out of a rock. THIS IS A PIPE RIGHT HERE." And they're all like, "Oh, we don't care. The water's still coming out of the rock. &gt;&gt; It was the only one of that group. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; That that affected &gt;&gt; Brother Barry. &gt;&gt; But what was God doing? He was moving Brother Barry. He didn't move those other men. &gt;&gt; Amen. He was moving Brother Barry. &gt;&gt; Amen. And that's what God's doing. Amen. Whether it's a pipe and a rock or something supernatural, you have your own little vision. You have your own little situation, a dream, and it comes to pass perfectly. And you look at that. That was for you. It's not for the world. It's not to cause the whole world to line up to your point of view. God gave you something special for you to come to a place and say, "You know what? God was dealing with me." &gt;&gt; Amen. Lord, help us. &gt;&gt; Not to be a denomination. &gt;&gt; Now, in the sermon, end time evangelism says Jesus counts character, not members. You know that he counts characters. God has always tried to get one man in his hand. That's all he needs is one man. He'll do his work through the years. Just think he could only find one righteous man in the time of Noah. In the time of Moses, he only found one righteous man. Now look at paragraph 194 here and look at Samson. See, God can only use what you surrender to him. &gt;&gt; Now, think about this. Here's Samson was a big strong man. He had a lot of strength. Samson surrendered his strength to God, but he wouldn't give his heart. &gt;&gt; So, we can come to the place that we in our one-man denomination feel like if I sacrifice this, then everything else is settled. It's finished. But God wants the heart. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. We can we can you know what is it? Lint or whatever you know I got a friend I'm sorry that's probably a little over the side but I got a friend you know and he just out of nowhere tells me yeah we chose as a family uh our sacrifice for Lent. I'm like oh I'm interested. Tell me we're not going to eat chocolate during Lent. Okay. Okay. You're going to gorge on chocolate before Lent and you're going to gorge on chocolate after Lent, &gt;&gt; but for those few short days, no chocolate. &gt;&gt; Is that really a surrender? Is that really a sacrifice? No, my brother and sister, if we're not careful, though, we'll create something of our own thinking. &gt;&gt; I'll give this up. &gt;&gt; But he said he wouldn't give up his heart. The quote goes on if you want to go look it up. He says he gave it to Delilah. &gt;&gt; So totally carnal. You know, we won't go into Delilah. &gt;&gt; But Samson wasn't the only man on earth that Delilah had entertained. &gt;&gt; So he wouldn't give his heart to God, but he give it to Delilah. So you see what it was is he had reasoned in his mind that at this junction of time in his life if I just give God my strength in fact the quote goes on further and brother Brandham says I probably should have posted that. Brother Brandham says you know they'll give all kinds of money pay off the church uh remodel the church make a more beautiful church they'll do all of this but they won't give their heart &gt;&gt; that's it &gt;&gt; to God. Amen. &gt;&gt; That's a one-man denomination. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Because they're giving what they want to give, &gt;&gt; not what God asks for. &gt;&gt; Are we good? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; No. So, we come to a junction. 1 Corinthians the 2 chapter 11-16. For what man knoweth the things of a man, save the spirit of a man which is in him? Even so, the things of God knoweth no man, but the spirit of God. So, let's just go back to the first part of verse 11. Amen. We know, this is going to sound blunt, forgive me. We know what it's like to have the spirit of a man. We have lied. We have cheated. We have stolen. We have lusted of the flesh. We have all these things. We know what it is to be the spirit of a man. &gt;&gt; Brothers, can you say amen? &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; There's there's where it's at. We know what it's like to be in that position. But I tell you what we really need to be is to know what it is to be in the spirit of God. &gt;&gt; Amen. There's the one that really matters is not in the spirit of man, but to be in the spirit of God. To know what that is like. To be able to testify of that. To have young men that would come and say, "You know what? I I'm struggling with this. I I don't know what to do. And be able to come and hear words of not how carnal we were, not how wicked we were, that we were the biggest drunk, that we were the biggest this, the biggest that, but to say, "Hey, there's a spirit out here called the Holy Spirit. It will come in this junction of time. It will deliver you." &gt;&gt; Amen. It'll pull you out of that darkness. It'll pull you out of that &gt;&gt; and set you free. Amen. Now, we've received not the spirit of the world, but the spirit which is of God, that we might know the things that are freely given to us. Imagine rejecting things freely given to us. God says, "Here it is. I know my own. I know what you need." &gt;&gt; Yeah. And we would say, "I know what I want &gt;&gt; and they don't match." &gt;&gt; I'm not being too blunt, am I today? Are we okay? &gt;&gt; No. &gt;&gt; But the natural man receiveth not the things of the spirit of God, for they are foolishness unto him, neither can he know them, because they are spiritually discerned. But he that is spiritual judgeth all things, yet he himself is judge of no man. For who hath known the mind of the Lord, that he may instruct him. I love the closing of this verse. Amen. Because it comes down and so emphatically drives down that stake. Amen. Can you rejoice with me? The word says, "But we have the mind of Christ." &gt;&gt; Amen. So we can sat here this morning not boastful, not coming here as arrogant or or narcissistic or any of those things, my brother and sister, but the word says that you have the mind of Christ. And that is what changes our whole picture, changes us from carnal men into spiritual men, changes us from every issue we had in our life to a life full of liberty is because God has allowed. He's opened up the seventh seal and allowed his mind to come down. People say, "What about those other six ages? What is happening?" They received their portion, but they have not receive what God gave to you. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. This is the age where God said, "I'm going to pour out all of the mystery on people. It will all COME TO PASS. IT WILL ALL BE FULFILLED." SO, we're sitting here today. Amen. And one of the greatest gifts. I mean, how would you turn down any gift from God? &gt;&gt; But do you realize how great the gift is when God says, "I'm going to let you even have my own mind. &gt;&gt; He's already given us his heart. He's already poured his spirit into us. He's done all these other things. And now he says, "Wait, I'll cause you to even think like me. Oh boy. You talk about something special. &gt;&gt; Amen. We're not thinking like Le Oysia. I'm sorry to say it this way. Maybe we should mute the mic. Amen. I don't want to think like Mr. Trump. I don't want to think like all of these other people, you know, the Bezos and whatever these names are. I I don't I don't even want to think like them. I want to have the mind of Christ. I want his Holy Spirit to come down in me. Amen. To where when I'm thinking, I think his thoughts. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. What a junction in time that we've come to, saints, that God is pouring his word into a bride. And she's here to receive that and to act on that word in the exact same fashion that Jesus Christ would if he was standing here right now. &gt;&gt; That is incredible. See, we're coming to a junction where the word is more real than our own thoughts. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; The word is so much more real to us. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Everything about it. Amen. Where the promise of God is more real than what we feel or see. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Wait. Leodysia is like a mud hole. You climb in, it sticks to you. &gt;&gt; You don't get into the wallow of Leodysia and walk out clean. That's right. &gt;&gt; You need some washing. Now, look, I know this is probably not appropriate, but I'm going to say it anyway. We raised hogs for way too long. All you had to do is walk through those buildings by those pins and you'd go back and people would be like, "You stink." &gt;&gt; That's le oysia. &gt;&gt; You don't have to run jump in. You just walk by it. &gt;&gt; This is why we need the washing of the word. &gt;&gt; Amen. I didn't sin. I didn't lie, cheat, steal, lust in the flesh. I didn't do all these. No, but you just walked right down through there. You need a washing. &gt;&gt; Amen. Are you with me? &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; That's the world we live in. &gt;&gt; That's what God's doing for us. &gt;&gt; Amen. See, this voice I I just talking with a brother here a few days ago, you know, and and uh this voice, you know, people are saying that's just the voice of a man. I'm here to tell you it's not the voice of a man. Amen. It's not attracted to the man. That voice that resonates something deep, something full in us, touches us where we live, that's not the voice of a man. Amen. That's God behind that voice. Just like God is behind your voice. And I would put it to you this direct. Have you ever encouraged someone and made an absolute difference in their life by your words of encouragement? What was it? Was it your voice? &gt;&gt; Was it you? It was God behind you. Amen. Speaking out cuz you spoke things you didn't even know &gt;&gt; and touch their life. &gt;&gt; Amen. So, it's not a man's voice. &gt;&gt; This word touches us. It has what we need. &gt;&gt; Amen. Got it. &gt;&gt; Now look at this here. Don't let me get too sidetracked here. &gt;&gt; The Lord knew what would attract you. &gt;&gt; Right. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; He knew exactly. &gt;&gt; You see some people it's the supernatural. Now this is not what they end up focusing on. This what God uses for an attraction. Some it's the supernatural, some it's deep things. They're intellectual thinking kind of men. Amen. Our brother stroke off the book that he wrote. Somebody said, "Why did you write such a hard book to read?" And he said, "I didn't write it for you. I wrote it for my other fellow rocket scientists." So God put that in their lap so that they could read it with words I've never even heard of. &gt;&gt; But they have. They know what those words mean. &gt;&gt; They think that way. They needed something deep. &gt;&gt; Otherwise, it's boring. It's for the simple peasants. &gt;&gt; I've met a few people like that. And some it's all about simplicity. And some want it to shake and move like nothing's ever shook or moved their life. But how do we reconcile this? Some pulled by supernatural, some by deep things, some by simplicity, some wanting to be shook. Well, Matthew 24:28 says, "For wheresoever the carcass is, that's right, there will the eagles be gathered together." So, it don't matter if you are a highly intellectual person. You like to keep life at the simplest level. You know God is real, but you don't need to to, you know, have heavens and earth, so to speak, shook to prove it to you. You see, what attracted every one of these types of personalities was a carcass. That's what drew them. That's what drew you. &gt;&gt; And I will put it this way a little bit strong maybe. If anything else drew you besides the carcass, &gt;&gt; then get ready to be shook out. &gt;&gt; It's kind of straightforward. I don't mean to be offensive, but if anything other than the carcass drew you, &gt;&gt; sooner or later, you will be like the wheat seed along the side of the road and it'll be choked out. It'll dry up. It'll do all these different things. Amen. But on the good soil, &gt;&gt; on the good soil, wheresoever the carcass is, there will the eagles be gathered together. See, it's a body word of the son of man. &gt;&gt; And what is that? It's another junction in time. And when that body word come down and started to be revealed to a bride, started to be revealed to a people and they were able to take a hold of that and say, I I may not be very smart. I may not be this, I may not be that, but that's the truth and that's who I am. See God bringing them to that junction in time. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; What was attracting us? Let me hurry up, get finished here. Anointed ones at the end time. Now, I like how this is. Remember in our conversation, Brother Pavle, I was telling you about some of these things we experienced and how you say things. You don't know. You're a little shocked by what you say. You didn't have any information. You said something without any natural knowledge. It just come out of you. Look what brother Brown says here. I wasn't the one that appeared down on the river. I was only standing there when he appeared. &gt;&gt; I'm not the one that performs these things and foretells these things that happens as perfect as they are. I'm only one that's near when he does it. &gt;&gt; Amen. You hold on to that right there and you'll never get a big head. Right. Amen. The scripture says that that uh uh you shouldn't have a novice for your pastor lest he be lifted up. &gt;&gt; See what happens is is God comes down does some things and some people say, "Wow, man. I'm the I'm the man, &gt;&gt; but they need this revelation. &gt;&gt; God just allowed him to be there." &gt;&gt; Amen. When he did the work. &gt;&gt; Amen. when he does it. I'm only a voice that he used to say it. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Man, this just kills some of these people what they &gt;&gt; what they're trying to make Brother Brandham into. This just kills them. They don't quote this. &gt;&gt; They don't quote this quote. &gt;&gt; Because when they do, they would have to acknowledge that brother Brandham is pushing himself entirely away from this and saying, "It's not me, it's the Lord." &gt;&gt; Amen. But they Well, anyway, we won't go there. See, now, Brother David preached on this the other day, and I thought it was good. Really straightforward, pretty bold. He didn't He didn't You didn't see him up here shredding any lavender and sharing the smell out in the church, you know? So, you'd all be like, "That hurt, but it sure smelled good." But look where it comes from. It wasn't what I knew. &gt;&gt; It's what I just surrendered myself to. &gt;&gt; That fit every one of us in this building today. &gt;&gt; It won't be what you know. You might be able to quote this message, right? And front and back and sideways, it won't matter. But if you haven't surrendered yourself, so we already had that quote, right? We're seeing where Samson gave his strength, but he wouldn't give his heart. &gt;&gt; Amen. So, here we are. now makes you wonder just how this all fits together. Amen. Because it wasn't what I knew, it's what I surrendered myself to that he spoke through. It isn't me. It wasn't the seventh angel. Oh no, it was the manifestation of the son of man. It wasn't the angel, his message. It was the mystery that God unfolded. Come on, my brother and sister. Every supernatural thing that any minister has ever spoke of and discerned and ever hit something that went right in your life, it wasn't that preacher. It was God coming down saying, "This is my son. This is my daughter. And I'm going to have a conversation with you today. I want to keep you from going over here and getting sidetracked or derailed. I'm going to do this." &gt;&gt; Oh, and I'll use this man to do it. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Yeah. Look, it's not a man. It's God. The angel was not the son of man. He was a messenger from the son of man. The son of man is Christ. He is the one that you're feeding on. Amen. Back to the carcass. Wherever the carcass is, the bride is going to be there. Amen. He was a messenger. Amen. From the son of man. The son of man is Christ. He's the one that you're feeding on. You're not feeding on a man. &gt;&gt; Oh my. &gt;&gt; I know this is straightforward, saints, but remember I read you a quote and some of you even said, "Amen." That we need to know the truth. &gt;&gt; We need to know the truth. It needs to be brought out as sugarcoating it, never touching it is not truth. &gt;&gt; We need to be able to recognize the spirits of the day want us to turn brother Brandham into Daniel as he was there in the kingdom. And those Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego were not going to worship Daniel. &gt;&gt; They absolutely refused even as it was to go to the fiery furnace. We will not bow down. &gt;&gt; Amen. And that same spirit has not died. It's here today. Did God send us a prophet? He opened the word. It changed our lives. It set us free. IT GAVE US REVELATION. BUT HE'S NOT OUR GOD. &gt;&gt; AMEN. Our God IS JESUS CHRIST. AMEN. And Jesus Christ has come to change your LIFE TO CHANGE MY LIFE to bring us to a place we come into a junction of time. And as it were, if we have to face a fiery furnace, I'll face it. Amen. If I have to, you know, come through fiery trials, a lion's den, whatever it might be, I'll face it. But I'm not going to worship the man. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; I'm going to worship my Lord Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. And you see what we're doing? I got ahead of myself. We're coming to another junction &gt;&gt; in time. &gt;&gt; Got it. &gt;&gt; Some and I'll throw you for a loop. &gt;&gt; Rightfully so. Look at Brother Brand and thought he was God. When I say rightfully so, because they saw so much of Christ manifested in him, &gt;&gt; but they didn't even listen to his own preaching. &gt;&gt; They didn't listen to his own words. &gt;&gt; Because if they did, they would say he was a messenger sent to us. &gt;&gt; He was a carrier. &gt;&gt; You know, I ordered something the other day. Well, actually, Sister Jerry ordered it come Amazon. I was happy that it came. I didn't run out and bow down at the feet of the Amazon driver. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Come on. &gt;&gt; That's a poor analogy, but it needs to be that &gt;&gt; that ridiculous. &gt;&gt; Amen. We have one that we are called to worship. &gt;&gt; That is our Lord Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; We're coming into that junction of time that we will be there. Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego said, "We won't bow down." Now, my brother and sister, they could have found a way to compromise. Would it be okay if we sat down? Would it be okay if we found another way to honor? No. They said, "Not happening. &gt;&gt; We're not going to bow down. We don't We have one that we worship. We're coming into this junction of time that that is repeating itself &gt;&gt; here. Not here. I pray not here, &gt;&gt; but repeating itself again &gt;&gt; once again. &gt;&gt; But there'll be a people, Amen. Is there any people here that are not going to bow down? &gt;&gt; Amen. Going to stand up and say, "Look, I I've got one redeemer. I've got one savior. I've got one healer. I've got one provider. I don't need another. I don't need a substitute. I don't need someone to fill that void in. There's nothing. People say, "Well, Brother Brandham didn't finish up his message." That's right. Because God knew he gave to the bride. The bride would pray for revelation and she would get what she needed. And because brother Brandham also makes a statement said this will not be a public show. Amen. That's the only way. Imagine if God come down and we had great teaching seminars on what the seals were, great teaching seminars on all these things. My brother and sister, let me tell you, we were in that conference in Europe. In that conference right there, 7800 people, there are people of every persuasion in the message there. Now, they have an agreement, you might say, amongst themselves that we're not going to come here and argue doctrine. We're not going to fight with each other. But that agreement, do you think that took away their belief? &gt;&gt; No. There's only one thing will take away that belief and consolidate that, and that's the Holy Ghost. &gt;&gt; So, you see, we're coming to a junction of the Holy Ghost. &gt;&gt; That's where we're coming to. &gt;&gt; Oh, hope you don't throw me out of here. If you do, throw me softly. It's not whether you go to a message church or not. &gt;&gt; I know some Baptists that make us all almost look ashamed for how they read their Bibles. &gt;&gt; And so, is it just reading your Bible? &gt;&gt; No. &gt;&gt; I hope I'm not offending anybody. &gt;&gt; No. &gt;&gt; But now we have a move in the message. lapel pins and ink pins and &gt;&gt; even belt buckles are coming back. &gt;&gt; I don't say this to mock anybody, but when I was a kid, you weren't in the message unless you had an eagle belt buckle. &gt;&gt; So, you could walk around church and see who was serious about the message. &gt;&gt; They don't have an eagle belt buckle. They don't really believe. Oh, and with the eagle belt buckle, you needed a cowboy hat. And if you had a cowboy hat, you needed your own version of a blondie, the rifle. &gt;&gt; Uhhuh. &gt;&gt; Then that was evidence you were the message. Nothing about having the Holy Ghost. &gt;&gt; Not h nothing about being led by the Holy Spirit. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You know, there's nothing new under the sun. &gt;&gt; And these things are cycling once again. &gt;&gt; They're coming back. We need a little icon. Do you know we were there in the Netherlands? Well, that was actually Germany. They have the bones of the three wise men in that cathedral in Cologne. Now, how those bones ever made it to Cologne, Germany? And how, if you ever drop those, would you know which bone was which? I'm going to offend you. &gt;&gt; Some segments of this message &gt;&gt; are almost that bad. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Today, &gt;&gt; what are we doing? We're coming to another junction and time. &gt;&gt; God, help us. Sister Vikica, would you come? God, help us to make the right decision. Amen. To have the right understanding. Amen. To see that. I got one more quote. I skip over a few things in my notes here. I got one more quote. What is the attraction on the mountain? I love this. When I read this the other day, I just got excited about this. That's what the attraction is. The predestinated seed of God who can't do nothing else but follow it means more than life to us. &gt;&gt; My how simple can it get? &gt;&gt; You can't even help yourself. &gt;&gt; Wait, I believe the message. &gt;&gt; I did. You really? Or the scripture says it's Christ in you? &gt;&gt; That's exactly it. &gt;&gt; It's Christ in us. Amen. &gt;&gt; We've come in that junction, my brother and sister. When you see something good, you see something supernatural, you see something that that just is so outstanding, you just like, "Wow." I give you an example. I'm not I'm not talking about Paul. I was just there when it happened. Had a sister one time call me say, "My little baby girl, she's got like 106, seven fever. scared me. I'm like, "Oh my." And she said, "Brother Paul, do you know anybody in our area that could come and pray for my baby? They didn't live around here." And I said, "Honestly, sister, I don't. But why don't you &gt;&gt; lay your hand &gt;&gt; on that baby? Pray the prayer of faith &gt;&gt; and watch God honor your your prayer. God honor you as a daughter of God. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; She called me back like 40 minutes later and said, "The fever's gone." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; What is it, my brother and sister? We don't need to look to another person. You're the bride of Christ. God called you. He poured his word into you, and his word is life. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. He poured that into you. Amen. Let's stand up and take what is rightfully ours. Amen. And claim what is rightfully ours and speak what is rightfully ours and act upon it. Very first quote I read to you there. God doesn't want us being just laying around. He wants us to get up and do something. Hallelujah. God bless you today. Thank you for your patience. Amen. Let's just stand worship the Lord a little bit. Amen. Hallelujah. 10:31 Brother Isaac F ever. Hallelu Hering God. Can you say amen to that? Oh hallelu is an answering God. And when I pray in Jesus name and by faith the answer came. Oh hallelu is an answering God. Oh hallelu is an answering God. Oh, hallelujah. He's an answering God. Oh, when I pray in Jesus name and by faith the answer came. Oh, hallelu. He's an answering door. 10:16. Amen. Is he in the house this morning? &gt;&gt; Amen. Hallelujah. Brother Alex G. Yeah. Sorry about that. Little girl was lying there and people all &gt;&gt; laughed at Jesus and he said she's only free. As he took her by the hand, she began to live again. Some began to praise the Lord. Some began to say, "He's in the house. Death has to flee. Now there is light. Where darkness used to be, now there is hope. There's no more doubt. Praise his name. Praise his name. He's in the house. We were like that little girl, dead in all our sins. Till Jesus touched this heart of mine and gave me life again. I am just a house of clay. Ever since that blessed day, there's a light that shines on me for all the world to see. He's in the house. Death has to flee. Now there is light where darkness used to be. Now there is hope. There's no more doubt. Praise his name. Praise his name. He's in the house. Amen. Number 651, please. KFC. I know not why God's wonderous grace to me he hath made known. Or why unworthy Christ in love redeemed me before his throne. But I know whom I have believed and am persuaded that he is aable to keep that which I've committed unto him against that day. I know not how this saving faith to me he did. Nor how believing in his word brought peace within my heart. But I know whom I have believed in and am persuaded that he is able to keep that which I've committed unto him against that day. I know not how the spirit moves, convinceing men of sin, revealing Jesus through the word, reating faith in him. But I know whom I have believed and am persuaded that he is aable to keep that which I've committed unto him against that day. I know not what of good or ill may be reserved for me. Of weyer ways your golden days before his face I see. But I know whom I have believed and am persuaded that he is able to keep that which I've committed not to him against that day. And I know not when my Lord may come at night or noon day fair. Nor if I'll walk the veil with him or meet him in the air. But I know who I have believed it and am persuaded that he is aable to keep that which I've committed unto him against that day. But I know whom I have believed in and am persuaded that he is able to keep that which I've committed unto him against that day. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. Stay in the key of seal sing uh lead me Lord and I will follow. Oh lead me Lord I will follow. Lead me Lord, I will go. You have called me. I will answer. Lead me, Lord. I will go. One more time.
