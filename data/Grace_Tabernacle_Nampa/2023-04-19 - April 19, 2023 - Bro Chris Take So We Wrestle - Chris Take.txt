amen amen thank you musicians my mic's still off that's good it's off oh I forgot the batteries I'm sorry I forgot the batteries in the pack can you grab thank you if you have your Bibles tonight we'll turn to Genesis chapter 32 good to be back with y'all you got this one now how about now good no mic here are you sure okay I'll just hold this one tonight Genesis chapter 32 it's going to be back tonight with everyone thank you for your prayers for the trip it's all it all went really well God God spoke to the heart of the people and both in chivac and uh brother rich rich Cobbs and uh so we said we bring greetings back from I don't know Tabernacle and uh for the rich as well of course whether they tell me to or not we'll bring it back so Genesis chapter 32 and Jacob went on his way and the angels of God met him and when Jacob saw them he said this is God's host and he called the name of that place mahanim and Jacob sent Messengers before him to Esau his brother unto the land of seer the country of Edom and he commanded them saying thus shall you speak unto my Lord Esau and thy servant Jacob saith thus I have sojourned with Laban and stayed there until now and I have oxen and asses flocks and Men servants and women servants and I have sent to tell my Lord that I may find Grace in thy sight and The Messengers returned to Jacob saying we came to thy brother Esau and also he cometh to meet thee and 400 men with him then Jacob was greatly afraid and distressed and he divided the people that was with him and the flocks and herds and the camels into two bands and said if he saw come to the one company and smite it then the other company which is left shall escape and Jacob said oh god of My Father Abraham and God of my father Isaac the Lord would say it said set us unto me return unto thy country into thy Kindred and I will deal well with thee I am not worthy of the least of all the Mercies and of all the truth which thou has showed unto thy servant for with my staff I passed over this Jordan and now I am become two bands deliver me I pray thee from the hand of my brother from the hand of his offer I fear Him lest he will come and smite me and the mother with the children and thou said as thy will surely do the good and make thy seed as the sand of the sea which cannot be numbered for multitude and he lodged there that same night and took up took of that which came to his hand at present for Esau his brother amen may the Lord blessing to the reading of his words you may be seated tonight so my title tonight is so re-wrestle and my subtitle is the enduring will of God so Genesis in Genesis chapter 32 we read we read the beginning of the the ending of Jacob and uh the beginning of Israel a prince with God and Jacob prays to God in this prayer but he's nothing happens at that point in time he's still goes on he still divides up the family he still splits it all up and God knows when when we were when we're ready God knows when when we're at perfect pressure and um he knows exactly what he's doing in Luke chapter 22 verse 39. at one point in time I was a barista and um when you make coffee when you make espresso you have to there's a lot of things that have to go that go into a perfect shot in including coffee and the the course you grind up the coffee and you pack it into What's called the portafilter that little thing they pop on there and there's a cylinder inside that that builds pressure if your coffee is too coarse the pressure won't build properly and it'll run through the coffee too soon and you'll get a weak shot if the pressure if the grind of the coffee is too fine the pressure builds too much and it'll burn the shot so you have to have the right amount of of the exact right amount of pressure and there's a little gauge you can see it's on the some of the machines and God when he he deals with you it's the same way he knows the exact amount of pressure to put you underneath he he looks at you and and he looked at Mary Magdalene who was at the tomb on the first Easter Sunday she was looking for Jesus and the body's gone she goes and gets the disciples and a couple disciples they come back Peter says I don't know the other disciple believes they leave Mary's there and she begins to weep she's been under so much pressure since Friday and we look at that and we say poor Mary the pressure that she's underneath but God looked at that and said she's still two degrees from perfect pressure and then she she hears a voice behind her and she turns around and she sees the man who she think is thinks is the gardener and she says sir you know if you've done something with my Lord please tell me and he says a few words and then she turns and he and Jesus who was the gardener Jesus says Mary because right at that point in time she was at perfect pressure and when she he said Mary she recognized who he was perfect shot and she he tells Mary he says Mary go quickly and tell my disciples I have risen because Peter is at is five still five degrees from perfect pressure go quickly and tell him because I I don't want to miss the shot Thomas everyone meets pressure perfect shot Thomas he's still two degrees from perfect pressure so Jesus says Thomas come touch my hands come put your hand in my side perfect shot we look at our circumstances and we say the pressure is too great or we say I am breaking under the pressure but God's just pulling a perfect shot because you and I are Sons and Daughters of God and God never ever ever makes a mistake everything the disciples were put through think about that was their friend three years night and day you know me in the trip me and Alex did to Alaska in February ah man I missed him we were together for a whole week and a half imagine being together with somebody like that for three and a three and a half or three years and then now all of the plans they had in their head fell apart how many times in our lives have all the plans that we had in our head falling apart and we say wow everything's falling apart and God says no no perfect shot [Applause] he knows exactly how much to to grind you down he knows how much to grind you down before you he even puts you in the cylinder the Piston he knows exactly how much to grind you down until you're in the position now Jesus ground Peter down Peter no you'll deny me three times denies his Lord denies his best friend and curses while doing it but God was grinding him and then God was pressing him there's Beauty in the pressing we know you press of rose right you crush a rose you get perfume from it Luke chapter 22 verse 39 and he came out and went as he walked to the Mount of Olives and his disciples also followed him and when he was at the place he said unto them pray that she entered not into temptation and he was withdrawn from them about a stone's cast and kneeled down and prayed he didn't know he didn't know sleeping was temptation take care of yourself get the rest that you need so when the tempter of sleep comes you will not fall and he was withdrawn from them about a stone's cast and kneeled down and prayed saying father if thou be willing remove this cup from me nevertheless not my will but thine be done what a position we can I can stand here and I can preach that but when I walk that when you walk that there is nothing amazing about it there it you pray the same thing Lord take this pressure from me take this away from me so we wrestle what was Peter doing Peter was face to face with his Humanity and he wrestled how many times do we come to places in our life where God says all right it's time to step higher so what does he do he doesn't give you some great Revelation he puts you face to face with yourself and you say he's in the way she's in the way that is one of the most difficult things to do to face yourself to see your Humanity because we all live with our Humanity but when God reveals to us our discrepancies when God reveals to us our failings we have to face ourselves face to face and then we say nevertheless not my will but thine be done and there appeared an angel unto him from Heaven strengthening him the angel didn't come until he surrendered not my will but thine be done all man all God at the same time so he showed us this is what happens when you're pressed to the point of breaking this is what happens when you go through this difficult thing and we and you're being pushed upon this is how you will feel but he says this is how you conquer God never leaves you in that position God doesn't ever leave you weeping by the tomb God reveals his self to you what is God his will in your life and when you face the will of God when you face the will of God you were ready to accept it because he brings you pulls you pushes you leads you but you still have to say nevertheless not my will but thine be done and as soon as you do as soon as you do the angel appears and begins to minister unto you what is an angel is an angel is a messenger begins to bring you read a scripture and God speaks to your heart strengthening him and being in an Agony he prayed more earnestly and his sweat was as it were great drops of blood falling to the ground in the message the breach between the seven Church ages and the Seven Seals but the Browns talk he's preaching about John and John sees and John sees that there's nobody worthy to open the book and and and that's a that's another sermon for another time I would have wanted to take this point in time and we look at John and we see John who who says he he falls and he begins to weep he just like Mary at the tomb and he sees there's no way for the word of God there's no way for the book to be taken where it's hopeless for all of us that hopelessness is is that we can have no relationship with God so John begins to weep Trump begins to cry and he's in this position of this pressing and it says and he says don't be broken-hearted John don't weep for the line of the tribe of Judah the root and Offspring from David he has prevailed now that same thing is true in you in our lives because the same word that prevailed and open the book is the same word that prevails and opens you Prevail means wrestle with and overcome wrestle with and overcome oh my The Garden of Gethsemane when blood dropped down out of his face he was overcoming when blood dropped down out of his face he was overcoming say no he was under too much pressure no The Lion and the root of David has prevailed has overcome now we'll pause there I won't read the rest of the quote we'll come back to it we read we read the story of Jacob my title tonight it to remind you is so we wrestle in Genesis 25 27-28 says and the boys grew and Esau was a cunning Hunter and a man of the field and Jacob was a plain man dwelling in tents and Isaac loved Esau because he did eat of his venison but Rebecca loved Jacob Jacob this is the beginning of the story of Jacob and we see here we look we look between the lines and we begin to Desert because Jacob was a man like you and I no nothing special yet everything special here's Jacob never could be as good as Esau no good job Jacob but Esau Rebecca love Jacob but Jacob was never good enough for Dad never strong enough never good enough on the field never good enough hunting never good enough for this because Jesus was the one so here's Jacob this is the start of his life and now Jacob because he was Jacob means supplanter or Deceiver Jacob meets Esau coming off the field hunting right Jacob and Esau are always at each other's throats jealousy from Jacob and I don't know what for Misa and the Bible says Jacob have a love and Esau have I hated we use that and we and if we're not careful we'll use that scripture and we dismiss the humanity we dismiss the pain that the hardship that Esau and Jacob both went through we dismissed that oh Jacob you know was a deceiver and then he wrestled with God and it's just a story that we talk about but it's we got to make that real to nape to today tonight because we wrestle just like Jacob so this is our example we see Jacob I mean what the deceiver Jacob says swear to me this day and he swears unto him and he sold his Birthright unto Jacob Jacob deceived Esau says you want someone with his pottage here no smell it just smell it give me the birthright Jacob could never get away from the birthright you see his heart was in the right place but his flesh was in control his heart was in the right place but his flesh was in control brother Branham talks about in God trying to go to service without it being the will of God he says the bringing the ark back to Jerusalem or whatever it was bringing that Ark back was an honorable and a pure desire but David did it wrong it wasn't God's will for That season the will of God was for Eliezer to get Rebecca and to tell her that's Isaac but the will of God changed seasons because the will of God is seasonal sometimes it's the will of God for you to be a certain place then that changes and God says now it's time to go here those are called transitions those are called corners and brother Benham says there's always trouble at the corner if you think about a group of of men say in the Army and they're marching and they say you know whatever they say about left or whatever and there's eight guys marching and they say the guy in the lead says left go left at one point in time there's four guys going this way and four guys going this way and the guys going this way I said wow man they didn't catch the corner but if that guy at the very back turned when the front guy did he'd be completely out of the will of God he has to turn when he comes to the corner and it's our job to keep marching to Pace to the will of God for the season we're in because maybe the guy behind us is not at the corner yet because if you paused it there'd be one guy this way and one guy right here right at the corner but still going if this guy going this way looks at him and begins to judge him and say oh he's going the wrong way that guy can't turn then he's got to wait his turn God's will is seasonal it wasn't God's will for David to do what he did but then David learned a very very important lesson and David's again his brother says he never consulted God he consulted the priest he consulted the mighty man he consulted the people but he never consulted God and we want to be always aware especially always aware but especially in transitions in their lives we begin to see what we're doing just because we can do something doesn't mean we should just because David could get an auction cart and oxide never bore a burden oh it was spiritual doesn't mean he should and because he did he cost us life and brother says that's what happens when men take the word of God into their own hands he said they spiritually kill the people the same thing happens in your life when you say I'm gonna turn and you turn too soon you begin to die spiritually but then David goes back and says hey we need the Levites we need them to Bear the Earth because that's the way and you just read the stories both stories you see you can just tell by reading that David is a different person for for a for a season amen well so Jacob Heart in the right place flesh and control he steals the blessing and uh but all the while all along what does the Bible says the footsteps of the righteous are ordered of the Lord all along God was still in control amen now Isaac calls Esau and he says hey take your weapons and your quiver and your bow and go out into the field and get me some venison because I'm getting old and it's time to bless you Rebecca hears in the tent he she hears Isaac tell Esau this and she quickly goes to Jacob and she says I heard your father speak unto Esau she's so she said quick go get a lamb kill it I'll prepare it take the Lamb's fleece put it on you so you'll be hairy like Esau and Jacob goes into Esau and he says I am Esau thy firstborn I have done according as thou badest me arise I pray thee sit and eat of my venison that thy soul may bless me deceiving and then came to pass as soon as Isaac had made an end of blessing Jacob and Jacob was yet scarce gone out from the presence of Isaac his father Esau comes into camp what a way to just really strengthen your relationship with Esau his heart was in the right place but his flesh was in control and so he has to run away and Rebecca says now therefore my son obey my voice arise flee doubt to Laban my brother to Heron then Isaac before Jacob goes Isaac sends him away and he says go to Laban and Jacob's on this journey running and you and the fear building in his heart because Esau said I'm going to kill him if it's the last thing I do I'm gonna kill that boy and so Jacob goes and he now Jacob's running oh he was high and mighty you see God what God does God sometimes has to work layers off of our lives have to work layers off of our expectations till we can come face to face oh Jacob meets God and and he says he wakes out of his sleep and he says surely the Lord is in this place I'm going to call it Bethel but that didn't change him he met God oh it was a spiritual time he's running across the desert he's in a moment but then he gets to labor and he begins to deceive because who we are and what we are has to be done away with but God sometimes has to work in stages God has to sometimes take one layer off and then the next one and then the next one because why he's building the pressure he's preparing you so he meets Rachel and he kisses Rachel and he lifts up his voice and he wept this is the one Layman what do you want me to do for Rachel I'll serve me seven years now Jacob right wow he's he's got it all he's he he's in the land and he sells way far away his problems are buried in his past so you wonder where where western novels got their ideas from Jacob went into the to West and left his troubles in the east the man has been trying to do that since the dawn of time but there's a funny thing about triples they always catch back up so now Jacob is in is serving for Laban but Jacob has met his match oh God will bring somebody in your life who's your match somebody who points you to your Humanity somebody who brings you face to face with yourself and you look and you that's exactly what I do now I know how it feels what is God doing taking another layer off of Jacob so what does Jacob do surrender no came to pass in the morning behold It was Leah not Rachel and he goes stormy into Layman's house what have you done I served you for Rachel why have you beguiled me he says hey just just fulfill her week and I'll give you Rachel you work another seven years so Jacob says fine that's fine so then Jacob says hey seven years pass he says I need some cattle tell you what you give me I'll take all the ones with blemishes Mark string strength Rings whatever straight I think it is spotted I'll take him and so then Jacob deceives Laban now they're back and forth they're back and forth I mean Thanksgiving was awkward because Laban and Jacob would something would be brought up and but what it was what was it sometimes you know the science will tell you something there's a thing that in someone else that bothers you the most is your worst weakness your biggest weakness it's God putting you face to face with yourself and when you look at yourself face to face and then all you can do as a child of God because I'm not talking about the others I'm talking about the child of God because the child of God has a desire to change a desire to change that outweighs the pain it takes to drink that cup he looks at you you look at yourself face to face and you wrestle you wrestle you go and you pray and you say you just you pray to God and you and and you sometimes you're praying and he says no no you got it all wrong you misunderstand this is how it is but you pour your heart out to God he said I don't understand why it's like this what are you doing you're wrestling it out with God there are transitions when you come to a transition in your life you have to wrestle it out with God you have to say God was your will and he wants to see you press he wants to see you persevere he wants to put you under pressure he wants to leave his mark on you he wants you to know he had to put brother Branham through that in South Africa because he needed brother random to be totally completely sold out 110 percent and God saw a little part of brother Branham I was willing to go with the crowd so he pressed him and then God brought the word then God the sunset Mountain and all of that happened then God bought the word God sees you all you say they snuck they they they they took people to to pretend to be disciples to deceive Jesus God sees right through your mask I don't see through your mask but God does when you sit in church and you smile and Nod like you got it all under control God sees through your mask I can't God knows exactly what to do to bring you face to face with your Humanity the cattle were feeble he put them not in with the stripped bark the the trees that had the bark strip from them and the feebler were labans and the stronger were Jacobs Funny Thing Happened Jacob beheld the confidence of Labor and behold it was not toward him as before he began to realize that Laban wasn't very happy because you looked at the two herds and it was obvious Jacobs was Stronger and Laban and and uh so Jacob stole away unawares to Layman the Syrian in that he told him not that he fled Jacob's running again this time he's older he's got wives children cattle but he's running again what his problems came back only it has a different name instead of Esau it's Laban but you see what happened Jacob was in a position we we call a pickle he had Laban on that side and Esau on that side why because God said I'll let not let my son remain in this condition now in Jacob's condition he needed if we could say this the Holy Ghost but what if you have the Holy Ghost but it's time for you to step higher so he puts you between a Laban and an Esau and now all you can do all you can do you can't go to somebody for an answer you can't go to somebody for an answer all you can do is wrestle it out with God there are positions like that sometimes we come to you can get a word of encouragement but there's certain things we go through words you and God and you have to wrestle it out what God did was he left Jacob no other option why because he loves you so he leaves you no other option so we wrestle but you see the will of God is enduring it's seasonal and it's enduring God says it doesn't matter the world says wow what a mess God said it doesn't matter I'll endure Islander because I know they'll come I know when they get to that position because the world looks on and the record says Jacob's a mess Jacob has ruined it but God says now I have an appointment with Jacob God says no I can see Jacob's heart and I know exactly what he needs he say oh I wish things were different I wish I was like that person I wish I was this you know I got on the car the other day and I heard a denominational preacher on the radio and he tore my height off God can use things sometimes right on time I came in mid-sermon and he said the children of Israel were walking to the desert their shoes weren't new but they didn't need to be replaced their clothes were old but they were in perfect condition they had nothing but they lacked nothing and I thought okay God you never lack anything you never lack anything oh it was Manna again but you weren't going hungry it was quail again how many ways can mom cook quail you know there was there was uh things on people's news feeds you know 101 ways to cook quail life hack he didn't know about manna but they lacked nothing sometimes we say oh whoa it's me and you're sinning in a perfect position you lack nothing God promised he would never ever ever leave you or forsake you has he we look and we look at Jacob in between Laban and Esau we look at ourselves in between Laban and Esau we say God forsaken me Jacob said God you have a promise please keep it but then Jacob still tried Jacob still did his thing see God was pulling Jacob God was leading Jacob because Jacob sent you know the two people the two bands but the bands and then he takes his family and he and he sends them in phases and and then he takes all these girls excuse me takes his family and he sends all these gifts and faces and then he sends his family and then he's alone Genesis 32 says in verse 23 and he took them and sent them over the brook and sent over that he had and Jacob was left alone there's a semicolon there in other words there's a space of time there's a space of time the punctuation the Bible is perfect it's God's word there was a space of time Jacob was left alone when you see God was giving Jacob no other option we will scratch and scramble till we're down to no options and then we say we're all alone and God says now that you're alone I'll come talk to you but Jacob had to have the pressure build Jacob was not ready to meet God face to face Jacob had met his Humanity face to face and realized his weakness he realized his weakness and so he's trying to beg Esau for mercy and so God says Jacob's ready and Jacob was left alone and there Wrestled a man with him until the breaking of the day in other words they wrestled all night long sometimes we have to wrestle all year long sometimes longer than that wrestle wrestling Jacob wrestling what was he wrestling with he knew what he had a hold of he knew what he had to hold of he was now face to face with God and he held on tight he said God I can't do this alone when Jacob says I'm not letting you go till I get a blessing Tigger wasn't talking about just a feel-good thing Jacob wanted overcoming power Jacob was in the position he was because of what he had done and he did not want to be in control anymore so he held on to the Angel sometimes a lot of times we just have to wrestle it out we come to a corner we can't see the corner yet God's Building it in our life a transition that's what the trouble is why is there trouble there because God's Will has Departed the other direction and he doesn't want you outside of his will so you come to that transition you come to that corner and everything's falling apart nothing's working as well as it used to and what do we do in our Humanity we force it get a bigger hammer so we force it but God says no no my will changed I'm over here now so he stirs up the trouble he stirs up the trouble in our life in the church he stirs up the trouble and then we come face to face and we say oh God's this way the Unseen path the Unseen path we haven't walked that way before we have not you have not gone this way before Israel so follow the ark follow the word amen when the word steps into the water then the path was seen because the word reveals the path it's only unseen there's portions of the path for us that are unseen but the path we need today is not don't get stuck trying to figure out the future walk the path you can see don't worry about this is a very carnal example but and not to say one person is better than the other so I won't even say who's who I'll just have two people one person you just tell them you know just drive down the road you'll see it on your right okay the person says no no no no I need the map and how many feet how many miles two miles three miles you'll just see a big rock and it's got like this weird little thing to it the other person says sweet I got it I'll turn right there okay and they'll just drive and drive and drive and drive never fearing never worrying until they see the rock with the funny little thing on it but other people say no I need the map I need to I need to know what's out there God wants us to what was that other person doing driving by faith God wants us to walk the path by faith we don't need to see what is on that chair we don't need to see what's sinning the opportunity sitting on that chair we don't need to see it yet because we're not there we don't need to see the opportunity that God has for us up there in the Unseen path because we're not there yet as soon as we need to see it we'll see a sign that says turn right here God brought Jacob to this position but Jacob God brought Jacob to this position but Jacob still had to wrestle still had to have sleepless nights still had to have burdens he couldn't Express still had to have frustrations he couldn't handle but he still had to do one thing just keep going back to God and wrestling it out just keep going back to God and wrestling it out Lord what is your will please lead me to it there's always trouble at the corner there's trouble at Jacob's corner and he said he says well what do you want oh he's wrestling it out it's dark you know when it's you ever tried to walk in the dark you're trippy it twist your it just it's a pain wrestling in the dark you know boom I didn't know that tree was there and the angel says the light's coming I gotta go what do you want and he says I want the blessing so the angel says thy name shall be called No More Jacob but Israel for as a prince hast thou power with God and with me with men and Hast prevailed then Jacob walked different he wrestled with the eight you wrestled with the word of God God gave you the Holy Ghost you walked different but then you come to times in your life where God says it's time for you to come higher up wrestle with me wrestle with me wrestle with you what you can't see Jacob couldn't see what he was wrestling with he could feel it though he could feel it and then God said you now have the power you have prevailed the rest of that quote he says The Lion and the root of David has prevailed has overcome he says like Jacob being sir planter and when he got in contact with the angel he held on and the angel tried to pull away and he said why are the Angels trying to pull away was God trying to abandon Jacob no God was pressing Jacob again Jacob's wrestling with the angel and God says no there's still a part of you there's still some of you left and so he tried to get away and then Jacob said whatever it takes I'm staying here that might not be a literal physical location that might be a spiritual location he said God I'm just going to keep praying God I'm going to keep praying because we have lives we have to work we have to get up in the morning we've got to take care of the kids we gotta we gotta come to church we gotta do our duties at the church take care of the church do all these things but we keep praying amen we keep we stay in that position we position we say God I I haven't forgotten I haven't forgotten God please show me Lord okay okay Lord I don't I don't need to know what's the opportunity on that chair I don't I don't need to know God just show me the next step because I'm standing here and the light is Illuminating a path that has ended where do I go and then he swings the light and you say oh the path turned the corner if you just barge on the light stops back there and you fall off the cliff because you're walking a path you have not walked before at every point in your life every day you get up it might be the same thing again but it's a path you haven't walked before you say God what's your will today what is God's will for today his word for today his word will show you because his word is a light Thy word is a lamp unto my feet and a light unto my path you'll never catch the corner unless you stay consecrated to God so start there first start there first when you come to the corner don't be so quick to say wow the devil is really fighting this stop and check yourself make sure it might be god pushing you like he did Jacob Jacob said Jacob was mad at leaving because Laban comes after him says you stole my God you took my kids everything I don't even say goodbye you took and then he can't find the gods because his wife is sitting on them and then Jacob gets really upset how dare you right I'm you know I have nothing but troubles from you Jacob was just as much to blame as leaving was but Jacob overcame and you and I will overcome one last example here first Samuel 16 verse 11 to 13 can turn or write it down and Samuel said unto Jesse I hear all thy children and he said There remaineth Yet the youngest and behold he keepeth the Sheep and Samuel said unto Jesse's sin and fetch him for we will not sit down till he come hither that's a polite way of saying do what I told you to do and he sent and brought him in and now he was ready and with all of a beautiful countenance and goodly to look to in other words he didn't look very rugged he didn't look like a king and the Lord said arise anoint him for this is he over and over again in the Bible God uses men who we don't expect why because he wants you to look to him not them that's right he doesn't want you to look at me he wants you to look at him and Samuel took and he sent and brought him in and he okay and the Lord said arise anoint him for this is he Samuel let me just I want to make sure I get my facts straight real fast let me turn to First Samuel my Bible here first Samuel chapter 16. so the first the first one comes in 16 Verse 6 came to pass when they overcome that he looked on eliab and said surely the Lord's anointed is before him but the Lord said unto Samuel look on his countenance are on the height of his statue because I have refused him for the Lord seeth not as a man seeth for man looketh on the outward appearance but the Lord looketh on the heart and then he he goes to abinadab and it doesn't say God spoke to Samuel because God already said it God doesn't repeat himself he says it he gives you the word and then he wants to see he wants to see you walk by it tell Samuel don't look on the countenance and then the Lord goes quiet I've been in that comes and then the next one comes the next one comes and Samuel Now isn't going off how he feels he's going off the word saying is this is this The Wanted God's not audibly speaking to him but Samuel's looking basing off the word say no not this guy no not this guy then he comes to David and then he says arise anoint him for this is he then Samuel took the Horn of oil and anointed him in the midst of his Brethren and the spirit of the Lord Came Upon David from that day forward so Samuel rose up and went to Rhema the spirit of the Lord came on David from that point forward now came to pass when evil spirit from God was upon Saul that David took and harp and played with his hand to so Saul was refreshed and was well in the evil spirit departed from him David man wow what a position he's an aide to the king he helps the king he's anointed by Samuel anointed by God through Samuel he's helping the king first Samuel 17 51 the battle with Goliath therefore David ran and stood upon the Philistine and took his sword and Drew it out of the sheath thereof and slew him and cut off his head there with and when the Philistine saw the champion was dead they fled another great High moment David a hero the anointed hero Saul took him that day and would let him go no more home to his father's house full-time employee top of the food chain right next to the king it's Jonathan's his buddy I mean son of the king Jonathan wow that's my best friend he was name dropping he said yeah Jonathan my best friend yeah Jonathan is my best friend David lifted up everything's going well he's right there at the king he said okay one day the king's gonna get old and die and he's gonna say I hand my scepter off to you David and David went out with this River Saul sent him and behaved himself wisely and Saul sent him over the men of War promotion and he was accepted in the sight of all the people and also in the sight of Soul servants lifted up in the church high up in the church looked upon looked up to in the church then it all changed Saul cast the javelin for he said I will Smite David even to the wall with it and David avoided out of his presence twice what in a moment's time everything for David changed what was God doing God said no no you're not ready yet you're not ready yet why bring David to that position and then have Saul through a javelin at him why not start there because God loves to bring you up he says and that vase doesn't look right and smash the clay back down why because in that smashing characters built David was a good man after God's heart but their character was not yet so that he could rule the kingdom so God smashed him back down by Brother Saul throwing a javelin at him brother Saul throwing a javelin at him not denominational Saul brother Saul what's going on Saul was yet the more afraid of David and Saul became David's enemy continually I'm just hopping these scriptures here to tell the story once looked up to like another father Jonathan his best friend everything's going well then Saul hates his guts forgive me if that was a little bit crude Saul can't stand him so he throws a javelin twice and Saul speak to Jonathan his son and to all his servants that they would kill David the hell Council David was gone probably off doing the king's business wise in his countenance and so it has a meeting and how we're going to bring David down even telling Jonathan his best friend kids kill David now for a third time Saul sought to Smite David even to the wall with the javelin but He Slipped Away out of Saul's presence and he smoked the javelin into the wall and David fled and escaped that night now David is running what what what why did Saul have to throw the javelin again because David wasn't running yet God said David I need you running I need you running David Saul throw the javelin again a third time Peter denied the Lord three times a third time he throws a javelin what everything's falling apart for David no it's not none of these men in David's life were outside of the church they were here throws the gentleman against Saul David runs and now now David has still has Jonathan and Jonathan says look I'll go talk to Dad and I'll shoot the arrows and you can go with the story at home and you know if I tell the boy run and get the arrows so on and so forth and David fled from neoff in Raymond came and said before Jonathan what have I done Lord what did I do what is wrong thing David nothing and I say to you tonight nothing is wrong you're just 20 degrees from perfect pressure because God never misses a shot what have I done what is mine iniquity and what is my sin before thy father that he seeketh my life they had no reasons they had no reasons to kill Jesus they had to make things up Mana Belial hair to that see no fault in this man we can take the types of David another sermon as soon as the lad was gone David arose out of a place toward the South fell on his face to the ground and bound himself three times and they kissed one another Jonathan him and Jonathan and wept one with another until David exceeded the word exceeded there means until David composed himself he says okay this is where we are this is what's happening I don't understand it but I know God's in control and David runs David runs and he runs and he runs and he runs and he's in the cave and then and then he's he's in the Philistines camp then his family gets attacked and he's constantly told go ahead take Saul's Life by brother abishad go ahead take Saul all your troubles will be over just kill him and David says no because why it was not yet God's season for David to be king you say but that's a pure and an honorable thing to to get rid of Saul the man who's causing Israel all of these troubles go ahead you know nobody will everybody will thank you go ahead run him through you see you see why there's trouble at the corner because it's all good both ways but only one way is God's will only one way is God's season only one way what was God's will is not God's will today amen for a time it was Eliza Rebecca and Isaac Eliza's pointing saying that's Isaac Rebecca's running off the camel for a moment in time it was God's will a god season but then Eliezer left God made a transition now the same thing in you and I there's a point in time where we come to a transition where God calls us to go running from what what was God doing stripping David down tell it was just David all alone see well he was surrounded by men yeah men who said kill Saul and then men who were ready to kill David because the stuff and the women were gone David all alone Time After Time After Time God stripped David down to nothing took him to a position of nothing and so we wrestle and wrestle and wrestle but the will of God is enduring the will of God is enduring and God gives us the strength to again get up in that Dusty crummy old cave and say maybe today's the day but not my will thine will be done because one day will be the day you see the corner then then but until then you keep wrestling and don't worry God's will will endure amen until you're in the position God wants you to be amen that's powerheads Heavenly Father Lord Jesus it's no easy thing to come face to face with ourselves Lord it's no easy thing to have to wrestle wrestle these things out with you Lord but father you give us the strength to do so you stripped David down but you never left him he stripped Jacob down but you never left him you were there you were always there and you're always here every day we go you're here every day we we walk we get up you're here Lord I pray you just guide us and lead us father Lord as a church help us Lord lead us guide us bring us higher up Lord as individuals as your people bring us higher up they're the only way to go higher is to lose another part of ourselves to lay down another part to surrender another portion of ourselves that's the only way for us to step higher up the angel came and ministered unto him after he surrendered and brought him higher up God help us Lord Jesus Lord we all pray we have the desire to to know you more but that means to know ourselves less help us Lord to lay our Humanity down help me Lord to lay my Humanity down the discrepancies that you have caused
