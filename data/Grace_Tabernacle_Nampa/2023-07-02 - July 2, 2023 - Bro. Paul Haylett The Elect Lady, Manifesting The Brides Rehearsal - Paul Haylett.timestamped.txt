[31:51] sitting here with just a hope for
[31:54] something of the future but we are here
[31:57] today having our Lord Jesus Christ
[32:00] present in our lives amen amen breathe
[32:04] Elijah sister Rachel God bless you and
[32:07] welcome Amen brother Elijah I hope you
[32:10] live up to all the boasting they have
[32:12] done about you
[32:13] I don't know are you guys still on your
[32:15] honeymoon
[32:16] [Laughter]
[32:19] oh Rachel you cynical little girl you
[32:23] oh brother Tim God bless you your
[32:26] birthday
[32:27] as we've already announced our brother
[32:29] Jose Lord willing will be next Sunday I
[32:32] wanted him to I invited him for this
[32:34] Sunday here but uh just some
[32:37] circumstances come up and he felt the
[32:39] need to put that off so uh we just asked
[32:44] him to come this next Sunday share
[32:46] always enjoy brother Jose just a fresh
[32:49] perspective of the word amen and
[32:54] um we want to remember also this evening
[32:57] kind of sprung it on all of you but if
[32:59] we're not careful sometimes things just
[33:01] get carried out further further further
[33:03] so definitely was on my heart to have a
[33:05] bible study this evening and for those
[33:08] of you who like to do a little research
[33:09] the topic will be on forgiveness
[33:13] uh the covering of the blood blood of
[33:16] bulls and goats amen so you can look
[33:18] into that this was brought to me by a
[33:21] brother
[33:22] who had a question mark over this he's
[33:25] not from the church here
[33:27] and we just discussed this and it really
[33:30] was strong upon my heart uh for us just
[33:32] to dig into that amen and obviously I
[33:36] think everyone knows that the Fourth of
[33:38] July brother Trevor sister Kerry would
[33:40] like to host every one of you at their
[33:43] house amen you might coordinate to maybe
[33:46] bring something to help a little bit
[33:49] um amen I didn't know about brother
[33:52] Chris certainly sounds like the devil
[33:54] didn't want him to drive to Sandpoint
[33:56] but uh God is good amen and remember
[34:00] brother Trevor's sister Carrie this
[34:02] morning the devil anointed their dog to
[34:04] eat the whole bone and so they had to
[34:07] take their dog to the vet
[34:09] and he is a cute little guy so certainly
[34:12] wouldn't want something to happen there
[34:15] we need to pray for the believer's work
[34:17] situations now when I say that it's all
[34:21] not dire but I'll just be bold our
[34:23] brother vasili you know has some desires
[34:27] but this company is working for uh kind
[34:30] of a little bit Taskmaster and uh we
[34:33] just want God to come on the scene and
[34:35] anoint that our sister April while she
[34:39] is a very busy sister but yet her job
[34:42] has a very hectic schedule attached to
[34:45] it if you have too much work or a lack
[34:47] of work God's still in control amen and
[34:50] so we want to just lift those things
[34:52] back up and so we just want to do that
[34:57] remember we forgot our brother Alex I
[34:59] don't know how we did that but brother
[35:01] Alex
[35:02] um with his new job uh they asked him to
[35:04] go out of town to meet some new
[35:07] employees so they could all kind of
[35:09] coordinate together he'll be home this
[35:12] evening and it shouldn't happen too
[35:14] often but he he uh just felt like that
[35:18] you know this was something they desired
[35:21] in and uh it sounds like it'll be a good
[35:24] job for him let's turn in our Bibles uh
[35:26] thank you musicians Amen brother Isaac
[35:30] amen I want to speak to you once again
[35:33] on things that are to be because see the
[35:35] word speaks to us and says that certain
[35:37] things are going to happen before the
[35:39] coming of the Lord before a Rapture
[35:41] takes place and and we look at that and
[35:44] realize my brother and sister for all
[35:46] that we see in the world today all the
[35:50] things that are negative and we say oh
[35:52] my how can Humanity go there but if
[35:55] you'll just stop and you will look at it
[35:57] carefully you'll see that it's nothing
[35:59] more than Satan's counterbalance that
[36:01] he's trying to put in place to counter
[36:04] what God is doing with the elect lady
[36:06] amen so when you see as I've spoke to
[36:09] you before we we tend to pull back from
[36:12] what seems to be the world's vocabulary
[36:14] their their words but my brother and
[36:16] sister the bride is awakened
[36:20] and Satan come along and says I need to
[36:22] wakeen up my people too and so as he
[36:24] wakes up his people we focus if we're
[36:27] not careful on the woke movement but my
[36:30] brother and sister there's a bride
[36:31] that's been woke up amen she's come out
[36:33] of a stupor amen the scripture tells us
[36:36] how that they were there and even at the
[36:39] coming of the Lord at that time they
[36:41] slumbered and slept so God's got an
[36:43] Awakening for the bride of Christ amen
[36:46] and I say thank you Lord that you're
[36:48] waking us up amen that we will not be
[36:50] those that are asleep it is coming and
[36:53] so we look at these things and realize
[36:56] how blessed we are that what God is
[36:58] doing in our life and so I want to speak
[37:01] to you this morning I I wrote down so
[37:03] many titles that this is the one that
[37:06] finally floated to the surface the elect
[37:08] lady manifesting the bride's rehearsal
[37:12] and we take this thought out and it will
[37:15] be actually the very last thing we close
[37:18] this service out with but you'll see
[37:20] what the prophet of God is talking about
[37:22] there and you'll be able to look back
[37:24] and see where brother Paul was at let's
[37:26] turn in our Bibles this morning and I
[37:28] just want to say it is good to be in the
[37:29] house of God it is good to be here to
[37:32] look out upon your faces ones that we
[37:35] love and just know that when we get to
[37:39] the other side we're going to look over
[37:40] and we're going to be so filled with joy
[37:43] to know that these are the ones got
[37:46] called us to serve with called us to
[37:48] reinforce to cover each other's back and
[37:51] and I think that's wonderful amen acts
[37:54] the 14th chapter just uh two verses I
[37:57] think will help us lay the foundation of
[38:00] our thought today acts 14 and 27. now if
[38:05] you look back up in the book of Acts
[38:07] you'll find that uh they were in such a
[38:11] tizzy over the truth being preached they
[38:14] stoned Paul and they drag him out of the
[38:17] city believing he's dead and it says
[38:19] that the Believers amen the disciples
[38:22] they were there standing round about now
[38:25] my brother and sister God did not call
[38:27] them for an armed Revolt no doubt there
[38:30] could have overpowered those that were
[38:32] stoning but God didn't call that because
[38:35] you see there is a great host of
[38:36] witnesses and just as today you will can
[38:40] be rest assured that there are countries
[38:42] China being an example where the Saints
[38:45] are actively
[38:46] persecuted and thrown in jail for what
[38:49] they believe but yet we enjoy a liberty
[38:51] amen so it's not to rise up in a
[38:54] physical sense but it's for the word to
[38:57] reinforce the hearts of this body of
[39:00] Believers which is not just Grace
[39:02] Tabernacle it's a bride of Christ and
[39:04] every portion of the body is
[39:07] contributing its portion to the economy
[39:10] of God and so we get to enjoy some
[39:12] Freedom we don't know what the future
[39:14] holds but I Know Who Holds my future I
[39:17] know who holds your future amen and when
[39:20] they were come and had gathered the
[39:22] church together
[39:24] they rehearsed all that God had done
[39:27] with them and how he had opened the door
[39:30] of Faith unto the Gentiles and there
[39:33] they Abode long time with the disciples
[39:37] Heavenly Father we ask you Lord Jesus
[39:39] this morning just to bless your word
[39:42] father just help us Lord to speak it out
[39:45] father in a fashion that's pleasing to
[39:47] you and a benefit to your people we ask
[39:50] father for every spoken and unspoken
[39:53] need father that you would just come and
[39:56] touch lives change lives draw us closer
[39:58] to you Lord I pray in the name of Jesus
[40:01] Christ
[40:02] amen you may be seated
[40:11] as we look in the thought today my
[40:14] brother and sister we'll see the Lord is
[40:16] always working behind the scenes and I
[40:20] asked sister Ruth for permission to
[40:23] bring this as an example but sister Ruth
[40:26] here a few days ago shared with us a
[40:29] lovely testimony how that for years
[40:32] there have been certain things that had
[40:34] bothered her life and how God has come
[40:36] now my brother and sister was not an
[40:38] overnight miracle as it were that took
[40:41] place but nonetheless the fact that
[40:43] Satan would want to afflict or to bind
[40:46] it is a miracle without a doubt amen but
[40:50] yet God is working behind the scenes
[40:52] just slowly changing our circumstance
[40:55] bringing about the promise of his word
[40:57] and it that's where it all lies my
[40:59] brother and sister it's not what you and
[41:01] I can do it's not how strong we are or
[41:04] what we can articulate but it's God
[41:07] working through us and if God works
[41:10] instantaneously as what we would call a
[41:13] miracle my brother and sister so be it
[41:15] we believe in miracles we desire
[41:17] Miracles but if God chooses to take you
[41:20] and I on the long path as we look at the
[41:23] book of Pilgrims Progress you know there
[41:25] was all kinds of paths that were out
[41:27] there and he didn't call each and every
[41:29] one to the same path some Take the Long
[41:32] Road amen and if God chooses to take you
[41:34] and I on the long road nonetheless it's
[41:37] God who takes us amen and so we
[41:40] appreciate God working behind the scenes
[41:43] many times changing our circumstances
[41:46] now as we sit here this morning is there
[41:49] needs in this body yes there are but I
[41:52] tell you my brother and sister sometimes
[41:54] we need those needs amen theirs where
[41:57] the molding takes place there were the
[41:59] character is formed it's in those needs
[42:02] or times of adversity that we actually
[42:05] become mature Christians amen if it was
[42:08] all just smooth imagine what we would be
[42:10] now you you see sometimes in the great
[42:13] storms that come in this last few weeks
[42:16] we just had some pretty good storms
[42:18] coming as you go through the countryside
[42:20] through the neighborhood you'll see
[42:22] trees my brother and sister that blew
[42:24] over and you'll realize they had no deep
[42:27] root they literally tear up half of the
[42:29] yard but all of the roots are just right
[42:32] there at the surface that's not the kind
[42:34] of Christian that will survive laodicea
[42:37] God wants to shake you and I and root us
[42:40] right down into the very Rock because
[42:43] it's in the rock that when this storm
[42:45] comes we are there and we can then
[42:48] determine as it is I will stand amen can
[42:53] we say that together I will stand amen
[42:56] so it's there that we make up our mind
[42:58] you say well if I'm the seed of God then
[43:01] then I will endure my brother and sister
[43:03] the seed has a manifestation the seed
[43:06] has to bring forth of its own kind so we
[43:09] can't just say if I'm seed if I'm seed
[43:11] we have to demonstrate that we are seed
[43:14] and when God comes and starts to move in
[43:16] our life the demonstration or
[43:18] manifestation of this starts to come to
[43:21] pass amen and so I want to explain the
[43:23] thought behind my title today as I have
[43:26] read to you the scripture of the elect
[43:28] lady how she's found standing in truth
[43:31] now my brother and sister this elect
[43:33] lady just didn't happen she didn't wake
[43:35] up one morning and she's just the elect
[43:38] lady she's just not uh brought from
[43:41] nothing into a complete work but this
[43:45] elect lady started out if I could bring
[43:47] it in this context she started out as a
[43:49] young girl she started out as an
[43:51] immature and as God is moving my brother
[43:55] and sister many people would say well uh
[43:58] we wonder about the message I hear this
[44:00] from people I wonder about the message
[44:02] there's this doesn't seem to be any
[44:04] difference between us and the rest of
[44:06] the world well my brother and sister if
[44:08] you're looking at the message as just a
[44:10] church that you you attend there is
[44:13] nothing different than the rest of the
[44:15] world but if you are looking at it that
[44:18] regardless of what is happening around
[44:19] us God has got a chosen people
[44:22] predestination being manifested coming
[44:25] to life and so what is that that's when
[44:28] the roots get below the surface amen
[44:30] that's when they get down and take a
[44:32] horse of something and some people say
[44:34] well you know we come out of the
[44:35] Methodist Church well we could go back
[44:38] and just be methodists it wouldn't be
[44:39] much different you go back and you'll
[44:41] find out you're going to be one of the
[44:43] most miserable people on Earth amen if
[44:45] you are the bride of Christ if you are
[44:47] predestinated you can't live in that
[44:50] environment amen so some have tried it
[44:53] and praise God they come back and some
[44:55] are still coming but we claim them in
[44:58] the name of Jesus Christ amen and so as
[45:01] this is moving forward we see that God
[45:04] had to do something in such a fashion
[45:07] that God chooses amen he's the one that
[45:09] chooses the way that he desires to work
[45:11] and so as we see this we see the Apostle
[45:15] Paul now recorded in the book of Acts
[45:17] now remember the prophet said that we
[45:20] would be if there was another book of
[45:22] Acts written in other words it's not
[45:25] that it's not happening I want you to
[45:27] catch this get the words right it's not
[45:29] that it's not happening if it was
[45:31] written on a page
[45:34] see people get this well no the prophet
[45:36] said and if there was a nut no it is
[45:39] happening my brother and sister it's
[45:41] just that God's not choosing to record
[45:43] it on the page because there won't be
[45:46] another generation or church age of
[45:49] Believers to need that word recorded on
[45:52] a page so God said what I've got is
[45:54] sufficient but if there was another book
[45:57] of Acts written we would see the same
[46:00] manifestation of the power of God now
[46:03] look at the Apostle Paul he's there he
[46:05] preached the word bold I'll tell you
[46:07] what I I just keep asking the Lord help
[46:10] me Lord with wisdom to be bold I don't I
[46:12] don't want to be the timid Christian I
[46:14] want to be a bold Christian but bold
[46:16] doesn't mean rude
[46:20] bold means that courage is there at the
[46:22] surface
[46:23] amen for us to stand on the word
[46:26] now Paul he preaches the word as God
[46:29] lays on his heart brings him to a place
[46:31] that we would In the Flesh think now my
[46:34] friends should be here to defend me but
[46:36] God chose because he was making Paul a
[46:39] witness amen God chose to let those
[46:42] Disciples of that day set back and watch
[46:45] Paul be stoned now my brother and sister
[46:48] in that day if you just read up a little
[46:50] of the history they didn't just throw a
[46:52] rock or two to make you feel bad hurt
[46:54] ache no they were intent on killing with
[46:58] those stones and it's just hard to
[47:00] imagine people who believe they were
[47:02] doing God's will could have such angst
[47:05] to approach it in such a fashion that if
[47:07] you're not in my church then we're going
[47:09] to Stone you but they were angry because
[47:12] the spirits were being disrupted amen
[47:15] the system
[47:17] oftentimes we look at that and say well
[47:19] this church is this and that church is
[47:21] this my brother and sister just
[47:22] recognize its Spirits it's the spirits
[47:25] that don't like to be disturbed amen so
[47:28] as it is Paul is stoned and they must
[47:31] have just beaten him bloody with these
[47:34] rocks my brother and sister and they
[47:36] drag him outside of the city believing
[47:39] they're dragging a dead body now this
[47:42] wasn't a body that would have even had
[47:44] breath in it my brother and sister they
[47:46] they didn't believe that he was still
[47:48] alive and would expire soon they thought
[47:51] they had killed him and yet the power of
[47:53] God was not finished with him and I want
[47:56] to tell you this morning that when the
[47:58] Devil comes in like a flood he cannot
[48:01] take your life he cannot defeat you till
[48:04] God is finished with you and then he
[48:07] might use death as a vehicle to take you
[48:10] into the presence of God but Satan will
[48:13] never come out the Victor amen so we
[48:16] look at this and Paul's there outside of
[48:18] the city now surrounded by those who are
[48:21] followers Believers of the gospel and
[48:24] God comes back
[48:27] the Breath of Life
[48:30] the very Life of Christ
[48:32] comes back in him and he rises up in
[48:35] just a matter of time he is traveling
[48:37] once again to preach the gospel now my
[48:40] brother and sister these are some of the
[48:42] hard afflictions that Paul refers to in
[48:45] his life amen you can't walk away from
[48:48] something like that without being
[48:50] scarred without being damaged in a
[48:52] physical element but I want you to catch
[48:55] this here in Acts 14. amen and when all
[48:59] of these things had happened they come
[49:01] together they got the whole church
[49:03] together amen that's why church is more
[49:06] than just someone preaching to you it's
[49:08] a church sharing what God is doing
[49:11] within our midst amen within our lives
[49:15] and we're seeing God as I use sister
[49:17] Ruth as a witness we're seeing God Work
[49:20] behind the scenes it's not all upfront
[49:23] Supernatural oh look at the bolt of
[49:25] lightning look at this look of that God
[49:28] is moving in our midst he's changing
[49:30] lives this morning amen and and so as
[49:33] we'll see this taking place the church
[49:36] come together and they rehearsed all
[49:38] that God had done with them not to them
[49:42] my brother and sister with them they saw
[49:45] God as their friend as their father as
[49:48] their brother as a part of the body with
[49:51] him it was not God made me do this but
[49:54] it's God anointing you and I where we
[49:56] say Lord can I do something for you amen
[49:59] can I be a part of this movement can I
[50:01] be a part of what you're doing in this
[50:03] day and so as it's there that uh what
[50:07] God had done with them and how he had
[50:10] opened the door of Faith unto the
[50:13] Gentiles now my brother and sister if we
[50:16] really just stop for a moment it's not
[50:18] too hard to comprehend how important
[50:20] that is to you and I that the door was
[50:22] opened to us as Gentiles so God chooses
[50:27] Paul's suffering
[50:30] Paul sacrifice
[50:34] complete surrender giving of himself
[50:38] to open a door
[50:40] how much more so we should be thinking
[50:42] about opening the door for those around
[50:44] us whether it's family it's friends or
[50:47] whatever it might be but to see Lord let
[50:50] me be the sacrifice let me be one Lord
[50:53] that might suffer that the door might be
[50:56] open for a brother for a sister
[50:59] can we say Amen to that
[51:01] amen and so we see now they rehearse
[51:04] this and the word rehearsed we won't get
[51:08] into all of Webster but you know there's
[51:10] a foundation of that to to prepare to
[51:13] practice or to recount something and so
[51:16] what they were doing was recounting to
[51:18] one another how that God had used the
[51:21] word amen that was brought by a brother
[51:23] brought by a man amen and it come and
[51:27] that was a door that was being opened to
[51:29] the Gentiles and I say thank you Lord
[51:31] because we're here today amen having
[51:34] walked through this door amen now we
[51:37] must look my brother and sister we must
[51:40] look at this and realize what the
[51:42] finished work of God is
[51:44] we've said this many times I believe you
[51:46] understand it uh correctly but my
[51:48] brother and sister the finished work of
[51:50] God is not a snapshot in time
[51:54] like us today
[51:57] this morning
[52:03] God's looking from the beginning
[52:06] to the end
[52:07] and he's saying hmm
[52:10] my plan
[52:13] is working perfectly
[52:15] everything's right on time
[52:19] everything's according to what I
[52:22] declared what I spoke
[52:25] actually started with a thought
[52:27] and when I spoke before the foundation
[52:29] of the world it's going according to
[52:32] plan now we can sit here and say you
[52:35] know seems like chaos is in our family
[52:36] chaos is in our nation chaos in the
[52:39] whole world my brother and sister in the
[52:41] plan of God it's going perfectly
[52:43] according to the plan amen and we ought
[52:47] to just stop and say Lord let me just
[52:50] realize that all the way back with the
[52:52] Apostle Paul you opened the door now you
[52:55] are anointing us to walk through the
[52:57] door a common phrase that we use as it
[53:00] once was death to go Beyond the Veil but
[53:03] now you have to go Beyond the Veil so
[53:06] the door of the veil of Christ amen
[53:09] which is the Holy Ghost has been opened
[53:12] to you and I that we can walk through it
[53:14] and freely receive of him that is not a
[53:18] gift as it were something in a box with
[53:20] wrapping paper on it but it was the very
[53:23] life of Jesus Christ he gave to you and
[53:26] I and my brother and sister the phrase
[53:28] we hear it a lot you know if you have
[53:31] one teaspoon of the ocean you have the
[53:33] ocean amen every element that is there
[53:36] and so when Christ said I am going to
[53:39] pour myself into you then we have every
[53:43] element of our Lord Jesus Christ that
[53:46] ought to be something to say thank you
[53:47] for amen so we can get caught up in the
[53:50] struggle of the day
[53:52] amen we look at this I know none of you
[53:55] make mistakes but it's people like you
[53:57] that make mistakes amen and as we look
[54:00] at that the devil will try to tell you
[54:03] that you know there's a problem here but
[54:05] I want you to stop and say Lord I
[54:07] recognize in the word the door was open
[54:10] to me
[54:12] can you say Amen to that the door's been
[54:14] opened to us you wouldn't be here this
[54:16] morning the world's too attractive the
[54:19] world's too beautiful the world's too
[54:21] easy my brother and sister you wouldn't
[54:23] be here today but God ordained for you
[54:26] to be here and something inside of you
[54:28] you might not be committed this morning
[54:30] but what you don't realize is God is
[54:32] pushing the seed down and watering it
[54:34] and it will come to pass that you wake
[54:36] up one day and realize I can't live
[54:39] without him amen but we get caught up in
[54:41] the struggle of the day do you ever do
[54:43] that
[54:44] get caught up in the struggle of the day
[54:46] all the other details all go out the
[54:50] window and at the end of the day you sit
[54:52] down at the supper table and say you
[54:54] know I spent all day on this thought or
[54:56] process or problem and I forgot to do
[54:59] this and I forgot to do this and I
[55:01] forgot to do this and the devil can even
[55:03] do that at the end of the day you'll
[55:05] realize you never even prayed or maybe
[55:07] you never picked up your Bible because
[55:08] you're so caught up you woke up in the
[55:10] morning I've got to go do this I've got
[55:12] to go do this how do I fix this problem
[55:14] my brother and sister the struggle of
[55:15] the day is real
[55:17] don't let anybody ever tell you just
[55:20] just ignore the devil and just go on my
[55:23] brother and sister the devil's real and
[55:25] sometimes he shows up as a water pump in
[55:28] your minivan
[55:30] amen sometimes he shows up as a problem
[55:33] you get up in the morning walk out flat
[55:35] tire I'm going to be late for work
[55:37] and then that bothers you and then the
[55:39] boss bothers you and then it bugs you
[55:41] the whole day and maybe the whole week
[55:42] and maybe the company's talking about
[55:44] laying people off and you oh will this
[55:46] be a factor and the devil anoints every
[55:48] bit of that whole chain there but my
[55:51] brother and sister when we get caught up
[55:52] in the struggle of the day the day will
[55:55] turn into a week and the week into a
[55:57] month and the month into a year and then
[55:59] we'll find that people will be talking
[56:00] about well you know a year ago I was on
[56:03] fire for God why aren't you saying today
[56:06] I'm on fire for God is because the devil
[56:09] has got in the struggle and the struggle
[56:12] has overwhelmed us and Satan keeps us
[56:15] from getting through the door into the
[56:17] presence of God because in the presence
[56:19] of God is deliverance from the struggle
[56:22] amen and so as Satan tries to anoint
[56:24] these things to bring it about my
[56:26] brother and sister I want you to realize
[56:29] today that this is all just a rehearsal
[56:34] you realize what you think is life and
[56:36] death here today is nothing more than a
[56:39] rehearsal
[56:41] amen this is not the final work this is
[56:44] not who we are if this is all we have to
[56:46] live for is to get up and work and and
[56:49] see our our children grow up amen
[56:52] because while they're growing up we're
[56:53] growing old
[56:55] amen and so you look at that it's like
[56:57] what is their excitement about that my
[56:59] brother and sister but I tell you if
[57:01] this is all there was then we don't have
[57:03] much to look forward to but this is
[57:07] nothing more than the rehearsal of what
[57:09] God Said glory is going to be you as an
[57:13] overcomer you as Victoria you with my
[57:16] presence filled with the Holy Ghost my
[57:19] very life in you and you get to live
[57:22] eternally like this and this is the
[57:24] molding of it this is the rehearsal amen
[57:27] and so you look at this and realize that
[57:29] this great finale that is coming
[57:32] now my brother and sister interesting
[57:34] how subjects come up somebody mentions
[57:37] to me the other day well what do you
[57:38] think brother Paul about a little
[57:40] movement here and the little thing
[57:42] that's happening there and some folks
[57:44] are believing that they need to just go
[57:46] and move their whole church and it
[57:48] struck me because I have kind of
[57:50] jokingly mentioned that to you before
[57:52] that if we're gonna escape this world
[57:55] and just location mattered then there
[57:58] was at that time unfortunately it sold
[58:00] it was beautiful place I mean maybe we
[58:02] should have jumped on it saint
[58:04] upper end of the Bitterroot Valley last
[58:07] Ranch on the end of it thousands tens of
[58:09] thousands of Acres we could have just
[58:11] built our own little world up there
[58:13] until we start fighting with each other
[58:17] our only place of Escape is Jesus Christ
[58:22] we can pick up and move to Montana we
[58:25] can pick up and go here we can go there
[58:27] but the devil is still there and as long
[58:30] as we think we can escape then we'll
[58:34] still take our problems with us but when
[58:37] we find that our only place of Escape is
[58:40] our Lord Jesus Christ then we can run
[58:43] into him whether we're in the mountain
[58:45] in the city in the deserts or where if
[58:48] it might be my brother and sister we
[58:50] have our place of escape and the devil
[58:53] would try to anoint us to go I need to
[58:55] go here we need to go there we need to
[58:57] get away from people you're still there
[59:04] but when we can recognize
[59:07] that God is taking us and molding and
[59:11] forming us into what he desires to be so
[59:14] he can pour the fullness
[59:16] of who he is into us now we have that in
[59:19] potential my brother and sister but
[59:21] imagine now that we as humans Brothers
[59:23] shared this with me many years ago I
[59:25] just I'm sorry it struck me at the time
[59:27] as so hilarious but the brother he said
[59:30] on a Monday morning he's going to work
[59:32] and the traffic is bad and he is
[59:35] frustrated and he's getting closer to
[59:37] being late for work and oh my look at
[59:39] these people you know it's just and he
[59:42] looks over in the car and there was his
[59:44] kid's little console thing I mean his
[59:47] kid was little you know probably uh
[59:48] Sammy or declan's age and have this
[59:51] little console had a steering wheel it
[59:52] had a horn and it had a deal and then it
[59:55] had a button over here
[59:57] um that said machine gun
[1:00:01] and he literally finds himself in
[1:00:03] traffic with this in his lap and these
[1:00:05] cars and he's like bombs
[1:00:08] boom machine guns
[1:00:11] and he was like what am I doing
[1:00:16] what am I doing
[1:00:20] because the cars were still there the
[1:00:22] people were still there and he was still
[1:00:25] there
[1:00:27] he said it did give me a moment of
[1:00:30] satisfaction
[1:00:34] but you see it's no lasting relief
[1:00:37] amen our lasting relief my brother and
[1:00:39] sisters to realize this is just the
[1:00:42] rehearsal
[1:00:45] God's going to mold you and I and bring
[1:00:48] us to this place
[1:00:50] that when we walk out of laodicea
[1:00:52] we walk out of this world
[1:00:55] well let me put it to you this way
[1:00:58] this elect lady is not going to just
[1:01:01] accidentally end up being who she is
[1:01:05] not going to be an accident that brings
[1:01:07] you and I but it's going to be a
[1:01:09] conscious decision where we stand and
[1:01:11] say the word says I believe the word I'm
[1:01:14] going to testify the word in fact I'm
[1:01:16] going to speak the word out of my own
[1:01:18] mouth I believe this Lord and I believe
[1:01:21] there's deliverance and victory in
[1:01:23] everything I need in this word so Lord
[1:01:25] I'm a Believer
[1:01:28] but if you stand there and say I don't
[1:01:30] know I hope I might I'm trying my
[1:01:34] brother and sister you don't have what
[1:01:36] it takes we'll close that out with a
[1:01:37] scripture later you don't have what it
[1:01:39] takes what we got to do is stop and say
[1:01:42] Lord I am giving myself to you and let
[1:01:46] you mold me because the elect lady it
[1:01:48] says was found walking
[1:01:52] we jump right over it sometimes oh yeah
[1:01:54] she was in truth no she was found
[1:01:57] walking she wasn't sitting she wasn't
[1:01:59] crying she wasn't turning back she was
[1:02:02] walking she kept right on walking and
[1:02:05] the ingredient that she had that allowed
[1:02:07] her to continue to walk was truth amen
[1:02:11] without that truth she would have
[1:02:13] drifted into laodicea but she had truth
[1:02:16] and truth kept her on the right track
[1:02:18] truth kept her in the center of the road
[1:02:21] amen hallelujah
[1:02:23] so this great play is playing out in
[1:02:26] God's mind
[1:02:30] and it's being played out in your life
[1:02:34] did you realize he was a character in
[1:02:36] God's play
[1:02:38] amen
[1:02:39] now the director my brother and sister
[1:02:41] will drift into a little uh explanation
[1:02:44] of this in a minute but the director
[1:02:47] the coordinator
[1:02:49] he's the one who always says stop no
[1:02:52] no
[1:02:53] um don't walk in that way Walk This Way
[1:02:56] don't stand there stand here don't do do
[1:03:00] it like this until they believe that it
[1:03:04] is all just orchestrated perfectly
[1:03:08] now we look at our Christian Life like
[1:03:10] well praise the Lord God forgave me of
[1:03:12] my sin and uh he's filled me with the
[1:03:14] Holy Ghost can we say Amen to that and
[1:03:16] it is so then no my brother and sister
[1:03:18] God ordered your footsteps God ordered
[1:03:22] you to be where you are at amen God knew
[1:03:26] the days that you would stumble and fall
[1:03:28] God knew the days that you in
[1:03:30] desperation would cry out God knew the
[1:03:32] days that you would rise up and say I
[1:03:35] will finish this race
[1:03:36] God knew every one of those and he
[1:03:39] didn't come down and take that day out
[1:03:41] of your life because he thought it was
[1:03:43] too difficult you know what we do with
[1:03:45] our children
[1:03:47] young people hear me
[1:03:49] what we do with our children
[1:03:51] is there were certain aspects of our
[1:03:53] life
[1:03:54] that we didn't like
[1:03:57] every family will be a little different
[1:04:03] I didn't like it that I had to take the
[1:04:05] trash out and mow the lawn I didn't like
[1:04:07] it that as a 10 year old girl my parents
[1:04:10] expected me to wash the dishes and clean
[1:04:12] the table I didn't like that so what we
[1:04:13] do is we shelter our children from the
[1:04:16] things we didn't like
[1:04:18] and next thing you know you've got a
[1:04:20] bunch of kids I'm not talking about the
[1:04:21] world I'm talking about Believers
[1:04:23] children that are so sheltered and so so
[1:04:26] pampered because we don't want them to
[1:04:29] have to go through what we didn't like
[1:04:30] well maybe you wouldn't be who you are
[1:04:32] except for the time you went through
[1:04:34] things you didn't like so what you ought
[1:04:36] to do is say I made it by God's grace to
[1:04:39] be a believer and to be a reasonable
[1:04:41] sound responsible adult and if that
[1:04:44] formed me into that it ought to work for
[1:04:46] my children
[1:04:48] but instead we pamper in shelter
[1:04:52] well we grow up in a church
[1:04:55] and we become a pastor
[1:04:58] and the things we didn't like
[1:05:01] we try to shelter
[1:05:03] the church
[1:05:07] like repent
[1:05:09] and be baptized
[1:05:13] well if we just believe
[1:05:16] no if you believe you will repent
[1:05:19] it's that simple
[1:05:21] and if it worked
[1:05:23] Through the Ages for the saints of God
[1:05:25] it will work today we don't need to
[1:05:27] pamper this we don't need to do this
[1:05:29] young people hear me well when your mama
[1:05:32] makes it too easy on you you will regret
[1:05:34] it if the Lord tarries when you get
[1:05:36] older amen because you'll have habits of
[1:05:39] never make your bed and never hang your
[1:05:42] clothes up never do this amen and life
[1:05:45] is a lot easier I was a bachelor once
[1:05:47] amen it's a lot easier corn flakes for
[1:05:50] breakfast corn flakes for lunch corn
[1:05:52] flakes for supper amen and when your
[1:05:54] teeth fall fall out it must be someone
[1:05:57] else's fault it couldn't be my diet it
[1:06:00] couldn't be what I am and a worldly
[1:06:02] believer my brother and sister I left
[1:06:04] believer in there because that's how the
[1:06:07] devil wants to do it all of these I
[1:06:09] don't want to be too hard on my children
[1:06:10] I don't want my children to realize that
[1:06:13] if they don't have the Holy Ghost
[1:06:15] they're not going in a Rapture that's
[1:06:17] too hard so we're gonna soften this up
[1:06:20] and make it to where if we believe God
[1:06:22] sent a prophet it'll be okay but my
[1:06:25] brother and sister there'll come a day
[1:06:27] you'll regret it they'll regret it it's
[1:06:30] time to say child you're part of this
[1:06:32] household you're part of this family you
[1:06:35] hold up your end and in the end when
[1:06:37] your children are responsible and your
[1:06:40] grandchildren are responsible and if you
[1:06:42] live that long your great-grandchildren
[1:06:44] are responsible you won't look back and
[1:06:46] say I sure wished I had pampered them
[1:06:48] babies
[1:06:49] you'll be saying I want them to be
[1:06:51] rugged I want them to be real Believers
[1:06:54] I want them to realize they got to have
[1:06:55] the Holy Ghost I want them to realize
[1:06:58] that God's plan is the perfect plan my
[1:07:01] plan is not even on the table it's God's
[1:07:04] plan and Lord give us the strength to
[1:07:06] follow your plan
[1:07:08] Hallelujah
[1:07:11] now look here in Matthew 7 7 starting
[1:07:14] asking it shall be given you seek and ye
[1:07:17] shall find knock and it shall be opened
[1:07:19] in you I think we ought to teach on
[1:07:21] these things a little bit more amen you
[1:07:23] have young people uh maybe even starting
[1:07:26] young families and and the struggles of
[1:07:28] Life start coming amen you know it is
[1:07:31] when when you graduate from high school
[1:07:35] hallelujah sister Alice
[1:07:38] you just graduated from high school
[1:07:40] she's done an awesome whole list of
[1:07:41] credits and things that she already
[1:07:43] pressed into
[1:07:44] but I want to warn you sister Alex
[1:07:46] when you graduated for high school
[1:07:49] that was just the start of life
[1:07:52] it didn't start you know 17 18 20 years
[1:07:55] ago
[1:07:57] that's just the start of life because
[1:07:58] there comes a point everybody just looks
[1:08:01] at you like how are you going to support
[1:08:02] yourself
[1:08:04] and I want this who's going to pay for
[1:08:06] it
[1:08:08] and slowly your parents sister Alice it
[1:08:11] just happens it's heartbreaking
[1:08:13] slowly your parents just pulled back
[1:08:16] and you think man my mom my dad they're
[1:08:18] abandoning me
[1:08:20] no no no no no no no
[1:08:25] when that eagle flies out of the nest
[1:08:30] we've been around we have some big old
[1:08:31] Hawks that Nest right there at the house
[1:08:34] the instincts of a hawk and an eagle I'm
[1:08:36] just going to use them as a comparison
[1:08:38] the instinct is is the the parent flies
[1:08:41] over in our case flies over and lands on
[1:08:43] the pivot that's right there in the
[1:08:45] field
[1:08:46] and then hollers at the baby
[1:08:49] that's still up there in the tree
[1:08:51] now I'm making a lot of assumption
[1:08:53] because I don't know Hawk language
[1:08:56] but you can tell by what's happening
[1:08:58] they're calling them
[1:09:07] you can fly do it
[1:09:11] and pretty soon like sister Jerry calls
[1:09:13] me up one day well there's this young
[1:09:14] Hawk on the ground do you think it's
[1:09:16] hurt
[1:09:17] was after a great big storm
[1:09:19] big limb smashed right through their
[1:09:21] nest and it's like you think it's hurt
[1:09:24] she calls me back a couple minutes later
[1:09:25] and says no the other Hawk was out there
[1:09:29] sitting on the pivot and started calling
[1:09:31] to it
[1:09:32] and it did some hopping and bouncing and
[1:09:35] suddenly it remembered these are wings
[1:09:36] and God gave them to me to fly
[1:09:39] and they started flying and they're just
[1:09:42] there now we see them soaring they no
[1:09:45] longer hang in our tree they hang out in
[1:09:46] a tree a little farther up the draw
[1:09:49] because it's more isolated and you'll
[1:09:51] look up there and they're having a
[1:09:53] jubilee every time there's one of them
[1:09:54] little thermals you'll see them all out
[1:09:56] there just up and down and up and down
[1:10:00] but you know that this stage right now
[1:10:02] if you do the research
[1:10:04] mama will haul or come
[1:10:07] and that young Hawk says
[1:10:09] I'm a hawk
[1:10:11] I fly or I want to fly
[1:10:14] I eat what I want to eat
[1:10:17] I go where I want to go
[1:10:21] and God
[1:10:23] is allowing you and eyes to dress
[1:10:25] rehearsal
[1:10:26] we're learning to fly
[1:10:28] we're learning to make those decisions
[1:10:30] on our own we're learning to step out
[1:10:32] you say well brother Paul what's so deep
[1:10:35] about that no I'm not talking about
[1:10:37] whether you drive a blue car or a red
[1:10:39] car or a white car or what brand of car
[1:10:43] I'm not talking about what kind of shoes
[1:10:45] you wear or what kind of clothes you
[1:10:47] choose I'm talking about the very
[1:10:50] Foundation of deciding I am
[1:10:53] part of the Great I Am
[1:10:56] I am the son I am the daughter I am the
[1:11:00] manifestation of almighty God those are
[1:11:02] the Deep decisions what kind of job you
[1:11:05] have what kind of career you have oh we
[1:11:07] make such a big deal out of it uh you
[1:11:09] know doctors obviously make more money
[1:11:11] than than you know Common Labor uh but
[1:11:14] they also have a lot more responsibility
[1:11:15] and some people just can't handle the
[1:11:17] responsibility
[1:11:18] and so all of these decisions that's
[1:11:20] being made but God doesn't really you
[1:11:22] realize God don't care about your career
[1:11:25] God doesn't care about your 401k God
[1:11:27] doesn't care about the quality or the
[1:11:30] value of your clothes or the location of
[1:11:32] your home God does not care one single
[1:11:35] drop about that what he wants you to do
[1:11:38] is take care of the gift that he has
[1:11:42] given you and that gift is the very Gift
[1:11:44] of Life the Holy Ghost and he's calling
[1:11:47] you to that amen so he's telling here in
[1:11:50] the words in Matthew ask and it shall be
[1:11:52] given you what are you asking for amen
[1:11:55] seek and ye shall find and it shall be
[1:11:58] oh knock and it shall be open to you for
[1:12:01] everyone that asketh receiveth
[1:12:03] that's pretty straight up words my
[1:12:05] brother and sister but if you're going
[1:12:07] to come out here and you're going to ask
[1:12:09] for a Bentley you may never get it
[1:12:12] you're going to ask for a Porsche oh can
[1:12:14] I narrow this down some of you drive
[1:12:15] some pretty fancy cars amen I might
[1:12:18] offend somebody here in the church amen
[1:12:20] hallelujah well we just happened to
[1:12:22] drive old Chevys which some of you will
[1:12:24] tell me right to my face it means that
[1:12:26] we like to work on what we drive amen
[1:12:28] but I'm telling you those Fords are just
[1:12:30] found on the side the road dead is what
[1:12:32] they always said amen and all of those
[1:12:35] things again and we can banter this all
[1:12:37] back and forth but you think God cares
[1:12:39] whether you drive a Ford or not or a
[1:12:42] Chevy or not or a Mercedes or a BMW or
[1:12:46] not God does not care one drop and just
[1:12:50] so we're clear here in the church I
[1:12:52] don't either
[1:12:53] amen so if you're blessed enough to
[1:12:55] drive a really nice car God bless you
[1:12:58] but if you were driving a cheap car I
[1:13:00] would tell you what you could do with
[1:13:01] the money you didn't waste on that car
[1:13:04] that didn't go over very well
[1:13:08] so what are we asking for
[1:13:11] for everyone that asks us to receiveth
[1:13:13] I've never seen one one that sought the
[1:13:16] holy ghost that sought the presence of
[1:13:18] God in their life with sincerity and
[1:13:21] diligence that God didn't come on the
[1:13:23] scene and answer that prayer and fill
[1:13:25] them with the Holy Ghost I've never seen
[1:13:27] one that was seeking amen now we know
[1:13:30] that we as individuals don't seek God
[1:13:32] God seeks us but there is a depth that
[1:13:35] God allows for you and I to seek amen we
[1:13:38] can have superficial or we can ask and
[1:13:41] seek to have a deeper relationship and
[1:13:44] when we start seeking a deep
[1:13:46] relationship God is right there to give
[1:13:49] us a deep relationship amen and so as we
[1:13:53] would seek these things we find amen and
[1:13:56] when we knock it shall be opened amen oh
[1:14:00] what man is there of you whom if his son
[1:14:03] asked bread will give him a stone
[1:14:05] or if you ask a fish we'll give him a
[1:14:07] serpent if ye then being evil know how
[1:14:10] to give good gifts unto your children
[1:14:13] how much more shall your father which in
[1:14:16] heaven give good things and ask him I'm
[1:14:19] telling you I want more of Jesus Christ
[1:14:21] I want a deeper relationship I want to
[1:14:24] have something that will stand the test
[1:14:27] of time I don't want to become Paul
[1:14:29] Halen that Pastor that used to Pastor a
[1:14:32] church in Idaho but now he's been swept
[1:14:35] away I want to be standing here might
[1:14:37] have limbs broke off I might be scarred
[1:14:40] but I want to be found planted by the
[1:14:42] rivers of Living Water I want to be
[1:14:45] found having stood the test
[1:14:48] Hallelujah
[1:14:50] what do we ask for I say the only thing
[1:14:53] that we need to pray to God for you say
[1:14:55] brother Paul the only thing yes the only
[1:14:58] thing and the reason I say that is is if
[1:15:01] you ask for Christ he will give you
[1:15:04] himself and he said to you seek me first
[1:15:07] all the rest of this will be added to
[1:15:10] you amen you don't need to pray for
[1:15:12] these things you need to pray for the
[1:15:14] Holy Ghost for the outpouring of God
[1:15:17] that you can walk through the open door
[1:15:19] into his presence and you'll find you'll
[1:15:22] have everything you need to live life
[1:15:24] everything
[1:15:27] amen
[1:15:31] I'll leave that alone amen
[1:15:34] now
[1:15:35] what are the gifts we're asking for
[1:15:37] Christ are we not amen now what is the
[1:15:40] bride clothed in
[1:15:45] Christ the word
[1:15:47] so if the bride is clothed in Christ the
[1:15:50] word when we have Christ we have the
[1:15:53] covering of the word
[1:15:55] we've all seen the artist's rendition of
[1:15:58] the Bride amen and she's clothed
[1:16:00] entirely The Veil The Dress everything
[1:16:04] is the scripture
[1:16:05] amen have you seen that
[1:16:07] so as you see that the bride clothed in
[1:16:10] the word she's got Christ now I want to
[1:16:12] put this I've never been a bride
[1:16:15] I'm sorry
[1:16:17] just I can only speak from what I see
[1:16:20] but I don't believe there's ever a bride
[1:16:23] waits for a couple hours before her
[1:16:25] wedding
[1:16:26] and says I guess I ought to try on the
[1:16:28] dress
[1:16:30] puts us to Rachel on the spot sister
[1:16:32] Rachel did you try your dress on before
[1:16:34] your wedding
[1:16:36] now
[1:16:40] I know you girl
[1:16:45] imagine I hope I don't go over the limit
[1:16:48] here
[1:16:50] but here we are it's time to go to the
[1:16:52] wedding
[1:16:54] and we're like to a bridesmaid zip up my
[1:16:57] dress
[1:16:58] I'm trying
[1:17:05] come on suck it up I am
[1:17:09] it's still um
[1:17:13] call the same sir Scott to come make
[1:17:14] adjustments right now gotta let out this
[1:17:16] seem that or even maybe almost on the
[1:17:19] worst side I don't know worse
[1:17:23] try the dress on and
[1:17:25] this don't fit me I mean it's just
[1:17:29] sleeves are all baggy and it's the waist
[1:17:32] is down here
[1:17:35] no no every girl I ever met
[1:17:39] amen
[1:17:40] when she was getting married
[1:17:43] they stood in front of a mirror
[1:17:46] and they said
[1:17:48] this has got to be perfect come on
[1:17:50] Friends
[1:17:51] girls come on you're my girlfriends tell
[1:17:53] me how do I look
[1:17:57] tell me the truth you look gorgeous no
[1:18:00] tell me the truth
[1:18:04] and this bride of laodicea my brother
[1:18:06] and sister this is why I say this is
[1:18:09] just the dress rehearsal she is oh
[1:18:11] brother Paul you say she's just trying
[1:18:13] on the word yeah no I mean literally
[1:18:15] when I say this she is trying on the
[1:18:17] word because there's times that we put
[1:18:19] the word on and we don't feel good we
[1:18:22] don't think it's us it doesn't really
[1:18:23] seem to fit us and we do but you see God
[1:18:26] is causing you and I as we try on the
[1:18:29] word we're not only do you know the word
[1:18:32] is changing you
[1:18:33] and did you know that you are changing
[1:18:35] the word see now somebody's going to go
[1:18:37] well you're changing the word yes you're
[1:18:40] changing the word
[1:18:41] from something on a written page
[1:18:45] into flesh
[1:18:50] are you with me
[1:18:52] because as long as the word stays you
[1:18:54] know you sisters is so you know you can
[1:18:57] go down there to the fabric store I've
[1:18:58] watched my wife in younger years so all
[1:19:01] these pretty little dresses for my girls
[1:19:03] and and you know you can go down there
[1:19:04] and pull a pattern out and you can say
[1:19:06] oh this is going to be so beautiful on
[1:19:08] my daughter and you take the pattern
[1:19:10] home and you open the cabinet and you
[1:19:11] slide it in there and then you can tell
[1:19:13] everybody you want you have the most
[1:19:15] beautiful pattern
[1:19:19] but you've got to change the pattern
[1:19:22] into something that changes the girl
[1:19:26] and when we are changing the word from
[1:19:29] being on the page into something living
[1:19:32] now you say brother Paul we're not doing
[1:19:33] it but we have a part
[1:19:36] it's Christ in us that's doing the work
[1:19:38] but we have a part now come on rubber
[1:19:42] meets the road are y'all okay this
[1:19:43] morning
[1:19:44] when the rubber meets the road how many
[1:19:46] times you've heard in your life
[1:19:47] something preached and your first
[1:19:49] instinct is a pushback
[1:19:52] hmm none of you
[1:19:55] wow phenomenal
[1:19:58] so I'll just stand up and be the guinea
[1:20:00] pig there was many times through the
[1:20:02] years I pushed back
[1:20:04] I push back and you know what God did he
[1:20:07] just let me by the side of the road for
[1:20:09] a while until I got hungry and thirsty
[1:20:11] then he come back and said oh here's the
[1:20:13] word and at that point in my life it's
[1:20:14] like
[1:20:16] I need that that's who I am I got to
[1:20:19] claim that
[1:20:21] you see so this is not one-sided
[1:20:23] otherwise it wouldn't be free moral
[1:20:26] agency
[1:20:27] it would be God forced
[1:20:31] so when this is happening you have this
[1:20:33] young lady she's getting married amen
[1:20:36] she's not going to wait for the morning
[1:20:38] of her wedding to try on her dress but
[1:20:41] she's going to go there and I might be
[1:20:43] wrong here but I think some of you girls
[1:20:45] when you got married probably tried that
[1:20:47] dress on in secret did a little Twirl in
[1:20:49] the room like my look how I look this is
[1:20:53] beautiful I'm Gonna Knock his socks off
[1:20:55] when he walks and I come up that aisle
[1:20:58] he's just going to be standing over
[1:20:59] there I've witnessed this at wedding
[1:21:00] Saints I've been there before and
[1:21:02] watched the groom standing up there just
[1:21:05] laughs
[1:21:07] oh my nothing to be ashamed of why
[1:21:10] because he saw her in the absolute
[1:21:13] Purity and the beauty of a bride and
[1:21:17] God's not looking for a bride that's
[1:21:18] waiting for a marriage supper to be
[1:21:21] announced to run out try the dress on
[1:21:23] can zip it up or it's like a baggy
[1:21:26] potato sack and just oh I'm gonna do
[1:21:28] this no my brother sister God said I
[1:21:30] want a bride that when they hear the
[1:21:34] carriage coming they can step out and
[1:21:37] say I've been waiting for you I've been
[1:21:40] sowing at the Midnight Hour I've been
[1:21:43] trimming and tucking and doing
[1:21:44] everything that I would be of the beauty
[1:21:47] of the word that you called me with
[1:21:51] hallelujah amen what's she doing she is
[1:21:54] preparing herself amen and the word
[1:21:57] tells us that we should judge ourselves
[1:21:59] so there she is this bride is looking at
[1:22:03] how she's clothed and she is judging
[1:22:06] herself and you'll find that if we get
[1:22:08] too critical we'll never be happy
[1:22:11] serving God and if we're to Alaska days
[1:22:14] ago we will find ourselves saying well
[1:22:16] God doesn't care about that my brother's
[1:22:19] sister what God's looking for is a bride
[1:22:21] that's confident of who she is and what
[1:22:24] she was called for of the relationship
[1:22:26] that she has and that you won't have a
[1:22:29] bride coming up the aisle to get married
[1:22:31] and voicing to the people as she goes by
[1:22:33] I don't know if I should do this or not
[1:22:36] I mean I I don't know it's just the
[1:22:38] right guy is this the wrong I don't know
[1:22:39] what do you think well I mean uh just is
[1:22:42] he is he okay is this gonna work am I
[1:22:45] really a bride
[1:22:47] no sir you want a bride
[1:22:49] a young man wants to marry a girl that
[1:22:52] says I want to be your wife
[1:22:54] I want my life to have your name stamped
[1:22:58] on it
[1:22:59] Hallelujah
[1:23:01] that's why the whole world I hope this
[1:23:03] doesn't offend anybody this nonsense
[1:23:06] I'm going to marry you but keep my name
[1:23:08] that's the scripture being fulfilled my
[1:23:11] brother and sister if they don't want
[1:23:13] his name they don't really want to be
[1:23:15] his wife they might as well just say we
[1:23:19] have signed a certificate of agreeance
[1:23:23] I agree that I will cook your breakfast
[1:23:28] two times a week
[1:23:30] I will do my laundry you do your laundry
[1:23:35] you pay the mortgage I'll pay the car
[1:23:37] payment
[1:23:40] wow
[1:23:42] a few years you violated the contract
[1:23:47] but when you have I hope you take this
[1:23:50] in the spiritual a young woman that says
[1:23:53] good times Bad Times Hard Times Hard
[1:23:56] struggles and the beauty of life I want
[1:23:59] your name I want to be identified with
[1:24:01] you I want to be known as your wife
[1:24:04] amen what is she doing when she puts on
[1:24:07] that wedding garment and she's there and
[1:24:09] she's
[1:24:11] prepared herself in her beauty and
[1:24:13] presented herself what she's doing is
[1:24:16] saying I'm willing to give my very best
[1:24:19] to you
[1:24:20] and it's that that makes life and it
[1:24:23] comes I hope you're following me in the
[1:24:25] spiritual
[1:24:26] amen you see no one wants to show up my
[1:24:30] brother and sister at their own wedding
[1:24:32] with regret
[1:24:34] you know that's what the Rapture is my
[1:24:36] brother and sister it is that time face
[1:24:38] to face as it were the presentation of
[1:24:41] the Bride who wants to be one on that
[1:24:44] day with regret who wants to be the one
[1:24:46] saying you know what it's there now you
[1:24:49] think about this as I brought out to you
[1:24:51] earlier in a wedding natural type amen
[1:24:53] you remember what it's like there's
[1:24:56] always
[1:24:58] a sister

[1:25:15] nope you're walking too fast you need to
[1:25:18] stop here this is where you meet the the
[1:25:19] uh bride and her dad meets right here
[1:25:23] and and he needs to come down to her he

[1:25:38] level don't make dad go up to him
[1:25:42] I've never thought of that in my life

[1:25:54] and then you hear it
[1:25:56] stop stop stop stop everybody go back
[1:25:59] out
[1:26:00] piano player start in like this start it
[1:26:03] again come on I've been to weddings
[1:26:05] where the rehearsals the wedding took
[1:26:07] like 15 minutes the rehearsal took four
[1:26:09] hours
[1:26:14] but you that isn't all that bad because
[1:26:16] that 15 minutes were beautiful
[1:26:18] they weren't chaos young men you know
[1:26:21] coming up to stand on the thing and you
[1:26:23] know you find them standing on the side
[1:26:25] over here
[1:26:29] no sir you stand right where that little
[1:26:31] dotted tape is and you stand there with
[1:26:33] your hands together and you pick a spot
[1:26:36] on that wall and look at it and don't
[1:26:37] move
[1:26:40] oh no I've been around a couple weddings
[1:26:45] but if you look at the word of God
[1:26:48] it's exactly what the word's telling us
[1:26:50] I want you to walk like this I want you
[1:26:52] to dress like this I want you to talk
[1:26:54] and live and all of these things God
[1:26:57] wasn't sloppy God didn't say just kind
[1:26:59] of do it however you want and if read my
[1:27:01] Bible and pray it'll just cover
[1:27:03] everything oh my brother and sister no
[1:27:04] especially when you go back in the Old
[1:27:06] Testament God was very specific go back
[1:27:08] in the book of the Leviticus will a
[1:27:10] Bible study tonight touch on those
[1:27:11] things God was so precise exactly what
[1:27:14] this will be just like this and then we
[1:27:17] come along to the New Testament and
[1:27:18] everybody says oh that was the Old
[1:27:20] Testament under the law we don't have to
[1:27:21] do none of that anymore
[1:27:24] and Jesus said no no no I didn't come
[1:27:27] to get rid of the law
[1:27:29] I come to live the law out by writing it
[1:27:33] on the tables of your heart
[1:27:36] didn't need to write it on his own heart
[1:27:38] he was the word
[1:27:40] but he wrote it on the tables of our
[1:27:42] hearts
[1:27:42] that we could live the word
[1:27:45] okay this present rate will just go
[1:27:47] right from this into Bible study
[1:27:50] amen now we'll just bounce real quick
[1:27:53] through this second Corinthians the
[1:27:56] fifth chapter verses one through nines
[1:27:58] talking about how uh Earthly house amen
[1:28:02] that we groan Desiring to be clothed
[1:28:04] upon which the house which is from
[1:28:06] heaven and that being clothed we won't
[1:28:08] be found naked amen so this is the
[1:28:11] wedding dress now I'm going to throw
[1:28:13] this out hey man just count this as a
[1:28:15] future reference but my brother and
[1:28:17] sister what is shame you know to see or
[1:28:20] witness a wedding in a message Church of
[1:28:22] a young lady showing up with the latest
[1:28:25] of marriage dress a wedding dress
[1:28:27] fashion in other words this young lady
[1:28:29] is walking up the aisle and there was a
[1:28:32] lot of oh
[1:28:35] and I don't know if the O's where they
[1:28:37] were shocked that she would show up in
[1:28:38] her own wedding dress that way or they
[1:28:40] thought she was beautiful in that dress
[1:28:42] but I can tell you the minister that
[1:28:45] married them
[1:28:46] never raised his head once
[1:28:50] during the wedding
[1:28:55] we can't dress ourselves
[1:28:58] in the fashion
[1:29:01] and expect our wedding to be something
[1:29:03] we're proud of
[1:29:05] oh might be at the moment
[1:29:07] but when you get a little older a little
[1:29:09] more maturity you're going to look back
[1:29:10] and say did I really get married in a
[1:29:12] strapless gown
[1:29:14] in front of
[1:29:16] 500 believers
[1:29:19] something to think about
[1:29:21] because you see there's a direct
[1:29:22] correlation in that spirit
[1:29:24] of presenting ourselves to Jesus Christ
[1:29:28] and here it's telling us that we would
[1:29:30] be clothed upon so that our nakedness
[1:29:34] would not show
[1:29:36] that we would not have that amen and so
[1:29:40] it's there as we'll come and look at
[1:29:42] this we want to come always confident
[1:29:45] verse 6 knowing that whilst we're at
[1:29:47] home in this body absent from the Lord
[1:29:49] for we walk by faith not by sight so God
[1:29:53] is trying to clothe you and I with the
[1:29:56] word that we can walk in confidence
[1:29:59] before him and let our faith be
[1:30:02] expressed not Walking On The Fringe not
[1:30:04] presenting ourselves as friends because
[1:30:06] my brother and sister the prophet of God
[1:30:08] speaks very clear and we have struggled
[1:30:11] sometimes with the things that he says
[1:30:13] but I say it's the truth amen and so
[1:30:16] here we are amen three kinds of
[1:30:18] believers
[1:30:20] we don't want to believe there's three
[1:30:21] kinds of believers
[1:30:23] we don't want to preach about three
[1:30:25] kinds of believers
[1:30:28] but there is
[1:30:30] it's not simple what we ought to do is
[1:30:32] be sincere before God clothed me Lord
[1:30:34] clothe me with your word I don't want to
[1:30:37] be I don't even want to be either one of
[1:30:39] those other two Believers I want to be a
[1:30:42] real believer clothe Me Lord
[1:30:45] and you can't put on too much clothes of
[1:30:48] the word
[1:30:49] you can't be overdressed
[1:30:52] you hear words like oh she's overdressed
[1:30:56] looks like a closed horse
[1:31:00] wow
[1:31:02] you mean she's too much of a Christian
[1:31:05] she's too much of a believer
[1:31:07] she desires too much of the Holy Ghost
[1:31:10] come on my brother and sister
[1:31:13] this is a rehearsal
[1:31:17] hmm
[1:31:22] let me move on quickly
[1:31:25] you see what the rehearsal is is when
[1:31:27] all the Kinks when the rehearsal is
[1:31:29] finished is when all the Kinks are
[1:31:30] worked out
[1:31:36] anybody feel like confessing this
[1:31:37] morning what some of our kinks are
[1:31:41] yeah
[1:31:43] imagine rolling a whiteboard out here
[1:31:46] South Africa with the youth I'm speaking
[1:31:48] to them the quote where the prophet of
[1:31:50] God says overcoming the devil is when
[1:31:52] you recognize all of his tricks and
[1:31:55] everything and we had that as a lesson
[1:31:58] with the young people and at first they
[1:31:59] were very resistant you know not too
[1:32:01] much speaking out but when the gate
[1:32:04] opened I'm up here riding on a
[1:32:05] whiteboard
[1:32:07] and you know I already told them you
[1:32:10] know just because they voice it out
[1:32:11] don't mean it's their issue but I'll
[1:32:13] tell you what it was still pretty funny
[1:32:14] when some kids like lost
[1:32:17] everybody's
[1:32:21] as though no one ever
[1:32:24] had lust
[1:32:28] hmm
[1:32:30] wow that's strange you mean you actually
[1:32:32] are that low that stoop down that low
[1:32:36] no I was like that's one who's confident
[1:32:39] of where they stand and not afraid to
[1:32:42] mention it that's one of the devil's
[1:32:43] tricks
[1:32:44] what's this we had a whole board full
[1:32:47] wrote out
[1:32:51] I had young people come up to me and say
[1:32:53] thank you for doing that
[1:32:55] because you see
[1:32:57] we tend to take these things
[1:33:04] now I was raised in a message Church
[1:33:07] message parents spent my whole life in
[1:33:10] the message I couldn't possibly have a
[1:33:13] lying spirit
[1:33:14] I couldn't possibly be tempted by
[1:33:17] cigarettes or alcohol or lust of the
[1:33:19] flesh
[1:33:21] and they hide it
[1:33:22] that's right
[1:33:24] and then you'll have a young man come to
[1:33:26] you
[1:33:27] and say thank you for bringing that out
[1:33:29] when that come out I said Lord I'm
[1:33:32] claiming my Deliverance
[1:33:34] my brother and sister this Bride As She
[1:33:37] dressed herself amen it's here in the
[1:33:40] rehearsal she's dressing herself and
[1:33:42] every time she applies the word and puts
[1:33:45] another layer of the word on it's
[1:33:48] sealing her against the spirit of
[1:33:51] laodicea it's not a burden to this bride
[1:33:54] it is her armor it is her protection
[1:33:58] she's putting on the word and Satan
[1:34:01] can't get through the word and it's
[1:34:02] coming that it's not your overdress no
[1:34:05] such thing for the bride of Christ to be
[1:34:08] overdressed with the word amen the world
[1:34:11] wants you just put on just as little as
[1:34:13] you can and claim the name of Christ but
[1:34:15] God called us to the rehearsal to be
[1:34:18] brought into this place and when The
[1:34:20] Kinks are worked out we get to go into
[1:34:22] Rapture Can someone say Lord hurry up
[1:34:24] and get the Kinks out of us amen
[1:34:27] everything being said in order now
[1:34:29] Revelations 3 5. amen he did overcometh
[1:34:34] amen now we're spanning Church ages here
[1:34:38] as we jump down a little further in
[1:34:39] scripture but he that overcometh the
[1:34:42] same shall be clothed in white reignment
[1:34:45] it's not just talking about some she'll
[1:34:47] have a testimony or she'll have this
[1:34:48] she'll actually be clothed in white
[1:34:52] raiment and I will not blot out his name
[1:34:55] out of the book of life but I will
[1:34:57] confess his name before my father and
[1:34:59] before his angels He bit half an ear let
[1:35:02] him hear what the spirit saith under the
[1:35:04] churches and to the angel of the Church
[1:35:06] of Philadelphia right these sayings
[1:35:09] saith he that is Holy he that is true he
[1:35:12] that hath the Key of David he that
[1:35:15] openeth and no man shutteth and shutteth
[1:35:18] and no man openeth I Know Thy works
[1:35:23] I know thy works
[1:35:27] it don't matter what the preacher thinks
[1:35:28] what they think that church over there
[1:35:31] thinks this evangelist thinks
[1:35:33] he knows that's right
[1:35:35] he knows our struggle he knows how many
[1:35:38] times we're willing figuratively to walk
[1:35:41] up and stand in the right place he knows
[1:35:44] how many times we're willing to say Lord
[1:35:46] forgive me he knows the desire of that
[1:35:49] heart that is anguished the very moment
[1:35:52] it makes a mistake he knows this
[1:35:55] amen
[1:35:58] oh Hallelujah
[1:36:01] I Know Thy Works behold I have set
[1:36:03] before thee an Open Door
[1:36:05] and no man can shut it for thou Hast
[1:36:07] little strength he was talking about me
[1:36:09] here
[1:36:12] might be to the Philadelphian Church age
[1:36:13] but he's talking to me has little
[1:36:14] strength come on my brother and sister I
[1:36:17] hope this doesn't just Mar my testimony
[1:36:19] before you but I'm not some big
[1:36:21] Powerhouse of a guy that just bulldozes
[1:36:24] his way through everything that Satan
[1:36:25] throws in front of him there's times I
[1:36:28] lay awake half of the night anguished
[1:36:30] over things and circumstances and I
[1:36:32] don't seem to find an answer and it says
[1:36:35] some Midnight Hour if you would cry out
[1:36:37] and I can cry out and it still doesn't
[1:36:39] seem like there's an answer
[1:36:42] but somewhere in the night you fall
[1:36:44] asleep and wake up in the morning and
[1:36:46] there has been a peace that settled over
[1:36:48] you amen there's been something that has
[1:36:50] changed the atmosphere is different and
[1:36:53] you would get up that day and say you
[1:36:55] know what okay Lord whatever it is I can
[1:36:57] endure it I can press through it I can
[1:36:59] survive I can move on Amen see the door
[1:37:04] the open door has been set before us

[1:37:09] shut it amen yeah little strength but
[1:37:12] you kept my word isn't that beautiful
[1:37:15] can we do a lot of things I might not
[1:37:17] travel the world evangelize the world
[1:37:19] but we can keep the word amen we can get
[1:37:22] up in the morning and resolve from our
[1:37:23] heart Lord today I want to keep your
[1:37:26] word Lord I don't care if the world
[1:37:28] notices anyone notices I am going to
[1:37:31] keep your word

[1:37:36] now look 3 18 I counsel thee
[1:37:41] buy of me gold tried in the fire of the
[1:37:43] thou mayest be rich and white raiment
[1:37:45] that thou mayest be clothed and that the
[1:37:47] shame of thy nakedness you're once again
[1:37:50] being clothed
[1:37:52] this dress rehearsal for the bride
[1:37:55] she's coming
[1:37:57] now some people I've heard it preached
[1:38:00] oh that's the nakedness of laodicea and
[1:38:03] how people are everywhere with no
[1:38:04] clothes on well I might fit
[1:38:06] but I'll tell you what's much worse than
[1:38:08] that
[1:38:10] is a spiritual life
[1:38:12] it's not covered with one bit or very
[1:38:15] little of the word
[1:38:17] very little of God covering their life
[1:38:25] yeah
[1:38:27] water it down
[1:38:32] oh I don't want to distract them already
[1:38:34] too late too long
[1:38:36] Hallelujah
[1:38:38] are we okay just to finish a couple more
[1:38:42] we go back to Acts 14.
[1:38:46] speaking about the doors been open to
[1:38:47] the Gentiles
[1:38:49] Saints we're sitting here with an open
[1:38:50] door this word is no longer a book
[1:38:54] wrapped up this is a book revealed amen
[1:38:58] amen This Is The Life revealed and it
[1:39:03] needs to be revealed in US amen not just
[1:39:07] to a prophet not just to a message in
[1:39:10] general but Lord let the word let that
[1:39:12] be one of the things you ask for let the
[1:39:14] word Lord be revealed in me amen amen
[1:39:18] hallelujah now I want to just go to
[1:39:21] Revelations
[1:39:22] chapter 4 part 1.
[1:39:26] I thought this is ironic
[1:39:29] very ironic
[1:39:31] almost didn't use it because I thought
[1:39:33] some of you'd be like yeah you've
[1:39:34] already ran out brother Paul
[1:39:38] hope we don't run out of time too quick
[1:39:40] here now that we can get right into this
[1:39:42] and we want to see how that flows into
[1:39:45] the human being
[1:39:46] it's a beautiful story right here if we
[1:39:48] can just get to it all right yes the
[1:39:51] rock confession
[1:39:53] what Peter was
[1:39:56] he would build his church upon Peter's
[1:40:00] confession
[1:40:01] he said some that stand here shall not
[1:40:04] taste of death till they see the Son of
[1:40:07] God coming in his kingdom now remember
[1:40:09] he spoke some that was more than one
[1:40:12] wasn't it some would say many more than
[1:40:15] one but now look all of his disciples
[1:40:18] were standing there and he was asking
[1:40:21] each one of them what do you think about
[1:40:23] this and what do you think about that
[1:40:27] and but he said there's some of you
[1:40:29] standing here some standing here will
[1:40:31] not taste of death until they see the
[1:40:33] son of man coming in his kingdom oh my I
[1:40:36] believe that today my brother and sister
[1:40:38] I believe it enough I prayed for years
[1:40:40] for my mother as she got older that God
[1:40:43] would Grant to her to be one of those
[1:40:45] that was alive and remain but yet we
[1:40:47] always want to temper everything in our
[1:40:49] life Lord thy will be done amen you know
[1:40:54] was I really looking hoping just that my
[1:40:57] mother would be alive and remain maybe
[1:40:59] really what was in the depths of my
[1:41:01] heart was crying out Lord come quickly
[1:41:03] Lord come quickly and I still pray that
[1:41:06] I still desire that Lord come quickly
[1:41:09] amen
[1:41:13] what a statement two thousand years ago
[1:41:15] that was stated well it is God's word
[1:41:18] infallible every word that he says will
[1:41:20] come to pass now if we want turnover
[1:41:23] then 17th chapter of Matthew is the next
[1:41:26] when he taken a few days that only taken
[1:41:28] Peter James and John up into the
[1:41:30] mountain apart to be witness Peter James
[1:41:33] and John and they seen the kingdom of
[1:41:36] heaven coming
[1:41:40] hmm
[1:41:42] kingdom of God
[1:41:44] come in power
[1:41:47] I jumped down the line there sorry but
[1:41:49] that distracted you
[1:41:54] be witness seen the kingdom of God come
[1:41:57] in power that's right
[1:42:00] are you with me
[1:42:04] no God
[1:42:05] allowed them
[1:42:07] to see
[1:42:09] it coming
[1:42:11] to pass
[1:42:13] everything that Jesus had spoke
[1:42:17] could be summed up in that experience on
[1:42:20] the mountain
[1:42:22] there's way more to the gospel no my
[1:42:25] brother and sister
[1:42:26] it's all encapsulating when you see the
[1:42:30] kingdom of God come
[1:42:33] everything you and I need to make the
[1:42:35] Rapture brother Brown says it's already
[1:42:37] in you and when the kingdom of God comes
[1:42:40] down and rests upon you what does it do
[1:42:43] it releases that amen what was
[1:42:47] encapsulated in you is released and when
[1:42:51] that's released you will find that as I
[1:42:53] spoke to you earlier when you receive
[1:42:55] the Holy Ghost the rest of your life
[1:42:58] will come in Balance amen we can try to
[1:43:01] put our life in Balance all we want but
[1:43:05] without the Holy Ghost it will never
[1:43:08] stay there amen that is what anchors it
[1:43:11] in the soul of man is the Holy Ghost the
[1:43:14] spirit of God Amen so they seen the
[1:43:16] kingdom of God come in power they seen
[1:43:19] the coming of the kingdom of God
[1:43:21] rehearsed
[1:43:22] it was right there playing it out now my
[1:43:25] brother and sister everything that Jesus
[1:43:27] was speaking there was not entirely for
[1:43:30] our day nor was it entirely for that day
[1:43:33] but the word overlapped and covered all
[1:43:36] the same and it was there now I
[1:43:38] convoluted that didn't I
[1:43:42] part of it applied there part of it
[1:43:44] applies here all of it applied to the
[1:43:45] kingdom of God
[1:43:47] now look at this see the rehearsing of
[1:43:50] it was the coming
[1:43:52] of the Lord
[1:43:54] not the rapture
[1:43:57] the coming
[1:43:58] of the lord The Rapture didn't take
[1:43:59] place on the mountain
[1:44:02] but it's coming did
[1:44:04] and we have a coming
[1:44:06] because the word has been opened and
[1:44:08] Christ is in his word and when it was
[1:44:11] opened it has come to us amen so we are
[1:44:15] sitting here today the Most Blessed the
[1:44:18] the oh I I'm failing for word Saints
[1:44:21] amen we have just received so much
[1:44:23] because God said I'm going to come I'm
[1:44:26] not going to make great men be this and
[1:44:28] great men be that I'm going to come to
[1:44:30] you personally and open my word to you
[1:44:32] and when he opened the word to you
[1:44:34] something energized what was already in
[1:44:37] you and you can come and stand and you
[1:44:39] look at this see now the kingdom of God
[1:44:41] rehearsed they were brought into view of
[1:44:44] watching the kingdom of God be rehearsed
[1:44:46] as it come the issuing in of the
[1:44:50] Millennium they seen the rehearsal oh
[1:44:53] brother Branham doesn't stop it that
[1:44:55] they just seen him coming amen the
[1:44:57] presence of God to the mountain brother
[1:44:59] random says they saw it all the way to
[1:45:03] the millennium all my brother and sister
[1:45:06] I'm telling you the millennium's right
[1:45:08] next door amen and the word has been
[1:45:10] opened to you and I and the Millennium
[1:45:12] is real amen a thousand years of Peace
[1:45:16] amen a thousand years that Satan is
[1:45:19] bound and we are here today in our
[1:45:22] moments oh please bear with me in our
[1:45:25] moments we are here and I have seen it
[1:45:27] and I have seen it and I've seen times
[1:45:30] that I questioned it but I have seen the
[1:45:32] devil bound my brother and sister I have
[1:45:35] seen peace go to people who are
[1:45:37] Disturbed people that are broke up and
[1:45:40] and in their minds and in their spirit
[1:45:42] and I've seen the power of God come down
[1:45:44] and deliver them don't tell me the word
[1:45:48] is not alive and well today and more
[1:45:50] than able to deliver you and I from
[1:45:53] every circumstance amen what we got to
[1:45:56] do is realize this is not the end the
[1:46:00] end is what the word declared of us we
[1:46:02] are in the rehearsal and if God requires
[1:46:05] you to walk up that aisle again and
[1:46:07] stand on that little spot again one time
[1:46:10] two times three times four times it
[1:46:12] doesn't matter because God wants your
[1:46:15] life to line up with his plan and he's
[1:46:18] willing patiently
[1:46:20] to bring you through it
[1:46:22] until we stand right where he wants us
[1:46:24] to stand
[1:46:26] oh Hallelujah
[1:46:28] let me just close with this right here
[1:46:31] amen
[1:46:33] remember when brother Branham saw the
[1:46:35] vision of the Bride
[1:46:40] for years now I'm not speaking for you
[1:46:41] I'm speaking for Paul
[1:46:44] for years that Vision was incredible wow
[1:46:49] wow look look
[1:46:53] what's so kind of brother Brown to let
[1:46:55] him see oh
[1:46:59] my brother sister do you realize
[1:47:04] that was
[1:47:06] a vision of our rehearsal
[1:47:13] that was us
[1:47:16] and you say but that was the Rapture now
[1:47:18] this could be you know a little bit of
[1:47:20] disagreement on this that was the
[1:47:23] rapture
[1:47:24] I think it was the rehearsal
[1:47:26] the reason I believe is a rehearsal is
[1:47:28] because there were those that were out
[1:47:29] of step out of time out of place
[1:47:32] everything will be perfect in the
[1:47:34] rapture
[1:47:35] we're not just beyond the clouds we're
[1:47:37] just stepping off through the cumulus
[1:47:39] and suddenly God says you're you're good
[1:47:43] go ahead and go
[1:47:44] one moment it's like whoa nope go ahead
[1:47:46] and go
[1:47:47] no sir
[1:47:49] God's going to have declared you and I
[1:47:51] well it's not this flesh it's not going
[1:47:52] to be perfect it's what God declared of
[1:47:54] you and I they're perfect they're ready
[1:47:56] to go it's there but the prophet sees us
[1:47:59] now every nation in their own language
[1:48:04] own clothes own dress
[1:48:09] you can't tell me my brother and sister
[1:48:11] some of the preaching we have here in
[1:48:13] the United States is ineffective in
[1:48:15] other places
[1:48:18] oh did you guys not know that
[1:48:21] maybe we should take you with us when we
[1:48:23] go places
[1:48:24] even within a country from church to
[1:48:27] church you have to preach different
[1:48:29] some Churches not ours but churches like
[1:48:31] ours have complexes
[1:48:34] and sometimes that complex actually
[1:48:36] comes from the pastor
[1:48:38] and it comes right down in the church
[1:48:39] and you come there and you have to
[1:48:41] preach in a certain way because if you
[1:48:43] say certain things are maybe too
[1:48:45] aggressive the people are like
[1:48:48] why because they've been beaten by a
[1:48:50] previous Pastor or Ministry and every
[1:48:52] time somebody hmm
[1:48:56] mine's made of a little kid one time the
[1:48:58] dad was talking about his kid and how he
[1:49:00] believes in discipline but you know he
[1:49:01] doesn't strike his kid and his son comes
[1:49:03] walking up about the time hey Dad and
[1:49:05] the dad turns and the kid's like
[1:49:09] and then the dad is like no honestly I
[1:49:11] don't beat my kid
[1:49:16] so you have to deal with them
[1:49:18] amen
[1:49:19] sorry for wasting your time but
[1:49:21] it was a time when God anointed open a
[1:49:23] door for me to preach in a Thunder's
[1:49:25] Church in Chile
[1:49:27] I'm there I'm shocked the brothers Still
[1:49:31] doing
[1:49:32] my wife sitting in the audience going my
[1:49:34] goodness his spirit's got on my husband
[1:49:37] I mean it's not really that weird is it
[1:49:39] for the preacher to stand on the front
[1:49:41] row and preach to you
[1:49:44] most of you would consider that normal
[1:49:46] if brother Paul stood right here and
[1:49:48] preached to you
[1:49:51] my wife is like oh my God
[1:49:54] but you know it caught their attention
[1:49:58] because that's what they were used to
[1:50:00] that kind of stuff
[1:50:01] only while I was standing on the front
[1:50:03] row it was a metal chair actually it was
[1:50:06] interesting because it was a tile floor
[1:50:08] and as I'm preaching the cherish
[1:50:15] and God did a supernatural work not Paul
[1:50:18] God did in that church they come back
[1:50:20] out of the thunder so realize you can
[1:50:21] have a life
[1:50:23] without having a doctrine that doesn't
[1:50:26] line up
[1:50:27] life my brother and sister and we can be
[1:50:30] dressed in this word without having to
[1:50:33] become weird
[1:50:36] hmm
[1:50:38] yeah
[1:50:39] or do we want to be weird
[1:50:42] we won't even go there
[1:50:46] some of this can be weird without trying
[1:50:48] amen sister Ruth why don't you just come
[1:50:51] hey man
[1:50:53] Hallelujah look they seen the coming of
[1:50:57] the kingdom of God rehearsed and they

[1:51:14] preview the amen the rehearsal of a
[1:51:17] bride coming and what is he showing us

[1:51:50] remember this is the rehearsal and when
[1:51:52] we make a mistake it is not going to
[1:51:55] change the Rapture it will be that God
[1:51:58] will send us an order he will correct us
[1:52:00] he will bring us in the right place even
[1:52:02] if he has to take us right back and we
[1:52:04] have to go through some things all over
