[35:17] to be able to come together once again
[35:20] we would certainly prefer to be here
[35:23] joined together you know just a bit of
[35:26] humor the scripture says that we are one
[35:29] body in Christ I thought maybe we could
[35:33] all just go ahead and have Church and
[35:34] when the authorities come we just tell
[35:36] them sorry there's only one here amen
[35:39] but you know we miss you and God bless
[35:43] you each and every one praying that the
[35:45] Lord just comes right down in your home
[35:48] where you're at today those that might
[35:51] listen to it and the days following may
[35:54] God just be with you this morning as I
[35:58] was finishing up my thought just a few
[36:01] little things sister Jerry was singing
[36:04] the song she just sang as a special and
[36:06] I thought how fitting that was and so I
[36:09] had asked her after the fact I said are
[36:12] you gonna sing a special today and she
[36:15] said yes and so I thought that was
[36:17] beautiful
[36:18] a lot of little things come together for
[36:20] me today
[36:22] you know I'll touch on it in a minute
[36:24] just how certain little elements come
[36:27] together and they encourage you and I
[36:29] pray today that the Holy Spirit just
[36:31] comes right down in your home all the
[36:34] elements that there are that make up the
[36:37] life of a son or daughter of God they're
[36:40] already in us right the prophet of God
[36:42] said that everything we need to make the
[36:45] rapture is already in us so I'm just
[36:48] praying today God just opens it up and
[36:50] reveals it to us let's it loose amen
[36:53] thank you brother Jason's sister Emmy
[36:54] brother Shawn sure appreciate their
[36:57] their contribution to the service it
[37:00] would not be the same without it amen I
[37:02] would like to speak to you today on the
[37:05] title focused we spoke to you last week
[37:09] on a distraction and we want to just
[37:13] balance that today on focused amen now
[37:17] let's just stand and turn in our Bibles
[37:19] to first Corinthians the fifteenth
[37:22] chapter you know it's just a lot of
[37:26] lovely thing
[37:26] things in the Word of God things that
[37:28] stir our hearts reminders you might say
[37:31] to us of how God is working for our
[37:34] benefit and that we as sons and
[37:36] daughters of God are living out the
[37:39] greatest privilege that has been given
[37:42] to man 1st Corinthians 15:51 behold I
[37:48] show you a mystery we shall not all
[37:50] sleep but we shall all be changed in a
[37:55] moment in the twinkling of an eye at the
[37:58] last Trump for the trumpet shall sound
[38:00] and the dead shall be raised
[38:02] incorruptible and we shall be changed
[38:06] this always just stirs or bubbles
[38:08] something up within my heart amen
[38:10] for this corruptible must put on
[38:13] incorruption and this mortal must put on
[38:16] immortality so when this corruptible
[38:19] shall have put on incorruption and this
[38:22] mortal shall have put on immortality
[38:24] then shall be brought to pass the saying
[38:27] that is written death is swallowed up in
[38:30] victory Oh death where is thy sting o
[38:34] grave where is thy victory the sting of
[38:38] death is sin and the strength of sin is
[38:40] the law but thanks be to God can we say
[38:45] amen to that we just give a Thanksgiving
[38:47] to the Lord but thanks be to God which
[38:50] giveth us the victory through our Lord
[38:53] Jesus Christ therefore my beloved
[38:56] brethren be steadfast unmovable always
[38:59] abounding in the work of the Lord for as
[39:02] much as you know what your labor is not
[39:04] in vain in the Lord amen I want to read
[39:08] that last verse again therefore my
[39:10] beloved brethren be ye stedfast that's
[39:14] stable and pressing forward unmovable
[39:18] always abounding in the work of the Lord
[39:21] for as much as you know that your labor
[39:24] is not in vain in the Lord Heavenly
[39:28] Father we ask Lord for your blessings
[39:30] upon this service today
[39:32] father just pray is we would proceed
[39:35] today father that you would just reach
[39:37] out into the homes of the believers of
[39:39] the Saints in
[39:40] father you would just stir hearts and
[39:43] Lord just remind us father Oh Lord it's
[39:47] not as though we have reached a place we
[39:50] don't need more of you but Lord as the
[39:53] scripture so clearly shows us sometimes
[39:55] we just need our minds stirred up father
[39:58] I pray that you would stir us today help
[40:01] us father to do and to live and to be
[40:04] all that you have called us to be in the
[40:06] name of Jesus Christ amen
[40:08] you may be seated so as we look at this
[40:15] as I have said here this lovely
[40:17] scripture to me is very encouraging
[40:19] because as I read this scripture my
[40:22] brother and sister I take what brother
[40:23] Branham said that spoke to us encouraged
[40:26] us to do and and I I read myself into
[40:30] every portion of scripture and so as
[40:34] it's there well I say every portion now
[40:36] those that are gonna be bound and thrown
[40:38] in the pit I don't identify with them
[40:40] amen but here it is you know my beloved
[40:43] brother and he's talking to me stalking
[40:45] to you yeah you know be steadfast
[40:48] unmovable now we always want to be in a
[40:51] position that the Holy Spirit moves us
[40:53] but we understand what he is saying here
[40:55] that we wouldn't be moved around we
[40:58] wouldn't be shuffled as it were we're
[41:00] not pawns on a board amen so we always
[41:03] want to be abounding in the work of the
[41:05] Lord we don't want to you know Excel one
[41:08] day and fail the next but we want to
[41:10] just always be pressing forward so we
[41:13] know that our labor is not in vain
[41:15] to me that is very very encouraging amen
[41:19] what our Bibles are full of wonderful
[41:22] examples and you can just read passage
[41:25] after passage after passage and you will
[41:28] see the Bible is written in such a way
[41:31] to encourage the believer to to lift him
[41:36] up to correct him but my brother and
[41:38] sisters so many wonderful examples just
[41:40] as this scripture is to me the
[41:43] continuity of the word what they're
[41:45] doing it's always pointing us to our
[41:47] position in Jesus Christ so the believer
[41:51] my brother and sister can read the Bible
[41:53] by a supernatural I guess you would say
[41:56] anointing the believer reads the Bible
[41:59] recognizes those portions of Scripture
[42:01] and how they pertain to their life and
[42:04] in that when they recognize that they
[42:07] start to claim that as it were they
[42:09] start to pull these in and and it
[42:12] becomes part of them you know not
[42:14] everybody takes vitamins but you know as
[42:17] you would take a vitamin if you need
[42:18] vitamin C my brother and sister you will
[42:21] will have a craving your body will
[42:24] desire that and you know your body then
[42:27] benefits when you take that in remember
[42:30] this story the prophet of God speaks
[42:31] about the child that needed sulfur and
[42:34] come to the place that he's eating the
[42:37] petal off of a bicycle because there was
[42:39] something brother branham types is to
[42:41] the deep calling to the deep but there
[42:43] was something in that boy recognized
[42:45] that he needed something that was in
[42:47] that pedal of that bicycle and so here
[42:51] we are this morning as sons and
[42:53] daughters of God recognizing what there
[42:56] is in our life that we have need of you
[42:58] say well brother Paul I don't always
[42:59] know well my brother and sister you
[43:02] might say that it's kind of subliminal
[43:03] you know you'll start reading the word
[43:06] and it will just stir your heart up and
[43:08] you'll say amen to it and you'll find
[43:10] out later in some portion of your life
[43:12] then that was a portion you needed at
[43:15] that time and so he's always pointing us
[43:17] to our position in Christ and the
[43:19] unfailing promises of God I believe
[43:22] Saints today if we could just recognize
[43:25] and just get anchored in the fact that
[43:27] God has made unfailing promises to us it
[43:31] is not as though that it will work one
[43:33] day and doesn't work the next the only
[43:35] thing my brother and sister that might
[43:37] be a limiting factor would be our own
[43:39] acceptance of the promise to act upon it
[43:43] but we look at this and realize my
[43:45] brother and sister as we claim our
[43:47] position as we long for the deep is
[43:51] calling to the deep as we long for that
[43:53] God has made a promise that he would
[43:56] give to us and see what we need amen and
[44:00] so as we see that we start to become
[44:02] partakers of it and it changes our life
[44:05] and as I said already we spoke last week
[44:07] on being distracted and certainly
[44:10] distraction is a great tactic for the
[44:13] enemy it doesn't matter whether you're
[44:15] talking carnal warfare my brother and
[44:17] sister or you're talking in the
[44:19] spiritual element that if one can keep
[44:21] the enemy distracted my brother and
[44:24] sister you say well brother Paula I
[44:26] don't know how would I distract the
[44:28] devil pray amen there is the thing that
[44:31] changes the whole atmosphere the prophet
[44:34] of God tell us it changes everything my
[44:37] brother and sister so if the devil is
[44:39] trying to focus on something you might
[44:41] say well a flaw or however you'd like to
[44:44] describe it Satan's trying to focus on
[44:47] that in your life and you keep praying
[44:49] you stay under the blood you stay humble
[44:51] applying the word to your life you see
[44:54] what that does is distract Satan because
[44:56] he's got to find a way to get through
[44:58] the word to you and if you are
[45:00] constantly in the word under the blood
[45:02] then he then is the one who has the
[45:06] issue to struggle with amen
[45:08] so we don't want to give in to the
[45:11] Satan's into the enemy's tactics because
[45:14] oftentimes they will draw you out and
[45:16] that's been one of the greatest things
[45:18] in warfare of mankind would be to draw
[45:21] someone to push into a perceived place
[45:25] that they can conquer only to be
[45:28] encircled and so Satan were trying to
[45:31] draw sons and daughters of God out my
[45:34] brother and sister now look his whole
[45:37] goal his tactic is to get the bride of
[45:39] Jesus Christ caught up in the
[45:41] distractions of our age and there is a
[45:44] lot of distractions we're not going to
[45:45] reap reach that sermon but there's a lot
[45:47] of distractions that we get caught up in
[45:51] that are perfectly natural but we can
[45:53] get caught up too much you know the
[45:55] prophet of God says you can do almost
[45:57] anything too much you just can't pray
[45:59] too much amen so you know we're not like
[46:01] focusing on one particular thing but to
[46:04] realize it is a human tendency to get
[46:07] caught up in something and to really
[46:09] press into that and it can be a
[46:11] distraction to what a real purpose is
[46:14] now maybe I could give this to families
[46:17] with children maybe just to the
[46:20] Church in general it's almost you might
[46:23] say like a Sunday School lesson in a way
[46:25] but to go back to your Bible and go back
[46:29] to Goshen go back to the time that
[46:32] pharaoh finally relents and says that
[46:35] he's going to let Israel go and he's
[46:38] releasing them and then a great spirit
[46:41] of confidence come upon Israel and they
[46:44] went to their neighbors they went to
[46:46] those around them and demanded of them
[46:49] for oxen and carts and food and all of
[46:52] this and a spirit was on Egypt at that
[46:54] time and they readily gave of their pots
[46:57] and their pans and all of this to the
[46:59] Israelites now my brother and sister a
[47:01] conquering people giving to the
[47:04] conquered is unreasonable so you
[47:07] recognize it was a move of God that come
[47:10] upon them and so the people come out of
[47:13] Goshen and start to the promised land
[47:15] and they come out and started with a
[47:17] great zeal a great a great awakening and
[47:22] you might say and singing songs of
[47:24] praise and of worship and I like for you
[47:27] to go back into your Bible and look very
[47:29] carefully and count up the distractions
[47:32] that Israel faced on their journey from
[47:35] Egypt to Kadesh Barnea you will see over
[47:38] and over and over again things come up
[47:41] before them now my brother and sister
[47:44] maybe people would have a slightly
[47:45] different idea on this than I do I not
[47:48] trying to make a doctrine but my brother
[47:50] and sister I am a firm believer that if
[47:53] Israel had come to the Red Sea and had
[47:56] said well God said that nothing would
[47:58] stand before us and they had just walked
[48:01] right out into the Red Sea it would have
[48:03] opened before them at that very moment
[48:05] but because there already were weary now
[48:09] remember this is a journey that their
[48:11] oxen did not die it is a journey that
[48:13] their shoes did not wear out their
[48:15] clothes did not wear out but they did
[48:17] get tired and they did get hungry and
[48:20] they did get thirsty amen so it is not
[48:23] like they had a journey that was
[48:25] entirely free of distraction and
[48:28] circumstance but as they come just to to
[48:31] not be labored they come to the Red Sea
[48:33] here is
[48:34] the Egyptians behind them and here's the
[48:37] Red Sea before them and immediately
[48:40] you'll see some not all of Israel but
[48:42] some and as they raised their voices
[48:44] their voices were like the leaven in the
[48:47] bread and they raised their voice and
[48:48] said you've brought us out here to die
[48:51] we would that we were still back in
[48:53] Egypt and so this started or laid the
[48:56] groundwork of the distraction that every
[48:59] time their spiritual walk got difficult
[49:03] they started looking backwards instead
[49:05] of looking forward to the promise of God
[49:07] making a claim to the promise
[49:10] imagine Saints if we could come in our
[49:12] lives and walk right up to whatever our
[49:15] circumstance is and say you know God
[49:18] promised me a way through this and I'm
[49:20] standing on that promise I may not see
[49:22] the promise today I may not see it
[49:25] tomorrow but God said it and I believe
[49:27] it and we would simply walk forward
[49:30] right as the prophet of God so
[49:31] beautifully brought this out to us
[49:33] footsteps our possession and so as we
[49:37] would step into that we were actually
[49:39] telling God I believe your promise amen
[49:43] so as you see this may be a little
[49:45] homework for you parents for whoever
[49:47] would like to embrace it just go through
[49:50] and look at the distractions Amen I have
[49:54] a yearning to start touching on those
[49:56] but we won't for the sake of time amen
[50:00] the distractions you might say well it
[50:03] wore down these distractions wore down
[50:05] the people's faith they had all of these
[50:09] challenges that come they come to the
[50:10] place that they didn't even trust God's
[50:13] prophet they come to the place they
[50:16] questioned what the Prophet said in his
[50:18] motive for saying it because it seemed
[50:20] as though God treated Moses differently
[50:24] than he treated them but you see Moses
[50:26] was still doing his very best to stand
[50:29] upon the Word of God even though he got
[50:31] discouraged went up to the mountain
[50:33] spoke to God said look God these people
[50:35] that you give me to lead here who are
[50:38] they what are they and I really don't
[50:39] want anything to do with him but you
[50:41] look at what God was doing God was
[50:43] bringing it to the place that it was the
[50:46] people's faith that had to
[50:48] expressed it could not be their faith in
[50:51] the Prophet it could not be their faith
[50:53] in the great men that led them but it
[50:55] had to be their personal faith in
[50:58] Jehovah that kept them going or pressing
[51:01] forward and so as you see it started to
[51:04] wear down the people's faith and it
[51:06] brought them to a place at Kadish Barnea
[51:09] this is kind of where I kind of cut this
[51:11] off because you see here kadish marnya
[51:14] was one of the greatest distractions
[51:16] there ever was and that was here are the
[51:19] 12 spies 12 ministers they're pressing
[51:21] into the land and in the land that they
[51:24] are seeing everything that was promised
[51:27] to them the land was flowing with milk
[51:28] and honey
[51:29] the land was there but the land also
[51:32] possessed Giants in it and so it all
[51:35] depended upon what that minister looked
[51:38] at as what kind of report he brought
[51:41] back to the people so if the minister
[51:44] spent his time looking at the Giants and
[51:47] the vastness of the land and deciding
[51:50] this land was too great to be conquered
[51:52] by mere mortals then that was the
[51:54] testimony that when he come back from
[51:57] going into the land and come before the
[51:59] people at Kadesh Barnea the minister my
[52:03] brother and sister I hope you catch this
[52:05] the minister was preaching his own
[52:09] conviction he was preaching the message
[52:13] as he saw it now my brother and sister
[52:16] if one wants to say well I I don't see
[52:19] this I don't see that well that's good
[52:22] but if it's not God's Word for the hour
[52:25] the minister ought to just keep silent
[52:27] because the word is very clear when it
[52:30] declares what will happen and when it
[52:33] will happen God doesn't always clearly
[52:35] show us how it will happen other than it
[52:38] will be the manifesting of his word amen
[52:41] so I don't need to know how I will be an
[52:44] overcomer tomorrow all I've got to do is
[52:46] stand on the promise that God said I am
[52:49] an overcomer and I say I believe I'm an
[52:52] overcomer certainly my own family you
[52:54] know they would see my weaknesses
[52:56] they'll see my frustrations they'll see
[52:58] this but I hope they see also my faith
[53:01] in
[53:02] God's Word hey man I hope that that is
[53:04] not absent so you look at this my
[53:06] brother and sister we are seeing now how
[53:09] that they come to this place so weary so
[53:12] discouraged so influenced that they
[53:15] can't even say Amen to God's promise
[53:18] Joshua nailed you've heard this a
[53:20] million times but my brother and sister
[53:22] Joshua and Caleb
[53:23] they went over into the land they saw
[53:25] the same vastness of the land they saw
[53:27] the same Giants but we'll get to this
[53:30] you'll understand where I'm going I
[53:32] believe in just a few minutes but they
[53:34] were looking at this my brother and
[53:35] sister and there is a Giants there's the
[53:38] vastness of the land there is everything
[53:40] that was there but they viewed it
[53:42] through a different perspective they
[53:44] were looking through a different lens
[53:46] and that lens was not that they were
[53:48] super spiritual it's interesting in the
[53:51] day that we live in when one would have
[53:53] a victorious encounter when one would
[53:56] come to a place that the presence of God
[53:58] has so stirred them up and that they are
[54:01] just encouraged or trying to encourage
[54:03] the people to take a hold to the promise
[54:05] and press into it and people will then
[54:08] come back and say oh they sure think
[54:09] their spiritual my brother and sister
[54:12] know they have simply come to a place
[54:14] that they are looking at the promise of
[54:16] God through a different perspective they
[54:19] are not looking at it through their own
[54:21] carnal element they are looking at it
[54:24] through the word because the word is the
[54:26] thing that has become preeminent in
[54:29] their life and without that in their
[54:31] life they would be just like those other
[54:33] 10 ministers that are all bringing a
[54:36] reason we have it today people saying
[54:38] well you know there's things we don't
[54:39] understand about the message God's got
[54:41] to bring the profit back my brother and
[54:43] sister the Prophet said everything we
[54:45] need hallelujah we don't need another
[54:48] prophet to come the word has been
[54:51] revealed the prophet of God said that
[54:53] Jesus Christ is our prophet look it up
[54:55] amen so the Prophet is still with us the
[54:59] one that we have been looking to the one
[55:01] that we adore we praise we owe our life
[55:04] to is still right here with us
[55:08] hallelujah we don't need to have God's
[55:10] messenger to the aged come back because
[55:12] we have amen the great prophet message
[55:16] Jesus Christ now you look at this and
[55:18] realize my brother and sister when
[55:19] people come to the place that they
[55:21] cannot even say amen to the Word of God
[55:23] you know they say well men has failed us
[55:26] this is that that is that the pastor
[55:28] said something I didn't understand and
[55:30] I'm weary of him now well look at this
[55:32] my brother and sister Moses with just a
[55:34] mouthpiece and God said when Moses
[55:37] speaks to you it is the same as me
[55:39] speaking to you and so we have to come
[55:42] down you'll judge one way or another
[55:43] whether you want to believe God's
[55:45] mouthpiece whether you want to believe a
[55:47] fivefold ministry whether you whatever
[55:50] it's up to you my brother and sister but
[55:52] you'll find if you don't look beyond
[55:54] those things you will then constantly
[55:57] find yourself looking at the perceived
[56:00] circumstance you will look at what you
[56:02] think what the problem is and you will
[56:05] not be looking for God's solution amen
[56:08] now if God promised to put you and I in
[56:10] a rapture God promised to take you and I
[56:13] to the other side amen
[56:15] to reward us with this glorious time in
[56:17] his presence of eternity my brother and
[56:20] sister and if you cannot see that God
[56:23] has got a solution to get you there then
[56:26] you have missed something
[56:28] amen just reading report where brother
[56:30] Branham says so many people don't really
[56:32] have a true revelation of the Godhead
[56:35] because if they did they would look at
[56:37] these things entirely different my
[56:40] brother and sister I don't know how it's
[56:42] going to happen
[56:43] I look at this old flesh right here and
[56:45] I trying to put it to the scripture that
[56:48] I just read to you and sometimes I have
[56:51] a hard time reconciling that but one
[56:53] thing that you might find is a kind of
[56:56] odd to you I don't know maybe you're in
[56:58] the same position but something that I
[57:00] find that I just simply have to say Lord
[57:03] your words said it and I believe I'm a
[57:05] son of God and so I don't know how this
[57:08] is going to come to pass but it will and
[57:10] I'm going to stand here until it comes
[57:13] to pass it will come to pass and I
[57:15] declare this morning it will be come to
[57:17] pass in me hallelujah if you'll take
[57:20] that you'll come to pass in you too amen
[57:23] so we want to not look at our
[57:25] circumstance we want to look for God's
[57:27] provided solution now look my
[57:29] sister these people who come down and
[57:32] walked in the wilderness for forty years
[57:34] they died imagine the young people how
[57:37] it must have been so hard for them
[57:40] because they now are watching all of
[57:43] their relatives including maybe their
[57:45] parents and they're walking through the
[57:47] wilderness for this forty years and um
[57:50] they're dying right and left they're
[57:52] starting to question where was the
[57:54] promise of the promised land but you see
[57:56] God did not take the promise of the
[57:58] promised land from them they rejected or
[58:01] refuse to accept the promise remember
[58:05] what brother Brown said about a pardon I
[58:07] meant in the civil war a partner is not
[58:09] a pardon until it's accepted amen until
[58:12] it's received as a pardon a promise of
[58:15] God is not a promise of God to you until
[58:18] you reach out and accept it until you
[58:21] lay claim to it
[58:22] otherwise God spoke but it must not have
[58:24] been to you amen so look Saints I
[58:27] believe we are sons and daughters of God
[58:29] I believe we are the Bride of Christ
[58:31] don't let your circumstance amen keep
[58:34] you from accepting God's promise for
[58:37] your life amen now look when you think
[58:41] about it we think about things that are
[58:42] stolen we think about things that are
[58:45] that are pulled away from us things that
[58:47] don't seem to come the way we thought
[58:49] they were you see the promise of God was
[58:52] stolen from them big of group it is
[58:56] they're all coming together saying yep
[58:58] yep we're in unity we stand together on
[59:01] this that yep the land is there the
[59:03] grapes are there the weed is there
[59:05] everything is there but the Giants are
[59:07] there also and that becomes their
[59:09] ministry now become their ministry we
[59:12] can have a good life here we can worship
[59:13] in church expect the Holy Ghost to
[59:16] change your life don't expect to be
[59:18] filled up and be turned into a different
[59:20] person don't expect that old nature well
[59:22] we're I were through this or we're then
[59:24] don't expect that to go away we're just
[59:27] here to take know my brother and sister
[59:29] there's a word that come that said
[59:31] there's a land there's a promise there's
[59:33] a river and it's yours if you will stand
[59:36] up and pursue it oh but I'm gonna sit
[59:39] here until God does something well
[59:41] you'll just sit there a long time
[59:42] amen
[59:44] be the Rip Van Winkle Rip Van Winkle
[59:47] yeah Rip Van Winkle of church because
[59:51] you'll sit there a long long time and
[59:54] God won't do anything and you'll get up
[59:55] and walk away one day and say sure
[59:57] enough I set in grace Tabernacle for
[59:59] years and nothing happened there
[1:00:02] well I'm sorry you might look over there
[1:00:04] at that one that you looked down at and
[1:00:06] thought well they just act so spiritual
[1:00:08] you're gonna look over at them and
[1:00:09] you're gonna think well they're still
[1:00:10] acting so spiritual but what they're
[1:00:12] doing is having a jubilee because the
[1:00:15] promises of God are coming to pass in
[1:00:18] their life Oh hallelujah I know some of
[1:00:21] this kind of hurts but you know Saints
[1:00:23] sometimes maybe this is good there's
[1:00:25] only a little handful of faces looking
[1:00:26] back at me and so I don't have to deal
[1:00:29] with the frowns and whatever and the
[1:00:32] people going to sleep so I don't know
[1:00:34] maybe this is the new way to have church
[1:00:37] Alleluia some of you might be at home
[1:00:39] right now if your bunny slippers on
[1:00:41] comfortable when we wouldn't know if you
[1:00:44] went to sleep or not I hope not I hope
[1:00:47] not oh and those of you that didn't like
[1:00:49] that please get a sense of humor
[1:00:52] now look here what was stolen from them
[1:00:55] my brother and sister was actually a
[1:00:57] promise but it literally was at the tip
[1:01:01] of their tongue it wasn't at the tip of
[1:01:04] the profit it wasn't at the tip of the
[1:01:06] great men and the message it was at the
[1:01:08] tip of their tongue all they had to do
[1:01:11] was agree and acknowledge what Joshua
[1:01:14] and Caleb said they just needed to focus
[1:01:16] not on Joshua not on Caleb they needed
[1:01:19] to focus this is a promise from God
[1:01:23] there's where they got off their focus
[1:01:25] they started looking at Moses and all of
[1:01:27] the men and they started looking at what
[1:01:29] if it would have been my brother and
[1:01:31] sister of those people standing there
[1:01:33] that day would have been so focused upon
[1:01:35] God's Word God's promised to them so
[1:01:38] focused on that that when the first of
[1:01:41] those ten spies got up and said the
[1:01:42] lands flowing with milk and honey it's
[1:01:44] everything he said it would be but
[1:01:46] somebody would have said that's not in
[1:01:48] the word oh my it might have been
[1:01:53] contagious you know sometimes have
[1:01:55] they're so worried about how contagious
[1:01:57] this
[1:01:57] iris is my brother and sister I think
[1:01:59] sometimes we need something a little
[1:02:01] contagious maybe we need somebody that
[1:02:03] have a little Jubilee in church and
[1:02:05] stand up and just have the gumption to
[1:02:06] say praise the Lord and the bride oh
[1:02:09] that's how to order well I don't know if
[1:02:12] it is or not
[1:02:13] hallelujah depending on your reaction
[1:02:15] some of you they didn't like what they
[1:02:17] did would be the ones actually out of
[1:02:19] order because you'd be over there if it
[1:02:20] was up to me I'd throw them out in the
[1:02:22] parking lot right now come on my brother
[1:02:24] and sister we got to look at what God
[1:02:26] promised not this circumstance of all
[1:02:29] this somebody needed on their debt that
[1:02:31] day it Kadish Barnea somebody needed to
[1:02:34] have the courage to stand up and say you
[1:02:36] know what they didn't put a butt in that
[1:02:39] promise that God gave to Moses and Moses
[1:02:41] brought to us they didn't put any butts
[1:02:43] in there so we don't have to look at
[1:02:46] what it is that is holding us back
[1:02:47] amen so you look here now I love this my
[1:02:51] brother and sister once again I want to
[1:02:52] reiterate this what was stolen from them
[1:02:54] wasn't stolen from them from their
[1:02:56] fingertips it was stolen from them from
[1:02:59] the tip of their tongue because all they
[1:03:01] had to do is speak out the word to
[1:03:03] accept this now I love this I my brother
[1:03:07] Sergei sent this to me this morning and
[1:03:10] it was encouraging to me and the message
[1:03:13] I know Amen if we look at this and just
[1:03:15] see this read this here with me and why
[1:03:18] does God let troubles come God harness
[1:03:23] is trouble see that's not most of our
[1:03:25] point of view most of us trouble takes
[1:03:28] control of us trouble controls our
[1:03:30] emotion trouble controls our reaction
[1:03:33] trouble controls our thoughts but look
[1:03:35] what brother Branham says here and why
[1:03:37] does God let troubles come god harnesses
[1:03:40] trouble puts bits in its mouth and makes
[1:03:42] it obey Him and those troubles bring us
[1:03:45] into a closer fellowship with God amen
[1:03:49] so it's all depends our focus my brother
[1:03:52] and sister on how we view trouble we can
[1:03:55] get up and say Oh trouble I've got
[1:03:57] trouble on the ride I've got trouble on
[1:03:59] the Left there's trouble in the land
[1:04:00] there's trouble here there's trouble in
[1:04:02] my workplace there's trouble trouble
[1:04:03] trouble
[1:04:04] well how about you sit back and let God
[1:04:06] put a bit in that troubles mouth and
[1:04:08] then
[1:04:09] have it come to affect you that instead
[1:04:12] of sitting there in your house paralyzed
[1:04:14] not praying not praising not lifting
[1:04:17] hands to the Lord Amen my brother and
[1:04:20] sister how about you let God put the bit
[1:04:21] in the mouth of that and you sit back
[1:04:23] and say praise the Lord
[1:04:25] something good is going to come from
[1:04:27] this I remember many years ago a brother
[1:04:29] lost his job and people were concerned
[1:04:32] because the brother had a you know
[1:04:33] fairly well paying job and the company
[1:04:36] sold out and they didn't need those
[1:04:38] departments because they were redundant
[1:04:40] to the new company and and people said
[1:04:42] you know what are you gonna do brother
[1:04:43] this seems like this is just a disaster
[1:04:45] for you and the brother had caught a
[1:04:47] revelation my brother and sister now
[1:04:49] whether he saw it as being a bit put it
[1:04:51] in the mouth of this trouble but he said
[1:04:54] well praise the Lord if God I let this
[1:04:57] job be taken from me he's got a better
[1:05:00] job for me waiting amen and it was only
[1:05:04] a couple weeks later the brother had a
[1:05:06] job and it was much more you might say
[1:05:09] friendly to to his activities of life
[1:05:12] and and paid better money and you know
[1:05:15] he testified of that not that he could
[1:05:18] come and gloat and say well this is what
[1:05:20] it is but that's what he believed he
[1:05:23] believed if God let this come that God
[1:05:25] had something better for him oh my oh my
[1:05:29] I'll tell you what I say this applies to
[1:05:31] the believer you know I remember years
[1:05:33] ago my brother and sister brothers in
[1:05:35] Chile sharing with me how that the
[1:05:38] circumstances a great earthquakes going
[1:05:40] back into the 60s and stuff and brothers
[1:05:42] shared to me how when they had that
[1:05:44] probably you know one of the rates I
[1:05:46] think is one of the worst earthquakes on
[1:05:48] the earth there and it just killed tens
[1:05:51] of thousands of people in Chile tsunami
[1:05:53] swept into the city buildings collapse
[1:05:56] people it was just a horrible time and
[1:05:59] brothers shared with me how that the
[1:06:01] churches filled up full of people people
[1:06:04] in the plaza which is kind of like the
[1:06:06] city center part and people in the plaza
[1:06:08] crying out to God for mercy crying out
[1:06:11] to God that he would come on their
[1:06:13] behalf and and so as they cried out but
[1:06:16] over time another disaster hits Chile
[1:06:18] and people cry out they go to church
[1:06:21] they cry out to the Lord but it's
[1:06:23] than before another disaster people cry
[1:06:26] out less than before until the last
[1:06:28] earthquake which was here in my years
[1:06:31] fly 2010 I guess sister Jerry and I just
[1:06:34] just a few short days before that
[1:06:37] earthquake then had got on a plane
[1:06:38] walked through the very airport that the
[1:06:40] ceilings collapsed in and different
[1:06:42] things and and so is really close to
[1:06:44] home to us I don't remember if that was
[1:06:47] a time that we were even sleeping in
[1:06:49] saint's home and earthquake put pressure
[1:06:51] on the house enough that the doors
[1:06:53] started unlatching and flying open and
[1:06:56] slamming against the walls but my
[1:06:57] brother and sister in 2010 they walked
[1:07:02] into the streets but they walked into
[1:07:05] the streets to curse God you see the
[1:07:08] shift that is taking place so much
[1:07:11] trouble so much struggle so much so much
[1:07:14] so much and the people's faith in God
[1:07:16] declined to where now it's almost
[1:07:19] non-existent in fact just to throw this
[1:07:22] in we see how the prophet of God said
[1:07:25] that they would come a time they would
[1:07:27] be a place that you would not even be
[1:07:28] allowed to preach the gospel without a
[1:07:30] permit and we saw that happen also in
[1:07:33] Chile where brothers have been there in
[1:07:34] the plaza with their little speaker and
[1:07:37] their little mic and they're sharing the
[1:07:39] message and they come along and tell
[1:07:41] them you don't have a permit you can't
[1:07:43] do this and the brothers point out and
[1:07:45] say but they're doing it they're doing
[1:07:47] it they're doing it and they would tell
[1:07:48] them they have a permit and he said
[1:07:50] where do we go to get a permit and the
[1:07:52] man looked him in the face I believe
[1:07:53] this was assistant mayor he looked them
[1:07:56] in the face and says we'll never grant
[1:07:57] you a permit you see so that persecution
[1:08:01] coming where every voice can be heard
[1:08:03] but the voice of truth oh my my brother
[1:08:06] and sister people don't like the voice
[1:08:08] we talk around the message we talk about
[1:08:11] the voice we talk about the voice but
[1:08:13] we're going to talk about the voice
[1:08:14] right here in a met in a minute my
[1:08:16] brother and sister and oftentimes people
[1:08:18] don't really like the voice now brother
[1:08:21] Branham preaches or speaks right here
[1:08:23] and Christ identified the same in all
[1:08:25] generations I think the title right
[1:08:27] there says a lot you see Laodicea we
[1:08:30] can't have a whole different approach to
[1:08:33] God it's got to find continuity to the
[1:08:36] god of the first church age all the way
[1:08:39] to our age now brother Brown says right
[1:08:42] here now the biggest robbery that ever
[1:08:44] had in the world was them seven million
[1:08:46] dollar robbery just done in England it
[1:08:48] was done by false lights they put lights
[1:08:51] out there and slowed that train down and
[1:08:53] even Scotland Yard's couldn't find it
[1:08:55] they ultimately did find out who robbed
[1:08:57] it but anyway it was a greatest robbery
[1:08:59] ever had in world's history was done by
[1:09:01] a false light it's quite an interesting
[1:09:04] story maybe another homework deal for
[1:09:06] our our homeschooled I guess every kid
[1:09:09] is home-schooled right now anyway for
[1:09:12] another thing go study that it's it's a
[1:09:14] very interesting story how that they
[1:09:17] figured out they didn't need to blow up
[1:09:19] the train trestle they didn't need to
[1:09:21] block it with some large object all they
[1:09:23] needed to do was to put a light out
[1:09:26] there and that light indicated that
[1:09:28] train should stop amen so that red light
[1:09:32] on the track that the engineers would
[1:09:34] say well now what would this be we don't
[1:09:36] know anything about this but they're
[1:09:38] going to obey the red light because in
[1:09:41] history is showed when trains tried to
[1:09:43] occupy the same time and space it never
[1:09:47] has worked so they learned to stop on
[1:09:50] the red light so it's instinctively
[1:09:53] engrained into the engineer of the train
[1:09:56] when he sees a red light he stops they
[1:09:58] stopped the train they robbed it but
[1:10:00] here look at this paragraph 122 and the
[1:10:05] greatest robbery that the Church of
[1:10:07] Jesus Christ ever had is a false light a
[1:10:10] glare of some other age when God is
[1:10:13] trying to inject or project to the
[1:10:16] people the light of the hour amen so we
[1:10:21] can't get caught up it's nice I love my
[1:10:23] brother and sister quotes her Spurgeon
[1:10:25] and tozer and many of those men of old
[1:10:28] beautiful quotes but we have message
[1:10:31] people lifting those up trying to apply
[1:10:33] Spurgeon's message that age that time
[1:10:36] that anointing as though it was
[1:10:39] pertinent in a complete and tire form to
[1:10:42] our day my brother and sister that's
[1:10:43] good read them study them but don't let
[1:10:46] them replace the light for your day
[1:10:48] don't let this change
[1:10:50] light of the hour because if we start to
[1:10:53] focus too much we can go back and my
[1:10:56] brother and sister and start looking
[1:10:57] through the dark ages we can start
[1:10:59] looking through all those times we can
[1:11:01] look in the Philadelphian age that you
[1:11:03] might say the greatest enlightenment of
[1:11:05] knowledge in man's history and you look
[1:11:07] at all of those it's all well and good
[1:11:09] and we take that as a portion to help
[1:11:12] build the platform by which we would
[1:11:14] live and stand and believe but the light
[1:11:17] of this hour is the light that is
[1:11:20] important the light of this hour because
[1:11:22] we can all go back I've got friends I've
[1:11:24] got family that think if they go back
[1:11:26] and they wear you know the clothes that
[1:11:29] the Israel was was commanded to wear and
[1:11:31] they eat what Israel was commanded to
[1:11:33] eat that somehow these promises would
[1:11:36] apply to them their Gentiles they've
[1:11:39] totally missed it they're not looking at
[1:11:40] the light of the hour they're looking
[1:11:42] backwards somewhere my brother and
[1:11:44] sister so as you look at this we realize
[1:11:46] that the light of the hour is what Satan
[1:11:49] is going to distract us from because if
[1:11:52] he can keep us from looking to the light
[1:11:54] of this hour this moment and keep us
[1:11:57] looking back now you say brother Paul
[1:11:59] what are you trying to imply I'm not
[1:12:01] trying to imply anything but I do know
[1:12:03] that the prophet of God said there was a
[1:12:05] become a time at the end of the
[1:12:07] Laodicean age that would be the bride
[1:12:09] age now he didn't place it as it would
[1:12:11] be a church age but it would be a time
[1:12:13] that the Word of God would enlighten the
[1:12:16] bride that she would be able to come in
[1:12:18] to faith we say well where's rapturing
[1:12:21] faith well God's pouring it into it wait
[1:12:23] it's already there he's pouring into you
[1:12:26] the anointing that releases the power
[1:12:29] that was already placed in you before
[1:12:31] the foundation of the world and in that
[1:12:33] you are starting to see things in the
[1:12:35] word that you never saw before you're
[1:12:37] starting to embrace a life that is you
[1:12:40] might say oh I don't even know how to
[1:12:42] put it be honest with you I want to use
[1:12:44] the word stricter but you see when you
[1:12:47] in force it on yourself it has to be
[1:12:53] your own free will it has to be
[1:12:56] something inside of you you know there's
[1:12:59] a doctor here in town very nice
[1:13:01] gentleman
[1:13:03] he told sister Jerry nine one time that
[1:13:06] the solution to a lot of our problems
[1:13:10] health-wise is uh it's what we eat and I
[1:13:14] have to agree with the Cheetos and Pepsi
[1:13:16] does not constitute a balanced diet but
[1:13:19] you know I asked him I says what do you
[1:13:21] eat for breakfast sir he said well I
[1:13:23] take a stone cut oats and I put him in a
[1:13:25] bowl and I pour he used various kinds of
[1:13:29] juices and stuff before and I pour it on
[1:13:32] them and I leave it sit in there
[1:13:33] overnight and then I eat it in the
[1:13:35] morning and I thought you know being
[1:13:37] unhealthy isn't all that bad my brother
[1:13:43] and sister but you see what it was I
[1:13:44] asked of us is how can you eat that and
[1:13:46] he said well it took me time to get used
[1:13:49] to it now I'm used to it you see my
[1:13:52] brother and sister maybe a poor analogy
[1:13:54] forgive me but you see this bride of
[1:13:57] Jesus Christ is not being forced to live
[1:14:01] the life she has changed she is not
[1:14:06] herself any longer she is becoming
[1:14:09] Christ in flesh some people struggle
[1:14:13] with that some people struggle with the
[1:14:15] idea God in flesh but don't pick a fight
[1:14:19] with me it's God's Word amen this is the
[1:14:23] mystery Christ in you the hope of glory
[1:14:26] going back to what the prophet of God
[1:14:28] said if we don't have a full revelation
[1:14:30] or a complete revelation of the Godhead
[1:14:33] we might question how can that be but my
[1:14:36] brother and sister it's God's Word God's
[1:14:38] prophets said it over and over again the
[1:14:40] scripture declares it all mine now look
[1:14:44] at this so we don't want to be faced
[1:14:45] today with the greatest robbery my
[1:14:47] brother and sister of the day that we
[1:14:49] live in because the word is here the
[1:14:51] word is available to us and we have been
[1:14:54] given every safeguard you say well how
[1:14:56] is this brother Paul that we have every
[1:14:58] safeguard well I'll touch on that in a
[1:15:00] service or two but my brother and sister
[1:15:02] all you got to do is go into the message
[1:15:04] take the search and type in searches
[1:15:07] like back to the scripture back to the
[1:15:10] word you know all of these kind of
[1:15:13] searches and you'll find that hundreds
[1:15:15] and hundreds of
[1:15:16] time's a prophet of God told us take it
[1:15:19] back to the Word of God now less that
[1:15:26] would be us misunderstood by some all
[1:15:30] I'm implying there's a prophet of God
[1:15:33] actually you say well we know brother
[1:15:35] branham's have indicated prophet why do
[1:15:36] we got to take it back to the word well
[1:15:38] good we're not proving brother branham's
[1:15:40] vindicated prophet maybe we're proving
[1:15:41] to you that you're vindicated believer
[1:15:43] and by taking it back to the word you
[1:15:46] start finding who you are and where you
[1:15:48] are in the Word of God you find your
[1:15:50] firm foundation that you don't have to
[1:15:52] take somebody else's word for it it's a
[1:15:54] problem we have too many young people
[1:15:55] too many children raised in the message
[1:15:57] without a personal experience they can
[1:15:59] sit there and say well the pastor says
[1:16:01] mom and dad says this minister says but
[1:16:04] it really comes down as Jesus was
[1:16:06] dealing them he says who do you say I am
[1:16:09] and it comes down to every single one of
[1:16:12] us has to be able to say that Jesus is
[1:16:15] the Christ and brother Branham shows us
[1:16:17] right in the Word of God he just
[1:16:20] amplifies or opens a word up my brother
[1:16:22] and sister we can't even say Jesus is
[1:16:24] the Christ without the Holy Ghost it's
[1:16:27] not even a correct interpretation or a
[1:16:29] correct manifestation if we're speaking
[1:16:32] at we can speak it with our words but to
[1:16:35] speak it from the heart you've got to
[1:16:36] have the Holy Ghost even to be able to
[1:16:38] speak to that oh my oh my
[1:16:41] now look letting off the pressure well
[1:16:51] let me back up a little bit you see in
[1:16:56] this greatest robbery my brother and
[1:16:58] sister the light of the hour which light
[1:17:03] which version there's dozens of versions
[1:17:07] I've been going to preach versions of
[1:17:09] the message for so long I I don't know
[1:17:11] I've wore it out just talking about it
[1:17:13] but my brother and sister is at version
[1:17:15] 1.0 1.3 1.7 you know how the computer
[1:17:18] thing is it goes right on man they have
[1:17:20] so many versions we have dozens of
[1:17:22] versions of the message and every one of
[1:17:24] them is saying you know what we we have
[1:17:28] it
[1:17:28] we're the ones
[1:17:29] got a right we were there see they're
[1:17:31] wrong we have this they don't have this
[1:17:33] we have this they have that and you know
[1:17:35] it was interesting brother jason de mars
[1:17:37] put it this way he said now you know
[1:17:39] he's reading and i'm take just snipping
[1:17:42] this out of what he was saying you know
[1:17:44] what it comes down to when you take what
[1:17:45] the Apostle Paul said the Apostle Paul
[1:17:47] said if you don't believe what I have
[1:17:48] preached to you you're you're lost you
[1:17:51] don't have it boy that's pretty strong I
[1:17:54] saying you got to come here and get it
[1:17:57] from us or from me the Apostle Paul
[1:18:00] spoke that strongly but you look at that
[1:18:02] that same anointing taking out my
[1:18:04] brother and sister dozens of versions of
[1:18:06] the message saying you've got to come to
[1:18:09] us to get it well I'm here to tell you
[1:18:11] my brother and sister you've got to come
[1:18:13] to the word to get it you don't got to
[1:18:16] come to a man or his movement to get it
[1:18:18] you've got to come back to the word and
[1:18:20] when you come back to the word God might
[1:18:22] lead you across the country to a certain
[1:18:24] ministry that would be there that would
[1:18:26] preach the word to satisfy your soul but
[1:18:28] you got to come to the word first
[1:18:30] because if you come to the man first and
[1:18:33] that man just has a version of the
[1:18:34] message then you will be following a
[1:18:36] version of the message but you know what
[1:18:38] in the midst of all of that
[1:18:40] amen could I sweep that under the rug in
[1:18:42] the midst of all of that there's a
[1:18:44] people that are not here to argue this
[1:18:46] message there's a people here to live it
[1:18:49] there's a people that are so focused on
[1:18:51] this word of God they're saying I am
[1:18:54] going to be the Bride of Christ
[1:18:56] I am the Bride of Christ I'm living the
[1:18:58] life this is who I am and they're not
[1:19:01] looking at all of this around they're
[1:19:02] not looking my brother and sister at
[1:19:05] manna and getting tired of the manna
[1:19:07] well we've got enough of the message oh
[1:19:09] my brother and sister that scares me
[1:19:11] when it comes from people's mouths we've
[1:19:13] got enough of the message I my brother
[1:19:17] and sister clearly identified this
[1:19:19] message as Jesus Christ and I could
[1:19:21] never say I've got enough of this
[1:19:23] message if you think this message is ink
[1:19:26] on a page of voice on a magnetic tape if
[1:19:29] you think this message is a religious
[1:19:31] following then you might come to the
[1:19:32] time that you can say I've got enough of
[1:19:35] this but when you recognize truly what
[1:19:38] this message is you cannot say I have
[1:19:41] enough of this message
[1:19:42] Oh hallelujah forgive me for being
[1:19:44] excited this morning hey man I'm not
[1:19:47] here to argue this message you take what
[1:19:49] you want to do brother Jordan Smith puts
[1:19:51] it this way you run your race and I'll
[1:19:53] run my race I'll meet you at the finish
[1:19:56] line
[1:19:57] hallelujah there it is not here to argue
[1:20:00] versions my brother and sister I'm here
[1:20:04] to run the race hey man I want to be one
[1:20:07] of those people that live it hallelujah
[1:20:10] now letting off the pressure brother
[1:20:12] Brown says here o Heavenly Father we're
[1:20:14] indeed a privileged people this morning
[1:20:16] in the face of this changing world wow
[1:20:18] this might be for us today Saints and we
[1:20:21] have a hold of the hand of the
[1:20:23] unchangeable God times may change but he
[1:20:26] is eternal and his word is in our heart
[1:20:28] it's an ultimate of our thoughts they
[1:20:32] always drift back to that word no matter
[1:20:35] where we stray it comes back to the word
[1:20:38] it's the typos in your heart we're so
[1:20:41] grateful for that you see my brother and
[1:20:44] sister what is he speaking of here when
[1:20:46] he's talking about the word now we have
[1:20:48] a great debate that is broke out over
[1:20:51] some time in the message of what is the
[1:20:53] absolute and and I understand what
[1:20:56] people are trying to say but not all
[1:20:58] people who say it say it in the same
[1:21:01] context and so it's there that if you're
[1:21:03] not careful of verbage can be put in
[1:21:06] that actually would take you or draw you
[1:21:08] pull your focus away now people would
[1:21:11] say now brother brother branham you know
[1:21:13] he preached the absolute my brother and
[1:21:16] sister some people are then saying well
[1:21:18] this message of the hour is our absolute
[1:21:21] well if you want to say it in the
[1:21:23] context that the message of the hour is
[1:21:25] Jesus Christ and Christ is the word then
[1:21:28] I'm with you but if you are believing
[1:21:30] that what brother Branham spoke with a
[1:21:32] man's voice and was put to a magnetic
[1:21:35] tape and ink to a page has become your
[1:21:38] absolute then you have missed that the
[1:21:40] prophet of God was pointing you beyond
[1:21:42] himself to Christ amen and so people say
[1:21:46] well well know how what my brother and
[1:21:49] sister it comes down simple you need to
[1:21:51] identify what you view the message at if
[1:21:55] you view the mess
[1:21:57] my brother and sister has a voice on
[1:22:00] magnetic tape and ink on a page and you
[1:22:03] say that your absolute I believe you
[1:22:06] missed it now you might want to argue
[1:22:08] with me I'm not gonna argue I'm not
[1:22:11] going to argue with you but this message
[1:22:13] is Jesus Christ and when Jesus Christ
[1:22:17] spoke as it were the anointed word Amen
[1:22:21] because all of the Bible wasn't written
[1:22:22] by man was written by God and so when a
[1:22:25] man comes to that it depends on what
[1:22:27] your focus is and when your focus is on
[1:22:30] Jesus Christ let it be on Jesus Christ
[1:22:32] let every man every messenger every
[1:22:34] helper every gift everything that was in
[1:22:37] there fall underneath that focus upon
[1:22:39] Jesus Christ that's what the prophet of
[1:22:42] our day pointed us to okay so when we're
[1:22:45] coming here we're looking at this we're
[1:22:48] privileged people in this changing world
[1:22:49] we have the whole of the hand of the
[1:22:51] unchangeable God time may change but
[1:22:54] he's eternal and his words in a heart
[1:22:56] right so God doesn't change he's eternal
[1:23:00] so the word is eternal and doesn't
[1:23:03] change and it's in a heart it's the
[1:23:05] ultimate of our thoughts what the word
[1:23:08] amen they always drift back to that word
[1:23:11] now this doesn't mean that your thoughts
[1:23:13] drifted somewhere else out there and
[1:23:15] become caught up in the garbage of the
[1:23:17] world it's saying that when we go
[1:23:18] through life our day to day life our day
[1:23:20] to day doings in our things that we
[1:23:22] might be working along you'll be there
[1:23:25] laboring away and then something will
[1:23:27] come to you you remember a scripture
[1:23:29] you'll remember something and something
[1:23:31] the Prophet said and and you know your
[1:23:34] heart is rejoicing there and you come
[1:23:36] back it comes yard it's the ultimate of
[1:23:38] our thoughts and they always drift back
[1:23:39] to the word a real believers thoughts
[1:23:43] will always ultimately bring him right
[1:23:44] back to the word no matter where we
[1:23:46] stray it comes back to the word it's a
[1:23:49] time post in our heart we're so grateful
[1:23:50] for that now what I'm saying right there
[1:23:52] might offend some and I'm sorry that it
[1:23:54] would offend them but my brother and
[1:23:56] sister the Word of God the prophet of
[1:23:58] God you add them together it's going to
[1:24:00] be over 400 times using various words
[1:24:03] the prophet of God tells us to take it
[1:24:05] back to the Word of God take it back to
[1:24:07] the scripture I think I'm just going to
[1:24:10] go ahead
[1:24:11] make a public declaration that that's my
[1:24:13] absolute 400 times Plus have to admit I
[1:24:19] was gonna ride him down as I was
[1:24:21] searching through it and I didn't but
[1:24:23] you're gonna find a lot of times the
[1:24:26] prophet of God telling us take it back
[1:24:28] to the word take it back to the
[1:24:29] scripture take it back to the Bible why
[1:24:32] are we doing that we're not doing that
[1:24:34] Saints because we doubt the messenger of
[1:24:37] the hour we're doing that because every
[1:24:40] time now I don't want to offend anybody
[1:24:44] I may well already done that today but
[1:24:46] we'll work on that and I say I'm sorry
[1:24:48] and sincerity but did you know it'll do
[1:24:52] us a great benefit when the prophet of
[1:24:55] god is talking about things in the
[1:24:56] message we focus on what he said push
[1:25:00] pause whether you got your phone in your
[1:25:03] hand whether you got your hands on your
[1:25:04] Bible go look the scripture up well
[1:25:12] sunday-school brother Jason's sister
[1:25:14] Emmy and the kids a youth group what are
[1:25:18] we doing we're constantly working upon
[1:25:20] the children to be able to find things
[1:25:23] in our Bible but we're adults and we're
[1:25:26] exempt from that no I don't think so
[1:25:28] take it back to the word take it back to
[1:25:31] the word it's good for us like adult
[1:25:34] Sunday school if you want or will amen
[1:25:38] now look see I've got a lot here and
[1:25:41] will not even come close to making it
[1:25:43] through it here this morning brother
[1:25:46] Brahm says here in the message victory
[1:25:47] day we got to get ourselves focus to
[1:25:51] whether we live or die sink or drown
[1:25:54] it's Calvary Christ that's the thing
[1:25:58] that God wants us to come back to amen
[1:26:01] so there is our place that we focus now
[1:26:04] my brother and sister we got to get
[1:26:06] ourselves focused that we know it's
[1:26:09] Calvary it's Christ and that's the only
[1:26:11] thing that we are looking to hallelujah
[1:26:14] God sent a prophet for our day to
[1:26:16] correct the misnomers and
[1:26:18] misrepresentations and the confusion my
[1:26:21] brother and sister and that very prophet
[1:26:23] that was here to restore
[1:26:24] the word back in our day was also there
[1:26:27] declaring to us take it back to the word
[1:26:30] amen he didn't put a time line he didn't
[1:26:33] put a date on it
[1:26:34] he didn't say take it back until this
[1:26:36] circumstance he said take it back to the
[1:26:40] word amen
[1:26:42] now look here as we look into Victory
[1:26:47] Day hmm brother Ivan do we have another
[1:26:51] quote on Victory Day there one that
[1:26:55] would start off and what did we do at
[1:26:57] v-day we sang songs we screamed we throw
[1:27:00] our hats in the air that's all right
[1:27:03] don't worry about it brother Ivan I'll
[1:27:05] just I'll just preach my way through it
[1:27:06] real quick
[1:27:07] it's a Victory Day 1963 April 21st
[1:27:13] paragraph 116 if you want to start he's
[1:27:15] talking about how on v-day we sang songs
[1:27:18] we screamed we throw our hats in the air
[1:27:20] we shot guns in the air we cried we
[1:27:22] blowed whistles we beat drums we played
[1:27:24] music we beat one another on the back
[1:27:27] what was it it was a victory oh we had
[1:27:30] the victory how why we felt we won we
[1:27:32] have won flags went up and the trumpets
[1:27:35] sounded and all what a time we had
[1:27:37] victory victory victory we won and it
[1:27:40] was a great thing it brought peace to
[1:27:41] the Christian nations as so called and
[1:27:44] we had a little time of breathing and
[1:27:46] some of the boys as a living come back
[1:27:48] home and so forth and many but many
[1:27:51] great them days has been many of them
[1:27:54] and great wars but you know all along
[1:27:58] there had been that kind of battle
[1:28:00] fought there was also been God's
[1:28:01] believing people that had many great
[1:28:04] victory V days - oh yes there's been on
[1:28:08] both sides where the glass has focused
[1:28:13] and went to the natural side with V days
[1:28:15] also where it focused into the word in
[1:28:18] the scripture it brings another v-day
[1:28:20] sometimes now once you look at this my
[1:28:22] brother and sister is talking you know
[1:28:24] v-day was there was a deed a brother
[1:28:26] Brown talks about that there was a v-day
[1:28:28] and then there was when the war was over
[1:28:30] there was a v-day it was a victory that
[1:28:32] was broad a victory that was there and
[1:28:34] how it was founded and you know we look
[1:28:36] at Israel and we see
[1:28:38] how that Israel my brother and sister
[1:28:40] when there was victory in the camp in
[1:28:43] Israel there was always a shout that
[1:28:46] accompanied they didn't have victory and
[1:28:48] sat there silent they had a victory they
[1:28:51] screamed to the Lord they yelled praises
[1:28:53] you know sang to Hosanna and my brother
[1:28:56] and sister they were excited about that
[1:28:58] because there was a victory Amen so you
[1:29:02] know we look at this and realize how you
[1:29:06] know he's talking about now in the
[1:29:07] carnal here we've had many great battles
[1:29:10] against our enemy and God has had great
[1:29:13] men that are standing at the front who
[1:29:18] has been able to capture by the Spirit
[1:29:20] of God the thoughts of the people and
[1:29:22] throw it into the kingdom of God yonder
[1:29:24] and come out victorious now you take
[1:29:27] that quote and brother Ivan will have
[1:29:29] that it looks like in just a minute for
[1:29:30] us but you take that quote right there
[1:29:32] my brother and sister you see what we've
[1:29:34] had is we've had this glass this focus
[1:29:37] on the natural side and in the natural
[1:29:40] side we have victories we have things
[1:29:42] that happen in our lives we get a raises
[1:29:46] at work we get new jobs we buy a house
[1:29:48] car train a plane and we view those
[1:29:50] things as victories but we'll look at
[1:29:53] this my brother and sister it also
[1:29:54] focuses on the word in the scripture
[1:29:57] which brings another VD and other
[1:29:58] victory and so the same nature right
[1:30:01] natural and spiritual together the same
[1:30:03] nature that would give us victories
[1:30:05] things that we would call
[1:30:06] accomplishments things we would share
[1:30:08] with our friends and family things that
[1:30:10] we would hold up is important there is a
[1:30:12] spiritual sign where were you and I can
[1:30:15] sit here today and say by God's grace
[1:30:17] there was a time that I was I felt
[1:30:19] defeated I felt like giving up and
[1:30:21] something happened maybe you know
[1:30:24] exactly what happened but you say you
[1:30:25] know what this happened and God brought
[1:30:28] a victory and I got deliverance maybe
[1:30:30] you come to the word you know we often
[1:30:32] talk about the little story a brother
[1:30:34] branham now the man the brother couldn't
[1:30:36] stop smoking brother branham Howsam send
[1:30:39] cigarettes to the man the man looks at
[1:30:41] that and something happened what was it
[1:30:44] it seems impractical to our mind but
[1:30:46] there was a victory that was brought
[1:30:48] right there there was a little woman a
[1:30:50] little mama
[1:30:51] that was there she was praying that God
[1:30:53] would send someone to save her son who
[1:30:56] had drifted away from the Lord and
[1:30:57] caught a disease and she's out there and
[1:31:00] she's leaning on the gate and she's
[1:31:02] praying believing that God's gonna give
[1:31:04] an answer to her prayer for her baby and
[1:31:07] God is there and he moves upon a prophet
[1:31:10] who's supposed to be catching a plane
[1:31:11] and he walks out and turns down the
[1:31:13] street and goes a different direction
[1:31:15] and follows a leadership to turn and to
[1:31:18] turn into walk and then he comes and
[1:31:20] there as he calls it and Aunt Jemima
[1:31:21] she's there leaning on the fence with
[1:31:25] the dew of the morning upon her she
[1:31:28] didn't see someone coming and run out to
[1:31:30] the fence she had been so focused on God
[1:31:34] touching her boy that she took the
[1:31:37] sacrifice and a prophet of God who was
[1:31:40] focused upon the leadership of God walks
[1:31:42] out of a little cafe turns right or left
[1:31:45] I don't remember which it is and goes
[1:31:47] down the street in a different direction
[1:31:48] and turns and turns and turns and comes
[1:31:51] there and that young man received his
[1:31:54] healing because he had a mama that was
[1:31:57] focused that God was a healer and God
[1:32:00] would hear her prayer and God said I've
[1:32:03] so respect her that he led the Prophet
[1:32:08] to her to them o my brother and sister
[1:32:13] we've got to get to a place it's not
[1:32:15] just casual we got to get to a place
[1:32:16] that as a church we're not just saying
[1:32:18] well we just hope that God will do
[1:32:20] something now look this is not gonna
[1:32:23] sound right so forgive me Saints but I
[1:32:26] hope that we were sincere enough on
[1:32:28] Friday 7:30 to get down and to pray I
[1:32:32] understand their circumstances in life
[1:32:35] I'm not I'm not here to belittle to
[1:32:37] belabor this but my brother and sister
[1:32:39] we got to get to a place that was
[1:32:41] sincere enough believing that joining
[1:32:43] together while we can't do it inside of
[1:32:45] a building that joining together in the
[1:32:48] spirit in the presence of God will make
[1:32:50] a difference but if we're not focused if
[1:32:53] it doesn't mean anything to us then pray
[1:32:56] all you like it won't change you got to
[1:32:59] be sincere it's got to be something
[1:33:01] you're focused upon oh my brother and
[1:33:04] sister
[1:33:04] but look at this now we've had it
[1:33:10] we've had many of those great battles
[1:33:12] against our enemy and God has had great
[1:33:15] men out there that standing at the front
[1:33:17] who has been able to capture by the
[1:33:20] Spirit of God the thoughts of the people
[1:33:22] and throw it into the kingdom of God
[1:33:25] yonder and come out victorious you say
[1:33:29] now brother Paul what is brother Branham
[1:33:31] talking about well let me just put it to
[1:33:33] you this way Saints we have many
[1:33:35] testimonies right here in this church
[1:33:37] many testimonies of ministry that's come
[1:33:39] through this church and men ministry
[1:33:42] that's here of the preacher preaching
[1:33:45] what you spoke of at the table they
[1:33:47] preached on what you spoke of in your
[1:33:49] car in your quiet and private places
[1:33:52] they preached on the scripture that you
[1:33:55] had been led to be reading they preached
[1:33:57] on the circumstances that you were
[1:33:59] enduring or going through at the very
[1:34:02] moment was that some great man no it's
[1:34:04] right here my brother and sister God's
[1:34:07] had great men out there standing front
[1:34:08] who's been able to capture by the Spirit
[1:34:12] of God and when you're in the spirit and
[1:34:15] you have sincere things and you have the
[1:34:18] sincere desires and sincere questions
[1:34:20] and you got ministry that is sincere to
[1:34:23] be able to stand before you and preach
[1:34:25] the Word of God and the Spirit of God
[1:34:27] takes what you're speaking and takes
[1:34:29] this minister and puts them together and
[1:34:31] takes it back into the word and delivers
[1:34:33] it out my brother and sister that's
[1:34:34] nothing less than the power of Almighty
[1:34:37] God right here in our mist and then
[1:34:39] people would say well we just don't
[1:34:40] really see God doing anything well good
[1:34:43] you sit right there and say gods are not
[1:34:44] doing anything I'm gonna testify my God
[1:34:47] hears me and my God hears you and my God
[1:34:50] will witness that this is his word and
[1:34:53] he is present to bring it to us
[1:34:55] hallelujah it's not a man this is not a
[1:34:59] man I've heard people say well you know
[1:35:01] this man answered questions
[1:35:03] this man III had questions about the
[1:35:06] message of the hour this man answered my
[1:35:08] question and they put that man up on a
[1:35:11] pedestal because he spoke to their need
[1:35:13] and they totally missed it that it was
[1:35:16] the Spirit of God that man
[1:35:18] was there by the Spirit of God grasping
[1:35:20] and it was there that God knew what they
[1:35:22] needed and anointed that man and he
[1:35:25] threw that right out into the kingdom of
[1:35:27] God yonder and he come out victorious
[1:35:29] but what happened did they go back and
[1:35:32] give praise to God
[1:35:33] no oftentimes they lifted the man up my
[1:35:37] brother and sister were focused on the
[1:35:39] wrong thing don't lift the man up say
[1:35:42] God bless you say I appreciate what you
[1:35:44] preach brother it was good I needed it
[1:35:47] but give the praise in the glory and the
[1:35:49] honor to God hallelujah
[1:35:51] oh my Oh hallelujah you see my brother
[1:35:57] and sister oh my
[1:36:06] we fighter we fight it every day every
[1:36:11] Christian fights a battle every day
[1:36:13] we're in a warfare right now going on
[1:36:16] constantly within us between right and
[1:36:18] wrong shall we receive it what shall we
[1:36:22] do shall we bow to the world shall we
[1:36:27] give up this thought that we got and if
[1:36:30] we see it focus it take it oh my kind of
[1:36:35] appears to me now I'll be reading
[1:36:37] between the lines here so I might be out
[1:36:39] on a limb but he says right here and if
[1:36:43] we see it focus it ok don't just use a
[1:36:47] shotgun effect the problem is we got we
[1:36:49] got way too many message people that you
[1:36:51] know they think well the shotgun works
[1:36:52] for defending my house now it ought to
[1:36:55] work for the message so we'll get one
[1:36:57] little pellet and a chunk over here and
[1:36:58] one little pedal and a chunk over here
[1:36:59] and shred something else and what no my
[1:37:02] brother and sister the reason hoe behind
[1:37:06] this I'm gonna sound like a psychologist
[1:37:08] the reason God made a prophet to where
[1:37:12] he labored so hard to sight his rifle in
[1:37:15] so close that it put the bullet through
[1:37:18] the same hole is because he had to have
[1:37:22] that same approach to the word
[1:37:28] not a shotgun effect it had to be
[1:37:32] precise it had to hit the mark it had to
[1:37:35] be right there drilled because Jesus
[1:37:37] Christ the same yesterday today and
[1:37:40] forever it had to hit the mark
[1:37:44] hallelujah
[1:37:45] ya see hope I'm not reading between the
[1:37:50] lines but it sure looks like he's saying
[1:37:52] take it back to the word here and if we
[1:37:54] see it focus it take it from Genesis to
[1:37:56] Revelation
[1:37:57] she has thus sayeth the Lord each time
[1:38:00] right down through there we can't give
[1:38:02] it up hmmm I just got to mind my manners
[1:38:06] here I'm feeling feisty this morning we
[1:38:11] can't compromise with the rest of them
[1:38:12] we just can't do it we've got to stay
[1:38:15] here that's all and no matter how many
[1:38:17] how great the enemy and how much
[1:38:19] machinery he's got against us and how
[1:38:21] many organizations and how many of this
[1:38:23] that and the other we yet we have pulled
[1:38:27] this focus of God's Word till we find
[1:38:31] that there's one thing and that's the
[1:38:35] blood of Jesus Christ and he's the same
[1:38:37] yesterday today and forever
[1:38:40] therefore don't make any difference what
[1:38:42] anyone else says they say the days of
[1:38:44] miracles past there's no such a thing as
[1:38:46] divine healing
[1:38:47] there's no baptism of the Holy Spirit
[1:38:49] and the baptism in the name of Jesus
[1:38:51] Christ that was for the disciples only
[1:38:53] and all these things they're trying to
[1:38:56] focus off of it oh my you see the
[1:39:07] versions of the message if it's not
[1:39:11] right on the Word of God they're trying
[1:39:13] to focus you right off of to something
[1:39:17] else in Chile I hope this wouldn't go
[1:39:24] there I wouldn't want to embarrass
[1:39:25] anyone but my brother and sister there's
[1:39:29] ministry that got caught up in the
[1:39:31] thunders years ago I preached it Church
[1:39:35] there I've preached it sister Jerry
[1:39:37] joked that I caught the spirit I was
[1:39:38] standing on the front row standing on
[1:39:40] there their deals
[1:39:42] they're preaching to him I don't know if
[1:39:44] people hand it here I can't do it here
[1:39:45] cuz sister su sitting there you might
[1:39:49] not see her right now but in reality
[1:39:50] sister Sue's right here amen
[1:39:53] but my brother and sister you see you
[1:39:57] would start to preach the word and they
[1:39:59] were so anointed they would jump up and
[1:40:02] scream and run up to the pulpit and wave
[1:40:04] their arms in your face screaming it's
[1:40:09] like what did I say what they didn't
[1:40:11] realize they did before the service over
[1:40:13] by God's grace but what they didn't
[1:40:14] realize is I was telling them what they
[1:40:17] believed was false and they jump up out
[1:40:21] of their seats and scream up to the
[1:40:22] front and wave their arms in my face we
[1:40:26] know what they told me they weren't
[1:40:28] listening their form of worship their
[1:40:32] form of coming before God had
[1:40:34] overwhelmed them they no longer listened
[1:40:37] to the Word of God it was an emotional
[1:40:40] experience but God was gracious enough I
[1:40:44] just quit preaching when they would run
[1:40:46] to the front
[1:40:47] I just stopped didn't take very long
[1:40:49] they realized I wasn't interested in all
[1:40:51] their enthusiasm Suzy Haslam's good
[1:40:53] Saints we need some right amen if we
[1:40:56] don't have any emotion we're dead
[1:40:58] some enthusiasm is good but that's not
[1:41:01] all the prophet of God says that hearing
[1:41:03] the Word of God is our priority
[1:41:05] amen it's not all the rest of this the
[1:41:08] music the songs all of this is all
[1:41:10] wonderful it's beautiful I'm glad of it
[1:41:12] but it's the preaching of the word and
[1:41:14] the hearing of the word that is the
[1:41:16] priority and God knows how to work that
[1:41:25] they like enthusiastic preaching they
[1:41:27] sure did but what it was as God was
[1:41:30] doing and you know what happened there
[1:41:31] that church had a revival and a change
[1:41:33] complete change of direction because
[1:41:36] their young people said we say we're
[1:41:40] special we say God is this but we're no
[1:41:46] different than anyone else
[1:41:49] and when the pastor's own son got up and
[1:41:53] walked out of church not not in that
[1:41:55] service but previous time said I'm done
[1:41:59] I'm done
[1:42:02] the pastor says something's wrong
[1:42:07] something's wrong
[1:42:09] but he got focused and he started going
[1:42:12] from Genesis to Revelation and he
[1:42:17] realized he had put his church in a
[1:42:21] little box on this side over here and it
[1:42:25] was no wonder it wasn't working because
[1:42:27] we weren't given just to take one little
[1:42:29] portion of the word we were given
[1:42:32] Genesis to Revelation we were given the
[1:42:35] promise I believe it would be a good
[1:42:38] place to quit right now I've got so much
[1:42:41] more I knew I did this morning as I was
[1:42:44] trying to actually just put what I had
[1:42:46] in order and I kept coming across these
[1:42:48] things but you see as we'll go I just
[1:42:51] want to finish this last thought right
[1:42:52] here and all these things they try to
[1:42:54] focus off of it what is it distraction
[1:42:56] my brother and sister people are fine
[1:42:59] they say you know it's interesting you
[1:43:02] you deal with you know like seventh-day
[1:43:04] Adventists and you deal with Jehovah
[1:43:06] Witnesses and I've got to the place I
[1:43:09] don't even debate with them I just
[1:43:11] simply ask them do you guys believe all
[1:43:13] of the Bible and they will tell you yes
[1:43:16] we believe all of the Bible all you have
[1:43:19] to do is bring up a couple points and
[1:43:21] they have to go you don't even have to
[1:43:24] argue with them you just have to speak
[1:43:26] the right things and they won't see they
[1:43:29] won't go back to the word they've been
[1:43:32] brought into a religion our message was
[1:43:36] called to focus us on Jesus Christ not
[1:43:41] how did how did brother Brown put that I
[1:43:43] won't get the words exactly right but he
[1:43:45] said something in the order I'm afraid
[1:43:47] we're getting people to church and not
[1:43:50] to Christ let's not do that Saints let's
[1:43:54] get to Christ that our focus be Jesus
[1:43:58] Christ
[1:43:58] not Church
[1:44:00] hallelujah sister Emmie would you come
[1:44:02] amen
[1:44:04] still it focuses right back to the word
[1:44:06] and nobody can say it's not there that's
[1:44:08] right so we're in a warfare and gods
[1:44:10] heroes have always had warfare now I
[1:44:15] want to close out with this right here
[1:44:16] cuz I still have several more quotes and
[1:44:18] some of them are actually quite lengthy
[1:44:20] I want to say this today I believe
[1:44:25] everyone who lives the word for this day
[1:44:28] lives the word of the hour is a hero to
[1:44:31] me
[1:44:33] amen it's that simple
[1:44:35] I look out some might not have talents
[1:44:38] to sing and play instruments and do
[1:44:41] different things I don't care you're
[1:44:42] living the word you're a hero to me Amen
[1:44:45] Alleluia I don't care about your money I
[1:44:48] don't care about your talents I don't
[1:44:49] care about your position Amen he says so
[1:44:52] we're in a warfare when God's Heroes has
[1:44:54] always had warfare hallelujah I want to
[1:44:57] be a hero
[1:44:58] hey man I want to be a hero not
[1:45:00] recognized by this world by some medal
[1:45:02] but to be recognized by my god you know
[1:45:05] my brother and sister you know there's
[1:45:08] just a lot of stuff happening around us
[1:45:10] a lot of a lot of questionable things
[1:45:13] and things we don't understand remember

[1:47:50] think it's really good but then I have
[1:47:53] been told that I'm easily impressed
[1:47:56] might be so but I tell you this message

[1:48:51] but we are the engrafted word coming to
[1:48:54] pass and it's producing the very life of
[1:48:57] Christ so we had to have his life in us
