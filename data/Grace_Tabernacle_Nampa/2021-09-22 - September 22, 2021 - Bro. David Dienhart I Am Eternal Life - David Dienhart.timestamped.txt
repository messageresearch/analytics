[38:30] though it may seem uphill sometimes
[38:32] god always gives word in the due season
[38:35] exactly what we need to hear when we
[38:36] need to hear it
[38:38] amen and that we never have to worry
[38:40] about what we're going to face or where
[38:41] we are currently
[38:43] because god's grace is always sufficient
[38:45] for us amen why don't we sing that song
[38:47] only believe
[38:50] amen
[38:55] [Music]
[39:05] all
[39:06] things are
[39:08] possible
[39:11] only
[39:16] [Music]
[39:41] lord i believe
[39:44] lord i
[39:45] believe
[39:46] [Music]
[39:50] lord i believe
[39:55] [Music]
[39:56] things are
[39:58] possible
[39:59] [Music]
[40:02] lord i
[40:04] believe
[40:05] [Music]
[40:10] i believe
[40:12] [Music]
[40:15] lord i believe
[40:19] [Music]
[40:20] all things
[40:26] [Music]
[40:32] hallelujah
[40:35] how many believers we have here today
[40:38] you know what makes a believer
[40:42] not feelings not emotions
[40:46] what makes a believer is that
[40:48] the word is revealed to
[40:51] faith
[40:53] amen
[40:54] amen a believer was in christ in god a
[40:57] believer before the foundation of the
[40:59] world
[41:00] that's what makes him a believer
[41:03] god knew you before the world began he
[41:06] foresaw you even sitting here tonight
[41:09] he saw you'd be here he knew you would
[41:11] be here and he knows your very heart
[41:14] amen
[41:16] so a believer will take god at his word
[41:19] a believer believes the word of god to
[41:21] be absolute
[41:23] the ultimate
[41:25] the amen turn this down
[41:27] the amen the ultimate amen
[41:30] so that's a believer he was always a
[41:33] believer
[41:34] you maybe didn't recognize it until the
[41:36] word of the lord came to you
[41:39] preached in its season when the light
[41:41] could come upon that heart
[41:43] that could believe amen you realize you
[41:46] weren't a chicken after all you're an
[41:48] eagle
[41:50] amen
[41:51] [Music]
[41:52] amen and then you could be born again
[41:54] that's a real believer
[41:56] not one that says he is
[41:59] but not one just
[42:01] that professes it but lives what he
[42:04] believes
[42:05] that's a believer amen amen god bless
[42:08] you
[42:09] i don't think we'll sing anymore but
[42:11] aren't you how am i looking for beulah
[42:13] land
[42:16] we're looking to cross over
[42:18] amen
[42:19] amen that god required god has
[42:21] requirements to do that
[42:23] god requires his own life in you
[42:27] not just the statement not church
[42:28] joining not church participation the
[42:31] world looks at that they don't care how
[42:32] you participate just so you miss the
[42:35] literal life of jesus christ
[42:38] amen satan don't care how religious you
[42:40] are
[42:43] but what he doesn't want to see is the
[42:44] manifestation of christ's life in you
[42:47] because because that's the difference
[42:50] amen that's what he's always fought
[42:52] against
[42:53] he'll try to do everything he can to
[42:55] keep you away from this word not man's
[42:58] interpretation we don't have a right to
[43:00] put our interpretation to the word of
[43:02] god there is no man that can interpret
[43:04] the word god does his own interpreting
[43:07] it's not of private interpretation
[43:10] amen it's not this person said this and
[43:13] this one said this well i have my own
[43:15] interpretation you have no right to your
[43:17] interpretation god interpreted his word
[43:19] through the ordained way of interpreting
[43:21] it and that was through a prophet by
[43:22] bringing it to pass
[43:24] amen he did it that way he always does
[43:27] it that way when god says something then
[43:29] he comes back and fulfills that
[43:32] who can say otherwise
[43:34] that's god's interpretation
[43:36] amen and that's why he had to send his
[43:38] prophets to whom the word of god comes
[43:41] to
[43:42] amen i didn't know how to bring this
[43:44] tonight i was
[43:45] i i come out here and and lo and behold
[43:48] there's more here than i thought there
[43:49] was
[43:50] so
[43:52] when i went in that room there was four
[43:53] or five
[43:56] so anyway i'm thankful to all these that
[43:58] made it god bless you
[44:00] and uh may god be with you and be with
[44:02] those traveling tomorrow and
[44:04] and to the men's meeting i mean i'd like
[44:06] you to stand with me
[44:08] and let's remember our brother paul
[44:10] in prayer i don't know if they got there
[44:12] well corrected or not but
[44:14] uh
[44:15] it was kind of a
[44:17] we'll keep that in prayer
[44:18] amen
[44:20] amen so that's always something comes up
[44:23] but god has a purpose in those things
[44:26] he doesn't allow anything to come upon
[44:27] us
[44:28] and and but what first of all we could
[44:30] bear it it makes a way out of it but
[44:32] also has a purpose in it
[44:34] amen amen i'd like you to turn me the
[44:37] book of ephesians
[44:40] the book of ephesians i
[44:46] just
[44:47] want to read these scriptures here i
[44:49] don't know exactly how to title this
[44:51] tonight i had it titled and i thought
[44:53] i'd change it now maybe i'll go back to
[44:55] my title again so
[44:57] just this just let's have a word of
[44:59] prayer our heavenly father
[45:03] we are so thankful that you're in
[45:04] control
[45:06] it's not man that controls it's you that
[45:08] controls lord
[45:09] lord we as uh we need a shepherd and
[45:12] that's why the lord is our shepherd
[45:14] and lord we can't lead ourself we're
[45:16] independent and but everyone no matter
[45:19] who they are is being led and there's
[45:20] only two powers in the earth today
[45:22] that's the power of satan the religious
[45:25] deception and that's the power of god
[45:28] through his promised word
[45:29] and so father there's two those two
[45:31] powers and one of those is leading each
[45:33] individual
[45:34] the lord you have selected and you have
[45:36] chosen a bride in this hour
[45:39] that lord was in you a part of you was a
[45:42] very thought of yourself
[45:44] to be presented here in this hour that
[45:47] would believe your word would not turn
[45:49] away from that word and that's not
[45:51] something she has
[45:52] that in her intellect but that's what's
[45:54] in her heart you placed it there and
[45:56] you've opened it up and lord because
[45:58] we're always were a part of you you said
[46:00] in your word that you are the word in
[46:02] the beginning was the word and the word
[46:04] was with god and the word was god
[46:07] and you even said that that lord in him
[46:10] was life
[46:12] and the life was the light so we know
[46:14] lord that to be your bride we have to be
[46:17] of your life
[46:19] to be a son of god we must be a part of
[46:21] your life
[46:23] and so father we know then that life
[46:25] when it's manifested individually in a
[46:27] member many member bride today it would
[46:30] be the light
[46:31] that's what makes us the light because
[46:33] we have your life
[46:35] and so father we thank you for this now
[46:37] i pray that you bless your word open it
[46:40] as you desire for thy glory and honor in
[46:42] jesus christ's name we pray
[46:44] amen
[46:46] amen
[46:49] i'd like to title this
[46:51] and i had it titled i am eternal life
[46:53] now if that chokes anybody i'm sorry but
[46:56] but the message of this hour and the
[46:58] scriptures proclaim
[47:00] that a true believer having the holy
[47:02] spirit in them dwelling in them
[47:05] they had to be a part of god before the
[47:07] foundation of the world
[47:09] and so
[47:10] that life there's only one eternal life
[47:12] and that's god himself
[47:15] in order for you to have eternal life or
[47:17] to know eternal life because eternal
[47:19] life is a person it's not a piece of
[47:20] real estate it is a person
[47:23] and eternal life is a person so lord we
[47:26] know
[47:28] that in order to have eternal life
[47:31] we had to be a part of you before the
[47:32] world began part of your thinking of
[47:35] your own self
[47:36] amen to be presented here in this hour
[47:39] in a body of clay
[47:41] to be lived out what he wanted to live
[47:44] out was himself in flesh
[47:46] amen so he has he has a body that god
[47:50] has prepared for him amen and we'll try
[47:53] to get into that more tonight so but
[47:56] we're speaking about
[47:59] the identifier there is something that
[48:02] has to identify that gives you strength
[48:04] it gives you courage that absolutely
[48:07] sets your soul on fire realizing
[48:10] that what is in you what's in your soul
[48:12] is the real you
[48:15] amen and therefore we don't have
[48:16] confidence in man but we have confidence
[48:19] in that open word
[48:21] amen and so we we we we have this
[48:24] identifier which is the seal
[48:27] which is the token
[48:30] the seal is assigned the token is the
[48:32] seal it's both a sign
[48:35] that the price that the price that the
[48:37] blood that his blood poured out as a
[48:39] price you've come through that blood and
[48:42] now have the life of that blood which is
[48:44] what god requires
[48:46] in this hour it's a requirement if you
[48:49] expect to make a rapture you have to
[48:51] have that token
[48:53] which is his own life in you
[48:56] you can't manufacture that you can't
[48:58] make that happen
[49:00] that's god has given you that and we'll
[49:03] read it here in ephesians chapter one
[49:05] let's start with verse three
[49:09] blessed be the god and father of our
[49:11] lord jesus christ
[49:12] who hath that's past tense
[49:15] blessed us with all spiritual blessings
[49:20] in heavenly places
[49:22] in
[49:23] christ
[49:25] in
[49:26] heavenly places
[49:28] in christ
[49:29] that's not a future thing being in
[49:31] heavenly places
[49:33] that's you now
[49:35] by the power of the holy spirit by his
[49:38] own working by his own achievement
[49:41] has raised you up when he raised you
[49:44] raised we'll get into that in a few
[49:45] minutes but when he raised you raised
[49:48] with him
[49:49] and are now not will be i'm talking
[49:52] about the believer i'm talking about the
[49:53] saints that paul is writing to here
[49:56] this word not only written to the
[49:58] ephesian those saints he said i i'm i'm
[50:01] i'm writing to the the saints and to the
[50:04] faithful in christ jesus
[50:07] it's one thing to say well i believe but
[50:09] do you believe in him if you're
[50:11] believing in him you had to be a part of
[50:13] him as we said earlier you have to be a
[50:16] part of him to begin with so he makes
[50:18] you a believer in him
[50:20] and faithful those that are faithful in
[50:23] christ jesus don't let that little word
[50:25] in just run over it because that word in
[50:28] is very important
[50:31] amen
[50:32] so
[50:34] so we see here going on reading
[50:36] according as he has chosen us in him
[50:38] let's read that again according as he
[50:40] hath
[50:41] chosen so he's made a choice
[50:44] he's chosen us and where was where did
[50:46] he choose us
[50:47] in
[50:48] him
[50:49] in eternal life
[50:54] if you have eternal life you always did
[50:56] have eternal life
[50:58] amen you didn't know it when you came
[51:00] here because you came through a sexual
[51:01] birth you came here born and sin shaped
[51:03] iniquity but down in your heart was a
[51:06] seed planted there before the foundation
[51:08] of the world
[51:10] by him
[51:12] and he even calls his own children the
[51:14] seed
[51:15] you go to matthew 13 it's the seed
[51:18] that a sore sowed amen he said he's in
[51:20] his children our seed and we know that
[51:22] the seed his own children even even the
[51:25] bible identifies that all the way
[51:27] through amen
[51:29] they that are a seed christ's own seed
[51:32] amen so so he he spoke a word he even
[51:36] created the earth by a seed
[51:38] amen he's still creating by his seed
[51:41] amen
[51:42] amen see it was the seed it was the word
[51:44] spoken
[51:46] that brought forth life and god placed
[51:48] that in you and he knew you would
[51:50] respond to that word spoken for your
[51:52] season so but getting back here
[51:54] according he has he has chosen us so we
[51:57] see that he has chosen us is there any
[52:00] us here this mor tonight is there anyone
[52:02] that can identify them and see that this
[52:05] scripture is written of them
[52:08] amen how do you know it's written of you
[52:10] because you have the identifier you have
[52:12] the token itself you have you have the
[52:15] seal
[52:16] of himself in you
[52:19] without that you're not going in a
[52:20] rapture without that you have nothing to
[52:23] change your body amen without that you
[52:25] can't enter into that place without that
[52:28] seal
[52:29] god requires the seal of his own life
[52:32] amen the token is required
[52:36] because without that he said when i see
[52:38] the blood i'll pass over you how is he
[52:40] going to see the blood he sees his own
[52:42] life
[52:43] we don't have the literal blood of
[52:45] christ but we have his life
[52:47] and the life was in that blood and that
[52:48] was perfect blood that wasn't a man's
[52:50] blood that wasn't joseph's blood that
[52:52] wasn't mary's blood that was god's own
[52:54] created blood
[52:57] and he was the fullness of the godhead
[52:59] bodily in a man so if he was the
[53:02] fullness of all of god in him then you
[53:04] were in him then
[53:08] and you had to be in him then
[53:12] amen it wasn't part of him there it was
[53:14] all of him there
[53:16] so you died with him
[53:18] and you rose with him when you rose you
[53:20] rose with him okay so he chose you in
[53:23] him in him that just that ought to just
[53:25] set your soul of fire then when you have
[53:28] that revelation in you that he lives in
[53:31] you showing that you were chosen in him
[53:35] there's no way the devil can find you
[53:39] and we're going to come into that a
[53:40] little more amen that's exactly right
[53:42] because when you're hit in christ he
[53:45] can't get there
[53:48] there we spoke about no plague coming
[53:50] nigh thy dwelling thy dwelling is christ
[53:52] thy dwelling is his your his he is your
[53:56] habitation
[53:57] satan can't get there he can try to do
[54:00] something with the flesh man but he
[54:01] can't touch that reality of who you are
[54:04] he can't touch that real new creation
[54:08] amen and so and so we we see here
[54:12] reading on
[54:13] he said you were chosen in him before
[54:16] not just when you gave your heart the
[54:18] lord but before the foundation of the
[54:20] world
[54:21] that we should be holy and without blame
[54:26] you mean there's a people in this earth
[54:28] today that are blameless you mean to
[54:30] tell me there are people in this earth
[54:31] that are sinless
[54:33] absolutely there's a people in this
[54:35] earth today that were in christ to begin
[54:37] with that we're incredible christ now
[54:39] and how can you be nothing but perfect
[54:41] in christ
[54:43] because christ is not imperfect
[54:46] christ does not have does not have sin
[54:48] christ knows no sin and if you're in
[54:50] christ you're sinless
[54:53] i don't hear any amen's hardly out of
[54:55] that but that's the truth
[54:58] that's the scripture
[55:00] if you believe the scripture and believe
[55:01] it the invaluable word of god and that
[55:03] he god will will stand by his word he's
[55:06] obligated to his word he's not obligated
[55:09] to david's word but he is obligated to
[55:11] his own word and if he won't keep his
[55:13] word he's not worth serving
[55:16] but god will keep his word his words
[55:18] eternal he don't take it and turn around
[55:20] and say well i made a mistake i'll make
[55:21] it another way
[55:23] god never changes he said i change not i
[55:26] am god and i change not jesus christ
[55:28] which is that god made flesh said i
[55:31] remain the same yesterday and today and
[55:34] forever he can't change what he did
[55:37] yesterday he'll do today man changes
[55:40] time changes thing changes but there's
[55:42] one thing that can't change that you can
[55:44] anchor your soul on and that's the word
[55:46] of god all right i don't mean keep you
[55:49] standing but you stand just a little
[55:50] more amen so you are you are chosen in
[55:54] him
[55:56] that we should before the foundational
[55:58] world that you should be holy and
[56:00] without blame before him in love
[56:04] in love god is love
[56:07] if you're in christ you're in love
[56:10] you can't love your brother properly you
[56:12] can't have a godly love you're in god
[56:15] unless you're in christ
[56:18] that's how we know we have love for the
[56:19] brother and because we have him in us we
[56:22] are in him he's in us by the spirit he's
[56:25] given us we know we love the brethren
[56:28] hallelujah is that right
[56:30] that's exactly right
[56:33] amen
[56:35] that's a much higher love than a human
[56:37] love
[56:39] amen that's not human love i'm talking
[56:41] about that's a love that loves the truth
[56:45] i mean that's god himself
[56:47] having predestinated us oh that's not a
[56:49] that's a bad word in the day but it
[56:51] isn't around here predestination he
[56:54] predestinates by his foreknowledge he
[56:56] knew you he knew you were part of him he
[56:58] already chose you and himself because
[57:00] you always were a part of him you didn't
[57:03] become a part of him you always were a
[57:05] part of him
[57:06] and in this hour because you're a part
[57:08] of him then you're here to manifest the
[57:10] word for this season that he brought in
[57:12] this season
[57:15] amen all right so
[57:17] having predestinated us unto the
[57:20] adoption that's placing of children by
[57:23] jesus christ to himself
[57:26] according to the good pleasure of what
[57:28] your will no his
[57:31] to the pleasure good pleasure of his
[57:33] will
[57:33] you don't have one thing to do in it
[57:38] amen you might as well just settle right
[57:40] there satan wants to beat you up and
[57:42] bring an anoints to you every day you
[57:44] live trying to point you to the wrong
[57:46] person
[57:48] you haven't been you haven't chose him
[57:50] he chose you and because he chose you
[57:52] you would chose him you would choose him
[57:55] but the bible said he chose us
[57:58] and then he give us a choice
[58:01] but because he placed that in us to
[58:03] believe his word are you going to get
[58:05] away from this word how are you going to
[58:07] leave it when you're a part of the word
[58:10] all right so so he said to the praise of
[58:13] the glory of his grace wherein he hath
[58:16] made us accepted in the beloved
[58:22] wherein he has made us accepted he it's
[58:25] his achievement he hath made us accepted
[58:29] in the beloved who's the beloved jesus
[58:33] christ himself made flesh
[58:37] god himself manifested in the flesh
[58:40] his son god was son god became son
[58:44] there's only one god there's not three
[58:46] gods there's no trinity of three persons
[58:50] there's only one person with three
[58:52] offices three attributes of that one
[58:54] person
[58:56] amen you're a triune being you have a
[58:58] soul you have a spirit you have a body
[59:05] hallelujah
[59:06] all right but you're one person
[59:10] all right
[59:12] now
[59:13] jumping down to verse 11 in whom this
[59:15] one that we're that we that have made us
[59:18] accepted in the beloved in that beloved
[59:20] in whom we have obtained an inheritance
[59:24] being predestinated according to the
[59:27] purpose of him
[59:29] according to the purpose of him who
[59:31] worketh all things after the counsel of
[59:34] your will no
[59:36] no
[59:37] after the counsel of his own will
[59:40] amen
[59:41] amen then verse
[59:43] 12 that we should be to the praise of
[59:46] his glory who first trusted in christ
[59:48] in whom also in whom ye also trusted
[59:53] after that
[59:54] you heard the word of truth the gospel
[59:56] of your salvation in whom in whom also
[1:00:01] after that you believed after you heard
[1:00:04] the word have you received now he goes
[1:00:06] on to say after that you believed you
[1:00:09] were sealed with that holy spirit a
[1:00:12] promise you were sealed so you may be
[1:00:15] seated thank you for standing
[1:00:19] you were sealed with that holy spirit of
[1:00:20] promise
[1:00:22] the seal
[1:00:24] identifies the seal are
[1:00:26] recognizes you have passed through the
[1:00:30] blood
[1:00:31] you
[1:00:32] are his property
[1:00:34] and there's nobody gonna take you out of
[1:00:37] his hands
[1:00:38] you're his property
[1:00:40] you're his eternal possession
[1:00:43] you are his kingdom because the kingdom
[1:00:45] of god is the word living in you so you
[1:00:48] become that word you are that word
[1:00:50] living
[1:00:52] in action
[1:00:53] amen
[1:00:54] you are the living word in action you
[1:00:56] know the word of god is sharper towards
[1:00:58] his sword living in and it's living and
[1:01:00] it's operative
[1:01:02] the word isn't just a letter we are not
[1:01:04] ministers we are not ministers of the
[1:01:07] letter we are ministers of the spirit
[1:01:10] of that word
[1:01:13] but without the spirit on the word
[1:01:17] no good
[1:01:18] you can have all the mechanics you want
[1:01:20] you can have all the letter you want you
[1:01:22] can have all you can simonize job the
[1:01:24] car you can you can wax it up you can
[1:01:26] dress just like a christian you can act
[1:01:27] but without the life there's no living
[1:01:29] there there's nothing to energize those
[1:01:32] mechanics to go down that road to go
[1:01:34] down that journey that we're on because
[1:01:36] everything that he that for this journey
[1:01:39] for his children has been provided for
[1:01:41] them through the baptism of the holy
[1:01:43] ghost everything they need in this
[1:01:45] journey they already have in them
[1:01:49] amen
[1:01:51] god already
[1:01:52] planned it that way he already gave it
[1:01:54] to you amen and everything you need he
[1:01:56] will provide it for he's our provider
[1:01:59] he's my shepherd i shall not want
[1:02:02] there's nothing i'm going to need but
[1:02:04] what he'll provide
[1:02:05] there's nothing can take you out of that
[1:02:08] seal once god seals you into himself
[1:02:10] there is nothing can remove that seal
[1:02:14] there's nothing can breach that seal
[1:02:16] until it comes to its destination and
[1:02:19] when it gets to assassination amen
[1:02:22] it's over with
[1:02:24] after you come into your body change

[1:03:08] purpose of god is according to election
[1:03:11] an election might that that it might
[1:03:14] stand you can't read it any other way
[1:03:17] the heart purpose what i want to get to
[1:03:18] the heart purpose
[1:03:21] the eternal purpose of god was to take a
[1:03:23] bride of his own choosing
[1:03:26] now god this doesn't choose with a whim
[1:03:29] i'll take him i'll leave him i'll take
[1:03:30] him no he knows and what he knows he
[1:03:33] acts on what he knows
[1:03:37] amen and god expects us to do the same
[1:03:40] act on what we know it's not what we
[1:03:42] imagine it's not what i hope is right we
[1:03:45] act upon faith
[1:03:48] amen
[1:03:49] god expects you let me just drop this in
[1:03:52] in this hour you say i go through a lot
[1:03:53] of this a lot of that and troubles and
[1:03:55] trials god is expecting you to persevere
[1:04:00] god is expecting you to prevail with his
[1:04:03] word
[1:04:06] just like jacob he wrestled it out he
[1:04:08] said let me go let me go skinny they
[1:04:10] said i will not let you go until you
[1:04:12] bless me that angel is that right he
[1:04:15] wrestled god expects you and i to
[1:04:16] wrestle it out amongst every situation
[1:04:19] amongst every trial amongst no matter
[1:04:21] what he is allowed to come your way to
[1:04:23] wrestle a doubt because he wants
[1:04:25] prevailers
[1:04:26] he's wanting to see you he's not may not
[1:04:28] give it to you right away what you ask
[1:04:30] but he heard your request and he expects
[1:04:32] you to prevail with that word and say
[1:04:34] it's done because he said so
[1:04:40] amen
[1:04:42] wants to see that prevailing
[1:04:44] amen not just become discouraged say
[1:04:46] well bless god i listen so you're
[1:04:48] listening to the devil say well you must
[1:04:49] not be a christian because you wouldn't
[1:04:51] be going through these kind of things or
[1:04:52] well you because you made this mistake
[1:04:54] in that mistake listen there is no
[1:04:56] mistake in christ
[1:04:58] god is not looking the bible said that
[1:05:00] god went look he told samuel he says i'm
[1:05:03] not looking as man looks they want to
[1:05:05] look on the outside is he a christian he
[1:05:06] looks on the outside to see if he's a
[1:05:08] christian or not no i'm not and but see
[1:05:11] look at god looks on the heart so
[1:05:13] tonight you're asked the question
[1:05:14] where's your heart
[1:05:17] because if you speak something it lives
[1:05:19] something different than what the holy
[1:05:21] ghost said in his word your heart's not
[1:05:22] in the word
[1:05:26] amen that's right
[1:05:29] we're not we're
[1:05:30] listen we believe in holy living we
[1:05:33] believe in holy dress we don't believe
[1:05:35] in women bobbing their hair
[1:05:37] and yet we don't believe in in women
[1:05:39] wearing these tight dresses and showing
[1:05:41] every form of their body we don't
[1:05:42] believe in that we believe god is a holy
[1:05:44] god
[1:05:45] but unless that heart's there you're
[1:05:47] doing it in vain
[1:05:51] amen but if the heart's there you're
[1:05:52] going to do it because you love the lord
[1:05:54] and you're going to be holy because he
[1:05:56] is
[1:05:57] how many know what i'm talking about
[1:06:00] amen so he looks on the heart remember
[1:06:02] god sees your heart
[1:06:05] you can say one thing outwardly here but
[1:06:07] where's the heart and if you really
[1:06:09] believe the word you're going to believe
[1:06:10] if you believe the god you're going to
[1:06:12] believe the word don't say you're a
[1:06:13] christian and then go out and do things
[1:06:15] contrary to the word that holy ghost
[1:06:18] can't live in you that way
[1:06:22] amen he's not there are you with me
[1:06:26] all right
[1:06:27] so he said his heart purpose was to take
[1:06:29] a bride of his own choosing and that
[1:06:31] purpose was in himself and being eternal
[1:06:34] was decreed before the foundation of the
[1:06:35] world
[1:06:37] i've just read it to you it was decreed
[1:06:39] already
[1:06:41] you had to be here because you ordained
[1:06:43] to be here not here in this building but
[1:06:45] in christ today you have to receive the
[1:06:48] message that was brought to you in this
[1:06:50] day to settle your heart to bring you to
[1:06:52] a rapturing body change
[1:06:57] he had to bring you to a rapture inside
[1:06:59] first
[1:07:01] before you're going to have an outside
[1:07:02] body change it's got to come within
[1:07:06] amen it's got to be a rapture within
[1:07:09] amen all right so not to get you taken
[1:07:12] off on these side notes but
[1:07:15] the thoughts of god
[1:07:17] the thoughts of god are eternal the
[1:07:19] thoughts of god i'm talking about the
[1:07:21] thoughts of himself there's only one
[1:07:23] form of eternal life and that's god you
[1:07:25] were chosen in him before the foundation
[1:07:27] of the world that's right
[1:07:29] that's right but those that he chose he
[1:07:31] called
[1:07:32] amen
[1:07:34] called those he called he justified and
[1:07:37] those that he justified he hath already
[1:07:39] glorified it's already a finished work
[1:07:42] amen are you with me then your future
[1:07:45] and we're getting into this right here
[1:07:47] in the next scripture i want to read but
[1:07:48] your future then is clear
[1:07:52] when you're in christ you have nothing
[1:07:55] to worry about you can sit back and let
[1:07:57] off the pressure no matter how much the
[1:07:59] devil wants to annoy you with this and
[1:08:01] with that it was something else
[1:08:04] he's going to punch at you you know
[1:08:06] every day you're going to have a punch
[1:08:08] at he's going to have a punch coming but
[1:08:10] you don't have to receive it
[1:08:14] you have to bow down to him no matter
[1:08:16] how much he punches
[1:08:19] because he can only with his punches go
[1:08:21] so far
[1:08:23] but you've got to recognize where as far
[1:08:25] as he goes he's only punching on the
[1:08:27] outward side he's only punching at the
[1:08:29] flesh the spirit man he can't enter that
[1:08:32] soul because if he could to get where
[1:08:33] you are you'd have to come through the
[1:08:35] blood and if he come to the blood he'd
[1:08:36] be my brother
[1:08:40] in christ he'd be in christ and he can't
[1:08:41] be in christ
[1:08:45] hallelujah
[1:08:46] you can't come you can only the only way
[1:08:48] you can be in him you have to come
[1:08:50] through the blood you must be born again
[1:08:52] and more and the new birth is more than
[1:08:54] saying i accept jesus as my savior
[1:08:57] that's good that's repentance it's a
[1:08:59] it's a heart it's a terrible thing that
[1:09:01] in the message itself that people
[1:09:02] haven't even truly repented
[1:09:07] that's the truth because repentance will
[1:09:09] if there's a true repentance of faith it
[1:09:12] leads to the baptism of of a public
[1:09:14] announcement of that faith that you
[1:09:16] believe in him and if you've done that
[1:09:18] through your faith properly in a real
[1:09:20] repentance then he has to sanctify you
[1:09:22] and fill you
[1:09:26] and the problem is is there not too many
[1:09:28] have a real repentance
[1:09:34] that's the truth
[1:09:35] it's a sad it's a sad fact but even
[1:09:38] around the message there's not many that
[1:09:39] have truly repented
[1:09:41] they want to join church say it sounds
[1:09:43] good to them they can follow a message
[1:09:44] have message books this message isn't
[1:09:47] tapes this message is a literal life of
[1:09:49] jesus christ the word living in you
[1:09:53] you have all the tapes you want you i'm
[1:09:55] not against that i believe in heaven
[1:09:56] tapes i believe in having cds i believe
[1:09:58] in hearing the message and we should be
[1:10:00] we should be focused on the word you
[1:10:02] should have a hunger for more of him
[1:10:07] but you can have a bible and still go to
[1:10:09] hell
[1:10:12] you can belong to a mess come to a messy
[1:10:14] church and participate in everything and
[1:10:16] still go to hell you can be baptized
[1:10:18] with the holy ghost
[1:10:19] in your spirit and not have that word
[1:10:21] down in your soul a real hunger for more
[1:10:23] of god and still miss it
[1:10:30] i'm speaking to believers tonight
[1:10:33] i'm speaking to real believers
[1:10:36] this seed when it's manifested brings
[1:10:39] life and joy and peace and
[1:10:41] and and rejoicing and satisfaction and
[1:10:45] comfort
[1:10:47] because it's christ in you the message
[1:10:49] is christ in you the message is christ
[1:10:52] the opening of the seven seals is christ
[1:10:55] the whole thing is christ in you
[1:10:58] maturing growing
[1:11:02] growing
[1:11:03] going
[1:11:05] gone
[1:11:06] that's what's happening today
[1:11:08] she's growing in the presence of this
[1:11:10] sun
[1:11:12] amen growing going
[1:11:15] where are we going we're marching out of
[1:11:17] here
[1:11:18] and step with the word and step with the
[1:11:20] revealed word you're marching out of
[1:11:22] here
[1:11:23] and pretty soon you're to become up
[1:11:25] missing you're gone
[1:11:29] and that is right on us
[1:11:36] amen all right
[1:11:39] so these elect
[1:11:41] are the eternal thoughts of god which
[1:11:44] were to be expressed in flesh in their
[1:11:47] seasons
[1:11:49] that's
[1:11:50] what this is
[1:11:52] his eternal thoughts being expressed
[1:11:55] that's what he come to redeem was his
[1:11:57] thoughts
[1:11:58] you were his thoughts you were the
[1:12:00] thought of himself
[1:12:02] and he ordained you to be because he
[1:12:04] knows for the end from the beginning
[1:12:06] and could ordain and predestinate and
[1:12:08] place you where you need to be in this
[1:12:10] hour
[1:12:12] amen amen amen
[1:12:15] i'm talking about this comforter has
[1:12:17] come
[1:12:18] i'm coughing about him being here
[1:12:20] amen so the message is himself
[1:12:23] unveiled
[1:12:26] incompleteness and the seal denotes a
[1:12:29] finished work
[1:12:33] okay
[1:12:34] so now let's go to let's take over to
[1:12:36] jeremiah a minute
[1:12:38] go to jeremiah i know how far i'm going
[1:12:40] to go with this tonight i'm trying to
[1:12:41] watch my time and it's slipping by
[1:12:43] quickly
[1:12:44] i'm on the second
[1:12:47] scripture
[1:12:48] all right jeremiah
[1:12:53] 29
[1:12:54] very familiar scripture
[1:12:57] but i want you to notice i just said
[1:12:58] these these elect seed this elect bride
[1:13:01] is his very is his eternal thoughts
[1:13:04] manifested in flesh in their season and
[1:13:07] the thoughts of god are eternal how many
[1:13:09] believe that
[1:13:10] amen
[1:13:12] amen all right so you coming from god to
[1:13:15] be manifested to be that god manifested
[1:13:18] in flesh today makes you eternal
[1:13:22] not this outer man i'm not talking about
[1:13:23] this eternal this is dying but i'm
[1:13:25] talking about that word that's been
[1:13:27] quickened in my soul
[1:13:29] that will take over and change this
[1:13:31] mortal body this mortal body will be
[1:13:33] what that is
[1:13:36] and it's growing and it's growing and
[1:13:37] it's growing and it's going to be
[1:13:39] changed
[1:13:41] amen all right
[1:13:43] but we know there's a bride on the scene
[1:13:45] today that's maturing in that sunlight
[1:13:49] amen all right
[1:13:51] and bringing the same message
[1:13:54] his message and our message
[1:13:56] jesus christ message and our message is
[1:13:59] the same message
[1:14:01] it's the same person
[1:14:04] veiled under different flesh veils but
[1:14:06] the same person
[1:14:08] if you can catch that revelation if you
[1:14:10] can get the revelation
[1:14:12] that the elect are the are the the elect
[1:14:15] are the thoughts eternal thoughts of god
[1:14:17] you're going to go
[1:14:19] quite a ways with that
[1:14:21] amen makes a difference
[1:14:24] all right now jeremiah 29
[1:14:28] watch these thoughts now watch what
[1:14:31] watch what he says here
[1:14:33] i know the thoughts
[1:14:36] eleven i know the thoughts
[1:14:40] that i think toward you
[1:14:44] saith the lord
[1:14:46] thoughts of peace and not of evil
[1:14:49] so who's putting those thoughts outside
[1:14:51] of peace who's putting those thoughts of
[1:14:53] evil in your heart trying to accuse you
[1:14:55] of being something you're not
[1:15:00] because god's thoughts toward you hasn't
[1:15:01] changed
[1:15:02] god's thoughts you that carry this holy
[1:15:04] spirit in you you're identified in him
[1:15:07] and don't you let the devil lie to you
[1:15:09] that you're not
[1:15:11] god is not going to judge you by your
[1:15:13] mistakes and your failures when he's
[1:15:16] already sealed you in christ
[1:15:19] amen
[1:15:24] but old the devil will judge you
[1:15:28] is that right oh he's going to accuse
[1:15:30] you
[1:15:31] but see he has no record to accuse you
[1:15:33] by
[1:15:35] because the record
[1:15:36] is the is the eternal life record which
[1:15:38] you're a part of which has already been
[1:15:40] identified to you by the seal
[1:15:43] you're in the record you're part of the
[1:15:44] record you are his own life manifested
[1:15:48] and the devil hates that when you go to
[1:15:50] dwelling on that and living that and
[1:15:52] walking that and talking that he hates
[1:15:54] it
[1:15:55] so he's going to try to annoy you any
[1:15:57] way he can
[1:15:59] to get your mind off of that to get you
[1:16:01] get you aside get you on the other side
[1:16:04] here
[1:16:05] off of the focus of the things that are
[1:16:07] eternal
[1:16:09] while we look not at the things which
[1:16:10] are temporal but the things which are
[1:16:12] eternal
[1:16:15] for the things which are eternal
[1:16:17] is god's word amen things which are
[1:16:19] temples
[1:16:20] temporary
[1:16:22] but the things which are not seen are
[1:16:24] eternal
[1:16:26] amen so which is the real
[1:16:28] the temporary or the eternal
[1:16:32] which is the real what you see that's
[1:16:34] falling away this to being dissolved
[1:16:36] right before your eyes the corruption
[1:16:38] and all the chaos and all the fusion of
[1:16:40] politics
[1:16:42] that's not god's doing
[1:16:44] god has no confusion god is not the
[1:16:46] author of confusion
[1:16:50] amen it's a babylon why because this
[1:16:52] nation has turned down the word they
[1:16:54] rejected it and all they can go to is a
[1:16:57] chaos and destruction that's the promise
[1:17:02] but there's a bride there is a people in
[1:17:04] the land and god said i know my thoughts
[1:17:06] toward you
[1:17:07] i've just expressed what his thoughts
[1:17:09] were toward you thoughts of peace and
[1:17:11] out of evil thoughts of the thoughts of
[1:17:13] a body change thoughts of bringing you
[1:17:14] to an expected end to bring you to an
[1:17:17] expected not an unexpected but an
[1:17:19] expected end
[1:17:23] and giving you the assurance of himself
[1:17:26] in you that he'll take you there you
[1:17:28] can't miss it because you're sealed to
[1:17:30] the day of your body change
[1:17:35] you are sealed and the book was sealed
[1:17:38] and when the book was opened it denoted
[1:17:40] a finished work it denotes the finished
[1:17:42] revelation of jesus christ which is the
[1:17:45] mystery
[1:17:47] that you are
[1:17:49] unveiled
[1:17:52] amen
[1:17:54] amen that's right
[1:18:00] and so he said so we have gives you an
[1:18:03] expected end
[1:18:05] you call upon me i and you shall go and
[1:18:08] pray unto me and i will hearken unto you
[1:18:11] how can he not hearken to his own voice
[1:18:15] your prayer in his name is not you
[1:18:17] praying it's him praying how can he not
[1:18:19] hearken to his own voice you are the
[1:18:21] voice
[1:18:23] just like when jesus showed up the
[1:18:25] message of the hour the message of the
[1:18:27] hour stood right before martha said lord
[1:18:29] if you'd have been here my brother would
[1:18:31] not have died
[1:18:33] yet nevertheless what you say
[1:18:35] god will answer god will do whatever you
[1:18:37] say you'll do and there stood the word
[1:18:40] there stood the message there stood the
[1:18:42] word promised for the season standing
[1:18:45] right in their midst in flesh
[1:18:49] is that right and they and then she said
[1:18:52] lord he said why jesus said your brother
[1:18:54] shall rise again
[1:18:57] watch watch him watch your answer yes i
[1:18:59] know lord someday
[1:19:02] someday he'll rise again that was all
[1:19:05] right someday he will but someday but
[1:19:07] jesus said but i am the resurrection
[1:19:10] i am the message of the hour
[1:19:12] what do you think the message of the
[1:19:14] hour is here if it's not jesus christ
[1:19:15] the same yesterday today and forever i
[1:19:18] am the resurrection
[1:19:23] i wonder if you believe in the message
[1:19:26] where's the message today
[1:19:28] i am the resurrection and the life
[1:19:32] he that liveth and believeth in me shall
[1:19:33] never die i am the resurrection as soon
[1:19:36] as she heard that
[1:19:37] what'd she do
[1:19:39] she received the she received the
[1:19:41] message
[1:19:42] and she went immediately to her sister
[1:19:44] and said to me to mary it was martha
[1:19:47] speaking but mary turned to mary and
[1:19:49] said the master is come
[1:19:51] there's the mystery of the seventh seal
[1:19:54] is this coming that's why we're glorying
[1:19:56] in what we have today is because we see
[1:19:59] him here
[1:20:02] amen
[1:20:03] there's the mystery of it right there
[1:20:06] all right
[1:20:07] and what's it denoting to you
[1:20:09] catching the mystery the unveiling of
[1:20:11] himself and you what's it saying to you

[1:21:54] confidence in that open revealed word in
[1:21:56] me
[1:21:59] that's my assurance that's my that's my
[1:22:02] that's that's my
[1:22:04] positive all right he said would only

[1:22:13] it'll take the body change it'll take
[1:22:14] the rapture is that right
[1:22:17] all right he said oh if she only took a
[1:22:19] positive position
[1:22:21] she has a positive position she's been
[1:22:23] positionally placed
[1:22:25] in perfection
[1:22:27] she's been positionally placed in
[1:22:29] eternity she's been placed positionally
[1:22:32] in christ she's been placed positionally
[1:22:34] as a not a failure but blameless
[1:22:37] faultless sinless and not a failure
[1:22:40] she's been absolutely positionally
[1:22:42] placed
[1:22:45] hallelujah
[1:22:47] all right now
[1:22:49] so we see here now he for all of the
[1:22:53] promises of god verse 20 in him there
[1:22:56] again in him are ye and in him amen
[1:23:02] there's no nose in that there's all it's
[1:23:04] all yea and in him amen unto the glory
[1:23:07] of god watch by us
[1:23:10] by us
[1:23:11] god working in and through his bride by
[1:23:13] us who's he where do you see him today
[1:23:16] he's in bride form
[1:23:19] amen he had to come and bribe for him to
[1:23:21] finish the mystery of himself he had to
[1:23:23] be here in bright form the revelation of
[1:23:25] that seal is that he's here in bride
[1:23:27] form he's here in your body in behind
[1:23:29] your skin
[1:23:32] oh the carnal world hates that but they
[1:23:34] hated it yesterday when he said the same
[1:23:36] thing to those pharisees also you judged
[1:23:38] by the flesh judge no man they say
[1:23:40] you're a man make yourself god he said
[1:23:43] did not i say in the word that your gods
[1:23:50] amen
[1:23:52] who were who was adam and eve anyway
[1:23:54] before that fall who were they they were
[1:23:56] a minor god
[1:23:58] they came right adam came right directly
[1:24:00] from god
[1:24:01] eve came directly out of adam
[1:24:04] amen are you with me
[1:24:07] okay so if we come directly from our our
[1:24:10] son of the second adam we and because
[1:24:12] the the elements that came out of his
[1:24:14] body when when adam went to sleep god
[1:24:16] took those elements and made he a woman
[1:24:19] is that right
[1:24:21] took out of the original creation and
[1:24:23] took a body
[1:24:24] and made a woman is that right and adam
[1:24:27] said this is now bone of my bone flesh
[1:24:28] in my flesh she's a woman she's a she's
[1:24:31] a man with a womb she's meant to bear
[1:24:33] life
[1:24:38] amen
[1:24:39] she come out of me so she was that was
[1:24:41] mr adam speaking to mrs adam
[1:24:46] amen that's exactly right and so what
[1:24:49] happened to and because of the love of
[1:24:50] his wife she persuaded him to partake of
[1:24:53] that fruit which brought forth a cane
[1:24:57] and then when he partook of the fruit it
[1:24:59] brought forth an able but somewhere
[1:25:00] along the line there was a devil there
[1:25:03] was a murderer come out of a murder
[1:25:05] called a serpent
[1:25:08] amen and she bore a cane
[1:25:11] adam only knew her one time where did
[1:25:12] cain come from
[1:25:14] cain was not cain was a murderer from
[1:25:16] the beginning but adam was in a murder
[1:25:19] so where'd that seed come from
[1:25:22] it wasn't eating an apple if that's the
[1:25:24] case you better pass the apples around
[1:25:25] let the people let the women see today
[1:25:27] they're naked
[1:25:29] and the women men wearing women's
[1:25:30] clothes and the men were
[1:25:32] and the women were men's clothes
[1:25:34] which is an abomination to god to put on
[1:25:36] anything that even pertain it to a man
[1:25:39] pertaineth to a woman
[1:25:43] you don't believe that huh
[1:25:45] go to deuteronomy 23 oh that's old
[1:25:47] testament well i'll have you know jesus
[1:25:49] magnified that old testament
[1:25:51] said you said in the scripture jesus
[1:25:53] said you said the scriptures that you
[1:25:55] shall not commit adultery but he said i
[1:25:57] say unto you he that looketh upon a
[1:25:58] woman to lust after has committed
[1:26:00] adultery already withered his heart then
[1:26:02] why did you present yourself in a way to
[1:26:04] make him lust for you
[1:26:07] stripping yourself naked it's not the
[1:26:08] spirit of god it's the spirit of the
[1:26:10] devil it's the spirit of the age because
[1:26:12] in genesis 6 it said jesus god said it
[1:26:15] would be jesus said it would be that way
[1:26:17] again
[1:26:18] as it was in the days of noah
[1:26:21] were the sons of god seth's children saw
[1:26:23] the daughters of man not daughters of
[1:26:26] god daughters of man they undressed
[1:26:28] themselves and they took who they wanted
[1:26:30] to take and
[1:26:31] had children by them and tell me if this
[1:26:34] is a wholesale adultery going on today
[1:26:36] it's a sign it's a flashing red light
[1:26:39] sign of the end that we're ready to be
[1:26:41] taken out of here
[1:26:44] and we are taken out of here in him i'm
[1:26:46] trying to get you the cross to see this
[1:26:48] when you're sealed by the holy ghost a
[1:26:50] promise it's finished for you your
[1:26:53] future's clear
[1:26:56] not saying you won't go through trials
[1:26:58] and tests but that doesn't have anything
[1:27:00] to do with it that only goes so far it
[1:27:02] can't touch that person that soul that
[1:27:05] word anointed and alive in your heart
[1:27:10] hallelujah
[1:27:12] hallelujah all right
[1:27:16] amen it's good to see our positive
[1:27:18] position
[1:27:19] amen in christ
[1:27:24] revealed in you identified you he
[1:27:26] identifies you and him the seal the
[1:27:28] token his own life identifies you and
[1:27:31] him
[1:27:32] then who is this devil that'll try to
[1:27:34] keep you from surrendering your all and
[1:27:36] completely submitting yourself to him
[1:27:39] who is this spirit anyway
[1:27:41] it's not god's spirit god wants you to
[1:27:43] surrender yourself just give yourself
[1:27:45] over to me let my word be your absolute
[1:27:52] who is this going to sit down and reason
[1:27:53] with you on it
[1:27:57] and then you fear your reasoning you
[1:27:59] fear your feelings it becomes an idol to
[1:28:01] you
[1:28:03] and you're bowing to that idol
[1:28:09] amen
[1:28:11] fear becomes your idol
[1:28:13] and it's an idolatrous spirit
[1:28:16] i preach that here i like to preach it
[1:28:18] again more depth
[1:28:20] amen because it's full of it it's a
[1:28:21] dominating female spirit today a
[1:28:24] denominational dominating spirit
[1:28:27] a church spirit
[1:28:30] that'll reason with god's word it's a
[1:28:31] denominational ungodly spirit
[1:28:38] amen
[1:28:40] that's heavy on my heart it's going to
[1:28:42] take up maybe two or three times to
[1:28:43] preach that i like to preach that
[1:28:44] message dominating
[1:28:48] because the catholic church is that and
[1:28:49] that's the spirit of it that's the
[1:28:51] dominating female
[1:28:54] because in the bible a woman's a church
[1:28:58] he is the word
[1:29:01] amen
[1:29:03] there is a true church but not that
[1:29:05] church because he wouldn't he doesn't
[1:29:06] even have an organization
[1:29:12] god never did start one
[1:29:15] god never did have one
[1:29:17] it come right out of the pits of babylon
[1:29:21] oh mother and her daughters
[1:29:25] if you want to take on their spirit
[1:29:26] you're going to question you're going to
[1:29:28] reason with the word
[1:29:29] you're not going to believe it
[1:29:31] you're going to put your own
[1:29:31] interpretation to it
[1:29:33] but if the holy ghost is in you you just
[1:29:35] start to do that and watch the holy
[1:29:37] ghost identify it
[1:29:39] i may say amen to that
[1:29:41] watch the holy ghost keep you because
[1:29:43] we're subject to that in our own minds
[1:29:46] but as soon but you can't in your soul
[1:29:48] disbelieve this word and you'll correct
[1:29:50] it don't reason with the devil well
[1:29:53] everybody else does this why can't i
[1:29:58] you're not everybody
[1:30:00] you're a very very few chosen in this
[1:30:02] hour it's going to come out of this hour
[1:30:04] as a bride
[1:30:06] that's how close it is
[1:30:08] the closeness of the two spirits isn't
[1:30:09] out here you in the world
[1:30:11] it's out here amongst the message it's
[1:30:14] right out here in church and it is the
[1:30:15] church spirit that's so close to the
[1:30:17] real
[1:30:21] it would deceive the elect if
[1:30:24] it were possible you see the seals
[1:30:26] opened up who you are where you come
[1:30:27] from and where you're going
[1:30:30] that's what the seals open for
[1:30:33] amen the book was sealed but when the
[1:30:35] book was unsealed it brought forth the
[1:30:38] finished work
[1:30:40] when the book was then the seal opened
[1:30:42] up it also told us who he owned
[1:30:46] and you were able to receive it when the
[1:30:48] book was when the seal was taken off
[1:30:50] what else did it do
[1:30:51] it showed your destiny you're sealed
[1:30:54] eternally
[1:30:56] and you're sealed right there in that
[1:30:59] and now you have that seal
[1:31:01] of that open word
[1:31:03] sealing you to your body change
[1:31:06] and you can't back up on this no matter
[1:31:08] what you do you can't leave it it can't
[1:31:11] leave you
[1:31:12] god's already done recognize you in
[1:31:14] christ
[1:31:16] you see did you get that what the seal
[1:31:17] denotes finished work ownership
[1:31:21] security
[1:31:23] all right so i'm not going to go in that
[1:31:24] i had a lot to take in that tonight but
[1:31:26] i'm not i'm just going to have to lay it
[1:31:27] out like that
[1:31:28] all right now i want to go over
[1:31:31] colossians a minute oh i didn't finish
[1:31:33] that scripture excuse me let's go verse
[1:31:35] 22
[1:31:38] no 21 now he which establisheth us i
[1:31:42] love that now he which establishes us
[1:31:45] with you
[1:31:47] in christ
[1:31:48] see your see your security
[1:31:50] where's your security where's what god's
[1:31:52] wanting to see the requirement that god
[1:31:55] requires today is you must have that
[1:31:58] token
[1:32:01] until the seals were open the token
[1:32:03] wasn't coming in full effect
[1:32:07] amen the holy ghost was present but not
[1:32:09] in full revelation
[1:32:11] the token is the full complete
[1:32:13] revelation and when you get in and you
[1:32:15] have that token it shows that you are
[1:32:17] ordained in a complete revelation you
[1:32:20] are a part of him
[1:32:22] a member of him a complete revelation of
[1:32:24] him that you're the mystery of god
[1:32:26] revealed
[1:32:31] amen
[1:32:33] all right now so he said who hath sealed
[1:32:36] us he established us with you in christ
[1:32:38] and anointed us he has anointed us this
[1:32:41] person anointed us is god
[1:32:43] verse 22 who hath also who hath also
[1:32:47] sealed us
[1:32:52] not only anointed you he sealed you
[1:32:54] identifying yourself as his possession
[1:32:57] his seed his life himself he wouldn't
[1:33:01] have put the seal on you except you were
[1:33:03] himself
[1:33:06] what a joy then what a rest
[1:33:09] face any trial you want to you can face
[1:33:11] it with a smile you can go you can have
[1:33:14] a smile in your trial
[1:33:18] because no matter what state you're in
[1:33:20] you can therewith be content
[1:33:24] all right amen
[1:33:26] amen trials are for your good they're
[1:33:28] not for your evil
[1:33:30] god knows how to temper you god knows
[1:33:31] how to get you to totally yield to him
[1:33:34] completely submit yourself to it
[1:33:37] amen that's what it is the key is total
[1:33:39] submission
[1:33:43] okay
[1:33:44] now i'm trying to move through this
[1:33:46] quickly
[1:33:47] now i want you go to colossians 3 3

[1:33:52] earnest of the spirit in our hearts what

[1:34:13] like shouting or dancing you're doing
[1:34:15] something
[1:34:17] but that's the truth
[1:34:19] whether you shout or dance is what is
[1:34:20] revealed in your soul
[1:34:22] it's that settlement
[1:34:24] don't you let the devil pull this wool
[1:34:26] over your eyes and start reasoning with
[1:34:28] you on the word just take what he said
[1:34:31] let go and let god be god just take him
[1:34:34] at his word

[1:34:42] so in that settle you hold that
[1:34:43] confession right there and go on i don't
[1:34:45] care how long it takes god knows how
[1:34:47] long it takes god will make it come to

[1:35:03] do it
[1:35:05] they said now that's my son
[1:35:07] he'll stand there no matter what's
[1:35:09] against him you're going to say but the

[1:35:34] we have to keep a certain certain time
[1:35:36] but i don't want to keep you all night
[1:35:37] either
[1:35:39] so colossians
[1:35:41] three
[1:35:44] and verse three now let's just take
[1:35:45] verse one if you be then risen with
[1:35:47] christ somebody's risen with christ how
[1:35:49] many know you're risen with christ
[1:35:52] risen already risen not you will rise

[1:36:15] immediately at his word come to him
[1:36:19] when he wants to correct you about
[1:36:20] you're taking too much time with other
[1:36:21] things not giving me enough time in
[1:36:23] prayer and the feeding of the word
[1:36:25] you've got other things that are more
[1:36:26] important in your life
[1:36:28] i wonder if you'll rise up and say yes
[1:36:30] lord
[1:36:32] help me
[1:36:33] cut away this thing cut away this
[1:36:35] barrier cut away this pleasure cut away
[1:36:37] this thing that's hindering me and
[1:36:39] standing in my way
[1:36:42] what's more important
[1:36:44] that carnal thing
[1:36:45] or going home
[1:36:55] colossians 3 3
[1:36:57] if you be the risen with christ seek
[1:36:58] those things which are below where
[1:37:00] carnally you can have your flesh
[1:37:02] satisfied
[1:37:03] that's not what it says
[1:37:09] i know it sounds funny but that's the
[1:37:11] truth
[1:37:12] you're doing that we've done that i've
[1:37:14] done that but thank god for the keeping
[1:37:16] power that'll re break you realize it
[1:37:18] and you stop it say god i don't want to
[1:37:20] be that way this is more important to me
[1:37:23] i need more of you
[1:37:25] give me a desperation in my heart
[1:37:28] put such a love in me that i'll be
[1:37:30] desperate to get out of here
[1:37:32] not worry about where the next money
[1:37:34] this worried about my job worried about
[1:37:35] this word about vaccine worry about this
[1:37:38] word all these are nothing but
[1:37:39] annoyances of the devil he puts it
[1:37:41] before you all the time as a son of god
[1:37:44] he puts a naked woman out in front of
[1:37:45] you you hear the music any store you
[1:37:47] want to go into a bunch of rock and roll
[1:37:49] beat that simply annoys you
[1:37:52] and you're bearing that annoying every
[1:37:54] day but that's as far as the devil can
[1:37:56] go he can only go to the outside man he
[1:37:59] can't reach you
[1:38:01] because when you're head away you're hid
[1:38:03] away you can't find you when you're
[1:38:05] sealed in the prophet said he is sealed
[1:38:08] out
[1:38:11] amen
[1:38:13] and facing
[1:38:14] as you ought to face him and quit
[1:38:17] listening to him say well you said this
[1:38:19] and you said that and you made this
[1:38:21] mistake and you that is not where i'm
[1:38:23] identified
[1:38:26] there's an outer man and there's an
[1:38:28] inside man
[1:38:31] that inside man is a new creature
[1:38:34] and he's this head of that new race
[1:38:37] and he's identified himself and me that
[1:38:39] i'm that creature i'm the beginner he
[1:38:41] was beginning of that creation and i'm
[1:38:43] one of those creations of god in flesh
[1:38:49] amen amen amen that said a mouthful
[1:38:52] right there
[1:38:54] all right
[1:38:56] let's just get down the brass tacks and
[1:38:58] we speak plainly
[1:39:00] okay
[1:39:00] i am eternal life
[1:39:02] amen
[1:39:03] he said oh brother david i know you're
[1:39:05] dying you can't you why you made
[1:39:06] yourself god you're just looking at the
[1:39:08] wrong side of the flesh
[1:39:10] i am that god i am that word i am
[1:39:15] eternal life inside of me that's who i
[1:39:18] am
[1:39:19] that's the holy ghost in me that's who i
[1:39:22] am
[1:39:23] you think that's strong i'm sorry but
[1:39:25] that's the word of the hour that's the
[1:39:27] revelation the bride speaks that's what
[1:39:30] she is and she's not ashamed of it
[1:39:35] and she'll line up with every word
[1:39:38] and it'll be manifested through her
[1:39:40] because if that spirit dwells in you
[1:39:42] that dwelled in jesus he that raised up
[1:39:44] christ shall also bring your mortal body
[1:39:47] subject to that spirit it'll make you
[1:39:49] walk different it'll make you talk
[1:39:51] different it'll make you live different
[1:39:52] it'll take the desires of the world out
[1:39:54] of you it'll take you women the desires
[1:39:56] of of the world to dress that sight so
[1:39:58] tight that it causes men to lust after
[1:40:00] you it'll take you away from putting on
[1:40:02] men's apparel
[1:40:08] you say that's harsh that's not harsh
[1:40:10] that's love on display
[1:40:13] trying to get you to look beyond
[1:40:15] trying you say well you offended me you
[1:40:17] offended me
[1:40:19] then jesus offended a lot of people
[1:40:22] because if i if that offends you
[1:40:24] that offense wasn't made just to offend
[1:40:26] you that was love to you to try to
[1:40:28] expose what spirit you're under so that
[1:40:30] you can be set free
[1:40:36] you just you put it the wrong way that
[1:40:38] spirit's not there i'm not saying that
[1:40:40] to defend anybody i'm saying it because
[1:40:42] i long to see you free
[1:40:44] everything you do even the clothes you
[1:40:46] wear is motivated by a spirit
[1:40:55] but against spirits principalities
[1:40:58] reasoning spirits organizational
[1:40:59] denominational spirits
[1:41:01] that have tried to infiltrate itself
[1:41:03] even in this church
[1:41:05] as long as we stand with this word that
[1:41:07] spirit's not going to come here
[1:41:09] i don't care what it is an adulterous
[1:41:12] perverted spirit is not going to have
[1:41:13] the right of way here
[1:41:15] you'll be corrected by the word you said
[1:41:16] here you'll be corrected
[1:41:18] that's all there is to it because the
[1:41:19] word will correct the air
[1:41:23] and when you've been around this message
[1:41:25] and you'll still leave your wife and
[1:41:26] marry another woman that has a husband
[1:41:28] that is an adulterous act
[1:41:30] the bible said he that marries her that
[1:41:32] is put away commits adultery
[1:41:35] she has a living husband and you and
[1:41:37] these these spirits are rampaging
[1:41:39] they're running around they're they're
[1:41:40] reasoning in this message around the
[1:41:43] message say it's okay it's okay
[1:41:45] you're putting your own thinking to it
[1:41:47] it's not okay because we had a prophet
[1:41:50] who had the word of the lord say it is
[1:41:52] an heir and it's an adulterous
[1:41:53] denominational spirit
[1:41:57] and it and you go to listening on that
[1:41:59] adulterous denominational uh fornicating
[1:42:02] spirit that comes across the pulpit
[1:42:04] outside of that word to reason with it
[1:42:06] you'll go out there and commit it in the
[1:42:07] natural side of your own bodies
[1:42:11] tell me that's not right
[1:42:12] i know it's right
[1:42:16] if you want to get right then
[1:42:18] confess you're wrong and forsake that
[1:42:20] wrong
[1:42:23] and you'll be forgiven
[1:42:26] amen is that right that's scripture
[1:42:28] all right

[1:45:35] going all the time because you're in a
[1:45:37] battle did you
