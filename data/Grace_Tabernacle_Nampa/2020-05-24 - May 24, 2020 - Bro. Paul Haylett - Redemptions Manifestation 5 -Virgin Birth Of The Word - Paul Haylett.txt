how beautiful heaven must be home of the happy I'm free my the way how beautiful heaven must be brings great joy to my heart Saints to know we will see how beautiful heaven is hallelujah be a part of this great plan of God to see the word coming to pass in us amen everything that's happening you know sometimes we go through things in life and we wonder am i what was that about you know kind of a little tornado so to speak hits your life but you know down the road somewhere you realize this is what it was about God preparing us for those things that we're coming to the things that we face amen and you know I think it I think it's wonderful what God is doing in our lives so good to see each and every one of you today amen you know God's grace and mercy is sufficient I was just sitting there on the Pew thinking about my brother Bob and sister Joanne and you know praise the Lord if the Lord tarries Saints now I'm not lifting up individuals right because we believe this is the same God in us but I'll tell you if the Lord tarries I be Amen sorry brother Bob's sister Joanne I want to be old and still be in the house of God raising my hands singing songs and worshiping amen amen I don't want to just drift off on the Prairie as it were and disappear out of sight I want to be right to the last breath that's in my body in the house of God amen you know as we kind of slot 'red it a little bit of what our brother Danny fare but my brother and sister if we don't declare church as essential amen then the world will determine what is essential and I'm telling you it's essential and I need it I want it I desire it and I say God bring it upon us everything that's necessary Alleluia well I sent a little word to brother Sergei this morning and and just you know just a little remembrance for my friend and brother and and they were in the car traveling and I don't know I guess it's something of youth that I have forgotten but he said well I made a call man brother Alex driving must be a little scary because everybody just looks so solemn and he said no we didn't go to bed till 2:00 a.m. and I'm like my oh my I am certainly have passed over a transition I am no longer a young person because 2 a.m. is what you do in an emergency alleluiah not for fun but in an emergency hallelujah but we just want to remember them they were driving down into Kentucky to go worship with a little group of believers there today and there ahead of us so no doubt they're already in service but just to lift them up before the Lord that God would just bless the Saints wherever they are at are you blessed today Saints amen let's just stand and go to the word now I'm going to speak some things today that I certainly hope that you're patient and understanding with me might be a little direct but I believe if you'll approach it God will anoint you to approach it and the way that we were looking at it it won't be it won't be wrong but my brother and sister I'll just have to share this with you so as our brother Chris was preaching uh I guess that would be to Wednesdays ago as he was preaching he just got started with his service and I just got under such an inspiration I I'm not saying this is how we should do things but I just pulled a clean piece of paper out of my little folder there and I just started writing and I guess I don't want to some boastful but I guess I caught a little of the vein that brother Chris was preaching in but you know I took a little parallel route to it and I just wrote down this and then as we kind of been studying this for a week and a half I just want to bring out the virgin birth of the word Amen hallelujah not something convoluted not something hybrid now I cut a lot of quotes out I was joking with brother J do we have an hour service hour and a half to two and a half three five brother J I'll just say this brother J gave me permission to preach until my voice quit and I'm feeling pretty good today the virgin birth of the word let's turn in Matthew the first chapter verse 18 now we don't want to look my brother and sister at the Bible as a historic writing this is living here today amen Jesus Christ the same yesterday today and forever and you know sometimes I struggle with the idea that people around the message struggle with the idea when even in the denominations in Pentecost apostolic they have no problem embracing the fact of the word being alive and the word being God and the word being in US and yet some people around the message struggle with that because there's been some lack of teaching or revelation somewhere along the line now the birth of Jesus Christ was on this wise when as his mother Mary was espoused to Joseph before they come together before there was ever any carnal or natural or intellectual she was found with child of the Holy Ghost then Joseph her husband being a just man not willing to make her a public example was minded to move to another city under another circumstance to hide the shame it's what it says isn't it but it's what it meant see people also around the message struggle brother Branham in several places says now you heard what I said I hope you see what I meant so we need to come not with our own thinking not with our own I'm going to interpret this but to realize the prophet of God says not everything that is a visible to us is manifested so God has to come down and he has to open our eyes as we read the word of God as we listen to a prophets voice we can't just say okay I'm gonna I've God no we need to say Lord now what he's saying I need to catch the meaning of this I need to understand what it is what is veiled in what is written Amen not everybody agrees with that and I'm not here to pick a fight with that but I for one believe when the prophet of God said pray for revelation that ought to be a first and foremost thing that you do that we take the Prophet at his word and pray for revelation amen now this and we're going to hit on a few things today this is not revelation of some man in a pulpit Saints I want to admonish you right now don't you ever take Paul's interpretation of this message or any man right we're relying on the Holy Ghost hallelujah then Joseph her husband being a just man not willing to make her a public example in other words publicly shame her away privately or privily but while he thought on these things the angel of the Lord appeared unto Him in a dream saying Joseph thou son of David fear not see is talking here he's in the lineage that's all the more that's here is declaring to him you're in the lineage of David you're not a castaway you're not as it were a dog from the gutters you are of the very lineage of God fear not to take unto thee Mary thy wife for that which is conceived in her is of the Holy Ghost and she shall bring forth a son and thou shalt call his name Jesus for he shall save his people from their say now all of this was done that it might be fulfilled which was spoken of the Lord by the Prophet saying behold a virgin shall be with child and shall bring forth a son and they shall call his name Emmanuel which being interpreted God with us hallelujah then Joseph being raised from sleep did as the angel of the Lord had bidden him and took unto him his wife now my brother and sister you'll catch this in verse 25 but when he took unto his wife he then made a commitment that was not based in the physical because verse 25 shows us that he knew her not till she brought her firstborn son and called his name Jesus but what it was is he received oh you might stumble it when I'm fixing to tell you he received the revelation of the angel that came to him and he realized this is my wife was to be my wife but now I'm receiving a revelation that was brought to me he had to my brother and sister he had to stop and decide if the words of this Amos dream coming to him if this was true or not but there was something there by which he could say I believe this and then he went in and fully embraced Mary no reservation no sorry to put it in these words no hanky-panky no mystery as to what's going on here I'm gonna waitin to see no he received her he took her then unto himself as his wife that was a committal hallelujah father we thank you today lord your grace your mercy your hand upon our lives father truly Lord revealed to us today Lord the hidden meaning of your word father that that was hid from the wise and the prudent Lord that was hidden from Father the intellectual hidden father from those that Lord only saw it as a source of influence father let your word be living in us today let this Bible come living Lord let each one of us from the oldest to the youngest today be able to just open our hearts today and just receive your word and father come and vindicate your word father let it not be our words not be just trust us Lord we trust you Lord that's what we trust we trust your word Lord asking for your hand today upon every need upon everyone in the body and the bride of Jesus Christ amen you may be seated Saints as I said we're going to look at a few things today and I will make some statements no doubt unless the Lord checks me different that will come across and I pray that you're able just to to understand where I am at amen let's look at Mary for just a minute my brother and sister here is a young girl she's been raised correctly she's obviously pure and holy because God would not choose a just any old girl you might say off the alleys for this and and she was there I believe having as I study the word I believe she had a experience with God and in that there must have been some faith that allowed her to reach out in take a Holtz of what would be beyond the extraordinary beyond the you know mind could grasp how that an angel would come to her and be speaking and declaring to her so we would understand I believe by looking at the word that Mary did not have an intellectual understanding she was not there trying to measure I don't think her mind raced back to the prophets of old and said well this has got to be a scriptural fulfilled I guess I would be the girl but my brother and sister the prophet of God talks about how that the word having declared that a virgin would conceive that no doubt many people fathers and mothers might think my daughter might be one she's a godly girl my daughter might be one that God would choose - to do this but you see we need to be looking we need to have expectations but my brother and sister we also need to just simply stop and say Lord thy will be done whatever it is you want me to fulfill whatever my part of the plan of God is we can't run around am i a preacher am i evangelist am i this am i that we have to just kind of you might say just live life and say lord thy will be done to guide me into what you desire for me and so as Mary's living out her life this day comes and she comes in the presence of an angel and my brother and sister when this angel speaks to her Mar it was not as though she said okay now can you give me some documentation and my brother and sister you know it's an interesting thing that sometimes you know around the message if I'm if we don't quantify it brother Branham said people can reject what is said because they need brother Branham said on there but what we really need is to be so close to God that when we hear the preaching of the word it's connected or stirred right to our heart not to our brain hey man so that we don't have to critique this does this fit do I remember a quote is there a sermon what do we have here my brother and sister the day may come that we will no longer have a message book or a computer we might not have a Bible the only place the word will be recorded then is down in your soul hey man and God promised he said that he would bring it to our remembrance he would bring it to our lips in the time of need amen so we got to get beyond I can find it on my phone hallelujah amen many times things come and her preached and in people back up from it I won't go into the details but I can just tell you there's a brother one time he was preaching in and you know he said in a service he said you know dah dah dah dah dah dah dah dah he didn't say brother brems head and people box against aft they sent him texts and emails we don't believe that and the very next service the brother gets up and says for those of you and then he reads it brother branham says right here in this sermon now my brother and sister I think it shows a critical flaw that when you could instinctively say I don't believe that and then the minute brother branham said oh yes isn't that beautiful there's a flaw and I'll tell you my brother and sister submarines I studied them kind of a little historical thing I like to read about and I was reading about submarines and you know some of the original submarines my brother and sister the poor men who felt honored at the moment to test them their bones still lie in them at the bottom of the ocean because there was a critical flaw in some cases you know they made the hole to be able to withstand so many a amounts of pressure per square inch thousands of pounds per square inch of pressure but they had a valve and in one case one of those submarines it was the door where they shot the trash out while they were in the ocean it grounded up and shot it out that door couldn't handle the pressure and so there might be some little thing in your life in my life that we would say here well praise the Lord understand the message of the Lord this is all good but if we have a little door to the heart a little door to the mind a little door to whatever emotion and it won't stand the pressure it's gonna blow up on you and so God is what is he doing hallelujah is pressurizing us that's why we have these little struggles we have little trials we have little things that happen in our life what's he doing he's pressurizing us but by the grace of God my brother and sister we're getting to try this all out while there's still a lifeguard on duty hallelujah so you look at this and realize that Mary had no documentation she did not have a Bible she did not have a message she did not have some kind of scroll to go back and go now has God ever done this before this the way God works is could this possibly be you know something else it's not the angel of the Lord but what it was is doing I'm what is fixing to happen here my brother and sister she had none of that but I'll tell you what she had she had some preparation for the pressure that came into her life because that pressure my brother and sister included that while she was there living her life in amongst her own friends they started to say whom what's Mary been up to there's a little problem in this relationship and it's even a bigger problem because Joseph is gonna go ahead and marry her which means he's breaking the bridal covenant well you know what it was if a bride went into the bridal tent under the bridal covenant and was found not to be a virgin its death it wasn't well just the way the times are it's just how life is no my brother and sister was death now you see God had to come down because Joseph himself had to come and accept publicly Mary to take away but yet the shame did not disappear are you with me but Joseph anointed here once again no documentation no quote no Scripture nothing to fall back on but the fact that he knew that was the angel of the Lord that spoke to someone else no it spoke to him and that's where we must get today my brother and sister in the age the day that we live in it's not now don't misunderstand me I get people say brother Paul we don't like how you speak down on the Prophet I'm not speaking down on the Prophet my brother and sister I believe the greatest compliment we can give to our brother William Branham is living this message not that we walk around all politically correct all the time of us say only in Studdard of when he did my brother's sister that's not the compliment that's not the lifting up my brother's sister the lifting up is day by day my day looking at this and saying I believe what he preached and I took it back the word and the word agrees and we stand with confidence because our prophet brought a restored word to us all this faults my brother and sister I'm sorry but that's just how I see it all this faults politically correct world we live in has got inside our message boat it's time to forget them politically correct this that and we're afraid to say it's time for us to say this is the word God sent it Malachi 4:5 revelation said behold I send you didn't say behold I'll send a prophet some people he said people I've sent you a prophet that will restore you black hallelujah I don't know how I got on that subject praise the Lord but you see Mary had no documentation to go to no reference no concordance no quote books but something in her heart oh I just love that it's in Luke 1 in 38 let's just pop that up on the screen here Luke 1 in 38 this is Mary's response to the supernatural unexpected event in her life she didn't say I got to think about this I gotta go Sri search this I gotta go after the priest what he thinks about this that's something in her heart she said Behold the handmaid of the Lord see she was identified already she said I am a handmaid of the Lord I know who I am a man and because she knew who she was she was able then to receive the word of the Lord be it unto me according to thy word can we say that this morning being unto me according to thy word my brother and sister that'll go a long ways towards wrinkling out of ironing out the wrinkles in our lives because when we'll get in a place that we absolutely know who we are and where we stand in this word of God my sister you won't have to stop and say is this going to lead me away now I'm sorry I'm gonna beat this drum a little bit more but people think I'm overly confident in fact they called it a liberal of view on we cannot be deceived I'm sorry my brother and sister I don't know how we can take a liberal view on being deep when the word said it would deceive the very elect if it were possible now is a question mark whether God can sustain his word or is a question mark whether were the elect she answered the question behold the handmaid of the Lord she knew this the position I am this is who I am she didn't say if I am a handmaid of the Lord I am a handmaid of the Lord and we need to have enough confidence today my brother and sister and if we don't have that confidence we're not digging in the word deep enough you're just floating along on that little stream of life and you're saying well praise the Lord God sent a prophet get through that get through that and know who you are in the word there's no prophet I'm sorry to tell you there's no prophet can come on the scene and convince you of who you are in the word the words are there he okay he gave us a research he gave us a documentation gave us everything we need many of you don't get in it and you don't eat it you don't consume it you don't believe it you don't submit to it then you'll come to the day that you'll put an F in front this equation if I am the elect come on let's get in the word saints let's eat the carcass start chewing on it know who you are then you see you don't have to have fear of whether you'll be deceived or not because God made that promise to who the bride you you so he made that promise to you can't deceive the very elect Amen whole hallelujah well I might be a liberal anyway you all call me a liberal call me liberal but I believe it God said it I'm gonna hang my whole life over the chasm amen brother Chris preached about the bridge that was my brother and sister I'll hang my life off of that bridge I'll stand in the middle of that bridge over that chasm and I will say thank you Lord for the bridge that you have built and the fact that you guided me to be able to cross that bridge you gave me the strength to climb up you gave me the strength and the courage to press on and see the vision of what was beyond oh but if you stand there and say I don't know I don't know if that bridge is going to handle all these cares and terrors of life well my brother's sister you can stand there go ahead hire an engineer that engineer will probably tell you the days of miracles are past that engineer will probably tell you that God's just here and he's full of grace and you just live like you want to live III just this is weird how things are but as I was studying I looked up a little something on my computer and the sidebar do any of you know how to permanently eliminate them anyway it caught my attention I think the Lord had it for a reason Christian singles well it's not for me I will go through the name there's a picture quite pretty woman probably about 40 years old Christian likes to cook clean hike drink wine prophet warned us about that didn't he I won't go into all the rest of details but you see my brother and sister that's not what we were called to we were called to stand up and say be it a court be it unto me according to who is she speaking to not even the angel oh I want you to grip that get ahold of that she wasn't saying amen to the angel she was talking bright back the angel brought the message oh oh I hope you get this this morning the angel brought the message but he spoke back to God hallelujah I wish some people would get that revelation amen we didn't have to speak back as it were to the angel we had to speak back to God amen hallelujah oh look at this now see so she was there you know that that brings to mind to me it's always a just a little source of humor I hope you would see this our brother David Nash for years I've known him since I was a roughly 14 years old a long time Wow but uh um you know he always sang that song let your word be born in the manger of my heart and I went for about 30 years thinking that brother David had written that song I was like that song that brother David wrote it one time I made that comment to brother David I'd like you to sing that song that you wrote and he just looked at me I was like oh what songs that I know you know the one about the manger huh sorry brother Paul that's not my song really I've went 30 years thinking that brother David Rohtang but then I stopped and I thought it doesn't matter that song touched my heart for 30 years hey man I didn't matter who wrote it let your word be born in the manger my heart turned the song into a prayer my brother and sister hallelujah now for there to be a birth of the word where there would be a birth of anything one must first be pregnant you see God follows the law my brother and sister you say what God follows the law yes God set the law of nature the law of humanity etc and he give these principles and God will not break his own principles that's why we can carry these things that's why the prophet of God shows us we can carry these things and I'm a typology we can carry these things through the Bible with confidence because God will not break his principle now I'm sorry to beat on this my brother and sister but I just it is just something that just galls me uh you know there's things that that are right in there question answers 1964 someone said well brother randomly was this situation before we come in and can we still preach was divorced and remarried and can we still preach and brother Branham says no moment take you over here to Timothy read those scriptures that they're there let's go to Titus read those scriptures no you can't but yet that spirit is so subtly they'll come down to what brother Branham preached and marriage and divorce and when he says God's forgiven you as though it never happened they they go oh I can preach now my brother and sister you see how slippery this is amen we introduce something and we go back we have quotes for it we've got one single scripture for it amen we can't lining up in continuity to the Word of God but we say all this is revelation if it is a revelation then God changed his principle and my God does not change now look I'm not going to beat around the bush we had those around us just here recently that held on to that how did that supported that it went to other countries and supported that and I'm gonna stand up and declare that came right out of the pits of hell that is not the message you cannot take a convolution of words and change the scripture and expect God to honor it now I know that's kind of blunt and I'll probably get some feedback on that I've been getting a lot of feedback lately my brother and sister but I'll tell you about I got more feedback when the Lord said I told you to preach it you preach it and I'll stand on that why you say brother Paul why are you preaching that because my brother and sister the baby wolf that you took in and fed at your hearth and at your table grows up to be a full-grown wolf and that full-grown wolf looks at your wife and your children and your husband and your daddy has lunch what was so cute and so friendly and so fuzzy and only bit a little here and a little there and only had that gleam in its eye once in a while will destroy your family and I hate to say this but I was listening to a Pentecostal preacher a couple years ago and it struck me deep oh I know some of you might be disturbed about that but the guy's a really good preacher and he's not well anyway no I'm not telling you who it is but he made a statement that struck me I've spoken over the pulpit here he said if God is not moving in your church pastor you are obligated to God to find out why not oh come on Saints I don't care it came from some Pentecostal preacher that's their truth it doesn't land with sister Nadia or someone else or in this brother that when it lands with myself brother David brother Chris if we don't find out why God it's not moving in our midst we will stand the judgment I don't want to stand that judgment I'd rather dig and root and make people upset with me and you know I scrub says you offend one of those little ones my brother and sister now I don't want to do that but the prophet of God also said the word cannot offend the word amen so look it's time for us to look in our own life look in our church and say if God's not moving here the Saints we gonna start rooting and we're gonna start figuring out not just a church but in our house and if we were afraid to root that deep then we weren't called for the job we just got up and went hallelujah hallelujah now look if you fire me don't forget that there was a clause that there was there you know where you had to give me a compensation when I left I shouldn't joke about that but I just see the bad humor for there to be a birth of the word there must first be a pregnant hey man my brother and sister now look I don't want to we got young people here and I'm not trying to be crass or anything but I just want you to understand just feel the need to just put this right out my brother and sister this pregnant doesn't come by shaking hands it does not come by rubbing elbows it doesn't come by sitting on the Pew come on let me drive this home to you my brother and sister amen it happens with a personal intimate relationship Oh y'all brother Paul you're getting a little personal yeah I'm getting a little personal cuz I'll go a step further these little kids aren't in this church because some people lived in the same house come on let's not act like oh this is nature it's how God created us but hey man you didn't have a husband and a wife rubbing elbows at the kitchen table and her one day say I think I'm gonna have a baby amen and you don't come to the house of God and rub elbows and one day say I think I'm pregnant with the Word of God amen there's got to be something deeper than just coming and sitting on a Pew and saying I belong to grace hallelujah must be something more than coming I'll tell you what's happened my brother and sister he's in the house he's in the house are you with me he's in the house it's time to get intimate it's time to step over that and quit having a impersonal relationship with Jesus Christ well I believe in God I love the Lord Jesus I do all of this my brother and sister I'll tell you what there is no such thing as a half-hearted relationship with God you have a relationship or you don't hey man it's either intimate or it's not now I hope that's not too personal for you I looked at that and I thought Lord do I dare say it about these little children it sounds like we're talking about the carnal my brother and sister amen God intended in the garden for the spoken word to bring Adam and Eve offering but we're in a fallen state and we have no problem understanding in the natural what it takes to bring four children and God put that great desire in the heart of mothers amen of sister to want to have a child to go through that travail even under the influence of the curse and we are there in the natural saying yes we want a family well God wants a family God's got a family amen and that family is not afraid to be intimate that family is not afraid to as it were right the three room house they're not going to just sit in the kitchen rub elbows at the table not gonna sit in the living room and hold hand there comes a day pardon for saying it but there comes a day that desire takes them to the bedroom and they consummate the relationship to bring forth what God called them to bring forth oh and we got way too many believers want to sit around the living room now don't misunderstand me but they want to sit around the living room and strum on the guitar they want to go over here and do this they want to go over there and do that but I want to ask you have you been to the bedroom come on he's in the house Saints amen oh this intimate relationship pregnant a word in us to bring forth Christ in the flesh Oh hallelujah this is not Christ just in the spirit realm my brother and sister right some people struggle I think around the message we still got people they don't have God head straightened down they that looks like well we got the Holy Ghost that's right that's God in you don't look it up that's what the prophet of God says it's not just some part Amen said it right here over the pulpit one not open Sunday God in you people got upset with me if God's in me where's he at my brother and sisters something's missing from the understanding Amen because a prophet of God himself said the Holy Ghost is God in you hallelujah it's time we just knock off the fetters knock off all the shackles knock off all the yokes my brother and sister and preach this message because time is wrapping up hallelujah might bury me as an old man but still the word has to be laid in place to be built upon hallelujah what is this to bring forth Christ in the flesh once again except for I didn't want to preach all day I've got so many quotes no brother David it's not justification to preach forever and ever I just put humor and that don't take that serious so many quotes my brother and sister did you just have to pass on that pass on that would pass on how and that right brother David pass on that one pass on that one pass on that one that's an hour's worth pass on that one pass on that that's another hours worth pass on that one pass on uh yeah come on we might laugh about it Saints but it's the truth there's power in this word this message is not a dead letter that started to be preached back in the forties this message is alive and well today there is the power of Almighty God in his word here today whoa can you back that up brother Paul I sure can but you don't have enough time Alleluia will be will we be reading quotes in heaven you know the reason I ask that is that's how long it would take to get through all of them yeah I'm not trying to just be funny why because these are not just quotes this is the word oh come on I saw this a little example just struck my heart sending it to supper table last night seems like yesterday was a long time ago my daughter Kristen she cut up a little bit of that venison roast that they shared with us hmm can't tell you how good that was but we don't talk about food she cut it up in little chunks and she put some of it on declan's tray in his highchair and I was kind of I don't know I'm getting old I'm chunks look big and she sure gave him a lot of them and he's only got two little teeth in and I and then something crossed my mind it's not your baby old man it's not your baby just leave it to mama and so he's there and it's all in a little stack and he reaches out there and he grabs all of them and I'm like I can't I can own up he's right here beside now no way I'm letting him put all of them in his mouth but you know little guy he drops all but one of them before he gets them off the tray and they're just and he shoves that one in his mouth and I'm all ready to stick my finger in there and pry that thing jerky mouth a highchair papa and he starts the gum in that thing I kid you not Saints he closed his eyes and we're hmm then he picked up another one and ate it even faster and he picked up the other one and ate it even faster picked up the last one and ate it faster amen hallelujah can somebody say thank you Lord hallelujah Oh somebody said well we gonna water the word down for you no you don't I was he quipped hallelujah to eat this word hey man I don't need old man over here to tell me what I can and can't do in the Lord and I'll tell you Saints I like us as a minister as a pastor I like it when I look out there and I see the Saints just God mmm mmm mmm that was can I have some more hallelujah spoken word is the original seed hallelujah Oh people god bless you hear me now you know the problem we've lost my brother and sister is that so many people have turned brother Branham into the kind old priest I'm sorry to tell you our prophet is not the kind old priest Alleluia could not be anointed with the spirit of Elijah and be the kind old priest I can't believe nothing but God's Word I want it to be my life everything that I am and I want you to do the same let your walks your talks your moves everything you do be in the Word of God oh I know some people get angry with me they don't like me putting it this way but my brother and sister I'll just tell you where I stand when he said let it be in the Word of God he was talking about this not to take the first two lines out of this quote jump five years take the last two lines out of that quote jump two years and take the middle of lines out of another quote say this is what the Prophet meant take it back to the word amen let the mind of Christ come into you and that'll pregnat you with the word o now pardon me I ain't gonna be able to do this I am getting too old but when he said let the mind of Christ be into you he's not talking about this I feel I feel yes I feel somebody help me up Thank You brother ever what Saints let's get over this yeah we have feelings I have feelings you guys hurt my feelings you hurt my feelings more often than you know but I have to get over my feelings yes my feelings will never take me where I am going my feelings will never get me to the altar will never get me to the throne will never get me to the Sea of crystal will never get me to see how beautiful heaven must be my feelings will lie to me though the scripture says that our heart is deceitful whoa let the mind of Christ come in to you you know what the only way you're gonna get into the mind of Christ you're gonna have to spend enough time with them now let's just bring a natural type to this it's crazy how this whole married thing works right I mean my goodness Geri and I look back and I'm thinking my goodness this girl she's like I was this way when you married me oh she still I'm telling you sticks her chin out and everything I was his way when you married me don't you be trying to change me now then she looks at me and goes my goodness if I had only known what I was marrying but then she corrects herself and says well I did pray about it I asked her did the Lord actually answer that prayer though now come on Saints for the mind of Christ again in us we have to spend enough time with Christ that we can understand him it's so funny sit in a restaurant older couple setting a couple tables over this in Hawaii when god bless Terri and I with the love a keishon there and the waitress comes up and says sir what would you like to drink and he's like and his cute little wife there probably about 75 years old he wants a strawberry lemonade he never said a word just mmm the way he slurp down that strawberry lemonade that you knew that's what he wanted it he wasn't impact here you know he didn't have a domineering wife he just was gonna through the whole list and finally go I think I'll settle for a strawberry lemonade she saved a lot of time let the mind of Christ come into you and that'll pregnat you with the word now look III I'm just full of ambition this morning my brother and sister it ain't what brother so-and-so taught us for 25 30 40 years no that ain't going to get us into the world oh but I said under this ministry and I said under that ministry and I would never forsake those ministries because they were my whole founder maybe you need to maybe the time has come for you to forsake all of that and get in to the mind of Christ hallelujah hallelujah let the mind of Christ come into you and that'll pregnat you with the word if you don't if you let the mind of the denomination come in you'll be denominational pregnant if you let the mind of Christ come into you he can't deny his own cuz he's gone hallelujah I want his mind my brother and sister because then he can't deny me so I've got to do is die to myself submit myself to my husband amen and move right to that position and he could no more reject me than the reason the prophet of God shows us that Adam could not reject Eve hallelujah Christ wouldn't reject us because we'll have his mind hallelujah hey man he can't deny his own word cuz he's God you be pregnant with the word and believe it and I don't care if they put you out kick you out run you out every door is closed you'll do just the same amen whoo I got to hurry now ah yeah I don't know if the Prophet said it just like that but I'm inspired amen what Christ is now taking himself a bride to be pregnant with his own seed word in her womb spirit womb in her mind and won't mix with any the denominational trash with it I say that's worth I thank you Lord amen that's what God's looking for Saints amen we away too much in some sysm stuff showing up around our message Amen people well I think this and I think that I think the word is true you want my opinion the word is truthful and you want my opinion I believe that word and even if I struggle to understand I'm still gonna tell you I believe it hallelujah oh you're crazy you're right I'm crazy amen now look I saved that last few words right there what does all this do makes her a virgin to him now see there's a whole lot of stuff and I've heard people they got a backtrack I don't know why it is that people are like well you know this is this and this but this over here and that and this and that net why don't you just say amen to the word just believe this part God will take care of all the rest of that stuff hallelujah oh the prophet of God I can just see it now the minds are worrying you know well the prophet of God talked about how we were married amen before and were divorced and we were then but with our kinsman redeemer and so the Prophet is a prophet he confused somebody's confused is it us come on somebody help courage no is the answer good I know it was hard getting it out brother Tim but go ahead just shake it enough it flies right out of there amen reminds me some brothers talking one time of a minister and the message of preaching he got all excited and he made a point or I and his dentures come out and he just reached out there grabbed those things shoved them back in and kept right on preaching come on time for us to get over all of our little whoo-hoo I don't know I'm in church I'm afraid to answer I'm afraid to nod my head is the preacher is the pastor tricking me yeah I want to trick you right to the altar to repent and ask the Lord to fill you up with the Holy Ghost no that's not trickery that's a job Alleluia what does this do my brother and sister getting the mind of Christ to come into you he can't deny his own word this is turning oh my brother and sister this is not like the Follis ism where they'll sprinkle a little water say a few words and tell a woman you're a virgin again you can go get remarried this is a virgin to Christ amen what's that mean we're pure we're holy we're sealed I had to cut those quotes about being sealed out because I knew we didn't have a time today but my brother and sister you are sealed the prophet of God brings that out look it up he says that's because it's a finished work hallelujah amen maybe this ought to be a Merry kind of moment be it unto me Lord according to thy word amen let that happen to me now look I just want to go on I got quite a few quotes here and we'll just go until we feel like we should stop now look there was three women these three women typed here churches the woman always types churches it means three denominational ages carriers which also must die and dry up just like the shock and so forth does to give room for the seed oh my brother and sister the seed can all get right cannot get ripe rather until the stalk shock I mean the shuck the stalk and the leaves are all dry look Church I'm not looking for a bunch emotional people for the sake of us jumping up and down but if I see us drying up there's something wrong we are seed we are not shocked we are not the stalk we are not the leaves come on Saints that God worked and I knew time went by I knew that I had to make that right with brother Ted and I kept saying Lord I thought I've got to go to Arizona I need to stand face to face no telephone thing none of this modern modern watered-down hybrid Christian I'm leaving your church sinned come on where's the courage that men got where's the courage where people will stand up and express their convictions people leave Church don't say a word I'll tell you my brother and sister they say you were my pastor no I wasn't no I'm not venting this for my sake in case somebody's thinking that you see it's a position brother Ted went up North Idaho went hunting with No Baldwin brother Jeff Baldwin coming down through town we were having a church picnic at the park over here my phone dings this brother Ted hey brother Paul no it's too late to make it to church but just wondering if I could make up meet up with you to say hi today I was like hallelujah come on here's the dirt and he's like oh I remember the park he come there gets out of his car I ran over I'll tackle him brother Ted but Ted you gotta forgive me I can't brother Paul cuz I forgave you 18 years ago then he got a smile on his face and said I always knew it was in there come on Saints we didn't have that kind of confidence in the word disrespectful this that and the other no I knew it was in you and I prayed that way that was the thing that broke me down and made me just turn just melt down in tears he said I prayed that God would reveal it sooner than later [Music] hallelujah see it saps a bit of the life what's happening my brother and sister the bride the seed Jean wheat is sucking the life out of the shock the stalk and the leaf let me rise sometimes they don't like us come on you know how it is you get around people in the natural and they just seem to suck the life out of you well quite a few people suck the humor out of me we won't go there excuse me I mean I woke up in a good mood this morning Saint went to bed you know last night is going to thank you lord love you Lord forgive me Lord for being weak and all these other things and I got up this morning hallelujah I'm ready to take on the world can't do it now it's seed time or bride time this shot they're dead the shocks are dried up the virgin were time not touched Oh hallelujah not touch it's a virgin remember a virgin word time if you to put it in the hands of a denomination it sure wouldn't be virgin it'd be men handle time you get to it but God's church amen who are we talking to hey man who we talking to today God's church is not touched by denomination hallelujah it's a virgin born Word of God made manifest now my brother and sister it could be all of that but if it wasn't made manifest it would not fulfill the prophecy of the word the word said it had to come back because every seed will bring forth of its own kind we planted the seed nothing happened oh well no there's something wrong amen something wrong you put that seed in the right place do you think God knew where to plant the seed I don't mean nothing by this but Saints come on did God know where to plant the seed God knew where to plant the seed he didn't go plant it out here on his sidewalk somewhere Amen he didn't go plant it in the heart of an atheist because if he did it wouldn't be an atheist it'd be a believer am i preaching too hard this morning virgin-born Word of God made manifest Jesus Christ the same yesterday today and forever hallelujah how one love it I believe it I know that it's the truth it's not to be touched there'll be no denominational manhandling in the virgin birth of the bride Oh hallelujah my brother and sister I want you to think about this go back to Mary here's Mary the prophet of God broke the word down the egg that was in Mary my brother's sister that was not Mary's egg amen and the germ seed that come to Mary to fertilize or pregnat that egg that was not the seed of a man amen it was God's seed it was placed in the egg it was God's Eidos placed in the germ of life right my life is in the mail the blood is in the mail hallelujah the blood is not in the female and that's why we can't have any dominating female spirit in the church because the life is not in the female the life than male the female receives seed come on my brother and sister I don't say this to offend anybody but I'll tell you what we're gonna sweep out every corner every cobweb everything we're gonna get this and get right back on the right track hey man I don't care how small the spider is if it's in my house he's toast I know it's the truth is not to be touched there'll be no denominational manhandling in the virgin birth of the bride look Saints I don't say this on my defense but to make a point to you I don't believe and if I ever did I repent of it right now I've never come and told you you must believe this and you must believe that you know why because you see if I start telling you what to eat and how to eat it and when to eat it and when you have had enough a man handling you [Music] you see I'll give you the liberty to say brother Paul I don't agree with you I'm not gonna kick you out I'm not gonna treat you under the table my brother and sister but the Word of God will correct us amen because we cannot be deceived he will correct us amen so they ain't gonna be any man out here handling this virgin birth of this bride amen is how to pull the rabbit fur and all of those things out of our nest come on somebody say Amen you know I'm telling you the truth because what God's gonna do my brother's sister is not leave you there as the cartoon Baldy had that one little eagle in there amen he was fat took up 2/3 of the nest always sit there with his mouth open huh come and feed me my brother and sister there comes a time that an eagle will be there and say you know what okay there's an instinct in me amen you know I sit in church for a season I'm talking about me I said in church for a season and whatever I got from God was because some Minister led of God come down and laid it on the table in front of me and I was eating it and you know it was good it was nourishing amen but still I wasn't doing one single thing for myself I hope that I'm not talking about you today I didn't read my Bible I didn't study the message I didn't pray I just went to church with my wife she was the godly one amen and I just rode she knew what she was married to I found every reason well you know soul and soul wants to take time off I worked for a cattle outfit at the time song so wants to take time while honey I'm sorry I got to work this weekend after a while amen I don't think it was a dominating female spirit but after a while she started calling me on it you really have to work oh yeah so-and-so said there's no one else there you had to work um yeah yeah come on our story gets spin after a while yes so thin that most everybody can look right through it come on Saints I'm not here to insult or whatever but let's just get real with ourselves our story gets thin after a while you ever noticed we manage to do everything we want to do come on Oh skip your story Paul go back to the word see here's this eagle been fed everything gaining some strength there's an instinct in him very soon he's not sitting in the bottom of the nest pretty soon it's perched on the side of the nest and you know something's happen in them feathers start to pop out all the little fuzzy comfortable stuff starts to go away and feathers start coming out and something starts happening that eagle he sits in the nest now look I want you to understand that Eagle that little igloo it's a firm grip on the nest but he's standing there back to me so I don't offend anyone I did a lot of flapping and I had to start doing the flapping before I come back in the house of God because I thought I'd be like a hypocrite to say Amen in the house of God living like I've lived but God started dealing with me and my wife bought me a little Walkman I know this younger generation don't know what that kind of stuff is but it actually had a cassette tape in it you know old-fashioned stuff you know oh this will sound bad you guys maybe sister Jerry should have been the pastor but she started she started encouraged me here Paula I already put a sermon in the in your Walkman and fresh batteries listen to it today please this story's a lot uglier new thanks Saints I stand here by God's grace nothing I'd find myself somewhere work and shoveling corrugate changing water and I think okay put that in there turn that on least brother branham you could be a little kinder until one day i've been eating on that word and something stirred and I said Amen who was it said that do you know I can tell you it wasn't me oh I can take you back to quotes if you want it it was Christ in me saying Amen to his word it wasn't this flesh this flesh felt like dirt but it was Christ in me amen because something told me I'm not a vulture I don't care how hard the preacher preaches at me I'm gonna prove the preacher wrong if the preacher says I'm the problem I'm gonna come to church prayed up I'm gonna come to church inspired I'm gonna prove the preacher wrong I'm not the problem or I can run well hallelujah that one might have been hard to swallow you see the word just made manifest the C gene that's in us Amen it had to be God all along Saints it ain't you and I do you get that Amen for this pure word to be born it could not be the seed of our hearts it could not be the inspiration of our mind but it was the seed gene of God in our heart and then it was Godsey G they come down and inspire that and the prophet of God said that brings forth a child Amen that's what brings forth the Living Word hallelujah because if it was me or you in any part of this it would no longer be a pure word it will no longer be unadulterated amen now we'll probably preach on to this so brother Chris brother David you don't touch it amen hallelujah but I'll tell you my brother and sister the Prophet goes and he says look what it is the hybrid seed when anything else is introduced into it it's now a hybrid seed and the hybrid seed will never take you back to the original it can't take you back to the original because something else was introduced and changes the DNA forever oh just study about it now I don't want to be too personal here too much though when a man in a woman gets intimate and have relationship now my brother and sister they're proving that the man changes the DNA of the woman forever oh if that doesn't take it back to the word and stir you all my brother and sister that's why the prophet of God said don't let that denominational spirit get into you or get into your church because it will change the nature and the DNA of your church forever but this is not a place for us to come to hybrid this is a place my brother and sister for the true word to be burst Oh hallelujah Amen what that DNA that see gene in me and you a man will bring court the word according to the word that's all I can do right every seed bring forth of its own kind amen hallelujah hey you want to see God move hey man anybody want to see God move you want to see the supernatural you want to see the miraculous hallelujah you have a real expectation Oh I come to church today expecting you know where two or three are gathered in his name now look that's the scripture I'm not going to speak against it but I'm gonna tell you move on from that you can look around and say well one two three four five six seven twenty twenty-five it's really gonna move is it really come on we've had services here then I was afraid that somebody would call the coroner nay was more than two or three of us here come on it's time in a real expectation hey man how about we come to the place you know what just in case brother Trevor didn't pray up this morning just in case sister Carrie didn't pray up this morning yes in case sister su didn't pray up this morning just in case brother David didn't pray up this morning sister Diane didn't pray up this morning sister Nadia didn't prep this morning I'm gonna break through and get down to the throat how many get almost of a coal of fire from the altar and I'm gonna haul it richer and I'm gonna take it up there and I'm gonna set this place on fire just in case my brother my sister my friends and they're having a hard time and the devils been pounding on them I'm gonna make sure that I bring the double portion to church or we can sit back and say well there'll be two or three of this so Amen God will meet us there oh my doing okay you see it's time for us to quit that foolin around we almost use this scripture sometimes parables of the scripture as a crutch well hallelujah I looked around and I feel beaten and I sing like I'm beaten and I worship like I'm beaten but so does everybody else so I'm doing okay really well hallelujah hopefully there's no laws against Church abuse look it's time to have a real expectation you know the prophet Bob Foster talks about those painted fires come on Saints let's just go let's just get our little painted fire here we'll get three or four of them so there's room enough for all of us to gather around it and we'll all be doing good because we can look at the painted fire house that for us I don't think it works at all does it hallelujah I remember one time many many years ago my wife just really rails on me cuz it seems like I married her and quit hunting I think that she probably was the fault I was hunting with a brother many years ago or wading through the snow my feet had quit hurting hours before they just they were just numb and he's his march along he's all happening wants to climb another mountain and do whatever and I was like what's wrong with you and he said it isn't what's wrong with me it's what's right with me I have battery-powered socks well I tell you what it didn't do me any more good knowing he had battery-powered socks than before my feet were still numb and I wanted to go back to camp and I could care less about this hunting trip I'm gonna get back in the pickup and I'm gonna drive home because whose crazy idea was this to go hunting in December because a deer and the elk will all be right down here well right down here the snow was only this deep painted fire my brother and sister how about we reach out would you would you humor me today how about we just reach out and tear our painted fire into today how we tear it it through and not settle for a painted fire talking about what God did 50 60 70 or 100 years ago let's talk about what God is going to do and is doing right here today but if you said they're just dead oh pardon me I don't mean it to be any salt to anybody but you said they're just dead on the Pew and expect them to rev you up yet you cited well I'll tell you more than likely what will happen is you'll just start critiquing the preacher he repeated that four times he didn't say that right he didn't do this over here my brother and sister you see it's all what our expectation is we talk about expectation the prophet of God talks about expectation let's start coming and exercising expectation hallelujah lujah oh you know what I don't want to burn the church down but I think we ought to get a holy ghost wildfire grace Tabernacle I'll tell you I'm I'm gonna figuratively oh I want to make sure you understand figuratively gonna bring my gallon of gas to church from now on and I'm not gonna go home with my gallon of gas I'm gonna pour it out amen I want to light the fire because I for one saints have just done with cold dead formal I went to church it was good went home didn't change anything got up in the morning felt just exactly like I did last week last month last year and my kids are wondering you know look at mom and dad and they think I need to serve God and I need to get excited and I need to commit my life to the Lord and all I see is this painted fire and I have handled the painted fire I've put it out in the weeds it won't light them on fire I'll put it to me it won't light me on fire this painted fire won't warm me up when I'm sad mad glad whatever it is this painted fire don't mean nothing and my parents want me to buy a painted fire come on Saints come on mother's father's and I say to our children come on children you don't have to settle for a painted fire the real is here God is on the scene hallelujah oh but I'll tell you my brother and sister real expectation must be expressed before the supernatural can be experienced so we sit here and say I have expectation no real real expectation must be expressed before the supernatural can be experienced hallelujah you know another thing that strikes my heart we let the natural hold the supernatural hostage look at this my brother's sister no gun no bomb no knife no weapon we just simply let the natural well went to church but I didn't feel like they got much good keep feeling it you're not gonna see the supernatural because you got not one drop of expectation to see it amen you're letting this body this mind this spirit hold the supernatural hostage o my brother and sister well can I have just another minute or two his mother knew that she had laid two eggs not one there had to be another one somewhere she went to Hut it flying around circling finally she'd come over the barnyard and she found Paul I mean she found her baby and she screamed to him it was a voice that he realized that's the thing that fit who can say him into that hey man I was raised in the church raised on the Pew my brother and sister I walked away but the voice kept calling me and I praise the Lord woke up one day and said this is the only thing that fits hallelujah well thank you lord I like it when things fit amen that's what he was looking for see and he realized then that he wasn't a chicken oh my back to this realization he was an eagle and that's the way every born-again Christian when you come I don't care how many denominations you joined how many names you you put your name on the books and things when the real Word of God is vindicated and main true before you like that you realize you're an eagle NoHo I tell you my brother and sister I got some friends and walked away from this message I'm not speaking down to him I believe the Lord will call them back but they went out and I have these conversations with them that are our heart I mean my brother and sister when somebody says well Paul you owe it I owe it to you Oh take these words I owe it to you to take you guys away from the message you know what my answer to him was what are you doing what are you doing well I can't find a church I like wonder why amen you know what I told him much as I love you buddy I'm not going to join you in your misery it sounds offensive but there's a church down the street here it's got a rainbow I can go down there and be anything I want to be but you see I've already been there not that church but be whatever I want to be that didn't fit I could be like these guys here but that doesn't fit I won't be like these guys but that doesn't fit I could do this but it doesn't fit hallelujah I can't help what he believes what he feels what he calls right or wrong all I know is what fits hallelujah I woke up one day and said this fits hallelujah Amen didn't fit that's what he's looking for she realized that he wasn't a chicken he was an eagle and that's the way every born-again Christian when you come I don't care how many denominations you joined how many names you put your name on the books and things that when that real word of God is vindicated and made true before you like that you realize you're an eagle right there because all this clucking of a hen you join this and join this and go this way and that way it's nonsense it's genuine adding to the word oh my brother and sister let me go back to the Eagle story when that Eagle ever finally gets all of those primary feathers you know he can't fly without them right so we got to get a foundation a spiritual foundation under us because otherwise the wind will slip from beneath your wings and when you get those eagle's wings out there and those primary feathers say man you get your things laid down in brecht foundation what in the prophet of God talks about witnessing those things that Eagle gets that little eagle it to latch on and takes them out there and God is so mean just don't you and let you just but there's not been a one of us that ever hit rock-bottom God come right down and said Here I am and you know I like rabbit I like lamb I like all of this and as long as mama is feeding me this is good but did you know that right after mama teaches baby eaglet to fly she also puts him on a diet come on Saints amen and as he's flying around Mama's like remember that rabbit you liked all this preaching about the third pole in the opening of the seals and all of this how you've got the Holy Ghost and all this there is it for yourself that's so cool no no my brother and sister I'll tell you what it is I'll tell you what happens when someone's never learned now I don't say this I don't say this derogatory at all it's just a simple fact but when someone's never learned how to get in here and find it for themselves well I'm not talking about outside of the message things but you've got to get to the place that you say you know what Matt that carcass that we fed on hey man that was so good I had a gastric Jubilee I shouted and I did it I love that I want more of that how do I get more of that well I guess I'll wait til Wednesday night I guess I'll wait to to Sunday wool my brother and sister you got to learn to feed yourself you gotta learn to feed yourself amen oh I'm not talking about coming up with our own revelation hallelujah but you got to learn to feed yourself because mommy Eagle will come along and she'll point out the rabbit for you and she'll even communicate to you how this is all going to work and what that rabbits behavior is and how what you got to do to feed yourself but she's not going to go day after day for the rest of your life it's time for us to be what the prophet of God said when he said a Christian a real Christian is wrong she's not a hothouse flower she's not some little Lily that you know just waiting for everything to work oh my brother and sister she is rugged Oh hallelujah and when a germ comes in the womb of the female it don't take you didn't become a human germ from your father and then the next thing you become the germ from a dog and the next thing from a cat and the next thing from a chicken it was all human germ and the body of Jesus Christ what does he say the body is the bride amen the body of Jesus Christ the bride amen will be part of his body so she can't go and become a separate entity she's got to be oh I'll tell you what to those people I hope none of them are in this church I hope it's none of you sisters but when we come to the place that we will not submit to the higher authority as it would a wife to her husband and us to Christ we've got issues and we need to settle those issues don't make a big fight over it don't make a big fuss over it go back to the word and say Lord let me sit pattern up this word that's all I want to be I don't have to be a doormat I don't have to be beat around I'm not a slave a man I'm a daughter of God but lord let me understand what it means to submit an S comes down double so for the preacher hallelujah amen gotta learn to submit amen and the body of Jesus Christ the bride will be part of his body which will he was the word and the bride will have to be the word word oh come on I wish to add another book here amen let me borrow a book somebody Amen hallelujah huh oh I really want the Bible thank you hey man so what is he saying here amen the bride will have to be the word amen and the word added to the word added to the word amen and that's how we get built up my brother and sister Luther's justification Wesly sanctification Pentecostals baptism of the Holy Spirit restoration of the gifts all the rest of it goes with it see it's got to be the word on top of the word germ on top of the germ life on top of the life to bring out the full stature of the bride of the Lord Jesus Christ now remember you was an attribute Oh hallelujah not just something snatched out the atmosphere you're an attribute God Himself Oh I'll tell you people struggle with that God Himself just go study it out through the message amen hallelujah what was on God was reconciling himself to the world oh I tell you I just read a quote the other day I showed a saved I can't find it again and that just really bothers me but brother Branham says God come right down there that dead body of Jesus poured life into him come on that body laying there was dead people have well you know it was just God doing his thing no that body was dead God chose to resurrect that body just like we chose to resurrect this body Oh hallelujah hallelujah I've got to hurry along here I'm just having so much fun this is getting ridiculous okay and now the thing of it is after we find out these things that Christ is coming for his bride now how do we get into that bride how do we get in that right that's the question many say join our congregation one of them wants a certain type of baptism one wants to do this or that one said you must speak with tongues or you haven't got another said you don't have to speak with tongues this says you must dance in the spirit this one says you must shout this you've got got a sensation it's alright and then still it's all wrong how could a man or a woman or a child of God that's born of the Spirit of God deny the word of God when God Himself interpret it and say this is it I promised it here it is showing it just as plain as it can be now you know here's the stumbling block Saints some people say I don't see it now we're gonna make sure we don't get an attitude of like oh then then poor sorry people can't see it what you should do is stop and say thank you Lord that you were kind enough to me and then I could see it not Allu you because people say well well Paul I don't agree with you show me the message you know I didn't even bother I'm sorry this might sound bad I didn't even bother to respond because all they had to do is take the very words they were arguing over put it right into a message search and they would come up with all kinds of places and ways that the prophet of God spoke about it and clarified it I'm sorry I'm sorry those that hunger and thirst you know I'm a terrible cook but I'm a survivalist in other words that means I can eat my own cooking and live through it and you know there's times I've been known to call sister Jerry and say honey when you're gonna be home and she's like well I've still got to go to the bank and I've still got to go do this errand you wanted me to do and I kind of get those parts it's gonna be 2 or 3 hours and I don't want to cook so bad I'll go hungry for three hours till she shows up no that's normal don't look down on me that's normal amen because you see I'm not in survival mode survival mode is when she used to go visit her family in Alaska and was gone for two weeks and then it was like whoa honey would you have her supper tonight uh hamburger next day honey what job for supper tonight a hamburger honey what'd you have for supper tonight a hamburger honey when are you gonna quit eating hamburger well it's almost gone but I'm falling some more well you know you can't ruin a hamburger right look Saints this is it showing just as plain as it can be why they're bound to see it see how could Christ deny his own Word and if Christ is in you it can't deny his own words then how do we get into this body first Corinthians twelve by one spirit were all baptized into this body by one Holy Spirit baptism then if you want to put that down first Corinthians 12:13 by one spirit we're all baptized and the Spirit is the life of Christ is that right the congregation said amen amen congregation said amen the life of Christ and the life of any seed which he was the word seed brings the seed to life you get it and if life is laying in the seed and this baptism of the Holy Spirit comes upon it it's bound bring that seed life hallelujah we don't have a complicated formula we don't got a big thing we got a toe the mark to my brother and sister people say well you know you gotta this and for this and the Prophet said this the Prophet said this hallelujah we can go take all the other ones and do whatever you want to do but the Prophet said this my brother and sister and I'm telling you the seed of the bride is in the bride and the groom which is our Lord Jesus Christ is the one who Germa ties that seed and is bringing forth the body bride of Jesus Christ hallelujah hallelujah oh I'll tell you why I know I'm going for PO to code I'm sorry I don't normally preach this way but lately I just can't help myself looking now in the rising of the Sun if you haven't listened this sermon for a while I'd recommend you go home listen to this hey man it is so good I just cannot get over it amen it's just so many things you listen to it and some more pops right out of it now the very essence of the mess that was sent that he is risen from the dead we his beneficiaries we who share the resurrection with him draw benefits from this by proving to the world that he is alive now who's proving to the world that he is alive Christ in you there is the proof that he's alive because we were dead and we have been resurrected and it was not some done in the dark thing God's drugged the drunks he's drugged the prostitutes he's drugged the whatever's and proved to the world he can change his people hallelujah Amen okay where am I Who am I what am I doing here I'm afraid today that too many of us are not getting people to Christ we're getting them to a church to a theory but we must get them to Christ amen that's the only solution Saints Church is good we're here today I get a talk you listen wonderful really is that all we're doing here no I hope not I trust not you see what we're doing my brother and sister is we are getting to the place that Christ is no longer just in his church as a building but he's in his church hallelujah yeah must get them to Christ he is the only one and the only one that has life he that has the son has life and if the life of a man that's dead be projected in you meaning Christ you will live the same life he lived if the blood of a man was a certain type and you took the blood from one man and changed the blood of one man into another he would absolutely be that type blood in other words that the bloods there you can't argue with the type amen hallelujah now look and that gospel light of the resurrection the confirmation of the word how did we know he was the Christ because he proved what he was talking about how will I know the message of the hour God proves what he promised and he talks about it and that is the identification that we are beneficiaries with him in the resurrection he proves what he was he and what he has talked about now I want to interject this in again this is my personal view of it this is my personal take of it no one has to agree with me but my brother and my sister I'll tell you what I believe with all of my heart all of the vindications of who brother Branham was as a prophet the hand the discernment all of the signs all of these gifts that was given the opening of the word and we say that was brother branham's vindication that's good I agree with it my brother and sister every bit of it fits perfectly with the scripture but I tell you now don't stumble over this but I tell you my brother and sister to brother Paul the vindication of brother Branham his ministry he talked about it he said this is what the word will produce this is what the life will do and this will be and you can talk about all that and say well you know there's right on the tapes you know names that were called people have went even in latter times here you know back years these people it's the way now but they went to him and said you know you was in a prayer line your name was called was this and people talk about yes I was there I was healed this and this happened all this experience and did you know there was a message and I'm not really interested well okay okay that's good but my brother and sister I'll tell you what's vindication to me vindication to me was the very thing that the word said he said the word will produce it I've come to put this in the order I've come to do this and if you get the word you get the Holy Ghost you get the line you this is what it will produce and here it is and here it is what he talked about is coming to pass it's right here he didn't just kind of hid it here and kind of hid it here paper like well we're william branham and the problem is here well you're looking way too far behind because the word was spoken and it went forth as a seed and it come into a bedding ground and some people one day a walking on a street walking into a mission coming into a service into a tent hearing the preaching of the word and something German ties in them and I tell you what happened they didn't walk out in five years later go I think something happened they walk out and go I don't know what happened but something happened oh I don't want to be crass today but they got intimate with Jesus Christ and a seed was put into them and it's not them and it's not their seed it was Christ the seed and the Dermott eyes life was Christ and it will bring forth hallelujah it will bring forth a virgin book Word of God not manhandled not man interpreted not man twisted Oh hallelujah Oh what he promised to do in Christ he proved on the resurrection what he promised to do in the days of Moses he proves he proved what he promised in the days of Enoch he proved in all the days of the Apostles he proved it now in this day Oh hallelujah we're not talking another day I'm reading this quote today whatever the date is may something 2020 my brother and sister now in this day he proves what he said because they are a part of that seed that was represented on the book of life that he come to redeem back to God oh what a message what a message amen we don't got a message oh come do this put your name on the book come here come here donate time this that's in the other we put you on a plaque on the wall forget it we got a message Alleluia oh my goodness amen now look where am I once again Who am I hey man I need I need to go backwards brothers Ryan I need to go back here where are we I've got to find this I've lost got lost I read that coming down here before 66 oh right here Thanks right in front of my face well that's the way it is for a lot of people we cannot do it by some tradition of men we only reflect exactly what we are pointing to come on church are you with me you want to reflect Christ you got to be pointed to him you reflect the church you're pointed to church you reflect the preacher you're pointed at the preacher you reflect as it were message overall you're pointed to a religious activity because you see this message the prophet of God said will never become a nomination never if we have a denominational tendency then that means we're looking to a denomination but you look to Christ and you're gonna have Christ tendencies you're gonna have a word hallelujah the word coming to life in you Oh hallelujah Oh hallelujah my oh my how do you one more call oh I get all over brother David then I turn around and do the same thing amen well I have to say when it comes to brothers and little brothers they saved the best for last and we find today that the modern church modern church world the modern world Church is also that the spiritual church are both pregnant to give birth to son so we got we got two churches both pregnant you're gonna give birth to sons one of them a denominational birth is going to give one of a day these days at the World Council of Churches which will produce the world to the world the Antichrist through a denomination that's exactly the truth I may not live to see it I believe I will now look my brother and sister this always I'm just going to throw this in here so I if I throw any bricks out you stumble over them no don't worry about it it's intended to I may not live to see it I believe I will okay let's weigh this out on one hand God didn't promise that brother branham had to see it a lot of things god never promised brother Branham had to be here okay are we good with that so he said he believed he would see it What did he say I believe that the ending or closing down of this Gentile dispensation take place in 1977 people fell off the cliff right and left he prophesied that's all it can be you read the words it's a prophecy and it didn't happen okay brother Brown says well I didn't prophesy I'm just chewing this but let's get on the other side the scale are you with me maybe something happened that fulfilled that and we don't have a clue but if I didn't see it I can't believe it well we got scripture for that yeah and at this really good conversation with the brother one time he looked me in the face caught me totally off-guard and he said brother Paul you made this little statement then he looked me right in the eye and said I am now the devil's advocate man he looked at me with such intensity I was like oh no 1977 he said prove to me something happened I said I can't all I can do is take a profits words that he believes something would happen 1977 and then you know how the Lord will give you inspiration I started speaking to him well brother Brian said this and this led to this and this came here and halfway through the conversation it caught me off guard proved to me something didn't happen I was like wait you can't switch sides he said I can do anything I want but you see Saints regardless of whether something happened or something didn't happen that doesn't make the Word of God change in one iota if that's what we pinned our belief in the message on something so small then we're in serious trouble your garbage chute is not going to work at 500 feet and several thousands per square inch of pressure hallelujah the garbage will back up sink your boat are you with me Alleluia you see this isn't what we're looking at we're looking at a sure Word of God amen that's exactly true so I'm a lot lived I believe I will but you young people that was me remember that you heard a minister say that it'll finally wind up and that is the mark of the beast when she forms that World Council of Churches she'll give birth to her son the Antichrist the other now we're getting down to us amen we're getting down to our subject the other is pregnant by the word of God and will bring forth the body the finished body of Jesus Christ which is the bride hallelujah the body of Christ isn't finished yet how many knows that a man and a woman is one and Christ is one body the word the bride will have to be the rest of that body whoa my brother and sister I'll tell you what it'll be hoops and the natural become one with our husbands and lives a meant natural and spiritual types hallelujah but look at this see how many knows that a man and a woman is one Christ is one body no word the bride will have to be the rest of that body and the two together makes the one body again like Adam was at the beginning man his wife are one now she the true bride so sold out hallelujah Oh lock stock and barrel hallelujah that she used no mind of her own his mind of course is his will and his will is his word what sister had me come I gotta stop what's producing a brine this right here my brother and sister this is what is producing a bride now you want to know where the carcass is worse the carcass right here hallelujah so we eat this now look my brother and sister if we are half it is what he said right oh my we have to be our portion the two together makes one body again you realize where we're at Saints I'm stepping I'm stepping into my position in best I mean called I'm being coaxed I got so hungry for the word I was using rabbit earlier is it I'm so hungry for the word I've got to go find some more word not a new word just more word what a yesterday it's not good enough that was yesterday and I'm already looking forward to the word I'll eat tomorrow hallelujah Maura I'm already looking sister Jerry always says Paul what about your husband this that and the other is like now

I'll tell you what strikes my heart as much as anything today Amen is those faithful men of the gospel who through every trial every test every struggle they got discouraged just like you they had health problems just like you Amen their arguments whether you know Paul had eye problem pasal Paul had I problems and he had bad problems and he talks about these things and he puts it in the context lest these infirmities aim unless I would be lifted up God allowed this to come upon me now if we would just stop and say thank you Lord because obviously lord if I've got an infirmity you had to let it happen amen but to look at those Saints of old now I want to bring this home my brother and sister every age every generation those that gave their life they didn't have to die they didn't have to die to give their life that wasn't the key that they died they fawned that's the real key they fought they didn't roll over and die they fought now I want you to think about this right before we close
