brother rohr sister mona the boys god bless you brother jose sister sephie and the boys god bless you today pray the lord just just touch your hearts today you know as we look at this time coming up on a holiday commemorating the birth of a nation people say this is what we did to make america but you see god placed america in revelation before man ever had the idea of a nation amen and in that nation that god birthed in revelation 13 he placed you and i in that nation put us here today for a reason for a purpose not just to celebrate you might say freedom but to celebrate a freedom that goes beyond anything man ever thought of i'm thankful for this sacrifice that's been made through the ages to allow you and i to have the freedom we have today but i just want to make this point this is my real point here the only real freedom we have today is in jesus christ [Music] while we celebrate all the years of what we call america i'm happy to say sons and daughters of god through the ages have been able to celebrate the freedom it is the true freedom it is not a freedom in name only it's not a freedom as a mirage but a freedom that behind an iron curtain there was freedom behind communist china there was freedom in the jungles of africa and south america there was freedom and in the most you might say refined in one sense nation on earth we have it the easiest i believe of any nation and yet we see the downfall of many a person but god has given us liberty in this place in this house of god today we have liberty not because of what was done in 1776 but because of what was done on calvary and even more current you might say of what he's done in our life this morning hallelujah because you can look back at yesterday and say oh praise the lord i was prayed up i was on fire for god but that ought to be your testimony this morning that god is here god is present my god is powerful and he's breaking every fetter amen there's not a single fetter in your life that you look to this morning and say but this is what's holding me back let god break it in fact i declare to you god has already broken it amen it's just time for you and i to recognize this fetter this chain is already i was just reading so beautiful i was reading the prophet of god says now you have to look at this don't look at this as future tense you need to look at the word when he said you're healed he's not looking at the future it's looking at the past hands the only time probably a believer ought to look back it's already done it's already finished i'm already delivered from the yoke i've already been set free in christ jesus and i've already rose up into heavenly places claiming my rightful position in jesus christ oh hallelujah hallelujah you know what's really exciting you can find this in the message i encourage you to go read it there's just a handful of quotes you know what the real thrill in my life is see the birth of the bride amen the prophet of god put it this way it says it was there in word form yes sir hallelujah i'm glad let let me be born amen that i've become a perfect reflection of jesus christ hallelujah hallelujah i want to speak to you this morning on our position of strength once again and i want to speak with the title of it is written thank you so much and sister heidi i'm so happy to see you in your proper position amen hallelujah isn't this beautiful vika smile big because you're next on the list hallelujah and then we'll move right on down in fact let me just put it this way i don't care who you are or what you think about yourself this morning if god has placed a gift in you you need to break that bondage that has it i i can't do that i couldn't get up in public i couldn't say this i couldn't play i might make a mistake come on young people god's given you a talent exercise it for the glory of god not that people would look at you hallelujah that was a pretty dead response but i'll claim it anyhow amen hallelujah now it is written is often associated with the temptation that jesus had in the wilderness and as he come out of the wilderness i should say and satan was there to tempt him and uh our lord jesus response was it is written it is written that is often how we relate to the words it is written we think okay here was a time and it's written and i stand on that but i want to take a little different look at it as written this morning and i pray that this would be a blessing to your heart as we turn in our bibles to revelations 1 and starting with the first verse amen we just want to to be mindful because i'm telling you saints i am sorry but i have the king's buffet this morning hallelujah we didn't go over to the china wall we didn't go over here to this place or that place to partake in the buffet we came to the king's buffet this morning and i'm telling you the king's buffet is so big amen it's got everything you need right now those of you who eat green things it's there to those of you brother roar that are meat and potatoes it is there and those of you that like to indulge in dessert it is there and the thing is god's given you an appetite i don't know why i think about it this way but you know whenever your body changes and your body goes into ketosis and all of a sudden your body says you you don't need all this extra stuff here and your body starts to change and your metabolism kicks in and you uh you you start you know eating more and people are saying you eat so much how can you be so skinny well i'm telling you i don't know something happened and i i i'm not getting fat on laodicea because i've got a different diet now and that diet is promoting me to be hungry and that's why when i come to the house of god i'm hungry when i get up in the morning i'm hungry and when i go to bed at night i'm hungry because something's happening in me i couldn't make it happen but it did oh can someone say thank you lord thank you lord just pour the food out on us lord amen revelations 1 1-6 the revelation of jesus christ singular right which god gave into him to show unto his servants things which must shortly come to pass and he sent and signified it by his angel and to his servant john now some people i've heard read this first verse kind of confusing because you see the the revelation of jesus christ which god gave unto him to show so they then start thinking these are john's servants no no these are not john's servants john is a servant amen amen amen who bear record of the word of god and of testimony of jesus christ amen and of all things that he saw firsthand account right not second-hand account these are the things that he saw blessed is he that readeth and they that hear the words of this prophecy now i want to take just a couple moments sorry keep you standing but see the whole book of revelation is prophecy now the proper interpretation is the book of the apocalypse but you see for you and i it's not an apocalypse if the lord would be gracious i wouldn't want to speak out of turn but this is the book of joy unspeakable and full of glory amen we preached last week the judgment begins in the house of god and when that judgment is complete saints it leaves you and i not with a tarnish or a scuff but it leaves you and i polished clean holy righteous beautiful in the eyes of god this is our jubilee amen hallelujah let's live in jubilee today saints don't be looking for a jubilee somewhere down the road live in jubilee today because you've been called by almighty god hallelujah blessed is he that readeth and they that hear the words of this prophecy and keep those things which are written therein for the time is at hand hallelujah now look at this my brother and sister as we look at this now i just hope that we can catch this john to the seven churches which are in asia grace be unto you and peace from him which is which was and which is to come jesus christ the same yesterday today and forever and from the seven spirits which are before his throne and from jesus christ who is the faithful witness and the first begotten of the dead and the prince of the kings of the earth unto him that loved us and washed us from our sins in his own blood you see judgment beginning in the house of god is you stopping long enough if you don't mind me putting it this way you stopping long enough to say lord wash not only my hands and my head wash behind my ears scrub my elbows my hinder most parts you know what that is that's the part we hide scrub me and lord i'll stand here amen and i'll bear the scrubbing amen i'll bear the cleansing i'll bear it amen amen because i want to be dead to everything but you lord amen therefore i will endure whatever chastisement correction i will bear it all lord for you amen because he washed us from our sin in his own blood and path i love this verse let's really focus on it because it's going to be a little portion of our foundation today now all that god has done my brother and sister he could wash us in his blood and he could have calvary and all of these things but he didn't have to do a single thing with you at that point you realize that god had no obligation to do one thing other than to say i'm gonna i'm gonna save you i'm going to come down i'm going to save you but look what god chose to do look at the beauty of verse 6 and half made us that's us can someone say amen that's us kings and priests unto god and his father to him be glory and dominion forever and ever amen heavenly father bless the word today i pray in your name amen you may be seated saints you know it was a kind of a remarkable thing for me saints i went to bed last night and just the way i study and stuff and i had some thoughts down i had scripture down as we've just read and got up this morning and and felt like i had just walked into a wall and it's like okay stop i cannot struggle through this because i realize i just simply can't when the mind is blank then there's just not anything you can do you could pick up a thousand books you could do everything try to stimulate your mind but then what brings us to a place you stop and say well lord okay maybe my thoughts are what i was going to express lord let me you see we have to come to that place we say lord let me express what it is you want expressed and when you come into that position then the doors open and things just pour out and you realize the notes that you had in scriptures you had are all the same notes in scripture but a different thought a different uh avenue that god takes you down and and uh so as i was reading this this morning once again you know uh i i just realized how that god can allow us as in our studies and our thoughts to to start down the path but a decision of right or left or uh straight ahead or whatever it is not really our decision if we need to leave it as god's decision and that's why as young people we don't want to just plow ahead stubbornly in our own thoughts and ideas but we want to stop because you see while god you know i preached this in south america at a camp meeting and there was in a building there is actually a school and it was kind of interesting how that uh the lord just allowed this thought to come and maybe i'll just express it for a moment if you guys got an extra five minutes to spare and you know so it's here it is god trying to bring us to this place right here but you know when we make the wrong decisions when we make uh uh ideologies out of things and we're gonna go our own direction and we decide you know i don't really want to go the way that you know it seems as this is the church this is the message this is what they want me to do i i'm going to reject that i think what i'm going to do is i'm just going to go do my own thing and so here i am moving through life moving through my own situation and i i'm thinking i'm making my own decisions and i i think that i'm just doing what it is you know that i want to do and that's the best thing for me and i'm in and out of situations i'm in and out of the days and the ages and the places and the friendships and we see how that god would then allow us to come and we think that we're still in our own path doing our own thing and we would come and find my brother and sister that we are moving along and the years are going by isn't that scary it's july yesterday it was january and we're moving and we're thinking i'm doing my own thing and i'm just you know it's it's life is tough i don't care who you meet i don't care where you go there will be rich people my brother and sister that are depressed and have anxieties they have sicknesses they have struggles and they have all of that but a son or daughter of god one day and because this isn't quite as expansive of a building is that when one day you wake up and you say i just got to serve god and you realize you're at the point that god called you to in the very beginning but god rich in mercy god rich and mercy said they thought you were lost over there they thought it was done for you here and they thought they would take you away there but god rich in mercy brings you right back to that point and then you'll be like paul and look back and say i wish to god i had not wasted 21 years of my life but i can stand today not with tears or remorse but with tears of praise and say thank you lord while it looked like in those 21 years it wouldn't work but you brought me back you put me back on the rock again and it's you and you alone amen it that's right oh hallelujah look i hope you don't mind this morning but i'm going to be boastful i am a king i am a priest in the kingdom of my god i'm not just some weary pilgrim wandering through a dark and dreary pilgrim that's almost ready every single day to give up on my christianity i'm a son of god hallelujah oh now you look at this and have made us kings and priests unto god and his father to him be glory opinion forever and ever look at this when i i thought it was so interesting as i was reading this last night just reading again through it trying to find an inspiration not realizing what the lord would desire but you see someone my brother and sister someone has been exalted amen the word is never empty the word has not just got words to fill it up they didn't need to you know publishers today if a book is too few pages nobody wants to buy it because there's no content if it's too many pages people won't buy it because they're like i'll never get through that book the bible wasn't just filled up full of stories and words so that it'd be just the right size every word has value amen thank you lord for the word thank you lord for the word and he hath made us kings and priests so my point here is when i read that something spoke to me and said someone was exalted amen someone has been lifted up from a position that they were in previously a position that was in a lower state can someone say thank you lord i have been delivered from my lower state i've been raised up to another place called heavenly places i've been elevated i've been exalted oh you're a boastful you're a boastful man you make mistakes too that's right but it wasn't me that elevated me it was god that elevated you amen because if it was us we will fall off that podium or off of that pedestal but when god puts you up in the heavenly places god says i have the answer for you i put you there and i will keep you oh i there you too many christians live in fear they're going to fall off the pedestal the devil's going to knock me off and then oh all my years will be wasted you trust god and the devil can't knock you off of that pedestal he will try oh yes he'll try and you might think you're a failure but why don't you stop long enough to consult your god and ask him what he thinks we consult the devil all the time but you know what the problem is the devil just gives free advice and god expects something out of you for his advice and look at the world we live in have you ever noticed that just recently we were looking at a little document or whatever and i thought well i don't know maybe there's something online so i typed in the little query into the search thing and you know the the page i don't know i think there's like i don't know how many just page after page free legal documents all you have to do is give us your credit card number so that we can verify your human your address and your social security number and your bank account number and but it's free isn't that the way the devil works all you got to do is just well just go ahead and just i'm not going to charge you nothing today but at the end of it all fine print if you use this site 25 times we have the right to charge your credit card 98 dollars sounds free to me and that's exactly where the devil's at you can live frolic run jump holler all this time but there comes a day he says oh you didn't read the fine print the fine print says when you come to me for my consultation i'll let you go for a while but after a while i have to charge you it's actually just to cover the overhead because you see pitchforks and flaming whatever anyway we'll skip out they cost a lot but someone my brother and sister has got to be exalted wonder who that's going to be is this going to take place in the future or is it already finished he's already provided amen oh lord would you come on this sea no what he's wanting to you is to stand up and say lord you promised it i'm not going to be arrogant i'm not going to come the prophet of god talking about he was somewhere at a place and there was somebody there praying they had a prayer line and the guy is screaming to the top of his lungs as though he's casting the devil out by screaming another one they grab an old man and they're almost beating on him to get this spirit out of him the prophet of god said none of that works it is that personal relationship with jesus christ that allows you to speak with authority and in that authority you're able then to stand with quiet confidence and here i am telling you that while i yell at you what a paradox but the yelling isn't what i do the yelling is the excitement bubbling up inside of me amen kind of like run away the bottle just explodes that's christ in you the hope of glory they can't bottle it up they can't keep it under control it is in you and it must come out it will come out because you can't stifle the life oh the devil would like to and old cold dead formal churches would like to but i'm telling you the holy ghost in you cannot be contained it will come out and it's powerful hallelujah now look at this what is happening here in this exalting my brother and sister god doesn't care about the carnal there's a whole realm in the world that's like well if you have the holy ghost or if you really feel that if you're fulfilling the word of god god wants to give you a big house god wants to give you a swimming pool with your big house god wants to give you a seven car garage with that big house and swimming pool but none of that's any good if you can't buy a maserati so god's going to give you lots of cash to burn and this is a sign that god loves you look how many people it snared look how many and it snared some right within what we call the message but what did the prophet say the evidence of the holy ghost there's a lot of different things some people say it's speaking in tongues some say it was oil in the hand blood in the hand blood in the forehead got all kinds of things but i love how the prophet of god brought it down and he put it so simple simple our our children can grasp this and he said the evidence of the holy ghost this is the version i like okay because there's several quotes and you can kind of take it however you want but this is the one i like he said it is believing and acting hearing believing and acting on it not just i heard it and i believed it and someday i'll do something with it hallelujah hearing we're going to have an emphasis here in just a few minutes hearing believing so it went from here into here and when it was in here it came back out here not like those that sounds critical but i'm just stating the facts not like those who you would never guess they were a christian until they told you they were yeah god help us we've all probably had that moment but it's not that we are boasting oh if there's one to boast it's only upon the lord but it is there that these are the evidences of life that have to come out it has to be manifested out because we can say we're a christian but if there is no outward manifestation then we would have to wonder how deep the revelation of what a christian is okay so god's not concerned about the carnal side my brother and sister but what god is wanting to deal with is in the spiritual realm as it comes down that he starts to exalt us now you say well what do you mean by exalt there's a lot of christians on the face of the earth yes there is and i'm not here to judge them not my job i don't even want to sign up for that job imagine going through the paperwork of trying to judge all the people whether they're christian or not you'd run up the rest of your life and only touch a fragment of society not our job but i'm telling you what happens my brother and sister is you come into that place and the spiritual life which is the very life of jesus christ starts to change you and you become such an oddball amen you become such an oddball you become as it were the fanatic you become that strange one aren't we all christians look my brother and sister go right down there at bail pior and they were all there aren't we all one and this is the scary part some said yeah yeah we are just all one well i'll tell you how the prophet of god says if we're looking for unity let's find unity in the word not in how beautiful we sing or how big our churches are or what kind of programs we have let's find unity in the word there's the real unity because otherwise i'll just put it real simple otherwise some will say well if you have drums in your church brother trevor and i've had this conversation a lot of times nothing wrong with the drums nothing wrong with it at all others say if you have them there's something wrong with you others say we use them as it were as a a part of the worship well good reminds me i'll just make this announcement right now ask my dear wife to make a note that i don't forget i have all of you that is musically inclined in this church i have a book i'd like you to read because it shows how the spirit in music will bring the presence of god isn't that beautiful david playing there for saul brought peace to it comfort to it but music please forgive me i uh i get in trouble over these things and i don't want to be in trouble but i'll tell you what there's songs out there i just happened to be in a store the other day and one was playing and i absolutely will not mention that song but you know it was talking about give me a certain music and set my spirit free no i'm sorry that is not freedom my brother and sister the spirit associated with that is a bondage and yet it's shocking how many people are still in the message under that influence oh trust me i've heard jesus loves me sing to rock and roll i've heard amazing grace saying to rock and roll old rugged cross to rock and roll that's a lying devil that's a lying devil let me just throw this out when i do this sometimes as the scripture talks about a wolf in sheep's clothing do you realize my brother and sister the way the scripture lays out they come in to tear up the flock if they're coming in to tear up the flock you see a wolf coming you're going to guard against that wolf but what if the wolf's already in the flock what if the wolf sat there for years nobody notices that the fangs have been sunk into this one and into this one and into that one they don't recognize it until their child turns 18 and splits and they say when did this happen where did this happen it was the wolf the wolf had already taken his bite caused the blood poisoning oh this is a whole different subject but god help us the whole different subject my brother and sister but the poisoning of the blood is in the scripture because it makes the redemption and the crucifixion of jesus christ the scripture says to none effect what did it do it poisoned the blood the blood's no longer valid the blood's no longer sufficient the blood's no longer good we doubt that there is even a god what did they do they poisoned the blood how can that happen because it wasn't the true blood it was the blood of church it was a blood of organization it was the blood of religious spirits now let me get going here promise me that none of you left something in the frying pan now in the church age book this is uh as you see there the way it is in the book the consummation of the gentile ages now look at this this age is the last of the seven church ages what began in the first or ephesian age must and will come to full fruition and harvest in the last laodicean age amen this is revelation one two three so must come to fulfill fruition and harvest in the last or later the scene age the two vines will yield their final fruit the two spirits will terminate their manifestation in each of their final destinations you know people struggle with this you know they're like well you know they want to make hell eternal if hell's eternal then they got eternal life and there's only one place there's eternal life and that's in jesus christ oh well let's argue the verbiage no let's look for the life we can argue all the verbage we want but that won't change anything there is two separate destinations the sowing the watering and the growing is all over summer is ended don we're going to take this literal saints we still got to we got a little while the sickle is now thrust into the harvest in verses 15 to 18 which you've studied lies the true picture of the ripened false vine full spirit false church people i know that works now this is just the bible saints let's just keep it right real simple here i know thy works that thou art neither cold nor hot i would thou worked cold or hot so then because thou art lukewarm and neither cold nor hot i will spew thee out of my mouth and that is shocking to me and has been my whole life from just a child to realize god would rather want me cold how can that be because at least at cold you've stated a clear position and hot stated a clear position but lukewarm lukewarm oh my goodness nobody knows what you are nobody knows where you're going or where you stand or what kind of fruit you will produce they don't have a clue sing in the choir and live like a devil come on the average if you follow me the average is lukewarm but god said i want you cold or i want you hot oh i think i'll just choose hot heart is way simpler i don't have to struggle with where i stand and who i am and why i was placed on this earth i'll just make the position when god called me he called me hot hallelujah hallelujah because thou art lukewarm and neither cold nor hot i'll spew thee out of my mouth now because thou saith i am rich now see there's a continuation of the spirit of the age do you know we're building millionaires around the world at a record pace but it's not just rich financially the scripture here is taking them in a position where they will tell you i've had the holy ghost for this many years and god has blessed me for this many years in this fashion how dare you question my spirituality how dare you preach that i could be lost how dare you assume what is it they're rich in their tradition unless you all get too comfortable and happy with me today i don't want you all leave happy we've got quite a few traditions our own selves and get more all the time wow are we doing okay okay now look at this i'm rich and i'm increased with goods bigger church than we've ever had you know i like how brother branham said he said you know maybe when it comes down to the point that the mayor starts to attend your church you better look real close when you become popular in your community you better look real close you know i'm sorry just bad sense of humor but you know i maybe i shouldn't have thrown that church building seminar thing away you know because they guaranteed it if after 18 months your church hadn't doubled in size and it was only three easy payments of 6.95 is that what church is about it's about coming to the banqueting table amen and everything that's there is for your benefit everything there is for strengthening you everything there is to draw you closer to christ no free for all you know what that term means don't you no frills well we let brother so-and-so sing because he has a perfect voice well that would work good if he has perfect voice and the holy ghost but just having a perfect voice is not going to qualify him or it shouldn't anyway see now our wretched miserable poor blind naked this is why i won't even quote the numbers i don't remember it but this is why a huge percentage of confessed christians in america are also drunks i counsel thee to buy of me gold tried in the fire that thou mayest be rich white raiment that thou mayest be clothed and that the shame of thy nakedness do not appear this is a whole another topic saints i was preaching it to sister jerry the other day talking about these things how it comes down my brother and sister you look at that and go all the way back to the garden and you'll see how that is planned but you look at that and it come down and satan says i have carried that all the way down and it's there constantly exposing us exposing this but then one day you i mean me come underneath the blood of jesus christ and while satan was still viewing us from the point of view they're naked they're naked they're naked the blood of jesus christ come down and closed you and i and we are there realizing i still have sins in my life saints there's times oh i tell you i don't even want to go there but there's times i just have to resist the urge to just slap people silly and if there wasn't gravity i'd slap him right off the face of the earth and it's an urge i have to fight jerry's like i don't think you should say that paul okay well i just want to choke him for a minute or two then and i'm not proud of that but you see i'm under that blood you're under that blood and satan still sees you naked are you with me satan sees you naked god sees you clothed in the blood and satan's looking it from one perspective god's looking it from another perspective and it's all about whose perspective we believe if we believe the devil then we're naked if we believe god we're clothed under the blood of jesus christ that's why the devil is going to recount a lot of things and say you did this and you did that but boy i'll tell you what my brother and sister he'll come up face the lord one day and the lord will say i don't know what you're talking about i say the shame of thy nakedness do not appear and anoint thy eyes will i sound that thou mayest see no words ever spelled out a more bitter denunciation and no uh and no proud and arrogant religious people ever deserved it more see look what's happening here they're naked they have no covering of the blood they make confession but the blood washes away sin it doesn't oh see this is where some people have a misconception oh all my sins are covered by the blood intellectual i can do it and it's just covered but the blood of jesus christ washes away desire washes away all of the things that go with that so that there is no more sin no more conscious of sin see so they receive a bitter denunciation and no proud and arrogant religious people ever deserved it more but here comes a very quick beautiful all of that big long drawn out but look how beautiful this is yet yet is kind of like butt right you get to a certain point and then it's like this seems to be the end of it all yet there's a little more yeah yeah to him that's to him that overcometh will i grant to sit with me in my throne oh saints this was a reinforcement to me you talk about being exalted to him that overcometh i can't overcome you can't overcome but christ in us is the overcomer and he said i'm going to pour myself into you that you will be an overcomer so that i can exalt you and put you up here in my throne oh you talk about i i don't know this might not come out right talk about self-serving god says i need some people i'm going to have some people not i need i'm going to have some people that are going to sit with me in my throne and i'm going to set the stage that they are overcomers so i can put them in the throne even as i also overcome and then sit down with my father and his throne we find the true vine true spirit true church people exalted to the very throne of god with the highest compliment ever paid to a humble steadfast spiritual group oh i tell you what my brother and sister i hope you don't miss it tonight today amen look what god's done god has come down and he has placed you in a position and then complimented you for being in that position he's made the way before you and then complimented you for walking in it and then he has placed you in heavenly places and then complimented you for overcoming oh i love serving a god like that amen not a proud arrogant church not not a proud we are so good we're so spiritual i am a failure without him that's right oh hallelujah amen so look what we're gonna do we're gonna choose between being denounced or complemented but look how the devil spins this the devil is the greatest flatterer on the face of the earth remember he told eve right now remember this because it's important it's important how you approach god with eve he removed lord supreme authority removed lord out of surely thou shall not die bam he falls everything goes into chaos study it in genesis it's a beautiful beautiful deal because you see an impersonal god is a god who won't judge us take it right back to scripture you'll find it an impersonal god won't judge you a personal god will and the minute they fall look in scripture comes right back the lord god amen what was happening this is what i thought i was preaching this morning i'll give you a brief glimpse of this what's happening my brother and sister is satan trying to bring the people which includes us into a position that the record and we'll touch on this a little bit but just a different fashion the record that god is keeping amen god is his word god keeps records so here it is satan keeping records and satan intended to come before god one day and present his record and for god to be able to say i can't deny this i can't deny this what was he doing he was meeting out judgment but the scripture says whatever you meet out will be meted to you and well that goes in another avenue that we won't go today because the devil will receive the judgment he was trying to meet out on the bride of christ he will receive the judgment he was trying to force out on humanity and so he's keeping this record and so it's there that he's doing but god comes along through these words and says you know what i've got a compliment for those who have revelation of the word i've got a compliment for them something to encourage them something to encourage them a compliment to to get them to move on and to be able to keep pressing into the battle and so as they're there they realize you know what this might sound strange to you i've already got my spot picked out before the throne might sound weird i'm not trying to preach a doctrine don't get nervous back there and the reason i say that is because i believe god's given me vision so strongly i'm going to be there i'm i'm going to be there not like the people who said i got into the super bowl for only 150 dollars wow the sad thing was is my binoculars were not strong enough to see the playing field no i'm going to be there that's right not somewhere in the universe i'm going to be there why it's it's in my heart it's in my soul it's it what it's what guides me and leads me because i am going to be one of those that is the overcomer and i've been given a promise of the word to sit down with him in his throne now if i'm at the back of the colosseum my brother and sister i'm not actually sitting down with him now you say how does that come about i don't know and i don't care i just believe the word i get to sit down with him in heavenly places oh are we doing okay okay now as we look at this i want to just be a reminder to you look at what is written get off of your mind what i thought what i was taught what i my emotions says get off of all this stuff well growing up in the church we were taught differently well how about we forget what we were taught and look to what's written let that be our guide because if we're looking to an interpretation my brother and sister this gets scary this gets scary ephesians first chapter blessed be the god and father of our lord jesus christ who hath passed tense did somebody hear me amen so look don't be thinking you're going to look for this it's already here you just need to say lord i receive it i receive this he hath blessed us okay who's blessed amen every hand ought to go up in this building with all carnal blessings no sir you might be poverty-stricken your whole life and be a son and daughter of god and rejoice on the streets of glory on the hills of glory amen all spiritual blessings now did you notice what the scripture says all was really except for the seals come on saints now you might think i'm being brash and bold about this and i'm not it makes a difference it makes a difference when one comes in and starts to say all of the word of god is for you except for that's a wolf because you realize if the seventh seal is not open then you don't know christ ouch i heard somebody's pain why because the prophet of god clearly shows us that is christ so if he's hidden from us then what are we looking at that's right what do we see amen that's right he has chosen us in him before the foundation of the world that we should be holding without blame before him in love i'm i'm liking this having predestinated us in other words foreknown us into the adoption of children by jesus christ to the whole family of god see here's a real technicality he would adopt you into the family of god who can deny that i'm part of the family of god but you see if we don't take the next step oh welcome to our church we're we're christians we're serving god together we believe the message you stop too short too quick this adoption is not adopted to the church this is not adopted to the message this is not adopted to this is adopted to jesus christ to himself hallelujah well i'll tell you what my brother and sister you say brother paul i don't what's the emphasis on that i'm telling you there's a lot of adoptions taking place but not all of them are to christ hello hello according good pleasure of his will to the praise oh can i say once again it is written this is not opinion this is not surmising this it is written hallelujah to the praise of the glory of his grace wherein he hath made us acceptable accepted i mean in the beloved you know the word accepted is oh you english people no not by ancestry i mean those of you speak english i don't remember what you call that but in the context of that phrase right there i can't give you words to explain in the context of that phrase the word accepted is completely and absolutely past tense it's not you will be you are and if i have already been received in adoption and already been accepted in the beloved i can stand right now having been put through trials anybody have any fiery trials amen been put through the trial and oh i tell you my brother and sister the morning i woke up and realized that god had handed me a checkbook and that my name on that checkbook was just as good as his name on that checkbook and he said you ask anything in my name and i will cast this check and so it's in that position we can come not with power but i have the authority of my father i'm the authority of the one whose name is on the heading of the check and all i've got to do is sign off of it ask anything come on my brother and sister god knows you're not going to ask for cash he knows you're not going to ask for ego and this and that and fine clothes and trips to the mediterranean or maybe even just a house there no he knows you're not going to he knows that you signed that check and it's for my child and it is for my wife and it is for my husband and it is for my brother it is for my sister it is for everyone in the body of believers that's who i want to write a check for i don't have a selfish spirit i don't have a selfish desire lord i want to write a check for your body for your family for the needs of this church hallelujah oh because i'm already can someone say that i'm already accepted hallelujah in whom we have redemption through his blood the forgiveness of sins according to the riches of his grace wherein he hath abounded towards us in all wisdom and prudence now look at this i want to go along i wasn't going to read all this scripture but i think i think we shouldn't having made known to us unto us the mystery of his will isn't that why there's like thousands of denominations now because everyone's got a different interpretation of the mystery of god's will well i tell you what if we do a whole lot more praying lord what did you mean and a whole lot less of this is what he meant we'd have a lot more answers a lot more unity you know pardon me for doing this have a little insider knowledge but my brother and sister god never ever ever said in his word we're going to have unity by getting together and singing a bunch of songs but he did say amen right here is where you will find liberty and unity this is where you'll find what you need and it's not get there saints i will sound selfish here do you mind if i sound selfish for a moment when it comes down to the ultimate depth of a personal relationship i'm not as concerned about your position as i am about my own amen because you see i can't put you in a rapture we could pray every day we could cry we could weep we could shout we can sing and i can't make you and you can't make me that's right but i tell you what i can sure have a whole lot more not picking on you get real but i can have a whole lot more influence on this young lady's life if i've got the holy ghost not i've got an opinion i've got influence no if i've got the holy ghost i'll have way more influence oh god help us a little less in opinion a little more of the holy ghost what a change that will be amen somebody help me here fullness of times gathered together in one all things in christ that's unity both which are in heaven which are on earth even in him in whom also we have obtained an inheritance i like that idea being predestinated according to the purpose of him who worketh all things after counsel of his own will we're back to god's will understanding that will knowing what it is and letting the holy ghost lead us instead of now an example of that my brother and sister most of us without the influence of god in our life would think that money would cure our problems just think with me right just in the carnal realm the carnal realm it's like seriously it's hard for us see now here's the thing it's hard for us to separate that thought because that's not where we dwell but just kind of take one good look at your carnal self and if you woke up tomorrow and somebody called you up and said oh no you're not going to buy a lottery ticket because you're a christian but i don't know publishing clearinghouse or this that or something you know how they always have these things and and we're going to give you um you know i forget i just heard a little deal the other day payment not to exceed eight hundred ninety five dollars a week i don't even make that a month yeah that would help fix some of my problems except for it won't because that's not what god ordained for you he said my word is what will change you it's my word that is the healing for the wilderness it is my word that would change your life but most of us well bill gates years ago some journalist said bill gates is so rich he could not afford walking down the sidewalk if there was a hundred dollar bill laying on the ground bill gates could not afford to take the time to bend over and grab that hundred dollar bill somebody else that read that article who had some way into this gets a hold to bill gates and says mr gates if you were walking down the sidewalk you saw a 100 bill laying there and it's probably not worth your while to pick it up but and he said what do you mean he said i'm not walking past 100 bill but i'm looking for big blessings brother i'm looking for speaking in tongues i'm looking for this i'm looking for all these things don't step over the simple things of the gospel in your life don't step over it is written in your life don't step over the promises for the little changes and it is there because remember you have to guard against the little fox don't just look for the wolf we'll guard the wolf and we'll leave the in-house door open until we see a wove no the little fox can come in there too so grab a hold of those little promises of the word it is written it is written it is written oh i'm having a terrible day but i tell you what i'm predestinated i've been called to god according to adoption unto him i don't need to have some great revelation i can just take what is written and now what he wrote he wrote it for you and i oh i'm so distracted off my thoughts forgive me amen in whom also ye also trusted after you heard the word of truth the gospel of your salvation and whom also after that you believe you were well i don't know if the seals are off limits then i don't know come on i don't make this as an emphatic statement but everything up to the sixth seal deals you might say in a global perspective you follow me the seventh seal dealt with the bride specifically the seventh seal was to that bride that god called that's identified by his word but sorry you guys stay lined up at the queue the door is closed until a later date no sir we just seen some of the most tragic things happen in just the last few weeks charlie and rachel their house explodes heart-rending heart rate a young couple with all their life in front of them i love how the news is some neighbor told a reporter well i don't know what's going on there might be suspicious you know i heard screaming before the house blew up maybe just killed her yeah sorry devil sorry devil you can smear anything you want but it ain't going to stick now look at this other family driving home from church somebody swerves strikes the back of another car their car flips through the air and lands right on their car kills the husband who hadn't been in church in a long time and been serving god but because of what happened with charlie and rachel he comes back gives his heart back to god oh it's so fortunate that he gave his heart back to the lord before he died no sir that was perfectly in footsteps it is written it is written i shall not lose a oh look how our god works saints amen he tells you right here that you trusted after you heard the word of truth and you realized it was a gospel of your salvation also after you believed you were what sealed amen not superficial not intellectual but sealed down in the depths of a soul and what is that seven seal nothing less than jesus christ himself coming down to you and i and sealing us oh not wrapping us in denomination not wrapping us in some kind of organization wrapping us in him oh thank you lord i now have confidence to live in this life hallelujah oh my i got to move on here hey now look we see what is written amen you see this is not a mystery of a man it's a revelation of jesus christ amen now look i want you to catch this here if you would i'm kind of lost here i've got lost in my own thoughts and and things here excuse me oh my help me lord what is it you desire lord hallelujah do we oh my brothers do we have do we have uh this day the scripture is fulfilled okay i just got myself a rod up here excuse me now i want you to look at this we have had a revelation of the son of god but the last promise that abraham had before the son was made or brought into existence the one that he had been promised one been promised yeah before the promised son showed up god manifested himself there at sodom as a prophet being a man in flesh god amen elohim as i heard someone speak it a while ago which was godhead bodily was in him he was the fullness elohim is the fullness of the godhead bodily and we notice there when lot saw now paul's when abraham saw him coming he said my lord one he had a clear identification but the my is possessive right he looked at and said that's my lord what about the other guys look at that there was three of them and down in sodom lot saw two and said my lords look at this lack of revelation now if lot had been in the word and were able to say it is written it had a different perspective but you see you can't just put someone we got modern day theological schools i just watched an interview with a young man it really was not a it was a promotion for this independent theological school now i want you to catch this i hope you do catch this so this is an infomercial type of a thing microphone and why did you choose this school to come and study to for the ministry well sir i was getting out of high school i went to one year of college and i looked around and i thought i don't know what i want to do because this career i like this but the employment numbers are going down and i want to do this over here but it don't pay very much and i looked at that and i thought well if i just become a pastor of a church i would have a good career path with good compensation anyway um we're gonna pass the offering plate again before you guys leave today because the compensation part ain't working too well come on this is why we're serving god is this why we do what we do oh i tell you it's not at all my brother and sister there's not a man there's not a man sitting here has ever ministered the gospel that had a thought about the money about the money about the money and if he did his ministry would be ineffective be ineffective god would not bless that so what does it do it comes down the revelation of my lord is revelation amen it's not taught to us oh it can be taught we can recite it but you can get a parrot oh you'll like this little video i've seen recently a parrot doing the alphabet yes that's good i don't want the parrot right notebook for me now the red wire goes to the detonator and the blue wire goes to the and the parrot's like i don't remember it was the other way around i like blue red first i'm a truck driver red on right oh i don't remember boom no come on saints god never trusted the word for that god anchored anchored the word and put it there and how did he anchor it in revelation peter didn't get that and go off to school hmm i'm getting sidetracked i've been sidetracked so long this morning you guys wouldn't know where i'm at amen but look at this by revelation right one sees god elohim another sees two lords no wonder people are confused yeah to those who by revelation see we'll go back to our original scripture blessed is he that readeth and they that hear the words of this prophecy and keep those things which are written therein for the time is at hand isn't this beautiful now look i i am so far over and i'm going to do that brother dwayne fair thing can i just have five minutes five ten fifteen twenty thirty that'll be enough yeah now look at this we're turning esther the sixth chapter and i'm gonna go through here really fast now look at this there's a night i'm not going to read all the scripture just follow it on a night the king can't sleep and so he asked them to go get the book of records of the chronicles this is all that's happening in the kingdom amen and they were read before the king and it was found what written that mordecai told of uh big fenna and taresh two of the king's chamberlain's the keepers of the doors sought to lay hand on the king and so he says you know what what did we do for them and that they've done you know and he says nope we haven't done anything for him nothing done at all for him now look at this and the king says who's in the court now i want to take this over in a spiritual realm if you can just step over there with me now my brother and sister the devil is always outside the door you better believe the devil's outside the door he never lays down he never gets tired of his job he's already there but have you ever noticed there's times that god uses the devil oh there's times that god uses the devil he'll let man get so full of himself and then so fed up with himself and the whole time the devil's just feeding it feeding it feeding it until the day that god says done and then the devil says what malfunction i can't figure out did i get the blue wire wrong or the red wire wrong what went wrong here but you see as it is that this time this coming and the king now esther the bride is outside of this right now and the king himself is just looking back through his writings the writings the record now you've got to remember this is the record of god and haman typed as the devil has been keeping his own keeping his own excuse me i don't mean to be rude see the difference in the amount of notes here [Laughter] i don't mean to embarrass you but this is a beautiful point and i don't make no type i don't make no type to nothing please don't don't misunderstand but you see god's got some notes that are short and sweet and the devil's got extensive notes oh man sister gary it is a beautiful type though both sides keeping notes and haman's been into the king saying there's a people in the land they're trouble and i have kept a record of everything they've done i've got it all down in king i'm going to lay this record out before you and you're going to sign a decree now look saints this was so efficient that the king had the decree written signed it oh i hope you catch this and even put a seal upon it thou shall not steal thou shall not commit adultery thou shalt not covet and the king put his seal on it now imagine coming before the king one day the king what is the record of my life you lied you cheated you stole you lusted you've coveted you've done all of this how could we what would be our argument what would we say i nev because our own conscience would become the video playing before life and we'd say i did it forgive me lord but i did it and the devil would be right there as the accuser look what happens somewhere in the midst of this god intervenes how can someone say thank you lord before we come to that judgment god says i'm here to intervene because you see in the dark of the night i have got some records of my own i've got some recordings of my own and i have come and i have heard what those recordings are and this is my son and this is my daughter and i am going to intervene before satan can come and put his final stroke as it were and so it's there in that we see now did we we do something for mordecai and they said no nothing's done and he said who's in the court and the devil was out there he come in the outward court of the king's house why to speak to the king to hang mordecai i'm going to bring judgment on this guy right in the early hours of the morning but what he forgot was to read the scripture that said the lord's mercies we're new and fresh every morning he comes in there yes what will we do for a man you know haman was like i'm the man i'm telling you what we're not doing this halfway we're not giving him chicken wings we're giving him the whole chicken and so he comes and he says what would you do and he tells them then let's just go on here bounce that to the next scriptures there brothers and the king said to him what shall be done and haman thought in his heart to whom with the king delight to do honor more than myself you know after all church i mean being the pastor that makes me more spiritual than all of you obviously right hmm [Music] no not one problem god chose man puts him in an office and then that man's got his own fiery trial it's just in a different office and we won't even put it in office as in position office as in location it won't matter africa asia europe south america north america australia wherever that man is at he's still got his own firing oh let's see i mean after all and he answers the king for a man whom the king delighteth on or let the see the devil doesn't even know what he's saying saints are you with me are we on the same page this morning you know what i i want to curse this guy i want to hang this guy i'm going to do away with these people i'm going to judge it because every christian now remember satan's got some very good insight and every christian that ever said i'm going to live for the lord i'm going to die for the lord i'm going to commit myself to it the devil sees this he sees this and he sees this yeah and on a bad day he has to use shorthand to catch it all so what i would do i'd wrap him in royal apparel that's what i would do yup yup that the king wore not someone else's concept this is a peril the king has won what does the word say about the word the word is god in written form amen so when we go to put on apparel do you know what the devil oh i'm getting drawn out saints i'm sorry are we okay for a couple more minutes you know when the devil comes under religious spirit he wants to come and he says oh wrap yourself in the word no problem you see but he's got denominational mind because that's where that spirit come from they're going to wrap themselves in a religious spirit no problem but what he doesn't know is the bride is so literal that when she says wrap myself in the word she starts oh i hope you don't mind she just starts wrapping this around her and she becomes the word amen i don't know how it happened saints come on the prophet goes in a little room and and the people go in the little room and they come out and they ask them what happened in there i don't know and i can't tell you either but when i started wrapping myself in this word something started changing in my life i became a new creature in christ jesus i become a different individual do i have bad days don't have sister jerry please but i'll tell you what's happened the devil's trying to wrap you in a religious spirit but the apparel amen is being wrapped around you and so that word is become your very life it's your very identity and so then he says you know what and the horse that the king writeth upon and the crown royal which is set upon his head now remember we are the bride we're not the king we're the bride to the king and so when we're looking at this my brother and sister everything it's there has a spiritual type that is showing a position that god called you and i to take and not to just take it superficial but to take it as though our life depended on it and it does imagine now i'm sorry i hope you don't think i'm weird but i actually have a degree of humor when i read this because i i know some haman's they have different names on earth here but i've known some haman's that would one breath tell you you don't even have one bit of understanding of the word of god the next breath i think i'll bust your knees thank you brother haman i mean yeah if i told you some of you would know and that wouldn't be right so so what does he do he says deliver this and then oh besides that i think so much of you haman you lead the horse come on haman wasn't nearly as important in this program as he thought he was amen so you look at this now look i've got to i've got to move on here i'm sorry uh uh so it's there now i want to interject in the middle of that psalm 27 so if we have that brothers pop that up there if you would uh psalms 27 and we'll just kind of move on here psalms 27 5 says for in the time of trouble he shall hide me in my pavilion in my revelation in the church of my choice he said for in the time of trouble he shall hide me in his pavilion in the secret of his tabernacle shall he hide me he shall set me upon a rock now look don't take this literal don't i just trying to make a point to you in the time of trouble we face trouble right more troubles coming but the secret of his tabernacle now a tabernacle is a dwelling place amen so it's there that he's going to hide me in myself are you with me i'm not trying to change doctrine i'm not trying to twist nothing i want you to catch this he's going to hide me in myself why we are the house the tabernacle right he shall hide me and he shall set me on a rock of revelation in myself now it is not revelation i have of myself but the revelation that he's setting in my life he didn't come and pass out a pamphlet this is revelation day so you get it before i get it they get it and that and so so it is there that god is moving in his time and his position giving revelation to you and i and if you notice it's often times in the time of trouble that we dig deeper than we ever dug before and we submit ourselves to the will of god deeper than we've ever submitted before and god uses trouble god has harnessed trouble to bring us into his presence and it's there in that time of trouble because we're not quitters if there's any quitters here this morning you're dismissed because i'm going to make a bold declaration no quitter ever received the baptism of the holy ghost no quitter ever was filled from the brim to the brim of almighty god no quitter can stand because the fiery trial is too much for the quitter but to sit here today and receive the word of god and face every trial and be able to say in the time of trouble not he shall hide me he has hid me i am hid in him oh hallelujah i'm sorry i'm so excited this morning amen and he said i'll lift my head above my enemies around about me therefore oh i love this last closing therefore will i offer in his tabernacle come on saints right here in his tabernacle i shall offer praises unto the lord amen oh we aren't writing a note to a priest we aren't writing a note to some great authority it's your lips your heart your spirit crying out to the lord and then you will sing and you will make sacrifices of joy well brother paul if you knew our situation i don't know what your situation is but i'm telling you my brother and sister god didn't put a caveat on here unless there's marriage problems unless there's problems in the family unless there's money problems unless there's problems in the church then you don't have to do this he said if you have been in the time of trouble i'll hide you i'll hide you saints it's written this is not paul this morning this is a word of god it's written oh hallelujah i'm telling you what i want to dwell in the house of the lord forever amen hallelujah yeah i already touched on this way out order that's fine because that's when satan desires to defeat you he uses not the words of his book he uses the words of this book you'll not find a quotation recorded thus saith lucifer he condemns us with this book and he tries to judge us with this book but i turn to another page and it says it was written of you and i it is that we were in him amen before come on can we get far enough back before the foundation of the world oh before there was any ability in us to sin or be influenced by unbelief we were in him and i can't find a single word where he said i'm done with you but i do find a word where it is written he said they can't pluck you out of my hands how can someone say thank you lord this morning sister emmy would you just come i've got to stop here hallelujah but the king my king your king amen he's got his own record book and i'm so glad of that amen hallelujah look at this let's look at this my brother and sister first peter once again let me back up just a hair further see my son little redundant forgive me lord has his own record book he's got his own record haman had a record but the king didn't say go get haman's book he said bring me the book of the record of my kingdom thank you lord hallelujah not going to take someone else's word for it but let's church can we just rejoice for a moment do we have enough time i've been long can we rejoice for just a moment we look today by how i don't have a page in the bible that says paul haley i redeemed you but i have page after page that says i'm redeemed what is this revelation and it's written in the book but we have to get in the right spirit and the right attitude in the right atmosphere and then the words leap off the page and we realize he was talking about me the whole time the whole time talking about me oh praise god saints it's written in the book but it's revelation and then it got sealed in there with the blood of jesus christ sealed in there can be taken out oh my look at this now first peter come on who identifies with first peter yep yep yep confession time [Music] god's still working on me god is still working on me [Music] and i look at this scripture and all i can say is thank you lord why he kept me he kept me to those who are kept by the power of god how did god do this through faith [Music] and then what did the prophet of god say about faith faith is revelation but you see faith my brother and sister it's not something this is where we get messed up people think i got saved gave my heart to the lord i've got faith yes you do but your faith is buried underneath anxiety underneath fear underneath all kinds of other things and so god knows how to do this just the other day watching a great big excavator now to me that's a beautiful thing saints an excavator yeah somebody look at me like he's got a problem but i tell you what if you've ever watched someone that's a professional excavator it's nice and smooth [Music] i know this is boring [Music] it's beautiful [Music] and i'll show you the difference here's paul [Music] and you say why are you making such a silly example because the overburden in our life [Music] the holy ghost comes down and when we need faith he doesn't just accidentally rip your heart out he doesn't maim you he gracefully uncovers faith in our life and we suddenly look in our life and there is faith for the challenge of our day there's faith for the circumstance we're facing when man tries to uncover faith in you run run because man can't do it but the holy ghost gracefully where you submit to the operation of the holy spirit god does that can someone say thank you who are kept by the power of god through faith unto salvation oh i'd love to put a space in here you know i'm i'm real fun if you look at my notes i don't use punctuation colon semicolons commas i just put saves time you don't have to move your finger to all these other things i love dots amen god threw faith into salvation [Music] ready to be revealed in the last time i have faith you have faith it's right here and god's revealing it god's revealing it god's revealing it oh come on some of you are frowning at me now i know i went over the time hallelujah amen probably brother jason or brother chris will buy you lunch [Music] but look my brother and sister god's promised he's going to reveal this faith in this last time and somebody ought to stand up and say lord i'm claiming that i'm claiming that lord every bit of faith i need i'm claiming it today i'm claiming it for the challenge i'm going through and if you had a fiery trial in the last week and you sat down and the devil tried to tell you you aren't a christian you aren't this you aren't that then you stop and say look satan just as my lord spoke to you on the pinnacle of the temple i speak to you it is written and the word said i'm a son of god i'm a daughter of god i'm the bride of christ and i'm wrapped in his word oh hallelujah oh this is a season of revelation saints and christ said i'll reveal myself in you hallelujah oh please stand amen my oh my now you guys are going to find this real humorous in a bad sort of way but i sat here this morning and i thought well lord i just hope i have enough to even preach this morning [Music] oh my goodness my goodness well i'd warn you but faith's pretty good isn't it amen some of you the reason i'm still preaching i liked how brother dwayne brother dwayne fair put that did you guys catch how he just threw that right back on you i would have stopped already but you guys pulling [Music] so i it's not my fault we had a long service it's your fault yeah did you notice that brother andrew glover said a very similar statement also i'm telling you saints it's not the ministry's fault but i don't want you to quit pulling keep pulling we've got time it's sunday our day to be in the house of god are today to be in his presence our day to rejoice in all the rest of this our day to grasp the holds of something of eternal value hallelujah hallelujah thank you lord brother jay will you come help me i like to sing that song i think it's father of life we cry out your name hallelujah saints i know probably got places to go i'm sorry but let's just take a moment let's cry out to him this morning i don't say this to be intrusive in your life but do you have needs is there things in your life that you need the lord to come on the scene then cry out his name don't sit there silent just hoping god will come and do something cry out because i want to just bring it back to you ask anything in my name my oh my saints he didn't say you know i'll read your mind surprise you you have to ask ask [Music] only by your mercy we are safe lord you have said if we call upon your name oh lord we and our family [Music] i [Music] lord jesus [Music] we rely on your grace [Music] jesus christ oh father of love never failing to forgive thank each moment is a gift from you to live and we're only here to tell the world about your grace until the day you take us all away so we cry out your name [Music] jesus christ we rely on your grace in [Music] praise jesus christ look if there's a father here that has children that have a need you should be crying out if there's a man here with a marriage problem you should be crying out a wife with a marriage problem you should be crying out you see a need in another person in another family you should be crying out this is how god answers prayer not from the you being mute not from satan paralyzing you that your prayer makes no difference but you should be crying out and i tell you as a pastor i want to see you say i want to see you blessed but i don't want to see you step forward in your own on your own not as a baby not as a weakling but as a daughter of god as a son of god and start crying out and claiming what god has already given you oh brother paul don't interfere in our life i'm not i'm not you've never seen me once come and pound on your door but god wants to come down he's knocking on the door of hearts today he's asking you just trust me just believe me start with a simple word maybe it's just the words lord we need you speak those words hallelujah high and lifted up hallelujah [Music] hallelujah hallelujah someone say pray hallelujah said if i be lifted up i will surely draw men unto me so as moses raised the serpent in the wilderness so high and lifted up must jesus be see him on the cross his eyes of love looking down on all who stood and watched his shame as they mocked him and they scratched him god turned his eyes away so high and lifted up he took [Music] i lifted up for all to see reconciling on a man forever [Music] jesus said i'll surely come again that wherever i may be you will be near so i'm looking toward the heavens up to the eastern sky where high and lifted up he shall appear hallelujah beautiful there to meet a bride adorned and waiting as all of heaven's angels start to [Music] as high [Music] is [Music] foreign [Music] and all of heaven's angels got to sing never bored to be a lonely man of god [Music] [Applause] [Music] is [Applause] [Music] can we just give a little phrase to him oh lord thank you lord chief oh hallelujah thank you lord jesus blessed be the name of our lord and savior hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah amen like to sing that song all things are ready now saints do we have just another moment amen brother jose's children i don't know who old brother jose is singing with your boys or it's mama they had a desire and we see the leading start of the service but i want them to be able to express that desire something that means something to them to share you know i think more of us ought to catch that desire maybe as they're walking by they can kind of hallelujah i mean i've got a video on my phone gabriella playing the piano and singing a song to us it is the evening time would you guess how many years ago [Music] really close we call that history i've heard some of these voices oh we all start looking towards the windows and the walls and the lights whatever come on saints we're not doing this for man we're doing this to the lord and i'm not trying to force you to do it just a little bit of guilt but you see we've got an awesome god and we ought to pour every bit of the fiber of our being into worshiping him hallelujah it is the evening time you think the bride is preparing now for the lord to me all things are ready now for i grew my heart [Music] amen you may have your seats no no it's too complicated [Music] wow let's see

scriptures concerning himself when he said it is written and we have the same authority by the same revelation of who we are lord that we can say it is written it just doesn't become a head knowledge
