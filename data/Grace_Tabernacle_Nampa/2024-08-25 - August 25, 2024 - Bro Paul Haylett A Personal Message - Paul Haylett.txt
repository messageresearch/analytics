fail you can't fall I'm here to redeem you I'm already paid the price and he's going to redeem everything that he has purchased amen makes us think about uh various things in the scripture uh Ruth being one of those uh and um we we see how that God ordained everything that happened in her life we we don't look at it as something to Rejoice the loss of it were a husband the troubles but to realize God had something so much greater for Ruth down the road she just had to be patient and wait on the Lord and when she waited she made those words which just struck me so much as I was looking at them a few days ago uh where thou goest I will go your God will be my god oh how powerful those words are how the effect they have upon our life amen you know um just want to speak to you this morning on a personal message and uh got a couple greetings here Brother David Iverson uh uh pastors a church in Nazareth Belgium uh he sends greetings from his family and the Saints uh there in Nazareth God bless you thank you so much and um so uh he sends his greetings and I took the liberty to send our greetings back with them Amen Brother David sister Esther are just wonderful wonderful

planning any quick spontaneous weekends away um amen hallelujah let's just stand and just take a moment I think that just an inspiration of my heart there as I was still seated there let's just take a moment lift our hands and thank the Lord for what he's done for us he has done so much for us and I think it's just good for us just to just come you say it's not very spontaneous brother Paul but you know sometimes uh just uh putting out that effort to say Lord I thank you I thank you Lord Jesus for your grace your mercy Satan would come in this hour Lord he's doing everything he can to disrupt the bride of Christ but Lord for us to be raised in Heavenly places in you we must be in you and you must be in us and Lord we're here today to say thank you for that Lord just ask you to speak to every need Lord many requests no doubt that are not even pinned or posted today but father we would ask you Lord just to come and move on behalf of the Saints may your presence come and move us today by your Holy Spirit we say thank you from the depths of our hearts Lord and we bless your Holy Name hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah let's turn in Revelations 3 uh verse 18- 22 and uh we will draw out of this um it goes right into a quote I'm going to read also has this uh scripture in it uh Revelations 3 and18 I counsel thee to buy of me gold tried in the fire that thou mayest be rich and white rment that thou mayest be clothed that the shame of thy nakedness do not appear so we recognize my brother and sister in the world we're are living today they have no shame of their nakedness and uh they they don't even recognize in a spiritual context that that they are not clothed by the word and uh so it is there that the shame of thy nakedness does not appear and anoint thine eyes with isav that thou mayest see as many as I love I rebuke and chasen be zealous therefore and repent behold I stand at the door and knock and if any man hear my voice and open the door I will come into him and will sck with him and he with me when I read verse 20 I often think about those Saints on the road to we at the beckoning our lord Jesus went in and SED with them but if they had not beckoned him he would have passed on his way but there was something real burning in their hearts and they said hey you you need to come in we need more of this fellowship please come and sit with us and it was there in the breaking of the bread amen Revelation come he revealed himself to them and my imagine they're just scuffing their feet along on the road to Emmas they're dejected they feel like something's malfunctioned and at the breaking of the bread now I just put it this way it's how I see it in the scripture they skipped their way back where they drugged their feet to go they were full of joy and they rushed back to tell of a revelation God had given them now I don't want this to sound too harsh but my brother and sister we have Revelations come God speaks to our heart about things in our lives and we just keep on dragging our feet something's wrong something's wrong we should have a joy in our heart we should be so full of of this presence that God has given us in this hour that that we go through the ups and downs of life let's face it amen I always feel better when the sun is shining amen now I say this kind of in a little bit of a pun but uh just visiting with some brothers uh from uh the state of Washington uh the sister Alice lives there she knows what I'm talking about and you need to fall in love with liquid Sunshine that's what you need to fall in love with that but you see I'm glad God called me here I don't know what he how he called you but I'm glad that I'm here because liquid sunshine just doesn't work for me I need the real sunshine and when you know Sister Jerry bought me a a lamp here a few years ago and I forget what they call them I call it my depression lamp amen and that's the one you sit under at Vitamin D whatever it is that lamp shining on you and and I can just does feel good sitting under that lamp and then I broke it and I haven't had one for quite a while and and I I think that's why I'm so depressed but look at this my brother and sister we have a light we have a presence that nothing in this world can take away amen let's not let the cares of Life beat us down take a hold to the word Let It Shine Let It Shine Let It Shine don't hide it under a bushel no Let It Shine one of these days we ought to have the kids sing that to us amen as many as I love I rebuke and chasen be zealous therefore and repent behold I stand at the door and knock and if any man hear my voice and open the door I will come into him and will Su with him and he with me to him that overcometh will I grant to sit with me in my throne even as I also overcome and I'm set down with my father in his throne he that hath an ear let him hear what the spirit saith unto the churches Heavenly Father we ask you to come every prayer request every unspoken request every need father Lord you are here Lord and we are more than capable to withstand the onslaught of the enemy Lord we have the word we have you in our life now father we just need to let that Joy shine forth father let you uh speak to our hearts in such a fashion Lord they experienced on the road to emus father that was not just a little try to encourage but the word was being broken and father I believe in this day that we're living in the word is still being broken it is still being open to us it is still given to us to Su upon it now father I ask you to bless this service today every need every circumstance bind every contrary spirit and loose the Holy Spirit I pray in the name of Jesus Christ amen you may be seated amen now I don't say this is a poll but don't you just love your church age book amen I believe when I read the church age book that it it uh uh maybe I didn't word that quite right it's not I believe I know that it actually opens up many other things to me I I when I read it I I start to realize there's certain aspects of the message that we read or scripture that we read and uh we read that in you might say our interpretation our thinking uh uh what we've experienced in life and brother Bram says here in the church age book uh that uh he says it's a scripture here again uh behold I stand at the door and knock and if any any man hear my voice and open the door I will come into him amen now my brother and sister I just want you to answer this to yourself today did you open the door amen there's the key right there it's not a matter whether he's knocking or not it's now an action that's up to you and I did we open the door or did we leave the little chain you know how it is uh some residents have it motel rooms the little chain that slides in the slot only allows the door to be opened so far you might look through that crack and see Jesus my brother and sister but that is not him coming in to S with you you have to completely open the door and so it's there he says I'll come into him and Su with him and he with me to him that overcometh will I grant to sit with me in my throne even as I also overcame and am sat down with my father and his throne now my brother and sister we are this is such an incredible scripture to me because he has now given to us a glimpse of the reward of being an overcomer now I I just uh want you guys to break your nice quiet studious thoughts this morning and kind of stretch a little bit uh get up on the edge of the nest put your little uh claws in there and let's flap some wings amen and just let the Lord know that we're going to praise him today but aren't you happy today my brother and sister that the reward to the Overcomer can we say I'm an overcomer amen the reward to the Overcomer my brother and sister it's not a fruitless labor but it is a labor that truly has reward in it amen and so here it is brother brandham goes on to say and you can catch that right here in in uh uh the quote there's a great deal of confusion over this verse because so many personal workers use it in a personal evangelism as though Jesus were at the hearts door of every sinner knocking for admission it would then be said that if the sinner opened the door the Lord would come in but this verse is not talking to individual Sinners amen so you'll see that that it is not so much that that God has come down uh to knock at the door of every sinner now don't get confused because he does come and knock at the door of every sinner but the prophet's talking about the church age here and representing what happens or or the atmosphere of that age so the Lord would come in but the verse is not talking to individuals the whole message is a uh I practiced that word and I can't get it out now summation as does every message in every age in verse 22 it says he that hath an ear let him hear what the spirit saith into the churches so it's not dealing with individuals at this point of time but it's dealing with the churches with the church age that is coming and God has come and certainly in the day that we live in and he has been knocking amen but you'll see that the door not being opened does not bring the presence of Christ in there and so we'll just go on here so this is the message to the Church of the last age this is a condition of the leod dean church as its end nears it is not a personal message to one person it is a spirit telling us where Jesus is Christ has left the church is this not The Logical result or end if the word is put outside for creed Holy Spirit disposed of for popes Bishops presidents counselors Etc and the Savior set aside for a Works program or church joining or some time of conformity and I think Saints one of the worst things we can do is conform to the message we're not here to conform to the message we're here to catch a revelation of the message and when we catch the me Revelation of the message you'll say but I am conforming but if it's by Revelation nothing can take it away from you no other explanation no other circumstance no trial of life no fiery darts of the enemy nothing will take it away from you but if you you just conform sooner or later you'll find an easier path you'll find an easier way and so as he says here uh sometime conformative Church system what more can be done against him see this is what's happening in the religious world today Saints is not just simply a a spirit causing people to interpret and to do this but this is actually a direct assault against our Lord Jesus Christ amen when you refute repudiate or refuse his word that is actually a direct assault against him brother brandham says this is the apostasy this is the falling away this is the open door to the Antichrist for if one came in his father's name Jesus and was not received but rejected then there will come another with his own name liar Pretender and him they will receive John 5:43 the man of sin that son of predition will take over now as we look at this my brother and sister is this not what we see in the world today amen I I try to not focus too much on this but I I was just the other day typed into a search engine about you know truth and and uh the the sharing of the truth and I hope you don't mind my slightly warped humor but you know it brought up a video of a Pentecostal woman preacher and uh she's there in the Pulpit hair about the length of mine uh I'm sorry I just need you to catch an image here I'm not degrading the woman she's just probably living all that she knows but she's there in a pant suit short hair a woman preacher and she's standing in the Pulpit telling a full church we'll settle for nothing less than the whole truth and I don't say that derogatory to them I hope you follow me but you see how subtle Satan has come to take all these different positions and they stand and say we'll stand for nothing less than the truth but not and then right below that search engine said you might also be interested in this and it went on in a whole another little topic that um was the question uh so Jesus said that they should not women should not dress like men and what is the difference a robe is a robe and they explain the scripture away this is the hour we're living in this is what the prophet of God is talking about here that they have come in the very House of God and they have taken his word and they have mollified the people with kind words and intellectual words and Inspirations the people are there saying oh yes that's good I'm fine but my brother and sister it's a spirit that is already been prophesied for the age the day that we live in and it's there and it's now being manifested now let's go on here Matthew 24 mentions signs in the heavens concerning uh this last day just before Jesus comes I wonder if you notice such a sign recently fulfilled as to portray the very truth we've been discussing that truth is that Jesus has been steadily pushed aside and until in the last age he's pushed outside the church recall that in the first age it was almost full orbit uh Church of Truth and he's talking about Sun and the Moon there yet there was little air called the Deeds of the nicians that kept the circle from being full then the next age more Darkness crept in until the ball of light glowed less and darkness covered more of the circle in the third age it was eclipsed still more and in the fourth age which was the Dark Ages the light had all but gone now think on this the church shines in the reflected Light of Christ he is the son can we say Amen the church is the moon and thus this orb of light is the Moon it had decreased from almost a full moon in the first age to a sliver in the fourth age but in the fifth age it began to grow and in the sixth it took a great step of growth forward and in part of the seventh age it was still growing when suddenly it stopped short and waned almost to nothingness what year did the prophet say America would receive Christ or go into judgment 1956 so we see clearly the time that the church was growing there was many signs and wonders powerful moves of God great times of repentance but then it comes to a place they had to make a decision and they made their decision and we don't criticize them for making the decision they made because my brother and sister the prophet of God said it's only the bride of Christ that can receive the revelation of Jesus Christ so it's there that they come to a place that that they've went as far as they can go amen have you ever went for a hike with some friends that are obviously much maybe younger much uh better Fitness whatever it might be and and you just simply come to a place that you say I have to sit down I have to stop right here I'm too tired to go on amen sister Jerry and I was uh with the youth in Ang go Chile uh quite a few years ago and they went on a hike to what is called Eagle Mountain and uh we we're going up there and and uh the deacons all had little radios and um uh they're they're calling on the radio and we can hear them them and they're saying uh uh watch out for brother Paul and sister Jerry they're older and and we don't want to lose them in the forest so watch out for them but the reality was brother Paul and sister Jerry had this sister's handbag and this sister's bag and this bag full of water and this bag over here of some snacks and we had this we look like pack mules but you see my brother and sister what is happening is there is a time that the people feel like because now I'm not judging these people don't misunderstand me but they all felt like because they were dying on this trail that surely we were dying on this Trail but I'll let you know right now this bride of Jesus Christ is not dying in leoa she is Victorious she's an overcomer she has taken the word and she's rising up not declining she's come to a place where God is pouring the strength into her it's not my strength it's not your strength it's his strength that he's pouring out into this bride of this day because he said I will give to the Overcomer and he said and I'm guaranteeing you're an overcomer you know sometimes co-signing a bank loan is not such a good idea but I'm telling you our Lord Jesus Christ come and our Redemption he signed his name our name is there only because we're agreeing with him he is the one that is backing the whole thing he's the one that is the strength and the force and the presence behind the whole thing and this bride that believes is going to be an overcomer because he said so it's not our strength it's not I failed I I must be a loser no my brother and sister when we fail is the time that God can take over he's not waiting for us well you know I'll let them burn their strength then I'll help them finish he can't do a thing for us until we completely rely upon him and if we complete that and let him uh uh uh come and do what he desires to do my brother and sister he takes very good care of us and I believe we can say Amen to that amen so I lost my place door of every sinner uh knocking for admission it would then be said that sinner opened the door the Lord would come in but this verse is not talking to individual Sinners the whole message has a summation as does every message in every age oh my brother and sister it's powerful when you think about that just stop and think about what's happening anybody had a trial this last week amen I think every hand here if we be honest we've had some sort of something that has come amen so what happens my brother and sister is we tend to view ourself in a critical light and God tends to view us as a people he's already purchased he's already uh holds the title deed we look at it as failure he looks at said it is character building amen but what really comes down to the Crux of this is he that hath an ear amen not everyone's going to listen but he that hath an ear what the spirit saith unto the churches so this message uh to the Church of the last age you see as we're coming here it's coming that the church being that reflection and darkness creeping in more and more and more an age the prophet of God said would be otic and it is he didn't say we were exempt from that he didn't say that none of this will affect you in fact the Book of Ecclesiastes says these things happen to the rich and the poor to the righteous and the unrighteous my brother and sister to realize that you're in Warfare and warfare is not predictable to the man who is fighting but it is there that we can express who we are we're not going to sit down on our sword we're not going to sit down and say whatever happens happens we're going to stand up and say yes I am weak and I have been bled I have suffered but I will still fight to the very end that's an overcomer the one that does not give up is the Overcomer not the one with a shiny armor that never had a battle never had a trial always seem to understand and have control of everything that's not the Overcomer the Overcomer will be battles scarred they will be bloody and they will still be standing saying I'm here to serve my God Amen so look the apostasy the falling away this is the open door for the Antichrist I'm just going to paraphrase some of this amen he wasn't received he was he was rejected but you see there's come others who have come the liar The Pretender and you look at this it is there my brother and sister as this comes and the the last eclipse of the moon you can tie it back into history here the the prophet of God it says the last eclipse of the moon was a total eclipse it waned to a total darkness in seven stages in the seventh stage total darkness came as the pope of Rome Paul I 6 went to Palestine to make a holy tour of Jerusalem he was a first pope to ever go to Jerusalem the pope is named Paul I 6 Paul was the first messenger and this man goes by that name notice it was this six or the number of man so taking the name but still being identified under the anointing of being man Amen brother Bram says it's not a coincidence and he went to Jerusalem the moon or the church went into total darkness you see what's happening here is sometimes we we I'm not saying we're deceived or we're we're not doing but we're looking we're looking looking maybe I should say Paul is looking so I don't infringe on any of you we're looking for total darkness out there the prophet of God's telling us total darkness is behind us it's already happened now I want to have you lift a hand again if you feel to do it how many of you fight fight fight seems like it's an endless fight you know why cuz you're in total darkness out there but we're not in total darkness in here we're in the light of the revelation of Jesus Christ in here but when you are walking in this world right now you are surrounded by complete absolute Darkness you say well I I sometimes just feel really low I feel yeah that's what it's like to walk through the darkness my brother and sister amen I I joked about being afraid of the dark here while back here in church and I it was kind of interesting to see a lot of you uh reactions you know some of you put on a bold face but but you know there was a little something there I realized they're afraid of the darkness well I'll tell you it all depends on where you're in the Darkness at if you're unfamiliar places the darkness doesn't bother you praise God I'm Not Afraid of the Dark I can walk out to the car in my driveway in the dark but let's place I see our sister Sarah's not here today Lord touch her but you go hiking brother Adam hunting you go in Far Away places and you know there's mountain lions and you know there's bears and you know whatever you have a whole different approach to walking around in the dark amen you know it's it's a just the atmosphere depends on where it's at and I hope you can follow my little analogy when you're in the house of God you're serving God Faithfully you're there amongst the Saints of like Precious Faith walking in the darkness of this world is not near the challenge when you're by yourself when you have no Fellowship when you're outside and you're facing all of this without any encouragement and the Devil comes in and starts to just nitpick and nibble away at your experience at your Revelation at who you are and my brother and sister that's why the devil likes to isolate people he likes to get them out on their Fringe and then start telling them God didn't send a profet there's no such thing as this there's no such thing as that days of Miracles are passed God doesn't do this that was this and it's there it's just the nitpicking away and when people are isolated spiritually that takes a toll let's not fool ourselves it takes a toll it starts to ease up on us and then pretty soon staying in bed on Sunday morning seems like a very logical thing to do but that's not what the word said the word said don't forsake so you see Satan likes to isolate and then once he isolates he starts to work on that you can watch it in nature how that uh wild animals specifically more like coyotes and wolves tend to hunt they pick one out of the herd isolated and then gang up on it amen I tell you so we see the pope goes to Jerusalem the church goes into total darkness prophet of God says this is it this is the end and the generation shall not pass away until all things fulfilled even so Lord come quickly now I I've I've got through the negative part are we all still doing okay amen we'll move on into the positive part in the busyness of Life anybody very busy isn't that strange in the world we live in you know it used to be you know that people I I I can speak from the world of being a farmer it used to be farmers were some of the most faithful churchgoing people now they Farm seven days a week because that's what it takes to make it but if you have God on your side you don't have to farm seven days a week but you see they've left Christ on the outside now they're doing it under that sixth age anointing and they're trying to fulfill fill it on their own so uh in the busyness of life it's easy to forget that these things are coming to pass we're living life we're working we're doing and my brother and sister I believe I believe it's all my heart I don't have the research to back it up but I just believe it that we would be stunned if we literally had on Page in front of us all of the things that have been fulfilled in the scripture since we have become adults or been believer understand I think it might stun us so many little keys in the scripture that have been fulfilled we didn't even see it it would be encouraging to know would it but God didn't say you'll serve me because you see it coming to pass he said you'll serve me because it's in you it's in your heart it's in your soul not that you have evidence that's why my brother and sister we don't want to get too caught up now I hope this doesn't offend anyone but we see people around the message that say I believe the message cuz it's Vindicated if it wasn't Vindicated would you believe it there should be something inside of us that is actually the Vindication that the soul says Amen to the word of God that ought to be what makes it believable and livable and desirous to us not that we can pull out a long list this and this and this and this and this my brother and sister that's not what it's about it's about that personal experience and going back to my title today my brother and sister we'll we'll run into a little bit of a paradox here but you'll find that that uh it makes sense okay a personal message amen do you realize I can take what the prophet of God said and the word of God and prove to you amen that this message of this day that came and I just spoke out of one side of my mouth I got to speak out of the other and was Vindicated was not Vindicated to the world it wasn't Vindicated to message churches it was Vindicated to you that's what God was doing he was proving to you it's not now pardon me for using the word or organization it just seems to be the word that comes to my mind was not proven to the organization of the message it was not proven to the churches of the message it was proven to you because there'll come a time the prophet of God prophesied that the doors will be closed amen they have a hard time turning this one into a warehouse unless they plan on packing everything in but it won't stop them from shutting it down amen you know when we bought the church the people who looked at it right before us the only people who looked at it before us wanted to make a daycare out of this and so there's lots of uses that they can they can use it for but I believe we'll see that come to pass that the day will come that they will just say no we have determined that you're preaching hate that you're preaching discontent doing all these things and those things will come to pass and if we're not careful we're so busy looking forward at what's going to take place before the coming of the Lord that we have missed all these hundreds of things that the Lord has done already in our midst in our families in this body of Believers we need to get clarity to realize God never stopped moving he's not waiting for a certain Bell to chime a certain thing he's moving God's moving God's moving he's never stopped moving my brother and sister because the word will not wait for anything or anyone amen hallelujah so we see this it's coming right before our eyes now brother brandham gives some clarity here when he said this passage is not to the individual but to an age a church as the whole and we see that coming to pass amen all kinds of lunacy that would qualify lunacy taking place you see this also fits what the prophet told us the world is gathering in a building and they call it a house of God brother brandham said it's a lodge and so we're seeing that coming to pass today and we have to be but now on a really move to the good stuff you know there has been a paradigm shift amen have have you guys experienced the Paradigm Shift amen where we believe the message kind of coasted along you know and then a paradigm shift come and we realize it's later than we think amen it's a time for us to get serious about serving God we know it's true it's been confirmed in our own heart mind and soul and it's time for us to get serious about this and then people come and they want to know what happened to you I'll tell you what happened to you the Holy Ghost is what happened to us it's a move of God Chang ing Our Lives getting us ready because the Lamb's wife hath made herself ready she says I'm not going to wait till the last minute I'm going to get everything in order so that when I hear behold the bridegroom cometh that I don't have to fuss over this I caught a revelation of what is in the word amen this is not a man's Revelation this is a revelation that come from God the prophet of God laid out these little things in these cute little stories don't you just love the stories the prophet shared such as the the the armor meat Packer son and and the little wash girl you know and and he says I'm coming back for you is that sound familiar amen I'm coming back for you sounds very familiar to me my brother and sister it's a promise that he made and it will come to pass she believed it she spent her evenings sitting there sewing that gown and I don't know by Revelation she knew the day somehow something had come to her and while they they are all mocking her and they're all doing she's standing on the front porch with maybe just nothing but a little case that had the most personal of things there and she's standing on the porch and they're ridiculing her until they hear the rumble now there's no time at that point my brother and sister to run find oil there's no time at that place to say you know what give me a moment I'll sew my own wedding garment no that season's passed that season's being behind us and Satan would so subtly are any procrastinators here you know I'll just let you know just how this works there's procrastinators here yeah I had a friend once most industrious man I think I ever met in my life he said you know I used to say ah I'll do it tomorrow and his father-in-law would tell him one of these days there won't be a tomorrow and he wasn't speaking in religious terms one of these days there won't be a tomorrow you need to take care of business today and then his father-in-law got crippled and he realized this robust strong man one day poof Works no longer and that was he was actually reason Young when that took place and he said I will do today what I need to do today and he found out it wasn't any more work this is the point I want to get to you know it's no more work to do it today than it is to do it tomorrow it takes the same amount of preparation to be ready and in that Satan would love to make us procrastinate ators amen so here it is the parad shift taking place it's no longer God speaking to a church no longer just speaking something to an age but the message to this age has become a personal message to his bride now you know uh there's the little things that the prophet of God shares with us speaking about you know the love letters that would be mailed to him and and his wife would be writing in there that she had put the kids to bed she' done the laundry folded the laundry done all of these things brother Brown says I'm reading between the lines and I see that everything that she's saying there is I love you and I miss you and and he's reading that now if you and I pick up that letter and we just look at that letter it says H well I guess she had nothing better to do than to tell them she does laundry and of course they're married so you know this some of these things are going to you know be shared you know I got the kids to bed yep they're you know his kids as much as her kids and you know done this and done that but really as the prophet of God explains it to us because he gives us insight to this this is really a love story unfolding she's saying I love you and the children and love you and we miss you and we want you back and we're looking for your return and and it's all in that letter that a stranger reading it would not get and we are in this day I'm sorry to say this kind of direct where people don't think that in the message that reading between the lines was for a prophet only if it was only for a prophet he could have kept it to himself and not confuse the water but it wasn't to a prophet only it was a love letter that was sent to the church and in that love letter you and I anointed to read between those lines are realizing this is a personal message to me amen not to the bride or the church any longer Saints we're beyond that this is not about you and the message this is about you and Jesus Christ this is no longer about our church and what our church does it is between you and Jesus Christ period And when we read between those lines we start to realize I I understand I I am I am missing my Lord Jesus Christ I I want to see him I want to be closer to him and I say Lord help us amen so this message to this age has went from just a declaration of doctrines and theology I was listening a little bit to a minister I I won't even name names and uh it preach ing a phenomenal service and somebody wrote in the comments oh what a wonderful Thunders message okay if that's what you got out of it he is speaking with authority with strength you believe you got to take it back to a Doctrine that's what they were trying to do those others chimed in on it we we're re reinforcing a Doctrine we're reinforcing our thought you missed it that was a personal expression from God to you amen a personal message my brother and sister not a calling together of a great group now this is going to sound pretty crass and I hope you don't get offended by this but my brother and sister you got to take care of your own self you got to take care of your relationship you got to take care of your life and your family I can't take care of it for you it is impossible for me and it is impossible the same for you to my family this becomes personal you can't get the token in your house without you doing it the preacher can't bring the token and deposit it in your house you deposit the token in your house amen and how do you do that you start reading between the lines and realize this is Christ talking to you amen he's using another voice he might be using whatever it might be but it's God talking to you not you my brother and sister hoping that your pastor can do something for you but it's the Holy Spirit coming in set an atmosphere that the Holy Spirit speaks to your heart gives you the answers you need gives you the strength you need because this is a personal message amen if not we will become another denomination and the prophet of God said this message will not denominate if it becomes Collective we will denominate but if it's at the personal level I don't like saying it this way it sounds a little harsh I probably sound a little harsh this morning do I okay thank you but you see my brother and sister it's coming down so narrow edged right if we make it a church or group we're on the wrong side he didn't come to save the church he come to save you and he will he has Can someone say amen amen so you know a love letter means a lot more when the person it's intended for reads it yeah I I I'll just share just a little bit off to the side here you know Sister Jerry has this great big box hid out in our house it's got all these love letters and one day she'd cleaning and pulled this box out and I started thumbing through it and I I was like hope you catch the pun I was appalled how bold old I wasbe somebody dated my daughter and wrote letters like this I'd slap his head off if I knew that but you see I was wanting to convey a message to this girl that she had no doubt that I was in love with her no doubt do we have any doubts we should the letter is very strong it's very straightforward I redeemed you I've made the way for you I shed my blood for you I've forgiven you of every transgression nothing will be held against you my brother and sister he's made it so clear to us who we are it's a personal message there was a brother one time shared a little deal and he was making analogy ande preaching to a church back east and he says now any of you robbed a bank he's just thinking that's a safe analogy you know any of you robbed a bank you know you know unless you've robbed a bank none of this will apply to you and there was a brother in the church and he's like but maybe it was just for him he knew he had come to the place that his life was fully destroyed prisoned for 25 5 years everything being what it was and by the grace of God somebody asked this brother do you know what Grace is oh let me tell you what Grace is I know what Grace is well my brother and sister the word says that if we are guilty of one thing we're guilty of all of it oh we should know what Grace is that God has come and it's a personal message that whatever situation you had I had anyone had we can look at that and say it was God who come I didn't need some blanket forgiveness God come specifically to me and forgave my situation Amen brother back east Great Big Brother in prison for murder supposed to be in there for life God come on him he got a message book in the prison God come on him so strong changed him so radically my brother and sister that in the prison right there they're all stunned Something's Happened to this man and it was a few more years it didn't happen just overnight but then they put him before the parole board and they turned him loose and it was there my brother and sister nothing short even the warden said this is a miracle but we serve a God that has Miracles amen we are Miracles we are the kind of people that believe we're not looking for past but we know what it means now if if it's prophesied that in this age Christ is on the outside of the church this conversation with the bride has become a very personal one it's not broadcast to the world anymore we're still going to see Souls being saved don't don't misund understand me but you see this is slowly narrowing down because when the last soul is saved it's finished we don't need not speaking ill of this but we don't need a Billy Graham Crusade we don't need these kind of things the word of God shows us very C clearly that now is the the sifting or the you know uh uh um oh I forgot the word it was right there do you understand what I'm talking about on the wheat floor amen so another thing that just strikes me we have Eagles out there on the lake and we get to see them every once in a while some pretty almost like Supernatural things you know driving on our way to church on Sunday morning maybe about here to the back of the church an eagle flying at our ey level along with us right down the highway on the dam right there and it even looked over at us and I mean I wanted to tell him first off he like hey did you know you're going 38 miles an hour but it really struck me here it is the eagle anointing of our age it's got the power it's got the strength it's got the confidence everything we need it could easily stay perched on a limb somewhere and said I'm capable of that are you with me but it's time to get off the limb shake out the old feathers and say not only am I capable of that I am going to do that I will Fly Like an Eagle I will come to the presence of God and I will do that and you know Eagles understand Eagle language you know isn't amazing I tell you Jerry and I hope this isn't for squeamish people Jerry and I coming to church one day we could see a goose out on the ice and we came home and it looked like they were having Church all the eagles gathered around what had been a goose now how do you attract that many geese I mean uh Eagles you hear the scream and when the eagle screams the eagle understands the scream and this is the day the eagle Revelation has come and you look at you my we wouldn't even fill the front two rows of some of the church churches in these neighborhoods but their Scream was a different kind of scream what they hear is a different voice but to hear an eagle now Look What the Lord says in Isaiah 41:10 fear thou not for I am with thee be not dismayed for I am thy God I will strengthen thee yay I will help thee yay I will uphold thee with the right hand of my rightous iess have you experienced this amen I tell you God is so gracious my brother and sister he said I'm with you and don't be dismayed I'm your God and I'm going to strengthen you this this applies to us amen hallelujah let me move right along here who do you say this is I want to ask you what do you feel like today do you Feel Like an Eagle come on don't look at me this way y all look nervous well let me shock you I don't feel like an eagle right now but I know I am that's all that matters is that we know that we are equals amen you might not get up in the morning amen I woke up about 3:00 this morning with my hip hurting and I laid there in bed for a while and I finally is like I might as well just get up my brother and sister that doesn't make you feel overpowering strong Overcomer it makes you actually feel feeble hm very feeble feel strong one day and feel crippled the next but this has nothing to do with this I know I'm an eagle I know I was called of God I know that this work he began in me he will finish I know this and no matter what this flesh no matter the torment of the mind or of the body no matter the the suppression of your spirit where you just feel like have I done something wrong Lord what have I done and then you know Satan will come and say have you ever done anything right and you can't really give an answer to that but there's something down inside that you hear in this scream of the eagle that says but you are mine I claimed you I called you I provided for you it was was my blood that washed you it is my life that flows through your veins and it is me that's going to carry you through and then you put your old wings out and you say Thank You Lord thank you Lord I I will overcome I am an overcomer not that I hope to but I am Amen brother Brown says here who do you say this is God May men and women no longer hold on to traditions and creeds but may they come out of that thing and give their lives completely to God and believe not just trust upon the theory and the things of man but trust in a living God my brother and sister I just watched a little documentary thing and and these people are climbing places in the world that they said years ago were unclimbable and you know they're willing to trust I never pronounce it correctly but but they're willing to trust they will take and drive uh a pitton Paton whatever it is into a crack in a rock put their hook upon that and trust their very life to a little piece of metal carbide and how well they drove it in the crack of The Rock and we struggle to trust God tells you it's a greater battle than we've ever thought greater battle than we've ever recognized men trust their very life to those things and God having proven himself over and over again we struggle to trust him while these holidays this was preached 12 and 27 1964 while these holidays are going on this the cry still is who is this what is it what's it all about religious people say the same thing and it's the same Lord Jesus made flesh in his people according anointing his word for the bride God making himself flesh in you and I I want to ask you are you really you come on are you really you are we not getting it if you're the bride of Christ you're not really you one flesh right our marriage vows reflect that one flesh you're not really you you're Christ here in this testing ground the prophet of God said let it come down to prove who you are and he is he is proving we are not flesh we are not this we have attributes of it amen come on I won't go I get too caught up in examples sometimes I'm sorry but it's no longer see it's the same Lord Jesus made flesh in his people anointing his word for the bride and they can't understand it they're also tore away in leoda till they don't know what it's all about I want to ask you is this about a better career is this about a better house a newer car is this about a better clothes is this about you know I mean these are all segments of it don't don't misunderstand me it's not just about finding the right person to marry them that's important but without Christ in the equation what have we got you can meet the nicest person on Earth but without Christ amen we can have the best job on Earth but without Christ amen if you don't think so just look at the world we're living in today my brother sister is people are wealthier at the top end of the scale wealthier than ever and crazier than ever I'll just leave it that simple amen people in their 60s you know like sister Jerry and I building 10,000 square foot houses for two people to live in insanity and I I could go on and on but I'm going to try and hurry here they can't understand it they're so tore away and Leo to seea till they don't know what it's all about and the prophet said there'll be light in the evening so where are we looking for it Lord come Lord bless each one amen you see it all depends on where we're looking hallelujah what are we looking for Saints our Focus every day should be Lord I want to come a little closer to you I I want to do something for you Lord I I want to stand here Lord knowing that you are in me I want to reflect that amen you see when Christ was outside the church the church got to interpret the word in the way that pleased them but we're here you see they created their own narrative now I doubt if you guys followed that much and I I wouldn't expect you to but you're seeing now in the denominations this whole uh alternate lifestyle we'll keep it politically correct alternate lifestyle stuff you see one by one it is fracturing the denominational churches they will stand I just watched a whole deal was a meeting uh amongst methodists and um and they're standing there on one side of the aisle you might say is saying but the Bible says and people on the other side of the aisle but we have to be relevant in other words we don't need the word we need relevance and then you're seeing Oh the C clergy should at least be well the clergy is no different than us and when they're all done they're now an inclusive church and the Bible put on the Shelf I hope our bibles are not on a shelf I hope our bibles are dust free I hope you wear out your Bible I'll buy you another one you see but the minute Christ got put outside the door was opened and the demons flooded in in if we're not careful we focus on that but the truth of it is it's lip to ear Jesus Christ speaking to you today personally now this might not be the most exciting message my brother and sister but I have to just share with you you won't get to blame me you won't get to blame the preacher across the country you won't get to blame the visiting preacher preachers we won't get to blame brother Chris or Brother David you see this is a personal thing and you should be excited about it being personal because God's not offering it to you second-handed he's offering it to you personal amen you know when Jerry and I were courting many years ago um there was young lady's a good friend of sister Jerry's known her I think all her life practically and um you know she was she was a great encourager of the whole thing you know instigator might be a better word but you see the problems that Jerry and I have today I cannot go back and say Janette it's your fault well there might be some Merit to that you see it's what we have done with it it's what we've applied what we've fed what we've brought to fruition I think it's time Saints the actions in our marriages in our children in our church that we have the courage to stand up and take full accountability for that brother Alex would you come I just want you all to leave so happy amen are we ready to take accountability for that brother Brandon preaches several time through the message you know about trying to get warmed by a painted fire I don't want a painted fire I want the real fire I want to be able to stand in say it hurt it hurt like you can't believe to bring my life subject to the word that I'm so glad I did because now the holy spirit that fire is down inside changing my life changing my family changing my marriage changing my children changing everything around me changing and that brought to church and changed our church you see it's a personal personal [Music] message do you personally want to change you personally want the Holy Spirit to come down take a Hal of Our Lives take bitterness and anger stubbornness all the little besetting sins do we we want him to come and just so personally deal with us that we could finally come to a stage of our life we didn't offer an excuse we offered a complete surrender forgive me Lord forgive me I want to change I want to be what your word says I am I want to live the life you promised me I want to be a change in my church amen you might find it awkward if someone says I am going to change Grace Tabernacle you might become leery of someone a preacher I'm going to change Grace Tabernacle and you think now what is he going to do but if you understood that he was looking for God to change him and he knew when God changed him it would change this [Music] church are we willing to go that far claim it as our own personal message not just something brother brandom spoke to a bunch of people we believe it we identify with it but to actually take ownership of this message not as something we follow not something that we believe in but actually taking ownership of this message if the word says it he would create a clean heart in us then we should be saying I have a clean heart amen he says if he would deliver me from all of my afflictions then we should be sent here today saying I'm free but we have to make a personal claim he was preaching to me amen I don't say this to bring humor but it's pretty easy have you guys ever practice Pitchfork religion you know the preachers preaching and you know that's pretty straightforward that probably needs to go over there oh not here that goes over here how about we just stand up and say Lord I want to take accountability to that that's for me that's for Me Maybe if it's just the smallest degree that's for me the prophet said I'll say Amen to that we want to follow the message right amen we ought to say Amen to the hard things as much as we say Amen to the things that we love personal message God tailored it just for you not to punish you Saints I'm not here speaking this morning to punish anyone I'm here this morning speaking that when we take person personal accountability that this is my message God sent a prophet just for me guaranteeing me to make the Rapture amen that's not selfish that's an understanding of what God and the value he placed upon you that he would send a prophet just for me amen hallelujah amen let's stand God bless [Music] you little homework anybody good for [Music] homework amen go look up scripturally and what prophet of God said about serving God being a burden do you know in the Old Testament God said if you say I'm a burden I'll cast you out I'll throw you out I will leave you and we act like sometimes man sermon God such a burden it's a privilege Saints it's not a burden it's a privilege anyway who wants to get to heaven and be despised by those soldiers that are battle scarred and here you are and your starched white dressed so perfect not a mark anywhere they would look at you and say you cannot be from the same gospel that we were from you know you guys have been hidden out and snuck on the bus amen this is a battle Saints this is for warriors this is for people with courage this is for people that are not going to give up no matter what happens in this life amen that's what this is for and it's a personal message God gave to you because he knew you would receive it [Music] amen reminds me a brother one time says now has God forced any of you to serve him and out in the congregation was a few people it's like okay your pastor needs to go back and start again and preach some of this God never forced us he saw before the foundation of the world that we would say Amen to the word hallelujah hallelujah 368 Hallelujah brother Chris if you'll come above all [Music] power above all Kings all nature and all cre name above

out of line I was standing there and and I was looking out and I realized I had I had dreamed that some years ago and I think we should lay hands on each other and have a order of prayer that God would Cal down in our church in a greater way than he ever has before brother to brother sister to sister amen let's pray Heavenly Father Lord Jesus Lord we know you are the god that created
