I see for when your eyes are on this child Your Grace abounds in [Music] me oh Lord please light the fire that once burned bright and clean renew the Lamb of my first [Music] with holy you know it's so wonderful that our lord loves us so much even in the struggles of Life he's here keeps relighting the fire and just keeps encouraging keeps strengthening keeps revealing himself more and more to us and uh I think it's just such a wonderful thing because we're human and sometimes in just the whole labor of life we just kind of like the fire you're you're out there in the evening time and if somebody doesn't throw wood on the fire eventually it goes out and the Lord just comes and keeps just adding adding and adding and adding encouraging strengthening us and I say it's a a wonderful thing amen uh before we proceed into our thought tonight I would just ask you to please remember Sister Dorcas I just had some interaction with her and she has just been in so much pain that um it's just been very discouraging to her so please pray for her uh for her family uh and uh uh sister Rebecca is thankful for the Bible that you bought her as a graduation gift and uh I'll just be bold to say I pray she reads it I pray that it speaks to her heart and and uh we live in troubled times but we don't have to be troubled amen we can stand with confidence on the word for the hour that we live in amen and you know I I just have to say I started this thought uh and uh somehow or another I've ended up going entirely a different direction so I I I um I I just pray that uh it will speak to your heart will be something that would be encouraging and uh I just want to say thank you to our musicians the song service was lovely spoke to my heart and uh I'm thankful to the Lord for uh the desire of our musicians to to um uh help us in our worship uh brother Alex leading in songs and amen I want to speak to you tonight very simple title as it were uh our progress and um uh I put as a note below that um Satan doesn't like you and um that that shouldn't come as any surprise to us but you know the reason kind of a little bit why I it's along this tile is when you start studying a certain vein a certain thought you realize just how much God is doing for us you just realize uh the keeping power the encouraging power the strength that he is pouring into us and uh you know I don't know if you pay attention to the politics but they're throwing the word weird around and I I'm here to join them on that because Satan thinks you're weird amen he he he doesn't understand why that you are not interested in what the rest of the world is interested in he he's he doesn't understand why you don't find pleasure in the very finest of Pleasures that he has offered in this day and H he doesn't understand why that uh in a time when it's easier to just go with the flow that you are pressing against it amen and and uh so because of that he just simply doesn't like you if we'll turn in our Bibles uh in Exodus the 14th chapter we're going to just draw a little bit out of it quite lengthy scripture but I hope you don't mind uh us reading uh the uh uh from verse 1 to verse 15 we'll try to be concise good to see you brother Chris you travels amen and the Lord spake to Moses saying Speak unto the children of Israel that they turn and encamp before my I cannot pronounce these words I don't even know where to start uh p heroth and mcdull and the Sea over against ba zon where it shall ye encamp by the Sea for Pharaoh will say now this is like prophecy God is making a declaration to Moses this what Pharaoh is going to say my I tell you what my brother and sister we're living in a day that God's made some declarations that that the devil's going to say this but that doesn't mean that's what's going to happen amen isn't he often times voiced his deal you you have this issue you have this these problems finances whatever it might be discouragements Etc and he speaks those as though they're fact but God's already speaking the word saying this is what Satan's going to say this is what Satan's thinking this is what Satan's going to do and it really doesn't matter what Satan's original plan was amen and uh for fedro will say to the CH uh of the children of Israel they are entangled in the land the Wilderness hath shut them in and I will harden Pharaoh's heart that he shall follow after them and I will be honored upon pharaoh and upon all his host that the Egyptians may know that I am the Lord and they did so and it was told the king of Egypt that the people fled in the heart of fedro and his servants was turned against the people and they said why have we done this that we have let Israel go from serving us now I want you to think about and bring all of this into this day right now you see Satan is not happy that you have turned from serving him he is sitting there very very upset that that you have chosen to as it were flee his kingdom and not follow him and we see this in in Pharaoh because he he thought he had these people a servitude he let them this Liberty of having children building families falling in love all of these kind of things it would be a permanent slave Supply amen does this not fit the day we live in like a permanent slave Supply and he made ready his Chariot and took his people with him and he took 600 chosen chariots and all the Chariots of Egypt and captains over every one of them and the Lord hardened the heart of pharoh king of Egypt and he pursued after the children of Israel and the children of Israel went out with a high hand but the Egyptians pursued after them now I want you to remember the high hand okay but the Egyptians pursued after them all the horses and Chariots of pharaoh and his Horsemen and his army and overtook them encamping by the Sea beside and I'll pronounce this different than I did before forgive me pero before ba zavon and when Pharaoh Drew nigh the children of Israel lifted up their eyes and behold the Egyptians marched after them and they were sore afraid and the children of Israel Cried Out unto the Lord and they said unto Moses now do you catch that they're crying out unto the Lord but they said unto Moses now remember these people are the same ones that have cried for 400 years for deliverance because there were no graves in Egypt hast thou taken us away to die in the wilderness wherefore hast thou dealt thus with us to carry us forth out of Egypt is not this the the word that we did tell thee in Egypt let us alone come on are you with me on one hand Lord we need Deliverance let not another generation let not our children become bondage to Le oysa but preacher You Preach too hard you're too strict you should just leave us alone you see the Paradox of it all it's Humanity that we did tell thee in Egypt saying let us alone that we may serve the Egyptians for it had been better for us to serve the Egyptians than that we should die in the wilderness and Moses said unto the people fear ye not stand still and see the salvation of the Lord which he will show you today for the Egyptians whom you have seen seen today ye shall see them again no more forever the Lord shall fight for you and ye shall hold your peace and the Lord said unto Moses wherefore CEST thou unto me speak unto the children of Israel that they go forward Heavenly Father we thank you for your word Lord bless the Saints tonight father each and those Lord that were unable to come those that are here father we just ask you to speak to each and every heart in the name of Jesus Christ Christ amen you may be seated I always found this scripture to be such an example of the Paradox of humanity that uh they cry for deliverance but don't like the way that God delivers them amen now this is a time of The Exodus and you know I think when we look at this we can look at it really uh uh uh and I hope tonight that we don't just look at his history but look at it today uh you know looking for a trouble-free experience and and um I I think that Lord understands that I think many of us when we got saved kind of felt like you know hey we've gave our life to the lord it's going to just be easy now and are perplexed a little bit when it becomes very difficult but here is Israel just looking for a trouble-free experience no obstacles but what they don't realize is God was not just putting them in this time time just for them but also for an example uh Through the Ages and I think very much uh example to the day we live in as we are now in our Exodus amen we're coming to a very very close we're seeing lots of things come uh brother vasile just shared a little something with me and I didn't get to listen to all of it because of time but my brother and sister the signs are before us the signs are in the heavens and it's not just us the bride of Christ or Believers of the message that are seeing these signs but the world is seeing these signs and and by God's grace it's being put together for us we we don't have to try and search how to tie the loose ends together but God has given the message to come and bring these loose ends for us but we're seeing the signs in the heavens we're seeing signs in the earth and these things are all speaking uh of a fulfilled scripture prophecy that has come to pass is coming to pass and entirety and so it's there you know if we're thinking that Christian walk is going to be a time of no obstacles then we we are mistaken because even in this day we have to face our own Red Sea amen and and uh I I just want to just go over for just a moment my brother and sister and then we'll return back into our thought but you realize that what God's expectation was at the Red Sea is that Israel would look at the promise and the promise says uh that we would be delivered and the promise says that we go forth we're going back to the promised land but what happened when Israel got there that day to the Red Sea it looked like an insurmountable obstacle before them it looked like something too great for them to deal with and in that part their hearts turned to stone they they become paralyzed and they looked at that and they said there's no way that we can cross this but little did they know my brother and sister that God had already provided the way for them to cross what he was looking for was a people that would actually just keep on walking they would say the promise matters more than my thinking my emotion my feelings of all of this and and how can it be what how can we accomplish this and you might look in this day right now and and I I have conversation with people and they're afraid for their children now I'm not speaking down on that but my brother and sister it should not be a fear that we have for our children we can be as it were a little bit concerned but uh the Lord said that I have not lost a one and our children fall right into that category we don't have to look at this and say you know what leod deia is going to get our children leod deia is going to this Le is going to that my brother and sister that's not what the promise is the promise is that he has given us our children and they shall as seed of God not go in on Mom and Dad's coattail but they will go in in Revelation of their own experience of who they are in Jesus Christ and so it's there as we Face our own Red Sea pretty perplexing is it not to come face to face whether it might be a health issue it might be a family issue it might be a financial issue it might be an emotion issue whatever it might be my brother and sister but it could be a red to you now the problem that happened with Israel is when they come up to the Red Sea and saw something that was in no way in their ability to overcome there there was no trees to make rafts or boats uh there was no go up a few miles to a bridge or go to here to escape but basically they were hemmed in and and we'll touch on that in just a little bit but they're hemmed in and what God really expected of them was to stand there and say this is an obstacle and God told us we're going to the promised land let's continue in this journey but they become paralyzed and they stood on the shore and as they're standing on the shore all kinds of things start to creep in every time Sons and Daughters of God Believers quit going forward we become paralyzed and when we become paralyzed faith is then locked up and is not able to act amen now it was the experience at the Red Sea my brother and sister did not put this doubt fear and anxiety in the people it actually was already there the Red Sea just revealed it and as we are here in this day and obstacles come in our life we find ourselves speaking things of doubt and fear and anxiety our own self I want you to realize as the bride of Christ God's bringing you into those positions to expose those things that are not of him that is in this flesh he's looking to expose our weakness not to humiliate us not to uh put us down not to uh bring us to a place of judgment and Discord but my brother and sister he's coming there part of the Refiner's Fire is showing there are certain things that we must deal with amen and so this experience they had at the Red Sea amen not the only time and we could go through many more through scripture but we'll just uh tie these two together they had the same experience in the wilderness of sin that's in Exodus 16:3 you'll find that see it was uh revealed my brother and sister that it was there it showed them what was happening and you know for some they never got over it they never ever outgrew the fear and anxiety their view of what God was supposed to do for them uh was was uh co-mingled with their ideas and actually a lack of faith or Revelation they are there thinking this God's going to make this just a a few days we're going to be in the promised land and because God was going to take the fear anxiety and unbelief out of them now I want you to think about the fact it took 40 years that's a lot of labor on God's part to finally root out fear anxiety unbelief from Israel something that one good Revival now let me put it this way one good Revival meeting and one trip to the altar saying Lord forgive me could have dealt with that instead it took 40 years to break through the nature of Israel they had so long been in their tradition so long in their ideas of who God was that it took a long time for God to get this out of them and so it's there this Wilderness of sin we'll see many times for sake you you know the scripture but through the Wilderness of sin God allowed them to be thirsty allowed them to be hungry he allowed a lot of things to come serpents and all kinds of things to come trying to get the people to finally exercise their faith and I pray my brother and sister my original title uh was going to be on what is hindering us amen but I I something encouraged me take the positive route here because we are making progress Can someone say Amen on that amen we are making progress we are not where we were even a year ago maybe not even six months ago we are making progress in Sons and Daughters of God Amen so it was revealed what was in them and at that place my brother and sister I would have to say what is being revealed in us can we just stop for a moment tonight and just think about it what is is being revealed in us I believe I'm talking to the salt of the earth real sons and daughters of God Holy Ghost filled Christians with a desire and I say Lord let be revealed in us as David said in Psalms 51 created in me a clean heart oh God renew a right Spirit within me it tied it resonated brother Alex the song that you sung tonight amen cuz we my brother and sister are coming to the place it's not a matter of what I did I I I I I might have done wrong but I know how to correct it and I do amen I might have come short but I know by Revelation what God expects and how to get me to the place I need to be I don't throw my hands up you don't throw your hands up we don't say God you're asking too much of us but we stand here in a position saying yes I may have come short today but Lord I'm going to rise up in the morning morning you're going to renew my spirit in the morning and I'm going to press forward in this battle and Lord you are going to create in me a clean heart and you are going to renew you're going to relight the fire that is in me amen I tell you I I don't know maybe I'm out of line to just admit this but I tell you the Lord relights the fire quite a bit amen there's times that that you just the struggle of life just burns it right down to nothing and we think that the fire is going to go out and Satan is here to tell you good old Pharaoh he's here to tell you you're trapped but you're not because God comes and relights The Fire And We rise up again with something burning in our soul and we say Lord forgive me for my failure but Lord I'm going to press to that Mark and I'm going to keep pressing to that Mark and every time the Fire gets dim God is there to pour more oil in amen and relight the fire now what happened with Israel and what is happening in the very day that we live in is people are actually Israel become spiritually paralyzed on one hand they had 400 years of cries to the Lord for deliverance and God comes to deliver it instead of it being a Revival that brought forth life now my brother and sister these are a people that believed enough to put Blood on the lentil but not enough come on let me can I belabor that for just a minute I'll I'll it end up taking a little longer it would take Faith to believe the blood of a lamb placed on the lentil of your door with a common weed of Egypt would be enough to keep a death angel from visiting your house that took faith amen but they didn't have enough Faith to step out in the water that little journey some Dynamic why oh pardon me because it would be kind of silly in the thought but no line of greyhounds pulled up and they got on and in a few hours they were in the promised land they got hot they got tired now the word says their shoes their clothes never wore out but it didn't say anything about their feet hurting they become spiritually Paralyzed by the time they had made that short Journey to the Red Sea they actually become spiritually paralyzed now my brother and sister the word of God has come in our day and In God's Time piece it's been a very short time that this renewed word as it were restored word is the word I mean to use has been here very short time and in that short time look where it t has taken us from the absolute undeniable Supernatural to we're not even sure if this is true or not this is the effect that happened on Israel as they were leaving Egypt God coming this day and said I promis to restore the word and deliver you back to your rightful position a spirit promised land for the bride of Christ and in my brother and sister I don't know I didn't do the math I'm going to call it 75 years it's winter we don't even know if this is true or not you see it's no different my brother and sister there was great revivals starting back in the day there was great revivals people crying out they wanted a move of God and God come on this scene and has delivered them and then the years have went by this journey has come and they have met obstacle after obstacle it wasn't just simply the Rapture will be tomorrow and praise God we were able to believe for a week or two or a month or a year but God is now going on and the people are starting to question this and they're coming against obstacles and they say now look I'm just going to speak blunt there are those people right now at this very moment stumbling because some someone said brother brandham said that Billy Paul would be a young man and Billy Paul's gone I'm not going to interpret what if that was ever said it's not for me to interpret I didn't hear it I don't know but what I do know is God said I'm going to deliver you into a promised land and I'm going to keep walking and I'm going to keep believing can we believe that amen that it doesn't matter what these other peripheral real things are it doesn't matter what was spoke here or what was done there what matters is is whether we are going to keep walking and believing the word for this hour and as we stand on that word my brother and sister God had a plan and we'll get into this thought here in a minute God had a plan he's got a plan for each and every individual and because I brought up brother Billy Paul I say God had a plan for brother Billy Paul he's got a plan for you and I my brother and sister but the plan for you is not necessarily hinged upon me it's hinged upon our belief of the word it's hinged whether we're going to keep walking or will we become spiritually paralyzed amen and what happens is is this spiritual uh uh paralyzation uh uh people lose their vision of it and and what happens at that time there's no more spiritual growth and you know as well as I do that we cannot live on a past experience dealing with a man one time in the struggles that he was having I asked him when's the last time you read your Bible it had been several years past my brother and sister spiritually paralyzed there there was there was something there he just couldn't overcome he just couldn't couldn't bring himself to to to engage in and then there's no more spiritual growth and when there's no more spiritual growth the confession changes I'm telling you there's something about the word that speaks to the heart that causes you and I to have stimulation that comes forward amen the Revelation comes forward and it stirs our heart and we remember and it causes us to dig in but if you come to a place of being spiritually paralyzed amen there is no growth the confession changes and just like Israel at the Red Sea doubt fear anger impatience starts to be manifested and I tell you Satan's working the same plan today he's right here today we are in this Exodus Journey we are in the wilderness of sin we are here in a time that Satan would love to wear you down amen does anybody feel tired tonight amen I think about half the hands probably go up or maybe all of them would go up tonight amen Satan wants to wear you down because he's recognized there's a condition between the flesh man and the spiritual man he recognizes that if he can afflict us in one form it will impact the other and it's there that is coming Satan working this same plan today Pharaoh's plan failed you know why he didn't account for God's plan Satan had his plan and Pharaoh had his plan not accounting for God's plan looking at that amen and so as is Satan's failing today because he is not accounting for God's plan and the reason he's not accounting for God's plan is while he can read the word just as well if not better than you do he does not know God's individual plan for every life amen we're seeing different people and not to emphasize on this but we're seeing people that walked away years ago that they were in drugs they were in alcohol their lives are a mess and they have come back and repented and come back before the Lord and ask for forgiveness and are doing their very best day by day to serve him that certainly wasn't in Satan's plan but it was God's plan God knew that they would take that Journey he knew what kind of Red Sea and Wilderness of sin they would face know what kind of serpent that they would encounter in the wilderness and and God said I've got a plan already in place and it will not be hindered amen now brother Bram says here in the seed shall not be air with the shuck and both of these scriptures are out of 1965 and I I try not to make uh tremendous emphasis on dates but my brother and sister I believe there was a special anointing on the prophet's ministry as it come down you see at this point this date right here April the 29th I believe b stands for breakfast brother brandham didn't know he was going very shortly going off the scene God knew God knew the plan God had it all in order Amen brother Bram says here and Seed shall not be air with the shock so many times people sympathize oh and I read a book not long ago on the silent God give by some of these modern philosophers who try to turn you away from God if you don't know the word of God did you catch that if you don't know the word and the plan of God you can be easily shook but when you see God's plan his program then by faith you know it's God God identifying himself doing just what he did in other times walking and proving amen I want to know has God proven his plan to you amen over and over again right not just once looking back 20 years ago well that's a little far for some of you but whatever the space would be not us looking back in history let me put it that way oh God proved himself once to me we serve a God who proves himself every single day he's proving himself his majesty his power everything my brother and sister every every single day if we're cognizant if we're watching if we're listening amen that's the reason Moses could not be shook aren't you glad Moses wasn't shook amen CU if he'd have been shook imagine what the whole program would have done amen I'm glad the prophet couldn't be shook he had his ups and downs isn't that so beautiful I don't know about you but I'm really happy when the prophet tells us about his flaws the world out here that's as a reason not to follow him I tell you that's a reason to follow him because I have so far in this life well today started off reasonably well I know you guys think like this you know today is going to be one of those Flawless days today is going to be a day that I'm going to think every thought correct I'm going to every action is going to be perfect I'm going to be just a shining example right I didn't get a very enthusiastic response out of that no sir we're human we got up this morning amen first thing out of bed I stubbed my toe that's the way to start your day amen look my brother and sister God was there we didn't have have to be perfect he's perfect we have to be in his plan we have to desire to be in God's perfect will but if we were capable of being in his perfect will all the time God would never have given permissive will but we should not spend our time trying to live in permissive will we should be focused on perfect will and say Lord you know my heart that's where I want to be I might be living in the moment right here but right there is where I want to be and that's where I'm going to stri and labor and push and press to the mark of being in the perfect will of God not just a halfhazard life amen that's the reason Moses could not be shook he talked face to face with God and God told him I am the one that was with Abraham back Yonder I'm the one that's made this promise I'll be with you how are you going to stop a man then that man then how are you going to stop that man that said how how's how's the devil going to stop you guys tonight when you're sitting here knowing that God called you before the foundation of the world and you confess that you don't just throw it out halfhazard but you believe it can someone lift your hand and say I believe that then I was in Christ before the foundation of the world and how can Satan come and then Rob or stop you from that right there you hold on to that and you know that you was in Christ and he's in you now amen the devil might trip you might stumble you I know none of you ever say things or act out in ways that you're embarrassed about but my brother and sister when you do do that you can stand and say you know what I have an advocate I've got a lawyer he's the best lawyer ever amen there's not a lawyer on the earth an advocate on the earth that meets my Advocate that can defeat my Advocate because he was perfect in the beginning and he's perfect now amen and there's our confidence that we can stand amen we don't have to come and hope it's no longer a time for we as Believers to sit here and hope that we make a Rapture it's time for us to bring our confession and say I'm Rapture material already being manifested this body is already being changed into the very image of Christ what he called me to be I am being molded into that and sometimes it takes adversity I figured I'd hear an amen sometimes it takes adversity but we don't like adversity I'm not sure I can even spell adversity amen how you going to stop that man then as the prophet of old said when the lion Ro who can but fear and God has spoken who can but prophesy when we see the things that God promised at this hour the prophet wasn't speaking back into history he was talking this hour I say tonight Saints let's not talk back into history our own self but this hour right here right now what God is doing what he has promised to you and I amen don't let's not look back into that now I'm not saying that we don't look back I believe we study the message we study scripture we study history but we don't live on a vision from Days Gone By we're living in a very present tense Vision where God is showing a people what it is going to be and what it is right now and what it's going to be as a bride of Christ in this day brother bradam says that we've moved out of leoda now my brother and sister we have to be careful when we take those things to really put it in the correct order so we don't frame it incorrect ourself amen this is a spirit of Le to see you out here but the bride is moved into a realm of another spirit amen now we could simplify that and say the bride has the Holy Ghost but you'll see my brother and sister the impact of the Bride being filled with the Holy Ghost puts her in a whole different world out here amen I I'm not here to judge anyone of what they do but you'll find as time goes on the things you liked you like less and less and the things you desire grow greater and greater and greater and that's the effect of the word on you in this day not talking about what happened back in the denominational days of Pentecost some really good things some really incredible things as a child I got to witness some of those things but my brother and sister I can't go back and live in Pentecost I can't go live in that day we're living in a day that God's revealed the word to the bride and so you can call it if you want that's the way the prophet puts it it's the bride age it's a Time the bride is coming into this maturity because she's not looking back she's took the promise that God gave and she's now turned and looked to the Fulfillment of that promise she didn't look at the Red Sea she didn't look at the Wilderness of sin the serpent the no water being hungry she didn't look at all of that stuff she looked and said there's a promise and that promise was given to me amen and to my children and those that are a far off and we believe that and we're not going to be sidetracked because we had an obstacle when you see the things that God has promised at this hour see it unfold how can you stand still when you see that his way what he said it would happen see all the mysterious things that's just exactly the way God said it would take place we're seeing my brother and sister now you now people would say you can add all these things together if you want but that's fine I'm not putting such an emphasis on anyone but there's down in California go do your research areas there the scientists are saying wow this piece of real estate is sliding towards the ocean just natural event people are worried about their insurance they worried about their homes crumbling they're worried about their life Investments they're they're they're not looking at coming of Christ they're not looking at word fulfilled they're looking at the fact that from the street to their driveway is now over 12et and slowly separating they're looking at life being disrupted they're looking at cares of Life they're they're looking at all of these things like this nature they're not tying it together my brother and sister but God's got some people that are looking at the whole picture and realizing God is fulfilling his word it is coming to pass right as we speak today amen now we look at this my brother and sister uh this Revelation now all not all Revelation is is deep spiritual things my brother sister the prophet of God saying California is going to slide in the ocean you realize he was sharing a revelation he was sharing what a Time piece would reveal when he was speaking of these things my brother and sister science was still saying oh we have some earthquakes and we have this and we have these situations but you know now I don't spend a lot of time looking at this but I do spend a little time here and there my brother and sister you just go study all of the the um uh people that study the Earth geologists all of that and every one of them agrees there's coming a big one there's coming a big one and when it does it's going to displace land mass like we've never experienced well good that's on one side over here prophet of God says that you won't be here does that make any of you happy amen you know you don't have to you know go through that experience that now if God's going to fulfill it in Earth will he not fulfill it in the heavens there's a great war that is coming they believe that it it is just no way around it taking place in the Middle East uh uh all of these things I don't want to get into all this geopolitical stuff but but China is rumbling and saying you know we we think America that we could take you the prophet of God says those bombs are hanging in the hangers just waiting how long do they wait but even greater than that lest we would get so consumed and be afraid is the fact that the revelation of the fact that judgment doesn't strike this Earth until the bride the wife is in the house amen isn't that amazing look at the progress we're making my brother and sister we're no longer out on the porch hoping we're going to be the Bride of Jesus Christ the word is common dealing with the heart speaking to us causing us to change I I don't want to embarrass anybody so I'll let you just answer it to yourself have we changed are we still changing God is pulling us my brother and sister into his presence and it's not a force that's causing it to do it but he's wooing us like a lover like a a you know one that's moving forward into a relationship they don't force that to happen but they bring it in such a way that there's a desire to enter into that and God is speaking to you and I through this because this revelation of who Jesus Christ is now I'm going to speak a little direct I hope you don't mind but my brother and sister when you see this day people in the message make an argument that God's off the Judgment seat if he's in your heart where does this come from I'll tell you what it does it becomes a Red Sea where people spiritually don't go any further forward because they don't know how to back bence that if Christ is in me that means he's off The Mercy Seat but yet the quotes are right there in front of him and you'll see just as it been through the ages that one will see amen and one will not see amen Cain and Abel and we can go right on down through the scripture that one sees one has Revelation one cannot but the prophet of God over and over again and church I hope you believe this the prophet said that the mercy seat is in the heart heart of the believer amen it's not out here somewhere it's not out in the Revelation in the denomination world but it's in the heart of the believer and the heart is being reunited or tied together with Christ closer every single day can we say Amen to that every day we're being drawn closer into his presence amen this Revelation is unfolding before our eyes now in the God of this evil age amen and notice Cain he didn't want no blood sacrifice you know that's messy I always found it entertaining the people that will eat it after you kill it but they could never bring themselves to kill it themselves there ought to be a law against somebody that' eat a steak but they'd be unwilling to create or so to speak make that themselves that was just personal please don't he didn't want no blood sacrifice he come down and offered the fruit the fields of beauty upon his altar very religious done everything that just exactly abble done offered a sacrifice fell down before God In Worship obedient in every way but without the revelation of the word my brother and sister everything without Revelation this why the prophet of God it says you should pray for Revelation it's that important pray and I won't ask you to lift your hands but I I pray that you're praying for Revelation because it's Revelation that brings this alive to us and it doesn't become history that wasn't too offensive was it and the Word was from the beginning God's plan well brother Paul how do I know God's plan for my life it's right here you know really before you ever ask the preacher for advice or your friends for advice you should ask him for advice because he has already given the advice that we need amen and sometimes well I tell you what I maybe you've experienced this I've had issues before church issues not Paul issues Church issues and I'm like Lord what do I do what do I do what do I do and I fret and I finally finally got down and just like Lord what do I do started praying Lord I need an answer from you and I opened my Bible there's the answer yeah that's the kind of God we serve amen amen aners already on the way Amen in fact it's been here a long time and the Word was from the beginning God's plan but God revealed by Revelation the very thing that he Vindicated punctuated that that was right not religion not an altar not belonging to church not making a sacrifice not being sincere but by the revelation of the word of God God revealing to him what that it and quote goes on you have the reference you can go ahead and read it amen you see my brother and sister we could take this my I'm going to sound just really negative but I don't mean it that way we can be quite religious in the message quite religious and there's a lot of emphasis in a lot of church and I don't speak ill of that but their altars fill up every service and I know a young lady she's not so young anymore she's never got married because she hasn't found a young man that will attend her church because she believes her church is the one that's going to get the bride in the Rapture so maybe it was best that some young man I I'll I'll just stop right there and I could share with you a little story but but I'll keep it very vague of a couple used to be very very very dear to Jerry and I they threw their whole life into every activity that their Church did now some of you ought to try that but they just poured themselves out poured themselves out and when that all come apart that was really what they were serving not God they were serving their Church thinking that that in and of itself was serving God but the prophet says you know that's not the answer and um I hope you all don't mind but I know a whole bunch of people that are way more sincere than you are did that cut very deep don't want it to cut deep right I can back it up with a quote right prophet of God talks about there'll be people more sincere than you so sincerity in itself is not going to get us there and this sounds really really I had a man tell me once you're arrogant I'm sorry word of God says it's Revelation and we believe because God has given us Revelation so everything that we would look at amen so it's there that a religion if if you call it that I'm going to just type it to be leaving the message amen it's by Revelation where the altar is prophet of God laid it out very clearly it's in the heart he called this what an old Baptist tradition I think we ought to use it a little more than we do but but I'm not emphasizing that and the church being our identity my brother and sister we belong to that church amen his church is a revelation of what the church really is it's a body of Believers and making sacrifices well I tell you Lord help every one of us to be more sincere and to make more of a sacrifice to serve can somebody agree with me there amen and being more I want to be more sincere I ask the Lord Lord I want to be more sincere help me Lord be more sincere but I tell you what the prophet of God never said pray for your religion pray for your altar pray for your church as far as belonging to one uh pray about your sacrifice and pray about your sincerity but he did say pray for Revelation he said ask God to reveal the word to you all the rest of this remember right on the heels of this prophet of God says Satan can impersonate everything but your church nope he can impersonate that sincerity he can impersonate sincerity amen he can impersonate all of these things my brother and sister but he cannot brother Brown expresses it in several different ways but he cannot express true love he can express love with a carnal interpretation but not true love Jesus said if you love me go to church is that what he said he said if you love me do my Commandments so real love brings us right back to the word amen that's the day now look at the progress that is coming there was a time we didn't understand the word there's times we didn't understand a lot of things but now the time has come we as a bride are coming into maturity we are starting to see ourselves in the word don't you don't you just love that when you look at that and you start to see yourself in the word oh oh my brother and sister I tell you it just stirs my heart what a contrast God is giving in this day amen and you know it's interesting because the farther we go down this journey the more it seems like it was Israel coming from Egypt we see all these signs we see people you know my brother and sister when the Brazen serpent was placed before the people do you realize that anyone who died from that day forth died of their own accord because all they had to do is look at the Brazen Serpent and they still died there were people that refused to receive their own Deliverance hard to Fathom in this hour right now there's people refusing to receive their Deliverance because they put their emphasis on something else they won't look at Christ their deliverer they won't look upon him they won't surrender to him now remember when the Brazen serpent was there there were many who looked upon it with unbelief in their heart and the Brazen serpent did not protect them from the serpent because they did not believe h i could get off on another tangent excuse me so what are we doing Exodus 14 and three Pharaoh said to children of Israel they are entangled in the land the Wilderness has shut them in this is how Satan is looking at it today get the people entangled get them overwhelmed get them preoccupied get all of this put in place we because when the people become entangled their priority of serving God declines and I don't want to embarrass anybody and I'll tell you the busier I get the less I give hate to put myself out as example I would have rather used one of you but um it's the truth Satan knows if he can get us all entangled that then we have only so much strength so much ability so much and I don't know about you is it okay to be transparent you won't be shopping for another Pastor because yours must be backslid because he said what he said but I tell you there's times in our life we get so focused on the natural that the spiritual just Fades back and I'm probably the only one here tonight that can actually get so in Tangled I forget to read my Bible That's what Satan wants that's what he desires get him entangled get him overwhelmed get him preoccupied but I tell you my brother and sister and in spite of every flaw that we would admit tonight amen Satan did not account for God God and once again the Lord ordained that song To Be Sung amen relight the Fire Lord come relight the Fire Lord amen I love you I adore you I'm serving you I want to serve you even greater Lord but sometimes the fire just gets real low Lord just come and relight that fire light the fire in me once again it is not us being backslid my brother and sister but it is there Us in the battle and God comes and says you know what I'm going to light that fire again and I'll relight it as many times it takes to get you to the place you need to be amen you know what happens in God's plan for us Satan's trying to to get you to turn back has any of you ever been tormented with a spirit that says just quit Hard One to admit in public is it not a hard one you know especially when you got friends that turn and walk away and they're telling you a thousand one reasons why you should walk away and how much better life is without H yeah I finally got smart and learned how to block them or somebody blocked it for me but you know when you get somebody that's just constantly telling you that they praise you on one side you're a good preacher it's like yeah he doesn't know what he's talking about but you should do your church a favor and and just move them over to Christ and leave the message alone you listen to that long enough those thoughts will echo in your brain you will struggle to drive those thoughts away and that's what Satan's doing he's trying to weave the web to entangle you but I'll tell you my brother and sister Satan's plan did not account for God's plan amen all the cobwebs and all of the dust bunnies and everything that the world can place in your life amen the holy spirit will come and sweep them right out and I'm going to make an emphatic statement to you tonight my brother and sister we cannot turn back amen the bride of Christ with the word of God revealed in them there was no provision the Lord said I will lead you and guide you that means we have to abandon the Lord if we're turning back amen and he said this work I've begun in you I will finish amen so it's God to stand in that position and say Lord I just simply don't believe you I don't believe that you're going to finish this work I don't believe that you're leading me or guiding me but my brother and sister that's not the anointing on you and I as a bride of Christ somewhere in this whole picture you and I were stirred to say amen I believe that and when you said that it unloosed every Power Of Heaven to come down to you and to touch your life amen now I'm going to ask you a little chore why don't you just let your confession lead you into the promise of our day amen let's stand up and say you know what I'm a Believer amen I believe this word I'm going to say Amen to this word and then let that confession or profession just lead you into the promise of our day because you see if we'll stay away from that negative confession amen the prophet of God Called It Satan's confession amen we stay away from that okay let it come fiery trials I'm I'm finishing maybe sister via in a second here you don't have to rush amen fiery trials anybody had any nobody I don't see a hand oh okay yeah that was uh action required fiery trials have you ever just felt so overwhelmed you just felt uh for better vocabulary you just felt wiped out do you know God already factored that in that wasn't a surprise to him I see my daughter I see my son looks like they're just been hit by a steamroller that's too bad I should have made better plans for him no sir he already factored that in amen a Red Sea already in the plan Wilderness of sin already in the plan amen and we haven't gone through all this to quit I'm so proud of my sister Sue I've known her seems like my whole life but you know her her confession that she she shares is I've come too far to quit now amen I say amen sister Sue come too far to quit now amen we didn't come down this far just to turn around and say I think I'm going to see if I can make it back to Egypt I'm going to see if the Red Sea will work in reverse the Wilderness of sin maybe God will reain Mana down on me so I can go back to where I came from do you realize we went through all of this to bring us to the place that we recognize Jesus Christ in our midst we recognize that he's our peace he's our Comfort he's our security he's our healer our provider we recognize everything that we are our very existence is Jesus Christ these trials imagine what kind of people Israel would have been if they went from Egypt to the promised land you know what they would have become slaves to something else and that's a little bit direct but you see what Satan's trying to do he's trying to get you and I to become a slave to something else but our lord Jesus already provided but nowhere you guys might help me I'm not the brightest boy on the Block I searched the scripture for the plan or provision for us to go back it's not there God made no provision for you and I to go back and he said I'm going to lead you and guide you and that didn't mean he was doing a U-turn out in the wilderness somewhere to take you back if we believe he's our leader and our guide my brother and sister let's just follow let's just keep it simple amen and then I close it out with this statement when the people decided that they would rather be back serving the Egyptians you notice that Moses never caved in and gave him permission amen if a prophet was standing here today and he might acknowledge things are definitely worse than they were in the 60s you think he's going to offer us a ready made excuse for us to exercise I do believe he would say the same exact thing only believe all things are possible and if we apply that my brother and sister and you start looking you know in this scripture God I'm closing sister VI if you'd come um you notice in the scripture that in several places through the times they put up I I've been reading out of time tested memorials and you'll see that that God anointed them Brother David Nash preached it right here in this church I still remember the service very well they were those that were called anointed of God and as they crossed over Jordan they picked up a stone and They carried it up out the other side and they put them together and they said why are we doing this and this right here is when your children ask you have an answer for them amen parents grandparents we need to have an answer for our children a Godly answer a Godly example this is a sign we come out of Egypt we had a Red Sea we had a Wilderness of sin we had serpents we were hungry we were thirsty this happened and this happened and this happened but we crossed Jordan right here and entered into the presence of our Lord Jesus Christ this is it amen have we made progress we started in Egypt I don't know about you but I started in Egypt amen some of you are good Godly folks never made it out there but the Lord allowed me to make it to Egypt and then he brought me out and it hasn't always been the best Journey not nothing to boast about I remember a brother telling me one time he says you know some brother some pastors are like oh yeah we love your testimony share your testimony and one day a brother approached him afterwards and says brother is that all of your testimony he said are you kidding the rest of it I can't even say in church but it's his testimony it's the mark of the progress of what God has has done in you and I I don't even care I don't even care to talk about what I've done what happened out there in those years those times I'm not really I'm not really interested in that but I want to tell you what God's brought me to I want to tell you where where progress was made and how my life has been changed and how God is proven himself over and over again because my brother and sister this is the time for us to measure and put our our uh uh Stones as it were a - tested Memorial of what God is doing in this day hallelujah thank you for your time and your patience amen let's just sing 313 if you would brother amen hallelujah let's just stand Worship the Lord for just a minute before we
