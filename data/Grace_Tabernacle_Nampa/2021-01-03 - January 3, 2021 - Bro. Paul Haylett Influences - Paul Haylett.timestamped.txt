[33:19] wonderful supply
[33:22] you know sometimes in life you know we
[33:24] just
[33:25] to make a little natural type i had uh
[33:29] just decided yesterday that i was gonna
[33:31] go buy me a new miter saw and
[33:34] uh you know we went into the store and

[33:52] sorry it's out it's back ordered i can
[33:54] deal with that next week next month next
[33:56] year

[34:02] as the song says i'm reaching out to you
[34:04] dear lord

[34:11] needs of your life your loved ones your
[34:13] circumstance
[34:14] whatever finances uh whatever it might
[34:17] be in your life just bring that and lay
[34:19] it before the lord
[34:20] have confidence that god has an answer
[34:24] has a supply for that amen hallelujah
[34:28] hey you know sometimes i don't mean to
[34:29] embarrass anybody sometimes i actually
[34:31] rejoice
[34:32] in the crying of our children
[34:36] you know why i do it means we have
[34:39] another generation coming
[34:41] hallelujah they're not an inconvenience
[34:43] they're a blessing
[34:45] hallelujah so the parents you know uh
[34:48] they always kind of like oh my kid
[34:51] why now well you know sometimes they're
[34:54] way more conditioned to the moving of
[34:56] the spirits than we are
[34:57] and the devil he just loves to come
[34:59] along and poke the little guys or
[35:01] whatever it might be
[35:03] and you know sometimes you ever noticed
[35:05] no wait you didn't notice you're not
[35:07] preaching
[35:08] amen i'll tell you my brother and sister
[35:10] you can see the devil trying to come
[35:12] because sometimes the preaching of the
[35:14] word you can just watch
[35:15] a wave of fidget that's right do you
[35:18] guys know what fidget is
[35:20] have you ever met him amen you can be
[35:22] preaching the word in a wave of
[35:24] fidget moves through the church
[35:27] my hallelujah but don't worry we've got
[35:30] some
[35:30] fidget medicine sprinkled all over the
[35:34] house of god amen
[35:35] hallelujah good to be here today
[35:39] amen i just have to admit i woke up this
[35:42] morning
[35:43] very early looking out the window
[35:45] watching it rain
[35:47] some of you are saying oh it's raining
[35:49] brother paul's over here
[35:50] showers of blessings are falling
[35:54] hallelujah amen i want to speak to you
[35:57] once again this morning
[35:59] uh maybe part two of persuasion and
[36:01] revelation
[36:02] i'd like to speak to you on the title or
[36:04] thought of influences and
[36:06] that is such a huge subject that there's
[36:08] just simply no
[36:09] way that we could ever do anything but
[36:12] but touch
[36:13] the the fringes of it uh but we would
[36:16] remember my brother and sister
[36:18] that uh for every phrase
[36:21] that satan could throw out at you god's
[36:26] got a word to match it and remember
[36:27] god's word was first
[36:29] so satan comes and influence comes and
[36:32] people say well
[36:33] i i feel this way i feel that way i
[36:35] don't know about this i don't know about
[36:37] that
[36:37] remember what it is is we're not
[36:39] reacting to the devil
[36:41] i want you to get this we're not
[36:43] reacting to the devil the devil's
[36:45] reacting to us
[36:47] amen so when you find yourself in a
[36:50] place where satan does something and you
[36:52] find yourself trying to react to that
[36:54] stop
[36:55] you have the original word you are the
[36:58] original word
[36:59] amen so you can just stop and say satan
[37:01] i know what you're doing right now
[37:03] is because of what god is doing and
[37:05] god's in me amen we believe that right
[37:07] christ in you
[37:08] the hope of glory amen so just stop and
[37:11] and just calm down and say you know what
[37:13] satan's just trying to counteract what
[37:15] it is that god is doing in me
[37:18] amen so you know we get caught up in the
[37:20] in the hurry of life you know the bustle
[37:23] of life
[37:24] uh i use the phrase the wheels fall off
[37:26] the wagon
[37:27] you see i use that in that context
[37:29] because for each one of us something is
[37:30] a little bit different
[37:32] and and uh so in that realm you know
[37:36] what what is one man's dollar is another
[37:37] man's ten dollars which is another man's
[37:39] hundred dollars which is another man's
[37:41] thousand dollars
[37:42] you see what i'm saying so our situation
[37:44] is not exactly the same
[37:46] but as sons and daughters of god our
[37:48] situation is exactly the same we're
[37:50] standing here
[37:52] believing the word and satan's here
[37:54] opposing it
[37:55] amen but the word came first hallelujah
[37:58] aren't you glad you can stand on that
[38:00] the word came first
[38:01] it is all the critics it is
[38:05] all of the naysayers
[38:08] that come after the word amen
[38:11] let's just stand and go into our bibles
[38:12] in galatians the fifth chapter this
[38:14] morning
[38:15] amen just want to continue on in this
[38:18] thought of persuasion and revelation
[38:20] uh by god's grace i thought i could just
[38:23] make a couple parts out of it but i
[38:25] think it will probably end up being a
[38:26] little bit more
[38:28] amen thank god for his grace and mercy
[38:30] and his word this morning
[38:32] stand fast therefore in the liberty
[38:35] wherewith christ
[38:36] hath made us free
[38:42] so the word right here saints
[38:45] is showing us clearly that we're free
[38:48] amen so all we got to do is just believe
[38:51] the word this morning the words
[38:52] declaring us to be free
[38:54] amen and it's telling us not to be
[38:56] entangled
[38:57] again so showing that we have already
[39:00] seen so each one of us no matter what's
[39:02] happening in our life
[39:03] are right now can lift a hand and say i
[39:05] have experienced
[39:06] deliverance amen
[39:09] you can say well brother paul yes i was
[39:11] raised in the church i have never really
[39:13] no no i want you to understand that by
[39:16] god's grace being raised in the church
[39:18] was god's plan
[39:19] for you but you have been set free from
[39:22] a bondage
[39:23] amen we're born in sin shaped in
[39:25] iniquity coming to this world
[39:28] amen always telling the truth
[39:32] isn't it amazing that our little
[39:34] children
[39:35] i'll pick on little declan i'll pick on
[39:37] little samuel maybe a little jackson
[39:39] amen we didn't have to teach them to fib
[39:43] about the cookie jar
[39:46] it just came natural
[39:49] yes behold i paul say unto you
[39:54] you know i'm sorry i hope you forgive me
[39:56] i do have a
[39:57] just feel a little joy bubbling in my
[39:59] heart today
[40:00] i'm glad i can relate in the scripture
[40:02] this way thank you mama for naming me
[40:04] paul daniel
[40:05] amen behold i paul say unto you that if
[40:08] you be circumcised christ shall profit
[40:11] you nothing for i testify again to every
[40:13] man that is circumcised
[40:15] that he is a debtor to do the whole law
[40:18] christ has become
[40:19] of no effect unto you whosoever of ye
[40:22] are justified by the law
[40:25] ye are fallen from grace though
[40:28] we through the spirit wait for the hope
[40:30] of righteousness by faith
[40:32] for in jesus christ neither neither
[40:35] circumcision
[40:36] availeth anything nor uncircumcision
[40:40] but faith which worketh by
[40:43] love amen you did run well
[40:47] who did hinder you that should not obey
[40:49] the truth
[40:51] this persuasion cometh not of him that
[40:53] calleth you
[40:54] a little leaven leaveneth the whole lump
[40:58] amen go read this whole chapter if you
[41:00] would please say
[41:01] because it all ties together but you
[41:03] know we only have a certain time
[41:05] segment to to come into but it is such
[41:08] a lovely lovely scripture and i'm
[41:11] thankful god spoke so directly to the
[41:13] galatians because
[41:14] what they didn't realize in that day is
[41:17] the seed being planted in the ground
[41:19] amen you can go through all what the
[41:21] prophet of god what the scripture
[41:22] teaches us
[41:23] and that seed had to go in the ground
[41:25] and it had to die
[41:26] and it started to rise again but come
[41:28] into the dark ages
[41:30] and went back in you might call it
[41:31] hibernation and you can find this in the
[41:34] natural
[41:35] of winter wheat that is planted in the
[41:37] fall
[41:38] and as these rains like we have right
[41:40] now come
[41:41] and to a wheat seed laying in the ground
[41:43] it is warm
[41:45] amen and that seed then swells up and
[41:48] starts to grow
[41:49] and even as it puts out anything my
[41:52] brother and sister
[41:53] when it sprouts it is alive
[41:56] i want you to understand that when it
[41:58] sprouts it is alive
[42:00] it is not measured its life is not
[42:02] measured by the its
[42:04] size its stature but its measured by
[42:08] life and as that little seed of wheat
[42:12] that germ
[42:12] starts to come it might not even make it
[42:15] out of the soil
[42:17] and the coldness of laodicea i mean of
[42:20] january
[42:22] comes and that seed can die
[42:25] but not if it's ordained to life and
[42:28] then it can set there
[42:29] for weeks and weeks and weeks under the
[42:32] frozen
[42:33] soil but you let another day like today
[42:37] come
[42:38] and it'll poke its head out and then it
[42:40] might go back below freezing again
[42:43] and it will just set there and you think
[42:44] there's no way it can live
[42:46] through that but you let another day
[42:48] that the sun shines and it grows a
[42:50] little bit i hope you see where i'm
[42:51] going
[42:52] it grows a little bit more but don't
[42:54] judge it by its stature
[42:56] amen it's got life in it aren't you
[43:00] thankful today for life
[43:02] amen and so as that comes it's there and
[43:05] it continues to grow
[43:06] and my brother and sister i'll just cut
[43:08] this short because it's not my sermon
[43:10] but you'll find that some that was 11th
[43:12] hour wheat
[43:14] amen still comes to maturity the harvest
[43:18] still includes it
[43:20] but there might be some more mature
[43:22] around it
[43:23] and some might say well that wheat's not
[43:25] very mature
[43:27] it doesn't matter it's got life
[43:31] that's what we're looking at is life
[43:33] hallelujah
[43:34] heavenly father bless the service today
[43:36] i pray lord guide us
[43:38] give us wisdom we ask in the name of
[43:40] jesus christ amen
[43:42] you may be seated saints
[43:46] you know i want to for just a couple
[43:48] moments reflect back to
[43:49] what we were preaching on last week now
[43:52] my brother and sister we
[43:54] understand the very word of god for our
[43:56] day
[43:57] amen what god is doing now you know many
[44:00] people would say well
[44:02] this is this and that is that and you
[44:04] have to see this to see that
[44:06] i personally as time goes on i'm coming
[44:08] to the place that
[44:10] i'll just leave those things to the lord
[44:12] we can use the pulpit to decide who's in
[44:14] and who's out we can use the pulpit
[44:16] to decide what is right and wrong
[44:18] there'll be some things that with
[44:20] absolutely certainty right we can we can
[44:22] look at the word of god and say
[44:23] that is not right but you know what
[44:26] until it's over it's not over and you
[44:28] will see
[44:28] there'll be men and women who right now
[44:30] might stand in a position that is a
[44:32] little bit contrary you might say to the
[44:34] word of god
[44:35] but we don't know what god's got
[44:37] ordained it might be next month
[44:39] next week next month next year that god
[44:42] will come and move upon them
[44:43] they'll be reading their bible they will
[44:45] be studying and
[44:46] something will speak to their heart and
[44:48] their position can change
[44:50] entirely so we we want to just simply
[44:52] look as it is to the life
[44:54] that god has given and realize where the
[44:57] life
[44:57] is my brother and sister that it will
[45:00] bring us
[45:00] to the word of god to the presence of
[45:03] god for
[45:04] every seed gene right this work i have
[45:06] begun in you
[45:07] i will finish so every seed gene of god
[45:10] uh
[45:10] regardless of satan's
[45:14] approach to it amen that seed gene
[45:18] is still got the seed of life and so we
[45:20] look at that
[45:21] amen now we look at this ninth verse for
[45:25] just a moment we'll come back to the
[45:26] scriptures in just a minute
[45:28] but we'll look at this last scripture it
[45:30] says a little leaven
[45:32] leaveneth the whole lump and we know
[45:34] that leaven
[45:35] is yeast and and so it's there that you
[45:37] don't have to try to carefully sprinkle
[45:40] the yeast over
[45:41] every single drop of the bread dough or
[45:44] whatever it might be that you are making
[45:46] but you get it introduced into there and
[45:49] that 11 will leaven the whole lump
[45:51] and so we look at that and realize in a
[45:54] twofold fashion
[45:55] that this influence my brother and
[45:57] sister because that's what it is when
[45:58] leaven is introduced
[46:00] into the the the bread dough or into it
[46:03] it's an influence it's something from
[46:05] the outside that is causing something to
[46:07] change and
[46:08] you look at this and leaven or this
[46:11] influence is twofold
[46:13] my brother and sister there's obviously
[46:15] the influence to
[46:16] good and there's the influence to evil
[46:19] and i believe
[46:20] uh and pray that god would give us the
[46:22] wisdom i believe we have the wisdom to
[46:24] recognize the difference of these
[46:25] spirits
[46:26] to recognize the motives of men and the
[46:29] motives as it were
[46:30] of the influence of churches and and
[46:32] groups and authorities
[46:34] and we'll look at that and realize what
[46:36] the influence is and
[46:37] so as we'll look at this we realize
[46:40] today
[46:41] my brother and sister we can preach
[46:42] about all that's wrong in the world
[46:44] today we can preach about what is wrong
[46:46] in all of the churches today we can
[46:48] preach about
[46:49] what is wrong in the message today but
[46:51] we must realize that the holy spirit has
[46:54] come
[46:55] as a leaven to sons and daughters of god
[46:57] to
[46:58] influence you and i to good works amen
[47:01] aren't you glad of that
[47:02] to know that see we're not being drawn
[47:04] off to the side to follow
[47:06] a man it is there my brother and sister
[47:09] that is the prophet of god himself said
[47:11] i
[47:11] i didn't come to draw following to
[47:13] myself and that's what many people
[47:15] misunderstand they get the idea that
[47:17] that we're following william branham
[47:19] i'll tell you from my heart right now
[47:21] saints this is the truth
[47:22] stand before god as my witness when i
[47:24] share quotes with you
[47:26] when i read the things of brother
[47:27] branham i don't read that
[47:29] to draw attention as it were what
[47:31] brother branham william branham said
[47:33] i read those things to you because i
[47:36] believe they are well
[47:37] said and they make the point that we are
[47:39] coming they have a foundation i would
[47:41] not read a quote to you
[47:42] that did not have a foundation
[47:45] underneath it
[47:46] to influence you to good works in jesus
[47:48] christ
[47:49] we're not here just to say we follow the
[47:51] message and it's the only answer and
[47:52] that's what you must do
[47:53] because if we do my brother and sister
[47:55] the scripture says we're idolaters
[47:58] that's kind of blunt isn't it but we're
[48:01] not idolaters
[48:02] we're sons and daughters of god called
[48:05] of almighty god can we say amen to that
[48:08] i'm not here called of a man amen you
[48:10] know i don't mean to go this direction
[48:12] entirely but i want to tell you
[48:14] i left this message once when i was a
[48:16] young man
[48:18] i was free except for i wasn't
[48:25] i chose to come back there was no one
[48:28] telling me you must
[48:30] no one telling me this is what you have
[48:32] to do there was something
[48:35] inside of me compelling me
[48:38] to come back hallelujah did life get any
[48:41] easier when i came back
[48:43] no i'm telling you whether you're a
[48:44] sinner steeped in sin or whether you're
[48:46] a son or daughter of god under the blood
[48:48] of jesus christ
[48:49] life is hard life can be hard
[48:53] hallelujah full of disappointment the
[48:55] days are short
[48:57] but i'll tell you what there's a hope
[48:58] that is within
[49:00] amen you won't meet a man out here that
[49:03] is out here that is anything less than
[49:05] anointed by a satanic spirit that says i
[49:08] want to go meet the devil
[49:10] i've met a couple i can't wait to go
[49:15] i can't wait and i'm like what are you
[49:17] talking about
[49:19] and and he then it starts to expound
[49:21] like we would expound for
[49:23] our our hunger and thirst to be in the
[49:25] presence of jesus christ
[49:26] he was expressing the same exact
[49:30] expression only he wanted to go meet the
[49:32] devil
[49:34] and then you ask him a few questions and
[49:35] they're like i don't know i don't know
[49:37] i mean like do you understand that when
[49:39] you go meet the devil it's going to be a
[49:40] torment
[49:42] well i don't know i don't know
[49:46] well there's one thing i know when i get
[49:47] in the presence of almighty god
[49:49] i'm not going to be in torment i'm going
[49:51] to be in joy i'm going to be
[49:52] my heart's going to be so full i won't
[49:55] be able to hold still i won't be able to
[49:57] be quiet
[49:58] amen i will want to stand and praise him
[50:02] but my brother and sister that there's
[50:03] just a disconnect of this there so
[50:05] as satan tries to come in and he tries
[50:08] to
[50:09] leaven as it were now look my brother
[50:11] and sister certainly
[50:12] satan comes and he's still anointing his
[50:14] people but he would like to come into
[50:16] the house of god
[50:17] and all he's got to do is drop a little
[50:20] leaven
[50:21] amen and and when he drops at little
[50:23] eleven
[50:24] his hope is that that little leaven
[50:26] would then start to spread
[50:28] through the church and then the spirit
[50:30] of unbelief would start to creep
[50:32] up and down the aisles it would come to
[50:35] our children our young people
[50:36] it would come to our old people it would
[50:39] come to all
[50:40] the people and that's what he wants but
[50:42] i'll tell you what one way you want to
[50:43] do
[50:44] a deal with leaven you take 11 and you
[50:46] throw it in the oven
[50:47] amen 11 don't have 11 no more
[50:52] hallelujah when it gets about 350
[50:55] degrees in there
[50:56] the effect of leaven upon that bread is
[50:59] finished are you with me amen so we get
[51:03] the power of god we get the fire of god
[51:05] in our midst
[51:06] and satan's little leaven of unbelief
[51:08] that he throws a little here
[51:10] and throws a little there the things
[51:12] amen that we don't understand
[51:14] he throws those things out and tries to
[51:16] make a big deal of it
[51:17] but i tell you what you ever get when
[51:19] the presence of almighty god
[51:21] amen you get in that presence and it
[51:23] will burn
[51:24] every little bit of leaven out of you
[51:26] amen it will take away
[51:28] but you tell you what let me just turn
[51:30] the table before we go on
[51:32] you take 11 of the holy ghost you take
[51:34] the leaven of a son or daughter of
[51:36] god that wants to live for the lord
[51:38] there's not something out here
[51:39] crying out for sin or unbelief or doubt
[51:42] or fear
[51:42] but there's something inside that's
[51:44] crying out i want more of god
[51:47] and when the holy ghost comes it
[51:50] magnifies that
[51:51] and you find yourself more and more in
[51:53] love with the lord
[51:54] you find yourself not struggling over
[51:56] those things of the flesh that you used
[51:58] to struggle over but you can stand up
[52:00] and say
[52:00] thank you lord i have found deliverance
[52:04] amen because it is the leaven of the
[52:06] word to good works
[52:08] amen and so as god is stirring and
[52:10] moving in our life my brother and sister
[52:12] remember that we as a leaven as a son or
[52:15] daughter of god
[52:17] can also leaven the whole lung amen we
[52:19] can sit here in church full of fears and
[52:21] doubts and whatever else
[52:23] questioning are we right to do i need to
[52:25] go be a nazarene a methodist uh
[52:28] uh you know or whatever episcopalian or
[52:30] mormon or whatever it might
[52:32] the devil might torment you or basically
[52:33] nothing at all which is a religion
[52:35] amen you look at that because you'll
[52:37] find that they worship their freedom
[52:39] from everything
[52:40] amen but you look at this my brother and
[52:42] sister when the holy ghost starts to
[52:44] work in the life of a son or daughter of
[52:46] god
[52:47] the very thing that repulses others
[52:49] attracts this bride
[52:51] amen so there she's yearning for more of
[52:54] god
[52:54] and god said whenever you seek me you
[52:57] draw nigh unto me
[52:58] i will draw nigh unto you and so when we
[53:01] get leavened with this leaven
[53:02] of the holy ghost that comes down in our
[53:05] heart and we say lord i want you
[53:06] i need more of you i want revelation
[53:09] father i need your spirit first to get
[53:11] the revelation to see who i
[53:13] am and when i get that spirit anointed
[53:15] on me
[53:16] amen don't you like that i love being
[53:18] anointed of the lord
[53:19] i'll tell you yesterday i was just
[53:21] sitting there and i don't say to boast
[53:22] to myself but just there
[53:24] i was doing a little reading and i found
[53:26] myself sitting in my chair just crying
[53:28] going oh lord this is what i want to be
[53:31] this is what i want to be lord amen
[53:35] hallelujah i've never found myself
[53:37] sitting in the chair crying lord i want
[53:39] i want to be a drunk
[53:41] lord i want to be a miserable man out
[53:43] here in the streets
[53:45] i want to no never sorry ain't going to
[53:47] happen
[53:48] some people want to be that i went to
[53:50] school with a kid really good-looking
[53:52] kid he said oh i tell you what i want to
[53:53] grow up and just wow
[53:55] all the girls oh well good
[53:58] fine you grow up and be that
[54:01] amen i don't know if he got his wish or
[54:04] not
[54:04] somehow i don't think so because he
[54:06] actually became a drunk
[54:09] now that might wow some girls
[54:13] let's see how did i get there
[54:17] now going back to what we spoke on last
[54:20] week luke the 16th chapter
[54:22] we see this rich man and we're not
[54:24] really going to preach on him but i want
[54:25] to make reference to him and tie him
[54:26] into today
[54:27] amen this rich man shockingly would you
[54:31] agree with me
[54:31] shockingly ends up in hell
[54:35] it wasn't that everybody said oh that
[54:37] that man is destined
[54:39] to go to hell no my brother and sister
[54:41] the scripture brother brown ties us back
[54:43] together
[54:44] history ties it back together this is a
[54:46] rich young ruler at the finishing
[54:47] chapter of his life
[54:49] he has now obtained wealth beyond belief
[54:52] he lives sumptuously he has such a
[54:55] beautiful estate
[54:56] but yet my brother and sister when jesus
[54:58] christ comes along
[55:00] and says those words to him sell all
[55:03] thou
[55:03] hast and give to the poor
[55:07] there was the part the very word that he
[55:09] had obeyed
[55:10] i want you to catch this the very word
[55:13] he had obeyed
[55:14] in his life was now standing in front of
[55:17] him
[55:18] telling him this is a new unwritten
[55:22] chapter now the apostle paul says that
[55:25] you add one word or take one word away
[55:27] you're cursed
[55:28] your name removed from the book of life
[55:30] but my brother and sister understand
[55:31] that god
[55:32] can express through human uh uh
[55:36] you might say human intervention god can
[55:38] express anything he wants to express
[55:40] that's why you might not find a measure
[55:42] of this and this and this in the bible
[55:45] but god would express it to you but you
[55:47] have to remember what the prophet of god
[55:49] said
[55:49] he said that whatever attributes are in
[55:52] god
[55:52] will be expressed in his bride
[55:57] now look do we know all the attributes
[55:58] of god
[56:00] do we have them defined do we have them
[56:02] on the page so
[56:03] god can come and do the supernatural
[56:06] in your life and you people would say
[56:09] whoa whoa whoa i can't find that in
[56:10] scripture well i'm telling my brother
[56:12] and sister
[56:12] if it leads you closer to god and then
[56:14] hold on to it if it takes you away from
[56:17] god
[56:17] let go of it amen if it gives you an
[56:20] intellectual concept of god
[56:22] let go of it but if it reveals god in
[56:25] his fullness to you
[56:26] take a holds of it amen don't be
[56:29] confined now this is going to be a
[56:30] statement that people will probably
[56:32] criticize
[56:32] but that's fine but don't be confined by
[56:35] your understanding
[56:36] of what you read here in the bible amen
[56:39] because even these scriptures right here
[56:41] many times have such uh uh many times as
[56:45] multiples of meanings and multiples of
[56:47] time
[56:48] and so we we are there saying okay this
[56:51] must be oh that was
[56:52] that was oh you know actually you see
[56:54] malachi 3 and 4 is a perfect example
[56:56] everybody's like that was for this
[56:58] little slot in time here
[56:59] that's why what you believe is wrong
[57:01] because that's for this slot of time
[57:02] and we identify it right here you did
[57:06] we did we told god when his word fit and
[57:09] didn't
[57:11] we told god his word is valid here but
[57:13] not valid here
[57:15] you see my brother and sister there's a
[57:17] warped thinking of our intellectual
[57:19] concept
[57:20] of the word of god amen god applies his
[57:22] word where god wants to apply his word
[57:24] and you understand this and let me tie
[57:26] this together because
[57:27] all these promises of god down through
[57:30] the years
[57:31] including the very type of ruth and
[57:34] esther
[57:34] and rebecca every one of them has a
[57:37] spiritual connotation for the day that
[57:38] we live in right now
[57:40] every one of those has an application to
[57:42] the day that we live in
[57:43] so if we start blocking out the calendar
[57:46] we will look at what happened in
[57:48] esther's life amen oh i love the story
[57:50] of esther
[57:50] i love it incredible because here's
[57:53] esther with a revelation
[57:55] that my king loves me more
[57:58] than he loves protocol
[58:02] are you with me because you see even the
[58:05] queen in that day had to ask permission
[58:07] to come into the king's presence
[58:09] but esther had caught a revelation of
[58:11] who she was
[58:13] amen she didn't have an official decree
[58:16] where she come into the foyer
[58:18] and held this thing out rolled it out
[58:19] and said you guys get out of my way
[58:21] no sir she come with a confidence
[58:24] knowing
[58:25] that this king loved her above even his
[58:28] kingdom which is proven
[58:29] by the fact that he said i give you even
[58:31] up to the half of my kingdom
[58:33] in other words he was splitting
[58:34] everything right down the middle with
[58:36] her praise the lord
[58:38] did you know you're some of the richest
[58:39] people on earth
[58:41] hallelujah you possess even to the half
[58:43] of the kingdom of almighty god
[58:45] and prophet of god said that you are of
[58:47] his flesh and he is of your flesh
[58:49] you two are one amen and so we find that
[58:52] there can be no bride without a
[58:54] bridegroom and there can't be a
[58:55] bridegroom without a bride
[58:57] and so you are a part of him and he is a
[58:59] part of you
[59:00] flesh of his flesh bone of his bone
[59:02] spirit of his spirit the prophet of god
[59:04] says
[59:05] you are him she is him
[59:08] hallelujah that ought to give us a
[59:09] revelation right there and look at
[59:11] esther
[59:12] oh hallelujah i love this sorry i'm
[59:14] getting excited excuse me
[59:16] esther had such a confidence she had a
[59:19] need
[59:20] she just put on oh i can only see if we
[59:23] could just see it in that personal
[59:25] context saints
[59:26] i can see the king standing there one
[59:28] evening
[59:30] and esther wearing her hair in a certain
[59:32] fashion
[59:34] you see she didn't body yourself up to
[59:37] look like all the rest of them
[59:39] all the rest of them is we have all this
[59:40] jewelry and we have all of this and we
[59:42] have this and we have all these perfumes
[59:44] and
[59:45] we have this and we have pardon me for
[59:47] putting this so we have this low cut
[59:49] cut dress that's really going to catch
[59:52] his attention
[59:53] and she said no no no nope i'm going to
[59:56] put my hair in a certain way
[59:57] amen i'm going to dress in this fashion
[1:00:00] right here that i'm comfortable with
[1:00:02] and you know when she come to the
[1:00:03] presence of the king and he would have
[1:00:05] looked at her now i'm going out on a
[1:00:06] limb yeah let me please
[1:00:08] and he would have looked at her that
[1:00:09] evening as they're doing supper together
[1:00:11] and he would look at her and says you
[1:00:13] are so beautiful
[1:00:14] in that dress and your hair i love your
[1:00:17] hair i love
[1:00:18] how it just flows down and and it's so
[1:00:21] beautiful
[1:00:22] and my brother and sister i can assure
[1:00:24] you he wasn't looking at her with eyes
[1:00:25] of lust he was looking at her with eyes
[1:00:27] of love
[1:00:28] and he was like i love this woman
[1:00:31] vashti was this uh she was a a picture
[1:00:35] off of a magazine
[1:00:36] she was the elegance of all of the
[1:00:39] fashion
[1:00:39] but this is a woman whose wholesome
[1:00:43] integrity has taken my heart because
[1:00:46] she is what i see
[1:00:51] and because of those words he had spoken
[1:00:53] to her
[1:00:55] in the day of her need i can see her
[1:00:59] slip on that same dress
[1:01:01] i can see her do her hair in that same
[1:01:04] fashion
[1:01:06] and when she walked into the foyer
[1:01:10] of the kingdom hall and he looked down
[1:01:14] there
[1:01:15] he's like she's
[1:01:19] so beautiful but more than the fact he's
[1:01:23] beautiful she's mine
[1:01:27] and she wasn't there i i just believe
[1:01:29] this with all my heart saints she wasn't
[1:01:31] there
[1:01:31] shaking in her shoes what if he rejects
[1:01:34] me i'll be cast out
[1:01:35] i will be of the of the of his
[1:01:37] concubines i'll be put
[1:01:39] in the farthest you know corner never to
[1:01:41] see the king again
[1:01:43] supported the rest of my life but that's
[1:01:45] not why i came here i didn't come
[1:01:47] just to live sumptuously i come because
[1:01:49] i'm in love with the king
[1:01:53] i just love that story it serves my
[1:01:55] heart so much
[1:01:57] hallelujah but see this rich man
[1:02:00] shockingly ends up in hell
[1:02:02] he's concerned that his brothers are
[1:02:04] headed down that very same path
[1:02:06] the reason he's concerned saints is
[1:02:09] because they have been influenced by the
[1:02:11] very same
[1:02:12] influences that he was influenced
[1:02:16] you see now if we are just influenced to
[1:02:18] just come to church and say we believe
[1:02:20] the message
[1:02:20] and that's sufficient some people
[1:02:22] believe that now i'm not speaking down
[1:02:24] on them i'm not trying to be derogatory
[1:02:26] to them
[1:02:27] but my brother and sister the prophet of
[1:02:29] god never laid a foundation just believe
[1:02:31] god sent a prophet and you'll be okay
[1:02:33] he come to point you and i to jesus
[1:02:36] christ
[1:02:37] amen his own word says i never come to
[1:02:40] attract you to me
[1:02:41] but to point you to christ amen so we
[1:02:45] can't come and say well okay praise the
[1:02:47] lord i'm going to be saved i believe god
[1:02:48] sent a prophet
[1:02:49] the devil believes that amen there's
[1:02:52] many
[1:02:53] uh there's many denominational people
[1:02:55] believe
[1:02:56] that amen you can go on youtube there's
[1:02:58] like a woman minister
[1:03:00] and there's others that are talking
[1:03:01] about the supernatural
[1:03:03] in william branham's life amen
[1:03:05] acknowledging it was god
[1:03:06] tommy osborne who's gone now daisy
[1:03:09] osborne god now
[1:03:10] but they talked about how tommy osborne
[1:03:12] says
[1:03:13] i was seeing god in the flesh
[1:03:15] [Applause]
[1:03:17] amen but it didn't change the course of
[1:03:18] their lives
[1:03:20] they recognized it but it didn't change
[1:03:23] the course
[1:03:24] of their lives in fact tommy osborne if
[1:03:27] you know that testimony
[1:03:28] says that he then applied what he saw in
[1:03:30] brother branham's life and tommy osborne
[1:03:32] went to gather crowds
[1:03:34] all on all the continents crowds in the
[1:03:37] tens of
[1:03:38] thousands with miraculous healings and
[1:03:40] deliverances
[1:03:41] because he saw what brother branham was
[1:03:44] doing wait
[1:03:45] oh was it what brother brown was doing
[1:03:47] no sir
[1:03:48] no he'd been copying a man if he was
[1:03:50] just doing that he saw what god was
[1:03:52] doing through brother branham and by his
[1:03:54] own words he declared i know i can get
[1:03:57] in that position
[1:03:59] to find favor with god and he applied it
[1:04:02] to his own life
[1:04:04] and found favor with god and multiple
[1:04:07] multiple millions of people attended his
[1:04:09] meetings over the course of his ministry
[1:04:14] this will sound judgmental
[1:04:17] just look at the condition they were in
[1:04:18] though when they crossed to the other
[1:04:20] side
[1:04:23] they exercised the word for their hour
[1:04:26] but it was not a life-changing word
[1:04:28] for them sounds judgmental
[1:04:32] but sometimes we have to just tell it
[1:04:33] like it is amen
[1:04:35] so you see in this my brother and sister
[1:04:37] he was concerned the rich man
[1:04:39] that his brothers are under the same
[1:04:40] exact influence and so it's it's there
[1:04:43] he wants
[1:04:44] something to change but he's then told
[1:04:47] by father abraham
[1:04:48] that um though one was raised from the
[1:04:50] dead it won't change them
[1:04:51] the influence had already taken a grip
[1:04:53] upon them you have the prophet moses and
[1:04:56] and you have the apostles and you have
[1:04:57] all of this you know you have the word
[1:05:00] you have the word and if that won't
[1:05:02] change you
[1:05:04] nothing will change you influence
[1:05:07] amen i'm telling you only way the
[1:05:10] influence of laodicea
[1:05:12] will not spoil you and i is that we get
[1:05:16] sealed away in christ
[1:05:18] i don't care you can say i believe the
[1:05:20] message for 40 years nothing going to
[1:05:21] shake me
[1:05:22] no my brother and sister when the season
[1:05:24] comes and the shaking comes if there's
[1:05:26] no ceiling
[1:05:27] amen if it's not the holy ghost locked
[1:05:29] inside of us
[1:05:31] satan will come he will shake you and i
[1:05:33] and we'll come to a place well to say
[1:05:35] well
[1:05:36] you know there's a little something over
[1:05:37] here that was said and i don't
[1:05:38] understand it's unexplainable
[1:05:40] therefore it's a deal breaker well i'll
[1:05:42] tell you what my brother and sister
[1:05:43] if you can walk away from the presence
[1:05:45] of almighty god you never were in the
[1:05:47] presence of god
[1:05:50] because a man cannot once he has known
[1:05:52] the presence of god he cannot walk away
[1:05:54] from the presence of god
[1:05:55] hallelujah now if i preach a little
[1:05:58] blunt saints just forgive me okay
[1:06:01] amen i i just it's come a season that we
[1:06:04] ought to just uh
[1:06:06] well i had a friend tell it to me this
[1:06:07] way we went and aided a place one time
[1:06:10] and the food was terrible this brother
[1:06:13] and i are sitting across the table from
[1:06:14] each other
[1:06:15] we're fellowshipping we're having a good
[1:06:16] time but plain and simple the place he
[1:06:19] chose to eat the food was terrible
[1:06:22] and we're there and he goes yeah brother
[1:06:24] paul i was kind of picking around
[1:06:26] through my food and he goes yeah that's
[1:06:27] the way i feel
[1:06:29] but he says you know and that dessert
[1:06:30] come with a meal and he goes now look at
[1:06:32] it this way brother paul
[1:06:34] enough ketchup and enough whipped cream
[1:06:36] we'll walk away saying this was pretty
[1:06:38] good
[1:06:42] come on well we're not here to put
[1:06:45] ketchup and whipped cream
[1:06:46] on our meal hallelujah we we want the
[1:06:48] lamb
[1:06:49] unadorned amen we we don't want to have
[1:06:51] to dump something on it to make it
[1:06:53] palatable
[1:06:54] amen we simply want to just be able to
[1:06:56] receive the word
[1:06:58] now i come across this quote in
[1:07:00] influence here
[1:07:01] that i just you know speaking thinking
[1:07:04] of
[1:07:04] the rich man and and his passing away
[1:07:07] and
[1:07:07] all of these things and i trust you see
[1:07:09] in this quote what i saw in this quote
[1:07:12] i many times preach funerals and i never
[1:07:15] try to say too much about that person
[1:07:17] that's passed on
[1:07:18] because there's no need of saying it the
[1:07:21] people
[1:07:21] the life the man has or the woman
[1:07:23] whatever it might be has lived will
[1:07:25] speak louder to the congregation than
[1:07:27] anything i could say
[1:07:29] about them i would never change
[1:07:32] their opinion now look i don't say this
[1:07:34] for humor but i'm going to just share a
[1:07:36] little joke to you
[1:07:37] amen come from a swedish brother and he
[1:07:39] was talking about how
[1:07:40] ollie and sven's uncle passed away and
[1:07:44] so
[1:07:44] they go to the funeral and they're
[1:07:46] sitting in there and the preacher gets
[1:07:48] up
[1:07:48] and he starts talking about their uncle
[1:07:50] and they're talking about how he was a
[1:07:52] loving man and a kind man
[1:07:54] and a sharing man and compassionate and
[1:07:57] loved his family so much
[1:07:58] and only turns to then and says i think
[1:08:01] we're at the wrong funeral
[1:08:08] you see no matter what the preacher said
[1:08:10] oli and sven
[1:08:12] knew their uncle huh
[1:08:19] i would never change their opinion their
[1:08:20] life told what they were
[1:08:23] and then we never know just what we're
[1:08:24] doing what influence
[1:08:26] what we're doing is having upon others
[1:08:29] the bible said we are written epistles
[1:08:31] read of all men
[1:08:32] that is your life reads so loud to the
[1:08:35] public
[1:08:36] until your testimony if it's contrary to
[1:08:38] your life
[1:08:39] is without any effect it's what you
[1:08:42] are inside of you that the people read
[1:08:46] not so much what you say but what you
[1:08:49] are
[1:08:49] see oh my pretty direct right
[1:08:53] oh hallelujah now look at this you can
[1:08:55] pin
[1:08:56] something on somebody and say this is
[1:08:58] that and so forth but your life
[1:09:00] being different from what they say your
[1:09:02] testimony of your life is
[1:09:04] louder than the testimony that someone
[1:09:07] could say something about you
[1:09:09] that's what you want it to be right yeah
[1:09:13] so just keep that in mind that we're
[1:09:15] bringing influences every day and the
[1:09:17] life that you live
[1:09:18] proves what's on the inside of you you
[1:09:20] cannot change that
[1:09:22] it reflects hallelujah i was just
[1:09:25] sharing with brother jason in the back
[1:09:26] room there for a minute amen
[1:09:28] some things sister jerry and i just kind
[1:09:30] of in our our studies and
[1:09:31] and talking together and sharing my
[1:09:33] brother and sister i don't want to give
[1:09:34] the cat away but we're probably going to
[1:09:36] preach on some reflections reflecting
[1:09:38] reflector
[1:09:39] because it's incredible the different
[1:09:41] things that we read and hear and study
[1:09:44] upon that my brother and sister and the
[1:09:45] prophet of god right here he says you
[1:09:47] cannot
[1:09:48] change that it reflects every person
[1:09:51] reflects
[1:09:51] outside what he is inside
[1:09:55] now look you cannot see my inside right
[1:09:58] now my brother and sister you simply
[1:10:01] or can you
[1:10:06] the truth is is the more clever we
[1:10:09] become
[1:10:11] the more revealed we
[1:10:14] are
[1:10:18] think about it well i'm not here for
[1:10:21] your money
[1:10:23] pretty soon it'd be like sister naughty
[1:10:24] how much money you got
[1:10:27] church yoda
[1:10:31] oh we're not out power but i don't want
[1:10:33] you guys going on vacation unless you
[1:10:34] ask me
[1:10:36] i'm not trying to control you but don't
[1:10:39] buy a car
[1:10:40] without permission and i've got four
[1:10:42] selected colors
[1:10:44] white white white and white
[1:10:49] no you see my brother and sister this
[1:10:51] always comes out
[1:10:53] you just watch you get into the word
[1:10:56] you study the word and then you'll find
[1:10:59] that god reveals to you just like a good
[1:11:01] quail hunter
[1:11:03] he can walk out there in all the brush
[1:11:05] and country and he can look over there
[1:11:06] and say the quail are right there and
[1:11:08] you're thinking how does that man know
[1:11:09] the quail right there well what you
[1:11:11] don't know is every
[1:11:12] time he's ever went hunting there that's
[1:11:13] where the quail were at
[1:11:15] amen so you look at this and with
[1:11:17] experience
[1:11:19] can we actually lift a hand and say
[1:11:21] thank you lord for our experience
[1:11:24] oh you say but we've had problems we
[1:11:25] have struggles you know if you knew the
[1:11:27] things that have gone through our family
[1:11:28] almost like a plague almost like a
[1:11:30] influenza almost like covid
[1:11:32] went through our family and blah blah
[1:11:33] blah thank god for it
[1:11:36] thank god for it he's schooling you
[1:11:39] amen hallelujah sister sharon i'll tell
[1:11:41] you what kind of funny in a way
[1:11:44] i'm looking at the magazine on the on
[1:11:46] the on the
[1:11:47] the board in the in the foyer there and
[1:11:49] i'm looking at that
[1:11:50] and i'm thinking why is this magazine on
[1:11:53] this board and i'm thinking somebody
[1:11:54] ought to take i don't know why this is
[1:11:55] there
[1:11:56] and finally sister jerry's like uh um
[1:11:59] that's uh sister sharon on the front of
[1:12:00] it
[1:12:01] oh hey praise the lord that's sister
[1:12:03] cher we ought to have this magazine here
[1:12:12] but if no one had ever brought my
[1:12:14] attention
[1:12:16] that was sister sharon i might have went
[1:12:18] there one day and unpinned that thing
[1:12:20] and dropped it in the trash
[1:12:24] but it was not the sister sharon i know
[1:12:26] because she doesn't come to church
[1:12:27] wearing a flat
[1:12:28] whatever they call those tap
[1:12:32] and and a gown amen
[1:12:36] same smile that's smiling right now or
[1:12:38] smiling right there
[1:12:39] it's the same deal but you see sometimes
[1:12:41] we don't recognize it
[1:12:43] until it's right there well let me put
[1:12:45] it this way to you
[1:12:46] let god be so revealed in you
[1:12:49] that no matter where you are at they
[1:12:52] recognize
[1:12:53] christ in you and you're at work you're
[1:12:56] at uh disney world or whatever you know
[1:12:59] what i'm saying just an example
[1:13:00] you're at the coast you're in the
[1:13:02] mountaintop you're in the mall say amen
[1:13:05] sisters
[1:13:06] and so it's there that you would be
[1:13:08] recognized as a daughter of god
[1:13:10] a son of god no matter where your
[1:13:12] picture got posted up
[1:13:14] hallelujah see it reflects every person
[1:13:18] reflects outside what he is inside
[1:13:20] and if we take the testimony of being
[1:13:22] christians
[1:13:23] i think that that that i think that
[1:13:27] that is one of the most solemn things
[1:13:29] that a man or a woman a boy or a girl
[1:13:31] could
[1:13:32] do would when he takes on the name of
[1:13:34] christ
[1:13:35] then he is going to be a representative
[1:13:38] of christ
[1:13:39] you should watch every move you make
[1:13:41] because somebody is watching you
[1:13:44] and in this it reflects what god has
[1:13:46] done for you
[1:13:48] inside of you amen not on the outside my
[1:13:52] brother sister i read you that quote the
[1:13:54] other day brother branham said
[1:13:55] it's not on the outside amen but let it
[1:13:58] be on the
[1:13:59] inside that we say that's right because
[1:14:02] we
[1:14:02] can make this outside conform now if you
[1:14:05] don't believe so my brother and sister i
[1:14:07] had a friend
[1:14:08] this is just an example i had a friend
[1:14:10] right out of high school
[1:14:11] i was actually supposed to go in the
[1:14:12] military with him i chickened out
[1:14:14] he went ahead and signed up and went on
[1:14:16] into the military
[1:14:17] and you know he he goes in the military
[1:14:20] he's there for four years he comes out
[1:14:22] the day they let him out his hair is
[1:14:25] high and tight i believe is what they
[1:14:26] call that you know how the military are
[1:14:28] just a little hair on top cut right out
[1:14:31] it was in six months he had hair down
[1:14:33] the middle of his back
[1:14:34] so my brother and sister what he was in
[1:14:36] the military
[1:14:37] is not what he was after so it was there
[1:14:40] as long as he was in a position
[1:14:42] he had to conform he had no problem with
[1:14:44] his short haircut
[1:14:45] but then he went out and he was
[1:14:47] expressing himself who he was he had
[1:14:49] long hair in school
[1:14:51] amen and so come now later on in life i
[1:14:53] bumped him to him a few times
[1:14:55] and he was back to looking like a man
[1:14:56] again but you look at that my brother
[1:14:58] and sister you see
[1:14:59] as long as he was conforming he had
[1:15:02] short hair
[1:15:06] but the minute was up to him he said no
[1:15:07] more i've had enough of this short hair
[1:15:11] hallelujah i think he quit wearing it
[1:15:13] long because everybody told him that he
[1:15:15] made a really cute girl
[1:15:18] i have to admit i was guilty of that my
[1:15:20] own self
[1:15:21] i would tell him brent if he wasn't a
[1:15:24] man you'd be a beautiful woman
[1:15:26] amen he didn't like that but it was the
[1:15:28] truth
[1:15:30] hallelujah amen
[1:15:33] now we look at this i want to go back to
[1:15:34] galatians here i want to go back to the
[1:15:36] first verse if we could brother
[1:15:38] alex amen i need to move right along
[1:15:40] here
[1:15:41] so now if we'll take these first words
[1:15:44] of what
[1:15:44] paul speaks to the galatians he says
[1:15:46] stand fast there in the liberty
[1:15:48] wherewith christ hath made us free
[1:15:51] so we as i already kind of got ahead of
[1:15:52] myself with speaking this
[1:15:54] we understand that we have to have uh
[1:15:57] uh to to take this uh being made
[1:16:01] uh being made free being set free this
[1:16:04] liberty we had to have been in bondage
[1:16:06] at some time and so we understand that
[1:16:08] that without god we just simply
[1:16:10] would be born and would become a product
[1:16:13] of our environment
[1:16:14] amen but i believe the second half of
[1:16:17] that scripture
[1:16:19] is the real powerful side we need to see
[1:16:21] that we've already been set free amen
[1:16:24] we'll say here as i spoke to you last
[1:16:25] sunday if satan's going to
[1:16:28] hold something up he might hold up a a
[1:16:31] a paper he might hold up something and
[1:16:33] say you know
[1:16:34] this this is your sin i've got it on
[1:16:36] this page here i've got it wrote down
[1:16:38] every mistake you ever made in your life
[1:16:40] but you'll realize my brother and sister
[1:16:41] this is simply a xerox coffee
[1:16:44] he don't have your sin your sins under
[1:16:46] the blood satan can't even get to it if
[1:16:47] he wants to
[1:16:49] he's just sitting back with a
[1:16:51] stenographer
[1:16:52] and every time you send he tells them
[1:16:54] write that down
[1:16:55] so he's got a list but you see the blood
[1:16:58] of jesus christ made his list invalid
[1:17:02] amen just like you could go and have a
[1:17:05] whole list of all the passwords that are
[1:17:06] your computer
[1:17:08] and you go down and decide you know
[1:17:09] because brother uh isaac got a holds of
[1:17:11] you brother alex got a holds of you and
[1:17:13] said you know what
[1:17:14] uh your your passwords are 10 years old
[1:17:17] and they're so easy
[1:17:18] i i could break into your computer and
[1:17:20] so you're like okay
[1:17:22] and you know you sit down with a little
[1:17:23] advice and you start coming up with
[1:17:25] these asterisks and this
[1:17:26] plus signs and this thing and that thing
[1:17:28] and whatever and pretty soon you got
[1:17:30] like a 10
[1:17:30] 10 letter uh password uh that's
[1:17:34] uh you know the computer says strong
[1:17:36] that is a good one
[1:17:37] you can take your old list of passwords
[1:17:40] and give them to the devil i mean
[1:17:41] anybody you want to and they can sit
[1:17:44] down at your computer
[1:17:46] and they can enter them as many times as
[1:17:48] they want to
[1:17:50] but they can't get in hallelujah
[1:17:53] aren't you glad the password to your
[1:17:55] life is under the blood of jesus christ
[1:17:58] amen he is the key to your life
[1:18:01] and satan cannot get in there and i love
[1:18:04] that quote
[1:18:05] i'm going to misquote it severely this
[1:18:07] morning but i love that quote
[1:18:08] brother branham says if he's going to
[1:18:10] get in under the blood
[1:18:11] he would no longer be your adversary
[1:18:13] saints he would be your brother
[1:18:15] amen so just keep your life hid in
[1:18:18] christ
[1:18:18] and satan can't even get into it amen
[1:18:22] so be not entangled again so that is
[1:18:24] clearly declaring
[1:18:26] us we are free this morning hallelujah
[1:18:28] can you say amen
[1:18:30] can you rejoice down in your soul we're
[1:18:32] free this morning
[1:18:34] hallelujah but paul says you know what
[1:18:38] i say unto you if you be circumcised
[1:18:40] christ shall profit you nothing
[1:18:43] what what's happening here
[1:18:48] for i testify again to every man that is
[1:18:50] circumcised that he is a debtor to do
[1:18:52] the whole law you know when i was
[1:18:54] studying this out the devil come to me
[1:18:56] and said you know if you preach on that
[1:18:57] you're going to speak
[1:18:58] directly against what brother david
[1:19:00] spoke wednesday night
[1:19:02] can you believe that the devil's such a
[1:19:04] cheat shot trying to just
[1:19:05] is he's trying to put that brother david
[1:19:08] encouraging us to do the right thing
[1:19:10] not be rebels out here in this life and
[1:19:12] i was like wait just a second
[1:19:14] it is that and i'm looking that i'm
[1:19:16] looking i'm looking at and i said no
[1:19:17] devil that's not the truth
[1:19:19] that's not the truth what this is right
[1:19:21] here my brother and sister is there was
[1:19:23] those that were coming in amongst the
[1:19:25] gentile
[1:19:26] converts to christ and telling them if
[1:19:28] you're going to be a real
[1:19:30] christian if you're going to be a real
[1:19:34] christian
[1:19:34] man you're going to go get circumcised
[1:19:36] paul's coming and telling them you know
[1:19:38] what
[1:19:38] you can be obedient to the law of moses
[1:19:42] and all you're doing is binding yourself
[1:19:44] to be a debtor to the law
[1:19:47] it was not see the gentiles come not
[1:19:49] under
[1:19:50] a law dispensation but under a grace
[1:19:53] dispensation
[1:19:54] but let me tie this all in a nice little
[1:19:56] not for you my brother and sister
[1:19:57] obedience
[1:19:58] is better than sacrifice so we can say
[1:20:02] well i don't that i'm obligated
[1:20:04] to what that was i was preached my
[1:20:06] brother and sister
[1:20:07] study it out for yourself but you'll
[1:20:09] find that obedience
[1:20:10] always pays a greater dividend than
[1:20:12] sacrifice does
[1:20:15] so you look at that he says now every
[1:20:17] man that's testified he's a debtor to do
[1:20:19] the whole law
[1:20:20] circumcised i mean christ has become of
[1:20:22] no effect to you
[1:20:23] what is he meaning here if we start
[1:20:26] checking through the list
[1:20:27] i passed this one i passed this when i
[1:20:29] passed this one
[1:20:30] that's what the rich young ruler did
[1:20:34] i have done all of this since my
[1:20:37] youth but you see he become a deader
[1:20:40] then
[1:20:41] he didn't have a liberty if he just said
[1:20:43] jesus i don't understand what you're
[1:20:45] saying
[1:20:46] you're telling me to sell everything i
[1:20:47] have and i've already in this young age
[1:20:50] amassed a fortune and you're telling me
[1:20:52] to give it away
[1:20:53] but nonetheless at thy word lord
[1:20:58] nonetheless who said that mary
[1:21:03] mary anointed by a word she was there
[1:21:05] now you look at this think about this
[1:21:07] saints
[1:21:07] how many virgins when that prophecy was
[1:21:10] given
[1:21:11] 600 years i believe it was approximately
[1:21:14] time goes on
[1:21:15] how many virgins thought oh if that
[1:21:17] could be me
[1:21:18] but here's little mary it seems like
[1:21:20] she's maybe off the beaten path
[1:21:22] she's not really into that she's just
[1:21:24] living her life and when the angel comes
[1:21:26] to her
[1:21:27] and says you have found favor in the
[1:21:30] eyes of god
[1:21:32] and she is there how can this be i can't
[1:21:34] have a baby
[1:21:35] i've never known a man this boggles my
[1:21:38] mind
[1:21:39] but there was anointing there and
[1:21:41] something struck her and the angel tells
[1:21:43] her
[1:21:43] what is that this is so deep my brother
[1:21:45] and sister you
[1:21:47] have found favor
[1:21:51] oh hallelujah can somebody say thank you
[1:21:54] lord
[1:21:55] amen it's not matter we volunteered or
[1:21:58] we come in this all we're special
[1:22:00] we found favor in the sight of almighty
[1:22:04] god
[1:22:05] hallelujah and so it's there if christ
[1:22:08] becomes non-effect to us my brother and
[1:22:09] sister
[1:22:10] if we're justified we're not even in
[1:22:12] god's grace
[1:22:14] and we know that we can't live the law
[1:22:17] come on let's just be honest with
[1:22:18] ourselves we can't live the law
[1:22:23] amen says neither circumcision availeth
[1:22:27] anything or nor uncircumcision but faith
[1:22:31] which worketh by love amen
[1:22:34] oh i tell you that's just to me it's
[1:22:36] really deep
[1:22:38] you did run well who did hinder you
[1:22:41] that you should not obey the truth
[1:22:45] let's tie it back together here i was
[1:22:47] like devil be quiet
[1:22:50] be quiet
[1:22:53] the true does truth doesn't have to come
[1:22:55] out preached as law
[1:22:57] the truth comes out if god says it
[1:23:01] obey it why
[1:23:04] because i love you lord i love you lord
[1:23:08] amen
[1:23:09] hallelujah
[1:23:14] it's persuasion
[1:23:19] look what's happened here a people
[1:23:23] that have been delivered called of
[1:23:26] almighty god
[1:23:27] now they're coming and someone is
[1:23:30] starting to tell them
[1:23:31] if you are going to serve god if you're
[1:23:34] going to
[1:23:34] serve god you have to do this and this
[1:23:38] and this and this and you know what
[1:23:41] happens
[1:23:43] pretty soon the joy and the liberty we
[1:23:45] have in jesus christ
[1:23:46] fades away and we go to church
[1:23:50] and we do what we do because it's
[1:23:52] expected of us
[1:23:55] that is called tradition
[1:23:58] that is called unbridled religion
[1:24:02] that is a denominational spirit
[1:24:06] that is a babylonian spirit
[1:24:12] but look at this where's this persuasion
[1:24:15] coming from
[1:24:16] i want to ask you this morning saints i
[1:24:18] don't mean to be too rough
[1:24:20] the influences on your life i want you
[1:24:23] to think about what is happening in your
[1:24:24] life what you did last week what you're
[1:24:26] planning to do this next week
[1:24:28] i want to ask you where did that
[1:24:30] persuasion come from
[1:24:37] don't frown at me don't all get pouty
[1:24:39] lipped
[1:24:40] hallelujah unless you're talking about
[1:24:42] robbing a bank or something here you've
[1:24:44] got nothing to fear
[1:24:46] amen but to recognize how influence can
[1:24:48] be so strong
[1:24:50] the persuasion can be so strong
[1:24:54] amen i've got testimonies recorded in my
[1:24:57] head
[1:24:59] bad place to store them but i've got
[1:25:01] testimonies of believers
[1:25:04] around the world of coming and making
[1:25:06] declarations
[1:25:07] to tomorrow i was going to go do
[1:25:11] this and this but i thought well i
[1:25:14] should go to church today and they got
[1:25:16] in the house of god
[1:25:18] and my brother and sister it might have
[1:25:19] been brother paul that was speaking but
[1:25:21] brother paul was clueless
[1:25:22] amen so it had to be the lord and
[1:25:25] something was
[1:25:26] said that turned the direction of that
[1:25:28] life
[1:25:29] and their plans for tomorrow have been
[1:25:31] now
[1:25:32] canceled curtailed because they know
[1:25:35] that that wasn't right
[1:25:36] and they sat there by their own words
[1:25:38] and said i realized
[1:25:39] i was under an influence and that
[1:25:42] influence was not according to the word
[1:25:43] of god
[1:25:45] hallelujah thank you lord for his holy
[1:25:47] spirit for discerning the hearts
[1:25:49] of sons and daughters of god that when
[1:25:51] we would have went and made a mistake in
[1:25:53] our life
[1:25:54] that we might have felt condemnation and
[1:25:56] been a burden on our heart for the rest
[1:25:58] of our life
[1:25:59] and god comes and says just a second i
[1:26:01] want to give you a persuasion
[1:26:02] to point you in a different direction a
[1:26:05] persuasion that would
[1:26:07] change your focus change your point of
[1:26:10] view
[1:26:10] can someone say thank you lord
[1:26:13] hallelujah
[1:26:15] hallelujah amen
[1:26:18] you see this persuasion didn't come from
[1:26:20] the one that called you
[1:26:22] and then we're back to a little leaven
[1:26:23] leaveneth the whole lump
[1:26:25] what is it influence the one
[1:26:28] who's called you isn't that beautiful
[1:26:32] it's not of him that called
[1:26:36] hallelujah that's such a beautiful
[1:26:38] thought
[1:26:39] the persuasion to just go and let
[1:26:43] laodicea have its way to be blown with
[1:26:45] every wind
[1:26:46] my brother and sister that's not the
[1:26:47] persuasion of the one that calls you
[1:26:50] amen god's got a sure calling i'll tell
[1:26:53] you i know that for sure in my life as i
[1:26:55] started to come back to the lord
[1:26:57] amen i struggled and i struggled and i
[1:26:59] struggled and i caused my wife a lot of
[1:27:01] grief
[1:27:02] my brother and sister but that voice was
[1:27:04] very persuasive
[1:27:05] and it was there it kept reminding me in
[1:27:07] many many many ways
[1:27:09] you don't belong in this world amen i go
[1:27:11] out and i would try
[1:27:13] you know to kind of fit in i kind of try
[1:27:15] and do my thing and
[1:27:16] and you know real i i don't i don't fit
[1:27:18] with these guys
[1:27:19] but then this is the sad part i come to
[1:27:22] church and i didn't feel like i fit here
[1:27:24] either
[1:27:25] ouch but you know i didn't feel like i
[1:27:29] fit here either
[1:27:31] because i had left the crumbs of those
[1:27:34] thoughts
[1:27:35] on my table
[1:27:40] yeah that's why you got to make a clean
[1:27:43] break
[1:27:44] that's when you clean house you really
[1:27:46] clean house
[1:27:47] amen you don't sit there and say well
[1:27:49] you know what i'm gonna put the bible
[1:27:51] back in my house but i'm gonna leave all
[1:27:53] the movies and music in my house
[1:27:55] no i'm sorry those crumbs will still
[1:27:57] destroy you
[1:27:58] amen you got to come and do a clean
[1:28:00] sweep in this natural house and
[1:28:02] and just clean it out and say lord now
[1:28:04] i'm just committing this house to you
[1:28:06] i'm telling you what do you got to lose
[1:28:09] that's what i've told many a man i wish
[1:28:11] they'd come and serve the lord but i've
[1:28:12] told many a man what do you really got
[1:28:14] to lose you're miserable right now even
[1:28:16] if you won't admit it
[1:28:19] and i look over at them and they're
[1:28:20] shaking their head they won't say it out
[1:28:22] loud but they're shaking their head
[1:28:23] yeah i'm miserable what do you got to
[1:28:26] lose
[1:28:28] you're not happy now why not come to the
[1:28:30] house of god and let brother paul just
[1:28:32] yell and screech at you
[1:28:34] and you can leave here not happy no
[1:28:40] difference
[1:28:42] had to kind of put these words to
[1:28:44] another person that
[1:28:45] i care about don't knock it
[1:28:50] till you've tried it i had no idea how
[1:28:53] powerful that would be because it shut
[1:28:55] him up he's never said another word
[1:28:56] about it
[1:28:57] because you see he doesn't want to give
[1:28:59] his heart to the lord but he hates his
[1:29:01] condition position in the world
[1:29:05] i wish i didn't drink i wish i didn't
[1:29:08] smoke i wish i
[1:29:09] oh i'm not happy my life is miserable
[1:29:12] well why don't you come over here and
[1:29:14] serve god oh i couldn't do that
[1:29:15] religious thing
[1:29:18] well don't knock it till you try it
[1:29:24] second peter 1 and 10 says wherefore the
[1:29:27] rather brethren
[1:29:27] give diligence to make your calling an
[1:29:29] election sure
[1:29:30] for if you do these things ye shall
[1:29:33] never fall
[1:29:34] isn't that beautiful amen there's a
[1:29:36] guarantee that if we
[1:29:38] would make a sure stand for god
[1:29:42] amen that we would put ourselves in a
[1:29:44] position
[1:29:45] for god to bless us yes you've got to be
[1:29:47] in a position amen
[1:29:48] you can't have one foot in the world
[1:29:50] amen you can't be up to the knees in the
[1:29:52] world
[1:29:52] and then expect to put your toe into the
[1:29:54] word of god and god make a difference in
[1:29:56] your life
[1:29:57] amen god doesn't like those fence
[1:29:59] straddling compromising people
[1:30:01] god wants people that are sold out
[1:30:03] hallelujah hebrews 6
[1:30:05] 9-10 amen but beloved
[1:30:09] this is the scripture i love i'm
[1:30:10] speaking this to you today saints
[1:30:13] but beloved we are persuaded
[1:30:16] better things of you things that
[1:30:18] accompany salvation
[1:30:20] though we though we thus speak
[1:30:24] for god is not unrighteous to forget
[1:30:26] your work and labor of love
[1:30:28] which you have shown toward his name and
[1:30:30] that you have ministered to the saints
[1:30:32] and do minister amen now i want you to
[1:30:35] take this
[1:30:36] i want you to tie this back to that
[1:30:37] quote i just read to you a few minutes
[1:30:39] ago
[1:30:41] now when you find yourself
[1:30:45] well i'm not a minister yes you are
[1:30:49] everywhere you go everything you
[1:30:54] say every attitude we display
[1:31:00] ouch
[1:31:02] ministers to someone
[1:31:08] praise god i haven't missed a church
[1:31:10] service in 25
[1:31:11] years
[1:31:14] and i haven't missed an opportunity
[1:31:18] to flee someone in 25 years
[1:31:26] somehow it doesn't go together that's
[1:31:29] not the key that unlocks god's promises
[1:31:32] my brother and sister
[1:31:35] see paul speaking here
[1:31:41] he's persuaded
[1:31:44] better things oh hallelujah
[1:31:48] now look real quick
[1:31:54] we see satan's foundation matthew 4
[1:31:57] amen i didn't have brother alex uh to
[1:32:00] put that up
[1:32:01] but matthew 4 we see the foundation for
[1:32:03] satan's temptation
[1:32:05] he's he's telling jesus now if you'll do
[1:32:07] this i'll do this
[1:32:09] if you do this i'll do this you do this
[1:32:11] i'll do this and we see
[1:32:12] satan's foundation for temptation
[1:32:15] was based in reasoning so you would come
[1:32:18] down and satan would say now if you'll
[1:32:20] bow down and worship me i'll give you
[1:32:21] the whole world right
[1:32:23] they're the very foundation when brother
[1:32:24] branham talks about god of this evil age
[1:32:26] there's a lot of critics out there that
[1:32:28] are saying well he don't know what he's
[1:32:29] talking about you know
[1:32:31] uh blah blah blah god's still in control
[1:32:32] yes he is but he gave the drama over to
[1:32:35] the devil the ultimate control is god's
[1:32:38] control but the drama has been given
[1:32:40] over to the devil
[1:32:41] and satan lucifer raises him up to the
[1:32:44] pinnacle of the temple and says you know
[1:32:45] what if you'll
[1:32:46] bow down and follow me i'll give you the
[1:32:48] whole world you see it was his to give
[1:32:49] he wasn't even lying
[1:32:54] that was a foundation reasoning
[1:32:57] but we see jesus foundation for
[1:32:59] overcoming
[1:33:00] he simply come back and said it is
[1:33:02] written
[1:33:03] amen he didn't have to reason with it he
[1:33:05] didn't have to
[1:33:06] try and justify it he didn't have to
[1:33:08] figure out well why
[1:33:10] why would the bible say this or why
[1:33:13] would
[1:33:13] um this purported prophet of god say
[1:33:16] this
[1:33:16] uh why if this is this then that is that
[1:33:19] then that means that's wrong if this is
[1:33:21] like this this would fit but it's not
[1:33:22] like that it's like this
[1:33:23] so and pretty soon people say well i
[1:33:26] just i won't even bother
[1:33:28] i won't even bother trying to serve god
[1:33:29] i'll just walk away i'll just ignore it
[1:33:31] because i don't understand what it's
[1:33:33] done you see what happened is the satans
[1:33:35] injected
[1:33:36] that little molecule that little vaccine
[1:33:39] if you would call it of unbelief of
[1:33:41] doubt of fear
[1:33:43] amen i'll tell you my brother and sister
[1:33:45] he does a good job of it
[1:33:47] amen so it's there that you see what is
[1:33:50] written
[1:33:51] you can go right back to it it's a
[1:33:52] reference you can take a hold of that
[1:33:54] right here i i i like this you know
[1:33:59] just well i won't go there but anyway uh
[1:34:01] you know i just saw a beautiful little
[1:34:03] deal a brother
[1:34:04] shared that shows the bible
[1:34:07] opened and then it's like something was
[1:34:10] wrote across the face of it you know
[1:34:13] don't take someone else's word for it
[1:34:16] read it for yourself
[1:34:21] come on saints you see we've been given
[1:34:25] ample opportunity
[1:34:26] to read it for ourselves to search the
[1:34:28] scripture amen
[1:34:31] so you look at this and realize see uh
[1:34:33] what is written
[1:34:35] i want you to think about this now we
[1:34:37] have some very intellectual people in
[1:34:38] the message right i'm talking about men
[1:34:40] that are rocket scientists kind of
[1:34:41] people
[1:34:42] people that they're sats and all these
[1:34:44] other things they just move way up there
[1:34:46] amen praise the lord when the word said
[1:34:49] i'd reveal it
[1:34:51] to people like paul
[1:34:55] why well i'm sorry
[1:34:59] maybe my calling is a farming you know
[1:35:01] some people say well paul you're so
[1:35:02] fortunate to be a farmer
[1:35:03] maybe god checked my iq beforehand said
[1:35:07] this guy can put a seed in the ground
[1:35:08] and he can water it
[1:35:09] and i'll make it grow so he's got it
[1:35:12] made
[1:35:15] but show me where god said create this
[1:35:18] big formula
[1:35:21] i also seen a deal on the internet here
[1:35:22] a while back and it was literally a
[1:35:24] screen
[1:35:24] full of figures and whatever else and it
[1:35:27] come down
[1:35:28] and then it says or you could just
[1:35:30] simply
[1:35:31] and it showed one plus one equals two
[1:35:36] god in simplicity if god said it
[1:35:40] he meant it all we have to do is believe
[1:35:44] it
[1:35:44] amen we don't have to come up with some
[1:35:47] formula to figure out
[1:35:49] how this happened how could god have
[1:35:52] possibly done this this this and this
[1:35:54] i don't know how god did it but i
[1:35:56] believe he did it
[1:35:57] amen amen i was visiting brother andrew
[1:36:02] glover the other day and he made a
[1:36:03] statement and i liked it a lot he says
[1:36:05] you know
[1:36:05] taking he's we were our conversation
[1:36:07] with such as what brother branham
[1:36:08] preached
[1:36:09] lines up with the bible so to put that
[1:36:11] in context
[1:36:12] he said yep brother branham said it i
[1:36:15] believe it
[1:36:16] let's just go on
[1:36:20] don't sit here and say now when i can
[1:36:21] figure out what happened in this vision
[1:36:23] when i can figure out what happened over
[1:36:24] here and i can figure out this when i
[1:36:26] figure out that go ahead you'll spend
[1:36:28] all your time figuring
[1:36:29] but if you get one little part of that
[1:36:31] equation wrong you're gonna have the
[1:36:32] wrong answer
[1:36:32] amen my or you can just simply believe
[1:36:36] that one plus one equals two
[1:36:39] amen now look what what is this it is
[1:36:41] written see
[1:36:42] it's almost too much to comprehend
[1:36:44] saints what has been
[1:36:46] written about you and i through the
[1:36:48] scripture
[1:36:49] our mind would not contain all of this
[1:36:52] scripture we could not repeat it we can
[1:36:54] find it over time
[1:36:55] but we could not repeat all of the
[1:36:56] scripture pertaining to you and i
[1:36:59] and the hour that we live in because
[1:37:01] part of it there's scripture
[1:37:02] that is veiled that we don't even
[1:37:04] understand applies to us
[1:37:06] in this day because we thought it was
[1:37:08] entirely for a different age
[1:37:10] so it's been just an incredible amount
[1:37:13] let me put it this way
[1:37:14] age old promises to this bride
[1:37:17] are coming to pass in this day amen and
[1:37:21] we're talking about not just new
[1:37:22] testament we're talking old testament
[1:37:24] right back to the very beginning
[1:37:26] age-old promises saints that we don't
[1:37:28] even recognize but we're spoken
[1:37:31] and they apply to you and i and they are
[1:37:32] coming to pass
[1:37:34] hallelujah that ought to make somebody
[1:37:36] really really exciting
[1:37:38] amen hallelujah now let's go right here
[1:37:40] in a time of decision
[1:37:42] eliezer when he had the assurance that
[1:37:43] the angel was going before him
[1:37:46] then he could decide to go because he
[1:37:49] had something to back
[1:37:50] him up and i think that ought to be the
[1:37:52] assurance of every man of god that
[1:37:54] preaches the gospel
[1:37:55] that he's got something positive from
[1:37:57] god that'll back up what he preaches
[1:37:59] if you haven't got it brethren it's for
[1:38:02] you
[1:38:03] god still sends his men with an angel
[1:38:05] before him when he goes to take the
[1:38:07] message to the church not only that but
[1:38:09] when elies are left the father of isaac
[1:38:11] which represented the father of christ
[1:38:13] he loaded the whole train of camels with
[1:38:16] good
[1:38:17] gifts for the bride oh hallelujah i have
[1:38:21] got a
[1:38:21] whole camel train of promises for me
[1:38:29] i thought maybe somebody jump out of
[1:38:30] their seat and say hallelujah
[1:38:33] brother paul i'm sorry but i'm the bride
[1:38:37] come on got a whole train of camels with
[1:38:40] good gifts for the bride
[1:38:42] oh i feel religious right now oh how i
[1:38:44] love jesus
[1:38:45] he loaded the camels full of good gifts
[1:38:47] to give to the bride
[1:38:48] and he never told her that they were for
[1:38:51] another generation
[1:38:52] or another day but they were for
[1:38:55] the bride the very promised word that
[1:38:59] speaks of eliezer my brother and sister
[1:39:01] applies to you and i today hallelujah
[1:39:05] rebecca
[1:39:06] esther all of them my brother and sister
[1:39:08] it applies to you and i god didn't say
[1:39:11] well that was just for her but we can
[1:39:13] take that principle
[1:39:14] we can apply it to our life and we can
[1:39:17] see the good gifts of god
[1:39:18] unfold right before us amen they were
[1:39:21] for every bride
[1:39:22] and every true servant of god that sent
[1:39:25] out has got a whole book
[1:39:26] full of divine promises that he can
[1:39:28] offer to the bride
[1:39:30] i'm so glad of that he's got gifts in
[1:39:32] there for her
[1:39:33] he will not hold any of them back he
[1:39:35] will give every one of them freely as a
[1:39:37] true servant
[1:39:38] a model servant a servant that god can
[1:39:40] put trust in he won't try to hide it
[1:39:42] back from her
[1:39:44] because he knows that she is the
[1:39:47] oncoming
[1:39:48] queen hallelujah i can't tell you saints
[1:39:52] how much it is a privilege to
[1:39:54] me amen to be able to speak the word of
[1:39:57] god to you
[1:39:58] you are the oncoming queen you are the
[1:40:01] bride of jesus christ
[1:40:03] you are that one he has called he's
[1:40:05] lifted her up he said she's so beautiful
[1:40:08] everything about her is beautiful to him
[1:40:11] he's adorned her in robes of
[1:40:13] righteousness
[1:40:14] he has called her perfect he has laid
[1:40:17] the
[1:40:17] the path before her made the rough way
[1:40:20] smooth amen
[1:40:21] he is our provider hallelujah because
[1:40:25] he anointed the word to be preached to
[1:40:27] the oncoming queen
[1:40:29] and what a privilege to be able to stand
[1:40:32] one day saints and i say this from my
[1:40:34] heart
[1:40:34] to stand before god one day and be
[1:40:37] identified with you
[1:40:39] not the other way around where you would
[1:40:41] say oh we're just so glad we're
[1:40:42] identified with our pastor
[1:40:43] no no no i'm telling you the other way
[1:40:45] around the pastor said the word says the
[1:40:47] pastor's a servant

[1:41:32] the eyes of god

[1:41:36] would never have been open to us
[1:41:39] if god had not found favor
[1:41:42] with you he says he hides it
[1:41:46] from the eyes and the ears the minds
[1:41:50] of the wise and the prudent
[1:41:54] he says you know what i kept their eyes
[1:41:56] closed lest they would hear
[1:41:57] and they would see and then i would have
[1:41:59] to save them
[1:42:02] see that could easily be you and i that
[1:42:04] god said i'll just close your eyes in
[1:42:06] your ears
[1:42:07] so i don't even have to bother saving
[1:42:08] you
[1:42:12] but no we found favor
[1:42:15] and god says i'm going to open your eyes
[1:42:18] i'm going to open your ears
[1:42:20] i want you to see who you are
[1:42:25] oh this is not some cultish kind of
[1:42:27] thing like you've got to have the secret

[1:42:46] called of almighty god
[1:42:48] it's not my brother and sister or some
[1:42:50] man in command but it's the holy ghost
[1:42:53] it's god himself that's bringing the
[1:42:56] word and revealing this word and
[1:42:58] making it so that we recognize
[1:43:01] how we found favor look at mary my
[1:43:04] brother and sister just a reference here

[1:46:40] in the colosseum tore apart
[1:46:42] by wild animal and the one who lived
[1:46:46] through it all
[1:46:46] in a cave in the wilderness
[1:46:48] [Music]
[1:46:50] seemed like a disparity go read your
[1:46:53] history
[1:46:54] [Music]
[1:46:58] many of those testified before they went
[1:47:00] in the colosseum
[1:47:02] [Music]
[1:47:04] i can't tell you exactly where to go to
[1:47:06] read this but i've read it
[1:47:08] there would be those that opened the
[1:47:10] gates
[1:47:12] and the lions started to come out
[1:47:15] and their hands went up and they was
[1:47:16] like oh lord
[1:47:19] thank you witnesses in the roman
[1:47:22] coliseums looking down at people
[1:47:24] that weren't looking at lions they were
[1:47:27] looking
[1:47:28] oh lord jesus we're so happy to see you
[1:47:33] oh lord and they're looking up and the
[1:47:36] lions come and tear them asunder
[1:47:38] and people are what's wrong with them
[1:47:41] i'll tell you what was wrong with them
[1:47:43] they were already making their heavenly
[1:47:45] ascent amen
[1:47:47] oh just stephen could be there and
[1:47:50] they're stoning him bludgeoning him with
[1:47:51] them rocks
[1:47:52] and he's already lifting his hands and
[1:47:54] praising god he's looking beyond the
[1:47:56] veil
[1:47:59] but let me counter that for you there
[1:48:02] were those
[1:48:03] with the same confession of faith that
[1:48:05] god ordained to carry the seed
[1:48:08] through the dark ages history already
[1:48:12] shows them also
[1:48:13] and i don't preach this with emotion
[1:48:15] saying so i just wanted to start reality
[1:48:17] of what god would choose for you and i
[1:48:19] and we submit to god's will and there
[1:48:22] were those though oh they never had to
[1:48:23] go to a colosseum
[1:48:24] they never had to look a wild animal in
[1:48:26] the face but they laid
[1:48:28] in the caves cold and in starvation
[1:48:34] but god ordained them to carry the seed
[1:48:37] through laodicea i mean through the dark
[1:48:39] ages
[1:48:40] amen brother brown says that seed had to
[1:48:43] go back to the ground again
[1:48:45] hallelujah he used them saints my i
[1:48:48] don't know
[1:48:48] saints i don't know which is better i
[1:48:50] don't know what we're anointed to
[1:48:51] i do know this the prophet of god said
[1:48:53] for it all blows up we're out of here
[1:48:56] hallelujah i'll stand on that that's
[1:48:58] what i believe in
[1:49:00] but if god chose you to stand for the
[1:49:02] rest of time
[1:49:04] [Music]
[1:49:07] i don't know which one's better go
[1:49:10] quickly at the
[1:49:11] swipe of the paw of a lion
[1:49:15] or starving freezing in a cave
[1:49:19] hidden in the backside of a desert
[1:49:22] i do know this whatever god has called
[1:49:25] me for
[1:49:26] he has equipped me for and he has
[1:49:29] anointed me for
[1:49:31] and i will do it
[1:49:34] can we just stand and give a little
[1:49:36] praise to the lord today
[1:49:38] hallelujah what is this saints this is
[1:49:41] the
[1:49:42] influence of god in you amen that you
[1:49:45] will
[1:49:45] stand the time of decision it doesn't
[1:49:48] matter what is put before you
[1:49:50] there's a time of decision says i'm
[1:49:52] gonna stand
[1:49:53] hallelujah oh hallelujah
[1:49:56] thank you lord jesus amen
[1:50:00] now this might seem a little
[1:50:01] counter-intuitive but as i was studying
[1:50:03] my brother and sister this song kept
[1:50:05] coming to me
[1:50:06] and i'm going to sing it because there's
[1:50:08] something in my heart that is reaching
[1:50:10] out for that
[1:50:11] and i believe it with all of my heart
[1:50:14] hallelujah

[1:50:40] church website
[1:50:42] brother brown was speaking brother
[1:50:43] ryan's talking about you being blessed
[1:50:45] materially god but talk no he's not
[1:50:48] ashamed to say you know i hope god
[1:50:49] blesses you
[1:50:50] with these things what's the greater
[1:50:53] blessing
[1:50:55] what's the greater blessing oh i tell
[1:50:58] you what

[1:53:01] carry me home
[1:53:04] a man
[1:53:16] [Music]
[1:53:37] you know saints if the church
[1:53:40] in her deliverance from egypt
[1:53:42] [Music]
[1:53:46] had the revelation that she thought she
[1:53:48] had
[1:53:49] [Music]
[1:53:50] catch this if she had the revelation
[1:53:54] that she thought she had
[1:53:57] when they come down to the red sea
[1:54:00] they would have never stopped moving
[1:54:04] they'd have walked right into that and
[1:54:06] god would have said that's
[1:54:08] my children and he departed that water
[1:54:11] right in front of them
[1:54:14] but god in his permissive will said okay
[1:54:17] they're going to have to learn this
[1:54:18] lesson and i'm going to destroy the
[1:54:20] egyptians
[1:54:23] you realize the egyptians had no more
[1:54:26] red sea than israel did
[1:54:29] so they'd have deliverance if they'd
[1:54:31] just walked right down in the red sea it
[1:54:32] would have opened right in front of them
[1:54:34] they'd have walked right across the
[1:54:36] egyptians were to come to the red sea
[1:54:38] and they'd had no way to have got across
[1:54:42] they'd have still been vanquished of
[1:54:44] their enemy
[1:54:46] don't stop walking saints i don't care
[1:54:50] you walk down in your red sea and it
[1:54:52] gets right up here to your nose
[1:54:55] amen you just declare it's god's word
[1:54:57] and keep walking
[1:54:59] hallelujah because god don't make no
[1:55:01] mistakes

[1:55:05] of his ways
