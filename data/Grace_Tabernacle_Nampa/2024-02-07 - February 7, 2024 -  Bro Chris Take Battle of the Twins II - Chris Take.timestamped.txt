[37:50] it's good to see each one of you tonight
[37:52] good to be
[37:54] here amen if you have your Bibles and
[37:56] you want to stand with
[37:58] me we're going to turn over to Psalms
[38:03] 102 and
[38:05] um tonight I wanted to um take part two
[38:11] of Battle of the
[38:13] Twins and uh with the subtitle written
[38:18] for our
[38:19] sakes so Psalms
[38:22] 102 verse
[38:25] 16
[38:27] when the Lord shall build up Zion he
[38:29] shall appear in his glory he will regard
[38:33] the prayer of the destitute and not
[38:35] despise their
[38:37] prayer this shall be written for the
[38:39] generation to come and the people which
[38:42] shall be created shall praise the Lord
[38:45] for he hath looked down from the height
[38:47] of his Sanctuary from Heaven did the
[38:49] Lord behold the Earth to hear the
[38:52] groaning of the prisoner to loose those
[38:54] that are appointed to death to to
[38:56] declare the name of the Lord in Zion and
[38:59] his praise in
[39:01] Jerusalem then this scripture from
[39:03] Romans 15 verse4 for whatsoever things
[39:06] were written the four time were written
[39:08] for our learning that we through
[39:10] patience and comfort of the scriptures
[39:13] might have hope may the Lord bless the
[39:15] reading of his word you can be seated
[39:22] tonight
[39:23] so I had some different thoughts
[39:27] kind of this way and that way and and uh
[39:31] I just can't get away from from this
[39:33] this um this channel because if you look
[39:37] down we have Cain and and Abel um we
[39:42] have Adam and the serpent we have Cain
[39:44] and Abel we have in heaven last time we
[39:46] spoke a battle of the of the twins we
[39:48] talked about the origin of sin and
[39:50] righteousness and so you brother says
[39:53] sin started in heaven so you had Lucifer
[39:56] and and and and and God Adam and the
[39:59] serpent Cain and Abel Abraham and lot
[40:03] Noah and the rest of the world Esau and
[40:06] Jacob Israel and Moab and so on and down
[40:09] through through the the scriptures down
[40:12] through history you have this battle of
[40:14] the Twins and and every day that we we
[40:16] live our
[40:19] lives we are in a battle because we have
[40:23] the spirit man that's been Sanctified
[40:25] and filled with the Holy Spirit and we
[40:27] have the Flesh and so I I I mentioned it
[40:31] maybe last time and and that we we we
[40:35] look at the Flesh and and many times we
[40:37] we talk about the Flesh and and we and
[40:40] we and we say hey we want to drop the
[40:43] Robes of Flesh and and that's our
[40:45] heart's desire and that is a pure
[40:47] desire and as long as we keep that in
[40:49] Balance we're good but if we start to
[40:52] look at it as
[40:54] though if I didn't have the flesh then I
[40:57] could if I didn't have the flesh then I
[41:00] wouldn't then we've gone a little bit
[41:03] too far and we've forgotten we've become
[41:06] the victim rather than the Victor right
[41:09] very cliche I know but if we if we keep
[41:13] the right balance in our minds that we
[41:15] need our
[41:17] flesh we need the opposition think about
[41:22] gravity right we need the pulling
[41:25] against gravity so we can stand upright
[41:29] there's got to be these forces that that
[41:32] come against each other think about
[41:34] magnets and how all of that work it's
[41:36] two oppos you got a opposite and a
[41:38] negative right those two go
[41:40] together husband and wife you know I was
[41:42] reading this thing the other day my wife
[41:45] sent me and um this man is a Christian
[41:48] he's a I don't know marriage counselor
[41:50] or something and he's he's basically
[41:52] making the point that you know
[41:53] compatible according to the world is way
[41:55] far off off of it he loves to to to hike
[41:59] and get outside and she can't stand
[42:00] leaving the house and and and back and
[42:02] forth It's because each side then has
[42:05] something to surrender to make the
[42:07] relationship work in harmony each side
[42:09] is balancing the other so you can't have
[42:13] the middle of the road unless you have
[42:14] the right ditch and the left ditch there
[42:16] there would be no Middle Road if there
[42:19] wasn't the far so you have this and and
[42:21] this is something that you know through
[42:23] history because all religions are just
[42:24] the perversion of the truth
[42:26] and this is something that even even um
[42:29] they have picked up on and and it's it's
[42:32] like I said before the flesh is chaos
[42:35] but the order of the spirit of God keeps
[42:37] the flesh controlled but it has to have
[42:41] opposition you need opposition in and so
[42:45] this in um Psalms here I just wanted to
[42:48] highlight this is this scripture this
[42:49] shall be written for the generations to
[42:51] come and so you know I I was thinking to
[42:54] to bring this scripture and to show you
[42:55] how how it ties in I was thinking about
[42:58] um you can do a lot of good thinking
[43:00] when you're running early morning I I
[43:02] took brother David's advice I brave the
[43:04] scary woods in the dark um great great
[43:08] thoughts and so I was thinking about you
[43:10] know the different in the scriptures how
[43:11] we had the principles of the Gospel
[43:13] right because in in in um in society we
[43:17] have all this stuff about be kind right
[43:19] and and it just doesn't come off right
[43:21] and and so I I thought a lot about that
[43:23] and put thought into that and we have
[43:25] the we have the fruits of the spirit
[43:27] right Temperance and and all of these
[43:28] things that's the one I only one I can
[43:30] remember right now for some reason um
[43:33] but and so God gives us principles in
[43:36] the scriptures and I I think I'm a
[43:39] little bit too analytical sometimes for
[43:41] my own good but why do we have stories
[43:44] why do we need stories in the Bible if
[43:46] the Bible is is the principles for us to
[43:48] live by why do we need stories you know
[43:51] this man went out and fought this battle
[43:53] and came back and and I saw I was
[43:56] I know crazy this is how my mind is
[43:58] going and and I and it was because God
[44:00] says look he says the stories of the men
[44:05] and women in the Bible they're for us
[44:07] they are the principles of the book
[44:10] lived out so God says here's the Ten
[44:13] Commandments and then he puts into the
[44:16] book the stories of the children of
[44:18] Israel and the terrible things they did
[44:19] and all the the Kings and and and all of
[44:22] the men down through history that are in
[44:24] the book CU there's lots of History
[44:25] that's not the book he puts those there
[44:28] to say here's the principles and this is
[44:30] how it looks when you live it because if
[44:33] we get to literal we become legalistic
[44:35] and if we get to loose we become liberal
[44:38] that's right so God says here's what it
[44:40] looks like you know we have we have
[44:43] Peter and everything that he did and and
[44:46] and David and what he did but God says
[44:48] this is what I'm talking about this is
[44:51] your example and then and then and so on
[44:54] from there so the words written are were
[44:57] were for us you know they they are not
[44:59] complete without us why because we
[45:01] needed them for the book to be written
[45:04] and then we needed the book to be
[45:07] reunited with Christ so it's this big
[45:10] loop right and the only the only way
[45:14] what's if you read about job what story
[45:17] is in is in the book you know hey job
[45:20] from the beginning of time God said look
[45:22] job's going to be in the book okay so
[45:23] the scribes said all right
[45:26] so God said okay what are we what are we
[45:27] going to do to get job in the
[45:30] book and God said hey satan what you
[45:33] have you been up to oh going here and
[45:36] hither to or here uh back and forth
[45:38] whatever he says and have you considered
[45:41] job he he puts a Target on job's back
[45:44] and and the story of Job for for for
[45:49] centuries has
[45:51] inspired men and women of Faith but what
[45:55] do we read about him him we only read
[45:57] his story when he faces
[46:01] opposition that's it once his life is
[46:04] back to normal there's no more about him
[46:05] in the book that's
[46:07] right this shall be written for the
[46:09] generation to come it was put in the
[46:12] book but he had to have
[46:16] opposition he it it was it was necessary
[46:20] for his development that's right you
[46:22] know a child they have to oppose gravity
[46:25] learn how to walk and they fall down and
[46:28] it's and it's you know I'm glad we can't
[46:31] remember that um and then they walk but
[46:34] then how do we
[46:36] grow we we we oppose bacteria bad
[46:40] bacteria we we oppose our immune system
[46:43] opposes sickness our our our our we you
[46:46] know whatever it would be we it's it's
[46:50] what keeps this thing moving in Harmony
[46:54] and if that's true in the natur natural
[46:56] and that is true in the spiritual the
[46:58] flesh is necessary for our Perfection
[47:01] that is why God had that's what that's
[47:05] because that's part of his Plan of
[47:06] Redemption that's why he had to let the
[47:09] Garden of Eden fall happen he needed his
[47:13] children to have an
[47:16] opposition to bring his plan to
[47:18] fruition we we are here for one purpose
[47:21] and that is to fight the battle to fight
[47:24] the battle of the twins
[47:27] to take the
[47:30] battles sorry sometimes there's notes in
[47:33] there and then they don't belong
[47:37] anymore you know this is this is a
[47:40] battle that we're in as I've
[47:44] said and we we face it every day okay
[47:49] and it and it's and it's completely
[47:54] necessary and it and we have to stop
[47:57] tripping up on our
[48:00] failures sometimes there are C in a
[48:03] battle sometimes there's casualties on
[48:05] the good gu
[48:07] side but that doesn't mean they lost
[48:09] look at how many men gave their lives on
[48:11] the beaches of Normandy and that was
[48:13] just one battle yet we beat Hitler we
[48:16] beat the Nazis so sometimes we get so
[48:21] focused on the fact that you know
[48:23] imagine two soldiers in in a in a
[48:25] Foxhole and they're fighting and this
[48:28] guy dies nothing he can do he's boom
[48:31] instantly taken out of the fight if if
[48:33] if I'm the soldier that survived if I go
[48:35] oh my goodness and I just spend the next
[48:37] few minutes lamenting over this man I
[48:39] will join
[48:42] him now that is not don't take that as
[48:45] from you to your brother right but that
[48:47] is you that is your that is you and
[48:51] yourself and and and when you there's a
[48:54] battle lost if you just focus on the
[48:56] Lost battle you're going to get hit
[48:59] again if you're in a fight you get hit
[49:02] the first thing you do is bring back up
[49:04] so you can see your opponent and when
[49:06] you're fighting this battle look it
[49:08] doesn't have to
[49:10] be you know it's just we're just human
[49:12] beings and we have to fight this our
[49:15] desires to get upset and all this kind
[49:17] of stuff and and when we face that we
[49:19] get angry we face it we keep on going we
[49:22] don't sit there and tear ourselves down
[49:24] then all we're doing is accomplish in
[49:25] the enemy's job for him but if we say
[49:28] look hey I needed that opposition I
[49:30] failed that time but next time I'm going
[49:32] to do this differently then we're on the
[49:34] journey to Perfection at Thy word Lord I
[49:38] believe the Apostle said that our trials
[49:40] are better than gold to us so we we are
[49:43] as gold tried in the fire right we we we
[49:45] love that we love that analogy
[49:52] and so there's no Gold without the the
[49:56] fires we there's you can't
[49:59] just well let's just read the quote
[50:01] think of that God might have let you get
[50:03] sick in order that you might be a
[50:05] testimony that he might heal you that
[50:07] you can stand on his word
[50:09] so it's your personal experiences okay
[50:14] so then when you when you reach the
[50:16] opposition you can say I know beyond any
[50:18] Shadow of Doubt oh my witness to me in
[50:21] Jerusalem Judea Samaria a witness is
[50:24] somebody who's really done something
[50:25] something been somewhere and seen
[50:27] something so it's necessary you say I
[50:29] want a testimony it's necessary for a
[50:32] testimony for there to be opposition
[50:34] that's right it's necessary that there
[50:36] is a battle fought because look you
[50:38] cannot have a battle that's right
[50:42] without I have it at the end of the
[50:43] slides we'll see it but you can't have a
[50:45] battle without opposition you can't have
[50:47] a battle without without a fight and you
[50:50] can't have Victory without a struggle
[50:54] amen and and and those victories you
[50:57] know character is a victory right the
[50:59] only way to move up in as a child of God
[51:02] the only way to to come higher in Christ
[51:05] is to face another opposition so we say
[51:09] oh if you're not in a trial you're in
[51:10] between you're coming out of one or
[51:12] you're going into one that's a good
[51:15] thing that's a good thing good men make
[51:19] good times good times make weak men weak
[51:23] men make bad times look at the world
[51:25] around us we're living it today why was
[51:28] it the Great Depression World Wars all
[51:31] of those and the men that came out of
[51:33] that were entrepreneurs were're strong
[51:35] we're we resilient we're you know got up
[51:38] and went to work anyways you know
[51:41] they're the they're the they're the
[51:42] generation that you know never missed
[51:43] the day of work in 25 years though they
[51:45] were sick this that the
[51:47] other now we're having a mentally tough
[51:50] day we get a whole week
[51:52] off I'm sorry it's never going going to
[51:55] be easy that's right it's not but if you
[51:59] can I think you get the point but I
[52:01] don't feel like you get the point so I'm
[52:02] going to just labor this more because if
[52:06] with if you can look at it and say okay
[52:09] I need that right why do we go lift
[52:10] weights what are we going to do if we
[52:12] could lift nothing we would just lift
[52:15] nothing and then have muscle but we go
[52:18] and we lift something we we we we we get
[52:20] resistance easy Brother David we get
[52:23] resistance right we we have to have that
[52:26] and as soon as it gets easy guess what
[52:29] you can Titus I don't know how much you
[52:31] can squat I don't know if you've
[52:32] squatted on a under a bar before but
[52:34] let's say you get up to 135 pounds which
[52:37] is two
[52:37] plates and you do that and that's all
[52:40] you do you'll be strong for
[52:42] 135 but unless you add more resistance
[52:46] you will not get stronger that's right
[52:49] so you see the the the the the the the
[52:52] uh secret ingredient to your success in
[52:55] your Christian
[52:57] Life is another opposition overcome amen
[53:01] another step and sometimes we we try to
[53:04] bring it and we say well I want to lift
[53:06] 450 PBS so then you know sorry I I work
[53:11] out so this is the analogies but you
[53:13] want to do deadlifts Cas to pull the bar
[53:14] off the ground right there's some weight
[53:16] on the bar Titus is like look I want to
[53:17] live 450 if he goes to the gym puts 450
[53:20] on the bar starting right now and just
[53:22] tries every day to pull on that he can
[53:24] try and says you know I might not lift
[53:26] it today and try and try and try and he
[53:28] will never lift
[53:29] it because you have to be given a load
[53:32] you can handle that puts you right on
[53:35] the
[53:36] edge four to six reps right on the edge
[53:40] so it's hard it's really hard but it's
[53:43] not impossible as soon as you cross that
[53:45] threshold where it's too impossible you
[53:47] know what happens you get hurt and if
[53:49] you get hurt you're not going to lift
[53:51] anything cuz you're hurt so God knows
[53:54] exactly the right of amount of
[53:56] opposition to give you that is why the
[53:58] scripture says he will not tempt you
[54:00] above that which you can handle
[54:01] temptation is just the let's replace
[54:05] that word if I can have the Liberty to
[54:06] do so he will not give you a challenge
[54:09] you cannot handle that's
[54:12] right what a what a concept especially
[54:15] when you see it lived out in people like
[54:17] Corey tinboom and her family but God
[54:20] knew they could handle that and God knew
[54:23] they needed that because if I get
[54:25] Michael Michael can lift some heavy
[54:26] weights and I gave him my
[54:29] weights he'll get
[54:31] weak because he's a stronger
[54:34] man sometimes and not to say stronger in
[54:36] faith but sometimes the the way
[54:38] different people are you take you take a
[54:40] strong men they're strong men
[54:42] competitors they were actually born that
[54:44] way the average guy cannot just go and
[54:46] start competing in strong men
[54:48] competitions you're born that way you're
[54:50] you're big you're tall and your body
[54:52] just grows muscle
[54:55] you they have to have the big weights
[54:58] they can't have the little ones or
[54:59] they'll die they'll get weak and frail
[55:01] where if you try to tackle them you
[55:04] understand the analogy so God gives you
[55:06] what you need to take because it's the
[55:08] opposition that makes you stronger in
[55:10] your faith witnessed to me in Jerusalem
[55:13] okay been somewhere and seen something
[55:15] so you've gone there You' lived through
[55:20] that now you have a
[55:22] testimony our hope is in God if you
[55:25] would have lived in the days gone by
[55:26] when they crucified Jesus you'd say
[55:28] today I would have stood for him I'd
[55:30] have given my life for him you have more
[55:33] of an opportunity to do that now than
[55:35] you would have in them days stand now
[55:38] the opposition is greater today than it
[55:40] was then why is it
[55:43] Greater because we have the whole thing
[55:47] amen so now we're the strong men we have
[55:51] all of that we have we have the the all
[55:54] the whole package so if God said okay
[55:57] I'm going to give you the Temptations of
[55:59] age number four the fourth
[56:02] age you would never come to
[56:05] Perfection you're too strong for that
[56:08] you say what Martyrs dying lying yeah
[56:12] now it's all in the mind that's right
[56:15] how what's the what's the most what's
[56:17] some of the
[56:19] best torture tactics the mind that's
[56:23] right the devil knows because the devil
[56:26] anoints those people the devil knows if
[56:28] he can get in your mind he's got you he
[56:31] doesn't even have to lay a finger on
[56:33] your body that's
[56:35] right if he can if you were saying your
[56:38] head I'm defeated guess what you're
[56:42] defeated but God has given us the
[56:45] Perfection of his word the whole thing
[56:49] and he says look you're ready now it's
[56:53] opposition is greater day because it has
[56:56] to be not that it's like wow God oh my
[56:59] goodness the burden no it is completely
[57:02] and totally necessary because we are
[57:06] here preparing for a crossing over
[57:10] whether that comes through death or that
[57:12] that comes through the rapture we are
[57:13] preparing for a crossing over and we
[57:16] will come to that place when we are
[57:21] ready if a man if somebody wants to go
[57:24] compete in competition they have to
[57:26] train for that
[57:28] competition we cannot sit on the next to
[57:32] on the right hand of God in heaven as
[57:35] his bride until we have completed our
[57:37] training amen so then it's necessary for
[57:41] us to consume all of the nutrition we
[57:44] possibly can and and to take advantage
[57:46] of all the time that we can in the days
[57:49] that were given to train that's
[57:52] righten you see there's there's two
[57:54] definitions
[57:55] there's exercise and there's training
[57:58] exercise is when you just go for a walk
[58:00] and you know do that every day that's
[58:02] healthy it's good for your body that's
[58:04] just exercise but training is when you
[58:07] increase resistance over time and you
[58:11] have a goal you're working towards we're
[58:13] not here just to exercise denominations
[58:16] are full of people who are just
[58:17] exercising the good principles of the
[58:19] book we are here to
[58:22] train as Warriors of the faith we're not
[58:25] it's not a cliche and you know what
[58:26] motivation doesn't get you very far it's
[58:30] discipline and discipline is
[58:33] chastisement chastisement isn't because
[58:35] you're doing something wrong it's God
[58:38] training you it's God challenging you
[58:41] that's
[58:42] right because God has promised
[58:45] believer's position in Christ God has
[58:47] promised he would do it see and I
[58:49] believe him and so when opposition comes
[58:51] why it's not me to take care of it it's
[58:53] him to take care of it it's just me to
[58:55] go wherever he said go that's right he
[58:58] will take care of the opposition so now
[59:00] say brother Chris you've completely cont
[59:02] contradicted yourself because God takes
[59:04] care of the
[59:06] opposition here in lies the greatest
[59:11] struggle in in in fighting against the
[59:13] opposition that we are given we must
[59:16] give him complete control that's right
[59:20] and that's the hardest part right you
[59:22] have to trust the process you know many
[59:25] many people in the day and age we live
[59:27] in they have a goal they want to do
[59:28] something they want to climb to the top
[59:29] of Everest they have to trust the
[59:31] process if they don't trust the process
[59:34] surrender to the process and three
[59:36] months in they still can't they're still
[59:38] not where they want to
[59:40] be and they change it and they go over
[59:43] here and they go over here they will get
[59:45] nowhere they have to surrender Amen to
[59:48] the process amen sometimes we say hey
[59:52] I'm going to I'm going to do this we
[59:53] have a we have a train
[59:55] you know as Christians we have a
[59:56] training we're going to we we got we
[59:58] know what we have to do so we get up and
[1:00:01] we say we come to we come to a session
[1:00:04] of training and we say all right ah I
[1:00:07] don't know maybe this isn't working I
[1:00:09] got to change it we put our heads down
[1:00:11] we say no we just want to change it
[1:00:14] because it's hard but it's the right
[1:00:17] thing to do it's the right thing to do
[1:00:20] remember the analogy I gave o of of the
[1:00:23] man going to prayer and he brought along
[1:00:25] will his
[1:00:27] self-will you remember
[1:00:29] that I'll give it again so the other day
[1:00:32] I heard this from somebody else but the
[1:00:35] day I went to prayer and I looked at
[1:00:38] will my will and I said today is it's
[1:00:42] it's time for prayer are you ready to go
[1:00:44] and he said I am if you
[1:00:46] are says okay so we gathered the
[1:00:50] emotions and we went to prayer and the
[1:00:52] whole time I had to go get the emotions
[1:00:54] he was was off playing golf and this
[1:00:55] emotion was off plowing the field and I
[1:00:57] had to go catch this emotion cuz he was
[1:00:59] down at the gym and this emotion was
[1:01:01] over there with his nose in a fiction
[1:01:03] novel and it was a wreck and if you
[1:01:04] would asked me did I enjoy myself I
[1:01:06] would have had an answer honestly no but
[1:01:10] then it came again for time for prayer
[1:01:12] and I looked to will and I said will are
[1:01:13] you ready to go to prayer and he said I
[1:01:16] am if you are so we went to prayer
[1:01:18] dragging emotions along with us and it
[1:01:20] was a battle as ever before and if you
[1:01:22] would have asked me after the time of
[1:01:24] prayer if I had any fun or if I enjoyed
[1:01:26] it I would have had to answer honestly
[1:01:28] no but then it came time for a prayer
[1:01:31] again and I looked at will and will said
[1:01:33] I'm ready if you are and we drug
[1:01:35] emotions along and this went on for a
[1:01:36] couple of weeks and then one day I I
[1:01:38] looked to will and I said all right will
[1:01:40] it's time let's go and we went to drag
[1:01:43] emotions along again but before we could
[1:01:44] move from the room the emotions looked
[1:01:46] to one of the emotions looked to the
[1:01:48] others and said you know what he's going
[1:01:49] to take us anyways we might as well just
[1:01:51] go along so my emotions came along now
[1:01:55] they didn't really pay attention too
[1:01:56] well but it was a little bit better than
[1:01:58] the time before couple more weeks went
[1:02:00] by and I looked at will and I said will
[1:02:03] you ready to go to Prayer Will said I'm
[1:02:04] ready if you are and I went to prayer
[1:02:06] and something happened one of the
[1:02:09] Motions got a little excited and jumped
[1:02:11] up and said Hallelujah and the rest said
[1:02:13] amen and if you would asked me did I
[1:02:15] enjoy myself afterward I would have said
[1:02:17] yes I had the best prayer time of my
[1:02:20] life you see our emotions should be
[1:02:23] ruled by by us amen our emotions are
[1:02:27] always going to be there but we have to
[1:02:30] look will face to face and say are we
[1:02:32] going to do
[1:02:33] this and where do we get that
[1:02:36] strength he will take care of the
[1:02:39] opposition where do we get that strength
[1:02:41] to say I'm going to get out of bed and
[1:02:42] do what God has called me to do because
[1:02:44] he takes care of the opposition and we
[1:02:45] drag our emotions along whether they
[1:02:47] want to come or not we are in control
[1:02:50] and that only comes through discipline
[1:02:52] which is the chastisement of the the
[1:02:54] Lord because he loves you and me and he
[1:02:57] takes care of the opposition how so by
[1:03:00] training
[1:03:01] you by giving you what you need to
[1:03:04] overcome by feeding you to strengthen
[1:03:07] your
[1:03:08] faith but without faith it is impossible
[1:03:11] to please him for he that cometh to God
[1:03:14] must believe that he is and that he is a
[1:03:16] rewarder of them that diligently seek
[1:03:23] him
[1:03:25] in Hebrews 12
[1:03:27] 5-11 I'm looking at this chapter this is
[1:03:30] Hebrews 12 but Hebrews 11 I'm looking at
[1:03:32] that chapter totally different
[1:03:34] now why are those men in that chapter
[1:03:38] all of them faced
[1:03:40] opposition that's why they're there
[1:03:42] that's what faith is Faith is the coming
[1:03:45] face to face with opposition and by
[1:03:48] surrendering our will our emotions to
[1:03:52] Christ we Find Faith which gives us the
[1:03:56] victory because faith is a victory and
[1:03:58] you have forgotten the exhortation which
[1:04:00] speaketh unto you as unto children my
[1:04:03] son despise not thou the chastening of
[1:04:05] the Lord nor faint when thou art rebuked
[1:04:07] of him so chastening is training not
[1:04:12] just discipline it's training train up a
[1:04:14] child in the way he should go that does
[1:04:15] not just mean you you only talk to them
[1:04:18] and discipline them and train them when
[1:04:20] they're doing bad you encourage when
[1:04:22] they're doing good and you show them
[1:04:23] this is this is how you act and you and
[1:04:26] you talk to them you you you play
[1:04:28] offense you don't always play defense if
[1:04:29] all you do is play defense that's right
[1:04:32] you're just it's going to be it's not
[1:04:34] going to work out very well you're going
[1:04:35] to be lopsided so chastening is just
[1:04:38] training of the Lord nor faint when thou
[1:04:40] art rebuked of him see he separates the
[1:04:42] two for whom the Lord loveth he
[1:04:44] chasteneth or he trth and he scourges
[1:04:47] every son whom he receiveth if you
[1:04:50] endure chastening God dealth with you as
[1:04:52] with sons for what son is he whom the
[1:04:54] father chasteneth not but if you be
[1:04:57] without chastisement whereof all are
[1:04:59] partakers then are you bastards and not
[1:05:01] Sons so if there's no training right a
[1:05:04] neglected child receives no
[1:05:08] training so
[1:05:10] God isn't neglecting you and and this
[1:05:14] scripture comes about because I I don't
[1:05:17] want to focus on the rebuking part
[1:05:19] because sometimes we go through things
[1:05:21] and and if we're not careful the devil
[1:05:23] slips in in in his in his Sunday
[1:05:27] suit and he says uh you're doing
[1:05:30] something wrong so God's punishing you
[1:05:35] all the while God's just putting more
[1:05:36] plates on your bar making the lift
[1:05:39] harder amen and
[1:05:41] he loves you and he's just your trainer
[1:05:46] amen he's where the holy spirit is the
[1:05:49] inward teacher that's right or the
[1:05:52] trainer amen I know some people who who
[1:05:55] have you know trainers they those
[1:05:59] sometimes they hate their
[1:06:00] guts cuz they're putting more opposition
[1:06:05] to them right it's like that story for
[1:06:08] the Paul likes to share all the time
[1:06:09] about those Vietnam the platoon of
[1:06:11] Vietnam War uh soldiers they hat they
[1:06:14] couldn't stand that guy but because of
[1:06:17] the opposition he gave them they could
[1:06:19] go out in the jungle and it was easy so
[1:06:22] to speak right furthermore we have had
[1:06:24] fathers of our flesh which corrected us
[1:06:26] and we gave them reverence shall we not
[1:06:27] much rather be in subjection unto the
[1:06:29] father of spirits and live for they
[1:06:31] verily for a few days chastened us after
[1:06:34] their own pleasure but he for our profit
[1:06:37] that we might be partakers of his
[1:06:38] Holiness see there's the formula right
[1:06:43] there for our Prophet for job's Prophet
[1:06:48] all hell broke loose because God said
[1:06:52] job needs this
[1:06:55] job needs
[1:06:57] to 800 lb CU that was a big
[1:07:01] trial imagine losing all of your kids
[1:07:04] and everything you own right but that's
[1:07:08] what job needed that was the opposition
[1:07:10] he needed to reach the level God wanted
[1:07:13] him to be at you know all we hear about
[1:07:15] is Enoch walked with God and he was not
[1:07:18] what kind of opposition did Enoch have
[1:07:19] to deal with to get to that position
[1:07:22] that's right why is Enoch in the book so
[1:07:26] we know for the generations to come we
[1:07:30] know and that is why they are not
[1:07:31] perfect without me and you because they
[1:07:33] are the reason for the book we are the
[1:07:36] ones who needed it and we complete the
[1:07:38] picture amen for they verely for okay
[1:07:42] now no chastening for the present seeth
[1:07:44] to be joyous of course it's
[1:07:48] terrible but science has proven over and
[1:07:51] over and over again when you do a really
[1:07:52] hard thing after after that it's better
[1:07:56] than if you before am it
[1:08:00] takes excuse me it takes immense
[1:08:02] suffering to enjoy peace that's right it
[1:08:06] takes hardship and and sweat and and and
[1:08:09] and pain to
[1:08:12] enjoy
[1:08:16] peace and then the next battle comes
[1:08:20] that's what it takes it's not joy in the
[1:08:22] moment but God but Christ who came down
[1:08:25] and endured the
[1:08:28] most endured what he endured on the
[1:08:31] cross why did he do it CU he looked and
[1:08:34] he could see and that's where people
[1:08:36] begin to find success in their training
[1:08:38] is they look and they they can suddenly
[1:08:41] the goal is before them it was always
[1:08:43] before them in in writing it was always
[1:08:45] before them in their in their plan but
[1:08:47] this time they catch a revelation of the
[1:08:49] goal and that keeps them training that
[1:08:51] keeps them getting up at 4 in the
[1:08:53] morning morning or or staying up late or
[1:08:55] or running in the rain or or or hurting
[1:08:58] in pain because they have a revelation
[1:09:02] of the goal and we as Sons and Daughters
[1:09:05] of God if we can catch what those in the
[1:09:07] book caught where they said this is what
[1:09:09] I must attain to this is when look at
[1:09:12] Paul the end of his life where were
[1:09:14] where was where was he you know by
[1:09:17] himself please bring my coat and my my
[1:09:20] Scrolls dying
[1:09:22] alone for what
[1:09:24] he attained the goal amen you see it's
[1:09:27] not who's there what's there because you
[1:09:28] know what people who and I've said this
[1:09:30] before with the popet I know people who
[1:09:31] Run 100 miles nobody who does it because
[1:09:34] they want to make somebody else
[1:09:35] impressed or because they want the money
[1:09:37] anybody who starts the race like that
[1:09:39] doesn't finish it it's only those who
[1:09:42] run it who say I must conquer this
[1:09:45] they're the ones who
[1:09:47] finish it's only those who start the
[1:09:49] race not for Dad not for Mom not for the
[1:09:52] church not because some Somebody's
[1:09:54] Watching only those who start the race
[1:09:56] because they see who God is they see who
[1:09:58] Christ is they see what he's done and
[1:10:00] they say I want to be there I want to
[1:10:03] attain the goal it's those who can face
[1:10:05] the opposition amen because it's a
[1:10:08] revelation
[1:10:09] right and that's the key but Grievious
[1:10:13] nevertheless afterward it yieldeth the
[1:10:15] Peaceable fruit of righteousness oh I
[1:10:18] want to be righteous okay buckle on
[1:10:22] buckle on your armor you want be
[1:10:23] righteous you would to be a better man
[1:10:25] you want to be a better father Buckle in
[1:10:28] Hunker not hunker down but you know
[1:10:30] strap it in
[1:10:32] boy it yith peaceful fruit of
[1:10:34] righteousness unto them which are
[1:10:36] exercised thereby you
[1:10:39] see where I think Pentecost fell there
[1:10:42] it is when you're meeting really face to
[1:10:45] face with demon powers when you're
[1:10:48] meeting face to face with opposition
[1:10:50] there's where the testing time comes it
[1:10:52] Changs only its strongest at its weakest
[1:10:55] link that's right when you're face to
[1:10:58] face with opposition be sure that you
[1:11:00] know what you're talking about now you
[1:11:02] could get by with anything in America I
[1:11:04] went to a service here not long ago bear
[1:11:05] with me while I read this quotes a
[1:11:06] little bit lengthy but it makes the
[1:11:08] point perfectly where they was supposed
[1:11:10] to be practicing Divine Healing the
[1:11:12] fellow was jumping up and down screaming
[1:11:14] to the top of his voice kicking the
[1:11:15] pulpit as hard as he could saying God I
[1:11:17] demand you oh mercy I thought God be
[1:11:19] merciful to my brother he doesn't
[1:11:21] understand who are we to demand God to
[1:11:23] do anything he's already done it just
[1:11:25] believe him amen that's all see how did
[1:11:29] how did Brother Bram pray and I'm not
[1:11:31] making points anything else simply this
[1:11:33] point of how do was it God you this is
[1:11:37] your word this is your promise it's a
[1:11:38] faith you know there there's a there's a
[1:11:42] I can't remember the the
[1:11:45] culture I'm I'm going to butcher the
[1:11:47] name do I get it wrong but it's it's
[1:11:48] some kind of Eastern Europe northern
[1:11:50] eastern Europe kind of area these these
[1:11:52] people these men who who were known to
[1:11:53] be very strong and they lifted in
[1:11:56] silence they didn't even grunt they just
[1:11:58] lifted in silence they believed that a
[1:12:00] man should just take it and and lift it
[1:12:02] and didn't make a big deal about it they
[1:12:04] didn't shout they didn't crank music and
[1:12:06] they were known to be very strong so you
[1:12:08] know this is it you know this is what
[1:12:11] the word says so you just pray and you
[1:12:13] say
[1:12:14] God I believe it amen he had an old
[1:12:17] fellow in a sheet shaking him back and
[1:12:19] forth like this a man with a heart
[1:12:20] trouble I felt sorry for him now you can
[1:12:23] get excited right that happens but
[1:12:25] that's not what this guy's doing another
[1:12:27] man came up with rheumatism he shook
[1:12:29] that way and he hit him just as hard as
[1:12:31] he could with his hand and said I hate
[1:12:32] rheumatism that don't take Devil's Out
[1:12:36] the Devil don't care how much you hauler
[1:12:38] he's not hard of hearing but he
[1:12:40] certainly knows where Faith lays that's
[1:12:42] one thing that'll make him
[1:12:46] move right so this
[1:12:49] is this is it right
[1:12:52] here and know when it when it comes time
[1:12:55] did your did your training is your
[1:12:56] training where it needed to be then then
[1:13:00] you come to this PL place because you
[1:13:02] will and you do every day it might not
[1:13:04] be a demon of rheumatism or death or
[1:13:08] whatever but you come to face to face
[1:13:10] with these demons the desires of your
[1:13:13] flesh and it's and and it's the training
[1:13:16] that you have been the opposition that
[1:13:18] you have
[1:13:20] endured that trains you for the
[1:13:22] opposition your facing now which is
[1:13:24] going to train you for the next
[1:13:25] opposition that's
[1:13:28] right so if you fail this time don't
[1:13:33] worry get
[1:13:36] stronger there is no fight without
[1:13:38] opposition there is no Victory without
[1:13:41] the struggle amen you can't you you have
[1:13:43] to have the chaos of the world in order
[1:13:46] for you to be who you are destined to be
[1:13:49] for for who God has trained has has has
[1:13:53] what God's plan is for your life and
[1:13:56] that opposition comes in many different
[1:13:59] shapes and sizes and circumstances but
[1:14:03] it's tailor made to you it is your
[1:14:07] training program it's God's taken all
[1:14:11] the measurements of your body your
[1:14:13] muscle composition he's taken all those
[1:14:15] measurements and he says this is your
[1:14:16] plan for your life and when you step
[1:14:19] into it it's a challenge from day one
[1:14:24] but those who continually and
[1:14:26] consistently face the challenge you can
[1:14:28] be somebody who just faces The Challenge
[1:14:30] and faces the challenge you know and
[1:14:33] here and there and back and forth and
[1:14:34] you're not going to get anywhere like I
[1:14:35] said before but it's those who
[1:14:37] consistently face a challenge that
[1:14:38] increases the difficulty they are the
[1:14:41] ones that are going out and competing in
[1:14:43] the Olympics they are the ones who are
[1:14:45] reaching that point if they can do that
[1:14:47] in the
[1:14:48] natural spiritually what should we be
[1:14:50] coming to amen what should we need to
[1:14:54] embrace what's before us we need
[1:14:56] opposition it's not something we need to
[1:14:58] get rid of we need to embrace it we need
[1:15:01] to say
[1:15:03] opposition come here I need more
[1:15:06] faith you realize the world looks on us
[1:15:08] says that's
[1:15:09] ridiculous you want hardships in your
[1:15:11] life people ask why if God Loved You
[1:15:13] Then why is all this evil in the world
[1:15:15] this is why you need that opposition
[1:15:18] otherwise you'll be a weak Christian and
[1:15:21] if you avoid opposition and water on the
[1:15:24] gospel and you and you you don't say
[1:15:25] anything on the job you avoiding a
[1:15:28] chance to increase your
[1:15:31] faith God help us to embrace the
[1:15:35] opposition before us so that we can then
[1:15:39] receive a greater Faith because faith is
[1:15:41] what
[1:15:44] Revelation when we go through a battle
[1:15:46] when we Face a
[1:15:48] fight and we overcome that
[1:15:51] fight we are that that much stronger am
[1:15:56] and one
[1:15:57] day
[1:16:01] your
[1:16:03] soul this your spirit is going to get so
[1:16:06] perfect your body won't be able to hold
[1:16:08] you
[1:16:09] back that's what we're reaching forward
[1:16:12] to one day the coat won't fit anymore so
[1:16:16] you have to shed it for the new
[1:16:18] one that's the goal that's the pyramid
[1:16:21] that's the statue of a perfect man we
[1:16:24] need to outgrow this flesh but we need
[1:16:27] the flesh to outgrow cuz if we didn't
[1:16:30] have something to
[1:16:31] outgrow there would be no point amen
[1:16:35] let's bow our heads Heavenly Father Lord
[1:16:37] little short tonight but that's what
[1:16:40] you've laid on My
[1:16:41] Heart Lord it's easy to talk about it's
[1:16:44] a whole another ball game to put it into
[1:16:49] practice so Lord we ask you to please
[1:16:54] give us the strength give us the the
[1:16:57] discipline in our lives Lord Jesus to
[1:16:59] face the
[1:17:01] opposition and embrace it to embrace the
[1:17:05] the hardship embrace the trial embrace
[1:17:08] the weakness that we
[1:17:10] have to see your word overcome that
[1:17:13] embrace your word in a greater way to to
[1:17:15] see the weakness and to begin to go to
[1:17:18] the word to strengthen that to work
[1:17:21] against that to to oppose that to oppose
[1:17:25] the flesh to build our character for
[1:17:28] your
[1:17:29] kingdom Lord we we love you so much we
[1:17:32] know that that you you live this out
[1:17:37] perfectly your entire life on Earth 33

[1:17:41] years you
[1:17:44] refused to let go of the vision you had
[1:17:48] chances to marry and do all of these
[1:17:50] things but there was a goal there was a
[1:17:52] vision
[1:17:54] and you held to that Lord now we want to
