[36:10] Christ amen
[36:12] amen while you're standing if you turn
[36:15] your Bibles to Psalm 139
[36:18] I want to read that scripture we read
[36:20] last time I think it was last time I
[36:23] ministered
[36:25] and kind of carry a little further with
[36:27] that
[36:28] but it's not a part three or two or
[36:30] three it's just I want to title this
[36:33] tonight bride material
[36:36] bride material
[36:38] and with that that's the title but with
[36:42] that bride material the Eternal thoughts
[36:45] of God
[36:47] his redeemable thoughts the Eternal
[36:50] thoughts of God his redeemable thoughts
[36:55] amen Psalm 139 starting with verse 15.
[37:00] my substance
[37:02] we know that
[37:04] faith is the substance the Bible said
[37:06] now Faith is the substance of things
[37:09] hoped for the evidence of Things Not
[37:12] Seen
[37:14] amen
[37:16] for my substance was not hid from thee
[37:20] When I Was Made In Secret
[37:22] and curiously wrought in the lowest
[37:25] parts of the Earth
[37:26] Thine Eyes did see my substance yet
[37:29] being unperfect and in thy book all my
[37:34] members were written
[37:36] which in continuance were fashioned when
[37:40] yes yet there was none of them how
[37:43] precious also are thy thoughts unto me o
[37:46] God
[37:47] How great is the sum of them
[37:52] amen I'd like you to turn me to
[37:54] Philippians
[38:00] chapter 2
[38:06] I trust you prayed for the service and
[38:08] that you've asked God to speak to your
[38:10] hearts tonight
[38:12] we get in the busyness of the day and we
[38:15] need to take time out don't we
[38:18] Prophet said if we just get alone
[38:20] meditate upon God
[38:23] he said and and get our thoughts upon
[38:25] him he said we'd be a lot less nervous
[38:30] that's what he said we'd be a lot less
[38:31] nervous
[38:33] amen than we are amen amen all right so
[38:37] I pray that you prayed because I'm
[38:39] depending on him
[38:41] to speak
[38:42] amen I Know The Enemy would like to to
[38:45] fight this substance that was in God to
[38:48] begin with you know God spoke faith
[38:52] that's the substance we're speaking of
[38:54] when he thought of you and put it in
[38:55] word form
[38:57] amen
[38:59] then it was himself
[39:02] being manifest
[39:04] Philippians 2
[39:07] verse 5. let this mind
[39:11] be in you
[39:15] which was also in Christ Jesus let me
[39:19] read that again let this mind
[39:22] be in you
[39:24] which was also
[39:28] say mind
[39:30] was also in Christ Jesus
[39:35] who being in the form of God thought it
[39:38] not robbery to be equal with God
[39:43] bless his word he may be seated
[39:51] that word form in Philippians 2
[39:55] and 6.
[39:57] means amorphy
[40:01] that word form in that scripture there
[40:04] means in morphe let this mind be in you
[40:06] with who being in the form of God or in
[40:09] morphe it's the same God all the time
[40:13] just changing his form
[40:16] in morphe
[40:19] just changed or changing his mask
[40:24] to enact to an act which were in a great
[40:27] drama how many know were in the end time
[40:29] drama
[40:31] amen and we've arrived to the end time
[40:33] the prophet said the opening of the
[40:35] seals identified we were at the end time
[40:38] and we've arrived he said
[40:40] and it's the formation now so we see God
[40:43] in a form today
[40:46] amen
[40:47] we see we saw him in a form yesterday
[40:50] when he was manifesting Jesus Christ now
[40:53] he still manifests in Jesus Christ but
[40:56] in another form
[40:58] amen and so his word his thought his his
[41:02] form he changes his mask now as we we
[41:07] have it
[41:08] uh told to us in the message
[41:11] invisible union he said now it's God in
[41:15] Bride form
[41:18] amen not another God same God
[41:22] in Bride form
[41:24] the bride as he said in that message
[41:27] it's the bride coming he said of Christ
[41:31] amen it's the bride coming of Christ
[41:34] another portion without that you
[41:36] wouldn't have the full revelation of
[41:38] himself
[41:40] amen
[41:42] because we have to go right back to what
[41:43] it was
[41:45] in the beginning
[41:48] Eve was not another
[41:50] another uh
[41:53] she was another form but she was in
[41:55] another form of Adam
[41:57] it was Adam I should you want to reverse
[42:00] that it's Adam in another form
[42:03] it was Adam expressed in another form
[42:08] it was still a part of himself
[42:10] he was both male and female
[42:13] it was not another spirit that went into
[42:15] Eve it was his spirit
[42:18] amen
[42:19] it was it was it was not another it was
[42:22] not another flesh it was his flesh
[42:25] but in another form she was flesh of his
[42:29] flesh
[42:30] bone of his bone
[42:32] she was the mystery of Adam revealed
[42:35] she was the she was the Capstone of
[42:38] creation
[42:40] amen because Adam was without Adam was
[42:43] alone he would not good that man should
[42:45] be alone God was expressing himself
[42:49] and in him
[42:50] he had thoughts he had his heart purpose
[42:53] God's heart purpose was to have a bride
[42:56] of his own choosing
[42:57] that was his heart purpose we could just
[43:00] realize that statement that was God's
[43:02] heart purpose
[43:04] to have a bride of his own choosing
[43:07] so he said
[43:09] he said now so it's bride it's the bride
[43:12] coming of Christ and that's what the
[43:14] Bible has been it's been a work of God
[43:17] that's been covered up
[43:19] I just said my our my substance my
[43:22] substance was was hid
[43:25] or was it hid
[43:27] if my substance was he formed me he made
[43:30] me he doesn't make any junk he was I was
[43:32] fearfully and wonderfully made
[43:34] then when did he make my substance he
[43:36] had he had to express something
[43:39] and in our day that we live I'm getting
[43:42] a little head let's back up here so it
[43:44] was covered up and it's been hid since
[43:46] the foundation of the world
[43:49] the work of God's been covered up has
[43:51] been hid since the foundation of the
[43:53] world and and its Sevenfold what's been
[43:56] hid he said and that's what the Bible
[43:59] has been it's as the Bible has been the
[44:02] work of God that's been covered up
[44:05] now just stop and think about there's
[44:07] mystery in that word that God was was
[44:10] manif was speaking about through the
[44:12] word but it was still a hidden Mystery
[44:15] but it couldn't be unveiled until the
[44:17] Sevenfold mystery or the Seven Seals
[44:19] were opened
[44:21] and he said and he said it's and and
[44:24] it's been hid it's been hid the Bible's
[44:26] been hid since the foundation of the
[44:28] world and and that and that work of God
[44:31] and it's Sevenfold Mysteries been hid
[44:33] and God promised in this day
[44:37] he said at the age of this laodicean
[44:40] church he would take the mask off of the
[44:42] whole thing
[44:44] he would take the mask off of the whole
[44:46] thing
[44:48] and we could see it
[44:52] we would it would be unveiled to us we
[44:55] could who's we he's talking about he's
[44:57] talking about
[44:59] and let me just say this he's talking
[45:01] about watch carefully now and see this
[45:03] I'm quoting out of the church AIDS book
[45:05] The Bride was already in his mind
[45:08] before the foundation of the world
[45:10] before be when was God just an eternal
[45:13] he wasn't even God yet until he created
[45:15] something to worship him but he was
[45:17] eternal spirit
[45:19] and in him was what the bride was
[45:23] already in his mind and we covered last
[45:25] time I ministered yes she was she was
[45:27] existing because substances is something
[45:31] that's an actual existence that's
[45:33] substance
[45:35] so she was existing in his mind
[45:39] she was substance in him she wasn't a
[45:42] mess she was an imagination is something
[45:44] he had conceived that was a that was
[45:47] absolutely in his mind to be spoken
[45:50] amen amen and he had in order for it to
[45:53] come to Creation it had to be expressed
[45:57] amen and that's the word
[45:59] all right so so he said but but when it
[46:03] was just when it was just himself
[46:06] Eternal himself the bride was already in
[46:10] his mind
[46:11] yes she was she was existing in his
[46:15] thoughts she was substance
[46:19] because substance as I said let me just
[46:22] go back here that which has actual
[46:24] existence is the definition of substance
[46:28] that which has actual existence
[46:31] so she was existing in his thoughts and
[46:34] what about those thoughts of God they
[46:37] are Eternal are they not what about
[46:39] those thoughts
[46:41] they're Eternal are they not he said
[46:44] they are real
[46:47] he said they are real
[46:50] amen they're not they're not just
[46:52] something that that he imagined they are
[46:54] real they were existing they were living
[46:56] they were in him and he wanted to
[46:58] express himself
[47:00] amen
[47:01] amen so he said we he said the Eternal
[47:06] thoughts of God which were those Eternal
[47:09] thoughts we are those Eternal thoughts
[47:12] of his bride were the Eternal thoughts
[47:13] of God which were to be expressed in
[47:16] flesh in their due season
[47:20] or another place of prophesied in their
[47:22] decreed season well this is your decreed
[47:24] season
[47:25] you're here for one purpose
[47:28] that's to express
[47:30] God himself
[47:32] in the form that he said it would be in
[47:35] so who being in the form of God Amen let
[47:39] this mind be in you
[47:41] that was also in Christ Jesus who being
[47:43] in the form of God
[47:45] thought it not robbery to be equal with
[47:48] God
[47:50] amen now that's the bride
[47:54] amen that's him
[47:57] today
[47:59] all right
[48:00] you say you're getting pretty you're
[48:02] getting far out Brother David you're
[48:03] getting too deep no that's not too deep
[48:05] it just takes Revelation to see the
[48:06] Simplicity of it
[48:10] because when it's revealed to you it's
[48:12] more simple than you can imagine or even
[48:14] think about simplicity
[48:16] Simplicity is something that's revealed
[48:18] to you
[48:20] if it's going to be hit in you he hides
[48:22] himself in Simplicity and reveals
[48:25] himself out through the same
[48:27] all right so he so it's been hit
[48:29] something been hid
[48:31] and God promised in this day that the
[48:34] mask would be taken off and we could see
[48:37] it so who's we those Eternal thoughts of
[48:39] God
[48:41] what a glorious thing God in morphe mask
[48:44] in a pillar of fire god A morphy and A
[48:46] Man Called Jesus God in morphe in his
[48:49] church
[48:51] God above us God With Us God in us the
[48:53] condescending of God now it's God in us
[48:57] the Holy Spirit not the third person the
[49:01] same person
[49:03] amen
[49:04] Hallelujah all right all right let's go
[49:08] to First John chapter 5.
[49:14] first John chapter 5 the Lord begin
[49:16] actually reading chapter 5 and let's
[49:19] take verse four
[49:20] to start with here
[49:32] for whatsoever is born of God anybody
[49:35] born of God
[49:37] born of who
[49:39] God
[49:42] how did he birth his people
[49:45] how did he bring you to New Birth
[49:47] the prophet said by the spoken word
[49:51] that's how he brings us to birth that's
[49:53] how he bursts his seed
[49:56] is the word spoken you're in the season
[49:59] to receive it and to hear it now we're
[50:00] coming to that more in just a moment
[50:03] so whatsoever
[50:05] is born of God
[50:09] what is the new birth Brother David what
[50:11] is the new birth it's the baptism of the
[50:13] Holy Ghost
[50:15] amen and what is the baptism coming upon
[50:20] determines the birth of God it has to
[50:23] fall on the seat of God
[50:25] amen all right because you can you can
[50:28] have the baptism the genuine baptism a
[50:30] person could have the genuine baptism in
[50:32] their spirit
[50:34] and be anointed by that Spirit but not
[50:36] the word and the soul
[50:39] amen that's right
[50:41] and remember the soul controls the bot
[50:43] the spirit and the spirit controls the
[50:45] body
[50:48] is that right so what's in the soul is
[50:50] going to control the spirit
[50:53] amen
[50:56] so you see in first John 5 again that
[50:59] whatsoever is born of God overcometh the
[51:01] world
[51:03] and this is the victory
[51:05] this is what is the victory what's
[51:08] birthed
[51:09] and this is the victory that overcometh
[51:11] the world our faith
[51:14] remember the faith of God in you is the
[51:17] believer
[51:19] brother Brown said that perfect Faith he
[51:21] said the faith the believer is the faith
[51:24] of God that's in you
[51:26] that's the believer he said that's the
[51:28] True Believer
[51:30] amen all right first John 5 again verse
[51:34] 11.
[51:36] and this is the record that God hath
[51:39] given to us
[51:42] this is the record that God has given to
[51:44] us eternal life
[51:46] and this life is in his son
[51:50] is that right this life is in his son
[51:53] he that hath the son
[51:57] he that you can't have the son without
[52:00] the seed
[52:03] is that right because when the seed was
[52:05] expressed that was God manifested in
[52:08] flesh which made Jesus the son
[52:12] amen are you with me that was God the
[52:14] son
[52:17] God above us God With Us where is he now
[52:21] same God all right so he said now
[52:26] it's God in us now he says
[52:29] in verse 11 this is the record that and
[52:32] he that verse 12 he that hath the son
[52:34] hath life
[52:37] and he that hath not the Son of God hath
[52:40] not life
[52:42] so it's already something he had it just
[52:44] needed to be unveiled express it needed
[52:47] to become to life
[52:49] amen
[52:52] amen all right now
[52:55] Jesus lived in a world that no one
[52:58] knowed about
[53:00] he was the fullness of the godhead
[53:01] bodily he lived in a world that no one
[53:04] other words he lived in an atmosphere he
[53:07] lived in a world
[53:08] amen he lived in a dimension he lived in
[53:11] a in a in a realm
[53:14] that no one knew about and yet he was a
[53:17] man
[53:19] all right
[53:20] he was an odd person
[53:24] you know you know oddball
[53:28] amongst the Pharisees the religionists
[53:30] of the world and the religionists of the
[53:32] age claiming to believe the message he
[53:34] was an oddball
[53:37] okay he was an oddball he lived in a
[53:40] world or an atmosphere here again a
[53:42] realm of perfect faith
[53:45] in the perfect God in which he was
[53:51] let this mind be in you
[53:54] which was also he being in the form of
[53:56] God thought it now robbery what about
[53:59] the form where is the form of God today
[54:02] it's not another person it's Jesus
[54:04] Christ but where is the form of God
[54:06] today where is he manifested you say
[54:09] well the message the message was the Met
[54:11] where's the message
[54:16] where's the message the message has got
[54:18] to be somewhere it didn't leave when the
[54:19] prophet left the message he sent it to
[54:22] the bride he said the bride under her
[54:24] messenger would be the final voice then
[54:26] where's The Voice
[54:29] what proceeded out of the mouth the
[54:31] prophet went somewhere and it had to go
[54:32] into the heart of the Bride because the
[54:34] bride he said would be the final voice
[54:38] not another voice just the final voice
[54:40] then what would she be she'd be saying
[54:43] the same thing that God said through his
[54:44] Prophet The Bride would be saying the
[54:47] same thing
[54:50] and then the spirit and the bride say
[54:52] come
[54:53] on
[54:55] all right so he said
[54:58] so he said here he says he had he lived
[55:00] in a world of perfect faith in the
[55:02] perfect God in which he was if we lived
[55:05] in perfect in a in a perfect faith and
[55:08] perfect faith is God's faith it's not
[55:10] another Faith perfect faith is God's
[55:12] faith Hebrews 11 1 is perfect faith
[55:16] it's not an intellectual faith
[55:19] amen it's not intellectual
[55:22] intellectual faith will get you nowhere
[55:23] but when you have God in you that's God
[55:26] living his life through you that's God's
[55:29] faith
[55:29] amen and he will reveal himself because
[55:32] the action of God living in you the
[55:35] evidence of himself living in you is
[55:37] that he would reveal the word for the
[55:39] season to you
[55:43] you would receive the word for the hour
[55:45] you'd see it
[55:48] amen you would see it's here it's
[55:51] present tense
[55:53] it's uniting time
[55:55] amen
[55:56] let us be glad to Rejoice the marriage
[55:58] of the Lamb has come
[56:02] amen the evidence
[56:04] of Yuri of the Holy Ghost in you is not
[56:07] shouting not dancing not speaking in
[56:10] tongues not emotion not a feeling it's
[56:13] the revealing of this word in you
[56:15] personally lived out through you
[56:19] amen we'll come into that more I just
[56:22] kind of jumped ahead there a little bit
[56:24] but this he said if we lived in a
[56:28] perfect faith of a of a Christian to
[56:30] what we are
[56:32] what are we we came from the same Source
[56:35] he did what are we
[56:38] who are we
[56:41] we must have it we must be the same
[56:43] brother random said the real you the
[56:45] real we the real you he said is the
[56:48] spirit of God in you it's not this outer
[56:51] man it's the you inside the you is the
[56:54] spirit of God that's the birth word I
[56:57] appreciated the songs Tonight speaking
[56:59] of such love I pray that after this
[57:00] service you would see such love that God
[57:03] would have for you that once he made a
[57:05] decision of you and had you in his
[57:07] thinking nobody no devil no enemy is
[57:09] going to take you out of his thoughts he
[57:11] can't remove you
[57:15] hallelujah amen all right so he said if
[57:20] we live in a perfect faith of a
[57:22] Christian to what we are and Faith what
[57:25] is Faith what is faith brother Brown
[57:27] said faith is something that's revealed
[57:29] to you
[57:33] faith is a revelation
[57:36] then the Revelation is substance it's
[57:38] not something you imagine it's not an
[57:40] intellectual conception it's absolutely
[57:42] something you know and you possess
[57:46] it's real and it's substance
[57:49] amen and nobody can move you out of it
[57:52] take you away from it
[57:54] what if it's revealed to you it's
[57:57] substance it's himself revealed in you
[58:02] it's who you are
[58:04] that's the believer
[58:06] all right so
[58:09] he said you'd he you'd be if you lived
[58:11] if you lived in the perfect Faith to
[58:13] what you are or what we are we'd be a
[58:16] Mystic to the world the people wouldn't
[58:18] understand you you'd walk in the spirit
[58:19] what the spirit said you would do what
[58:22] if forbid you would not do
[58:24] you would be a Mystic person to them
[58:26] that's the way it is to all believers
[58:30] they're a Mystic that people don't
[58:32] understand because they live in a world
[58:34] to themselves well it sounds like you're
[58:36] just pretty selfish you know it's not
[58:38] selfishness it's Unity
[58:40] of one God in you
[58:43] you and him and he and you you know how
[58:46] what have any other and if there's
[58:48] really True Fellowship it would be
[58:49] fellowship with him and you and him and
[58:52] I and him and you would have Fellowship
[58:55] because his two pet folks if two people
[58:58] in one ship
[59:00] that's real Fellowship
[59:03] amen it's the fellowship under the
[59:05] revealed word for the hour and the time
[59:10] Christ in you and Christ and me now we
[59:12] have Fellowship
[59:15] because our fellowship is with him with
[59:17] Jesus Christ the son of God that's our
[59:19] fellowship
[59:21] first John 1 says that
[59:25] all right so so we see here that
[59:29] so when a man lives by faith and walks
[59:31] by faith I mean substance Faith he is
[59:35] isolated from the entire world
[59:38] praise the Lord
[59:40] there's a veil that's dropped it's
[59:41] isolated the world can't get to you
[59:44] amen right the devil can't even reach to
[59:46] you he can't get to you
[59:48] amen you're hit away he can't come to
[59:50] you because if he does he comes through
[59:51] the blood if he comes through the blood
[59:53] he's my brother
[59:55] he's welcome where I'm at
[59:59] right but he can't come through the
[1:00:00] blood can he he can't do it
[1:00:04] because the blood contains the very
[1:00:05] literal life of Jesus Christ
[1:00:08] and that's the token and he can't
[1:00:09] receive the token
[1:00:12] he can't manifest the resurrection of
[1:00:14] Jesus Christ
[1:00:16] amen
[1:00:20] only the anointed word can do that the
[1:00:23] Messiah of the age the Messiah of the
[1:00:25] time
[1:00:26] can manifest the anointed word for that
[1:00:28] age
[1:00:29] amen all right now so when a man lives
[1:00:33] by faith and walks by faith all right
[1:00:36] substance Faith he's entire he's he is
[1:00:39] isolated from the entire world it
[1:00:41] becomes a new creature a new creation
[1:00:43] all things have passed away the new
[1:00:46] creature is that Faith or God's Own
[1:00:50] promise that he had in himself it's
[1:00:53] himself revealed in you that's the new
[1:00:55] creature you are
[1:00:59] he comes to Quicken his own word he
[1:01:01] comes to Quicken his seat what separates
[1:01:03] the bride from the rest is that they are
[1:01:06] the predestinated seed
[1:01:10] that's what come predestinated by God
[1:01:12] eternally is that seed when you
[1:01:15] recognize you're that seed
[1:01:18] you're Christ you're nothing else that's
[1:01:20] your position that is your
[1:01:22] identification
[1:01:26] amen it's not the flesh man it's not my
[1:01:29] mistakes it's not my ups and downs my
[1:01:31] failures that has nothing to do with
[1:01:33] that inside of the inside man you've
[1:01:35] come alive you're alive you're living
[1:01:38] God never had another thought about you
[1:01:40] well they failed I guess I can't no it
[1:01:42] doesn't that's not what he's judging you
[1:01:44] by
[1:01:45] e he already knew you
[1:01:49] he said I knew you before the foundation
[1:01:51] of the world
[1:01:52] others come to him and said haven't I
[1:01:54] preached Heaven I've been anointed

[1:03:08] you're getting into rapturing condition
[1:03:14] now that means for each of us not just
[1:03:17] the pastor not the deacons not just the
[1:03:20] trustees that means for the laity every
[1:03:23] individual
[1:03:27] amen walks in a world with God Alone
[1:03:33] amen you're baptized into his kingdom
[1:03:36] there's nobody in there but you and God
[1:03:37] he gives the orders you pack them out
[1:03:41] amen how's he giving the order he
[1:03:43] reveals it to you and you carry it out
[1:03:45] you're the branch
[1:03:47] you're energized by the mind you're
[1:03:50] bringing the fruit in its season
[1:03:53] right and you carry it out you're the
[1:03:55] body
[1:03:56] amen
[1:03:58] all right
[1:03:59] whatever he says there's not a shadow of
[1:04:02] a doubt nowhere you walk right on if the
[1:04:04] Lord says this there's nobody in the
[1:04:05] world can talk you out of it you go
[1:04:07] right on this the same now you're coming
[1:04:08] into perfect faith
[1:04:11] you're coming into perfect Perfection
[1:04:14] that cannot fail
[1:04:17] that faith never failed brother Brown
[1:04:19] said another place that Faith knows no
[1:04:22] hindrances
[1:04:25] and that Masters all circumstances what
[1:04:29] are you going to bring the circumstance
[1:04:30] under your feelings
[1:04:32] your reasoning no
[1:04:34] the word
[1:04:36] the word
[1:04:37] the word of faith
[1:04:40] amen you bring it under the word
[1:04:43] it's written
[1:04:46] what is what was Jesus referring to it's
[1:04:48] written what is referring to himself his
[1:04:52] position it's written what did he use to
[1:04:54] conquer the enemy it's written thou
[1:04:57] shall not tempt the Lord thy God
[1:05:01] amen all right he said now you're coming
[1:05:06] into perfect Perfection that cannot fail
[1:05:08] that faith never fails
[1:05:11] and he was a Mystic to them with this
[1:05:13] perfect faith and so is it now with
[1:05:15] those who have perfect faith so
[1:05:18] somebody's going to have perfect faith
[1:05:22] they are a Mystic to others
[1:05:25] so the word material material means
[1:05:27] substance
[1:05:29] it means other meanings but the meaning
[1:05:31] were and I I looked that up to you sure
[1:05:34] it's the the another word for material
[1:05:36] is substance
[1:05:38] so bride substance
[1:05:41] what's the bright substance God's Own
[1:05:46] all right now Faith is the substance of
[1:05:49] things hoped for what is it also the
[1:05:51] evidence
[1:05:53] of Things Not Seen
[1:05:58] you don't see the Holy Spirit
[1:06:00] but you have the evidence
[1:06:05] amen you have the evidence of himself
[1:06:07] what he said the evidence would be he
[1:06:10] doesn't reveal and open his word to
[1:06:12] everybody he opens it to his bride
[1:06:16] because only the elect
[1:06:20] we were seed and therefore we were
[1:06:23] reborn this is the prophet's words we
[1:06:25] were seed therefore we were Reborn
[1:06:28] for only the elect can be reborn
[1:06:34] just the elect bride the only one going
[1:06:36] in the first resurrection is the bride
[1:06:39] the rest even though they can be same
[1:06:41] material are you hearing me
[1:06:44] 25th chapter of Matthew this the foolish
[1:06:47] virgin was same material
[1:06:50] same material same but they didn't have
[1:06:53] oil
[1:06:55] to do what they were remnant of that
[1:06:58] material
[1:07:00] but God chose out that material made it
[1:07:03] cut to her
[1:07:05] and
[1:07:06] amen are you with me the material I'm
[1:07:08] talking about cloth what she was clothed
[1:07:11] with what she was clothed under was the
[1:07:13] same that material was good material
[1:07:15] clean material Sanctified material but
[1:07:19] God made a choice
[1:07:20] when he put the pattern to it and took
[1:07:23] the bride which was a portion of the
[1:07:26] material and set it as his bride
[1:07:30] and we'll come more into that if the
[1:07:31] Lord allows me to bring out some things
[1:07:33] later on but not tonight
[1:07:36] amen so he so there's a there's a part
[1:07:40] that's bride
[1:07:42] that does not go through the tribulation
[1:07:44] and there's a part
[1:07:45] that's tribulation saint that does
[1:07:49] but she gets eternal life at the white
[1:07:51] Throne judgment
[1:07:54] I'm talking about tribulation Saints
[1:07:57] amen the bride's setting their judging
[1:08:02] her book has already been written it's
[1:08:05] already unveiled the book for the bride
[1:08:07] is unveiled to her now she's judged
[1:08:10] sinless
[1:08:12] she's judge eternal
[1:08:14] her judgment is the open book and those
[1:08:16] names which are people are written in
[1:08:18] that book
[1:08:20] amen
[1:08:21] in fact The Book of Life only con
[1:08:23] contained Book of Life and Book of Life
[1:08:26] Book of the living is the same book
[1:08:29] amen same book
[1:08:31] but but there's a portion of that book
[1:08:35] that's the bride portion
[1:08:38] amen and that bride portion
[1:08:42] amen
[1:08:44] is what's that that record that I just
[1:08:47] talked about right there he's given us a
[1:08:49] record and that record is eternal life
[1:08:52] amen and how do you know it's a new
[1:08:55] living because the word for the hour is
[1:08:57] revealed to you you see it plainly you
[1:09:01] see it and the word identifies it and
[1:09:03] you're seeing it yet you can't give it
[1:09:05] to somebody else
[1:09:08] that's why we can preach this live it
[1:09:11] and they think well somebody they're
[1:09:13] just they're just they're just a little
[1:09:15] off in their head you know we don't
[1:09:16] understand they're so Mystic anyway
[1:09:18] let's go on
[1:09:21] all right I said let's literally go on
[1:09:25] those Eternal thoughts are now manifest
[1:09:28] in flesh
[1:09:29] those Eternal thoughts which are now
[1:09:31] manifest in flesh are the sons of God
[1:09:34] all right
[1:09:36] you are you are himself as we said in
[1:09:40] another form
[1:09:41] all right
[1:09:46] material is substance
[1:09:53] I want to just bring this I'll just
[1:09:54] bring this to you right now so you
[1:09:56] remember it concept a concept is
[1:09:59] something conceived in the mind and
[1:10:01] we'll come to that in just a minute
[1:10:02] conceived means
[1:10:05] to form a device or a plan also
[1:10:08] conceived means to become pregnant with
[1:10:10] a child
[1:10:16] what did he say about the bride today
[1:10:18] was she pregnated
[1:10:20] with what
[1:10:22] an eternal child
[1:10:24] is that right amen
[1:10:28] amen
[1:10:30] amen all right I'll just leave that
[1:10:32] right there
[1:10:34] for a minute
[1:10:36] under the under the message called
[1:10:38] identification to Lair California
[1:10:41] the only thing the only thing
[1:10:44] he was was eternal and in him was
[1:10:47] attributes and those attributes were
[1:10:48] thoughts
[1:10:51] it's God's thoughts made manifest by his
[1:10:54] word
[1:10:55] now listen I know I'm reading here but I
[1:10:57] just want you to catch this
[1:10:59] it's just my way of ministry I I just
[1:11:01] unless I just got to get it to you one
[1:11:03] way or the other
[1:11:07] amen
[1:11:10] and that's up to God to do it that way
[1:11:12] all right now
[1:11:14] it's God's thoughts made manifest by his
[1:11:16] word and brought to a reality
[1:11:22] now the word was in the beginning before
[1:11:24] it was a word a word is the thought made
[1:11:26] manifest and God had to think it before
[1:11:28] he could make it a word
[1:11:32] then he spoke the word and it
[1:11:34] materialized
[1:11:36] all right so what would that word that
[1:11:39] word that was his thought
[1:11:42] remember these thoughts that we're
[1:11:43] talking about are Eternal thoughts
[1:11:46] in other words they're the thoughts of
[1:11:48] God
[1:11:49] the prophet said this and I read this
[1:11:51] but let me just read it again to you
[1:11:54] he said this he said in the beginning
[1:11:56] when he thought of you and thought of
[1:11:58] others like that thought of himself
[1:12:02] of being tangible
[1:12:05] or becoming material
[1:12:07] he thought of himself being that when he
[1:12:10] thought of you he thought of himself
[1:12:11] becoming tangible material
[1:12:14] substance
[1:12:16] manifest in flesh
[1:12:21] and all he had to do was say Let There
[1:12:23] be let there be
[1:12:24] and so in this hour when the prophet
[1:12:27] when he spoke his word through a prophet
[1:12:28] he said let there be and here you are
[1:12:32] what what was in you to receive that
[1:12:34] word to hear it to be able to receive it
[1:12:36] to
[1:12:37] manifested in this hour see
[1:12:41] you had an ability to hear the word
[1:12:44] all right
[1:12:48] and so in order to do that God himself
[1:12:51] had to conceive his thoughts that's an
[1:12:54] exact statement brother Brown said God
[1:12:56] when he saw his children Adam and Eve
[1:12:58] and he said they were they were lost he
[1:13:01] didn't want to leave them that way so he
[1:13:03] said he conceived the thought
[1:13:06] this is what I'll do
[1:13:10] amen he conceived it
[1:13:15] okay
[1:13:17] now
[1:13:22] what is it
[1:13:23] and the Word was materialized God had to
[1:13:25] think it very make it a word he spoke
[1:13:27] the word and materialized what is it
[1:13:29] it's God all God becoming tangible
[1:13:33] and you are a part of God and Jesus
[1:13:36] don't miss this now this is this is what
[1:13:38] I want to speak here the redeemable
[1:13:40] thoughts he said and Jesus come to
[1:13:42] redeem those that was put on the Lamb's
[1:13:44] Book of Life
[1:13:48] before the foundation of the world
[1:13:53] it was what did he come to redeem those
[1:13:55] that were put in the Lamb's Book of Life
[1:13:57] before the foundation of the world
[1:14:00] he said
[1:14:03] it was in God's thoughts
[1:14:08] and that's what he come to redeem
[1:14:13] so what did he come to redeem his
[1:14:16] thoughts
[1:14:18] of you
[1:14:20] when he thought of himself he thought of
[1:14:22] you
[1:14:25] that's what he come to redeem
[1:14:27] that's what he come to buy back he had
[1:14:30] the purchase you are a purchased
[1:14:31] possession you are his eternal
[1:14:33] possession you are his kingdom
[1:14:38] what is the kingdom of God it's the word
[1:14:40] made spirit in you made life in you amen
[1:14:45] it's in you it's not a public show the
[1:14:47] public doesn't know anything about this
[1:14:49] it's the seventh seal and the public
[1:14:51] doesn't know it
[1:14:53] they can't know it it's not to them
[1:14:56] it's to the bride brother Brown said
[1:14:59] that's the only one the secret was
[1:15:01] revealed to was the bride
[1:15:04] the only one that could receive the
[1:15:05] secret the only one that knew it
[1:15:09] amen amen you say Brother David how many
[1:15:11] is in that number that's none of my
[1:15:13] business I just know I'm one of them
[1:15:16] because I see the evidence of what he
[1:15:18] said would be manifesting it through me
[1:15:21] not something I pump up and work up one
[1:15:24] day and if I'm in church I'm okay and if
[1:15:26] I'm out I'm different
[1:15:27] it's not that at all it's him it's him
[1:15:31] revealing himself he isn't basing it
[1:15:33] upon your actions your your mistakes
[1:15:35] your failures he's not judging you by
[1:15:37] that he's not judging you by the way of
[1:15:39] the flesh he took the Judgment of your
[1:15:42] judgment in his flesh that's finished
[1:15:46] you're not coming to judgment there's no
[1:15:47] condemnation to them that are in Christ
[1:15:50] Jesus who walk not after the flesh I
[1:15:53] don't care how many mistakes you make
[1:15:54] you're not walking after the flesh if
[1:15:56] you're in Christ Jesus you walk not
[1:15:58] after the flesh but after the spirit
[1:16:02] the spirit that wrote the word the
[1:16:05] spirit that brought the word when he the
[1:16:07] spirit of Truth is come he'll lead you
[1:16:09] into all truth there's your evidence
[1:16:13] I'll bring these things that I've spoken
[1:16:14] to your remembrance and reveal youth to
[1:16:17] think reveal to you things that is to
[1:16:19] come he said there's brother I said
[1:16:21] that's the genuine evidence right
[1:16:25] that you were in God's thinking because
[1:16:27] God's unveiling himself and you're able
[1:16:29] to receive it
[1:16:31] glory to God Amen that's it
[1:16:36] you have the ability to hear not
[1:16:38] everybody has the ability to hear go
[1:16:41] back to church age book and see what he
[1:16:42] said around Bob 145 to 160 or so see
[1:16:46] what he said about the evidence
[1:16:48] many other places I got a few places
[1:16:50] right here the Lord allowed me to get to
[1:16:52] it
[1:16:54] but the words materialized so what did
[1:16:56] he do it's all God becoming tangible
[1:16:59] see
[1:17:00] that's what he come to redeem was his
[1:17:02] own thoughts and them as soon as it
[1:17:04] strikes them they see it because the
[1:17:07] life is in there
[1:17:10] amen the life is in there
[1:17:13] see it was the thought brother Brown
[1:17:15] said it was the thought then that
[1:17:17] thought become expressed and God bought
[1:17:20] bought bought back Jacob see redeem is
[1:17:23] to bring back or buy back what was
[1:17:26] already his so if you're brought if
[1:17:28] you're redeemable material you had to be
[1:17:30] somewhere to redeem back to
[1:17:32] you had to be somewhere originally
[1:17:35] you're brought back you're brought back
[1:17:37] to that position
[1:17:39] amen all right and so
[1:17:44] see and what what did come
[1:17:46] what did come from God
[1:17:50] eternally he said it was the thought
[1:17:54] he said then that thought become
[1:17:56] expressed and God bought bought back
[1:17:59] Jacob because Jacob alone was seed
[1:18:02] now brother Brad said it's not the
[1:18:04] person that comes free Destiny eternally
[1:18:06] it's the it's the seed but Jacob had the
[1:18:09] seed
[1:18:11] so his name it wasn't Jacob but his name
[1:18:14] was that individual that had that seed
[1:18:16] that person was on The Book of Life and
[1:18:19] he was redeemable product because he was
[1:18:21] God's thought
[1:18:24] and Jacob was a shyster but he watched
[1:18:27] what he desired he had respect to the
[1:18:30] birthright and Covenant of God he wanted
[1:18:32] that Birthright
[1:18:35] amen that's what meant everything to him
[1:18:37] was that Birthright
[1:18:40] what was driving him to that Birthright
[1:18:42] you see God's Own thought of him Jacob
[1:18:47] what was Jacob he was God's thought what
[1:18:50] are you you're God's thought who are you
[1:18:52] who's the real you you're God's thought
[1:18:54] the express down here in the body of
[1:18:56] clay
[1:18:59] amen and what's happening inside of you
[1:19:02] have Rapture already begun
[1:19:04] it's already started you're going to a
[1:19:06] body change what's going to take you
[1:19:08] there
[1:19:09] the unveiling of himself in you the
[1:19:12] mystery that was hid in the Bible is now
[1:19:14] expressed you are the fullness of the
[1:19:16] godhead you're the fullness I mean of
[1:19:19] Jesus Christ see you're the fullness in
[1:19:21] other words when when the seventh angel
[1:19:24] brought his message it was the finished
[1:19:26] the mystery of God
[1:19:30] and you're that mystery
[1:19:33] you're that Finnish mystery the full
[1:19:35] Revelation was to come out today and
[1:19:37] you're that full Revelation you're the
[1:19:40] message of the hour you're not looking
[1:19:41] for a message you are the message we are
[1:19:44] the message we are
[1:19:47] return Ministry
[1:19:51] that's exactly what we are
[1:19:53] we are a return Ministry
[1:19:57] because the bride is the bride coming of
[1:19:59] Christ it had to come to that position
[1:20:01] in order for it to even be a meeting in
[1:20:03] the air she had to come to maturity and
[1:20:06] the and that took a Capstone message to
[1:20:08] bring her there because she has to come
[1:20:10] into that form without us they could not
[1:20:13] be made perfect
[1:20:14] you have to grow up into your position
[1:20:16] you grow up into him
[1:20:20] and The Headstone and the body has
[1:20:22] brother Branham said become one unit
[1:20:25] they're no longer Twain they're one
[1:20:29] prophecy who's going to manifest that
[1:20:31] prophecy who's gonna what what did it
[1:20:33] turn from Prophet to his prophecy who
[1:20:35] wears the prophecy you're that prophecy
[1:20:38] being fulfilled
[1:20:41] amen amen amen I don't mean to scream at
[1:20:45] you but you know me by now
[1:20:49] there you go
[1:20:56] I won't go any farther with it all right
[1:20:59] now
[1:21:02] so he read respect the birthright and
[1:21:04] Covenant if you are true seed you will
[1:21:06] hear that word
[1:21:09] the spirit will baptize you in the body
[1:21:11] of Christ filling you and empowering you
[1:21:13] and you will receive the word for your
[1:21:15] day and age see how clear the true
[1:21:17] evidence becomes when the words revealed
[1:21:19] to you receiving the full revelation of
[1:21:21] God and from God for that day
[1:21:25] there's your evidence
[1:21:28] amen amen
[1:21:31] this body the bride the bride his body
[1:21:34] is the physical body of Christ now
[1:21:37] brother Branham and rising to the son
[1:21:39] asks the question how does this Mortal
[1:21:41] body become his body
[1:21:44] and he answered it Romans 8 11 if the
[1:21:47] spirit that raised up Jesus from the
[1:21:49] dead dwell in you he that raised up
[1:21:52] Christ shall also Quicken your mortal
[1:21:55] body and bring it subject the prophets
[1:21:58] to the word
[1:22:01] right
[1:22:02] amen that's the genuine evidence that's
[1:22:06] how this Mortal body becomes his body by
[1:22:09] the same quickening power that was in
[1:22:11] him is in you you come from the same
[1:22:14] Source he came from he was the fullness
[1:22:16] and you're a measure you're you're a
[1:22:18] spoonful but the there's no difference
[1:22:20] in chemical in the Spoonful as the
[1:22:22] measure it's the same spirit
[1:22:25] and it operates under the same faith
[1:22:30] and it knows this position as he knew
[1:22:33] his position and we grow into that
[1:22:35] position amen are you with me because
[1:22:38] that position is the Capstone now it's
[1:22:40] coming to just a fine razor edge of
[1:22:43] difference
[1:22:46] but what's the difference is the bride
[1:22:48] won't leave the word
[1:22:51] she has the revelation of that word in
[1:22:53] her it's him in Bride form and she sees
[1:22:56] it and she knows it and what's to do
[1:22:59] make her a big shot it humbles her
[1:23:03] to submission and giving him the key to
[1:23:06] every room of your heart
[1:23:08] this is his house do what this house
[1:23:11] what you want to do Lord amen I give you
[1:23:14] every room I give you the key you have
[1:23:16] the key it's laid upon your shoulders
[1:23:18] you open and you shut you just take your
[1:23:21] Liberty and go into every room within
[1:23:23] this door and go in those doors
[1:23:27] amen that's right
[1:23:30] you give him the key
[1:23:33] you give him the authority to do that
[1:23:36] that's what I want to do
[1:23:38] that's what I desire to do I won't see
[1:23:41] nothing manifest in my life but him
[1:23:45] and don't put your psychology to it
[1:23:47] think he's got to be manifested in your
[1:23:49] psychology he's going to be manifest
[1:23:51] according to his word even though I'm
[1:23:53] yelling at you
[1:23:55] well I can't be God yes it is
[1:23:58] foreign
[1:24:01] that's right
[1:24:02] you try to judge Jesus said I judge
[1:24:05] what's in that heart
[1:24:07] you're judged by the outward appearance
[1:24:09] I just was in the heart what's the heart
[1:24:11] say what's the speaking what's it living
[1:24:14] watch us everyday life
[1:24:16] well I don't have to obey that I'll take
[1:24:19] what I want leave out what I don't want
[1:24:23] even though you look just like a
[1:24:25] believer
[1:24:26] and that better be better than the real
[1:24:28] true ones
[1:24:31] I didn't get Amen on that
[1:24:33] that's the truth
[1:24:39] amen all right now I'm just going to
[1:24:41] have to skip some of this because I'm
[1:24:42] closing out on time now
[1:24:43] all right
[1:24:45] so we are that physical body and when
[1:24:47] it's resurrected it goes to meet its
[1:24:49] mate Christ Jesus says husband and wife
[1:24:51] or as king and queen it's the same
[1:24:53] material
[1:24:56] that was in that body is in the body of
[1:24:59] believers
[1:25:01] amen
[1:25:02] The Same Spirit that was in Christ
[1:25:05] is in US
[1:25:07] doing the same works
[1:25:12] how do we do the works of God by
[1:25:13] Believing on him whom God hath sent
[1:25:18] amen
[1:25:19] all right now
[1:25:24] so in the beginning was the word
[1:25:28] let me just go back here and just bring
[1:25:30] out something
[1:25:32] foreign
[1:25:33] ever come to redeem the cannon fodder
[1:25:36] that we see around professing to be
[1:25:37] Christians
[1:25:39] but he came to redeem that was that
[1:25:41] which was in God's thinking at the
[1:25:43] beginning
[1:25:46] amen
[1:25:49] all right now
[1:25:55] so he come to redeem
[1:25:56] he'd come he could save those that God
[1:25:59] foreknowledge saw in the beginning which
[1:26:02] was his thoughts of you and me
[1:26:04] look to show it's the ones that he
[1:26:06] thought of his thought is the Christian
[1:26:09] of today
[1:26:10] the thoughts before the foundation of
[1:26:12] the world is the Christian of today
[1:26:20] bring it back redeem it bring it back he
[1:26:23] was a redeemer it was God's thought of
[1:26:24] you think little you little me no one in
[1:26:27] the world could take my place nobody can
[1:26:28] take yours you being a Christian and
[1:26:30] filled with the spirit of God and before
[1:26:32] the foundation of the world seen you and
[1:26:34] note every feature you got and Jesus
[1:26:37] come to bring you back
[1:26:38] that's what Jesus was here for the
[1:26:41] Redeemer the human body to bring you
[1:26:43] back
[1:26:44] amen they had to come he had to come he
[1:26:47] had to come to be a human as a redeemer
[1:26:49] display his attributes the Savior to
[1:26:52] redeem you and bring you back to where
[1:26:53] you come from
[1:26:55] all right
[1:26:59] you was this thought
[1:27:00] from the Eternal and now it's expressed
[1:27:03] in the human being for his glory that's
[1:27:06] you bride
[1:27:07] he expressed himself in Jesus Christ it
[1:27:10] was God becoming material
[1:27:12] and what did he say now it's expressing
[1:27:15] himself into bride
[1:27:17] where's the material now
[1:27:22] amen all right
[1:27:24] now
[1:27:38] I'm wanting to get okay here we are
[1:27:42] he was asked brother Brown I was asked
[1:27:44] what would you think would be in
[1:27:45] evidence and evidence I said the most
[1:27:48] perfect evidence I can think of is love
[1:27:50] and everybody would say amen that's it
[1:27:52] that's it it's love we know God is love
[1:27:55] but that can be impersonated
[1:28:02] that's right oh yeah filial
[1:28:04] we're just going to have feel you'll
[1:28:06] think it's agape love there's only one
[1:28:07] true agape love that's God himself
[1:28:10] God himself in you is love
[1:28:15] amen that's it all right now
[1:28:19] but he said Brother Brad Manson said
[1:28:21] that sounded pretty good then I thought
[1:28:22] that sounded pretty good if a man has
[1:28:24] got love but one day the Lord in a
[1:28:26] vision straightened me out
[1:28:28] he said the evidence of the spirit was
[1:28:31] those who could receive the word
[1:28:35] his either neither loved nor speaking in
[1:28:37] tongues but it's receiving the word
[1:28:41] and then Dr Vale was saying to me that
[1:28:43] is scriptural he said because John 14
[1:28:45] said when he the Holy Ghost has come
[1:28:47] upon you he will reveal these things to
[1:28:50] you that I've taught you and will show
[1:28:52] you things to come so there is the
[1:28:54] genuine evidence of the Holy Ghost
[1:28:57] he's never told me anything wrong yet
[1:28:59] that is the evidence of the Holy Ghost
[1:29:01] is he who can believe the word you can
[1:29:04] receive it
[1:29:07] Jesus never said when the Holy Ghost has
[1:29:09] come you'll speak in tongues he never
[1:29:10] said the Holy Ghost come and you'll do
[1:29:12] any of those things he said he will take
[1:29:14] these things of mine and show them
[1:29:18] reveal them show them to you and will
[1:29:22] show you things to come that is to come
[1:29:25] that show you things that is to come so
[1:29:27] there's the genuine evidence the Holy
[1:29:29] Ghost According To Jesus himself now I
[1:29:33] want to jump ahead here
[1:29:35] and I'm going to be closing
[1:29:39] if we go to the message
[1:29:42] in third seal
[1:29:45] let me just read what he said here this
[1:29:47] is the third seal Saint John 1 in the
[1:29:50] beginning was the word we could read the
[1:29:52] scripture you know what the scripture
[1:29:54] said in beginning was the word and the
[1:29:56] Word was with God and the word
[1:29:59] was with God and the Word was God and
[1:30:01] the word became flesh and dwelt Among Us
[1:30:05] amen
[1:30:12] I want to just find here what he said
[1:30:14] about that word
[1:30:20] yeah here it is in John 1 1 where it
[1:30:23] says in the beginning was the word the
[1:30:25] root from which we get our translation
[1:30:27] for word is logos
[1:30:30] which means the thought
[1:30:34] or concept a concept is a thought
[1:30:39] conceived
[1:30:43] remember I said I'd come back to that
[1:30:45] the concept is the thought conceived he
[1:30:48] said logos means the thought or concept
[1:30:51] it has the double meaning of thought and
[1:30:53] speech so in order for for what God did
[1:30:56] was he thought he had that thought but
[1:30:59] he had to put the thought
[1:31:00] into creation
[1:31:02] and he spoke it by a word
[1:31:05] he expressed that thought and that
[1:31:07] thought expressed was word
[1:31:09] all right so
[1:31:12] and now I thought expressed brother
[1:31:14] Brown says it right behind that now I
[1:31:16] thought expresses a word or words isn't
[1:31:18] that wonderful
[1:31:20] see
[1:31:21] then God conceived his thoughts he said
[1:31:24] he and what he said to about Adam and
[1:31:26] and Eve I'll take their place I'll die
[1:31:28] in their Stead
[1:31:31] amen he conceived his thought now
[1:31:38] now you know the bridegroom tree and the
[1:31:40] bride tree is the same tree but the
[1:31:42] bridegroom tree can't bear the fruit the
[1:31:44] bride tree does
[1:31:47] without the bride tree
[1:31:51] it has to Bear the fruit of the
[1:31:52] bridegroom tree he said that he's got to
[1:31:54] have the bride tree she has got to be
[1:31:56] born of the same material
[1:31:58] amen all right
[1:32:02] see it's come from the same source
[1:32:05] the word made flesh hope you get it it's
[1:32:07] the same life in this female tree same
[1:32:10] life all right
[1:32:12] now
[1:32:13] When you pray now I just let me continue
[1:32:15] reading third seal
[1:32:18] When you pray
[1:32:20] he said in the beginning was the word
[1:32:22] the word was with God and the Word was
[1:32:24] God and the word became flesh and
[1:32:25] dwelled Among Us god dwelt with this in
[1:32:27] flesh he was the word now watch what he
[1:32:30] says before it was before a word it's a
[1:32:33] thought and a thought has to be created
[1:32:36] all right so God's thoughts become
[1:32:38] creation when it was spoke by a word
[1:32:43] that's when he presents it to you as a
[1:32:45] thought
[1:32:48] as something conceived then
[1:32:50] he presents it to you as a thought or
[1:32:52] something revealed the words revealed
[1:32:54] and it's a thought he presents it to is
[1:32:56] the thought his thought and it's
[1:32:58] revealed to you
[1:33:00] then it's still a thought
[1:33:02] until you speak it God has not changed
[1:33:06] his way or behavior I added that in
[1:33:08] there watch God has never changed
[1:33:11] he spoken in the beginning he still
[1:33:13] speaks it today all right
[1:33:17] so faith is an actual substance now
[1:33:20] watch
[1:33:20] and I'm going to try to skip over this
[1:33:24] what God in his word creation it was an
[1:33:27] object he spoke it the word was created
[1:33:30] because it was an object in God's mind
[1:33:36] it was an object in God's mind in his
[1:33:39] heart remember where the bride was she
[1:33:41] was in his mind
[1:33:43] all right
[1:33:45] it was an object of God's mind in his
[1:33:47] heart he just spoke it and it come into
[1:33:49] existence
[1:33:51] now what's this people going to do
[1:33:52] what's his children going to do see
[1:33:54] watch our maturity here
[1:33:56] to be able to realize what we are and
[1:33:58] that we can speak
[1:34:00] but what are we speaking
[1:34:02] not just a whim not just the fancy but a
[1:34:05] revelation
[1:34:08] that's where the waiting on God becomes
[1:34:10] right there
[1:34:11] because God knows how to reveal it to
[1:34:13] you yes
[1:34:15] amen is that right all right Jesus never
[1:34:19] jumped right at it brother remember the
[1:34:20] scripture said hold fast the confession
[1:34:22] of your revelation
[1:34:24] faith
[1:34:26] it's got to be Faith first
[1:34:30] amen all right now
[1:34:33] so God knows exactly when to reveal
[1:34:35] something to you as you have need of it
[1:34:39] now I'm not talking about you can't have
[1:34:41] a proper mental attitude
[1:34:43] but you hold a proper mental attitude
[1:34:45] towards God's word and he will reveal it
[1:34:47] and Quicken it in its season in time
[1:34:50] amen and bring it to pass what will the
[1:34:52] Revelation do put the word of God into
[1:34:54] manifestation
[1:34:58] when spoken
[1:35:00] amen all right now
[1:35:04] he said you have Zoe God's life in us we
[1:35:06] become sons and amateur creators
[1:35:09] whatever you see believe what you say
[1:35:11] you shall have it
[1:35:13] and he said a lot of times I could I
[1:35:15] can't hardly think myself but I'd say it
[1:35:18] anyhow a thought that I can't even think
[1:35:20] myself would come find out it did happen
[1:35:22] that way I'd say things and it didn't
[1:35:24] hardly didn't mean for it to happen that
[1:35:27] way but it did anyhow and I thought wait
[1:35:28] a minute you see when we speak anything
[1:35:30] if something is anchored in us we
[1:35:33] shouldn't speak till we believe it we
[1:35:35] should not speak until we believe it
[1:35:37] then we believe it we speak it that
[1:35:39] creative word goes out it's a part of
[1:35:41] God and it creates now brother Bradham
[1:35:44] said we have the power to create a world
[1:35:45] and go live a private life on it watch
[1:35:48] what he said you have been given the
[1:35:49] power
[1:35:53] but
[1:35:54] that power is controlled by law
[1:35:59] amen go back to see that power is
[1:36:01] controlled by law and it's called The
[1:36:03] Law of faith
[1:36:06] you can't go out and create a world and
[1:36:07] go live on it you could if it was
[1:36:09] revealed to you
[1:36:11] right
[1:36:13] but it's controlled the power's there
[1:36:15] but the law the faith controls the power
[1:36:22] amen all right so you take you take you
[1:36:26] say that it's it's controlled see
[1:36:31] it must be revealed to you or conceived
[1:36:34] first as a thought then then you speak
[1:36:36] the thought then the power Goes Forth
[1:36:38] through the word of faith and is
[1:36:39] manifest
[1:36:41] amen hold fast to the confession of our
[1:36:45] faith the Bible said in Romans 10 8 we
[1:36:47] have the word neither even in thy mouth
[1:36:48] and in thy heart which is what
[1:36:50] the word of
[1:36:52] faith
[1:36:55] amen
[1:36:57] if thou shall believe in thy heart and
[1:36:59] confess with thy mouth
[1:37:02] see all right all right
[1:37:06] now
[1:37:13] God had to think it before it became for
[1:37:15] he could make it a word
[1:37:19] amen and he spoke the word materialize
[1:37:24] we speak it just like you have to think
[1:37:26] of anything before you speak now it
[1:37:29] let's see I'm just trying to go down
[1:37:30] here
[1:37:34] he wanted to become material then he
[1:37:36] spoke a word the words materialized
[1:37:38] that's the whole picture from Genesis
[1:37:39] Revelation there's nothing wrong it's
[1:37:41] Elohim materializing so he can be
[1:37:44] touched and felt we find that in Saint
[1:37:46] John or first John 1 2 we touched him we
[1:37:49] handled him
[1:37:50] we saw him and now we're declaring him
[1:37:52] to you he left the scene but here he is
[1:37:55] the same life in us and the Bible said
[1:37:57] in verse 3 we're declaring him to you
[1:37:58] and that our fellowship is with Jesus
[1:38:01] Christ
[1:38:03] amen all right I don't have time to go
[1:38:06] back and read that you can read that
[1:38:07] first John 1 2. so Elohim materializing
[1:38:11] so he can be touched or felt in what in
[1:38:13] Bride form
[1:38:18] so
