[44:46] it's not relevant uh I don't want to
[44:49] keep you or distract you but you know uh
[44:52] in some of my research and looking at
[44:54] things we're talking about what is
[44:56] relevant for this day and um the
[44:59] churches are changing trying to be
[45:02] relevant they they want to do and uh I
[45:06] come across a little video clip that was
[45:09] titled The Greatest Show on Earth then
[45:13] underneath it in parentheses the
[45:17] church and it literally showed the of a
[45:20] circus on the stage of a mega
[45:24] church and you know circus people aren't
[45:27] known for how they dress and there it is
[45:31] right in the house of God just being
[45:34] manifested out and I thought you know
[45:37] what the word is relevant for the bride
[45:43] amen she's not looking for something
[45:45] else she's not thinking I need
[45:47] entertained in the house of God she come
[45:50] because she's got a soul that desires to
[45:53] be fed she says I want the word because
[45:57] the word is my life amen and so I I just
[46:02] thought that was interesting as you just
[46:04] sometimes get on a little thread a
[46:05] little idea uh I I believe the ministry
[46:08] here would know what I'm talking about
[46:09] you just get on something and you don't
[46:11] always dictate exactly where it takes
[46:13] you but you realize at the time when you
[46:15] get there why you went there and uh I'm
[46:19] telling you my brother and sister God is
[46:21] good amen amen we live in a day that
[46:23] everything is so deceptive uh um you
[46:26] know know uh we we look at these things
[46:29] and uh sorry to to keep you standing but
[46:32] I just share this last little thought
[46:35] what was the title of brother Chad's
[46:37] sermon with the tuning Forks
[46:40] Sype sympathetic resonance I I would
[46:43] encourage you to listen to that because
[46:46] it shows right there in sound and I
[46:48] won't go into detail but it shows you
[46:50] right there in sound How Sound can be uh
[46:53] in this as he demonstrates so close that
[46:57] our ear doesn't know the difference but
[46:59] something tells us something's not quite
[47:02] right that's right and as it is there
[47:05] brother Chad makes a very strong point
[47:08] amen so close that you will not know the
[47:13] difference but the Holy Spirit In You
[47:16] amen will show you that there is a
[47:20] difference amen amen Jeremiah the 50th
[47:24] chapter I want to speak to you the Lord
[47:26] hath opened his
[47:28] Armory and uh so as we we'll come today
[47:32] uh and uh we we'll take this my brother
[47:35] and sister hopefully the Lord will just
[47:37] uh let it unfold very clearly and uh
[47:40] sister Sue not to embarrass you but
[47:42] welcome back it seems like it's been a
[47:44] bit since we saw you but uh family and
[47:48] surprise was it a surprise surprise
[47:52] anniversary amen nothing like delaying
[47:55] the presentation of the surprise to
[47:57] really make it a surprise and and um but
[48:00] to have the family and everyone together
[48:03] sorry I couldn't be there kind of felt
[48:05] obligated to some other situations and
[48:08] uh but God bless you amen Jeremiah 50
[48:12] verses 22-
[48:15] 25 amen this scripture should be looked
[48:19] at in a current sense amen amen a sound
[48:23] of battle is in the land and of great
[48:27] destruction how is the Hammer of the
[48:29] whole earth cut aunder and broken how is
[48:33] Babylon become a desolation among the
[48:36] Nations I have laid a snare for thee and
[48:40] thou art also taken oh Babylon thou was
[48:44] not aware thou art found and also caught
[48:48] because thou Hast striven against the
[48:50] Lord the Lord hath opened his Armory and
[48:54] hath brought forth the weapons of his
[48:56] IND Nation for this is the work of the
[48:59] Lord God of hosts in the land of the
[49:02] Chaldeans I'd like to read verse five
[49:05] again the Lord hath opened his Armory
[49:09] and hath brought forth the weapons of
[49:11] his indignation for this is the work of
[49:14] the Lord God of hosts
[49:16] in the leodan
[49:19] age Heavenly Father we ask you Lord just
[49:22] come speak to us today Father it is good
[49:24] to be in the house of the Lord Lord our
[49:27] hearts are happy Lord we are thankful
[49:30] father that we have a place and Lord as
[49:33] we will read a little later we realize
[49:35] Lord that it's not a building it's not
[49:38] but Lord we realize that it is good to
[49:40] be here in the house of God a church
[49:42] that you provided for us Lord and have
[49:45] maintained and filled it with Saints of
[49:48] lack precious faith that desire to serve
[49:50] you Lord how blessed we are today we
[49:53] thank you give praise to you in the name
[49:55] of Jesus Christ
[49:57] amen you may be
[50:01] seated you know everywhere we look in
[50:04] the day that we're living I I don't want
[50:06] to sound like the the uh local news or
[50:10] or whatever but everywhere you look we
[50:13] we see things of the sounds of battle uh
[50:16] there's there's uh uh almost every
[50:18] continent um there is some kind of Riot
[50:22] there's some kind of warfare taking
[50:24] place and and uh when you look at this I
[50:27] mean you could think about it I'll give
[50:28] you a quick Glimpse you just look down
[50:30] in South America and Venezuela that
[50:33] there is all kinds of chaos and people
[50:35] dying over an election amen and uh we
[50:38] know that it doesn't matter in the world
[50:40] of politics which side is actually
[50:42] elected they're not there because they
[50:45] are serving God they're there because
[50:47] they are serving God oh did it sound
[50:49] like I was just a
[50:51] paradox but you see it's not there to
[50:54] lift up our Lord Jesus Christ Christ but
[50:57] they are there because God ordained for
[50:59] them to fulfill certain Acts or certain
[51:02] things before his coming and so there
[51:05] they are serving God Amen they're not in
[51:08] the house of God praising God worshiping
[51:10] God digging into his word but they are
[51:12] there as servants to serve God's greater
[51:16] plan and we'll look at this and and we
[51:18] can go over and uh here in North America
[51:22] you know it's it's interesting we see
[51:24] all kinds of spirits and conflict that
[51:27] is taking place uh we go to Europe the
[51:30] same thing uh we go to Africa uh the
[51:34] same thing Middle East same thing we
[51:37] look at Israel every country would stand
[51:40] and affirm it has a right to defend
[51:42] itself and then they'll stand in the UN
[51:44] and say Israel does not have that right
[51:47] and so you see that they are unsign uh
[51:49] uh uh un unbalanced in that that they're
[51:53] double-minded and and we see this sound
[51:55] of battle everywhere we go and we see
[51:58] the evidence of Destruction amen we look
[52:02] right here at the evidence of
[52:03] Destruction as the prophet of God speaks
[52:06] on this in just little little thoughts
[52:08] here and there and and forgive me if it
[52:10] sounds like I'm putting them together
[52:12] but I guess in reality I am uh the
[52:15] evidence of destruction in our nation is
[52:18] displayed very prominently in our young
[52:20] people our our children not our children
[52:24] but the the children it's very prominent
[52:26] it because there's nothing being done to
[52:29] help them find a balance in their life
[52:31] they simply say just let the children do
[52:34] what the children want to do and we'll
[52:36] touch on that in just a minute amen the
[52:38] very fabric of our nation we sit here
[52:41] today as Americans and and the fabric of
[52:44] our nation was built on the Constitution
[52:47] but you'll find that even that is now
[52:49] being slowly unwoven to achieve what man
[52:53] desires and we'll see that the very
[52:56] fabric of the church has been torn and
[52:59] it's there that we'll find that as I
[53:01] already kind of got ahead of myself that
[53:04] that the church has become a place of
[53:05] entertainment not of the word of God if
[53:08] a person preaches too hard I won't cite
[53:10] the case but Minister get a little move
[53:13] from God and preach a little bit too
[53:15] hard the church board has a meeting
[53:18] right after that and they tell him under
[53:20] certain clause in his contract amen the
[53:23] contracts between the church and the
[53:26] pastor not between God and the pastor
[53:29] and according to a contract that they're
[53:31] going to pull his contract because we
[53:34] don't want to be known as a church that
[53:37] is too hard my brother and sister what
[53:40] it is is they want to be entertained
[53:43] amen they're looking for someone as the
[53:45] prophet of God said that tall dark
[53:47] handsome guy only now it might be tall
[53:50] dark handsome woman I just was watching
[53:53] a little something I hope you don't mind
[53:55] I I've just decided to come out of the
[54:00] closet I I dig in some pretty probably
[54:02] you might think strange ways and looking
[54:05] at thoughts when something comes and I I
[54:07] want to find the root of it yes and when
[54:10] you find the root of it you you can then
[54:13] start to really understand how these
[54:15] things come down and how they start to
[54:18] grow and how all of a sudden you know
[54:20] being a farmer weeds are like you might
[54:23] say our arch enemy and if you don't pay
[54:25] attention a weed that is like this big
[54:28] in one week is this big and in two weeks
[54:31] is this big and in a month has taken
[54:33] over your garden that's it and so it's
[54:36] there that I I proceed to dig into these
[54:39] kind of things because I want to see
[54:40] where this route comes from and as you
[54:43] look at this you start to see my brother
[54:45] and sister that the church has come to a
[54:48] place that the appearance of the church
[54:50] is more important to them than the
[54:52] actual substance of the church and they
[54:55] want to look look like they are
[54:57] successful they have they have
[54:59] advertising campaigns and PR Specialists
[55:02] and they have all these kind of things
[55:04] but under the surface the prophet of God
[55:06] said they're
[55:07] rotten now Grace Tabernacle we need to
[55:10] hold one another accountable before the
[55:12] Lord amen that we don't come to a place
[55:15] that appearance becomes more important
[55:17] than having the word come into our life
[55:20] when appearance comes to the place that
[55:22] we need to make our song service perfect
[55:24] and and our our our our preaching
[55:27] perfect and uh the specials perfect and
[55:30] everybody looks and dresses perfect when
[55:32] that becomes we have failed we have not
[55:35] reached a level of prominence but we
[55:36] have reached a level of failure because
[55:39] we need to come and be organic
[55:41] Christians which means we're just who we
[55:43] are and that's the difference or what we
[55:45] can lift up is the very praise to our
[55:48] Lord Jesus Christ let our praise my
[55:50] brother and sister now I hope you
[55:52] understand this let our praise be
[55:54] perfect
[55:56] oh that doesn't mean we hit every note
[55:58] and we did this just right and that just
[56:00] right but our praise when it is perfect
[56:03] is acceptable to the Lord he says that I
[56:07] receive and I give blessing back for
[56:10] this praise I give a blessing to these
[56:12] people because I see their
[56:15] heart amen and we see the very fabric as
[56:17] I said of the church being torn and of
[56:20] the
[56:21] family my brother and sister you don't
[56:24] have to look very far to see the the
[56:26] fabric of the family is slowly being
[56:29] torn Satan's
[56:32] desire he doesn't care if we go to
[56:36] church he does not care one thing about
[56:39] where we go to church but if he can tear
[56:43] the fabric of the
[56:45] family then we sit in
[56:49] church we don't want to identify that we
[56:51] have struggle in our family we don't
[56:53] want to be open enough to say we're in
[56:56] chaos in our household but Satan's just
[56:59] happy to bring that and say you know
[57:01] what as long as it exists in that
[57:03] household there'll never be a Harmony in
[57:06] that household and it takes Harmony for
[57:08] us to come and mesh to the word I tell
[57:11] you I believe each every one of us
[57:13] myself included know what it's like when
[57:15] we come into the church to come to a
[57:17] service to worship and our spirit is
[57:20] torn our spirit is all rot up nothing is
[57:24] smooth and nothing is calm and we come
[57:26] to church and that very blessing that we
[57:28] could have received there we cannot
[57:31] receive because we're in an internal
[57:33] battle right and Satan knows that and
[57:36] then we walk away and say you know what
[57:39] I I have this issue I have that issue
[57:41] what you've got is a leodan issue that
[57:44] Satan hates you amen but when you
[57:47] recognize that it's Satan that's doing
[57:50] the hating amen then you can start to
[57:53] deal with these issues and then you can
[57:55] stand and and you can actually take a
[57:57] position I'll tell you I'll make a bold
[58:00] statement here I've been many times in
[58:02] my life where there was chaotic
[58:04] circumstances and knowing that I was
[58:06] going to minister I didn't come as some
[58:09] super spiritual man I come as a Son of
[58:11] God who believes the word and you come
[58:14] there and you bind every Spirit In The
[58:17] Name of Jesus Christ and the chaos my
[58:20] brother and sister is bound but if you
[58:23] don't bind it chaos runs rampant I've
[58:26] seen it in my life where children
[58:28] screaming and hollering running the
[58:30] aisles of a church service Message
[58:33] Church running the aisles of a church
[58:35] making noise and you stop and bind the
[58:38] spirit and those kids sit down put their
[58:40] hand in their lap no parent threatening
[58:42] them they'd already done
[58:45] that but the Holy Spirit coming bringing
[58:48] a peace and a Harmony and settling that
[58:51] down I say let we know the prophet said
[58:56] of George Washington Abraham Lincoln on
[58:58] every corner will not change the
[58:59] direction of the nation but I tell you
[59:01] you can pray for your nation because the
[59:03] prophet encouraged you to that it would
[59:06] be such for your benefit
[59:10] yes come on right I'm not into politics
[59:14] here but I'm just going to name it you
[59:16] think when God prophesied through the
[59:18] word and through a prophet what would
[59:20] happen in America you think Donald J
[59:22] Trump's going to change that no you
[59:25] think Mr Jo Biden or Camala Harris is
[59:27] going to change that my brother and
[59:29] sister when God spoke it nothing's going
[59:32] to change it and now let's roll this
[59:34] right over when God prophesied the word
[59:37] to you amen and he said you are going to
[59:40] have the rocky places made smooth and
[59:43] you are going to be an overcomer you're
[59:45] going to be brought into Perfection
[59:47] you're going to be brought into the very
[59:49] image of God do you think there's
[59:51] anything going to keep you from coming
[59:53] to that place amen amen amen he's the
[59:57] same yesterday today and forever he's
[1:00:00] the one who bound
[1:00:02] himself we didn't bind him he bound
[1:00:06] himself and made the Declaration amen
[1:00:09] hallelujah Isaiah I don't I don't
[1:00:12] remember yes I did it's there on the
[1:00:13] screen Isaiah 34 and5 and I will give
[1:00:17] children to be their princes and babes
[1:00:19] shall rule over them and the people
[1:00:21] shall be oppressed Everyone by another
[1:00:24] and Everyone by his neighbor the child
[1:00:27] shall behave himself proudly against the
[1:00:29] ancient or our elders and base Against
[1:00:32] The Honorable my brother and sister I
[1:00:34] can tell you this day this scripture is
[1:00:38] fulfilled this is a time my brother and
[1:00:42] sister look we have riots taking place
[1:00:44] in cities and and that when the police
[1:00:46] go to arrest them when they realize
[1:00:48] these kids are underage they know what
[1:00:50] kind of problem they'll have to
[1:00:52] prosecute them they just turn them loose
[1:00:55] who's in control
[1:00:56] that's right the
[1:01:07] children the Olympics anybody ever hear
[1:01:11] about
[1:01:12] them they're suddenly the only news
[1:01:14] there is on
[1:01:16] Earth what is the Olympics
[1:01:22] celebrating
[1:01:24] mankind men and women their
[1:01:29] abilities but look where we're coming
[1:01:32] they can do what they want I don't I
[1:01:34] don't really
[1:01:37] care now they're coming to a place
[1:01:41] openly mocking
[1:01:44] God oh this is horrible what are we
[1:01:47] going to do my goodness the world's
[1:01:48] falling apart no thank you Lord prophecy
[1:01:52] is being
[1:01:53] fulfilled amen the word of God is coming
[1:01:55] coming to pass in this day because it
[1:01:58] tell us that they would be those that
[1:02:00] would mock God and they would be those
[1:02:02] that would be derive and and they would
[1:02:05] demean and they would do these things
[1:02:07] this is the word coming to pass never in
[1:02:10] history even the ungodly are saying this
[1:02:12] is such a
[1:02:14] shift what happened here I'll tell you
[1:02:17] what happened my brother and sister the
[1:02:19] evil of the age is coming to the
[1:02:22] surface and we say oh Lord what are we
[1:02:24] going to do well I'll tell you what you
[1:02:26] do just be ready when it's over amen
[1:02:30] don't be then be one of those saying oh
[1:02:33] let me have your oil but be one full of
[1:02:35] oil be one prepared for the coming
[1:02:38] because we're seeing that come to pass
[1:02:41] amen
[1:02:42] hallelujah is it okay to be excited this
[1:02:45] morning amen so now they're openly
[1:02:48] mocking God these are the sounds of
[1:02:52] Destruction when you see how it used to
[1:02:55] be
[1:02:56] I'm not so old but I'm telling you it
[1:02:58] used to be that if a man used certain
[1:03:00] words on the radio or television they
[1:03:02] censored them it ended the career of
[1:03:05] many a broadcaster and many
[1:03:07] commentator but now they use the Vain
[1:03:10] and the
[1:03:11] vulgar and the one the fox is
[1:03:16] guarding the hen
[1:03:19] house and the fox says it's
[1:03:22] okay you know I never thought about that
[1:03:24] fox
[1:03:27] know okay yeah the fox has now got his
[1:03:31] own television station H
[1:03:35] my so look at this when we look at the
[1:03:39] word go back through the message and I
[1:03:41] trust that you know the message well
[1:03:42] enough to I don't have to explain this
[1:03:44] but my brother and sister the prophet of
[1:03:46] God told us that the Babylon Spirit
[1:03:48] Babylonian Spirit was spreading through
[1:03:51] the land it was the influence of Jezebel
[1:03:55] she didn't have to have her own TV show
[1:03:57] her own publication just the very spirit
[1:04:00] that was there and and Jezebel was the
[1:04:03] best dressed most articulate woman to
[1:04:06] ever be in the white house I mean in
[1:04:13] the and it was that influence let me
[1:04:16] tell you I can tell you where it
[1:04:20] started the prophet of God put it right
[1:04:22] back to Jackie Kennedy that's exactly
[1:04:25] right
[1:04:26] amen that water bowl or whatever they
[1:04:28] call it
[1:04:30] haircut you know so that seems so
[1:04:34] simple even the church World said well
[1:04:37] that doesn't you know but then they
[1:04:39] embraced
[1:04:41] it now I can show you where it started
[1:04:43] can you show me where it
[1:04:45] ended you should be able to amen it
[1:04:50] shows Babylon conquered by their very
[1:04:54] own teaching their very own life their
[1:04:57] very own action will conquer them amen
[1:05:01] look at Rome for an example God gave a
[1:05:03] great example in the beginning in
[1:05:05] Natural History are we doing okay amen
[1:05:08] so you see this coming to a place that
[1:05:11] it will be in this way that that that
[1:05:14] people they are not out here actively
[1:05:17] resisting they will say well we we don't
[1:05:19] like the direction I this comes from a
[1:05:22] conversation we don't like the direction
[1:05:25] that our church is going I got bold I
[1:05:27] said well why don't you find another
[1:05:29] church come visit us well we're not
[1:05:32] ready to leave yet they're still
[1:05:35] there because there's no resolve in them
[1:05:39] to actually suffer for the gospel no
[1:05:43] resolve to actually make sacrifice for
[1:05:45] the gospel they they don't like it but
[1:05:48] they're not uncomfortable boiling frogs
[1:05:51] in Babylon amen I don't know if you guys
[1:05:54] ever listened to that sermon but it's
[1:05:57] really good amen hallelujah you can find
[1:05:59] that at hick on Hickory uh their website
[1:06:03] amen the heat just slowly being turned
[1:06:05] up I don't like it or church is getting
[1:06:07] worldly are you going to leave
[1:06:10] no I mean after all a hot jacuzzi is
[1:06:14] maybe better than a cold
[1:06:16] jacuzzi and a lukewarm one's way more
[1:06:22] comfortable we'll just sit here croak
[1:06:25] croak
[1:06:26] croak croak
[1:06:28] croak I really don't like it but I don't
[1:06:31] like it enough to leave I don't like it
[1:06:34] enough to
[1:06:35] change prophet of God said desperation
[1:06:38] is what's going to drive this bride to
[1:06:41] be ready for the Rapture are we
[1:06:44] comfortable or are we desperate that's
[1:06:46] it come on my brother and sister it's
[1:06:49] easy to be comfortable and redefine
[1:06:51] Comfort over and over and over again I'm
[1:06:53] still comfortable I'm still comfortable
[1:06:55] everything is falling apart it's in a
[1:06:57] hand basket headed down the road but I'm
[1:07:00] still kind of
[1:07:04] comfortable music over here you know is
[1:07:07] invading the Christian world now
[1:07:09] invading the message and we don't like
[1:07:12] it but we're we're getting more
[1:07:13] comfortable the more times we hear it
[1:07:16] sing amen I just listened or heard I
[1:07:19] should say I didn't go pursue it I just
[1:07:21] heard it uh Christian music that was so
[1:07:24] baseless they never met mention God they
[1:07:26] never mention salvation it's just always
[1:07:29] he that's
[1:07:32] it well Lucifer yeah one of his pronouns
[1:07:36] is he that's
[1:07:38] right yeah that's right you got to be
[1:07:41] careful whose music cuz he likes
[1:07:44] it
[1:07:46] amen now I'm not really much of a push
[1:07:48] on music right I believe the holy spirit
[1:07:50] will uh move you to know what music is
[1:07:53] right what will will Grieve Your Spirit
[1:07:55] and what will lift you up but I'm
[1:07:57] telling you it can be so comfortable and
[1:08:00] so gradual that it takes a place of real
[1:08:03] worship we want worship my brother and
[1:08:06] sister that God would come in our church
[1:08:08] today and say this worship is pleasing
[1:08:12] to me because if he cannot give us a
[1:08:15] well done then it's not so well
[1:08:18] done
[1:08:20] H okay second Peter 3
[1:08:26] 3 to 5 knowing this first that there
[1:08:29] shall come in the last days so no no
[1:08:31] other age no other time the last day
[1:08:34] scoffers walking after their own
[1:08:37] lust I don't recommend I'm not going to
[1:08:40] tell anybody to go look at the Olympic
[1:08:42] thing but I'm telling you they had a
[1:08:44] whole display with tens of thousands or
[1:08:47] maybe hundreds of thousands of people
[1:08:49] cheering it on yeah
[1:08:53] scoffers turning the Last Supper into
[1:08:58] mockery and no one on earth said we
[1:09:00] should censor
[1:09:01] this virtually naked people painted up
[1:09:05] to look like demons and no one says we
[1:09:08] should censor
[1:09:12] this walking after their own lust and
[1:09:14] saying where is the promise of his
[1:09:16] coming now and let me say this this is
[1:09:18] going to sound so judgmental forgive
[1:09:23] me the scoffers are wanting to know
[1:09:25] where his coming is but if they haven't
[1:09:28] repented and got right with God they
[1:09:30] don't want to see his
[1:09:34] coming they'll scoff about where's his
[1:09:37] coming but in reality they don't want to
[1:09:39] see his coming because they realize what
[1:09:42] it
[1:09:45] is there's an innate something that's
[1:09:48] inh
[1:09:49] Humanity that knows that there is
[1:09:54] something for since the fathers fell
[1:09:56] asleep all things continue as they were
[1:09:58] from the beginning of the
[1:10:00] creation and I say this this is a
[1:10:04] scoffer speaking so I believe I can
[1:10:05] scoff the scoffers not all things
[1:10:09] continue on as they did from the
[1:10:12] creation amen for the word of God says
[1:10:15] the cup of iniquity is filling up that's
[1:10:18] right so that's not the same as it was
[1:10:21] in the beginning their iniquity
[1:10:23] babylon's very action is going to judge
[1:10:27] Babylon their iniquity is being caught
[1:10:30] in the cup and it is is coming forth at
[1:10:33] the time they think it's all right they
[1:10:35] can rewrite the scripture they can
[1:10:37] rewrite what Holiness is they can
[1:10:39] rewrite what the coming of the Lord
[1:10:40] Jesus Christ is they can rewrite it
[1:10:43] these things that we have are are no
[1:10:45] longer idolatry they're
[1:10:50] worship and they rewrite the definition
[1:10:52] of that but it would be that very
[1:10:55] rewriting of the definition is coming
[1:10:58] now as judgment will come as judgment
[1:11:01] upon
[1:11:02] them and in that time my brother and
[1:11:06] sister they'll look back and realize
[1:11:08] they actually duped
[1:11:12] themselves there's no greater fool than
[1:11:14] the fool who fools
[1:11:17] himself is it okay to speak like
[1:11:20] that see verse five covers this for this
[1:11:25] they willingly are ignorant of imagine
[1:11:28] being willingly
[1:11:30] ignorant it it's just really hard to
[1:11:32] Fathom how someone would have all the
[1:11:36] facts all the
[1:11:38] evidence I just watched a little video
[1:11:40] clip as on I don't know Christian
[1:11:43] broadcasting or something like that and
[1:11:45] they have found some evidence uh I think
[1:11:48] over uh you know holy land or something
[1:11:51] and creationists are desperately trying
[1:11:54] to find a way to prove Pro that this is
[1:11:56] not
[1:11:57] original because what happens is is when
[1:12:00] they keep finding these
[1:12:03] artifacts can I be humorous for a
[1:12:06] moment had somebody send me a deal of a
[1:12:09] picture of ancient the Museum of ancient
[1:12:13] Palestinian
[1:12:15] history have you guys seen
[1:12:18] that it's an empty room
[1:12:25] there's the museum empty room but you
[1:12:28] see what's happening in Israel even in a
[1:12:30] time of War they're suddenly coming up
[1:12:33] with these things it's being discovered
[1:12:35] it's being brought forth and it's like
[1:12:37] more proof more proof more proof and
[1:12:40] they are willingly ignorant of that
[1:12:43] truth that's
[1:12:44] right can I get real personal here this
[1:12:47] morning we got right here in this day
[1:12:50] Supernatural signs and wonders now don't
[1:12:52] misunderstand me you guys know where I
[1:12:54] stand but my brother and sister we're
[1:12:56] going to leave brother brandom entirely
[1:12:57] out of this picture here as much as we
[1:13:00] can we're going to put it right off to
[1:13:01] the side there has been so much evidence
[1:13:05] of the revealed word in this day I'm not
[1:13:07] talking about what a prophet did I'm
[1:13:09] talking about what you the bride are
[1:13:11] doing what is coming to pass right now
[1:13:14] amen is so much evidence a preponderance
[1:13:17] of evidence would be enough to convict
[1:13:19] anyone or to set them free and they
[1:13:23] willingly won't receive that no no he
[1:13:26] told this story like this and then told
[1:13:28] it again like this just like you do amen
[1:13:31] and it's there that we see the
[1:13:33] preponderance of evidence in the life of
[1:13:35] the bride of Christ is proving that God
[1:13:38] has called a bride has supernaturally
[1:13:40] prepared her to be delivered from this
[1:13:43] world and they willingly disregard that
[1:13:47] because they see it as facts that are
[1:13:52] contradictory when the preponderance of
[1:13:54] evidence is right before
[1:13:58] them I could go off into quite a few
[1:14:01] different explanations that have come up
[1:14:02] as I've been looking through these
[1:14:04] things but my brother and
[1:14:07] sister second Peter
[1:14:10] 33-5 they want to know where is the
[1:14:13] promise of his
[1:14:15] coming everything's just went on like it
[1:14:17] is and for this they willingly are
[1:14:20] ignorant of that by the word of God the
[1:14:23] heavens were of old and the Earth
[1:14:25] standing out of the water and in the
[1:14:28] water now I want to tie a little news
[1:14:30] fact with you right now down in
[1:14:32] California they have some neighborhoods
[1:14:34] in area right off the coast out there
[1:14:36] you might have caught this if I I look
[1:14:38] at the news online amen don't have a
[1:14:40] television look at the news online and
[1:14:42] this just keeps popping up in the news
[1:14:44] feed that these people have watched it
[1:14:46] started out their driveway cracked and
[1:14:49] then the street cracked and then it's
[1:14:51] there and now my brother and sister
[1:14:53] there is a 12T foot difference from the
[1:14:56] curb or the sidewalk to where their
[1:14:58] driveway used to be and they don't know
[1:15:00] what to do about it because it just
[1:15:03] continues to move and a prophet of God
[1:15:05] said California it's not going to blow
[1:15:08] up my brother and sister it's not going
[1:15:10] to do this or do that it's going to
[1:15:13] slide into the
[1:15:16] ocean and they're telling people in
[1:15:19] multi-million dollar homes telling them
[1:15:21] we'll no longer allow you to live in
[1:15:23] your own home even though their home is
[1:15:25] still somewhat stabilized one man at
[1:15:27] this point before they made that
[1:15:29] announcement had a 16t step ladder to
[1:15:32] get to his front
[1:15:33] door you something's going
[1:15:36] somewhere I'm telling you we're living
[1:15:38] in an age where something's going
[1:15:39] somewhere and the bride is not looking
[1:15:42] at that my brother and sister oh no it's
[1:15:44] sliding in the ocean the bride is
[1:15:46] looking at the word and the word says
[1:15:48] you're going somewhere and we know where
[1:15:51] we're going amen we're not going to
[1:15:54] worry about sliding in an ocean a
[1:15:56] tsunami an earthquake a volcano you know
[1:16:00] if you guys haven't seen it or not the
[1:16:03] greater Yellowstone
[1:16:05] Volcano has a circle that goes quite a
[1:16:09] ways past
[1:16:11] us really makes me
[1:16:15] nervous oh in Mountain Home Air Force
[1:16:18] Base is on Russia's list for a
[1:16:21] nuke to destroy their fighting ability
[1:16:25] nukes that have a 250 mile destruction
[1:16:31] radius anybody nervous yet I could keep
[1:16:35] going come on my brother and sister this
[1:16:38] is not what we're looking at this is not
[1:16:40] what we're living in the influence of
[1:16:42] this is not who we are we've been called
[1:16:45] by the word to come and be delivered
[1:16:48] from this
[1:16:50] situation amen now in the sermon hear ye
[1:16:53] himm brother Bram says this text we're
[1:16:55] speaking of tonight Jesus was taking
[1:16:58] three of his disciples for it is written
[1:17:01] in the word that in the mouth of two or
[1:17:04] three let every word be established do
[1:17:06] we have two or three that would speak
[1:17:08] together on the word today amen he set
[1:17:11] the
[1:17:12] scene oh just a
[1:17:16] second God was just about ready to do
[1:17:19] something and God never does anything
[1:17:21] without first he makes things ready he
[1:17:23] sets a scene for his great drama let me
[1:17:26] say this tonight if I never utter
[1:17:29] another word I believe that God is
[1:17:31] setting the scene for the greatest drama
[1:17:34] ever struck the Earth the reading of the
[1:17:37] church and the coming of his blessed son
[1:17:40] the Lord Jesus Christ Can someone say
[1:17:42] thank you Lord for that amen setting the
[1:17:45] scene for this to take place
[1:17:54] [Music]
[1:17:55] he's pulling his little flock together
[1:17:57] you thought you were doing
[1:17:59] it he's pulling
[1:18:01] you and showing the gospel in every sign
[1:18:05] and wonder in formed to the world that
[1:18:07] those who are partakers of the world
[1:18:09] will perish with the world and it is
[1:18:12] choosing time now amen and as he goes up
[1:18:16] to the Mount called Mount
[1:18:18] Transfiguration it must have been a
[1:18:19] wonderful place Peter later regarded it
[1:18:22] as the holy Mount he said that he was in
[1:18:25] now that doesn't mean that the mountain
[1:18:27] was
[1:18:28] holy H it meant the holy God was on the
[1:18:32] mountain oh I wish I could get you get
[1:18:35] that to you it's not the holy church
[1:18:38] it's a holy spirit in the church that
[1:18:41] makes it what it is it isn't the holy
[1:18:44] man it's the holy ghost in the man that
[1:18:48] makes him what he is now I want to tell
[1:18:51] you anybody make a mistake this last
[1:18:53] week you get a little upset how you know
[1:18:55] just a little whatever you want to call
[1:18:57] it amen I'm going to tell you that
[1:18:59] didn't cause God to leave you he just
[1:19:02] the prophet told us how he just sets up
[1:19:04] on the little Branch waits for our
[1:19:06] spirit to calm down but he's the one
[1:19:09] that's soothing your spirit amen so
[1:19:12] while we can say oh Lord I know that
[1:19:14] didn't please you he's there let me just
[1:19:16] use a PTY cat for an example he's there
[1:19:20] it's going to be all
[1:19:23] right it's going to be all right amen
[1:19:27] and when we finally
[1:19:29] go it's going to be all right he comes
[1:19:32] right down off the branch and he's
[1:19:33] sitting right with us
[1:19:35] again now isn't that an all-encompassing
[1:19:37] God Amen when you're all rough up by the
[1:19:40] world he's your calmer he's your peace
[1:19:43] amen and then when your peace is now
[1:19:45] manifested he comes right down and
[1:19:47] snuggles up to you again there's nothing
[1:19:50] better than that my brother and sister
[1:19:52] Hallelujah
[1:19:54] because you see in the age we're living
[1:19:56] in they've got a lot of holy
[1:20:00] things you go to Israel they got all
[1:20:02] kinds of holy
[1:20:06] spots holy spots that have signs out the
[1:20:09] doors please don't take your alcohol
[1:20:11] inside please don't take your cigarettes
[1:20:14] inside how holy is that my brother and
[1:20:17] sister when a people who claim to be
[1:20:18] holy live Unholy lives and want to
[1:20:22] celebrate the holiness
[1:20:25] by their
[1:20:26] unholiness no my brother and sister this
[1:20:28] is the day we're living
[1:20:30] in Hallelujah now I made a little
[1:20:32] comment brother Alex brother Chris in
[1:20:34] the back and now you'll see why I made
[1:20:36] the comment amen natural battles right
[1:20:38] we're seeing Israel uh Israel defending
[1:20:41] itself we're seeing uh uh you know some
[1:20:44] of the wars in Africa we're seeing
[1:20:46] things over here in in Asia all actively
[1:20:49] taking place natural battles amen and
[1:20:52] we're going to be my brother and sister
[1:20:54] as time goes on we're going to actually
[1:20:56] see that the greatest battle has already
[1:20:59] been prophesied to you and I it is not
[1:21:01] Gog and may goog it's not Armageddon
[1:21:04] it's the battle in your mind that's
[1:21:06] right amen the prophet of God didn't use
[1:21:08] those words greatest battle ever fought
[1:21:10] because it was a cool title he uh
[1:21:13] brought that out and and give that title
[1:21:15] because he knew this would be the battle
[1:21:18] of the age now I want to ask you is that
[1:21:20] true or
[1:21:21] not amen I tell you it's the the mind
[1:21:25] that causes us chaos it's the mind that
[1:21:28] miscommunicate it's the mind that
[1:21:30] misinterprets it's the mind that doesn't
[1:21:32] hear right it's a mind that doesn't
[1:21:34] speak right amen
[1:21:37] [Music]
[1:21:38] hallelujah so this greatest battle was
[1:21:41] supernaturally been revealed you wonder
[1:21:44] my brother and sister why people in
[1:21:45] chaos out here because they don't have a
[1:21:48] revelation of where the battle really is
[1:21:52] they think the battle is between husband
[1:21:53] and wife
[1:21:55] they think it's between uh what do they
[1:21:57] call them free whatever and the
[1:22:01] government our battle is with with the
[1:22:03] government no I'm sorry if they were
[1:22:05] running the government it would be just
[1:22:07] as
[1:22:09] corrupt just as
[1:22:12] evil so we have Revelation you did you
[1:22:15] ever think about greatest battle ever
[1:22:17] fought as a revelation that's
[1:22:20] right oh no Revelations when the Bible
[1:22:23] is opened up and Angels come come
[1:22:24] floating and fluttering down I'm telling
[1:22:27] you one of the greatest Revelations that
[1:22:29] been given to the bride of Christ is to
[1:22:31] recognize that thought that just went
[1:22:32] through your mind was not your thought
[1:22:35] God never claimed it as your thought
[1:22:37] never held you in judgment as it was
[1:22:39] your thought he recognize where that
[1:22:41] thought came from and he knows that your
[1:22:44] heart your thoughts are pure and holy
[1:22:47] and righteous but in the flesh we don't
[1:22:50] interpret it that way that's right but
[1:22:52] when you catch a revelation that the
[1:22:54] Great battle being fought in your
[1:22:56] daytoday life do I read my Bible or Not
[1:22:58] My Flesh says I'm too distracted as we
[1:23:01] pick up a novel and read it that's it
[1:23:04] that's exactly
[1:23:06] right I'm too
[1:23:10] tired come on my brother and sister I've
[1:23:12] shared this with the church I'll share
[1:23:13] it again I hope you don't mind but there
[1:23:15] come a time when I was pastoring the
[1:23:17] church here and we were farming a lot of
[1:23:19] acres and I literally was telling my
[1:23:21] wife I think I'm going to resign from
[1:23:22] being Pastor I I don't know why I didn't
[1:23:25] say I'm going to resign from
[1:23:28] farming I'm going to resign from
[1:23:30] pastoring the church because I can't do
[1:23:33] this it's just wearing me out working so
[1:23:37] many hours every day uh that that it's
[1:23:40] just
[1:23:40] ridiculous I and I know some people
[1:23:42] think I'm exaggerating to find yourself
[1:23:45] at the end of a year having worked like
[1:23:47] 2,800 hours you do the
[1:23:51] math it's
[1:23:53] brutal and I just was slowly convincing
[1:23:57] myself that if I have to give up
[1:24:00] something I'll give up pastoring the
[1:24:05] church and then the Lord one night spoke
[1:24:08] to me and said why don't you just ask
[1:24:09] for more
[1:24:12] strength well mostly because that's just
[1:24:14] too
[1:24:15] simple I've got nothing to fret over if
[1:24:18] I just have you know strength to do all
[1:24:20] of this I I I won't have anything that I
[1:24:23] can whine and cry about nothing I can
[1:24:26] lay down you know how many oh I'm sorry
[1:24:28] to be so personal but do you guys ever
[1:24:30] throw any spiritual
[1:24:33] Tantrums come
[1:24:35] on he I I'm telling the truth we throw
[1:24:38] spiritual Tantrums lord I can't believe
[1:24:40] what you're doing to
[1:24:42] me if you love me
[1:24:45] Lord if this was different I could serve
[1:24:47] you better wouldn't care if he gave you
[1:24:50] $100 million doar you'd still have the
[1:24:52] same exact battle
[1:24:54] only the scripture says that many
[1:24:57] Temptations

[1:25:52] Magog
[1:25:55] we're not
[1:25:56] worried
[1:25:59] about oh I won't pronounce it right the
[1:26:01] valley of
[1:26:06] mehto we stood on the mountain in Israel
[1:26:09] looked down into it and they said this
[1:26:11] has absolutely been proven history all
[1:26:15] of these things from the Hebrew and
[1:26:17] whatever and even your King James Bible

[1:26:31] battle amen we have already overcome
[1:26:36] that is not our battle amen no more than
[1:26:39] we're worried about the tribulation
[1:26:42] because the word of God showed us very
[1:26:44] clearly that God would not judge you for
[1:26:46] those things that have already been
[1:26:48] judged right he's not going to pull your
[1:26:50] sin from the sea of his forgetfulness
[1:26:52] he's not going to come back and
[1:26:54] you and when the bride judges herself oh
[1:26:57] thank God for communion amen thank God
[1:27:00] to be in communion with the Lord thank
[1:27:03] you that was good Hallelujah I just I
[1:27:05] just that was just the Lord I'm telling
[1:27:07] you I'm not touting brother Chris but
[1:27:09] just the fact that was a song that he
[1:27:11] chose my brother and sister I I just got
[1:27:14] a little excited a little flutter down
[1:27:16] in there because we have blessed
[1:27:18] communion and when we've been drawn into
[1:27:20] his presence what is on the outside of
[1:27:22] the veil no longer can concerns you and
[1:27:24] I we're not out here worried about oh
[1:27:27] the economy they're talking about
[1:27:29] hundreds of thousands of layoffs because
[1:27:31] the economy is slowing my brother and
[1:27:34] sister I live in God's economy you live
[1:27:36] in God's economy you don't live in the
[1:27:39] economy of Leo deia and I don't care if
[1:27:42] it gets tough God will send a word and
[1:27:45] your meal and oil will not run dry
[1:27:49] because God made that promise not
[1:27:52] man man's so worried about what will I
[1:27:54] do tomorrow I want to get a newer car I
[1:27:57] want to get a newer this a bigger house
[1:27:59] I want this and I want that I'm just as
[1:28:01] guilty I'm not speaking down to you I'm
[1:28:04] just as guilty but what I want more than
[1:28:06] anything is to live in God's economy I
[1:28:09] want to live in the word and watch that
[1:28:12] tree bloom and bring forth fruit my
[1:28:15] brother and sister not setting back well
[1:28:18] I I guess we better buckle up we'll have
[1:28:21] to go to church less cuz we won't be
[1:28:23] able to afford the gas
[1:28:25] ass well I'll tell you what my brother
[1:28:27] and
[1:28:28] sister this story comes out of Africa
[1:28:31] we're not lifting nothing up we're just
[1:28:33] telling you what God can do some
[1:28:35] brothers in a a Land Rover Cruiser
[1:28:37] whatever drove for hours out through the
[1:28:40] bush to a little town to preach and and
[1:28:44] the brothers see with with common sense
[1:28:47] if I can say it that way that doesn't
[1:28:49] really sound right but they drove into
[1:28:51] the little town where they're holding
[1:28:53] these servic
[1:28:55] and the one brother says we ought to put
[1:28:56] Petrol in the other brother says oh the
[1:28:59] service won't be all that long we'll
[1:29:02] just do it when we're headed back home
[1:29:04] sounded reasonable you know you're in a
[1:29:06] suit tie you don't want to smell like
[1:29:08] gasoline when you walk in
[1:29:10] church they get in there they start
[1:29:13] preaching those Believers start
[1:29:15] rejoicing start praising God start
[1:29:18] prayers being answered Deliverance is
[1:29:20] taking place and when they come out of
[1:29:22] the service that night
[1:29:24] just a supernatural event they come out
[1:29:27] of the service that night and they
[1:29:29] realize the gas station is
[1:29:33] closed and the one brother who is a
[1:29:35] little more familiar says well there is
[1:29:37] the one out at the intersection remember
[1:29:39] that guy lives there so even if we get
[1:29:41] there late uh we can get him to to um
[1:29:45] you know open up and give us gasoline
[1:29:47] they drive out there now the the gas
[1:29:49] gauge is on on
[1:29:52] empty they pull up up there and there's
[1:29:54] a sign on the door have gone to the
[1:30:00] city the one brother turns to the other
[1:30:02] one says what are we going to
[1:30:05] do isn't this
[1:30:07] human I guess we got nothing left but to
[1:30:11] pray we've exhausted all of our Human
[1:30:16] Solutions I guess we better pray
[1:30:19] now they prayed and the one brother says
[1:30:21] well there's actually in the morning
[1:30:24] we'll be a lot of traffic if we happen
[1:30:26] to run out of gas and most people carry
[1:30:28] a Jerry can with them so let's just go
[1:30:33] home they drive through the night they
[1:30:35] pull up at the one brother's house that
[1:30:37] owned the vehicle they shut it off they
[1:30:40] get out they go their ways go to bed
[1:30:43] come in the morning the brother and it
[1:30:45] won't
[1:30:47] start climbs underneath the vehicle and
[1:30:50] hits it
[1:30:54] this thing's
[1:30:59] empty or are we going to reason
[1:31:03] it we'd be late for church that was part
[1:31:05] I left out we'd be late for church but
[1:31:07] we ought to put gas in it the other
[1:31:08] brother says let's not be late for
[1:31:10] church let's just
[1:31:11] go my brother and sister where is the
[1:31:14] battle at that's right the battle is the
[1:31:18] Lord's it's not your battle it's his
[1:31:21] battle he's the one that's in control of
[1:31:23] the whole picture or he's not that's
[1:31:28] right is the Lord in control
[1:31:36] today no sir he is in control amen amen
[1:31:42] can you say that with me he is in
[1:31:45] control amen we think we got these Petty
[1:31:49] battles we think we got our circumstance
[1:31:51] it's different nobody understands my
[1:31:52] deal I'll tell you what we do understand
[1:31:55] as Believers he is in
[1:32:00] control
[1:32:02] amen we don't face
[1:32:04] Armageddon armageddon's not our battle
[1:32:07] my brother and sister the bride's gone
[1:32:09] amen Allelujah can we say that we're
[1:32:12] gone amen we're out of here our
[1:32:18] battle see now you can take this
[1:32:21] back brother Brown talked about how it
[1:32:23] was at this stage of time a few
[1:32:26] people and and and if any of this
[1:32:28] applies to you please don't feel like
[1:32:30] I'm criticizing or don't feel you know
[1:32:32] judged but brother Brown talks about how
[1:32:34] at this certain time there was a certain
[1:32:36] amount of the American public was taking
[1:32:38] a a pill to go to bed or sleep or
[1:32:41] whatever and you know and how and then
[1:32:43] the number increased radically I wonder
[1:32:45] what it is today yeah you know I tell
[1:32:50] you what you go they got a pill for
[1:32:51] everything yeah amen what they don't
[1:32:54] have is Christ but they've got a pill
[1:32:57] going to trade a sound mind for a pill
[1:33:01] now don't miss understand me I'm not
[1:33:02] judging on this every once in a while
[1:33:05] you know I might take a aspirin or a
[1:33:08] whatever it is I've taken a pain pill
[1:33:10] before Etc and we're not judging it that
[1:33:14] way but you see our battle is in our
[1:33:16] mind and there's a spirit of anxiety
[1:33:20] that blankets a whole nation it's not
[1:33:21] just you it blankets a whole nation wait
[1:33:24] a whole
[1:33:25] world this Spirit of anxiety has people
[1:33:28] so nervous what's going to happen and
[1:33:31] depressed my brother and sister
[1:33:33] depression and fear amen and you know
[1:33:35] what happens is all of these little isms
[1:33:38] cause a lack of confidence in oursel and
[1:33:40] we look at oursel and say I must be
[1:33:42] defective but I want to tell you how
[1:33:44] strong Spirits are spirits are so strong
[1:33:47] that you can walk into a house we have
[1:33:50] done this in South America walk in a
[1:33:53] house and the people sitting there
[1:33:55] almost sitting there in tears a whole
[1:33:57] family just in such chaos and come and
[1:34:01] by God's grace be able to speak the word
[1:34:04] and encourage them and take them back to
[1:34:06] the word and reach in I hope you don't
[1:34:08] mind me put it in this way but I reached
[1:34:09] into their mind by the leadership of the
[1:34:12] Holy Spirit and started stirring up
[1:34:14] their pure mind not a defective mind not
[1:34:18] a weak mind not a mind that's not God's
[1:34:21] but a pure mind and starts to turn in
[1:34:24] that up and you just watch the
[1:34:25] atmosphere change in that room and all
[1:34:28] of a sudden things start to come to pass
[1:34:31] and a sister that had a case of
[1:34:33] depression on her amen she comes and
[1:34:35] says brother Paul pray for me I'm not my
[1:34:39] brother and sister the answer to
[1:34:41] anyone's problem but I serve a God who
[1:34:44] is and you pray for them and that Spirit
[1:34:47] was broken and that s sister returned
[1:34:50] back into the church and started serving
[1:34:52] God again being a wife to her husband
[1:34:55] mother to her children and worshiping
[1:34:57] the house of God why because we serve an
[1:35:01] awesome God we don't serve a God that
[1:35:04] abandons Us in the desert leaves us on
[1:35:06] the side of the road as a broken
[1:35:08] individual but we serve a powerful God
[1:35:11] can we say Amen this morning we serve a
[1:35:14] powerful God and I'll tell you what
[1:35:17] happens when we get a lack of confidence
[1:35:20] in
[1:35:22] ourself we get a lack of confidence in
[1:35:29] God it's that
[1:35:32] simple might sound like well that's just
[1:35:35] too
[1:35:36] simple but I tell you
[1:35:38] what have you ever notice the difference
[1:35:40] in your own life and approach to life
[1:35:43] when you're prayed up and when you're
[1:35:45] not prayed
[1:35:46] up that's right come on that's right
[1:35:50] when you are prayed up the devil is this
[1:35:53] small obscure noisy individual in the
[1:35:57] corner that's right and when you are not
[1:35:59] prayed up he's 10 feet tall he's a giant
[1:36:04] and he controls your life that's it and
[1:36:08] that my brother and sister is the mind
[1:36:11] in the midst of the
[1:36:13] battle from one moment to
[1:36:17] another remember brother brandham prayer
[1:36:20] line that woman there oh you got a
[1:36:22] nervous condition
[1:36:25] oh I I see they called you a
[1:36:31] witch go watch it you'll see that woman
[1:36:34] just starts to
[1:36:37] tremble and then she's set
[1:36:39] free we'll close out in a minute with a
[1:36:42] quote here that you'll see why I'm
[1:36:44] making emphasis on this she's standing
[1:36:46] there falling apart
[1:36:49] mentally and it's touching her physical
[1:36:52] body because of what someone anointed by
[1:36:55] a devil said about
[1:36:58] her but she turned an
[1:37:01] ear to what they
[1:37:05] said
[1:37:06] Amen brother Danny steeman preached the
[1:37:09] sermon it's quite some time back we need
[1:37:11] to get the re uh
[1:37:14] revelation of delete and
[1:37:18] block and when we delete the devil and
[1:37:21] then block him right amen that voice no
[1:37:26] longer applies to you
[1:37:32] amen it's pretty awesome once in a while
[1:37:35] to
[1:37:36] uh steal ideas from other
[1:37:40] brothers yeah I was sitting there in the
[1:37:43] chair you know in the office watching
[1:37:45] brother Danny preach that and I'm just
[1:37:46] like so
[1:37:48] good oh Paul he was talking to you
[1:37:54] that's probably what made it good
[1:37:57] yeah see no confidence in yourself of
[1:38:00] who you are this is why a revelation of
[1:38:02] knowing that you are a son or daughter
[1:38:03] of God is so important cuz when the
[1:38:06] devil says you're a sinner you're lost
[1:38:07] you're weak you're this you're that or
[1:38:09] whatever you can sit there and say you
[1:38:11] know what in all reality devil from your
[1:38:13] point of view it's true but I'm here
[1:38:16] I've got blood covering me I've got the
[1:38:18] word covering me I'm living in the
[1:38:20] presence of God and that's not what he
[1:38:23] says about me he says I am righteous and
[1:38:26] I am Holy and I am his and that's all
[1:38:30] that matters it's not what you said
[1:38:32] devil I'm going to block you and I'm
[1:38:35] going to delete your
[1:38:37] message
[1:38:39] amen I need to hurry somebody pray that
[1:38:43] Paul
[1:38:44] hurries
[1:38:45] amen look look at the day we're living
[1:38:47] in is this not a daily onslaught of the
[1:38:51] devil come on my brother and and sister
[1:38:53] it's a daily Onslaught amen
[1:38:59] hallelujah Satan's Relentless
[1:39:02] attack you know it it it used to be that
[1:39:05] the devil would just come and you know
[1:39:07] he would do a little something here and
[1:39:09] do a little something there but you see
[1:39:11] he sees the clock unwinding his own self
[1:39:13] he he recognizes signs of the times and
[1:39:16] as that clock is unwinding he's looking
[1:39:18] at this and he says I got to turn this
[1:39:20] up and it's now become an unrelenting
[1:39:24] yeah voice that says just go live go
[1:39:27] live your life is short your life you
[1:39:30] know do this enjoy your youth enjoy all
[1:39:33] of this just do
[1:39:36] it I preached that the other day I don't
[1:39:38] know if it really soaked in so much or
[1:39:40] something to remember but remember my
[1:39:43] brother and sister the devil would like
[1:39:44] you to trade this
[1:39:47] life for eternal
[1:39:50] life and the Lord would like you to
[1:39:52] trade this life
[1:39:54] for eternal
[1:39:56] life the devil says live it up and God
[1:40:00] says take as much of eternal life as you
[1:40:03] can get a hold of same message see how
[1:40:07] close it is twins right in the midst
[1:40:10] live life to the fullest the devil's got
[1:40:12] a whole pile of cigarettes and alcohol
[1:40:14] and women and and men and whatever else

[1:44:55] everything but the ultimate of it my

[1:45:10] room we can walk in he's already taken
[1:45:13] us into that little room and deposited
[1:45:15] himself in
[1:45:17] us and then I'm going to skip over a
[1:45:20] couple
[1:45:21] things or not
[1:45:24] now look at this 2 Corinthians 10 3-5
[1:45:26] though we walk in the flesh we do not
[1:45:28] war after the flesh for the weapons of
[1:45:31] our war Warfare are not carnal But
[1:45:34] Mighty amen through God to the pulling
[1:45:37] down of strongholds casting down
[1:45:40] imagination and every High thing that
[1:45:42] exalteth itself against the knowledge of
[1:45:44] God and bringing into captivity every
[1:45:47] thought to The Obedience of Christ my
[1:45:50] brother and sister this is speaking of a
[1:45:52] war Warfare right here every portion of
[1:45:55] this right here is talking about this
[1:45:57] Warfare going on it's not talking about
[1:46:00] to to bind ourselves with weapons and
[1:46:03] this and that and and you know be a
[1:46:06] prepper I believe in
[1:46:08] prepping I've been prep prepping but I'm
[1:46:11] more worried about the power going
[1:46:13] out amen ought to have a little extra
[1:46:16] water a little something you don't mind
[1:46:18] you know maybe 100 200 boxes of granola
[1:46:21] bars
[1:46:23] made with all kinds of stuff you can't
[1:46:25] pronounce so that they'll survive even a
[1:46:28] nuclear blast and still be
[1:46:30] edible and the only other thing that
[1:46:32] will survive the nuclear blast is
[1:46:34] cockroaches and so maybe you and the
[1:46:36] Cockroaches can sit down and have lunch
[1:46:39] together amen come on what do we need to
[1:46:43] be Preppers for come on are We any
[1:46:46] Preppers here we want to be Preppers the

[1:46:59] know Satan wants you to think you're
[1:47:02] defenseless come
[1:47:04] on can't change your
[1:47:07] situation but the prophet of God shows
[1:47:09] us so clearly I cut a bunch of this out
[1:47:11] we're empowered by the word nothing else
[1:47:14] amen my brother and sister we're not
[1:47:15] empowered by the church or the pastor or
[1:47:18] whatever it is we're empowered by the
[1:47:19] word amen and you know it's not even how
[1:47:22] much we can quote

[1:48:05] idolator cursing drinking all of these
[1:48:08] things but because you can speak 250
[1:48:11] script no come on it's not about how
[1:48:15] much we can quote my brother and sister

[1:48:36] IQ he sees you by the
[1:48:38] heart hallelujah we're not defenseless
