[33:02] yeah go ahead and put that up i put
[33:05] together a few slides tonight so we'll
[33:07] see how this goes for us
[33:14] so to my title tonight this uh we're
[33:18] speaking on expressions of eternity part
[33:20] two and title is the spoken word
[33:24] and we're going to turn the bibles to
[33:27] genesis chapter 1
[33:28] [Music]
[33:29] verse 1
[33:32] the very beginning of the bible praise
[33:38] the lord
[33:39] in the beginning god created the heaven
[33:41] and the earth and the earth was without
[33:43] form
[33:44] and void and darkness was upon the face
[33:47] of the deep
[33:48] and the spirit of god moved upon the
[33:50] face of the waters
[33:51] and god said let there be light and
[33:54] there was light
[33:55] and god saw the light that it was good
[33:58] and god divided the light from darkness
[34:00] and god called the light day and the
[34:03] darkness he
[34:04] called night and the evening and the
[34:06] morning were the first day
[34:08] revelations 22 from genesis to
[34:11] revelations
[34:17] if your revelation doesn't move all the
[34:19] way through the bible
[34:21] you might have to double check it
[34:25] [Music]
[34:27] revelations 22 or just discard it
[34:33] revelations 22 it's okay to smile
[34:36] tonight
[34:37] revelations 22 verse 18. i know it's
[34:40] hard to smile when you're tired
[34:42] praise the lord for i testify unto every
[34:45] man that heareth the words of the
[34:46] prophecy of this book if any man shall
[34:48] add unto these things
[34:50] god shall add unto him the plagues that
[34:52] are written in this book
[34:53] and if any man shall take away from the
[34:55] words of the book of this prophecy
[34:57] god shall take away his part out of the
[34:59] book of life and out of the holy city
[35:01] and from the things
[35:02] which are written in this book it's
[35:05] about our heads
[35:07] heavenly father lord jesus we ask you to
[35:10] just come down tonight lord
[35:12] father i have few notes nor we're
[35:16] relying completely upon you but that is
[35:18] how you designed it from the beginning
[35:19] lord
[35:20] it's never been about me it's never been
[35:22] about any man lord but it's been about
[35:25] you father
[35:26] it's been about your your relationship
[35:28] with us father
[35:29] and what can be said across this sacred
[35:32] desk tonight lord to strengthen that
[35:33] relationship because at the end of the
[35:35] day father that's
[35:36] really all that matters without that
[35:39] relationship father
[35:40] our life is a dead end it's not that
[35:42] relationship father we
[35:44] find ourselves completely separated but
[35:47] god
[35:48] lord true life is a relationship with
[35:51] you father
[35:52] i pray tonight you would speak to our
[35:54] hearts lord move aside mine
[35:56] my nerves lord my opinions my thoughts
[36:00] lord that we will
[36:01] be totally harnessed by your word by
[36:04] your will by your spirit lord
[36:06] we ask that you will just come down now
[36:09] lord father may you speak lip to ear
[36:11] lord jesus and father
[36:13] may you inspire your children tonight
[36:15] inspire them beyond father this
[36:18] flesh inspire them beyond their own
[36:21] ideas
[36:21] inspire them father beyond what someone
[36:24] else may have told them father that your
[36:26] revelation would pierce and divide
[36:28] father
[36:29] the ideas of man lord and that father
[36:31] you would come and take
[36:32] full complete control we love you lord
[36:35] and thank you in jesus christ's name we
[36:36] pray
[36:37] amen praise the lord
[36:42] you may be seated
[36:46] i know it's that awkward like everyone
[36:48] knows we sit down now but he didn't say
[36:50] it
[36:53] praise the lord so
[36:59] brother branham says in the cruelty of
[37:00] sin and the penalty that it costs to rid
[37:03] sin from our lives 1955
[37:06] i can see this little halo move over
[37:09] over this world which was merely a
[37:11] cinder frozen
[37:12] hanging out there like a great iceberg
[37:15] and he moved it over near the sun
[37:17] and he began to turn it like that around
[37:19] the sun and
[37:20] it began to melt and the big ice
[37:22] glaciers tore loose
[37:24] texas was being formed and the planes
[37:26] there as were taught how the icebergs
[37:28] were
[37:28] icebergs come down through there best
[37:31] chronolog
[37:32] chronologists can figure out
[37:35] and then the whole world after it run
[37:37] down into the gulf
[37:38] of mexico and so forth began to burn up
[37:42] with water
[37:43] and the world without form and void now
[37:45] we're in genesis 1 see now then
[37:46] god moved and separated the firmament
[37:49] from the waters
[37:50] and he made the light praise lord
[37:53] is that the right one okay i'd like that
[37:55] view better if that's right
[37:58] praise the lord so oh it goes back and
[38:01] forth all right so
[38:02] when the when god began to
[38:06] when god had the vision to express
[38:11] when god had the desire to express his
[38:13] vision for the world
[38:14] there was nothing there was as
[38:18] a genesis says though earth was without
[38:20] form and void but
[38:21] as we know in in the in the message we
[38:23] learned that the seeds were actually
[38:25] already in the ground
[38:27] but yet god had to speak over those
[38:30] seeds god had to speak
[38:31] over the the earth god had to bring
[38:35] forth the light
[38:36] and the light is what brought forth the
[38:39] life
[38:39] right so but with within these seeds
[38:42] laying within
[38:43] the world or the on the earth was the
[38:47] life and so
[38:48] then then came the light
[38:51] and uh it's god spoke it it was it was
[38:53] an expression of
[38:55] god or the logos because god was not god
[38:58] yet at that point
[38:59] it was an expression he had and we know
[39:01] that following
[39:02] following on with our title that this
[39:04] was an expression
[39:06] of eternity so god had a desire before
[39:09] anything ever was out there it was just
[39:11] blackness
[39:12] god had a desire to speak and bring
[39:15] forth
[39:16] the earth as we know it and his desire
[39:18] didn't stop there he then had a desire
[39:20] to bring forth
[39:21] life upon the earth to bring forth you
[39:23] and i
[39:24] so that we could make him god because
[39:26] god is an
[39:28] object of worship so as god spoke over
[39:31] the
[39:32] the earth whoops their
[39:35] life began to come forth from those
[39:36] seeds that lay down in there
[39:38] see god when god does stuff that's why
[39:41] science can
[39:42] can tap into this and say oh no we we
[39:44] can prove evolution because
[39:46] god is so great he does things in order
[39:51] so he created the seed why couldn't he
[39:53] just have spoken
[39:56] this little plant and it just appeared
[39:59] because his design was a seed
[40:02] being watered and nurtured with light
[40:05] coming down upon that seed to bring
[40:07] forth
[40:08] life upon it see god has a program and
[40:11] god's program always follows
[40:13] god's word amen praise the lord and so
[40:16] there there was no manifestation of god
[40:20] there was no manifestation of god
[40:23] until he expressed from eternity his
[40:27] vision and that was the spoken word
[40:31] sorry it's a little bit distracting i'm
[40:32] sorry so the manifestation of god
[40:35] there was nothing from god until he
[40:37] expressed his vision from
[40:39] eternity through the spoken word brother
[40:42] branham preaches the message spoken word
[40:43] is the original seed and after we preach
[40:45] the sermon
[40:46] you should go listen to that at some
[40:48] point
[40:49] between now and but
[40:52] he says in 1962 he says now after i have
[40:55] told you why i believe the word and what
[40:57] god said about it
[40:58] how it should not be taken or added to
[41:01] taken from
[41:02] i want to go into the dense part of it
[41:04] to contact
[41:06] to the context of this long text that i
[41:08] have drawn
[41:09] out and explain to you and show you
[41:12] what happened then you can see the
[41:15] reason i believe what i believe
[41:19] it says a turning point message that he
[41:21] that he ministered
[41:23] and the title uh really says it all
[41:25] right
[41:26] people rattle off the title sometimes
[41:29] just uh but they'll never stop to think
[41:32] about it
[41:39] he goes on to say he says and you can
[41:41] see the reason i believe what i believe
[41:42] see now it cannot be mixed and it will
[41:45] not hybrid with nothing else
[41:47] it will not hybrid why because it's the
[41:50] original
[41:51] today is a great day of high breeding
[41:53] animals corn wheat
[41:55] making a better looking product but it's
[41:57] no good it's rotten there's no life in
[42:00] it
[42:00] dies can't reproduce itself it's dead
[42:03] because everything that we have
[42:05] on earth today in its original form is a
[42:08] spoken word of god
[42:09] so in other words god from the beginning
[42:11] he spoke out in
[42:12] in over the the earth that was without
[42:14] form and void there was nothing he spoke
[42:17] out life came
[42:18] her light came and produced life upon
[42:20] the face of the earth and you say oh
[42:22] well when a plant grows up and it dies
[42:23] that's the end of the plant but the
[42:25] thing of it is about god's word is that
[42:27] it continues on so that plant dies but
[42:29] guess what its
[42:30] death brings forth another life and just
[42:33] how christ he came down and he died on
[42:36] the cross
[42:36] his death brought forth life within you
[42:40] because you see his he could you know
[42:42] it's like
[42:44] the devil thought he had him at that day
[42:46] on calvary but
[42:47] if you would have known and believed the
[42:50] word he would have known there was no
[42:51] possible way regardless of what they did
[42:53] did to him regardless of his death
[42:56] that could stop him because because even
[42:59] christ jesus himself
[43:01] walking the shores of galilee was an
[43:03] expression of eternity was a spoken word
[43:05] so it had to continue on
[43:09] it had to continue on and so because
[43:12] because
[43:13] mary the the holy spirit the angel told
[43:15] mary the holy spirit will overshadow you
[43:18] and bring forth and bring forth the holy
[43:21] spirit overshadow you and you'll be with
[43:22] child
[43:23] right so that very cells that were
[43:26] placed in her womb
[43:28] that was an expression of eternity that
[43:30] was the spoken word
[43:34] so the spoken word cannot
[43:37] stop there is no end
[43:40] to the spoken word and that spoken word
[43:44] is an expression
[43:45] of eternity so he goes on to say he says
[43:48] because everything we have on earth
[43:50] today in its original form is a spoken
[43:52] word of god we still have trees when god
[43:54] created the earth
[43:55] however many years ago there was trees
[43:57] guess what they're still trees
[43:59] it's a continuation the seed bringing
[44:02] forth
[44:02] life of itself right but he says that's
[44:05] why that a mule a bastard born
[44:07] an animal with a cross breeding cannot
[44:10] breed itself back again
[44:12] because who came up with the mule man
[44:15] man's idea cannot continue on
[44:19] this is good tonight it's like a bible
[44:21] study you know sometimes a preacher has
[44:23] an idea in his head and what his sermon
[44:24] is going to be like and then he comes
[44:25] out and he has to
[44:27] he has to follow the leading of the holy
[44:29] spirit and it changes
[44:31] praise the lord but you just have to
[44:34] make yourself relax and say whatever
[44:36] god's idea for tonight was
[44:38] well that's the best one praise the lord
[44:40] so
[44:42] a man a man-made idea now
[44:46] we say we say we say these idioms
[44:49] man's idea man's organizations and i
[44:52] feel like sometimes
[44:54] they come in one ear and go out the
[44:56] other and then we go out tomorrow
[44:58] and we accept man's ideas because we did
[45:02] church last night
[45:04] but the thing what is is you have to ask
[45:06] yourself
[45:08] is who i'm spending time with feeding me
[45:11] life that's even in your friends that's
[45:15] even in your in in
[45:16] you know the atmospheres that we go is
[45:19] it breeding life now we have to
[45:21] sometimes
[45:22] be in atmospheres that we don't
[45:23] appreciate because of work
[45:25] but you can carry that atmosphere of
[45:28] christ around with you
[45:30] so man comes up with something
[45:36] but it might look like a really good
[45:38] idea
[45:40] it might sound really good but you give
[45:42] it time
[45:44] if you can't okay you give it time to
[45:46] see what'll happen but you take
[45:48] that idea back to the word
[45:51] if you can't find it
[45:54] if you can't understand it if you don't
[45:56] catch a revelation of it
[45:58] put it on the shelf as they say that
[46:00] doesn't mean you give up and say well i
[46:02] can't understand this
[46:03] the messed whole message is false i'm
[46:05] sorry dude
[46:06] most of you understand exactly how your
[46:08] car works
[46:10] no but you still drive it every day you
[46:13] don't park it on the side
[46:14] and say never mind i'll walk you keep
[46:17] driving it
[46:21] what will happen if you accept man's
[46:24] idea
[46:25] is there will be no seed
[46:31] well what's the great controversy in the
[46:32] message today is
[46:34] the tent vision we just heard this on
[46:37] sunday
[46:38] what what's happening in the tent
[46:42] it's you receiving seed
[46:45] from christ which is
[46:48] the spoken word which is the original
[46:52] seed
[46:54] so when you go in there you receive seed
[46:56] of christ
[47:00] listen a woman that's pregnant
[47:03] aside from that space of time whose
[47:06] their womb is sealed they can't get
[47:08] pregnant again they're two months three
[47:09] months pregnant there's it's not they're
[47:11] not going to get pregnant on top of that
[47:13] the same natural always types of
[47:15] spiritual once you receive the seed of
[47:17] god
[47:17] thank you jesus you cannot receive man's
[47:20] idea
[47:21] that's why you can say i don't
[47:22] understand why this person
[47:24] does that when it's not it doesn't line
[47:28] up with the word
[47:30] perhaps their womb is not sealed
[47:35] and i'm talking about extreme cases
[47:37] where it's blatantly obvious
[47:40] and they've been faithfully taught so he
[47:43] goes on to say he says because
[47:45] everything that we have on earth today
[47:46] in its original form is a spoken word of
[47:48] god
[47:48] that's why that a mule i read that part
[47:52] god made a horse and he made it and he
[47:54] made a donkey
[47:55] you breed them two together you got a
[47:57] mule see
[47:58] they're both god's thoughts the horse
[48:02] and the donkey our spoken word
[48:06] but see it was not god's plan that a
[48:09] donkey
[48:12] breeds with a horse you see you see how
[48:15] tricky the devil is right
[48:16] it would say if it would deceive the
[48:18] very like it would deceive the very left
[48:20] if
[48:20] it were possible because it's so close
[48:23] say well
[48:24] god made the horse and god made the
[48:25] donkey
[48:27] and my pastor made the mule so it's got
[48:31] to be right
[48:32] right i can find it in the message
[48:35] i can find the horse and the message i
[48:36] can find the donkey in the mess i can
[48:37] find both of these in the bible
[48:39] but guess what you can't find now this
[48:42] is spiritually speaking not
[48:43] physically you can't find the mule in
[48:45] the bible
[48:47] and that's the tricky part right because
[48:49] you say oh this side the horse came from
[48:51] the message in the
[48:52] and the bible and the donkey came from
[48:54] the bible and the message
[48:55] but those two together don't follow both
[48:59] any doctrine you pull out of the bible
[49:01] has to line up with the message
[49:02] any doctrine you pull out of the message
[49:04] has to line up with the bible
[49:06] i say this tongue in cheek if i read
[49:08] something from the message that's
[49:09] contrary to the bible
[49:10] guess what that's false doctrine now we
[49:13] know
[49:13] by revelation that everything for that
[49:16] was said
[49:18] right in the message lines up with the
[49:20] bible
[49:21] even but you even see that's why you
[49:23] have to pay attention because
[49:24] brother branham in the early days says
[49:26] love was the evidence of the holy ghost
[49:29] but it wasn't that was contrary to the
[49:30] bible but you see
[49:32] that's why you have to take the whole
[49:34] thing you can't just pull this out i as
[49:37] a minister of the gospel i can't pull a
[49:39] quote
[49:42] to support an idea unless that idea is
[49:44] supported throughout
[49:45] the message and the bible you say well
[49:47] you just you just
[49:48] when you preach you just read quotes yes
[49:51] i read summaries
[49:52] excerpts of the idea but that thought
[49:55] that idea
[49:56] doesn't come from me it comes from
[49:58] christ
[50:00] and that thought expressed through the
[50:02] preaching of the word is going to what
[50:03] bring
[50:04] overshadowing the holy spirit upon your
[50:06] womb
[50:07] of your soul that's why you need the
[50:09] preaching of the word and we're going to
[50:10] get into that
[50:13] it's hybrid therefore it can't breed
[50:15] itself back so in other words there is
[50:17] no continuation of life
[50:20] that's why sometimes you see that
[50:21] there's a church right years ago it
[50:23] raised up it was it was dynamic the
[50:25] pastor's dynamic then the pastor died
[50:29] and the church died because there was no
[50:32] christ there was no spoken word
[50:36] we're going to he goes on to say he says
[50:37] we're going to hit the serpent seat
[50:38] after a while now it can't breed
[50:41] itself back
[50:44] it's okay to say amen this is the word
[50:46] it's not my idea
[50:49] you're like the pastor's not here what's
[50:51] he gonna say
[50:53] the spoken word continues to live on
[50:57] if you receive the revelation of the
[51:00] word
[51:01] that's going to bring forth life
[51:04] what is that life going to look like now
[51:07] i i
[51:08] speak in in the physical is that going
[51:10] to look like
[51:12] short skirts is that going to look like
[51:15] makeup is that going to look like
[51:19] you know a guy with a shirt so tight you
[51:21] can see his ribs
[51:23] hey you you didn't have to say that
[51:25] before i don't know
[51:26] i mean i'm only 28 so i don't remember
[51:28] but you got a preset now
[51:30] because people are walking around you're
[51:31] like bro
[51:33] that's about four sizes too small
[51:39] skinny jeans there's an
[51:42] expression from within it's hard
[51:45] sometimes when you
[51:47] i have i know people like this it's hard
[51:49] sometimes when
[51:50] when you hear when you hear them speak
[51:52] you're like oh it sounds good it lines
[51:54] up with the message but then their life
[51:56] doesn't and it it boggles you it's hard
[51:59] to look
[52:00] past but what what what would cause
[52:04] somebody
[52:04] to to to know what to say
[52:08] but their life not mess up match up
[52:11] it's in their head there's a song you
[52:14] take that
[52:15] they take it from my head down to my
[52:17] heart
[52:19] because when it's in your head lord help
[52:23] me to say this right
[52:24] not to sound blasphemous when it's in
[52:26] your head
[52:27] though it's the word it's just an idea
[52:31] of yours it's a man idea but
[52:34] that spoken word when it makes it into
[52:37] your heart
[52:38] it'll bring forth life why because the
[52:40] mind isn't
[52:41] isn't a betting ground
[52:44] your soul is your heart is so the word
[52:47] can't grow what i'm trying to say is the
[52:50] word can't grow in your head
[52:53] it's like you put a seed on out you take
[52:55] a seed
[52:56] and you set it on a slab of concrete you
[52:59] can dump
[53:00] all the water on it you can dump all the
[53:03] emotion
[53:05] on top of it you can go to camp
[53:08] on top of it guess what nothing's going
[53:11] to happen
[53:12] because and that that that that um
[53:16] praise the lord that seed can can start
[53:19] to
[53:20] to soak up soak up that moisture maybe
[53:23] you see a little bit of that sign there
[53:25] but you know just like the bible says
[53:26] you sow on the rocky ground it springs
[53:28] up fast but it dies
[53:30] because there's no sustaining power
[53:32] there i don't where
[53:33] where are we going amen praise the lord
[53:36] so
[53:36] everything god created on this earth
[53:40] continues to bring forth
[53:41] of its kind the spoken words and
[53:43] expression of eternity
[53:45] this message has to continue to bring
[53:48] forth of its kind
[53:51] we should think of a different word to
[53:53] call this besides the message
[53:55] because it carries so many
[54:00] to stigma it bothers me
[54:04] i don't tell people you know i'm in the
[54:07] message i mean
[54:08] not that i ever did but i'm a christian
[54:15] if you you okay brother brown said the
[54:17] message will never denominate but did
[54:19] you know
[54:19] you can live the message as a
[54:22] denomination
[54:24] you can express the message as a
[54:26] denomination
[54:27] do you think that's an expression of
[54:28] eternity
[54:31] do you think god is going to be in that
[54:34] guess what you can see fulfillments
[54:38] of what you would say is god
[54:41] because the rain falls on the just and
[54:44] the unjust
[54:45] you can see women denominational women
[54:49] in
[54:49] short hair and makeup and pants and
[54:51] earrings
[54:52] dancing underneath the anointing of the
[54:54] holy spirit
[54:57] yes it's the holy spirit but
[55:00] the bible says the rain falls on the
[55:02] just and the unjust so it has
[55:04] it does not mean that inside there is
[55:07] christ
[55:12] i don't know why this keeps coming up
[55:14] god forgive me i'm not preaching against
[55:15] any man but there
[55:16] is no life in tape only because it is
[55:20] hybrid they say oh how how dare you
[55:24] speak tape only across guess what in the
[55:27] day and age that we live in
[55:30] we're going to have to just call it out
[55:34] you say oh you're just saying that
[55:35] because you're in front of friends no
[55:39] no given the opportunity
[55:42] being led of the holy spirit yes you
[55:45] believe god
[55:45] god leads your conversations
[55:48] conversation with somebody if the holy
[55:50] spirit isn't pushing you you just say
[55:52] okay that's nice have a nice day
[55:55] you don't push it because guess what you
[55:58] are no match for their intellectualism
[56:02] because the true revelation of christ is
[56:04] of the heart
[56:06] not of the mind you can have somebody
[56:08] who
[56:09] who doesn't know two plus two who can't
[56:11] figure out
[56:13] complex things or or can't do anything
[56:15] like that
[56:16] can't can't even explain to you the
[56:18] serpent seed
[56:19] and they can be so full of christ you
[56:21] wouldn't hardly believe it
[56:24] because it's not about what you know in
[56:26] your head
[56:27] it's about what you know in your heart a
[56:29] spoken word
[56:31] in your life is an expression of
[56:34] eternity
[56:36] the re because a man came up with man
[56:39] came up with the idea to play the tape
[56:42] for church and push out the five-fold
[56:45] ministry that was
[56:46] man's idea can you find me a place
[56:49] in the bible oh i can find you a quote
[56:53] okay take that quote through the entire
[56:56] message
[56:57] and then through the bible oh
[57:00] we don't need the bible anymore what
[57:04] wow okay well we can get in the weeds
[57:05] and i'm preaching to the choir
[57:07] praise the lord it stops the moving
[57:10] on of the word of god and that's
[57:13] that's what i was trying to to stick my
[57:16] what's on my heart tonight
[57:18] is that is that an idea
[57:22] not coming from eternity a revelation
[57:25] not of god will come to an
[57:29] end but a revelation expressed a spoken
[57:33] word expressed from eternity
[57:37] will continue to move with the word of
[57:39] god
[57:45] you can't sit in a church just listening
[57:47] to a tape and move on with god
[57:49] it won't happen praise the lord
[57:52] bill abraham says here in this quote he
[57:54] says now remember
[57:56] every spoken word of god is the original
[57:59] seed
[58:01] really this is the prophet
[58:07] speaking he says
[58:10] every spoken word of god is the original
[58:14] seed
[58:20] now i'm gonna blunder here
[58:32] okay well i can't find it i fail
[58:35] praise the lord but he won't he'll fill
[58:37] in the gaps for me
[58:39] every spoken word of god is the original
[58:42] seed
[58:43] there's given forth teachers apostles
[58:46] and prophets
[58:47] the fivefold ministry that's in the
[58:50] bible
[58:51] ephesians oh that's because i'm in
[58:53] corinthians
[58:54] ha ha ephesians
[58:58] see told you he'd fill in the gaps
[59:01] he's faithful
[59:08] praise lord
[59:14] and he gave some ephesians 4 11 he gave
[59:16] some apostles and some prophets and some
[59:18] evangelists and some pastors and
[59:20] teachers
[59:20] for the perfecting of the saints for the
[59:22] work of the ministry for the edifying of
[59:24] the body of christ
[59:28] every spoken word of god is the original
[59:30] seed look it lines up
[59:32] with both right god planted everything
[59:36] in the earth by
[59:37] his word and as long as you stay with
[59:41] the original seed it will breed itself
[59:43] right back
[59:44] and reproduce itself again hybrid it it
[59:47] dies
[59:48] see it's all the unspoken in that quote
[59:52] it's between the lines he says every
[59:54] spoken word of god is the original seed
[59:56] what is your life
[59:59] the spoken word of god everything in the
[1:00:02] earth
[1:00:02] by his word god planted
[1:00:06] the message of the hour has been planted
[1:00:10] as long as you stay with the original
[1:00:11] seed it will beat itself right back
[1:00:13] what is the original seed it is the the
[1:00:15] word of god the bible
[1:00:17] the message of the hour both together
[1:00:19] producing within you
[1:00:22] life an expression of eternity so a
[1:00:26] hybrid seed is death
[1:00:32] death not maybe suddenly
[1:00:36] maybe slow
[1:00:40] a hybrid seed and idea like that is
[1:00:42] serpent seed
[1:00:48] an idea of man is serpency
[1:00:51] it's finite
[1:00:56] nothing spoken of god ends
[1:01:00] nothing spoken of god ends the spoken
[1:01:03] word in your life
[1:01:05] will not end your flesh guess what what
[1:01:09] is your flesh your flesh is an idea of
[1:01:11] man
[1:01:13] they say oh but god created all man yes
[1:01:15] he did but your flesh
[1:01:18] was in an idea of man in the garden of
[1:01:20] eden
[1:01:21] the serpent said oh but did he really
[1:01:24] mean it
[1:01:25] what happened took one word replaced one
[1:01:29] word
[1:01:30] brought death now there's a separation
[1:01:34] between
[1:01:35] your flesh and god
[1:01:38] because it's the inside of you that
[1:01:40] keeps the flesh on the outside
[1:01:42] subject to the word of god without that
[1:01:45] you would not be able
[1:01:47] to control the lusts of the flesh
[1:01:50] but it is christ in you but what
[1:01:52] happened why do you have to deal with
[1:01:54] that
[1:01:54] because of a hybrid idea see what is
[1:01:58] hybrid hybrid is
[1:01:59] partial truth see the devil
[1:02:02] used through the serpent he used the
[1:02:04] bible if you will the word of god
[1:02:07] to bring up his idea for eve to partake
[1:02:11] of the fruit
[1:02:13] he didn't go out somewhere into some
[1:02:15] book in some denomination and bring up
[1:02:17] an idea
[1:02:20] no he pulled the idea from the word
[1:02:23] and eve fornicated
[1:02:26] what do you do when you accept man's
[1:02:29] idea
[1:02:31] it's fornication the the word of the
[1:02:35] the brother man says god looks upon
[1:02:37] denominations as a man making love to a
[1:02:39] dead court
[1:02:40] to a corpse you think that's just for
[1:02:43] denomination
[1:02:46] that's for in this message you see
[1:02:48] someone
[1:02:49] playing with an idea that is from man
[1:02:52] who's feeding on that who's entertaining
[1:02:54] that who's preaching that
[1:02:56] who's caught up in that it's no
[1:02:58] different than the
[1:02:59] the denominations a man making love with
[1:03:01] a corpse you know how gross that is
[1:03:04] i don't need to go into details
[1:03:07] what is it it's finite
[1:03:11] it's lack of revelation
[1:03:17] this thing it's a dead end
[1:03:21] a spoken word is a thought expressed
[1:03:26] so someone begins to to tell you we had
[1:03:29] a
[1:03:30] pastor and i won't use his name but you
[1:03:33] most of you know who he is
[1:03:35] and he begins to say he he sits down
[1:03:37] with another pastor in the message and
[1:03:38] then
[1:03:39] and there they they argue for for an
[1:03:41] hour or more
[1:03:42] because this one man's decided he's
[1:03:44] going to leave the message
[1:03:47] because none of that do you think that
[1:03:49] happened in a week
[1:03:52] well he confessed two years
[1:03:56] two years all because
[1:03:59] someone planted a seed
[1:04:03] back who knows when and that sea took a
[1:04:06] hold
[1:04:06] you say whoa whoa then he doesn't have
[1:04:08] the gold holy ghost well we don't know
[1:04:11] what he has or what he doesn't have but
[1:04:13] christ
[1:04:14] doesn't speak against christ christ
[1:04:17] doesn't deny
[1:04:18] christ and a wound sealed by the holy
[1:04:20] spirit with the seed of god
[1:04:23] can accept no other idea no other seed
[1:04:27] and that right there is a perfect
[1:04:29] expression of eternity
[1:04:33] before the foundation of the world god
[1:04:36] had
[1:04:36] a message in his mind
[1:04:40] and we listen to it on tape and we
[1:04:43] preach it over the pulpit in church
[1:04:46] whether i read it from the bible
[1:04:50] or i read it from the table
[1:04:55] that was god's desire
[1:04:58] we talk about how oh each one of us it
[1:05:01] was in the mind of god before the
[1:05:03] foundation of the world
[1:05:04] but guess what even this word was in the
[1:05:07] mind of god before the foundation of the
[1:05:08] world
[1:05:09] and when he expressed that spoken word
[1:05:12] it
[1:05:12] can't ever fail
[1:05:15] you are god's thought expressed
[1:05:20] next time you're having a bad day and
[1:05:21] the devil's telling you you ain't worth
[1:05:23] nothing
[1:05:23] you tell them i'm sorry i'm a thought of
[1:05:25] god expressed
[1:05:27] because you are and there's no dead end
[1:05:29] when you're a thought of god expressed
[1:05:31] why because you are the spoken word
[1:05:35] because you are the original seed
[1:05:39] you see you couldn't receive a seed
[1:05:42] from that's why it says god has no
[1:05:44] grandchildren you have to receive the
[1:05:47] original seed
[1:05:49] you have to receive the seed that comes
[1:05:51] from the spoken word of god
[1:05:54] that's why when a man tells you
[1:05:56] something about the bible
[1:05:58] that doesn't line up with the word
[1:06:00] there'll be nothing in it
[1:06:02] for you no life in it for you just death
[1:06:06] christ spoke you into existence
[1:06:10] before i formed thee in the belly i knew
[1:06:12] thee and before thou came us forth
[1:06:14] out of the womb i sanctified thee
[1:06:19] and i ordained thee a prophet unto the
[1:06:21] nations
[1:06:24] praise the lord there's one word
[1:06:29] and we've said it many times is the seed
[1:06:33] right you are
[1:06:38] part of christ amen god
[1:06:41] is eternal
[1:06:44] which would mean god's thoughts are
[1:06:46] eternal
[1:06:48] you are part of god's thoughts
[1:06:51] so you are eternal not your flesh
[1:06:55] because your flesh is in the thought of
[1:06:56] god
[1:06:58] your spirit your soul is
[1:07:01] eternal if you've accepted christ and
[1:07:04] you're sealed by christ
[1:07:06] you cannot die you cannot come to a dead
[1:07:10] end because you
[1:07:11] are an expression of eternity
[1:07:16] christ's spoken word is the original
[1:07:19] seed amen that message
[1:07:20] is more than a title
[1:07:25] i jumped ahead of my slides praise the
[1:07:27] lord
[1:07:29] so what is the message
[1:07:34] is it just words on a page
[1:07:37] is it a man's idea
[1:07:40] acts 5 35 to 39 says and said unto them
[1:07:44] gamaliel speaking he says you men of
[1:07:47] israel take heed to yourselves what she
[1:07:49] intended to do as touching these men for
[1:07:51] before these days rose up theodos
[1:07:53] boasting himself to be somebody to whom
[1:07:55] a number of men about 400
[1:07:57] joined themselves who was slain and all
[1:07:59] as many as obeyed him were scattered and
[1:08:01] brought to naught
[1:08:02] after this man rose up judas of galilee
[1:08:05] in the days of the taxing and drew away
[1:08:06] much people after him he also perished
[1:08:09] and all
[1:08:10] even as many as obeyed him were
[1:08:11] dispersed and now i say unto you refrain
[1:08:14] from these men and let them alone for if
[1:08:16] this council or this
[1:08:17] work be of men it will come to not
[1:08:20] but if it be of god you cannot overthrow
[1:08:24] it lest happily ye be found even to
[1:08:27] fight against
[1:08:28] god
[1:08:32] praise the lord if you add one word
[1:08:36] it's hybrid remove one word
[1:08:41] it's hybrid because
[1:08:45] god's word is eternal it has to be
[1:08:48] complete there is nothing missing
[1:08:52] from god's word there is nothing that
[1:08:55] needs to be
[1:08:56] removed there's not too much of god's
[1:08:59] word
[1:09:00] because god is eternal everything about
[1:09:03] him is eternal so he knows the end from
[1:09:05] the beginning because
[1:09:07] from his viewpoint there is no end or
[1:09:09] beginning
[1:09:10] so he has to in order to be eternal in
[1:09:12] order to be god he has to know
[1:09:14] everything
[1:09:18] so his word then has to be
[1:09:21] fit and complete to handle
[1:09:25] everything if you have a question where
[1:09:28] are you going to find the answer
[1:09:30] in the word you say but i haven't and
[1:09:32] i've been looking and i've been looking
[1:09:34] and i've been looking
[1:09:37] god is faithful and he will answer that
[1:09:39] question even if it's on the other side
[1:09:44] we are not called to find the answer to
[1:09:46] every question you see what happened
[1:09:47] with that
[1:09:48] pastor he set out to answer questions
[1:09:51] that didn't need an answer
[1:09:54] and doubt when doubt began to breed you
[1:09:57] know what breeds doubt
[1:10:00] pushing to find the answer through your
[1:10:03] own
[1:10:03] strength pushing to find an
[1:10:07] answer because guess what we as humans
[1:10:09] we got to know
[1:10:10] right why do you think everyone googles
[1:10:12] everything you gotta know
[1:10:14] what happened to the days before google
[1:10:15] right we just sat around for an hour
[1:10:16] discussing whether or not this was true
[1:10:18] not this but something was true you know
[1:10:20] yeah so i heard the other day you know
[1:10:22] a giraffe can't lick its elbow or it's
[1:10:24] it's kneecap
[1:10:25] and that was really random okay you
[1:10:26] can't lick your elbow right so what does
[1:10:28] everyone do
[1:10:28] everyone tries it oh yeah i don't think
[1:10:30] that works yeah maybe that doesn't work
[1:10:32] maybe there's some people that can do it
[1:10:33] nowadays like
[1:10:34] you can't lick your elbow nope i can't
[1:10:40] watch some cat on youtube try to do it
[1:10:44] that's the age that we live in the age
[1:10:45] of information instantly
[1:10:48] why do you think what do you think
[1:10:50] that's the case
[1:10:52] because the devil knows that's not how
[1:10:54] god works
[1:10:57] how long did it take abraham to get the
[1:10:59] promised son
[1:11:00] who which was what the spoken word right
[1:11:04] 25 plus years when he was called of god
[1:11:08] he was already
[1:11:10] 70. any all been alive for 70 years yet
[1:11:16] no so you you you wouldn't even reach
[1:11:19] the point for god to call you if you was
[1:11:21] abraham
[1:11:24] yet oh it's been a week
[1:11:28] and my package hasn't arrived
[1:11:35] me and we were yeah we were just talking
[1:11:37] about that the other day me and isaac
[1:11:39] you know you back in the day it was like
[1:11:40] three weeks right okay that's fine yeah
[1:11:42] wow it's only three weeks now it's like
[1:11:45] it's been two days
[1:11:46] where's my package or you go you gotta
[1:11:50] buy something that's not on amazon it's
[1:11:51] some other private website
[1:11:53] and it's like you know five to seven
[1:11:55] business days
[1:11:56] like oh my goodness is it on amazon
[1:12:00] i need it tomorrow right and then you
[1:12:02] see the list it's like
[1:12:04] expedite you know it's like going to a
[1:12:06] car wash it just progresses and gets
[1:12:08] more expensive but just by small
[1:12:09] increments and you're
[1:12:10] you're like it's seven days right and
[1:12:12] you're like if i can have that tomorrow
[1:12:14] for an extra thirty dollars because you
[1:12:18] can't wait
[1:12:19] to get it and that's what we have today
[1:12:22] is a bunch of impatient people because
[1:12:24] the society breeds that
[1:12:26] in them as
[1:12:29] a software engineer we also dabble in
[1:12:33] designing
[1:12:34] i mean because it's part of our job
[1:12:35] designing websites that hold your
[1:12:37] attention
[1:12:39] the average the the the time span that
[1:12:42] we have
[1:12:42] on a page and i'm i'm i'm pulling from
[1:12:45] memory here so i may be wrong
[1:12:46] to catch your attention is like 0.7
[1:12:49] seconds
[1:12:50] before you swipe and move on
[1:12:54] fast everything is fast you can never
[1:12:58] disconnect
[1:13:01] what is that it's distraction con i'm
[1:13:03] going somewhere that's constant
[1:13:04] bombardment caught
[1:13:06] constant distractions
[1:13:09] from the opposite of truth not all of
[1:13:12] it's bad
[1:13:13] it's just not life right and so you have
[1:13:17] these distractions and so then when it
[1:13:18] comes time and god's trying to move
[1:13:20] people are sitting there like why is a
[1:13:22] song leader leading songs longer than 30
[1:13:23] minutes
[1:13:25] or why isn't he leading only 15 minutes
[1:13:28] why is the preacher preaching so long
[1:13:30] why is the preacher preaching so
[1:13:31] short shut up and sit down
[1:13:35] god's trying to tell you something
[1:13:40] we get so impatient we need to have it
[1:13:42] now
[1:13:45] guess what that's what abraham wanted
[1:13:48] and what did him
[1:13:49] wanting to have him and sarah wanted to
[1:13:50] have it now bring
[1:13:54] ishmael
[1:13:58] even that picture just makes you think
[1:13:59] of war and persecution
[1:14:04] oops i went too far
[1:14:08] so abraham and sarah added one word
[1:14:11] with hagar who
[1:14:15] was an egyptian right which what is
[1:14:18] egypt the type of the world so
[1:14:19] it was a it was coming from man abraham
[1:14:23] and sarah said oh i know how we can make
[1:14:24] the word come to pass
[1:14:27] put together a horse and a donkey
[1:14:33] sarah's like i need this promised son
[1:14:35] it's been too long there's absolutely no
[1:14:37] way whatsoever that god's work can come
[1:14:39] to pass
[1:14:40] whoa that's not what she said but that's
[1:14:43] what she believed
[1:14:45] god's word when you go when you go ahead
[1:14:48] and you don't wait for the russell and
[1:14:50] the mulberry trees
[1:14:52] you're saying god's not good enough to
[1:14:54] keep his word
[1:14:56] when you say when you try to step
[1:14:58] forward and hurry up and get done in
[1:14:59] your time you're saying
[1:15:00] god's word isn't good enough
[1:15:04] but none of you would say that to my
[1:15:06] face
[1:15:08] oh sorry no god's worth isn't good
[1:15:10] enough but your actions are an
[1:15:11] expression
[1:15:12] of your heart
[1:15:18] your words are an expression of your
[1:15:20] thoughts your thoughts come from your
[1:15:21] heart
[1:15:23] so because abraham and sarah jumped the
[1:15:25] gun and they went
[1:15:26] excuse me they went ahead and did their
[1:15:29] own thing and
[1:15:29] brought forth ishmael who continues to
[1:15:34] bring death but then
[1:15:38] three men walked out of the desert one
[1:15:40] day as abraham was sitting in the door
[1:15:42] of the tent in the heat of the day
[1:15:45] and here steps out
[1:15:49] three men two angels and one was
[1:15:52] elohim abraham recognizing him
[1:15:55] runs and says you know prepare a feast
[1:15:57] he gets a he gets a
[1:15:58] a lamb i think or something or calf or
[1:16:02] it prepares a feast for them please sit
[1:16:04] down and eat my lord
[1:16:06] right he recognizes the difference
[1:16:08] between the two angels and
[1:16:11] god elohim and elohim begins to speak to
[1:16:14] him
[1:16:16] elohim begins to express his thoughts
[1:16:20] to him because a word is a thought
[1:16:22] expressed
[1:16:23] and he says abraham
[1:16:26] i will visit you according to the time
[1:16:28] of life
[1:16:30] now sarah being weak in the flesh inside
[1:16:32] the tent
[1:16:33] yet covered by abraham
[1:16:37] laughs in her heart says how can that be
[1:16:40] i me being old can i have pleasure with
[1:16:42] my lord after all these years and then
[1:16:44] the elohim with his back to the tent
[1:16:45] says why did sarah laugh
[1:16:48] sarah comes out says she denies it he
[1:16:51] says
[1:16:52] i will visit you according to the time
[1:16:53] of life he spoke the word
[1:16:56] god had been saying to abraham for years
[1:17:00] you will have a promise you will have a
[1:17:02] son
[1:17:04] you he he says your your your
[1:17:07] seed will be as the sand on the sea
[1:17:11] and as the stars in the sky i will make
[1:17:13] a nation out of you abraham
[1:17:17] but then god came down in flesh
[1:17:20] i'm not making this stuff up this is
[1:17:22] right in your bible god came down in
[1:17:24] flesh and spoke the word
[1:17:29] christ in the midst
[1:17:32] god came down with a message for us
[1:17:35] through the mouthpiece of a man
[1:17:39] brought to us the message now the
[1:17:41] message has continued because it's the
[1:17:43] spoken word of god
[1:17:46] because it came from god the thoughts
[1:17:49] the words expressed it was an expression
[1:17:51] of eternity brought forth the spoken
[1:17:53] word now that spoken word
[1:17:55] is in us guess what we can't
[1:17:58] just listen to the tapes because the
[1:18:01] spirit of god the spoken word is
[1:18:03] moving forward sitting down and
[1:18:06] listening to
[1:18:06] i'm talking about in church listening to
[1:18:07] a tape in church
[1:18:09] isn't moving forward with christ
[1:18:14] that keeps going over dead i'm just
[1:18:16] hoping you're all tired and inside
[1:18:17] you're going amen amen amen
[1:18:20] and it will bring forth death
[1:18:23] but the spoken word of god i will visit
[1:18:26] you according to the time of life
[1:18:28] brought forth the promised son
[1:18:31] you see there's one thing about the
[1:18:33] spoken word of god
[1:18:34] and it is truth and the bible says the
[1:18:38] truth shall set you free
[1:18:41] and there's one other promise and i i'm
[1:18:43] not taking too much time tonight
[1:18:45] oops i don't have my watch over here
[1:18:51] praise the lord there's one more promise
[1:18:54] in the word of god
[1:18:55] that says he who began this work in you
[1:18:58] will finish it will
[1:19:02] not maybe not hopefully
[1:19:05] will finish it they say how how can that
[1:19:08] how can that happen how can
[1:19:10] how can this come to oh
[1:19:13] how can how can god finish this work
[1:19:16] because he spoke it you see that's why
[1:19:19] it's so important that you feed on the
[1:19:21] word of god because that
[1:19:22] word of god is pulling you along
[1:19:26] it's pulling you along you have a
[1:19:28] destination
[1:19:30] you have a you have a place to go
[1:19:33] you have a ticket you have to get to the
[1:19:35] railway station and you have to get on
[1:19:37] the train
[1:19:40] and that is what's going to bring you
[1:19:44] to your husband what is that ticket
[1:19:47] it's the seed say oh you're pregnant yes
[1:19:50] please get on the train
[1:19:52] that's what it is god looking to
[1:19:54] identify himself
[1:19:56] in you because your life
[1:20:00] who you are is an expression of
[1:20:03] eternity and the reason that
[1:20:06] i can say that is because it's god's
[1:20:08] spoken word
[1:20:10] i feel like we're going back and forth
[1:20:12] that's the message that's the word of
[1:20:14] god right
[1:20:14] big eight eternity it never ends it
[1:20:17] keeps on going
[1:20:18] keeps on going you can read the same
[1:20:20] scripture today
[1:20:22] that you read yesterday and it means
[1:20:24] more
[1:20:26] or something different now it always
[1:20:28] lines up with the word
[1:20:30] it continues to to to expound you need
[1:20:34] genesis now next time you read genesis
[1:20:35] you know
[1:20:36] the earth was without form and void

[1:20:38] earth
[1:20:39] i was without form and void before god
[1:20:41] came along and
[1:20:43] shined his light upon you but see that
[1:20:46] was
[1:20:46] that was your destination with eternity
[1:20:50] is that god will come along and express
[1:20:52] himself in you
[1:20:54] so you could overcome this world
[1:20:57] because you cannot do that on your own
[1:21:01] god always keeps his promises and one of
[1:21:05] his promises
[1:21:06] is that you will overcome the position's
[1:21:08] going to come tonight

[1:21:46] 45 minutes

[1:21:48] much time

[1:21:57] god can change a life
[1:22:00] because it's not i was in the back i was
[1:22:01] praying but i no amount of
[1:22:03] words i could put on a page can change
