[23:59] completely and forever one
[24:04] by Christ emerging from the gray
[24:09] I will wait for you I will wait for you

[30:23] them the talent that God has placed here
[30:26] in this assembly and we're seeing the
[30:29] talent coming to life and there's some
[30:31] of you I would dare to say are still
[30:34] hiding your talents and you don't want
[30:38] to do that you want to just dig your
[30:40] talents out get them out in the open let
[30:42] God bless your talents amen
[30:45] so I have something I want to speak on
[30:47] for just a moment here that
[30:50] um just uh something that has been long
[30:54] overdue but sometimes circumstances
[30:56] bring us into positions that for reasons
[31:00] we won't bother to explain this morning
[31:02] you kind of pull back from something but
[31:05] it's been a long time since we've had a
[31:07] vote in the church over the offices
[31:09] and while we are not here to have a vote
[31:13] to say
[31:14] um we're putting this person against
[31:16] this person which one do you want but
[31:19] we're looking to a vote of confidence
[31:22] and uh what we desire is is that as an
[31:26] assembly that your voice would be heard
[31:29] to express
[31:31] how you feel
[31:33] is the church the officers of the church
[31:35] leading in the right direction or they
[31:38] helping you in your spiritual walk so I
[31:41] would desire for you to pray we haven't
[31:43] set a vote date but it will be in the
[31:46] next few weeks uh and um if you're not
[31:49] here when the vote takes place you will
[31:52] still have your opportunity to vote
[31:54] regardless if if life draws you
[31:58] somewhere else at the time
[32:00] and to be able to speak that and along
[32:04] that line I've been speaking with our
[32:06] brother Sergey for quite a while uh on
[32:09] on different things I uh not lifting up
[32:12] brother Sergey but I have found that I I
[32:15] appreciate his perspective that he
[32:18] brings he he has you know one thing let
[32:22] me just interject this one thing I
[32:23] appreciate about the men of this church
[32:26] is they'll speak their mind
[32:28] the church our officers are Yes Men
[32:31] they're not saying yes to men they're
[32:34] saying yes to God
[32:36] and so as they say yes to what they feel
[32:39] the leadership is in their life and what
[32:41] God is dealing with them they're not
[32:43] afraid to speak their mind and I
[32:45] appreciate that you know sometimes it's
[32:48] just a human nature we would like
[32:49] everyone to agree with us
[32:51] but you realize what kind of a
[32:54] catastrophe we would have if everyone
[32:57] just agreed with us let's all run like
[33:00] lemmings
[33:03] oh yes let's do it brother where's the
[33:06] nearest cliff
[33:07] no we want men to stop and say brother
[33:11] think about it
[33:13] and so uh
[33:16] I have asked brother Sergey quite some
[33:18] time back and just kind of been dragging
[33:21] my feet just waiting and just Desiring
[33:24] for the Lord to put everything in the
[33:26] right order we've asked brother Sergey
[33:28] to join the trustee board
[33:30] and um the current trustees are all in
[33:35] favor of that and welcome brother Sergey
[33:37] on that so when it comes to the vote
[33:40] there will be for like the office of
[33:44] Pastor
[33:45] it will be a vote of confidence it will
[33:48] be
[33:49] yes we have confidence or no we don't
[33:52] and then as the offices are that's how
[33:55] that vote will also go for these
[33:57] brothers I have confidence or I don't
[34:01] and that's what the vote will be brother
[34:03] Sergey will be the only one that you are
[34:06] literally voting in
[34:09] because even if the vote of confidence
[34:11] said brother Paul we have no confidence
[34:13] as you as a pastor that is not voting me
[34:15] out of office we as a church would then
[34:18] have to resolve
[34:19] the circumstance of why
[34:22] and literally we put it this way that
[34:25] any man who wouldn't have the confidence
[34:27] of the people
[34:28] uh you don't really want them in that
[34:31] office
[34:32] because if one is preaching as it would
[34:35] be a minister and you not sure you can
[34:38] trust their leadership
[34:40] then you're not going to listen anyway
[34:43] you're not going to follow that so what
[34:46] we want is the mind of God we want the
[34:48] will of God so we'll be having this vote
[34:52] here in in probably a couple or three
[34:55] weeks I don't think we want to do it
[34:56] when brother George is here
[34:58] um you know brother George will tell you
[35:00] throw the bomb out
[35:02] and um I shouldn't have put brother
[35:04] George in the message I'm sorry
[35:06] so anyway
[35:08] uh brother George will be here
[35:10] we'll have a regular Services coming
[35:13] Saturday at seven o'clock and Sunday at
[35:16] 10 30 with a fellowship to follow I uh
[35:19] brother George has been very busy I have
[35:21] been very busy we have connected but
[35:23] only briefly and so there's a
[35:26] possibility that we will have an
[35:28] informal Friday service when I say
[35:31] informal it will be something that you
[35:34] as the church
[35:36] can have opportunity to speak up
[35:38] interact
[35:40] Etc probably take place in the basement
[35:42] so keep that in mind and please pray for
[35:45] that and once again we're happy to see
[35:47] each and every one of you here today and
[35:50] um so let's just uh turn in our Bibles
[35:53] will stand and turning our Bibles to the
[35:55] Book of Numbers
[35:58] the first chapter
[36:00] and
[36:01] um I don't want this to be confusing
[36:03] we're actually turning to numbers 1 16
[36:05] through 19 but I want to make a quick
[36:08] reference here so you'll understand
[36:09] where this scripture is going in numbers
[36:12] 1 verses 1 through 3 God is speaking to
[36:16] Moses in the wilderness of Sinai in the
[36:19] Tabernacle of the congregation on the
[36:21] first day of the second month in the
[36:23] second year after they come out of the
[36:24] land of Egypt so some time has went by
[36:27] and God is now wanting to set certain
[36:30] things in order so he's speaking to
[36:32] Moses and giving them a giving him a
[36:36] direction for the people and he's
[36:38] telling them to take a Psalm or or add
[36:40] up or look at the congregation of the
[36:43] children of Israel and look at their
[36:45] families and look at the house of their
[36:47] fathers and the number of their names
[36:50] every young man and so it's there that
[36:53] we see that 20 years old and upward to
[36:56] go forth and he's calling them God is
[36:59] actually preparing Israel for Warfare
[37:03] and so I it struck my heart we have we
[37:06] have songs today that just went right
[37:08] along that line amen I was called to the
[37:10] army of God
[37:12] amen I wasn't called to be a bystander
[37:15] or just an observer and I don't want to
[37:18] read about it as a historical event like
[37:20] as it would be is the prophet of God
[37:22] says if there was a book of Acts written
[37:24] in this day my brother and sister I want
[37:27] to be written in that book amen amen I
[37:30] don't want it to be a history event of
[37:32] these brothers here this sister there
[37:34] this family there they pressed into the
[37:36] battle and they served God and my name's
[37:38] completely absent no sir I want to be
[37:41] found if there was another book of Acts
[37:43] written I want my name to be found as a
[37:47] person as a son or daughter of God that
[37:50] was called to stand up and fight for the
[37:52] gospel amen it's one thing to be an
[37:54] observer amen it's another thing to be a
[37:57] participant Hallelujah and let me just
[38:00] put it to the Natural
[38:01] I think most of us I won't try and make
[38:04] it inclusive most of us as kids if there
[38:07] was an impromptu ball game volleyball
[38:09] game something
[38:12] you didn't want to go there as they're
[38:14] picking teams
[38:15] and say I'll just stand here but really
[38:17] I come to be an observer
[38:19] as kids now when you get to be 60. you
[38:23] get to be 60 of being an observer is
[38:25] really cool I mean it's just like watch
[38:27] these young people jump and run and
[38:29] sweat and sprain their ankles and all of
[38:31] these things I can just watch that
[38:33] happen all day long but when you're
[38:35] young you want to be a part of what's
[38:37] Happening amen and so we were not called
[38:40] to be Observers
[38:42] we're called to be Warriors
[38:44] amen let's go to verse 16.
[38:49] these were the renowned of the
[38:51] congregation princes of the tribes of
[38:54] their fathers heads of thousands in
[38:57] Israel
[38:58] and Moses and Aaron took these men which
[39:01] are expressed by their names
[39:04] and they assembled all the congregation
[39:06] together on the first day of the second
[39:08] month and declared their pedigrees after
[39:11] their families by the house of their
[39:13] fathers according to the number of the
[39:17] names from 20 years old and upward by
[39:20] their polls
[39:21] as the Lord commanded Moses so he
[39:24] numbered them in the wilderness of Sinai
[39:28] father we just ask you to come and bless
[39:31] this time together Lord as we just
[39:33] desire from a heart to express this to
[39:35] your Saints as an encouragement today
[39:38] Lord of what you really called us to do
[39:40] father
[39:41] not to just sit in the edge of the
[39:43] desert of Sinai of our day
[39:47] and just say whatever will be will be
[39:50] Lord we know that came from the devil
[39:52] when he tried to get the people to not
[39:55] recognize what their true calling was or
[39:59] is that they would just set back and
[40:01] whatever would unfold that they would be
[40:03] Anointed with a spirit of defeatism to
[40:06] just accept what happens around them but
[40:09] father you did not call us in this hour
[40:12] Lord to just accept Satan's verdict but
[40:16] you called us in this hour to see who we
[40:19] are to stand up and have our names
[40:22] announced and recorded and father to be
[40:26] numbered as Sons and Daughters of God we
[40:29] ask for your leadership today in the
[40:31] name of Jesus Christ amen you may be
[40:34] seated
[40:43] as we would look here in numbers I want
[40:46] to draw this forward into the day that
[40:49] we live in and draw thought from this
[40:53] as we'll see that brother Branham given
[40:55] the vision of the Bride going marching
[40:58] up into Glory now my brother and sister
[41:00] in that Vision we can look at that some
[41:03] people would say you're making quite an
[41:05] assumption well if I am then God help me
[41:09] that my assumption would be correct but
[41:11] as we look at this my brother and sister
[41:13] this was an honored analogy this was not
[41:15] a prophet seeing a people that just
[41:18] represented something but I personally
[41:21] many years ago it struck my heart so
[41:23] strongly that I was in that number amen
[41:26] when the prophet of God saw that vision
[41:28] of the Bride going into Glory I was in
[41:31] that number he saw a literal bride being
[41:35] called of God into the presence of God
[41:37] and my brother and sister I was
[41:39] represented there you were represented
[41:41] there and so it's there in that we
[41:44] realize that we can look at many things
[41:47] in the Bible would be figurative we can
[41:49] look at many things in the Bible that
[41:51] would be giving us a type and a shadow
[41:53] but I believe there are some things in
[41:56] the lives of Believers that we should
[41:57] stop and say I believe that was literal
[42:00] and it was for me amen because we're
[42:03] looking in a day as it is that Israel
[42:06] having come out of Egypt my brother and
[42:08] sister there was these struggles that
[42:10] they had right off the bat my brother
[42:13] and sister they come to the Red Sea and
[42:16] you know the greatest challenge that
[42:18] Israel had right at that moment let's
[42:20] forget the whole big picture sometimes
[42:22] when we come face to face the challenge
[42:25] we're facing right at that moment is the
[42:29] overwhelming a spirit of either Victory
[42:32] or defeat question mark a lack of
[42:35] confidence great confidence and we have
[42:38] to face that challenge of the moment we
[42:41] can stand there at that moment and say
[42:42] well I'm the bride of Christ but if you
[42:44] can't speak the word and act upon it
[42:47] then it's irrelevant to you what you
[42:49] have heard in the past what has been
[42:51] spoke to you it needs to take route
[42:53] where we could be and come down to the
[42:55] Red Sea we've all heard it preach but if
[42:58] Israel had come at that time and if that
[43:01] Spirit of doubt and fear had not been
[43:03] upon them the priests would have marched
[43:05] right out into the Red Sea they would
[43:07] have said if this is where God has
[43:09] brought us this is where I want to be
[43:12] amen not with the spirit of if God's
[43:14] going to force me but I want to be where
[43:17] God wants me to be I want to go where
[43:20] God has called me to be and sometimes
[43:23] we'll see and I don't want our guests
[43:25] today to feel like I'm speaking at you
[43:28] but I didn't know you were going to be
[43:29] here so just please Buckle that seat
[43:32] belt and bear with us my brother and
[43:34] sister if you have the attitude that God
[43:37] is forcing me to serve him you are in
[43:40] the wrong attitude you're in the wrong
[43:43] atmosphere God is trying to woo us and
[43:47] direct us to serve him but there's only
[43:49] two spirits
[43:51] amen so if God's not wooing us who is
[43:55] and so as we look at this and realize as
[43:58] it come down as the prophet sees a bride
[44:01] marching into Glory each one was
[44:04] identified now we'll understand here if
[44:07] you'll bear with me each one of those
[44:09] was identified but a prophet couldn't
[44:11] have said I see brother so and so sister
[44:13] so and so people he never met or people
[44:15] that never came to the Lord until he was
[44:18] gone from the scene God did not anoint
[44:20] him to be able to just run a roll call
[44:22] at that time not his job amen not what
[44:24] God called him to do was not to run a
[44:27] roll call amen so it's there each one's
[44:30] identified because this is not a random
[44:33] group it's not too hard to study the
[44:35] scriptures and realize that this bride
[44:37] of this last day is not a random group
[44:40] amen don't you love it when they have a
[44:42] pole you'll see that is President Biden
[44:45] is he doing a good job as president and
[44:48] it's a random poll but how random
[44:52] how random my brother and sister
[44:54] amen you know I I would I won't say that
[44:58] because it'll be misunderstood but you
[45:00] look at this my brother and sister you
[45:02] see this was not a random group of
[45:06] people that is making up the Bride of
[45:09] this last day it was not a random group
[45:12] of people that walked out of Egypt
[45:17] every one of them God knew who they were
[45:19] and he had numbered them
[45:21] amen amen and so it's here each one
[45:24] identified and they come now the word
[45:27] says if you can number the grains of
[45:31] dust or you can number the Sands of the
[45:34] sea then you could number God's people
[45:37] so that's in that's in Genesis 13 16 and
[45:40] Genesis 32 12. you can look those up if
[45:43] you want to that is speaking now my
[45:46] brother and sister we know that it would
[45:47] be humanly impossible to number the
[45:51] Sands of the the sand on the seashore
[45:54] amen it would be impossible to name or
[45:57] number the particles of dust upon the
[46:00] Earth so it is impossible for mankind to
[46:04] number the Bride of Jesus Christ Now
[46:07] isn't it interesting that um different
[46:09] things I just throw this out don't make
[46:11] much of it that um you know there's some
[46:13] people they're trying to decide if the
[46:15] message of the hour has any relevance in
[46:17] the world of religion and that one man
[46:20] says well you know it's not nothing it
[46:23] doesn't count as anything there's only a
[46:25] few hundred thousand of them on the
[46:27] whole Earth
[46:30] he must be able to number the sand
[46:33] and the Dust
[46:35] because contrary to the word of God God
[46:38] says unless you can do that you cannot
[46:40] number
[46:42] so they are there just making
[46:44] assumptions and their assumptions if
[46:47] they were for the Assumption should be
[46:50] no this is a great move of God that's
[46:52] gaining momentum but they're looking at
[46:55] it now they're inconsequential our our
[46:57] denomination has 17 million people
[47:00] there's maybe a hundred thousand of
[47:03] these my brother and sister I'm telling
[47:05] you God knows who are his and he's the
[47:09] only one that numbers should matter to
[47:13] amen and it should matter to us whether
[47:16] we're counted in that number or not it
[47:19] shouldn't be well if God wants me to be
[47:21] in that number then I guess I will be in
[47:23] that number no there's something inside
[47:25] of me says Lord count me in that number
[47:29] I want to be counted in that number
[47:33] and so as it is it strikes our heart
[47:36] isn't this amazing
[47:38] reminds me of a Story Once A man was
[47:41] pulled over speeding
[47:44] and when the the patrolman comes up
[47:48] gets his information comes back to right
[47:50] to man a ticket and the man says I'll
[47:52] have you to know I'm friends with the
[47:54] governor
[47:56] the officer stands there a minute looks
[47:58] at him and says you're friends with the
[48:00] governor yes sir I'm friends with the
[48:02] governor is the governor your friend
[48:08] you see my brother and sister it's one
[48:09] thing for us to say Hey you know he's my
[48:12] savior but does he look down on us and
[48:15] say I am their savior
[48:18] amen save us from our sin Lord
[48:21] I want you to look down on us today Lord
[48:24] and say I am their savior but you see if
[48:28] we don't accept salvation then we can't
[48:31] say he's our savior
[48:39] everyone
[48:41] personally known to God
[48:44] do you realize my brother and sister are
[48:45] even the unbeliever is personally known
[48:48] to God
[48:49] this is how awesome omnipotent our God
[48:52] is to say he knows my brother and sister
[48:55] who the scripture says who is his own
[49:00] he knows who is on that that means he
[49:03] can recognize each one amen and identify
[49:07] them because he knows who they are and I
[49:12] say this positive today please no one
[49:13] think that I'm going down a negative
[49:16] route here because when I was studying
[49:19] this my heart was just full of joy to
[49:22] know that I could be counted in that
[49:24] number to be knowing with confidence
[49:26] that God knows who I am God knows who I
[49:30] what my needs are he knows my weaknesses
[49:33] he knows my strength and that makes my
[49:36] heart Rejoice because you see it's not a
[49:39] guessing game
[49:40] I can stand here you can stand here
[49:42] today with confidence and say I know who
[49:46] my redeemer is
[49:48] and if we know who Our Redeemer is with
[49:51] a relationship then he also knows who he
[49:55] hath redeemed
[49:56] but you see it's Satan's job and he's
[49:59] done quite well with it amen he's the
[50:01] God of this age amen he's been through
[50:04] the ages the god of the age look of this
[50:06] you want verification go back when it's
[50:08] there what happened Satan offered Jesus
[50:11] the kingdoms of this world he couldn't
[50:15] offer something he didn't have control
[50:17] over amen but he's sitting here today
[50:20] knowing he's fixing to lose control amen
[50:24] it's slowly being rested from his hands
[50:27] my brother and sister you realize that
[50:30] Satan is desperate now we often get a
[50:33] mental idea that the devil is this great
[50:35] big omnipotent strong guy but my brother
[50:38] and sister he is completely controlled
[50:41] by the word
[50:43] amen there's not one thing that Satan
[50:45] can do that the word has not given him
[50:48] permission to do
[50:49] and so as we look at this when we come
[50:52] and realize that God having called you
[50:54] and I he has looked at our lineage he's
[50:57] looked at our pedigree aren't you glad
[50:59] he looked at the pedigree amen he knows
[51:02] where we come from and who we are and he
[51:06] looked at that and said I'm going to
[51:07] name them by name and I'm going to count
[51:10] them by number and these are mine that I
[51:13] have called to be the Warriors of 2023.
[51:17] in 2024 or whatever God is called we're
[51:20] not just randomly here but called to be
[51:23] Warriors
[51:24] I'll tell you what I'll never have I'll
[51:27] never have oh God forgive me if I'm
[51:29] wrong here but I will never have a wall
[51:33] branded to my name I will well I did it
[51:36] one time but the blood covered that amen
[51:38] but you know I won't ever be able to
[51:41] stand and say God didn't give me
[51:43] opportunity to rise up I have my brother
[51:47] and sister and you have accepted the
[51:50] opportunity to step into the calling
[51:53] that God has in your life
[51:55] hallelujah what to be the Warriors of
[51:57] laodicea amen not observers of laodicea
[52:01] not observers of Satan's games and
[52:05] gimmicks and things that he promises he
[52:07] promises a pleasure for a season but
[52:10] then as seasons pass he says all bets
[52:14] are off
[52:15] it's an acceptable phrase
[52:18] what I promised you there doesn't apply
[52:20] today
[52:22] people start out in the pleasures of
[52:23] life and end up in alleys
[52:26] lived in penthouses you know the story
[52:29] and end up in alleys looking at the
[52:32] penthouse they used to live in
[52:34] and there's always a reason my brother
[52:36] and sister they don't just move out of
[52:38] the penthouse one day and go live in an
[52:40] alley there's always something that
[52:42] happened amen one story there of a man
[52:45] amen as it was his world started to
[52:48] unravel his wife leaves him there's
[52:50] trouble he goes broke he went from
[52:52] living a lavish lifestyle to living in
[52:55] an alley looking up at the house he used
[52:59] to live in and what happened he said it
[53:02] all started and he names the place that
[53:05] it all started what if that place had
[53:07] been placed under the blood of Jesus
[53:09] Christ and God had stared you say well
[53:11] well why did God allow it to happen my
[53:14] brother and sister free moral agency is
[53:15] still here
[53:17] I get to choose to be a warrior today or
[53:19] I can be an observer today I can choose
[53:22] to stand on the word or I can compromise
[53:24] on the word I have that choice
[53:27] now God says he never lost a one so I'll
[53:30] probably get drugged through the dirt if
[53:32] I made that kind of a bad decision until
[53:34] I come to the place that I cry out and
[53:36] say Lord I need you
[53:37] I need you Lord I need you more than I
[53:39] need anything else in this world I need
[53:41] you
[53:42] amen
[53:44] Hallelujah
[53:46] everyone personally known to God
[53:49] as the song says he knows my name
[53:52] amen I want to sing that my brother and
[53:54] sister as he knows my name as a part of
[53:58] the bride of Christ of the redeemed I
[54:00] don't want him to know my name as one
[54:02] that saw the word and walked away one
[54:04] that said I'll compromise one that said
[54:07] I don't have time I don't want to be
[54:09] known by that I want to be known as one
[54:11] that says yes Lord
[54:13] yes Lord I want Yes Men I want to be a
[54:16] yes man yes Lord whatever you want me to
[54:19] do yes Lord I trust you
[54:27] sister Sue often buys me military
[54:29] history books
[54:31] not to throw sisters who under the bus
[54:33] but that's where they appear from
[54:37] and when you look at these stories that
[54:39] these men share
[54:41] about their time of combat
[54:44] not all these stories as men unscathed
[54:48] many of these stories men come home
[54:51] wounded in spirit
[54:54] and in the flesh
[54:55] missing legs and arms and eyes
[55:00] and in one book they asked this man
[55:05] how could you go
[55:07] and fight in such Fierce places like
[55:11] Afghanistan and ramadi in Iraq how could
[55:15] you do that
[55:17] because these other men
[55:20] had my back
[55:22] and I could completely trust my life to
[55:27] them
[55:28] now my brother and sister if we could
[55:30] trust a fellow man
[55:32] oh how we should be able to trust our
[55:35] Lord Jesus Christ
[55:37] men will go
[55:43] in one story if I could just recount it
[55:45] briefly to you
[55:46] a fellow Soldier is shot down in the
[55:49] middle of a street
[55:50] and the bullets are pucking around him
[55:52] because they're still trying to finish
[55:54] him off
[55:55] and a man a fellow shoulder Runs Out
[55:59] grabs him throws him older his shoulder
[56:02] and as he's running back to safety is
[56:05] shot in the back
[56:08] ultimately it destroyed his kidney
[56:10] damaged his spine his bladder
[56:14] and for years
[56:17] for years
[56:19] operation after operation after
[56:21] operation trying to fix it and here was
[56:24] this big robust Brave young man reduced
[56:28] to a hobbling
[56:30] morphine dependent individual
[56:34] and a reporter says I want your story
[56:36] and as he shares his story
[56:39] he finally comes to the Crux and says
[56:42] why would you do that
[56:46] he looks at the reporter in shock
[56:50] why would I do that
[56:52] because he would do it for me
[56:59] and when my dad got too big
[57:02] and I couldn't pay it
[57:05] he did it for me
[57:09] so I'll tell you I'm here today just to
[57:11] give my life to him to serve him do
[57:14] everything I can do
[57:16] do you know his fellow soldiers built
[57:18] him a house that his wheelchair capable
[57:20] or whatever you call it the counters
[57:23] everything is set up for him because
[57:25] they looked at that and said it wasn't
[57:27] just that man in the street if that had
[57:30] been me he would have come for me
[57:33] oh Hallelujah and he came for me
[57:36] he came for you I say thank you Lord I
[57:40] can serve a God Like That
[57:42] Hallelujah
[57:44] Hallelujah now in the identified
[57:46] Masterpiece of God
[57:49] you see sometimes we just think well
[57:51] okay I was born in a message family well
[57:55] remember this scripture says that Moses
[57:57] was to account them from their lineage
[57:59] from their ancestry from the house of
[58:02] their father to trace it all down it's
[58:05] not random my brother and sister or God
[58:07] knows who we are
[58:09] amen so here it is what God is speaking
[58:12] he's trying to show us that this is his
[58:16] plan not my plan

[58:19] businessman
[58:22] you want me to run your life
[58:26] some of you aren't even shaking your
[58:27] head no does that mean there's
[58:29] possibility
[58:31] no sir you don't want Paul to run your
[58:33] life amen because wherever man has his
[58:37] hand
[58:38] man makes mistakes
[58:40] wherever God has his hand his plan is
[58:43] perfect the imperfection is our
[58:47] interpretation of what the plan is
[58:50] amen now he is making a bride yes sir
[58:54] and now some people would say pardon our
[58:57] guests this morning I I don't need to
[58:58] bring it up really I don't think I don't
[59:00] think that you would judge me on this
[59:02] but here we are amen sometimes we say
[59:05] why is my life went this way why is my
[59:06] life went that way you know I if God
[59:08] really cared this wouldn't have happened
[59:10] no he's hewing the chips
[59:13] amen he is molding us into who we are
[59:17] right now chopping off the world oh
[59:20] Church joining Creed's denomination
[59:22] Dogma all has to be cut away from the
[59:25] church their formal ideas their

[59:55] should be amen then there'll be a
[59:58] different thing we've got to come to
[1:00:00] that place that we're ready to say Lord
[1:00:02] if you want to knock this chip off of me
[1:00:04] amen that chip might be the chip of
[1:00:06] attitude amen it might be the chip of
[1:00:09] anointed of a spirit of depression or
[1:00:11] anxiety or fear or lust of the flesh or
[1:00:15] pride of life and God says I want to
[1:00:18] come and knock that chip off of you oh
[1:00:21] Lord have Liberty today just take the
[1:00:25] hammer and knowledge of your word Lord
[1:00:27] and knock that chip off of me
[1:00:31] amen have your way Lord
[1:00:34] then there'll be a different thing then
[1:00:35] if I be lifted up from Earth this is
[1:00:37] Jesus speaking I'll draw all men into me
[1:00:40] yes sir he is cutting you out now
[1:00:43] cutting you down to his word only
[1:00:47] down to his word only
[1:00:51] amen not I go to this church not of this
[1:00:54] opinion not of this education down to
[1:00:57] the word

[1:01:15] amen my brother and sister not Grace
[1:01:17] Tabernacle it's not going to get you
[1:01:19] anywhere
[1:01:22] the ministry of this church is not going
[1:01:24] to get you anywhere
[1:01:26] because even the ministry of this church
[1:01:28] could get staggering a little can get a
[1:01:32] little opinion can get a little
[1:01:33] something
[1:01:34] but God can correct that amen we don't
[1:01:37] just throw the baby out with the bath
[1:01:39] water because the baby cried all last
[1:01:41] night amen the baby's growing up the
[1:01:45] baby's Gonna Learn to say mama my throat
[1:01:48] hurts instead of just crying the baby's
[1:01:51] learning to do this sorry to put this
[1:01:53] this way but at Grace kids the other
[1:01:55] night amen I'll tell you what you just
[1:01:58] realize how fast kids are we're doing
[1:02:00] our little group there with the kids and
[1:02:02] a certain little blonde-haired young man
[1:02:04] he just piles out of his chair and next
[1:02:07] time I know he's standing on the kitchen
[1:02:09] counter and he's got the cabinet door
[1:02:11] open I I understand why he's standing on
[1:02:13] the kitchen counter it put that cabinet
[1:02:16] at eye level
[1:02:18] he wasn't standing here at the floor
[1:02:19] saying I'm thirsty and I need a glass he
[1:02:23] said I can go where the glass is at amen
[1:02:27] I'm like oh I know I'm just going to
[1:02:28] spill it what are you doing Sammy I'm
[1:02:31] thirsty
[1:02:34] well you know that's actually awesome
[1:02:37] because it wasn't long ago he would have
[1:02:39] went to the door and called out to his
[1:02:41] mom
[1:02:43] mom thirsty
[1:02:47] but he's maturing
[1:02:49] amen
[1:02:50] and now he's like I know
[1:02:53] where the glasses are at
[1:02:56] and I know how to operate that little
[1:02:59] deal in the refrigerator
[1:03:04] come on what are we doing we're growing
[1:03:06] up
[1:03:07] we're maturing
[1:03:09] we've heard a calling
[1:03:11] amen
[1:03:16] Jesus couldn't take the place you
[1:03:18] remember when they read that day in the
[1:03:20] book he just read part of the prophecy
[1:03:22] left the rest of it for the last days
[1:03:24] we're supposed to take that part now
[1:03:27] that's the reason I use Lil Sammy as the
[1:03:29] example my brother and sister he doesn't
[1:03:31] go over there and try and put he
[1:03:32] probably has but time put his mouth
[1:03:34] against the deal in the fridge he
[1:03:36] doesn't go over there with a plate to
[1:03:38] get water from the fridge he doesn't go
[1:03:40] over there with a knife fork or a spoon
[1:03:42] to get a drink of water he knows what it
[1:03:45] takes to get a drink of water and when
[1:03:48] this prophecy was spoken and Jesus cut
[1:03:51] that off he knew the pride of this last
[1:03:54] day would be able to come and pick that
[1:03:57] prophecy up and would know what to do
[1:04:00] with that prophecy
[1:04:02] it's not enough to say God sent a
[1:04:04] prophet good the devil knows that but
[1:04:07] that prophecy of this day was a
[1:04:10] fulfillment of the word
[1:04:12] amen aren't you glad you can lift a hand
[1:04:14] today and say I am the Fulfillment of
[1:04:16] the word for this hour
[1:04:18] I'm not just an individual that is going
[1:04:21] to a church I am an integral
[1:04:24] identified named part of this prophecy
[1:04:30] Hallelujah
[1:04:31] amen
[1:04:36] we're supposed to take that part so you
[1:04:38] see he is cut and wants to cut the
[1:04:39] church out just like he did the Sun out
[1:04:42] like he did the bride and the groom to
[1:04:45] be his bride you must be part of him
[1:04:50] not a part of the Creed
[1:04:52] not a part of the church not a part of
[1:04:54] denomination but a part of him hewed out
[1:04:58] go look up the word hude
[1:05:01] that is not kind words and soft music
[1:05:04] that is a force
[1:05:07] carving cutting
[1:05:09] chiseling
[1:05:11] away
[1:05:13] sometimes with excessive force I don't
[1:05:16] like how hard the preacher preaches well
[1:05:19] then healed
[1:05:21] because if God wants you you doubt he'll
[1:05:23] just keep getting a bigger hammer
[1:05:25] amen until we'll come to a place and say
[1:05:27] Lord I'm okay Lord I acknowledge I'm
[1:05:30] yours and I want to be yours
[1:05:33] amen
[1:05:35] now it's not hard-headed people you're
[1:05:37] not hard-headed people other people are
[1:05:40] hard-headed people
[1:05:41] well that's what I always hear
[1:05:43] hard-headed people saying if they
[1:05:45] weren't so hard-headed
[1:05:51] but God will bring us to a place that
[1:05:53] finally will say if I hadn't been so
[1:05:56] hard-headed
[1:05:58] if I hadn't pushed back against God's
[1:06:01] will
[1:06:02] I wouldn't have had the hand as a lamb
[1:06:05] my leg broken
[1:06:07] imagine
[1:06:09] the counter-type story
[1:06:11] of the Lamb with a broken leg
[1:06:14] as it is over his shoulder going by
[1:06:17] everyone he broke my leg
[1:06:20] my leg
[1:06:24] my leg egg
[1:06:26] but what's the true story
[1:06:29] the little lamb falls in love with the
[1:06:31] shepherd
[1:06:32] he's with the shepherd He Walks With A
[1:06:34] Shepherd he sleeps with the shepherd and
[1:06:37] when the cast comes from his leg he
[1:06:39] wants to be where the shepherd's at
[1:06:42] now let's not have any complaints about
[1:06:43] what God has done in your life
[1:06:46] amen he did that to get you to follow
[1:06:49] him be close to him never want to be
[1:06:51] separated from him amen not to go
[1:06:54] through life saying God did this to me
[1:06:58] what's wrong what's the struggle God
[1:07:02] no what's wrong and the struggle put
[1:07:05] your name there
[1:07:06] huh amen
[1:07:11] you got to be huge
[1:07:18] not huge from
[1:07:25] you mentioned
[1:07:28] God healing you from the word amen you
[1:07:32] know what that means Saints
[1:07:33] come on somebody let's get excited that
[1:07:36] means I was in there you were in there
[1:07:38] to be hewed from the word you had to be
[1:07:42] in the word
[1:07:43] otherwise you couldn't be hewed from the
[1:07:46] word God's not going to go out here and
[1:07:48] laodicea in this uh Satan's Eden and Hue
[1:07:52] something out bring it in sprinkle a
[1:07:54] little water on it and call it his you
[1:07:56] were in the word and God hewed you out
[1:07:58] of the word and identified by the word
[1:08:01] who you was
[1:08:03] oh my brother and sister have you ever
[1:08:06] noticed the world we live in now when
[1:08:08] Moses
[1:08:09] the statue of Moses was carved out
[1:08:12] you don't find any laminate lamination
[1:08:14] lines
[1:08:18] God carved that out of a rock
[1:08:21] amen who did that DaVinci
[1:08:26] Michelangelo I knew I wouldn't get that
[1:08:28] right
[1:08:29] you know I study them guys so often
[1:08:33] Michelangelo
[1:08:34] he didn't go down to the rock quarry and
[1:08:36] say I like the color of that Little Rock
[1:08:38] and I like this rock and I like that
[1:08:40] rock can somebody glue these all
[1:08:41] together
[1:08:43] no he went down there and here's this
[1:08:46] giant hunk of rock and he knew it was
[1:08:48] the right Rock because by Vision he saw
[1:08:51] Moses in that rock
[1:08:52] oh are you with me amen we don't need to
[1:08:57] laminate the word of God together God
[1:08:59] took his word and when he looked in his
[1:09:02] word and turned it every way he said I
[1:09:04] see you I see a bride in my word and I'm
[1:09:09] gonna chip here and I'm gonna chip there
[1:09:11] and I'm gonna carve away here and sand a
[1:09:14] little there and lo and behold after
[1:09:17] many moments
[1:09:19] no sir
[1:09:21] years
[1:09:22] and we get all impatient Lord why did I
[1:09:25] how did this happen I thought I was more
[1:09:27] better Christian I thought this I
[1:09:28] thought that years
[1:09:31] of polishing
[1:09:33] years of bringing it back
[1:09:37] but you know what happens
[1:09:39] we as humans with human reactions see
[1:09:42] the word coming
[1:09:44] and we know
[1:09:45] those things in our life need to be
[1:09:47] taken away
[1:09:48] but the words coming
[1:09:50] and we're like going
[1:09:55] God's trying to change me again
[1:09:59] well I'll tell you my brother and sister
[1:10:01] if your son or daughter of God you might
[1:10:04] as well and we'll get to a quote here if
[1:10:06] I get to the quote amen
[1:10:09] you've got to be hewed from the word the
[1:10:11] world cut off of you just leave the word
[1:10:14] only live in you the great sculptor is
[1:10:17] counting on you willing to stand and
[1:10:21] have yourself shaped into the likeness
[1:10:23] of his requirement that his word
[1:10:26] requires one of none of this cringing
[1:10:29] none of this Lord I want to do what I
[1:10:31] want to do but to come and say Lord you
[1:10:34] would not have called me you would not
[1:10:36] have put this in my life you were not a
[1:10:39] place of seed in here if you were gonna
[1:10:41] just chip my arm off
[1:10:43] amen if you were gonna just carve me
[1:10:46] into another image amen come on let's
[1:10:48] have confidence in God let's trust God
[1:10:51] and just stop and stand there and say
[1:10:54] Lord what it is you want me to be I'm
[1:10:56] Gonna Let You Lord I'm gonna stand here
[1:10:59] I'm not gonna run I'm not gonna hide I'm
[1:11:02] not gonna cringe I'm not gonna Rebel I'm
[1:11:05] going to stand
[1:11:12] brother Ivan I always refer to him as
[1:11:14] brother Ivan senior
[1:11:16] Amen to separate our brothers
[1:11:18] our brother Ivan
[1:11:20] shared for years story Believers there
[1:11:26] Iron Curtain I guess you would call it
[1:11:29] Bibles being thrown over the fence
[1:11:31] soldiers raking the sand to see any
[1:11:34] footprints
[1:11:36] and a young man
[1:11:38] caught soldiers appearing so suddenly he
[1:11:41] doesn't know where to go
[1:11:43] and he's caught now I'm telling you
[1:11:46] right now
[1:11:47] I consider myself to be a reasonably
[1:11:49] Brave person
[1:11:52] my first instinct
[1:11:54] what all they would be is like
[1:11:57] that smells like dust and that looks
[1:11:58] like dust
[1:12:01] but what did he do
[1:12:02] he's like Lord help me
[1:12:05] and it was though he was paralyzed he's
[1:12:07] standing by the fence
[1:12:10] with a box of Bibles
[1:12:13] Lord help me
[1:12:16] God doesn't send a mighty Angel and slay
[1:12:18] them in he doesn't send bolts of
[1:12:20] lightning he doesn't whatever what does
[1:12:23] he do he paralyzes the man
[1:12:25] for the man wants to run but he can't
[1:12:29] the man wants to flee for his life
[1:12:31] because that's the only thing is like
[1:12:33] fight fright and he doesn't have
[1:12:35] anything to fight with but he did
[1:12:36] because he was holding the very Living
[1:12:38] Word of God in his hands and God just
[1:12:42] caused him to stand there and these men
[1:12:44] if you don't think this isn't miraculous
[1:12:46] these men are under command back in
[1:12:48] those days our brothers and sisters that
[1:12:50] grew up in that world you know what that
[1:12:52] was like they enforced the rules they
[1:12:54] didn't care about the peasants as it
[1:12:56] were and these men with their rifles
[1:12:58] their automatic rifles are walking down
[1:13:01] the deal and they walk right by this man
[1:13:05] amen my brother and sister are we need
[1:13:08] God to help us it's no time for the
[1:13:10] bride of Christ to decide we need to run
[1:13:13] and find some other place of refuse it's
[1:13:16] time for us to say Lord help me and we
[1:13:20] have the very word of God the very
[1:13:23] flaming sword of almighty God is in our
[1:13:27] hands to defend ourselves and so
[1:13:29] sometimes God's defense is just to wait
[1:13:33] and she'll love that the song this
[1:13:35] morning Hallelujah I just Rejoice my
[1:13:38] brother and sister sometime God's answer
[1:13:40] for us is just wait
[1:13:46] oh
[1:13:47] help me move on Lord
[1:13:50] Hallelujah
[1:13:56] not part of a Creed not part of a church
[1:13:57] not part of a denomination but part of
[1:13:59] him
[1:14:00] hewed out of any other kind of form
[1:14:02] won't work you've got to be heed from
[1:14:04] the word the world cut off of you
[1:14:08] and I'll just tell you right now just be
[1:14:10] open God's still cutting the world off
[1:14:11] of me amen there's little things you
[1:14:14] know that we just have little things
[1:14:16] that are just you might say well that's
[1:14:17] just being human well my brother and
[1:14:19] sister I'm not just a human I'm a Son of
[1:14:21] God your sons and daughters of God not
[1:14:24] just humans
[1:14:25] otherwise that's our excuse to do
[1:14:27] everything from robbing banks to doing
[1:14:29] drugs
[1:14:30] amen I'm just human
[1:14:37] the world world cut off of you just
[1:14:39] leave the word only live in you the
[1:14:42] great sculptor counting on you
[1:14:44] hope you don't mind me reading this
[1:14:46] again willing to stand and have yourself
[1:14:49] shaped into the likeness of his
[1:14:51] requirement that his word requires and
[1:14:54] the last days I'll pour out my spirit
[1:14:55] upon All Flesh now Hallelujah your sons
[1:14:59] and daughters shall prophesy Christ is
[1:15:02] the identified Masterpiece of the word
[1:15:04] made flesh you're asked to identify
[1:15:08] yourself in him by the same word to be a
[1:15:11] masterpiece for the bride he knows the
[1:15:14] prophet of God says your ask
[1:15:16] you'll find nowhere in this equation God
[1:15:18] forced you to be
[1:15:20] right that you'll find that people that
[1:15:22] are struggling will say well I just feel
[1:15:23] when I go to church I'm forced
[1:15:26] come on let's stop
[1:15:27] what spirit is telling you that God's
[1:15:29] trying to force you to serve him
[1:15:32] I remember a brother preaching one time
[1:15:34] and I've thought about plagiarizing his
[1:15:36] sermon God has no hostages
[1:15:40] I thought it was such a phenomenal title
[1:15:42] God has no hostages
[1:15:46] um
[1:15:48] praise the Lord amen now as we look at
[1:15:51] this my brother and sister
[1:15:52] I want you to catch this for a moment
[1:15:54] please just really focus I'm trying to
[1:15:56] hurry along
[1:15:57] the Lamb's Book of Life
[1:16:00] it's not a book containing every name
[1:16:05] are you with me
[1:16:07] it's not a book that contains every name
[1:16:13] and as men fail
[1:16:15] their name is scratched out of the book
[1:16:20] that's not what the Lamb's Book of Life
[1:16:21] is
[1:16:22] you fail look it up pick on the young
[1:16:25] people
[1:16:28] made a mistake sorry
[1:16:33] made a mistake
[1:16:38] the Lamb's Book of Life my brother and
[1:16:40] sister
[1:16:42] it's not a book with names scratched out
[1:16:44] of it until there's only a few names
[1:16:45] left
[1:16:46] because the scripture says None is
[1:16:49] perfect no not one so what would that do
[1:16:53] it would leave a book with every name
[1:16:55] scratched out
[1:16:57] but I love the fact that the Lamb's Book
[1:16:59] of Life
[1:17:00] is a book not of the perfect in
[1:17:03] themselves
[1:17:05] but the perfect in Christ
[1:17:09] how do I get perfect in Christ by
[1:17:11] standing and letting him Hew the world
[1:17:14] off of us
[1:17:17] it's the standing my brother and sisters
[1:17:19] that actually is what is making now take
[1:17:22] this in an overall context please
[1:17:24] it's the standing is what makes us
[1:17:26] perfect
[1:17:27] because he's not going to stop until he
[1:17:29] has made you into the perfect image
[1:17:32] God's not like us you know you're
[1:17:36] working I just did this a couple days
[1:17:37] ago working on something and I'm like
[1:17:40] I've got to finish this I got to finish
[1:17:41] this today I can't quit this day until I
[1:17:43] have this finished my phone rings you
[1:17:44] want to go do this yeah bye
[1:17:48] it was so important
[1:17:50] that I dropped it like a hot potato and
[1:17:52] ran
[1:17:53] that's not God
[1:17:55] said I've started to mold you into my
[1:17:58] perfect image
[1:17:59] and I'm not going to stop
[1:18:02] until you were there
[1:18:04] but we haven't the idea that it would be
[1:18:07] like the OCD compulsive worker
[1:18:10] he got this human
[1:18:12] and he could not stop until he just
[1:18:14] carved him into what he's supposed to be
[1:18:15] kept looking at the blueprint
[1:18:19] God says no problem I know your days
[1:18:23] I know you're beginning and I know your
[1:18:25] end
[1:18:26] and I'm not going to inflict as it is a
[1:18:29] pain upon you in this sense but I'm just
[1:18:31] going to mold you
[1:18:34] mold you
[1:18:35] mold you
[1:18:37] mold you
[1:18:39] heard the word when I was a little boy
[1:18:43] I don't know nine years old or something
[1:18:46] he's still molding amen
[1:18:50] thank you Lord
[1:18:52] he never gave up he never quit he said I
[1:18:55] know who you are I know you're lineage I
[1:18:57] know who your father is I know where you
[1:18:59] come from and I know where you're going
[1:19:01] and I'm just going to keep molding you
[1:19:03] until I bring you and not only that I
[1:19:06] put a name on you
[1:19:08] not my daddy giving me a name my mama
[1:19:10] giving me a name
[1:19:11] my God
[1:19:14] my Creator My Savior my heavenly father
[1:19:17] Alba father said I put my name on you
[1:19:20] that's how you'll be identified
[1:19:23] amen
[1:19:24] now look
[1:19:28] what is the Lamb's Book of Life
[1:19:32] well we can give all kinds of
[1:19:33] explanations
[1:19:36] can I give mine
[1:19:39] well I guess so as one told me once well
[1:19:41] you're the only one Speaking
[1:19:44] okay thank you for permission
[1:19:48] the Lamb's Book of Life is the name
[1:19:51] of the renowned
[1:19:54] of the congregation
[1:19:57] the renowned
[1:19:59] what is the renowned
[1:20:02] the incompetent incomplete unusable
[1:20:05] rejected
[1:20:07] no sir those that have excelled
[1:20:10] those that have risen up now we might
[1:20:12] never be recognized as renowned on the
[1:20:15] face of this Earth but your life and the
[1:20:18] desire of your heart is putting you in a
[1:20:19] position God looks down and says this is
[1:20:22] the renowned
[1:20:24] this is those that are famous in my
[1:20:27] house
[1:20:28] now I'll tell you what I might not be
[1:20:30] famous in your house but I like to be
[1:20:32] famous in my house
[1:20:34] amen I like it when my grandkids come in
[1:20:36] the door my daughter son-in-law come in
[1:20:39] the door amen and they're like hi
[1:20:42] Grandpa
[1:20:44] hi Dad hey how are you oh love you
[1:20:48] oh or I'm feeling
[1:20:50] now I don't expect to go to your house
[1:20:52] and have your grandkids run and throw
[1:20:54] their arms around my neck and say
[1:20:56] grandpa
[1:20:58] hmm
[1:21:01] be renowned well we're renowned in God's
[1:21:04] house
[1:21:05] in God's congregation my brother and
[1:21:07] sister we are renowned we are known
[1:21:10] amen
[1:21:12] amen he's common he's numbered us as
[1:21:15] Warriors of his kingdom
[1:21:17] and he has aligned us
[1:21:20] in our genealogy
[1:21:22] I've shared with the church you know and
[1:21:24] I just share it very briefly hear hope
[1:21:26] but you know I always thought I was
[1:21:28] German I blamed all kinds of behaviors
[1:21:30] on them poor Germans
[1:21:33] man I can see the whole nation of
[1:21:35] Germany just smarting under that false
[1:21:37] accusation you acted like that because
[1:21:39] you were a German no you acted like that
[1:21:42] because you had a stubborn Spirit on you
[1:21:48] and all the years and generations of the
[1:21:51] Germans are like
[1:21:52] they just painted us with a black brush
[1:21:56] well Germans are stubborn but anyway
[1:22:01] so we
[1:22:03] we look in this genealogy
[1:22:07] come on I just feel led to hit this
[1:22:08] because I just hear people I hear people
[1:22:11] still falling back on these things
[1:22:13] they fall back on these things we're
[1:22:16] Irish
[1:22:18] really
[1:22:20] I'm Welsh
[1:22:22] I'm artistic because I'm this
[1:22:25] I'm smart because I'm that
[1:22:29] well I tell you what I don't know about
[1:22:30] your genealogy
[1:22:32] but mine goes back before there ever was
[1:22:36] a foundation
[1:22:38] mind goes back before anybody cared
[1:22:41] about the value of Rembrandt
[1:22:43] and Van Gogh and of this and of that
[1:22:47] long before they invented the Corvette
[1:22:50] and the Lamborghini amen my lineage goes
[1:22:53] back amen I don't need to come from a
[1:22:55] family that attained great wealth my
[1:22:58] brother and sister because my father
[1:23:00] owns it all
[1:23:02] I don't gotta go identify with this
[1:23:05] world I can identify in my world and my
[1:23:09] world is my heavenly father amen the
[1:23:12] family of God is who I am
[1:23:15] amen not attend here not there
[1:23:17] Hallelujah
[1:23:21] you know I always love that Reddit deal
[1:23:23] sometime back there was a family had
[1:23:25] several sons and daughters
[1:23:27] and as the little girls were growing up
[1:23:30] they were pretty little girls
[1:23:32] every little girl is pretty amen but
[1:23:34] that was there and they were encouraged
[1:23:36] to marry a handsome man with money
[1:23:40] should we preach that here
[1:23:43] no because it begins the word
[1:23:46] amen prophet of God said Mary a mount's
[1:23:49] got the Holy Ghost and got character
[1:23:51] that was the two priorities he placed on
[1:23:53] top of the list I imagine that the
[1:23:55] prophet of God if he was standing here
[1:23:56] would say you know if that man young man
[1:23:58] with character in the Holy Ghost has
[1:24:00] some money young lady you have hit the
[1:24:02] gold mine
[1:24:05] but if they have money no character
[1:24:08] have money and don't have the Holy Ghost
[1:24:11] I think what the prophet say about that
[1:24:13] one couple
[1:24:14] he would make her life
[1:24:16] hell on Earth
[1:24:19] who wants to sign up today for hell on
[1:24:21] Earth
[1:24:25] anyway so this
[1:24:27] this family quite wealthy generational
[1:24:30] wealth
[1:24:32] encouraging their children young men
[1:24:34] you don't go shopping for a wife over
[1:24:36] here you go amongst those of the wealth
[1:24:40] of the class of your level
[1:24:43] well one day one of the sons appears at
[1:24:46] the house in midterm of a College
[1:24:49] semester
[1:24:50] the dad's like
[1:24:54] what's wrong son
[1:24:56] said dad you're not going to be happy
[1:24:57] with me in fact I kind of think I'll
[1:24:59] just collect my stuff up because you're
[1:25:01] probably just going to kick me out
[1:25:04] and he says what are you talking about
[1:25:05] did you do something illegal
[1:25:08] he said no dad
[1:25:10] I just decided after this great struggle
[1:25:14] I'm going to be me
[1:25:17] I want to be an artist
[1:25:20] the dad looked at him and stunned
[1:25:22] silence
[1:25:26] but true right out of the Bible
[1:25:28] the dad had a moment and said wait I
[1:25:31] don't agree with you
[1:25:33] but you are my son
[1:25:38] nothing will change that
[1:25:40] and I forgotten the name it's one of the
[1:25:43] American painters that
[1:25:45] um
[1:25:46] you know when the sun sold his first
[1:25:48] painting this is way back like I think
[1:25:49] in the early 1900s sold his first
[1:25:52] painting for fifty thousand dollars
[1:25:55] dad said my confidence was not misplaced
[1:26:00] and he went on to be an accomplice
[1:26:02] painter
[1:26:04] and the family was proud of him and hung
[1:26:06] his paintings all through their family
[1:26:09] homes
[1:26:11] you see my brother and sister it doesn't
[1:26:13] matter
[1:26:14] how we see ourself
[1:26:16] we've got to be ourself
[1:26:20] and I don't know about you but the only
[1:26:22] thing I really cherish any longer
[1:26:25] is being a son of God
[1:26:28] because this world's not my home I don't
[1:26:29] fit in here
[1:26:31] I don't fit in here
[1:26:33] I don't belong here I've been an oddball
[1:26:35] my whole childhood
[1:26:37] my whole teenage years my whole early
[1:26:41] married life I'm glad that God sent a
[1:26:43] young lady into my life that could
[1:26:45] accept me for being the weird guy that I
[1:26:48] am
[1:26:50] people are like you're confident you're
[1:26:52] confident I'm telling you I'm more
[1:26:54] insecure than most of you put together
[1:26:57] but how do you hide insecurity
[1:27:00] with a bold front
[1:27:04] but I'm glad I'm insecure
[1:27:06] I got no security in land I got no
[1:27:09] security and money I got no security and
[1:27:11] business ability I got no security and
[1:27:14] none of this my security is in Jesus
[1:27:16] Christ and Christ Alone
[1:27:19] Hallelujah
[1:27:22] amen see look what it is my brother and
[1:27:26] sister are heritage
[1:27:28] we can be aligned in our genealogy we
[1:27:30] can be aligned in our heritage in the
[1:27:33] natural and be proud of what family we
[1:27:35] come from unless you're not and uh you
[1:27:37] know it is but the thing is is this is
[1:27:40] what Satan's trying to do in this hour
[1:27:42] is to confuse who our father is
[1:27:48] and the minute we walk away from God
[1:27:50] we're saying I don't know who my father
[1:27:53] is
[1:27:55] and the devil walks in and says you know
[1:27:57] what
[1:27:58] I know you have this insecurity
[1:28:00] I'll step in I'll be
[1:28:02] a surrogate father to you
[1:28:06] you want pleasure here's pleasure
[1:28:10] you want this here it is
[1:28:13] you want to be your own person here it
[1:28:16] is
[1:28:20] I'll tell you what I I thank God I had
[1:28:22] Parents
[1:28:23] that corrected me amen
[1:28:26] parents that come along and says oh son
[1:28:28] I'll help you get your first pickup you
[1:28:30] will pay me back
[1:28:32] and you will make all the payments and
[1:28:34] the day you can't pay for your insurance
[1:28:36] or your payments or your gas it'll just
[1:28:38] park right there
[1:28:41] I thank God for that
[1:28:43] amen and I thank God that every time
[1:28:45] I've got an idea in a spiritual realm
[1:28:48] that I just thought well you know praise
[1:28:50] God
[1:28:51] I hope this don't offend none of you
[1:28:53] I can just stay home
[1:28:55] and be just as spiritual as everyone
[1:28:57] else
[1:29:02] and God says oh
[1:29:05] we'll see about that
[1:29:07] we'll see about that
[1:29:10] how you doing Paul
[1:29:14] doing great
[1:29:16] everything's just so wonderful
[1:29:21] and grown men cry themselves to sleep at
[1:29:24] night
[1:29:26] why
[1:29:27] because without him
[1:29:31] we're just empty shells
[1:29:34] oh we don't feel like empty shelves
[1:29:37] you know brother Brown kind of talked
[1:29:39] about that
[1:29:40] the clothes some of you are wearing is
[1:29:42] worth more than your body is
[1:29:46] especially your sisters wearing them
[1:29:48] nice shoes
[1:29:50] I couldn't help but say that
[1:29:54] see now there's
[1:29:57] gifts placed in the body
[1:30:00] there's gifts placed in the body but
[1:30:01] brother Brown shows us very clearly the
[1:30:03] greatest gift ever placed in the body
[1:30:05] was Jesus Christ
[1:30:07] amen but looking in this natural amen
[1:30:09] look what God's equipped you to do
[1:30:12] amen We've Got Musicians and we've got
[1:30:14] people who sing beautifully and we have
[1:30:16] gifts to to be doctors and you know
[1:30:20] smart mathematics to decorate you know
[1:30:23] just all these gifts that God's placed
[1:30:24] in the body amen sister Alice I still it
[1:30:27] was there in the fridge I still look at
[1:30:29] it Marvel amen she got more education
[1:30:31] above and beyond High School than I got
[1:30:33] in all my life
[1:30:35] amen what God give her that gift to be
[1:30:37] able and discipline the gifts no good
[1:30:40] without discipline to go with it
[1:30:43] so we can sit back and say I'm a
[1:30:45] daughter of God I'm a Son of God now
[1:30:47] Lord just pour blessings out no God says
[1:30:50] what I want you to do is get down and
[1:30:53] dig for those I want you to commit
[1:30:56] yourself I want you to be sincere I want
[1:30:59] you to press to the mark of the high
[1:31:01] golly you notice that's what the
[1:31:02] scripture says press it doesn't say
[1:31:05] Coast or fall or anything else it says
[1:31:08] press and press requires efforts
[1:31:12] amen press to the mark of the High
[1:31:14] Calling amen but look at this God knows
[1:31:18] what he's equipped you to do
[1:31:20] now the devil's going to tell you it's
[1:31:22] much better to take the pleasures
[1:31:25] of this Earth it's easier
[1:31:27] is it really
[1:31:29] I ask you is it really easier
[1:31:34] to settle for the pleasures
[1:31:36] of this world
[1:31:43] I want to get into any morbid stuff so
[1:31:45] I'll just leave this alone but I can
[1:31:47] tell you right now them rich people
[1:31:49] or more miserable than you think they
[1:31:52] are
[1:31:53] oh they're rich life must be so good
[1:31:57] okay
[1:31:59] but I'm here to tell you it's not true
[1:32:02] the devil has projected an image
[1:32:06] and the world loves the glossy image
[1:32:12] now
[1:32:13] so God knows what he's equipped you to
[1:32:15] do
[1:32:16] he knows what he's called you to do
[1:32:19] he knows where he's called you to go
[1:32:21] that's
[1:32:22] now I want to take a little example my
[1:32:24] brother and sister you see the world
[1:32:26] can't take you or God has called you to
[1:32:29] go
[1:32:32] I hope you grasp that the world this
[1:32:34] world cannot take you where God
[1:32:36] who to go
[1:32:37] amen and God I can assure you never
[1:32:40] called you to try and fail
[1:32:42] now we turn to Hebrews 11 and 29. don't
[1:32:46] you just love Hebrews 11 I find myself
[1:32:49] just reading this all the time and God's
[1:32:51] speaking to me from Hebrews 11. amen but
[1:32:55] look at this I want you to understand my
[1:32:57] brother and sister that as they have
[1:32:59] moved out of Egypt and they had dealt
[1:33:02] with all that was Egypt and they've come
[1:33:04] to a place that they are there and many
[1:33:07] murmured many complain what was it it
[1:33:09] was the seed that Satan desired to plant
[1:33:13] in them that plagued Israel to this very
[1:33:16] day
[1:33:17] that seed that was there that God said
[1:33:20] it but he hasn't fulfilled it you go to
[1:33:23] Israel they are there many of them will
[1:33:25] say God promised this but he has not
[1:33:28] fulfilled it what if the prophet of God
[1:33:30] tell you and I if God said you're healed
[1:33:33] you walk out saying I am healed if God
[1:33:38] says I've delivered you from this in
[1:33:40] your life anxiety depressions this that
[1:33:43] and the other then you go forward saying
[1:33:46] I am delivered in the name of Jesus
[1:33:48] Christ but look at this Spirit on Israel
[1:33:50] they're still declaring God hasn't
[1:33:53] fulfilled it well I'll stand here right
[1:33:55] now and whatever afflictions are in my
[1:33:58] body my God has already delivered he's
[1:34:01] already come on the scene he's already
[1:34:03] gave it to me and I claim it amen I'm
[1:34:07] not going to sit back and say when I see
[1:34:09] God move I'll move amen I'm going to
[1:34:12] move whether I see the outward
[1:34:14] expression of God moving or not
[1:34:17] and that's the difference between the
[1:34:19] Gentile
[1:34:20] and the Jew
[1:34:22] as we were called to take the word
[1:34:25] stand up declare it and go forward
[1:34:29] amen
[1:34:30] they were given that in principle
[1:34:33] footsteps or possession yes
[1:34:37] but Israel
[1:34:39] 17 percent
[1:34:42] they occupy 17 of the land God gave them
[1:34:48] I brought this up in the service before
[1:34:49] I'm going to speak it with strength I
[1:34:51] don't want to make it personal or
[1:34:52] definitely an insult but I want to know
[1:34:54] what portion of the promise God has
[1:34:57] given you are you occupying
[1:35:02] and there'll be none amongst us that can
[1:35:04] stand and say I've done it all none of
[1:35:06] us can stand and be boastful about this
[1:35:09] but I'll tell you what it does it calls
[1:35:11] to my attention Lord there's much more
[1:35:13] for me to possess I don't need to just
[1:35:17] settle down and say well praise God God
[1:35:19] sent a prophet no sir I am the recipient
[1:35:22] of an investment that God made and he
[1:35:25] said the return on that investment is
[1:35:27] you
[1:35:29] praise the Lord that's a whole nother
[1:35:31] sermon I scratched a whole chunk of that
[1:35:33] out today because it looked like an
[1:35:35] encyclopedia amen now look at this
[1:35:38] Hebrews 11 29. by faith they pass
[1:35:42] through the Red Sea as by dry land which
[1:35:45] Egyptians are saying to do were drowned
[1:35:48] you see they can't go where you can go
[1:35:52] in the day and age we live in
[1:35:55] Satan cannot go where you're called to
[1:35:58] go
[1:36:00] the world cannot go where Sons and
[1:36:03] Daughters of God are called to go
[1:36:06] aren't you glad you're a son or daughter
[1:36:07] of God
[1:36:09] Hallelujah
[1:36:10] is not to be taken boastfully my brother
[1:36:12] and sister
[1:36:14] this is to be taken because it is God's
[1:36:16] word
[1:36:17] amen amen so in the light
[1:36:19] we'll look at this my brother and sister
[1:36:22] they say we're walking in the light what
[1:36:24] light is that
[1:36:26] amen now in the seventh Church ages here
[1:36:31] uh
[1:36:32] says no one could deny that Israel had
[1:36:35] light
[1:36:36] they were the only people who had light
[1:36:38] as a nation
[1:36:41] it was as when Egypt was so dark that
[1:36:45] one could feel it
[1:36:48] I think we're in Egypt
[1:36:54] I think we're in Egypt Saints
[1:36:58] because I don't know about you I don't
[1:36:59] even like to go to the grocery store
[1:37:00] anymore
[1:37:03] you know it's almost as though
[1:37:05] maybe my attitude isn't always right is
[1:37:07] that okay for me to admit that
[1:37:10] I might be in the store
[1:37:13] I'm pushing a car sister Joe will be
[1:37:15] like just look straight ahead
[1:37:21] are we past yeah it's okay
[1:37:27] Darkness around us
[1:37:32] you go oh
[1:37:36] go over here let's go over here this
[1:37:37] seems like this would be no bad idea
[1:37:43] I think we'll just go back where
[1:37:46] we feel comfortable
[1:37:49] home
[1:37:52] it's a prophet of God says in Israel
[1:37:54] they had light in the house
[1:37:56] it was gross Darkness outside
[1:37:58] but there was light
[1:38:00] in the house
[1:38:03] we don't want to become homebody so we
[1:38:05] might just drop in on you okay
[1:38:07] because there'll be light in your house
[1:38:10] amen when the death angel was moving
[1:38:12] through Egypt amen what did he do you
[1:38:15] know my brother and sister I say this is
[1:38:17] just a type bear with me
[1:38:19] he didn't have to go along and say let's
[1:38:21] get over here and see if there's blood
[1:38:22] on that
[1:38:24] there was light
[1:38:26] and the gospel is our light
[1:38:29] brother Brown says Jesus Christ
[1:38:32] is the light of the world as the
[1:38:33] scripture says he's our light
[1:38:36] Hallelujah aren't you glad
[1:38:39] makes my heart
[1:38:40] amen but in the homes of the Israelite
[1:38:43] there was light and so now True light
[1:38:46] has come the light of the world is Jesus
[1:38:48] Moses and the prophets brought the light
[1:38:50] by means of the scripture relative to
[1:38:53] the Messiah thus Israel had light now I
[1:38:56] want to just here again I find myself
[1:38:58] kind of speaking a little strongly this
[1:39:00] morning maybe don't want no one to be
[1:39:01] offended but my brother and sister some
[1:39:03] are receiving a light but it's not
[1:39:06] complete light
[1:39:07] amen now I'm just going to go ahead and
[1:39:09] say it I hope it's not offensive to
[1:39:11] anyone God sent a prophet
[1:39:13] that's light
[1:39:16] amen but what did the prophet bring
[1:39:19] more light
[1:39:21] so it was like to recognize that God
[1:39:23] sent a prophet but the prophet was a
[1:39:26] carrier to show us more light
[1:39:29] so we have light when we stop there that
[1:39:32] God sent a prophet but we are not
[1:39:34] wanting to settle for a partial light as
[1:39:37] the prophet of God see this is all right
[1:39:39] attached to Wednesday night a partial
[1:39:41] realization amen that we don't I'm not
[1:39:44] going to settle for partial realism
[1:39:45] relation I want light
[1:39:49] I didn't say give me this much light
[1:39:51] Lord give me this much light Lord give
[1:39:53] me this much light I want light
[1:39:55] amen
[1:39:57] amen so there it is my brother and
[1:40:00] sister but now the true light has come
[1:40:02] the light of the world is Jesus Moses
[1:40:04] and the prophets I already read this
[1:40:05] amen lie about means the scripture
[1:40:08] relative to the Messiah thus Israel had
[1:40:10] light but now the Fulfillment of the
[1:40:13] light has come and what was but glowing
[1:40:16] word has now broken forth in the
[1:40:18] brightness of God manifested among his
[1:40:21] people as the pillar of fire gave light
[1:40:24] at night and that was wonderful now
[1:40:26] light and life were manifest in the
[1:40:29] fullness of the godhead bodily isn't
[1:40:31] that beautiful amen it was manifested in
[1:40:34] the fullness of the godhead bodily and
[1:40:36] then you really are gonna like this amen
[1:40:38] you've got to stay
[1:40:41] with that word
[1:40:43] to be the bride
[1:40:45] if you're in the bride you're in the
[1:40:47] word and the word is in you and the word
[1:40:50] that reflected God through Christ
[1:40:52] reflects the same God through you amen
[1:40:56] amen be so be it so be it I believe it
[1:40:59] to be the truth you have to be
[1:41:01] identified with him amen sister vika
[1:41:05] will you come

[1:41:09] identified in this body of Christ
[1:41:11] Amen to be counted it is his bride to be
[1:41:14] identified in his name Mrs Jesus Christ
[1:41:18] amen yet I remember one time and I don't
[1:41:20] say this negative but to make a point
[1:41:22] I'm talking along a certain line like
[1:41:24] that as a bride and a bridegroom husband
[1:41:27] and a wife in a relationship and I
[1:41:29] remember this lady one time going ooh
[1:41:31] that's icky
[1:41:34] really
[1:41:35] you have children
[1:41:38] and you can't draw this into a spiritual
[1:41:40] relationship to have a relationship with
[1:41:43] Jesus Christ my brother and sister don't
[1:41:45] let it be intellectual
[1:41:46] let it be real Let It Be life
[1:41:49] amen
[1:41:51] Hallelujah Mrs Jesus Christ amen not the
[1:41:55] Bride of Satan's Eden

[1:42:16] spiritually
[1:42:18] physically
[1:42:21] [Music]
[1:42:23] I just read a little deal a while back
[1:42:25] man's wealthy worth a few hundred
[1:42:27] million dollars
[1:42:29] somebody asked him he says so how is it
[1:42:32] man in your position influence and
[1:42:33] everything that you have in a world that
[1:42:36] there's so much turmoil
[1:42:38] how is it that you've been married for
[1:42:40] 30 years to your wife and you seem so
[1:42:43] happy
[1:42:44] [Music]
[1:42:45] and he said the first mistake you made
[1:42:49] is you attach money and happiness in the
[1:42:51] same sentence
[1:42:53] the second mistake you made
[1:42:55] was who I am
[1:42:57] in relationship to that money has
[1:43:01] nothing to do with the relationship with
[1:43:04] my wife
[1:43:06] I thought wow that's actually profound
[1:43:11] that he says that doesn't matter and
[1:43:15] that doesn't matter what matters is this
[1:43:18] relationship
[1:43:20] [Music]
[1:43:23] praise God
[1:43:25] praise God thank you Lord
[1:43:28] because you see my thoughts go to

[1:43:37] have some special ability a special gift
[1:43:40] be handsome or strong or any of these
[1:43:42] things that would put some intrinsic
[1:43:44] value to me that he could say I could
[1:43:47] love him
[1:43:48] but I just come just as I am
[1:43:52] he said I love you
[1:43:54] I love you I pay a price for you I've
