[30:12] I that's fine if you can find I couldn't
[30:15] get the one of my ear to
[30:19] my God bless you can you hear
[30:22] okay all right I um sorry I came out a
[30:26] little late I he's checking on a mic for
[30:28] me I I couldn't use that ear mic that I
[30:31] couldn't find the one I normally use the
[30:33] lapel so I don't know where it's at but
[30:36] the year one I couldn't get fit of my
[30:37] ear so I just said
[30:40] okay we'll we'll do without it
[30:44] then so
[30:46] um I don't know what happened with the
[30:49] other one but not where it normally
[30:53] is so I I don't know if he found it or
[30:57] not but
[30:59] okay still looking okay well God bless
[31:03] you just want you to pray for me I'm a
[31:06] little bit nervous that of course that
[31:07] maybe a little more so you just uh pray
[31:11] for me I know that uh I know what's on
[31:15] my heart the message of the hour I don't
[31:18] mean just me I mean but what's
[31:20] ministered through the fivefold ministry
[31:23] today the true fivefold Ministry Satan
[31:25] hates
[31:26] it because it's it's the unveiling and
[31:29] the and the
[31:31] maturing of himself in Bride
[31:34] form and
[31:37] so that enemy doesn't like that because
[31:40] when you know your position and it's
[31:42] revealed to
[31:43] you and identified in you that little
[31:47] white
[31:49] stone inside of the
[31:52] inside you see what's been
[31:56] hidden and so
[31:58] nothing can move that once it's revealed
[32:00] in you there's not enough mistakes
[32:03] there's not enough failures there's not
[32:04] enough of anything can move that
[32:08] out of your life amen I don't know where
[32:12] Isaac went but we'll just continue
[32:15] here I'd like you to turn with me to St
[32:18] John I um so I'm not a little bit
[32:21] fumbling here with this
[32:23] so I haven't used one of these in a long
[32:26] time
[32:28] so I just uh pray that you'd I know you
[32:32] have prayed and God answers prayer his
[32:35] word will never return void right and so
[32:38] let's just have a word of prayer first
[32:41] our heavenly father it's so good to call
[32:44] you our father why because our father is
[32:48] revealed in us it's eternal life
[32:51] opened and father we know where we come
[32:54] from and we can call you our father
[32:58] Hallowed be thy name and Lord we thank
[33:01] you for this opportunity to express the
[33:05] truth in this hour Lord we know that
[33:08] that the
[33:09] truth Lord is is yourself made known
[33:15] revealed and Lord it's more than just a
[33:17] written word to
[33:19] us it's a revelation it's a it's a
[33:25] reality Lord what in that word has
[33:29] become opened and we know that this can
[33:32] only be open to your little bride and
[33:35] Lord we don't know who that is but
[33:37] individually we can know and Lord That's
[33:40] what Satan doesn't like it don't like
[33:42] that
[33:43] ministered and so Lord we just thank you
[33:46] that we have victory over him his power
[33:48] is broken his power can't stand and we
[33:52] just declare him defeated and and
[33:55] declare that though we're in a Warfare
[33:57] our enemies
[34:00] defeated and we know Lord that we got a
[34:02] very close enemy and this is this old
[34:05] carnal nature Paul talked about it and
[34:08] said oh Wicked Man or oh Wretched Man
[34:10] that I am who shall deliver me from the
[34:14] from the power of this but he said but
[34:16] through Jesus Christ I am
[34:18] freed and so it's a revelation of that
[34:21] Lord in us that has absolutely delivered
[34:24] us and freed us we're loose completely
[34:27] and we give you praise bless your word
[34:29] now we pray in thy name the Lord Jesus
[34:32] Christ amen amen St John chapter 1 verse
[34:38] one I want to you got it okay if you
[34:40] want to hook it up for me I'd rather I'd
[34:43] rather use
[34:45] that than than this because I just feel
[34:49] much more comfortable without
[34:52] this amen yeah so let's just hold off

[34:58] distract this

[36:42] feel more like I'm
[36:46] preacher no I'm just kidding that's not
[36:49] the preacher David's not the preacher
[36:51] anyway it's just a a
[36:53] vessel St John 1 verse one in the
[36:58] beginning was the
[37:01] word and the Word was with God and the
[37:05] Word was
[37:07] God the same was in the beginning with
[37:14] God and then verse 14 and the Word was
[37:18] made flesh and dwelt among us and we
[37:22] beheld his glory the glory as of the
[37:26] only begotten of the father full of
[37:29] grace and truth let me read that
[37:32] scripture again I'll take verse 13 with
[37:34] it let's take verse 12 with but as many
[37:37] as received him is there anybody here
[37:39] that way amen many has received him who
[37:42] is him the word what is that word in
[37:45] verse one up there that word is
[37:47] logos that
[37:49] logos is the thought or concept or the
[37:53] expression or utterance of that thought
[37:56] so we know word is a thought
[37:59] expressed and that's what I want to
[38:01] Major on is that
[38:03] logos because that's what's hidden in
[38:05] this Written
[38:07] Letter and that's what's
[38:11] revealed that's why I call this the word
[38:13] of
[38:15] life because the life the word of life
[38:18] life is eternal life we're speaking of
[38:20] and there's only one form of eternal
[38:22] life and that is God
[38:25] himself and so the word of life the
[38:28] which is then if the logos is the
[38:31] thought or concept or the thought
[38:35] expressed in a word then the The Word of
[38:40] Life the thought of God the word a
[38:44] thought
[38:45] expressed so what's the life the thought
[38:49] expressed in a word what's the word then
[38:52] that's the word of
[38:54] life amen life was expressed amen
[38:58] into a word and then the word was
[39:01] manifested in its season because the
[39:04] word is a
[39:07] seed is the seed right it's his seed yes
[39:12] because these thoughts that we speaking
[39:13] of he had he had all he knew all things
[39:16] but there are thoughts of himself that
[39:19] were to be expressed so let's read that
[39:22] verse let's read let's read let's start
[39:24] with verse one again in the beginning
[39:26] was the word
[39:29] and the Word was with
[39:31] God and the
[39:33] Word was
[39:35] God praise God I can hardly keep still
[39:39] now all right was God now verse he came
[39:43] verse 12 but as many as received him he
[39:46] came to his own that's his own creation
[39:49] and his own received him not
[39:51] but there were thoughts of him himself
[39:56] that could receive
[39:59] that would and did receive him in their
[40:01] in their
[40:03] time amen all right well now we're
[40:07] speaking of something when we speak of
[40:09] the logos now now we're going we're
[40:12] talking about I'm going to subject this
[40:14] of what was before the
[40:18] word what made it word what was before
[40:22] the word that now that is hid in the
[40:26] word
[40:29] amen all right so so the seals opened
[40:32] something that was in the back part of
[40:34] God's
[40:37] mind are you with me that had been held
[40:41] and could not be made known until this
[40:44] hour it wasn't something outside the
[40:47] word it's something in the word it was
[40:50] hidden the word and Satan couldn't know
[40:53] that cuz he would have done great damage
[40:55] cuz he's a perverter but but now it's
[40:57] too late because when these seals opened
[41:00] it opened the it opened the mystery of
[41:03] those seven
[41:05] Thunders amen and so that's what I want
[41:08] to speak of what was what was now in the
[41:11] word revealed from the word that's hid
[41:15] that was that was that was before the
[41:18] word we have the word
[41:21] here amen but what was before the word
[41:25] is something he expressed
[41:27] and it's right here this evening right
[41:29] Among Us
[41:32] amen and that word that thought
[41:35] expressed was
[41:37] God
[41:39] hallelujah my
[41:43] amen now let's let's so so as many as
[41:46] received him to them gave he power that
[41:49] power is authority to become the sons of
[41:52] God even to them that believe on his
[41:56] name
[41:58] which were born not of blood nor of the
[42:01] will of the flesh nor of the will of man
[42:05] but were born of
[42:09] God what is a new birth what is it it's
[42:12] the spoken word for the day the spoken
[42:15] word created creation a spoken word
[42:18] creation is a new birth is the new birth
[42:23] what is the new birth it's Jesus Christ
[42:25] revealed in you person
[42:29] personally all right
[42:32] so so which were born not of blood will
[42:35] of me but of God and and conjunction
[42:38] tying those scriptures with right here
[42:42] and all above and the Word was made
[42:47] flesh and dwelt among us and we beheld
[42:50] his
[42:51] glory I want just to come right down to
[42:54] the very day we're in right now where
[42:56] we're at right
[42:58] now and we beheld his glory as of the
[43:02] only begotten of the father what was the
[43:05] only
[43:07] begotten the birth word Jesus Christ was
[43:10] the only begotten of the father is that
[43:12] right then where did we come
[43:18] from you either were begotten of God or
[43:21] you're not begotten of God Amen so so
[43:25] the glory is of the only begotten of the
[43:27] father full of grace and truth amen you
[43:31] may be seated 2 Corinthians chapter
[43:35] 3 2 Corinthians
[43:41] 3 verse
[43:45] 2 well we'll take verse one with it do
[43:47] we begin to again to commend ourselves
[43:51] or need we as some other others Epistles
[43:55] or other words written word or letter
[43:57] of commendation to you or letters of
[44:00] commendation from
[44:02] you ye are our
[44:07] epistle written in our
[44:11] hearts notice where it's
[44:14] written it's a written word but where is
[44:16] it
[44:18] written written in our hearts known and
[44:21] read of all
[44:23] men amen known and read of all men they
[44:27] read it many read it many some can see
[44:32] it some can't but they read
[44:35] it all right brother brandom said you're
[44:38] a living
[44:39] Bible to the
[44:42] people and the prophet said the little
[44:44] bride today would be the Living Word
[44:47] right she would be the word living
[44:50] Hebrews 412 she would be living and
[44:52] operative the word is living and
[44:53] operative do you believe that the word
[44:56] is living and operative she would be the
[44:58] word living and in
[45:01] action operative living
[45:06] moving let me just go back I've spoken
[45:09] this this has become so open to me it
[45:11] just keeps opening the believer
[45:14] is the faith of
[45:18] God moving in
[45:23] them the believer is the faith we know
[45:26] what faith is faith is a
[45:30] revelation why because faith is
[45:33] revealed now Faith
[45:36] is what's revealed the
[45:39] substance of this
[45:41] word the substance of things hoped for
[45:45] what the promise gives you it becomes a
[45:47] revelation to you yes amen that's
[45:53] substance nothing can take that from you
[45:56] and not is it the substance of things
[45:58] hoped for which we're speaking of that
[46:00] substance tonight not only is because
[46:03] I'm talking about the
[46:06] logos in this word in this word
[46:12] yes this is a written this is a letter
[46:15] this is a written
[46:17] letter but but there's something hid in
[46:20] that
[46:21] letter that he wrote only to the bride
[46:27] what about when you receive it from him
[46:29] and it's revealed to you and and what is
[46:31] it going to do it's got to vindicate
[46:33] this word right what if it's revealed in
[46:35] you where does that place you in
[46:38] Heavenly places in
[46:40] Christ
[46:45] already all right let's just I went a
[46:47] little ahead of myself there let's back
[46:49] up you are our epistle written in our
[46:52] hearts known and read of all men for so
[46:55] much for so much as you are manifestly
[47:01] declared to be the Epistle of
[47:05] Christ the Epistle of
[47:08] Christ ministered by us now watch not
[47:13] written with
[47:15] ink not written with
[47:17] ink this is the word of God but we're
[47:20] talking about something that's hid
[47:23] here that's
[47:25] written amen not within
[47:29] think amen I believe this is the word of
[47:32] God written to us the Bible is I believe
[47:34] but I but I believe it holds and
[47:36] contains the
[47:39] revelation
[47:41] of or the thought
[47:43] of this
[47:47] word
[47:48] amen that's what it
[47:52] is because intellectually anyone can
[47:55] read the word and and quote it verbatim
[47:58] don't mean they know
[47:59] it and I believe in reading the
[48:03] word I believe in hearing the word
[48:05] hearing comes by faith comes by hearing
[48:07] the
[48:08] word amen that's why see you see why we
[48:12] needed a
[48:13] prophet because we now by a prophet's
[48:16] word for this end day he brought the
[48:19] revelation of the mystery that was
[48:21] contained in this scripture and without
[48:24] the Holy Ghost you wouldn't know what he
[48:26] said
[48:27] without the Holy Ghost dwelling in
[48:29] you you wouldn't know and without the
[48:33] without the ministry without the perfect
[48:35] interpretation of the word that we have
[48:37] today by Divine Vindication you wouldn't
[48:39] know what this word is
[48:44] speaking see how would you know then how
[48:47] to
[48:48] discern unless the Holy Spirit was in
[48:50] you that was
[48:52] spoken amen is that right all right so
[48:57] so we needed that Prophet we needed a
[48:59] prophet to come with the word because
[49:01] the word of the Lord what word of the
[49:03] Lord the logos came to the prophet yes
[49:06] and he revealed that word that thought
[49:08] of that word
[49:10] out amen why because by the hearing of
[49:13] the word faith Revelation in this word
[49:16] is known to you and I Amen to that
[49:20] bride amen so so he says so he says now
[49:27] but this ministry this this epistle that
[49:30] I'm that Christ declared to be the
[49:32] Epistle of Christ written ministered by
[49:36] us he said it's ministered by us Paul's
[49:39] speaking here it's ministered by
[49:41] US Written not with
[49:44] ink but with the spirit of the Living
[49:49] God not in tables of
[49:53] stone or in tables of paper
[49:59] he did Minister this you know this is
[50:02] written word what he spoke what he
[50:03] ministered was the word but it was the
[50:05] logos of the word that was
[50:10] ministered
[50:13] amen he spoke it it was ministered it
[50:16] was written
[50:18] somewhere it can be it can be written
[50:20] right here but if it remains right here
[50:22] and doesn't come a a reality in your
[50:25] life you don't see
[50:27] it God has to reveal it so he said it's
[50:31] not written ministered by us but not
[50:33] written with ink but by the spirit of
[50:36] the Living God not in tables of stone or
[50:38] or see this this Bible right here
[50:41] someday will
[50:44] burn but the word won't pass
[50:47] away the thought can't pass away because
[50:51] it's
[50:54] Eternal see so so not in tables of stone
[50:59] but in the tables but but it's written
[51:01] in the tables of the
[51:04] heart
[51:06] amen somebody's
[51:09] heart somebody in the heart has the seed
[51:12] of God to be quickened and when that's
[51:15] quickened the thought of God is revealed
[51:17] right
[51:19] my what manner of people ought we to be
[51:22] then
[51:24] yes okay so so because when those seals
[51:28] opened that opened the whole mystery the
[51:31] mystery of God is opened amen the third
[51:35] pull is the
[51:36] opening of that word that hidden word
[51:41] amen okay so not in tables of stone but
[51:44] in the fleshly tables of heart and such
[51:47] trust have we through Christ such trust
[51:50] to God
[51:53] word not that we are sufficient of
[51:56] ourselves see Paul came right back and
[51:57] told you this is not sufficiency of
[52:00] us we don't have the ability of the
[52:03] sufficiency of the man right see that we
[52:06] are sufficient of ourselves to think
[52:08] anything as of ourselves well that's a
[52:11] good
[52:14] one but our sufficiency is of God so it
[52:18] laid in God before the word before the
[52:21] beginning where was where was where was
[52:24] it as his thought
[52:27] it was in God it was in
[52:30] him it was dwelling in him where was it
[52:33] it was
[52:35] eternal who also hath made us able
[52:39] Ministers of the New Testament that's
[52:41] the New Covenant blood Covenant the life
[52:44] of that blood we are now able Ministers
[52:46] of the what the life of the
[52:48] blood the life of the
[52:55] word that may us able Ministers of the
[52:57] New Testament not of the
[53:00] letter but of the
[53:03] spirit for the letter kth but the spirit
[53:08] giveth
[53:09] life amen the spirit is giving
[53:13] life all right now we know that the
[53:16] seventh angel what type of message did
[53:18] he have do you notice his type of me
[53:21] message finishes finishing the mysteries
[53:24] of God that are written in the book
[53:26] that's what the Bible said finishes The
[53:28] Mystery of the written
[53:31] book then there was a mystery yet to be
[53:33] unveiled Paul spoke of it Paul spoke of
[53:37] it it was in the word but it was still
[53:40] hid he kept it
[53:42] hid until this hour John was forbidden
[53:46] to write it it was an Unwritten word in
[53:49] in the 10th chapter of Revelation not
[53:51] Unwritten in the scripture It Was
[53:52] Written there it was in there I mean it
[53:54] was hidden there but it was Unwritten
[53:58] yes but now it's being written
[54:01] where now it's being written in the
[54:04] heart of the Bride that's where it's
[54:05] being written and it's still
[54:10] hid amen it's still hid it's still a
[54:13] hidden
[54:14] word but it's open it's open now let me
[54:17] just show you what the prophet said I'm
[54:19] going to skip way ahead here just a
[54:22] minute now this is unveiling of God now
[54:25] it is isn't just a written word to us
[54:29] it's a reality isn't just a written word
[54:32] to us it's a reality he's talking about
[54:35] the written word we have here it's not
[54:37] just that now it is that but it's not
[54:40] just that what has happened is that
[54:42] what's in here between the lines that's
[54:45] why Satan hates that thought of reading
[54:47] between the lines because to the bride
[54:50] she has she because she was in his
[54:53] thought the thought of himself that he
[54:55] put in Word and when the prophet comes
[54:57] with the message of the hour to unveil
[54:59] that she can receive
[55:03] it amen there you are all right so so he
[55:08] said he said now it isn't just a written
[55:10] word now he's talking about now our day
[55:13] our time it's not just a written word to
[55:15] us it's a reality we are in
[55:19] him now we're enjoying now we Behold
[55:24] Him now we see
[55:27] him can you see Jesus absolutely you see
[55:31] him unveiled in you you see
[55:34] Jesus
[55:35] openly it's no longer hid to you it's
[55:39] open he's he's IM morphed himself into
[55:42] another
[55:43] mask he's kinos poured himself in to you
[55:47] and I we are becoming one for the
[55:50] celebration of that
[55:52] Union we're becoming one for the wedding
[55:55] supper
[55:58] amen and what are we we are the anointed
[56:00] word for the season amen we are himself
[56:06] revealed that's who we are that's the
[56:08] logos that's the thought that's what
[56:11] Satan see Satan Satan can and I don't
[56:14] say it's wrong to but Satan can tell you
[56:16] that word he did to Jesus when he
[56:18] tempted him he used the word verbatim
[56:20] it's
[56:21] written but what did Jesus come back
[56:24] with the logos but it's also
[56:29] written amen he re he was speaking the
[56:32] thought because he knew his position he
[56:34] knew where he was standing he spoke what
[56:37] he had and knew what he was in the word
[56:40] what about you and I
[56:44] bride you see you see where Satan where
[56:47] he where he cuts off is when the thought
[56:51] that revelation of that thought when the
[56:53] Revelation that's hid in the word here
[56:55] the thought the thought comes out now we
[56:57] have the word the life is being manifest
[56:59] the life of this word is a spoken word
[57:03] that's why our language is an is a new
[57:08] tongue right brother Paul it's a new
[57:11] tongue why because first John said he we
[57:14] are of God and they that know God hear
[57:19] us our speech isn't of the world they
[57:22] speak they of the world and the world
[57:24] hears them but they that are we are God
[57:26] so we are of God where' we come from we
[57:29] are of God yes then our speeches of
[57:33] himself the revelation of himself the
[57:35] revelation of the word the the original
[57:38] faith that was once delivered to the
[57:40] Saints was the Word of Promise for that
[57:42] hour and now we're we're restored to
[57:44] that original Faith what is it it's what
[57:47] the unwritten word was that was sealed
[57:49] up in it now we have what they had
[57:52] plus we have the full revelation of the
[57:55] word what is is it the restoring of the
[57:57] faith that was once delivered to the
[57:59] fathers what is it the faith the
[58:01] Revelation to see the hour and the day
[58:03] you're in and the promise of the
[58:07] day all those loose ends water baptism
[58:11] serpent seed all those things were he
[58:13] was he was he was unveiling that of the
[58:16] rock but then he took a sharp tool and
[58:18] opened that top of that rock and inside
[58:20] was a Unwritten word he said I must go
[58:23] west and get the revelation of that
[58:26] now looking on that I've got to get that
[58:28] Revelation because it would be that
[58:30] Revelation that would
[58:32] literally didn't he do two things didn't
[58:35] the seventh angel do two things one was
[58:38] to to fulfill and turn the heart and and
[58:41] reveal the mysteries of God Malachi 4
[58:45] number two was to reveal the secrets
[58:47] hidden in those Thunders that secret and
[58:50] he said it would be that Unwritten
[58:53] word that secret that rever revelation
[58:56] of that that's in the word but it was
[59:00] hid he said it would be that that would
[59:03] literally turn the hearts of the
[59:06] children to the faith of the
[59:11] fathers amen right back to the original
[59:14] Faith amen what is your original faith
[59:16] of course it's God's word revealed for
[59:18] the season the word for the season the
[59:20] hour and they without us couldn't be
[59:23] made perfect
[59:27] amen then we have the Revelation for
[59:29] this hour that's the original
[59:34] Faith it's the original Faith the
[59:37] original Revelation the original Faith
[59:39] we've been brought back back to
[59:41] Restoration just like he said we would
[59:44] be amen think of it that same faith is
[59:48] working living in the Earth
[59:51] today Hallelujah so he said now now we
[59:54] see him the word manifesting himself
[59:57] it's hid out there because why it's
[1:00:00] veiled in human flesh this Revelation
[1:00:03] this is a this is veiled in human flesh
[1:00:07] your
[1:00:10] flesh My Flesh your flesh it's a veil
[1:00:14] that hides
[1:00:15] it but it's
[1:00:18] unveiled where what is that the Bible
[1:00:21] said and I'll I'll just kind of Jump
[1:00:23] Ahead a little bit he said the as a man
[1:00:26] thinketh in his
[1:00:28] heart so is he now brother brandham said
[1:00:32] there's no mental human mental faculty
[1:00:35] in the heart but he said he's not
[1:00:37] talking about the human mental faculty
[1:00:39] the conception of the mind he's talking
[1:00:41] about the supernatural mind the
[1:00:44] supernatural being that's unveiled the
[1:00:46] Supernatural That's unveiled that mind
[1:00:49] amen as a man thinketh in his heart so
[1:00:52] is he
[1:00:56] if you want to know where he said that
[1:00:57] I've got it all right now so we see him
[1:01:03] the word manifest himself manifesting
[1:01:06] himself we see we're inside of Christ
[1:01:10] now as then as then we're inside of
[1:01:15] Christ
[1:01:17] amen we are in him it's revealed to the
[1:01:20] individual
[1:01:23] amen what's what's revealed what's
[1:01:26] how can we Behold Him what's revealed as
[1:01:29] we said those seven Thunders are
[1:01:32] unveiled what that what the secret is
[1:01:35] what were those seven Thunders the
[1:01:36] Revelation contained in the
[1:01:38] seals it's a
[1:01:40] message all right that's the
[1:01:43] message that's the message of the
[1:01:46] seventh angel that's what would
[1:01:48] literally that's that message that would
[1:01:50] literally turn the heart of the children
[1:01:53] to the faith of those original fathers
[1:01:57] now here we are we've arrived what are
[1:02:00] we doing we're we're growing under

[1:10:14] it's his thought
[1:10:16] expressed in order for that thought to
[1:10:19] become creation it was expressed in a
[1:10:21] word then the word was manifested
[1:10:26] when in its
[1:10:27] season this is the
[1:10:32] season you hear Brother Braham say the
[1:10:34] word on the day of Pentecost won't work
[1:10:37] today that so what's he
[1:10:40] saying we believe what Pentecost brought
[1:10:44] but he said the word for on the day of
[1:10:46] Pentecost won't work other words we have
[1:10:48] more than what they saw it was hidden
[1:10:50] now we've got it so what's the original
[1:10:52] Faith the original faith is the word for
[1:10:55] the season revealed to you just like the
[1:10:58] word for the season was revealed to them
[1:11:00] only we have a word for our
[1:11:03] season that they didn't know
[1:11:06] this but they had the faith for their
[1:11:13] season the word for the season is what
[1:11:16] identifies the bride revealed to her
[1:11:20] alone it's their season that's the
[1:11:23] original Faith it's always been that
[1:11:25] original
[1:11:28] Faith amen what's what's happening today
[1:11:32] we have the
[1:11:33] Capstone capping off what's it doing not
[1:11:37] only capping off the body copying off
[1:11:39] his word capping it off but he's capping
[1:11:41] every individual every pyramid the
[1:11:44] Pyramid of your life what is the Pyramid
[1:11:46] of your life it's that stature of
[1:11:49] himself a perfect
[1:11:51] man he comes and caps that off what's
[1:11:55] the message of the hour the capping of
[1:11:57] it
[1:11:57] off then we lay under this message and
[1:12:00] it's got to come to that capping what is
[1:12:02] that capping a perfect love operating a
[1:12:05] perfect faith in a perfect word that you
[1:12:09] are that's why it was opened
[1:12:13] amen that's why it's
[1:12:19] revealed Hallelujah all right now he
[1:12:22] said God stands openly the veil is rent
[1:12:26] that's the word see God's openly the
[1:12:28] veil is rent God stands openly before
[1:12:35] you manifest it manifest it openly
[1:12:39] before you manifest it see God man you
[1:12:41] say oh that was the prophet no that's
[1:12:43] you if that prophet's message didn't go
[1:12:45] anywhere if it didn't come into the
[1:12:47] heart of the Bride there's something
[1:12:48] wrong because under our messenger we
[1:12:50] become that
[1:12:52] voice that's another language brother
[1:12:54] Paul we become that voice what is the
[1:12:57] voice of the Word of Promise for the
[1:13:00] hour the open word the seventh seal is
[1:13:03] unveiled to you

[1:13:15] a royal seed it would be a royal bride
[1:13:18] and the promises in the scriptures

[1:13:22] Revelations 10 another promise where is
[1:13:24] it where is it happening yes this day
[1:13:28] the scripture is fulfilled I'm saying
[1:13:30] tonight this day the scripture is
[1:13:33] fulfilled that's when Peter stood up the
[1:13:35] day at Pentecost and preached the
[1:13:36] message this day the scripture is
[1:13:38] fulfilled I sold that from Brother
[1:13:41] Chad
[1:13:44] anyway but I like it because that's what
[1:13:47] he preached he preached this day he went
[1:13:51] back to Joel picked up the scriptures
[1:13:53] and said this day what you read in the
[1:13:55] word the thought in that word is
[1:14:01] revealed that thought that low goost is
[1:14:03] revealed it's open am to someone and
[1:14:06] that
[1:14:09] someone was in his thought it was the
[1:14:11] thought of himself for that day and
[1:14:14] season now what's our day in
[1:14:18] season where's the faith
[1:14:26] amen then you become see you were his
[1:14:32] thought the word the what is excuse
[1:14:36] me see God manifested open manifested
[1:14:40] open you were his
[1:14:44] thought now we could go back to the
[1:14:46] church age book and pick it out the
[1:14:47] thoughts were real and existence see the
[1:14:50] Eternal thoughts of God are the thoughts
[1:14:52] of God Eternal yes they're Eternal what
[1:14:55] made the difference between Jacob and
[1:14:56] Esau Jacob was the seed Jacob was the
[1:14:59] brother Bram said Jacob was the
[1:15:03] thought amen it was the thought of God
[1:15:06] that made the
[1:15:08] difference and that thought when it's
[1:15:10] expressed as comes a seed and you plant
[1:15:13] the seed in It season and it's got to
[1:15:15] reproduce itself Glory bride do you see
[1:15:19] what you are it's
[1:15:21] open it's openly manifested
[1:15:28] hallelujah it's outside of your realm of
[1:15:30] thinking it's outside of your carnal
[1:15:33] mind it's outside of that it's not in
[1:15:37] that it's a supernatural element of the
[1:15:40] inside of the inside of the inward man
[1:15:42] that happens to be the Living Word
[1:15:44] himself manifested through flesh
[1:15:46] ordering directing guiding quickening
[1:15:49] your mortal body and bringing it subject
[1:15:51] to that wordl
[1:15:55] you don't have to make that work that up
[1:15:57] and pump that up you don't have to do
[1:15:58] anything about it you just need to feed
[1:16:00] and ask God to reveal himself without a
[1:16:03] spiritual Revelation it won't be no good
[1:16:05] it takes that spiritual revealing of
[1:16:08] that thought that was in God and I
[1:16:11] always said when you know where you come
[1:16:12] from you know where you're going if you
[1:16:14] know where you're going you know who you
[1:16:16] are and if you know where you come from
[1:16:18] you know who you are then you know where
[1:16:20] you're
[1:16:23] going there's no question about it it's
[1:16:25] unveiled I'm identified I can speak as
[1:16:28] an individual because it's only
[1:16:29] individuals it's not this group that
[1:16:32] group another group it's
[1:16:33] individuals that catch the Revelation
[1:16:37] that stone was the elect Stone it's an
[1:16:39] individual it's
[1:16:42] white but it's what's in the stone that
[1:16:44] made the difference it's what's in the
[1:16:47] stone it's what's revealed to the
[1:16:50] bride that's his name that's his name
[1:16:53] that's his life
[1:16:56] what are you bringing forth the promised
[1:16:58] son you've now received enough faith and
[1:17:01] have faith to be to conceive and we've
[1:17:03] conceived there's a bride
[1:17:07] conceiving
[1:17:08] my I wish I had
[1:17:11] time it's not enough time in one sermon
[1:17:14] what time is it yeah I have just a
[1:17:16] little time here
[1:17:18] okay I can't I can't bring everything
[1:17:20] here but it's but I've got to hit some
[1:17:22] places okay now
[1:17:25] when he present it to you as a thought
[1:17:28] his before a word it's a thought before
[1:17:30] a word it's a
[1:17:36] thought
[1:17:39] amen and the thought has to be
[1:17:42] created you see those thoughts were real
[1:17:45] in God's mind it was what was it in him
[1:17:48] it was it was revealed to him it was
[1:17:50] Revelation he he had to just speak the
[1:17:53] thought he had to speak the
[1:17:56] Revelation now I'm coming to something
[1:17:58] here and we'll end with that all right
[1:18:02] now that's what he said so he presents
[1:18:05] it now before a word it's a
[1:18:11] thought I'm going to back up on that
[1:18:13] just a little bit I want to cut
[1:18:14] something before I get to that point now
[1:18:16] I'm bypassing a lot in the church age
[1:18:18] book and you understand because of time
[1:18:20] and maybe I'll pick it up again here in
[1:18:23] another in the next sermon or something
[1:18:25] but but in in on if you want to write
[1:18:28] these down page 166 paragraph 173
[1:18:31] through
[1:18:32] 174 and then read from paragraph 163
[1:18:35] paragraph 163 is
[1:18:38] amazing because the God's heart purpose
[1:18:40] his eternal purpose what was God's
[1:18:43] Eternal purpose right was to have a
[1:18:48] bride was to have a
[1:18:51] bride that was his heart purpose that
[1:18:54] was his eternal
[1:18:57] purpose and the only way he could get
[1:18:59] her was to unveil himself completely at
[1:19:03] the end and that would produce faith for
[1:19:06] a body
[1:19:09] change brother Ram said what we had
[1:19:12] wouldn't have worked until those seals
[1:19:16] opened amen you see how important these
[1:19:19] seals
[1:19:20] are there lays the message there lays
[1:19:24] the Faith your faith I say your faith
[1:19:27] what is the victory our faith what is
[1:19:29] our faith if you're a True Believer
[1:19:31] filled with the Holy Ghost identified in
[1:19:33] him what is the our faith the
[1:19:37] victory what is our faith God is our
[1:19:43] faith God is my Revelation Psalm 62 said
[1:19:46] God is my rock my
[1:19:48] Revelation amen nobody's standing up
[1:19:51] here boasting brother sister I'm not
[1:19:53] exalting this human body this flesh I
[1:19:56] dwell I I am that unveiled word on the
[1:19:59] inside the inside but I have a twin
[1:20:01] that's real close to me that's right but
[1:20:04] I'll have you know the Bible said that
[1:20:06] the Elder would serve the
[1:20:12] younger amen is that so I happen to be
[1:20:16] that new creation there predestinated by
[1:20:19] God the thought of God and was expressed
[1:20:21] in a message today and I've come alive
[1:20:24] under that
[1:20:25] why identifying that I'm his thought I'm
[1:20:30] himself revealed in this
[1:20:34] hour
[1:20:37] amen you see that's the
[1:20:42] younger the first one was was the man
[1:20:45] part this old man this old Wretched Man
[1:20:47] that I am as we said see Paul said who's
[1:20:49] going to deliver me from it but thank
[1:20:51] God through the revelation of Jesus
[1:20:52] Christ in me I am delivered of of
[1:20:55] it I don't care what it does how it does
[1:20:58] what it does what it says it's not
[1:21:01] me amen I bring that under obedience to
[1:21:05] the word that is
[1:21:08] me the word is
[1:21:12] me we die every day Bible said that that
[1:21:15] the Bible said that we die
[1:21:17] daily the scripture said we bear in our
[1:21:20] body the dying of the Lord Jesus what
[1:21:22] for so that the life also of Jesus may
[1:21:25] be man manifest in our mortal body what
[1:21:28] is it the Word of
[1:21:30] Life what is it the thought there that I
[1:21:32] am that I had that I receive the
[1:21:35] Revelation the truth the word now
[1:21:37] becomes
[1:21:41] living see you can't argue brother
[1:21:44] sister a religious person an
[1:21:46] intellectual religious person why
[1:21:48] goodness sake they out quote the word
[1:21:50] any day to you put a wrong
[1:21:52] interpretation whatever they got their
[1:21:53] relig they can be they can be 99 98% 99%
[1:21:58] true but they leave off one little thing
[1:22:00] and what is it a
[1:22:01] lie right what did Satan deceive e by a
[1:22:06] lie it's a lie not truth where's the
[1:22:11] truth where is where is it what defeated
[1:22:13] the devil just just Jesus quoting
[1:22:16] scripture back no he was testifying of
[1:22:19] who he is who he was and where he come
[1:22:21] from and he said Thou shalt Worship the
[1:22:23] Lord God and him only only shall you
[1:22:25] serve what was it the logos the thought
[1:22:28] in the word what are we here to Pro to
[1:22:30] proclaim the thought in the word the
[1:22:33] thought in God I act like a drunk man
[1:22:36] forgive
[1:22:38] me I guess I am CU this is more real to
[1:22:42] me than he's standing up
[1:22:44] here what is it it's it's got to be
[1:22:47] somebody I know they may be few but just
[1:22:49] stand just stand where he placed
[1:22:52] you you're seated now in heaven places
[1:22:55] Satan can't get to you if he tried if he
[1:22:57] tried to get to that place he'd have to
[1:22:59] come through the blood oh he can meet up
[1:23:00] there but he can't take that
[1:23:03] position and he knows that position is
[1:23:06] God himself the very creator of heavens
[1:23:08] and earth in the bride form in that

[1:24:45] here the end is here did you know
[1:24:50] that then what was to be unveiled in the
[1:24:52] end what would denote the end what would
[1:24:55] what would be the the the sign of the
[1:24:58] end these Seven Seals are opened the
[1:25:01] mystery of those suers is
[1:25:04] revealed not a mystery to her she sees
[1:25:07] it amen and she's growing into it amen
[1:25:11] developing into it yes what is what
[1:25:14] himself she's his she is his eternal
[1:25:17] possession she is his kingdom she's the
[1:25:20] word living manifested in your life in
[1:25:24] flesh
[1:25:29] amen
[1:25:31] now well Brother David he's gone off the
[1:25:33] deep end yes let me alone I like this
[1:25:36] deep end I can swim
[1:25:38] anyway all
[1:25:40] right I don't have to tiptoe along the
[1:25:45] bottom I can
[1:25:48] swim was made for me amen I'm free yes I
[1:25:54] got the that whole expans to swi in
[1:25:59] now all
[1:26:04] right so it's a previously hidden truth
[1:26:07] now divinely
[1:26:08] revealed but which is there is a super
[1:26:12] but which there's a supernatural element
[1:26:14] Still Remains despite the
[1:26:16] Revelation oh God sent a prophet yes sir
[1:26:19] he revealed what is
[1:26:21] it it's so simple you and your carnal
[1:26:25] mind wouldn't even be able to touch
[1:26:29] it you can't get simple enough you as a
[1:26:32] man a woman cannot get simple enough to
[1:26:35] see this simple Revelation it's so
[1:26:40] simple so what makes the difference it's
[1:26:43] revealed
[1:26:46] amen because God becomes so simple it
[1:26:49] goes beyond our human carnal Simplicity
[1:26:53] of what we call
[1:26:57] simple amen I'm telling you you just get
[1:27:01] into it and see you see he said it in
[1:27:03] such a way it would stumble some cause
[1:27:05] some to ponder and separate and thin
[1:27:08] down his
[1:27:09] crowd but the bride because she was his
[1:27:13] thought and that thought was expressed
[1:27:15] she's going to see
[1:27:17] it
[1:27:19] supernaturally because she's got to see
[1:27:21] it individually she'll have the
[1:27:23] revelation of the
[1:27:27] Revelation because that Supernatural
[1:27:29] element is what you receive in your soul
[1:27:32] that's what's divinely revealed to you
[1:27:37] personally because it's been
[1:27:44] revealed amen it's got a line doesn't it
[1:27:47] and only she can know if it aligns or
[1:27:49] doesn't align because she is in the
[1:27:52] author of it amen she is in
[1:27:57] him so what is this hour what is this
[1:27:59] time it's
[1:28:01] him in action it's
[1:28:03] him
[1:28:06] manifested it's all his
[1:28:10] achieving
[1:28:13] now it's a revelation to you an in to
[1:28:16] you as an individual of the Revelation
[1:28:18] or the message of the seventh angel
[1:28:20] revealed in you the revelation of the
[1:28:22] revelation
[1:28:24] then we come to Jesus the logos who is
[1:28:27] Jesus the logos the
[1:28:30] thought
[1:28:32] expressed manifested in
[1:28:36] flesh what about our day is he still the
[1:28:40] same where is
[1:28:44] he well I haven't see the calvary man
[1:28:46] you're just stuck on the man where is he
[1:28:49] where's the opened word where is the
[1:28:51] revealing of the word
[1:28:54] oh to that old that
[1:28:57] old Wretched Man over there that no
[1:29:01] Beauty we desire
[1:29:05] him well be
[1:29:08] careful because there he is
[1:29:11] hid and in fact he makes it so
[1:29:14] ridiculous you'd turn away from it
[1:29:15] unless that life was in there to hear
[1:29:17] the
[1:29:18] voice because what the bride's
[1:29:20] ministering she has a great message she
[1:29:23] has the ministry she has a Ministry she
[1:29:25] has a great ministry brother Bram said
[1:29:26] it's the message of the ministry of the
[1:29:29] hour so what's she
[1:29:31] ministering the
[1:29:35] faith and who's going to hear
[1:29:38] it those that are of
[1:29:42] God the only ones that can so what are
[1:29:44] we going to
[1:29:46] do get all upset because the majority
[1:29:50] aren't right I'm not talking about just
[1:29:53] the church I'm talking about majority
[1:29:54] aren't because I reason I said that
[1:29:56] because the bride's a
[1:29:57] minority we going to get upset because
[1:29:59] the majority don't or we just going to
[1:30:01] keep preaching to the ones that
[1:30:04] can there's got to be somebody can we're
[1:30:07] not responsible for those that can't
[1:30:10] we're not responsible even how they
[1:30:11] receive it we're responsible to bring
[1:30:13] the Revelation for the season and the
[1:30:15] hour because this ministry of this bride
[1:30:18] is consisting of a fivefold
[1:30:20] Ministry Apostles prophets teachers
[1:30:23] pastors evangelists what are they
[1:30:24] preaching the revelation of the
[1:30:28] hour you try to preach another hour
[1:30:31] another time you're out of position he
[1:30:33] said don't misplace it don't
[1:30:35] misinterpret it
[1:30:38] right that
[1:30:41] right so what's it going to take
[1:30:43] Revelation leave it alone you ask God
[1:30:46] for Revelation when God reveals it go
[1:30:51] forward just walk in the light he's
[1:30:54] given you that's all he's requiring
[1:30:57] don't add to it don't put your opinion
[1:30:59] on it don't look at the Affairs and how
[1:31:01] people react to it because then man
[1:31:04] becomes your your stabilizer man becomes
[1:31:07] your confidence instead of God the word
[1:31:09] becomes your confidence you're looking
[1:31:11] at what they do instead of looking what
[1:31:13] he
[1:31:14] wants that little man that played that
[1:31:17] violin and everybody stood up and
[1:31:18] Applause and sat out and stood up again
[1:31:19] and Applause he didn't seem to be moved
[1:31:22] by that he had his eyes on one person
[1:31:26] yes his
[1:31:29] master what does he think about
[1:31:32] it is it pleasing to him there's only
[1:31:36] one thing that'll please
[1:31:40] God
[1:31:42] faith his
[1:31:45] faith that's right his faith you know
[1:31:47] there's a power in in in intellectual
[1:31:49] Faith you know that but his faith but
[1:31:52] that will never put you in a body ch
[1:31:57] so it has to be the word revealed in
[1:32:03] you amen am there's no other way around
[1:32:06] it you can have all the religion you
[1:32:08] want to make out of this message and the
[1:32:10] message become religion to many
[1:32:12] people but this message is not a book of
[1:32:14] rules and regulation it's not religion
[1:32:17] it absolutely is God himself the word
[1:32:19] manifested in flesh
[1:32:26] seeing receiving openly
[1:32:29] seeing the word for the
[1:32:31] season and living it and walking it and
[1:32:35] they think what kind of person is see
[1:32:37] Revelation always stumbles the carnal
[1:32:41] mind they don't get it they don't see it
[1:32:44] see but that doesn't my concern or yours
[1:32:47] just live it God will live it you don't
[1:32:50] have to make it pump it up and try to
[1:32:52] live it
[1:32:55] if you're trying to live it if you're
[1:32:57] trying to please and trying to live it
[1:32:58] trying to do Works to get into it
[1:33:00] thinking that's going to do it it won't
[1:33:02] do it a bit won't do it that's not what
[1:33:03] the bride's made up of she is his
[1:33:07] thought she is his faith she is the
[1:33:13] word made manifest
[1:33:17] am not for another season this season
[1:33:20] she's the one that catches it all right
[1:33:22] I've got to close
[1:33:25] now so he was the logos Jesus was the
[1:33:29] perfect and complete thought expressed
[1:33:32] and he became known as the word then
[1:33:35] what then is that is what he is and
[1:33:39] forever will be other words he still is
[1:33:42] now it says that he ha chosen that he
[1:33:44] hath chosen Us in him Jesus said he we
[1:33:48] were chosen in him now where's the logos
[1:33:54] see before the foundation of the world
[1:33:57] that means that we were right there with
[1:33:59] him in the mind and thoughts of God
[1:34:02] before the foundation of the world what
[1:34:05] were the thoughts of God Eternal
[1:34:07] thoughts that was God himself the
[1:34:09] thoughts of
[1:34:11] himself you're that Eternal
[1:34:14] thought you are that thought manifest
[1:34:16] you are it gives you an eternal quality
[1:34:19] that quality is a distinctive attribute
[1:34:21] it's a distinctive characteristic it's
[1:34:23] it's a distinctive characteristic
[1:34:26] possessed by you it's a it's a it's a
[1:34:29] feature it's a trait it's an attribute
[1:34:30] it's a characteristic it's a Mark it's a
[1:34:32] stamp it's life it's seal it's Faith
[1:34:36] it's his
[1:34:38] faith that's that
[1:34:41] quality amen all right Philippians 2 as
[1:34:45] I said let this mind be in
[1:34:47] you so see you were right with him in
[1:34:49] the mind and thoughts of God that gives
[1:34:51] an eternal quality to the elect you
[1:34:54] can't get away from that no we can't now
[1:34:57] in the beginning was the word that was
[1:34:58] God and the Word was God that's right
[1:35:00] and this same word was made flesh and
[1:35:02] dwelt among us and then God was made
[1:35:04] flesh that without controversy that's
[1:35:06] true God was made flesh why people say
[1:35:08] yes praise the Lord that's that's right
[1:35:09] he was made flesh no wait a minute he
[1:35:13] can't be the same
[1:35:15] today he's still made
[1:35:18] flesh and his name is still Jesus in
[1:35:20] fact it's Mrs Jesus
[1:35:24] yeah yeah it's his name he was to be
[1:35:26] bride he had a thought to be bride he
[1:35:28] wanted to be bride that was his
[1:35:30] objective that was his that was his
[1:35:32] heart purpose that to have a bride of
[1:35:34] his own choosing that was his eternal
[1:35:36] purpose can you understand you were his
[1:35:39] eternal
[1:35:41] purpose talk about A Love
[1:35:44] Affair what will that love do always
[1:35:46] point back to the word always point back
[1:35:48] to the word always back to what the word
[1:35:53] the thought in this word it'll always
[1:35:55] point back and say here it is here it is
[1:35:58] well yeah that's a scripture I know that
[1:35:59] one yeah but you don't go the thought of
[1:36:01] it when that thought's revealed to you
[1:36:05] that's different how many knows that
[1:36:07] thought's revealed then a deeper
[1:36:08] thought's revealed then we call it
[1:36:10] deeper it's deeper it's just more simple
[1:36:11] all the time it just keep it's coming to
[1:36:13] one specific position that's
[1:36:18] him he wanted to be
[1:36:21] you he determined to be you you his
[1:36:24] thought of you it was his thought of you
[1:36:26] he wanted to be bride he said I'm going
[1:36:28] to have a bride and that'll be me and
[1:36:30] I'll even prepare the ground and that's
[1:36:32] my making Amen to receive it so he's the
[1:36:36] ground and he's and he's the life
[1:36:40] yes so we worship Him in spirit and in
[1:36:44] truth
[1:36:45] amen without you're not the you're not
[1:36:48] here to you're not here to to preach
[1:36:51] just letter you're here to preach
[1:36:53] reality
[1:36:55] we use a letter certainly do because we
[1:36:57] have a prophet that took us back to this
[1:36:59] word showed us what was there but don't
[1:37:02] add to that interpretation and don't
[1:37:04] take away from
[1:37:07] it many of man are putting their own
[1:37:09] thought to brother Brown just didn't
[1:37:10] mean that that scripture means something
[1:37:12] different why my theology teaches me
[1:37:15] better than that oh really your theology
[1:37:17] will only take you back to the beginning
[1:37:20] beyond that you can't enter that the
[1:37:21] that theology won't enter
[1:37:24] cuz now we're going back into the very
[1:37:26] Mind Of God which was expressed in the
[1:37:29] word that's you that's him and that's
[1:37:33] you that catches that Revelation right
[1:37:36] there you can't I'll just pick it up no
[1:37:39] you don't pick it up you feed on
[1:37:42] it and you quit worrying about whether
[1:37:45] you're going to get it or what you're
[1:37:46] going to do you just give your all I'm
[1:37:47] going to come to a quote real quick I
[1:37:49] got to just to quit now all right all
[1:37:51] right so now before before this was word
[1:37:56] what is a word a a word is a manifested
[1:37:58] thought okay we got that now in the
[1:38:01] beginning that's it was a word that's as
[1:38:03] far as they can go by theology but
[1:38:05] before the word was it was a thought and
[1:38:09] that thought was made manifest now I'm
[1:38:11] quoting right from that that message you
[1:38:13] took on Sunday that leaped at me there's
[1:38:16] a paragraph there that I just could not
[1:38:18] run from I'm not here to preach your
[1:38:19] message brother Paul I'm just here to
[1:38:21] express it in the way that God want me
[1:38:23] to minister it amen that's all he's
[1:38:25] going to minister it through you it all
[1:38:27] Blends right together absolutely
[1:38:29] absolutely we're talking about eternal
[1:38:31] do you realize that time is eternity
[1:38:35] space you ever hear a prophet say you
[1:38:37] that time is a little
[1:38:40] hickey eternity continues on but time
[1:38:43] dropped down eternity dropped down into
[1:38:45] a time space and brother bam said all
[1:38:48] time is is eternity's
[1:38:52] space and you go right back into
[1:38:54] eternity again right and continues on so
[1:38:58] what was that thought in you what's that
[1:39:00] thought revealed what's the thought of
[1:39:01] God it's the thought of God what is that
[1:39:03] Eternal it's the Eternal
[1:39:06] Word it's the word of
[1:39:11] life amen so before the word it was a
[1:39:16] thought and a thought was manifest you
[1:39:17] see what I mean first it was the thought
[1:39:19] and he spoke the word and the Word was
[1:39:21] manifest oh how infallible God is
[1:39:24] God's mind the mind that was in the
[1:39:26] beginning was brought was a thought
[1:39:28] before it was a word that expressed
[1:39:31] Jesus Christ the same one was expressing
[1:39:33] that word right back again because he
[1:39:35] said let the tree talk fig tree don't
[1:39:37] man eat of you anymore see what was it
[1:39:40] it was God's mind expressed and every
[1:39:43] word in the Bible is God's thoughts laid
[1:39:45] in seed form every word in the Bible is
[1:39:48] God's thoughts laid in seed form that if
[1:39:52] received into the human being and spoke
[1:39:54] by the same thought that materialized
[1:39:57] the Bible brings the thing to pass see
[1:39:59] what I mean how powerful could the
[1:40:00] church be the Bible said let the mind
[1:40:03] that was in Christ be in you as a man
[1:40:06] thinketh in his heart so is
[1:40:09] he see and brother Brown said he was
[1:40:11] speaking of the supernatural
[1:40:15] being all right now now that if that
[1:40:19] same Spirit now remember we have the
[1:40:21] same Spirit of Faith 2 Corinthians 4:13
[1:40:23] Paul said we having the same Spirit of
[1:40:27] Faith now if that same spirit that said
[1:40:30] let there be light and there was light
[1:40:32] he said let there be trees there was
[1:40:33] trees he said if that same mind that was
[1:40:35] in Christ be in you how much could it
[1:40:38] say if that same mind was in Christ as
[1:40:41] in you how much could it
[1:40:44] say let there be no cancer and it would
[1:40:47] be gone let there be blind eyes be
[1:40:49] opened and it would be so see it's your
[1:40:52] thought
[1:40:53] verily Jesus said verily verily he said
[1:40:56] first in Mark
[1:40:57] 11:22 have faith in God you know what
[1:41:00] the translation of that is brother
[1:41:02] brandham even told us he said have faith
[1:41:05] have the faith of
[1:41:07] God Mark 11:22 have the faith of God for
[1:41:11] verily I say unto you if you shall say
[1:41:12] to this mountain be moved plucked up and
[1:41:14] cast into the sea and don't doubt in
[1:41:17] your heart don't doubt in your heart not
[1:41:20] in your mind out here your flesh man but
[1:41:22] don't doubt in your
[1:41:24] heart are you with me it's going to
[1:41:27] bring this mind under obedience but
[1:41:29] don't doubt there can't be doubt in the
[1:41:30] heart because when you speak his thought
[1:41:32] it had to come from the heart other
[1:41:34] words it's just a mental conception if
[1:41:37] it's not a divine revelation it's not
[1:41:40] his
[1:41:41] word you see what the difference is so
[1:41:44] many just speak their mental
[1:41:47] conception but when you speak Revelation
[1:41:50] that's different when you speak his
[1:41:52] thought when you speak his
[1:41:56] mind okay
[1:41:59] now all right all
[1:42:05] right okay you can have what you say now
[1:42:08] Romans 108
[1:42:10] said that the word is nigh thee even in
[1:42:13] thy mouth the word of
[1:42:15] what the word of
[1:42:19] faith amen what's your confession the
[1:42:22] word of
[1:42:24] Faith all right now as you say Brother
[1:42:27] David you say how well I want to make it
[1:42:30] happen I got to have it right now no God
[1:42:31] wants you to
[1:42:33] wait you can me give it a right mental
[1:42:36] attitude you follow what I'm
[1:42:38] saying God will reveal
[1:42:41] it you just go on holding on but when
[1:42:43] God reveals it that's settled that's
[1:42:45] finished right there then speak that it
[1:42:48] can no more pass away than his word it
[1:42:49] never will pass away why because God
[1:42:52] that thought of God has become a direct
[1:42:54] Revelation to you now I you want to hear
[1:42:58] what he said about that I'll close with
[1:43:00] this now you can you can express it by
[1:43:03] mental
[1:43:04] conception but if it becomes a real
[1:43:07] revelation of God that you see it before
[1:43:09] it
[1:43:11] happened what is it
[1:43:15] substance you see it before it happened
[1:43:17] and express it in word form that word
[1:43:20] takes a hold and becomes material
[1:43:24] there it is right there there is the
[1:43:27] Walk of the people of God that's God's
[1:43:29] walk right
[1:43:31] there okay that's how that's how that's
[1:43:34] how Enoch
[1:43:37] walked oh my how God could if your heart
[1:43:40] and your mind is so infilled with God's
[1:43:42] spirit until your thoughts become his
[1:43:44] thoughts amen there you are when your
[1:43:46] mind and your leading and your guiding
[1:43:48] becomes a direct place or direct
[1:43:50] inspiration of the Holy Spirit that's
[1:43:52] moving in your mortal being oh my what
[1:43:55] kind of people should we be if the very
[1:43:58] Holy Spirit has you so embodied ower
[1:44:01] that you don't use your own thoughts you
[1:44:03] don't use your own mind you don't use
[1:44:05] your own opinion but the Holy Spirit has
[1:44:08] you so built until your thoughts and
[1:44:10] your being is God's spirit expressing
[1:44:12] itself through you what kind of a church
[1:44:15] would we be yes how's that church made
[1:44:19] up see see what we've got to do what the
[1:44:22] bride's doing is going it's gone from
[1:44:24] church to bride he said I won't call you
[1:44:27] church anymore I'll call you bride so
[1:44:29] she's got to you've got to go from
[1:44:30] church to bride you've got to turn the
[1:44:35] corner because who's he dealing with now
[1:44:38] he's dealing with the bride that's come
[1:44:39] out of that
[1:44:41] church amen it's no more church it's
[1:44:44] bride it's a bride age he said it's a
[1:44:47] bride time it's seed time it's bride
[1:44:51] time it's virgin word
[1:44:54] time amen all right I'm
[1:44:57] closing
[1:45:00] now then when the human element goes out
[1:45:03] you don't use your own thoughts you have
[1:45:05] no alternative of your
[1:45:06] own just led by the spirit and that and
[1:45:10] and they that are sons of God are led by
[1:45:12] the spirit of God then let him lead see
[1:45:15] but when the human element goes out and
[1:45:17] the spirit of God fills that vacancy
[1:45:20] where you empty yourself I mind that
[1:45:22] just spoke to me so impact where you
[1:45:26] empty
[1:45:28] yourself where you aren't the one
[1:45:30] projecting your the man out here you're
[1:45:32] not projecting that amen then will be
[1:45:37] when the church in its power of the
[1:45:39] resurrection of the Lord Jesus will walk
[1:45:41] in his steps in his power in his
[1:45:44] thoughts in his being in his moving you
[1:45:46] see what see what's he doing in this
[1:45:48] message prophesying right of what would
[1:45:51] take place of what we are having having
[1:45:53] and enjoying now and what the seals
[1:45:56] would open he said it's moving and it's
[1:45:58] got to come to that spot
[1:46:03] amen amen you see we've had the sign of
[1:46:07] the
[1:46:08] Union a spiritual sign of that Union
[1:46:11] taking place
[1:46:13] amen all
[1:46:17] right you see what I mean it's your
[1:46:19] thoughts become words and words will
[1:46:21] become material that's when the church
[1:46:23] is in its power I believe it's on the
[1:46:25] road that's what I was referring to
[1:46:26] right there when the church will be so
[1:46:27] wrapped in Christ and the Holy Spirit
[1:46:30] mankind so away from themselves that
[1:46:32] they don't see themselves wow is't that
[1:46:34] great they don't have no thoughts but to
[1:46:37] serve God and their thoughts move on
[1:46:40] they refuse the things of the world they
[1:46:42] just move in the spirit live in the
[1:46:43] spirit move in the spirit walk in the
[1:46:45] spirit so fulfill the law of
[1:46:48] Christ then the love of Christ is in the
[1:46:51] human heart moving in the Holy H ghost
[1:46:53] that great wonderful C church will go
[1:46:56] forth with power and deity because deity
[1:46:59] will be revealed in human beings by the
[1:47:02] Holy Spirit bringing to pass the thought
[1:47:04] of their mind look at Malachi 4 here
[1:47:08] prophesying
[1:47:10] right of what that corner turning
[1:47:13] did and is doing
[1:47:17] amen all right now now okay now I'm I
[1:47:22] just stand with me would you please I
[1:47:24] don't want to hear music quite yet but
[1:47:25] I'm just going to finish with this just
[1:47:27] stand
[1:47:28] up don't miss the don't miss them hold
[1:47:31] on just a
[1:47:33] minute I want to read this one quote Tim
[1:47:36] right here before a word it's a thought
[1:47:39] and a thought has to be created God's
[1:47:42] thoughts become creation when it's spoke
[1:47:44] by a
[1:47:45] word then when he presents it to you as
[1:47:48] a
[1:47:50] thought this is your capping right here
[1:47:53] when he presents it to you as a thought
[1:47:55] his thoughts and it's revealed to
[1:47:59] you then it's still a thought until you
[1:48:01] speak
[1:48:04] it okay God bless
[1:48:08] you my sheep hear my voice the logos in
[1:48:12] the word the thought
[1:48:16] spoken watch what God's doing what is he
[1:48:19] revealing to you he's revealing the
[1:48:22] logos the thought in that word and
[1:48:24] what's revealed to you is still a
[1:48:25] thought but whose thought is
[1:48:29] it if you want to say it's my thought
[1:48:32] the word it's truth if you want to say
[1:48:34] it's my thought the man it's untruth
[1:48:37] because it's God's word it's God's
[1:48:39] thought and when it's revealed in you
[1:48:41] and you speak it heavens and earth will
[1:48:43] pass away but that thing's got to
[1:48:46] happen why because it's a direct
[1:48:48] revelation of the mind of God it's the
[1:48:51] word of life
[1:48:54] am all right now amen and the Revelation
