[10:45] This old world
[10:48] can never hold me
[10:51] any moment
[10:54] and I'll be gone.
[10:57] For I've made
[11:00] my consecration

[12:21] Amen. Why don't we stand together for
[12:24] this next song number 611?
[12:29] I have found a friend in Jesus. He's
[12:33] everything to me. He's the fairest of
[12:37] 10,000 to my soul.
[12:42] The lily of the valley. In him alone I
[12:46] see. All I need to cleanse and make me
[12:50] fully whole.
[12:53] In sorrow he's my comfort. In trouble
[12:58] he's my stay. He tells me every care on
[13:02] him to roll. Hallelujah. He's the lily
[13:07] of the valley, the bright and morning
[13:10] star. He's the fairest of 10,000 to my
[13:15] soul.
[13:17] He all my grief has taken and all my
[13:22] sorrows born. In temptation, he's my
[13:26] strong and mighty town.
[13:29] I have all for him forsaken and all my
[13:34] idols torn from my heart. And now he
[13:38] keeps me by his power.
[13:41] Though all the world forsake me and
[13:45] Satan tempts me sore. Through Jesus I
[13:49] shall safely reach the goal. Hallelujah.
[13:53] He's the lily of the valley, the bright
[13:58] and morning star. He's the fairest of
[14:01] 10,000 to my soul.
[14:05] He will never never leave me nor yet
[14:10] forsake me here. While I live by faith
[14:13] and do his blessed will.
[14:18] A wall of fire about me. I have nothing
[14:22] now to fear. With his menhe my hungry
[14:26] soul shall fill.
[14:30] Then sweeping up to glory to see his
[14:34] blessed face where rivers of delight
[14:38] shall ever roll.
[14:41] Oh, he's the lily of the valley, the
[14:45] bright and morning star. He's the
[14:48] fairest of 10,000 to my soul.
[14:53] Oh, he's the lily of the valley, the
[14:57] bright and morning star. He's the
[15:00] fairest of 10,000 to my soul.
[15:07] Amen.
[15:09] Praise the Lord. We'll go to prayer with
[15:11] this next song. Number 443, please.
[15:14] [Music]

[16:46] Take your burden to the Lord and leave
[16:53] it there.
[16:55] [Music]

[17:04] and your health you can't regain
[17:09] and your soul is almost sinking in
[17:15] despair.

[18:29] leave it there.
[18:35] and your eneies
[18:37] [Music]

[18:41] and your heart begins to fail.
[18:46] Don't forget that God in heaven
[18:52] answers prayer.

[20:00] Take your burden to the Lord and leaveth
[20:07] it.
[20:08] [Music]
[20:12] When your youthful days are gone,
[20:18] and old age is stealing
[20:22] on, and your body bears beneath the
[20:28] weight of care.
[20:34] He will never leave you. Then he'll go
[20:41] with you to the end.
[20:48] Take your burden to the Lord and leave
[20:55] it there.
[21:00] Leave it there.
[21:06] Leave it there.
[21:11] Take your burden to the Lord and leave
[21:18] it there.

[35:42] Amen. Is it wonderful today just to have
[35:46] this opportunity to just give our life
[35:48] to him? Amen. Let him control our life.
[35:52] You know, we do pretty good as humans
[35:55] and planning our life out. But I tell
[35:58] you, our life is much better when we
[36:00] leave the planning to our Lord Jesus
[36:02] Christ and just let him guide us. Amen.
[36:05] And as he guides us, my brother and
[36:07] sister, we don't always understand
[36:10] uh exactly the footsteps that God takes
[36:12] us on. But if you fully trust him, then
[36:17] you know that he has and is taking you
[36:21] in a perfect plan, a perfect place. God
[36:24] bless you to each and everyone. God
[36:26] bless you. Uh Gideon, Lily, good to see
[36:28] you here. It was nice to be able to
[36:30] greet them. and um um Manasse and Katie.
[36:35] Good to see you guys here today. And
[36:37] each and every one of you, our dear
[36:39] sister back there. I don't guess I even
[36:41] know your name, but God bless you. Good
[36:43] to see you again today. And uh we just
[36:46] thank the Lord for his grace and mercy.
[36:49] Amen. I want to bring uh greetings to
[36:51] you from our brother George Smith. And
[36:54] uh he just um asks that you would just
[36:56] remember him in prayer. Um, Brother
[36:59] George is getting a little older and uh
[37:03] still just uh traveling uh preaching and
[37:08] uh all all the things he feels like
[37:10] God's called him to do. I'm going to do
[37:13] something just a little bit different
[37:15] this morning. I hope that uh it is okay.
[37:18] But um Sister Dorcas, is it okay to
[37:22] share your text to me?
[37:26] We
[37:28] Just want to lift and very seriousness
[37:31] our sister Dorcas as the doctors uh have
[37:34] diagnosed what they believe to be
[37:37] lymphoma.
[37:40] You know the devil just doesn't give up.
[37:45] If he sees life, he does everything he
[37:48] can do to destroy that life because he
[37:52] is so afraid of one person
[37:56] fully committed to God defeating him.
[37:59] Now imagine the whole bride of Jesus
[38:01] Christ. How that Satan he he he just
[38:04] works overtime because he cannot stand
[38:08] the thought that you, yes, the bride of
[38:11] Christ, you are going to defeat him. He
[38:15] has spent all these seven ages
[38:17] perfecting his plan on how to deceive
[38:21] and destroy mankind.
[38:23] And when he sees a a son or a daughter
[38:26] of God rising up and saying, "You know
[38:28] what? In spite of everything that's
[38:31] happening, I still believe." Amen. I
[38:34] want to ask our sister Dorcas to come
[38:36] forward. I'd ask the brothers of the
[38:38] church to come forward. We want to lay
[38:40] our hands upon sister Dorcas according
[38:42] to the word of God. And uh it says if we
[38:46] lay our hands upon that and we believe
[38:47] they shall recover. And I believe Mark
[38:50] 16 is just as true and powerful today as
[38:54] when it was pinned into the scripture.
[38:57] Amen. Do we believe that?
[38:59] &gt;&gt; Amen. We believe God is our healer and
[39:02] we're not here defeated. You say, "But a
[39:05] a brother or sister, somebody passed
[39:07] away, a heart attack, a this or that."
[39:09] My brother and sister, God chooses the
[39:11] path that he takes us from this world.
[39:14] We will not allow Satan to choose that
[39:16] path for us. Amen. If we go down in the
[39:19] battle, we will go down victorious.
[39:22] Amen. You say, "What?" No, it is. When
[39:25] you go down, a believer goes down in the
[39:28] battle, he is still victorious in the
[39:30] name of Jesus Christ. Sister Dorcas,
[39:32] would you come? My brothers, would you
[39:35] come? Amen. We just want to according to
[39:38] the word of God, we want to lay hands
[39:40] upon her. And if we would just stand and
[39:43] we would each one join uh in faith uh
[39:47] the prayer of faith. Amen. The prayer of
[39:51] the righteous, the scripture says
[39:53] avaleth much. And uh we would just Amen.
[39:58] We believe that we our prayers are going
[40:00] to avail much. Amen. Today amen. Sister
[40:05] Dorcas, we come as believers and
[40:10] believing that you and all the things
[40:12] that you have faced in your life have
[40:15] proven by your life that you are an
[40:18] overcomer that you are a daughter of God
[40:21] and the very life of Jesus Christ is
[40:25] manifested in your determination to
[40:27] serve the Lord. Amen. to stand
[40:29] faithfully on the word and we would just
[40:32] come today as your brothers. Amen.
[40:35] Brothers and sisters, just to bind as
[40:38] the prophet said, we bind our faith
[40:41] together. It will not be my faith.
[40:45] It will be your faith. But we bind our
[40:47] faith with your faith. And we leave with
[40:50] all of our heart that God has heard your
[40:52] cry, sees your situation, and is here to
[40:55] touch your body. Amen. Let's bow our
[40:58] heads. Amen. Heavenly Father, Lord
[41:02] Jesus, as we come before you today,
[41:04] Lord, already just the things Lord that
[41:07] you know that have confirmed that you
[41:09] are here. Lord, we would just come, we
[41:12] lay our hands upon our sister, according
[41:14] to the word of God, Lord, according to
[41:16] the leadership of your Holy Spirit.
[41:19] Father, you said that if we would ask
[41:21] anything in your name and not doubt it,
[41:23] not question it, Father, that you would
[41:25] give that to us. And today, Father, we
[41:28] just bind our faith with our sister
[41:30] Dorcas, Lord, and believe that healing
[41:32] is already in her, Father. We would just
[41:35] ask, Lord, that healing virtue would
[41:37] flow through her body today. Let no
[41:40] words, no thoughts, no deeds of doubt
[41:42] come to take this victory away from our
[41:44] sister. Lord, you can come, Father, and
[41:47] just move through her right now. And
[41:49] that's what we come according to your
[41:51] word, believing for. Your word tells us
[41:53] to believe for life. Lord, we your word
[41:56] tells us that we claim life and what we
[41:59] speak will come to pass. We ask you,
[42:01] Lord, just to touch our dear sister.
[42:03] Start the process even now, Father, that
[42:06] the Holy Spirit moving through her,
[42:09] Lord, will just start to restore the
[42:11] blood cell. Start to restore everything
[42:13] that Satan has tried to put out of
[42:15] order. But Lord, we know that you are
[42:18] the perfect one. And Lord, we put our
[42:21] sister under the blood of the perfect
[42:23] one this morning. Lord, that healing
[42:25] virtue will come. Lord, we confess it,
[42:28] we believe it, and we send it forth with
[42:30] a confession that our sister is healed
[42:32] in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen.
[42:35] Sister Dorcas, just as a prophet in the
[42:37] prayer lines over and over and over
[42:39] again told those that he prayed for, go
[42:42] believing, go confessing. Amen. Our Lord
[42:45] and Savior Jesus Christ is your healer
[42:48] today. Lord, we thank you in your
[42:50] precious name. Amen and amen.
[42:53] Hallelujah. Can we lift our hands and
[42:55] thank the Lord this morning? Amen. For
[42:57] this word, my brother and sister, this
[43:00] word is not just concerning sickness of
[43:02] the body, but it's cons sickness of the
[43:05] of the spirit and of the mind, of the
[43:08] emotion, and all of these things. He's
[43:10] our healer. It's time for us to come and
[43:12] claim what God has already given us.
[43:15] Amen. To stand on the word of God today,
[43:18] my brother and sister. You say, "Oh, oh,
[43:21] I I believe. I believe." But my brother
[43:23] and sister, it takes more than that. The
[43:25] devil believes.
[43:27] &gt;&gt; The devil believes this is true. The
[43:29] devil knows that this is powerful, but
[43:32] he will not leave it. He live it. He
[43:35] cannot live it. But God has given you
[43:38] the ability to live it. Amen. Can we
[43:41] just say thank you, Lord, for that
[43:42] ability to live the word. Amen.
[43:45] Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Amen.
[43:49] I'd like to announce a youth meeting at
[43:52] Brother Alex and Sister Rachel's this
[43:54] Friday at 700 p.m. Might be news to
[43:57] Sister Rachel. No. Uh and uh so
[44:01] hopefully youth, young people, we
[44:04] haven't put an age cap on it. So if you
[44:06] feel young, you can show up.
[44:10] Some of you just look at me like
[44:12] some of you get it.
[44:15] Amen. So anyway, we just invite one and
[44:18] all uh um come with an expectation.
[44:21] Amen. It's good. We have fellowship, but
[44:23] we're really there to just reach into
[44:24] the word, pull something out that would
[44:27] impact our lives. Amen. So, um Brother
[44:31] Alex, Sister Rachel, 7 p.m. this coming
[44:34] Friday. And then uh don't know if this
[44:37] is the right time, but um sister Jerry
[44:40] and I will be uh fulfilling a promise I
[44:43] made to brother Jose and we will be
[44:45] traveling up to the Tri Cities to speak
[44:48] at the little assembly there in the Tri
[44:50] Cities this coming weekend. And uh we
[44:53] desire your prayers, travel mercies that
[44:56] Lord would give to us. And um we we
[44:59] don't normally make much of it, but um I
[45:02] just uh heard that somebody had a
[45:05] birthday this last week. And uh so we
[45:08] just uh want to wish happy birthday to
[45:10] our sister Vika. And uh I appreciate I
[45:14] appreciate all of our musicians. Not
[45:16] trying to single anyone out, but I
[45:18] really appreciate sister Vika puts her
[45:20] heart into playing the piano for us. And
[45:23] I believe that we are blessed by the
[45:25] gift that God has given her. and we say
[45:28] thank you and happy birthday, Sister
[45:30] Vika. Amen. Amen. Let's uh turn in our
[45:34] Bibles this morning. I got kind of a
[45:38] unique title that um I hope you don't
[45:41] judge too quickly on the title, but uh
[45:46] when the word is not enough.
[45:50] And it would appear that we would think
[45:52] there is something more that is
[45:54] necessary and actually there is. And uh
[45:58] we often times say well we've we've got
[46:00] the word for our hour and uh that's all
[46:04] we need. But even the prophet of God
[46:07] come and said you know what there's
[46:08] something you need besides just the
[46:10] word. And we'll touch on that today. And
[46:13] uh if you'll be patient with me, turn in
[46:15] your Bibles to the 2 chapter of James
[46:18] verses 14- 26. And um uh very familiar
[46:24] scripture uh that uh that we have heard
[46:28] and has been preached on many times.
[46:30] James the 2 chapter verse 14 through
[46:33] verse 26.
[46:36] What does it profit my brethren? Though
[46:38] a man say he hath faith and have not
[46:41] works, can faith save him? If a brother
[46:46] or sister be naked, and destitute of
[46:48] daily food, and one of you say unto
[46:51] them, Depart in peace, be ye warmed and
[46:54] filled, notwithstanding, you give them
[46:56] not those things which are needful to
[46:58] the body, what doth it profit? Now, my
[47:01] brother and sister, Brother Brandham
[47:03] speaking uh along the lines of a painted
[47:06] fire. If you just offer somebody
[47:08] something symbolic, not real, they're
[47:12] not going to be warmed by a painted
[47:15] fire. And if you just tell them, "Oh,
[47:17] oh, you'll be blessed." And there is
[47:20] nothing to back it up as the scriptures
[47:23] just shared with us.
[47:26] Yay.
[47:28] Oh, let me go back up. Even so faith, if
[47:31] it hath not works, is dead being alone.
[47:35] Yay, a man may say, "Thou hast faith,
[47:37] and I have works. Show me thy faith
[47:39] without thy works, and I will show thee
[47:41] my faith by my works. Thou believest
[47:44] that there is one God thou doest well?"
[47:48] That ought to catch all the trinitarians
[47:50] right there. The devils also believe and
[47:53] tremble. But wilt thou know, O vain man,
[47:57] that faith without works is dead? Was
[48:00] not Abraham our father justified by
[48:03] works when he had offered Isaac his son
[48:05] upon the altar? Seeest thou how faith
[48:08] wrought with with his works and by works
[48:12] was faith made perfect. And the
[48:14] scripture was fulfilled which saith
[48:17] Abraham believed God and it was imputed
[48:20] unto him for righteousness and he was
[48:22] called the friend of God. Ye see then
[48:26] how that by works a man is justified and
[48:29] not by faith only. I want you to think
[48:32] about our title today. Amen. Not by
[48:35] faith only. Likewise also was not Rahab
[48:39] the harlot justified by works. When she
[48:41] had received the messengers and had sent
[48:43] them out another way. For as the body
[48:46] without the spirit is dead, so faith
[48:49] without works is dead also. Heavenly
[48:53] Father, we ask Lord that you would just
[48:54] bless the word today. Lead us, Father.
[48:57] Let it be a portion for each and
[48:59] everyone here. Lord, you know how to
[49:01] rightly divide your word to each and
[49:03] every life. Lord, we just ask, Father,
[49:06] you would use us as a vessel, but Lord,
[49:08] let us be set aside that it be your
[49:10] words and not ours. We ask this in the
[49:13] precious name of Jesus Christ that you
[49:15] would move in the midst of your people
[49:16] today, touch lives, change lives, open
[49:20] things. Father, reveal things, Father.
[49:23] Lord, that we could walk away a better
[49:26] Christian, a better son or daughter of
[49:28] God. We ask it in your precious name.
[49:30] Amen. You may be seated. Amen.
[49:36] Now, my statement may seem kind of
[49:38] strong to actually make a statement that
[49:42] the word is not enough. And we'll look
[49:46] at this. If you um if we look in the
[49:49] overall context of of what I'm trying to
[49:52] say today, you'll see that many a person
[49:55] has a Bible. Uh many a person has their
[49:58] study guide. They have their books, they
[50:00] have their tapes and is actually a weak
[50:03] Christian. That having the Bible, having
[50:06] uh books, tapes, etc. does not make a
[50:10] person a strong Christian. It takes
[50:12] something more than just having the
[50:14] resource on the shelf. Those of you that
[50:17] are in school and studying and taking
[50:19] tests. Just because you have the book in
[50:21] your backpack doesn't mean you'll pass
[50:23] the test. You have to dig into the book
[50:26] and glean what is in the book for you
[50:29] out of it for you to come. And and we'll
[50:32] look in the day that we're living. I
[50:34] remember a brother one time we were
[50:35] discussing a certain situation and I
[50:38] said I shared with him a little
[50:40] testimony uh about how that I had been
[50:43] so disappointed by a a particular person
[50:47] uh their behavior and and he told me and
[50:51] I won't go into the details of that but
[50:53] he says you know what what is really
[50:55] discouraging is is when people uh very
[50:59] things I I'll just go ahead and share it
[51:01] I mean if I hope it doesn't uh offend
[51:03] offend anyone. But he said, "What really
[51:05] bothers me is when people say that they
[51:08] believe everything the prophet of God
[51:09] said and you go in their home and
[51:11] there's a picture of the cloud and a
[51:13] picture of the prophet on top of their
[51:15] 60-in screen TV that is hooked to
[51:18] Netflix and everything else." He says,
[51:20] "You know, the prophet of God said,
[51:22] throw that thing out of your house." And
[51:24] and yet, you know, my brother and
[51:25] sister, we live in a day that we can
[51:28] compromise. We can we can do that and we
[51:30] we'll take a certain angle and and we
[51:33] would look at it and say but you know
[51:34] they do this and my brother and sister
[51:37] it doesn't matter if we have those
[51:38] things in our life that are a hindrance
[51:41] to us. Reminds me one time this might
[51:43] sound silly if you don't mind me using
[51:45] something silly but a man at the boat
[51:48] ramp you know he was there brand new
[51:49] pickup brand new boat and all the
[51:51] perfect fishing gear and and it just
[51:54] looked like this man had it all. And as
[51:56] he went to pull away from the boat ramp,
[51:58] uh the boat didn't seem to want to
[52:00] respond. And finally, somebody come up
[52:03] to him and sir, you have to unhook the
[52:05] boat from the trailer first.
[52:08] And so that's what we got to do today,
[52:10] my brother and sister. We got to unhook
[52:12] oursel from Leodysa before we can
[52:15] actually make progress to go forward.
[52:18] It's not enough that we have books and
[52:20] tapes and resource on the shelf. We
[52:22] actually have to take that and apply it
[52:25] in our life to move forward. We have to
[52:28] break through uh break away from the
[52:30] spirit of Leodysa if we expect to make
[52:33] any progress as a believer. And so you
[52:37] know look at that and to be a weak or or
[52:41] uh uh um ineffective Christian it it
[52:44] shows that there is something lacking in
[52:46] our life. And if you think, my brother
[52:47] and sister, if brother Paul is is
[52:49] preaching down at you today, you're
[52:51] mistaken because everything I will say
[52:53] today applies to me also. Every one of
[52:57] us, we live by the same rules. There's
[52:59] no exemptions in the word of God. Amen.
[53:02] I want you to think about that. Enoch
[53:04] didn't have an exemption. Amen. That
[53:07] caused him to to please God and walk off
[53:10] the earth. my brother and sister,
[53:12] because of the exemption. Every one of
[53:14] us, we play by the exact same rules, the
[53:16] same word of God. So, just let that
[53:19] apply to you. If it fits, apply it.
[53:22] Amen. If it isn't for you, it doesn't
[53:24] affect you in that way and it's the word
[53:26] of God, just say amen. And just go on.
[53:29] Don't let don't let it detour you. But
[53:31] you see, if we're lacking something, now
[53:34] remember, Brother Brandon brings a
[53:36] little story and people say, "Oh, that's
[53:38] such an interesting story of the little
[53:40] boy that ate the petal off a bicycle."
[53:43] Now, my brother and sister, no one in
[53:45] their natural side would say, "Oh, that
[53:47] little boy has a sulfur deficiency.
[53:50] Let's give him a petal off a bicycle."
[53:52] The doctor wouldn't say, "Just buy him a
[53:54] go down to the hardware store and buy
[53:56] him a pedal and let him eat it." But
[53:57] there was something in that boy that
[53:59] sensed there was something in that
[54:01] bicycle pedal. Amen. The rubber there,
[54:04] the sulfur in that whether he smelled
[54:06] it, there some sense that was there and
[54:08] he starts eating the pedal of a bicycle
[54:11] and it satisfies what it is or starts to
[54:14] satisfy what it is that he's lacking. So
[54:17] my brother and sister, don't take that
[54:19] as a story uh that the prophet gave. He
[54:21] was making a point that when there is
[54:23] something lacking in our lives, God is
[54:26] going to put something in you to seek
[54:29] what you are lacking. Now, if you don't
[54:31] really care how you live and you don't
[54:33] care what is going on around you and
[54:35] you're just going to live every day to
[54:37] be satisfied for the day, then you don't
[54:40] sense what is lacking. There's nothing
[54:42] anyone can do for you. It would take a
[54:44] move of the Holy Spirit to cause you to
[54:46] realize, I need something. And for sons
[54:49] and daughters of God, we are not, my
[54:51] brother and sister, of this world. We
[54:53] weren't created for this world. We were
[54:55] created to serve God. Can we say amen to
[54:57] that? Amen. And so created to serve God,
[55:00] what's lacking in our life, God is going
[55:03] to put in there a a something to satisfy
[55:07] that. And so it's there that we'll find
[55:09] that for sons and daughters of God.
[55:12] Amen. The word is what we need. Now, my
[55:15] title would think that I'm declaring
[55:18] that there's a time that the word is not
[55:20] enough. I don't want you to
[55:21] misunderstand this morning that we're
[55:24] not saying the word is insufficient, but
[55:26] the prophet of God lays out something
[55:28] very clear to us that it's not just the
[55:31] word that we need. We have to have
[55:33] something more. I got inspired this
[55:36] morning. There's two things that
[55:37] happened. Amen. what I was studying,
[55:40] some things that I had, things I added
[55:42] into the the thought, some things I
[55:44] deleted. And when it comes down to, and
[55:47] I'm studying, there's usually songs that
[55:49] come to me. And uh you know, I was there
[55:52] and wrote on the bottom of my notes the
[55:54] lily of the valley. And then I thought,
[55:56] well, you know what? I'm trying to break
[55:58] my habit of trying to be this preacher
[56:00] and the song leader. And so I just
[56:03] erased the lily off the valley lily of
[56:05] the valley off my notes because hey we
[56:08] got a song leader let him come and what
[56:10] the Lord lays on his heart. Then I am
[56:12] here and I hear and brother Alex then
[56:15] sings lily of the valley and I thought
[56:18] thank you Lord but what struck me the
[56:19] most I won't go into the detail of it
[56:22] but we're in the back and brother Alex
[56:24] is there going to bless the service and
[56:26] he literally prays an outline of what I
[56:29] have been studying. My brother and
[56:30] sister, you talk about God touching your
[56:32] heart to give you a little bit of
[56:34] confidence that what you are thinking,
[56:37] what you want to uh speak on is not just
[56:40] your own thoughts because God is dealing
[56:42] with others on the very same thought.
[56:44] And I would pray today that God is
[56:46] dealing with you along these lines also.
[56:48] Amen. So if there's something lacking in
[56:51] our life, you know, oftent times a very
[56:53] easy one for us to say is I need to pray
[56:55] more. Can anybody say, "I I agree with
[56:57] that." That that I know that I need to
[56:59] pray more. So, what is causing you to
[57:02] say, "I need to pray more." You're
[57:03] recognizing there's a lack in your life.
[57:06] Amen. You're recognizing that that
[57:08] there's something there that you should
[57:10] do. And so, we come, if we're not
[57:13] careful, we'll l we'll ignore or uh uh
[57:16] go on lacking uh that because I'm too
[57:20] busy. I'm this. I'm that. But you see,
[57:23] if you really are hungry,
[57:25] you'll find something to eat.
[57:28] And the prophet of God shows us that
[57:30] there was people who once ate from a
[57:32] fine table are now eating out of a
[57:35] garbage can
[57:37] because they couldn't find something to
[57:39] satisfy the hunger. But we're sitting
[57:41] here this morning by the grace of God.
[57:44] Can we say the grace of God? Amen. We
[57:46] are here by the grace of God. we have
[57:49] something to satisfy that hunger. We
[57:52] don't have to go to a garbage can. We
[57:55] can go right into the word of God in the
[57:57] presence of God and have that satisfied.
[58:00] Now, in James 1:es 1-8,
[58:04] James, a servant of God and of the Lord
[58:06] Jesus Christ, to the 12 tribes that are
[58:08] scattered abroad, greeting, my brother,
[58:12] count it all joy when you fall in
[58:14] diverse temptations. Every time I read
[58:17] this scripture, I'm thinking, "Wow,
[58:19] without a little better understanding of
[58:20] the word of God, how could we count it
[58:23] joy when we fall into diverse
[58:25] temptations? When when we are tested,
[58:28] when we are struggling with things
[58:30] around us, how could we count that as
[58:32] joy?" But my brother and sister, verse
[58:34] three says, "Knowing this that the
[58:36] trying of your faith workketh patience."
[58:40] So he's not saying that you are an
[58:42] unbeliever because you have come into
[58:45] this diverse temptation, these deep
[58:47] temptations, these temptations of the
[58:50] flesh and of the mind and emotion. It is
[58:53] not that you are there suddenly a
[58:56] sinner, suddenly an unbeliever, suddenly
[58:58] a heathen as we would use that word. But
[59:01] my brother and sister, this is God
[59:03] working to the trying of your faith to
[59:06] give you more patience to come to the
[59:08] place, you know, I don't know about you,
[59:12] but there's times like as being a
[59:14] pastor, it's kind of become a joke, and
[59:17] I don't mean it jokingly, but there's
[59:18] times that I quit being a pastor every
[59:21] single week.
[59:25] I can't do this anymore.
[59:30] But you know what happens
[59:32] after what brings about that? God always
[59:36] comes and pours in a little bomb of
[59:38] Gilead.
[59:40] And when it's all done, it's like, wait,
[59:43] I'm not a quitter.
[59:46] And I know for a fact that God has
[59:49] brought me into this position.
[59:53] And if I walk away from that, I I can't
[59:55] just go sit on a pew and say, I'm not
[59:57] going to be a pastor. I'm not going to
[59:58] be a shepherd anymore. I'm just going to
[1:00:00] sit on the pew and be content. And in
[1:00:03] just a week or two or three, I'll have
[1:00:05] so many sermons piled up. I'll be
[1:00:08] tormented
[1:00:10] that I want to preach this. I need to
[1:00:12] preach this. I want to share this. I got
[1:00:14] to find somebody to share this with. You
[1:00:17] see, God creates in us this desire and
[1:00:20] this ability to live the word. And my
[1:00:22] brother and sister, people can backslide
[1:00:24] for years. Amen. And they will tell you,
[1:00:27] I I know these men. I know these
[1:00:29] examples. They backslid for years. And
[1:00:31] when they come back to the Lord, they
[1:00:33] say, I have been miserable for 25 years.
[1:00:37] &gt;&gt; You'd say, but why didn't you come back
[1:00:38] and serve God if you've been miserable
[1:00:40] this whole time? And they have a whole
[1:00:42] list. Well, I didn't know if the God
[1:00:44] would accept me, and I don't know if the
[1:00:46] people would accept me, and I don't know
[1:00:47] if I wouldn't just backslide or fall
[1:00:50] again. I don't know this, and I don't
[1:00:52] know that. But there comes a time that
[1:00:54] they finally come to the place that the
[1:00:56] only thing that will satisfy them is the
[1:00:59] word of God. And and they have to come
[1:01:01] back in that presence. They have to come
[1:01:04] and and worship him and serve him again
[1:01:06] because that's the only place in their
[1:01:08] life they've ever found rest and peace
[1:01:10] and comfort. Amen. But let patience have
[1:01:14] her perfect work, that ye may be perfect
[1:01:17] and entire, wanting nothing.
[1:01:20] For any of you lack wisdom, if any of
[1:01:23] you lack wisdom, let him ask of God that
[1:01:26] giveth to all men libery, and upgradeth
[1:01:28] not, and it shall be given him. Now, I
[1:01:31] want to just venture a little bit, if
[1:01:33] you don't mind, this morning outside the
[1:01:35] boundary of the scripture. Not trying to
[1:01:37] change the wording, but I just want to
[1:01:39] draw this out. If you if any of you
[1:01:42] lack,
[1:01:44] and let's just put a line right there,
[1:01:46] and it doesn't have to say wisdom. What
[1:01:48] is it you lacked this morning? If any of
[1:01:52] you lacked something in your life this
[1:01:54] morning,
[1:01:56] the scripture is telling you if you
[1:01:57] lacked wisdom, ask. Let him ask of God.
[1:02:03] But if there is something deeper besides
[1:02:05] wisdom in your life, you have no peace,
[1:02:07] you have no comfort, you're troubled in
[1:02:09] your spirit, you're troubled in your
[1:02:10] mind, whatever it might be, ask God.
[1:02:15] Don't just sit there and say, you know,
[1:02:16] I guess this is my lot in life that I'm
[1:02:19] here with no peace, no comfort,
[1:02:22] no security,
[1:02:24] but my brother and sister, if you lack,
[1:02:27] ask God.
[1:02:29] &gt;&gt; He is faithful. He says, "You ask
[1:02:30] anything in my name and I'll give it to
[1:02:32] you."
[1:02:33] &gt;&gt; Amen. He's not talking about a Bentley
[1:02:35] or a mansion. He's talking about a
[1:02:38] spiritual position that you and I would
[1:02:40] come in. But if we're sitting here, I
[1:02:42] hope I'm not too blunt this morning, but
[1:02:43] I I think I'm starting to understand
[1:02:45] after all these years, starting to
[1:02:47] understand humanity, uh humanity, my
[1:02:50] brother and sister, we're sitting here
[1:02:51] today and every single one of us is
[1:02:54] lacking things in our life.
[1:02:58] &gt;&gt; I want to know, are you asking God
[1:02:59] daily?
[1:03:02] &gt;&gt; Maybe you've been raised up with uh you
[1:03:04] ask God once and never bring it up
[1:03:06] again.
[1:03:07] Well, I'm going to tell you that doesn't
[1:03:09] fit the scripture.
[1:03:12] &gt;&gt; You need to ask God if you lack
[1:03:14] something in your life.
[1:03:16] &gt;&gt; Whether it be wisdom or peace or comfort
[1:03:18] or understanding, you want more. Prophet
[1:03:20] of God says pray for revelation. He
[1:03:22] didn't say pray for revelation once and
[1:03:24] go on. He says pray for revelation.
[1:03:26] That's one of the most important things
[1:03:28] you should pray for. And I would say
[1:03:30] today what we lack in our life, we
[1:03:32] should. I don't care what position
[1:03:34] you're in today. Whether you've been
[1:03:36] serving God for 40 years or you've been
[1:03:38] serving God for 40 minutes. Amen. You
[1:03:40] need to have the confidence and
[1:03:42] understanding God's here and he wants
[1:03:44] you to ask him. He wants you to call out
[1:03:48] to him and claim what it is you lack in
[1:03:51] your life. And he says here, amen, that
[1:03:54] he giveth to all men libery and
[1:03:55] upgradeth not, and it shall be given
[1:03:58] him. I say today,
[1:04:00] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:04:01] &gt;&gt; Let's ask God for what we're lacking.
[1:04:03] Let's let's put our hand in our heart up
[1:04:06] and say, "Lord, I I have things in my
[1:04:09] life that I know need to change. I'm
[1:04:12] lacking in that position and and Lord, I
[1:04:14] I'm not going to approach you." Now, my
[1:04:16] brother and sister, if if you haven't
[1:04:18] repented before the Lord, you really
[1:04:20] should put things in the correct order.
[1:04:22] But I'm telling you, I've seen it over
[1:04:24] and over again that people who were not
[1:04:25] even saved, but sincere desiring God,
[1:04:29] ask for things in their lives, not
[1:04:32] material things, but spiritual things,
[1:04:34] and God come on the scene and give that
[1:04:37] to them. What's he doing? He's sending
[1:04:39] you a love letter. He's sending you a
[1:04:41] bouquet of flowers. He's letting you
[1:04:43] know, I hear your prayer. I hear your
[1:04:46] cry. I hear your need. And I'm here to
[1:04:49] let you know I'm here to be your savior.
[1:04:51] I'm here to be your healer. I'm here to
[1:04:54] be what's lacking in your life.
[1:04:57] &gt;&gt; But it's amazing. The scripture says
[1:04:59] that we have not because we ask not.
[1:05:03] &gt;&gt; But when we do finally get around to
[1:05:05] asking, we don't even ask correctly.
[1:05:10] &gt;&gt; Lord, help us to ask correctly. Let it
[1:05:13] not be a selfish prayer. Let it not be
[1:05:15] for selfish reasons, but let it be for
[1:05:18] the reasons that Lord, we could come
[1:05:20] closer to you. We could be a better
[1:05:22] Christian. We could serve you better.
[1:05:24] Lord, I'm desiring to be a better
[1:05:26] husband, a better father, a a better
[1:05:28] wife, a better mother, a better daughter
[1:05:30] of God, a better son of God. This is my
[1:05:33] desire, Lord. This is what I'm longing
[1:05:35] for. And I recognize things lacking in
[1:05:37] my life.
[1:05:39] You realize my brother and sister that
[1:05:43] our children,
[1:05:46] you look through, you look through the
[1:05:48] the
[1:05:50] experience of being a parent
[1:05:54] and typically the child that you
[1:05:56] struggle the most with and the parent
[1:05:58] you struggle the most with is the one
[1:06:01] you're most like.
[1:06:05] &gt;&gt; Did you get me?
[1:06:08] I don't get along with my dad. I don't
[1:06:10] get along with my mom. I don't get along
[1:06:12] with my sister, my brother,
[1:06:17] grandma or grandpa.
[1:06:19] &gt;&gt; You'll find that you carry the same
[1:06:22] traits,
[1:06:24] &gt;&gt; they do.
[1:06:26] And the very thing I find it humorous
[1:06:28] actually, very ironic, the very traits
[1:06:30] that you dislike is who you are.
[1:06:34] So ultimately you don't even like
[1:06:36] yourself.
[1:06:38] So what do you need?
[1:06:41] You need understanding.
[1:06:43] You need wisdom. And if you lack those
[1:06:46] things, you will never be able to forge
[1:06:48] a relationship with that individual when
[1:06:51] you are in that condition. But when you
[1:06:54] start to understand that every one of us
[1:06:56] stands before God as a sinner saved by
[1:06:58] grace. Amen. and that God overlooked our
[1:07:01] need and overlooked our shortcoming and
[1:07:03] our failure. God overlooked those things
[1:07:05] in our life. And by grace, we'll
[1:07:07] overlook that in their lives. And we'll
[1:07:09] pray for wisdom to realize that just as
[1:07:12] annoying as they are to you, you are
[1:07:14] that annoying to them.
[1:07:17] Oh my children, sorry,
[1:07:21] but if you think your parents are
[1:07:22] annoying, it's because you're annoying.
[1:07:25] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:07:26] &gt;&gt; Thank you.
[1:07:30] Amen.
[1:07:31] &gt;&gt; Yeah. God will amen his word. Amen.
[1:07:33] Thank you, brother. Amen. My brother and
[1:07:36] sister, you see, we get this idea that
[1:07:38] we've got it right and everyone else is
[1:07:40] lacking. But the problem is is while we
[1:07:42] think everyone else is lacking, we're
[1:07:44] actually the one who is lacking. We have
[1:07:47] no grace for each other. Well, we say
[1:07:49] they should have more grace, you need to
[1:07:51] have more grace. Or rather, you wouldn't
[1:07:52] be saying they need more grace, my
[1:07:54] brother and sister. You see, the very
[1:07:56] things that make our relationships work
[1:07:58] is usually something in our self that is
[1:08:01] lacking that we can do. Oh, that
[1:08:03] brother, he acts so spiritual. Well, why
[1:08:05] does it bother you that he acts so
[1:08:07] spiritual? If he's a hypocrite, pray for
[1:08:10] him.
[1:08:12] &gt;&gt; But if he's sincere, then maybe you
[1:08:15] might look in his life and see what is
[1:08:17] he doing different than you are doing.
[1:08:19] And why do you feel like it matters that
[1:08:21] you would judge them as they are too
[1:08:24] spiritual? Could we be too spiritual?
[1:08:29] &gt;&gt; Well, we can be so spiritual we're of no
[1:08:32] earthly value. And I hope actually I
[1:08:33] reach that point one day where I have no
[1:08:36] earthly value. And then if there's no
[1:08:39] earthly value, maybe God will just take
[1:08:41] us home and we'll be done. But you see
[1:08:44] my brother and sister, often times the
[1:08:47] very thing that we criticize is what's
[1:08:49] actually lacking in our own life.
[1:08:54] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:08:55] &gt;&gt; Amen. Say amen or ouch, one of the two.
[1:08:57] Okay?
[1:08:59] &gt;&gt; You know, amen.
[1:09:02] But let him ask in faith, nothing
[1:09:04] wavering. For he that waverth is like a
[1:09:07] wave of the sea driven with the wind and
[1:09:10] tossed. For let not that man think he
[1:09:13] shall receive anything of the Lord. A
[1:09:15] double-minded man is unstable
[1:09:19] in all his ways.
[1:09:24] My oh my. You see this is just not about
[1:09:27] picking one little thing out but this
[1:09:30] affects our whole entire life.
[1:09:34] Natural,
[1:09:36] spiritual
[1:09:38] relationships,
[1:09:40] everything. It affects it.
[1:09:43] &gt;&gt; You guys are quiet today.
[1:09:46] Now, many times in the last while, I've
[1:09:48] preached to you about our need for
[1:09:51] action.
[1:09:53] How that God, you know, Acts 2:38 says,
[1:09:56] "Repent." There's an action taking
[1:09:57] place, right? You're repenting. Amen.
[1:10:00] And be baptized. There's an action. You
[1:10:02] go to the water, you get baptized.
[1:10:04] There's an action that God promises you
[1:10:06] that when you repent and you get
[1:10:08] baptized in the name of Jesus Christ,
[1:10:11] you shall receive the gift of the Holy
[1:10:13] Ghost, my brother and sister. So, you
[1:10:15] see this scripture right here, Acts 2:38
[1:10:18] is full of action. That action's not
[1:10:21] just on God's part, but that action's
[1:10:23] also on our part. And when we fulfill
[1:10:25] our part, God fulfills his part. You
[1:10:28] see, so this is all a works, you might
[1:10:30] say. Now, we don't believe it's just
[1:10:32] works alone. You're not going to go do a
[1:10:34] million good deeds and make it to
[1:10:36] heaven. Amen. That won't work. That's
[1:10:38] not the kind of gospel God has presented
[1:10:40] to us. But we're not going to be the
[1:10:42] people who sit on our hands when we
[1:10:45] should have some action and we sit back
[1:10:47] and say, "If God wants it to happen,
[1:10:49] it'll happen." Well, you know, if you're
[1:10:51] a son or daughter of God, your name's on
[1:10:53] the Lamb's Book of Life, you might not
[1:10:55] like how God makes it happen. Amen.
[1:10:58] Sometimes God brings about very very
[1:11:00] drastic actions that causes us to pursue
[1:11:03] him. Amen. My brother and sister, why
[1:11:06] would we be so stubborn in the human
[1:11:08] element in our flesh, in our mind, and
[1:11:10] our emotions? Be so stubborn that we
[1:11:13] know we should and we don't. We won't do
[1:11:15] it because the preacher said, "I should
[1:11:18] do it. I'm not going to do it." Then my
[1:11:20] brother and sister, you realize the
[1:11:21] preacher is so ill in the picture of
[1:11:24] God. so irrelevant that God said it
[1:11:27] would be by the preaching of the word it
[1:11:28] would perfect you. But that's kind of an
[1:11:30] illrelevant thing, right? So it's there
[1:11:33] because he's not preaching. If he's
[1:11:34] preaching his own idea, you'll never
[1:11:36] come to perfection. So the preacher
[1:11:38] himself is like the messenger. I have
[1:11:41] never Amen. I have received some pretty
[1:11:43] hefty checks in the mail over my
[1:11:45] lifetime of companies that owed us a lot
[1:11:48] of money for crops and and and work that
[1:11:50] we did for them. I've never once went
[1:11:52] out, tackled the mailman, gave him a
[1:11:54] hug, and said, "Thank you for bringing
[1:11:56] me this money.
[1:11:58] He's just a carrier.
[1:12:01] He's not the money. He's not the
[1:12:04] original origin of it. He's just a
[1:12:06] carrier." My brother and sister, when
[1:12:08] you don't like what the words being
[1:12:10] spoken to you and it's being spoken in
[1:12:12] love, don't get mad at the preacher. Ask
[1:12:15] God to explain to you and open to your
[1:12:18] heart what it is God is trying to say to
[1:12:21] you.
[1:12:22] &gt;&gt; Amen. Now, if the preacher here is just
[1:12:24] a mean, vindictive man, go find another
[1:12:27] preacher. Don't don't sit there and
[1:12:29] learn to hate preachers because this man
[1:12:32] is mean and vindictive. Amen. He's not
[1:12:35] the message. He's just the messenger.
[1:12:38] He's just the carrier putting the mail
[1:12:40] in the mailbox. Cuz that same mailman
[1:12:43] that has delivered very large checks to
[1:12:46] my mailbox has also delivered very large
[1:12:49] bills to my mailbox. Amen. I would love
[1:12:51] him one day and hate him the next.
[1:12:55] But it has nothing to do with him. And
[1:12:57] when the word one day comes and tells
[1:12:59] you, you're sons and daughters of God
[1:13:01] called of Almighty God from before the
[1:13:03] foundation of the world. You've been
[1:13:05] washed. You've been cleansed. You've
[1:13:07] been sanctified. You've been filled with
[1:13:09] the Holy Ghost. My brother and sister,
[1:13:11] you say, "Thank you, Lord, that the word
[1:13:14] has come forth." But when the word comes
[1:13:16] and says that sin, like a flood has
[1:13:18] creeped up to your house, we get the
[1:13:20] idea it's like a tsunami sweeping
[1:13:23] through the window, tearing everything
[1:13:25] up. But when the word comes and says
[1:13:27] that he would come like a flood,
[1:13:30] sometimes the flood just rises so slowly
[1:13:34] &gt;&gt; and just creeps in under the door. Amen.
[1:13:37] &gt;&gt; And around.
[1:13:38] &gt;&gt; I got it.
[1:13:39] &gt;&gt; And when it's all done, the water is
[1:13:42] still in the house.
[1:13:44] &gt;&gt; Sin is still in the house.
[1:13:47] Whether it ripped the porch off,
[1:13:50] terrified you, or it just come really,
[1:13:54] really slow.
[1:13:58] When it has invaded your house, the
[1:14:00] house of God, temple of the Holy Ghost,
[1:14:04] &gt;&gt; it's still a flood.
[1:14:06] But God said, "You know what? When that
[1:14:08] comes, I'm going to raise up a
[1:14:10] standard."
[1:14:11] &gt;&gt; Now, my brother and sister, what is that
[1:14:12] standard? Feel free if you want to
[1:14:14] answer it, speak out. What is that
[1:14:15] standard?
[1:14:20] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:14:23] The word always comes and rises up. Now
[1:14:28] I want you to understand we get the idea
[1:14:30] that when Satan would come in like a
[1:14:32] flood that God raises a standard and it
[1:14:36] never touches us.
[1:14:38] &gt;&gt; But I want to tell you when the flood
[1:14:40] comes you can get your feet wet.
[1:14:43] &gt;&gt; Are you with me?
[1:14:44] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:14:46] &gt;&gt; You can get your feet wet,
[1:14:49] &gt;&gt; but the word doesn't abandon you.
[1:14:52] The word causes you to move to higher
[1:14:54] ground. The word causes you to go into a
[1:14:57] higher place. Amen. It doesn't allow
[1:15:01] your life to be destroyed
[1:15:04] because you see this word is coming to
[1:15:06] pass that it is here
[1:15:09] that it would come as a diverse
[1:15:12] temptation. Come as something that you
[1:15:16] struggle and say why
[1:15:20] you know why God's moving you to higher
[1:15:23] ground.
[1:15:24] Would it be safe for me to say, maybe
[1:15:27] this is just me, if you don't mind, I'll
[1:15:28] just put it out there,
[1:15:31] that every moment of spiritual growth
[1:15:34] has come after a moment of spiritual
[1:15:38] battle.
[1:15:40] We do not grow spiritually just because
[1:15:43] we got up in the morning and we felt
[1:15:45] like, bingo, I've got it.
[1:15:49] Spiritual growth comes right after you
[1:15:51] slug it out with the devil and you stand
[1:15:54] on the word and confess the word. And as
[1:15:58] you confess that word and you live that
[1:16:00] word, you hold on to that word for dear
[1:16:02] life. All of a sudden, you realize, you
[1:16:04] know what? Next time this comes into my
[1:16:06] life, I know how to deal with this. This
[1:16:09] is how the bride is overcoming, my
[1:16:10] brother and sister. Not God giving you a
[1:16:12] get out of jail free card. God is going
[1:16:15] to make you work for it. God is going to
[1:16:17] make you have a prayer life. He's going
[1:16:20] to make you have a a uh study the word
[1:16:23] life. Amen. He's going to make you come
[1:16:25] to the place that you have your
[1:16:27] priorities right. We're not going to
[1:16:29] just keep collecting get out of jail
[1:16:31] free cards. Young people and old, you
[1:16:34] need to realize God is not going to let
[1:16:37] you just fill your bookcase full of the
[1:16:40] message
[1:16:41] and say, "We've got the message. God
[1:16:44] sent a prophet. All is well, my brother
[1:16:46] and sister, as it is, he is telling us
[1:16:49] through the word, this very word that I
[1:16:52] revealed to you. And as it comes out,
[1:16:54] I'm jumping around a little bit. I'm I'm
[1:16:56] trying to skip a page in my mind, and
[1:16:58] it's hard, but it's there, my brother
[1:17:00] and sister. You see, the prophet said,
[1:17:01] "In this age, in this time, at the end
[1:17:04] of the age, amen, all the mystery of God
[1:17:09] will be revealed."
[1:17:11] We're not to move on as status quo, my
[1:17:14] brother and sister. Now, look at
[1:17:15] science. Look at at the good side of
[1:17:18] science. Amen. Every day, they're
[1:17:20] finding out new things. They're
[1:17:22] discovering little things about how, you
[1:17:24] know, our body uh processes things and
[1:17:27] how the cells work and what impact it is
[1:17:30] on us. And and my brother and sister,
[1:17:32] all of these things taking place, it is
[1:17:35] there. Some of this science is good.
[1:17:37] Some of this science is just a waste of
[1:17:39] science. But it's there that as God is
[1:17:41] working now, my brother and sister, I
[1:17:43] don't know about you guys, but uh we're
[1:17:45] certainly not the oldest people here,
[1:17:47] but you know, at this stage of my life
[1:17:49] and my health condition and different
[1:17:52] things like that, I suddenly woke up one
[1:17:55] day and says, "Man, I wished I'd have
[1:17:56] been taking my vitamins my whole life."
[1:18:00] Yeah,
[1:18:02] &gt;&gt; we did blood test on you, Paul. And
[1:18:05] that's lacking. I hope you catch the
[1:18:07] connection. That's lacking. That's
[1:18:10] lacking. That's lacking. Oh, finally at
[1:18:14] the end of the list. Oh, here's one
[1:18:15] thing that your body's good. The other
[1:18:17] 30 things are lacking
[1:18:20] here. Can anybody volunteer for a blood
[1:18:22] test this morning? Amen. That it would
[1:18:25] tell us what is lacking? Don't you
[1:18:28] actually wish that was the case? I could
[1:18:30] just sister, you know, you wouldn't want
[1:18:32] me with a needle in my hand. But anyway,
[1:18:35] but you know, we just
[1:18:38] Oh, this is lacking in your life. Here,
[1:18:42] take this bottle of faith.
[1:18:45] Take two a day. No, you're lacking. Take
[1:18:49] three a day.
[1:18:51] You know, I'm just going to be
[1:18:52] transparent. Sister Jerry's like, "I I
[1:18:55] got something for you to take." And I'm
[1:18:57] like, "Oh, what is this?"
[1:19:00] It's for people with ADD.
[1:19:04] Squirrel. Now, what were you talking
[1:19:05] about?
[1:19:08] And when I realized this going to help
[1:19:09] me not have squirrel moments, she's
[1:19:12] like, "No, you can't eat the whole
[1:19:13] bottle of them in one day. They actually
[1:19:17] are gummies and they taste good." You
[1:19:19] know, it's like if one gummy is good,
[1:19:22] two should be better. And I want to get
[1:19:24] over my squirrel moments like right now.
[1:19:27] I just
[1:19:29] But that isn't how it works, my brother
[1:19:31] and sister. We're not here as Christians
[1:19:33] to binge into the word. We're here to
[1:19:36] day by day realize without this in my
[1:19:41] life, I'll wake up one day lacking.
[1:19:45] I won't have this.
[1:19:49] Let me put it this way. I was just
[1:19:51] reading a little case of a young man
[1:19:53] that got in a lot of trouble with the
[1:19:55] law.
[1:19:56] I think he was about 35 years old. And
[1:19:59] it was when he got in trouble with the
[1:20:01] law that his own father realized his
[1:20:03] shortcomings and went
[1:20:06] and started to do his best to be a
[1:20:10] father.
[1:20:12] And the dad had expectation that after a
[1:20:14] few months of being a real father, it
[1:20:16] would unwind the years of neglect to the
[1:20:20] son.
[1:20:22] And ultimately one day he catches a
[1:20:24] revelation.
[1:20:26] I need to the rest of my life be a
[1:20:30] father. That's the only way I'll fix it.
[1:20:32] I can't give it in six months.
[1:20:37] But he also come to another conclusion
[1:20:38] that if I had been doing this the whole
[1:20:40] life, maybe this wouldn't be like it is.
[1:20:44] See, my brother and sister, you can't
[1:20:46] binge on the word of God and think
[1:20:48] you're going to undo all the days of
[1:20:50] neglect in your spiritual life. What you
[1:20:53] can do is start and take your spiritual
[1:20:57] vitamin every single day. And it will
[1:21:01] take time, but you will correct the
[1:21:04] deficiency.
[1:21:06] Amen. You don't go from not praying at
[1:21:08] all to a faithful, solid prayer life in
[1:21:12] one day. Amen. You'll find that every
[1:21:14] excuse that worked for 20 years will
[1:21:17] still be there trying to keep you today.
[1:21:19] But what you can do is press through
[1:21:21] that and say, "You know what? This is
[1:21:23] what I need to do." Amen. I think
[1:21:26] vitamins are a perfect example. And you
[1:21:28] know, maybe there might be some here
[1:21:29] this morning that that just
[1:21:31] automatically just faithfully take your
[1:21:33] vitamins, but most people I know need
[1:21:36] reminders to take their vitamins. Did I
[1:21:39] take my vitamins or did I not? Amen. So,
[1:21:42] what do they do? They build these little
[1:21:43] things there that have Monday through
[1:21:46] Sunday on them and you fill it full of
[1:21:48] vitamins. You know, some of you are
[1:21:50] smiling. You know what I'm talking
[1:21:51] about. Why? because you'll get where you
[1:21:54] at the end of the day can't remember
[1:21:56] whether you took your vitamins or not.
[1:21:58] And it's there that God says, "I want to
[1:22:00] meet you in the morning is when I want
[1:22:02] to meet you. I don't want to meet you
[1:22:03] when the day is over and everything has
[1:22:06] swamped your mind. I want to meet you in
[1:22:08] the morning." And then you don't have to
[1:22:10] worry about whether you met me or not.
[1:22:14] &gt;&gt; Amen. Because you've come. But you see,
[1:22:17] every day you don't take your vitamins.
[1:22:18] It takes two days worth of vitamins to
[1:22:20] cure the day you didn't take your
[1:22:22] vitamins. Could we apply that in our
[1:22:24] spiritual life?
[1:22:31] Now, Brother Brandon puts it this way.
[1:22:35] Study the message. I don't have a
[1:22:36] particular sermon that he put it in, but
[1:22:39] he talks about how the prescription
[1:22:41] won't do any good as long as it stays in
[1:22:43] the bottle. Right? So, you have to take
[1:22:47] the medicine.
[1:22:50] Amen. Because if it's still in the
[1:22:51] bottle, it's not doing you a bit of
[1:22:53] good. And I want to say this this very
[1:22:56] straightforward this morning. I hope
[1:22:58] this is not offensive. But if you're
[1:23:00] just sitting here saying, "I'm a message
[1:23:02] believer." Your medicine is still in the
[1:23:04] bottle. Amen. There's nothing to be
[1:23:06] proven by saying, "I'm a message
[1:23:08] believer." People, I believe a message
[1:23:10] for 40 years, 50 years, 60 years. My
[1:23:12] brother and sister, I want to know, have
[1:23:14] you taken it out of the Bible and
[1:23:16] applied it to your life? Because the
[1:23:18] devil has believed this is the truth
[1:23:20] from the very foundation, the very
[1:23:23] beginning. Amen. When before actually we
[1:23:26] recognize Satan had fallen, it was
[1:23:28] already something in him that he thought
[1:23:30] that he had a better idea than God did.
[1:23:33] He thought that I can present this
[1:23:34] better. I could do that. I could be more
[1:23:36] attractive. I'm more beautiful. And it
[1:23:38] was there, my brother and sister, that
[1:23:40] he never took the actual gospel of Jesus
[1:23:43] Christ before that. He never took that
[1:23:46] and applied it to himself. It was always
[1:23:48] applied to someone else. And he come and
[1:23:50] what he ended up was a case of spiritual
[1:23:53] amnesia. And it's there, my brother and
[1:23:56] sister, you'll find that we're living in
[1:23:57] a day that it's so easy to say, "I'll
[1:24:00] pray later. I'll read my Bible later.
[1:24:03] I'll do this later. I'll lift people up.
[1:24:05] I'll pray for others later.
[1:24:08] But that's just a case of amnesia.
[1:24:12] So let's get it out of the bottle. Amen.
[1:24:14] Let's take the medicine and then we'll
[1:24:17] find ourselves not lacking.
[1:24:20] But we have to get it out of the bottle.
[1:24:23] Now, brother Brown says in the message,
[1:24:25] India trip report.
[1:24:28] This is where
[1:24:31] my title comes from. in essence. Now, we
[1:24:35] know that it's nice to have churches.
[1:24:37] That's wonderful. We know it's nice to
[1:24:40] have denominations. That they're
[1:24:42] wonderful. It's nice to have seminaries.
[1:24:45] It's wonderful. But Christ never told us
[1:24:47] to build any seminary or anything like
[1:24:49] that. He said, "Preach the gospel." And
[1:24:52] the gospel isn't the word only.
[1:25:00] &gt;&gt; Come on.
[1:25:01] &gt;&gt; Come on, man. This can be a dead letter
[1:25:03] to you.
[1:25:06] &gt;&gt; But through power and manifestation of
[1:25:08] the Holy Spirit. Now, this word
[1:25:10] manifestation is an action.
[1:25:14] It's a conversion taking place that it's
[1:25:17] coming off the page and actually being
[1:25:20] brought to life.
[1:25:22] And you and I, my brother and sister,
[1:25:23] are being brought to life.
[1:25:25] &gt;&gt; Amen. We're not the old dead people that
[1:25:28] we were when God first started dealing
[1:25:29] with us. We're being brought to life.
[1:25:31] He's bringing manifestation in us. Would
[1:25:35] produce the signs of Mark 16 when he
[1:25:38] said, "Go ye into all the world, preach
[1:25:40] the gospel to every creature. These
[1:25:42] signs shall follow them." Amen. Now,
[1:25:45] look at this. This next line, the word
[1:25:47] itself is dead.
[1:25:50] But he didn't put a period there until
[1:25:53] it becomes into action and produces
[1:25:56] life. You see, we can have all the Bible
[1:25:58] we want.
[1:26:00] &gt;&gt; We can have all the prayers we want, but
[1:26:02] if you never put it in action, it's
[1:26:05] actually dead to you.
[1:26:11] &gt;&gt; Reminds me of a story I read. It was a
[1:26:12] young man. It was talking about his the
[1:26:16] transformation of his own life. And he
[1:26:19] said he was just like everybody else
[1:26:21] that was in their Bible study group,
[1:26:24] their youth group at the church and
[1:26:27] they're there and the instructor is
[1:26:29] talking about how you need to do this
[1:26:32] and you need to do that and this is what
[1:26:34] it'll take to be a good Christian. And
[1:26:36] one of the young men in that group at
[1:26:39] the just seemingly right time says to
[1:26:42] the instructor, "Do you do this?"
[1:26:49] And the instructor had to admit, "No, I
[1:26:53] don't."
[1:26:55] This young man realized just having the
[1:26:58] class, just having the study guide, just
[1:27:01] having the Bible didn't produce what the
[1:27:06] Bible and the study guide said it would.
[1:27:10] &gt;&gt; It had to be put in action. This young
[1:27:13] man actually went on to become a pastor.
[1:27:16] But right there in that uh little group,
[1:27:19] he actually just presented an innocent,
[1:27:22] honest approach and says, "Okay, so none
[1:27:25] of us in this group are doing this.
[1:27:27] What's stopping us? Can't we do this?"
[1:27:30] And they started to be serious about
[1:27:32] what they read and what they talked
[1:27:35] about. And they started applying it. and
[1:27:38] they actually started to actually really
[1:27:40] truly pray, really study their Bible.
[1:27:42] And he says the transformation amongst
[1:27:44] these kids was young people was
[1:27:47] incredible. You know what, my brother
[1:27:48] and sister, I hope I don't certainly
[1:27:50] hope I don't offend anybody here, but my
[1:27:52] brother and sister, we live in a day
[1:27:54] right now that people are faithful in
[1:27:56] church. They're faithful in Bible study.
[1:27:58] They drink, they do drugs, they dance,
[1:28:00] they're they're promiscuous, they do all
[1:28:02] these things and say they're a
[1:28:04] Christian. I'm telling you that word has
[1:28:07] never manifested off the page and become
[1:28:10] real to them or they couldn't be that
[1:28:13] kind of a person. I hope that didn't
[1:28:15] offend any of you. You can't be smoking
[1:28:17] pot and say you really have a revelation
[1:28:20] of who Jesus Christ is. Amen. He told
[1:28:22] you not to put any evil thing into your
[1:28:24] body. Amen. He told you not to do a lot
[1:28:27] of things. But you see, as long as it
[1:28:29] stays on that page, it doesn't affect
[1:28:31] us. We say, "I'm a Christian." What is
[1:28:33] that, my brother and sister? That's no
[1:28:35] more than being 10 generations from the
[1:28:38] original homeland and say, "I'm Greek
[1:28:41] and I'm Italian and I'm French and I'm
[1:28:44] whatever." My brother and sister, not
[1:28:46] so. It's got to be real. It's got to be
[1:28:48] current. It's got to be alive. It's got
[1:28:50] to be something that you can reach out
[1:28:52] and tangibly take a hold of today. And
[1:28:55] if we're going to sit here today and
[1:28:56] say, "I'm a message believer." Then
[1:28:58] let's have the message in our hand.
[1:29:00] Let's have the message in our heart.
[1:29:02] Let's have it in our mouth. Let's be
[1:29:04] eating the message, breathing the
[1:29:06] message, living the message. Otherwise,
[1:29:09] we've just hung some kind of a title on
[1:29:11] oursel and said, "I'm this." If we're
[1:29:13] going to do that, I'm going to stand up
[1:29:15] today. I hope you don't mind me using
[1:29:16] such a silly example. I'm rich.
[1:29:21] &gt;&gt; Or maybe I could say, I'm needy. Give me
[1:29:25] your money.
[1:29:29] Or maybe you could stand and say like a
[1:29:31] craziness of this day.
[1:29:34] You know, I'm going to share something
[1:29:35] silly with you. I don't know why I'm
[1:29:37] doing this, but my son, my my
[1:29:40] granddaughter
[1:29:42] in her classes, there was a young girl
[1:29:44] started showing up to school with this
[1:29:47] little I don't even know what you call
[1:29:48] it, plastic thing that clips on your
[1:29:50] head. You girls use them. Hold your hair
[1:29:52] back.
[1:29:53] No. Well, the plastic, you know, ding
[1:29:55] ding, whatever. had ears on it
[1:29:59] and she was wearing a belt that had a
[1:30:01] tail. And she would tie these things on
[1:30:04] her tennis shoes that looked like paws.
[1:30:08] And she'd tell everybody at school,
[1:30:10] teachers, principles, everybody, I'm a
[1:30:12] wolf.
[1:30:15] Well, this went on for a few months.
[1:30:20] One day when that little girl came home
[1:30:22] from school,
[1:30:24] her daddy had been shopping
[1:30:28] and he had a little cooler there with a
[1:30:30] little lunch meat throwed in it, little
[1:30:32] cheese, some water,
[1:30:35] and he says, "Sweetheart, we're going to
[1:30:37] go for a drive."
[1:30:40] They drove up into the white tanks out
[1:30:43] behind Phoenix there. If you're familiar
[1:30:45] with that area, you'd know where I'm
[1:30:46] talking about. They found this spot
[1:30:48] right there and the dad starts unloading
[1:30:51] things and he says, "I know this doesn't
[1:30:52] fit perfectly, honey." But the dad sets
[1:30:55] up a tank, throws a a tent, throws a
[1:30:57] sleeping bag inside. It's got a cooler
[1:30:59] with a little lunch meat and puts it
[1:31:01] down there. And the little girl's like,
[1:31:03] "Dad,
[1:31:05] what's what's going on, honey? Wolves
[1:31:09] don't live in houses. Wolves don't have
[1:31:11] cell phones. They don't sleep on
[1:31:13] mattresses. Wolves live in the wild.
[1:31:15] They sleep on the ground and you're a
[1:31:18] wolf.
[1:31:21] She stood there a few minutes. She
[1:31:23] turned to her daddy and says, "Dad,"
[1:31:25] he's like, "What, honey?
[1:31:28] I'm not a wolf anymore."
[1:31:32] Now, my brother and sister, you say,
[1:31:33] "Brother Paul, what are you trying to
[1:31:34] get at? I don't care what Satan's tried
[1:31:36] to convince you. You are. You are sons
[1:31:39] and daughters of God." Amen. We are not
[1:31:42] to live in a garbage dump. We're not to
[1:31:45] eat garbage. We're kings. We're children
[1:31:47] of the king. Let's live like we're
[1:31:50] children of the king. Amen. Not
[1:31:53] immersing ourselves in the in the
[1:31:54] garbage dump. my daughter, my
[1:31:56] granddaughter Aaliyah, she showed me a
[1:31:58] little mime and it's here it's a deal
[1:32:00] and and they're holding up two pictures
[1:32:03] and and uh uh one is just all this trash
[1:32:06] and banana peels that are turning brown
[1:32:08] and and just ugly and another one and
[1:32:10] they said one of these pictures is your
[1:32:13] room and the other one's a garbage dump
[1:32:15] and they're like which one's which and
[1:32:17] they said well this one's my room and
[1:32:19] they said they're both your room.
[1:32:22] &gt;&gt; What is it, my brother and sister? We
[1:32:24] sometimes think our world is tidier than
[1:32:27] maybe God looks at it and sees a lot of
[1:32:30] trash
[1:32:32] laying around.
[1:32:34] I'm not being too hard on you this
[1:32:36] morning, am I?
[1:32:37] &gt;&gt; You see, what God wants us to do, my
[1:32:39] brother and sister, is realize it's
[1:32:41] going to take more than just the word.
[1:32:44] &gt;&gt; You're not going to have a Bible. You
[1:32:46] can have so many Bibles, you can't store
[1:32:48] them all. Amen. You can have everything
[1:32:51] you need. You can have the message. You
[1:32:53] can have preaching. You can have
[1:32:55] beautiful gospel music. You can have all
[1:32:57] of that and be just as lost as lost is
[1:33:00] lost.
[1:33:02] &gt;&gt; Because it takes more than just the
[1:33:03] word. It takes the spirit. Amen. It
[1:33:06] takes the Holy Spirit coming down. Now,
[1:33:09] my brother and sister, and the gospel
[1:33:11] isn't word only, only through power and
[1:33:14] manifestation of the Holy Spirit, which
[1:33:16] would produce the signs of Mark 16 when
[1:33:19] he said, "Go ye into the world and
[1:33:21] preach the gospel to every creature."
[1:33:22] these signs shall follow them. And the
[1:33:25] word itself is dead until it becomes
[1:33:28] into action and produces life. And
[1:33:31] except a corn of wheat fall into the
[1:33:33] ground, it abides alone. And then when
[1:33:35] the word is brought into the heart of
[1:33:38] faith, an action taking place. Amen.
[1:33:41] Maybe you could lift a hand and say,
[1:33:42] "Lord, let my heart be a heart of
[1:33:44] faith." Amen. I I don't want it to just
[1:33:46] be an old stony heart. I don't want it
[1:33:48] to be just an intellectual heart. I want
[1:33:51] it to be a heart of faith. It makes
[1:33:53] every promise in the Bible live again.
[1:33:56] See, it it's got to live. It's
[1:33:58] germatized word. It It's a germatized
[1:34:02] word, and it must live if it's received
[1:34:05] in the right place, under the right
[1:34:06] condition. Every seed will live again.
[1:34:09] If it's put under the right condition.
[1:34:11] Now, my brother and sister, I'll tell
[1:34:12] you, for this word to live today, you
[1:34:14] and I are going to have to put it in the
[1:34:17] right condition. Amen. That's not an old
[1:34:19] filthy life. That's not just living on
[1:34:22] the borderland. It's not just a
[1:34:24] compromise. It is actually standing on
[1:34:27] the word of God with no compromise.
[1:34:30] &gt;&gt; Oh my. And people say, "But I can't live
[1:34:33] it." Yes, you can. You're listening to
[1:34:35] the devil. If you think you can't live
[1:34:36] it, you're listening to the devil. Amen.
[1:34:38] Shut the devil out. The word of God said
[1:34:41] you can live it. You can do this. Now,
[1:34:44] look, this is a germatized word. So that
[1:34:47] means the life has already been brought
[1:34:49] to life inside of that seed,
[1:34:53] &gt;&gt; but it needs the right condition.
[1:34:57] &gt;&gt; Needs the right location. It needs the
[1:34:59] right atmosphere.
[1:35:02] You see my brother and sister, I look at
[1:35:04] this.
[1:35:06] I love this message.
[1:35:08] Yeah. Sometimes it's hard on my flesh. I
[1:35:10] read things, hear things that I'm just
[1:35:12] cringe like, "Oh, Lord, help me." But
[1:35:15] you see, I have over the years collected
[1:35:19] box after box of books,
[1:35:22] message books.
[1:35:24] And when you thumb through those, I
[1:35:26] don't bring them here to the church and
[1:35:27] give them out because there's there's
[1:35:30] names, people's names written in there,
[1:35:33] uh people's ideas, notes, thoughts
[1:35:35] underlined, and and you just don't
[1:35:38] present that in such a way that that it
[1:35:41] influences others of what somebody has
[1:35:43] focused on.
[1:35:45] But my brother and sister, all these
[1:35:48] boxes of books have someone else's name
[1:35:50] inside the fly.
[1:35:54] They had the message.
[1:35:57] They had a revealed word for the hour,
[1:36:00] but they didn't have the spirit.
[1:36:03] And these people are not rude,
[1:36:06] horrible people. They're people that
[1:36:08] just said, "Paul, I can't live this, and
[1:36:11] I can't bring myself to throw this away.
[1:36:13] Would you like that?
[1:36:17] I had one individual give me literally
[1:36:19] boxes of material because he said, "I
[1:36:22] can't bring myself to throw it away, but
[1:36:25] I can't bring myself to live it either."
[1:36:30] &gt;&gt; You talk about being in a limbo.
[1:36:34] It's enough truth to them that they
[1:36:36] can't just disrespect it to throw it
[1:36:37] away, but it's not alive enough to
[1:36:41] actually want to live it. Acknowledge
[1:36:43] it. God is good. God's a savior. God's a
[1:36:46] healer. Why don't you prove it?
[1:36:49] &gt;&gt; Let your life prove it.
[1:36:54] Now,
[1:36:59] let me move forward. There's a beautiful
[1:37:01] quote, but time is so fleeting.
[1:37:04] Yeah, what's time? It is fleeting.
[1:37:08] In the first seal,
[1:37:11] exactly what it done. That's what Daniel
[1:37:13] said this Antichrist would do. He would
[1:37:15] fit the people's place. Yes, it'll fit
[1:37:20] their menu for this day for the
[1:37:22] churches. For in this church age, they
[1:37:24] don't want the word Christ, but they
[1:37:27] want church. The first thing they don't
[1:37:30] ask you if you're a Christian, what
[1:37:33] church you belong to.
[1:37:38] Now, we could segregate it. wouldn't it
[1:37:39] be really weird if we come today? And I
[1:37:42] said, "Hey, you know what? We want to
[1:37:44] just kind of have a couple boundaries
[1:37:46] around the place here. Um, why don't all
[1:37:50] the farmers
[1:37:52] come over here and and stand with me?"
[1:37:59] See, Sister Jerry doesn't even consider
[1:38:01] herself to be a farmer.
[1:38:05] She says, "I married a carpenter. I
[1:38:07] didn't marry a farmer.
[1:38:13] Oh, all of you that make a living doing
[1:38:16] this, come over here.
[1:38:19] You know what? We'd end up
[1:38:22] just maybe a few at most in a little
[1:38:24] group. And otherwise, all of us would
[1:38:26] almost be completely separated in our
[1:38:28] fellowship. Right, brother Adam? How
[1:38:31] many drywallers are there in the church?
[1:38:34] Two.
[1:38:37] Amen. Father, son.
[1:38:40] Oh, how how many of you work with stone?
[1:38:44] Pretty limited number.
[1:38:47] How many of you do this?
[1:38:50] Pretty limited number.
[1:38:52] How many of you are students? Probably
[1:38:55] the biggest group in the whole in the
[1:38:57] whole group here still trying to learn.
[1:38:59] But you see, I could come and step over
[1:39:02] here with the students and say, even at
[1:39:04] 63 years old, I'm still learning. So
[1:39:07] therefore, I identify as a student,
[1:39:11] but would the students really accept me
[1:39:12] as a student?
[1:39:15] Imagine now the church goes on to
[1:39:17] function with all these little groups.
[1:39:20] silly analogy, but I want you to
[1:39:22] understand that when we come and we're
[1:39:24] not identified in Jesus Christ, we're
[1:39:27] identified in I believe this part of the
[1:39:30] message. I believe this part of the
[1:39:32] message, I believe this part of the
[1:39:34] message, I'm Baptist, I'm Nazarene, I'm
[1:39:36] Methodist. You see what we're doing? We
[1:39:39] just separate the fellowship and there's
[1:39:41] no real joining together anywhere in
[1:39:44] this. This is what the prophet of God's
[1:39:45] talking about. Oh, what church you
[1:39:47] belong to? What church? They don't want
[1:39:49] Christ the word. You tell them about the
[1:39:51] word and how to straighten up and they
[1:39:53] don't want that. They want something and
[1:39:55] just live any old way they want to. I
[1:39:57] hope this doesn't apply to you guys.
[1:39:59] Amen. And still belong to church and
[1:40:01] obtain their testimony. See? See, he
[1:40:04] fits the menu just exactly. And
[1:40:06] remember, he's finally called she in the
[1:40:08] Bible. And she was a prostitute and had
[1:40:11] daughters. Just fits the bill of the
[1:40:13] day. What the people wants. There it is.
[1:40:16] God has promised it when the word is
[1:40:19] refused, when they are turned to their
[1:40:22] desires. Let's read Thessalonians again.
[1:40:24] He said, I want you to catch or watch
[1:40:27] here uh just a minute. Well, we read it
[1:40:29] a while ago. 2 Thessalonians 2:9-11. It
[1:40:33] said that they would turn down, reject
[1:40:35] the truth, they'd be given over to a
[1:40:37] reprobate mind and would believe a lie
[1:40:40] and would be damned by it. Now, that's
[1:40:42] what the Holy Spirit said. Now, isn't
[1:40:45] that the desire of the church today? You
[1:40:47] try to tell people that they have to do
[1:40:49] this, that, or the other, and they'll
[1:40:51] let you know right quick that they are
[1:40:52] Methodist, Presbyterian, or whatever,
[1:40:54] and they don't have to paddle in your
[1:40:56] boat.
[1:40:58] See what's happened? We've moved away,
[1:41:00] and we've segregated
[1:41:03] because it's not the Holy Spirit leading
[1:41:05] the church any longer. It's identity.
[1:41:09] Yeah,
[1:41:11] &gt;&gt; you guys are looking at me like, and the
[1:41:14] point is,
[1:41:17] man, those of you nodded your head at
[1:41:18] that, I'm offended.
[1:41:21] You realize, my brother and sister, this
[1:41:24] word, Amen, will not change you. You'll
[1:41:29] read it. You'll read it. You'll read it.
[1:41:31] It takes a moving of the Holy Spirit.
[1:41:36] It takes the Holy Spirit coming down in
[1:41:38] your life, in my life. It takes more
[1:41:41] than just the word.
[1:41:44] &gt;&gt; Cuz the word is sitting on the shelf of
[1:41:46] many a person today that will not go to
[1:41:49] church, will not pray, will not read
[1:41:51] their Bible, will not do every attribute
[1:41:54] of what a Christian does, but they've
[1:41:56] got the word but no spirit. Amen. What
[1:42:01] God wants you and I to do, he has given
[1:42:03] us the word. The word has come. It's
[1:42:05] here. What he wants you and I to do is
[1:42:07] get in the spirit.
[1:42:09] &gt;&gt; He wants us to come to the place that we
[1:42:11] want to be in his presence so much
[1:42:15] that above all else, we want to be in
[1:42:17] that because the spirit, my brother and
[1:42:19] sister, the spirit is what giveth life.
[1:42:22] Now, I want to just move forward real
[1:42:24] quick. Amen. Just real quick. People
[1:42:28] pack the same Bible as you, maybe go to
[1:42:30] the same church as you. They sing. They
[1:42:33] raise their hands. Amen.
[1:42:38] But you see, brother Brown says in the
[1:42:41] sermon, God has identified the same in
[1:42:43] all generations. Uh
[1:42:47] that we'll see what the word is by what
[1:42:49] has been made manifest.
[1:42:52] Now, I would say by and large overall,
[1:42:56] don't mean to be presumptuous, but we're
[1:42:57] here because we believe this is truth.
[1:43:00] We're here today with a belief.
[1:43:04] That belief should have action
[1:43:07] connected to it. If what you're living
[1:43:11] doesn't line up with the word, don't
[1:43:13] toss the word out. Change your life.
[1:43:17] &gt;&gt; Amen. That's all it takes. My brother
[1:43:19] and sister, I'll close. Sister Vika,
[1:43:21] would you just come? But I I want to put
[1:43:23] this, my brother and sister, to to you
[1:43:25] today. I felt led to preach this. This
[1:43:27] is where we're at. But you realize when
[1:43:29] it comes to navigation,
[1:43:32] you're in an airplane. You're over the
[1:43:34] Atlantic Ocean.
[1:43:37] Your navigation is off by a half a
[1:43:40] degree. Doesn't seem like much. If I put
[1:43:44] a pin right here and I go to the back of
[1:43:48] this building, a half a degree off, it's
[1:43:51] not even hardly going to be noticeable.
[1:43:54] But when you're talking about an
[1:43:57] airplane, true story here. Amen. Back in
[1:44:01] the days before GPS and all this, flying
[1:44:03] across the Atlantic Ocean and the
[1:44:04] navigator cloud cover, he got one
[1:44:07] glimpse and he took a reading with his
[1:44:09] sextant and and he did that, but his
[1:44:11] reading was off by approximately a half
[1:44:13] a degree. They had to land on the Azors
[1:44:18] to get fuel to continue their flight. Do
[1:44:21] you know what the Azors is? In all
[1:44:23] reality, it's this one little blip in
[1:44:26] the middle of the Atlantic Ocean. Just a
[1:44:28] blip. And when they get to the point
[1:44:31] that all calculations say we should be
[1:44:33] at the Azors, there's nothing but water.
[1:44:37] That half a degree
[1:44:40] almost doomed them.
[1:44:43] But at that last minute, the pilot asked
[1:44:45] the navigator, "Go back on the chart.
[1:44:48] Look at it all again." And and the
[1:44:50] navigator says, "I think I see where it
[1:44:52] was, a half a degree calculated by a,000
[1:44:56] miles. Azors is 80 miles that
[1:45:00] direction." And the pilot says, "This is
[1:45:03] do or die." And he turns the plane and
[1:45:06] he goes that direction, that heading.
[1:45:08] You know how they rejoiced
[1:45:11] when that little speck in the middle of
[1:45:13] the Atlantic Ocean appeared in front of
[1:45:15] them?
[1:45:16] And when they put the landing gear down
[1:45:18] and they landed on that thing, grown men
[1:45:22] who had just been through a war sat in
[1:45:25] their planes and wept with the
[1:45:28] realization how close they came to
[1:45:32] missing it. My brother and sister,
[1:45:36] today I want to encourage you. Go back.
[1:45:40] Make sure you're not that half a degree
[1:45:42] off. Make sure that your life is lined
[1:45:45] up perfectly on the word of God because
[1:45:49] what will happen is when this life is
[1:45:52] over and we are faced with eternity,
[1:45:55] you're either going to be able to land
[1:45:57] as it were on that island
[1:46:01] or you're going to land in the middle of
[1:46:03] an endless ocean of sorrow, grief, and
[1:46:07] despair. See what God's trying to do?
[1:46:09] He's bringing this word. Not that you
[1:46:11] have to tow this mark. You have to tow
[1:46:14] that mark. It's the word. It's the word
[1:46:17] he wants you to line up with. It's the
[1:46:20] word he's trying to point us and draw us
[1:46:22] to. Anything that's not the word is a
[1:46:24] compromise. Anything that's not leading
[1:46:27] you into eternal life is a compromise, a
[1:46:30] mistake.
[1:46:33] Amen. That's why the word itself is not
[1:46:38] enough. We need the Holy Spirit to come
[1:46:41] into our lives, lead us and guide us,
[1:46:44] give us direction, correct us. Who likes
[1:46:47] to be corrected? You know, I think
[1:46:50] believers can lift a hand. Real
[1:46:51] Christians lift a hand and say, "I like
[1:46:53] to be corrected." But most of humanity
[1:46:56] doesn't like to be corrected.
[1:46:59] But a real believer says, "Lord, change
[1:47:02] my course.
[1:47:04] Lead me. Guide me to all truth. Lord,
[1:47:06] lead me, Father, so that I can come to
[1:47:09] the place and I land in your presence. I
[1:47:12] come and hear those words, "Well done,
[1:47:14] my good and faithful servant." We'll sit
[1:47:16] there and we'll weep. We'll be there and
[1:47:19] say, "Thank you, Lord. My life was off
[1:47:22] course, but you brought me on course,
[1:47:23] and you've brought me to this place. I'm
[1:47:26] saved. My life is complete."
[1:47:29] Oh, my brother and sister. Amen. Forgive
[1:47:32] me for my wondering. Amen. And forgive
[1:47:34] me for bouncing around all in these
[1:47:36] thoughts, but here we are. The Lord
[1:47:39] wants us not to just settle. We have the
[1:47:42] message. He wants us to have him. We
[1:47:46] need his Holy Spirit. We need him in
[1:47:49] control of our life. Lord, thy will, not
[1:47:52] my will be done. Hallelujah.
[1:47:56] Oh my.
[1:47:59] Amen.
[1:48:06] Let's just stand. Brother Alex, if
[1:48:08] you'll come.
[1:48:10] 405 Marvelous Grace.
[1:48:16] [Music]
[1:48:23] Marvelous
[1:48:25] grace of our loving
[1:48:30] Lord.
[1:48:32] A grace that exceeds
[1:48:37] our sin and our gift
[1:48:44] on Calary
[1:48:47] is mou
[1:48:49] [Music]
[1:48:52] there where the blood of the lamb
[1:48:59] was spilled.
[1:49:02] Grace,
[1:49:03] [Music]
[1:49:04] grace. Just thank him for that grace
[1:49:07] this morning.
[1:49:09] &gt;&gt; Grace,
[1:49:11] &gt;&gt; oh grace that will pardon
[1:49:15] all and cleanse
[1:49:18] with him.
[1:49:21] Grace,
[1:49:23] grace.
[1:49:25] God
[1:49:28] grace. Think about it.
[1:49:30] A grace that is greater than all
[1:49:37] our sin.
[1:49:40] Sin
[1:49:41] and despair like the sea
[1:49:46] waves cold
[1:49:49] threaten
[1:49:51] the soul
[1:49:53] with infinite
[1:49:58] grace that is greater. Yes. Grace
[1:50:05] untold
[1:50:08] points to the reuge the mighty
[1:50:15] cross.
[1:50:17] Grace.
[1:50:19] Grace.
[1:50:22] God's
[1:50:24] grace.
[1:50:26] Grace that will pardon and cleanse
[1:50:33] within
[1:50:36] grace.
[1:50:38] Grace
[1:50:40] God's
[1:50:43] grace.
[1:50:45] Grace that is greater
[1:50:49] than all
[1:50:51] our sin.
[1:50:55] Dark is the stain that we cannot
[1:51:02] hide.
[1:51:04] What can a veil
[1:51:08] to wash it away?
[1:51:13] Look, there is flowing
[1:51:18] a crimson
[1:51:20] tide,
[1:51:23] whiter than snow you may be
[1:51:29] today.
[1:51:32] Grace.
[1:51:34] Grace.
[1:51:36] God's
[1:51:39] grace.
