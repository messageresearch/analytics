[26:49] across your mind if there was ever a
[26:51] name you a person a name that you would

[28:07] tonight that we miss them

[28:12] it's pretty scary my brother and sister
[28:14] when people are married
[28:17] as long as i you expect to live
[28:21] so anyway um
[28:24] let's just stand and we'll go into the
[28:26] word this evening amen good to see
[28:29] grace and sister sophie tonight um
[28:33] our brother manasseh just texting with
[28:36] him a little bit
[28:37] and just remember him in prayer got a
[28:40] real heart
[28:41] wants to serve the lord amen we live in
[28:44] a day that satan would throw
[28:46] everything he's got out in front of us
[28:49] to distract us from serving him
[28:51] amen hallelujah let's turn to
[28:55] john uh preparations of the inner man
[28:58] i just want to talk to you tonight uh
[29:00] continuing on this thought
[29:02] uh deity has a dwelling place and
[29:05] this uh is just going to be a little
[29:08] foundational we'll actually backtrack a
[29:10] little bit
[29:11] in future services here i think just two
[29:14] or three to kind of cover
[29:16] uh this topic but uh we'll we'll go into
[29:19] the book of john tonight
[29:21] and it's quite a lengthy scripture
[29:23] reading so we'll read part of it and
[29:25] allow you to be seated
[29:27] amen hallelujah everybody got their
[29:30] sword tonight
[29:32] we live in electronic age you know and
[29:34] it's easy sometimes to say well i got my
[29:36] bible right here on my phone but
[29:38] it's just not the same amen we ought to
[29:41] be packing our sword
[29:43] everywhere we go electronics is it ought
[29:46] to be considered convenience you know
[29:48] like
[29:48] you're driving down the road and you
[29:50] want to read your bible
[29:53] you know stuff like that but it ought
[29:56] not be our primary thing
[29:58] it's just not the same to sit down in
[30:00] your chair in the evening or in the
[30:02] morning
[30:03] pick up your phone and read your bible
[30:05] they're proving
[30:06] that the amount that you remember is
[30:09] significantly less when read on a device
[30:12] than it is when your fingers actually
[30:14] touch the page
[30:16] oh my well i want to remember
[30:19] amen i don't want it to be convenient i
[30:22] want to be powerful
[30:24] and i want it to be alive amen
[30:27] john 14 and 1 let not your heart be
[30:30] troubled
[30:32] boy that's something the world's even
[30:34] talking about right now people
[30:35] are tore up amen
[30:39] that you're not let not your heart be
[30:40] troubled ye believe in god
[30:42] believe also in me in my father's house
[30:46] are
[30:47] many mansions if it were not so i would
[30:49] have told you
[30:50] i go to prepare a place for you and if i
[30:53] go and prepare a place for you
[30:55] i will come again and receive you unto
[30:58] myself
[30:59] that where i am there you may be also
[31:03] and whither i go ye no
[31:07] and the way ye know now this is
[31:09] interesting my brother and sister
[31:11] because thomas
[31:12] we always call him doubting thomas right
[31:14] just because he had a question
[31:16] but if that was the case put your name
[31:18] right behind doubting
[31:19] because we've all asked for a
[31:21] confirmation from god
[31:23] at some point in our life we we need the
[31:26] reassurance we're just
[31:27] mere humans we need that reassurance and
[31:30] so sometimes people like well that
[31:32] doubting thomas well
[31:34] hallelujah doubting paul doubting put
[31:36] your name there
[31:38] amen but look at this now
[31:41] jesus says whether i go ye know and the
[31:44] way
[31:45] ye know thomas said unto him lord
[31:48] we know not wither thou goest and how
[31:50] can we know
[31:51] the way you see
[31:54] it's a context you could say down
[31:56] through the scriptures
[31:58] that god has hid himself and the
[32:01] revelation of his word
[32:02] in plain sight see so it's not going to
[32:06] be intellectualism it's not going to be
[32:08] a seminary it's not going to be whatever
[32:11] that reveals christ to us and jesus
[32:14] is telling them you know see they've
[32:16] already heard it preached
[32:18] the background is already there the
[32:20] lights just got to be turned on
[32:22] oh thank you lord for turning on the
[32:23] light amen
[32:26] jesus saith unto him i am the way the
[32:29] truth and the life
[32:30] and no man cometh unto the father but by
[32:33] me
[32:34] if he had known me you should have known
[32:36] my father
[32:37] and from henceforth you know him and
[32:40] have seen him
[32:41] philip saith unto him lord show us the
[32:43] father
[32:44] and it sufficeth us jesus said unto him
[32:47] have i been so
[32:48] long time with you and yet hast thou
[32:52] not known me philip he that has seen
[32:55] me has seen the father and how sayeth
[32:58] thou
[32:59] then show us the father believeth thou
[33:02] not that i am in the father and the
[33:04] father
[33:04] in me the words that i speak unto you i
[33:07] speak not of myself
[33:09] but the father that dwelleth in me he
[33:12] doeth the works
[33:13] i believe verse 10 should be a testament
[33:16] to us today amen that it is not
[33:20] what we know it's not what it is but
[33:22] everything that we would speak
[33:24] everything that we would know would not
[33:26] be of ourself but it's the father that
[33:28] dwelleth in me
[33:30] he doeth the works amen you know about
[33:33] the
[33:33] time that we ever get to the point we
[33:35] think we're just doing pretty good in
[33:36] our spiritual walk have you ever noticed
[33:38] that right after you boast about what
[33:40] position you're in as a christian that
[33:43] that you get kind of
[33:44] run into a bad spot you might say you
[33:47] run into a place that you feel like
[33:49] you've let the lord down
[33:50] you've had troubles in your life maybe
[33:53] you say something that wasn't quite up
[33:55] to par
[33:56] and you realize my brother and sister
[33:58] that all that we
[33:59] are all that we can do every bit of
[34:02] fiber of
[34:03] our being is christ in us
[34:06] amen hallelujah he doeth the works
[34:09] believe me that i am in the father and
[34:11] the father in me
[34:12] or else believe me for the very work's
[34:14] sake verily verily i say unto you
[34:16] he that believeth on me the works that i
[34:18] do shall
[34:20] he do also and greater works than these
[34:22] shall he do
[34:23] because i go into my father amen we'll
[34:26] just
[34:27] bless the word and let you be seated
[34:29] heavenly father we just ask you this
[34:31] evening
[34:32] lord this time as i joked with my
[34:34] brother jason i didn't want to be too
[34:36] long tonight lord and i pray you would

[34:55] on the road or home
[34:57] lord just ask you to be with them in the
[34:59] name of jesus christ
[35:00] amen you may be seated saints
[35:03] amen you know i find it interesting i
[35:06] want to
[35:07] expand on verse 12 for just a moment
[35:10] amen that he says right here he that
[35:12] believeth on me the works that i do
[35:14] shall he do also so if we're believers
[35:18] tonight are we believers tonight
[35:19] amen so we should not settle for just
[35:23] some little token representation of
[35:26] having the holy ghost and the life he
[35:28] says the works that
[35:29] i do shall he do also we should stand up
[35:32] and say lord
[35:33] i i am ready i want to be prepared to do
[35:37] this work for you
[35:38] i need you lord to present me or prepare
[35:41] me
[35:42] in such a fashion lord that i can
[35:44] fulfill this scripture right here
[35:47] and he said greater works than these
[35:48] shall he do because i go
[35:50] in into my father and whatsoever ye
[35:53] shall ask in my name
[35:55] that will i do that the father may be
[35:57] glorified in the son
[35:59] and if she shall ask anything in my name
[36:02] i will do it
[36:03] if you love me keep my commandments amen
[36:06] i was just listening to a man on the
[36:08] radio yesterday
[36:09] and boy he was just tearing into it i i
[36:12] was actually
[36:12] quite surprised that uh a man of uh of
[36:16] uh the amount of coverage or exposure he
[36:19] has
[36:20] but he ripped into it and he said you
[36:21] know one of the problems we have
[36:23] is a weak pulpit we have this that the
[36:25] people got he nailed it right on the
[36:27] head
[36:28] he said the churches got so concerned
[36:30] about what they were doing their
[36:31] building programs their finery
[36:33] all of this stuff that they started
[36:35] watering down the gospel to keep the
[36:38] people coming
[36:39] and keep the ties pouring in and he says
[36:42] so what happened was as time went on
[36:44] the only way you can keep these people
[36:46] satisfied
[36:47] is to continue to water down the word of
[36:50] god
[36:51] hello i tell you my brother and sister
[36:52] if we get right down to just a little
[36:54] handful
[36:55] i say we stick with the original word of
[36:57] god we don't deviate we don't
[37:00] have to come to a place that we would
[37:01] water it down and then he went on to say
[37:04] he said
[37:04] the children they're out in these
[37:06] streets tearing it up the children that
[37:08] are
[37:08] rioting and doing all these behaviors he
[37:11] said
[37:12] we might blame the parents we might
[37:14] blame all kinds of things we might blame
[37:16] our schools
[37:17] but he said i'm going to squarely today
[37:19] place the blame on the preacher in the
[37:22] pulpit if he had continued to preach the
[37:24] truth
[37:25] and it held the standard and encouraged
[37:27] the people to hold the standard
[37:28] that there might be some families like
[37:30] the ortega children that have been out
[37:32] rioting in the streets
[37:36] you see there's a difference my brother
[37:37] and sister when you raise a family in
[37:39] the fear and admonition of the lord
[37:41] they have a desire to travel to the
[37:43] world amen
[37:45] and i'm giving a compliment to their
[37:47] children
[37:48] which i love very dearly they have more
[37:50] desire to go
[37:52] and share the gospel and live a good
[37:53] life than they are to go out and knock
[37:55] the windows out of your car and take the
[37:57] tires
[37:58] amen so you see it's all what we present
[38:00] before our children
[38:02] and when we come to the place my brother
[38:04] and sister that it comes right back
[38:06] and moves right up the chain of command
[38:08] you might say and comes and rests right
[38:10] at the pulpit
[38:11] well this this and gentlemen is not the
[38:13] only one
[38:14] not the first one and will not be the
[38:15] last one to declare that it's a weak
[38:18] pulpit that has caused many of the
[38:19] problems we have today
[38:21] amen you know there is a a bishop uh
[38:25] back east that's been in the news just a
[38:27] tad bit
[38:28] and and he he got up and now while we
[38:31] don't necessarily agree with the
[38:32] catholic church
[38:33] this man had a little fortitude had a
[38:35] little courage and got up and said
[38:38] that that we should not be supporting
[38:40] this we should not be
[38:41] giving encouragement to to the things
[38:44] that are happening in the
[38:45] the things that are being projected and
[38:47] the catholic church the local uh
[38:49] uh bishop or whatever of the diocese
[38:52] there overall
[38:53] has taken the man from his office and
[38:55] said i may well make it to where he can
[38:57] never
[38:58] ever be a priest over a church ever
[39:00] again you see my brother and sister
[39:02] it's not just the ungodly so to speak
[39:05] out here
[39:05] it's not the ones that are the heathen
[39:08] and they're the agnostic or the atheist
[39:10] you see
[39:10] it's invaded to the very core of what we
[39:12] call christianity
[39:14] amen and so as we look at this we
[39:16] recognize as we move forward today
[39:18] that deity must have a dwelling place
[39:22] amen
[39:23] and so as we look at this we'll
[39:25] recognize as
[39:26] jesus is speaking he's making this
[39:28] declaration to the people
[39:30] if you love me keep my commandments and
[39:33] i will pray the father
[39:34] and he shall give you another comforter
[39:37] that he may abide with you
[39:39] forever even the spirit of truth
[39:42] now my brother and sister we well know
[39:44] as bible i i would use the word
[39:46] scholar just because as christians we
[39:49] study the word of god
[39:50] uh every every bible reader would
[39:53] understand
[39:54] that what jesus was talking about was
[39:56] sending the holy spirit
[39:57] which is the very spirit of god sending
[40:00] it down as a comforter to the people
[40:02] but look how jesus right here in these
[40:04] words
[40:05] declares it as a spirit of truth
[40:09] see it's not just a presence that has
[40:11] come he didn't descend a comforter
[40:13] but it was a spirit of truth and when
[40:15] that comforter has come my brother and
[40:17] sister
[40:18] truth must surround it amen it cannot be
[40:21] something contrary to the word of god
[40:23] but it must be the very life that god
[40:26] has presented to us
[40:27] and our lord jesus christ come forth as
[40:30] a sacrificial lamb
[40:31] he made that sacrifice for us can we
[40:34] hold another standard
[40:35] and say that sacrifice was for us amen
[40:39] it is to take the liberty that we have
[40:41] as americans
[40:42] and say we want to be communists my
[40:44] brother and sister that's an oxymoron
[40:46] amen that is a paradox when people say
[40:49] well i want to take from you and give to
[40:51] me and we'll call that liberty
[40:53] no my brother and sister that's not what
[40:55] it is it is a bondage that is being
[40:58] brought
[40:58] and we can look at this and people will
[41:00] say well there is a
[41:02] a marxist movement uh antifa or whatever
[41:05] they pronounce that
[41:06] all of these movements here my brother
[41:08] and sister come on let's get right back
[41:10] the word of god shows us there's two
[41:12] spirits in the framework
[41:13] amen so these are not just a movement
[41:16] these are not
[41:17] it's either moving forward to serve god
[41:19] or it's tearing down and separating
[41:22] which is of satan amen so you see right
[41:25] here
[41:25] in the midst of our streets this might
[41:27] be a little strong forgive me if you
[41:28] feel it is
[41:29] but right in the midst of our street you
[41:31] are seeing not just
[41:32] misguided children but children anointed
[41:35] well they're not all children they
[41:36] arrested some 60 year old
[41:38] so you know it's it's all happening
[41:40] maybe he was an old hippie i don't know
[41:42] but you just you see my brother and
[41:44] sister what you have
[41:45] is the spirit of the antichrist right
[41:48] magnified
[41:49] walking the streets of our cities
[41:52] destroying
[41:54] and people say well they have a right to
[41:56] their opinion and that's right god gave
[41:58] satan the opportunity to voice
[42:01] amen he can speak it forth amen
[42:04] but there's even the spirit of truth
[42:06] whom the world cannot receive
[42:08] because it seeth him not neither knoweth
[42:11] him
[42:12] but ye know him for he dwelleth with you
[42:14] and shall
[42:15] be in you i will not leave you
[42:17] comfortless i will come to you
[42:20] yet a little while in the world seeth me
[42:22] no more but ye
[42:23] see me oh my he's never disappeared from
[42:25] the believer
[42:26] he's never disappeared my brother and
[42:28] sister from the presence of the believer
[42:31] but ye see me because i live ye shall
[42:33] live also
[42:34] at that day you shall know that i am in
[42:36] my father and ye in me
[42:38] and i in you he that hath my
[42:40] commandments and keepeth them
[42:42] he it is that loveth me and he that
[42:44] loveth me shall be loved of my father
[42:47] and i will love him and will manifest
[42:49] myself to him
[42:51] what a beautiful promise we see in the
[42:53] scripture my brother and sister
[42:54] how clearly that god lays this plan out
[42:57] before us
[42:58] it is not something that you need to
[42:59] understand greek
[43:01] that you need to understand aramaic or
[43:03] hebrew or whatever it might be
[43:05] but my brother and sister what we need
[43:07] to do is pray for revelation that we can
[43:09] understand god
[43:10] because he's right here in our midst
[43:12] right in our presence
[43:14] and he says right here that he will
[43:16] manifest himself
[43:18] to us amen when i put the else on there
[43:20] that's because we are
[43:21] to this individual amen look at this and
[43:25] how god has blessed
[43:26] us now i want to come down and just go
[43:27] right into another scripture if you'll
[43:29] just bear with me tonight
[43:31] amen second corinthians the ninth
[43:33] chapter i mean the second chapter verses
[43:35] 9 through 16.
[43:37] amen but as it is written i hath not
[43:41] seen
[43:42] nor ear heard neither hath entered into
[43:44] the heart of man the things which god
[43:46] hath prepared
[43:47] for them that love him so in our
[43:50] previous reading he said if you love me
[43:52] do my commandments now they're telling
[43:55] us here
[43:56] that the scripture is as the apostle
[43:58] paul was speaking to corinthians
[44:00] he's telling us that the very heart of
[44:02] man
[44:03] and the things that god has given our
[44:05] eyes to see our ears to hear what is
[44:08] entered into our heart
[44:09] and and when i say this i hope you
[44:12] follow me
[44:13] god's done some glorious things saints
[44:15] i've seen god just do
[44:17] the supernatural can someone say amen
[44:19] we've seen god do
[44:20] absolutely the supernatural i've seen
[44:23] the sunrise and the sun set
[44:25] i've seen some of the most beautiful
[44:26] places on earth
[44:28] and all of those things it's done
[44:31] i've seen god come on the scene and heal
[44:33] people
[44:34] i've seen god come on the scene and just
[44:37] uh it's just
[44:38] incredible amen i just don't even have
[44:40] time tonight
[44:41] to to stop and so all of that that we
[44:44] have seen all that we have heard
[44:46] and all that has entered into our heart
[44:48] are not
[44:49] even enough to prepare us for what god
[44:52] has come
[44:53] to give to you and i that love him amen
[44:56] look about this you know we sing that
[44:58] song how beautiful heaven must be
[45:00] well my brother and sister if we just
[45:03] get into the spirit
[45:04] stay in the spirit i'm preaching to
[45:05] myself tonight get in the spirit stay in
[45:08] the spirit
[45:08] this old earth we live in right now is
[45:10] just pretty beautiful still
[45:12] amen there's a lot of chaos there's a
[45:14] lot of problems around us
[45:15] but the presence of god is moving in the
[45:18] midst of his believer
[45:20] amen saints sons and daughters of god
[45:23] they're seeing the supernatural they're
[45:25] seeing the sinner
[45:26] still my brother and sister seeing the
[45:28] sinner repent
[45:29] and see lives completely turned around
[45:32] we're seeing as it were
[45:34] the natives and people say well that's a
[45:36] pretty few now
[45:37] but there are still places on the earth
[45:38] my brother and sister where people do
[45:40] not even know the name of jesus christ
[45:42] and when they receive that name there's
[45:45] such miraculous
[45:46] change comes in their world my brother
[45:49] and sister it's just beyond
[45:50] measure to see what god does amen
[45:54] well i'll tell you when we look at this
[45:57] for what man knoweth the things of a man
[45:59] save the spirit of man
[46:01] which is in him even so the things of
[46:03] god knoweth no man but the spirit of god
[46:06] see we can never approach this i
[46:08] preached a little bit on this in the
[46:09] past few weeks
[46:10] my brother and sister we cannot even
[46:12] know or
[46:13] understand or express the things of god
[46:16] without getting into
[46:17] the spirit amen we cannot approach it in
[46:20] a carnal fashion
[46:21] we cannot come it's not about the beauty
[46:24] of our church the beauty of our closed
[46:26] car house whatever it might be none of
[46:28] that will do anything for us
[46:29] but when we get into the spirit of god a
[46:32] whole different world
[46:34] appears amen reminds me of a story once
[46:37] of an individual
[46:38] he was talking about how that he had
[46:40] come on the verge of committing suicide
[46:43] and uh something stopped him and a few
[46:46] days later
[46:47] he was i think riding a subway or a city
[46:50] bus
[46:50] and some man just said i feel like the
[46:53] lord spoke to me
[46:54] and told me to give you this and and he
[46:56] looked down and it was a little pocket
[46:58] bible
[46:59] and the man was like well okay i i don't
[47:02] read the bible and the man says well i
[47:03] know as the lord told me to give it to
[47:05] you
[47:06] a few days later once again that spirit
[47:08] and that's what it is exactly
[47:10] a spirit uh come upon him and he was
[47:12] thinking about taking his life
[47:14] and then he remembered that somewhere in
[47:16] a pocket there that he had that bible
[47:18] amen and when he opened that up my
[47:21] brother and sister one of the most
[47:22] common scriptures that's quoted in the
[47:24] world of christendom
[47:25] he opened it up and it opened directly
[47:27] to john 3 16
[47:29] and god so loved the world and he said
[47:32] something
[47:32] poured over him he said it was so
[47:35] supernatural
[47:36] he said he felt there was a presence as
[47:38] though there was someone right there he
[47:40] could reach out and touch
[47:42] and something struck deep in his heart
[47:44] that god loved him
[47:46] oh my my brother and sister tell me not
[47:49] god's not real
[47:50] man could be sitting there thinking
[47:52] about taking his life and move from that
[47:54] to knowing god loves him in just a
[47:57] moment of time
[47:58] amen hallelujah so
[48:01] now we have received not the spirit of
[48:03] the world but the spirit which is of god
[48:06] that we might know the things that are
[48:07] freely given to us of god
[48:10] so see without receiving this spirit
[48:13] of god we cannot even see the things
[48:16] that god has given to us
[48:18] amen the spirit of the world my brother
[48:20] and sister is the spirit of separation
[48:23] the spirit of the world is what is
[48:25] anointing the people
[48:27] to come to a place that they don't even
[48:30] though they might know that a judgment
[48:32] is coming
[48:33] they might know that there is a hell but
[48:35] they are anointed by this spirit that is
[48:37] the spirit of the world
[48:39] to not even care if they are separated
[48:42] from god
[48:43] so it is not a even a care in their
[48:45] heart
[48:46] not a burden in their heart that they
[48:48] could face the judgment and go
[48:50] to hell see that's been completely
[48:52] erased
[48:53] satan has taken that from them and so
[48:56] when the spirit of the world possesses a
[48:58] person now let's not be mistaken
[49:01] that you might have someone that could
[49:02] even tonight be doing some despicable
[49:05] act
[49:05] and it might be in the day or a week or
[49:07] month or a year
[49:08] god would come to them totally change
[49:10] their life so we need to remember that
[49:12] god's still
[49:13] moving amen in the midst of the people
[49:16] our people
[49:17] us you and i the world amen
[49:21] now
[49:24] which things verse 13 which things also
[49:27] we speak
[49:29] not in words which man's wisdom teaches
[49:32] but which the holy ghost teaches
[49:35] comparing spiritual things with
[49:38] spiritual
[49:39] now i want to ask you before you got
[49:42] saved
[49:43] maybe in the process of being saved god
[49:46] dealing with you
[49:47] is the bible the same book now as it was
[49:51] then
[49:53] i don't believe it can be back then we
[49:56] were looking at our sin
[49:57] what god was going to do for our sin we
[49:59] were looking at being washed we were
[50:01] looking at repenting and being baptized
[50:04] we were desiring the holy ghost which we
[50:06] still do
[50:07] amen but you see the book has taken on
[50:09] much more meaning
[50:11] amen now we're looking into the promises
[50:13] of god we're looking into the
[50:15] revelation the book of revelation is the
[50:17] revelation of jesus christ
[50:19] we're looking into the revelation of
[50:20] jesus christ and he said all that he was
[50:23] he poured into the church which is not a
[50:25] building with a name over the door but
[50:27] it's you and i
[50:27] and so we cannot look at the book the
[50:30] same that we have
[50:31] and as time goes on my brother and
[50:33] sister uh you know i'll just type this
[50:35] not to embarrass my wife
[50:37] but every once in a while probably not
[50:39] as often as we should
[50:40] sister jerry will pull this box out that
[50:42] has all the letters that i i wrote
[50:45] uh uh to her in our courtship amen this
[50:48] is long before you know internet
[50:50] and and we had just a few moments uh
[50:53] of time you know to talk on the
[50:55] telephone i don't know
[50:57] it was sunday afternoons at what time
[50:58] was it
[51:00] three o'clock that was our little time
[51:02] we had a little short time on the
[51:03] telephone
[51:04] but looking back through this my brother
[51:06] and sister i hope you catch this i'm
[51:07] trying to embarrass my wife or
[51:09] be too public but you know when you open
[51:11] that up and you just select a little
[51:12] letter or card out of there
[51:14] and i read that card sometimes we laugh
[51:17] and go oh my were we silly
[51:19] but you know what it does it turns
[51:21] something inside of me
[51:23] amen because you see the desire the love
[51:26] i have for her
[51:27] has not waned it has got greater and i
[51:30] hope you understand what i'm talking
[51:31] about your bible not being the same
[51:33] as i look these letters and i tell her
[51:36] you're beautiful and i
[51:37] i longed to see you i wished i was there
[51:40] today but a letter will have to do
[51:42] and what did you do and what did all
[51:44] this stuff my brother and sister i look
[51:46] back and i think lord how blessed i am
[51:48] amen you know it is wonderful to check
[51:50] that out it's good
[51:52] you know even when you're fighting it
[51:54] might be good to look through your old
[51:55] love letters
[51:57] amen you know even in hard times maybe
[51:59] you ought to look through your love
[52:00] letters
[52:01] amen i'll tell you what we have right
[52:03] here we have a love letter
[52:04] that's right here this is what this is
[52:06] my brother and sister some people get
[52:08] all confused thinking the bible
[52:10] is about the heathen and the agnostic
[52:12] and the atheist out here
[52:13] but the bible really truly if you
[52:15] encapsulate it
[52:16] is a love letter to the bride of jesus
[52:19] christ
[52:20] oh my take your love letters with you
[52:22] amen
[52:24] oh hallelujah well look at this see
[52:27] things we all which things also we speak
[52:30] not in words which man's wisdom teaches
[52:33] but which the holy ghost teaches
[52:35] comparing spiritual things with
[52:37] spiritual amen not an intellectual
[52:39] gospel saints right
[52:41] but the natural man receiveth not the
[52:43] things of the spirit of god
[52:44] for they are foolishness unto him
[52:46] neither can he know them because they
[52:48] are
[52:49] spiritually discerned here's revelation
[52:52] coming right out of the word
[52:53] telling us right here that they cannot
[52:56] understand this because it has to be
[52:58] spiritually discerned
[52:59] does the word of god say that we
[53:02] wouldn't cannot even call
[53:03] jesus the christ without the holy ghost
[53:06] amen
[53:06] so people can mimic or voice that let me
[53:09] use the word i hope it's not offensive
[53:11] they can parrot it anyone can come and
[53:14] parrot the gospel
[53:15] i love the lord i'm thankful for this
[53:18] i'm thankful for that
[53:19] and god bless all this and those words
[53:21] can just be parroted my brother and
[53:23] sister
[53:23] but when you get back down into the
[53:26] spiritual side
[53:27] and a man says you know what jesus
[53:29] christ is lord
[53:30] it has an entirely different
[53:33] significance
[53:34] than the man who does not have the holy
[53:36] ghost but has a religious spirit
[53:38] might have raised up in church always
[53:40] faithful in church might pay tithes and
[53:42] support building programs and
[53:43] be on committees but if he doesn't have
[53:46] the holy ghost
[53:47] those words do not contain the same
[53:50] authority
[53:51] amen just like some other man a stranger
[53:54] pardon me for bringing it personal
[53:56] but a stranger could walk up to my wife
[53:59] and we might be somewhere in my
[54:01] walk up to her and say i love you
[54:05] it will not bring about the same
[54:08] response are you with me tonight
[54:12] amen you see what happens is there's an
[54:15] intimacy
[54:15] that only comes from getting in the
[54:18] inner veil
[54:19] into the very presence of almighty god
[54:22] amen
[54:24] but he that is spiritual judgeth all
[54:26] things yet he himself is judged of no
[54:28] man
[54:28] now we hear this quoted a lot and i just
[54:31] spoke on it here a while back a few
[54:32] words but
[54:33] i want to just remind you my brother and
[54:35] sister that he is spiritual justice all
[54:38] things yet he himself is not judged of
[54:39] no man
[54:40] that's because he has already allowed
[54:43] himself to be judged by the word of god
[54:46] amen so it's not going to matter whether
[54:48] some man says he's right or he's wrong
[54:50] that he's a fanatic that he's a jesus
[54:52] freak or whatever they might say
[54:54] my brother and sister a holy roller
[54:56] whatever it won't matter see when that
[54:58] man has been judged by the word of god
[55:00] he's already judged and the words of no
[55:03] man will
[55:04] change the judgment of god amen that
[55:06] doesn't mean that you can't judge me i'm
[55:08] out here robbing banks
[55:10] getting drunk oh don't judge me no
[55:12] that's not what it's talking about but
[55:14] people twisted into that realm
[55:16] because they just don't want to face the
[55:17] judgment but my brother and sister it's
[55:19] when a man's already been judged by the
[55:21] word
[55:21] that the world won't judge that man amen
[55:24] so you look upon standing upon that
[55:26] to know that we have been given such a
[55:28] beautiful opportunity
[55:30] to be judged by the word of god and to
[55:32] respond
[55:33] as i've been speaking to you my brother
[55:35] and sister it's one thing to read your
[55:36] bible
[55:37] it's another thing to pray but if you do
[55:39] not submit yourself to the word of god
[55:41] none of that will do you any good amen
[55:44] for who hath known the mind of the lord
[55:47] that he may instruct him but we have the
[55:50] mind
[55:51] of christ now you know if you go around
[55:53] and you spout that off
[55:55] people are going to say that you are uh
[55:57] well i don't know we live in such an age
[55:59] where everybody's offended i don't know
[56:00] what they'll call you
[56:01] spiritually racist i don't know
[56:05] what they would call you people don't
[56:06] like it people don't like the idea that
[56:09] christians can stand up with confidence
[56:11] and declare to the world that they've
[56:13] got the holy ghost
[56:14] that they have the mind of christ they
[56:16] don't like that you're too confident
[56:18] you're supposed to as a christian just
[56:20] kind of stumble around and stumble along
[56:22] and make all kinds of mistakes and then
[56:24] tell everybody i tell you this just gets
[56:26] my goat up amen i hope you don't mind
[56:28] but it just really rips me up when
[56:30] people are like well god knows i'm
[56:32] broken
[56:33] well good i have a repair manual that's
[56:36] got all kinds of repair
[56:37] instructions it's got all kinds of
[56:40] instructions to break everything that
[56:42] you could possibly as a human break
[56:44] amen i don't think god's gonna buy the
[56:46] excuse
[56:47] well god knows i'm broken well good let
[56:50] god
[56:50] fix you that you can stand up and say
[56:52] you know what i've got
[56:54] the mind of god amen i've got his spirit
[56:57] i'm gonna do greater works amen i don't
[57:00] have to sit down and be some just lily
[57:02] pad
[57:03] christian just hoping that it'll be a
[57:04] good day the sun will shine and
[57:06] everything will be all right
[57:07] i can have some confidence the word says
[57:10] i can bind
[57:11] amen this word says i can loose the word
[57:14] says that i can offer
[57:16] the grace of god to those around me my
[57:18] brother and sister i don't have to
[57:20] become a wallflower christian
[57:22] i can stand up with a little confidence
[57:24] and say you know what
[57:25] god answers prayer and i will pray for
[57:27] you if you desire
[57:29] i will pray for you and i believe god
[57:30] will come on this scene
[57:32] i remember once uh years ago my brother
[57:35] and sister
[57:35] now i spoke and i'm not speaking of me
[57:37] but just to give a reference
[57:39] i remember i actually went to uh to uh
[57:42] some neighbors a few miles from us
[57:44] actually but
[57:45] can still consider them neighbors and i
[57:47] was looking for the husband
[57:49] and uh but he wasn't home and they have
[57:51] a couple handicapped children one of
[57:53] them has passed
[57:54] away now and uh so we're standing out in
[57:56] the yard
[57:57] and uh these people used to be holiness
[58:00] and i was talking to her
[58:02] and um just it just come out of me she
[58:05] said well
[58:06] i see i see your wife in the store i i
[58:09] see your wife sometimes in town and
[58:11] i i see she still wears a dress all the
[58:14] time and i said yes cause we
[58:16] it's not something that was church it's
[58:18] something that's down in her heart
[58:20] she don't do it because i wanted her to
[58:22] do it she does it because there's a
[58:24] conviction in her heart
[58:25] and that's how she feels to be and you
[58:28] know we got to talking
[58:29] and and she said well you know i used to
[58:32] just be on fire for the lord
[58:34] and i just really loved him but you know
[58:36] life is hard
[58:38] and i don't know it just come out of me
[58:39] and i told her i said look
[58:41] if you will turn now saints i was
[58:44] shocked by the very words come out of my
[58:45] mouth but i spoke to her just with
[58:47] confidence a almost booming voice if you
[58:50] will turn back to god
[58:51] god will heal both of your children
[58:55] now for myself after hearing my own
[58:57] voice i was like oh my
[58:59] what have i just said but i tell you
[59:01] what hurt me
[59:03] what cut me right to the depth of my
[59:04] heart she had tears in her eyes she
[59:06] looked me in the face
[59:07] and said i can't do that oh god it broke
[59:11] my heart saints
[59:13] you see there comes something a divide
[59:15] in there
[59:16] so conquered by the spirit of the world
[59:18] if you're with me
[59:19] amen so conquered she wasn't able to
[59:22] even
[59:22] take the basic promises of god and apply
[59:25] him back to her life
[59:30] and she said my church has failed man i
[59:32] said it never should have been your
[59:33] church
[59:34] it should have been a relationship with
[59:36] god we run into them just here
[59:39] uh uh two or three weeks ago restaurant
[59:42] here in town
[59:44] and you know i've always there's always
[59:46] been a little strain there but they were
[59:47] just they were just
[59:48] open and speaking to me and as they
[59:50] walked off i actually was a little
[59:52] surprised they said well god bless you
[59:53] paul you and your wife
[59:55] now my brother and sister we don't want
[59:57] to put a period on the end of what is
[59:58] happening amen
[1:00:00] but we got to fully realize we need to
[1:00:03] fully realize the position
[1:00:05] fully realize the value what god has
[1:00:08] given to us
[1:00:09] this position god has given us should
[1:00:10] not ever be considered a burden
[1:00:12] whether we are old we should never say
[1:00:15] well being a christian is so hard
[1:00:17] we should just talk my brother and
[1:00:19] sister of the power of the word we
[1:00:20] should open our mouth
[1:00:21] and we ought to declare that i am so
[1:00:24] thankful i consider it a privilege
[1:00:26] god would call my name and that he would
[1:00:29] come and save me
[1:00:30] and give me an opportunity to serve him
[1:00:32] we shouldn't ever come to the place that
[1:00:34] we say well
[1:00:35] i i don't know i this is so much it's so
[1:00:38] uh you know intensive i i have to give
[1:00:41] up or i have to do
[1:00:43] my brother and sister oh lord help us to
[1:00:45] realize the value
[1:00:47] that has been given to us amen remember
[1:00:50] the story about the violin
[1:00:52] and the auctioneer just a few dollars
[1:00:54] but when a master stood up and started
[1:00:55] to play the violin
[1:00:57] they realized this violin might have
[1:00:59] been a little battered it might have a
[1:01:01] scratch and be a little faded
[1:01:02] maybe the finish is checked just a
[1:01:04] little bit but the heart of that violin
[1:01:07] come out in the hand of a master oh it
[1:01:09] don't come out with someone
[1:01:11] that just half-heartedly plays it
[1:01:12] someone they're just gonna bang around
[1:01:14] on it but a master my brother and sister
[1:01:16] will bring it out
[1:01:17] and the master has come and offered you
[1:01:19] and i this position
[1:01:21] isn't this beautiful i'll tell you you
[1:01:23] talk about value
[1:01:25] oh it's a greater value than anything
[1:01:27] that man could ever be given
[1:01:29] now look this isn't to give us some kind
[1:01:31] of self-importance
[1:01:33] not for us to be a permissive people now
[1:01:36] permissive is a word with several
[1:01:38] you might say uh uh definitions
[1:01:41] but the one coming out in this context
[1:01:44] is not to be a liberal
[1:01:45] people i'm saved i can do anything
[1:01:49] you know sometimes that creeps into our
[1:01:51] house sometimes
[1:01:52] we let it in ourself the devil don't
[1:01:54] even have to slip it in the door
[1:01:56] we drag it in amen but look at this my
[1:02:00] brother and sister
[1:02:01] god called you and i the people who can
[1:02:04] recognize the eternal
[1:02:06] worth of the gospel to us this is not
[1:02:08] just about
[1:02:09] us sacrificing to ourselves i've been
[1:02:10] preaching to you about dying to
[1:02:13] ourselves
[1:02:13] and giving christ preeminence this is
[1:02:16] not about just dying
[1:02:17] my brother and sister the monks not the
[1:02:20] monks
[1:02:20] the monks the monks
[1:02:24] look there's people on the face of the
[1:02:26] earth that daily physically
[1:02:29] punish themselves you might say to to
[1:02:31] try to gain
[1:02:32] god's favor show me in the word of god
[1:02:40] it's not there
[1:02:43] but to die to ourself is not to
[1:02:46] so much torture ourself
[1:02:49] i i put this in a nutshell it's not so
[1:02:51] much to to
[1:02:52] to force ourselves what dying to ourself
[1:02:56] could be put in a nutshell is
[1:02:58] we just simply quit listening to the
[1:03:00] devil
[1:03:02] you'll die to it because you see the
[1:03:04] devil doesn't deal
[1:03:05] with the soul the devil deals with the
[1:03:08] mind
[1:03:08] and with the flesh so we can die to
[1:03:11] ourselves right the scripture tells us
[1:03:13] to put away our vain imaginations
[1:03:15] boy i'll tell you what every time i
[1:03:17] think it's pretty funny i think about
[1:03:19] this
[1:03:19] we drive down the boulevard over here
[1:03:21] and we get to the main intersection down
[1:03:23] there where
[1:03:23] where you know the car wash is here and
[1:03:25] the glasses place and
[1:03:27] and uh the texas roadhouse on the other
[1:03:30] side
[1:03:31] and just beyond the texas roadhouse
[1:03:33] about 40 feet in the air is the mega
[1:03:35] lotto sign
[1:03:38] come on don't tell me you guys have
[1:03:39] never thought about it
[1:03:41] what would i do with 500 million dollars
[1:03:44] probably backslide
[1:03:48] amen see that just be one more added
[1:03:51] thing on your plate that you'd have to
[1:03:53] deal with
[1:03:54] the devil had come and tell you how
[1:03:55] smart you was and how good looking you
[1:03:57] was
[1:03:58] and how you deserved and maybe god needs
[1:04:00] to keep us poor
[1:04:02] amen maybe we need to be a praying lord
[1:04:05] you know
[1:04:05] we need some help to get through
[1:04:06] tomorrow amen
[1:04:09] you see my brother and sister we come to
[1:04:10] this place when we recognize the
[1:04:13] eternal worth of the gospel to us
[1:04:16] when we start to realize what it is that
[1:04:19] not everyone on the face of the earth
[1:04:21] will have the opportunity and feel
[1:04:24] compelled to respond
[1:04:26] to the word of god now i just i don't
[1:04:29] mean to be rude to you but i want to
[1:04:30] just put you in a spot here
[1:04:32] to acknowledge yea or nay do you believe
[1:04:34] god called you or not
[1:04:36] amen amen if you don't believe god
[1:04:38] called you then what are we doing here
[1:04:41] amen but if you believe god called you
[1:04:43] then
[1:04:44] recognize the value that come from god
[1:04:48] calling you amen it's not trivial it's
[1:04:50] not insignificant
[1:04:52] it is incredible my brother and sister
[1:04:54] and if you don't think so you just hold
[1:04:56] that breath
[1:04:57] until we get into the white throne
[1:04:59] judgment and the world comes up in
[1:05:00] judgment and how they will cry for mercy
[1:05:06] and you will praise god that he called
[1:05:08] you and washed
[1:05:09] filled you with the spirit amen there
[1:05:12] won't be nobody there saying well you
[1:05:14] know it was tough
[1:05:15] no there'll be a lot of rejoicings thank
[1:05:17] you lord thank you lord thank you lord
[1:05:20] well maybe we ought to get to the place
[1:05:22] we thank him a little bit right here
[1:05:23] right now
[1:05:24] thank you lord because this eternal
[1:05:26] value that you have deposited in
[1:05:29] us lord is not just a a labor a burden
[1:05:33] it's not an inconvenience amen it's
[1:05:35] worth
[1:05:36] more than all amen you know one time
[1:05:38] saints i had a pretty big calculator at
[1:05:41] that time i don't remember how many
[1:05:42] decimal places it was

[1:07:34] who plays
[1:07:35] a certain part oh my brother and sister
[1:07:38] if we could recognize in this great
[1:07:40] drama that we call life
[1:07:41] that god has come down and said you know

[1:08:49] when we'll look and recognize the power
[1:08:53] and the holiness of the world now this
[1:08:55] will be a little harsh a little critical
[1:08:57] sounding please forgive me
[1:08:59] but my brother and sister when you have
[1:09:00] people who smoke drink
[1:09:02] dance cheat lie whatever it is and say
[1:09:06] they're a christian
[1:09:07] they're denying the power and the
[1:09:09] holiness of our lord jesus christ
[1:09:12] amen there's nothing supports that
[1:09:14] there's nothing
[1:09:15] but it is oh let us take this right back
[1:09:18] and wind it back up
[1:09:20] it is weak pulpits don't want to offend
[1:09:23] anybody
[1:09:24] we don't want to make anybody
[1:09:25] uncomfortable well my brother and sister
[1:09:27] i imagine the white throne judgment
[1:09:29] when a man who's lived his life any old
[1:09:31] willy-nilly way
[1:09:32] gets called he's going to be really
[1:09:34] uncomfortable he's going to be wishing
[1:09:35] you had made him uncomfortable here
[1:09:37] so he wouldn't have to be uncomfortable
[1:09:39] there amen
[1:09:40] so what happens the anointed word now
[1:09:43] look saints
[1:09:44] not every sermon i've ever preached to
[1:09:45] you is anointed you know that
[1:09:48] well you know how i know you know it
[1:09:50] because some of you slept right through
[1:09:52] it
[1:09:57] hallelujah i love you all
[1:10:02] now look my brother and sister the truth
[1:10:03] of it is not every sermon
[1:10:05] does the minister break through into
[1:10:07] that anointing
[1:10:08] and be able to express maybe even just a
[1:10:11] few hours before
[1:10:12] the the uh the anointing that was on him
[1:10:15] but maybe something
[1:10:16] happens and and that just seems to be
[1:10:19] bound up and he never really gets into
[1:10:21] that
[1:10:23] but i want you to take this and chew on
[1:10:26] it
[1:10:28] every time you hear the word of god
[1:10:33] even if the preacher is not anointed
[1:10:36] this word is anointed
[1:10:40] i don't care if the preacher can put you
[1:10:43] to sleep
[1:10:48] you've heard those kind before right
[1:10:52] i don't care if he puts you asleep you
[1:10:54] got to come to the place you recognize
[1:10:56] this word is anointed
[1:10:59] right in the middle of one of them
[1:11:03] someone crying out to god i just read
[1:11:06] you the scripture
[1:11:07] ask anything in my name
[1:11:11] and i will do it
[1:11:14] well the preacher wasn't anointed so i
[1:11:15] just didn't get anything out of church
[1:11:17] really you need an anointed preacher
[1:11:20] maybe what you need is an actor or you
[1:11:22] need something to draw your
[1:11:23] no come on the value is not in the man
[1:11:28] holding the book the value is in the
[1:11:30] book
[1:11:31] this anointed word will bring a
[1:11:33] supernatural effect
[1:11:34] every single time that you approach it
[1:11:37] as an anointed book
[1:11:39] amen you appoint approach it is just ink
[1:11:41] on paper
[1:11:42] then it is ink on paper to you but when
[1:11:44] you approach it as a supernatural word
[1:11:47] amen it will bring about a supernatural
[1:11:50] effect
[1:11:51] amen oh i'll tell you what it'll do
[1:11:53] it'll either move us deeper into the
[1:11:54] word it'll
[1:11:55] meet me with move us deeper into our own
[1:11:57] ideas
[1:11:58] amen that's what it'll do we'll look at
[1:12:00] that now i want you to look at the power
[1:12:02] here for a moment i didn't get much
[1:12:03] response out of you guys on that
[1:12:05] hey man hopefully it was just a mouthful
[1:12:07] and you're chewing on it
[1:12:10] come on this is not going to be what
[1:12:13] brother paul can preach or how well
[1:12:15] brother paul can preach
[1:12:16] then it would become a talent show
[1:12:20] but when you approach i approach the
[1:12:22] word of god
[1:12:23] as a supernatural word that we have been
[1:12:26] privileged to have opened and dispensed
[1:12:29] to us
[1:12:30] then the power of the word will be
[1:12:32] unleashed in you and i
[1:12:34] hallelujah we get so pampered my brother
[1:12:36] and sister
[1:12:37] on this good preacher and that good
[1:12:38] preacher and i won't come to church if
[1:12:40] this preacher's preaching
[1:12:42] because you know he just preaches too
[1:12:43] long or too boring or to this or to that
[1:12:46] my brother and sister and they wonder
[1:12:48] why they're not getting anything out of
[1:12:49] church
[1:12:50] because they have made this book a dead
[1:12:53] letter
[1:12:54] not the preacher not the church not
[1:12:56] anyone else they themselves have made
[1:12:58] this a dead letter
[1:13:00] i refuse to allow this to become a dead
[1:13:02] letter this book is living it's
[1:13:04] supernatural
[1:13:05] stirs my heart every time i read it
[1:13:07] either to to
[1:13:08] absolute joy or to repentance
[1:13:11] hallelujah i don't you know i've come to
[1:13:13] a place i don't even care if god's
[1:13:14] correcting me
[1:13:16] i'm not even like oh oh it's correct to
[1:13:17] me again it's actually thank you lord
[1:13:20] thank you lord you're correcting me
[1:13:21] again amen you're not going to let the
[1:13:23] air
[1:13:24] remain in me because i am a supernatural
[1:13:28] being
[1:13:28] and the supernatural word was sent to
[1:13:30] stir
[1:13:31] the life inside this supernatural being
[1:13:34] i want to ask you again tonight if you
[1:13:36] participate
[1:13:37] is there any supernatural beings here
[1:13:39] tonight amen
[1:13:40] or anyone that the power of god has so
[1:13:42] radically changed your life
[1:13:44] you're not ashamed of that change
[1:13:46] hallelujah
[1:13:47] amen oh hallelujah now let's look at the
[1:13:51] power here for a minute
[1:13:53] now it might not seem as though i have
[1:13:56] really preached to my title but in just
[1:13:58] a few minutes lord willing
[1:14:00] i i will get there let's turn to the
[1:14:02] book of isaiah
[1:14:05] now actually
[1:14:08] i didn't want you to read all of that
[1:14:09] first i wanted to talk to you but
[1:14:11] i've done it it's all right you see my
[1:14:14] brother and sister many times
[1:14:16] we get so comfortable in our skin you
[1:14:19] might say
[1:14:20] we get so comfortable in our world
[1:14:24] you oftentimes ask people well
[1:14:27] uh you know how long you been a
[1:14:29] christian
[1:14:31] i'll have you to know
[1:14:34] i've been a christian for 40 years
[1:14:37] or worse they'll say well i've attended
[1:14:40] such and such church for 40 years
[1:14:44] but my brother and sister it's really
[1:14:46] not about
[1:14:48] the time
[1:14:54] 40 years of mediocrity
[1:14:57] is just mediocrity
[1:15:04] would that be correct
[1:15:08] i think we should change the matrix by
[1:15:10] which we measure christianity
[1:15:13] how many years have you been on fire
[1:15:17] for god
[1:15:20] how many wildfires have you left behind
[1:15:23] you
[1:15:28] i'm guilty
[1:15:32] but you know what that come from we
[1:15:35] haven't been putting enough value
[1:15:37] on the word of god we read our bible as
[1:15:41] though it was a book
[1:15:41] you know my you know my opinion i'll
[1:15:43] voice it again i guess because i'm here
[1:15:45] and nobody's going to stop me from
[1:15:46] voicing it
[1:15:48] let's just start throwing stuff at me
[1:15:52] my brother and sister i'm not one of
[1:15:54] these that is all excited about people
[1:15:56] who are like
[1:15:57] yup i read five chapters of the bible in
[1:15:59] 10 weeks
[1:16:01] what did you get out of it
[1:16:05] see we got to stop and
[1:16:08] ponder that it's not about the quantity
[1:16:11] but what are we getting from it
[1:16:16] and if you read it and you are not oh
[1:16:19] i've said this before
[1:16:20] but i have to say it again if you are
[1:16:22] reading it and it is
[1:16:23] not inspiring you you need to stop and
[1:16:26] read it again
[1:16:28] well i didn't really get a whole lot out
[1:16:30] of jehu doing what he did
[1:16:32] well it ought to be a lesson in there in
[1:16:34] fact there's a great lesson in jehu
[1:16:37] amen it don't matter they build in the
[1:16:40] walls they
[1:16:40] they were rebuilding the city rebuilding
[1:16:42] the temple they were doing this they
[1:16:44] were doing that
[1:16:45] my brother and sister it just doesn't
[1:16:47] seem exciting i'll tell you just an
[1:16:49] example
[1:16:49] can i can i just share one example real
[1:16:51] quick i have read
[1:16:54] about gideon so many times in my life
[1:16:58] so many times in my life i've read the
[1:17:00] story of gideon and there they are on
[1:17:02] the side of the mountain they're hiding
[1:17:04] from the midianites trying to hide food
[1:17:06] they're living in rags because the
[1:17:07] midianites come and take everything like
[1:17:09] locust
[1:17:11] and then one day i'm sitting there
[1:17:12] reading it i literally said lord there's
[1:17:14] something here i
[1:17:16] am missing
[1:17:19] and i'm reading it again
[1:17:23] and i i don't know how i miss this
[1:17:26] the fire come up out of
[1:17:30] the rock and consumed
[1:17:35] and it struck me like a load of bricks
[1:17:38] jesus christ the representation of the
[1:17:41] word the rock
[1:17:42] was right there in his midst all the
[1:17:45] time
[1:17:47] god was with him all the time
[1:17:51] and it was an inconvenience it was
[1:17:53] something to hide behind it was
[1:17:56] something
[1:17:58] i remember it just struck me and right
[1:18:00] behind that another scripture come and i
[1:18:01] went and turned in my bible
[1:18:03] and i was like there it is there it is
[1:18:06] this has been many years ago i was like
[1:18:08] here he is he's the rock in the
[1:18:10] wilderness he was the rock here he was
[1:18:12] the rock there he was a rock
[1:18:14] rocks from the middle of the jordan that
[1:18:17] made the altar for sacrifice
[1:18:19] all of it just tied together so and all
[1:18:21] of a sudden you get excited it's like

[1:18:32] fleece before the lord you set something
[1:18:34] down
[1:18:35] on the rock and fire comes out of the
[1:18:36] rock and just consumes it i mean
[1:18:38] i happens four or five times a week
[1:18:43] but you know what happens the
[1:18:45] supernatural in our midst is so
[1:18:48] common to us

[1:18:55] supernatural is so common
[1:18:56] we've got to we're up god healed
[1:18:58] somebody ah no big deal

[1:19:12] that you know i just saw one here the
[1:19:14] other day

[1:19:16] the last 40 years it was going to kill
[1:19:18] all of us
[1:19:20] do you guys realize now i'll forget the
[1:19:21] dates but you guys realize it's a
[1:19:23] like in the 70s we were going into the
[1:19:25] ice age
[1:19:27] amen we were going to all be like the
[1:19:28] wooly mammoth they're going to find us
[1:19:31] frozen a rock
[1:19:35] peanut butter and jelly sandwich in one
[1:19:37] hand and they're going to be going what
[1:19:38] is that
[1:19:40] yeah come on
[1:19:45] we ain't got nothing to be afraid of the
[1:19:48] scripture says that we are sealed until
[1:19:50] the day of our redemption
[1:19:51] and if i keeled over with a heart attack
[1:19:53] right now saints
[1:19:54] you guys would all be going oh my
[1:19:56] goodness brother paul just died right in
[1:19:57] front of us
[1:19:58] but i sealed to the day of my redemption
[1:20:00] hey man it don't matter how god chooses
[1:20:02] to take us
[1:20:04] ain't got nothing to be afraid of amen
[1:20:06] hallelujah
[1:20:08] look i'll tell you about this years ago
[1:20:10] i had a friend live in san diego
[1:20:13] and his mother-in-law and sister-in-law
[1:20:16] and a cousin were sitting in a house
[1:20:19] when an airliner
[1:20:20] fell out of the sky and there was no
[1:20:23] more house
[1:20:24] my brother and sister what are you going
[1:20:26] to hide from
[1:20:28] where are you going to hide nowhere
[1:20:31] i'm gonna hide in christ hallelujah i'm
[1:20:33] gonna hide in the word
[1:20:35] oh now let me get going here this plate
[1:20:37] this little plate i had is so big
[1:20:40] in the year that king uzziah died i saw
[1:20:42] also the lord sitting upon a throne high
[1:20:44] and lifted up
[1:20:45] and his train filled the temple and
[1:20:47] above it stood the seraphims and each
[1:20:49] one had six wings
[1:20:50] with twain he covered his face with
[1:20:52] twain he covered his feet
[1:20:54] with twain he did fly and one cried unto
[1:20:57] another and said holy holy holy is the
[1:21:00] lord of hosts
[1:21:01] the whole earth is full of his glory
[1:21:05] well that's of course wasn't where we
[1:21:08] lived because
[1:21:09] god just ain't doing nothing in our
[1:21:10] neighborhood
[1:21:12] hmm and the post of the door moved at
[1:21:15] the voice of him that cried and the
[1:21:17] house was filled with smoke
[1:21:19] then said now this is the prophet isaiah
[1:21:21] my brother and sister and i want you to
[1:21:22] understand
[1:21:23] we get comfortable in our skin and here
[1:21:25] is the prophet isaiah
[1:21:26] amen as a prophet priest he has become
[1:21:29] used to doing the things of god as god
[1:21:33] would command him he was faithful
[1:21:35] you'll find nowhere that isaiah was a
[1:21:37] blatant sinner
[1:21:39] stepping off of the word outside of the
[1:21:40] boundaries of the word
[1:21:42] but it becomes such commonplace to him
[1:21:44] influenced by those around him
[1:21:46] and here he is as a man of god still
[1:21:49] doing the word of god the word doesn't
[1:21:51] call him backslid doesn't call him a
[1:21:52] devil doesn't say he's got a devil on
[1:21:54] him
[1:21:54] but here he is now in this vision and he
[1:21:57] is seeing this come to pass
[1:21:59] and in this he's there and he says whoa
[1:22:03] is me for i am undone
[1:22:06] because i am a man of unclean lips
[1:22:10] and dwell in the midst of a people of
[1:22:13] unclean lips
[1:22:14] for mine eyes have seen the king the
[1:22:16] lord of hosts
[1:22:18] oh my brother and sister oh i tonight i
[1:22:20] just
[1:22:21] i guess if i could express it maybe i'm
[1:22:23] not getting the right words out to you
[1:22:24] but my brother and sister how it is that
[1:22:26] we as believers as
[1:22:28] as christians and we have the word of
[1:22:30] god we've got the life of god
[1:22:32] i believe every one of us could stop and
[1:22:33] say god's done something supernatural
[1:22:35] that i can speak of healing me
[1:22:37] delivering me
[1:22:38] providing for me and we come so
[1:22:41] commonplace to this
[1:22:42] are we living worldly lives no we're not
[1:22:44] are we doing uh
[1:22:45] evil things or we're not liars we're not
[1:22:48] thieves we're not doing this but we've
[1:22:49] fallen
[1:22:50] into a pattern where we would take the
[1:22:52] word of a man over the word of god
[1:22:54] the word of a a doubter or a negative
[1:22:56] person would influence us whether to
[1:22:58] come up and claim healing or just simply
[1:23:00] stand in our sea
[1:23:01] and say lord it's your word that by your
[1:23:03] stripes i am healed period i claim it
[1:23:06] but we'll let the naysayer well you know
[1:23:08] when you get this and the doctor has a
[1:23:10] better medicine
[1:23:11] and this is going to do my brother and
[1:23:12] sister i say we have seen the lord of
[1:23:15] hosts we have seen him his train has
[1:23:17] filled the temple
[1:23:18] and the earth is full of his glory and
[1:23:20] we'll sit right here
[1:23:22] and come to a place that we are immobile
[1:23:25] we are paralyzed to it but i would ask
[1:23:27] tonight
[1:23:28] if god by his grace we could be like the
[1:23:30] prophet isaiah and recognize god is here
[1:23:33] and look at that and say whoa unto me
[1:23:36] woe is me
[1:23:37] amen i have seen god and what did he do
[1:23:41] the isaiah
[1:23:42] prophet isaiah he comes to a place that
[1:23:45] he
[1:23:46] repents here oh forgive me i'm so
[1:23:48] excited i can't really contain myself
[1:23:50] amen he's repenting he's declaring woe
[1:23:54] is me
[1:23:54] i'm undone amen i'm a man of unclean
[1:23:57] lips i repent lord
[1:23:59] and i dwell with people oh my goodness i
[1:24:01] just called you guys unclean
[1:24:06] well hallelujah in the right context i
[1:24:07] hope you can lift a hand and say oh lord
[1:24:10] amen lord that's us lord
[1:24:14] then flew one of the seraphims unto me
[1:24:16] having a live coal in his hand
[1:24:18] which he'd taken with tongs from off the
[1:24:20] altar and he laid it upon my mouth and
[1:24:22] said lo
[1:24:24] this hath touched thy lips and thine
[1:24:26] iniquity
[1:24:27] is taken away and thy sin is purged what
[1:24:30] was this
[1:24:31] the fire amen right from the altar of
[1:24:34] almighty god
[1:24:35] my brother and sister we don't have to
[1:24:37] have an angel with a a
[1:24:39] a coal off the altar tonight we got the
[1:24:41] holy ghost
[1:24:42] and would it come in our midst oh you
[1:24:44] say out brother paul do you think we're
[1:24:46] all backslid
[1:24:46] no i'm not i just think we can be purged
[1:24:49] by the power
[1:24:50] and the fire of the altar of god a
[1:24:52] closer consecrated walk than we've ever
[1:24:54] walked before
[1:24:56] am i asking too much
[1:25:00] because you see it goes further than
[1:25:02] this amen
[1:25:04] touched his lips and i heard the voice
[1:25:06] of god saying
[1:25:07] whom shall i sin and who will go for us
[1:25:11] and something stirred in the heart of
[1:25:14] isaiah
[1:25:16] then said i here am i send me
[1:25:19] amen
[1:25:24] amen oh saints look at this
[1:25:29] go and tell this people hear ye indeed
[1:25:32] but understand not see you indeed but
[1:25:35] perceive
[1:25:36] not make the heart of this people fat
[1:25:40] and make their ears heavy and shut their
[1:25:42] eyes
[1:25:43] lest they see with their eyes and hear
[1:25:45] with their ears and understand with
[1:25:47] their heart
[1:25:47] and convert and be healed
[1:25:55] see how thankful you ought to be
[1:25:58] some's eyes were made not to see some
[1:26:00] ears were made not to hear some hearts
[1:26:02] were made so heavy they can't receive it
[1:26:05] but not you amen you realize the value
[1:26:08] of what god has placed in you
[1:26:11] that we could be in that position but
[1:26:13] god chose for you to be
[1:26:15] in this position
[1:26:19] there's many my brother and sister they
[1:26:22] don't even really care whether there's a
[1:26:24] god or not that's right
[1:26:26] i was reading a book it was a history
[1:26:28] sister sue got me about world war
[1:26:30] ii and this man is recounting
[1:26:34] a certain situation and even in the book
[1:26:37] i
[1:26:37] i actually set the book down and i can't
[1:26:39] decide whether to finish reading it or
[1:26:41] not there's so much cursing in the book
[1:26:44] but the man's describing how he jumped
[1:26:46] out of an airplane on
[1:26:48] at normandy and how his buddies are
[1:26:50] getting shot up
[1:26:51] by the the germans shooting them up as
[1:26:54] they're floating down in the parachute
[1:26:55] and many of them falling so heavy laden
[1:26:58] it takes a few minutes to unstrap the
[1:26:59] straps so they could even get up and the
[1:27:01] germans just coming by shooting them on
[1:27:03] the ground
[1:27:04] and he said here i am he said you know
[1:27:06] and he's using all kinds of curse words
[1:27:08] going along this and the lord's name in
[1:27:10] vain and all this
[1:27:11] and he said there i was praying dear god
[1:27:13] let me live
[1:27:16] you see there's a misunderstanding my
[1:27:18] brother and sister that we can
[1:27:20] use the lord's name in vain and have no
[1:27:22] reverence to him
[1:27:24] and then want him to come on the scene
[1:27:25] and save my life
[1:27:27] now the man no doubt feels like that his
[1:27:29] life was saved and god answered his
[1:27:31] prayer because
[1:27:32] he lived through the whole war through
[1:27:35] very
[1:27:35] bloody very bloody things
[1:27:39] but you see my brother and sister we
[1:27:41] have to place a value
[1:27:43] on presence of jesus christ in our life
[1:27:50] you know i've got some other things to
[1:27:51] read but this is going to carry on
[1:27:54] tonight
[1:27:57] far too long
[1:28:02] ah live
[1:28:06] tired go to bed tired get up tired
[1:28:12] let me just hurry through it
[1:28:15] you see my brother and sister i never
[1:28:16] have preached i preached it down in
[1:28:18] phoenix
[1:28:19] uh their evening light
[1:28:23] but you see for every action there has
[1:28:24] to be a reaction and
[1:28:26] i would pray as we would look here and
[1:28:28] see how the power of god this
[1:28:30] come upon isaiah so strongly that he
[1:28:33] declared this is a prophet of god saints
[1:28:35] i hope that drives home to you
[1:28:37] not some common street guy is prophet of
[1:28:40] god
[1:28:40] and it come upon him so strongly that he
[1:28:43] says
[1:28:43] woe is me for i'm undone he realized how
[1:28:47] in the presence of god that his life was
[1:28:49] not
[1:28:50] uh uh uh um uh oh i'm just at loss for
[1:28:54] words
[1:28:54] his life was not he was not clean enough
[1:28:56] he he just felt dirty you might say in
[1:28:59] in before the lord and and so it comes
[1:29:02] upon him
[1:29:03] now my brother and sister for every
[1:29:04] action there has to be a reaction
[1:29:07] and i would pray tonight that there
[1:29:08] would be some constant reaction
[1:29:10] to this action not just like having a
[1:29:12] revival you know where the preacher the
[1:29:14] really good evangelist comes
[1:29:16] and preaches so strongly and so hard
[1:29:18] that moves everybody to the altar and
[1:29:20] they cry out
[1:29:21] forgive me lord forgive me lord get up
[1:29:23] and go right back to their life
[1:29:24] my brother and sister that's not what we
[1:29:26] need to do we need to recognize the
[1:29:28] value that god has given us
[1:29:29] and we need to come to a place whether
[1:29:31] it's here there
[1:29:32] yawn in the closet in the car on the
[1:29:34] ditch bank whatever it is
[1:29:36] well woe is me lord forgive me i live
[1:29:39] maybe a little two lakhs of a life
[1:29:41] amen you see it ought to be a constant
[1:29:43] reaction
[1:29:44] every reading of the word of god every
[1:29:46] time in prayer ought to be a lord if
[1:29:48] there's something in my life
[1:29:50] rooted out lord if there be something
[1:29:52] that you're not pleased with take it
[1:29:53] from me lord
[1:29:54] amen you might say a continuum as it
[1:29:57] were
[1:29:57] amen a continuum my brother and sister
[1:30:00] while this is not mathematical
[1:30:02] but something that would just come and
[1:30:04] continue it don't matter
[1:30:06] in a continuum you can have changing uh
[1:30:08] numbers you can have changing things
[1:30:10] but my brother and sister we live this
[1:30:13] word here
[1:30:13] you can say well that's 2 000 years old
[1:30:15] brother paul but i'm telling you
[1:30:17] it's the same god the same word and a
[1:30:20] different world out here
[1:30:22] but the same power that was there my
[1:30:24] brother and sister is sufficient it was
[1:30:26] sufficient then
[1:30:27] amen aren't you aren't you glad you
[1:30:29] weren't daniel come on
[1:30:35] a lot of 20th century 21st century
[1:30:38] christians would have quit praying
[1:30:44] oh this sounds a little strong doesn't
[1:30:45] it but i believe it's the truth
[1:30:49] they said well we can worship in secret
[1:30:50] just as well
[1:30:52] no what did daniel do this is the window
[1:30:55] this is where i pray i don't care what
[1:30:57] they say
[1:30:58] i'm gonna pray oh nice to meet you mr
[1:31:01] lyon
[1:31:01] daniel just went down there pranced
[1:31:03] right up to the lion tickled him pulled
[1:31:05] his whiskers rubbed his ears
[1:31:08] well that's how they tell the story now
[1:31:13] no sir i think from the very second
[1:31:17] that they said daniel you're being
[1:31:18] sentenced to the lion's den
[1:31:20] he was in travail before god lord thy
[1:31:23] will be done you imagine a heart of that
[1:31:24] say
[1:31:25] i'm fixing to become lion food lord thy
[1:31:27] will be done
[1:31:30] but also think about what it would be to
[1:31:31] be nailed to a cross
[1:31:34] no less painful actually probably much
[1:31:37] quicker
[1:31:38] to go in the lion's den as a carnal man
[1:31:41] a few swipes over
[1:31:44] but they had enough courage and they
[1:31:47] recognized the power of god
[1:31:49] in them but daniel said lord if this is
[1:31:52] the end
[1:31:53] so be it well i'll tell you my brother
[1:31:55] and sister i've seen a
[1:31:56] artist's depiction of of uh the lion's
[1:31:59] den which supposedly was so
[1:32:01] totally historically correct these lions
[1:32:04] you wouldn't want to bend that lion
[1:32:05] because them lions were scrawny
[1:32:07] they were hungry they were angry they
[1:32:09] were looking for their next meal
[1:32:11] they want some plump lying laying down
[1:32:13] there
[1:32:14] i'll tell i'll play with him like a cat
[1:32:16] with a mouse for a little bit
[1:32:17] no sir they were like that's food i want
[1:32:20] it
[1:32:21] but god come down because he knew the
[1:32:24] value he placed in daniel and the work
[1:32:26] was not done
[1:32:28] amen but if daniel had showed fear
[1:32:31] well we can't go there because he didn't
[1:32:36] but you see fear paralyzes fears what
[1:32:39] causes you not to pray when you know you
[1:32:40] should
[1:32:41] fear is what holds you back from
[1:32:43] claiming the promise
[1:32:46] hallelujah i've been rude enough tonight
[1:32:48] i guess i should move on
[1:32:51] see we're in a different time but it's
[1:32:53] still the same reaction
[1:32:54] see there's power in the name of jesus
[1:32:56] now i want to just share a quote with
[1:32:57] you
[1:32:58] i think it's really good myself
[1:33:00] hopefully it stimulates you like it
[1:33:02] stimulated that me i mean and that same
[1:33:05] power that same christ hallelujah
[1:33:07] let the fundamentals let them people who
[1:33:09] deny the power of god say it's wrong
[1:33:11] but that same power that spoke the world
[1:33:13] into existence is in those people that's
[1:33:15] got the holy ghost
[1:33:17] well right
[1:33:21] i just read you the scripture earlier
[1:33:23] amen
[1:33:26] that's right men and women it's time
[1:33:27] that we found out who you are
[1:33:30] the devil is trying to hide you back
[1:33:32] tell you that you're some little cow
[1:33:34] down
[1:33:34] something boy i mean that's what he
[1:33:37] works at my brother and sister
[1:33:38] well i just know i should i need to call
[1:33:40] the pastor call the pastor i don't mind
[1:33:42] you call the pastor call the pastor
[1:33:43] that's fine
[1:33:44] but the pastor is going to encourage you
[1:33:46] to pray about it
[1:33:47] all right you pray the prayer of faith
[1:33:50] a pastor's prayer of faith might
[1:33:52] influence you to claim something
[1:33:54] but how about you pray the prayer of
[1:33:56] faith claim something for yourself
[1:33:58] hallelujah reminds me of a story true
[1:34:02] story
[1:34:03] back east this preacher got in trouble
[1:34:05] with his denomination
[1:34:07] because he was encouraging his church he
[1:34:09] said i won't preach about you buying
[1:34:10] lottery tickets if you share it with me
[1:34:18] that must have made it better right god
[1:34:21] wouldn't have cared they were gambling
[1:34:22] because the
[1:34:23] preacher condoned it
[1:34:27] weak pulpit amen
[1:34:31] we're not little cow down things the
[1:34:32] word of god it said it
[1:34:34] we believe it we're gonna live it amen
[1:34:37] amen you're not a little cow down
[1:34:39] something you're not you are sons and
[1:34:41] daughters of god
[1:34:42] the deity is not in heaven it's in you
[1:34:47] hallelujah i know you think i'm crazy
[1:34:50] but let me tell you something brother
[1:34:52] brother
[1:34:52] knocks on the pulpit when you realize
[1:34:54] that almighty god lives in
[1:34:56] you immortal life my life i give
[1:34:59] zoe the life of god is in the human
[1:35:03] being amen we're not just talking about
[1:35:06] some kind of story
[1:35:08] and we're not talking about some
[1:35:09] theoretical thing we're talking about
[1:35:11] the word of god he said i would be with
[1:35:13] you
[1:35:14] even in you hallelujah
[1:35:17] amen amen
[1:35:23] you know it all depends on whose version
[1:35:25] of christianity you're listening to
[1:35:28] they've got jesus christ there's
[1:35:30] everything from some kind of perverted
[1:35:32] lifestyle
[1:35:34] to a a marxist
[1:35:37] socialist they've got him living on the
[1:35:40] wrong side of the tracks they've got a
[1:35:41] living
[1:35:42] whatever my brother and sister you see
[1:35:45] when they do those kind of things
[1:35:47] they're not placing value on who he is
[1:35:50] that's right and when they place that
[1:35:52] behavior and say that they have him
[1:35:55] in their life they're testifying then
[1:35:58] that his life was of sub-par value
[1:36:03] you know what i'd rather do i'm not much
[1:36:06] of a cheerleader
[1:36:08] they would have never let me been a
[1:36:09] cheerleader
[1:36:12] but what i'd like to do is just come
[1:36:14] down and cheerlead you if i could
[1:36:18] to change your vocabulary
[1:36:22] to testify i'm worth ten thousand worlds
[1:36:26] i've got the power of god i've got the
[1:36:28] grace of god i've got the glory of god
[1:36:31] i've got the holiness of god it's all in
[1:36:34] me
[1:36:34] amen oh but that just sounds way too
[1:36:37] pompous
[1:36:38] in the world of understated christianity
[1:36:41] that we have now
[1:36:43] hallelujah i've got the holy ghost how
[1:36:45] do you know that got the holy ghost
[1:36:46] i go serve in a soup kitchen
[1:36:50] real quote real quote i'm not making
[1:36:53] that up
[1:36:55] i'm serving the people so i've got the
[1:36:57] holy ghost
[1:36:58] my brother and sister the holy ghost is
[1:37:01] the life that is in that word
[1:37:03] living through you amen it's not an
[1:37:06] action you do
[1:37:07] because there's men that give tens of
[1:37:09] thousands of dollars i've shared that
[1:37:11] story
[1:37:11] about that rich guy in kansas that
[1:37:14] donated money to all them churches
[1:37:16] because he knew that the principle of
[1:37:18] paying tithe and giving to the church
[1:37:20] worked
[1:37:21] and so he didn't even believe in god but
[1:37:22] he donated money to the church
[1:37:24] and people said he's such a comments and
[1:37:26] stuff he's such a good christian
[1:37:28] the man right in the article denies that
[1:37:30] he even believes in jesus christ
[1:37:32] and they say he's such a nice christian
[1:37:34] because he helps these people
[1:37:36] come on come on
[1:37:40] oh my i got you all thoroughly
[1:37:42] disappointed tonight
[1:37:44] remember what i said to you this is
[1:37:46] supernatural so you can go home and say
[1:37:48] you've seen the supernatural tonight
[1:37:50] hallelujah and i don't see that just to
[1:37:52] be funny now i want to close with one
[1:37:54] last quote here
[1:37:56] amen sister emmy would you come the
[1:37:57] piano
[1:37:59] louis i like this i think we can all say
[1:38:03] amen to that jesus alone can lead you to
[1:38:05] that eternal life
[1:38:06] there's no church no denomination no
[1:38:09] preacher
[1:38:10] no peace priest no nothing else can lead
[1:38:13] you to it
[1:38:14] you must be led by him the only one that
[1:38:17] can lead you
[1:38:18] could you imagine him leading you out of
[1:38:21] his word
[1:38:23] which that's him amen and if he is the
[1:38:26] word
[1:38:26] and you're part of him won't you be a
[1:38:29] part
[1:38:30] of the word the word that god wants to
[1:38:32] pour the waters of salvation upon today
[1:38:35] to identify him today
[1:38:37] like the apostles identify him like
[1:38:39] luther like wesley
[1:38:40] like in the people in them days
[1:38:42] identified him this is another age
[1:38:44] it's the word the word said these things
[1:38:47] that we're seeing taking place now
[1:38:49] is predicted to take place in this hour
[1:38:52] so accept jesus christ
[1:38:53] and let him lead you to eternal life
[1:38:57] it all comes back to our lord jesus oh
[1:39:00] since somebody say thank you lord
[1:39:03] hallelujah
[1:39:04] amen in the meantime saints i want you
[1:39:07] to look in the mirror if you would just
[1:39:09] appease me
[1:39:10] and i want you to look in the mirror and
[1:39:13] remind yourself
[1:39:14] of your true value in jesus christ
[1:39:19] you see we won't get on to those things
[1:39:23] but deity has to have
[1:39:26] a dwelling place amen god could
[1:39:29] be anywhere he wanted to be but he chose
[1:39:32] to be and you and i my that ought to get
[1:39:36] us
[1:39:36] excited oh my he chose me
[1:39:39] hallelujah well you know we all have
[1:39:41] insecurities
[1:39:43] and i wasn't a bad baseball player when
[1:39:45] i was younger but i wasn't
[1:39:46] the best and i can remember that we'd be
[1:39:49] playing some
[1:39:50] baseball and it'd get right down
[1:39:54] you talk about keeping you humble as a
[1:39:56] kid
[1:39:57] get right down there's always just one
[1:39:59] extra kid it seemed like
[1:40:01] and when it come to the last player to
[1:40:03] be chose it was me
[1:40:04] or him
[1:40:09] you know what it felt like to be chose
[1:40:12] even being the last one chose
[1:40:16] there was something special but i got a
[1:40:18] complex even as a kid over and i started
[1:40:20] apologizing to the other kid and i tell
[1:40:22] him look i'll trade innings with you
[1:40:24] because i felt bad i realized i didn't
[1:40:25] know better than him
[1:40:27] they just liked me better he was kind of
[1:40:30] a cranky kid
[1:40:30] [Music]
[1:40:35] and i say that because i don't know why
[1:40:36] god chose me
[1:40:38] i don't know why he chose you but he did
[1:40:43] and let's put value in that let's lift
[1:40:46] him up and put him in that place of
[1:40:47] preeminence
[1:40:49] that he desires to be in let's not put
[1:40:51] god as secondary to our life
[1:40:53] we're doing this and we're doing this
[1:40:54] and i've got this and i'm busy and i've
[1:40:56] got a job and i've got a vacation
[1:40:58] and i need no let's put the real value
[1:41:03] in jesus christ brother jason would you
[1:41:06] come and lead us a song or two
[1:41:11] i have to tell you we were in the back i
[1:41:14] asked brother jason to
[1:41:17] pray for the service tonight and he
[1:41:19] prayed my notes
[1:41:21] and i told him he scares me uh he was
[1:41:24] just there in prayer and he just started
[1:41:26] speaking
[1:41:27] in the prayer and i was just utterly
[1:41:29] amazed
[1:41:30] amen i tell you my brother and sister
[1:41:33] i might have sounded a little harsh this
[1:41:35] evening forgive me
[1:41:37] i'm not but i think
[1:41:40] as i study as i read as i listen
[1:41:44] i think the value that we should be
[1:41:45] placing on our lord jesus christ is
[1:41:47] slowly diminishing
[1:41:49] i think that people have have just
[1:41:52] placed less value on it now than they
[1:41:54] did
[1:41:54] just a few short years ago
[1:41:56] [Music]
[1:41:58] i won't go there my i just
[1:42:01] need to stop amen lead us in a song or
[1:42:05] two brother jason
[1:42:10] there is power

[1:42:21] there is power
[1:42:25] in the name of jesus
[1:42:32] there is power
[1:42:36] in the name of jesus
[1:42:43] to break every chain
[1:42:46] break every chain break every
[1:42:51] chain oh
[1:42:54] there is power
[1:42:58] in the nave of jesus
[1:43:05] there is
[1:43:16] there is
