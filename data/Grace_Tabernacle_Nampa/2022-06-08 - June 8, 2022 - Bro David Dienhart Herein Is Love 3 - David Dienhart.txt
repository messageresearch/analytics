is there anyone here tonight that's sinless [Music] god bless you absolutely if christ is in you you know how he sees you absolutely sinless completely he that's born of god cannot commit sin because you're in the sinless one the seed that is himself is in you amen living god bless you tonight it's good to be in the house of the lord this is a building when you're here it's the house of the lord because you're the house i mean i'm glad for that aren't you and in this house god bless you let's stand together i'd like you to turn with me to the book of matthew i was tossed around and reading this because i i have a part 4 and if i don't finish part 3 i'll go to 3b so we'll have to do it that way it looks like about five parts the lord willing and it just keeps building as the word does and there's many many many quotes and things that i'd have to leave i can't even begin to touch them it's just all over and but but god is love and remember what we said remember one thing love never fails love never fails praise the lord let's bow our heads in word of prayer our heavenly father as we bow in your presence we want to thank you right now for meeting every need that's been spoken here over this destiny it's been asked for we believe it's now taking place we believe it's being manifested because you made the promise and we believe what you said and now father god we thank you for this opportunity to be assembled together and those that are listening in on the internet lord may you bless them as the word goes forth may you impart life strength and whatever they have need of not only to us present but through thy word to those that are listening in we say it in the name of jesus christ for the glory of god and now father we expect and know that these words cannot drop you said that your word was nigh us even in our mouth and because you said if you abide in me and my word and you ask what you will because it's not our will it's not even our name we're asking in your name and that you asking through us so thy will is being done now father we thank you for your word we ask you to impart it as you desire to every individual as you please and father may this word become alive in our hearts we are calling upon you for revelation that lord is more important in our lives and we begin to even imagine lord because your prophet said we are saved by revelation because revelation is the revelation of your own self your word yourself in us we thank you for that now give you praise expecting the seating and abundantly and to walk out of here closer to you because of your presence because of your word coming forth may we draw life through this filter provided for us to make a rapture in jesus name amen amen herein is love part three my subtitle here would be the word living and in action love in action the word living and in action the prophet said this bride would be and i believe she is now the word living and in action there's no other person upon the face of the earth only the bride because only in her can the mystery of himself be revealed so she is the word living he is the word living and by the same spirit she is the word living and in action it's good to see our young people back god bless you trust you had a good service a good time i should say at camp and good services amen so we i'm sure that brother paul would ask you for testimonies but we don't have time tonight so no i don't mean it that way it sounded we have time but just carry on one thing you want to do come come and come from a camp is keep feeding on the word you've got to feed your experience don't fail to forget that feed your experience amen and you'll grow in christ amen so if you'll turn with me to matthew maybe you already have 6 verse 22. i'll just read verse 21 with it for where your treasure is there your heart be also for where your treasure is now it depends what your treasure is see so where your treasure is there your heart be also the light watch how he brings us right behind it the light of the body is the eye now i want you to look at this spiritually it is natural but let's look at it spiritual the light the light god is light in him is no darkness the light of the body is the eye that's what sees okay the light of the body is the eye if therefore thine eye be single let that word single just leap out at you therefore thine i be single thy whole body shall be full of light but if thine i be evil thy whole body shall be full of darkness if therefore that light that is in the be darkness how great is that darkness now watch how he comes right behind this because he's bringing the same thing in another little parable no man can serve two masters you can't serve two and have your eyes single it's either the one or the other prophet said you're identified you must be identified in this hour you're either in christ or out of christ he said there's no halfway amen you're either in christ or out of christ there is no halfway so you can if your eye be single if thy light if the light be thine i if thy light be single i be single then your body's full of light you can't serve two masters for either you will hate the one and love the other or else you will hold to the one and despise the other you can't serve god and mammon and remember there's two powers in the world there's the power of satan by deception it's evil which is unbelief and it's a power but his power is is perversion there is upon another power which is original which we're going back to which is god's own power which is his word which is eternal for there's two powers the purity spirit of god and the spirit of the devil amen and one of those powers is motivating in everything you do everything we do every everything we say every every person everything is that's being done is motivated by one of is controlled by one of those two powers amen it's manifesting one of the two amen so i'd like you to go with me to romans you can be seated i'd like you to go with me to romans 8 14. beginning here 814 romans 8. and before i read those that scripture and read the next two after that i'd like to share with you some things the prophet has said and a few things right here first listen to what the prophet said very positive here he's not he's not stuttering with this he is he and today and today how many know you're in today this is your day this is your time this is your message and today he is now we know who he is they're talking about the lord god himself he is standing among us or jesus christ he is jesus christ the lord standing among us watch what he said now in the person of the holy ghost well brother david you said it's jesus christ i'm not talking about the man the calvary man i'm talking about god who is the word expressed in flesh that's jesus christ the same yesterday and today and forever so today he is standing among us now isn't that positive that's wonderful he is standing among us in the person of the holy ghost that person is an eternal life person eternal life is a person so it's the person that's standing among us in the person of the holy of the holy spirit which is the person of eternal life and that is what's leading the bride he's standing among us not just back here when a man when a prophet was on the scene he's standing here as the word of that prophet that prophecy has turned his turn from the prophet you can receive this to his prophecy you are his prophecy amen you are his the word spoken for the season made manifest you are the prophecy that god gave through his prophet speaking of you just if you don't believe if you don't want to accept that go back to pick up your pen and write he spoke what his prophecy was all right god did so he's so he's standing among us in the person of the holy ghost manifesting note manifesting himself more and more where coming into his church that's his bride manifesting himself more and more coming into his church making himself brother brandon used the word his self same thing himself his self known known not imagine not imagination not not something of the past he is standing among us in the person of the holy ghost manifesting himself more and more more and more greater and greater not less and less he's manifesting himself more and more coming into his church making himself not another not someone else not a church not a building but making himself known where in his church where in his church in his bride in his people in his provided place of worship now watch this they're becoming one for what if you remember on page 27 perfect faith he's pouring himself into her into the bride they are becoming one for what the wedding supper which is a celebration of a marriage all right so he's becoming one becoming one for the wedding supper making himself known revealing god see revealing god you came from revealing the god you came from as he did only as excuse me revealing god he's revealing god make himself known revealing god you came from god as he did but the only thing difference between you and jesus christ was you bypassed your theophany and you don't know all things only as god reveals himself to you but the one that's in you his spirit that became in flesh jesus never did bypass his theophany he was a man but he was first visited abraham not as jesus man but as god in flesh so he became theophany before he became the word in the flesh as a kinsman to us i mean i i hope i you understand what i'm saying okay now speaking of his church brother branham in the message um in shreveport god's chosen place of worship he called god's uh god's place of work again wait a minute god's chosen place of worship and then he he spoke of god's provided place of worship and then he said god's only that's what i'm trying to say in the in this report he said god's only provided place of worship all right then so he said only you can only worship god in the church of his choosing he said god has a church that's only a church of his choosing now he's not talking about the buildings he's not talking about this church over here in some other church over here he only you can only worship him in the church he said of his choosing he has only one church he chose for you to worship in and it's the church of his choosing his chosen place of worship you cannot worship him in another church nor will he receive your worship and have the other place rather than where he placed his name he can't now he if you're you're watching here he's remember he's standing in our midst you can't worship him in any other place but where he chose to place his name and that's the church of his choosing now i'm not we're not talking about well you take the choice of your church you choose to come here to this church he's not talking about this the church of his choosing is the mystical body of jesus christ amen that's the church of his choosing that's his body that's himself all right then and you cannot you cannot fight you cannot worship him only in that place now that's pretty straight because a lot of people are worshiping but the bible said they worship him in vain because why they're not born again amen you must be born again to be able to worship him in that place you can only come into this place through the blood and the baptism of the holy spirit you say well what is the baptism holy spirit it's the new birth the baptism of the holy spirit is the new birth all right the new birth or you are baptized by one spirit or born or birthed into that body by one spirit into one body which is christ the only place of worship all right now first corinthians 6 17 says by he that has joined unto god unto the lord he that is joined unto the lord is one spirit amen now that i pray that god will reveal that to every one of us because because when you see that you're seeing who you are not only seeing you who you are but that but that is the revelation of who you are because it's christ revealed in you he that has joined or united we're talking about union here he that is joined or united to one to the lord is that spirit remember brother jesus said himself he that is born to the flesh is flesh and he that is born of the spirit is spirit amen amen that's talking about his spirit because you're born of him you become him if you're born of him who are you you can't another hallelujah if i'm born to my father i'm his son amen is that right i'm his son i came from him i have a part of him amen i'm identified by him if you give me a blood test my blood test would prove i come from my father you give the church a real blood test it'll prove whether they came from him or not all right so you see so you realize then that's why the prophet said on on on things that are to be he said you are the spirit of god in you that's you that's what brings the body under obedience to the word is you are in that body it's you in that body he said amen all right that tells you where you come from who you are and where you're going and there's only one literature that can tell you that and that's the word but it was hid until it was opened by those seven seals and the full revelation of it was not opened until that seventh seal capped the thing off amen that's right all right now you've united now he comes right behind this and said you've he i that was when i spoke of his choosing and things that was that was what i said now i'm coming back to what he said you've united by the word you've been you've united or you've come in union by the word and the word was in the beginning is that right the word is original the word of god is original anything added to or taken from that is perversion amen so the word is original was in the beginning that word will go back to the beginning so you can't see what is time time is simply eternity space that's what time is it came down eternity came down into a hickey of time that it has to go right back into eternity again it come from god we go back to god jesus said i come from god i return back to god i bypass theophany then i'm returning to my i'm returning back to what i should have been but i came anyway into a body of flesh direct from the mind of god amen is that right but we're not conformed to the world we're being transformed by the renewing of our mind to prove what is good and acceptable and the perfect will of god all right so he said we so we and the word was in the beginning we'll go right back to the beginning and that and he said which is god and so we see there's a restoration back in our day and our time this message is a message of restoring restorating restoring to what the original eden without this message we'd never be restored back to the original again and pick up to where we left off to where we left off in the seventh day seventh day wasn't completed so we have to go back to where that left and we pick it right back up as though it never ended because eternity doesn't have the beginning it doesn't have an end but it dropped down into time but that didn't move eternity it goes right back into eternity again it just goes rolls on amen you come down here from the mind of god and the thought of god come down here in a body of flesh god said it and and you bypassed it because of the unbelief you were represented you had to be you were represented by adam and eve amen and so god knowing this would have to bring you back because it's himself he's bringing back to show forth his attributes of what he wanted and had in his mind he used the devil as a tool god can't lose anything he will not lose himself and if you were in the thinking of himself you have to be himself in this hour that's the earnest of our change and we become from this body into a new body which the word revealed in us is bringing us to so you have no fear you can let off the pressure if his word himself is revealed in you it testifies that you're in him and you have a body waiting amen amen all right so so he said because he said in that day and prophet said that day that jesus spoke of in saint john 14 20 is this day and so in that day you'll know you're not going to come to an imagination you're going to have this thing revealed to you that you came from god praise the lord and that's your and you're returning right back to god you came from god amen you were in his son and now that what was in his son is now revealed in you in the form of the holy ghost which is not another person it's god the person manifested in another form now we're coming to that in just a minute but in that day you'll know that i am in my father uh you say brother david what are you talking about i'm talking about love in that day you'll know that i'm in my father in that day this day you will know why because the seal had been opened to seal this in the book the book was a sealed book the little book of the complete revelation of of of jesus christ was sealed but it was unsealed we see who the manifestation or the mystery of god is it's you the full mystery of god is revealed in the day of the seventh angel his message his voice which is still being voiced in the days of the voice of the seventh angel the mystery of god would be finished completed full completely fulfilled so we also was found in that revelation the bible is the complete revelation of jesus christ and the book of revelation reveals that you were in him always hallelujah all right now i am in my father that that day you'll know that i am in my father the father's in me i in you who is that i eternal life god himself i in you and you in me hallelujah hallelujah i said that he said it we're here he said hallelujah we're here this is the day of that revealing hallelujah we're here and one day you'll see one day you'll see that's an individual you'll see one day you'll see that what you feel in your heart and see his identification will become personalized before you now that not only that not only is a change of our body becoming be personalized what's in me it becomes personalized but it's becoming personalized to the place of of of a of a perfect position what is my perfect position you can't go any higher than god himself which is our headstone amen he brings it right up to that position and caps the bride off amen amen she we were identified under that headstone that headstone which is love himself identifies the bride by the capping of her positioning of her amen identifying her all right much of this i have to kill hold back because i don't want to go back into part four here so one day you'll see now he said become personalized then he said then you and he are one so the personalizing himself was taking the veil off of himself and unveiled himself so we could have a full view and real life mama say that's me because when you look into the mirror of his word you're going to see who you are by seeing who he is you're seeing who you are when you look at yourself you're looking at the glory of god which is his wife which is himself all right now i'm not just saying cliches here this is real this has become this is reality that's why we're getting close to our body change now he said then you and he are one now watch what he says god will be so manifested into his bride he's not talking about a day off of here he's talking about right now to be changed to a full adoption amen to a full placing okay now god will become so manifested in into his bride his church till they will both be the same they are one now you see where we're at they are one he said now you see where we're at now it's got to come right straight back to that original ministry brother brown said the ministry of the groom and the ministry of the bride is the same amen got to become to the same ministry it's the same word it's the same spirit it's the same life it's the same person just in another form and we'll get to that in just a moment if he said now it's got to come right straight back to that original ministry that he had on that he had on earth watch what he said because it's the bride it's got to come back to the original ministry that he had on earth because it's the bride they are one see we're we're not wanting to feed you milk i don't believe the message of the hour is feeding milk it's needful that's fine but we ought to be we ought to be maturing here we keep have to have you something you can go forward towards amen all right now he said i wonder he said they are one because it's the bride they are one i wonder he said if we are sufficiently impressed with the word in our midst he said i wonder if we are sufficiently impressed with the word in our midst let me give you a thought here so i'm going to give you a thought to think on how do we pray now remember he is the word he's in our midst where is he in the bride revealing himself in the church he said i wonder if we're sufficiently impressed with the word in our midst let me give you a thought how do we pray we pray in jesus name don't we then he has to be here he's here if you pray in jesus name you're not praying in the was i was you're praying in the i am you're praying in the present tense you're referring to the person that's unveiled in you and when you ask in his name the prophet said it's him asking through you amen it's not another person it's him asking through you it's not your thought you don't pray in his name it's his name asking for the very thing that his word promised and you speak it in his name what is that it's his word in our midst he said he said we pray in jesus name don't be every prayer is in his name or there isn't any answer now matthew 6 22 as i said if your eye be single you can't separate god and the word they are one so this i that is single has a focus on one thing the eternal not the temporal while we look not at the things which are seen because if you judge yourself by the things that are seen those things are temporal you can't judge yourself by your mistakes and your failures if you're a believer if you're a christian you don't judge yourself because god will not judge yourself by what you see your mistakes your failures your reasoning your feeling he won't judge you by that he does not judge you by the way of the flesh no more that was under law you're above the law christ fulfilled the law you're not under law you're under grace the god that's in you keeps you that's all the god that's in you fulfill the law you're free you have liberty where the spirit of the lord is there's liberty of the law from the law hallelujah amen that's right that's right you can't you well i won't go any further than that i think here's that you can't separate god and the word they are one if your eye be single your body's full of light if the light of of your of your body is the eye if that eye be single then your body's full of light turn me to romans 8. let's look at verse 14 starting with verse 14. romans 8 14. so your focus is not on the temporal while we look not at the things which are seen but the things which are not seen for the things which are seen are temporal that's first that's second corinthians 4 18. all right i want to go to romans 8. for as many as are led by the spirit of god hallelujah how are you being what is being what are you being led by by god which is love okay that's love you can't go that is the height of love you god's own love it's god's own love that he placed in his own that in his seed where is love of god in his seed and that love that seed be quickened then god is quickened and brought alive in you which is the word living amen all right my subject is herein is love all right so so you you focus on the single on the one not the double because if it's evil you're going to focus on everything that's temporal you're going to focus on everything that's sensual you're going to focus on all kinds of your feeding will be on those kind of things now i'll just go further romans 8 14. for as many as are led by the spirit of god they are the sons of god they are sons what manner of love and god bespoke upon us that we should be called the sons of god for now we are sons of god what makes the sons of god many is are led by the spirit of god where's that leadership it from is it an outside leadership it's not an outside teacher where is it it's in you amen it's in the body where did i say he placed his name where is he he's in his church where is he being worshiped in his church amen you in christ where what is his church jesus christ amen we're not divided god and his word are one god and his word let me drop a little and if you be that word all right romans 8 14 and now verse 15. for you have not received the spirit i'm going to come into this further part 4 for you have not received the spirit of bondage again to fear you have not received the spirit of bondage again to fear but you have received the spirit of adoption now we could start right at the foundation of the new birth and build from faith all the way to the capstone here what is the capstone well it's adoption placing not you've already been you're already born the son you already received the seal of the holy ghost you're already born again you're already a son but you grow into him into who it's himself growing in you it's that word growing you start of an infant you grow to maturity the maturity the perfecting of that body is himself now you can see what the capstone is all right i'll just i'll just let that go because that's coming up more all right now so verse 16 again you have received the spirit of adoption so you don't have to worry about whether you're going to get adopted or not because you've already received the spirit of it hello praise the lord okay you've already received the spirit of adoption whereby we cry abba father are you going to reach the milestone are you going to go up to the full positioning of the head and the body as one unit certainly you are because you've received the spirit of adoption glory to god brother branham said you know you aren't born again then subsequent to that receive another holy spirit he said the new birth is the holy ghost baptism that starts it out you have to start infants to grow but you're still the word you are the son and you must come to perfection and god will see to it i don't care if he has to take you through a knot hole he'll get you there because you're already born his son amen amen now if you don't you just go back and listen to what the prophet said take what all he said you'll find out he said you're already noticed he said you're already his son he's got to bring you to that place what is it is it this growing no it's not to do with this growing is christ in me growing to a full stature to a perfect or a maturity now i'm going beyond myself now i don't want to go any further okay verse 16 the spirit itself now watch this you've received the spirit of adoption watch what the spirit does in you the spirit itself beareth witness with your spirit now if we go back to ezekiel you had to receive a new spirit because your old spirit wouldn't agree with god it had to be sanctified it had to be brought under submission and obedience to the word so he had to give you a new spirit to get along with him remember brother brown said to get along with him you had to have a new spirit all right because that spirit is the channel that's your heart it's a channel it's governed by imagination memory conscience reasoning affection it's a channel to either let in or let out and god uses that channel to get out to get out through your body because the soul whatever's in the soul will control the spirit and whatever's in the spirit will control the body however the spirit is controlled it will control your body amen it brings it either subject to the word or takes you away from the word if you see yourself i'm not talking about sinless perfection of the body i'm talking about the control of it you make a mistake who corrects you who says father i'm sorry i didn't mean to do that brother branham said you do that and know you were convicted he said that shows the holy ghost in you that's right and so he said now just relax he said if you do anything if you're born again and the holy ghost what is the new birth the holy ghost coming in you revel revealing himself in you you are therefore by that spirit he doesn't put the spirit in and take it away you are birthed you are absolutely sealed to the day of your redemption by that spirit but you've got to grow and you grow up into him faith has to be perfected amen matured love is matured love grows grows into what what's it going to grow into his very stature it's the stature of a perfect man well david is not a perfect man oh that was a revelation wasn't it you are not a perfect man but the one that's growing is hallelujah amen all right the further abraham got the more perfect his faith was amen all right now i've got to quit going out so far here and this it will help me verse 16 and the spirit itself beareth witness with our spirit so god giving you a new spirit that will bear witness that he can bear witness with your spirit testify give witness through you through your spirit that's how it's got to come through that channel that's why it's important that we give the word a right mental attitude bring it under obedience to the word paul said bring it under obedience bring it subject to the word that's a right mental attitude because an attitude is a placing or a positioning a right mental attitude be a right mental positioning to what to whatever you believe amen is that right but in our case it's a right mental position all right i'm not going to go into that because that's another message all right now so he bears witness with our spirit that we are the children of god so what's doing it the holy spirit is bearing fruit that we are the children of god bringing forth his own life through you and when you see that spirit in use bringing you subject to the word that's the holy spirit okay first john 4. let's go back over here and read some of these things that we have been reading and i want to begin reading here with verse 2 this time saint john or stop excuse me not saint john i say first john or first john first john 4 2. now it says in one believe but beloved that's us beloved well loved beloved believe not every spirit but try the spirits whether they are of god because many false prophets are gone out into the world now watch what he says hereby know ye the spirit of god if you try the spirit hereby know we the spirit of god every spirit that confesseth watch how he bears witness with your spirit every spirit that confesseth that jesus christ comes in the flesh is of god so it's so the holy ghost has got to bear witness with your spirit that he's made flesh in you why how because you're going to bear his life through your body amen it's not an inaction the holy ghost is action all right now and every spirit that confesseth not that jesus christ is come in the flesh i just read it to you right here today he's standing among us where in the flesh again in the person of the holy ghost all right now so he said and every spirit that confesseth not that jesus christ is come in the flesh is not of god and this is that spirit of antichrist to be an antichrist all you have to do is just leave one little portion of the word out and say it's not so for today and not be able to live that word you can shout you may dance you may do all these things anointed by the genuine holy ghost and still not have that typos or that ultimate in that soul because this is where it comes from it comes out of the soul to the spirit and the spirit gives way to that because he said bring every thought under obedience who's bringing that thought is david bringing that thought no the holy ghost in me who i am is bringing every thought under obedience to that word i'm bringing my spirit that's the thought that's the mind you don't think with your body you think with your spirit so every spirit that won't confess that jesus christ has come in the flesh it's not living that life amen bearing the wrong fruit saying i'm a believer i'm a believer but never coming to the true revelation individually that they are a believer the only one person that can bring you to that revelation that you are a believer that's the holy ghost dwelling in you and you had to be his seed in order to be that true believer you say well what what is a true believer what is a worshiper true worshiper jesus said they that worship me must worship me in spirit and in truth all right then a true worshiper is both both mechanics which you were a part of before the foundation of the world the word and the word is the is the mechanic you can have you can have your you can have your mechanics all in line you can even be filled up with gasoline which represents the word and the octane is in it but unless the holy spirit that wrote the word unless the holy spirit that gave the word unless the holy spirit comes in you and sparks that gasoline you cannot be a true worshiper you are a religious person you can mark religion you can act the message but you'll never come to the true revelation listen to what we said about revelation i'm going to come to that just a minute lord helping me he said you'll never come to that true revelation without coming into a new birth first because you cannot call jesus the christ or jesus the lord without the genuine revelation of himself being in you because you don't know it you don't know that he is you have no revelation that he is you're hoping that he is you're hoping you've come through the blood instead of having i'll come to that in a minute so let me stop right there and and let's go on further because i've got something here i want to get to now so he said here he said it's spirit of antichrist where have you heard it should come into even now which is it should come and even now already is it in the world how is it in the world it's in flesh also all right you are but watch what he said you are but you are of god little children little elect seed my offspring and have overcome them who's them antichrist spirit deception denominational spirit whatever you want to call it outside of the word of promise for this hour all right he said you have overcome them because greater is he that he is eternal life that he is god in you that he is love which can never fail that he is a person it's greater is he that is in you than he that is in the world so he that is in you is single that your eye is focused on that jesus said told those pharisees and all the rest of sadducees you're judging after the flesh you judge me after the flesh he said i judge no man. saint john 8 15 he said i do not judge a man after the flesh paul said i don't know any man after the flesh hallelujah that ought to take care of it so what's in you that is that god is looking at and realizing and judging you by how did he love jacob when jacob hadn't done anything so he couldn't judge him by his works or the lack of it he had to judge him because the seed was in jacob god planted that seed in jacob amen he loved jacob and jacob went on to have that wrestling match with god and come out a limping prince but he was changed and he had no more fear of he saw his brother coming with a multi-faceted army he didn't care what he come by he had met god and when you meet love and when you meet god he's therein in you and what do you have to fear amen he's in our midst he's in you he's coming right back to the original word you are the original word you are that original word that's what we heard today in the message of the hour was the original word the original life the original seed amen but has been sealed up and hid in the word and being hid in the word it had to be unhid you couldn't get it until it was released but it was released you came to it because your name that mystery was your name is who you are was revealed in that book hallelujah hallelujah when that mystery is revealed in you which the headstone was in the pyramid and the pyramid is the bride and it was sealed in there but it had the cap the seal the seventh seal the capstone had to be removed amen and looked inside and there's white stone what is white stone elected you also are lively stones you also are the elect amen we could go back into first peter or second peter 2 or 1st peter 2. and you would find that out it's the stone of stumbling to many it's a rock of offense but to you it's life because because it was unwritten word and what was and he said i had to go west to get the revelation of that unwritten word on that stone it was a secret there's your seventh seal it was a mystery but it's revealed it's been open but who's it open to it's only opened to her brother brahm said only she i preached on it here not too long ago only she could receive it it's only known to her her only all right so where is this bride it doesn't matter where it is and how many there is and how many there isn't are you one of them the only way you can know is god to vindicate that so to you in your life in you and when he does so you're identified to be his seed and if you're his seed there is absolutely no way you can pass away you you pass from death and to life the resurrection was great when jesus raised but how much yeah but if that was a great resurrection what about this one because you raised with him and you're identified that you raised with him what a resurrection that was but the prophet said what a resurrection this is yes because now you know you were identified in that resurrection you defeated death hell in the grave yourself i can just defeat it you've done defeated it there's no turning back from that amen amen what are we doing we're we're stabilizing we're positioning the bride here right now so we go on here now i may not read all this because i don't have time but we've read first john you can go and read it some more because god is love he that has the love of god he that's got the spirit of god is in love and perfect love casts out fear and we have in the day of judgment that we're in now herein is our love made perfect that we may have boldness in the day of judgment because as he is so are we in this world how's he going to judge us when he's already took our judgment he's already been judged perfect you are accepted you are received you are accepted in the beloved and his spirit in you identifies that you are in love you came from love you came from the source of love you came from the same source he came from amen our lord came jesus came from the same source he came from you came from amen so it's christ in you the hope of glory what is the hope of glory substance christ in you is the substance of things hoped for it's already given to you when christ comes in you everything he purchased for you calvary is yours you just have to go lay claim on it because he's already laid claim on you and said look i've already redeemed you i've given you my spirit i've laid claim on you and that settles it amen well if i just would have this up or down forget your up and down all is well when you're in christ all is well let him lead you then let go and let him lead you take him at his word when you take him at his word you crucify yourself self man's self you recursively hide the humanness you crucify you take up your cross you follow the word if your reasoning and your feelings speak contrary to the word you deny your reasoning and feelings and follow the word amen amen all right now so so i'll just i'll bypass some of that hebrews 4 12 let's go over there real quick you know we're very familiar with that scripture but i want to read it here because i want you to see it and i know you've seen it before but these things are pointed out time and time and time again why because god knows when it could be quickened it's got to go from the intellect into the revelation in your soul when it's revealed in your soul now it's substance amen it's just not something you say well i'll just try and see if it works no when it becomes substance nothing can take it out of you you've got it already you've got it just as certain as anything you'll see the manifestation of it then you have to just like a body change i've already got my body changed he said brother david now how how dare you speak that i've already done got it how do i got it substance faith it's already in that seed it's already in him my whole journey everything i need for this journey is in me including the rapture how many know the prophet said that he said everything you need in this journey when you have the holy ghost is already in you everything you need to have is already there it's given to you in your season in your time as he desires to give it to you amen and you rest in that leadership of eternal life you rest in that leadership of god brother branham said in the last message he preached outside of communion he said it's the leadership of eternal life leadership he preached on leadership oh my what a message all right all right now so we see then he says for the word of god for the word of god is quick and powerful that's why the prophet said though that that this bride would be the word living for the word of god is quick and powerful and sharper than any two-edged sword piercing even to the dividing of sunder of who you are and who you're not and of the joints and marrow and as a discerner of the thoughts and intents of the heart because whatever youth in your soul is who you are you can have all the emotions of the spirit you want you can even be a believer even love god by your spirit but if that word doesn't abide in your soul and quicken in your soul you don't know him but it had to be placed there did it wasn't you that place it there or if i could just get it if i could get it no it's what you are doing with the word now because faith that pleases god faith in you who is the real believer because remember dynamics with mechanics is true worship yes amen that's true worship no other way of true worship it's spirit and truth together that's what jesus christ is that's what he was that's what he is today is the dynamic and the attic together until the bride gets to that place dynamics alone no good he said mechanics alone no good they've got to come together to bring that car down that road and bring it into a body change or bring your body there see you can't do it in yourself amen you cannot do it in your own self you can try everything you want you can have every picture you want on the wall you can bring you can you can dress ever so right and everything and i have nothing to say about that thank god for that but to be in the bride you have to be united with him as one that's what we're after is that bride because that's who's taking the rapture that's who's going in the in the rapture amen i don't know who that is i just believe i am and how do i know i am by revelation amen because that is a substance in me i've already entered my rapture i've already been raptured how can the body not be when i've already am oh brother david i wish you'd stop talking some riddles it's not riddles it's truth it's just spiritual that's all that's why it's a new tongue it's not an untongue it's a new tongue it's speaking the new tongue that's what they did in the day of pentecost they were announcing and testifying of the word of promise for that hour they had received it and 3000 heard them in their own language what an unknown it was known to those believers because 3 000 were added to the church hallelujah we're back right back to that same pentecostal life not pentecostal religion not pentecostal shuck we're back to the original life the original faith whose faith god's own faith all right my time is slipping now watch this now i'm bypassing some of this you okay now the husband of life are okay the same spirit that was in christ is in his bride in his body that unites them together with all the word god living there himself manifesting it now now i don't have to go into this is god materializing himself the whole the whole mystery the whole manifestation of god the whole revelation of the bible is god becoming material god becoming substance god becoming material tangible could be felt could be shook hands with i could wash the feet of it of him he'd become tangible it's become flesh that god not another that god all right i'm going to bypass some of this i've already preached it god help me to realize what i preached i'm going to go back over it again all right now that makes you then his subjects that makes you his eternal subjects amen because you were in the thinking of himself you were his thoughts you were his thoughts and you imagine that so other words you were god to be from the eternities you never started either amen you say well god didn't start he didn't he has no beginning and there's no end neither are you i'm talking about his thoughts that right his thoughts that ought to settle it for you you get desperate enough and want to meet him he'll meet you you draw a night to him every day he'll draw an eye to you it depends on what you want to feed on what you're giving yourself the influence to see if our thoughts were more on him he'd appear more often when you're thinking on him well i'm sorry brother david i don't have enough time to think on him you don't have enough time to go home either so so you might as well just take your choice everybody in here is old enough to receive what i'm saying it's not a matter of how old you are it's a matter of god reveals it or not amen quickens it you know that as well as i do it's something in you you didn't put there says i need more of him i've got to have him or perish i've got to have that birthright or perish okay we should get to that place and many of them just hold on they don't we know what's the problem they don't want to die you've got to die to resurrect you've got to die to yourself you've got to give up yourself you've got to give up your habits you've got to give everything over to god die in order to be born again you have to die because a new birth is a union a new birth is a resurrection amen and then you go on and die daily because this old boy will want to raise up but he that is in you the keeping power the typos will hold you and you've got to have confidence in that hold and you will if you're elected amen because it'll constantly bring you back to that bring you back to that because god is directing it god is leading it and when you're born again if there's any little thing the prophet said you do that's not right he said he will show you so you are the manifestation you are right now today the manifestation of his thinking you were in christ in the beginning amen you anything eternal never began to not end that's why i'm saying you were eternal to begin with amen you just stepped into a body of time but you're realizing this isn't me that thought that word expressed that seed has been quickened amen who am i himself amen amen what they want to kill jesus for him being a man makes himself god he said you judge after the flesh you don't see me rich i don't have any beauty you desire you're judging after the flesh can't be of us he can't be of us he's not in our denomination he's not with our group you're judging after the outward appearance of things i don't judge that i don't judge a man after that i'm not i'm not judging you by way of the flesh amen do you believe that rest in that all right now now the seed planted you has been quickened by the baptismal holy ghost you are born again recognize that you are his attributes if you've got eternal life your life always was amen now first john 3 18 let's just now we can bypass you can read first john 1 1 through 2 when you get home those saying we've talked we've touched him we've handled him the word of life and now because he's in us we see him we're testifying of him that you too may have the fellowship we have with him that's what first john 1 1 and 2 reads now first john 3 18. first john 3 and 18. i'll probably not go much further than this i had some other things here but i'll wait and take a part 3 b all right first john 3 18 and this will come back later in part four and my little children let us not love in word neither in tongue but in deed and in truth all right little children let us not love and tongue neither in deed but in truth and hereby we know that we are of the truth and shall assure our hearts before him because there's only one that can live that and that's he and you all right now i want to share this with you and i'm closing and then i'll come back he that's in you is greater than he that's in the world god in you god in you like he was in jesus christ because what all god was he poured into christ i pray that you'll get this and all christ was which is all god was so all god was christ was and what all christ was he poured into the church there's your revelation if you can receive it there's the threefold mystery of the seventh seal all right now see that's god in you he poured into the church see he said that's god in you oh well that sure that's god in me no that's god in you he that's in you god above us the holy spirit father god with us son god in us holy ghost god above us god with us god in us amen what's the what's the capstone of this of his creation what was the capstone of of the creation of god when god brought the mystery that was hidden adam out of adam in the form of his wife amen that's right what was the capstone of god's full mystery of himself ephesians 2 ephesians 1 22 verse and 23 the church is his body ephesians 1 23 says and he the body is the fullness of himself the church is his body and verse 23 said and the church is the fullness of himself that filleth all in all so who's the fullness of himself his bride it's the full revelation of himself don't take that lightly that's where we're at we have jesus christ today as he promised before just before the rapture revealing the son of man in bright form that's what the message is about that's the message and god's trying to get this love over to you that this is love this is where he's at she can't be anything but his love expressed she can't be anything but his love manifested she cannot be anything but his love projected she cannot be anything but his love living all right because that's what he is now and it never fails i'm not throwing a wrench into that it never fails how you going to fail when you're that now you'll feel every day in this but you've got to be able to come to the fact that this is not the real you the real you is the holy spirit in you there's where you're identified you're not identified in this god doesn't even deal with you about this he uses it it's his instrument he uses it he's made flesh he's identified it he'll change it but where is he what's he doing what's who's working that nothing to do with your intellects nothing to do with your ups and downs your failures and mistakes he took all that that was under the law he condemned you under the law because you couldn't keep it but he and you will keep the word he'll keep his commandment he will keep his word you don't have to worry about keeping it david doesn't have to worry about keeping it he'll keep it so who's david subject to i'm subject to him he said he would bring your body under obedience to the word he will lead you he will guide you will he or won't he if you either believe that or you believe what your feelings are saying amen hallelujah all right now let me get through this i'm i'm done god and morphe mask in the pillar of fire god above us god in morphy in a man called jesus in morphy means he's poured himself into another mask not another god into another form all right another actor god in morphy in his man in the man called jesus god a morphy in his church god above us god with us god in us the condescending of god he was god in form same god in another mask or form not another god no wonder the winds and waves obeyed him what did they obey his words all right obeyed his words because it was god's word through him he was a man but he was the word made flesh so it was god's word through him what about the bride it's god's word through you who speaks when if you abide in me in my word and you ask what you will are we not sufficiently impressed with the word in our midst who speaks he does it's not jew does he does not david it's him it comes out of my mouth but it's him speaking it's either greater is he that is in me or isn't see there's where you've got to meet him there's where you've got to know him it's not knowing religion it's not knowing a message you have to come in relationship and union with this message to become this message unless you become this message there's no rapture because the message is the rapture and it's the going home of the bride and it's who she is all right now god through him he was a man he was word made flesh that was god above us god with us now it's god in us same god the holy spirit not the third person the same person can we visualize that can we understand that that god was in jesus christ and god was in him is now in you but he was in one man now he's in a mini-member body i have a portion you have a portion each one has a portion of him you're in your position and place he's in his position in place amen all right i'll pick up the rest of it later it's hard to leave it right now but i will let's stand i took overtime i took about i wanted to go 45 minutes that's what i wanted but i finally realized lord i have to give this to you i can't do it maybe others can preach it that way but i can't i'm not that kind of preacher so thank the lord i'm not that kind of preacher who is the preacher you passed the first test i'm just joking with you amen well that's where we ended so we'll come to that next time then when we're born of him i've got to get this part because i read first john 3 18. now listen we're closing this is it then we're born when we're born of him we are filled with him amen see your life his life is in you these are quotes now that's not something i'm just saying out of the blue then all our actions should declare him so everything we do is motivated by one of the two spirits what you wear what you do every day what you feed on let me see what you feed on the books you read and i'll tell you what's in you amen that's exactly right let me see what you look at let me see what hangs on your walls let me see what you feed on let me see the mu let me let me hear the music you're listening to and i'll tell you what's in you [Music] amen i'll tell you what's what's moving you i'll tell you what's feeding because the holy ghost will only draw through one filter and feed on the word himself and you buy that draw life to quicken that word in you further it's a continual revelation from glory to glory the walk of a believer is from from light to light light to light the light grows greater how does that scripture go from glory but there's another one path of the just is as a shining light that grows greater and greater to that perfect day now if you don't see that in your life moving living something isn't right because that's what he said he would do [Music] amen i hope that's plain enough all right hallelujah so oh my look bringing his signs of life evident of his resurrection proving to the world that eternal life [Music] and think of it alive with god our redeemer who created us for the very same purpose the church and his creative life is in you what's his creative life spoken word i heard brother neville say this morning someone might have asked him why i didn't preach on the holy ghost why i didn't do this here it is the holy ghost is the action in you it's a life not an emotion not some sort of fleshly evidence but it is a person jesus christ the what's god in you it's a life not an emotion not some sort of fleshly evidence but it is a person jesus christ the word of god established in your heart to quicken every too quick and every word of this age right he said right watch the holy ghost in action not so much in demonstrations but in action what it does according to the word [Music] there's the action he's talking about then all our action should declare him amen do you love him amen praise the lord praise the lord praise the lord amen let's sing some songs a couple two or three here before we leave thank you i appreciate you praying for my mother she had to go to emergency he had some things acting up in her body that they wanted to do one more couldn't find anything but she had a little bit of an elevated blood cell count and they want to do a cat scan and how many she's had but anyway i just believe you believe with me you're not going to find nothing amen they want to find why they want to see where that elevation is a little bit you know what it's going down it's going down to normal [Music] you believe you have what you asked for absolutely how do you know because he said so that's all i need to know he said so amen i'd like to sing these songs and i'll pick this up you pray for me god will give me another opportunity i'd like to finish out a couple more three about three more sermons all right unless the lord leads something else in christ alone in christ alone amen in christ alone in christ alone i place my trust and find my glory in the power of the wrong [Music] let it be said of me my source of strength my source of hope is christ the lord [Music] and have another verse on that christ alone i do know that yeah help me with that i i i'm not getting started right now [Music] for i've been blessed beyond measure and by his strength alone i'll overcome that's it right there holy man oh i could stop and count successes [Music] but those trophies could not equal to the grace by which i stand in price of all i place my trust and hide my glory in the power [Music] let it be set up me by source of strength [Music] in christ alone do i glory for only by his grace i am redeemed for only his tender mercy could reach beyond my weakness to my knees and now i seek no greater honor in just to know [Music] christ alone i place my trust and find my glory in the power of the cross in every big story let it be said of me my source of strength my source of [Music] hallelujah that's right amen amen let's just sing one more song not by might nor by power but by your spirit amen [Music] nor amen power but by my spirit says [Music] this mountain shall [Music] shall be [Music] not [Music] this mountain shall be this mountain shall be removed this mountain shall be removed [Music] you believe he's in the house in your house then have confidence in him he can't lead you astray he'll never lead you off the word but he will sovereignly do what he wants with you are you willing to receive it god bless you until we meet again [Music] so [Music] you
