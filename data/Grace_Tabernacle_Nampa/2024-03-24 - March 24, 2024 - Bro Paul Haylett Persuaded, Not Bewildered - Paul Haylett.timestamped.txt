[32:44] Believers let's let's just remember to
[32:46] pray for one another amen you know we we
[32:49] just we're not going to make it very far
[32:52] if we're trying to stand on our own but
[32:54] we're part of a body of Believers and
[32:56] and uh you know you don't always have to
[32:59] like your family but you have to love
[33:00] them and uh so you know just let's be
[33:04] faithful to one another you know let's
[33:06] just remember uh just thinking about our
[33:09] brother gyrus uh their little group over
[33:12] there in southern Southwest Oregon there
[33:16] um I forget what town they're in
[33:19] Roseberg Oregon just remember uh them

[33:41] their greetings we were visiting with
[33:44] brother Jose yesterday and uh they just
[33:48] desire to send their greetings and to be
[33:51] remembered in prayer and uh so just a
[33:56] few things on our heart today
[33:58] the Lord would be gracious to allow us
[34:00] to
[34:02] speak I want to speak on the thought of
[34:06] persuaded not
[34:09] bewildered amen and this kind of comes
[34:11] out a little bit of something the
[34:13] prophet said and not a little bit it
[34:16] comes out of what the prophet said amen
[34:18] not a little bit but it is and uh let's
[34:21] turn in our Bibles to the Book of Romans
[34:25] thank you musicians such love lovely
[34:28] music
[34:31] amen Romans the 4th chapter veres 20-
[34:35] 25 and as we look at this uh we just
[34:39] want to uh take this thought as Paul is
[34:42] speaking to the Romans he's making
[34:44] reference to Abraham and uh we have to
[34:48] remember that we are Abraham's spiritual
[34:52] seed and so when the word spoke and was
[34:57] given
[34:58] out that it would be as the Sands of the
[35:02] seashore he was not talking as it were
[35:04] in a direct lineage of a natural
[35:07] manifestation but talking in a spiritual
[35:10] element and um I think I declare that we
[35:14] are here today as Abraham seed amen we
[35:18] are here because of Revelation am it's
[35:22] open to us it's alive to us the promise
[35:25] is our promise and we need to have the
[35:28] confidence to stand up and claim it as
[35:31] our promise amen I believe everything
[35:34] that God LED brother brandham to reveal
[35:38] or touch on CU let's think about this
[35:41] for just a moment how much of this Bible
[35:44] did the prophet actually
[35:48] preach I like that
[35:51] answer all of
[35:53] it but
[35:55] there's literally upon the thousands of
[35:58] scriptures he never touched that's right
[36:00] but he preached all of the word amen so
[36:04] we'll find that the Bible now these kind
[36:06] of thinking would cause some people to
[36:08] say what's wrong with this guy but you
[36:10] know the Bible is a very repetitive book
[36:14] you see Jesus Christ the same yesterday
[36:16] today and forever he didn't come along
[36:18] to Le oysa and say I need to write a
[36:20] whole new chapter I need to write a
[36:22] whole new deal it's a different age it's
[36:24] a different circumstance it's a
[36:25] different people I need to do something
[36:27] now he knew the word that was in the
[36:29] beginning would be sufficient for the
[36:31] middle and the end and we are here today
[36:34] as a recipients of that word so while we
[36:36] may In Our Lifetime not hear every
[36:38] scripture of the Bible preached we have
[36:41] all of the word amen isn't that
[36:43] wonderful Romans 4:20 through2 he
[36:47] staggered not at the promise of God
[36:49] through unbelief but was strong in faith
[36:52] giving glory to God now certainly my
[36:54] brother and sister God was thinking
[36:56] about you and I
[36:58] amen this is who we are in the day that
[37:00] we live in right we're not going to
[37:02] stagger at the promise amen with
[37:04] unbelief but we're strong in faith and
[37:06] we give glory to God and being fully
[37:08] persuaded that what he had promised he
[37:11] was able to perform and therefore it was
[37:14] imputed to him for righteousness now now
[37:17] it was not written for his sake Alone um
[37:22] by I can't hardly read my
[37:23] own not written for his sake alone that
[37:26] it was imputed to him but for us also to
[37:29] whom it shall be imputed if we believe
[37:31] on him that raised up Jesus our lord
[37:35] from the dead who was delivered for our
[37:37] offenses and was raised again for our
[37:40] justification Heavenly Father we ask for
[37:43] your blessing upon the word today touch
[37:45] each life those present those not
[37:47] present father you know every
[37:49] circumstance we ask you Lord to deal
[37:51] kindly let our lives father be anointed
[37:54] Lord to respond to the word to manifest
[37:57] every word of God for our day every life
[38:00] father Lord we thank you in your name
[38:03] amen you may be
[38:11] seated to be
[38:14] persuaded is
[38:17] to be caused to believe and we look at
[38:22] this and the Apostle Paul speaking of
[38:25] these promises concerning Abraham which
[38:27] were not just to Abraham but to were you
[38:30] and I H it is that we truly can today
[38:33] can say we're fully persuaded now if we
[38:36] were persuaded by a man if someone come
[38:39] and laid out such a very carefully
[38:42] crafted uh Direction Through the word of
[38:45] God and laid that out and you were
[38:47] persuaded that what he had just laid out
[38:49] before you was the truth uh without
[38:52] Revelation without anointing of the Holy
[38:54] Spirit another man could come and
[38:56] equally well present something that
[38:58] would persuade you and it is there that
[39:01] we stand here as in verse 21 fully
[39:04] persuaded is because this did not come
[39:07] to the flesh man that did not come to
[39:09] our intellect it did not come to our
[39:11] knowledge but it come by revelation of
[39:14] who we are just as it was with Abraham
[39:17] he come now when you read the word and
[39:19] you look at Abraham's life you'll see
[39:21] that there were things in Abraham's life
[39:23] that we would stop and say but but that
[39:25] seemed like he was questioning or he dis
[39:27] believed or he whatever but God was
[39:30] looking down below the level that man
[39:32] can look and knew that down in the
[39:35] depths of Abraham's heart he was fully
[39:38] persuaded amen that it was not the
[39:41] flesh's reaction you know In the Flesh
[39:44] they have this uh this theorem if you
[39:46] would call it it's called Fight or
[39:48] Flight and you'll see that in the
[39:50] personality of human nature that some
[39:52] people they will avoid controversy uh no
[39:56] matter what at all cost
[39:57] and others uh when they are threatened
[40:00] as it were they rise up and they're
[40:02] going to stand their ground and you'll
[40:04] see that my brother and sister that it
[40:07] is in the human nature that we'll find
[40:10] how God can look beyond that nature Can
[40:13] someone say thank you Lord look beyond
[40:16] that nature and see who we really are
[40:19] underneath that we might be one that
[40:21] would not want to stand in controversy
[40:24] until it comes to the day that we can't
[40:26] back up up when we have to stand Satan
[40:29] would say boo we say boo right back to
[40:31] him because we can't back up amen it
[40:34] might have been that we were a certain
[40:36] way the entirety of our life but the day
[40:39] comes that God puts us into circumstance
[40:41] and there's something in us and I say
[40:44] thank you Lord for Faith amen that we
[40:46] can stand on the word and say I'm no
[40:48] longer backing up I'm going to stand
[40:50] right here it is not about whether we've
[40:53] made mistakes or not it's not about how
[40:56] smart we are or Rich we are or whatever
[40:59] it is but it's God looking down through
[41:01] the very depths of our humanity and
[41:04] knowing what he has placed in us and I
[41:07] say thank you Lord for what you have
[41:08] placed in US amen
[41:11] hallelujah acts 26-
[41:15] 28 we see here
[41:17] Paul is
[41:19] speaking to Agrippa fesus and others
[41:24] that were there in the court and we see
[41:27] how that he is there the scripture says
[41:30] that he's persuading them he's speaking
[41:33] to them concerning these things and
[41:36] Agrippa said unto Paul almost thou
[41:39] persuadest me to be a Christian now my
[41:42] brother and sister AG gria could not be
[41:44] persuaded because he did not have that
[41:47] seed Gene in him to believe but I tell
[41:50] you how convincing uh the Apostle Paul
[41:53] was in his preaching and witnessing
[41:56] testimony of of the word was even an
[41:59] unbeliever was Almost Persuaded to
[42:03] believe that's a powerful testimony
[42:06] that's a power and demonstration of the
[42:08] holy spirit in their midst that an
[42:10] unbeliever would be there saying I am
[42:13] right on the very borderline of
[42:15] believing what you're saying but what he
[42:18] would have finished if he would was
[42:20] there's just nothing in me to go ahead
[42:23] and take that and make the next step
[42:25] it's not there
[42:27] I can't do
[42:29] it but when you look at this we see they
[42:33] thought that by much learning it had
[42:35] caused Paul to be almost mad they looked
[42:38] at him and what were they looking at
[42:40] they weren't looking at a man that was
[42:42] crazy in his behavior but they were
[42:44] looking at a man that was so on fire so
[42:47] convinced so uh uh revelated in the idea
[42:51] and it was so real now my brother and
[42:53] sister I believe that that what was done
[42:56] was partly because uh the Apostle Paul
[42:59] his testimony his sincerity was so
[43:02] powerful that they couldn't help but
[43:05] believe it they saw that it was real
[43:07] they saw it was a passion it wasn't just
[43:10] religion it was real amen and they were
[43:13] there looking at that and they knew
[43:14] there was something behind that because
[43:16] as it were the fire of humanity cannot
[43:19] burn that bright without something
[43:21] behind it feeding the fire amen and they
[43:25] also Paul's reply to them and I really
[43:28] like this this was not done in a
[43:34] corner my brother and sister I want you
[43:36] to think about this we live in a world
[43:40] right now unfortunately breaks my heart
[43:43] many people have come and gone through
[43:45] the years many people have said this is
[43:47] not for me and went on into a a whole
[43:50] different life but my brother and sister
[43:52] regardless of what others have chose to
[43:54] do what God did in your life what he did
[43:57] in my life was not done in a corner he
[44:00] did this right out in the open amen we
[44:03] never glorify those things but there was
[44:05] the unbeliever and the make believer the
[44:08] drunk and the Harlot and everything you
[44:10] can think of and God changed their lives
[44:13] and those who knew that life knew there
[44:16] was a true and honest change it was not
[44:19] just a coding of religion which is a
[44:21] covering but it was the truth a life
[44:24] that had come forth and it's there that
[44:26] God said I don't need to hide in the
[44:28] corner I will make it a public display I
[44:31] don't need to do uh uh things in such a
[44:34] fashion to to just make them kind of
[44:36] camouflaged in the world I'm going to
[44:38] call you to be set apart I'm going to
[44:41] call you to stand out I'm going to call
[44:43] you to be awkward to this world I'm
[44:46] going to call you to be something
[44:47] different and my brother and sister this
[44:49] is God not allowing the word to hide in
[44:51] the corner but every grocery store visit
[44:54] every time here and every time there
[44:57] wherever you're at God's putting you the
[44:59] bride of Christ on display because it's
[45:02] not going to be in a corner it's going
[45:04] to be alive it's going to be well and
[45:05] it's going to be out before them
[45:08] hallelujah amen you see my brother and
[45:11] sister I I'll just if I can go on a rant
[45:13] for just a moment is it okay just for a
[45:15] moment brief moment my brother and
[45:17] sister you know I've mentioned in this
[45:19] church before that sometimes I become a
[45:21] little bit uncomfortable with the the
[45:24] terminology we're believers
[45:29] we're Believers in
[45:32] what the Buddhist is a
[45:37] Believer name any religion you want
[45:39] they're
[45:41] Believers amen and even the word
[45:43] Christian has become very generic but
[45:46] it's who we are amen amen I don't care
[45:49] how many false Christians there are
[45:52] there's Christians on the earth and
[45:53] we're not in a corner we're out in the
[45:55] open we're in the work place we're in
[45:57] the family we're in the store that we're
[46:00] wherever because God said I'm going to
[46:02] have real people that are going to be
[46:04] like me amen I I don't need to hang a
[46:07] tag on them because when you look at
[46:08] this I know this is going to sound bad
[46:10] for me but when you look at this brother
[46:12] brandham talks about how when when Jesus
[46:14] calls them and they're there they won't
[46:16] be identified as Nazarene and Baptist
[46:19] and Methodist and this and that my
[46:21] brother and sister and we won't be
[46:22] identified as
[46:24] message we'll be identified by our
[46:27] relationship that we have with Jesus
[46:29] Christ and Christ Alone amen there is no
[46:32] umbrella called message that we're going
[46:34] to hide under my brother and sister it
[46:37] is that personal relationship and when
[46:39] Paul stood before a grippa fesus and all
[46:43] of them and started testifying of Jesus
[46:45] Christ he didn't point to a church he
[46:48] pointed to the Lord Jesus Christ he said
[46:51] that's who I follow that's who has
[46:53] anointed my life that's my protection
[46:56] that's that's my strength that's my
[46:58] provider and he can be yours too
[47:01] agria and it was so powerful AG grippa
[47:04] was like you almost got me here I'm
[47:06] almost ready to accept this but wait
[47:09] I've got position I've got Authority
[47:11] I've got an image I must uphold I'll
[47:13] tell you there's an image I want to
[47:15] uphold amen the image Amen in the very
[47:18] likeness of Jesus Christ the word that
[47:21] is spoken the word from the original
[47:24] coming right down Through the Ages
[47:25] coming alive in every generation Can
[47:28] someone say thank you Lord that it's
[47:30] alive in every generation it didn't say
[47:34] I don't know what I can do in the middle
[47:35] I'll just skip to the
[47:37] end no sir every generation's had a true
[47:41] witness every Generations had its a
[47:44] grippa yes
[47:48] sir and this generation is not
[47:52] Exempted there's got to be someone with
[47:56] revelation
[47:57] and sincerity filled with the Holy Ghost
[48:00] that stand in this generation and
[48:02] witness Jesus Christ in the same
[48:04] Authority we believe the Apostle Paul
[48:06] was called as a prophet uh Apostle to
[48:09] that age right that's who he was but my
[48:11] brother and sister what Christ poured in
[48:13] him he's poured in you amen amen he
[48:16] didn't have a different different thing
[48:17] for their day so what God has done is
[48:20] poured into us in this day the power of
[48:23] the word living word that has brought it
[48:25] alive that we can can have that same
[48:27] influence we can have that same uh uh
[48:30] presentation of the Gospel of Jesus
[48:33] Christ and my brother and sister it
[48:34] isn't our flowery words it isn't our
[48:36] education and all the big words that we
[48:39] could use and do whatever it's a life
[48:41] and when that life is on display even
[48:44] the devil can't argue with that
[48:47] life
[48:49] amen but we got to look be on flesh amen
[48:52] that's right you know when the scripture
[48:55] said if our hearts condemn us not
[48:58] it wasn't just talking about a
[48:59] superficial thing my brother and sister
[49:02] when your heart knows who you are amen
[49:07] not your mind that's right when your
[49:09] heart knows who you are then you have
[49:12] confidence to put Christ on
[49:18] display no we're not putting Christ on
[49:20] display when we hand out a book
[49:23] sir you are the display amen
[49:29] amen I just love that very very
[49:32] infatuated as I study this thought out
[49:35] about it not being done in a corner I I
[49:38] I I love this I I recently
[49:41] read a little deal was a criticism of
[49:44] the
[49:45] message it's strange that you can find
[49:47] satisfaction reading
[49:49] that because one person writes and says
[49:53] you don't have to worry about them
[49:55] there's only a few of them around
[50:00] Jeffersonville and I was like isn't
[50:02] amazing what God can
[50:04] do he'll hide them all over the world in
[50:08] plain sight
[50:13] amen hiding Us in plain sight
[50:19] amen so much so that people I was at a
[50:22] wedding sister Jerry and I went to a a
[50:23] wedding a funeral H they're both the
[50:26] same
[50:28] [Laughter]
[50:33] sorry about
[50:35] that we were in a funeral yesterday and
[50:38] had many many ex- Believers there people
[50:41] I grew up with people I knew for
[50:47] years and okay I'm not even going to put
[50:50] a prefigure this is not judgmental I'm
[50:52] just going to say
[50:54] it some of them were just talking about
[50:56] about how wonderful their life
[50:59] is I'm not even going to paint a picture
[51:02] for you of what their life looks like
[51:04] right now they're just
[51:07] telling me how wonderful their life
[51:12] is but there's nothing about the Wonder
[51:16] on display yeah
[51:22] it I visited with a lady she never she
[51:25] her sister was in the message at one
[51:27] time she was there lovely lady very
[51:29] lovely
[51:31] lady and as we're
[51:34] visiting she goes well how do you know
[51:37] my sister and I said well it goes all
[51:40] the way back into my
[51:42] childhood and this and she suddenly her
[51:45] eyes of understanding start to
[51:51] open now what do you guys follow what
[51:56] wasn't it some little
[52:02] book yes it's called the
[52:08] Bible
[52:09] oh I believe the
[52:12] Bible me too amen me
[52:16] too you
[52:18] see what is
[52:21] promoted what is
[52:23] presented what is offered up
[52:28] can be construed as what you believe
[52:31] that's
[52:34] right let me put it to you this
[52:38] way what you believe came directly out
[52:42] of the word of God amen
[52:44] amen not man's ideas not man's
[52:48] presentation amen what would we have to
[52:51] offer today to AG
[52:54] gria so and so
[52:57] said oh King Agrippa so and so
[53:01] said and this one over here said and
[53:03] this one thought this no sir the Apostle
[53:06] Paul's standing there in front of AR
[53:08] grippa he is presenting Jesus Christ
[53:12] nothing but Christ he's not offering an
[53:14] antidotal type of a sermon not an
[53:16] antidotal type of thought he is offering
[53:19] a fresh view at Jesus Christ not a a a
[53:23] history not something in the future he's
[53:26] off offing something very present right
[53:28] at the moment for them to look at and
[53:30] say this is what's real and this is what
[53:33] is coming to pass and this is what is
[53:35] prophesied and you need to believe it
[53:38] and it was powerful enough to change the
[53:40] point of view of AG grippa except for
[53:42] there was nothing in him to hold to it
[53:44] so my brother and sister it has come
[53:47] amen that God today is not doing it in a
[53:50] corner he's doing it right out in the
[53:52] open he's doing it right in the face of
[53:55] the world today he's doing it in such a
[53:57] fashion but look I want to present this
[53:59] to you in a in a nice kind way my
[54:02] brother and sister the word said that
[54:04] their eyes would be dimmed and their
[54:05] hearing would be dull and it's there
[54:08] that you have people good sincere people
[54:11] but they just can't grasp that there's a
[54:14] higher calling they cannot grasp that
[54:16] God has something more for them they
[54:18] cannot grasp that there is a life beyond
[54:21] this life right here they speak the
[54:23] words they talk about it they make
[54:25] reference to it but without a revelation
[54:28] because if a grippa could manufacture
[54:30] Revelation he would have went down in
[54:32] scripture as a
[54:34] Believer but he couldn't that's right
[54:37] and in the world today my brother and
[54:39] sister there is this whole presentation
[54:42] of what it is and and you know they they
[54:44] would talk of being persuaded but how
[54:47] come they're
[54:49] bewildered how come they're bewildered
[54:51] my brother and sister you can talk about
[54:53] the word and yet they will say um now do
[54:57] I remember um the Bible does say
[55:00] something about
[55:03] prophets if you read your Bible you know
[55:05] it says something about Prophets You
[55:07] don't have to guess but you see because
[55:10] of the age that we live
[55:11] in the hearing the
[55:15] vision they're just like a grippa right
[55:18] they're almost persuaded amen they
[55:21] almost are ready to step over the line
[55:24] and make a full commitment but but can't
[55:27] quite do it amen I think we have
[55:30] something to praise the Lord for today
[55:32] can we just give the Lord a little thank
[55:34] you thank you Lord
[55:37] Jesus amen we come face to face with
[55:40] that word and we weren't Almost
[55:42] Persuaded we were completely totally
[55:45] persuaded this is God's word and here is
[55:48] our foundation and here is the promise
[55:50] and I'm claiming the promise every bit
[55:53] of that promise my promise amen amen
[55:56] amen and then God puts you
[55:59] out takes you out of the corner you know
[56:03] personality
[56:05] wise a lot of us would just like hang
[56:07] out in the corner corner quietly we
[56:10] wouldn't put ourselves out but God knows
[56:13] how to put us out amen God knows how to
[56:16] put a
[56:17] love for friends neighbors people he
[56:21] puts a love in there and the love is
[56:23] what causes you to step out like Apostle
[56:25] Paul I can say this morning Apostle Paul
[56:28] loved Agrippa and he loved him enough to
[56:30] give the word to
[56:32] him
[56:38] amen had an individual not that long ago
[56:41] talked to me about where's the line of
[56:44] us putting the word the Pearl before the
[56:49] swine and we have to stop and think
[56:51] about that we're like well they're
[56:53] unbelievers they're unbelievers I don't
[56:55] want to put put the word out there
[56:57] because you don't know that's right you
[57:01] don't know if the man's Blasphemous you
[57:03] don't put the word in front of a
[57:04] Blasphemous angry man but my brother and
[57:07] sister let God do that sorting follow
[57:09] the leadership right be instant in the
[57:12] season but you know to be instant in the
[57:15] season we have to be in tune with the
[57:17] one who is the season and if we aren't
[57:19] in tune with the one who is a season
[57:22] we'll go I don't know if I should have
[57:23] or I shouldn't have you should have a
[57:25] confidence to know whether you should or
[57:27] shouldn't you should have a confidence
[57:29] Lord are you leading me to speak and be
[57:32] able to have a confidence that I was
[57:34] called to share this gospel to live this
[57:36] gospel to be a convincer a
[57:40] Persuader amen because you got to
[57:43] realize taking this from this scripture
[57:45] you can't convince a
[57:48] grippa if agrippa's got nothing to be
[57:52] convinced of
[57:55] Amen no don't go throw the word out
[57:57] front of them to watch them tear it
[57:59] apart and throw it in the
[58:00] trash but don't be afraid Amen to plant
[58:04] the seed
[58:10] amen I have a beautiful analogy but I'll
[58:13] refrain from using
[58:14] it
[58:16] amen see if you're going to cause
[58:18] someone to
[58:20] believe then you leave
[58:22] out all of the other factors that are in
[58:25] Scripture predestination Revelation so
[58:28] if I can just
[58:30] convince amen I get them in the mail all
[58:32] the time I don't know if any maybe it's
[58:34] just because of the church or I don't
[58:35] know but I get these flyers all the time
[58:38] maybe you do the giant postcards we're
[58:40] holding a deal down here at this
[58:41] convention center uh you know come we're
[58:45] going to give you
[58:50] Revelation I thought about going because
[58:52] I wouldn't mind having more Revelation I
[58:54] want to see just what they had to give
[58:56] but then I flipped the card over and
[58:57] read the backside and I should be a
[58:59] featured speaker at their
[59:01] conference because they are coming oh
[59:05] this sounds bad but they're coming and
[59:07] they are giving them
[59:11] milk we're meat people aren't
[59:13] we amen we're meat people amen not
[59:18] strong milk not strong you know but meat
[59:21] my brother and sister the meat is for
[59:23] the mature and and God does that and I'm
[59:26] not TR do a rally rally thing this
[59:28] morning but I want you to understand how
[59:30] far God has brought you down this road
[59:33] of Revelation it is not just a beginning
[59:35] it's not just a first step you are far
[59:38] down the road of Revelation because God
[59:40] said you will be ready when I come you
[59:43] will be filled with the word you'll have
[59:46] the life you'll have the nature you'll
[59:48] have the love you'll have it all when I
[59:50] come cuz I have not missed a one I will
[59:53] not miss a one and God is there
[59:56] powerful the devil's just got a lot of
[59:59] distractions do you guys ever get
[1:00:00] distracted amen you know here here
[1:00:03] recently I I only use this for an
[1:00:05] example But Here recently I I got down
[1:00:07] to the end of the day and I thought my I
[1:00:09] haven't done anything and then I was
[1:00:12] like oh I was supposed to return a call
[1:00:13] to so and so and I started scrolling
[1:00:15] back through my phone uh that's probably
[1:00:18] oldfashioned way to do it but that's how
[1:00:19] Paul does it you know scrolling back 41
[1:00:22] phone calls in one
[1:00:23] day no wonder I didn't get anything
[1:00:26] thing
[1:00:27] done some of them were friends and I was
[1:00:31] probably guilty of yakking too long but
[1:00:33] still my brother and sister isn't
[1:00:34] amazing that when we can get right on
[1:00:36] the custom of getting something from the
[1:00:38] lord the devil has all kinds of
[1:00:40] distraction he just takes a bucket full
[1:00:41] of distractions and pours them out on
[1:00:43] the
[1:00:44] floor
[1:00:46] amen when I was a kid I had quite a few
[1:00:48] of them Jacks you know the little the
[1:00:50] little star things with the little balls
[1:00:52] on the ends you know I had quite a
[1:00:54] collection of those Jacks and and then
[1:00:56] um my dad got up in the middle of the
[1:00:57] night one night and I didn't clean him
[1:00:59] up like I was supposed to and by the
[1:01:01] next morning I had no
[1:01:02] Jacks amen because when my dad stepped
[1:01:05] in the first one you know you take the
[1:01:07] next Quick Step and there was more Jacks
[1:01:09] there and by the time he got done with
[1:01:11] that at middle of the night he turned
[1:01:12] the light on took out a broom and my
[1:01:14] Jacks disappeared now my brother and
[1:01:16] sister that's what Satan's doing to you
[1:01:18] and I he's dumping out all kinds of
[1:01:21] distractions to keep us from coming with
[1:01:24] a confidence because our time is
[1:01:26] consumed in other factors other things
[1:01:28] and our lives are consumed with we have
[1:01:30] this stress we have that stress you know
[1:01:32] what most of that is most of us called
[1:01:35] Drama any of you have courage enough to
[1:01:38] admit you have drama in your life yeah
[1:01:41] drama yeah the devil loves
[1:01:44] drama he loves drama my brother and
[1:01:47] sister God deals in facts amen God
[1:01:50] doesn't deal in drama God deals in
[1:01:52] facts and Paul is talking to a grippa
[1:01:55] and and he's laying out the list of
[1:01:58] facts and not one of those facts was
[1:02:00] attend our church and you'll make
[1:02:02] it not one fact was there if you will
[1:02:06] just be our friend you'll be okay every
[1:02:09] one of those facts was rooted in Jesus
[1:02:12] Christ having died and resurrected amen
[1:02:16] and was living forever more and that was
[1:02:19] something that they could not quite
[1:02:21] grasp it's something that maybe even we
[1:02:23] could admit without God we could not
[1:02:25] Gras
[1:02:26] but the word my brother and sister
[1:02:28] cannot live in a realm of unbelief it
[1:02:30] cannot live in the realm of death it
[1:02:32] cannot live in a realm where the
[1:02:34] resurrection is not first and foremost
[1:02:36] amen amen amen that's right we talk
[1:02:39] about Easter celebrate the resurrection
[1:02:42] my brother and sister we should be
[1:02:43] celebrating the resurrection every
[1:02:45] single day of Our Lives amen he's raised
[1:02:48] us from death unto life
[1:02:51] hallelujah amen and I can say today I'm
[1:02:54] so glad God came to my
[1:02:56] corner amen amen not just that we came
[1:03:00] to church but God came to us right
[1:03:02] brother brand lays it out very clearly
[1:03:03] no man has come to God but God comes to
[1:03:06] man amen and I'm glad he came to my
[1:03:08] corner I'm glad he came to my household
[1:03:11] I'm glad he came to my life because
[1:03:13] without that the devil would be here
[1:03:15] saying I'll let you be cloaked in your
[1:03:17] religion I'll let you be cloaked in what
[1:03:19] you think you believe I'll let you be
[1:03:21] cloaked in anything uh that pertains to
[1:03:23] that world but if you don't have an
[1:03:26] absolute anchor and it's not there I
[1:03:28] don't have to worry about you you'll be
[1:03:30] the shock brother Brandon put it this
[1:03:32] way the drunk will not be shocked that
[1:03:34] he gets sent to Hell amen the unbeliever
[1:03:37] will not be shocked but it will be the
[1:03:40] make believer the guy who thought by
[1:03:42] attending church the guy who thought by
[1:03:44] the fact he believed a certain thought
[1:03:46] that it would be okay that's the one
[1:03:48] that's the one that'll be shocked and
[1:03:50] I'm glad my brother and sister God came
[1:03:52] to our corner and said I'm going to show
[1:03:54] you what real faith is I'm going to show
[1:03:56] you what real power in the word is I'm
[1:03:59] going to show you the formula for having
[1:04:01] your prayers answered I'm going to show
[1:04:03] you for the path that you will walk and
[1:04:05] it's going to get narrower and narrower
[1:04:08] and narrower and narrower and sometimes
[1:04:11] we get uncomfortable with how narrow God
[1:04:13] has called us to walk but my brother and
[1:04:16] sister lift up your eyes your
[1:04:17] redemption's drawing nigh amen he's
[1:04:20] called us to walk that way he's made it
[1:04:23] possible he's given us the strength and
[1:04:25] the vision amen amen that's right or we
[1:04:28] can settle for religion no
[1:04:31] sir
[1:04:38] sir I want to be careful what I'm saying
[1:04:41] don't get too carried away but I'll tell
[1:04:42] you my brother and
[1:04:45] sister in some parts of the
[1:04:47] country divorce and the ranks of
[1:04:50] marriage people is equal to the world
[1:04:54] exactly right
[1:04:56] can someone offer a reason
[1:05:04] why oh King AG
[1:05:08] grippa our pastor
[1:05:12] says oh King of
[1:05:16] grippa the Bible
[1:05:20] says but by experience they've never
[1:05:22] seen it
[1:05:24] happen
[1:05:28] oh king of
[1:05:30] gria God's real amen and he's here amen
[1:05:34] and the same signs that he performed is
[1:05:38] still here they haven't left there's
[1:05:40] still a holy ghost there's still a word
[1:05:43] there's still a life and there's still a
[1:05:45] people that are going to hold on to this
[1:05:47] word and not depart from it a grippa you
[1:05:50] can throw us in prison you can torture
[1:05:52] us you can do whatever you want but
[1:05:54] we're still believers amen
[1:06:00] amen sometimes it's good for
[1:06:04] us reminds me maybe this makes sense
[1:06:07] maybe it don't but it reminds me one
[1:06:09] time of this lady true story she had all
[1:06:13] these beautiful roses and she said I'm
[1:06:15] going to tear my roses
[1:06:18] out and I was working with a guy who
[1:06:20] built retaining walls and stuff and and
[1:06:23] and uh hard labor you know but we we
[1:06:25] would go in and and do these things and
[1:06:28] and he's telling him what will you just
[1:06:30] tear my roses out and he like they're
[1:06:31] beautiful roses why do you want them
[1:06:32] tore out every time I get around the
[1:06:35] Roses when I get around the Roses I
[1:06:37] break out in
[1:06:40] hives and the first thought was well
[1:06:42] maybe you're allergic to
[1:06:44] roses but the man I work for goes out to
[1:06:47] all these huge rose beds and there's
[1:06:50] poison ivy growing everywhere in the
[1:06:53] midst of the
[1:06:54] Roses
[1:06:56] now I hope you follow me without a
[1:06:59] deeper look it's the Rose's
[1:07:05] fault and the prophet of God said the
[1:07:07] devil goes to church yes sir so without
[1:07:10] a deeper look that's right we'll think
[1:07:12] it's something about church that's it
[1:07:15] amen but the devil's in the midst amen
[1:07:18] the poison ivy was in the mid guess who
[1:07:20] got to cut all the poison ivy out of
[1:07:22] those rose bushes yes it was okay if
[1:07:25] Paul did that but it was fine the little
[1:07:28] old lady you know was just so so happy
[1:07:31] she was overjoyed she loved her roses
[1:07:34] but with a false conclusion she was
[1:07:36] going to get God out of her
[1:07:39] life it's a conversation I had with a
[1:07:42] lady
[1:07:47] yesterday she looked me in the eye and
[1:07:49] said
[1:07:50] Paul I'm trying to get God back in my
[1:07:55] life
[1:08:00] life can I speak
[1:08:03] stronger don't try do that's
[1:08:07] it don't try do that's
[1:08:11] right don't try to love your
[1:08:15] neighbor do that's it
[1:08:18] amen don't try to be in the word do
[1:08:21] that's
[1:08:23] right don't try to be faithful in the
[1:08:26] house of God
[1:08:29] do maybe that's straightforward forgive
[1:08:31] me but it's truth amen amen see what
[1:08:36] God's doing today wasn't done in a
[1:08:38] corner don't you love that I went on the
[1:08:40] internet the other day and just typed in
[1:08:42] brother bram's
[1:08:44] name it's a very interesting thing the
[1:08:48] very first things to show up were he was
[1:08:50] a good man but went
[1:08:52] off oh he he was a Deceiver he was this
[1:08:56] go ahead just move down a page or
[1:08:59] two and you start to read headlines of
[1:09:04] healing
[1:09:06] Deliverance urrent we're not talking
[1:09:08] about 50 years ago 60 years ago 70 years
[1:09:11] ago we're talking about now amen but you
[1:09:14] see the devil to those who won't dig in
[1:09:18] how many of you ever studied that way
[1:09:20] before maybe for a class had to write a
[1:09:23] paper surely I wasn't the only
[1:09:27] one I don't know if they call it
[1:09:28] plagiarizing when you just write down
[1:09:30] the very words right out of an
[1:09:31] encyclopedia word for
[1:09:34] word it used to
[1:09:38] work but you see God did not call us to
[1:09:42] confusion or chaos that's right God
[1:09:44] called us to the word that's right amen
[1:09:46] he called us to be persuaded and it's
[1:09:49] not what somebody else says about it but
[1:09:51] I stand here as we can say today devil
[1:09:55] you're too late we have heard the word
[1:09:59] we have believed the word and we've saw
[1:10:01] the word come in action in our life he's
[1:10:04] our healer he's our deliverer he's our
[1:10:07] provider he's our peace and comfort he's
[1:10:10] everything Can someone say Amen to that
[1:10:12] this morning it's too late devil amen
[1:10:15] and no matter who spoke to AG grippa
[1:10:18] Agrippa looked Paul in the eyes and knew
[1:10:20] that what Paul was sharing was the truth
[1:10:22] because he was sincere in the word amen
[1:10:26] and so it is that it come to our corner
[1:10:28] and I'm glad it came to where we are
[1:10:30] amen now to some it comes as
[1:10:37] confusion to some it comes as
[1:10:43] chaos I have confusion in my
[1:10:46] life I have chaos in my
[1:10:50] life but it didn't come from the word
[1:10:52] that's
[1:10:53] right are you with me amen the confusion
[1:10:57] and Chaos in my life did not come from
[1:10:59] God did not come from this message amen
[1:11:03] it come from the devil amen amen and
[1:11:06] he's there in causing this chaos and
[1:11:09] confusion amen he's trying to distract
[1:11:12] us he cannot do away with the truth as I
[1:11:15] spoke in the church here recently my
[1:11:17] brother and sister you'll see all
[1:11:18] through the message through the
[1:11:19] scripture how that it was there in
[1:11:21] heaven the very thing that got Lucifer
[1:11:24] was the fact that he wanted to be at or
[1:11:29] higher than the
[1:11:32] word he wanted a
[1:11:35] preeminence on attention attraction the
[1:11:42] praise our Lord Jesus
[1:11:45] Christ he's standing there on the earth
[1:11:48] and he could have easily have said
[1:11:51] worship
[1:11:54] me
[1:11:56] when an angel
[1:11:57] come spoke to
[1:12:01] John they start to bow down what does he
[1:12:04] tell
[1:12:05] them worship God that's
[1:12:09] right that's what I want you to do I
[1:12:11] want you to stop all this I want you to
[1:12:12] worship God Amen a prophet stood in this
[1:12:16] day and he's there and people started to
[1:12:18] worship and lift him up make deity out
[1:12:20] of him which is not all that far removed
[1:12:23] amen and neither is it to say that you
[1:12:26] are deity all that far removed amen but
[1:12:29] he says no I am not amen I am not who
[1:12:34] you're trying to make me out to be he
[1:12:36] tried to get them to stop all they did
[1:12:38] is just went underground and created
[1:12:40] their own deal still exists today that
[1:12:42] Spirit took root and still exists today
[1:12:45] where people are willing to accept the
[1:12:47] exaltation of other men and women and
[1:12:50] they feel good about that I'm telling
[1:12:52] you my brother and sister there is a
[1:12:54] point that you can say thank you for the
[1:12:56] compliment but it's nothing but God it's
[1:12:59] not us it's not you it's Christ in you
[1:13:02] the hope of glory that's the only thing
[1:13:04] that we can accomplish is opening the
[1:13:06] door and letting Christ in that he
[1:13:09] becomes the preeminent part of our life
[1:13:11] and when he becomes that preeminent part
[1:13:13] we'll stand and see great things amen
[1:13:16] we'll see the power of God answered
[1:13:18] prayer mothers amen Housewives amen why
[1:13:22] the prophet of God said your prayer is
[1:13:24] just as effective Ive as his prayer was
[1:13:27] why because it's the same God it's not a
[1:13:30] god of yesterday and we're not looking
[1:13:32] at a God that's going to appear in the
[1:13:33] future we're talking about the very God
[1:13:36] that stood on the platform when a
[1:13:38] prophet was in a prayer line and he said
[1:13:40] he is here my brother and sister you can
[1:13:42] stand in your kitchen and make the same
[1:13:45] declaration he is here and I believe in
[1:13:49] and my prayer is sincere and my motive
[1:13:51] is correct he will answer that prayer
[1:13:54] and we can stand with confidence on the
[1:13:56] word amen that's right that's right
[1:13:59] because the idea that some have that we
[1:14:01] would have to go back to a prophet don't
[1:14:03] misunderstand me we got to go back to a
[1:14:06] profet to get this my brother and sister
[1:14:08] if brother brandom appeared on the Earth
[1:14:10] today they would hand you a number like
[1:14:12] you do when you go to the hardware store
[1:14:14] and it would have a million something
[1:14:17] will be your
[1:14:20] turn but when you have a need does
[1:14:23] anyone have a need today when you have a
[1:14:26] need you don't need to draw a number
[1:14:28] you've got a direct line to the throne
[1:14:31] room you can stand up and say my God
[1:14:34] Amen They Crucified him but he rose and
[1:14:38] he's living again and he's living in me
[1:14:41] Hallelujah I have a direct line to that
[1:14:43] throne room and I can stand here right
[1:14:46] now and say Lord I have need I got a
[1:14:49] sick child I got a strain in my
[1:14:51] relationship in my family in whatever it
[1:14:54] is oh Lord I need
[1:14:57] help and he's right on this
[1:15:00] scene
[1:15:02] hallelujah amen
[1:15:05] amen
[1:15:07] yeah isn't it amazing how God
[1:15:10] came he came as revealed word amen
[1:15:13] that's it that's so
[1:15:15] anti-climax some people can't hardly
[1:15:17] just deal with that
[1:15:20] amen people will tell you oh no for the
[1:15:24] bride to get
[1:15:25] raptured we need something special to
[1:15:29] happen and that is we need a Revival in
[1:15:32] the church we need a repentance and we
[1:15:33] need a Revival there's our something
[1:15:36] special we need to get back to the word
[1:15:38] we need to get back to A Life That's
[1:15:40] consecrated and devoted and we place God
[1:15:42] in the first and the foremost they'll be
[1:15:44] our something my brother and
[1:15:49] sister you see he came as a revealed
[1:15:51] word and people just Overlook that no
[1:15:53] our church says
[1:15:55] oh you think that's only my brother and
[1:15:57] sister sorry to speak almost sounds
[1:15:59] rough you think that's just out there in
[1:16:00] the denomination our church says no sir
[1:16:03] no sir it's right amongst people that
[1:16:05] believe the very things you believe amen
[1:16:08] well I say the very things to a point
[1:16:10] they believe the same amen that's
[1:16:13] right let me tell you how technical
[1:16:15] people can be sometimes I hope you see
[1:16:17] humor in this I was talking to a man
[1:16:19] about the message one time and I
[1:16:21] saidwell it's as simple as the fact that
[1:16:22] a page has two sides
[1:16:25] and he said well you're
[1:16:27] wrong the page has this side and that
[1:16:31] side and this side and that side and
[1:16:33] this side and that
[1:16:35] side okay fine fine write me a note on
[1:16:41] this
[1:16:44] side write a love letter on that
[1:16:48] side no sir what will you do you'll take
[1:16:51] this side or this side that's right sir
[1:16:54] because these sides if I could put this
[1:16:56] to you are the
[1:16:59] Supernatural and it takes God to reveal
[1:17:02] to us what's on this side this side this
[1:17:04] side and this side any man can write on
[1:17:07] the front and the back it takes God to
[1:17:10] write in the margins are you with me
[1:17:12] takes God to write in the margins of our
[1:17:15] heart and soul no man can write in there
[1:17:17] it takes God to write that in there and
[1:17:20] you won't even be able to really
[1:17:22] understand why you believe what you
[1:17:23] believe and how you feel and why that is
[1:17:26] such so important to you because God
[1:17:27] wrote it in the margins of your life he
[1:17:30] wrote it in the edge that's too small
[1:17:32] for you and I to even comprehend it but
[1:17:34] it's still written amen amen
[1:17:38] amen so where did God reveal this
[1:17:40] message to
[1:17:45] us did he reveal it up here no sir he
[1:17:49] revealed it
[1:17:51] here did he reveal it
[1:17:53] here
[1:17:56] he revealed it right
[1:17:58] here why don't we go back to that point
[1:18:00] to find our
[1:18:02] answer why don't we have enough
[1:18:04] confidence in here to stand as Paul did
[1:18:07] before King agria and preach the word to
[1:18:10] him preach the life to him we don't need
[1:18:12] to have well if this will happen and
[1:18:14] that will happen amen Paul did not tell
[1:18:16] Agrippa that he's risen
[1:18:20] if he'll change your life
[1:18:23] if he preached the word amen he preached
[1:18:26] a living God Amen a Living Word a living
[1:18:29] message a living life is what he
[1:18:31] preached and King Agrippa caught the
[1:18:34] Revelation that there's something Beyond
[1:18:36] this life and I'm almost convinced to
[1:18:38] commit myself to it but I can't quite
[1:18:41] but I'll tell you what my brother and
[1:18:42] sister the Apostle Paul as we sit here
[1:18:45] today you might say we're uh uh converts
[1:18:48] of the Apostle Paul's
[1:18:50] Ministry yes sir are you with me yes sir
[1:18:53] yeah cuz brother brandham said hey what
[1:18:56] about
[1:18:58] Paul yeah Paul will have to stand with
[1:19:00] his people
[1:19:03] amen I
[1:19:05] preached what Paul preached yes
[1:19:09] sir Paul had a much more Supernatural
[1:19:12] Ministry than I think we give credit
[1:19:14] yeah in the day that we
[1:19:23] live I'll just skip over a couple of
[1:19:25] these things
[1:19:26] here
[1:19:28] amen now Mark
[1:19:34] 11 we'll look here my brother and sister
[1:19:36] and I've shortened this script scripture
[1:19:39] up it it's it's much broader I hope you
[1:19:42] don't mind but you can go read the whole
[1:19:45] context and Jesus answering saith unto
[1:19:48] them have faith in God for verily I say
[1:19:53] unto you that whoever shall say unto to
[1:19:54] this mountain be thou removed
[1:19:59] amen when the last time you moved a
[1:20:09] mountain come on most of you don't even
[1:20:11] have dirt underneath your
[1:20:14] fingernails so is he talking
[1:20:18] carnal or spiritual amen now I want to
[1:20:21] ask you when's the last time you moved
[1:20:23] to Mountain
[1:20:25] amen I hope you lift a hand and say it's
[1:20:28] been recent amen I asked the Lord and
[1:20:31] that mountain that situation that thing
[1:20:33] that was so big in my life I woke up in
[1:20:36] the morning it was gone anxiety and fear
[1:20:40] and depression and all of these spirits
[1:20:42] and all of these thoughts that were
[1:20:44] tormenting my life and I said Lord I
[1:20:46] need your help and the word said when
[1:20:49] you cry out his name he draws nigh to
[1:20:51] you and you fell asleep because your
[1:20:54] flesh and it was there in the middle of
[1:20:56] the night your faith is out there with a
[1:20:58] shovel move in the mountain and you wake
[1:21:01] up in the morning and say thank you Lord
[1:21:03] I've been delivered from this depression
[1:21:05] this fear this anxiety I've been
[1:21:07] delivered from these
[1:21:09] doubts you didn't move the mountain it
[1:21:12] was your faith that moved the mountain
[1:21:15] amen it was there the word working over
[1:21:18] time on your behalf but you had to
[1:21:20] believe it you had to make claim for it
[1:21:23] and I'm going to ask you right now you
[1:21:24] got a mountain in your life right now
[1:21:27] amen lift a hand lift a heart say Lord
[1:21:29] please move the mountain I need you to
[1:21:32] move Lord I got children that don't have
[1:21:34] the Holy Ghost I got children not
[1:21:36] serving God I've got family here I've
[1:21:38] got health issue I got whatever it is
[1:21:41] amen have faith in God move that
[1:21:44] mountain it's no longer for us to sit
[1:21:46] back and say God will do it someday amen
[1:21:50] God's called us to do it today he's
[1:21:52] called us to have faith enough in him
[1:21:54] today my brother and
[1:21:57] sister we have so many arguments in the
[1:22:00] message over this and over that but I
[1:22:03] tell you you can't argue with this right
[1:22:06] here when Jesus saith unto them have
[1:22:09] faith in God there should be nothing to
[1:22:11] argue over there because we're not
[1:22:13] putting someone between us and
[1:22:17] God be thou removed and be thou cast
[1:22:20] into the
[1:22:22] sea and shall not doubt in his heart now
[1:22:25] I hope you don't mind me Taking
[1:22:26] Liberties but what see is this we got
[1:22:29] this idea that we're going to be sitting
[1:22:30] out here you know how far we live from
[1:22:33] the
[1:22:35] sea I think people that live in the
[1:22:37] middle of the country whatever country
[1:22:39] it might be must have more faith in the
[1:22:40] others because they're going to have to
[1:22:41] cast That Mountain a lot
[1:22:43] further no it's into the sea of God's
[1:22:47] forgetfulness it's in the sea that when
[1:22:50] you said Lord I need a Deliverance I
[1:22:52] need a revelation I need yes Lord I need
[1:22:55] your healing touch I need you to provide
[1:22:58] and that mountain is removed my brother
[1:23:00] and sister don't dwell on that mountain
[1:23:03] oh I used to be this I used to have this
[1:23:06] problem I was this and that was this and
[1:23:08] this was this forget it it's in the sea
[1:23:11] it's gone it's out of sight it's been
[1:23:14] covered that's what God wants us to do
[1:23:16] have that much faith in God maybe is a a
[1:23:19] besetting sin and you just come and say
[1:23:21] oh God forgive me I want this I need it
[1:23:24] out of my life in the name of Jesus
[1:23:26] Christ I command it to leave my life
[1:23:28] don't go back tomorrow and say I used to
[1:23:31] be an adulterer I used to be a drunk I
[1:23:33] used to lust In the Flesh I used to this
[1:23:35] I used to that quit talking about that
[1:23:37] mountain it's gone amen amen what you
[1:23:40] need to do is start lifting it up I had
[1:23:42] a prayer I had a need God came on the
[1:23:45] scene he took it out of my life and it's
[1:23:47] gone hallelujah
[1:23:50] hallelujah be a time for us to stand on
[1:23:53] the word instead of Our Own
[1:23:54] understanding that's right
[1:23:57] amen I like verse 24 don't you therefore
[1:24:01] I say unto you what so what things
[1:24:03] soever you desire amen is this a lost
[1:24:08] covet kind of Desire no sir this is a
[1:24:12] soul desire this is a heart's desire
[1:24:16] this is the word that is turning our
[1:24:18] world
[1:24:19] around
[1:24:23] amen
[1:24:26] whatsoever
[1:24:27] things whatsoever you desire When you
[1:24:30] pray believe that you receive them and
[1:24:33] ye shall have them
[1:24:36] amen is it all right I'm trying to cure
[1:24:39] this getting too personal with the
[1:24:43] congregation how many of you ever have a
[1:24:46] time that you're
[1:24:49] praying you get down and pray you got
[1:24:51] something serious to pray
[1:24:53] about
[1:24:55] and you remember you left the keys in
[1:24:57] the
[1:24:58] car and you remember that you got to pay
[1:25:01] a bill that you forgot to pay for two
[1:25:02] weeks now it has to be paid in the
[1:25:05] morning and oh by the way that online
[1:25:09] sale ends at
[1:25:18] midnight am I close to home yes
[1:25:23] sir
[1:25:28] now this is the hard
[1:25:31] part how many of you got up from prayer
[1:25:34] that's it and took care of those things
[1:25:37] that's
[1:25:40] it am I too
[1:25:46] rough you see what Satan's trying to do
[1:25:49] is get us come to a place when we did
[1:25:53] get down to
[1:25:55] pray we almost take a pencil and a pad
[1:25:57] with us to write down the things we
[1:26:02] remember come on that's
[1:26:05] it right but what does this word say
[1:26:09] he's talking to you the believer he's
[1:26:11] talking to the bride of Christ he's
[1:26:12] talking to a people that he redeemed
[1:26:15] from the ages amen and he says I saying
[1:26:18] to you what things soever you desire
[1:26:20] he's talking to the spiritual man amen
[1:26:23] When you pray believe believe that you
[1:26:25] receive them and ye shall have them
[1:26:27] that's why the word says if your heart
[1:26:30] condemns you not you get down to pray
[1:26:32] I'll ask you oh my this will be
[1:26:36] juicy how many of you when you get down
[1:26:38] to pray suddenly remember the misguided
[1:26:42] words The Temper
[1:26:46] Tantrum is there somebody in here that's
[1:26:48] like me yes sir amen yeah yes sir thank
[1:26:52] you there's at least two
[1:26:56] amen look my brother and sister you see
[1:26:59] how much Satan hates this position amen
[1:27:03] how much he hates us coming to the place
[1:27:06] that when we get down to pray that we
[1:27:08] believe we will receive them or we're
[1:27:11] believing that what we didn't repent
[1:27:13] from is going to hinder that from us and
[1:27:16] we readily accept that I'm not worthy to
[1:27:18] have this prayer
[1:27:23] answered
[1:27:24] can I answer for all of you ouch yeah
[1:27:30] forgive us Lord that's right and that
[1:27:33] would be sufficient in sincerity yes sir
[1:27:36] amen CU you see Satan knows if he can
[1:27:39] keep you and I from this position that's
[1:27:42] it with liberty in our hearts keep us
[1:27:45] from entering in knowing are you with me
[1:27:48] today knowing god is going to answer
[1:27:51] this prayer amen now look the prophet of
[1:27:55] God talks about exaltation in different
[1:27:57] places likeoh we did this but I'm not
[1:27:59] trying to exalt myself my brother and
[1:28:01] sister I'll tell you I stand in that
[1:28:03] same position today how many times in
[1:28:06] different places of this Earth this
[1:28:08] world that we have encountered people of
[1:28:11] dire need dire circumstance young people
[1:28:14] on the verge of suicide and all kinds of
[1:28:17] perversions and it's there with a prayer
[1:28:20] of faith and I'm standing there I'm the
[1:28:22] one that is speaking and I know in my
[1:28:25] heart that I cannot do a single thing
[1:28:28] but I believe amen I believe God wanted
[1:28:32] them delivered I believe God's got an
[1:28:34] answer for them I believe there's power
[1:28:36] in this word it is not an exaltation of
[1:28:39] the man himself but it is a confidence
[1:28:42] knowing that whatever we ask in his name
[1:28:45] he's going to do
[1:28:47] it imagine how powerful we'll be as a
[1:28:49] church when we get to the place that we
[1:28:51] have that kind of confidence not Mis
[1:28:54] guided confidence but real confidence in
[1:28:57] God's word that's right I'm going to ask
[1:28:59] he's going to answer that's right
[1:29:02] amen
[1:29:04] hallelujah but we go down I want to
[1:29:06] hurry through
[1:29:09] this believe and you'll receive
[1:29:12] them when you stand
[1:29:15] praying forgive yes sir amen that's
[1:29:19] another beautiful tool the devil's got
[1:29:21] amen
[1:29:23] well they deserve that I'm angry with
[1:29:27] them they deserve
[1:29:29] this they deserve me to be rude they
[1:29:34] deserve no what they deserve is for you
[1:29:37] to forgive them that's right exactly
[1:29:39] that's what they deserve because when
[1:29:41] you forgive them amen it releases you am
[1:29:45] to receive this that's exactly right
[1:29:50] amen CU I don't know about you I ask the
[1:29:52] young people it's kind of entertaining

[1:32:33] situation I I I challenge you search it
[1:32:36] out in scripture I'm not going to look
[1:32:37] it up for you if you care enough you can
[1:32:39] find it amen amen because you see what
[1:32:42] happens is is whether right or wrong if

[1:32:47] you have the right answer that's right
[1:32:51] yeah right yeah
[1:32:54] reminds me of a teacher high school she
[1:32:57] handed out a test somehow or another she
[1:33:00] knew that kids had got answers to this
[1:33:02] test maybe from a previous class she
[1:33:05] passed out a test all these kids with
[1:33:07] their cheat sheets and they whip all the
[1:33:08] way through the test and every answer is
[1:33:11] right and uh you know just looks like
[1:33:14] the whole class is acing
[1:33:17] it and one kid in the back of the class
[1:33:20] he can't deal with it he's like teacher
[1:33:26] we all
[1:33:28] cheated she saysi know
[1:33:31] that but that was just a test to warm
[1:33:34] you
[1:33:35] up here's the real
[1:33:38] test who have you
[1:33:43] lied only one kid in the class raised
[1:33:46] their hand and she says okay class is
[1:33:48] dismissed and they're like what about
[1:33:50] the test that was
[1:33:52] it
[1:33:54] I
[1:34:00] flumed so sometimes the test is not what
[1:34:02] we think the test is that's right and
[1:34:05] God dealing with you and I'll just put
[1:34:07] it to you this way if you can come
[1:34:10] humble enough before God that it doesn't
[1:34:13] matter who's right and who is wrong but
[1:34:16] you want relationship that's right then
[1:34:18] you will initiate
[1:34:21] reconciliation amen are you with me amen
[1:34:27] amen okay I can't help but give you a
[1:34:30] little bit of a
[1:34:33] hint they're crucifying Jesus did Jesus
[1:34:37] ever do anything to hurt
[1:34:40] them they're crucifying Jesus did Jesus
[1:34:43] ever lie to
[1:34:44] them they're crucifying Jesus did he
[1:34:48] ever inflict personal pain upon
[1:34:51] them can anybody tell me the words that
[1:34:54] he
[1:34:56] spoke
[1:34:57] father forgive
[1:35:01] them he was perfectly right was he not
[1:35:04] amen he was perfectly correct but he was
[1:35:07] also in Perfect Harmony that's right
[1:35:09] with the word of God
[1:35:11] Amen I couldn't help myself just to
[1:35:13] share that
[1:35:22] amen
[1:35:24] is God a historical
[1:35:28] God you know how I can be so
[1:35:32] contrarian our God is a historical
[1:35:36] God because I can look back through my
[1:35:38] Bible and I can see all kinds of History
[1:35:41] concerning my God Amen but the word says
[1:35:45] he's the same yesterday that's history
[1:35:48] today which even two seconds ago is now
[1:35:51] history that's right amen
[1:35:54] and tomorrow what did the prophet say
[1:35:57] about that so many are looking back at a
[1:35:59] historical God and many are looking
[1:36:01] forward to what he will do but I want to
[1:36:04] know right now Saints I say this in a
[1:36:07] sense that I just want to stir your
[1:36:09] thoughts what is your relationship right

[1:36:20] sister what is it right now the same
[1:36:23] yesterday today and forever that's our
[1:36:27] God he's right here right now I serve a
[1:36:29] historical God and I serve a god of the
[1:36:32] future but I serve a God that's living
[1:36:35] here right now a God that answers
[1:36:37] prayers in real time amen not in past
[1:36:41] time and not in future time but in real
[1:36:44] time right now A Prayer answering God
[1:36:48] Amen Hallelujah are we looking forward
[1:36:51] yes I'm looking forward the raptures in
[1:36:53] the future future I'm looking forward
[1:36:55] amen and how is it do I know that I have
[1:37:00] Redemption I look back and I see my Lord
[1:37:04] offering himself freely on a cross amen
[1:37:07] for me
[1:37:09] freely they said oh no no it was under
[1:37:12] duress they forced him to do that no my
[1:37:14] brother and sister imagine God our
[1:37:17] awesome God and the snap of a finger if
[1:37:20] he would have said Lord take these
[1:37:22] Legions from me
[1:37:24] I don't know if that armor would have
[1:37:26] stood up or fell down or what but they
[1:37:28] would have been done they're
[1:37:30] gone but he willingly walked up there to
[1:37:35] put us in a sense that we can look and
[1:37:38] see what it
[1:37:41] is amen oh that a friend would lay down
[1:37:44] his life amen he's our friend is he not

[1:38:07] this is way too personal today I'm so
[1:38:09] sorry Saints but any of you ever just
[1:38:12] offered up an answer that really would
[1:38:13] qualify as a snide
[1:38:16] remark probably not a single one of you
[1:38:19] but people like you do that you know
[1:38:21] people that resemble
[1:38:23] very
[1:38:25] closely but here Paul's speaking to the
[1:38:28] Romans some of the most crft and hard
[1:38:30] people of the New Testament a a rough
[1:38:34] crowd and he says I'm persuaded of you
[1:38:36] my brethren that you're also full of
[1:38:38] goodness and filled with all knowledge
[1:38:41] able also demonish one
[1:38:44] another that word demonish my brother
[1:38:46] and sister is quite interesting cuz some
[1:38:48] believes that's we have a stick to beat
[1:38:50] people with but admonished would include
[1:38:53] also the words encourag amen so we are a
[1:38:56] people that should be able to encourage
[1:38:58] one another we should be able if you see
[1:39:00] fault in brother Paul amen you should
[1:39:04] come and talk to me but if not you
[1:39:06] should pray for me amen you should and
[1:39:09] this is what the word wants us to do
[1:39:11] this is how we bring Harmony in the body
[1:39:13] this is how the body becomes one that we
[1:39:15] look at one another and realize you know
[1:39:17] what I'm persuaded of this I am not
[1:39:20] caught in confusion I am not bewildered
[1:39:23] amen I am not bewildered Hallelujah can
[1:39:26] I just read this super long quote to
[1:39:30] you amen I'm
[1:39:33] sorry I I should be more thorough more
[1:39:37] organized but
[1:39:40] um it's the greatest news flash in
[1:39:44] history just greatest news
[1:39:47] flash you know years
[1:39:52] ago I became interested I don't think we
[1:39:54] even kept them
[1:39:56] but we had newspapers from South
[1:40:01] Africa
[1:40:02] concerning Nelson Mandela we had
[1:40:05] newspapers from you know the Twin Towers
[1:40:09] we had newspapers from all these
[1:40:11] different things that happen in the
[1:40:13] world real newspapers not souvenir
[1:40:14] newspapers real
[1:40:16] newspapers and you know you look at
[1:40:18] those and almost every one of them
[1:40:20] presented itself as a news flash this
[1:40:23] latest breaking greatest thing that ever
[1:40:26] happened right here and we're the first
[1:40:27] one to give it to you says
[1:40:29] everyone but here the prophet names a
[1:40:33] whole sermon the greatest news flash in
[1:40:37] history I think this is legitimate I
[1:40:40] think this is real he said oh what a
[1:40:43] glorious thing it is for his church
[1:40:44] after 1900 years almost 2,000 years ago
[1:40:48] to know that he
[1:40:50] lives we meet him in church on Sunday
[1:40:59] mornings no he says we meet him in every
[1:41:05] Bend of the road
[1:41:08] amen at every
[1:41:10] turn and every place we go we see
[1:41:15] Jesus see his living presence flowing
[1:41:18] like a radiant light from his glorious
[1:41:20] Church of the Living God
[1:41:23] did you guys catch the
[1:41:26] shift he took it from just being a light
[1:41:30] to a light that's in a glorious Church
[1:41:32] to be seen of the
[1:41:35] world you realize man I when I was a kid
[1:41:40] had a teacher that said Paul you love to
[1:41:41] talk you should be in drama
[1:41:44] class I ended up taking speech class
[1:41:47] instead which turned out to be much
[1:41:48] better you know cuz um I was well anyway
[1:41:56] if you guys think you don't have words
[1:41:57] I've heard some of you saywell we just
[1:41:58] don't have words to say that it's cuz I
[1:42:00] got
[1:42:01] them reason you don't have words is cuz
[1:42:03] I got
[1:42:05] them but look at this you
[1:42:09] see we see Jesus living presence flowing
[1:42:12] like radiant light from his glorious
[1:42:14] Church of the Living God how thankful we
[1:42:16] should be for that the message was given
[1:42:19] at the
[1:42:22] tomb are you with me am I being too
[1:42:25] personic if I focus down too tight the
[1:42:28] message was given at the
[1:42:34] tomb well we don't believe that the
[1:42:36] message really becomes applicable until
[1:42:38] the seals were open in 1963 everything
[1:42:42] before that
[1:42:45] was baby
[1:42:47] chatter no no come on
[1:42:51] nonsense nonsense my brother and sister
[1:42:53] people got this point that oh it starts
[1:42:55] here it starts there it stops there this
[1:42:57] applies that doesn't apply no the
[1:42:59] prophet of God said the message started
[1:43:01] was given at the Tomb come see go tell
[1:43:05] first thing come and be convinced
[1:43:07] nowadays people don't want to come uh to
[1:43:10] see those who do come can't set 10
[1:43:13] minutes 5 minutes sometimes if you cross

[1:43:44] and God dealt with him and when he come
[1:43:46] back amen he had something to share and

[1:48:03] many of them had returned back to their
[1:48:05] fish nets they wanted to go back to
[1:48:07] catching fishes they were bewildered
[1:48:09] because they didn't know what or how to
[1:48:11] make in Meet they had absolutely trusted
[1:48:14] that he was the Messiah and here he was
[1:48:17] dead see that's the problem so many

[1:49:14] Mark 16 was written in the Bible they're
[1:49:16] so bewildered they say it wasn't
[1:49:18] inspired and they find other scriptures
[1:49:20] and say the Holy Spirit was applied to
[1:49:22] another another day and not this day
[1:49:24] they find other scriptures where
[1:49:26] Miracles was to be done and they claim
[1:49:28] that all the days of Miracles is
[1:49:32] p they got more faith this is not quote
[1:49:34] here they got more faith in receiving
[1:49:37] their direct deposit
[1:49:39] paycheck than they have in the word of

[1:49:55] Hocus
[1:49:56] Pocus I'm no I'm telling you the truth
[1:49:59] it's Hocus Pocus there's a case of a man
[1:50:02] who deposited a

[1:50:06] bank you know they put in the little
[1:50:08] thing and it goes
[1:50:09] who and it prints on the thing and they
[1:50:12] take it and put it to the side no one
[1:50:14] could find the check and the money never
[1:50:17] appeared in his account the only way he
[1:50:20] was able to prove that was the go back
[1:50:23] to the people who wrote the check have
[1:50:25] them go to their bank and those people
[1:50:27] didn't trust the bank enough that they
[1:50:29] got all of their checks back I want to
[1:50:30] ask you how many of you get your checks
[1:50:33] back you have faith in your
[1:50:36] bank and if you have that much faith in
[1:50:38] your bank to make sure that your check
