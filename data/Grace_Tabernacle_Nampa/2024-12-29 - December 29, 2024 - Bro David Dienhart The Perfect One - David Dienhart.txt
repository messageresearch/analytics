present this morning the king of kings amen the Lord of lords is here amen I wonder if you've come expecting from him this morning have you come expecting or have you come to find fault be critical judgmental or have you expected to meet him yes amen have you expected to meet him amen then God will give you what you expect you'll always find something to be critical of if you come expecting that you'll find it amen but I say let's bind that Spirit from having any preeminence or being able to even unfold itself here to hinder the word of God Amen how many will agree with me amen then it's bound just two or three agrees is touching any one thing amen then we're expecting him to speak we're expecting him to bless his word and you're come expecting him to reveal his word he'll reveal it to you you'll walk out of here a changed person you be closer to him lift it up yes amen that's exactly right I'm expecting to receive what comes out of my mouth this morning amen praise the Lord amen I believe God's in control of us I believe he's fully capable he I walked out here he knew I'd walk out here he predestined I'd walk out here and you'd be seated where you're seated and he brought you into this life why can't we rest in him and ask him to come in and take predominance he created you created the very seat you're sitting on the very clothes you wear everything has been created by Him that's right then can't we take him at his word he created it by his word amen praise the Lord am I thank God that we can pledge allegiance to the Lord yes not just halfheartedly not by just an expression of word but because we in our hearts and soul believe all of our hearts we love him I want to serve him and fulfill my purpose you want to fulfill your purpose he called you to his eternal purpose while you're here in this decreed season to manifest him let's bow our heads for in prayer our heavenly father we have come with expectation I'm expecting you to speak I'm expecting you to bless your word I'm expecting you to take these lips of clay and speak thoughts that David knows nothing about it's not David Lord It's that predestinated word that's come alive in my soul and in the hearts of these people Lord meet their expectations manifest yourself those that sick may they be well may they be healed needing salvation save those that are savable here this morning Lord through Thy word and Lord open the word reveal it to our hearts as we're expecting our expectation is from you you are Our Shepherd we shall not want you said you'd make us to lie down in Green Pastures you'd lead us beside Still Waters may it be Green Pastures this morning in Still Waters Lord I pray and though we live in this body of clay this pest house this this man out here it's not that is not what we're judging our life by we are redeemed we are bought you have unveiled yourself in us thank you Lord Our Shepherd is leading we thank you for this now and asking these things in the name of Jesus Christ and for your glory amen amen praise the Lord I'd like you to be seated for a few moments and we'll read some scripture here as the Lord leads I don't know this computer on I don't it's I don't know what even what time it is so I guess I don't have to pay attention to time so good cuz I don't even see it here or maybe God blinding my eyes from seeing it I don't know but I don't see it amen I want to I want to title this this morning the perfect one that's just not a cliche that's a that's a definite manifestation I'm getting a rebound here yeah okay cut it back a little amen the perfect the perfect one there is one perfect that's right anybody know him yes he said I'll not only be with you he said I'll be in you so we're speaking about the perfect one Not Perfect Two the perfect one amen all right now this one I'm speaking of will could say the he's the birth word the new man the real gift the new creation God's race the perfect one in the message Christ The Mystery of God revealed if you haven't read that that message my goodness start consuming it feed it on it because it's it's packed it's the manifestation it's the revelation of the seven seal yes amen but I want to quote a quote out of paragraph 290 now listen carefully to this I'm still getting a little bit of rebound here so okay you can hear me fine I know you can hear me okay so something like it loud coming back at him and I really don't like it loud or I can hear myself Beyond in you know and then hearing that whistle coming back or that high pitch anyway let's continue on this is this is what he's saying brother Brown speaking here it's Jesus Christ the new birth revealed in you amen I want to say this again notice this I'll read it again it's Jesus Christ the new birth reveal in you that he has the pinenes that he might Express his words and anything that he's promised in the last days he can bring it to pass through his body for you yes his body as he's working amen he brings it to pass through his body as he's working amen it's just exactly the word of God made manifest so let me this kind of broke up let me read this again it is Jesus Christ the new birth revealed in you I'm talking about the perfect one that's right it's Jesus Christ the new birth and you and I must be born again that's right yes who is this new birth it's Jesus Christ so where is he it's Jesus Christ unveiled amen how many know in our day we've had the complete unveiling of God Amen we had that message ministered to us the unveiling of God Amen it's Jesus Christ the new birth revealed in you that he has the pinenes the over preeminence means the oversight he's the head that he might Express his words his words amen what are those words words of Faith yes all right that he might Express his words and anything that he's promised in the last days he can bring it to pass through his body as he's working who's working amen as he's working amen it's just exactly the word of God made manifest what is it it's exactly the word of God made manifest yeah now in pick up your pen and write he said he did not complete all his work while in his Earthly Ministry so now he works in and through the bride yes right now he works in and and through the bride she knows that she knows that for it was not yet time for him to do certain things that he must now do but he will now fulfill through the bride that work remember through his body as he's working that work which is left for this specific time so where who is he working in and through where is he he's in his bride who's she she's him all right now so for this specific time if the church has has been judged and they have judged themselves and have accepted the blood how can God judge a man that's perfectly totally sinless right amen how can God judge a man that's perfectly totally sinless we're speaking of this perfect one we're speaking of the new birth we're speaking of that which is growing in you to maturity amen it's him yes and I'm I'm very easily wanting to get ahead of myself and I got to bring myself back here so you listen carefully I know you are and we'll read we'll read some scriptures here in just a minute and refer to many scriptures but he's work he will now fulfill through the bride the work he's left for this specific time he will he will not you will he I'm talking about you I'm talking about the man not you will he will but he's going to work it through you yes amen isn't that what Romans 10811 said that he would Quicken your mortal body and the prophet said rising of the Sun that he would bring your body subject to his word amen what is the evidence of the Holy Ghost then his working by the word through the word in you yes why is that because you had an ear to hear the word yeah amen amen all right now so getting back to this he said how can God judge a man that's perfectly totally sinless you say there's no such a person it depends on which side of the skin you're looking at there is no such a person that is David's not perfect the man the The Vessel you live in this flesh man is actually just a pest house yeah that's not perfect amen is that right there's only one perfect that's the Holy Ghost the word revealed in you amen amen that'll always come back to and do the works of the word in the place and in the and in the position you've been called to work it and that takes faith and that's his faith amen amen because the believer is the faith of God the faith of god is perfect faith brother brandom called it Eternal Faith amen amen so the believer is we're talking about not just a believer that says the believer but the believer the real believer is the faith of God Amen that's moving in you am amen now who you want to trust you're born again who you want to trust Jesus Christ the new birth yes or your faults and failures and your mistakes and how you feel and how you look by with These Eyes you can't judge things by how you look in these eyes you judge things by how what you look at through the word amen all right so now he said there's no every born-again believer every True Believer is perfectly absolutely sinless before God he's not trusting in his Works he's trusting in the blood of Jesus that his confessions dropped into amen now in that blood is life The Germ the blood The Germ you're born by you are born by the blood of God right cuz the germ holds the blood I mean the blood holds the germ and that's the life amen so you're born by the blood if the life comes through that blood what's it going to produce Jesus Christ the same yesterday and today and forever that's the new birth all right now the Bible says so see he that is born of God does not commit sin amen see he that's born of God does not commit sin for he cannot sin let's say that again he that's born of God what is who is he that's born of God what are you that you're born of God who are you him amen it's revealed in you now you talk about the real you like Brother Paul's been saying who are you the real you if you realize who you really are yeah I've just read it to you here it's Jesus Christ the new birth yes amen amen now how's that how's that how's he going to make himself known what's the identification of that by hearing and receiving the word for your season by genuine Revelation amen you can't manufacture Revelation you can't get Revelation you can't pump yourself up to Revelation it's sovereignly given to you by God amen righten amen you can't produce it right you can't make it happen that's right it's given by the hearing of the word and he gives it to you and that is the evidence that you're his son you're his seed there's no other evidence you have the ability to hear the word for the hour the season with a genuine revelation of what that word is speaking because how's it going to be identified in the word it's just not say I have Revel and then there's no manifestation there's nothing to bring it back into the word it's going to be manifest going to be confirmed by the word amen amen all right now let's turn over here to to St John 3 so why can't why can't the the he that's born of God commits sin because the seed of God remains in him here here's the reason why the seed of God remains in him he is born of God the rain remember the rain falls on both just and unjust the same anointing of the Holy Spirit when it falls upon his own seed will Quicken that seed and that seed must produce what it is it must bring forth what it is it'll produce of its own kind that's right that's how you know yes that's right yeah amen all right so it the seed of God remains in him he's born of God and and other words the rain is falling on his seed word quickened it's birthed yeah amen all right and now what's happening and I'll get to this a little bit later as we go into the message we're laying now in the presence of the sun what's happening we're ripening yes Amen to what maturity adoption yes amen full placing amen right through the body change amen all right John St John 3:6 Jesus said that which is born let's back up to verse 5 verily verily I say you except a man be born of water and of the spirit he cannot enter into the kingdom of God another place he said you cannot see cannot see the kingdom of God amen hey he does says that in verse three except a man be born again he cannot see the kingdom of God verse six that which is born of the flesh is flesh that's right I'm going to bring a separation here amen CU he brought the separation Jesus himself brought the separation here that's exactly right he that's born of the flesh is flesh there's every one of us in here have been born of the flesh natural birth is a flesh birth are you with me it's a okay you're there's nobody in here that's not born of the flesh that's right but when that open when that word inside of you becomes open that seed that elect seed then you say as the prophet said that little spot of ET of life in communion message communion 1965 that little spot of eternal life is who I am I'm therefore no longer the son of Charles and AB branam are you with me you you've raised to a higher position you realize now who you really are cuz all you knew when you were born you were born in sin shape and iniquity come in the world speaking lies your righteousness is filthy rags there's none good no not one right so he that's born of the flesh is flesh but he which is born of the spirit capital s look at your Bible he which is born of the spirit is Spirit or little God yeah not another himself amen so he that's born of the flesh is flesh he that's born of the spirit is spirit all right now now let's go over here go to First Corinthians now remember now remember that Jesus also said in and you don't have to turn to it but in Matthew 5:48 that be ye perfect therefore for perfect as your father which is in heaven is perfect and brother bam said there's no way that you as a man and I as a man humanly can do that we can't make oursel perfect because we're imperfect but there is a perfect one and that comes through the blood that's the germ life in that blood that is laid that is brought forth from the blood quickens that Believer by a true baptism is that right the water went out the rain went out it went for the farmer that plant the seed of course we know there was another one come behind him planting yeah another seed right but right now we're talking about the original planter yeah that planted his seed right the one that went first all right and he planted a seed and the rain came and it quickened that seed and if he planted wheat it will be wheat if that one behind him planted wild wheat it will be wild wheat so close it would deceive the elect if possible right is that right it's that close why because they're both Anointed with the genuine Holy Ghost but one the Holy Ghost is anointing the word and the other one it's an anointing another seed yeah yet both anointed in their Spirit their second realm of their Spirit to do signs and wonders shout everything and we all believe in that I'm shouting pretty loud right now I believe in shouting I believe in in those gifts I believe in all of that but that can be impersonated yes right but this word this open Word of the third pole cannot be impersonated because it's a person and he Satan can't be that person Hallelujah am isn't that right all right so so it's another person and we're not talking about this person I'm talking about a person the word eternal life is a person that's right amen amen hallelujah I can't hardly wait I want to get ahead of myself so bad I just got to hold back a little bit maybe I'll have to hurry up and get ahead of myself to make it done in time but listen now so he said in 1 Corinthians 15 and we'll read verse 45 just said he that's born of spirit is spirit let me also bring you back to another scripture while you while you've turned to that place but in 1 Corinthians 6:17 it said he that's joined to the Lord that's a union are you with me that's a union yeah the Bible said we'll come to a minute you are his workmanship created in Christ Jesus amen so it's a union you're in Union with him he that is joined to the Lord is one Spirit and the Lord is that spirit and where the spirit of the Lord is there is Liberty Hallelujah where the SP I just love this where the spirit of the Lord is I just pointed to you where he's at he is the word moving living in you revealed he's never changed his that's all he always has been right right amen as he's in you United himself with you and you are that one spirit let me just give you a quote on the things that are to be you the real you the you he said is the spirit of God in you yes amen then why pay attention to faults and mistakes and failures just commit them under the blood know the blood no you're under the blood because you've been identified under the blood by the revelation of Jesus Christ in you amen right and let me just jump ahead a little bit you're identified in the Rapture you're identified in the resurrection and life amen that's your identification amen hallelujah now we're just building that okay now as we go on here so in Corinthians 1 Corinthians 15:45 he said and so it is written the first man Adam was made a living Soul are you with me yes the first man Adam was made a living Soul the last Adam known as the second Adam the second the last Adam was made a quickening spirit amen I don't know why it is every time I get up to the platform to preach my nose runs but we all have peculiar ities all right let me read that again because this is very important the second the last the second Adam was made a quickening spirit yes now watch as it goes on and I just said he just said you are the spirit of God in you yes what is that spirit of God quickening Spirit what's it said to do teach you Lead You Quicken the word to you amen are you with me it's a quickening spirit do you realize that's you now watch because it goes right on and says it Watch what it says how be it that was not first which is spiritual but that which is natural and afterward that which is spiritual yeah okay now listen that doesn't take away what he did see but he but he's talking about those that man first natural then spiritual mhm First Natural then Born Again spiritual remember the Bible said it's the spiritual man first cor or or 1 Corinthians 2 the last having the mind of Christ and he that is spiritual deser all things right is that right and he that is spiritual discerne yeah all right say Oh Brother David you're just too spiritual I can't get spiritual enough when it comes to this word living that's right you want to keep pointing at this go ahead and point at this but I'd rather have I'd rather point you to this inward man yes Amen on the inside of the inside I think the message you are ought to point you there and it does point you there but saying it ought to be ministered that way it ought to be pointing you to what you aren't pointing you to what you are instead of what you aren't amen because look at he continues on to say here and so it is written the 47 the first man is of the earth earthy is there anybody here that's earthy every one of us are so Earthly we stink hello I don't say that to be I'm not talking about don't have you do alert and those kind of things I'm talking about it's pest house it's dying yes amen I mean we got a doctor room it's knows good and well we're dying like the prophet said you fill up the cup and it begins to fill up but then it comes to a point where it doesn't fill up anymore now what well how's that you've got an appointed time to die that's right we try to do everything we can to keep people living but the but you'll never live without the Holy Ghost you can die in this flesh but that's that Soul that's been quickened to life that real Gift of Life abiding in you the real you can never die believest thou this he which believeth liveth and believeth in me shall never die believe thou this amen and and and Martha was so quickened by that she took that message and ran to her sister and said Mary he calleth for you I wonder if we can't come with the same voice and call for you are we not calling this morning amen come to your place come to your position yes come to who you are come to what you are amen amen if I could ask you who's born again I'd expect people to raise their hands here I'm born again well then that's Jesus Christ that's you amen the perfect one Hallelujah I'd rather My Confession that it ought to be your confession ought to be just not words yeah but it ought to be the words of Faith yes to be a True Confession first prophet said you must believe what he said yes right that's faith we can't even serve god without faith we can't please him so it must be faith it's got to be an knowing then put it into a word it's got to happen because it's the word of faith holding fast the confession of our faith our faith isn't a church well I go to such and such a church that's not your faith your faith is that you are the church your faith is that you're the word living yourself and you're the genuine he said you're my Witnesses because you were my word to begin with and if we were his word to begin with then we were his eternal thought to begin with Hallelujah that not only Fel that's not just a feeling that really is good amen because the prophet I mean the god ordained us to be himself right yeah predestinated as he was makes the Word Flesh in us as it was in him amen that's a direct quote amen so where does that position you and I why are we walking along with poochie lip disease oh sure we're B we're battling every day we battle a a a voice that's against us and it's the voice of this flesh man yeah but you don't have to get place to that am where Brother David on the battlefield you win or lose on the battlefield but you have the greatest thing to to against the devil that ever was given to you you have the word of God the Eternal Word and you have the word of God yourself you are the word amen all right now watch he said to going on verse 47 the first man of the earth earthy watch who the second man is the Lord From Heaven amen Paul do how to bring it right down sure do to right here who's that second man first man's earthy this is me but I've been born again then the second man the inward man the Inside Man those are all words in the Bible the inward man the Inside Man the new creation the new man amen born from

are they also that are Earthly and a and as is the Heavenly such are they also that are Heavenly amen amen and and as we have borne the image of the Earthly we shall all also bear the image of the Heavenly Amen brother brandom said there was two Natures in this same body one is a Victor right and the other one will be swallowed up that's right amen think of that how's it going be what's going to be swallowed up in Victory yeah do you realize you are his victory the Lord amen why because you are him the word the word is his victory he's given it to us not as a letter but he gave it to us by the spirit and the spirit and the letter coming together is Dynamics mechanics and there is true worship and there is Jesus Christ the same yesterday and today and forever standing right here in our midst because the word has come together with the spirit has come with to the word amen amen and when those two come together he said the bride will be both Dynamic and mechanics yeah she'll be both the word and the letter that's right she'll be both the I mean excuse me the spirit and the word she'll be both of those combined together right and it'll move this this manifestation of himself down the road right into a body change amen all right so now we're in a we're we're in a pretty good position here this is the end day this is the end time it's been that's been opened To Us by the Seven Seals opening we have arrived we're at the end we don't know that specific day when I'm going to be changed but it could be yet right here today we can see walk in that door I can see my mother and father and walk in that door right I'm expecting to meet them if I'm here and remain I'm going to meet them and that tells me I'm ready I'm right here I I've seen them I'm already changing I'm I'm already already changing but I'm going to be changed you understand what I'm saying amen that's how close we are I'm expecting that every day I think of that many times out early early morning out in prayer I'm thinking that I just tap on the shoulder yes who's that walking toward me right you say Oh Brother David that that's how close it is right because I've already got that Resurrection I've already got that rapture as a person in me it's already being revealed already have the I already have the substance of it that's right amen that's right right how can you have the substance of things hoped for and the evidence of Things Not Seen and not get it you've already got it Hebrews 11:1 that's You' already got it nobody's going to talk you out of it it's a substance right not something you imagine it's not something you feel it's something that's revealed it's true it's n knowing and it's Eternal it's God's faith amen all right now so we go on here now I say this Brethren you're bearing the image of the Heavenly now I say Brethren that flesh and blood cannot inherit the kingdom of God neither does corruption inherit incorruption so don't expect to do something to Merit or warrant getting a body Changed by what you do or don't do in the humanness I believe in doing good things but that's not going to get you in there's only one thing that's going to get you is the working of the Holy Spirit In You by Revelation hallel and once it's revealed to you it's yours amen when that's quick to you and your soul it's yours and God expects you to live according to it amen that's right act accordingly do accordingly as he reveals it to his in in you Reveals His word to you amen amen glory all right now 1 Peter 1:19 very familiar but we will read it anyway First Peter 1 starting with verse 19 but but with the precious blood of Christ as with the lamb without blemish and without spot who verily was for ordained before the foundation of world but was manifest in these last days for in these last days days for you who by him do believe in God who how do we believe in God by him who by him we believe in God that raised him up from the dead and gave him glory that your faith Your Faith and Hope might be in God seeing you have purified your souls in obeying the truth through the spirit with unto unfeigned love of the brethren see that you love one another with a pure heart fervently who is love tell me it's God Amen it's not human we're not talking about this is not human love here I believe in human love feel you love yes but this agape love right is a different love one is one that's God himself the other is human amen all right but if that human love isn't governed by The Godly love it's going to go wire that's right all right it's got to be based there got to be something there there's got to be the love of God in you yeah amen and you know you're in love with him for you have received his spirit and he's identified that in you by giving you himself amen amen shows you love the Brethren yeah everybody wants to judge that by your work judge that by your works it's just judge it by the word I can sound very unlovable you can too but that does does that mean you have no love no good question Brother David who you judging it by there you are I'll tell you there's men in the Bible didn't sound like they were in love with anything that were of God yeah Jesus himself looked upon them with Angry Eyes and beat them out with whips out of the sanctuary out of the out of the it was brother Brandon said why brother why brother randam that wasn't even that was in the what do they call that next connected to the church this wasn't wasn't in the temple it was in the I forget how he said it but he went in there and beat him out and said my father's house a house of prayer and you made it a a den of Thieves amen see and what what motivated him to do that the word what's the word do loves the truth yeah what's love do I mean loves the truth amen are you with me all right so let's get off of that we've got but that still bases what I want to in bringing here all right now but watch what he for the for being born again this is on verse 23 being born again not of corruptible seed but of Incorruptible by the word of God which liveth and abideth forever yeah see people can be under that rain and shout and and Shout the roof off have signs and wonders do good works and still be a devil yeah Judas cast out Devils you tell me how he did it yeah he did it because Jesus said I give you power to do it and he believed it amen you say he believed it yeah he believed it but he didn't have God's faith to believe it he had his own intellectual Faith but it worked because he was the son of the devil and he couldn't receive the word for the season which was the outpouring of the Holy Ghost to come in them and birth the word yeah yeah he couldn't accept that could he so any so anyway let's go on here so your birth by the not by Incorruptible seed but by by by being born again not of corruptible seed but but of Incorruptible your birth by The Incorruptible seed you excuse me just a minute can I turn this off a moment I'm going to have to get rid of some is it push the button is all okay okay back on all right now so you're born again by Incorruptible seed I want you to go to Philippians 2 and we'll get into more of the meat of this as we go on here Philippians chapter 2 and let's look at one thing here he said he works in and through his bride and we'll come back to Philippians 2 in just a moment I've got something else I want to bring out to that but Philippians 2:13 for it is God which worketh in you both to Will and to do of his good pleasure amen do all things then I could put then into it but do all things without murmurings and disputings yeah that you may be blameless and harmless as sons of God without rebuke in the midst of a crooked and perverse Nation among whom you shine as lights in the world why because you because you're the a Child of Light yeah child of him yeah all right the seed of him and you you're walking in the light holding forth the Word of Life yeah that I may rejoice in the day of Christ that I'm not run in vain neither labored in vain very bre it again for it is God which worketh in you how may believe that amen yes and I think the words that we speak the things that we do ought to reflect it amen it's true you say well Brother David are you trying to make the body out word body sinless no but I'm trying to point you to the perfect one and that's who you live by because the just shall live by his faith is that right that's a revelation in you it's not a it's not an imagination well I hope I'm born again no it's a genuine evidence a substance amen and you're living by that you were asked to live by that and won't that always point to the word yes all right now here's the prophet said he said now it's seed time or bride time how many know that you see the corners turned amen yeah Leo DEA and still going on but we're not part of Leo DEA I'm talking spiritual now you are not part of leoa you've come out of leoa yes thank you in fact the call was for you to come out of it amen oh you say Brother David I'm still living and I'm still yeah but that I don't care how much these things are around you what are you giving yourself to who are you allowing to rule you've been given being the word living you have been given absolute Authority over all the power of the enemy you don't have to accept anything he has to offer you through your senses amen you can shut it off he you got to realize he has no right unless you give him that right who gives him the right the word gives him right or doesn't amen when you know it's the enemy why you giving him right right now if he just moves on in and all of a sudden you wake up and say wait a minute that was him well then go right back say Lord I didn't mean to do that he knows that he's already covered it yes amen is that right yes because we're not looking at an imperfect here we're looking at the perfect one amen we're seeing the perfect one we're seeing the Eternal one while we look not at the things which are seen but the things which are not seen for the things which are not seen are Eternal that's right the things which are seen are temporal we have one thing to do take him at his word quit adding to it or taking away from it by your opinion that the devil is giving you by reasoning he's trying to reason with you same thing he did with Eve yeah it said this but when he says but or he puts a butt to it or or or brings something else beside the pure word leave it alone amen God made a promise to you the inward man says Amen to it it's so the outer man says it's not sure it's not certainly not for you because right anybody ever heard that sure we all have right but what's God saying to you what's God saying this morning amen see look to me look away look away from that look away go on Beyond it look away you have something to go beyond you've been given the ability to do that you're my son you have the ability to speak as I had the ability to speak Faith you have the same ability to speak Faith how do you think he created the worlds by faith he gave he he himself did that gave it down to his son to say the same thing did not Jesus say did not Jesus speak it the Bible said if you abide in me and my word in you ask what you will brother BR said another place speak what you will and it shall be given shall be done unto you amen amen all right but the but the other man says brother man said then leave that outer man and take what the inward man says you've been brought to decision every day you either take up your cross deny yourself and follow him or listen to yourself listen to the man listen to what he has to say sure he's going to come I'm not telling you you're going to be free of his coming you're not trying to perfect the outer man right it's the inward man that's being perfected this outer man as long as he's as long as you're here that's going to be a that's going to be a a sticker yeah is that right yeah F the word the prophet used he said it'll be a it'll be a um well anyway go beyond it he said it's going to bother you as long as you live here this outer man is going to bother you amen but you can go beyond that outer man amen go where go to where look unto Jesus amen who is he the word where is he in you what is he the new birth amen amen that's you all right we talk about the new birth and don't know who it is you say he must be born again but who is it and if that's who it is that's you amen where he said you must be born again right amen you were born in this life but now be born again the new cre creation it's God himself through the spoken word creating himself in you amen not another creation see God's a spirit he didn't create himself but he comes and creates himself in you just like he created himself in Mary yeah but not the same way that was natural this is a spiritual amen are you with me but before we meet him in the air we have that same Holy Ghost anointing this word and we're bringing through us the promised son yeah now think of that just like Sarah amen just like Mary Mary was the outside was the shuck Mary the shuck amen are you with me Mary outwardly she had Shu but inwardly she had the very creative act of God through the word God created himself a body the blood cell came in into Mary and Mary bore but now brother R said that that life that life well I read it right here it's seed time or bride time the Shucks are dead yeah amen the Shucks are dead all right the Shucks are dried up the Virgin what is this virgin word time not touched not touched by what not it's a virgin word time not touched and you go goes on to say no manhandling yeah okay then quit trying to manhandle it yeah because you create your own little denominational system right by trying to manhandle this word leave it alone that's right follow it obey it even though it's radical to your human thinking right uh-huh brother Brown said he does things in an unusual way in an unusual time in unusual circumstances he's always been that way he'll continue to do it he'll even he'll even change you to do things that are radical to your own human thinking right but follow him if you know where you whom you believed you know he's in you then follow him quit trying to quit trying to judge it by yourself right take his word and go follow it deny yourself right other words take up the cross die to your own I'm going to say it like way a long time ago that that a minister in the message said it your own stinking thinking yeah did die die to it you can't have any confidence in your own ideas and your reasoning if it leaves the word right reasoning is okay as long as it agrees with the word word but you've been given the Holy Ghost to know whether it does or doesn't that's right those without the Holy Ghost don't know the difference are you with me amen all right remember Pentecost made a way for the Holy Ghost himself to come right down back to the word again that's we're right right back here back to the word again the word is Manifest in flesh okay whose flesh mine if no one else in this room it's mine but I know there's others in this room amen it's yours also and together under that one Spirit we are united as one you may be different than me I may be different than you in the way the word is being manifested or preached even through me I differ from other preachers that I can't be what I differently than what I am right I'm different but oh am I happy Hallelujah all right so now now look so let's go on Virgin word time not touch it's a virgin remember a virgin word time if you put it in the hands of a denomination it sure won't be virgin it'll be manhandled time you get to it but God's church is not manhandled God's church is not touched by denomination you say hallelujah brother sister I'm telling you you can make your own little denomination and walk in it if you want to but I refuse to do that I've come out of the darkness of that spirit I refuse to let that Spirit have any control over me amen amen right and that spirit will always question the word of God and form its little opinion about it and it's a dominating female Catholic spirit that tries to come in and exist around the message yeah it's the same spirit I could take the rest of this sermon and just preach that but get us out of it Lord don't let us come under that don't make the mistake that Eve did and she stopped to listen right to his knowledge to to the to the tree of partake of the tree of Good and Evil that's the problem with it they're trying to mix it today they're trying to mix things together instead of Leaning it with the word and let the word declare itself you try to mix everything together and by mixing it you're bringing a spirit of confusion and God is not the author of confusion amen my peace I give to you my leadership I give to you I word I give to you let's keep it right there quit trying to mix it amen try to live over here and try to live over here and bring that Spirit of confusion nobody knows where they're standing amen just bring the word of Truth don't try to live between these two Realms either going to live in one or the other amen so let's let's decide right now yeah we're going to live by the word this revealed opened up I don't care how radical and how much van OD ball it is and how strange it may be you're the final voice to the final age amen right you're the final voice to the final age yes under your messenger which is the Holy Ghost himself to a Vindicated Prophet his word is the perfect interpretation of the word for this season is that not what Micah came back and answered 400 prophets with is what elah before him said and Elijah said and why they had the word oh my we have the word hallelujah they had the word why the word said that they give that Syria that's not their land that's our land that was the word but it was out of season for them to take it now at that time it was out of season how' they know it was out of season they all agreed it was in season see they were coming back the word so does the foolish virgin have the word but they don't have oil in their vessel to mix with that word that's right they brought their lamps Thy word is a lamp to my feet they had the lamp but they didn't have the oil in the vessel right to make the word like so they had no discernment no revelation of the word for the season they couldn't receive it right oh yes they were word material they were Sanctified material is that right but they didn't have the oil in the vessel the the the the real virgin wise virgin took oil in they had their lamp and had oil in their vessel yeah right there's the difference y good people yes will that foolish virgin real sanctified people get eternal life yes at the white Throne judgment but the bride doesn't stand before judgment she's judging she's in the throne right not standing Before the Throne she's in the throne there are those tribulation Saints out there on a sea of glass mixed with fire that are standing there before the throne right but they're in Tribulation they're in judgment Revelation 15 amen yeah amen the bride's gone yeah when that when that sister in as clear as glass that bride's gone showing no blood there anymore the sacrifice finished for the bride she's gone the fourth chapter tells her the message tells her she's under Rapture already she's gone spiritually already we're gone naturally we've got to catch up to it are you with me all right it must be spiritual Faith first to see the manifestation of a body change you've got to have it first in faith it's got to be revealed first everything that God did it was a revelation first yeah amen are you with me even your healing is a revelation right and then you see the manifestation of that Revelation because Faith makes a channel for the word to be manifested through hey man I don't know how I'm getting on that but evidently somebody needs it oh my all right watch this Hallelujah this Bride is a virgin born word of made Manifest this Bride is a virgin born word of God made manifest Jesus Christ the same yesterday today and forever hallelujah how wonderful I love it I believe it I know it's the truth it'll not be touched no man handling yeah David you put your name in it had not one thing to do with that seed being in me amen not one thing to do with it right still doesn't it's nothing to do with David that's right I'm going to read a scripture out of Romans 9 we'll show it to you if it didn't have anything to do with Jacob it doesn't have anything to do with you if it didn't have anything to do with Esau it didn't have anything to do with he he couldn't receive it Jacob was Jacob Esau was Esau but one was seed the other wasn't neither boy did anything in fact brother Bram said that Esau was a better moral man than Jacob now where are your judgment he made why Jacob was a Shyer a deceiver until he was changed that's right and man what did he meet out there in panu who' he wrestle with right yeah how did he come out of panu and come out of Dame's man he was the new creature he he he limped he limp By The Mark of the Holy Ghost and met him in his body he was a weakling but the word said and Paul said Jesus told him my strength is made perfect in your weakness yeah right my strength is made perfect in your weakness Hallelujah so quit trying to give me excuses of your weakness you're already weak and were meant to be weak then submit yourself to the new birth and let it grow laying in the presence of the sun eat the open book yeah right with that John ate the open book and it was in his mouth sweet as honey and when he had eaten it it made his belly bitter it made him limp he was marked probably the more he went and the more he grew in the word the more mistakes he made right yeah amen I mean I mean that would you just stop and think about that The Closer you get to God it seems like the more the more because why because it's so unveiled to you every little thing that's not light yeah is known and when the light uncovers what you're doing and you need to change it you've got a decision right now the light's shining on your pathway you have a decision you will either accept it or call me crazy am you'll either accept it or walk in the light God's given us so you're not going to walk in the light why because you're not able maybe not able and maybe you are but you just need to realize you're either able to receive it or you're not able to receive it well I'm a good person that is not going to put you in the Rapture there's more people that are better than I am far better as far as good concerned don't you look at your goodness as any evidence that you're going in because I'll tell I tell you there's none good no not one Jesus himself said why call me good why there's none good but God he knew who he was so do you bride you're realizing who you are your position you have been POS positionally placed in Christ you ought to thank him for that every moment of the day that you have been positionally placed in Christ and Christ in you is God's Great Revel amen amen amen amen all right now see I'm not going to get through this I don't know what time it is but anyway uh if you want to put the time up you can and maybe you better not all right all right all right I've already talked about the blood Ephesians chapter 2 let's we'll come back to Philippians in a minute again the Lord willing if iians chapter 2 verse uh 8 for by grace are you saved through faith if you want to go to to Romans 4 and I'll just I'll just I'll just quote it to you okay the reason it's revealed to you because in Romans 4 I can't find it well let me just a moment oh yeah there it Roman 4:16 let me just quote it therefore it is a faith that it might be by Grace Grace is not something you merited right Grace is the Divine enablement of God right Amen brother brand made it very simple if you need your back scratch I'll scratch it whether mine needs it or not yeah okay so so it's you've been enabled by God to be able to receive and to hear you're a special class of people God's enabled you given the ability to hear the word for the season and how do you hear the word for the season it's revealed see god holds that Revelation the difference between Cain and Abel was Revelation brother Brandon said that was was the only difference that's what made him offer a different sacrifice amen one by Revelation the other by his own intellectual knowledge of his father his religious knowledge thought God dwelt in Beauty thought it was an apple that eve eat if you think that let me just tell you something why did he have to be virgin born yes sir to take the stain of sin off he had to come through a woman because the fall came through a woman amen all right she received another she conceived another seed amen Abel only knew her twice once and then again after the killing of Abel yeah he hath appointed to me another seed and stood of able all right you see so we know that I many know that could be preached on I preached on it here before quite a number of two or three years ago two seeds if you remember that all right see a lot of the young people don't know that age to brother Paul there's a lot of young people don't know what happened I remember my daughter sitting back there I remember my children just about the age of 13 I didn't place it there but when they begin to know the difference between right and wrong and I had to bring just in Simplicity what happened in the garden you see see because that's the great issue today is that adultery that's right you know that okay okay we'll get off of that but but what I had my thought there going uh Ephesians 2 let's just go back to that for by Grace there you are by grace are you saved if by faith Abraham received with by faith that It Be by grace it was Grace what was the grace of God to Abraham that he revealed himself to Abraham amen that was Grace look what8 says for by grace are you saved through what faith yeah okay so by grace are you saved through faith God gives you because of what's laying inside of you he reveals himself right connects with the seed do you understand what I'm saying by Grace it's by grace you never see so David's not in it MH by Grace am I saved through faith through the working of God himself through faith amen and that and what what's that that that Faith that's not of yourselves it is the gift of God what's the gift of God eternal life so it is the gift of God now brother brandham made a statement here and now let's read it here in Ephesians chap 2 as we go on here verse 10 or verse 9 not of Works L any man should boast not of Works God did this predestinated this placed this before the foundation of the world to you that's amen are you with me all right not of Works lest any man should boast it's a gift of God for we are his Workman ship yeah it's all him it's his achievement for we are his workmanship created in Christ Jesus unto good works whose Works God's Own works his own Works through you I just read it to you he's working through you amen all right Jesus unto good works which God hath before ordained that we before ordained already ordained that you should walk in them so let go and let God have his wonderful way yeah he's your shepherd I shall not want you're not going to have anything you have need of or want that won't be provided amen he's determined to get you from here to a body change that's his determination and he won't and it can't fail right right you've already got the token that it won't fail amen then every day you ought to be applying the token amen token apply the token to your family apply it to your household apply it to your own self kick out the trash amen while we think on these things things that are lovely things that be a good report things that be any so on and so forth think on these things what's thinking do have to do with it creates an atmosphere it's an influence okay I'm getting off my path here okay let's get back the faith of God okay see in Union with Christ yours workmanship you are a new creature of God Amen that's verse 10 the faith of God in the word is the real believer the word living in the word living and in action is the bride she's the Living Word now you can find that right in Hebrews 12 the word is living and operative quicker more powerful than a two-edged sword living and operative living and in action the prophet said she would be the word Christ in you makes you the complete revelation of the whole thing Christ in you Christ in the world makes the word the complete revelation of Christ Christ in you will make you the complete Revelation so what is the complete Revelation the word it makes you the complete so we have the Capstone Revelation for the Rapture amen because now the mystery that was in God the mystery of Revel the message of Revelations 107 the mystery has been opened and you see and it's not something outside the word it's in the word faith in the word and you see then who you are there's your hidden Mystery Christ in you the mystery of God revealed you are the mystery of the second Adam hid in him before the foundation World placed in him and when he went to Calvary he went with you in him and the smiting of Christ was for a purpose just like it was Adam the mystery of Adam the mystery in Adam was now made manifest yes and it wasn't a different Adam it was Mrs Adam hello right it was Mrs Adam Mrs Adam was the mystery of Adam now revealed or made manifest the promise the promise was in the word right and she became the very unveiling of himself she was the Capstone revelation of that of of himself now when it comes back to where we are now we're ready for Eden again amen that's right we're we're ready to step right back into Eden God has a masterpiece family ready to step right back into Eden again because now the bride sees their position and sees who she's carrying yeah in her womb ready to be birthed into a new body yes amen is that right and who is it is none other but him that's right amen you had to come through your Pentecost just like Sarah and AD Abraham did they had to come through their Pentecost they had to come to a New Creation do you recognize what that is then she by that new creation laying in that promised word gained Faith to be able to conceive and when she conceived she brought forth a natural Seed of Abraham which they were looking for that promised son Hallelujah am talk about real right now what are we carrying before we come together we're found with child of the Holy Ghost amen are you with me here's the new birth it's exactly right back again here we are here's who you are bride here's your standing it's not just an imagination it's you are now found you're a cap Stone Revelation his Masterpiece remember there was another Masterpiece in the making another piece had to come back to the master we are no longer Twain We Are One the message of Revelation 10:7 is the mystery and that you are that mystery of God he said those seals were opened up to show the bride where she came from who she is and where she on her part and what she would be at the End Amen Hallelujah amen we're not looking at two different people here we are now received his glory and the glory of the Lord but the glory of the Lord is being veiled it's veiled unbelievers but it's wide open to those that believe it's not hid anymore to by denominational tradition you've left that old tradition we are now become we are beholding the bride coming of Christ that's the finished work of God that's what he wanted to finish that was what was in his mind that was his eternal purpose that was his choosing amen all right I'm just going on now I'm hurrying up I'm going ahead see because I've got to quit all right so the purpose Romans 9 I want you to turn with me I can't bypass that I got to turn there so there's nothing you have done or could do to redeem yourself he elected you his seed you had nothing to do with doing that yeah it was his election amen amen amen and amen well that gives me the license to anything I want yes it does but you'll not do anything contrary to the word because you cannot being the word see you cannot disbelieve the word it'll stay with that word because that's your nature that's who you are you are the word you are the nature of the word and you bring forth the character of the word amen amen amen okay so here watch he said now Romans 9 I've got to get back over here I'm almost beside myself with this and I've just got to settle down and finish all right okay Romans 9 and we I could read a lot you just have to go back and read it but starting with with uh verse eight that is they which are of the children they which are the children of Flesh these are not the children of God right my these which are not the children these which are the children of Flesh are not the children of God but the children of the promise seed the children of the word the children of the promise are counted for the seed yeah amen amen amen for the word for This Is The Word of Promise at that time watch what he said This Is The Word of Promise at that time so let's bring it down to our time at that time will I come yeah and Sarah shall have a son Jesus said as it was in the days of Sodom and Gomorrah where the word was manifested in flesh before us yeah he stood right there knowing the secret a sign pointing to a voice to follow it and he said and you're the voice the message was the voice the opening of the seals were the voice and under that message you are the final com you are the final voice you're not going to say something different you're going to Proclaim it because you're the seed Word of Promise amen amen and so here we are right here and he says for I will I come and Sarah shall have a son I'll visit you in the time of life and here's the time brother Braham said we've arrived to it it's the time of life and this is seed time amen bride time bride age Rapture time lifetime I'll visit you in the time of life and Sarah shall have that [Music] son and they had to go even after their change their body change it went down to Greer and Satan almost overtook her trying to stop that conception are you with me how many times have you been tested while while the word is taken something in on and changed you you've been through your Pentecost but now you've got to grow in faith she couldn't she had to grow up to where she could receive she could know she could accept she could hear right she could conceive conceive seed yeah then where was The Promised son this promised son this seed shall not this Hagar's son shall not be Heir with my son right she spoke it right out and this promised seed that we are shall not be air with this Shuckle bur a Shuckle this carnal seed that's right this denominational seed maybe it's a new word I don't know Shuckle bir I can't even say it now all right all right now anyway okay can you give me about five minutes or so I just got to finish some of this because I don't have every time to just take part two and three and four and all this all right now the faith of God the word is the real believer all right now so now for at this time the Word of Promise before I go there Philippians 2:5 said let this mind be in you you I was going to go there but let this mind be in you which was also in Christ Jesus who being in the form that's imorph are you with me that's in morphe what was in morphe God himself changing his mask steps down into another a part of the drama this curtain Rises he's a he's the same person but a different mask I'll just let that speak for itself who being in the form of God Jesus said who being in the form of God let this mind be in you who being in the form of God in morphe what form is he in now he's in you but what form is he in Bride being in the form of God thought it not robbery to be equal with God so he didn't go out and make himself a reputation you see a man trying to pump himself up make himself a reputation there's something wrong with his relationship with the Lord right see but he committed himself even to death the death of the cross just like we should do every day take up our cross amen deny ourself and take his word and following sell all that you have he asked the Rich Young Ruler sell what you got I know there's people sitting right here now that may God may say to you sell what you have and follow me other words give it over to me give everything give it up give it over I'm afraid if I do this and this will happen this and this will happen this and this will happen if I just yield completely to God to what he called me to do this and this might happen you're not willing to sell out he said he had he told me he said when he called me I'm just going to give a personal testimony when he called me I thought of this many times didn't think about it until not too long ago I thought that's exactly what you did Lord but that had nothing to do with David that was that seed responding that's what the Rich Young Ruler failed to have yeah he wouldn't follow God's command because in his reasoning it looked too unreasonable but then when he did then he tried probably still religious still went to church still said I believe the word I believe the Commandments and tried to mix the two together and where did he find himself in hell all right so you've got and he told me he said I want you to sell your business and to make it real clear to me it wasn't me he spoke to it was somebody else not knowing one or the other even hearing it sell all sell your business and go full-time Ministry I wonder how many ministers he's asked that to tell them that sell what you got get rid of what you got I want you to go full-time but Lord you know now Lord I I I built up this and I'm well favored among the people and I've done all this look at the years I've spent in it look at the years I put why all that lord I can't go to waste you know I want you to follow me I want you to sell out yeah he might ask you to sell like he did the Rich Young it might be some other things he wants you to sell and get in your position very quickly because if we don't get in each one in our position we're hurting the body yes amen we're hurting the body that's right God expects you to obey amen if you refuse to obey and if you're elect seed he'll stay on me until you do because he's going determined to get you where you need to be if it takes the very strength out of you to do it God doesn't care about that he's going to get you where you need to be you're going to have to mature in your position all right place so he's in morphe he's changed his mask we understand that I'm going to move on that he's embodied himself in you the full Revelation self the hidden Mystery of the seventh seal the ministry of the seventh angel the seventh seal you are the gift of God wrapped up you are God's wrapped gift all right now so he said for This Is The Word of Promise at this time I'm back in Romans n9ine I will come and Sarah shall have a son and not only this but when when Rebecca also conceived one by Our Father Isaac for the children listen to this for the children not being yet born neither having done any good or evil see nothing to do with it that the purpose of God according to election might stand not of works but of him that calleth if we didn't have election where would we be that's right you see so on on paragraph I may I can't get to everything I'm going to have to stop but paragraph and I'll have to pick it up as a part two but paragraph 163 on page 163 of this church age book you know which one I'm handling this one okay 163 you'll find it in a different page on the other hardback I mean the original now no sir it is the groom who decid es and chooses a certain woman for his bride you have not chosen me but I have chosen you John 15:6 now according to the word of God how see how did he choose us by for knowledge right now according to the word of God the bride was chosen before the foundation of the world the choosing of the bride was purposed in himself the choosing of the bride was purposed in himself Ephesians 1:9 and the and that's Eternal purpose and in Romans 91 911 I just read to you that the purpose of God according to election might stand the purpose of God according to election now listen the heart purpose the heart purpose these are powerful words the heart purpose the Eternal purpose of God was to take a bride of his own choosing yeah and that purpose was in himself and being Eternal was decreed before the foundation of the world amen amen amen that's right let go and let God have his wonderful way release you're trying to judge yourself by your feelings and your actions and trying to determine whether God's in you or Not by your reasoning about the word and Satan just twisting you around his face what's the word say about you tell me do you believe it what's your soul say about it God chose you his heart purposes to have a bride now who's going to stand in his way one of them I'm one of them how do you know Brother David I've been identified as one of them he identified me as that by unveiling himself in me and I look here in the word and that's exactly what he said he would do and I see it working amen all right so being Eternal and decreed before the foundational world watch carefully and see this before there was ever a specka stardust before God was God God is an object of adoration and no one is there to worship him so he he at that time only potentially God he was known only as an eternal spirit the bride was already in his mind yes she was she was existing in his thoughts and what about those thoughts of God of God thoughts of God do you know that God has Eternal thoughts of himself you know he knows everything but God has Eternal thoughts of himself and you were existing in those thoughts amen you were existing substance existing you weren't just an imagination you were existing yeah as substance in his mind yes she was she was existing in his thoughts and the brother BR says are they not they are Eternal are those thoughts Eternal and what about those thoughts of God are they Eternal are they not they are Eternal are they not excuse me the Eternal thoughts of God let me ask you are the thoughts of God Eternal if you can see this you will see many things all right then all he is he never had a new thought about anything because all of his thoughts he has always had and always will have and knows the end from the beginning because he's God this is the thoughts of God that thus excuse me thus the thoughts of God are Eternal they are real yeah amen and he expressed those thoughts when he expressed his word in the beginning yeah and he he said you're my Witnesses because you were with me from the beginning and we read in St John 1 the beginning was the word the word in the beginning was the word and the Word was God God and the Word was with God there you [Music] areh with God existing in his thoughts and so you and I don't have time go into it I'll just give you what I'm going to bring here the next time Lord willing if I can you are his spoken word seed amen amen and a spoken word is a thought expressed that's right you are his thought expressed you are the Original Seed you are then the original life amen you are the resurrection and you are the Rapture amen all right let's just finish this off I don't have time to stop it there I just want to go back here and pick up something because I had those things I wanted to read about the spoken word seed there's three different definite quotes on that I wanted to bring to you I'll bring it next time but I want to take what brother Paul finished his message with last Sunday or last Sunday yeah it's been a week already last Sunday 12:04 Rapture paragraph 65 but to the church let me just read up ahead of this a little bit we know we've been bought back amen and we were seed to only the elect can be reborn because only the elect is seed and why did he love Jacob and not Esau because Jacob was seed I don't have to go into all that because that was his thought his thought Jacob was his thought and that thought was expressed and Jacob was born right all right Jacob was the seed so it didn't have anything to do with outside of Jacob it was the seed that God saw and he determined to bring Jacob to his position and he did he went through a lot of suffering and a lot of things to get there but he got there is that right all right all right he was his thought and you go back you'll hear what brother Brown said there you go back in church a book and read about what thought of Jacob why did he love Jacob because Jacob was his thought yeah and that thought expressed was seed so Jacob had the seed well you have never chose Jacob right that's right and that wouldn't have chose me either right that's right but he chose me amen because he was determined he'd have a bride and he' pour his own life into that bride identifying her as himself you passed from death the life amen that's it that's it it's finished you raised with him you've already raised with him did you know that you've already raised with him when he raised you raised with him then he arose me raised me up with him in the resurrection and now we're seated with him in power and authority over every devil oh if you could only believe what God has given but if you're not seated there you don't have it if you are seated there and don't believe it and afraid to move you'll never use it but if you are seated there you will use it for you're ordained to do what you do amen and we raised with him in the resurrection and now we're ascended by his Spirit to the throne of grace sitting together in Heavenly places in Christ Jesus I died with him I was in him then and I died with him amen H you just you just keep going on and on you're raised with him yeah do you believe you raised with him then it's finished it's finished do you realize it's finished God's no longer judging you by the flesh boy that was a good one let me say that loud and clear God is no longer judging you by the flesh he did that to Israel when he gave the law but Grace fulfilled the law amen he's not judging you that I have the quote right here if I just hit it real quick see he's not judging you by the flesh he isn't amen well you just I if you want to find it I can get it for you but what's happening we are now now we become Anointed with the same Spirit anointed messiah messiah who is the Messiah the anointed one anointed word that's the Messiah the Christ now we are the anointed Messiahs of the last day to shine forth the resurrect ction of Jesus Christ to show that he's not dead but in the form of the Holy Ghost he's in his people moving among his bride with a love affair to her pouring out kenos what's kenos pouring out himself not another person without of him the same person amen kenos amen pouring out pouring out brother BR said that was a pouring out what did he do all that God was he poured into Christ all that Christ was he born into his body his bride you and me right amen you're born again you and me He poured out himself pouring out himself what are we doing what's happening we're laying in the presence of the son he's pouring out himself into you you are in Union with him receiving his life amen the veil is broken boy I wish I could stick that when when it shall turn to the Lord the veil is taken away amen that old traditional Veil is broken you are united you are married to the lamb the blood shows it you adults you know what I'm talking about but I'm talking about the spiritual right the veil's broken we now with open face are beholding as in the glass the glory of the Lord amen he's not sharing that with this to everybody he'll share it with himself nobody else you're not another he said he wouldn't share it with another but brother sister you're not another you are his glory you are his glory amen and you're veiled the veil is over you hiding that Glory do you realize that he's hid but fully manifested what does this make you and I the full revelation of Jesus Christ so he said they are becoming one for the wedding supper pouring out kenos into her himself they are becoming one for the wedding supper and the same signs promised by the same God and the same word is making the same manifestations there's nothing left but for us to do but believe it and to believe it is the substance and that creates a perfect Faith there you are amen amen amen and okay so St 1 John 4:4 said greater is he that is in you he in you what's this what's the Bible say in 1 John 4:4 you are of God yeah amen not another when he keos poured himself he poured himself into you it's himself here I wonder how many SE is coming really SE is coming because the ministry of the seventh seal the mystery of the seventh seal was his coming amen that's why it can only be revealed to the bride cuz she's the only one that'll see his coming because she is fulfilling that promise yeah amen oh my sorry brother Paul I'm just going too far over time but tomorrow may be the Rapture today may be the Rapture amen amen I'm closing so it's no longer David living but Christ Our identification you are his eternal possession just rest in that you are his eternal possession then where does your confidence lay amen I wish I could find that quote there he's no longer judging us by the flesh but I know I have it right here but anyway oh there it no it isn't okay all right oh there it is right there Ians 4:24 see I didn't read that scripture and that you put on the new man which after God has created in righteousness and true Holiness the new creation is not the old creation made over right see or could it be called or it could not be called if it was it could not be called a new creation that is exactly what it says it is New Creation is it is another creation distinct means separated from from the old one no longer is he dealing by way of the flesh there it is that's how he dealt with Israel but now out of every Kindred tribe and Nation he has purposed a new creation he is the first of that creation he was God created in the form of man now by his Spirit he's creating listen to those words many sons unto himself but the Creator God excuse me God the Creator creating himself a part part of his creation there it is all right now thank you Lord so you were in his thinking that's it now closing under super sign we are most graciously Lord accepting and by the way I meant to greet those online I don't know who's online but greetings to all those online you're listening in I know

that will I do if my coming husband wants me to let my hair grow I'll do so quit trimming it just as simple as that you trim that hair you might as well shave it off because the trim your hair is cut it and when you cut it it's no longer long hair is given to you for a covering it wasn't length the length of your hair it's whether you cut it or not because if you don't cut your hair in God's eyes you have long hair and it's for a covering and you're keeping a Nazarite vow to him alone I'm reading about this this is a Nazarite vow right is a marriage covenant too yeah will you keep the only unto him so long as you both shall live will you keep you only under her see husband love your wives as Christ loved the church wives reverence and respect your husbands oh but you don't I won't go

devil talking to you you already have a birth don't listen to him all right because I'm telling you when you have a birth you're still going to make mistakes in the flesh but that word makes no mistakes why because that word that's unveiled in you is the perfect one and so are you in his eyes amen all right everything he requests to do that will I do if my coming husband wants me to let my hair grow I'll do it if he wants me to take off all this makeup I'll do it now we could go on and on oh yeah well he goes on if he wants if he tells me it's an evil spirit the evil one I'm flirting with with these sexy looking clothes I'll do it I'll take them off I don't care what anybody else says I'll take them off he wants me to come out of that group that I'm with of unbelievers I'll do it though I make my bread or whatever it is he promised he would never leave me nor forsake me I'll do it I'll go with him all the way he wants me to be baptized in his name I'll do it Lord you promis it in your word here and that's what you wanted May every person see it Lord and sweetly and humbly bow to it amen I say again deny yourself he said take up your cross and follow me thus bow our heads Lord Jesus if I didn't know that you were in absolute control I would be a nervous wreck right now knowing I've taken so long but Lord I know this that was committed to to you before I walked over at this platform and Lord you have control it's not I it's you the people have heard your word there's people here that absolutely love it and receive it and Lord that's who it's sent to and Lord Jesus we just ask you right now as we humbly bow in your presence I will go with you all the way I say that from the sincerity and Revelation in my heart knowing where I stand and who I am I have no other head but you you're the head of the body you have the preeminence over me and Lord I will follow and Lord if I didn't say that if I just said that in my own makeup and just may it may fail but Lord knowing that that's come from a revelation of my heart then lord it's going to take place it's got to Lord you said it I say it I confess it back and Lord Jesus we love you we appreciate the word you've given to us may the people take this not the word of a man but the word of God and a perfect interpretation given to us by a Vindicated Prophet who you stepped into and the sword was in your hand and Lord we have a perfect interpretation by Divine Vindication and when we looking back at what Elijah said we have the interpretation of the hour and the promise of the hour and we refuse to add to that or take from it Lord I believe it let everyone here say it so where you said in Psalms let the bride let her let her say let her say so let her say so Lord we're saying so Thy word is my joy and my salvation my Redemption my peace my rock my strength all in all we give you praise in Jesus name amen amen I'd like to sing up this sing this song all is well all is well do you believe all is well amen amen and forgive me I trust you forgive me if I've taken your time and overtime then just pray for me that something will change me because I don't care how much I try I can't stop until God stops stops me so you just pray if I'm doing wrong then you pray for me that God will you go to my head about it amen amen okay all is well is it raise your hands if you believe that all is well

let's sing it one more time all is [Applause] well all is we have receive it Lord we receive it and good morning bride of shalom is a place of perfect rest behind the rest for all I told you I can't stop until God stops me he said you forgot you said read that message that that quote now I said I would read what brother Paul left on Sunday and I didn't go to it the Lord brought it back to my remembrance here it is Rapture 1965 paragraph 65 but to the church the bride the Rapture is a revelation to her it's revealed to her now brother sister after what we've heard this morning who is this the Rapture is a person the Rapture is Jesus Christ you are the Rapture the Rapture is a person and it's revealed to her praise the Lord that the Revelation the true bride of Christ will be waiting for that revelation of the Rapture now it's a revelation for the Revelation is Faith you cannot have a revelation without it being faith faith is a revelation because it's something that's revealed to you faith is a revelation faith is something that's been revealed to you like it was to Abraham that could call anything contrary to that Revelation that's revealed to him as though it wasn't so right let's walk by that Faith [Music] amen page 32 things that are to be you say I got the baptism of the Holy Ghost the reason brother Brown saying this because you can have the baptism of Holy Ghost and still go to hell because if it doesn't fall on his seed there's no birth but it fell on some seed because the rain falls un just and unjust so you can still have the baptism the rain how many understand what I just said amen all right so you still have the baptism the rain all right that still has nothing to do with it that's just only a temporal gift for you and you must have the baptism don't get me wrong you've got to have it the only way that seat can be quickened so repent everyone of be baptized in the name of Jesus Christ for the remission of sin and you shall receive this gift that we've been talking about of the Holy Ghost amen amen this revealed Christ all right in you now he said the real gift he said that's just a temporal gift but the real gift is your soul down in there that was born of God and that controls the whole thing to the word of God controls the whole thing to the word of God and the will of God and there you grow up amen that real start is in your soul even before there was a spirit it was your soul that Soul didn't come from God then it wasn't a germ of God and it had to come from one or the other it was either the seed of Satan or the seed of God there it is amen sorry but I had to get that out now let's sing two more songs are you with me all right let's sing two more here let's sing let's sing take up the cross and follow and that's page
