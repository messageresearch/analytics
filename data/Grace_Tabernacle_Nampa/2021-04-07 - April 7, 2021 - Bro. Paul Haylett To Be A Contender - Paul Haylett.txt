world today you know i don't want to get sidetracked this evening but you know just as you attempt i guess you might say to follow what is happening in the world around us it is so amazing my brother and sister how that things are coming together as as prophesied as the word has declared it's just it's coming together and it's as though that they don't want to you read little excerpts leadership of different churches they say well we still feel like we have a great difference but we feel compelled to join together my you see the word of god will come to pass amen so they're anointed even against their own better judgments to to step into to be a part of to join in and and uh just wait till they cancel culture makes it to christianity it's coming they'll stand one day and say you're not even a christian yes that's all right because their definition of christianity is not our definition of christianity hallelujah amen you know i hope you can catch my thought here otherwise you're going to think i'm nuts but you know they say in business real estate investing and things like that go counter to the culture when everyone's buying sell and everyone's selling by now look at that bring that over into the world we live in today everyone's crying unity unity unity but the word speaking out to us i believe with all my heart the word speaking out to us saying come out of her my people it's not a time see we're uniting to christ it's not a time to unite in this world in a in a human uh unity and so he's saying come out of her and they're saying come together hallelujah oh thank you lord hallelujah sorry about my random thoughts amen let's just stand as we go into the word tonight just want to speak once again out of the book of proverbs these age-old proverbs i want to go to chapter 17. i want to just kind of draw a little bit of main emphasis that really struck me as i was reading this and i want to title this tonight to be a contender amen i believe that's what each and every one of us's hearts desire is is to be a contender it is interesting i'm going to take a little turn on these words after a bit here and just trust you can follow me tonight better is a dry morsel and quietness therewith than a house full of sacrifices with strife i think we can just stop and say amen to that one right there a wise servant shall have rule over a son that calls us shame and shall have part of the inheritance among the brethren the fining pot is for silver and the furnace for gold but the lord trieth the hearts a wicked doer giveth heed to false lips and a liar giveth ear to a naughty tongue who so mocketh the poor reproacheth his maker and he that is glad at calamities shall not be unpunished now i want to just make comment on verse 5 just real quick that verse strikes me very strongly because you see saints growing up people's representation of the message was anything but stellar just reminds me i had a good friend as a young boy his name was jonathan and jonathan's parents had kind of showed interest in the message until certain things happened and then they pushed back very very hard against the message i don't know that they were so opposed to the message but they were certainly opposed to the hypocrisy one day you see we grew up swimming in the in the low lying canal and now they don't you know even allow that they'll cite you for trespassing above what would be called the checks where's all these pipes at every check that would come out and water would go to irrigation and my friend jonathan one day while swimming with some friends they started floating down the canal and jonathan said hey i forgot something or whatever actually i think it was the keys to his pickup and and he said i'll be with you in a second but he never shows up his pickup's still there they can't find him ultimately they determined that jonathan had dove into the canal and hit one of those pipes directly and of course whatever it did to him you know caused him to drown and people in the church that i attended as a young man rose up and said that's god's punishment for them for not accepting the message god help us to never never never ever because you see that spirit won't stop with the unbeliever once they say this my brother and sister they say the cannibals will cannibalize their own when they fail to find someone else never ever ever let that spirit in our midst we know the word of god says things happen to the rich and to the poor to the righteous and to the unrighteous amen let's never allow that devil to come in and cause us to start thinking god did that to them because they didn't agree with us oh my a wicked doer giveth heed to false lips and a liar give ear to naughty tongue whoso market the poor reproacheth his maker and he that is glad at calamities shall not be unpunished children's children are the crown of old men and the glory of children are their fathers excellent speech becometh not a fool much lest do lying lips a prince a gift is as a precious stone in the eyes of him that hath it whithersoever it turneth it prospereth he that covereth a transgression seeketh love but he that repeateth a matter separateth very friends a reproof entereth more into a wise man than a hundred stripes unto a fool an evil man seeketh only rebellion therefore a cruel messenger shall be sent against him let a bear robbed of her whelps meet a man rather than a fool in his folly think about that when saints i might i've run into a bear one time in the woods fortunately it had a lot of other things on its mind and i'm telling you it's bear season and the bear was running popped out of the brush just a few feet in front of me and we both stopped and both of our eyes got really big and it ran away and i simply stood there in neutral and went i wouldn't want to be this and look at this a bear robbed of her welts meet a man rather than a fool in his folly that's pretty severe judgment in my mind amen whoso rewardeth evil for good evil shall not depart from his house the beginning of strife is as when one litteth out water therefore leave off contention before it be meddled with he that justifieth the wicked and he that condemneth the just even they both are abomination to the lord pretty strong words right there wherefore is there a price in the hand of a fool to get wisdom seeing he hath no heart to it a friend loveth at all times and a brother is born for adversity oh isn't that beautiful i love verse 17 amen a friend loveth at all times and a brother is born for adversity heavenly father we just ask you this evening lord once again as we look at these age-old proverbs father i i believe it would do us well lord if we would just continue not just for a few services but maybe all the days of our life just to come back and be reminded father lord how beautiful it is to serve you and the wisdom that you give us lord guidance your guiding hand upon us lord to know that father the only failure that we truly will ever have in our life will be the failure to let you lead our life and lord we thank you for your grace mercy tonight be with the saints father my own mother lord give strength to her lord our brother sergey i don't know father may be out on the road those who are not here tonight lord we thank you for the surgery that was for our sister shannon hofer lord for the circumstances the doctors felt like it went very well just ask your father to give life and to those bones that have died and lord give healing to her we ask in the name of jesus christ amen you may be seated you know as i look through this i i want to kind of focus on the the parts not necessarily to be selfish but focus on those things that really stirred my heart and as we look at this my brother and sister we'll look at verse 2 real quick a wise servant shall have rule over a son that calls us shame and shall have part of the inheritance among the brethren i just like to say this that i had to learn this lesson it is something that just didn't come natural i it took some bitter tears took a lot of prayers took a time of coming back into my own son and to look him in the face one day and be repentant on my own side on my own part because i was without wisdom in dealing with my son and this verse just strikes me my brother and sister a wise servant not just any old person not just one that demands obedience not one that is more worried about what someone else thinks but one that is wise shall rule over a son that causes shame and you know it reminds me of a statement that uh you know i heard many years ago there's various uh renditions of this but the statement is rules without respect leads to rebellion and so it is there that as our children or spouse or parents whatever it might be as as they uh go through struggles in their life i pray god gives each one of us wisdom how to deal with that and you know things come about that sometimes you know things still are not necessarily like we would want them to be but you uh with wisdom can open the conversation in such a fashion that they know exactly where you stand but because they know you're sincere they know you love them they're able to receive the words without rebellion so you're able to say i don't agree with what you are doing and this is why and they don't flare up at you they don't fight back at you because they know you respect them they know that you love them they know that your care for them is is of a nature that they might not agree with at the moment but they know that you're not they're just criticizing they're not just putting them down and and you know so i i just that verse struck me you know actually this whole verse chapter 17 has so many little tidbits that touch my own life that it would sound like i would just be sharing my story tonight but i i don't want to do that so i'll try not to but saints i just want you to remember as we deal with our children whether they're you know you know just at the age they're starting to understand uh let us deal with wisdom let us by god's grace pray through of how to deal with things and what to say and when to say it and you know i'll just share this little tidbit i know my son won't matter you know my son fought when he was young that uh his mom and dad was a little hard on him in fact it's a cute little story if you can see the humor in it that jerry one time found our son sitting out behind the house talking to the dog and kind of complaining to the dog that his mother was so mean you know the dog i guess was the only sympathetic one around the house but you know our son he kind of grew up feeling like his parents had been hard on him some people call it a middle child syndrome isn't it amazing how many syndromes there are there's one for the oldest child there's one for the middle child there's one for the youngest child there's one for the only child and so you know we can find an excuse for almost anything but you know one day my son is on the phone and he goes dead he goes i thought i'd ask you a question and i was like okay what what is it and he said what do you do with a 12 year old who will not do his school work will not listen and i said son go stand in the mirror and ask yourself that question he had good humor that day he said i've already done that and i have no answer you see it is the reality that we experience but we don't always convey we can't convey that we can't share the life lesson so therefore we need to saints have a compassion as it is for our children that the struggle they're going through that you're saying if you i know none of you ever did this but you know some of us did and if you just listen to me you'll have the answer don't we wish that worked but you see they have to go and experience it for themselves and if we recognize that natural and spiritual type together that sometimes what we have experienced what we've went through is so real to us that we would like to i just say this figurative i'm not picking on no one or trying to imply anything we'd like to go out maybe to the young people and be able to just grab a hold of them and say just listen to me but what we need to do is have a compassion to realize it doesn't work like that it didn't work for you it didn't work for your parents it didn't work for your parents parents all the way down into the history of your family it didn't work that way and so what we need to do by god's grace is have a wisdom on how to deal with because this struggle is very real to that individual as the scripture speaking to that son that struggle is very real it is not a just listen to me you won't go through it they have to go through it they have to experience it just like our children must come to the place that they recognize even though being born in a family in the house of god all the days of their life they are a sinner they've got to come to that it isn't enough that we can just say you were raised in the church your fine children everything will be fine they must come to the position that they recognize without jesus christ i'm lost but i never did anything evil i never done anything wrong how can i be lost it is not that you are simply under that covenant of born in sin and shaped in iniquity and we have to break that covenant amen and so it's there that we come and and you can't just cuddle your children you can't cuddle a son you must come but it must be in wisdom and it must be in love or otherwise we build a wall of rebellion because there's no respect god help us you'll see it sometimes in the preacher and how he treats people hopefully i'm not sound like a hypocrite here but when you see a preacher that speaks down on the people and is harsh with them what happens is is the human nature raises up a little wall he doesn't care about my situation he doesn't understand and if we're not careful it just shuts it off you see all else aspects of this we must have the wisdom how to deal with this and we see how god come down in the form stepped into it of jesus christ that was god himself and you see god didn't come down as a great mighty spiritual as it were warrior and just come and say do this but he lived out the example he he was hungry he was tired he felt friendless he he faced all the adversity he was spit on he was mistreated in every fashion and my brother and sister he didn't turn to an assistant and say you know what deal with them but he accepted that and with wisdom and we can look at that and see the wisdom as he deals with a son who has brought shame what is the wisdom he brings to you and i love and redemption and i pray that we would approach people that we interact with whether they've been in the are in the message have been in the message or headed out of the message coming to the message let us come with wisdom and love to show them really is a difference it's not just words you see we're coming down my brother and sister and you might think this is a silly example to bring but we're coming down to a time that it's just words has become the predominant factor in the world we live in today our politicians say this do this church leaders say this do this comes right down to every every aspect of everything that talk is cheap behavior can be anything and so you see the natural typing the spiritual what's happening the church is saying we're spiritual and we have need of nothing but yet their whole life is not one bit different than the world around them so the world around them says if that's what being a christian is then i don't need to be one because i'm just like they are but god in love and wisdom has come down and showed you and i that there is a life that we can take a hold of that is a life-changing life amen and that's what we want those around us to see that god give us wisdom god give us wisdom hallelujah remember rules without respect simply leads to rebellion i've been there i've been there as a young man sorry about my rant in verse three the finning pot the finding pot is for silver and the furnace for gold but the lord trieth the hearts and you know we look at this my brother and sister and realize that as we look through scripture we read the quotes and and talk about as it were uh the the refining fire uh and we look at that but you know god placing in us uh this uh value that is actually much greater than gold will look in revelations the second chapter the thytiran church agent it says there in this scripture that he searches the reigns in the hearts of man and and it's in there that he comes as a refining fire to cleanse us amen and it is my brother and sister such a a powerful word because as he's speaking to the thy tyrant church age he's he's laying down to them the very foundation of what is coming of what god is doing and how that the church in its present stage in those days was uh okay it was in you might say the will of god god had a judgment for them but they were in the will of god god was working through the church but god was telling them through the word that i'm going to purify you or bring you to a higher level and as time went on there's different quotes where brother brown says i tried to to not bring a lot of them tonight for the sake of time but brother branham uh talks about all those messengers coming right up into the philadelphian church age coming up into the pentecost movement brother branham says they all rejected the final move of the holy ghost you see when god come to finally do the purifying to to come down in that final final act my brother and sister it's one thing to have a piece of gold dug out of the earth it's another thing to take that gold and chip all the rock away from it and another thing to then put it in there and melt it down but you know if you understand those kind of things you don't just get it hot and it comes out clean meant a lot of revivals through the ages that didn't produce anything you see god had to just like a man and when he's melting these things down to purify that you have to put some kind of there's different terms for it but you have to put some kind of a flux in there that causes the impurities oh i hope you see this causes the impurities to draw together amen and causes the gold to come clean oh we're living in an age my brother and sister that god's putting something into the midst of the church that is causing the impurities to come together like never before never before have these people come been so bold and been so vocal to push against the word of god while declaring what you believe is wrong wrong wrong but yet they're completely outside of the word of god and what they don't realize the flux of the holy ghost is coming down in the midst of the church he's testing and changing and cleaning the hearts and the impurities are drawing together and becoming vocal you say why do you say vocal because when you add the flux depending on what kind of material you're using the impurities rise to the top and the first thing you see is the impurity and the only thing unless you deal with it is you will see the impurity so what happens the wheat and the tear must be separated and it is the move of the holy spirit that's coming down causing this separation and the word is coming to such a place my brother and sister this might sound a little harsh a little judgmental i don't mean it to be but it is a stark reality that god's pouring more of the holy spirit in causing the hearts to come and the hearts desire see he's checking out the heart he's not making the heart follow he is there refining as it were giving every opportunity to the heart to reach out and seek more of god and then it says in that season in that time that the tares would be bound as it would we used to doing different things melting things down you add the flux to that and then you can sweep all the impurities off the top we were making rifle bullets out of lead and so not exactly a precious metal but we wanted it to be clean we wanted to make good bullets out of it to shoot them and you see my brother and sister to me it's a very real thing he's searching the hearts now we'll look here in malachi 3 and we'll see now as we look at this in malachi 3 he said behold i send my messenger and he shall prepare the way before me and the lord whom ye seek shall suddenly come into his temple even the messenger of the covenant whom you delight and behold he shall come saith the lord of hosts but who may abide the day of his coming and who shall stand when he appeareth for he is like a refiner's fire and like fuller's soap so in this case we recognize the fuller soap is the additive that causes a separation and he shall sit as a refiner and a purifier of silver and he shall purify the sons of levi and purge them as gold and silver that they may offer unto the lord and offering in righteousness now you see my brother and sister every one of these is a reference that he is like a refiner's fire and like fuller soap and he shall sit as a refiner and he shall you see how this is laying out this he's looking at the heart and he's putting the flux as i've already spoken he's already putting that in which is the holy ghost in our hour and it's putting it in there and that holy spirit is coming now my brother and sister will see christ in two dispensations in in the day that we live in he either comes as our redeemer or he comes as our judge there's this two simply two positions we can call him redeemer but if our life is not worthy of the gospel he's actually coming as judge regardless of what we say and we talk about communion you know that we should judge ourselves you see what a lovely opportunity we've been given to uh open ourself up uh to the presentation as it were of the holy spirit and let the word of god come like the fuller soap right because it's actually the word that causes a separation amen we know the word is christ himself but we see that that it's the word that comes and is the final separation and so it's coming and even though we know malachi 3 doesn't directly apply to our day right this was really actually to john's day but the word my brother and sister applies to all of us and so it is there what is this make an offer unto the lord an offering not in its beauty not in its uh uh uh vast quantity not in any thing but righteousness that's what god's looking for he's looking for the offer in righteousness you see the man with an unclean heart could offer a perfect lamb didn't change anything he was a man with an unclean heart so as we look at this i just want to keep going here tonight um a wicked doer giveth heed to false lips i could give you so many examples that go with this but i'm restraining myself from things through the years that we we've heard stories shared uh uh some actually were directly affected to sister jerry and i through the years statements that were made and people heard it and believed it and were certain of its validity but my brother and sister you see uh just because someone uh uh listens to something you know as it were gossip and uh believes that and goes forth and shares that we have to make sure see we have people my brother and sister are so concerned that they'll be deceived but they listen to everything my lord help us you know what in business we have something i apply constantly because we deal with a multitude of people and that is trust but verify so i don't look at anyone and say i'm not going to trust them but i have a way of going and verifying what we're doing or whether or not what they're saying is correct now i like verse six we can get on a happy note here some of you smile on this especially those of you got grandchildren children's children are the crown of old men now i've got children's children i'm a grandfather so i guess i'm an old man but i'll tell you there's something special about them you know you like them in small doses you know grandchildren are are so lively they're so full of energy that after a while they simply wear you out but there's something about seeing them you're going to be frustrated and want to spank them yesterday and when you see them today all you want to do is kiss them the glory children are their fathers excellent speech becometh not a fool much less do lying lips a prince you know the apostle paul come and he said i do not come to you in excellency of speech here was an educated man of all the apostles he's a man that had an ability to speak in such a fashion that no doubt he can convince by the very words and the approach of using those words he could convince by that but see god anointed him not to come in the excellency of speech because a man that is persuaded against his will is unpersuaded still and so it's not about how persuasive we are my brother and sister this is why the prophet of god over and over and over again is talking about the gospel the message of the hour coming in this day and what what the christ the threefold manifestation of christ and over and over again he says this can't be explained it has to be a revelation it can't be explained otherwise someone with a a beautiful speech with beautiful words can lay it all out so correctly as to why this is why it should be what it is and many people then come and the prophet of god also speaks about that is kind of an intellectual revelation of the word for the hour and my brother and sister we don't want an intellectual revelation let it come first into the strength in its in our heart and then as we come god opens page after page after page line after line until we see what the plan of god is and see our place in it and how we fit so intricate into that plan we are not just shoved into it my brother and sister let me tell you put it this way now some would not agree with this approach but my brother and sister because knowing that we would have the mind of christ knowing that we are the very portion as the prophet of god says we are the half of him and that makes the whole do you realize the whole plan of god was actually built around you now that seems some people think that's contradictory but i want you to look at this for a moment god didn't say i'm going to do i'm going to ask something impossible and expect you to do it god said i'm going to take humanity who has created in my image and i'm going to make everything available to them what we see is weakness god just sees as part of the plan and as this comes a hold god designed this whole plan my brother and sister i'll just liken it to this right here god had a segment of his creation of redemption for the woman at the well and all like her he had it for the rich man he had it for the poor man he had it for the really smart man he had it for the very unintelligent as it were man so god built the whole plan around what we were going to be so that he could fulfill then that plan in our life specifically not just hey you happen to fit into this my brother and sister the plan of redemption was built specifically for you and i and we don't just as it were the round hole and square peg concept god made that plan of redemption to fit you and i perfectly oh if it's our if he did that for us perfectly how about we just perfectly trust him how about we just perfectly stand on that word and say lord let it come to pass in me hallelujah hallelujah now you know verse 9 he that covereth a transgression seeketh love but he that repeateth a matter separated very friends now this my brother and sister there are several different things quotes and and scriptures that we can look at this the scripture on one side let's look at it kind of you might say the negative side here if we hide one sin the scripture says we become a partaker of that sin amen but do you know the scriptures talking in that that a man who won't repent keeps coming and we would as it were shield everyone from their behavior actions and consequence scripture says then we're partaker of that but the scripture says if you see a brother taken in a fault let me just paraphrase it you don't go rebuke him degrade him shame him you actually cover him you actually shield him to lift him back up to his rightful position so we cover a transgression it's because we love them not because we want to hide their sin does that make sense do i explain that well enough you see the two differences some people hide sin in the church we we've known of situations where sin has been hidden covered up camouflaged in the church because we don't want the disruption but the person never repented what it does is ultimately because the scripture says whatever's done in secret will be made open but when you have someone with a repentant heart and they have a failure as it were in their life we don't broadcast it to the world we cover that up because there is repentance we want to restore them we don't want to shame them we want to restore them so you see the two sides of this amen that we would cover a transgression of a man a brother because we want to restore them to their rightful place amen and you look at this and and realize that these things are are very difficult sometimes things happen in people's lives the devil gets in there throws a stumbling stone and they get caught by that my brother and sister what we want them to do we want each one of us uh let's bring it back to ourselves we want to have a spirit of repentance we want to come and and not be shamed and and throwed out but we want to have a spirit of repentance and and that works kind of in two ways my brother and sister you see people can come and feel like well that church wasn't very kind to me but yet they themselves have something that they have held in their own heart there's a spirit about them there's a nature about them there's a behavior about them and they're not going to repent but they want everyone to overlook that for them no it's a two-way street amen right the prophet of god shows us clearly whatever we want in the house of god we must come in an attitude or a spirit to receive that hallelujah amen and reproof in earth more into a wise man than a hundred stripes into a fool the word of god says that we come to the house of god that's where correction begins so we recognize correction doesn't begin in the man called the pastor or the man called the deacon but correction starts in the word of god in the moving of the holy spirit and so the chastening doesn't come of man it comes of the word and my brother and sister we have to receive or hear the word to be corrected or chastened so when we won't listen when we close off to certain things then sometimes god is dealing with us and we just simply don't want to listen but you know what correction or chastening doesn't mean negative to a child of god it actually means positive i want to go down to verse 14. the beginning of strife is as when one letteth out water therefore leave off contention before it be meddled with now my brother and sister if you would understand what they're meaning here the beginning of strife is is when one lit without water you realize that when you go to let out water without having something to measure it in if if it's just simply running as it would be out of a culvert into a ditch there is no way to let just a little when you open the gate it flows now i say this humorous but i hope i hope you catch the deep meaning of it because it isn't always that we intend someone might say now brother paul what is the problem that you have with brother david well brother david and i don't really have a problem but i mean the other day it wasn't really a big deal but and i i really think he didn't mean bad by it but he well come on tell me what did he do well i shouldn't well it can't be that big a deal can it no really it's not the person walks away oh i thought maybe he just like tripped over your foot in the foyer we didn't really i hope you follow me saints we didn't really when we started out we didn't intend but when you start opening the gate it just comes out now don't lift your hands but because i want you to understand where i stand on this i've been guilty of that i never intended to say what i said or the amount of what i said but i said what i said when it was all done why because i opened the gate and next thing it was flowing and so contention comes out my brother in such a fashion and the word says you know what what i want you to do is to not let out any water at all don't let any contention come out at all the beginning of strife is as when one litteth out water therefore leave off contention you know how hard that is saints but i'm telling you right now can i be open with you tonight i'm telling you right now god help me i i just seems like sometimes these things happen and i just want to be able to come and take my gripes about you did i say that and i want to lay them down at an altar where it really matters you see because if i say something about you to you or you to you it doesn't change anything my brother and sister it just starts a contention and it starts to move through the church and sometimes these contentions can come from all kinds of things and pardon me for making a reference but it can be doctrine it can be ideologies it can be teachings that people have and this contention starts to move and pretty soon it's thrown to the whole building it's flow flowed through every life it's touching everyone and in the end we can say i really didn't mean for that to happen and be truthful in our heart but if we can come and say you know what i disagree with this i disagree with that i don't like what brother paul said i don't like what brother you know what my brother and sister if we'll lay it on the altar first and you do that you know you can correct your husband sisters from the altar brother you can correct your wives from the altar parents we can correct our children from the altar do you believe me it's it's scriptural of course the scripture also says spare the rod you spoil the child so there's times and places but see some people are drawn to what you might call contention some people are drawn to that some people need you know some people uh the older i get pardon for putting it back this way but the older i get the less drama i like in my life i just like you know i like this to happen and i like this to happen i like this to happen and if you say you're gonna do it please just do it i don't want it to be a big deal just do it if you can't do it you said you would do it and you can't do it just pick up a telephone and say i'm sorry i told you i don't know for an example i told you i would come and do this i can't come just pick the phone up don't make a drama out of it just say i am sorry i can't and then on the other end we don't make a drama out of it they promised well hallelujah the world doesn't revolve around me it doesn't revolve around you but the drama and some people love drama that's why the world has all kinds of drama shows having said that i read a little clip the other day on the computer that said that there is ample evidence that all the reality shows are false so what is it they've created a drama a little becomes a lot very quickly but i want to just put this as i try to hurry along here if we could focus this kind of energy that might come in all the contention whether it be within our marriages our families our church our workplace whatever you're talking about if we could focus our energies into the right channel in jude the first chapter verse 3 says you know what beloved when i gave all diligence to write unto you of the common salvation it was needful for me to write unto you and exhort you that you should earnestly contend for the faith which was once delivered unto the saints now my brother and sister do you understand the root word connection contention and content come right down to the same basic root word definition my look at that what is it to argue to assert to compete literally when there is contention there's competition it's really what it comes down to it might be ideas ideologies competing but what if we took and funneled all of those energies into the right channel and and we stood here as ministers as brothers and sisters in christ and we said you know all of this stuff that's going on around us the energy it would take me to to go and tell this person i disagree with you what if we channel that and we got down and said lord if i'm wrong correct me if he's wrong correct him what if we focus that in lord and maybe you know they're wrong you know sometimes that does happen we know without a shadow of a doubted individual is wrong in their position and what if we channel that energy instead of cornering them in the corner of the church and telling them you're wrong you're wrong wrong and i can prove it what if we channel that into earnestly contending and while we contend for the faith that was once delivered we can go ahead and reach out with a hand of faith and get a hold of our brother and sister and pull them into our prayer life pull them into the word through our own prayers i've seen god work that way i've seen god answer prayer i've seen lives completely turned in different directions over the prayers of a wife a grandmother grandfather a husband and channel that energy into that and say you know what i'm not gonna pardon me brother david but i'm not gonna contend with brother david i'm gonna contend for the faith that was once delivered to the saints and as i contend for that faith that was delivered to the saints it will be remarkable that brother david gets more spiritual come on look saints i'm not trying to be boastful but i know i'm telling the truth tonight i'm knowing that every time satan can divert our attention and our energy to some other form of some contention he didn't say what i want you to do is earnestly get in contention for the faith he said i want you to contend and my brother and sister when you look at the root of that scripture and the root of those things my brother and sister what it is is when you are contending for the gospel the faith that was once delivered to the saints you are looking to christ in christ alone and no other body no other person no other body of believers no other faction you're looking to christ in christ alone because you see only god can change the others it's probably good that we can't amen i'll skip over a little of this get a little carried away sometimes you know it goes right hand in hand with the sermon this thought and believe it or not the thought was there first but this is how hand in glove the quote fits to this brother branham is closing out a prayer may the lord add its blessings to that reading this is kind of an unusual text it's an unusual statement because we were asked to contend and yet the bible said there should not be contentions among us so very clearly stated right here in the the message that we should be contending without the contention god help us to put the contentions to the side i think they should this i want that that should have been this this should be come on let's forget the drama let's put our shoulder to the wheel and contend for the faith bible said there should not be contentious among us but we notice that not only to contend but to earnestly contend that is with great exuberance and energy contention is all right if it's for the right thing he said to earnestly contend for the faith that was once delivered unto the saints now you hear so say today oh divine healings against my faith the baptism of the holy spirit is against my faith there's only one faith and that faith doesn't come by joining church that faith comes by hearing and that of the word of god and we wrote so if we are so if we are bid to earnestly contend for the faith that was once delivered unto the saints the faith should not come out of a creed book but it should come out of god's bible for faith cannot rest upon the shifting sand of man's theology but it can only rest upon the eternal rock of god's unchangeable word that's the only place that faith can sufficiently rest you understand the words that he put right there we can put our faith in other things but it will never be sufficient no matter how much something else how real it looks how godly it looks it must come from the word of the living god look sometimes now look i don't want to sound offensive but more and more as time goes on we're hearing people little things like brother branham told so and so who told so and so who told me but this going back here won't fit come on remember i shared that it just comes to my mind i shared that deal sister ruth sharing about the puzzle she had that had color on both sides of the pieces so you could put the piece in that shape but it's not the right not right see so we got to have something where sufficiently rest no matter how much something else how real it looks how godly it looks it must come from the word of the living god because faith only comes by hearing and hearing of the word so there's many things that looks appealing to the eye i have often thought of seeing great shrines of the different religions and how beautiful they could be and i think of the temple of diana in the bible that it's claimed that it was more beautiful than the temple of solomon made out of marble and laid with gold for the goddess diana of ephesus i'll just pause for a moment the looks doesn't count now i don't want all you sisters coming to church this next sunday looking like you've been out doing chores okay i want you to come to church beautiful wear your nice clothes do your hair come with a smile on your face okay brothers we don't want to come in here with our just grubbies and you know the prophet of god said wear your best to church and you know come presentable come looking like you're happy to be here but looks doesn't count it's what god's word says there's a way that seemeth right unto a man so then faith could not rest upon looks then faith can only find its place in the word and we were asked to contend earnestly for the faith that was once delivered unto the saints and you realize my brother and sister the faith that was once delivered to the saints is right here contained in this book in the word in the holy ghost going back to my earlier thought it's been poured into you it's what's refining you it is not this church it is not some some certain group or some certain ministry or some certain activity it's the holy ghost in you that's doing the refining amen it's not well we were taught so well our pastor taught doctrine and all these things so well that won't give you the holy ghost that won't change your life it is the word which is christ in you there is what is changing us the nature change now we've just been sister jerry and i and in our interactions uh uh uh you know it's a it's a lovely thing uh and you know we come across this quote the other day this sister jerry actually shared it with me uh but i had just read it not that long ago uh where brother brown is dealing with that family and now he's talking about they were german and and uh and uh all this you know their ancestry and this young man had been converted but he hadn't received the holy ghost and the prophet of god says you know he ought not marry any girl pardon me for using these words but he says he'll make her life hell so the kid wasn't out in a bar room or a pool hall or running the streets at night he was going to church but he hadn't had a nature change young ladies well it goes both ways young people as the lord tarries and you get older you start looking for someone in your life don't look and say well that will change you don't marry them in fact you don't even hang out with them you know hold hands with them you know snuggling the car with them because without a nature change now when i'm talking about snuggling i'm not talking like the world's doing that i'm talking like you sit in the car touch shoulders you know going down the road you feel just that warm fuzzy feeling you married people should know what i'm talking about should don't go there the nature change comes first the new birth comes first that experience in christ and then you move on to happily ever after sometimes it's best to keep that inner voice inside we're asked to attend earnestly my brother and sister that's not half-heartedly that's not when it's available or it's easy an earnest contention is when you almost if you can i put in my words it's when you almost recklessly pursue well praise the lord if i get a promotion i'll know god loves me the devil will make sure you get bypassed come on we earnestly contend rich poor it's kind of like marriage vows right for richer for poorer sickness and in health for new house and furniture no earnestly contending i won't be satisfied without the faith that was delivered to the saints in pentecost i won't be satisfied until that same holy spirit comes down and i dwell in it each and every day my uh just so many things we could share but saints i just want you to catch this see all the way back in the proverbs not just 19th century 20th century 21st century all the way back in the proverbs it's showing us how this battle this race this great effort that is being afforded must be done with all of our might all with our ability not half-heartedly i should have went ahead and had brother alex put it but a little farther down in this quote i think it's beyond i think it was the 13th or 14th paragraph brother branham's talking about american why nothing is happening here is because the people are no longer hungry brother alex could you quickly find that amen the faith once delivered to the saints 5706 10 i believe it was 13 14 15 somewhere right there let's see i don't know go back the other way just a little bit well brother alex if you'll just look for it right there he's talking anyway if we don't if we don't see that right there i might have read further than i you know that was further than i thought but my brother and sister the prophet of god is saying the problem is we're not hungry that's right that's why god's not doing he says if we get hungry god will start acting upon it let's let's get hungrier saints can we do that i i'm not going to chastise nobody i'm just asking you from my heart let's get hungry or let's let's start putting a more earnestness in our contending and you say well brother paul i'm full-blown contending praise the lord pray for me pray for me got a lot of distractions in my life pray for me amen now look i want to just close out with this right here proverbs 15th verse he that justifieth the wicked and he that condemneth the just even they both are abomination to the lord now i want you to see the continuity as we would go backwards into proverbs the sixth chapter and we would look right here and we will see what the scripture says 6-16 these six things that the lord hate yea seven are an abomination unto him a proud look a lying tongue hands that shed innocent blood a heart that devises wicked imaginations feet be swift in running to mischief a false witness that speaketh lie and he that soweth discord among the brethren amen now i'm going to take this and if you don't mind i'm going to just focus on this last verse for just a moment sister emmy if you'll come you see my brother and sister he that saw a discord among his brethren would be one that would intentionally come and bring contention into the body of believers intentionally knowing that what he's saying knowing what he's doing is going to cause problems god said that's an abomination god forgive us when we innocently cause problems you know forgive us lord when we innocently say or do something that causes a problem but look at the kind of spirit that would be upon a man to know as it would be i can come and i can drive a wedge between brother trevor sister carrie or brother trevor and brother david or or whoever it might be i can drive a wedge in there god says i hate that that makes me sick oh my brother and sister god forgive us for our innocent mistakes and lord protect us from any spirit that would cause us to come with a contentious spirit into the house of god let us come already my brother and sister uh uh surrendered already come subjected to the word of god come into the house of god into the body of believers already you know what is real you know what is real courage i read this and i won't have the words writing but i read this recently said real courage is a man who comes up with his name and tell him thank you when it's finished wow i can sit down and interact and not have to start a fight and can get up and say thank you let us be those kind of christians let us just take these words from the book of proverbs and let them come down and rest in our heart i believe god laid them for us to to realize these little nuggets as we go along we get to pick them up as we go along and realize you know what and and here again saints i'm sorry to say i've been guilty of venting frustrations at times and saying well if they had done this you know what i've done i've thrown out every ingredient there is for a contention when i've taken that to people instead of christ when we take that as it were to the church and not the pastor you know what i'm saying sometimes even we can take it to a friend my wife what are we doing we're creating the ingredient for contention my husband the ingredient for contention how about lord i just know i just know my husband is wrong lord but i'll just leave it to you lord to change it [Music] you know sometimes god just lets these things happen it ain't about the trial it's about what you and i are going to do with it lord help us to pass the test help us lord that the refiners fire as it refines our hearts brings us pure and pure into righteousness not of the things that buffeted by this earth [Music] not by the things of this earth my brother and sister but moved by the holy spirit because you see if we're moved by the things of this earth we actually will just simply get blown off course but when we allow the holy spirit to come down we'll find those around us even though they might do us wrong we can find ourselves fulfilling the word of god that we can love our enemies have you ever thought how hard that is come on saints honest some of you are more passionate some people are just smile not your head go on some of us are more passionate well i can remember this happened oh really when did that happen it happened on may the 13th 1984 might be time to let go of that you see we want to be able to love our enemy [Music] it's got to start somewhere doesn't it we're fixing to start planting you know seeds saints all we're putting in the ground right now is a seed i spent all winter fixing the harvester that's wonderful we've spent years preaching about the rapture [Music] but we got to get the right seed to produce the right result that there would be a rapture that we'd have something to be harvested i just prayed tonight just from the depths of my heart as i read these scriptures i just saw god dealing with me little things i'll be transparent when the trouble went through this church i felt so gut-punched i i wanted to revert back to some wild teenager and just go assault somebody now we can laugh about that saints but it was a feeling i felt betrayed [Music] but out of all of that god said look this is your part how do you feel about your part you know what i had to do had to repent over my part [Music] but ultimately i don't want contention i want to see a group of people each and every one of us as it were shoulder to shoulder saints each one of you i trust you how much i love you so i'm not doing from human emotion but from my heart how i love you as brothers and sisters in christ and i want to see us shoulder to shoulder each one contending all contention left behind us simply contending for the cross simply contending for the faith that was given to us hallelujah oh my what is that song sister [Music] brother jay made a comment he said i might have to leave for a minute paul but i'll be back to rescue you look who shows up hallelujah hallelujah

portion of that i choose i choose to be holy i'm telling you saints it's not within us in our flesh to make that choice it's nothing less than almighty god coming down dropping the flux into our hearts and purifying that we can stand and say lord this is what i want to be i want to be righteous i want to be holy lord and lord we thank you tonight for that from the depths of our heart i lift my hands in my voice and say thank you lord for dropping the flux of your word your holy spirit right down into us creating a desire in us lord jesus that we want to serve you we want to pour out our
