Um we want to remember uh brother Paul's asking please pray for Mike Margarite uh last few days it he had a sore on his leg that has turned into an inflamed sore that now requires surgery. Um if I remember he's a friend of Joel's and and brother Paul's met the man. Amen. So I just want to pray for him. I don't know where his situation is, but also pray for Lord to save his soul. Amen. I don't know what, but um also remember pray for my uh nephew Matthew. He's going through a going through a time, you know, those teenage years can be tough on a kid and he's having a tough time of it. So Lord, just just pray, you know, Lord, just speak to his heart and point him in the right direction. Amen. Um, I'll just continue to remember my sister Elizabeth or cousin Elizabeth sister sister cousin, you know what I mean? Um, in prayer as well. She I can't remember the last report, but uh she was having some more treatments and they were um she had some low blood levels. So, just continue to hold her up in prayer. Amen. Also wanted to just give a praise report. mom was when they were in Wyoming this last week. She was not I mean pretty bad off and thought she'd have to go to the hospital um maybe that night, but um we prayed and she woke up in the morning and just said it was miraculous how much better she felt. So the Lord is still working. Amen. We give him thanks for that. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Yes. I just went happening so quick [Music] oaks that pray, but I need prayer. And uh so we just want to remember remember that. And that opened the door for a lovely &gt;&gt; Yes. And that opened the door for a lovely conversation with my son. Amen. So, we thank the Lord for that. Amen. And uh so just want to remember all of our normal prayer requests. I know we uh talk about them a lot, but um those up north and Montana, Washington, Idaho, uh just remember each and every one. I was thinking about Daniel last few days. Haven't seen him for a bit. And uh we just want to lift him up before the Lord and certainly every one of our children in their situations. Amen. Heavenly Father, Lord, we come before you this evening with thanksgiving in our hearts, Lord, for we stand just as our brother Isaac said. Father, we don't have to feel it. We don't have to have any kind of external stimulation. Lord, you said it. We believe it and father it will come to pass. And father, we want to stand here in faith, Lord, knowing with expectation that these things will come to pass and that the very life that you have spoken, Lord, would be there, that we would reach out and claim it, Lord, not to let doubt and fear, anxiety rob us of our victory, but Lord, that today we can just simply steadfastly stand upon your word. So we remember Mike, Lord, today. He's got young children. Father, we just ask you, Lord. Lord, he has met some people who have prayer. And Father, we just lift him up before you. May this be a door, Lord, that would be open to his soul, Lord, that he would not have to look for others that pray, but Lord, may you just stimulate a prayer life in him. Lord, we pray for him, his wife, his children. May they find salvation, find you in this situation. And Father, we pray for Matthew. Lord, a young man in a troubled time, a troubled age that we live in, a young man, Father, needs to find an anchor in his life, an absolute. And we just ask you to come, Father, and just settle that question for him, Lord, that he would be able to then go on with confidence to live all the days of his life knowing who he is in you. Lord, we just lift up every prayer request. Father, those that are overseas, our sister Toma, uh, Brother Vasilei on the road, Brother Sergey, sister Julia, Father, uh, soon to return from their family vacation, Lord, uh, each and every one, Father, we just lift up before you, Father, just to touch, Lord, every life in the way, Father, that you would just love to touch us, Lord. For we know the prophet told us that you you desire to heal us more than we want healing. You desire to save us more than we want to be saved. You desire to do all of these things, Lord, more than we even know how to ask. And Father, we just want to reach out in faith and claim each need, Father, each situation. And Lord, we just want to come and ask you tonight, Father, for more opening of your word, more revelation, Father, that you would give to your bride. For, Father, the season is now that you are fulfilling your word. And we see that. And Lord, we just long, Father, for more of you. Ask you to move in our midst tonight. Use our brother to speak to our needs spiritually, Lord. That it would encourage each and every one of us. Lord, we thank you for your grace, for your mercy, your kindness upon us, Lord, as every believer, Father, in the realm that we have influence, Lord, would just be blessed and come closer to you.

[Music] Oh, give thanks. Thank you, Lord. Praise the Lord. If we could stand for just a moment as we approach the scripture. I'm grateful to be here tonight. Thank you, brother Paul. and uh we just had a kind of had a vacation. We've been off for a few weeks and he asked, "Well, would you speak tomorrow night?" And I said, "Wow, if I remember how fortunately, it's not up to me. It's up to God." So, and all I have to do is let go and let God. So, that's the nice part. &gt;&gt; But, uh happy to be here. And for all the people out there online, I don't know if I got this little thing on you. change deals and it's still red. How do I turn it on? Well, I know I know how to use this one if we have to. all the, you know, the modern stuff and then we go just calling as it is we get and I was looking here at this notebook where we try to keep some kind of order to notes and and I feel sorry sometimes for guys that they don't get out that much because if you're not real busy but you're always gathering notes and things and then it's that thing where you want to give them the whole bail and at least in in what I do. So sometimes I know brother David I look at him and I go I feel for you brother David. I really do because at least you know I go to Nicaragua. I spoke I think uh 11 times in 12 days so I can just start through the notes and uh uh it's very helpful sometimes and but we're just thankful to the Lord for what he does for us and um we have somebody was asking well where's your next trip and [Applause] I don't know to be real honest the ones that have been coming back the most to us we hear from India every week. We hear from Chile about every other week or third week. And not to mention El Salvador, Nicaragua, Panama. I heard possible for Brazil recently. Uh Italy has several times and I just go, Lord, I don't have a clue. If it's not you, if it's not you leading and you providing for it, then it's just &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; They're just little electronic digits. That's all. So, we just praise the Lord for that and do pray for us. We covet your prayers. And uh I was telling somebody just recently, you know, because they were like, "Well, why would you want me to pray for And I said, because when you look at Exodus, God told Moses, "I heard the cry of my people." &gt;&gt; Moses wasn't crying out to God. &gt;&gt; He was just a happy sheep farmer. And but God said, "No, Moses, you're going down there because I heard their voice." So do pray for us and pray for some of these people in these other countries there. It is a famine &gt;&gt; for the hearing the word of the god. Word of God worldwide. And so we just praise the Lord. Happy to be here tonight. Happy for each one of you and all those that out in electronic land. Let's turn first to uh second Timothy the the uh second chapter. Happy to have my wife with us here tonight. She has her struggles with and I know I've said I probably maybe didn't say it here, but because she's had the colon surgery and stuff, the kids call her our mom the semicolon. And uh so she has her struggles. But I'm happy to have you here tonight, darling. So, uh, well, here we go. Going the wrong direction, still working this this we got this new Bible. It's been about a half a year ago or so. A little more. No, a little more than that now. But, uh, I still, you know, you go through and you start marking things and I still don't know where everything at is in this new one. And the other one I thought, well, I'll use it. And you open it up and the pages are falling out. So that don't work either. But second Timothy in chapter 2 and verse 8, he said uh we'll start with verse 7. Consider what I say and the Lord give thee understanding in all things. Remember that Jesus Christ of the seed of David was raised up from the dead according to my gospel. And then if we could turn also uh to Ephesians the first chapter and there we'll read a little longer portion. We'll start about verse I think it's 17 uh well we'll start 16. cease not to give thanks for you, making mention you of you in our prayers, that the God of our Lord Jesus Christ, the Father of glory, may give unto you the spirit of wisdom and revelation in the knowledge of him. the eyes of your understanding be enlightened that ye may know what is the hope of his calling that the riches of the glory of his inheritance in the saints and what is the exceedingness exceeding greatness of his power to usward who believe according to the working of his mighty power which he wrought in Christ when he raised him from the dead and set him on his own right hand in heavenly places far above all principality power might and dominion ion and every name that is named not only in this world but also in that which is to come. Gracious heavenly father, we've read your word tonight. I ask you Lord just get this man out of the way and let the spirit of God that you placed within it speak to the hearts of your people in Jesus' name. Amen. Please be seated. as we look at it at at that first scripture that we read from second Timothy and how it appears is kind of a strange verse in some respects because we think well Jesus Christ was raised up uh you know at the resurrection and we read about you know through Matthew, Mark, Luke and John and each one has their uh description of the resurrection and what happened at the resurrection and after the resurrection and how that the the power of God as we think about it. But nobody really even in those gospels really explains as to what brought that resurrection power to pass. And here we see in Timothy when uh Paul is speaking here to to Timothy and he says remember that Jesus Christ of the seed of David was raised from the dead according to my gospel. Now as we think and we know in this the end of Timothy when it talks about every scripture has compound meaning and compound revelation. And as we look at this and we and and we take a close exam or I take a close examination of this, it said that Jesus Christ, he's of the seed of David. Well, what is the the seed of David? So, we start thinking about Jesus Christ is being raised from the dead. And he said it's according to my gospel, but this came from the seed of David. Well, so we go back and and we covered this, I think, a few a while back when we were here and we spoke about uh how that David was used and how that when he was first called and we we'll just read that first. It's in 1st Samuel chapter 16 and how we took that when God became uh took showed kingship through David. But it starts out there in 1st Samuel 6 first. I'm sorry. I have a broken tooth. So, I'm talking funny because I try to keep my tongue off of that tooth because it scratches it. So, if I'm talking funny, it's not that I'm just be merciful to me. Praise the Lord. And the Lord said unto Samuel, "How long wil thou mourn for Saul, seeing I have rejected him from reigning over Israel? Fill thy horn with oil, and go, and I will send thee to Jesse the Bethleamite, for I have provided me a king among his sons." And he continues there and and in verse the ne in verse three he says and call Jesse to the sacrifice show thee what thou shalt do and thou shalt anoint unto me uh whom I name unto thee. And so we look at this and he when Paul speaks this in Timothy he said that Jesus Christ was raised from the dead. He's he's of the seed of David and he's raised from the dead according to and then Paul says my gospel and if we think about this as okay the seed of David what is the seed of David we started out and the Lord speaks to Samuel. So if we were to turn as it were to John the first chapter it says in the beginning was the word the word was with God and the word was God. And so we see when it says the Lord or that God is speaking to Samuel and Samuel I believe is the first man that's mentioned in the scripture that it says that God was revealed to Samuel by the word of the Lord. There were other prophets other they had visions. They had all different kinds of ways that God dealt with them. But God that Samuel was the first one that it said that he was he that God was revealed to Samuel by the word. So here the word of the Lord comes to or the Lord the word comes to Samuel. So Samuel is beginning to understand and perceive that the word of God or God the word is here and he's speaking to me. And as he speaks to him, he gives him certain instructions. And those instructions were to go and anoint me and that me is God himself to be king. So God is telling Samuel, I'm going to show myself as a king and whoever I anoint. And then he tells him, go down to Jesse the Bethleamite. And we went over that how the Jesse means where I ex means I exist. And he exists where? In Bethlehem, the house of God's bread. So immediately we begin to see the word of God coming from the presence of God and and putting the seed of God. You know we look at it as words on pages but that behind that seed there is a power of God a power of creation that goes back to the very personality of God. In the very beginning of the book it says in the beginning God created. So we see that is God's way of demonstrating himself into these realms that we live in. And so when he speaks to Samuel, he is going forth now an he's giving that power of creation into his prophet Samuel by his word. &gt;&gt; And so Timothy says he was raised up. He he that Jesus Christ he said remember this Jesus Christ was raised up. He's of the seed of David. So what is the seed of David? It is the word of God. &gt;&gt; It is the power of creation behind the word of God. &gt;&gt; And so that prophet goes down. He goes to where God exists. Go to where I exist and that is in the house of my bread. Jesus said, "I am the bread of life." And so we see the power of creation has come and begins to demonstrate this seed of David that brought forth Jesus Christ. And here Paul said, "And he was raised from the dead according to my gospel by the seed of David." Are you with me? Okay. So as we look at that in a little deeper thought or with a little more depth and how that we thinking that each scripture or every scripture has compound meaning and compound revelation and he says there that he was ra let me let me get turn back to it so I'm quoting it correctly. We uh today kind of started off with a wow wild day. Phone calls, visitors, whatever. It was just kind of an amazing day. But and I just said at one point because I had three phone calls I think in a row and I'm looking at I'm going, Lord, I know this is just the enemy trying to get me goofed up. So, praise the Lord. And remember that Jesus Christ of the seed of David was raised from the dead according to my gospel. So as we think of Jesus Christ was raised from the dead. He was of the seed of David. Well, we look at other things in the life of David and we can see those seed. The seed that came through that prophet is now being expressed. We know when he went to and faced Goliath here was Goliath and he had the sword. And I remember a little further in there when David goes down to I believe it's a Himlec and said, "Do you have any weapons here in the church?" And a Hima says, "Well, I I yeah, I just got one." And and well, what is it? And it's the sword of Goliath, which you took from the valley of El. And David said, "Give it to me. There's no sword like that sword." Now remember, we're talking about this is the seed of David coming through history. Goliath held that sword. How did Goliath get that sword? Well, and why were all of those men afraid of Goliath? We know he represents Satan, of course, because David stood up against him and said, "Why do you let this happen? Why is he even allowed to uh speak against the armies of Israel? How did it did and how did Goliath get that sword? And and what was the seed that we're talking about that's going to come forth later on? Because David now is representing God as king. And when he goes and faces that giant, how did Goliath get the sword? And why were those men so afraid? In the book of Hebrews, the 2 chapter, it said that well, let's read it. It's just a few pages away for as much. And this is Hebrews 2:12. This is to show you why these people were afraid and why we were part of and have been part of this fear and yet we shouldn't be now. For as much then as the children are partakers of flesh and blood, he also likewise talking about Jesus Christ, took part of the same, that through death he might destroy him that had the power of death. That is the devil. Through death he would destroy the power of death. And that's the devil because he held the power of death. Goliath represented the power of death by holding that sword. And he's saying that uh and that that is the devil and deliver them who through the fear of death &gt;&gt; were all their lifetimes subject to bondage. What was holding them? Who held the sword? Was Satan? David said there's no sword like that sword because that sword represented the word of God in the hands of Satan. And how did Satan get that sword? Because when he spoke to Eve, she was the one in the transgression. You can read that in Timothy also. And how that she fell and and when she did that, because the word of God said, "In the day you eat thereof, ye shall surely die." That was the word of the Lord. That was God's word concerning their partaking of that particular tree, which we know it was sensual. I'll use that word. And how that when they did that, Satan was able to put the fear of death on them right there. &gt;&gt; Right? &gt;&gt; They became afraid of the word of God. They became afraid because they knew they had fallen into disobedience. &gt;&gt; There it is. &gt;&gt; So, we're talking about the seed of David. We know that God in David as an anointed king and he wasn't he was he was anointed king but he wasn't king yet. He was still out in the shepherd's field doing his thing because God is our shepherd. But he goes and when he slays that giant and he takes that sword away from him, what's the one thing he did with the sword? He didn't have a sword of his own. He picked up Goliath's sword and chops his head off. &gt;&gt; Satan's headship is finished &gt;&gt; by the sword &gt;&gt; of God's word. headship done, finished. Stop talking about him. &gt;&gt; He's dead. &gt;&gt; Just saying what the word says. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; That devil is dead. And yet he runs people around. He does it. All of us, I suppose. And but we forget he's dead. &gt;&gt; That's right. That's right. &gt;&gt; That That guy's dead, man. And how did they cut his head off? Right here. Amen. &gt;&gt; The seed of David. And so he's talking about that seed coming through there and how that they were afraid, but Jesus Christ took death himself to take the fear away. And let's I wasn't going to do this, but I it's come to my mind a couple of times in Genesis that's Genesis that chap first I think it's third chapter. as they have fallen uh and it's when God comes to them. We'll start with verse 7 is it's chapter 3:7. And the eyes of them both were opened and they knew that they were naked and they sewed the fig leaves together and made themselves apron and they heard the voice of the Lord God walking in the garden. What's the voice of the Lord? It's the word, friends. It's the word, the agape or the the love of God, the word of God, the logos speaking to them, excuse me. And uh they heard the voice of the Lord God walking in the garden in the cool of the day. And Adam and his wife hid themselves from the presence of the Lord God amongst the trees of the garden. What had happened? Satan had begun to anoint them with his anointing because when God when the voice the logos voice of God comes walking in the garden and it says the Lord God called unto Adam and said unto him where art thou Adam or where art thou and he and Adam answers and said I heard thy voice in the garden and I was afraid because I was naked and I hid myself. What happened here? He's a son of God. He even knew what he was doing. &gt;&gt; He knew what he was doing. &gt;&gt; And he took her and we realize he did it because he loved her because she was part &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; of him. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; But the voice of the Lord or the word of God had said, "The day you do that, you'll die." So the judgment against the disobedience as it were was the death shall be a part of your your life from here on and by that word of the Lord. But when Satan by had got a hold of that word now through disobedience and he's holding every man, woman, and child captive to fear from this day on because Adam said, "I was afraid." &gt;&gt; Yeah. So God and it's a whole different message but actually when you take where it says the voice of the Lord there it's you look at all the things that were in the voice God came to them in absolute mercy and grace and they hid themselves from the grace and mercy of God &gt;&gt; and they and because they hid themselves he said I heard thy voice. He heard the mercy, the grace, the blood, and and all there's there's a whole list of definitions that go behind that voice of the Lord. And he heard that and was afraid. And so God asked him these questions, but then God has him to stand up and they go into judgment because they turned down the mercy. Wow. Lord, please take over. I was afraid. I hid myself because I was naked. And he said, "Who told thee?" And so forth. And then the Lord, you know, asked the woman, "What happened?" And she said, "The and right immediately after that, what happens is God begins to give judgment on the situation. Serpent, you're going on your belly. Eve, every woman from here on is going to have trouble in their childbirth. because of what you did. It's not so much to me the fact that they committed the act as it is the fact that they became afraid of the grace and mercy of God. &gt;&gt; Right? &gt;&gt; When mercy came to them through the voice of God and they hid themselves. And we see that seed goes all the way through history because when it comes to Isaiah, it says we hid ourselves from him. Every man, woman, and child, when we feel the judgment of God or we think about the situation of mankind, we become afraid. And he said through the seed of David going back to Timothy and he was we think about the other things that happened within the life of David and in the Psalms there's so so many things where when David speaks things in the Psalms and and I think it's uh it's I don't believe it's 19. I forgot which one it was. I got it written down in a different notebook. The different places where it said, "Thou wil not leave his soul in hell, nor suffer my holy one to see corruption." And how that what was that? David spoke it, but what was it? It was a seed from God that came through the life of David as God was showing himself as king. &gt;&gt; Amen. And from that seed, he said, Paul says, remember that Jesus Christ of the seed of David because David was the manifestation of the seed that came from God through that prophet to be manifested through history and show up as Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; Amen. Jesus also talked about then how that uh when they ask him for a sign and and we ministered on this a while back uh with Jonah and Jesus says the only sign you're going to get is the sign of the prophet Jonah and how that that in that seed was the power of the resurrection and that that seed was manifested And that seed came down through Jesus Christ. But time after time, things that happened in the life of David showed us Christ. &gt;&gt; Amen. That's right. &gt;&gt; And the the the beginning of Christ. And and even we mentioned to him and how David said there's no sword like that sword. And remember that sword was wrapped in swaddling cloth. It was wrapped in swaddling cloth and it was behind the altar. And I think before we, you know, we hung the coat on the front and be and that because that was the ephod of the priest hung on the front of the altar. The yuroman was on there, but the sword was in the heart of the altar. And he said, "There's no sword like that sword. Give it to me." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; David was a man after God's own heart. And when the high priest hands David the sword, what did he just give him? &gt;&gt; Amen. the heart of God. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Because the heart of God is the word of God. And how did the word appear? He had to unwrap the sword &gt;&gt; and the sword, the word of God. And the angel came to those shepherds and said, "Behold, is born this day a Savior, which is Christ the Lord. And this will be a sign unto you. You shall find the babe, the heart of God wrapped in swaddling cloth, lying in a manger where? In Bethlehem? In the house of my bread. God's bread is where my heart lies. You love him. Yes. &gt;&gt; And so we see time after time that seed of David manifested in Christ over and over and over. So much so and uh when David after David fell where we look at it as he fell and had taken Ba Sheeba and he falls under the curses also. And cuz you know the prophet said, "David, you're not surely going to die. You're not going to die, David." David had pronounced his own judgment. He was the highest voice or highest authority of the land. And what the king says is what's supposed to happen. And he said, "Let that man die." &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; He should have died &gt;&gt; under his own commandment. But that prophet stepped forth. And have we ever noticed he used the same words that Satan did? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Satan said, "You'll not surely die." And that prophet said, "You'll not die, David. Even though you did this, you'll not die." And we but the but what happened the fear of death even on him as king now because can you imagine what went through his mind when he realizes when the prophet said that guy was you David he has just condemned himself to death &gt;&gt; his guards or whatever could have took their swords right there and killed him and had every right to do it &gt;&gt; because that's how kings work. Amen. &gt;&gt; And but then that voice comes back and he brings to remembrance the words from the garden. And when God used that voice, no, death has been abolished. &gt;&gt; David, you already cut the head off and you have the sword in your hand. &gt;&gt; Amen. But we see then all those curses that fell upon David. And so he gets thrown out of his kingdom and as he's going out of his kingdom and he goes up the hill and he stops and he weeps on a on a rock and we see that and then he goes on from there and we see that I believe it was about 600 years later here's Jesus Christ thrown out of his kingdom because the Bible said that he came to his own and his own received him not. &gt;&gt; Right? So, he's been thrown out of his kingdom and he's going up perhaps the same hill, perhaps the same rock. And he stops to weep over Jerusalem. And as he weeps over Jerusalem, Jesus says, "Jerusalem, Jerusalem, how often would I have gathered you, but you would not." &gt;&gt; What drove David to that rock? &gt;&gt; It was the sin of adultery. What took Jesus to that same rock? Adultery in the Garden of Eden. That's &gt;&gt; right. &gt;&gt; You see the seed of David coming through over and over and over. But then he comes down. I don't there as he looks at it. Paul making that particular statement and he said remember that Jesus Christ of the seed of David. So we've established Jesus Christ has the seed of David over and over and over manifested through Jesus Christ. He said remember this that Jesus Christ was of the sa seed of David and he was raised from the dead according to my gospel. Hm. Paul wasn't even on the scene yet when Jesus Christ was raised from the dead. &gt;&gt; So, how and why would he be relaying it to us this way from this scripture? He wasn't alive. He even said so. I was born out of season. I wasn't with the original 12. I'm we'd call it, you know, the odd duck or or whatever. And so, he wasn't even there. But he's saying that that seed of David that he was raised according to my gospel. Well, you know, in the English language, we can say, well, he's just relating back to it. Well, if we just relate back to it, we're taking on a denominational spirit because it always looks back and it always looks ahead and ignores what's going on right &gt;&gt; now. And so in the right now when Paul speaks this to Timothy, &gt;&gt; he's saying that the seed of David has brought forth the you know the resurrection of Jesus Christ according to my gospel. So he's saying the gospel that's being preached right now &gt;&gt; has the power of resurrection in it &gt;&gt; according to the seed of David that was in or brought forth Jesus Christ &gt;&gt; the power of the resurrection. Thank you brother David. We we work we work together I believe. And so that power of resurrection you too brother Paul he's say saying that the power of the resurrection is in the gospel that's being preached right &gt;&gt; now. We are delving or going in tonight to the same gospel &gt;&gt; that brought Jesus Christ from the dead that Paul could look back and say what I'm preaching is the same thing that brought Jesus Christ from the dead. &gt;&gt; And that was according to the seed of David which is the word of God. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. That's right. So we see the power of resurrection is in the word of God. &gt;&gt; So why would Paul be relating this to Timothy? Well, Timothy's going out among all the Gentiles and as you read through there and he's, you know, he's with those other apostles and God has now turned away from the Jews or is in the process of turning away. It wasn't an instantaneous thing, but uh and as so he's telling these Gentiles, the power of resurrection comes to us by way of the seed of David according to what I'm preaching, according to my gospel. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Why would that be important? And we get look again. We go back to Jesus Christ. And when the Gentiles came to Jesus Christ, sir, we would see Jesus. You've heard the tape. &gt;&gt; Sir, we would see Jesus. Jesus didn't even go talk to them. &gt;&gt; No, that's right. &gt;&gt; He did not even give those guys a chance. I I &gt;&gt; No, he just told I believe it was the disciples, just go back and tell them except a corn and wheat fall in the ground and die, it abides alone. What was he telling them? Gentiles, you're going to go through the same thing that I'm about to go through because now it's going to change from Jesus Christ the man into Jesus Christ the church. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; When it goes to the Gentiles, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; And he's telling them, Gentiles, this is not your season. That's &gt;&gt; right. &gt;&gt; This season is for the Jews because this is their three and a half years. you'll get your time. Go back and look for that seed and that resurrection power because it wasn't until after the resurrection the Gentiles could even have any comprehension of receiving Jesus Christ. Prophet of God said we were the ones wandering around with a club on our back. We weren't looking for a Messiah. &gt;&gt; We were looking for kingdoms. Babylon and Assyria and Egypt and Rome and Greece and we were only worry our only concern was worldly kingdoms and Jesus said accepted corn wheat falls in the ground and dies. So why is Paul saying this in to Timothy? Because the power of the resurrection for the gentile church is in the word that we speak. the power of the seed of David that raised up Jesus Christ from the dead according to the gospel of Paul. According to the gospel that we preach &gt;&gt; right now has the power of resurrection in it. &gt;&gt; Amen. When they when Jesus went to the tomb of Lazarus, what did he say? And Martha came out. Oh, if you'd have been here, my brother would not be dead. You know, wouldn't have died. And and Jesus said, I am. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; The resurrection. So, who is the I am? &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; I am the resurrection. Well, what came to Samuel? The I am. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Because it was the same God only in the form of the word. Amen. &gt;&gt; Came to Samuel. Came to Moses in vision and in other however ways different ways that he dealt with Moses. But to Samuel, God was revealed to him by the word. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And he's saying by the word, the I am &gt;&gt; Y &gt;&gt; the resurrection. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; The power of the resurrection. It's not something. Yeah, there will be a resurrection. as far as you know an event that happens, &gt;&gt; but it'll happen according to the word. &gt;&gt; Amen. That's it. &gt;&gt; It's not going to happen by somebody's denominational idea. Sorry friends, forget it. It's not going to happen. It's just not going to be there. You know, you see, I've seen these pictures and you know, the Mormons, they have a certain way that they Oh, they're neat pictures. And the I believe it's the Seventh Day Adventist, you know, they have all these graves with people standing there and they look like little gophers or something. And no, &gt;&gt; no, friends, that's not it at all. &gt;&gt; We are stepping from this dimension into another dimension. That's right. &gt;&gt; And the power to do that is right here revealed &gt;&gt; from this book. &gt;&gt; Amen. by the preaching of a man called Paul whom a prophet in this day said I preached what Paul preached. So where is the power of the resurrection? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And he also you know to continue that he said and I am the life. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; He that was alive shall never die. And what was the only thing the only requirement? You believe it. Yeah. &gt;&gt; Do we believe that the power of God is in this book that we preach? &gt;&gt; Do we honestly believe? We've we've heard pray for revelation. You need it more than anything you can ever imagine. &gt;&gt; Amen. And how we read there um in Ephesians, how that boy was chapter one. He says that the God of our Lord Jesus Christ and the father of glory may give unto you the spirit of wisdom and revelation in the knowledge of him &gt;&gt; that your eyes of understanding might be enlightened that you might know what is the hope of his calling and the riches of his glory of his inheritance in the saints. What is the exceeding greatness of his power to us? Amen. &gt;&gt; His power to us word what &gt;&gt; to believe. &gt;&gt; His power to us word who believe. &gt;&gt; I believe this gospel. &gt;&gt; I believe the power of God &gt;&gt; is in the foolishness of preaching. Amen. &gt;&gt; I believe that what Paul said, he knew what he was talking about &gt;&gt; because the gentile church was going to have to go through the exact same thing because it was the seed of Jesus Christ that brought forth the gentile church. That's why the church had to go out and had to die and then begins to come forth stage after stage coming forth coming forth unto what we call the headstone or the capstone. &gt;&gt; Amen. That's exactly right. &gt;&gt; Capstone's not actually in the scripture. It's headstone. And when you look it up, it's a feminine word. &gt;&gt; That's right. Amen. That's exactly right. &gt;&gt; Because in the in the language of the Hebrew, there's masculine words. There's feminine words. The headstone is a feminine word. Friends, &gt;&gt; the bride is the headstone, &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; of Christ being revealed. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; By his power working in us that believe. Amen. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; It's the power of God being revealed in what we call the bride of Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; Right. Amen. &gt;&gt; Oh my fair one, come away. It says in &gt;&gt; Song of Solomon. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; Why hideest thou in the cliffs of the rock? Come, my fair one. What causes that dove to come is the voice. the voice of my beloved &gt;&gt; and he says, "Come away. Come away." The same voice that brought Jesus Christ on the scene through this by way of the seed of the life of David &gt;&gt; is the same voice that will call us away as we believe according to this book &gt;&gt; and according to the spirit of God upon us. And he continues there which we which he wrought in Christ when he raised him from the dead and set him at his own right hand in heavenly places. He showed this the revelation of God in Christ is now the revelation of Christ in the bride. &gt;&gt; That's right. Amen. That's right. The same revelation that res or brought Jesus Christ from the dead is the same revelation that will bring us from the dead because of Jesus Christ in us. Christ in you, &gt;&gt; Christ in me, Christ in us, &gt;&gt; the hope of glory. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. So he mentions there the power and I I wanted to read uh second Timothy first chapter because he said a very interesting thing going into there and that is in starting there he uses that word in verse in chap in number six there. Wherefore I put thee in remembrance that thou stir up the gift of God which is in thee. Here he says by the putting on of my hands. For God hath not given us the spirit of fear. &gt;&gt; He didn't give you a spirit of fear. &gt;&gt; We read that Jesus Christ took death. He paid for death. Death fell on Jesus Christ that the sons and daughters of God do not have to go through fear. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Of death. I felt the fear of death before. And it's I shook like a leaf. Should have been, you know, according to what you think of as natural science, I should have been dead. &gt;&gt; But God stepped in and took away that fear for a split second. And I walked away as though nothing happened. He did it in front of witnesses. &gt;&gt; Three men saw it happen and they said, "You should be dead. Should have been a log hit me. I should have been like a bug on a windshield, man. Should have been done." But he said he didn't give you a spirit of fear. &gt;&gt; But &gt;&gt; and they say that in the language of English, English language, that the word but means that it pretty much, you know, neglects the things that's before it. So that spirit of death, you don't even we don't have to even think about it. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Because what he gave us is a spirit of power &gt;&gt; and love &gt;&gt; and a sound mind. We read in in Ephesians here, I want you to have a revelation of God in your minds so you understand what's going on. Yeah. &gt;&gt; And so he's saying and and so God gave us a spirit not of fear but of power &gt;&gt; and of love and of a sound mind. And as we look at just the simple definitions there uh the word power there is uh in and a sound mind it actually means to be able to control your spirit of feelings is one of the definitions. And I hate to say this, but I see it overseas a lot. And there's guys, they come out and they preach these big, you know, the the Bible says in another place, great swelling words and, you know, and the people, they run to the altar and they have their prayer lines and they do what they do. &gt;&gt; But that's not the point, &gt;&gt; right? That's it. I could care less about a prayer line than I care about the person that came in one way and when they walked out that door, their life was totally changed and they'll never be again the same again. &gt;&gt; That's exactly right. &gt;&gt; Because the power of God came into them and by the love of God and changed their mind. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. That's right. &gt;&gt; Brother Brandham said, "What is repentance?" It's the changing of the mind. &gt;&gt; Amen. When Peter said repent and be baptized in the name of Jesus Christ, he's saying change your mind and come and get immersed into Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; And that's enough to change because that's the love of God being expressed. And when you walk out those doors, if your life is changed, I'll know the love of God has touched you tonight in a way I couldn't touch you. What's that? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And there's a few other things it means to, you know, to control the feelings, to to curb the the middrift, to have a a disciplined mind, a correct mind. And the word power there, I found this interesting because it means it's a force. It's it's it's a strength. It's a spirit that moves. And as you begin to read through it, it's a power of the miraculous. A miracle was the word it used. Strength and a power that gives you the ability to not be timid, but timid concerning what? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Timid concerning the word of God. Don't be timid with it. because it gives you the ability to call things or to call God as able to fulfill his promise. Remember Mad, Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego? &gt;&gt; Well, we don't know what's going to happen, but we really don't care because we know God is able. &gt;&gt; That's that's not really timid, is it? Where's the fire, man? We want to get on with this. And so it's a spirit of power to not be timid concerning the things of God. And that comes by way of the love of God. And the word there is agape, which is God's, you know, God's love. And it says uh, you know, a couple of the other words that went along with that is the the breath. What's in the breath? What do you you see that? No, you can't see it. What is it? It's air. Where is our meeting place with God? &gt;&gt; Where do we meet him? For this we say unto you by the word of the Lord. Praise the Lord. I'm sure you're familiar with that. And so also means charity or uh that possible was the the next the last word in that list there. And it means what was the the song that went around the world seven times? All things are possible. Only believe. What was the requirement for resurrection and life? Only believe. And so we see here he says that and then he said with this power that it's a power to to to receive to believe that all things are possible. But there's another part there that we'll we'll get to here in just a second because then it says the power of love and that was agape to do over to be a lover of God's word to be we God is doting or or or being so careful with his little bride because he loves you &gt;&gt; right &gt;&gt; it's his agape love that he is projecting to us how &gt;&gt; through the seed of David. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Through the power of God that's in this book, he's he's doing was the word it used. Dope to dot over to to c to bring charity. And one of the other things there was to have a love feast. Well, then you go to the book of Jude and all of a sudden you see, you know, there's spots in he said in in your love feast. There are spots in the love feast of this hour. Yeah, &gt;&gt; there are spots that they don't control the emotions. I've been in services, we call it the message, friends. The guys were screaming so loud, I couldn't even tell you what the preacher was saying. That is not a spirit of control. In fact, it's out of control. The deacons should have took him out of the the the courtroom. Yeah, it's a court. It really is. said, "The judgment begins at the house of God." &gt;&gt; They should have been escorted out. Said, "Hey, you're not under in control. &gt;&gt; You don't have a a spirit of a sound mind." Just my opinion. You don't have to believe that. But that was out of control. The love feast has its spots according to the book of Jude. But there's something else. Well, now we'll just Lord willing, we'll close here as we go back to John the first chapter because part of this what he's given us is a power, a spirit of love, a spirit of power. And in John the first chapter and I hear so many people preach about the first you know out of the first chapter of John and of course they should. It's such a beautiful chapter and it starts out as you all know in the beginning was the word. The word was with God. The word was God. The same was in the beginning with God. If you really want to go on off on a little different branch there, who's the beginning? &gt;&gt; Jesus said, "I'm the beginning. I am the beginning." So, and he is the word of God. And then it comes down, but in verse 12, to me, this is almost an ignored verse. But as many as received him, to them gave he power &gt;&gt; to become the sons of God. &gt;&gt; Even to them that have met the qualification of belief. &gt;&gt; I know I'm expanding. To them that believe, but believe on what? His name. And we've been told the name and the word. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Are the same thing. Yes, sir. And if we have received him, the word of God, the seed of David, and we have met the qualification that we believe it, we have now, according to Paul, received a a a mind, a mind that is conforming to the word of God, a mind that has the power to create or to make us h power to become the sons of God. The power to become sons of God lies in the word of God by as Paul said according to my gospel according to this gospel. And it was so important that in that catching up vision, whatever you want to call it, he turns back and he said, "I preached what Paul preached." Yeah. &gt;&gt; So the power the same power of the resurrection that was in according to Paul's gospel is the same power of resurrection that lives in the God of this message in the God of what I have received and what you have received. If we if thou can't believe all things are possible. The power of resurrection is here. &gt;&gt; It's not Yeah, it was back there. And yeah, it is up there, but it's also right here. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; If thou can't believe. Praise the Lord. Sister, why don't you come to the piano? Otherwise, I might, you know, like I said, I missed a few weeks. Might go a long ways. God bless you. Let's just stand. Let's sing that song once more. I love that song. And we, you know, first time I ever heard it, uh, Lord, you are so precious. And I think I've probably said this here before, but I I learned it in Madagascar. And I learned it in the Malagasi language. And in that language, it's Jehosho siri kuo and tiao. So if you want to say I love you to somebody in Malagas, you just say tia cano. And uh so Lord, you are so preious to me. Lord, you are so preious to me. When love projects, love you. Yes, I love you because you first loved me. Oh Lord, you are so graceious to me. Lord, you are so graceious to me and I love you. Yes, I love you because you first loved me. I'll sing it for you and we'll do it once more and I'll I'll sing it in Malagasi. It's a beautiful language. You go ahead and sing in English or Spanish or whatever. We did that once at Brother Riches. We sang in seven different languages at the same time. First two or three times through it was pretty rough. But when the Holy Spirit came down because when you project your love to him, he answers with the love of God in the Holy Spirit. And by the last two or three times we sang it, it was like one voice. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So let's sing it once more. He so he sitt I'm J. So, [Music] I'm cool. I'm tea. [Music] Oh tree [Music] me allow. You are so preious to me, brother. Oh Lord, you are so preious. [Music] I love you. Yes, I love you because you first love me and I love you. Yes, I love you. because you first loved me. God bless you. Thank you for your time for coming out. I love you. &gt;&gt; And just remember when love projects, it's like the echo is one place in the Bible. It says that when the voice speaks, the vi the bride's recovery is the echo. It's the same voice going back to him that came to us. It's the love of God in Jesus Christ. Let's pick up the speed here. Do you know that I am resolved? And I'll hand it over to Isaac, my son. I am resolved no longer to linger, charmed by the world's delight. Things that are higher, things that are no, these have a Lord. God bless you. I will hasten to him. Hasten so glad and free.

Hallelujah. Did you enjoy that? Amen. Hallelujah. Amen. I amum. Greater is he that is in me. [Music] Satan's like a roaring lion roaming to and fro seeking whom he made devout. The Bible tells me so. Many souls have been his prey to fall in some weak hour. But God has given us today his overcoming power. Greater is he that is in me. Greater is he that is in me. Greater is he that is in me than he that is in the world. On the day of Pentecost, a rushing mighty wind blew into the upper room and baptized all of them with a power greater than any earthly flow. And I'm so glad I've got it, too. I'm going to let the whole world know. Greater is he that is in me. Greater is he that is in me. Greater is he that is in me than he that is in the world. Greater is he that is in me. Greater is he that is in me. Greater is he that is in me than he that is in the world. Amen. Glory to God. Amen. Amen. I'm going to do something a little bit different. I uh this I don't know came on my heart my came the other day. We're in a we last year when we did the camp out, we were all sitting around the campfire singing. Um, and you talking about the resurrection and us stepping in to that, you know, stepping out of this world and into the next just brought it back to me. But, um, we were sitting around the campfire at the camp out last year and we sang a couple songs. One of the songs we sang was in the sweet by and by and it was just so beautiful there under the stars and blending our voices together. singing and I just I'd like to try that. I do an ac capella. Just close your eyes. Let's sing this together as we're we dismissed tonight. But uh just think of that. Look forward to that day. Amen. There's a land that is fairer than day. No, no piano. &gt;&gt; See it aar for the father waits over the way to prepare us a dwelling place there in the sweet. High and by we shall meet on that beautiful shore in the sweet by and by.

The melodious songs of the blessed and our spirit shall sorrow no more. ought a sigh for the blessing of rest in the sweet by and by. We shall meet on that beautiful shore in the sweet by and by. We shall meet on that beautiful shore to our boundful father above. We will offer our tribute of praise for the glorious gift of his love. and the blessings that hollow our days. In the sweet.
