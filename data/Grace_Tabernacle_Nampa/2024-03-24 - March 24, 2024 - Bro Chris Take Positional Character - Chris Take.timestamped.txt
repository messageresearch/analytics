[31:22] [Music]
[31:25] service my nerves say sing another song
[31:28] but we're gonna we're going to turn into
[31:30] the word tonight Matthew chapter
[31:33] 22 it's good to be here tonight in House
[31:36] of
[31:38] God you know I think uh I think we take
[31:42] ourselves a little too
[31:44] serious in general and the word of God
[31:46] not serious
[31:50] enough these are the literal words of
[31:56] God yeah praise the Lord Matthew chapter
[32:00] 22:1
[32:03] 15 says then went the Pharisees and took
[32:06] counsel how they might entangle him in
[32:08] his talk and they sent out unto him
[32:11] their disciples with the herodians
[32:13] saying
[32:16] Master we know that thou art true and
[32:18] teachest the way of God in truth neither
[32:21] carest thou for any man for thou
[32:23] regardest not the person of
[32:26] men they are
[32:31] underestimated the holy spirit's ability
[32:33] to discern the hearts and thought they'd
[32:35] sugarcoat their words but he knew
[32:38] exactly what they were there
[32:40] for tell us therefore what thinkest thou
[32:43] is it lawful to give tribute unto Caesar
[32:46] or not but Jesus perceived their
[32:48] wickedness and said why tempt ye me you
[32:52] Hypocrites now you have to remember
[32:53] Jesus had no malice he had no gu so when
[32:57] he said these words he wasn't spitting
[32:59] back at them he was simply calling out
[33:04] exactly who they
[33:06] were and a real child of God would hear
[33:10] those words and immediately go to
[33:13] repenting yeah that's how God speaks to
[33:16] us he doesn't he doesn't he doesn't um
[33:20] accuse us he points out where our
[33:22] weaknesses are and he does so in such a
[33:25] way that he can call you a hypocrite to
[33:27] your face oh God forgive me right cuz
[33:29] there's love in how he's portraying that
[33:33] so even even in his verdict to them
[33:38] there was an opportunity for them to
[33:40] respond back and say oh you know what
[33:43] you're right I'm sorry you you keep
[33:46] talking says show me the tribute money
[33:50] and they brought unto him a penny and he
[33:52] said unto them who is this image and
[33:55] superscription they say unto him Caesars
[33:59] then saith he unto them render therefore
[34:01] unto Caesars the
[34:03] thing that excuse me render therefore
[34:06] unto Caesar the things which are Caesars
[34:08] and unto God the things that are Gods
[34:11] when they had heard these words they
[34:13] marveled and left him and went their
[34:16] way the same day came him came to him
[34:19] the Sadducees so big day big day which
[34:23] say that there is no resurrection and
[34:25] asked him saying Master Moses said said
[34:27] if a man die having no children his
[34:29] brother shall marry his wife and raise
[34:31] up seed unto his brother now there were
[34:34] with us seven Brethren now see Jesus is
[34:36] very familiar with the story first not
[34:38] not only because he is literally God in
[34:40] flesh but because this is in his
[34:42] lineage right you had uh judah's Sons
[34:46] married um that that lady I can't
[34:49] remember her name right now but tamaron
[34:51] right and was supposed to raise up the
[34:52] seed right so Jesus is very familiar
[34:54] with this he understands exactly where
[34:56] they're going I'm sure everyone else
[34:58] there listening did too now there were
[35:00] with us seven Brethren and the first
[35:02] when he had married a wife deceased and
[35:04] having no issue left his wife unto his
[35:06] brother likewise the second also and the
[35:08] Third on down un third unto the seventh
[35:11] last of all the woman died also very
[35:14] realistic situation therefore in the
[35:16] resurrection whose wife shall she be of
[35:19] the seven for they all had her Jesus
[35:22] answered and said unto him you do error
[35:24] not knowing the scriptures nor the power
[35:26] of God for in the resurrection they
[35:29] neither marry nor are given in marriage
[35:31] but are as the angels of God in heaven
[35:33] but as touching the resurrection of the
[35:35] Dead have you not read that which was
[35:37] spoken unto you by God saying I am the
[35:39] god of Abraham the god of Isaac the god
[35:42] of Jacob God is not the god of the dead
[35:44] but of the living lengthy reading but
[35:46] just hang on and when the multitude
[35:49] heard this they were astonished at his
[35:51] Doctrine so Pharisees come to him and
[35:53] they challenge him on on on paying your
[35:56] taxes and then the sadu es come to him
[35:58] and challenge him on the resurrection
[36:00] this is their favorite topic to debate
[36:02] because they didn't believe in the
[36:03] resurrection
[36:05] and now the Pharisees ver verse 34 they
[36:10] heard that he put the Sadducees to
[36:13] silence so they gathered back together
[36:16] they said well you know what we could we
[36:18] got to do better than the Sadducees so
[36:20] then one of them which was a lawyer
[36:21] asked him a question tempting him and
[36:23] saying Master what is the great
[36:25] commandment in the law
[36:29] Jesus said unto him Thou shalt love the
[36:30] Lord thy God with all thy heart with all
[36:32] thy soul with all thy mind this is the
[36:35] first and great commandment and the
[36:37] second is like unto it Thou shalt love
[36:39] thy neighbor as thyself on these two
[36:42] Commandments hang all the law and the
[36:45] prophets so he he stumped them again and
[36:49] while the Pharisees were gathered
[36:50] together Jesus asked them so now he
[36:52] turns and he brings the word back to
[36:54] them so now Jesus is not is not in
[36:57] engaging in a in in a
[37:01] debate the devil is trying to undermine
[37:04] the sermon of the day by sending the
[37:06] Sadducees and the Pharisees or the
[37:08] Pharisees Sadducees and the Pharisees
[37:10] again so now Jesus
[37:13] turns and rebukes the devil to leave and
[37:18] he says what think ye of Christ whose
[37:21] son is he they say unto him the son of
[37:24] David hey we got this one easy he says
[37:27] unto them them how then do David in
[37:29] spirit call him Lord saying the Lord
[37:31] said unto my Lord sit thou on my right
[37:33] hand till I make thine enemies thy foot
[37:35] stol if David then call him Lord how is
[37:39] he his son and no man was able to answer
[37:42] him a word neither Durst any man from
[37:44] that day forth ask him any more
[37:47] questions let's bow our heads Heavenly
[37:50] Father Lord I pray you minister to our
[37:52] hearts tonight Lord we have no desire to
[37:54] make anything of ourselves we just
[37:56] simply have come to hear your word to
[37:58] share your word Lord to receive the life
[38:01] that your word has in it Lord I ask you
[38:03] just push aside every spirit that would
[38:05] be contrary to your word May the Holy
[38:07] Spirit take full control tonight and you
[38:09] just minister to us may there just be an
[38:11] atmosphere father of your presence here
[38:13] tonight we ask we love you Lord we thank
[38:16] you in Jesus Christ's name we pray amen
[38:18] you may be seated tonight thank you for
[38:19] standing for that
[38:21] reading I tried to to to cut it where I
[38:24] could but I wanted to bring these these
[38:26] three different situations this story
[38:29] and and how Jesus handled this
[38:34] and you know if you think about it
[38:38] um you you have to remember he was he
[38:41] was all God and He was all
[38:43] man and in his ministry he put up with a
[38:48] lot he dealt with a lot and you know I
[38:52] believe it's Paul says you know next
[38:54] time you think you have to deal with a
[38:56] lot remember what Jesus had to deal with
[38:57] deal with right in so many words and so
[39:00] I wanted to look tonight and my title is
[39:03] um
[39:05] positional positional
[39:08] character and uh my subtitle is position
[39:12] position by
[39:13] invitation but I I have this I had this
[39:17] line in my notes and as I was meditating
[39:20] on what to minister tonight the Lord
[39:22] directed me here and so if I could say
[39:24] that the the subject or the thesis or of
[39:27] the the point tonight that we want to
[39:28] look at is that it it's the character of
[39:31] the person that makes the position the
[39:34] position does not make the person so for
[39:38] example in our world if you take a man
[39:40] who off the street and he he can't hold
[39:43] the job he can't and he has not
[39:45] disciplined enough to keep himself clean
[39:47] and keep himself away from from drugs
[39:49] and and alcohol and and he's just a mess
[39:51] and you clean him up and you make him
[39:53] the CEO of Apple guess
[39:56] what couple days he'll be back on the
[39:58] street right so even though you gave him
[40:00] the
[40:01] position it didn't change him so when it
[40:04] comes to being a Son of God God has to
[40:07] mold your character for the position
[40:09] he's calling you to so there is no you
[40:12] know when brother talks about adoption
[40:14] you're born right you you receive the
[40:16] new birth and he gives you the Holy
[40:17] Spirit to be the inward teacher the
[40:19] tutor to come unto adoption because
[40:22] you're not born and immediately now
[40:25] you're ready for a position you have no
[40:27] character right so you need character
[40:30] for your position and we all hold a
[40:32] unique position in the body of Christ so
[40:36] my character molding is going to look
[40:38] different than titus's character molding
[40:41] now there'll be some situations that are
[40:42] similar right you know my dad believed
[40:45] in spanking titus's dad believed in
[40:47] spanking right so there's similar things
[40:49] that God that the Lord does as he moves
[40:51] us along but how it comes to us how we
[40:57] receive it how we see it through our
[41:00] perspective is all very very different
[41:03] you know we're we're we all come to
[41:05] church tonight and and there's you know
[41:07] I don't know how many people are tonight
[41:08] I'm terrible at at guessing people but
[41:10] maybe about 20 of us here you you think
[41:13] about the the individuals that each of
[41:15] us have touched down to the youngest
[41:17] each of us have touched In Our
[41:20] Lifetime those are those are
[41:23] experiences to each individual so you
[41:25] say oh there's only 20 people here but
[41:28] each one of you has an entire world an
[41:30] entire story an
[41:32] entire I mean history that has just
[41:36] touched and and moved and and you know
[41:38] especially you know brother Paul and
[41:40] Brother David traveling around this
[41:42] opportunities and exposures and things
[41:44] that has come together and all of these
[41:47] do something to your character now we
[41:50] want those experiences to impact our
[41:53] character in a positive way but how it
[41:56] impact your character whether positive
[41:58] or negative is actually your choice God
[42:02] put you through a situation and he's
[42:04] looking to to to to cut this part of
[42:07] your of your flesh and this this part of
[42:09] you to mold your character in a certain
[42:11] way from this angle so he put you
[42:14] through a situation now how much of that
[42:17] gets chipped off is your abilities to
[42:20] surrender to him so when you come to a
[42:23] situation and you surrender to him and
[42:25] you're just ready and you're wide open
[42:27] God gets a good chunk off of you if I
[42:29] can have the Liberty to say so but when
[42:31] you resist and and you're caught up here
[42:33] and caught up there then God has to come
[42:35] from another angle another angle to
[42:38] swing around to come at you now God had
[42:40] this already all planned out don't think
[42:42] God's out there guessing think well do I
[42:43] hit here or do I hit
[42:45] here no he had this all planned out
[42:47] before there was even a speck of dust in
[42:50] the universe he knew exactly how your
[42:52] character would be molded but you see we
[42:55] we he gave us a free moral agency so we
[42:58] have the ability to choose how we
[43:00] approach a situation how we approach an
[43:05] invitation to mle our character now
[43:07] let's go to this quote here I know I had
[43:10] the scriptures there but uh this a first
[43:13] quote to see
[43:16] Jesus he
[43:23] said hold on I changed the order and
[43:26] then now I'm going to go back
[43:27] to the first order I
[43:29] had so it's the last quote there Gideon
[43:34] identification he said where would you
[43:36] be identified at that time now W with
[43:39] your character that's molded in
[43:46] you I'm sorry
[43:55] okay I'm trying to find a have a quote
[43:57] here let's see here just give me one
[43:59] second it's worth it hang
[44:02] on okay sorry identification
[44:07] 64 um it will be the second quote there
[44:13] and his character was that he did
[44:14] everything that pleased God so we're
[44:16] back to Jesus now because we read this
[44:17] story this these altercations that Jesus
[44:20] had and that that's a glimpse into into
[44:23] the stress and and the intensity that he
[44:26] had to deal with in his min hisory and
[44:28] all of this was was completely
[44:29] pre-ordained I mean it was ready to be
[44:31] written in the scriptures when it would
[44:32] happen God anointed Matthew to write it
[44:34] down so this was all a part of God's
[44:36] plan but it's it's an everything he
[44:39] experienced he experienced purposefully
[44:42] for you and I and so he says here
[44:45] brother says here he says and his
[44:46] character was that he did everything
[44:48] that pleased God and he stayed with the
[44:51] word so he comes up I mean you you
[44:55] sometimes you know you deal with people
[44:56] and and and in my how I work you know
[44:59] it's it's on a call or a video call or
[45:03] messaging and and you pulling your hair
[45:05] out sometimes trying to communicate
[45:06] clearly to somebody and and just you
[45:08] lose your patience and nobody knows it
[45:11] because you're thankfully behind a
[45:13] camera with a muted mic and just that
[45:15] and then you put it back on and says oh
[45:16] yes you know so we have the opportunity
[45:18] for that but he's right there in this
[45:19] moment everybody's watching everybody's
[45:21] looking at him I to slow down a little
[45:24] bit for our interpreter and
[45:27] he has to keep it all together he's got
[45:30] to keep his patience because he's he's
[45:33] dealing we heard it the other night
[45:36] somebody said stop worrying about the
[45:37] chickens if you're an eagle stop
[45:39] worrying about the chickens worry about
[45:41] the Eagles so he had to have the
[45:44] patience to deal with these these people
[45:45] because in those moments right that is a
[45:48] testimony to those that are around him
[45:50] so having the patience and the character
[45:53] to to to stand these he had he had to be
[45:55] God to make it this way he'd be
[45:58] perfect so he stayed right with the word
[46:01] that's the point I'm trying to make he
[46:03] stayed in the will of God in these
[46:06] moments and he says he goes on to say he
[46:08] says that's what he molds us for if we'd
[46:12] stay with God's word find our place and
[46:17] then know where we we were at stay with
[46:21] his word and think of it we are invited
[46:24] now this is why it's the position by
[46:25] invitation we are invited to shape our
[46:29] own character to
[46:32] his we are not required we are not
[46:37] demanded we are invited to shape our
[46:41] character to his own so guess what
[46:44] sometimes we go through trials and we
[46:45] fail them and God has to do it over
[46:49] again but you see he has the patience to
[46:52] deal with
[46:53] that if you had the patience for a bunch
[46:55] of hypocrites
[46:57] kind the patience for his own
[46:59] children so you see God has God is
[47:03] asking you he's given you the and wh why
[47:06] why because you have a position he wants
[47:10] you to hold to he wants your name to be
[47:13] as good on the check as his but you have
[47:15] to have the character for that position
[47:19] first you can't just come out and and
[47:22] suddenly right you have to have the
[47:24] character you have to be that son that
[47:26] son he was bornn he was a son but he
[47:28] needed a tutor to come to a position now
[47:32] where he had the character to come to
[47:35] the position that he was destined for
[47:39] now we know the stories you know
[47:41] sometimes the the tutor goes to the
[47:43] father and says you know he's got the
[47:46] Sheep eating the bad grass right so but
[47:49] then he's got the Sheep down there in
[47:51] the lowlands he's watching over them
[47:52] he's feeding
[47:54] them he's doing it just like you would
[47:57] do to the father so he's invited us he
[48:01] says now we're going to find out what
[48:03] we've done shape our character to his
[48:07] own Now by his own spirit so you don't
[48:12] do it of
[48:13] yourself I have learned you can't change
[48:18] yourself and that's where you know we we
[48:21] if we're not too careful the society we
[48:23] live in very similar to the Romans
[48:26] before the of the Roman Empire I mean
[48:29] self-development
[48:31] knowledge meditate yoga work out be the
[48:35] best self you look it's impossible
[48:37] without God that's you might look like
[48:40] 100% but you act like 20 right so it
[48:45] doesn't matter how you look on the
[48:48] outside that's right we say that tongue
[48:50] and cheek especially as ministers
[48:52] because we want you to be holy look to
[48:53] look holy but if the inside's right
[48:57] it has to
[48:59] manifest and and that's not just true
[49:01] for how you dress that's true for how
[49:02] you conduct yourself amen how you how
[49:06] you how you handle yourself in
[49:08] situations with your family at church
[49:11] right when when people aren't exactly
[49:13] you know the best treating of you how
[49:17] you handle that that's that's your
[49:20] character
[49:22] so it's shaped by his own Spirit which
[49:25] if you catch it goes right back to
[49:27] adoption right the holy spirit is the
[49:29] tutor he says then we by him are sons of
[49:33] God just what was expressed by having
[49:37] his mind in us so not only do we have
[49:41] his Spirit to shape us but we have the
[49:44] very mind of Christ so we think like him
[49:49] you know me and brother Alex have had
[49:50] the opportunity to do a lot of projects
[49:52] together at my house and sister Sue and
[49:54] stuff and and we just click I mean I
[49:56] reach for the screws and he's already
[49:58] got them out so working with him is just
[50:00] an absolute Joy right it's same thing
[50:02] back and forth we're right there we've
[50:05] done enough of it together we kind of
[50:06] think the same and and and that's
[50:08] exactly what God's looking for he he
[50:11] goes to to speak the word and you say
[50:14] you're right there he goes to turn
[50:16] around to ask for the crescent wrench
[50:17] and you're already handing it to
[50:19] him he he he wants you you see brother
[50:22] Bram had to deal with this in his
[50:23] ministry because brother Bram says no I
[50:25] wait until I have a vision and the angel
[50:28] of the Lord chastised him and said look
[50:31] the third pole right it's a spoken word
[50:34] what you need to be moving forward by
[50:37] faith and know that look you're not
[50:39] you're a Son of God you're an adopted
[50:40] son you need to act on the father's
[50:42] desires because you have the same mind
[50:45] amen you see we have to get this out of
[50:47] our heads that we can't be perfect we
[50:50] absolutely can be
[50:54] perfect amen so shape our character by
[50:59] having his mind in us to shape our
[51:01] character to his so it's both the Mind
[51:03] and Spirit his mind that's the mind that
[51:06] was in Christ be in you right he's
[51:08] quoting scripture if that mind is in you
[51:10] then you see he only did that which
[51:13] pleased God you see he he had he never
[51:17] did what pleased the Pharisees he never
[51:19] did what pleased the disciples if you
[51:22] read in the in the early part of of of
[51:25] of his ministry there's a
[51:28] an episode where he prays for a very
[51:31] long time for just a massive line of
[51:33] lepers and blind and sick people he a
[51:36] big old prayer line for you know almost
[51:38] all night long or however long it was
[51:40] but then he goes from there and you know
[51:41] it's it's 10 lepers it's one man at the
[51:44] pool of Bethesda right because that
[51:47] prayer line was the father's will the
[51:49] pool of Bethesda was one man that was
[51:51] the father's will you see the world
[51:54] today has it backwards when they think
[51:55] about God it says well you know love
[51:58] everyone be kind and and the the idea of
[52:01] of the culture of today that we live in
[52:03] but you see it's not about that it's
[52:05] about what does God want you to do you
[52:07] see there's a lot of things as a
[52:09] Christian that you can do but does God
[52:12] want you to do it that's right you know
[52:14] I just I listening to a sermon the other
[52:17] day I don't remember what it was I
[52:18] mentioned it in communion where brother
[52:20] says God has a season and a time so time
[52:26] and season season are not the same thing
[52:27] so you see God's word when it moves when
[52:31] it rustles in the mulberry bushes it's
[52:34] perfect it's he's divided between the
[52:37] season and the time so he says look in
[52:41] the fall September 10th 9:30 p.m. right
[52:46] I mean that's how he moves that's how he
[52:48] does things it's
[52:50] perfect and the only way you're going to
[52:52] know is if you know Christ if you have
[52:56] the Spirit of Christ in you and the mind
[52:58] of Christ so when you miss it what does
[53:02] that mean God wasn't loud
[53:04] enough no you weren't
[53:07] listening we weren't
[53:09] listening you see we take ourselves too
[53:12] serious we don't take the word of God
[53:14] serious
[53:16] enough we're so busy trying to make it
[53:20] perfect ourselves in the name of God in
[53:23] the name of of of of the word of God
[53:28] but brother says you he says get a
[53:31] prayer life and you'll be the Christian
[53:33] you want to
[53:35] be instead we
[53:38] have we're looking for you know eclipses
[53:41] and and stars and purple on the vice
[53:44] president
[53:45] and you know a news in in you know in a
[53:47] hurricane in Florida and and uh you know
[53:51] this brother that preach this meeting at
[53:52] the same time this brother over here
[53:54] preaches this and we're not praying and
[53:56] we're not feeding on the word of
[53:58] God and we think we're spiritual because
[54:00] we connected the
[54:02] dots that's how children act immature
[54:06] children
[54:08] act and I know that not everyone's going
[54:10] to agree with that statement but been
[54:12] there lived that and I'm sure I'll do it
[54:14] again because I have a lot to learn this
[54:17] is as much this is more for me I'm just
[54:19] going to be shelf selfish tonight this
[54:21] is all for
[54:22] me because I've been realizing more and
[54:25] more Lord I hi just too busy trying to
[54:27] do it myself and then somehow think that
[54:29] I you know I'm in tune to the will of
[54:31] God it's like I didn't even ask you but
[54:33] somehow I think oh I've got it figured
[54:35] out I didn't even bother asking God this
[54:38] is what you want me to do I just said
[54:40] well a plus b equals c and squar it and
[54:44] and the calculator gives me the number
[54:46] and hey yeah this is it but I never
[54:49] asked
[54:54] God so he says his mind
[54:57] okay he only did that which pleased God
[55:00] I mean what a place to live what a
[55:02] position to be in right but he had to
[55:04] have the character for that position
[55:07] Jesus lived on the earth for 30 years
[55:09] before he ever started his ministry amen
[55:12] he went through some character molding
[55:15] do you know how much he was ridiculed
[55:16] his entire life for being a bastard
[55:19] child nobody believed the story oh sure
[55:22] Mary nobody believed it Not only was was
[55:25] it unbelievable she's from Nazareth
[55:27] everybody knows what happens in
[55:30] Nazareth that's how they treated him he
[55:33] had no friends in
[55:34] school he had you know he just had his
[55:37] dad in the wood in the wood
[55:41] shop he knowed who he was he came the
[55:44] son you see that's how you stand against
[55:46] the pressure of of the age you know who
[55:48] you are that's right because when you
[55:51] know who you are which to to say the
[55:53] same thing in a different way is to say
[55:55] you know your
[55:57] itions then somebody else comes along
[55:59] with a better idea you're not going to
[56:02] fold to them because this is what you
[56:06] believe no matter how convincing they
[56:07] are that's Revelation that's
[56:11] right because you know who you
[56:15] are so if you find yourself folding to
[56:19] pressure go find out who you are that's
[56:24] right go get in contact with God and
[56:28] it's really as simple as just as praying
[56:31] more and feeding on the word of God
[56:33] that's
[56:33] right it has to be simple because if it
[56:36] was complicated everybody would do
[56:39] it he know who he was he came the Son of
[56:43] God and if you think that's not biblical
[56:44] look at
[56:45] non non was like dip in the muddy Jordan
[56:48] River that's too
[56:50] simple he came the Son of
[56:54] God he know know he was to take that
[56:58] place his character had to be that way
[57:00] his character had to be that way his
[57:03] character had to be that way having
[57:05] taking his taken his place he know what
[57:08] the Messiah was required of so he knew
[57:10] what the position required and he knew
[57:13] he had the character for the position so
[57:16] he did only what the father said to do
[57:19] and that is how he fulfilled the own his
[57:21] own word he spoke because he was the
[57:25] spirit and the mind of Christ in
[57:28] flesh so he had to act the
[57:36] word you have to act the
[57:39] word see that that understanding of
[57:43] scripture that understanding that God
[57:45] wants you to catch a hold of that you
[57:48] will act the word you have to act word
[57:50] that's not a that's not an easy way
[57:53] out that is there to give you the
[57:56] confidence that you can yeah you see if
[58:01] you start to look at it as well if I'm
[58:04] the bride I'll be the
[58:06] bride and you just kind of
[58:09] drift you're you're you're if you're the
[58:11] bride everything's going to just get
[58:15] messy because God wants you to have be
[58:18] encouraged by that not to to give up I
[58:21] just said the same thing twice in a row
[58:24] maybe someone need a different wording
[58:26] his character had to be that way he knew
[58:29] what the Messiah was required of and he
[58:31] always sought at God to do those things
[58:33] and did nothing until the father showed
[58:37] him
[58:39] now let's go to Romans chapter 8 verse
[58:45] 5 you know sometimes especially I I find
[58:48] for myself when I get into books like
[58:50] Romans it's really hard to find the
[58:51] verse to stop and if you're not careful
[58:54] you just read the whole book
[59:01] Romans chapter 8 verse5 for they that
[59:04] are after The Flesh do mind the things
[59:05] of the flesh but they that are after the
[59:08] spirit the things of the
[59:09] spirit for to be carnally minded is
[59:12] death but to be spiritually minded is
[59:14] life and peace now we just found we just
[59:16] talked about why okay because the carnal
[59:19] mind is enmity against God for it is not
[59:22] subject to the law of God neither in
[59:26] can be amen so your carnal mind the
[59:29] carnal mind is always against God Amen
[59:34] now you say
[59:36] well no not not
[59:40] not what you think it's just oh I can do
[59:45] that that's the carnal
[59:47] mind say I I'll arrange it that's the
[59:50] carnal
[59:52] mind says well that was pretty good song
[59:55] special that's the carnal
[59:58] mind it is not a it's not carnal mind
[1:00:00] isn't crafting how you're going to fraud
[1:00:02] the government and get away with fake
[1:00:05] checks right that's not the carnal mind
[1:00:07] I mean it is that's not what Paul's
[1:00:09] talking about he says when I would do
[1:00:10] good evil is present with me so we're
[1:00:12] going to turn around and say well you
[1:00:13] know Paul just sinned all day every day
[1:00:16] no no because you see when you become a
[1:00:18] Son of God things get down to the
[1:00:21] razor's Edge
[1:00:22] right so it's little things like just
[1:00:26] you know hey you know that person would
[1:00:27] just get their act together no how about
[1:00:31] I need to pray for that person yes it is
[1:00:35] right or well you know if the pastor
[1:00:37] just would have handled it like this it
[1:00:39] would have been a lot better
[1:00:42] no Lord if that was correct show me if
[1:00:45] not give my pastor better wisdom that's
[1:00:48] how you handle that that's the mature
[1:00:51] Christian that's the mature bride that's
[1:00:53] the one who's taking the character now
[1:00:55] guess what you begin to act that way
[1:00:57] suddenly God gives you
[1:01:00] more God gives you a promotion
[1:01:04] right there are revelations in the word
[1:01:06] that are waiting for you if you'll just
[1:01:08] stop acting like a little kid you see
[1:01:11] Revelation isn't about how do I say this
[1:01:14] correctly Revelation isn't necessarily
[1:01:16] about how long you sit in the word it's
[1:01:19] how much your character molds to Christ
[1:01:22] then he says okay right because think
[1:01:24] about it as as as a as the son's growing
[1:01:27] up um he begin he he acts appropriately
[1:01:31] and he's given a little bit of
[1:01:32] responsibility okay your responsibility
[1:01:34] is to make sure all these papers every
[1:01:36] day are ordered by by uh invoice number
[1:01:39] and they're stacked neatly on the desk
[1:01:42] once he shows he's responsible in that
[1:01:44] no matter what happens rain or shine or
[1:01:47] his buddies want to play those papers
[1:01:49] are stacked in order and perfectly in
[1:01:52] place like the father asked him to be
[1:01:54] okay this is the tutor now he's the one
[1:01:57] writing the
[1:01:58] invoices okay so the same thing is going
[1:02:00] to happen to you spiritually as you grow
[1:02:02] in the word of God God's God's going to
[1:02:05] challenge you with
[1:02:08] responsibility however that may look
[1:02:10] shake out I can't think of an example
[1:02:12] but God will challenge you and and and
[1:02:14] and he will see can you be faithful with
[1:02:16] your tithes can you be faithful with
[1:02:19] offering can you be faithful you know
[1:02:21] it's your turn to clean the church can
[1:02:22] you be faithful to clean the church will
[1:02:25] you put your best foot forward or where
[1:02:26] you you know Skip the baseboards under
[1:02:29] the
[1:02:31] Pew right and then he sees okay now I
[1:02:37] have something more for you but we all
[1:02:40] want to jump out the gate and and we we
[1:02:42] see our our kids do this right man you
[1:02:45] know
[1:02:46] uh dad can I can I try the the skill saw
[1:02:50] absolutely
[1:02:52] not when you're we always say when
[1:02:54] you're older but what we mean is is when
[1:02:56] you're more
[1:02:57] mature then yes so we're we we get you
[1:03:01] know sometimes they don't they're not
[1:03:02] happy with that decision so they'll
[1:03:03] throw a fit we do the same thing to God
[1:03:06] he says well God you know I I I I want
[1:03:08] to be I want to be just this spiritual
[1:03:11] you know
[1:03:12] wow and God's
[1:03:15] like we take care of your house right
[1:03:18] clean it up I bless you with a home take
[1:03:21] care of it or or I I I bless you with
[1:03:24] the ability to sit and and play play an
[1:03:26] instrument be the best you can be then
[1:03:29] I'll have more for
[1:03:31] you I believe that God when God gives
[1:03:34] you a talent for the musicians song
[1:03:36] leaders whoever it may be or actually
[1:03:39] everybody yet God gives you a talent you
[1:03:41] have to show because as it now remember
[1:03:43] it's different for the children of God
[1:03:45] we don't care about how they do it out
[1:03:46] there or how others do it for the
[1:03:48] children of God the remember the higher
[1:03:50] calling uh that that that brother in in
[1:03:53] China um whatever I can't remember his
[1:03:56] name right now but years ago still a
[1:03:59] brother um
[1:04:02] but God won't allow it to work for you
[1:04:04] if you you want to sing you know I have
[1:04:06] a friend and if I said him by name you
[1:04:08] would know who he is so I won't say him
[1:04:09] by name but he was at a meeting and he
[1:04:11] has a he has a phenomenal voice and he's
[1:04:14] at the at at at some C at some meetings
[1:04:16] and and he says he says let me see the
[1:04:18] lineup and he looks and he's like oh
[1:04:19] yeah I'll have no problem tonight God
[1:04:22] completely blasted his voice and he
[1:04:25] couldn't s
[1:04:26] you see that'll work for them out there
[1:04:29] but that's not going to work for a Son
[1:04:30] of God because a gift is given to be a
[1:04:32] blessing to the body of Christ so Titus
[1:04:35] as you get better you say I'm going to
[1:04:36] honor God in my life and in my playing
[1:04:38] suddenly new chords will come C notes
[1:04:41] new notes will come out new bow
[1:04:43] movements will come out and just wow
[1:04:45] where did that come from that's God
[1:04:47] blessing your gift because you're
[1:04:48] willing to honor him
[1:04:51] amen and that's how it works but then he
[1:04:53] honors you with that and then if you get
[1:04:55] a little bit of pride guess what
[1:04:56] suddenly you can't do it anymore you
[1:04:58] just I just my fingers won't go where
[1:04:59] they're supposed to go and as God then
[1:05:02] God will whisper in your ear and said
[1:05:03] you see it's not for you it's for me
[1:05:06] amen okay same thing is in business you
[1:05:08] know how where you work and how you do
[1:05:10] your
[1:05:11] job
[1:05:13] so he says to be spiritually minded is
[1:05:15] life and peace we are we are in verse
[1:05:20] S we're in verse eight so then they that
[1:05:23] are in the flesh cannot please God
[1:05:26] you know that's not reserved for not
[1:05:28] unbelievers that is that is us we get in
[1:05:31] the flesh we're not going to please
[1:05:33] God and here's the thing about it Saints
[1:05:36] is God's going to let you know that
[1:05:39] you're not pleasing
[1:05:40] him
[1:05:43] okay but you are not in the flesh but in
[1:05:46] the spirit if so be that the spirit of
[1:05:48] God dwell in you now if any man have not
[1:05:51] the spirit of Christ he is none of his
[1:05:53] so you have to have the spirit of Christ
[1:05:54] right and if Christ Christ be in you the
[1:05:57] body is dead because of sin but the
[1:05:59] spirit is life because of righteousness
[1:06:02] so you're draging around a dead
[1:06:05] man but if the spirit of him that raised
[1:06:08] up Jesus from the dead dwell in you he
[1:06:10] that raised up Christ from the dead
[1:06:11] shall also Quicken your mortal bodies by
[1:06:14] his spirit that dwelleth in you you see
[1:06:16] it's all about the spirit of Christ is
[1:06:18] going to manifest Christ in your life
[1:06:22] your your body you know our sister
[1:06:24] Joanne her body can't do nothing it's
[1:06:27] going to be raised up because the spirit
[1:06:30] of Christ it can't hold it back nothing
[1:06:32] can hold it back right nothing can hold
[1:06:35] it back so so so the the desires of the
[1:06:38] world though they be strong for a
[1:06:41] season you will overcome them because
[1:06:44] the spirit of Christ within you can't be
[1:06:47] held back as an encouragement you have a
[1:06:50] job to do surrender to God and eat the
[1:06:54] book right
[1:06:57] therefore brethren we are debt not to
[1:06:59] the flesh to live after the flesh so we
[1:07:02] don't we we don't we don't owe this
[1:07:04] flesh anything
[1:07:07] amen for if you live live after the
[1:07:09] flesh you shall die but if you through
[1:07:11] the spirit do mortify the Deeds of the
[1:07:14] body you shall live so through the
[1:07:19] spirit for as many as are led by the
[1:07:21] spirit of God they are sons of God
[1:07:23] praise the Lord for you have not
[1:07:25] received received the spirit of bondage
[1:07:26] again to fear but you have received the
[1:07:28] spirit of adoption whereby we cry Abba
[1:07:32] Father looking to the father right we
[1:07:34] desire to please the father because we
[1:07:37] want to receive we want to be adopted
[1:07:42] Sons and Daughters of God the spirit
[1:07:44] itself beareth witness with our spirit
[1:07:46] that we are the children of God Amen to
[1:07:50] see
[1:07:52] Jesus well we we I'll read these
[1:07:54] scriptures here sorry right there uh
[1:07:56] John 5:19 then answered Jesus and said
[1:07:59] unto them verily verily I say unto you
[1:08:01] the son can do nothing of himself but
[1:08:03] what he seeth the father do interesting
[1:08:07] he says seeth the father do so the
[1:08:09] father did it
[1:08:10] first for what things soever he doeth
[1:08:13] these also doeth the son likewise so the
[1:08:15] tutor is saying look look how Papa does
[1:08:17] it look how your father does it do it
[1:08:20] that way right right so God's showing
[1:08:23] you this is how it's done do this same
[1:08:26] thing right John John 5:30 a little
[1:08:29] further down I can of my own self do
[1:08:33] nothing this is God in flesh
[1:08:37] amen all God all man I mean the Pinnacle
[1:08:41] of History do you know history revolves
[1:08:43] around Jesus being on
[1:08:45] earth a what is it BC or ad BC or
[1:08:50] backwards BC ad right I mean it's it's
[1:08:54] the point in history
[1:08:56] historians the world over can't deny
[1:08:58] Jesus was here on
[1:09:01] Earth and he says I can't do
[1:09:05] anything as I hear I judge and my
[1:09:09] judgment is just now he just said he
[1:09:12] can't do anything but then he goes
[1:09:14] follows up and says as I hear I judge
[1:09:16] and my judgment is just
[1:09:19] Why semicolon because I seek not my own
[1:09:23] will but the will of the Father which
[1:09:25] hath sent me so you have the right to
[1:09:28] say my judgment is just when you operate
[1:09:31] according to the spirit of Christ in
[1:09:32] your life people come to people come and
[1:09:35] they say well don't you know Only God
[1:09:36] can judge
[1:09:39] me you're looking at
[1:09:42] him but you see you're never going to
[1:09:45] condemn them to to to uh to um you're
[1:09:50] not going to judge them to condemnation
[1:09:52] you're going to judge judge them to
[1:09:53] Restoration right you have a desire to
[1:09:56] see them change you know as a as as a
[1:09:58] minister you get up here and you begin
[1:10:00] to speak and you come under the the
[1:10:01] anointing of God and and things start to
[1:10:04] open up and you see people and you see
[1:10:07] their struggles you know you're sitting
[1:10:08] in the Pew you you can't hide and you
[1:10:11] see I'm not saying it's perfect I'm
[1:10:13] still a man I'm not trying to say I'm
[1:10:15] kind of prophet but God gives you the
[1:10:17] window and sometimes to see certain
[1:10:18] things and as it's a burden you carry
[1:10:22] because you say God I want to see them
[1:10:24] succeed God I want to see them but guess
[1:10:28] what it's God and it has to be God but
[1:10:31] when you harness yourself to the word of
[1:10:33] God your judgment will be
[1:10:36] just right so don't be afraid to judge
[1:10:39] you need to judge situations you need to
[1:10:41] judge individuals not to condemnation
[1:10:43] not to gossip about them right because
[1:10:45] then you're not doing it according to
[1:10:46] the will of God now you're just doing it
[1:10:48] as a man and that's where it says judge
[1:10:49] not that you be not judged that's what
[1:10:51] that scripture means but when you're
[1:10:52] looking at situations and you're saying
[1:10:54] I'm concerned about this the spirit of
[1:10:56] Christ says take that to prayer then you
[1:10:59] take that to prayer you SE an individual
[1:11:01] you say kids stay away from him right
[1:11:03] you're rightfully judging it's the Holy
[1:11:05] Spirit Discerning the situation before
[1:11:07] you and that is the spirit of
[1:11:09] Christ
[1:11:13] so amen and two see Jesus he says but
[1:11:17] trying to get in now this is the pool of
[1:11:19] bethesa now trying to get into this pool
[1:11:21] this Mighty mess of suffering there and
[1:11:23] Jesus walking right through that crowd
[1:11:24] of people lame Hal blind withered that's
[1:11:27] our lovely Lord full of compassion
[1:11:30] walked right through these those blind
[1:11:32] people those sick people those screaming
[1:11:34] people those lame people those halt
[1:11:36] people those maimed people you know
[1:11:38] brother brand was speaking from
[1:11:42] experience he's had to you know remember
[1:11:44] he in his early Ministry he stood at the
[1:11:46] pulpit for like what was it eight days
[1:11:48] or something like that praying for
[1:11:50] people Non-Stop and by the time he got
[1:11:51] to that point where he was just about to
[1:11:53] have a nervous breakdown there was more
[1:11:55] people than when he started so brother
[1:11:57] bam knows exactly firsthand what this
[1:11:59] feels like to walk past those maed
[1:12:01] people knowing that they have the faith
[1:12:04] and God has the ability to heal them but
[1:12:05] it's not the will of the father so now
[1:12:07] Jesus you don't think that tugged on him
[1:12:09] as a man I mean that was that was a
[1:12:11] burden to walk in pray for that man and
[1:12:14] walk out and leave all those people
[1:12:15] suffering and he knew their outcomes
[1:12:18] he's God he knew as he walked by that
[1:12:21] man's going to die tomorrow and there
[1:12:23] was nothing he could do because he was
[1:12:25] completely harnessed to the will of the
[1:12:27] father you think oh it's just Jesus it
[1:12:29] was easy no Jesus had to know what it's
[1:12:31] like that's why he was all man but all
[1:12:34] God he had to know what it's like so
[1:12:35] when you're out there and you say well
[1:12:37] be kind help everybody and God says no
[1:12:39] only this that's it you have to stand
[1:12:42] against doing the right thing because
[1:12:45] you're doing the will of the father amen
[1:12:48] I this is an important lesson that I had
[1:12:50] to that I had continually we have to
[1:12:52] learn because we can look at it and we
[1:12:54] say well as a Christian I need to do
[1:12:55] this this is the right thing to do but
[1:12:57] did God ask you to do it did God tell
[1:12:59] you to do
[1:13:00] it you know there are situations where
[1:13:03] where where we have heard different
[1:13:04] stories you know people try to go pray
[1:13:06] for someone that's demon possessed and
[1:13:07] then it goes bad cuz God didn't tell
[1:13:10] them to do that right see we're
[1:13:11] harnessed to the will of the father you
[1:13:14] have to pray for
[1:13:16] everybody for one you can't you don't
[1:13:19] you don't have the mental faculty those
[1:13:21] main people all those twisted and
[1:13:23] Afflicted and blind suffering bunch of
[1:13:25] humanity laying there half starved to
[1:13:27] death naked waiting for that full of
[1:13:29] mercy and compassion walked right
[1:13:32] through every one of them and walked
[1:13:34] over to a man laying on a pallet that
[1:13:36] had some kind of an infirmity he had it
[1:13:38] 38 years perhaps sugar diabetes or
[1:13:41] tricular it was
[1:13:43] I don't know what he's what
[1:13:45] that's saying there but walked over to
[1:13:47] that man so in other words this man it
[1:13:49] wasn't
[1:13:50] life-threatening and we look at that and
[1:13:52] we say now listen we need to order the
[1:13:55] sicknesses by
[1:13:57] severity and pick the worst one you know
[1:14:00] God says look you know God speaks to
[1:14:02] your heart says you're going to go to
[1:14:03] the P of Bethesda you're going to pray
[1:14:04] for one person that's what we would do
[1:14:06] say okay give me a list we'll pray for
[1:14:08] the worst case God's like no come on
[1:14:11] down the let's pray for this
[1:14:13] man why we don't need to know why that's
[1:14:17] right we don't need to know why I'm
[1:14:19] going to I'm going to pause this quote
[1:14:21] I'm going to jump and I'm going to read
[1:14:24] to explain why don't need to know why
[1:14:26] trying to do God a service without being
[1:14:28] the will of God now think real hard and
[1:14:31] watch what the denomination has done
[1:14:32] today see they've turned it down called
[1:14:34] it false Doctrine see look where they're
[1:14:36] at they'll get their ecumenical counsel
[1:14:38] all right called it mental telepathy
[1:14:40] what when God himself vindicating it to
[1:14:42] be the truth and proving it's the truth
[1:14:45] oh they're just a little bunch of
[1:14:46] nitwits out there they say don't know
[1:14:48] what they're talking about that's right
[1:14:50] we
[1:14:51] don't but we just say his words and he
[1:14:54] knows what he's talking about see I
[1:14:57] can't explain it nobody else can but he
[1:14:59] proves it amen so we don't need to know
[1:15:01] why he said it so we say it too
[1:15:04] amen that's when you're really harnessed
[1:15:06] to the will of the
[1:15:10] father now back to that
[1:15:13] quote paragraph 29 now let's take that
[1:15:17] being Chicago tonight and say sitting
[1:15:19] along here would be a whole
[1:15:20] maybe 20 or 30 or 40 Wheelchairs and
[1:15:24] some critic would come in and in the
[1:15:26] meeting and say look let me see these
[1:15:28] the those people who believe that Jesus
[1:15:30] Christ is the same yesterday today and
[1:15:36] forever and they claim that Congressman
[1:15:38] Upshaw and all these people that's has
[1:15:40] that's been healed and we've heard all
[1:15:41] these testimonies of the lame Halt and
[1:15:43] short legs made long and the dead raised
[1:15:45] up the doctor statements of it and so
[1:15:47] forth like that let me see them walk
[1:15:49] down and make them well now that will be
[1:15:51] the same spirit that was on them people
[1:15:54] in that day
[1:15:56] right so here's Jesus's opportunity
[1:15:58] right big day everybody's
[1:16:00] watching they've heard all the rumors
[1:16:03] what's he going to do well history says
[1:16:06] he he'll go in there and heal everybody
[1:16:07] else he heals the man who who's fine
[1:16:10] he's sick but he's fine he's not going
[1:16:12] to die and he walks out everyone says
[1:16:14] well yeah we knew it it was all a
[1:16:19] hoax cuz they God's God is not a
[1:16:25] magician he's not a sideshow
[1:16:30] right tell us who hit you not a word was
[1:16:34] spoken you see it it's nothing to do
[1:16:38] with he didn't even use the power that
[1:16:40] God gave him to prove God Amen you say
[1:16:44] well brother just said he proves it yeah
[1:16:46] he proved it by keeping his mouth shut
[1:16:49] he proved it by only healing the one man
[1:16:51] he proved it by going to Calvary and
[1:16:53] Rising again and he didn't go around and
[1:16:55] tell everybody see look I'm alive I
[1:16:56] really am here no he just went to his
[1:16:59] people he went to the elect of God he
[1:17:01] didn't run to to to Herod and and and
[1:17:03] and um pilot and everybody else and say
[1:17:07] no no no it's not a hoax I'm alive no he
[1:17:10] didn't do that because it doesn't matter
[1:17:12] they don't matter only the child
[1:17:15] children of God matter only the Eagles
[1:17:17] matter we don't know who's Eagles so we
[1:17:19] just we try for everybody but God knows
[1:17:23] so God comes to you and says look do
[1:17:25] this you just do you don't ask why you
[1:17:27] you do it you listen to what he says you
[1:17:28] be obedient because you're a child of
[1:17:31] God and that's maturity that's right
[1:17:35] that's maturity you know we we're at
[1:17:37] that stage in in our life and and bless
[1:17:39] my my kids if they're listening and
[1:17:41] they're catching what I'm saying we're
[1:17:43] you know we're getting some arguments
[1:17:45] back you know so well what about you
[1:17:47] know do this well I
[1:17:50] don't no when Dad says do something you
[1:17:53] just say yes sir and you do it you don't
[1:17:54] argue with me you don't have that
[1:17:56] position and there's consequences and
[1:17:59] then you know I'm sorry but that's what
[1:18:01] God does to us he says do this and we
[1:18:02] want to argue and say well Lord no I
[1:18:04] really think you ought to do it this way
[1:18:05] and guess what we do we go and do it
[1:18:07] that way and he says great how is it
[1:18:09] talking to a donkey
[1:18:12] yeah balum right look where he ended up
[1:18:16] and he was murdered in the the Armen but
[1:18:19] Bam's not a child of
[1:18:20] God he wouldn't have acted like that if
[1:18:22] he was but you see
[1:18:26] or I don't want to make that statement
[1:18:27] you know whatever balam is in the hands
[1:18:29] of the Lord but he received judgment for
[1:18:30] how he behaved so the same thing we we
[1:18:33] God tells us to do something and and we
[1:18:36] want to argue with it why
[1:18:39] because because of the flesh when I
[1:18:41] would do good evil is present with me
[1:18:43] and it's because we have character flaws
[1:18:46] I think it's really healthy every day to
[1:18:47] look at yourself in the mirror not in a
[1:18:49] self-destructing way because we should
[1:18:51] have humble confidence but in a
[1:18:55] real with yourself kind of way look in
[1:18:57] the mirror and says look you got a lot
[1:18:59] to learn because whenever we start to
[1:19:01] think we got it figured out man that's
[1:19:04] when we're the most arrogant the most
[1:19:06] annoying and the most hardest to deal
[1:19:09] with when we think we got it figured out
[1:19:11] every in church is like you can't tell
[1:19:13] that guy anything I can't I mean just
[1:19:15] it's so complicated it just doesn't work
[1:19:17] out you know that's why God gave us gave
[1:19:20] us wives they're are mirrors and
[1:19:23] children
[1:19:29] oh come
[1:19:36] on so he says let's take that in Chicago
[1:19:40] tonight say sitting along here would be
[1:19:42] a whole maybe 20 or or or 30 or 40
[1:19:46] Wheelchairs and some critic would come
[1:19:47] in the meeting say look let me see these
[1:19:49] people you know make this claim let me
[1:19:51] let me see you show me show show what
[1:19:53] happen so that Jesus is the same
[1:19:55] I'm paraphrasing because I realize I'm
[1:19:56] further down to the quote let me see
[1:19:58] them walk down and make them well now
[1:20:00] that would be the same Spirit was on
[1:20:02] them people in that day they wanted to
[1:20:03] know the same thing how could this man
[1:20:05] walk by there full of love full of
[1:20:07] compassion and leave all those people
[1:20:09] lay there how could he do it now God in
[1:20:12] his infinite wisdom and Grace tells us
[1:20:14] why in this point in time he says now
[1:20:17] Jesus answers them in John 5:19 which we
[1:20:20] read he said verily verily I say unto
[1:20:22] you the son of the son can do nothing in
[1:20:24] himself but what he sees the father
[1:20:26] doing that doeth the son likewise is
[1:20:29] that right if that was Jesus yesterday
[1:20:31] that's Jesus today you do nothing except
[1:20:34] God shows first what to do now Jesus
[1:20:37] plainly said he did nothing except the
[1:20:39] father showed him that's
[1:20:43] right now in hear ye him 1958 but now
[1:20:47] notice in my father's house he was
[1:20:50] strictly with the Bible I I just I I
[1:20:52] don't know you read quotes sometimes in
[1:20:54] these phrases pop out like the
[1:20:55] invitation to mold your character and
[1:20:58] and this part just really pops out to me
[1:21:00] he was strictly with the Bible that's
[1:21:02] right you know in in the programming
[1:21:03] world we we use this we use software
[1:21:06] kind of like word right like you're
[1:21:07] going to write a document in Word we use
[1:21:09] something very similar it's called an
[1:21:11] IDE and we have we have software that's
[1:21:14] loaded into that program that can then
[1:21:17] keep us writing good code because you
[1:21:20] can write whatever you want but then
[1:21:22] when it ships then that's when you see
[1:21:24] the problem so we have these safeguards
[1:21:25] in place and there's a Mode called
[1:21:27] strict mode and when you put it in
[1:21:29] strict mode your editor as we call it
[1:21:32] gets all these red squiggly lines under
[1:21:34] every function you can imagine that
[1:21:36] you've written because it's not good
[1:21:38] enough because it's strict mode so you
[1:21:41] know what we do we turn off strict
[1:21:43] mode because there's only certain
[1:21:46] situations where strict mode can
[1:21:47] actually
[1:21:48] work you have to start it right and you
[1:21:51] got to finish it right and you got to
[1:21:52] work through it correctly and it takes a
[1:21:53] lot of time
[1:21:55] but you'll never have a problem with it
[1:21:58] so mankind says well we'll just turn
[1:21:59] that off mankind says well Bible you
[1:22:03] know got to grow your hair and wear n
[1:22:06] it's too hard we'll just turn strict
[1:22:09] mode off no he says he says he was
[1:22:13] strictly with the Bible that's right so
[1:22:17] if the Bible said it he did it why
[1:22:20] because it was his own
[1:22:21] words so you says wow maybe you feel
[1:22:24] like like it's too impossible get the
[1:22:26] spirit and the mind of Christ inside of
[1:22:27] you and suddenly you'll just do
[1:22:30] it I went from working in a place where
[1:22:33] we didn't do any testing and I came to
[1:22:35] where I work now and it was like oh my
[1:22:37] goodness testing and we had to have all
[1:22:39] this extra stuff to be closer to strict
[1:22:41] mode and it was a pain and I was
[1:22:43] frustrated but now it's just what I do
[1:22:46] right it's just part of my everyday work
[1:22:48] I don't even to think about
[1:22:50] it God does the same thing with you he
[1:22:52] takes you and just you're you're
[1:22:53] frustrated and and you're you're frally
[1:22:55] with yourself you see how you're falling
[1:22:57] short but then you just keep applying
[1:22:59] the word of God because there's a balm
[1:23:00] in Gilead as the Bible says you just
[1:23:02] keep applying the word of God and you
[1:23:03] keep going to church and all of a sudden
[1:23:05] you realize I'm not the man I used to be
[1:23:08] that's right tell me tell me tell me the
[1:23:10] Magic in that tell me the the boom and
[1:23:13] the drama in that no it's it's it's just
[1:23:16] a Son of
[1:23:17] God living God's word but it's not just
[1:23:22] that is a miracle amen amen he was
[1:23:25] strictly with the Bible back in the Old
[1:23:27] Testament when a father owned a big
[1:23:29] Kingdom and a child was born into that
[1:23:30] Kingdom he was a son as soon as he was
[1:23:32] born but yet that son he would be heir
[1:23:36] of all the father had if his character
[1:23:39] was right that's that's it but first his
[1:23:41] character had to be
[1:23:44] proved now you ministers know where I'm
[1:23:47] going to it's the placing of a son now
[1:23:50] but his character didn't show up right
[1:23:52] he didn't inherit
[1:23:55] anything he was just a son amen so then
[1:23:59] the father in order to get this great
[1:24:01] son of his who he loved he had a he had
[1:24:03] business to be doing so he got a tutor
[1:24:06] trainer over his children and he sought
[1:24:08] through the places till he found the
[1:24:10] best man he could find because his son's
[1:24:13] education and the future of his son
[1:24:15] depended on what kind of a training that
[1:24:18] child got there's some good family
[1:24:20] teaching right there that's the way it
[1:24:22] is today in the Kingdom of God that when
[1:24:25] we're born in the kingdom of God God
[1:24:27] sought out the best tutor that he could
[1:24:29] find for the church and that was the
[1:24:31] Holy Spirit that's right so you see it's
[1:24:34] our benefit when we stick with God's
[1:24:37] will yeah that's right because we're
[1:24:41] getting better because we're there with
[1:24:44] the Holy Spirit which is the teacher
[1:24:46] yeah so the sooner we can surrender what
[1:24:49] we want and do what God's want God wants
[1:24:52] it's actually you're going to be
[1:24:55] happier the the the the the barebones
[1:24:57] example of that is somebody living in
[1:24:59] the world and you look at them you think
[1:25:01] if you would just surrender to God your
[1:25:03] life would be incredible compared to
[1:25:05] what it is right
[1:25:07] now because I I think sometimes you see
[1:25:09] somebody like that I think they're a
[1:25:10] child of God that's why it just doesn't
[1:25:12] work out there for them just everything
[1:25:14] goes wrong because some people who live
[1:25:16] you know good successful lives but and
[1:25:20] so you just say well you it be easier I
[1:25:22] mean you fight battles right you fight
[1:25:24] fight
[1:25:25] battles but the peace the rest right I
[1:25:30] was just reading today in my studies and
[1:25:31] brother talking about how denominations
[1:25:34] or something along those lines ministers
[1:25:36] so forth painting being a Christian like
[1:25:38] it's some um you know strenuous and like
[1:25:43] oh you got to just try to be a good
[1:25:45] Christian he says no it's rest that's
[1:25:47] right it's
[1:25:51] rest and and identification one more
[1:25:54] quote here and then we're going to
[1:25:56] close he says where would you be
[1:25:59] identified at that time well I say that
[1:26:01] but we have a whole quote so we never
[1:26:02] know where would you be identified at
[1:26:04] that time now with your character that's
[1:26:06] molded in you now now this is this is uh
[1:26:09] what is it called pause right now this
[1:26:12] moment at uh 8:56 right here your
[1:26:17] character okay that's what we're looking
[1:26:18] at not your character in a few years not
[1:26:20] your character tomorrow WR this second
[1:26:23] right he says that character that's
[1:26:25] something in you something's molded your
[1:26:27] character you're some kind of a
[1:26:29] character and that's more true for some
[1:26:31] of us you're going to find yourself
[1:26:33] somewhere here what would you have done
[1:26:36] so your character right now what would
[1:26:38] you have done what in your present State
[1:26:40] now he's going to get to what we're
[1:26:41] talking about here where would you have
[1:26:43] been at that time see teachers all
[1:26:45] against him and everything and his
[1:26:47] miracles identified him you see so the
[1:26:50] identification was present and was
[1:26:53] obvious right but all they could think
[1:26:56] about was how he was disrupting their
[1:26:58] well oiled
[1:27:00] machine he was dropping bolts in their
[1:27:07] flywheels because they needed to rebuild
[1:27:10] the
[1:27:12] engine so he says where would you have
[1:27:14] been his and his miracles identified him
[1:27:17] and when the 70 got up and the pastors
[1:27:19] and the ministers and got up and said we
[1:27:21] can't understand that would you have
[1:27:23] walked away like that
[1:27:24] congregation or would you have been like
[1:27:26] them disciples I don't care what they
[1:27:28] say it's there then Jesus turned and
[1:27:31] gave them trials see he just he just
[1:27:35] turns it up a notch right he gets rid of
[1:27:38] it that's what was happening with Gideon
[1:27:40] right that was the type there in
[1:27:43] Gideon God just kept turning up the
[1:27:45] notch because the real child of go
[1:27:47] children of God they don't crack under
[1:27:49] the
[1:27:50] pressure they mold under the pressure
[1:27:52] right because it's the fire right the
[1:27:54] gold doesn't go away everything else
[1:27:56] goes away but the gold just gets hotter
[1:27:59] and hotter and then just just just soup
[1:28:01] how hot do you want to take it it's
[1:28:03] there everything else Burns and Falls
[1:28:05] away but the gold stays so God has to
[1:28:07] turn the temperature up so you think
[1:28:09] it's bad right
[1:28:10] now he says can understand that would
[1:28:12] you have walked away like
[1:28:15] okay then Jesus turned and gave them
[1:28:17] trial said do you all want to go too see
[1:28:20] they had caught they had him caught in a
[1:28:22] trap why this man's a vampire said we
[1:28:25] have to eat his flesh and blood they
[1:28:26] walked away the congregation well the
[1:28:28] ministers say well we we'll say we'll
[1:28:31] stay a little while longer and see what
[1:28:33] it's all about see so they didn't go in
[1:28:35] his in this story he's sharing we're
[1:28:37] going to say and see what he has to say
[1:28:39] and he said now when you see the son of
[1:28:41] man identifying himself as God now and
[1:28:43] saints of God that's always the point
[1:28:46] when you lose them that's the point when
[1:28:48] the draw falls out is when God ENT why
[1:28:51] okay praise God why is it the point when
[1:28:54] God identifies himself why is that when
[1:28:56] everyone separates because he can see
[1:28:59] himself in the
[1:29:01] gold so nothing else can be there that's
[1:29:04] why they separated oh no they separated
[1:29:06] no that's a good sign that means God's
[1:29:08] looking at
[1:29:10] himself right because there's nothing to
[1:29:12] Mar the image now so he turns and says
[1:29:14] look I'm
[1:29:16] God when you see the son of man lifting
[1:29:19] up into heaven from where he come from
[1:29:20] oh they said this is too much for us and
[1:29:24] off they went then he turned to the
[1:29:26] disciples and said you want to go too he
[1:29:29] didn't turn to them and say you guys
[1:29:30] going to stick with me he says look you
[1:29:32] should leave
[1:29:34] too and they
[1:29:39] said Lord where are we going to go yeah
[1:29:44] amen Lord who would we go that's right
[1:29:49] where could we go we know that you and
[1:29:52] you alone have has the words of
[1:29:57] life I mean what what a position to be
[1:30:00] in amen when you look I mean just put
[1:30:04] yourself there for a minute you're
[1:30:05] looking Christ himself in the face eye
[1:30:08] to eye and he learns at you and says are
[1:30:11] you going to leave me too
[1:30:14] right and you see it wasn't it wasn't
[1:30:17] his look alone to hold them it wasn't
[1:30:19] his features alone to hold them because
[1:30:21] he had no features were a mini would
[1:30:24] desire
[1:30:26] him he and he made himself of no
[1:30:29] reputation so the man those who knew him
[1:30:33] in passing didn't understand him the man
[1:30:35] there was nothing to want you to say I
[1:30:37] want to follow that guy it had to be
[1:30:40] that way because otherwise it wouldn't
[1:30:42] have worked because it has to be the
[1:30:45] words of life so why do you follow the
[1:30:48] message because your parents
[1:30:52] do
[1:30:54] because you just grew up in it and you
[1:30:56] married a girl who grew up in it
[1:30:58] too why do you come to church because
[1:31:01] it's all you know and it's a nice
[1:31:03] community and SS of God we are coming to
[1:31:06] the point where God's going to start
[1:31:07] looking at you in the face and say are
[1:31:09] you going to go too that's it because
[1:31:11] you can't be in the way if you're not in
[1:31:14] either you're in or you're not that's
[1:31:16] right and we're at that point in time
[1:31:18] where the Lord's like look I don't got
[1:31:19] any room on the bench that's right I
[1:31:22] need I need players in the
[1:31:25] game and I and I need you to stand the
[1:31:27] test of time it's like in the in in the
[1:31:29] in the in in the if I can have the
[1:31:31] Liberty to be a bit a bit loose in The
[1:31:34] Game of
[1:31:35] Life there's just enough players on
[1:31:38] God's team that's right oh the devil's
[1:31:41] got droves of them the bench is full
[1:31:43] he's got fresh Replacements but you got
[1:31:46] to tow the line ining in and ining
[1:31:50] out quarter in and quarter out you have
[1:31:53] to be there Towing the line there is no
[1:31:56] break because as soon as you break the
[1:31:58] devil says I own the bench so are you on
[1:32:00] my
[1:32:01] team
[1:32:03] right now a bit more serious God has
[1:32:07] called us to something amen why would we
[1:32:09] want to fail him why would we want to
[1:32:11] back up and give up and and
[1:32:16] uh the only
[1:32:18] way the only way is eat the
[1:32:22] book you know what until the end of time
[1:32:26] we will preach the same thing over and
[1:32:28] over again that's right eat the booken
[1:32:31] every sermon comes back to that whether
[1:32:34] you realize it or not it comes back to
[1:32:35] the same thing eat the
[1:32:37] book it's the same thing like Noah right
[1:32:40] as in the days of Noah so shall it be
[1:32:41] the coming of the son of man Noah said
[1:32:43] it's going to
[1:32:44] rain and we're saying eat the book same
[1:32:48] message so Noah brought it from
[1:32:49] different angles 400 years of preaching
[1:32:51] he refined his ability to bring bring it
[1:32:54] from different angles and show Enoch
[1:32:56] this and and Methuselah's name this and
[1:32:57] all of this kind of stuff right Noah
[1:32:59] brought it but it all ended the same
[1:33:00] thing it's going to rain amen same is in
[1:33:04] the world that we live in today eat the
[1:33:06] book you want to be like God be like
[1:33:08] Christ eat the book but you got to pray
[1:33:11] too that's you got to pray too you got
[1:33:13] to serve God you got to have a
[1:33:14] relationship with God and none of us can
[1:33:17] make you have a relationship with God
[1:33:19] and those that are serving God Don't
[1:33:22] Stop Get Down down deep grain and say
[1:33:25] God what are the little things I am
[1:33:26] holding on to what are the little Prides
[1:33:28] that I'm holding on to those that have
[1:33:31] been serving God and they're dedicated
[1:33:32] to serving
[1:33:33] God we're still here so obviously you
[1:33:36] have something to change and I have
[1:33:38] something to change so God show me show
[1:33:41] let me see when my pride takes control
[1:33:43] let me see when my my you know my
[1:33:47] Temperance is out and I'm not fulfilling
[1:33:49] the fruits of the spirit Lord help me to
[1:33:50] see that and Lord help me not to do it
[1:33:52] again next time that's right give me the
[1:33:54] strength to say say
[1:33:56] no no give me the strength to have
[1:34:00] joy give me the strength to have joy yes
[1:34:03] that's that's I've been thinking about
[1:34:05] it a lot lately I know I said I would
[1:34:06] close but Lord I need to I Joy is part
[1:34:10] of what Joy is part of the fruits of the
[1:34:12] spirit amen so if I'm being longf faced
[1:34:15] guess what I'm not being a good witness
[1:34:17] of
[1:34:19] Christ we're not Martyrs okay we are
[1:34:22] Sons and Daughters of God we should have
[1:34:23] have joy in our lives you think the
[1:34:25] martyrs looked like they were sad to die
[1:34:27] no they were praising God they were
[1:34:30] praising God and they had to give their
[1:34:31] literal lives you have to give your
[1:34:33] spiritual life you have to surrender
[1:34:35] your flesh to God Amen and die out
[1:34:38] completely to him let's bow our heads
[1:34:40] Heavenly Father Lord
[1:34:42] Jesus
[1:34:44] Lord if we if we look at it through the
[1:34:47] flesh it's a big
[1:34:50] mountain it's a big pyramid actually and
[1:34:53] if and if we look and say well well it's
[1:34:55] too hard to climb well it
[1:34:58] is but if if we look into your word and
[1:35:01] we say God show us the next step to take
[1:35:04] then we look back and we see how we gain
[1:35:06] some
[1:35:06] elevation up the statue of a perfect
[1:35:09] man Lord remind us keep us focused that
[1:35:13] we can we can look and we can say Lord

[1:35:22] situation and there's an argument
[1:35:24] between the husband and wife may there
[1:35:25] be a pause say let's pray before we
[1:35:28] continue let's seek the father's will in
[1:35:30] in everything we

[1:35:40] see you in the skies and meeting in the
[1:35:42] air and we want to come over but Lord
