[38:47] may god bless you all let's just greet
[38:49] our brother yannick
[38:50] god bless you amen
[38:58] you know i just remember a couple years
[39:01] ago
[39:01] my sister jerry and i was courting and
[39:04] those things of our life she only lived
[39:06] about four hours away
[39:07] not continents and i couldn't wait to
[39:10] see her i couldn't wait to talk to her
[39:12] so i can only imagine
[39:14] what you guys have experienced but god
[39:17] is rich in mercy amen he is gracious to
[39:20] us
[39:21] and we are so happy to have you here
[39:23] with us brother
[39:25] i pray god's blessing on you
[39:28] in all that you lay your hand to
[39:31] amen you know every time that god opens
[39:35] a door my brother and sister and we move
[39:37] through that doorway
[39:38] god's got something for us a blessing
[39:41] that he's
[39:42] he's got for us and so we're happy good
[39:44] to see each and every one of you today i
[39:46] just pray
[39:47] lord just stir your hearts and we just
[39:50] look forward to the word
[39:52] amen i want to speak to you once again
[39:54] on redemption's manifestation
[39:57] i i know that i have veered very far
[40:00] from uh where we started in this series
[40:04] of redemptions manifestation but
[40:06] um i promise you we will get back to it
[40:10] i just have to deal with this little
[40:12] thought we're talking about the tale of
[40:14] two queens
[40:15] and as we look at this story my brother
[40:17] and sister we
[40:19] realize it does tie together with
[40:22] our thought of those sold out to christ
[40:25] and those sold out to the world
[40:27] and those who are straddling the fence
[40:30] and
[40:31] we look at this and realize that for
[40:34] every counterfeit as the prophet of god
[40:37] very
[40:38] very lovingly made that that uh uh
[40:41] point to us for every counterfeit there
[40:43] has to be
[40:45] the original the real and aren't you
[40:48] glad of that
[40:49] because today um i just seems like
[40:53] there's a lot of counterfeit brother
[40:55] isaac i don't know if it's just
[40:57] up here but i seem like to have a lot of
[40:59] feedback
[41:01] so we look at this and realize that if
[41:04] we're not careful we just start looking
[41:05] at the counterfeit
[41:07] and uh in that we start to judge
[41:09] everything by the counterfeit
[41:12] i was just talking to an individual a
[41:14] few days ago
[41:15] and he made a statement about
[41:20] how it just seemed like everywhere you
[41:22] go this man
[41:25] did this and this and this and he claims
[41:26] to be a christian
[41:29] and it opened a door an opportunity we
[41:31] can talk to them and say look it's not
[41:34] about the name
[41:35] it's about the life and
[41:38] so anyone can bear any name but we want
[41:41] to bear the life
[41:43] and when we bear the life the name will
[41:46] stand out
[41:47] and so we're thankful that god is is uh
[41:51] being so gracious to us in our lives
[41:53] that
[41:54] uh we will come and and i'll touch upon
[41:57] this a little further in this service
[41:59] uh but we uh recognize that
[42:03] we as the bride of christ we don't walk
[42:06] around
[42:07] talking in the language of i'm the queen
[42:10] of heaven
[42:11] you see the title comes with the
[42:14] position we don't
[42:16] seek the title we seek the position
[42:20] amen and so it's there that we don't
[42:23] need boasting rights
[42:24] we don't need to be able to vocalize to
[42:28] the world
[42:29] because as we have all experienced i'm
[42:31] sure in our lives
[42:33] the the times that we have come
[42:36] it doesn't matter what you're talking
[42:38] about i remember many years ago i hired
[42:40] a man to work for me
[42:42] and um he uh he said oh yeah
[42:46] i've i've driven a tractor many times
[42:49] and i said okay that's fine we put him
[42:50] to work
[42:52] and i walk out one morning and he's out
[42:53] there without the clutch pushed in
[42:55] trying to stick the tractor in gear and
[42:58] i realized at that time
[43:00] anyone can say but it's the actual
[43:05] life or the action that
[43:08] proves whether there's something there
[43:10] or not so amen
[43:12] we don't know as i said telling the
[43:15] world we're the queen of heaven
[43:17] but you'll find this many member body
[43:19] that our lord jesus christ calls
[43:22] the wife the bride amen
[43:25] we can claim that position i am the
[43:28] bride
[43:29] of jesus christ amen let's just stand as
[43:32] we'll go into the word today taking this
[43:34] out a little fundamentals we'll take out
[43:37] of the book of esther the second chapter
[43:40] and while we're not touching on every
[43:41] component uh
[43:43] every part of these uh this story uh
[43:46] we're
[43:46] wanting and desiring and i pray by god's
[43:49] grace we actually can accomplish
[43:51] to bring the parallels to bring the
[43:53] picture
[43:54] because you see my brother and sister
[43:56] everything
[43:57] that has happened the scripture says
[44:00] will happen again
[44:01] nothing new under the sun right
[44:05] so with nothing new under the sun we
[44:08] find ourselves realizing
[44:10] that what is taking place today has
[44:13] already
[44:14] taken place so we can find the parallels
[44:17] all through this scripture that
[44:22] match the day we live in so
[44:25] you wonder what's next what's in store
[44:27] what's happening
[44:29] get into your bible start reading start
[44:32] studying listen to what the prophet said
[44:35] about the times the seasons the places
[44:38] and my brother and sister we won't run
[44:40] around perplexed we won't run around
[44:42] afraid we won't run around with these
[44:44] giant question marks
[44:46] and and i just say this i don't say this
[44:48] critically but when you talk
[44:50] to people talk to them on the telephone
[44:52] whatever they've called brother paul i
[44:53] have questions about this this this and
[44:56] this
[44:56] my brother and sister often times now i
[44:58] don't want to sound harsh here
[45:00] but you can tell whether or not they've
[45:02] been in their bible or not
[45:04] you can tell whether they've been
[45:05] studying the message or not
[45:08] because the answers are there the
[45:10] prophet of god said
[45:11] the bible explains it all
[45:15] so when we come into this time that we
[45:17] say i just don't know i don't know i've
[45:19] got the questions i'm nervous i've just
[45:21] get in your bible start reading start
[45:24] praying asking for revelation right did
[45:26] the prophet of god not say to pray for
[45:28] revelation
[45:30] so you pray for revelation you get into
[45:32] the word
[45:33] many of our little things that have us
[45:36] shook up
[45:36] will fade away amen that's god's promise
[45:40] to us
[45:41] esther the second chapter starting with
[45:44] verse
[45:44] 7. and he brought up hadassah
[45:48] that is esther his uncle's daughter for
[45:51] she had neither
[45:52] father nor mother and the maid was fair
[45:55] and beautiful
[45:56] who mordecai when her father and mother
[45:58] were dead took for his own daughter
[46:00] so it came to pass when the king's
[46:02] commandment and his decree was heard
[46:05] and when many maidens were gathered
[46:07] together unto shuchan the palace
[46:09] to the custody of haggai that esther was
[46:12] brought also into the king's house
[46:14] to the custody of haggai the keeper of
[46:16] the women
[46:17] and the maiden pleased him my right from
[46:20] the very beginning
[46:21] look what's happening oh and by the way
[46:23] those of you that thought he
[46:24] mispronounced that
[46:26] i just read a quote this morning where
[46:27] brother branham said now he might not
[46:29] have much education he might not be able
[46:31] to pronounce those names
[46:32] in the bible correctly
[46:36] and the world will measure that by
[46:37] whether that's truth or not
[46:41] but we measure the truth by god in his
[46:44] word
[46:45] amen so it just those of you that
[46:47] thought he mispronounced that
[46:49] praise the lord i got a quote now i was
[46:52] like thank you lord
[46:53] thank you lord amen so it came to pass
[46:57] when the king's commandment his decree
[46:58] was heard when many maidens were
[47:00] gathered together
[47:01] so look at this i wanted to just this is
[47:03] not really my point this morning but i
[47:04] want you to
[47:05] catch this my brother and sister you
[47:08] talk about an
[47:09] act of faith or anointing that mordecai
[47:12] haven't taken this child and raised it
[47:16] as his own in other words i believe that
[47:19] his love would then have
[47:20] just as solid as it had been his very
[47:23] child
[47:24] and he's raised it up but now anointed
[47:27] to release her into this now when you
[47:30] think about this
[47:32] when a young woman went to uh try out to
[47:35] be the queen
[47:36] she never came back
[47:41] she didn't come back and go ahead and
[47:42] marry that other childhood friend
[47:45] she never came back my this took an act
[47:53] of faith
[47:54] there had to have been something
[47:55] anointing mordecai
[47:57] to say you know what we're going to send
[48:00] you up there
[48:02] i mean it would be a good secure thing
[48:06] for
[48:07] a young lady but what man would wish
[48:09] that his daughter
[48:11] would just go away and become a
[48:14] concubine
[48:16] maybe to know the king and maybe not to
[48:20] never really have a life
[48:21] of freedom whatever this is an act of
[48:24] faith saints
[48:25] and i want to put it right here just in
[48:26] case i miss it somewhere else in the
[48:28] service
[48:29] when we as sons and daughters of god
[48:31] give our heart to jesus christ
[48:34] truly give our heart to jesus christ i'm
[48:37] not talking about a religious spirit
[48:40] i'm talking about truly give our heart
[48:42] to jesus christ
[48:44] we are forever his captive there
[48:47] is no going back
[48:51] now many people say well i i served god
[48:54] for many years and got discouraged and i
[48:56] went back
[48:56] my brother and sister they never fully
[48:58] gave their heart
[49:00] they always held that little portion
[49:02] back just in case
[49:03] this message doesn't work
[49:07] well hallelujah we don't need
[49:10] to have it just in case amen
[49:13] we're sold out hallelujah
[49:21] and the maiden pleased him and she
[49:23] obtained kindness of him and he speedily
[49:26] gave her
[49:27] things for to do what was just my
[49:29] brother and sister and fair we'd all go
[49:31] to hell
[49:33] aren't you glad we can have favoritism
[49:35] in the eyes of the king
[49:37] amen that he would come and say you know
[49:39] what i'll give you the best place
[49:41] in my house i give you of the best
[49:44] things and i do it speedily
[49:46] i i don't do it with any remorse i don't
[49:49] do it with any
[49:50] restraint but give it freely and
[49:53] speedily to you
[49:55] amen esther had not showed her people
[49:58] nor her kindred for mordecai had charged
[50:00] her
[50:00] that she should not show it my i just
[50:03] want to preach this whole scripture to
[50:04] you but
[50:05] you're all standing amen mordecai walked
[50:08] every day before the court of the
[50:09] women's house to know how esther did and
[50:12] what should become of her
[50:14] this you might see is a little nervous
[50:16] twitch of a father
[50:20] and now whenever maid's turn was come to
[50:21] go into the king of hazarus
[50:23] after that she had been 12 months
[50:25] according to the manner of the women
[50:27] for so were the days of their
[50:29] purification accomplished to wait
[50:31] six months with oil of myrrh six months
[50:33] with sweet odors and with
[50:35] other things for the purifying of the
[50:37] women
[50:38] then thus came every maiden and to the
[50:41] king
[50:41] whatsoever she desired was given to her
[50:45] to go with her out of the house of the
[50:47] women
[50:48] and to the king's house i i can't help
[50:50] but just
[50:51] comment on this everything oh saints
[50:54] listen
[50:55] everything you desire
[50:59] to take with you to the king
[51:03] is given to you
[51:06] every good spiritual gift every blessing
[51:09] every divine promise everything that is
[51:12] there
[51:13] is yours to take we don't have to go
[51:16] before the king
[51:17] empty-handed
[51:21] hallelujah i i'm afraid you're not
[51:24] catching the spiritual significance of
[51:26] this
[51:27] the prophet of god said we're living
[51:29] below our privilege it's right here
[51:31] to be given to us and we say well if god
[51:34] wants
[51:34] me to have it he would give it to me i'm
[51:36] sorry to tell you he has already given
[51:39] and we are there deeming ourselves
[51:42] unworthy or
[51:43] uncapable of taking what he's already
[51:46] given oh god help us have confidence
[51:50] people are like well i don't want to
[51:52] come i don't want to look like an
[51:53] arrogant christian well trust me if
[51:55] you're a son or daughter of god
[51:57] and you start to border on arrogance god
[52:00] will correct you
[52:01] otherwise give praise give glory give
[52:04] honor i
[52:05] am the bride of jesus christ
[52:08] exclamation mark period comma semicolon
[52:12] whatever you want to put it
[52:14] mode you have a smiling face emoji of
[52:16] hands clapping
[52:17] whatever it might be this is who you are
[52:21] hallelujah
[52:27] then thus come every maiden unto the
[52:28] king whatsoever she desired was given to
[52:30] her to go
[52:32] with her out of the house of the women
[52:33] into the king's house in the evening she
[52:35] went and on the morrow she returned
[52:37] into the second house of the women to
[52:40] the custody of shigaz
[52:41] the king's chamberlain which kept the
[52:44] concubines
[52:45] my brother and sister i don't think i
[52:47] need to explain to you what happened the
[52:48] king didn't sit down and drink tea with
[52:50] her
[52:51] i don't mean to be crass but he made
[52:52] love to her amen
[52:54] that's why they were forever bound to
[52:58] him
[53:00] she came in to the king no more except
[53:04] the king delighted in her
[53:06] and that she was called by name
[53:09] now when the turn of esther the daughter
[53:12] of abigail
[53:13] the uncle of mordecai who had taken her
[53:15] for his daughter
[53:17] was come to go into the king she
[53:19] required
[53:20] nothing but oh my goodness i hope you
[53:23] see these spiritual types that are
[53:24] hidden
[53:25] she required nothing but what god's
[53:28] provided place had
[53:29] already given her wait that's not the
[53:32] words is it let me let me get right back
[53:34] to the words here
[53:35] well haggai the king's chamberlain the
[53:37] keeper of the women
[53:38] appointed and esther obtained favor in
[53:41] the sight of all them that looked upon
[53:43] her so esther was taken into king a
[53:45] hazardous
[53:46] unto his house royal in the 10th month
[53:48] which was the
[53:49] month to beth in the seventh year of his
[53:52] reign
[53:53] and the king loved esther above all the
[53:56] women
[53:56] and she obtained grace and favor in his
[53:58] sight more than
[53:59] all the virgins so that he set the royal
[54:02] crown upon her head
[54:04] and made her queen instead of vashti
[54:08] heavenly father we just ask for your
[54:10] guiding hand today lord
[54:11] we ask father that you would speak lord
[54:14] let us speak only according to thy word
[54:16] we pray in the name of jesus christ
[54:18] amen you may be seated saints
[54:21] hallelujah i i have to admit i just
[54:24] as i look at this i see so many
[54:26] parallels i so many types i see so many
[54:29] things
[54:30] you know my brother and sister you see
[54:32] there's something special
[54:33] about the fact of not requiring nothing
[54:36] more
[54:37] than is already provided you know that
[54:39] is what's happened
[54:41] to many of the women right a type of the
[54:44] church
[54:44] that's happened to many of the women is
[54:47] they felt like they needed some other
[54:49] angle they needed something else that
[54:51] and had not been provided so they
[54:53] provided it for themselves
[54:54] and in fact we'll tie that in
[54:56] scripturally here in just a little bit
[54:58] you see god wants to give us more than
[55:01] just his name
[55:02] that's the problem we have in the
[55:04] denominational realm today is
[55:06] they're happy to just simply
[55:09] have the name but the bride of christ is
[55:11] not
[55:12] there to just settle for the name but
[55:14] she desires
[55:15] all amen as it were typed in the
[55:17] scripture to the half of the kingdom
[55:20] amen so we see now as we continue to
[55:22] look at this story of esther and vashti
[55:25] we see vashti has identified her nature
[55:28] was identified right here in isaiah 4
[55:32] 1 and so we see in that day seven women
[55:34] shall take hold of one man saying will
[55:36] we eat our own bread wear our own
[55:38] apparel only let us be called by thy
[55:40] name
[55:40] to take away our reproach so you see the
[55:43] very nature of vashti often times my
[55:46] brother and sister it's not what is said
[55:48] but the actions that go with it
[55:50] and avashti by nature really all she
[55:53] wanted was the name of the king she
[55:55] wanted to
[55:56] operate in her own realm in her own time
[55:59] and her own place but you see my brother
[56:02] and sister
[56:02] it's there that the prophet of god says
[56:04] one of the gifts that god would give to
[56:06] you and i
[56:07] is the fact that we could die out to
[56:10] ourself
[56:10] and completely surrender to christ so
[56:13] without a complete dying out of the
[56:15] nature
[56:16] we are not a new creature in christ
[56:18] jesus we're
[56:19] a old creature with a new covering or a
[56:22] new veneer
[56:23] and so this doesn't work and so as we
[56:26] look and see this
[56:27] old independent nature is still
[56:30] there it's still controlling the actions
[56:32] the thought process
[56:33] etc and saints don't misunderstand i'm
[56:36] not talking about the fact that we fight
[56:38] a war with his flesh
[56:40] that satan would desire to anoint his
[56:42] flesh and that we
[56:43] sometimes struggle and stumble and make
[56:45] mistakes that is not a desire
[56:48] that we have that is a a warfare in
[56:51] which
[56:52] we might be struck down as it were but
[56:54] raised up again
[56:55] by the hand of god and so it's there in
[56:58] this day-to-day struggle
[57:00] if our nature is opposed to any portion
[57:03] of the word of god
[57:05] the prophet of god said that that
[57:06] actually is an antichrist spirit
[57:09] when our spirit is opposed to the word
[57:13] so you see it's not just the day-to-day
[57:16] struggle but when we actually find
[57:18] ourselves
[57:18] opposed now a position of opposed my
[57:21] brother and sister is not that we're
[57:23] found in air has anyone been found in
[57:25] air i i've definitely been found in here
[57:27] so when we're found in air making
[57:30] mistakes
[57:31] and god comes and corrects us when we
[57:34] accept that correction that is not a
[57:37] spirit opposed to the word
[57:38] right so it's the one that says well we
[57:41] still believe it this way even though
[57:43] the word says different
[57:44] but let's just go right here to verse 2
[57:47] and see
[57:48] now right here now if you think i'm out
[57:50] on a limb
[57:51] amen you think i'm crazy don't bother me
[57:53] i'm kind of happy here
[57:55] but you know right here my brother and
[57:56] sister isaiah 4
[57:58] 1 fits very much the nature of vashti
[58:01] but 4
[58:01] 2 fits the nature of esther you look at
[58:04] this and see
[58:05] and in that day shall the branch of the
[58:07] lord be beautiful
[58:08] and glorious and the fruit of the earth
[58:10] shall be excellent and comely for them
[58:12] that are escaped of israel you see my
[58:16] brother and sister
[58:16] all through the scripture we find
[58:18] there's only one chosen place
[58:20] there's only one way of escape and that
[58:23] is in jesus christ so
[58:25] you get into christ and you then
[58:28] manifest what the word says
[58:30] and it says that the branch of the lord
[58:32] shall be beautiful and glorious
[58:34] amen we're not downtrodden we're not
[58:36] ugly we're not forgotten
[58:40] and we're not even our own
[58:44] we're the escaped of the world we live
[58:47] in
[58:49] now you say this is old testament
[58:52] brother paul
[58:53] but you see my brother and sister the
[58:55] new testament is merely the
[58:56] manifestation of the old testament
[58:59] and so it's there that we escape into
[59:01] christ
[59:02] amen we find ourselves then able
[59:06] to to uh redeem
[59:09] the time redeem the amen right after the
[59:13] earth goes poof and
[59:15] bursts into flames uh his mansion on the
[59:17] ocean
[59:18] his uh millions of dollars of exotic
[59:21] sports cars
[59:22] all his paper money all of his paper
[59:25] paper of bonds and stocks
[59:27] none of that my brother and sister is
[59:28] fire proof but i tell you what god's got
[59:31] a word
[59:32] that would come down into the heart of
[59:33] sons and daughters of god
[59:35] and it would make us not only walk
[59:37] through the natural fire and come out
[59:39] not smelling of the smoke
[59:40] but it will take us through the
[59:42] spiritual fire and bring us out
[59:44] victorious on the other side
[59:46] and the word says that we were called to
[59:48] rule and reign with him my brother and
[59:49] sister
[59:50] that's not of this earthly uh realm here
[59:53] that doesn't then realize
[59:54] how sacred the word is and the
[59:56] obligation of who you
[59:58] are is and that atmosphere was created
[1:00:01] and as she grows up comes to maturity
[1:00:05] in that atmosphere it tempered who she
[1:00:08] was
[1:00:09] we have a laxadaisical attitude towards
[1:00:12] the word of god
[1:00:14] to the house of god that is the kind of
[1:00:16] children
[1:00:17] we will raise if we have a sincere on
[1:00:21] fire
[1:00:21] serious relationship with god my brother
[1:00:24] and sister
[1:00:25] that will be the influence sets the
[1:00:27] atmosphere
[1:00:28] around us amen so you look at this and
[1:00:31] realize
[1:00:32] that esther why we say whoa that's
[1:00:34] terrible she's an orphan
[1:00:36] but you realize that esther is actually
[1:00:38] blessed
[1:00:40] to have been raised in the house of
[1:00:41] mordecai
[1:00:46] and we're blessed to be raised in the
[1:00:49] house of god
[1:00:50] our father amen
[1:00:53] it is not something to lament it is not
[1:00:56] something to say oh woe is me
[1:00:58] we have to go to church a couple times a
[1:01:00] week we have to do this we have to do
[1:01:02] that
[1:01:03] we ought to be thanking god setting an
[1:01:05] atmosphere
[1:01:07] thanking god that we are not caught up
[1:01:09] in just
[1:01:10] religious uh religiosity amen
[1:01:14] hallelujah now look at this for just a
[1:01:16] moment
[1:01:17] in my father's house i'm just pulling
[1:01:21] that little paraphrase out of the
[1:01:22] scripture
[1:01:23] in my father's house but not in the
[1:01:26] natural my brother and sister we're not
[1:01:28] looking to the natural
[1:01:30] my father's house it might be that you
[1:01:32] would be raised rich
[1:01:34] i i would imagine today there's many a
[1:01:36] child would say oh i would like to be
[1:01:38] bill gates's child they must have
[1:01:41] everything well
[1:01:43] they probably have most of everything
[1:01:45] but my brother and sister the man has a
[1:01:47] revelation that many of us
[1:01:48] don't and he limits his children's tv
[1:01:51] time and their phone time and their
[1:01:53] music
[1:01:54] and their friends he limits everything
[1:01:56] while he has one agenda for the world
[1:01:58] he has a revelation to understand that
[1:02:01] doesn't apply to his children
[1:02:04] we call that hypocrisy
[1:02:10] but nevertheless he recognizes the
[1:02:12] influence of the very thing he
[1:02:14] propagates
[1:02:15] he recognizes the influence is negative
[1:02:20] in my father's house but we're not
[1:02:22] wanting to deal with the natural
[1:02:24] in my father's house what are the
[1:02:26] spiritual my brother and sister
[1:02:28] in my father's house the angels and the
[1:02:31] cherubims
[1:02:32] are presents a holy fire is there in my
[1:02:34] father's house the presence of god the
[1:02:36] holy ghost
[1:02:37] dwells day and night moving freely
[1:02:40] in my father's house it doesn't matter
[1:02:42] what room i'm in
[1:02:44] i'm in his presence in my father's house
[1:02:46] i'm here not one
[1:02:48] day to be out of his blessing and
[1:02:49] another day to be in it
[1:02:51] but every day i'm in his house i'm in
[1:02:53] his blessing
[1:02:55] every day i'm in the house i'm in the
[1:02:57] word
[1:02:58] every day i'm in the house i'm in the
[1:03:00] life
[1:03:02] amen what it is to be in the father's
[1:03:04] house
[1:03:05] you see no matter what we do for our
[1:03:07] children
[1:03:09] children let me speak to you for a
[1:03:11] moment no matter what we would do for
[1:03:14] you your parents would do for you
[1:03:16] there comes the day that you will decide
[1:03:19] for yourself
[1:03:21] whose house you want to live in
[1:03:26] well let me tell you we're living in
[1:03:28] bible times
[1:03:30] don't go looking back like they had a
[1:03:32] cream puff
[1:03:34] they lived in an age that had spirits
[1:03:36] just like we live in an age with spirits
[1:03:39] and if you want your children to turn
[1:03:41] out right
[1:03:43] then we have to set the atmosphere for
[1:03:46] them to turn it right
[1:03:48] we can't just sit back and say well
[1:03:49] praise god if they're
[1:03:51] god's children he'll take care of them
[1:03:54] well i'm telling you what god will do
[1:03:56] god will take care of dad and mom
[1:03:58] first and then work on the children
[1:04:01] or worse yet he'll skip mom and dad
[1:04:04] and work on the children come on saints
[1:04:09] lord help us to set an atmosphere great
[1:04:11] tabernacle
[1:04:12] god help us send an atmosphere that
[1:04:15] leads our children to recognize
[1:04:18] god's will for their life amen
[1:04:22] you see esther was who she was i believe
[1:04:25] personally
[1:04:26] i won't call this doctor and i don't
[1:04:28] want to put it that way to you but
[1:04:29] esther was who she was because she was
[1:04:31] raised in an atmosphere
[1:04:35] you see there was a preparation in her
[1:04:37] life
[1:04:38] for a higher calling
[1:04:42] now i won't explain to this where this
[1:04:45] comes from
[1:04:46] it's not the exact wording i kind of
[1:04:48] tried to condense it down
[1:04:50] but you see my brother and sister the
[1:04:52] old self
[1:04:53] must be stripped away
[1:04:58] you know years ago i used to have a
[1:04:59] painting business done quite well at it
[1:05:03] anyway you see you don't just put new
[1:05:06] paint
[1:05:07] over old paint randomly because when the
[1:05:10] old paint lets go the new paint goes
[1:05:12] with it
[1:05:14] so if you expect it to last you have to
[1:05:16] make the preparation and take it back
[1:05:19] now my brother and sister there would be
[1:05:20] parts of the old that were fine
[1:05:22] many of us before we came to the message
[1:05:24] i say many of us i was i was young and
[1:05:27] and a very very don't fit this mold
[1:05:30] but many of you prayed read your bibles
[1:05:34] many of you asked god for wisdom before
[1:05:36] you came to the message
[1:05:38] god didn't scrape that away from you he
[1:05:40] didn't take those things that were godly
[1:05:43] that were already established in your
[1:05:44] life and scrape them away
[1:05:46] but everything that was not of him
[1:05:48] everything that was kind of
[1:05:50] unfirm unfrom foundation everything that
[1:05:53] was
[1:05:54] flaky he scraped that away because he
[1:05:57] knew
[1:05:58] when he come and laid the pure word on
[1:06:00] you
[1:06:01] what wasn't tested tried and true would
[1:06:04] fail
[1:06:05] right doesn't the fire say everything
[1:06:07] that goes through the fire i'm just
[1:06:08] going to condense it down everything
[1:06:09] that goes through the fire that's not of
[1:06:11] god will burn
[1:06:12] up and so it comes down that it's there
[1:06:16] that the preparation must be
[1:06:18] taken and it scrapes it down and i'm
[1:06:20] telling you i'm ashamed to say this
[1:06:22] but god's still scraping on me amen we
[1:06:25] can almost change that one
[1:06:27] song that says god's still working on me
[1:06:29] god's still scraping on me
[1:06:32] amen because he's got to get down to
[1:06:34] where every last little thing that's not
[1:06:36] of him that won't stand the fire and you
[1:06:39] say oh god why is this happening to me
[1:06:41] we should be saying thank you lord it's
[1:06:44] happening to me
[1:06:47] because you see if you weren't a son or
[1:06:48] daughter of god it wouldn't matter
[1:06:50] because you're not going to make it
[1:06:51] through the fire
[1:06:52] anyhow ouch that's rough brother paul
[1:06:57] that's truth so we should be thanking
[1:07:01] god for the trials through the struggles
[1:07:03] through the times
[1:07:04] we say ah i just feel so so washed out i
[1:07:07] feel so
[1:07:08] distracted i feel so this whatever it
[1:07:10] might be in your life
[1:07:11] you know and you do that and and you
[1:07:13] ought to be stopping as the scripture
[1:07:15] says thank god for the fiery trial
[1:07:18] amen you want to thank god when you are
[1:07:21] oppressed to the very
[1:07:23] limit of your ability and you say i
[1:07:26] can't go no further
[1:07:27] and to realize as the little story goes
[1:07:30] there's only one set of footprints in
[1:07:31] the sand
[1:07:33] you realize when you're here going i
[1:07:35] can't do it no longer lord you haven't
[1:07:37] been doing it for a long time
[1:07:42] are we all right this morning
[1:07:46] you see in preparation for a higher
[1:07:48] calling the old self must be stripped
[1:07:50] away
[1:07:52] and then god doesn't leave you just
[1:07:53] stripped and empty something's wrong
[1:07:55] saints if you
[1:07:56] come and give your heart to the lord and
[1:07:58] you end up stripped and empty
[1:07:59] something's wrong you have not
[1:08:02] approached something correctly someone's
[1:08:03] lied to you
[1:08:04] because you see when god strips
[1:08:07] everything away from us
[1:08:08] he starts then to build it back up to
[1:08:10] match the calling
[1:08:12] our calling can someone say amen this
[1:08:15] morning
[1:08:16] our calling what is our calling this
[1:08:18] morning oh we're not talking about
[1:08:20] being a pr preacher a song leader or
[1:08:22] this or that
[1:08:23] we're talking about the calling of being
[1:08:25] the bride to the lord jesus christ
[1:08:27] he'll strip away everything and prepare
[1:08:30] us to this place
[1:08:31] can someone lift a hand and say you know
[1:08:33] what that fits i have gone through this
[1:08:36] i've had so much stripped away but god
[1:08:39] is building it back up thank you lord
[1:08:44] amen hallelujah what's this preparation
[1:08:48] for
[1:08:50] so we can go around the world and tell
[1:08:51] everybody i'm the bride of christ i'm
[1:08:52] the bride of christ
[1:08:54] no sir no sir my brother and sister
[1:08:57] this preparation is very
[1:09:00] clinical
[1:09:04] very clinical it's to advance the plan
[1:09:09] of god
[1:09:12] right prophet of god said god can only
[1:09:15] use a man now he's talking about you
[1:09:16] sisters too
[1:09:19] god can only use a man he
[1:09:22] can trust so there has to be some
[1:09:26] preparation that brings us into a
[1:09:28] position god can trust us
[1:09:30] oh hallelujah what are we here for to
[1:09:33] lift up the plan of god
[1:09:35] amen and this preparation is also
[1:09:38] think about esther here this preparation
[1:09:41] is
[1:09:41] also for us to be presented
[1:09:45] amen amen esther
[1:09:48] went through her year of purification
[1:09:53] all so she could be presented
[1:09:57] now this brings a question of which i
[1:09:59] have no answer for
[1:10:02] were there others after esther
[1:10:07] that went through the purification went
[1:10:10] through the preparation
[1:10:12] but when esther was chose as queen they
[1:10:15] were never presented
[1:10:20] i would have to believe there were
[1:10:22] either that
[1:10:23] or we can take another thing from the
[1:10:25] scripture but then we'd be presuming
[1:10:28] and that would be somehow or another
[1:10:30] esther was the last
[1:10:31] one we could take that
[1:10:35] to a seventh age bride
[1:10:38] the culmination the finishing
[1:10:42] touch i don't think it's
[1:10:45] something that's going to affect whether
[1:10:49] we make a rapture or not
[1:10:52] but my mind works in such fashions i'm
[1:10:55] like
[1:10:57] lord did you type this out that of all
[1:10:59] that was presented before it comes down
[1:11:01] into a seventh day and there's a bride
[1:11:03] and you said this is my wife.
[1:11:07] now my brother and sister i don't know
[1:11:09] but what i do know
[1:11:10] is the story shows us
[1:11:14] that when he come to astor
[1:11:17] he said this is the one
[1:11:21] the search did not go on
[1:11:24] he did not then just go trying to find
[1:11:28] someone somehow that would surpass
[1:11:31] esther
[1:11:31] just in case she's out there oh i tell
[1:11:35] you what my brother and sister when the
[1:11:37] lamb was slain before the foundation of
[1:11:39] the world
[1:11:39] and god was coming down through that
[1:11:41] lamb's book of life
[1:11:42] he didn't just put your name on a
[1:11:44] waiting list a holding list
[1:11:46] a remembrance list just in case there's
[1:11:49] one better
[1:11:50] but he wrote your name hallelujah
[1:11:53] and the lamb smoke of life and said
[1:11:55] she's
[1:11:56] the one oh thank you lord
[1:12:00] now we're not sitting here kind of like
[1:12:02] at the airport
[1:12:03] looking at a little screen of waiting to
[1:12:06] see if somehow or another we
[1:12:08] still get to get on the flight
[1:12:13] i sit in an airport sister jerry and i
[1:12:15] one time and
[1:12:16] and it was interesting we had our name
[1:12:19] there trying to get upgraded to better
[1:12:21] seats
[1:12:22] and and it never happened but anyway
[1:12:24] there were people there
[1:12:26] and literally a man was asking the the
[1:12:29] lady at the deal he says ma'am i know
[1:12:31] i'm on this waiting list
[1:12:33] what do i do to make sure i get on this
[1:12:37] flight
[1:12:37] can i give the airline more money
[1:12:42] what can i do to make sure i get on
[1:12:44] there and the lady looked at him and
[1:12:47] says sir
[1:12:48] everyone in front of you has already
[1:12:51] paid for their ticket
[1:12:56] oh i hope you catch that
[1:12:59] everyone's already paid the price
[1:13:03] you can't come after the fact and pay a
[1:13:06] price
[1:13:07] and move them out of the way and i'm
[1:13:09] telling you why we couldn't pay the
[1:13:11] price ourself our lord jesus come
[1:13:13] and before the foundation of the world
[1:13:15] he went in there and said i'll shed my
[1:13:17] blood for
[1:13:18] you the price is paid you are secured
[1:13:21] you are in the rapture you are a son you
[1:13:24] are a daughter
[1:13:26] oh hallelujah it's not by my merit not
[1:13:29] my my deed not by my ability
[1:13:32] hallelujah and as we'll get to a minute
[1:13:34] i'm getting a little ahead of myself
[1:13:36] forgive me
[1:13:37] but it was not even by esther's
[1:13:40] looks that got her that position
[1:13:44] she was more fair than any other we say
[1:13:47] oh he chose her because of her looks
[1:13:49] my brother and sister he did not choose
[1:13:51] her because of her looks
[1:13:53] he chose her for another reason
[1:13:56] entirely hallelujah
[1:14:00] amen now look at this we see a
[1:14:04] transition you see because
[1:14:05] preparation without presentation is not
[1:14:08] god's plan
[1:14:09] you prepare for a rapture a rapture will
[1:14:12] be there for you
[1:14:13] you prepare to go to hell hell is there
[1:14:16] for you
[1:14:17] god brings about preparation to
[1:14:19] presentation
[1:14:21] hallelujah sons and daughters of god
[1:14:24] they will prepare themselves
[1:14:26] and they can rest assured that god will
[1:14:29] present them
[1:14:30] to what they have been called to
[1:14:32] hallelujah
[1:14:34] now look preparation is also to be found
[1:14:36] worthy
[1:14:37] now it's not in our own self is it
[1:14:40] saints there's nothing we can do
[1:14:44] we can't live holy enough
[1:14:47] i was reading about some monks in tibet
[1:14:51] once they commit themselves to that
[1:14:52] following
[1:14:54] they never again in their life indulge
[1:14:58] in anything that would be considered
[1:15:00] tasty food or indulgent food
[1:15:04] they never again sleep on a mattress
[1:15:07] with a pillow but they sleep on a bed of
[1:15:10] stone
[1:15:12] they never again
[1:15:15] go anywhere without someone going with
[1:15:19] them
[1:15:21] i can see why a few nights on a bed of
[1:15:23] stone i'd be fleeing
[1:15:26] i'd be out of there they'd find me
[1:15:29] googling
[1:15:30] in my little rock room nearest motel
[1:15:33] with comfortable bed
[1:15:36] but you see they they give up their
[1:15:38] rights completely
[1:15:42] and i read a story of a young man who
[1:15:44] actually through
[1:15:46] different circumstances end up being
[1:15:47] brought out of that
[1:15:51] probably the hand of god
[1:15:55] and he said at first everything about
[1:15:57] you rebels
[1:16:00] everything at first just there's just no
[1:16:02] way i can't
[1:16:04] but they never let you outside of the
[1:16:06] walls of the monastery they never let
[1:16:08] you anywhere without someone with you
[1:16:13] and over time
[1:16:16] you become comfortable with that
[1:16:22] yes does that sound like a conversion
[1:16:30] no
[1:16:33] no a conversion is here we are lord
[1:16:38] freely i give myself to you lord what
[1:16:40] you want me to do
[1:16:42] i don't have to become accustomed over
[1:16:46] time
[1:16:48] many of these monks did not live past
[1:16:50] their 40
[1:16:51] in their 40s they didn't even live into
[1:16:54] their 50th years
[1:16:56] they were considered an old man to make
[1:16:58] it that far because
[1:17:00] this calling that they had was
[1:17:03] was they slept in the winter time they
[1:17:06] were cold
[1:17:07] in the summertime they were hot they
[1:17:10] were
[1:17:10] they only ate just the most paltry of
[1:17:13] food
[1:17:15] that's how they thought they were going
[1:17:17] to get to heaven
[1:17:20] i'm kind of glad saints look i just a
[1:17:22] little bit of humor i hope you don't
[1:17:24] mind
[1:17:24] i'm kind of glad that i just have to die
[1:17:27] to myself
[1:17:28] while i still get to enjoy some of the
[1:17:31] things of this life
[1:17:32] hey man i still get to eat you know my
[1:17:35] wife's good cooking
[1:17:36] amen i still get to enjoy a heat and
[1:17:39] cool and
[1:17:40] these kind of things all i have to do is
[1:17:42] just die to self but yet
[1:17:44] we might still have as great a battle as
[1:17:46] they have
[1:17:48] because you see we live in the realm of
[1:17:50] laodicea
[1:17:51] but let us take this back before we move
[1:17:53] on
[1:17:55] before there ever was an earth
[1:17:59] amen god said you're the one amen
[1:18:03] you're the one i'll write your name down
[1:18:06] as a testament of that i'll tell you
[1:18:09] what it makes me really happy
[1:18:11] you see to be found worthy to come into
[1:18:16] the throne room look at esther my
[1:18:17] brother and sister
[1:18:18] i let me put it this way forgive me if
[1:18:21] it sounds like an assumption but
[1:18:22] i don't think vashti ever came to the
[1:18:24] king unless she was called
[1:18:27] but here's esther she's confident of her
[1:18:30] position she's confident of who she
[1:18:32] is not only does she come to the king
[1:18:35] uninvited
[1:18:36] she comes back again to the king to say
[1:18:39] i want to have a band quit
[1:18:40] and she has a banquet just so that she
[1:18:43] can invite the king to come to another
[1:18:45] band quit
[1:18:46] because you see the showdown's coming
[1:18:48] and she knows who she
[1:18:50] is now she's not just the queen of the
[1:18:53] kingdom
[1:18:54] she has now recognized i'm his
[1:18:57] wife can you imagine now they're there
[1:19:00] as she's coming into the fourier of
[1:19:02] uh the anteroom of the the throne room
[1:19:05] and and they come into that fourier
[1:19:07] and they're saying esther you can't go
[1:19:09] in there you go in there and he doesn't
[1:19:11] raise the scepter
[1:19:12] esther you're done you're finished and
[1:19:14] esther was there saying you guys don't
[1:19:16] understand
[1:19:17] i'm not just the queen i'm
[1:19:21] his wife i have relationship with him
[1:19:26] i'm not afraid of him rejecting me he
[1:19:29] loves me
[1:19:30] he chose me he had a choice of
[1:19:33] all the rest but he chose me
[1:19:37] oh and that was not an arrogance that
[1:19:40] was a confidence
[1:19:41] that she could stand and say i know who
[1:19:44] i
[1:19:45] am by the grace of god i know who i
[1:19:48] am in this great story hallelujah
[1:19:52] and she come to the room uninvited
[1:19:55] amen moving into a spiritual element my
[1:19:59] brother and sister to come this place
[1:20:01] to be prepared to be this blood washed
[1:20:03] bride
[1:20:04] this is not something superficial this
[1:20:06] is not dressa
[1:20:08] any old way this is not we we go against
[1:20:11] the word of god
[1:20:12] but we sing his praises so therefore
[1:20:14] he's going to love us
[1:20:16] my brother and sister a man wants a
[1:20:19] faithful wife
[1:20:20] he wants a wife that looks to him to
[1:20:23] care for him
[1:20:25] to sustain him and lift him up
[1:20:28] and become as it were a security
[1:20:35] this blood washed bride is not a matter
[1:20:37] of saying jesus died for us praise god
[1:20:40] the devil will let you say that every
[1:20:43] day of your life
[1:20:45] but without the holy ghost those are
[1:20:47] empty words
[1:20:49] amen you see my brother and sister
[1:20:53] to be received of our king
[1:20:56] is incredible but we here this morning
[1:21:00] need be able to say something on a more
[1:21:02] personal note
[1:21:03] we need to be able to say this is my
[1:21:05] bridegroom
[1:21:07] this is my husband amen a lot of people
[1:21:10] claiming a savior
[1:21:12] they claim him as healer they claim him
[1:21:14] as provider
[1:21:15] they claim him as a lot of things but
[1:21:17] there's going to be a small number that
[1:21:19] claims him as husband amen
[1:21:21] amen hallelujah
[1:21:25] you see and some people could go through
[1:21:27] almost everything i named off right
[1:21:29] there
[1:21:29] and never be presented that's right oh
[1:21:32] what a what a what a sad day
[1:21:34] now look i think this
[1:21:38] little quote right here kind of sums it
[1:21:40] up to me
[1:21:42] listen there's one woman sitting now
[1:21:44] look
[1:21:45] pardon me i know i have a warp sense of
[1:21:48] humor
[1:21:51] but you see brother branham doesn't
[1:21:53] skirt around this
[1:21:56] he says there's one woman sitting hm
[1:21:58] paul

[1:22:07] he didn't he didn't go blind
[1:22:11] he wasn't lusting after them right but
[1:22:13] he acknowledged there
[1:22:14] there is nice fine nice looking
[1:22:18] beautiful women sitting in this church
[1:22:20] this morning
[1:22:21] young woman middle-aged women old women
[1:22:25] they're all fine they're somebody's wife
[1:22:28] somebody's daughter somebody sweetheart
[1:22:31] so forth they're everyone there's one
[1:22:35] oh my can we make an emphasis on this
[1:22:37] there is
[1:22:38] one hallelujah one mrs branham sitting
[1:22:42] here
[1:22:42] you're everyone women but there's one
[1:22:46] mrs william branham she's the one that
[1:22:49] goes in a rapture i mean goes home with
[1:22:51] me
[1:22:52] she's the one is my sweetheart she is
[1:22:56] the one that's raising
[1:22:57] my children oh look at this my brother
[1:23:00] and sister acknowledging a church and i
[1:23:02] say the same here
[1:23:04] lovely sisters i love you everyone amen
[1:23:07] but i have been given one mrs jerry
[1:23:10] hailett
[1:23:10] amen one that is mine she's my
[1:23:13] sweetheart
[1:23:15] hallelujah and god doesn't have some
[1:23:18] multitude of some random choice he's got
[1:23:21] a bride
[1:23:22] she's his sweetheart and she's going
[1:23:26] home with him
[1:23:27] whoa thank you lord hallelujah
[1:23:32] thank you lord get to go home with him
[1:23:35] hallelujah now look at that i just
[1:23:38] thought that's a beautiful quote i hope
[1:23:40] you see it the same way
[1:23:42] amen don't just call us queen amen
[1:23:45] come on saints don't just call us queen
[1:23:48] in fact i was talking to a brother
[1:23:50] sometime in the message and he goes i
[1:23:51] just hate it when people
[1:23:53] are talking about and they say well this
[1:23:54] bride is the queen
[1:23:56] i understood he i he wasn't like making
[1:23:59] a point
[1:24:00] but i don't have a problem using the
[1:24:02] queen
[1:24:05] just don't leave it there because being
[1:24:08] a queen doesn't mean that she even loves
[1:24:10] the king
[1:24:11] being the queen doesn't mean she even
[1:24:13] cares and wants to serve the king
[1:24:17] oh let's call him oh hallelujah i don't
[1:24:20] want to just be called queen
[1:24:21] want to be called wife want to be called
[1:24:24] bride
[1:24:25] want to hear those little love words
[1:24:27] that come as it were between a man and
[1:24:29] his wife wife
[1:24:30] and her husband those little things that
[1:24:32] stir the heart we don't want to just
[1:24:34] have a title out here
[1:24:35] we don't want to i'll tell you i've said
[1:24:37] it before i'll say it again
[1:24:38] i kind of almost am tired i said almost
[1:24:41] i'm tired of this
[1:24:42] oh we in the message we're the message
[1:24:44] we're the message well i'm telling you
[1:24:46] my brother and sister the devil's got a
[1:24:47] message
[1:24:49] amen what is the message doing are we
[1:24:51] just message followers
[1:24:54] come on we got to be more than message
[1:24:56] followers
[1:24:58] this message called a bride for jesus
[1:25:01] christ
[1:25:01] we've got to be the wife the bride
[1:25:04] we've got to claim our rightful position
[1:25:07] not just be a follower
[1:25:09] [Applause]
[1:25:11] hallelujah oh
[1:25:14] you see amen
[1:25:20] excuse me revelations 22 17 you know
[1:25:24] this scripture but i want to just draw a
[1:25:25] point out of this
[1:25:26] and the spirit and the message
[1:25:30] follower
[1:25:33] the spirit and the message believer
[1:25:40] the spirit and
[1:25:46] bride the one
[1:25:50] you see for her to be bribed she has to
[1:25:52] be claimed
[1:25:54] amen i tell this is a funny joke
[1:25:58] it won't be funny after jerry beats me
[1:26:00] but
[1:26:01] you know i'd already expressed to jerry
[1:26:03] that i loved her
[1:26:05] i already kind of pretty much expressed
[1:26:06] to her you know hinting around
[1:26:09] you know i love you jerry and she says
[1:26:11] she said i love you back but
[1:26:13] i think i heard the door click shut
[1:26:15] before she must have said it
[1:26:18] but she told a friend
[1:26:22] who told a friend who told it to a
[1:26:24] friend
[1:26:25] who had a friend and i'm here in idaho
[1:26:29] and
[1:26:31] the sister you know i hope this church
[1:26:34] doesn't
[1:26:36] have a sister who feels like she's the
[1:26:37] queen of the busy bodies
[1:26:42] you don't even want to be a princess of
[1:26:44] the busy bodies
[1:26:46] but this sister comes up to me oh
[1:26:49] brother paul
[1:26:51] congratulations you know i'm like
[1:26:54] what are you talking about you're
[1:26:57] getting
[1:26:57] married
[1:27:01] and i was like here's my punchline
[1:27:04] saying
[1:27:06] don't i have to ask her first
[1:27:12] you have an asker no i haven't asked her
[1:27:17] turns out she'd already told the whole
[1:27:19] church
[1:27:20] paul was getting married hallelujah
[1:27:24] i'll tell you what
[1:27:27] her revelation my revelation might have
[1:27:29] been in the same topic line
[1:27:32] but it didn't stop me i think i drove to
[1:27:34] washington the next week and asked jerry
[1:27:36] to marry me
[1:27:37] i didn't want her to be ashamed
[1:27:38] [Laughter]
[1:27:42] look the spirit and the bride she's
[1:27:46] already claimed
[1:27:50] she's not a hopeful she's not a wannabe
[1:27:55] she's not a maybe today
[1:27:59] she knows she's claimed
[1:28:02] she already has an identity
[1:28:06] and the spirit and the bride say common
[1:28:09] look at this how beautiful this is
[1:28:11] because we can take
[1:28:12] every one of these and take this heareth
[1:28:14] my brother and sister
[1:28:15] and tie it back to revelation and tie it
[1:28:18] back to the prophet of god saying that
[1:28:20] only those with the holy ghost will have
[1:28:21] a true revelation of this word
[1:28:23] amen so when you look at this now i'm
[1:28:26] not trying to do a doctrine or nothing
[1:28:27] don't misunderstand me
[1:28:29] as spirit and the bride say come and let
[1:28:31] him that heareth which is bride
[1:28:33] say come and let him that is a thirst
[1:28:35] which is bride
[1:28:37] come amen and whosoever will they're the
[1:28:40] bride
[1:28:40] amen let them take the water of life
[1:28:43] freely
[1:28:44] it all points back that the anointing of
[1:28:46] god
[1:28:47] predestination coming on the soul comes
[1:28:50] back and points
[1:28:51] us back again and again and again that
[1:28:54] god called you before the foundation of
[1:28:57] the world
[1:28:57] he put you in the book in the plan wrote
[1:29:00] it in his own precious blood
[1:29:02] and sealed it oh hallelujah it doesn't
[1:29:05] get much firmer than that does it saints
[1:29:08] do we need some other kind of
[1:29:09] reassurance that we are the bride of
[1:29:11] christ
[1:29:12] my brother and sister god is coming he
[1:29:15] is coming for a bride
[1:29:17] now look at this you know and in this
[1:29:19] thought process
[1:29:20] it just dawned on me what the next quote
[1:29:22] is i'm speaking from my heart
[1:29:23] i didn't even choose this for what it
[1:29:25] was it just dawns on me as it comes on
[1:29:27] the screen right here
[1:29:29] hallelujah
[1:29:32] yeah i was looking at content i wasn't
[1:29:35] looking at titles
[1:29:37] while the true bride
[1:29:41] anybody know her i've met her i go to
[1:29:44] church with her
[1:29:46] hallelujah you guys ought to be proud of
[1:29:48] me i go to church with her
[1:29:52] the true bride attracts the attention of
[1:29:54] god
[1:29:55] by wearing her fashions
[1:30:06] i could say a lot of things there but i
[1:30:08] feel like the lord just checked me
[1:30:11] while the true bride attack attracts the
[1:30:13] attention of god
[1:30:14] by keeping his word amen right amen now
[1:30:17] notice
[1:30:18] let us notice christ you say well now
[1:30:21] wait a minute what about this beauty
[1:30:22] you're talking about
[1:30:24] the bible said in isaiah 53 2 that when
[1:30:26] jesus came
[1:30:27] there was no beauty of him that we
[1:30:29] should desire him that's right
[1:30:30] congregation says amen there's no beauty
[1:30:34] if he would have come in worldly beauty
[1:30:36] as satan is today
[1:30:38] the people would have run around him and
[1:30:40] accept him the way they do the church
[1:30:42] today
[1:30:43] they would have believed him received
[1:30:45] him as they do satan today
[1:30:47] certainly they would but he didn't come
[1:30:49] in that kind of beauty
[1:30:51] but he always comes in the beauty
[1:30:54] of character oh thank you
[1:30:57] lord amen that gives an out to some of
[1:31:00] us that aren't so good looking amen
[1:31:02] god's not looking at our looks
[1:31:04] and that's why i make this claim earlier
[1:31:07] and i stand behind it believe it with
[1:31:08] all of my heart
[1:31:09] that king hazardous did not look at
[1:31:11] esther and say my goodness she's the
[1:31:13] most beautiful woman i
[1:31:15] ever saw i gotta marry her he'd already
[1:31:18] had a woman that was renowned for her
[1:31:20] beauty
[1:31:22] but at this point he learned a lesson
[1:31:24] and now he's there and said you know
[1:31:26] what
[1:31:26] i'm not gonna marry just for beauty she
[1:31:29] is
[1:31:30] beautiful but look at the character
[1:31:34] that she has and you know how she got
[1:31:36] that character
[1:31:40] [Music]
[1:31:43] no no her parents die
[1:31:48] we don't know how they died she's raised
[1:31:51] up in a world
[1:31:53] that's difficult
[1:31:56] you know how mean children can be i can
[1:31:59] see esther as a little girl in school
[1:32:03] esther where did you lose your parents
[1:32:08] did you get rid of them i wish i could
[1:32:10] get rid of mine
[1:32:12] and asked her there and her heart
[1:32:14] breaking she never chose that
[1:32:18] and mordecai i don't think he was a
[1:32:19] slacker
[1:32:22] i don't think he said now children if
[1:32:24] you feel like it tonight excuse me
[1:32:26] children if you feel like it tonight
[1:32:28] before you go to sleep you'll read your
[1:32:30] bible
[1:32:31] i think mordecai said esther
[1:32:35] for your head hits that pillow you're
[1:32:38] going to read your bible tonight
[1:32:40] but you see we don't want to hurt our
[1:32:43] tender little children's
[1:32:45] feelings they might have no self-esteem
[1:32:49] when we're done with them okay well what
[1:32:52] you're worried about losing their
[1:32:54] self-esteem
[1:32:55] you're not worried at all about losing
[1:32:57] their soul
[1:32:59] we ought to be more worried about losing
[1:33:00] their soul amen god can deal with the
[1:33:03] self-esteem
[1:33:04] hallelujah i hope you don't think i'm
[1:33:07] too harsh
[1:33:10] you see he always comes
[1:33:13] in the beauty of character there christ
[1:33:15] wasn't a beautiful great strong stout
[1:33:17] man god doesn't choose that kind
[1:33:20] hallelujah amen i'll tell you this this
[1:33:23] quote is a little bit influenced to me
[1:33:24] that i think esther
[1:33:25] had a character that was stunning
[1:33:29] i think there was something about her i
[1:33:32] can see
[1:33:33] now look let me throw another thing i'm
[1:33:35] sorry that's the way my brain works
[1:33:36] i'm not trying to make doctrine out of
[1:33:38] it
[1:33:41] he invites her raises the scepter
[1:33:44] right now the proper etiquette saints is
[1:33:47] that when she come
[1:33:48] we'll just use this mic stand here when
[1:33:50] she come to the throne
[1:33:52] with the scepter raised out she placed
[1:33:55] her fingers
[1:33:56] on the end of the scepter it wasn't a
[1:33:59] haphazard
[1:34:00] hey husband and flop down in the chair
[1:34:04] hmm there was a little respect
[1:34:09] there was a little continuity there
[1:34:12] we're one
[1:34:13] but still god has a plan
[1:34:17] and what does he do next he says you
[1:34:19] know what esther i'm going to give you
[1:34:20] even up to the half of my kingdom
[1:34:22] now i'm telling you what saints now
[1:34:24] pardon me for using this word because we
[1:34:26] should call no man fool
[1:34:28] but a man would be foolish
[1:34:31] to ever go into business with a foolish
[1:34:34] partner that's the truth that's
[1:34:37] absolutely right
[1:34:39] he just offered half of his kingdom to
[1:34:41] her
[1:34:43] oh macy's here i come
[1:34:48] no sir you know why he could make that
[1:34:51] offer
[1:34:53] well i don't know where some of you shop
[1:34:55] maybe you don't like macy's
[1:34:56] excuse me if i picked the wrong store
[1:35:00] you know why he could offer that because
[1:35:02] he already
[1:35:03] knew how she would run her
[1:35:06] half of the kingdom
[1:35:10] he already knew that she would be there
[1:35:12] saying my husband
[1:35:14] likes this and he doesn't like this
[1:35:17] my husband sees it this way and not this
[1:35:21] way
[1:35:22] and she would say and that matters to me
[1:35:26] that's right now i want you to think
[1:35:28] about the church world we live in today
[1:35:29] my brother and sister they're running
[1:35:31] their half of the kingdom any old way
[1:35:34] they please
[1:35:35] he my husband likes this i like this
[1:35:38] my husband wants this i'm gonna do this
[1:35:42] no no i think king hazardous learned
[1:35:45] his lesson and he says look this woman
[1:35:47] has
[1:35:48] character and praise god
[1:35:52] she's beautiful young men heed that amen
[1:35:57] you find the list beauty ought to be
[1:35:59] down the list of ways
[1:36:01] amen character should be right at the
[1:36:03] top that's the prophet's words
[1:36:05] good cooking ought to be somewhere in
[1:36:07] there then if she's beautiful
[1:36:09] hey praise the lord you have got it
[1:36:12] hallelujah but i just really want to go
[1:36:15] back to that very top
[1:36:17] while the true bride attracts the
[1:36:19] attention of god
[1:36:20] by keeping his word
[1:36:24] never how big a church is never how
[1:36:25] beautiful a church is how good or choir
[1:36:27] is
[1:36:28] how good all this or that the other it
[1:36:30] is amen
[1:36:31] it's the word that's it oh hallelujah
[1:36:35] oh my amen where does time go can
[1:36:37] somebody tell me
[1:36:39] i'd like to travel there and redeem it
[1:36:41] now look
[1:36:45] we're on the last quote when god is took
[1:36:48] at his word
[1:36:50] he's able to provide whatever he has
[1:36:52] need of
[1:36:54] now you notice i'm getting a little
[1:36:56] nitpicky here okay i will admit this
[1:36:58] he didn't say he's able to provide
[1:37:01] whatever you need
[1:37:06] what he needs that's right right that's
[1:37:09] exactly right
[1:37:13] he's able to provide whatever he has
[1:37:15] need of god jehovah jireh is still
[1:37:17] jehovah jireh tonight
[1:37:19] he has sacrifice already provided
[1:37:23] i got excited when i read this i hope
[1:37:25] you guys catch this he has a church
[1:37:27] provided
[1:37:28] you realize before i even knew i was
[1:37:30] part of this he already had me provided
[1:37:32] hallelujah he has a messenger provided
[1:37:36] the holy spirit
[1:37:37] he's here now now those people that keep
[1:37:40] struggling there's a certain crowd
[1:37:42] that just keeps struggling whether god
[1:37:43] is here now it's just the holy ghost
[1:37:45] just put it inanimate off to the side so
[1:37:47] holy ghost i'm sorry the prophet of god
[1:37:49] said it's all god
[1:37:51] amen the prophet of god says right here
[1:37:53] unless you think this just stopped in
[1:37:55] 1962
[1:37:57] amen that he has a messenger provided
[1:38:00] the holy spirit
[1:38:01] he's here now jehovah jireh
[1:38:05] the lord has provided himself a bible a
[1:38:08] spirit
[1:38:09] a church someone say amen and message
[1:38:13] a messenger and the hour is here now for
[1:38:16] the church to be raptured
[1:38:17] and taken home jehovah jireh look at the
[1:38:21] office how god defines himself
[1:38:23] amen in morphe putting on the mask
[1:38:26] jehovah jireh will provide the means
[1:38:29] to take the church out of this world
[1:38:32] you won't provide it i won't provide it
[1:38:35] he'll provide it hallelujah we get all
[1:38:38] fretted i'm not a good enough christian
[1:38:41] lord help me i fail you
[1:38:42] you just stand on the word and keep
[1:38:44] claiming it and stand there and stand
[1:38:46] there
[1:38:47] and he will provide the rapturing faith
[1:38:50] that it takes to change this mortal body
[1:38:53] we can never provide it for ourselves
[1:38:55] we can never attain to it
[1:38:59] but he'll provide it amen by
[1:39:02] transforming these feeble bodies of ours
[1:39:07] can i insert something here without
[1:39:09] changing the message
[1:39:12] by transforming these feeble bodies
[1:39:17] well that should already been done
[1:39:20] maybe it'll happen right now it better
[1:39:23] happen before the year 2021 is over or
[1:39:26] else we got serious doubts
[1:39:29] should happen in 77
[1:39:33] sorry he didn't say when he was gonna
[1:39:35] transform these
[1:39:37] feeble bodies hallelujah i can bring you
[1:39:40] a quote if you want whether brother
[1:39:41] brown said it might be a hundred years
[1:39:52] a lot of people are going to die my
[1:39:55] brothers and sisters
[1:39:56] a hundred years all of the old
[1:39:59] established witnesses of this message
[1:40:01] would be gone
[1:40:05] does that mean the message goes with it
[1:40:08] sorry the message is not about man it's
[1:40:11] about jesus christ
[1:40:13] same yesterday today forever
[1:40:19] hallelujah come on saints don't start
[1:40:22] putting time lapses on god
[1:40:24] don't start putting if this don't happen
[1:40:26] by this time here and that don't happen
[1:40:28] like this
[1:40:28] then i'm probably finished you do that
[1:40:30] you might as well just quit right now
[1:40:34] but faith takes the halts of the promise
[1:40:39] and doesn't let go
[1:40:43] hallelujah sister ruth would you come
[1:40:46] the piano
[1:40:48] jehovah jireh will provide the means to
[1:40:50] take that church out of this world by
[1:40:51] transforming these feeble bodies of ours
[1:40:54] and take them up into glory jehovah
[1:40:56] jireh how will it come to pass
[1:40:58] in a modern day like we're living in
[1:41:01] that these things will be
[1:41:05] so interesting i i like science as well
[1:41:07] as anyone does i think
[1:41:09] or close maybe not so much
[1:41:14] but one of the stories that always
[1:41:16] intrigued me was these students that
[1:41:18] went to
[1:41:19] a university back east and this quite a
[1:41:21] few years ago
[1:41:22] when did do you guys remember the days
[1:41:24] when carbon dating was just it was in
[1:41:26] the news all the time
[1:41:28] we've carbon dated this and it's this
[1:41:29] many million and this carbon dated this
[1:41:31] and we carbon dated that
[1:41:33] and one of these graduate students
[1:41:36] i'm guessing he wasn't quite a believer
[1:41:38] in carbon dating
[1:41:39] and they had been climbing up they kind
[1:41:41] of did this research thing up in the
[1:41:43] mountains
[1:41:44] and uh back east there in the uh
[1:41:47] mountains were old what they call old
[1:41:49] mountains and they were
[1:41:50] gathering specimens to take back and
[1:41:52] carbon date
[1:41:54] and as kind of a joke he dug down in the
[1:41:57] bottom of the fire pit and he took this
[1:42:00] chunk
[1:42:01] of charred wood and put it in a research
[1:42:04] bag and sealed it
[1:42:07] now the people that are doing the carbon
[1:42:09] dating they only take notes this is
[1:42:12] specimen number blah blah blah
[1:42:14] they don't know anything about it
[1:42:18] and this piece of half charred firewood
[1:42:21] was like 1.2 million years old
[1:42:28] kid got expelled from school over that
[1:42:33] he was making a mockery of their great
[1:42:35] science
[1:42:36] now my brother and sister if
[1:42:40] we're so caught up in this world that we
[1:42:43] can't trust god
[1:42:45] then this last line right here will
[1:42:47] become a major
[1:42:48] stroke in your life how will it come to
[1:42:52] pass
[1:42:55] without faith it is impossible to please
[1:42:59] god
[1:43:02] how it will come to pass will be this
[1:43:05] bride
[1:43:06] the esther of our age right amen who
[1:43:09] says
[1:43:10] i trust him completely
[1:43:16] because you see with one bit of doubt
[1:43:18] satan will zero in on that doubt
[1:43:21] and then he will offer evidence after
[1:43:24] evidence
[1:43:25] after evidence after evidence of why
[1:43:28] that can't be so
[1:43:35] how will it come past in a modern day
[1:43:39] i like honestly how brother brown puts
[1:43:42] this
[1:43:43] he doesn't say how will it come to pass
[1:43:46] where we're living he's putting it right
[1:43:49] down into this great scientific day
[1:43:53] where young people interviewed on
[1:43:55] college campuses
[1:43:59] look into the camera and say
[1:44:02] i was raised in church but science has
[1:44:06] proven the bible is
[1:44:10] false
[1:44:14] what is it a modern day amen
[1:44:19] as it was in the day of noah
[1:44:24] a great scientific age
[1:44:28] so shall it be the coming
[1:44:31] of the son of man amen
[1:44:35] but i'm telling you my king is on the
[1:44:38] throne
