asked me to um post and share with the church her aunt and uncle brother davey and sister donna reinerson are having a 50th anniversary we've posted it on the board and sister angie said you know maybe some of the saints would feel led to share a card or something to encourage them so i just want you to know that is on the board 50 years amen that is a long time amen and especially to be married amen but we thank the lord for his keeping power hallelujah well let's just go right into our thought today saints happy mother's day to each and every one of our mothers god bless you it definitely is brother jason said being a mother certainly has a lot of work associated with that a lot of give and take and a lot of times uh great trials and troubles and whatever and you know we're gonna we're gonna uh talk about a mother today where we're picking her right out of this scripture we're going to talk about her and we're going to see what a mother's love what it would bring about and what the presence of god can do when when god is in the house amen so let's just stand as we would go into second kings we just want to uh just uh speak to you today the oil is sufficient amen so we just take this right out of the scripture today out of second kings the fourth chapter verses one through seven amen i think it's a very familiar uh story to each and every one of us uh but today we're just going to uh pull something right out of this just a little portion uh to to grab a hols of and uh make a point about it my brother and sister uh and uh you know we we just i had another title which i will just use as a subtitle you might say uh as we go along uh to bring about a point second kings the fourth chapter verses one through seven now there cried a certain woman of the wives of the sons of the prophets unto elisha saying thy servant my husband is dead she is now a widow thou knowest the servant did fear the lord and the creditor has come to take unto him my two sons to be bond men and elisha said unto her what shall i do for thee tell me what hast thou in the house and she said then handmaid hath not anything in the house save a pot of oil then he said go and borrow the vessels abroad of all thy neighbors even empty vessels borrow not a few now you imagine the stir that went through the neighborhood that morning when she and her children are knocking on every single house saying i need every empty vessel you've got i will return them but for now i need them and i need them speedily amen everybody thought what is going on at their house hallelujah well i'll save that for just a minute here amen and when thou art come in thou shalt shut the door upon thee and upon thy sons and shalt pour out unto all those vessels and thou shall set aside that which is full so she went from him and shut the door upon her and upon her sons who brought the vessels to her and she poured out and it came to pass when the vessels were full that she said unto her son bring me yet a vessel and he said unto her there is not a vessel more and the oil stayed then she came and told the man of god and he said go sell the oil pay thy debt and live thou and thy children of the rest heavenly father we ask for your guiding hand today lord jesus we just ask you to come in focus our thoughts lord may we each and every one this morning just apply ourselves and father as i've been studying and just reading as the prophet of god is talking about getting into the spirit may father this morning each one of us lord not just come to church to set and to listen and just to sing but father may we come and get into the spirit this morning father that we would lord be able to welcome you and father as you stir the water this morning lord may we respond father we're not here to race one another father to get into your presence but father you are more than sufficient for each and every one of us and lord we just ask you now come and lord as it was on the day of pentecost when you broke yourself into licks of fire and come upon the people we would ask you this morning lord may your holy spirit come down in our midst this morning father move lord lord in each one in each circumstance each state of life and state of mind lord we need you and we thank you father because you said if we would welcome you invite you that you would come in our midst and i believe that this morning and ask for your hand of mercy may we express this correctly in a fashion that is pleasing to you lord in the name of jesus christ amen you may be seated hallelujah now as we look at this today i just want to kind of come along i wouldn't call it a bible study i'm not a very good teacher as it is to just break things down line by line but as we would look today my brother and sister just want to come and and the lord be gracious that we could uh just catch uh the types and shadows now just doing some reading and brother branham talks about being a typologist uh talks about how he can draw these things out of the out of this scripture and how you can make those comparisons and see what is what by these types and today we want to just use this as it were as a type because my brother and sister i don't believe old or new testament that this is just something that is history but this bible my brother and sister is a living bible amen this word of god is living and it will live just as big in our life as we will give it room to grow amen you know isn't it interesting uh that you can take and the environment will control the growth and it doesn't matter whether you're talking about livestock or or you know plants or whatever it might be or the human relationship and that's why when you come into a world my brother and sister that is a very tightly controlled world a world where everything uh must conform uh and i'm talking more in a natural sense you will find that people while they would uh grow but they don't grow to their full potential and what we want to do today is grow in our lord jesus christ to our full potential uh to raise up into a position where god is pleased not only with us but our life is then such a perfect reflection of our lord jesus christ that uh people as we would look down through the time my brother and sister i used to have kind of a a different outlook on those people that almost thought brother branham was god i used to think what was wrong with those people but lord help us live a life that would be so reflective of jesus christ that people would say this is not a normal person amen otherwise we can take on the cloak of religion or the cloak of christianity and we can say i am a message believer but as i shared the quote with you i believe it was on wednesday night brother branham says so you say you're a believer you believe these things that just shows you can read amen so we want more than just reading we want the life that is in the gospel right now my brother and sister that's what the gospel is is the life behind amen so we can say well i read my bible i listen i do all of these things but if we don't pursue the life now when i use that word pursue for those who are very technical people i'm not talking about us doing it it's god doing it us right because see we've never uh went after god we never pursued god god's always pursued us but we can stand here today and say thank you lord that that little spark of life that was inside of us has now caused us as it were to pursue the word amen for wherever the carcass is the eagles will be gathered so there had to be something that drew the eagle to that carcass amen and so we just look today for these things of god and i hope this will be a blessing when we're finished today so where we have this as the scripture uses the word and i will use those words a certain woman amen not named by name but uh identified and here she is uh speaking uh to the prophet sharing with the prophet giving a reminder she says you know my husband was a god-fearing man he was a faithful man and and we've come into this circumstance and no doubt my brother and sister i i would think that elisha would have known her husband but there might have been enough sons of the prophets that it might not have been a close relationship but she's there now before elisha saying you know what i i want to remind you i want to bring this up before you that my husband is dead and he was a god-fearing man he feared the lord and now we have a creditor and this creditor has come and maybe served warning left a notice upon the door that this debt will be collected and uh we intend to take your sons as a bond men and they are going to labor now my brother and sister you know in the world of the bond men they never worked for the same wage as the free man did so as a bond man was there working he might be getting a pittance towards the debt because they would say well we've clothed you we fed you we did all of this for you so you know instead of earning just for an example instead of earning the hundred dollars a day maybe the bond man might earn ten and so it was there it would take a long time to pay off a debt and so these young men did not have a very bright future in front of them they were they were looking and no doubt you know in their self they were thinking oh my how did we end up my dad served the people was in the ministry was faithful to god how can we end up here many a preacher's kid has fought that yeah amen now you see with the creditor at the door this mother has come to a place that she says you know what i'm not going to take this situation laying down these are my children oh saints i want you to think about it these are my children amen i'm not going to take this laying down because these are my children and oh yeah they'll be free in a few years and that they'll be delivered you know sometimes we get that way as parents you know our children are headed towards the world and we like well we gave them to the lord and you know we know they'll be back why don't you fight for them now amen why don't we stand up and say badmin you know creditor you can't have them in the first place there are children yep wants to take my sons to labor to pay a debt do you know that's exactly how satan works reminds me of that see he's trying to convince us saints that our children must end up in the world because we sinned they must end up there if they're ever going to have a real experience with god they'll have to have something to be forgiven for well my brother and sister we were born in sin shaped in iniquity we don't have to go pile anything else on the load to add to it to make it worthwhile hallelujah i tell you there's nothing better than to see our children and i pray god that will give us the kind of testimony here in the church in our families to see our children rising up and have an experience with the lord amen to realize i don't have to go out there and taste of all of that i don't have to eat the filth to know what the good is and i tell you my brother and sister we'll come and we'll stand someday and we'll look at ourselves and say did i do all that i could do i look at my own life i look at my children and god's blessed me with good children i got a son i'm unashamed to say that he isn't doing all that he knows to do and he knows all to do but he's got to make a decision is it worth the effort my brother and sister will look back in life i can assure you and everything that was good we will determine it was worth the effort amen you know it's there we spend i read a deal it was kind of a you know thing about the golden years we spend all our lives saving our money and we come to the golden years and we spend our gold trying to live a few more years and so it's there that we come my brother and sister to realize whatever we pay right now on the behalf of our children is worth the investment amen because we send the pattern must repeat no my brother and sister my brother gideon retrieved many years ago preached a sermon i don't remember the exact title but i just always in my mind titled it the cycle breaker amen we've got a god that is here to take care of the debt he's here to take care of the circumstance he's here to break the cycle my brother and sister we look at life now i'm talking spiritually we look at life in the cycles of life and death but how about as sons and daughters of god we look at the cycle as in just simply life amen because you see if we ever had eternal life the prophet of god says we always had eternal life if we ever work his we were always his amen it's not something that comes and goes amen just as i was sharing the other day in question and answers you know my brother branham you know answers a question there about someone wanting to know if someone could drift away would god bring them back and the prophet of god says that if they were a real true believer the real true seed of god god would bring them back amen now this is not my brother and sister obligation in the sense that we as humans look at obligation we say well i promise that i would do this so no matter whether i feel like this or not i need to go do this my brother and sister god has no such feeling god is there says i by my word i had none greater to swear by so i swear by myself and so i am here more than happy in fact if i could put these words in there god is thrilled to fulfill his promise to you and i it is not i have an obligation it is i said it i said it because i meant it and i meant it because it's mine and i'm claiming what is mine hallelujah you see what god is doing amen now you know look my brother and sister life is full of patterns and they say that you know different times of life different years different things you know and uh you know it's interesting i i'm not throwing jerry under the bus but some time back she said you know i'm surprised paul that you're still farming because uh it used to be that every seven years you changed jobs and you know my brother and sister i've stuck with this one because i'm just dumb as dirt and dirt grows things and so i'll just grow things amen but look at this my brother and sister how god comes and he comes in a pattern as we were talking about there at beth hmm bethesda boy i don't know why that's such a tongue twister to me amen bethesda my brother and sister the scripture says that that the angel of the lord come down in a season in a certain time that was according to god's calendar that was according to god's timing there was no man could set there even if he had the world's biggest abacus at that time and run all the numbers he would ever figure out when the angel was coming back but my brother and sister we have a greater promise is that not what the word for our hour declared we have a greater promise and we know when the coming of the lord is amen oh people say no you don't no you don't oh but we do my brother and sister we know when the coming of the lord is well you say oh the rapture i wasn't talking about the rapture i was talking about the coming of the lord amen and the coming of the lord he comes where he's invited he comes where he is welcome he has come where the prophet of god said he is entertained amen so we can bring the lord into our presence amen and base in that presence any time my brother and sister you will never cry out to god you will never yield yourself to him and speak out from the heart and him ignore you you say but he sometimes doesn't answer our prayers my brother and sister no god always answers prayer he doesn't work on our calendar amen he works on his own timepiece amen but god has always come he said i'll be with you even in you so if he's in you does that mean oh that the door is slamming as he leaves right now or the door is so to speak slamming as he just came right now know my brother and sister he's here he's here thank you lord he's here hallelujah and so we have this friend i mean there's no greater friend than jesus even so that sometimes in the human element we we definitely like to have friends but there's no greater friend than our lord jesus now elisha says unto her you know what shall i do for thee now my brother and sister she didn't come to find a few kind words you know maybe you can have a fundraiser a raffle maybe you can have a bake sale gather up a little money maybe you can make a deal with the creditor that he would let you make payments and let your son say free no she wasn't looking for those kind of things she wasn't looking my brother and sister for just a few kind words she came for a solution and we sometimes i believe now this might seem a little strong but we come to church sometimes for the kind words we come to church sometimes my brother and sister just to hear something that might lift our spirit but i want you to come to church for the solution amen not just the band-aid not just enough ointment to cover the wound amen but to come for the solution to your problem you need healing then come with your heart made up i'm healed you need a deliverance come with your heart made up i am delivered amen you need something out of the word of god then come and say lord the prophet of god told me to pray for revelation above all else so lord i'm going to pray for revelation i want to see more of you lord hallelujah oh my brother and sister you see what we got to do is forget about just receiving a few kind words from the priest and a pack on pat on the back you know and just come to the place that we actually reach out and get a horse of god amen because when you get a hold of god god will send the right person or send the right to come around and bring a solution to your problem but you can touch the kind old priest you can come and have the preacher anoint you with oil and lay hands on it but my brother and sister if you don't ever get in the spirit you don't ever get connected to god then all you're doing is coming into a tradition well when i don't feel good i come to church now don't get me wrong i'm not speaking against this it's scriptural but you know i went to church they prayed for me nothing changed well probably you got what you were expecting deep down in your heart oh god help us not to be a hindered or turn to the side now i oh i'm going to get my foot in my mouth this morning amen well praise the lord jerry didn't polish my shoes and so i won't have to taste the shoe polish anyway but look my brother and sister just because your healing didn't come there's no reason for you to deny that it's already took place well hallelujah brother paul i'd sure like to see the manifestation of it get behind the veil where the shekinah glory dwells get in there and get so immersed in god but then i might start acting real religious or funny or something brother paul well i'll tell you what i'd rather act real something funny to the world my brother and sister and receive a promise from god than i would to be all prim proper my ties just right my shoes are just right this is just right that is just right and i'm as dry as an old stick in the barnyard oh hallelujah you see elisha said unto her what shall i do for thee now my brother and sister i'm going to step out a long ways i didn't provide all the quotes and the foundation for this so it might be a good time just either trust me or not but please trust me my brother and sister you see as the prophet of god was dealing in our generation in our time and people would come in the line you know he didn't have an instantaneous insight to their life many times they stood there for just a moment of people were hushed and reverent and he stood there for a moment and he even declares this in words when he says now as it were now pardon these are just my words my spirit amen the holy ghost in me is connecting with you so we've got a data port we've got a a thumb drive whatever you want to call it the little usb stick and he's putting it in there and he's making a connection and when he makes that connection then he starts to name names dates places circumstances my brother and sister or many times he just says you know sir you have heart trouble go away god has healed you amen so it didn't always have to be a great big story but sometimes brother branham felt led to add the words amen to give you might say the dialogue to give this a breakdown of what is going on now imagine how that family felt or those people felt you know when the prophet of god shares to the whole wide world that uh you know this this woman she was over here at this church in this hospital this church this church this church and she come and she had a demon she's getting worse and she comes in there and brother branham is dealing with her and you know when brother branham starts to talk about her life she starts screaming don't say it don't say it but brother branham says oh no problem see your husband has the same issue my brother and sister uh you know it didn't take rocket scientists to figure out who the prophet of god was talking about people get all nervous while they're talking about us well sometimes we us need talked about amen sometimes we ought to have enough courage to say lord i'm the one lord i'm the one that the holy spirit's doing this or coming or moving for a certain reason i am the one amen my brother and sister brother branham calls people out you know the reason this is happening you're doing this in your life you think that man in the flesh appreciated it being put out to the world but when that man delivered of that spirit and got out of his flesh and got into the spirit he was thanking god he wasn't embarrassed he wasn't whatever he said lord thank you thank you i've been delivered amen hallelujah and i say lord whatever it takes reveal to us our shortcomings our failures whatever it might be lord that we could come into this place so here elisha says unto her what shall i do for thee and i can imagine there's a pause my brother and sister that is taking place what is he doing elisha is getting into the mind of god he's connecting with her spirit and god is dealing with him and now my brother and sister if you just let me be presumptuous for a minute this morning i believe elisha knew that there was a miracle on the way i believe elisha knew that something was fixing to happen he wasn't just giving her an exercise he wasn't just giving her something to occupy her time but he was then connected to her and i tell you my brother and sister i think that we should come to the place when we not just the house of god but just coming one another in our daily lives we ought to get to the place that we know there's a miracle on the way we know that god is present and that he is working and he is working for our good amen so you know he then says i believe this is the connection now now pardon me for putting it this way but we live in the 21st century after the little circle that no one could see quit going around elisha says tell me what's in your house oh i want you to understand saints how god works i don't think they were probably sleeping on the floor but it's possible maybe the only thing in their house was a cruise of oil but you see god oh hallelujah god will take what is in your life already and god will use that for your deliverance god will use what's in your life right now and he will use that to deepen our experience you know say lord sweep my life perfectly clean no god will use my brother and sister the clutter as it were of our life now i just want you to grasp this what a question that he says what hath thou in the house think about it what do we have in the house come on saints what do we have in the house if elisha was talking to you and i what could we offer to elisha as in our house amen would it bring a miracle or would it hinder a miracle oh my brother and sister we're not just living in just some realm where hey i'm a spiritual person you know that was the whole fundamentals of the two soul doctrine i can behave this way here and go to church and be this person here my brother and sister that's not what it's about it's important what is in our house amen talking about the natural house and the spiritual house what is in the house lord help us come to a place that what's in our house will bring about or facilitate a miracle or a move of god not something that would be well you know uh look the prophet's asking about what's in my house so i'll just go ahead and um it'll be all right he won't notice come on saints it's house cleaning time it's time for us to get the house cleaned up it's time for us to get ready for a miracle to happen you say well brother paul what kind of miracles are you expecting well i'll just let your imagination answer your question but i'm telling you my brother and sister us having rapturing faith in a world full of doubt and fear look at the last few months that we've had everything they peddled if you've looked at the news whether it be a television or online you know the cable stuff or wherever it might be fear fear fear fear fear you're going to die this is going to happen that's going to happen we're all going to be living on the streets this is the end of america this is the chaos my brother and sister i didn't include it i don't believe this morning but the prophet of god someone asked him hey minister what are we going to do about all these children and the prophet of god is talking there and he says you know what what we got to do is we got to get it to the state that we get this communist spirit you know because that's what the prophet of god said about russia right the catholicism opened the door amen the people got to the place that if this is god we don't want it and they went on i oh my brother and sister i'm just getting sidetracked but i tell you what happens is if we're not living christ in front of our house oh help us if we're not living christ in front of our house we'll wonder why our children become atheists and communists and whatever else's yeah see there's got to be something in the house that shows these children god is real nothing better than good parents amen nothing better than a church that god's alive and moving and the word of god is being brought forth in liberty hallelujah now look my brother and sister what's in the house well not handmade hath not anything in the house wonder what size that little pot of oil was what's it take to make a pot a voss as some would say vase if you're american balls i don't know how big she's got a pot of oil was this thing so big that our sister you know had to jack it up on a chair later to use it no my brother and sister you see little is big when god is in it we don't need some fantastics we need god in it hallelujah she says all i've got is this little pot of oil now let's follow these words for just a few minutes here amen the stage is being set because our god is in control so he tells her then makes no connection gives no explanation that would throw a lot of us right out because we would god to explain this to us before we could ever activate our faith to take a hold of this now i want to know why you want me to borrow all these vessels i want to know why i need to go to every neighbor and get not just a few i need to know what and what am i going to do with whatever you're going to do when it's all over so if you'll tell me i'll have enough faith to actually believe that you're going to do something no why don't we just get to the place we just believe the word amen when the word comes forth and says repent my brother and sister let's not go well do i really have oh this is a catch some people will stumble over this i don't have anything to repent for he didn't say find something to repent for he said repent i'm prayed through god was in my house this morning he was in the car with me on the way to church then lord you want me to repent lord forgive me of every shortcoming oh but we want an explanation i haven't sinned i don't need to repent forget about it just believe the word and repent lord if there be something that is buried in my life from years gone by that i overlooked lord anoint me i want to repent sweep the house lord sweep the house reminds me of a story i read once about this this lady there was a point to it i won't go into the whole story but this lady hired an elderly lady to clean her house the lady needed some extra help and uh income and so she hires this lady older lady to sweep the house but this lady had labored for her 80 some years of her life and and her back was kind of hunched and and she couldn't really straighten up and you know every day this lady went through the house she wiped down everything she washed everything she swept everything and one day this uh rich lady or the the lady of the house a friend come over and she said i don't know why you keep this woman because the floor is spotless but look at the cobwebs and the lady answered and said she is taking care of everything she can see god open our eyes open our eyes lord let there not be one hindrance that we would come with one thing we didn't see anyway going on in the story the lady says well well the cowboys or whatever and she said that's fine that's my fault i should have knocked him down yesterday you see my brother and sister you can't fix what you can't see and that's the same comes with revelation in the word of god you can't believe what you don't see amen god open our eyes open our eyes lord let us see it lord let our hearts believe it right hallelujah so it's there he tells her go borrow these vessels and uh of all your neighbors not just those you got along with that might have been awkward huh knock on the door of somebody you wasn't really friends with i know you and i don't get along too well but i need all the empty vessels in your house well you know there comes a time the anointing can you only imagine what egypt looked like when israel under that anointing pillaged the egyptians for their food their carts their ox and all of these things they went with the confidence hallelujah well let us not be afraid to knock on the door and say if you got an empty vessel inside of your house it needs to go to my house hallelujah because i got a miracle on the way i got a supernatural move of god coming to my house hallelujah amen borrow not a few and when thou art come in now look at this my brother and sister there's so many types in scripture that tie to this we're not going to go to them all this morning or even just a handful but my brother and sister you see the ark my brother and sister at the time of the flood the ark the door had to be shut before the blessings fell wait blessings that was a curse no it was only a curse my brother and sister to those that were outside the word everyone that was inside the word it was a blessing hallelujah it all depends on what you're looking at amen you get to looking at laodicea and how filthy it is well praise the lord you're getting an idea what sodom looked like amen we're not here to look at the the world out here and say oh oh oh horrible horrible you know what no my brother and sister we should be sighing and crying but you know what you ought to look at that because he said he's not coming back until the world looks like sodom that's a little hard to pray for isn't it lord let the world hurry up and look like sodom brings us to some paradoxes doesn't it i'll tell you what it does it breaks your heart when good people out here are caught and they think they're serving god you know it's kind of scary when you see brother branham talked 60 years ago how that that spirit would be such in the church that they would say well praise god i'm sealed i've got the holy ghost i can drink a little bit i can dance a little bit i can do all of these things and it don't bother me we are living in that day we are living i have got friends men that are good men they got good families they're caught up in a world that that they can go and drink smoke cigars dance all these kind of things and say i've got the holy ghost oh my brother and sister the prophet warned us said that you could be anointed in this flesh all the days of your life we need something deeper than just on this flesh we need something my brother and sister that can't be taken away hallelujah thou shalt shut the door you see now her being obedient to what elisha told her to do required that every portion now some would say you know this sounds like legalism in the church well that's good my brother and sister if you want to call it legalism that's fine but you'll find over and over again in the bible that god expected his word to be followed word by word amen we can't cut out a paragraph we can't rearrange it god wants it done the way god wants it done and so he tells her now when you come in shut the door upon thee and upon thy sons only them in the house as it were and shalt pour out into all those vessels now shall set aside that which is full so she went from him shut the door upon her and upon her sons who brought the vessels to her and she poured out oh now saints now don't get me wrong we have our ups and downs we have our days we have our struggles when's the last time you poured out that's it come on i'm not talking about just praying that's right i'm talking about when was the last time we poured out come on church let's get some rubber right down on the road so we can go somewhere amen if we're not pouring out saints we're not going to get filled back up right but if you don't pour out the oil just becomes stagnant oil you see oh i'm going to jump ahead of myself but i want to make the point right now you see elisha did not tell her to go fill the back patio full of jars of oil you see the oil would have ended up with pollywogs and all kinds of this and that and dust upon it or whatever so while the oil was fresh he tells it go sell the oil there are so many types we won't even be able to come close to touching them this morning but my brother and sister sons and daughters of god you and i this morning operate on the holy ghost you realize that we cannot go out here and feed on the things of the world and live a godly life we every time that we start putting something else in the vessel amen we end up sputtering and spitting and whatever else my brother and sister but when the oil is in the vessel then the life that is in the oil is in you and i and then we can live right through this most wicked time we don't have to cry say we're going to go hide in the mountains somewhere we can stand we can send our kids if you choose to send them to public school it's actually a waste because they've proven now that about 60 65 percent of the time in public school is used for other things other than educating your child so uh if you want to just waste a portion of your child's life you'll probably send them to public school but if you want to educate your child you'll probably have to bring them home amen and start teaching something based out of the bible and isn't that wonderful you can step right out the door and uh there is a little bit of flora and there's a little bit of fauna and there's a little bit of mountains and there's a cloud and there's a sun and a moon and there's stars and there's a river and there's a fish and a frog my goodness do we need to coop kids up in a building by somebody that don't even know their own gender to tell our kids they don't know their gender so that we can tell them that the world was come from moss on a pawn and a spontaneous spark come on my brother and sister it's about time we got a grip on what's happening out there amen you talk about the pond with the moss and the methane gas that is our public schools hallelujah and the spark that they got is there is no god and it doesn't matter what you are or what they do to you it's all good because we're free well bondage was considered ultimate freedom yeah look at the roman empire you'll find the perfect historical example the highest form of freedom we do anything we please and it killed them did i miss that point amen so what did she do she goes from the prophet now i didn't bring a message book out here with me but symbolically she goes from the prophet how far did she get not very far from the prophet why because she took his words in her heart she took his words in her mind and so she only could get as far away from as it were the prophet as far as she got away from the word so if she was in the word the word was in her then she was if you catch my point this morning she was in the prophet right she was right there with him amen and i tell you my brother and sister it don't apply any different you can't reject the message of this hour and say that you are in jesus christ because this message of this hour is jesus christ amen so as close as you state to the word is how close you'll be to christ hallelujah oh my so she went she shut the door upon her and her sons now my brother and sister if you want to talk about something that might catch the attention of a child is to see parents following the word exactly that's right don't tell me our kids aren't smart enough to figure this out we don't fool anybody in fact our kids in most cases have really got us wrapped around their finger because you know you've got my well we won't go there praise the lord we'll save that for another day so what she do closes the door her sons start bringing vessels to her you know what she started doing trying to figure out what was going on no she took her little pot of oil i'd pick that thing up except for i'll end up dumping them on the floor and then i'll have to clean up the mess and we'll just i don't know maybe it was about like that something that a sister could handle and her son imagine this is going to take faith saints this wasn't just something that she just went well praise the lord son throw it down here and we'll fill her up no the human sense said there's only this much oil the human sense would say i'm not sure what it would be that i'm going to pour the oil from my jar into this jar and from that jar into this jar you see that's where the human element would take us there's only so much oil oh but when you will just follow the word and say you know what god would not have brought this word would not have given me this word would not have opened this word up to me for me to sit down with some kind of mathematical formula to figure out how it would be because i can tell you what the mathematical formula would be as you poured the oil from vessel to vessel it would decrease because it would always leave a residue so if you're going to do this in the kernel you're going to decrease and decrease and decrease until all you've got is a bunch of vessels that got oil on them and a dropper two on the floor here and there but if you just take that word and you said you know what this is what god asked me to do he asked me to go repent get baptized amen he said he'd fill me with the holy ghost amen i'm just going to pour it out i'm just going to let it happen i'm going to see what god's got in store for me and she must have been there something happening oh my brother and sister something happening when she pours that first vessel full of oil and then she lifts it back up oh i don't know what her vessel looked like it might have if she had went by sight looked in there and there's no more oil in there you don't know i don't know man i don't think that vessel had to suddenly be bubbling out the top oh it might have been that she could have looked at my by walking by sight she might have said whoa i just poured it all out but wait i have this much and that vessel's full bring me another bring me another i need god to come on the scene he came on the scene yesterday i need him to come on the scene today i'm going to pour it out i'm gonna believe god is coming on this scene today i believe god's gonna move in my life today i believe god's will will be done today get more room for the holy ghost in their house oh hallelujah oh not i got this i got that my brother and sister let my house let your house be overflowing amen let every single vessel you can find oh hallelujah oh so what's happening here amen the word amen remember in the beginning was the word and the word was i think it's a funny funny little cartoon man's got a gun and he asked this other gentleman he says how do you how do you work at this thing what do you do he said you pointed at something and pulled the trigger and the guy says that's all and he said that's all my brothers and sister god's not going to self-destruct the bride of christ for following his directions exactly right so what does he tell her thou shall shut the door upon thee and upon their sons and shall pour out into all those vessels and now shall set aside that which is full amen he wasn't just telling her for the sake of convenience just pour a little into every vessel pour it full pour it full i know one just anointed by the holy ghost saints i don't believe you want to just be anointed by the holy ghost hey man we want god all the way down on the inside amen amen how's that song go jesus on the inside working on the outside hallelujah why fill it full don't settle for anything less than filling it full amen let's not go to church you say well brother paul times are tough sometimes life is tough we get discouraged i tell you i understand what discourage means i can't spell it but i can tell you what it feels like and i'll tell you my brother and sister but we don't come to church because we're going to be well if i can just get enough enough in my vessel then i'll go home and feel okay then if i'll make it to wednesday i'll be okay again what happens if you don't make it to wednesday amen what happens if your boss says i need you to work late now thursday you're a wreck friday your wreck saturday you're a wreck because you went a whole week without the vessel amen without the oil i mean in the vessel amen fill it full come on saints here this morning we can fill it full you don't have to have my permission you don't have to have anybody else's permission all you got to do is just let the vessel be filled up hallelujah oh my so she goes and she follows look at this she followed the word for her oh my brother and sister you see we don't all we have the same message but we don't have all the same word amen i wasn't called to be a housewife thank you lord the reason that the lioness takes care of the cubs because the king of the jungle tends to get a little rough sometimes amen there's a reason the reason and purpose of our being you say well brother paul i wished i was this or i wished i was that my brother and sister don't be telling god he was wrong don't be telling god he doesn't know what he's doing amen god made you who you are for a purpose and i can tell you whether your vessel is big or little it'll hold oil [Music] hallelujah fill it up fill it up hallelujah now brother branham says in the sermon speak to the rock this is quite lengthy so please if you can just focus and follow along god's given every sick person in here divine healing every one of you jesus was wounded for our transgressions with his stripes we were healed it's yours do we understand the value of possession my brother and sister it's yours but you'll have to fight for every inch you possess my oh my you mean god's just not going to pave the way well he might knock a few of those philistines out of the way for you but you're going to have to have the courage to face a few your own self yeah everywhere the souls of your feet travel of course this was only concerning joshua ryan come on saints are you guys trying to horn in on joshua's revelation ah there's the words i wanted to hear that's not joshua's revelation it wasn't brother trevor's revelation it wasn't any one of his revelation my brother and sister this revelation is good for you and i nobody's gonna say well i got that revelation first you can't have it no my brother and sister god promised me wherever these little feet walked in faith amen that i could claim that ground in the name of jesus christ everywhere the souls of your feet travel god told joshua joshua i have given you footsteps means possession let's move in tonight oh my brother and sister let's move in tonight amen let's go in footsteps is possession let's take every inch of the ground that god has given us if you haven't got the baptism of the holy ghost peter said the promise is unto you and to your children oh i bring this out my brother and sister because i want to just loop this right back around she was there she wasn't just worried about her children being bondsmen my brother and sister she knew what the world out there would do to her children and when they did come out of that debtor's prison as it were they wouldn't be the same they would be marked or they would be scarred they'd be changed in such a fashion he would not recognize him and she wasn't willing to give her children up to a system that would put any other mark than the mark of the holy ghost hallelujah no other mark we're refusing to allow any other mark to be placed upon that amen to them that's a far off any as many as the lord our god shall call footsteps is possession let's go get it it's ours well you know what i hear a lot of people now don't get me wrong i'm trying to be negative but i hear a lot of people say these words and no action behind it come on if footsteps are going to be possession my brother and sister we can't sit down on the job and say well praise the lord wherever i go spiritually whatever god does for me is going to be mine wait you haven't moved you haven't moved all you've got is a size 10 possession you don't have a land you don't have a nation you don't have a spiritual promise you've got a size 10 possession i need nothing to boast about especially when there's people around the saints that are marching forward you say well i don't know about them they act a little too spiritual for me but look what they're doing i'll tell you what they're doing my brother and sister and i might just do that with you here this morning because in the name of jesus christ i claim every one of you hallelujah you might say brother paul you're being presumptuous but i'm claiming that the holy ghost will fill grace tabernacle to overflowing let's get some more vessels let's get some more vessels let's claim this we don't have to sit here and say i hope maybe it will it could possibly be get up start claiming what god has already promised to you and i these are our children this is our heritage this is our church this is our message that god sent to this an hour in this hour my brother and sister it's not just god said i'll send a message and laodicea and it'll come and it'll do whatever he sent this message with your name on the address hallelujah oh hallelujah look at this footsteps is passion let's go get it it's yours jesus christ the same yesterday today and forever let's possess it the works that i do shall you do also you know i think most of us have actually set that portion of that scripture off so far that we couldn't hardly find it with a fishing pole and a big lead weight and a treble hook he said not very often i had a sense of humor i've caught a bicycle i've caught a couple tires i once snagged a carp my brother and sister that's not what god gave us this word for so we can just pitch it here and pitch it there and show everybody look how spiritual i am that's right no god gave us this word my brother and sister that we would catch eternal life that we would catch the very promises of god that we need for our children our family my brother and sister for whatever need that you have today maybe you just have courage right now in your own heart to lift it up to the lord and say lord i'm going to claim this the footsteps of possession it's healing a deliverance of this or that lord i'm claiming that amen i'm not going to just throw it around yeah they said i was healed they said i was healed i want to be healed that's my goal not to talk about it is to be it hallelujah the works that i do shall you also let's possess it it's god's promisehood hallelujah they could pray for you they could anoint you with a gallon of oil it won't do any good unless your faith rises up and says that was for me this message come in this loudest see in age it had my name on it no i'm not going to fight you about the postage on it my brother and sister but my name was on that address it was sent to me hallelujah whoa hallelujah yes amen lost myself where am i but then when it comes to the showdown when it comes to showdown are you able to possess the thing you profess to have that's it that's it come on amen it ain't the loudest it ain't the most flamboyant it's the one who says that's for me and i am taking that satan you know we all see these these bumper stickers about they can have my gun when they pry it from my cold dead fingers how about we turn that around and say satan amen you'll never pry this from michael dead fingers because i'm not afraid of the second death the second death has nothing to do with me because if i pass from this current life right here i'm passing right into the presence of my lord jesus christ and everything he ever said i would be i am at that moment hallelujah hallelujah amen that's the thing brother we've got to get it we've got to take it it's ours but oh my goodness why did the prophet have to put this quantifier in here why couldn't he have just said ask for it and we'll just give it to you you'll fight for every inch joshua a type of christ fought every inch of grass get in the spirit saints amen oh amen look at this now okay here we go whether there's giants whether there's atheists whether there's infidels where there's cold i can deal with infidels and i can deal cold formal church deacons will you make sure the pastor doesn't have a button make sure he's got a lifesaver because we got our whole sunday planned out to the minute and if he preaches too long today we're not going to be able to go down to our favorite mexican restaurant that's not open anyhow come on saints god's tired of our god's tired of it god's looking for some people that have enough courage to stand up and say you're talking about me it's me oh remember when the prophet was there at mishawaka remember when he samira's mission walker and that colored brother is sitting there beside him here he is here he is hallelujah how about we get to the place we're so anointed of god that we'd be going saints are you looking for the holy ghost here he is he's right here he's on the front oh oh he's on the second row he's on the third to fourth to fifth the sixth oh he's here now some people say oh paul's went nuts again well i want to go nut amen because i'll tell you one thing as long oh somebody will probably gripe at this but look as long as god would allow me you as the people led of god will allow me to be the pastor we will not slide into a cold formal church i will come and i will grab your hands and i will shake you out of your seat if i have to but we are not going to become some cold formal yep the prophet said it i believe it it might come to pas i mean it'll come to pass come on look we're going to be cold and formal i recommend we all become mormons or at least pentecostals pentecostals are are more exciting the mormons have a much better church supported financial system though they'll own you money for a house a farm anything you know because if you don't pick the payments they get to repossess it it's theirs anyhow you just took care of it for them but if you want to get excited let's go be pentecostals we might run around around and round and round and not figure out where we went that's right come on saints i am trying to be a little funny i want to shake you out of your deal we were called to be cold and formal brother paul you just don't know my circumstance i don't but god does amen why don't you ask god to shake the bat out of the belfry hallelujah don't want bats in the belfry get god to shake the bell free run the bats off hallelujah god give the promise let's take it it's ours it belongs to us it's our possession let's go get it don't be afraid don't stay back and say well i believe the days of miracles past oh i don't know don't do that don't look like a that don't look like a child of abraham no matter how far along the promise seemed to hold out well it went on talking about abraham went on for 25 years but instead of abraham getting weaker he got stronger all the time for he knowed it would be a greater miracle all the time well ask the lord for healing don't be sitting there saying well i haven't got my healing got my healing my brother and sister know that as the days go by it will be a greater miracle amen you say well brother paul i i would like that now of course we would we live in the day of the instant you know i watched this preacher here recently just a little something i happened to come across and he made an awesome point and and uh if i'd have thought of this i would have brought my phone out here and he held up his cell phone pulled it out of his back pocket you know how these skinny jeans preachers are you know go lift weights right before you go to church so your arms are pumped up wear your son's t-shirt your skinny jeans come out that was probably a bad image pulls his phone out he made an awesome point though pulls his phone out he said we live in such an instant age and all over the church lord i want healed no trust no patience he knowed it would be a greater miracle all the time oh hallelujah hallelujah my brother and sister that's what god's doing amen imagine how that little lady felt that little sister felt her arms are getting tired her mind is thinking well this is enough this is enough but he told her to keep filling them full she kept right on filling them full and her sons got involved they got to see the hand of god moving they got to see a miracle unfolding they got to see the word of the prophet coming to pass you know the problem we have saints this way too many people have just enough personal doubts about what they believe that their children pick up on that that's right you know what they say now i know we're headed a little random here forgive me did they say that a dog and a horse can both sense your fear i remember one time a guy walked up to this dog the owner says whoa he bites and the guy said this dog ain't biting me walked right up grabbed that dog by the scruff of the neck started wrestling around the guy's life there was a guy with him and said cool he ain't biting me either yeah that guy landed on the other side of that four foot fence that dog invited me from out here [Laughter] come on saints if we believe it let's make sure parents come on parents listen to me if we believe it make sure your children know you believe it live it in front of them tell them this is the truth and this is why it's truth it isn't truth because i said so it isn't truth because brother branham said so it's truth because the word of god said so and we stand on the word we believe the word we are the word and watch it children i'm going to keep pouring kids you just keep believing you keep believing children that god's in the miracle-working business god is in the saving business god is in the healing business god is in the delivering business hallelujah hallelujah what was she doing my brother and sister she was applying the promise she wasn't there oh i'm pouring out another a jug of oil here i sure hope this works i don't know what i'm doing with this you know what at the point i don't think she had a clue that's why i think she went back to the prophet and said i you know i'm just going to make up a number i've got a hundred vessels of oil in my house what do i do now well i tell you what you do because now i hope you catch this time the holy ghost is what fuels you and i that's why you can't get one filling and just go on and on and on and on you've got to have another refilling another refilling for years i have typed it to the car imagine we're going to go to chicago amen we jump even in brother david or brother bob's a little prius amen why you know they make i i burn more gas starting my vehicles than they do driving around town but we won't get in their car and think we are driving to chicago without filling up the tank that's what the holy ghost is fill up the tank fill up the vessel live life to the fullest stop fill up the vessel live life to the fullest again stop fill up the vessel hallelujah i've said this for years that this young people especially this i find it very responsive in in south america young people i tell them you can be almost anything on this earth that you want to be and serve god there's a few jobs um we all know obviously you're not going to take and serve god you want to build the airplane you're going to serve god you want to fly the airplane you can serve god you want to jump out of the airplane you can serve god you want to be a brain surgeon i remember one meeting i said you can be a brain surgeon this young man jumped up and said hallelujah that's what i want to be brother paul okay finally after all the meetings i found somebody that actually wanted to be my brother and sister just make sure the vessel is full the oil is sufficient okay let me hurry let me let me hurry here oh my let me just go right on down here do you realize now i just want to make this point do you realize that she was pouring out the miracle was growing by the moment now the word doesn't show us how many vessels but it's irrelevant because she had a little jar and now she's filling vessels over and over and over again hallelujah i get excited thinking about that amen oh now look i said this earlier but this is really where it was at my notes little is big when god is in it look we're now in our sister's house we're looking you know what we see oil right she's pouring oil vessel to vessel to vessel but if we looked at it from god's eyes that house would have been clear full of the shekinah glory of god angels would have been present they would have been there what would it was it oil in the house no he's in the house he's in the house there's where the difference at he's in the house my brother and sister you need a miracle in your life you need a miracle in your family you got a circumstance you think is just unfixable and curable or one whatever get him in the house amen don't sit there and say well if if get him in the house amen hallelujah and when the vessels were full she said unto her son bring me yet a vessel and he said unto her there is not a vessel more and the oil stayed in other words it's saying there that the oil my brother and sister i believe i might be interpreting the scripture forgive me if i am i don't mean it for any other reason but i believe when she finally got done she looked back in the very original vessel and it had the same exact amount of oil it never diminished and she looked around if she had walked from room to room every single vessel that she got completely full was still completely oh hallelujah man i tell you what i'd like to preach to that household because everywhere you went there would have been oil hallelujah they'd have been the holy ghost everywhere you went now look at this i i want to just go a minute longer here amen look it's come to a place friend i shared this quote wednesday night i

coming to a time where impersonations and carnal thinking is going to be circumcised from the real true body of christ see what's happening are ideas my brother and sister that god will do this and god will do that and we can do this and we can do that god's trimming them away amen he's cutting us right back to the true word amen not to a man-made theology not to a tradition amen not to be message whatever's you know hyphenated i'm a message mormon i'm a message baptist i'm a message methodist no my brother and sister cutting us right back to jesus christ the message amen so you look at that now and he says here so it's coming a time where impersonations carnal thinking is going to be circumstance circumcised from the real true body of christ and he's going to have a body that's pure and holy and their vessels are going to be clear full filled with his spirit walking in his spirit it's one thing be filled with it my brother and sister but let's walk in it amen walking in the spirit doing the works that he did be faithful to that amen i don't know about you but when i read these words those have great emphasis it really does this is what you're doing being filled and walking in it and walking in his spirit be faithful to that satan's gonna do everything i'll tell you since wednesday night the wheels fell off the wagon around our place the devil didn't like us preaching what we preached at all my brother and sister but i tell you sons and daughters of god are going to walk in the liberty amen amen we're in we have been set free amen we didn't walk into something to walk right back out and put that you notice out in the foyer of grace tabernacle there's no place to hang your yoke that's right that's right and there's no bull bill wep out there either amen so there's nobody going to drive you to live this life you're going to come out here and say you know what that yoke wasn't no good god's going to swell you up with the holy ghost and that yolk's going to break right off and you're not ever going to let them put it back on you hallelujah hallelujah oh my oh my oh my be faithful to that want something real they're hungering and thirsting to find the real thing they don't want psychology do you want psychology oh i didn't think so they don't want some intellectual speech boy you'd fire me in a heartbeat if you did wouldn't you amen they want something that gives them the assurance something that makes this bible live again hallelujah sister hallelujah that's what we're looking for something that makes this bible live again oh hallelujah can you imagine my brother and sister in such a short time this sister by going back now look it all depends on how you view it some people get nervous about these things i myself for years have been had been are kind of a little nervous when people start doing this but sometimes you just see how god's word is so what did she do she went back to the prophet elisha the prophet elisha was not god but he was god's point of contact for her and we had a point of contact in our day that brought a word my brother and sister we cannot go to him he has gone from the scene but the word and the message that he himself said that jesus christ amen is our prophet oh so what are we doing we're going to our prophet and he's giving us guidance and imagine she goes in such a short time talk about the power of the word she goes from such a short time her children going to be taken by the creditor to become bondsmen to completely free and not only that god gives sufficiency for her to live off of going forward she didn't wake up the next morning and say lord what are we going to do about today no god solved that problem he said i filled my holy ghost up in you amen it seeped into the very fiber of your being it cannot be separated not even with fire not even with force no hallelujah i'll tell you how sure it is when people ask the prophet of god questions about what would happen to those that were buried in the sea and those that were burnt up and he said what will happen is i'm paraphrasing it those ashes those molecules come right up out of that sea they'll come every one of them because they know their place in the body it wasn't just flesh it was flesh of his flesh it wasn't bone it was bone of his bone god can no more forsake himself saints he could no more forsake you and i than he could forsake himself because we have become flesh of his flesh and bone of his bone we are jesus christ but if it's down in your bones it's down in your heart and soul it's down in the fiber of your being when he calls that word home right down to the very morrow of our bones right into the very depths of our soul and i just read where the prophet of god said you might not even be leaving just quite right but god sees your heart and he oh my brother and sister if we are off i have confidence now look a individual shared with me here the other days thought i kind of have a little bit of a more liberal view on we can't be deceived and we're just we're talking just having a conversation and i shared with him i said brother no i don't have a liberal point of view i have confidence [Music] i have confidence god won't let me be deceived oh it ain't what paul's gonna do paul can be deceived paul can be deceived but oh get the holy ghost inside of me get the holy ghost inside of you immerse us to the morrow of our bones and the oil of the holy ghost and you will not be deceived because god could not forsake his own word oh hallelujah well it's that holy ghost and fire and it's keeping me alive oh keeping me alive [Music] oh jesus is keeping me alive oh don't you love it it's all over me and it's bubbling up inside all bubbling up inside yes it's bubbling up inside well it's all over me and it's bubbling up inside oh jesus is keeping me alive for it sanctifies me holy and it's keeping me alive oh keeping me alive yes it's keeping me alive for it sanctifies me holy and it's keeping me alive yes it's keeping me alive well i prayed it down from heaven and it's keeping me alive why jesus is keeping me alive hallelujah hallelujah thank you lord hallelujah you know this world we live in will suck the life right out here i'm thankful god keeps pouring something back inside of me hallelujah you know i just want to just thinking about this song this lady this sister amen he paid a debt he did not owe elisha could have just said well god will be with your sons [Music] he'll protect them in their time of bondage and in the permissible will of god they'll come one day and be free again [Music] no god said this is what i send prophets on the scene for to set my children free hallelujah sometimes i use the supernatural and sometimes i use the supernatural and when i say that there actually is a difference you see she had to pour tangible oil out of a vessel into other vessels and when this was all over she had to carry that oil down to the marketplace and she had to sell it or the supernatural might have been when the debtor creditor opened his book one day a page was gone and so is the memory of it amen hallelujah god chose to use that supernatural himself and said i can't even find it it's gone the sea of my forgetfulness it's gone oh hallelujah are you with me saints see god could have said well i'll just make a for you and i'll do this and i'll do that no no god said what i'm going to do is all you got to do is just repent just get baptized and then step forward in confidence lord i want the holy ghost you see we've got to we've got to be a bowl of jelly and we've got to be so contrite but you see there's a degree of confidence sense that we as sons and daughters of god should have he said oh could we practice that the lord said the lord said the lord said his word said his word said his word said [Music] oh hallelujah well he paid a debt he paid i could not pay i need someone to wash my sins away i now can sing a brand new grace all day long christ jesus paid a debt that i could never pay [Music] he cleans my soul and set me free i'm glad that jesus did all my sins embraced i now can a brand new song amazing
