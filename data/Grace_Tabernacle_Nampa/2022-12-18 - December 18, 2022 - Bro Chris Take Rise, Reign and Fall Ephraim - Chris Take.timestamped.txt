[13:04] where we've come to
[13:06] it's been amazing
[13:07] so I thank you for being a part of the
[13:09] of the worship
[13:11] it's an important part
[13:14] um I've had I've had people say well why
[13:16] do we have song service let's just have
[13:18] the word
[13:19] uh you don't read your Bible
[13:22] it's important why we have worship why
[13:26] we have song Service uh for one
[13:29] um I had one one person asked me says
[13:31] well why don't you open in prayer before
[13:32] we start I said because you're not ready
[13:34] to open in prayer before we start and
[13:36] there's a reason for that it's a singing
[13:39] calms a spirit
[13:41] it puts us in that right atmosphere and
[13:44] whoever the Lord raises up to take this
[13:46] spot
[13:47] and if you have that on your heart and
[13:49] you believe in God it's called you to do
[13:50] that remember this
[13:52] his worship is extremely important
[13:55] when we come to church
[13:58] we just don't just pick songs to sing
[14:00] songs
[14:01] we pick songs
[14:04] to create it that's right brother Tim
[14:05] create an atmosphere so that when the
[14:07] word comes the seed that's in here
[14:10] is open and ready to accept
[14:12] the fertilizer
[14:14] and then what we need to grow
[14:16] so I I do want to say and I wish brother
[14:18] Paul and sister Jerry we're here right
[14:20] now but they're not I'll get my
[14:22] opportunity to talk to them when they
[14:23] get back

[14:27] know the Lord brought us here for this
[14:29] purpose for this time

[32:50] over every situation give me the world

[33:17] so that the whole world can hear it will
[33:22] change our lives forever give me the
[33:26] world
[33:28] give me the word
[33:32] make it plain and clear to me give me

[34:26] word let's all stand oh give me the
[34:30] world

[34:37] foreign
[34:39] [Music]
[35:17] it's my totally victory
[35:22] everything
[35:32] amen
[35:34] big song to come out to
[35:36] amen praise the Lord
[35:41] maybe maybe we'll sing that course again
[35:43] you can sit down
[35:45] we got some announcements but we'll sing
[35:48] that again that way before we go into
[35:50] the preaching of the word but
[35:51] um so I talked to brother Paul yesterday
[35:53] he called me
[35:55] um and uh everything is going really
[35:57] well
[35:58] just just shared a few testimonies with
[36:01] me what God's done and the young people
[36:03] and and um if even just one of those
[36:06] testimonies was all that came out of
[36:08] that
[36:09] um just my goodness it would be
[36:11] everything would be worth it
[36:13] um they just the whole Trip's been a
[36:15] whirlwind or you heard from brother
[36:16] Trevor last Sunday and
[36:18] busy busy busy in Israel and then busy
[36:20] busy busy in South Africa so they're
[36:23] they're uh getting the end of the Rope I
[36:25] think tired wise but God's really
[36:28] speaking through him and doing great
[36:31] things today and and uh probably now I
[36:34] don't know how far ahead of time they
[36:35] are they're not too far ahead
[36:37] um because he called me yesterday
[36:38] morning it was the afternoon there so
[36:40] they're probably right in the middle of
[36:42] the service they were not going to have
[36:44] a afternoon service but brother Gideon
[36:46] felt led to so whenever God whenever you
[36:49] hear God's servants they're feeling LED
[36:50] and I'm gonna do this saying you watch
[36:52] God's gonna do something so we just want
[36:54] to in our prayers
[36:56] remember that service that's
[36:58] particularly
[36:59] God is probably giving someone a chance
[37:03] to receive something another opportunity
[37:06] to receive what they've that they've
[37:08] come for so he he said tell everyone
[37:10] hello that loves you and misses you
[37:13] um
[37:14] and also we thank you for your prayers
[37:17] as we traveled our trip ended up being a
[37:20] week instead of a weekend but we had a
[37:23] wonderful time with Brother John Andy's
[37:25] group there in in Washington last
[37:27] weekend but they're Steve Clark sends
[37:30] his greetings as I'm sure brother John
[37:31] does as well but brother John was over
[37:33] in New Zealand he's still over there
[37:37] and um
[37:39] so he says they send their greetings
[37:41] tell everyone hello I also spoke with
[37:43] brother Jose and he wanted me to tell
[37:45] you all hello from from Tri-Cities area
[37:46] so
[37:48] um but uh Brother Rich Cobb and brother
[37:50] Vlad
[37:51] and brother they they send their
[37:54] greetings as well but if black came for
[37:56] Camp here from Brother Rich's last
[37:59] summer so he said tell everybody hello
[38:01] so
[38:02] um but Brother Rich as well since his
[38:03] greetings amen again I I believe that
[38:06] God spoke both places and and his word
[38:09] will not return to him void
[38:11] amen so we also I also yesterday when I
[38:14] was on the phone
[38:15] one of the reasons he called uh
[38:18] yesterday but Paul was about the
[38:20] Christmas day service so uh he's decided
[38:23] we'll have a Christmas day service uh
[38:25] Sunday morning regular time
[38:27] um no one's obligated to come
[38:30] uh but when the pastor says that
[38:33] I'm kidding I'm kidding
[38:36] um
[38:37] so looking forward to that time together
[38:40] amen let's sing that course again give
[38:43] me the word and then we will
[38:45] get into the sermon this morning give me
[38:48] the word
[38:51] make it plain and clear to me
[38:56] [Music]
[39:10] over everything

[40:07] enough right on time that we were able
[40:10] to speak Wednesday night Thursday
[40:12] and this morning so you pray for me
[40:14] still but
[40:15] uh my son Jackson he
[40:19] said I don't want to go to church this
[40:20] morning
[40:21] and I said you know sometimes me and Mom
[40:23] don't want to go to church but we go
[40:24] anyways
[40:26] and we never regret it
[40:30] I said do you want to give the devil a
[40:31] black eye do you want to chop his head
[40:33] off do you want to run him through and
[40:35] you know first he was saying no and I
[40:38] said well
[40:39] the best way to do that is to go to
[40:40] church
[40:41] and so we always getting ready of 30
[40:44] minutes later something he comes in all
[40:45] dressed for church and he says Dad I
[40:46] want to stab the devil
[40:51] so praise the Lord you're here this
[40:53] morning
[40:54] amen you're giving the devil a black eye
[40:56] praise the Lord why don't we turn in our
[40:58] Bibles to Hosea
[41:01] Jose 14 verse 9.
[41:08] been listening to the sermon Brother
[41:10] David preached last Sunday and enjoying
[41:13] it
[41:14] tremendously I purposely did not touch
[41:16] Wednesday night because I didn't want to
[41:18] know what he preached
[41:23] so I wouldn't get in my way in the way
[41:25] of me this morning because I could say
[41:27] well I had no idea what he preached so
[41:31] God's God's uh just gave me this
[41:34] direction
[41:35] Friday or a couple days ago whatever it
[41:38] was and
[41:41] there's a quote where brother Branham
[41:42] says when he when he gets a sermon sorry
[41:45] I'm
[41:48] Jose let me just get to my spot in the
[41:51] scriptures here
[41:53] Isaiah chapter 14.
[42:07] the Lord lay this on my heart and but
[42:09] remember says he makes a quote where he
[42:11] says I get my my sermons through prayer
[42:13] and then they pray a little more and a
[42:15] little more and then it keeps coming
[42:16] closer and closer and
[42:18] so I just sorry are you sure Lord is
[42:20] this it I don't want to re-speak
[42:23] of what I've already spoken but then as
[42:25] you begin to open it up it turned and
[42:28] and right there in line with so just
[42:30] pray the Lord have his way this morning
[42:33] Hey Man Hosea 14 verse 9.
[42:37] who is wise and he shall understand
[42:40] these things
[42:42] prudent and he shall know them for the
[42:44] ways of the Lord are right and the just
[42:47] shall walk in them
[42:49] but the transgressors shall fall therein
[42:52] 8 14 Same Same Book
[43:00] sorry I'm trying to catch the mic best I
[43:02] can probably gonna have to do that a few
[43:05] times
[43:08] well no I'm not going to claim that the
[43:10] Lord's going to come
[43:12] Jose chapter 8 verse 14.
[43:15] for Israel hath forgotten it's really
[43:17] good to be home by the way I love
[43:19] preaching to you people
[43:20] it's good to preach in the home pulpit
[43:23] it's a lot more relaxing
[43:26] nothing against we stream see so you say
[43:28] stuff and then you stream and then
[43:30] people see that nothing against going I
[43:32] feel at home at other places as well but
[43:36] I believe everyone just everyone
[43:37] understands the home Church okay just
[43:41] preach Chris okay Jose 8 chapter 8 verse
[43:44] 14 for Israel hath forgotten his maker
[43:48] and build his temples and Judah hath
[43:50] multiplied fenced cities
[43:52] but I will send a fire upon his City
[43:54] cities and it shall Devour the Palaces
[43:57] thereof
[43:58] so this verse here is where I get my
[44:00] subtitle so I'll give you my title this
[44:01] morning
[44:02] and I did it in such a way because I
[44:04] made
[44:05] do more Wednesday night on the same kind
[44:08] of thing but
[44:11] um
[44:13] the rise rain and fall
[44:16] Ephraim
[44:18] and my subtitle is forget not thy maker
[44:23] Deuteronomy chapter 4.
[44:27] so I wrote the title in that in such a
[44:29] way that we wanted to bring more
[44:31] Wednesday night we could same con uh
[44:37] continuity Deuteronomy chapter 4
[44:51] Deuteronomy 4 verse 1.
[45:01] thank you
[45:02] now therefore hearken o Israel unto the
[45:04] statutes and then to the judgments which
[45:06] I teach you for to do them that you may
[45:09] live and go in and possess the land
[45:11] which the Lord God of your fathers
[45:12] giveth you you shall not add unto the

[45:39] your God are alive every one of you this
[45:42] day

[47:14] but ye that did cleave unto the Lord
[47:16] your God are alive every one of you
[47:19] this day
[47:22] so we were the story referenced here
[47:26] this morning is is the is the Feast of
[47:28] belpure
[47:30] and I wanna I would allow me to lay a
[47:33] foundation this morning
[47:35] before we step into our our subject
[47:39] rise Reign and fall of Ephraim
[47:42] in Numbers chapter 25 we can read the
[47:45] story and we have a lot of scriptures
[47:47] this morning and I I pulled out all I
[47:50] could
[47:51] and uh as we go you know the Lord
[47:54] sometimes brings it a certain way and
[47:55] maybe we won't have to read it each one
[47:58] exactly but If he if he does well that's
[48:01] just how he's planned it this morning
[48:05] Numbers chapter 25
[48:09] and that yeah amen number chapter 25. an
[48:13] Israel Abode in in shitam and the people
[48:16] begin to commit whoredom with the
[48:18] daughters of Moab and they called the
[48:21] people unto the sacrifices of their gods
[48:22] and the people did eat and bowed down to
[48:25] their gods
[48:27] and Israel joined himself unto Bell peor
[48:30] and the anger of the Lord was kindled
[48:32] against Israel
[48:34] pior was a a God in of Baal
[48:39] and this was a feast they were that they
[48:41] were having
[48:42] and the Lord said unto Moses take all
[48:43] the heads of the people and hang them up
[48:45] before the Lord against the son that the
[48:48] fierce anger of the Lord may be turned
[48:50] away from Israel and Moses said
[48:53] unto the judges
[48:55] of Israel slay ye every met everyone his
[48:57] men that were joined unto belpure
[49:00] everyone who committed fornication
[49:04] and behold one of the children of Israel
[49:06] came and brought unto the his Brethren
[49:08] Brethren a midianitish woman
[49:11] in the sight of Moses and in the sight
[49:13] of all the congregation of the children
[49:15] of Israel who were weeping before the
[49:16] door of the Tabernacle of the
[49:18] congregation
[49:20] and when Phineas the son of Eliezer the
[49:22] son of Aaron the priest saw it he rose
[49:24] up from among the congregation and he
[49:26] took a javelin in his hand and he went
[49:28] after the men of Israel unto the tent
[49:31] and thrust both of them through
[49:33] the man of Israel and the woman through
[49:35] her belly
[49:36] so the plague was stayed from the
[49:38] children of Israel
[49:39] and those that died in the plague
[49:43] were twenty and four thousand
[49:45] and the Lord spake unto Moses saying
[49:47] Phineas the son of Eliezer the son of
[49:49] Aaron the priest hath turned my wrath
[49:51] away from the children of Israel
[49:53] while he was zealous for my sake so why
[49:56] did Phineas run her through at the
[49:58] valley why didn't he run her through in
[49:59] the heart
[50:02] because the problem was the seed she
[50:05] carried
[50:07] because if you read this story through
[50:12] they go and they attack Midian after
[50:15] this
[50:16] and then they they bring back women and
[50:18] children
[50:20] and and Moses says go kill why did you
[50:23] bring them back he said this is what
[50:24] caused the problem to begin with
[50:27] he said go kill all the women
[50:29] who have who have known a man and all
[50:31] women who are pregnant and all the
[50:33] children
[50:34] and then keep the rest you can keep the
[50:36] rest
[50:38] because it's the seed amen those arrests
[50:41] they kept that was God's plan they were
[50:43] Sanctified totally different situation
[50:45] but this seed Phineas runs the
[50:49] her through in the belly because it's
[50:51] the seed brought forth a fornication of
[50:53] God's people God's word mixed
[50:57] with belpure mixed with that spirit
[51:01] this is so this is this is how
[51:05] this is how God looks at this yes sir
[51:08] and that and that's what I that's my
[51:10] heart this morning is to see
[51:13] to look into this
[51:15] why why did we talk about this why do we
[51:18] why do we preach on belpure and mention
[51:20] this feast and Balaam and all of these
[51:22] things and what is Brother Brad I'm so
[51:23] heavily talk about it in the church age
[51:26] book
[51:28] and I pray that God will bring us down
[51:30] to the very core of that this morning
[51:33] so he gives Phineas his Covenant of
[51:36] peace
[51:39] anytime you take the word of God and you
[51:41] apply it in your life God gives you the
[51:42] Covenant of peace
[51:47] so
[51:50] I think we can we get so let's finish
[51:53] let's let's finish the chapter it just
[51:54] lays it out so well
[51:56] 13 verse 13 and he shall have it in his
[51:58] seat after him even the Covenant of an
[52:01] everlasting priesthood because he was
[52:03] zealous for his God and made an
[52:05] atonement for the children of Israel
[52:07] now the name of the Israelite that was
[52:09] slain even that was slain with the
[52:11] midianitish woman was zimmri the son of
[52:13] Salu a pre Prince of of a chief house
[52:16] among the simianites and the name of the
[52:19] midianitish woman that was slain was
[52:21] Cosby the daughter of Zur he was head
[52:23] over a people and a chief of a chief
[52:25] house in Midian and the Lord spake unto
[52:27] Moses saying Vex the midianites and
[52:29] smite them
[52:30] for they Vex you with their Wiles
[52:32] wherewith they have beguiled you
[52:34] in the matter of pior and in the matter
[52:36] of Cosby the daughter of a prince of
[52:38] Midian their sister which was slain in
[52:41] the day of the plague for Pure sake
[52:44] numbers 31.
[52:48] Numbers Chapter 31. so there's a story
[52:50] we have it we read it now you don't have
[52:52] an you don't have an excuse
[52:55] we've read this story
[52:57] sometimes
[53:00] praise the Lord
[53:04] you got to go read the story you got to
[53:06] go read it for yourself
[53:07] in the Bible when you when you hear it
[53:10] preached about and the story is not read
[53:13] when you hear a preached about go back
[53:15] and read it for yourself because many
[53:17] times as a minister and study I'll go
[53:20] back and I'll read even though I can
[53:21] tell you the story I go back and read it
[53:23] because there's always something there
[53:24] you missed
[53:26] always something that you missed
[53:28] uh numbers 31 verse 1 and the Lord spake
[53:31] unto Moses saying Avenge the children of
[53:33] Israel of the midianites afterwards
[53:36] shalt thou be gathered unto thy people
[53:38] Moses's last big fight you think wow
[53:41] he's going to die right after this it
[53:43] says that Moses went to the mountain he
[53:45] never died
[53:47] he was translated and Amma to the very
[53:50] last moment here on Earth they said his
[53:53] strength never waned his Vigor never
[53:55] lacked he was strong as the day he was
[53:58] as the day he became a man
[54:01] I'm unbelievable
[54:03] amen so gather unto thy people and Moses
[54:06] spake unto the people saying arm some of
[54:08] yourselves unto the unto the war and let
[54:11] them go against the midianites and
[54:13] avenge of the Lord of Midian
[54:15] of every tribe of a thousand throughout
[54:19] all the tribes of Israel shall you
[54:20] ascend to the war so there were
[54:22] delivered out of the thousands of Israel
[54:24] a thousand of every tribe twelve
[54:26] thousand armed for war
[54:28] and Moses sent them to the war a
[54:30] thousand of every tribe them and Phineas
[54:33] the son of elieza the priest to the war
[54:35] with the Holy instruments and the in and
[54:38] the and the trumpets to blow in his hand
[54:40] and they Ward against the midianites as
[54:43] the Lord commanded Moses and they slew
[54:45] all the males
[54:48] no no more seed no more seed and they
[54:52] slew the things of Midian beside the
[54:54] rest of them that were slain namely El
[54:56] Eevee and Zur and her and Reba even five
[55:02] Kings of Midian Balaam also the son of
[55:06] bior they slew with the sword
[55:08] okay
[55:11] so
[55:12] this quote here and and I don't I don't
[55:15] try to get
[55:17] don't try to be over spiritual and get
[55:19] weird
[55:21] yesterday I was studying this out and
[55:23] and at the core of this it's
[55:25] Christianity versus idolatry and I was
[55:27] studying it out and I found this quote
[55:29] from Christianity versus idolatry and he
[55:32] preached it on December 17th
[55:34] and I was studying this out yesterday
[55:37] and I just was like Wow Lord
[55:40] so he says he says numbers 25
[55:44] give the guys a chance
[55:46] we see whether it matters anything to
[55:49] God or not
[55:51] let's see if it does whether these
[55:53] Creeds dogmas and so forth doesn't
[55:55] matter he is a good god he just
[55:57] overlooks the whole thing he doesn't
[55:59] he lays a line and draws a plummet and
[56:03] you've got to come to it
[56:05] he reads numbers and then he goes on to
[56:07] say he says
[56:08] or he I think he reads this chapter slay
[56:10] every one of them God wants to be God
[56:14] and if he ain't God he ain't going to be
[56:17] second place he don't have to let Baal
[56:20] and some man-made dogma and some theory
[56:23] of some man or some idea of a Creed or
[56:25] some idea of a denomination stand in his
[56:29] way he's God and he's able of these
[56:32] stones to rise children to Abraham you
[56:35] don't have to have your denomination you
[56:38] don't have to have your big societies
[56:40] and your schools and things he takes
[56:43] what he can get in his hand
[56:45] that's nothing breeds the breath of life
[56:48] into it and it becomes something that'll
[56:51] serve him
[56:52] so that's what he did to you and I
[56:54] that's what makes it him God
[56:57] certainly it matters to God the
[57:01] foundation I want to lay is moab's
[57:03] Israel's fall at the face develop your
[57:06] why did it matter so much to God or show
[57:09] you why show you that it mattered so
[57:11] much to God it was his people which is
[57:15] his word
[57:17] mixed
[57:19] mixed with a seed that started in
[57:22] fornication
[57:23] Moab was the son of of lot and his
[57:26] daughter
[57:28] and then they they fell in idolatry
[57:34] and in that falling they brought forth
[57:36] seed of idolatry
[57:40] and the man that caused them to do that
[57:43] was Balaam and God slew him
[57:47] why is it listed in the Bible Balaam
[57:49] died because God wants to show us this
[57:52] is how I feel about it
[57:53] I feel very strongly about it and this
[57:57] is why it's in the message over and over
[57:59] and over again
[58:01] God hates idolatry
[58:07] so now we see what God did with Moab
[58:11] in the situation
[58:14] that lays our foundation but we want so
[58:16] we want to now we want to talk about
[58:18] Ephraim what happened with Ephraim
[58:23] First Kings chapter 12.
[58:37] all right
[58:40] you can turn the Bible the physical book
[58:44] into an idol
[58:48] that's the point I'm not I don't want to
[58:50] make a point about
[58:51] you know working out too much or or food
[58:55] or or your car as an idol I don't want
[58:58] to talk about that
[59:00] I want to go deep down to the very root
[59:03] of the problem
[59:05] you can turn the Bible the physical book
[59:07] into an idol when you mix it
[59:09] and you take away the power of Christ
[59:13] that's what happened
[59:16] the power of God
[59:18] was removed because Israel mixed amen
[59:23] with idolatry that's right you can turn
[59:26] the message brother Branham
[59:28] and we know this
[59:31] you can turn brother branometer an idol
[59:33] you can turn the message into an idol
[59:35] when you mix it
[59:37] and take out what happened as soon as
[59:40] you mix it
[59:41] there's no more power of God there's no
[59:44] more power of Christ it's not just the
[59:47] physical book because lots of people
[59:49] have the book
[59:50] it's not the the message lots of people
[59:53] have the message
[59:54] it's the power of Christ through the
[59:57] word of God
[59:58] which is Anointed
[1:00:01] which is anointed word that can only
[1:00:04] continue to channel into your life
[1:00:06] continue can can continue to bring you
[1:00:10] into the statue of the perfect man
[1:00:12] continue to bring you into a position in
[1:00:15] the bride of Christ
[1:00:16] when it's not mixed amen not mixed with
[1:00:19] your opinion or any other preacher's
[1:00:21] opinion it's God's complete and holy
[1:00:25] word
[1:00:28] so Ephraim what is it what did Ephraim
[1:00:30] do you say Ephraim he's he's the ox he
[1:00:33] was on the
[1:00:34] I can't remember which side of the
[1:00:36] Tabernacle
[1:00:38] West or something at something along
[1:00:40] along those lines North or whatever
[1:00:43] North anyways you can go look it up but
[1:00:45] he was one of the guards the main
[1:00:48] Ephraim was there Ephraim was was was
[1:00:50] blessed instead of Manasseh
[1:00:52] but those situations were examples but
[1:00:56] Ephraim as a tribe what happened first
[1:00:59] Kings chapter 12.
[1:01:02] that's right
[1:01:07] well the preacher the people want to say
[1:01:11] well the preacher you know the church I
[1:01:12] went to they they caused this
[1:01:17] they'd say oh well Solomon taxed the
[1:01:19] people too hard so then what of course
[1:01:21] were you born what is he supposed to do
[1:01:22] in the in the Kingdom splits
[1:01:24] every person is given their own
[1:01:27] choices
[1:01:29] and you answer for yourself
[1:01:31] not anybody else and if you can cleave
[1:01:34] unto the word of God
[1:01:36] when though when they fall to Bell pure
[1:01:38] when they fall to their judgment
[1:01:40] you will be standing with God
[1:01:42] First Kings chapter 12 verse 25 we find
[1:01:45] the situation here rehoboam says I'll
[1:01:48] tax you
[1:01:50] worse than my father
[1:01:52] and jeroboam's anointed of the Lord
[1:01:57] for this moment but then he breaks that
[1:02:01] Judas
[1:02:03] anointed of the Lord
[1:02:05] but when it came time
[1:02:08] he didn't go into the word he denied the
[1:02:11] power of God
[1:02:20] brother Brennan was talking about
[1:02:23] I think it was Saint Augustine of Hippo
[1:02:26] I think it was him
[1:02:27] the Holy Spirit actually came to him
[1:02:30] and he refused it
[1:02:32] and he's the one who went down he went
[1:02:34] to Africa and he wrote in there anyone
[1:02:36] that disagrees made it a statute of
[1:02:38] Catholic religion anyone who disagrees
[1:02:40] with the Roman Church
[1:02:42] can be put to death
[1:02:44] but he was given the opportunity and he
[1:02:46] refused it that's what it is the holy
[1:02:48] spirit comes and they refuse it
[1:02:51] they don't want it
[1:02:53] okay it's not you struggling
[1:02:56] it's not that because you have a desire
[1:02:58] in your heart it's when you refuse the
[1:03:00] word of God but but our focus is the
[1:03:03] idolatry here so First Kings chapter 12
[1:03:06] verse 25.
[1:03:10] so jeroboam takes the children of Israel
[1:03:12] then jeroboam built shechem in Mount
[1:03:15] Ephraim
[1:03:16] and dwelt there and went out from thence
[1:03:18] and bit built panuo
[1:03:21] and jeroboam said in his heart thou now
[1:03:24] now shall the kingdom return to the
[1:03:26] House of David every time man says God's
[1:03:30] not going to be here fast enough God's
[1:03:32] not going to work things out enough I
[1:03:34] gotta do it myself
[1:03:36] they mix that's it and it becomes
[1:03:39] idolatry why did God hate Saul's
[1:03:42] sacrifice it was a sacrifice it was the
[1:03:45] word the word said sacrifice
[1:03:49] but Saul turned it into idolatry because
[1:03:52] it was not his position to do so he said
[1:03:55] Samuel won't be here on time we got to
[1:03:57] go fight
[1:03:58] in other words God's not good enough to
[1:04:00] bring Samuel on time
[1:04:03] when whenever and that's that's man
[1:04:06] lifting himself above God and as soon as
[1:04:09] man lifts himself above God it's
[1:04:12] idolatry as soon as you lift yourself up
[1:04:15] above God and you tell your children
[1:04:17] something
[1:04:19] you make a judgment on them
[1:04:22] you've lifted yourself up you've created
[1:04:24] the turn the message and the word of God
[1:04:26] into idolatry that's right it is God's
[1:04:28] grace and until you're passed away
[1:04:31] there's no judgment
[1:04:33] until you're gone there's no judgment
[1:04:35] first Lord I'm gonna leave it there
[1:04:37] 27 12 27. hey this people go up to do
[1:04:41] sacrifice in the house of the Lord at
[1:04:43] Jerusalem then shall the heart of his P
[1:04:45] this people turn again unto their lord
[1:04:49] even unto reborn king of Judah and they
[1:04:52] shall kill me and go again to rehoboam
[1:04:54] King of Judah God had already told
[1:04:56] jeroboam I've anointed you
[1:04:58] for this purpose
[1:05:03] so why is jeroboam worried about it
[1:05:07] you see you see how close this comes
[1:05:10] down to where we live every single day
[1:05:12] God has given you
[1:05:14] the message God has given you the token
[1:05:18] don't take it into your own hands
[1:05:21] don't try to explain it if you don't
[1:05:23] understand it
[1:05:25] see I don't know
[1:05:26] but I know God is faithful
[1:05:30] whereupon the king took counsel and made
[1:05:33] two calves of gold and said unto them
[1:05:36] it is too much for you to go up to
[1:05:38] Jerusalem Behold thy Gods this was the
[1:05:40] first nicaea Council by the way
[1:05:43] oh Israel which brought the up out of
[1:05:45] the land of Egypt and he set the one in
[1:05:48] Bethel which is in Ephraim
[1:05:51] and the other put he in Dan because Dan
[1:05:53] also
[1:05:54] same law but we're talking about Ephraim
[1:05:56] this morning and this thing became a sin
[1:06:00] for the people went to worship before
[1:06:02] the one even unto Dan and he made in
[1:06:05] House of high places and made priests of
[1:06:07] the lowest of the people which were not
[1:06:10] of the sons of Levi
[1:06:13] he's got priests he's got a house
[1:06:16] he's got it in Bethel
[1:06:18] the house of God
[1:06:23] having the form of godliness
[1:06:26] but denying the power thereof
[1:06:30] this is where we're living today
[1:06:34] God help us
[1:06:36] God help us
[1:06:38] and he made a house of high places and
[1:06:40] made priests
[1:06:41] okay 32 and jeroboam ordained a feast
[1:06:45] on the eighth month on the 15th day of
[1:06:47] the month like unto the feast that is in
[1:06:49] Judah he mirrored the feasts got all the
[1:06:52] same feasts he offered upon the altar
[1:06:54] they got an altar so did he in Bethel
[1:06:57] sacrificing unto the calves that he had
[1:07:00] made and he placed in Bethel priests
[1:07:03] of the high places which he had made so
[1:07:05] he offered upon the altar which he had
[1:07:08] made in Bethel the 15th day of the
[1:07:09] eighth month even in the month which he
[1:07:12] had devised of his own heart and
[1:07:14] ordained a feast unto the children of
[1:07:16] Israel and he offered upon the Altar and
[1:07:18] birth incense
[1:07:20] this
[1:07:23] verse chapter 13. I didn't give this to
[1:07:25] the to the guys
[1:07:27] and behold there came a man of God out
[1:07:30] of Judah with by the word of the Lord
[1:07:31] unto Bethel and jeroboam stood by the
[1:07:34] altar to burn incense
[1:07:37] and he cried against the altar in the
[1:07:38] word of the Lord and said o altar altar
[1:07:40] thus saith Lord behold the child shall
[1:07:42] be born in the House of David Josiah by
[1:07:45] name and upon thee shall he offer the
[1:07:48] priests of the high places that burn
[1:07:49] incense upon thee and the men's bones
[1:07:52] shall be burnt upon thee
[1:07:54] so there's always a butt God's Gonna
[1:07:56] gonna move and God's gonna come but so
[1:07:59] so so
[1:08:01] if jeroboam the king the pastor
[1:08:08] anointed of a spirit
[1:08:12] sets up in Bethel in Ephraim
[1:08:16] idolatry
[1:08:18] but he mirrors it
[1:08:21] to Temple worship
[1:08:23] and he sets it up in the house of God
[1:08:25] Bethel means House of God
[1:08:27] he sets that Idol up directly in the
[1:08:31] house of God
[1:08:33] saints of God this Spirit of idolatry is
[1:08:37] in our house
[1:08:39] it's in our church
[1:08:45] stop calling them churches
[1:08:49] call them lodges do you know why
[1:08:52] do you know why
[1:08:54] and and that angel just hammered him on
[1:08:57] it do you know why he was so strong
[1:08:58] about that so there would be no
[1:09:01] confusion on what church means in the
[1:09:04] Bible
[1:09:06] denominations are not churches
[1:09:10] they are Lodges of belpeor they are
[1:09:13] Lodges of idolatry
[1:09:17] but jeroboam
[1:09:19] a brother a man of the message
[1:09:23] set up idolatry in the house of God
[1:09:27] this is church
[1:09:30] Church all over the world
[1:09:32] message churches that's a church nothing
[1:09:35] outside of that is a church
[1:09:37] it's a lodge and it's so that we don't
[1:09:39] get confused when God talks about church
[1:09:43] and whether Branham talks about church
[1:09:46] he's talking about he might say
[1:09:47] Pentecostals because that was church for
[1:09:50] a while
[1:09:51] but when we talk about Pentecostals you
[1:09:54] you bring that and roll that into
[1:09:56] message
[1:09:56] [Music]
[1:09:58] message because that was the closest
[1:10:00] thing to what he was preaching those are
[1:10:02] his people that's right
[1:10:04] for that that was the season where God
[1:10:06] was
[1:10:07] right but today he's here so when
[1:10:09] brother says you Pentecostals
[1:10:11] he's talking to you message people amen
[1:10:16] amen amen
[1:10:17] [Music]
[1:10:18] um Deuteronomy chapter 29.
[1:10:25] hey you sing that song you clapped that
[1:10:27] song give me the word
[1:10:33] God loves
[1:10:35] loves you I prayed God I want to bring
[1:10:38] this in your Divine love and true
[1:10:40] compassion but when I say compassion was
[1:10:42] when Jesus braided the whip in the
[1:10:44] temple and beat the money changers out
[1:10:46] what did they what had they done they
[1:10:48] had turned changed Temple worship into
[1:10:50] idolatry
[1:10:52] but God in his compassion beat it out of
[1:10:54] the church God and His compassion today
[1:10:57] is coming and he's warning us and he's
[1:10:59] telling us and he's giving us the
[1:11:00] Revelation the ability to see the two
[1:11:02] Spirits operating within the framework
[1:11:05] of the church
[1:11:06] Christianity versus idolatry that is
[1:11:09] what it's going to come down to to the
[1:11:10] very end
[1:11:12] that's right
[1:11:13] Deuteronomy 29 verse 16.
[1:11:17] for you know how how we have dwelt
[1:11:21] uh Deuteronomy 29 verse 16.
[1:11:26] oh you got it right there okay
[1:11:29] I was asked to give the slide guys time
[1:11:31] in our and our interpreter Lord blessed
[1:11:33] brother Alex for his labors
[1:11:36] for you know how we have wealth in the
[1:11:38] land of Egypt and how we came through
[1:11:40] the Nations which he passed by
[1:11:43] and ye have seen their Abominations
[1:11:45] their idols and wood Stones silver and
[1:11:48] goldlets were among them
[1:11:49] so
[1:11:51] he identifies here idols
[1:11:55] as being part of Egypt and those Heathen
[1:11:58] countries in other words part of the
[1:12:01] world
[1:12:02] he says you've seen it you've seen those
[1:12:04] worldly things
[1:12:06] he says Verse 18 lest there should be
[1:12:08] among you man or woman or family or
[1:12:11] tribe whose heart turneth away this day
[1:12:14] from the Lord Our God to go and serve
[1:12:17] the god of gods of these nations lest
[1:12:21] there should be among you a root that
[1:12:24] bears Gall and wormwood
[1:12:27] I believe gold is like a vinegar
[1:12:30] bitter
[1:12:31] bitterness says bitterness will drive
[1:12:33] the Holy Spirit right out of your life
[1:12:35] so it's the root
[1:12:37] God today is not worried about the
[1:12:40] branch the what it looks because guess
[1:12:41] what a branch can be grafted in
[1:12:44] you may not identify the fruit but you
[1:12:46] get down to the root of the problem
[1:12:49] you see what what's what's the problem
[1:12:51] what's going on God wants you get to
[1:12:53] give you the eyes to see the root in his
[1:12:57] word because if you can identify here's
[1:13:01] it here it is if you can identify
[1:13:04] yourself with the root wins May Come
[1:13:07] floods may come hurricanes
[1:13:10] everything tornadoes and your roots will
[1:13:13] stay in the word of God your roots will
[1:13:16] stay
[1:13:18] so he says and it come to pass when he
[1:13:20] heareth the words of this curse that he
[1:13:22] blessed himself in his heart saying I
[1:13:25] shall have peace
[1:13:28] so so even though they hear the word of
[1:13:30] the curse which is going to say they say
[1:13:33] well I I I'm fine I'll have peace though
[1:13:37] I walk in the imagination of my heart to
[1:13:40] add drunkenness to The Thirst the Lord
[1:13:42] will not spare him but then the angler
[1:13:45] of the Lord and his jealousy shall smoke
[1:13:48] against that man and all the curses that
[1:13:51] are written in this book
[1:13:54] shall lie upon him
[1:13:56] and the Lord shall blot out his name
[1:13:59] from under heaven
[1:14:02] that is what God thinks about idolatry
[1:14:06] and this you've been hearing this
[1:14:10] so if this is the word of God does God
[1:14:13] keep his word
[1:14:15] does God make a statement and then
[1:14:18] change his mind
[1:14:20] these are simple things and and that we
[1:14:23] understand
[1:14:24] so therefore if God says your name's
[1:14:27] blotted out
[1:14:28] Brother David covered that so well your
[1:14:30] name's blotted out of the book
[1:14:32] if you fall in idolatry
[1:14:37] and receive seed of that idolatry
[1:14:44] so Ephraim now has fallen in idolatry
[1:14:49] embraced it
[1:14:51] king after King came up some of them
[1:14:54] good
[1:14:55] but not until Josiah came did those high
[1:14:58] places get removed good men came up but
[1:15:01] they were never removed
[1:15:04] for a time for a season in the message
[1:15:08] high places were set up
[1:15:11] by jera Bowens
[1:15:15] bad men rose up good men rose up word
[1:15:19] was preached but it wasn't until Josiah
[1:15:22] the word the Revelation began to open up
[1:15:25] that God began to stir everything up you
[1:15:29] go talk to brother to people like
[1:15:30] brother Ron Peterson who was around in
[1:15:33] those times when men begin to catch
[1:15:34] revelation
[1:15:35] there was arguments and fights and and
[1:15:38] all kinds of chaos happen because people
[1:15:41] are saying you're taking you're going
[1:15:42] outside of the context of the message
[1:15:44] you're you're doing all of this thing
[1:15:46] but it was Revelation it was Josiah
[1:15:49] tearing down those high places
[1:15:52] but now today still that spirit is going
[1:15:55] to is always knocking at the door always
[1:15:59] present with us
[1:16:01] right it's not going to go away until we
[1:16:03] go out of here
[1:16:05] Revelations chapter 7 verse 4.
[1:16:14] if you think
[1:16:16] I'm pointing fingers at a certain
[1:16:18] Message Church
[1:16:20] es certain preachers
[1:16:24] I challenge you to go check your
[1:16:26] experience that's right
[1:16:27] that's right this is just the word of
[1:16:29] God Amen
[1:16:30] amen I can vehemently disagree with
[1:16:32] somebody
[1:16:34] and still call them brother and still
[1:16:36] love them
[1:16:37] because I don't know when God will give
[1:16:39] them a revelation I don't know if they
[1:16:42] aren't seed of God
[1:16:44] so don't ever think when when this is
[1:16:46] being preached through God is using
[1:16:48] brother Chris to preach this that I am
[1:16:50] pointing fingers at somebody
[1:16:52] Revelation chapter 7 verse 4.
[1:16:57] and I heard a number of them which were
[1:16:59] sealed and they were sealed 140 and 4
[1:17:03] 000 of all the tribes of the children of
[1:17:05] Israel
[1:17:06] of the tribe of Judah were sealed to
[1:17:08] twelve thousand so Judah Reuben
[1:17:12] Gad
[1:17:13] Asher
[1:17:16] Nephilim verse 6 Manassas
[1:17:20] of the tribe of Simeon were seal twelve
[1:17:23] thousand verse 7 of the tribe of Levi
[1:17:25] were still twelve thousand is the car
[1:17:27] was still 12 000.
[1:17:30] Zebulon was sealed twelve thousand so
[1:17:33] we're at ten
[1:17:34] Joseph was still the twelve thousand and
[1:17:37] Benjamin
[1:17:39] Ephraim it's not mentioned
[1:17:43] okay
[1:17:46] Hosea 4 17.
[1:17:50] and I just pause to give them a chance
[1:17:55] says Ephraim is joined to Idols let him
[1:17:59] alone
[1:18:04] you can jump to the PowerPoint brothers
[1:18:05] or I'm going to read the seventh this
[1:18:07] quote from the seventh seal I have here
[1:18:10] foreign
[1:18:17] CE from at Bethel and Dan they set up
[1:18:20] idols and these went out to worship this
[1:18:24] and here we are
[1:18:27] plumbed down into the Millennium age
[1:18:29] almost and God still remembers that sin
[1:18:33] they're not even counted in there
[1:18:38] just as sure as he remembers every good
[1:18:40] promise
[1:18:42] he remembers everyone evil too
[1:18:45] that's the reason I believe friends I've
[1:18:47] always tried to stay with that word no
[1:18:49] matter how strange it seems
[1:18:52] for the brand I'm admitting sometimes
[1:18:54] the word of God is strange
[1:18:57] see now they wouldn't think about that
[1:19:00] that sometimes it's strange think about
[1:19:02] that there then they they didn't think
[1:19:05] about it then they thought well they got
[1:19:07] by with it you see what he's saying they
[1:19:10] everyone knew what Deuteronomy said
[1:19:12] most everyone
[1:19:15] hit we're looking at Ephraim
[1:19:18] they fell in idolatry
[1:19:20] but they're going to be bought out from
[1:19:22] under Heaven people who are probably
[1:19:23] waiting watching and nothing happened
[1:19:25] they said well they gotta play with it
[1:19:29] they're still getting away with it today
[1:19:33] but God says
[1:19:35] come the end of time
[1:19:37] they won't be mentioned
[1:19:41] Brother David cover the white Throne
[1:19:42] judgment oh they're getting away with it
[1:19:44] now
[1:19:45] but come that judgment time
[1:19:49] when the books are opened
[1:19:51] but here they are over here okay
[1:19:55] in this Millennium age sitting in
[1:19:58] when when their names and tribes is
[1:20:01] blotted out from it because they served
[1:20:03] idolatry that God cursed
[1:20:06] didn't he say he hated the Nicolaitans
[1:20:10] and that Jezebel
[1:20:13] well
[1:20:14] Jezebel was
[1:20:17] a follower of Baal
[1:20:19] she was a
[1:20:21] very involved in it she brought it with
[1:20:23] Ahab and Ahab married her
[1:20:25] you see Ahab if you go watch and I'm
[1:20:27] gonna just gonna take the Liberty to say
[1:20:29] this my own personal opinion so you know
[1:20:31] Ahab tried many times God come forward
[1:20:35] come to Ahab and Ahab will repent
[1:20:39] I believe they have when he had he
[1:20:40] married a good woman
[1:20:43] would have had a different story
[1:20:45] but she brought him down
[1:20:48] to hell
[1:20:51] the bride we hey man we have to be
[1:20:54] married to the right thing
[1:20:57] married to God's word
[1:21:00] to bring us up
[1:21:02] into Heavenly places
[1:21:06] stay away from it didn't he say he would
[1:21:08] kill Jezebel's daughters with the
[1:21:10] killing of death which is eternal
[1:21:12] separations from his presence
[1:21:15] don't trust in it at all get away from
[1:21:17] it so God remembers
[1:21:20] God never forgets
[1:21:22] his word
[1:21:25] one one in in in in as a Jew as in the
[1:21:28] Bible
[1:21:30] the worst thing
[1:21:32] is that is a is a dog that's the lowest
[1:21:36] is a dog
[1:21:37] and that's who
[1:21:40] cleans up Jezebel
[1:21:42] that's right that's who licks up ahab's
[1:21:44] blood God using every opportunity to
[1:21:47] show us how much he hates idolatry
[1:21:50] that's right how much he cannot stand
[1:21:53] that spirit
[1:21:55] that wants to come in and say oh yeah we
[1:21:58] can have the same Feasts
[1:22:00] we can have the same
[1:22:03] traditions
[1:22:05] we can look and have and act like a
[1:22:07] message church and
[1:22:09] but there's this portion of the word
[1:22:10] that
[1:22:11] disqualifies me or is it a portion of
[1:22:13] the word that we're not sure we're going
[1:22:17] to leave out
[1:22:19] right there
[1:22:21] you might as well go worship at the
[1:22:23] Buddhist temple
[1:22:24] because God is not in it amen
[1:22:28] and God hates it so much
[1:22:31] because he created you why does he hate
[1:22:34] it so much because he created you to be
[1:22:37] a part of him and he can't do that if
[1:22:41] you have fallen fornication to belpure
[1:22:45] and that desire is burned from your
[1:22:47] heart because you've crossed the line
[1:22:49] that's right
[1:22:51] but God's people their names are
[1:22:53] reserved somewhere
[1:23:00] don't identify yourself
[1:23:03] with those who fell at LPR
[1:23:06] just make sure your life is good just
[1:23:09] make sure your your your your your your
[1:23:12] marriage with Christ
[1:23:14] is the way it should be your
[1:23:16] relationship is strong
[1:23:19] spend time with him
[1:23:21] however after this period of tribulation
[1:23:23] during the Millennium as seen by Ezekiel
[1:23:26] in 48 1-8
[1:23:28] and 22-29 we see the tribes back once
[1:23:32] more in divine order but from the time
[1:23:35] that Ephraim and Dan joined themselves
[1:23:37] to Idols they died what is death in the
[1:23:41] Bible Eternal separation
[1:23:43] and those and those tribes have no more
[1:23:46] recognition
[1:23:48] now I realize that since the destruction
[1:23:49] of Jerusalem all records of all tribes
[1:23:52] have been lost so that no one can say
[1:23:54] for sure what tribe he is from but God
[1:23:58] knows
[1:23:59] that great God who is bringing Israel
[1:24:01] back to Palestine knows exactly which
[1:24:03] tribe every true Israelite is from and
[1:24:07] from all the assembled 144
[1:24:10] 000 Dan and Ephraim will be missing amen
[1:24:16] foreign
[1:24:19] that is not to say some
[1:24:22] child of Ephraim in modern days can't
[1:24:26] find Christ and become a part of the
[1:24:28] bride of Christ
[1:24:31] they're just not part of this the tribe
[1:24:33] it's not part of this
[1:24:37] Hosea 5 verse 3.
[1:24:41] I have all these these here just in my
[1:24:43] notes
[1:24:44] I I like I said I tried to leave out as
[1:24:47] much as I could
[1:24:52] it says I know Ephraim and Israel
[1:24:56] is so he says okay excuse me I know
[1:24:58] Ephraim and Israel is not hid from me
[1:25:02] from now o Ephraim thou committest
[1:25:04] hoardom and Israel is defiled
[1:25:08] Hosea 5 verse 5.
[1:25:12] and the pride of Israel testify to his
[1:25:15] face
[1:25:17] therefore shall Israel and Ephraim fall
[1:25:19] in their iniquity Judah also shall fall
[1:25:22] with them the pride of Israel
[1:25:25] Christ testifying to their face
[1:25:29] but they fall in their iniquity
[1:25:33] Hosea 5 11 to 14. Ephraim is oppressed
[1:25:37] and broken in judgment
[1:25:40] because he willingly walked after the
[1:25:43] Commandment he willingly walked in
[1:25:46] idolatry he willingly walked away from
[1:25:50] the word
[1:25:55] therefore will I be unto Ephraim as a
[1:25:58] moth into the house of Judah as
[1:26:01] rottenness
[1:26:02] when Ephraim saw his sickness and Judah
[1:26:05] saw his wound they went to Ephraim to
[1:26:08] the Assyrian and sent to the king jereb
[1:26:11] yet could he not heal you nor cure you
[1:26:15] of your wound they didn't even go to God
[1:26:18] they went to the Assyrians more
[1:26:20] idolaters
[1:26:24] for I will be unto Ephraim as a lion and
[1:26:27] as a Young Lion to the house of Judah I
[1:26:30] even I will tear and go away I will take
[1:26:33] away and None Shall rescue him
[1:26:36] this is how God looks at idolatry
[1:26:41] the whole book of Hosea I pray pretty
[1:26:43] much we're pretty much reading the whole
[1:26:44] book so go back and
[1:26:46] maybe with now with with this in your
[1:26:49] heart you'll better understand this book
[1:26:50] of Prophecy amen because it is a book
[1:26:56] I think it's this is the book of uh well
[1:26:59] anyways so Hosea 6 verse 4.
[1:27:04] oh Ephraim what shall I do unto thee o
[1:27:07] Judah what shall I do unto thee
[1:27:10] for your goodness is as a morning cloud
[1:27:12] and as the early do it goeth away
[1:27:16] no goodness is found in you Ephraim what
[1:27:18] am I going to do with you
[1:27:21] a morning Cloud as the sun comes up it
[1:27:23] just vanishes
[1:27:25] what am I going to do with you you've
[1:27:27] fallen in idolatry you've forsaken me
[1:27:31] what am I going to do with you
[1:27:34] therefore have I hewed them by the
[1:27:36] prophets I have slain them by the words
[1:27:39] of my mouth and thy judgments are as the
[1:27:41] light that goeth forth
[1:27:44] for I desired Mercy
[1:27:46] and not sacrifice
[1:27:49] and the knowledge of God more than burnt
[1:27:52] offerings revelation of Christ more than
[1:27:56] your burnt offerings oh brother I've
[1:27:59] been on the mission field month after
[1:28:01] month where are your children
[1:28:05] where's your relationship as a minister
[1:28:07] I get and I study and I preach but I
[1:28:09] still have to keep myself
[1:28:11] in devotion in serving God
[1:28:14] this is just a channel that God uses but
[1:28:17] if I don't keep myself in the devotions
[1:28:19] for my personal life you see me get up
[1:28:22] here and preach and you have zero
[1:28:24] confidence because my family is falling
[1:28:25] apart
[1:28:32] knowledge of God more than burnt
[1:28:34] offerings
[1:28:35] foreign
[1:28:37] but they like men have transgressed the
[1:28:41] Covenant
[1:28:46] God has put so much into a covenant
[1:28:50] he made a covenant with Noah he made a
[1:28:54] covenant with Adam and Eve when they he
[1:28:56] dressed them in bloody skins
[1:28:59] he made a covenant with Noah
[1:29:02] he made a covenant with Abraham
[1:29:06] God's covenant but you they transgressed
[1:29:09] the covenants they're there have they
[1:29:11] dealt treacherously against me
[1:29:16] while we were yet sinners Christ died
[1:29:18] for us how could we not put our heart
[1:29:21] into serving him amen how could we allow
[1:29:24] idolatry to come in to where we look at
[1:29:28] the word if we look at the Bible as just
[1:29:29] the book
[1:29:31] and we turn it into rules and
[1:29:32] regulations for our kids
[1:29:34] we turn into rules and regulations for
[1:29:37] ourselves and we'll go to church when we
[1:29:39] feel like it
[1:29:40] yeah while you were Sinners God died for
[1:29:43] you he wants relationship not idolatry
[1:29:47] he doesn't want your burnt offerings he
[1:29:50] wants you to have a revelation and he
[1:29:53] wants you to serve him and he wants you
[1:29:54] to follow his word amen Saul said oh we
[1:29:58] saved The Oxen from the enemy for burnt
[1:30:01] offerings
[1:30:02] Samuel said that's not what God wants he
[1:30:04] wants obedience to his word
[1:30:09] we're no longer in a season of playing
[1:30:11] around
[1:30:13] we are face to face with our enemy
[1:30:17] if you're face to face with your enemy
[1:30:18] and you look away one second what's he
[1:30:20] gonna do he's gonna strike you amen
[1:30:23] that's why you have to be you want to
[1:30:25] stay fake face to face with the Enemy
[1:30:27] you take care of your devotions
[1:30:30] I preach I preach this
[1:30:33] at Thursday night in Portland and I
[1:30:34] preached Sunday night and
[1:30:36] brother Jones
[1:30:38] a sermon called brother dig another
[1:30:39] ditch
[1:30:41] talking about the story of the make the
[1:30:44] valley full of ditches
[1:30:46] you have to constantly be digging
[1:30:48] ditches to prepare the way for the water
[1:30:50] of the word to wash your life because
[1:30:53] when the wind blows the ditches fill up
[1:30:55] and you have to go dig them again
[1:30:58] you have to keep on digging up that
[1:31:00] route that Spirit of idology that wants
[1:31:03] to come in your house that wants to come
[1:31:04] into your life
[1:31:08] go into your your your kids rooms
[1:31:10] surprise them
[1:31:12] that's right
[1:31:13] surprise and let me look at your phone
[1:31:17] know what they're wearing look let me
[1:31:19] see your outfit okay now
[1:31:22] or okay that looks good be the holy
[1:31:24] spirit amen and then when they're not
[1:31:27] with you you say God I can't be there
[1:31:30] but be there with them
[1:31:33] give them the strength because they're
[1:31:35] fighting battles just like you and I
[1:31:38] give them the strength do not put the
[1:31:41] pants on again at school
[1:31:43] God give them the strength when they're
[1:31:44] alone to not look at the pornography
[1:31:46] give them the strength and they're alone
[1:31:48] to not pick up the the cigarette from
[1:31:50] the body or the vapor The Vape the
[1:31:53] e-cigarette
[1:31:55] because it tastes good right the devil
[1:31:58] is just so brought it down to anybody
[1:32:00] can just pick up and vape it there's no
[1:32:02] learning curve
[1:32:03] and they're addicted to nicotine because
[1:32:06] it's sweet it's flavored blueberry what
[1:32:08] do you want watermelon
[1:32:11] that's where the devil has fine-tuned it
[1:32:13] but so has God because when the enemy
[1:32:16] comes in like a flood God raises up a
[1:32:19] standard are you one of them
[1:32:22] yeah
[1:32:24] Gilead is a city of them that work
[1:32:26] iniquity and is polluted with blood
[1:32:30] Gilead right in Ephraim I believe so the
[1:32:34] mount
[1:32:37] what was the what was that religion
[1:32:39] sacrificing of their children
[1:32:42] innocent blood of kids
[1:32:45] and as troops of robbers wait for a man
[1:32:47] so the company of priests murder in the
[1:32:50] way by consent for they commit lewdness
[1:32:54] immorality
[1:32:56] fornication lewdness that's what that is
[1:33:01] what is this
[1:33:02] this is this he's talking about iframe
[1:33:04] but this is the same thing as belpure
[1:33:07] that same spirit
[1:33:10] it was sex at the beginning
[1:33:12] it's going to be sex at the end that is
[1:33:16] why it's in your face
[1:33:18] and that is why we as men and God have
[1:33:20] to just start saying it across the
[1:33:22] pulpit
[1:33:23] man you go on a store you say God guard
[1:33:26] my eyes because guess what you're going
[1:33:27] to see what 20 30 30 50 years ago I
[1:33:31] don't know how long you had to go find
[1:33:33] somewhere
[1:33:35] now they're it's right there in the
[1:33:37] magazines and they're wearing it in
[1:33:39] public
[1:33:41] that's right
[1:33:45] I have seen a horrible thing in the
[1:33:47] house of Israel there is whoredom in
[1:33:50] Ephraim Israel is defiled what is Israel
[1:33:54] the church
[1:33:56] the church is defiled
[1:34:01] how do we keep that Spirit bring this
[1:34:04] right down home today how do we keep
[1:34:05] that Spirit out of Grace Tabernacle
[1:34:10] amen each one of you keeps that Spirit
[1:34:13] out of your life and out of your home
[1:34:18] okay that spirit's not in your home your
[1:34:21] kids have to go outside of your home
[1:34:23] somewhere else to fight it
[1:34:27] exactly right and that's a lot harder to
[1:34:29] do when you say nine o'clock is your
[1:34:31] curfew
[1:34:33] you got someone you got a kid who's and
[1:34:35] I I don't have teenagers yet
[1:34:37] but I remember being a teenager
[1:34:41] if you got a kid who's not
[1:34:44] doing well
[1:34:45] then make their curfew 6 pm
[1:34:50] now if they break that well you
[1:34:53] you can punish them
[1:34:56] discipline them but
[1:34:59] sometimes we have to
[1:35:00] get serious all I'm trying to say I'm
[1:35:02] trying to tell you how to parent
[1:35:04] I'm trying to tell you got to get
[1:35:06] serious about this stuff
[1:35:10] the spirit I was talking with the
[1:35:11] brother who's a who's an FBI agent
[1:35:14] and uh very well aware of the sex
[1:35:17] trafficking in the world today
[1:35:20] and uh just different things and online
[1:35:23] and
[1:35:24] and
[1:35:25] um we were talking and it's the elephant
[1:35:27] in the room nobody wants to talk about
[1:35:30] but it's
[1:35:32] lewdness
[1:35:34] is the is the byproduct of that Spirit
[1:35:37] of idolatry
[1:35:38] well we'll talk about the spirit of
[1:35:40] idolatry
[1:35:43] in the church and you know the doctrines
[1:35:46] and but it's immorality
[1:35:50] is the cause of that amen
[1:35:55] parents have that discussion with your
[1:35:57] kids
[1:35:58] at age appropriate of course
[1:36:00] but start when they're young
[1:36:02] you can say it a different way
[1:36:06] well why Dad well I'll tell you when
[1:36:07] you're overall you always say that
[1:36:14] Hosea 7 verse 1.
[1:36:20] when I would have healed Israel
[1:36:23] then the iniquity of Ephraim was
[1:36:25] discovered
[1:36:26] and the wickedness wickedness of Samaria
[1:36:31] brother I'm standing on the platform
[1:36:33] he says step right this way brother
[1:36:37] I see you I see okay you're from
[1:36:41] Illinois
[1:36:43] you live on
[1:36:44] 4250 Baker Street oh
[1:36:47] you want to be healed of cancer
[1:36:50] will you give up those cigarettes
[1:36:54] and serve God
[1:37:01] I would have hit Israel
[1:37:03] but the iniquity of Ephraim was
[1:37:05] discovered
[1:37:07] God comes to heal
[1:37:09] then he discovers the sin in your life
[1:37:12] he discovers that in your life now
[1:37:14] Ephraim
[1:37:15] that they were over with
[1:37:18] they're off the book you're still there
[1:37:24] the words comes I the Lord desires to
[1:37:27] heal you will you take care of that
[1:37:30] thing in your life
[1:37:31] will you go do that and take care of
[1:37:34] that thing in your life you don't have
[1:37:35] to be like Ephraim
[1:37:37] we're gonna get there
[1:37:40] the wickedness of Samaria for they
[1:37:42] commit falsehood and the thief thief
[1:37:45] cometh in and the troop of robbers
[1:37:47] spoileth without
[1:37:50] verse 10.
[1:37:51] and the pride of Israel testify oh I
[1:37:54] have that one in there twice
[1:37:57] to his face oh excuse me it's not in
[1:37:59] there twice and the pride of Israel
[1:38:00] testifies to his face and they they do
[1:38:04] not return to the Lord their God nor
[1:38:06] seek him for all of this the pride of
[1:38:09] Israel Christ directly to their face
[1:38:14] and they still don't return to the Lord
[1:38:17] the word spoken and they turn it down
[1:38:19] that's the that's the dividing line you
[1:38:22] say oh no I've sinned and I've done all
[1:38:24] of this no no
[1:38:26] use of a desire to do what God wants you
[1:38:28] to do you are not here for him
[1:38:32] but this is a this is an admonishment
[1:38:34] this morning of what that Spirit of
[1:38:36] idolatry can do to your life can do to
[1:38:39] your family can do to our church
[1:38:42] we go here this is where we live
[1:38:47] chapter 8 verse 9.
[1:38:52] for they are gone
[1:38:57] for they are gone up to Assyria
[1:38:59] a wild ass Alone by himself Ephraim hath
[1:39:03] hired lovers
[1:39:05] oh we we can't find love in the end God
[1:39:09] so we're going to go hire it out
[1:39:12] we're going to go hire some prostitutes
[1:39:19] 8 11 because Ephraim hath made many
[1:39:23] altars to sin altar shall be unto him to
[1:39:28] sin
[1:39:31] 9 verse 1.
[1:39:35] Rejoice not o Israel for joy as other
[1:39:38] people for thou has gone a whoring from
[1:39:41] thy God thou Hast loved a reward upon
[1:39:44] every corn floor the floor and the wine
[1:39:47] press shall not feed them and the new
[1:39:50] wine shall fail in her
[1:39:55] God's seed will never anchor in a womb
[1:39:58] that has the seed of idolatry
[1:40:01] the new wine the Holy Spirit brother God
[1:40:03] says that's why brother I said you can't
[1:40:05] put new wine in an old bottle
[1:40:09] you got to be changed first
[1:40:12] don't let that new wine fail within you
[1:40:16] don't let that happen say God change me
[1:40:24] they shall not dwell verse 3 in the
[1:40:27] Lord's land but Ephraim shall return to
[1:40:30] Egypt
[1:40:31] yeah that's it and you'll eat the
[1:40:33] unclean things in Assyria the
[1:40:36] manifestation of that spirit is a return
[1:40:38] to the world
[1:40:41] like a dog back to its vomit
[1:40:45] that Spirit manifests and brings them in
[1:40:49] that individual back to the world maybe
[1:40:51] they're still in the they're still in
[1:40:52] church
[1:40:54] but they're looking like the world more
[1:40:56] and more every day why is worldliness
[1:40:58] such a problem I don't know how much of
[1:41:01] you travel around
[1:41:04] but you travel around and you see it and
[1:41:07] you wonder what are we missing
[1:41:10] why are you dressing like that don't you
[1:41:12] have a clue
[1:41:14] I think part of it is parents not being
[1:41:19] open about it
[1:41:21] dodging around it the elephant in the
[1:41:23] room no tell your girl you dress like
[1:41:25] that man looks after you and wants to
[1:41:27] have sex with you
[1:41:29] that's how we have to that's the devil's
[1:41:32] doing it
[1:41:34] he's speaking it like that
[1:41:36] so we're gonna hide and no oh
[1:41:39] you know we got the profit and it's holy
[1:41:43] no it's messy
[1:41:47] I heard a song I think about it was not
[1:41:50] a silent night
[1:41:52] when Jesus was born
[1:41:54] Mary screaming what trying to find a
[1:41:56] place and I thought you know they kind
[1:41:57] of have a point there I understand the
[1:41:59] Silent Night part was peace and and
[1:42:01] everything that came but there was a
[1:42:03] time there was a bit of a chaos
[1:42:06] you know don't get the hay on the new
[1:42:08] baby don't get the poop on the new baby
[1:42:10] pick up Joseph pick it up quick pick it
[1:42:12] up
[1:42:13] it's a mess
[1:42:15] sometimes we have to get in and roll up
[1:42:18] our sleeves
[1:42:19] and just say this is this is just what
[1:42:21] we're going to have to do we're going to
[1:42:22] have to have this conversation
[1:42:25] and you know what parents as a youth
[1:42:26] leader I can tell you this your parent
[1:42:27] your kids know more than you think they
[1:42:29] do about the world
[1:42:32] because today it's everywhere right on
[1:42:34] down to
[1:42:35] NASA's and Elena's age they know
[1:42:39] stuff that you would be surprised they
[1:42:41] know even in a message home
[1:42:45] because that's the devil
[1:42:48] he's anointed it at a younger age
[1:42:50] because God
[1:42:52] has the 11th Hour worker
[1:42:56] it's the devil's coming for them
[1:42:58] 9 verse 10.
[1:43:01] I found Israel like grapes in the
[1:43:03] wilderness I saw your fathers as the
[1:43:05] first stripe in the Fig Tree at her
[1:43:07] first time but they went to Bell peor at
[1:43:10] one time
[1:43:13] part of the of the anointing at one time
[1:43:16] a part of the word Judas at one time
[1:43:19] ifram at one time
[1:43:22] but then he said I gotta handle this
[1:43:24] myself
[1:43:25] and set up an idol right in the house of
[1:43:27] God
[1:43:28] but they went to belpure and separated
[1:43:30] themselves into unto that shame
[1:43:34] and their Abominations were according as
[1:43:37] they loved as for Ephraim their Glory
[1:43:40] shall Fly Away
[1:43:42] like a bird from the birth and from the
[1:43:45] womb and from the conception
[1:43:47] though they bring up their children yet
[1:43:49] will I bereave them that there shall not
[1:43:51] be a man left yea woe also to them when
[1:43:54] I depart from them no seed raised up
[1:43:57] Ephraim as I saw Tyrus is planted in a
[1:44:00] pleasant place
[1:44:03] but Ephraim shall bring forth his
[1:44:04] children to the murderer
[1:44:06] give them O Lord What wilt thou give
[1:44:08] them a miscarrying womb and a dry
[1:44:12] breasts no life
[1:44:16] dead
[1:44:17] Eternal separation
[1:44:22] Eternal separation
[1:44:26] all their wickedness is in gilgal for
[1:44:29] there I hated them for their wickedness
[1:44:31] of their doings I will drive them out of
[1:44:33] my house I will love them no more all
[1:44:35] their princes all revolters Ephraim is
[1:44:37] smitten their root is dried up they
[1:44:40] shall bear no fruit
[1:44:42] yea though they bring forth yet will I
[1:44:45] slay even the Beloved fruit of their
[1:44:47] womb my God will cast them away because
[1:44:50] they did not hearken unto him and they
[1:44:53] shall be Wanderers
[1:44:55] among the Nations
[1:44:59] couple more Hosea 12 verse 1.
[1:45:03] Ephraim feateth on wind
[1:45:06] the eating the thin air
[1:45:09] nothing no meat to their words nothing
[1:45:12] to their actions oh they can sound right
[1:45:15] but there's nothing packed backing them
[1:45:18] up
[1:45:19] and follow us after the East Wind he did
[1:45:22] he delay
[1:45:24] increased lies he daily excuse me
[1:45:27] increases lies and desolation and they
[1:45:29] do make a covenant with the Assyrians
[1:45:32] and oil is carried into Egypt
[1:45:36] Ephraim was the had the oil
[1:45:38] their oil is carried away into Egypt the
[1:45:42] world swallowed the flame
[1:45:45] no oil no fire
[1:45:48] don't let the world swallow your oil
[1:45:52] you keep that flame burning bright you
[1:45:54] got to keep adding that oil
[1:45:56] pouring in that oil from the word
[1:46:00] 13 Verse 1 when they're from spank
[1:46:02] trembling
[1:46:04] he exalted himself in Israel
[1:46:07] but when he offended in Baal he died
[1:46:12] that's it right there
[1:46:14] if from spake trembling it was
[1:46:16] humbleness in God and he exalted in
[1:46:18] Israel
[1:46:19] but then he fell in Bell and he died
[1:46:23] God took took them away
[1:46:31] you say wow brother Chris
[1:46:33] what a hopeless picture
[1:46:39] saying
[1:46:40] I was studying just yesterday and I
[1:46:42] mentioned the December 17th but
[1:46:46] I began to read in Ezra chapter 9 and
[1:46:49] 10.
[1:46:51] and a lot of times I'll listen to like
[1:46:52] soft music instrumental music while I
[1:46:55] study helps block the noise of the kids
[1:46:57] out too
[1:47:01] and this picture has been painted for me
[1:47:04] already
[1:47:05] of Ephraim and idolatry
[1:47:09] I thought oh God what what are we doing
[1:47:11] in our lives
[1:47:12] how are our lives
[1:47:15] because I'm not gonna my name's not
[1:47:17] gonna be blotted off the book
[1:47:18] but God what am I doing to cause
[1:47:21] what am I doing that's idolatry
[1:47:25] and then begin to read in Ezra chapter 9
[1:47:27] and 10.
[1:47:29] and as I'm reading it
[1:47:31] that song begins to play in my ear
[1:47:35] oh man
[1:47:38] Zing Grace
[1:47:41] how sweet
[1:47:43] no sound
[1:47:46] and I thought oh God
[1:47:51] that's it
[1:47:53] that's it
[1:47:55] say well what's Ezra 9 we're going to
[1:47:57] read it
[1:47:57] but first we have Hosea 13. verse 9. o
[1:48:02] Israel thou Hast destroyed thyself but
[1:48:04] in me is thine help
[1:48:07] I will be thy King when there
[1:48:10] is any other that my safety in all thy
[1:48:13] cities
[1:48:14] and the judges of whom thou said is give
[1:48:16] me a king and princes
[1:48:18] I gave thee a king and my anger Saul
[1:48:22] and took him away in my wrath
[1:48:24] the iniquity of Ephraim has bound up his
[1:48:26] sin is hid
[1:48:27] the Sorrows of a travailing woman shall
[1:48:30] come upon him he is an unwise son for he
[1:48:32] shall not stay long in the place of the
[1:48:34] breaking forth of children
[1:48:37] I will Ransom them from the power of the
[1:48:40] grave
[1:48:42] I will redeem them from death
[1:48:45] o death I will be thy plagues oh great
[1:48:50] Obe thy destruction
[1:48:53] repentance shall be hid for mine eyes
[1:48:59] I will Ransom you
[1:49:02] bride I will Ransom you from the power
[1:49:06] of death
[1:49:07] I will bring plagues upon death I will
[1:49:10] bring destruction on the grave I'll
[1:49:13] Ransom you
[1:49:17] amen oh Israel Hosea 14 1 oh Israel
[1:49:19] return unto the Lord thy God for thou
[1:49:22] has fallen by thine iniquity
[1:49:26] God calling out to Israel to his bride
[1:49:28] his church his love
[1:49:31] 14 4 I will heal their backsliding
[1:49:35] I will love them freely in other words
[1:49:38] I'm not going to love them reservedly
[1:49:41] because they backslid no I'm gonna pull
[1:49:43] them I'm gonna rescue them from their
[1:49:45] backsliding and I'm gonna love them
[1:49:47] freely
[1:49:48] I'm not gonna hold anything against them
[1:49:51] I will love them freely
[1:49:54] for my anger is turned away from him
[1:49:59] Ephraim and that is for an example of
[1:50:03] how God looks at idolatry
[1:50:05] and what's going to happen at the
[1:50:07] Judgment but you have a chance today
[1:50:11] amen for God is ready to heal your
[1:50:13] backslide to love you freely
[1:50:17] his anger is already turned from you
[1:50:21] and he is here calling you
[1:50:27] I was pondering why this is being
[1:50:29] preached so much
[1:50:31] and I thought of that quote
[1:50:34] this is from The Tote The Rapture
[1:50:42] and as soon as it went out
[1:50:45] can you mute me real quick I got a
[1:50:57] as soon as it went out every time one of
[1:51:01] them would come they'd go out to a
[1:51:02] certain place then drop off
[1:51:04] I just hear the sound of it as it went
[1:51:06] away
[1:51:07] this is the preview of the Bride the
[1:51:09] vision then I heard something like
[1:51:11] Onward Christian Soldiers I looked and
[1:51:14] here come that sainted bunch of little
[1:51:16] girls just exactly the way they was all
[1:51:19] correctly dressed
[1:51:21] their hair hanging way down their backs
[1:51:23] smooth clean marching like this to the
[1:51:26] step of the Gospel
[1:51:28] not the song The Gospel
[1:51:31] she was the word
[1:51:33] they look like one of out of every
[1:51:36] nation you say what were the word
[1:51:37] brother Chris we don't need this kind of
[1:51:39] preaching today
[1:51:40] finish the quote
[1:51:44] they look like one out of every nation I
[1:51:46] was looking at it as they passed by and
[1:51:48] seen them pass by instead of going down
[1:51:50] they started going up
[1:51:52] I noticed one of them trying two or
[1:51:55] three of them trying getting out of the
[1:51:57] line that's right I screamed stay in
[1:52:00] line and the vision left me and I was
[1:52:02] standing in the room screaming stay in
[1:52:05] line
[1:52:06] Wonder Could it already be Pat could it
[1:52:08] be already passed could the bride
[1:52:10] already be called is that what we're
[1:52:12] going through today she has to be molded
[1:52:15] and made into the image of Christ and
[1:52:18] Christ is the word
[1:52:20] that's the only things that see it's in
[1:52:24] there in the word
[1:52:26] there cannot be one thing added
[1:52:30] can't be a woman with one hand like a
[1:52:33] man and the other hand with a paw like a
[1:52:35] dog it's got to be exactly the word of
[1:52:38] the Lord yes it matters yes it down to
[1:52:43] the finest detail it matters
[1:52:46] don't let it sit there in your life even
[1:52:48] if it's just mostly okay
[1:52:51] don't stay there in your position if
[1:52:54] it's the minister just mostly okay you
[1:52:57] need the full word of God being
[1:52:59] ministered to your soul
[1:53:03] the Bride is a part of the bridegroom
[1:53:05] the woman is a part of her husband
[1:53:06] because she's taken out of the husband
[1:53:09] Eve was a part of Adam from his side and
[1:53:12] so is the bride not taken from a
[1:53:14] denomination but taken from the bosom of
[1:53:17] the word of God for this day
[1:53:23] amen all right
[1:53:25] I'm closing soon Ezra chapter 9 verse 1.
[1:53:32] if you know the story of Ezra
[1:53:34] the King of Persia allows many of the
[1:53:38] refugees of many of those that were were
[1:53:41] take the captives
[1:53:43] go back
[1:53:45] Nehemiah helped with the building of the
[1:53:47] wall and everything but Ezra was the one
[1:53:49] who helped with the re-establishment of
[1:53:52] Temple worship
[1:53:54] so Ezra's back here
[1:53:58] in Jerusalem
[1:54:00] nine verse 1. now when these things were
[1:54:03] done the princes came to me saying the
[1:54:06] people of Israel and the priests and the
[1:54:08] Levites have not separated themselves
[1:54:10] from the people of the lands
[1:54:12] doing according to their Abominations
[1:54:14] even of the canines the Hittites the
[1:54:16] parasites the jebusites the ammonites
[1:54:19] the moabites the Egyptians and the
[1:54:22] amorites
[1:54:23] for they have taken of their daughters
[1:54:26] for themselves and for their sons amen
[1:54:30] delpio
[1:54:33] but watch this story is a little bit
[1:54:35] different
[1:54:37] so that the holy seed have mingled
[1:54:39] themselves with the people of those
[1:54:41] lands
[1:54:42] yea the hand of the princes and rulers
[1:54:45] have been Chief in this trespass
[1:54:49] the leaders
[1:54:52] verse 5 I tried to cut it up not to
[1:54:54] spend too much time
[1:54:56] and at the evening sacrifice so he's
[1:54:59] smitten in his heart he hears this news
[1:55:01] and he's spitting in his heart
[1:55:03] at the evening sacrifice I arose up from
[1:55:06] my heaviness
[1:55:07] having rent my garment and my mantle I
[1:55:10] fell upon my knees and spread out my
[1:55:13] hands unto the Lord my God
[1:55:16] and said oh my God I am ashamed and
[1:55:19] blessed blush to lift up my face to thee
[1:55:23] my God
[1:55:25] for our iniquities are increased over
[1:55:28] our head in our trespass is grown up
[1:55:31] unto the heavens
[1:55:34] I'm ashamed Lord to even tell you to
[1:55:37] even come
[1:55:41] chapter 9 verse 15.
[1:55:46] he lays out the situation in prayer and
[1:55:48] he says oh Lord God of Israel Thou Art
[1:55:50] righteous
[1:55:52] for we remain yet escaped
[1:55:55] as it is this day behold we are before
[1:55:57] thee in our trespasses
[1:56:00] for we cannot stand before thee because
[1:56:03] of this
[1:56:05] in in this if we'll read it I don't know
[1:56:08] but he says the King of Persia has given
[1:56:11] us this opportunity
[1:56:13] help us to seize it Lord
[1:56:16] help us to take this chance this morning
[1:56:18] God has given an opportunity
[1:56:21] for me
[1:56:22] for you
[1:56:24] help us to seize this chance
[1:56:27] for we cannot stand before thee because
[1:56:29] of this in other words the King of
[1:56:31] Persia he's given us this opportunity
[1:56:34] but it'll never work if we cannot deal
[1:56:36] with this trespass
[1:56:38] God don't let it come to not
[1:56:42] chapter 10 verse 1.
[1:56:46] now when Ezra had prayed and when he had
[1:56:49] confessed weeping and casting himself
[1:56:52] down before the house of God they're
[1:56:54] assembled unto him out of Israel a very
[1:56:56] great Congregation of men women and
[1:56:59] children for the people wept very sore
[1:57:04] struck in their hearts realized what
[1:57:07] they had done wrong
[1:57:08] and they come
[1:57:11] and Shekinah the son of jahil one of the
[1:57:14] sons of ilam answered and said unto Ezra
[1:57:17] I can imagine his face
[1:57:20] is red his eyes puffy
[1:57:22] his voice broken
[1:57:25] we have trespassed against our God and
[1:57:28] have taken strange wives of the people
[1:57:30] of the land yet now there is hope in
[1:57:32] Israel concerning this thing
[1:57:37] there was nothing these women
[1:57:39] we're normal women
[1:57:41] except that they belonged to Moab
[1:57:45] but if you met them you might have been
[1:57:47] nice people
[1:57:50] but God had a word that he wanted them
[1:57:52] to keep
[1:57:55] now therefore let us make a covenant
[1:57:57] with our God
[1:58:00] to put away all the wives
[1:58:05] such as our born of them
[1:58:07] and such as our born of them according
[1:58:09] to the counsel of my Lord
[1:58:11] and of those that tremble at the
[1:58:13] Commandment of our God and let it be
[1:58:15] done according to the law
[1:58:17] here you have a people
[1:58:19] Married With Children
[1:58:21] and so we're ready to keep the word of
[1:58:23] God
[1:58:24] this is a spiritual application today
[1:58:28] not literal
[1:58:30] we're ready to keep the word of God
[1:58:32] broken in their hearts because they're
[1:58:33] going to have to send their families
[1:58:35] away
[1:58:37] but let it be done according to your
[1:58:39] they knew Bel peor they knew what
[1:58:41] happened
[1:58:43] they said now's our chance to restore
[1:58:45] Israel if this trespass can be taken
[1:58:48] care of
[1:58:50] chapter 10 verse 44.
[1:58:58] so they go
[1:59:01] and they send these they count I said we
[1:59:03] need time to do this
[1:59:06] it's going to take time for those many
[1:59:08] such who have wiseling children like
[1:59:10] this
[1:59:12] I think it was about a month or so it
[1:59:13] took them to figure this all out
[1:59:16] but it ends it lists these leaders verse
[1:59:20] 44 all these had taken strained wives
[1:59:22] and some of them had wives by whom they
[1:59:25] had children
[1:59:28] this was not an easy thing to do
[1:59:34] but God forgave them
[1:59:38] they put away this was God gave them a
[1:59:42] chance
[1:59:44] the word was brought forth and God gave
[1:59:46] them a chance but brother Branham came
[1:59:48] and he preached marriage and divorced
[1:59:49] God gave them all those people present
[1:59:53] a chance that said just teach your
[1:59:56] children right
[1:59:57] don't go on that was then
[2:00:01] now we have the word
[2:00:04] today
[2:00:05] but God gives a chance God's giving a
[2:00:08] chance to you today
[2:00:10] to say I don't want idolatry in my life
[2:00:13] I don't want to look at going to church
[2:00:16] and as the message as as just something
[2:00:18] that I do and
[2:00:21] something that I'm supposed to do and
[2:00:23] and make it a tradition
[2:00:26] an idolatry and we're gonna
[2:00:29] use meeting and we got a potluck and
[2:00:31] different things like that I'm just
[2:00:33] doing this because it's traditions
[2:00:35] they had Traditions set up in Bethel the
[2:00:39] house of God
[2:00:40] but Baal was present
[2:00:44] let not Baal be present in our lives or
[2:00:47] in our church this morning amen you see
[2:00:50] we say well we want the best for grace
[2:00:52] and we don't want clicks and Grace and
[2:00:54] we don't want all of these things inside
[2:00:55] of Grace Tabernacle but those are all
[2:00:58] the byproducts of your lazy Christian
[2:01:00] attitude amen
[2:01:04] if you have one
[2:01:07] that's what happens when we get lazy
[2:01:09] with the word of God
[2:01:11] lukewarm Spirit of idolatry
[2:01:15] comes in
[2:01:17] God help us let's bow our heads this
[2:01:19] morning
[2:01:23] oh Lord Jesus
[2:01:25] father as I was studying this out
[2:01:27] yesterday Lord
[2:01:29] my heart was spitting
[2:01:32] I began to think what is in my life
[2:01:36] what view do I have of scriptures or
[2:01:40] quotes
[2:01:41] that is looked on as idolatry to you
[2:01:44] Lord
[2:01:47] father thinking of situations God and
[2:01:50] people
[2:01:52] where does that leave them Lord
[2:01:55] oh God
[2:01:58] I begin to read in Ezra
[2:02:01] your people came and said we have sinned
[2:02:04] and taken these wives
[2:02:07] but we want this trespass
[2:02:09] forgiven
[2:02:12] and God you honor that
[2:02:16] for those this morning under the sound
[2:02:19] of my voice or whoever will be in the
[2:02:21] future if they stream this
[2:02:25] if they so desire that in their heart
[2:02:27] this morning
[2:02:29] I thought of her eyes
[2:02:31] heads bowed
[2:02:34] they would lift their hands
[2:02:37] my eyes are closed as well Saints
[2:02:41] [Music]
[2:02:43] I know there's idolatry in our lives
[2:02:46] this morning
[2:02:47] always God wouldn't preach this
[2:02:50] I know some of you are struggling
[2:02:54] I know
[2:02:55] [Music]
