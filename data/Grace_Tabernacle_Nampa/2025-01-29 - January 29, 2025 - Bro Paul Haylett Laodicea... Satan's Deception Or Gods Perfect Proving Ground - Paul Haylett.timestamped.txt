[12:55] oh well anyway
[13:00] we'll just declare the end of what's
[13:03] today the confusion we'll start on
[13:07] tomorrow amen we can say Amen to that
[13:10] isn't it he he's just so wonderful to us
[13:13] and he's so good to us and you know um
[13:17] just uh you know I won't go into it
[13:19] tonight but just all kinds of little
[13:21] things that happen that you realize the
[13:24] hand of the Lord is on that and uh in
[13:27] that you know we we just realize the the
[13:29] the how beautiful it is to be Sons and
[13:31] Daughters of God to be part of this
[13:34] family of God and uh tonight uh before
[13:37] we go forward I you know it's always
[13:40] when when you think about prayer
[13:42] requests and stuff and then you forget
[13:45] those and uh we want to remember uh
[13:47] brother Tim sister Maryam traveling or
[13:50] traveled to Oklahoma I think today uh
[13:53] sister Sue I know would desire to be
[13:55] remembered in prayer and our dear
[13:58] brother and sister brother pant sistera
[14:01] we want to always be faithful and I say
[14:03] God bless you to each and every one of
[14:05] you tonight and it's not snowy outside
[14:08] it's not but it just seems like the
[14:11] sometimes Wednesdays just kind of creep
[14:13] up on you had a brother contact me
[14:16] wanted to have a conversation and and I
[14:19] kind of you know it's like well maybe
[14:21] not now and then he's like it's
[14:24] Wednesday and uh you know so that's just
[14:27] kind of how things are sometimes amen so
[14:33] this evening if we could put up our our
[14:35] title I I it's kind of an interesting or
[14:39] you know different title in the way to
[14:41] to look at things but uh the title
[14:44] tonight is
[14:46] leoda Satan's deception or God's perfect
[14:50] Proving Ground And when you look at that
[14:53] we're not speaking this now to the world
[14:56] out there so it's not you know how how
[14:58] are we fitting this but my brother and
[15:01] sister God's dealing with the bride now
[15:04] we we don't want to sound oh I'm sorry
[15:07] musicians thank you okay now we'll call
[15:10] the end of the confusion for today but
[15:13] uh you know uh um the the day we're
[15:15] living in the word clearly shows us that
[15:18] there is a deception out there and and
[15:21] in that deception many people uh uh find
[15:25] themselves uh good people doing what
[15:29] they perceive as good things or
[15:31] according to the word but yet without
[15:34] wisdom and without wisdom you know we
[15:37] we'll look at that and say this is what
[15:39] we must do but looking through carnal
[15:42] eyes and carnal eyes won't do it and uh
[15:46] so you know we come so my title today is
[15:49] talking about our day our age our time
[15:53] and it's Satan's deception or you can
[15:56] make a decision
[15:59] to have it be God's Proving Ground his
[16:02] perfect Proving Ground have you ever
[16:05] thought Lord why am I here in this age
[16:08] wouldn't it been wonderful walk on the
[16:10] shores of
[16:11] Galilee except for they would have hated
[16:14] you
[16:18] then can I get one more shot at ending
[16:21] today I trust you guys had a wonderful
[16:23] anniversary time and greetings brother
[16:25] Daniel Amen so look at this my brother
[16:28] and sister you see in the day that God
[16:32] placed whatever portion of his
[16:34] bride it was the age of
[16:38] deception and it was the age of God's
[16:41] perfect Proving Ground so let's turn in
[16:45] our Bibles tonight I just want to
[16:47] explain my title a little bit so it
[16:49] wouldn't think that um uh we're here
[16:52] under Satan's deception he wants it to
[16:55] be right that's the very Spirit of leod
[16:58] deia is to deceive the people and many
[17:01] people think that it's like the flash of
[17:03] the hand that he deceives them but a lot
[17:07] of good people just studying in the
[17:09] message brother Bram lays this out a lot
[17:11] of good people just
[17:15] led to
[17:17] sleep and
[17:19] there was the
[17:22] deception they just got LED you see when
[17:25] we speak of the 10 virgins they were all
[17:28] in a sleepy
[17:30] stage it doesn't say that five virgins
[17:33] were diligent and ready on the mark it
[17:37] was a sleepy age Le
[17:41] oysa and yet there were those with an
[17:46] ear to
[17:48] hear and so God come and supernaturally
[17:51] spiritually awaken them that they heard
[17:55] the call and they had the answer already
[18:00] they didn't have to say now what do we
[18:01] do what's next they already knew amen
[18:06] let's turn 1 Corinthians 15 51-
[18:11] 58 and uh we'll just uh take this a very
[18:17] familiar scripture to
[18:19] US 1 Corinthians
[18:23] 15:51 behold I show you a mystery we
[18:27] shall not all sleep
[18:29] but we shall all be changed in a moment
[18:32] in the twinkling of an eye at the last
[18:35] Trump for the trumpet shall sound and
[18:38] the dead shall be raised
[18:40] Incorruptible and we shall be changed
[18:43] for this corruptible must put on
[18:45] incorruption and this Mortal must put on
[18:49] immortality so when this corruptible
[18:52] shall have put on incorruption and this
[18:54] Mortal shall have put on IM mortality
[18:57] then shall be brought to pass the saying
[18:59] that is written death is swallowed up in
[19:04] Victory oh death where is thy sting oh
[19:08] grave where is thy Victory The Sting of
[19:11] death is sin and the strength of sin is
[19:15] the law but thanks be to God Can someone
[19:18] say thanks be to God which giveth us the
[19:22] victory through our Lord Jesus Christ
[19:26] therefore my beloved Brethren be
[19:28] steadfast unmovable always abounding in
[19:32] the work of the Lord for as much as you
[19:34] know that your labor is not in vain in
[19:38] the
[19:39] Lord there is one of Satan's
[19:43] deceptions what I'm doing is not making
[19:47] any difference but God says that this
[19:51] work amen is not in vain amen amen keep
[19:55] pressing on Saints keep fighting weld
[19:58] the sword
[19:59] no matter how discouraging or dark it
[20:01] looks in front of us because God has
[20:04] promised not the pastor not the
[20:07] Evangelist not the prophet but almighty
[20:10] God himself through the word has told
[20:13] you your work your labor is not in vain
[20:16] Heavenly Father we ask you to bless this
[20:18] time together this evening father there
[20:21] may be just a handful of us but Lord we
[20:24] just uh we stand here tonight not to be
[20:27] counted in the crowd not to be counted
[20:29] and not to look as numbers but to be as
[20:33] Sons and Daughters of God standing in
[20:35] your presence we thank you for that ask
[20:37] for your blessings upon all the prayer
[20:39] requests all the needs all the body of
[20:42] Christ in the name of Jesus Amen you may
[20:46] be seated and we always want to you know
[20:48] everything Pops to your head uh I had to
[20:51] take a quick trip um you know uh last
[20:55] week and we was trying to meet up with
[20:58] brother Jose
[20:59] and sister sephi there in the Tri Cities
[21:02] but that didn't work but let's certainly
[21:04] remember them they're just that little
[21:06] group and uh uh you know their their
[21:10] everyday service is just uh very small
[21:13] so we want to lift them up in prayer
[21:15] amen let's go also turn to 1st Samuel 17
[21:20] starting with the 45th verse and now I
[21:23] hope that uh you know sometimes our
[21:26] thoughts would would come to a place in
[21:28] we tie things together that might not
[21:30] make sense to everyone else I pray it
[21:32] does tonight then said David to the
[21:34] Philistine now comest to me with a sword
[21:37] and with a spear and with a shield but I
[21:41] come to thee in the name of the Lord of
[21:44] hosts the god of the armies of Israel
[21:47] whom thou Hast defied this day will the
[21:50] Lord deliver thee into mine hand and I
[21:53] will smite thee and take thy head from
[21:55] thee and I will give the car Mar us of
[21:59] the host of the Philistines this day and
[22:01] to the fowls of the air and to the wild
[22:03] beasts of the earth that all the Earth
[22:05] may know that there is a God in Israel
[22:09] and I want to just look as this okay and
[22:12] all the assembly shall know that the
[22:14] Lord saveth not with the sword and spear
[22:17] for the battle is the Lord's and he will
[22:20] give you into our hands amen sister via
[22:23] if you'll just go back to the start of
[22:26] those scriptures amen thank you I'd
[22:28] forgot there was one more verse um now
[22:31] look at this my brother and sister let's
[22:32] read this scripture right now for today
[22:36] let's not look it back into Israel let's
[22:38] look into the hour we are living because
[22:41] we are serving the same God and he does
[22:44] not change so his thoughts that he
[22:46] anointed then is the same thoughts he
[22:49] will anoint today and so we're not
[22:51] trying to misplaced scripture but I
[22:53] believe there's a nice little principle
[22:55] in this and and uh you know he's talking
[22:58] to the enemy he's talking to that Spirit
[23:02] as it were there was Flesh and Blood
[23:03] there but he's talking to that that
[23:05] would desire to destroy God's chosen and
[23:08] when you look at this he's telling them
[23:10] you got a sword you got a spear you've
[23:13] got a shield but what do we have tonight
[23:15] Saints we have got the name of the Lord
[23:19] amen the name of the Lord Jesus Christ
[23:22] is everything that we need in the day
[23:25] that we live and we go out into a world
[23:27] out here and we could try to fight the
[23:30] spirit of leoda with the spirit of leoda
[23:34] and that's not going to work because
[23:35] that's already been a watered down
[23:38] misconstrued stirred up and turned out
[23:40] backwards and that wouldn't work you
[23:42] can't go I had a good friend a little
[23:44] bit of this thought come a man that used
[23:46] to live out close to us and and uh I met
[23:49] him when he was just a a a poor young
[23:52] man trying to get started farming and he
[23:55] would always come and ask me questions
[23:56] and I was always truthful to him and and
[23:59] I I one day just was so truthful I just
[24:01] had to tell him Ben you just don't quite
[24:04] have the farmer Knack you might want to
[24:06] think about doing something different
[24:08] and Ben went on and did something
[24:10] different started buying and selling
[24:12] equipment and and has now built up a
[24:15] very very large substantial business
[24:18] with many many employees and and doing
[24:21] very well and I I I saw him uh uh
[24:24] yesterday in fact and you know we're
[24:27] standing in an agriculture culture show
[24:29] in Caldwell and and all of his employees
[24:32] and salesmen are standing around hoping
[24:34] to meet someone to sell them and we're
[24:36] standing there talking about the things
[24:38] of the Lord and talking about how good
[24:41] God is and how that he has seen God
[24:44] answer so many prayers and and as we're
[24:47] talking you know I'm always trying to
[24:49] reach out a little something but
[24:52] sometimes my brother and sister the
[24:53] spirit of leod deia has put as brother
[24:56] brandham showed us it's put a religious
[24:58] spirit and that religious spirit has
[25:00] covered and everything that you can
[25:02] mention about the word of God and about
[25:05] those sayings they've got a counter to
[25:07] that but there's something missing amen
[25:10] and this is a thing that makes the
[25:12] Warfare of leoda such a scary thing is
[25:15] because men feel like they are all right
[25:18] with God even though there's something
[25:21] missing he made comments to me like he
[25:24] said you know we started going to a
[25:26] certain church and and the you know the
[25:29] wife and I under the stress of this
[25:31] business uh and and the wife and I had
[25:33] been having some strain and we went to a
[25:35] new church and that new church was
[25:37] trying out a new individual just have
[25:40] church in somebody's home in all these
[25:42] little groups and and then they come
[25:44] back together like every second or third
[25:46] Sunday and and he said you know there
[25:48] was this Minister that come to our
[25:51] church and he would speaking and when we
[25:53] walked out of the service that day my
[25:55] wife was so angry at me
[25:59] and he was like I know we have some
[26:00] disagreements I don't spend enough time
[26:02] with you and the children and and some
[26:04] things like that they didn't have
[26:05] something that was life shaking but you
[26:08] know and it's there and she come out of
[26:10] there so angry and she was just like you
[26:13] know if you were like him our marriage
[26:15] would be
[26:16] better and he says you know what Paul a
[26:20] year later it was found out what that
[26:22] man really
[26:24] was he was
[26:26] preaching to the women
[26:31] y not the
[26:33] gospel but something
[26:36] else now what the prophet say the church
[26:38] was in this day a woman I hope you can
[26:43] catch this my brother and sister you see
[26:45] we're not just preaching to any old
[26:47] woman when we get up here and preach
[26:49] we're preaching to a bride we're not
[26:52] trying to draw the woman we're trying to
[26:55] draw the bride and the bride is very
[26:58] specific because there's ownership there
[27:01] does that make sense to you and so there
[27:04] is is a such a difference in the world
[27:06] that we live in because when you preach
[27:09] to the woman you can fill a church up
[27:11] but when you preach to the bride you
[27:13] empty the church and so we see the day
[27:16] that we're living in that when we come
[27:18] we're not coming in a Warfare of Flesh
[27:21] and Blood the scripture says but we're
[27:23] coming fighting against principalities
[27:26] and powers of darkness and in that
[27:28] Warfare of the day my brother and sister
[27:30] if we do not see the true essence of the
[27:34] Warfare that we are fighting and let
[27:36] this be brother or sister tonight that
[27:38] we are looking as individuals but yet as
[27:42] the bride of Christ that God has already
[27:45] called us and prepared us and anointed
[27:48] us and put the Hedge around us job was
[27:51] not more important than you job was not
[27:54] honored by God more than you but it's
[27:57] there that God placing a hedge there
[27:59] says you know what I'm going to get you
[28:02] out of leod deia Victorious amen we
[28:06] should not be here tonight as a defeated
[28:09] people we should be here tonight with a
[28:11] mindset now I know it's easy In the
[28:13] Flesh to have a long day and the stress
[28:16] and strain of life to bring us to church
[28:19] with just a kind of a our own little
[28:21] private Cloud you know that we come into
[28:23] church with but my brother and sister
[28:25] what we should is just by exercise when
[28:28] I say that I'm talking about mechanical
[28:31] approach we should stop and say Lord I'm
[28:34] leaving the world I'm leaving everything
[28:38] that is discouraging or stressful or
[28:40] what is uncertain of tomorrow I'm
[28:42] leaving it out here in the step I don't
[28:45] even want to leave it in my car cuz I
[28:46] don't want to go back to it I'm leaving
[28:48] it out here and I'm coming in the house
[28:51] of God tonight because you promised I
[28:53] would be victorious in Leo deia now if
[28:57] we can convince ourselves enough to
[28:59] labor as we do in the flesh day after
[29:03] day week after week year after year just
[29:07] trying to provide a little bit better a
[29:10] newer car I'm not talking about fancy
[29:12] but you replace the old one and to do
[29:15] this and to do that and we'll do that in
[29:17] the Physical Realm Satan loves that
[29:20] because we get so caught up in those
[29:22] things but we ought to be able to come
[29:25] and say you know what I'm laboring in
[29:27] the gospel El in the presence of God for
[29:30] a brighter future for a better tomorrow
[29:33] that is not wealth or fame or
[29:35] prosperities blah blah blah my brother
[29:37] and sister that's a higher spiritual
[29:39] walk and as we are here in leod deia now
[29:42] God's not calling us to to absolutely
[29:45] forsake everything the Lord doesn't care
[29:48] if you have saved your whole life you
[29:51] have something a little bit nice you
[29:53] have something of that but my brother
[29:55] and sister the word shows us that we
[29:57] forsake take those things for a closer
[30:00] walk am and so as you look at this he
[30:03] David speaking to to uh the Philistines
[30:06] here speaking to this and and telling
[30:09] them you know what uh you come prepared
[30:12] for your form of
[30:15] battle you come with your attitude you
[30:19] know you can imagine Goliath the huge
[30:22] man that he was you know get up in the
[30:24] morning
[30:26] stretch pull out his
[30:32] take his
[30:35] shield grab a spear
[30:38] ready hits right on the
[30:40] mark that's why he wasn't afraid right
[30:45] he could handle a big old sword like it
[30:47] was
[30:48] nothing he could handle the shield to
[30:50] protect himself like it was
[30:53] nothing and the spear not even get close
[30:56] to me before i' drive it through your
[30:58] armor in your chest that was his
[31:02] preparation for war but not to get too
[31:06] caught up tonight my brother and sister
[31:09] God prepared a man named David and he
[31:11] walked down in the brick and you want to
[31:13] talk about spiritual leadership those
[31:16] five Stones he picked up there are some
[31:19] uh theologians that say they were just
[31:21] random stones that God anointed but I
[31:23] think we'll take a different approach to
[31:25] that that God knew exactly where he'
[31:28] stop and exactly where he'd bend over
[31:30] and exactly what stone he would pick up
[31:32] God ordained those stones to be his
[31:35] weapon and those weren't weapons of
[31:38] warfare they were weapons of Faith they
[31:40] were weapons that God chose because how
[31:45] improbable my brother and sister to
[31:47] stand at that distance and take a sling
[31:51] and throw a rock hard enough to drive it
[31:54] into a man's head
[31:58] you see there's a different approach
[32:00] because the weapon is
[32:03] not Satan's
[32:05] weapon it's God's weapon now on on uh
[32:09] Sunday we're talking about that what
[32:12] what is going to be our overcoming power
[32:14] what's going to make us Overcomer even
[32:17] our faith oh oh you didn't give me a
[32:19] chance guys I was going to say even
[32:22] brother bram's faith is going to
[32:25] make no see the thing is God's
[32:28] personalizing it just as it was with
[32:30] David it became so personal that he was
[32:34] there and if he had tried to choose
[32:36] right he already was there could have
[32:38] walked out there with Saul's armor on
[32:40] but he he knew something struck him it
[32:43] wasn't just the fact that the armor was
[32:46] too big for
[32:48] him it was the Revelation that that was
[32:51] not his way to fight the
[32:53] battle oh my brother and sister we don't
[32:56] fight the battle by trying to fill this
[32:57] Church up amen we don't fight the battle
[33:00] by trying to be known throughout the
[33:03] Nations we fight the battle by being
[33:05] faithful to God and faith comes by
[33:09] hearing the word and so the Crux of our
[33:12] world we live in today our faith amen uh
[33:16] F AI t h right is the same God's grace
[33:21] God's faith God's favor my brother and
[33:24] sister it follows all the way down
[33:26] through here God says I've got a way for
[33:29] you to fight the spirit of the age and I
[33:32] need you just to trust me cuz if you'll
[33:34] trust me you'll be victorious but if you
[33:37] go down there clunking in somebody
[33:39] else's armor you go clunking down there
[33:42] packing somebody else's sword that's it
[33:44] amen all the imitators you can go back
[33:47] through it I don't waste the time with
[33:49] names but then several swords you know
[33:51] like brother Brown said you know it
[33:53] wouldn't matter if they said they had
[33:54] the spikes that they crucified Jesus
[33:57] none of that matters but look how those
[34:00] Spirits are even in the realm of the
[34:02] message years ago several men rose up
[34:04] and say God's put that sword in my hand
[34:07] one even had a sword that was uh
[34:09] wherever he got it you know said this is
[34:11] the exact sword but no one could prove
[34:14] it wasn't except for his life proved God
[34:19] would not have placed that sword in his
[34:21] hands sounds judgmental a little bit but
[34:24] it's a truth amen so as you look at
[34:29] this was this
[34:34] boastful see it all is a matter of how
[34:37] we look at it our perspective of it some
[34:40] people would say man David was boastful
[34:43] I would have never said those words and
[34:45] that's why you've never found Victory
[34:47] that's right see you come to a place to
[34:50] be able to stand and imagine if you and
[34:52] I today would take this
[34:54] vocabulary this day the Lord will
[34:56] deliver the
[34:58] into my hand I'm talking to you to Satan
[35:01] tonight I am weak I am feeble I am
[35:04] nothing but you are going to be
[35:06] delivered into my hand by the Lord amen
[35:10] this is what is happening this is how we
[35:12] overcome remember this story where the
[35:15] prophet of God goes to that man and and
[35:17] uh uh gets that carton of cigarettes and
[35:20] sends it to that man that just couldn't
[35:22] seem to overcome smoking now my brother
[35:25] and sister it makes no sense at all for
[35:27] a minister of the Gospel a prophet of
[35:30] God to get someone to buy a carton of
[35:32] cigarettes and send it to a man that
[35:35] that just is so improbable it just don't
[35:38] make sense there's something wonky about
[35:40] this except for it wasn't wonky to the
[35:43] man that had come and when that man
[35:45] handed him that cart and the cigarettes
[35:47] and they said well what's the deal here
[35:50] oh it's from Brother
[35:51] branam boom never touches another
[35:54] cigarette tell me God doesn't know what
[35:56] he's doing God knows how to fight the
[35:59] Battle of Le oia he knows to how to
[36:02] fight the battle and make you and I
[36:04] Overcomers in this age it's not to use
[36:07] the word Overcomer like a cliche I think
[36:10] some people think that the you know when
[36:12] we're talking about overcome overcome
[36:14] overcome we just have a cliche until
[36:17] you're the one in Leo deia that has
[36:20] something you need to overcome and God
[36:23] comes on the scene and you overcome
[36:25] suddenly overcoming is a whole personal
[36:28] subject with you and it ought to be so
[36:33] he tells them you're going to be
[36:35] delivered in my hand and I'm going to
[36:37] smite thee and take thy head from thee
[36:40] my brother and sister I want you to look
[36:41] out and think about politics of the
[36:43] world
[36:45] today
[36:47] headship has been taken from this
[36:53] world rulers presidents premieres prime
[36:56] ministers
[36:58] all stumbling
[37:00] around virtually no Nation on earth now
[37:03] is not drowning in
[37:05] debt and yet you can have a 12
[37:11] 12-year-old balance a
[37:14] checkbook are you with me he's already
[37:17] taken their
[37:19] headship they are it's already taken
[37:21] from them saints s Satan is now here in
[37:26] this time only bluffing that this is his
[37:30] kingdom he already knows he read the
[37:32] word he heard it it's been taken from
[37:35] him just as sure as David speaking to
[37:38] Goliath and it came to pass the word has
[37:41] come now and taken the headship from the
[37:45] the Kings and kingdoms of leoda so now
[37:49] they're under an anointing you got to
[37:51] remember having true headship and just
[37:53] being anointed are entirely different
[37:56] things so one can be anointed to
[37:58] something remember brother brandom
[38:00] baffled a lot of people years ago when
[38:02] he said you could be anointed of the
[38:03] Holy Ghost all the days of your life and
[38:06] go to hell they were like no possible
[38:11] way but we're seeing the evidence of it
[38:14] it is happening and so here we are
[38:17] seeing this scripture brought into light
[38:20] into this day coming right to pass
[38:22] before us and so what he's doing he's
[38:24] taking their headship from him and the
[38:27] people
[38:28] he said carcass now carcass usually is
[38:30] referred to something dead what the
[38:32] prophet of God say would be the spirit
[38:34] of this
[38:35] age Yep they're carcasses it's dead and
[38:39] it's there spiritually dead they've
[38:41] missed the point they think it's about
[38:44] their
[38:45] Church be careful Saints it's not about
[38:48] you or I or the church it's about that
[38:52] relationship with the Lord and so here
[38:55] it is it we're seeing
[38:58] that in the
[38:59] end there's coming even comments being
[39:04] made in the religious
[39:06] world that
[39:09] God is more present than we thought he
[39:13] was but we're
[39:16] Christians We Believe God's omniscient
[39:20] omnipresent but not
[39:24] here if you don't think so just go
[39:26] listen no don't go listen don't waste
[39:28] your don't waste your time but I'll tell
[39:32] you the voices that are
[39:33] there are speaking in the realm of God's
[39:38] put all the power in our hands and that
[39:39] means you buy me a Lear
[39:42] jet that's what they think is religious
[39:44] that's a sign of God's
[39:46] favor I think I've got quite a ways to
[39:51] go Mattel makes Lear
[39:54] Jets they even make them now that you
[39:56] don't even need glue they just snap
[40:00] together so I hope that made sense to
[40:03] you so we live in this age and we have a
[40:06] challenge that is particular to our day
[40:08] my brother and sister the word says
[40:10] there's nothing new Under the Sun but
[40:12] God bringing this kind of particular uh
[40:15] or peculiar challenge in our day is
[40:18] because we are coming to the end of time
[40:20] there's not another age there's not
[40:22] another time God's not prepping us to go
[40:24] into another church Age We Are are
[40:27] coming down at the Fulfillment and the
[40:29] prophet of God anointed I've tried to
[40:31] trim this all down prophet of God
[40:33] anointed to say well we're not even in
[40:35] leysia any longer so if you wondered
[40:38] whether or not you defeated Le oysa hear
[40:40] me well tonight you're not even in Le
[40:43] oysa amen he said you're in the bride
[40:47] age and so it's there that we got to
[40:50] quit trying to fight the spirit of leoda
[40:54] with the weapons of leod deia we need to
[40:57] step into the bride age and fight the
[41:00] spirit of leoda with the bride's weapon
[41:03] and the bride's weapon is just such a
[41:05] simple Weapon It's called the word amen
[41:08] and when we stand on that word and we
[41:11] deal with the spirits of leoda we're
[41:13] going to knock the head off of that
[41:15] concerning our own personal lives
[41:18] there'll be no headship of the spirit of
[41:21] leoda controlling the Bride of Jesus
[41:24] Christ when the Rapture comes amen she
[41:27] will will be absolutely completely free
[41:30] from any Spirit of this age am think
[41:34] about how glorious that is my brother
[41:36] and sister no more will be knocked
[41:38] around and and buffeted we're going to
[41:41] come to the place yes they'll be
[41:43] challenged right because the prophets
[41:45] shows us that we're clearly under the
[41:48] leadership of the holy spirit so then
[41:51] Satan just wants to get you to step a
[41:53] little bit out from underneath that
[41:56] headship and and when we step out from
[41:58] underneath that headship Satan's got a
[42:00] whole big Target it's a little harder to
[42:03] stay under that headship than it sounds
[42:05] isn't
[42:07] it so the buffet of leoda is still here
[42:12] but part of it is Saints we are keeping
[42:16] ourselves in
[42:19] leoda brother brandham says the church
[42:21] should be farther along right by
[42:26] now now not to go in and start throwing
[42:29] things around but even the prophets
[42:32] acknowledging that we're kind of
[42:33] hindering this y Lord don't let it be me
[42:37] help me father I want to be the
[42:39] Overcomer that steps beyond that I don't
[42:42] want to push it off to be someone else
[42:44] but I don't want to be the one hindering
[42:47] this make sense amen so we look at this
[42:51] this age we live in we have challenges
[42:54] that are peculiar to our time
[42:58] the
[42:59] internet let's stop tonight and just
[43:02] examine the internet for a moment is it
[43:05] good or is it
[43:12] evil the mixed
[43:14] multitude it's right there yes mixed
[43:17] fruit right everything is there but you
[43:21] see my brother and sister if people
[43:23] choose for the internet to be evil it is
[43:26] evil to to them but if they choose to be
[43:29] blessed by the internet then they are
[43:33] blessed and so it can carry the gospel
[43:36] and it also can bring uh forth even I
[43:39] I've got notes on the wall I guess I'll
[43:41] preach this one of these days my brother
[43:44] and sister but but you can have
[43:46] deception hidden in
[43:49] truth amen it's it's a little take you
[43:52] might say from the trail of the serpent
[43:54] you can have deception and man preaching
[43:57] and I bring this in tied with what my
[44:00] friend spoke about he figured out they
[44:03] figured out that Spirit something wrong
[44:06] it aggravated his wife you're such an
[44:08] insufficient husband You're such you
[44:10] know a a lagered you're such a waste
[44:13] you're you're and to find out what was
[44:16] the spirit that was anointing the women
[44:19] cuz he said practically every woman in
[44:21] their church was anointed by that spirit
[44:25] and there was such chaos hit their
[44:27] church only to find out I'll just say it
[44:29] out loud only to find out the man was in
[44:32] a dozen or more uh uh Affairs at the
[44:36] very time he was speaking those words
[44:38] what was he doing in the spirit of
[44:40] adultery a leodan It's Always Been
[44:42] Through the Ages but here we are in this
[44:44] time because this is now a time that
[44:47] natural adultery is something that might
[44:49] even be easier to quit and be forgiven
[44:53] of than spiritual
[44:55] adultery natural adultery a man can come
[44:58] and bring himself and be held
[45:00] accountable to his wife and do all of
[45:02] these kind of things and do that but my
[45:04] brother and sisters spiritual adultery
[45:07] follows him day and night everywhere he
[45:10] goes that spirit is there twisting the
[45:13] word deceiving amen and no one even
[45:16] knows it's
[45:18] happening so the internet good or evil
[45:21] just like my title bringing it out you
[45:23] have to decide it all depends on how you
[45:25] look at that and you decide that it's
[45:28] good I can hear the a Bible I can hear
[45:31] this preaching I can gospel real good
[45:33] honest gospel music there's just so much
[45:36] good my brother and sister on the side
[45:39] there's a spirit for every one of those
[45:42] that's
[45:49] evil you know in that time before the
[45:52] Reformation I have some other examples
[45:53] but we'll skip over you guys got the
[45:55] point you you know in the time before
[45:57] the
[45:59] Reformation they didn't even want the
[46:01] Bible
[46:02] printed and what they said was the
[46:04] reason was is you hope you don't mind
[46:07] making a personal
[46:08] today are not intelligent enough to
[46:13] understand it it will only confuse you
[46:16] well I can tell you I lived in a world
[46:18] as a young man when Jerry and I first
[46:20] married that there was certain church
[46:23] and certain Ministries and they actually
[46:25] used that same line and when our eyes
[46:27] were open to that we realized one day we
[46:30] woke up wait this is exactly the same
[46:33] spirit that was there and God anointed
[46:37] uh men like whitecliffe and different
[46:40] ones to come and start to say there's
[46:42] something wrong here these people the
[46:45] just shall live by faith means the just
[46:49] must have the word because it's only the
[46:53] word that brings faith and so here's
[46:56] Luther coming into that movement and and
[46:58] starting to push against this whole
[47:01] spirit that that you guys just need to
[47:03] listen and do what we tell you my
[47:05] brother and sister sometimes that's good
[47:08] amen I know Brother David would know
[47:10] this I know some of the things brother
[47:11] David's gone through the years if people
[47:13] would have just stopped and listened and
[47:15] done what their Pastor or minister or
[47:18] whatever told them they would have been
[47:19] so much better off but the prophet of
[47:21] God in the resume of the ages is talking
[47:24] about how that all through those ages
[47:27] what was happening is the spirit of the
[47:29] nicians was there pushing all the time
[47:33] pushing pushing looking for an opening
[47:35] and every time they found an open
[47:37] whether it was in a church or whether it
[47:38] was in a family or a single person or
[47:40] whatever it was then that comes in there
[47:42] and starts to control their life in
[47:44] other words they're no longer trusting
[47:45] the Holy Ghost they are now trusting
[47:48] man's Wisdom so it becomes a man's
[47:51] leadership and this is the age my
[47:54] brother and sister when that nickan
[47:56] spirit has blossomed and grown to be so
[48:00] large of men telling
[48:02] men what to do or let's put it in the
[48:05] spiritual context it's men telling women
[48:08] what to do because the woman is the
[48:11] church so now you got men that believe
[48:14] they are the voice to the
[48:17] church my brother and sister the prophet
[48:19] of God countered that when he said I
[48:22] never I'll just paraphrase this I I
[48:24] never called anyone to myself that's
[48:28] right there are people say well well
[48:30] that's that's what's the whole thing
[48:31] that's why it's a cult well here again
[48:34] let me say it one more time if we're a
[48:36] cult we're the poorest managed cult on
[48:40] the face of the
[48:44] earth I want to see everyone that's
[48:46] associated come to this church I want to
[48:48] see a higher spiritual walk but pardon
[48:51] me to put this way brother Daniel you're
[48:53] never going to see me beat your door
[48:54] down and demand that you serve God
[48:58] I want to do by God's grace what I was
[49:00] called to do to minister this gospel
[49:03] where it would convince your soul where
[49:05] the Holy Spirit would deal with you at
[49:07] your level in your circumstance in your
[49:10] time and God would do it and then when
[49:12] you walk away you would never say well I
[49:14] believe the message because brother Paul
[49:16] had me in a
[49:18] headlock no I believe the message
[49:20] because the message is Jesus Christ and
[49:23] I'm in love with him I saw him in his
[49:26] Beauty and because for he first loved me
[49:29] but the beauty of his grace and creation
[49:32] and everything brings me to the place I
[49:35] can't help but love him right and then
[49:38] there's nobody can talk you out of
[49:40] something that God talked you into and
[49:43] when I use that talk to you into I don't
[49:45] mean it in the conventional form it's
[49:48] God speaking to the soul speaking to the
[49:50] seed we we understand amen amen but when
[49:55] God shows it to you
[49:57] when God's the one that come if I could
[49:59] put it in a human element and embraced
[50:01] you
[50:04] amen who's going to convince you it's
[50:07] not real that's
[50:09] right
[50:11] so they didn't want the Bible in the
[50:13] hands of the people years ago said they
[50:15] weren't capable to understand but the
[50:18] Bride of that day understood
[50:22] amen now we're here in this age and the
[50:25] same spirit is cropping its head up and
[50:29] there are those that believe it's only
[50:31] in the hands of the
[50:33] clergy and if it was only in my hands
[50:35] Saints you guys are in trouble I'm sorry
[50:39] to tell you that I mean I do my best to
[50:42] be a good pastor and a somewhat
[50:44] reasonable Minister but just follow me
[50:47] around for a day and they would say you
[50:49] know brother Paul you are Vindication or
[50:52] confirmation of one
[50:55] thing when the prophet said backslide
[50:59] daily you're the proof of that that's
[51:03] nothing to boast about but I believe
[51:05] what the prophet said and I don't feel
[51:07] condemned when sometimes I'm frustrated
[51:09] and the different things happen but
[51:11] we're not going to glory in the flesh we
[51:14] are going to look to the word and say
[51:16] Lord the prophet of God showed us we
[51:19] might backslide daily but we repent
[51:22] daily amen and we come back in your
[51:24] presence and come before you daily amen
[51:28] because that we're not left out in the
[51:30] cold of the spirit of leoda but God's
[51:32] given us opportunity to rise up into the
[51:36] bright age amen rising up into the
[51:39] position where we can look back at
[51:41] mistakes and say Lord you
[51:43] know I didn't do that amen now to the
[51:47] average carinal Christian they're going
[51:49] to say what are you talking about you
[51:50] did it but see they don't understand the
[51:52] revelation of the word that God will not
[51:55] hold one thing to the account of his
[52:01] bride just as though I never did it amen
[52:05] but that doesn't mean I go out the next
[52:06] day and do
[52:10] more something about that causes our
[52:13] heart to say Lord forgive me for
[52:16] that deliver me from that anoint me to
[52:21] never go back amen that's the spirit of
[52:26] the Holy Spirit in this day amen the
[52:30] nature I should say of the holy spirit
[52:32] in this day amen so what what struck me
[52:37] in my studies there is the very fact
[52:39] that of every age from the very first
[52:41] age every Age The Bride of that age in
[52:45] in spite of the darkness of the Dark
[52:48] Ages there was a bride who believed it
[52:51] and it wasn't a a belief of
[52:54] ignorance it wasn't a a belief
[52:57] that was connected to being
[52:59] naive but it was Revelation it was pure
[53:04] Revelation came to the Bride of every
[53:07] age and my brother and sister when we
[53:09] look at that is so incredible you know
[53:13] what I think is just
[53:16] startling is when we realize that Satan
[53:19] doesn't just want you to not get
[53:22] Revelation it'd be one thing just to try
[53:24] and block you you know
[53:27] like a mother I watched one time in a
[53:29] store convenience store they come around
[53:32] the end of an island and all the candy
[53:34] was on this side and as that mother come
[53:36] around she just switched hands on that
[53:38] little kid of hers and moved him right
[53:40] over here and the whole way down this
[53:42] deal that little kid could not see one
[53:44] drop of
[53:45] candy my brother and sister it's not God
[53:48] actually trying to hide
[53:51] us unfortunately I'd have to say we are
[53:54] IM immersed in Leo
[53:57] DEA especially you know those that just
[53:59] work in the public you know and interact
[54:01] well you know what forget about working
[54:03] in the public if you go to a grocery
[54:05] store amen you've been immersed in leod
[54:09] deia and so you look at this now but you
[54:12] know what the real issue
[54:14] is
[54:16] Satan is afraid of Revelation you bet he
[54:20] is it's not that he just doesn't want
[54:22] you to have it he's actually afraid of
[54:25] Revelation
[54:27] amen and I'll make this statement I say
[54:29] it bold the devil TR probably dig his
[54:32] Sledgehammer out and trying to hit me
[54:34] with it but he's afraid of Revelation
[54:38] and you know what that actually means
[54:39] the very depth of Satan's afraid of
[54:43] Revelation he's afraid of you that's
[54:47] right the Lord wow now I'm going to be
[54:50] brutal here don't get offended with me
[54:53] how many of you feel like Satan's afraid
[54:55] of you
[54:58] but we need to claim that thought not
[55:01] cuz I said it my brother and sister but
[55:03] the word that is in you the word that
[55:06] you say Amen whether it's verbally or in
[55:08] your heart the word that is giving you
[55:11] life is revelation and if Revelation is
[55:15] in you and Satan's afraid of Revelation
[55:18] then he's afraid of you as the bride of
[55:20] Christ people many years ago kind of
[55:24] mocked and criticized brother Johnnie
[55:26] rean because he just up in the Pulpit
[55:29] there and some of you many of you might
[55:30] have heard that but he says you know you
[55:33] stretch in the morning you wake up and
[55:35] he said you know and you roll over there
[55:37] and put your feet on the side of the bed
[55:40] they're on the floor and then the demons
[55:44] are like oh help me I need help he's got
[55:48] out of
[55:48] [Applause]
[55:50] bed we ought to believe that we ought to
[55:54] take a halz of that and say I'm going to
[55:56] live the kind of life when I get out of
[55:59] bed Satan is saying hey I need
[56:01] reinforcements over here the guy's still
[56:04] living he got out of bed and said praise
[56:07] the Lord for another day and I don't
[56:10] know how to deal with him I need
[56:11] reinforcements but you know brother
[56:13] Donnie used to break that out he said
[56:16] them other demons are out there saying
[56:18] deal with them
[56:21] yourself come
[56:24] on so Revelation in you and I I believe
[56:28] that was one of the reasons not just so
[56:30] we could see with natural eyes but
[56:31] that's one of the reasons the prophet of
[56:33] God said pray for Revelation he knew the
[56:36] power of Revelation in dealing with
[56:39] Satan
[56:42] amen you know it's
[56:45] interesting how powerful fear is yes sir
[56:49] now I I I don't think we have
[56:51] to I don't think we have to be like
[56:54] those guys that I just seen a clip of a
[56:57] video the other
[56:58] day um this guy's on the ledge of a
[57:02] building it has to
[57:06] be at least 12 stories or maybe
[57:12] more the building is being
[57:14] built the guy just goes over there sits
[57:17] down turns around drops down catches the
[57:19] edge of the balcony with his
[57:22] fingers does some one-handed chin-ups I
[57:24] can't even do those
[57:27] does some one-handed chinups then he did
[57:30] what scared me is he pulled himself up
[57:34] no hands spun
[57:36] around caught it
[57:40] again then he threw one leg up and
[57:44] balanced himself are any of you brave
[57:48] enough not 12 stories high I don't even
[57:51] know if I would do it off a back deck at
[57:53] 3 feet but do you see my brother and
[57:56] sister we're living in an age the word
[57:58] says they won't even have fear of
[58:00] anything now when you have that kind of
[58:03] a atmosphere that kind of a world that
[58:05] kind of a
[58:06] mentality do you think they're afraid of
[58:09] hell you think they're afraid have
[58:11] respect for the word natural spiritual
[58:15] you follow me you see what it is this is
[58:17] the age we're coming years ago they
[58:20] would have took a man off to Asylum for
[58:22] for doing that kind of behavior now it's
[58:24] normal and and so as it is there is this
[58:28] this faith that they have in the natural
[58:31] of their own physical strength of their
[58:33] hand their grip their balance they have
[58:36] that natural but they cannot bring that
[58:39] kind of faith into you will not bring
[58:42] natural faith into a spiritual realm
[58:46] because the natural the carnal can only
[58:48] go so far and then God designed you and
[58:52] I to trust him to go further amen and
[58:55] not we're not here to do acrobats with
[58:57] the word no you know we're not here to
[59:00] do dog and pony shows sorry to put it
[59:02] that way in the church we're not here to
[59:04] put zip lines inside the church and then
[59:06] come flying down with a cape to the
[59:09] platform we're not here to turn all the
[59:11] lights off and put all multicolored
[59:14] lights and as a visitor came to the
[59:16] church here years ago and said I I'm so
[59:18] glad to come in your church and you guys
[59:20] have your lights on you're not
[59:23] mushrooms you see but the age living in
[59:26] my brother and sister that's what
[59:28] Satan's doing because it reminds the
[59:31] people of the good experience they had
[59:34] at the last Rock concert they went to
[59:37] right the last time they dwelt in the
[59:39] dark with Spirits left them feeling warm
[59:42] and fuzzy and they don't mind that being
[59:44] replicated in church that's it
[59:48] h wow so
[59:51] close but it won't deceive the very
[59:53] elect amen now faith comes by hearing
[59:56] the word of God right that we we're all
[59:59] we're all solid on that so faith is an
[1:00:04] attribute so the word is actually if I
[1:00:06] could just do this brother Trevor if you
[1:00:08] don't mind here's the word of
[1:00:11] God I believe we're safe to say this is
[1:00:14] Faith when God anoints it right not
[1:00:17] every man can read a Bible won't do a
[1:00:19] thing for him but when God anoints that
[1:00:20] this is Faith now this Faith would come
[1:00:23] down and it will come and rest itself in
[1:00:27] the heart of the believer because he
[1:00:29] says I believe every word of that yeah
[1:00:33] but someone else it would come down and
[1:00:36] they would say that's just a
[1:00:39] Bible and N would some would say uh I
[1:00:42] see the scripture I followed it you
[1:00:44] could say that tonight with Paul I
[1:00:46] follow what he's saying but I don't
[1:00:48] agree that it's a significant as he says
[1:00:51] it is and another says if it came out of
[1:00:54] the word of God I be leave every single
[1:00:57] word see so it's matter as I'm kind of
[1:01:00] portraying tonight it's a matter of how
[1:01:03] we look at it and you know you you might
[1:01:06] find this a little bit different for me
[1:01:08] to say this I think sometimes maybe we
[1:01:11] ought to forget about the doctrine of
[1:01:13] some of these things we need to forget
[1:01:15] about oh what is the seventh seal what
[1:01:17] is this what is that we need to prove
[1:01:20] the church ages and we need to actually
[1:01:22] get into the word and let the word
[1:01:25] become us I don't need to defend the
[1:01:28] word to you my brother and sister how
[1:01:30] God deals with me and speaks with me I
[1:01:32] don't need to defend that to you even
[1:01:34] though I'm even your pastor I don't need
[1:01:36] to defend that that's how God speaks to
[1:01:38] me and I'm not going to come here and
[1:01:40] I'm not going to criticize how God deals
[1:01:42] with you because God knows the beginning
[1:01:45] from the end vice versa he knows all of
[1:01:49] this what he needs to do to get our
[1:01:53] attention amen and some times some of us
[1:01:56] pardon I'm speaking to myself so no one
[1:01:58] be offended he has to deal a little
[1:02:01] harder with the
[1:02:03] Knuckleheads they've developed calluses
[1:02:05] on their forehead from beating their
[1:02:06] head off everything they come in contact
[1:02:08] with through life and God still knows
[1:02:10] exactly how to deal with them and then
[1:02:14] you got some people that from just a
[1:02:15] little child are so
[1:02:17] soft that God just
[1:02:20] moves and they're they're not they're
[1:02:22] not little puppets they're not little
[1:02:25] mus you whatever they're real Believers
[1:02:28] but their spirit that was just born so
[1:02:32] soft that they might be six seven8 years
[1:02:35] old want to be baptized cuz God's
[1:02:38] dealing with them they this is the truth
[1:02:40] this is who I am I'm a daughter of
[1:02:42] God I'm a Son of
[1:02:48] God faith is an
[1:02:50] attribute and you know Faith does not
[1:02:53] have
[1:02:54] fear when the script scure is speaking
[1:02:56] of fear it's talking about reverence
[1:02:58] amen the fear of the Lord reverence it's
[1:03:02] not us terrified of
[1:03:06] God but Satan would like you to God's
[1:03:09] mad at me this is happening in my life
[1:03:11] God is mad at me well stop why would you
[1:03:15] offer up
[1:03:17] something that would make God
[1:03:22] mad why not offer up something that
[1:03:25] makes him happy
[1:03:26] yeah so usually when you hear
[1:03:29] that oh God's mad at me maybe I'll stop
[1:03:33] instead of pushing back look and
[1:03:37] say what could I have done I still don't
[1:03:40] believe God's mad at me he's wooing me
[1:03:43] maybe he's just hitting that
[1:03:46] callous now the way to have Fellowship
[1:03:49] here this is U 1955 brother Brown says
[1:03:52] there
[1:03:58] I got to hurry I hope you guys don't
[1:03:59] mind if I kind of start
[1:04:04] preaching fears of the devil now look at
[1:04:08] this I'm going to apply this to me so
[1:04:10] none of you can claim
[1:04:13] offense fear Makes You Weary
[1:04:18] does I don't think I've ever been as
[1:04:20] tired in my life as I am right now I
[1:04:23] feel thrashed out
[1:04:26] I feel like I can't hardly I I couldn't
[1:04:30] climb a mountain now if hardly if my
[1:04:32] life depended on
[1:04:34] it now we got to stop is that just a
[1:04:36] physical attribute or is there a spirit
[1:04:41] that is trying to make us weary the
[1:04:44] scripture saying not be weary in
[1:04:46] well-doing goes a little deeper I think
[1:04:48] than most of us give it any credit it
[1:04:51] goes right down to this level that if we
[1:04:54] are weary and wello we need to get rid
[1:04:57] of the spirit that is causing us to fear
[1:05:02] and be
[1:05:04] weary are you guys good with that I
[1:05:06] don't want to leave any confusion but
[1:05:08] you know as well as I do that when you
[1:05:10] wake up in the middle of the night and
[1:05:11] you lay there for
[1:05:13] hours that's not of God right cuz if it
[1:05:16] was God he would turn you to
[1:05:19] purpose when God wakes a son or daughter
[1:05:22] of God up in the middle of the night he
[1:05:25] doesn't leave them in turmoil he has
[1:05:29] purpose it might be for us to get things
[1:05:31] out of our life roll over put our face
[1:05:34] in the floor the pillow or whatever and
[1:05:37] cry out to him but it has purpose but
[1:05:40] Satan just comes and robs our peace and
[1:05:45] then we wake up we're
[1:05:47] troubled we're
[1:05:50] worried and we're weary yeah right fear
[1:05:53] makes you wonder y and if I was going to
[1:05:57] die in the morning what good would it do
[1:05:59] to get all stewed up about it you know
[1:06:01] that's actually quite a profound
[1:06:03] statement because when I read this quote
[1:06:06] which I've read it many times when I
[1:06:07] read this quote I thought oh Lord help
[1:06:10] me I got so far to go cuz I would be
[1:06:13] worried worried
[1:06:15] so cuz would it be painful will it be
[1:06:19] slow what will it
[1:06:21] be oh isn't that so unreasonable
[1:06:25] be worried about something that would be
[1:06:28] out of your
[1:06:29] control oh
[1:06:32] wait the footsteps that's right of the
[1:06:36] righteous we were going to die in the
[1:06:39] morning it would have to be in God's
[1:06:41] plan am H what if I was going to be
[1:06:46] electrocuted in the morning my life had
[1:06:48] to end tomorrow morning what good would
[1:06:50] it do me to worry about it well you say
[1:06:53] what good would it do to have faith well
[1:06:56] faith can sign my pardon amen amen sure
[1:07:00] there's value in faith don't be weary
[1:07:02] don't be scared don't be upset just have
[1:07:05] faith and believe and the only way you
[1:07:08] can have faith you have to have love
[1:07:11] amen first look at how this is brought
[1:07:14] in oh I need I need faith for
[1:07:18] healing what what's keeping that what's
[1:07:21] keeping me from that I should say might
[1:07:24] be this little thought that we got
[1:07:27] against someone amen might be a little
[1:07:30] underlying thing that that we're a
[1:07:32] little bit
[1:07:35] bitter and we can't figure out why we're
[1:07:37] not
[1:07:38] healed and it could just be this little
[1:07:41] thing over here when we come to the
[1:07:42] place we'd say Lord I I'm sorry and we
[1:07:46] deal with that and straighten it up
[1:07:47] there's no roadblocks at all that's it
[1:07:50] you know it's so
[1:07:53] interesting now we don't want to be like
[1:07:55] a little video I saw happened over in
[1:07:57] Germany they had fast traffic some kind
[1:07:59] of construction thing so they set
[1:08:01] barriers here and then little distance
[1:08:04] and they set barriers here so the
[1:08:06] traffic could still go but it had to go
[1:08:08] like this well it turns out this man is
[1:08:10] in a big truck and he has fallen asleep
[1:08:13] and he comes down there gets to the
[1:08:15] first barrier you know he wasn't afraid
[1:08:17] of that barrier he was oblivious to the
[1:08:20] barrier and the people on the other
[1:08:22] sides of the barrier were all confident
[1:08:24] we're behind the barrier
[1:08:26] but when that truck plowed through every
[1:08:28] one of those barriers and went all the
[1:08:30] way through and kept
[1:08:33] going all the natural confidence that
[1:08:37] there was in the work of the barrier was
[1:08:40] for not and unfortunately for the man
[1:08:43] that was in the cab of the truck his
[1:08:45] attention he was actually
[1:08:47] asleep was all for
[1:08:50] not I think he got sentenced to prison
[1:08:53] or something for that you see we don't
[1:08:56] want to have a false confidence I'm in
[1:08:59] God I'm in Christ God gave job a hedge
[1:09:03] he's obligated to give me a hedge but
[1:09:06] I'm here to tell you just bear with me
[1:09:09] it was on Sunday that God told Satan
[1:09:13] that he would open the Hedge and we're
[1:09:15] over here praise God I'm the bride of
[1:09:17] Christ I've got a hedge around me God
[1:09:21] might have said I see a little speck of
[1:09:23] something there I think I'll let the
[1:09:25] devil come in and we'll just burn that
[1:09:29] Speck right out of you you see we we
[1:09:32] don't want to become arrogant or proud
[1:09:35] serving God should we be confident as I
[1:09:37] started the service to say I'm a Son of
[1:09:39] God and God's in control and Satan I
[1:09:42] bind you in the name of Jesus Christ
[1:09:45] that's not you that's him that's not
[1:09:48] confidence in us it's confidence in him
[1:09:53] and that's what he gave us to fight the
[1:09:55] Battle of leoda is a confidence in him
[1:10:01] amen cuz this flesh will fail
[1:10:04] us okay what good would it do only way
[1:10:07] you can have faith you got to have love
[1:10:09] first for love produces faith for
[1:10:11] perfect love get it perfect love casts
[1:10:14] out all fear and what is the spirit of
[1:10:17] this day my brother and sister the
[1:10:18] prophet of God talks about we're coming
[1:10:20] into an age of
[1:10:22] neurotics what is the basis of neurotics
[1:10:26] fear anxiety fear amen amen God has cast
[1:10:31] out fear that's right and we're here to
[1:10:34] stand and say you know what if God's
[1:10:36] calling me yeah God called me to be a
[1:10:39] Son of God called me to be a daughter of
[1:10:40] God I need to banish every fear of what
[1:10:44] it will be like to serve him 100% we
[1:10:48] need to stand and say if he called me
[1:10:50] he's provided for me made the way for me
[1:10:53] everything I'll need is already been
[1:10:55] supplied to me and then when you walk
[1:10:58] out in leod deia everything can go wrong
[1:11:01] around you spirits and the Warfare and
[1:11:04] you can walk and say it's already
[1:11:06] provided it's already provided he's
[1:11:09] already provided all the peace I need
[1:11:12] all the forgiveness I need all I need
[1:11:14] every anointing I need everything's
[1:11:17] already been provided and that's how
[1:11:20] we're going to fight the spirit of leoda
[1:11:22] it won't be with us going around getting
[1:11:24] a bigger
[1:11:25] it won't be us going out and going back
[1:11:27] and telling uh uh telling them you know
[1:11:31] I'll take that Armor after all Saul can
[1:11:33] I can I actually get that armor I I
[1:11:35] think I think you're right I need that
[1:11:37] armor you imagine that sord draging
[1:11:40] behind David The Shield takes two arms
[1:11:44] to hold up how could he even fight a
[1:11:48] battle when it took two
[1:11:51] hands no my brother and sister David
[1:11:54] went out there not arrogant not boastful
[1:11:57] and certainly not
[1:11:59] naive and the Bride of this age believes
[1:12:02] the word of this age and she is not
[1:12:05] arrogant she's not proud and she's not
[1:12:08] naive she knows what God promised she's
[1:12:11] counting on it she's standing on the
[1:12:14] word
[1:12:16] amen okay let's
[1:12:19] go Revelations 19 um you know the
[1:12:23] scripture amen you see we can look at
[1:12:25] this for this righteousness of the
[1:12:28] Saints see God's provided and described
[1:12:31] it give us a very clear description of
[1:12:34] what righteousness is it's not self-made
[1:12:37] not
[1:12:38] self-promoted and will never actually be
[1:12:40] supported by
[1:12:42] self we have righteousness today and we
[1:12:45] step away from God we'll find that we
[1:12:48] won't have righteousness
[1:12:50] tomorrow that's how many a believer that
[1:12:53] has been a Believer for a long time got
[1:12:54] anoint Ed with those spirits and said
[1:12:56] well we've always been Believers we can
[1:12:59] go out here just a little
[1:13:02] further and when they got out there they
[1:13:05] woke up one day or maybe never woke up
[1:13:08] yeah and their righteousness is
[1:13:10] gone there's only righteousness in the
[1:13:14] fine linen of God's
[1:13:17] garment and God's garment is the word
[1:13:20] amen that's what he's covering us with
[1:13:22] let's go to the way to have Fellowship
[1:13:25] sister
[1:13:26] via
[1:13:31] amen maybe I'm looking at the wrong
[1:13:36] one okay
[1:13:39] sorry I got ahead of myself
[1:13:42] preaching do you guys ever do
[1:13:46] that no no not
[1:13:48] preaching just get ahead of
[1:13:52] yourself you know sometimes we we get
[1:13:55] into something and you know
[1:14:00] anyway 1 John 4:18 says there's no fear
[1:14:03] in love but perfect love casts out fear
[1:14:07] because fear hath torment and he that
[1:14:09] feareth is not made perfect in love amen
[1:14:12] Who Wants to Be Perfect tonight amen by
[1:14:15] the word of God
[1:14:17] hallelujah amen day by day A Closer Walk
[1:14:20] sister Ruth please
[1:14:22] come Hallelujah
[1:14:25] you know as I was studying this and
[1:14:27] putting this all together I thought oh
[1:14:30] my uh how do how do I bring this out but
[1:14:33] my brother and sister I hope that it
[1:14:35] came I hope you understand where we're
[1:14:37] coming from but you see our weapon of
[1:14:40] our Warfare in this age has nothing to
[1:14:43] do with the church I'm going to just say
[1:14:45] bold it has nothing to do with the
[1:14:48] message as per
[1:14:51] se if it did every man woman family that
[1:14:56] had the message in their bookcase would
[1:14:59] have the
[1:15:03] answer the answer to the Battle of Le
[1:15:07] oysa we can sum it all
[1:15:10] up but it's sumed simply in a
[1:15:14] relationship with Jesus Christ because
[1:15:17] without that relationship you can't even
[1:15:19] have
[1:15:20] faith and the scripture says faith is
[1:15:24] our Avenue
[1:15:25] to
[1:15:27] overcome just like the scripture says
[1:15:29] you can't even say that Jesus is the
[1:15:32] Christ without the Holy Ghost a lot of
[1:15:36] people say that he's the
[1:15:38] Christ but the evidence is not there and
[1:15:41] I don't say that judgmentally it just
[1:15:42] shows you that we got to interpret this
[1:15:45] by the word not by our
[1:15:49] thoughts we
[1:15:51] are going to win this battle Amen in
[1:15:54] fact to put it correctly from the word
[1:15:56] we've already won
[1:16:01] amen thank you for your
[1:16:03] patience amen may we day by day just
[1:16:06] have a closer
[1:16:08] walk amen let's just stand as we put up
