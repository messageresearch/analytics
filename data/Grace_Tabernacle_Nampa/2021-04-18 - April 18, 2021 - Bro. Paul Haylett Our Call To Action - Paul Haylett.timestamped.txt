[34:13] remember our brother sergey he's
[34:15] in north carolina where he was anyway
[34:19] last night
[34:20] uh there with um sister yulia's
[34:23] uh family and uh just good
[34:26] shared a picture and stuff and just
[34:29] remember the
[34:30] whole family you know sister yulia's
[34:33] brother
[34:33] philip i go all the way back met him the
[34:36] first time
[34:37] uh at uh um brother ivan's sister
[34:40] uh nadia's wedding and um
[34:44] i just really love him and you know
[34:45] sometimes the devil wants to stir the
[34:47] pot
[34:48] cause little ism scissors things so just
[34:51] just remember all of her family
[34:54] and lift them up before the lord uh
[34:57] brother chris
[34:58] uh and sister kristin um
[35:02] are camping i believe so we'll just
[35:04] remember them for traveling mercies
[35:05] today
[35:06] and um so just good to be here today and
[35:10] i just really
[35:11] was happy to receive this phone call
[35:13] yesterday
[35:14] uh morning uh my brother george
[35:17] sends his greetings to you he
[35:19] appreciates your prayers he
[35:22] he let me know that maybe the news that
[35:24] was spread was maybe a little overstated
[35:26] he wasn't
[35:27] um he wasn't about dead when he went to
[35:30] the hospital
[35:31] unresponsive um he i i won't
[35:35] i won't put it out kind of some of the
[35:37] words that he said but
[35:38] he just said you know sometimes your
[35:40] family overreacts
[35:42] and uh so but it's better overreact than
[35:46] under react and
[35:47] um the lord just touching him and we
[35:49] have to remember brother george is
[35:51] getting
[35:51] getting a little bit older and uh he
[35:54] just got back from
[35:55] colombia south america uh you know so
[35:58] he he's committed he is not going to
[36:01] stop
[36:02] traveling the world sharing the gospel
[36:04] until the lord calls him home
[36:05] so you know i just um i just like to see
[36:09] him
[36:10] you know be alive and remain at the
[36:12] coming of the lord still preaching the
[36:14] gospel so
[36:15] definitely uh continue to lift him up in
[36:18] prayer
[36:19] and so we try to hold him hostage to
[36:22] commitments and
[36:23] when he's healthy he says he'll do his
[36:25] very best to come see us so
[36:27] pray for him amen let's just
[36:30] stand to our feet this morning for the
[36:33] reading of the word
[36:34] once again speaking on this overall
[36:37] topic of
[36:38] redemptions manifestation
[36:41] you know i struggled for a title this
[36:43] morning as it were
[36:45] but i believe that we can maybe take
[36:48] this as an
[36:49] overall encompassing uh title or call to
[36:52] action that's what the word has
[36:54] done for you and i it's called us to
[36:56] action
[36:57] not to just sit and say well okay if god
[37:01] wants it to happen it'll happen
[37:02] but there's something in the heart of
[37:04] sons and daughters of god now
[37:06] you know we know this is not a works
[37:07] gospel right it's not going to be that
[37:09] we've done great deeds and therefore
[37:11] we're rewarded for them
[37:13] but it's all christ but remember
[37:16] we were chosen right that's what the
[37:18] word says we were chosen
[37:20] in him so therefore we are part of him
[37:24] right we're we're not just some after
[37:26] thought or some
[37:28] thing that's out there but before the
[37:30] foundation of the world god said i'm
[37:31] gonna
[37:32] i'm gonna call you and so while many
[37:34] people there's different
[37:36] doctrines different teachings that
[37:38] believe that you can kind of work your
[37:39] way to heaven
[37:41] this call of action that is taking place
[37:45] in the life of sons and daughters of god
[37:49] is not an obligation that we must do
[37:52] but there's just something in us can we
[37:54] say amen to that today there's just
[37:56] something
[37:57] in us that we read the word of god we
[37:59] hear the word of god preached and
[38:01] something in us says
[38:02] i want to do that i want to be part of
[38:05] that
[38:06] and uh you know as an old friend of mine
[38:08] used to say he was quite competitive in
[38:10] sports and
[38:12] and uh he would say everyone
[38:16] wants to be on the winning team
[38:19] but you know the reality of that is not
[38:21] true
[38:23] some are not willing to pay the price to
[38:26] be on the winning team
[38:28] and you look at that to sacrifice even
[38:31] in the natural that is required
[38:33] uh you know i had a friend that was
[38:36] quite
[38:37] quite accomplished in sports uh
[38:40] he is you know christian believer
[38:44] invited to go play soccer
[38:48] for madrid and those of you that know
[38:50] anything about soccer know that they're
[38:52] one of the big national
[38:53] world level teams invited to go play
[38:57] soccer for them
[38:59] and um it's it's a very lovely story and
[39:02] for the sake of time we won't go into it
[39:04] but to recognize that
[39:08] it's not just i'm talented and i can
[39:10] kick a ball and i can make it go where i
[39:12] wanted to go
[39:13] there was extreme sacrifice that was
[39:16] involved
[39:17] now this brother his father is a pastor
[39:21] a very godly man a very sincere man
[39:24] and he he put the question to his
[39:28] son and says son
[39:31] um what is it that you want to do what
[39:34] where where is your where is your
[39:37] direction in life and
[39:39] and he says i i love soccer dad and he
[39:42] says what other
[39:43] direction there's a certain young lady
[39:45] of which he is married now and
[39:47] and they have a couple children very
[39:48] happily married
[39:50] and his father was very troubled
[39:53] and the lord woke him up one night and
[39:56] said give this word
[39:57] to your son and
[40:01] the word was if you go
[40:05] you'll never serve me
[40:11] pretty strong words
[40:16] and for one that had a passion for
[40:17] something
[40:21] he had to stop and say what is my real
[40:22] goal
[40:24] who am i what is important to me
[40:29] and what sacrifice am i willing to make
[40:32] but then when god using his own father
[40:35] natural father says
[40:36] if you go you'll never serve me
[40:41] you see god was putting the period on
[40:44] the end
[40:44] it's no longer a question mark it's a
[40:47] period
[40:50] and i'm going to make a profound
[40:51] statement to you saints that when it
[40:53] comes to action
[40:55] there are certain actions
[40:59] you don't need to pray about
[41:03] you see my dear friend did not need to
[41:05] go and
[41:07] pray and say now lord if my dad is right
[41:10] and you really did speak to him
[41:13] is this really what is going to happen
[41:16] see he knew his
[41:17] unnatural dad who is also his pastor
[41:21] he knew him as a godly man
[41:24] he didn't need to say okay god is this
[41:26] the final answer
[41:28] is this what it he had heard the word
[41:33] the word says you go you will never
[41:36] serve me now think about this
[41:39] he was only going to be on probation as
[41:42] a soccer player and they were going to
[41:43] give him a house and a car and a few
[41:45] hundred thousand dollars
[41:47] the carnal attraction is so incredible
[41:54] but he heard the word of the lord he
[41:57] didn't
[41:57] need to pray about it that's right he
[42:00] needed to
[42:01] either accept it as truth or not
[42:04] now let me just apply this to several
[42:06] things we won't go into it's not really
[42:08] my thought today
[42:10] the scripture says by his stripes
[42:16] you're healed
[42:20] do you have to go pray about lord is it
[42:22] your will that i'm healed
[42:28] take action scripture says
[42:31] if you'd repent and be baptized
[42:36] you'd receive the gift of the holy ghost
[42:40] do you have to pray about that
[42:46] you see there's some things we just need
[42:48] to come to saints that we simply
[42:50] accept what the word said at
[42:53] face value we don't have to go and say
[42:56] does that apply to
[42:58] me is this what i should do should i
[43:01] claim my healing
[43:02] should i claim the holy ghost no accept
[43:06] it
[43:06] take action these are the declarations
[43:10] if i would use that word
[43:12] of the scripture that god drove the post
[43:18] as a friend of mine put it this way he
[43:20] says you know i don't understand what's
[43:22] wrong now
[43:23] forgive me those of you live in the city
[43:29] most of you forgive me
[43:32] but a friend of mine is like what part
[43:34] of no trespassing
[43:37] do these city people not understand
[43:43] it says no
[43:46] trespassing now my brother and sister
[43:49] let me turn that around for example
[43:52] when the word says yes
[43:56] don't accept no from anyone else
[43:59] when the word says receive don't say
[44:03] i'll have to go see if that applied to
[44:05] me
[44:06] act on the word take action
[44:10] hallelujah amen our call to action
[44:15] praise the lord let's go into the
[44:17] scripture in first samuel the second
[44:19] chapter verses one through three
[44:21] now saints i just want to clarify
[44:23] something with you and
[44:25] um you know we started in this
[44:26] redemption series
[44:28] uh to speak on the three kinds of
[44:31] believers but i'll just be honest with
[44:33] you i'm having
[44:34] a very very hard time uh
[44:37] fulfilling that because i find myself
[44:42] drawn well let me put it this way
[44:47] the only excitement there is is
[44:49] preaching to the believer
[44:52] i i i can't get excited i mean it's
[44:54] necessary but i can't get excited about
[44:57] preaching to the person that's going to
[44:59] reject all that god has offered
[45:02] and say nope i want this moment of
[45:05] pleasure
[45:06] i'm going to do what i'm going to do
[45:11] and it's hard to focus
[45:15] and really present or pour yourself into
[45:18] preaching to the person
[45:20] that goes through all
[45:23] of the labor
[45:28] they live right they talk right
[45:32] they dress right they go to church
[45:37] but they just can't quite take
[45:41] the last step i
[45:44] i'll be honest with you i i just
[45:46] struggle with the idea of getting
[45:48] excited about preaching to somebody
[45:50] that's going to run the race now let
[45:52] this is a poor analogy but i think it's
[45:54] very vivid enough
[45:56] they run the race with all that is
[45:58] within them and they get to the finish
[45:59] line
[46:00] and they say well i've got close enough
[46:03] everyone knows i'm a finisher
[46:04] i could cross that line but they don't
[46:10] you know in the natural we would look at
[46:11] them and say
[46:13] what's wrong with you
[46:16] i don't know if you've seen the little
[46:17] video that had circulated some time back
[46:20] i believe the man was from kenya they
[46:22] were running i
[46:23] don't remember i believe it was either a
[46:25] steeple chase or a marathon
[46:27] reason i think it was a steeple chase is
[46:29] because it was in hilly terrain but it
[46:31] could still been a marathon
[46:33] and this this man is exhausted i mean he
[46:36] has run the race but he has a
[46:37] substantial lead
[46:39] on the closest person and it comes to
[46:41] this two or three angled intersection
[46:44] and the way the sign is it's there
[46:46] saying finish line
[46:48] but it didn't really clearly point it
[46:50] out
[46:53] and it had some ribbons that kind of
[46:55] went off to the side
[46:56] but this man comes and he's exhausted
[46:58] and he stops and he's got his hands on
[47:00] his knees
[47:02] he thought finish line
[47:06] but you see the finish line was over
[47:08] here another 100 yards
[47:11] and the man who was behind him second
[47:13] place
[47:15] got roundly criticized around the world
[47:18] for not just passing him and winning
[47:22] but he realized this man did not stop
[47:25] because he
[47:26] gave up he stopped
[47:30] because it was confusing
[47:33] where the finish line was and he thought
[47:36] he had reached it
[47:40] and the man in his exhaustion is stopped
[47:42] there and this guy there's a language
[47:44] barrier
[47:45] praise god the holy ghost doesn't know
[47:46] language barriers
[47:48] this man comes and he's trying to talk
[47:50] to him and he's motioning
[47:52] and he's trying to gesture and he knew
[47:54] just a few words of french and
[47:55] he's trying to do it and finally just
[47:57] takes a holds of this man
[47:59] if you ever find the video you'll see it
[48:01] it's just beautiful he takes a hold of
[48:02] this man
[48:03] and the man ends up putting his arm
[48:05] around him and he leads him
[48:06] to the finish line and when he gets
[48:08] right to the line
[48:10] he stops and pushes the man across in
[48:12] front of him
[48:13] and everybody said you could have won
[48:15] the prize you could have had the title
[48:17] why didn't you do this and he says
[48:19] because i couldn't have faced my mother
[48:26] come on oh my brother and sister i say
[48:30] god help us i'm sorry i can't get
[48:32] excited
[48:33] that man didn't quit somebody confused
[48:36] him something confused him
[48:37] there's a lot of difference between the
[48:39] confusing confusion of the end time
[48:43] and the desire to reach the finish line
[48:46] so let's not get confused there but what
[48:48] about those that run the race and simply
[48:49] stop
[48:54] reminds me another video i hope you
[48:55] don't mind share this i want to drive
[48:57] these points home to you
[48:58] of a young man running i think it was in
[49:00] the college level
[49:02] he just flat out runs everyone and he
[49:05] gets up to the finish line
[49:06] and he's already jumping up in the air
[49:08] ah yeah
[49:09] yeah yeah yeah and this other guy
[49:16] let's not celebrate too early
[49:20] which means giving up stopping
[49:23] losing our focus
[49:27] we have a call to action part of that
[49:30] action
[49:31] finish the race you've been given the
[49:34] ability
[49:34] you've been called finish the race don't
[49:38] let anything
[49:38] stop you from finishing the race
[49:42] first samuel second chapter verses one
[49:44] through three
[49:45] and hannah prayed now first samuel here
[49:48] such a lovely lovely scripture
[49:50] uh we see a a a a daughter of god
[49:54] anointed of god
[49:55] you know she's had struggle in her life
[49:58] people have judged her for not having a
[49:59] child
[50:01] and you know even even the priest
[50:04] is hard on her because he sees her just
[50:07] you know
[50:07] in another realm she's just slipped off
[50:09] into another realm
[50:11] and and she is crying out to god and and
[50:13] the priest thinks that she's either
[50:15] drunk or crazy
[50:19] but she knows her heart and she says no
[50:22] no no
[50:23] i'm i'm clean of heart i'm i'm coming
[50:26] before god honestly what i'm doing
[50:28] and you look at this now it says and
[50:31] hannah prayed
[50:32] and said my heart rejoices in the lord
[50:36] my horn is exalted in the lord
[50:40] my mouth is enlarged over mine
[50:43] enemies because i rejoice in thy
[50:46] salvation
[50:47] there is none holy as the lord
[50:50] there is none beside thee neither
[50:54] is there any rock like our god
[50:57] i say we can pray hannah's prayer we can
[51:00] speak hannah's words
[51:02] talk no more so exceedingly proud
[51:05] proudly
[51:07] let not arrogancy come out of your mouth
[51:10] for the lord is a god of knowledge and
[51:13] by him
[51:14] actions are weighed and only by him it
[51:18] doesn't matter what anyone else thinks
[51:20] it's how god judges the action
[51:24] now let's remember we have god's words
[51:26] in written form
[51:28] so we can't say the lord told me and go
[51:31] conquer
[51:32] contrary to this right so there's no
[51:35] going off deviating
[51:37] and saying well the lord told me to do
[51:39] this but it's by
[51:41] our action or reaction to this
[51:45] that we are weighed heavenly father we
[51:48] thank you today for your grace
[51:50] for your mercy lord just bless our
[51:52] visitors father
[51:53] you bless each one father those that are
[51:55] not with us today
[51:56] may your holy spirit just reach out and
[51:58] touch in the name of jesus christ we
[52:00] pray
[52:01] amen you may be seated
[52:08] you see we've been given a call to
[52:10] action
[52:12] and in that my brother and sister we
[52:14] will find that
[52:16] the response to the call to action
[52:19] is very interesting um
[52:23] you'll see some believe that the church
[52:26] was called to activism
[52:28] and uh to to take up a cause and by its
[52:31] definition you might say that that would
[52:33] be true but
[52:34] also by its definition it says it's
[52:36] mostly
[52:38] centered in a political or social realm
[52:41] and so that we as the church my brother
[52:43] and sister
[52:44] uh are called to share the gospel
[52:48] now my brother and sister the word of
[52:50] god the world's full of bibles
[52:52] but yet you'll come and and as brother
[52:54] berry coffee has
[52:56] great connections in africa uh there are
[52:58] still
[52:59] christians new believers that have no
[53:02] access to a bible
[53:03] uh bibles that literally are so worn out
[53:06] the pages are falling out of them and
[53:08] and so you look at that and realize that
[53:11] that
[53:11] uh the life that is in the word of god
[53:15] it is not just something we share you
[53:17] don't just give a bible and assume
[53:19] that's going to
[53:20] make the difference in a person's life
[53:23] but there has to be the gospel which is
[53:25] the life behind the word
[53:27] and so if we have a call to activism to
[53:31] take up a cause
[53:32] uh as a church and if we focus into
[53:35] political or social realms
[53:37] now my brother and sister i'm going to
[53:38] say some very direct things so
[53:40] please don't be offended but my brother
[53:42] and sister you can go stand on a street
[53:44] corner
[53:45] and be identified and you can hold up a
[53:47] sign that condemns the actions of others
[53:49] all you want but that will not change
[53:52] their life
[53:53] amen activism to go and shout in
[53:55] people's face and push
[53:57] and do all of these things force your
[54:00] literature or
[54:00] thoughts upon others and say well we're
[54:03] the church we're called to do this
[54:05] that's a misunderstanding of going to
[54:07] all the world amen
[54:09] and so while we want to do that we will
[54:11] find that we will have a greater change
[54:14] or
[54:14] influence on the lives around us when
[54:16] those people recognize that we
[54:18] are not of this world when we are not
[54:21] like everyone else you might say
[54:23] so it's there that uh this call to
[54:25] activism
[54:26] uh just you know sometimes little
[54:28] influences come and
[54:30] just listening to a pastor and
[54:32] circumstance i won't get specific or
[54:34] take the time
[54:35] but you know talking about we need to
[54:37] rise up and
[54:38] we need to to be in this certain
[54:40] church's defense
[54:41] we need to do this we need to force our
[54:43] legislature to do this and this
[54:46] my brother and sisters see they're
[54:47] losing focus the energy that they should
[54:50] have preaching the gospel
[54:52] the changing of lives is now spent or
[54:55] burnt up
[54:56] in activism so it's there that we
[54:59] realize
[55:00] we do at the right time according to the
[55:02] leadership of the holy spirit
[55:03] need to raise up our voices not be muted
[55:06] not be quiet
[55:07] but my brother and sister is not to go
[55:09] out into the realm
[55:10] i'm just reading a little article the
[55:12] other day uh these people believe that
[55:14] by 2030
[55:16] with a good pressure from christians
[55:19] that we can change the fundamental
[55:21] direction of the united states
[55:23] but i'm telling you that united states
[55:26] has made her decision
[55:27] she values her position she has
[55:30] she's rich and has need of nothing but
[55:33] yet she is
[55:34] poor and naked and blind this is
[55:36] according to the word of god
[55:38] so we'll recognize that a misguided
[55:40] understanding
[55:42] of what an action or the actions we're
[55:45] called to as christians
[55:47] leads people into this political or
[55:49] social realm
[55:50] believing that's what's going to change
[55:52] people's lives
[55:53] what changes lives is the presence of
[55:57] god and not having a form
[56:00] of godliness but having god
[56:03] on the inside amen so a new birth is
[56:07] what changes people
[56:08] greatest form if you want to call it
[56:10] activism that's great
[56:11] the greatest form of activism we should
[56:13] be searching for
[56:15] is a new birth amen there is something
[56:17] that will change a life
[56:19] forever amen now activism
[56:22] requires uh time and commitment you know
[56:26] part of this same deal that i was
[56:27] reading they're looking for people
[56:30] that will go and stand on the steps of
[56:32] their state capital
[56:33] seven days a week lest they forget that
[56:36] we the people
[56:37] well my brother and sister that requires
[56:40] great time
[56:41] great commitment someone's going to miss
[56:43] church
[56:46] that is if they attend
[56:50] see you can be religious and not bother
[56:53] to fulfill the word of god
[56:56] you can take a position and say well you
[56:59] know the churches are messed up the
[57:00] preachers are messed up all of this i
[57:02] don't need to go to church because
[57:04] they're messed up
[57:05] well that doesn't get you around the
[57:07] word of god amen so it's not a
[57:10] you know get out of jail free it's not a
[57:12] pass go collect 200 exemption card
[57:15] i don't care what your thinking is what
[57:16] does the word say
[57:18] the word says you won't forsake the
[57:20] assembling of yourselves together as you
[57:21] see that day approaching
[57:23] so either they don't see that day
[57:24] approaching or they don't believe their
[57:26] bible
[57:27] and it comes down just pretty basic amen
[57:30] i hope this is not too straight
[57:32] so there nowhere in the scripture
[57:36] and this is just something that struck
[57:37] me i put down on the page here
[57:40] nowhere in this scripture says go into
[57:42] all the world and be an activist
[57:52] hallelujah
[57:54] but we've been called with supernatural
[57:56] calling
[57:58] you say brother paul you you bring that
[58:00] up a lot that's right because the
[58:02] devil's out here trying to tell you
[58:04] that you're not the devil constantly
[58:07] bombarding
[58:08] us with all the reasons why
[58:11] not well it should be
[58:14] fair time fair game to just bombard you
[58:18] with all the reasons why
[58:22] amen but have you ever noticed now you
[58:24] might not
[58:25] unless you delve in this realm that
[58:28] people will
[58:30] be bombarded by the devil and just build
[58:32] a tolerance to that but when they come
[58:33] to church they need to hear something
[58:35] new and exciting
[58:38] they don't want to hear the same old
[58:40] gospel
[58:41] they want to hear something that gets
[58:44] them excited
[58:48] but you see it's actually the scripture
[58:50] declares that
[58:51] me brother david brother chris is good
[58:54] ministers of the gospel
[58:56] we're not going to come and bring you
[58:57] something new and exciting
[58:59] we're going to come the scripture says
[59:01] and stir up your pure minds in
[59:04] remembrance
[59:05] of what has already been brought to you
[59:09] so i'm sorry if i'm not too exciting
[59:11] with something new
[59:13] but i do want to do my job of stirring
[59:15] up your pure minds
[59:17] well i want to stir
[59:20] up your pure mind right not corrupted
[59:24] minds
[59:26] pure minds this is god's outlook or
[59:28] god's view to you as
[59:30] pure mind and my job is just to keep
[59:33] stirring it up
[59:34] remember he said this about you remember
[59:36] he said this about you remember he said
[59:38] this about you
[59:41] hallelujah i don't have to have
[59:43] something new i just have to stir up
[59:44] your pure mind
[59:46] that you remember he called you
[59:48] righteous and he called you holy and he
[59:50] called you worthy
[59:51] and he called you his
[59:54] we just stir up the pure mind in
[59:57] remembrance of those things
[59:59] the devil says well you know look you
[1:00:01] can still serve him and
[1:00:03] kind of serve me too but you know the
[1:00:06] word of god says that
[1:00:08] a man cannot have two masters he's going
[1:00:12] to
[1:00:14] follow one and loath the other
[1:00:18] follow one forsake the other
[1:00:21] now you say i'll follow one part time
[1:00:23] and one part time the scripture
[1:00:25] says that a man that's unstable is in
[1:00:27] unstable
[1:00:29] in all of his ways so there's no this
[1:00:32] wishy-washy going back and forth right
[1:00:36] so we have to decide and this is why
[1:00:38] i've had a trouble my brother and sister
[1:00:40] preaching on the other two
[1:00:42] segments because you see i'm not
[1:00:44] interested
[1:00:45] i am interested in the people themselves
[1:00:48] but i'm not
[1:00:49] interested in the concept of or the
[1:00:52] presentation of that um
[1:00:55] the unbeliever you see if the unbeliever
[1:00:59] could care less
[1:01:01] would even curse you for mentioning god
[1:01:04] to him in that context they'll use god's
[1:01:06] name in any other way but you mention it
[1:01:07] to him in salvation
[1:01:09] and they'll curse you for it i've been
[1:01:11] there
[1:01:13] and the person that won't finish the
[1:01:15] race
[1:01:18] imagine imagine if we could force them
[1:01:22] to finish the race
[1:01:30] you'd just walk out in the church and
[1:01:31] you'd grab them by their caller and
[1:01:34] they'd be saying i don't want to and
[1:01:35] you'd be saying i don't care and you
[1:01:37] drag them kicking and screaming up front
[1:01:40] and then you would hold them at the
[1:01:41] altar for a prescribed time
[1:01:44] tick tick tick tick and then you would
[1:01:48] pull them from the altar and you would
[1:01:49] take them over here to the baptismal
[1:01:51] tank
[1:01:53] and maybe that's where you would get it
[1:01:54] done because you would hold them under
[1:01:56] for a prescribed time
[1:02:00] and when they came out they would be a
[1:02:03] good christian
[1:02:05] you imagine what church would look like
[1:02:07] we'd have about 10
[1:02:09] guys the size of brother ivan brother
[1:02:11] jason
[1:02:12] because there would be no one that would
[1:02:14] be free from our
[1:02:18] conversion and that does happen in
[1:02:20] certain places
[1:02:22] yeah sometimes it's mental
[1:02:25] emotional but those should be called
[1:02:28] abuse
[1:02:29] not conversions but you see the real
[1:02:32] truth of it is what happens is
[1:02:35] some things happen down in the soul and
[1:02:38] it's the soul that gets the body out of
[1:02:40] the chair
[1:02:41] it's not the mind it's not the
[1:02:43] intellectual
[1:02:44] understanding it's the soul that moves
[1:02:48] the person
[1:02:49] from the chair to the altar to the
[1:02:52] baptism
[1:02:53] to the infilling of the holy ghost it's
[1:02:56] something on the inside
[1:03:00] and so god totally removed man's ability
[1:03:02] now we can explain the gospels my
[1:03:04] brother and sister of what happened here
[1:03:06] and what happened there and why this
[1:03:07] happened we can do that
[1:03:09] but that will not change the soul that's
[1:03:11] why we have
[1:03:12] way too much intellectual understanding
[1:03:15] of the message of the word of god
[1:03:18] because somebody said now this is here
[1:03:20] and this is here and this is here
[1:03:22] i still have to laugh about this you
[1:03:24] know brother prashant
[1:03:25] i ask him brother prashan what are you
[1:03:27] working on now and he goes well
[1:03:31] i'm sorry brother paul
[1:03:36] i don't know any other way to explain it
[1:03:38] to you than to tell you
[1:03:40] this grain of sand has now been made
[1:03:43] more intelligent
[1:03:44] than you
[1:03:48] i get it brother i understand exactly
[1:03:50] what you said
[1:03:52] how can you take a piece of silica or
[1:03:54] whatever it is
[1:03:56] and you do these and somehow electrical
[1:03:59] charge
[1:04:00] and then it will now sorry i'll just
[1:04:02] stick with putting seeds in dirt
[1:04:04] and irrigating it and keeping the weeds
[1:04:06] out because that's a concept i
[1:04:08] understand and besides this i say this
[1:04:11] in good humor if brother prashant sister
[1:04:12] conch are listening today
[1:04:14] nowhere in the scripture do you find
[1:04:16] anything about taking pieces of sand and
[1:04:18] making it intelligent
[1:04:21] but you can find the farmer in scripture
[1:04:25] so i say that to make myself feel good
[1:04:27] because i don't have a clue what they're
[1:04:29] doing
[1:04:32] but you see we're not called with a
[1:04:34] natural calling that we explain how that
[1:04:36] this
[1:04:36] energized and this has now intelligence
[1:04:39] and has memory
[1:04:40] we're called with a supernatural calling
[1:04:42] and the supernatural calling my brother
[1:04:44] and sister god
[1:04:45] chose those that were poor and weak and
[1:04:48] unintelligent
[1:04:49] amen even so much that it was praised in
[1:04:52] the scripture
[1:04:53] lord thank you for hiding it from the
[1:04:56] wise
[1:04:57] and the prudent and revealing it to
[1:04:59] babes
[1:05:01] and i say thank you lord amen that he
[1:05:04] take this that we didn't have to have an
[1:05:06] intellectual understanding to grasp why
[1:05:09] it is that god chose you and i before
[1:05:11] the foundation of the world
[1:05:13] what we have to do is act upon the word
[1:05:15] that says he did
[1:05:17] and when the word says he already has
[1:05:20] done
[1:05:21] this work in you what we need to do
[1:05:24] is take and put that to action and say i
[1:05:27] believe
[1:05:29] i believe this work has already been
[1:05:31] begun in me
[1:05:32] and when the scripture says that he
[1:05:34] finishes everything that he starts
[1:05:36] we should be able to take and put that
[1:05:38] in action and say i
[1:05:40] am a finished work of god but but
[1:05:43] brother paul but brother so and so
[1:05:45] sister so and so
[1:05:46] you have this little issue and you have
[1:05:48] this little issue
[1:05:49] i don't care about how you see the issue
[1:05:52] i see the word of god that says i'm a
[1:05:55] finished work
[1:05:56] in jesus christ he says not only that
[1:05:59] that i am perfect in him
[1:06:01] and that i am righteous in him and i am
[1:06:03] holy in him
[1:06:04] i don't need to understand how that it
[1:06:08] happened
[1:06:08] i need to accept it and take the action
[1:06:12] and by taking the action i make it real
[1:06:14] in my life and then when i make it real
[1:06:16] in my life i start
[1:06:18] to apply it and as i apply it my life
[1:06:20] changes
[1:06:21] can someone say amen to that and so as
[1:06:24] our life changes we start to realize
[1:06:27] that our god is not a god that comes
[1:06:29] around every once in a while but he's an
[1:06:31] ever-present god who knows our every
[1:06:33] situation
[1:06:34] and cares enough to correct us
[1:06:43] have words i could share with you the
[1:06:45] words of a man i know concerning his
[1:06:47] children but i can't use a kind of
[1:06:48] language in the house of god
[1:06:50] but the man just turned his kids loose
[1:06:52] to become whatever they become
[1:06:54] because he said they were a child of and
[1:06:57] he used
[1:06:58] heaven
[1:07:02] now my brother and sister how could a
[1:07:04] man say that about his own children
[1:07:11] but yet those words would anoint his
[1:07:12] household
[1:07:17] have enough liberty with this man to
[1:07:19] look him in the face and say you know
[1:07:20] what you're just causing yourself more
[1:07:22] problems buddy
[1:07:24] you need to just stop saying that and
[1:07:26] you need to say my kids are going to
[1:07:27] grow
[1:07:28] up to be awesome adults productive and
[1:07:30] respectful and whatever and he's like
[1:07:32] why would i say that i said because what
[1:07:34] you say right here
[1:07:35] is what will come to pass in your
[1:07:37] children's life
[1:07:38] i think he believed i don't hear him say
[1:07:41] those words
[1:07:42] either that or he just doesn't say him
[1:07:43] in front of me but my brother and sister
[1:07:45] you see
[1:07:46] that's how it is the word says your body
[1:07:49] will obey your confession
[1:07:51] take action on that hallelujah i'm a son
[1:07:54] of god i'm a daughter of god
[1:07:56] i'm struggling i have things that look
[1:07:58] like worldly habits and worldly thoughts
[1:08:00] and worldly whatever
[1:08:01] i like to listen to worldly music but i
[1:08:03] believe i could be a son of god
[1:08:05] i believe i will be a son of god and
[1:08:07] you'll find that one day that music is
[1:08:10] distasteful
[1:08:10] that alcohol is distasteful that
[1:08:13] lifestyle is distasteful
[1:08:15] because your body is reacting
[1:08:18] to a supernatural call not an earthly
[1:08:22] call and don't confuse this to the works
[1:08:25] of a
[1:08:25] a a is good and those things that
[1:08:28] operate on the principles of a
[1:08:30] a where they speak these positive things
[1:08:32] that's good there's tens and thousands
[1:08:34] probably hundreds of thousands
[1:08:36] of of people that have been changed by
[1:08:39] that
[1:08:39] but i'm talking about my brother and
[1:08:41] sister the scripture says
[1:08:42] that we fight not against flesh and
[1:08:44] blood but against principalities
[1:08:47] and darkness the spirits of evil and
[1:08:50] evil kingdom
[1:08:51] and evil reinforcement of an evil idea
[1:08:54] you're not just talking about hey we're
[1:08:56] going to just change people
[1:08:58] got to be able to withstand the spirits
[1:09:00] of the day and we understand by the
[1:09:02] scripture that the spirits of laodicea
[1:09:04] are the spirits of all the ages have now
[1:09:08] come into a maturity
[1:09:10] in this time and my brother and sister
[1:09:12] many a man many a woman
[1:09:14] many a family through history has been
[1:09:16] derailed of the spirit of their day
[1:09:19] and you're here with a spirit of every
[1:09:21] age fighting against you
[1:09:23] why are you standing because there is
[1:09:25] something supernatural called
[1:09:27] in you that will lift you up because you
[1:09:29] recognize on
[1:09:30] fighting against the flesh and you can
[1:09:32] fight against your own flesh oh if i
[1:09:34] could just be
[1:09:35] if i could do that my father back in the
[1:09:38] days of korea
[1:09:39] i say he was blessed in the sense that
[1:09:41] the the united states navy
[1:09:43] said we you have an aptitude we're going
[1:09:45] to make you an airplane mechanic
[1:09:46] and ultimately they chose to send him to
[1:09:48] panama where they would fly the patrol
[1:09:51] planes over the ocean the float planes
[1:09:53] and because of that he got to fly to
[1:09:55] many different places
[1:09:56] my father i'm not speaking ill of this
[1:09:58] my brother and sister
[1:09:59] it's not the people but it's a spirit
[1:10:01] behind it but my father one time was
[1:10:03] chosen to be the flight engineer
[1:10:05] to fly to bogota colombia while
[1:10:07] diplomats were taking care of business
[1:10:10] and he was there they said now you don't
[1:10:12] go anywhere stay away from these areas
[1:10:14] but tour the city be back
[1:10:16] at a certain time and he got there my
[1:10:18] brother and sister and come to a
[1:10:19] catholic church
[1:10:20] that had multiple layers of stairs going
[1:10:23] up to the church
[1:10:24] and those stones were of rough cut rock
[1:10:26] and here were people
[1:10:28] who were climbing from one step to the
[1:10:30] next and as they are praying
[1:10:32] moving from one step to the next by the
[1:10:34] time they got a short distance their
[1:10:36] knees are bloody
[1:10:37] and they're now leaving a trail of blood
[1:10:40] behind them
[1:10:41] believing that is going to save them
[1:10:45] there's only one blood that would save
[1:10:48] us and it won't be the shedding of our
[1:10:50] blood
[1:10:51] it is his blood and so you see my
[1:10:53] brother and sister they're acting upon
[1:10:56] something that they were taught that
[1:10:58] says if you'll do this
[1:10:59] you'll find favor with god but my bible
[1:11:02] says
[1:11:03] that if we will live this word there's
[1:11:06] where we find favor with god
[1:11:08] it's not in our human action
[1:11:11] but it is obedience to the word of god
[1:11:14] we find favor with god
[1:11:16] amen so we could climb those stairs on
[1:11:18] our knees day after day
[1:11:20] until we were physically wrecked and
[1:11:22] couldn't even walk
[1:11:23] and that would not get us salvation
[1:11:26] but i tell you we can come and we apply
[1:11:28] this now i'm talking about how an
[1:11:30] activist
[1:11:31] can come and they would give such time
[1:11:34] and such effort
[1:11:35] days and nights weeks months and years
[1:11:37] to do this
[1:11:38] imagine if they would give that same
[1:11:41] kind of devotion
[1:11:43] to the gospel of jesus christ there's
[1:11:46] where you see a life-changing event
[1:11:48] taking place
[1:11:49] we can't change now i'm not going to get
[1:11:51] into politics but we can't change the
[1:11:53] politics of our current administration
[1:11:56] we cannot change the politics of the
[1:11:58] past administration
[1:12:00] or those through history my brother and
[1:12:02] sister one voice will not do that
[1:12:04] and they believe that multitudes of
[1:12:06] thousands of people coming together will
[1:12:07] do that
[1:12:08] but they burn down a city and say well
[1:12:10] they're just expressing their voice
[1:12:13] did it change anything no it sent a
[1:12:16] signal
[1:12:18] that evil is good and good
[1:12:21] is evil reinforcing exactly what the
[1:12:25] word of god said would happen for our
[1:12:26] day
[1:12:28] see when you're called with that
[1:12:29] supernatural calling my brother and
[1:12:31] sister it isn't that we give
[1:12:32] up on life or our nation but we
[1:12:34] recognize that there's another power
[1:12:36] uh powers that are battling out uh
[1:12:39] things that are happening
[1:12:40] and it comes there my brother and sister
[1:12:42] and when you're called with that
[1:12:44] supernatural calling
[1:12:45] it requires one's entire entire life
[1:12:51] otherwise we're a wednesday christian
[1:12:53] and easter christmas
[1:12:57] this celebration that celebration
[1:13:01] sometimes to make a fact it sounds like
[1:13:03] you're being judgmental and i
[1:13:05] i'm not truly i am not but this last
[1:13:08] easter there's a certain church down
[1:13:09] midland boulevard here
[1:13:11] the police allowed them to put
[1:13:13] barricades in the streets
[1:13:15] they allowed them to use the school
[1:13:16] parking lot
[1:13:18] because it was just literally
[1:13:21] packed out very next sunday
[1:13:26] we're right back to normal
[1:13:30] i don't want to be that kind of
[1:13:31] christian i want to have the holy spirit
[1:13:32] move on my life move on your life
[1:13:35] something supernatural happened you know
[1:13:38] that god spoke to you it wasn't some man
[1:13:40] behind a pulpit
[1:13:41] you know it was god speak to you and if
[1:13:43] we're not careful the spirit of the day
[1:13:45] will bring us back and next sunday we'll
[1:13:46] be right back
[1:13:47] where we was i want a life-changing
[1:13:50] gospel
[1:13:51] and when i hear a life-changing gospel i
[1:13:54] want to act upon that life-changing
[1:13:58] gospel
[1:14:00] reminds me of a story that was shared it
[1:14:02] was a first-hand story a personal story
[1:14:07] a man's grandfather
[1:14:11] was friends
[1:14:14] with a man so much so that sometimes he
[1:14:16] would go and help him work on his
[1:14:18] project and
[1:14:19] the man says you know i believe i can i
[1:14:21] believe i can take this idea that i've
[1:14:23] got
[1:14:24] and i believe i can sell it to the car
[1:14:26] makers and i i believe
[1:14:28] they'll i think they'll be interested in
[1:14:30] it but i need
[1:14:31] 500 more dollars and i i know that you
[1:14:34] have the 500
[1:14:35] would you please invest that with me so
[1:14:37] i can go forward and
[1:14:38] he looked at this and he says you know i
[1:14:40] just don't i don't believe in it i i've
[1:14:42] helped you i've saw it
[1:14:43] i've done this but i i don't i just know
[1:14:46] i'm not going to give you 500
[1:14:48] the man found another individual to help
[1:14:50] with the 500
[1:14:51] and he takes his idea i don't remember
[1:14:54] one of the car
[1:14:54] manufacturers it was he took the idea to
[1:14:57] first
[1:14:58] and they looked at that idea and they
[1:15:01] said
[1:15:01] we want in in less than five years that
[1:15:05] investor
[1:15:06] who had invested five hundred dollars
[1:15:08] had made one million dollars
[1:15:12] and this man says he's i know that story
[1:15:14] he says because
[1:15:16] my grandfather
[1:15:19] if it was great grandfather i'm not
[1:15:21] certain about that
[1:15:23] he said everyone in our family and now
[1:15:26] i've even caught the spirit
[1:15:27] we lament the fact
[1:15:30] they didn't see the vision of what the
[1:15:33] automatic transmission
[1:15:36] would be
[1:15:41] you see he had the opportunity to act
[1:15:43] upon it but in his mind there's just no
[1:15:46] way they're going to take
[1:15:47] this little thing because you see the
[1:15:48] automatic transmission of that day
[1:15:50] wasn't as it is today it was more
[1:15:54] of exposed discs and different
[1:15:57] bands and different things you know so
[1:15:59] it's very primitive in the sense
[1:16:01] but my brother and sister those of you
[1:16:02] that are old enough and maybe brother
[1:16:04] bob sister joanne might be the only ones
[1:16:06] that qualify
[1:16:07] to really have experience back in the
[1:16:08] day to see cars
[1:16:10] that had almost prehistoric automatic
[1:16:13] transmissions
[1:16:14] but my brother and sister you recognize
[1:16:17] that there was something there
[1:16:18] the man was given now my point is is to
[1:16:21] make to you that the opportunity
[1:16:23] is given but there's almost more reasons
[1:16:27] why not
[1:16:31] sell out to jesus christ
[1:16:35] well i should the devil comes
[1:16:39] some of the kids have their little
[1:16:40] notebooks but i'll just mimic this
[1:16:42] can i borrow your note sister sue the
[1:16:45] devil comes
[1:16:46] and he says but let me show you the
[1:16:48] reasons why not
[1:16:50] and he don't just have half a page he
[1:16:53] just keeps going
[1:16:54] and going and going he's got
[1:16:57] all kinds of reasons
[1:17:02] that's why the new birth is a
[1:17:04] supernatural event
[1:17:05] it's not a human event it's not an
[1:17:07] intellectual event it is not an action
[1:17:09] i'll go to church today and get the
[1:17:11] baptism of the holy ghost
[1:17:12] it is something that has to be in the
[1:17:14] inside of us
[1:17:15] inviting us invest invest
[1:17:19] invest in life here invest in eternal
[1:17:21] life
[1:17:22] move forward take claim to this but if
[1:17:24] we'll listen there'll be a lot of
[1:17:25] reasons why not
[1:17:27] well it turns out part of that story was
[1:17:29] is this uh this grandfather great
[1:17:31] grandfather whatever
[1:17:33] called up his father-in-law this is
[1:17:35] maybe why father-in-law's have a bad
[1:17:36] reputation i don't know but he called up
[1:17:38] his father-in-law and he said hey
[1:17:40] friend and he's got this idea and he
[1:17:42] needs five hundred dollars and he says
[1:17:44] you realize
[1:17:45] son with five hundred dollars you can do
[1:17:47] this and you can do that and you got a
[1:17:49] baby coming you can put an addition on
[1:17:51] your house and fix it all up for that
[1:17:52] baby and you can listen
[1:17:56] totally miss the idea that 500 could
[1:17:59] turn into
[1:18:00] 1 million
[1:18:06] but if he had a father-in-law i want to
[1:18:08] just throw in influence
[1:18:11] if he'd had a father that said you know
[1:18:13] what son
[1:18:15] if i was you you can work overtime
[1:18:19] you can mow yards you can dig ditch you
[1:18:22] can trim trees you can do this and make
[1:18:24] up this 500 dollars
[1:18:26] but that sounds like a pretty good idea
[1:18:29] i would risk it and i'll tell you what
[1:18:31] when the baby comes if this doesn't work
[1:18:33] out and the baby comes i'll
[1:18:34] i'll help build a dishing on your house
[1:18:36] for you for the baby
[1:18:38] see a different father-in-law different
[1:18:40] idea different concept
[1:18:41] different now i'm delving in the natural
[1:18:43] here but i think you can apply this over
[1:18:45] into the spiritual
[1:18:47] some people are like well i have a
[1:18:48] certain thing in my life brother paul
[1:18:51] and i struggle with it that's all right
[1:18:53] praise god anyhow
[1:18:55] amen you got things in your life that
[1:18:57] you'd be ashamed for it to become public
[1:18:59] come to church anyhow amen when you are
[1:19:02] sitting
[1:19:03] there don't be ashamed to say lord i
[1:19:06] behave
[1:19:06] this way this week lord forgive me
[1:19:10] amen and act on the word anyhow
[1:19:16] or we can sit back and say you know when
[1:19:18] my life is just right all
[1:19:21] i'll get saved
[1:19:24] well hallelujah you won't even bother
[1:19:26] looking at the finish line because you
[1:19:28] never started
[1:19:33] are we all right proverbs 16
[1:19:36] 25 amen this applies to all of us my
[1:19:40] brother and sister there is a way that
[1:19:42] seemeth rightened to a man
[1:19:43] but the end thereof are the ways of
[1:19:46] death
[1:19:47] see we can convince ourself right i kind
[1:19:49] of twist that little deal about being
[1:19:51] justified
[1:19:52] we can justify ourself i am justified to
[1:19:56] treat them like that because they did
[1:19:58] this to me
[1:19:59] 42 years ago i'm sorry my brother and
[1:20:02] sister the bitterness
[1:20:03] will eat you and they won't even
[1:20:05] understand why
[1:20:07] hallelujah
[1:20:11] well i won't face them or tell them they
[1:20:13] hurt my feelings because well it might
[1:20:15] cause a fight
[1:20:19] okay it might
[1:20:24] so the answer do you know i have the
[1:20:26] answer i found it in scripture
[1:20:30] i go to them they actually hurt me we're
[1:20:34] talking about not something for thought
[1:20:35] we're talking about legitimate they hurt
[1:20:37] me
[1:20:38] and if i go to them it's just going to
[1:20:40] cause problems so you know what i'm
[1:20:41] going to do to solve this
[1:20:44] i'm going to go apologize to them
[1:20:47] scriptural
[1:20:48] i'm going to say i am so sorry that i
[1:20:51] took what you said
[1:20:53] and i become bitter over that i couldn't
[1:20:56] do that brother paul
[1:20:58] i mean i i would look silly i mean i
[1:21:00] would
[1:21:01] well i'll tell you what i won't go into
[1:21:05] details on this
[1:21:07] sister jerry and i had a circumstance we
[1:21:09] went to some individuals
[1:21:11] and we said we are sorry
[1:21:15] what are you sorry about what is it
[1:21:17] you're apologizing you never even told
[1:21:18] us what the reason is what are you doing
[1:21:22] god bless you leave i died apart
[1:21:29] see now it's on them if they had been in
[1:21:32] the right spirit
[1:21:33] they'd have said i guess it doesn't
[1:21:35] really matter what you're apologizing
[1:21:36] about
[1:21:38] i accept it
[1:21:42] see if you come in the truth in this
[1:21:45] particular situation you come in the
[1:21:46] truth
[1:21:47] and you speak out what the actual truth
[1:21:49] behind it all is
[1:21:50] if they get that way from an apology
[1:21:53] imagine what they're going to do when
[1:21:55] you lay out the facts
[1:21:58] bent out of shape angry strident
[1:22:02] over an apology
[1:22:06] do your part apologize
[1:22:10] let go of it may not change them
[1:22:13] but it will change you hallelujah
[1:22:18] see you're taking action on the word
[1:22:21] of god now as it is the way that seemeth
[1:22:24] right
[1:22:25] to a man but the end thereof are the
[1:22:26] ways of death you see man's thinking
[1:22:28] man's approach
[1:22:29] man's way my brother and sister never
[1:22:32] ever
[1:22:32] ever fixes anything but you see god has
[1:22:36] a way of removing obstacles
[1:22:38] i'm telling you it's just utterly
[1:22:40] amazing
[1:22:42] god has a way of removing obstacles
[1:22:45] now look partial submission to the word
[1:22:49] at best gets you partial results
[1:22:55] come on i want somebody to say amen
[1:23:00] we need to acknowledge that is the truth
[1:23:02] a partial submission to the word
[1:23:04] only at best will give you partial
[1:23:06] results
[1:23:08] then people sit there and say well i
[1:23:09] went to church for 20 years and god
[1:23:11] never did nothing for me
[1:23:12] well i'm telling you what folks whoever
[1:23:14] you might be you
[1:23:15] never ever gave god yourself a hundred
[1:23:18] percent
[1:23:19] you gave god what you wanted to give god
[1:23:21] you gave it when you wanted to give it
[1:23:22] you gave it how you wanted to give it
[1:23:24] and you wanted god to come back and make
[1:23:26] you a millionaire as it were
[1:23:27] because of your limited effort
[1:23:31] hallelujah now look that's a that's a
[1:23:34] much deeper thing saints than than we
[1:23:36] would like to
[1:23:37] look at it's much deeper so if you want
[1:23:41] complete results you need a complete
[1:23:45] submission
[1:23:46] and a complete
[1:23:50] complete submission
[1:23:55] brother jason i think you left that
[1:23:56] spirit up here
[1:24:04] complete submission to the word
[1:24:08] brings a complete or fulfilled
[1:24:14] result
[1:24:16] see now look at this i i didn't uh
[1:24:19] i didn't give this to the brothers but
[1:24:21] it's in the token
[1:24:23] full obedience to the full word of god
[1:24:27] entitles us to the token
[1:24:30] no other way is there that you could
[1:24:32] ever be entitled to the token
[1:24:35] until you fully obey the word
[1:24:38] not what somebody has put into it or
[1:24:41] added to it
[1:24:42] but what god said about it
[1:24:45] you know that didn't solve a lot of
[1:24:46] problems in christians lives if they
[1:24:48] just simply looked at the bible and said
[1:24:50] okay i got no
[1:24:51] other alternative than to be obedient to
[1:24:55] this
[1:24:56] but you know what it is uh one one
[1:24:59] minister that i know calls it the church
[1:25:01] of the flavor
[1:25:06] i feel like shouting i'll go to this
[1:25:08] church i feel about feel sorry for
[1:25:10] myself i'll go to this church
[1:25:12] i want to go to the potluck i'll go to
[1:25:14] this church i want to do this i go to
[1:25:15] this
[1:25:16] church my children need friends i'll go
[1:25:18] to that church
[1:25:21] what do they have you realize my brother
[1:25:24] and sister that every one of these
[1:25:25] churches has everything that the other
[1:25:27] church has
[1:25:28] it's a matter of what they're willing to
[1:25:30] submit to
[1:25:31] so when they're not willing to submit to
[1:25:33] the preaching of the word they're not
[1:25:34] going to be around for the fellowship
[1:25:39] do i need to explain it further probably
[1:25:42] not
[1:25:43] so you see my brother and sister full
[1:25:46] obedience to the full word of god and
[1:25:48] entitles us to the token no other in an
[1:25:51] age of entitlement my brother and sister
[1:25:54] no other form will get you the full word
[1:25:57] of god
[1:25:58] other than full obedience to the word
[1:26:01] you know
[1:26:01] now let's look here real quick
[1:26:06] hebrews 12th chapter 24-29
[1:26:09] and to jesus the mediator of a new
[1:26:11] covenant and to the blood of sprinkling
[1:26:13] that speaketh better things than that of
[1:26:16] abel
[1:26:17] see that ye refuse not him that speaketh
[1:26:21] for if they escaped who refused him that
[1:26:24] spake on earth
[1:26:25] much more shall we not escape if we turn
[1:26:28] away
[1:26:28] from him that speaketh from heaven whose
[1:26:32] voice then shook the earth
[1:26:33] and now he hath promised saying yet once
[1:26:36] more i shake not the earth only but also
[1:26:39] heaven
[1:26:40] and this word yet once more signifieth
[1:26:43] the removing of those things that are
[1:26:46] shaken
[1:26:46] as of things that are made that those
[1:26:49] things which cannot be shaken
[1:26:51] may remain wherefore we received a
[1:26:54] kingdom which cannot be moved
[1:26:56] let us have grace whereby we may serve
[1:26:59] god
[1:27:00] acceptably with reverence and godly fear
[1:27:03] for our god is a consuming fire
[1:27:07] now we're looking my brother and sister
[1:27:09] that a time that i believe that hebrews
[1:27:11] 12 has come to pass
[1:27:12] that we are now seeing the shaking of
[1:27:14] heaven and earth
[1:27:15] we're now seeing that everything that
[1:27:18] can be shaken
[1:27:19] is being removed from the christian's
[1:27:21] life
[1:27:22] amen so when the christian life is now
[1:27:25] changed because things are disappearing
[1:27:29] is it always comfortable
[1:27:34] we joked the other day i have a temper
[1:27:36] because i'm irish
[1:27:41] go ahead put your weakness in there
[1:27:46] you might not be irish but you can have
[1:27:50] something that controls your life
[1:27:52] that you struggle with
[1:27:56] and god says no problem going to shake
[1:28:00] heaven
[1:28:01] and earth because if it can be removed
[1:28:05] from your
[1:28:07] i will remove it because the only thing
[1:28:11] that will not
[1:28:12] be moved is the word amen
[1:28:15] amen
[1:28:19] i come from this i come from that i this
[1:28:22] i that god don't care amen god
[1:28:26] does not care
[1:28:29] if it's a hindrance i'll just be bold
[1:28:33] enough to say this
[1:28:35] i've dealt with people that felt like
[1:28:37] they had a spiritual plateau over
[1:28:39] everyone else because they came from a
[1:28:40] certain church in a certain ministry
[1:28:44] but the truth of it was they had just as
[1:28:46] many
[1:28:47] little foxes in their vineyards
[1:28:50] as everyone else but in their mind they
[1:28:54] were more spiritual because of where
[1:28:56] they come from or what teaching they
[1:28:57] were under god don't care about that i'm
[1:29:00] sorry to tell you folks
[1:29:02] god don't care about that what god cares
[1:29:04] about
[1:29:05] as you get that little fox out of your
[1:29:08] vineyard
[1:29:10] i have dealt with people that their
[1:29:12] pastors have actually told them
[1:29:15] oh god understands don't worry about
[1:29:19] that little besetting sin
[1:29:22] come on my brother and sister
[1:29:26] that's not what this gospel is about
[1:29:29] it's about shaking those things that
[1:29:31] need shaken
[1:29:34] and you know what if you get shook
[1:29:37] by the word of god maybe we ought to act
[1:29:41] upon that and go home
[1:29:43] and get down serious and say lord the
[1:29:46] word shook
[1:29:47] something loose there i heard it
[1:29:48] rattling around lord
[1:29:51] remove it look we were flying over the
[1:29:55] bering sea in a uh i don't remember what
[1:29:58] that was it was a
[1:30:00] cherokee 310 or something like that or a
[1:30:03] baron or something i don't remember
[1:30:05] and i happen to be sitting there right
[1:30:06] on the on the wing and
[1:30:08] we're out over the ocean iceberg stuff
[1:30:10] floating around and
[1:30:12] i'm thinking you know even if you
[1:30:13] survived landing in that down there
[1:30:16] uh there's nowhere to go it's just cold
[1:30:18] water and ice
[1:30:20] and i'm looking out and pretty soon
[1:30:21] something catches my eye and i'm looking
[1:30:23] out and
[1:30:24] there's a door on the side of the engine
[1:30:25] of this airplane and it starts to shake
[1:30:29] and i lean over to tell jerry there's a
[1:30:31] door on the side of this engine here
[1:30:32] that's shaking i look back it's all gone
[1:30:38] i hope the mechanic that put that on was
[1:30:40] a little more efficient on everything
[1:30:42] else
[1:30:42] put on
[1:30:46] because my brother and sister i don't
[1:30:47] care what your looks are if it won't
[1:30:50] stand if it's shaken it will get tore
[1:30:54] loose
[1:30:55] i'm sure it was just a simple thing of a
[1:30:57] distraction right he put it on there
[1:30:59] somebody distracted him and never
[1:31:00] tightened the bolts
[1:31:04] at least that's what i convinced myself
[1:31:05] of
[1:31:11] the pilot said
[1:31:14] oh no big deal we've lost a lot of them
[1:31:22] and the pastor who made his church so
[1:31:24] happy so comfortable
[1:31:26] feeling so blessed we're all part of
[1:31:28] this great program
[1:31:29] will stand one day and say no problem
[1:31:31] we've lost a lot of them
[1:31:36] but the one that's lost he's not going
[1:31:39] to feel that way
[1:31:42] brother branham says you clench the nail
[1:31:47] that's why framers don't make good
[1:31:48] finished carpenters
[1:31:52] you see my brother and sister wherefore
[1:31:54] we receiving a kingdom
[1:31:56] cannot be moved let us have grace
[1:31:58] whereby we may
[1:32:00] serve god acceptably with reverence and
[1:32:02] godly fear
[1:32:04] let that be more of the motto of this
[1:32:06] church let that more be the motto of our
[1:32:08] lives
[1:32:09] then i will submit to the shaking
[1:32:12] see some people never know what will get
[1:32:14] shook loose because they'll never come
[1:32:16] they'll never submit themselves to the
[1:32:18] word of god to be shaken
[1:32:20] but i say a real son or daughter of god
[1:32:22] says lord you know what if there's
[1:32:23] something in my life
[1:32:25] lord i'm asking you i'm not going to cry
[1:32:27] when you do it but i'm asking you lord
[1:32:30] shake that loose in my life
[1:32:33] because i don't want at the moment of
[1:32:35] the finish line
[1:32:37] to realize that i've lost something that
[1:32:39] i needed
[1:32:40] because i didn't want god to shake me
[1:32:44] i didn't want to deal with it now look
[1:32:47] preachers can get complexes and i i
[1:32:49] don't mean to really go into this but
[1:32:51] it's just a fact
[1:32:52] you know people will be well you're
[1:32:54] you're too harsh
[1:32:55] you might wonder once sometimes i ask
[1:32:57] you guys you know am i okay i'm not
[1:32:58] offending anybody
[1:33:00] you know a little complex rises up there
[1:33:02] i don't want to hurt anybody
[1:33:03] but you see i realize if i don't tighten
[1:33:07] the bolts on the cowling on the airplane
[1:33:09] it's going to fall off and no one's
[1:33:12] going to go up to the bolt
[1:33:14] howling of the airplane and say now if i
[1:33:16] tighten you will you be offended
[1:33:20] so we're going to take the word and
[1:33:22] we're going to tighten it down nice and
[1:33:23] tight
[1:33:24] amen for we know it will stand the test
[1:33:26] of time we'll know it will stand the
[1:33:28] spirit of laodicea
[1:33:30] we know it will stand whatever might
[1:33:31] come our way
[1:33:34] and we won't be offended
[1:33:39] you see our action my brothers and
[1:33:41] sisters right here in philippians 3 14
[1:33:44] cherry picking this right out of the
[1:33:45] scriptures but i just want to make this
[1:33:46] point to you
[1:33:47] i see it's not we it's not them it's not
[1:33:50] someone else there's the make-believer
[1:33:53] spend his whole life going to church
[1:33:55] hearing the word preached
[1:33:59] but somehow it never changed
[1:34:02] never caused him to step beyond the line
[1:34:04] and look at himself
[1:34:08] hmm i think i'll leave that one alone
[1:34:12] you see what happens it comes down to a
[1:34:14] personal conviction it comes down to a
[1:34:16] personal action
[1:34:18] amen an action we're called to
[1:34:22] but we all have to respond to you know
[1:34:25] now look at this i want to just really
[1:34:27] go i've got a lot of highlighting in
[1:34:29] here
[1:34:30] and uh separation as it were to bring
[1:34:33] attention to but we'll just try
[1:34:35] now see go home
[1:34:38] read what's in front of it read what's
[1:34:40] behind it
[1:34:41] i don't think you'll find that it
[1:34:43] changes the context
[1:34:45] reasons no we're this no we're that no
[1:34:48] i'm sorry i'm a christian
[1:34:49] christian meaning christ-like that is my
[1:34:52] goal
[1:34:52] i don't want to be like a baptist i
[1:34:54] don't want to be like a methodist
[1:34:56] amen i don't want to be like lds see
[1:34:58] these are all things my family
[1:35:00] touched on in years way gone by my
[1:35:02] brother and sister
[1:35:03] i don't want to be like them i want to
[1:35:05] be like the god
[1:35:06] who wrote this bible amen i don't want
[1:35:09] to be because otherwise we'll find
[1:35:11] ourselves just conforming
[1:35:12] to a program that says if you believe
[1:35:15] this you will do this
[1:35:17] okay that's fine if it's the bible
[1:35:20] otherwise if it's just a book of creeds
[1:35:22] now some people think that we're caught
[1:35:23] up in that but the problem
[1:35:25] my brother and sister is those people
[1:35:27] want to take the same brush
[1:35:29] and paint everyone the same
[1:35:33] you all believe this so you must think
[1:35:35] like this
[1:35:36] well i'm sorry my brother and sister i
[1:35:38] firmly believe
[1:35:39] that the covenant the calling says to
[1:35:42] introduce
[1:35:43] us to jesus christ i believe it's
[1:35:45] happened
[1:35:46] hallelujah didn't introduce us to church
[1:35:49] introduce us to jesus christ
[1:35:51] hallelujah so
[1:35:56] now as then all true believers see him
[1:35:58] the word of promise of
[1:35:59] this day openly manifested
[1:36:04] see this is not just a writing there's
[1:36:06] not just a theory we're teaching
[1:36:08] the theory you can take college classes
[1:36:10] go to bible school go
[1:36:12] you know to seminary and and they have
[1:36:15] classes with titles such as
[1:36:17] the theory of
[1:36:24] no i want something openly manifested
[1:36:29] i'm going to stomp on your toes what
[1:36:32] reaction do i get
[1:36:38] let's have a line and see no i'm keeping
[1:36:43] you see my brother and sister we can't
[1:36:46] judge it that way because you realize
[1:36:48] there's days
[1:36:49] that spirits anoint us and we just
[1:36:53] overreact ah you're not a christian
[1:36:57] but the word of god says god looks on
[1:36:59] the heart amen
[1:37:01] so he looks down in the heart and says
[1:37:03] boy they had a rough day
[1:37:04] and the devil really really got them in
[1:37:06] a corner they kind of accepted they set
[1:37:08] themselves up for got them in the corner
[1:37:10] that's not who they are
[1:37:12] i know who they are because i have a
[1:37:14] clear vision of their heart
[1:37:15] amen but i'm telling you consistently
[1:37:19] year after year after year after year if
[1:37:21] you don't get rid of that temper
[1:37:22] something's wrong
[1:37:23] you don't get rid of that spirit of the
[1:37:25] world something's wrong
[1:37:27] right now the devil you know
[1:37:32] reminds me of a friend this is a couple
[1:37:33] years ago
[1:37:35] he said oh yeah you know paul uh i
[1:37:38] planned it i got
[1:37:38] got a sweet corn contract an open
[1:37:41] contract on a really good variety
[1:37:43] and uh and i said but i thought all your
[1:37:46] ground was filled up and he goes yeah
[1:37:48] i'm going to put it right down here by
[1:37:49] the lake i got a little spot down there
[1:37:51] and i said well i hope you harvest
[1:37:52] something and he goes what do you mean i
[1:37:54] says where there's one
[1:37:55] there's two
[1:37:58] and where there's two coons there's
[1:38:00] three where there's three coons there's
[1:38:02] four
[1:38:03] and i kept going until he's finally i
[1:38:05] got the idea
[1:38:07] you know his little seed corn plot
[1:38:12] looked like it had been ravaged by a
[1:38:14] tornado when it come harvest season
[1:38:19] my brother and sister did i get that
[1:38:22] point across
[1:38:24] where there's one spirit trying to
[1:38:26] defeat you there's a second
[1:38:28] and where there's two spirits trying to
[1:38:30] defeat you there'll be a third
[1:38:32] it's not just some easy i have a little
[1:38:34] problem with lying
[1:38:35] there'll be something else attached to
[1:38:37] that there'll be something else attached
[1:38:38] to that something else attached to that
[1:38:40] the devil where he gets his foot in the
[1:38:42] door
[1:38:43] has his minions there to push the door
[1:38:45] open
[1:38:47] amen so now
[1:38:51] the word of promise for this day openly
[1:38:53] manifested
[1:38:54] that's a big word if you can get it see
[1:38:58] manifested i've preached to people who
[1:39:01] have walked and looked me in the face
[1:39:02] and say
[1:39:03] we don't like you using the word
[1:39:05] manifested
[1:39:09] no because this message
[1:39:12] as a son or daughter of christ has to go
[1:39:14] beyond us just saying i'm a christian
[1:39:17] it's got to go beyond that it's got to
[1:39:20] be
[1:39:21] manifested
[1:39:25] but if nobody calls you on just the
[1:39:27] simple fact that you say i'm a christian
[1:39:28] i'm a believer
[1:39:30] you can go for years convincing yourself
[1:39:33] this is what happens my brother and
[1:39:34] sister to the make believer they're
[1:39:36] convinced
[1:39:38] they've got all they need
[1:39:42] so what we want to see is whether people
[1:39:44] like it or not we want to see this
[1:39:45] openly manifested all true believers
[1:39:48] that's in the word
[1:39:49] see god openly amen
[1:39:53] now look at this you cannot say that you
[1:39:56] are enlightened you know we live in a
[1:39:57] day with this well they call it woke
[1:40:02] such a new concept isn't it no
[1:40:07] no sons and daughters of god have been
[1:40:09] woke for generations
[1:40:11] they pick up their bible they read the
[1:40:14] word of god
[1:40:16] and it shows them something that other
[1:40:19] people say
[1:40:20] nonsense
[1:40:24] you read it again and say holiness
[1:40:33] now i don't recommend you do it but i
[1:40:36] get different ideas and i just have to
[1:40:37] follow them kind of like a bloodhound or
[1:40:39] something i guess
[1:40:41] but you come across articles out in the
[1:40:43] etherland
[1:40:46] things like a pastor writing an article
[1:40:49] saying why we are no longer holiness
[1:40:55] and he gave a very very balanced
[1:40:59] very balanced reason
[1:41:03] as the world has changed we
[1:41:06] need to be able to interact
[1:41:10] with them so if we come and our wives
[1:41:14] look like they're from 200 years ago
[1:41:18] and we come and we don't understand
[1:41:21] them how can we interact
[1:41:26] with them
[1:41:35] where's that train going
[1:41:38] hell it's full
[1:41:42] i guess i should go
[1:41:50] this bride of christ she's woke i never
[1:41:53] thought i'd use that term
[1:41:56] here let me pat myself on the back i'll
[1:41:58] never speak that word but this bride of
[1:42:00] christ she's woke
[1:42:01] amen hallelujah true believer that's in
[1:42:05] the word
[1:42:06] see god openly the veil is rent and god
[1:42:09] stands
[1:42:09] openly before you just because you say
[1:42:13] message message message doesn't mean
[1:42:15] it's open
[1:42:16] to you or to them or however you want to
[1:42:20] put it
[1:42:21] amen so if the veil is rent god stands
[1:42:24] openly before you manifest it
[1:42:26] see god didn't leave it as theory to you
[1:42:30] god left his word as reality it
[1:42:33] is true we can sit here today and say
[1:42:36] our god is a prayer answering god
[1:42:38] he is a healer he is a provider he said
[1:42:42] he would give me a sound mind
[1:42:44] and a clean heart
[1:42:48] at least that's the theory
[1:42:51] no sorry god stands only before you
[1:42:55] manifest to see god manifested
[1:42:57] open in order to do this our old
[1:43:01] denomination
[1:43:02] traditional veil must be rent again
[1:43:06] in order to see what it is you've got to
[1:43:08] come out from among that stuff see
[1:43:10] you'll never do it they'll keep pulling
[1:43:12] that veil before you every time
[1:43:14] oh there is nothing to that
[1:43:17] but here it is written and here it is
[1:43:19] made manifest you see
[1:43:21] he's used the word manifest a lot here
[1:43:23] in just this short distance
[1:43:25] but i don't think that's what he meant
[1:43:29] because we're going to take seminary 101
[1:43:33] theory come on my brother and sister
[1:43:36] theory
[1:43:37] never works
[1:43:41] pardon me for putting it this way but
[1:43:42] you know i get a few different industry
[1:43:44] magazines and
[1:43:44] they're in there and and for the season
[1:43:46] that's coming there's always articles
[1:43:48] about you know
[1:43:49] those things and you know i read these
[1:43:52] articles and i'm astounded
[1:43:54] men with masters women with master's
[1:43:56] degrees phd's etc
[1:43:58] and they're like if you want to grow
[1:44:02] good alfalfa
[1:44:06] you have to harvest it at the right time
[1:44:18] i don't know who they write the articles
[1:44:19] to but they're not writing it to
[1:44:20] somebody who's been raising alfalfa
[1:44:22] their whole life
[1:44:24] right and it's dependable different
[1:44:27] authors same article every year
[1:44:29] i made a comment to my wife here a while
[1:44:31] back just waiting for this
[1:44:32] deal so i can read it so i'll know how
[1:44:34] to grow hay this year
[1:44:37] but my brother and sister you look at
[1:44:39] this see
[1:44:41] in order to do this our old
[1:44:43] denominational traditional veil
[1:44:46] it was already rent it's got to be rent
[1:44:49] again
[1:44:51] now you say but we're not in
[1:44:52] denomination we're not denominational
[1:44:55] i do embrace this saints let me just
[1:44:56] share this with you i no longer identify
[1:44:59] as a non-denominational i actually
[1:45:03] have a denomination which is
[1:45:06] something that you adhere to follow the
[1:45:09] teachings of
[1:45:11] it's called jesus christ
[1:45:17] yeah he is my lord he's my savior he's
[1:45:20] my teacher
[1:45:21] all good things come from him everything
[1:45:24] is provided by him
[1:45:25] that's who i follow that's where i
[1:45:28] belong
[1:45:31] you've got to come out from that stuff
[1:45:33] see you'll never do it
[1:45:35] they'll keep pulling that veil before
[1:45:36] you every time now look i i debated and
[1:45:39] i struggled whether
[1:45:40] ahead and say these words because in a
[1:45:41] way it's not applicable to us
[1:45:43] but i'm just going to go ahead and say
[1:45:45] it saints
[1:45:46] there's someone trying to drag that old
[1:45:49] denominational spirit
[1:45:51] that old denominational veil they're
[1:45:52] trying to drag it in front of us
[1:45:55] they keep saying this is how you got to
[1:45:57] do it this is how you got to serve god
[1:45:59] in the auspice of the message
[1:46:00] this is what you got to do right here
[1:46:02] and they're pulling in a front but i'm
[1:46:03] telling you what the word of god says
[1:46:05] and the prophet of god goes on to say it
[1:46:07] right here in just a minute
[1:46:08] is there is a sword called the word the
[1:46:10] holy spirit that keeps coming and
[1:46:12] slashing all of these veils that people
[1:46:14] keep putting up
[1:46:16] hallelujah yeah you'll never do it
[1:46:19] they'll keep pulling that veil before
[1:46:21] you every time oh there is nothing to
[1:46:22] that but here it is written
[1:46:24] here it is made manifest you see now
[1:46:26] what if a fellow refuses to see the sun
[1:46:28] say oh there i know god said let there
[1:46:30] be light but there's no such thing i'm
[1:46:31] going down in the basement
[1:46:33] i just refuse to see it the guy is crazy
[1:46:36] there's something wrong with him there's
[1:46:38] something wrong with a man or a woman
[1:46:40] can see the promise of god see it
[1:46:43] manifest and then refuse to believe it
[1:46:45] because the denomination pulls the veil
[1:46:48] down see veil
[1:46:49] now i'll tell you right just i i don't
[1:46:52] mean to be rude
[1:46:53] i certainly don't but my brother and
[1:46:55] sister my bible says
[1:46:57] get up and go to church my bible doesn't
[1:46:59] say stay home
[1:47:02] but there's a whole movement that says
[1:47:04] don't trust the preacher he'll cause you
[1:47:06] problems
[1:47:06] stay home you're better off home than
[1:47:08] you are in church
[1:47:09] my bible says go find it my prophet says
[1:47:12] go find a holy ghost filled church find
[1:47:15] a good solid pastor
[1:47:16] amen and if you don't have a good solid
[1:47:18] pastor search till you find one
[1:47:20] amen and go to the house of god because
[1:47:23] it's by the preaching of the word that
[1:47:25] we are perfected
[1:47:27] and so it's there we have this great
[1:47:29] conflict of the day and my heart breaks
[1:47:30] because i have people that i consider to
[1:47:32] be dear friends to me
[1:47:33] would vehemently disagree with me but
[1:47:37] i'm going to stick with the bible
[1:47:39] and nowhere in the bible have i found
[1:47:41] yet
[1:47:43] i see where he put it in go to church i
[1:47:46] haven't seen where he said take it out
[1:47:50] i don't want that to offend anyone on
[1:47:52] that but you see we're coming down to
[1:47:54] this little
[1:47:55] little behaviors little things little
[1:47:57] things
[1:47:59] amen and mass refuse to believe
[1:48:03] because denomination pulls a veil down
[1:48:05] see veil in order to do this our
[1:48:07] denomination traditional veils must be
[1:48:10] broke
[1:48:10] by god's spirit of fire and sword which
[1:48:13] is his word
[1:48:15] okay if it's going to be the word that
[1:48:16] breaks that then it must be
[1:48:18] in the word already always his word
[1:48:21] is his sword see he took his sword for
[1:48:24] that
[1:48:25] fire ripped that veil from top to bottom
[1:48:27] he does the same thing with the same
[1:48:29] sword today
[1:48:30] not my creed my book of creeds my
[1:48:32] catechism but the sword of the lord see
[1:48:35] rips the veil down
[1:48:36] you see god standing in plain view
[1:48:39] manifested
[1:48:40] in his word what a glorious view to look
[1:48:43] at
[1:48:43] see all right god's holy spirit and fire
[1:48:46] his sword rips it
[1:48:48] the word rips the denominational veil
[1:48:56] my that's pretty rough stuff my brother
[1:48:59] and sister
[1:49:00] we live in a day that people will almost
[1:49:02] fight you over that
[1:49:04] but i'm sorry i'm going to take those
[1:49:07] same words that said
[1:49:08] stick with your bible
[1:49:13] hallelujah aren't you glad there's
[1:49:14] something that'll come along
[1:49:17] we get a little veil we get little ideas
[1:49:20] we
[1:49:20] little things blurs our vision aren't
[1:49:22] you glad that sword comes
[1:49:26] rips that thing opens it wide open we
[1:49:29] realize
[1:49:29] just a second okay i wasn't looking at
[1:49:32] that right
[1:49:33] because you see every man's right in his
[1:49:35] own eyes
[1:49:38] now look we live in a world as i close
[1:49:40] here
[1:49:42] we live in a world my brother and sister
[1:49:43] that the bible spoke of what was going
[1:49:45] to happen in our day
[1:49:47] right the bible did we don't have to go
[1:49:51] on tv we don't have to go on somewhere
[1:49:52] else and
[1:49:53] listen to this prophecy and listen to
[1:49:54] that prophecy now i don't encourage you
[1:49:57] to do this but i i will be honest and
[1:49:59] acknowledge you that sometimes as i said
[1:50:02] in pursuit of ideas i go and study this
[1:50:04] and so you know i was recently looking
[1:50:06] there in etherland
[1:50:08] uh about prophecies and it's interesting
[1:50:11] what the idea of prophecies are and some
[1:50:13] people's idea of prophecies
[1:50:15] uh you know will be like this one man
[1:50:16] has quite a following not just
[1:50:18] tremendous following
[1:50:19] but his prophecy was go ye therefore
[1:50:22] consuming the word of god overcoming by
[1:50:25] the fire
[1:50:27] of god's word
[1:50:32] it's what we do every day buddy and i'm
[1:50:35] not making light of this but i'm sorry
[1:50:37] that's not
[1:50:38] prophecy in fact looking at you know
[1:50:42] the behaviors and the attitudes and the
[1:50:44] whole drama behind it i'm
[1:50:46] i'm wondering if he's following his own
[1:50:48] advice
[1:50:50] my brother and sister the sure word of
[1:50:53] prophecy
[1:50:55] in our hour has come
[1:50:59] in the magnification of the word of god
[1:51:05] what we need to overcome in this hour
[1:51:09] is already in this word
[1:51:12] what we need to do is pray for the
[1:51:14] revelation that the word
[1:51:16] would be manifested from us
[1:51:20] let the word come to life amen i'm not
[1:51:23] against the spirit of prophecy don't
[1:51:25] misunderstand me
[1:51:26] but my brother and sister in an age when
[1:51:28] satan would take and twist that thing
[1:51:30] and pervert it
[1:51:30] and people then follow that oh i've got
[1:51:32] gotta i've gotta dig into this thing i
[1:51:34] gotta dig into that thing
[1:51:36] it's too long a story to really to share
[1:51:38] but uh we used to rent some farmland
[1:51:40] from
[1:51:40] from these people and the missus uh
[1:51:43] seemed like a very nice lady but um you
[1:51:46] know we dealt with her where when she
[1:51:48] bought the land we were already farming
[1:51:50] it
[1:51:50] they bought the land we were already
[1:51:51] farming it then uh
[1:51:53] we dealt with them for quite a long time
[1:51:55] just over the telephone and then they
[1:51:56] moved here
[1:51:57] and so then i got to meet this lady face
[1:52:00] to face
[1:52:01] now my brother and sister
[1:52:06] how do i say this
[1:52:11] i enjoyed talking with this lady talk
[1:52:14] spiritual things
[1:52:17] one day she says well why don't you meet
[1:52:19] my family and and pay your rent in
[1:52:20] person and i said okay i'll do that
[1:52:22] they lived just a few miles they'd move
[1:52:24] just a few miles from us
[1:52:25] i went to their house they opened the
[1:52:27] door things and
[1:52:28] and they are coming to pass and
[1:52:30] therefore they're gathering a following
[1:52:34] but i want you to
[1:52:37] find the right words to say this i want
[1:52:40] you to come
[1:52:42] and look at this real quick here
[1:52:45] when prophecies
[1:52:48] would seemingly be out of season a
[1:52:51] prophecy
[1:52:52] would come when
[1:52:55] there's no other patterns around to fit
[1:52:58] it
[1:52:59] it's one thing for me i could go out
[1:53:01] tomorrow and i could prophesy
[1:53:03] and say thus saith the lord the day will
[1:53:06] come
[1:53:07] when all of these denominations will
[1:53:09] fall back together
[1:53:11] because the scripture says their
[1:53:13] daughters
[1:53:14] and we can do a spiritual or natural
[1:53:17] dna and we can test the dna of the
[1:53:22] daughters
[1:53:23] and identify the mother
[1:53:28] would that really be a prophecy i'm
[1:53:30] prophesying i could be speaking truth
[1:53:32] thus saith the lord we're going to see
[1:53:34] the day when the daughters rising up are
[1:53:36] identified in their mother
[1:53:38] and everything i'd say would be the
[1:53:40] truth but you see
[1:53:42] because we've been made known
[1:53:45] [Music]
[1:53:47] can i use it one more time in the
[1:53:48] service today we're woke
[1:53:50] [Music]
[1:53:52] we see what the word says but look at
[1:53:54] this
[1:53:56] look at this right here look at the date
[1:54:00] 19 and 54. right in the era
[1:54:05] of mccarthyism and all these other
[1:54:07] things communists we've got to protect
[1:54:09] against it
[1:54:10] it seemed totally out of order
[1:54:14] no great thing but out of order to what
[1:54:16] what is going on
[1:54:17] but i want you to look at these words
[1:54:21] satan might have went out of fashion but
[1:54:23] he's not out of business
[1:54:25] he's still on the job brother the thing
[1:54:28] it is
[1:54:28] you just let these little old things
[1:54:30] creep in
[1:54:32] creep in creep in
[1:54:36] you think he wanted us to know he's
[1:54:37] thinking about it creeping in
[1:54:40] till the devil has blinded the eyes of
[1:54:42] the american people
[1:54:44] and communism has swept every church
[1:54:48] every school and everything else yes sir
[1:54:51] that's true now you say brother paul
[1:54:53] what is that
[1:54:54] well in my digging following it a
[1:54:57] thought
[1:54:58] a man you would recognize his name known
[1:55:02] through politics etc in the united
[1:55:03] states
[1:55:04] has a reputation nobody's managed to
[1:55:06] tarnish it yet
[1:55:09] and he said i looked
[1:55:13] at what the variation of communism is
[1:55:19] and he said i acknowledge
[1:55:22] it has taken over our government it's
[1:55:25] taken over our universities
[1:55:28] it's taken over our high schools he said
[1:55:31] in fact
[1:55:32] it has taken over our nation
[1:55:36] and it struck me i thought my
[1:55:39] oh my you know the kind of communism he
[1:55:42] was talking about
[1:55:44] not a red star in a nuclear device
[1:55:48] this undermining socialistic
[1:55:52] we're going to take from the rich and
