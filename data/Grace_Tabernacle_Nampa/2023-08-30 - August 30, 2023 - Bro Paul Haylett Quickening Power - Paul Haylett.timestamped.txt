[43:16] slowly building this bride up it's not a
[43:20] just a magical thing that goes poof and
[43:23] we're ready for a Rapture but can we
[43:26] honestly from our hearts tonight say God
[43:28] is building us amen and I look and as
[43:33] the uh colored sister was you know
[43:36] praise God I'm not what I used to be and
[43:40] and that really makes my heart Rejoice
[43:42] that we're not just stagnant we're not
[43:45] sitting here just hoping but God is
[43:48] doing a work and while sometimes we get
[43:51] discouraged in our own self
[43:53] realize God's the one in control amen
[43:56] he's the one that's setting the
[43:58] timepiece he's setting the pattern
[44:00] ye also as Lively stones are built up a
[44:04] spiritual house a holy priesthood to
[44:07] offer up spiritual sacrifices so if the
[44:10] devil ever comes and starts to beat up
[44:13] on you remember God's called you not to
[44:17] offer up your feelings your emotion your
[44:19] circumstance but to offer up a spiritual
[44:22] sacrifice
[44:24] that can be hard sometimes my brother
[44:26] and sister we get a little lonely we get
[44:28] a little discouraged the things we face
[44:30] and and the Devil comes in and starts to
[44:33] holler and make his noise and we think
[44:36] now I I know I'm speaking to real
[44:39] Believers tonight and we get to the
[44:41] place that we would actually tell
[44:42] ourselves I have nothing to offer God
[44:46] but this scripture declares otherwise
[44:49] whether we feel like it whether we think
[44:52] it's true or not he said that we were
[44:54] called up to offer spiritual sacrifice
[44:57] so I tell you remember this scripture
[45:00] and just hand it to the devil amen and
[45:02] tell them I'm sorry you've missed the
[45:04] boss you've missed the memo you weren't
[45:06] there when it happened I was God called
[45:09] me to offer up a spiritual sacrifice
[45:12] amen acceptable to God by Jesus Christ
[45:15] and I want to just go ahead and move on
[45:18] down the chapter as we have these last
[45:19] few Wednesdays but you are a chosen
[45:22] generation a royal priesthood a holy
[45:25] nation A peculiar people that ye should
[45:28] sow forth the Praises of him who hath
[45:31] called you out of Darkness Into His
[45:33] Marvelous Light which in time passed so
[45:36] my brother and sister this is telling
[45:38] you this is a present tense scripture
[45:40] right now tonight amen which in time
[45:44] past were not a people but are now the
[45:47] people of God which had not obtained
[45:49] Mercy but now have obtained Mercy have
[45:53] we obtained Mercy tonight amen I stand
[45:56] with confidence tonight knowing I have
[45:59] obtained Mercy amen Heavenly Father Lord
[46:02] we just come tonight Lord such a lovely
[46:05] atmosphere and I thank you Father it was
[46:07] my prayer today Lord and I don't believe
[46:09] just my prayer but the prayer of the
[46:11] Saints Lord that you would just come
[46:13] tonight and speak to us and Lord just
[46:16] strengthen us build us up Lord that when
[46:18] we leave tonight Lord we would truly be
[46:21] able to say from our hearts it was good
[46:23] and not good but great to be in the
[46:25] house of God Lord we thank you for your
[46:28] grace and your mercy we thank you for
[46:30] guidance we thank you for love Lord we
[46:33] also thank you for the word tonight in
[46:36] your name amen you may be seated Saints
[46:39] amen you know as we look at this and and
[46:43] um there's just times my brother and
[46:45] sister that I myself personally not to
[46:47] make emphasis on a personal level but
[46:49] there's times that I just uh read a
[46:51] scripture and every time I read it I
[46:54] might be reading it over and over and
[46:56] over again but every time I read it it
[46:59] seems as though it speaks to me in a
[47:01] fashion it speaks to me in a way that I
[47:04] had not thought about or I needed that
[47:06] little bit of encouragement at the
[47:08] moment and and God is so faithful that
[47:11] way to to just let his word be a Living
[47:14] Word to us can we say Amen it's a Living
[47:16] Word it's not a word that we read in a
[47:19] historical fashion and I enjoy these
[47:22] words of Peter that he's speaking to the
[47:24] church because they're definitely
[47:25] positive words words of affirmation and
[47:29] you know as uh you know I forget what
[47:31] the name of that book was a certain uh
[47:34] I'll what was that thing that
[47:37] you know the one that has the different
[47:39] types and one of those is affirmation I
[47:41] forgot what they call that book
[47:43] yeah yeah so you know you look at that
[47:46] and realize that you know in in a
[47:49] something like that they would write and
[47:50] say okay now your personality would be
[47:52] such that you are a person than
[47:54] affirmation but I'm here to tell you
[47:56] tonight every one of us is a person that
[47:58] desires affirmation amen we're here as
[48:01] Sons and Daughters of God God designed
[48:04] us to desire not encouragement of the
[48:07] word that continually lifts us up builds
[48:11] us up and you know sometimes we we come
[48:14] in a little state of life and and we
[48:16] just simply need a word of affirmation
[48:19] and uh you know if you raise your
[48:21] children without any words of
[48:23] affirmation you'll have children that if
[48:26] they have any self-confidence it will
[48:27] certainly come from somewhere but not
[48:30] you and so we are called as parents to
[48:33] give words of affirmation strengthening
[48:36] amen but I love Paul's words to the
[48:38] church because the emphasis here is upon
[48:42] the overcome summer even though the word
[48:44] Overcomer is not in these verses right
[48:47] here my brother and sister he's talking
[48:49] about the Overcomer he's speaking to
[48:52] those that have looked at the word of
[48:54] God Amen can we say the word is a good
[48:57] word amen the word is an encouraging
[48:59] word the word lifts us up and so the
[49:03] emphasis is to the Overcomer and we
[49:06] realize these words uh won't mean near
[49:09] as much to the make-believer
[49:11] my brother and sister now the prophet of
[49:14] God spoke about three kinds of Believers
[49:16] and we recognized in the whole context
[49:19] over all of the church but my brother
[49:21] and sister we sit here tonight and I
[49:23] believe I'm speaking to Believers amen
[49:25] and uh do you feel the same way yeah
[49:31] if any of you don't um
[49:33] well anyway
[49:35] but we're we're speaking to Believers
[49:37] we're speaking to Overcomers and the
[49:40] word is here in our midst to build us up
[49:43] to give us words of affirmation that
[49:45] builds our confidence and our trust amen
[49:48] you see Satan has worked for all these
[49:52] thousands of years to undermine
[49:54] Humanity's trust in the word of God and
[49:57] he he's done such efficient job that
[50:00] you'll have certain polls there are
[50:03] certain religious uh pollsters that that
[50:05] you know uh uh go and and they're kind
[50:08] of check the pulse of modern day
[50:10] Christianity and you know when you have
[50:13] polls that come back that show a very
[50:15] high percentage of Christians don't read
[50:17] their Bible
[50:19] a very high percentage of Christians
[50:22] don't believe in Divine Healing a very
[50:24] high percentage of Christians don't
[50:27] believe in the indwelling of the Holy
[50:29] Spirit
[50:30] Now isn't this a paradox that everything
[50:33] that makes Christianity that's a part of
[50:36] that's part of the foundation of but
[50:39] that's how well Satan has undermined it
[50:41] we can have the identity of Christian
[50:43] with no faith in God no trust in God at
[50:46] all no expectation from God
[50:49] I'm here tonight with great expectation
[50:52] amen you know I don't like to talk about
[50:54] it but you know I have blood sugar issue
[50:57] I don't claim that but I'm telling you
[50:59] with full expectation I believe I am
[51:02] healed in the name of Jesus Christ I
[51:05] don't care what the lying vanity or
[51:07] symptom says I believe the word of God
[51:10] and if the time would Terry and brother
[51:12] Paul passed away still with blood sugar
[51:15] issues my brother and sister that
[51:17] doesn't change my fact I believe my God
[51:20] Is My Healer
[51:23] and while I still have personal traits
[51:25] in my natural life that I am working to
[51:28] overcome I believe he has delivered me
[51:31] amen I'm not sitting here saying woe is
[51:34] me but I'm standing you hear a man
[51:36] that's been delivered because the word
[51:39] of God says so and I trust that word
[51:43] amen so it's there these won't mean much
[51:46] to the make-believer and will be almost
[51:48] nothing to the unbeliever
[51:51] amen I always Marvel at the wisdom as
[51:54] brother Branham speaks and the man says
[51:56] well you know I don't believe that and
[51:58] brother Branham doesn't cut the man down
[52:00] but he just speaks these words that's
[52:02] okay because it's not for unbelievers
[52:07] so we're going to see here tonight by
[52:09] God's grace what God is doing as he's
[52:12] building up this spiritual house he's
[52:14] building such a broad Foundation my
[52:17] brother and sister we don't have to
[52:18] build a house that is some little skinny
[52:21] thing some little just little postage
[52:23] stamp of a house that God is building a
[52:26] broad foundation of the word that we can
[52:29] as Sons and Daughters of God live fully
[52:32] the promise of God Amen that means if
[52:34] you want to add on to your living room
[52:36] you go this way and God's got a
[52:39] foundation for you you want to add on to
[52:41] the kitchen or make a sun room in a
[52:43] spiritual sense if you know what I'm
[52:45] saying you can go right out there and
[52:47] add on and God's got a foundation there
[52:49] for you we don't have to move off the
[52:51] foundation of the word to fulfill those
[52:54] things that are in the natural desires
[52:56] of our Lives can you say Amen to that
[52:58] amen when I say natural desires I'm
[53:01] talking about you know if you want to be
[53:03] the one that flies the airplane that's
[53:04] great if you want to be the one that
[53:06] jumps out of it that's that's great also
[53:08] amen I wouldn't mind jumping out of an
[53:10] airplane as long as it's sitting on the
[53:11] ground
[53:15] but you see what it's doing
[53:18] you sit here tonight my brother and
[53:20] sister identified as Victorious
[53:24] we're not identified in the word as as a
[53:27] defeated people not identified in the
[53:30] word as a husband or a might be but we
[53:34] are identified tonight in the word of
[53:36] God as a Victorious people in other
[53:39] words one that has already take
[53:41] possession of the promise of God and
[53:44] watching it being fulfilled in their
[53:46] life it's one thing my brother and
[53:48] sister you can take a Barney pole and uh
[53:51] Barney or pull and they talk about well
[53:53] Christians say this Christians say that
[53:55] my brother and sister I want to see what
[53:58] Christians are doing I don't want to
[54:00] hear about what they say they're going
[54:02] to do my do should do have done in the
[54:05] past but look at the life that's
[54:07] happening and you say oh brother Paul I
[54:09] don't know there's some things well
[54:11] we'll we'll address that in just a
[54:13] minute okay but look at this here we're
[54:16] identified tonight as a Victorious
[54:18] people can we can we come in unity
[54:21] tonight and claim that we are a
[54:23] Victorious People in Jesus Christ amen
[54:27] now the devil's going to say but you did
[54:28] this and you did not that's got nothing
[54:30] to do with it my brother and sister not
[54:32] one thing to do with it amen so it's
[54:36] there amen we're Victorious People
[54:40] and we're here as a people
[54:42] with revelation
[54:44] amen now there are so many things that I
[54:46] was going to add in and I took back out
[54:48] because I don't want to keep you here
[54:49] all night but my brother and sister are
[54:52] the prophet of God one declared of all
[54:54] the things that we as Believers should
[54:56] pray for Revelation would be one of them
[54:57] I want to ask you does God answer your
[55:00] prayer amen has God opened the word to
[55:03] you is God speaking to you are you being
[55:06] enlightened is the word being quickened
[55:09] to you
[55:10] amen so what do we have we have the word
[55:13] being fulfilled tonight prayers being
[55:15] answered tonight because we're not
[55:16] sitting here tonight saying well let me
[55:19] go check and see what this theological
[55:20] idea is let me go see what this Seminary
[55:23] says but we're here my brother and
[55:26] sister with a point of view What God
[55:28] Says is good enough
[55:31] Hallelujah amen I'm going to lift my
[55:34] hand and say thank you Lord that I could
[55:37] read between the lines amen this is not
[55:40] a cliche my brother and sister I don't
[55:41] represent it as a cliche but it is the
[55:45] revelation of Jesus Christ that allows
[55:48] you to look between the line and see
[55:50] what the world does not see
[55:52] sister Jerry showed me a little clip the
[55:55] other night and it was there that This
[55:57] Woman's explaining something about uh
[55:59] being a Christian and all of these
[56:01] things and she looks so ungodly I'm not
[56:05] being judgmental I'm being factual so
[56:07] ungodly explaining the scripture
[56:12] I'm sorry apply it first
[56:16] and then preach it to me
[56:19] I don't care who we are
[56:21] apply it first
[56:23] here take this pill no one's ever taken
[56:26] it and if you get well
[56:29] no take it yourself
[56:32] I'm sorry I'll deviate for just a moment
[56:34] but some gentleman very rich
[56:36] multi-billionaire man from Germany is
[56:39] talking about how there's too many
[56:40] humans on the earth and we need to get
[56:42] rid of some of them if he really believe
[56:44] that why would he start with himself
[56:49] hmm
[56:50] no he's not another interpretation of
[56:52] that
[56:53] that's like the preacher amen telling
[56:56] you how to live
[56:57] and you can't see the evidence God help
[57:00] us
[57:01] right that's straightforward boy that
[57:03] just skinned the height off of me didn't
[57:05] it
[57:06] amen I won't elaborate all I'll
[57:09] embarrass myself again
[57:11] Amen in the rising of the Sun
[57:14] just wanted to get into our thought here
[57:16] and one day when I was weary hmm
[57:19] brother Brown was weary myself and I
[57:22] said if you boy you'd better go ahead
[57:24] you're 50 years old if you're going to
[57:26] do anything for the Lord you better
[57:28] hurry up and do it you're getting old
[57:31] my 50 years old brother didn't feel like
[57:33] he had done a single thing and we sat
[57:35] here tonight whatever our age might be
[57:37] and say I just don't feel like I'm doing
[57:39] anything for the Lord here's a prophet
[57:41] that has seen the Supernatural
[57:43] manifested and unfolded before the
[57:46] people and he's saying I don't my
[57:49] brother and sister he wasn't being uh
[57:51] what would you what was the right word
[57:52] he wasn't you know kind of cutting down
[57:54] on himself for sympathy or anything like
[57:56] that I believe he's speaking from his
[57:58] heart that that's the very nature of a
[58:00] real Christian is I want to do more for
[58:02] the Lord I need to do more I want to
[58:04] live a better life I want to be a better
[58:06] example
[58:07] amen it's a desire God's put in us
[58:10] because imagine
[58:12] if we had a different attitude well I
[58:15] have done so much
[58:17] let's see I think we find him in
[58:19] Scripture
[58:20] even though the scripture doesn't make
[58:22] that direct tie
[58:24] here's a rich young ruler as the years
[58:26] unfolded who said my barns are full
[58:31] all is well
[58:33] I think I'll just take my rest
[58:35] and it was in that moment God called him
[58:38] my brother and sister what would we be
[58:41] we would be the fattest laziest
[58:43] Christians ever
[58:46] we've got the message praise God I can
[58:48] just lay down on my laurels no sir God
[58:51] left the hunger in you and I had a
[58:54] brother one time told me he said brother
[58:55] Paul I just never feel satisfied and I
[58:57] was like praise the Lord
[58:58] praise the Lord otherwise we'd lay down
[59:00] on the job
[59:02] amen
[59:03] you're getting old see and there that
[59:05] morning the quickening power come and he
[59:08] let me look over the curtain and I've
[59:10] seen all of you over there aha see he
[59:13] said all that you ever loved and all
[59:15] that loved you their give to you see and
[59:19] I've seen them all over there like that
[59:21] what was it quickening power John the
[59:24] Revelator was filled full of quickening
[59:27] power that stood up and seen the end of
[59:32] the uh in from the beginning
[59:35] Isaiah was full of the quickening power
[59:37] and stood up and seen the Millennium and
[59:39] all now let's stop right here let's not
[59:41] move on did you guys catch something
[59:43] right hiding right there in the middle
[59:45] of the quote
[59:47] something that sometimes is misused
[59:49] misrepresented misappropriated and put
[59:52] out in such fashion my brother and
[59:54] sister now look at this he was there
[59:57] beyond the curtain and there that
[59:59] morning the quickening power come and he
[1:00:01] let me look over the curtain and I seen
[1:00:06] all of you
[1:00:09] amen he didn't see a herd of branham's
[1:00:12] he didn't see all just his best friends
[1:00:15] he says I seen all of you and then he
[1:00:19] goes right into all that you love and
[1:00:23] Ever Loved You who was he speaking to my
[1:00:27] brother and sister he was speaking in
[1:00:30] the context of a bride of Christ loving
[1:00:33] a prophet in a prophet's office the word
[1:00:35] says we give him honor and we need to be
[1:00:39] partakers of that honor so we honor the
[1:00:42] word and we honor the prophet and the
[1:00:44] word comes back it's not about this
[1:00:47] natural love it's not about I hunted and
[1:00:49] I fished and I I got to laugh and joke
[1:00:51] my brother and sister all that loved him
[1:00:54] I say today in the right context because
[1:00:57] I am not an idolater
[1:01:01] I am not in fact I struggle because I
[1:01:06] lean the other way a little bit
[1:01:10] but he looked over and he saw me he saw
[1:01:12] you
[1:01:13] and then he immediately steps into
[1:01:16] and he let me know he let me see let me
[1:01:18] hear he let me understand he gave me
[1:01:20] Revelation he gave me quickening power
[1:01:22] that all that love me and all that I
[1:01:26] love and I can tell you the sacrifice
[1:01:28] that he made as a man amen shows that he
[1:01:31] loved the Bride of Jesus Christ because
[1:01:33] he sacrificed not everything my brother
[1:01:36] and sister he had his times he had his
[1:01:38] Joy but I tell you we won't go into
[1:01:41] there but I can tell you that his wife
[1:01:44] sacrificed his children sacrificed and
[1:01:47] he sacrificed and he did it because he
[1:01:49] loved us
[1:01:51] he loved us through the word amen but
[1:01:54] look at this what it is all that you
[1:01:56] ever loved and all loved you that give
[1:01:58] to you
[1:02:00] are these all branhams
[1:02:04] no
[1:02:05] this one you led to the Lord
[1:02:09] as an old wrinkled
[1:02:12] end of life
[1:02:14] sister
[1:02:22] I think we could preach a whole series
[1:02:24] of sermons right off of that right there
[1:02:27] amen I've seen them all over there like
[1:02:29] that
[1:02:31] you see to recognize them my brother and
[1:02:33] sister if it was his brother and
[1:02:35] mom and dad and uncle and
[1:02:38] no sir it was this bride
[1:02:40] it was you and I that he loved
[1:02:43] and we're here today through the word of
[1:02:46] God in honor to the office and honor to
[1:02:49] the sacrifice given loving him amen
[1:02:53] oh the world would twist that they would
[1:02:56] say say proof you're following a man
[1:02:57] well if we're following a man we're
[1:02:59] doing a poor job
[1:03:03] because I've never seen a man yet that
[1:03:04] could open the word and discern the
[1:03:06] thoughts and the intents of the heart
[1:03:09] what was it
[1:03:13] was it quickening power stood up seen
[1:03:15] the end from the beginning
[1:03:18] Isaiah was full of quickening power and
[1:03:21] stood up and seen the Millennium and all
[1:03:24] now look at this my brother and sister
[1:03:25] as John the Revelator was filled full of
[1:03:28] quickening power stood up and seen the
[1:03:30] end from the beginning if we were
[1:03:32] turning our Bibles tonight and we'll
[1:03:34] just be very quick so you don't need to
[1:03:35] but Genesis 1 2 amen says that the
[1:03:39] spirit of God moved
[1:03:41] amen so we're seeing that it moved upon
[1:03:43] the Deep amen so it moved upon every
[1:03:46] seed that God had already deposited it
[1:03:49] was nothing to do with Adam amen it
[1:03:51] wasn't anything to do with what come in
[1:03:53] the future it was the seed that God had
[1:03:56] already placed in the spirit of God move
[1:03:58] and those Spirits amen of that seed came
[1:04:01] to life
[1:04:02] amen by his Spirit moving over them the
[1:04:06] spirit that was in them came to life and
[1:04:08] so we're here my brother and sister
[1:04:10] we're called by the word of God to live
[1:04:12] in the spirit is that not right God
[1:04:14] doesn't want us to be just old dead cold
[1:04:16] formal people amen and the prophet of
[1:04:19] God teaches us if you want to you know
[1:04:21] study it out on the Sabbath you'll
[1:04:23] understand that the Sabbath is is spoke
[1:04:26] of being the Lord's day so we are living
[1:04:30] here today and we are living in the
[1:04:32] Lord's day but is that Saturday or is it
[1:04:34] Sunday so a prophet of God had to come
[1:04:36] in and settle this equation because
[1:04:38] these believe it's Saturday these
[1:04:40] believe it's Sunday and the prophet of
[1:04:42] God showed us and said every day to the
[1:04:45] believer is the Sabbath amen so we live
[1:04:49] in the Lord's Day
[1:04:50] amen not just one day a week that we go
[1:04:53] and get suddenly religious or two days a
[1:04:56] week we get suddenly religious we as the
[1:04:58] bride of Christ are living every single
[1:05:01] day in the Lord's day amen and so if
[1:05:04] every day is the Lord's day then let us
[1:05:07] live in the spirit
[1:05:08] amen because as it was that the word
[1:05:11] anointed moved on the Lord's day and let
[1:05:14] it move upon us on the Lord's day that
[1:05:17] we can live in the spirit did that make
[1:05:19] sense amen now look let's just move on
[1:05:22] and Isaiah was full of quickening power
[1:05:25] he stood and seen the Millennium and all
[1:05:27] quickening power
[1:05:29] and if the spirit that raised up Christ
[1:05:32] from the dead dwell in you it'll Quicken
[1:05:35] your mortal body remember quickening
[1:05:38] power
[1:05:39] look what we've seen in this day the
[1:05:41] quickening power has come to us to open
[1:05:45] the Seven Seals
[1:05:47] now he didn't say the
[1:05:49] quickening power came to me
[1:05:53] foreign
[1:05:54] you see this mystery of the Seven Seals
[1:05:57] that people want to complicate there are
[1:05:59] some that just got it so twisted up that
[1:06:01] you can't even hardly even comprehend
[1:06:03] how they've come to this conclusion when
[1:06:06] the prophet speaks words like this amen
[1:06:09] this wasn't like in 1948 or something my
[1:06:12] brother and sister if dates matter to
[1:06:14] you just look at the date and you'll
[1:06:16] realize God was finishing up opening up
[1:06:19] a revelation to the people that we might
[1:06:22] grasp this that we wouldn't be sitting
[1:06:24] here saying did he mean this did he mean
[1:06:26] that what is this it says a quickening
[1:06:29] power has come to
[1:06:32] us
[1:06:33] did you know in the proper context of
[1:06:35] Old English when you would be standing
[1:06:38] in a group of people and use the word us
[1:06:41] it is inclusive
[1:06:44] not one person in that group saying us
[1:06:48] identifies as me
[1:06:50] us means us
[1:06:52] and the prophet of God says it's come to
[1:06:55] us
[1:06:56] to open the seventh seal oh I'm going to
[1:06:59] step right out on a limb if you guys
[1:07:00] don't mind or thin ice or whatever you
[1:07:03] want to call it my brother and sister do
[1:07:05] you realize you were an integral part of
[1:07:08] the opening of the seventh seal
[1:07:11] amen there was no reason to open it if
[1:07:14] there was no believer to believe it if
[1:07:18] there was no one to take a horse of it
[1:07:20] and act on it and let it live then there
[1:07:23] was no reason to bother even opening it
[1:07:25] it had to be a people as a prophet of
[1:07:28] God speaks a select or special group of
[1:07:32] people that were able to realize through
[1:07:35] the word and say you know what there's
[1:07:37] something about this and I have to
[1:07:40] identify with it not I might if I can
[1:07:43] explain it I might if this circumstance
[1:07:46] something inside of this group of people
[1:07:49] says I must identify with this
[1:07:54] do you believe the seals are open yes
[1:07:55] explain it I can't
[1:07:57] why because it's not the prophet says
[1:08:00] explainable
[1:08:02] because it actually comes by revelation
[1:08:06] and Revelation comes by quickening power
[1:08:12] my oh my
[1:08:16] prayer tonight
[1:08:18] go ahead wrap your mind back around to
[1:08:20] prayer tonight
[1:08:24] without this
[1:08:26] I can't have this
[1:08:28] and laugh out this
[1:08:30] can't go here
[1:08:32] I believe that was ordained to God I
[1:08:34] about jumped out of the chair and
[1:08:35] shouted Hallelujah and ran down the back
[1:08:36] of it
[1:08:37] but I'm getting old and feeble and I
[1:08:39] probably would have fell off
[1:08:41] and I'm telling you my brother and
[1:08:42] sister God knows what he's doing and he
[1:08:44] knows his spirit and brings that down
[1:08:46] he's giving confirmation this is what I
[1:08:48] this is what I'm saying this is what I
[1:08:51] support amen hallelujah
[1:08:55] amen the quickening powers come to us to
[1:08:57] open the Seven Seals that means we're
[1:08:59] part of it has already said what was

[1:09:40] inspiration to take a picture taken by
[1:09:43] someone else to prove what it is imagine
[1:09:46] the inspiration he gives at the opening
[1:09:51] of his word

[1:12:52] what's that Top Line say
[1:12:54] that's right
[1:12:58] Hallelujah
[1:12:59] well that William Branham sure took a
[1:13:01] lot of credit for this and did that and
[1:13:04] he said this and he said that and said
[1:13:06] it was his Revelation I think what I'm
[1:13:08] reading
[1:13:10] amen it ain't what I'm reading
[1:13:13] he's passing along you know in the
[1:13:15] corporate world those who have been
[1:13:17] around the corporate world there's a lot
[1:13:20] of credit taking
[1:13:23] you know if you work for a company and
[1:13:25] you invent something it's the companies
[1:13:28] they had nothing to do with it they
[1:13:29] never did it I knew a man met him one
[1:13:31] time the man's very successful very
[1:13:34] wealthy he's old now wouldn't trade his
[1:13:35] age for his money but um he uh he had
[1:13:39] such a novel idea
[1:13:41] such an incredible idea
[1:13:43] he come home one day he had been
[1:13:45] secretly sketching this out and doing
[1:13:48] all this stuff and he come home one day
[1:13:49] and told his wife honey
[1:13:52] let's go party tonight let's go let's go
[1:13:54] celebrate
[1:13:55] she's like what are we celebrating I
[1:13:57] quit my job
[1:13:59] she's like wow what'd you do
[1:14:03] I said I quit my job today
[1:14:06] and he wouldn't tell her why
[1:14:08] six months went by
[1:14:10] he went down to a patent office
[1:14:13] laid it on the table patented it
[1:14:16] sold the idea off I think it was General
[1:14:18] Electric
[1:14:20] and made millions and millions in
[1:14:22] royalties
[1:14:25] but you see it would have got no credit
[1:14:28] and here's a prophet
[1:14:31] a man
[1:14:33] are you with me tonight
[1:14:35] could have pulled this in
[1:14:37] and said look what I've done
[1:14:40] but that would have made him a liar
[1:14:46] so what's he do
[1:14:48] he says well actually the answer to this
[1:14:50] the revelation of this he
[1:14:53] this is where this come from
[1:14:57] he's the one who opened the seals
[1:14:59] he is those seals for the whole word of
[1:15:02] God is Christ and Christ is the seals
[1:15:06] that was past tense opened amen what is
[1:15:10] the opening of the seals then revealing
[1:15:13] Christ and we got people today saying
[1:15:16] the seals aren't open my brother and
[1:15:18] sister this is going to sound harsh but
[1:15:20] I'm going to say it anyway you can look
[1:15:21] at what they preach you can look at how
[1:15:23] they live and realize something is
[1:15:26] missing because they're saying it's
[1:15:28] closed it's closed what they're actually
[1:15:31] saying is I never met Christ
[1:15:34] because you meet Christ you recognize
[1:15:37] the seals are open I've met him he's
[1:15:40] come in my presence I've been allowed to
[1:15:43] look upon him I've been allowed to
[1:15:45] worship him in his presence that is the
[1:15:49] word my brother and sister
[1:15:51] and the Very seven angels which
[1:15:53] represented the seven churches all
[1:15:56] completed and we couldn't even see it
[1:15:59] they did they took the picture not us
[1:16:02] and there he is standing there Supreme
[1:16:05] judge showing that he is alpha and omega
[1:16:09] beginning and the end what
[1:16:11] identification I'll just throw this in
[1:16:15] here it's not in this quote but when
[1:16:17] that picture was taken I was in him you
[1:16:21] were in him
[1:16:22] amen when they took that picture on
[1:16:24] Sunset Mountain they took a picture of
[1:16:27] you
[1:16:28] oh people be like that's weird no it's
[1:16:31] not I've been in him from the foundation
[1:16:33] of the world before amen and if I was in
[1:16:36] him then I'm in him now amen he hadn't
[1:16:40] exactly forgot me somewhere
[1:16:43] remind me of a time I knew some people
[1:16:45] you know they went home the mom starts
[1:16:47] to cook supper and I forget what their
[1:16:49] little boy's name was I'll just call him

[1:16:53] needs to wash up
[1:16:55] oh
[1:16:57] jump in the station wagon tear down the
[1:16:59] grocery store run in there and there's
[1:17:00] the manager with Junior
[1:17:02] he said no you don't get him back the
[1:17:05] police need to talk to you
[1:17:08] and they're there in the foyer of a
[1:17:10] grocery store honest officer you have to
[1:17:13] understand what kind of kid he is he's
[1:17:14] here one second the guy's like I got a
[1:17:16] kid like that and I've never left him
[1:17:17] anywhere
[1:17:19] amen took him for a little while to
[1:17:21] explain it and basically the cop said
[1:17:22] I'm going to check up on you
[1:17:25] imagine
[1:17:27] we forgot our kid
[1:17:29] imagine the Lord Jesus Christ
[1:17:32] got down about the fifth Church age
[1:17:34] just forgot who you were
[1:17:37] no not gonna happen
[1:17:40] amen if I can just preach and quit
[1:17:43] talking we'll get this done amen
[1:17:46] Howard did that oh
[1:17:48] we'll go back up they did they took they
[1:17:49] took picture not us see so it wasn't God
[1:17:52] God didn't let it be you know a believer
[1:17:56] taking the picture
[1:17:59] believer with the early version of
[1:18:02] Photoshop
[1:18:05] no sir
[1:18:06] he let men
[1:18:08] might have been Godless then
[1:18:10] but he let men that had no connection
[1:18:11] maybe even doubts
[1:18:13] take the picture
[1:18:16] Supreme judge alpha and omega beginning
[1:18:19] in the end what identification
[1:18:20] quickening power

[1:18:42] from the Throne of almighty God come
[1:18:45] down and struck the seed in you just as
[1:18:47] it was in Genesis my brother and sister
[1:18:50] the moving of the spirit moved on us oh
[1:18:53] I got saved at this day well technically

[1:19:14] know what's wrong with you now look at
[1:19:16] this my brother and sister I'm going to
[1:19:18] step out on another limb did we okay on
[1:19:19] that other limb hey man I'm gonna step
[1:19:21] out on the limb do you realize what
[1:19:23] God's doing
[1:19:24] now sometimes a prophet would come down
[1:19:26] or or maybe a minister I've seen it I'm
[1:19:29] not boasting but I've seen it I've
[1:19:31] preached it and people say that's
[1:19:32] exactly right
[1:19:33] but my brother and sister what happens
[1:19:35] oftentimes
[1:19:37] at the preaching of the word
[1:19:40] we see our own faults that's right we
[1:19:45] see our own weakness
[1:19:54] I thought the
[1:19:55] Brothers the start of this service was
[1:19:58] gonna just maybe launch right in
[1:20:01] my brother and sister what do we got to
[1:20:03] do
[1:20:04] when we see
[1:20:06] we got to repent
[1:20:08] we can't just sit there and say okay I
[1:20:10] see my problem
[1:20:11] that's not the anointing that's on the
[1:20:13] bride of Christ the bride of Christ is
[1:20:14] like oh I see my failure Lord forgive me
[1:20:17] and we we go when we start to do
[1:20:19] something about that
[1:20:21] Amen to know what's wrong with you and
[1:20:23] what to do and what you have done and
[1:20:25] what you ought not have done and what
[1:20:27] you should have done and what you will
[1:20:30] be now we could even just totally apply
[1:20:32] this to the prophet but I believe the
[1:20:34] prophet's words were to me
[1:20:36] amen amen and there's times that we know
[1:20:39] we should
[1:20:40] and I know I shouldn't have right and it
[1:20:42] would have been better if I would have
[1:20:44] but I didn't
[1:20:46] and God still loves me
[1:20:48] oh Hallelujah quickening power all these
[1:20:54] things oh my brother and sister I'll
[1:20:56] tell you what I get excited about this

[1:21:43] our lord Jesus is so full of quickening
[1:21:45] power
[1:21:46] he was all of it together he was so full
[1:21:48] of quickening power he said this you
[1:21:50] destroy this body and I'll raise it up
[1:21:53] in three days talk about confidence and
[1:21:55] quickening power destroy this body and
[1:21:58] now this Temple and I'll bring it up in
[1:22:00] three days why what do you say that he
[1:22:03] knew
[1:22:04] that it was written of him
[1:22:07] well I'm going to tell you my brother
[1:22:09] and sister amen he knew what was written
[1:22:13] of him by the word of God which could
[1:22:15] not fail I can't help it I've just got
[1:22:18] to leap off of this and Jump Right In
[1:22:19] I'm telling you tonight we the bride of
[1:22:22] Jesus Christ know what is written of us
[1:22:25] and we know God's word cannot fail amen
[1:22:30] that's how you can have confidence to
[1:22:31] stand in the age that we stand in why
[1:22:34] what Satan would say I'm going to
[1:22:35] destroy your life I'm going to do all of
[1:22:38] these things and we can stand and say
[1:22:40] not unless my Lord gives you approval
[1:22:43] amen go ahead fill out the application
[1:22:46] send it in and wait for a millennia to
[1:22:49] see what God's answer is to your request
[1:22:52] amen why because my brother and sister
[1:22:56] this bride of this hour that Victorious
[1:23:00] lady we were talking about she is
[1:23:02] recognizing through
[1:23:05] the lines
[1:23:10] um
[1:23:12] why did only one leper come back
[1:23:16] because when Jesus spoke
[1:23:19] by quickening Power by revelation
[1:23:23] he started now look how God works
[1:23:25] I don't want to get sidetracked here but
[1:23:27] look how God works he's already headed
[1:23:29] down the path to the priest
[1:23:31] and quickening Power
[1:23:39] who is my priest
[1:23:43] and he just come down to a stop
[1:23:47] theirs my priest
[1:23:51] it changed the direction of his life
[1:23:55] don't think of a man just walking down a
[1:23:57] trail or a road stopping turning around
[1:24:00] we're talking about God changing
[1:24:02] directions of lives
[1:24:05] not just footsteps lives
[1:24:08] amen so our lord Jesus knew the word
[1:24:12] said will not suffer my Holy One to see
[1:24:14] corruption neither will I leave his soul
[1:24:15] in hell and he knowed that quickening
[1:24:17] power would raise him up that there
[1:24:19] wouldn't be one cell corrupt he said you
[1:24:21] destroy this Temple and I'll bring it
[1:24:23] back again in three days now my brother
[1:24:26] and sister I want to say if the prophet
[1:24:28] of God preaching this word and he's
[1:24:30] preaching it to a bride of Christ would
[1:24:32] we not have confidence in that
[1:24:34] quickening power that we could stand
[1:24:36] here and say this word amen is not going
[1:24:39] to bring me short of the Rapture it's
[1:24:41] not going to take me away from the
[1:24:43] Rapture this word has been quickened to
[1:24:46] a bride is going to take me into the
[1:24:48] Rapture because I
[1:24:53] and the opening
[1:24:55] of the revelation of Jesus Christ I am
[1:24:59] his expression on the Earth today I am
[1:25:02] his life manifested and if he had such
[1:25:06] confidence that he would not suffer
[1:25:09] corruption then this bride of Christ
[1:25:11] should be able to stand with confidence
[1:25:13] and say I will not suffer corruption
[1:25:17] Hallelujah
[1:25:19] amen
[1:25:21] amen my
[1:25:23] ah
[1:25:26] I say Lord help us tonight to be the
[1:25:30] people who see what's written of us
[1:25:32] amen hallelujah
[1:25:35] now look at this I hope my little
[1:25:39] analogy isn't too far off
[1:25:41] hey man as we move forward here God has
[1:25:43] given us a grand opportunity
[1:25:45] you see we'll either look at it as a
[1:25:47] grand opportunity
[1:25:49] or we'll look at it as a burden
[1:25:54] let me bring a little clarity
[1:25:59] whose image do we bear
[1:26:02] b-e-a-r
[1:26:07] or b-a-r-e
[1:26:10] one mostly represented as a burden
[1:26:12] something you carry
[1:26:15] the other
[1:26:17] are precious girls and boys ears
[1:26:20] is naked
[1:26:24] I didn't misspell it
[1:26:28] because we can cloak ourselves
[1:26:30] any way we want to cloak ourselves
[1:26:33] but Who We Are
[1:26:35] it's when we stand naked before God
[1:26:40] no amount of cloaks no amount of
[1:26:41] garments no amount of our words no
[1:26:43] amount of our religion
[1:26:45] can cover us up
[1:26:47] when that day comes we are completely
[1:26:50] laid bare
[1:26:52] what will be
[1:26:54] our image then
[1:26:56] what will we look like
[1:26:59] what will we represent
[1:27:03] my brother and sister you know what the
[1:27:05] definition of religion is don't you
[1:27:08] to cover it
[1:27:12] what are we when we're laid bare
[1:27:15] religion don't matter no more
[1:27:20] that's why Through the Ages
[1:27:23] the greatest humiliation That Conquers
[1:27:25] put upon the conquered
[1:27:30] was to make them bear and March them
[1:27:33] through the streets
[1:27:37] but this bride
[1:27:40] quickening power
[1:27:43] I'm not talking in the flesh follow me
[1:27:47] says make me bear that's right
[1:27:50] I don't want one thing in my life
[1:27:51] covered up
[1:27:54] expose me Lord does that not go against
[1:27:56] our human nature
[1:27:58] expose Me Lord
[1:28:00] but this is the bride that the word says
[1:28:02] there won't even be a smudge on the hymn
[1:28:04] of her garment
[1:28:06] so she is willing to submit herself
[1:28:09] to a thorough cleansing that's right
[1:28:13] praise the Lord
[1:28:15] I I just felt like I left a little bit
[1:28:17] of confusion on that so forgive me for
[1:28:20] bringing that up tonight distracting it
[1:28:23] you see God's given us this Grand
[1:28:25] opportunity my brother and sister it's
[1:28:27] seven ages of Revelation it's not Seven
[1:28:29] Ages that it took God to fulfill his
[1:28:31] word it's seven ages of compound
[1:28:34] Revelation strapped up for you and I
[1:28:38] that we can see this is how it was in
[1:28:40] the beginning this is the next stage
[1:28:42] this is the next stage this is the next
[1:28:43] stage and we're seeing what a
[1:28:45] supernatural revealing of God that come
[1:28:48] to the culmination of the absolute
[1:28:50] revealing of Jesus Christ
[1:28:54] and God said I I can take the time
[1:28:57] I have no problem
[1:28:59] he didn't have any Supply resource
[1:29:01] issues
[1:29:02] he didn't have any any you know I've got
[1:29:05] to try and make this happen no my
[1:29:07] brother and sister he could have just
[1:29:08] snapped his fingers it would have been
[1:29:09] done
[1:29:10] Seven Ages of quickly power of revealed
[1:29:13] word now I I like my analogy because uh
[1:29:16] I I would have stayed in school and
[1:29:18] graduated if they'd done this but do you
[1:29:21] realize we've been given this quickening
[1:29:23] power of Revelation it's like an open
[1:29:26] book test at school
[1:29:29] could have even graduated if they'd just
[1:29:31] let me open the book
[1:29:35] yeah
[1:29:37] yeah
[1:29:39] teacher in history now Paul in the
[1:29:41] chapter were studying who was it left
[1:29:44] Spain on a ship and traveled where for
[1:29:46] how long and I'm like
[1:29:48] um I wasn't trying to be funny
[1:29:51] um oh I can't remember that Spanish
[1:29:52] dude's name
[1:29:54] um yeah anyway you sailed for a long
[1:29:56] time and she's like did you read this
[1:29:58] and I said
[1:29:59] um mostly
[1:30:02] and she's like what do you mean by
[1:30:04] mostly I said well I read the beginning
[1:30:05] and I read the end
[1:30:07] you know I learned that
[1:30:09] in church
[1:30:12] you might think it's funny but I learned
[1:30:15] that in church amen we read beginning
[1:30:17] and we read the end and we know the
[1:30:19] devil lost amen that's the whole book
[1:30:20] right there what do you mean details
[1:30:23] about 1612 and this and that and they
[1:30:26] died from scurvy and blah blah blah on
[1:30:28] the whatever no that matters they made
[1:30:30] it there that's all that matters
[1:30:36] but you see
[1:30:37] I want you to catch this now
[1:30:42] Satan keeps kicking your flesh
[1:30:44] into the Limelight
[1:30:48] why
[1:30:49] because you're a loser
[1:30:52] because you're defeated
[1:30:55] it's called distraction
[1:30:58] all he's trying to do is distract us
[1:31:01] from
[1:31:02] what the word
[1:31:04] said about us
[1:31:09] well rubber hits the road of any of us
[1:31:11] lately
[1:31:13] done something that we stopped and said
[1:31:15] why in the world
[1:31:17] did I do that
[1:31:21] okay and we're two there's a majority
[1:31:24] right
[1:31:26] now look at this my brother and sister
[1:31:28] Satan he's like but you did but you did
[1:31:31] you did
[1:31:32] what is it all he's trying to do is draw
[1:31:35] your flesh into the position where the
[1:31:38] word is supposed to be
[1:31:40] amen he's trying to pull our Flash in
[1:31:42] and when we get to looking at our flesh
[1:31:44] we certainly won't be looking at the
[1:31:46] word because the word says when our
[1:31:48] heart condemns us not then we have
[1:31:50] confidence in God so what is he doing
[1:31:53] he's actually stealing our confidence by
[1:31:56] getting us to look at our flesh
[1:31:58] and the more we focus on our flesh
[1:32:01] the more we feel like I couldn't be
[1:32:05] but let me tell you my brother and
[1:32:07] sister this quickening power that's in
[1:32:10] you God has let you as the bride know
[1:32:13] what's been written of you amen amen now
[1:32:15] I wanna I just I might just have to pick
[1:32:18] this up
[1:32:19] amen now I'm going to go somewhere right
[1:32:22] here my brother and sister that you
[1:32:25] might
[1:32:26] might wonder where I'm coming from
[1:32:28] I just recently
[1:32:30] was listening to a man
[1:32:33] and he was being interviewed by
[1:32:35] obviously another another former
[1:32:38] believer
[1:32:39] and they're talking
[1:32:42] and the man is like
[1:32:44] yeah you know what about this
[1:32:46] denominational Spirit around the message
[1:32:48] this man's like
[1:32:50] strongest denominational Spirit I've
[1:32:53] ever seen
[1:32:56] they can't do anything until they hear
[1:32:59] from headquarters
[1:33:02] and you might say what are they talking
[1:33:04] about
[1:33:05] but I'm sitting there in my chair praise
[1:33:08] the Lord
[1:33:12] can't do
[1:33:14] thing until I I've heard from
[1:33:17] headquarters
[1:33:18] but headquarters doesn't have an address
[1:33:21] it doesn't have a phone number the
[1:33:24] headquarters is here on Earth but it's
[1:33:27] walking in Flash today a man walking and
[1:33:31] talking and living and manifesting
[1:33:34] that's the hearing of headquarters I
[1:33:36] want to hear that still Small Voice I
[1:33:39] want to hear that leadership of the Lord
[1:33:41] but you see how that Spirit would come
[1:33:43] and they've got a quickening on them but
[1:33:46] it's a quickening to look and find and
[1:33:49] to classify and to put it and know there
[1:33:51] might be some that fit that gentleman's
[1:33:53] point of view it's not the Bride of
[1:33:57] Jesus Christ The Bride of Jesus Christ
[1:34:00] has one voice that she hears
[1:34:03] amen and that makes me really happy as a
[1:34:06] pastor amen that you're not relying on
[1:34:08] my voice you're not relying on my
[1:34:10] knowledge you're not relying on what I
[1:34:12] can reveal to you but it's God himself
[1:34:15] making quickening power into our soul
[1:34:19] and the word become a Living Word it
[1:34:21] became a flaming sword a Living Word
[1:34:24] coming from the Throne of almighty God
[1:34:27] oh Hallelujah cause this bride knows
[1:34:31] what is written of her
[1:34:33] I'm not just a church member I'm not
[1:34:36] just a Christian as it were I'm the
[1:34:39] Bride of Jesus Christ amen The Book of
[1:34:42] Revelation makes it very clear she's
[1:34:45] clothed in fine linen the righteousness
[1:34:49] of the Saints not clothed in some carnal
[1:34:52] look some carnal deal some carnal
[1:34:54] explanation but in the revelation of
[1:34:58] Jesus Christ this my brother and sister
[1:35:00] is the opening of the seventh seal when
[1:35:04] we recognize we are in Christ and we are
[1:35:08] all he said we would be
[1:35:10] oh hallelujah oh Hallelujah I've got so
[1:35:14] many more notes we just need to stop
[1:35:16] hallelujah sister vika would you come
[1:35:19] amen while she's coming walk slow sister
[1:35:22] Bika amen
[1:35:25] what causes us to do this
[1:35:27] amen Philippians 2 13 I didn't I don't
[1:35:30] think I gave this note to the brothers
[1:35:33] for it is God that worketh in you both
[1:35:36] to Will and to do of his good pleasure
[1:35:39] amen what happened we lost our mind
[1:35:42] had a man that's left a message one time
[1:35:44] on telephone conversation told me Paul
[1:35:46] you've lost your mind I'm like praise
[1:35:49] God hallelujah because my mind calls me
[1:35:51] a lot of trouble
[1:35:55] foreign
[1:36:01] amen thank you Lord of your good
[1:36:03] pleasure yeah we'll stop right here I've
[1:36:06] still got some scripture some quotes
[1:36:07] different things here yeah my brother
[1:36:11] and sister
[1:36:13] I was gonna die for a moment to the
[1:36:15] resume
[1:36:16] of the church agents here but
[1:36:18] we'll we'll be okay
[1:36:21] you see in that first stage the
[1:36:23] indictment I do want to close this out
[1:36:25] the indictment was as they left their
[1:36:28] first love
[1:36:29] so there was a point in time that they
[1:36:32] were on fire
[1:36:35] and I hope you catch this point
[1:36:38] they were on fire but they had left
[1:36:41] their first love
[1:36:43] they had moved away from their first
[1:36:46] love
[1:36:46] [Music]
[1:36:48] and God doesn't come as it were with an
[1:36:50] indictment
[1:36:52] you know good people
[1:36:53] [Music]
[1:36:56] I'm going to judge you and send you to
[1:36:59] Hades
[1:37:01] no what does he do he says return repent
[1:37:04] and just return back
[1:37:07] do your first love just come back
[1:37:10] I tell you what God's been gracious to
[1:37:12] me
[1:37:14] oh do I know what it's like that the
[1:37:17] Lord said just return back just do a
[1:37:20] little repenting
[1:37:22] see it stirred my heart when that come
[1:37:23] out the first of the service
[1:37:25] just a little repenting
[1:37:27] just come back
[1:37:30] but you see there's got to be a
[1:37:32] quickening power
[1:37:34] revealed to us
[1:37:36] what we are coming back to
[1:37:41] I don't want to go back our family being
[1:37:44] what it is
[1:37:45] there's Catholics
[1:37:48] there's Mormons
[1:37:49] there's an Nazarene
[1:37:51] there's methodists
[1:37:53] some Pentecostals to throw it in
[1:37:57] without quickening power
[1:37:59] we wouldn't know what took
[1:38:04] the god-riching mercy
[1:38:08] Mercy says look just repent and come
[1:38:12] back to your first love and my brother
[1:38:14] and sister what happened is we just
[1:38:16] bypassed all of these distractions
[1:38:19] people would be like what are you doing
[1:38:21] can't you just be like us no
[1:38:24] I Heard a Voice call me
[1:38:27] first love
[1:38:28] and when I didn't even know
[1:38:31] that I loved him I realized I love him
[1:38:33] because he first loved me and all I can
[1:38:38] do tonight is say thank you thank you
