according [Music] to be unto me according to your word according to your promises I can stand to carve upon my heart all the truth that sets me free according to your word oh Lord be [Music] it aren't you glad tonight you can say Amen to that just to know every promise that God has given I just think it's wonderful there because U just our little thought tonight be very very simple I want to speak to you about the Next Generation and all through the scripture we see the reference of God blessing a generation cursing a generation being with those in that Generation all of these generational things and here we are tonight and you know we have to be planning what the next generation will do we have to lay all of the stones we have to build the foundation as it were of the Tabernacle for the Next Generation we can say well uh we're we're here looking for in our generation but we have to understand that in this moment of time there's another generation coming but there's also a generation that's leaving us and so the church has always been built upon the foundation of the Next Generation we're looking forward if we do not introduce our children to the Lord Jesus Christ to they do not receive the baptism of the Holy Ghost if they don't have a personal relationship there will be no Next Generation but God has given us a beautiful gift not something that we have to produce in and of ourself we don't have to say we've got to make this happen but what we do is just lay the groundwork and sometimes as we'll look back through the Bible we won't revisit all of this tonight but you look uh they laid their life down for the Next Generation they sacrificed themselves for for their next generation and uh which might be their very own children but they lay that out they don't say well if God if God wants it to be then it'll come to pass the word says he wants it to be and he expects us to be part of the bringing of it to pass I'll just give you a little quick type the spirit and the bride say come if the bride sits down and says I'll speak I'll make a noise I'll be a witness if God wants me to he's already declared he wants you to he's already declared you are the voice of the end time amen good to see each and every one of you tonight let's just turn in our Bibles amen as we'll just take I I've used this scripture a few times lately in Jeremiah 29:11 but um you know I just keep coming back to it because uh you see uh I I know uh the thoughts God has to me the thoughts God has to you we we know that the word thank you musicians uh sure enjoyed the song service brother Alex uh and so he says right here in verse 11 for I know the thoughts that I think toward you sayith the Lord thoughts of peace and not of evil to give you an expected end now if we'll just focus on that little thought right there God's already got an expect Ed end for us amen that we we sometimes you know and I I don't want to be too harsh but it's almost like it's denominational thinking that we're still somehow got to labor to get ourselves in here what we've got to labor is just to Simply accept it and act upon it in every situation Lord help me amen that's what we're not going to labor and get ourselves in what we got to do is labor to get ourselves out of the picture because God's already said you are in the picture amen hallelujah thoughts of Peace not of evil to give you an expected end then shall ye call upon me and ye shall go and pray unto me and I will hearken unto you and ye shall seek me and oh I love this amen not a question mark there ye shall seek me and find me when you shall search for me with all Your Heart Lord help us to search for you with all of our heart Lord bless this time tonight Lord Jesus we thank you for your grace and mercy Lord just help us the little sniffles and these things Lord that would just try to hold us back but we just claim the blood we claim the healing virtue and the power of our Lord Jesus Christ tonight Lord that we can do father great things in the word tonight just want to Father just uh remember those who are not here uh the struggle of life our our brother Sergey on the road brother vasile I I believe probably on the road by now uh Lord and and each and every one father that we would have need of tonight oh Lord that you would just speak to each heart be kind to us father we ask Lord just ask for your word to come forth the way you would desire in the name of Jesus Christ amen you may be seated had a nice little visit with our brother John Andes uh and uh he sends his greetings to all of you and uh you know you just have to love brother John uh when I called him you know the he answered the phone and the first thing I hear is hallelujah hallelujah and so you know you just got to love a man that no matter what you know just has that kind of enthusiasm so greetings to you uh from Brother John Andes his family and the church there amen as we look at this I want to just draw attention for a moment upon three elements here first you have to call upon him and and I would pray you know is is it has to be something we should not have to labor to call upon the Lord he is not the 911 of Our Lives he is there everpresent with us he's not only to be called upon emergencies but we should learn to just draw him into every element whether it be going to work or traveling or whatever it might be a difficult situation sometimes my brothers and sisters uh we we will be uh venturing you might say in business or something and we need to know whether to go forward or to stop and you know it's so easy just to draw our Lord into it and just ask him Lord if this is not supposed to happen please close the door and uh you know sometimes God allows the door to be unlocked and he's waiting for us to find the faith to you might say reach out and lay a finger on that door but at the same time we don't come with a battering ram and a sledgehammer and a sawall and say nope God opened the door but we have to find that balance in our lives and so when we look upon this we call upon the Lord now the word says that when we call upon him he draws nigh to us can anyone tonight testify that that is the truth amen that when we call upon his name not half-hearted like oh Lord but a serious call upon him he comes right down in our midst and he speaks to us and he answers and I don't know if this ever happens to you but you know sometimes you know we have questions and and uh you know I tell you when I was a younger man uh it impacted me greatly when the prophet of God was there at his cave and he had those questions before the Lord and the wind would come and blow his his Bible open and then he thought oh well that's not really an answer there is was a breeze and close it again and the wind would blow it right back to the same exact scripture God was using that breeze amen he's in the wind and was speaking to the prophet and so when we look at that and realize the keys that God is using uh to speak and when we call upon him he said I draw near or nigh unto you and I say Lord help us to make that one of the the foremost things that we do in the elements of life is to call upon the Lord and then he follows this here in Jeremiah and tells them you know um I I want you to go and pray unto me so just uh drawing nigh to him calling upon Him is not quite the same as praying right we can say oh Lord uh you know give me wisdom but how about get specific about what your need for this wisdom is and and pray out and and ask and wait you know one of the the failures I think we have in humanity is uh and and I know sometimes in my busy life I I do this and I'm not proud of this I want to break this habit but we'll pray and before even our words almost go into The Ether we're already up and gone and so you know it's like Lord bless my day and you know I'm trying to break that habit I'm trying to to get to the place that I I want to really take a moment and and we can justify to ourselves well I'm praying I prayed this morning sister Jerry and I have devotions in the morning and you know sometimes uh they're pretty abbreviated I'm sorry to say and it's usually Paul's fault because Paul has a zillion things went to bed last night with unfinished things got up this morning somehow overnight they didn't finish themselves and so it's there that just like devotions breakfast you know got to go but you know what we really need to make that time and I'm preaching to Paul in case this seems a little direct but I I need to just take that time and and uh you know he says you pray unto me and I'll hearken unto you I I'm going to hear you I give you this assurance that I'm listening to your needs and he says you shall seek me and when you search for me with all your heart my I tell you I believe that God understands our lives but I believe that we should understand that we've got more of Our Lives to give we've got more to give back than we seem to think and you know we look at God's plans for our futures and and uh you know sometimes we we have I I I'm a firm believer in in planning your future young people if the Lord so leads you to to get a certain education or to do certain things if it's in the will of God pursue it but you know the thing is is it's as the scripture says seek ye first amen so if we we go and do all these things without God blessing it well we will be able to say God was with us but maybe not to the degree he would have if we had committed it fully to him and so as we look at this I I just want to jump down into Psalms 119 uh 102 to 106 and uh forgive me tonight just been suffering with some kind of allergy or something and then you know there's always a action and a reaction Psalms 1119 says I have not departed from thy judgments now this is David declaring unto the Lord I have not departed from thy judgments for thou Hast taught me I want him to be my teacher how sweet are thy words unto my taste yay sweeter than honey to my mouth through thy precepts I get understanding therefore I hate every false way now you look at this I want to just elaborate on that for just a moment of uh hating every false way do you realize my brother and sister what God has done to you and I it sometimes the false way sometimes the teaching it is actually just seems to make more sense and more comfortable and it's more reasonable to our hearing and yet God has done something to you and I that we come to the place that we hate every false way and that alarm that God put in you you know that subconscious I was just reading brother Brown's talking about this he's talking about the little deer how that he put that in that little deer there's something in there and the little deer don't know why he start starts to shake and get nervous he doesn't understand exactly what it is he can't see the enemy might not even be able to smell the enemy but there's something there that he senses something isn't right and he put that in that little deer that when that enemy the wolf or whatever it might be is coming upon the little deer that he's he's starting to look around he's no longer comfortable just shoving his head in the grass but he starts to look around and say what is it and that's the same Instinct in the whole holy spirit that God has given to you and I that when people with wrong spirits and different things and I don't mean to elaborate too much there's nothing other than just a teaching moment but you know brother brandham said all Satan has done has perverted the word so when a perversion a perverted Spirit comes it might be just a little twist of Doctrine might be a little twist of something it might be people justifying their behavior whatever it would be but when that Spirit comes the bride starts to get a little nervous there's something in the air that she doesn't sense or she does sense but it it isn't right and she starts to say Lord what is this and many times you'll see people are get very concerned about you know being deceived we' we've talked about this many times but let's remember God put something in you amen we don't have to talk about well we know the word we know this we know that God's put something in the bride that knows things are not right and Lord help us to just yield and let the Holy Spirit deal with us and give us guidance amen hallelujah you know you you go and and I I I think South Africa there the experiences we've had is quite uh to me startling drives at home my brother and sister you'll see there how that the the uh leopard he will slink through the grass and we've experienced this personally that they can move so close not be seen we're looking at it saying hey hey gazelle hey you gazelle you and sometimes we think that little gazelle right here that you know he's he's going to be the one the cat jumps on but what he does is the cat's looking and he's got the one who's got his head stuffed in the grass and the cat's already made several bounds before the other one looks up up and says oh my you see the holy spirit is our warning he is our strength he's our guidance he's the one and we need to learn my brother and sister and you know this is actually a teachable moment now we can't teach our children the Holy Spirit but we can teach our children or make it aware to them and when I say children I mean whatever uh spectrum of age that there is to to when this alarm goes off heed it pay attention to it don't ignore it somebody says hey go out and go with us to here and you know go over here we're going to go to the movies we're going to go park on the dam we're going to go do this and that alarm goes off we can make our children aware that you need to heed that that warning you need to heed that alarm clock not alarm clock alarm warning that is going off you need to heat it because there's Generations before you will tell you that we didn't heed it and there was always trouble there and we see how sweet the words are to my taste sweeter than honey through thy precepts I get understanding therefore I hate every false way now this is not a personal hate my brother and sister this is something that becomes repugnant that becomes something that we push away from something that we we are willing to let go and verse 105 says Thy word is a lamp unto my feet and a light into my path and I have sworn and I will perform it that I will keep thy righteous judgment what something you know we don't uh uh speak in the sense of what the world calls swearing or but when we sworn it's like an oath that we've told the Lord you I'm going to obey your word Lord I'm going to stand on this word and I will perform and I'll keep thy righteous judgment and my brother and sister if this seems strange to us every one of us in some form or another in our own words our own way have performed this or sworn to the Lord I'm going to serve you it is an oath as it were it is a commitment that is made it is something that is spoken out from the heart or even from our lips that Lord I want to serve you as David said I want to dwell in the house of the Lord all the days of my life that's what I'm talking about amen I'm not talking about going out and saying a bunch of words and and just saying well I I made some kind of commitment but David put it so well in words that I want to live dwell in your house all the days of my life and he's making that commitment and putting it out there and saying that's what I want to stand by and I say Lord help us help us and you know some might say well you know that that wouldn't work because I've already failed him no my brother and sister God already knew what you were going to do knew every step you would take every word that you would speak every thought that you would think amen either that or he's not God and he's already said I made the way for you to be able to stand in my house and say this is where I want to be all the days of my life and Grace my brother and sister is sufficient in God's eyes it steamrolls over every accusation that Satan's got everything that we have failed everything we come short it steam rolls right over it and God says you're in my house Hallelujah well look at this this is taken out of Luke 1:50 and this is really scripture that is there concerning as it is being recounted of Mary there in the Book of Luke but I want to just draw this verse out it caught my attention and his Mercy is on them that fear Him from generation to generation I remember one time a brother told me he says I just you know was looking and I I just has God just choose a family and just bless them well that's what the word says amen God chooses a family and blesses them now we know many here even amongst us there are the only one in their family that is a Believer but God has given promises and we are looking forward and back my brother and sister I don't care brother Trevor sister Carrie going to visit family I don't care there circumstance as long as there's breath there's life There's Hope amen we get you know get to looking at things you know especially those even that have left the message left what we believe left the word of God and we look at that and the devil like to discourage us but my brother and sister as long as they're breathing There's Hope amen and we should hold to that hope amen and raise up nothing more my own granddaughter here and those that are very special to me amen I sit here and look and I don't just hope for your future I pray positively for your future I pray that as a young child as a teenager that the presence of God surrounds you young people and Carries you forward and when the alarm goes off I pray that you have learned and your parents have taught and the preaching of the word is sufficient that when the alarm goes off that you're going to say I'm out of here I'm not going any farther forward I'm not going to to embrace this the alarm is going off but you see if we're not careful the cares of Life make it such that we think I can deal with this God didn't call you to deal with it he called you to be as it were that when the alarm goes off you run right back into his presence you run right into the Tabernacle you run right into the altar not saying I think I can deal with it and if not there's Grace you know that's a denominational teaching of the day live like you want claim Grace my brother and sister Grace is not for our misbehavior Grace is for when we fail we know that there's only one way to eternal life that is our Lord Jesus Christ we could also take that and word it in such a fashion if we may there's only one way to eternal life and that's through the word because Jesus Christ was the word now Matthew hope yall don't mind if the service is a little abbreviated tonight not sure as I said that it won't be but Matthew the 7th chapter verses 13- 27 we may not read all of this but as we look at this we recognize as we're talking about the Next Generation right every one of us has got a test testimony can we say Amen to that and sometimes our testimonies are very similar but some testimonies um I hope won't be similar I'm trying to break my habit of throwing people under the bus but it seems weird to use yourself for an example I hope young people that none of you choose the route of backsliding in your teens because what'll happen is you'll just have a long rough rocky road but God will draw you right back in and so it's better to recognize that God called you that who you are is not subject to the spirit of Loda it is not something that you know I I'll just be honest with you when I hear that it's in song and it's in statement oh they're just working on their testimony well I'll tell you the testimony you need to work on is I've been in the house of the Lord all the days of my life that's the testimony we should be working on not this idea that we go out here and we do this and do that and go there and go there and get bit and scarred and tainted and then God calls us home my brother and sister that's not the testimony we should be working on Amen we should be teaching and coaching and encouraging our children do what's right do the word not kind of some kind of recovery plan I've never met a man who successfully recovered from being an alcoholic that says I would go back and do that again cuz I was working on my testimony no sir they leave scars they have trouble they have even you might say Nightmares From the life that they did and the mistakes that they made and many a time as you see them I'm speaking in the Christian realm these men come and say oh that God would have kept me from going down that road but I wouldn't listen so if we're going to choose tonight if we had a whiteboard we would write on here work on your testimony that I shall dwell in the house of the Lord all the days of my life now Matthew 713- 27 it says ENT ye at the Straight Gate for wide is the gate and Broad is the way that leadth to destruction and many there be which go in there at because straight is the gate and narrow is the way which leadth into life few there be that find it beware of false prophets now I want you to make this connection here in Matthew that it goes from finding the gate to false prophets in one verse one bit of writing because you see it will be the false prophet that encourages you that this gate is wide God intended it to be that way because we have Grace well I've met grace and grace is wonderful but I don't want to go before my Lord one day with some kind of hope that grace is sufficient to cover bad behavior bad judgment bad Doctrine could go right down the list right so there it is so there'll be few that find it the false prophets are telling you we have the gate God's given us the gate so just listen to us and you'll get in the gate but my brother and sister the word said what I want you to do is go back to the word and find the gate through the word and when you find the gate through the word it wouldn't matter if the gate was this wide or that wide you'll make it in the gate because you're in the word but when we reason it now I'll get to a point here in a minute uh so beware of the false prophets they come to you in sheep's clothing but inwardly they are ravening wolves and you shall know them by their fruits so every ravening wolf has some kind of fruit that he is displaying and sometimes it's so good you don't notice it I Marvel you got to you got to love this I have to share this with you when I was in my teens there was another young man grew up with and we were doing construction work together and typically when a job would get finished we would get some pretty good siiz paychecks and and uh you know one day uh I can even get so close it's the bank that's right in the parking lot of cart your Mall US bank now is what it was it was Ido First National back then and we come out of there and you know I loved cash still do I I'm sorry to admit it hope you guys don't mind you can you can have plastic I take cash but anyway uh it's the love of money right I just liked it I didn't love it so look at this now we walk out of the bank we both got pockets full of cash and I I Marvel at this we were too naive growing up in the message in our little world we were too naive to put it all together but this man comes up and goes hey hey guys uh you guys look like you would be the kind of guys that would like a fancy watch and literally I'm not kidding you he open opens his coat just like all of the symbolics you know just and and he's got all these watches and he said and my friend says oh I really like the looks of that one he pulls it on you know he shows it to him he tries it on and he goes yeah this watch in the Bon marhe is uh you know $275 and the alarm starts going off I've been in the bond Marse I've never seen a spot their store they sell watches the guy keeps going on and I'm like do I say something it's my friend I told him hey um Bon mer doesn't sell watches and the guy immediately say how crafty the devil is you don't know what you're talking about you're a young man you probably never even go in there Bon marhe is a woman's store oh no no I bought I bought dress clothes in there oh you don't even know what you're talking about my friend obviously showed his confidence in me yeah what's the deal with you buys the watch doesn't even go week it quits he takes it to a jewelry store to get the watch to work and the guy goes oh yeah this is about the 50th one of these that I have it's junk throw it in the trash so you know at the time I told him you want to watch go buy a real watch go from a store that if it quits you go back in there and say this thing has quit and and and the guy just brushed over that he had an answer for everything maneuver it my brother and sister there's a wolf now if that man had been a preacher imagine how effective he would have been yeah that anointing that was there so you see what happens is is because it is very straight to the gate they have to go as it were figuratively at night and they have to move the boundary marker of the word to make it look like that there's way more room for living like you want to live and that is what you see when I give just a short abbreviated version here is when they were anointed to come and make such an emphasis about Grace now their emphasis on Grace my brother and sister doesn't even touch how awesome and wonderful and wide reaching that real Grace is but they present Grace as something that they can push a button and it's all going to go away God's going to ignore everything that happened that didn't go the memory is wiped out but you see it is because the false prophets come and it's there and if you give them time you can look behind their life what they're leaving behind you can see that young people I want you if you would listen to me tonight I want you even to Brother Paul's life Brother Paul's Ministry I want you to look at it with a magnifying glass and if it don't line up with the word of God you don't listen to me because that's how close it will come to deceive the very elect it will try so hard to deceive you but the prophet of God said it can't deceive you so just be confident and take that maybe even you might say practice that now look if it's because I don't tie my shoes the same as you that it doesn't count and if I you know the other day I I come to church and fortunately I caught it before I come out I don't know how I got out of the house that way but you know it's always a little weird when you're ties about like that that's not a deceiver okay he's not trying to draw your attention away from something so everything know ye that by them fruits men gather Grapes of thorns figs of thistles even so every good tree bringeth forth good fruit but a corrupt tree bringeth forth evil fruit and I I don't I want to change the scripture but I want to add this to you but a corrupted tree cannot bring forth good fruit period a good tree cannot bring forth evil fruit neither can a corrup tree bring forth good fruit every tree that bringeth not forth good fruit is he down and if you don't mind can I go on a rant tonight it's about time in the message we quit making excuses for those whose fruit aren't good and we start but but you just have to understand I do I want to stand boldly tonight and tell you I do understand the word says that those that are good bring forth good fruit and those that are not good bring forth corrupt or evil fruit and it's time that we quit making excuses for these kinds of Ministries and behaviors and whatever I'm not talking about being judgmental but in that realm right there when you have somebody who 15 years ago behaved that way and today here in 2024 still behave that way and haven't changed a drop and people are still making excuses for them it's time we stop that it's time that we start looking at the fruit this is not judgment my brother and sister they're actually bring their own judgment because everyone just like Cain he came and offered his fruit to The Altar and it wasn't that God was in a sense picking on Cain but God said hey look if this is this is what you have to offer you need to go back and bring something else to offer and Cain says no this is my fruit and I'm proud of it I'm not going to go change I'm not going to make another altar I'm not going to clean or sanctify my altar I'm going to take it and basically say God accept it or not this is all I'm going to give you I'm I'm here my brother and sister tonight I'm here to to be changed by the word I want our young people in a world we live in that's getting darker and darker I want them to be changed by the word I don't want them to be good little Christians good little message kids coming to a point that when they're 20 years old they light the rocket and they're out of here I want by the time they're 20 years old they know I was called of God I've got the Holy Ghost this is who I am this is my identity I see myself in the word and it's alive and it's real and it's in me because there comes a time that those who don't bring forth good fruit is he down and cast in the fire whereby their FR fruits you'll know them and so as we look at this pretty strong words that we have I want to just hurry along here because not everyone that says unto me Lord Lord shall enter the kingdom and uh have we not prophesied have we not cast out devils in thy name haven't we done Mighty works and he's going to come back and say you know what I never knew you depart from me because they weren't 100% the word it's crazy to use this for an example but um I remember one time I was shopping with sister Jerry and this man was there in the aisle in the coolers with his wife older gentleman and his wife's like put that back that's not real orange juice and I I think they had a little humor going between them but it was a little hard to decide and he's like I'm not it tastes good and she's like read the label it's not real and he says I don't care if it's real it tastes good and she's like you ain't putting it in this cart and he says fine I'll go find my own cart and I'll just fill it out and she turned around looked at him I don't remember the man's name but it was like Robert you know that tone we all heard that tone our mothers used it sometimes our wife uses it even our daughters and granddaughters use it Robert he looks at her and it's like puts it back but the thing that caught my attention if he didn't care what it was it tasted good so we see here if we go for what just tastes good my brother and sister we're actually would fill this building up if we started only doing what tasted or felt good we'd fill this building up but I I I I won't even look at you so you can raise a hand if you want to but you know uh in that day you know they're going to say didn't we do all of these works and uh he's going to say unto them I never knew you depart from me ye that work in iniquity I think I would much rather hear the words well done well done my good and faithful servant and you say brother Paul where are you going with this I'm telling you we can teach our young people the path that leads them into well done we don't have to sit back and just hope that they will catch a revelation we don't have to sit back and just hope that somehow the world doesn't draw them away my brother and sister there's power in prayer there's power in prayer and if we are concerned enough to call on the Lord cry out to the Lord and seek Him diligently God will hold up his end of the equation can we say Amen to that amen hallelujah now I'm not thinking that there's anybody in our church that's going Wayward or anything like that don't misunderstand me but this is what God laid on my heart and I just have to bring it forth amen so you know he's going to tell him depart from me but he says who so hearth these sayings of mine and doeth them I will liken him to a wise man build your house upon the rock and the rain will come Troubles of life will come the winds will blow things will beat on that house and it will not fail we are God's we are Christ spiritual house amen how do we want to build this house amen I want to build this house so it stands every test that comes in my life and I think I've had tests and trials in my life until I meet other people and and when you meet them and they share their testimony you realize Lord's been really good to me I tell you just if I could make this in a natural sense I was in Home Depot and um yesterday and as I'm exiting the store I my attention is drawn to a man who is walking quite awkwardly the first thing I notice he's walking with another gentleman and the first thing I notice is he raises his hand that it has a pincher on it and I thought oh my that guy you know has lost his arm but then my tensions drawn on the other side is just U what you might say a um I don't know fake hand you realize this this man's lost both arms then my attention is drawn to his walk and it is this very much lopsided gate that it's there and I realized he has no left leg and then my attention is drawn to how he looks and stands and and I thought this this young man's been in the military what a sacrifice what a sacrifice but one thing I I noticed he was a happy man he he was there he had joy in him he wasn't there with a woe begone count and you realize Lord you've been really really good to us now if we can feel that way in the natural my brother and sister how be it that we sit here with a word of the hour that's revealed to us that is guaranteed to deliver our souls to the straight to narrow gate how much more we should be happy we say oh my troubles oh our troubles oh these troubles but we look at this and realize that it don't matter what Satan has done whether Satan's took a bite whether he's left scars whether he's done damage but we have been given the very Breath of Life and it's there that we should take that and say you know what family children everyone around me we are blessed beyond measure because God has looked upon us and we have found favor in his sight and if we take the word now I'm not glossing this over to make it Simplicity but if we take the word and believe the word and act upon the word the word tells tell us that when you believe it and you act upon it you are there as a son or a daughter of God that I've made the way before you we're not earning it we don't have to be slaves to this world we don't have to care about what the world thinks we are Sons and Daughters of God hallelujah maybe some people would think that I make a fool out of myself and I don't mind because it says the foolishness of preaching but as we were there in Canada you know the weekend there I just got right down on the floor making an example of that young woman that had been claimed by by the uh meatpacker son the Rancher's son has claimed her and she's down there on the floor she had a choice Saints she's down there on the floor she could be down there saying I don't think he'll come back I'm down here look who I am I I'm I'm scrubbing the floor look who I am I I I'm just he won't come back for me whoa why was I so foolish to think that he would claim me build a mansion for me come back for me what was I thinking my brother and sister instead while she's being ridiculed she's down on the floor praise God praise God he promised he's coming back he said he's coming back and he's a man of character he's a man that I can trust and I'm going to give myself to him I'm his already he's coming for me we can make that decision which way we want that relationship to be I want to be the Overcomer Lord help me I want to be the one that stands up in the worst of situations and say God's got my back amen he's covering it amen he knows who I am he knows my weakness and he's going to take me anyhow oh hallelujah amen cuz my house Lord help us my house was not built to fall down amen every generation wants a Brad Avenue to Christ look at church life look at the world we live in every generation wants a broader Avenue I don't know how they can get it much broader than it is now be honest with you there's a preacher that I come across a deal about him a man divorced one weekend acknowledg in his church married the next weekend still the pastor how much would you give for a pastor like that I would hope not much but the people stood and applauded him as he introduced the new Ms H Hebrews chapter 6 brother Brown says here paragraph 676 and MDC is a man a man who had no beginning of days or ending of years he had neither father nor mother or descent and we'll find out who he is the Lord willing tonight by the word do you love it oh Thy Thy word is a lamp unto my path and feet oh now you say brother brandom I I don't understand it at all see I love this this makes me feel good as a preacher I don't understand this at all brother Brown neither do I sometimes that kind of helps you where you you just kind of come to a point you're like Lord I I I'm I don't know where we go from here I I don't quite put these pieces together um but one time I was preaching down in Kentucky is this all right this is going to be just a little story but there's a nice little point in there and one time I was preaching down in Kentucky some of the newcomers and Catholic and different ones uh may not understand how these deep rich things of the scripture I'd been preaching on Divine Healing a little barefooted this was might shock some of you a little barefooted girl brought she wasn't 15 years old had a little baby and it was had the py and I said what the matter sister with your baby and said it's got the jerks she didn't know what to say py she didn't know what to call it little thing probably never had a pair of shoes on in her life and some man's darling long hair hanging down and I said Do you believe and them little steel gray eyes looked at me and she said yeah sir I sure believe and I took the little baby and while I was praying for it it quit jerking uh-huh and I went out it went out and next day I was squirrel hunting over on the side of a mountain and I heard some men sitting there talking uh old saw buzzing and I slipped down and been squirrel hunting and they was talking about me I'd SLI down there too what do they got to say is it good or bad yeah don't tell me you wouldn't either yeah yeah I think every one of us had slipped down there and uh sitting there chewing tobacco spitting the leaves flying like that and they were talking about now about the meeting the night before and one of them said I've seen that baby imagine the language that would be there brother Brown's using I I can't even imitate it but it would just be that that uh you know that South I seen that baby I went by there this morning it isn't jerking yet this morning see he said that was real and he was spitting now I hope this doesn't come as too much of a shock but there was a time in school my parents ever figured it out in fact no one in my family figured it out but there was a time I chewed tobacco and I did my best to to hide that from my family and while you know it's eating your teeth and your gums and everything else it's just hard to stop I don't know why must be a spirit attached to it probably not the Holy Spirit they had rifles leaning against a tree so I thought I'd better make myself known you know they have feuds down there so I walked up and said good morning Brethren and that great big fellow seemed to be speaking he had a chew of tobacco in his mouth like that way out in the side like that if you know what that means that means his cheek was bulged out there he had him a great big cut is what he had and like that big long neck and and he had a great big old hat on pulled down over his face and he looked around and seen me he reached up and go that hat jerked it off went brother brandom swallows and swallowed that Chew Tobacco I hope none of you have ever chewed tobacco but I tell you what it takes a cast iron stomach to swallow that old chew tobacco and not just turn green like a fish and can I say it in public puke and this old boy brother Brown says he just swallowed that chewed tobacco and said good morning Parson see yes sir sir respect that's right how he ever lived over it I don't know but he did maybe he turned green right there in front of brother brown but I'm telling you some of that stuff is vicious amen so the next night coming back there was a man there who wanted to argue with me a little bit he went to a church that didn't believe in Divine heal so this was a Methodist Church White Hill Kentucky and he said I was standing outside and he had Lantern in his hand he said I want to say something preacher I just can't accept that cuz I can't see it I said you can't see it he said no I'm a sick man myself but I just can't see it I said where do you live he said back over there on the big renox and I said well how are you going to get home he said well I'm going to walk home and I said can you see your home and he said no sir awful dark tonight it's cloudy he saides and I said how you going home and he said byy this Lantern I said the lantern doesn't show light all the way to the house said how do you go he said oh I walk by the Lantern and I said that's it you got to walk by the Light of the lantern now and every time you step this way the light will keep showing on ahead of you if you just keep walking the light will keep going with you am hallelujah amen we need to teach this to our young people it's not about how dark it is out here or how rough the trail is if the lantern is lit walk by the Light if you know that Christ is a lord and savior A Healer a redeemer our bridegroom don't try to figure it all out just walk with the light of the lantern of the word for our hour we don't need to get complicated and make our kid kids understand the seals at 12 years old or the church ages at 12 years old what they got to understand is Christ is there Illuminating their path of life before them and if they'll just walk in it he'll Shine the Light for them but we get it all complicated I'm sorry I don't want this to offend nobody but we start lecturing because sometimes it's easy for an intellectual to lecture what it should be but what we need is some family some friends a church a pastor that is going to live this gospel and let the light shine and cumulative we'll bring our lick of fire and have a bonfire in this church amen we won't have to have some cold formal religion homework about birthdays and what day of the week was it when this squirrel was shot come on I know churches that teach that to the young people as though that's going to get them in a Rapture I'll tell you what gets them in a rapture knowing Jesus Christ and being filled with the Holy Ghost that's what gets our children gets our families gets the preacher in the Rapture is being filled with the Holy Ghost and knowing Christ on a personal basis hallelujah hallelujah I should have never said a thing about getting out early amen aren't you glad you got a lantern oh thank you Lord we got a lantern oh praise the Lord you know what I I I want to I want to keep this if I launch into this next portion you guys will be looking at the clock saying um it's early for tomorrow brother Paul I'll just put it this way illumination brings Revelation Every Little Rock on that trail was illuminated by that Lantern and every little demon that would try to keep you and I out of the Rapture we'll be illuminated by the word of of God be Shone right on those Devils exposed and they will flee whatever you do young people don't become good at hiding hiding hiding hiding your failures amen get good at confessing and exposing your failures if it mattered within this church on those terms I would say say Church let's have Grace for one another when our failure is exposed don't turn it into conversation turn it into prayer there should not be one in our body that we would say well I don't know what's happening with them and I'm just going to step away from this I don't know I don't know I'm telling you my brother and sister it's time just as I said it's time for us to quit giving EXC excuses to those people that keep presenting this message distorted it is also time for us to quit offering excuse for why we're not digging in and feeding on it and seeing the fruit be raised up amen hallelujah I got quite a bit more here but this will be good sister via if you would come please all our musicians hope it didn't sound like I was railing or preaching to any one person or thought but it just strikes me deep in my heart Lord It's time for Paul to quit making excuses it's time for Grace Tabernacle to quit offering up any kind of excuse It's time for us to teach our children grandchildren how to be Warriors in this gospel how it will come the day if you don't mind this is a little cutting maybe a little criticism I knew some brothers back east and as the young people in their Church come up went off to college every one of those young people Everyone back [Music] Sid and the brothers in their church had a meeting where all the men sat down and they said we have a real issue our children are not surviving out [Music] there and this sounds a little harsh and I I don't mean it to be harsh on this brother this man but one brother piped up and said well I have an easy solution they're all looking for an answer what is it let's just not send them to college sounded good didn't it but then finally there was one little girl 18 19 years old daddy I'm going to go to college oh honey education's of the devil got a quot for it this little girl looked at her Daddy in the face and said Daddy is that really the [Music] answer and the man broke down in tears said no it's not an answer honey it's an excuse that little girl by the grace of God went to the university converted two other little girls to the message brought them back to church what God did was use a little girl for a job the ministry should have done Lord help us because you see we don't need to hide we don't need a back door to life to keep our children from falling we need to get the front door wide open for them to invite Christ and when he moves in and their scriptural the foundation for that right when the house is cleaned and not occupied our our young people they they they're clean as they're going to be as clean being in church raised in church they're going to be as clean as any young people on the face of the Earth but if the house is not occupied what we need is just get the house occupied then they can go and it will be that they can go anywhere that God would send them and God's not going to send them to The Honky Tonks and the back alleys and the trash God's going to send them there but if they're going to go to college go to college with the Holy Ghost they'll come out of college with the Holy Ghost amen and you send them wherever that might be they'll be able to live in that environment and we won't have to offer an excuse to ourself of how to do this now I know what the prophet of God said about education so don't think I'm just blindly stomping along here but I'm telling you my brother and sister in the world we live in today so many people offer an excuse they kept their kids from even going on to uh intermediate or whatever you call it education because they were afraid what would happen but then you got families they send their kids out there boldly and people I've been there I've heard the conversations telling them they're foolish but I tell you what when a daddy knows and a mama knows that their son or their daughter's got the Holy Ghost You're Not Afraid this scripture says what can separate us from the love of God not Peril not sword not nothing my brother and sister we need to do our job God help us and if I have failed this church or these families Lord forgive me but we need to get the word not just indoctrinated into them but the very life if we could it would be that we would take that flame and we would go put it into their life but we can't so the next best thing we can do is show that Christ is real that we can show in this church that God's Alive not a bunch of old sad frowny people that are just waiting for church to get over to go home and play our whatever or do whatever my brother and sister but to have a church that's filled with the Holy Ghost and I believe we are I believe we are I'm not preaching tonight like you guys straighten up we we're no but it's something we need to make it real to the Next Generation hallelujah amen well Hallelujah well let's stand and sing a song or two I
