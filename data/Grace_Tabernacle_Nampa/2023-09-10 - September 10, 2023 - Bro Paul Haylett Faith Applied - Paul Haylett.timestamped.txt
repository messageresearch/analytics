[44:38] little things just touch you and you say

[48:04] Lord this orchestrated that you'd have a
[48:06] full house
[48:07] amen and that's just beautiful thing
[48:11] the Lord just allowed him to have a
[48:13] birthday party and attract people from
[48:15] all over to be there and to be a part of
[48:18] that and the Lord knows amen just as he
[48:21] knows how to draw his bride from the
[48:24] four corners of the earth amen he knew
[48:27] each one of us would be here today and
[48:30] he knew what it would be as it would be
[48:33] for last weekend amen and we thank God
[48:36] for that amen Hallelujah I want to speak
[48:39] to you this morning on the measure of
[48:43] faith
[48:44] amen and
[48:47] Faith applied
[48:49] and so as we look at this my brother and
[48:51] sister we'll just turn to Romans the
[48:54] 12th chapter and uh in that we can just
[48:58] draw we'll start to draw our thought for
[49:01] the day amen
[49:03] Romans 12 1-5 amen it's good to see each
[49:07] and every one of you I know that there
[49:09] are some obviously some traveling some
[49:12] gone some sick I know brother Sergey I
[49:15] saw him yesterday and talked to him for
[49:17] just a moment and he sounded pretty
[49:20] rough and so we just pray Lord would
[49:23] just be with them and my daughter and
[49:26] grandchildren and anyone else that we
[49:29] might have missed that's not well today
[49:30] we just pray God's hand of Mercy those
[49:33] are not here Lord just be with them amen
[49:37] Romans 12 1-5
[49:40] I beseech yeed therefore brother
[49:43] I I beseech you therefore
[49:46] pause comma brother in specific who he's
[49:50] talking to
[49:51] by the mercies of God that you present
[49:54] your bodies a Living Sacrifice
[49:58] and be not conformed to this world
[50:01] oh my I'm just I'm having a hard time
[50:04] reading this morning
[50:05] let me start over here with my glasses
[50:07] off
[50:08] I beseech you therefore Brethren by the
[50:11] mercies of God that you presents your
[50:13] bodies a Living Sacrifice holy
[50:15] acceptable unto God which is your
[50:18] reasonable service and we can make an
[50:21] emphasis on reasonable and be not
[50:23] conformed to this world but be ye
[50:25] transformed by the renewing of your mind
[50:27] that ye may prove what is that good and
[50:30] acceptable and perfect pause
[50:33] will of God
[50:37] for I say through the grace given unto
[50:40] me to every man that is among you not to
[50:42] think of himself more highly than he
[50:44] ought to think but to think soberly
[50:46] according as God has dealt to every man
[50:50] The Measure of Faith for as we have many
[50:54] members in one body and all members have
[50:56] not the same office so we being many are
[50:59] one body in Christ and every one members
[51:02] one of another
[51:05] Heavenly Father we just ask you Lord to
[51:07] come just open your word to us Lord this
[51:10] deal father in the flesh and the body
[51:13] father of those who are not well today
[51:15] maybe hear or absent Lord those who by
[51:19] circumstance Lord are not here we just
[51:22] certainly father ask you to just deal
[51:25] kindly with each one all of the prayer
[51:27] requests father seems like we always
[51:29] miss someone or something but father you
[51:32] know the needs of this body Lord you
[51:34] know the needs of your body the bride of
[51:37] Christ and Lord we just ask you to come
[51:39] and and just touch each one of those
[51:41] needs father and Lord encourage and give
[51:44] strength father give direction and
[51:46] wisdom father give Revelation and Lord
[51:49] we'll ask you to come this morning and
[51:51] open the word of God lord beyond what
[51:53] our human comprehension but open the
[51:55] word of God to us father that we can
[51:57] walk out today Lord Just a Little Closer
[52:00] to You Lord a little encouraged Lord a
[52:03] little strengthened father whatever is
[52:05] necessary in this body that the vitamin
[52:08] of the word come down into watch each
[52:10] Soul father we thank you for this
[52:13] opportunity to come today and we bless
[52:15] you father and we thank you for your
[52:17] blessings your grace upon us we ask in
[52:20] the name of Jesus Christ amen you may be
[52:23] seated
[52:29] as we look at this today I think as we
[52:32] would take and just look at verse 2 for
[52:35] a moment it's a kind of single that out
[52:38] you might say and to to look at that for
[52:41] a moment it is there my brother and
[52:43] sister that it tells us not to be
[52:46] conformed to this world and so if we're
[52:49] going to correctly apply the word of God
[52:52] to our lives we we have to actually stop
[52:55] and take it now I'm just going to term
[52:57] it this way if you if you would follow
[53:00] me we have to take it literally from
[53:03] semicolon to comma to semicolon to comma
[53:07] we can't just go and brush our way
[53:09] through the word and say well that was
[53:10] good it's God's word but you see God is
[53:13] wanting to come in one portion of the
[53:15] scripture one one portion of a verse
[53:18] would complement my brother and sister
[53:20] it is there what unfolds that and there
[53:24] are many keys but there's only certain
[53:26] keys that unlock the gospel amen and and
[53:29] that's why you know when God gave the
[53:31] keys to Peter amen and told him you know
[53:35] to go and take that my brother and
[53:37] sister there were those who
[53:39] misinterpreted that and thought that it
[53:40] was like that he held the key but the
[53:43] key was Revelation and the key that was
[53:46] given my brother and sister was not a
[53:48] key just for that day that season not
[53:51] even for that church age but it was for
[53:53] Time and Eternity and when eternity is
[53:56] still unfolding my brother and sister
[53:57] the keys will still be working amen and
[54:02] so you say well will we need more
[54:04] Revelation when we when we get to the
[54:06] other sign well I believe we will be
[54:09] receiving more Revelation as we get
[54:11] there because God is unfolding himself
[54:14] and so as it's there that we receive
[54:17] that and so you know he he says here not
[54:20] to be conformed to this world and I want
[54:23] to just focus for a minute how easy it
[54:26] is actually to be conformed
[54:29] how easy it is that we as humans and I
[54:33] know when I was a young man in high
[54:34] school I struggled with kind of what you
[54:37] might say was a dual identity
[54:40] I I really as a young man I wanted to
[54:42] serve God but there was struggles you
[54:46] might say in the church at that time and
[54:48] I did not identify with those struggles
[54:50] and it seemed like the world over here
[54:52] just come in and filled that little void
[54:55] that was there and I found myself as a
[54:57] Young Man conforming to the things of
[55:00] the world and you know it was like you
[55:02] get off the school bus you know and uh
[55:05] when you went out of the house in the
[55:07] morning you know you had your hair had
[55:09] to be combed you know my parents were
[55:12] were not super fussy but you know they
[55:14] kind of said hey look you know you need
[55:16] to look a certain way my hair was combed
[55:18] my shirt was tucked in by the time I got
[55:20] off the school bus at the high school my
[55:23] hair looked like I'd been through a
[55:24] tornado and my shirt was untucked and
[55:27] sleeves sloppily rolled up because that
[55:29] was what the fashion of the day was and
[55:33] I was conforming into the fashion
[55:36] and when I got off the school bus at the
[55:38] end of the day in front of my house
[55:41] well I couldn't do much for my hair but
[55:44] my shirt was tucked in and my sleeves
[55:46] were rolled down and buttoned up you see
[55:49] I knew and the scripture tells us that
[55:51] if we know when we don't do it that to
[55:54] us it's iniquity it's actually sin and
[55:56] so I was nothing more than a sinner
[56:00] that had an understanding that there was
[56:02] something greater than what I saw
[56:05] at the time something greater than I
[56:07] felt like I could live or was compelled
[56:11] to live
[56:12] but that did not take away that there
[56:15] was something greater there and so we
[56:19] want to correctly apply the word and and
[56:21] so by not being conformed to the world
[56:23] but if we allow ourselves to be
[56:26] transformed now my brother and sister
[56:28] there's many Transformations take place
[56:30] but we are not here my brother and
[56:33] sister to to take a World's idea you
[56:37] know you go into a bookstore and you go
[56:41] to the self-help section isn't it
[56:43] amazing that a bookstore will actually
[56:45] have a whole section that is about you
[56:48] helping yourself
[56:50] now if they would just go ahead and have
[56:52] a section that said God helping you
[56:56] and filled it full of Bibles it would
[56:58] make a difference in life but what do
[57:00] they do they come to a place and promote
[57:03] the idea the transforming of your
[57:05] thinking that I can change me but my
[57:08] brother and sister the truth is very few
[57:10] people are actually successful at
[57:13] changing themselves and usually it's a
[57:15] superficial thing they're changing my
[57:18] brother and sister you know what it does
[57:20] is I read a book one time the guy very
[57:22] candid and he said you know I I was uh
[57:25] kind of into dabbling the social drugs
[57:27] and alcohol and and you know I started
[57:30] reading these self-help books and he
[57:32] said you know I I I quit the smoking
[57:35] cigarettes and drinking and and the
[57:37] recreational drugs and I just replaced
[57:40] that addiction with another one
[57:44] that was more acceptable
[57:48] what we are looking as we've sung in the
[57:51] songs this morning we're looking
[57:53] for renewing of our minds
[57:56] amen what is that taking our mind back
[57:58] to what it was before it got muddied up
[58:01] and perverted and and all the trash
[58:04] dumped out upon that he says they be
[58:07] transformed by the Renewing Your Mind
[58:08] that ye may prove what is that good and
[58:11] acceptable and perfect will of God and
[58:13] so my brother and sister to correctly
[58:15] apply the word we're going to have to
[58:17] change our thinking
[58:19] amen it's not a self-help book it's not
[58:22] it's not me gonna just oh I'm going to
[58:24] think positive thoughts think positive
[58:27] thought there must be a change in our
[58:28] thinking but not a psychology type
[58:31] change of our thinking amen it's not a
[58:34] psychology type thing that you know mind
[58:37] over matter as it is but yet you will
[58:39] find as a son or daughter of God that
[58:42] you have to think in the right vein
[58:44] because wherever our mind is at we will
[58:49] go
[58:52] if our mind is on money we'll go
[58:55] speaking to the youth group amen nothing
[58:58] wrong with prosperity but the scripture
[59:01] clearly shows us that our prosperity
[59:03] must be in Christ and then it will also
[59:06] be in the natural amen when Prosperity
[59:10] is Just only in the natural my brother
[59:12] and sister we can be a corrupt
[59:15] I won't even go there it's all negative
[59:17] but we can be so corrupt and have
[59:20] Prosperity but when you prosper in Jesus
[59:23] Christ amen then your business and your
[59:26] life will be lined up and be correct
[59:28] amen you don't have to worry about well
[59:31] you have as it were an enemy but God has
[59:35] taken care of that so as we are having a
[59:38] change in our thinking it starts to come
[59:40] and we're changing from the old man
[59:42] isn't that beautiful that we can change
[59:44] but you know what the old man came to
[59:46] church with us this morning the old man
[59:49] was aggravated at the car who come to
[59:51] the four-way after you and cuts you off
[59:55] and goes on and that bothers us still
[59:57] that's the old man but we're looking for
[1:00:00] renewing from that where you can look at
[1:00:03] that and as brother Branham talked about
[1:00:05] the little waitress that was doing so
[1:00:07] poorly we're not going to leave a tip
[1:00:09] for them and he says no no she's having
[1:00:11] a rough time you need to give you need
[1:00:14] to help her our thinking my brother and
[1:00:16] sister is so in the thinking of the old
[1:00:19] man that we don't often think about what
[1:00:23] any other circumstance might be and so
[1:00:26] we look at this now as we're moving
[1:00:29] forward on this
[1:00:31] where does our doubt come from
[1:00:37] it doesn't come from the new man
[1:00:41] it doesn't come to one who's been
[1:00:42] transformed
[1:00:44] our doubts and our fears
[1:00:47] come from the old man
[1:00:49] it comes from the man that's under the
[1:00:52] influence of the Fall
[1:00:54] it comes from the man that can only see
[1:00:56] what is directly in front of him you
[1:00:59] know there has been down in many many
[1:01:01] aspects of History we just go into this
[1:01:04] first second in any aspects of History
[1:01:06] whether it was science or different
[1:01:09] things there would be terms there would
[1:01:11] be men and women that would be called
[1:01:13] visionary
[1:01:15] and they looked beyond what the present
[1:01:18] was and they saw something greater and
[1:01:21] and they stepped out and pursued this
[1:01:23] other vision and and they look back in
[1:01:26] time and say you know they were a person
[1:01:28] born before their time or they were
[1:01:30] Visionary my brother and sister I'll
[1:01:33] tell you there's a bride on the Earth
[1:01:34] today that God has blessed and she is
[1:01:37] visionary she's not looking in this
[1:01:40] circumstance in this world right here
[1:01:42] does not dictate to her who she is and
[1:01:45] what her life will be but she's looking
[1:01:48] Beyond the Veil into the word and
[1:01:50] realizing oh this old man is still here
[1:01:54] but he's not my destiny he's not going
[1:01:58] to control who I am and I say God help
[1:02:01] you and I today to be Visionaries Amen
[1:02:04] to be able to catch the vision of the
[1:02:06] word for the hour not to be caught up
[1:02:09] that this is how I was raised this is a
[1:02:11] circumstance of my life then I'm going
[1:02:13] to be as it were my brother and sister
[1:02:15] you'll mind I was just looking at some
[1:02:17] stuff concerning Haiti heartbreaking
[1:02:19] circumstances and there is there in
[1:02:22] Haiti and they're talking to people in
[1:02:24] the slums and they are telling them
[1:02:26] nothing will ever change for me or my
[1:02:29] children or my children's children this
[1:02:32] is our future
[1:02:39] will they make progress
[1:02:42] to change
[1:02:44] their position
[1:02:50] but on the other side of Port-au-Prince
[1:02:54] is a family that says
[1:02:57] we're going to change
[1:03:01] and when the schools was doing nothing
[1:03:03] but a Congregation of kids and violent
[1:03:06] acts and gangs
[1:03:08] they said we'll teach our own children
[1:03:11] when they couldn't get food in the
[1:03:13] marketplace they said we'll grow our own
[1:03:19] and when our children leave the door
[1:03:23] their hair will be combed
[1:03:25] and their shirt
[1:03:27] will be tucked in
[1:03:28] because
[1:03:30] you will identify with you
[1:03:38] follow me
[1:03:44] so
[1:03:46] the old man is where doubt come from and
[1:03:48] why is it my brother and sister that
[1:03:50] when we come face to face with things of
[1:03:52] the word
[1:03:54] then oftentimes the very thing that
[1:03:56] comes to us first of the preaching of
[1:03:58] the word the reading of the word the
[1:03:59] hearing of the word and there's a doubt
[1:04:01] that slips in maybe it might be in the
[1:04:03] form of I've tried to live that but I
[1:04:06] can't seem to live it I I maybe I can't
[1:04:09] live it and and so why is it that always
[1:04:12] there's the negative comes in first it
[1:04:15] like floods in on us and and we're
[1:04:17] fighting and pushing back we'll hear the
[1:04:19] word being preached amen we're more than
[1:04:22] conquerors and we'll be thinking yeah
[1:04:24] well I wasn't a conqueror here I was in
[1:04:26] a conqueror here I wasn't a conqueror
[1:04:28] here I love the fact that Brother David
[1:04:30] brings out and when he come up to pray
[1:04:32] amen if our heart condemns us not amen
[1:04:36] but you see there's a side that comes in
[1:04:39] that we have been trained and schooled
[1:04:41] in such a fashion that because of the
[1:04:44] Fall we'll take it all the way back
[1:04:45] there we come and find ourselves having
[1:04:48] doubts and fears as some of the first
[1:04:51] things that rise up
[1:04:55] if you believe and don't doubt you can
[1:04:57] move this mountain
[1:05:00] and yet no heart
[1:05:02] we would say
[1:05:05] I I don't think I can move them out
[1:05:09] in our heart we'll battle with certain
[1:05:11] circumstances over and over and over
[1:05:13] again sometimes decades go by still
[1:05:16] battling this same battle and it's there
[1:05:18] that there's always that but why is it
[1:05:21] that we doubt first and then by God's
[1:05:24] grace we start pressing into the battle
[1:05:26] and slowly start claiming the victory
[1:05:29] when we could have stood in the very
[1:05:32] beginning and said victory is mine
[1:05:36] Satan get behind me but often that
[1:05:39] nature of humanity brings us in to the
[1:05:42] position here and then we battle to
[1:05:45] claim the victory
[1:05:47] we get the victory
[1:05:49] can we say Amen to that we can claim the
[1:05:52] victory but why is it we must battle is
[1:05:55] it the doubts of the world out here is
[1:05:57] it the doubts of the drunkard in the
[1:05:58] alley is it in the doubts of this person
[1:06:00] here and that person there it's our own
[1:06:03] doubts we must battle through our own
[1:06:07] doubt
[1:06:09] many a young person hope young people
[1:06:11] don't mind me preaching it this way this
[1:06:13] morning many young person finds
[1:06:15] themselves out in the world of the
[1:06:17] influence where people can just live any
[1:06:19] old way they want almost flippantly say
[1:06:22] oh I offended you I'm sorry and they
[1:06:24] just go on without a care it seems and
[1:06:26] here's a young man and a young woman
[1:06:28] wanting to serve God called of God and
[1:06:31] it seems like such a battle while the
[1:06:33] rest of the world lives Carefree
[1:06:36] but God called you
[1:06:38] to rise up
[1:06:40] maybe the doubt is there
[1:06:43] maybe the fear is there but God called
[1:06:45] you rise up and possess the land my
[1:06:49] brother and sister when Israel come in
[1:06:51] the days of Moses and then coming into
[1:06:53] the leadership of Joshua my brother and
[1:06:56] sister doubt would have been palatable
[1:06:58] doubt would have been you could have cut
[1:07:01] it with a knife doubt would have been so
[1:07:03] present amongst the people that it would
[1:07:05] be just seemingly as though it was a
[1:07:08] doctrine of Israel to doubt
[1:07:11] but God come and said I'm going to
[1:07:13] change this and he starts to speak to
[1:07:15] Joshua and he tells Joshua everything
[1:07:19] that I have promised my servant Moses
[1:07:23] you will bring it to pass my brother and
[1:07:26] sister everything the God promised to
[1:07:28] our prophet of the day and the word that
[1:07:30] come has come and many things people say
[1:07:33] the doubters say well that didn't come
[1:07:35] to pass that didn't come to pass did God
[1:07:37] put an expiration on it did God put a
[1:07:40] time lapse on it God put his time on it
[1:07:45] amen and a god of Eternity is not bound
[1:07:47] by days weeks months or years but he's
[1:07:51] Bound by I'm looking as we sang the song
[1:07:53] This Morning amen he looked down into
[1:07:56] eternity and says I see you and there's
[1:07:59] where you are not here not in this it's
[1:08:03] there but we're over here fighting our
[1:08:05] doubt we're fighting our fears
[1:08:08] and we're struggling
[1:08:10] amen now I hope you don't mind that I
[1:08:13] just kind of take this in a stronger
[1:08:15] fashion
[1:08:16] we take this correct position right in
[1:08:19] verse two he said me transformed by the
[1:08:21] renew of your mind that ye may prove
[1:08:25] you realize what our job is doing you
[1:08:27] hear my brother and sister we're proving
[1:08:30] amen we're proving the word of God you
[1:08:34] say but it's not me it's Christ in me
[1:08:36] amen Christ is in there he's proving it
[1:08:39] and we can stand here in this hour oh my
[1:08:42] brother and sister sometimes we find
[1:08:44] ourselves still struggling but God is
[1:08:46] proving what is good amen he's proving
[1:08:49] what is acceptable he is proving what is
[1:08:51] perfect it's his will
[1:08:54] amen and we are the manifestation of
[1:08:57] God's will because we cannot live in
[1:08:59] this life
[1:09:00] out of the will of God
[1:09:02] and expect to walk in his Blessing
[1:09:06] it's pretty simple
[1:09:10] walk in his will
[1:09:11] and he promised to bless us
[1:09:15] now blessing us
[1:09:18] is not
[1:09:21] is not
[1:09:24] a new shiny Corvette
[1:09:27] sister Jerry and I went to pick up a car
[1:09:30] at the mechanic shop
[1:09:32] and the previous owner which is the dad
[1:09:35] of our mechanic
[1:09:37] had this brand new Corvette sitting
[1:09:40] there in front of it and
[1:09:41] I looked at that you know there was a
[1:09:43] time in my life how can I be just blunt
[1:09:45] I lusted after those things
[1:09:49] oh I'm gonna own a Corvette one day
[1:09:52] but maybe it's the old creaky bones that
[1:09:54] you realize you've got to sit down this
[1:09:56] far off the ground
[1:09:57] then you've got to crawl out of that
[1:10:00] and I had a friend one day went and test
[1:10:02] drove one of them new modern sport type
[1:10:04] cars and he went to get out of it and he
[1:10:07] said I had to roll out on the ground
[1:10:10] and then stand up he says can you
[1:10:12] imagine
[1:10:14] honey we're gonna go out for dinner oh
[1:10:16] we look so cool as you roll out in the
[1:10:19] puddle at the parking lot
[1:10:22] my brother and sister you see God
[1:10:23] changes us
[1:10:25] and what we used to think was normal for
[1:10:28] our life and necessary for our life God
[1:10:30] is changing us because his perfect will
[1:10:33] and his will is not the world
[1:10:36] his will is his word
[1:10:38] and so God is proving his word in this
[1:10:42] hour through you and I if God did not
[1:10:44] want to use you and I some people
[1:10:46] believe no no that was for the prophet
[1:10:47] that's for this that's for that it
[1:10:49] really we're just the minions my brother
[1:10:51] and sister if that was the truth then
[1:10:53] God would have manifested all of the
[1:10:55] word of God through them but God is
[1:10:58] sitting here waiting for you and I to
[1:11:00] get out of our fear to get out of our
[1:11:02] doubt and come and say you know what
[1:11:04] this is worth fighting for this is worth
[1:11:06] standing up for and I'm going to
[1:11:09] amen and if you have to stand in front
[1:11:11] of the mirror and convince yourself on
[1:11:13] that then I say find a nice big mirror
[1:11:15] and stand there till you believe it amen
[1:11:18] now what is it we are going to prove the
[1:11:22] word
[1:11:23] amen the will
[1:11:25] is the word we're going to prove the
[1:11:28] word now you hear it all the time my
[1:11:31] brother and sister whether it's people
[1:11:32] that were around the message still
[1:11:33] around the message that have doubts and
[1:11:35] fears or just simply denominational
[1:11:37] Spirits you hear a common phraseology
[1:11:39] and and sometimes you we got to be
[1:11:42] careful about not taking the verbage and
[1:11:44] applying it directly it might just be
[1:11:46] words but many times you'll see that
[1:11:48] there's a point that they come and they
[1:11:50] say well the the bride of Christ is
[1:11:52] supposed to do this
[1:11:54] but somehow or another they withdraw
[1:11:56] themselves from that position as though
[1:11:59] it's another group of people maybe more
[1:12:01] spiritual than them that are going to
[1:12:03] fulfill that portion of the word of God
[1:12:05] my brother and sister the Bride As we
[1:12:08] read here this many membered body amen
[1:12:11] that we're all a member of is going to
[1:12:14] fulfill the word of God Amen it's not
[1:12:16] left for someone else it's not left for
[1:12:19] another time or season it's not left for
[1:12:21] a more spiritual people it's left to a
[1:12:24] people that make mistakes daily and have
[1:12:26] to repent daily it's mistakes that are
[1:12:30] made by people that the first instinct
[1:12:32] is I I need to pray for this person but
[1:12:35] would God hear my prayer maybe maybe I
[1:12:38] was just a little upset or angry or
[1:12:40] fussed or whatever here and would God
[1:12:42] hear my prayer because of that
[1:12:45] and those doubts start to come
[1:12:49] and then
[1:12:50] a still small voice
[1:12:58] I don't know if I go into music or not
[1:13:03] let's just put it this way
[1:13:05] volume does not equal
[1:13:08] anointing
[1:13:12] just because it's loud
[1:13:15] doesn't mean it's real
[1:13:18] amen
[1:13:19] now so he says here I want to dissect
[1:13:22] this another way
[1:13:24] that ye may prove
[1:13:28] what is that good
[1:13:30] now the word May
[1:13:32] means expression of possibility
[1:13:38] you see how God lets his word be brought
[1:13:40] in such a fashion
[1:13:42] that you can decide whether May means
[1:13:45] absolute
[1:13:46] or remote
[1:13:50] possibility
[1:13:53] we're sitting here this morning
[1:13:54] believing it's a remote possibility that
[1:13:56] we fulfill the word of God
[1:13:58] then you will only remotely try
[1:14:03] but if you are here today and read it
[1:14:05] like Paul reads it I am going to prove
[1:14:10] amen I'm not going to just try to prove
[1:14:12] I am going to prove and if doubt comes
[1:14:15] up first I will battle my way through
[1:14:17] doubt if fear comes up I will battle my
[1:14:20] way through fear if the enemy comes and
[1:14:22] stands before me I will battle my way
[1:14:25] through the enemy because I was called
[1:14:27] to prove the word of God
[1:14:29] and I will prove it amen Our God's an
[1:14:33] on-time God can we say Amen to that and
[1:14:36] so this bride is not just a possibility
[1:14:38] do you read anywhere in the word of God
[1:14:40] where it says they'll possibly be a
[1:14:41] bride take a rapture
[1:14:43] no sir it very clearly states it as an
[1:14:46] emphatic fact that there is going to be
[1:14:49] a people that he says we're not a people
[1:14:52] but are now my people and I'm going to
[1:14:54] expand that a little farther there was a
[1:14:57] people that didn't really have faith but
[1:15:00] now have my faith they don't have their
[1:15:03] own faith they don't have their own
[1:15:05] ability it's him amen and he is there
[1:15:09] telling him you are going to take my
[1:15:12] faith and you're going to release it and
[1:15:15] you are going to bring this to pass
[1:15:18] Hallelujah because I tell you what every
[1:15:22] time I've tried to do something on my
[1:15:24] own I think I've got it figured out
[1:15:26] Hallelujah
[1:15:28] amen I'm probably the little kid on the
[1:15:32] bicycle
[1:15:33] riding along there instead looking at
[1:15:35] the end like I should have been many
[1:15:37] times we're like hey everybody see how
[1:15:39] good I'm doing
[1:15:42] and then we crash
[1:15:44] and then the Devil comes and says see
[1:15:46] you're not even a Christian
[1:15:49] and we identify with that
[1:15:52] but then we have to push our way back
[1:15:54] through that
[1:15:55] and realize no I am
[1:15:58] I just allowed the world to distract me
[1:16:09] you know
[1:16:11] God's more gracious than this world is
[1:16:16] policemen following you you cross over
[1:16:18] the white line three times he pulls you
[1:16:20] over and gives you a ticket for
[1:16:21] distracted driving
[1:16:24] God allows you to cross over the line
[1:16:26] many times
[1:16:29] and then he just keeps reminding you get
[1:16:32] back in mind get back in life
[1:16:35] now as we look at this I need to hurry
[1:16:37] on
[1:16:38] amen see we're not just a possibility
[1:16:40] the word says we're already been made
[1:16:42] more than conquerors can we say Amen to
[1:16:44] that today amen now look what the word
[1:16:47] does is we read the Bible with any kind
[1:16:50] of revelation we realize amen the Bible
[1:16:53] proves that we recall
[1:16:55] amen we should not one of us be sitting
[1:16:57] here this morning with a doubt that it's
[1:16:59] God that's calling us amen and so if the
[1:17:03] world's calling you my brother and
[1:17:04] sister you'll find you know I I knew
[1:17:07] this individual I know this individual
[1:17:09] and uh you know I hadn't seen him for a
[1:17:12] while and when I run into them the next
[1:17:14] time they've got a tattoo from their
[1:17:16] wrist bone all the way up to their
[1:17:18] collarbone and and uh you know Paul
[1:17:20] being so diplomatic like I am I just
[1:17:23] said um you realize you just poisoned
[1:17:25] half to your liver
[1:17:27] and he's like what are you talking about
[1:17:29] and I said the ink from that tattoo your
[1:17:31] body's trying to digest that ink
[1:17:34] oh it can't be a big deal or else they
[1:17:36] would have told me
[1:17:40] do you see the devil putting disclaimers
[1:17:42] on everything
[1:17:44] no sir he glamorizes and glorifies and
[1:17:48] blows it up in neon lights my brother
[1:17:51] and sister the devil has put the warning
[1:17:54] in so fine a print you can't read it and
[1:17:57] he focuses everything away from that but
[1:18:00] what does God do he comes and gives us
[1:18:02] the whole picture amen
[1:18:07] and I could elaborate onto this but I
[1:18:09] don't want us to be too long today amen
[1:18:12] so the word of God proves that we're
[1:18:14] called amen it proves that we've been
[1:18:17] redeemed by the blood amen these These
[1:18:20] are the the unbeliever my brother and
[1:18:22] sister he might say it proves nothing
[1:18:24] well that's because his eyes are closed
[1:18:26] he's not behind the veil and the word
[1:18:28] proves that every tenet it proves every
[1:18:31] tenet of Christianity
[1:18:33] do you realize my brother and sister
[1:18:35] there's even Muslim uh theologians if
[1:18:38] you'd call them whatever they they term
[1:18:40] their holy men that acknowledge that the
[1:18:44] Bible expounds
[1:18:47] on the basic tenets of life
[1:18:49] much greater
[1:18:51] than their writings
[1:18:54] their writings
[1:18:56] are all rules
[1:19:00] the Bible
[1:19:02] is life
[1:19:04] you read every line and if you read it
[1:19:06] as rules you need to read it again
[1:19:09] amen need to pray for understanding
[1:19:18] and the Lord is using you
[1:19:21] to do it
[1:19:23] why didn't he
[1:19:25] have some great holy man
[1:19:28] the impeccable life the Untouchable life
[1:19:32] the life so far above reproach
[1:19:37] but God says you know what I'm going to
[1:19:39] use you I'm going to let you prove my
[1:19:42] word
[1:19:43] I'm going to let you and I've said this
[1:19:44] many times here in the church and I
[1:19:46] believe it with all of my heart my
[1:19:47] brother and sister it was not the signs
[1:19:49] and wonders people argue over these
[1:19:51] things it was not the signs and wonders
[1:19:53] and discernments of the Prophet that
[1:19:54] Vindicated his ministry I'm convinced of
[1:19:57] this it is you sitting here today living
[1:20:00] out what he preached and how he opened
[1:20:03] the word of God and there's a living
[1:20:05] testimony of what he said this word will
[1:20:08] produce my brother and sister there was
[1:20:10] many preachers in those days that
[1:20:12] discern the Hearts and Spirits and
[1:20:13] called out and there was healings and
[1:20:15] all of those things right because we
[1:20:17] recognized as it was the whole deal
[1:20:19] about the fishing and the line and all
[1:20:21] of that we realize what happened there
[1:20:23] but you look at that and say okay now I
[1:20:25] just challenge you to go study this and
[1:20:30] find who or what they produced
[1:20:35] find what they produce today
[1:20:39] many churches I won't call out names but
[1:20:41] we've been rubbed elbows with for years
[1:20:44] and now today
[1:20:46] they're just they allowed this they
[1:20:48] don't want this group to leave they've
[1:20:50] allowed this they don't want that group
[1:20:51] to leave allow this allow this allow
[1:20:54] this
[1:20:55] my brother and sister it's all around us
[1:20:58] almost every religion that ever had the
[1:21:00] name Holiness associated with it is no
[1:21:02] longer holiness
[1:21:05] but the bride adorned in the word is not
[1:21:08] moving to the world
[1:21:10] but she's moving to Christ her wedding
[1:21:12] day has come she's standing there in the
[1:21:15] presence of God and she wants to look
[1:21:17] her best I'm telling you there's not
[1:21:19] much of a bride that would come into the
[1:21:22] church to get married that day in a
[1:21:25] ratty wedding gown
[1:21:28] she decided to go for a jog in the park
[1:21:31] she decided to go walk down the alleys
[1:21:33] of that's it no my brother and sister
[1:21:35] there's something wrong with that so we
[1:21:37] look and see how this bride of Christ
[1:21:39] she is concerned about the very smudge
[1:21:42] on the Hem of her garment not going the
[1:21:45] other way how much can I cut away of my
[1:21:47] garment
[1:21:49] but how do I keep my garment clean amen
[1:21:53] so it's there the Lord asks you to do it
[1:21:56] now this is God's will
[1:21:59] and I've got it right here for you in
[1:22:00] case you don't know what his will is
[1:22:03] many times Saints I just want to put it
[1:22:04] out to you kind of strong today
[1:22:07] many times
[1:22:09] we come ask the preacher
[1:22:12] I need an answer
[1:22:15] if we actually just stop
[1:22:18] ask the Lord to show us pick up our
[1:22:21] Bible
[1:22:21] start reading
[1:22:23] you'll find the answer
[1:22:27] God put Ministry God put men as as help
[1:22:29] and and these kind of things but I'm
[1:22:32] telling you how thorough God's plan
[1:22:33] works is that if we will pray and read
[1:22:36] our Bible that we will be led right to
[1:22:39] the answer to our problem
[1:22:50] do we have doubts sometimes
[1:22:55] let's all be honest
[1:22:58] we have doubts
[1:23:02] you know it's interesting
[1:23:06] I was thinking about this the other day
[1:23:10] When We Were Young
[1:23:14] I seen a little video clip of some young
[1:23:16] men it's back east
[1:23:19] in a church group outing
[1:23:22] these young men are scrambling up these
[1:23:24] rocks like mountain goats
[1:23:28] and somebody at the bottom they never
[1:23:30] did show them but I can only assume that
[1:23:32] they probably were a little older
[1:23:35] be careful
[1:23:36] laughs
[1:23:38] as these young men scramble up the rocks
[1:23:41] and it took me back in time
[1:23:43] I used to do that
[1:23:46] now I just stand at the bottom
[1:23:49] be careful
[1:23:55] because you see we come into a place
[1:23:57] if we're not careful
[1:23:59] if we don't conquer fear
[1:24:01] fear conquers us
[1:24:06] and if we don't conquer doubts
[1:24:09] then doubt Will Conquer us
[1:24:15] reminds me I know this kind of blunt
[1:24:17] forgive me for putting it this way but
[1:24:19] a gentleman that I've known some what
[1:24:21] for many years
[1:24:23] said well I always had doubts about the
[1:24:25] message
[1:24:27] and it struck me
[1:24:29] that's why today
[1:24:31] you believe half of it's true and half
[1:24:33] of its false because you never dealt
[1:24:35] with the doubts
[1:24:36] back here
[1:24:38] they stayed there
[1:24:41] and when we allow doubt to grow
[1:24:44] doubt doesn't just stay at church
[1:24:50] doubt comes along and says I probably
[1:24:52] made a mistake here I probably made a
[1:24:54] mistake here and you'll see people
[1:24:56] radically change their lives make just
[1:24:59] ridiculous decisions
[1:25:02] and it all comes back to a doubt
[1:25:05] because they doubt it
[1:25:07] what God did for them in the beginning
[1:25:10] that's right
[1:25:12] amen
[1:25:14] we read of the promises and sometimes we
[1:25:17] struggle a little bit as I referenced
[1:25:20] speaking to the mountain
[1:25:22] my brother and sister I remember a
[1:25:24] brother one time said you know I just
[1:25:25] don't know about that scripture I don't
[1:25:27] think it applies to us because I was out
[1:25:29] in the woods one time and I just I was
[1:25:32] there and I just said okay Mountain be
[1:25:33] moved
[1:25:35] come on mountain move
[1:25:37] I'm waiting God for this mountain to
[1:25:39] move
[1:25:41] it never moved
[1:25:45] but the problem is
[1:25:47] he was amiss
[1:25:51] he was trying to make God prove
[1:25:54] his word
[1:25:57] is God to be mocked
[1:26:00] no
[1:26:02] but you see to approach it that way
[1:26:04] there had to be a doubt somewhere in the
[1:26:07] recesses of the mind that this would
[1:26:10] really apply I like how brother Donnie
[1:26:12] Reagan put it
[1:26:14] he said now you could go out today we
[1:26:16] could dismiss church and we'd go find us
[1:26:17] a mountain over here somewhere if you
[1:26:19] can find one in Tennessee and
[1:26:21] um you know we go out there and tell the
[1:26:23] mountain to be moved and nothing's going
[1:26:25] to happen
[1:26:27] and many people are going to walk away
[1:26:28] and say even our pastor tell the
[1:26:30] mountain to move and it didn't move but
[1:26:32] brother Donnie says you come in a time
[1:26:33] of need
[1:26:35] you come in a time that is important and
[1:26:38] you're sincere and you would speak to
[1:26:41] this mountain
[1:26:43] oh it's figurative
[1:26:45] maybe it is figurative
[1:26:47] but if you needed to move a real
[1:26:49] mountain and you were desperate
[1:26:51] and you spoke to it in the name of Jesus
[1:26:53] Christ I personally believe the mountain
[1:26:56] will move
[1:26:59] but as long as we come with a doubt
[1:27:02] a question mark
[1:27:04] that right there just nullifies
[1:27:06] everything
[1:27:08] you know my brother and sister a lot of
[1:27:10] examples we could give and all of them
[1:27:12] take time
[1:27:14] but you look at this
[1:27:17] the word in you
[1:27:20] cannot produce anything less
[1:27:24] than God In the Flesh today
[1:27:28] not one thing less can it
[1:27:30] it has to produce that the word cannot
[1:27:35] return void
[1:27:37] now if we have a doubt that the word can
[1:27:39] return void then all of the word will
[1:27:42] return void because you nullified it
[1:27:44] with your doubts
[1:27:46] but if you can stand there in faith
[1:27:49] and believe that this word called you
[1:27:51] that you are Son of God your daughter of
[1:27:54] God and the word has called you to this
[1:27:57] position then you can stand in complete
[1:28:00] confidence
[1:28:01] now we talk about that you know uh some
[1:28:05] people think that
[1:28:07] Fox's book
[1:28:08] of Martyrs
[1:28:11] sister Jerry's over there yes yes
[1:28:13] because I half the time mispronounce
[1:28:15] that
[1:28:16] mortars you know yeah
[1:28:20] well I don't know due to miss Dynamite
[1:28:23] maybe it is mortars
[1:28:26] but you read that my brother and sister
[1:28:29] and when you have Believers in the Dark
[1:28:32] Ages
[1:28:34] willingly walk
[1:28:37] to the Post
[1:28:40] they're not dragging them kicking and
[1:28:43] screaming
[1:28:45] and they put them in pile the wood
[1:28:47] around them
[1:28:49] and light it on fire
[1:28:52] and then they sing songs
[1:28:55] glorifying God as they burn to death
[1:29:01] doubt
[1:29:02] will not allow you to do that
[1:29:07] you must have Rock Solid Faith
[1:29:13] this is who I am
[1:29:17] and if this is what God called me to
[1:29:21] then here am I Lord amen
[1:29:24] amen you see we're here my brother and
[1:29:26] sister to do great things but sometimes
[1:29:29] we have to take care of the simple
[1:29:30] things first
[1:29:35] I was just reading a little little
[1:29:37] webinar type thing the other day and
[1:29:39] somebody wrote into this minister
[1:29:41] do we really have to repent
[1:29:49] if you believe your Bible you do
[1:29:53] otherwise if you don't give your Bible
[1:29:55] you'd
[1:29:56] read the repent
[1:29:59] but when
[1:30:01] nothing happens
[1:30:05] another man also
[1:30:07] says
[1:30:10] I tried that religion thing
[1:30:13] and I prayed and I prayed but God never
[1:30:16] answered
[1:30:18] so I left
[1:30:29] who was that buddy uh
[1:30:32] buddy Robinson
[1:30:34] Lord if you don't come you don't change
[1:30:36] me
[1:30:37] you're going to find my bones
[1:30:39] laying here in this field
[1:30:45] what a difference yeah I knocked God
[1:30:48] never answered I left
[1:30:51] Lord if you don't come you're just going
[1:30:53] to find my bones here what a light years
[1:30:56] apart one of faith one of doubt
[1:31:01] they doubted God would answer from the
[1:31:03] very beginning and they got exactly what
[1:31:06] they expected
[1:31:12] having said that sometimes we have
[1:31:14] doubts can we be honest enough yeah
[1:31:17] amen
[1:31:18] we read the promises then we struggle a
[1:31:21] little to see that promise fulfilled and
[1:31:24] have you ever been hesitant now take
[1:31:27] this in the natural take it in the
[1:31:28] spiritual have you ever been hesitant to
[1:31:31] apply something because there was just
[1:31:33] something nagging at you that it it
[1:31:35] wouldn't work
[1:31:38] you know I mean I I had a friend use
[1:31:40] some kind of JB Weld water patch
[1:31:44] and he's like that's been on there for
[1:31:46] 10 years
[1:31:48] I'm standing in the hardware store
[1:31:51] well they want 25 for this stuff and I
[1:31:54] don't know if it's going to work or not
[1:31:56] it worked for him but it might not work
[1:31:58] for me
[1:31:59] I'm not gonna I'm not gonna waste of 25
[1:32:02] dollars
[1:32:04] so what did I do
[1:32:06] I just drilled a hole through there
[1:32:08] and put a deal on the outside with
[1:32:10] silicone and a bolt and a deal on the
[1:32:12] inside not cranked it down it's ugly
[1:32:15] but it worked
[1:32:17] I have confidence in that thing
[1:32:21] but you see he had confidence
[1:32:24] in JB Weld water patch
[1:32:28] it's what we have confidence in Saints
[1:32:31] we have confidence in the world
[1:32:34] then we we we take the world's opinion
[1:32:37] we have confidence in God we take God
[1:32:40] amen it's that simple
[1:32:42] now no this is not the most exciting
[1:32:44] sermon today but I felt like I needed to
[1:32:46] preach it amen
[1:32:48] Hallelujah maybe we're a hesitant to
[1:32:51] apply it and and um you know that doubt
[1:32:54] look Saint doubt is not God's doubt
[1:32:58] amen so where'd it come from if there's
[1:33:00] only two spirits in the church if
[1:33:02] there's doubt where did the doubt come
[1:33:03] from
[1:33:04] now in Luke 11
[1:33:06] uh it's quite a lengthy scripture here
[1:33:10] uh so we're going to just go through it
[1:33:12] real quickly uh amen we'll go down and
[1:33:15] jump right down to verse 5 there and uh
[1:33:18] I'm I'm not going to read everything
[1:33:19] here we're going to just preach this out
[1:33:21] and man so here's Zacharias Amen in the
[1:33:24] course of time here Zacharias is a very
[1:33:28] righteous man his wife Elizabeth is a
[1:33:31] very righteous sister and they had no
[1:33:34] children and so Elizabeth is barren
[1:33:37] and they're getting up in years and it
[1:33:40] comes to pass that while he's doing his
[1:33:42] duty regardless of everything else in
[1:33:45] his life he is doing his duty
[1:33:49] he's performing it well amen and his job
[1:33:53] was to be there at the altar of incense
[1:33:56] and and so it's there that all of a
[1:33:59] sudden is standing there is an angel of
[1:34:01] the Lord standing right there with him
[1:34:03] and I believe you know that it would
[1:34:06] trouble us too it would catch us off
[1:34:08] guard that here is here's an angel
[1:34:11] standing right here and all of a sudden
[1:34:13] he's like okay and and fear fell upon
[1:34:16] him and he was you know wondering what's
[1:34:18] happening and the angel says to him fear
[1:34:20] not Zacharias for thy prayer is heard
[1:34:24] now what prayer is this
[1:34:27] Zacharias no doubt had more prayers than
[1:34:30] Lord bless us with a child
[1:34:33] but that was a prayer that God chose to
[1:34:35] honor
[1:34:37] and you'll find that in that many other
[1:34:39] prayers of Zacharias would have been
[1:34:41] answered also
[1:34:43] and thy wife shall bear thee a son and
[1:34:46] you shall call his name John
[1:34:48] and you'll have joy and gladness and
[1:34:51] many shall rejoice at his birth and I
[1:34:53] Rejoice at John's birth amen for he
[1:34:56] shall be great in the sight of the Lord
[1:34:57] and shall drink neither wine nor strong
[1:35:00] drink and he shall be filled with the
[1:35:01] Holy Ghost even from his mother's womb
[1:35:04] and many of the children of Israel shall
[1:35:06] he turn into the Lord their God and he
[1:35:10] shall go before him in the spirit and
[1:35:12] power of Elias and turn the hearts of
[1:35:14] the fathers to the children and the
[1:35:16] disobedient to the wisdom of the just to
[1:35:19] make ready a people prepared for the
[1:35:21] Lord
[1:35:22] and Zechariah said unto the angel
[1:35:25] now this isn't some great glaring I
[1:35:28] don't believe you
[1:35:31] but he just says
[1:35:32] whereby shall I know this
[1:35:35] for I am an old man and my wife is well
[1:35:37] stricken in years
[1:35:39] you see those simple words were laced
[1:35:44] with doubt
[1:35:51] he's just heard
[1:35:53] an angel of the Lord
[1:35:57] and he's like I don't think this can
[1:35:59] happen
[1:36:02] and the angel answers him
[1:36:05] I can see it now maybe
[1:36:08] very direct
[1:36:10] I am Gabriel
[1:36:15] that stands in the presence of God and
[1:36:17] I'm sent to speak unto thee and to show
[1:36:19] thee he's glad tidings
[1:36:22] and behold
[1:36:23] Thou shalt be dumb and not able to speak
[1:36:26] until the day these things shall be
[1:36:28] performed because thou believest not my
[1:36:32] words
[1:36:34] so he's being rebuked this is a point I
[1:36:37] want you to catch he's being rebuked for
[1:36:40] his unbelief but God's promise still
[1:36:44] stands
[1:36:48] you see the word of God says there will
[1:36:50] be many who don't enter in because of
[1:36:52] their unbelief but here when God is
[1:36:54] dealing with his own he says you know
[1:36:57] what you're going to pay a price for
[1:36:59] your unbelief but this promise still
[1:37:02] stands amen your name was on the Lamb's
[1:37:05] Book of Life before the foundation of
[1:37:07] the world you'll have days that you'll
[1:37:09] have doubt will it cost you yes it will
[1:37:11] cost you but God is not going to take
[1:37:14] the promise away from you
[1:37:16] some people say well you know you sinned
[1:37:19] away your day of Grace if you are the
[1:37:21] Bride of Jesus Christ God will make you
[1:37:25] pay a price for the unbelief but we'll
[1:37:27] never take the promise from you
[1:37:31] amen and he said here it shall be filled
[1:37:34] fulfilled in their season now my brother
[1:37:37] and sister I don't know about you but I
[1:37:39] read that and I get excited amen because
[1:37:42] there's times I just have doubts there's
[1:37:44] times that I'm like I'm not called to do
[1:37:47] this I can't do this if God wanted
[1:37:49] something really good to happen he would
[1:37:51] have got somebody else to do it so I you
[1:37:53] know and by brother and sister when you
[1:37:55] look at that you realize the devil has
[1:37:58] been talking and we have been listening
[1:38:03] now planting the vine and where to plant
[1:38:06] it amen now look at this so you can't
[1:38:09] mix up oil and water and make it work
[1:38:11] right it's got to either be water or oil
[1:38:14] and God is still the same God we got a
[1:38:17] religion that mixes up and says God was
[1:38:19] once did this and doesn't do it today
[1:38:21] then we're trying to put all in water
[1:38:23] together the scripture said he is the
[1:38:26] same yesterday today and forever it just
[1:38:29] won't mix with unbelief Faith won't
[1:38:32] we have faith in God it's Eternal
[1:38:35] unbelief has always been since the
[1:38:38] Garden of Eden God has always wanted his
[1:38:40] people to believe this he wanted them to
[1:38:43] have confidence and to show himself
[1:38:45] among his people God is a spirit amen
[1:38:48] amen if you have confidence in God Amen
[1:38:53] my brother and sister what is it you've
[1:38:55] got to get rid of the unbelief you've
[1:38:58] got to get all of that out of it amen
[1:39:00] and move on let me move on so we can
[1:39:02] finish here in a moment amen I put it
[1:39:05] this way Zacharias did not intentionally
[1:39:09] not believe
[1:39:13] but it was that old man
[1:39:17] it was like
[1:39:19] I don't mean to be Christ
[1:39:21] but we're now old and we've been trying
[1:39:23] to have children
[1:39:24] for many years
[1:39:26] and now you're telling me in our old age
[1:39:30] we're going to have children
[1:39:33] I have no no reference
[1:39:37] Siri
[1:39:40] how many old people have children
[1:39:43] it has been known to happen
[1:39:52] and Gabriel says
[1:39:56] you're not even going to be able to
[1:39:57] speak I'll tell you what to do I'm not
[1:39:59] going to let you go
[1:40:00] this is Paul's take on it okay I hope
[1:40:02] you don't mind but I'm not going to let
[1:40:04] you go out there
[1:40:06] and people say what happened in there
[1:40:08] well I met Gabriel
[1:40:10] everybody be like
[1:40:12] you met Gabriel
[1:40:13] aren't you just
[1:40:15] pouring incense on the Fire
[1:40:20] I met Gabriel
[1:40:22] he said Elizabeth and I were going to
[1:40:23] have a child
[1:40:25] I really don't see how it could happen I
[1:40:27] kind of questioned this you know I mean
[1:40:29] I just don't know what it'd be because
[1:40:31] you guys know you've prayed for us we've
[1:40:32] had prayer requests in the church for
[1:40:34] all these years and we've never had a
[1:40:35] child I just don't see how that could
[1:40:37] really happen no God says you know what
[1:40:39] you got that little seeded out right
[1:40:40] there you haven't conquered yet and so
[1:40:42] I'm just going to make it so you can't
[1:40:44] even speak and that way you cannot
[1:40:47] express what's roaring around in your
[1:40:51] mind
[1:40:54] not what's in his heart
[1:40:56] Zacharias was faithful the scripture
[1:40:58] says him and Elizabeth were righteous
[1:41:00] people if he would have looked at the
[1:41:02] heart his answer would have been
[1:41:04] entirely different but he looked at the
[1:41:07] mind
[1:41:08] and said oh
[1:41:10] how can this happen
[1:41:14] so
[1:41:17] I'll just silence you for a while
[1:41:19] and you know if he wrote on the page I
[1:41:22] met Gabriel
[1:41:23] there's just no way he could put the
[1:41:25] same expression
[1:41:28] come on
[1:41:32] there's a lot of difference
[1:41:36] take a page
[1:41:37] sit down
[1:41:39] and write I am afraid
[1:41:45] it does not have the same impact on you
[1:41:49] is when your own voice
[1:41:52] comes forth
[1:41:53] and says I am afraid
[1:41:58] write on a page
[1:42:00] I doubt
[1:42:03] nothing like the impact it comes when
[1:42:06] your own voice
[1:42:08] says I doubt
[1:42:13] I believe
[1:42:17] hear your own voice
[1:42:19] I believe
[1:42:23] there's something about opening our
[1:42:25] mouth and speaking
[1:42:27] hallelujah what are we doing we're
[1:42:28] planting the seeds of faith
[1:42:31] we're planting the word when we speak
[1:42:33] that out or Worse plant planting the
[1:42:35] terror
[1:42:36] so it's there amen hey come my brother
[1:42:39] and sister it's not that he he really
[1:42:44] questioned that he didn't intentionally
[1:42:46] not believe but that old man was there
[1:42:49] and so it's there that that was the
[1:42:51] first response and that's what I was
[1:42:52] talking about earlier sometimes our very
[1:42:54] first response
[1:42:57] then we have to go and fight our way
[1:42:59] through that
[1:43:01] this is the word amen but in the back of
[1:43:04] the mind there's something saying it's
[1:43:05] not for you
[1:43:07] it's not for you
[1:43:09] it's not for you
[1:43:11] then you have to go and press through
[1:43:13] that that's right amen now brother
[1:43:15] Brandon and letting off the pressure I'm
[1:43:17] going to skip over some stuff here
[1:43:19] and letting off the pressure brother
[1:43:20] Branham says here
[1:43:23] finally let's talk about an eagle
[1:43:26] amen when he gets weary all of his
[1:43:29] feathers are getting loose so he cannot
[1:43:30] fly very high anymore
[1:43:32] then he goes he goes High into the
[1:43:34] mountains until he finds a certain Rock
[1:43:37] and then he sits at that rock now
[1:43:40] the job is that he's got to beat his
[1:43:42] head against that rock until that crust
[1:43:46] flies off amen and they say he will beat
[1:43:49] and beat and beat until his head will
[1:43:51] bleed he will almost knock himself out
[1:43:54] and he will come back and beat again
[1:43:57] until all the crust is gone and when all
[1:44:00] that cross goes off his head
[1:44:03] though he's bleeding and wounded he's
[1:44:05] got the Assurance he will rise up raise
[1:44:08] up and flop what feather he's got and
[1:44:11] scream out he lets off the pressure why
[1:44:13] he knows as soon as all that crust is
[1:44:16] gone he's going to renew his life again
[1:44:19] he gets renewed again new life is sure
[1:44:23] to come when all the crust is gone
[1:44:27] and let me put this in here as a
[1:44:29] reminder real life true stories not
[1:44:33] religion this is life my brother and
[1:44:35] sister when this Eagle is going through
[1:44:38] this stage of life there's another eagle
[1:44:42] bringing fresh meat
[1:44:46] well I don't know
[1:44:48] where did they all go I guess they're
[1:44:50] just aren't Christians they're not
[1:44:51] believers
[1:44:52] no you know while they were trying to
[1:44:54] beat the scale off of their own head
[1:44:57] right amen greatest battle ever fought
[1:44:59] that's right sometimes we've got to find
[1:45:01] a rock and we got a beat until that
[1:45:04] scale falls off
[1:45:06] right do we let him starve to death we
[1:45:08] shouldn't
[1:45:09] we shouldn't
[1:45:11] if nothing
[1:45:13] the least we should be is just praying
[1:45:15] our hearts out
[1:45:20] and when I think how great a God is to
[1:45:23] be mindful of his ego to give that eagle
[1:45:25] a way to renew his life when he's old
[1:45:27] the only thing he has to do is beat the
[1:45:30] crust off
[1:45:31] and that's a great thing oh I know
[1:45:33] another rock that a man can beat the
[1:45:36] crust of the world off there until un
[1:45:39] every unbelief has dropped in every
[1:45:42] shadow and every Fetter has dropped
[1:45:44] until he's got the world beat out of him
[1:45:47] all the unbelief beat out of him all the
[1:45:50] pride beat out of him all the starch
[1:45:52] beat out of him then new life is sure to
[1:45:55] come then you can let off the Steam and
[1:45:58] just start rejoicing because new life is
[1:46:01] sure to come as long as you can beat
[1:46:05] the unbelief out of you
[1:46:08] not the preacher beating it out
[1:46:11] see there's such an emphasis my brother
[1:46:13] and sister that people think somebody's
[1:46:15] going to do this for me but here is in
[1:46:17] these simple words of the Prophet taking
[1:46:19] it and putting it into place I to each
[1:46:21] one of us here including myself today
[1:46:23] we've got to find that rock
[1:46:26] somebody can't find the rock for us and
[1:46:29] somebody can go beat on that rock and it
[1:46:31] won't do you a bit of good but you've
[1:46:33] got to be willing to let yourself beat
[1:46:36] yourself on the Rock Amen
[1:46:41] Hallelujah there's recorded there's an
[1:46:43] area in New York where the Eagles gather
[1:46:46] and they've set up cameras there to film
[1:46:49] all of this and my brother and sister
[1:46:51] there are eagles now if this isn't life
[1:46:53] I don't know what is I'm closing there's
[1:46:55] Eagles that fly there it's a great
[1:46:57] congregation area of eagles and there
[1:47:00] literally will be Eagles that fly there
[1:47:02] and they flew there but they never fly
[1:47:06] again
[1:47:08] and they stand over there
[1:47:10] and other eagles can fly right up and
[1:47:13] drop a nice big chunk of meat right in
[1:47:16] front of them
[1:47:19] and they won't touch it
[1:47:23] and other eagles around them
[1:47:26] are over there beating their beak
[1:47:29] and all of that growth that comes up and
[1:47:32] starts to cover they're over there
[1:47:33] within steps
[1:47:36] beating their head on the rock
[1:47:39] and this eagle
[1:47:42] does nothing
[1:47:46] and I'm going to just kind of put it
[1:47:47] this way
[1:47:49] day by day
[1:47:51] week by week
[1:47:53] year by year
[1:47:55] this eagle
[1:47:57] gets weaker
[1:47:59] until one day
[1:48:01] it dies
[1:48:05] and people say what happened
[1:48:09] what happened
[1:48:13] we could go for another couple hours on
[1:48:15] that
[1:48:17] but I tell you that an eagle that's
[1:48:19] anointed you know they've got some of
[1:48:20] those Eagles that they they have mapped
[1:48:23] out their ages I don't know how they do
[1:48:24] all that stuff but they're very old at
[1:48:28] one point in time there was an eagle
[1:48:30] that they had kept records on that they
[1:48:33] believed had been around when George
[1:48:34] Washington
[1:48:36] tomorrow
[1:48:37] it's pretty old eagle
[1:48:40] it's been back a few years you know
[1:48:42] maybe in my childhood
[1:48:47] but look at this my brother and sister
[1:48:49] what happened the eagle that was willing
[1:48:51] to go beat his head on the rock
[1:48:54] see brother Branham didn't just make
[1:48:56] this story up this is real that's right
[1:48:58] this is real the eagle that's willing to
[1:49:01] beat his head on the Rock and beat all
[1:49:04] the unbelief out of himself and all the
[1:49:06] doubts and all the fears
[1:49:08] is going to renew his strength and go on
[1:49:10] and live
[1:49:12] but if they won't that growth of the
[1:49:15] beak
[1:49:17] do you know part of the issue of why
[1:49:19] they don't go ahead and eat you say well
[1:49:20] the beak has screwed up but what happens
[1:49:22] is is that young Tinder those of you
[1:49:25] ever
[1:49:27] nailed your thumb to the wall
[1:49:30] you know
[1:49:31] believe it or not hiding down there's
[1:49:33] another thumbnail
[1:49:38] and underneath that beak is another beak
[1:49:41] Desiring to be free and they start to
[1:49:45] separate
[1:49:46] an eagle can't actually write because
[1:49:48] they're called rippers of Flesh
[1:49:52] and he can't rip flesh because now he's
[1:49:54] he's got this separation in there
[1:49:57] and he can't really rip the flesh
[1:50:01] and then he can't eat
[1:50:06] let's see
[1:50:08] cares of life
[1:50:11] the world
[1:50:14] all the things of the world
[1:50:17] why it's got to be
[1:50:19] broke
[1:50:21] it's got to be separated from us
[1:50:24] we're not going to devise a you know a a
[1:50:27] way to feed the eagle so he can just go
[1:50:29] on in his present condition
[1:50:32] no God provided the rock that's right
[1:50:34] and the Instinct in the eagle
[1:50:38] to go to that rock
[1:50:41] and I think it's such a beautiful type
[1:50:42] because it's not just any Rock they
[1:50:44] gather they gather together and there's
[1:50:48] something about that place
[1:50:50] can you imagine an eagle conversation
[1:50:52] Sister Sarah will you come you imagine
[1:50:55] the eagle conversation
[1:50:57] this is The Rock
[1:50:59] my grandpa
[1:51:01] beat his head on
[1:51:04] and grandpa said great grandpa and great
[1:51:08] great grandpa beat their head on this
[1:51:10] rock
[1:51:11] now look how it is for us as Sons and
[1:51:13] Daughters of God
[1:51:16] help us that our children
[1:51:19] and our children's children
[1:51:21] would be able to say
[1:51:24] my grandpa my great grandpa
[1:51:28] beat his head
[1:51:30] on this rock amen amen
[1:51:33] and that's
[1:51:35] why our family is what our family is
[1:51:39] because the rock breaks away everything
[1:51:44] you know as we look at this and realize
[1:51:46] Zacharias
[1:51:47] all that had happened
[1:51:50] amen
[1:51:52] God give them one child
[1:51:55] give them late in life
[1:51:57] gave him a child that was considered at
[1:52:00] the time a wild man
[1:52:02] [Music]
[1:52:06] I probably think that sometimes
[1:52:09] Elizabeth
[1:52:10] probably went Lord
[1:52:13] would you bless me with
[1:52:17] you know I'm trying to fix these good
[1:52:19] meals for my son and he's out here
[1:52:20] eating Locust
[1:52:22] he's getting stung while he's digging
[1:52:25] the honey out of the Rock
[1:52:26] what kind of wild man he disappears for
[1:52:29] days on end out in the woods my brother
[1:52:32] and sister he wasn't wearing a
[1:52:33] three-piece suit and one day just went
[1:52:35] on a skin and went out in the wilderness
[1:52:37] that was his nature amen Elizabeth God
[1:52:42] tempered her
[1:52:43] because he knew what he was giving her
[1:52:47] and knew what the job was it wasn't
[1:52:50] about Elizabeth
[1:52:52] it was about the calling placed on
[1:52:54] John's life I'm thankful for John's
[1:52:57] calling amen he was one of a man of
[1:53:00] Courage amen now look at this you go a
[1:53:03] little farther in Luke
[1:53:05] right there same chapter
[1:53:08] and here's Mary
[1:53:10] we didn't get there today
[1:53:12] here's Mary
[1:53:14] almost the same words
[1:53:18] [Music]
[1:53:20] but look at the after
[1:53:23] response she's like
[1:53:26] how is this going to happen to me it
[1:53:28] seems how I've never known a man
[1:53:33] [Music]
[1:53:37] and the response is be it unto me
[1:53:42] [Music]
[1:53:44] understand this be it unto me though let
[1:53:48] the word come to pass in me
[1:53:51] be it unto me
[1:53:54] amen I'll stop at that right there
[1:53:56] because we could just go on
[1:53:58] hallelujah amen
[1:54:01] just amazing to me how the response is
[1:54:04] not that far removed from each other
[1:54:07] God doesn't take a promise away from
[1:54:09] Zacharias but he silences him
[1:54:14] and what does he do gives voice
[1:54:17] to Mary and the courage
[1:54:20] that while the whole world sorry I hope
[1:54:22] this is not too straightforward while
[1:54:25] the whole world fought
[1:54:27] that she had been
[1:54:29] a promiscuous young woman
[1:54:33] that she had something to hide something
[1:54:35] to do
[1:54:36] and Mary wasn't silent
[1:54:39] you see Mary lived right in her
[1:54:40] community after the Holy Ghost come to
[1:54:43] her
[1:54:44] amen and it started to produce Jesus
[1:54:47] Christ now God help us not to be silent
[1:54:49] in our neighborhood not to have to move
[1:54:52] out or whatever but let it be according
[1:54:55] to your word Lord if this is you Lord
[1:54:58] then it will be and no one you know the
[1:55:01] song says you know I ought to know I was
[1:55:03] there when it happened I had to know
[1:55:04] amen they might have looked at Mary like
[1:55:07] they did but she was the one that was
[1:55:10] reminded by her own words when she said
[1:55:12] be it unto me she said I'm willing to
[1:55:15] Bear the reproach I'm willing to be this
[1:55:19] oh Hallelujah
[1:55:21] be it unto me let's just stand and sing
[1:55:24] that song Amen Hallelujah
[1:55:30] 7 12 brother brother brother Gideon I
[1:55:33] actually just as I finished up there in
[1:55:35] the office

[1:57:29] I just had to share that from my heart
[1:57:32] you know sometimes I just wished I could
[1:57:34] preach as good as I do in the tractor
[1:57:39] you know it always seems to be so
[1:57:41] inspired there it comes just flows
[1:57:45] but still it's the same word it's the
[1:57:48] same God that wrote it amen same God
[1:57:51] that's bringing it to pass
[1:57:53] so whether I can do it perfectly or not
[1:57:55] shouldn't be whether it's good for us or
[1:57:57] not amen hallelujah
