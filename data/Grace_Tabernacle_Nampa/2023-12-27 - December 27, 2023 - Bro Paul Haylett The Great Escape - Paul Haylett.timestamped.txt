[25:23] privilege my brothers and sisters to

[25:29] have
[25:30] interaction with others around us in the
[25:32] world to just really recognize truly how
[25:35] blessed we are it uh we we sometimes I
[25:38] think as humans we we tend to adapt we
[25:41] get used to a certain thing and uh we
[25:44] kind of forget really where we're at and
[25:48] uh how easy it is uh to to just come
[25:55] to uh without the proper approach
[25:57] appreciation come to just expect and in
[26:01] the right context that is good and um
[26:04] out of context we just don't appreciate
[26:08] what God's doing for us anyway we just
[26:11] want to say thank you for God's grace
[26:13] and mercy each one of you tonight and um
[26:17] we want to
[26:18] remember um our young people in the
[26:21] church those right here in the body we
[26:23] have such a lovely group of young people
[26:25] and we want to remember those that are
[26:27] out side of the body amen that we know
[26:29] God has has done things in their life we
[26:32] know God has spoke to them uh but Satan
[26:34] has painted such a picture that they uh
[26:38] have different different things that
[26:40] hinder them and hold them back and we
[26:42] want to keep them in prayer just once
[26:45] again a reminder uh that um next Sunday
[26:48] evening uh we put 6: PM as the official
[26:51] time but you can come before and uh
[26:55] we're definitely looking forward to um
[26:57] uh you know songs and worship and um
[27:01] special songs that would be there and
[27:03] seem how there's not a lot of us some of
[27:05] you ought to just prepare for a couple
[27:08] songs amen I know Brother David throw
[27:11] you under the bus here you mentioned a
[27:13] all back about something stirring your
[27:15] heart about singing so I I just wonder
[27:19] uh if you can be here well we'll pray
[27:21] you can be here and we'll pray that God
[27:23] anoints you with a song Amen so let's
[27:26] just turn
[27:28] uh in our Bibles this evening God bless
[27:30] you our musicians uh and uh everyone and
[27:34] uh I want to speak to you tonight on The
[27:37] Great Escape and uh you know there has
[27:41] been a lot of worldly versions of the
[27:43] Great Escape but the
[27:45] bride amen God has made a way for her
[27:48] she is going to make her Great Escape
[27:52] and I I look forward to that my heart
[27:54] longs for the day that we just you might
[27:57] say make the Great Escape but we have to
[27:59] put that in the right context because in
[28:02] essence we're not just trying to escape
[28:04] this world but uh we'll just take it
[28:07] back to our scripture Hebrews the 2
[28:09] chapter verses 1-4 today
[28:12] amen therefore we ought to give the more
[28:14] en Earnest heed to the things which we
[28:17] have heard lest at any time we should
[28:20] let them slip for if the word spoken by
[28:23] Angels was steadfast in every
[28:25] transgression and disobedience received
[28:27] a just recompense of reward how shall we
[28:31] escape if we neglect so great salvation
[28:35] which at first began to be spoken by the
[28:37] Lord and was confirmed unto us by them
[28:41] that heard him now we need to stop and
[28:44] just Analyze That for just a
[28:47] moment these things that God spoke was
[28:50] confirmed unto us so there was a I'm
[28:54] going to use the word
[28:55] intermediary someone in the
[28:58] middle God spoke it someone heard it and
[29:03] they confirmed it unto
[29:05] us amen amen aren't you glad amen we're
[29:09] not sitting here with just a random idea
[29:11] of God sent a prophet amen but it was
[29:14] confirmed unto us that we would know
[29:18] this is what God has spoken God also
[29:20] bearing them witness both with signs and
[29:22] wonders and with diverse Miracles and
[29:24] Gifts of the Holy Ghost according to his
[29:27] own will Heavenly Father we just ask you
[29:30] lord to bless the service tonight speak
[29:32] to our hearts father it's touched me
[29:34] already Lord just to know your presence
[29:37] Lord Lord sometimes father we we just
[29:41] get so caught up in the things of life
[29:43] that we miss the very Simplicity of
[29:46] which you come to us and speak to us and
[29:48] lift us up we ask you father to help us
[29:51] Lord not to miss that Simplicity but to
[29:54] recognize you in all things in our Our
[29:57] Lives bless this body of Believers bless
[30:00] the prayer requests and the needs Lord
[30:02] we ask in your precious name amen
[30:05] hallelujah you may be
[30:11] seated Amen to each one I know that
[30:14] would desire to be here tonight but we
[30:17] don't see just pray God comes and Deals
[30:20] kindly with each and every one of us now
[30:23] as we look at this I want to focus on
[30:26] the third verse how shall we escape if
[30:29] we neglect so great a Salvation And I
[30:32] think it's very clear saints that uh
[30:34] this uh not escaping in other words not
[30:36] getting out of here and neglecting our
[30:39] Salvation directly connected together so
[30:42] some will have amen a word from the Lord
[30:45] some will have an unction to act upon
[30:48] the word but they will be things that
[30:50] hinder them from taking the steps that
[30:52] are NE necessary and we know that if
[30:55] anything is neglected it will will
[30:57] deteriorate and uh you know I just
[31:00] remember kind of telling myself that
[31:02] many years ago um I wasn't really
[31:04] serving the Lord with all my heart I was
[31:06] very much focused on on be business and
[31:10] and farming and Etc and you know you
[31:13] would find that there would be things
[31:15] that you would do and I'm going to use a
[31:17] very simple analogy you would lean a
[31:20] shovel against a post or somewhere uh
[31:23] and in your busyness forgot that you had
[31:26] put that sh there and by the time you
[31:29] ReDiscover the the shovel all the
[31:31] varnish has weathered from the handle
[31:34] and it's all checked and roughed and the
[31:36] weakness uh the strength of the handle
[31:38] has faded from it and you're afraid then
[31:41] to use the shovel to its F full
[31:43] potential because it's no longer has the
[31:45] Integrity it did and and it's all
[31:48] because it wasn't the shovels fault it
[31:50] was all because we neglected it and did
[31:52] not take care of what was there I think
[31:55] that simple analogy would register with
[31:57] us amen that uh stewardship would be
[32:00] another way to look at that so if we uh
[32:03] would uh neglect this great salvation
[32:06] amen then it's telling us you'll be able
[32:09] to look and see why that uh we did not
[32:12] escape and I don't know about you but I
[32:14] was not called to sit here and stay in
[32:17] this world Amen not called to face a
[32:19] judgment that come when God said just
[32:21] judge yourself and come and bring your
[32:24] heart and soul before me and I will be
[32:26] judged to forgive you amen how simple is
[32:30] that that he would be just to forgive us
[32:33] if we just bring those things and so I
[32:35] say just in a simple context tonight
[32:38] let's just stop and look in our life and
[32:41] if there's things that are there let's
[32:42] just make sure that we're taking care
[32:44] and not neglecting uh and bringing these
[32:47] things together amen as we'll look at
[32:49] this we'll see that it is uh God's Army
[32:53] uh is in a preparation time aren't you
[32:56] glad there's a prep preparation amen
[32:58] there's a preparation time and she will
[33:01] not and now hear me through this because
[33:04] it is kind of a a connective thought
[33:07] here she will not neglect that's right
[33:11] we can go as far as to say she cannot
[33:15] neglect now it seems sometimes that we
[33:18] would have things that we have neglected
[33:20] but my brother and sister we can be
[33:22] buffeted by uh and I don't even know if
[33:25] this is a real word it didn't correct it
[33:27] so I'm assuming it actually is a word
[33:29] but we can be neglectful and we can fall
[33:32] under a neglectful spirit that we would
[33:35] stop one day and realize you know
[33:37] there's certain things in my life that I
[33:39] I used to do or I know I should do kind
[33:41] of iniquity and that we would be and God
[33:45] is so loving he's so kind to us that he
[33:48] doesn't then judge us for that my
[33:50] brother and sister he draws our
[33:52] attention to it he he reminds us in this
[33:55] Midnight Hour through the preaching of
[33:57] the word listening to the prophet uh
[34:00] through music he reminds us that there
[34:02] are things in our life that we are
[34:04] neglecting at the moment and so it's
[34:06] there that I would say in in a
[34:08] confidence today that in this
[34:10] preparation time we would look and be
[34:13] able to say I have neglected some of
[34:15] these duties of the Lord but God is
[34:17] mindful to come because he knows that
[34:21] you cannot be neglectful and take a full
[34:24] salvation into Redemption
[34:27] that Mak sense to
[34:28] you amen ever been buffeted by a
[34:32] neglectful Spirit oh I I think every one
[34:35] of us would have to be honest and say
[34:36] that but look my brother and sister what
[34:38] God does is he by the spirit moves and
[34:43] stirs up our minds into remembrance this
[34:47] is what the preaching of the word does
[34:48] sometimes people get a little bit like
[34:50] well it seems like the preacher tonight
[34:53] is preaching towards me my brother and
[34:55] sister that's God just reach ing down by
[34:57] his grace and mercy down from glory and
[35:00] stirring up your pure mind and Satan
[35:02] doesn't like that he's trying to push
[35:05] back don't that he's preaching at you
[35:07] yes he is because it's God saying you've
[35:10] been neglectful and I don't want you to
[35:12] be neglectful because you cannot forsake
[35:15] such a great salvation that God has
[35:17] given us amen and so while we're
[35:20] buffeted by this neglectful Spirit the
[35:23] spirit of God the holy spirit is coming
[35:25] down taking the word and stirring us
[35:28] into remembrance now my brother and
[35:31] sister the word cannot fall on infertile
[35:33] ground and you you know we might say
[35:35] well well that's not scriptural but my
[35:37] brother and sister we're not talking to
[35:39] the unbeliever the makeb believer the
[35:41] Heathen we're talking to the bride of
[35:42] Christ and the word cannot fall on
[35:45] unfertile ground in your life every seed
[35:48] that God deposits in your life God knew
[35:51] it would bring forth amen and so we have
[35:54] to then sometimes it's hard
[35:57] you know I find Farm some ground that
[35:59] when I'm farming out there on that
[36:01] ground I plant in the spring I slow
[36:04] weigh down with the planter because
[36:06] there's so many rocks not defying The
[36:09] Parables of scripture but I'm telling
[36:12] you even in a rocky situations of your
[36:14] life and God will slow down if you'll
[36:17] just follow me in this thought God will
[36:19] slow down because he knows that seed was
[36:21] intended for you and that planter will
[36:24] then do its job even when it's bouncing
[36:27] and skitting and screeching through the
[36:29] rocks and the stand of corn or beans or
[36:33] wheat will be just as good in that Rocky
[36:35] ground because the effort was taken to
[36:38] get the seed in the ground Amen in our
[36:42] hard Stony heart sometimes we would just
[36:46] be at a stage of our life and we might
[36:48] even acknowledge to ourselves I don't
[36:50] know that this service tonight is really
[36:52] going to do me any good it seems like
[36:54] the brothers preaching too straight too
[36:56] too hard and I don't know if I can
[36:58] receive it but the holy spirit will just
[37:00] bring everything
[37:02] down and let that seed make it down into
[37:05] the fertile soul of a son or daughter of
[37:08] God and it will bring forth fruit God
[37:12] knew what he was doing that's why we
[37:15] should never be in a
[37:17] hurry let me put it this way I'm not I'm
[37:20] not uh this is going to be blunt but
[37:21] it's not about how long we preach
[37:23] sometimes but sometimes in the blowing
[37:28] down it takes
[37:32] time we can't just rush through
[37:34] church sometimes God's got to get the
[37:36] seed down in the fertile
[37:39] soil we become so conscious of
[37:42] time like I said I'm not justifying a
[37:45] long- winded preacher like myself but
[37:48] sometimes we get so caught up in time we
[37:50] need to hurry through
[37:53] this and then it only brings forth
[37:55] 40-fold
[37:57] and we wonder
[37:59] why well I figured that out not trying
[38:02] to go into a gromy lesson here tonight
[38:04] but I figure that out every moment even
[38:08] in the Rocky
[38:09] times are you with
[38:11] me in the Rocky times every moment of my
[38:15] busy life that I give up to let the seed
[38:17] settle
[38:18] down I had ground I used to say you know
[38:21] this ground's just never going to
[38:22] produce a crop but did you know that
[38:24] once I slowed down and made sure the
[38:25] seed actually made it in the
[38:28] ground that ground
[38:30] produces and sometimes our old hard
[38:33] Rocky Hearts we just need to let God
[38:36] have time that's right that something
[38:39] would come
[38:40] forth amen so the spirit is stirring up
[38:44] pure Minds my brother and sister
[38:45] different people different results you
[38:48] know we can look in the world we live in
[38:50] today and and uh you know you can look
[38:52] and say well I see something happening
[38:54] over here I see something happening over
[38:56] there and it seems like this has got a
[38:58] little revival going on it seems like
[39:00] they're doing a little Revival but if
[39:02] we'll take the time to stop and see the
[39:04] seed that God has planted in us we would
[39:06] recognize Revival is right here in our
[39:09] midst because we have to come down to
[39:11] the definition of Revival that is God's
[39:13] definition not the world's definition
[39:16] the world's definition needs that people
[39:18] need to Shout Scream run jump hard do
[39:21] whatever God's Revival my brother and
[39:24] sister is the holy spirit moving down in
[39:26] us and stirring our Pure minds and
[39:29] bringing to to us a cognizant awareness
[39:33] of a living God in us and then we can
[39:36] recognize God's Reviving me again and
[39:38] that means you can have a one person
[39:40] Revival yes sir you don't have to have a
[39:43] whole church it doesn't have to be a
[39:45] multitude of reaction it can be God
[39:47] stirring one heart one soul to react to
[39:51] the word of God and that is a Revival
[39:54] you notice when brother brandom preaches
[39:57] about the Welsh Revival that man that
[40:00] policeman with the billy
[40:02] club he doesn't give them any directions
[40:05] to a building to a movement to a place
[40:10] that man had Revelation I am the revival
[40:14] can we say that tonight I am the Revival
[40:17] amen it doesn't have to be a great
[40:19] movement over here it doesn't need to
[40:21] make it to social media doesn't need to
[40:23] make it to a billboard the Revival is in
[40:26] you and I and God is coming and putting
[40:28] a Revival in our midst amen Les we
[40:32] become distracted to the things of this
[40:36] world you know I want to say thank you
[40:39] Lord for stirring the bride
[40:42] amen you know sometimes you'll see
[40:44] something and somebody will ask you
[40:49] know what is the bride's
[40:52] Revival recently saw a little a little
[40:55] deal somebody was like is there going to
[40:58] be a bride's
[41:00] Revival now I believe they were asking
[41:02] that in more of a rhetorical kind of
[41:04] question but I'm here to tell you
[41:06] tonight the bride is in Revival
[41:08] absolutely amen she's being stirred by
[41:10] the Holy Spirit each and every day her
[41:13] life is being brought into line with the
[41:16] presence of almighty God with a life
[41:18] that is poured out of the word she's
[41:20] having a Revival my brother and sister
[41:22] and we don't have to advertise it we
[41:25] don't have to run up and down down the
[41:26] streets the prophet of God in fact said
[41:28] it won't be a public show amen that's
[41:31] getting pretty close to home if you can
[41:33] have a Revival and people won't
[41:35] necessarily around you even know you're
[41:37] having a revival can you bring a thought
[41:40] in your mind looking back and say I've
[41:42] experienced that God has spoke to me God
[41:44] has dealt with me God has turned my
[41:47] heart and brought these things out to me
[41:49] and we don't have to then write a
[41:50] journal and publish
[41:52] it it was meant for the bride amen
[41:57] amen collectively when we come together
[41:58] as the bride of Christ there will be
[42:00] energy in that but my brother and sister
[42:03] what God's doing is selecting his own
[42:06] bride he's not selecting the church he's
[42:08] not selecting the movement not selecting
[42:11] the country he's selecting the
[42:13] individual and the individual can be in
[42:15] a full-blown Revival and the world
[42:18] doesn't even recognize it right and it's
[42:21] there that the word has come because
[42:23] it's not an outward stirring
[42:26] of a church as in Revival but a stirring
[42:29] of the innermost part of our soul that
[42:32] God is bringing us to that place I say
[42:34] this is what the bride's Revival is this
[42:36] is when the bride who maybe gets a
[42:38] little too busy and God then stirs her
[42:41] pure mind and she realizes you know the
[42:44] devil is distracting me and she comes
[42:46] right back maybe a little something
[42:48] creeps into our life and we don't even
[42:50] realize it till the word comes and
[42:53] reveals it to us and we are stirred by
[42:55] that and come back in line with the word
[42:58] we want to please God my brother and
[43:00] sister there is not some magic formula
[43:03] for pleasing God we arranged the
[43:05] furniture just studying this week
[43:07] brother bradam says it's not how you set
[43:09] up the church it's not the flowers on
[43:11] the pulpit took it back to Cain and Abel
[43:13] it's not those things that's not what
[43:15] pleases God it's Sons and Daughters of
[43:18] God who desire to be aligned with the
[43:21] word of God that's what pleases God I
[43:24] say tonight I want to please gone I want
[43:27] my life to be in line with him because
[43:30] when my life is in line with him he then
[43:33] keeps me in
[43:39] line I just ask you what will the
[43:41] bride's Revival look
[43:44] like do we have a pattern we must put
[43:47] over
[43:47] it to say this is the bride's Revival
[43:51] what you're doing here is not that's not
[43:53] that's not this
[43:55] is no my brother and sister you realize
[43:57] a bride revival can actually be
[43:59] different for you than it is for
[44:04] me oh no we're not talking about
[44:06] changing the
[44:07] word talking about
[44:11] expression we sang it
[44:14] tonight sometimes
[44:18] hallelu sometimes praise the
[44:24] Lord everybody's got to a different
[44:27] expression I pray tonight we're all in a
[44:30] Revival I pray tonight that we're not
[44:32] sitting here saying I'm hoping for a
[44:33] Revival but we can say I'm in a Revival
[44:36] God restoring strength back to me wisdom
[44:39] back to me the word back to me amen
[44:41] cleansing my life washing me the water
[44:43] of the word each and every day and I'm
[44:45] telling you there's Sons and Daughters
[44:47] of God that are the less
[44:49] vocal they're just as much in Revival as
[44:52] those that are extreme
[44:54] vocal because the vocal does not
[44:58] determine the Revival that's right how
[45:02] loud we speak does not determine Revival
[45:06] that's right
[45:07] amen I know a lot of grandmothers in
[45:10] this
[45:10] message hardly would hear them say Amen
[45:15] but their life is evidence there's a
[45:18] Revival in the land their life is
[45:22] evidenced that God's word is manifesting
[45:25] to a world
[45:26] today amen quietly just
[45:30] living the
[45:32] word there's Revival
[45:35] amen you see there's a deep stirring
[45:38] taking place in this Bride Can Can you
[45:41] agree with me tonight a deep stirring
[45:43] God just dealing with us on an
[45:45] individual level sitting reading our
[45:47] Bible studying the message on our own
[45:49] level maybe not even a public uh thing
[45:51] not not a church element not even Bible
[45:54] studies or prayer meetings or whatever
[45:56] but God stirring the hearts of Sons and
[45:58] Daughters of God because in the stirring
[46:01] of the word it is like the spring that
[46:04] is washing all the Twigs all of the
[46:06] little leaves all of the little things
[46:08] the little grasshopper the little
[46:09] whatever is all being washed out you
[46:11] notice that running water never produces
[46:14] a mosquito
[46:16] right amen living water doesn't produce
[46:20] blood suckers
[46:23] no living water my brother and sister
[46:26] cleanses
[46:27] itself in the
[46:29] Stream doesn't need man to cleanse it it
[46:32] cleanses
[46:33] itself and as we're washed in the water
[46:36] of the word we are actually my brother
[46:38] and sister having Revival as we're
[46:40] Washed by the Water of the word that
[46:42] doesn't mean we jump up and Shout Scream
[46:44] and holler but we're being Washed by the
[46:46] Water of the word and in evidence of
[46:48] that the prophet of God said of those
[46:51] six evidences that he speaks readily
[46:52] about having the Holy Ghost is one of
[46:55] those is is hearing believing and acting
[46:58] on the word we often get times and I'm
[47:01] not criticizing I'm not don't
[47:03] misunderstand me but we were looking for
[47:05] all these actions to have evidence of
[47:07] the Holy Ghost and the prophet of God
[47:09] said believing acting on it amen is a
[47:13] sign of having the holy
[47:15] ghost that means we don't have to jump
[47:17] run Shout Scream holler we don't have to
[47:20] do Extreme as it is but we can just be
[47:23] that quiet Revival taking place
[47:26] in our church in our neighborhood in our
[47:28] family amen amen there's a deep stirring
[47:32] though I believe I see it taking place
[47:34] in this brine the world may not see
[47:39] anything what they see
[47:41] is a woman a lady long hair dressed
[47:47] appropriate
[47:49] modest and they tend to kind of look at
[47:51] you like where did you come from where
[47:53] what what rock did you climb out from
[47:55] underneath that's what the world sees
[47:58] but what God sees and the rest of the
[48:01] bride of Christ sees is a very evidence
[48:03] of someone believing the word and I'm
[48:06] not talking about a leg legalistic form
[48:08] of this I'm talking about something
[48:10] coming from a sister's heart this is who
[48:12] I am this is what I believe and this is
[48:15] what I will manifest or live and you see
[48:17] then the evidence of the Holy Ghost
[48:19] coming forward bringing forth fruit and
[48:23] then the world don't even really know
[48:25] what they're looking
[48:28] at they
[48:30] see a woman they see young ladies they
[48:34] see all of this they don't understand
[48:37] it but they see
[48:39] it now one of the things that the
[48:41] prophet of God showed us my brother and
[48:43] sister he said we are not required to
[48:45] explain it that's right we're required
[48:48] to live it that's right so as we just
[48:51] live it we're having a
[48:54] Revival we literally are having a
[48:56] Revival as we live it oh you know the
[48:59] devil come along and say well you make
[49:01] mistakes yes of course it
[49:03] does it happens it's there it's present
[49:07] with us but you got to remember my
[49:09] brother and sister what God Said was
[49:12] perfect is
[49:14] perfect amen some people might look and
[49:17] say that house is
[49:21] unfinished God looks it as a finished
[49:24] work amen it doesn't matter what they
[49:26] think the Revival the finishing the
[49:29] stirring the completion the finality is
[49:33] that where God put it not what the devil
[49:35] put amen and the devil tries to make us
[49:37] align to his
[49:41] definitions Amen brother Brown talks
[49:43] about us having uh you know speaking
[49:45] negatively that we're speaking the
[49:47] devil's language so we understand the
[49:48] devil's got his own language and we got
[49:51] to be careful we're not speaking the
[49:52] devil's language Lord help us to speak
[49:54] your language
[49:56] cuz the devil will tell you you're not
[49:58] you're a failure you're this you're that
[50:00] you're that brother Bram defines that
[50:02] and says that's the devil's
[50:04] language and we're not called to do
[50:07] that amen see the
[50:11] devil he knows he's heard the word he he
[50:13] can quote it better than we
[50:17] can and the
[50:20] world doesn't even know what is
[50:23] stirring in this
[50:26] Pride because you see it's revealed by
[50:29] Revelation and Revelation alone that's
[50:31] right without revelation we wouldn't see
[50:33] the stirring from the simple word but
[50:36] with revelation we see great Mysteries
[50:39] being revealed in the day that we live
[50:41] in the the the naysayers and those that
[50:44] are critics my brother and sister may
[50:46] have things I I just was reading today
[50:48] and and you know it reminded me of a
[50:50] conversation that I'd had and and
[50:52] somebody tried to imply that uh you know
[50:55] know if you don't believe William
[50:57] brandom's message then you're not going
[51:00] to make it but here's the prophet in
[51:03] bold print saying the only thing that
[51:07] matters is the Gospel of Jesus Christ
[51:10] now what voice are we going to listen
[51:13] to what
[51:15] Revival Revival of who we were you know
[51:18] that's what it is we're either going
[51:19] forward or we're going backwards and
[51:21] Satan's trying to come up with his own
[51:24] Revival but his Revival and we'll tie
[51:26] this in in a little bit his own Revival
[51:28] comes with uncertainties and doubts and
[51:30] fears and all of these things and my
[51:33] brother and sister that's that's his
[51:35] gospel now in the greatest battle ever
[51:38] fought brother Brenham says
[51:41] here he says and so an Army
[51:46] first so an Army first in getting ready
[51:51] for a battle first there's got to be a
[51:54] select some soldiers they've got to be
[51:57] dressed for fighting they've got to be
[52:00] trained for fighting and I believe that
[52:03] the greatest battle that was ever fought
[52:06] is now ready to go in action I believe
[52:08] that God has been selecting his soldiers
[52:11] Can someone say thank you Lord amen amen
[52:14] been selecting his soldiers and I
[52:16] believe he's been dressing them training
[52:20] them and the Battlefront is now set
[52:22] getting ready to start this great first
[52:25] battle that was ever fought began in
[52:27] heaven when Michael and his angels
[52:29] fought against Lucifer and his angels it
[52:32] first started the first battle was in
[52:35] heaven so sin did not originate on
[52:41] Earth much more complex than the average
[52:44] person really grasp and then it was
[52:47] thrown down from heaven cast out of
[52:49] Heaven to the Earth and fell on human
[52:52] beings this my brother and sister now
[52:54] pardon me for tying this together but
[52:56] this is a thought that comes to me the
[52:58] prophet of God speaks to us that you
[53:01] don't have to worry about as it is where
[53:03] did a thought come from this fail this
[53:05] this thought come you just don't let the
[53:08] bird build a nest amen and this sin fell
[53:13] out of heaven and it's falling sin is
[53:15] falling right here leoa and Satan is
[53:18] still the debris if you would bear with
[53:21] me the debris is still falling Landing
[53:24] in our thoughts and Landing in our
[53:25] emotions and all of these things the
[53:28] prophet of God talked about and there
[53:29] Comes A Time For Us simply not to let
[53:32] the sin that is still falling to settle
[53:35] and take root on us it don't mean you
[53:38] won't have a thought won't have an
[53:39] emotion won't have an action but you
[53:41] don't have to let it stay there amen
[53:44] there's a merciful thought from the
[53:47] Lord amen cast out of Heaven fell on
[53:51] human beings then the battle from Angels
[53:53] become human battles and Satan come to
[53:56] destroy God's
[53:59] creation what God had created to be for
[54:05] himself was he talking about the pine
[54:12] trees was he talking about flowers
[54:14] destroying the flowers destroying the
[54:16] pine trees destroying
[54:19] that where is the true measure of God's
[54:24] creation
[54:25] we were created to be his bride amen we
[54:29] were created to be his helpmate we were
[54:32] created to fulfill the very thing that
[54:35] God longed for and that was to be
[54:37] worshiped not worshiped by some beetles
[54:40] kind of Christian band my brother and
[54:42] sister not kind of some beatnick kind of
[54:44] approach to God W with the you know
[54:47] flashing lights and all of the robust
[54:50] presentation that's not what it's
[54:52] looking for we the bride of Jesus Christ
[54:55] Christ were created to fulfill that part
[54:58] of Jesus Christ that he longed for and
[55:00] that was a
[55:01] wife and we as in the human element long
[55:05] for someone to be our mate someone that
[55:08] that fits with us someone that is of our
[55:10] nature helps us gives us Comfort gives
[55:13] us peace and God long for you can I say
[55:17] that strong enough God longed for you
[55:20] hard for us sometimes to grasp the idea
[55:22] that God was longing for your fellow
[55:25] Fellowship longing for my fellowship but
[55:27] God longed for you and made you who you
[55:30] are to satisfy a certain portion of who
[55:34] he is that's right otherwise he would
[55:37] have just chose bride literally out of
[55:39] the millions or hundreds of millions or
[55:42] whatever on the Earth today he'd have
[55:43] just selected
[55:45] one but he chose a Min member body that
[55:48] he calls the bride of Christ because
[55:50] there was aspects that was in him there
[55:52] was attributes that were in him and he
[55:55] wanted to satisfy that and he wanted his
[55:58] desire to be expressed not just here in
[56:00] NPA Idaho he wanted to be expressed all
[56:03] over the Earth my brother and sister
[56:05] this bride in the natural she would not
[56:07] be able in the natural to satisfy going
[56:10] each and every place to present amen a
[56:13] living Bride for a living God but my
[56:15] brother and sister he placed a many
[56:17] membered body out there and put in them
[56:19] the same attributes righten that's why
[56:23] you can get off of of plane on another
[56:27] continent you can walk through the doors
[56:29] of a building or the doors of a
[56:32] house in a few minutes you know your
[56:38] home because they have the same exact
[56:41] spirit amen it's not their spirit it's
[56:44] not your spirit it's his spirit and he
[56:48] poured that into us that we would have
[56:52] that
[56:53] characteristic amen amen you guys are
[56:56] quiet
[56:58] tonight
[56:59] amen Satan came to destroy God's
[57:02] creation what God had created to be for
[57:04] himself he had Satan come to destroy
[57:07] this and that's what his purpose was was
[57:09] to destroy it then the battle begin here
[57:12] on Earth and begin in us and has been
[57:14] raging ever since Can someone say Amen
[57:16] to that now before anybody any battle
[57:20] can be put in a ra they first have to
[57:23] choose a meeting ground or place where
[57:25] the battle to be fought a selected place
[57:28] and we know and I'm not going to go on
[57:29] and quote all of this for you but we
[57:32] know what the prophet showed us brought
[57:34] out by Revelation that the mind was the
[57:37] battle place was the Battle Ground that
[57:39] was selected for this age and that's why
[57:42] an intellectual gospel is such a a a a
[57:46] trap for people that when they can come
[57:48] and and quote and explain they feel like
[57:51] they've got it but my brother and sister
[57:53] God said I don't need an INT ual wife I
[57:55] need a wife that loves me amen I need a
[57:58] wife that wants to live the way I want
[58:00] her to live I want her to be my wife
[58:04] amen and I thank God that the word has
[58:08] come there's some soldiers been
[58:12] selected if you'd feel like it tonight
[58:14] maybe you could lift a hand and say
[58:15] thank you Lord for selecting me we've
[58:18] been dressed we've been trained you can
[58:20] go back in paragraph 161 take these
[58:23] words out of it there I believe that God
[58:25] has been selecting his soldiers I
[58:28] believe he's been dressing them and
[58:29] training them and the Battlefront is now
[58:32] set getting ready to start amen I
[58:35] believe this is what's taking place my
[58:37] brother and sister and you know
[58:38] sometimes I just want to say this we
[58:41] don't feel like it's a privilege to be
[58:45] selected because we're facing many great
[58:47] challenges and battles and struggles
[58:49] have you ever thought before like why
[58:52] me certainly I'm not the only one here
[58:56] why me Lord why do I have to go through
[58:58] this battle well God chose you for that
[59:01] battle because he knows you'll overcome
[59:03] that battle amen you're not going to
[59:05] find anywhere in scripture where God
[59:06] chose His People to
[59:08] fail he's always chose them to be
[59:10] victorious to be Overcomers he's always
[59:13] chose them to rise up above the
[59:15] situation that's how God has chose his
[59:18] people
[59:19] right as the prophet has explained amen
[59:22] predestination to us it's not god making
[59:25] us do it but God looking down through
[59:27] time and saying there's my seed that's
[59:30] it there's the life I'm talking about
[59:32] and wherever my life is there is
[59:34] overcoming power and people Rise Up from
[59:38] that why do you
[59:45] believe I had a man once that was
[59:47] walking away from the message was a
[59:49] friend of
[59:51] mine and he kept saying but there's this
[59:53] and there's this and I said and and this
[59:55] and this and you know he said this here
[59:58] and and and one year later he said this
[1:00:00] and they counter dict each other and I
[1:00:02] said I'm sorry that that doesn't matter
[1:00:06] to
[1:00:08] me well how can it not
[1:00:10] matter because he introduced me to Jesus
[1:00:13] Christ is what he said his job
[1:00:15] was well why do you
[1:00:19] believe I can't answer
[1:00:21] that I just do yeah
[1:00:25] I just
[1:00:27] do and maybe my own mind and eyes can
[1:00:30] read and see the very contradiction
[1:00:33] they're talking about on the page here
[1:00:35] and on a page here that it seems like
[1:00:38] it's opposed to each other but my
[1:00:40] brother and sister it wasn't that I was
[1:00:42] looking for a perfect Prophet I was
[1:00:44] looking for the word that a prophet
[1:00:47] bought and that brought and the word is
[1:00:49] perfect amen amen we're not going to
[1:00:52] receive mail at our house anymore more
[1:00:54] because our mailman that delivers it is
[1:00:57] not
[1:00:59] perfect doesn't make sense does
[1:01:03] it people looking for
[1:01:06] perfect when it's the
[1:01:08] message Jesus Christ that is the perfect
[1:01:12] one amen amen you can have an imperfect
[1:01:15] look what history says about some of
[1:01:17] these ministers that brother brandom
[1:01:19] talks about some of them would preach
[1:01:21] Mighty Services people being saved and
[1:01:24] they would go in such a dark tunnel they
[1:01:26] get drunk
[1:01:28] afterwards man I don't want to hear the
[1:01:29] gospel preached by them but he led many
[1:01:32] to the
[1:01:35] Lord does that make the word that he
[1:01:38] preached to them
[1:01:40] flawed flawed vessel not a flawed word
[1:01:44] amen
[1:01:46] amen so this battle that was
[1:01:51] chosen you know sometimes
[1:01:56] well let me just put it this
[1:02:00] way if in choose instead of choosing the
[1:02:04] Mind as a battle
[1:02:06] place maybe we think it'd be simpler if
[1:02:09] it chose some other
[1:02:11] battle maybe the
[1:02:13] heart but you'd get tired of walking
[1:02:16] around holding that Shield over your
[1:02:17] heart all the time you'd complain about
[1:02:19] that
[1:02:21] too Achilles out of what Greek mythology
[1:02:26] or
[1:02:27] whatever if he'd had known an arrow in
[1:02:29] the heel would have killed him he would
[1:02:31] have took a whole different
[1:02:34] stance but my brother and sister it
[1:02:36] wouldn't matter about all of those
[1:02:38] things you can take examples you want
[1:02:40] but God knew that this battle in the
[1:02:43] mind was already
[1:02:46] settled don't be afraid of the battle in
[1:02:48] the mind don't be afraid of what is
[1:02:50] going to take place and how Satan's
[1:02:52] trying to anoint this battle in your
[1:02:54] mind
[1:02:55] remember and recognize this battle is
[1:02:58] already finished amen God declared that
[1:03:01] you are already Victorious that you
[1:03:03] already were the winner and all you had
[1:03:05] to do is trust him so it's really not a
[1:03:08] battle in the mind it's a battle of
[1:03:11] trust amen Satan trying to get us not to
[1:03:14] trust and God declaring to us trust me
[1:03:17] amen you have a battle in the mind you
[1:03:20] feel like you lost it the Lord Jesus
[1:03:23] amen our great king is over here you've
[1:03:27] already overcome trust
[1:03:33] me now I didn't bring that in my notes
[1:03:36] but brother brand I'm speaking about
[1:03:38] that and just studying that today amen
[1:03:40] he's talking about that how it comes
[1:03:42] down to this place that God allowed the
[1:03:45] mind to be chosen but whatever that it
[1:03:48] would have been chosen you would still
[1:03:51] be victorious because he said you would
[1:03:55] be amen hallelujah now I like this also
[1:03:58] in greatest battle ever fought amen we
[1:04:01] look at this and it says now
[1:04:04] Hallelujah do we have a Hallelujah
[1:04:06] tonight Hallelujah we got a festar
[1:04:10] general called
[1:04:12] Jesus placing five stars on us f a i t h
[1:04:17] Faith he's never lost a battle
[1:04:21] Hallelujah he conquered death hell in
[1:04:24] the grave get the Devils out of the way
[1:04:27] amen look at this my brother and sister
[1:04:29] when's the last time when you had a bad
[1:04:31] day that you just said you know what
[1:04:33] devil I'm sorry to ignore
[1:04:37] you but I've got
[1:04:41] faith my general told me I've got faith
[1:04:46] and you know what Satan it sure appears
[1:04:48] that you've kicked me around I've been
[1:04:49] your bean bag today but I'm sorry I'm
[1:04:52] going to ignore you because I I've got
[1:04:54] faith amen my general gave me
[1:04:58] Faith you know I remember that well I
[1:05:00] love history many times through history
[1:05:03] there would be soldiers in the trenches
[1:05:05] and the and the uh the holes and hiding
[1:05:09] behind the trees and the stumps and and
[1:05:11] they don't they don't feel like we can't
[1:05:13] hold out any longer they'd maybe be on
[1:05:15] the radio we can't hold out any longer
[1:05:18] we need to retreat and then one man with
[1:05:22] faith would come and say now look over
[1:05:25] here they've got no one guarding this
[1:05:27] point go attack that point but but no go
[1:05:31] and when they would go the enemy it
[1:05:33] turns out couldn't cover that area and
[1:05:35] they made their objective and when they
[1:05:37] made that objective the enemy said we're
[1:05:40] threatened and the enemy themselves
[1:05:42] start to pull back because they're
[1:05:44] threatened and then when they pulled
[1:05:46] back it gave opportunity for other
[1:05:49] soldiers are you with me tonight other
[1:05:52] soldiers to move up and occupy place
[1:05:54] this is why the body of Believers is
[1:05:57] necessary we're not called to be solo
[1:06:00] cuz when my faith is weak your faith is
[1:06:02] strong and when your faith is weak my
[1:06:05] faith is strong and when we're afraid to
[1:06:07] move forward God sends a great General
[1:06:09] in our midst that says Rise Up take the
[1:06:12] land you are more than
[1:06:16] able this is why it's not about how
[1:06:19] great a Christian we are but it's being
[1:06:21] knit into the body of beli Bel vers into
[1:06:25] the word of God and it being knit into
[1:06:27] us and in our hour of desperation what
[1:06:30] does he do my brother and sister he
[1:06:32] comes and stirs up our Pure Minds in
[1:06:36] remembrance and we remember wait I've
[1:06:39] already won the victory my general has
[1:06:42] declared Us Victorious I'm an overcomer
[1:06:46] and it's come yesterday you look back
[1:06:48] and say it was a bad day but today you
[1:06:50] got up in the morning maybe a midnight
[1:06:53] prayer with tears running down your face
[1:06:55] and you're saying oh Lord why did I say
[1:06:58] that why did I act like that what was a
[1:07:01] why Lord and you wake up in the morning
[1:07:04] and you've got courage and you've got
[1:07:05] faith because God has come in the
[1:07:08] Midnight Hour to remind you you're more
[1:07:10] than an overcomer you can conquer this
[1:07:13] whatever spirit is bothering you might
[1:07:15] be a lying Spirit might be a lost Spirit
[1:07:18] might be a a doubting or fear Spirit God
[1:07:21] says it doesn't matter I come to
[1:07:23] overcome that and you will overcome that
[1:07:26] because I am in you I didn't leave when
[1:07:28] you had that bad thought I didn't leave
[1:07:31] when you kind of tempered the truth a
[1:07:32] little I didn't leave you in this
[1:07:34] circumstance or that circumstance I'm
[1:07:37] here for you amen sorry I'm getting
[1:07:39] excited tonight that's right Hallelujah
[1:07:43] I try not to get this excited at home
[1:07:45] because my office is small and I don't
[1:07:46] want have to rebuild it amen but I tell
[1:07:49] you my brother and sister this great
[1:07:51] Chief captain so the
[1:07:55] devil isn't even the
[1:07:59] picture what would our days be like if
[1:08:01] we just realize the devil's not even in
[1:08:03] our picture
[1:08:07] right sure change life wouldn't it right
[1:08:10] sure change our
[1:08:12] perspective you
[1:08:15] know I've Heard It Through The Years A
[1:08:18] lot of people say well forgive me for
[1:08:20] being so grumpy today I got out of the
[1:08:22] wrong side of the bed
[1:08:24] push that bed against the wall give
[1:08:27] yourself one way out of that
[1:08:29] bed get out on the good
[1:08:31] side see we can offer all kinds of
[1:08:34] excuse well actually we're not offering
[1:08:37] it the Satan's
[1:08:39] there speaking on our
[1:08:42] behalf this is why you're not a
[1:08:44] Victorious
[1:08:46] Christian this is why you're not an
[1:08:48] overcomer this is why you can't seem to
[1:08:51] hold on to
[1:08:52] Victory
[1:08:56] yeah you're
[1:08:57] right seems like every time we have a
[1:08:59] great move now it might not be you guys
[1:09:02] but I I'll just be open enough to tell
[1:09:03] you it happens to me all the time we'll
[1:09:05] have a wonderful awesome experience at
[1:09:09] church and for sure the devil's right
[1:09:12] outside the door to give you the bad
[1:09:15] news right remind you you're not in
[1:09:18] Heavenly places you're a human you're
[1:09:21] carinal well that's not what the word
[1:09:23] says that's right but you see what
[1:09:25] happens is is the word seems to flee
[1:09:28] from
[1:09:28] us reminds me of a
[1:09:31] story in the Vietnam
[1:09:35] War there was I believe a colonel been
[1:09:38] assigned to I I don't remember what size
[1:09:41] a group of
[1:09:42] men they were back East where the I
[1:09:45] think maybe Georgia Carolina humidity
[1:09:48] was terrible all kinds of bugs in the
[1:09:50] woods and he trained his men until they
[1:09:54] literally were talking about we are
[1:09:56] going to frat size or however they say
[1:09:59] that you know we're going to put a
[1:10:01] grenade under his bunk we're going to do
[1:10:03] something get rid of this guy but none
[1:10:05] of them had quite the courage because he
[1:10:07] used to look at him and say I know what
[1:10:08] you're
[1:10:13] thinking and he trained him and trained
[1:10:15] him and trained him until they all
[1:10:16] practically hated him they got to
[1:10:19] Vietnam in the
[1:10:21] jungles and they I'm just going to to
[1:10:23] call it unit because I don't remember
[1:10:25] just how big a group it was and one of
[1:10:29] the lowest stood the fiercest of combat
[1:10:33] and had one of the lowest rates of of
[1:10:37] uh um my brain just went
[1:10:40] dead
[1:10:42] casualties one of the lowest rates of
[1:10:45] casualties and in this writing they
[1:10:47] interviewed many soldiers that were in
[1:10:49] his deal when they come back from
[1:10:50] Vietnam and many of these men years
[1:10:53] later when they would see him with with
[1:10:55] tears running down their face and they
[1:10:57] would introduce a wife and children and
[1:11:02] grandchildren and say I'd have none of
[1:11:05] this if it hadn't been for you training
[1:11:11] us look you get to be my age my brother
[1:11:13] and
[1:11:14] sister and we look back and see the
[1:11:17] grace of God that we have children and
[1:11:20] we have grandchildren serving God and we
[1:11:24] would not have that if it hadn't been
[1:11:26] for God training us showing us the way
[1:11:31] to be
[1:11:31] Overcomers oh Lord help us amen help us
[1:11:35] Lord amen he's a great Chief Captain so
[1:11:39] the devil isn't even in the
[1:11:42] picture amen what place are we being
[1:11:45] called
[1:11:46] to the place where we believe every
[1:11:50] word we can say we believe every word
[1:11:54] are you with me tonight am I being too
[1:11:56] too rough on
[1:11:57] you my brother and sister we we talk
[1:12:00] about I believe every
[1:12:02] word but then we get in the
[1:12:04] battle and it really shows whether we
[1:12:06] believe every word
[1:12:09] right Hallelujah I mean we hear the
[1:12:13] testimonies wonderful testimonies I got
[1:12:15] my own testimony of losing my wallet
[1:12:17] once in Albuquerque New
[1:12:20] Mexico calling the wife in the middle of
[1:12:23] the night I've got a disaster all my
[1:12:24] fuel money credit cards driver's license
[1:12:27] medical cards all I've lost it can't
[1:12:30] find it God standing on his word a
[1:12:34] promise where the Prophet God talks
[1:12:35] about pocketknife and in the middle of
[1:12:37] the night I got desperate and got down
[1:12:39] and just cried tears Lord forgive me for
[1:12:41] my lack of faith my brother and sister
[1:12:44] at wallet went home with me amen it
[1:12:46] wasn't lost and found or some thief in a
[1:12:49] garbage can or something that wallet
[1:12:51] Come Back to Me by the grace of God and
[1:12:53] it's not us it's him but we have to
[1:12:56] learn to trust him amen and he brings us
[1:12:59] to a place that he's proving whether we
[1:13:01] believe every word or not oh I tell you
[1:13:04] it can be hard it can be bitter it might
[1:13:05] cause you to have great tears great
[1:13:08] sorrow but God is faithful amen if we'll
[1:13:11] trust him he'll perform now I'm going to
[1:13:15] move forward in questions and answers
[1:13:17] here amen we want to believe every word
[1:13:20] now this might be confusing and I hope
[1:13:21] it isn't to you but um I've been accused
[1:13:25] of having a terrible habit of
[1:13:26] cherry-picking quotes and that's exactly
[1:13:28] what I did right here is I cherry-picked
[1:13:30] this quote right out so now it's
[1:13:33] question and answers and people are
[1:13:34] asking a marriage and divorce question
[1:13:38] but it's not about marriage and divorce
[1:13:39] that got my attention it was the words
[1:13:42] that the prophet of God says now they're
[1:13:44] saying should I come and be married
[1:13:46] again and he says if you wish to but
[1:13:48] this is where I want to start if you
[1:13:50] don't mind my cherry
[1:13:52] picking
[1:13:54] don't have nothing in your mind that
[1:13:58] bothers your faith amen because if
[1:14:01] anything's there you can go no further
[1:14:04] than right there amen you stop right
[1:14:07] there when that question mark come
[1:14:10] that's where you end right there but now
[1:14:13] for me and then he's going back to
[1:14:15] marriage and divorce it would be all
[1:14:17] right I want to ask how many times have
[1:14:22] we come to the place
[1:14:24] of the
[1:14:25] question that's
[1:14:29] right you didn't run out to the
[1:14:31] movies you weren't drinking
[1:14:34] liquor you weren't doing all kinds of
[1:14:36] things that we might describe as
[1:14:38] Sin but the prophet of God says you
[1:14:41] stopped right there look how clever
[1:14:45] Satan is bring us to a place that a
[1:14:49] question mark in our mind stops us from
[1:14:52] moving forward
[1:14:53] into the deeper things of God somebody
[1:14:57] says well well you know we don't believe
[1:14:59] in that puts question mark there that's
[1:15:02] all Satan's got to do we go no
[1:15:07] further I don't know if any of you been
[1:15:10] there I've been
[1:15:12] there I've been there where I realized I
[1:15:14] was just so to speak parked on the side
[1:15:16] of the road going no
[1:15:22] further
[1:15:23] don't have nothing in your mind that
[1:15:26] bothers your faith what does that mean
[1:15:29] means you got to cast down imagination
[1:15:31] you got to cast down emotion you got to
[1:15:34] cast down intellectual understanding a
[1:15:36] lot of things we have to cast down that
[1:15:38] are there to hinder us going
[1:15:41] forward right but God come to deliver
[1:15:46] now I'm going to put this if you don't
[1:15:47] mind me switching directions here real
[1:15:52] quick remember that guy named
[1:15:55] L got moved down
[1:15:57] there got him a nice you might say
[1:16:00] little Mansion right there on the street
[1:16:03] and sod him life was good he was a man
[1:16:07] of authority a position it put his wife
[1:16:10] in a position not a bad position a good
[1:16:13] position as far as the world
[1:16:15] thought
[1:16:16] and you know God speaks to lot the
[1:16:20] Angels come and tell him to leave
[1:16:25] Lot's wife
[1:16:27] never put that question to
[1:16:31] rest she's there the Angels literally
[1:16:33] have to push her out of
[1:16:36] town now I hope you can move this over
[1:16:38] into the other side of the
[1:16:41] equation the Angels basically have to
[1:16:44] push her out of town drag her out of
[1:16:46] town and because she actually never
[1:16:50] settled the question of whether the word
[1:16:52] that came to her was God's word or not
[1:16:56] you really that's what it come down to
[1:16:58] Saints it wasn't about how how nice a
[1:17:01] house she had nice clothes she had and
[1:17:03] position in church and this that and the
[1:17:05] other she came down whether she believed
[1:17:08] this really was God's word or not
[1:17:12] right and you know as she went out of
[1:17:17] town we're going back now to our title
[1:17:20] The Great
[1:17:22] Escape
[1:17:23] she never got that question put to rest
[1:17:25] and as she's now on her way to
[1:17:29] escape really what happened was is this
[1:17:32] is Paul's text don't take it as some
[1:17:35] kind of
[1:17:36] Doctrine but you see because she never
[1:17:39] settled
[1:17:41] it she was looking back trying to find
[1:17:45] an
[1:17:51] answer why couldn't God just let me stay
[1:17:55] here why can't I just continue to live
[1:17:58] in Sodom we've never heard of a whole
[1:18:01] city going up in
[1:18:04] fire a pastor down at the first church
[1:18:08] says she's caught in this battle in her
[1:18:12] mind because she had no absolute she had
[1:18:17] no answer she just kind of was like okay
[1:18:22] come on Saints I'll just be honest with
[1:18:23] you I sat in church in years past heard
[1:18:26] the preaching of the word and said to
[1:18:29] myself that's their
[1:18:32] opinion only to find out later in my
[1:18:35] life that wasn't their opinion that was
[1:18:38] the
[1:18:39] word and I was questioning the word
[1:18:42] because I had no
[1:18:44] answer and I voted for the side of I
[1:18:49] sure
[1:18:50] miss Sodom
[1:18:53] but God rich in
[1:18:56] mercy God rich in Mercy never let me get
[1:18:59] turned completely back to
[1:19:02] look and while she's trying to find a
[1:19:05] balance in her life she
[1:19:08] stops against the command of an angel of
[1:19:13] God and looks
[1:19:16] back and they're certain that that
[1:19:18] pillar of salt on the side of that
[1:19:19] mountain is
[1:19:21] her the time the place everything why a
[1:19:26] Time tested Memorial don't look back
[1:19:29] don't look back don't look back look
[1:19:32] forward if God sent you forward then
[1:19:35] he's made the way for you to go forward
[1:19:38] he doesn't open the door for you to go
[1:19:40] forward to have you pry the door open to
[1:19:43] go back amen when God calls us forward
[1:19:47] let's go forward amen and so it's there
[1:19:51] we look at this amen she she never put
[1:19:54] that question to rest and I say to young
[1:19:56] and old here tonight we need to settle
[1:19:59] the question we either are going to
[1:20:01] believe and trust God's word or we're
[1:20:03] going to always be looking back trying
[1:20:05] to figure out what did I leave behind
[1:20:07] what opportunity I'll tell you about a
[1:20:09] young man in Chile he's a very handsome
[1:20:12] young man very athletic young man I mean
[1:20:15] very athletic and he he was raised up in
[1:20:18] Venezuela and and his dad was a pastor
[1:20:21] in a message Church in venezuel
[1:20:23] and this young man incredibly gifted
[1:20:27] soccer
[1:20:28] player and as he was playing his way up
[1:20:31] through at you know his young age he was
[1:20:34] being invited to go up two or three
[1:20:36] levels in the league to play and here he
[1:20:38] is amongst guys way taller than him but
[1:20:40] he was fast he was Nimble he he was
[1:20:42] accurate and and they kept boosting him
[1:20:44] and moving him and moving him and he
[1:20:46] come up at the college level and one day
[1:20:49] a man
[1:20:50] comes and and says we want before you
[1:20:54] get out here and everybody has a shot at
[1:20:56] you we want you to come to Spain now if
[1:20:59] you guys know anything about soccer you
[1:21:01] know who plays in Spain it's called
[1:21:05] Madrid and they took him there and they
[1:21:09] showed him everything a house an
[1:21:11] apartment a car and under the rules that
[1:21:13] there is certain caps and stuff none of
[1:21:15] this belongs to you none of it's a gift
[1:21:17] to you but uh this little piece of
[1:21:19] plastic will buy anything you want and
[1:21:21] gasoline and this and that and this
[1:21:23] position now these are the words they
[1:21:25] spoke to him and this position will get
[1:21:27] you all the women in your life that you
[1:21:35] want he toured the facilities they whed
[1:21:38] and
[1:21:39] dined he goes
[1:21:42] home but he had a
[1:21:45] father that was settled in the word had
[1:21:48] his mind made up had the courage to look
[1:21:51] his son in the face face and tell him if
[1:21:55] you take that
[1:21:56] contract you will never serve
[1:22:03] God he struggled over that they kept
[1:22:06] asking for an answer and he kept telling
[1:22:07] them I don't have an answer yet you need
[1:22:09] to give us an answer you need to give us
[1:22:11] an answer need to give us an answer
[1:22:13] we'll tell you what we'll do we'll keep
[1:22:15] you in the Venezuelan League here which
[1:22:17] was a very elite league right below the
[1:22:19] pros we'll keep you here for a while so
[1:22:22] you can kind of untie yourself from your
[1:22:24] family and all this stuff it happens all
[1:22:26] the time no problem and and and he was
[1:22:29] there struggling over that and his
[1:22:31] father's words echoing in his
[1:22:33] mind and he woke up one
[1:22:36] day and said I have to serve
[1:22:39] God I have
[1:22:41] to you know what they told him when he
[1:22:44] told them he wasn't accepting
[1:22:47] it they said you are
[1:22:51] insane you're going to go to church and
[1:22:55] serve
[1:22:56] God instead of
[1:22:58] wealth and
[1:23:01] women you're
[1:23:04] insane who's the crazy
[1:23:08] one what happened God settled that Amen
[1:23:12] in his heart amen that was settled that
[1:23:15] was finished no amount no amount of
[1:23:19] money he was in Spain on that trip they
[1:23:22] were just just stuffing handfuls of cash
[1:23:25] in his pockets wooing him I'll tell you
[1:23:28] the devil knows how to woo that's right
[1:23:30] it might not be a lot of cash it might
[1:23:32] not be that but there'll be something
[1:23:33] that the devil sees and he's doing his
[1:23:35] wooing but when we come to the place my
[1:23:38] brother and sister the bride of Christ
[1:23:40] got her mind made up amen and she is
[1:23:42] settled on who she is and why she is
[1:23:45] here and the devil can't offer enough of
[1:23:48] his treasure to take God's treasure away
[1:23:51] from you amen
[1:23:54] hallelujah but look at that going back
[1:23:56] to Lot's wife see she was trying to
[1:23:58] answer the question looking
[1:24:01] back why am I leaving should I leave
[1:24:05] will I be better off if I
[1:24:06] leave is this really God's word for
[1:24:11] me got to thinking about what she had to
[1:24:13] leave
[1:24:21] behind
[1:24:26] well turn the computer on this
[1:24:29] morning sat down in the
[1:24:32] chair opened up the internet and went to
[1:24:35] the
[1:24:37] news I'm ready to leave it
[1:24:40] behind I'm ready to leave it behind it's
[1:24:43] it's
[1:24:44] Insanity it's
[1:24:47] Insanity that's what's here isn't that
[1:24:49] what the prophet told us it would be 50
[1:24:53] years ago 60 years ago he said it's
[1:24:56] going to be as they're though
[1:25:02] insane we got trillions of dollars of
[1:25:07] budget trillions of dollars of budget
[1:25:11] deficit and we're printing money and
[1:25:13] giving it
[1:25:15] away but don't worry about it the
[1:25:17] prophet of God said United States is
[1:25:19] already bankrupt 1965
[1:25:23] so don't worry about it just scripture
[1:25:25] coming to pass yes sir amen that's right
[1:25:29] you've got to settle
[1:25:31] it in your mind that's it amen there's
[1:25:35] where it has come down you say it's a
[1:25:37] heart issue yes it is but if the mind is

[1:25:56] via and uh sister Vanessa would come
[1:25:59] play for
[1:26:01] us because let us settle this in our
[1:26:04] mind now once and forever there's only
[1:26:07] one way to have life that's right and to
[1:26:10] know him is life that's the only way we
[1:26:12] can have life and no other way for God
[1:26:14] has only promised life through Jesus
[1:26:17] Christ and the great Jehovah without
[1:26:19] beginning or without ending without
[1:26:20] without beginning of days or ending of
