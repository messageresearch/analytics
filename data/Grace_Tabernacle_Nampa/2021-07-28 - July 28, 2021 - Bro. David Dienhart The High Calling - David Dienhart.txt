are standing in your presence because you said this when two or three gathered in your name you'll be among us and so many times you proved this so many times you took circumstances it was so impossible in our eyes in our eyes it was like a desert but your eyes it was just one step from the beautiful garden dear lord you know all these burdens that we have in our hearts you know all circumstances and we cast everything before you lord you said in your word even before we ask you know you know the how to fulfill this situation and we pray about sister emmy we pray about brother david we know all all hell all devils try to put efforts to stop saints from preaching your word [Music] we pray lord please be among us we need you we need you even more every single day because we see how hell is coming in front of us but we also see how heavens come stuck heaven coming out coming down lord we love you we love you more and more [Music] we pray about this service we came in front of you lord you know our heart our desires and we thank you we thank you for everything you has already done for us we pray about all of these sins in your precious name of the lord jesus christ amen [Music] internet joining us it's good to have you with us again just a reminder i'm such a creature of happiness i'm gonna make my announcement again uh songbook so if you just think of a song that we've seen and maybe i'm not singing the verses in the verses because i've got notes from the whole thing there's verses to this song and i just need to go find them so if you can get those to me in the next month i would appreciate it that way i can reprint my book and it's literally falling apart and i need to make a new one so this is a good time to do it amen let's sing number 543 let's talk about jesus amen as we get ready to turn the service of brother david as he would come this awesome let's talk about jesus the king of kings is he the lord of lords free throughout eternity [Music] let's talk about jesus more [Music] let's talk about jesus let all the world proclaim the power and majesty of [Music] let's sing his praises [Music] let's talk about jesus the bread of life is he the savior of the world of galilee a prophet praise the king the mining god is he a well obliving let's talk about jesus the prince of jesus christ [Music] such [Music] [Music] the word of god supply is [Music] [Music] our hallelujah you can't talk about jesus enough because every time you talk about him every time you meditate on him he comes near you draw an eye to god and he'll draw night to you amen i think that ought to be our conversation more and more is on him is on his goodness on his word which he is you know that he is the word we say i believe jesus then you believe the word how can you do one without the other see he's the same you can't you can't separate our lord jesus from his word he said i'll serve him then here's the word you see god's word is enough amen god's word is enough what god said in his word he's going to keep his word he's obligated to his word and if you came from him and a part of him and he's the word then you are become the word and so how can he turn his word down what a consolation when we know we are in him and he in us amen amen i thank the lord for the opportunity to god bless you dismissed amen i don't mean dismiss it's not a classroom but you go in the corner no no no no no no no we don't want to get in the corner if we're getting the corner god will get us out all right sometimes it's good to be in the corner we need those corners amen something tonight that it's almost like i'm calling this three different subjects three different topics through different titles and yet it's a strange way that the lord has led me to go this way and it may seem strange in the way it's brought but i know that this is god directing it and i can do only one thing follow him i don't know there don't i don't know how he's going to put it together how it'll be but i believe it'll speak to your heart if you'll just let him do it i believe it spoke to mine i know to speak to yours and it will continue to speak to mine amen has it trusted it speaks to you amen there's some things here i've got to read i'll do quite a bit of reading and i that's a little out of character for me i don't like to do that there's times when i will do that but please don't turn yourself off right now amen you can feel i just turn i'll turn him off i'm tired i've had a busy day you know i'm not going to listen now i want you to listen because the only way i know to bring this is the way god said to bring it and he showed me to bring it so i got to bring it that way so any minister will do the same thing we're all different god didn't put us in a in a in a uh yeah cookie cutter and made us all the same you're right brother it's a cookie cutter no we're not we are members in particular set aside particular under a certain measure of god and he can only follow as he leads i want to call this the the main title i'm calling it here is the high calling the high calling but underneath that is perfect strength by perfect weakness and then if i have time and may touch this at the end consider your ways so it seems strange the way that we're bringing this but but god have his way he's calling for you tonight i believe that we're not here by chance i believe that god brought us into this this building god's given us the opportunity to be here satan would have liked to kept you from coming because you've come to hear the word you haven't come to see or hear a man i don't think we ought to come to church at any time to hear what a man has to say we want to hear what god has to say through that man we must submit ourselves to him amen there's no flesh will glory in his presence how many believe you're in his presence amen then there's no glory that's gonna there's no flesh excuse me that will glory in his presence amen god works through flesh but he doesn't bring glory to the flesh amen but he gets glory to himself it's god's way to speak through man amen and i'm not just saying just ministry only i'm talking about every member of the body of christ man or woman god speaks through the housewife god speaks to the the the mother god speaks to the daddy god speaks to the husband god speaks remember every member of the body and its measure will speak because it is the blood speaking god speaks through that amen every member every member of the body is the blood of jesus christ by the spirit god has one place that he put his name and that's one place is where you've got to worship him and that's in christ there's only one true worship one place of true worship that's in christ we can only give in christ by by the true baptism of the holy spirit can we be placed in that position amen and when we're in that position then the word becomes quickened to us alive to us amen because it takes the spirit of god to quicken the word of god amen amen amen so we then the bride lives and and every member lives by revelation and that's not of ourselves it is the gift of god amen amen all right so he's calling you for you tonight i want you to know we're not here by chance we're here to hear his call and he's speaking to individuals bride is individual members amen amen so so he's here calling for you tonight to the high calling to a high calling to the high calling how many believes calling you to a high calling we have the bride has in this hour and day in which we are in we are here brought in this hour to manifest the word for the hour we weren't here to manifest the word for another hour but for this hour amen and and it's a high calling the bride has the highest calling there is in the land amen she she's not just a fly by night she is god's wife she has a very high calling and we ought to conduct ourselves and i say god help us to remember to so submit ourselves to god and help us to live a life worthy of that call of that calling because we are have a high calling and so he's calling for you tonight to the high calling of perfect strength by perfect weakness amen of perfect strength by perfect weakness amen so i pray that after tonight you'll realize that you begin as paul said to glory in your weakness because unless you become weak you're in the way of god using you amen that's right because god uses weaklings he doesn't use man's knowledge and his ability of what he's learned god will not use it i i've i've got it's not a not just a statement here he uses himself when he called moses after he got moses to the place where he was so insufficient he made excuses for his weaknesses that he stood before that pillar of fire he said god i can't speak i can't talk i stutter i'm not eloquent i don't i don't have an ability i'm this i'm that i'm this and that and god's exactly where i want you and he meant to meet that light to anoint that something in him that god himself placed there so that god himself could come down and use himself he had to make a weakling so god could take what's in you and use it he has to take himself and uses himself now that's that's the that is the path of every true believer amen is that you have to become a complete weakling and and a total complete submission i'm going to come back on the surrender and submission here seem like every service now for the last several i've been on on on surrender submission and and committing and committal it takes submission god's looking for a wife that will submit herself completely everything she is everything she ever was all about it and realize that god deals with her sovereignly individually and that as a member of his body he has a right to do with his instruments as he desires is that right do you believe he's sovereign there's one thing god will not do is lead you off of his word but he can do whatever he wants to do in manifesting and completing that word in your life and he will do it through scars and trials and testings and and all these things he will bring about redemption in your life to show that it had nothing to do with you it has everything to do with him because without those scars and those trials and those tests he can't show character he won't pull out his character he has that in you does that with you to bring out his character and i'm a little ahead of myself here but i'll just just continue on here so god is calling for a complete surrender he's calling for a complete submission and yielding of your weaknesses to him of your weakness to him brother branham said if we have weakness we have strength if we have weakness we have strength all right philippians 3 14 if you'd stand with me take your bibles philippians 3 14. and then i want to go to second corinthians chapter 12 in hebrews 11. philippians 3 verse 14 and i think we'll begin reading well that's not the one i wanted yes it is i'm sorry yes let's start up here with verse 10 that i may know him and notice that's not that's a revelation that's revelation that i may know him and the power of his resurrection and the fellowship of his sufferings being made conformable unto his death if by any means i might attain unto the resurrection of the dead not as though i had already attained neither were already perfect but i follow after if that i may apprehend for that which also i am apprehended of christ jesus brethren i count not myself to have apprehended but this one thing i do forgetting those things which are in are behind or in the past as brother brown boys say forgetting those things which are behind amen and reaching forth unto those things which are before forgetting the things behind reaching forth unto those things which are before i press not just a casual walk but a walk of trials testings pressures persecutions everything goes into that in obtaining that goal you have to walk through every bit of it amen you say well if i made perfect why i would have to go through that because god wants to show redemption he wants to show his attributes of a savior a healer a deliverer amen that's all of what it's all about amen you wonder why i have the scars after this service i hope you quit you quit making your scars your excuses but making your uh your failures your excuses so i failed this i failed that we all failed something amen but god doesn't fail the prophet said that faith in you cannot fail the holy spirit in you cannot fail the revelation of the word cannot fail the revelation of jesus christ in you cannot fail who you really are cannot fail amen that's right all right so now i press toward the mark the mark the goal i press toward the mark or the goal for the prize the reward the prize are you expecting a reward yeah we are we say well i lord i you're the one and you know what we're gonna we're gonna bow before him and place those rewards right down at his feet again because without him we wouldn't have any reward he already purpose reward brought you through everything to give you the reward amen is that right he's the one that's done that every bit of it amen right so he loves to show himself and without without see right at the very beginning without abraham with i'm excuse me without uh adam falling he wouldn't be able to show his attributes amen but he can't lose what's himself amen that's right all right i pressed toward the mark the goal for the prize of the high calling of god in christ jesus amen of the high calling all right then i'd like you to go with me to second corinthians chapter 12. verse 9 and he said unto me my grace is sufficient for thee my grace is sufficient for thee is there any these here tonight my grace is sufficient for thee for my strength is made perfect is made perfect in weakness paul said most gladly therefore will i rather glory in my infirmities not hate them not make excuses for them but glory in them now that's contrary to human he and you will not want to glorify every one of them through faith subdued kingdoms wrought righteousness obtain promises stop the mouths of lions quenched the violence of fire escaped the edge of the sword out of weakness were made strong waxed valiant in fight f-i-g-h-t turned to flight the armies of the aliens amen amen you may be seated jesus himself jesus as a man was and had to learn human weakness because the bible said the bible said that he let's just turn to it in hebrews 5 just the pages back if you still have hebrews open turn back here to hebrews 5 and look here at this seventh verse who in the days of his flesh when he had offered up prayers and supplications with strong crying and tears unto him that was able to save him from death and was heard in that he feared though he were a son yet learned he obedience and you look that word up obedience that word obedience means submission learned he obedience or submission by the things which he suffered amen so he also could do nothing jesus said himself i in my own self can do nothing amen he was unless god showed him what to do unless god moved upon him what to do and the same thing applies to him every member of his body he could do nothing in himself amen all right so so he see we see here that and being perfect he became the author of eternal salvation unto all them that obey him and if he learned obedience or submission through what he suffered and become perfect then then there's none perfect but god and yet we are to be perfect as our father in heaven is perfect then we are going to learn the same thing amen through suffering through trials through scars through pressures amen and we can learn and realize these things are for our good because god has control over those things amen he's not going to bring anything upon you but what you can bear is that right he's not going to do anything but what has got to work together for your good period all things work together for good to them that love god to them that are the called according to his purpose he's going to work his purpose but he's sovereign and how he wants to work it scars trials has nothing to do with the seal that god's placed in you in him amen because when we enter into his rest amen we have ceased from our labors then let's let god have his way and when we face these things let's remember we have his word of promise to take a hold of and pass right on through it because his grace is sufficient amen amen if god allowed it brother brahm said god give me grace to go through it i'll hold steady with your word that's it amen the word alone not adding your reasoning not adding your feeling to it but the word alone take what the word said alone and stand on the word quit trying to put your opinion to it god don't need an opinion god's word is perfect okay brother branham said this and i'm going to quote a lot of things out of here because i i just don't know what else how else to do it but on the message perfect strength by perfect weakness he said the pastor and to the children all may we be able to lay ourselves aside on the altar of god and open our hearts and listen to the holy spirit as he'll speak to us and i say may that be so tonight i don't believe these things are just read by chance this is this is directed and he's going to speak directly to all of us are you willing to let him do that all right we try to make our weaknesses excuses we try to make our weaknesses excuses therefore so many there's so many of us likes to testify or likes to think we're insufficient and therefore we make that an excuse i have no education i have no ability i'm not able to do this if you keep that up and do it in that way keep going like that then you can't amount to anything but the very thing that we make excuses by our weaknesses god uses the very thing to tackle the job with see he waits for us to get to that condition he waits for us and and there's points here i want to make out as i come to him i want to stress those areas he he waits for us to get to that condition so that he can use this all right well i i'm not i can't do this i'm insufficient i can't do it and god takes the very thing to do the job with that's true that's the reason why he chose us what what did he choose how did he why did why did he choose us because we're in the condition of weakness amen i've got a scripture we got a scripture on it god the prophet the bible said he chose the weak things amen amen are you with me he chose them he knew that before the foundation of the world okay so he said the reason he cho that's the reason that he chose us because we're in that condition now that sounds strange he said but we'll we'll find a few minutes get the reason of god willing weakness and rejections we find that those people who are the weakest and the rejected by the outside world is god's heroes amen that conquer up in the front line they're the conquering ones why because they're not depending on themselves i can't depend on myself myself will trick myself the greatest enemy i've got we'll find where brother brown says the same thing but the greatest enemy i've got is david dean heart you put your name in amen but the beauty of it is the greatest enemy i've got is defeated then we ought to reckon him defeated amen are you with me amen all right we ought to reckon the bible said reckon ourselves dead indeed unto sin all right now so he said the weakness he said if god be willing that he said god's heroes that conquer up in the front line it takes those who feel themselves unworthy oh how the devil jumps on that you ever have the devil jump on that when you felt like you're just unworthy you just why you must not be anything you'd be this and that way watch him turn that around amen then if you start knowing you're unworthy and no you can't do it start depending on god watch the devil fight that well you did this you did that you can't be you can't be a christian all right now we just received the if there's a minister's come to him and brother brown refers to this i'm trying to cut these down as much as we can we just received the holy ghost shall we now seek for gifts for our ministry the prophet said don't you do it let it alone amen well i just read in the book they said the brothers book told us after we received the holy ghost we should seek gifts to use the holy ghost i said and become a stuffed shirt if you'll notice in the bible it's always those who who are trying to get away from that that god uses as long as a man wants to do something and thinks he's got enough ability he can put the job over god could never use that man as long as a man thinks he can has the ability and can put the job over god will never use that man that thinks he can do it he's got to realize he can't do it you cannot truly surrender yourself to god until you come to that place all right so he says here i said look he said look at the man running look god could never use that man look at moses running look at paul running and the rest i'm trying to get away from it yeah moses ran out of the wilderness to get away from it he failed well my failure my goodness assad said that's just what i wanted to do so i could get him cured up teach him some weakness he was a scholar man next pharaoh talk about depending on your strength if anybody had strength to depend on it would have been moses and paul is that right in the scriptures but they forgot they had that they had to be they had to be uh whipped out they had to find they found themselves in the dust they had to learn human weakness and so he said i said don't seek nothing god's got anything for you he'll give it to you look how simple if god's got anything for you he'll give it to you and just let him take care of that just let him take care of it i said then you get some of these times like we got have today that everybody's wanting to do this and that and become some great person look what we got is into with it you see instead of trying to be great we ought to be trying to find out how little we can get my my mind isn't that lovely you know i think it's lovely because god can express himself that's my desire personally i want him to express himself to the hour and the time and the message of the hour let me become that manifestation i sure can't do it by depending on myself i have nothing to depend on but i can he can do it and he will do it and he promised to do it you want to remember that nobody can take your position in the body of christ i'm speaking to believers tonight i'm not speaking to just people i'm speaking to believers bride nobody's going to take your position there's not enough devils in hell can knock you out of your position it may look like nothing to you but it's great in god's sight there's no such thing as big and little in god's sight because it's all himself working now you tell me how you can chop up god big and little you can't do it all right so i said just see how little you can get then god can use you now listen to what the it's like i said a gift is not something you take like a knife you want to cut this with it you can cut it or you can cut this you can cut it cut that or whatever you want to that's not a gift of god see no that's not a gift of god he says it's like i said uh no i said excuse me a gift of god is some way you have of getting yourself out of the way and gifts and callings are predestinated predestin are the predestination of god gifts and callings are with are even without repentance so you're not saved by a gift because i minister the word i'm not saved by ministry i have a choice to minister not a minister and god showed me will be unto me if i don't so i have a choice though i can do so or i don't have to do so and if i choose not to do so a dispensation of the gospel that i would have ministered to is going to be held against me and be counted to my hand so see we got a choice and i say but god it's your gift now watch what the prophet continues to say and it's the way with everyone ministry i'm talking about but also as a member of the body now watch this he said he said you are born with it give some calling without repent you are born with it a little gear you pull yourself over in but you cannot step on the pedal anybody's minister very long knows they can't step on the pedal but somehow when you get up here giving yourself to god god steps on the pedal and you say things you didn't even think you would say and it flows right together okay but watch he said a little gear you pull yourself but you cannot step on the pedal god has to operate it you have to get yourself out of the way you do not pump it up pull it up join it go into something to learn how to use it you don't learn how to use god you don't learn as when you begin to learn how to do something and say god here's something i learned i know i can use it for your glory he has no you ha he will not be able to use that ability you're out of the will of god doing it amen you watch what the prophet said i believe the prophet said okay then listen listen carefully tonight all right now you can't pump it up join it you can't learn how to use it they tell you how to use it there in some seminary school well you have to receive the holy well yeah well you if you have received the holy spirit we believe that but you you do it this way but you see there's no control of it you see psychology only deals in one facet of your being it's the intellectual side it's not the soul realm all right because there's only one thing that's going to deal and deliver you in the soul realm and that's the word of god for the season by revelation that's all amen you can't do nothing you try to do something in your own self it won't work or it may look like it works but it won't be amount to anything by faith they did this by faith by faith by faith by faith by faith every bit of it was by faith your confession should be by faith amen okay all right now he said god has to operate it okay he said but you see you have no control over it you don't use the holy spirit you don't use the holy spirit the holy spirit uses you amen the holy spirit uses you see you're not you're not to use the holy spirit you're not to use the holy spirit the holy spirit's got you a gift is not something you take like a knife and a sharp and pencil with it it's yielding yourself to god getting yourself out of the way so they let the holy spirit use you and if he uses you it'll be with the word and if you can't discern what's with the word or not you need the holy spirit all right amen all right now a gift is not something you take okay see it's like a knife it's yielding yourself to god getting yourself out of the way so the holy spirit can use you now i just thought i'd drop that in now let's continue on here on this message those are other messages he spoke that in but this coming back to perfect strength and perfect weakness notice that it takes the weakest it takes notice he said it takes the weakest and rejected and practically every hero god ever had in the front line was that type of person a person that was rejected a person that thought he was insufficient a person that had no ability at all then that's just that's the person just in good shape so god can start using them that's right when they feel like they can't they haven't got nothing that's when god can take a hold of them and do something with them but when we are thinking but when we are thinking now watch that word thinking but when we are thinking that we're able to do it then god can't use us because we are wanting to do it i think this is timely all right even though it's brought out a little different maybe you're used to but it's just lessons here tonight and god wanted you to sit here and hear it i don't mean to be out harsh but i'm that positive all right now he said because we're wanting to do it i've worked out the next word ourselves first corinthians chapter one let's go over there just a moment first corinthians 1 chapter 1 and verse 20 26 for you see your calling brother and how that not many wise men after the flesh not not not many dd ldds and this and that and somebody just studied and said this is the way to bring the spirit under under control nonsense there's only one way to bring the spirit under control that's by the power and revelation of the word amen by the spirit of god all right but god he said for you see your calling brother not many wise men after the flesh not many mighty men not many noble are called but god hath chosen the foolish things of the world to confound the wise god hath chosen the weak things of the world to confound the things which are mighty and the base things of the world and things which are despised have god chosen yea and things which are not to bring to not things that are that no flesh shall glory in his presence amen amen and he says now on the other side we get these feelings we think that we're insufficient we don't want to do it but if we just listen to the call of god that's the very thing god wants us to get into that kind of a shape so he can oh my amen god's working on me god is working on me to make me what i ought to be what what how what am i ought to be himself made manifest in flesh amen all right he said we when we are insufficient ourselves watch this quote i love this when we are insuffic anybody insufficient yourself okay that's wonderful see he loves to hear you confess it [Laughter] that's right when we are insufficient ourselves and we are subjects to yield to god's spirit my amen when we are insufficient ourselves we are subjects to yield to god's spirit as long as we think that we can do it then we can't do it but when we get to a place where we know no we can't do it then we yield ourselves to god and he does it amen remember god does not use educated theology and man's uh wisdom and and the ability of human men he can't use it amen now that audit that ought to shake some people to the roots because it's upsetting their very thought because it upsets denominationalism it upsets the spirit of denominationalism it upsets that female dominating spirit ever learning never able to come to the knowledge of the truth uh-huh you see what i'm saying all right all right now now then if it then if it's us trying to do it we'll fail but if we'll just yield ourself to god then god can't fail there's one thing god cannot do did you know there's something god cannot do how about young people did you know there's something god can't not do you say do all things oh there's something he cannot do that's fail and god is the word now which side would you rather be on his or yours he's given you opportunity to receive him so which side would you rather be on his or yours yours is failed yours has already failed his never did fail can't fail never will fail amen that's right and he's invited you to come through the blood amen you feel that tug in you then yield to it amen yield to that pull yield to that tug i want jesus christ but what will my friends think die to your friends die to what they think what difference does it make what they think are you going to allow them to keep you out of the kingdom amen you have everything at your disposal draw an eye to god draw night to him and hide just draw nigh to him through the bible draw nigh to him through the message of the hour you get to business individually with god yourself amen you're not too young to get to business with god start feeding on his word start asking god to reveal his word to you personally reveal himself in you personally he wants you to ask him he's given you the way out he's given you the way out of this chaos and into his presence amen personally personally he's caring about you personally okay now so long as we're trying in ourselves the only thing see all we're trying ourselves and depending on our own abilities and so forth we'll do nothing but when we get to a place where we know we're nothing that's the great thing when we get to a place where we know we're nothing we don't focus on the things we don't focus on nothing we focus on something why focus on nothing when you can focus on something a real so therefore though for therefore we are not focusing on the things which are are temporal but on the things eternal the eternal's more real than the temporal did you know that the things unseen which is the eternal is more real than the things that are seen where is your focus today today tonight where's your focus where's your desire laying on what you see and whether whatever others that you think they see in you our dwelling our focus is not on human it's on eternal word it's not on the on the outer man it's on the eternal word of the inner man it's upon christ himself that's more real because everything that you see came from a creation from an eternal so what's more real the eternal or the things you see that are passing amen amen all right my absolute my absolute isn't upon the the the temporal my absolute is on the eternal what's real is his revelation of himself in me it in you that you're where your trust is amen right all right now okay now i'm gonna as long as you're trying in yourselves and depending on your own abilities and so forth you'll do nothing but when you get who you say well brother david ah well what do you mean nothing in whose eyes are we measuring this uh by it's measured by god's sight it's measured by his word you're doing nothing you may say i've got all kinds of people following it look at the crowds look at the numbers but you're doing nothing amen based on what the word based on what he sees amen it isn't based on your judgment isn't based why you can stir all kinds of people through all kinds of ways have an emotional up why they can just gather around emotionally but you've done nothing outside of the word of god you've done nothing outside of god portraying himself through you by revelation and you and taking you aside and killing you first and then filling you you're doing nothing it's a killing first in fact every day it's a killing to see god manifest jesus himself said you must deny yourself take up your cross and follow me who is he the word for the hour the word of a prophet the word of this bible you never can prove anything the prophet brought us that contrary this bible in fact if the prophet didn't bring it you wouldn't know what was in this bible for this day because god has a channel to bring his word through and that he would do through a prophet it's not following a man it's following god's ordained way see god can do anything he wants that's right but when he sets a pattern he doesn't move from it when he sets a a pro when he has when he sets a preeminence he doesn't move from it and in the beginning he showed us that revelation made the difference between cain and abel revelation was the difference and revelation is what he accepted then how we gonna get in the other way amen that's right it's exactly right amen so the important thing now watch but when we get to the place we know we're nothing we get to the place when we know we're nothing then god can use us the important thing here's an important thing he said one of the most important things we must master he said now remember this and especially you young preachers and lay members alike and that included me because i was once a young preacher also and i read that same quote for years but i love this message don't you i just love it because why it just keeps opening what is it the opening of the sun where is it rising in me in you brother branham said it is the rising of the sun in fact he turned right around and said and the sun is up think of that then where do we see it rising amen amen amen it's called an invisible union all right that's not i'll just pull off of that but by that union the bride is positionally placed okay the important thing you young preachers and lay members alike there's one thing you've got to master if you expect to fulfill god's desire in your life that is we have to master the thought of human ability amen amen amen god help us all to master that thought of human ability amen oh my all right if we ever get to a spot where we think we can do it with our own intelligence and our own ability something you've learned we've got to master that in such a way that we can get rid of that thing and lay it aside so that god can use us that's right amen amen and conjunction and tying these two together and make a complete surrender cannot use one ability we've got to make a complete surrender and come to god you've got to surrender to him both soul body spirit everything that you are has to be surrendered to god in order that he can work his will in you and me brother david you're making emphasis absolutely that's the key amen and then if i must press and i will press and i will press in that right there to the high calling to the prize of it amen i want to see that measure of what god called me to do fulfilled in my life by his power i have no other desire amen that's right that is the absolute desire let me completely absolutely yield and surrender and submit everything and then rest in it because i know you're in me and you've accepted the obligation i'm giving you full headship and responsibility and then don't fret over it when it doesn't go the way you think it should that's right and quit your murmuring about it because if you know god's in you he's got to lead you if you give yourself to him he'll take it then he's going to do things that's going to absolutely be radical to your own thinking man's thinking david's thinking he's going to do things that's absolutely going to be opposite way you think and reason it should be but when you're certain of god he's going to guide you and lead you and it'll come out just right now we can come into that thought of of that thought of uh considering your ways because in haggai he said consider your ways you're going out here making a living and putting it in bags with holes you're doing this you're sowing and reaping little and all these things and the reason why because you've got your focus wrong you should be focusing on building the body the temple the house and the and the word of god for the hour and take your focus on that instead if you put it back in your sealed houses and your businesses and everything else comes into place instead of the word the word takes second place and it should be first hebrews matthew 6 33 said seek ye first not last give god the first of your day give god the best of your day give god the everything first prayer first amen get up a little earlier if you can't do it at night do it in the morning giving the first part of your day oh i said but i gotta have my beauty rest no you just think you do give him an hour give him a half hour give it to him and you'll find out your day will go different than it did yesterday give him that first place i don't care how pressed you are to get something done i learned that a long time ago when i felt so pressed i got to do this and if i give god that time i'll never get it done well i didn't get it done but when i gave god the time and giving the place and the first place in my life everything got done in his order in time and i wrote more business i did everything better that's when i was the insurance business what about when you're a pastor same thing take time you say i don't have time take it redeem it and quit your fearing about the other because when you seek first the kingdom of god and his righteousness which is his will which is his word amen then what's going to happen all these other things are going to be added to you get our focus right and the and the holes will start closing up putting first in your finances put him first in the tithing putting first in everything you do everything let god be first let his word be first let his will be first and i guarantee you that everything else will fall in its place and you will be provided everything will be right not whether you think it is but his word his word will be right his ways are right his ways are perfect all that god does is perfect and he said he made your way perfect that's what he said god's ways are perfect and you being in him have to be perfect he said he made your way perfect and perfect included scars misunderstandings persecution what are you doing perfecting the flesh or perfecting the inner man who's growing up here who's taking the body change who's who's going to come who's going to come to the point where he's going to come out of this whole body what's going to produce it amen all right now i'll hurry i still have a little bit of time okay and make a complete surrender now i know it's hard brother bram said i know it's hard why because it goes contrary to your human nature it goes contrary to the way even to you know genetically well my mother did this and i'm strong in that i just forget that die to it if it's not the will of god die to it if it's contrary to the word and keep it under obedience you know satan got a punch coming at you you know that what would you rather that punch me nervousness or arthritic or something said he said satan got a place to punch at you a weak place i think i just lost the knife got a weak place but he said that's the place you have to keep covered amen you and i both have that i know where that is hello are you there i'm there all right i know we're always wanting to put a part in something that you know that we know that we want to do it we'll say well i just i just know it should be done this way kind of hits the core doesn't it of all of us some of us to a greater degree than others and i just know it has to be this way because i'm first born i speak for my wife too because she's first born and we have a happy time together 50 years of happy time by the grace of god it sharpened us stone sharpeneth what's hot that steals iron sharpened with iron i'm glad she lost her iron disposition and i'm losing mine thank god i can look both of us and say we've lost it by the grace of god amen amen but you know moses had to be tempered by a wife too brother brown said she was hot tempered and he learned some weakness god knows how to give it to you to bring out his character to get you the point where someday you'll look back and say thank you lord for every one of those times how many times through the years we prayed this and this i don't know why this happy lord i don't know why it's happening i just don't all of a sudden he shows you that was me all the time molding you shaping you bringing out what i wanted to bring out i had you go through this in your church i had you to leave i had to do this i had to scar you and scar you and scar you and scar you by think people said they didn't say shoulda said everything else you haven't been in the pastor too long and not know that scarred why but it's god molding you bringing you to the position and place where you need to be so quit making excuses for your scars that's right look upon them differently quit hating them look and say god you had control over every bit of it look where i am today i didn't leave your word by your power i didn't leave it it didn't put me under it just let me dig a little further it just kept bringing out the character was inside of me you wanted to mold me in that's right and he's still working on me he's not perfecting this he's perfecting that inside that perfects this will change it all right let me go this little flower further here now that's hard i know we're wanting to put our part in something we know something we want to do god cannot use your ability but as long as you're doing it the way it that doing it that way is going to be wrong i just know i know that has to be done this way but it'll be wrong god will never use that effort maybe with the help of the lord we're going to get into that in a few minutes and just show you god cannot use your ability amen that's what's the matter with the world today there's too much seminary experiences in the message i put that in there that was injected for emphasis all right too much placed upon education too much placed upon relationships or fellowships in denomination a system an order of doing something all right he said and making it a group affair instead of an individual affair we rest on one another we rest upon men with ability the bible said how can you have faith when you're preferring one another well this guy's a great person look what he's done why he's been with the prophet talked with the prophet hung with the prophet why he ought to know what he's doing and he built a church and this and that and something else and he's passing money out everywhere building land and properties and not giving them the message what's wrong is he lacks revelation and they put their confidence in men and lets the man fail and still the people don't get it that's right all right now well we'll just lean we'll displease with you must lean upon god and god alone we mustn't trust the ability of ourselves we must not trust the ability of ourselves or any man we must completely yield to god no ability i don't care whose it is will never be usable in the sight of god god has to get all our abilities out of us before he can achieve his purpose if he's got something for us to do as long as we feel that we're doing a pretty good job of it then we'll never be able to be used of god we tried to do it in human ability if every person that professes to be a christian will forget his own ability and yield himself to god then god can achieve his purpose by sending not a revival but brother what he needs to first send is a killing that's right so we can revive you have to die before you can be born again you have to he needs a killing it need he we need a killing of ourselves the tabernacle needs a killing brother abraham says and me with it all of us we need a killing so that we can revive be revived in a new life a new hold a new hope a new experience we must get away from that human ability we've got to get to a place where we can surrender our souls and lives even to the housewife to the farmer to the mechanic or whoever we are we've got to surrender completely to god and know that we are nothing then let god start from there then he starts moving working that includes all of us everyone that's the thing we've got to do some of us build upon intellectual conception well that man's a scholar and he wrote a book and some of us and he's a he's an excellent speaker and he's got the way to bring peace and harmony and nonsense there's only one place of peace and harmony the next one based on some sensation of movement shaking crying shouting dancing in the spirit or something some emotional outward work and that's just as bad as the education if the devil can't get you on one side he'll push you off the other side but the thing of it is is having nothing you can depend on in your own self or anything you can do just a complete total surrender of your weakness unto god and say here i am have nothing no ability that you can trust in god can use them if they're ready to forget that they are a somebody you've got to forget you're a somebody and become a nobody god can use you and make us somebody out of you but you've got to forget that you are so important there's many of us now look he said the more you get out of yourself the more room you can got for the holy spirit to come in paul said first corinthians 2 1 i am determined not to know anything among you save jesus christ and him crucified i didn't come to you with excellency of speech i didn't come to you through my learning i come to you as a weakling he said i come to you in fear and trembling he said trembling that i come to you in weakness and trembling because he said i cannot trust in my own ability if he couldn't trust in his learned ability then since when are we going to trust in any other man's ability or our own ability to think it through and to learn and then to pass that garbage onto other people in this message when we ought to be living a manifestation of the promised word but the problem is is you need the holy ghost to do it and because you shouted because you prophesied because you do this and that and something else you think you got it when your life won't match the word how you say it will match your word because your fruit is not the word for the season amen that's where the blood lays i said a mouthful right then god give us understanding i don't know i'm determined not to know anything about your abilities paul said i know there's nothing in you and i'm only determined to know one thing that i see in you i want to see jesus christ and him crucified boy all but it's hard when he crucifies or when we're crucified is that right but that's what he said i want to see i've got to see jesus christ in you and him crucified all right the crucified saver among you that's all i'm going to recognize because he could not trust in his own ability i hope that gets down deep to us both here in the tape world too that you realize that you've got to become nothing not a know-it-all not a great somebody but a nobody you've got to come to dust you've got to get to the place that you know that you're nothing you don't and don't ever raise above it for as soon as you raise above it you rise above god you've got to keep yourself in the dust and on the road to damascus you've got to keep yourself off your high horse and that's for everywhere here and in the tape world and it's not a make-believe it is a real belief revelation is not a make-believe revelation is a true substance of the word in you revealed all right then paul said when i'm weak then i'm strong then i will glory my infirmities of my weakness and so forth i thank you god that i got it all out of me and when i get everything out of me then god can come in but as long as i got some of myself there god can't get in we smother him out we drive him away from the poorest of us to the richest of us from the lost the least to the greatest we keep god out of our lives because of our own selves that's the greatest enemy of god's william branham he's the one that gets in god's way he's the one that gets lazy he's the one that gets to a place where he thinks he can do something about it when he does that shoves god right out of the picture let me tell you something we appreciate good works but good works won't bring in the rapture but works reflecting faith the faith of god the faith of god will put you in the rapture amen are you with me it's revelation that makes a difference amen and if there's true revelation there your works will show that revelation and men will see those works and glorify your father which is in heaven because they see the works of the holy ghost and you manifest it through faith amen that's it all right when i can get this guy out of the way william brown and when i can get a place where he's out of the way then god can come over and do things that william branham's nothing about so when that's when god can use you that's when he can use any of you he can use anybody when we get out of the way but as long as we got ourselves in the way we cannot all right oh my god soldiers our heroes we just read in the book of the 11th chapter 34th verse out of weakness was made strong they had to get weak before they could get strong out of their weakness they were made strong can you give me five minutes i've got something i gotta finish with i'd like to go more on that on that of consider your ways but we can do that another time i think i touched on it you made that we made that no you believe god's sovereign how many has ever heard this writing called the high calling yes okay it's called the high quality may not be what you have in the office no no it may be and it may not be i want to read it can i read it okay a little bit of reading here again just listen to me because i want to i didn't know whether to start this or close this but god definitely had had laid this in my heart i got to read this i pray god will help us bring out in it for you individually what you need how this come about this message was found written on a piece of paper amongst the artifact they use the word artifacts of brother branham or his personal possession it is understood that he carried it with him as a reminder of his high calling okay so you're aware of that okay it was actually given to ernie fandler i guess and then ernie was given to him by another brother too ernie brother branham gave it to ernie fandler through another richard i think it's a richard gough anyway you're aware of it you mind if i read it just let me read this if god has called you to be really like jesus which the bride is called to be really like jesus because she is she is jesus in another form i hope i didn't choke anybody by that statement all right if if god has called you to be really like jesus in all your spirit little s spirit he will draw you into a life of crucifixion and humility and put on you such demands of obedience that he will not allow you to follow other christians and in many ways he will he will seem to let other good people do things which he will not let you do is that the same thing okay other christians and ministers who seem very religious and useful may push themselves pull wires work schemes to carry out their plans but you cannot do it and if you attempt if you attempt it you will meet with such failure and rebuke from the lord as to make you solely sorely penitent others can brag on themselves on their work on their success on their writings but the holy spirit will not allow you to do any such thing if you begin it he will lead you into some deep mortification that will make you despise yourself and all your good works okay others will be allowed to succeed in making great sums of money or having a legacy left to them or having luxuries but god may supply you daily but god may supply you daily daily just daily not just giving you everything but daily getting you to trust him daily because he wants you to have something far better than gold that is a helpless dependence upon him that he may have the privilege of providing your needs day by day out of the unseen treasury the lord may let others be honored and put forward and keep you hid away in obscurity because he wants to produce some choice fragrant fruit for his coming glory which can only be produced in the shade in obscurity god will let others be great but keep you small he will let us do work for him and keep his keep the cred and and get the credits for it but he will make you work and toil on without knowing how much you are doing and then make your work still more and then to make your work still more precious he will let others get the credit for the for the work which you have done and this will make your reward ten times greater when jesus comes the holy spirit will put a strict watch in you with jealous love and will rebuke you for little words or feelings or for wasting your time which other christians never seem distressed over so make up your mind that god is infinite is an infinite sovereign he has a right to do as he pleases with his own and he will not explain to you he will not explain to you a thousand things which may puzzle your reason in this dealings with you that's where you have to know that's where you have confidence to completely give it over to you have to know him and he's in you then you rest i don't care how the way goes it's going to work according to his dealing and if it's something wrong little any little thing wrong prophet said he'll show you you'll correct it see the confidence we have in him all right put him first god will take you god will take you at your word and if you absolutely see yourself to be his slave he will wrap you up in a jealous love and let other people say and do many things that you cannot say cannot do or say settle it forever that you are to deal directly with the holy spirit that is to have the privilege of tying your tongue or chaining your hand or closing your eyes now that's not now let's let the lord take care of that all right in ways that others may are not to deal with now when you are so possessed with the living god that you are in your secret heart please and delighted over this particular personal private jealous guardianship and management of the holy spirit over your life you will have found the vestibule of heaven now listen brother sister god will deal directly with you with the holy spirit but there's one thing the holy spirit will not do is lead you away from his word see satan can use that he says see the holy spirit's on you but what are you doing you're leaving the word the holy spirit's not doing that just let that soak in the holy spirit will not lead you off his word he said i'm led by the holy spirit i can go against my husband not according the word you can't unless he says something or does something contrary to the word or makes you do something contrary the word then you stay with the word is that okay brother paul that's the truth okay god bless you i'm done let's stand i took a little more time sorry brother chris it's up to you next time or brother paul you're the one no i believe in being led as the holy spirit wants us to be led amen you you know and it a right motive and objective too in which we do all right all right let's bow our heads heavenly father as we bring this little meeting to a close different lord but we know i believe with all my heart you spoke and i accept it lord i needed these things also i need them every day let us remember lord just keep
