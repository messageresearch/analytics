[25:20] in the heart this feels
[25:23] [Music]
[25:40] much when God is in it
[25:44] labor not for wealth or fame there's a
[25:50] ground and you can win it if you go in
[25:57] Jesus name
[25:58] does the place your call to labor seem
[26:04] so small and middle Moon
[26:09] it is great if God is in it and he'll
[26:15] not forget his own
[26:18] little
[26:20] much when God is in it
[26:23] labor not for wealth or fame for there's
[26:29] a crown and you can win it if you go in

[28:30] got off the plane I thought man
[28:33] Idaho is home
[28:36] I'm from Alaska
[28:38] Idaho's home
[28:40] hey man now we had a good trip
[28:42] um
[28:43] thank you musicians
[28:45] had a good trip and uh just bring
[28:47] greetings back from
[28:49] Church there in Anchorage and
[28:52] on our most Tabernacle out there in
[28:53] chivac
[28:55] um God seemed to to deal with
[28:56] everybody's heart
[28:58] last week and um
[29:03] you know we we fought some some Spirits
[29:06] the first couple of nights but
[29:09] really went to prayer and God broke
[29:11] through on the third night so
[29:13] I know that God never lets his word
[29:16] return to him void
[29:18] and the devil will try to tell you and
[29:21] convince you that
[29:23] somewhere you've gone off but
[29:26] we don't put our faith in our feelings
[29:29] we put our faith in what God has given
[29:31] us in his word
[29:32] and showed us showed us to do
[29:35] you know that
[29:37] think of that story
[29:39] of a deacon man in uh Siberia there was
[29:44] a during the Communist Regime in Russia
[29:47] there was this pastor who got arrested
[29:51] and sent off to prison they took his
[29:52] family and sent them to the middle of
[29:54] nowhere Siberia to basically die
[29:58] and um they had eaten their last meal
[30:02] and went to bed the mom and the kids
[30:04] went to bed and it was a blizzard out
[30:07] and pretty much without intervention
[30:11] they're going to wake up
[30:13] either they're gonna wake up or they're
[30:14] not gonna wake up it was a life for
[30:16] death and
[30:17] 30 something 60 miles away and then no
[30:19] cars blizzard
[30:21] um
[30:22] God spoke to the heart of this Deacon
[30:24] and told them middle of the night get up
[30:27] hook your horse to your sled load it
[30:30] full of food and go to this house
[30:32] and he's like that's crazy if I do that
[30:34] I'm gonna die and and uh you know the
[30:37] Wolves will attack me and eat my horse
[30:39] and eat me and and everything and it's a
[30:42] blizzard out and everything and God
[30:43] spoke to his heart again
[30:45] and he said it didn't say you had to
[30:46] come back
[30:47] I just said you had to go
[30:50] and sometimes and he went
[30:52] and he came back and he he came back
[30:55] alive he came back fine but what uh I
[30:58] read that I thought what an invaluable
[30:59] lesson as believers
[31:01] we don't always
[31:03] know
[31:05] the
[31:07] rest of the story
[31:09] we don't know the the the the next five
[31:13] steps but we know
[31:15] the next step we know who holds the next
[31:18] few moments of our life and and
[31:21] getting to that place where we just
[31:24] rest in
[31:26] the hands of God
[31:28] I mean what what a what a powerful place
[31:31] it would be to to go through life and
[31:34] not fear
[31:36] I think I think we have to have a good
[31:39] perfect body but
[31:40] there's been individuals through history
[31:42] who have who have who have testified of
[31:45] living in a place
[31:47] so close to God that it's faith and
[31:50] nothing else
[31:52] fear is just darkness fear is not its
[31:55] substance
[31:56] faith is a substance and faith is light
[32:00] and we can take a hold of that take a
[32:03] hold of the word of God says it starts
[32:06] in the mind
[32:07] that's where it starts but it moves down
[32:10] when you accept it it moves down into
[32:12] your heart now it's now it's doing the
[32:14] changing in your life
[32:16] but getting to that place it takes
[32:18] absolute faith
[32:20] absolute faith in the word that God has
[32:22] given you to accept that
[32:25] for it to move from a thought from an
[32:28] intellectual idea down into something
[32:30] inside your heart
[32:32] amen so
[32:34] next time you don't know how you're
[32:35] going to get back
[32:37] remember he just said go
[32:39] hey man you want to stand up tonight
[32:41] with me
[32:45] and turn into your Bibles to Galatians
[32:47] chapter one
[33:05] Galatians chapter one
[33:07] verse 1.
[33:10] Paul an apostle not of men neither by
[33:12] man but by Jesus Christ and God the
[33:15] Father who raised him from the dead and
[33:17] all the Brethren which are with me unto
[33:20] the churches of galatia Grace be to you
[33:23] and peace from the god
[33:25] from God the father and from our Lord
[33:27] Jesus Christ who gave himself for our
[33:29] sins that he might Deliver Us from this
[33:32] present evil world according to the will
[33:34] of God and our father to whom be glory
[33:38] forever and ever amen
[33:40] I Marvel that you are so soon removed
[33:43] from him that called you into the grace
[33:45] of Christ unto another gospel which is
[33:49] not another but there be some that
[33:51] trouble you and would pervert the gospel
[33:54] of Christ
[33:56] but though we or an angel from heaven
[33:58] preach any other gospel unto you than
[34:00] that which we have preached unto you
[34:03] let him be accursed as we said before so
[34:07] say I now again if any man preach any
[34:09] other gospel unto you then that you have
[34:11] received let him be accursed
[34:15] for do I now persuade men or God or do I
[34:18] seek to please men for if I yet pleased
[34:21] men I should not be the servant of
[34:24] Christ
[34:25] it's powerheads Heavenly Father Lord
[34:28] Jesus we pray that you would come and
[34:30] speak to our hearts tonight Lord
[34:33] we we want to hear from you Lord we
[34:35] don't want to hear
[34:36] my thoughts we don't want to hear my
[34:38] opinions Laurie we pray that you would
[34:41] just
[34:41] settle your atmosphere down here Lord
[34:44] Jesus in this place Lord you've given us
[34:46] a promise in your word that you would be
[34:48] we're two or three are gathered in your
[34:50] name or asking you to come down tonight
[34:52] Lord Jesus and just settle in and speak
[34:55] to us we ask Lord let me pull up our
[34:58] feet under the table of the of of the of
[35:00] the kingdom of God and the bread of life
[35:03] would be served tonight Lord that we
[35:05] would partake of your word that you
[35:07] could speak to us we ask in Jesus
[35:09] Christ's name we pray amen you can be
[35:12] seated tonight
[35:20] this scripture here Paul's speaking and
[35:23] he he's speaking to the Galatians
[35:27] and he's marveling because
[35:29] he says you I I'm amazed that you are so
[35:34] soon
[35:34] removed from him that called you into
[35:37] the grace of Christ
[35:39] so something happened something happened
[35:41] with the Galatians something came along
[35:42] and and you know
[35:46] something moved them you see there the
[35:50] the value that we hold in our position
[35:53] in Christ
[35:55] or the position that we hold in Christ
[35:57] is invaluable
[36:00] and sometimes the Devil Hill he'll come
[36:02] along well he was always coming along
[36:04] everywhere you go he's coming along he's
[36:06] tagging along
[36:08] and
[36:10] he'll use things he'll use things in
[36:12] your life to to
[36:15] lay a hook in your flesh
[36:18] and
[36:20] it's our jobs when we we see the hook to
[36:23] to pluck it off I know that's an
[36:26] interesting example but so it comes to
[36:28] my mind the devil throws his his hook
[36:31] and he tries to to hook something so
[36:33] anything can happen I mean we we are
[36:36] we're humans
[36:37] and
[36:39] anything can happen somebody can say
[36:41] something or somebody cannot say
[36:42] something or we just get burdened down
[36:47] with life
[36:49] and
[36:51] every day we have to get up and we have
[36:53] to pretty much do the same thing we did
[36:55] yesterday
[36:57] and
[36:59] you know
[37:01] if we're not careful we we forget
[37:05] we forget
[37:06] what started us off in the first place
[37:09] maybe maybe you forgot why you took that
[37:12] job in the first place
[37:14] maybe you forgot why you you were led to
[37:17] this church
[37:18] in the first place
[37:20] because
[37:22] the devil loves the number one thing
[37:24] that the world deals with today is
[37:27] depression
[37:28] that's a big deal
[37:30] and
[37:32] I'm in traveling around in different
[37:35] places the last just the last little bit
[37:38] I've come into contact with that spirit
[37:42] in in ministering
[37:44] and at first I didn't I didn't know what
[37:45] it was I I couldn't figure out what was
[37:48] going on I just felt just got out the
[37:50] pulpit to preach and I started falling
[37:53] asleep
[37:54] just and it was and this is just a weird
[37:57] way of putting it but I was I couldn't I
[38:00] couldn't hold a train a thought I
[38:02] couldn't I couldn't keep continuity with
[38:06] what I was saying and I was just praying
[38:09] like Lord what's what's going on and
[38:12] sometime later I I found out that there
[38:14] were some individuals battling suicide
[38:17] in the in the building
[38:19] and I and I hit that again in another
[38:21] place for a couple of different services
[38:25] and
[38:26] because what happens is is
[38:29] we can't we can't explain the gospel to
[38:33] you we can't explain the message to you
[38:36] I can't I can't take a quote and and and
[38:39] dissect it and pull sentence here in a
[38:42] sentence here and make it and and
[38:43] explain it to you I can't I can't read
[38:47] you a scripture and try to explain it to
[38:49] you and and when you serve God
[38:53] and you look for an explanation
[38:57] you will find
[38:59] many times you will find discouragement
[39:02] you're not looking for Revelation you're
[39:04] not looking for Christ you're looking
[39:07] for an explanation you're looking for
[39:09] the answer to the question why
[39:12] and when you when you start getting into
[39:15] this position where in your mind you're
[39:18] looking at a situation you're looking at
[39:20] your church you're looking at what's
[39:22] going on around you and you start saying
[39:24] why is this person doing this why is
[39:26] this person not doing this why am I
[39:28] doing this
[39:30] if you focus on that and you look for an
[39:34] explanation instead of strength instead
[39:36] of Revelation instead of the leading of
[39:38] the Holy Spirit you come from it from a
[39:41] man's point of view and you look for an
[39:44] explanation
[39:45] you will find discouragement because
[39:49] what you're doing is you're you're
[39:51] looking outside of Christ you're looking
[39:54] for a way to to make sense it's like
[39:57] people try to make sense of the world
[39:58] look the world doesn't make sense
[40:02] we're not we're not here to figure out
[40:03] why the world is the way it is when I
[40:05] figure out why the the the politics are
[40:08] the way they are why all this stuff is
[40:10] happening if you try to figure out why
[40:12] or how Biden got elected or or anything
[40:15] on the extreme side of things or figure
[40:18] out why you know is it that that I I
[40:21] want to get a job and I have to have a
[40:23] vaccine or why why all this stuff you
[40:26] will find yourself it discouraged
[40:28] because your focus is removed from the
[40:33] word of God
[40:35] but when your focus is on is on the word
[40:38] and you're saying and you say and
[40:39] instead of looking at something and
[40:41] saying okay well maybe this is the
[40:43] reason why or maybe this is the reason
[40:45] why or this or that and instead you say
[40:48] you ask God to show you what he's doing
[40:53] you find strength the scripture says
[40:56] they that wait upon the Lord shall renew
[40:58] their strength
[41:00] and when we push ahead and we push ahead
[41:03] on our own abilities our own thoughts
[41:05] our own opinions our own explanations of
[41:08] things you know the word says casting
[41:12] down vain imaginations
[41:14] you want to there's many things that can
[41:15] be evade imaginations but you know one
[41:17] vain imagination having an argument with
[41:19] somebody in your head
[41:22] because you are putting words in their
[41:24] mouth
[41:26] or having a discussion with somebody in
[41:28] your head and you walk away
[41:29] self-satisfied that you convince them
[41:31] and you've never said a word to them
[41:33] you've convinced yourself
[41:36] that this is how they think this is how
[41:38] they view the the situation I mean
[41:41] marriage it happens all the time right
[41:45] you have two imperfect people coming
[41:46] together to become one
[41:51] because it only happens
[41:54] with the word as our guide so when our
[41:58] when our Focus so what happened in
[42:00] galatia
[42:02] is they got caught up
[42:04] in in everything else
[42:06] there I mean you you talk about drama
[42:09] there was drama at this point in history
[42:12] you had the Jews saying you got to be
[42:14] circumcised the Gentiles saying you
[42:17] don't and then the Gentiles bringing in
[42:18] their traditions and their culture
[42:20] clashing it with the Jews culture he had
[42:23] the Jews holding onto their culture
[42:25] Gentiles holding on to their culture
[42:27] churches starting up Paul would be there
[42:29] for a Time start the church get somebody
[42:31] in place he'd go off to the next place
[42:33] and that church would then I mean just
[42:36] a lot of things were going on but if
[42:39] you've taken you and you go look through
[42:41] the scriptures and you look through uh
[42:43] the book of kings and you look at at the
[42:46] camp of Israel
[42:48] Israel is a type of the church
[42:51] so the kings are pastors
[42:55] Ministries whatever
[42:58] look at the mess
[43:00] the mess that the Israel was in now you
[43:03] can say oh yes well you know they were
[43:05] they didn't have the Holy Ghost they
[43:07] have conversion and everything
[43:09] um
[43:10] the same message are happening all
[43:13] around us
[43:14] and our churches we got people sleeping
[43:16] with people we got problems that and
[43:18] it's all under the umbrella of the
[43:20] message church so
[43:23] if we're not careful we focus on that
[43:27] or even in our own church you know we
[43:28] see hey that person's not doing like
[43:30] they should be doing you focus on them
[43:33] and you try to say look they got a
[43:36] problem and all this stuff instead of
[43:37] praying for them instead of instead of
[43:40] asking the Lord to lead you in
[43:42] conversation with them
[43:44] you get discouraged you get depressed
[43:49] and
[43:50] we are called to have Liberty
[43:53] Freedom the the we're supposed to preach
[43:56] what this in spirit and in truth
[43:59] preaching the word of God sharing the
[44:02] word of God
[44:03] fellowshipping it should be Liberty and
[44:06] freedom who cares how many people come
[44:08] to church on Wednesday night you came
[44:12] God only needs one person
[44:16] the preacher no
[44:22] no he doesn't need a whole crowd and but
[44:26] where we see people go off the rails is
[44:29] they start to focus on that kind of
[44:31] stuff
[44:32] it's able to pews they're still lime
[44:34] green
[44:37] their views and they're comfortable so
[44:40] don't fall asleep
[44:43] who cares
[44:45] you get focused on they'll say well you
[44:47] know I wish he you know
[44:49] the pastor would do this and he doesn't
[44:51] do this and why doesn't he do this and I
[44:53] wish he
[44:55] either pray through or find a different
[44:57] Church
[44:59] you see people get focused it gets all
[45:02] politics like I I was just traveling in
[45:05] a section of the world
[45:06] I won't say where you talk about the
[45:08] politics for years embedded you can feel
[45:12] it when you preach to them
[45:14] it's embedded in their conscience and
[45:16] how they view things and and that's you
[45:18] know what that is that's a religious
[45:20] spirit yeah
[45:22] because Church became a religious Act
[45:27] not a relationship you see we're not
[45:30] called to take up a church doctrine
[45:31] we're not called up to take the message
[45:34] culture we're called to take the
[45:36] doctrine of Christ
[45:38] and the culture of Christ
[45:41] the culture of Christ loves a brother
[45:44] whether they agree or not
[45:47] loves
[45:49] now I didn't say gives their money to I
[45:52] didn't say goes to their church I said
[45:54] love them
[45:56] you can like our Pastor said before just
[45:59] stuck with me he could vehemently
[46:01] disagree with somebody and still love
[46:03] them
[46:04] if you go turn with me to First
[46:06] Corinthians chapter 13.
[46:16] they uh
[46:18] I kind of had this focus on faith lately
[46:21] and I was in in brother uh I think
[46:24] brother Sam's house the Samus is the
[46:26] Ruth I was in the restroom and they had
[46:28] this thing on the wall
[46:29] and it was that scripture in Corinthians
[46:32] about Above All Else
[46:38] um
[46:40] says and now First Corinthians 13 verse
[46:43] 13.
[46:45] and now abideth faith hope charity these
[46:50] three but the greatest of these
[46:53] is love
[46:56] and I and I I read that and it just it
[46:59] hit me because I've been studying faith
[47:01] and you look at Faith is a revelation
[47:04] and it takes Revelation to see God
[47:07] it takes Revelation to know Christ in
[47:10] your day to know the present God I am it
[47:13] takes Faith revelation
[47:16] yet greater than that
[47:19] is love
[47:20] and I thought Lord I don't know I I
[47:23] still don't claim to have it figured out
[47:27] how that works
[47:29] because brother bear says the greatest
[47:30] force in the world is love
[47:34] and maybe I'm misquoting that so you go
[47:36] double check that but
[47:40] it's not love as in as in
[47:44] filio like
[47:46] common person to person or you you love
[47:49] your dog or you you love your cat or you
[47:51] you know you love tacos
[47:54] it's it's a love that that
[47:59] you have to have
[48:02] in order to you have faith and you have
[48:04] hope
[48:05] and and these three of these three abide
[48:09] together
[48:10] but the greatest of these is love
[48:14] Christ is the perfect representation of
[48:18] love
[48:21] so for us to get Christ and here's how
[48:24] it works for us to get Christ we have to
[48:27] have faith and revelation
[48:30] and then we get Christ
[48:32] now once we have Christ and we cultivate
[48:37] that relationship
[48:40] from within us comes this called
[48:42] brotherly love
[48:44] it's a love that you have for the for
[48:46] the children of God brother says the
[48:48] mature bride when see they see somebody
[48:50] not doing well or or or or they disagree
[48:53] with that's not you know living out
[48:56] to the scriptures that the bride a
[49:00] mature bride will love them and pray for
[49:02] them
[49:03] right you see you can you can have a
[49:05] there's people who don't leave don't
[49:08] believe the message anymore who have a
[49:11] revelation of serpent seed
[49:14] but they missed Christ
[49:18] because
[49:19] vultures food
[49:21] do you know what vultures food is
[49:23] Eagle food gone bad
[49:27] that fish that was fresh one time and
[49:30] the eagle was eating it and then he
[49:32] moved on to new fish
[49:34] and that fish rotted and now the
[49:36] vultures eating it you see we can't you
[49:38] know we say well we can't preach Noah's
[49:39] message today and we laugh because
[49:42] that's so obvious
[49:43] but you can't live on your faith
[49:47] from last
[49:49] you need
[49:51] food today I can't live on that steak I
[49:54] ate Friday night
[49:57] I gotta have food Saturday Sunday Monday
[50:00] Tuesday today
[50:04] what happens is you get you get focused
[50:07] and you forget the point
[50:09] the point is Christ the point is isn't
[50:12] how well you can know the scriptures
[50:15] how you well you can know the message or
[50:18] how well you know conduct order and
[50:20] Doctrine
[50:21] and how a church should be run if you if
[50:25] you if you focus on that aspect of of
[50:29] things you you disconnect okay it's like
[50:35] it's hard to I'll say this just very
[50:38] tongue-in-cheek okay it's hard to
[50:40] forgive somebody you don't know they're
[50:42] strangers whatever get on you know
[50:43] you'll never see them again that jerk
[50:45] and you belong with your life but if
[50:47] that's somebody you love that you have
[50:49] to see all of the time
[50:51] you want to fix that
[50:53] you want to make that right because you
[50:55] love them
[50:56] see that said tongue-in-cheek terrible
[50:58] example because the point across someone
[51:00] you have invested a relationship with
[51:02] when something goes awry you're quick
[51:05] there to fix it you're quick to to patch
[51:08] it up and to make it right
[51:12] but if you if it's all become laws and
[51:16] rules
[51:17] you disconnect brother man lost the
[51:20] feeling of the people remember because
[51:22] he got discouraged
[51:24] he he was preaching against the sin and
[51:26] he was preaching against all this and
[51:27] maybe I have the story a little bit off
[51:29] but it brings the same point and he lost
[51:32] his connection with the people he lost
[51:34] his love for the people he didn't lose
[51:36] his revelation
[51:38] he didn't lose his faith he lost his
[51:42] love
[51:43] and he had to go take a break
[51:45] and then God came and showed him and
[51:47] everything and so on and go read the
[51:49] story so you don't take my facts for my
[51:51] opinion my words for facts because I
[51:54] don't have it right here and I haven't
[51:54] read it in a minute
[51:56] but he lost the love of the people
[51:58] When you pray for somebody the best
[52:01] thing you can do is get yourself in
[52:04] their shoes
[52:06] because you feel for them and when you
[52:07] pray for somebody who who's gone going
[52:10] through something that you've gone
[52:11] through there's a there's a there's a
[52:13] touch point there that you can't get any
[52:15] other way
[52:17] you know having been healed of food
[52:19] allergies when somebody has that prayer
[52:21] has that desire I I can connect with
[52:24] them there's a love for for them I want
[52:27] to see them receive the same thing just
[52:29] like when you receive Christ and you see
[52:30] people who don't have Christ if you have
[52:33] been serving God and it usually we say
[52:35] over time because it doesn't happen
[52:37] right away over time and you start to
[52:39] apply it and it's just well I go to
[52:41] church Wednesday and I go to church
[52:43] Sunday and I read this book and I read
[52:45] this scriptures and I and I read these
[52:47] chapters and I go through this and and
[52:49] it's just a bunch of emotions and it's
[52:51] just a religious act you disconnect from
[52:55] the love
[52:56] and it is the love that holds the power
[53:00] you understand the scriptures
[53:02] but you stopped progressing because
[53:06] revelation
[53:08] is the most powerful is I'm
[53:10] contradicting myself I should have had
[53:12] this quote
[53:14] Revelation is more important to us than
[53:16] we realize that's what it was
[53:19] so we need Revelation but you need love
[53:21] too
[53:23] you gotta have all three
[53:26] love separated from that you'll find
[53:29] yourself you lose you lose relationship
[53:34] see Faith Revelation puts you in that
[53:37] position provokes you to that position
[53:39] where you have a relationship with
[53:41] Christ
[53:46] but you have to keep going on you can't
[53:49] stop you can't live on
[53:52] that of the past
[53:54] so Galatians they they they they found
[53:57] the disconnect and let's go back now and
[53:59] we're in First Corinthians 13 let's
[54:01] start with the verse first verse it says
[54:03] though I speak with the tongues of men
[54:05] and of angels and have not charity I am
[54:08] become as a sounding brass or a tinkling
[54:10] symbol
[54:11] see if I just would have read this we
[54:13] wouldn't have had all that confusion I
[54:16] am become as the sounding brass or a
[54:18] tinkling symbol and though I have the
[54:21] gift of Prophecy and understand all
[54:22] Mysteries and all knowledge and though I
[54:25] have all faith
[54:27] so that I could remove mountains and
[54:30] have not love I am nothing
[54:35] you see you see there's been people that
[54:38] I know who don't serve the Lord anymore
[54:41] who had faith and the miraculous in
[54:45] their life
[54:47] but they were missing a key in element
[54:49] verse 3 and though I bestow all my goods
[54:52] to feed the poor and though I give my
[54:54] body to be burned and have not charity
[54:56] it profiteth me nothing
[54:59] so you can have the faith to give your
[55:02] body
[55:05] give yourself over in death and and not
[55:08] have not charity and you're it's no good
[55:12] charity suffereth long and is kind
[55:15] envieth not charity vaunteth not itself
[55:18] is not puffed up
[55:20] does not behave itself unseemly seeketh
[55:23] not her own is not easily provoked
[55:25] thinketh no evil
[55:29] boy we we all we we're all just fell off
[55:32] there
[55:34] we just you know a couple of verses in
[55:36] on charity and we're all praying for
[55:38] grace Rejoice not rejoiceth not in
[55:41] iniquity but rejoiceth in the truth
[55:43] Bears all things believeth all things
[55:46] hope with all things endureth all things
[55:49] charity never faileth but whether there
[55:52] be prophecies they shall fail whether
[55:54] there be tongues they shall cease
[55:56] whether there be knowledge it shall
[55:58] vanish vanish away
[56:01] for we know see bear verse 7 beareth all
[56:04] things
[56:06] he
[56:07] you want to push back against against
[56:09] discouragement
[56:12] love
[56:14] but what is love what that's Christ
[56:16] right brotherly loves at the top of the
[56:18] pyramid
[56:19] it's Christ
[56:22] your relationship with Christ it dries
[56:25] up
[56:27] it's hard to Bear all things
[56:30] it's hard to endure all things
[56:35] it's hard to not get complacent it's
[56:37] hard to to not see the faults in
[56:39] everybody around you
[56:44] you meet people and and and and uh
[56:47] well I don't want to go that direction
[56:49] for he says for we know in part verse 9
[56:51] and we prophesy in part but when that
[56:53] which is perfect is come then that which
[56:55] is in part shall be done away when I was
[56:57] a child I spake as a child I understood
[56:59] as a child I thought as a child that
[57:01] when I became a man I put away childish
[57:04] things for now we see through a glass
[57:06] Darkly but then face to face now I know
[57:09] in part but then shall I know even as
[57:11] also I am known and now abided faith
[57:14] hope charity these three but the
[57:16] greatest of these is charity
[57:20] in the revelation of Jesus Christ a
[57:23] search age book
[57:25] he says he knows that if the people get
[57:27] the true revelation of the true church
[57:29] and what she is what she stands for and
[57:32] that she can do the Greater Works she
[57:34] will be an invincible Army
[57:36] if they get a true revelation of the two
[57:39] Spirits within the framework of the
[57:40] Christian church and by God's spirit
[57:42] discern and withstand the Antichrist
[57:45] spirit
[57:46] Satan will be powerless before her now
[57:53] it says she will be an invincible Army
[57:55] she gets a true revelation of the true
[57:57] church
[57:59] and if the church if the bride gets the
[58:02] true revelation of the two Spirits
[58:03] within the framework okay so the brag is
[58:07] revelation of the two spirits
[58:12] and by God's spirit discern now watch
[58:15] it's not just that you identify them
[58:17] it's that through the spirit of Christ
[58:20] which comes through a relationship you
[58:22] get power in your life through a
[58:25] relationship with Jesus Christ
[58:27] which is love Christ that's the Pinnacle
[58:31] and
[58:33] you have this connection with God now
[58:35] that I'm not saying love is the Holy
[58:36] Spirit
[58:38] somebody felt was thinking that but
[58:41] it's that you have a connection with god
[58:44] with Christ
[58:46] God's spirit so now through God's spirit
[58:48] you discern
[58:50] and withstand
[58:54] the Antichrist Spirit then Satan list is
[58:57] powerless before you so you can't just
[58:59] identify them you can't just discern
[59:02] them you have to also withstand them
[59:08] we will never have the power of Christ
[59:12] when we're Anointed with the power of
[59:15] religion
[59:20] it's not about
[59:23] it's just accepting it because we preach
[59:25] it here you gotta you got to know the
[59:27] word of God
[59:28] it's not about that that you come and
[59:31] you serve in the house of God you've got
[59:33] to have a relationship with God
[59:36] and if you serve if you serve apart from
[59:39] relationship you get bitter you get
[59:41] discouraged you get depressed
[59:44] boy I I don't even know who this is for
[59:46] this is just
[59:48] for me as a man a shot in the dark but I
[59:51] have to just trust the Lord
[59:53] you see so it's withstanding what is
[59:55] that what is that oh that's false
[59:57] Doctrine no no that's bitterness Pride
[1:00:01] arrogancy
[1:00:03] discontentment
[1:00:06] those are all anti-christ
[1:00:10] too often we read that and we think big
[1:00:12] and and the pope and you know the uh
[1:00:16] it's a but the Venom is God and all
[1:00:18] these things well yes that is Antichrist
[1:00:20] but so is a bad attitude
[1:00:23] that's the spirit of the devil
[1:00:26] right
[1:00:27] and we are called as the people of God
[1:00:30] to pursue perfection
[1:00:34] we're never going to be perfect in this
[1:00:35] body but don't use it as an excuse
[1:00:38] we are required to pursue perfection
[1:00:42] pursue and what is that that's a promise
[1:00:44] be a perfect even as I am perfect that's
[1:00:48] what those are Christ's words that's a
[1:00:51] promise and if we push towards that we
[1:00:55] take in faith gives us revelation of
[1:00:57] Christ Christ gives us the love that we
[1:00:59] need to endure all things to Bear all
[1:01:01] things to to Rejoice not an iniquity to
[1:01:04] rejoice in the truth to never fail
[1:01:08] to hope for all things to think no evil
[1:01:11] to not be easily provoked
[1:01:14] to not seek our own agenda or our own
[1:01:18] position to to not behave unseemly it
[1:01:21] gives us the ability to suffer long to
[1:01:24] be kind to not be envious of another
[1:01:27] brother's position in church or or
[1:01:29] envious of another brother's job or or
[1:01:31] another brother's stuff or another
[1:01:33] sister's skirt
[1:01:35] that we we that's what gives us that
[1:01:38] strength
[1:01:39] we walk this path and we get to that
[1:01:41] position now we can stand
[1:01:44] discern and withstand
[1:01:48] you can't Skip One you can't do it
[1:01:50] without you can't do it backwards you
[1:01:52] can't Skip One you gotta you gotta go
[1:01:54] the way God ordained it
[1:01:56] can't jump over the fence you got to
[1:01:57] come through the gate who who is the
[1:02:00] door to the gate well it's Christ
[1:02:02] how do you get to Christ well you gotta
[1:02:05] total surrender look total surrender
[1:02:07] comes from
[1:02:09] complete faith
[1:02:11] complete faith comes from total trust
[1:02:15] you gotta trust God all the way
[1:02:18] then you have faith
[1:02:20] see it's why God does stuff in your life
[1:02:21] to show you look you can trust me that's
[1:02:23] why he has testimonies in the word of
[1:02:25] God proves his word of God for that says
[1:02:28] God proves his word
[1:02:29] so he proves his words he shows you over
[1:02:32] and over and over again you can trust me
[1:02:34] you can trust me
[1:02:36] he comes in your life and he does things
[1:02:39] and he he changes you and he shows you
[1:02:41] how he changes you so you can trust him
[1:02:44] when you have trust you have faith in
[1:02:46] him and you begin to see God if God can
[1:02:49] keep his word here then what he's
[1:02:51] telling me is truth
[1:02:53] now Revelation begins to work in your
[1:02:56] life
[1:02:57] and with that comes a personal
[1:03:00] relationship as you receive Christ for
[1:03:04] yourself
[1:03:06] you meet somebody who's given themselves
[1:03:08] to God who really has the Holy Spirit
[1:03:10] there's a sweetness about their spirit
[1:03:13] that's love
[1:03:15] that's true love
[1:03:18] when you really love your children you
[1:03:20] discipline them
[1:03:23] God's love
[1:03:25] he really loves us he takes us sometimes
[1:03:27] and he he puts us on the backside of the
[1:03:29] desert
[1:03:30] or he takes a few things from us or he
[1:03:33] makes a few things harder than normal
[1:03:38] sometimes to show us we're not as holy
[1:03:40] as we thought we were
[1:03:46] but I want I want in my life Satan to be
[1:03:49] powerless yeah
[1:03:51] yeah I want it in in our church Satan to
[1:03:54] be powerless
[1:03:57] the devil loves to sneak in and hide in
[1:04:00] the secrets hide in the the word shared
[1:04:03] or the text shared here that no one else
[1:04:05] sees
[1:04:06] he loves that he loves a
[1:04:09] a tongue that'll just go loose
[1:04:12] and gossip all over the place
[1:04:17] see Satan hates Revelation but we love
[1:04:20] it with true Revelation in our lives the
[1:04:22] Gates of Hell cannot Prevail against us
[1:04:23] but we will prevail over them
[1:04:27] and this day the scripture is fulfilled
[1:04:29] he he gives us this quote
[1:04:32] he says so the church really is in birth
[1:04:34] pains tonight again for the Deliverance
[1:04:37] of the son son of God to come again
[1:04:41] all of our theologians all of our
[1:04:43] systems all of our denominations has
[1:04:45] rotted right out from under us
[1:04:48] so we are in birth pains
[1:04:50] and a message from God always throws the
[1:04:54] church in heavier pains
[1:04:58] a message from God always throws the
[1:05:01] church in heavier pains but after a
[1:05:04] while she's going to be delivered of a
[1:05:07] bride that'll bring forth Jesus Christ
[1:05:10] to his bride
[1:05:11] and then thinking this man had disagreed
[1:05:14] with me so much when I raise up to speak
[1:05:16] this message I turn in my Bible he's
[1:05:18] sharing a story now
[1:05:22] okay I'll leave that part of the quote
[1:05:23] out just want to make the first part so
[1:05:25] we are in birth pains and the message
[1:05:27] from God always throws the church in
[1:05:30] heavier pains
[1:05:31] you see God now now you can take that
[1:05:34] that's that's the church
[1:05:36] right God starts to stir things up world
[1:05:38] over for the message Church you start
[1:05:41] seeing this and that and we're getting
[1:05:43] closer to the end as he's separating the
[1:05:46] the weed and the the weeds and the wheat
[1:05:48] and it's birth pains because God's
[1:05:51] birthing a bride from the church
[1:05:53] who's birthing Christ
[1:05:55] The Life of Christ
[1:05:57] will you bring that on down home to your
[1:05:59] own church
[1:06:01] says God God brings a word or God says
[1:06:04] something maybe it's in a service or
[1:06:06] maybe God speaks to the pastor and leads
[1:06:09] him in a certain direction it's it's
[1:06:11] it's it's a message from God
[1:06:14] now I'm not talking about just here and
[1:06:17] here I'm talking about something that's
[1:06:19] definitive everyone says wow this is
[1:06:21] happening
[1:06:22] it's birth pains and when we can when we
[1:06:24] if we get caught up if we get caught up
[1:06:27] in in trying to explain well well maybe
[1:06:30] he's making this decision because of
[1:06:31] this or maybe this person's doing this
[1:06:33] to be whatever you put you just put it
[1:06:36] in there
[1:06:38] and instead and don't focus on the fact
[1:06:40] that okay God this is happening because
[1:06:43] God you set this church up
[1:06:46] god Set us all here God put us here God
[1:06:49] brought me from Alaska to Arizona to
[1:06:51] Idaho
[1:06:53] you know
[1:06:55] Sasha and sister Julia from Washington
[1:06:58] Ukraine Washington back to Ukraine
[1:07:01] North Carolina Ohio here
[1:07:05] you see you see oh God let us here and
[1:07:07] then things get a little tricky things
[1:07:08] get a little uncomfortable
[1:07:12] or immediately start to doubt did God
[1:07:15] really but in the good times they said
[1:07:17] oh yes God sent us here when the times
[1:07:20] get hard don't just think because the
[1:07:22] times are hard well I'm doing something
[1:07:24] wrong or I'm in the wrong position look
[1:07:26] when you're in position when you're in
[1:07:28] your position the devil is going to
[1:07:29] fight you tooth and nail because he
[1:07:32] wants to do what he did to the Galatians
[1:07:36] soon remove you
[1:07:38] to soon remove you from the Gospel of
[1:07:41] Truth
[1:07:43] so that you go you can go read the book
[1:07:45] of Galatians and I'm going to too
[1:07:47] because it's not fresh enough in my mind
[1:07:49] but
[1:07:50] pandemonium chaos confusion
[1:07:53] in the church
[1:07:55] now there's situations a lot different
[1:07:57] than ours they had
[1:08:00] things going on there but
[1:08:05] we're so that we get caught up here's
[1:08:08] what I'm trying to say we get caught up
[1:08:09] in
[1:08:12] it's a person
[1:08:16] it's that person we put it we say their
[1:08:18] name in our heads
[1:08:20] instead maybe God is using them to push
[1:08:25] you a little higher
[1:08:29] because they're not necessarily doing
[1:08:31] anything wrong you just don't agree
[1:08:35] disagreement is great if you have a
[1:08:37] counsel everybody always agrees you need
[1:08:39] to get a new Council
[1:08:41] you need people in there so I really
[1:08:43] appreciate with arriving because me and
[1:08:45] him we think a little different
[1:08:47] but we always come to conclusion based
[1:08:50] on the word
[1:08:51] based on
[1:08:52] the facts presented
[1:08:55] and I'll say this and he'll bring it
[1:08:56] over here and then I'll bring it over
[1:08:58] here and he'll bring it over here right
[1:09:00] but there's if there's a love there we
[1:09:02] don't argue we don't fight
[1:09:04] we're just having a conversation we're
[1:09:06] having Fellowship
[1:09:09] and that's just an example there's other
[1:09:11] other people in my life like that
[1:09:13] and so as a church if you just expect it
[1:09:15] all to be everybody okay everyone needs
[1:09:18] to agree on the pastor that's very
[1:09:21] important but I'm talking about
[1:09:22] directions now I'm not talking about
[1:09:24] people directions of the church or or
[1:09:26] different things happening I don't know
[1:09:27] what's happening I've been traveling I
[1:09:29] don't know what's going on
[1:09:31] if there's anything going on but
[1:09:34] obviously God has something to say so
[1:09:37] I'm listening
[1:09:39] and
[1:09:40] we get caught up in in in that in the
[1:09:43] humanity of the situation
[1:09:46] we're quick to see that person's making
[1:09:48] a mistake or because it because it's
[1:09:50] affecting you negatively
[1:09:52] you say that person is making a mistake
[1:09:55] but maybe your world view is no longer
[1:09:58] aligned with God's will maybe you like
[1:10:00] the Galatians you got off somewhere
[1:10:03] if you you've got
[1:10:05] discombobulated you got
[1:10:08] because you know you just everything's
[1:10:10] happy go lucky so God likes to come in
[1:10:12] and
[1:10:13] not fluff the feather pillow remove the
[1:10:16] feather pillow
[1:10:19] to get your attention because we can't
[1:10:22] get comfortable here
[1:10:23] we can't get comfy cozy we gotta we
[1:10:26] gotta be realizing we're in a battle and
[1:10:27] we gotta fight because if we let down
[1:10:29] our guard the devil's gonna slip right
[1:10:31] into the church
[1:10:34] so
[1:10:35] the church is in birth pains he says
[1:10:37] Church natural
[1:10:39] Church spiritual there is a church
[1:10:41] natural that these women here type and
[1:10:43] there's a church spiritual also so the
[1:10:46] natural church and the spiritual church
[1:10:47] cannot be heirs together they are they
[1:10:50] are two different separate times two
[1:10:53] different separate peoples under two
[1:10:55] different separate Covenants
[1:10:57] he says that's why the Rapture is
[1:10:59] different and will only be for the Royal
[1:11:02] Seed of Abraham
[1:11:04] it cannot be come by the natural carnal
[1:11:07] seed of the church so right there you
[1:11:10] will never produce Christ based off of
[1:11:13] church doctrine
[1:11:16] now the church doctrine can be accurate
[1:11:18] but if you just receive it as well the
[1:11:22] church says it so that's it and you
[1:11:24] conform you don't be transformed
[1:11:27] you're going to you're going to find
[1:11:30] yourself
[1:11:31] focused on Humanity
[1:11:33] focus on The Human Side of the positions
[1:11:36] God has given us
[1:11:38] in the body of Christ everybody has a
[1:11:40] position you're going to get focused on
[1:11:42] the human side of things you're going to
[1:11:44] get caught up in politics and you're
[1:11:46] going to find yourself living a
[1:11:49] religious life
[1:11:51] and you're
[1:11:52] children will suffer your spiritual life
[1:11:55] will suffer oh you can have it all
[1:11:56] figured out at church but outside of the
[1:11:59] church
[1:12:00] it's a mess
[1:12:03] because you're focused see it's not it's
[1:12:05] the carnal seed of the church won't
[1:12:07] bring it but the spiritual City says it
[1:12:09] cannot come it'll have to be the Royal
[1:12:12] seed of the word of God the Roy through
[1:12:16] Abraham the Royal seed that's why he
[1:12:19] says that's why the Rapture has to be
[1:12:20] first so the Rapture is our goal getting
[1:12:24] out of here is our goal so all we can do
[1:12:27] to to to push towards that goal to press
[1:12:29] towards that goal to shake off the you
[1:12:32] know what's the spirit of late to see a
[1:12:33] laziness
[1:12:35] oh I'm just too tired you're never going
[1:12:38] to stop being tired preaching to myself
[1:12:40] now you're never going to stop being
[1:12:42] tired because the devil loves to use
[1:12:44] that you're too tired to go to church
[1:12:46] you're too tired to say Amen you're too
[1:12:48] tired to listen
[1:12:50] you're you're oh well
[1:12:52] I just you know I've I've gone through
[1:12:55] Seasons where I thought I was getting
[1:12:57] sick a lot turns out I was just lazy
[1:13:00] anybody who's home sick forgive those
[1:13:03] words
[1:13:04] unless you're home for the wrong reasons
[1:13:10] God bless the pastor
[1:13:12] I'm leaving Friday
[1:13:18] but what happens is we get we just get
[1:13:20] lazy with life
[1:13:22] lazy in life
[1:13:24] we we need to be good stewards of what
[1:13:26] God's given us good sewage of our time
[1:13:29] and it takes hard work
[1:13:32] it takes hard work
[1:13:34] to get up in the morning when you need
[1:13:36] to
[1:13:37] see I said when you need to some of us
[1:13:38] don't have to get up at four in the
[1:13:39] morning but we have to get up at seven
[1:13:42] so whatever your life is all right some
[1:13:44] of us have to get up at 10.
[1:13:47] one guys the four o'clock guy says man I
[1:13:49] wish I was the 10 o'clock guy 10 o'clock
[1:13:51] guy says man I wish I was the one
[1:13:52] o'clock guy
[1:13:54] it's all in your your perspective on
[1:13:55] where you are in your life but it's
[1:13:57] getting up when you need to and that's
[1:13:58] just not very spiritual thing to say but
[1:14:01] it's the truth
[1:14:02] and and if we we get lazy in our Natural
[1:14:06] Life you'll see that start to manifest
[1:14:08] spiritually and you start to say well I
[1:14:10] read my Bible yesterday I'll live off of
[1:14:14] that he said well over my Bible two days
[1:14:16] ago I'll live off that or I listened to
[1:14:18] a tape last week I'll I'll be good I I I
[1:14:21] need to relax I'm going to put on a you
[1:14:23] know whatever
[1:14:25] something else
[1:14:28] and instead of
[1:14:30] getting to keeping yourself from this
[1:14:33] complacency because when you get to a
[1:14:36] point of complacency when you get to a
[1:14:39] point of of this where you just well
[1:14:40] you're just kind of going through the
[1:14:42] motions
[1:14:43] the point I'm trying to make tonight is
[1:14:45] when you get to that position
[1:14:47] that's when you get off
[1:14:50] and that's when you start missing more
[1:14:53] church or that's when you start getting
[1:14:55] caught up in the politics of church or
[1:14:57] or or your Viewpoint of the the offices
[1:15:00] in the church you start to find all the
[1:15:02] faults with everybody because you got
[1:15:04] off and you lost your love
[1:15:08] but
[1:15:11] staying close to God keeps you from we
[1:15:14] constantly have to it's like it's like
[1:15:16] you're you're driving a a car that needs
[1:15:19] to be aligned right so you got the
[1:15:21] you're driving like this and you're
[1:15:23] going straight right the devil's
[1:15:24] constantly pulling it's like you're
[1:15:25] driving through the wind right you drive
[1:15:27] down the freeway the wind's blowing
[1:15:30] perpendicular to the freeway it's
[1:15:32] blowing 60 miles an hour you drive like
[1:15:34] this because you're holding the car to
[1:15:36] the wind if you just put it straight
[1:15:37] like you normally do when there's no
[1:15:38] wind you'll go flying off the road but
[1:15:40] as soon as the devil starts to buff at
[1:15:42] you you have to turn into the wind it's
[1:15:45] like when the waves in the ocean come
[1:15:47] out of ship a ship has to turn into the
[1:15:50] waves and accelerate
[1:15:52] so run towards the storm
[1:15:56] to take the waves because if you turn
[1:15:58] you try to turn a run from the waves the
[1:16:00] wave will catch you sideways and just
[1:16:02] sink your ship but you turn head on and
[1:16:05] you face the waves
[1:16:07] you accelerate the power
[1:16:09] I'm talking about a storm a storm you're
[1:16:12] you're exhausted you're cold your hands
[1:16:14] are almost Frozen to the steering wheel
[1:16:17] every bone in your body hurts
[1:16:20] and you still have to ride the wave
[1:16:25] behind every wave is another wave
[1:16:28] is one more wave
[1:16:30] at the end of every wave there's just
[1:16:32] one more that's how you have to live it
[1:16:34] say God you're in control Lord You're my
[1:16:37] anchor because you throw the anchor Out
[1:16:39] The Anchor Holds you in position but you
[1:16:41] still have to ride the waves you still
[1:16:44] have to face the ways you know it's like
[1:16:45] brother Isaac I don't know if you
[1:16:47] remember he shared that that story and
[1:16:48] I'm closing keep it short tonight
[1:16:51] of the buff I think it's the buffalo
[1:16:54] when they see a storm start to roll over
[1:16:56] the mountains and come down to the
[1:16:57] plains where they are I mean could be
[1:17:00] nasty storm they all turn and they run
[1:17:02] at the storm
[1:17:04] to get to the other side of it
[1:17:07] where it's already passed
[1:17:10] when the storms come into the church
[1:17:15] run towards them you you don't you don't
[1:17:17] run towards him on your own feet
[1:17:19] you actually don't even move at all you
[1:17:21] just get on your knees
[1:17:23] and you pray
[1:17:25] and you pray God I need Faith because I
[1:17:28] gotta trust you I need faith in
[1:17:29] Revelation I need Clarity I need
[1:17:31] leadership of the Holy Spirit God I need
[1:17:34] you most of all because I need to have
[1:17:35] love for my brother he'd have love for
[1:17:38] my sister
[1:17:39] and a passion a passion to to get up and
[1:17:42] you know it's like if you you love your
[1:17:44] job you got a passion to get up someone
[1:17:46] doesn't have to beg you to work because
[1:17:47] you're you'll love it you're right there
[1:17:49] you know you love your wife you love
[1:17:51] your family nobody has to beg you to be
[1:17:53] a good father you're just you're there
[1:17:55] you're with them you're taking care of
[1:17:56] them you're invested in them same it is
[1:17:59] with the church here
[1:18:01] you say maybe you're questioning
[1:18:03] whatever you're questioning just pray
[1:18:05] say God if you want to move me move me
[1:18:08] if you want me to be here then may it be
[1:18:11] so real and personal to me
[1:18:13] and give me
[1:18:15] let me portray The Life of Christ to
[1:18:17] have love to find a passion to support a
[1:18:21] passion to press forward because not
[1:18:24] every time when we lose Steam not every
[1:18:26] time does that mean that God wants to
[1:18:28] turn us that could just mean the devil's
[1:18:30] blowing a little bit harder
[1:18:33] let's bow our heads
[1:18:35] Lord Jesus we thank you Father tonight I
[1:18:38] mean just jumbled up but Lord I pray
[1:18:40] that you would just take it and the
[1:18:42] little nuggets here and there and you
[1:18:43] would
[1:18:44] speak to the heart of your children
[1:18:45] tonight
[1:18:46] father we just we love you and at the
[1:18:49] end of the day at the end of everything
[1:18:50] our one desire or one focus is to see
[1:18:54] you glorified is to see you magnify so
[1:18:58] see you manifested in our lives and the
[1:19:00] lives of your people
[1:19:02] and Lord that that happens through a
[1:19:04] journey that's a process Lord there's no
[1:19:07] it doesn't happen overnight it's a it's
