[0:00] and say Lord pour that into me but Lord
[0:03] don't let me set it aside let me
[0:06] understand what it is you're giving or
[0:08] moving in my life
[0:11] amen just explaining the
[0:15] baptism which ties right into godhead to
[0:18] a young man recently my brother and
[0:21] sister you see when we get just a couple
[0:23] things out of order actually it turned
[0:25] out to be a very I guess you would say
[0:27] reasonably simple process for for me to
[0:30] to do that because sometimes all you got
[0:33] to do is just get a couple things set
[0:35] back in order and and then it all
[0:37] explains itself we don't have to act
[0:39] like we're a theologian to to make this
[0:42] work and as we do that then God takes us
[0:45] back into the word he takes us right
[0:48] back to that word and he just starts
[0:50] adding more into us what's he adding not
[0:53] more theology not more of the church
[0:56] world as it were he's adding the word he
[0:59] just keeps adding the word amen that's
[1:01] why we have to stay in the word and when
[1:04] the word actually comes to you you can't
[1:06] walk away from it amen you stop and let
[1:09] God keep pouring it into you because
[1:12] what he's doing my brother and sister
[1:14] the brother brandom says it this way
[1:16] he's they're adding more power so what
[1:19] God's doing let's simplify this not call
[1:21] it doctrines and whatever and God comes
[1:23] and yesterday he poured some power into
[1:26] you and today wants to pour a little
[1:28] more power into you and tomorrow he'll
[1:30] pour more power into you and soon you'll
[1:33] look back and you'll say my we didn't
[1:36] know anything we didn't understand
[1:38] anything back here but we can't stop and
[1:40] then start building around that because
[1:42] he's got more power for us amen and when
[1:46] we will receive that power receive that
[1:49] word well it becomes to us so powerfully
[1:52] that sometimes we
[1:54] doubt Revelation can be so strong that
[1:58] we can't comprehend Hind and we pull
[2:01] back but that's not what God wants us to
[2:03] do he wants us to walk and receive that
[2:07] he wants us to add to what's already
[2:10] been revealed to us can you say amen
[2:14] amen the Lord's still adding he's still
[2:17] adding my brother and sister there is no
[2:20] way I'm going to make this as an
[2:21] emphatic statement because I believe it
[2:23] with all of my might we talk about we
[2:25] won't understand Jesus Christ uh our
[2:28] Lord through through time and Eternity
[2:31] but I'll tell you we'll still be digging
[2:33] things out of this message right to the
[2:36] day of the Rapture God will still use
[2:39] this word to speak Revelation right to
[2:42] the day of the Rapture because this is
[2:44] his word and it cannot come to an end it
[2:48] has to continue to expand itself amen
[2:53] the Lord is still adding to us amen i'
[2:56] like to just read a little bit out of
[2:58] the sermon countdown when I say a little
[3:00] bit it's
[3:02] actually I don't know five six
[3:05] paragraphs here but they're short
[3:09] ones now notice all these
[3:12] things go back and catch this brother
[3:14] brandom's talking and you should be able
[3:17] to follow this here he's talking about
[3:18] the airplane and all these other things
[3:20] in science progressing moving forward
[3:23] Etc now notice all these things are
[3:26] achievement that man has achieved only
[3:29] are types and shadows of what God is
[3:32] doing yeah now taking what brother
[3:35] bram's talking about right here if
[3:37] you'll just give me a little moment of
[3:40] Grace you know lately I've mentioned to
[3:42] you about what woke is right the whole
[3:46] woke thing going on in the world oh woke
[3:48] woke yeah got to this and that Satan's
[3:51] imitating the bride of Christ waking up
[3:54] that's true amen and every one of these
[3:57] things he he's perverted the rainbow
[4:00] he's doing every one of these I don't
[4:01] want to keep going on through this the
[4:03] list can be quite extensive but look at
[4:05] what Satan's doing he is following
[4:08] because he's seeing after the fact what
[4:11] God's doing and he jumps right in to
[4:13] imitate it amen my brother and sister
[4:16] that's the world of clothes I sorry I'm
[4:19] I don't want to be too derogatory but
[4:21] that's what Walmart is
[4:24] amen a whole
[4:26] Marketplace of things that somebody else
[4:28] thought of and they produce it
[4:31] cheaper they give it out that's what
[4:34] Satan's
[4:35] doing what's it cost you if you follow
[4:39] me here what's it cost you to be
[4:42] woke you got to pray you got to read
[4:46] your Bible you got to be surrendered to
[4:48] the Lord and God is awakening us as a
[4:52] bride of Christ waking us up to be woke
[4:56] in the
[4:57] world you can be anything you want to be
[5:00] you don't even hardly really have to pay
[5:01] a price other than just dressing Goofy
[5:04] and whatever but you see Satan he's
[5:09] offering the cheap
[5:11] version and our culture says I can get
[5:14] something for
[5:15] nothing that's what I want that's why
[5:19] real Christians are becoming rare is
[5:22] because their
[5:23] sacrifice involved with being awakened
[5:26] to the gospel if you want a ref
[5:29] reference scripturally to that just go
[5:31] to the Saints on the road to emus and
[5:34] you'll see them becoming woke hope you
[5:37] don't mind me putting it that way you
[5:39] will see them becoming woke as they
[5:41] walked Christ is pouring into them
[5:44] pouring into them and at the breaking of
[5:47] the bread they come completely awake of
[5:50] who they were and whose presence they
[5:52] were in and Satan says man great plan I
[5:56] got to try that and it works for him
[6:00] but it won't work on
[6:02] you amen so all these achievements that
[6:06] man has achieved only are types and
[6:08] shadows of what God is doing he always
[6:11] does it that way he has told us the
[6:13] signs that would be in the skies the
[6:16] things that would be happening just
[6:17] before the coming of Christ we see that
[6:20] now it's only a pointing post and we see
[6:24] science how they have achieved and how
[6:27] God has achieved by his
[6:31] church so the whole world's all focused
[6:33] on what science has
[6:36] done in the meantime the church that's
[6:39] you is achieving Milestone after
[6:43] Milestone after Milestone as revelation
[6:46] after revelation after Revelation is
[6:48] coming to you amen that's why the
[6:51] prophet could Clearly say you won't be
[6:53] the same person you was yesterday
[6:56] because God is allowing us to achieve
[6:59] and step into the word and then
[7:01] ultimately we become the word and when
[7:04] we have become the word my brother and
[7:06] sister the intrinsic connection between
[7:08] you and Christ cannot be
[7:10] severed it's a beautiful thing does man
[7:14] ride in an
[7:17] airplane he don't want no horse and
[7:19] buggy no more unless he's just wanting a
[7:21] little fun but the horse and buggy
[7:24] remember what is the power in the
[7:26] airplane just more horses added that's
[7:29] all
[7:30] so when John Wesley found
[7:32] sanctification they set aside work from
[7:35] justification he never condemned
[7:38] justification he only added more power
[7:41] to it amen now let's think about this in
[7:44] a very very broad cross-section here and
[7:48] when the Pentecostals and now he's
[7:50] talking about the real Pentecostals when
[7:52] the Pentecostals found the baptism of
[7:54] the Holy Ghost and the restoration of
[7:56] the gifts they never denied sanctify
[7:59] ification or justification they just got
[8:02] more power and raised up and went up
[8:05] because he found more
[8:07] power now I believe I don't believe I'm
[8:10] out of line here to sa if we can insert
[8:13] subpart to paragraph 48 and when the
[8:17] bride realized who she was amen she
[8:20] didn't say that Pentecostal movement is
[8:22] just nonsense she didn't say that this
[8:25] sanctification nonsense justification
[8:28] nonsense amen the word of God come to
[8:30] you and I and can we admit it tonight
[8:33] maybe even lift a hand or not ahead and
[8:35] say has God not poured his power into
[8:38] this bride of Christ amen we're not
[8:40] sitting here just theologically fumbling
[8:43] through pages and quotes and scriptures
[8:46] and saying this has become a real Living
[8:48] Word in you and I amen it's there more
[8:52] power amen as you step beyond that the
[8:54] prophet talks about the eighth day and
[8:57] we can not necessarily go into that and
[8:59] we can talk about how that that's
[9:01] stepping over another boundary as it is
[9:04] into the beginning once again what was
[9:06] in the beginning my brother and sister
[9:08] the power of the spoken word as God
[9:10] created and it's come now into our day
[9:13] and we are here in the prophet of God
[9:15] said it's time for you and I to speak
[9:19] amen it's time for us to declare who we
[9:22] are and what God has given us not sit
[9:25] back and say well I I need a quote for
[9:27] this now don't get me wrong I try to
[9:30] base everything I do and preach out of
[9:32] the quotes to make sure that I don't get
[9:34] out of line but there comes a time in
[9:36] our life that God moving in our lives my
[9:38] brother and sister we don't need a quote
[9:40] we need to release ourself to the power
[9:43] of the Holy Ghost which is God in you
[9:46] Christ in you wanting you to speak over
[9:49] that baby to speak over that sister
[9:51] speak over that friend or family in
[9:53] Nevada speak over these things because
[9:56] God has given you and I the power of the
[9:58] spoken word we have come back into that
[10:01] day where God would like to hear his
[10:03] bride
[10:05] speak
[10:07] amen I hope I'm not too carried away
[10:10] tonight amen now look at
[10:13] these he goes on to say here all those
[10:17] things foreshadowing as they come up if
[10:20] we had time we could really stay on that
[10:22] but we haven't but he raised up as
[10:24] science achieves something Looking
[10:26] Backward God achieves going this way
[10:29] going forward to the kingdom I tell you
[10:32] I thank the Lord for that going forward
[10:34] to the kingdom amen now we find you see
[10:39] you understand what he's really saying
[10:40] there it's not just being a Christian
[10:43] and going to church no sir we're on a
[10:46] kingdom Journey we're not a journey to
[10:48] church we're on a kingdom Journey amen
[10:51] stepping out as Sons and Daughters of
[10:54] God hallelujah you know brother Donnie
[10:56] Reagan preached it this way many years
[10:58] ago I've never forgot the analogy he
[11:00] said the problem is instead of us
[11:02] getting in the center of the road of the
[11:03] word we plow this ditch for a while then
[11:06] we run over and we plow this ditch for a
[11:09] while God wants us centered amen he
[11:12] wants us to have a revelation and
[11:14] understanding of the word and go right
[11:16] down that Center amen not plowing
[11:22] ditches Hallelujah sorry I've been a
[11:25] little
[11:26] excited I can tell you right now just
[11:29] had kind of a messed up whatever
[11:32] afternoon and the devil just trying to
[11:36] just put the brakes on
[11:38] everything amen I don't know where the
[11:41] wagon's going but the brakes are
[11:43] off
[11:47] amen now we go right down here now we
[11:50] find from isua Street the planes took
[11:54] off in great revivals and swept the
[11:56] world to the unknown and the Heavenly
[11:58] places speaking unknown tongues with
[12:01] unknown gifts to the world why they
[12:04] thought they were
[12:07] Fanatics aren't you glad to be called a
[12:12] fanatic it's offensive in the
[12:17] flesh but when we look back in the word
[12:19] and says and they will worship in a way
[12:22] that is called
[12:25] heresy I wish I could remember the words
[12:32] I can't remember which one of those
[12:34] colored Brothers back e spoke that but
[12:37] he had a nice little sing song
[12:41] There Worship in the way they say say
[12:45] the way they do he do he everything they
[12:48] this and this and this and we'll settle
[12:51] for just simple
[12:55] heresy my
[12:59] everybody wants to be accepted by
[13:01] everybody yeah I wouldn't even name
[13:04] names so you don't bother to even try
[13:05] and search and find it but just recently
[13:08] there's a man of somewhat significant
[13:10] importance in the world of
[13:12] religion is waiting for the day of full
[13:19] Unity they're anointed they're looking
[13:21] for
[13:22] it they know it's coming and they want
[13:26] it see quite a difference of it being
[13:29] forced on
[13:31] them get
[13:33] this they want
[13:37] it now what type in Shadow are they
[13:42] of there's a bride many membered body on
[13:47] the Earth today a
[13:49] bride who wants this Unity it's not
[13:54] going to be
[13:55] forced they seek it desire amen pray for
[14:00] it it's not going to be a government
[14:02] it's not going to be a hierarchy it is
[14:06] the one we have always longed for a
[14:10] Unity with our Lord Jesus
[14:12] Christ amen they comment these
[14:15] branhamites have a strange Unity amongst
[14:18] them even though they
[14:20] fight well I tell you the day will come
[14:23] that the spirit of contesting over the
[14:26] message will either turn to denomination
[14:28] or bring that Deliverance the word
[14:30] talked about amen some will go to that
[14:33] route you got to be unified with us some
[14:35] are going to be looking way above the
[14:37] head of man saying there's my Unity his
[14:40] name is Jesus Christ amen there's my
[14:44] unity and I want it to come and I want
[14:46] my brothers and sisters to have that
[14:48] same kind of
[14:49] unity
[14:54] amen I just love how brother Brown says
[14:56] now we find from isua Street the planes
[14:58] took took off great Revival swept the
[15:00] world to the unknown into Heavenly
[15:02] places speaking unknown tongues unknown
[15:05] gifts to the world why they thought they
[15:08] were fanatics but they had been able God
[15:10] got a group of people in his
[15:14] hands Hallelujah do you realize tonight
[15:17] you'd say well I I I don't know am I in
[15:20] God's hands you know I believe what the
[15:21] prophet said I don't believe those
[15:23] accidental words God's got his hand if
[15:25] we could have our spiritual eyes open
[15:27] tonight God's Got his hand around us
[15:30] tonight and he's leading us and guiding
[15:32] us as a promise of the word and he said
[15:35] I'm going to take you where to all truth
[15:38] amen and the whole sum of all truth is
[15:41] you in the throne on the sea of Crystal
[15:44] with him that's the summation of all
[15:47] truth it doesn't end up short of that it
[15:49] doesn't end up just outside the gates it
[15:51] doesn't end up on the road or the
[15:53] journey my brother and sister the sum of
[15:55] the all truth is you and I in his
[15:58] presence for eternity that's the
[16:00] summation of truth
[16:05] hallelujah and he got a
[16:08] little boy we'd almost be thrown in jail
[16:10] to say this
[16:13] today got a little cross-eyed negro man
[16:16] down there in isua street that had no
[16:20] more sense than to believe what God
[16:24] Said oh I want to be like that
[16:27] man Lord just just let us be like that
[16:30] man crosseyed and all if necessary to
[16:33] have no more sense than to believe all
[16:36] that God said amen oh Hallelujah all
[16:40] what God Said was truth that's right
[16:43] amen hallelujah that's what we want to
[16:45] come to the Way Up Is Down amen not to
[16:49] come with our finery and come with our
[16:52] deal everything pronounced correctly I'd
[16:54] flunk that anyhow but anyway you know my
[16:56] brother and sister just come to that
[16:58] place to real
[16:59] that God didn't care about phds and llds
[17:03] and and doctors of divinities and all of
[17:07] this God didn't care he come down to a
[17:10] little cross-eyed negro right little man
[17:14] forget forget about those words in a
[17:16] sense he come down to our
[17:18] brother and anointed him to just simply
[17:23] believe is that man worth more to God
[17:25] than you
[17:29] then God will come down to you and I
[17:31] that's right he'll come right down when
[17:33] we come to the place that we have no
[17:35] more sense than to just believe the word
[17:38] amen when we don't find a reason not to
[17:42] when we find a reason just to surrender
[17:44] right and say
[17:46] Lord I have no more sense amen right may
[17:50] I be as a dumb
[17:53] animal and just follow yes what I have
[17:57] follow the instinct
[17:59] how many stories has there been through
[18:01] the ages of someone lost in the desert
[18:04] and finally they turned their little
[18:05] burrow
[18:06] loose and they just followed it and it
[18:10] took them to
[18:11] water oh my brother and sister could we
[18:14] just turn loose and let the Holy Ghost
[18:16] it just let the presence of God just
[18:19] lead us into the word lead us into a
[18:22] life like we've never had before Amen to
[18:26] an understanding of what the message is
[18:29] I don't want to sound like I'm some guy
[18:30] flying off the edge please don't think
[18:32] of that but I'm wondering my brothers
[18:34] and sisters I've spoke here at the
[18:36] church I'm wondering if we even
[18:38] understand what the message is about we
[18:41] we've brought so many ideas from so many
[18:43] ways and and this must mean this and
[18:46] must mean that how about we just let go
[18:48] and follow amen instead of trying to
[18:51] lead let us follow and let God work in
[18:54] our life cuz he promised I'll lead you
[18:56] and guide you to all truth truth and we
[18:59] shouldn't doubt that at all we shouldn't
[19:01] question that at
[19:03] all we were up in Canada I told the man
[19:05] up there I says you just let go this is
[19:07] God's promis amen this is God's promise
[19:10] let go and let God lead you to all truth
[19:14] right exactly amen because they're
[19:15] concerned a little bit just a very short
[19:17] information on that you know they've
[19:19] just uh realizing where they been for
[19:22] years there's some things wrong there
[19:24] some things undercurrent stuff and you
[19:26] know then you look up and there's
[19:28] there's people everywhere Believers come
[19:30] here Believers come here come here come
[19:33] here and the brother said I I I just
[19:37] Lord I I I need you I don't
[19:39] know just let go brother amen just
[19:43] stop he made a promise to you he is
[19:48] going to lead you to all
[19:51] truth hallelujah thank you Lord amen I
[19:56] didn't find truth I didn't create truth
[19:58] can't interpret truth but I can follow
[20:01] truth amen hallelujah amen oh
[20:10] hallelujah what do we say in this
[20:13] day the very same thing has been I
[20:16] believe presented to us who do you say
[20:20] that's right I am that's and I believe
[20:23] it comes and I'm sorry to say it this
[20:25] way forgive me but some don't have the
[20:28] right answer
[20:32] no you see I believe we being filled
[20:34] with the Holy Ghost have been
[20:37] Anointed The Very expression of the
[20:43] word who do you say I
[20:47] am I think we can say with
[20:50] confidence you are Christ amen in me
[20:54] that's right that's how I can identify
[20:57] you Christ in me and that is my Hope Of
[21:02] Glory Hallelujah I don't want to Loosely
[21:04] interpret that but my brother and sister
[21:06] it's got to come down we see him so
[21:07] personal that our problems are not our
[21:10] problems and our glory is not our Glory
[21:15] it's all in him amen amen Christ moving
[21:20] amen going back to those of you just a
[21:24] very quick little lesson Matthew 16 to
[21:28] those of you that maybe haven't seen
[21:31] cesaria Philippi and maybe with the
[21:34] craziness of the world won't get an
[21:36] opportunity but what you have is a
[21:39] stream that flows from the
[21:41] rock everpresent

[21:48] Rock and they had a temple to this God

[21:55] this God and this God and this God
[21:59] yeah and Jesus is there with the
[22:01] disciples standing there if you don't

[22:06] before that and they're looking at all
[22:10] of these
[22:11] temples of all of these
[22:15] gods and Jesus says to the
[22:19] apostles who do you say I am
[22:24] yeah got all the favorite religions of
[22:27] the day

[22:37] see he was the
[22:39] temple that's right amen and those
[22:43] Apostles my brother and sister I've

[23:29] it's re Revelation right there on the
[23:31] hoof that's it right there standing
[23:34] before
[23:37] Jesus and that
[23:39] anointing was not Peter's
[23:42] anointing that was God putting those
[23:45] words in Peter's mouth and when he spoke
[23:49] those words oh bear with me I hope I
[23:51] don't sound like a heretic when he spoke
[23:54] those words a lightning streak went down
[23:57] through his history and struck you amen
[24:01] come all the way down through history
[24:04] struck our heart amen the scripture says
[24:08] without the Holy Ghost we can't even say
[24:10] that Jesus is the Christ and here we sit
[24:13] today my brother and sister not only
[24:15] saying he's the Christ but we can say
[24:17] he's in me and that word is me amen it
[24:21] is not just religion it's not a follower
[24:24] that word is me and I'm standing here
[24:28] today to manifest my Lord Jesus and just
[24:31] as he sent them forth with a message in
[24:33] that day we stand here today with a life
[24:36] that is living in this Dark World
[24:40] hallelujah
[24:42] amen you look at that and can only
[24:45] imagine remember the artist's drawings
[24:48] that they had of what those temples
[24:49] looked like back in
[24:51] history pretty
[24:53] Grand pretty
[24:56] incredible yeah
[24:58] look like a lot of the churches
[25:02] today but he wasn't
[25:05] there he was standing in humanity right
[25:09] in front of it and you are that
[25:12] Humanity you are the one he is in today
[25:16] Hallelujah not the columns not the high
[25:19] roofs not the Magnificent whatevers but
[25:22] you amen amen it's Christ in you that
[25:26] makes you what you are exactly isn't
[25:28] that nice takes the pressure off of us
[25:31] amen not an excuse but just takes the
[25:33] pressure off of it God knows what I need
[25:35] he's going to give it to me amen when
[25:38] when I'm hungry as it is he he
[25:40] satisfies just today I'm sorry trying to
[25:44] break the habit of throwing sister Jerry
[25:46] under the bus but it's a hard habit to
[25:49] break amen but just today sister Jerry's
[25:51] like look at this
[25:53] quote man incredible
[25:57] quote I read it to you

[26:06] thinking almost as though I said hey
[26:09] research assistant find me a quote that
[26:11] fulfills this and this and this and this
[26:15] instead God just makes her excited about
[26:17] a quote and when I read the quote I'm
[26:19] like that's exactly right amen
[26:23] hallelujah because God wants to speak
[26:25] now some people get upset about the idea
[26:26] that my wife shared a quote with me and
[26:28] then I used it I want to put a
[26:30] disclaimer right here she did not force
[26:35] me it was my
[26:40] choice okay so don't look bad on
[26:43] Jerry but you see any one of you could
[26:46] share the quote and it would have been
[26:48] just as exciting to me because God knows
[26:52] that we're human had a little disaster
[26:55] this afternoon I'll just throw it out to
[26:56] you real quick you know I was like like

[27:11] frantic in case you're wondering why I
[27:13] look like I
[27:14] do but you see my brother and sister
[27:17] then God comes along and
[27:19] says I'll just share this with
[27:23] you hope that doesn't offend you no
[27:31] see it's Christ in you
[27:34] amen if we could catch a revelation of
[27:37] that
[27:38] scripture how our lives would be
[27:43] changed amen amen we would literally
[27:47] have the confidence to rebuke Satan any
[27:53] time anywhere any
[27:56] circumstance amen
[27:58] binding him yeah not in our name in his
[28:03] name amen hallelujah sister VI if you
[28:06] would
[28:08] come Lord help us to be bold amen I
