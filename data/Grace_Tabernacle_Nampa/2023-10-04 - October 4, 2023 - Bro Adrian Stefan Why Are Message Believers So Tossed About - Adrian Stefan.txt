your love I wouldn't want to be you gave your life my heart to you I give Jesus you are all the [Music] worldship God bless you tonight it's good to be in the the house of the Lord I always say it and I repeat myself and I don't feel sorry but it's a true blessing to still be able to gather in the house of the Lord you know sometimes we as Christians we take things from granted and the only way we can appreciate them is when they're taken away from us and in many parts of the world Christians they fear when they meet at any time they expect somebody to come in and and arrest them or they even risk their life but today we are happy to be in the house of the Lord It's a true blessing that we are still free to Worship the Lord as we can see things are going so wrong in this world for how long we don't know let's hope we're going to be in Glory by that time but as we can say today blessed be the name of the Lord that we can still come in the house of the Lord God bless you tonight tonight as we open our Bibles for the readings I would like to read from Hebrews thank you musicians Hebrews chapter 4 starting with verse 9 to verse 12 Hebrews chapter 4 9 10 11 and 12 there remain there a rest to the people of God for he that has entered into his rest he also has ceased from his own works as God did for his let us labor therefore to enter into that rest amen right lest any man fall after the same example of unbelief amen that's right for the word of God is quick powerful and sharper than any two-edged sword piercing even to the dividing aunder of the soul and the spirit amen and the joints the joints and Marrow and is a discerner of the thoughts and intents of the heart let's bow our heads dear heavenly father as we read your word this evening Lord Lord we ask you to bless us this evening with your word Lord and speak to the people tonight Lord as they came to hear your word Lord Lord take myself out of the way Lord I don't want anything to do with myself Lord and I ask you to bless me and use my mouth Lord As You Wish Lord amen we ask you all these things in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ amen amen you may have your seats the Lord put on my heart a message and if you were to ask me if you ever want to preach one message and be done it'll probably be this message as we're about to see brother brandham and his ministry came especially one of the reasons was for this message that I'm about to preach and brother Brenan preached a message in 1956 which is called War are people so tossed about exactly right and that message changed my life that was one of the message it was 1956 I believe if I'm not mistaken 1956 January that's correct that message changed my life completely until then I was just a message believer but that's not enough that is not enough and that's why my message tonight and and one other very important point that I want to point out as message belie Believers and and of course I'm coming from a Pentecostal background but it's very easy for us to point fingers exactly but the only finger that should be pointed is towards us amen it's very easy to look in somebody else's yard and say well look at their weeds well when was the last time we looked in our yard we get so busy looking into somebody else's yard that we miss what's in our own life may the Lord help us with that that's exactly so my message tonight is entitled why are message Believers so tossed about that's right and you may say brother Adrian that's kind of message Believers toss about bet well if you don't have rest you're toss about that's right the only way you're not going to be tossed about as we're going to see in this message is when you receive full rest amen and as we read in the Bible who's going to give you that rest the Lord Jesus Christ that's amen amen I I want to talk a little bit about how the Lord spoke to me in this message because I really believe that's very important um coming from a Pentecostal background I'm not going to go into a details you probably know very well what they believe in and and and everything but my I was fellowshipping with some brothers and and I know the Lord Was preparing me and I was there for a season and it helped me to see how they believe now I told the brothers I never believed in the Trinity every time somebody would mention the Trinity some something was was bothering me I I wanted to get out of the church when they mentioned that it just it just didn't suit me it didn't make any sense and and and when you see how indoctrinated they are in that belief that's right and I've heard many many brothers say this I I haven't heard it myself personally but many people pray to Jesus and then they forget to pray to God so they come back and say well and and then they try to divide the time equally so they're not offending the other it's a mess right that's right it's a mess is but the bride knows yes why because in the last day that's right sir the son of man will be revealed we're not any better than them we can't I can't say I'm better than them it's the mercy of God that chose us from the beginning and and I love the example that brother Bram gives with the piece of material well you have to start somewhere so he starts cutting starts cutting starts cutting and here you are here I am amen does that mean the other piece of material is bad no but he has to start somewh right and he chose us isn't that wonderful glory to God praise be God and you know me and my wife we got married and that's when I really began to be interested in the message because for us church was just a place of where you went uh it was nice it was good we sang songs um we hang out at the church we didn't do anything bad um but I just felt like we were just playing church and I got desperate and I said Lord there's two options I'm either going to pretend to be somebody that I'm not I'm going to pretend that I'm worshiping you and doing all these things or I'm going to truly worship you yes and that's when I got really serious about the message I have heard about the message for a very long time um have we've never had a connection with the with the message CH so it it was very hard for us to we had so many questions we knew it was a good message we knew about brother bam but we just had so many questions and so what I did personally I started asking asking the Lord Lord is if this is the true message show me reveal to me I don't want what brother X and brother Y is saying I want a personal revelation is this truly you and so I started researching the message and in the back of my mind I was thinking let's see where this message goes because pretty much all other messages they go to a good point and then fall off and you're like well it was good until now but that that's not in the Bible so I was reading the message with the idea of there's going to be probably an edge somewhere where the message is going to fall off well I haven't found it so the Lord was merciful to me and and and to my family and so we believed the message we renounced everything that we had and we started going to Brother David mcgeer's church with many of of you know him and it was a blessing and a true testimony my wife was raised Pentecostal as well I knew about the message since I was a little kid uh as my grandpa uh first heard about the message but back in the day there was no me messages on iPads and so you you know you you you just had to you what it was available and they had to translate in Romania I'm originally from Romania and so whatever was translated in Romanian is what you heard but even to to this day not all the messages are translated so it's very hard when somebody translates something it also gets lost in the translation that's that's just the truth I know the brothers are doing the best they can to translate everything but it just gets so much lost I can see how my grandfather is reading some messages and it could be totally misunderstood because of the translation difficulties EXA and so we um started going to the church and basically the main reason why we we wanted to leave everything behind we started having kids so me and my wife we got married and we had children and when we would go to their Church to the Pentecostal Church many kids had iPads in their hands and they were watching cartoons while the church was going on so we I looked at my wife and I said if this is church I don't want to be part of this because pretty soon my kids are going to ask what why can I have an iPad why can I watch you know whatever they were watching and so we got really serious about it and so we said we're going to leave everything we're going to start going to the other church and we're going to see how it is so we started going to that church and Saints as soon as we walked into that door we never looked back not even one day we said this is what we want whatever they're serving is we basically saw the love of God on their face Lord when the service was done we just didn't want to leave we stayed as long as the piano was playing we stayed there when the piano turned off we even stayed there we didn't want to leave why because the presence of God was there the presence of God was there but Saints as we're about to see that's not enough enough there's another step that's right am why are message Believers so to about that's right message Believers tossed about well it's been a few years we got deeper into the message we got deeper into the message we thought everything was good but every once in a while I would say a lie felt bad about it but I kept going I said Lord felt y doing some things that I wasn't supposed to I knew it wasn't right I knew I had to repent for them but I never had the strength to go to the next step and I want to read a little bit from uh why are people so tossed about paragraph 62 because this is why it's very important to have rest in God Amen in Matthew 11:28 it says this come onto me all ye that labor and are heavy laden and I will give you rest my heart was Desiring that rest y amen I was tossed about sure I was going to a message Church sure we were not doing nothing out of the ordinary but Saints let me tell you something you can deceive the pastor you can even deceive your wife that's right yes but what good does that do where can you hide from the face of God is there a place you can hide no way no you cannot hide from the face of God so I want to read paragraph 62 I'm not sure if the brothers can put it up on the board but it's uh uh why are people so talked about paragraph 62 and uh brother bream starts uh describing this uh condition and as I started listening the conviction came and I feel like brother Brown was talking directly to me church when the word of God Goes Forth there's no way he will return void God has a perfect time of maturity for each and every one of us amen paragraph 62 I said the Christian faith is based solidly upon restl that's right amen a Christian is not tossed about a Christian doesn't run for place to place a Christian doesn't fuss and fume and worry about things a Christian rests it's all over it's all finished for the believer at Calvary that's right all sickness may come and disappointments but the Christian is at rest knowing this that God is is able to keep that which he has performed amen knowing that no matter what the things is and how it looks there's neither sickness sorrow death there is neither starvation or anything that can separate us from the love of God that's in Jesus Christ amen amen I love the example because some uh brothers and sisters they believe that if they have a sickness that maybe they're cursed I love the example that brother Brenham gives and I don't remember exactly which sermon but he's saying that a Shepherd hit one of the sheeps on the leg and she was limping and somebody asked her why did you hit the ship perfectly perfect why'd you break her leg and then he starts to explain see the reason why I did it is because I love her amen and everybody was confused what do you mean you love her you just hit her you broke her leg see you don't understand amen but she loves to wander she loves to go places where I don't want her to be because it's not safe for her so have you ever thought about that if God allows something upon you maybe it's because he loves you he says the ones that I love what do I do I Chas amen blessed be the Lord see just because sickness or Sorrows comes we should be ATR rest that's a that's a place where God wants us to be just let The Old Ship toss any way she wants to that's right the anchor is doing the holding amen who's doing the holding not your sickness not you not your wife it's Christ he's the anchor that holds amen my faith 66 paragraph 66 my faith doesn't anchor in what the coming meetings will be that's very important my faith doesn't rest in only any ability that I have that I would have or upon a church I should join or what people I should associate with my faith anchors and rest entirely upon the finished work of the Lord Jesus Christ already been received that's it amen hallelujah it doesn't matter what the pastor is doing your rest is not based on what the pastor's doing that's exactly right it's not based on what your wife is doing or your husband is doing it doesn't matter don't worry about somebody leaving the message no that's right that's not what your faith should be on that's right you have your own rest you have your own personal revelation amen with the Lord amen right I want to go to paragraph 70 because this is where brother Branham starts to explain the condition of the people and this is where the Lord convicted me amen and I found myself right here paragraph 70 you find them people who seem to be very religious seem to have such a deep desire and daily they search and hunt and seek God and never come to any settlement of any kind to where they could ever be settled or Anchored In Christ that's right and this I have learned to be in experience that is what people with people with of intellectual amen and I love how brother Benham says it's not here no no sir it's right here that's the difference that's you will never be able to understand this message intellectually that's right if you're going to try to do it you'll be all confused that's right why because God revealed it to who to babes he didn't make it complicated he revealed himself to the simple people why because he's a simple God and he loves to reveal himself the same way praise be to God and one of them is an intellectual paragraph 72 or a or a mental conception of go of what God Said in his word and Jesus Christ by the way of knowledge and the other is an experimental experience that God has given the man in his heart amen the one intellectual is hungering he is feasting on God but his Feast doesn't hold out that's right amen the other one seems to have Victory all the time there's nothing Brothers there's nothing Brothers them nothing bothers them they're just as solid un anchored as they can be no trials no storms bothers them at all but they seem to have something about them that people who are Christians are trying to live for God admire that type of Christian amen amen many people go to services and rejoice and shout and praise the Lord while the spirit of God is falling all condemnation has left a heart as soon as a day or two after Revival they find themselves back in the old grind again amen so this is where the Lord starts convicting me because in church it feels great you come to church you feel like you can conquer anything but as soon as you leave yeah that's exactly that stays right there you know why because your Fire gets lit from other brothers and sisters in church that's right but when you go home you're empty that's it it doesn't hold out the food that you just ate it's gone that's it that's exactly right and I love to make an association how many people has used perfume I have well when you pass by somebody at Walmart you feel that smell right oh he smells good good but as soon as he's gone it's gone with the perfume right so it's gone but if you're the one that has the perfume you smell all the time it doesn't matter who's passing by you that's exactly how it is when you have the fire of God in you you're always lighting it doesn't matter what trial comes you're always happy you're always blessing somebody you're always praying for somebody you're always you're always concerned about uh Salvation you go to Walmart you think God doesn't want to use you there I call it Walmart preaching I 50 that's right I we always have to have an open mind Lord I'm not just here to buy milk that's right who do I need to encourage that's right maybe you don't even have to speak to somebody maybe just a smile that's right that can make somebody's day amen may the Lord help us to be sensible to that you're not just at Walmart on a random that's shopping spree no that's right pay attention maybe God wants to show you something maybe God wants to show me something absolutely amen yes sir paragraph 89 many people come to Christ which had which was never been able in the pentec world to make the Pentecostal people see the fundamental truth it's so hard because each church has its Doctrine and they hear their Pastor daily their evangelist speak something they say oh well I got it that what difference does it make well coming from a Pentecostal background all you got to do is just speak in tongues that's all you got to do but you know what the problem problem with that is true the devil can interpret that he's the best speaker in tongues of all he can he can produce that that's the problem that's not a sign you have the Holy Spirit no it is not then why didn't the Bible say you will know them by the way they speak in tongues is that what the Bible says that's not what it says you will know them by by their fruits why because he will never be able to impersonate that he will never be able to love he will never be able to have longsuffering that's not him he can't do it praise God paragraph 101 I've met people who would stand in church and rejoice and see them go outside of the church and maybe Monday or Tuesday one just living unbehaved people accept Divine Healing oh this is a big one say oh yes I see it it's in the word oh thank you Lord I believe it now how many people and brother brenham's meetings got healed thousands that's right and very many of them were back maybe in a year or two if not with the same problem with a different problem it was a repeat why because they never found the rest amen now what we just showed you was the condition of the people now I want to go to the True Believer because brother Bram says there's there's uh different uh Believers in church the unbeliever the make believer the make believer wow that's that's a big one that's a faker he fakes it and it's worse than the unbeliever in my opinion now the True Believer paragraph 104 did you ever meet a person that's been in there and has tasted and living of this Mana you can meet him on Monday Tuesday Wednesday Thursday Friday Saturday or Sunday cloudy day Bright Day gloomy day things going right they go wrong he's always sweet always full of love never to talk or do anything wrong he's living under the glory of God he never gets hungry he never has to go to church to get built up he is just always full of God this is where I said Lord that's what I want to be amen yes sir this is where I want to be I don't want to just do it for myself but I want to do it for others I want to bring others to you and and in this time of my life life the Lord was really dealing with me about the ministry and to be honest with you while we were at the Pentecostal church I really had a bad taste in my mouth for for the ministering because the way I grew up and as you probably know it's it's very it's a very they love to like fight and you know who wants to be the pastor who wants to be the Deacon who you know and then nobody's happy when one person shows up because you know they're not related it's just a huge mess and I looked at all that and I said I never want to do anything like that that's not love you preach about love but you go outside and you fight with somebody how how how does that make any that that just makes you a hypocrite that's what it is and so I had a very bad taste in my mouth and you know the Lord was was dealing with me and and was you know placing uh Stranges on my heart to go testify to them and I said Lord I don't why why is why is why is this happening to me but the Lord wanted to take me through a step and get me prepared for what he wants me to do and we'll see that in just a second but basically I told the Lord and I said Lord if you really want me to work for you and if you want me to do something for you please speak to me personally I don't want to just do it because somebody else is doing it you know I I I already have a bad taste in my mouth from the past if you're sending me Lord I want to do what you want me to do but I want you to confirm to me 100% sure that that's what you want me to do and Saints I'm not going to go into details but the Lord revealed to me right that night how he wants to use me and it's it's just so amazing when you get on your knees and and you pray sincerely and the Lord shows up and he answers that was probably for me the closest relationship that I had with the Lord until then and and it's and it's you cannot trade that for nothing else when you you ask the Lord for something and he shows up right then and there it's it's it's a it's a great feeling and and it fills you with joy the joy of the holy spirit amen paragraph 112 the heart is in the Abode of God and in the Old Testament God dwelt In His glory over the ark and the heart is the ark God dwells not in the head in the heart God is not known by theology God is known God is not known by a mental conception God is known by an oldfashioned Sanctified Born Again experience that's in the human heart amen yet men and women live a good life and love God by mental conception right but the real hiding place is in the heart hid with Christ amen amen paragraph 114 Paul said to me to live is Christ and to die is gain not me that live it anymore but Christ that lives in me amen I want to make a pause here I pointed out to a couple of my family M members which are still Pentecostal and I said did you see what Apostle Paul said here and they had a reason for it and they said well he didn't really mean it that way because if you really go by what he says nobody would be saved and I'm just so we're just going to start cutting the Bible and just take what or are you just looking for a way to commit sin it's basically the way I'm looking at it because if Christ lives in you then how can you say a lie can Christ say a lie no no if Christ lives in you can you do some shady things under the table he wouldn't do it if he truly lives in you would you be unfaithful to your wife sir not for a million dollars you see that's the difference and I love how brother bam explains I believe it's in the message uh from then on from that time that's the message from that time and he says how can a woman give birth to a child and not realize that she just gave birth it's not a pretty side but she knows it from that time we all have to have something in our life to point out to and say from that time I did this and I did that but from that time the Lord came and touched me from that time I was a different person Church another thing that I want to mention if your friends don't realize that you've changed it's a big problem if your wife doesn't realize that you changed that's a big problem strangers will come to you and say who are you people that you know will come to you and say what's going on what happened to you that's what happens when you have a new birth that's right it's imp possible to meet with a train and be unchanged that's right it's impossible there's has to be a transformation amen it's impossible for you to come together with the word of God and remain unchanged right when the word of God comes inside you're a totally different person as far as I know even your face changes you look different you smell different you act different why because Christ took control now you're at rest but until then big question mark You're toss about amen now brother bam also in this message why are people so talk about he talks about the both Believers being in church paragraph 106 right they're truly eating the same kind of Mana that's right they've been brought into the camp and there is where in the camp of the field is where the people got the Mana and they're in there and that Mana that they eat is the same Mana that this men eat eats here they both have the same Pastor oh my that's right they both read the same Bible but one constantly say stays true and humble and the other one has got his ups and downs going like this in and out both of them eating the same Mana but one has entered in and the other one is still where out both of them are believers unto eternal life but one is baptized with the Holy Spirit into the kingdom of God and the other one is outside eating the same Mana amen amen and uh brother bam goes into this message and he talks about the Tabernacle that Moses built and I love his comparison he talks about the utter cour the holy place and then he talks about the holies of holies now I want to focus a little bit on the outter Court which is also called the justification that's where everybody gets Justified paragraph 125 now what was the first thing the courts represented justification then they came to the first Altar and the first altar is where they burn the sacrifice and where the Lord met them in there in forgiveness of sins and cleansed them from all their unrighteousness and the burning altar the Brazen altar burn the Beast and the blood from the beast in the course they must absolutely justify people regenerated men and women who has accepted God and got eternal life dwelling in them they must be in the courts paragraph 123 here is the way they come in in the pattern oh I'm a Christian brother bam I've been saved I've been baptized I've enjoyed the blessings of God you're in the outer court but say they I I have my ups and downs my worries my toss my tumbles I wish that I could live a victory life a Victorious Life well we've got to get out of the Court you've got to come in that's right so the outer court is a great start see one thing that I've realized is you can't jump from the outer Court straight into the holy place can't do it there are steps you have to be justified but once you're Justified you can't be happy with that that doesn't last that Mana goes bad it's only good for a little bit and then it gets tail so it's saying you have to enter in now the holy place I want to talk a little bit about that paragraph 155 now what's in there there is seven gold gold golden candlesticks by the holy place and it's giving light the candlesticks are giving light that's the man who quits drinking he quits smoking he quits lying he quits stealing treats his neighbor right good to his wife or her good to her husband the same way men or women the believer has come into a place where he he has quit all his manners meanness which is through the blood with sanctification he is called to a new life and he walks in there he don't have to walk by the light out there he's got a B light he's walking by the Light of the seven golden candlesticks which is burning olive oil and I'm just going to paraphrase the rest what brother benam is talking about he said this is the second part that's right it's a must you have to be Sanctified that's right can you imagine if the priest would have got in the holies of holies without getting into the holies first they would have pulled him out he would have been dead you can't can't do that and I love how brother Benham says it's a better place now you're inside you're not subject to rain wind Sun you quit smoking you could quit drinking that's right but see the first part is you doing it the second part is you doing it let's see what the third part is all about right the holies of holies which is called the baptism of the Holy Spirit that's right now paragraph 116 let's see what brother Brenham talks about here we're getting almost towards the end we're not going to be very long this evening into the holy Place Aaron went once a year that's right the congregation watched him he was dressed right that's right he had to be anointed right he had to walk right blessed be blessed by the Lord dressed right walked right anointed right he had Bell and a pomegranate on His Garment and he walked they played holy holy holy unto the Lord paragraph 117 he taken before him a charger of blood the blood of the Lamb the blood of the atonement and he was anointed with the rose of Sharon and anointing run off his beard Plumb to the hems of his skirt and he was walking into the inter courts in the presence of God when he and when he went behind there the veil fell behind him and he was shut out he was hid from the outer World praise be to God Amen it's not going to be a public show no sir as soon as he gets in there everybody's behind you the world is behind you the pastor's behind you everybody's behind you that's what this message is about a personal revelation I can tell you my Revelation you may understand it you may not understand it but it's my Revelation you have to get your own Revelation amen amen there is a holding Place Abiding Place that we can walk in the presence of God and head from the things of the world you don't hear them no more it's soundproof hallelujah it's soundproof the word is on the the world is on the outside gasping and looking but you're on the inside in the presence of the Eternal everlasting God Amen and men that once walk into to God and the veil drops behind him shutting off the things of the world he is in the presence of God eating the Mana that's right amen now what was in the Holy place the Ark of the Covenant that's right what was in the Ark of the Covenant there were three things the Mana which never went stale the commandment and Aaron's staff Aaron's rod so brother Bram goes in and says does that Mana in the Ark of the Covenant ever goes bad it's always fresh Saints that's what it means to be in the presence of the Lord he feeds you daily with the bread the Mana that never goes bad you see what the rest is all about when you eat the Mana every single day and it's fresh you can't live on the Mana that was way back in the day when they picked it from the desert you can't do you can't live on that you need fresh Mana every single day I love how brother bham explains that and then he says did you ever think of that paragraph 127 they took Aaron's rod and laid Aaron's rod in the presence of the Holy place and when they did in one night's time it budded blossomed and yielded almonds in one night's time think of it in the presence of God church right that's exactly how we were Aaron's Rod was ripped off from an almond tree it died it became dry nothing about him it was just a stick that he used but God turned around took that and overnight in the presence of the God Amen what did he do he brought forth fruit that's exactly how you and I were in the beginning you were in Christ but you got cut off you went about in this world you got dried but what see what he what God did in here is He restored you back to the original that's what you were in the beginning and what did he do a dead stick he picked it up amen and he brought fruit in the presence of the Lord praise be to God paragraph 12 139 when Jesus died at Calvary he ripped the veil from top to bottom to give not only the high priest but to everyone that comes approaching God has a right into the holies of holies I want to read that again because that's very important when Jesus died at Calvary he ripped the veil from top to bottom to give not only the high priest but to everyone that comes approaching God has a right to the holiest of holies amen amen Saints as I come to a close I want to show you how important this message that brother bham preached and and as I told you this message changed my life because for a very long time I thought I had the Holy Spirit but yet I still had Little Falls still had a desire to tell a lie I still had a desire to do things that were not accepted in the the Lord one example that I want to give you and I really don't like to point my own self out but I I don't know of any other example just went to a car wash and um it's it's a little bit complicated you got to put your card in and then there's two when you're done with the washing your car it's a self self-washing car you have to press two buttons well one one of them you have to shut off the pump and then there's another button where you got to press to stop well somebody had forgotten to press the stop so the it was basically stop but it was still running so all you had to do is just turn the knob and you can wash the car for free now here's what one voice said it's only $4 it's not a big deal wash your car real quick and it's all done but the other voice said that's called stealing and as soon as that voice said that it's like something took a hold of my finger and pressed up now if that's not the Holy Spirit then you tell me what it is you see you the holy spirit is what takes a hold of you he changes you he speaks to you sure there's the other voice because remember what brother bam said it's a black dog and a white dog that are fighting but here's the here's the here's the main thing which one are you feeding that's right I love how Brother David said what are you watching on your phone that could feed the black dog is that really what you want before you know it that dog's going to take over that's not what we want Amen in 1963 brother Brenham preached a message token brother Brenham he said he he and he was trying to make everyone understand how important this token is absolutely and that without it there's no Heaven that's exactly right without that token that's it Church the Seven Seals are very important whether we understand them all or we don't understand them all God will reveal it to you yes but here's what brother bam said about the token he said there's no heaven without it that's right that's absolutely right now right after the message token in the evening he preached a a sermon called desperations yes sir and here's what he said about this message that he preached in the morning he said this morning this message to me is the Highlight message of my entire Ministry absolutely right amen that's the truth amen that got me right there in other words this is what I came for that's exactly right if the bride doesn't have the Holy Spirit she won't be raptured no that's right she will not be raptured exactly right now you remember all the virgins were sleeping is that right they were all sleeping but God sent a voice that's right at midnight there was a cry wake up and they all woke up right but they were all ready not all of them were ready May may the Lord help us to be ready amen he said this morning and I'm going to end with this if the musicians can come this morning the message this morning to me was the highlight message of my entire Ministry you see a highlight message of my entire Ministry someday I'll tell you how it came about now I always wondered if you if you ever told it I haven't found it if anybody found it I would love to know about it and I know know that everything has worked for months and months and months up to that one message moving up to come to that place that was the capping off time of it you see the only place where you are complete message believer is when you are shut in with Christ there you will produce the life of a True Believer that the Lord will reveal to you the ministry the mysteries of his word that's right Aaron's rod bued and brought for almonds overnight a dead stick brought fruit forth fruit he brought forth almonds because that's where he was in the beginning so are we dead in our works but once we get shot in with God we bring forth fruits of the spirit because it's not us doing it that's it that's it's the holy spirit amen may the Lord help us as we stand and and I pray that the Lord spoke to you this evening and I am definitely glad that the Lord spoke to Meen because it's one to thing to believe you have the Holy Spirit but it's one thing to have it it's a totally different thing I was deceived I thought I had it Saints I thought I had it but I deceived myself and you know what happened God doesn't push anything upon us no till I got on my knees and I said Lord I've been deceived oh don't let one night go by anymore until I receive the Holy Spirit I got desperate Saint amen this is not the time to play anymore that's right you're only deceiving yourself amen you're only deceiving yourself as a matter of fact the pastor came to me and he said I thought you had it too I deceived him I thought I had it he thought I had it but in reality I didn't have it it's time to get serious it is Saints which dog are you feeding God Wants You for his kingdom but he will not force himself he's a gentle kind and loving father amen he will not push the door in he knocks and the Bible says if if you here and I always wondered why wouldn't we hear why wouldn't we hear him knock at the door and the best example that I can give you is this if you vacuum in your home and somebody comes and knocks on the door will you hear it probably not so the only reason why we maybe we're not hearing him is because we're too busy with other things and we're not paying attention he's there knocking and you know what he wants to do he wants to come in and not only that he wants to come in he wants to have Fellowship see that's all this is all about he wants to have a personal relationship with you and I he wants to ask you what is it that you need what is your need what can I do for you it's a one-on-one conversation you know another thing that I personally didn't like at the Pentecost Souls they believe you're here and God is there and that's it but CH Saints God is with you it doesn't matter what you're in your car God is there talk to him ask Him worship Him have fellowship with him that's what he wants to do he wants to have fellowship may the Lord bless you tonight and I pray that the Lord spoke to your heart and maybe with another occasion I will give you a little bit more of my testimony but praise be to God in all things I pray that the Lord will be with you I would like to sing song 425 and brother Alex please
