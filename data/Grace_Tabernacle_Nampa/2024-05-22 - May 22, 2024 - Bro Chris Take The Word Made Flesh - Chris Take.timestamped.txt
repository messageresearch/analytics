[38:13] witness or we would look like Christ
[38:17] because we have been with him from the
[38:19] beginning now in John 1 verse1 in the
[38:23] beginning was the word and the Word was
[38:25] with God and the word was God who who
[38:31] who was the word with
[38:33] God the same was in the same was in the
[38:36] beginning with God all things were made
[38:39] by him and without him was not anything
[38:41] made that was
[38:43] made in him was life and the life was
[38:46] the light of men and the light shineth
[38:49] in darkness and the Darkness
[38:51] comprehended it not the word
[38:53] comprehended means lay hold of yes dark
[38:57] Darkness can't hold light no it's
[39:00] impossible because darkness is the
[39:01] absence of light so there is no ability
[39:04] in darkness to see the light that's
[39:07] right there is no ability thank you Lord
[39:11] for the light in our
[39:13] lives there was a man sent from God
[39:16] whose name was John the same came for a
[39:19] witness to Bear witness of the light
[39:21] that all men through him might
[39:26] believe no noce we we it the script he
[39:29] talks about the light lower case L but
[39:32] then he says he identifies the light
[39:36] Capital K's L being Christ that all men
[39:39] through him might believe he was not
[39:41] that light but was sent to Bear witness
[39:43] of that light to Bear witness that's
[39:47] right you also shall bear witness
[39:48] because you have been with me from the
[39:51] beginning that was the True Light which
[39:53] lith every man that cometh into the
[39:55] world so therefore there's a false light
[39:57] light there's a True Light cuz he didn't
[39:59] doesn't just say light it's the True
[40:01] Light it's the True Light the devil
[40:04] can't create so he just perverts that's
[40:06] right right the The Great Train Robbery
[40:08] brother Bram talks about that light it
[40:09] was the false light stopped the train he
[40:12] was in the world and the world was made
[40:14] by him and the world knew him
[40:17] not he came unto his own and his own
[40:20] received him not but as many as received
[40:22] him to them gave he power to become the
[40:24] sons of God even to them that believe on
[40:27] his name so you come into contact with
[40:29] the word and you have to receive the
[40:31] word you come into contact with then are
[40:34] you called sons of God which were born
[40:37] not of blood nor of the will of the
[40:39] flesh nor of the will of man say Mom and
[40:41] Dad decided to have me no that was God
[40:44] but of God and the Word was made flesh
[40:47] and dwelt among us and we beheld his
[40:49] glory the glory as of the only begotten
[40:51] of the father full of grace and truth
[40:54] amen one last scripture before your
[40:57] before we pray this evening Matthew
[41:00] 24:35 Heaven and Earth shall pass away
[41:02] but my words shall not pass away
[41:06] Heavenly Father Lord we just pray you'd
[41:08] come tonight Lord and you would you
[41:10] would harness the man father and the
[41:13] flesh would be completely put aside and
[41:15] sacrificed on the altar tonight and that
[41:17] your word would take full control Lord
[41:19] and speak that you would speak to our
[41:21] hearts Lord Jesus father we we love you
[41:24] we love your word we love everything
[41:26] about you serving you you being here in
[41:28] this building Lord to to step aside
[41:31] father and worship you and and and hear
[41:34] you hear about you Lord hear you more
[41:36] than just words on the lips but
[41:38] revelation of you Lord may you open
[41:41] yourself to us tonight may we may our
[41:43] eyes see more of you Lord may we go a
[41:46] step further into you Lord and realize
[41:48] who you are to see that reflection of
[41:51] Christ in our own lives we pray we love
[41:53] you Lord and we thank you in Jesus
[41:55] Christ's name amen you may have your
[41:57] seats this
[42:00] evening so I want to speak tonight uh my
[42:03] title is the word made
[42:08] flesh and I want to I want
[42:12] to so I want to open with this quote
[42:16] here and I was reading
[42:18] this last night and I just I had to tell
[42:21] my wife you know brother talks about how
[42:23] he was out there and he was sitting
[42:25] under that tree
[42:27] and I haven't read the story in so long
[42:29] I don't remember exactly what happened
[42:31] but something in the word quickened to
[42:32] him and he ran around that
[42:35] tree when when you read the word of God
[42:38] and something quickens to you maybe
[42:40] something you've heard something you
[42:41] know but it just you see it again in a
[42:44] new light more of himself poured out to
[42:48] you and you read something you you you
[42:50] you read it before you understand it but
[42:52] it just hits you because of of where
[42:55] your thoughts are where your life is
[42:56] where you're reading in the scriptures
[42:58] and and uh you know we think we just get
[43:01] up and we open our Bible and we decide
[43:03] to read the scripture we think we think
[43:05] that but actually the Lord leads us
[43:07] right to where we need to read and we
[43:09] read and and it matches with the sermon
[43:11] we just listened to and everything just
[43:14] goes until the point where you feel like
[43:16] you can hardly contain yourself and and
[43:19] that's that's where emotion just just
[43:23] comes right in line with the word of God
[43:26] in this quote in the comforter he says
[43:28] then what is the word of God what is our
[43:31] comfort today now he's not reading it
[43:33] calmly like I am he is excited when he
[43:36] raises you can go back and listen to it
[43:38] but he says what is our comfort today
[43:39] it's when we receive the baptism of the
[43:41] Holy Ghost and the power of the Living
[43:43] God living in us so God living in us
[43:47] that's our comforter that's why he had
[43:49] to come and die on the cross so that he
[43:51] could come back and pour himself into us
[43:54] right he had to have that access point
[43:57] point right he had to he had to knock
[43:59] that wall down he had to bridge that Gap
[44:01] so he could live in us because it has to
[44:03] be God living in us we have to be to
[44:06] that place so he says with the word of
[44:07] the Living God we stand so the word in
[44:10] us that word is made flesh and dwelt
[44:13] Among Us now the same word that was made
[44:15] flesh and dwelt dwelt Among Us has
[44:18] become our flesh amen so the word made
[44:22] flesh is our title tonight so hopefully
[44:24] you don't leave that title back there
[44:26] for Jesus on the shores of Galilee but
[44:28] you realize that you are the word made
[44:30] flesh and so he says he says the word
[44:34] okay that made flesh and dwelt Among Us
[44:36] has become our flesh you see because how
[44:40] has it become our flesh because as soon
[44:41] as you came into existence your God's
[44:44] word was now walking in flesh amen
[44:48] because
[44:50] because you shall bear witness because
[44:52] you have been with me from the beginning
[44:54] he he says look the Holy Ghost is coming
[44:57] coming back even the spirit of Truth
[44:58] which proceedeth from the father he
[45:00] shall tell be testify of me and then he
[45:04] says and you shall bear witness why
[45:05] because Christ Living in you and you
[45:08] were with him from the beginning so when
[45:11] when you came and you were born which
[45:13] was not of the will of man nor of the
[45:14] will of Flesh you know even people say
[45:17] you know we we we have there's many sons
[45:19] of God in the world today who came by
[45:21] premarital sex but it wasn't it wasn't
[45:24] that wasn't a desire of the flesh even
[45:26] though you could say it it was right but
[45:28] it was God's hand I I'm not here to
[45:32] explain why but that's what happens it's
[45:34] God's hand so you became flesh now what
[45:37] happens was was when you were born and
[45:39] you came out out and you were there and
[45:42] maybe you grew up in the world that you
[45:44] were you were sinful you were you were
[45:46] acting the flesh because you didn't know
[45:49] who you
[45:50] were as soon as you realized who you
[45:53] were now the word begins to act through
[45:56] your flesh because your flesh becomes
[45:58] subject to the word of God so you so God
[46:01] says looks out he says there's my My
[46:04] Flesh again so he is with you now but he
[46:07] shall be in you now that same word that
[46:11] the prophet spoke that same word that
[46:13] was made flesh that same word that
[46:15] dwells in the
[46:16] church so the word is dwelling in the
[46:19] church dwelling in the bride of
[46:22] Christ you see the bride is the word
[46:24] made flesh amen not every body is is
[46:27] there
[46:30] yet we preach to the group God deals
[46:34] with the individual that's right so we
[46:38] have to let the Lord guide you because
[46:42] we look at ourselves in the mirror and
[46:44] we say well that ain't that ain't right
[46:46] it's God like leading you God guiding
[46:48] you God opening the the desires of of
[46:52] your of his word in your
[46:54] life but we preached to the group and
[46:56] God deals with the
[46:58] individual I think well that's something
[47:02] else so we'll get back to the quote here
[47:04] he says now the the same word that the
[47:06] prophet spoke that same word that was
[47:07] made flesh that same word dwells in the
[47:09] church therefore if we don't compromise
[47:11] that word we stay right with it if we
[47:13] don't compromise it that same word
[47:15] living in you will produce the same
[47:18] thing that it did when it was made flesh
[47:21] because your flesh holds it so you want
[47:23] to you want to read about what you're
[47:25] going to do you can read the
[47:28] gospels that's right
[47:30] but and God you say well brother I know
[47:35] people who go to church who don't act
[47:36] like
[47:37] that see God bring God's bringing them
[47:41] along because you look at them and then
[47:44] you look at yourself in the mirror right
[47:45] I mean we all have our we all have the
[47:48] our shortcomings where we need to grow
[47:50] further in Christ because the word how
[47:54] do you how do we say this the word will
[47:56] bring forth
[47:58] the word that's right so the word in you
[48:01] you you you see why you see why you need
[48:04] the word because you you are the word
[48:08] okay so word feeds word did you know
[48:11] that a lamb can only marry a lamb that's
[48:13] right the two shall become one why is it
[48:17] why is it that he says okay let's finish
[48:19] because there's this great spot in this
[48:24] quote that's the reason Vision the the
[48:27] same quote can break through the sound
[48:28] barrier that's the reason a vision can
[48:29] break through time barriers and say thus
[48:31] say the Lord it shall be so and so and
[48:33] that's the way it is what is it it's the
[48:35] word coming forth from a spirit
[48:38] amen next quote he says you do not see
[48:42] me you see my body you don't see me I
[48:46] don't see you because I only see your
[48:49] body this is my hand but who is me that
[48:53] owns the hand this is my body but who is
[48:56] me it's a spirit and if I'm born again
[49:00] if you are born again it's God's holy
[49:03] spirit God's word living in us see this
[49:07] is kind of part two from last Wednesday
[49:09] you see you're not looking at this isn't
[49:11] me the real me is inside it's Jesus
[49:15] Christ the word of God so when I look at
[49:19] you I'm seeing the flesh I I can't see
[49:22] who you I can't really see you because
[49:24] the word is living in you but then you
[49:26] will do something you'll act something
[49:29] and we'll say wow he looks just like his
[49:32] dad if you are born again it's God's
[49:35] holy spirit God's word living in us and
[49:37] if we compromise upon this word and say
[49:40] that we have the spirit of God how can
[49:42] we claim to have God's spirit when God's
[49:44] spirit testifies of his own word right
[49:48] so he'll never move an inch from it no
[49:50] matter what denomination says how is he
[49:53] going to move from it when it's his own
[49:56] word yes so how are you go back don't
[50:00] jump ahead yet how are you going to move
[50:02] from the word when you are the
[50:05] word that's that's why it's it's
[50:08] Revelation Faith cometh by hearing the
[50:11] word of God well you just listen to a
[50:12] sermon and suddenly you have faith no
[50:14] it's revelation of the word of God he
[50:16] that hath an ear let him hear what the
[50:19] spirit of God is saying to the churches
[50:21] so we have the word of God we have the
[50:24] spirit of God speaking to us today and
[50:28] it's testifying of the word that is
[50:30] within us and when we see that's what
[50:32] Revelation is is when you you Revelation
[50:35] is when you see the word in you right
[50:38] you say well no brother Chris no I I I
[50:40] understood it yeah you understood it
[50:42] because you saw you in the word of God
[50:44] you read it and something inside of you
[50:46] said I accept that why did you accept it
[50:49] because it was his own word amen you
[50:53] read the word of God what that's brother
[50:55] says the Deep calleth to to the deep and
[50:57] there's the Deep to respond what is it
[50:59] the word calling to the word and there's
[51:01] a word to respond so Revelation that is
[51:05] why when you have a revelation of the
[51:07] word of God it's not intellectual it's
[51:10] down deep inside of you because why now
[51:13] it's like a book right it's the seals
[51:14] within you being opened that's what it
[51:16] is that's right and and some some of
[51:18] it's still sealed up for us but as we
[51:21] progress God's word is open before us
[51:24] and we can unlock those things those
[51:26] hidden mysteries in our own lives and we
[51:29] can see God's word because once you see
[51:31] the book open in your life you can't
[51:34] unsee it that's right because it's you
[51:37] amen it's who you are Alex cannot stop
[51:41] being Alex that's
[51:44] right take that either way you want love
[51:47] you no you can't stop being that's why
[51:50] you see you just you can't you read the
[51:53] Bible and
[51:57] I already said it you cannot see it okay
[52:00] and that's why it's so important because
[52:02] that's what anchors you amen it's
[52:05] Anchored In what the hidden Mana why why
[52:08] is it Brother David said on Sunday why
[52:10] is it anchored behind the veil because
[52:12] that's the hidden Mana that's the place
[52:14] nobody can go to nobody can go to this
[52:17] place only you can that's right and only
[52:21] you can go to that place in you you
[52:23] can't go to that place in your pastor
[52:25] you can't go to that place in your
[52:27] brother or your sister you or your
[52:28] parents you have to go to that place in
[52:31] you because only
[52:33] you you the word of Christ inside of you
[52:36] is the only word you can catch a
[52:38] revelation of you see if if if God knows
[52:42] you and you know God the devil knows who
[52:44] you are so therefore what power does
[52:48] that give you you say oh my goodness now
[52:49] the devil knows who I am I have a Target
[52:51] on my back no no no don't look at it
[52:52] like that look at it is as you are the
[52:55] sons of God around the throne there's
[52:58] you there and you
[53:01] here so how can you do anything besides
[53:05] what the word is doing in your life he
[53:06] say well I have lots of mistakes have
[53:08] you corrected them yes there you have it
[53:12] flesh subjected to the word of God Amen
[53:15] there's a season there's a time we go
[53:17] and we do it and we say oh my goodness
[53:18] Lord forgive
[53:20] me then you move on you
[53:25] know you move on because the word the
[53:27] word moves on the word moves forward so
[53:30] you say well well God turned a corner oh
[53:33] my goodness God turned a corner I got to
[53:34] make sure I catch the corner no just
[53:36] make sure you have the word that's right
[53:38] make sure you have access to the word
[53:40] that's inside of you make sure that the
[53:43] the word because you see God said in
[53:46] Matthew excuse me in John he said you've
[53:50] been with me from the
[53:52] beginning
[53:54] so while we were yet sinners Christ died
[53:56] for us why why would he do that why
[54:00] would he die for you while you were
[54:01] still a sinner while you were no
[54:03] different than the man who beat him and
[54:04] spit in his face you were no different
[54:06] than that man why would he die for you
[54:09] while you were yet a sinner because
[54:10] you're the word amen amen so when he
[54:13] died he died for the word that was with
[54:16] him in the beginning that's why so that
[54:18] now you have access to that part of
[54:22] you that was always
[54:24] there brother the B says I rose with
[54:30] Christ he pretty much goes through the
[54:32] entire Bible I mean you talking about
[54:34] this part I wanted to read the whole
[54:35] quote but that that just not you go home
[54:38] and listen to it but he says he says I
[54:40] was with Joshua when he stood there
[54:41] looking at the walls of
[54:43] Jericho he says I had to be there
[54:46] because I'm the word amen I was there
[54:49] when when we were there when Enoch
[54:51] stepped from this world to the next
[54:53] because we're the
[54:54] word me and you were there when when
[54:57] when Christ spoke to the Pharisees and
[55:01] said how can a house divided against
[55:04] itself stand we say well there's
[55:07] opposition I'm being persecuted you were
[55:08] already there you've already done it
[55:10] that's right you've already stood
[55:12] against the persecution you were with
[55:13] Paul and and Peter and them when they
[55:16] had to hide and sneak over the wall you
[55:18] were there why because you were the word
[55:19] and Paul's the
[55:21] word you see the
[55:24] word testifying of the the word amen
[55:28] that's right there's nothing you can do
[55:30] it's your lineage amen it's who you are
[55:34] sorry before you before you ever had a
[55:36] choice God chose you you didn't choose
[55:38] God why is that true because in the
[55:40] beginning you were with God Amen logos
[55:44] that's it says the logos went out from
[55:47] God right it went out from God and the
[55:49] world was created and there was there
[55:52] was Spirit man why did why would there
[55:54] Spirit man because God's a spirit so
[55:56] there had to be a spirit man and then he
[55:57] made man in the of the dust made he made
[56:01] man in the image of himself which was
[56:03] Spirit man then he this is right in the
[56:05] message you can go read it then he made
[56:06] him the man of the dust that's right so
[56:10] therefore who's the real man the man of
[56:12] the dust or the man of The Spirit Well
[56:14] which one's in the image of God the man
[56:15] of the spirit that's right that's why we
[56:18] don't look for God in flesh you say the
[56:20] word made flesh you just contradicted
[56:22] yourself no no no no no this isn't this
[56:24] isn't it the word here the this vessel
[56:27] is carrying around the word of God so
[56:30] when we speak how do we speak Mountain
[56:32] worlds into existence how do we speak to
[56:34] mountains and make them move if we're
[56:35] just flesh man born in sin Shi and
[56:37] iniquity come into the world speaking
[56:38] lies because we're
[56:41] not we're the word we are the word today
[56:45] oh where's God we need a Revival we need
[56:48] a Revival denominations and everything
[56:50] and even some message you know we need a
[56:52] mass Revival or whatever I didn't mean
[56:54] that in a derogatory way in m survival
[56:57] no that's not what it is we just we we
[56:59] need the word of God
[57:01] because well I lost my train of thought
[57:03] so maybe the Lord has a different
[57:04] direction so the word of God made flesh
[57:07] in you and me am That's Where It's At
[57:09] that's right that's that's right where
[57:11] you know you just hear Brother brandom
[57:13] Minister and you know I'm in 65 right
[57:16] now you can you can hear he just he
[57:19] wants them to get it so bad am he wants
[57:22] them to get it so bad and it just wasn't
[57:25] them it was for
[57:28] us it was for us but the word had to
[57:30] come through the prophet that's right
[57:32] exactly right you see God's not limited
[57:34] by time he recorded the prophet's voice
[57:36] amen see you can't you know God is is
[57:40] perfect always
[57:43] perfect so he says he says and how is he
[57:46] going to move from it when it's his own
[57:48] word
[57:50] right amen
[57:57] so in in this this next quote it's
[58:00] actually in the comforter as
[58:02] well he says he's talking
[58:08] about coming into contact with the word
[58:11] now something just it's just you know
[58:13] this will just get you all fired up you
[58:14] read this they saw him stop the woman of
[58:17] n come down there when the funeral
[58:18] procession and her only son a corpse
[58:20] embalmed going to the grave but that
[58:22] corpse came in contact with the word
[58:25] though a corpse yet did he live though
[58:26] he were dead yet shall he live a corpse
[58:28] came to life because it come in contact
[58:30] with the word oh what will it do when it
[58:32] when it when in contact with that word
[58:35] that's a comfort that's it so praise God
[58:38] we were a corpse we came in contact with
[58:40] the word but the thing of it is is that
[58:41] you have to remember people say well I
[58:43] came in contact with the word and
[58:44] nothing H nothing changed me the contact
[58:47] with the word has to be received he says
[58:51] he says you
[58:54] shall wait nope we're in John this is
[58:56] where it is he came unto his own and his
[58:58] own received him not every Man was
[59:02] created by God Amen so you say his own
[59:05] well I thought we were his own no he's
[59:07] referring to Creation they couldn't
[59:08] receive him they couldn't receive him
[59:10] why couldn't they receive him they came
[59:12] into contact with him I mean the
[59:13] Pharisees you know the man brother uses
[59:16] this example all the time the man that
[59:18] smacked him in the face never felt no
[59:19] virtue he was in contact with the word
[59:22] he was in contact with the word the
[59:24] Pharisees were in Fellowship if you
[59:26] could say this well Fellowship you have
[59:28] to be in agreement but they were in
[59:29] conversation with the word he says oh if
[59:32] I could you say oh if I could just get
[59:33] to the word if I could just be in the
[59:35] word if I could just hear the word of
[59:36] God and you do and why don't you get
[59:38] Victory because you don't receive it you
[59:41] say oh that's that preacher's idea
[59:43] that's his opinion that's I I think
[59:46] that's the greatest fallacy we have as
[59:48] human beings is when God anoints a man
[59:49] to minister and and and the word come
[59:52] forth and we hear it and it's something
[59:54] we need and it's something that touches
[59:55] us but we aren't ready to receive it we
[59:58] say it's his
[1:00:01] words but it's not that's why you make
[1:00:04] sure the men that are behind the pulpit
[1:00:06] in your church are called anointed of
[1:00:08] God that's the point so then if they are
[1:00:10] and if if you're going to say that when
[1:00:12] we preach you into into
[1:00:15] heaven then you have to receive it when
[1:00:17] you preach your flesh into
[1:00:19] hell not in a angry way or damning way
[1:00:23] but I I deal with that I hear the word I
[1:00:26] say well that's just his idea then the
[1:00:29] Lord checks me he says well is either
[1:00:31] it's me or or it's not me and if it's
[1:00:33] not me why are you sitting
[1:00:35] here and that's the biggest thing saying
[1:00:37] to God we hear the word and we don't
[1:00:38] receive it why because we're not ready
[1:00:40] to receive it but it's not just con the
[1:00:43] point I'm making is it not just contact
[1:00:46] with the word she had Faith that's she
[1:00:50] had the faith Revelation she knew she
[1:00:54] she she's there mourning all of sudden
[1:00:56] she looks up and she says that's the
[1:00:58] word amen and that's why he lived this
[1:01:01] corpse who's not a corpse anymore he's
[1:01:04] alive
[1:01:07] breathing because he received the word
[1:01:10] was
[1:01:12] received so the Pharisees and the
[1:01:14] Sadducees they conversed with the word
[1:01:15] but they didn't receive the word they
[1:01:17] the light was there
[1:01:19] but they couldn't receive it because
[1:01:21] they were Darkness Darkness can't lay a
[1:01:23] hold of the light Darkness can't
[1:01:24] comprehend it that that's why you you
[1:01:26] you can't that's why you cannot explain
[1:01:28] the word of God because if you could
[1:01:30] explain the word of God then Darkness
[1:01:31] could hold on to light but Darkness
[1:01:33] can't hold on to light you turn off the
[1:01:35] lights here right now and you know it's
[1:01:38] going to be dark well sort of dark but
[1:01:40] somewhat darker and then you you try to
[1:01:43] hand Darkness the light Darkness
[1:01:44] disappears that's why the Devil comes to
[1:01:46] you just hand him the word that's right
[1:01:48] don't hand him your own you know don't
[1:01:53] hand him your thing your stuff you say
[1:01:55] well I'm going to put my foot on the
[1:01:56] enemy's neck do you know how you put
[1:01:58] your foot on the en on the enemy's neck
[1:02:00] you speak the word it's not that you
[1:02:02] physically put your foot on his neck no
[1:02:05] you speak the word that's right so the
[1:02:08] word says when the Devil Comes resist
[1:02:10] him and he will
[1:02:14] flee it's word resisting the darkness
[1:02:20] it's light turning on that's what it is
[1:02:23] the darkness comes to tempt you turn the
[1:02:25] light on
[1:02:27] brother man preached a simple sermon yet
[1:02:29] so profound there's a man he that can
[1:02:30] turn on the light that's right says oh
[1:02:33] little girl says I'm scared I'm scared
[1:02:34] it's super Darkness don't worry there's
[1:02:35] someone who can turn the light
[1:02:37] on ask and you shall receive the Bible
[1:02:40] says so when light turns on there's no
[1:02:42] more Darkness there's no more fear
[1:02:44] that's right but you have to have the
[1:02:46] Revelation to turn on the
[1:02:49] switch you know if I turn the switch
[1:02:52] line into my house nothing happens I'm
[1:02:53] going to the control
[1:02:54] board say look what's wrong there's a
[1:02:56] fuse you know fuse there's a breaker
[1:02:59] blown I need to fix this and if that
[1:03:01] doesn't go then I I go hunting down and
[1:03:02] I say okay Idaho Power why don't I have
[1:03:04] power as though there's an outage in
[1:03:06] your area and we're we're working on it
[1:03:08] we're fixing it what is seek and ye
[1:03:10] shall find the answer that's right
[1:03:13] something's not working a promise to of
[1:03:15] God is not coming to pass in your life
[1:03:17] don't just give up that's right go
[1:03:20] figure out why the light won't turn on
[1:03:23] and many times it comes back around and
[1:03:25] it's a god saying look I need you to be
[1:03:27] more perseverant he gives you the faith
[1:03:29] and he tests your faith so the light
[1:03:32] won't come on I know people and I and I
[1:03:35] and I sat there and I had a conversation
[1:03:36] with them and they told me I tried it
[1:03:38] and it didn't
[1:03:42] work and I I I I was there and In the
[1:03:44] Flesh I I was said you know what I can
[1:03:46] see why you say
[1:03:48] that you did
[1:03:52] try but you stopped short because the
[1:03:56] the word of God says give me
[1:03:59] everything everything I want everything
[1:04:02] why because the flesh has to die we had
[1:04:05] to die we we if we're going to be the
[1:04:08] word of God we were if we were going to
[1:04:09] be with God when he died on the cross we
[1:04:12] had to die too our flesh had to die amen
[1:04:17] it had to be buried to raise again what
[1:04:21] not this flesh but now raise again in
[1:04:24] Christ what happens our flesh is in
[1:04:27] control that's right of the word of God
[1:04:29] within
[1:04:30] us so he says oh it didn't work that's
[1:04:33] because you didn't give it enough
[1:04:35] time you didn't give it enough Faith
[1:04:39] because when people say it doesn't work
[1:04:40] and they walk away what they're saying
[1:04:42] is that I don't want
[1:04:44] to I don't want to so now you're not
[1:04:46] you're here you're serving God you got
[1:04:48] the Holy Ghost but there's something in
[1:04:49] your life that you need from God this is
[1:04:51] something you really need don't stop he
[1:04:55] told the woman this saraph phenician
[1:04:57] woman he ignored
[1:04:59] her he ignored her she turned the light
[1:05:02] switch and nothing
[1:05:04] happened so she went to the breakers she
[1:05:07] says she continued to say Lord
[1:05:11] please and at the breaker box there was
[1:05:13] no power he turned around and says look
[1:05:16] I'm not going to give to you was the
[1:05:18] children's bread be given to the dogs so
[1:05:20] she called the power company she says
[1:05:22] but Lord I can eat the crumbs off the
[1:05:25] table God says your daughter's healed
[1:05:28] why he was testing her faith he knew who
[1:05:30] she was he knew her faith but he tested
[1:05:32] it why because he's God cuz he's God and
[1:05:37] if he tests your faith guess what you're
[1:05:39] that much
[1:05:40] stronger why are you that much stronger
[1:05:42] because you have that much more
[1:05:43] revelation of the word that's within you
[1:05:45] yes sir you see there's nothing lacking
[1:05:48] the the the power of Christ is within us
[1:05:50] what lack is our faith to use that power
[1:05:54] and I think sometimes the reason we lack
[1:05:56] the faith is because we don't understand
[1:05:58] what God's trying to say and we're
[1:06:00] trying to physically put our foot on the
[1:06:02] neck of the enemy you stand you stomp
[1:06:04] the floor and you say well I putting you
[1:06:06] under my feet that doesn't do anything
[1:06:08] the word of God puts the devil down am
[1:06:12] that's why the that's why the atmosphere
[1:06:14] changes when you put on a sermon it's
[1:06:17] the word of God being
[1:06:18] spoken that's why your atmosphere
[1:06:21] changes when you read your Bible right
[1:06:24] or put on a song
[1:06:26] what is it it's the word that's why it's
[1:06:28] important what music you listen to
[1:06:29] because it's got to be the word if it's
[1:06:31] not the word then it's not going to do
[1:06:33] anything for you but the word because
[1:06:37] you're the word because you you look at
[1:06:39] the word you say how can they eat all
[1:06:40] that junk food and still survive they're
[1:06:43] not the
[1:06:44] word you're the word so you can't go out
[1:06:46] there you can't eat that stuff and
[1:06:49] survive you know your life will just be
[1:06:51] in
[1:06:52] shambles you look at your neighbor and
[1:06:54] says man he he done and he you know he
[1:06:57] uses the lord's name in vain and
[1:06:58] everything else and look at him he's
[1:06:59] thriving got his business and all that
[1:07:01] kind of stuff and making the money and
[1:07:03] living the life and he's got the boat
[1:07:05] and and everything he he could imagine
[1:07:08] and and he lives his entire life that
[1:07:10] way smokes like a chimney and dies at
[1:07:13] 95 but what what that doesn't
[1:07:16] matter that doesn't matter who wants who
[1:07:18] wants to live like that anyways but you
[1:07:21] see but the it's because you can't do
[1:07:23] that because you're the word
[1:07:26] amen so as soon as you this is where it
[1:07:28] just frustrates me frustrates me I get
[1:07:31] righteous righteous indignation when I
[1:07:33] see people and I say I know you're a
[1:07:35] child of
[1:07:36] God and that's why your life's terrible
[1:07:40] in the world and you just want to say
[1:07:43] why don't you just come to
[1:07:44] church you you everything you want you
[1:07:47] can't get because God won't let you
[1:07:49] because you're the word that's you say
[1:07:52] while I was get sinners Christ died for
[1:07:53] you so you were the word that's that's
[1:07:55] why you couldn't make it it just oh my
[1:07:57] goodness you just it wouldn't work you
[1:07:59] tried to leave church you tried to give
[1:08:00] up on church and it just wouldn't work
[1:08:04] God made your life
[1:08:05] miserable why because you're the word
[1:08:08] the word needs
[1:08:12] word in the beginning was the word the
[1:08:13] word is with God and the Word was
[1:08:16] God the word needs the
[1:08:19] word in Christ is the mystery of God
[1:08:22] revealed he says that's in Christ the
[1:08:25] word word he was the word he is the
[1:08:28] word and the church becomes the word by
[1:08:32] him making her a part of him that's the
[1:08:36] word again amen it's the word again and
[1:08:40] again
[1:08:41] Loos you know we we the word the
[1:08:46] English this is going to sound the the
[1:08:48] word in English for word is overused
[1:08:52] because it's part of our language logos
[1:08:55] though for us we're not Greek right so
[1:08:56] we hear the word
[1:08:58] logos for me it resonates deeper because
[1:09:01] the meaning is deeper the logos you go
[1:09:04] in the in the Bible and you look up what
[1:09:06] that is and where that goes through in
[1:09:07] the scriptures it's more than just a
[1:09:09] word spoken by a man that's right it is
[1:09:13] the deity of Jesus Christ in the
[1:09:16] beginning was the logos and the logos
[1:09:18] was with God and the logos was God so
[1:09:21] now that means logos has logos to impart
[1:09:25] because the Lo ghost was with God that's
[1:09:28] right so God has more God in the
[1:09:30] beginning all of us were with God we
[1:09:33] were there with God because it just says
[1:09:35] right here the word was with God are you
[1:09:37] the word were you with God John said the
[1:09:39] word is with God so you were there with
[1:09:42] God that's why you're going back to
[1:09:44] where you came from that's right why did
[1:09:46] you have to come down here because you
[1:09:47] need character to handle the
[1:09:49] word the word God has given you you need
[1:09:53] the character to handle it oh God Jesus
[1:09:56] can't we just call fire down upon them
[1:09:58] what if they had all the word in
[1:09:59] Perfection they would have called fire
[1:10:00] down upon them no character that's right
[1:10:03] but you're going to be a
[1:10:05] ruler you're going to rule so you need
[1:10:07] character to handle the word of God you
[1:10:09] have all of the power but God keeps you
[1:10:12] from accessing all the power because of
[1:10:14] your faith and your faith is perfected
[1:10:16] in
[1:10:17] what your suffering amen your character
[1:10:21] guess what this is going to be this is
[1:10:22] going to blow your mind Jesus wasn't
[1:10:24] ready for the Cru CR fiction at age
[1:10:26] 30
[1:10:28] y because you were in him y he needed
[1:10:32] Perfection you say well he was perfect
[1:10:35] he had to walk that road that's right he
[1:10:37] had to come through that Ministry to get
[1:10:40] to that position because he had to know
[1:10:43] what it feels like to be you that's
[1:10:44] right why so his word could change you
[1:10:49] he needed to know he needed to be your
[1:10:52] kinsman redeemer he needed to have
[1:10:54] access he needed to walk in flesh and
[1:10:57] show you you can be all God and all man
[1:11:01] that's right you can be all Brother
[1:11:04] David but all Christ that's right you
[1:11:06] can be all Aaliyah but all Christ EXA
[1:11:09] right each one of you y so when you're
[1:11:13] lacking it's not that you don't have the
[1:11:15] word you're lacking access to the word
[1:11:17] you have y so you say God give me more
[1:11:21] faith give me more Revelation Lord show
[1:11:24] me more about yourself what does that do
[1:11:27] why is that so important he says oh it's
[1:11:29] just it's just something I Now
[1:11:30] understand about the Bible no it's
[1:11:32] something you know have a revelation of
[1:11:34] you and when you have a
[1:11:36] revelation when you have a revelation of
[1:11:38] you guess what victory you're going to
[1:11:41] have that's why we need it it's not
[1:11:43] about knowledge and be able to explain
[1:11:45] it that comes with it because you're
[1:11:48] going to talk about it you're going to
[1:11:49] Fellowship about it but what it does is
[1:11:51] it gives it victory in your life amen it
[1:11:53] says why do I need to know why this
[1:11:55] seals are open because it's Revelation
[1:11:56] for greater Victory amen because your
[1:12:00] Revelation he overcame him by the blood
[1:12:02] of the lamb and the word of your
[1:12:05] testimony your testifying of Christ and
[1:12:09] if you need all Christ to overcome all
[1:12:11] of the enemy then you need to understand
[1:12:14] and have a revelation of all of Christ
[1:12:16] to be able to
[1:12:18] testify see testimony we're not talking
[1:12:20] about just what oh the other day I was
[1:12:22] driving and then I stopped and there was
[1:12:24] a car that read that's not what that's
[1:12:26] talking about that's talking about
[1:12:28] testimony what it's the word in you
[1:12:30] speaking out saying look this is what
[1:12:33] the SC I was reading the scripture the
[1:12:34] day and it said this and it mean this to
[1:12:36] me what is it it's it's Revelation and
[1:12:39] when that revelation of the word that's
[1:12:40] within you it
[1:12:43] grows then she will be an invincible
[1:12:46] Army so you need to know you need to
[1:12:48] listen to the tapes 47- 65 read the
[1:12:52] Bible you need that you need God to give
[1:12:55] you revelation of it don't read it like
[1:12:57] a
[1:12:59] newspaper don't read it like a newspaper
[1:13:02] brother says youve got to know your
[1:13:04] ABCs before you can know
[1:13:06] algebra in other words you have to know
[1:13:09] God keeps his word Before He'll reveal
[1:13:11] to you more of who you are more of who
[1:13:14] you are because he's showing himself to
[1:13:15] you and you are
[1:13:17] recognizing your position in
[1:13:20] Christ he was the word he is the word
[1:13:22] and the church becomes a word by him
[1:13:24] making her a part of him and that's the
[1:13:26] word again right see word begot word
[1:13:30] personally identified by him his
[1:13:33] property alone amen property
[1:13:39] of property of Jesus Christ I am a
[1:13:42] prisoner to Christ that's right that's
[1:13:44] what Paul was talking about
[1:13:48] prisoner a prisoner can only do what the
[1:13:51] warden says he can
[1:13:52] do that's right and he can only go as
[1:13:56] far as the warden says he can that's
[1:13:59] right and he can go outside when the
[1:14:01] warden says he can he says oh my
[1:14:03] goodness that sounds like
[1:14:05] prison
[1:14:07] right but you
[1:14:09] see it's the best place you could ever
[1:14:11] be
[1:14:13] amen C Paul was making a
[1:14:17] point and it's not it's not the
[1:14:20] it's you're
[1:14:22] harnessed you're harnessed by Christ
[1:14:25] that's right because you're harnessed
[1:14:27] because you can't move an inch from the
[1:14:29] word if you're the
[1:14:30] word you see I think we've complicated
[1:14:33] it too much and I mean at least I know I
[1:14:36] did we're going out and we're we're
[1:14:38] trying to get you know someone told me
[1:14:40] one time well how do you get Faith and I
[1:14:42] well Faith kind of gets you actually
[1:14:45] that's right see we're trying to get
[1:14:48] Faith and you know it's almost like
[1:14:51] forgive me for this example but it's
[1:14:52] almost like you know you're you're
[1:14:53] trying to to be be a a a Jedi master and
[1:14:57] focus and move something across the room
[1:14:59] or whatever like think that's in Star
[1:15:02] Wars
[1:15:03] right Focus your energy on something and
[1:15:05] move it that's not how it is it's not
[1:15:08] magic no it's not
[1:15:11] magic it's you it's the word within you
[1:15:14] pushing out that's right and so if you
[1:15:17] want the word to push out your cup
[1:15:19] overfloweth you want your cup to
[1:15:21] overflow you want the iniquity to go out
[1:15:25] fill up the
[1:15:26] cup fill it up feed the word that's
[1:15:29] within you because the word within you
[1:15:31] has to be fed otherwise the flesh starts
[1:15:34] to take control that's
[1:15:40] right
[1:15:43] so he says word again personally
[1:15:45] identified by him his property alone she
[1:15:49] is Redeemed by him through him for him
[1:15:51] and for him alone amen that's right
[1:15:55] then what the devil is howling
[1:15:59] about that's I'll rephrase it for for
[1:16:02] him because this is what
[1:16:06] he that's why the devil's howling right
[1:16:10] because it's being revealed to you
[1:16:13] that's why the devil is howling that's
[1:16:15] why the world is trying so hard to
[1:16:17] distract you that's right because you're
[1:16:21] he's it's being revealed to you amen
[1:16:23] it's being revealed amen it's being
[1:16:26] revealed I am Jesus Christ is same
[1:16:28] yesterday today and forever I am that I
[1:16:30] am always present always present right
[1:16:34] look at the natural people you know
[1:16:36] natural we just want to be present you
[1:16:37] know in in companies and everything we
[1:16:39] present in the moment live in the moment
[1:16:41] be present right I just want to be you
[1:16:43] know a CEO I want to be
[1:16:45] present that's the natural type in the
[1:16:47] spiritual amen present God not the god
[1:16:50] of the past not even the god of the
[1:16:52] future right now because if you get the
[1:16:55] god present guess what you'll get the
[1:16:57] god of the future and you'll get the god
[1:17:00] of the past that's right because you
[1:17:02] have God Amen God is outside of time
[1:17:06] that's right so we don't have to go back
[1:17:08] to get God and we don't have to wait to
[1:17:10] get God he's always because he's not
[1:17:13] part of
[1:17:14] time therefore how in the world can
[1:17:17] eternity dwell within you a finite body
[1:17:21] the Paradox of a son of God
[1:17:25] you see why the world looks on it says
[1:17:26] you have lost your mind yes I have and I
[1:17:29] taken on the mind of
[1:17:32] Christ you can't even think like a human
[1:17:35] anymore you got to think like Christ
[1:17:38] amen Christ is outside of time so
[1:17:40] therefore you have to think beyond the
[1:17:42] limitations of time and realize it
[1:17:45] doesn't matter time does not matter you
[1:17:48] say brother Chris really amen here in a
[1:17:51] few hours I'm going to have to go to bed
[1:17:52] because time says so but that's not the
[1:17:55] real you that's
[1:17:57] it that's the person you have to put up
[1:18:00] with till you can be the real you in
[1:18:03] flesh so you can be the real you when
[1:18:07] your theophany comes and you meet face
[1:18:09] to face guess what that's your
[1:18:10] transition across time
[1:18:13] poof now you're no longer part of time
[1:18:16] you see you contain the potential to be
[1:18:19] Eternal that's right you have the
[1:18:21] potential to be everything word
[1:18:26] is and your access to that is revelation
[1:18:31] amen is hearing the word of God Slow
[1:18:36] Down slow down you don't need to read
[1:18:39] five chapters a day if you don't get
[1:18:41] five chapters a day slow down some
[1:18:44] people do sometimes I I say down and I
[1:18:46] read several chapters and I'm it's all
[1:18:47] just flowing together and it's amazing
[1:18:49] sometimes just one because it's access
[1:18:52] to God it's not a checkbox
[1:18:55] stop serving God like it's a check box
[1:18:59] look the Bible says when the house of
[1:19:01] when the doors of the house of God are
[1:19:02] open be there right but don't treat it
[1:19:05] like a checkbox that's right you didn't
[1:19:08] you're not here because you're you're
[1:19:10] supposed to that's right you're here
[1:19:12] because this is what the this is the
[1:19:15] reality we're we we have church service
[1:19:18] twice a week Sunday morning Wednesday
[1:19:20] night sometimes we have Sunday evening
[1:19:22] or
[1:19:23] whatever tce twice a
[1:19:26] week and that's the real part that isn't
[1:19:30] real that is simply an ends to a me
[1:19:33] means to an end end emphasis on end
[1:19:38] thank you Lord that's right and the
[1:19:40] reason that God has to the reason that
[1:19:42] God has to make things
[1:19:45] uncomfortable because he wants to you to
[1:19:47] remember you don't belong here that's
[1:19:51] right so you can you'll have success
[1:19:55] I believe that but it'll never be what
[1:19:58] just what you want it'll never be that
[1:20:03] perfectness until you get in Christ and
[1:20:05] then you realize wow so you get off you
[1:20:09] get off this way a little bit God's
[1:20:11] going to poke you so you go back this
[1:20:13] way to
[1:20:15] him and really what that is is that's
[1:20:18] the word inside of you saying man I'm
[1:20:21] starving because the word needs the word
[1:20:23] it's the word again amen
[1:20:25] amen him him by him making her a part of
[1:20:29] him that's the word again amen again
[1:20:32] exactly again again I Die daily Amen in
[1:20:38] other words I go back to the Cross every
[1:20:41] day because I was in him when he died on
[1:20:44] the cross that's right and I was him in
[1:20:46] him when he rose again so I go back to
[1:20:49] the Cross what is the cross it's not
[1:20:52] what the world has painted it to be
[1:20:56] it is you and him that's
[1:20:59] it bearing the iniquities of your flesh
[1:21:02] and burying them that's right bearing
[1:21:05] the iniquities of your flesh and burying
[1:21:08] them why because the
[1:21:10] word the
[1:21:12] word shoved that old man down into the
[1:21:15] grave and when he rose again that old
[1:21:18] man was subject because Jesus was in one
[1:21:21] place then he
[1:21:22] wasn't he was in a glor body he rose up
[1:21:26] to heaven how come he didn't do that
[1:21:28] before cuz it wasn't glorified body so
[1:21:31] you want to rise up into heaven come
[1:21:33] into more contact with the word of God
[1:21:35] so he says identified by him that okay
[1:21:39] that's what the devil is howling
[1:21:41] about now in the identified Masterpiece
[1:21:44] of God he says I am
[1:21:47] identified with him and his death see I
[1:21:50] referenced this earlier I just took
[1:21:53] a a piece of it I died with him when he
[1:21:56] died at Calvary and I rose again on
[1:21:58] Easter morning with him and in the power
[1:22:00] with him in the power of his
[1:22:02] resurrection so you already have the
[1:22:04] potential to raise
[1:22:07] again I'm talking when you die here when
[1:22:09] you actually die here your body dies you
[1:22:12] have the you you have the power within
[1:22:13] you to resurrect that's how you're going
[1:22:15] to
[1:22:16] resurrect praise God because the word
[1:22:18] can't stay in the ground I'm a witness
[1:22:21] of it tonight I died with him at Calvary
[1:22:23] raised with him on Hallelujah to be part
[1:22:25] of him I have to be identified with him
[1:22:27] Amen to be a part of him you have to be
[1:22:30] identified with him you don't have a
[1:22:32] choice you have to be identified with
[1:22:34] him but if you think about it the
[1:22:35] Paradox of that statement is that you
[1:22:38] don't have a
[1:22:40] choice
[1:22:43] right God chose you you didn't choose
[1:22:45] him that's why that works because you're
[1:22:47] the word you didn't have a choice if
[1:22:48] you're going to be Christ you're got to
[1:22:49] always be Christ amen if you're going to
[1:22:52] be a part of God you have to always be a
[1:22:53] part of God because the script says
[1:22:55] right here in John 15 you have been with
[1:22:57] me from the beginning that's right those
[1:23:00] who are going to get catch the comforter
[1:23:02] those are that are going to receive the
[1:23:03] comforter had to already be with him
[1:23:05] from the beginning amen had to be
[1:23:08] because if you're going to be the word
[1:23:09] in flesh you have to always be the word
[1:23:12] you have to always because the word is
[1:23:14] what
[1:23:15] Eternal that's why that that's why
[1:23:17] predestination works because you always
[1:23:20] were a part of God he saw the decisions
[1:23:23] you would make he saw how you would live
[1:23:26] out your life right and he said those
[1:23:28] are the fruits of my word amen that's
[1:23:32] why it comes back to this thing over and
[1:23:34] over and over again the statue of a
[1:23:37] perfect man that's
[1:23:39] right so you have things in your life
[1:23:43] that are not subjected to the word of
[1:23:45] God you're not there yet so how do you
[1:23:48] get there self-help books
[1:23:51] meditation anger management classes no
[1:23:55] no you feed on the word of God that's
[1:23:57] right you know as a preacher I say those
[1:24:00] words and the flesh part of me says
[1:24:02] that's too
[1:24:04] simple but that's really all this is
[1:24:06] about that's right when you're here
[1:24:09] tonight you're hearing me
[1:24:11] preach I believe God's speaking through
[1:24:15] me it's the word you're hearing the
[1:24:19] word I think we would treat Church a lot
[1:24:21] different if we really understood that
[1:24:23] amen we really understood that we're
[1:24:26] here the word is is is you know look
[1:24:30] with me for a second the word is is out
[1:24:32] here and it it's bouncing off the walls
[1:24:36] it's circulating and what is it man no
[1:24:38] it's logos
[1:24:41] amen he says I am the
[1:24:44] word so when we speak the word right
[1:24:47] here right now standing here on this
[1:24:50] piece of carpet the word of God Christ
[1:24:53] himself is present because low cost am
[1:24:57] because it's the word so what do you
[1:24:59] have need
[1:25:00] of what do you have need of you want God
[1:25:03] put to to to to to test in your life ask
[1:25:08] what you want sister Nadia ask what you
[1:25:11] want the word of God has to come back
[1:25:16] full it cannot return void am the check
[1:25:19] can't be voided
[1:25:25] God has a
[1:25:26] promise sorry say not God has a promise
[1:25:29] for you I don't know what's going on
[1:25:31] here but this is God God has a promise
[1:25:32] for you sister amen and he will bring it
[1:25:34] to pass in your life that is thus sayith
[1:25:36] the Lord that's right amen God's word
[1:25:39] always comes to pass it cannot return
[1:25:42] void if God speaks it it has to happen
[1:25:46] and if you speak it as the word of God
[1:25:48] it has to happen amen but God won't let
[1:25:51] you speak it outside of his will because
[1:25:53] you are his word you won't move an inch
[1:25:55] from it that's right Saints if we really
[1:25:59] knew well we will really
[1:26:02] know praise
[1:26:05] God I am the identified Masterpiece of
[1:26:07] God that's
[1:26:09] right to be a part of him I have to be
[1:26:11] identified with
[1:26:12] him I was identified with him when the
[1:26:15] denominations turned him down I was
[1:26:17] identified with him when they ran him
[1:26:19] out of the temple that's right when they
[1:26:21] tried to get rid of him I was with him
[1:26:23] there that's it I was with him in his
[1:26:26] death raised with him in the
[1:26:28] resurrection
[1:26:30] amen that's
[1:26:35] absolutely and I was with the 120 when
[1:26:38] they climbed to The Upper Room yes sir I
[1:26:40] witnessed that Mighty rushing wind
[1:26:42] coming from Heaven
[1:26:44] amen I spoke in tongues with the
[1:26:46] anointed on the day of Pentecost why
[1:26:48] because you're the word amen you did too
[1:26:50] you spoke you were there he says well
[1:26:53] I've never spoken in Tong s yes you have
[1:26:55] you were there say well I've never
[1:26:58] raised the dead yes you have you were
[1:27:00] there amen says well I I I I've never
[1:27:03] you know I've never stood against
[1:27:04] opposition and and overcome it I've
[1:27:06] always cowered away no you haven't you
[1:27:08] were always there that's why Jesus said
[1:27:11] don't worry about it I'll put the words
[1:27:12] in your mouth why because you are the
[1:27:14] word amen so what do we need to tap into
[1:27:17] when we're fa with something what do we
[1:27:19] need to tap into the word amen not the
[1:27:22] universe the word word that's
[1:27:27] it and when the word washes over
[1:27:31] you that seed you know we just had some
[1:27:35] rain do you ever have y'all ever noticed
[1:27:37] how green it is after it rains yes sir
[1:27:39] it's a same grass that was there
[1:27:41] yesterday and it's not it's not
[1:27:44] wet the the rain has dried but it's
[1:27:48] green amen what is it it's the rain amen
[1:27:53] it is God in nature
[1:27:56] testifying of your life because he
[1:28:00] brought the washing of the word upon you
[1:28:04] and you saw colors you never seen before
[1:28:06] amen what because we're talking about
[1:28:08] colors no you saw something you saw
[1:28:12] something in the word of God you never
[1:28:13] saw before look everybody has this Bible
[1:28:16] but not everybody has the logos that's
[1:28:19] right exactly right this Bible is
[1:28:22] printed and taken all over the world
[1:28:24] world but it only affects logos that's
[1:28:27] right it only affects the word of God I
[1:28:31] was there because I'm identified with
[1:28:33] him that's right I preached with Peter
[1:28:35] in Acts 2 why I preached with him there
[1:28:38] that's why we can baptize in no other
[1:28:40] way but in the name of the Lord Jesus
[1:28:41] Christ because we're the word and we
[1:28:44] were there amen that's why when you
[1:28:46] heard serpent CED for the first time you
[1:28:47] said man that makes so much sense why
[1:28:49] because you thought different no no no
[1:28:51] because you're the word and when the
[1:28:53] word comes to the word the word
[1:28:55] recognizes it amen when the word comes
[1:28:58] to the word so when the word comes to
[1:29:00] you the word inside of you you didn't
[1:29:03] even know what's there recognizes the
[1:29:05] word that's right and then your life
[1:29:08] testifies of it that's why I don't have
[1:29:10] to worry about it when somebody's coming
[1:29:11] to the Lord and they look like a mess
[1:29:13] don't worry that's right the word will
[1:29:15] change that's right the word will change
[1:29:17] why because they realize this isn't who
[1:29:19] I am you know it's like somebody who
[1:29:22] who's growing up and they they growing
[1:29:23] up in a city but in their heart they
[1:29:25] they love nature and they love being in
[1:29:27] the outdoors and they love the the
[1:29:29] countryside as soon as you put them in
[1:29:31] the right environment they dress
[1:29:33] different they act different they have
[1:29:34] different activities why because it's
[1:29:35] who they really are that's right so as
[1:29:39] soon as you put you in in a different
[1:29:41] environment who you really are comes to
[1:29:44] life that's right that's why it's so
[1:29:47] important the atmosphere you dwell in
[1:29:49] that's right amen you're going to go to
[1:29:51] a bar and testify to somebody you just
[1:29:53] put yourself in the wrong environment
[1:29:54] amen that's an extreme example so every
[1:29:57] day you live your life your home your
[1:30:00] cubicle at work your desk your
[1:30:04] tractor your
[1:30:07] toolbag your
[1:30:09] truck has to be the environment of
[1:30:13] Christ you watch your life change you
[1:30:16] watch your life change and then when you
[1:30:17] play something when you do something in
[1:30:19] there not sinful but not the word the
[1:30:22] atmosphere shifts that's right
[1:30:25] for example let's say you have a tape
[1:30:26] playing the atmosphere is there you
[1:30:29] pause the tape your kid send you a video
[1:30:32] of cats you watch the kitty cats guess
[1:30:34] what atmosphere shifts it's not bad but
[1:30:36] it's not Christ atmosphere
[1:30:41] shifts
[1:30:43] so you're thinking I don't feel God I
[1:30:46] don't even feel like going to church
[1:30:48] change your atmosphere that's it amen
[1:30:52] you're sitting at home and say I don't
[1:30:53] even want to go to church tonight put on
[1:30:55] a tape put on put on anointed music of
[1:30:57] the Holy Ghost guess what you go to
[1:31:00] church I mean you will anyways but the
[1:31:03] desire will come why because the word
[1:31:05] says wow I need more of this and I'm
[1:31:07] going to go get it at church brother bam
[1:31:09] talks about the that that disc
[1:31:12] disc whatever it was they
[1:31:15] had that played the music and he said I
[1:31:17] just play that all the time when I'm
[1:31:19] feeling down I turn that on you see what
[1:31:22] it what why is it is it just because
[1:31:23] it's music knows cuz it's word music
[1:31:26] it's a music of of Christ and I'm only
[1:31:28] saying that because you have the power
[1:31:29] to create the atmosphere and and and the
[1:31:31] point that the holy spirit is trying to
[1:31:33] make tonight is that many times we try
[1:31:35] to just change the atmosphere instead of
[1:31:37] doing
[1:31:39] that excuse me we try to just change our
[1:31:41] atmosphere no don't approach it like
[1:31:44] that go to the thing you need to change
[1:31:47] the
[1:31:48] atmosphere you brother bam had the
[1:31:50] atmosphere in him when he went into the
[1:31:52] kitchen he was already there she wasn't
[1:31:55] so he was the Catalyst for the
[1:31:58] atmosphere changed the atmosphere shift
[1:32:01] he was a catalyst but if it's your whole
[1:32:03] family is a mess the day is not going
[1:32:05] good it's Monday on a
[1:32:07] Thursday don't try to just say okay guys
[1:32:10] let's just stop having a bad
[1:32:12] attitude that's not going to
[1:32:16] work put on a tape read the Bible pray
[1:32:20] what are you're doing you're saying God
[1:32:22] changed my atmosphere you're saying
[1:32:24] you're bringing word into the present
[1:32:26] that's right and that is what shifts is
[1:32:28] you need healing in your life bring word
[1:32:30] to the
[1:32:32] present don't think about how God might
[1:32:34] heal you someday bring word to the
[1:32:36] present I like that bring word to your
[1:32:40] present whatever your present is bring
[1:32:43] the word here amen that's
[1:32:47] right praise the Lord
[1:32:55] I preached with Paul on Marsh Hill
[1:32:56] before the critics yes sir I had to
[1:32:59] be I was with John on the aisle of patas
[1:33:02] patmas see I've never boiled in oil yes
[1:33:05] you have I saw the vision of his coming
[1:33:09] I saw Luther yes sir I was with him when
[1:33:12] in the Reformation I was with
[1:33:15] Wesley
[1:33:16] so the
[1:33:18] word always the word amen okay I'm
[1:33:22] closing here soon
[1:33:25] next quote identified Masterpiece of God
[1:33:27] he says come back and let the master
[1:33:30] we're going to close with this come back
[1:33:32] and let the master pick up the bow so
[1:33:34] he's he's talking
[1:33:36] about it's the same Sermon Just further
[1:33:39] down and he talks about how he was with
[1:33:42] God and Christ and he was there with
[1:33:44] Paul and he was there with Wesley and
[1:33:46] all these things and and he he
[1:33:48] immediately he get he says you remember
[1:33:49] the story about the
[1:33:52] violin does that feel like a dramatic
[1:33:54] shift in thought
[1:33:57] process if you don't slow down you think
[1:33:59] it you think it is he oh he just turned
[1:34:01] a corner no he's
[1:34:03] expounding he's expounding on the idea
[1:34:05] that we are him we were with him amen
[1:34:09] okay
[1:34:10] so the flesh is always there with you
[1:34:12] it's a paradox right it's always there
[1:34:14] so now here's here is the recipe for
[1:34:18] Success he says let the master pick up
[1:34:21] the bow that's it he says oh I'm the
[1:34:24] word I was always the word I was with
[1:34:27] God yes but let the master pick up the
[1:34:30] bat that's right you tried to play the
[1:34:32] violin who'll give me $1 he'll give me
[1:34:39] three and then the man came forward and
[1:34:42] picked up the bow what Christ the man
[1:34:44] Jesus Christ the son of man came and
[1:34:48] picked up the bow and began to play a
[1:34:50] song on your
[1:34:51] life that's it and that's when the word
[1:34:54] resonated forth and says I was with Paul
[1:34:56] on Marsh Hill the word came forth and
[1:34:59] say I was with Wesley what is why the
[1:35:02] sound I keep listening for a different
[1:35:07] sound why your life now makes a
[1:35:10] different sound you sing to a new tune
[1:35:13] because the master picked up the bow
[1:35:16] stop trying to make the word come to
[1:35:19] flesh let the master pick up the bow
[1:35:22] amen he says let the master pick you up
[1:35:24] in his hands strike the word that's it
[1:35:28] amen strike the word you try to strike
[1:35:31] the word in your flesh who give me$ one
[1:35:34] who give me
[1:35:36] three but you let the master strike the
[1:35:39] word in your
[1:35:40] life 1,000 2,000 5,000
[1:35:45] more what made the difference it was the
[1:35:48] touch of the Master's Hand say Jesus
[1:35:51] Christ is the same yesterday to today
[1:35:54] and forever you see what I said last
[1:35:55] Wednesday you always will come back to
[1:35:57] that scripture say Amen Lord Make Me
[1:36:00] mold me make me Lord what I should be
[1:36:03] the clay can't make the pot the master
[1:36:06] makes the clay the pot amen the master
[1:36:10] makes the flesh the Manifest the word
[1:36:13] amen the word is there the word is in
[1:36:15] you but you will fail every time because
[1:36:18] you need the touch of the Master's
[1:36:21] Hand he said then there'll be a then
[1:36:24] there will be a different
[1:36:28] thing how 1 2 3 four five what is that
[1:36:34] five words one two three four five six
[1:36:37] words six words that is your entire life
[1:36:41] right there then there'll be a different
[1:36:43] thing what the word of Christ the word
[1:36:47] speaking through you then if I be lifted
[1:36:49] up from the earth I will draw all men
[1:36:51] unto me yes sir he's cutting you out now
[1:36:54] remember this is the identified
[1:36:55] Masterpiece of God so he's talking about
[1:36:57] the the the the the man who built the
[1:36:59] Statue he shuck the the
[1:37:01] knee and when he did that he made a
[1:37:03] masterpiece why because nobody could
[1:37:06] mimic that
[1:37:07] strike it pleased the
[1:37:11] father to strike him it pleased the Lord
[1:37:15] to strike you why because he's cutting
[1:37:18] you out now cutting you down to his word
[1:37:21] only so you have the flesh and you have
[1:37:24] the word But as time progresses there'll
[1:37:27] be less flesh more word amen
[1:37:30] until you
[1:37:31] see this is why the Rapture I said I was
[1:37:35] closing this is why the Rapture faith is
[1:37:37] in you
[1:37:39] already because your body will get to a
[1:37:41] place where there's so much word amen
[1:37:44] and so little flesh it has to Rapture
[1:37:48] because all word can't all word in a
[1:37:51] body can't stay here that's what Enoch
[1:37:55] did his body became all word
[1:38:00] amen so that's the goal all word cutting
[1:38:03] you down musicians will come tonight
[1:38:05] cutting you down to his word only
[1:38:08] cutting all the Creeds and dogmas and
[1:38:11] everything away from you in other words
[1:38:13] the lies the devil told you dogmas
[1:38:16] that's false Doctrine that's right the
[1:38:18] devil can't speak truth the lies the
[1:38:20] devil has told you he's cutting those
[1:38:22] away you see but I I I I I I sinned yeah
[1:38:27] because you didn't know you you believe
[1:38:28] the devil's
[1:38:29] lie you you took the bottle because you
[1:38:31] believe the devil's lie you believe
[1:38:33] that's who you
[1:38:34] were but then when you saw who you
[1:38:36] really were then you
[1:38:38] changed brother bud when did you stop
[1:38:41] smoking just now what happened word met
[1:38:44] word right amen everything away from you
[1:38:47] trying to get back to a bride for the
[1:38:51] son another masterpiece
[1:38:54] part of the word
[1:38:56] amen you see Saints it's not of our own
[1:38:58] abilities
[1:39:00] no that's why his strength is perfected
[1:39:03] in our weakness right
[1:39:06] because if we weren't
[1:39:08] weak why would the master need to pick
[1:39:11] up the
[1:39:12] bow if we weren't sick why would the
[1:39:15] Healer we wouldn't need a Healer
[1:39:18] right the only way for the word to come
[1:39:21] through in your life is for the master
[1:39:24] to pick up the
[1:39:27] bow The Man Standing on the platform had
[1:39:30] to
[1:39:31] hand the master the
[1:39:33] violin and the boat he had to give him
[1:39:37] over the music for the
[1:39:42] orchestra brother talks about Orchestra
[1:39:45] and Symphony and the
[1:39:48] sympathizers
[1:39:50] sympathy the strings in the piano right
[1:39:53] cuz the only way for the word to come
[1:39:56] forth from
[1:39:58] you I I just can't get away from that
[1:40:00] that's why I keep saying is for the
[1:40:01] master to pick up the bow maybe you
[1:40:04] somebody needs to maybe I need to hear
[1:40:06] that more than
[1:40:11] once let's bow our
[1:40:14] [Music]
[1:40:18] heads Heavenly Father Lord Jesus
[1:40:22] [Music]

[1:41:10] Mystery of the
[1:41:12] parable the mystery of how the word
[1:41:14] could be within us and and we are the
[1:41:17] word made flesh and the Mystery of of of
[1:41:20] how we were with you when you died on
[1:41:22] the cross
