worthy is he not a man praise the Lord I trust you guys had a good weekend hey man we had a good weekend God come down I don't know that my thought was so stellar but the presence of the Lord come and moved amongst the people anyhow and had some some of the Saints had certain things that they just desired you know sometimes Saints you just you just don't realize what's going on with everyone around you and you know just to see the needs of the of the believers being satisfied by the preaching of the word is always a very very encouraging thing stir our hearts while there was other needs that were very very important and we're believing that the Lord would bring fulfillment and deliverance it stirred my heart just to see a little sister hard to judge age sometimes but just a young sister come to the altar and just desiring to give her heart to the Lord and that always just stirs your heart I mean one soul were ten thousand world to this all the all the time of studying all the time of preparation all the nerves all of that when it's all done you look and say thank you Lord now I believe that that little girl would find the time the place the right circumstance no matter what it had nothing to do with us but yet God would allow us to be part of that and that's always encouraging amen well god bless you all let's just stand and go into the Bible tonight and read from Ephesians the 3rd chapter God bless our musician song leader well god bless every one of you amen turn to Ephesians the 3rd chapter starting with the ninth verse I want to speak to you this evening on the inner man and you know it's a it's a lovely thing just there's there's way more than what I have will present to you tonight but just sometimes it's just beautiful just to take you know well let me liken it to you this way sometimes when you're walking in a beautiful place and it's just acres and acres of flowers but there'll be one flower that catches your attention and you might pick that one flower even though there's another flower of the same kind right next to it or just there that one flower maybe it followed you when you walked or responded to your voice I don't know but we're going to just pull one little flower out of God's Word tonight and by God's grace we'll be able to magnify the beauty of that flower verse 9 and to make all men see what is the Fellowship of the mystery which from the beginning of the world hath been hid in God who created all things by Jesus Christ to the intent that now unto the principalities and powers in heavenly places might be made known by the church the manifold wisdom of God according to the eternal purpose which he purposed in Christ Jesus our Lord in whom we have boldness amen we should have boldness amen and access with confidence by the faith of him I love verse 12 it really it would be if we didn't draw anything else tonight that we should know that we can come boldly and with confidence we have that access to the throne amen hallelujah wherefore I desire that you faint not at my tribulations for you which is your glory for this cause I bow my knees in to the father of our Lord Jesus Christ of whom the whole family in heaven and earth is named that he would grant you according to the riches of his glory to be strengthened with might by his spirit in the inner man that Christ may dwell in your hearts by faith that ye being rooted and grounded in love may be able to comprehend with All Saints what is the breadth and length and depth and height and to know the love of Christ which passeth all knowledge that he might be filled with all fullness of God now into him that is able to do exceeding abundantly above all that we ask or think according to the power that worketh in us unto Him be glory in the church by Christ Jesus throughout oh excuse me throughout all ages world without end amen Heavenly Father we just ask your blessings on the service this evening father as we would just go into your word go into the message I pray father give us wisdom give us leadership we ask in the name of Jesus Christ amen you may be seated as we would look at this it just struck me I kept coming back to this and you know looking at the the whole picture starting with verse nine that we would see what the fellowship of the mystery from the beginning of the world had been hid in God you know my brother and sister is so amazing when we think about God's plan how that it was so perfect from beginning to end and we look at the part that God has called you and I to play what a glorious part that it is and if we are not careful we can get caught up in the cares of the day-to-day life and life can you might say draw us down or drag us down but my brother and sister if we just stop and truly look into the Word of God will recognize that we've been called into one of the greatest positions that man has ever been called to now we know that trial and tribulation is just part of life it is not even singularly identified with being a Christian but life itself is full of travail it's short and full of travail you know to put it in an old friend of mine it doesn't happen to be a Christian but just man that's been a good friend to me through the years he put it much more blunt he said life is tough and then you die and so you know it is has a certain value there that we recognize that whether you're Christian or not here's a man who's not a Christian at all and that's how he views life it's tough and so we don't want to ever let Satan common anoint us that our life as a Christian is almost bringing us to a place of despondency or a place that we could give up from but we want to just stand because the mystery of this the Fellowship of this mystery my brother and sister is not something that we dig through the book one day and suddenly something jumped out and we said that's it but this fellowship of the mystery my brother and sister as the scripture teaches us is Christ in us and as we take this position knowing now this is something you have to emphatically declare maybe not to the world as it were but to yourself that you know who you are you cannot just go through this Christian life just kind of hoping it will not work you have to know who you are amen now is an eternal purpose that God has purposed in Christ Jesus our Lord now we have to understand my brother and sister this eternal purpose was not something just fulfilled in the life of Jesus Christ but as the message he being the firstfruits he come down poured out his spirit and he poured it into you and I and we look in this in the day that we're living Satan's whole goal is to get us to a place if we will not renounce our faith in Jesus Christ if we will not back away from it forsake it but we will come to a place that we buy certain things in our life would nullify that this calling in our life would would take all the authority take the power from it my brother and sister he can leave us in church are you with me Satan can leave us in church and be the robber who stole everything from us so we can sit in church and be very unfulfilled because we've let the thief in the house now you say brother Paul I don't remember we left the door open I don't know when and where and how my brother my sister the scripture says that he is clever and he can anoint a time and a season he can see what's happening you know it would be as a one brother referred to at one time as the repetitious sin and that would be that shortcoming in our life that the prophet of God showed us so clearly that's the very thing of all things in your life that you must cover you must not just say well God's going to deliver me someday the prophet of God taught us that when you recognize that weakness in your life you cover that weakness you make sure that Satan does not have access now I'm sure that all of us would recognize what some of the downfalls we have in our own lives and to see that but you see my brother and sister Satan wants to break up this eternal purpose that has been given in the calling that we have in our life if he can break off the eternal purpose by injecting something I just listening to the Prophet today doors in a door my brother and sister he's talking about how that Satan would come and he wants to get access one of the things that brother branham it struck me so strongly of this the second time I've listened to the sermon just recently his brother Branham comes down as he's talking about different things the one that reached out and struck me so strongly when brother Branham starts to talk about the door of our personal life so it's there that it's not looking at the world conditions we can look my brother and sister with the Catholics are doing and what everybody else is doing we look out there we can look at what's happening in the message we can look what's happening in our church we can look at what's happening our family but the thing that we need to look at is our personal life there's the thing where Satan would come in and now there will be many influences my brother and sister I'm amazed at the amount of fear I find around the message of people who are are concerned there they're afraid of what's happening they're afraid of this this they gave it a new name or something but this coronavirus people in the message Holy Ghost filled people that have let fear creep into their life and and you know they're talking about how you know they walk to their car and and they're even thinking that they're not going to touch the door handle on their own car lest some kind of germ has fallen upon it and they get in their car and they wash their hands or put sanitizer and they do and I was amazed that we were just out and about a little bit and people walking into a restaurant and pulling their sleeves down and reaching over to take a Hoult's of the handle my brother and sister that ain't no way to live Amen we're not called to have that kind of fear yes we ought to wash our hands we ought to do you know the same basic things that our momma taught us to do many years ago but my brother and sisters sons and daughters of God because the Holy Spirit the scripture says the Holy Spirit casts out all fear now it's one thing to say okay we're gonna heighten our you know our hygiene so to speak a little bit or something but I'm just talking about the spirit of fear my brother and sister bind that spirit don't let it grow anymore don't let it hold you back because that spirit of fear that might come in concerning a virus around the world will then work its way in to the fear of whether your life is worthy whether you are right or wrong it'll creep right into every part of your life because that seed is the same seed it just takes on a different manifestation and so let's have confidence as we come before the throne of Almighty God we have a boldness and an access verse 12 and with confidence by faith of him that God brought us here he will take care of us you say but brother Paul there's circumstance yes there is but if you get caught up in that you will be caught up not where God wants you to be but you'll be caught up in the fear of this life my brother and sister I think it's an interesting thing amen as Paul is speaking here you know he says I desire that you faint not at my tribulations for you now imagine my brother and sister if we could really catch the the very depth I believe of the relationship the Apostle Paul had how intense that he would have been I I know and I hate to admit this but it's the truth that I get nervous around super-intense people you know that that are just you know so to speak you know I I know an individual you talk to them and they start the conversation out here they finish the conversation right here I get nervous when they get inside that space do you know what I'm talking about and so you know if we're not careful though we get anointed when the spirit or the presence of God comes in around us and we start to get nervous we'll back away from that we will move away and brother Adam says that that's the time that we should press into the presence of God when he comes down when we feel the moving of the Holy Spirit press into that amen otherwise we'll back away we'll say well I don't know you know this just I'm nervous about it well you might very well be nervous but you might as well just press into it my brother and sister because when the Spirit of God is moving amen we push the world out amen so you look at this and you know it's amazing verse 16 that he would grant you according to the riches of his glory to be strengthened with might by his spirit in the inner man now I want you to just grass that today my brother and sister this separation that there is between the outer man and there is so much information in the message you just have to kind of prune it down and just bring that little portion that you feel like you can deliver but my brother and sister the great segregation my brother and sister I thought it was great listening brother Brown the other day and he said every believer every Christian is a segregationist oh my you clip that quote out you know how people like to do it would make it sound like brother Brandon was trying to you know be racist or some other thing but brother Branham goes on then to declare that every true believer will separate himself from the world and so you look at that and we want to focus for just a little bit tonight on the inner man you look at this there is even to a degree of segregation between the inner man and the outer man now we understand that the outer man my brother and sister is influenced by relative things that we would know you know sight and smell and taste and all these things but when you look at that we're not even dealing in that natural side the outer man my brother and sister the prophet of God shows us how that the outer man can be anointed by the spirit all the days of his life now this is a tough quote be anointed all the days of his life and go to hell you see we got to recognize that it is not what is applying as it were to the outer man but what makes it down into the inner man will come and the inner man will be the spirit on the inner man the Holy Ghost will change the outer man right we're not trying to work from the outside in we're working from the inside out and by God's grace amen aren't you glad you can say I just love that little little saying that sister had you know I what I want to be amen you know but praise God amen I'm not what I used to be hallelujah you know so we know we recognize our own shortcomings can someone say amen to that we recognize that but the thing we also recognize and I hope you can say Amen to this is that the inside the inner man is changing us now the man is not something of an outward work of some good deed we have chose to do something that we have manifested it is something my brother and sister that transcends just the human nature our human desires now I wished I'd have brought my phone out here my brother Lucas down there just a great friend brother Lucas we're sharing a statement with me and I'll mess it up so I'll just wait til I have it to read it to you but my brother and sister you cannot change you by just hoping you'll change you have to act and when you act you will change now it's a matter of motion I preached my message there in Phoenix was reactions and I I believe I will probably after all our visiting ministers pass through here I'll probably go ahead and preach some version of that but my brother and sister we understand under Newton's rules Newton's law there that everything that has a pressure everything that has an action has an opposite or equal reaction so what is happening is if we are reacting as it is now I read all kinds of farm magazines that are telling us over and over and over in the financial side of farming they're saying you cannot be a reactor you must be ahead of the curve not a reactor because the market will go up and then already be going down by the time you react you need to know where you're at I hope you can apply that spiritually we don't want to be out here constantly buffeted by Satan in our lives because we're reactionary we need to be as it were now reactionary you say brother Paul what do you mean by that well the foolish virgin was reactionary amen they'd already heard the bridegroom cometh before they went into action are you with me so you see we're not called to be reactionary my brother and sister although them gets complicated nothing's ever fixed it gets that point that when the Holy Spirit moves on us now according to Newton's law if something there is an action there must be a reaction so when the Holy Spirit comes in our presence starts moving around us in the church in the car in the house might be sisters cooking dinner vacuuming floors whatever it is when the presence of God comes there will be a reaction do you know that we can actually front-load this equation and already determine what the reaction will be before we've ever felt the action right that is to train ourselves brother Branham wanted to he spoke it I think more than once were how he wanted to just come into a city and he wanted to just sit down with the people and he wanted to teach them do you know what I'm talking about he wanted to teach them on how to get the Holy Ghost and how to apply the things of God he wanted to just as it were show the people now you can't teach these things right we talked about that our last service here you cannot teach someone revelation but when revelation comes it can be presented and God Himself will anoint the people to receive that revelation so you know if you want to get technical you can teach revelation but it must come from heaven to affect you and I so we look at that and realize what God is doing now as we see here he's moving us that we can come and then our focus would be strengthened with might by his spirit in the inner man there my brother and sister is where the Holy Ghost comes and makes you bomb-proof he makes you fireproof he makes you Laodicea proof amen that's the strength in the inner man it's not the strength on the outer man now look we can speak all kinds of words you know I shared and I've shared it here at the church but my brother and sister you know just that little saying I heard your words but your actions tell me all I need no you see anyone can speak I've got a quote and I didn't put it in here and I won't go dig for it but brother branham's talking about how that anyone can speak anyone can speak it but what is being lived out that's the important part and so what we want to do is come into a place that we become very cognizant we've become very aware of the moving of the Spirit and you know brother Branham shows us how that many times the Holy Spirit would come down and it would move in a service and there would be someone there I don't mind my brain is running away from me but I played it oh I don't know quite a long time ago what brother Branham is calling out he's calling out to that lady and he's telling her you know respond and then there's a pause you listen to it on the tape it's way more profound than reading it it is a respond oh you missed it now imagine my brother and sister that the Holy Spirit was speaking through his prophet and something good was coming your way but something affected you in a way that you could not respond mister healing mister deliverance mist whatever the situation was you see we don't want to come into that and my brother and sister I'll put it this way you can come and and I don't mean this myself or anyone else but you can be listening to the most cut-up stuttering slobbering whatever kind of preacher and God still honor and come into that meeting he'll come right down and move in our miss one of the song leaders I'll never even halfway reveal who this is but a song leader he's a wonderful man he's just a gracious man but you know he's the kind of song leader he's from the deep south and you can't hardly understand him unless you're from the deep south but I'll tell you when that man gets up and leads songs and not know the thing I like is the tempo or whatever you call it the music he's up there thumping on the platform just the opposite you know difficult but one thing about that brother is the presence of God comes down you know I didn't word it maybe so well there a brother got up and sang the song waymaker I know the brother slightly he's had a tough life things are still a little tough but he gets up and he sings a song waymaker I used it as a reference later in my sermon because I said you see the woman that's on YouTube you know that Pentecostal lady that sings waymaker if you've listened to that you know she can belt that out she must have a set of lungs the size of this pulpit and she belts that thing out my brother and sister I just got bowled I said look that brother and no reference to him but he didn't sing it near as well as she did but the thing that we know is when he sang it the presence of God come down in our midst so it's not about our ability see there's one of our problems God's give us great talents in arm it's the message now some of the best ministers that there is on the face of the earth that some of the best musicians there is on the face of the earth some of the best singers there on the face of the earth but it still come it's not human talent it's our yielding to the Holy Spirit that makes that a beautiful thing so as we look at this we're looking to the inner man I would like to look here into the sermon looking at the unseen now my brother and sister brother branham here now speaks he says it is a strange thing that man who is made in the image and likeness of God and was called of him to walk by faith believing that God is would choose to walk by sight instead of by faith hmm after his make up his being and all that dwells in him was fashioned in the likeness of God and God is that great Jehovah who calls those things which were not as though they were and man made to live with God in this manner yet he's chosen to walk by his sight now I want to say I think probably all of us are guilty of that there's times that we need to distrust God and we're gonna fix it no matter what but my brother and listen look listen to this and man made to live with God not just around God I will would that could we put an emphasis on that the difference of being around you know if you say well Matt that woman lives with that man you're not expecting to find her in a tent in the front yard right so this is not some casual thing a man made to live with God in this manner yet he has he chosen to walk by his side he wants to be his own boss he wants no one to tell him what to do that's just the nature of man it proved to be thus in the Garden of Eden when he had lost his fellowship with God by choosing to go his own way and not having anyone rule over him but a man is made like a sheep and a sheep cannot find its way back I'm told when it's lost its totally lost you know that reminds me I remember is that New Zealand or wherever they had the Sheep named Shrek have you ever seen pictures that sheep here he just had this bundle of wool they said when he would lay down he almost could not get back on his feet because he had this wool that was so dense and coarse had a lot of dirt and whatever else in it and so they the man who discovered him noticed that this sheep hardly ever laid down now my brother and sister a sheep was not made to rest on its feet man was not made to rest on his feet so there has to come a time that we're willing to lay down amen choosing us but a man is made like a sheep and a sheep cannot find its way back I'm told when it's lost its totally lost and that's the way with man when he has lost his absolutely helpless he must have a shepherd to guide him and man when he choose as days go on we find men continually getting worse choosing rather to walk by sight instead of by faith by the unseen and when he does that he Rob's the inner man I like how brother branham words this because what happens is is a minute we go into the realm of we walk by sight walk by the flesh we are then opening the door to let Satan come in and the inner man now is robbed of the promises and the power of God's Word so there Satan working because he gets us to the place we want to do it our way and that is causing the inner man to be robbed which is the soul and that's the eternal part of man now man shall not live by bread alone said the Lord but by every word that proceedeth out of the mouth of God and a man's physical being to be taken care of is not all the reason God put him on the earth because what he does with his physical being amounts to very little now just speaking out my thoughts this evening - sister Jerry just a quip if we could give the attention to the inner man that we give to the outer man what effect would that have on our spiritual walk right we make sure that we have a good mattress if you don't you should we make sure we got a good mattress we we don't turn the heat off and freeze at night we don't turn it way up so we sweat all night we like to eat whatever you might be I was going to make a joke and what sister Lee walked in I just like boy she just walked right into this you know I'm sister Emily my sister in Christ but she eats things I refuse to but I have scenery - ice cream so anyway but look my brother and sister I just say that in humor but but look see we have all kinds right you know the sister Jerry's got on this kick of Brussels sprouts and fried walnuts well you know some people are saying yum yum right now but some of us won't be saying yum yum but look my brother and sister how we take care of the outer man we close it we buy comfortable shoes we'd want to drive a a decent car with a heater we want to do all kinds of things and we do all of these things for the outer man for one it might be chocolate for one it might be ice cream or cheesecake or a pie we have all kinds of things and we say well I have a sweet tooth well my brother and sister if we could give a portion to the inner man that we give to the outer man oh I think it would change our spiritual walk hey man we can sit in a restaurant and take two hours eating a fine meal we can do all kinds of things I'm not trying to place it as don't do these things but I hope you catch the comparison that I'm trying to put in place so the inner man is is being robbed as it was in the other part of the quote now man shall not live by bread alone said the Lord but by every word that proceedeth out of the mouth of God and a man's physical being to be taken care of is not all the reason God put him on the earth although if we had good Christian stewardship we will take care of that man because what he does with this physical being amounts to very little it's his soul what counts it's the inward man that did not come from the earth now you know sometimes I just catch a bigger significance probably than there really is there but you see brother branham said that did not come from the earth it come from heaven and that's the eternal part of the human being so we're here my brother and sister now we realize when we take the breath of life that the spirit of life comes into us there you know and and we are there you know the whole argument of whether you know at what point is a baby alive and all of these things that's irrelevant we know my brother and sister while snotty irrelevant but we know who we are as a baby we were born laid on to our mother's breast and we're there we're totally helpless I read something interesting the other day in the animal kingdom a human baby is the most helpless of all mammals or animals or whatever the terminology was because it's six months eight months a year the deer the elk the bear the mountain lion the dog the cat they're all able to take care of themselves but at a year a baby is still completely dependent oh if we could just catch the revelation of that they'll never come a time were not completely dependent on Jesus Christ that's the eternal part of the human being but yet strange that he tries to figure his own way out and we find it so in the scriptures that when a man choose to walk in his own way and do the way once to God just lets him alone man must not think for himself but he must let the mind that was in Christ be in him we're not to think for ourselves were to call anything contrary to what he said as though it is not no matter what our eyes claim to be we do not live by what we see we live by what we believe my brother and sister the day that we're living in right now if we lived by what we saw oh my goodness what a wreck it's just absolutely a wreck I mean I won't go there my mind goes to some examples I think I'll just skip over them but my brother and sister let's just say that there's a large piece of humanity that should dress much more modest because there's nothing attractive about the way they dress and so it's there that that anointing comes though and the outer man then believes that they have some thing that is beautiful they have something that is there but my brother and sister we recognized by the Word of God that righteousness and holiness these things are also a covering for us they're not just a way that we live but it's God's covering for us now I'd like to just move on here for the sake of time in question answers on Hebrews part three brother branham says this now the Bible said there's no condemnation to them that's in Christ Jesus that walk not after the flesh but after the spirit so we recognize there's a whole shift right continuity through the scripture that we're not to walk after our flesh walk after our own way but to walk after the spirit now as I already spoke my brother and sister a man can be anointed on his flesh all the days of his life but that's not what the Scriptures talking about that's not what the prophet of God's talking about he's talking about the Holy Ghost inside of a man or a woman and that would cause them to not walk after the flesh of this this Laodicean age here the spiritual man has a spiritual soul that can never die and the carnal man has a religious atmosphere around him I want you to catch the significance of this God give us wisdom God give us discernment my brother and sister to not get caught up where we just simply have a religious atmosphere now brother Branham in other places talks about religious spirits he says that a religious spirit is one of the this is my paraphrasing of it is one of the most dangerous spirits that we can have to get a religious anointing on us we feel spiritual we feel you know empowered enlightened etc but we need to make sure that we're not walking after the flesh but after the spirit brother Branham also says that you'll be able to understand or see when God is moving on a man because a man will always surrender or yield to the Holy Spirit so will be no pushback you know well I can't believe that well if it's the word we will say amen to it is the word we will say I want to be obedient to it and so it's there that it's not just simply speaking the word right you're going back to Mishawaka there were that camp those people that were there my brother and sister no doubt if the prophet of God had not saw by vision that men's lives he would have thought both of them men equally spiritual but one man had a holy ghost another man had what brother brems talking right here he had a religious atmosphere around him but the prophet of God said in the vision imagine how that must have shook him up I can only imagine I mean I just it would have had to have shook him up to catch that vision and to see that that man had a another had a mistress I guess you would call it with children and a wife over here and and still spoke in tongues and had this religious atmosphere oh lord give us discernment give us wisdom in fact Lord to seal us that we would never be influenced by that kind of a relationship or a friendship or whatever and wants to worship and so forth but is carnal look at this this is actually when I read this I had to just read it over again because when I first read it it kind of caught me off guard and he said not an unbeliever but a carnal believer and it was the kind was rejected he could take every portion of the word now this is going to be a little catch of it in a carnal way say Amen to every word but it wasn't the soul that was speaking it was the mind a physical response of amen is possible to any heathen are you with me any heathen can say Amen but it's when the soul now I this is not in our notes and I'm going bounced out to here real quick because I just think I should and I'm gonna go right here and hopefully I can find this quote really really fast because I think it fits right here now you look right here my brother and sister what I'm fixing to read to you if I can find it yes now this is a 60 March 10th 1960 Elijah in the middle offering and there it was when they walked into the fiery furnace under trial under a test they held true to the end but God was there just in the spare of a moment and he delivered them they knowed they were prayed up their sins were confessed they know they had met every requirement yet he seemed to be silent he's only silent to test you to see what you see really what you are what's on the inside of you to see if you really mean from your heart what you're saying with your lips let that go deep we can say with our lips but is our heart saying it see the difference this carnal believer can speak Amen to the word with his lips but he's not saying Amen to the word with his heart so there we see how this inner man it's not just a matter of my brother and sister that we anoint be anointed to jump and shout but we want to have a spiritual man because we have a spiritual soul can we say amen to that that can never die amen the spiritual man the real you and I can we get it down to in that language the real you and I cannot die hallelujah so you look at that and you recognize what God is doing see he wants to anoint us in the inner man and the outer man not just one or the other but he wants to anoint the inner man and anoint the outer man amen look at this now Satan trying to tell you to quit now I believe probably every believer at some time in some fashion you know has just felt like quitting just felt like kind of sitting down but my brother and sister we don't have to have that kind of a argument with the devil we're not required to argue with the devil we are allowed by the Word of God to simply tell Satan that is behind me I spoke this to you the other day that is behind me Satan that is finished so we don't have to have the argument about am i or am I not now am I am I saved or am I not saved do I have the Holy Ghost or I don't have the Holy Ghost just tell Satan that argument was already settled now this will be something we'll touch on a little later but I just want to plant this little seed to you I preached on the thought of reaction down there in Phoenix and a brother come to me and he said brother Paul he said I just couldn't help myself in the service everything that fit with what you're saying there and he had all of these different phrases that he did and one of those that tied with it he said you know it was there and you look it up and it's really cool because it's right in the message he had by inspiration he said I don't know maybe I heard it and just remembered but you know brother branham shows us that calvary was actually a transaction it's interesting right what is the definition of a transaction a price has been paid amen the price was paid it was a transaction it would be just like walking into the store and they say that is $50 to complete the transaction you have to pay the price so the $50 is laid down the transaction is complete Jesus Christ knew oh mighty God knew that before the foundation of the world right because Calvary was just the outward expression would have taken place before the foundation of the world so the lamb slain before the foundation of the world God said there's going to be a transaction and sons and daughters of God when they see that transaction took and realize it was for them it will no longer be an argument of am I saved or not they'll be able to look back and say the transaction is there and the receipt is the resurrection hallelujah the evidence that the transaction took place come about in the resurrection so we'll see how that God did that not to redeem the outer man but to redeem the inner man but the outer man come with it amen because we're not going to be able to say we got the Holy Ghost my brother and sister and just go on our life unchanged it might be a good person but having the Holy Ghost changes you and I hallelujah now I'd like to go into here you him and we'll just kind of wind our service down here tonight you know maybe this scripture has been read by tens of thousands of people since it has been written and every time you read it you learn something new I have to say amen to that pick my Bible up start reading always something we didn't see before because it's the word of the eternal god I'd write you a letter you would appreciate it you'd write me one I would appreciate it but as soon as you had read it and the message of it to you or I read yours that would perhaps settle the value of the letter if you should keep it for your children to read or someone else it would not mean much now I can tell you the truth of this because I'm cleaning out some old stuff some old records and some old things and and there's some letters there and unless you had been there the letter is completely meaningless come on sense unless you had been there it's completely meaningless so I read yours that would perhaps settle the values of the letter if you should keep it for your children to read or someone else it would not mean much and after you were gone it would mean nothing no more but it's not so with the Word of God in that amazing this letter was written to the church and it means just as much today as it ever did anyone can pick it up anyone can start anywhere and start reading this story and the story has the same benefit the same value and will bring the same results as it ever has through history in fact I'm going to be presumptuous and saying I think we might well have something greater in our day because this is the manifestation the opening of the word restoration has come this word shows us so clearly we're seeing it come to pass my brother and sister all around us it's coming to pass day by day by day amen but it's not so with the Word of God it wasn't given for any individual but for every individual my words are not oh my goodness did you just read that are you with me do I need to highlight them my words are not inspired boy this sounds like confusion to apply those words correctly right there my words are not inspired you have to separate the profit from his office are you with me because there's no way you're gonna leave the profit in his office and be able to accept his words are not inspired so he's talking about a man in the flesh his words are not inspired reason I made emphasis that under some people that kind of putting brother branham on the back shelf thinking we've got more their use things like that right there deal this got a period on the end of its complete my words are not inspired but you see there miss quoting what the Prophet was really speaking he was talking about me as a man I cannot speak as it were as just a man the inspired Word of God it didn't didn't come out of him God's Word is inspired and all down through the ages every person that reads the Word of God gets a blessing out of reading it I say amen to that it does something to you it brings you in closer fellowship with God jesus said it is written that man shall not live by bread alone but by every word that proceedeth out of the mouth of God the soul of a man lives on God's Word that's what's what we're living on now imagine my brother and sister we could actually as bad as World War two the Holocaust was they starved not not just Jews in in those camps they starved all kinds of people and all kinds of different soldiers from different countries they just starved them but my brother and sister you know that individual that was inside all that wire and electricity and and guards with guns and dogs and whatever there's nothing they could do about the condition they were in being starved to death but we can be here right now my brother and sister and come to the place that if we do not get into the word we can self impose starvation on our soul Oh how could we how could we do that to our self but man does the soul of a man lives on God's Word it strengthens him the inner man and it makes us feel good to know that our souls can feed upon the good things that God has written to us I think that ought to be worthy of an amen right there it is good to know that we can feed on those things we can just take a Holtz of those things it's his letter of space to his church and it's so inspiring as we read it it does something to us that nothing else does you see what God's done my brother and sister he's left you where there's only one thing that will satisfy the inner man it's not these things of Laodicea they've got every pleasure every movie every restaurant every fine thing there is but it won't satisfy the soul of an inner man of a son or daughter of God there is only one thing that will do it and that's God's word and that's what keeps drawing you and I right back to the word day by day hardship by hardship struggle strife problems everything what happens you get drawn right back to the word now I don't say this judgmentally but it is simply a fact that we are seeing now in this season my brother and sister it's not so much about the naysayers out here I want to drive this home to you you can have people out here that are saying well we don't know if the message is true or not my brother and sister this is not our problem our problem is as we have let Satan in and he's in the process of stealing victory from us while we're distracted we're looking at entirely different direction and Satan is here stealing victory from us he's stealing healing from us while we're worried about what our 401k is doing he's stealing from us because we're caught up in little things in the church a little frictions go look up what brother Branham says about those frictions and you look at that why we're focused on all these things say is here like a thief stealing from us and we must get our focus back on the word not the world not our 401k not what we own not where we're going and going where we've been we need to get focused on the word because it's there is the only place there's life for you and I well brother Paul what are you trying to say I'm telling you Saints it's a season for us to get focused once again it's time for us to say you know what I'm not placed here to get rich I'm not placed here to have a big house a big car I'm not placed here for these things I was placed here to live the Word of God and so Lord I'm asking you this would be my prayer you can say Amen if you want yeah I am asking Lord I want you to come back and revive the inner man you say well brother Paul I feel good I'm not doing that my brother and sister I'm not saying that we're back slate I'm not saying that we're lost I'm not saying we've got problems but I can say this then I believe there's room for improvement in the spiritual life of every son and daughter of God that's in this church and here tonight there's room for us to grow room for us to step out and as we go back to the scripture to come and boldly approach my brother and sister and not not come as the beggar but come boldly to the throne of Almighty God he's given it to us let's lay claim you know I use that little reference the other day about I'll tell my daughter Jolin so I I just I don't remember why I looked on the lost claims thing for the state of Idaho and so I just typed in Hale it and oh I come across the deal about an old checking account and I thought hmm I don't remember that I don't remember nothing about those things whatever I'll go see if there's make sure it was all closed out so I go in there type inhalants of course there's a whole bunch of them all cousins and all kinds of relatives and there's my daughter Jo Lynn's name and I tell her about it and she's kinda like mm-hmm okay until she filed her little flamin found out it was pretty good chunk of money I may not like hundreds or anything my goes like 60 or $70 it all she has to do is fill out a little deal and push a button and she gets 60 or 70 dollars my brother and sister I wonder how much of God's promises we're leaving unclaimed tonight let's step up and claim it what is the reward the feast for the inner man the rejoicing that the word is opened even more than we've ever saw it before you say is that possible well let's just say this my brother and sister I've got a friend him and his wife she bears his name they live in the same house they shared the same checkbook and that's about all they've got in common can you compare that to a marriage that has the deepest of intimacy I don't believe we can sister ma would you come I think it's worth it I do let's take our level up just a little more you know the scripture says pray without ceasing I remember brother one time says you know he said I when I was a young Christian he said I read that scripture he said I'd Drive down the road but I'd also been taught you close your eyes when you pray he said I figured out those two things don't go together my brother and sister if nothing more let's pray without ceasing let's just constantly be lifting our Lord Jesus up before you know I try I don't say this boastfully but I do my very best to just start on one end of the valley and pray my way to the other in the valley and pray my way back my brother and sister because you see the greatest treasure the greatest gems the greatest friendships the greatest love that there is is not out here in the world that's within the body of Jesus Christ hallelujah oh I just want to encourage you tonight it's my whole thought my whole idea encourage you tonight take good care of the inner man feed him or feed her however you want to word it nourish bring the inner man to the place that there's nothing lacking hallelujah hallelujah well
