[38:12] as he took her by the hand
[38:15] she began to live again
[38:18] some began to praise the lord some began

[39:08] gave me life again
[39:12] i'm just a house of play
[39:15] ever since that blessed day
[39:18] there's a light that shines on me for
[39:21] all the world to see
[39:25] oh he's in the house

[41:27] he's in the house this morning
[41:30] not a house or four walls in a roof but
[41:33] you are his house this morning
[41:37] you're the house
[41:39] the one he's living in
[41:41] because he promised it
[41:43] he said i'll be with you even in you
[41:46] to the ends of the earth
[41:49] god bless you all this morning
[41:51] it's certainly an honor once again and a
[41:54] privilege
[41:55] to be here amongst the
[41:57] blood washed saints of jesus christ and
[42:01] he purchased you with his blood
[42:03] you are the purchased
[42:06] of the blood of jesus christ
[42:09] we're certainly thankful for all of that
[42:11] and uh
[42:13] this morning we
[42:15] like to
[42:16] share once again from
[42:18] from god's word and
[42:20] a little thought
[42:23] and
[42:24] i'd like to entitle that
[42:26] modern events
[42:29] made very clear yes sir by prophecy
[42:33] and um
[42:34] there was a
[42:36] rather famous person
[42:40] in england
[42:41] matter of fact
[42:43] he was king henry viii
[42:46] and they said he would make a statement
[42:49] every time he took a new wife and
[42:51] he would tell him i just want you to
[42:53] know that
[42:54] i won't be keeping you long
[42:57] it's the first statement he'd tell each
[42:59] and every one of his wives you know
[43:01] but this morning
[43:03] i just say that to say this
[43:06] my intentions are actually to keep you
[43:08] long this morning
[43:10] and i think that's the intentions of god
[43:12] unlike men of this earth where
[43:14] whether they say it or don't say it
[43:16] sometimes their intentions are just that
[43:18] with their wives with their brides but
[43:20] not not the lamb of god
[43:22] the lamb of god says to his wife my
[43:25] intentions
[43:26] are to keep you long
[43:28] like for eternity
[43:30] when he makes a vow he will not break it
[43:34] so this morning uh
[43:37] it's my intention also to to keep you
[43:39] long uh of course i'll be watchful and
[43:42] and uh see your level of attention and
[43:45] so forth and
[43:47] and uh
[43:48] which
[43:49] will certainly
[43:50] yield to that as the holy
[43:52] spirit gives us discernment here this
[43:55] morning
[43:56] if you'll stand to your feet this
[43:58] morning for the reading of the word
[44:02] like i say i'd like to
[44:03] entitle this thought
[44:05] modern events
[44:07] made very clear
[44:09] by prophecy
[44:10] and we'd like to begin reading in
[44:12] revelations chapter 5.
[44:18] and of course revelations
[44:21] 5 is one of the
[44:22] many visions that
[44:24] john the revelator had
[44:27] and
[44:28] and visions just like
[44:31] like human beings
[44:33] visions have a lifespan to them
[44:35] from the time they begin
[44:37] to the time they end
[44:39] so
[44:40] one vision might be
[44:42] fulfilled in a day
[44:45] while others unfold
[44:47] over months
[44:48] and sometimes visions take a year or two
[44:51] to unfold
[44:53] but revelations 5 here
[44:56] is probably in my opinion
[44:58] one of the longest standing visions
[45:02] because this vision begins in the book
[45:04] of genesis
[45:06] and takes us all the way
[45:09] to a rapture
[45:12] so
[45:13] for
[45:14] it's been going on now this particular
[45:17] vision
[45:18] way beyond six thousand years it's been
[45:21] unfolding
[45:22] so we'll begin here in verse one
[45:25] and i saw in the right hand of him
[45:28] that sat on a throne
[45:30] a book written within and on the
[45:32] backside
[45:34] sealed
[45:35] with seven seals
[45:37] let's pray
[45:38] heavenly father
[45:40] we thank you this morning
[45:42] that we can approach the author of the
[45:45] book
[45:46] we can knock
[45:47] this morning and it'll be open
[45:50] we can seek
[45:52] and we'll find
[45:54] so lord jesus we're doing just that this
[45:56] morning
[45:57] as we humbly bow before you

[46:02] you the lamb of god will once again open

[46:18] revelations 5 and 1
[46:20] as john said here and i saw
[46:23] so
[46:24] john was seeing what was taking place
[46:27] and
[46:28] john here was looking back all the way
[46:31] to genesis
[46:33] he was looking back and seeing
[46:36] that day
[46:37] he was seeing that moment
[46:39] when
[46:40] adam had lost
[46:42] the abstract title deed
[46:44] he was seen that that day when god was
[46:46] putting his children out of the garden
[46:50] and when he saw it
[46:52] he was giving us details
[46:55] from the point of view that he was
[46:56] seeing it that god was giving him
[46:59] that that moses had not written
[47:01] so now john is adding details to what
[47:04] happened
[47:05] in genesis
[47:07] that day in chapter 3 of genesis adding
[47:10] details that moses hadn't told us
[47:12] because moses was looking at
[47:15] brother daniel from this side
[47:17] and now john is looking from daniel from
[47:19] this side but it's the same scene
[47:22] so on this side he might see my sideburn
[47:26] was so long on that side john would say
[47:28] no it's not that long it was so long and
[47:31] yet they're both
[47:32] adding more details to make the scene
[47:35] more clear what took place
[47:37] so john from where he's looking
[47:40] 4 000 years later
[47:43] this is about 4000 bc there in genesis
[47:46] 3.
[47:47] he says and i saw in the right hand of
[47:49] him
[47:50] that sat on a throne
[47:52] a book written within and on the
[47:55] backside that adam had lost
[47:58] and this book
[48:00] was sealed with seven seals the english
[48:03] term here was you said book but it
[48:05] wasn't a book
[48:07] it was a scroll
[48:09] and it was sealed with the seal
[48:11] as they would do in times of old
[48:15] so john is looking back and he's seeing
[48:17] and watching this scene
[48:19] here in eden
[48:20] and i'll read it once again
[48:22] and i saw from the right hand of him
[48:25] that sat on the throne a book written
[48:27] within and on the backside comma
[48:31] and the comma was placed there because
[48:33] the men that transcribed the book to the
[48:36] english
[48:38] were english scholars
[48:40] perhaps master's degrees phd's
[48:43] they they they knew the english language
[48:46] quite well
[48:47] they knew the greek quite well
[48:50] and they decided where the comma should
[48:51] be placed because after the word
[48:54] backside
[48:56] so when you read it as thus
[48:58] and i saw on the right hand of him
[49:01] that sat on the throne
[49:02] a book written within on the backside it
[49:05] sounds like something is written within
[49:08] and something's written on the backside
[49:13] and then it says sealed with seven seals
[49:17] so for many years
[49:19] brother branham would read this verse
[49:23] many years as in all the way from back
[49:25] in 1953 to 1963
[49:29] and if you recall to the students of the
[49:31] bible and this message
[49:34] often brother branham's saying speaking
[49:36] of those seven thunders can believing
[49:39] that those seven thunders
[49:41] was the seven seals
[49:43] written on the backside
[49:46] and when he preached sirs what time it
[49:48] is in 1962 end of the year
[49:51] he
[49:52] he is speaking to us he's told us this
[49:54] service i'm going to be probing
[49:56] he says that may sound strange for a
[49:58] minister he said but i don't know i'm
[50:01] just wanting you to prepare you for
[50:03] something that i believe is coming
[50:06] and i want you to be ready but i'm just
[50:08] probing tonight he said
[50:11] and can he can he emphasize
[50:14] in that message
[50:15] uh seven thunders being
[50:17] those seven seals and something written
[50:19] on the backside that's right and he had
[50:21] been holding that thought since 1953.
[50:27] for 10 years
[50:28] and you can find various quotes where
[50:31] he is repeating that
[50:34] then comes 1963
[50:37] and he preaches god in
[50:38] simplicity he still holds to that
[50:41] thought
[50:43] and then comes the evening service of
[50:45] the breach
[50:47] and when he preaches the breach
[50:49] he says
[50:50] no he says
[50:52] seven thunders is not seven seals
[50:56] and there's nothing written on the
[50:58] backside
[50:59] because everything must be under the
[51:01] atonement everything must be in the book
[51:03] you can't add or take away there's
[51:06] nothing on the outside
[51:09] and if you remember more than once as
[51:11] he's preaching the seals
[51:13] he takes a roll of paper
[51:16] and he rolls it up in the first seal you
[51:18] can actually hear him rolling the paper
[51:21] and he says they didn't have a book like
[51:23] we have today
[51:24] it was a scroll
[51:26] he said then they would take wax
[51:28] put it on the end of that scroll to
[51:30] maybe take it in cigna and press it down
[51:33] in
[51:34] he said and that would seal
[51:36] the scroll
[51:38] that would seal the message that was
[51:39] within
[51:42] so
[51:43] here it says and i saw from the right
[51:45] hand of him
[51:46] that sat on the throne
[51:48] a book written within
[51:50] and on the backside comma
[51:53] grammatically correct
[51:55] but it made it prophetically wrong
[51:58] just
[51:59] by the comma
[52:00] and when brother and preach
[52:02] the the breach
[52:05] he mentally
[52:07] and he verbally as he as as he
[52:09] pronounced this word but he moved the
[52:11] comma
[52:13] because though he realized it was
[52:14] grammatically correct
[52:17] it made the significance of it
[52:19] prophetically wrong
[52:22] and a prophet read it
[52:24] differently from that day and he said
[52:26] and i saw in the right hand of him that
[52:29] sat on the throne the book written
[52:31] within
[52:32] now the emphasis he puts the comma and
[52:35] on the back side sealed with seven seals
[52:39] and what allowed him to catch that
[52:42] was when the lord revealed to them they
[52:44] didn't have books like we have today it
[52:46] was a scroll
[52:47] and the seal was on the outside but the
[52:50] message always lay on the inside of the
[52:52] scroll nothing outside of christ nothing
[52:55] outside of the word
[52:58] it's four thousand be seen
[53:00] the abstract title deed is back in the
[53:02] hands of the original owner
[53:04] almighty god
[53:06] verse two
[53:08] verse two and i saw a strong angel
[53:12] proclaiming
[53:13] it was the angel of the covenant
[53:16] you'll see that as we go down verse by
[53:18] verse
[53:19] these are not different characters
[53:21] unfolding in this vision
[53:23] this is god king morphy changing forms
[53:27] because he's descending for a work of
[53:29] redemption because he's coming down and
[53:31] can trust no one with your salvation
[53:34] he can trust no one with the hopes of
[53:36] gaining your friendship
[53:39] this is the work he's doing he himself
[53:42] is descending
[53:43] he's coming from glory and he'll go all
[53:46] the way to to the cross of calvary for
[53:48] you and i
[53:49] this is revelations 5.
[53:52] and i saw a strong angel proclaiming god
[53:57] descending
[53:59] with one purpose
[54:02] he wants to be closer
[54:05] to you
[54:09] so revelations 5 2
[54:13] revelations 1
[54:15] 4 000 bc
[54:16] revelations 5 and verse 2
[54:19] the years 1446 bc
[54:23] you see the vision
[54:25] you see how long
[54:26] it's taken to unfold
[54:28] and yet god the greatest writer and
[54:32] authors
[54:33] with it
[54:34] within nine verses
[54:36] there'll be six thousand years of
[54:38] history
[54:39] of him coming down for you and i
[54:42] what a writer god alone can write this
[54:45] way
[54:46] and then reveal it
[54:47] and open it up to us
[54:49] so here we are verse two it's 1446 bc
[54:54] the exodus has begun
[54:56] and i saw a strong angel proclaiming
[54:59] with a loud voice
[55:01] who is worthy to open the book
[55:04] and to lose the seals thereof remember
[55:06] john is an eyewitness by vision
[55:09] he has seen these things
[55:12] just as they unfolded back
[55:14] thousands of years ago
[55:18] and i saw a strong angel
[55:20] proclaiming with a loud voice
[55:22] he's going to add detail
[55:25] to what was the purpose
[55:27] of the angel of the covenant
[55:29] you say well the main purpose was the
[55:31] pillar of fire to lead israel
[55:35] out of egypt
[55:36] or the main purpose was to pass through
[55:39] the land as the death angel
[55:42] to free
[55:43] the jews from the bondage
[55:46] or the main purpose was to was to open
[55:48] the red sea and they walked through as
[55:50] on dry land
[55:53] or the main purpose was for 40 years in
[55:55] the wilderness the pillar of fire was
[55:58] with them till they entered the promised
[56:00] land
[56:02] and all that is true
[56:04] but now john
[56:06] is going to add another detail
[56:09] to the purpose of the angel of the
[56:11] covenant
[56:12] and he says
[56:13] and i saw this strong angel
[56:17] proclaiming for the loud voice the one
[56:20] who led israel out of egypt
[56:23] the one that walked them in the
[56:24] wilderness for 40 years the one that
[56:26] took them to cross
[56:28] into the promised land when i saw the
[56:31] strong angel proclaiming with a loud
[56:32] voice
[56:33] he was saying
[56:36] i heard him john said
[56:38] who is worthy to open the book
[56:40] and to loose the seals of
[56:43] detail moses didn't give us
[56:46] but now john john's adding this detail
[56:49] to this ministry of god as the angel of
[56:53] the covenant
[56:54] and for john
[56:55] this was his main purpose
[57:00] this was his main purpose
[57:02] he says then i saw a strong angel
[57:04] proclaiming with a loud voice who is
[57:06] worthy to open the book
[57:08] and to loose the seals thereof
[57:11] and no man in heaven
[57:13] nor on earth
[57:14] neither under the earth was able to open
[57:16] the book
[57:17] neither to look there on
[57:20] because everyone had been born in sin
[57:23] every one of us
[57:25] was spotted
[57:27] every one of us was unworthy
[57:31] and he says and i wept much
[57:33] because no man was found worthy
[57:36] to open
[57:37] and to read the book
[57:39] neither to look thereon
[57:42] and then he says in verse 5
[57:46] verse 5
[57:47] we're fast-forwarding now
[57:50] verse 5 is a.d 30.
[57:52] verse 5 is the first coming of christ
[57:56] verse 5 jesus begins his ministry
[58:00] as a young man
[58:01] he says and one of the elders saith unto
[58:03] me
[58:04] weep not
[58:06] behold the line of the tribe of judah
[58:09] the root of david
[58:10] have prevailed
[58:12] to open the book
[58:14] and to loose the seven seals thereof
[58:18] so now here is a question that's in this
[58:20] message are the seven seals open
[58:24] and when did they open
[58:26] some say
[58:27] no they're not open
[58:29] some say
[58:30] yes they were open
[58:34] some say it was 1963 when they first
[58:36] opened
[58:39] i say
[58:40] it was not 1963 when they first opened
[58:44] no
[58:45] i'm glad you believe it's open
[58:48] but you've missed it by about 2 000
[58:51] years
[58:52] because when the book was first opened
[58:55] and the seals were first loose
[58:57] it was jesus christ who did it
[59:00] amen
[59:01] you see the lion
[59:03] took the lion's part
[59:06] israel
[59:08] and gave the open book
[59:10] and the and the loosing of these seals
[59:13] to the firstborn son
[59:16] remember the allegory in the old
[59:17] testament
[59:19] jacob i mentioned to the night
[59:21] joseph's two sons
[59:23] kephrim and manassas
[59:25] he places them properly the eldest son
[59:28] at his right jacob's right hand and the
[59:30] youngest at his left and jacob's a blind
[59:33] old man he's at his last breaths of life
[59:37] and he's about to pray for the two boys
[59:38] and he crosses his hand
[59:40] and he gives
[59:42] the lion's share to the youngest
[59:46] instead of to the elvis
[59:48] and joseph says not so
[59:50] father
[59:53] i already properly placed them
[59:56] jacob says no son
[59:58] god crossed my hands
[1:00:00] it was an allegory
[1:00:02] that thousands of years later
[1:00:05] the lions share
[1:00:07] that belonged to israel
[1:00:09] the eldest son
[1:00:10] would be given to the youngest son
[1:00:14] the book that jesus opened the su the
[1:00:17] seals and the that he loosed in parable
[1:00:20] in matthew 24.
[1:00:24] the commandment that he gave to his
[1:00:26] twelve disciples go you to the house of
[1:00:29] israel
[1:00:30] don't go amongst the samaritans don't go
[1:00:32] to the gentiles
[1:00:34] this open book this seven seal
[1:00:36] revelation this is for the eldest this
[1:00:39] is the lion's share the lion's share
[1:00:41] goes to the eldest church
[1:00:44] not the youngest one that'll come
[1:00:47] and when the eldest rejected
[1:00:49] at the cross of calvary
[1:00:52] amen that's right the open book
[1:00:55] and the seven seal revelation went to a
[1:00:57] gentile people
[1:00:59] so here we are revelations five and five
[1:01:02] the year is a.d 30
[1:01:05] and jesus christ at his first coming
[1:01:08] has opened the first seal
[1:01:12] think of seven seals in this way
[1:01:15] okay
[1:01:16] seven parts
[1:01:18] to one divine plan of redemption
[1:01:23] seven seals
[1:01:25] seven parts
[1:01:26] to one divine plan of redemption to
[1:01:29] restore the fig tree
[1:01:31] and to restore the bride tree that's
[1:01:33] right
[1:01:34] yeah
[1:01:35] i threw that into for paul because he's
[1:01:37] a farmer you know
[1:01:39] start talking about trees
[1:01:43] so here
[1:01:45] the book that adam lost
[1:01:48] the lion took the lion's share
[1:01:50] to israel and israel rejected it
[1:01:54] the year revelations 5 and 5
[1:01:57] is a.d 30.
[1:01:59] verse 6
[1:02:01] can i be held and low in the midst of
[1:02:03] the throne
[1:02:04] and of the four beasts and of the midst
[1:02:07] of the elder
[1:02:08] stood a lamb is that had been slain
[1:02:10] having seven horns and seven eyes
[1:02:13] which are the seven spirits of god
[1:02:16] sent forth into all the earth from verse
[1:02:18] five to verse 6
[1:02:21] three years has just gone by
[1:02:24] from the beginning of his ministry to
[1:02:26] the day of crucifixion
[1:02:28] three three and a half years
[1:02:31] and the lamb
[1:02:33] john sees the lamb now
[1:02:36] john sees the lion jesus christ now
[1:02:40] as jesus christ the lamb
[1:02:44] god didn't change forms now
[1:02:47] but at gethsemane
[1:02:49] jesus walked in king of the jews
[1:02:52] lying of the tribe of israel
[1:02:54] and when jesus walked out
[1:02:56] after one hour of prayer
[1:02:58] he walked out the lamb of god
[1:03:00] savior of the whole world
[1:03:06] one hour
[1:03:09] in five minutes
[1:03:10] god can change your life
[1:03:14] but from the time you walked in this
[1:03:16] morning to the time you walk out
[1:03:20] you tell him what's in your heart you be
[1:03:22] praying as we're speaking to you the
[1:03:23] word of god
[1:03:25] because he can change your desires
[1:03:27] completely
[1:03:28] he can make you new again
[1:03:31] amen
[1:03:34] so verse 6
[1:03:35] a.d 33 a.d 44. can i be held and low in
[1:03:39] the midst of the throne and of the four
[1:03:41] beasts
[1:03:42] and in the midst of the elders stood a
[1:03:44] lamb as had been slain
[1:03:46] having seven horns and seven eyes which
[1:03:49] are the seven spirits of god
[1:03:51] sent forth
[1:03:52] into all the world
[1:03:54] the years a.d 33
[1:03:57] 34
[1:03:59] crucifixion day
[1:04:03] from verse 1 to verse 6
[1:04:06] over 4 000 years god covered
[1:04:11] him descending
[1:04:13] god changing forms
[1:04:15] but in verse 6
[1:04:16] he didn't change forms
[1:04:18] he changed ministry
[1:04:21] from lion
[1:04:22] to lamb of god
[1:04:26] he was always the lamb of god but he
[1:04:28] didn't enter the ministry right till
[1:04:30] this spot
[1:04:31] why he was the lamb slain at the
[1:04:34] foundation of the world for adam and eve
[1:04:37] and the skins that god created
[1:04:41] because god didn't kill
[1:04:43] anything for those skins
[1:04:47] by the spoken word he created these
[1:04:49] skins to dress his son and his daughter
[1:04:52] to cover them
[1:04:54] with the skins of the lamb
[1:04:56] that in his mind
[1:04:58] he had slain
[1:05:00] to cover them with
[1:05:03] so the skins that he created
[1:05:06] represented
[1:05:08] himself as the lamb of god
[1:05:11] and he covered adam and eve
[1:05:14] with these
[1:05:15] spoken word skins
[1:05:17] representing the covering of the blood
[1:05:19] of the sacrifice
[1:05:21] of the lamb of god
[1:05:23] in genesis
[1:05:25] revelation 13 8 says
[1:05:27] he was the lamb slain
[1:05:30] not before the foundation but at the
[1:05:32] foundation
[1:05:34] matter of fact in genesis 3
[1:05:37] in the year 4000
[1:05:39] the lamb was slain the sacrifice was
[1:05:41] made in the mind of god
[1:05:46] verse 7.
[1:05:50] and he came
[1:05:51] and took the book
[1:05:53] out of the right hand of him that sat
[1:05:55] upon the throne
[1:05:58] verse 7 8-9
[1:06:01] is now the second coming of christ
[1:06:05] this is a proof this is prophecy
[1:06:08] this is vision
[1:06:09] this is how quickly the scene can change
[1:06:12] in the prophetic word
[1:06:14] a comma a period a dot a space a word
[1:06:21] just like in malachi 4 6 remember
[1:06:26] behold
[1:06:27] i'll send you elijah the prophet
[1:06:29] before the great and terrible day of the
[1:06:31] lord
[1:06:32] and he
[1:06:34] will turn the hearts of the fathers
[1:06:36] to the children
[1:06:38] comma

[1:06:50] one comma yeah that's right 2 000 years
[1:06:52] later
[1:06:54] so without revelation
[1:06:56] who can read this book and understand
[1:06:59] and if you're catching it and
[1:07:00] understanding
[1:07:02] know this
[1:07:03] that it's the it's the holy spirit it's
[1:07:06] the lamb of god opening the eyes of your
[1:07:09] understanding here this morning
[1:07:12] this isn't natural it's supernatural
[1:07:14] what's taking place right now in your
[1:07:16] heart in your mind
[1:07:22] and he came and took the book
[1:07:25] out of the right hand of him
[1:07:27] that sat upon the throne
[1:07:30] the date changes again
[1:07:32] revelations 5 and 7
[1:07:38] february the 28th
[1:07:40] 1963. that's right
[1:07:45] we'll share more detail on it
[1:07:47] don't be scared i'm your friend
[1:07:49] i'm non-violent i'm just here to share
[1:07:52] the word
[1:07:53] are you listening this morning
[1:07:55] and he came and took the book out of the
[1:07:57] right hand of him
[1:07:59] that sat upon the todom
[1:08:01] february the 28th
[1:08:03] 1963 yes sir
[1:08:07] then it repeats
[1:08:08] and when he had taken the book here he
[1:08:10] told us he took the book
[1:08:16] revelation 7
[1:08:18] february the 28th 1963
[1:08:21] is when they ch
[1:08:23] snapped the picture of the cloud that's
[1:08:25] right
[1:08:26] on sunset mountains
[1:08:29] and when he had taken the book
[1:08:32] he took the book but now it's saying and
[1:08:34] when you're taking the book
[1:08:38] that
[1:08:40] was march 17 1963
[1:08:43] and when he had taken the book
[1:08:46] not only was that march 17 1963
[1:08:51] okay but that was jeffersonville indiana
[1:08:53] yes sir
[1:08:55] and when he had taken the book
[1:08:57] the four beasts and the four and twenty
[1:08:59] elders fell down before the lamb
[1:09:01] having every one of them harps and
[1:09:03] golden vials full of voters
[1:09:06] which are the prayers of the saints
[1:09:08] and they sung a new song
[1:09:11] they'd never sung the song before this
[1:09:13] was new
[1:09:14] because revelation was falling
[1:09:17] inspiration was coming down
[1:09:20] they sang a new song
[1:09:22] saying thou art worthy to take the book
[1:09:26] and to open the seals thereof
[1:09:28] i thought
[1:09:29] revelations 5 said he had already opened
[1:09:32] the book and the seals he did
[1:09:35] that was the first coming
[1:09:37] that was the line with the line shared
[1:09:40] to israel
[1:09:42] but now
[1:09:43] the lamb takes the book again
[1:09:46] because this is the second coming of
[1:09:47] christ
[1:09:49] this is the lamb taking the lamb's part
[1:09:51] to the bride of jesus christ to a
[1:09:54] mystical body to the church here in
[1:09:56] idaho
[1:09:59] and they sung a new song
[1:10:02] the brothers and grandpa
[1:10:03] saying thou art worthy to take the book
[1:10:05] into the open the seals thereof for thou
[1:10:08] was slain amen
[1:10:10] not william branham
[1:10:12] not the apostle paul
[1:10:14] not moses
[1:10:15] not adam not abel
[1:10:17] not paul not daniel
[1:10:19] the lamb of god
[1:10:21] opened the book in 1963
[1:10:24] the lamb of god revealed the word in
[1:10:26] jeffersonville indiana
[1:10:28] he had a vessel he had a trumpet
[1:10:31] but it was this is god
[1:10:34] from verse 1 to verse 9 of revelations 5
[1:10:37] this is god changing forms
[1:10:40] and changing ministry
[1:10:42] and they sang a new song saying thou art
[1:10:44] worthy you take the book and to open the
[1:10:46] seals thereof for thou a slain has
[1:10:49] redeemed us to god by thy blood out of
[1:10:51] every kindred and tongue
[1:10:54] and people
[1:10:56] and nation
[1:10:59] verses 7 8 9
[1:11:01] the seventh seal was loosed
[1:11:04] what did the seven seals lose what did
[1:11:06] the seven seal loose
[1:11:09] six other seals and the revelation of it
[1:11:11] were hidden under the seventh seal
[1:11:16] so here we are
[1:11:18] verse seven eight and nine
[1:11:21] three verses
[1:11:23] three verses represents
[1:11:25] from march the 28th
[1:11:29] from february the 28th
[1:11:32] to march the 24th yes
[1:11:34] 25 days
[1:11:38] now i'd like for you to turn with me
[1:11:41] to revelations
[1:11:44] 8 and 1.
[1:11:49] we're going to let our fingers do the
[1:11:51] walking
[1:11:52] through the bible pages is what we want
[1:11:54] to do
[1:11:55] revelations
[1:11:57] 8-1
[1:11:59] it reads like this
[1:12:02] and when he had opened the seventh seal
[1:12:04] there was silence in heaven
[1:12:06] about the space of half an hour
[1:12:09] that's all it said
[1:12:12] and they say but the daniel
[1:12:15] that's all he said
[1:12:19] what in the world will you make out of
[1:12:20] that it's best to say nothing isn't it
[1:12:24] it's best to be quiet isn't it
[1:12:28] it's best to not get out on a limb with
[1:12:31] these things they tell us
[1:12:35] in 1963 in the mystery in the message
[1:12:38] christ the mystery of god revealed
[1:12:40] brother branham says this and in
[1:12:42] paragraph 6 37
[1:12:46] he says
[1:12:47] not knowing of course but being
[1:12:49] spiritual
[1:12:50] you watch spiritual things
[1:12:53] not knowing this god knows it
[1:12:56] but if you'll turn and look at the clock
[1:12:59] he says it's on the dot two o'clock
[1:13:03] and everyone in the room could look and
[1:13:06] look at the clock and
[1:13:07] yeah it's two o'clock
[1:13:10] and then brother and says
[1:13:12] the end of the second poll
[1:13:15] he wanted them to be partakers
[1:13:19] of something god was doing right then
[1:13:22] that moment
[1:13:24] he wanted him to get caught up in the
[1:13:26] spirit
[1:13:27] he says it's the end of the second pull
[1:13:30] the third pool
[1:13:32] is at hand amen
[1:13:34] revelations 8 1
[1:13:37] and when he had opened the seventh seal
[1:13:40] there was silence in heaven
[1:13:43] about the space of half an hour
[1:13:47] brother and i made a statement
[1:13:50] because that's just one verse
[1:13:53] for the whole seal
[1:13:56] one verse and not a whole lot to it
[1:13:59] as he himself declared there's not a
[1:14:02] matter of fact he said there's really
[1:14:03] nothing said about it that's right
[1:14:06] but in 1964
[1:14:09] feast of the trumpets
[1:14:11] he told us revelations 10
[1:14:14] was the seventh seal yes that's exactly
[1:14:16] right so what does that mean to us then
[1:14:20] that means that all of a sudden the
[1:14:22] seventh seal doesn't have just one verse
[1:14:24] that's right
[1:14:25] now it's got 11 verses plus one now
[1:14:29] there's 12 verses of detail
[1:14:33] so that we can see and try to and
[1:14:35] recognize our day and its message
[1:14:38] it's not one verse no more
[1:14:40] he said look i want to say one more
[1:14:42] thing closely now don't miss this how
[1:14:44] striking from the seventh angels he said
[1:14:47] messenger of the seven seal message
[1:14:49] in revelations 10
[1:14:51] was the seventh seal that's right
[1:14:56] so he's telling us
[1:14:57] there's a lot more detail yes to this
[1:15:00] seventh seal
[1:15:02] and if you want to know more about it
[1:15:04] read revelations 10.
[1:15:08] because revelations 10 was the seventh
[1:15:11] seal it's 1964.
[1:15:13] july
[1:15:15] the 19th in the morning
[1:15:21] there was a magazine called science
[1:15:23] magazine there in arizona put out by the
[1:15:26] university of arizona and the the head
[1:15:29] scientist was james e mcdonnell
[1:15:33] and in that magazine
[1:15:35] he writes this
[1:15:37] he said an unusual ring-shaped cloud was
[1:15:40] widely absorbed over northern arizona
[1:15:42] near sunset on the 28th of february
[1:15:44] 1963.
[1:15:46] from a large number of observers reports
[1:15:50] it is known to have appeared overhead
[1:15:52] near flagstaff arizona it says from
[1:15:54] initial computations based on four
[1:15:56] photos taken in tucson
[1:15:59] 190 miles south of the cloud its
[1:16:02] altitude was approximately 35 kilometers
[1:16:05] the most distant observation reported
[1:16:08] was 280 miles from the cloud
[1:16:11] he said the cloud remained
[1:16:14] sunlit for 28 minutes after local sunset
[1:16:18] now god
[1:16:20] has science to add another detail
[1:16:24] to revelations 8 1.
[1:16:26] in revelations 8 8 1
[1:16:28] john said
[1:16:30] that when the seventh seal opened
[1:16:33] there was silence in heaven
[1:16:35] about the space of ethanol
[1:16:39] but now we realize
[1:16:41] god adds more detail
[1:16:43] and he causes
[1:16:44] the scientific world to tell us
[1:16:47] that the reason john said
[1:16:49] it was about a half hour
[1:16:51] because it was actually 28 minutes
[1:17:03] he said the cloud remained sunlit for 28
[1:17:05] minutes
[1:17:06] after local
[1:17:08] sunset
[1:17:09] the senate said amen the cloud remained
[1:17:13] sunlit
[1:17:14] for 28 minutes
[1:17:16] science telling us this
[1:17:18] he says
[1:17:19] he said
[1:17:20] everything is
[1:17:23] the cloud remains sunlit for 28 minutes
[1:17:25] after local sunset iridescent
[1:17:27] iridescence was noted by many absorbers
[1:17:30] tentatively the cloud may be regarded as
[1:17:33] similar to on narcrescious cloud
[1:17:37] but it's used but it's unusually great
[1:17:39] high
[1:17:40] and unusually low altitude plus its
[1:17:43] remarkable shape suggests
[1:17:46] that it was a cloud of previously
[1:17:49] unrecorded
[1:17:51] type
[1:17:55] unrecorded of science
[1:17:59] and yet
[1:18:00] it was previously recorded
[1:18:05] just the scientists
[1:18:07] will not go back to the data sheets of
[1:18:10] god to see who was recorded before
[1:18:14] in acts 1
[1:18:16] verses 7
[1:18:17] to 11.
[1:18:19] that's it
[1:18:20] it reads like this verse 7
[1:18:23] and he said unto them it's not for you
[1:18:25] to know the times or the seasons which
[1:18:27] the father has put in his own power
[1:18:30] jesus speaking to his disciples he's
[1:18:32] about to ascend
[1:18:34] he's a he's been with them for 40 days
[1:18:37] he's going to give them a commission
[1:18:39] to terry in jerusalem he's about to
[1:18:41] ascend
[1:18:42] he said he said unto he said both but ye
[1:18:45] shall receive power verse 8 after that
[1:18:47] the holy ghost has come upon you and you
[1:18:49] shall be witnesses unto me both in
[1:18:51] jerusalem and all judea and samaria come
[1:18:54] to the uttermost parts of the earth
[1:18:57] and when he had spoken these things
[1:18:58] while they beheld he was taken up
[1:19:01] and a cloud received them out of their
[1:19:03] sight
[1:19:04] can while they look steadfastly toward
[1:19:06] heaven as he went behold two men stood
[1:19:09] by them in white apparel
[1:19:11] which also said to yemen of galilee
[1:19:15] why stand ye gazing up into heaven
[1:19:17] this same jesus which is taken up from
[1:19:20] you into heaven shall so come in like
[1:19:23] manner as you have seen him go
[1:19:27] so now
[1:19:29] so now
[1:19:31] what happened on february the 28th adds
[1:19:34] detail to what took place
[1:19:36] here in jerusalem
[1:19:39] that there wasn't a cloud that received
[1:19:41] them up that was the same seven angels
[1:19:45] and the way they took him is the way
[1:19:47] he's come back in our day again
[1:19:51] amen that's the truth
[1:19:53] isaiah 28
[1:19:55] verse 9 and 10 says
[1:19:57] whom shall he teach knowledge
[1:20:00] and whom shall be made to understand
[1:20:02] doctrine
[1:20:03] them that are weaned from the milk
[1:20:06] and drawn from the best that's it
[1:20:09] amen that's right them that have been
[1:20:11] born again
[1:20:14] it's spoken in a mystery
[1:20:16] it's spoken in a parable it's an
[1:20:18] allegory
[1:20:25] turn with me to revelations 10
[1:20:28] verses 1 and 2.
[1:20:35] revelations 10 verse 1 and 2
[1:20:39] john again
[1:20:40] an eyewitness of these things by vision
[1:20:44] and he said and i saw another mighty
[1:20:48] angel come down from heaven
[1:20:51] clothed with a cloud there it is there
[1:20:53] it is there's the seven angels
[1:20:56] can a rainbow was upon his head
[1:20:59] and his face was it were the sun
[1:21:02] and his feet as pillars of fire
[1:21:05] and you look at the
[1:21:07] magazine life magazine if anyone has it
[1:21:11] i happen to have two you know
[1:21:15] and when you look at that picture of the
[1:21:17] cloud
[1:21:19] it's in the last pages or the back of
[1:21:21] the magazine
[1:21:23] you see the shape you turn it to the
[1:21:25] right
[1:21:26] the face of christ
[1:21:29] but there's no rainbow there
[1:21:36] brother dave come on let me say it
[1:21:42] i forgive you see he took my thunder
[1:21:44] from me
[1:21:45] no pun intended but
[1:21:50] so in fact it is
[1:21:52] on the backside of that picture
[1:21:55] of the cloud
[1:21:56] you turn back
[1:21:58] and it's a photograph that was taken on
[1:22:00] one of the hawaiian islands
[1:22:03] and it's a picture of a rainbow
[1:22:06] but they call it a moonlit rainbow
[1:22:09] that's right
[1:22:10] because the picture was taken
[1:22:12] at 11 o'clock at night
[1:22:16] 11th hour
[1:22:18] very rare
[1:22:20] i don't know of any other pictures of a
[1:22:22] moonlight rain they've been seen before
[1:22:25] but photographed
[1:22:27] it was so
[1:22:28] outstanding
[1:22:30] that a photographer in hawaii happened
[1:22:32] to be at the right place the right time
[1:22:35] with the right
[1:22:36] equipment to snap that photo
[1:22:39] and here
[1:22:40] is a is a rainbow
[1:22:43] at night
[1:22:46] and
[1:22:48] they took that rainbow picture
[1:22:50] and they put it on the back
[1:22:52] side page
[1:22:54] of the cloud picture
[1:22:58] and when you pick that page up to the
[1:23:00] light
[1:23:02] and the light shines through it
[1:23:05] you see a rainbow over the head of
[1:23:07] christ
[1:23:11] and i saw another mighty angel come down
[1:23:13] from heaven
[1:23:15] clothed with a cloud
[1:23:16] and a rainbow was upon his head
[1:23:19] and science took the picture
[1:23:22] and life magazine documented can his
[1:23:25] face was or as it were the sun
[1:23:29] because it was a face when you turn it
[1:23:31] to the right
[1:23:33] and his feet
[1:23:34] as pillars of fire
[1:23:37] verse two and he had in his hand a
[1:23:39] little book open
[1:23:41] and he set his right foot upon the sea
[1:23:44] and his left foot
[1:23:46] on the earth and modern events
[1:23:49] are being made very clear
[1:23:52] by prophecy
[1:23:54] in the message modern events but ram
[1:23:57] preached in 1965
[1:23:59] paragraph 61
[1:24:01] he says these modern events is slipping
[1:24:04] by us too swiftly
[1:24:06] and one day we're going to find out
[1:24:07] we'll be left behind without nothing can
[1:24:10] be caught sealed into the mark of the
[1:24:12] beast before we know it
[1:24:14] now
[1:24:15] and with patience we have to wait for
[1:24:17] this for the prophecies that's promised
[1:24:20] every one of them must be fulfilled in
[1:24:22] this age for it foretells us the author
[1:24:25] has before done this
[1:24:27] and we wait to see him do it again what
[1:24:29] a time it is that we're living in
[1:24:31] something like a calendar you look at a
[1:24:33] calendar to find out what day of the
[1:24:35] year you're living in can you look at
[1:24:37] god's bibles to see what age we're
[1:24:39] living in we're not living in the method
[1:24:41] age the baptist age
[1:24:44] did he say the laodicean age he did not
[1:24:47] he said
[1:24:49] the bright age
[1:24:50] that's right
[1:24:52] and and men in this message good men
[1:24:56] with a big period under revelation they
[1:24:59] say no no no there's only seven church
[1:25:02] ages
[1:25:03] like as screaming to the prophet saying
[1:25:05] don't do this to me
[1:25:07] don't you know i've preached seven
[1:25:08] church ages for 40 years now and then
[1:25:11] this quote pops up
[1:25:14] he says he said we're living in the
[1:25:16] bride age the calling
[1:25:17] bringing back to god through a channel
[1:25:19] that he promised to bring it back in he
[1:25:22] promised
[1:25:23] to do it
[1:25:25] in the message this day the scriptures
[1:25:27] fulfilled
[1:25:28] brother branham says seven angels said
[1:25:32] the seven seals of the seven mysteries
[1:25:34] will be open
[1:25:35] and then he said this day
[1:25:38] this scriptures is fulfilled
[1:25:41] right i'll read it yes sir
[1:25:43] he said here can we here we are today
[1:25:46] understanding serpency
[1:25:48] can a few days of god willing
[1:25:50] we'll understand the correctness of
[1:25:52] marriage and divorce and all these
[1:25:54] things that god has opened every seal
[1:25:58] the mystery since the foundation of the
[1:26:00] world we've been enjoying the presence
[1:26:02] of his blessing that's true this day
[1:26:05] this scripture amen fulfilled
[1:26:12] revelations 10 is not just
[1:26:15] the seventh seal as he told us
[1:26:18] revelations 10
[1:26:19] it's his coming
[1:26:21] it's his second coming amen to the bride
[1:26:24] of jesus christ
[1:26:26] he says
[1:26:27] now he says now it's wrote mysterious
[1:26:30] because no man nowhere knows it the
[1:26:32] breach 1963
[1:26:35] god alone jesus christ see but
[1:26:37] it is a book a mysterious book it's a
[1:26:39] book of redemption we'll get into that
[1:26:41] in a little while and now we know that
[1:26:43] this book of redemption will be
[1:26:45] thoroughly understood will not be
[1:26:47] thoroughly understood it's probed that
[1:26:49] through six church ages but at the end
[1:26:52] when the seventh angel begins to sound
[1:26:54] his mystery he winds up all the loose
[1:26:56] ends that these fellows probed at and
[1:26:58] the mysteries come down from god as the
[1:27:00] word of god reveals the entire
[1:27:02] revelation of god then the godhead and
[1:27:05] everything else is settled all the
[1:27:07] mysteries serpent seed and whatever more
[1:27:09] is to be revealed
[1:27:11] now you see
[1:27:12] i'm not just making that up
[1:27:14] it's thus
[1:27:16] saith the lord
[1:27:17] i'll read it to you out of the book the
[1:27:19] sounding of the seventh angels message
[1:27:21] the mystery of god should be finished
[1:27:23] that's been declared by his holy
[1:27:24] prophets that's the prophets who wrote
[1:27:27] the word
[1:27:28] at the sounding of the seven church age
[1:27:31] the last church age all those loose ends
[1:27:34] that through these church ages have been
[1:27:35] probed at will be wound up together
[1:27:38] and when the seals are broke
[1:27:41] and the mystery is revealed
[1:27:43] down comes the angel the messenger
[1:27:45] christ
[1:27:46] setting his foot upon the land
[1:27:48] upon the sea with a rainbow over his
[1:27:50] head now remember

[1:28:59] seals of god when it was opened there in
[1:29:01] the mountain lit god no let me die right

[1:29:05] truth i foretold you even a year and six
[1:29:08] months before it happened

[1:29:15] and what would happen out there in the
[1:29:16] desert and there's men sitting here
[1:29:18] right now tonight was standing there and
[1:29:20] present when the seven angels came down
[1:29:22] amen
[1:29:23] and even the magazine life packed the
[1:29:25] article of it it's right there in the
[1:29:27] observatory and everything now they
[1:29:29] don't even know
[1:29:31] what it's all
[1:29:32] about
[1:29:35] but you know
[1:29:36] yes
[1:29:38] because the secret things belong to you
[1:29:40] that's exactly right
[1:29:44] the cloud was photographed
[1:29:47] on february the 28th
[1:29:49] 1963.
[1:29:51] march 17 1963
[1:29:54] william branham begins the sounding
[1:29:57] part of the ministry
[1:29:59] he begins the sounding of the seventh
[1:30:01] angel
[1:30:02] ministry
[1:30:03] with god and simplicity
[1:30:05] march 24th
[1:30:07] he preaches the seventh seal
[1:30:12] so from february the 28th
[1:30:16] to march the 24th fourth
[1:30:19] it's 25 days
[1:30:21] so from the appearing of the cloud
[1:30:23] to the preaching of the seven seals
[1:30:26] 25 days
[1:30:29] in prophecy
[1:30:31] but took place on sunset mountain is
[1:30:34] revelations 10 1.
[1:30:36] amen and in prophecy what took place in
[1:30:39] jeffersonville indiana
[1:30:41] was revelations 10 7. amen so
[1:30:45] those seven verses
[1:30:46] of revelations 10 from verse 1
[1:30:50] to verse 7.
[1:30:52] you know how long it took for god to
[1:30:54] unfold it
[1:30:55] 25 days amen
[1:30:58] amen
[1:31:00] think about it
[1:31:03] from revelations 10 1
[1:31:06] a prophecy that has sat for 2 000 years
[1:31:10] god unfolds it in 25 days
[1:31:14] what was it
[1:31:15] it was the third pool ministry amen
[1:31:19] that he continued to the end of his life
[1:31:20] in 1965.
[1:31:22] he didn't go back to the second poll
[1:31:25] as many wanted him to
[1:31:28] he didn't go back from the first poll as
[1:31:30] even more wanted him to
[1:31:32] no god said third poll that's it
[1:31:36] the revealing of the word
[1:31:39] the character building time for the
[1:31:40] bride of jesus christ
[1:31:43] to teach her how to handle the spoken
[1:31:45] word
[1:31:46] to increase her faith
[1:31:49] in the prophecies
[1:31:52] of her life
[1:31:54] so that she can be quickened
[1:31:56] changed translated by the power of the
[1:31:58] holy spirit
[1:32:00] revelations 10 1-7
[1:32:04] 25 days
[1:32:07] amen and god unfolds it brings it to
[1:32:09] pass
[1:32:10] it's history now amen
[1:32:15] but there's a few verses left
[1:32:17] in the seventh seal of revelations 10.
[1:32:20] it's 8 to 11.
[1:32:24] in the message the first seal
[1:32:26] 1963 brother branham
[1:32:29] he says the seals has done been broke he
[1:32:31] says
[1:32:32] matter of fact because he's preaching
[1:32:33] the first shield he says why we're
[1:32:35] breaking them now
[1:32:38] they were they were open there on the
[1:32:40] mountain yes
[1:32:44] but now the lamb has taken the book
[1:32:47] and we're in jeffersonville indiana
[1:32:50] and he's loosing the revelation
[1:32:54] watch
[1:32:55] paragraph 195 the first seal now then
[1:32:57] reformers know there was something wrong
[1:33:00] luther knowed that that the bread wasn't
[1:33:02] the body of christ and so he preached
[1:33:05] that just shall live by faith
[1:33:08] and that was his message and when john
[1:33:10] wesley came along he saw that there was
[1:33:12] sanctification so he preached
[1:33:14] sanctification that was his message see
[1:33:17] the pentecostals brought in the message
[1:33:19] of the holy ghost and so forth but in
[1:33:21] the days
[1:33:22] in the last days the messenger is not to
[1:33:24] start any reformation but is to take all
[1:33:26] the mysteries that these reformers left
[1:33:28] off gather them together solve them to
[1:33:31] the people
[1:33:32] let me just read it again it sounds so
[1:33:34] good to me i like to read it he says
[1:33:38] i like to read it
[1:33:41] he ain't god ain't king henry viii it's
[1:33:43] the lamb of god he's planning to keep
[1:33:45] you long maybe even this morning he's
[1:33:48] still planning that
[1:33:52] but in the last days from this last age
[1:33:54] the messengers not to start any
[1:33:55] reformation but is to take all the
[1:33:58] mysteries that these reformers left off
[1:34:00] gather them together solve them to the
[1:34:01] people let me just read it again it
[1:34:04] sounds so good to me i like to read it
[1:34:08] believers
[1:34:12] two in the bed
[1:34:13] two men
[1:34:14] two women grinding
[1:34:16] at the mill
[1:34:17] to men in the field
[1:34:20] both of them
[1:34:22] wise and foolish amen they like reading
[1:34:25] it
[1:34:26] this precious bible
[1:34:28] over
[1:34:29] and over
[1:34:30] and over
[1:34:31] until god opens it up to you
[1:34:34] the parables
[1:34:36] and when he comes
[1:34:38] he'll speak in parables and without a
[1:34:40] parable he won't see a word
[1:34:44] but in parables he will speak things
[1:34:46] that have been hid since the foundation
[1:34:48] of the world
[1:34:50] in parables he was speaking things that
[1:34:52] only the ears of adam had ever heard
[1:34:58] like this one thing that he repeated
[1:35:01] often to adam
[1:35:07] it just so happens
[1:35:09] i know what
[1:35:10] he said to
[1:35:12] adam he said this adam
[1:35:16] the works that i do
[1:35:18] shall you do also amen and greater than
[1:35:21] these
[1:35:23] for i go to the father
[1:35:25] you say oh no brother bro brother john
[1:35:28] brother daniel
[1:35:29] i'm a bible reader that's saint john 14
[1:35:32] and 12. that's not the old testament
[1:35:36] but you see god's word
[1:35:39] is eternal amen
[1:35:43] what he said there
[1:35:44] wasn't the first time he said it
[1:35:47] but what he said there
[1:35:49] was a time now that he was determined
[1:35:52] for you to be the one
[1:35:54] to fulfill that part
[1:35:57] then he was speaking to adam
[1:36:00] this morning he's speaking to you
[1:36:08] revelations 10
[1:36:10] verse 3 and 4.
[1:36:13] and cried with a loud voice
[1:36:16] that's when a lion born
[1:36:18] and when he had cried
[1:36:20] seven thunders uttered their
[1:36:23] and when the seven thunders had uttered
[1:36:25] their voices
[1:36:27] i was about to write
[1:36:29] and i heard a voice from heaven saying
[1:36:30] unto me
[1:36:31] seal up those things with the seven
[1:36:34] thunders uttered
[1:36:35] and write them not
[1:36:39] now
[1:36:40] the big thing in a debate is this
[1:36:47] it's not written
[1:36:50] plain and simple it's not written
[1:36:52] brother daniel
[1:36:54] so there you have it guy
[1:36:58] what are you going to do with that one
[1:37:01] i say
[1:37:02] well
[1:37:03] before he said it's not written
[1:37:05] he said it was spoken
[1:37:08] that's right and his spoken word will
[1:37:10] not return boy that's right
[1:37:12] it was by the spoken word that he
[1:37:14] created heavens and earth
[1:37:17] and that part wasn't written until a
[1:37:20] thousand years later when moses wrote it
[1:37:23] so long before it was written it was
[1:37:25] spoken
[1:37:26] and came to pass
[1:37:29] the spoken word amen
[1:37:32] is what brings things to pass
[1:37:34] the written word
[1:37:37] he does that for us
[1:37:41] but he don't need his word written
[1:37:44] to bring it to pass in your life
[1:37:50] the thunder
[1:37:53] i'm going to say the thunder
[1:37:55] was the voice of god when the seal
[1:37:57] opened
[1:37:58] amen and the reason i'm going to say it
[1:38:00] is because he said it in the first seal
[1:38:03] you know that thank you brother dave you
[1:38:05] didn't jump on that one
[1:38:07] you take my thunder again
[1:38:09] thank you sir this man's a gentleman
[1:38:12] i love him
[1:38:14] first seal
[1:38:15] paragraph 263 we found what the thunder
[1:38:18] means
[1:38:19] that's perfectly we know that see the
[1:38:22] thunder was the voice of god
[1:38:24] when the seal opened
[1:38:27] amen
[1:38:29] in saint john 12
[1:38:30] the brandon reads it when he preaches
[1:38:32] the first seal
[1:38:33] and he said and the people heard
[1:38:36] as though it had thundered
[1:38:38] some said it was a voice
[1:38:41] but what it was
[1:38:42] was the first seal
[1:38:44] opening that's right in the days of
[1:38:46] jesus at the first coming
[1:38:49] part one
[1:38:51] of seven parts
[1:38:52] of one divine plan to restore the bride
[1:38:56] tree to restore the fig tree to restore
[1:38:59] you to restore me
[1:39:02] to restore a mystical body of jesus
[1:39:04] christ
[1:39:09] seven seals i gotta tell you that
[1:39:12] seven seals
[1:39:13] that's what the thunder was about amen
[1:39:16] and i gotta tell you that because that's
[1:39:18] what he also said
[1:39:20] questions and answers 1964.
[1:39:24] brother brown says have the seven
[1:39:26] thunders they ask him the question
[1:39:28] which equals seven minutes mysteries
[1:39:32] already been revealed
[1:39:33] were they revealed in the seven seals
[1:39:35] but are
[1:39:36] yet not known to us as the thunders yet
[1:39:40] the other man says
[1:39:41] no
[1:39:43] they were revealed in the seven seals
[1:39:45] that's what the thunders was about
[1:39:48] the seven thunders that had uttered
[1:39:50] their voices that no one could make out
[1:39:52] what it was
[1:39:53] john knew what it was
[1:39:55] but he was forbidden to write it he said
[1:39:58] but the seventh angel
[1:40:00] in the days of his sounding
[1:40:02] the seven mysteries of the seven
[1:40:03] thunders would be revealed and the
[1:40:05] seventh angel is the messenger
[1:40:08] of the seven church ages
[1:40:15] so revelations 10
[1:40:18] what is it
[1:40:21] it's
[1:40:22] it's the seven seals
[1:40:25] revelation is 10 what is it it's the
[1:40:27] bright age
[1:40:29] revelations 10 what is it it's his
[1:40:31] coming to the bride
[1:40:34] revelations 10 what is it it's the
[1:40:36] sounding of the seventh angel
[1:40:38] it's his third paul ministry the
[1:40:40] revealing of the word amen
[1:40:44] what is revelations 10
[1:40:46] it's a heart turning time
[1:40:49] not a time of information
[1:40:52] not education
[1:40:53] revelation is a personal experience with
[1:40:56] a father made possible through the blood
[1:40:59] of jesus
[1:41:02] christ seven thunders
[1:41:06] will turn the hearts of the children
[1:41:08] to the fathers
[1:41:12] in the next in the exposition of the
[1:41:14] seven church ages
[1:41:16] let me read you this
[1:41:19] now this messenger of malachi 4
[1:41:22] and revelations 10 7
[1:41:24] is going to do
[1:41:26] two things
[1:41:30] two things one
[1:41:33] according to malachi 4
[1:41:35] he'll turn the hearts of the children to
[1:41:36] the fathers
[1:41:38] two
[1:41:39] he will reveal the mysteries of the
[1:41:41] seven thunders in revelations 10
[1:41:43] which are the revelations contained
[1:41:46] in the seven seals
[1:41:48] it will be these divinely revealed
[1:41:50] mystery truths
[1:41:51] that literally turn the hearts of the
[1:41:53] children
[1:41:55] to the pentecostal fathers
[1:42:03] standing in the gap 1963
[1:42:07] three months after he preached the seals
[1:42:10] he says this in paragraph 80.
[1:42:12] well it happens to be
[1:42:15] that at least one man is present this
[1:42:17] morning
[1:42:18] who was standing there when it happened
[1:42:21] it actually took the rocks off the
[1:42:22] mountain we find out that during that
[1:42:25] time
[1:42:26] i saw seven angels in the form of a
[1:42:28] pyramid
[1:42:29] that swept down and picked me up i was
[1:42:31] brought east to open the seven seals for
[1:42:34] god
[1:42:35] if you haven't got them if jesus tarries
[1:42:38] my great grandchildren little paul's
[1:42:40] children that will still be the eternal
[1:42:43] truth of the living god
[1:42:45] now that was to find out
[1:42:47] what was sealed inside this mountain
[1:42:50] that wasn't wrote
[1:42:52] it had to be interpreted
[1:42:54] and when i come back and when i come
[1:42:56] back or rather when i came back
[1:43:00] because sometimes he would use pass
[1:43:01] because he was really
[1:43:03] thinking about the present or use
[1:43:05] present tense and he was really meant to
[1:43:07] say the future tense
[1:43:11] he he rather spoke in parables of time
[1:43:13] didn't he
[1:43:16] he said
[1:43:18] he said was it he says and when i come
[1:43:20] back
[1:43:21] when i came back
[1:43:23] in others to jeffersonville indiana
[1:43:25] the first angel
[1:43:27] on the first night
[1:43:29] opened the seal contrary to anything we
[1:43:32] ever heard
[1:43:34] in our life
[1:43:36] and
[1:43:37] all seven came out the same way
[1:43:40] he said you know that
[1:43:44] you were here present when it happened
[1:43:47] many of you
[1:43:52] the time of those seven sealed voices
[1:43:55] is when he begins to sound
[1:44:00] 1962
[1:44:02] is this the sign of the answer
[1:44:04] he says now
[1:44:06] when he begins to sound he's speaking of
[1:44:08] himself
[1:44:10] now when he begins to sound
[1:44:13] the seventh angel the elijah ministry
[1:44:16] the mystery will be finished now note
[1:44:19] then it's the time for the seven seal
[1:44:21] voices of revelations 10 to be revealed
[1:44:23] there you are
[1:44:24] do you understand
[1:44:26] congregation says
[1:44:30] that's what they said
[1:44:34] when all the mysteries of the book
[1:44:37] has completed
[1:44:39] and the bible said here that he would
[1:44:41] finish
[1:44:43] the mysteries that's it
[1:44:45] so revelations 10
[1:44:47] it's the seventh seal
[1:44:51] revelations 10
[1:44:53] it's the bride age
[1:44:54] amen
[1:44:55] revelations 10
[1:44:57] it's his coming
[1:45:00] amen because you know brother dave we'd
[1:45:02] sit in the audiences and they'd see us
[1:45:03] and they'd say they'd spot you right
[1:45:05] here and say and they'd look in your eye
[1:45:07] and say well if you think i don't know
[1:45:08] the difference between this coming is
[1:45:10] appearing
[1:45:11] they'd be talking right to you right
[1:45:16] revelations 10 it's the seventh seal
[1:45:19] revelations 10 it's the bride age
[1:45:21] revelations 10 it is coming
[1:45:24] and when the seven revelations 10 it's
[1:45:26] when the seven seals was opened there on
[1:45:28] the mountain february the 28th 1963
[1:45:33] revelations 10 it's when the seventh
[1:45:35] angel
[1:45:36] began to sound
[1:45:39] on march the 18th amen
[1:45:43] read with me revelations 10 verse 5 and
[1:45:45] 6.
[1:45:48] and it reads like this
[1:45:52] and the angel
[1:45:54] which i saw
[1:45:55] stand upon the scene upon the earth
[1:45:58] lifted up his hand to heaven
[1:46:01] and swear by him that liveth forever and
[1:46:04] ever who created heaven and the things
[1:46:06] therein are can the earth and the things
[1:46:09] therein are
[1:46:10] can the sea can the things which are
[1:46:12] therein
[1:46:13] that there should be time
[1:46:16] no longer
[1:46:20] and they asked
[1:46:21] the prophet a question and questions and
[1:46:23] answers 1964.
[1:46:26] time ended
[1:46:27] with the preaching of the seals
[1:46:31] and he said no
[1:46:32] he said now
[1:46:34] if time ceases when the seals were open
[1:46:37] if time ceased pardon me he's reading
[1:46:39] the question when the seals were open
[1:46:41] then the millennium is also finished is
[1:46:44] it not
[1:46:45] time didn't cease
[1:46:46] when the seals were open you
[1:46:48] misunderstood it
[1:46:50] amen you misunderstood it what happened
[1:46:53] the mysteries
[1:46:55] was revealed
[1:46:57] not time cease
[1:46:59] see just look watch real close now can
[1:47:03] watch real close now and play your tape
[1:47:05] if you got it from a tape see
[1:47:09] time never ceased
[1:47:11] this must be a post millennius or
[1:47:13] something that asks the question he says
[1:47:15] because you see we got a thousand years
[1:47:17] after the church has gone home and comes
[1:47:19] back upon the earth
[1:47:20] then time ceases in the new heavens and
[1:47:22] the new earth
[1:47:24] now the millennium is a type of noah
[1:47:27] going in the ark and carried over
[1:47:29] and brought ham and them on the other
[1:47:31] side and sin even come out amen
[1:47:34] of the ark he says
[1:47:36] see
[1:47:39] revelations
[1:47:41] 10 and 7.
[1:47:43] let's read it
[1:47:46] but in the days of the voice
[1:47:48] of the seventh angel
[1:47:51] when he shall begin to sound
[1:47:53] the mystery of god should be finished
[1:47:56] as he's declared to his servants
[1:47:59] the prophets
[1:48:03] revelations 10
[1:48:05] when the seventh angel begins to sound
[1:48:07] his message
[1:48:08] that was not the healing services
[1:48:12] a first and second poll
[1:48:14] it's the message that was to follow
[1:48:16] amen
[1:48:22] i know you're waiting for me to read the
[1:48:23] quote
[1:48:25] here it is
[1:48:27] i have heard but now i see 1965
[1:48:31] november the 27th
[1:48:33] in in less than in less than another 30
[1:48:35] days god will take him home amen this is
[1:48:38] what he said
[1:48:40] now we're promised the church age
[1:48:41] through reformers and we've had them
[1:48:44] but he promised in malachi 4 he'd keep
[1:48:46] his pattern
[1:48:48] always watch the pattern of the word
[1:48:50] read your bible and say lord show me the
[1:48:52] pattern of hebrews 13 8 that you're the
[1:48:55] same yesterday today and forever that
[1:48:58] you're unchanging from genesis to
[1:49:00] revelations
[1:49:03] now we're promised the church age to
[1:49:04] reformers and we've had them
[1:49:07] but he promised in malachi 4 he'd keep
[1:49:09] his pattern
[1:49:10] in the last days what would take place
[1:49:13] to turn the hearts of the children back
[1:49:15] to the faith of the apostolic fathers
[1:49:18] a character building process
[1:49:21] called sons and daughters being adopted
[1:49:24] into the very image of the stature of a
[1:49:26] perfect man there you are for that very
[1:49:29] purpose can the church is so broke broke
[1:49:32] up in denominations
[1:49:34] or you could read it and the message is
[1:49:37] so broke up and denominations and isms
[1:49:40] it's so torp to pieces till it's dead
[1:49:42] it's been a carrier
[1:49:44] and then he promised in the hour of the
[1:49:46] seventh angel's message
[1:49:48] the seven seals would be revealed
[1:49:50] the mysteries of god would be declared
[1:49:52] revelations 10.
[1:49:54] when the seventh angel begins to sound
[1:49:56] his message
[1:49:57] not the healing service
[1:50:00] not the healing service
[1:50:02] the message that follows
[1:50:05] the healing service
[1:50:08] we want to go back
[1:50:11] to the beginning
[1:50:14] i don't want to go back to the first
[1:50:16] poll
[1:50:21] no that's right
[1:50:23] were any of you
[1:50:24] in the tent meetings of the 60s and all
[1:50:27] we saw miracles there
[1:50:31] but i saw other things too that's right
[1:50:33] i don't want to go back
[1:50:35] to that
[1:50:40] the seventh angel
[1:50:44] then when he began to sound forth his
[1:50:46] ministry
[1:50:47] not when he started out healing the sick
[1:50:51] the rapture
[1:50:53] 1965
[1:50:55] december the 4th
[1:50:57] in 20 days god takes him home
[1:51:01] he says this
[1:51:02] now here's a messenger above
[1:51:05] always
[1:51:06] and a messenger on earth the english
[1:51:08] word angel means a messenger
[1:51:11] and in the seventh angels message while
[1:51:13] he was making his proclaiming his
[1:51:15] ministry then he began to sound forth
[1:51:17] his ministry
[1:51:19] not when he started out amen that's
[1:51:22] right
[1:51:23] jesus
[1:51:24] when he started out
[1:51:27] was he the lamb of god
[1:51:29] he was
[1:51:30] but he wasn't in the ministry that's
[1:51:32] exactly right
[1:51:34] he began in the ministry of the line of
[1:51:37] the tribe of judah amen
[1:51:40] and when he walked in
[1:51:42] to the garden of gethsemane
[1:51:44] he walked in saying lord
[1:51:47] not my will but thine be done
[1:51:51] and when he walked out
[1:51:54] after an hour in the presence of god yes
[1:51:57] the father
[1:51:59] he walked out with a ministerial change
[1:52:04] he took off his crown
[1:52:06] that no man saw
[1:52:08] he dropped his royal robe that no man
[1:52:11] knew he wore amen
[1:52:14] he laid down the scepter of a king
[1:52:17] yes sir
[1:52:21] he walked out
[1:52:22] without royal protection
[1:52:25] so he could give his life amen for you
[1:52:27] and i
[1:52:28] as the lamb of god
[1:52:32] he gave up all the supernatural
[1:52:34] protection
[1:52:36] so he could die for you and me
[1:52:41] hallelujah
[1:52:43] because he felt
[1:52:45] and he still does this morning
[1:52:49] that you
[1:52:51] are worth dying for
[1:52:53] amen
[1:52:55] the song says
[1:52:57] he thought
[1:52:59] i was worth dying for amen
[1:53:03] he thought i was to die for and he did
[1:53:11] the seven seals
[1:53:13] were preached on march the 17th 1963
[1:53:17] beginning with god and simplicity
[1:53:20] it was ten services
[1:53:22] in eight days
[1:53:23] and in march the 24th 1963
[1:53:27] the seventh seal was ministered
[1:53:29] so from february the 28th
[1:53:32] 1963
[1:53:34] to march the 24th 1963
[1:53:37] is 25 days total
[1:53:40] revelations
[1:53:42] 10 1
[1:53:44] to revelations 10 7
[1:53:47] fulfilled
[1:53:48] in 25 days
[1:53:50] amen
[1:53:53] sat for thousands of years
[1:53:55] but when the time came
[1:53:57] god said
[1:53:58] i'm going to make this a quick short
[1:54:00] work
[1:54:07] what has begun in the ministry of the
[1:54:09] sounding of the seventh angel
[1:54:11] the third paul ministry
[1:54:13] continued to 1965.
[1:54:18] the revealing of the word until god
[1:54:19] takes his prophet
[1:54:21] in an automobile accident october or
[1:54:23] december the 24th
[1:54:25] of 1965
[1:54:27] and the message of the seventh angel
[1:54:30] is completed amen
[1:54:32] someone might say
[1:54:34] well that's your opinion brother daniel
[1:54:38] yeah
[1:54:40] oh
[1:54:41] wait a minute i've got a quote
[1:54:47] it's in is this the sign of the answer
[1:54:50] paragraph 297
[1:54:52] and brother adam says this
[1:54:54] the book that's written within
[1:54:57] is then completed
[1:54:59] when this angel
[1:55:01] ceases amen
[1:55:06] he said now please understand this
[1:55:10] when the seventh angel message is
[1:55:12] completed
[1:55:13] the godhead ministry the serpent seed
[1:55:16] all the other mysteries of all these
[1:55:18] things
[1:55:21] he said but the book that's written
[1:55:22] within
[1:55:24] is then completed
[1:55:25] when this angel
[1:55:28] ceases
[1:55:30] god takes him home
[1:55:32] the very fact that god took him home is
[1:55:34] a sign that's it
[1:55:36] all the loose ends have been tied
[1:55:37] together that's it
[1:55:38] that's right
[1:55:43] you say brother daniel
[1:55:44] he preached it i've heard the seals and
[1:55:47] i don't see it
[1:55:48] well that's called a need in your life
[1:55:51] called revelation
[1:55:54] how do you get it
[1:55:56] go back to the book
[1:56:00] amen
[1:56:01] it shall be opened unto you amen seek
[1:56:04] and you shall find that's right ask and
[1:56:07] it shall be given to you
[1:56:09] but if you keep saying no it's not open
[1:56:12] you're not asking
[1:56:13] that's not asking
[1:56:16] that's telling
[1:56:20] that's not asking that's telling
[1:56:29] in the message influence
[1:56:32] 1963
[1:56:34] brother branham says
[1:56:36] he's ministering
[1:56:38] he says i must decrease
[1:56:40] okay he must increase
[1:56:43] but he said it this way in talking of
[1:56:46] john the baptist
[1:56:47] he said what did john the baptist do
[1:56:50] the man that jesus said there was never
[1:56:52] a man born of a woman like him
[1:56:55] or could compare with him
[1:56:59] until that time
[1:57:00] that great prophet ordained of god
[1:57:03] before the foundation of the world spoke
[1:57:05] of 12 or 700 years before he ever come
[1:57:08] on
[1:57:09] he said or for 700 or 1200 years rather
[1:57:12] before he came to the earth by the
[1:57:14] prophet isaiah here what did he do when
[1:57:17] he seen a man come walking down out of
[1:57:20] the audience and he looked up above and
[1:57:22] saw that fire coming down from heaven in
[1:57:24] the form of dobby cried out i have need
[1:57:27] to be baptized of thee
[1:57:31] he said then brother man says i must
[1:57:33] decrease
[1:57:35] he must increase
[1:57:40] now he's talking in the first person
[1:57:44] now it takes revelation
[1:57:46] then he says
[1:57:47] god can't have two on the earth at the
[1:57:50] same time
[1:57:51] only one has the message you know
[1:57:54] i must decrease
[1:57:56] it's 1963 it's november the 30th
[1:58:00] influence he says
[1:58:02] he says
[1:58:04] god can't have two on the earth at the
[1:58:06] same time
[1:58:08] only one has the message in him
[1:58:11] i must decrease
[1:58:12] and then he says
[1:58:14] he is the messenger
[1:58:16] christ
[1:58:17] the holy spirit
[1:58:19] he is the messenger then he says
[1:58:21] i've been
[1:58:23] up to this time
[1:58:24] of november 63
[1:58:28] the 30th
[1:58:29] i've been up to this time
[1:58:32] now
[1:58:33] he takes my place
[1:58:37] what was the forerunner doing
[1:58:41] he was decreasing that's right
[1:58:48] because he wanted to be sure
[1:58:50] that when god took him off the scene
[1:58:53] he had decreased in your eyes amen and
[1:58:56] christ had increased
[1:58:58] that's what makes him a prophet to me
[1:59:01] that's what makes him the seventh angel
[1:59:03] to me
[1:59:04] that's what makes him the forerunner
[1:59:05] like elijah
[1:59:07] like the first one to me
[1:59:10] amen because he followed he was
[1:59:12] following the pattern of god's word
[1:59:14] when john said two i must decrease
[1:59:18] he must increase
[1:59:20] who's he john that's my cousin how
[1:59:22] convenient john you and your cousin huh
[1:59:26] nice little setup you guys have you're
[1:59:28] the forerunner he's but he was the
[1:59:30] forerunner and christ was the lamb of
[1:59:32] god
[1:59:34] and brother branham says
[1:59:36] 1963
[1:59:38] november the 30th
[1:59:40] i must decrease
[1:59:42] he's the messenger i've been up to this
[1:59:45] time
[1:59:46] now he takes my place
[1:59:48] as elisha when elijah went up and
[1:59:50] throwed back his robe to elisha his
[1:59:53] ministry was finished
[1:59:54] elisha must take up where he left off he
[1:59:57] must increase
[1:59:59] i
[2:00:00] must decrease
[2:00:04] this man
[2:00:06] really had a revelation
[2:00:08] of his ministry amen
[2:00:12] and he wasn't building his own kingdom
[2:00:16] the seventh angel
[2:00:17] was building the kingdom of god
[2:00:20] and of his christ
[2:00:25] after the forerunner has left the scene
[2:00:29] who is the messenger
[2:00:30] follow the pattern
[2:00:32] the holy spirit
[2:00:34] christ in his bride amen amen as he was
[2:00:37] in his prophet exactly right
[2:00:40] and what follows is a ministerial change
[2:00:43] from a one-man ministry
[2:00:45] to the ministry of a many member body
[2:00:48] like it was in the book of acts like it
[2:00:51] happened on the day of pentecost
[2:00:54] like jesus told them go terry in
[2:00:56] jerusalem
[2:00:58] i'm going to ascend
[2:01:02] you folks will stay here
[2:01:04] and now i'm going to work through my
[2:01:06] church it went from a one-man ministry
[2:01:10] to a many-membered body
[2:01:12] to a five-full ministry
[2:01:15] amen yeah amen that's right that's right
[2:01:23] don't just
[2:01:24] push them to
[2:01:26] to push play
[2:01:28] push them to the altar to get baptized
[2:01:30] and surrender their lives to jesus
[2:01:32] christ
[2:01:34] and we ain't playing around when we say
[2:01:36] that
[2:01:37] that's right
[2:01:40] revelations 10 verse
[2:01:42] 8-11
[2:01:45] and the voice
[2:01:46] which i heard from heaven
[2:01:48] spake unto me again
[2:01:52] this is john
[2:01:53] and said
[2:01:54] go and take the little book
[2:01:57] which is open in the hand of the angel
[2:01:59] which standeth upon the sea
[2:02:01] and upon the earth
[2:02:03] if you'll notice
[2:02:06] john wasn't told to take the book out of
[2:02:09] the seventh angel's hand no that's right
[2:02:12] no
[2:02:13] he said go back
[2:02:15] to the original owner
[2:02:17] go back to the mighty angel amen
[2:02:19] remember revelations 5 and 5
[2:02:25] the lion of the tribe of judah prefailed
[2:02:28] to take the book
[2:02:30] he took it from the original owner
[2:02:32] then you get down to verses 7 8-9
[2:02:35] and now it says and the lamb took the
[2:02:37] book
[2:02:38] from him that sat on the throne he went
[2:02:41] back to the original owner
[2:02:43] what does that mean
[2:02:44] to go back to the original owner all the
[2:02:46] time
[2:02:49] it speaks of a ministerial change
[2:02:52] and revelations 10 8
[2:02:54] john going back to take the book from
[2:02:57] the original owner it's a ministerial
[2:02:59] change from a one-man ministry from the
[2:03:02] seventh angel to a many-membered body of
[2:03:05] the bride of jesus christ
[2:03:09] the same god same christ but a
[2:03:11] ministerial change
[2:03:14] has taken place
[2:03:17] verse 9
[2:03:19] and i went up unto the angel and said
[2:03:21] unto him to give me the little book he
[2:03:23] said unto me take it eat it up
[2:03:26] it shall make thy belly bitter
[2:03:28] but it shall be in thy mouth sweet as
[2:03:30] honey
[2:03:32] and i took the little book out of the
[2:03:34] angel's hand and ate it up
[2:03:36] and it was in my mouth
[2:03:38] sweet as honey
[2:03:40] and as soon as i had eaten it
[2:03:42] my belly
[2:03:44] was bitter
[2:03:45] and he said unto me
[2:03:47] thou must prophesy again
[2:03:49] before many peoples
[2:03:51] and nations
[2:03:52] and tongues
[2:03:54] and kings
[2:03:57] seven seals
[2:03:59] it's seven parts
[2:04:01] of one plan of redemption
[2:04:03] for the bride tree
[2:04:05] and the fig tree
[2:04:07] you see how god hid it
[2:04:08] he took the smallest part
[2:04:11] the seal
[2:04:13] highlighted it
[2:04:15] and everybody's running what's a seal
[2:04:17] what does it mean a seal a seal seal
[2:04:21] and it's just a little dot of wax on the
[2:04:23] scroll
[2:04:25] called the book in english
[2:04:32] and everyone's looking the seal to seal
[2:04:34] the seal
[2:04:35] and the bride says
[2:04:37] no no no
[2:04:38] remove the seal
[2:04:40] open the book
[2:04:42] read the promises of god
[2:04:48] written from genesis to revelations
[2:04:52] yes sir that's right our book
[2:04:55] is the bible amen
[2:04:57] all the promises of god
[2:04:59] are in the bible
[2:05:03] and he sent the prophet
[2:05:05] and he put on tape
[2:05:08] okay and pointed us back to the bun
[2:05:14] brother gave me a testimony
[2:05:17] another brother invites him go out
[2:05:19] have lunch
[2:05:21] well that'd be great
[2:05:23] and as he gets off his car he's
[2:05:25] waiting by the front door of this
[2:05:27] restaurant

[2:13:38] to the lion of the tribe of judah
[2:13:40] to the lamb of god
[2:13:42] [Music]
[2:13:43] after he he opened the book and gave it
[2:13:45] to the firstborn son israel
[2:13:48] israel rejected it and at the cross of
[2:13:50] calvary the crossing of the hands
[2:13:53] the lion's share that went to the
[2:13:55] firstborn was given to you and i

[2:14:01] the lion gave it to israel
[2:14:04] at the first coming of christ and they
[2:14:05] rejected
