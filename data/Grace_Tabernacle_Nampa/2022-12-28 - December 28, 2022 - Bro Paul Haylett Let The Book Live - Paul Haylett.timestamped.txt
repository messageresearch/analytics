[12:31] figured I'd share it with you here
[12:35] um it's about it was just an article I
[12:38] read and talked about the American
[12:40] buffalo
[12:41] I was talking about the American
[12:43] buffaloes kind of telling the different
[12:45] traits of the American buffalo and you
[12:47] know buffaloes stand like a male Buffalo
[12:49] stands like seven feet tall
[12:51] and you know they've got thick fur to
[12:54] make help them make it through the
[12:55] winters in North America and the planes
[12:58] there and um
[13:00] there but can get up to like three
[13:02] thousand pounds
[13:03] big big old huge things you know and
[13:05] they can they can run a pretty good clip
[13:08] but the most interesting thing I found
[13:10] about the buffalo
[13:12] was
[13:14] when the Buffalo looks up and it sees a
[13:16] mountain and the storm starts to roll
[13:19] over the mountain
[13:21] the Buffalo doesn't doesn't run away
[13:23] from the storm
[13:24] the Buffalo doesn't sit there the
[13:26] Buffalo turns and it runs directly into
[13:28] the storm
[13:30] and what I thought was interesting about
[13:32] this couple things but
[13:35] the Buffaloes takes off running as fast
[13:37] as it can into that storm to get through
[13:39] that storm wants to make it to the other
[13:41] side
[13:42] right
[13:44] the Buffalo doesn't sit there and look
[13:45] at its friends and say
[13:47] what should we do here
[13:49] or
[13:50] look at what the work what the people
[13:51] are doing around here what his family's
[13:53] doing
[13:54] the Buffaloes turns and runs it doesn't
[13:56] make a choice it does it has an instinct
[13:59] within it says this is what you do when
[14:02] a storm comes
[14:04] I thought that was pretty amazing
[14:06] I thought about us as Christians
[14:08] sometimes
[14:10] in the article it went on to talk about
[14:12] cattle and people and said people
[14:13] shelter in storms and cattle run from
[14:16] storms I thought but as Christians why
[14:19] not run into the storm why not embrace
[14:21] the storm
[14:23] right because in adversity we grow Our
[14:26] Roots go deeper we get closer to God
[14:29] right
[14:32] then I thought about it a little bit
[14:33] further
[14:35] I thought about
[14:37] imagine a herd a massive herd of buffalo
[14:39] that Rumble running across a plane just
[14:42] running into storm with everything they
[14:43] have praise God
[14:46] it got me a little excited
[14:51] amen right
[14:55] let's let's Embrace these things
[14:57] sometimes that that
[14:58] God brings our way because you know I
[15:00] bring storms our way right
[15:03] to clear the way on the other side amen
[15:06] just thought I'd share that with you I
[15:08] want to sing a master of the Wind

[15:21] [Music]
[15:32] ever there's a wind in myself
[15:40] but my heavenly father
[15:44] he watches over me when the breeze turns
[15:51] into again

[16:05] I know the make of
[16:08] the rain

[16:18] shine again
[16:21] I know the master of the wind let's just

[29:00] [Music]
[29:07] oh my rest was
[29:12] stronging
[29:14] to be free
[29:20] oh let your Holy Spirit fall
[29:31] you know this might seem like a paradox
[29:34] Saints but
[29:35] to get through this storm
[29:38] that Spirit of calmness goes to be on us
[29:43] you see you look around in the world
[29:46] today and you will see that the whole
[29:50] whole atmosphere
[29:54] of the world today is being put in a
[29:57] position of fear
[29:59] just had someone we got home from this
[30:01] trip and I had an individual say now now
[30:05] it's not safe
[30:07] it's not safe in self but why did you go
[30:10] there
[30:13] but you realize that
[30:15] as some Daughters of God
[30:18] we don't walk foolishly
[30:21] but we walk
[30:22] in the calm in the center of this storm
[30:25] that's overtaking this world and
[30:28] you know
[30:30] it's there that
[30:31] when the Holy Spirit comes down and
[30:33] moves you we do not look at the
[30:36] circumstance we do not look at distance
[30:39] we do not look at the height of the
[30:40] mountain we do not look at this storm
[30:44] because we're under this anointing
[30:47] to just trust and I got a thousand
[30:49] things to share we'll probably hear
[30:51] about Israel for months now but just to
[30:54] realize to make something so real to you
[30:57] we took a lovely boat ride out across
[31:00] the Sea of Galilee and it's really not
[31:03] that big 13 miles but I don't remember
[31:05] exactly how I forgotten the other
[31:08] measurement it's not really that big but
[31:10] it's big enough
[31:13] it's big enough
[31:15] and as the song says he's looking down
[31:18] on us scripture tells us how Jesus
[31:22] went to the mountain not just to watch
[31:25] the disciples he had business to take
[31:28] care of
[31:29] but he's just sitting up there the
[31:31] prophet of God said he's just looking
[31:32] and watching them
[31:35] you see they needed to go through that
[31:37] storm
[31:38] they needed to experience that but he
[31:41] had his eye on them and he knew right
[31:44] exactly there would be no finer if I
[31:47] could put it this way today not even the
[31:49] most finest of quality of a GPS could
[31:53] have pinpointed the spot that he knew he
[31:56] was going to meet them any better than
[31:58] it was and I'm telling you he knows
[32:01] exactly where to meet us to come right
[32:05] at that moment we just need
[32:08] to learn to trust him
[32:10] there is the greatest thing to learn to
[32:13] trust him thank you sister Ruth thank
[32:15] you brother Isaac I want to just this
[32:18] comes a little bit out of our our uh
[32:21] travels there and uh I just want to uh
[32:26] speak to you this evening
[32:29] on a Living Word
[32:32] living
[32:33] tradition and so we look at this and I
[32:36] would title it tonight let the book live
[32:39] and so let's just turn in our Bibles
[32:42] um to uh
[32:45] first Peter the first chapter 18th verse
[32:48] and we'll just take our thought there
[32:49] tonight from that it is good to be home
[32:53] um we had a lovely time there I
[32:55] appreciate your prayers we had a uh you
[32:59] know between brother George and um the
[33:02] guide uh we felt like we were almost on
[33:05] a marathon and uh so you know somebody
[33:09] said how was your vacation and I said we
[33:11] went on a vacation
[33:12] uh because from there we got on a plane
[33:16] we flew back to Johannesburg got in
[33:19] there late by the time everything's done
[33:20] got a motel room went to the airport
[33:23] bright and early in the morning got on a
[33:25] plane flew to Cape Town got there was
[33:29] treated like royalty but they sure
[33:31] worked their royalty hard and so we had
[33:34] a lovely time uh 172 young people that
[33:38] we had the privilege of of ministering
[33:41] to and uh just to see God working no
[33:45] altar calls but to see God move man it's
[33:48] the Holy Spirit not man and moving upon
[33:51] these young people to see a lovely
[33:53] response lovely testimonies and we thank
[33:56] the Lord for that got on a plane went
[33:59] back to Johannesburg had a few days I
[34:02] would say of leisure if you call being
[34:05] forced to get out of bed at 4am leisure
[34:08] brother Gideon's a Taskmaster
[34:10] but we had a lovely time and God blessed
[34:13] us and there we had about somewhere in
[34:16] the region of 125 30 young people in in
[34:19] those meetings and uh the Lord moved
[34:22] miraculously we won't go into it tonight
[34:25] but we saw the Lord come down and deal
[34:29] with young people
[34:30] to come and confess things that would
[34:33] not be of the natural
[34:35] for one to come and say this is what's
[34:38] happening in my life but the Holy Spirit
[34:40] dealing and we say thank you Lord
[34:43] tonight for that and then we got to go
[34:46] for the final night uh brother uh ask us
[34:49] to come and finish up uh their youth
[34:53] services and uh so we got to be a part
[34:56] of brother Reuben Daniels Church's final
[35:00] closing out of their youth camp services
[35:03] and so just a real blessing then hold to
[35:07] the airport bright and early and thrown
[35:09] on an airplane and a little wave goodbye
[35:12] and here we are so first Peter the first
[35:15] chapter verse 18. for as much as you
[35:18] know that ye were not redeemed with
[35:22] corruptable things isn't that wonderful
[35:25] there's no counterfeit there's no
[35:27] inferior
[35:29] there's nothing that would fade away
[35:32] not redeemed with corruptable things as
[35:34] silver and gold
[35:36] wait
[35:37] did you see where he placed the things
[35:39] that we worked so hard for
[35:41] as corruptable
[35:44] and it was not what we were redeemed
[35:46] with
[35:47] my thank you Lord
[35:49] from your vain conversation received by
[35:53] tradition from your fathers
[35:55] but with the precious blood of Christ as
[35:58] of a lamb without blemish and without
[36:00] spot who verily was foreign before the
[36:04] foundation of the world but was manifest
[36:06] in these last times for you
[36:10] now my brother and sister he did not
[36:12] just say that in those words for us as a
[36:16] demonstration but it was the literal
[36:19] manifestation of the word in our hour
[36:23] Amen in our day which is what is what's
[36:26] bringing this in these last times and
[36:30] manifested it for us so that we can take
[36:32] it as a tangible object today amen
[36:35] people would say well religion's not
[36:37] tangible I'm here to tell you it is
[36:39] tangible it is a life-changing power
[36:42] that will be and you can see the
[36:45] evidence manifested in human flesh amen
[36:49] who by him do believe in God that raised
[36:52] him up from the dead and gave him glory
[36:54] that your Faith and Hope might be in God
[36:57] seeing ye have purified your souls in
[37:00] obeying the truth through the spirit and
[37:03] to unfeigned love of the Brethren see
[37:06] that ye love one another with a pure
[37:08] heart fervently Amen to me when I read
[37:12] this it is the same communication as it
[37:16] is to be hot or cold or lukewarm so this
[37:20] love is not something that we just say
[37:22] well I'll do my best to love the
[37:24] Brethren but it is something that we
[37:27] fervently we fervently pursue and you
[37:30] know what fervently pursuing that
[37:32] sometimes means we need to apologize and
[37:34] we need to repent
[37:36] sometimes it causes us to move beyond
[37:39] our justification of our situation and
[37:42] to a place that we are set free amen we
[37:45] sing the song my chains are gone
[37:48] amen what if that chain is just merely
[37:50] an attitude that we have towards someone
[37:52] and it's hindering the moving of the
[37:55] spirit amen
[37:58] amen being born again not of corruptable
[38:01] seed but
[38:02] of Incorruptible by the word of God
[38:05] which liveth and abideth forever for All
[38:07] Flesh is as grass and all the glory of
[38:10] man as the flower of grass the grass
[38:13] withereth and the flower thereof falleth
[38:16] away but the word of the Lord endureth
[38:19] forever can we say Amen the word of the
[38:23] Lord endureth forever and this is the
[38:25] word which by the gospel is preached
[38:28] unto you amen Heavenly Father we thank
[38:31] you for this time to be home to be
[38:33] amongst the Saints Lord we just ask you
[38:36] father just come move in our lives Lord
[38:39] father if there be something in our life
[38:41] Lord that needs to be dealt with needs
[38:44] to be purged needs to be washed away
[38:45] then father I know I lift my hand
[38:48] tonight and say Lord Purge me father if
[38:51] there be something there Purge me Lord I
[38:54] want to be clean father wash us wider
[38:57] than snow is our heart's desire tonight
[38:59] we ask this in the precious name of
[39:02] Jesus Christ amen you may be seated
[39:07] now tonight I want to speak to you for
[39:09] just a few minutes of a living word or
[39:12] living tradition and as we look at this
[39:15] my brother and sister it might seem as
[39:18] though that when we talk of tradition
[39:20] that uh it would be something that would
[39:24] be kind of
[39:25] not good you might say something that
[39:28] that uh we should stay away from but as
[39:31] we'll look at this and the Lord really
[39:33] drove this home to me as we are there in
[39:35] Israel and in our time in Israel we saw
[39:39] uh uh the uh conservative or
[39:42] ultra-conservative Jewish man that is
[39:45] there and we saw the other end of the
[39:47] spectrum the very Ultra liberal Jew and
[39:51] so it's in there we see just as it is in
[39:53] America we see both ends of this
[39:56] spectrum and you know as brother George
[39:59] often preaches to us we need balance so
[40:02] somewhere between this
[40:03] ultra-conservative and this liberal has
[40:06] got to be the real Jew and I will tell
[40:08] you just from observation that I seen
[40:11] Jewish families now they were wearing
[40:14] the men were wearing their little cap
[40:16] and I forget the name of that I'm so bad
[40:18] with those things but it's there you see
[40:20] them but we see wives that look like
[40:23] they could be a message sister very
[40:26] conservative in their dress a very Godly
[40:29] looking long beautiful hair and it
[40:32] causes you to stop and think could this
[40:35] possibly now we're not trying to imply
[40:37] but we could this possibly be one of the
[40:40] 144 000 that God is already preparing
[40:44] them in such a fashion that all they
[40:47] need now is to receive the word and they
[40:50] already fit in the picture of the word
[40:52] and I don't know that but it's just
[40:54] something that stirs your heart and so
[40:57] one of the things and I hope you don't
[40:58] mind me being kind of direct with this
[41:01] tonight but you see that we see these
[41:04] these ultra-conservative Jewish men they
[41:07] they have their cap they have The
[41:10] Sideburns kind of curl that hang down
[41:12] and we see their coat and their dress
[41:15] and everything about them we see them
[41:18] standing at the corner of the table as
[41:20] they're there in the restaurant or
[41:22] whatever and they're reading their
[41:24] prayer they're not ashamed to stand
[41:26] there and read their prayers and to do
[41:28] this and it's there you look at that and
[41:30] say now there's a man who doesn't care
[41:32] he's standing boldly in the public and
[41:35] he's reading these prayers and reciting
[41:37] these things but the thing that is
[41:39] shocking is on the other side of the
[41:41] table is a woman dressed so horribly
[41:45] it's his wife
[41:48] what a paradox
[41:50] to see this a man who is standing here
[41:53] and he's doing this my brother and
[41:55] sister is I'm going to try and keep
[41:57] tonight kind of brief he's doing this
[41:59] because this is the tradition he has
[42:02] been taught and he's raising his
[42:04] children up his young sons in the same
[42:07] exact fashion but you see my brother and
[42:09] sister that is not a living tradition
[42:12] that is not a tradition that is full of
[42:15] life they are following as the word
[42:17] would be they're following by wrote
[42:20] they are just doing as they're taught
[42:22] and you see this and you look at this
[42:24] and you Marvel because when I'd say not
[42:27] dressed very good I mean just let your
[42:29] imagination not roam very far please but
[42:32] your imagination would be no not not a
[42:35] drop different then you could just go
[42:37] here in these places in America and see
[42:40] someone dressed high heels tight skirt
[42:43] lipstick huge earrings
[42:46] and something strikes you and you
[42:48] realize you know what we oftentimes look
[42:51] at tradition as well we don't want
[42:53] Traditions I preacher right here from
[42:55] this Pulpit the Traditions the
[42:57] traditions and traditions are coming in
[42:59] the message but my brother and sister
[43:00] there's some tradition that is good
[43:03] there's some tradition for us to hold on
[43:05] to and as the word of God has showed us
[43:07] how we should be we should hold to the
[43:10] tradition of reading our Bible we should
[43:13] hold to the tradition of praying we
[43:15] should hold to the tradition of being
[43:18] faithful in the house of God and if you
[43:20] want to study that further go dig into
[43:22] the definitions take the background
[43:24] these are things that have been laid
[43:27] down to us that we should hold to and
[43:30] follow daily so as we look at this and
[43:33] realize that there is a tradition that
[43:36] is uh living and there's tradition that
[43:39] is dead but we see my brother and sister
[43:42] that we have to find that balance by the
[43:44] word of God we have to find that balance
[43:46] we revealed out of the word not because
[43:49] we're just going to preach it nuts can
[43:51] be just called uh uh you know following
[43:54] or legalism or however it would be but
[43:57] this needs to be a word
[44:00] amen this needs to be a word that is
[44:02] touching Us in every aspect of our life
[44:04] every day of our life not because my
[44:07] family I was born in this message not
[44:09] because we this and because we that but
[44:12] something that has struck down in the
[44:14] soul and we say this word is alive today
[44:17] we don't need to teach it as a tradition
[44:19] because it's living
[44:21] hey man we don't have to go back and say
[44:24] now pardon me for saying it this way but
[44:26] we don't have to go back and say the
[44:28] prophet said the prophet said the
[44:30] prophet said this book is alive
[44:33] this book is speaking to us this book is
[44:37] preaching to us and the Very life that
[44:39] is in Christ is becoming as it were a
[44:43] tradition but it is a living tradition
[44:45] it is a living word that is having an
[44:48] impact Upon Our Life
[44:50] now my brother and sister our guide
[44:53] it's the first time brother George has
[44:55] worked with him because the guy that
[44:56] brother I believe his name was Reuben
[44:59] that brother George worked with for
[45:01] years uh elderly and he's passed away so
[45:04] now he's working with a new guide yair
[45:07] and and a nice man with an interesting
[45:09] life an interesting story but
[45:13] he's very bold to let you know that he
[45:17] is a secular Jew he is not religious
[45:20] but he knew the scripture
[45:22] very very well he he had a grasp of the
[45:26] scripture and could say well here in
[45:28] Isaiah or here in Jeremiah or here or
[45:31] here but you know what being a Jew he's
[45:33] not real fond of the New Testament so
[45:35] much so that there was a time we come to
[45:37] a certain place and it's interesting how
[45:40] these things are communicated there was
[45:42] a time that he's on the bus and he's
[45:44] there and there's a little deal there
[45:46] and he says now let me point out this is
[45:48] where the New Testament is wrong
[45:52] and there was this
[45:54] in the bus and he's like you didn't like
[45:59] that
[46:00] nope we didn't because the New Testament
[46:04] is not wrong
[46:06] and so he kind of threw another little
[46:08] deal out later about that and when he
[46:11] got a very cold shoulder I even felt a
[46:13] cold front just like the one that went
[46:15] through here the other day just kind of
[46:17] rolling along with some snowflakes and
[46:19] icicles in it I felt it Go by our seat
[46:22] in the Isle of the bus and he's up there
[46:24] and you can tell he's like uncomfortable
[46:27] but you see he's approaching it but I
[46:30] asked him you know you you know a lot of
[46:32] scripture and he says well whether
[46:34] you're secular family or not as a Jew
[46:36] you you are taught these things as a
[46:39] child it's just that in a secular family
[46:41] you you just can discard you just walk
[46:44] away from it after a point of time I I
[46:47] kind of wondered you know brother
[46:48] somebody else mentioned to brother
[46:50] George and it said how long before you
[46:52] have him converted brother George
[46:54] well I'm telling you my brother and
[46:56] sister God works in mysterious ways a
[46:59] nice man most the people I believe on
[47:01] the tour really enjoyed it but you know
[47:04] it's there that you know his explanation
[47:07] really centered around the fact that as
[47:10] a Jew
[47:11] he's just expected to learn some of
[47:13] these things and I think we could
[47:16] share that expectation tonight Saints
[47:19] message Believers this is not about
[47:22] dates this is not about us saying well
[47:25] this happened on this date and this
[47:27] happened on that day to be able to
[47:29] create some kind of a profile but my
[47:32] brother and sister I believe as our
[47:34] brother Steve Burson once said he said
[47:37] you know I'm not going to even read
[47:38] quotes to you uh he said because if you
[47:42] are a message believer you'll know what
[47:44] I'm talking about and I believe that we
[47:47] should have that kind of expectation as
[47:50] it were that we should dig in to the
[47:52] word of God and dig into the message
[47:55] that it is not something foreign to us
[47:58] but it is common it's on the in the tip
[48:00] of our tongue it's at our fingertips it
[48:03] is our very life
[48:08] and you see
[48:10] the very power of what it means to be a
[48:13] Jew
[48:14] we went to a military museum
[48:17] a very sweet young lady was there
[48:20] brother George picked it up in an
[48:22] instant and he says you talk with a a
[48:26] accent as it were with Spanish attached
[48:30] to it
[48:31] and the little girl was a little bit
[48:33] shocked brother George says where are
[48:35] you from and she said I'm from Argentina
[48:39] so he could pick up that and here's this
[48:42] young lady I talked to her quite a bit
[48:44] after the fact that it's there she's was
[48:47] eight years old when her family being
[48:50] Jewish made a decision and picked up and
[48:54] moved back to Israel
[48:57] but you can tell she's not religious
[49:00] she's a Jew
[49:06] I pray Saints
[49:08] I pray
[49:10] that we our families and those we know
[49:14] are not falling in the same kind of trap
[49:19] that we're here just because of a reason
[49:23] but let it be a real experience let it
[49:26] be a real life a real something that is
[49:28] down inside of us shaking us moving us
[49:31] and doing that but a lovely girl with a
[49:34] lovely spirit and I got to talk to her
[49:36] and she lived on the outskirts of Buenos
[49:38] Aires and I got to speak to her about
[49:40] life and that I had been there I've know
[49:43] that road and I know these places and
[49:45] seen this and just chatted with her for
[49:47] just a brief moment and and I said what
[49:50] do you think the future is and she says
[49:52] I don't know if they let me I might just
[49:54] stay in the military for a while it
[49:56] gives me structure it gives me something
[49:58] to do and just a really nice nice young
[50:02] lady but you see what attracted them my
[50:05] brother and sister that family was not
[50:08] that they're necessarily looking for the
[50:10] Messiah the same way as the older
[50:12] religious there but their their believe
[50:14] there's a promise there there's
[50:16] something even in their condition they
[50:18] believe there's a promise there and they
[50:21] believe that someday a messiah is going
[50:23] to come back back and your heart kind of
[50:25] bleeds it's not the time or the place to
[50:28] do this she's a guide in a military
[50:30] museum but it's there that you would
[50:32] like to somehow be able to explain to
[50:35] them that it's not just a fact a messiah
[50:38] is coming back but there has to be a
[50:41] life that goes with this what the word
[50:43] says and so it's there I kept finding
[50:46] myself in these comparisons correlating
[50:50] this together my brother and sister it's
[50:52] not just that Christ is coming but is he
[50:55] coming for us
[50:57] there's the difference it really breaks
[51:00] it down and unfortunately sometimes
[51:02] people get caught up in and Jesus is
[51:04] returning going to be a Rapture well
[51:07] there ought to be a fervent burning
[51:09] desire in us that at the Forefront of
[51:12] this Rapture you will find me
[51:14] at the Forefront of the coming of the
[51:17] Lord I will be there at the Forefront of
[51:20] the word being proclaimed in our day you
[51:22] will find me standing there proclaiming
[51:25] that Christ is my healer he's my savior
[51:28] he's my provider he is my king and he's
[51:32] also my bridegroom
[51:35] see there's the fervency that comes with
[51:37] this not just a messiah coming back
[51:40] you see it was the Messiah coming that
[51:42] caused them
[51:44] to miss it in the first place
[51:46] they had just put it as though it was
[51:49] going to be a public demonstration
[51:51] but I like how the prophet of God said
[51:54] you know that I'm going to paraphrase
[51:56] this that there's coming a time it will
[51:58] no longer be a public show
[52:02] what will be done will be done in secret
[52:06] and my brother and sister it's very
[52:07] interesting there's a young man that is
[52:09] a pastor in Hoffa has a nice little
[52:11] group but he's got a revelation
[52:14] that he is not there to try and convert
[52:16] the Jew because he knows it's God's time
[52:19] and it's there he is there he's
[52:21] preaching to Russians and ukrainians and
[52:24] and uh Filipinos and whatever that are
[52:27] laboring and working have jobs there and
[52:30] he almost shies away from
[52:33] trying to interact in a religious level
[52:36] with the Jews because he knows in God's
[52:40] time that this will be revealed and that
[52:43] takes me back before I move on when
[52:45] you're walking down the street and see a
[52:47] family that's obviously Jewish but
[52:50] they're not adorned even like those that
[52:53] are of the the oh I had a word for that
[52:56] and I've lost it there uh of that there
[52:58] there brother George uses the word and I
[53:01] thought those interests I'll get
[53:02] sidetracked for a moment we're in a
[53:04] place and and a man says to brother
[53:06] George he's looking at the sisters I
[53:08] watched him looking my wife on the
[53:10] sisters and he's looking you know kind
[53:12] of quizzically and finally he says so so
[53:14] what are you guys and brother George
[53:16] just steps up boldly and says we are of
[53:19] the Orthodox of Christians
[53:21] foreign
[53:23] and the individual just went
[53:26] okay
[53:29] because you see they have
[53:33] they have an image of what Christianity
[53:36] is
[53:38] and can we actually blame them for not
[53:41] liking that image
[53:44] people dressed in any old-fashioned
[53:46] using any old language acting in any old
[53:49] way and saying we're Christians no
[53:52] wonder they're not happy and don't want
[53:55] the association but brother George he's
[53:57] figured it out he prayed about it God
[53:59] showed him whatever however come but
[54:01] this is how he says I plan on expressing
[54:04] it from now on we are the Orthodox of
[54:08] Christianity we are the original we are
[54:11] the standard to be measured by can we
[54:13] say Amen to that tonight that's who I
[54:16] want to be not some kind of convoluted
[54:18] hybrid thing that gives them you know an
[54:21] imitation of Christianity but something
[54:24] that would they would be able to look it
[54:26] up and say you're different
[54:31] I overheard brother George in a little
[54:33] conversation
[54:36] trying to kind of put this out to
[54:38] somebody and somebody said something
[54:39] about Trinity and brother George says
[54:42] we're not trinitarians we're believers
[54:46] and so you look at this and oftentimes
[54:48] we get caught up as being message
[54:50] Believers that we forget what really the
[54:53] image is the image is not just
[54:57] necessarily dresses and hair in this but
[55:00] we are projecting we can I say that even
[55:03] more bold we are projecting Jesus Christ
[55:07] and it's not just about what I believe
[55:10] or I have a Doctrine or we no what are
[55:13] we projecting now I say God help us to
[55:17] be projectors of Jesus Christ
[55:20] amen so it's there
[55:23] it's we we share those expectations
[55:26] because we certainly desire for our
[55:28] children to learn we we don't want our
[55:30] children sitting in church and and
[55:31] coming out years later just void of any
[55:34] knowledge of the Bible void of the basic
[55:38] foundations of what it is to be a
[55:40] Christian in this day but we desire Amen
[55:43] to teach our children and some of that
[55:47] is tradition
[55:56] think about it we can get a real
[55:59] negative thought about tradition
[56:01] but there is a portion of tradition that
[56:05] is the word of God
[56:08] we could be described as traditional
[56:11] Christians
[56:13] because we have taken the words of our
[56:16] Lord Jesus Christ we have taken the
[56:18] teaching of the Apostles and we have
[56:21] followed it and we preach it and we
[56:24] believe it and we repeat it and we
[56:26] project it and so you could say oh you
[56:29] have a tradition and I would say yes and
[56:32] but there is another side even a deeper
[56:34] side I'll just want to bump against
[56:35] tonight I want to be the kind of
[56:38] Christian that has a tradition that I'm
[56:40] soft and I am tender and I can be moved
[56:43] by the spirit of God not be so hardened
[56:46] that I say well I'm a Christian and
[56:48] you're a heaven but to be able to say
[56:51] Lord this is a soul here and we would be
[56:53] there to take the gospel let that be a
[56:56] tradition that we have that we bring the
[56:58] gospel with us what the prophet of God
[57:00] say the gospel was the life behind the
[57:03] word let us have a tradition of taking
[57:06] the life with us not just simply putting
[57:09] the word in front of people and say here
[57:11] it is you either Believe it or your loss
[57:13] but let there be a life that we carry
[57:16] because we believe the life is important
[57:19] it's not all about Doctrine we need
[57:21] doctrine
[57:23] but it's really not about Doctrine
[57:27] we come as it were to some circumstances
[57:30] on this trip
[57:34] words being said and things happening
[57:38] and people say well that ought not be
[57:42] and another brother says oh one of those
[57:44] traditional clean them before you caught
[57:47] them
[57:48] we don't want to be that way Saints we
[57:50] want people to see Jesus Christ
[57:52] we want them to be here let them be
[57:55] welcome in Grace Tabernacle as they are
[57:58] that they could come and sit and hear
[58:00] the word of God and we're not there
[58:02] telling them everything that's wrong
[58:04] with them but we're projecting Jesus
[58:06] Christ to them and land that life that
[58:09] love of the Gospel come down and God if
[58:12] they are predestinated that will catch
[58:15] them and they will then be Washed by the
[58:18] Water of the word not by our words and
[58:21] so let the word of God come and let us
[58:24] project the love that is in the word and
[58:26] let the word catch them
[58:29] because when the word is catching them
[58:32] they are caught
[58:34] when the word catches a man or a woman
[58:36] they're caught
[58:40] so we look at this as I said we often
[58:43] speak of tradition as a negative but I'm
[58:45] telling you that my life my time in
[58:48] Israel uh something touched me and I
[58:50] realized you know what we actually need
[58:53] some tradition
[58:55] we need some tradition we need if you
[58:58] follow me we need the tradition of
[59:00] preaching pure unadulterated word of God
[59:05] let that become a tradition for us not
[59:08] something that wavers to the right or
[59:10] the left and as I look at this let me
[59:12] just share
[59:14] tradition
[59:15] a way of thinking behaving or doing
[59:18] something that has been used by the
[59:19] people in a particular group family
[59:22] Society for a long time
[59:26] under this context that I hope that
[59:28] you're catching tonight this right here
[59:30] is a tradition let it be used by a group
[59:33] real Christians Believers not for a
[59:36] little season but for a long time
[59:39] let it become the very standard of who
[59:41] we are and what we believe and stand on
[59:44] Amen
[59:46] stories and beliefs that have been a
[59:48] part of a culture of a group of people
[59:50] for a long time used to say that someone
[59:53] has qualities which are like the
[59:55] qualities of another well-known person
[59:56] or group from the past and inherited
[1:00:01] established and customary pattern of
[1:00:04] thought action or behavior
[1:00:09] tradition suddenly not looking so bad is
[1:00:12] it
[1:00:15] and I say myself I've preached often
[1:00:18] tradition is creeping into the message
[1:00:21] well with what God laid on my heart
[1:00:23] there in Israel I'd say God let
[1:00:26] tradition creep into the message let let
[1:00:28] the tradition of your word come in let
[1:00:31] the tradition of Acts 2 38 repent
[1:00:34] let that come in let these things take
[1:00:37] life in us and let it change us not
[1:00:40] man's Traditions now where I need to
[1:00:42] hurry along because I told you I wasn't
[1:00:44] going to keep you long amen second
[1:00:46] Thessalonians the third chapter verses
[1:00:49] one through six
[1:00:50] amen
[1:00:52] finally Brethren pray for us
[1:00:55] that the word of the Lord may have free
[1:00:58] course
[1:00:59] so what is he telling them
[1:01:02] he's pray for me because what we really
[1:01:05] want is not what I thought I should
[1:01:08] preach to you or what things I thought I
[1:01:11] should hold you to but we want to let
[1:01:14] the word of the Lord have free course
[1:01:17] and the word all right keep it in
[1:01:20] context the word be glorified even as it
[1:01:24] is with you see when Christ is in you
[1:01:26] and I my brother and sister then we can
[1:01:29] actually come to a place this is not
[1:01:31] boasting this is not us elevating
[1:01:33] ourselves but we actually can come to a
[1:01:35] place that we are lifted up with the
[1:01:38] word of God in us it is not a place we
[1:01:40] say well I did this or I did that but
[1:01:43] God coming and we are coming to a place
[1:01:45] it's God lifting us up when he answers
[1:01:47] prayer it's God lifting us up when he
[1:01:50] reveals the word to us it's God lifting
[1:01:53] us up my brother and sister when things
[1:01:55] come alive you get excited about the
[1:01:58] word it's there in your life is God
[1:02:00] doing the lifting not man man and can
[1:02:03] make his own boasts amen the prophet
[1:02:05] talks about how it is strange God uses a
[1:02:08] man to do something and he starts
[1:02:10] getting lifted up in his own mind
[1:02:13] but let us be lifted up in the mind of
[1:02:15] Christ
[1:02:16] Amen to be able to stand and somebody
[1:02:18] says oh now you know that was a really
[1:02:21] good service we don't need I this is
[1:02:23] something I I've been catching we don't
[1:02:26] need to stop and say well well you know
[1:02:27] I don't know my brother and sister I'm
[1:02:30] telling you if God LED you as a minister
[1:02:33] to preach a service that touches a
[1:02:35] people and someone comes and says that
[1:02:38] was powerful and it touched my life then
[1:02:40] say praise the Lord
[1:02:42] because it's not a man how can a man be
[1:02:45] thinking the thoughts or doing that I'm
[1:02:48] telling you my brother and sister it's
[1:02:50] time for us God moves in our life we
[1:02:52] find ourselves excited in the word and
[1:02:55] the word is changing our life don't
[1:02:57] apologize for that stand up and say
[1:02:59] thank you Lord then I'm a daughter of
[1:03:01] God thank you Lord I'm a Son of God
[1:03:03] thank you for the word that has come
[1:03:06] down and is changing my life
[1:03:11] because where are you going to go in the
[1:03:12] world today and actually find
[1:03:14] there's a lot of boasters
[1:03:17] a lot of boasters my brother and sister
[1:03:20] but not too many with the mind of Christ
[1:03:23] think how blessed we are
[1:03:25] think how blessed we are
[1:03:29] that God would give us his mind
[1:03:33] his nature
[1:03:37] that we may be delivered from
[1:03:39] unreasonable and wicked men for all men
[1:03:41] have not Faith but the Lord is faithful
[1:03:45] now who's going to establish us on the
[1:03:47] message saint
[1:03:52] Paul is the pastor of Grace am I
[1:03:54] establishing you in the message
[1:03:57] not a chance
[1:03:59] we'll preach the things God lays on our
[1:04:01] heart
[1:04:03] but I can't reach inside someone and
[1:04:06] establish the word
[1:04:08] it's Christ and Christ Alone
[1:04:11] but the Lord is faithful who shall
[1:04:13] establish you and keep you from evil and
[1:04:16] we have confidence in the Lord touching
[1:04:18] you I tell you I believe in that
[1:04:20] probably every preacher ought to make
[1:04:22] sure that he has that as something
[1:04:24] that's anchored in his soul that we
[1:04:26] actually have confidence I don't care
[1:04:28] what position you see the person sitting
[1:04:31] in on the Pew what kind of shambles
[1:04:34] their life is what the outward man
[1:04:36] demonstrates or whatever we should be
[1:04:39] having confidence God's going to
[1:04:40] establish this in them and bring this to
[1:04:43] to the Lord touching them and changing
[1:04:46] them that ye both do and will do the
[1:04:50] things which we
[1:04:51] command you
[1:04:53] boy people have a real problem with that
[1:04:55] in church the other you know I was
[1:04:56] reading an article the other day
[1:04:58] and uh they were listing reasons why
[1:05:00] they would never go back to another
[1:05:01] church it wouldn't go back to a church
[1:05:04] we're going to move on
[1:05:06] and as I'm reading their deal caught my
[1:05:08] attention I'm reading it
[1:05:10] and I thought
[1:05:13] yeah I agree with you
[1:05:15] the problem is
[1:05:17] is you're not looking for a holy
[1:05:19] ghost-filled church
[1:05:21] you're looking for a church
[1:05:23] that will offer you the traditions of
[1:05:27] man
[1:05:29] they're going to offer something that
[1:05:31] validates
[1:05:34] my brother and sister are the only
[1:05:36] validation I want and I believe you want
[1:05:40] is the validation of having the very
[1:05:43] nature the mind and the spirit of God
[1:05:45] there's the validation we're looking for
[1:05:49] we're not looking for a church that
[1:05:51] validates us with the right kind of
[1:05:53] coffee and creamer and donuts and the
[1:05:55] right atmosphere the right lighting the
[1:05:57] right mood
[1:06:00] come on you realize there's now churches
[1:06:02] that have rooms they're mood rooms
[1:06:06] I just
[1:06:08] I just feel like I need to sleep this
[1:06:11] morning and I'll just receive something
[1:06:12] while I'm sleeping they've got a room
[1:06:14] for you
[1:06:16] come on this is not of God
[1:06:19] this is man
[1:06:21] this is man and they're they're creating
[1:06:23] a tradition follow this they're creating
[1:06:26] Traditions to attract the flesh
[1:06:31] I say grace we create a tradition that
[1:06:34] attracts real sons and daughters of God
[1:06:36] that are on fire to serve God let it not
[1:06:40] be based upon how I feel but what does
[1:06:43] the word say let it be a tradition that
[1:06:46] takes us back to scripture takes us back
[1:06:48] to word and makes the word living
[1:06:51] and while the word is judging us
[1:06:54] that leaves you and I we don't need to
[1:06:55] do the work of a judge
[1:06:57] let the word be the judge
[1:07:00] we create an atmosphere where the Holy
[1:07:02] Spirit comes I've shared this story
[1:07:04] about the brother preaching and the lady
[1:07:07] our sister because that's what she is
[1:07:09] today
[1:07:10] third row high heels mini skirt big hunk
[1:07:15] and hoop earrings
[1:07:19] and God's speaking to the brother
[1:07:21] telling him preach on that
[1:07:25] well I tell you that's really difficult
[1:07:27] because mostly As ministers we have
[1:07:29] preached in such fashion and offended
[1:07:31] people
[1:07:33] but the Holy Spirit just kept dealing
[1:07:35] with him preach on it and when she
[1:07:36] walked out of church that night he
[1:07:38] thought well that'll be the last of her
[1:07:39] but the next night she's on the second
[1:07:41] row
[1:07:43] and the Holy Spirit tells him preach on
[1:07:46] that
[1:07:47] and he thinks oh lord I can't preach on
[1:07:49] that
[1:07:51] then she's on the front row
[1:07:53] then she's in the altar
[1:07:55] then she's in the baptismal and then
[1:07:58] she's in the house of God
[1:08:00] but we have to be careful when we look
[1:08:03] at that and say well that is a Formula
[1:08:05] that works
[1:08:06] did God tell us to say that there's the
[1:08:10] difference
[1:08:11] otherwise we can be the one and that you
[1:08:14] see this has happened in many churches
[1:08:16] through the years they walk back to a
[1:08:18] Pew and drag somebody to the altar
[1:08:20] thinking this is going to work
[1:08:24] but you see we should have a moving of
[1:08:27] the holy spirit that brings the people
[1:08:30] to this so we have confidence in the
[1:08:32] Lord touching you that you both do and
[1:08:35] will do the things which we command you
[1:08:37] and the Lord directs your hearts into
[1:08:39] the love of God into a patient waiting
[1:08:41] for Christ now we command you see these
[1:08:44] are strong words but my brother and
[1:08:45] sister every time we read the Bible it
[1:08:48] is commanding us it is telling us what
[1:08:51] we need to do and I say this and I trust
[1:08:54] that you catch this tonight there is the
[1:08:56] tradition of the word the tradition of
[1:08:59] our Lord Jesus Christ is wooing a bride
[1:09:03] amen he's not forcing a bride he is
[1:09:06] wooing a bride let that be the tradition
[1:09:08] of wooing us amen because I tell you
[1:09:11] I've made mistakes in my life and I
[1:09:13] thought up stepped over the line there I
[1:09:16] whatever it might be and God come and
[1:09:18] God's wooing amen I experienced it from
[1:09:21] 15 years old until my mid-30s God
[1:09:24] constantly coming back as much as I
[1:09:26] pushed against it God coming back and
[1:09:28] wooing me back amen that's what we
[1:09:31] desire and we command you brethren in
[1:09:34] the name of our Lord Jesus Christ that
[1:09:36] you withdraw yourselves from every
[1:09:38] brother that walketh disorderly and not
[1:09:40] after the tradition which he received of
[1:09:43] us so here he is speaking now to them
[1:09:46] and saying I'm giving you tradition
[1:09:49] I'm giving you teaching
[1:09:52] I'm giving you Direction
[1:09:54] that you can go back to Time After Time
[1:10:00] but you notice while he says he received
[1:10:03] it of us
[1:10:07] who is actually doing the speaking
[1:10:12] see there's where the difference comes
[1:10:15] other scripture we won't touch it
[1:10:17] tonight
[1:10:18] speaks of the traditions of men
[1:10:22] totally separating from the leadership
[1:10:24] of the Holy Spirit but a tradition of
[1:10:26] man
[1:10:28] amen
[1:10:30] so here's this teaching that Paul is
[1:10:33] giving to them
[1:10:34] First Peter 1 18-25
[1:10:39] amen going back to our original
[1:10:40] scripture
[1:10:44] for as much as you know that you were
[1:10:46] not redeemed with corruptable things as
[1:10:49] silver and gold
[1:10:50] from your vain conversation received by
[1:10:53] tradition from your fathers
[1:10:57] you see my brother and sister if we're
[1:10:59] not careful
[1:11:00] as I use that example of those Jewish
[1:11:02] boys
[1:11:03] being raised by a father
[1:11:06] to
[1:11:08] not be ashamed and to follow
[1:11:11] you know wearing everything that
[1:11:13] pertains to being a very Orthodox Jew
[1:11:18] and their father says you're a boy and
[1:11:20] we can take you back here in Moses and
[1:11:22] do that but do you realize much of what
[1:11:25] they're actually teaching those young
[1:11:27] people
[1:11:28] was not in Moses's teaching
[1:11:32] they added it here
[1:11:34] and they added it here and they added it
[1:11:37] here
[1:11:38] and then as Generations go by
[1:11:42] it is just as good as coming from the
[1:11:44] mouth of God
[1:11:47] there's the traditions we need to be
[1:11:50] careful of
[1:11:52] when we turn the teaching of men
[1:11:56] reminds me I don't say this negative but
[1:11:58] I just want to make this point reminds
[1:12:00] me one time a man said brother Branham
[1:12:02] said this this and this and it struck me
[1:12:05] so so in such a fashion
[1:12:09] I went home and that was back when it
[1:12:11] was Eagle Computing number two or
[1:12:14] something you know the second version
[1:12:16] and there was some things that were you
[1:12:19] couldn't find you you those of you used
[1:12:21] it back then you could type in phrases
[1:12:23] and it just wouldn't come up but you
[1:12:25] knew it was there
[1:12:27] but I remember this man brother Branham
[1:12:29] said
[1:12:31] I went home and I typed it in
[1:12:34] zero
[1:12:36] maybe I didn't type it in right type it
[1:12:39] in this way zero type it in this way
[1:12:42] zero put it on a Shelf
[1:12:46] time goes the search is refined
[1:12:52] come the conclusion no matter how you
[1:12:54] typed it in the prophet never said it
[1:13:00] what are they doing
[1:13:03] they're teaching
[1:13:04] the tradition
[1:13:06] of men
[1:13:09] that's how they saw it
[1:13:12] which kind of fits with the old phrase I
[1:13:15] heard what you said
[1:13:16] but that's not what I heard
[1:13:21] and so we look at this
[1:13:23] we have to be careful
[1:13:25] because it's that Traditions that steer
[1:13:29] people
[1:13:30] nothing wrong with this I actually I I
[1:13:33] don't have any problem with that other
[1:13:34] than the fact I'm wearing some whatever
[1:13:36] this color is shirt
[1:13:40] sister Jerry picked it out
[1:13:43] foreign
[1:13:45] churches that will hardly let you in the
[1:13:48] door
[1:13:49] if you have anything but a white shirt
[1:13:51] on
[1:13:54] reminds me of our Mormon heritage
[1:14:00] yes
[1:14:02] you want to be a para at a Mormon
[1:14:05] funeral
[1:14:06] walk in with a bright blue shirt on and
[1:14:09] a sea of white and black
[1:14:11] not only are they who are you
[1:14:13] but they look at you and it's obvious
[1:14:15] you're not one of them
[1:14:18] now my brother and sister when we come
[1:14:20] to the place of being one of them right
[1:14:22] we sing that song I'm one of them
[1:14:25] what are we talking about
[1:14:27] what are we talking about
[1:14:29] it's not one with this crowd it's not
[1:14:32] one with this great movement it's one
[1:14:35] with Christ
[1:14:36] it's one with the word
[1:14:39] that's what it should be in our
[1:14:42] tradition not the tradition of this I
[1:14:45] know of message church now I'm not
[1:14:47] speaking down but I just want to make a
[1:14:48] point I haven't had a habit of hanging
[1:14:50] out in Mormon churches or Catholic
[1:14:52] churches Message Church won't let you in
[1:14:54] the door with a short sleeve shirt on
[1:14:59] that's their idea of men showing too
[1:15:01] much flesh
[1:15:03] but what is it
[1:15:07] do you have a quote for me
[1:15:10] do you have scripture for me
[1:15:13] no
[1:15:15] it's
[1:15:16] our tradition
[1:15:19] they're teaching it
[1:15:22] have I made my point
[1:15:26] so as we look at this
[1:15:30] the conversation as it says vain
[1:15:33] conversation
[1:15:35] is being passed down by people that are
[1:15:37] not LED of the spirit
[1:15:39] right this is in First Peter 1 and 18.
[1:15:44] amen it's it's not by people led of the
[1:15:47] spirit because if they're LED of the
[1:15:49] spirit they have one absolute right we
[1:15:52] have enough quotes to know where the
[1:15:54] prophet of God stood on absolute we have
[1:15:56] one absolute
[1:15:59] amen so there's what we point back to it
[1:16:02] is not how we feel but what does the
[1:16:06] word say
[1:16:07] amen so it will produce a revelation of
[1:16:12] the word we'll produce the word a
[1:16:15] revelation of a man's tradition will
[1:16:19] preach will produce a people who have
[1:16:22] conformed to man
[1:16:25] now I want to ask you are we here to
[1:16:27] conform to men
[1:16:29] we're here to conform to the word of God
[1:16:31] to the holy ghost moving in our midst
[1:16:33] amen so what happens
[1:16:36] it seems as though you travel the world
[1:16:38] you will run into people
[1:16:40] placing their tradition or man-made idea
[1:16:44] above the word of God
[1:16:47] people placing their man-made things
[1:16:50] above the message
[1:16:52] and so then you realize in that realm
[1:16:55] that they are actually creating a
[1:16:58] tradition that is not designed as it
[1:17:01] were now when I use this word design I I
[1:17:04] say that man is used of God to put
[1:17:07] things in place right and God I just
[1:17:11] throw this out a little bit God's
[1:17:12] dealing with me of things I believe we
[1:17:15] need to do in this church and so it
[1:17:17] takes some form of leadership to say we
[1:17:19] need to start having prayer meeting it
[1:17:21] takes some form of leadership that says
[1:17:23] we need to have Bible study but my
[1:17:25] brother and sister it should not be that
[1:17:28] prayer meeting and bible study or the
[1:17:30] sole structure of man but it is man led
[1:17:34] by God to say we ought to implement this
[1:17:36] in our church and we ought to follow
[1:17:38] this but it won't be man controlling it
[1:17:40] will be the Holy Spirit controlling it
[1:17:42] it will be Christ putting a hunger that
[1:17:45] people and I just put this out here I'm
[1:17:47] not trying to imply anything but you'll
[1:17:49] come because it's God in you that's
[1:17:51] hungering not because you feel obligated
[1:17:55] are you with me
[1:17:57] so it's there in this place that we put
[1:18:00] our ideas higher than the word
[1:18:03] then all we do is produce our ideas
[1:18:06] you know in second Corinthians the third
[1:18:08] chapter
[1:18:11] verses 5 through 18 I'm not going to
[1:18:15] to read all of that I'll probably will
[1:18:17] end up reading all of it but anyway not
[1:18:19] that we are sufficient of ourselves to
[1:18:21] think anything of or as of ourselves but
[1:18:25] our sufficiency is of God
[1:18:28] you talk about a foundation for a
[1:18:30] tradition that the only sufficiency we
[1:18:34] have is of God
[1:18:36] amen what are you going to build on God
[1:18:39] what are you going to do with your life
[1:18:41] God
[1:18:42] where are you going to go God
[1:18:44] let him have complete because that's our
[1:18:47] sufficiency
[1:18:49] who hath also made us Ministers of the
[1:18:52] New Testament not of the letter but of
[1:18:55] the spirit for the letter killeth but
[1:18:57] the spirit giveth life now if we have a
[1:18:59] choice tonight Saints and we're going to
[1:19:01] come and we can give the letter which
[1:19:04] killeth or the spirit what would be our
[1:19:07] desire to give to those around us it
[1:19:10] should be the spirit amen we should be
[1:19:13] saying I want to give life to you and
[1:19:15] the spirit is in the life it is not as
[1:19:18] it was as it days that I come out of my
[1:19:20] childhood legalism didn't work my
[1:19:22] brother and sister it never worked and
[1:19:25] you know what's funny is just visiting
[1:19:27] with different brothers and we are there
[1:19:29] in our time in Israel getting to know
[1:19:31] some of the brothers there our time in
[1:19:34] South Africa and it's there and bumping
[1:19:37] and talking and whatever and it's
[1:19:39] strange you know legalism is legalism no
[1:19:41] matter what continent you're on
[1:19:44] it's legalism and no matter what church
[1:19:47] you're in
[1:19:49] and so it's there in that realm if we
[1:19:52] are got the option to give let's give
[1:19:55] the spirit to people encourage them by
[1:19:58] the word and let the spirit move them
[1:20:00] because otherwise what happens is is we
[1:20:04] can pick this up and say it says right
[1:20:06] here
[1:20:09] and we don't even realize we're killing
[1:20:11] them
[1:20:13] but it says right here we give them
[1:20:16] the spirit introduced them to Christ
[1:20:19] and the word of God gives life to them
[1:20:24] and as we look at this my brother and
[1:20:26] sister I'm not preaching this in any
[1:20:28] form or fashion I am preaching to Paul
[1:20:30] tonight that Paul needs to get into the
[1:20:33] spirit just like God dealt with me about
[1:20:35] tradition tradition tradition coming
[1:20:38] into the message God opens my eyes in
[1:20:40] Israel there and I'm looking and it
[1:20:42] strikes me there are certain traditions
[1:20:44] we need to embrace there are things we
[1:20:47] need to take a hold of and we need to
[1:20:49] let the word be the preeminent thing in
[1:20:51] our life and that let it become as it
[1:20:54] were I hope you're with me the tradition
[1:20:56] that we as a group of Believers stand on
[1:20:59] the word says the word says and we'll
[1:21:02] stand with the word
[1:21:03] I don't need to water it down amen I use
[1:21:06] these as simple examples son forgive me
[1:21:08] if they're just awkward but we don't
[1:21:10] need a coffee bar we don't need donuts
[1:21:13] we don't need some kind of meet and
[1:21:15] greet in the parking lot where they
[1:21:17] can't hardly come to a stop and and
[1:21:19] we've got their door open and we want
[1:21:21] their name and address and email
[1:21:24] because a pastor is going to want to
[1:21:26] greet you later this week and maybe
[1:21:29] invite you for tea
[1:21:31] no sir what we need to do is have the
[1:21:33] presence of Jesus Christ so palatable
[1:21:37] inside this building
[1:21:39] so palatable that people walk in and say
[1:21:42] I've never in my life experienced that
[1:21:47] could we accomplish that Saints
[1:21:49] or should we just give up now
[1:21:52] no sir I'm sorry
[1:21:54] I've come too far to give up now
[1:21:57] amen
[1:21:59] right it says the ministration of death
[1:22:01] written engraved Stones was glorious so
[1:22:03] that the children of Israel could not
[1:22:05] said fastly behold the face of Moses for
[1:22:07] the glory of his countenance which Glory
[1:22:09] was to be done away
[1:22:11] how shall not the menstruation of the
[1:22:14] spirit be rather glorious
[1:22:17] that's what we want to introduce people
[1:22:23] the administration of the spirit
[1:22:26] the most glorious thing could you agree
[1:22:28] with me tonight that meeting Jesus
[1:22:30] Christ face to face as it were is the
[1:22:33] most glorious thing that has ever
[1:22:35] happened to us
[1:22:38] amen there's not one thing amen you know
[1:22:41] it's
[1:22:43] oh my
[1:22:45] let me just move on here
[1:22:47] I find myself just gonna get carried
[1:22:50] away
[1:22:52] now I want to just go Brothers take me
[1:22:54] to the quote from Satan's Eden
[1:22:59] and we'll just wrap this up here
[1:23:01] I believe I've I believe I'm getting my
[1:23:03] point across am i saints
[1:23:05] amen Lord help me to not just be long
[1:23:08] and redundant but
[1:23:11] now I want you to get a clear
[1:23:13] understanding of this so if I could give
[1:23:16] you a little homework
[1:23:17] that you would just go either on a
[1:23:19] device or if you have the book readily
[1:23:21] available just to read before and after
[1:23:23] this to give absolute Clarity to you
[1:23:29] Now by unbelief
[1:23:32] and no
[1:23:34] now I think that no brother Brian might
[1:23:36] have said no but it would make more
[1:23:38] sense in the sentence if it said if
[1:23:40] not
[1:23:42] you follow me
[1:23:44] if no taking all of the word of God
[1:23:46] has brought a seed of unbelief
[1:23:50] so by not taking all the word of God
[1:23:53] it's brought a seed of unbelief Unholy
[1:23:55] sinful hatred and eternal death is in
[1:23:59] this sinful intellectual Church age
[1:24:04] he's talking about right now
[1:24:07] now you got it in this day that when the
[1:24:11] whole world is religious
[1:24:14] it's funny
[1:24:21] I seen the deal recently
[1:24:24] man using the lord's name in vain
[1:24:27] this man has got a Street Ministry just
[1:24:29] walks up and says are you a Christian
[1:24:31] the guy's like yes I am as a matter of
[1:24:33] fact
[1:24:35] and he says do you read your Bible
[1:24:37] and the guy says some
[1:24:41] the guy is pretty blunt
[1:24:43] had a personality to be blunt he says
[1:24:45] maybe you need to find the part about
[1:24:48] taking the lord's name in vain
[1:24:50] and read it
[1:24:54] then he asked the guy this kind of
[1:24:56] personality him do you want me to read
[1:24:58] it to you and the man said
[1:25:00] yes
[1:25:02] and he reads it to him
[1:25:03] and you can see the man is visibly
[1:25:06] shaken
[1:25:09] now Saints where do you go to church
[1:25:13] that you're not even taught
[1:25:16] scripture
[1:25:17] concerning
[1:25:19] how you use the name of the Lord
[1:25:25] I hope you're following me I hope I
[1:25:27] didn't lose you in there
[1:25:29] you're gonna in the whole world's
[1:25:31] religious you know that the whole
[1:25:32] world's religious and in this religious
[1:25:34] age big churches on every corner
[1:25:37] everything the whole thing winds up in
[1:25:40] Satan being worshiped here it is right
[1:25:43] here in the Bible that's right and in
[1:25:46] this intellectual theological seminaries
[1:25:49] that's brought out an intellectual
[1:25:51] person that's been trained how to speak
[1:25:53] what to do how to make their emotions in
[1:25:56] everything like psychology three or four
[1:25:58] years to know how to deal with a man's
[1:26:00] mind
[1:26:03] I tell you what we got some training how
[1:26:06] to deal with man's mind
[1:26:08] amen find an altar pray through
[1:26:10] continually praying through continually
[1:26:13] seeking the mind of God continually
[1:26:16] reading his word continually submitting
[1:26:18] yourself and then you will find God
[1:26:21] dealing with the mind
[1:26:24] not man dealing with the mind the house
[1:26:26] of God should not be a place man deals
[1:26:28] with your mind it is a place that we
[1:26:31] come submit ourselves that the Holy
[1:26:33] Spirit comes and deals with our mind
[1:26:37] that's right
[1:26:38] but you see
[1:26:40] it's easier
[1:26:43] to just approach it intellectually
[1:26:46] will you please change the play page
[1:26:48] brother Gideon
[1:26:50] I like this it's the whole reason I'll
[1:26:52] bring this quote to you right here the
[1:26:53] rest of that was just warming us up
[1:26:56] the spirit of God is not something that
[1:26:59] you
[1:27:00] it's schooled into you is something
[1:27:04] that's predestinated into you by the
[1:27:08] hand of almighty God
[1:27:11] amen not the preacher not the pastor not
[1:27:14] the Evangelist not that whatever my
[1:27:17] brother and sister this this
[1:27:19] understanding of the word this desire
[1:27:21] Amen to come and I've used this term
[1:27:24] tonight to bring it in this way but for
[1:27:27] this to come and become our tradition
[1:27:29] what is our tradition
[1:27:32] um oh Hallelujah a prophet of God said
[1:27:34] repent every single day let that be our
[1:27:38] tradition
[1:27:39] pray every day let that be our tradition
[1:27:42] seek the mind of God and worship him let
[1:27:46] that be our tradition
[1:27:49] oh if we used to ever have a tradition
[1:27:51] let that be our tradition
[1:27:54] let me start again the spirit of God is
[1:27:56] not something that you it's schooled
[1:27:59] into you it's something that's
[1:28:01] predestinated into you by the hand of
[1:28:04] almighty God your experiences cannot be
[1:28:07] schooled or taught into you
[1:28:12] brother Isaac this is why I just was
[1:28:14] thought that was so profound
[1:28:16] nothing
[1:28:18] in this world is going to train us
[1:28:21] to turn to the storm
[1:28:23] and say Lord I'm trusting you I'm going
[1:28:27] to continue to walk I'm going to
[1:28:29] continue to point to Calvary I don't
[1:28:31] care how big this storm is I'm not
[1:28:33] running from it I am pressing into it
[1:28:36] and I am a believer that I am an
[1:28:39] overcomer that you have given something
[1:28:41] into me and the prophet says it right
[1:28:43] here it's not been schooled or taught
[1:28:46] into you it's predestinated by God's
[1:28:49] hand and God's foreknowledge into you
[1:28:53] and I just say thank you Lord Jesus
[1:28:55] because if it could be taught into US it
[1:28:58] could be untaught
[1:29:01] but if it's revealed of the Holy Ghost
[1:29:03] of the Holy Spirit into you and I we
[1:29:06] stand and say this is the word you know
[1:29:09] I I just did this to make a point I've
[1:29:11] done it here at the church before but I
[1:29:13] used it as to make a point when we are
[1:29:15] in Africa and you know you're speaking
[1:29:18] on something a little bit strong and I
[1:29:20] just stopped and I asked them there was
[1:29:22] there was not there was hardly a
[1:29:24] response in the whole church I think
[1:29:26] they just weren't used to that approach
[1:29:28] and I is this a message Church
[1:29:32] people
[1:29:33] yeah
[1:29:35] good
[1:29:37] this is the message
[1:29:40] to the church
[1:29:41] amen
[1:29:43] sometimes it's not about let me just use
[1:29:45] your sister as an example okay is that
[1:29:47] okay not picking on any of you
[1:29:51] but certain things creep in
[1:29:56] and people would be like well they're
[1:29:57] really just
[1:29:58] they're just preaching at me
[1:30:01] or us or them
[1:30:04] but let's stop let's not be judgmental
[1:30:07] let's not say well okay you sisters
[1:30:12] I told the church there Cape Town
[1:30:16] let's just go
[1:30:19] back over here to the word right they
[1:30:21] they admitted their own admission or
[1:30:23] message charge
[1:30:24] let's just go to the message
[1:30:28] and just see what it says
[1:30:32] and let's just do what the message tells
[1:30:33] us to do
[1:30:38] if we were Catholics
[1:30:40] we would be looking in the literature
[1:30:44] and doing what it said
[1:30:46] if we were Baptist
[1:30:50] you see what we need to do is get people
[1:30:53] moved back
[1:30:55] to where the word
[1:30:57] in them that's predestinated
[1:31:00] is in the Forefront
[1:31:02] a place where the word
[1:31:04] becomes the direction of their life the
[1:31:07] Holy Spirit
[1:31:08] because otherwise we become a church of
[1:31:10] do's and don'ts
[1:31:12] we have a tradition
[1:31:15] we're LDS
[1:31:17] we don't do this
[1:31:20] but you know for every one of them we're
[1:31:22] LDS we don't do this we'll be
[1:31:24] a Baptist
[1:31:26] that says we would never dance in the
[1:31:29] middle of our church
[1:31:32] so now they get to Point their finger at
[1:31:34] the LDS
[1:31:35] and the LDS are here pointing their
[1:31:37] finger at them
[1:31:40] how about we sister Ruth if you'll come
[1:31:44] how about we
[1:31:45] don't bother doing any pointing
[1:31:48] but to Christ
[1:31:50] let's point to the word
[1:31:52] what does the word say we are message
[1:31:56] Believers we were called to the word
[1:31:59] let's point to the word let's live the
[1:32:04] word amen I hope I haven't been to
[1:32:08] abrupt to blunt
[1:32:10] or misstated anything tonight
[1:32:14] this is just what God laid on my heart
[1:32:17] while I was sitting in Israel
[1:32:19] amen so you look at that I love that
[1:32:22] last portion paragraph 101 spirit of God
[1:32:25] is not something that you it's schooled
[1:32:27] into you it's something that's
[1:32:29] predestinated into you
[1:32:32] amen so we can call
[1:32:35] the Swan and eagle
[1:32:37] as much as we want to
[1:32:40] we can as we sit there in Israel at some
[1:32:46] kind of a bird refuge the guide says you
[1:32:48] know just want you to see something of
[1:32:50] nature there's this bird refuge there
[1:32:53] that
[1:32:54] um oh they had a number that they
[1:32:56] estimated
[1:32:58] it was in the millions and millions and
[1:33:01] millions and millions of birds every
[1:33:04] year
[1:33:05] funnel through and land at this refuge
[1:33:08] on their way to the south of Africa
[1:33:12] they're just passing through Israel
[1:33:15] they're tourists
[1:33:19] it was kind of an incredible thing all
[1:33:22] kinds of birds there and you know is
[1:33:25] really interesting of all these
[1:33:27] beautiful exotic
[1:33:29] rare birds passing through here
[1:33:33] I look out there
[1:33:35] and Coots
[1:33:37] they just call them a black mud duck
[1:33:41] all right nothing doc about that thing
[1:33:43] that thing eats mud nothing wallers in
[1:33:46] mud that thing likes mud the dirtier the
[1:33:49] water is the happier they are isn't it
[1:33:52] amazing you can find a coot
[1:33:54] almost anywhere in the world
[1:33:57] now my brother and sister
[1:34:00] the fact that the coot is present
[1:34:03] shouldn't let us come to the place we
[1:34:06] don't see the eagle
[1:34:07] [Music]
[1:34:09] don't let all the mud Ducks of the world
[1:34:11] keep us from seeing Christ in our midst
[1:34:13] and moving
[1:34:14] let it be real to us Saints amen God
[1:34:18] bless you tonight
[1:34:20] Hallelujah

[1:37:42] through security and go in sit down find
[1:37:46] something to eat
[1:37:48] instead we find ourselves
[1:37:51] for two and a half hours standing at a
[1:37:53] help desk
[1:37:56] and in that we got to witness people
[1:37:59] coming up
[1:38:00] the Plexiglas forget covid they need
[1:38:03] that to keep the people from climbing
[1:38:05] over the desk in their anger and they're
