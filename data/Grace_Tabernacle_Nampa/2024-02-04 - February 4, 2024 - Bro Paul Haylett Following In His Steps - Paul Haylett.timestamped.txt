[49:10] here today sister April we almost were
[49:14] putting you on Stranger status amen oh
[49:18] my how life can keep us so busy
[49:20] circumstances come amen you know I just
[49:24] want to lift up to you uh we didn't
[49:26] mention Our Sister Sarah just to
[49:28] remember her this morning I don't think
[49:29] we did but uh remember our sister Sarah
[49:32] this morning and also brother Adrien and
[49:35] sister aah there in Montana and uh Wayne
[49:38] and brother Wayne and his family also to
[49:41] remember them it just been having a you
[49:44] might say a little uh um oh I don't even
[49:48] know how to describe
[49:50] it you know a little sentimental moment
[49:53] you know Saints I just look around
[49:55] around us in the in the world we're
[49:57] living in and you know Satan would like
[49:59] to drive a
[50:01] wedge uh he just loves wedges you know
[50:04] if you've ever done much logging or
[50:06] doing you know wedge is a logger's
[50:08] friend and the wedge is the devil's
[50:11] friend and uh you know I just like to
[50:14] Institute almost like a little something
[50:16] not make it some kind of tradition but I
[50:20] would like for us to just uh remember
[50:23] the churches around us last week we
[50:25] prayed for uh Brother Rich in the church
[50:28] there in Monmouth and I would like us to
[50:31] just maybe start as a church just uh you
[50:35] know picking those churches around us
[50:38] and praying for them uh because you see
[50:41] this is this is not just a a solitary
[50:45] we're we're not just the only soldier on
[50:47] the field we're not the only group
[50:49] trying to serve the Lord and let our
[50:51] light shine in the community they're all
[50:54] around us and so as we would go this
[50:56] morning and and um at the reading of the
[51:00] word we'll just close and I would like
[51:02] us to just remember uh I always mess up
[51:05] their name brother John Andes and
[51:09] uh what's the name of their church end
[51:12] time message Tabernacle this will have
[51:15] nothing to do now don't misunderstand
[51:16] what I'm fixing to say but this will
[51:18] have nothing to do with doctrines or
[51:20] this or that I say we remember the body
[51:23] of Believers amen cuz the devil would
[51:26] like to drive the wedge in there where
[51:29] we'd think now you know this in the
[51:31] context of Brother John doesn't apply
[51:34] but the devil would like us to think
[51:35] there's there's some reason we
[51:37] shouldn't but I say because we are
[51:40] believers of the word of God that we
[51:43] should amen that should be elevated and
[51:46] lifted up to remember and as we would
[51:49] look around this morning we should
[51:51] remember each and every one here in this
[51:53] body of Believers whether present this
[51:55] morning or not of the circumstances that
[51:58] are not I don't see sister Dorcas uh
[52:00] this morning but we would just want to
[52:03] remember each and every one I tell you
[52:07] there's nothing
[52:09] like feeling discouraged feeling like
[52:11] you have been beaten down and then
[52:15] something
[52:17] just starts keeping you something just
[52:20] gets a Hal of you and you realize you
[52:24] know what I I I'm
[52:26] I felt discouraged now I feel encouraged
[52:29] and then come to church and have
[52:30] somebody sayou know brother Paul I don't
[52:33] know what you were doing but you know
[52:35] about 2:00 on Friday I just felt led to
[52:38] pray for
[52:40] you and you think
[52:42] back it was
[52:45] 2:00 you think prayers don't matter I'm
[52:48] here to tell you prayers matter amen
[52:51] hallelujah let's turn in our Bibles this
[52:54] morning God bless you and enjoy the song
[52:56] Service First Peter the 2 chapter: 19-
[53:00] 25 I want to speak to you this morning
[53:04] on the overall thought uh we spoke last
[53:08] Sunday on stepping out uh I want to
[53:11] speak
[53:12] today um on following in his steps and
[53:16] we'll just take this thought from the
[53:19] scripture amen you know we were you know
[53:23] in life personality wise God placed
[53:25] certain gifts uh just born in us you
[53:29] know um I I don't want to get too
[53:31] carried away in this but you know you
[53:33] can just look and pick the firstborn in
[53:35] a family often times and then you can
[53:38] pick the middle child and then of course
[53:40] God always Saves The Best For Last so
[53:43] the younger children come along the last
[53:45] amen oh I shouldn't have I shouldn't
[53:48] have ped that I'm sorry um anyway you
[53:51] can usually pick the younger child
[53:53] because they're just setting their
[53:54] weight waiting for someone to wait on
[53:56] them and uh so you know uh it it's just
[54:01] the truth we have to face the truth but
[54:04] you see as we we look at this we realize
[54:08] that God positionally placing us it
[54:11] should actually now come on catch this
[54:14] us being positionally placed by Christ
[54:18] amen yes we should be able to
[54:21] recognize the gift and the placing in
[54:24] our life right and of course being Sons
[54:27] and Daughters of God doesn't give us
[54:29] oldest child middle child youngest child
[54:32] but just one last supporting scripture
[54:34] amen the last shall be
[54:36] first and um the 11th Hour also receives
[54:41] the same pay amen so you look at that
[54:45] and these things are scriptural let's
[54:48] not argue over that but I want you to
[54:51] just look at First Peter the 2 chapter
[54:54] and listen let's just catch this for
[54:57] this is thankworthy if a man for
[55:00] conscious um boy speaking of youngest
[55:04] children they can't see either if a man
[55:06] for conscious toward God endure grief
[55:09] suffering wrongfully for what glory is
[55:12] it if when you have uh when you be
[55:15] buffeted for your faults you take it
[55:18] patiently but if when you do well and
[55:21] suffer for it you take it patiently this
[55:24] is ex acceptable with God for even here
[55:28] unto were ye called because Christ also
[55:31] suffered for us leaving us an example
[55:35] that ye should follow his
[55:38] steps who did no sin neither was guile
[55:42] found in his mouth who when he was
[55:45] reviled reviled not again now we often
[55:50] preach Saints just real I want to insert
[55:52] this we often preach that we need to die
[55:54] to our ourselves you realize how far we
[55:57] have to die yeah when we can come to the
[56:01] place that when you've been despitefully
[56:04] used when you've been reviled that you
[56:07] revile not
[56:11] back
[56:12] amen I hate to admit this because I'm
[56:15] the preacher this morning but I've got a
[56:17] ways to go
[56:21] amen I'm sorry to say it amen but
[56:25] sometimes when you're criticized you
[56:27] immediately start dredging facts on the
[56:30] other but
[56:32] you but
[56:35] you how can you speak to me like that I
[56:39] know about you but how about when we
[56:42] just say thank the Lord praise God
[56:45] hallelujah I've been saved by grace amen
[56:49] he's my judg amen and he says I've
[56:52] already been washed white by his blood
[56:54] Hallelujah
[56:55] there's where we need to
[56:57] look
[57:01] Hallelujah when he was reviled reviled
[57:03] not again when he suffered he threatened
[57:06] not but committed himself to him that
[57:08] judgeth
[57:10] righteously who his own self bear our
[57:14] sins in his own body on the tree that we
[57:17] being dead to sin should live unto
[57:19] righteousness by those stripes ye were
[57:22] healed for ye were as sheep going astray
[57:27] that's it but are now returned into the
[57:29] shepherd and Bishop of your souls amen
[57:32] that just stirs my heart not out there
[57:35] still not identified out there but as
[57:39] having returned back to our correct
[57:43] Place amen with our Shepherd amen
[57:46] heavenly father that's right Lord we
[57:48] just want to lift the church there in
[57:50] Bellingham our brother John Andy father
[57:53] Lord just ask you to Father just just
[57:54] strengthen them as a body of Believers
[57:57] Lord may your grace and mercy give
[57:59] wisdom to them Father may you move in
[58:01] their midst in a supernatural way father
[58:04] that Lord they can be a lighthouse in
[58:06] their Community father and that the
[58:08] lives that would be touched by the
[58:10] preaching of the word father will not be
[58:13] touched for just a moment but be touched
[58:15] for eternity we ask a blessing upon them
[58:18] Father upon their Ministries Lord upon
[58:20] the musicians upon the Saints and the
[58:22] body of Believers father we just send
[58:25] out this Word of Faith Lord bound
[58:27] together with these Saints Lord that you
[58:29] would bless them in the name of Jesus
[58:31] Christ and Lord we ask you to bless the
[58:34] word in this assembly today father as we
[58:36] listen Lord and dig into the word of God
[58:39] may it have an eternal effect on us
[58:41] today we ask this in the name of Jesus
[58:44] Christ amen and amen hallelujah you may
[58:48] be seated
[58:52] Saints I'm trying to break my habit of
[58:54] being being so personal with the church
[58:56] but I I find it very difficult because
[58:59] it is kind of just the way I am but um
[59:02] I'm going to preach to some of these
[59:04] imaginary people that you cannot see
[59:07] this morning amen they're here but you
[59:09] can't see them amen and so it is my
[59:12] brother and sister that often times you
[59:15] know uh we make mistakes Can someone say
[59:19] amen and uh we we do wrong and we make
[59:22] mistakes and uh we'll take the word
[59:24] workplace you know if you make too many
[59:26] mistakes you know they tend to uh start
[59:30] to give you less important uh
[59:32] obligations to take care of positions to
[59:35] do and you know just talking to a a
[59:37] brother uh recently that uh in their
[59:41] business they go uh through a lot of
[59:43] money he he shared with me that a very
[59:45] high volume of money very small margins
[59:48] and and he was talking about how there
[59:50] was an individual that they were going
[59:52] to have to dismiss from their company
[59:55] because he kept making mistakes and it
[59:57] was costing the company uh tremendous
[59:59] amounts of money and so you know we make
[1:00:02] mistakes we suffer for it we we have to
[1:00:05] deal with that there's criticism that
[1:00:07] comes with that and you know it might be
[1:00:10] man you know that wants to remind you it
[1:00:12] might be your wife or it might be your
[1:00:14] husband it might be your parents but
[1:00:16] it's there sometimes this criticism is
[1:00:19] good sometimes this criticism coming
[1:00:21] from Satan is this there to try to beat
[1:00:24] you down to try to keep you from the
[1:00:26] very promise that God has promised you
[1:00:29] maybe a promise that you knew at one
[1:00:31] time in life but but Satan has been
[1:00:33] beating on you and you kind of have lost
[1:00:35] sight of that because of this criticism
[1:00:38] but as you look at this my brother and
[1:00:40] sister uh uh Satan certainly feels
[1:00:43] Justified to point out your mistakes uh
[1:00:46] you know he he's got his Punch coming
[1:00:48] and he's he's pointing this out to you
[1:00:51] now my brother and sister sometimes
[1:00:53] these things have already been placed
[1:00:55] under the blood of Jesus Christ there
[1:00:57] they're not things that you you should
[1:00:59] actually be worrying about they're not
[1:01:01] things that you should uh let Satan
[1:01:03] Buffet you over because it's under the
[1:01:06] blood and when we put it under the blood
[1:01:08] let's not do a half-hearted effort let's
[1:01:10] get it completely under the blood amen
[1:01:12] let's get it to the place that we can
[1:01:14] stand with clear heart and conscience
[1:01:16] before God knowing that we have put it
[1:01:19] where it belongs but Satan he doesn't
[1:01:21] listen he doesn't pay attention he
[1:01:23] doesn't even care
[1:01:25] your opinion means nothing to him in
[1:01:27] fact my brother and sister while he
[1:01:29] knows that the word of God has dominion
[1:01:31] over him as long as we don't apply the
[1:01:34] word Satan's not going to apply it amen
[1:01:37] if we'll sit back and say well I think
[1:01:39] or I hope uh uh you know that uh it will
[1:01:42] be well my brother and sister the
[1:01:43] devil's not going to worry about it
[1:01:46] because if you are sitting there only
[1:01:47] with a half-hearted grip uh on that you
[1:01:51] know it it um it it just is not going to
[1:01:54] make any difference amen but you look at
[1:01:57] this now this constant reminder even
[1:02:00] when we have placed it under the blood
[1:02:01] of Jesus Christ Satan is there to Buffet
[1:02:04] you try to remind you try to get you to
[1:02:07] claim it once again and now you know
[1:02:10] this is why we often times talk about
[1:02:12] how that you should bring things using
[1:02:15] the altar here as an example take things
[1:02:17] in your life lay them on the altar get
[1:02:20] up and walk away now the reason that you
[1:02:22] need a clean bread
[1:02:25] is because Satan will do his best God
[1:02:27] bless you I didn't see you there sir uh
[1:02:30] Satan would like to get you to kind of
[1:02:33] hold on to those things I've laid them
[1:02:35] on the altar but and as it is if Satan
[1:02:38] can convince us to get back to the Altar
[1:02:42] and take a holds of those things again
[1:02:44] in other words condemnation comes in
[1:02:46] that you never feel like you had a
[1:02:48] release from it you you always feel like
[1:02:50] that somehow and and I I have as a
[1:02:53] pastor uh being able to travel different
[1:02:55] places in the world and deal with
[1:02:57] different age groups my brother and
[1:02:59] sister it's kind of amazing to me maybe
[1:03:01] you'll see a young person who's still
[1:03:03] struggling with things that they have
[1:03:05] done in their life and you understand
[1:03:07] they're young and you might say in a
[1:03:08] degree immature but when we have uh
[1:03:12] people that would maybe be considered
[1:03:14] established uh uh they are a little bit
[1:03:17] when I say aged I'm not talking about
[1:03:19] old but they've been around the gospel
[1:03:20] for a while and they're still being
[1:03:23] buffeted by the past they've never made
[1:03:26] that clean break you know it kind of
[1:03:28] tells you that in a way they didn't
[1:03:30] believe that they actually let go of it
[1:03:33] so maybe in an emotional realm they're
[1:03:35] still holding on to something from their
[1:03:37] past and it's a there something that
[1:03:39] they struggle against and I believe all
[1:03:41] of us can identify with that amen I
[1:03:44] certainly can identify with that but you
[1:03:47] know if we'll make the clean break get
[1:03:49] it completely under the blood amen and
[1:03:52] trust God right he said you you put it
[1:03:54] under the blood it's washed so clean I
[1:03:57] don't even remember it oh how precious
[1:04:00] is that that he doesn't even remember it
[1:04:03] amen so why would we remember something
[1:04:06] God decided wasn't worth
[1:04:09] remembering the devil is why we remember
[1:04:12] that's right yes sir just the
[1:04:16] devil and maybe a mean
[1:04:18] neighbor but maybe the mean neighbor is
[1:04:20] just anointed by the devil but I
[1:04:22] wouldn't put that in a context right
[1:04:24] when you don't want to go running around
[1:04:25] a neighbor that's uh you know fussing
[1:04:27] with you over your trash can doesn't
[1:04:29] necessarily mean he's got a devil on him
[1:04:31] so you know you look at this but it's
[1:04:33] there the devil feels Justified to bring
[1:04:37] a constant reminder of
[1:04:40] History a constant reminder to bring
[1:04:43] these things up but I want you to take
[1:04:46] this here we don't want to dwell on that
[1:04:47] too long but you see my brother and
[1:04:50] sister sometimes as the word says here
[1:04:53] we do good
[1:04:55] good see how now the role has been
[1:04:57] completely changed we do good and yet we
[1:05:01] feel punished for doing
[1:05:05] good and in
[1:05:08] that let me back up just a
[1:05:11] hair you see when we suffer having done
[1:05:15] wrong God you might say now pardon me
[1:05:18] I'm just using Paul words today God
[1:05:20] might have pity on
[1:05:22] you but you brought on
[1:05:26] yourself but when you do good and you
[1:05:30] suffer for
[1:05:31] it that's where Satan really gets in
[1:05:35] that's when he gets in there and says oh
[1:05:38] no one
[1:05:39] cares of what I have done that I did it
[1:05:42] for the Lord that I wanted to do and you
[1:05:44] know I'm just going to be real blunt I
[1:05:46] hope I don't hurt anybody's feelings
[1:05:47] today but you know sometimes the offices
[1:05:50] of the church is where uh the devil
[1:05:52] really comes in you know we might be the
[1:05:54] janitor and uh feel very unappreciated
[1:05:58] we might be a trustee feel very
[1:05:59] unappreciated a deacon feel very
[1:06:02] unappreciated be a song leader piano
[1:06:04] player musician feel very unappreciated
[1:06:08] and maybe somebody comes along speaking
[1:06:09] of musicians you know and they just have
[1:06:12] to I'm so glad I'm toned
[1:06:15] deaf I'm so glad because they got a
[1:06:18] really blunder before brother Paul
[1:06:19] figures out the musicians blunder I mean
[1:06:22] you know almost like the
[1:06:24] [Music]
[1:06:25] hey I I think something's wrong here but
[1:06:29] you see every office and right up to the
[1:06:32] ministry we can be doing good and
[1:06:35] there'll be something that will come
[1:06:37] because Satan wants you to use or lose I
[1:06:41] mean the Victory and the joy you had in
[1:06:45] your faithful service to God
[1:06:47] Amen serve God for 10 15 20 30 years and
[1:06:52] then suddenly you might be I got to be
[1:06:54] careful when I word it this way but you
[1:06:56] know we become a little more aged to the
[1:06:58] point that the young people look
[1:07:01] older and it's there that we would come
[1:07:03] and all of a sudden there's a big bump
[1:07:05] in the road and then all of a sudden the
[1:07:07] devil's like well that's because and if
[1:07:10] we'll listen to the devil he can
[1:07:12] literally steal our joy from us when we
[1:07:15] are doing our very best to serve God he
[1:07:18] doesn't care what our position is he's
[1:07:21] here to steal kill and
[1:07:24] Destroy but we my brother and sister you
[1:07:27] know just uh studying just reading this
[1:07:30] is the reason that we must get ourselves
[1:07:32] in a position and get sealed with the
[1:07:34] Holy Ghost amen cuz that is your only
[1:07:37] hope amen Ezekiel is that I think
[1:07:40] Ezekiel 4 or 6 six and and it's there he
[1:07:45] tells them go don't bring death or
[1:07:47] judgment on the city until you've gone
[1:07:49] through the city and sealed all of those
[1:07:53] my my brother and sister then once they
[1:07:55] are sealed judgment can come and I say
[1:07:58] today that's why we should just stop and
[1:08:00] say Lord what I need today is not some
[1:08:04] profound Revelation to quote scripture
[1:08:06] quote quotes uh to be of this or to be
[1:08:09] of that but Lord what I need is sealed
[1:08:12] because when I'm sealed the Judgment
[1:08:14] that's coming will not be judging me I
[1:08:16] can stand with confidence and the devil
[1:08:18] will try to erode that confidence but
[1:08:20] let's just go back to the word amen and
[1:08:24] the word said amen that's all you got to
[1:08:26] answer it worked for our lord Jesus we
[1:08:28] don't have to defend and come up with
[1:08:30] all kinds of things quote all kinds of
[1:08:31] quotes and scriptures we need to just go
[1:08:33] back the word says amen and I'm sealed
[1:08:37] and the word says that being sealed I'm
[1:08:39] be on the Judgment that is coming that's
[1:08:42] what I desire that's what I long for
[1:08:45] Hallelujah so we'll look at this you
[1:08:47] know sometimes in doing good amen we get
[1:08:51] buffeted but when we do well and suffer
[1:08:55] for it and you take it patiently oh now
[1:08:58] listen to me Saints I'm not being
[1:09:00] critical this morning but it's hard to
[1:09:02] take it patiently when you know you've
[1:09:04] done your best and your best lines with
[1:09:07] the word and then you're still
[1:09:10] criticized it's hard to take it patient
[1:09:12] can anybody tell tell me that's the
[1:09:15] truth amen amen amen amen amen for those
[1:09:18] of you who didn't say anything so you
[1:09:20] look at this my brother and sister
[1:09:21] there's when great Trials come when you
[1:09:24] know that you have done your best you're
[1:09:26] lined up with the word of God you're not
[1:09:28] looking at this as though I'm just going
[1:09:30] to check the boxes and therefore
[1:09:33] everything's well but you know and you
[1:09:35] can from the heart say all is well all
[1:09:38] is well I've got a prayer life I'm
[1:09:40] reading the word God is answering my
[1:09:42] prayer I'm seeing it in the word and and
[1:09:44] he's changing me Can someone say thank
[1:09:47] you Lord for changing me oh what a thing
[1:09:50] my brother and sister don't want to be
[1:09:52] 40 years reminds me of a man I knew in
[1:09:54] my childhood wonderful man good
[1:09:56] character but you know even as a kid I
[1:09:59] often wondered you know uh what is what
[1:10:02] is uh this man getting out of church
[1:10:05] because literally the song service would
[1:10:07] be over they would read scripture they
[1:10:10] would be seated and he leaned against
[1:10:12] the wall and slept through the whole
[1:10:15] service and I'm not judging him we
[1:10:18] understand now things like sleep apnea
[1:10:20] and different things like that he was a
[1:10:21] very hardworking man but you see my
[1:10:24] brother and sister just being in the
[1:10:25] house of God is more than attendance
[1:10:29] that's right amen there's got to be a
[1:10:31] outpouring of the word but there has to
[1:10:34] be more than just an outpouring of the
[1:10:36] word because we can read the word and
[1:10:38] say we've got the word but there has to
[1:10:40] be an outpouring of the spirit and the
[1:10:42] only way that there can be an outpouring
[1:10:44] of a spirit in that second to last song
[1:10:46] brother Isaac sang there I was just
[1:10:48] thinking yes this is a time for us to
[1:10:50] lift our hands and say Lord here I want
[1:10:53] you to stop stop by right here Lord I
[1:10:55] want you to fill me right here Lord I I
[1:10:57] don't want you to just sweep over the
[1:10:59] church Lord I need you to stop right
[1:11:02] here that's right and when you stop
[1:11:04] right here I will be changed because
[1:11:07] I've got that
[1:11:09] Universal
[1:11:10] surrender
[1:11:15] amen and so as we look at
[1:11:19] this I don't know why I would bring this
[1:11:22] up but maybe it's relevant only to
[1:11:25] me but God's going to keep trying our
[1:11:27] patience till we can fulfill this
[1:11:30] scripture right
[1:11:32] here that these things happening around
[1:11:34] us that we can take it
[1:11:36] patiently that we can stop now patiently
[1:11:39] my brother and sisters not the cop out
[1:11:41] well whatever the Lord wants will just
[1:11:43] happen and I don't have to be a
[1:11:45] contributor right no no no go through
[1:11:49] your Bible you'll find there's a lot of
[1:11:51] places if you to put it in context of
[1:11:53] our Modern English a lot of places say
[1:11:56] action required here right almost like
[1:11:58] when you go to the attorney right you go
[1:12:00] to the taxman they put these little
[1:12:02] things that says sign here well how
[1:12:05] about one that says action required here
[1:12:07] you would go through the Bible if you
[1:12:09] took your Bible you would be filling
[1:12:11] your Bible full of those little Post-it
[1:12:14] pointy arrows saying action required
[1:12:17] here action required here action
[1:12:18] required here amen there's an action
[1:12:21] required from you and me but it's
[1:12:23] nothing you've done that's right it's
[1:12:26] all what he's done amen amen amen
[1:12:29] sometimes the Holy Spirit just wants us
[1:12:31] maybe to lift a hand and amen say come
[1:12:35] by here Lord come by here cuz remember
[1:12:39] he's a gentleman amen yes exactly right
[1:12:42] you never seen a man or a woman that won
[1:12:44] the lottery where they had to drag him
[1:12:46] up there to get the
[1:12:49] check and that is so
[1:12:52] temporal that is so
[1:12:55] earthy statistically speaking in 7 to 12
[1:12:59] years they'll be bankrupt and their life
[1:13:02] will be worse than it was when they won
[1:13:05] that's
[1:13:06] right and I'm not saying this
[1:13:08] judgmentally I'm saying to make a point
[1:13:10] but in church we almost have to beg
[1:13:14] that's exactly right come and get
[1:13:16] something greater than you've ever had
[1:13:19] in your life yeah please come yes you
[1:13:24] never see a lottery winner like that no
[1:13:27] sir they're up there they're so happy to
[1:13:29] have that even though the majority of
[1:13:31] them will turn into drugs
[1:13:33] alcohol and whatever and their life
[1:13:36] messed up am Satan's so clever isn't he
[1:13:40] I say Satan is very clever and that's
[1:13:42] why the scripture tells us to actually
[1:13:44] have respect for him sometimes you hear
[1:13:46] people say I'm just going to stomp on
[1:13:48] that devil well you better make sure you
[1:13:50] got him on the ground first that's right
[1:13:52] amen you might be talking about all the
[1:13:55] Stomping you want to talk about if you
[1:13:57] ain't got him under your feet first
[1:13:59] don't go boasting about The Stomping
[1:14:01] amen so take the word amen by the word
[1:14:05] conquer amen amen so as we look at this
[1:14:08] we realize that you know in this case or
[1:14:11] this example of the scripture when we do
[1:14:14] good and there is criticisms and
[1:14:16] struggles that come with it and we take
[1:14:19] that patiently without reviling that
[1:14:21] this is acceptable with God and in our
[1:14:24] human thinking we would want to turn
[1:14:25] that around almost you know and and and
[1:14:28] be justified but you know my brother and
[1:14:30] sister it is as we come down through the
[1:14:32] scripture here uh I I I have to own up
[1:14:36] you know in in our world and I hope you
[1:14:38] don't mind a natural example uh you know
[1:14:41] there's times that we make decisions out
[1:14:43] on the farm and uh you know six months
[1:14:46] later you look back and say why in the
[1:14:48] world did we do that you you can't even
[1:14:51] justify that you can't even in your own
[1:14:53] mind explain to yourself why you did
[1:14:56] that but the thing is you're better off
[1:14:58] to own
[1:14:59] it don't try and blame
[1:15:02] it my brother and I sometimes joke the
[1:15:05] reason we have Partners I have him he
[1:15:07] has me is we have somebody to blame it
[1:15:09] on yeah but you see my brother and
[1:15:12] sister you can't do that you need to own
[1:15:14] it so you know what I'm going to own
[1:15:17] when I do things right and there's
[1:15:19] criticisms when I do things according to
[1:15:22] the word of God and other people uh uh
[1:15:25] don't agree other people view it as some
[1:15:27] kind of uh you know Calamity that you
[1:15:30] did justifying for your own benefit or
[1:15:33] this that and the other my brother and
[1:15:34] sister just to learn to sit down and
[1:15:37] patiently say Lord I prayed about that
[1:15:40] now not some half-hearted prayer we have
[1:15:42] a joke around our house you know the
[1:15:44] joke about where the the young Minister
[1:15:46] he went to a big conference and um you
[1:15:49] know when he was at the conference he
[1:15:51] got up and he spoke and he comes home
[1:15:52] from this and he's telling his wife I I
[1:15:55] I preached you know there was just
[1:15:56] thousands of people there it was so
[1:15:58] wonderful I preached and and then I had
[1:16:00] a meeting with all of the council
[1:16:02] afterwards and they as offered me the
[1:16:05] pastorial ship of that
[1:16:08] church and the wife said what are you
[1:16:11] going to do and he said well I'm going
[1:16:13] to pray while you
[1:16:19] pack that's not real prayer no that's
[1:16:25] amen you're sitting at the car dealer
[1:16:28] with an ink pin in your hand and just
[1:16:30] before the ink pen hits the page Lord
[1:16:32] should I buy this car or
[1:16:35] not your only hope is is that the paper
[1:16:37] tears and the pen won't
[1:16:40] right you should have that settled
[1:16:42] before you ever went to the car lot
[1:16:45] there's a lot of things we ought to have
[1:16:46] settled before we ever take the first
[1:16:49] step into it so we can't say well I did
[1:16:53] and I feel as though there's a
[1:16:55] tremendous no you didn't do your
[1:16:56] diligence we're called to do diligence
[1:16:59] amen hallelujah so you look at this we
[1:17:02] do good we do the right things and you
[1:17:03] suffer for it sometimes man will be the
[1:17:06] one that tries to rub it in sometimes
[1:17:08] it's the devil amen but the Lord will
[1:17:11] allow these things to take place because
[1:17:13] he's molding our character that we'll
[1:17:16] come to the place that we want to be
[1:17:18] acceptable of God more than anything
[1:17:22] else
[1:17:23] this is not now I hope I'm not too blunt
[1:17:25] today we have some company forgive me
[1:17:27] but I don't really care what you
[1:17:29] think I care what he thinks that's right
[1:17:32] amen amen what happens in the criticisms
[1:17:34] that come with this I want him to say
[1:17:37] Well done my good and faithful servant
[1:17:39] you might not ever say Well done Paul
[1:17:41] but if he says well done all is well
[1:17:45] amen so that's the steps that we have to
[1:17:47] take is to not look around for public
[1:17:50] opinion that's right my brother and
[1:17:52] sister when we get into the realm of
[1:17:54] public opinion we have to start almost
[1:17:57] then having a little bit of a a
[1:17:59] discussion and the discussion comes and
[1:18:02] you know I find this interesting I hope
[1:18:04] this is not too personal but discussions
[1:18:06] can be influenced by who gives the most
[1:18:08] money to the
[1:18:10] church they're worth two
[1:18:13] votes and their wife is worth two votes
[1:18:16] and their children are worth two votes
[1:18:19] so the rest of you might as well stay
[1:18:21] home
[1:18:23] what do you end up with a political
[1:18:25] church that's right not a gospel church
[1:18:29] a political church that's why the gospel
[1:18:31] says keep all of that trash out of here
[1:18:34] right amen keep all of that outside the
[1:18:36] doors outside the walls of the assembly
[1:18:40] let it only be God's voice that gives
[1:18:42] Direction on the inside amen and that's
[1:18:45] why we pray about these things that's
[1:18:47] why we stand solidly before the Lord
[1:18:50] Lord what do you want me to do that's
[1:18:52] right amen amen now you know when we
[1:18:55] look at this my brother and sister when
[1:18:57] it comes to the things that uh we take
[1:19:00] patiently to find it acceptable of
[1:19:04] God when it doesn't all go well
[1:19:09] yeah you've prayed you've followed the
[1:19:11] word still get
[1:19:14] criticized I think we're Justified
[1:19:16] aren't we start a little reverse
[1:19:18] political
[1:19:19] campaign it's not my fault it's their
[1:19:22] fault
[1:19:23] what did our lord Jesus answer that
[1:19:25] equation with Lord forgive them they
[1:19:29] know not what they do
[1:19:32] amen oh help us to apply that hallelujah
[1:19:37] amen I I'm going to just use Brother
[1:19:39] David sister Dian sister Ruth for an
[1:19:41] example real quick maybe they clean the
[1:19:43] church but they forget the garbage can
[1:19:45] in The Minister's
[1:19:48] office is this some kind of subliminal
[1:19:51] message
[1:19:56] no sir sir no sir and if you readily
[1:20:00] hold to Lord forgive them they know not
[1:20:05] what they did with the trash
[1:20:08] can I use that as a light-hearted
[1:20:10] example right because some might get
[1:20:13] serious quick right stepping off the
[1:20:15] ledge into the deep end of the
[1:20:17] pool but you see my brother and sister
[1:20:20] if we start to embrace that approach
[1:20:23] where does Satan get his foot in the
[1:20:25] door that's right he can't get his foot
[1:20:27] in the door because no matter what
[1:20:29] happens we're standing there saying Lord
[1:20:32] if it was an accident it's an accident
[1:20:34] if it was intented but Lord forgive them
[1:20:36] anyhow regardless of what was what
[1:20:39] forgive them anyhow Lord and if we'll
[1:20:41] step into that realm people can insult
[1:20:43] you degrade you cut you down to your
[1:20:46] back or to your face and all you'll be
[1:20:48] doing is saying Lord I'm just going to
[1:20:51] accept this I'm going to take it and
[1:20:52] forgive them
[1:20:54] Lord now they may never ever be blessed
[1:20:57] by that but you will be that's right
[1:21:00] absolutely you'll walk with a liberty in
[1:21:02] Jesus Christ like you never walked in
[1:21:04] your life and I'm going to go off into a
[1:21:06] deep end of a pool maybe this goes about
[1:21:09] 25 30 40 years my brother and sister of
[1:21:12] maybe it was a preacher even insulted
[1:21:15] you or spoke ill of you or did all of
[1:21:17] those things and it left a mark upon you
[1:21:20] I've got some of those marks in my own
[1:21:22] life and have been Slowly by the grace
[1:21:24] of God rooting them out because I will
[1:21:27] not be hindered by those things that
[1:21:29] happened back there because I want to
[1:21:32] live in the present right now the
[1:21:35] spirit's moving he's here this morning
[1:21:37] and I want to walk in that not looking
[1:21:40] backwards oh I would if no forget the
[1:21:43] ifs I'm living right here in the
[1:21:45] presence of the king yes and the Devil
[1:21:48] he's over there doing double time
[1:21:50] digging up the bones the dead body he's
[1:21:53] trying to dig it up keep you from doing
[1:21:55] what do we do Lord forgive them anyhow
[1:21:58] forgive them anyhow Lord I'm just going
[1:22:00] to patiently wait father you'll do the
[1:22:02] work you'll touch the
[1:22:04] lives cuz I'll tell you the lives you
[1:22:06] think you can touch will be the lives
[1:22:09] that you muddy that's right exactly
[1:22:12] right
[1:22:17] yeah so you know I need to hurry along
[1:22:20] here oh just so you know the song
[1:22:23] service was 11 minutes longer so when
[1:22:27] you guys start counting time I've still
[1:22:28] got 11 more minutes sorry about that
[1:22:31] brother
[1:22:32] Isaac just say it just saying so verse
[1:22:35] 21 tells us for even here unto were you
[1:22:38] called because Christ also suffered and
[1:22:41] let's move the O and make it personally
[1:22:43] suffered for you amen CU whenever you
[1:22:47] have two people in the car you can
[1:22:48] always keep throwing the blame to the
[1:22:50] one beside you so let's take it from the
[1:22:52] US not changing scripture but he died
[1:22:56] for you amen just keep that as a central
[1:22:59] part of your mind you got nowhere to
[1:23:01] toss it he died for me he was on the
[1:23:04] cross because of Paul he was on the
[1:23:06] cross and suffered everything that he
[1:23:08] suffered to take my sin so that I can
[1:23:11] stand here today before you and say in
[1:23:14] Jesus Christ I am righteous amen without
[1:23:18] that I'd be a hypocrite to say those
[1:23:19] words but he took it that's right and if
[1:23:22] he takes it it's taken it's settled it's
[1:23:25] finished it's done it's out of man's
[1:23:28] remembrance it's finished hallelujah
[1:23:31] amen amen now look we all know the
[1:23:35] little poem on the footprints on the
[1:23:37] sand of time my brother and sister it's
[1:23:40] one thing as that little poem lays out
[1:23:42] it's one thing to follow his footsteps
[1:23:44] but I can tell you every one of us has a
[1:23:46] stage in our life where we weren't
[1:23:48] following footsteps we were being
[1:23:49] carried that's right amen and it is
[1:23:52] isn't two toes being drugg in the sand
[1:23:56] where he's got a hold of your hair or
[1:23:58] your hand dragging you along he picked
[1:24:01] us up he carried us he took us to the
[1:24:04] Finish amen and Satan wants us to forget
[1:24:08] that sir and he wants us to turn
[1:24:11] religion into just like an event like
[1:24:13] the Kanas and if anybody's a kanana I
[1:24:16] don't mean to say bad on that amen but
[1:24:19] uh you know uh it's it's you know just
[1:24:22] something we do yeah
[1:24:26] it I don't know if it's the quanas or
[1:24:28] not it's one of those Elks one of some
[1:24:30] deal like that I remember reading that
[1:24:32] you're only required to come to one
[1:24:35] meeting a
[1:24:38] year some people got confused and
[1:24:40] thought that was their
[1:24:44] Church my brother and sister you know
[1:24:48] little arrow action required here yes
[1:24:53] amen are we doing
[1:24:55] okay okay so we we're supposed to follow
[1:24:59] in his steps
[1:25:04] now as you look at this we we'll see my
[1:25:07] brother and sister that sometimes uh as
[1:25:10] we we look at what our lord Jesus has
[1:25:13] done for us I think we fail to catch the
[1:25:16] real moving of the spirit the real
[1:25:19] revelation of what it is yes sir because
[1:25:22] without the action on his part you say
[1:25:24] brother Paul this is so simplistic but
[1:25:26] uh the scripture does say we're supposed
[1:25:28] to be as ministers stir up your pure
[1:25:31] minds and that also
[1:25:33] includes Simplicity yes sir because if
[1:25:38] it wasn't there some of us with our IQ
[1:25:40] marked on the post where it's
[1:25:42] at
[1:25:44] would not be making
[1:25:47] it I don't say that as any
[1:25:50] understatement see it's just
[1:25:53] if it had to come to Pure
[1:25:56] intelligence there'd be just a lot of
[1:25:58] people wouldn't make
[1:26:02] it but I'm going to turn that around he
[1:26:06] said it come down to
[1:26:09] Faith pure faith and unfortunately some
[1:26:13] are not going to make it that's right
[1:26:15] right because to them it's got to be
[1:26:17] deeper than that that's right it's got
[1:26:19] to be more
[1:26:20] intellectualized and that's fine you
[1:26:22] know our brother Mark down in Arizona
[1:26:24] wrote that book and and uh I made it
[1:26:27] about halfway through and I I was just
[1:26:28] like I I I just gave up on it words were
[1:26:31] so big I was reading it one hand in a
[1:26:33] dictionary and one hand in his book and
[1:26:35] and you know I just thought I'm a
[1:26:37] failure but I just can't deal with this
[1:26:38] any longer I I understand the point he's
[1:26:40] making he wrote this for people whose IQ
[1:26:43] is double digit uh and uh you know uh
[1:26:48] I'm I'm just going on and one day I was
[1:26:50] talking now this is going to sound sound
[1:26:52] a little snarky of me but I was talking
[1:26:54] with another Minister another Pastor in
[1:26:55] the message and that book got brought up
[1:26:57] and I said I only made it half through
[1:26:59] and he said I made it through the first
[1:27:00] chapter and I felt better about
[1:27:06] myself should I probably not because I'm
[1:27:10] just a sinner saved by
[1:27:13] grace but we're
[1:27:16] human so you look at this as we follow
[1:27:20] he didn't do any sin he took s amen he
[1:27:24] was reviled and he suffered he was
[1:27:27] threatened but he did not
[1:27:31] retaliate my i' we've got a lofty goal
[1:27:34] to reach to Saints a very lofty Ro goal
[1:27:38] to reach to amen and so is there that
[1:27:42] this scripture also declared that by his
[1:27:44] stripes it's right here by his stripes
[1:27:47] were healed and I find it interesting
[1:27:49] then in us doing good and being revived
[1:27:52] us being uh doing good and and uh you
[1:27:56] know under this influence of of uh being
[1:27:58] reviled to retaliate and do do all this
[1:28:01] and then right in there's
[1:28:03] healing they must have when they edited
[1:28:06] this somehow got it on the wrong
[1:28:10] page you know why a lot of people don't
[1:28:13] have their
[1:28:15] healing because they have underlying
[1:28:18] currents of
[1:28:20] spirits that are going out here they
[1:28:24] believe they believe in healing they
[1:28:27] pray for healing but they have anger or
[1:28:30] bitterness or disappointment that takes
[1:28:33] them to the edge of
[1:28:37] bitterness and they don't relate the
[1:28:39] two this is why healing shows up right
[1:28:42] here in this chapter because we have to
[1:28:45] come to the
[1:28:48] place there is no reaction
[1:28:56] state of North Carolina there's a deacon
[1:28:59] in a church there as close as we get to
[1:29:02] description pretty good sized brother
[1:29:05] come out of a rough life as a Young
[1:29:08] Man married lovely family asked to be a
[1:29:12] deacon in the
[1:29:13] church one night a man comes angry that
[1:29:17] his wife is attending that church
[1:29:20] now the man gets
[1:29:22] physical I guess you'd say violent
[1:29:25] strikes this brother in the
[1:29:28] face and the brother said about the time
[1:29:32] my fist was about an inch from his
[1:29:35] face it
[1:29:41] stopped then he
[1:29:43] realized I'm not the answer that's right
[1:29:47] he is that's right and he got on his
[1:29:50] knees right there in the fo La of their
[1:29:52] church and repented crying out with
[1:29:54] bitter
[1:29:56] tears Lord that's not who I am that's
[1:30:00] the Lord amen amen I'm a Son of God
[1:30:04] Amen and he said the Lord right there
[1:30:07] took that from him never ever
[1:30:10] again people push him insult him call
[1:30:13] him names and he said by that time God's
[1:30:17] work I could just stand
[1:30:19] there and take it yeah
[1:30:22] threaten any of the Lambs and sheep in
[1:30:26] the assembly I'll be the lion of
[1:30:29] Judah threaten my pastor I'll be the
[1:30:32] lion of Judah strike me in the face for
[1:30:35] what I believe and you'll find me
[1:30:38] standing there
[1:30:40] unmovable Lord help us that's right Lord
[1:30:43] help us remember Jesus was injured in
[1:30:46] the house of his friends that's right
[1:30:49] and so sometimes we have to just
[1:30:52] recognize that so you know he be bore
[1:30:54] our sins in his body on a tree and uh
[1:30:58] that we being dead to sin should live by
[1:31:01] righteousness whose Stripes you were
[1:31:03] healed for we were as sheep going astray
[1:31:06] but are now returned into the shepherd
[1:31:08] and Bishop of our souls I tell you what
[1:31:10] I want to do I want to come to a church
[1:31:12] that has that kind of atmosphere I want
[1:31:14] to come into the house of God and
[1:31:16] experience that kind of atmosphere not
[1:31:19] just in you or you but I want it in me
[1:31:22] amen I want to have that kind of
[1:31:24] atmosphere as a control center of my
[1:31:27] life amen atmosphere of grace and mercy
[1:31:31] it's much easier to judge though judging
[1:31:33] can be an instantaneous response
[1:31:36] sometimes Mercy requires us to stop and
[1:31:39] say Lord thy will be done
[1:31:44] amen but I want to go to a church that's
[1:31:47] not only just a atmosphere like that but
[1:31:51] I want to go to a a church has got an
[1:31:52] atmosphere of
[1:31:54] strength
[1:31:56] amen you see
[1:31:58] pacifists many religions are built
[1:32:00] around being
[1:32:03] pacifist they're not going to strike
[1:32:07] anybody but they don't have spiritual
[1:32:10] strength that's right amen they don't
[1:32:12] have spiritual courage that's it they
[1:32:14] don't have Revelation that's right so it
[1:32:17] takes more than just being pacif that's
[1:32:20] right we need to be able to stand boldly
[1:32:24] that's right scripture talks about
[1:32:26] standing boldly amen amen I'm not
[1:32:29] talking about standing on the corner at
[1:32:31] the intersection with a sign that's not
[1:32:33] bold my brother and sister in fact many
[1:32:36] of those people are deterrence to people
[1:32:38] accepting the gospel amen but if we
[1:32:41] could step into a position of strength
[1:32:43] and courage and
[1:32:45] optimism is optimism a word that's
[1:32:48] active in our
[1:32:50] church are we the one when people go
[1:32:53] well where do you go to
[1:32:55] church
[1:32:57] well we go down that little Brick Church
[1:32:59] on Midland it's not
[1:33:02] much there's only just a few of
[1:33:05] us we we know we're just if you don't
[1:33:08] come you haven't missed
[1:33:11] anything well I'm sure people are going
[1:33:13] to just jump up and down I want to go to
[1:33:15] that church I want to have that kind of
[1:33:18] enthusiasm for the
[1:33:20] gospel
[1:33:22] what do you have for blankets and
[1:33:24] pillows no sir yeah that's right problem
[1:33:29] about the coffee Brother David is well
[1:33:31] we W to go
[1:33:34] there pretty soon the church would be
[1:33:36] empty unless you all like apple fritters
[1:33:38] because that's the only thing we would
[1:33:41] serve look my brother and sister there
[1:33:44] ought to be an optimism I'm not boasting
[1:33:46] but I want to just give you an example
[1:33:48] I'm in Home Depot the other day looking
[1:33:50] to buy a little short step stool ladder
[1:33:53] you know the ones that one-sided Three
[1:33:55] Little Steps got the top folds up flat

[1:37:52] want a courage bold to stand and say if

[1:37:57] and then have a man say you know what we
[1:38:00] believe in healing boom I hear the door
[1:38:03] slam open amen let's be that kind of
[1:38:07] believer let's create that kind of
[1:38:10] atmosphere let's bring that kind of
[1:38:12] results that's guaranteed by the word no
[1:38:15] hindrances that's right you got to leave
[1:38:17] bitterness at the door you got to B
[1:38:19] leave frustration at the door you got to
[1:38:22] leave all of that history at the
[1:38:25] door this is a new day in the Lord this
[1:38:28] is a fresh time to serve God the past be
[1:38:32] the past and let us live here in the
[1:38:34] present and look to the future of the
[1:38:36] moving of the Holy Spirit
[1:38:39] Hallelujah my I'm already past time and
[1:38:42] I haven't even made it what might you
[1:38:44] call the first
[1:38:47] page Ephesians 6 amen
[1:38:54] we'll just jump right down I had more
[1:38:55] scripture there we jump down to verse 13
[1:38:58] wherefore take unto you the whole armor
[1:39:00] of God you realize how important that is
[1:39:04] Saints amen we can we can buckle on the
[1:39:08] helmet we can buckle on the shin
[1:39:11] guards but it might not do anything for
[1:39:14] you that might not be where the enemy
[1:39:16] strikes you you know he often times he
[1:39:21] like to go for the head if he can muddy
[1:39:24] up our thinking then he's muddied us
[1:39:27] up but I want you to think about it this
[1:39:30] way I don't want to skewer this help me
[1:39:35] Lord mostly our issues are issues of the
[1:39:39] heart yes sir yes sir that's exactly
[1:39:48] right Youth Camp youth con convention
[1:39:53] Belgium
[1:39:57] individual or Pastor
[1:39:59] backslid
[1:40:01] right get rid of the shepherd you get to
[1:40:04] scatter the
[1:40:08] Sheep it's obvious this had impacted
[1:40:11] this
[1:40:15] individual I said
[1:40:17] okay what from
[1:40:19] there
[1:40:21] my
[1:40:23] parents and one of my brothers and half
[1:40:26] of our church all backslid they're out
[1:40:28] in the world
[1:40:37] now if I killed over dead or you found
[1:40:41] out tomorrow I was a drunk in an alley
[1:40:42] in this
[1:40:44] city do not use that as an excuse that's
[1:40:47] exactly right don't say well a title
[1:40:51] wave tore down our house build another
[1:40:55] house amen build the house you got
[1:40:58] stronger build it in the right place the
[1:41:01] right
[1:41:05] atmosphere and this little
[1:41:07] girl she's
[1:41:09] grieving she's
[1:41:14] grieving but God's right on time amen
[1:41:18] hallelujah God's right on the time
[1:41:22] you know what my brother and sister you
[1:41:25] see you can't say you trust if you don't
[1:41:29] that's it and you can't take the words
[1:41:32] of trust and turn them into real trust
[1:41:35] trust has the little arrow action
[1:41:40] required that's right and when we really
[1:41:43] trust everything can shake down around
[1:41:46] us yes sir and we can stand and say
[1:41:49] God's got something better better God's
[1:41:52] got something better for me amen so now
[1:41:56] we look my brother and sister so we're
[1:41:59] not wrestling against flesh and blood
[1:42:00] very familiar scripture right we're
[1:42:02] we're dealing with darkness of this
[1:42:04] world so we take this armor and we're
[1:42:07] able then when we stand but we need to
[1:42:11] have our loins GED about with truth
[1:42:13] that's right amen if you take and my
[1:42:15] point I'm going to get to I'll just cut
[1:42:17] right to it if you take any one of these
[1:42:19] out of here it's not going to work you
[1:42:23] can have righteousness of the flesh
[1:42:26] without truth it won't work that's it
[1:42:29] and you can have truth without
[1:42:30] righteousness it won't work amen and if
[1:42:33] you don't have I hope you don't mind me
[1:42:35] being redundant here if you don't have
[1:42:38] your feet shawed with some
[1:42:42] preparation that doesn't say
[1:42:43] persperation that's right preparation
[1:42:47] what does that mean you've done
[1:42:48] something already that's it you've got
[1:42:50] your yourself ready for walking you've
[1:42:52] got yourself ready to go to battle
[1:42:54] you've got yourself ready to run into
[1:42:57] the presence of God whatever is
[1:43:00] presented to you you're ready
[1:43:03] amen amen Above All you have to have
[1:43:06] some Faith
[1:43:08] right cuz you see without
[1:43:12] faith you can't quench anything that's
[1:43:15] right
[1:43:18] amen amen takes faith that's right and
[1:43:22] when Faith starts to rise up in you you
[1:43:24] say but brother Paul I have a besetting
[1:43:27] sin well I tell you what you do with
[1:43:29] that besetting sin you get to the place
[1:43:32] when you recognize the symptom and the
[1:43:34] signal
[1:43:35] right I hope you know what I'm talking
[1:43:37] about it's
[1:43:38] true you recognize the S the signal
[1:43:42] that's sent out often times you want to
[1:43:44] you want to know what it is real cut and
[1:43:45] dry
[1:43:46] disappointment
[1:43:48] discouragement a little dose of of of
[1:43:52] um oh I don't know how do I want to say
[1:43:55] this I want to say it
[1:43:59] correctly you don't know what to say
[1:44:01] don't say it that's good
[1:44:05] amen can I say
[1:44:09] it none of us have it right because
[1:44:12] we're
[1:44:13] Christians but you just throw a little
[1:44:15] dose of depression in
[1:44:18] there God doesn't care any
[1:44:21] how nobody at church loves me my parents
[1:44:24] don't love me my children don't love me
[1:44:27] well pick anyone you want we don't have
[1:44:29] time enough to go through every
[1:44:31] alternative but you see what happens
[1:44:33] then see there where the fiery Dart
[1:44:36] comes the devil doesn't shoot you in the
[1:44:38] foot if it doesn't bother
[1:44:40] you he doesn't shoot you in the mind if
[1:44:43] it doesn't bother you but sometimes
[1:44:47] something right in the
[1:44:49] heart
[1:44:51] tears us
[1:44:53] up quench it that's it come on quench it
[1:44:58] that's it need a little faith amen Faith
[1:45:01] isn't just to take a Rapture with my
[1:45:03] brother and sister it's not just for
[1:45:05] healing it also quenches fiery darts
[1:45:08] amen faith will do that Hallelujah now
[1:45:11] as we look I I got to hurry on here you
[1:45:14] got to have the helmet on see every one
[1:45:16] of these is required you need the spirit
[1:45:18] you need the word amen praying prayer
[1:45:20] and supplication in the spirit yes sir
[1:45:23] amen now this just requires a comment or
[1:45:25] two I'm guiltier than guilty but my
[1:45:28] brother and sister if you pray like you
[1:45:31] talk to the operator on the
[1:45:35] phone Lord can you give me the
[1:45:39] address of Walmart on 12th
[1:45:44] Avenue what do you expect to
[1:45:49] get would y'all forgive me if I'm
[1:45:52] wrong that's one of the spots Satan has
[1:45:54] robbed us almost more than anywhere
[1:45:59] else our prayer life yes sir sounds
[1:46:04] like H I won't even go
[1:46:07] there you know what I'm talking about
[1:46:10] our prayer life sound like something
[1:46:11] that come back from the
[1:46:15] dead you
[1:46:16] know look I need to hurry move on
[1:46:21] I haven't claimed my 12 minutes
[1:46:24] yet so I I think you get the point I can
[1:46:27] move on so so I hope this not too
[1:46:30] personal since how I think it applies to
[1:46:33] most of
[1:46:34] us when we run from our problems have
[1:46:38] any of you ever done that
[1:46:40] before you know the parking lot was
[1:46:43] supposed to be the playground for the
[1:46:44] kids but you see all these little
[1:46:45] dimpled looks and you know I didn't know
[1:46:48] what those were for years until we went
[1:46:49] to austral and I realized that's where
[1:46:51] people have been putting their head in
[1:46:52] the
[1:46:53] sand and it leaves that little dimple
[1:46:56] there we got to see the ostriches do
[1:46:57] that you know isin't it amazing you guys
[1:46:59] ever watched ostrich do that they
[1:47:01] scratch a hole they literally put their
[1:47:04] head down there and kick sand on it now
[1:47:06] they do it for other reasons than people
[1:47:08] think you know they get flies and lice
[1:47:10] and those kind of things and that's how
[1:47:11] they're dealing with it I don't know
[1:47:13] what your reason would be but if your
[1:47:15] head is down in that sand you can't you
[1:47:18] can't see
[1:47:19] anything so my brother and sister you
[1:47:21] got to come to the place that you run
[1:47:24] from your problem can anybody tell me
[1:47:26] what happens when you run from your
[1:47:31] problem plus you also just run right
[1:47:33] into another
[1:47:36] one so it don't matter which direction
[1:47:39] of the compass compass you you you run
[1:47:41] from a problem you just run right into
[1:47:43] another way now you got
[1:47:45] two and people come and say my life's a
[1:47:47] total shambles why because they never
[1:47:49] dealt with problems years ago amen maybe
[1:47:53] the Lord moved upon them to repent on
[1:47:55] something and they pushed back and they
[1:47:56] just carried that with them you know
[1:47:58] I've used that analogy before in the
[1:48:00] airport somebody going through there and
[1:48:01] they got about 25 or 30 suitcases hooked
[1:48:04] together and they're dragging them
[1:48:05] through the airport and you think what
[1:48:06] are they doing well I tell you what
[1:48:09] they're just taking their baggage with
[1:48:10] them man we're not supposed to take our
[1:48:12] baggage we're supposed to do away with
[1:48:14] these things get it under the blood amen
[1:48:17] hallelujah so if we would run into the
[1:48:19] promise of the word for our hour as
[1:48:21] often as we ran away from it imagine
[1:48:23] what our lives would be imagine how
[1:48:26] spiritual our lives would be if we ran
[1:48:28] into the promise instead of from it amen
[1:48:31] amen but you know we step out of our
[1:48:34] fears and we step into a promise and our
[1:48:36] life starts to change
[1:48:40] immediately and when we've stepped into
[1:48:43] faith I want to ask you what's going to
[1:48:45] stand in your
[1:48:49] way when it's no longer your
[1:48:52] emotion no longer your reasoning right
[1:48:55] no longer your excuse of what God didn't
[1:48:58] do for you 20 years
[1:49:01] ago if you just stand there and say
[1:49:04] God's word is God's word and I believe
[1:49:05] it that's it and I accept it today as
[1:49:08] word just as valid today as it ever was
[1:49:11] amen nothing will stand in your way
[1:49:15] nothing okay I need to hurry
[1:49:19] along
[1:49:22] if the Holy Spirit if Jesus Christ
[1:49:24] proves he's here among us then press
[1:49:27] till you get to him amen
[1:49:30] amen right yeah that's exactly right
[1:49:33] believe he he's here in church today
[1:49:35] amen believe God's with us he's in our
[1:49:38] house he's in our life our car yes sir
[1:49:42] job whatever it
[1:49:46] is he proves he's here among us then
[1:49:48] press till you get to him like the
[1:49:50] little woman with the blood issue and
[1:49:51] all the different things that taken
[1:49:53] place and all the adversaries in her way
[1:49:56] she just pressed right on until she
[1:49:58] touched him now we know most of us
[1:50:01] wouldn't do that because our church
[1:50:03] clothes are too nice to crawl in the
[1:50:06] dirt and we're too
[1:50:08] respectable to push and shove and crawl
[1:50:12] between people's legs and keep going and
[1:50:16] we don't want a Hem of the Garment we
[1:50:17] want a handshake yeah
[1:50:22] how desperate are we that's
[1:50:25] it right I say we ought to be desperate
[1:50:28] enough as this quote says to do whatever
[1:50:31] it takes to get to Jesus
[1:50:35] Christ she pressed right on through till
[1:50:37] she touched him and if this church
[1:50:40] tonight I want to change that to today
[1:50:42] would do the same thing would press
[1:50:44] through every scale of unbelief would
[1:50:46] lock swords with the devil and his
[1:50:48] unbelief and press through to know that
[1:50:50] you're a child of God and an heir to
[1:50:53] these things and Jesus Christ standing
[1:50:55] present to show you that he's with you
[1:50:59] that's right first step right there you
[1:51:01] have to have confidence he's with you
[1:51:03] but brother Paul you don't know my life
[1:51:06] I don't care about your life it's under
[1:51:08] the
[1:51:09] blood yes sir that's it and he's
[1:51:12] standing present to show you that he's
[1:51:14] with you to keep his word be perseverant
[1:51:18] don't let nothing stand in your way can
[1:51:20] I say that out loud don't let nothing
[1:51:24] stand in your
[1:51:26] way
[1:51:31] amen you
[1:51:32] know I don't want to go into too much
[1:51:36] detail but by God's grace I have been in
[1:51:41] conversation just very blunt I think
[1:51:44] I'll just say it out
[1:51:46] loud a man left his wife and
[1:51:48] children
[1:51:50] got caught up in alcohol got caught up
[1:51:53] in drugs ended
[1:51:55] up in a homosexual
[1:51:59] relationship and couldn't even tell you
[1:52:01] how it happened that's the scary thing
[1:52:03] right it wasn't like well I felt
[1:52:05] attracted to this guy he said when I
[1:52:07] come to myself I felt
[1:52:10] just
[1:52:14] revolted but he would do drugs he would
[1:52:17] do alcohol find himself in another
[1:52:19] relationship
[1:52:23] this man's brother come to me and said
[1:52:27] brother Paul you will you have a
[1:52:29] conversation with my
[1:52:31] brother of course I
[1:52:34] would we had a conversation and he said
[1:52:37] I've made such a mess of my
[1:52:39] life I've made such a mess of my life I
[1:52:42] I I I've got away from that spirit that
[1:52:45] Spirit got broke and I'm no longer
[1:52:46] attracted to that and and I quit
[1:52:48] drinking and when I qu quit drinking and
[1:52:51] then all of the little peripheral not
[1:52:53] hardcore but peripheral drug stuff just
[1:52:55] all faded away but look at the wreck of
[1:52:59] my
[1:53:01] life well Paul being so spiritual I just
[1:53:04] well like let me give you some advice
[1:53:06] sir no sir when they were kind of
[1:53:09] looking the other way him and his
[1:53:10] brother I was like oh
[1:53:13] Lord what do I say to this
[1:53:16] man I was shaking my shoes and I'm not
[1:53:18] kidding I literally was sitting there so
[1:53:20] nervous my foot's bouncing up if Jerry
[1:53:22] had been there she'd have said there's
[1:53:23] something wrong with my husband he's
[1:53:24] having a meltdown I'm just sitting there
[1:53:26] oh I it's just an adrenaline rush Paul
[1:53:29] there's no Lions there's no Tigers
[1:53:30] there's no reason to have adrenaline
[1:53:32] this is
[1:53:34] fear and then something said tell him
[1:53:38] that's it if he will go and humble
[1:53:42] himself that's it before me that's it I
[1:53:47] will make the way before him amen right
[1:53:50] that's right I was like brother that's
[1:53:53] that boldness come I felt like a
[1:53:55] different man draw the
[1:53:58] sword brother you need to repent amen
[1:54:01] from the depths of your heart and he
[1:54:03] just slid out of his chair right there
[1:54:04] and started crying out to God and when
[1:54:07] he got done repenting I said God will
[1:54:09] take you back speak to your wife and say
[1:54:12] honey I still love you and I want to be
[1:54:16] married to you and I ask you forg
[1:54:22] me and his wife I wasn't there his wife
[1:54:27] got down in her knees wrapped her arms
[1:54:29] around him I have the same thing to
[1:54:32] confess to you
[1:54:35] amen and their
[1:54:37] children are growing up in the house of
[1:54:39] God about that big about
[1:54:42] now and they are
[1:54:44] happy what can wash that's it away my my
[1:54:52] sin nothing that's it nothing amen but
[1:54:56] the blood of Jesus brother Alex will you

[1:55:06] white amen was wher that's
[1:55:12] it you see you got to see yourself

[1:55:18] it than washed white amen hallelujah and
[1:55:22] when I'm washed white he makes me whole
[1:55:25] it amen now that's not the way the song
[1:55:27] goes but that's how the program worked
[1:55:29] that's it amen amen that's right you got
[1:55:31] to be washed before you can be whole
[1:55:33] that's right amen hallelujah amen well I
[1:55:37] kept you a little long if you forgive me

[1:55:58] just give you a hint you know we get so
[1:56:01] offended so easy Can someone say
[1:56:06] [Music]
[1:56:07] Amen road to emus those two brothers are
[1:56:10] walking down that road man we sure
[1:56:13] thought he Jesus was going to be the
[1:56:16] savior of Israel we sure thought this we
[1:56:18] thought that we thought that now how
[1:56:20] about you're walking on your road and
[1:56:23] the Lord Jesus would come to you and ask
[1:56:26] you hey what's going on and you start
[1:56:28] telling them well this Jesus of Nazareth
[1:56:30] we
[1:56:31] [Music]
[1:56:33] thought and I'm going to turn the
[1:56:36] context just a little bit the preacher
[1:56:38] looks you in the face and
[1:56:41] says
[1:56:43] H oh my
[1:56:46] goodness I'm being just

[1:56:56] heart man this ain't my
[1:57:00] [Music]

[1:57:04] messengers and Prophets of the Ages come
[1:57:06] and stood in the midst of the church in
[1:57:08] this
[1:57:09] day you think we could handle
[1:57:12] it I think they'd tear the height off of
[1:57:15] us I think we'd hear about the same
[1:57:18] words
[1:57:20] foolish and slow of heart to
[1:57:23] believe there I got it out I I felt
[1:57:25] checked like I'm going to just be too
[1:57:28] bold but I think my brother and sister
[1:57:30] it's about time for us to quit acting
[1:57:32] like fools and it's about time for us to
[1:57:35] quit letting our heart with all the
[1:57:37] fiery
[1:57:39] darts quit trying to quench them
[1:57:41] yourself let Faith quench it amen
[1:57:45] hallelujah sorry Satan that one's under

[1:58:12] which I have now come to realize I am a
[1:58:18] hoarder

[1:58:23] bolts and
[1:58:24] nails and old
[1:58:26] Hammers and do
[1:58:30] saws what if we're hoarding all kinds
[1:58:35] of things of the past

[1:58:42] emotions my experience from way back
[1:58:46] when the
[1:58:48] gospel
[1:58:50] was totally incomprehensible to
[1:58:54] us no
[1:58:57] Revelation and somebody come and
[1:58:59] preached and said if you don't do this
[1:59:00] you're going to hell and all we got out

[1:59:04] to
