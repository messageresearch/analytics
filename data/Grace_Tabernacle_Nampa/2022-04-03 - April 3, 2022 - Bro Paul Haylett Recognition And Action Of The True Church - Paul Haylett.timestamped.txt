[29:21] o'clock of course regular service
[29:23] sunday morning and then at five o'clock
[29:25] we'll be having communion
[29:27] good to have everyone here for that
[29:30] amen brother chris if you'd come
[29:40] like i'm doing this a lot lately
[29:43] but at that time of year things are
[29:46] things are happening so it's exciting um
[29:49] so a few announcements um first there's
[29:52] a youth meeting this friday at 7 pm at
[29:54] our house and then grace kids
[29:56] i'm assuming at uh for the surgeon
[29:59] sister julius
[30:00] so seven o'clock at our house
[30:03] um
[30:04] and they want to pull the picture up
[30:06] here we went
[30:08] my family and i went out yesterday to
[30:10] look at the campground
[30:12] this is just the only picture i really
[30:14] have of the
[30:16] pavilion where we'll be holding services
[30:20] it was very nice facility good
[30:22] atmosphere i know it seems like a little
[30:23] thing but when we pulled in there was a
[30:25] cross right there on the back of this
[30:27] and so just very
[30:29] um
[30:30] comfortable for a church camp they have
[30:32] lots of church functions there um that's
[30:35] always nice to have
[30:37] and it's a nice atmosphere it's very
[30:39] beautiful hasn't
[30:41] budded yet right like the rest of of
[30:43] things
[30:43] but you can
[30:45] it's it's a gorgeous location there's
[30:47] plenty of room for everybody
[30:49] we have enough spots for everybody's
[30:51] trailer
[30:53] and we have room for one more guest
[30:55] trailer so there's a couple of people on
[30:57] our but the terry t catch was mentioning
[30:59] coming down
[31:01] whether jose maybe
[31:02] so we're going to send out the form um
[31:05] either later today or tomorrow a couple
[31:07] of things i needed to finalize on that
[31:09] and if you had someone who asked express
[31:12] the desire to come if you could send
[31:13] that to them
[31:15] everyone filled that out by may 31st
[31:18] so but there's plenty of room for tents
[31:21] and if there's if we're fully booked up
[31:23] um
[31:25] i think we can have room for an
[31:27] additional four
[31:28] three or four tenths
[31:30] if
[31:31] people still want to come and enjoy
[31:33] um things during the day and the
[31:36] services and things there's
[31:38] lodging nearby in idaho city
[31:41] it's close but the roads kind of windy
[31:44] so it doesn't feel as close but it is
[31:46] close enough to
[31:47] drive there and back
[31:49] but that is not an invitation for any of
[31:52] you to do that
[31:55] if you belong to grace tabernacle you
[31:57] stay in the campground
[32:02] so
[32:05] just making sure i got everything
[32:06] there's hiking trails right off the camp
[32:09] there's some steps that go out of the
[32:10] campground
[32:11] and access to the public land so we'll
[32:13] probably
[32:15] attentively do a hike on the saturday
[32:18] so we're looking forward to that that's
[32:19] in july um 14th through the 17th we'll
[32:22] send out the form have that filled out
[32:24] anybody who wants to come send it to
[32:26] them
[32:28] we need to to know ahead of time so
[32:31] the other thing is tomorrow our
[32:34] registration for the health camp uh
[32:36] median life fellowship camp opens at one
[32:38] o'clock so tomorrow registration for the
[32:41] camp in june opens at 1pm
[32:44] last year
[32:45] um it opened at one o'clock by 1 15 or
[32:48] later or earlier it was overbooked by
[32:52] six six or so people so
[32:55] i most of you probably remember everyone
[32:57] was ready to go before one o'clock we're
[33:00] hitting the refresh button
[33:02] and as soon as it opened filled out the
[33:04] form so
[33:05] if you plan to go
[33:07] you need to be online we'll send the
[33:09] link on the youth chat you need to be
[33:11] online
[33:12] by
[33:13] 1250 right i mean
[33:16] ready to go make sure you hit the
[33:18] refresh button because if it's not
[33:22] wired a certain way won't refresh for
[33:23] you it'll open and you'll sit in there
[33:25] staring at it closed until you refresh
[33:27] it then you could could possibly miss it
[33:28] so at 12 50 get on there
[33:31] and be ready to
[33:33] sign up because it's going to go fast it
[33:35] went fast last year you think oh well
[33:37] this year covid's been gone
[33:39] but everybody's remembering how fast it
[33:42] went last year so it's just going to
[33:43] keep doing that every year
[33:45] it's a popular uh camp
[33:48] with the low amount of allowed campers
[33:51] so tomorrow one o'clock it opens up the
[33:54] fee is around two hundred dollars
[33:58] and we'll be flying the group
[34:01] down
[34:02] there we're not going to drive this year
[34:03] we're going to fly
[34:07] the lord will watch out for
[34:09] for all of us flying is safer than
[34:12] driving actually
[34:14] it's june 1st through the 6th that's the
[34:16] dates for the trip the campus starts the
[34:19] second and goes through
[34:21] the sixth
[34:23] so we'll come down one day earlier and
[34:26] fly out the sixth which is wednesday
[34:28] through monday
[34:30] tickets are around three hundred dollars
[34:32] give or take depending
[34:36] so keep an eye on that because
[34:39] with the way the world is right now
[34:40] they're getting expensive fast
[34:42] so
[34:44] i talked with our pastor if you need
[34:46] assistance
[34:47] if you need assistance
[34:49] it's not like you'd rather buy a new
[34:52] exhaust for your bike or that 150 louis
[34:55] vuitton purse
[34:57] it's a need
[34:59] we want to know either talk to me or our
[35:01] pastor
[35:02] um because if you there's no way for you
[35:05] to go we want to help you go because we
[35:07] think it's important
[35:08] to go um so there's a situation where
[35:10] you can't make it you know talk to
[35:12] either me or or a pastor
[35:15] so tomorrow
[35:16] the most important thing for you to
[35:18] remember right now
[35:19] is tomorrow at one o'clock
[35:22] is a camp registration so i'm gonna say
[35:24] i'm gonna stop saying one o'clock
[35:25] tomorrow at 12 50 p.m
[35:27] is the camp registration you will have
[35:29] to pay
[35:30] when you sign up so it's around two
[35:32] hundred dollars give or take so if you
[35:33] need assistance if you need assistance
[35:36] underlying bold
[35:38] talk to us so that's all i have looking
[35:41] forward to what we have coming up
[35:43] this year and praying that the lord will
[35:45] just bless everything lord bless you
[35:50] amen
[35:52] as brother paul comes let's sing number
[35:55] 888
[35:59] i keep listening for a different sound
[36:02] [Music]

[36:07] see famine in the land
[36:10] there's questions in the children's eyes
[36:14] trouble in the east again

[36:21] there's no sure place to stand
[36:24] and mournful sounds are heard throughout
[36:28] the land
[36:32] but i
[36:33] keep listening for a different sound
[36:39] the sound of the city that

[37:18] that will be the last i can't believe
[37:22] i'm standing here
[37:24] seeing the end of time
[37:27] and the preacher's voice still echoing
[37:30] in my mind
[37:32] [Music]
[37:36] listening for a different sound
[37:41] sound on the city that
[37:44] john saw coming down
[37:47] the sound on the bride being united with
[37:52] the groom
[37:54] i
[37:55] keep listening
[37:58] i
[37:58] keep listening

[38:02] keep listening for a different sound
[38:06] scene again
[38:08] well

[38:16] sound of the city that

[38:22] the sound on the bride being united with
[38:26] the groom
[38:28] but i

[38:36] keep listening for a different
[38:40] sound
[38:43] can we say amen to that this morning
[38:45] amen
[38:47] lots of voices in the land
[38:49] but by god's grace
[38:51] our ear has been turned to his voice he
[38:54] says my sheep
[38:55] hear my voice and just thankful today
[38:58] that we can stand and say thank you lord
[39:01] that my ear has been tuned to your voice
[39:04] amen
[39:05] hallelujah well i just want to reiterate
[39:08] what brother chris had said to our young
[39:10] people
[39:12] we want to see you go to camp
[39:15] we're not trying to dictate a camp to
[39:17] you but i believe it's good
[39:20] uh i can look back in my own youth
[39:23] and uh you know there comes a time if
[39:25] we're not careful we feel very
[39:26] disconnected like
[39:28] well we're just this little nothing's
[39:31] here and
[39:32] you know don't feel like we belong like
[39:34] we fit in and we don't the lord never
[39:36] intended for us to fit into this world
[39:39] and uh but there is a whole group of
[39:43] youth
[39:44] around this world
[39:46] that are serving god with their whole
[39:48] heart mind body and soul
[39:51] and um it is our desire not only for you
[39:54] to hear the preaching of the word and
[39:56] take place with that but to have a
[39:58] connection
[39:59] with the body of believers to realize
[40:01] that there are young people that have
[40:03] been called of the lord just like you
[40:04] have been
[40:05] that god has a desire for you to build
[40:08] these friendships to to have these peers
[40:12] my brother and sister and young people
[40:14] please hear me
[40:15] if you view the world out here as your
[40:18] peer
[40:20] you will be sadly disappointed
[40:22] because they're anointed by an entirely
[40:25] different anointing
[40:27] our peers whether we're young or old
[40:30] are sons and daughters of god the bride
[40:32] of christ is our peers amen
[40:35] hallelujah
[40:36] well i just want to uh just
[40:40] come this morning i trust that i can
[40:42] preach this it's quite lengthy i one
[40:45] short scripture and just hours of quotes
[40:49] but um you know it's just um you know
[40:52] things that been stirring my heart i i
[40:55] confess to you and and i i hope you can
[40:57] see the humor in it i went around the
[40:59] house
[41:00] and collected up all the books that i've
[41:02] got one by this chair one by that chair
[41:04] one in the library one in the bedroom
[41:07] and i collected them all up and i put
[41:09] them away in the library
[41:11] and i'm just trying to now
[41:14] if i want to sit down in the easy chair
[41:16] i go find the book that i'm reading and
[41:18] take it back to the easy chair with me
[41:21] and having done that i can actually now
[41:24] say wow
[41:25] my sermon was based
[41:27] the real thought the heart of it come
[41:29] from one sermon
[41:31] amen and
[41:33] one message amen broke up in many parts
[41:36] but one message
[41:38] anyway thank you so much brother jason
[41:40] once again i just have to say not to
[41:42] lift my brother jason up but the songs
[41:44] that lord laid upon his heart
[41:47] today once again
[41:49] uh are in continuity with just the very
[41:52] things that we've been looking at
[41:55] i just want to speak to you this morning
[41:56] once again over the overall topic of the
[41:58] two sides of obedience
[42:00] and i want to speak to you on
[42:02] recognition and action of the true
[42:05] church and if we'll just stand and turn
[42:06] in our bibles to the book of acts the
[42:09] first chapter verses one through eight
[42:12] and uh so in this we will
[42:14] uh take our our thought today and tying
[42:17] it directly back
[42:19] to uh the message that i had been
[42:22] reading and studying out of
[42:24] and um
[42:26] just believe it's very
[42:28] beautiful acts 1 1
[42:31] the former treaties have i made o
[42:33] theophilus of all that jesus began both
[42:37] to do
[42:38] and teach
[42:40] i'm going to
[42:41] make a whole
[42:43] list
[42:44] i'm going to bring a whole discourse to
[42:47] you
[42:48] of the things that jesus began both to
[42:51] do
[42:52] and to teach
[42:54] now we want to take this
[42:56] out of this the reason the word began is
[43:00] there luke didn't use this by accident
[43:02] you see this
[43:05] teaching
[43:06] and this doing
[43:09] have never ended
[43:11] so if we would think okay jesus ministry
[43:14] was finished you hear phrases and i i
[43:17] give the benefit that is verbiage
[43:20] but you see people say well you know
[43:22] jesus ministry
[43:24] ended i'm sorry
[43:27] his ministry will never end
[43:30] amen it's eternal
[43:33] and there is a part of this
[43:36] that i i want to focus today to bring to
[43:38] you that it's fine that we have the
[43:42] teaching
[43:44] but we have to have the doing also
[43:47] so if we just have teaching but no doing
[43:50] we become theologians
[43:52] we become we become educated
[43:55] but by the opening of the word
[43:59] and it's striking the heart
[44:02] the true seed something has to happen
[44:05] amen
[44:09] until the day in which he was taken up
[44:11] after that he through the holy ghost has
[44:14] given commandments unto the apostles
[44:17] whom he had chosen now i want to and
[44:20] then we'll just go on and read the
[44:21] scripture in its entirety i want you to
[44:22] remember as we go on now in the book of
[44:24] acts here you'll see that as they go to
[44:28] choose a replacement for judas
[44:32] man's choosing
[44:35] never yielded anything for the kingdom
[44:38] bethes was a good man he would be our
[44:40] brother he would be but you see he was
[44:42] chosen of man and the scripture says
[44:45] here see the apostles whom jesus had
[44:48] chosen
[44:49] so there's a difference between the
[44:51] choosing of a man
[44:53] and god choosing the man
[44:55] and i just wanted to make that point
[44:57] amen certainly nothing against him
[45:01] he was faithful he desired to serve but
[45:03] we definitely want the lord to be in
[45:06] control amen
[45:11] tomb also he showed himself alive
[45:14] after his passion by many infallible
[45:16] proofs being seen of them forty days and
[45:19] speaking of the things pertaining to the
[45:22] kingdom of god
[45:23] and being assembled together with them
[45:25] commanded them that they should not
[45:27] depart from jerusalem
[45:29] but wait for the promise of the father
[45:32] which saith he ye have heard of me
[45:35] for john truly baptized with water but
[45:38] ye shall be baptized with the holy ghost
[45:41] not many days hence
[45:44] and i love that right there because you
[45:46] see he's giving them a timeline of
[45:49] expectancy
[45:51] he didn't say someday this will happen
[45:54] but wait he did say someday this will
[45:56] happen but he told them it's it's going
[45:58] to happen soon
[46:01] but remember this is the mind of god
[46:03] speaking amen
[46:05] and in this case it did happen soon but
[46:08] the word says that he's coming for you
[46:10] and i quickly
[46:11] yes sir
[46:13] and yet we see the years pass by and
[46:15] many people say well brother brown said
[46:16] this and it didn't happen
[46:18] well for every quote that you can say
[46:20] brother branham said he believed it
[46:21] would happen within the year or within
[46:23] this time frame we forget to mention the
[46:26] one where he said it might be 100 years
[46:31] so our urgency my brother and sister is
[46:33] not an urgency that's
[46:35] lost
[46:36] by the passing of time
[46:38] but it's an urgency
[46:40] as we see the passing of time
[46:44] does that make sense
[46:47] so the
[46:48] closer as we see the day of proaching
[46:50] there's an urgency
[46:52] amen
[46:58] and being assembled together with them
[47:00] commanded them that they should not
[47:01] depart from jerusalem but wait for the
[47:03] promise of the father which saith he you
[47:05] have heard of me for john truly baptized
[47:08] with water but ye shall be baptized with
[47:10] the holy ghost not many days hence
[47:12] when they therefore were come together
[47:14] they ask of him saying lord will thou at
[47:17] this time restore again the kingdom of
[47:19] israel and he said unto them it is not
[47:21] for you to know the times or the seasons
[47:24] which the father hath put in his have
[47:27] put in his own uh power but ye shall
[47:30] receive power
[47:32] after that the holy ghost has come upon
[47:35] you
[47:36] and ye shall be witnesses unto me
[47:38] both in jerusalem in all of judea and
[47:40] samaria and to the outermost part of the
[47:43] earth
[47:44] emily father we just ask for your
[47:46] blessings on the word today father we
[47:48] thank you for your grace lord your
[47:51] unending father
[47:54] eternal grace
[47:55] lord that you so freely give to us
[47:57] father
[47:59] it humbles our hearts lord to realize
[48:01] that
[48:02] lord in the very creation of flesh you
[48:04] knew the element that
[48:06] father we needed
[48:09] you place that element within us
[48:12] lord you give us an ability
[48:14] oh father i thank you lord as i studied
[48:16] this thought the inspiration it gave to
[48:19] my own heart my own soul
[48:21] and we just say thank you today father
[48:24] for the ability
[48:26] we love you i ask you to bless your word
[48:28] today in the name of jesus christ amen
[48:31] god bless you and of course as the body
[48:33] of believers there is
[48:35] no visitors and so we always just come
[48:38] together as a part of the body of christ
[48:41] amen
[48:42] you know sometimes as we look in the
[48:44] word power as it is in verse 8 here he
[48:47] says but ye shall receive power
[48:49] and you know sometimes i think we really
[48:51] misunderstand what god was laying out
[48:53] there and you know some believe and and
[48:56] i'm just going to speak just for a
[48:58] moment as it were vaguely out of the
[49:00] history of my own life some believe that
[49:02] the power that was given was all placed
[49:05] into the ministry and everyone else was
[49:08] subservient to that but the prophet of
[49:10] god did not teach that and the word of
[49:12] god does not teach that there's only one
[49:14] power that we become subservient to and
[49:17] that is jesus christ himself amen the
[49:20] holy ghost we yield ourselves to that so
[49:23] as we uh would look at this it is not a
[49:26] power my brother and sister to boss
[49:28] everyone around it's not a power for the
[49:30] preacher to boss the church around it's
[49:33] not even a power given for us to tell
[49:36] the devil what to do
[49:39] now i want you to think about that some
[49:41] people boldly i told the devil
[49:44] well my brother and sister if the
[49:45] verbiage is correct well i i don't
[49:48] criticize the words but you see my
[49:50] brother and sister it's not in us to
[49:53] have the ability to tell the devil what
[49:55] to do if you need a scriptural example
[49:58] example we look at the seven sons of
[50:00] siva who looked out and said well we
[50:03] just saw what they have done they have
[50:04] spoke to these demons so spoke to these
[50:07] servants they uh
[50:08] uh demons the servants of the devil and
[50:11] and we're going to just bind them like
[50:13] that now it would have been embarrassing
[50:15] to come running back out the door with
[50:17] your clothes tore off and scratches and
[50:19] no doubt maybe even bites or whatever it
[50:21] would be all over you terrified my
[50:24] brother and sister proving that manning
[50:26] himself is no match for the devil but
[50:28] it's there that when we come sometimes
[50:30] in the religious realm people say well
[50:32] because i'm a christian i can tell the
[50:34] devil what to do but let's look what
[50:36] brother branham says here just in a
[50:38] glimpse out of awakening jesus he said
[50:40] that life that's within us is not only a
[50:43] creative life but it's part of his own
[50:47] life that's the reason we have the
[50:49] authority to speak to a devil because
[50:52] it's god's own creative life if
[50:56] you're anointed
[50:58] you so it's not even for us just to say
[51:00] because god sent a prophet and i can
[51:02] read this quote i'm going to tell the
[51:04] devil what to do now because the life is
[51:07] in us this creative life when you speak
[51:11] it's not you speaking but it is your
[51:14] father that is in you that is speaking
[51:17] and so it's there we have to have the
[51:19] right approach to see brother branham
[51:21] tempered this with saying if you're
[51:23] anointed so a man could be reading this
[51:25] quote and say i'm going to speak to the
[51:28] devil i'm going to deal with this i'm
[51:30] going to do this but if he doesn't have
[51:32] the holy ghost it's still a man speaking
[51:36] but if we've got the holy ghost my
[51:38] brother and sister we don't have to sit
[51:40] back and watch the devil kick the
[51:42] windows out of our house we can stand
[51:44] firmly upon the word and we can speak
[51:47] those things and bind the devil in the
[51:49] name of jesus christ so our real goal
[51:52] ultimately i guess you would say is that
[51:55] we live
[51:57] in the presence of god
[52:00] but
[52:00] we see the priests
[52:02] lived in the presence of god and god had
[52:04] to choose samuel
[52:06] to speak to them
[52:08] so it's not even just living in the
[52:10] presence
[52:11] but it's being filled
[52:13] with the presence of god
[52:15] it's having christ in the position of
[52:19] headship
[52:22] amen
[52:24] we have these jokes and i i kind of
[52:26] laugh at them they're kind of getting
[52:28] old when people talk about well my
[52:30] husband might be my head but i'm the
[52:32] neck that turns it well my brother and
[52:34] sister that's that might make good
[52:36] family humor but in the end of the day
[52:38] there ought to be one where the wife is
[52:40] praying that the only thing that can
[52:42] turn the husband's head is the holy
[52:44] ghost
[52:47] not the spirits of the age
[52:49] not the whim or will
[52:51] now i'm not anybody that's ever spoken
[52:53] that i'm not criticizing you i'm just
[52:55] making a point
[52:57] you see it's not us we can't do that the
[52:59] devil's not the least bit afraid of you
[53:02] but it is this life that is in you
[53:05] and this is why it's so important that
[53:07] we grasp in the godhead that it is not
[53:10] only christ above us and with us he has
[53:14] to be in us
[53:17] and so without that portion we could and
[53:20] i i don't mean to be negative but we can
[53:22] go to a message church we can confess
[53:25] the message is true we can be baptized
[53:27] we can do all of these things without
[53:30] that coming to fruition we will be as
[53:32] powerful as any other person but when we
[53:36] get everything in the right order
[53:38] according to the teaching of the word
[53:41] amen then we can come as we've been
[53:44] speaking on wednesdays look when jesus
[53:46] was there and he was with all the
[53:48] priests and everything and joseph and
[53:50] mary come and mary speaks and says oh
[53:52] your father and i well my brother and
[53:54] sister you see jesus couldn't have said
[53:57] i don't want to embarrass my mama i
[53:58] don't want to leave anything confusing
[54:00] out here as it were and do this and so
[54:04] i'll just ignore it but no my brother
[54:06] and sister the holy ghost will not uh
[54:08] ignore the air and that's why any
[54:11] minister that's worth his salt wheel
[54:13] we'll look at this a little bit any
[54:15] minister worth his toll would rather
[54:17] have you angry at him now than you angry
[54:21] at him on the day of judgment
[54:24] he'd rather take the flock as it were
[54:27] now that you don't like what he's
[54:28] preaching because you see the true word
[54:31] can't ignore the air
[54:33] nor do we want it to
[54:35] you know there's nothing more
[54:37] frustrating
[54:38] than to be working on a piece of
[54:40] equipment
[54:42] and you know it's easy to tear things
[54:43] apart
[54:44] you know it's easy to tear up at church
[54:47] do you know it takes quite a bit of
[54:48] effort to build up a church
[54:51] real easy to criticize and talk about
[54:53] how you're not believers and you're not
[54:56] applying yourself and you're not this
[54:58] but what does it take then to take and
[55:00] this this assembly let's just speak to
[55:02] ourselves and build this up to where you
[55:05] know hey uh i don't know
[55:08] i mean
[55:09] not you but people like you
[55:11] got upset yesterday
[55:17] that's good emphasis bro brother trevor
[55:24] but you see it's not about getting upset
[55:25] it's about what we did after we got
[55:27] upset
[55:29] and so god's given us the answer to our
[55:31] question to the sin question we have the
[55:34] answer we don't have to say i hope to
[55:36] find this answer we have the answer
[55:39] amen so by god's grace we can move
[55:41] forward and be strengthened so you see
[55:44] this life that's within us is not only
[55:47] creative life and that's what i want
[55:49] grace tabernacle to be i want the
[55:51] atmosphere of the holy ghost in this
[55:53] assembly to be a creative life to create
[55:57] an atmosphere our young people want to
[55:59] serve god because they know he's real oh
[56:01] mom and dad they're not perfect i saw
[56:03] them arguing but
[56:06] look a little closer
[56:09] you'll see god correct mom and dad
[56:12] you'll see god correct the preacher
[56:14] you'll see god take control of these
[56:16] things if we'll look a little closer
[56:21] but to catch the atmosphere
[56:24] and our young people realize that this
[56:26] life that's in them is a creative life
[56:28] and they want to express themselves they
[56:30] want to be who i was called to be
[56:33] you know the marine corps used to say be
[56:35] all you can be
[56:38] and i remember some cynical people
[56:41] years ago bought a billboard back in the
[56:43] midwest somewhere and it had part half
[56:45] of it was the marine corps be all the
[56:46] you can be and on the other side be the
[56:48] best cannon fodder you can be
[56:51] they were anti-war
[56:54] but you see as sons and daughters of god
[56:56] we are not cannon fodder for the devil
[56:59] when we get christ on the inside we have
[57:03] every right to take every redemptive
[57:07] promise of god and apply it to our life
[57:10] and move forward with confidence
[57:13] the devil's the one that wants to get
[57:15] you to use a little pitchfork religion
[57:17] we always talk about pitchfork religion
[57:19] being well okay there's somebody in this
[57:21] church this and that and we're like oh i
[57:23] think that belongs to them
[57:24] i think it belongs to them but you see
[57:27] god wants us to use a little pitchfork
[57:29] religion amen hallelujah lord just keep
[57:31] shoveling it in here keep throwing it in
[57:34] here lord because this is the very life
[57:37] that is giving us life
[57:40] hallelujah the very creative life amen
[57:44] hallelujah once again a reminder it's
[57:46] not us
[57:48] but it's him in us
[57:49] amen now what is this power that he's
[57:52] talking about
[57:54] in context here the definition many
[57:57] definitions for power
[57:59] but i love this one the best the ability
[58:01] to do
[58:03] or to act in a certain way now let's go
[58:06] right back and read that scripture again
[58:08] amen because i want you to to catch this
[58:11] this morning if i can but ye shall
[58:14] receive the ability
[58:17] [Music]
[58:20] come on saints
[58:23] to do
[58:25] and act
[58:26] in a certain way
[58:29] you can just give a bible my brother and
[58:31] sister i just come across the deal and
[58:33] i'm not faulting it i believe in giving
[58:34] out bibles um
[58:36] and and doing these things but see
[58:38] there's like you know
[58:40] we need you know a thousand bibles for a
[58:43] certain place
[58:44] what we need is the holy ghost to anoint
[58:46] that word because there's millions of
[58:48] people reading their bible and it's not
[58:50] changed them at all
[58:52] but there's life contained in the word
[58:54] of god that is life-changing and so as
[58:57] we'll look at this but ye shall receive
[59:00] power or the ability to do the word the
[59:04] ability to act in a certain way and my
[59:07] brother and sister you know one of the
[59:08] signs of a cult is conformity
[59:13] you know why that's why they want to
[59:15] call you a cult that's right because
[59:17] they look at you and see conformity
[59:20] but they think that conformity is coming
[59:22] through a man-made leadership that's
[59:24] coming down causing you
[59:27] to dress walk and talk a certain way
[59:30] but they've missed the leadership
[59:32] of the holy ghost
[59:33] that's the thing they have totally
[59:35] totally missed is the leadership of the
[59:37] holy ghost because we cannot be
[59:40] non-conformist and say that this word is
[59:42] important to us
[59:44] god expects us to live the word to align
[59:47] to the word to receive the revelation of
[59:50] this word and so in that realm my
[59:52] brother and sister the devil's always
[59:54] the one right stood up called jesus
[59:56] beals above a devil
[59:58] telling the religious world that this
[1:00:01] revealed word is of the devil
[1:00:05] it's almost
[1:00:07] ironic
[1:00:09] maybe even could go to the far those of
[1:00:11] you have warped humor
[1:00:14] to say that's humorous
[1:00:16] a devil
[1:00:18] so
[1:00:19] in the tradition of man
[1:00:23] that man relates to it
[1:00:25] yes sir
[1:00:27] a devil saying this word
[1:00:30] that is trying to change your life is
[1:00:32] going against
[1:00:34] our tradition
[1:00:36] and the people said whoa we have
[1:00:39] tradition
[1:00:43] and they rejected the cornerstone
[1:00:46] because
[1:00:48] their hearts were smitten in them
[1:00:51] and those who were not studied in the
[1:00:54] word of god
[1:00:55] were deluded
[1:00:57] they were drawn away they were deceived
[1:01:00] because they had no foundation in the
[1:01:02] word
[1:01:05] it's pretty funny how the devil can come
[1:01:07] right back use that same pattern
[1:01:09] millions of people have a bible and he's
[1:01:12] using the same exact pattern that he
[1:01:14] used with jesus once again and saying
[1:01:16] this is of the devil this is of the
[1:01:18] devil this is of the devil and the
[1:01:20] people by their tradition are looking at
[1:01:22] all they know look this is my
[1:01:24] grandfather just come across the deal in
[1:01:27] my readings the other day this is back
[1:01:29] in the midwest
[1:01:30] and uh these these people
[1:01:32] they were it was like a little uh
[1:01:35] oh i don't know how would you call a
[1:01:36] little bio of a farm family that's been
[1:01:39] farming in the midwest forever and ever
[1:01:41] and and
[1:01:42] this church i won't name the name of the
[1:01:44] church but this church my
[1:01:45] great-grandfather
[1:01:47] helped establish this church
[1:01:51] and every one of our family
[1:01:53] has always gone
[1:01:55] to this church
[1:02:00] praise the lord
[1:02:02] tradition
[1:02:04] had nothing to do with the preaching of
[1:02:06] the word
[1:02:08] in fact that particular farmer
[1:02:11] i thought it was funny because you get a
[1:02:13] read between the lines that particular
[1:02:14] farmer was actually the interim pastor
[1:02:17] of that church because the previous
[1:02:19] pastor had taught things that they
[1:02:21] disagreed with
[1:02:22] same denomination but things he
[1:02:24] disagreed with so they got rid of him
[1:02:26] and now this man just steps in because
[1:02:27] he's got to carry on
[1:02:29] the tradition
[1:02:32] and if you go against our tradition we
[1:02:34] got to go against you
[1:02:36] and that's exactly what happened
[1:02:38] in the days when jesus was on the earth
[1:02:40] and it's exactly what is happening in
[1:02:42] the day that we're living in
[1:02:44] you see my brother and sister what was
[1:02:46] absent and i don't say this judgmental
[1:02:48] but what was absent was the power
[1:02:50] because the power is there to give you
[1:02:53] the ability to do the word and act in a
[1:02:56] certain way which would be the way that
[1:02:58] the word would cause you to act the life
[1:03:01] that the word brought to you is what god
[1:03:03] wants you to live out amen so we've been
[1:03:06] given an ability to be sons and
[1:03:08] daughters of god can we say amen to that
[1:03:10] we've been given the ability to trust
[1:03:12] the word as unerring we've been given
[1:03:14] the ability to act in a certain way in
[1:03:16] other words to come and to actively seek
[1:03:19] the holy ghost in a life-changing
[1:03:22] experience you've been given that
[1:03:24] ability to lay a hold on that right to
[1:03:26] lay hold on eternal life you've been
[1:03:28] given that ability it is not something
[1:03:30] that the whole world has been given amen
[1:03:33] but you know we can have ability
[1:03:36] without having action
[1:03:40] and so if we have an ability that's been
[1:03:42] given to us and we don't use it for what
[1:03:45] it was meant for
[1:03:47] and now because i don't you know have
[1:03:49] any other example i
[1:03:51] i i would use myself in this case and
[1:03:54] quite a few years ago there was all
[1:03:56] kinds of activity going on at the county
[1:03:59] level concerning what they were going to
[1:04:01] do and allow to be done with farmland
[1:04:03] and i kind of got involved with that it
[1:04:05] had some impact on our life at that time
[1:04:08] and uh so i went down there and i was
[1:04:11] testifying as a farmer
[1:04:13] from our area there because at one point
[1:04:16] in time they had a grandus idea that all
[1:04:18] of that out there should just turn into
[1:04:20] a giant housing development and maybe if
[1:04:23] i'd have been smart and really saw i
[1:04:26] could be retired right now
[1:04:29] but i missed that part of it
[1:04:32] and one night after testifying in a
[1:04:35] hearing
[1:04:36] i come out and this lady walks up to me
[1:04:38] very nice lady and she introduces
[1:04:41] herself and she says paul i'm actually
[1:04:43] the canyon county republican chairman
[1:04:48] and we've been noting in these meetings
[1:04:51] how you're able to articulate and and to
[1:04:54] present an idea and get it across to the
[1:04:57] commission and uh we would like for you
[1:04:59] to join the republican party
[1:05:02] and we have a space that we believe paul
[1:05:05] that we could get you into a political
[1:05:08] office and you could make a difference
[1:05:12] and i could feel my head growing
[1:05:18] and after the next meeting once again
[1:05:21] this lady comes
[1:05:22] says
[1:05:24] i just want to tell you paul that no one
[1:05:26] tonight expressed
[1:05:28] that
[1:05:30] the way that you did with clarity and i
[1:05:32] felt my head growing
[1:05:38] and i got to praying
[1:05:43] and just as distinct as my voice is to
[1:05:45] you god's voice was to me
[1:05:48] this
[1:05:49] is not what i gave you this gift for
[1:05:57] i called the lady up i mean she went so
[1:05:59] far as to give me papers on how to sign
[1:06:01] up to
[1:06:02] line up with the party line
[1:06:08] to line up with these things to
[1:06:09] basically i agree with what what the
[1:06:12] republican party in kenyan county stands
[1:06:15] for and i will support this and i
[1:06:18] and
[1:06:20] i'm not interested and you know in their
[1:06:22] world they're just like
[1:06:24] you don't realize what you're turning
[1:06:26] down
[1:06:28] but little do they know that i do know
[1:06:31] when i'm turning down
[1:06:33] because you see
[1:06:35] god didn't put ability in us
[1:06:38] to embrace this world
[1:06:42] one of her arguments is you can make a
[1:06:44] difference
[1:06:46] and i said you're absolutely right
[1:06:49] by god's grace i'm going to make a
[1:06:50] difference
[1:06:52] by god's grace i'm going to take the
[1:06:54] ability that has been given to me
[1:06:57] to act in a certain way to be who i am
[1:07:01] but you see we can have ability without
[1:07:04] having action and then we'll just go
[1:07:06] with the brothers of just brother mason
[1:07:08] go to the very next one what it is
[1:07:10] that in my hand
[1:07:12] amen yes nope there you go
[1:07:15] um
[1:07:16] and the first thing you know
[1:07:19] he's talking
[1:07:21] my brother and sister in a slightly
[1:07:23] different subject but i believe you'll
[1:07:24] catch what i'm talking about and the
[1:07:26] first thing you know he happened to hear
[1:07:28] something come up the road trump trump
[1:07:30] trump trump here comes 600 armed men big
[1:07:34] old brass helmets on they're big old
[1:07:36] iron shoes and there's spears in their
[1:07:37] hand they're big swords hanging at their
[1:07:39] side coming up the road to take his crop
[1:07:42] away from him and i want to introduce
[1:07:44] right here again
[1:07:51] okay i'm not trying to change what the
[1:07:52] prophet said but i just want you to know
[1:07:54] this was again
[1:07:56] just like you and i have had victory
[1:07:59] we've had times where pray through we
[1:08:01] feel the power of god but shamgar had to
[1:08:05] face the enemy again
[1:08:08] and we can't say well praise the lord
[1:08:10] devil you can't touch me he will touch
[1:08:13] you
[1:08:14] your words of saying you can't mean
[1:08:16] nothing to him
[1:08:19] oh look at this and i can see little
[1:08:22] shamgar say oh my
[1:08:24] look at their here it comes
[1:08:27] again
[1:08:30] lord they did it last year i sweated i
[1:08:33] harvested i thrashed i put it in the
[1:08:36] grainery and i'm thinking i can take
[1:08:38] some of this to town and i can buy good
[1:08:40] clothes for my family i can buy some new
[1:08:43] things and the rest will save feed our
[1:08:45] livestock feed my family it's happening
[1:08:49] again
[1:08:53] he looked over at his poor little wife
[1:08:55] and there she was elbows of her dress
[1:08:57] out there's the little children look
[1:08:59] real skinny because they hadn't had
[1:09:01] nothing to eat the philistines took it
[1:09:03] away had took it away that's about like
[1:09:06] some of the christians tonight
[1:09:09] come on saints i'm going to speak direct
[1:09:11] to you today it's like some of the
[1:09:13] people in this
[1:09:18] church a puny thing to be called a
[1:09:22] believer
[1:09:23] a born-again christian amen not enough
[1:09:26] faith to deny if it was inc
[1:09:30] i don't mean to preach hard to you
[1:09:31] saints
[1:09:32] i just want you to know there's
[1:09:34] something better for us
[1:09:36] god's got something better for us he has
[1:09:39] given us now we know what the prophet of
[1:09:41] god taught he said that we don't really
[1:09:43] have power we have authority but my
[1:09:46] brother and sister i'm not trying to
[1:09:47] turn it because you could say well
[1:09:48] brother brown said hear power we're not
[1:09:50] here to get all scrappy about some
[1:09:53] little well you didn't say that quite
[1:09:54] right
[1:09:55] i run into people here and there if you
[1:09:57] quote a quote and don't literally give
[1:09:59] the pause for the comma
[1:10:01] but they feel like you've somehow
[1:10:02] violated it
[1:10:06] well i'm sorry my brother and sister
[1:10:09] life
[1:10:11] is more important than your comma
[1:10:14] the life is in the word
[1:10:16] not in your grammar
[1:10:20] i think that might be why some people
[1:10:21] struggle with the prophet so bad
[1:10:24] but it's right there but it don't fit
[1:10:25] their grammar they they need to
[1:10:27] restructure this they gotta you know no
[1:10:29] he didn't mean it that way he meant this
[1:10:31] i'm sorry this is what he said he didn't
[1:10:33] say that he said this
[1:10:36] even though you believe he meant that or
[1:10:37] should have said that i'm sorry this is
[1:10:39] how he put it he put it down at paul's
[1:10:41] level and to those of you are the more
[1:10:43] intellectual you'll just have to come
[1:10:45] down to my level to grasp it
[1:10:47] yeah
[1:10:48] yeah
[1:10:49] so he looks at this now that's about
[1:10:51] like some of the christians look tonight
[1:10:53] a puny looking thing to be called a
[1:10:55] believer a born-again christian amen not
[1:10:59] enough faith
[1:11:00] to dot an eye if it was inc that's right
[1:11:02] oh my
[1:11:04] don't let the devil come over and take
[1:11:06] the glory of god out of the church
[1:11:09] come on saints let somebody say amen to
[1:11:11] this today we are not going to give the
[1:11:14] devil the opportunity to take the glory
[1:11:17] of god out of this church
[1:11:20] you can get sophisticated and the
[1:11:21] prophet said this and the prophet said
[1:11:23] that and we're not going to do this and
[1:11:25] we're not going to do that well my
[1:11:27] brother and sister i say as it is that
[1:11:29] we are going to do what the holy ghost
[1:11:31] leads us to do and if we are there have
[1:11:34] you ever noticed now i'm not insulting
[1:11:35] my wife i just want to make the point
[1:11:37] she happens to just be in the crosshair
[1:11:40] now
[1:11:40] when i remember when jerry and i first
[1:11:42] got married we would sit down at the
[1:11:43] table just two of us no children we
[1:11:45] might be in a cafe a restaurant at home
[1:11:48] and i would just look down at my food
[1:11:50] and look up and she was finished eating
[1:11:57] she grew up in a house
[1:12:00] full of a lot of siblings
[1:12:04] if you wanted your share
[1:12:07] you dove in you got your share
[1:12:12] that's the way it is with christians
[1:12:16] some people are going to stop and think
[1:12:18] about this a while
[1:12:20] should i apply that quote to my life or
[1:12:23] not
[1:12:26] do you think the fact that brother
[1:12:27] branham said that
[1:12:30] 132 times
[1:12:32] that he meant it
[1:12:36] i'm going to think about this
[1:12:38] a while
[1:12:40] you look across the table
[1:12:42] pardon me no reference back to my my
[1:12:44] wife here but you look across the table
[1:12:46] and somebody else is over there
[1:12:52] and the others say
[1:12:54] i just don't like the way they eat
[1:13:00] they should eat like i eat
[1:13:04] and should study these quotes out for at
[1:13:06] least six months or until they forgot
[1:13:09] why they were studying them
[1:13:12] come on saints we got way too many of
[1:13:14] those people around
[1:13:16] come on as brother stephen berson from
[1:13:19] canada says if you are a believer of
[1:13:22] this message you should know what i'm
[1:13:24] talking about
[1:13:27] i shouldn't have to defend you know well
[1:13:30] if we took this heading off of here
[1:13:34] would you still say amen to this
[1:13:38] i hope so
[1:13:40] i hope so come on
[1:13:43] don't
[1:13:44] let the devil come over and take the
[1:13:45] glory of god out of the church send your
[1:13:47] pastor away and let him get all of these
[1:13:49] here dd's and come back and stand up and
[1:13:51] say
[1:13:53] a
[1:13:55] man
[1:13:57] like a dying calf
[1:14:01] come on
[1:14:05] come on saints
[1:14:07] what you need
[1:14:09] and
[1:14:10] and you know i almost didn't use this
[1:14:12] quote because it's like maybe maybe it'd
[1:14:14] be sound like i'm i'm promoting
[1:14:16] something
[1:14:17] but i'm telling you so just so you'll
[1:14:19] know in advance i went ahead and used
[1:14:21] this quote because lord i want to be
[1:14:24] that kind of pastor i want to be that
[1:14:26] kind of preacher i want to be that kind
[1:14:29] of brother
[1:14:31] not because i think i am but it's
[1:14:33] because that's what i want to be what
[1:14:35] you need is an old-fashioned backwards
[1:14:38] sky-blue sin killing religion of a
[1:14:40] preacher that will preach the truth and
[1:14:43] stand on what god said that that is the
[1:14:45] truth
[1:14:46] and liberate
[1:14:48] the people
[1:14:50] hallelujah
[1:14:52] amen this is not about a man promotion
[1:14:54] this is not about a man worship this is
[1:14:57] about you and i getting the pure word of
[1:15:00] god that takes us when we drift off the
[1:15:03] path and puts us back to the center it
[1:15:06] leads us when we come to the bridge out
[1:15:08] to not think that the message that god
[1:15:11] has given supernaturally to you has come
[1:15:13] to an end but in the bridge out to look
[1:15:16] and realize yes there it is down in the
[1:15:19] stream this bridge of ease of being a
[1:15:22] christian has been torn down but down
[1:15:24] here in the stream god provided a rock i
[1:15:27] hope you're with me he provided a rock
[1:15:29] and we can stretch you've done it in
[1:15:32] your youth amen we get older it's harder
[1:15:35] but you've done it in your youth
[1:15:42] look what's happening
[1:15:45] bridge out
[1:15:48] you're not for 48 years i i guess i just
[1:15:51] realized this isn't true
[1:15:55] after 48 years
[1:15:57] you should be so
[1:16:00] anchored
[1:16:02] to realize revelation revelation
[1:16:04] revelation revelation revelation and
[1:16:07] sometimes you have to give all you've
[1:16:09] got to get to the next one but lord help
[1:16:12] me if it's the truth i want to believe
[1:16:15] it and you make that leap of faith and
[1:16:17] you land on that rock of revelation and
[1:16:20] god confirms it in your life and then
[1:16:22] the people look over and say didn't you
[1:16:24] get the memo the bridge is out
[1:16:28] no i didn't
[1:16:30] no i didn't because i have a provided
[1:16:32] way that god gave me and it was
[1:16:34] revelation that he gave me in his word
[1:16:38] i'm not important
[1:16:39] i just took the leap of faith
[1:16:46] and i'll tell you saints because this is
[1:16:47] the truth sometimes in that leap of
[1:16:49] faith you're in the air
[1:16:53] and you're stretched out
[1:16:55] and you're looking at the rock
[1:16:57] and the closer you get to the rock
[1:16:59] you realize there's moss on the rock and
[1:17:02] the devil says this is the end of you
[1:17:05] but god comes down and supernaturally
[1:17:08] lets your foot land right between the
[1:17:11] moss
[1:17:12] and whatever would be there to stumble
[1:17:15] you amen
[1:17:18] reminds me of a friend of mine preached
[1:17:20] one time
[1:17:22] he said the problem we have in the
[1:17:23] stream of life
[1:17:25] is as people move from
[1:17:27] the rock of revelation to the rock of
[1:17:28] revelation
[1:17:31] they fell off the rock
[1:17:33] sounds terrible doesn't
[1:17:36] except for the fact if we'd all be
[1:17:37] honest
[1:17:38] we'd have to say we've fallen off the
[1:17:40] rock
[1:17:42] his point was when you've fallen off the
[1:17:44] rock now comes another decision
[1:17:47] are you going to go that way to the
[1:17:49] shore
[1:17:50] or that way to the shore
[1:17:55] well praise the lord you know we'd
[1:17:56] actually make really good people out
[1:17:58] here good people
[1:17:59] saints if we just all walked away and we
[1:18:01] just devoted ourselves to careers and
[1:18:04] raising our families good you'll meet
[1:18:06] them
[1:18:07] great people don't know if there's a god
[1:18:08] or not
[1:18:09] they got polite children
[1:18:11] well-ordered family
[1:18:14] you think we'll do okay
[1:18:16] we'll do okay
[1:18:19] but the scripture shows us there's a
[1:18:20] great chasm
[1:18:23] that separates heaven and hell
[1:18:27] there's no way to get across that one
[1:18:31] so remember when you fall off the rock
[1:18:34] you get back on the rock or you have to
[1:18:36] choose between which shore you're going
[1:18:38] for
[1:18:38] go to the one you were headed to in the
[1:18:40] beginning
[1:18:42] you know i i know a man i consider him a
[1:18:45] friend
[1:18:45] had a great you might say breach in his
[1:18:48] life a great struggle in his life
[1:18:51] and he come to a
[1:18:52] place he had a choice
[1:18:55] believe it or not a lot of people would
[1:18:57] said i could totally understand if he'd
[1:18:59] walked away
[1:19:01] but this brother bore his shame
[1:19:05] of this breach in his life
[1:19:07] bore the shame
[1:19:09] and come straight back to the cross
[1:19:12] because he said even though i failed in
[1:19:14] my flesh
[1:19:15] where could i go
[1:19:18] where could i go
[1:19:21] what could i do
[1:19:23] yes i failed i failed miserably but what
[1:19:27] could i do where could i go
[1:19:30] and he bore the shame
[1:19:32] of this breach in his
[1:19:34] life and he's pressing forward
[1:19:38] because he said i would rather bear the
[1:19:40] shame
[1:19:41] and stand before the lord repented
[1:19:45] than to run from
[1:19:48] myself amazing
[1:19:52] so we want some sin killing religion
[1:19:55] that will preach the truth and stand on
[1:19:57] what god said that is the truth and
[1:19:58] liberate the people amen i'm not rude i
[1:20:01] don't mean to be but brother it's time
[1:20:03] we brought or made black black and white
[1:20:06] white
[1:20:08] come on let's get that out of the
[1:20:09] message it's creeping in did you know
[1:20:11] that you just let those vines just go
[1:20:14] and you know it's amazing you know house
[1:20:16] there on the farm we're working on and
[1:20:18] there's rose bushes on the outside of
[1:20:20] the house and you go down in the
[1:20:21] basement and there's rose bushes on the
[1:20:23] inside of the house
[1:20:26] because given time they work their way
[1:20:28] in
[1:20:29] and so you look at this it's time saints
[1:20:31] it's grace tabernacle in a position we
[1:20:34] would lift a hand and say lord we want
[1:20:37] black to be black and white to be white
[1:20:40] we don't want some hybrid religion we
[1:20:43] don't want to gloss this over we want
[1:20:45] some sin killing preaching and sin
[1:20:47] killing preaching isn't to shame or
[1:20:50] insult or to beat down it is the liberty
[1:20:54] in christ jesus
[1:20:56] amen that brings us to this thing right
[1:20:58] now look i'm not rude i mean but
[1:21:00] brothers it's time we brought made black
[1:21:02] black white white yes sir you get god in
[1:21:06] your camp and you'll hear the shout
[1:21:08] again in the camp of the king when you
[1:21:10] get the thing fixed up
[1:21:13] i'll tell you as a preacher i'm not
[1:21:14] wanting to just hear shouting for
[1:21:16] shouting's sake but i want to hear a
[1:21:18] shout of victory all the way from our
[1:21:20] little ones to the oldest in ole miss i
[1:21:23] want to hear a shout in the camp that we
[1:21:26] can say my god is real my god is real i
[1:21:30] don't have a doubt of who it is that i
[1:21:32] serve
[1:21:33] hallelujah
[1:21:35] i'm telling you my brother and sister
[1:21:37] it's time sometimes you know we can we
[1:21:39] can get to a place you know we're so
[1:21:41] afraid
[1:21:43] we're so afraid around the message
[1:21:46] people are so afraid to just say well
[1:21:49] i feel weak
[1:21:51] i feel discouraged
[1:21:54] won't be long before they're gone
[1:21:58] where did that spirit come from
[1:22:00] didn't come from god
[1:22:02] in fact it said that we should actually
[1:22:04] share our burdens with one another
[1:22:09] now some of that maybe need to be age
[1:22:11] sensitive
[1:22:13] right
[1:22:14] not gonna come over and
[1:22:17] spill your heart about some very deep
[1:22:19] thing that would just blow some young
[1:22:20] person right out of the water and they'd
[1:22:22] be like what
[1:22:25] but at the same time we've become so
[1:22:27] proud
[1:22:29] can we say that word proud
[1:22:33] is that okay to say in a message church
[1:22:37] we become so proud
[1:22:39] that we're ready to go down in flames
[1:22:42] and we're not going to let a single soul
[1:22:45] know about it
[1:22:48] because what if they know about it
[1:22:51] what will they think of me
[1:22:53] okay let's just this is off the track
[1:22:55] but i just feel led to do this let's
[1:22:56] just diagnose that for a moment
[1:22:58] they know you're struggling they know
[1:23:00] you have doubts you have fears you feel
[1:23:02] worthless you've made mistake after
[1:23:04] mistake after mistake and what am i
[1:23:06] going to do if they know about it
[1:23:09] well praise the lord
[1:23:10] there's only two sides of that aisle
[1:23:13] there's going to be those that look of
[1:23:15] you
[1:23:16] and you know what
[1:23:17] have you ever worked with someone who
[1:23:19] waited until you put it all back
[1:23:22] together
[1:23:26] and right when you put the last bolt in
[1:23:29] they go
[1:23:30] [Laughter]
[1:23:32] told you so
[1:23:34] what are you going to do with this piece
[1:23:37] it goes on the inside behind this this
[1:23:39] this this and this and this
[1:23:41] i told you so
[1:23:45] hmm
[1:23:49] lock the door on the shop
[1:23:51] i don't need friends like that right
[1:23:56] or you tell them i made a mistake in my
[1:23:58] life
[1:24:00] and all of a sudden with this youth
[1:24:02] brothers all of a sudden there's a whole
[1:24:03] band of brothers
[1:24:05] wrapped around this man
[1:24:07] lord this
[1:24:09] is a sinner
[1:24:12] no
[1:24:13] this is my brother amen
[1:24:17] and we're gonna take on a musk ox
[1:24:20] anointing
[1:24:22] you know what i'm talking about
[1:24:23] hallelujah
[1:24:25] the enemies out there the enemy's not in
[1:24:27] here come on are you with me enemies not
[1:24:30] in here the enemies out there so we
[1:24:32] don't turn and face one another we turn
[1:24:34] and face out and say you know what devil
[1:24:36] this is my brother and i'm gonna stand
[1:24:39] on the word and maybe he's not anointed
[1:24:41] to take the word as we have just read
[1:24:44] those quotes maybe he's not in a
[1:24:46] position to speak from authority but we
[1:24:49] are
[1:24:50] and devil we will fight with you to the
[1:24:52] bitter end
[1:24:54] hallelujah
[1:24:57] oh hallelujah
[1:24:59] i could just go off and preach on that i
[1:25:01] even have a couple quotes that would go
[1:25:02] with that thought
[1:25:03] hallelujah
[1:25:05] see what
[1:25:07] look what happened we put our god-given
[1:25:09] ability to action now look we want to do
[1:25:12] this here uh in just a nice way because
[1:25:15] this is just part of a sermon ongoing
[1:25:17] uh now he promised of a coming church a
[1:25:20] coming kingdom
[1:25:21] now turn right over in acts 1 8 and
[1:25:24] remember he spoke also in matthew 16 18
[1:25:27] upon this rock now look my brother and
[1:25:29] sister this promise of a coming church
[1:25:31] this was not for us to say oh
[1:25:34] none of those other ages had anything we
[1:25:36] and laodicea have it all
[1:25:39] no no no
[1:25:40] prophet himself says that i'm here to
[1:25:43] correct some of the air of ages gone by
[1:25:46] to remind you of the truth of ages gone
[1:25:50] by and to reveal the last revelation as
[1:25:54] it were and the ra last revelations not
[1:25:57] new gospel
[1:25:59] see that's where the critics i just read
[1:26:01] a deal the other day oh they think they
[1:26:02] got something new
[1:26:04] no i'm sorry don't have one thing new
[1:26:06] everything i believe is right here
[1:26:08] contained in this bible
[1:26:11] but not all of it's in order
[1:26:14] now i'll tell you i've offered a job to
[1:26:16] my granddaughter elia
[1:26:20] i've got collection through the years
[1:26:23] of abandoned message books people quit
[1:26:27] they do have enough respect not to throw
[1:26:29] them in a dumpster
[1:26:30] and they say here paul take the books
[1:26:33] i've got anointed and last a little
[1:26:35] while and i've just been putting
[1:26:38] all of this together and i have
[1:26:40] 65 64. you know you see what i'm saying
[1:26:43] and going on
[1:26:44] now the thing is is i consider myself a
[1:26:47] busy man except for when i'm too lazy to
[1:26:49] be busy
[1:26:50] but um you know i offered my
[1:26:52] granddaughter i i
[1:26:54] i'm gonna pay you sweetie
[1:26:55] to take these books out
[1:26:58] because there's duplicates
[1:27:00] and it's just a big mess and i want you
[1:27:02] to go through and sort this out for me
[1:27:06] now my brother and sister
[1:27:08] when we look at the ages
[1:27:11] god said i'm going to provide some men
[1:27:15] that are going to come
[1:27:16] they're going to sort this out and put
[1:27:18] it in order for you
[1:27:21] aaliyah is not going to start printing
[1:27:23] books
[1:27:26] she's going to set it in order
[1:27:30] the prophet didn't come and try to print
[1:27:32] a new bible
[1:27:34] he just said it in order
[1:27:37] and regardless of what critics might say
[1:27:39] saints just remember the prophet of god
[1:27:42] was here to set the word of god in order
[1:27:44] for our life
[1:27:46] so that we could follow that we could
[1:27:48] find the correct order of it and so he
[1:27:51] says here in matthew 16 upon this rock
[1:27:53] he would build his church and the gates
[1:27:55] of hell should not prevail against it
[1:27:57] we're going to get to that just a few
[1:27:59] minutes as we go on down to the other
[1:28:01] subject acts 1 8 but you sell you shall
[1:28:04] receive power after the holy ghost has
[1:28:06] come upon you and you shall be witnesses
[1:28:09] unto me both in jerusalem judea samaria
[1:28:12] and to the utmost parts of the world a
[1:28:14] coming kingdom
[1:28:16] of witnesses
[1:28:18] i like how brother branham puts that
[1:28:19] it's just very simplistic but it's very
[1:28:21] deep
[1:28:22] amen not a coming a witness of
[1:28:25] theologians or a coming you know
[1:28:28] time where we have to learn i have no
[1:28:31] problem with people learning other
[1:28:33] languages that's fine some are just very
[1:28:34] gifted
[1:28:36] but if we think we got to go learn
[1:28:37] hebrew before we can read our bible
[1:28:40] then we got the wrong anointing
[1:28:42] yeah
[1:28:43] oh and by the way
[1:28:45] all the hebrew historians
[1:28:48] are arguing
[1:28:50] about which
[1:28:51] sub
[1:28:52] dialect you know kind of like down the
[1:28:53] south have you ever drove up to a
[1:28:55] wendy's in the south yeah
[1:28:56] why are we
[1:28:58] wall
[1:29:02] what was that
[1:29:05] why we wanna
[1:29:10] uh i think the speaker's got a problem i
[1:29:12] i don't know what you're saying
[1:29:14] somebody else comes to the deal would
[1:29:16] you like to order
[1:29:19] i don't know what he said
[1:29:24] my brother and sister you take all these
[1:29:26] minds
[1:29:27] that have approached the gospel
[1:29:29] from theology
[1:29:31] and to the bride of christ it's
[1:29:34] won
[1:29:36] but he said my sheep hear my voice
[1:29:40] hallelujah
[1:29:42] we had a time like that we actually
[1:29:44] drove away it's a it's a lovely time
[1:29:47] and uh we drove away and pulled just up
[1:29:49] the street we're in happy valley
[1:29:51] tennessee and we wanted to make the
[1:29:52] wednesday night service and and so we're
[1:29:55] going to eat something really fast and
[1:29:56] drive straight to church and be there
[1:29:58] on time and and so we pulled up the
[1:30:01] street pulled over prayed started
[1:30:03] pulling food out and it's like
[1:30:05] nobody ordered a baconator
[1:30:10] where's our french fries
[1:30:12] who ordered a triple cheeseburger
[1:30:17] well imagine on the inside our perfect
[1:30:21] northwest no accent voice
[1:30:24] was
[1:30:25] wa
[1:30:33] and that's why
[1:30:35] when you witness
[1:30:36] to many people the devil tries to say
[1:30:39] you blew it i just heard one of you i
[1:30:40] wouldn't even mention who it was in the
[1:30:42] last i'm gonna i'm gonna stretch it out
[1:30:43] so you won't even wrack your brain on
[1:30:45] this in the last few months i heard one
[1:30:46] of you say to me well i witnessed the
[1:30:49] sky and i said this and said that i just
[1:30:51] really blew it
[1:30:54] did you
[1:30:56] you can't help it
[1:30:58] if what they heard was
[1:31:00] why we
[1:31:05] but if you ever have the opportunity to
[1:31:08] witness
[1:31:09] to one of gods
[1:31:12] they are just like now you said in the
[1:31:14] bible i've never read that before well
[1:31:16] let me show you
[1:31:18] they read it and they go oh my god
[1:31:23] but as long as you're talking to that
[1:31:25] other spirit it comes out
[1:31:27] while we
[1:31:28] wa
[1:31:31] anyway we had quite a laugh
[1:31:34] but i tell you we were all hungry enough
[1:31:35] like a good believer would be if he went
[1:31:37] to church
[1:31:40] first thing was we ought to take this
[1:31:41] back and make him fix it second thing
[1:31:43] was we'll be late for church if we make
[1:31:45] them fix this so i think i'll eat a
[1:31:47] baconator
[1:31:49] and i'll eat this and i'll eat a soggy
[1:31:51] fish sandwich and i'll eat some chicken
[1:31:53] toasted whatever
[1:31:57] but you see
[1:31:59] if you can't have the same language
[1:32:02] there's no matter we could have walked
[1:32:04] inside we might have had to stood on the
[1:32:06] counter and pointed at their board this
[1:32:09] one
[1:32:17] that you shall receive power after the
[1:32:19] holy ghost has come upon you and you
[1:32:20] shall be witnesses and unto me both in
[1:32:22] jerusalem judea samaria and the utmost
[1:32:24] parts of the world a coming kingdom of
[1:32:27] witnesses witnesses of what
[1:32:31] his resurrection
[1:32:33] you realize my brother and sister now
[1:32:35] look at this
[1:32:36] witnesses of his resurrection witnesses
[1:32:39] of his power witnesses of his
[1:32:43] being
[1:32:44] alive
[1:32:47] we're just speaking to you the other
[1:32:49] night what what is the vindication of
[1:32:51] this message the prophet's own words not
[1:32:53] my words the prophet's own words is he
[1:32:56] declared you are the vindication of this
[1:33:00] message
[1:33:01] he didn't say i am the vindication and
[1:33:04] so all the rest of you just live like a
[1:33:06] bunch of alley rats because it's already
[1:33:08] been proven to be true he turned that
[1:33:10] right around and said you're gonna
[1:33:12] vindicate that this word of god is true
[1:33:15] in this hour
[1:33:16] you're gonna be the one that lives the
[1:33:19] life and the gospel of christ in the day
[1:33:21] that we live in i say thank you lord for
[1:33:24] such a promotion
[1:33:26] hallelujah hallelujah
[1:33:29] witnesses of his resurrection witness of
[1:33:31] his power witness of his of being alive
[1:33:34] you're my witnesses
[1:33:36] acts 1 8.
[1:33:38] now you look at that my brother and
[1:33:39] sister and we also find
[1:33:42] oh where are we at here
[1:33:45] you're my witnesses okay five definite
[1:33:48] identifications now look at this let's
[1:33:50] go to the next one
[1:33:53] then we also find the ephesians the
[1:33:55] first chapter 22nd verse that uh you
[1:33:57] that's putting that down this is plenty
[1:33:59] of it to put down now just to nail it
[1:34:01] down to make sure that that you see it
[1:34:03] all right see brother brown's not just
[1:34:05] worried about how much he can preach he
[1:34:07] wants you to see it yes
[1:34:11] if you have to be labor you know i've
[1:34:13] taught this to the church i i say todd
[1:34:15] i've expressed it as an opinion of what
[1:34:17] i do and i'd hoped somehow it would grab
[1:34:20] some of you my brother and sister
[1:34:22] reading the bible in the year means
[1:34:24] nothing if you didn't get one thing out
[1:34:26] of your bible in that year
[1:34:29] oh praise the lord i read you know
[1:34:31] especially those ones that have you read
[1:34:33] three verses out of this and two verses
[1:34:35] here and four verses there you'll be
[1:34:38] like me and my message books
[1:34:40] well i believe it was
[1:34:44] i don't know where it was in the bible i
[1:34:46] read it
[1:34:48] why don't we just stop
[1:34:50] and let's just focus on one thing
[1:34:53] till we understand it till we get it
[1:34:58] come on
[1:35:02] yeah
[1:35:04] i could elaborate on that but it's times
[1:35:06] fleeting
[1:35:09] you see it all right 22nd verse of
[1:35:11] ephesians the first chapter has put all
[1:35:13] things under his feet that's christ and
[1:35:15] gave him to be the head over the things
[1:35:17] to the church that's us which is his
[1:35:20] body
[1:35:22] oh he's only talking theologically
[1:35:27] okay
[1:35:28] and the fullness of him that filleth all
[1:35:30] in all who set this church up
[1:35:34] jesus christ
[1:35:35] now i'm not promoting myself for
[1:35:37] defending myself saints don't
[1:35:38] misunderstand me but you see now the
[1:35:39] foundation of why paul doesn't like you
[1:35:41] to call this paul's church
[1:35:43] i go to paul haylett's church i'm sorry
[1:35:46] i don't know where you go then because
[1:35:47] paul haley didn't go to church
[1:35:50] jesus christ has got a church on midland
[1:35:52] boulevard
[1:35:53] paul haylett doesn't at all no bishop
[1:35:58] no group of men no pope no man-made
[1:36:02] powers at all
[1:36:03] but jesus christ spoke of it being his
[1:36:06] kingdom that was coming in power
[1:36:08] you know what this is that's me i'm
[1:36:10] going to tell you right now i'm coming
[1:36:11] in power
[1:36:12] sister jerry and i was just talking just
[1:36:14] casually husband wife believer brother
[1:36:16] sister however you want to look at it
[1:36:18] you know and we're talking about
[1:36:19] maturity and i'm telling you what we say
[1:36:21] thank you lord we are coming in maturity
[1:36:23] until we are not very mature
[1:36:27] and then we're suddenly like oh yes
[1:36:31] i didn't have a get out of jail i didn't
[1:36:33] have an exemption card
[1:36:34] and there's things
[1:36:37] about me that are not very mature
[1:36:40] shocking isn't it
[1:36:44] don't feel condemned
[1:36:46] lift a hand up and say thank you lord
[1:36:49] you showed me a portion of my life
[1:36:52] that i've been so focused over here i
[1:36:54] had a friend i hope you don't mind me
[1:36:56] sharing this this kind of silly comment
[1:36:58] i had a friend in school he was actually
[1:36:59] quite good as an artist
[1:37:01] and he liked to draw these deals and he
[1:37:02] had all these quirky things and so he
[1:37:05] would have the cartoon of the man
[1:37:07] working out only his right arm and he
[1:37:10] would draw this cartoon and it would
[1:37:12] show this guy screen skinny skinny old
[1:37:14] body and over here was this shoulder
[1:37:17] that bulged out in a huge bicep and
[1:37:19] ripple of muscles but the rest of him
[1:37:21] was this little wimpy thing
[1:37:23] and then he would draw the man who only
[1:37:25] worked at his left arm and guy that only
[1:37:27] worked out from the waist up and all
[1:37:29] these comics were funny little pencil
[1:37:31] legs you know in this big huge upper
[1:37:34] body like whoa
[1:37:36] or the guy who only worked out his legs
[1:37:38] and his upper body was like sunken chest
[1:37:41] and pencil arms
[1:37:43] and i remember that later as i become a
[1:37:45] minister just as i'm recounting it to
[1:37:47] you you see it's not about well praise
[1:37:49] the lord i got into this part of the
[1:37:51] word and now i can tell you every comma
[1:37:53] and whatever blah blah blah that the
[1:37:55] prophet said about this right here
[1:38:01] and they got all these skinny little
[1:38:02] legs
[1:38:09] intellectually worked out
[1:38:12] great big head
[1:38:14] great big ears and eyes nose
[1:38:19] nothing else
[1:38:21] god wants a balanced message
[1:38:23] god wants us to say lord what is it but
[1:38:26] you see he's doing that when he roots up
[1:38:28] in us something that we go oh my
[1:38:32] that response that behavior wasn't very
[1:38:34] mature
[1:38:36] of course there's always some husbands
[1:38:38] and wives and friends that'd be like
[1:38:40] told you so
[1:38:43] forget about them
[1:38:44] listen to god amen he's working on you
[1:38:47] saints
[1:38:48] he's building you into what he wants you
[1:38:50] to be
[1:38:51] amen
[1:38:53] now let me get back on track
[1:38:56] where was i
[1:38:58] i've got lost
[1:39:01] no no bishop no group of men no pope no
[1:39:03] man-made powers at all but jesus spoke
[1:39:05] of it being his kingdom that was coming
[1:39:07] in power some stands here 16th chapter
[1:39:10] of matthew verily i say unto you some
[1:39:12] stands here shall not see death until we
[1:39:14] see the kingdom of god coming in power
[1:39:18] you know how we've always interpreted
[1:39:20] that
[1:39:21] there are some they're going to be alive
[1:39:23] they're not going to see death
[1:39:25] until they see the coming of the lord in
[1:39:27] power
[1:39:30] that's the way it's interpreted
[1:39:32] i want to throw
[1:39:34] a curveball at you
[1:39:37] some of you
[1:39:38] called the bride
[1:39:40] are not going to see death
[1:39:42] until god has opened up the power of his
[1:39:45] word and the kingdom of god is going to
[1:39:48] come into you in power satan can't take
[1:39:51] you until all the revelation of jesus
[1:39:54] christ has been manifested in you as a
[1:39:57] son or daughter of god so don't worry
[1:40:00] about oh i'm afraid i might die here or
[1:40:02] what would happen here whatever as sons
[1:40:05] and daughters of god you will be filled
[1:40:07] with the fullness of the gospel of jesus
[1:40:09] christ before he will take you home
[1:40:12] he's not going to get you up to heaven
[1:40:14] and give you a personal tutor to get you
[1:40:16] ready to go on in
[1:40:18] you are going to be filled with the word
[1:40:20] right here amen now i'm not trying to
[1:40:22] pervert the word so nobody misunderstand
[1:40:24] that but you look at this my brother and
[1:40:26] sister have confidence that the kingdom
[1:40:28] of god is going to come to maturity in
[1:40:30] you
[1:40:32] oh i need more patience pray for
[1:40:34] patience i can't bring myself to pray
[1:40:36] for patience then just hold on god will
[1:40:39] give you patience
[1:40:43] coming just a few days after that he was
[1:40:45] crucified and the holy ghost fell some
[1:40:47] stands here shall not see death until
[1:40:49] they see the kingdom of god
[1:40:51] amen now look at this my brother and
[1:40:53] sister how beautiful this is
[1:40:55] will thou restore the kingdom at this
[1:40:58] time the jews ask him and he said it's
[1:40:59] not for you to know the time or the
[1:41:01] season that the father has put in his
[1:41:03] own mind but you shall receive power
[1:41:07] you shall receive power after the holy
[1:41:09] ghost has come upon you you shall
[1:41:11] receive power after you are made a
[1:41:13] bishop
[1:41:15] after you are made a preacher after
[1:41:17] you're made a pope after you're made a
[1:41:20] priest you shall receive power after the
[1:41:24] holy ghost has come upon you oh i want
[1:41:27] to be able to weld the power of almighty
[1:41:30] god i don't want to just walk through
[1:41:32] this life being buffeted to the right
[1:41:34] and to the left but here is a secret my
[1:41:36] brother and sister we got to die to
[1:41:38] ourselves i got up early this morning
[1:41:40] and i'm sitting in the office in there a
[1:41:42] little tired in the body and i'm just
[1:41:44] sitting there and i was just thinking
[1:41:46] about these things and i thought oh lord
[1:41:49] look lord i don't want to go through
[1:41:52] this life right here and find out i
[1:41:55] missed an opportunity here and i missed
[1:41:57] an opportunity here and i missed an
[1:41:59] opportunity here and there was a time
[1:42:01] that i by dying to myself and then the
[1:42:04] lord spoke to me and said it's really
[1:42:06] hard
[1:42:07] it's really hard paul
[1:42:10] to die to yourself
[1:42:13] half-hearted commitment
[1:42:15] will not bring death
[1:42:17] to self amen
[1:42:21] come on
[1:42:23] now i don't want this to be depressing
[1:42:25] actually it has a good ending
[1:42:27] it's a man one time in san francisco
[1:42:30] tried to commit suicide with a gun he
[1:42:32] didn't have the courage to pull the
[1:42:33] trigger
[1:42:34] he's going to poison himself but he had
[1:42:36] read about how painful that was so he
[1:42:38] poured it down the drain
[1:42:39] and he done all of these things tried to
[1:42:41] play chicken on the freeway got pulled
[1:42:42] over cop thought he was drunk
[1:42:48] walks out in the middle of the golden
[1:42:50] gate bridge
[1:42:52] and he says now
[1:42:54] will be the time that i'll end my life
[1:42:57] and there'll be not one thing i can do
[1:43:00] to turn it around
[1:43:02] and he stood like a tourist
[1:43:04] looking over the rail
[1:43:06] and when there was no cars close to him
[1:43:09] he climbed over the rail and just pushed
[1:43:10] off
[1:43:14] now you catch something from this
[1:43:17] he says the minute he pushed off he had
[1:43:19] regrets
[1:43:21] kind of tells you a little of the story
[1:43:23] doesn't it
[1:43:25] you're going to find this amazing
[1:43:27] there's a man
[1:43:28] getting the deck of a freighter large
[1:43:31] ship ready
[1:43:33] to go into the harbor to unload
[1:43:36] and he was the chief you might say of
[1:43:38] all the workers on the boat and he looks
[1:43:39] out and he sees this pile of rags laying
[1:43:41] on the deck of the ship and he thought
[1:43:43] which one of my lazy guys left this and
[1:43:45] he goes over there to pick it up and
[1:43:47] here the pile of rags is moaning
[1:43:54] they call
[1:43:55] they get medical help for him
[1:43:58] you know if god doesn't want it to
[1:44:00] happen it can't happen
[1:44:02] this was a large ship with a huge crane
[1:44:05] mounted on it and
[1:44:06] he fell from the bridge and he hit the
[1:44:09] cable
[1:44:10] and he went sliding down the cable
[1:44:14] and he shot off the end of the cable and
[1:44:15] he bounced off of some deal and
[1:44:17] ricocheted off of this and come to rest
[1:44:18] on the deck and
[1:44:20] only had a couple broken bones
[1:44:25] in the hospital when he got healthy they
[1:44:27] had him under suicide watch
[1:44:29] one day he told the doctor he said after
[1:44:31] that kind of experience
[1:44:34] you don't have to worry about me trying
[1:44:36] again
[1:44:40] you see
[1:44:41] god is in control
[1:44:43] god is in control sense
[1:44:45] amen
[1:44:47] but we want to have the power right here
[1:44:49] without having to go through that kind
[1:44:50] of experience to realize life is
[1:44:52] precious
[1:44:54] amen you shall receive power if the holy
[1:44:56] ghost has come upon you that's the
[1:44:57] witness that god was looking for a
[1:45:00] witness
[1:45:01] after
[1:45:02] amen come on if i can drive this home a
[1:45:04] witness after the holy ghost has come
[1:45:07] upon them amen
[1:45:09] not a witness that i'm a bishop not a
[1:45:11] witness that i'm a pastor but a witness
[1:45:14] of what of the resurrected king that's
[1:45:17] the true church of the living god all
[1:45:19] right hallelujah amen we're preaching
[1:45:22] today saints to you and this thought i
[1:45:24] never really spoke on it but the
[1:45:26] recognition and the action of the true
[1:45:28] church
[1:45:29] amen this church is going to recognize
[1:45:31] the word of god she's going to see what
[1:45:33] god has chose to do in her amen so it's
[1:45:36] there that we want to come to this place
[1:45:39] and can i have just a couple more
[1:45:40] minutes amen it's a time that we come to
[1:45:43] the place to real right we're not a
[1:45:45] witness of a church
[1:45:48] we're not witness of a pastor i go to
[1:45:50] brother so-and-so's church
[1:45:53] i've never heard of him
[1:45:57] in their mind you must be living under a
[1:45:59] rock
[1:46:00] in my mind god brought me the message
[1:46:03] amen
[1:46:04] and he used great men
[1:46:07] to bring the message to me
[1:46:13] i know this is going to be a little
[1:46:15] graphic some of you might not like my
[1:46:17] example
[1:46:19] but you didn't see
[1:46:22] rebecca jump off a camel
[1:46:24] and run over to the
[1:46:26] camel
[1:46:28] caretaker oh my thank you go over here
[1:46:31] to the cook

[1:46:41] no sir she had one love
[1:46:43] she knew all of them had helped her get
[1:46:45] here but this was the reason he's the
[1:46:47] reason he's the one of why i have
[1:46:50] traveled through the desert why have
[1:46:52] been dirty and sweaty and why we have
[1:46:54] been concerned about the bandits with
[1:46:56] false message
[1:47:00] he's the one
[1:47:01] amen hallelujah
[1:47:04] hallelujah i hope that wasn't too
[1:47:05] graphic forgive me
[1:47:09] hallelujah what is the church the mystic
[1:47:11] body of christ who set it up the lord
[1:47:14] jesus himself it wasn't set up at rome
[1:47:17] neither was it set up in england by john
[1:47:19] wesley and it was set up by calvin or in
[1:47:21] america the baptist by john smith
[1:47:22] neither was it set up in california by
[1:47:24] the pentecostals it was set up by jesus
[1:47:27] christ the king of the messianic kingdom
[1:47:30] that's who it was set up by he is the
[1:47:33] king he wants to be king he wants to
[1:47:36] rule us
[1:47:37] oh now look at this hang on put your
[1:47:39] seat belt on
[1:47:40] amen those he read ahead not he naughty
[1:47:44] he wants to be king he wants to rule us
[1:47:46] he wants to be lord people let him let
[1:47:50] him in say i'll let him be savior
[1:47:53] but they won't let him be lord
[1:47:55] lord means
[1:47:57] ownership
[1:48:07] i believe the message
[1:48:10] are you owned
[1:48:12] by the one who wrote it
[1:48:18] ownership rulership come into my heart
[1:48:20] lord save me from hell
[1:48:22] but don't tell me what to do
[1:48:25] my
[1:48:27] that's the attitude of the people
[1:48:30] that's rough saints
[1:48:32] that's rough but it's truth
[1:48:34] amen lord help us to die to ourself amen
[1:48:38] i believe it's the reason the lord just
[1:48:39] spoke to my heart this morning it's one
[1:48:42] thing to say i believe that it is hard
[1:48:46] to die to self
[1:48:48] and let's not act like the preacher must
[1:48:50] have it together and we're the only one
[1:48:52] that struggles with this every one of us
[1:48:54] that is living breathing human beings
[1:48:57] has to struggle to die to ourself
[1:49:02] that's why we should not turn in and
[1:49:04] cannibalize our own but we should stand
[1:49:07] and say i don't care what happened in
[1:49:09] your life we're going to turn like the
[1:49:12] musk ox and we're gonna face the devil
[1:49:14] and tell them devil you're gonna have to
[1:49:16] go through this whole church
[1:49:19] if you want my brother or you want my
[1:49:21] sister you're gonna have to go through
[1:49:23] the whole church
[1:49:26] because you know that old phrase divide
[1:49:28] and conquer didn't just come from
[1:49:29] nowhere
[1:49:32] no that's that's the devil he said that
[1:49:34] was such a good idea
[1:49:36] i'll just let the whole world share that
[1:49:37] one
[1:49:38] but thank the lord that's not our
[1:49:39] attitude is it
[1:49:41] okay i want to close
[1:49:43] sister will you come
[1:49:45] and been musicians
[1:49:46] now brother brown says right here
[1:49:50] and i think it's only fair you know i i
[1:49:52] have brothers tell me that you're
[1:49:54] true too transparent paul
[1:49:56] i'm working on hiding things from you
[1:50:00] i'm i'm kind of struggling with that but
[1:50:02] i'll work on i'll get better hiding
[1:50:04] things from you
[1:50:06] but for the moment being transparent
[1:50:08] this is a quote my wife sent to me
[1:50:11] it wasn't even my own studies and i
[1:50:13] pruned it down because i knew it was
[1:50:15] right here at the end and i knew that i
[1:50:16] would have preached too long
[1:50:18] but i want you to catch this right here
[1:50:20] christ
[1:50:21] is the mystery of god revealed i think
[1:50:23] the title says it all
[1:50:26] who we you know listen to it read it but
[1:50:29] look just in the title it says it all
[1:50:32] now look at this see what i mean
[1:50:36] he has begun to give life into his body
[1:50:41] no longer religion
[1:50:44] he's not given religion to his body
[1:50:47] he's not given a theology or a doctorate
[1:50:51] or
[1:50:52] oh my
[1:50:54] i was with so and so
[1:50:57] i knew so and so
[1:51:00] i've traveled with so-and-so
[1:51:05] okay
[1:51:06] that's good some of that's really neat
[1:51:15] but he's begin to give life
[1:51:18] into his body why
[1:51:21] why
[1:51:22] the one he's redeemed
[1:51:26] it's not how much of the message we can
[1:51:28] quote
[1:51:29] it's not how big our church is
[1:51:31] [Music]
[1:51:33] it's not how
[1:51:35] however you want to measure it
[1:51:38] this is what he's doing to his redeemed
[1:51:40] he's pouring life into her
[1:51:46] the mediatorial work
[1:51:48] is done amen
[1:51:53] people are like you can't believe this
[1:51:54] or that because if you believe this or
[1:51:57] that that means christ off the mercy
[1:51:59] seat they forgot to go and study it
[1:52:02] it's and it's sad because we live in a
[1:52:04] day i remember an old message preacher
[1:52:06] good good old brother he's passed on to
[1:52:08] the to his reward
[1:52:10] he looked me in the face one day and he
[1:52:11] says paul
[1:52:14] you guys are spoiled
[1:52:18] okay
[1:52:20] he said when i started preaching this
[1:52:22] message
[1:52:23] he said i had
[1:52:25] every message book i could get ahold of
[1:52:28] and then i had almost an equal amount of
[1:52:30] books
[1:52:31] that were references where to find it in
[1:52:32] those books
[1:52:35] i want to know about baptism he said i
[1:52:38] had under b
[1:52:39] under baptism
[1:52:41] every uh this message right here this
[1:52:43] page this one this page just
[1:52:46] he says now you guys
[1:52:47] just go
[1:52:49] [Music]
[1:52:50] and read it
[1:52:53] he said you're not better off
[1:52:56] than we were
[1:52:58] [Music]
[1:53:00] you know why
[1:53:02] without one drop of anointing
[1:53:04] one drop of the supernatural
[1:53:06] we can find a quote
[1:53:09] condemning
[1:53:10] you and speaking good of me
[1:53:14] building you up and putting them down
[1:53:19] but it's the same holy ghost saints
[1:53:22] same holy ghost and i'm going to explain
[1:53:24] the whole thing to you that you'll have
[1:53:26] a thought on your mind
[1:53:28] and i'll be thinking i ought to look

[1:54:50] heart so happy we didn't get the word
[1:54:52] poured into us to come to another
[1:54:54] conclusion we didn't get the word porn
[1:54:56] in us to come up with another idea of
[1:54:58] what it is to believe the message to
[1:55:00] live the message to do the message out
