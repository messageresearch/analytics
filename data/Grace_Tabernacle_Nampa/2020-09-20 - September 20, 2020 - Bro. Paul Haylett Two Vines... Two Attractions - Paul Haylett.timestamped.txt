[38:10] recently their little group their little
[38:12] family group up there so
[38:14] we want to just uh ask god's blessing
[38:16] upon their service
[38:18] today we want to welcome
[38:21] brother isaac's cousin sister elizabeth
[38:24] tallrud
[38:25] amen the beautiful young lady in the
[38:27] back for those of you don't know
[38:29] so she's just here kind of helping out
[38:32] with the family during the harvest time
[38:34] so
[38:34] god bless you and i pray you have a good
[38:36] visit here
[38:38] amongst the uncivilized amen
[38:41] and then we this morning miss our
[38:44] brother chris sister kristen
[38:46] but we get to welcome little ali rose
[38:49] grace
[38:50] amen and to the congregation a little
[38:53] six pound eleven and a half ounce uh my
[38:56] you know what that size uh now hope
[38:59] nobody misunderstands not offensive
[39:01] you know after uh little sammy was born
[39:04] and we have this little giant in our
[39:06] midst we go over there to hold
[39:08] little alley rose and it's like
[39:11] my what are we gonna do with this little
[39:14] kid
[39:15] but she's sure a cutie she's got just a
[39:17] beautiful smile and we thank the lord
[39:20] for
[39:20] a healthy baby healthy and easy delivery
[39:24] amen so just remember our sister kristen
[39:28] uh still you know just a little blood
[39:30] pressure issue
[39:31] coming but we believe it's overcome
[39:33] already conquered in the name of jesus
[39:35] christ
[39:36] amen so we just stand upon that amen
[39:40] well let's just stand for the reading of
[39:42] the word this morning
[39:43] i want to once again just speak to you
[39:45] on redemption's manifestation
[39:47] my brother and sister we have received
[39:51] the greatest gift
[39:55] come on we have received the greatest
[39:58] gift that has been given to mankind and
[40:02] that is
[40:02] jesus christ himself in our midst amen
[40:07] he said i'll be with you even in you and
[40:10] you know we as humans and i've done this
[40:12] many times and i ask you
[40:13] definitely forgive me if i've said
[40:16] something before and didn't follow
[40:17] through
[40:18] but as humans it's easy for us to say
[40:20] you know what i'll do this or all that
[40:23] and then you entirely forget about it
[40:25] it's something you really did mean
[40:27] but it slips away from you but our lord
[40:30] jesus
[40:31] he didn't forget a thing he made a
[40:33] promise to you
[40:34] he said i will keep that promise and he
[40:38] will amen now you know maybe this
[40:40] morning
[40:42] maybe you just uh humor me if you would
[40:44] call that and
[40:45] just repeat after me uh the phrase
[40:49] and i think it's good for us to confess
[40:50] from our lips
[40:52] my prayer makes a difference
[40:56] amen i believe we have to believe that
[40:59] or else pretty soon we'll just simply
[41:00] give up
[41:01] on our prayers amen but my prayer makes
[41:04] a difference the word of god said it
[41:06] would
[41:06] and i believe the word so i just confess
[41:09] to the world today
[41:11] my prayer makes a difference amen
[41:14] i want to speak to you this morning on
[41:16] the two vines
[41:18] and two attractions and as we'll look in
[41:21] the word of god today
[41:22] i trust it will be a blessing uh to you
[41:25] now i want to just jump over here real
[41:27] quick to
[41:28] just remind you a little bit of where
[41:30] we're at
[41:31] we're looking my brother and sister at
[41:33] this and it'll take us
[41:34] i think probably a year so we might be
[41:37] like brother donnie and have
[41:38] part 275
[41:42] but you look at this and realize my
[41:43] brother and sister
[41:45] in this pattern here we have to a lesser
[41:48] degree
[41:49] but we have two vines
[41:52] we have two attractions amen
[41:56] you'll notice as i've said before on
[41:58] both sides
[42:00] someone is sold out anybody sold out
[42:02] this morning
[42:03] amen so to be sold out amen
[42:06] but look the troubled ground if you
[42:08] would call it i i'm not so concerned as
[42:11] it were i mean we want to preach the
[42:13] gospel we don't know who is and who
[42:15] isn't
[42:15] but we're talking about those that are
[42:17] completely sold out i'm not so concerned
[42:19] about those who are sold out to satan
[42:21] amen my brother and sister and i'm not
[42:23] so concerned about those who are sold
[42:24] out to jesus christ
[42:26] where we really labor is to convince
[42:29] by the gospel right the preaching of the
[42:32] word
[42:33] that person that's in that middle ground
[42:35] in that troubled place
[42:36] where satan's really drawing them now it
[42:39] does
[42:40] not exempt us as being sold out
[42:44] from all the challenges of life
[42:47] are you with me you'll be sold out i'm
[42:50] i'm not gonna
[42:51] as long as there's breath in this body i
[42:53] will serve the lord
[42:54] that doesn't mean satan's not gonna come
[42:56] when you're down in the scripture
[42:58] as it says and the song says in the
[43:00] valley of despair
[43:01] satan's going to come and tell you see i
[43:03] told you so see i told you so
[43:05] but we have a response for that if we'll
[43:07] remember and that is it is written
[43:10] it is written i'm going to stick with
[43:11] the written word so we look at this and
[43:14] as we're looking at the two vines and
[43:16] the two attractions
[43:17] you'll find that there is always
[43:19] something that satan would make
[43:22] his world right satan's eden attractive
[43:26] he's got something whether it's a music
[43:28] you know i
[43:29] i find this ironic i'm thank the lord
[43:31] that i've overcome it
[43:33] but you know when i was a young man
[43:34] backslid from
[43:36] from you know being raised up in the
[43:37] message listening to the music that i
[43:39] listened to
[43:40] uh it was very attractive to me i was
[43:44] just walking in a store the other day
[43:45] and one of the songs from my youth it
[43:47] was what i used to call one of my
[43:49] favorite songs
[43:50] i was playing on the radio and you know
[43:53] instead of like getting into that
[43:55] something spoke to me and said look at
[43:58] that
[43:59] you used to be attracted to that
[44:04] but you see god comes and he breaks that
[44:06] attraction
[44:07] amen now bear with me okay this morning
[44:12] he doesn't break that attraction
[44:15] by telling you you're going to hell if
[44:17] you listen to that you're going to hell
[44:19] if you listen to that you're going to
[44:20] hell if you listen to that
[44:23] how he breaks that attraction is he
[44:24] places something
[44:26] more attractive in front of you
[44:31] you see you will be drawn to whatever is
[44:33] most attractive to you
[44:37] so god doesn't come by his word and say
[44:39] you know what i'm just going to condemn
[44:41] you over and over again until you
[44:42] quit that now what he does is he places
[44:45] something more attractive
[44:47] and what's down inside your soul
[44:49] responds
[44:51] to that attraction now let's just go in
[44:54] the word you know because sometimes
[44:55] things in life
[44:56] you know we have to get the right
[44:59] context to get the right answer
[45:02] amen romans the seventh chapter
[45:06] quite lengthy scripture we'll read a
[45:08] portion of it and allow you to be seated
[45:11] now here we're looking at paul speaking
[45:13] to the romans
[45:16] and i believe all of us relate to these
[45:18] scriptures here
[45:19] i relate to the context of it
[45:22] uh for it's very much enlightening to
[45:26] the battle you might say to the
[45:29] condition of humanity
[45:31] romans 7 and 9 for i was alive
[45:34] without the law once now let me just
[45:37] interject this
[45:39] this is a man who knows nothing about
[45:41] god
[45:45] come on you see
[45:48] without the presence of god in our life
[45:51] this world out here seems perfectly
[45:53] normal
[45:56] for i was alive once for i was alive
[46:00] without the law once
[46:01] but when the commandment came sin
[46:03] revived and i died
[46:05] and the commandment which was ordained
[46:07] to life
[46:09] i found to be unto death in other words
[46:11] he recognized he was lost
[46:13] for sin taking occasion by the
[46:15] commandment deceived me
[46:17] and by it slew me
[46:21] whereof the law is holy and the
[46:23] commandment holy and just and good
[46:26] was then that which is good made death
[46:28] unto me
[46:29] god forbid but sin that it might appear
[46:33] sin
[46:34] worketh death in me by that which is
[46:37] good
[46:37] that sin by the commandment might become
[46:41] sinful boy that's a paradoxical
[46:44] statement right there
[46:47] for we know that the law is spiritual
[46:49] and i am carnal
[46:50] sold under sin amen
[46:56] for that which i do i allow not
[47:00] for what i would that do i not
[47:04] but what i hate that do i if then i do
[47:08] that which i would not i consent unto
[47:11] the law that it is
[47:12] good now then it is no more i that do it
[47:15] but sin that dwelleth in me
[47:18] now this is a revelation right there in
[47:19] itself saints because the devil would
[47:22] try to tell you
[47:22] you you made a mistake you did something
[47:25] said something thought something
[47:27] that that's who you are but the apostle
[47:29] paul
[47:30] brings us a revelation he brings us a
[47:32] clarity here
[47:34] amen it's sin that dwelleth in me for i
[47:37] know that in me
[47:38] that is in my flesh dwelleth no good
[47:40] thing
[47:41] for to will is present with me but how
[47:44] to perform that which is good i find not
[47:47] for the good that i would i do not but
[47:50] the evil which i would not
[47:52] that i do now if i do that i would not
[47:55] it is no more i that do it but sin
[47:58] that dwelleth in me i find then a law
[48:01] that when i would do good
[48:03] evil is present with me for i delight in
[48:07] the law of god
[48:08] after the inward man can someone say
[48:11] amen to that
[48:13] but i see another law and my members
[48:15] warring
[48:16] against the law of my mind bringing me
[48:18] into captivity to the law of sin which
[48:20] is in my members
[48:22] o wretched man that i am who shall
[48:25] deliver me from the body of this death
[48:28] look that very next verse oh i find it
[48:31] powerful
[48:32] i thank god through jesus christ our
[48:36] lord
[48:36] so then with the mind i serve the law of
[48:39] god but with the flesh the law of sin
[48:41] you say how can you rejoice in that
[48:43] because my brother and sister
[48:45] as a prophet of god showed us very
[48:47] clearly god looks down into the heart
[48:49] remember those quotes we shared the
[48:51] other day he looks down into the heart
[48:53] it wasn't the man with the ability it
[48:56] was the man with the heart
[48:59] and that's what it was he said about
[49:01] david
[49:02] he's a man after my own heart
[49:05] hallelujah heavenly father we ask for
[49:07] blessings upon your word today
[49:09] ask lord that you would just come and
[49:11] speak to us we pray
[49:12] for those who are not able to be with us
[49:14] today lord we just ask you to touch them
[49:17] our sister sue with family lord brother
[49:20] chris and christian with their baby
[49:21] brother dave and diane traveling and
[49:23] those that i might have missed today
[49:25] lord just thinking about brother
[49:27] manasseh
[49:27] off to university and father ask you to
[49:30] be with him
[49:31] lord for your guiding hand upon each one
[49:33] in the name of jesus christ we
[49:35] ask amen you may be seated
[49:44] you know i think if we have a true
[49:46] revelation of these scriptures here that
[49:48] it goes a long ways in the
[49:50] in the battle of our mind amen that that
[49:53] will recognize
[49:54] that just because we make a mistake a
[49:57] situation
[49:58] in our life uh that that is not the real
[50:02] us amen now these are not to be used as
[50:04] an excuse this is not something like a
[50:07] gold mass go collect 200 but it's
[50:10] something my brother and sister that we
[50:11] can hold
[50:12] in our heart and recognize that when we
[50:15] come to a place that we
[50:16] come short or we stumble that that
[50:19] doesn't mean that we are not a son or
[50:21] daughter of god it does not mean that
[50:23] we have fallen from god's grace and i'm
[50:26] going to
[50:27] take this into a just a little short
[50:29] avenue for just a moment
[50:31] that uh we'll touch on again maybe later
[50:34] but i want to lay this groundwork this
[50:35] morning
[50:36] that you actually should be thankful for
[50:38] sin in your life
[50:41] now that seems like a paradox doesn't it
[50:43] why would brother paul say that
[50:45] because my brother and sister without
[50:47] sin in your life you would not
[50:49] recognize the enormity of god's grace
[50:52] and love
[50:52] for you amen if we were all just perfect
[50:55] little beings
[50:56] we would never comprehend what our lord
[50:58] jesus has done for us
[51:00] and so when we uh have uh you might say
[51:04] come in contact with the depravity of
[51:06] sin
[51:06] and recognize that we are lost my
[51:09] brother and sister
[51:10] then that gives us a very clear picture
[51:13] of the enormous
[51:14] incredible beautiful grace of god uh the
[51:17] blood shed at calvary for you and i
[51:19] amen actually said shed before the
[51:22] foundation of the world
[51:23] it gives us a very clear picture truly
[51:25] of what god has done for us
[51:27] now this is not for us to go out and be
[51:30] partakers of sin
[51:31] so that we might know a greater depth of
[51:34] god's grace
[51:34] i think most of us have faced enough sin
[51:37] to recognize that
[51:38] god's been very good to us amen now as
[51:41] we
[51:42] are taking our thought this morning i
[51:43] just want to uh just come and give you
[51:46] the definition
[51:47] of um the attraction amen
[51:50] attraction is something interesting or
[51:53] enjoyable that people want to visit see
[51:56] or do the act a process or power of
[51:59] attracting
[52:00] to offer something of interest something
[52:03] that attracts or is intended to attract
[52:06] people
[52:06] by appealing to their desires and tastes
[52:10] amen so you look at this and realize
[52:12] that in the world we are living in today
[52:15] the two vines
[52:16] have two diametrically opposed
[52:18] attractions to them
[52:19] but yet they're not really all that
[52:21] different my brother and sister
[52:23] you know uh mankind they like a good
[52:26] rallying speech you know kind of uh
[52:29] you can do this kind of a speech you
[52:31] know and not to speak ill of of these
[52:34] companies but
[52:35] you know companies like say amway and
[52:37] some of these others have really tapped
[52:38] into that
[52:39] where where you'll have these dynamic
[52:41] speakers a conference full of people
[52:44] and they basically walk out of those
[52:47] conferences
[52:48] and they believe they could sell amway
[52:50] to a lamppost
[52:51] amen they are so convinced that
[52:54] everybody needs amway
[52:55] so you see it's not just something that
[52:57] uh come to church
[52:58] it is actually something that reaches
[53:00] into the very nature or desire of
[53:02] mankind and
[53:04] and everybody wants to be encouraged
[53:06] everyone wants to be accomplished
[53:08] and so as we'll look at that today uh we
[53:11] look at these two sides these two vines
[53:13] these two attractions
[53:14] we'll see that uh sometimes you say well
[53:17] you know sometimes we go to church and
[53:19] it seems like the preacher doesn't
[53:20] preach
[53:21] much different than the service he
[53:23] preached last week
[53:24] but yet we walk away from the house of
[53:26] god uh revived we
[53:28] we walk away encouraged and feeling
[53:31] empowered
[53:32] because something inside of us is
[53:34] attracted to the word of god
[53:37] and so as the word comes forth we don't
[53:39] say hey i've heard that before
[53:41] we say amen amen because it is real and
[53:44] we can hear the word of god preached
[53:46] over and over again
[53:47] now my brother and sister there's some
[53:49] contrary spirits in the land that say
[53:51] well we've heard enough of the word what
[53:52] we need to do now is just worship
[53:54] my brother and sister that's not what
[53:56] the prophet of god told us amen the word
[53:58] of god has preeminence to the believer
[54:01] amen praise and worship are part of it
[54:04] we want to
[54:05] give a full measure but my brother and
[54:07] sister it's the word that we are after
[54:09] amen
[54:10] that's the priority and when we break
[54:12] this all down and realize as the prophet
[54:14] gives us a very clear picture
[54:16] that man i think uh knew but didn't
[54:18] really express so much
[54:19] remember this written word is just god
[54:22] on paper amen so when you are attracted
[54:25] to the preaching
[54:27] of the word you are actually attracted
[54:30] to god amen it's not just something that
[54:33] we read the bible
[54:34] talked a few minutes went home no you
[54:36] can honestly say
[54:38] we went to church we were in the
[54:40] presence of god
[54:42] amen and and then we went home amen now
[54:45] if you don't believe so we live in a
[54:46] different age although it's probably
[54:48] still kind of the same or at least seems
[54:50] the same to a younger generation
[54:52] but when sister jerry and i were
[54:53] courting i wrote her box full of letters
[54:56] amen
[54:57] and not just one here not just one there
[54:59] that was our principle way of
[55:00] communicating
[55:02] and the letters i received from her now
[55:05] i hope you don't think this is weird but
[55:06] take it back to what the prophet of god
[55:08] said about the word of god
[55:09] when she would write me a letter what
[55:11] she was expressing is
[55:13] i was reading between the lines
[55:14] especially when there was more and more
[55:16] commitment between us
[55:17] a reading between the lines that letter
[55:19] my brother and sister was her
[55:23] what it expressed was her
[55:27] amen and when we have the written word
[55:30] of god that's god expressing himself
[55:33] to us you know when the prophet of god
[55:35] said you need to read your bible
[55:38] every day you know what he was telling
[55:39] you you need to come over here and enter
[55:42] into the presence of your bridegroom
[55:43] every day because when you read that
[55:46] word anointed with the holy
[55:48] ghost that's god in your presence
[55:50] hallelujah thank you lord that we can
[55:52] have uh partakers kind of
[55:54] like our love letter amen so you look at
[55:57] this and realize what god is doing
[55:59] is he's coming down and there's these
[56:01] attractions in the world
[56:03] and this is why i've often preached that
[56:05] you can do almost anything on earth and
[56:07] still serve god a hundred percent
[56:09] you say well brother paul i i don't know
[56:12] some churches say we just can't do this
[56:13] and can't do that
[56:14] i'm sorry i'm just expressing my own
[56:16] personal feelings like that
[56:17] you want to fly the airplane fly it if
[56:20] you want to jump out of the airplane
[56:22] jump out of it
[56:22] you can do that and serve god amen but
[56:25] if we come and find that our attractions
[56:28] start to
[56:28] pull us away from the presence of god
[56:32] then we need to become cognizant of what
[56:34] our attraction
[56:35] is doing and so we move forward my
[56:38] brother and sister
[56:39] uh recognizing that these two spirits in
[56:42] the framework of the church
[56:44] they have this diametrically opposed but
[56:47] yet you would find that the
[56:48] characteristics or the similarities are
[56:50] incredible
[56:51] amen you'll find that people are devoted
[56:54] faithful
[56:55] they are the caught up in and give time
[56:58] money energy uh on both sides of this
[57:01] amen
[57:02] and so you'll see that these two spirits
[57:04] in the lives of god's people
[57:06] is the warfare that the prophet of god
[57:08] was talking about
[57:10] that satan is here trying to tug you one
[57:12] direction
[57:13] and the spirit of god now look at the
[57:15] difference that satan
[57:16] satan will manhandle you
[57:19] but god is a gentleman
[57:23] satan will trick you god will woo you
[57:27] now i tell you what no man would ever
[57:29] want to say well this is my beautiful
[57:30] wife i tricked her into marrying me
[57:33] what you want to be able to do is say
[57:35] you know what this beautiful lady right
[57:36] here i wooed her
[57:39] yeah i'm all rugged and got scars on my
[57:41] face and not too good to look at
[57:43] but i i wooed her i i i reached down
[57:46] something into her life and i touched a
[57:49] vein of something
[57:50] that that moved her to the place that
[57:52] she said you know
[57:53] he might not be much to look at right
[57:55] the scripture said our lord jesus wasn't
[57:57] much to look at
[57:58] right but do you look at that and say
[58:00] you know what he's the one
[58:02] that cares for me he's the one that it
[58:05] will will watch out for me and support
[58:07] me and and hold me close doesn't have to
[58:09] be something good to look at
[58:11] amen reminds me of a sister new years
[58:12] ago she had an apron
[58:14] she said don't marry for looks looks
[58:16] don't last cooking does
[58:19] and so you know my brother and sister
[58:20] there's a lot more to life you know than
[58:22] than just looks amen
[58:24] hallelujah oh if y'all don't mind me
[58:28] being a little humorous i actually used
[58:29] to be
[58:30] kind of pretty good looking too or at
[58:32] least i thought i was
[58:35] amen so these two spirits in the
[58:38] framework of the church
[58:40] amen the two spirits that are warring in
[58:42] the life
[58:43] of god's people my brother and sister
[58:45] paul uh
[58:47] was speaking here in the scripture and
[58:49] brother branham draws from this
[58:51] amen paul speaking of the greatest
[58:53] battle ever
[58:54] fought was this warfare that goes on
[58:57] when a
[58:57] man or a woman doing their best to serve
[59:00] god and other spirits coming
[59:02] i try to do good and i find that when i
[59:04] do good evil
[59:05] is present with me you think i'm trying
[59:08] to do god a service here i'm trying to
[59:10] serve him
[59:11] why can't we get rid of that my brother
[59:13] and sister that spirit is there
[59:15] he has access you know just like it was
[59:17] with job
[59:18] god said you can do anything you want to
[59:20] him but don't take his life
[59:21] now you talk about that my god just
[59:24] threw job out to the wolves no my
[59:26] brother and sister that's not what god's
[59:27] plan was
[59:28] god was so supremely confident in his
[59:32] relationship with job that he said you
[59:35] can do anything you want
[59:36] he won't quit oh i want to be that kind
[59:40] of man
[59:41] amen you say oh paul you might be asking
[59:43] for great trials or sickness or
[59:46] or things coming i don't care if god
[59:48] would express
[59:49] he had that kind of confidence in me i
[59:52] will stand hallelujah not got any give
[59:56] in me amen
[59:57] not me give in you hallelujah amen so
[1:00:00] you see this
[1:00:01] coming forth this greatest battle ever
[1:00:03] fought and certainly in the day that we
[1:00:05] live in my brother and sister
[1:00:06] you'll see things like gospel music amen
[1:00:09] they'll come along they use the name of
[1:00:11] jesus
[1:00:12] they they talk about that many of those
[1:00:14] songs oh if you listen
[1:00:15] they have zero content
[1:00:19] they're not there to to stir your soul
[1:00:22] you know repetitiously he loved me he
[1:00:24] loved me
[1:00:25] my brother and sister who's the he
[1:00:27] they're talking about
[1:00:28] amen for the word of god says if you
[1:00:30] love him you'll do his commandments
[1:00:32] and so it's not just that he loved you
[1:00:35] where's the love you're returning back
[1:00:37] not a one-sided relationship not a
[1:00:39] one-sided marriage or one-sided
[1:00:42] friendship but you see for a man and a
[1:00:44] woman to have a successful marriage or
[1:00:46] relationship
[1:00:47] they have to both give and they have to
[1:00:49] both love and return that love
[1:00:52] amen so it's not about what god done for
[1:00:54] us my brother and sister part of this
[1:00:56] equation
[1:00:57] as a prophet of god now excuse me this
[1:00:59] wasn't part of my thoughts today
[1:01:01] but as the prophet of god said he's one
[1:01:03] half i read you the quote here the other
[1:01:05] day
[1:01:06] he's one half this bride of christ makes
[1:01:09] up the other
[1:01:10] half they have to come together
[1:01:13] you can't just say well we're the bride
[1:01:14] of christ well where's your bridegroom i
[1:01:16] don't know and i don't care
[1:01:18] no you have to be joined to him
[1:01:22] to make the complete picture amen and so
[1:01:25] god
[1:01:25] moving in this now i want to just lay
[1:01:28] this little groundwork my brother and
[1:01:29] sister
[1:01:30] why it comes that we say well you know
[1:01:33] uh we're all message people we're all
[1:01:35] believers you know why do you preach
[1:01:37] about sin and why do you preach about
[1:01:39] this
[1:01:40] well my brother and sister because it's
[1:01:42] ever present it's a battle that we all
[1:01:44] must face because you see sin
[1:01:46] even comes down to just simple doubt is
[1:01:48] a sin
[1:01:49] amen now if sin is not recognized
[1:01:53] it is never resolved so if we just
[1:01:56] simply have fear
[1:01:58] in us fear of tomorrow or fear of a
[1:02:02] doctor's diagnosis or whatever it might
[1:02:04] be
[1:02:04] if we have fear in us and we decide that
[1:02:08] fear is perfectly normal
[1:02:10] then i can operate you know nervous in
[1:02:13] the night nervous in the day
[1:02:15] because of this diagnosis or these words
[1:02:17] my brother and sister
[1:02:18] people declare that's normal well i'm
[1:02:20] just human i talked to an individual
[1:02:22] just a few days ago
[1:02:24] well i feel that way but that's normal
[1:02:26] i'm a human
[1:02:27] well i'm sorry i'm going to take an
[1:02:28] entirely different position
[1:02:30] my prayer changes things amen my prayer
[1:02:33] makes a difference
[1:02:34] amen the prophet of god said whatever
[1:02:36] you confess
[1:02:37] is what is going to ultimately come upon
[1:02:39] you the bible says what you fear
[1:02:42] will come upon you amen so what do we do
[1:02:45] we come to the place we stand upon the
[1:02:46] word of god and i recognize
[1:02:48] i have a fear i shouldn't have god's my
[1:02:51] comforter he's my provider
[1:02:53] he's my refuge he's everything to me i
[1:02:56] have no reason to fear
[1:02:58] amen you realize the word of god god
[1:03:00] will never take you
[1:03:01] somewhere he won't keep you amen so you
[1:03:04] look at that
[1:03:06] that sin unrecognized is never resolved
[1:03:10] and satan's desire is to keep man that
[1:03:13] he would never know
[1:03:15] so if he thinks this world out here
[1:03:17] drinking
[1:03:19] dancing drugs
[1:03:23] is normal and no one ever testifies that
[1:03:26] it's not
[1:03:28] oh my
[1:03:31] you see my brother and sister you have
[1:03:33] to recognize your shortcoming
[1:03:35] to recognize the grace of god
[1:03:40] that's why as church we don't hide it
[1:03:42] all under the under the bench and say
[1:03:43] well we're all making a rapture we
[1:03:45] believe the message we believe the
[1:03:46] message we're all making a rapture
[1:03:48] praise the lord
[1:03:49] no we need to recognize our shortcoming
[1:03:52] but our shortcoming doesn't rule us
[1:03:55] amen the grace of god comes down and we
[1:03:58] lay it on the altar
[1:03:59] and we put it under the blood and it's
[1:04:01] finished and we can walk away with a
[1:04:03] liberty
[1:04:04] amen hallelujah
[1:04:09] now i want to just go into the sermon
[1:04:11] thirst
[1:04:13] brother brown says in this the age of
[1:04:14] high breeding hybriding
[1:04:16] and they even have got the churches
[1:04:17] today till they're hybrid
[1:04:19] that's right they get in here they just
[1:04:21] go to church it's a lodge instead of a
[1:04:24] church a church is a place where people
[1:04:26] come together and worship god
[1:04:28] in spirit and in truth so there is our
[1:04:31] worship
[1:04:32] and the word right there amen and today
[1:04:35] it's a lodge we go there and have a
[1:04:36] little time
[1:04:37] shake hands and fellowship some black
[1:04:39] coffee in the back of the building
[1:04:41] and go home till next week we've done
[1:04:44] our religious
[1:04:45] duty now it's a perverted age and satan
[1:04:48] is perverting these
[1:04:49] thirsts that god put in some church
[1:04:52] goers
[1:04:55] no you let's bring it down personal
[1:04:58] accountability
[1:04:59] he put that thirst in me he put that
[1:05:03] thirst
[1:05:03] in you amen don't go looking behind you
[1:05:07] well brother so-and-so could probably
[1:05:09] listen to this he needs a little more
[1:05:11] hallelujah maybe raise your fork instead
[1:05:13] of throwing it put it up so somebody
[1:05:15] does throw it over their shoulder you
[1:05:16] can catch it
[1:05:17] hallelujah well praise the lord
[1:05:21] amen the word of god tells us judgment
[1:05:22] comes before blessing so lord judge me
[1:05:25] because i want blessed
[1:05:26] amen so you look at this satan's
[1:05:30] perverting these thirsts that god put in
[1:05:31] you
[1:05:32] to thirst satan is perverting them now
[1:05:34] if you want to know the right
[1:05:36] now brother brown kind of is he's
[1:05:38] juggled right there i think you look at
[1:05:40] that he's kind of pausing he's going to
[1:05:41] say one thing he says another kind of
[1:05:43] he says you want to know the right
[1:05:45] perversion if you you women
[1:05:47] want to be pretty oh my we're going to
[1:05:50] put a little rubber on the road here
[1:05:51] this morning now how many of you sisters
[1:05:52] want to be pretty
[1:05:54] some of you never raised your hand oh my
[1:05:56] goodness
[1:05:58] you know what the opposite of pretty is
[1:06:00] maybe i should put it this way get a
[1:06:02] counterbalance
[1:06:03] answer out of you how many of you
[1:06:05] sisters want to be ugly
[1:06:08] none of you raised your hand so i'm
[1:06:09] assuming you just didn't lift your hand
[1:06:11] before
[1:06:13] and is that safe to say come on saints
[1:06:16] come on we're not dead we're alive here
[1:06:19] this morning
[1:06:20] amen now the women wants to be pretty
[1:06:24] take
[1:06:25] first timothy 2 9 that's the adorning
[1:06:28] themselves in modest apparel
[1:06:29] apparel with a christ-like spirit meek
[1:06:32] subject to their husbands boy this would
[1:06:34] just get some
[1:06:35] angry excuse me i'll cough so that will
[1:06:39] hide that
[1:06:40] for some of you and so forth that's the
[1:06:43] way that you should be adorned
[1:06:45] your life you live right now look my
[1:06:48] brother and sister often times people
[1:06:50] would think and i've encountered them
[1:06:52] that you start talking about a wife
[1:06:54] being subject to her husband
[1:06:56] and they feel like you're meddling but
[1:06:57] you know what i would say that every
[1:06:59] daughter of god
[1:07:01] would want to find that right balance
[1:07:03] amen and she would want her husband to
[1:07:05] find that right balance
[1:07:07] because the husband should be there
[1:07:09] lifting her up
[1:07:10] as it were now the prophet of god said
[1:07:12] every man should respect
[1:07:14] his wife he should honor her but he said
[1:07:16] when we come now i'm paraphrasing this
[1:07:18] when we come to the place we worship the
[1:07:20] woman
[1:07:21] then we are reflecting the spirit of the
[1:07:26] day
[1:07:28] yes sir reminds me of a brother one time
[1:07:33] was sharon with me he says you know
[1:07:35] brother he said we have a sister in our
[1:07:37] church
[1:07:38] and the brother was just speaking
[1:07:40] straight on us he says she
[1:07:42] is the ugliest woman i've ever seen in
[1:07:44] my life
[1:07:47] what's that brother the ugliest woman
[1:07:49] i've ever seen in my life
[1:07:51] she comes from hillbilly stalk she's got
[1:07:52] a great big hook nose her ears point
[1:07:54] straight out
[1:07:56] her teeth point every which direction
[1:07:58] and she's the most beautiful sister
[1:07:59] you've ever seen
[1:08:03] did you follow that you see the problem
[1:08:06] is we're looking to the natural when we
[1:08:08] needed to look to the spiritual
[1:08:10] because in the flesh she was just some
[1:08:12] hillbilly stalk you know
[1:08:14] rough looking girl amen but as a
[1:08:16] daughter of god she's the most
[1:08:18] beautiful sister now i want to ask you
[1:08:21] which one would you want to be the most
[1:08:23] beautiful woman on earth and go to hell
[1:08:25] or be that one with them snaggle teeth
[1:08:27] as the same brother said she could eat
[1:08:28] watermelon through a picket fence
[1:08:32] now my brother and sister the thing is
[1:08:33] she's a prayer warrior
[1:08:36] he was just making the point i'll never
[1:08:38] probably ever meet this sister but he's
[1:08:39] making a point
[1:08:40] that people look on the outside but the
[1:08:43] inside
[1:08:44] is really what a christian sees because
[1:08:47] there
[1:08:48] is the life of christ someone that is
[1:08:51] living is sold
[1:08:52] out is not concerned she's not gonna
[1:08:55] have to go get braces now if you got
[1:08:56] them no problem
[1:08:57] i'm not speaking on that but you don't
[1:08:59] have to go get braces and don't have to
[1:09:00] go get her ears pinned and she doesn't
[1:09:02] have to do this and doesn't have to do
[1:09:04] that
[1:09:04] so it look good my brother and sister
[1:09:06] she recognized by revelation
[1:09:08] that she could adorn herself with a
[1:09:11] christ-like spirit
[1:09:14] and that would then overpower anything
[1:09:17] of this flesh now remember god made her
[1:09:20] just like she was she's not an accident
[1:09:23] this
[1:09:24] church of god does not have to be i
[1:09:26] should go get this advertisement i just
[1:09:28] shared it with brother jason
[1:09:30] it come from some pin company how that
[1:09:32] we can come
[1:09:33] if we want to raise the prestige of our
[1:09:36] church
[1:09:36] we can give away their ink pens if we
[1:09:39] want to increase the attendance
[1:09:40] we can give ink pens as gifts to attract
[1:09:43] people to come to church
[1:09:44] if we want our image in the neighborhood
[1:09:47] to be gathered we could go from house to
[1:09:49] house giving away their ink pens
[1:09:53] hallelujah my brother and sister that's
[1:09:56] not what it's about
[1:09:57] we're to adorn herself and this is not
[1:09:59] for sisters only
[1:10:00] this is for us we are the bride of
[1:10:02] christ to adorn herself with a
[1:10:04] christ-like spirit amen
[1:10:06] you should that's the way you want to
[1:10:08] should be adorned
[1:10:09] your life you live amen because here it
[1:10:12] is
[1:10:12] the very nature of god is what the world
[1:10:15] will actually remember when it's all
[1:10:17] finished
[1:10:18] amen your neighbor is going to know you
[1:10:20] but what kind
[1:10:21] of a christian you were not by what kind
[1:10:24] of car you drove
[1:10:25] amen he perverts the true nature of god
[1:10:29] the true thirst
[1:10:30] of god of the body and soul by lust for
[1:10:33] sin
[1:10:33] sin a perversion now we find out a
[1:10:36] person today
[1:10:37] the way they've took that perversion
[1:10:40] thirst for god
[1:10:41] thirst for to be pretty and all these
[1:10:44] thirsts
[1:10:45] for for water they've turned into
[1:10:47] satisfying that with drinking
[1:10:49] the thirst for joy everybody wants to
[1:10:51] have joy can we say amen
[1:10:53] thirst for fellowship all these great
[1:10:56] thirsts that god has put into us that we
[1:10:58] might thirst
[1:10:59] after him god made you to thirst
[1:11:02] after him and we try to satisfy it with
[1:11:05] some
[1:11:06] other kind of thirst amen i want to
[1:11:08] liken this to you this morning to
[1:11:10] attractions right
[1:11:11] you go out here well we got to get the
[1:11:13] latest fashion we got to this we got to
[1:11:15] have the latest of this that and the
[1:11:16] other
[1:11:17] we've got to be seen with this or seen
[1:11:18] with that let the world know we have
[1:11:21] something my brother and sister that
[1:11:23] won't satisfy
[1:11:24] amen it's god in that place he didn't
[1:11:27] put it for us to satisfy something that
[1:11:30] we just have to have
[1:11:31] he wants us to have that same desire for
[1:11:35] him
[1:11:36] oh my god made you thirst after him we
[1:11:39] try to satisfy it with some other kind
[1:11:41] of thirst
[1:11:42] some other kind of a perversion of the
[1:11:44] correct thirst see how it's in the
[1:11:46] natural
[1:11:47] see how it's in the spiritual we think
[1:11:49] as long as we join
[1:11:50] church that settles that's all we have
[1:11:53] to do well that is absolutely wrong
[1:11:57] no god wants you to thirst for him and
[1:12:00] as a heart
[1:12:01] panteth for the water brook my soul
[1:12:04] thirsts after thee
[1:12:05] o god see see
[1:12:08] amen now listen i like this right here
[1:12:11] i i this kind of it's got a little humor
[1:12:14] i guess to me in it
[1:12:15] he said now if that deer was panting for
[1:12:17] the water brook
[1:12:19] what if somebody come along another
[1:12:22] buddy dear hey buddy
[1:12:26] what are you doing over there do you
[1:12:29] realize that
[1:12:30] you don't have to live this is okay
[1:12:34] right here
[1:12:35] buddy dear let me share a secret with
[1:12:37] you
[1:12:38] let's do some things together it was a
[1:12:41] buddy dear
[1:12:42] as a young married man that got me to go
[1:12:44] into a pool house
[1:12:46] on friday nights and shoot and pool to
[1:12:48] the wee hours of the morning
[1:12:50] a buddy deer yeah
[1:12:55] oh dear what a buddy
[1:12:58] yeah another buddy dear could come along
[1:13:02] and say
[1:13:03] say i'll tell you what i i could do
[1:13:06] i know where there is a mud hole down
[1:13:09] here
[1:13:10] come on well the deer wouldn't want that
[1:13:14] i wouldn't do any good hallelujah
[1:13:19] but that old buddy deer
[1:13:23] my i don't know if you guys really
[1:13:27] i should confess this much but there
[1:13:29] used to be a place with some
[1:13:30] pretty good pool tables in the city of
[1:13:32] caldwell called the watering hole
[1:13:38] but really what it was was a mud hole
[1:13:43] and a buddy deer said hey paul
[1:13:47] come shoot pool with us who's us
[1:13:51] well the rest of the young men in the
[1:13:54] church
[1:13:56] come on saints not one rose up and said
[1:13:59] whoa what are we doing
[1:14:01] we're christians we all
[1:14:05] snuggled up close to our buddy deer
[1:14:09] and went down to the watering hole
[1:14:14] ironic isn't it saints
[1:14:19] that the watering hole is really a mud
[1:14:22] hole
[1:14:25] full all kinds of pollywogs stomped into
[1:14:28] whatever well the deer wouldn't want
[1:14:31] that
[1:14:32] wouldn't do him any good and there's
[1:14:34] nothing can satisfy that
[1:14:36] thirst that's in the human being until
[1:14:38] god comes in
[1:14:40] oh can we say thank you lord this
[1:14:42] morning when that
[1:14:43] thirst is there and you're longing and
[1:14:46] it draws us in different directions the
[1:14:48] lust of the flesh and the lust and pride
[1:14:50] of life
[1:14:51] it draws us off into all kinds of things
[1:14:54] but when god comes in
[1:15:00] he must have it or die and no person has
[1:15:02] a right to try to hush or satisfy that
[1:15:04] holy thirst that's in him
[1:15:06] by the things of the world no sir it's
[1:15:09] ungodly
[1:15:10] to do so and if you thirst for god don't
[1:15:13] shake hands with the preacher
[1:15:14] and put your name on the book if you're
[1:15:16] thirsting for god
[1:15:18] there's only one thing to satisfy it
[1:15:20] that's meet god
[1:15:22] and if you're thirsting for god that's
[1:15:24] the only way you could meet him is to do
[1:15:26] that
[1:15:26] amen no substitute i don't care saints
[1:15:29] i'm going to be a little blunt
[1:15:31] i don't care that you identify
[1:15:32] completely with the message you've got
[1:15:34] the pictures on the wall
[1:15:35] you've got the right books you wear
[1:15:37] whatever if we are
[1:15:38] satisfying that thirst in us with
[1:15:42] any other thing then the word of god
[1:15:45] amen god himself right in the word amen
[1:15:48] any other substitution the prophet of
[1:15:51] god just said right here that's ungodly
[1:15:54] i don't believe any one of us here this
[1:15:55] morning would say well i'm going to be
[1:15:56] ungodly
[1:15:57] no but we will allow things to creep
[1:16:00] into our life
[1:16:01] that draw us away from the word of god
[1:16:04] and draw us away from what god
[1:16:06] has called us to now i want to just look
[1:16:08] here
[1:16:09] now you all a little quiet this morning
[1:16:11] that's okay that's fine
[1:16:13] amen but i just want to just want to lay
[1:16:15] this out to you
[1:16:16] because you see saints for us to truly
[1:16:18] rejoice
[1:16:19] in the word of god you've got to have
[1:16:21] liberty amen you've got to be broken
[1:16:23] free from the shackle
[1:16:25] as i've told you before there's no way
[1:16:27] you're going to go down there
[1:16:28] and put your ear on the post let them
[1:16:30] drive that all
[1:16:31] in your ear and be satisfied the rest of
[1:16:34] your life
[1:16:34] you were called to have the freedom the
[1:16:37] liberty of god
[1:16:38] to have the holy ghost in abundance amen
[1:16:41] not just to live a life
[1:16:42] that goes from service to service and
[1:16:44] weak to weak
[1:16:45] hoping that someday you'll find a
[1:16:47] deliverance that god has
[1:16:49] called us to a liberty he said who i
[1:16:52] have set free
[1:16:53] is partially free no he
[1:16:56] is free indeed amen don't let these
[1:17:00] little things creep in don't let these
[1:17:02] little
[1:17:02] foxes as it were come in and spoil your
[1:17:05] vine amen
[1:17:06] now brother branham says here in the
[1:17:07] message life he said a brother was
[1:17:09] testifying to me this morning
[1:17:11] he was called to the ministry when a
[1:17:13] little boy and then he fell
[1:17:15] and he said and he said uh but then he
[1:17:18] came back with more of a call to preach
[1:17:20] than ever before that's beautiful
[1:17:21] you see what it was when he became a
[1:17:24] christian he got in the wrong
[1:17:26] environment see and that environment
[1:17:28] influenced him see
[1:17:30] and you just keep holding around with
[1:17:32] that kind of
[1:17:33] environment you see it it influences you
[1:17:36] i hope you're reading between the lines
[1:17:38] of what i'm saying
[1:17:39] oh saints look i i just want to be
[1:17:41] straightforward with you
[1:17:43] you might not leave with a smile today
[1:17:44] but you'll leave with the word ringing
[1:17:46] in your ears
[1:17:47] amen you come to the point my brother
[1:17:49] and sister you've got to read between
[1:17:51] the lines sometimes you got to know what
[1:17:53] god's telling you
[1:17:54] and the environment that you're living
[1:17:55] in you say well i don't hang out in the
[1:17:57] world i don't hang out anywhere
[1:17:58] but if the environment you're hanging in
[1:18:00] is not bringing you to the cross
[1:18:02] not bringing you to calvary not bringing
[1:18:04] you back to the word of god
[1:18:07] undiluted i i don't know you know
[1:18:09] sometimes i just get on a bender and
[1:18:11] forgive me i'm just human
[1:18:12] but my brother and sister i just
[1:18:14] everything i read
[1:18:15] everything that's happening my dear wife
[1:18:17] sending me 300 quotes a day
[1:18:19] everything is just coming out and over
[1:18:21] and over again i keep hearing the
[1:18:22] prophet of god
[1:18:23] saying just one word don't let them come
[1:18:26] with one word
[1:18:27] different don't change one word don't
[1:18:29] believe one word different
[1:18:30] my brother and sister the bible he what
[1:18:32] is he doing he's reiterating it to us
[1:18:34] and maybe it needs to be reiterated more
[1:18:37] don't even allow don't listen to even
[1:18:39] just one
[1:18:40] word that's different amen because that
[1:18:43] influence oh i hope you're
[1:18:44] with me yes i'm preaching this prejudice
[1:18:47] amen
[1:18:48] a christian got in the wrong environment
[1:18:49] c environment influenced him
[1:18:51] see you just keep holding around with
[1:18:53] that kind of environment
[1:18:54] an environment that changing of one word
[1:18:57] is okay that's not a big deal it wasn't
[1:18:58] a big word
[1:18:59] uh come on that environment will
[1:19:01] influence you i hope you're reading
[1:19:03] between the lines of what i'm saying see
[1:19:05] it influences you in that environment
[1:19:13] okay i'm gonna say it
[1:19:16] depending on whether they like it or not
[1:19:18] my brother and sister
[1:19:20] this has been spoke to me man says
[1:19:22] something off the word of god someone
[1:19:24] defends and says oh don't worry about it
[1:19:26] it's just message myth
[1:19:31] i kid you not those very words
[1:19:35] ah no big deal message myth
[1:19:38] really it's off the word
[1:19:42] so what does it do i don't know if you
[1:19:44] caught it i want i want you to catch it
[1:19:46] it influences you in that environment
[1:19:50] oh oh i get it it's okay if we
[1:19:54] have some myths in the message
[1:19:58] it's okay that we have some things that
[1:20:00] that
[1:20:01] that this one told this one that told
[1:20:02] this one that this told was told this
[1:20:04] one told this one told this one and it's
[1:20:06] not right but look it goes way back
[1:20:09] it goes all the way back to when the
[1:20:10] prophet was still here so it must not be
[1:20:12] too
[1:20:14] no influences you in that environment
[1:20:18] that suddenly it's okay to speak
[1:20:20] something
[1:20:21] that doesn't line up with the word
[1:20:25] it's in that environment it influences
[1:20:27] you in that environment
[1:20:28] and first thing you know you become part
[1:20:31] of
[1:20:32] that environment and you go into it
[1:20:36] well i know we're not saying it right
[1:20:38] and we're not quoting it right and we
[1:20:40] have nothing to back it up
[1:20:41] in the message or in the scripture but
[1:20:43] you know
[1:20:46] here i am gonna sing a song to you that
[1:20:48] i shouldn't i heard it from a friend of
[1:20:51] a friend of a friend
[1:20:54] huh come on you guys have seen the
[1:20:57] rockwell painting
[1:20:58] where the man tells the woman i think it
[1:21:01] is starts off man tells the woman
[1:21:03] and it's several lines of a person
[1:21:05] telling persons telling person telling
[1:21:06] person telling person
[1:21:07] and the last square is the man back with
[1:21:10] the original person and he's angry
[1:21:12] because it's no longer the same story
[1:21:16] you think we should guard whatever
[1:21:18] influences we're around saints
[1:21:20] and you think we ought to take it you
[1:21:21] know i'm sorry you're an elder or you're
[1:21:23] this or you're
[1:21:24] that i respect you but what you're
[1:21:26] saying doesn't line up with the word
[1:21:29] amen it's not a myth it's not a myth my
[1:21:32] brother and sister it's false doctrine
[1:21:35] it's a false word right if one word
[1:21:38] will bring a curse upon you that's what
[1:21:40] this scripture says just one word will
[1:21:41] bring a curse upon you
[1:21:43] no my amen now you know here i am
[1:21:47] sounds like i'm beating a horse
[1:21:56] you'll find whatever the attraction is
[1:22:01] will be directly connected to an
[1:22:03] environment
[1:22:06] come on
[1:22:13] let me put it to you this way
[1:22:16] i won't name the brother's name but he
[1:22:20] says i refuse
[1:22:22] to quote the prophet
[1:22:27] well be patient
[1:22:32] he said if you need me to say brother
[1:22:34] branham said
[1:22:36] for you to believe what i'm saying
[1:22:41] you should know the message well enough
[1:22:44] to know i'm telling you the truth
[1:22:50] do you follow that you see
[1:22:53] for it to be quantified that we'll be
[1:22:55] able to say amen to it
[1:22:57] we've got to hear now brother branham
[1:22:58] said
[1:23:00] what about the word ringing true
[1:23:03] the word coming and the word in you
[1:23:06] sing amen to each other but when people
[1:23:10] come to a place
[1:23:11] unless they're sure brother branham said
[1:23:14] that
[1:23:15] they're not going to respond he said i'm
[1:23:18] sorry
[1:23:19] i'm not going to say brother branham
[1:23:20] said i'm going to preach this message to
[1:23:22] you
[1:23:23] and if you don't know the message well
[1:23:24] enough maybe take notes and figure out
[1:23:26] if i'm telling you the truth or not
[1:23:28] pretty pretty direct way he puts it my
[1:23:30] brother and sister because you see what
[1:23:32] it is
[1:23:33] we've come to a time and a place our
[1:23:35] attractions are
[1:23:36] everywhere but the word of god and we
[1:23:38] come to church and don't know if the
[1:23:40] preacher is telling the truth or not
[1:23:41] because we have no point of reference
[1:23:44] where is our attraction to study this
[1:23:46] message to read our
[1:23:48] bibles to be so engrossed into this that
[1:23:51] when the preachers preaching
[1:23:52] we can say hallelujah that's the word
[1:23:55] right there
[1:23:56] amen that's what he said to the romans
[1:23:58] that's what he said to the corinthians
[1:24:00] that's what he said in revelation my
[1:24:02] brother and sister but people have no
[1:24:04] point of reference
[1:24:05] because their attraction is to
[1:24:07] everything houses lands this that's and
[1:24:09] the others
[1:24:10] and that the word of god is a secondary
[1:24:12] thing and we're no different than the
[1:24:14] prophet of god was talking in that last
[1:24:16] quote
[1:24:16] about they just come to church
[1:24:20] come on look the day is coming saints
[1:24:23] you know i love you
[1:24:24] i want to see every one of you in the
[1:24:26] rapture i don't mean to sound harsh i
[1:24:28] don't mean to sound
[1:24:29] uh brutal i don't mean to sound grating
[1:24:31] but my brother and sister one day it'll
[1:24:32] be all over right
[1:24:34] amen he's not coming with a billboard
[1:24:35] announcement he's coming as a thief in
[1:24:37] the night
[1:24:38] amen and so it's time for us to just put
[1:24:41] everything in its right place
[1:24:43] and put these things off to the side put
[1:24:46] them i i'm
[1:24:46] no problem i own a boat okay but i don't
[1:24:50] let a boat dominate my life
[1:24:52] i'm not on a lake this morning or a
[1:24:53] river somewhere this morning in the boat
[1:24:55] justifying something else my brother and
[1:24:57] sister i enjoy the pleasure of tooling
[1:25:00] around on the water and burning
[1:25:01] expensive gasoline
[1:25:03] but you look at that when that thing
[1:25:05] moves into a place that i can't go to
[1:25:07] church because i have a boat
[1:25:09] i can't this because of that i can't
[1:25:11] this because of that
[1:25:12] you see mother and sister it's fine
[1:25:14] enjoy some of these natural pleasures of
[1:25:16] life
[1:25:17] but don't let them draw you from the
[1:25:19] presence of god
[1:25:21] amen you need you owe it to god
[1:25:24] oh i i guess i'm gonna get rough if
[1:25:27] you're watching youtube or you're
[1:25:28] watching television you ain't got time
[1:25:30] to
[1:25:30] uh watch your bi read your bible and and
[1:25:33] uh
[1:25:34] uh you know study the message my brother
[1:25:36] and sister then the devils deceived you
[1:25:39] amen
[1:25:40] you got to throw these things those are
[1:25:42] called distractions amen you've got to
[1:25:43] throw those things out
[1:25:45] because you see there comes a time and
[1:25:47] influence influences you in that
[1:25:49] environment
[1:25:50] and the foolish virgin right brother ram
[1:25:52] said you couldn't touch their life
[1:25:54] right couldn't touch their life
[1:25:57] but why didn't they have oil they lived
[1:26:00] the life
[1:26:01] come on saints they weren't drinking
[1:26:02] they weren't smoking they weren't
[1:26:04] slipping out at night and dancing
[1:26:06] but they didn't have the oil they come
[1:26:09] so
[1:26:10] far they came so far
[1:26:15] and then they hit a little blockade
[1:26:16] because they were too busy
[1:26:21] there's an influence that come in that
[1:26:23] environment
[1:26:25] come on am i being too hard this morning
[1:26:28] look i i want each one of you to stop
[1:26:31] and say okay lord
[1:26:32] am i giving sufficient time and i lift
[1:26:35] my hand
[1:26:36] i'm guilty i'm guilty just like anyone
[1:26:39] else but i i'm
[1:26:40] i'm not trying to promote myself but i'm
[1:26:42] gonna lift my hand and say lord forgive
[1:26:44] me
[1:26:44] amen that that i don't let this
[1:26:47] influence come
[1:26:48] and influence me in that environment
[1:26:50] where hey i'm a message believer i've
[1:26:51] been in the message a long time
[1:26:53] oh i'm a preacher you know so i'm going
[1:26:55] to be all right i've got a i've got a
[1:26:57] preacher's exemption it's here
[1:26:58] somewhere i don't know i mean i know a
[1:27:01] house one
[1:27:02] you know god's gonna give me some
[1:27:03] special uh dissessation of grace because
[1:27:06] i was a preacher
[1:27:08] no sir he said if you're gonna meet god
[1:27:11] that's the way you come you meet him
[1:27:14] amen
[1:27:15] oh let me put it back to you you're not
[1:27:17] going to stand before the throne one day
[1:27:19] and say but i'm a friend of a friend of
[1:27:21] a friend
[1:27:22] it won't work you've got to be one on
[1:27:25] one
[1:27:26] with him saints a reminder okay
[1:27:30] and the reason i preach this is because
[1:27:31] i actually love you so much it hurts
[1:27:33] i wake up in the middle of the night and
[1:27:34] i pray for all of you amen i pray and i
[1:27:37] pray and i pray and i
[1:27:38] you know i tell you that's a perfect
[1:27:40] thing don't go to a doctor for insomnia
[1:27:42] if any of you got insomnia amen don't go
[1:27:45] to a doctor for insomnia just pray
[1:27:48] the devil will say oh he's praying i'll
[1:27:49] let him sleep
[1:27:53] and if you don't sleep just think all
[1:27:55] the time you have to pray
[1:27:57] for the saints hallelujah it's a double
[1:27:59] blessing
[1:28:00] amen two-headed sword oh hallelujah
[1:28:04] okay my oh my worst time go
[1:28:08] you see my brother and sister what's
[1:28:10] happening is is matthew 24
[1:28:12] 28 declares to us wherever the carcass
[1:28:14] is
[1:28:15] there will the eagles be gathered
[1:28:17] together now my brother and sister this
[1:28:19] is not a
[1:28:19] vulture convention this is an eagle
[1:28:21] convention amen where the carcass is
[1:28:24] ultimately the eagles i hope this won't
[1:28:26] offend you but you see
[1:28:28] the vultures want to wait till the
[1:28:30] carcass is old enough
[1:28:32] that they can come and say well brother
[1:28:34] branham really didn't get this right
[1:28:36] you know because the carcass after a
[1:28:38] while is is getting stale
[1:28:40] you know we do this but is this a living
[1:28:42] word
[1:28:43] this this carcass that the bride of
[1:28:44] christ is feeding on is a living word
[1:28:46] it's not old it's not stale
[1:28:48] it's not a bygone era amen it's not a
[1:28:51] myth
[1:28:52] it's the truth amen so where the carcass
[1:28:55] is there you're going to find some
[1:28:56] eagles feeding
[1:28:57] and you look at that and realize just
[1:29:00] how beautiful it is
[1:29:01] that when the eagles can come together
[1:29:03] around the corners
[1:29:05] that they are there my brother and
[1:29:06] sister they're not arguing on the
[1:29:08] carcass
[1:29:10] this is some place where all of our
[1:29:11] divisions even in the message
[1:29:13] has a divisive spirit with it that
[1:29:16] they're arguing
[1:29:17] it's either my my argument saints i'll
[1:29:19] just tell you where i'm at i do argue on
[1:29:21] the word forgive me
[1:29:23] it's either correct or it's not
[1:29:26] there's my argument i don't care that
[1:29:28] this brother preached it or that brother
[1:29:30] preached it i don't care
[1:29:31] who's elevated or who's been demoted or
[1:29:34] whatever else it's either truth or it's
[1:29:35] not and if it's not true
[1:29:37] i'm not going to sit there and feed on
[1:29:39] it because that's not the carcass
[1:29:41] and you've never seen a bunch of eagles
[1:29:43] sitting there on the carcass my brother
[1:29:45] and sister
[1:29:45] debating they're eating
[1:29:52] now if you've ever watched a bunch of
[1:29:53] hyenas sister jerry and i had the
[1:29:55] privilege
[1:29:57] being in africa and watching hyenas
[1:29:59] behavior
[1:30:00] i'm telling you saints they argue about
[1:30:03] everything
[1:30:05] we went on a night ride on a bus a tour
[1:30:07] bus out of one of the posts there with
[1:30:08] brother gideon's sister kathy
[1:30:10] we're driving along there sister jerry's
[1:30:12] like oh i'm creeped out because
[1:30:14] you know the hyenas are actually a lot
[1:30:16] bigger than they look and these things
[1:30:18] are loping beside the bus that we're
[1:30:20] on and their ears are bobbing above the
[1:30:22] side right here and as they're running
[1:30:23] along they're running following the bus
[1:30:25] you know it's just something to happen
[1:30:27] and they're running along and then all
[1:30:29] of a sudden there's no hyenas there
[1:30:30] because they're in the middle of the
[1:30:31] road back there
[1:30:35] then they get up buses left us
[1:30:40] next thing you know they're running
[1:30:41] beside the bus again
[1:30:43] and then they're gone and they're in the
[1:30:45] middle of the road
[1:30:48] well i'm headed to the rapture
[1:30:52] i gotta catch up come on come on
[1:30:55] come on saints get these divisive
[1:30:59] spirits out of the house oh god we're
[1:31:01] here to get to the carcass we're here to
[1:31:04] feed on that carcass we're here to say
[1:31:06] this carcass is good
[1:31:08] this is the word of god the word for our
[1:31:11] generation
[1:31:12] the word for our day we're not here to
[1:31:15] fight over it we're here to eat it
[1:31:17] right oh if we just spend more time
[1:31:20] eating it and less time fighting over it
[1:31:22] hallelujah and those natural hyenas were
[1:31:26] still really creepy because they are
[1:31:29] well they just are
[1:31:32] now look i want to close out with this
[1:31:33] little thought here
[1:31:35] i got way more notes my goodness
[1:31:38] ah question answers brother brown says
[1:31:42] this
[1:31:42] he got in the prayer line and i was
[1:31:44] praying for him and i said
[1:31:45] do you believe chief and he said that's
[1:31:47] right and i said well
[1:31:48] you believe that god will heal you he
[1:31:50] said that's right
[1:31:52] i said you'd be a good boy he said
[1:31:53] that's right i met him about a week
[1:31:55] later brother fred sofman i believe was
[1:31:57] there it was when they
[1:31:58] when the tet meeting was going on it was
[1:32:00] phoenix and i met him a little later
[1:32:03] on in the week and i said are you doing
[1:32:04] all right chief that's right
[1:32:06] come to find out i talked to what's that
[1:32:08] missionary's name up there
[1:32:09] that old man with a white mustache up
[1:32:12] there now see
[1:32:14] if his wife had been there she could
[1:32:15] answer that question
[1:32:17] because i found out that anything i
[1:32:18] haven't figured out my wife remembers
[1:32:20] phone numbers
[1:32:21] people's names you know what i'm talking
[1:32:23] about brothers amen you talk about god
[1:32:25] blessing you
[1:32:27] hallelujah other people have to carry a
[1:32:28] smartphone
[1:32:30] amen come to find out the missionary's
[1:32:32] name old man white mustache up there
[1:32:34] with to the apaches
[1:32:35] i can't think of his name oh fine old
[1:32:37] fellow his wife was healed of cancer you
[1:32:39] know he said brother brown
[1:32:40] that's all he said i taught him to say
[1:32:42] me sick that's the only thing he could
[1:32:44] say
[1:32:44] that's right so that's about it you see
[1:32:47] that's right
[1:32:48] me sick i'll tell you what saints i'm
[1:32:50] gonna just throw this in here right now
[1:32:52] it'd probably be good if some of us
[1:32:53] believers would be able to say you know
[1:32:56] what me sick
[1:32:58] that's right me sick be able just to
[1:33:00] admit there's something in my life
[1:33:01] there's something bothering me something
[1:33:03] i've been dragging along i've got all
[1:33:05] this baggage me sick
[1:33:11] that was a very muted response
[1:33:15] somebody told me had one time was
[1:33:17] converted received the holy ghost and
[1:33:18] said to him how are you getting along he
[1:33:20] said pretty good
[1:33:21] pretty bad
[1:33:25] i know some believers like this how you
[1:33:28] doing brother
[1:33:30] i guess all right well maybe not
[1:33:39] how do you mean pretty bad pretty good
[1:33:42] he said well
[1:33:44] since me received the holy ghost right
[1:33:45] here good positive confession
[1:33:49] there's been two dogs in me one of them
[1:33:52] a black dog and one of them a white dog
[1:33:57] they can't hardly gallop beside the bus
[1:33:59] without stopping and fighting in the
[1:34:02] street
[1:34:04] they argue all the time they growl and
[1:34:07] fight at one another and said the white
[1:34:09] dog wants me to do good and the black
[1:34:11] duck wants me to do bad
[1:34:13] said well chief which one of them wins
[1:34:15] the fight
[1:34:19] come on saints i don't care how long
[1:34:21] you've been in this message
[1:34:23] what life you live you could be living a
[1:34:24] perfect life
[1:34:26] you have to admit we face this struggle
[1:34:29] right here
[1:34:35] that depends on which one chief feeds
[1:34:38] the most
[1:34:40] so i think that's a good answer here see
[1:34:43] there just depends on the warring of the
[1:34:45] body that's in you it depends on which
[1:34:47] one you
[1:34:48] cater to which nature you cater to
[1:34:51] the carnal nature after the things of
[1:34:53] the world or the spiritual nature after
[1:34:56] the things of god
[1:34:58] that does it amen
[1:35:01] can every son of god be so anointed
[1:35:04] till he can do miracles signs and
[1:35:07] wonders is this the next question
[1:35:09] i'm going to come back to that other
[1:35:11] quote we'll talk about that in a minute
[1:35:13] the very next i i thought they were just
[1:35:16] ordained of god to connect right
[1:35:17] together
[1:35:18] can every son of god be so anointed
[1:35:20] until he can do miracles signs and
[1:35:22] wonders
[1:35:22] or is this just is this at the
[1:35:24] directions of the holy ghost
[1:35:27] yes it is at the directions of the holy
[1:35:29] ghost
[1:35:31] if you're a son of god or a daughter of
[1:35:33] god
[1:35:34] whatever you are when you have received
[1:35:36] the holy spirit
[1:35:37] then the holy spirit directs you to do
[1:35:40] things
[1:35:42] hallelujah now i'm just going to deviate
[1:35:44] back around here make a nice little
[1:35:46] u-turn
[1:35:47] my brother and sister the struggle we
[1:35:49] have in life wait let me just stop
[1:35:51] it's not you it's people like you it's
[1:35:54] people like me
[1:35:55] that they come down to a place the other
[1:35:56] day i just got faced against a little
[1:35:58] thing the other day
[1:36:00] that just reminds you how feeble the
[1:36:02] mind could be
[1:36:03] a little situation that we're in some
[1:36:05] business and and my brother and sister i
[1:36:07] don't mean to make a deal out of it but
[1:36:08] i'm talking you know we're talking
[1:36:10] about not little business not five
[1:36:11] dollars we're talking about thousands of
[1:36:13] dollars
[1:36:14] and you know the other day i could have
[1:36:16] just done a certain little thing
[1:36:17] would have made me several thousand
[1:36:19] dollars but you know
[1:36:20] in the flash you go well you know
[1:36:24] this was this and that was like this and
[1:36:26] so that would be perfectly acceptable
[1:36:28] but another voice comes and says
[1:36:31] would you trade eternal life
[1:36:35] for five thousand dollars
[1:36:39] and the answer is of course not
[1:36:44] now i might be the only one here that
[1:36:46] faces those kind of things
[1:36:49] but i rather doubt it
[1:36:55] what would we trade eternal life for
[1:37:00] i hope the answer is nothing
[1:37:04] take this whole world but
[1:37:08] give me jesus you see it becomes a
[1:37:11] cornerstone of our life
[1:37:13] that we cannot get away from that and
[1:37:15] you say well brother paul what do you
[1:37:17] mean we can't get away from that
[1:37:18] the holy ghost that is in you will not
[1:37:22] let you leave the word the prophet of
[1:37:25] god says the holy spirit
[1:37:27] would never take you away from the word
[1:37:31] so when we can confess today i've got
[1:37:33] the holy ghost thank you lord
[1:37:35] have some confidence but when that voice
[1:37:38] speaks
[1:37:38] you've got to listen you can't say well
[1:37:41] i deserve this
[1:37:42] i did this and this for them and never
[1:37:44] got paid it would be perfectly fine
[1:37:47] and another voice says what would you
[1:37:50] trade
[1:37:52] nothing i have my answer
[1:37:56] nothing amen you see because the holy
[1:38:00] spirit
[1:38:01] is going to direct us to do the word
[1:38:05] bring us oh my
[1:38:09] you know what i've run out of time you
[1:38:11] realize every one of these sermons i've
[1:38:13] preached on this thing right here i just
[1:38:14] have to drag it forward because there's
[1:38:16] just not enough time
[1:38:17] i want to leave you just the slightest
[1:38:19] hint of
[1:38:21] where we would be going down the road
[1:38:25] and that will be go study in your bible
[1:38:29] genesis 13 and you'll see right there
[1:38:33] that this is the time when
[1:38:37] abram
[1:38:41] lot or family
[1:38:44] but they're bickering
[1:38:48] there's a struggle going on
[1:38:52] there's two dogs at war
[1:38:57] now neither one you go back and study
[1:39:00] the scripture go back and study history
[1:39:02] neither one was really wrong
[1:39:07] but one was more right than the other
[1:39:10] now you say why do you say that brother
[1:39:12] paul because none of us can stand before
[1:39:15] god in our own righteousness
[1:39:18] we have things that we're doing right
[1:39:20] but we still have those things
[1:39:22] that we do that aren't right
[1:39:26] but you'll find as it comes down it
[1:39:28] comes into a whole time of decision
[1:39:31] and we'll see of this
[1:39:35] anointing my brother and sister if we
[1:39:37] put it that way
[1:39:38] this atmosphere this attraction as we
[1:39:41] look in genesis 13
[1:39:43] amen you're going to see that given an
[1:39:46] opportunity
[1:39:50] i want you to see this now given the
[1:39:52] opportunity
[1:39:55] everyone says you know what you choose
[1:39:58] lot you choose abram didn't say you go
[1:40:00] down there
[1:40:01] i want you to catch this he didn't say
[1:40:04] you go down there in the plains
[1:40:07] you go down there to sodom and gomorrah
[1:40:10] and do the best you can do he gave lot
[1:40:13] the opportunity you choose
[1:40:19] now do you see this you might call it
[1:40:21] the law of attraction
[1:40:22] which is more of a theory than a real
[1:40:23] law
[1:40:26] lot got over there looking down off the
[1:40:28] plains of mamrie
[1:40:31] and they look back and here's a land
[1:40:34] that just goes forever and ever
[1:40:36] there's nothing out there and he looks
[1:40:39] down here
[1:40:41] and he says wow there's rivers there's
[1:40:44] planes
[1:40:45] there's people there's this there's that
[1:40:48] there's the city
[1:40:53] i'm not making fun i find it interesting
[1:40:56] i do joke about it
[1:40:58] sister jerry insists maybe some of the
[1:41:00] rest of you would be advocates of this
[1:41:03] sister jerry insists that you can take
[1:41:05] something
[1:41:07] apple orange candy bar
[1:41:10] t-bone steak and you can hold it
[1:41:13] in front of you and close your eyes
[1:41:23] keep on stake
[1:41:26] it's good
[1:41:30] other things
[1:41:32] [Music]
[1:41:33] feels like it's pushing me away now she
[1:41:36] only just
[1:41:37] does that trying to make a point with me
[1:41:40] you shouldn't eat that
[1:41:41] hold that out there and see what your
[1:41:42] body tells you
[1:41:44] well i'll tell you what my body just
[1:41:48] told me
[1:41:49] that hershey bar tasted good
[1:41:57] but here's a lot looking down
[1:42:00] on the plains and sodom
[1:42:05] forgive me saints i i don't mean to just
[1:42:07] make mockery i just
[1:42:08] want you to catch it lot was looking
[1:42:11] down on the planes
[1:42:13] and it just pulled him
[1:42:17] the attraction was so great
[1:42:21] right
[1:42:25] when you read some of the commentary of
[1:42:26] men like spurgeon and stuff
[1:42:29] you'll find that lot thought he could go
[1:42:33] down
[1:42:33] to sodom and live
[1:42:36] an overcoming life in sodom
[1:42:42] but by revelation abram abraham as i
[1:42:45] like to put it because he was always
[1:42:47] abraham
[1:42:47] amen he received a name change but he
[1:42:49] was always abraham
[1:42:51] abraham you know what i don't know let's
[1:42:54] speculate now
[1:42:55] seriously let's speculate for a moment
[1:42:57] here
[1:42:59] i think personally abraham knew
[1:43:03] where lot was going that's why he could
[1:43:07] offer that to him
[1:43:09] you pick because you see
[1:43:12] the track record of the attraction
[1:43:18] and they're fighting abraham sends his
[1:43:21] people out they dig a water hole
[1:43:23] lot comes along and says we're family
[1:43:26] wear this i have just much right to this
[1:43:27] water hole
[1:43:28] you do fighting
[1:43:31] constantly now i'm going to stop right
[1:43:33] there one for the sake of time
[1:43:36] two i want you to study that if you
[1:43:38] would find time
[1:43:39] revelation 13 revelations i mean
[1:43:42] revelation 13 genesis 13
[1:43:44] genesis 19 my brother and sister you're
[1:43:47] going to see there
[1:43:48] that there's something about that that
[1:43:50] drew him there
[1:43:53] and i'll just give you this much the
[1:43:55] prophet of god says these things happen
[1:43:58] because the word of god has to be
[1:44:00] fulfilled
[1:44:03] has to be not might be but has to be
[1:44:06] fulfilled
[1:44:08] you know what's drawing the bride of
[1:44:09] christ to the word
[1:44:11] prophecy that must be fulfilled amen
[1:44:15] you know the scripture says no man has
[1:44:17] sought god but god has sought man
[1:44:19] amen when you see this call this hunger
[1:44:22] in your life
[1:44:23] just stop don't fight against these
[1:44:25] things just stop and say lord i trust
[1:44:28] you to lead me
[1:44:29] i trust your guidance lord and i'm
[1:44:32] asking you to just show me
[1:44:34] with clarity give me revelation
[1:44:36] illumination lord that i can just walk
[1:44:38] into it
[1:44:39] because you see my brother and sister
[1:44:40] let me just close with this sister emma
[1:44:42] if you'll come
[1:44:43] my brother and sister let's not be so
[1:44:46] spiritual and fool
[1:44:47] ourselves there's things out here in
[1:44:50] this world
[1:44:51] we find attractive there's things in the
[1:44:55] age that we live
[1:44:56] in look i'll just be honest with you
[1:44:59] you drive down the road now we all have
[1:45:01] our little weaknesses
[1:45:02] you drive down the road i see some
[1:45:04] really nice shiny
[1:45:06] duramax pickup driving by with the right
[1:45:08] rims it's the right
[1:45:10] color got the right things on it and i
[1:45:12] look at that and i think
[1:45:13] wow what a nice pickup
[1:45:17] what tops that is when a cherry red or
[1:45:20] bright little corvette drive spot
[1:45:23] and i'm like jerry's like don't forget
[1:45:26] you are driving
[1:45:30] sorry i just i just find them beautiful
[1:45:32] i find them attractive
[1:45:36] but you see if my soul is worth ten
[1:45:39] thousand worlds and yours is worth ten
[1:45:41] thousand worlds what is something like
[1:45:45] that
[1:45:46] compared to our salvation
[1:45:50] now i'll tell you saints there's been
[1:45:52] many a time i've
[1:45:54] found a good buy on a corvette and i
[1:45:56] thought ought to buy this thing this is
[1:45:58] a killer deal
[1:46:00] but a voice spoke to me and said sure
[1:46:04] paul
[1:46:05] drive up to church
[1:46:07] [Music]
[1:46:10] drive up to church and get out of
[1:46:12] something like that
[1:46:14] when there's saints that are labor and
[1:46:16] struggle and just get by and just
[1:46:18] oh you know just go ahead or you know
[1:46:21] what's worse than that
[1:46:22] you know the preacher who at least
[1:46:23] drives up to church in his corvette has
[1:46:25] enough courage
[1:46:26] to show you what he's done what's worse
[1:46:29] is the impulse
[1:46:31] to hide it now i'm not talking about the
[1:46:34] preacher anymore
[1:46:36] i'm talking about every one of us the
[1:46:39] impulse
[1:46:41] i can hide it i'm sorry the word of god
[1:46:44] says whatever we've done
[1:46:46] in secret god will make open
[1:46:50] live a transparent life saints amen
[1:46:53] when the attraction of this world rises
[1:46:56] up
[1:46:57] just remember greater is he that is in
[1:47:00] you
[1:47:01] that is he that is in this world amen
[1:47:04] imagine all that nice shiny aluminum
[1:47:06] all that nice shiny steel all that
[1:47:08] chrome will turn into elements and go
[1:47:10] right back to the earth again one day
[1:47:12] it's not worth our soul amen the
[1:47:14] attraction my brother and sister
[1:47:16] now the vine of god the word of god
[1:47:21] will always draw you to the things of
[1:47:24] god
[1:47:25] amen oh i pray this morning you know i
[1:47:28] hate to say it this way but
[1:47:30] i never even got to the good stuff
[1:47:34] but you know the story about chief was
[1:47:37] in my sermon about four weeks ago and i
[1:47:38] never got to him till now so
[1:47:40] we've got a ways to go but i want you to
[1:47:43] understand saints
[1:47:45] we're in a warfare
[1:47:46] [Music]
[1:47:48] just allow yourself
[1:47:52] to have the liberty to be drawn
[1:47:55] to the things of god put god's work
[1:47:59] first and he says
[1:48:03] i'll give you everything else seek ye
[1:48:05] first the kingdom
[1:48:06] and all you know he never said what all
[1:48:09] was
[1:48:10] but i believe you know if you wanted a
[1:48:12] cabin in the mountains
[1:48:14] i believe that might fall into the all
[1:48:16] you want to live in a nice house
[1:48:19] you want to drive a decent car you want
[1:48:21] to enjoy a few pleasures of life that
[1:48:23] that can fall in the all
[1:48:27] but just seek first the kingdom
[1:48:30] hallelujah
[1:48:31] because there's an old phrase and i'm
[1:48:33] closing now brother jay i don't really
[1:48:35] have any songs if you would have
[1:48:36] something for us
[1:48:38] amen my brother and sister if it's too
[1:48:42] good to be true
[1:48:44] it probably is
[1:48:48] but the word of god is true
[1:48:51] amen right in the
[1:48:54] very next thing i was going to go into
[1:48:56] the scripture says
[1:48:58] he's never seen his children begging
[1:49:00] bread
[1:49:03] just trust him amen recognize the spirit
[1:49:07] for the day
[1:49:08] stand on the word of god even nook
[1:49:10] saints even if it tears the height off
[1:49:12] of you
[1:49:14] young people even if you think brother
[1:49:16] paul is just kind of boring and
[1:49:18] redundant
[1:49:19] please i ask you in the name of jesus
[1:49:21] christ just give
[1:49:22] thought to the word of god and ask god
[1:49:24] to make it real to you
[1:49:25] because it is real you know i get
[1:49:28] redundant i'm sorry i i just realized
[1:49:30] told jerry the other day i think i'm
[1:49:32] getting old because
[1:49:33] you know it's like uh yeah you already
[1:49:35] told me that story
[1:49:36] okay did i no you already told me that
[1:49:39] one
[1:49:39] i'm getting old saints but look at this
[1:49:43] my brother and sister this word of god
[1:49:48] when we had the opportunity i say we
[1:49:50] meeting myself
[1:49:51] i was already broke away i had no
[1:49:53] connection to no church i was away from
[1:49:55] family
[1:49:56] i was doing what i wanted i had my own
[1:49:58] money my own life i might have even come
[1:50:00] to your house and slept on your floor or
[1:50:01] your couch if the door had been left
[1:50:03] open
[1:50:04] i just went wherever did whatever
[1:50:07] see this is real i was at that state the
[1:50:11] world would say he's at complete liberty
[1:50:13] he has freedom he has money he has time
[1:50:15] space all this to do what he wants
[1:50:18] but you see there was a tug
[1:50:21] there was a tug that couldn't be
[1:50:24] overcome
[1:50:26] and it kept tugging me and tugging me
[1:50:28] and tugging me
[1:50:30] and i found myself no longer happy i'm a
[1:50:32] married man
[1:50:33] i'm no longer happy going down to a pool
[1:50:36] room in the middle of night
[1:50:38] can i just share a little brief spot of
[1:50:39] that story i hadn't overcome that i was
[1:50:42] still interested then
