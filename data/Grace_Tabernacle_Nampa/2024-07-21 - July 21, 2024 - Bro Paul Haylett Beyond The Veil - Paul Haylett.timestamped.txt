[34:23] that all of you that speak Swahili to be
[34:26] able to interact she knows was just a
[34:28] little bit of English uh but um you know

[34:35] have to copy that and go over into
[34:37] Google translate and Google Translates
[34:41] like actually Jerry sister Jerry did
[34:43] that portion Google Translates like this
[34:46] is
[34:47] Swahili and we're like okay cuz you know

[34:53] anything from that but she's getting
[34:55] established here in boisey I I don't
[34:57] have more details than that

[35:58] have sister Alice home with us today

[36:35] a glimpse of her oh my okay well we'll
[36:39] postpone that part I just glanced back
[36:42] and I thought oh there she is but it
[36:44] might be that s sibling not to hurt your
[36:47] kids' feelings but that sibling uh
[36:51] resemblance um anyway okay well praise

[37:04] leading songs it just uh stirs my heart
[37:08] Amen to be able just to worship and and
[37:11] uh be able to just open up and and let
[37:14] the word amen through song or through
[37:17] the scripture uh touch our hearts I want
[37:20] to talk to you I've
[37:21] been I've been uh this has just been on
[37:24] my heart and my mind for quite some time
[37:28] now um you know uh
[37:37] uh you know the other day I guess just a
[37:40] moment of
[37:42] nostalgia I I went back and I was just
[37:44] listening to a little bit
[37:47] of um brother Gideon
[37:51] preaching there to the
[37:53] church little did we know that in just a
[37:56] few weeks of many of these sermons that
[37:58] he would be going
[38:02] home but he was preaching of something
[38:05] no doubt was so real so visual to him
[38:10] talking about the
[38:12] eagle all he's got to do is just hold
[38:14] his wings steady that's right and the
[38:18] wind the word underneath his wings is
[38:20] what carries him he's not out here just
[38:22] flapping his wings trying to make it but
[38:25] he knows that the power power that is in
[38:28] the
[38:30] wind will hold him will support him amen
[38:34] and he preached that and I thought Lord
[38:37] could it
[38:38] be that that was anointed upon
[38:43] him to preach those because it was his
[38:46] going
[38:47] home but yet even that was
[38:51] so he preached it for the benefit of the
[38:53] Bride amen amen we don't need to go out
[38:56] here and just beat our wings trying to
[38:59] make it through
[39:00] leoda we need to just trust God we need
[39:03] to just let him come and let him let the
[39:07] word that he spoke to us become so real
[39:11] to us that that we literally can just
[39:13] put our wings
[39:15] out and just say it's the word Beneath
[39:18] My Wings it's not me it's not what I can
[39:21] do it's not what I have have
[39:24] accomplished but it's simply our Lord
[39:28] Jesus I know this might sound a little
[39:30] strange but I I don't know I want to be
[39:33] ready at whatever time the Lord calls me
[39:35] and I've just been upon my heart so
[39:37] strong lately of what is Beyond the Veil
[39:41] that's
[39:42] right and it's just the thought has just
[39:44] been getting bigger and bigger and
[39:46] bigger
[39:47] amen and as we look at this there's so
[39:50] many parts of this that you can't just
[39:53] in one service or even probably two or
[39:57] three services touch upon this but to
[40:01] realize how through the scripture all
[40:05] through this scripture everything my
[40:07] brother and sister now don't
[40:08] misunderstand me we're not discounting
[40:10] anything in days gone by but everything
[40:13] in the scripture has come to a
[40:15] culmination
[40:17] now what was preached in the Old
[40:19] Testament in the temple what Jesus spoke
[40:23] the Mount of
[40:24] Olives what he spoke there at C
[40:27] Calvary every every drop of that is
[40:31] coming right out down into this day it's
[40:34] it's being concentrated down as it were
[40:36] and and when you take something and you
[40:39] concentrate it it holds every single
[40:42] value that it did in the hole is now in
[40:45] the concentrate and as the prophet
[40:47] preached to us he says you know is you
[40:49] just take one little drop of that ocean
[40:51] that's right that's all right there that
[40:54] the ocean contains and just that one
[40:56] little of
[40:58] Christ is all of Christ amen so don't
[41:02] look at yourself or let the devil kind
[41:04] of discourage you that maybe you're not
[41:06] this real spiritual person but just take
[41:09] the fact that you got that one drop of
[41:11] Christ you've got Christ amen amen and I
[41:14] I just uh I just uh looking at these
[41:18] things and and U I thought Lord I don't
[41:21] know but anyway just so strong I just
[41:24] felt led to start preaching about this
[41:27] and I want to speak a little bit today
[41:29] maybe just uh an opening of this thought
[41:32] for the future uh Beyond the Veil amen
[41:35] and uh uh I I will probably be taking
[41:39] this in a slightly different direction
[41:42] uh than than it would be because we want
[41:44] to just lay a real Firm Foundation what
[41:47] is in the natural is only a reflection
[41:50] of what was or is in the spiritual amen
[41:54] remember it was always the word first
[41:56] amen the prophet preaching in this day
[41:59] put the word first well that's because
[42:01] that was always the order of the
[42:03] universe is the word first amen let's
[42:08] turn our bibles if we would today
[42:10] Hebrews the 10th
[42:13] chapter and uh I tell you I had quite a
[42:17] morning I had a sermon almost ready just
[42:20] simply to push
[42:22] save and it
[42:24] disappeared and it never reappeared y
[42:28] and so my whole morning was this mad
[42:31] scramble I know Brother David would
[42:33] would be able to reflect this sometimes
[42:35] in a moment of inspiration you write
[42:37] something down if that goes away from
[42:40] you you have to get back to that
[42:42] inspiration to find that thought but the
[42:46] problem is in our human desperation that
[42:48] makes it pretty hard to get back in the
[42:50] spirit to find the thought and so I had
[42:53] this very hectic very hectic morning you
[42:56] might say but but uh you know all things
[42:59] work together for those who love the
[43:01] Lord so we're not here in desperation
[43:03] this morning even though I looked like
[43:04] it earlier but uh Hebrews the 10th
[43:07] chapter verse 15 through verse
[43:10] 23 whereof the Holy Ghost also is a
[43:13] witness to us is't that wonderful we're
[43:17] not we're not just having to look at
[43:19] Witnesses we can lay hands on but the
[43:21] holy spirit is coming down and being a
[43:26] witness to us
[43:29] amen this is a covenant that I will make
[43:31] with them after those days sayith the
[43:34] Lord I will put my laws into their
[43:36] hearts and in their minds will I write
[43:39] them and their sins and iniquities will
[43:42] I remember no more now where remission
[43:46] of these is there is no more offering
[43:49] for sin having therefore Brethren
[43:52] boldness to enter into the holiest by
[43:54] the blood of Jesus by a new and Living
[43:57] Way which he hath cons consecrated for
[44:01] us through the veil that is to say his
[44:05] flesh and after having a high priest
[44:08] over the house of God let us draw near
[44:11] with a true heart you see with anything
[44:15] less than a True Heart you'll never see
[44:18] it right so that's why we have to stop
[44:21] and make sure our attitude our spirit
[44:23] the atmosphere around us is conditioned
[44:27] to be able to approach the word and
[44:29] receive from the word what God is
[44:32] expressing out of the word did that make
[44:35] sense
[44:37] yes having our hearts sprinkled from
[44:40] Evil conscience and our bodies washed
[44:41] with pure
[44:43] water let us hold fast the profession of
[44:46] our faith without wavering for he is
[44:48] faithful that promised Heavenly Father
[44:51] we ask you to bless the word today bless
[44:53] the Saints father each one that's here
[44:55] in the house of God Lord Lord you have a
[44:58] portion for them and we ask you Lord
[45:01] just release the power in your word let
[45:03] us be here to receive it father in the
[45:06] name of Jesus Christ amen you may be
[45:11] seated now I find this to be a very
[45:14] inspiring scripture because as you read
[45:18] this you are not looking at something
[45:20] that is saying I hope this is or this
[45:23] might possibly be but as Paul is
[45:27] speaking to the Hebrews he's telling
[45:29] them the Holy Ghost is our witness and
[45:32] this Covenant is not going to be a
[45:35] covenant that's simply something printed
[45:37] on a page a scroll rolled up put on a
[45:39] shelf a book published set aside but
[45:42] this is going to be something that's
[45:43] into the heart or on the heart of Sons
[45:45] and Daughters of God and in that time my
[45:48] brother and sister it is uh this
[45:51] Covenant that he has made now we know
[45:53] that if God says it it has to come to
[45:56] pass can we say Amen to that not a not a
[45:59] question not a doubt in our mind that if
[46:01] God said I'm your healer that he is our
[46:05] healer amen if I'm your deliverer then
[46:08] we should be expecting to be delivered
[46:11] amen and as we look at these things
[46:13] we'll find that when he declares and we
[46:16] won't go into the side note here but
[46:18] when he declares I'm your Revelation
[46:21] amen then we should expect to have
[46:23] revelation we should expect to receive
[46:26] from the Lord amen those things that
[46:28] have been hidden Through the Ages but
[46:31] are made known in this day to you and I
[46:34] amen now if we have no expectation of
[46:37] Revelation then you might as well just
[46:39] take your pen go through your Bible and
[46:42] scratch the word revelation out
[46:44] everywhere you come acrost it because if
[46:46] you don't believe it it may as well be
[46:48] absent from you but as we stand here
[46:51] today believing that God has promised
[46:54] Revelation to us as Sons and Daughters
[46:56] of God then this revelation will come to
[46:59] us in the right season amen so you know
[47:02] I I think it's wonderful you know this
[47:05] might be a little hard for some people
[47:07] to uh to approach uh Verse 18 because um
[47:12] you know old teachings and old
[47:14] traditions can be a little bit hard to
[47:16] let go of because they're ingrained in
[47:18] us but I just want to focus for one
[47:20] moment on this there is no more offering
[47:24] for
[47:25] sin my brother and sister I don't care
[47:28] what you have or what you think you can
[47:30] bring there is no more offering for sin
[47:34] it is a settled question Jesus on
[47:37] Calvary said it is finished and if we
[47:40] believe the word we can this morning no
[47:42] matter what our circumstance a health
[47:44] condition a family condition a personal
[47:46] emotional or whatever condition we can
[47:49] say it is finished today amen and we
[47:52] don't have to look back hoping that we
[47:54] can live good enough or do good enough
[47:56] enough or approach it in the right way
[47:59] but to come and say Lord here I am I
[48:01] just simply as a song says I surrender
[48:04] all do we really know what I surrender
[48:06] all means uh I surrender all but no my
[48:10] brother and sister we got to come to the
[48:12] place we surrender all and as we look at
[48:15] this realizing that he has already made
[48:18] this way for us and he is uh uh uh
[48:22] telling us to draw near with a true
[48:25] heart and full Assurance of faith
[48:27] our hearts sprinkled from Evil
[48:29] conscience which would be as it would be
[48:31] evil thoughts or evil approach you know
[48:34] uh you know holding on to to things in
[48:36] life that we should let go of it's
[48:39] amazing I've experienced such in my life
[48:42] that you will be dealing with someone
[48:43] that is is uh Desiring uh deliverance
[48:46] and and they're Desiring to overcome and
[48:49] yet you they themselves will ultimately
[48:51] confess that I still hold a bitterness I
[48:54] still hold an anger I still hold
[48:56] something maybe against parents or a
[48:58] friend or this that or the other and and
[49:01] it's there that as long as that is
[49:03] present my brother and sister that
[49:05] totally takes every bit of power out of
[49:08] the promise the promise didn't go away
[49:10] you just have not tapped the power amen
[49:13] and so you come to a place you know
[49:15] that's why they put fuses in into all
[49:17] things electronic Etc you go and you you
[49:21] know it's like this doesn't work oh the
[49:23] fuse is blown you put another fuse in
[49:26] there it will blow it immediately amen
[49:28] it's not the new fuse is not going to
[49:31] fix the problem you can say oh I've had
[49:33] a new birth amen well that's not going
[49:37] to fix the problem if you have
[49:39] bitterness and anger and fear and all of
[49:42] these other things you can put as much
[49:43] and apply that as much as you want we
[49:45] had an experience just recently I don't
[49:48] know we haven't fixed the problem yet
[49:50] but you put a new fuse in there and you
[49:52] don't even have it shoved in there and
[49:55] it's gone and you could put as many
[49:57] fuses in there as you want that will not
[50:00] fix the problem what God wants is for us
[50:03] to look and say okay there's a reason
[50:06] that I'm not tapped into the power of
[50:08] the word there's a reason these promises
[50:10] of God are not coming to pass in my life
[50:12] maybe it's something that we have
[50:14] totally forgotten about in the past but
[50:16] we need to deal with it maybe it's
[50:18] something that down inside you know that
[50:21] that something even the mention of
[50:23] someone's name brings a little something
[50:25] to us and we think oh it's just that
[50:27] that was just from the past you need to
[50:29] deal with that cuz it'll blow the fuse
[50:31] every single time amen but when we'll
[50:34] come and say you know what there's a
[50:36] reason that I'm not tapping into the
[50:38] power of the word there's a reason these
[50:40] things aren't taking place in my life my
[50:43] family maybe even the church we can have
[50:45] that kind of influence amen and we need
[50:48] to go back and the scripture tells us to
[50:50] search our hearts amen that's not a
[50:53] casual overview my brother and sister
[50:55] but search
[50:57] the heart and you say well I I don't
[51:00] know I just can't bring myself to that
[51:02] well let me give you a natural thing
[51:04] when brother Jason sister Emmy moved
[51:05] here and we had the trailer loaded with
[51:08] their possessions and we come to the
[51:09] border and they saidy okay what's in
[51:12] this trailer and and it was like my
[51:14] friend's household his his life not his
[51:18] wife his life and uh and they said okay
[51:23] you need to go over here they stopped
[51:25] the big semis you need to go over here
[51:27] and you need to go through this machine
[51:30] now pull forward to the point that we
[51:32] tell you to and stop you get out of the
[51:34] machine put the keys on the dash you
[51:36] stand right there so we're there but the
[51:39] officer was a nice man and as they're
[51:41] starting this process uh he's like
[51:44] there's nothing living inside that
[51:45] trailer is there no pets no nothing no
[51:48] sir and he goes uh do do you know what's
[51:50] in there I said well I never packed the
[51:53] boxes I just packed the boxes amen so
[51:57] you know the man comes back to me and he
[51:59] says sir yes there is an image right
[52:03] over the wheels of this
[52:06] trailer what is in that what is that and
[52:09] what is in it I said well sir that's
[52:12] awesome I know the answer to that my
[52:14] friend when he went to welding school
[52:16] had to build a project at the end of his
[52:19] deal there that met the the the teacher
[52:21] deals and and that is a big steel
[52:24] lockable box that he buil built and and
[52:27] uh handcrafted it himself and it's
[52:29] beautiful and he says what's in it and I
[52:31] said well there's this this I started
[52:33] naming everything that we had set inside
[52:35] there there's hammers there's wrenches
[52:38] there's this he says there's nothing
[52:39] that you'd be willing to go to jail for
[52:41] is there and I said absolutely not and
[52:44] he goes good I believe you my brother
[52:47] and sister the reason I bring that up is
[52:49] I'm telling you if man can look inside
[52:51] of something that's packed wall toall
[52:53] almost to the ceiling and be able to
[52:55] isolate a single crescent wrench in the
[52:58] middle of a trailer how the Holy Spirit
[53:01] would come down and cause you and I to
[53:03] search our lives cause us to stop and
[53:06] say Lord what is it is hindering me what
[53:08] is keeping me from rising up into
[53:11] Heavenly places amen if man can devise
[53:14] that then what will the Holy Spirit do
[53:16] to you and I amen amen as we look at
[53:21] this you know as I said earlier I find
[53:24] it very inspiring it's uh a promise to
[53:27] us this is a promise my brother and
[53:29] sister that he's made a covenant to us
[53:32] this is not just casual talk
[53:34] conversation but this is a covenant that
[53:36] he made and and uh you know uh he says
[53:40] and I just want to remind you of this
[53:41] there sins and iniquities will I
[53:43] remember no more that ought to give us
[53:45] confidence in the house of God this
[53:47] morning if we've done what we are
[53:49] supposed to do and that is repent amen
[53:52] and then we'll come that God does not
[53:54] even bring up or remember are issues the
[53:57] things of our past our struggles and and
[53:59] I tell you if you've been stupid in your
[54:01] life pardon me for using that I'm I'm
[54:05] slowly being trained to not use several
[54:13] words if you're
[54:17] not what replaces
[54:21] stupid I've already said it
[54:24] amen you know what Satan desires he
[54:27] wants to take your boldness the word
[54:29] says to come boldly to the throne of God
[54:31] Satan wants to take your boldness if he
[54:35] can bring you to a place that you
[54:37] remember the little fuss now I know it
[54:39] won't be you people but it be people
[54:41] like you that get anointed to fight in
[54:43] the car on the way to church amen let me
[54:47] look real careful but look at this my
[54:49] brother and sister the reason Satan does
[54:52] things like that you can worship you can
[54:54] have a lovely atmosphere and you're
[54:56] going to the house of God and Satan does
[54:59] not want you to be able to worship
[55:01] boldly this morning so what does he do
[55:04] he fires a little Dart in there and it
[55:07] causes a little fuss to do we come in
[55:09] the house of God we won't even hardly
[55:11] sing because of the atmosphere that he
[55:14] uh placed upon us and so the boldness
[55:17] that we'd have to come upon the word of
[55:19] God is just totally erased but that if
[55:22] we'll remember right is not you it's not
[55:25] your brother your sister sister or your
[55:27] mother it is the devil amen because he
[55:30] wants to steal your boldness in the
[55:33] house of God today to take a halt of a
[55:36] promise to take a halt of the word and
[55:38] be able to stand there and say this will
[55:40] come to pass now people get all nervous
[55:43] when they hear people say thus sayeth
[55:45] the Lord but how about we just reward
[55:47] that a little bit so you'll be
[55:48] comfortable how about thus sayith the
[55:50] word amen my brother and sister That's
[55:54] what Satan wants he wants to take the B
[55:56] oldness of you confessing and trusting
[55:59] and stepping out on the word he wants to
[56:02] take that from you I'll tell you a timid
[56:04] Christian is not hardly a Christian amen
[56:08] oh that that might
[56:11] hurt the promise is right
[56:15] there promise is right there amen it's
[56:18] just right there that's right what's
[56:21] stopping you from possessing it that's
[56:24] it amen because you're afid to take that
[56:27] next step out now if I could relate a
[56:29] little something we missed all of you on
[56:31] the camping trip yes it was so terribly
[56:35] hot it was so
[56:37] scorching but it was cooler than
[56:41] here so all of you that didn't go
[56:43] camping cuz it was hot well you're lost
[56:47] amen cuz it was cooler than here in more
[56:50] than one way
[56:53] yeah but look at this we're out there
[56:58] we're
[56:58] kaying something new to me would have
[57:02] made a great video you know kayaks look
[57:04] like zigzag stitches to those of you who
[57:08] sew it all depends on which paddle is
[57:12] but we went off down the lake and and uh
[57:16] uh some of the young men in the church
[57:18] they went down there climbed up this
[57:19] tree that's hanging over the lake it
[57:21] looked to me like it Fallen the lake but
[57:23] it it was there and and uh you know they
[57:27] climbed way up there that rope was tied
[57:28] so far up there I don't know who is
[57:30] brave enough to climb up there but they
[57:33] Swang uh off that and flew way out there
[57:36] well sister Jerry and I were in The
[57:37] Kayaks and and we're watching and these
[57:40] young men come across and one of them
[57:42] climbs up there gets the Rope hurts
[57:44] himself because he didn't get the slack
[57:46] of the Rope out and it kind of rope
[57:48] burned him and whatnot and and he's
[57:50] there kind of recovering on the bank and
[57:52] Ne kid says I'm going to do it but he
[57:54] climbed a little ways up up he was just
[57:58] about that far short of being able to
[58:00] grab the
[58:01] crossbar just that
[58:03] close and they said go on up and he said
[58:06] I ain't going no
[58:08] further come on you're that close man
[58:11] and he's like I already slipped and
[58:14] almost fell once I ain't doing it so
[58:17] then instead of giving six in I hope you
[58:20] catch this instead of giving six Ines
[58:23] more effort to get the crossbar he
[58:26] climbed down the tree
[58:29] backwards and when he climbed off of the
[58:31] tree he was skinned on his arms his
[58:34] knees his legs and he was like that's
[58:37] too
[58:39] scary come on
[58:42] Christians just six more
[58:45] inches in other words just one more help
[58:48] me
[58:49] Lord just one more stepping out Lord I'm
[58:53] going to trust you amen
[58:57] but he reached a point he couldn't go no
[58:58] further this far from the
[59:02] crossbar the guy who belly flopped that
[59:05] was part of or yeah the the guy who well
[59:10] yeah I want to describe it it was quite
[59:13] amazing to see a quite chubby guy land
[59:16] on the water with arms and legs out and
[59:19] even as he hits the water you hear this
[59:20] giant
[59:23] OU but I tell you what he was a good
[59:28] Christian because he went right back
[59:30] even though it was painful he went right
[59:33] back and said I'm not going to
[59:36] quit
[59:37] now you have to take that place that
[59:40] good Christian however you want to place
[59:42] it I wasn't talking about him as a man
[59:46] amen because right after out comes some
[59:48] language that we won't repeat but you
[59:51] see if Satan can take your boldness if
[59:54] he can cause you to waver what's the
[59:55] scripture say that if a man is
[59:57] double-minded he's not just
[59:59] double-minded in one situation of his
[1:00:01] life but if a man is double-minded he
[1:00:04] becomes unstable in all of his ways and
[1:00:08] it might not happen instantly my brother
[1:00:10] and sister but when we come to the place
[1:00:12] we can't sell out and completely trust
[1:00:15] the Lord with our life with our
[1:00:18] circumstance with our every day if we
[1:00:22] come to the place that do that you'll
[1:00:24] find that the things we can't trust God
[1:00:26] for will actually grow not decrease and
[1:00:29] so as it is that when we become
[1:00:31] double-minded or unstable on the word of
[1:00:34] God that we'll find ourselves starting
[1:00:36] in a pattern of backing up upon the word
[1:00:38] there'll be more and more things that
[1:00:40] we'll have to question we can't really
[1:00:42] trust but what God is looking is for
[1:00:45] someone that will say you know what I
[1:00:47] can give one more effort Lord I can give
[1:00:50] one more day I can give one more bit of
[1:00:52] my very being of life I can give that to
[1:00:55] you Lord cuz I trust
[1:01:03] you Satan just wants you to
[1:01:06] waver do you realize if he can cause us
[1:01:08] to
[1:01:10] waver he can just sit back and watch the
[1:01:13] rest take place
[1:01:19] right we'll read a little bit of a quote
[1:01:21] here in a little bit if I get myself in
[1:01:23] gear amen remember the Holy Ghost ghost
[1:01:26] is a witness to us now you know have you
[1:01:30] ever been in a situation you thought you
[1:01:32] was friends with someone and a little
[1:01:33] something comes up and and that just
[1:01:35] breaks that Fellowship uh and and you
[1:01:38] you don't ever really figure it out you
[1:01:40] don't really know exactly what caused
[1:01:43] that to to take place but Satan's desire
[1:01:47] is to break our fellowship you see now
[1:01:49] if he's got us to the place we don't
[1:01:51] trust he's going to then bring us down
[1:01:54] to a place that are Fellowship Fades
[1:01:57] away that our fellowship is is going to
[1:02:01] falter and one day completely end and uh
[1:02:04] you know uh the word of God tells us
[1:02:08] that if we add one thing to the word of
[1:02:10] God or we subtract one thing it it uh is
[1:02:15] judgment to us but I tell you just look
[1:02:17] at it in this sense here that just one
[1:02:20] thing added or one thing
[1:02:22] subtracted uh it changes the whole
[1:02:25] relationship
[1:02:27] if you if you've ever been um this is
[1:02:29] something not to make emphasis of it has
[1:02:31] happened to me in my life people I
[1:02:33] thought were my friends and they lied to
[1:02:36] me you know it's really hard to trust
[1:02:38] them let's just think about it naturally
[1:02:40] for a moment if they lied to you and you
[1:02:43] realize that that was premeditated a
[1:02:46] blent and lie H you realize in the
[1:02:49] future you have a hard time ever
[1:02:52] trusting that
[1:02:54] person and maybe it will go so far if
[1:02:57] you're talking in the natural that that
[1:02:59] maybe before money things or issues like
[1:03:03] that and suddenly it's no longer hey
[1:03:06] trust me when they say the word trust me
[1:03:08] you don't know if they're sincere now or
[1:03:10] not and you don't know if you should or
[1:03:12] you shouldn't because something has
[1:03:15] affected you in such a fashion that that
[1:03:17] last little link that was in that chain
[1:03:20] right a Chain's only as strong as its
[1:03:22] weakest link and in that you no longer
[1:03:26] have the confidence to just step out and
[1:03:28] say yeah I'll trust you but you see my
[1:03:31] brother and sister that's what Satan's
[1:03:32] Desiring I have dealt so many times and
[1:03:35] just here recently in a conversation
[1:03:37] with an individual was there saying you
[1:03:40] know what I I thought I was delivered
[1:03:42] from this brother Paul I thought I was
[1:03:44] free from this and it's come back upon
[1:03:46] my life and now I can't trust
[1:03:50] myself now how is a young man like that
[1:03:53] ever going to step out into the word
[1:03:55] grab a promise and say this is my
[1:03:58] promise and Satan you can't Prime my
[1:04:00] fingers from this promise when he
[1:04:02] doesn't even trust
[1:04:04] himself I think we've all been there
[1:04:07] before we've done things we say well
[1:04:09] I'll never do that again and we do it
[1:04:14] yeah
[1:04:16] Hallelujah examine
[1:04:19] yourself so as you look at this this
[1:04:22] little things added or subtracted
[1:04:24] changes the relationship now in the
[1:04:27] quote lean not un thine own
[1:04:29] understanding amen is it on there
[1:04:32] brother
[1:04:33] Gideon
[1:04:34] um brother brandham says right here i i
[1:04:37] cherry pick this for people that you
[1:04:39] know whatever if if that bothers you you
[1:04:41] know where to find
[1:04:43] it
[1:04:45] yes one word of God
[1:04:48] misplaced or misconstrued that's now I
[1:04:52] want you to understand the word
[1:04:54] misconstrued what do they call that when
[1:04:56] you have a similar
[1:04:57] word misunderstood misconstrued what do
[1:05:01] they call
[1:05:02] those synonyms yes educated people know
[1:05:07] what that word
[1:05:09] is one word put out of
[1:05:12] place or
[1:05:16] misunderstood you see it doesn't even
[1:05:18] have to be intentional my brother and
[1:05:20] sister this is why God wants you and I
[1:05:23] to search the scripture because if we
[1:05:25] have one reference right here and we run
[1:05:27] with that one reference but it's a
[1:05:29] little bit out of place we can mess up
[1:05:34] everything do you know in science class
[1:05:36] years ago we Advanced science we in in
[1:05:39] school we did some experiments and you
[1:05:43] know the teacher after we had done this
[1:05:44] whole thing and heated these things with
[1:05:46] the little alcohol burners and the
[1:05:48] little glass tubes and things went up
[1:05:50] and separated and we we did this and
[1:05:52] that and and the teacher says now uh
[1:05:54] before we go to the next step and add
[1:05:56] the next ingredient how many of you put
[1:05:58] exactly what you were supposed to in the
[1:06:01] deal and some of the kids had just
[1:06:03] taking their little squeezer things you
[1:06:05] know and just ah that'll be
[1:06:10] enough and some of the kids he he got
[1:06:12] real serious with this I need to know
[1:06:15] some of the kids well we didn't really
[1:06:16] measure he goes okay shut your burner
[1:06:18] off you're
[1:06:19] done because if you have too much of
[1:06:24] this ingredient when we add the next
[1:06:27] ingredient it'll blow
[1:06:30] up and I was thinking
[1:06:33] H we're in high school you know they're
[1:06:36] not going to have the end of the
[1:06:37] building blow off here because a teacher
[1:06:40] wants to prove a point but let me tell
[1:06:42] you we added the ingredient we started
[1:06:45] to heat it to a certain temperature and
[1:06:47] the far end of the lab all of a sudden
[1:06:50] Beaker with the deal under it and all
[1:06:52] that stuff
[1:06:54] went and we're all just
[1:06:58] like and the teacher's
[1:07:01] like you thought I was lying to
[1:07:04] you this proves who in this class trusts
[1:07:10] me it's like it wouldn't have blowed the
[1:07:12] building up no just the
[1:07:16] beaker
[1:07:18] oh you know the rest of the year I mean
[1:07:21] you could almost see kids with a
[1:07:22] magnifying glass looking at stuff
[1:07:26] a little too much we better pour that
[1:07:28] out because they got to a point they
[1:07:31] trusted my brother and sister too much
[1:07:36] religion makes
[1:07:38] Fanatics too
[1:07:40] little means you're just
[1:07:44] lost but one's just as dangerous as the
[1:07:47] other because you know you can be a
[1:07:49] Fanatic in the
[1:07:52] negative that's right
[1:07:57] one word of God misplaced or
[1:07:58] misconstrued or not
[1:08:01] accepted breaks the whole Chain man
[1:08:04] shall not live by bread alone but by
[1:08:06] every word that proceeded out of the
[1:08:07] mouth of God so every word my brother
[1:08:10] and sister gives you and I are cross
[1:08:12] reference to take every idea we've ever
[1:08:15] had about the word every uh uh personal
[1:08:19] understanding every personal
[1:08:21] interpretation every personal revelation
[1:08:23] and we've got a whole my rid of things
[1:08:26] we can run it through to make sure it
[1:08:28] lines up there's no excuse for us to be
[1:08:30] out of the word there no excuse for us
[1:08:33] to not understand what God is speaking
[1:08:35] no excuse for us my brother and sister
[1:08:37] because I I'm getting to a point trust
[1:08:39] me here amen everything must be
[1:08:42] absolutely correct because I'm going to
[1:08:45] speak to you on a side note for a moment
[1:08:47] the veil is just like a filter
[1:08:50] everything that is not the word and not
[1:08:52] pleasing to God cannot get through the
[1:08:55] Veil
[1:08:56] amen and as you look at that everything
[1:08:59] as it is that we are living here today
[1:09:02] has to go through the filter of the word
[1:09:04] did the prophet not teach us that amen
[1:09:06] it has to go through that filter because
[1:09:09] if it can't make it through the filter
[1:09:11] it's not of God and I say today Lord let
[1:09:14] the word come let it filter our thoughts
[1:09:16] let it filter our Revelations
[1:09:18] understanding everything that we do Let
[1:09:20] It filter it Lord I don't need a bypass
[1:09:23] I don't need an excuse I don't need a
[1:09:25] reason why not to accept this because
[1:09:28] you said if it's not accepted that's
[1:09:31] just like being misplaced or
[1:09:34] misconstrued you got to accept it that's
[1:09:38] really you know that's a lot harder than
[1:09:39] you think I don't want to be negative
[1:09:41] this morning okay so I think that might
[1:09:43] be why the Lord you know blew up my my
[1:09:45] sermon this morning made it disappear I
[1:09:47] had a couple really sharp statements in
[1:09:49] there that was just you know growl when
[1:09:52] I spoke it and and I couldn't remember
[1:09:54] what they were by the time ago around to
[1:09:55] do it again so maybe that wasn't but
[1:09:59] look at this now I might sound like I'm
[1:10:00] growling but my brother and sister we're
[1:10:02] coming down to a day that when the
[1:10:05] prophet of God said the Bible is our
[1:10:08] final Authority our absolute amen now
[1:10:12] look what's happening in the world today
[1:10:14] is that I'm not talking out here in the
[1:10:16] methodists even though we'll touch on
[1:10:17] some of that stuff in a minute but we're
[1:10:19] looking my brother and sister that we're
[1:10:21] toning it down by giving an alternate
[1:10:24] alternative ative of what is our
[1:10:27] absolute we don't need another
[1:10:31] alternative the prophet gave us his word
[1:10:34] and said the Bible is our absolute let's
[1:10:37] just let that be our absolute okay we
[1:10:40] don't need to reconstr that readjust
[1:10:43] that change that a little bit amen now
[1:10:46] this absolute we just read some of the
[1:10:48] scripture involved right here but in
[1:10:51] this absolute it declared that we are
[1:10:53] the chosen of God
[1:10:56] my brother and sister let's go back to
[1:10:58] kids out on the baseball diamond you
[1:11:00] know how it used to be everybody lined
[1:11:02] up for a pickup game of baseball you
[1:11:04] know and you're there and two kids
[1:11:07] usually the more popular ones get chosen
[1:11:09] as the captains and everybody's there I
[1:11:11] hope they choose me let's see there are
[1:11:13] more kids standing here than it takes to
[1:11:15] make a baseball team and and um I hope I
[1:11:19] get
[1:11:20] chosen and you can see the Supreme
[1:11:22] disappointment to those kids who are not
[1:11:24] chosen
[1:11:27] and if you are
[1:11:30] chosen you don't walk over and play for
[1:11:32] the other
[1:11:34] team you play for the team that chose
[1:11:37] you and the word says that you are
[1:11:40] chosen and have found favor Above All
[1:11:44] Mankind I'm not going to go play for the
[1:11:46] other team I'm not going to say I wanted
[1:11:49] to play on that team or that team I'm
[1:11:51] just going to sit here and do nothing we
[1:11:53] are chosen and we're here today to
[1:11:55] Rejoice that we are chosen amen that the
[1:11:58] word has come and said you know what
[1:12:00] I've chose you to be my bride we don't
[1:12:02] go over and sorry for using these strong
[1:12:04] words we don't go act like the Harlot
[1:12:07] amen we we don't go over here and behave
[1:12:09] in an uncomely fashion when we have been
[1:12:12] chosen be the Bride of Jesus Christ amen
[1:12:15] we uh we are Rejoice that we were chosen
[1:12:19] amen cuz we've been birthed by the word
[1:12:21] Can someone say Amen we've been washed
[1:12:24] by the word amen amen thank the Lord for
[1:12:26] that amen we've been molded by the word
[1:12:30] imagine if we left ourselves to mold
[1:12:32] ourselves to be Christians what we would
[1:12:34] show up looking
[1:12:35] like I tell you that's the world I hope
[1:12:38] you don't find this offensive but
[1:12:40] there's not going to be any
[1:12:43] purple-haired body pierced earring
[1:12:46] wearing tattooed Christians in
[1:12:52] glory boy that's right
[1:12:55] Paul that was
[1:12:57] harsh there might be some ex
[1:13:01] purple-haired tattooed body pierced
[1:13:04] tattooed people but nobody's standing
[1:13:07] there glorying in what they are in this
[1:13:11] flesh they will have thank the Lord that
[1:13:14] he washed them amen look God calls them
[1:13:18] from all situations in life and we
[1:13:20] shouldn't be judgmental of that but we
[1:13:22] can't continue on in what creat created
[1:13:25] us to be that we can't continue on that
[1:13:29] and then say Oh I'm chosen of God God's
[1:13:31] word is very very narrow my brother and
[1:13:34] sister and the world doesn't line they
[1:13:36] say you're bigoted you're very
[1:13:38] narrow-minded but my brother and sister
[1:13:40] my Bible yes my Bible and if you have a
[1:13:43] Bible your Bible well okay this goes on
[1:13:46] later in the sermon excuse me we're
[1:13:47] jumping ahead you wonder why there's all
[1:13:50] kinds of these new translations of the
[1:13:52] Bible is because they continue to water
[1:13:55] it and water it until it has nothing no
[1:14:01] power means nothing that's
[1:14:04] right I watched a clip the other day I
[1:14:06] hope this doesn't offend anyone I
[1:14:08] watched a clip that was taken somebody's
[1:14:10] phone in a church service the pastor
[1:14:13] preaching on a very strong
[1:14:16] subject and he says church I hope this
[1:14:18] doesn't offend you or make you mad but I
[1:14:20] would just like to see by a show of
[1:14:22] hands how many of you are not married
[1:14:23] and living together
[1:14:25] and the camera panned the congregation
[1:14:28] hundreds and hundreds of people and
[1:14:30] hundreds and hundreds of hands were
[1:14:35] raised then the pastor you see that he
[1:14:37] watered it down because then he says
[1:14:39] well don't fear your Christians God
[1:14:42] loves you you're
[1:14:45] saved but you should
[1:14:50] consider well I is
[1:14:53] right yeah that's like the old priest
[1:14:55] telling the young priest there's
[1:14:56] something you got to quit doing and the
[1:14:58] young priest says what do I need to quit
[1:15:00] doing he says when people come in the
[1:15:02] confessional you got to quit saying
[1:15:08] wow my brother and sister it's a wow
[1:15:12] it's the age we're living in is that
[1:15:15] Beyond the Veil no my brother and sister
[1:15:17] I know this may be a little strong and
[1:15:19] direct we have visitors I hope it's not
[1:15:20] offensive but my brother and sister you
[1:15:22] have to preach what God lays upon your
[1:15:24] heart to preach you see we've been
[1:15:26] molded by the word that means we've been
[1:15:29] changed from that Old creature into a
[1:15:31] new creature amen we've been dressed by
[1:15:33] the word amen we're no longer dressing
[1:15:37] oursel we're no longer dressing oursel
[1:15:39] he is dressing us and when he dresses us
[1:15:43] people will say you're weird well my
[1:15:45] brother and sister if that's what God
[1:15:47] wants you to be then just be that don't
[1:15:50] care what the world cares because the
[1:15:52] world's not going to get Beyond the Veil
[1:15:55] amen now in the seventh Church age let's
[1:15:58] look at this real
[1:16:00] quick when the bride has been committed
[1:16:02] to the groom take this natural spiritual
[1:16:04] take it any way you please when the
[1:16:07] bride has been committed to the groom
[1:16:09] she takes off her veil so when the
[1:16:12] commitment actually comes we won't get
[1:16:15] into a whole deal of of of courtship and
[1:16:17] Etc because at the point that you say
[1:16:19] I'll marry you and you both in our
[1:16:22] agreements you're actually committed
[1:16:26] but let's look at this as the ceremony
[1:16:29] they've come here comes the bride
[1:16:32] beautiful bride dressed in white all of
[1:16:35] her
[1:16:35] bridesmaids the
[1:16:37] groom well not all are handsome so
[1:16:40] anyway uh we'll leave that alone but
[1:16:43] he's got his
[1:16:44] groomsmen they come they do vows they
[1:16:47] present a ring they they go through the
[1:16:50] whole thing and um then what happens I'm
[1:16:56] getting old what happens right after
[1:16:58] they get done with that portion of
[1:17:08] everything
[1:17:10] he
[1:17:12] lifts the
[1:17:16] rug it's not a rug is
[1:17:18] it it's a
[1:17:21] veil she can see him and he can see
[1:17:26] her but there's a veil between that's
[1:17:29] right and is at the point it comes you
[1:17:31] may kiss the bride he lifts the veil and
[1:17:35] if you've ever been to very many
[1:17:38] weddings it can be interesting I've seen
[1:17:40] him everything from the veil was to so
[1:17:42] big he kept lifting it and it would
[1:17:44] slide this way and that way and seen
[1:17:46] them pull it completely off their head
[1:17:48] uh seen a whole lot of things but let's
[1:17:50] just talk normal and he goes over there
[1:17:53] and he lifts the veil she doesn't lift
[1:17:56] her own Veil but we've seen that
[1:17:59] happen kind of like man who is this guy
[1:18:02] I'm marrying he can't even lift a simple
[1:18:04] Veil here but he lifts the veil then he
[1:18:08] gets to kiss the
[1:18:10] bride hopefully their first
[1:18:14] kiss but you see imagine what it how
[1:18:17] awkward it would be if he goes to kiss
[1:18:20] her and he decides he's not lifting the
[1:18:22] veil so he just kisses her right through
[1:18:24] through the
[1:18:26] veil it'd be like huh seems like in the
[1:18:30] first few seconds of our marriage
[1:18:32] there's something already come between
[1:18:35] us because you see you can't make that a
[1:18:40] full
[1:18:42] relationship until the veil is
[1:18:45] lifted and you know when the veil is
[1:18:47] lifted and he kisses his bride that
[1:18:50] starts you know as brother Bram speaks
[1:18:51] about this that three- room house my
[1:18:54] brother and sister you can have the
[1:18:55] kitchen and you can have the living room
[1:18:57] but it's not a relationship until it
[1:18:59] makes it to the bedroom I hope that's
[1:19:01] not too strong of words for anybody but
[1:19:03] you see without the relationship being
[1:19:07] completed it's just living together in
[1:19:11] in a very traditional sense uh you know
[1:19:13] not the modern definition of living
[1:19:15] together so it'd be just like oh we have
[1:19:18] Fellowship we had a ceremony and we have
[1:19:20] Fellowship that's not marriage that's
[1:19:22] right amen so we look look at this now
[1:19:26] uh committed she takes off the veil
[1:19:29] places it over on the groom's shoulders
[1:19:30] this very common in South America we've
[1:19:32] seen this a lot down there amen they pin
[1:19:35] it on the bridegroom's shoulder amen so
[1:19:39] signifying that not only is she under
[1:19:41] his Dominion that she has transferred
[1:19:44] her rights to him that he is the head
[1:19:47] but also see now in the feminist world
[1:19:50] we live in they're like I'm not going to
[1:19:51] be that no my brother and sister you see
[1:19:54] that's what the problem is is you got
[1:19:56] two people driving the car you got two
[1:19:58] people making the decision I'm not
[1:20:00] talking about cooperation I'm talking
[1:20:02] about a battle that's right I'm talking
[1:20:04] about Warfare I'm talking about we're
[1:20:06] going to do this my way we're going to
[1:20:07] do this my way we're not doing it at all
[1:20:09] kind of an atmosphere but you see as it
[1:20:12] comes we see it down through history but
[1:20:15] now it's eroding
[1:20:17] away she's transferred her rights to him
[1:20:21] amen that he is the head but also see
[1:20:24] that's not just for a man to say wife
[1:20:27] although I've done
[1:20:29] that
[1:20:33] Brothers No
[1:20:36] volunteers come on we're in church it's
[1:20:38] time to be
[1:20:40] truthful but you see maybe in our
[1:20:43] impatience or whatever we might speak
[1:20:46] that way but this is a part of
[1:20:49] you left hand I told you we're going to
[1:20:52] the garage come on
[1:20:55] no it don't work that way these two are
[1:20:57] now one amen Lord help us that we
[1:21:00] misconstrue that misunderstand that
[1:21:02] that's right come on he Bears
[1:21:06] responsibility and care and he and he
[1:21:10] alone amen amen I tell you what this
[1:21:14] comes out of a real life story that we
[1:21:16] won't go into but you know you're in
[1:21:18] trouble when you come home from work and
[1:21:19] the neighbor is in your house doing the
[1:21:22] honeydews for your wife that's right
[1:21:26] there's trouble on the
[1:21:28] horizon it's him and him alone that
[1:21:31] bears the responsibility and the care
[1:21:34] and he and he alone no else no other man
[1:21:37] no other power has any right and
[1:21:39] responsibility and that beloved is the
[1:21:41] Key of David God being Sovereign he
[1:21:43] fornew by Divine decree exactly who
[1:21:46] would be his bride amen now if we take
[1:21:49] this away don't think I'm here preaching
[1:21:51] to put the sisters down nonsense I'll
[1:21:53] tell you what we do when we have balance
[1:21:55] in our home we Empower our wives our
[1:21:58] daughters we Empower not degrade we
[1:22:01] Empower them to be able to be bold in
[1:22:04] who they are and the position God has
[1:22:06] put them in but in the world we live in
[1:22:09] today they think Rebellion is
[1:22:12] righteous Rebellion is not righteous
[1:22:15] it's a sin of
[1:22:16] Witchcraft and he chose her she did not
[1:22:20] choose him he called her she did not
[1:22:23] come on her own he died for her we're
[1:22:25] talking about our lord Jesus now he died
[1:22:28] for her he washed her in his own blood
[1:22:30] he paid the price for her she belongs to
[1:22:33] him and him alone the problem is we've
[1:22:36] now broken the pattern of
[1:22:39] ownership am in the world of feminism
[1:22:42] they would decry and scream and say I
[1:22:44] was some kind of weird whatever but when
[1:22:46] you look at the Gospel of Jesus Christ
[1:22:49] and even in the courts of our nation in
[1:22:51] times past Jerry belongs to me
[1:22:55] that's right right but without the right
[1:22:59] understanding it brings up a in the
[1:23:02] people how dare you think your wife
[1:23:04] belongs to you well she certainly don't
[1:23:06] belong to the
[1:23:08] neighbor H right come on She's
[1:23:13] mine and this probably needs to be
[1:23:15] edited out but I tell you what I'd kill
[1:23:17] to defend
[1:23:18] her nobody's going to come and cause
[1:23:20] trouble in my house and me stand back
[1:23:22] and say well I don't know maybe he has a
[1:23:24] right to do this maybe somebody else
[1:23:27] gave him
[1:23:28] permission yeah no feet first head first
[1:23:32] he's leaving that's
[1:23:35] right edit that
[1:23:39] Brothers wash her own blood he paid the
[1:23:41] price for her she belongs to him and him
[1:23:43] alone she is wholly committed to him and
[1:23:45] he accepts the obligation he is her head
[1:23:49] for Christ is the head of his church and
[1:23:51] Sarah called Abraham Lord even so
[1:23:53] there's the happy that he is her uh he
[1:23:57] is her Lord he speaks and she obeys for
[1:24:00] that is her Delight you know you know
[1:24:02] what he's saying let me interpret that
[1:24:04] we're not here going woe is me to be a
[1:24:06] Christian we're here saying you know
[1:24:09] what thank you he asked me to live I
[1:24:11] will live he asked me to give I will
[1:24:14] give he asked me to walk I will walk he
[1:24:16] asked me to do I will do amen and I'm
[1:24:20] happy to do this
[1:24:27] I already touched on this but I'll just
[1:24:29] go through it again make sure that I
[1:24:31] preach long
[1:24:33] enough look into the marriage
[1:24:35] relationship a real relationship
[1:24:38] actually begins after the lifting of the
[1:24:42] veil there's where the real relationship
[1:24:45] starts amen that becomes then a three-
[1:24:49] room house we're not sitting on the
[1:24:51] porch amen we've got the kitchen we've
[1:24:54] got the living room to Fellowship in and
[1:24:55] we've got a bedroom for relationship I
[1:24:58] hope that's acceptable wording and so
[1:25:01] this is my brother and sister the same
[1:25:03] with the Lord amen If this relationship
[1:25:08] with the Lord if that Veil is not lifted
[1:25:11] are you with me if that Veil is not
[1:25:13] lifted and placed upon Christ we don't
[1:25:17] have a relationship we have religion
[1:25:21] that's right I don't want religion I
[1:25:23] want a relation ship the word of God
[1:25:25] says that we are the bride of Christ
[1:25:28] we're not roommates we're not friends
[1:25:31] with benefits sorry to say it that way
[1:25:33] we're not people just cohabitating we
[1:25:36] are a very portion of him by the word
[1:25:41] amen amen but I'll tell you what
[1:25:45] happens this world that we live in what
[1:25:48] happens is is people settle for less
[1:25:51] than what God gave them and so there's
[1:25:54] no depth of the relationship and as it
[1:25:56] comes and goes and comes and goes they
[1:25:59] become callous to that that's right no
[1:26:04] commitment though God slay
[1:26:08] me I'll trust him until it happens
[1:26:12] again no sir though God slay me yet I
[1:26:17] will serve him amen
[1:26:21] amen see people don't understand when
[1:26:23] brother Brown made that statement people
[1:26:25] called it idiotic statement when he said
[1:26:27] even if I knew God was going to send me
[1:26:28] to hell I would still serve him they
[1:26:31] don't understand the depth of a
[1:26:32] relationship they take it on a carnal
[1:26:34] level there's no way anybody would do
[1:26:37] that but I tell you when you ever had
[1:26:39] the veil lifted and you come face to
[1:26:41] face with our Lord Jesus Christ and He
[1:26:43] blesses you you stand there and you know
[1:26:46] there's nothing else on this earth that
[1:26:48] is like this relationship with him and I
[1:26:50] say thank you Lord for that amen and if
[1:26:53] there's no depth of the
[1:26:55] relationship then it's just man's
[1:26:58] decision man's
[1:27:00] leadership
[1:27:03] man's understanding amen that's
[1:27:11] it so I'll get this backwards
[1:27:15] here but now I don't have to I'll just
[1:27:18] I'll just go like
[1:27:21] a we know what brother Brown said about
[1:27:24] that denominational spirit in leadership
[1:27:26] right there shouldn't be a person in
[1:27:28] here that's a believer that doesn't know
[1:27:31] what he said about that right and I
[1:27:34] always found it interesting this is a
[1:27:35] little Mantra of mine a little little
[1:27:38] whatever I always find it interesting
[1:27:41] people explaining God who can't even
[1:27:43] explain
[1:27:45] themselves I love that I stood and
[1:27:48] listen to a guy the other day talking
[1:27:49] about farming to someone and he was
[1:27:52] talking about well you one of the first
[1:27:54] things you do is you just go out there
[1:27:56] and you put these chemicals on the
[1:27:57] ground that keeps everything but the
[1:27:59] crop you're growing from
[1:28:05] growing
[1:28:07] oh okay I know what kind of farmer you
[1:28:10] are
[1:28:13] bankrupt and he went on with his whole
[1:28:16] thing and I thought you
[1:28:19] know
[1:28:20] interesting finally I had to do I said
[1:28:23] you
[1:28:24] you grew up on a
[1:28:26] farm he goes no no I visited my
[1:28:29] grandfather's farm when I was a
[1:28:31] kid
[1:28:33] awesome
[1:28:35] yeah denominational
[1:28:39] leadership we I want all you to be good
[1:28:43] godly people so what we're going to do
[1:28:45] is almost weekly add a new rule book new
[1:28:49] page in the book of the things you must
[1:28:52] do to be a good Christian
[1:28:56] can you find me
[1:29:03] scripture we were released from the law
[1:29:06] can someone say thank you
[1:29:08] Lord but we weren't released from Christ
[1:29:12] that's
[1:29:14] right so people think we're released
[1:29:16] from the law so I can go do what I want
[1:29:18] now and God will have Grace that I can
[1:29:20] become a drunken thieving liar cheating
[1:29:23] whatever
[1:29:24] and I'll have
[1:29:26] Grace no we were released from the law
[1:29:29] but we weren't released from Christ
[1:29:30] because we already read the scripture he
[1:29:32] wrote it on our heart and our heart was
[1:29:35] there receptive to receive that writing
[1:29:39] upon it and and that just makes me so
[1:29:42] happy so you know man's ideas of what
[1:29:44] God meant we touched on that uh of man's
[1:29:47] expectations my brother and sister I'll
[1:29:49] tell you what my expectation as pastor
[1:29:51] of a church here you know what my
[1:29:52] expectation of you is
[1:29:55] are you guys ready for
[1:29:56] this it's pretty
[1:29:59] straightforward it's pretty strong read
[1:30:02] it and believe that's right that's my
[1:30:06] expectation of you cuz I can tell you
[1:30:08] what I think you should believe and it
[1:30:11] won't change you at all but when you
[1:30:13] read it and believe this is what you
[1:30:15] should be it will entirely change your
[1:30:18] whole life because Jesus Christ no man
[1:30:21] ever or woman ever met Christ face to
[1:30:24] face the veil lifted met him face to
[1:30:27] face and walked away the same impossible
[1:30:30] to
[1:30:31] do that's right so now you guys hold on
[1:30:38] okay I've been reading a
[1:30:43] book it's called the death of a
[1:30:49] church should had sister VI up here to
[1:30:52] play a funeral song
[1:30:58] it was published been studied for a
[1:31:00] decade previous but published in
[1:31:02] 1967 I want you to understand that
[1:31:04] because it tells you the era it tells
[1:31:07] you the time frame the mentality of
[1:31:09] religion in
[1:31:12] America published in
[1:31:14] 1967 the man who wrote it had a lot of
[1:31:18] Das I don't know what that stands for
[1:31:22] DDS LLS
[1:31:25] ELO I I'm sure they stand for
[1:31:28] something and he's wrote in this book I
[1:31:31] read sister Jerry a quotation out of
[1:31:33] this book and she's like oh my but you
[1:31:36] see he's explaining why the church is
[1:31:40] dying and the reason the church is dying
[1:31:44] is because we have now see this is so
[1:31:47] powerfully true he said We have replaced
[1:31:49] man uh the the scripture with man's
[1:31:52] ideas and then he offers his ideas what
[1:31:55] we should do to do about that see so
[1:31:58] while he had it right he didn't have it
[1:32:00] right what he did is took him out of
[1:32:03] this controlling spirit and placed him
[1:32:05] over here in this controlling spirit and
[1:32:08] said because we have a few less pages in
[1:32:10] our rule book you're better off you're
[1:32:12] Freer than you were before and in there
[1:32:15] he goes through and he starts in and one
[1:32:16] of the things he says is how they
[1:32:19] rearranged rearranged the Trinity of the
[1:32:21] catechism and a few of these things they
[1:32:23] rearrange the wording all to the
[1:32:26] detriment of the people and so it's
[1:32:28] there that we have to understand that
[1:32:31] the Trinity is not being explained
[1:32:33] correctly I thought yep you got that
[1:32:35] right amen the Trinity is not explained
[1:32:38] correctly but they still believe that
[1:32:40] you've got three distinct
[1:32:44] people in one
[1:32:47] God Common Sense will not even allow you
[1:32:49] to embrace
[1:32:51] that we don't understand and it it's
[1:32:55] powerful and true though well I'm sorry
[1:32:59] my Bible says that it's in this day that
[1:33:01] the Mysteries would be fully revealed
[1:33:03] and you cannot complicate it with big
[1:33:05] words and more writing and stack it on
[1:33:08] and stack it on and stack it on and say
[1:33:10] we have a greater Revelation no my
[1:33:12] brother and sister I'm not going to go
[1:33:13] into that but you can go right back to
[1:33:15] the NAA Council you can go right back in
[1:33:17] history and it's so blaring and glaring
[1:33:20] in front of them but they're blinded to
[1:33:22] it and they want you to be blinded with
[1:33:26] them we can't explain it but you need to
[1:33:28] believe it well I'm sorry my brother and
[1:33:31] sister I'm not going to believe
[1:33:32] something that's not in the Bible I'm
[1:33:34] not going to believe something you know
[1:33:36] I've told it here in the church before
[1:33:38] amen about how that time we went and and
[1:33:41] and Jerry's dad wanted to take us
[1:33:42] through the uh uh uh Metropolitan Museum
[1:33:46] in in Seattle do you any of remember me
[1:33:48] telling that story amen okay I can tell
[1:33:50] it again good it's not just me as an old
[1:33:52] man forgetting
[1:33:54] I didn't even want to go we walk in the
[1:33:56] door uh her dad is a um I don't know a
[1:33:59] member whatever lifelong member whatever
[1:34:02] we walk in the door got some guests
[1:34:03] today my my daughter my son-in-law
[1:34:06] grandchildren and I walk in there and
[1:34:08] hanging from the ceiling is an old Buick
[1:34:11] with holes punched in and plastic pipes
[1:34:13] pointing every which
[1:34:16] direction that is awesome
[1:34:22] art then there was a little
[1:34:25] sign this is a foundation of abstract
[1:34:29] art they ain't got a foundation at all
[1:34:32] man that's not
[1:34:33] art that's an old car with holes punched
[1:34:36] and pipes going through it but I tell
[1:34:38] you what pretty
[1:34:39] soon we went I remember so distinct can
[1:34:42] I share all the details you went in the
[1:34:45] great big foer there restrooms were
[1:34:47] right here admittance desk here in a big
[1:34:49] slope stairway or the elevator and you
[1:34:52] go up and you walk in the room and here
[1:34:55] is all these marble and granite and
[1:34:59] whatever all these
[1:35:03] um
[1:35:05] statues Buss all these things and I get
[1:35:09] to the first one I start
[1:35:12] reading he sucked me right
[1:35:16] [Applause]
[1:35:18] in No cameras allowed these things are
[1:35:21] what what what's the museum the is where
[1:35:24] they were un loan from estimated to be
[1:35:27] worth billions of dollars this display
[1:35:30] they had security laser beams everywhere
[1:35:32] signs don't even touch the
[1:35:34] glass No cameras no notebooks no
[1:35:39] nothing I read the first one and I'm
[1:35:43] like
[1:35:45] wow now this is going to sound like I
[1:35:47] was an
[1:35:50] unbeliever but this is what happened I'm
[1:35:53] willing to admit it I read that first
[1:35:56] plaque and I was
[1:35:59] like I'm sure they didn't take
[1:36:01] that out of the church age
[1:36:06] book it's really the way it was what
[1:36:08] brother Bram told us brother Trevor just
[1:36:10] right
[1:36:11] here I go over the next one I read it
[1:36:16] next one I read it I read it they're
[1:36:21] done with the museum I'm still in the
[1:36:22] first room
[1:36:25] because there was a
[1:36:26] sermon engraved in every
[1:36:30] plaque about how they chose to replace
[1:36:35] themselves as
[1:36:37] gods and presented them themselves to
[1:36:40] the people as Gods because it was either
[1:36:45] easier to cause the people to follow in
[1:36:50] that realm than it was to control them
[1:36:53] as a
[1:36:56] government you understand what I'm
[1:36:58] saying they turned them into
[1:37:02] followers not unruly people they got the
[1:37:06] masses to want to follow this and they
[1:37:10] had more Gods second room plaque after
[1:37:14] plaque after plaque this was God and
[1:37:16] some of these names you would know just
[1:37:18] from school and history and time you
[1:37:20] know they got all these they've got men
[1:37:22] and they've got women women and they're
[1:37:24] Gods and they're this and they're that
[1:37:26] and when I got out of there I was just
[1:37:27] like Shell Shocked I was like my here
[1:37:30] was a church age book right here in a
[1:37:32] museum and everything that was laid out
[1:37:35] is laid right there in history of how it
[1:37:38] was and the latest uh more or less the
[1:37:40] latest stuff of this even brought an
[1:37:43] element of how they pulled this God and
[1:37:47] this God and put them together to create
[1:37:52] this God
[1:37:54] and that God was considered a righteous
[1:37:59] man and was it
[1:38:04] NAA let's run it through the
[1:38:07] filter how far will it go will that get
[1:38:12] you through the
[1:38:14] veil no it won't but you see let me get
[1:38:18] back to my thought here see it was a
[1:38:20] diagnosis of the cause of the failure of
[1:38:22] the church I told you I I read some of
[1:38:24] that to Sister Jerry and she's like that
[1:38:27] don't even make sense but but it's a
[1:38:29] pretty good sized book see he warns he
[1:38:32] says you know what happens when you get
[1:38:33] away from the
[1:38:34] word h you you go away from the word you
[1:38:38] you you go and you'll believe it says it
[1:38:41] right here in this book when you get
[1:38:42] away from the word you'll believe
[1:38:44] anything and then turns around and
[1:38:46] builds a foundation of why this is what
[1:38:48] they should be believing and it's not in
[1:38:52] the word talk about
[1:38:55] spirits okay I'm going to drop the balm
[1:38:57] shell on you here and then I'll hurry
[1:38:59] out so nobody can
[1:39:02] anyway see when you get away from the
[1:39:05] word well when you start going away from
[1:39:07] the argument here's an argument what's
[1:39:10] the
[1:39:11] absolute come on I want to throw this
[1:39:13] out here I don't mean to offend anybody
[1:39:15] here today but what's the
[1:39:16] absolute what the prophet say the
[1:39:18] absolute was what do leaders in this
[1:39:21] message say the absolute is
[1:39:25] that's
[1:39:27] right that quieted y'all
[1:39:30] down is this any different than how the
[1:39:34] church
[1:39:35] died or
[1:39:38] NAA You' got another
[1:39:41] substitute what do we do we rewrite the
[1:39:44] Bible in Kinder terms this is why we
[1:39:46] have so many versions of the Bible they
[1:39:48] keep rewriting it to soften it slowly
[1:39:50] not quickly they want it to come in such
[1:39:53] a fashion that people don't even realize
[1:39:56] there's no power left in the word that
[1:39:58] they're
[1:39:58] reading amen so they rewrite it to
[1:40:01] kinder terms and and they reconstruct
[1:40:04] these are words that I read here not my
[1:40:06] words they reconstruct the Bible to make
[1:40:08] it acceptable I want to know my brother
[1:40:11] and sister what is not acceptable about
[1:40:14] this what is not amen it calls Sin Sin
[1:40:18] it calls Glory Glory it calls righteous
[1:40:20] righteous amen it calls a all the other
[1:40:23] negatives it calls them what they are
[1:40:26] the positive it calls them what they are
[1:40:28] amen will this will the word go through
[1:40:31] God's
[1:40:33] filter it is the
[1:40:35] filter amen so if we soften
[1:40:40] this you know I I'll get carried away
[1:40:43] here forgive
[1:40:45] me my dad worked in a Cheese plant in
[1:40:48] the later years of his life his working
[1:40:51] life
[1:40:53] they were constantly exploring different
[1:40:55] things of ways to make
[1:40:58] cheese and they would also go in there
[1:41:01] and dig out the Vats when it didn't
[1:41:05] work my brother and sister when you pour
[1:41:08] something besides the word into the
[1:41:10] pride you can't dig it
[1:41:13] out when you put that in there it takes
[1:41:16] a holy ghost move in a man or woman's
[1:41:19] life to draw those traditions of men
[1:41:23] back out to draw all of that nanism and
[1:41:28] all of this stuff it takes to draw this
[1:41:31] all
[1:41:32] out you know they have to come up with
[1:41:34] words to fit it you know if you believe
[1:41:36] there's one God you're you're
[1:41:39] modalist why don't they just say one
[1:41:42] God because they need a word in their
[1:41:46] language to express it and then they
[1:41:49] throw that out like it's an insult
[1:41:53] you don't believe you're this and you're
[1:41:57] that you're a
[1:41:59] cult well praise God I am definition of
[1:42:04] a cult someone following someone right
[1:42:07] that's the real Street version of a cult
[1:42:09] I'm so glad I follow Jesus that's right
[1:42:11] amen I'm so glad that I'm following him
[1:42:15] amen while they themselves church was
[1:42:18] started by someone amen they can't see
[1:42:22] that now now the Bible
[1:42:25] translations I'm closing up
[1:42:28] here we're seeing everything he
[1:42:31] spoke come to pass amen let's not be
[1:42:35] blinded by our busyness of life and the
[1:42:37] cares of Life Saints we are seeing this
[1:42:40] come to pass right before our
[1:42:44] eyes come on I I I say this kind of
[1:42:47] funny hope it doesn't offend anybody but
[1:42:50] you know there was a brother one time
[1:42:51] says well I don't quite see it but do
[1:42:53] you think that Camala Harris might be
[1:42:54] that beautiful woman brother brand was
[1:42:56] talking about and I said absolutely not
[1:42:59] amen that's no that's that can't be
[1:43:02] brother just change your
[1:43:04] thinking he was like you're
[1:43:08] right but you see what's happening that
[1:43:11] scares me I'm reading a book about the
[1:43:14] death of a
[1:43:15] church and what scared me
[1:43:17] Saints is when I read certain lines I
[1:43:21] was like there it is is that's right I
[1:43:25] read more few more pages another
[1:43:29] chapter it's already
[1:43:32] come it's it's already
[1:43:38] here that's what scared me we're not
[1:43:41] looking oh this will come someday no no
[1:43:44] here's a denominational man with more
[1:43:46] titles behind his name than I can even
[1:43:48] remember telling you this is what's
[1:43:51] happening and I see
[1:43:56] it you wonder if it's close or
[1:43:59] not you see we're working to make the
[1:44:02] message more
[1:44:05] acceptable we're also making it more
[1:44:07] convenient yeah right don't even have to
[1:44:10] leave your house on Sunday or your tent
[1:44:12] or your motor home or your
[1:44:16] boat right wait I'm probably the only
[1:44:18] one here that has a boat we'll retract
[1:44:21] that no it's the truth that's right it's
[1:44:24] the truth Saints yes amen and what I
[1:44:27] read it scares me the very things they
[1:44:30] write about I see in our midst that's
[1:44:33] right now that I've given you this
[1:44:34] Downer I want to close sister V could
[1:44:36] come the piano so that way brother Paul
