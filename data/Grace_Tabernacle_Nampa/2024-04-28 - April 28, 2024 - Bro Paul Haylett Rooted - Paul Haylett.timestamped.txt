[27:41] God the same yesterday today and
[27:45] forever amen I tell you it's just
[27:47] wonderful can we just give the Lord a
[27:49] hand clap of Praise today let him know
[27:52] how much we thank him how important he
[27:55] is to us how he's changed in our
[28:00] lives
[28:04] amen as as Christians we have to have
[28:08] something now we talk about the word of
[28:11] God we talk about the message we talk
[28:13] about being grounded and anchored this
[28:16] morning I want to preach to you I
[28:18] hopefully a little step in our thoughts
[28:20] but I want to just preach you on an
[28:22] overall thought of being rooted amen you
[28:26] know my brother and sister we we we read
[28:29] the story we hear the words you know
[28:32] that uh in the
[28:33] storm as the stress moving the tree it
[28:37] loosens the roots in the earth and gives
[28:40] them room to grow and uh if it was all
[28:43] just nice and easy you know a few years
[28:46] ago I had a friend he Farms down by the
[28:49] bar uh boisey River and uh the wind come
[28:53] up the river there and just big
[28:55] beautiful Majestic trees on his property
[28:58] and they all just blew over one right
[29:00] after another it's just in the natural
[29:03] just tragic to see these very very old
[29:06] trees and uh he was sharing with me and
[29:10] and I wouldn't say he's over religious
[29:12] guy but he said you know he said those
[29:14] trees they were by that
[29:17] River they didn't have to put any Roots
[29:20] down and when the wind come they didn't
[29:23] have anything to Anchor them and you
[29:26] know it just makes perfect sense the
[29:28] prophet of God talks about these things
[29:29] you see if life is too
[29:33] easy we have no
[29:36] root and today we're going to talk about
[29:39] being rooted just to look at this to
[29:41] realize the Reason God shakes your life
[29:44] sometimes or allows it to be shaken is
[29:47] because he wants you to be by the rivers
[29:51] of Living Water but he doesn't want your
[29:54] roots to be that deep he wants them to
[29:57] go very deep amen we're not rooted in
[30:01] this Earth We're rooted in Jesus Christ
[30:04] amen he knows how to bring us to that
[30:06] place God bless you thank you so much
[30:08] wonderful song service and uh our
[30:11] musicians uh let's um just uh uh our
[30:15] brother da up in kville Washington just
[30:19] uh uh has a couple decisions he needs to
[30:22] make I just ask you uh to remember him
[30:25] in prayer uh and uh also
[30:28] just like to remember there's multiple
[30:31] of churches in the Edmonton Alberta
[30:33] Canada area but let's just lift the
[30:36] Saints in in Edmonton up amen uh no
[30:40] specific need but let's just be faithful
[30:43] right we're part of a body part of a
[30:45] family amen as much as I covet your
[30:49] prayers um and uh and I pray for you uh
[30:53] we need to pray beyond our our borders
[30:56] as it were and and lift up this bright
[30:58] of Christ um now I've chosen just uh you
[31:01] know kind of this area cuz imagine now
[31:04] trying to pray for every church so
[31:07] sometimes the Lord just allows us to lay
[31:09] a little blanket of prayer over an area
[31:13] and that's why this morning I say pray
[31:15] for the Saints in Edmonton uh just lay
[31:17] the blanket over that area we don't even
[31:20] know but a handful of people there uh
[31:23] but God just touch each one the
[31:25] Believers of that area amen amen so
[31:29] let's turn in our Bibles this morning in
[31:32] the Book of Judges the 6th chapter
[31:34] starting with the sixth verse and um
[31:38] we'll just touch on a few topics this
[31:40] morning uh a lot of this I'll just tell
[31:43] you off the bat I won't I won't um I
[31:46] don't have a lot of quotes from this but
[31:49] um just been listening to the message
[31:53] have not I sent thee and uh I would
[31:56] encourage you to listen to it it's very
[31:58] very uh in my opinion very power packed
[32:02] uh sermon uh just profound brother
[32:05] brandham is not trying to make profound
[32:08] statements but it just simply is
[32:11] profound and so I'd encourage you to to
[32:14] listen to that amen judges the 6th
[32:17] chapter
[32:19] 6-14 and Israel was greatly impoverished
[32:23] because of the midianites and the
[32:25] children of Israel Cried unto the Lord
[32:27] and it came to pass when the children of
[32:29] Israel Cried unto the Lord because of
[32:31] the midnights that the Lord sent a
[32:34] prophet unto the children of Israel
[32:36] which said unto them thus sayith the
[32:39] Lord God of Israel I brought you up from
[32:41] Egypt and brought you forth out of the
[32:44] house of bondage and I delivered you out
[32:47] of the hand of the Egyptians and out of
[32:49] the hand of all that oppressed you and
[32:52] drave them from before you and gave you
[32:56] their land and I said said unto you I am
[32:58] the Lord your God fear not the gods of
[33:02] the amorites in whose land you dwell
[33:04] fear not the
[33:09] gods of America that's
[33:16] right we we're not called to have
[33:19] fear amen God's not going to give you
[33:22] victory over here and leave you an
[33:23] abject Terror over here what's going to
[33:27] happen to our children God's got it in
[33:28] control that's right amen but I read in
[33:31] this scripture oh to those that are with
[33:33] child oh my brother and sister you
[33:36] either trust God or you don't amen it's
[33:39] time for us to just completely trust the
[33:41] Lord time for us to put all fears and
[33:44] anxieties and all questions of Tomorrow
[33:47] behind us and
[33:49] live absolute 100% in confidence that
[33:53] God is in control and live like it amen
[33:57] fear not the gods of the amorites in
[33:59] whose land you dwell but ye have not
[34:03] obeyed my voice see these words can be
[34:06] pretty judgmental in a sense my brother
[34:08] and sister he he's giving them courage
[34:11] uh you're dwelling in this land but
[34:12] don't fear but wait just a second you
[34:15] haven't obeyed my voice see it's you and
[34:19] I that let in the doubts and the fears
[34:22] and the trouble God does not cause it to
[34:25] come upon us amen now that's a two-edged
[34:29] sword because people will then say but
[34:31] what about job well I'll tell you God
[34:33] chose to let that hedge be open for job
[34:36] because job was upright and righteous
[34:39] that's a lot different than you and I
[34:41] opening the Hedge because we want to
[34:43] satisfy the flesh we want to satisfy our
[34:46] our desires our longings amen so you
[34:49] have to rightly divide the word of God
[34:52] and there came an angel of the Lord and
[34:53] sit under an oak which was in um ofra
[34:58] that pertained unto Joes the boy they
[35:02] couldn't they use
[35:03] English azerite and his son Gideon
[35:06] thrashed Wheat by the wine press to hide
[35:08] it from the midianites hiding the
[35:10] message amen and the angel of the Lord
[35:13] appeared unto him and said unto him the
[35:15] Lord is with thee thy Mighty Man of
[35:17] Valor and Gideon said unto him now this
[35:20] is really verse 13 kind of the Crux of
[35:22] our thought today and Gideon said unto
[35:25] him oh my Lord if the Lord be with it
[35:28] why then is all this befallen
[35:31] us and where be all his miracles which
[35:34] our fathers told us of saying did not
[35:37] the Lord bring us up from Egypt but now
[35:40] the Lord hath forsaken us and delivered
[35:44] us into the hands of the
[35:45] midianites now my brother and sister I
[35:47] want you to look how quickly the Lord
[35:49] can change our
[35:52] situation if we just took this clip and
[35:56] cut right into it and that was the only
[35:58] portion it would sure appear that Gideon
[36:02] was on his way out of the
[36:04] message it would appear as he was ready
[36:07] to give up because God has forsaken us
[36:10] and has let this be fallen us come on
[36:13] let's be honest this morning how many
[36:15] times has circumstance come and we said
[36:17] Lord why did this befall me why am I now
[36:21] I'm a
[36:22] Believer
[36:25] why but I want you to see how quickly as
[36:28] we we won't read all the scripture but
[36:29] you go right down through the sixth
[36:31] chapter into the seventh and you'll see
[36:33] how quickly God changed Gideon's point
[36:35] of view I want you to never forget that
[36:38] when you go through a dark time when you
[36:40] are questioning just get in the presence
[36:43] of God and he will quickly change your
[36:46] point of view amen hallelujah delivered
[36:50] us into the hands of the midianites why
[36:52] well we'll get into that I'm preaching
[36:54] my sermon here and the Lord looked upon
[36:56] him and said go in this thy might and
[37:00] thou shalt save Israel from the hand of
[37:02] the midianites have not I sent
[37:06] thee and I want you to remember God
[37:10] placed you here in this
[37:13] day you say but but I was born of a
[37:16] lineage of people that's right and God
[37:18] went through that lineage and said and
[37:20] right here is when I will deliver you
[37:25] placed amen Heavenly Father we thank you
[37:27] Lord Your Grace your mercy your kindness
[37:30] Lord let us come boldly before your
[37:32] throne today father let us come boldly
[37:35] not in the flesh but in the spirit Lord
[37:37] that we could come and walk out of this
[37:39] building today saying was it not good to
[37:41] be in the house of God today Father we
[37:44] thank you for your love your grace and
[37:46] mercy how father you have held us give
[37:48] us confidence to walk to live forgiven
[37:51] us of our shortcomings our failures
[37:53] father you wipe the mud from our face
[37:55] father when we have fallen and you do
[37:58] not look down upon us father you do not
[38:00] deride us but Lord you tell us to come
[38:02] boldly to your throne and father we come
[38:05] today trusting having confidence in your
[38:07] word and in the life that is contained
[38:10] father we thank you bless this time in
[38:12] the name of Jesus Christ amen God bless
[38:15] you Saints you may be
[38:25] seated as we look at this amen I believe
[38:27] it was read in the prayer requests I I
[38:30] guess I was a little mentally distracted
[38:32] but certainly remember our sister April
[38:35] and uh the things that's um taking place
[38:38] and and those that she is helping uh by
[38:41] God's grace the medical needs for people
[38:43] that have no other option so just
[38:46] continue to lift her up in
[38:49] prayer we live in a day and age my
[38:52] brother and sister as the scripture says
[38:55] there in verse 6 that Israel was greatly
[38:57] impoverished and we are my brother and
[39:00] sister living in a day a time that is
[39:04] spiritually impoverished it is the the
[39:07] goods now I think most of us would say
[39:09] you know I'd be happy if I had a little
[39:11] bit more money in the checking account
[39:14] or you know a little something of that
[39:17] uh but yet we live at least right here
[39:19] in this place we live in a a land and we
[39:23] truly are are blessed and often times
[39:26] we'll see how that
[39:27] uh denomination has kind of put an
[39:29] emphasis you know that you're going to
[39:31] have plenty of money that's God's sign
[39:33] of you being blessed well I'll tell you
[39:35] my brother and sister the sign of being
[39:37] blessed is having The Word Alive in our
[39:39] lives in our marriages in our our
[39:42] relationships our children uh in our
[39:45] church amen when we see God alive there
[39:48] there's where real blessing comes from
[39:50] and you know uh we live in a time of
[39:53] spiritual in in poverty uh we have more
[39:57] religion more churches than ever I was
[39:59] just watching a little uh clip of a
[40:03] church it's actually in akan Ohio and it
[40:06] was considered to be one of the original
[40:09] uh mega churches uh they had back in the
[40:12] 60s 5,000 people it was just an
[40:15] absolutely enormous uh uh building with
[40:18] all kinds of things radio station their
[40:20] own television stuff and it was just a
[40:23] place to be and as the years went on you
[40:26] would think you know a church that would
[40:29] attract that kind of attention in that
[40:31] many people but you know when asked why
[40:35] did this church uh uh uh go you know
[40:38] become impoverished and finally be
[40:40] completely abandoned and and people
[40:42] would come use comments like well they
[40:45] fell out of touch with uh uh the society
[40:49] they fell out of touch with um these
[40:52] things now I want you to understand this
[40:54] church would have been a huge Church in
[40:57] the days when the prophet of God was
[40:59] traveling through those areas so I I'm
[41:02] not pinpointing I don't believe there's
[41:04] anything in the message that focuses
[41:06] that way but I want to tell you my
[41:08] brother and sister that having listened
[41:11] to some of the sermons that were
[41:12] preached you would look at that and you
[41:14] would say well wait they were still
[41:17] preaching Baptist theology but still in
[41:20] those days good solid Theology and yet
[41:23] their reason is is it fell out of touch
[41:26] with the people but I want you to
[41:28] understand or use this as a a an
[41:31] expression today it was not so much as
[41:34] it were the church falling out in touch
[41:36] with the people but the people falling
[41:39] out in touch with God Amen so it's there
[41:43] that there was a decline you can follow
[41:45] that late 50s early 60s going very
[41:48] strong and I I hope you don't mind me
[41:51] making a parallel here but you know
[41:53] there was a time right in there that
[41:56] people started to declare that brother
[41:58] branham's Ministry was no longer
[42:00] relevant to the people and what did the
[42:03] prophet of God tell us there come a date
[42:05] a amen a time when it was America's last
[42:09] chance and and they turned it down and
[42:12] in turning it down they turned as it
[42:14] were a corner uh and and they turned
[42:17] away from God and and it wasn't just as
[42:20] it was touching brother bram's Ministry
[42:23] but you look and so this got me all kind
[42:25] of picked in my interest and I started
[42:28] searching uh out a few of churches that
[42:31] would be you might say in the same
[42:33] position and you can build or correlate
[42:36] a reaction across many churches in that
[42:40] time that they said were no longer
[42:42] relevant to the people but I tell you my
[42:45] brother and sister as we have by God's
[42:47] grace and mercy a Clear Vision into this
[42:50] we realize that when America turned that
[42:53] corner and turned down God it wasn't
[42:55] just a message it wasn't just a
[42:58] prophet's Ministry but it was a spirit
[43:00] that would have rolled like a fog as it
[43:02] were across the land and people said we
[43:05] got better things to do with our time
[43:07] than devote it to this we've got this
[43:10] God understands we can serve God however
[43:13] we want to but my brother and sister as
[43:15] we'll look today I I just wanted to
[43:17] preface it with that we'll look today
[43:19] and we'll see how that Israel amen God
[43:23] said I'll deliver you I'll provide for
[43:25] you I'll do this but yet the Judgment
[43:28] comes and says you know what you didn't
[43:31] do my
[43:32] word you did not follow my word you did
[43:35] not do what you were supposed to do amen
[43:39] and it's there that that they are are
[43:42] judging this as though God had forsaken
[43:45] them when the real reality is they
[43:48] forsook God oh God that Spirit can be so
[43:53] easy and creep in Even in our midst
[43:55] saints that we can be so preoccupied
[43:58] with life that if we're not careful we
[44:00] would be guilty I don't think that
[44:02] Israel got up one morning and said we're
[44:04] just going to turn away from God I
[44:06] believe it was so gradual they didn't
[44:08] even recognize the course change of
[44:10] their own life the course change of
[44:13] God's promised people and they changed
[44:16] the course and it become about them and
[44:18] about convenience and about all of the
[44:21] little things that made their life
[44:22] easier until they literally come and
[44:25] said well God you forsook us to let the
[44:28] midianites punish us my brother and
[44:31] sister they were punishing themselves if
[44:32] you want to be honest you want to look
[44:35] at and realize that they themselves were
[44:37] the ones that were hindering their own
[44:39] life because of the refusal to be
[44:42] obedient to the word of God and I lift
[44:44] my hand this morning and say Lord
[44:46] forgive me amen I want to be obedient to
[44:49] your voice I do not want another voice
[44:53] to come in and turn me from your word
[44:57] amen and how it led them a time that
[45:00] they were impoverished and they blamed
[45:02] it on the midianites but my brother and
[45:04] sister as we'll touch on this I'm going
[45:06] to I don't want to get ahead of myself I
[45:08] want to just stay in line here amen but
[45:10] look at this now an age that's
[45:12] spiritually impoverished but we have
[45:14] more religion more churches than
[45:17] ever
[45:19] amen I think I shared this in the Pulpit
[45:22] that uh uh people identifying as
[45:25] Christians and and what not is declining
[45:29] but yet there are more people that are
[45:31] connected to things that churches are
[45:34] more like clubs amen did the prophet of
[45:36] God uh he called them
[45:39] lodges we're seeing it fulfilled in this
[45:42] day Church good daycare good
[45:46] entertainment good sports
[45:48] League good social
[45:51] structure soft on the
[45:53] gospel but wait that's what the people
[45:56] want
[45:58] I'll feel welcome in Grace Tabernacle
[46:00] Saints when you have coffee and donuts
[46:02] in the
[46:03] foyer and I'll feel more comfortable
[46:06] when you have somebody out in the
[46:07] parking lot to open my car door for me
[46:09] and greet me to the service see not
[46:12] looking for good straight identifiable
[46:16] things that will get us in a Rapture but
[46:18] they're looking to what makes them feel
[46:20] good and and they call that unnecessary
[46:24] to grow your church well my brother and
[46:26] sister I don't care how many you have in
[46:29] numbers if they're all going to hell and
[46:31] pardon me for saying it that blunt if
[46:33] you're going to go with 10,000 people to
[46:36] hell my brother and sister it doesn't
[46:38] matter but I tell you I want to come be
[46:41] handin hand bonded together if there
[46:43] would be only one that was going to go
[46:45] for the Rapture let me be bonded to that
[46:48] one let us be bonded by the word of God
[46:51] together it's lonely
[46:57] it's
[47:00] lonely but the Lord said I'll be your
[47:03] peace I'll be your
[47:05] comforter he didn't say I'll give you
[47:07] thousands or tens of thousands to people
[47:09] to warm you up our brother step Hit Upon
[47:12] that and I I like that my brother and
[47:14] sister we can be lonely in the
[47:16] crowd but remember God called you out of
[47:20] the crowd you're not part of that crowd
[47:23] that crowd is not who you are we are
[47:25] Sons and Daughters of
[47:27] God Amen and the crowd sometimes is a
[47:30] false security we feel lonely in the
[47:33] crowd but we also feel safe in the
[47:37] crowd come on I I know I could give you
[47:39] a name of a brother who went to a church
[47:42] that you would know the name of very
[47:44] very well may know the church very very
[47:46] well and he went there and it wasn't
[47:49] until he left that church and ended up
[47:51] living with his family in a small Church
[47:54] where when you was preaching you thought
[47:56] the preacher was
[47:57] looking well it must have been a church
[47:59] about this
[48:01] size it appeared the preacher was
[48:03] looking at
[48:05] you and he said that's when I got a real
[48:07] experience with God because I couldn't
[48:10] hide when the preacher preached hard I I
[48:13] couldn't duck and it just get somebody
[48:16] else cuz everybody in the church would
[48:18] be like why are you
[48:20] ducking that must have been for you
[48:22] stand up and receive it but in that
[48:25] crowd you could hide but we're not here
[48:28] to hide amen Gideon you know the the the
[48:32] verses there in judges those coming down
[48:36] Gideon's hiding under the tree behind
[48:40] the rock of and by the wine press he's
[48:43] hiding to thrash out his wheat because
[48:46] that's the only way he has any security
[48:49] and did not realize this off topic but
[48:51] did not realize the whole time that God
[48:54] possessed The Rock he was hiding
[48:57] behind it was there that God said I'm
[48:59] going to come and meet you there Gideon
[49:01] in the day appointed and I'm going to
[49:03] give you a courage bowl like you never
[49:06] had before and in that my brother and
[49:08] sister impoverished and blaming it on
[49:10] the midianites but God come down and
[49:13] expose to Gideon his own weakness it
[49:17] never had anything to do with a
[49:19] midianite it was him himself unable to
[49:23] fully grasp all of the word for him in
[49:27] his day my brother and sister I should
[49:29] say for his family and him in his day
[49:33] but God in a few simple words he doesn't
[49:35] call him a coward he doesn't berate him
[49:37] he doesn't kick him out seat of the
[49:39] pants he says what I want you to do is
[49:42] start getting things right go bring me
[49:44] an
[49:45] offering we need to bring an offering I
[49:47] want to ask you today is the offering
[49:49] I'm talking about God God Abraham
[49:51] Lincoln on it or or you know George
[49:53] Washington or whatever it is my brother
[49:55] and sister no the offering he's wanting
[49:58] us to bring today and lay on the Rock is
[50:00] you and I and if we'll come and lay it
[50:03] on we'll find a courage bold like we
[50:05] never had before it will cause us to see
[50:08] the word in such an entirely different
[50:11] fashion amen you know we're living in an
[50:13] age and I'm just as guilty maybe more so
[50:16] than many of
[50:19] you we have more possessions than ever
[50:23] before and less peace
[50:29] why do we buy more
[50:30] stuff you say I need it no you
[50:35] don't amen you
[50:41] know we could go in a lot of avenues
[50:43] there we'll move on we have more
[50:46] knowledge of God but less
[50:50] relationship we can explain he was
[50:53] speaking in aramic here and maybe a word
[50:55] or two in the Greek and and this and
[50:57] then we can break this all down and and
[50:59] how this all worked and the motive and
[51:01] the reason behind it but we don't even
[51:04] know him so we're speaking for someone
[51:07] we don't even
[51:09] know well I tell you my brother and
[51:11] sister that just doesn't
[51:16] work and I say
[51:18] today I believe it's very parallel this
[51:20] why I'm preaching this I believe it's
[51:22] very parallel to the Book of Judges
[51:24] right here of what has happened and and
[51:26] we see Gideon in this
[51:29] position a lot of things he's talking
[51:32] about a God that has forsaken them you
[51:34] know what that tells you now my sound
[51:36] like I'm hammering on Gideon but my
[51:38] brother and sister this is actually you
[51:40] and I hid in the word right here and
[51:43] Gideon's saying God's forsaken me he's
[51:45] talking to God and he's telling him
[51:47] you've forsaken me but the truth of it
[51:50] is if they had followed God's word they
[51:53] wouldn't be under the leadership of the
[51:55] midianites god never forsook them they
[51:57] forsake forsook Him amen and you'll look
[52:01] I don't want to be labor that but you'll
[52:03] look at this my brother and sister what
[52:05] is happening amen and in seasons of
[52:08] preparation I don't know you know uh we
[52:11] all are in different stages right you go
[52:13] to school uh to learn things and then
[52:16] you go to advanced classes to you know
[52:19] learn about computers and and
[52:21] Technologies and mechanics and whatever
[52:25] it is and and sometimes we can learn on
[52:27] the job uh sometimes you have to have
[52:30] you know the the diploma but it's in
[52:33] times of preparation my brother and
[52:35] sister that prepares you actually for
[52:37] your future amen now my brother and
[52:41] sister so often we hear this in the
[52:43] world today they're like well you know
[52:45] uh don't judge
[52:46] me well I'll tell you my brother and
[52:49] sister that's good I I I'm actually a no
[52:51] judge person just have courage enough
[52:54] amen I I don't want to use my Idaho
[52:56] English have guts
[52:58] enough to judge
[53:01] yourself but when judgment appears we
[53:03] use this deal don't judge me don't judge
[53:06] me my life's a mess and and I I'm I'm
[53:10] happy with it but it's not my fault
[53:12] God's forsaken me I asked God to do this
[53:16] this this and this and it never happened
[53:18] so therefore it's not my fault it's
[53:21] God's fault my brother and sister God
[53:23] dealt with Gideon very directly and if
[53:26] we are Sons and Daughters of God he's
[53:28] going to deal with you and I very
[53:30] directly let's have enough courage to
[53:32] stand up and sayl you're right you're
[53:34] right I need to change my thinking you
[53:37] see God wasn't there to condemn Gideon
[53:39] he was there to change Gideon's thinking
[53:42] which in context was not change his mind
[53:45] but to change his heart and when God
[53:47] comes on the scene and starts to change
[53:49] a heart my brother and sister we sing
[53:51] the song I'm no longer a slave to fear
[53:54] amen my brother and sister we'll be no
[53:56] no longer a slave to our emotion our
[54:00] intellect our understanding but
[54:03] surrendered completely to the Lord to
[54:05] say Lord you're in control I want to ask
[54:07] you is that easy or hard it's hard it
[54:11] can be really hard amen so we look at
[54:16] this people feel as though God is
[54:18] judging them or people feel
[54:21] forsaken but will they when you come and
[54:24] present the antidote that's it receive
[54:28] it the prophet of God hits it once again
[54:32] here that's not what our church
[54:37] teaches and your church is all in the
[54:40] same condition you
[54:45] are
[54:48] Hallelujah hope I don't offend anybody
[54:50] but that's like saying I use honey
[54:52] because it's natural sweetener on my
[54:54] corn flakes
[54:59] still an empty
[55:02] diet John 3:16 God loves the whole world
[55:06] but a prophet laid it out very clearly
[55:08] the whole world doesn't love
[55:11] God and then they want to say God
[55:13] forsook
[55:15] us see how Satan has just convoluted
[55:19] this he's mixed it all up that we have
[55:21] problems we go out get paid spend all
[55:23] the money on junk and then say why can't
[55:26] can't the Lord provide we don't have
[55:27] groceries in our house come on my
[55:30] brother and sister have
[55:32] discipline have
[55:34] discipline amen yes
[55:36] stewardship so you know in the seasons
[55:39] of preparation people feel as though God
[55:41] is judging them or they feel forsaken
[55:44] but I tell you I want you this morning
[55:46] uh for the sake of time we we have
[55:48] limited this down but when you feel
[55:50] forsaken I want you to replace the
[55:53] thought of forsaken in your mind and
[55:55] replace it with
[55:57] preparation God has not forsaken me God
[56:01] is preparing me for something greater I
[56:05] must go through battle I must go through
[56:07] struggle I must go through strain I must
[56:09] come to the very borderline of defeat
[56:13] but God is actually teaching me how to
[56:16] be a real
[56:18] Soldier amen I tell you what I I
[56:20] remember many years ago just out of
[56:22] Interest sake uh there was a time in my
[56:25] life I come just whisker close to going
[56:27] in the military and um some ways it
[56:30] would have been good for me um but
[56:34] looking in some ways I'm glad I never
[56:37] but my brother and sister you know uh
[56:39] you can see him now just I don't know
[56:41] how much you've looked into this but you
[56:43] know they pull up to Paris Island and
[56:45] and the the recruits get off the bus and
[56:48] you know they hand them A coffee a soda
[56:50] Popa donut and they ask him if they will
[56:52] please come over here and stand in this
[56:54] certain spot
[57:00] yo get off there hustle test out get I
[57:06] said stand right there get your feet
[57:08] together and they're just like oh oh oh
[57:11] yeah yeah they can't touch them anymore
[57:14] but boy they can sure verbally touch
[57:17] them and these young men in this certain
[57:20] video here's this young man his own they
[57:23] allowed him to be interviewed and and he
[57:25] joined the army one to be in the Army
[57:26] wanted to be like Special Forces and
[57:29] wanted to be one of the best and he
[57:30] started a year before he actually went
[57:33] into the army doing push-ups and running
[57:36] and carrying Rock sacks full of rocks
[57:38] and he was just hard as a rock and and
[57:40] he had long hair during that time and he
[57:43] goes and he gets a haircut which he
[57:44] thought ah they won't cut my hair now
[57:47] and so as he's there you know the only
[57:49] problem he had he wasn't very good at
[57:51] listening he didn't train he had this
[57:54] body was Rock Solid just like I can do
[57:57] this but he never attuned his
[58:01] ears and that drill sergeant starts in
[58:03] on him and he does and he he basically
[58:07] brutalizes this young man and everything
[58:11] the young man does and finally one day
[58:15] he feels the drill sergeant feels sorry
[58:16] for this young man and he calls him to
[58:18] the side and this young man's terrified
[58:20] what are they going to do to me
[58:22] now and he just in very blunt language
[58:26] son if you'll just listen and do what I
[58:32] tell
[58:35] you I thought I was
[58:37] Sir no you studied too much
[58:41] Army before you got in the
[58:44] Army and you are in the army of your own
[58:50] thinking that young man pondered it and
[58:53] in the end of the deal he said you know
[58:56] some of the shame that come I had paid
[58:59] you know this back a few years but he
[59:01] had paid top dollar for the perfect
[59:04] haircut and when he's going through the
[59:06] line the man cutting hair you know I
[59:09] don't know if he was just Discerning of
[59:11] it or was revenge or what but it's there
[59:14] he said and as I was there the guy takes
[59:17] off the little
[59:20] deal and he said it was about that thick
[59:23] and he puts on one that was about that
[59:25] thick and I thought he was peeling my
[59:30] head and then the guy smiles at him and
[59:34] says now you've got an army
[59:38] haircut now my brother and sister it
[59:41] appeared that this young man was doing
[59:43] everything
[59:44] correct but it's not correct until it's
[59:47] like God wants it that's it to
[59:51] be right not me just fitting inside I
[59:56] believe God sent a prophet amen the
[59:58] devil believes that that's right amen
[1:00:00] there's a lot of people whose lives well
[1:00:02] I'm just going to be blunt this morning
[1:00:03] if you don't mind their lives stink and
[1:00:05] they believe God sent a prophet amen is
[1:00:08] that too blunt amen hallelujah brother
[1:00:12] Chris preached Wednesday night said if
[1:00:14] you guys just knew what my day was like
[1:00:16] well let me just tell you if you knew
[1:00:17] what my Saturday was like you would have
[1:00:19] said let's get somebody a little happier
[1:00:21] to preach on Sunday but I tell you my
[1:00:23] brother and sister what it is it's not
[1:00:25] what we are judging Gideon was looking
[1:00:28] at the whole situation saying this is
[1:00:30] what God did and this is what God done
[1:00:33] and this is never looking at himself but
[1:00:35] God come down God rich in Mercy can
[1:00:37] somebody say that this morning God rich
[1:00:39] in Mercy come down and said Gideon I'm
[1:00:43] going to change your point of view I'm
[1:00:46] going to get you to look at my word and
[1:00:48] look at this whole situation in a
[1:00:50] different light and when Gideon I'm
[1:00:52] jumping ahead of myself but when Gideon
[1:00:54] realized that that rock right there was
[1:00:57] Christ was right in his very midst the
[1:00:59] whole time cuz the fire it was not a
[1:01:02] magician's trick the fire come from The
[1:01:05] Rock Amen and when you realize the rock
[1:01:08] is with us the rock is present we don't
[1:01:11] have to look in history to find God in
[1:01:13] the rock my brother and sister he's
[1:01:15] right here this morning in our
[1:01:18] presence
[1:01:20] amen and we'll see
[1:01:23] this time of preparation
[1:01:27] don't think forsaken think
[1:01:30] preparation God's got an army aren't you
[1:01:33] glad to be in that Army amen if my hair
[1:01:36] needs to be long Let It Be Long if my
[1:01:38] hair needs to be short let it be short
[1:01:40] if I need to be proper respectful
[1:01:43] present myself in a certain way man or
[1:01:45] woman brother or sister then Lord let me
[1:01:48] find the balance on that I can present
[1:01:51] myself you want more out of me Lord I'm
[1:01:53] not going to complain I'll give you more
[1:01:55] and amen because I am I recognize I am
[1:02:00] what the I am said I am amen I'm not of
[1:02:04] this world I'm not of Leo deia I am the
[1:02:07] bride of Christ that's what my Bible
[1:02:10] says amen that's when I hear when I hear
[1:02:13] the message I'm not a buzzard my brother
[1:02:16] and sister I'm an eagle Can someone say
[1:02:19] Amen this morning I'm not a buzzard I
[1:02:22] won't look at the word as though God's
[1:02:24] calling me a buzzard I look at an eagle
[1:02:27] that's being taught to fly being taught
[1:02:30] well start with right got to eat the
[1:02:32] meat amen then you got to grow some
[1:02:34] feathers and you got to learn to fly and
[1:02:37] then you got to learn to feed
[1:02:41] yourself not Buzzard
[1:02:44] food amen not
[1:02:47] carrying meat not milk
[1:02:51] meat am I preaching too hard to you this
[1:02:54] morning he
[1:02:56] amen hallelujah you know think
[1:02:59] preparation great battle coming and we
[1:03:02] can see the angel of the Lord which
[1:03:04] brother Brown says in this sermon was
[1:03:06] God
[1:03:07] himself now Gideon while you're hiding
[1:03:10] behind this Rock Amen you're going into
[1:03:13] Warfare
[1:03:14] Gideon what I need you to do is just
[1:03:17] start simple 25
[1:03:19] push-ups and the branch on this tree
[1:03:21] you're under while you're hiding behind
[1:03:23] the rock just start with 20 five
[1:03:26] chinups and then you need to find the
[1:03:29] heaviest sword you can find and start
[1:03:32] swinging that thing cuz there certain
[1:03:34] muscles that are contained with swinging
[1:03:36] this sword and then Gideon I need you to
[1:03:39] just start being bold did you remember
[1:03:42] reading
[1:03:44] that just
[1:03:47] as I
[1:03:49] am without one please
[1:03:57] some spiritual muscle was
[1:04:02] necessary maybe something on the order
[1:04:06] of I can I will I do believe I can I
[1:04:13] will I do
[1:04:16] believe you
[1:04:17] see the Lord's dealing with
[1:04:20] Gideon and he's preparing him amen what
[1:04:24] was he doing now often times we want to
[1:04:26] be so spiritual that we think the state
[1:04:28] of our mind has nothing to do with it
[1:04:30] but I'll tell you my brother and sister
[1:04:32] it has a lot to do with it you come with
[1:04:34] a state of mind that says that's God's
[1:04:36] word I'm going to say Amen to it that
[1:04:38] state of mind even in your darkest
[1:04:40] moments will cause you to say that's
[1:04:43] God's word and I'll say Amen to it or if
[1:04:45] you're over here with a nice little
[1:04:47] theological point of view we'll be
[1:04:50] saying well I I don't know if that's the
[1:04:52] correct interpretation amen there's this
[1:04:54] Theologian over here that says this and
[1:04:57] there's one that says this and there's
[1:04:59] another one that proves the fault of
[1:05:01] this one and you know oh lamza he had
[1:05:03] this idea you know and scoffield had
[1:05:06] this idea I don't know where I stand I
[1:05:09] think I'll get the one that puts it into
[1:05:10] modernday water down theology cuz I feel
[1:05:13] better when I read
[1:05:16] it then you have preachers stand up and
[1:05:18] say well praise God in this church he's
[1:05:21] talking to a couple thousand people any
[1:05:24] translation of the Bible is good enough
[1:05:27] for
[1:05:28] us said the
[1:05:32] devil but what was God doing he was
[1:05:34] taking Gideon back remember
[1:05:38] Gideon I delivered you guys out of
[1:05:41] Egypt remember Gideon I did this
[1:05:45] remember Gideon I did this maybe it
[1:05:49] would do us good you know often times
[1:05:51] we're so forward thinking maybe it would
[1:05:53] be good maybe we could stop preaching
[1:05:55] preaching right now and just
[1:05:58] stop now you guys might think I'm off my
[1:06:01] rocker but I think if we really had
[1:06:03] prayed up before we come to church and
[1:06:04] we stopped right now and started
[1:06:06] thinking about what just what God has
[1:06:08] done we're talking past tense we would
[1:06:10] be in the altar weeping to think that
[1:06:13] God loved us so much that he took us
[1:06:15] through this brought us over here
[1:06:18] wouldn't allow us to be deceived here
[1:06:20] give us courage when we were weak and
[1:06:22] brought us I think we'd fill an altar up
[1:06:24] of people saying thank you Lord for what
[1:06:27] you've done for me I was lost but now
[1:06:31] I'm found I had no understanding but
[1:06:34] you've given me Revelation I had
[1:06:36] bitterness in my heart and no love and
[1:06:39] you've come taken the bitterness and
[1:06:41] place love down in my life amen come on
[1:06:45] Saints maybe I'm either crazy or off my
[1:06:47] rocker but I'm telling you it really
[1:06:50] should impact us but instead we're say I
[1:06:52] leave the past in the past we are so
[1:06:54] spiritual we've moved on into Revelation
[1:06:58] one of those Revelation is is you need
[1:07:00] God Amen you need a liberal dose of the
[1:07:03] Holy Ghost cuz that old Spirit of
[1:07:06] bitterness that's is just outside the
[1:07:09] door
[1:07:10] amen that old Spirit of
[1:07:13] temper just outside the
[1:07:17] door go ahead and run the alphab in your
[1:07:20] own mind of what these things would be
[1:07:22] and he delivered you amen he called you
[1:07:26] from that that should be sufficient
[1:07:28] enough in every day of our life to get
[1:07:31] up in the morning and say thank you Lord
[1:07:34] thank you Lord for what you brought me
[1:07:36] from Lord I know you got higher Heights
[1:07:39] for me you've got greater things for me
[1:07:41] Lord but I'm telling you this morning
[1:07:44] thank you for what you've
[1:07:47] done instead we get so spiritual we
[1:07:50] forget what we were and we're trying so
[1:07:52] hard to become something we think we are
[1:07:55] that's and when I say that you'd say
[1:07:57] well aren't we the bride of Christ yes
[1:08:00] but I want to know do we have a clear
[1:08:01] picture of what the bride is that's it
[1:08:03] no no I'm not preaching to you sisters
[1:08:05] about being in
[1:08:07] subjection but the
[1:08:09] bride does just as Jesus said I only do
[1:08:13] what my father shows me amen the bride
[1:08:16] of Christ little different verbiage I
[1:08:20] only do what my husband amen shows me
[1:08:25] amen
[1:08:26] one of the greatest challenges is Spirit
[1:08:28] of the age I tell you what there's
[1:08:30] nothing like being around natural people
[1:08:32] that you know and the man making a
[1:08:35] comment and the wife cutting him off and
[1:08:37] telling him you're wrong and this is how
[1:08:39] the cow eat the cabbage and then watch a
[1:08:42] man that could pick me up bust me like a
[1:08:44] twig get just
[1:08:46] embarrassed cow toow back out of that
[1:08:50] conversation that's the spirit of leod
[1:08:53] deia let's not let that spirit in the
[1:08:55] church let's not live our spiritual life
[1:08:59] amen trying to tell God how to do this
[1:09:02] but to be submitted and say Lord if you
[1:09:04] want me to how you want me to be take it
[1:09:07] in the spiritual sense I'm not talking
[1:09:09] the natural you can take it in the
[1:09:10] natural your ownself we should know amen
[1:09:13] but we got to get in the right state of
[1:09:15] mind and that's a state of mind where no
[1:09:18] matter how this amalgamation of several
[1:09:21] things I've studied in the last few days
[1:09:23] H but we got to come to the place that
[1:09:25] if God says yes we say thank you Lord
[1:09:27] and if he says no we say thank you Lord
[1:09:31] if he says the timing's not right then
[1:09:34] we say Lord show me when the time is
[1:09:37] right and if he says
[1:09:40] never then we say Lord never that's
[1:09:46] right or we can have a balum spirit say
[1:09:49] Now list God said no but I didn't word
[1:09:53] it like this okay now now um I'm coming
[1:09:56] around here like this and you know um
[1:09:59] Israel's been
[1:10:01] backslid you know there's some backslid
[1:10:04] people in Grace Tabernacle so we should
[1:10:06] just preach to everybody that you're
[1:10:08] going to
[1:10:12] hell Bo I'm
[1:10:18] encouraged cuz if I preach that
[1:10:20] everyone's going to go in the Rapture
[1:10:22] some people are going to think their
[1:10:24] life is just just
[1:10:29] fine the Book of Judges has already been
[1:10:32] written and God will let us know if he
[1:10:34] wants us to be the
[1:10:39] judge but the word preached in
[1:10:42] truth is God's judg amen
[1:10:45] amen you see not me
[1:10:48] thinking poor
[1:10:51] Titus
[1:10:53] Titus you would have looked like a nice
[1:10:56] Christian young man if you to use that
[1:10:57] glue
[1:11:01] stuff it gets that silly Saints and I'm
[1:11:05] presenting it to you in that silly
[1:11:09] fashion I don't know the wife probably
[1:11:11] wasn't very happy with me we were up
[1:11:13] there in Canada you know and I was
[1:11:14] joking to the young people about come on
[1:11:17] what do we have for church and I said
[1:11:19] you know oh oh the sister has heels here
[1:11:22] uh well um anyway we don't have our heal
[1:11:25] automatic heel measuring and cutting
[1:11:27] device installed
[1:11:30] yet so you don't need a deacon or
[1:11:32] preacher to judgey you just walk into
[1:11:34] church stand on the two Footprints and
[1:11:36] the light's either green or it's red and
[1:11:38] if it's red it clamps down on your shoe
[1:11:42] and and then you can walk into
[1:11:44] church okay is that the gospel that we
[1:11:49] have is that what God did with with
[1:11:52] Gideon no God comes Gideon hiding not
[1:11:57] bold as a Believer hiding and he says oh
[1:12:01] mighty man of
[1:12:03] Val oh Mighty Man Valor Gideon's like
[1:12:06] whoo that's the wrong guy yeah you're
[1:12:09] not talking and God doesn't give up
[1:12:10] there and say yeah maybe I did what God
[1:12:12] does he starts telling Gideon how he's
[1:12:15] going to lead the people and I want to
[1:12:18] tell you it's in the right context okay
[1:12:20] don't take this out of context but every
[1:12:22] one of you has been called to be a
[1:12:24] leader amen every one of us has
[1:12:27] influence on someone around us make a
[1:12:29] difference in their life God's not going
[1:12:31] to come and cut us down and pound us to
[1:12:33] dirt and then try to build us up in the
[1:12:36] sense of oh look see now that's how it's
[1:12:37] done because in the human element we'll
[1:12:39] take that and apply it to the next
[1:12:42] person and the next
[1:12:44] person now don't mistake this for
[1:12:47] hearing the gospel preached okay well
[1:12:50] the preacher can't preach hard because
[1:12:52] no no no get that out of your mind this
[1:12:54] is how God comes and deals at the right
[1:12:57] time and the right place to cause each
[1:13:00] one of us to realize there's more in
[1:13:04] me Gideon walked out of that experience
[1:13:08] rooted he wasn't like should I hide from
[1:13:10] the midianites no God said you're going
[1:13:12] to lead the people and you're going to
[1:13:14] overcome the enemy you're going to do
[1:13:16] what my word said I chose you Gideon and
[1:13:19] I want to say this morning with a
[1:13:20] boldness God chose you this morning to
[1:13:23] walk out with a boldness to show the
[1:13:26] world how to overcome the spirits of
[1:13:29] this age how to be an overcomer without
[1:13:31] it being a judgmental I remember as
[1:13:33] young man you got to love this amen I I
[1:13:36] remember as a young man you know the
[1:13:37] preaching that we grew up in and we're
[1:13:39] one time sitting I was working doing
[1:13:41] construction work with a brother we're
[1:13:43] sitting in a cafe and a a man comes in
[1:13:45] that he knew it and before the
[1:13:47] conversation's over the man I was with
[1:13:49] has told this guy you got to repent or
[1:13:52] perish or serpent seed you're going to
[1:13:54] hell and I'm just sitting there with my
[1:13:57] eyelashes and and just everything is
[1:13:59] just smoldering I'm just
[1:14:02] like wow I might just go around the
[1:14:05] other side of this booth and sit down on
[1:14:07] his side and say who are
[1:14:10] you but you see God didn't do that but
[1:14:13] he brought Gideon to a place that when
[1:14:16] Gideon finally stood before the people
[1:14:18] they didn't see Gideon The
[1:14:22] Hider they saw Gideon a mighty man of
[1:14:28] Valor enough so that they said we'll
[1:14:30] follow this man when he says we'll do
[1:14:34] and I'm ahead of myself and way off
[1:14:36] track but let me tell you it not fun it
[1:14:39] not fun it not
[1:14:41] fun it not fun yes
[1:14:48] anyway
[1:14:50] okay it's not fun imagine how Gideon
[1:14:54] felt after you might say recruiting all
[1:14:57] of these
[1:14:58] men and they get down to the
[1:15:04] brook did he say you're not
[1:15:09] worthy
[1:15:11] no but he had to have the courage to
[1:15:14] tell him you're not passing the
[1:15:18] test
[1:15:20] dividing division's never fun
[1:15:25] till you've stood in the pulpit and
[1:15:26] you've you've had to preach things that
[1:15:27] were very very hard very straight you
[1:15:30] don't know the feeling of what it is to
[1:15:32] know this is going to hurt these
[1:15:35] people's
[1:15:38] feelings but remember did Gideon do the
[1:15:42] dividing God did the
[1:15:44] dividing but Gideon rooted in God's
[1:15:47] promise the people saw this was
[1:15:50] necessary and Gideon himself no doubt
[1:15:53] said Lord why this guy right here is way
[1:15:55] better with a spear than I am this guy's
[1:15:57] way better with a sword than I am this
[1:15:59] guy's right here more mentally tough and
[1:16:02] more physically tough than I and God
[1:16:04] said no no I want the people that I want
[1:16:07] amen I want the people that are going to
[1:16:09] be able to do what I ask him to stand in
[1:16:14] that spot
[1:16:17] amen
[1:16:19] hallelujah now the thinning of the ranks
[1:16:22] depresses us let's be honest
[1:16:25] and maybe if it doesn't depress you I
[1:16:27] I'll just stand before you and say it
[1:16:28] depresses me when I see people leave the
[1:16:30] church especially leave serving the lord
[1:16:34] it just house this just very hard I feel
[1:16:37] beaten feeling over this but then we
[1:16:40] realize right here in scripture we see a
[1:16:42] time that God says you know what we got
[1:16:44] to thin this now brother Brown says uh
[1:16:47] in the sermon have not I sent thee he
[1:16:49] says then after he got ready to act he
[1:16:52] gave him so many thousand he says
[1:16:53] there's too many cowards in here that's
[1:16:56] prettyy straight talk just kept on kept
[1:16:59] on hone them down cuz he got them that
[1:17:02] was that God had called for see that's
[1:17:05] what God was looking for my brother and
[1:17:07] sister we're not going to decide oursel
[1:17:09] who is and who isn't you're not rooted
[1:17:11] in the word you're out my brother and
[1:17:13] sister their season of rooting might
[1:17:15] well be right there at the very
[1:17:17] threshold and we would judging the flesh
[1:17:19] they're not
[1:17:21] solid not our job let God do the thing
[1:17:26] let the word do the thinning see
[1:17:29] sometimes when we see things going wrong
[1:17:31] dropping off maybe as God is just
[1:17:33] getting an army ready that's
[1:17:38] all well the prophet of God didn't you
[1:17:40] say something about like after you've
[1:17:42] had to build two or three new churches
[1:17:44] because you've outgrown them all that
[1:17:46] that's a sign that God's
[1:17:48] present No in fact the prophet of God
[1:17:50] said you'll see him shrink that's right
[1:17:53] scriptural type right here here see it
[1:17:56] shrink cuz God's getting those he wants
[1:17:59] ready amen some don't want to be ready
[1:18:03] some studied how to be in the Army and
[1:18:06] they want the Army to be like they
[1:18:07] thought it should
[1:18:10] be praise the
[1:18:14] Lord let me read that again sometimes
[1:18:16] when we see things going wrong dropping
[1:18:19] off maybe God is just getting an army
[1:18:21] ready that's all or some Fighters ready
[1:18:24] you can never tell God he was ready to
[1:18:27] act amen now this talking about back
[1:18:28] Gideon he was ready to act and when he
[1:18:30] saw the Living Word of God he was ready
[1:18:32] to act upon it amen amen that's the kind
[1:18:35] of people that God's looking for he's
[1:18:37] looking for the Gideon type of people
[1:18:40] that are going to say if this is what
[1:18:42] God wants us to do here's the word I
[1:18:45] know it's the word I've Vindicated it
[1:18:47] I've proven it in the word act on it
[1:18:50] amen but what about tomorrow let God
[1:18:52] take care of tomorrow amen
[1:18:56] when you when we see God living in his
[1:18:59] word then let's be ready to act upon it
[1:19:03] imagine showing up to a fight in those
[1:19:06] days they didn't bring a spear a bow a
[1:19:11] sword they've got a beach unella and a
[1:19:16] container hey Gideon I heard you're
[1:19:19] taking us down by the river
[1:19:28] yeah I don't think you're one of them
[1:19:30] that we that was
[1:19:32] called
[1:19:34] amen how come our church doesn't have a
[1:19:36] fellowship every Sunday how come we
[1:19:38] don't this how come we don't that
[1:19:41] why what Warfare are you
[1:19:46] in what
[1:19:48] Warfare come
[1:19:50] on what
[1:19:52] Warfare but we see God living in his
[1:19:55] word I I I just you lift your hands if
[1:19:58] you want to but I want to ask you have
[1:20:00] you seen God living in his word amen
[1:20:02] when you see God living in his word then
[1:20:05] let's be ready that means you and I we
[1:20:07] see him living let you and I be ready
[1:20:10] that's our part amen hallelujah I can
[1:20:14] see some of you almost looking at me
[1:20:15] like oh man Paul I wanted to be preached
[1:20:18] happy today you know what happened when
[1:20:21] I told Brother Steven to preach us happy
[1:20:23] on Sunday morning
[1:20:25] he just laughed at me and Saidi going to
[1:20:28] preach what God showed
[1:20:32] me yeah I think that was the right
[1:20:34] result but you see I was right also
[1:20:37] because I knew if he preached what God
[1:20:39] showed him I would be happy amen
[1:20:43] right I did have a problem with his deal
[1:20:46] about you know being in the spirit
[1:20:48] meaning you had moved to
[1:20:50] Arizona I have to admit I had a problem
[1:20:52] with that Doctrine
[1:20:54] but anyway we'll overcome
[1:20:59] that
[1:21:00] so Gideon speaking these
[1:21:04] words where are all the Miracles where's
[1:21:07] all the Miracles do any of you have a
[1:21:09] challenge in your life I want to ask you
[1:21:11] is there any Giants that roam around
[1:21:13] your
[1:21:15] neighborhood H come on can we be honest
[1:21:18] with ourselves we got Giants in our
[1:21:20] neighborhood amen the challenges of our
[1:21:23] day
[1:21:24] yes you know what Satan wants you to do
[1:21:27] he wants you to forget all the Giants
[1:21:31] he's already taken care of as though
[1:21:35] this new
[1:21:36] giant is
[1:21:38] greater than any giant you ever
[1:21:44] faced and I heard a brother preach it
[1:21:46] this way once he said well you know as
[1:21:47] we get closer to the Rapture the Giants
[1:21:49] are getting
[1:21:51] bigger and that he just leaves it that
[1:21:53] and goes on and I felt like saying you
[1:21:56] know what if the Giant's getting bigger
[1:21:58] my faith is even bigger than it was
[1:22:01] before because there's no way this
[1:22:03] leodan Giant's going to be bigger than
[1:22:06] my faith amen so if you want to say the
[1:22:10] Giants are bigger than ever well my
[1:22:12] brother and sister the prophet of God
[1:22:13] said it's the same
[1:22:16] spirits come on think about it same
[1:22:19] Spirits doesn't say they're greater just
[1:22:21] says there's more of them right right so
[1:22:25] it's not the the giant is not any bigger
[1:22:27] than Goliath was there's just more
[1:22:30] Goliath in the land but hey we already
[1:22:33] defeated Goliath amen we did are you
[1:22:35] with me we already defeated Goliath amen
[1:22:39] and if another one shows up tomorrow
[1:22:41] morning and he probably will amen you'll
[1:22:43] defeat him too and he might show up
[1:22:45] tomorrow afternoon and you'll defeat him
[1:22:47] also amen and nothing will change
[1:22:50] because greater is he that is in you
[1:22:53] than he that is in the world means that
[1:22:55] you are a giant
[1:22:57] slayer not one giant not two giants
[1:23:01] every
[1:23:02] giant
[1:23:04] amen
[1:23:06] hallelujah see now look here as we go
[1:23:09] forward amen the challenges of our days
[1:23:12] what Satan's trying to do is get you to
[1:23:14] forget what God's already done for
[1:23:17] you what I what I brought out to you
[1:23:20] before I I feel that strongly in my
[1:23:23] heart I don't live in the past or do my
[1:23:25] very best not to live in the
[1:23:27] past but you see I don't want to forget
[1:23:31] where I came
[1:23:32] from I don't dwell on what happened when
[1:23:36] I came from
[1:23:37] Egypt but I want to remember and never
[1:23:39] forget there was a time in my life I
[1:23:42] lived Like An
[1:23:44] Egyptian but I'm not an Egyptian and I'm
[1:23:48] not going back to Egypt and I'm not
[1:23:50] going to hold on to the tradition and
[1:23:52] the culture of Egypt I have a Promised
[1:23:55] Land it takes a promised people to
[1:23:58] occupy a Promised Land amen hallelujah
[1:24:02] well you know I'm getting off track here
[1:24:04] but look what happened my brother and
[1:24:05] sister every time Israel was supposed to
[1:24:08] kill everything in the land and they
[1:24:11] felt sorry for that cute little baby now
[1:24:13] don't go into your
[1:24:15] Humanity go don't go into How could
[1:24:17] somebody have have have done that my
[1:24:20] brother and
[1:24:21] sister I want you to take that bring
[1:24:23] that forward let's make it simple I
[1:24:25] don't want to explain it make it simple
[1:24:28] when the Devil comes and he puts a
[1:24:31] little something on us God comes starts
[1:24:34] dealing with
[1:24:36] us well you know the only time I
[1:24:40] lie is when money's
[1:24:46] involved personal relationships never
[1:24:49] would lie things of this and things of
[1:24:51] that never would lie but I pay tithes on
[1:24:55] my
[1:24:57] profits silly analogy isn't
[1:25:00] it God said every Giant in your
[1:25:06] life giant over money giant over temper
[1:25:11] giant over whatever it is he said slay
[1:25:15] everything in the land amen and the
[1:25:18] reason is is we don't my brother and
[1:25:19] sister you go for I I dealt with a
[1:25:21] brother visiting Minister sometimes you
[1:25:23] wonder why don't they talk talked to a
[1:25:24] pastor about it I dealt with a brother
[1:25:27] and he said brother Paul what you
[1:25:29] preached today in the service he said
[1:25:32] just I know it was just for
[1:25:34] me I thought 25 years ago I had overcome
[1:25:41] this certain
[1:25:43] issue and he said just a few weeks
[1:25:47] ago there it
[1:25:49] is now I'm you know me I'm not overly
[1:25:52] right I'd say just about everybody in
[1:25:54] this room smarter than I am but there
[1:25:57] are a few things the Lord teaches you
[1:25:59] that's right and my first question was
[1:26:02] brother when that came back what did you
[1:26:07] do oh he said I wept and I wept I
[1:26:09] thought Lord all these years I haven't
[1:26:12] had the Holy
[1:26:16] Ghost go back into the principles the
[1:26:18] prophet teaches
[1:26:20] us the birds are flying over
[1:26:26] do you figure out how to keep all the
[1:26:28] birds from flying
[1:26:31] over no you find
[1:26:37] something to keep them from building
[1:26:41] that's right a nest amen
[1:26:43] amen I said the only problem you had
[1:26:46] brother is you was so confident in your
[1:26:50] flesh you forgot to take and wave
[1:26:55] that to keep them from building the
[1:26:58] nest and when you were out there saying
[1:27:01] now Birds can't build Nest I'm I've
[1:27:03] overcome this no sir can anybody relate
[1:27:07] to that Lord help me I got to keep it
[1:27:11] handy though you know when I get home
[1:27:13] from vacation I'll go find my Bible and
[1:27:15] wave it over my head no you you better
[1:27:17] take it on vacation with you you better
[1:27:20] take it on work with you you better take
[1:27:22] it on whatever with you now that way
[1:27:24] when those birds come flying over you
[1:27:26] can just say Lord that's just the devil
[1:27:29] and I know it is and so over this Temple
[1:27:32] of the Holy Ghost I apply the word
[1:27:34] here's the blood here's the blood now
[1:27:36] I'm off track and time is waning
[1:27:40] amen
[1:27:42] hallelujah I want to ask you what kind
[1:27:44] of Miracles you know uh Gideon said you
[1:27:46] know and where's all the Miracles I want
[1:27:48] to ask you what kind of Miracles are you
[1:27:50] looking
[1:27:51] for well we're looking for some speaking
[1:27:54] in tongues well that's not really a
[1:27:55] miracle but kind of fits in there for
[1:27:57] most people CU it's a miracle if they
[1:27:59] ever did speak in tongues uh but um oh
[1:28:02] oh we're looking for this and we're
[1:28:04] looking for this and we're looking for
[1:28:06] this do you know that a miracle can be
[1:28:09] what you oh somebody will choke on this
[1:28:12] a miracle can be what you want it to be
[1:28:15] cuz if you don't think so my brother and
[1:28:17] sister I've seen people that live like
[1:28:19] the devil but fell over speaking tongues
[1:28:22] and it's a miracle and they just live
[1:28:24] like the devil and say this is the Holy
[1:28:26] Ghost it's a miracle they can't figure
[1:28:28] that
[1:28:33] out it's a miracle he says where's all
[1:28:37] the Miracles our fathers told us Young
[1:28:39] People sisters young ladies young men

[1:28:44] message being the truth going to talk
[1:28:46] about how it changed our lives and you
[1:28:49] might look at us you might look at your
[1:28:51] parents you might look at me as pastor
[1:28:53] and say well sometimes you know they
[1:28:55] this grumpy and this and that and
[1:28:57] whatever the deal is you know uh what
[1:29:00] what what kind of Miracle is this but
[1:29:02] you see what it's got to come down to of
[1:29:05] the miracle of you and Christ amen my
[1:29:09] brother and sister you see there's
[1:29:11] Miracles already taking place around us
[1:29:13] and you say well what is it well I'll
[1:29:15] tell you what it is it might not be the
[1:29:17] kind of miracle that a lot of Believers
[1:29:18] are looking for but when the Devil comes
[1:29:21] in like a flood why are you you still
[1:29:25] standing in an age that there's nothing
[1:29:27] but corruption and demons around us and
[1:29:30] he comes in like a flood why are you
[1:29:31] still standing it's a
[1:29:34] miracle amen the devil would like to
[1:29:37] light you on
[1:29:40] fire isn't interesting God Drew these
[1:29:42] right out of out of the Old Testament
[1:29:44] brought them right into our day when the
[1:29:46] devil would like to light you on fire
[1:29:48] and we live in an age that being lit on
[1:29:50] fire is not too hard amen but what
[1:29:52] happens he comes and he quenches every
[1:29:55] fiery Dart of the enemy and we stand
[1:29:58] here right here a miracle that we're not
[1:30:00] burnt up right a miracle that the spirit
[1:30:03] of leoa has not burnt us up amen
[1:30:07] hallelujah so Miracles are taking place
[1:30:10] amen hallelujah the Lord meeting you in
[1:30:12] that fiery trial you see unbelief opens
[1:30:15] the door to defeat I didn't bring the
[1:30:17] quote and it's on my phone but I I
[1:30:20] didn't bring it out here but I tell you
[1:30:22] what my brother and sister you talk
[1:30:24] about the tomb so many things that come
[1:30:26] out of that the prophet of God using an
[1:30:28] analogy and bringing this out of the
[1:30:30] Tomb my brother and sister and he says
[1:30:33] God would like to get in there this
[1:30:34] paraphrasing like God would like to get
[1:30:36] in there but you have to roll the stone
[1:30:41] back wait I want God to roll the stone
[1:30:43] back and deliver me no you got to roll
[1:30:45] the stone back for him to get
[1:30:48] in you can't bar the door that's right
[1:30:53] right
[1:30:57] Amen brother brandham says the same
[1:31:01] sermon he said talking about Noah uh
[1:31:03] here again I'm paraphrasing it you must
[1:31:05] have an action to see the word in action
[1:31:09] Noah had to build an ark and the
[1:31:11] building of the Ark and the completion
[1:31:13] of the
[1:31:15] Ark was actually part of the time piece
[1:31:18] of the rainf

[1:31:23] to see the bright of
[1:31:25] Christ behold the bridegroom

[1:31:44] word in action amen cu the word says
[1:31:48] that that that foolish virgin she runs

[1:32:20] the real
[1:32:21] bride behold the bridegroom come
[1:32:24] now I hope you don't mind but I think
[1:32:27] there'll be just a few people that grab
[1:32:29] their bag and get out the door headed
[1:32:32] down the walk

[1:33:13] ark amen much less fill it but now look
[1:33:16] at this so brother Brown says that the
[1:33:18] word must have you must have an action
[1:33:21] to see the word in action so God's
[1:33:23] timing perfect and I want to use a
[1:33:25] counter type there lot and his family

[1:34:37] did or
[1:34:38] not but Miracle is
[1:34:41] Supernatural but it's also an
[1:34:45] extraordinary and welcomed
[1:34:51] event I came to church this
[1:34:54] morning happy to be in the church today
[1:34:58] extraordinarily happy to be in church
[1:35:01] today praise God I just witnessed a
[1:35:07] miracle did any of you witness a miracle
[1:35:10] this
[1:35:12] morning extraordinarily happy to be in
[1:35:16] the house of God might change our point
[1:35:19] of view right might change our point of
[1:35:23] of
[1:35:26] you h i could elaborate here but I want
[1:35:29] to do but let me just throw this out
[1:35:31] it's not about fishes and loav
[1:35:34] Saints it's not about it's not about
[1:35:38] plain simple I think about what brother
[1:35:39] Adrian preached to us if we're not
[1:35:42] eating the whole word of God we we're
[1:35:45] missing it you might say Brother Paul's
[1:35:48] not not preaching anything of depth
[1:35:51] today he's just hitting on all these
[1:35:53] little highlights
[1:35:54] well you know my brother and sister them
[1:35:56] fragments that those people picked up at
[1:36:01] Jesus
[1:36:01] command they didn't look like much did
[1:36:04] they till they came to the right person
[1:36:07] that said that's what I'm looking for
[1:36:11] that's what I need that's the word
[1:36:14] that's been missing because I'll tell
[1:36:15] you our our family's own own deal the
[1:36:19] Methodist Church back in those days when
[1:36:20] my parents come in the message the
[1:36:22] Methodist Church back in them days days
[1:36:24] preached the word pretty
[1:36:26] straight but they didn't have the
[1:36:29] fragment that made the
[1:36:31] difference and that fragment come to my
[1:36:35] mom and
[1:36:36] dad and they said this is so good it's
[1:36:41] what we were looking
[1:36:43] [Music]
[1:36:45] for it's about the word on time
[1:36:47] everpresent
[1:36:48] water now look at this the prophet of
[1:36:51] God's talking he says you know what I
[1:36:53] come to tie up the Loose
[1:36:57] Ends the modern critic
[1:37:01] says he plagiarized Spurgeon he
[1:37:04] plagiarized this brother he plagiarized
[1:37:07] that brother well if they had tied the
[1:37:09] loose ends up nothing would have had to
[1:37:12] been done about
[1:37:13] it
[1:37:15] h come
[1:37:18] on he started tying the loose ends
[1:37:21] up and so as it is is he starts to move
[1:37:24] it now remember how our our brother
[1:37:26] Steven I I I really really enjoyed his
[1:37:29] service and um I'm going to I'm going to
[1:37:32] tell on somebody they'll probably be
[1:37:34] very mad at me for telling it but
[1:37:36] somebody in my family's phone identified
[1:37:39] them as a
[1:37:40] cactus and a picture of them as a cactus
[1:37:44] and um you know we just decided bro
[1:37:47] Steven was preaching to them even their
[1:37:49] phone confirmed it
[1:37:54] Cactus
[1:37:58] H but I realized as I sat here and
[1:38:00] listened to brother Steven preached the
[1:38:02] other day I was starting to show some
[1:38:05] attributes of a
[1:38:09] cactus very
[1:38:12] sticky not much bloom in my
[1:38:19] life
[1:38:20] [Music]
[1:38:22] amen amen amen
[1:38:27] amen why is it the point that he talked
[1:38:30] about a cactus in the sticker and the
[1:38:32] flower no it's the Holy Spirit allowing
[1:38:35] us to
[1:38:36] recognize that we're going there he
[1:38:40] showed us so that we could turn back
[1:38:42] from that and Pray For Rain spiritual
[1:38:46] rain in our lives we get dried up
[1:38:50] nobody's Mama's not going to tell you
[1:38:51] you know honey you you sure you're
[1:38:55] acting like this you don't know what
[1:38:56] you're talking about
[1:38:58] mom well you're nope don't even I'm done
[1:39:01] with this
[1:39:02] conversation but when the Holy Spirit
[1:39:04] comes down and says consider your way
[1:39:08] right we respond to it and God then
[1:39:12] opens the door to
[1:39:14] us okay I'm going to cut this off here
[1:39:17] but you
[1:39:20] know our brother Steven preached a about
[1:39:23] the desert did you guys enjoy his
[1:39:26] preaching I I I I've already hinted to
[1:39:28] him we'd like him to come back uh
[1:39:31] somewhere down the road maybe bring and
[1:39:34] see how was that brother Chris I don't
[1:39:37] know any other families in the church
[1:39:38] want to join the five
[1:39:40] Club anyway but you know I thought it
[1:39:44] was I thought it was very good but you
[1:39:47] see my brother and sister it all depends
[1:39:49] on where you're
[1:39:51] planted I want to ask you
[1:39:55] do you want to
[1:39:57] bloom every 10 12
[1:40:00] years or would you like to bloom every
[1:40:06] day being planted by the river of Living

[1:40:16] storm many of you won't remember but the
[1:40:19] time where the juwel stood right here in
[1:40:20] this pulpit and said I never pray for

[1:41:24] plants his promise in you and it becomes
[1:41:27] a living reality then something is
[1:41:30] different right you don't just go and
[1:41:32] say yes I believe it now that's all
[1:41:34] right the devil believes it like that
[1:41:36] but it's confirmed to you and the word

[1:41:45] to see what it
[1:41:46] is Lord plant me by the river of Living
