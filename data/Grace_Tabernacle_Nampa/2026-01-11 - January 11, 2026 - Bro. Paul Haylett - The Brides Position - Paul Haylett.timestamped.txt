[23:05] Number 106.
[23:23] Satan's [singing] like a roaring [music]
[23:26] l roaming to and fro
[23:32] seeking whom [singing and music] he may
[23:34] devour. The Bible tells me so.
[23:40] Many souls [music] have been [singing]
[23:43] his prey to fall in some weak hour.
[23:48] But [music] God has given us today his
[23:53] overcoming
[23:55] power.
[23:57] Greater is he [music] that is [singing]
[23:59] in me.
[24:01] Greater is he that is in [music] me.
[24:05] Greater is he [singing] that is in me
[24:09] than he that is in the world.
[24:14] On the [music and singing] day of
[24:16] Pentecost,
[24:18] a rushing mighty [singing] wind [music]
[24:22] blew into the upper room and baptized
[24:27] all of them
[24:30] with [music] a power greater [singing]
[24:33] than. any earthly foe.
[24:39] And I'm so [music] glad I got it, too.
[24:42] [singing] I'm going to let the whole
[24:45] world know.
[24:47] Greater is he that [music and singing]
[24:49] is in me.
[24:52] Greater is he that is in me.
[24:56] Greater [music] is he that is in me than
[25:00] he that is [music] in the world.
[25:04] Greater is he that [singing] is in me.
[25:09] Greater is he that is in me.
[25:11] [singing and music]
[25:13] Greater is he that is in me [singing]
[25:16] than he that is in the world.
[25:23] Amen.
[25:24] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[25:24] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[25:26] I'm going to sing number 824. He knows
[25:28] my name. I mean, I just wanted to read.
[25:32] We've kind of gone over this a couple
[25:34] times in the last [music] couple months,
[25:35] but
[25:38] just thinking of this. This song jumped
[25:41] out at me and I thought of this verse
[25:43] immediately, but Psalms [music] 139:17,
[25:46] you know, it says, "I have a maker. He
[25:48] formed my heart. Before even time began,
[25:50] my life [music] was in his hand." And
[25:52] goes on to say, "He knows my name. He
[25:53] knows every thought." If you read this
[25:56] Psalms 139, it talks about that. But
[25:58] then on 139:17 he says, "How precious
[26:00] also are thy thoughts unto me, oh God,
[26:03] how great is the sum [music] of them. If
[26:06] I should count them, they are more in
[26:07] number than the than the sand. When I
[26:10] wake, I am [music] still with thee."
[26:14] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. Hallelujah.
[26:18] I have a [singing and music]
[26:21] maker.
[26:25] [music] He [singing] formed my heart.
[26:32] And before even [singing and music] time
[26:36] began,
[26:38] my life was in his hand.
[26:44] [music]
[26:46] He [singing] knows
[26:48] my name.
[26:53] He [music] knows my every thought.
[26:57] [singing]
[27:00] He sees each [music]
[27:03] tear that falls
[27:06] and hears me when I call.
[27:13] I have a father.
[27:20] [music] He [singing] calls me his own
[27:28] and he'll never
[27:31] leave me.
[27:34] No [music] matter
[27:36] where I go,
[27:42] he knows [singing]
[27:44] my name.
[27:49] He knows my every thought.
[27:56] He knows each [music] tear [singing]
[27:59] that falls
[28:01] and hears me when I call.
[28:07] [music]
[28:10] I have the [singing] father.
[28:17] He [music] calls me his own
[28:23] and he'll never [singing] leave me
[28:27] [music]
[28:29] no matter [singing] where I go.
[28:36] He knows [singing] my name.
[28:43] &gt;&gt; [music]
[28:43] &gt;&gt; He knows [singing]
[28:45] my every thought.
[28:50] He [music] sees each tear that falls
[28:55] and hears me when I call.
[29:02] Amen. And then that second [music] verse
[29:05] just rang true with me where it when I
[29:07] wake, I'm still with you. says, "He'll
[29:09] never leave me no matter where I go."
[29:11] Amen. [music]
[29:12] Amen. Thank you, Lord Jesus. Amen. As we
[29:16] get ready to turn [music] the service
[29:18] over to our brother Paul, number 1071.
[29:21] Have your way.
[29:24] And ask you to stand again as we sing
[29:26] this.
[29:27] Man, I believe that's [music] our
[29:29] heart's desire this morning, Lord Jesus.
[29:30] Have your way in each life, each
[29:33] situation, whatever it would be. Lord
[29:35] God,

[29:59] Spirit,

[30:03] hearts and have your way.

[30:17] and as [music and singing]
[30:19] we pray,

[31:00] way.
[31:02] [music]

[31:12] as we pray.
[31:19] [music] Speak your word
[31:22] into our hearts and have your [singing]
[31:28] way.
[31:33] Speak your word
[31:36] into [singing] our [music] hearts and
[31:40] have your way.
[31:45] Speak your word
[31:49] into our hearts.
[31:54] You can't believe how this is right on
[31:56] time.
[32:00] Thank you, Lord. [music] Is it good to
[32:01] be in the house of God today? Amen. Just
[32:04] to greet each and every one of you this
[32:06] morning. [music] Amen. Maybe you could
[32:08] just take a moment and turn around,
[32:09] shake the hand of a brother or sister
[32:11] that's there by you. Say those beautiful
[32:14] words of God bless you. [music] Amen.
[32:17] Hallelujah.
[32:22] Hallelujah.
[32:30] Amen.
[32:33] So, just have a few announcements here
[32:35] that we'll make real quickly. Um,
[32:39] I need to move the youth group one
[32:42] Friday further down the calendar. So, it
[32:45] would be January the 23rd. And hopefully
[32:48] that's not a conflict
[32:51] uh for everyone. Uh but we did have a
[32:54] little conflict of schedule and it's
[32:56] also going to be hopefully sister Julia
[33:00] knows this but uh brother Sergey has
[33:03] volunteered their house for the youth
[33:06] meeting. So uh anyway so it'll be
[33:09] January 23rd 700 p.m. Brother Sergey
[33:12] sister Julia's house and this will be a
[33:15] surprise to my wife because this Friday
[33:18] will be unoccupied as far as that. So,
[33:22] we'll have Grace Kids this Friday at our
[33:25] house at 700 p.m. Uh, yes, you're
[33:28] invited, Sister Jerry. Amen. And, um,
[33:33] communion will be next Sunday, January
[33:36] the 18th at 5:00 p.m. here at the
[33:38] church. And I'd like to encourage each
[33:40] and everyone to come. Amen. It's always
[33:43] a special time, a beautiful time to um,
[33:47] just come in the presence of the Lord.
[33:50] Amen. Sister Sue, got you on my notes
[33:53] here, but you're here, so God bless you.
[33:56] And um so we certainly desire your
[34:00] prayers for our upcoming meetings. Uh
[34:03] we'll be in Chile and [snorts] Colombia
[34:05] and Ecuador and um sayingings how now
[34:09] the president of Colombia and the
[34:12] president of the United States are
[34:13] talking to each other. I think I feel a
[34:16] little more comfortable to go to
[34:18] Colombia [snorts] and um we just look
[34:20] forward to that. Those meetings um will
[34:24] be mostly focused towards young people
[34:27] and u uh we just desire for the Lord to
[34:31] lead us what to say. I'm not the only
[34:34] speaker. So I not only to be able to
[34:37] speak to the young people but desire to
[34:40] be in continuity with u others that are
[34:43] there speaking. So, um desire your
[34:46] prayers for that. And um
[34:51] the
[34:52] February the 4th, which is a Wednesday,
[34:55] February the 8th, which is a Sunday, our
[34:58] brother Adrien Stefen will be speaking
[35:01] here at the church. And uh so we look
[35:04] forward to uh him blessing you as we
[35:08] won't be here uh on that Wednesday the
[35:10] 4th and uh February Sunday the 8th. So,
[35:15] please be praying for them. They will be
[35:17] traveling back from a kind of a family
[35:19] reunion in uh Arizona and be traveling
[35:23] through. So, we just took advantage of
[35:25] that to ask them to speak. So, look
[35:28] forward to that. Amen. [snorts] It's
[35:31] good to be here this morning. I I
[35:34] believe Brother Cody, that must be your
[35:36] grandmother that's with you. Well, God
[35:38] bless you. And I would take that to be
[35:40] Lois's mother. [snorts] So, well,
[35:42] wonderful. I I might be prejudiced, but
[35:45] you have a wonderful family. And uh so
[35:48] God bless you today, I pray. Amen. Let's
[35:51] [snorts] turn in our Bibles. I want to
[35:53] speak to you today. Thank you,
[35:55] musicians, on the bride's position. And
[35:59] then you might say in parentheses uh in
[36:02] spiritual warfare. So the bride has a
[36:06] position that she's called to in this
[36:08] warfare. And you [snorts] know,
[36:10] sometimes we think of warfare in that
[36:12] sense as a very personal thing,
[36:14] spiritual warfare. But when we look at
[36:17] it in the context of what God has laid
[36:20] out in his word, we'd realize that when
[36:23] [snorts] it becomes so personal to us
[36:25] that we feel like we are slugging it
[36:27] out, we might possibly have taken the
[36:30] wrong position. Amen. So, we just want
[36:32] to look at that for a few minutes this
[36:34] morning. [snorts] And uh if you would
[36:36] turn in your Bibles to 1st Samuel 17:es
[36:41] 45-47.
[36:46] 1st Samuel 17 starting at the 45th
[36:49] verse.
[36:51] Then said David to the Philistine, "Thou
[36:54] comest to me with a sword, and with a
[36:57] spear, and with a shield, but I come to
[37:00] thee in the name of the Lord of Hosts,
[37:04] the God of the armies of Israel, whom
[37:07] thou hast defied.
[37:10] This day will the Lord deliver thee into
[37:12] my hand, and I will smite thee, and take
[37:15] thy head from thee, and I will give the
[37:18] carcasses of the host of the Philistines
[37:20] this day, and to the fowls of the air,
[37:23] and to the wild beasts of the earth, and
[37:26] all that all the earth may know that
[37:28] there is a God in Israel. And all this
[37:33] assembly shall know that the Lord saveth
[37:35] not with a sword and spear, for the
[37:37] battle is the Lord's, and he will give
[37:40] you into our hands. Heavenly Father, we
[37:44] ask for your blessings upon the word
[37:46] today. Bless each and everyone, I pray
[37:48] in your name. Amen. You may be seated,
[37:51] saints. Now, as we would look at this
[37:53] here in 1 Samuel, we want to not put
[37:56] this back in history. We don't want to
[37:58] put it as in days gone by, a different
[38:01] age. But [snorts] we want to just come
[38:03] and realize that in the day that we are
[38:05] living there is these spirits and we
[38:08] will just type them to the Philistines
[38:11] that it's there that they would
[38:12] approach. They approach with force. They
[38:14] approach believing that they have the
[38:16] upper hand and they want to challenge uh
[38:20] sons and daughters of God. And and it's
[38:22] not really you and I that he is
[38:24] challenging my brother. He's challenging
[38:26] God himself. And so it's there as we
[38:29] would look at this we would realize that
[38:32] in the battle when we come into a place
[38:34] that we feel like the battle has become
[38:36] so personal maybe we have a few
[38:39] shortcomings of our own that we feel
[38:41] like uh has uh maybe emboldened the
[38:44] enemy but we look at this and when we
[38:47] would stop and realize that that this is
[38:50] not something that you and I we can't go
[38:52] pick up a sword or a spear we can't pick
[38:55] up something to defend ourselves in a
[38:58] spiritual battle that way. But it's
[39:00] there that we'll come and we'll
[39:02] recognize that right here is a beautiful
[39:04] pattern or recipe, you might say, on how
[39:08] to deal with the enemy. We don't come
[39:10] talking of our own strength, of our own
[39:12] spirituality, but it's there that we
[39:15] come and take the position of what our
[39:17] God is going to do for us, has already
[39:20] promised to do for us. And this day, he
[39:24] says, the Lord will deliver thee into
[39:26] mine hand. and I will smite me. And it's
[39:29] not us, my brother and sister, but God
[39:31] has always used uh his people. He's
[39:34] always expressed himself through his
[39:36] people of what he is going to do, what
[39:39] he has done. And it's there that it's we
[39:42] would look at this and he's talking
[39:44] about taking thine head from thee. And I
[39:47] I want to type this for just a moment if
[39:49] it's okay uh to to step over into
[39:52] another deal. My brother and sister, we
[39:54] in the world we live in as humans, we we
[39:58] would look and all around us, we'll see
[40:00] that headship is around us. Now, in the
[40:02] natural, we as citizens would be here
[40:05] and there's mayors of our cities.
[40:07] There's a sheriff over the sheriff uh
[40:10] you know, deputies and and there's a
[40:11] mayor over the city. We have been as
[40:14] humanity always under some form of a
[40:17] headship. There is a a place a time and
[40:20] and we come even whether you agree or
[40:22] not but we have a president of our
[40:25] country and and we're under that
[40:27] headship and whether we totally agree or
[40:30] not you go around the world and they'll
[40:32] identify you by the headship that's over
[40:34] you. So you go and and as we have many
[40:37] times went to South America, we've been
[40:39] to Africa, Europe by God's grace. And
[40:42] you go there and almost everywhere you
[40:44] go, somebody asks you a question about
[40:46] the politics of the president. And you
[40:49] know, if you agree, that makes it real
[40:51] simple. If you have a slightly different
[40:53] point of view, uh maybe you will explain
[40:56] yourself, maybe you won't. But you see,
[40:58] the headship is always what identifies
[41:02] us. And here is David dealing with these
[41:06] Philistines and he's telling them he's
[41:08] going to take their headship from them.
[41:10] In other words, he's saying that we have
[41:12] revoked your headship over our lives.
[41:16] You're not going to put your headship
[41:17] over Israel. And I say today that we as
[41:20] sons and daughters of God are here today
[41:23] to clearly let the devil know we have
[41:26] revoked his headship over our lives.
[41:29] Amen. He's no longer going to influence
[41:31] or control us. We are stepping out under
[41:34] the word of God, a promise of God. Not
[41:37] our own thoughts, not what we think we
[41:39] can do, but what God said, "I will do
[41:42] through you." Amen. Aren't you glad that
[41:44] God deals with you personally? [snorts]
[41:46] Amen. So, it's there that there is a
[41:49] God. Amen. He's not only in Israel. He
[41:52] promised to be Israel a chosen people,
[41:54] but he also said, "I have a people that
[41:57] were not a people, but now are my
[41:59] people." And there we stand on the word
[42:02] of God today. And I say emphatically,
[42:04] whether you have a little struggle, you
[42:06] have trials in your life, we are cutting
[42:09] off Satan's headship over our lives.
[42:13] Amen. And so we'll look at this. You
[42:15] know, some of the greatest struggles
[42:17] that we have is that Satan has convinced
[42:20] us or is convincing us that this is our
[42:23] battle. That we're the one that's in the
[42:25] midst of this fight. And we might even
[42:28] at times say, "I I wish there was
[42:30] someone cared. I wish someone would help
[42:32] me." But you see, if we'll turn it over
[42:34] to the Lord, Amen. [snorts] we can be
[42:37] convinced that it's not our battle any
[42:39] longer. That we can look at this and
[42:42] say, "You know what? uh what what I'm
[42:44] facing today uh comes down and I'll just
[42:47] tie this back here a few Wednesdays ago
[42:50] where brother David was preaching on
[42:52] submission and and it comes down that we
[42:55] must come to a place that even our
[42:57] trials and struggle of the day we're
[43:00] willing to just hand that to the Lord.
[43:02] That's not a copout my brother and
[43:03] sister. That's not that's not just
[43:05] ignoring what it is but it's coming to
[43:07] the position that God said I want you as
[43:10] your husband as the bridegroom. Amen.
[43:12] and our Lord and Savior. Amen. I want
[43:14] you to just take your troubles and I
[43:16] want you to bring them to me and lay
[43:18] them down and let me take care of him.
[43:20] And I believe that we could testify
[43:22] today that many times when we come and
[43:25] have almost impossible situations and we
[43:28] finally get past oursel. Yes, I'm I mean
[43:31] it that way. We get past ourself and
[43:34] finally give it to the Lord and he comes
[43:36] on the scene and takes care of it. Amen.
[43:39] That's what he promised to do for us.
[43:41] But as long as we hold on to it, I guess
[43:44] the old analogy is is we say, "Well, I
[43:46] took it to the altar." But you see, when
[43:48] we got up from the altar, we picked it
[43:50] up again and took it home with us. I
[43:53] don't care what your situation is. Put
[43:55] it on the altar, walk away, and say,
[43:57] "Lord, I'm trusting you with this
[43:59] situation in my life." Amen. And it's
[44:03] there that God then realizes that we um
[44:07] we trust him. We truly trust him. I
[44:09] loved how that come out in in those uh
[44:12] words there. Uh brother David spoke it.
[44:15] Uh brother Isaac spoke it [snorts] uh
[44:17] there that it really comes down to a
[44:19] situation of trust. And so when Satan is
[44:23] no longer
[44:25] able to convince us that this is our
[44:27] battle, all the ups and downs of life,
[44:29] strife and struggle. I know none of you
[44:31] ever have any of that. Right. You don't
[44:33] have ups and downs. You don't have
[44:34] struggles. Hey, that's somebody else.
[44:37] Yeah. All right. Right.
[44:39] &gt;&gt; Amen. But see, when we as believers try
[44:43] to fight the good fight on our own,
[44:45] &gt;&gt; that's it.
[44:46] &gt;&gt; Imagine you go out tomorrow and you
[44:49] would encounter not a Goliath, but just
[44:52] say a soldier of our day, a man who's
[44:54] trained day in and day out on the art of
[44:57] warfare. Would we have a chance against
[45:00] that man? I I would say no. Amen.
[45:03] Because that's what he's trained to do.
[45:05] And Satan's had all these thousands of
[45:08] years just his practice on humanity in
[45:11] his battle against the believer against
[45:14] the word of God. And we would go out on
[45:16] our own to fight against a trained
[45:19] warrior, it's not going to work. But
[45:22] when we would go out there as David went
[45:24] out that day, such a beautiful example,
[45:27] and said, "This is not about me. It's
[45:29] not what I can do." Amen. Even the rock
[45:32] that David rocks that David picked up
[45:34] out of the brook, my brother and sister,
[45:36] were ordained of God to be the right
[45:39] ones. He didn't just go scoop some
[45:41] random handful, but God led him which
[45:44] stone to pick. Amen. And he knew which
[45:47] stone would be the end of Goliath. Amen.
[45:50] And he knows today what word in your
[45:53] heart will be the end of Satan's
[45:55] headship over your life. Amen. And when
[45:58] we'll hold to that and believe it. Amen.
[46:00] But as long as we're trying to fight
[46:02] this good fight on our own, we're going
[46:04] to leave ourselves open to the ws of the
[46:07] devil. Amen. Sometimes you hear people
[46:10] say, "Well, I I I'm concerned. I'm
[46:12] afraid of being deceived." My brother
[46:14] and sister, the word of God says that it
[46:17] not possible. That's right.
[46:19] &gt;&gt; Amen. We should have that kind of
[46:20] confidence in what the word says to us
[46:23] that it's not possible. Amen. To be
[46:25] deceived. Now, there will be those where
[46:28] we can't we can't decide who is and who
[46:31] isn't. But for a real believer that was
[46:33] chose of almighty God, amen, has a
[46:36] desire in their heart, the word is very
[46:38] clear that Satan will not deceive you.
[46:41] So, quit being afraid of him.
[46:43] &gt;&gt; Amen. Come boldly to the throne of God
[46:46] and quit being afraid of what Satan
[46:48] might do to you or your family. Uh it
[46:51] would be there, my brother and sister.
[46:52] people. I I was just talking to an
[46:54] individual recently and they're afraid
[46:56] of cancer. And I don't blame them.
[46:58] Cancer is a horrible thing. But I tell
[47:01] you, my brother and sister, there's not
[47:03] one thing can happen to your life, but
[47:05] what God allows it. Amen. He didn't call
[47:08] you to be afraid of what this world was.
[47:11] He called us in the scripture to be
[47:13] conquerors in this world. Amen. I don't
[47:16] care whether you have a sickness or
[47:18] whether you're perfectly healthy, you're
[47:20] still a conqueror. Amen. Because that's
[47:23] what the word of God said you would be.
[47:26] Amen. Now in 2 Corinthians
[47:29] the 10th chapter verses 3-5.
[47:32] For though we walk in the flesh, we do
[47:35] not war after the flesh.
[47:38] &gt;&gt; For the weapons of our warfare are not
[47:40] carnal.
[47:41] &gt;&gt; Amen. So there's not one thing we could
[47:43] pick up today to defend ourselves in a
[47:46] spiritual warfare.
[47:48] Amen.
[47:50] &gt;&gt; But mighty through God to the pulling
[47:52] down of strongholds,
[47:54] casting down imaginations and every high
[47:57] thing that exaltth itself against the
[48:00] knowledge of God, bringing into
[48:02] captivity every thought to the obedience
[48:05] of Christ. Now I tell you my brother and
[48:08] sister, I just may be a little direct
[48:10] here this morning, but one of the
[48:12] greatest battles that's being fought
[48:14] today in the world we live in is the
[48:17] battle of imagination. Amen. See, it's
[48:20] an unwinable battle. Actually, we'll sit
[48:22] here today and you would say, you know
[48:24] what? I I'm just not even going to have
[48:26] those thoughts. I'm not going to allow
[48:28] myself to go off into kind of a fairy
[48:31] tale type world of if this happened,
[48:33] this would happen. I would do this and I
[48:35] might that. You know, it's like one man
[48:38] said. He said, you know, you uh imagine
[48:40] yourself.
[48:42] &gt;&gt; Going to work. Get up. Make it real.
[48:46] &gt;&gt; Amen. And we can imagine a lot of
[48:48] things. People I read a little deal the
[48:50] other day. Caught my eye that people
[48:53] admit or or will acknowledge that they
[48:56] waste many hours imagining what life
[48:59] would be if they won the lottery.
[49:02] Imagine
[49:04] that.
[49:05] &gt;&gt; I'm going to just sit here in a chair
[49:06] and do nothing. I don't even have a
[49:08] lottery ticket. And I'm not advocating
[49:09] you get one.
[49:11] &gt;&gt; Amen. We're not gamblers. But it's
[49:13] there. They sit there and they waste
[49:15] hours imagining if I had a $100 million
[49:18] I would this and I would that. But you
[49:21] see that won't change their life. Amen.
[49:24] So it's there that that is a battle that
[49:27] is unwininnable unless that is that
[49:29] spirit is broke. So it's there. Amen.
[49:33] That battle of imagination is unwinable
[49:36] until it is cast down. This is what the
[49:38] scripture says. Cast down and brought
[49:40] into captivity and full obedience to the
[49:44] word of God.
[49:45] &gt;&gt; Amen. So we have to even surrender our
[49:48] own thoughts day by day back to God
[49:52] because my brother and sister otherwise
[49:54] Satan wiggles his way in. It might start
[49:56] with an imagination that's very simple,
[49:59] almost clean. you might say. And if that
[50:01] is not contained, it will become an
[50:04] imagination that controls their life and
[50:06] causes them to be outside of the grace
[50:08] or the will of God. Amen. So, it's there
[50:11] because I'm telling you, there is an
[50:13] endless supply of topics
[50:16] &gt;&gt; to imagine.
[50:18] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[50:20] &gt;&gt; And very few of them are profitable.
[50:23] &gt;&gt; Because the word doesn't tell us to take
[50:25] the word and imagine what it's going to
[50:28] do for us. The word tells us to take the
[50:31] word and put it into action. And when it
[50:34] is in action, God will fulfill it in our
[50:37] life. Amen. As the word says, whatever
[50:40] you confess, your body will obey your
[50:44] confession. It's not for us to look to
[50:47] the pastor, the preacher, prophet, and
[50:49] say, "Now, if he says it, it'll be
[50:51] good." It's what you profess is what
[50:54] your body will obey. And when we come to
[50:58] the place that we're not just imagining
[50:59] we're a bride going to take a rapture,
[51:01] but we believe it with all of our heart
[51:03] because the word says so. The word said
[51:06] it's going to come to pass. I believe
[51:08] it's going to come to pass. I don't know
[51:10] exactly how it will take place. I don't
[51:13] need to know how it will take place. I
[51:15] need to be ready for it to take place.
[51:18] Amen. And when we are ready for it to
[51:20] take place, you will get to see the
[51:22] revelation of Christ in you unfolding.
[51:26] Amen. And it won't be imagination.
[51:29] &gt;&gt; It will be the reality of all realities.
[51:32] That will be what really really shows
[51:34] you who you really are. Amen. So all of
[51:39] these topics that can be imagined over,
[51:42] there's only a few that would be even,
[51:44] you might say, profitable to a
[51:45] Christian. [snorts] Mostly this realm of
[51:48] imagination is a realm that Satan dwells
[51:51] in. Amen. People have that. Now, I'm
[51:54] going to just say something just real
[51:56] blunt. I hope you don't mind, but I I
[51:58] had a a I I guess you could say a
[52:01] friend, fellow minister years ago, and
[52:04] and he was helping an individual, a
[52:07] woman, [snorts] and uh anyway, after a
[52:11] period of time, this thing gets all out
[52:13] of out of bounds. He comes, tells his
[52:16] wife,
[52:17] uh I'm in love with her.
[52:20] He divorces his wife. In less than one
[52:24] year,
[52:25] &gt;&gt; him and that other lady couldn't stand
[52:27] the sight of each other. And it come out
[52:30] that he shared with a closer friend than
[52:32] I would have been considered that he
[52:34] realized he only imagined that he was in
[52:37] love.
[52:39] He was seduced by a spirit.
[52:42] &gt;&gt; He dwelt on that. And the more you think
[52:45] about it, come on, imagine with me,
[52:50] [snorts]
[52:52] &gt;&gt; sisters, you might not relate to this,
[52:54] but you know,
[52:56] if that nice pickup is sitting on the
[52:59] corner that you drive by every single
[53:02] day, the more you dwell on that pickup,
[53:06] you'll go from, "That's a nice looking
[53:07] pickup." Pickups are safe topic. Amen.
[53:10] And uh I I like that pickup. That's a
[53:13] nice Oh, it's even the color I like. I
[53:15] like everything about that. You keep
[53:18] doing that. Pretty soon, you find
[53:20] yourself in another little world about
[53:23] that. And you stop and you look at it
[53:25] and you think, "Well, I I'm just going
[53:26] to look. I I wouldn't I wouldn't buy or
[53:30] whatever." But the salesman, he's pretty
[53:32] good. He says, "Hey, I know you said
[53:34] you're not buying it, but just take it
[53:36] for a drive." Amen. So, you take it for
[53:39] a drive. You go home and your
[53:41] imagination takes you further. Next
[53:43] thing you know, you see yourself with
[53:45] your fishing pole in the back driving
[53:48] out to the lake. Amen. And you see all
[53:50] of your friends saying, "Wow, nice
[53:53] truck, man." And all of this is
[53:55] imaginary.
[53:58] &gt;&gt; But if you don't bring that under
[53:59] control, you'll find yourself with a $8
[54:01] or $900 a month payment on a pickup that
[54:05] you cannot like or even enjoy because
[54:08] you can't afford it. That's right.
[54:10] &gt;&gt; Amen. And that's how the devil works.
[54:12] Amen. I'm not calling car salesmans
[54:14] devils, but they're close.
[54:16] &gt;&gt; Amen. There's got to be a few real
[54:17] Christians out there, but boy, I'll tell
[54:19] you what, they are slick.
[54:22] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[54:22] &gt;&gt; Preachers.
[54:24] &gt;&gt; Yeah. Just like preachers. [laughter]
[54:27] Oh, that wasn't pointed at me. So,
[54:29] praise God. But look at this. See these
[54:33] things like this, just how how simple
[54:35] these things can be. And we'll look at
[54:38] this. As I said, this quotation, got
[54:40] ahead of myself. There was a man that
[54:42] once made the statement. He said, um,
[54:45] "Imagine yourself at work.
[54:48] Get up and make it real." Amen. There it
[54:52] is. Sometimes we just need to get up and
[54:55] make it real, not sit and argue. I like
[54:59] how Brother Brown put that. He says,
[55:01] "Some would say he's coming on a white
[55:03] horse and some would say he's coming on
[55:05] a cloud, but as long as you believe that
[55:08] the Lord Jesus is coming, you can leave
[55:11] the rest of that to be decided at the
[55:14] moment it takes place. You don't have to
[55:16] argue or imagine what it might be. If
[55:19] we're ready for a rapture, we'll be in a
[55:21] rapture."
[55:22] &gt;&gt; Amen. And that's not imagination either.
[55:25] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. And now in Philippians the 2
[55:27] chapter. Quite lengthy reading here.
[55:30] Amen.
[55:37] Pardon me. I've been a little dehydrated
[55:39] lately.
[55:45] If there be therefore any consolation in
[55:49] Christ,
[55:51] if any comfort of love, if any
[55:53] fellowship of the spirit, any bowels and
[55:57] mercies, fulfill ye my joy, that ye be
[56:01] likeminded, having the same love, being
[56:04] of one accord, of one mind. Let nothing
[56:07] be done through strife or vain glory.
[56:11] Now vain glory my brother and sister
[56:13] when you look through that and stretch
[56:15] that out would be you imagining being
[56:19] exalted
[56:20] for what you have done.
[56:23] The element of imagination has now come
[56:26] in believing that if I do this I will
[56:29] receive the praise of the people.
[56:32] &gt;&gt; When we come to that kind of thinking we
[56:35] should know that we're on the wrong
[56:36] track. Amen. I don't care what office we
[56:39] have or what place in the economy of
[56:41] God. We're doing it to give praise and
[56:44] glory and honor to the Lord, not to
[56:46] receive praise, glory, and honor to
[56:48] ourselves. So, anytime that we can
[56:50] imagine oursel being exalted over
[56:53] something, if I do this, and you know, I
[56:56] I just we'll pick on preachers. Brother
[56:58] David just set the tone right there.
[56:59] We'll pick on the preachers. Anyway, my
[57:02] brother and sister, you know, if we ever
[57:04] come to the place that we as preachers
[57:06] are trying to preach what we might call
[57:08] the home run, something that all the
[57:11] people are like, "That was so
[57:13] magnificent."
[57:15] &gt;&gt; Everybody, you got to go listen to this
[57:18] little portion. It was so incredible. My
[57:21] brother and sister, that's nothing but
[57:23] trouble for the preacher. [snorts] If
[57:25] he's preaching for the glory of God and
[57:27] it speaks to your heart, that's one
[57:29] thing. But if the preacher has massaged
[57:32] and studied and moved the words around
[57:34] just so they have a flow and a rhythm
[57:37] and a rhyme and they're catchy and he
[57:39] does that because he wants it to have
[57:41] some impact that he's actually putting
[57:43] into it.
[57:45] &gt;&gt; That might get people excited, but that
[57:47] doesn't have any eternal glory in it.
[57:49] Amen. That's a man receiving his
[57:51] exaltation here when he should be just
[57:54] lifting up and and uh we'll we'll touch
[57:57] on that here in a minute in the
[57:58] scripture. Amen. Let nothing be done
[58:01] through strife or vain glory, but in
[58:03] loneliness of mind, let each esteem
[58:06] other better than himself. Boy, I tell
[58:10] you what is such a plague in the world
[58:11] we have today. The world talks about
[58:14] influencers. Well, my brother and
[58:16] sister, let me tell you, those people
[58:17] who are influencers usually have a very
[58:20] arrogant or superior air about them
[58:23] because they now have thousand, 10,000,
[58:26] 100,000 uh people looking to them for uh
[58:30] what should I fix for supper? Let's see
[58:32] what they say.
[58:33] &gt;&gt; Oh, what how should I decorate my house?
[58:35] Let's see what they say. My brother and
[58:38] sister, that's a kind of a headship. You
[58:40] you might disagree with me and that's
[58:42] good, but that's a kind of a headship
[58:44] because people are not living their
[58:45] life. They're living another person's
[58:49] life out through themsel trying to
[58:52] receive what that person had. Amen. Now,
[58:55] if you already have the idea uh uh you
[58:58] know to to do something in your house,
[59:01] sisters, you like to decorate. Maybe you
[59:04] say, I you know, I'm thinking about
[59:05] doing something like this. I wonder if
[59:07] anybody does that. and you see have
[59:09] somebody else has done that. That's one
[59:11] thing. But I'm talking about when people
[59:13] find themselves being nothing more than
[59:16] copycats of someone else. Now imagine
[59:19] when that spirit comes in the church.
[59:22] &gt;&gt; Oh, my brother and sister, the prophet
[59:24] of God said that, you know, you would
[59:26] find it that if they wear a hat a
[59:28] certain way, they wear a certain deal,
[59:30] they paint their front door a certain
[59:31] color, they buy a certain car. My
[59:34] brother and sister, that's just not what
[59:35] this is about. The only influence we
[59:38] should be exerting on each other is
[59:40] let's get closer to Christ. Let's look
[59:42] more like Christ every day. Will you
[59:44] come with me so we can come together and
[59:47] look like Christ?
[59:49] &gt;&gt; There we can come and be. But we still
[59:52] don't want to be the copycat. We want
[59:54] that word, Amen, to speak to our heart.
[59:57] We don't want to say amen because they
[59:59] said amen. We don't want to do something
[1:00:02] because they did it. We want to do it
[1:00:04] because the Holy Ghost moving in your
[1:00:06] life is moving you into the word,
[1:00:09] changing our lives, drawing us closer.
[1:00:13] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:00:18] &gt;&gt; And don't say it because somebody else
[1:00:20] said it.
[1:00:20] &gt;&gt; That's actually a parrot.
[1:00:22] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:00:23] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:00:24] &gt;&gt; Right.
[1:00:24] &gt;&gt; I used to have pretty good imitation of
[1:00:26] parrot when I was a kid.
[1:00:29] We had a neighbor,
[1:00:32] young lady. She'd always like, "Polly,
[1:00:36] oh Paulie,
[1:00:42] I still am traumatized."
[1:00:48] And because of that, just that voice,
[1:00:52] this sounds a little rude, forgive me,
[1:00:54] but I got to where my only defense was
[1:00:56] to walk around Polly,
[1:00:59] Polly, Polly wants a cracker.
[1:01:04] You talk about something that must have
[1:01:06] went deeper than I thought.
[1:01:09] But look at this, my brother and sister.
[1:01:10] We're not called to be parrots.
[1:01:12] &gt;&gt; No, sir.
[1:01:13] &gt;&gt; Amen. This word might come out. We might
[1:01:15] be saying the exact same words, but it
[1:01:17] needs to come from the very depths of
[1:01:19] our heart. It needs to be so real to us
[1:01:22] that if no one ever said it, we would be
[1:01:25] saying it. Amen. When no one ever wanted
[1:01:28] to live it, we would want to live it.
[1:01:31] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:01:31] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:01:32] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:01:33] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:01:38] &gt;&gt; Let nothing be done through strive for
[1:01:40] vain glory, but in loneliness of mind,
[1:01:42] let each esteem
[1:01:44] other better than themselves. Imagine
[1:01:47] what kind of families in church we will
[1:01:49] have
[1:01:50] &gt;&gt; if we look out and we esteem everyone in
[1:01:54] our presence
[1:01:56] better, higher.
[1:01:57] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:01:58] &gt;&gt; More important
[1:01:59] &gt;&gt; than oursel.
[1:02:00] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:02:01] &gt;&gt; Oh, I'm not talking about us putting
[1:02:03] oursel down, but just looking and making
[1:02:06] a conscious decision.
[1:02:08] &gt;&gt; I'll lift them up. You want to know one
[1:02:10] of the simplest ways to show that you
[1:02:14] esteem someone better than yourself?
[1:02:19] is when you will spend your time
[1:02:22] praying for them.
[1:02:23] &gt;&gt; That's exactly right.
[1:02:25] &gt;&gt; When you're willing to spend this
[1:02:26] limited amount of time that we have
[1:02:29] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:02:30] &gt;&gt; in this life. And trust me, to those
[1:02:33] that are young, you might not recognize
[1:02:35] it. You get a little older. Time is
[1:02:36] fleeting.
[1:02:37] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:02:38] &gt;&gt; I mean, you have a birthday and it seems
[1:02:39] like it was yesterday and they're
[1:02:40] telling you happy birthday again.
[1:02:42] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:02:43] &gt;&gt; That's how valuable your time is. But
[1:02:46] when you esteem someone higher than
[1:02:49] yourself, you will take your time
[1:02:52] &gt;&gt; and you will go before the throne of God
[1:02:55] &gt;&gt; and you will spend that time as though
[1:02:57] it was currency,
[1:02:59] &gt;&gt; lifting them up in prayer. That's when
[1:03:01] you know you're actually esteeming
[1:03:03] someone higher than yourself.
[1:03:06] &gt;&gt; The Lord shows us not to spend our time
[1:03:08] praying for me. Lord, help me. Help me.
[1:03:11] Help me. Now, that's not entirely wrong.
[1:03:14] There's times that you need to cry out
[1:03:16] to the Lord and ask him to help you.
[1:03:18] Amen. Look not every man on his own
[1:03:21] things, but every man also on the things
[1:03:23] of others. Let this mind be in you which
[1:03:26] is also in Christ Jesus, who being in
[1:03:29] the form of God, thought it not robbery
[1:03:31] to be equal with God, but made himself
[1:03:34] of no reputation to took upon him the
[1:03:37] form of a servant, and was made into the
[1:03:39] likeness of men. and being found in the
[1:03:42] fashion as a man, he humbled himself and
[1:03:45] became obedient unto death, even the
[1:03:48] death of the cross. Wherefore God also
[1:03:51] hath highly exalted him, and given him a
[1:03:55] name which is above every name, that at
[1:03:58] the name of Jesus, every knee should bow
[1:04:01] of things in heaven and things in earth
[1:04:03] and things under the earth, and that
[1:04:05] every tongue should confess that Jesus
[1:04:08] Christ is Lord to the glory of God the
[1:04:11] Father.
[1:04:12] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:04:13] &gt;&gt; Wherefore, my beloved, really want to
[1:04:14] focus on this verse 12. Wherefore, my
[1:04:17] beloved, as you have always obeyed, not
[1:04:20] as in my presence only, but now much
[1:04:23] more in my absence, work out your own
[1:04:27] salvation with fear and trembling.
[1:04:31] &gt;&gt; For it is God which workketh in you both
[1:04:33] to will and to do of his good pleasure.
[1:04:36] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:04:37] &gt;&gt; Amen. My brothers and sisters, let's
[1:04:39] look at this for a moment. It is not us
[1:04:41] doing this work, but it's God working in
[1:04:44] you. Amen. to do of his will and his
[1:04:48] good pleasure. See, the surrendered life
[1:04:52] leaves oursel open as it would be to be
[1:04:55] controlled. People would say, "Well,
[1:04:57] Christians, I've been told this before.
[1:04:58] Christians are just puppets." Well,
[1:05:00] praise God. As long as it's Jesus Christ
[1:05:02] pulling the string, I'll be a puppet.
[1:05:05] Amen. Hallelujah. I don't want to have
[1:05:07] some man pulling my string, but as long
[1:05:09] as the Holy Ghost is pulling the
[1:05:11] strings, I'll be a puppet any day of the
[1:05:13] week. Now look at what God is doing
[1:05:15] here. He is showing us how that we
[1:05:19] coming to a place that we have to work
[1:05:21] out our salvation with fear and
[1:05:23] trembling. Can I throw a little
[1:05:25] curveball at you this morning just to
[1:05:27] stimulate your thoughts? Amen. Let's not
[1:05:30] put it as the emphasis being on whether
[1:05:32] the gospel is true or not.
[1:05:34] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:05:35] &gt;&gt; Amen. So many people that are in
[1:05:37] positions, they'll say, "Well, I I don't
[1:05:39] know if the Bible is true or not." My
[1:05:42] brother and sister, a person till he
[1:05:44] gets beyond that doesn't have anything
[1:05:46] at all. You've got to come to a place
[1:05:49] that you know it's true. But the real
[1:05:51] issue that really comes and effects
[1:05:53] lives in a way that we don't normally
[1:05:54] recognize is the [snorts] fact is
[1:05:57] whether we're going to trust God or not.
[1:05:59] If you don't trust God, you are not
[1:06:01] going to trust his word. Amen. But if
[1:06:04] you trust God, you will read his word
[1:06:07] and believe and act on every word of it
[1:06:10] because you trust what he said.
[1:06:12] &gt;&gt; Amen. Look at Israel coming through the
[1:06:15] wilderness, my brother and sister. Every
[1:06:17] battle, every situation they had was
[1:06:20] ultimately not whether God was real or
[1:06:23] not. They would have told you God was
[1:06:24] real, but they were there and they
[1:06:27] didn't trust what God said. Now, you can
[1:06:30] take it even from a historical point of
[1:06:32] view. Many people have analyzed this. If
[1:06:35] Israel had completely trusted God, their
[1:06:38] journey from Egypt into the promised
[1:06:42] land would have been a very, very short,
[1:06:45] quick journey.
[1:06:48] &gt;&gt; But because they did not trust God, they
[1:06:51] repeated what he said he would do. He's
[1:06:54] taking us to a promised land. But how
[1:06:56] can that land be better? I mean, I must
[1:06:58] admit, I was a foreman on the
[1:07:00] brickmaking crew in Egypt, and I had a
[1:07:02] pretty good job. And how can the
[1:07:04] promised land be better than I had? I
[1:07:06] had all kinds of benefits. I had paid
[1:07:08] vacation. I had this and that. Had a
[1:07:10] little authority. You know, I don't know
[1:07:12] what the promised land will be. I never
[1:07:14] heard my parents or my
[1:07:15] great-grandparents or the stories of
[1:07:17] those in days gone by saying that Israel
[1:07:20] was all that great. There was always an
[1:07:22] enemy somewhere that was right there in
[1:07:24] the borderland to attack us. And nobody
[1:07:26] attacked us in Egypt except for
[1:07:28] Egyptians.
[1:07:30] &gt;&gt; And we learned how to deal with
[1:07:33] Egyptians.
[1:07:35] We're not here to have a truce with the
[1:07:38] devil.
[1:07:40] &gt;&gt; And just learn how to get along with the
[1:07:42] devil.
[1:07:43] &gt;&gt; My brother and sister, we're called by
[1:07:44] the word of God to overcome the devil.
[1:07:47] And about the time you start, as the
[1:07:49] scripture says, putting your foot on his
[1:07:51] neck, he is not going to lay there
[1:07:54] pacified.
[1:07:56] He's going to fight you. He's going to
[1:07:58] push back. He's going to bring it to
[1:08:00] where you're called a radical. He's
[1:08:02] going to bring it to where you're
[1:08:03] called, you know, a cult or or some
[1:08:06] other thing because you just don't fit
[1:08:08] our box.
[1:08:10] &gt;&gt; But as long as you just make friends
[1:08:12] with the neighbor,
[1:08:19] everything will be fine.
[1:08:25] Sometimes we can take it down a little
[1:08:26] too personal, but I'll just tell you
[1:08:29] time in my life that when people would
[1:08:31] tell jokes that were not right,
[1:08:34] even though I could care less about
[1:08:36] their joke, in fact, many of them were
[1:08:38] offensive, I would just kind of go
[1:08:43] cuz I just didn't want to deal with it.
[1:08:45] But I tell you what, God one day come
[1:08:47] along in my life
[1:08:50] and I'm sure many of you
[1:08:52] And he said, "No longer.
[1:08:55] &gt;&gt; No longer.
[1:08:56] &gt;&gt; No longer." They tell their joke. I'm
[1:08:59] sorry to put it this way, their smutty
[1:09:01] joke.
[1:09:02] &gt;&gt; And you look them in the face, not
[1:09:04] because you're so spiritual, but
[1:09:06] something inside of you. You look them
[1:09:07] in the face and you say, "You know what?
[1:09:09] Would you tell that in front of your
[1:09:10] wife or daughter?"
[1:09:15] &gt;&gt; No, I wouldn't. Well, then why would you
[1:09:17] tell us?
[1:09:18] &gt;&gt; Yeah, that's right.
[1:09:20] You got to make a stand somewhere,
[1:09:22] saints.
[1:09:22] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:09:24] &gt;&gt; We'll either stand for the Lord or we'll
[1:09:26] fall for whatever else comes along.
[1:09:28] &gt;&gt; God help us.
[1:09:31] &gt;&gt; Amen. So, it's not whether it's true or
[1:09:34] not. The devil believes the Bible.
[1:09:36] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:09:38] &gt;&gt; And you talk about being in a tough
[1:09:40] position. The devil, while he's here
[1:09:43] trying to get everybody to walk away and
[1:09:44] trample on the Bible, knows that the
[1:09:46] Bible's true. and he reads the Bible and
[1:09:49] he sees what his end is in the Bible.
[1:09:52] And it's not that he somehow can
[1:09:54] circumvent his end. He just wants
[1:09:56] company when he gets there.
[1:09:59] &gt;&gt; And the more company he gets, the better
[1:10:00] he feels.
[1:10:06] But whether we'll trust or not, let's
[1:10:08] take a moment,
[1:10:09] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:10:10] &gt;&gt; today and just ponder in your own
[1:10:11] thoughts.
[1:10:13] How much do I trust the Lord?
[1:10:15] &gt;&gt; That's it.
[1:10:23] There's so many levels of trust.
[1:10:25] &gt;&gt; We see them all through the scripture.
[1:10:26] If you read the scripture in that
[1:10:28] fashion, you'll see levels of trust
[1:10:30] through the Bible that range from just a
[1:10:33] simple take a next step to a fiery
[1:10:36] furnace or a lion's den.
[1:10:47] You see, a man or a woman can have all
[1:10:50] of the word of God,
[1:10:53] but if you can't trust it, you have
[1:10:54] nothing.
[1:10:55] &gt;&gt; That's it. That's exactly right.
[1:10:58] &gt;&gt; And this will be a little harsh, and I'm
[1:11:00] sorry our visitors are hopefully not
[1:11:01] offensive, but my brother and sister,
[1:11:04] more and more churches are talking about
[1:11:06] Yes. talking about Christ, talking about
[1:11:09] savior, talking about all of this, but
[1:11:12] we don't believe in this portion. We
[1:11:14] don't believe this portion is important.
[1:11:16] We overlook this because our church
[1:11:18] doesn't believe in that. This part right
[1:11:20] here is good, but this part dangerous.
[1:11:23] My brother and sister, when you start to
[1:11:25] part and parcel the word of God, it's
[1:11:27] because you don't trust God. Amen.
[1:11:32] &gt;&gt; Cuz there's nothing in this Bible that a
[1:11:34] real Christian can't say amen to.
[1:11:38] &gt;&gt; God's word is not to be part and
[1:11:40] parcelled of what part makes us feel
[1:11:42] good and what part feels too judgmental.
[1:11:44] God wants you to make the rapture your
[1:11:47] own self. He wants you to be in glory
[1:11:49] with him. Amen. He's not here playing
[1:11:52] games as it would be a puppet show. But
[1:11:54] what happens is if we don't trust it, we
[1:11:56] find a way around it.
[1:11:59] &gt;&gt; Right.
[1:12:00] Reminds me
[1:12:03] years ago I had a friend quite
[1:12:05] successful in business and there was
[1:12:08] another man kind of courting him to
[1:12:09] maybe merge their businesses together
[1:12:13] and the man come to the man that I knew
[1:12:17] and says my lawyer has has drafted a
[1:12:20] contract and um if you want to do this
[1:12:25] just sign it. and he says, "You know
[1:12:27] what? I have a lawyer of my own, an
[1:12:31] advocate of my own."
[1:12:34] And he said, "I'll take it and let him
[1:12:35] read it." And the guy go, "Oh, you don't
[1:12:37] need to do that. You don't need to do
[1:12:38] that." And he says, "No, I do need to do
[1:12:41] that." and he took it and and uh left it
[1:12:44] at his lawyer's office and and the
[1:12:46] lawyer wasn't there, but he called him
[1:12:48] and said, "Um uh when I'm done reading
[1:12:50] your contract, you can come back and get
[1:12:52] it, and what I will do is all the parts
[1:12:55] that are directly against you, I will
[1:12:58] just strike a line through them." He
[1:13:00] goes back a couple days later, picks up
[1:13:02] this contract. First page, everything is
[1:13:05] struck out. Second page, everything's
[1:13:07] struck out. Third page, everything's
[1:13:09] struck out. Fourth page, a couple things
[1:13:11] left. Fifth page, sixth page, seventh
[1:13:13] page, eighth page, and he says, "This
[1:13:16] guy, whoever gave you this contract is a
[1:13:18] thief."
[1:13:19] &gt;&gt; And I'm telling you, my brother and
[1:13:21] sister, when we have the word of God,
[1:13:23] and you start to compare what Satan is
[1:13:25] telling you about your life, and you lay
[1:13:27] it down before our advocate, Amen, you
[1:13:30] will find that page after page of
[1:13:32] Satan's promises are struck out. Amen.
[1:13:36] And that's because he is a thief and a
[1:13:38] liar. Amen. He's come to kill, steal,
[1:13:40] and destroy. But the word of God, my
[1:13:42] brother and sister, Satan can say this
[1:13:45] part ain't relevant. But he doesn't have
[1:13:48] the gumption to actually be able to
[1:13:50] prove why.
[1:13:52] &gt;&gt; All he can do is make the accusation.
[1:13:57] And if we listen to the accusation,
[1:14:01] we've been deceived. That's right.
[1:14:08] &gt;&gt; So, a man that has all the word of God,
[1:14:10] but he cannot trust it is a defeated
[1:14:12] man. Actually, now let me put this in
[1:14:15] Mark 9 and 23. We'll just look at this
[1:14:18] real quick. Now, the scripture tells us
[1:14:21] not to change a single word, but I just
[1:14:23] want to make a point with you so you'll
[1:14:25] understand. I'm not trying to change it,
[1:14:27] but make a point. I believe in the right
[1:14:30] context that trust is fully
[1:14:34] interchangeable here.
[1:14:37] Will you read that real quick and just
[1:14:38] put the word trust in there instead of
[1:14:40] belief?
[1:14:44] Jesus said unto him, "If thou can trust,
[1:14:48] all things are possible to him that
[1:14:52] trusts."
[1:14:55] Are you with me? Do do you understand
[1:14:56] what point I'm trying to make? Not
[1:14:58] trying to change this scripture at all,
[1:15:00] but you see, my brother and sister, if
[1:15:02] you believe it, you can trust it.
[1:15:05] &gt;&gt; And if you can't believe it, you can't
[1:15:07] trust it.
[1:15:08] &gt;&gt; So, what we need to do is not really get
[1:15:10] down to worrying about all these other
[1:15:12] factors, maybe we need to stop and focus
[1:15:15] on it. Do I really trust God?
[1:15:18] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:15:19] &gt;&gt; Would I really give him my all and all
[1:15:22] and trust what direction he would take
[1:15:24] me from there? or do I still want to
[1:15:28] have my hand on the steering wheel? You
[1:15:31] know, I've said this before. I say it
[1:15:32] with a little humor, but it's got a good
[1:15:34] basis to it. Some some music singer a
[1:15:38] few years ago come out with a song,
[1:15:40] Jesus Take the Wheel. And and many of
[1:15:44] you probably never heard that. I just
[1:15:45] heard it in a certain circumstance. You
[1:15:47] know, Jesus take the Wheel. My brother
[1:15:49] and sister, the problem is is we give
[1:15:52] him the wheel, but we've got the clutch,
[1:15:53] the brake, and the throttle. Amen. We
[1:15:56] want to go when we want to go. We want
[1:15:58] to do what we want to do. We want to do
[1:15:59] it how we want to do it. However slow,
[1:16:01] however fast, you haven't really trusted
[1:16:04] God. You got to give it all to him. You
[1:16:07] got to let go of IT AND SAY, "LORD, I
[1:16:09] GIVE YOU MY LIFE and you are in control
[1:16:12] of it now."
[1:16:15] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:16:17] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:16:19] So once before we go on here, Jesus said
[1:16:22] unto him, "If thou canst trust, all
[1:16:24] things are possible to him that trusts."
[1:16:27] &gt;&gt; I believe that with all my heart. Amen.
[1:16:30] That if I don't trust him, there's no
[1:16:32] way I can say I believe him.
[1:16:33] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:16:34] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:16:36] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:16:38] &gt;&gt; Had a man tell me once, he said, "Oh, I
[1:16:40] trust this man so much. I could just
[1:16:43] leave my wallet on the table and be
[1:16:45] fine." And it wasn't me, but I was
[1:16:47] thinking it. Another guy says, "Just go
[1:16:49] ahead and leave your wallet there."
[1:16:50] Well, this guy always went around with a
[1:16:51] big fat wallet full of money. I trust
[1:16:54] this guy so much I'd leave my wallet
[1:16:55] here. Prove it.
[1:16:56] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:16:59] &gt;&gt; No, I'm not going to prove it.
[1:17:01] &gt;&gt; Then you didn't really believe it.
[1:17:04] &gt;&gt; That's it.
[1:17:04] &gt;&gt; If you can't trust it,
[1:17:05] &gt;&gt; that's right.
[1:17:07] &gt;&gt; You can't really believe it.
[1:17:13] Now, in the sermon, a man running from
[1:17:15] the presence of the Lord.
[1:17:18] &gt;&gt; I like this. I hope you don't mind if I
[1:17:21] inject just a tad bit of humor this
[1:17:23] morning. But when I come across this, I
[1:17:26] I just felt humor. Hopefully that
[1:17:29] doesn't offend anybody.
[1:17:31] Something like I was told one time a
[1:17:33] lady said back in the horse and buggy
[1:17:34] days said the horse ran away with her
[1:17:37] going from church said what did you do?
[1:17:40] Said I trusted the Lord until the lines
[1:17:42] broke.
[1:17:45] Well that's the time to trust the Lord
[1:17:48] &gt;&gt; after the lines broke. You're trusting
[1:17:51] in the lines until they're broke.
[1:17:54] &gt;&gt; Amen. That's right.
[1:17:56] &gt;&gt; Exactly right.
[1:17:58] Hopefully I'm not too blunt this
[1:17:59] morning, but what are you trusting in
[1:18:02] today?
[1:18:02] &gt;&gt; Right there. Ask it again.
[1:18:04] &gt;&gt; That is the truth.
[1:18:06] &gt;&gt; We can trust in our youth and our
[1:18:07] strength until we're no longer young and
[1:18:10] no longer strong.
[1:18:12] &gt;&gt; But the day we really should learn and
[1:18:14] develop what you might say is the habit
[1:18:16] of trust is when we're young. Then when
[1:18:20] we're old and weak,
[1:18:21] &gt;&gt; that's it.
[1:18:22] &gt;&gt; We have no question in our life about
[1:18:24] what it is that we trust. Amen.
[1:18:26] &gt;&gt; Amen. We ought to solidify these things
[1:18:29] while we are strong and capable and
[1:18:32] understanding to be able to know that
[1:18:35] when the finish line comes, our future,
[1:18:38] Amen, our eternity is anchored,
[1:18:41] &gt;&gt; not to come to the time or the place
[1:18:43] that we are worried about what it will
[1:18:45] be. I I've shared this with a church in
[1:18:48] times gone by, but there was a friend uh
[1:18:50] that was a friend of Joe's and and we
[1:18:52] went there and the man had had cancer
[1:18:55] and was on morphine and we had to go a
[1:18:58] couple times because he he whenever he
[1:19:01] would get in so much pain they give him
[1:19:03] morphine. And from there he just was
[1:19:04] out. And we we by God's grace got there
[1:19:07] one day and he was right in that perfect
[1:19:10] picture of of between, you know, his
[1:19:12] pain and being uh over done on the
[1:19:15] morphine. And I sat down on the side of
[1:19:18] his bed with him. And in just a few
[1:19:21] weeks from the time we met him, he had
[1:19:23] deteriorated so incredible it was
[1:19:25] shocking.
[1:19:27] And he looked at me and he says, "Paul,
[1:19:31] I want to do whatever you tell me."
[1:19:35] That's trust.
[1:19:38] &gt;&gt; I could have patted him on the shoulder
[1:19:39] and said, "Hey, you've done all of this.
[1:19:42] You've done that. You're good."
[1:19:44] But you see, one day we have to face
[1:19:46] these words that we would speak. We have
[1:19:48] to face the Lord with what we have given
[1:19:51] and spoke and ask people to trust in.
[1:19:54] And I just started at the very beginning
[1:19:56] and went through the whole pattern and
[1:19:58] the whole thing and coming down to
[1:20:00] salvation. And he was there and he
[1:20:03] looked at me, tears just pouring out of
[1:20:05] his eyes. He said, "Would you pray for
[1:20:07] me?" And I said, "No, I won't."
[1:20:10] &gt;&gt; And he was like, "What do you mean?" And
[1:20:13] I said, "This is a prayer you have to
[1:20:15] make. This is a expression that you have
[1:20:19] to speak to the Lord." And he says, 'But
[1:20:22] I'm not sure I know the words.' And I
[1:20:24] said, 'I might coach you on the words,
[1:20:26] but I believe the Lord will give you the
[1:20:27] words.' And that man prayed through
[1:20:29] right there.
[1:20:30] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:20:31] &gt;&gt; Amen. [snorts] I sat right there on his
[1:20:33] bed, Sister Jerry, right there with his
[1:20:35] wife, and he prayed through on that. And
[1:20:38] his wife's testimony after he passed
[1:20:40] away is from that moment, my brother and
[1:20:43] sister, not a day or two, a week, A
[1:20:45] MONTH, A YEAR. FROM THAT MOMENT, HE
[1:20:47] NEVER ONCE CRIED OUT AGAIN, "WHERE AM I
[1:20:50] GOING? It's dark. WHERE AM I GOING?
[1:20:53] &gt;&gt; AMEN. AMEN.
[1:20:54] &gt;&gt; Right there, CHRIST COME DOWN, SETTLED
[1:20:56] [laughter] that question in in his life.
[1:20:58] And he said, his wife said when he took
[1:21:01] his last breath, HE HAD A BIG SMILE ON
[1:21:04] his face because he had told her, "I now
[1:21:06] know where I'm going."
[1:21:09] &gt;&gt; Amen. My brother and sister, that's
[1:21:11] trust. He wasn't trusting Paul. Amen. I
[1:21:15] spoke the words, but he had to believe
[1:21:17] those words. HE HAD TO ACT ON THOSE
[1:21:19] WORDS. AND WE HEAR THE words today. Are
[1:21:22] we going to act on them?
[1:21:24] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:21:25] &gt;&gt; Or are we going to offer an alternative
[1:21:27] to it?
[1:21:28] &gt;&gt; That's exactly right.
[1:21:29] &gt;&gt; An explanation.
[1:21:30] &gt;&gt; Right.
[1:21:31] &gt;&gt; You see, it all comes down whether we
[1:21:32] trust or not.
[1:21:34] &gt;&gt; That's right. [snorts]
[1:21:35] &gt;&gt; This lady that he's quoting there,
[1:21:38] she was trusting God as long as she was
[1:21:40] in control of that horse. But when the
[1:21:43] line broke, [snorts]
[1:21:45] &gt;&gt; doesn't really say what she did from
[1:21:46] there, but I'm assuming she got a little
[1:21:48] bit anxious.
[1:21:54] &gt;&gt; Trust oursel.
[1:21:58] &gt;&gt; How could we trust ourselves?
[1:21:59] &gt;&gt; Exactly.
[1:22:00] &gt;&gt; Born in sin, shaped in iniquity, come
[1:22:03] into the world, speaking lies,
[1:22:05] &gt;&gt; our only way out is the blood of Jesus
[1:22:08] Christ.
[1:22:10] My brother and sister, we need to come
[1:22:13] to the place that we quit saying, "I
[1:22:15] believe," unless we're going to act on
[1:22:17] it.
[1:22:18] &gt;&gt; We're not really believers if we're not
[1:22:20] willing to act on the word. [snorts]
[1:22:22] &gt;&gt; We need to come along and say, "You know
[1:22:24] what? I believe this and it's not
[1:22:26] fitting in my life right now, but I'm
[1:22:28] going to change my life to fit the word
[1:22:31] of God."
[1:22:32] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:22:33] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:22:33] &gt;&gt; Amen. And I hope I'm not being too too
[1:22:36] blunt, but I think there's a point in
[1:22:38] time we have to just, you know, as the
[1:22:39] old phrase goes, we have to pay the
[1:22:41] fiddler. Amen. I I just rather pay the
[1:22:44] fiddler right now while I'm able to pay
[1:22:47] the fiddler than to come to a place in
[1:22:49] my life
[1:22:50] &gt;&gt; that I can't pay the fiddler.
[1:22:52] &gt;&gt; And I owe him.
[1:22:53] &gt;&gt; That's it.
[1:22:56] [snorts]
[1:22:58] &gt;&gt; You see, spiritual warfare will bring
[1:23:00] you to a showdown. Period. Yeah.
[1:23:03] &gt;&gt; I don't care what church we go to, how
[1:23:04] many generations of our family have been
[1:23:06] in that church. Amen. A spiritual
[1:23:08] showdown will bring you and I
[1:23:10] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:23:11] &gt;&gt; to a showdown. Bring us to a place that
[1:23:13] warfare. And it'll all come down to a
[1:23:16] simple phrase. It's more complicated
[1:23:17] than this. I understand. But it'll bring
[1:23:20] us to that place.
[1:23:22] Do I trust?
[1:23:23] &gt;&gt; That's it.
[1:23:24] &gt;&gt; Or not.
[1:23:24] &gt;&gt; That's it.
[1:23:26] &gt;&gt; Yep. Amen. And if I trust,
[1:23:30] see the scripture, Jesus said, "I'll
[1:23:32] lead you,"
[1:23:34] as they always jokingly say, "We're
[1:23:36] sheep.
[1:23:38] I'll lead you
[1:23:42] into all truth."
[1:23:43] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:23:45] &gt;&gt; Do we believe him?
[1:23:46] &gt;&gt; Absolutely right.
[1:23:47] &gt;&gt; Do we trust him?
[1:23:48] &gt;&gt; Amen. That's right.
[1:23:49] &gt;&gt; Then what were we worried about?
[1:23:50] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:23:51] &gt;&gt; Whether or not we're going to somehow
[1:23:52] get pulled off to the side.
[1:23:54] &gt;&gt; Right. Amen. You can't when you have a
[1:23:56] one-on-one relationship with Christ.
[1:23:58] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:23:59] &gt;&gt; Amen. He can't fail you. He doesn't lie.
[1:24:01] He's never lost a battle. Why don't we
[1:24:04] just simply believe him? Amen. And just
[1:24:07] step forward. Amen. I'm not talking
[1:24:09] about getting radical. I'm not talking
[1:24:11] about jumping off on the deal, you know,
[1:24:13] like the uh person, you know, says, "I I
[1:24:16] I'm just going to believe, you know, uh
[1:24:18] to to my healing or whatever and I won't
[1:24:21] go." And something simple turns into
[1:24:23] something complicated. And then they
[1:24:25] turn around and blame God. But God says,
[1:24:27] "You know what? Here's the answer. Amen.
[1:24:30] You can go. It's you're not backslid if
[1:24:32] you see a doctor."
[1:24:33] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:24:34] &gt;&gt; Amen. Now, out in the world we live in,
[1:24:36] we have some friends and whatnot that
[1:24:38] are just adamant that you have just
[1:24:41] forsaken your salvation if you go to a
[1:24:43] doctor. I'm sorry, my brother and
[1:24:45] sister. Jesus did not condemn the woman
[1:24:48] with the blood issue. Amen.
[1:24:50] &gt;&gt; He didn't tell her, "You backslid woman,
[1:24:53] repent first and then it'll heal you."
[1:24:55] But she had faith that touching the hymn
[1:24:58] of his garment would heal her. Amen. And
[1:25:01] there's where we're at. If we need a
[1:25:04] physician, then we know the great
[1:25:05] physician. And we trust the great
[1:25:07] physician, but we also been by God's
[1:25:10] grace given real physicians and the
[1:25:12] natural side here, doctors.
[1:25:15] &gt;&gt; So you look at this, my brother and
[1:25:16] sister, Satan loves to confuse.
[1:25:19] &gt;&gt; Amen. He wants to leave the people not
[1:25:22] knowing what to trust.
[1:25:24] &gt;&gt; That's exactly right.
[1:25:26] &gt;&gt; Exactly right.
[1:25:29] &gt;&gt; Do we have a certain sound or not?
[1:25:31] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:25:32] &gt;&gt; God has given a sound. He's given us a
[1:25:35] certain sound. It's called his word.
[1:25:37] It's called his voice. The Holy Ghost
[1:25:39] speaking to us is a certain sound. We
[1:25:42] don't have to walk through life. Do I am
[1:25:44] I saved or not? Do I am I do I have the
[1:25:46] Holy Ghost or not? Would God heal me or
[1:25:49] not? My brother and sister, he said it.
[1:25:52] He'll do it. You need to trust him.
[1:25:54] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:25:55] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:26:03] &gt;&gt; Natural or spiritual, have any of you
[1:26:05] had a mind battle?
[1:26:09] &gt;&gt; [snorts]
[1:26:11] &gt;&gt; Did you know that a mind battle
[1:26:15] I offered myself up as a guinea pig to
[1:26:18] life?
[1:26:21] And I'm telling you, I would rather work
[1:26:24] 12 hours physical all day than to have a
[1:26:28] mind battle.
[1:26:30] Because at the end of a 12-hour day of
[1:26:32] hard work, you go home, you eat supper,
[1:26:35] you take a shower, you go in, you don't
[1:26:37] even say good night, you just and you're
[1:26:40] out. But if you go a day, 12 hours of a
[1:26:43] mind battle, you eat supper, you take a
[1:26:46] shower, you climb in bed, and you lay
[1:26:48] there for hours staring holes in the
[1:26:50] darkness of the trouble that's in your
[1:26:53] life and the trouble that's around you,
[1:26:54] of the words that were said and what you
[1:26:56] failed or what someone failed you. And
[1:26:58] that mind battle will just drag you on
[1:27:00] and on. And you get up in the morning
[1:27:02] and you'll be tiredder than when you
[1:27:03] went to bed.
[1:27:05] &gt;&gt; Oh yeah,
[1:27:06] &gt;&gt; there's the mind battle.
[1:27:08] &gt;&gt; No wonder Satan loves mind battles
[1:27:11] because you see, he gets to then exert
[1:27:13] control. When you have a son of God that
[1:27:16] works hard,
[1:27:18] as I described already,
[1:27:21] prays, goes to bed, he wakes up in the
[1:27:24] morning refreshed,
[1:27:26] maybe a little sore,
[1:27:30] but when you go through a mind battle,
[1:27:33] when you do finally wake up or do
[1:27:35] finally go to sleep and then wake up in
[1:27:37] the morning, the battle's right there
[1:27:39] raging again.
[1:27:44] I personally know people who have quit
[1:27:46] serving God.
[1:27:47] &gt;&gt; That's it.
[1:27:48] &gt;&gt; Because they let the mind battle
[1:27:51] &gt;&gt; rule their life.
[1:27:55] &gt;&gt; Satan told them, "You made a mistake."
[1:27:59] I had a friend, he says, "I just can't
[1:28:01] do it, Paul. Why?" Well, I just find
[1:28:04] myself all the time just telling these
[1:28:06] little lies. Oh, hopefully this doesn't
[1:28:11] spook anybody here.
[1:28:14] At that time in my life, I just looked
[1:28:15] him in the face and said, "Me, too."
[1:28:18] He's like, "What do you mean you two?" I
[1:28:21] wasn't a preacher then, in case that
[1:28:22] makes a difference.
[1:28:29] What do you mean? And I said, "Exactly
[1:28:31] that. I find myself exaggerating to the
[1:28:33] point that even elastic can't survive.
[1:28:38] and then realized that was called a lie.
[1:28:42] &gt;&gt; Well, what did you do about it?
[1:28:45] I found me a private place in time and
[1:28:47] said, "Lord, forgive me."
[1:28:49] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:28:50] &gt;&gt; And I got up and I walked away knowing
[1:28:51] that the blood of Jesus Christ covered
[1:28:54] that.
[1:28:55] &gt;&gt; No battle going on. Did it. Is it
[1:28:58] capable? I did it again. I did it again.
[1:29:00] I did it again.
[1:29:03] Will it cover it? I did it again. Will
[1:29:05] it cover it?
[1:29:07] &gt;&gt; I'm here to tell you it will cover it.
[1:29:10] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:29:11] &gt;&gt; You stay in the battle.
[1:29:13] &gt;&gt; Don't let your mind rule you.
[1:29:15] &gt;&gt; Let your heart, let the Holy Ghost rule
[1:29:17] you.
[1:29:18] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:29:20] &gt;&gt; So you look at this, my brother and
[1:29:21] sister.
[1:29:24] Mental preoccupation is what some
[1:29:26] medical people call that.
[1:29:29] &gt;&gt; It's not anxiety.
[1:29:32] It's mental preoccupation.
[1:29:37] And it will leave you exhausted
[1:29:40] &gt;&gt; and it will erode your faith
[1:29:42] &gt;&gt; to where you're not even sure God is
[1:29:44] real.
[1:29:45] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:29:47] [snorts]
[1:29:48] &gt;&gt; 2 Timothy 1:7.
[1:29:54] For God hath not given us the spirit of
[1:29:56] fear, but of power and of love, and of a
[1:30:01] sound mind.
[1:30:03] Look how all of those go together.
[1:30:05] &gt;&gt; Amen. When you come to the place that
[1:30:07] you do not have fear, but you have a
[1:30:10] spirit of power upon you, not your
[1:30:12] power, but the power of the Holy Ghost.
[1:30:14] Amen. And that will then change you to
[1:30:16] where you love everyone around you. And
[1:30:19] then you will find that when you come to
[1:30:20] that place with such confidence in what
[1:30:22] God is doing, your mind settles right
[1:30:25] down of who you are and why you're here.
[1:30:29] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:30:31] Not to be morbid, but another man that I
[1:30:33] knew that was dying.
[1:30:37] And the question he had is, "What am I
[1:30:40] doing here?"
[1:30:44] 80 years old, still trying to figure out
[1:30:48] why am I even on this earth?
[1:30:54] Well, I can tell you I have an answer to
[1:30:57] that.
[1:30:58] We're here today to prove the word of
[1:31:01] God.
[1:31:02] &gt;&gt; We're here to prove that God's word and
[1:31:05] his Holy Spirit is true [snorts] and
[1:31:07] he's in control and he can take this
[1:31:09] whole physical body, this old emotional
[1:31:11] body, this old mental body, and he can
[1:31:14] bring it subject to the word of God and
[1:31:16] bring us to a place that we can walk out
[1:31:18] as the scripture would show us very
[1:31:20] clearly and be able to come boldly to
[1:31:22] the throne of God. Amen. Nothing unclean
[1:31:25] can come into the throne of God. But God
[1:31:27] can bring you and I to the place we have
[1:31:29] such confidence that we will go boldly
[1:31:32] to the throne of God because we know
[1:31:34] that the power of the blood is greater
[1:31:36] than any other spirit and any other
[1:31:38] mark. Amen. They talk about, oh, this is
[1:31:41] a permanent marker. I had a friend prove
[1:31:43] this to me. I said, oh, this is a
[1:31:44] permanent marker. And he says, no, it's
[1:31:47] not. And I said, well, it says it is. He
[1:31:49] said, I don't care what it says. He went
[1:31:51] over to his rig back in my painting days
[1:31:54] and um and he goes to his rig and he he
[1:31:56] got uh uh xyol xylene and he poured some
[1:32:00] on a rag and that permanent marker was
[1:32:03] no longer there cuz somebody had walked
[1:32:05] through a house we were building and
[1:32:07] took a permanent marker and every so
[1:32:09] often just
[1:32:11] I don't think they were doing it because
[1:32:12] they liked us.
[1:32:15] It's like what are we going to do? And
[1:32:18] he said, 'We going to just walk through
[1:32:19] there. Happened to be a Christian and
[1:32:23] just like the blood of Jesus Christ.
[1:32:27] It's no longer there.
[1:32:30] &gt;&gt; We can trust Zylene, but we can't trust
[1:32:32] the Lord.
[1:32:33] &gt;&gt; That's it.
[1:32:33] &gt;&gt; Come on, saints.
[1:32:35] My
[1:32:37] &gt;&gt; That's it. [snorts]
[1:32:40] &gt;&gt; I got too much here. I must have been
[1:32:42] really You know how you go shopping when
[1:32:44] you're hungry? You push the card out,
[1:32:46] it's $500 Costco special.
[1:32:51] You get home and you find out you do
[1:32:53] have 10 boxes of macaroni already. Yeah.
[1:32:57] So, don't go shopping when you're
[1:32:58] hungry, but come to church when you're
[1:33:00] hungry.
[1:33:01] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:33:02] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:33:05] See, Galatians 6:8-10 says, "For he that
[1:33:08] sweth to his flesh shall of the flesh
[1:33:11] reap corruption, but he that sweth to
[1:33:13] the spirit shall of the spirit reap life
[1:33:17] everlasting." Now, I remember a brother
[1:33:20] one time preaching on this and he says,
[1:33:22] "Now is a moment of decision. Are you
[1:33:24] going to sew to the flesh or you going
[1:33:26] to sew to the spirit?" That's all that
[1:33:29] matters this morning, saints. I know
[1:33:31] that's simplified, but all that matters
[1:33:33] this morning, what are we going to sew
[1:33:35] to? What are we going to sew our
[1:33:37] thoughts to? What are we going to sew
[1:33:38] our actions to? What are we going to sew
[1:33:41] our support to? We going to sew it
[1:33:43] through the flesh because the flesh
[1:33:44] makes us feel good, or are we going to
[1:33:46] sew it to the spirit and then reap what
[1:33:50] this spirit would give us.
[1:33:51] &gt;&gt; Exactly. Right.
[1:33:53] &gt;&gt; Let us not be weary and welloing. For in
[1:33:55] due season, we shall reap if we faint
[1:33:57] not. As we have therefore opportunity,
[1:34:00] let us do good unto all men, especially
[1:34:02] unto them who are of the household of
[1:34:04] faith.
[1:34:04] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:34:05] &gt;&gt; Now, I want to just touch on this real
[1:34:07] quick here. And I might abbreviate this
[1:34:09] rest of this service. Amen.
[1:34:13] It says, "Let us not be weary and
[1:34:15] welloing."
[1:34:16] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:34:17] &gt;&gt; Now, if you go labor hard, you can be
[1:34:18] weary in the flesh. There's nothing no
[1:34:21] reproach there. There's nothing. You You
[1:34:24] drive all day. Even something as in
[1:34:26] innocent as just driving all day.
[1:34:29] Amen. We got brothers in the church here
[1:34:31] that drive for a living. I know what
[1:34:33] they're talking about. I know how they
[1:34:34] feel. You know, 600, 700 miles behind
[1:34:39] the wheel of a truck. You didn't do one
[1:34:42] physical thing all day, but just twitch
[1:34:44] the steering wheel and you're tired.
[1:34:49] But what happens when we become
[1:34:52] spiritually
[1:34:53] weary? That's it.
[1:34:57] &gt;&gt; We face little setbacks in our life.
[1:35:02] We judge ourselves too harshly.
[1:35:05] We put it on the altar,
[1:35:08] but we pick it back up again.
[1:35:11] &gt;&gt; After a while, you become weary.
[1:35:14] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:35:15] &gt;&gt; The question, if Jesus came today,
[1:35:21] would he come for me or not?
[1:35:24] If you don't settle that, that will eat
[1:35:25] on your mind for years.
[1:35:31] And I hate to be so open in this sense,
[1:35:33] but I want to drive this point home. I
[1:35:35] had a grandfather, actually a
[1:35:36] stepgrandfather,
[1:35:38] wonderful man.
[1:35:41] Wonderful man.
[1:35:44] And as a kid, I would ask him, you know,
[1:35:46] kids sometimes we don't have any more
[1:35:48] sense than to just say things.
[1:35:51] and ask him, "Grandpa, why don't you go
[1:35:53] to church? Why don't you you you say
[1:35:55] that you used to serve God? Why don't
[1:35:56] you serve God?"
[1:35:59] And one day we're sitting in a boat,
[1:36:03] middle of a little lake over in Oregon,
[1:36:05] Analopee Reservoir out of Jordan Valley.
[1:36:09] And he told me,
[1:36:11] "Paul,
[1:36:16] I tried to do the things that the
[1:36:19] preacher told me about.
[1:36:23] I tried and I tried and I tried and I
[1:36:26] tried and I tried
[1:36:30] and I just couldn't seem to do it.
[1:36:33] So, I gave up.
[1:36:39] My brother and sister, don't let the
[1:36:42] devil bring you to a place where you
[1:36:45] become so weary in your spirit
[1:36:49] that the devil says you realize it'd be
[1:36:51] easier if you just gave up.
[1:36:57] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:36:59] &gt;&gt; Some of our founding fathers of the
[1:37:01] country made statements like they were
[1:37:04] cold, wet, many wounded soldiers hungry.
[1:37:07] And they said, "We have not yet begun to
[1:37:12] fight."
[1:37:13] &gt;&gt; Let that be the anointing on you and I.
[1:37:16] No matter what's happening in your life
[1:37:18] today, just rise up and say, "I have not
[1:37:21] yet begun to fight."
[1:37:23] &gt;&gt; Because Satan would like to just wear
[1:37:25] you down.
[1:37:26] &gt;&gt; And part of that wearing down is because
[1:37:28] we didn't leave it at the altar.
[1:37:30] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:37:31] &gt;&gt; We didn't actually believe God would
[1:37:33] take care of that for us. So, we took it
[1:37:36] home and gnawed on that bone oursel
[1:37:41] &gt;&gt; for a while. But I'm telling you, the
[1:37:43] meat's gone from the bone. It don't
[1:37:45] matter how much you gnaw on it, you're
[1:37:47] not going to get meat. You're going to
[1:37:48] get a bone.
[1:37:50] &gt;&gt; And we're not here. Amen. As the
[1:37:52] scripture says, amen where the carcass
[1:37:55] is.
[1:37:55] &gt;&gt; That's it.
[1:37:56] &gt;&gt; The eagles will be gathered. God didn't
[1:37:58] toss us a bone and say no on that for a
[1:38:01] while. He said the carcass of my word is
[1:38:04] here. Come feast on it. Sister Ruth, if
[1:38:08] you would come. Amen. God bless you,
[1:38:11] saints. Maybe a little straightforward
[1:38:12] this morning. Forgive me if I was over
[1:38:15] straightforward.
[1:38:16] But you see, my brother and sister, if
[1:38:18] we're going to fight the good fight,
[1:38:19] you've got to stay in the fight.
[1:38:21] &gt;&gt; And Satan wants to bring us to a place
[1:38:23] that we're we're weary.
[1:38:25] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:38:26] &gt;&gt; We're weary.
[1:38:27] &gt;&gt; Things didn't work here. Things didn't
[1:38:29] work there. I prayed and God never
[1:38:32] answered. Well, he more than likely did
[1:38:34] answer. We just didn't listen.
[1:38:36] &gt;&gt; Cuz sometimes a no from God is better
[1:38:39] than a yes from the devil.
[1:38:41] &gt;&gt; Amen. So, let's not get weary in this.
[1:38:44] Let's look at this, my brother and
[1:38:46] sister, according to the word. Amen. And
[1:38:49] realize we have a position
[1:38:53] as Christians, as believers, as the
[1:38:55] scripture calls us, Revelation 19, the
[1:38:57] lamb's wife. We're the bride. Amen.
[1:38:59] We've got a position in this battle.
[1:39:02] Amen. And when it come down to that time
[1:39:04] just a a thought you know [music] when
[1:39:06] when Esther come all that happened there
[1:39:09] in the book of Esther when Esther come
[1:39:11] into the throne room
[1:39:13] the king didn't say okay this has been
[1:39:16] done well Esther [clears throat]
[1:39:20] go talk to the armorer and get you a
[1:39:23] sword get you a shield buckle on a
[1:39:26] little armor go find Hmon in an alley
[1:39:28] somewhere slay him and then they will
[1:39:31] make a threat to the rest of those
[1:39:33] people. No sir, what was it? The king
[1:39:36] says, "By my decree,
[1:39:38] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:39:39] &gt;&gt; By my decree,
[1:39:40] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:39:41] &gt;&gt; we will subdue this issue. By my decree,
[1:39:44] we will stop this."
[1:39:46] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:39:46] &gt;&gt; By my decree,
[1:39:47] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:39:48] &gt;&gt; My brother and sister, that's what God
[1:39:50] wants us to do. He doesn't want us to be
[1:39:52] the battle axe bride. He wants us to be
[1:39:55] the bride that says, "I know how to
[1:39:57] fight this fight. I'll go boldly to the
[1:40:00] throne and my father, my husband will
[1:40:03] take care of this situation. [music]
[1:40:06] Hallelujah. Look, I'm talking about
[1:40:08] everything from our children.
[1:40:11] We don't got to wait till they grow up
[1:40:13] and start having troubles to start
[1:40:15] laying this word in and come right up
[1:40:17] through high school. Young people, you
[1:40:19] you need get a good grade on a test.
[1:40:22] Amen. Your father Amen. Our Lord Jesus
[1:40:25] Christ cares about your grades. Amen. If
[1:40:28] you will trust him and commit it to him
[1:40:30] and say, "Lord, I need help. I'm not
[1:40:33] sure I can even pass this test. Lord,
[1:40:35] I've tried, but I I can't seem to." If
[1:40:37] you'll just trust him and you go in
[1:40:39] there prayed up as a young person,
[1:40:41] you'll take that test and you'll come
[1:40:42] out with a good grade. And you'll be
[1:40:44] there sitting there, oh, I suddenly had
[1:40:46] recall. No, by the grace of God, you'll
[1:40:49] realize God heard your prayer and you
[1:40:51] are trusting enough to come to him and
[1:40:54] say, I need your help. marriages that
[1:40:56] have problems, my brother and sister.
[1:40:58] You can go to every counselor there is
[1:40:59] on the face of the earth, but if you
[1:41:01] don't trust God, you're going to still
[1:41:03] have trouble. Amen. So, it's better to
[1:41:06] go and say, "Lord, we submit. Husband,
[1:41:08] wife, we submit to you, AND WE'RE GOING
[1:41:10] TO TRUST YOU TO REMEDY THIS BECAUSE YOU
[1:41:13] DON'T TEACH DIVORCE."
[1:41:16] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:41:18] &gt;&gt; But what do we do? We've got all kinds
[1:41:20] of psychologies and this and that and
[1:41:22] whatever. Everybody's got an answer to
[1:41:24] every situation.
[1:41:26] [snorts]
[1:41:26] &gt;&gt; My brother and sister, it's time for us
[1:41:28] to trust the Lord.
[1:41:30] &gt;&gt; Amen. [clears throat]
[1:41:30] &gt;&gt; Amen. Look at the world we're living in.
[1:41:34] Hallelujah.
[1:41:36] You know,
[1:41:38] I say this a little bit light-hearted.
[1:41:41] [snorts]
[1:41:43] We're no longer living in the day when
[1:41:46] you are going to hear the Roman hear
[1:41:49] their armor clanking as they march.
[1:41:51] [music]
[1:41:54] We're living in a day.
[1:41:57] Oh, this might cause some of you to get
[1:41:59] nervous.
[1:42:01] [snorts]
[1:42:01] I'll say it anyway. Pray for you. We
[1:42:04] live in a day the government knows more
[1:42:06] about you than you know about yourself.
[1:42:08] [music]
[1:42:09] &gt;&gt; Absolutely.
[1:42:11] &gt;&gt; And if you don't think, as the scripture
[1:42:12] say shows us very clearly, that they
[1:42:15] can't come and just put a halt to this,
[1:42:17] [music] they can fly into another
[1:42:18] country, steal a president. Amen. Maybe
[1:42:22] rightfully so. I'm not going to argue
[1:42:24] whatever on that. They can go into
[1:42:26] another country and steal a president
[1:42:27] and most the country never knew it
[1:42:29] happened.
[1:42:29] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:42:31] &gt;&gt; You think the rapture is going to be on
[1:42:33] the evening news?
[1:42:34] &gt;&gt; No.
[1:42:36] &gt;&gt; No. And even if it was, you wouldn't be
[1:42:38] there to see it.
[1:42:41] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:42:42] &gt;&gt; That's [music] exactly right.
[1:42:43] &gt;&gt; Can we just maybe step up a little more
[1:42:45] to just trust the Lord?
[1:42:48] &gt;&gt; Lord, I'm here. Could you lift a hand
[1:42:49] maybe from your heart and just say,
[1:42:50] "Lord, help me to trust you. I want to
[1:42:53] trust you, Lord. I I need to trust you.
[1:42:56] I want your word to be so real in my
[1:42:58] heart that I never have a doubt ever at
[1:43:02] any point that you are leading me and
[1:43:05] guiding me." Hallelujah. Hallelujah.
[1:43:09] We'll stop there. Amen. [snorts] Let's
[1:43:11] just stand and sing a song or two if you
[1:43:13] don't mind.
[1:43:15] Amen.
[1:43:17] [snorts]
[1:43:18] 953.
[1:43:22] Let this be from our heart. Amen.
[1:43:24] [snorts] Hallelujah.

[1:44:55] hand and say, "Oh, the things he's done
[1:44:57] for me." He's done great things.
