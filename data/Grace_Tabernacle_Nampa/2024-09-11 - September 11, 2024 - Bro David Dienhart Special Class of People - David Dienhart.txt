to come expecting you're going to get what you expect amen you come to critical criticize you're going to get it you'll I'm sure God will Satan will point I should say out something you can criticize amen you come to receive the word then pull on the gift not pull on David not pull on the man pull on the gift that God has given through the ministry amen it's God's gift it's God's dress wear did you know that amen you want to be clothed with the word of God and take heed to the word that's ministered amen for the hour amen amen so if you'll pull he'll speak you operate it I can give myself all I want to the word but you have to operate it you've got to pull and say Lord I'm hungry speak to me speak to me you know I believe he can speak to you personally and that's what he should do I believe this message has spoken to each one of us individually personally amen amen while you're standing uh I just good to be here and be in the service of the Lord and it's always always a joy to be in the house of God you know this may be taken from us very soon you can see in every hand you know we see judgment striking the Earth you believe that amen you see it every man doesn't know what's happening they can't figure it out and but we know what's happening amen but we're here in the midst of all this struggle and trouble we're here to receive the Lord's Lord's word and to have it revealed to us it's got to be revealed and the only one that can reveal it is him amen so while you're standing I'd like you to turn to St John have scriptures here tonight tonight I don't have very much but we know that little is much when God is in it so we know that he can make little much and so my title tonight is the light of the life part two the light of the life part two and I had part one and uh if you recall we showed there where when we read this scripture here in St John that uh you were his witness before the foundation of the world you were with him in the beginning and in his thought amen so let us read here in St John 1 beginning with the first verse in the beginning was the word and the Word was with God how was it with God as is thought where were you in that thought you were existing you were real in the thought can't hear me well you may have to turn it up a little bit brother if they can't hear me I'm I'm a little bit horse tonight so I didn't say I was a horse I'm a little horse tonight amen don't get it wrong now and say David said he was a horse I wonder what kind well you're going to call me a horse call me a white horse would you amen so all right but I but I'm a little horse so in the beginning was the word and the the word was with God and the Word was God Amen that thought expressed was God and it was with him and and that's where you became expressed so you're in the word to begin with if you're his bride the same was in the beginning with God verse three all things were made by him and without him was not anything made that was made in him was life and the life was the light of men in him was life would that be Eternal certainly would because he can't be anything else but eternal life there's only one form of eternal life that's right so in him was life and the life was the light and so when you see life manifested it is light of men the light shineth in darkness watch and the Darkness comprehended it not they can't comprehend the light they can't comprehend the manifestation of the Life of Christ but the bride thrives on it amen I'd like you to turn with me to Matthew chapter 14 or chapter 5 excuse me Matthew Chapter 5 and verse 14 ye are the light of the world a a city amen find over Revelations 21 that she's a city the bride is the city amen and you are the light of the world a city that is set on a hill cannot be hid the Lord amen neither do men put a light do men light a candle and put it under a bushel but on the Candlestick and it giveth light unto all that are watch in the house I wonder what house that would be Lord see we each one are light to those in the house and let your light so shine let your light so shine before men that they may see your good works and glorify your father which is other words they will see the life manifested and glorify your father which is in heaven Isaiah 60 verse one very familiar scripture I still hear people turning pages so we'll wait a minute here Isaiah 60 arise he's speaking to someone here who's is he speaking to is he speaking to you this morning this evening he's speaking to his bride arise rise up rise arise amen Resurrection life amen arise Shine for thy light is come and the glory of the Lord is risen upon thee amen Ephesians chapter 1 I know that quite a few scriptures but I don't intend to take long here Ephesians chapter 1 we never intend to like I said little is much when God is in it I know God's in it Ephesians 1 verse one Paul an apostle of Jesus Christ watch by the will of God not the will of man to the Saints which are at Ephesus and to the faithful in in not not with not but in notice that word in and to the faithful in Christ Jesus Grace be to you and peace from God our Father and from the Lord Jesus Christ blessed be the God and father of our Lord Jesus Christ who hath past tense already blessed us with all spiritual blessings can you receive that tonight amen all spiritual blessings in heaven ly places in Christ that's the believer's position according as he ha chosen Us in him before the F where did he choose you in who him now who's going to take you out of him that's right if he chose you in him okay of before the foundation of the world that we should be holy and Without Blame before him in love having predestinated plac this is a pre-planning a predetermination having predestinated us by forn knowledge unto the adoption of children that's the placing of the adoption or the maturity of himself as a son amen children by Jesus Christ to himself according to the good pleasure me of his will to the praise of the glory of his grace see it's Grace are you saved it's Grace wherein he hath made you accepted he had made us are you one of us accepted accepted in the Beloved already accepted well if I could just be accepted you're already accepted I'm speaking to the bride tonight amen you're already accepted all right in the Beloved in whom in whom the Beloved we have Redemption through his blood the Forgiveness of sins according to the riches of your works his grace amen amen you didn't earn it you couldn't build yourself up to it it's his grace that saved you it's his grace that called you it's his grace that predestinated you it's his grace that chose you in himself amen accepted in the Beloved Grace amen I want to my subject here tonight is this a special class of people a special class in the message uh let's let's turn over me you can be seated let's turn over with me to Psalm Psalms 1 I want to read this I could just read what the prophet said and I will in just a minute what he said about this Psalms 1 blessed 1:1 blessed is the man that walketh not in the the counsel of the ungodly nor standeth in the way of Sinners nor sth in the seat of the scornful a lot could be said with that right there but his Delight notice his Delight is in the law or the word of God of the Lord and in his law doth he meditate day and night and he shall be like a tree planted by the rivers of water one water that bringeth forth his fruit in his season his Leaf also shall not wither and whatsoever he doeth shall prosper the prophet said this he said see some fell down in that Valley there Valley of persecutions hard trial some of them see fell in there in the valley of persecution hard trials be called everything like like the Lily was called B above made fun of it wasn't set out he said that that seed wasn't set out he said it was planted Hallelujah he said it was planted what predestinated that thought of God that thought of God now I can't go back and preach number one again so we got to go back that thought of God the bride is that thought of God thought of who God himself was the thinking of himself you are the thought of himself prise the Lord amen being manifested here in this hour in this day in this time you are the word word living manifested He said that thought of God before the foundation of the world that thought was planted predestinated that thought of God before the foundation World placed him there placed him where in that Valley in that by the rivers of water planted him when were you brother B said when when did he put that seed in you before the world began before the foundation of the world he said he planted it put it in you you didn't put it in you he put it in you if that's not in you you can't go reach out and try to get it and put it in you it's already there and so something has to meet that bring it to life amen all right so he placed him there see not stuck out he wasn't stuck out not by chance but was planted predestinated to the rivers of one of one water oh his root shall not wither his root shall not wither oh Hallelujah there he dies I'll raise him up again at the last day though excuse me I'm not there he died though he dies though this one dies in in in flesh I'll raise it I'll raise him up again at the last days see you can't kill the seed of God you can kill the body but you can't kill the seed then who are you which are you are you the seed amen you can you say I'm well I'm the body but it passes away but if that seed's not there it'll never rck again so the seed had to be there amen all right I'll raise it up again the last days that's right you said he said or brother brand referring to you said Lord you said I the Lord hath planted it I the Lord hath planted it why certainly you put it on the Lamb's Book of Life before the foundation of the world I the Lord hath planted it I'll Water it day and night unless some should pluck it from my hand so what's it going to take it's going to take that seed in you planted for you to be in the Rapture amen for you to be in the bride that seed has to be planted in you before the world began amen all right amen so it's not it's not another person it is the it is him the person in seed form planted in you now it's got to come to life in its season this is your season amen amen you're in seed time you're in the bride time you're in the bright age this is your season all right I the Lord that planted it I'll Water it day and night look who's caring for it he said I'll Water it day and night oh yeah you think he's able to carry out his promise you think he's able to carry out his word doesn't look like there's too many does there but he's going to do it he has his elect for this hour this day that's going to Manifest this day and this hour amen because they have an ability to hear the word of God for the season all right and that here is to know and to hear and to receive what the spirit's saying you know know what he's saying no one no one else does she does he does the seed does amen amen no one else has that ability amen you can hear it a lot of people hear it but they don't see it I don't talk about hear see here I'm talk about see with their heart they don't see it why don't they see it or other words they can't receive it they can't receive it and they're good people wonderful people even people will be saved at the Judgment were that kind of people but they aren't in the bride because they can't come through the blood the only thing that can come through the blood is his life is his seed that's it okay keep that in mind I want you to turn with me to St John three I was going to read this a little later here but I'll just read it right now St John 3 and starting with verse three this Jesus is meeting Nicodemus we know the story we've read it but in starting verse Jesus answered and said unto him verily verily I say unto you now he just got done saying there's no man can do these works we know there's no man can do these works except God be with him but then so Jesus answers and said answered and said unto him verily verily I say unto you except a man be born again he cannot see that word see there is not physical sight right it's the understanding the revelation of the kingdom of God and except he be born again and that word Born Again means literally from above except a man be born again or from above he cannot see the kingdom of God the kingdom of God is the word which is God made life and spirit power in your life that's the kingdom of God so the kingdom of God is the word made Power made life in you amen all right we could we could find that in 1 Corinthians 4 if you were wanting to look it up all right so he said no man can see the kingdom of God except be born again and so so Nicodemus saith him how can a man be born when he is old see he's got his mind on the on the on the flesh man he he said how can this be he's only got one birth in sight and that's a natural birth Jesus wasn't speaking of the natural birth here amen because if he's born of God it wouldn't it would not be a a natural it would have to be a spiritual birth because God is a spirit that right sure he brings forth the natural it's a law but but he the the birth comes from the spoken word the birth of God the birth or Born Again comes from the word spoken amen and that's exactly what he was God was with Jesus because he was the word the spoken word made manifest he didn't come through woman he never came through flesh sex he wasn't born of Flesh he was born of God you say well he was a man yes he was he came through a woman but he didn't come by sexual he didn't come by man's he didn't come by man or by sensation of man he came by the spoken word and if you're born again you'll come the same way by Spoken Word not not born in a through a woman virgin like he was but the spiritual birth inside of you is a word spoken in its season made manifest in you because that word spoken goes to you go and will go to that seed and then the word meets the word amen all right so you so if you have 2 plus two if the word meets the word what are you going to have the word amen all right so he said so we go on reading here verse six or five verily verily I say unto you except the man be born of water and of the spirit he cannot enter into the kingdom of God now that's God's word you just you can't come in any other way that which is born of the flesh is flesh but that which is born of the spirit I Jesus is bringing this right down Clarity but that which is born of the spirit is spirit that which is you can't divide you can't separate God from his word God and His word are the are one you'll never divide them or separate them wherever God is the word is amen amen well you say what about the tribulation Saint what about what about those that see they have the don't they have the word yes but they only have it as an intellectual understanding not Revelation okay we'll we'll just speak of that maybe if as we go here just shortly in verse eight in verse 7 he said Marvel not that I said unto you you must be born again the watch this eth verse the wind the wind what is the wind typing the Holy Spirit okay the wind bloweth where it listeth I want to I want to cover these words here in just a few minutes few just in a moment the BL the wind bloweth where it listeth and thou hearest the sound thereof but cannot tell whence it cometh or whether whether it goeth now watch what he says so is everyone that is born of the spirit kind of strange they're kind of unusual to the Natural man the flesh man because he cannot discern that Spirit unless he has that spirit of God in him can't receive it all right so so now hold that right there I'm not going to read any further if we go to First Corinthians and you don't have to turn here just want to listen I want to go to 1 Corinthians the 15th chapter and it says here in the 45th verse through 48 it says so it is written the first man Adam was made a living Soul the last Adam though you should have first Adam now the second Adam the last Adam is made what a quickening spirit yes remember he that's born of the spirit is Spirit right all right okay then it goes how be it that was not first which is spiritual but that which is natural and afterward that which is spiritual the first man is of the earth earthy the second man is the Lord From Heaven amen the second man the birth from above is the Lord From Heaven right amen all right now how be it that was not okay it was spiritual okay then from Heaven 48 as as is the earthy such are they also that are earthy and is see Jesus said the same thing you're born of flesh is flesh as is the Heavenly such are they also that are that such are they also that are heavenly so see where' you come from from above a Heavenly you are a Heavenly being you brother brandom said you are an eternal being inside and the inside is going to produce that outside amen going to bring it to the outside you're going to be changed and what's Heavenly in you you you were you started in heaven you came from heaven and now you're dwelling in heaven yeah inside well I don't feel like heaven out here but you quit looking at this you'll realize where you're at okay so there's a Heavenly being here right here in this Tabernacle this evening birth word the birth word is a Heavenly being it's the Holy Ghost it's the word himself all right I only had to read the yeah well I'll just go on and as we have borne the image of the Earthly we shall also bear the image of the Heavenly now I say Brethren that flesh and blood cannot inherit the kingdom of God neither do corruption inherit incorruption and then he says I'll show you mystery we're not all sleep but we shall be changed amen now in the me in the church age book The Prophet said and I'll come back to these meanings here in the e8th verse here just in John 3:8 yes Church age book He said Yes Satan hates Revelation Satan hates it but watch what he's butt we love it amen who loves the Revelation because the revelation of the word can the Gates of Hell cannot Prevail against a true revelation of the word remember Jesus said himself I'll build my church upon the revelation of who I am that's why the new birth is the revelation of Jesus Christ has begun in you and will grow into the very person himself because that's the person you are that person amen all right and and the Holy Spirit came down in this day the message was sent to Quicken to Quicken or bring alive resurrect that person in you all right now Satan hates Revelation but we love it with true Revelation in our lives the Gates of Hell cannot cannot Prevail against us hallelujah but we will we will prevail over them amen now brother sister bride you have an anointed position prise the Lord when you recognize your position that you are the word living and in action there's not a devil at any time at any place under any circumstance can stand up against that as long as you hold that before him amen amen he can't do it you can go back to the word and say it's written of me go back to the word and say this word right here is the revelation of who I am amen it's a full revelation of Jesus Christ and I'm part of that full Revelation the Lord yes sir and he cannot be complete until she comes on the scene today because you being that seed quickened in this hour reveal manifesting the promised word of the hour because you have an ear to receive and hear it amen it's revealed to you the gates of hell can't Prevail against that amen there's no way it can stand against it you're going to go on you're moving on what's leading you the pillar of fire just like our brother brought Sunday what is is it that you are you're that living fire you're that Living Word you are that shakina you go in there the prophet said on the unveiling of God he was trying to show who the bride was they're the unveiling of God see because that unveiling makes you the complete revelation of the whole thing the revelation of God in you makes you the complete revelation of the whole thing the complete revelation of Christ am amen you see where we're at amen right and so so here he said you will recall he says that I mentioned at the beginning of this message that this book we are studying which is the Book of Revelations is the actual revelation of Jesus himself in the church and his and and it is his work in the future ages his work let your light so shine amen that they may see your Works whose works is it is it David's Works no it's his work it's his works and will'll glorify what David no they'll glorify your father because is your your life is testifying light to them that this life is manifested now present living in flesh Jesus Christ the same yesterday and today and forever amen all right and he saidou recall so we see he said his work in the future Then I then I mentioned that it takes the Holy Spirit to give us Revelation or we will fail to get it right how does faith come by hearing the word amen he said bringing these two thoughts together you will see that it won't take just ordinary study and thinking to make this book real ordinary study and thinking it's going to take the operation of the Holy Ghost it's going to take the operation of the Holy Ghost if you hold that operation and see it operating in you what kind of evidence and what identification do you have who is what is your identification all right see operation of the Holy Ghost that means this book cannot be revealed what is this book the Lamb's Book the bride book The Book of Life the Lamb's Book of Life he said this book cannot be revealed to anyone but a special class of people so now you see where my my subject is a special class they're the ones that receive that receive the Revelation they are the ones that receive the revelation of the hour and the day you don't have to pump that up it's in them to be it it's in them they they hear the voice they're going to respond to the voice other words we just read here in St John 3:8 that and that the wind bloweth where it list and thou hearest the sound thereof thou hearest the sound some will hear the sound and don't know where it come from they'll hear the sound but can't can't receive that sound and that sound is a voice even the Greek meaning of it was voice all right so so he he goes in to say he said it'll take this means the book can't be revealed to anyone but a special class of people it will take one with prophetic insight it will require and here's it is right here you have bride you you bride you elect of God you seed of God you that have been accepted in the Beloved you that have been chosen in him before the foundation world how do you know Brother David because it's revealed to me in the word and Vindicated thus it's already it's already proven because it does I don't have to make it happen it lives itself amen it will take one with prophetic Insight it will require the ability to hear from God you have the ability to hear from God not everybody has that ability only the bride has that ability to hear from God and when you hear from God when you see it when you hear it the word dovetailing itself coming together and hearing what the spirit's saying you can't produce and give that to somebody else right not unless they have that seed in them then you speak that revelation we speak that voice we speak that sound and they can hear that because Jesus said my sheep hear my voice and a stranger they'll not follow see so it's coming to a special class of people it will take it will require the ability to hear from God it will require prophetic Insight it will require Supernatural instruction not just a student and you know you say well you get pressured up well I got to find that instruction I got no you're trying then just feed on the open book ask God to open it to you ask God to reveal it to you you don't have to pump it up and work it up and Chase it down it's right there for you ask God to open it to you if you have it in you you're going to want to feed on this open book you're going to want to know what it's saying you're you can't stay away from it it's it'll be an everyday it'll be an everyday cleansing an everyday opening it'll be Quicken more and more and your walk will be higher and higher and higher until you're out of here like Enoch amen right exactly right you're walking in the light you see the message is God is light actually I didn't even intend to read St John 1 1-5 but I did you know what my scripture was first John 1 1-5 God has his way let's go to First John because now's the time to read it let's go to First John 1 that that which was from the beginning which we have heard there it is you see oh I love the way God does things that's all there is to it it goes beyond the man goes beyond man's ideas man's thinking man's intellect it's the working and achievement of God himself when you realize that bride you're released you're free there's no such a thing is being under bondage he has not given you the spirit of bondage but he's given you the spirit of adoption full adoption full placing brother BR listen we have the message we have the Capstone Ministry to cap off the Pyramid of your life amen that's exactly right amen bring you to the very person you are Lord and your position is that person you have no other position you have no other place of worship but in that person amen hallelujah all right so let's read again that which was from the beginnings 1 John 1:1 which we have heard which we have seen with our eyes which we have looked upon and our hands have handled of the word of life for because or for the life was manifested and we have seen it and bear Witness and show unto you that eternal life which was with the father and was manifested unto us that which we have seen and heard there you are Glory declare we unto you that you also may have fellowship with us and truly our fellowship is with the father and with his son Jesus Christ so where do you stand in this the complete revelation of the godhead amen that's right that's exactly right amen he's not perfect without a bride father son Holy Ghost you know what brother Bram said about father son holy ghost in you he said father son bride amen all right truly our fellowship was with the father with his son Jesus Christ this then this is what brought it back here this then is the message yes this then is the message to a special class of people that he said Rise and Shine for thy light what is the message God is light then who are you God is light and he just got done saying you're the light this then is the message you're the light amen amen you're the light how because he planted that seed and you were ordained for this day and you can't miss it there's I don't care I you will not miss it it's impossible to miss it no the bride will miss it she can't that's just all there is to it if if she misses it he missed it and his works are perfect all of his works are perfect and he said and you and he has made your all of his way is perfect excuse me all his way his works are yes of course but his way is perfect and he said he had made your way perfect amen all right so this is the message we've heard of him declaring to you that God is light and in him is no Darkness at all now we'll come to another scripture here in just a minute and I'm I'm not going to take too much longer here it is the Revelation no excuse me it will require Supernatural struction instruction not just a student comparing verse with verse though that is good but a mystery requires the teaching inside teacher can't you rely upon that inside teacher that has unveiled himself in you and you know it that's right amen yes sir you're identified he's an inside teacher amen and it'll it it's it and it requires the teaching of the spirit or it never becomes clear how we need to hear from God and lay ourselves open that's it right there how we need to hear from God and lay ourself on the altar lay yourself open and become yielded to the spirit to hear and know it is the revelation of God that will give you the authority over the devil it is the revelation of god notice the revelation of God revelation of who the revelation of God that will give you authority over the devil and you can see why they would they you can see why they who would add or take away from it would be cursed it would it would have to be so for who can add or take away from the perfect revelation of God and overcome the enemy it is that simple there is nothing of such prevailing power as the revelation of the word now let's look at this St John 38 let's take this word in St John 38 let me go back here to it John 3 John 38 oh I can't find it in Matthew okay 38 the wind bloweth where it listeth the word listeth means a will or desire a will of Mind a tendency a choosing of his mind is the will the lth mean it's under Direction the wind is under Direction it's directed The Wind where it'll blow where it listeth it means it's blowing where it's dire it's it's directed to go it h it's it's purposed it's determined according to his pleasure the wind will blow where it listeth where he wills it amen all right now you're under see you're you're under not flesh here carnal thinking carnal man you're led by the pillar of fire the Lord himself and then where it listeth and thou hearest the sound heareth heareth hearken and thou hearken and gives attendance to the sound consider what is or has been said hearing means considering attending to it and what has been said and the sound heareth the sound the sound is a voice speech language a tongue it speaks it's a voice if we go to 1 John 4:6 it said that the bride being born again has a voice amen and it's the voice of him we are of God we are of God verse 6 chapter 4 verse John 46 we are of God he that knoweth God heareth us there it is they hear the sound but they can't determine where it come from now watch because we're going on here let's just pick that up so they hear the sound and can't not tell discern or perceive where it went from where from where it's from or from what or how or why they don't know why where it's from what it's for or why whence it cometh and and do we see that today my yes they don't get it amen I'm not talking about the world out here they don't get get it either but we're talking about whether they have an ear to hear or not whether that seed's laying there the all perect you know all profess the message but what is it who is it amen it's living right here where is it living amen it's moving in his body it's moving in you in his house and so they cannot tell whence it cometh and whether it goeth whether is some where somewhere it's gone or about how it is or how it goes or where it goes about it they don't know about it so is everyone that is born of the spirit and so 1 John 4:6 said we are of God and he that knoweth God heareth us he that's not of God heareth not us hereby know we the spirit of truth and the spirit of error you mean there's a people like this in the land Brother David that would know perceiving hearing and knowing where that where that where that wind is blowing and where it's going and where it's come from and where it's going let's look at St John 8 here a moment St John chapter 8 and let's look at the 12th verse then Jesus spake again unto them saying I am the light of the world now I just got done saying he said I am the light of the world he said you are I am the light of the world other words what he is you are he that followeth me shall not walk in darkness see he that followeth me shall not walk in darkness but shall have the light of life the Pharisees therefore said unto him thou bearest record of thyself thy record is not true Jesus answered and said unto them though I bear record of myself yet I know yet my record is true for I know watch what he says here for I know whence I came I know where I've come from right take it over to St John 38 again I know where I've come from I know where that wind's Le blowing I know where it's leading me I know where it's come from I know where it's going amen it's on the move you you you realize the holy spirit's on the Move yes sir where are they moving where are they marching we're heading out of here we're marching and step with the word they're marching he saw them marching he saw them on the Move amen leaving here it's happening yes amen all right he said and then he goes on and says 14th verse then Jesus answered said though I bear record myself yet my record is true for I know whence I came and whether I go just exactly they don't know where he's come where it's come from and whether where it's going they hear it but they don't know the sound of it they can't discern they can't perceive the sound amen if you perceive and hear the sound and know the sound what is that saying to you as an individual all right then he says here the fif four 15th verse you judge after the flesh look at what what he went right back to him he said you're judging after the flesh he said I judge no man after the flesh I don't judge after the flesh if God judged us after the flesh we're done we're gone but he's not judging us after the flesh he morning a flesh is flesh you judge after the flesh you're looking at the flesh I don't judge after the flesh I judge the spirit I know my own they are my they are me that's me there all right I don't judge after the flesh all right now in the 23rd verse he said and they said and he said unto them you are from beneath I am from above ye are of this world I am not of this world neither are you neither am I I'm not of this world I'm from above I'm not boasting I'm a special person he made me that I didn't make myself that he made me that it takes a I mean I'm sorry I'm a special class I'm in a special class of people I belong to a special class and it's called The Bride amen I'll call you bride it went from church bride to bride amen all right now Jesus said himself you cannot hear my word Therefore your father he said right in verse 47 he said he that is of God heareth God's words ye therefore hear them not because you're not of God verse 43 why you do not understand my speech even because you cannot hear my word in every age there's been that original that seed that would be able to hear and respond and hear the word for that age amen they they could receive they heard the word for their age but they could not be made perfect until the seals were opened without us amen they couldn't be made perfect complete right until the Capstone unveiled itself amen and United with him and and then they with us are complete amen it's all one they lived out their time they lived out their age they they had that portion of the Holy Spirit to recognize to know the word for their season they were able to hear what the spirit said in that age in that time that's always been the True Believer all the way through until right till right this present time and they were never large in number they were small in number I don't know the number I don't concerned about the number I just know I am as an individual in that number and brother Ram if you don't have that Revelation you've got to have that Revelation he said if you don't have that Revelation how do you know amen if there's only one going to make it out of Jeffersonville I'll be that one amen because why it's revealed to me that I come from him I am him and I always will be him all right so my sheep hear my voice Cain could not receive the voice Cain heard the sound he heard God speak but he couldn't receive the voice he could not accept accept the sacrifice of blood it's exactly right he couldn't accept it he was told he if you would accept it you'd be all right but he couldn't accept it he he refused to make a uh or make or receive the sacrifice of blood he refused to make that sacrifice amen and nobody but nobody but the bride can come through the blood into the holiest of holies amen because there is where that shikina glory is there's where that pillar fire is the outside of that the fire is there but it runs out but he that has his vessel has oil in the vessel not just the lamp the vessel amen we'll always we'll always have the oil yeah amen that's right amen when you come into that second that second you pass from the first into the second uh uh place there in of the of the of the Temple of the of the Tabernacle you're you're right there very before the seven lamps but they run out of oil you can come in there and have a great meeting and everybody shout and praise the Lord and all get anointed by the spirit and go on out there and now they need another filling yeah and we need fillings I'm not questioning that but th they ran out the the lamps get black they run out you've got a other words the Levites had to come and keep pouring oil into it to keep them lit but once you ever go into that holiest of holies you don't have to do anything to keep it lit it's always lit amen it's always lit you find 10 10 F five foolish five wise virgins they all had lamps but one had their vessel full of oil and the other didn't and the oil and the word the word the Holy Ghost is the oil and the Holy Ghost is the word they can have an intellectual learning of the word they can be anointed by that spirit amen with me but they don't have the word in the vessel they don't have the Holy Ghost there they don't have that Spirit of Revelation be able to hear that word spoken that's the difference and they that were ready went in with him to the marriage when he opened the seals the first thing he did performed a wedding amen they that were ready they that had their vessel full of oil they that had the oil they had the word to be quickened the Holy Ghost come to Quicken that word and when the word was quickened what did it produce it was God himself living what's his name his name then is revealed you hold his name you have his name for you're United with him amen you see we could go to Matthew 25 you could read it they had lamp they had their lamp they could come into that second real sanctified people but they couldn't get the revelation of the day and the hour they're living in why because they weren't predestinated to that position they took their lamps they took no oil in the vessel they ran out well go buy some God was giving it when did he get it he gave it freely but they couldn't buy they couldn't manufacture something and go buy it and we're not going to give you ours because we got enough to go in you go get it other words you go get it where we got it yes they didn't the prophet said they didn't if you want to hear what he said he said they didn't get it that's what he said they didn't get it they went to get it and they didn't get it they couldn't get it because if they got it if that seed they weren't seed of God they were remnant of the life they were Remnant they weren't the seed amen amen amen they they couldn't if they were seed they'd go beyond they could go beneath they could go beyond the blood they could come through the blood how can you stop the seed from coming through the blood amen into his very presence because the prophet said this now watch he said this he said he's an eagle this Eagle now let's let's come to a conclusion first of all let's say this now then we are coming to a conclusion so are we we're closing as the Eternal logos was manifested in the Sun and Jesus dwelt G in G in Jesus dwelt all the fullness of the godhead bodily and that Eternal one was the father manifested in flesh and thereby gained the title of son even so we Eternal in his thoughts in our turn became the many membered spoken word seed manifested in flesh and those Eternal thoughts now manifest in flesh are the sons of God even as we as we are soall we did not become seed by rebirth we were seed and therefore we were reborn for only the elect can be reborn remember the scripture said he sent the spirit of his son in you Galatians 4 and because you are Sons he sent the spirit of his son in you to you in you quickened you quickened that seed brought it to life and the and the elect and therefore they were reborn for only the elect can be reborn only the elect can be reborn foolish virgins were not born again in fact they did not they did not have the Holy Spirit in that Soul dwelling oh they had the anointing they had the word out there on the outer on that outer side but not in there CU if they had it in there they would have had it to begin with in there amen are you with me and then in their age they would have received that word right because why I'm coming right to it here he said because they were seed is the reason they could be quickened in nonseed there's nothing to Quicken all right this eagle out here hunts for hunts for his mama he recognizes the real Eagle recognizes the call of God's word why he recognizes it why he's an eagle an eagle to an eagle an eagle to an eagle amen the word before the foundation the word to the word so it's the word coming to the word amen watch how he says it here he said the word predestinated to the word written for the hour you realize your position and you know what he's so running to obtain he hunts for it amen are you with me he hunts for it he doesn't set on a wire up there expecting to expecting some car to run over a dead kill a rabbit he's hunting for it he hasn't lost she hasn't lost her identification she hunts for it it's there it's in the word amen it's word coming to word the word predestinated there's a word written for this hour and the two meet yes it was already there it was already in the vessel amen the other didn't have it in the vessel amen all right I hope you understand all right now you recognize your position now let's go to Matthew and I'm closing Matthew 11 just about five more minutes 11 Matthew 11: I don't even know what time it is so forgive me if I run over your time you forgive me Matthew 11 I don't believe I'm running over God's time all right Matthew 11 verse 29 well let's just read verse 28 with it come unto me all you that labor and are heavy laden and I will give you rest now watch this take my yoke that word yoke just leaped at me take my yoke upon you and learn of me for I am meek and lowly in heart notice no self in that I am meek and lowly in heart yeah and you shall find rest unto your souls for my yoke is easy and my burden is l i g HT now they interpret as Li te you can say that both ways but in this case it's light all right because you're going to go through struggles and trials and it's not going to be easy you're bearing light and Satan hates the light all right so it's going to be you're going to carry a burden but you're yolked I want you to notice this and we'll come to a yoke a Yol is a chain a link a bond of connection as the Yoke of marriage the yoke is a couple a pair a couple a pair like two y oxen Yol together they work as one the bride and the bridegroom yolk together they work as one amen you're yolked with him take my yoke how I willing to say Lord give me the Yoke are you going to Bear persecution yes you can bear hard trials you're down in that you're down in that Valley see be misunderstood this when that you are is misunderstood this voice is misunderstood amen this this uh this wind moving through coming through led by the spirit is misunderstood human thinking would say oh it can't be that can't be him that can't be see okay a CH be careful what you say can't be amen all right now I now and a yoke to put a yoke on means to join in a yoke as to yoke oxen or a pair of oxen to couple a yoke means to couple to join with one another do you realize that every member of that body is joked with Christ they're one person every member is a member of that one head it's one person amen every member of body born of his Spirit can't be another person it is that person amen yolked now meekness meekness I love this meaning this is taken right directly out of the Greek meaning it said meekness toward God is that disposition of spirit in which we accept his dealings with us as good and therefore without disputing or resisting in the Old Testament the meek are those who relying holy relying on God rather than their own strength to defend them against Injustice thus meekness toward evil people means knowing that God is permitting the injuries they inflict that he is using them to purify his elect and that he will deliver his elect in his time amen gentleness or meekness is the opposite to self assertiveness and self-interest it stems from trust in God's goodness and control over the sit situation the gentle person is not occupied with self at all the meek are not occupied with self at all this is a work of the Holy Ghost not of the human will and the and the wind blowing where it listeth is his will it's his moving it's his doing he directs it he guides it and you're moving with it you're in it that's you being led being guided being directed amen and lowly means of low degree humble having a humble opinion of oneself crucifying self not self assertiveness amen not puffed up not pointing the people back at you amen but humble humble in mind humble in spirit humble having a humble opinions of oneself crucifying self that's what lonely means Jesus said if you'll follow me deny yourself take up your cross and follow me now brother sister I want to read something this is I'm closing I know I've said that but I am right now I want to read something taken out of the family altar book this is this is book if you have those books this is book this is book volume three he goes through the Psalms here but I want to take the quote and he took it out of Psalms 57 1-6 so he's quoting on that Psalm but let me read the quote you are Prophet speaking you are the light of the world a city that is set on a hill that cannot be hid and we tonight ought to be ashamed of ourselves and honestly and humbly confess our unbelief before God and ask him to forgive us of how we represent him in this life he's depending on us can you imagine that why would God depend on us you are his word Quicken you are the Quicken remember that one that's born to you is a new creature and it's the quickening spirit amen all right it's the Lord From Heaven all right the Old Testament people did not have this presence you're unaware you're unaware of that you refer back sometimes to Elijah to Moses let me read that again the Old Testament people did not have this presence you're unaware of that you refer back sometime to Elijah to Moses and those those people Moses and Elijah and those people were great men ordained of God but yet not the privilege that you have they haven't the privilege they did not have the power given them to perform as you have got yourself everything you have got yourself and what you have is everything that's in Christ for they foresaw this day embraced it and believed it and looked for it to come before it ever come now we're living right in it and afraid of it see what a privilege now if Satan's body can be operated by unbelief and doubts and fears will produce what the scripture says it will doubts and fears will produce what the scripture said it will amen that's quite a statement isn't it doubt what now he says let me I got to find back where I was here yeah doubt and will produce what the scripture says it will it'll produce sickness it'll produce disaster what will doubt and fears it'll produce all those things and then people by unbelieving produce that shouldn't people believing with the power of God harness them those things and bring them back to correction what did God redeem us for did you ever think what he redeemed us for why didn't he just make you the atonement and say now why didn't he just make you or bring to you other words make you the atonement and say now there's no need of giving them deep Powers there's no need in making this man a Son of God there's no need in doing that I will just I will just ask him to believe it write his name on The Book of Life and that settles it but he gave gave us these redeemed but he gave us don't miss that these redeemed blessings that we might operate the work of God by the energy of the holy spirit in St John 15 he said now that's the reason I read that about being yolked he said St John 15 said I am the vine you are the branches do you know that the vine can't bear fruit I'm going to let that soak a minute the vine can't bear fruit watch what he said although the fruit is in the vine but the fruit cannot be brought forth from a Vine it has to have the branch to Bear the fruit what's the complete Revelation then who's bringing forth the fruit it's the vine the fruits in the vine the energy is there but where is it going to be transferred to to the branch and what are they going to produce the genuine revelation of Jesus Christ for this day and season not the it's come out of the shook what are they going to produce Christ in Bride form he said it's got to have a branch to produce the fruit and you are the branches now the Vine with all of its energy cannot produce anything unless the branch is willing to receive the energy am now God is depending on you as a member of his body to Bear the fruit of his spirit and now if he's depending on you let's open up our channels and let the Holy Spirit come in tonight and energize us and free us from all these fears and doubts may God grant it let's Stand Together God bless you piano if Sister via would come I asked
