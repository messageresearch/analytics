[0:26] [Music]
[3:00] Heat. Heat.
[3:15] [Music]
[5:19] God bless you this morning. Amen. Good
[5:22] to be here. Good to be gathered together
[5:23] again.
[5:25] Amen.
[5:26] Good another opportunity to praise and
[5:29] worship our Lord Jesus Christ.
[5:32] Amen. Amen. I'd like to start with
[5:35] number
[5:36] 1016. He's in the
[5:39] [Music]
[5:46] house. Little girl was lying there.
[5:50] People all were weeping.
[5:55] They just laughed at
[5:58] Jesus. She's only
[6:02] sleeping. As he took her by the
[6:06] hand, she began to live
[6:10] again. Some began to praise the Lord.
[6:14] Some began to
[6:20] say, "He's in the house.
[6:25] Death has to
[6:27] flee. Now there is
[6:30] light where darkness used to
[6:35] be. Now there is
[6:38] hope. There's no more
[6:42] doubt. Praise his
[6:45] name. Praise his
[6:49] name. He's in the house.
[6:56] We were like that little
[6:59] girl dead in all our
[7:03] sin till Jesus touched this heart of
[7:06] mine and gave me life
[7:11] again. I'm just a house of
[7:15] clay. Ever since that blessed
[7:18] day, there's a light that shines on me
[7:23] for all the world to
[7:28] see. In the
[7:31] house death has to
[7:36] flee. There is
[7:38] light and darkness used to be.
[7:43] Now there is
[7:46] hope. There's no more
[7:48] [Music]
[7:49] doubt. Praise his
[7:53] name. Praise his
[7:57] name. He's in the
[7:59] [Music]
[8:01] house. He's in the
[8:05] house. Death has to
[8:08] flee. Now there is life.
[8:13] Where darkness used to
[8:16] be, now there is
[8:19] hope, there's no more
[8:23] doubt. Praise his
[8:27] name. Praise his
[8:30] name. He's in the
[8:33] [Music]
[8:36] house.
[8:37] Amen. Sorry, I got a my throat this
[8:40] morning.
[8:42] was fine until I got up here.
[8:45] Amen. Amen. Let's uh another song's been
[8:49] on my heart this morning. Number 444.
[8:51] What a day that will
[8:54] be. Amen.
[9:00] There is
[9:02] coming a
[9:04] day when no
[9:07] heartache shall
[9:10] come. No more
[9:12] clouds in the
[9:15] sky. No more tears to dim the
[9:20] eye. All is
[9:23] peace forever more.
[9:27] on that
[9:28] happy golden
[9:31] shore. What a
[9:33] day, a glorious
[9:36] day that will
[9:41] be. Oh, what a
[9:44] day that will
[9:46] be when my
[9:49] Jesus I shall see.
[9:53] And I look upon his
[9:57] face. The one who
[10:00] saved me by his
[10:03] grace. When he takes me by the
[10:07] hand and leads me through the promised
[10:13] land. What a
[10:15] day, a glorious
[10:18] day that will be.
[10:24] There'll be no more sorrow
[10:29] there. No more
[10:32] burdens to
[10:34] bear. No more
[10:37] sickness, no
[10:39] pain, no more
[10:42] parting over there.
[10:45] And
[10:47] forever I shall
[10:49] be with the
[10:52] one who died for
[10:55] me. What a
[10:57] day, glorious
[11:00] day that will be.
[11:06] What a
[11:08] day that will
[11:10] be when my
[11:13] Jesus I shall
[11:15] see. When I
[11:18] look upon his face, the one who saved me
[11:24] by his grave.
[11:27] And he takes me by the hand and leads me
[11:33] through the promised
[11:36] land. What a
[11:38] day, glorious
[11:41] day that will
[11:45] be.
[11:47] Amen. Amen. Number uh 422. Brother
[11:52] Paul's sermon the other night made me
[11:55] think of this song. The love of God. I
[11:57] love the last verse of this song. Could
[11:59] we with the ocean fill where the skies
[12:02] precious? I can't I used to love to sit
[12:05] out and look out at the ocean and just
[12:07] think of this this verse.
[12:10] And the interesting thing you know when
[12:13] when you could we would ink the ocean
[12:15] film you sit and look at the ocean
[12:17] that's only what you can see.
[12:19] And the love of God is so much more than
[12:21] what we can see or even understand.
[12:24] Amen. Amen. It's beautiful.
[12:28] Amen. The love of
[12:32] God is greater
[12:37] far than tongue or pain.
[12:42] can ever
[12:45] tell. It goes
[12:49] beyond the highest
[12:54] star and reaches
[12:58] to the lowest
[13:02] hell. The guilty
[13:06] pair bowed down with care.
[13:12] God gave his
[13:15] son
[13:19] to his airing
[13:23] child. He
[13:28] reconciled and pardoned
[13:32] from his sin.
[13:37] Oh love of
[13:40] God, how rich and
[13:45] pure, how
[13:49] measureless and strong.
[13:54] It shall
[13:57] forever more
[14:01] endure the saints
[14:04] [Music]
[14:06] and gel
[14:08] [Music]
[14:09] song when hory
[14:13] time shall pass away.
[14:19] and earthly
[14:22] throne and kingdoms fall.
[14:27] When men who
[14:30] hear refuse to
[14:34] pray on rocks and
[14:38] hills and mountains
[14:42] call God's love so
[14:45] [Music]
[14:46] sure shall still
[14:50] endure all measure le
[14:56] and
[14:58] strong redeeming
[15:02] grace to Adam's
[15:06] ray the saints and
[15:11] name gel
[15:14] song. Oh love of
[15:18] God how rich and pure.
[15:24] How
[15:27] measureless and
[15:31] strong it shall
[15:35] forever more
[15:39] endure the saints and
[15:44] name
[15:47] song. Could we
[15:51] within the ocean
[15:55] filled? And were the
[15:59] sky a parchment
[16:03] made? Were every
[16:07] star on earth a quill?
[16:13] and every
[16:16] man ascribe by
[16:19] trade to write the
[16:23] love of God
[16:26] [Music]
[16:28] above would drain the
[16:32] old shine
[16:35] dry. Nor could the
[16:40] scroll contain the
[16:44] whole though stretched from
[16:48] sky to sky. Stand and sing the chorus
[16:51] with me again. Love of
[16:56] God, how rich and
[17:00] pure, how
[17:01] [Music]
[17:04] measureless and strong.
[17:08] It shall
[17:12] forever more
[17:16] endure the saints and
[17:18] [Music]
[17:21] angels song.
[17:24] Oh love of
[17:28] God, how rich and
[17:32] pure, how
[17:36] measureless and strong.
[17:41] It shall
[17:44] forever more
[17:48] endure the saints and
[17:53] angels
[17:56] song.
[17:59] Amen.
[18:02] Hallelujah.
[18:05] Hallelujah. Take these hands
[18:10] [Music]
[18:13] Amen. Nothing without
[18:15] you.
[18:18] Hallelujah. Take these
[18:23] hands and raise them
[18:28] up. For I have not the strength to
[18:33] praise you near enough.
[18:39] I am
[18:43] nothing Lord. I am
[18:48] nothing without
[18:54] you. Take my
[18:59] voice and pour it out.
[19:05] Let it sing the songs of mercy. I have
[19:13] found I am
[19:18] nothing. I am
[19:22] nothing without you.
[19:29] And all my
[19:33] soul
[19:36] needs is all your
[19:41] love to cover me.
[19:47] Oh, all the
[19:50] world will
[19:54] see I have
[19:59] nothing without
[20:02] [Music]
[20:05] you. Take my
[20:10] body, build it up.
[20:14] [Music]
[20:15] faith be broken as an
[20:19] offering of
[20:23] love for I have
[20:28] nothing. Lord, I am
[20:31] [Music]
[20:32] nothing without you.
[20:40] Take my
[20:43] time here on this
[20:48] earth. May it
[20:50] glorify you all that you are
[20:57] worth. I am
[21:01] nothing. I am
[21:05] nothing without you.
[21:11] Take these hands.
[21:13] Hallelujah. Take these
[21:17] hands and lift them
[21:22] up. For I have not the strength to
[21:27] praise you
[21:31] near. Lord, I am nothing.
[21:37] I have
[21:41] nothing without
[21:45] you. Take my
[21:48] time. Take my
[21:53] time here on this
[21:58] earth. And let it
[22:01] glorify you. All that you
[22:06] were. Lord, I am
[22:11] nothing. I have
[22:16] nothing
[22:17] without
[22:18] [Music]
[22:21] you.
[22:23] Hallelujah. Praise his
[22:25] [Music]

[22:37] He's
[22:39] all I
[22:43] need. He's
[22:46] all I
[22:50] need.

[23:58] him. I will

[24:04] him in

[24:09] and in
[24:12] [Music]

[27:35] Amen. Let's

[27:43] Jesus. Oh
[27:45] God, how we love you, Lord
[27:48] Jesus. As we sang the words of the song,
[27:52] Lord Jesus, it always just gets me.
[27:55] Could we would thank the ocean fill,
[27:57] Lord, when I think of the goodness of
[27:58] God. We only see so much for goodness,
[28:01] but it's so much greater, so much
[28:04] larger. Our human minds can't
[28:07] even begin to
[28:09] comprehend the things that you do for us
[28:13] daily. And we thank you for those
[28:16] things, Lord Jesus.
[28:19] Lord, we thank you for the grace that
[28:21] you've shown us, Lord
[28:24] Jesus. And even the grace that we don't
[28:26] even know about, Lord
[28:28] God. Lord, you're so wonderful to us and
[28:31] we love
[28:32] you. Lord, truly, you are all we
[28:36] need. And Lord, as we come before you
[28:38] this morning, we just ask you, Lord, to
[28:42] just come down, Lord Jesus. Just be with
[28:44] us this morning, Lord. May you find it
[28:46] this service pleasing, Lord Jesus. Just
[28:49] each one, each heart, Lord
[28:51] God, Lord, focus solely on you this
[28:54] morning,
[28:57] Lord. Lord, as we've read these
[28:59] requests, the different
[29:01] ones, the different lives, the different
[29:03] situations, Lord
[29:05] Jesus, we dedicate them all into your
[29:07] hands. We commit them unto you, Lord
[29:09] God, knowing what your word has said
[29:11] about these things, Lord God. And when
[29:14] we give them back to you, Lord, we find
[29:17] that peace. And so we dedicate them unto
[29:20] you. We dedicate our lives unto you. We
[29:23] ask you just take this service, Lord.
[29:25] The the praise and worship this morning,
[29:27] the preaching of your word, Lord God,
[29:29] may it speak to each one just whatever
[29:32] they have need of this morning. Any
[29:33] hands that are lifted up, Lord
[29:36] God. Just ask you be with us this
[29:39] morning, Lord God. May
[29:41] you just love you, Lord
[29:44] Jesus. Just have your will, have your
[29:46] way this morning, Lord. May you speak to
[29:49] our hearts. We
[29:53] pray. Give you thanks in Jesus name.
[29:56] [Music]
[29:57] Amen. Amen. You may have your seats.
[30:05] [Music]
[30:08] Number 222. He's my
[30:11] Lord. There is no other
[30:17] one. He's my Lord.
[30:21] [Music]
[30:23] There is no other
[30:28] one who can
[30:32] calm the storms of
[30:35] life like my Lord.
[30:42] He gives
[30:44] rest to the
[30:48] weery. Gives new
[30:51] life to the
[30:55] hopeless. There's no
[30:59] doubt
[31:00] about it. He's my
[31:08] Lord. He's my Lord.
[31:13] There is no
[31:17] other
[31:20] one who can calm the storms of
[31:27] life like my
[31:33] Lord. He gives
[31:36] rest to the weery.
[31:41] gives new
[31:43] life to the
[31:46] hopeless. There's no
[31:50] doubt about it. He's my
[31:57] Lord.
[31:59] Amen. We ask our brother Paul to come
[32:02] this morning. I'd like to sing number
[32:03] 861.

[39:38] gentlemen? So sister Aaliyah graduated
[39:41] yesterday. It was wonderful on my own
[39:44] part as my own granddaughter.
[39:46] uh did so well in her studies that it
[39:48] made up for even her grandfather's lack
[39:51] of study years ago. So now we have a a
[39:54] passing grade all the way across the
[39:56] board. Uh brother Joe is also done
[40:00] wonderful in his studies and uh this
[40:03] coming week uh will be uh graduating
[40:06] also and uh moving on uh to others. Are
[40:10] we missing any graduates?
[40:14] Um I you know sometimes I I kind of
[40:17] forget get
[40:19] preoccupied. Um we want to remember
[40:22] hopefully this okay sister
[40:25] Alice. Uh oh I got the eye roll. I'll
[40:29] keep it simple. Sister Alice will be
[40:31] going away uh just for a period of time
[40:34] here for an internship and we want to
[40:37] remember her. Amen. in
[40:44] prayer, everything to her. Amen. And uh
[40:47] we appreciate Sister Alice. She's she's
[40:50] always just faithful, stalwart, and one
[40:54] thing I really appreciate is she's very
[40:56] forthright. If she's thinking it, and
[40:58] she will probably engage you to let you
[41:01] know, and I like that. Amen. So, uh, we
[41:05] want to remember Sister Alice as she is,
[41:08] uh, uh, going to be gone out of town for
[41:10] a bit. Amen. And I will connect with you
[41:14] and share what information we have.
[41:16] Amen. And, uh, Brother Sergey not here
[41:19] today. Sister Toma is with family, so
[41:22] that means she's on the other side of
[41:24] the world. Uh, and, um, Sister April not
[41:28] here this morning. But uh we've been
[41:31] conversing just a little bit and I would
[41:33] like to find a time Lord willing that
[41:35] Sister April would be able to share uh
[41:39] her experiences and I I don't know
[41:42] probably would be something we would do
[41:43] here at the church in the basement cuz
[41:46] that would give adequate space uh for
[41:50] for that. So uh be praying about that.
[41:53] Uh there's just a lot to hear. Amen. She
[41:56] has shared little glimpses here and
[41:58] there and and uh my brothers and
[42:01] sisters, we we sometimes forget I
[42:04] believe just how blessed we are. Amen.
[42:08] What God has done for us. We
[42:10] have our our challenges here. Uh but um
[42:16] you know the gospel uh is going to be
[42:20] spread one way or another. Uh St.
[42:24] Francis of Aiz says testify and this not
[42:27] exact words but testify of Jesus Christ
[42:29] and speak if you have to. So we're
[42:32] seeing that uh shared and just u want to
[42:36] uh let's see if I missed anything.
[42:40] Amen. Thank you very much musicians. I
[42:43] appreciated it. Um thank the Lord for
[42:46] for
[42:47] those.
[42:49] Amen. Let's turn in our Bibles this
[42:51] morning. I want to just speak on the
[42:53] countdown of the word uh part two. Uh
[42:57] and uh we would just uh turn in 2
[43:00] Thessalonians the first chapter verses
[43:03] 1-5. And um you know as we're seeing the
[43:06] countdown of the word uh coming to pass
[43:10] in our day, there will literally come a
[43:13] day, saints, now I think we ought to
[43:16] just really hold on to this. literally
[43:18] come a day that for the bride of Jesus
[43:21] Christ, time will be no more. That's
[43:23] right. It will be finished. It will be
[43:25] over. And people, you know, sometimes
[43:28] Satan uh he he uh uh he just wants to
[43:33] make everything such a challenge. He
[43:36] wants to throw every roadblock that he
[43:38] can. And we have to remember when you
[43:41] look through scripture that God tests
[43:43] with time. And so one of the one of the
[43:47] tests that we face now is that you know
[43:50] when is the coming of the Lord? Well to
[43:53] the bride of Christ she stands here
[43:55] today. He has already come. Amen. Amen.
[43:58] So we don't we don't have to pin our
[44:00] hope on some event in the future. But we
[44:04] can stand here today and we know that he
[44:07] has come and he is with us. Amen. He's
[44:10] leading. He's guiding. He said I'll
[44:12] never leave you. So he cannot say those
[44:16] words if he's not with you. And so he'll
[44:19] never leave you nor forsake you. And I
[44:22] say thank you Lord for that. 2
[44:24] Thessalonians 1 chapter verses
[44:27] 1-5. Paul and Sylvanius and Timoththeus
[44:31] and to the church of the Thessalonians
[44:33] in God our father and the Lord Jesus
[44:36] Christ. Grace unto you and peace from
[44:38] God our father and the Lord Jesus
[44:40] Christ. We are bound to thank God always
[44:44] for you, brethren, as it is meat,
[44:47] because that your faith groweth
[44:50] exceedingly.
[44:52] And the charity of every one of you all
[44:55] toward each other aboundeth. And I
[44:58] believe these are the things in evidence
[45:01] that we must see. We must see our faith
[45:04] growing. And we must have charity every
[45:08] one of us abounding. Amen. Not not just
[45:11] I had a moment of charity but it becomes
[45:15] who we are. It becomes the life that we
[45:17] have toward each other abound so that we
[45:21] ourselves glory in you and the churches
[45:23] of God for your patience and faith in
[45:26] all your persecution and tribulations
[45:29] that ye endure. So if they endured it
[45:32] then in the gospel of Paul the prophet
[45:34] said the gospel of Paul is alive and
[45:36] well in this day. another book of Acts.
[45:38] That means that you might as well settle
[45:40] in and accept the fact you're going to
[45:43] suffer persecutions and you're going to
[45:45] suffer tribulations. Amen. But remember,
[45:50] there are those things that work in you
[45:55] for the edification of the word in your
[45:58] life. Amen. Sometimes you need
[46:01] struggles. Yeah. You need trials. That's
[46:04] right. You know, we've all probably that
[46:07] have been around the farm, you know,
[46:09] thought we could help the little chick
[46:11] get out of his shell only to kill him.
[46:15] And so what we need to do is just settle
[46:18] down. And if it's a peck today and it's
[46:21] a pec peek tomorrow, know that God will
[46:25] deliver you from your tribulation. Amen.
[46:30] which is manifest token of the righteous
[46:33] judgment of God, that you may be counted
[46:35] worthy of the kingdom of God, for which
[46:38] ye also suffer. Heavenly Father, we
[46:40] thank you today to come. May the word
[46:43] just come speak to our hearts, Lord.
[46:45] Just anoint these lips to speak it,
[46:47] Father, in the fashion, Lord, that you
[46:49] would desire. Let it be a blessing to
[46:51] your people. For those who are not here
[46:53] today, Father, we just ask that your
[46:55] Holy Spirit would come speak to hearts,
[46:58] lead and guide and strengthen and raise
[47:00] up, Father. Lord, that we can come and
[47:03] stand with that faith and the virtue of
[47:06] the word in the hour you called us to.
[47:08] We are not here by mistake. It is not an
[47:11] accident. And so, Lord, if you placed us
[47:13] here, you already knew that we would
[47:15] overcome it. Lord, we want to be your
[47:18] overcomers. bless this time today in the
[47:21] name of Jesus Christ. Amen. You may be
[47:24] seated.
[47:26] Amen. Now, you know, we can look and
[47:30] um we can look and see a very clear
[47:33] timeline in the word as we go down
[47:36] through it. We'll find that we'll just
[47:38] use uh uh Israel and Egypt as a uh as a
[47:44] example of how that uh prophecy declared
[47:48] that they would spend 400 years in Egypt
[47:51] and and you know brothers it seems a
[47:54] little bit backfeed or something here.
[47:57] Uh and they would they would spend that
[47:58] 400 years. Now it didn't matter who
[48:01] thought that they could come and deliver
[48:03] them prior to that. And uh Pharaoh
[48:06] thought that he could make them his his
[48:09] servants slaves uh for for uh time and
[48:13] eternity, right? Just a never endless
[48:15] supply of young people rising up to be
[48:18] put into the workforce. And and uh yet
[48:21] when the word come and said the time is
[48:23] up, there was nothing going to stop
[48:25] Israel from being delivered. And so, you
[48:28] know, as we see how uh the story, as we
[48:32] well know, uh that uh they're told to
[48:35] take a lamb and uh they were told to eat
[48:39] the whole lamb. Not not to just eat the
[48:41] the most precious parts, the most tender
[48:44] parts, but to eat the whole lamb and to
[48:46] take and put the blood over the lentil
[48:48] of the door. And you see how when those
[48:52] things were put in place, they were
[48:54] spoken, they were going to come to pass.
[48:57] And my brother and sisters, the prophet
[48:59] brings it in the message, the token, uh
[49:02] it's there that uh that token must be on
[49:04] display. So it's not good enough to say
[49:07] I have the token somewhere in my house
[49:09] or in my office or library or wherever
[49:14] it might be, but it must be on display.
[49:16] And so it must be out where the world
[49:19] itself can see it. and and we're coming
[49:22] to a time that the word declares that uh
[49:25] we would see the word the entirety the
[49:28] fullness of the word we would see it
[49:30] come to pass. So therefore that must be
[49:33] on display but we also see prophecy that
[49:36] declares that there's coming a time when
[49:39] the wicked one amen would come and he
[49:41] would be on display. And you know, it's
[49:44] kind of interesting. I would use the
[49:46] word funny in a sense, but not in a
[49:48] humorous way, but how through the ages,
[49:51] remember, you know, when certain
[49:53] presidents were elected, they said,
[49:55] "Nope, there's the antichrist." Uh they
[49:58] said, "Oh, this is the antichrist over
[50:00] here." I can remember all the way back a
[50:02] lot of years ago, the internet was the
[50:04] antichrist. Uh and uh you know, in some
[50:08] ways, they're right. Uh but you look at
[50:10] this and there's always been this this
[50:12] is the antichrist and this is the
[50:14] antichrist. But the word said that he
[50:16] would come and the people would worship
[50:18] him. And so it's there that he's going
[50:20] to draw in or or pull in the people in
[50:24] their everyday life that they are
[50:26] comfortable with to give their worship
[50:28] to that. And so we see how the word is
[50:31] coming to pass my brother and sister.
[50:33] and the signs of the times. We could
[50:35] spend a, you know, probably weeks or
[50:37] months, you know, just going over the
[50:38] signs of the times. But one thing we do
[50:41] know that every sign that was prophesied
[50:44] is coming to pass and it is being
[50:47] brought before us. We're not here today
[50:48] to do a history lesson. And uh we're
[50:51] seeing how that these things are are
[50:54] spoken out and people uh they they are
[50:57] looking for these signs. But just as it
[51:00] was, my brother and sister, when Jesus
[51:02] come on the s scene, the prophecy of his
[51:06] coming was so uh before the people, it
[51:10] was recorded, it was spoke of, it was
[51:12] preached on and people were looking for
[51:14] that. But when it
[51:17] come, they completely miss it. Amen. Not
[51:20] everyone did obviously, but they miss it
[51:22] because they had interpreted what they
[51:25] thought was the sign of the coming of
[51:27] the Messiah. And let's be careful today,
[51:30] saints, that we do not misinterpret the
[51:33] signs of the coming of the Lord. Amen.
[51:35] That we look at the signs of the times
[51:38] and and don't get ourselves to the idea
[51:40] that we like the foolish virgin can run
[51:43] get oil at the last minute. Amen. But we
[51:47] need to have that oil because we see the
[51:50] signs. Not saying that we have exact
[51:52] interpretation of every sign that is
[51:55] coming or has been manifested that we
[51:57] can fully explain each and every one and
[51:59] how it dovetales. But what we know is it
[52:01] is coming. Amen. And if you know that it
[52:04] is coming my brother and sister then you
[52:07] need to be prepared. I need to be
[52:10] prepared. not doing. You know, we don't
[52:12] want to be like the people that dally
[52:14] for one more minute and then run to the
[52:17] gate expecting the airplane to still be
[52:19] there. Amen. When the door closes, they
[52:22] do not. This is a natural thing that
[52:25] really fits spiritually. When the door
[52:28] is closed, they don't open it again.
[52:31] That's right. And so, we need to be
[52:33] there, be prepared, be on board. Amen.
[52:36] And so we see this and we see how that
[52:39] there is I just listened to a little
[52:42] podcast uh and you know they're talking
[52:44] about when when we resolve the the
[52:48] conflict between uh Ukraine and Russia
[52:52] there'll be lasting peace in that area.
[52:54] But that's not what's prophesied. Amen.
[52:57] They say when we resolve these things
[52:59] with these countries, uh, you know,
[53:02] we're going to to take nuclear weapons
[53:04] away from Iran and there'll be peace in
[53:07] the Middle East. No, my brother and
[53:08] sister, that's not what was prophesied.
[53:11] Amen. And the prophet of God comes in
[53:13] the day that we live in. It still should
[53:16] be considered fresh mana to us. Amen.
[53:19] Don't look at the message as old mana.
[53:21] It is fresh mana. I'm telling you, you
[53:23] put on a tape or pick up a book and you
[53:26] read it and it is applicable to the very
[53:28] moment that we live in. And so you look
[53:31] at that and see as the word has come,
[53:35] we're seeing that people are saying,
[53:36] well, you know, we believe that this is
[53:39] going to happen. There's consolidation.
[53:41] I I've shared this before and typically
[53:44] I erase them or I would do this but I
[53:46] receive on a very regular basis the NPA
[53:50] ministerial association uh uh email that
[53:53] they send to me and inviting because
[53:56] they are working now to bring this is
[53:59] part of their deal to bring every church
[54:01] in Nampa in unity. Amen. And I tell you,
[54:05] my brother and sister, there are
[54:07] churches that we could come very close
[54:09] to agreeing with, but my brother and
[54:11] sister, there's only one absolute word
[54:14] of God. And if you're not on that
[54:16] absolute word, then you are not even
[54:19] close. Cuz this is not a case of close
[54:21] is close enough. Amen. And so, do you
[54:24] want to influence? Yes. Obviously, we
[54:26] would want to live a life and and be an
[54:29] example enough that would influence
[54:31] people. But my brother and sister, I'll
[54:33] just be blunt. There's many religions
[54:35] out here that are so completely false. I
[54:38] do not want to come in unity with that.
[54:41] I do not need to rub shoulders with them
[54:44] when they need to write their own Bible,
[54:46] when they need to have their own thing
[54:48] and they don't even bother to take it
[54:51] back to the word of God. They just
[54:53] simply have their own. And so it's there
[54:55] that we'll look at this. And when it
[54:57] comes these cries for peace and unity,
[55:00] my brother and sister, is actually a cry
[55:02] for peace. So right here in this city of
[55:04] Nampa, we have a cry for peace. Uh not a
[55:09] conflict or differences, but let's all
[55:12] come together. Salvation Army, Jehovah
[55:14] Witness, LDS, Catholic, Pentecostal,
[55:18] whatever it is, let's all come together.
[55:20] Let's work out our differences that we
[55:23] can then come in unity. I tell you what
[55:26] I want to do. I want to work out my
[55:28] differences with the word of God. In
[55:30] other words, my differences with the
[55:32] Lord Jesus Christ so that I can come in
[55:34] unity with the word. Amen. That's the
[55:37] unity I'm looking for. I don't need a
[55:39] unity with another man. I don't need
[55:41] unity with a program. I don't need unity
[55:44] with the masses or a consensus. I want
[55:47] to be in unity with the word. Can we say
[55:49] amen to that? Amen. And so there's cries
[55:52] in the world and certainly let's not
[55:54] let's not become hardened to the world
[55:57] we live in when we look at what is
[56:00] happening uh Ukraine uh and Russia that
[56:02] that conflict my brother and sister if
[56:04] you're a mother or a wife or a child in
[56:08] Russia you are crying for peace if you
[56:13] are a wife a mother a child in the
[56:17] Ukraine you are crying for peace let's
[56:20] not become hardened and draw lines
[56:22] there. The cry for peace is a real cry
[56:26] from the heart. And many a person is
[56:29] crying for peace. They're desiring peace
[56:31] in their life. They are disturbed today.
[56:34] They they are troubled in their spirit.
[56:36] They have no peace in their life.
[56:38] Tormented all the time. Their cries for
[56:41] peace are real. Amen. But there's also,
[56:44] my brother and sister, a very strong
[56:47] principle of scripture that when there
[56:50] is no seed, there is no growth. There is
[56:53] no life without the seed. Amen. And we
[56:58] don't point that to anyone. It's a
[57:00] simple fact of the word that it is
[57:02] there. If the seed is not there, you can
[57:05] put all the water you want. You can put
[57:07] all the sunlight you want. You will not
[57:09] make it grow. Amen. And so we'll see
[57:12] this. Amen. And another thing that must
[57:16] come in this day is the gospel must be
[57:18] preached to the ends of the earth. And
[57:20] we are seeing uh we could go into a
[57:23] whole testimonial here, but we are
[57:25] seeing incredible things happening. The
[57:27] the message itself reaching into the far
[57:30] corners of the earth and and how it's
[57:33] touching lives and how it gets there.
[57:35] I'm always amazed uh we this is a little
[57:38] bit historic but I I always amazed what
[57:41] God will do. You know in Chile many
[57:43] years ago a young man had backslid and
[57:46] his parents and namely his mother would
[57:49] send him gifts and put a message book
[57:51] inside of that and he would take the
[57:53] message book and he would put it in the
[57:55] trash because he wasn't interested. He
[57:58] had been
[58:00] liberated. Hallelujah. Wow. Isn't it
[58:04] wonderful to be liberated? Yes, it is.
[58:06] Oh, it is the most glorious thing. So,
[58:08] you can see the
[58:10] euphoria under that anointing that he
[58:12] felt like, I've been
[58:15] liberated. I can do anything I
[58:18] want. Well, I'll tell you, the flesh has
[58:21] a lot of wants. That's right. And when
[58:23] it's anointed with a spirit, it will
[58:25] want to do things that we will look
[58:27] back. I know many of us will be able to
[58:28] say amen to this. We'll look back and
[58:30] say, "Why did I ever want?" because that
[58:34] anointing and this young man would throw
[58:36] these message books in the trash. And in
[58:39] Chile, you have to understand that uh uh
[58:42] they don't have individual trash cans
[58:44] out on the street. They'll have a pole
[58:46] to keep the dogs out of it and these
[58:49] kind of half barrel type things and you
[58:52] go out and you put your trash there and
[58:55] uh they come and collect it out of that.
[58:57] And and here was a neighbor lady. She's
[58:59] there and she goes out one day and and
[59:01] she sees this nice crisp white booklet
[59:04] and and uh she's like, "I wonder what
[59:07] that is." It's in Spanish. And and she
[59:09] pulls it out and and she it's like,
[59:12] "Wow, this is interesting." And there's
[59:15] another one. And she takes those. And
[59:17] from that time on, she always looked in
[59:19] the trash to see if there was something
[59:21] in there. And as she's reading this, my
[59:24] brother and sister, she is starting to
[59:26] believe. Amen. And so one day she just
[59:29] fully is like, "This is the truth." And
[59:33] she catches this young man at his house
[59:35] there and she's holding a big handful of
[59:37] message books and she is uh if you knew
[59:41] this sister, I want to be polite. Uh
[59:43] she's not easily deterred. Let's put it
[59:45] that way. We want we want to be very
[59:47] kind to the sister. Not easily deterred.
[59:50] and she goes with a handful of message
[59:52] books and puts them in this young man's
[59:54] face and says, "How could you dare throw
[59:57] this precious stuff away? I want to know
[1:00:01] where does this come from?" And and he
[1:00:04] tells her, "Well, my mom sends it to me
[1:00:06] and I don't believe it." And she looks
[1:00:07] at him and says, "There's something
[1:00:10] wrong with you if you can't believe
[1:00:12] this." And so it goes on. She contacts
[1:00:16] the church. She actually moves and
[1:00:19] becomes part of the church there. And
[1:00:21] you think, wow, the Lord allowed the
[1:00:24] word of the hour to be thrown in the
[1:00:27] trash so that she could find it. But you
[1:00:29] see, it didn't stop right there. That
[1:00:32] sister's voice echoed in that young
[1:00:34] man's ears of how could I do this? And
[1:00:39] he gives his heart back to the Lord. And
[1:00:41] and today both, you know, families uh
[1:00:44] are serving the Lord. You see, even if
[1:00:46] the seed must go in the trash,
[1:00:52] it will find who it's supposed to go to.
[1:00:55] So, don't ever feel forsaken. Don't feel
[1:00:58] to give up because you see, we're not in
[1:01:00] control of where the seed is at. Amen.
[1:01:03] But we are in control of atmosphere that
[1:01:06] we leave around the seed. Amen. Uh, you
[1:01:09] know, she was very bold and blunt, but
[1:01:11] she wasn't family, right? So, it was a
[1:01:14] little hard for him to be really
[1:01:16] offended because this lady actually
[1:01:18] babysat uh his children on occasion when
[1:01:22] they needed it. So, you know, he didn't
[1:01:24] get upset with her, but she was so blunt
[1:01:26] that, you know, in our case, we have to
[1:01:28] be careful because Satan, we'll touch on
[1:01:30] this in a little bit, Satan loves to use
[1:01:32] offense. An offense is a very very
[1:01:36] difficult thing because once offended,
[1:01:38] it is very hard to win a soul back from
[1:01:42] that because Satan will anoint that
[1:01:44] offense over and over and over. But the
[1:01:46] gospel is going to the ends of the
[1:01:48] earth. Amen. a brother who once worked
[1:01:51] for an airline that flew uh uh freight
[1:01:54] into the back country and and uh you
[1:01:56] know he just started inserting a message
[1:01:59] book in all of this freight that they're
[1:02:02] shipping or flying out there and he said
[1:02:04] I don't know where those books went. I
[1:02:06] don't believe if God let them throw it
[1:02:08] in the trash then so be it. But one soul
[1:02:11] we know for certain picked that book up
[1:02:14] and read it and believed. So we're
[1:02:16] looking to see the gospel going to the
[1:02:18] ends of the earth. Amen. Brothers that
[1:02:21] some of you would know. Amen. Have been
[1:02:23] going to places like Nepal and going up
[1:02:25] into the country where where all of the
[1:02:28] different uh like Buddhists and all of
[1:02:30] this stuff reigns and the message is
[1:02:32] growing. And it's not just that
[1:02:34] somebody's being there preaching
[1:02:36] convinced, but one believer believing
[1:02:38] the word. And then the wife sees this
[1:02:41] difference. Her husband's no longer a
[1:02:43] drunk and he no longer wants to beat her
[1:02:45] up when he's angry. He no longer is
[1:02:48] mistreating the children. And the wife
[1:02:50] says, "Something's happened to him.
[1:02:52] Whatever it is, I need it." And then the
[1:02:54] children say, "Something's happened to
[1:02:55] mom and dad. Whatever it is, I need it."
[1:02:58] And the neighbor says, "Something's
[1:02:59] happened to my neighbor. Whatever it is,
[1:03:02] I need it." Amen. And it's going to the
[1:03:04] ends of the earth. Amen. And these are
[1:03:07] signs of the times without it going.
[1:03:10] Amen.
[1:03:12] Mark 16:15, you all know it. Amen. He
[1:03:14] said unto them, "Go ye into all the
[1:03:16] world and preach the gospel to every
[1:03:19] creature." And that is happening. That
[1:03:21] is taking place, my brother and sister.
[1:03:24] As it is, there are groups in Africa.
[1:03:26] Amen. Out in in different countries
[1:03:29] there, different places uh in Zimbabwe
[1:03:32] and and it's still spreading in Malawi.
[1:03:34] Although you can't hardly go to a a
[1:03:36] village of any size in Malawi now, but
[1:03:39] what they know about this message. Amen.
[1:03:42] But it's still gleaning out from those
[1:03:45] places and there's still a commitment.
[1:03:47] Now, I'm not trying to compare us to
[1:03:49] them, so don't misunderstand me. But my
[1:03:51] brother and sister, they have such
[1:03:53] commitment that when they want to go to
[1:03:55] church on Sunday, they start walking on
[1:03:58] Saturday. They will and they will show
[1:04:00] up in time for church on Sunday. And
[1:04:03] when church is over, they don't want to
[1:04:05] leave. So they linger as long as they
[1:04:07] can. They don't make it home till
[1:04:09] sometime in Monday afternoon or late.
[1:04:12] Amen. And you see that's something
[1:04:14] burning in us. Now we're not putting
[1:04:17] ourselves there. They have their
[1:04:18] challenge. We live here in this world of
[1:04:22] convenience. We have our challenge. But
[1:04:26] God, help us to have that kind of zeal
[1:04:28] for the gospel. to see the gospel shared
[1:04:31] and spread and see it be life-changing.
[1:04:34] You know, if you want to ever catch
[1:04:36] someone's attention, take whatever you
[1:04:39] have and add enthusiasm to it and they
[1:04:42] will want to know what means so much to
[1:04:46] you. Amen. Not about you're going to
[1:04:49] hell if you don't believe this, but
[1:04:51] everyone is searching. Every individual
[1:04:54] is searching for something that will
[1:04:57] change their life. Amen. If you would
[1:05:00] think money is the answer, then there
[1:05:02] are certain rich men that are very
[1:05:05] miserable and very very and money should
[1:05:09] fix that for them. And there are people
[1:05:11] with great possession, which in a sense
[1:05:14] might be money, but they they own a
[1:05:16] great possession like the rich young
[1:05:18] ruler. They should be
[1:05:20] happy, but they're not. You see, it's
[1:05:24] the
[1:05:25] gospel. Amen. Not the gospel according
[1:05:28] to modern day. Amen. But the real
[1:05:31] gospel. Now in works is faith expressed.
[1:05:34] Brother Brennham says this. He said, "Oh
[1:05:38] my same works that was promised in his
[1:05:41] day vindicated him to be that Messiah."
[1:05:44] Don't you believe that? And of course we
[1:05:46] do. Jesus was absolutely vindicated.
[1:05:50] Well now, brother, it the works of Luke
[1:05:52] the 17th chapter 30th verse. the promise
[1:05:55] of Jesus Christ just before his coming
[1:05:57] that the world would turn back to
[1:06:02] Sodom. Think we're headed
[1:06:06] there? The world's turning back to
[1:06:10] Sodom. I tell you, my brother and
[1:06:12] sister, you don't have to look very
[1:06:15] far to see the indecent and the immoral
[1:06:19] on absolute public display. That's
[1:06:22] right. Amen.
[1:06:25] Not that many years
[1:06:28] ago, what they consider normal music,
[1:06:31] now the singer would have been arrested
[1:06:36] and charged with indecency. That's
[1:06:38] exactly right. Now they're paid millions
[1:06:42] to promote it. Yes, sir. So, we are
[1:06:44] headed back. I don't think we even have
[1:06:47] a clue what Sodom looked
[1:06:49] like. We have an idea. Now, if you have
[1:06:52] a different idea, that's fine. But I'll
[1:06:53] just tell you what my idea used to be.
[1:06:56] Here's Sodom. Dusty streets, people
[1:06:59] around sitting in the shade in the heat
[1:07:01] of the day, and you know, they're just
[1:07:03] doing their thing, but they didn't
[1:07:05] really care about God. They didn't care
[1:07:07] about anything. Now, the word says it
[1:07:09] will be like
[1:07:12] Sodom. Can I just part the cloud and you
[1:07:15] step into
[1:07:17] Sodom? Here would be these indecent,
[1:07:19] immoral people cursing God walking down
[1:07:23] the
[1:07:25] streets
[1:07:26] suggesting every indecent thing that can
[1:07:30] be suggested. Yeah. Well, they said it
[1:07:34] would be like Sodom. And that's what
[1:07:36] they're doing today.
[1:07:39] Yeah. My brothers and sisters, the
[1:07:42] examples are out there. I don't want to
[1:07:43] go. This is the house of God. We don't
[1:07:45] want to go there.
[1:07:47] But as it was in the days of Sodom,
[1:07:50] Sodom was a really really wicked,
[1:07:53] indecent, morally bankrupt
[1:07:57] place. Especially I I I don't want to
[1:08:00] focus on this, but especially when you
[1:08:02] look at the fact that
[1:08:04] Lot offered his daughters up. Yeah,
[1:08:07] that's right. Just said, "Take them."
[1:08:09] Yeah, that's right. What kind of man
[1:08:11] Yeah.
[1:08:12] would offer his daughters
[1:08:15] up. A man that knew that these were men
[1:08:18] of
[1:08:18] God and was trying to do his best to
[1:08:21] protect men of God in a morally bankrupt
[1:08:26] world.
[1:08:28] I preached that in a little village in
[1:08:30] the south of Patagonia,
[1:08:33] Argentina. The man and the woman that
[1:08:35] were there owned the the fishing lodge.
[1:08:40] It struck the man so hard. You want to
[1:08:42] see the word coming to pass, my brother
[1:08:44] and sister? It struck the man so hard
[1:08:46] when I used that as a type that a man
[1:08:48] would offer his daughters up to be
[1:08:50] lusted after and pawed and treated,
[1:08:53] mistreated and whatever. Struck the man
[1:08:56] so hard. He said, "I believe what you
[1:08:58] preached and I want to get baptized. I
[1:09:00] want to do this." And then there was an
[1:09:02] argument at the end of service broke out
[1:09:04] just outside of the door. And uh I asked
[1:09:07] a brother, "What is this argument
[1:09:08] about?" And I'm not speaking down uh as
[1:09:11] it were on the man's wife. But the
[1:09:13] argument was about that if you accept
[1:09:16] this and get baptized in the name of
[1:09:18] Jesus Christ, we will lose every bit of
[1:09:21] prestige and influence and position that
[1:09:24] we have in this town. We will lose it
[1:09:27] all if you go there. I demand that you
[1:09:31] back up from getting baptized
[1:09:34] tomorrow. And then I talked to him again
[1:09:36] for a few minutes and he says, "I'll see
[1:09:38] you tomorrow, but my brother and sister,
[1:09:40] we didn't see him
[1:09:42] tomorrow." And you'll see how it is that
[1:09:44] come to a place that what they have and
[1:09:47] their position. Did the prophet not talk
[1:09:49] about this that they cannot give that up
[1:09:53] for the
[1:09:55] gospel? So, we're seeing the timeline of
[1:09:57] the gospel. These things are being
[1:09:59] fulfilled. It's coming to pass. It's
[1:10:01] right before us that people are seeing
[1:10:03] just like brother Brown talks about the
[1:10:05] rabbi. He says, "I would be kicked out.
[1:10:07] I would lose everything if I, you know,
[1:10:10] agree with this." And and my brother and
[1:10:12] sister, when it comes to that place,
[1:10:14] we're seeing these things coming to pass
[1:10:16] in a very graduated degree. Amen. So,
[1:10:20] it's there. Amen. Now, it would turn
[1:10:23] back to Sodom and the messengers would
[1:10:25] go out and the things would be done just
[1:10:27] exactly. If that isn't taking place,
[1:10:29] then don't believe me that I've told you
[1:10:31] the truth. But if it is taking place,
[1:10:34] then believe that it's him. In the day
[1:10:37] the son of man will be revealed. Amen.
[1:10:41] And the son of man will be revealed in a
[1:10:43] body of flesh. Look at this. Take the
[1:10:46] comma, my brother and sister. Put it in
[1:10:48] there for the space. In a body of flesh,
[1:10:51] you people. Yes, sir. He's not talking
[1:10:54] about himself as it were or someone
[1:10:56] else. He's talking about you people
[1:10:59] revealed in a body of flesh. You people,
[1:11:02] the church, just exactly like it was in
[1:11:05] the days of Sodom. A called out group
[1:11:08] away from all of them setting out
[1:11:10] believing the promise of God. Glory.
[1:11:14] Amen. And I punctuate that with a glory.
[1:11:16] Amen. That this is happening. Amen. And
[1:11:20] then the works that the Holy Spirit is
[1:11:22] doing today by these visions never
[1:11:24] failing, promises never failing, all the
[1:11:26] apostolic signs promised in the Bible,
[1:11:28] Malachi 4 and old, Revelation 10:7, all
[1:11:32] of that being fulfilled and proved by
[1:11:34] scientific every other way. Now, my
[1:11:37] brother and sister, I'm going to just
[1:11:38] speak a little bit blunt this morning. I
[1:11:40] hope you don't mind. I don't mean to
[1:11:41] introduce the negative, but we got
[1:11:43] people traveling through this land,
[1:11:45] through Europe, through Africa that are
[1:11:47] they're setting out to prove that what
[1:11:49] you believe it is false. But you notice
[1:11:53] they never have anything true to offer.
[1:11:57] That's right. All they're doing is
[1:11:59] trying to draw away with no promise
[1:12:03] beyond it. Just quit believing. Well,
[1:12:07] I'll tell you, my brother and sister,
[1:12:08] I'll be this blunt. That's nothing but a
[1:12:11] devil in disguise. Amen. And let me
[1:12:14] paraphrase this or bring this or tie it
[1:12:16] together that when it's Christ in you,
[1:12:19] Amen. When God is in you, it is God in
[1:12:22] disguise in you. Amen. He's not standing
[1:12:26] there saying, "I'm God." But yet the
[1:12:28] word says, "Are we not little gods?"
[1:12:31] Amen. So we have to find our correct
[1:12:33] understanding of where we're standing in
[1:12:36] the hour. Because if you want to not
[1:12:39] believe, that's your right. That's your
[1:12:41] privilege. You can do that. But I want
[1:12:43] to know where you're going. What are you
[1:12:45] reaching out to take a hold of? I'll
[1:12:48] tell you, there was a ship. It carried
[1:12:49] the atomic bomb in World War II. Amen.
[1:12:52] The Indianapolis. And they were there.
[1:12:55] And after it delivered the uh the bomb,
[1:12:58] it's traveling back across the ocean, is
[1:13:00] hit with a torpedo, and it sinks. And my
[1:13:03] brother and sister, they gave all of
[1:13:05] these sailors at that time a new latest
[1:13:08] version of a life preserver. The latest
[1:13:12] version of the message, this will save
[1:13:15] you. But what they didn't know is
[1:13:17] extended time in saltwater. It lost its
[1:13:21] buoyancy. And many people were grasping
[1:13:24] for anything to hold on to because they
[1:13:27] were slowly sinking. And this is the
[1:13:29] spirit of Leodysia in the hour we live
[1:13:32] in. People are leaving this gospel. I'm
[1:13:35] not talking about just putting it at the
[1:13:36] message, but the true word of God.
[1:13:38] They're leaving the gospel and they've
[1:13:40] went out and accepted a new version of
[1:13:43] something that's going to save them. But
[1:13:45] Leodysia has waterlogged their savior,
[1:13:48] their their their security, and they're
[1:13:51] slowly sinking. And if you don't think
[1:13:53] so, just do your research and you'll see
[1:13:56] it's happening everywhere around us that
[1:13:58] their security is becoming political and
[1:14:01] it's becoming traditioned and it's
[1:14:03] becoming all kinds of things. And every
[1:14:06] bit of that you see the moral decay.
[1:14:09] You're seeing the gospel decaying before
[1:14:11] our eyes because they accepted something
[1:14:14] that was going to save them. It was a
[1:14:16] lot easier, a lot better that those
[1:14:18] K-pop uh life preservers were so much
[1:14:21] lighter, so much more comfortable than
[1:14:24] the old ones. And and it was there in
[1:14:27] saltwater, they become water logged and
[1:14:29] they drowned. And those people in their
[1:14:31] drowning would grasp for anything. In
[1:14:34] fact, let me tell you, my brother and
[1:14:36] sister that they would grasp a halt of
[1:14:39] another fellow sailor and shove him
[1:14:41] under trying to get up. That's it. And
[1:14:44] you look at the spirit of the day we
[1:14:45] live in. Do people just say, "You know
[1:14:47] what? I don't believe the message
[1:14:49] anymore. I'm going to go do my thing."
[1:14:51] No. They're grabbing someone else,
[1:14:52] trying to shove them under while they go
[1:14:55] under. Amen. You recognize that is
[1:14:57] Satan. Amen. In disguise.
[1:15:05] Hallelujah. And haven't I told you the
[1:15:07] truth? These things uh these things
[1:15:09] would not happen. But if I have told you
[1:15:11] the truth, they bear record that I've
[1:15:13] told you the truth. He's still the same
[1:15:15] yesterday, today, and forever. And the
[1:15:17] manifestation of his spirit is catching
[1:15:20] away a bride. Amen. The vindication of
[1:15:23] this word is producing a bride. Not a
[1:15:28] bigger church, not a not a group, not an
[1:15:30] organization, a bride. Amen. And I tell
[1:15:34] you what, nobody would want to get
[1:15:36] married. Amen. No young lady would want
[1:15:39] to get married. and and uh you know be
[1:15:41] standing in in the front of the church
[1:15:43] with her you know 2 4 6 8 10 whatever
[1:15:47] seems like this day and age the more the
[1:15:49] marrier but anyway you know they
[1:15:51] wouldn't want to be standing there a and
[1:15:54] you know have one of the bridesmaids say
[1:15:57] look um you know out loud got to make it
[1:15:59] public uh if you don't want to marry him
[1:16:01] I will
[1:16:04] it's happened before it's on
[1:16:07] recording you know and they're like what
[1:16:09] are talking about. She's like, "I've
[1:16:11] always had a crush on him."
[1:16:13] Well, I'm telling you, there's a lot of
[1:16:15] difference between having a crush.
[1:16:16] That's right. And being in love. That's
[1:16:18] right. And any man that has any sense
[1:16:20] about him is not going to marry someone
[1:16:22] because of a crush. He's going to marry
[1:16:24] them because he loves. Because the crush
[1:16:26] will run out at 6:00 a.m. breakfast.
[1:16:29] Amen. And the crush will run out at
[1:16:32] dirty, greasy clothes. That's right.
[1:16:33] Every day. Yeah. You know, but love
[1:16:37] endures. That's exactly. Amen. And this
[1:16:39] bride that this word is vindicated to
[1:16:42] bring forth in this day, my brother and
[1:16:44] sister, is a bride that in good and bad,
[1:16:47] in the heart, all the marriage vows for
[1:16:50] richer, for poor, for sickness, for
[1:16:52] health, it won't matter to her. She's in
[1:16:54] love and she has spoken the vows and
[1:16:57] received it in her heart. And the word
[1:16:59] is producing that bride.
[1:17:02] Hallelujah. Amen. His spirit is catching
[1:17:05] away a bride. Let that faith, let that
[1:17:08] faith, revelation. Amen. I love commas
[1:17:12] put in there. The space of time, it's
[1:17:13] good, my brother and sister. Amen. Jesus
[1:17:16] still the same yesterday, today, and
[1:17:18] forever. And the manifestation of his
[1:17:20] spirit, not the spirit of the preacher,
[1:17:22] not the spirit of the church, not the
[1:17:24] spirit of the age of of the country or
[1:17:27] whatever, but the Holy Spirit, his
[1:17:29] spirit is catching away a bride. Let
[1:17:32] that faith
[1:17:34] revelation Right. Absolutely. Fall into
[1:17:38] your heart. Yes, sir. This is the hour.
[1:17:40] That's right. That's right. Amen. There
[1:17:43] is a separation of the wise and the
[1:17:46] foolish right there. One said this
[1:17:48] message is true, but it never made it in
[1:17:51] their heart to say, "This is the hour.
[1:17:54] This is the hour I must be prepared to
[1:17:57] meet. Behold, my bridegroom cometh."
[1:18:00] Amen. And I'm going to go out to meet
[1:18:02] him. I know I bring it up a lot, but I
[1:18:04] just love the the the the parallel of
[1:18:07] it. Amen. That little story about the
[1:18:09] meat packer's son and the little girl on
[1:18:11] the ranch. My brother and sister, if she
[1:18:14] had just accepted that he will come back
[1:18:19] someday, that carriage would have drove
[1:18:21] up there and she would not have been
[1:18:23] prepared. But something registered in
[1:18:26] her heart and she says, "You know what?
[1:18:29] He said he'd be back in a year." Amen.
[1:18:31] and it's coming. And when that hour
[1:18:34] comes, I will be ready. You won't find
[1:18:37] me in there frantically sewing my
[1:18:39] wedding dress. It won't find me in there
[1:18:41] frantically trying to pack my suitcase.
[1:18:43] But the hour come, Amen. She didn't know
[1:18:46] exactly the day, but the hour come. And
[1:18:48] when the carriage came, she walked out
[1:18:51] to meet it. Oh Lord, help us. I want to
[1:18:53] be in that position when he comes. Amen.
[1:18:56] Just to be able to walk out and meet
[1:18:57] him. Amen. to recognize by revelation
[1:19:00] this is the hour. Now the prophet of God
[1:19:03] speaks about 3 minutes till midnight and
[1:19:06] um that was a lot of years ago. I was
[1:19:09] going to look up that time and and um uh
[1:19:11] the last time that brother Brandham
[1:19:13] mentions that and I forgot to so forgive
[1:19:15] me but uh he he's preaching on 3 minutes
[1:19:18] till midnight and he's talking about how
[1:19:21] that a countdown is taking place and uh
[1:19:24] in that if it was 3 minutes till
[1:19:27] midnight then my brother and sister
[1:19:28] where are we today?
[1:19:30] We we time has just ticked away. Amen.
[1:19:34] The countdown's taking place now. We're
[1:19:37] in a season right now that the bride's
[1:19:40] been given by the grace of God a time of
[1:19:44] preparation. And I say, Lord, this this
[1:19:47] is our time. Let's not waste our time.
[1:19:50] Amen. You know, anyone who's ever been
[1:19:52] an employer, anyone who's ever had
[1:19:55] employees, you know, when times are
[1:19:57] really, really good, you know, when the
[1:19:59] money is flowing and and all the bills
[1:20:01] are paid and you look over and your
[1:20:03] employees are leaning against something
[1:20:06] and they're chatting and laughing, it
[1:20:08] doesn't bother you. But soon as the time
[1:20:10] gets tight, when things are are a
[1:20:13] struggle and you look over and and you
[1:20:15] see guys, you know, they're and doing
[1:20:17] exactly the same thing they did many
[1:20:20] other times, but now it really starts to
[1:20:23] bother you because they're wasting. You
[1:20:25] don't say they're wasting their time.
[1:20:27] No, you say they're wasting my time.
[1:20:30] That's right. Amen. Now, I want to know,
[1:20:33] and I'd be guilty of this. I'll just be
[1:20:34] honest, so I don't think I'm picking on
[1:20:36] you guys. I I I I'm glad of grace and
[1:20:40] mercy because I don't know how much time
[1:20:42] I've wasted the Lord's time, right? I've
[1:20:46] wasted a lot of it.
[1:20:49] And we we have to come because you see
[1:20:53] the clock is ticking down. We're coming
[1:20:55] to a place we're going to hear one of
[1:20:58] these days, "Behold, the bridegroom
[1:21:01] cometh. Go ye out to meet him." Well,
[1:21:04] you know what? I don't want to be in the
[1:21:06] back 40 as it were. Forgive my farm
[1:21:09] language there. I don't want to be in
[1:21:11] the back bedroom. I don't want to be in
[1:21:13] the basement when he
[1:21:15] comes. I want to be right there ready to
[1:21:19] go out to meet him because you see the
[1:21:22] clock is ticking down. I think we we all
[1:21:24] would have to acknowledge or agree with
[1:21:26] that. And uh so the bride in her time of
[1:21:30] preparation, she's not just still
[1:21:33] shopping for cloth. She's turning that
[1:21:35] cloth into a marriage gown. Amen. And so
[1:21:40] her countdown is taking place. Now look
[1:21:42] at the difference, my brother and
[1:21:43] sister. We can be motivated by the word
[1:21:46] of God. In other words, reading the word
[1:21:48] and and that really motivates us. Oh, I
[1:21:50] got to do something. But could we be
[1:21:53] honest with ourselves that we are such
[1:21:55] creatures of
[1:21:57] habit? How long does it take us to go
[1:22:00] right back to where we were?
[1:22:04] I
[1:22:05] mean, I'll speak to the
[1:22:08] brothers. Brothers, when you go on a
[1:22:13] diet, how long does it take us to go
[1:22:16] back? You know, years ago when I was
[1:22:18] driving
[1:22:19] truck, Jerry would tell me, "You know,
[1:22:22] you're gaining weight." I'd tell her,
[1:22:23] "You need to get me some bigger pants."
[1:22:25] And she's like, "You just need to get a
[1:22:26] smaller body." Uh, and
[1:22:29] uh, you know, I would leave home with a
[1:22:33] vow that I was going to eat salads on
[1:22:35] this trip. Can any of you guess how long
[1:22:38] that
[1:22:40] lasted? One
[1:22:42] dinner.
[1:22:43] Yeah. First truck stop you'd park at the
[1:22:46] night, you'd walk in a restaurant and
[1:22:48] there on the wall was a sign, all you
[1:22:52] can eat steak and
[1:22:54] shrimp. Well, it's a little bit spendy,
[1:22:56] but
[1:22:58] Man, can I demolish steak taken shrimp.
[1:23:01] It said nothing about the salad bar. I
[1:23:04] give not one thought to the salad bar. I
[1:23:06] went right back to where I was before.
[1:23:10] Lord, help us. Amen. Lord, give us a
[1:23:14] permanent moving from our old flesh
[1:23:19] to come to a place that we can honestly
[1:23:23] say, I am ready for the coming of the
[1:23:26] Lord. Amen.
[1:23:28] Amen. Would you agree with me?
[1:23:31] Amen. See, wherever you go, whatever you
[1:23:35] do, God was back there. Those Hebrews,
[1:23:37] Let me catch where I'm at. Okay, I'm
[1:23:40] sorry. Jumped down there a little too
[1:23:42] quick. So, the bride's in her
[1:23:44] preparation, her countdown. It's not a
[1:23:48] Godimposed countdown.
[1:23:51] She believes this by revelation so much
[1:23:55] that she's going to make herself ready.
[1:23:58] Right? Scriptural words. She's going to
[1:24:01] make herself ready. That's not some
[1:24:05] preacher poking with a stick over the
[1:24:07] pulpit like I'm poking you this morning.
[1:24:10] No, you're going to say, "Lord, I'm
[1:24:12] going to be ready." I mean, could you
[1:24:14] lift a hand in a heart and say this
[1:24:16] morning, "Lord, I'm going to be ready. I
[1:24:18] I am not going to linger over here in
[1:24:20] the shadows. I am going to be ready.
[1:24:24] Amen. Amen. Now, in the seven compound
[1:24:27] names of Jehovah,
[1:24:29] uh, brother Brandham says this, just
[1:24:30] think of that that everything in the Old
[1:24:33] Testament pointed straight to Calvary.
[1:24:35] All the plans of redemption, all the
[1:24:37] names, all the symbols, all the worship,
[1:24:39] all of the tabernacle, all of the wood,
[1:24:42] all of everything in the tabernacle,
[1:24:44] everything spoke of Christ. Wherever you
[1:24:47] go, whatever you do, God was back there
[1:24:51] in those Hebrew prophets and so forth,
[1:24:53] speaking and speaking to the time that
[1:24:56] per that speaking to that time of
[1:25:00] perfection that Jesus would come to
[1:25:03] perfect the believer. Amen. Just think
[1:25:06] of what that means, friends. You see,
[1:25:09] we're looking at a time, the prophet of
[1:25:11] God lays this out very clearly, my
[1:25:14] brother and sister, that there was a
[1:25:15] time, and he's talking about the ages in
[1:25:18] the church age book. He's talking about
[1:25:19] the ages. And he says there's never been
[1:25:22] an age like this age. Now, everything
[1:25:26] that culminated through those ages is
[1:25:28] present here, but there's never been a
[1:25:31] revealing or an opening of the
[1:25:35] mysteries. Mysteries, Amen. It's really
[1:25:37] singular, but but there's many compound
[1:25:40] components in that. Amen. So, there's
[1:25:42] never been an opening of the mystery of
[1:25:45] Jesus Christ like today. Amen. So, what
[1:25:48] are we looking at? Amen. Bear with me if
[1:25:50] you would on the interpretation of this.
[1:25:53] Amen. Is speaking of the time when Jesus
[1:25:55] would come to perfect the believer. That
[1:25:58] is this time. Just think of what that
[1:26:01] means, friends. Amen. We're right here
[1:26:04] in this time, right now in the
[1:26:06] perfecting of the believer. Amen. They
[1:26:09] had the word for their age, but
[1:26:11] remember, brother Brandham takes it back
[1:26:12] through that and says now the message
[1:26:15] for their time, Amen, was for their
[1:26:17] time. In other words, you know, they
[1:26:19] can't go back and grab Noah's message,
[1:26:21] amen, they can't go back and grab
[1:26:24] Moses's message. And let me just put it
[1:26:26] really blunt because of what the prophet
[1:26:28] has showed us very clearly in the word.
[1:26:31] It will not do for you today to go back
[1:26:34] and simply grab brother Brham's message.
[1:26:38] There is revelation. There is the
[1:26:40] opening of the word. The personal
[1:26:43] experience that you have with Jesus
[1:26:46] Christ. Amen. You can't go back as a
[1:26:49] Pentecostal, as a Baptist, as a
[1:26:52] Nazarene. You can't go back to that
[1:26:54] because the word has moved on. The bride
[1:26:57] is coming into perfection by the word of
[1:27:00] God. Amen. We're not looking back to see
[1:27:02] what all of these did and how they did
[1:27:04] it. But we're looking to the word that
[1:27:06] has come in this hour. And that word is
[1:27:09] pulling you and I into perfection. Now,
[1:27:12] what we've got to do to be pulled into
[1:27:14] perfection is we've got to surrender.
[1:27:16] Amen. You can't say, "Well, you know, I
[1:27:18] I this if this would be if God would do
[1:27:21] something supernatural." Do you know in
[1:27:23] my younger years when I I wasn't serving
[1:27:25] God. Oh, I went to church. See, people
[1:27:28] get confused. I I shared a little my
[1:27:30] testimony in South Africa and people
[1:27:31] like, "Oh, you didn't go to church." No,
[1:27:33] I went to church every time I could.
[1:27:35] Yeah. And I wasn't saved. That's it. I
[1:27:37] didn't have the Holy Ghost. I didn't
[1:27:39] really believe. That's it. What's it
[1:27:42] show? We can be religious and lost.
[1:27:45] That's right. And so it's there, my
[1:27:47] brother and sister. You see, we go into
[1:27:49] this and you might be in the house of
[1:27:51] God, but if you can't receive it, that
[1:27:54] word, that's right. That's exactly
[1:27:56] right. You can't take that seed into
[1:27:58] you.
[1:28:01] That's it.
[1:28:04] What do we have?
[1:28:06] Amen.
[1:28:09] Always like that. South Africa, I had a
[1:28:11] brother bring it up. He said, "Brother
[1:28:12] Paul, you're I was just listening to the
[1:28:14] prophet and he was talking about this
[1:28:15] hybrid seed. It can't reproduce itself."
[1:28:18] And he says, "Do you have any problem in
[1:28:20] your fields? I mean, does does the the
[1:28:22] seed the kernels from that hybrid seed
[1:28:24] will it grow?" I absolutely it'll grow.
[1:28:26] Yeah, I bet you absolutely it'll grow.
[1:28:28] And it grows with vigor. Now, get this.
[1:28:31] This is where the people be like, "Well
[1:28:33] then, Brother Brown was wrong." No, no,
[1:28:35] no, no, no, no, no. The first generation
[1:28:39] that I planted come up big, tall,
[1:28:43] beautiful plant, big ear. Some of that
[1:28:45] seed gets knocked off, goes in the soil,
[1:28:48] comes
[1:28:49] up, beautiful plant, relatively big ear.
[1:28:53] Some of that seed goes in the ground,
[1:28:55] comes up, grows a normal
[1:28:58] plant and a reasonable
[1:29:00] ear. By about the fourth generation of
[1:29:03] that, it's reverted back to what it was
[1:29:08] before.
[1:29:10] And why'd they hybrid it? Because they
[1:29:12] wanted something bigger, more beautiful.
[1:29:15] And so it reverts back to not the
[1:29:18] gospel,
[1:29:20] but denomination spirit. That's right.
[1:29:22] As it was in the beginning. That's
[1:29:24] right. You realize that that you know
[1:29:27] the devil had Cain had a church. Sure
[1:29:30] did. They had an altar. They had
[1:29:32] services. Amen. It was all right there.
[1:29:34] It's right there. What was it though?
[1:29:36] That spirit. Amen. come got hybrid,
[1:29:39] produced a big, beautiful church that's
[1:29:42] headed right back where it came from.
[1:29:45] That's right.
[1:29:48] Let me move
[1:29:51] on. I better move on quickly. John 6:37
[1:29:56] to 40. Amen. All that the Father giveth
[1:30:00] me shall come. See, we get we get
[1:30:01] worried sometimes. Look, I'm I'm getting
[1:30:05] more vocal as time goes on. I've got a
[1:30:07] son that doesn't serve the Lord, but
[1:30:08] God's God's really working on him. Amen.
[1:30:11] But we get all concerned about our
[1:30:13] children and their misbehavior. Well, I
[1:30:15] don't mean to sound boastful. It's
[1:30:17] nothing to be boastful about, but there
[1:30:19] was a time that I would have been
[1:30:21] considered a poster child of the the
[1:30:23] prodal or weward son, right? Uh people
[1:30:26] told my my mom, you know, that yeah,
[1:30:29] your son left us because he wasn't of us
[1:30:31] and give no hope. And it caused my mom a
[1:30:34] lot of bitter tears. But my brother and
[1:30:36] sister, look at this word. Let's look at
[1:30:39] it very carefully. All that the father
[1:30:41] giveth me shall come to me, and him that
[1:30:44] cometh to me, I will in no wise cast
[1:30:47] out. Now, you just look at this. Satan's
[1:30:50] trying to deviate or bring this uh in
[1:30:53] such a way, but my brother and sister,
[1:30:55] the word is clicking down. And when the
[1:30:58] word said, Amen. Well, let me just
[1:31:00] preach on here. I will know my eyes cast
[1:31:02] out. For I come down from heaven, not to
[1:31:04] do my own will, but the will of him that
[1:31:05] sent me. And this is the Father's will
[1:31:08] which hath sent me, that of all which he
[1:31:11] hath given me, I should lose nothing.
[1:31:15] That ought to give us some hope right
[1:31:16] now. Amen. Maybe, maybe it doesn't. You
[1:31:19] don't need to have your tears dried.
[1:31:20] Amen. Maybe you don't need to have a
[1:31:22] little sorrow taken from you, but it
[1:31:24] should build a confidence in you that as
[1:31:26] the clock is ticking down, God's word
[1:31:29] says, "I will not lose a single one."
[1:31:34] Amen. Amen. Let us stand on that word
[1:31:37] and let us confess that and let us pray
[1:31:39] that and let us praise God for that.
[1:31:42] It's his promise. And if he can't keep
[1:31:44] that promise, then what other promises
[1:31:46] will he not keep? Amen. Amen. We stand
[1:31:49] on that word and say, "God said it. I
[1:31:51] believe it." Everyone that has a seed.
[1:31:54] Now, we're not in control of that seed.
[1:31:56] We're not in control of nothing. But I
[1:31:58] tell you what it comes, my brother and
[1:31:59] sister. I'd rather be found on that day
[1:32:01] believing.
[1:32:03] No matter what the circumstance is, let
[1:32:05] me be found on that day believing.
[1:32:08] Hallelujah.
[1:32:10] Amen. He giveth me. Should lose nothing,
[1:32:13] but should raise up again in the last
[1:32:15] day. Remember, let me just put this out.
[1:32:18] And I don't know why I feel led to do
[1:32:19] this, but you remember there was a
[1:32:21] family and a a young boy snuck out at
[1:32:24] night and got in an accident and died
[1:32:26] and they are troubled. Oh
[1:32:29] Lord, brother Brandham, our
[1:32:32] son, what is what happened? I mean, he
[1:32:35] was a good boy and he's went this other
[1:32:36] way and now he's died in this
[1:32:39] accident. And brother Brown says, "Let
[1:32:42] me pray about it." Yeah. And he comes
[1:32:44] back to them. Now see, it didn't restore
[1:32:47] their son. He's gone. Yeah. But brother
[1:32:49] Brandon comes back to them and said, "I
[1:32:51] was asking the Lord about your son."
[1:32:56] And all I saw was light.
[1:33:04] And some weward preacher would probably
[1:33:06] say, "Boy, the poor boy backslid and
[1:33:08] died and I guess he's in hell now." No.
[1:33:12] It took a prophet to go search it for
[1:33:15] him. That's right.
[1:33:18] And God shows him a pathway
[1:33:22] with
[1:33:24] light. Now, whose report you going to
[1:33:26] believe? That's right.
[1:33:30] You can stand on this and say, "Oh, all
[1:33:32] is lost. All is lost. Everything is a
[1:33:35] disaster." Or you can stand on the word
[1:33:38] and say, "You know
[1:33:42] what? All that's been given." Amen.
[1:33:44] That's it right there. Amen. That's it.
[1:33:48] Is the will of him that sent me that
[1:33:50] everyone which seeth the son and
[1:33:52] believeth on him may have everlasting
[1:33:54] life and I will raise him up in the last
[1:33:56] day. Now in the sermon uh greater than
[1:34:00] Solomon is here now. Uh I I like this uh
[1:34:04] this ties right by the song uh that
[1:34:07] brother Isaac led us in there uh uh
[1:34:10] touch me as it did because here we are
[1:34:13] and greater than Solomon is here now but
[1:34:15] you know there's something about it if
[1:34:17] God begins to put a hunger in a human
[1:34:19] heart there's just nothing going to
[1:34:22] stand in its way whether there is
[1:34:24] cooperation or not whether there is
[1:34:27] anything she has got to find that like I
[1:34:30] said about the little woman last being
[1:34:32] persistent and perseverant. See,
[1:34:34] something gets a hold of you and you get
[1:34:37] a hold of something. Now, my brother and
[1:34:39] sister, it's quite the thing, you know,
[1:34:41] to to to do this and and I don't want to
[1:34:44] speak out of turn here, but it's one
[1:34:46] thing, you know, to have a relationship
[1:34:48] where maybe the wife hugs the husband,
[1:34:50] but the husband never hugs the wife or
[1:34:52] vice versa. Amen. The the the taking
[1:34:55] hold, Amen. conveys something. So we can
[1:34:58] take a hulse of religion, but when God
[1:35:01] takes a hold of us, that's it. Amen.
[1:35:04] There's a difference. Amen. So you get a
[1:35:07] hold of something. It get a hold of you
[1:35:08] and you get a hold of something. Like
[1:35:10] Jacob, the son of God, Jacob, God's son,
[1:35:12] got a hold of something one night and it
[1:35:14] got a hold of him. Amen. And he never
[1:35:17] let it go until he achieved his purpose.
[1:35:20] Blessed of it. Amen. Now look at the
[1:35:22] two-way street. I want to just bring
[1:35:24] this out for a second. The two-way
[1:35:26] street. Jacob got a hold of the angel.
[1:35:29] Amen. He's holding on. Says, "I'm not
[1:35:30] going to let you go." But you realize
[1:35:32] while they're wrestling, the angel had a
[1:35:34] hold of Jacob. So, while the scripture
[1:35:37] shows us very clearly that Jacob was
[1:35:39] hanging on for a blessing, he knew he
[1:35:41] needed something, what we have to see is
[1:35:44] that that angel could have broke away
[1:35:47] from Jacob at any time he pleased. that
[1:35:51] Jacob I mean the angel actually had a
[1:35:55] hold of Jacob.
[1:35:58] See two ways to look at that. Amen. You
[1:36:02] can't tell me that a man in his flesh
[1:36:04] held on to an angel and the angel could
[1:36:06] not
[1:36:07] escape what it was. It was
[1:36:10] necessary to work out his salvation with
[1:36:14] fear and trembling.
[1:36:17] The angel had a hold of him while he had
[1:36:19] a hold of the angel. That's right. Amen.
[1:36:21] So, it wasn't him like a limp doll rag
[1:36:24] and the angel hanging on to him. He
[1:36:27] wanted what the angel had. That's right.
[1:36:30] And the angel had something he wanted
[1:36:33] Jacob to have. That's right. Amen. That
[1:36:37] make sense to you?
[1:36:39] Amen. Holds of something night. It got a
[1:36:42] hold of him and he never let it go until
[1:36:43] he achieved his purpose. Blessed of it.
[1:36:45] That that's the real thing. And when a
[1:36:47] man impersonates something, it never
[1:36:49] works out right. Yeah, that's it. My oh
[1:36:52] my. But if you can get a hold of that
[1:36:55] something and that something get a hold
[1:36:57] of you, it's going to happen. Amen.
[1:37:01] That's why, my brother and sister, there
[1:37:03] is no redeeming value in emotion. That's
[1:37:08] right.
[1:37:09] Right. We can get so emotional, sobb and
[1:37:13] cry and get up and walk out of the
[1:37:16] church or wherever in the same exact
[1:37:20] position we walked in. Something's got
[1:37:23] to get a hold of you. Amen. Now, look at
[1:37:26] this. I like
[1:37:29] this. Something get a hold of you. It's
[1:37:31] going to happen. If you come here
[1:37:33] tonight for healing, let the Holy Spirit
[1:37:36] get a hold of you and you get a hold of
[1:37:38] it. You're going to get what you ask
[1:37:39] for. There's no way of keeping you from
[1:37:42] it. You come believing that Jesus Christ
[1:37:45] saves and there is a saving power gets a
[1:37:48] hold of you and you get a hold to it,
[1:37:50] you're going to get saved. If you
[1:37:52] believe in the baptism of the Holy
[1:37:54] Spirit and the Holy Spirit gets a hold
[1:37:56] of you and he'll baptize you and you get
[1:37:58] a hold of him, you won't have to move
[1:38:01] from your seat. He will fill you with
[1:38:02] his presence right where you are. Amen.
[1:38:06] Just as he did. That's why we don't need
[1:38:08] that's why the prophet people say well
[1:38:10] brother Brandon was against altar call
[1:38:12] brother Brandon was against the
[1:38:13] tradition of the altar call of people
[1:38:16] coming up here and people pounding them
[1:38:18] on the back and telling them you can do
[1:38:20] it even to the point they'll sit there
[1:38:22] and flutter their finger over their
[1:38:23] lips. Speak it. Speak it. Speak it.
[1:38:25] Speak it. Speak it. Amen. My brother and
[1:38:27] sister, that's not God getting a hold of
[1:38:29] them. That's not the Holy Spirit again.
[1:38:31] That's a spirit of man trying to get
[1:38:34] them to get a hold of something. But
[1:38:36] that something is not God. Amen. And
[1:38:40] this is what's happened in our day. And
[1:38:42] I'll just be blunt. It's creeping into
[1:38:44] the message that we are seeing people
[1:38:47] promoting the idea that we got to speak
[1:38:50] in tonesues again. When the prophet of
[1:38:51] God said we are beyond those days.
[1:38:56] You want to speak in tonesues or God God
[1:38:58] leads you to speak in tonesues. You
[1:39:00] speak in tonesues. Don't hold it back.
[1:39:01] Just let it go. But to pursue it, my
[1:39:04] brother and sister, is you laying a hold
[1:39:06] of something, but it's not laying a hold
[1:39:08] of you. Amen. Amen. Hopefully, I didn't
[1:39:12] I didn't offend anybody with those
[1:39:13] words. Amen. Amen.
[1:39:18] You get a hold of him, you won't have to
[1:39:19] move from your seat. He will fill you
[1:39:21] with his presence right where you are.
[1:39:23] Just as he did while Peter yet spake
[1:39:24] these words, the Holy Ghost fell on them
[1:39:27] that heard it. And something got a hold.
[1:39:29] Something got a hold of that little
[1:39:31] Sireh Phohician woman we spoke of last
[1:39:34] night. And no matter how many hindrances
[1:39:36] she had, anybody got any hindrances in
[1:39:39] your life? Come on.
[1:39:41] Teenagers right on up to the oldest of
[1:39:44] us, there's hindrances that are out
[1:39:46] here. Amen. No matter how many hindrance
[1:39:48] she had, she was still going anyhow.
[1:39:51] Something got a hold of this little
[1:39:52] queen we're talking about tonight. Amen.
[1:39:55] Queen of the South, a pagan, a heathen.
[1:39:57] So was this little Syphenician, a Greek,
[1:39:59] a pagan, idol worshipper. Something got
[1:40:01] a hold of them and they got a hold of
[1:40:04] something. There's always difficult in
[1:40:07] the way. Satan throws everything in the
[1:40:10] way he can. That's it. That's Well, I
[1:40:13] can't believe they said that. I don't
[1:40:15] like that, brother. I don't like that
[1:40:17] preacher. I don't. Come on. That's
[1:40:20] right. Wake up. That's right. The
[1:40:22] devil's over here throwing all kinds of
[1:40:26] stuff out in the road in front of you,
[1:40:29] just hoping that you'll come to that one
[1:40:32] thing that you just can't get over.
[1:40:36] I tell you, there's nothing like
[1:40:37] preaching a service and have someone
[1:40:39] come talk to you and tell you, "I got
[1:40:42] delivered tonight." Praise God, brother.
[1:40:44] You got delivered tonight. No, I'm
[1:40:45] talking about something that I have held
[1:40:47] in my heart for 25 years. And for 25
[1:40:52] years I had anger in my heart and that
[1:40:55] and tonight it's gone. Amen. Amen. My
[1:40:58] brothers and sisters, imagine 25 years a
[1:41:01] man faithful in church, a faithful
[1:41:04] believer as it were of the message and
[1:41:06] the devil just keep chunking it out in
[1:41:08] the road in front of him and he can't
[1:41:10] get over it.
[1:41:14] So what did he do? stopped right there
[1:41:15] in the road and then that
[1:41:19] little almost invisible seed of
[1:41:23] bitterness started to grow. Yeah, that's
[1:41:26] it. But God won't lose the one because
[1:41:28] I'll tell you, there is not a mourner's
[1:41:30] bench or a critic's bench or a
[1:41:34] blasphemer's bench
[1:41:37] in heaven. That's right. Just ain't
[1:41:39] there. No. So, if you're his, the seed's
[1:41:42] in you, that's it. You will overcome it.
[1:41:45] That's exactly right. Amen. Amen.
[1:41:47] Hallelujah. That's right.
[1:41:53] Satan throws everything in the way he
[1:41:54] can when he sees a real move of God get
[1:41:57] started. He'll do it to you. Can I Can I
[1:42:00] point my finger at all of you this
[1:42:02] morning here? Just He'll do it to you.
[1:42:05] That's exactly right. He will put
[1:42:07] something there to keep you from moving
[1:42:11] forward. Have you ever noticed that when
[1:42:14] an airplane even a
[1:42:18] a basically the new modern fighter jets
[1:42:21] are like a missile with some wings. But
[1:42:24] you ever noticed that as long as a
[1:42:26] normal
[1:42:28] airplane, Brother David would know this
[1:42:30] very
[1:42:31] well, you can lock the
[1:42:34] brakes and run the throttle up enough.
[1:42:38] Some of these new modern kind of bush
[1:42:40] style planes, they'll literally parked
[1:42:42] right there, they will lift the tail.
[1:42:45] There's so much air
[1:42:48] moving, but if they don't let their foot
[1:42:50] off the brake, it's not going anywhere.
[1:42:53] That's right. That's right. It'll just
[1:42:56] sit there and roar. Won't do
[1:42:58] anything. Amen. How many of you, Most of
[1:43:02] you probably own automatics. How many of
[1:43:04] you drive with one
[1:43:08] foot? How many of you drive with two
[1:43:11] feet?
[1:43:14] Do you know the bad
[1:43:15] habit of driving with two feet in an
[1:43:18] automatic is that you can be stepping on
[1:43:21] the gas and the brake at the same time
[1:43:27] and you can do it subconsciously. I I
[1:43:29] hate to admit this because Sister
[1:43:31] Jerry's always telling me they didn't
[1:43:32] teach you right. Well, they taught me
[1:43:34] right. I just got into false
[1:43:38] doctrine. But I was so distracted the
[1:43:40] other day. I come up to a stop sign and
[1:43:43] the other car went and I took my foot
[1:43:47] off the brake and the car just jumped
[1:43:48] out in the intersection. It caught me
[1:43:50] off guard. I didn't even realize I was
[1:43:51] sitting there with my foot on the brake
[1:43:53] and my foot on the gas at the same time.
[1:43:55] Fortunately, it was Sister Jerry's car
[1:43:57] so I don't have to worry about it. But
[1:43:59] but you know, my brother and sister, it
[1:44:01] won't do you any good. Won't do you any
[1:44:04] good if you need to go and you got your
[1:44:05] foot on the brake. It ain't going to do
[1:44:06] any good. If you need to stop and you
[1:44:08] got your foot on the gas, it's not going
[1:44:10] to do you any good. See, God wants us to
[1:44:13] come and say, "Lord, you want me to go,
[1:44:15] I'm going to go. I'm not going to put
[1:44:17] any hindrance in my way before me."
[1:44:19] Amen. Why? Because we're coming down to
[1:44:21] the time that God's going to deliver.
[1:44:24] Going back to what Brother said earlier,
[1:44:26] a perfect church. She's not going to put
[1:44:29] on the brake when God says go. And she's
[1:44:32] not going to go when God says put your
[1:44:33] foot on the brake. Amen.
[1:44:40] Why don't we I I've got quite a bit more
[1:44:42] here. Why don't we just go ahead?
[1:44:45] Brother Alex, are you playing for us?
[1:44:48] Amen. Whoever it
[1:44:50] is.
[1:44:52] Um going back to the
[1:44:55] countdown.
[1:44:57] Um I um I just love that sermon. It's
[1:45:02] just been such uh such a blessing to me.
[1:45:06] In the countdown, Brother Bram says,
[1:45:08] "Lord Jesus, forgive us our our ways.
[1:45:11] Maybe we'll fail somewhere. Maybe we'll
[1:45:13] get the message just the way it should
[1:45:15] be. But father, I pray that where we
[1:45:18] have made a mistake, that the great Holy
[1:45:20] Spirit will take the
[1:45:22] words, wind them around, and fix them
[1:45:25] into the hearts the correct way that
[1:45:27] they might
[1:45:29] understand that's preparation time now.
[1:45:33] Amen. Let's not just follow a message,
[1:45:36] my brother and sister. This is
[1:45:38] preparation time before the going away
[1:45:41] of the church. Let us all live for that
[1:45:43] hour, Lord. Live today like it might be
[1:45:46] today. And if he's not here today, we'll
[1:45:49] be looking for him tomorrow. Keep our
[1:45:53] hearts clean. This is I forgot to
[1:45:56] mention this. I'm sorry. This is a
[1:45:58] prayer. This is a a prayer brother Brown
[1:46:01] prays in the
[1:46:02] service. Let us all live for that hour.
[1:46:06] Lord, live today like it might be today.
[1:46:08] If it's not here today, we'll be looking
[1:46:10] for him tomorrow. keep our hearts clean
[1:46:12] from sin and selfishness. Keep our
[1:46:15] hearts clean, our souls undefiled by the
[1:46:18] blood of Jesus Christ that we might walk
[1:46:20] with him and live with him forever. And
[1:46:24] I would say, Lord, let that be our
[1:46:25] prayer today here as a group of
[1:46:28] believers. Let us come and and if we
[1:46:30] fail the Lord just correct us, bring us
[1:46:33] to a place, but take the words, apply
[1:46:37] them in our lives that we would be
[1:46:39] prepared for that if we would just
[1:46:42] stand. Amen.
[1:46:45] Hallelujah. I want to draw out of works
[1:46:47] as faith expressed. I I spoke that
[1:46:50] earlier. Uh let that
[1:46:53] faith revelation fall into our your
[1:46:56] heart that this is the hour. Amen. This
[1:47:00] is a season not to get caught up in
[1:47:04] something else. Not to get distracted
[1:47:06] with everything else, but to stay
[1:47:10] focused because you see the countdown of
[1:47:12] the
[1:47:13] word will not
[1:47:16] stop because you're distracted.
[1:47:20] It will not stop because you are
[1:47:22] preoccupied. It will not stop because
[1:47:25] you're still trying to figure
[1:47:27] out who you like and who you don't like,
[1:47:32] what you like and what you don't like.
[1:47:35] The clock is
[1:47:38] ticking. Let us be
[1:47:41] ready. Amen. I pray the word finds its
[1:47:44] place to each one of you. Amen. I know a
[1:47:48] little straightforward this morning, but
[1:47:50] you know when the Lord lays these things
[1:47:52] on your heart, you just have to speak
[1:47:53] them. I don't know. I I try not You guys
[1:47:56] know this. I try to keep my nose pretty
[1:47:58] much out of your family. Sometimes I
[1:48:00] don't even know what my own family is
[1:48:01] doing because I try to keep my nose out
[1:48:04] because you see, I want to have the
[1:48:06] liberty to just preach what God lays on
[1:48:08] my heart without people thinking, "Oh,
[1:48:10] he knew that. That's why he preached it.
[1:48:12] He knew that." No, I'm sorry. Just like
[1:48:16] I'll put it this way. That's why I I'm
[1:48:18] removed completely from the tithe of
[1:48:21] this church. I don't know who pays tithe
[1:48:23] and who doesn't. I don't know who pays
[1:48:25] whether it's a dollar or $1,000. And the
[1:48:28] reason is is because if the Lord lays on
[1:48:29] my heart and I want to preach about
[1:48:31] tithe, I don't want to have one single
[1:48:33] hindrance. You see, when we come in that
[1:48:36] right correct position, you're not
[1:48:39] prejudiced of what you preach. You can
[1:48:42] just follow the leadership of the Holy
[1:48:44] Spirit. And I pray today, saints, as we
[1:48:47] see the
[1:48:49] countdown, let's be
[1:48:52] ready. Let's just take all these
[1:48:54] distractions that Satan throws in our
[1:48:57] life, let us be ready. Got something you
[1:49:00] need to set in
[1:49:02] order? Don't procrastinate. Go set it in
[1:49:05] order. Got something that's bothered
[1:49:07] you? Find a place. Get down, pray
[1:49:10] through, get that swept, clean this
[1:49:13] slate off. Lord, help us. That's right.
[1:49:16] Cuz you see, it's very plain and these
[1:49:18] words are very
[1:49:20] direct. But you see, what the word says
[1:49:22] will get us into heaven. But he says
[1:49:25] that the lust of the flesh and the pride
[1:49:27] of life and these things without going
[1:49:30] through the whole list, those things
[1:49:32] will keep us from and you know those
[1:49:34] creep into our life
[1:49:36] [Music]
[1:49:37] so subtle. That'll be the right one.
[1:49:40] They just creep in so
[1:49:44] much. So
[1:49:46] subtle. Don't condemn
[1:49:48] yourself. Get deliverance from yourself.
[1:49:51] Amen. Claim the word. Stand on the word
[1:49:54] and say, "Lord, cleanse my heart." Amen.
[1:49:59] Hallelujah.
[1:50:03] 10:42.
[1:50:06] Amen. Hallelujah.
[1:50:08] [Music]
[1:50:11] It is the
[1:50:13] evening
[1:50:16] time. It's later than you
[1:50:22] think. The bride is
[1:50:26] preparing
[1:50:27] now for her Lord to me.
[1:50:36] Oh, all things are
[1:50:38] ready
[1:50:39] [Music]
[1:50:41] now. The bridegroom I
[1:50:48] hear. He that hath an ear to hear. The
[1:50:54] evening time is here. Let's sing it
[1:50:58] again.
[1:51:01] Oh, it is the
[1:51:04] evening
[1:51:06] time. It's later than you
[1:51:13] think. The bride is
[1:51:16] preparing now. That's
[1:51:19] us. Her Lord to me.
[1:51:26] Oh, all things are ready
[1:51:30] [Music]
[1:51:31] now. A bridegroom I
[1:51:38] hear, and he that hath an ear to
[1:51:42] hear the evening
[1:51:46] time is here.
[1:51:50] Heavenly
[1:51:52] Father, Lord, truly as the prophet of
[1:51:54] God says, we just want to let the word
[1:51:57] find its correct place.
[1:52:01] Lord, we're not here to make anyone feel
[1:52:03] bad or feel like what we're trying to
[1:52:07] push them down, but Father, just what
[1:52:09] you've laid on our heart that we'd
[1:52:12] recognize that we can get so caught up
[1:52:14] in
[1:52:15] life, so caught up in the things of
[1:52:19] life that somehow, Father, we left you
[1:52:22] at the
[1:52:24] door. Lord, let us stop and take the
[1:52:27] time. And when you
[1:52:29] knock, let us be quick to
[1:52:32] open. Lord, when you speak, let us be
[1:52:35] quick to
[1:52:37] respond. And when you ask
[1:52:40] us,
[1:52:42] Father, let us say yes, Lord.
[1:52:46] Father, for the age we live in
[1:52:49] is Satan's
[1:52:52] Eden, but we are not of Satan's Eden.
[1:52:55] We're passing through
[1:52:57] it. Let us not stop. Amen. And try to
[1:53:01] build something here in Satan's Eden.
[1:53:05] Let us continually follow your word. And
[1:53:08] as your word leads us forth, Lord, we
[1:53:12] won't find our address.
[1:53:14] Route one,
[1:53:16] Sodom. But we will find ourselves there
[1:53:20] in the streets of glory, praising our
[1:53:23] Lord, our Savior, our King, our
[1:53:25] bridegroom. Lord, we'll find ourselves

[1:53:29] position worshiping before the throne on
[1:53:32] the Sea of
[1:53:33] Crystal. Lord, lifting our voices in
[1:53:37] praise. There'll be no weariness, no
[1:53:40] sorrow, no pain. There'll be no
[1:53:43] distraction in that day, Father, Lord,
[1:53:46] that we can worship you for
[1:53:48] eternity. Again and again and again
[1:53:51] singing praises to your name, Lord.
[1:53:55] That's what we should look for. Let that

[1:54:07] today to be ready when we hear that
[1:54:11] voice say,
[1:54:13] "Behold, the bridegroom cometh."
[1:54:16] Lord, I want to be able to change those
[1:54:18] words and say, "Behold, my bridegroom
[1:54:22] cometh." Lord, let us stand upon that.
[1:54:26] We ask this in the name of Jesus Christ.
[1:54:29] And may every need, Father, be presented
[1:54:31] to you from faithful, sincere hearts
[1:54:36] that our motives would be pure. And
[1:54:38] Lord, you said you would be quick to
[1:54:40] answer and faithful to answer. Now let
[1:54:43] us come faithfully and correctly to you.
[1:54:48] Hallelujah.
