[37:26] psalm 16 and 11 and
[37:30] while we read that i was listening to
[37:31] the token this morning in
[37:34] 64 and at the end of the of the sermon
[37:37] he was
[37:38] telling him he said now when you go
[37:39] through the prayer line he wasn't
[37:41] discerning he was just laying on of
[37:43] hands with the other brothers
[37:44] he says as you walk through this prayer
[37:48] line those that are in wheelchairs
[37:50] get up those that have crutches thrown
[37:53] down
[37:53] amen praise the lord amen i like that
[37:58] and guess what happened they got up and
[38:00] they threw them down amen
[38:02] so i say praise the lord amen because he
[38:05] brought a presence of victory and that's
[38:07] what's here tonight is a presence of
[38:09] victory
[38:10] this message when brother paul asked me
[38:12] god gave it to me
[38:13] uh whatever a month ago or whatever it
[38:15] is so i know that god's gonna do
[38:17] something amen
[38:18] so praise the lord he's already done it
[38:20] amen he's just gonna let us
[38:22] allow us to have revelation that he's
[38:24] already done it amen
[38:26] and so the message is it's already done
[38:29] praise the lord psalm 16 11 that would
[38:32] show me the path of life
[38:34] in thy presence is fullness of joy
[38:37] at thy right hand power and authority
[38:42] there are pleasures forevermore amen
[38:45] lord jesus we thank you for the victory
[38:48] that overcomes the world even our faith
[38:50] we thank you that you absolutely are the
[38:54] same yesterday today and forever
[38:56] and so lord god as you save us
[38:59] you heal us as you lead and guide us
[39:03] you lead us into the truth as you
[39:06] let us see you that lovely one in plain
[39:09] view
[39:09] lord god then we're able to be with you
[39:12] and know you lord god
[39:14] in the power of your resurrection in the
[39:16] fellowship of your sufferings lord
[39:18] and that goes so much deeper than signs
[39:20] and wonders and miracles
[39:22] though that is you also lord god and
[39:25] we're thankful for it
[39:26] lord when we need some medicine we reach
[39:28] up and we grab it
[39:30] out of the skies that are full of your
[39:31] promises lord jesus
[39:33] we praise you and we thank you in the
[39:35] name of jesus christ
[39:36] amen hallelujah you may be seated
[39:39] amen brother branham says we all know it
[39:42] that healing is always his will
[39:44] it's just our duty to believe it amen
[39:46] and he'll figure out the rest amen
[39:48] and so i love that he will show me the
[39:51] path of life
[39:52] amen he brought you to the banquet table
[39:55] amen
[39:56] and and so he's given you revelation of
[39:58] who he is
[40:00] which is the path of life amen and so
[40:03] in his presence his fullness of joy amen
[40:05] in that shekinah glory
[40:07] in that intimate place that you and god
[40:10] get together amen and then he reveals
[40:13] himself
[40:14] in that intimacy and what does that
[40:16] bring it brings confidence it brings
[40:18] a spirit of victory it brings a spirit
[40:21] of overcoming to know that your husband
[40:23] knows
[40:24] all about you amen hallelujah and it
[40:26] says in here at thy right hand there are
[40:29] pleasures forevermore
[40:30] the right hand is the hand of power amen
[40:33] it even says in revelation that he he
[40:36] causes his bride to sit
[40:38] with her in his throne amen and his
[40:41] throne
[40:42] is his authority and power over
[40:44] everything that is created
[40:45] you are eternal amen everything else is
[40:48] created praise the lord
[40:50] amen i'm just gonna have to take it off
[40:53] right now
[40:53] amen because i might get excited
[40:58] praise the lord but i like to see god
[41:00] revealed amen
[41:01] praise the lord and so that power and
[41:04] authority
[41:05] is the sign of the end time and so i'm
[41:07] here tonight
[41:08] is that in your heart stand up amen
[41:11] and and go in front of the world go in
[41:14] front of the devil and say i'm not
[41:15] afraid of you anymore
[41:17] because my husband is behind me he's
[41:19] before me he's all around me
[41:21] and everything he said is true and you
[41:23] are now
[41:24] you are on defense the devil is on
[41:26] defense you are on
[41:27] offense amen hallelujah and so there's
[41:31] pleasures forevermore
[41:33] and so we're in a real day of refreshing
[41:35] this is a glorious time to be alive
[41:38] and god is using everything that is
[41:40] around us to refresh our soul
[41:42] praise the lord jesus amen the devil has
[41:45] no
[41:46] rights in the flesh of the believer but
[41:48] what we have a right to do is take the
[41:50] word of god and speak it
[41:52] and and trample right over him and go
[41:54] forward amen
[41:56] hallelujah here's a little quote amen
[41:58] now notice the first thing was a
[41:59] refreshment
[42:00] what makes the seed grow did you ever
[42:02] get up in the morning and find the dew
[42:04] that fell down from heaven and refreshes
[42:06] the earth
[42:07] how does it refresh it when it's at
[42:09] peace
[42:10] the dew don't fall in daytime the dew
[42:13] falls in the night time amen
[42:16] when everything is at peace and you're
[42:18] going brother uh
[42:20] just wait the dew can never fall on you
[42:22] my brother
[42:23] as long as you're fussing and arguing
[42:26] and stewing about the things
[42:28] here on this earth he says get along
[42:31] with god and let the dew drops
[42:33] of mercy fall upon you in the stillness
[42:36] he goes he goes into a few songs but he
[42:38] goes how that god
[42:40] can get his believer with the curtains
[42:42] dropped
[42:43] around him alone to himself he will
[42:46] bring down a refreshing from heaven
[42:48] that there's no other person amen
[42:51] individual walk
[42:52] or no other way in the world ever know
[42:55] it
[42:56] only he that's laying there only you
[42:58] know it amen hallelujah
[43:00] and he takes all of this stuff that's
[43:03] out there
[43:04] and he he allows you to as his bride to
[43:06] to come in tight into him amen
[43:09] and he refreshes you and that's why you
[43:11] can walk out and be rejoicing that he's
[43:13] the same yesterday today and forever
[43:15] you can walk out that those children
[43:17] that you bore in your body
[43:19] that you speak it over them and that
[43:21] holy spirit has gone out
[43:22] and they have to obey the holy spirit
[43:25] amen
[43:26] blessed be the name of the lord amen
[43:28] that is thus saith the lord that
[43:30] is your right amen hallelujah
[43:34] i love it and so you were being
[43:36] refreshed in this time
[43:37] oh it's a glorious time to be alive amen
[43:41] and so these are the days of elijah amen
[43:44] hallelujah these are the days where
[43:47] jesus christ is proving himself amen
[43:50] to you to the church of the living god
[43:53] amen
[43:54] he's already he's gathering and bundling
[43:57] all the others but
[43:58] you he is maturing in him this is a time
[44:02] not to be caught up in in the spirits of
[44:04] laodicea
[44:05] in the churchianity and the politics and
[44:08] all that stuff
[44:09] get along with god and let that
[44:10] refreshing fall in your life amen
[44:13] look at psalm 91 that is in the old
[44:16] testament
[44:16] but it absolutely states the position of
[44:19] the believer
[44:21] amen it states exactly how he cares how
[44:24] he feels
[44:25] he who dwells in the secret place of the
[44:27] most high
[44:28] that kind of sounds like the little room
[44:30] to me hallelujah shall
[44:32] he he he'll he'll he'll bless him amen
[44:35] there's another one
[44:36] out of jeremiah 17 where it says he he
[44:38] will be like a tree by waters
[44:41] the heat will not brown the leaves and
[44:43] the fruit will keep bearing
[44:45] even in the time of dryness amen the the
[44:48] fruit will keep coming amen
[44:50] that's how he thinks about you so what's
[44:52] a little chaos going to do to the
[44:54] believer amen
[44:55] you are still bearing fruit you're still
[44:58] manifesting jesus christ
[45:00] the same yesterday today and forever and
[45:03] we're going to sprinkle
[45:04] some testimonies in here amen not from
[45:06] the past
[45:07] not from brother branham amen not for my
[45:10] dad
[45:11] hallelujah because there's plenty of
[45:13] those hey man
[45:16] amen and and because a lot of men from
[45:19] that age
[45:20] had a lot of supernatural with them and
[45:23] god's still here and he's still the same
[45:27] and it's rugged faith and god still does
[45:31] exactly the same things and so god is
[45:34] not only proving himself to his bride
[45:36] but she is realizing
[45:40] that she will stay with the word by the
[45:43] spirit amen a mental revelation you
[45:46] are going to go back into the world amen
[45:48] but she realizes that
[45:50] because of the holy spirit that has done
[45:52] something in her soul
[45:54] she is staying with the word and things
[45:56] are going on around her
[45:57] and she's going wow man i still have a
[45:59] desire to go to church
[46:01] even when we were on on video amen i i
[46:04] wanted to be in church
[46:05] and now that it's gone uh then i'm back
[46:07] in church
[46:08] but i tell you we've lost people
[46:11] because a little too long
[46:14] amen and you get a little see laodicea
[46:18] is more lethal than what you think amen
[46:20] but see the bride we're going to stay
[46:22] positive the bride
[46:24] you can't wait to get back amen you
[46:26] can't wait to sing the songs of zion
[46:28] amen
[46:29] and you realize that man look at all the
[46:31] others though i pray for their souls and
[46:33] i'm believing that they're going to be
[46:34] back
[46:34] but isn't it a miracle that i want to be
[46:36] in church amen
[46:38] that i want to praise the lord and so
[46:40] for the bride
[46:41] here's the thing for the bride to abide
[46:43] under the mighty hand of god
[46:45] she must abide under all the word amen
[46:49] hallelujah amen she can't hope so
[46:52] and and i'm not going to say who or
[46:54] where but i i've
[46:56] known people that lately
[47:00] that they you know kovitz
[47:03] in their family and and and they want to
[47:06] come and be a part of a body and they're
[47:08] saying oh don't worry about it brother
[47:11] i'm saying you know well you're not
[47:14] coming
[47:16] am i afraid no but see
[47:20] there's no basis for their faith
[47:24] they have this faith wonderful people
[47:26] awesome people but the faith is here
[47:29] we say that's very judgmental brother
[47:31] well i
[47:32] i can i'm not going to list it but i can
[47:34] list out whole things how they break the
[47:36] laws every day
[47:38] see but in their mind they say god sent
[47:41] a prophet i believe i believe this
[47:43] message
[47:44] and so nothing's going to harm me
[47:47] amen but see that's different and so
[47:50] let's look at a little a little uh
[47:52] testament to that
[47:53] in first samuel 15 and 14 through 23.
[47:57] first samuel 15-14 amen through 23
[48:02] and samuel said i like it what meaneth
[48:05] in the bleeding of the sheep in mine
[48:07] ears and the loin of the oxen which i
[48:11] hear and saul said
[48:12] they did you notice he never took
[48:15] responsibility
[48:16] oh it was the people amen it's like what
[48:18] kind of pastor are you to let your
[48:20] congregation overrun the word amen
[48:23] hallelujah that's why you need ministry
[48:25] to stay with the word
[48:27] the word the word the word amen
[48:30] hallelujah he says
[48:34] they have brought them from the
[48:35] malachites samuel is going
[48:38] saul who's king in this in this court
[48:40] amen
[48:42] and so on down he says wherefore then
[48:45] did thou not obey the voice of the lord
[48:47] but sits
[48:48] but it's fly up on the spoil he's saying
[48:50] why did you bring all the
[48:52] the best stuff back and it's evil in the
[48:54] sight of the lord
[48:56] and saul said in december yeah i have
[48:58] obeyed the voice of the lord
[49:00] pastor i believe god sent a problem i
[49:02] believe that the seals are open
[49:04] i believe this and and yea
[49:07] i have obeyed the voice of the lord and
[49:09] have gone the way which the lord sent me
[49:11] amen and have brought a gag the king of
[49:14] the of
[49:15] amalek and have utterly destroyed the
[49:18] amalekites
[49:19] but the people took of the spoiled sheep
[49:22] and auction and the chief of the things
[49:24] amen that were destroyed and they did it
[49:26] for good amen
[49:28] pastor i won the lottery and here's my
[49:30] tithes
[49:32] no amen that's truth
[49:36] that has happened amen hallelujah
[49:40] but see and samuel said hat the lord
[49:44] as great delight and burnt offerings and
[49:46] sacrifices
[49:48] as in obeying the voice of the lord in
[49:50] this day
[49:51] amen we don't need a big education we
[49:54] don't need to
[49:55] have of a a 13 degree black belt in the
[49:58] message amen
[50:00] hallelujah we don't need to be great
[50:02] teachers so that you can't even touch
[50:04] the ground amen
[50:06] but all he wants is obedience to god so
[50:09] loved the world that he gave his only
[50:10] begotten son
[50:12] he wants you know be baptized in the
[50:14] name of the lord jesus christ for the
[50:15] remission of your sins and you shall
[50:16] receive the gift of the holy ghost
[50:18] behold to obey is better than sacrifice
[50:22] and to hearken unto the fat of rams
[50:24] for rebellion is as the sign of
[50:27] witchcraft
[50:28] and stubbornness as iniquity and
[50:30] idolatry
[50:31] because the house rejected the word of
[50:32] the lord
[50:34] amen he hath also rejected him from
[50:37] you from being king amen that was a
[50:39] definite amen saul still went to heaven
[50:42] and so i i see everything that's going
[50:45] on today and this is a snapshot these
[50:47] people aren't
[50:48] they're not into hell but but if you
[50:50] i've never seen so many old ladies
[50:53] old sisters who are rebels
[50:56] today it's like man sister
[51:00] that that 20 year old woman's coming out
[51:03] amen
[51:05] it's like wow that's amazing
[51:08] hallelujah amen they don't have blue
[51:11] hair but
[51:12] but i just tell you you know it's
[51:15] because
[51:16] just because you're old doesn't mean
[51:17] you're dead amen
[51:19] but we need to be dead we need to be old
[51:21] and dead
[51:22] hallelujah but see we are led
[51:25] in this word to stay exactly with what
[51:29] the word says
[51:30] and when i say that i actually mean it
[51:32] read my lips
[51:33] stay exactly with what the word says
[51:36] not your opinion not rich's opinion not
[51:39] so and so to spend
[51:40] but exactly what it says amen
[51:44] but then they come well but brothers i
[51:46] don't care
[51:47] amen stay exactly with what the word
[51:50] says
[51:51] because then you were under the
[51:53] protection of the lord in these last
[51:55] days
[51:56] brother rahm says you are not under the
[51:58] protection just because you agree with
[51:59] this message
[52:00] you're not under the protection just
[52:01] because you believe in signs and wonders
[52:03] and miracles
[52:04] you are not under the protection of god
[52:05] just because you go to the right church
[52:07] this is an individual walk and there's
[52:09] gonna be thousands and tens of thousands
[52:11] of message people will be in hell
[52:14] but you won't because it's a revelation
[52:18] to you amen and you don't want all those
[52:20] people to go to hell
[52:21] you want you your spirit is christ that
[52:24] all should live
[52:25] and that's why you're here to stand in
[52:26] the gap for them amen and amen
[52:29] but you are you can walk around under
[52:31] the protection and the leadership of the
[52:33] holy ghost
[52:34] oh i love it amen it's simple
[52:38] the simple gospel look at what john 14
[52:41] says
[52:42] 14-15 if you love me keep my
[52:45] commandments
[52:46] amen you know what
[52:49] if you if you can't love your brother
[52:52] you don't love god
[52:53] if you can't love your sister you can't
[52:55] love god i don't care what you say
[52:57] i don't care if your dress is so long it
[53:00] it flies out the back of the pickup when
[53:02] you're driving to church
[53:04] and your hair your you can use it to to
[53:07] raise and lower your husband out the
[53:08] second story
[53:09] window amen or the men they can have
[53:13] just the right look amen but but that
[53:16] doesn't mean anything
[53:17] brother branham was in a meeting and
[53:19] this pentecostal minister comes up and
[53:20] goes brother man i thought you were a
[53:22] pentecostal
[53:23] he goes well brother i am and he goes
[53:25] that woman on the piano
[53:27] she had short hair she had this she had
[53:30] that man tight
[53:31] everything and brother branham just to
[53:33] poke the bear he goes
[53:35] didn't she have a good spirit
[53:38] and and you know that probably threw him
[53:40] all off he goes brother
[53:42] i agree with you she wasn't dressed
[53:44] right her hair was short
[53:46] but he goes brother she's a brand new
[53:49] christian and god has really done
[53:51] something for
[53:52] amen praise the lord jesus amen
[53:55] amen that's leadership that's wisdom of
[53:58] a mature christian amen
[54:00] but if you love me keep my commandments
[54:02] just do what i say
[54:03] amen john 15 and 10 if you keep my
[54:06] commandments you shall abide in my love
[54:09] even as i have kept my father's
[54:11] commandments and abide in his love
[54:13] hallelujah that's why the word was
[54:15] restored that's why the revelation
[54:18] of jesus christ coming into plain view
[54:21] fully into plain view
[54:22] so that we could fully and completely
[54:24] live for him amen
[54:26] hallelujah and see here's the leadership
[54:29] of the lord
[54:29] even before all of these events started
[54:32] we didn't know they were coming
[54:34] most amen some people have had dreams
[54:37] i've been told about it and i say praise
[54:39] the lord
[54:40] but even before he started i
[54:43] god was in he was laying on my heart
[54:46] to to just really cast all of my care
[54:50] amen like my parents did cast everything
[54:53] they didn't have
[54:54] insurance we had to go to the you know
[54:56] the cut rate dentist and
[54:58] and i can't blame this on the cut-rate
[55:00] barber but uh
[55:01] we went to all the cheap stuff all the
[55:03] poor people we were poor amen
[55:06] hallelujah but we cast all of our care
[55:10] upon him he fed us
[55:11] amen i didn't miss any meals praise the
[55:13] lord but he was always there amen
[55:16] but god was leading me he was saying
[55:18] he's go
[55:19] back to the reality of what i was when
[55:22] you were young and charities families
[55:24] the same way go
[55:25] back to the provision go back to the
[55:27] love go
[55:28] back to the victory go back to the
[55:30] reality amen
[55:31] and and i will take care of you in that
[55:34] place amen
[55:35] hallelujah and so uh and we're gonna
[55:38] talk about this
[55:39] in a minute but see i was casting
[55:42] already casting
[55:44] amen away the thinking of the world oh
[55:47] you gotta have so much in here
[55:49] and you're and and and i go to retire
[55:51] and you know the stock market goes down
[55:53] to eighteen
[55:53] thousand hasn't been there in a long
[55:56] time
[55:58] but i just kept say praise the lord
[55:59] you're gonna take care of me
[56:01] amen and so i was pulling myself away
[56:04] from
[56:05] everything that seemed reasonable and
[56:06] that's what you have to do in this
[56:08] message
[56:08] pull your mind away from what brother
[56:11] so-and-so says or brother so-and-so
[56:13] says or brother so-and-so says amen
[56:15] hallelujah what would you do if you
[56:17] didn't have the internet you would have
[56:18] to listen to brother paul amen
[56:21] hallelujah and so your pastor is
[56:24] ordained to see you through not
[56:26] brother chad or brother biscuit or
[56:28] brother you plug in the person
[56:30] they're all wonderful people but what
[56:31] i'm saying is that
[56:33] we have to cast away the religiosity
[56:36] that is around this message
[56:37] we have to get into the message which is
[56:41] jesus christ and in him crucified amen
[56:44] hallelujah amen praise the lord that's
[56:47] why i don't have to stand here and have
[56:48] a bunch of quotes because
[56:49] the quote master is within me the quote
[56:52] master is within you amen
[56:55] and so all the current events i'm not
[56:57] looking at that satan i'm not looking at
[56:59] the social security i'm not looking at
[57:01] the retirement
[57:01] i'm not looking at all these things amen
[57:04] hallelujah
[57:05] amen i'm casting all the care of my
[57:07] family upon my husband
[57:09] hallelujah focusing on what god has said
[57:13] and so i gave i've already given my wife
[57:15] and family
[57:16] and finances and our health and the
[57:18] ministry to god
[57:19] it's all his amen and so
[57:22] if you have the right kind of husband
[57:24] he's gonna work and provide
[57:26] for you amen and so i think god's a
[57:29] little bit greater than a natural
[57:31] husband amen
[57:32] and so he has already provided
[57:35] like the song says and so all that a
[57:38] believer has and
[57:40] is is of the lord amen i'm nothing
[57:43] i'm fat and bold and i'm not very smart
[57:46] but
[57:46] but we live on the blessings from the
[57:49] previous generation
[57:51] we are living on the blessings from my
[57:53] parents we're living on the blessings
[57:55] from tom and barb amen
[57:56] charities mom and dad and now we were
[57:59] wanting and desiring to do the right
[58:01] thing
[58:02] and if the lord should tarry then the
[58:03] children will live on the blessings of
[58:05] this amen
[58:06] oh praise the lord you're not only
[58:10] living for you but you're living for
[58:11] others and brother abraham says eternal
[58:13] life
[58:14] is living for others amen is looking
[58:16] heaven in the face amen
[58:19] hallelujah amen that's in the message
[58:22] he said brother you're not successful
[58:24] because you did anything
[58:25] it's because your parents sacrificed
[58:27] amen
[58:29] hallelujah so where is our big brain
[58:32] where are our big muscles nowhere amen
[58:36] and so nothing of the believer is
[58:39] because
[58:39] of you even it's by his grace unmerited
[58:43] favor
[58:43] do you know what brother brown used
[58:45] mercy and grace all the time and we we
[58:47] do that also
[58:48] you know what mercy means it's pity on
[58:50] the miserable that's you and i
[58:52] before god came we were miserable
[58:55] and those who are in misery amen you
[58:58] were having fun you thought out in the
[58:59] world
[59:00] but god's seen you is miserable amen
[59:03] hallelujah
[59:04] and so we know that in first peter 5
[59:08] 6 and 7 it says humble yourselves
[59:11] therefore unto the mighty hand of god
[59:14] that he may exalt you in due time
[59:17] oh you just get small and he's going to
[59:20] make you big amen
[59:21] amen the bible says and i know that they
[59:24] the prosperity doctrine uses this
[59:26] but this is our term you are not the
[59:28] tale you are the head amen
[59:30] you're not the girlfriend amen but
[59:33] you're the bride amen you get it all
[59:36] hallelujah humble yourselves therefore
[59:39] under the mighty hand of god
[59:40] that he may exalt you in due time
[59:43] casting
[59:44] all of your care upon him for he careth
[59:47] for you
[59:48] amen amen and i heard this quote the
[59:52] other day and
[59:53] i put it in here but i know
[59:56] that it's that they have a law here a
[59:59] fire marshal's law
[1:00:01] just so many you have to leave so much
[1:00:04] isles and so forth
[1:00:07] and that they can't and that they cannot
[1:00:09] help
[1:00:10] because they because that we are as
[1:00:13] christians
[1:00:14] we've got to do that
[1:00:18] it's a little more restrictive in oregon
[1:00:19] than here
[1:00:22] for the bible said jesus told us to give
[1:00:25] caesar
[1:00:25] those things that pertain to caesar and
[1:00:28] then to god those things that belong to
[1:00:31] god
[1:00:32] so we try to and if we will not obey
[1:00:35] caesar
[1:00:36] it's doubtful that we'd obey god
[1:00:40] and as long as caesar's lost don't
[1:00:42] interfere with gods
[1:00:44] we must obey god first and then these
[1:00:47] fire hazards and so forth well
[1:00:49] they know how to take care of that and
[1:00:51] they told us amen
[1:00:52] and so imagine if you're
[1:00:56] a pastor and somebody's blatantly
[1:00:59] telling you that they go 100 literally
[1:01:01] 100 miles an hour
[1:01:03] everywhere or they they talk about
[1:01:06] the case of wine they have at their
[1:01:07] house and these are message
[1:01:10] believers or or this or
[1:01:13] the slang or the cussing or this but now
[1:01:17] they're good imagine that
[1:01:21] imagine imagine what imagine the
[1:01:24] heartbreak
[1:01:26] well you said you shouldn't be so
[1:01:27] judgment we're not the word judge i
[1:01:30] don't have to say anything it's the word
[1:01:32] hallelujah and so why is all this
[1:01:35] happening it's a woe it's to get the
[1:01:37] bride to shake her a little bit and say
[1:01:39] hey
[1:01:40] hey honey amen you're gonna make it amen
[1:01:42] halle and your failures are just
[1:01:44] one snapshot in the life of god amen
[1:01:48] hallelujah praise the lord but see see
[1:01:51] god is he loves you so much he gives you
[1:01:53] a little
[1:01:54] gospel spanking amen which is
[1:01:56] chastisement he says now get up and go i
[1:01:58] believe in you
[1:01:59] amen you may be an acorn but i see you
[1:02:02] as an oak
[1:02:02] but see the desire of my heart is to
[1:02:05] live for god
[1:02:06] on his terms and if i go to hell doing
[1:02:08] that then i go to hell
[1:02:11] that's the way i feel if i go to hell i
[1:02:14] go to hell
[1:02:15] amen amen because i want to be able to
[1:02:19] be emptied out
[1:02:21] because did you realize that there's no
[1:02:23] man in the message that has any special
[1:02:25] revelation
[1:02:27] [Music]
[1:02:29] it's all god amen
[1:02:32] no special revelations nobody
[1:02:35] because why it's a body ministry
[1:02:39] hey man this is about you the body not
[1:02:42] about brother so-and-so amen
[1:02:44] hallelujah that's that's laodicea
[1:02:48] amen this is about the lovely one this
[1:02:50] is about the bride

[1:02:58] hallelujah amen and so i we just want to
[1:03:01] live emptied out i don't want my own
[1:03:03] thinking if it comes if it goes against
[1:03:05] the word amen
[1:03:06] when when you're diagnosed with
[1:03:08] something you get on the internet and
[1:03:09] start
[1:03:10] uh looking it up brother brown says you
[1:03:12] are not to do that
[1:03:14] he goes get off of there he didn't say
[1:03:16] the internet but he says
[1:03:18] don't go start reading about it you are
[1:03:19] glorifying the devil
[1:03:22] oh brother you know i just don't stick
[1:03:25] my head in the sand
[1:03:26] i'm going maybe you should amen because
[1:03:29] you're glorifying
[1:03:31] the devil not god amen amen when you're
[1:03:34] prayed for
[1:03:35] whether you're at home or up here or
[1:03:36] wherever it is then throw down those
[1:03:39] crutches of the devil get up out of that
[1:03:41] wheelchair of the devil
[1:03:42] and start walking in the light as he is
[1:03:44] in the light amen
[1:03:46] and so i don't really i told some
[1:03:49] brothers the other day

[1:04:14] message thinks
[1:04:15] i know that there's one message one lord
[1:04:18] one baptism one victory one healing amen
[1:04:21] and so i don't regard all the other

[1:09:45] way he speaks with me
[1:09:47] and i was i was in perfect temperature i
[1:09:50] was out fly fishing and i don't fly fish
[1:09:53] but i just it's david all right
[1:09:56] amen but
[1:09:59] it was one of those dreams where i could
[1:10:01] feel there wasn't any humidity it was
[1:10:04] warm and no breeze i'm thinking this is
[1:10:07] awesome
[1:10:08] and i'm fly fishing i decide i said
[1:10:10] there's a hole down there i'll cast into
[1:10:11] it
[1:10:12] well i got my line caught on the top of
[1:10:14] this
[1:10:15] rock and so i went down there
[1:10:18] and i'm walking you know how you do
[1:10:20] you're on tippy toes trying to get it
[1:10:21] off there
[1:10:22] and i'm coming around and i come to this
[1:10:24] side of the rock and it's a it's kind of
[1:10:26] a
[1:10:27] shallow cave maybe about 10 feet but
[1:10:30] the rocks are set up to where i could
[1:10:32] see through the corner
[1:10:34] and so i got back there and like i said
[1:10:36] it was so real
[1:10:38] and here come a lion a big african lion
[1:10:41] off the hill and it was walking through
[1:10:45] and i just moved in to that rock
[1:10:48] and i stayed there and i watched him as
[1:10:50] he went over here and he went up amen
[1:10:52] but see god was telling us that
[1:10:55] he is the cleft of the rock and our
[1:10:58] safety is in him amen
[1:11:00] hallelujah praise the lord we don't have
[1:11:03] time to tell
[1:11:04] other stories like that but anyway that
[1:11:06] was for me
[1:11:07] that was me amen to encourage my faith
[1:11:11] as a pastor amen i don't want any wolves
[1:11:14] coming in and taking away
[1:11:15] sheep and so i have to sit there with
[1:11:17] with a
[1:11:18] 30 odd 6 and a scope amen and i
[1:11:21] and i may shoot them but then i want to
[1:11:23] pour in the balm of gilead amen
[1:11:25] hallelujah
[1:11:26] hallelujah amen glory
[1:11:30] take them off their feet then they can
[1:11:32] listen amen
[1:11:33] hallelujah but see psalm 8 5 and 6.
[1:11:38] psalm 8 5-6
[1:11:44] for thou hast made him a little lower
[1:11:46] than the angels
[1:11:48] and has crowned him with glory
[1:11:53] thou madest him to have dominion over
[1:11:55] the works of the hands
[1:11:57] thou hast put all things
[1:12:01] under his feet all things
[1:12:04] let's see you are an eternal being
[1:12:09] amen and everything you see is creation
[1:12:12] who has control amen absolutely
[1:12:16] his eternal spirit through you you can
[1:12:19] speak and go forward you can you can
[1:12:22] take authority amen
[1:12:23] all the hotels we've been staying at we
[1:12:25] take authority over all the spirits amen
[1:12:28] hallelujah brother branham here's that
[1:12:30] example
[1:12:31] these people they said brother branham
[1:12:33] this morning we got up and
[1:12:35] we're thinking that you're the messiah
[1:12:36] he goes oh oh sister
[1:12:38] he goes nah he goes you know why you
[1:12:41] think that because there was people in
[1:12:42] that hotel room the night before who
[1:12:44] thought that
[1:12:44] right hallelujah amen
[1:12:48] and so tonight you here in nampa
[1:12:52] he has put everything that you can see
[1:12:54] under your feet
[1:12:56] hallelujah amen what why do we know that
[1:13:00] amen we don't know that by
[1:13:01] denominational thinking
[1:13:03] we don't know that by partial revelation
[1:13:05] of the church ages
[1:13:07] we know that by the full revelation of
[1:13:09] jesus christ amen
[1:13:11] even this cross amen brother says the
[1:13:14] blood is for
[1:13:15] you even it's primarily for your
[1:13:18] mistakes amen
[1:13:19] hallelujah the wife the bride of jesus
[1:13:22] christ
[1:13:22] and so we're living in the day of
[1:13:25] authority
[1:13:26] brother bam says authority authority
[1:13:28] authority is the sign of the end
[1:13:31] speaking and living out through the wife
[1:13:34] amen
[1:13:34] and so the natural husband wants to
[1:13:36] nurture that wife
[1:13:37] amen paul even says that she's to run
[1:13:40] the household
[1:13:42] amen not the way leia decia
[1:13:46] does it but she's supposed to
[1:13:49] what what you can't be there with the
[1:13:52] checklist
[1:13:53] she's supposed to know what to do she
[1:13:55] runs a household proverbs 31
[1:13:57] woman ran the household amen
[1:14:01] hallelujah and so
[1:14:04] authority speaking through you
[1:14:07] hallelujah see my wife can only manifest
[1:14:11] and live out my words if she listens to
[1:14:14] me
[1:14:15] and if she believes me and then performs
[1:14:18] them
[1:14:18] that's how she knows that my words are
[1:14:22] true and that's how i know that she
[1:14:23] loves me
[1:14:24] is because is because for me that's my
[1:14:27] love language for her to do things
[1:14:29] uh like that and for her it's snickers
[1:14:33] amen no but
[1:14:36] she doesn't need all the big gifts and
[1:14:38] big rings and everything
[1:14:39] and but uh but we
[1:14:42] you know i tell her i love her and i
[1:14:45] appreciate her
[1:14:46] and that she's the only one for me see
[1:14:48] you nurture those things
[1:14:49] in a natural marriage and it's the same
[1:14:52] thing with god
[1:14:53] and so as his wife we are under
[1:14:55] subjection to his word
[1:14:58] as we walk in the spirit amen that's why
[1:15:01] the holy spirit is so
[1:15:02] important and brother brown says that
[1:15:06] when we do that then we are little gods
[1:15:09] on this earth
[1:15:10] we are god's helpers little gods on this
[1:15:13] earth amen
[1:15:14] then that's when you are as righteous as
[1:15:17] god
[1:15:18] amen hallelujah you you have no fear
[1:15:21] amen
[1:15:22] this will get afraid your spirit realm
[1:15:24] will be tempted to be afraid
[1:15:26] but on the inside of the inside there is
[1:15:28] no fear amen what shall man do unto me
[1:15:31] what shall man do unto my children amen
[1:15:33] because
[1:15:34] something is different in you amen
[1:15:37] because
[1:15:38] now amen brother brown says that as you
[1:15:40] walk around you're giving out virtue
[1:15:42] literal virtue amen hallelujah amen
[1:15:46] hallelujah no spirit no subjection
[1:15:50] and i'm not saying that you won't but
[1:15:52] just like the disciples
[1:15:54] they blew it all the time
[1:15:57] but they were going to receive the holy
[1:15:59] spirit
[1:16:01] amen if you took a snapshot of peter
[1:16:04] cussing and swearing and denying christ
[1:16:06] and him looking at him
[1:16:08] amen you would say he is a low life he's
[1:16:11] nothing
[1:16:12] but he had the keys to the kingdom amen
[1:16:15] and so you can't
[1:16:16] judge on a person's actions amen right
[1:16:18] now you
[1:16:19] quit judging your kids like that amen
[1:16:23] get your eyes off of their their ecstasy
[1:16:26] or their mollies or whatever or they're
[1:16:28] dope amen get your eyes off the beer and
[1:16:30] the alcohol that they're drinking
[1:16:31] start speaking who they are honey you
[1:16:34] know what
[1:16:35] amen i'm ah you're a believer amen you
[1:16:38] just don't know it yet
[1:16:39] ali we had some visitors a while back
[1:16:43] and i was sitting here preaching and
[1:16:46] some of them teenagers they were like
[1:16:48] yeah whatever and so i said you know
[1:16:50] what i was there i know what you're
[1:16:52] thinking
[1:16:53] afterwards they shot out of there and
[1:16:56] would not even come around us
[1:16:57] because the devil doesn't like to be
[1:16:59] exposed because when you know who you
[1:17:01] are then
[1:17:02] uh oh praise the lord jesus but see i
[1:17:05] you want to cry out
[1:17:06] god send the holy ghost after him amen
[1:17:09] because we love him to death hallelujah
[1:17:11] no spirit no subjection amen
[1:17:14] but with the spirit when he the holy
[1:17:16] spirit comes then you begin to grow into
[1:17:19] a submissive wife
[1:17:20] to the word of god i don't have to
[1:17:22] figure things out i just know that he
[1:17:24] loves me
[1:17:25] and so why do you think satan is so much
[1:17:28] against that
[1:17:29] supernatural and living presence of god
[1:17:32] why because that revelation
[1:17:35] is what vindicates the word it's not
[1:17:38] your belief in this message
[1:17:39] it's the revelation of your belief in
[1:17:42] this message amen
[1:17:43] that is absolutely that's thus saith the
[1:17:45] message that's not brother rich that's
[1:17:47] brother branham amen
[1:17:49] hallelujah our mental faith
[1:17:52] and agreement on this message is not the
[1:17:55] vindication of the word
[1:17:57] amen the devil believes it mentally he's
[1:18:00] not your brother
[1:18:02] but it's the holy spirit in you oh
[1:18:06] amen just let him work just let him feel
[1:18:09] you
[1:18:10] just say lord i want more revelation
[1:18:12] amen lord i've tried to stop i tried to
[1:18:14] stop he goes quit
[1:18:15] trying to stop this quit trying to do
[1:18:18] this quit trying to do that
[1:18:19] let me do it amen oh brother
[1:18:23] one of the brothers at the church he was
[1:18:27] with my mom and dad way back 50s and 60s
[1:18:31] very gifted man lots of
[1:18:35] accurate prophecies amen but an
[1:18:37] alcoholic his whole life
[1:18:40] and he called up a while back and said
[1:18:42] is this rich cobb i said yeah he goes do
[1:18:43] you still preach the message praise the
[1:18:45] lord we do come up
[1:18:46] he goes well i'm coming you know in my
[1:18:48] natural i'm thinking
[1:18:50] i don't know what's this gonna be
[1:18:53] but he walked in and he
[1:18:57] his nose wasn't red like it used to be
[1:18:59] and there's a different spirit about him
[1:19:02] and so he gave a testimony he said i was
[1:19:04] sitting there in my trailer
[1:19:06] see god can even save you in a mobile
[1:19:08] home
[1:19:09] amen praise the lord
[1:19:13] hallelujah he said i was sitting there
[1:19:18] and he goes you know what i've given up
[1:19:19] he goes god i can't do it
[1:19:22] he's 86 86.
[1:19:25] god i just can't do it so i'm not even
[1:19:28] going to try because i don't want to be
[1:19:30] a disappointment
[1:19:30] so god came in that trailer and said how
[1:19:33] long are you going to be this way he
[1:19:36] goes
[1:19:36] are you ready to for me to set you free
[1:19:39] and i'm paraphrasing because yes
[1:19:44] not an alcoholic anymore right there
[1:19:48] hallelujah and so he's coming to church
[1:19:51] so the devil throws this ailment on him
[1:19:53] where he can't come he can't drive he
[1:19:55] can't hardly get out of the house
[1:19:57] and the doctors don't know what to do
[1:19:58] they can't do anything
[1:20:01] and so he asked for prayer from
[1:20:05] the bride the body
[1:20:08] and when the body prayed i didn't know
[1:20:10] about it till
[1:20:11] like several weeks later but he gave the
[1:20:14] testimony that
[1:20:15] that day when the body prayed that thing
[1:20:18] dried up and he has it no more
[1:20:20] amen amen no more great men
[1:20:23] though god still uses people of faith
[1:20:26] absolutely
[1:20:27] but it is now the body the elisha
[1:20:30] ministry a second book of acts is being
[1:20:33] written
[1:20:33] amen hallelujah hallelujah
[1:20:37] amen and so why is it
[1:20:40] what is it that vindicates your natural
[1:20:42] marriage
[1:20:43] well brother we got this ring and we had
[1:20:45] a nice ceremony that cost
[1:20:47] forty thousand or sixty some of the guys
[1:20:50] at work i'm just going are you
[1:20:52] crazy well i had to get this five carat
[1:20:55] ring
[1:20:57] and my old captain his he had different
[1:20:59] motives but he goes
[1:21:00] he goes matt he goes i'll do it for 2
[1:21:03] 000 and you'll have
[1:21:04] all the beer you want
[1:21:10] but but the people they you know
[1:21:13] well we had a good we had this what
[1:21:15] happens what do i run into over and over
[1:21:17] and over two years down the line
[1:21:20] you know what it's not like i thought
[1:21:24] brother i don't you know i have all this
[1:21:26] lust going on even though i'm married
[1:21:28] and and she well i don't like him as
[1:21:30] much like i used to
[1:21:33] amen what see
[1:21:36] the that ceremony is necessary but it
[1:21:39] doesn't vindicate
[1:21:40] marriage amen but see what vindicates
[1:21:44] marriage is that both of you know and
[1:21:46] you can
[1:21:47] plug in every definition of no right now
[1:21:49] you want to
[1:21:50] each other personally on all
[1:21:54] levels of intimacy amen
[1:21:57] i have complete faith in my my wife and
[1:21:59] she does with me
[1:22:00] that what we say comes to pass amen
[1:22:05] and so the message of the hour
[1:22:09] has come to vindicate the word amen your
[1:22:12] love and we're going to hit it again
[1:22:14] so don't worry but the message of the
[1:22:18] hour has come to vindicate the word
[1:22:21] being the revelation of jesus christ
[1:22:24] amen
[1:22:25] and so and i paraphrase this but you can
[1:22:27] look it up if you want to
[1:22:28] but uh people in all different kinds of
[1:22:31] churches
[1:22:32] they don't know these things you you are
[1:22:34] a privileged race you are a super race
[1:22:38] not because of your color amen but
[1:22:40] because of
[1:22:41] your predestination amen and and they
[1:22:44] don't know these things
[1:22:45] and so they just hope their sins are
[1:22:47] forgiven how many people do you know
[1:22:49] come to church
[1:22:50] oh god i hope that you love me i hope
[1:22:52] i'm going to heaven
[1:22:53] and he goes would you shut up with the
[1:22:55] hope amen
[1:22:57] amen as a pastor i want to say get that
[1:22:59] out of your dictionary
[1:23:01] amen either he loves you or he doesn't
[1:23:03] did he take you out of the pit or didn't
[1:23:05] he amen
[1:23:06] has he put you on a path to
[1:23:08] righteousness then let him lead amen
[1:23:11] hallelujah but they don't know if their
[1:23:13] sins are all forgiven they're hoping
[1:23:15] they are healed
[1:23:16] but the true believer amen you can be
[1:23:18] the shabbiest
[1:23:20] the most ignorant or you can be the
[1:23:22] richest believer there is
[1:23:23] but you know that you know that you know
[1:23:26] amen
[1:23:27] and because the devil's there throwing
[1:23:28] rocks at you you are this you are
[1:23:31] that and you go i don't care what you
[1:23:33] say because my husband has a witness on
[1:23:36] the inside
[1:23:38] because what he has already done it

[1:24:23] when it's going to happen i don't know
[1:24:25] when these things are going to manifest
[1:24:27] but all is well
[1:24:29] amen hallelujah amen
[1:24:32] see we still have to fight even though
[1:24:34] it's all ours
[1:24:36] we still have to fight for every inch of
[1:24:38] ground but the ground is yours
[1:24:40] amen your desire is yours that's why
[1:24:44] he changes your desires because he wants
[1:24:46] to put his in there it's yours amen

[1:25:59] i pulled the car back and grabbed her

[1:26:27] in a minute
[1:26:29] that's why silas isn't here he's
[1:26:32] building hours towards his commercial
[1:26:34] certificate but he plans on flying over
[1:26:38] to caldwell soon
[1:26:39] for a cross country for that
[1:26:42] so he might call somebody for lunch i
[1:26:44] don't know
[1:26:47] hebrews 4 14 scene then that we have a
[1:26:50] great high priest
[1:26:51] that is passed into the heavens jesus
[1:26:53] the son of god
[1:26:54] let us hold fast our profession that's
[1:26:57] why
[1:26:57] god sent a prophet in a message so that
[1:27:00] we could start talking
[1:27:02] like a believer amen brother brahma says
[1:27:05] they just didn't get to talk about
[1:27:07] get around to talk about the message
[1:27:08] they got around to live it amen
[1:27:10] and that's why that's why we do more
[1:27:12] than talk about the great things that
[1:27:14] were in his life but we're saying oh
[1:27:16] brother or sister
[1:27:17] do you know what god did because of what
[1:27:19] he showed me uh my my i'm set free
[1:27:22] or or now the the people at school at
[1:27:24] work are at the market they're starting
[1:27:25] to ask
[1:27:26] questions amen because you're starting
[1:27:28] to give out
[1:27:30] right and he says now i'ma skip down to
[1:27:33] the last
[1:27:34] let us therefore come boldly he says
[1:27:37] jesus the son of god let us hold fast
[1:27:40] our profession
[1:27:41] let us come boldly unto the throne of
[1:27:44] grace
[1:27:45] that we may obtain mercy and find grace
[1:27:49] to help in the time of need amen
[1:27:51] hallelujah
[1:27:53] all right let's look at a bold woman
[1:27:57] amen queen esther she came
[1:28:00] boldly into the presence of the king
[1:28:04] amen why did she do that
[1:28:08] oh king live forever no
[1:28:12] she came in king live forever
[1:28:15] that's boldness because she was humble
[1:28:20] but she knew see boldness comes by the
[1:28:22] love
[1:28:24] that you know god has for you and you
[1:28:27] come boldly
[1:28:28] that way to your husband or your wife
[1:28:30] because you know the love that you have
[1:28:32] for her amen
[1:28:33] and so i'll admit it i'm not
[1:28:36] i know different cultures have their
[1:28:39] traditions
[1:28:40] but when you start using that excuse
[1:28:44] to live with your wife or husband i say
[1:28:46] that's trash
[1:28:49] trash amen
[1:28:53] amen you don't get to do that
[1:28:56] if you're a believer because when the
[1:28:58] holy spirit comes what did brother let's
[1:29:00] just use germans
[1:29:01] because i'm german and some of us are
[1:29:02] germans brother brown says
[1:29:04] this family that lived down the street
[1:29:05] from the church i'd walked by and i said
[1:29:07] good morning how are you god bless you
[1:29:09] and they said this
[1:29:14] but see he said some of their relatives
[1:29:16] got saved
[1:29:17] and you know what that german spirit's
[1:29:19] gone all of a sudden
[1:29:21] they're sweet and friendly they still
[1:29:23] like sauerkraut and
[1:29:24] and broughton and whatever else and amen
[1:29:29] they still have their they're proud of
[1:29:31] their heritage they might even have some
[1:29:33] lederhosen
[1:29:34] but you see their spirit has
[1:29:37] changed amen hallelujah
[1:29:42] praise the lord one of our brothers from
[1:29:45] fresno
[1:29:46] if if you walked up to him and you
[1:29:49] didn't know it
[1:29:50] you'd be afraid of him tattoos
[1:29:53] everywhere
[1:29:55] but you don't judge him by that you you
[1:29:58] get around him a little bit
[1:29:59] and you see that and he was he had some
[1:30:02] demonic
[1:30:04] experiences
[1:30:09] but he's a he's a good man now the holy
[1:30:12] spirit's
[1:30:12] doing things amen hallelujah praise the
[1:30:16] lord
[1:30:16] and so that's the thing here is that
[1:30:19] is that and i forgot my thought amen
[1:30:23] hallelujah but but you see that when we
[1:30:26] come
[1:30:26] boldly into his presence it's not by who
[1:30:28] we are what we've done
[1:30:29] but we come in by a changed life and so
[1:30:32] i don't care if you're red brown yellow
[1:30:34] black and white
[1:30:35] amen you you when the holy spirit comes
[1:30:38] it takes over your traditions
[1:30:41] and it doesn't make you a united states
[1:30:43] american marriage amen
[1:30:45] it makes you a marriage of the living
[1:30:48] god
[1:30:49] amen hallelujah praise the lord jesus
[1:30:52] because you wouldn't want a u.s of a
[1:30:54] marriage amen
[1:30:56] hallelujah but see god does it all
[1:31:00] because we come to him humbly
[1:31:03] but with boldness and that's what queen
[1:31:05] esther did and he goes i'll give you
[1:31:07] half of my kingdom well god's already
[1:31:09] said you got it all
[1:31:10] yeah amen when you have a need go in
[1:31:13] there
[1:31:14] like queen esther hallelujah and it's
[1:31:16] not that
[1:31:17] god may help you but he's already helped
[1:31:21] you
[1:31:21] he's already healed you he's already
[1:31:24] given you all the kingdom of god
[1:31:26] amen but but do we believe
[1:31:29] that what he said is already done it's
[1:31:32] already done
[1:31:33] amen the song is or whatever that is
[1:31:35] that's why i'm not a song leader
[1:31:36] amen i just put songs together my wife
[1:31:39] goes don't do that
[1:31:41] but he says it's already done i've
[1:31:43] already done i can't do anything more
[1:31:45] like brother bram says that jesus christ
[1:31:47] was here right now
[1:31:48] oh you go oh man i would believe well
[1:31:50] he's here amen
[1:31:52] he's all right you're here he's here
[1:31:54] right now praise the lord i'm sorry i'm
[1:31:56] yelling so much but
[1:31:57] isaiah 54 16
[1:32:00] through 55 and 2. behold
[1:32:04] i've created the smith that bloweth the
[1:32:06] coals in the fire
[1:32:08] and that bringeth forth an instrument of
[1:32:09] his work and i have created the waster
[1:32:12] to destroy
[1:32:13] amen who is who's allowing this it's the
[1:32:16] devil that's doing it god is eternal
[1:32:18] he's allowing the devil to do what he
[1:32:21] wants him to do
[1:32:25] he says and i have created the waster to
[1:32:28] destroy
[1:32:30] and this is my scripture during this
[1:32:32] time no
[1:32:33] weapon that is formed against thee shall
[1:32:35] prosper amen
[1:32:37] hallelujah and so it's according to your
[1:32:39] faith amen
[1:32:40] even if you got that thing hallelujah
[1:32:43] i'm not going to name it
[1:32:44] but even if you did you're already
[1:32:46] healed
[1:32:49] hallelujah no weapon nothing no spirit
[1:32:52] no demon formed against the bride
[1:32:54] will ever prosper amen you can't
[1:32:58] and every tongue that shall rise against
[1:33:00] thee in judgment thou shalt condemn
[1:33:02] let him let him just blah blah blah blah
[1:33:05] amen let the other versions of the
[1:33:08] message blah blah blah blah blah

[2:08:38] elias he goes to the murphy church and
[2:08:40] he was braver than i was
[2:08:42] he just walked up to him one day says
[2:08:44] you need to come to church with me
[2:08:45] so since then he's been sitting on the
[2:08:47] front row and he told me it's been
[2:08:48] amazing they're just preaching
[2:08:50] and he said uh it's just me it's me

[2:09:10] fitter and
[2:09:11] uh so the other day he comes up to me
