pleasure to take these needs before you because we have an absolute the word of god we know that if we call on you and ask lord anything in your name you said you would give it to us we're thankful

his family sister christian their daughter not feeling well father i just ask you for complete deliverance as we send your spirit through a word of healing to their bodies lord may chris go home and find them even well as we have spoken it lord if that is pleasing to you but regardless we know they've got to be made whole because we're asking for that and lord jesus we pray for this sister lord

that we can be here and we're expecting you to open your word lord not only just open it as we can open the bible but lord reveal it to our soul we pray now these things we ask in confidence because we have your word and we ask in the faith you've given us to ask in in jesus christ's name we pray amen amen well again god bless you and those who are joining us on the internet god bless you as well and may you feel his presence as we're feeling him here this evening and as we get ready to turn this service for our pastor let's certain to number 462 i feel like traveling on my heavenly home is bright and fair i feel like traveling on no pain or death and enter there i feel like traveling on well i feel like traveling on oh i feel like traveling on my heavenly home is bright and fair i feel like traveling [Music] heavenly mansion shall be my my heavenly hope is bright and fair he like traveling on the lord has been so good to me be like traveling on oh i feel like traveling on i heavily hope it's bright and fair feel like traveling on well i feel like traveling and that's the truth amen i look around in the world that we live in today and uh you know we just realized you know when the word of god showed us this was not our world it was not who we are it's becoming more plain clearer every single day amen do we we look at this and i won't go into all the thoughts that are jumbling through my head tonight part of that's just not beneficial in one sense because they have a lot of human uh you know things mixed with that you know what i mean as as you look at that and and so it's not beneficial but i can just say just take a moment look in the religious world today and tell me it does not mirror what god said would happen look in the economic world today and see if that does not mirror what has been spoken and look at the nature of humanity are they not mirroring mirroring the prophecy and every bit of it is just falling right into place now as hard as our days might be i want you to catch this as hard as our days might be are we not mirroring what the word said the bride would be this is not an egotistical a proud but it might be bold the world wants us as christians to be downtrodden and woe unto us this bride my brother and sister she's recognizing who she is she's recognizing the authority that she's been given in her husband's name it was all i could do to just not read these quotes that sister jerry just showed me there in the choosing of a bride because it is it is so powerful amen that that the word is being spoken and and it is coming to pass and we get to see it you say but brother paul i have troubles yeah your flesh will be with you always praise the lord and if we're going to start looking at flesh i hope you brought a lot of hankies clean access because we're all going to get up and we're all going to sob about this and that and lost opportunities and this and that and oh we mentioned lost opportunities and this and that but we're not looking at the flesh we weren't called to look at the flesh we can't find anywhere in the word of god said look at your flesh other than to judge yourself by the word and we judge ourselves by the word and we find ourselves unworthy and he says no problem i've shed my blood for you isn't it a beautiful story i it never ceases to encourage me otherwise i would have given up a long time ago because well some of us are just problem prone you know you hear people say well i guess i'm just a klutz well praise the lord i might not be a klutz in the flesh as far as the agility and etc but in the flesh i'm a klutz you follow me but praise the lord i lift up my eyes and who do i see my blessed redeemer jesus christ coming for me with eyes wide open i see his glory and his spirit has fallen and we've received this great life oh thank you lord hallelujah age old proverb saints we just want to just uh go into that once again i i pray that by god's grace the book of proverbs has been a blessing to you now if you wonder why brother paul is maybe going to go forward and then he's going to turn around and go back i'm just kind of following what has been laid upon my heart as far as the proverbs we're not trying to hurry through it you know it actually is very good reading and you know uh been many a a little booklet many of uh a you know a encouragement written you know that uh you can take all 31 chapters you know read them as a monthly daily uh um you know reader what do i want to call that devotion and uh but you know it's just there's so much so much wisdom that's in here um let's just stand as we'll go in and i want to speak this morning trusting the lord to direct our steps we have taken this out of portion not necessarily the complete emphasis of what we are looking at but it is a portion of the scripture today and and we will look at that i want to read actually quite a few verses 1 through 18 so be patient with me please the preparations of the heart in man oh i'm sorry proverbs 16. proverbs 16. proverbs 16 1-18 the preparations of the heart in man and the answer of the tongue is from the lord all the ways of a man are clean in his own eyes but the lord weigheth the spirits commit thy works into the lord and thy thoughts shall be established you see my brother and sister sometimes there's just an effort that god requires of us and we we actually hear it preached quite a bit maybe not so much around the message but in the world of christendom that they just reverse that right there they say well if i think these good thoughts then i'll do this but you see god kind of expects us if he says toe the mark he wants you to toe the mark you can't say i'll toe the mark whenever i have an inspiration to toe the mark and it's kind of interesting while we don't believe in a works gospel that there's a tremendous amount of work that god asks us to do but we don't do it out of obligation we do it actually from our heart and that changes the whole equation when we feel like oh here's a rule i have to follow then that that never works out well but the heart says you know what if god wants me to do this then i i know that's just as it would be what i will do because he wants me to commit thy works unto the lord and thy thoughts shall be established the lord hath made all things for himself yea even the wicked for the day of evil everyone that is proud in heart is an abomination to the lord now i want to throw this out my brother and sister because you see in previous proverbs it says contention comes from pride and an angry reply comes from pride no wonder god doesn't look too highly on pride everyone that is proud in heart is an abomination to the lord though hand joint in hand he shall not be unpunished by mercy and truth iniquity is purged and by the fear of the lord men depart from evil when a man's ways please the lord he maketh even his enemies to be at peace with him better is a little with righteousness than great revenues without right a man's heart deviseth his way but the lord directeth his steps a divine sentence is in the lips of the king his mouth transgresses not in judgment a just weight and balance are the lords all the weights of the bag are his work it is an abomination to kings to commit wickedness for the throne is established by righteousness now i won't comment on this later i don't believe but i just want to make a comment right there it's an abomination to kings to commit with wickedness look at the rulers through the generations the present rulers the corruption that prevails no wonder god looks down upon this and it makes him sick because men consumed by greed and by power and by passions run afoul of every bit of the word of god my oh by the way your president attended mass righteous lips are the delight of kings and they love and they love him that speaketh right the wrath of a king is as messengers of death but a wise man will pacify it in the light of the king's countenance is life in the light of the king's countenance his life and his favor is as a cloud of the latter rain how much better is it to get wisdom than gold to get understanding rather to be chosen than silver the highway of the upright is to depart from evil he that keepeth his way preserveth his soul pride goeth before destruction and a haughty spirit before a fall heavenly father we just come tonight and ask you lord jesus just to be with each and every one who is not here tonight lord just whatever reasons there might be not feeling well circumstances uh working father wherever it might be lord we just ask for your holy spirit to meet them lord speak to them father how faithful you are i think of my brother sergey no doubt father maybe driving or somewhere far across the land but lord just knowing lord in my own life the experience of how you come and you're faithful lord wherever we're at wherever we're seeking you father you always meet us there and i say thank you lord ask you to speak to us tonight lord help us to overcome the weariness of our bodies lord the distractions of our minds father just to press into the word tonight we ask in the name of jesus christ amen you may be seated this chapter saints uh as i was um just studying this chapter just i don't know it just struck me in such a profound way all the little uh uh little things about it the the statement after statement and how to me they fit the day that we live in so strongly uh that you know it just seems like the wisdom of the ages is being poured out uh in this day once again for us for our benefit and i pray that this speaks to your heart uh as we go through the book of proverbs i pray it speaks to your heart just as strongly as it is speaking to mine and certainly encourage you just to go and start there in in chapter one as we are just kind of hitting highlights and as i said we might be jumping backwards in chapters uh just following what the lord has laid upon my heart as we look at this first verse tonight it says the preparations of the heart in man and the answer of the tongue is from the lord now if we go to james the fourth chapter we will see my brother and sister how that in the word of god it gives very much a clarity to us about where our preparations and the things of our life are grounded and here it is in james 4 13 go to now ye that say today or tomorrow we will go into such a city now i know that myself i make statements like this and i i try to uh remind myself to come back and quantify them in the proper way now i might have this right and i might have it wrong but if i remember correctly the prophet of god says 956 times through his messages that are recorded the lord willing so this is no small thought that he has encouraged us to quantify or to attach this to our thoughts our deeds our plans the lord willing so we'll look at this and you know many of us we have busy lives we have things and plans have already been made of what you will do tomorrow in fact i have plans when i get home from church tonight of what i want to do and and not nothing real deep or sophisticated i'm going to go sit down in the chair and i'm going to say sister jerry make me a cup of tea i've already sitting in the office thought i want a cup of tea before i go to bed so you know that we kind of make plans that way and we can take it for granted but i want you to catch the significance of this go to now ye that say today or tomorrow we will go into such a city and continue there a year and buy and sell and get gain whereas ye know not what shall be on the morrow we don't even know what tomorrow might be my brother and sister for what is your life it is even a vapor that appeareth for a little time then vanisheth away and so we see that literally as it is a good friend of mine a man who has treated me so kindly i pray god would uh bless him uh reward him for his kindness through the years of favors that he has done for us the man is lds 93 years old just passed away a gentleman of a man a man who would look at you and say paul you and i believe differently and then he would pause and he'd say but do we really and you'd say but he he's ldf so he yes he believes different but his life spoke a different chapter a different volume it spoke a different language and so you look at this and realize this man had met god somewhere in his life because he was this just absolute gem of a man i i don't know if i should put the word saint to him but if you would have met him in life you'd have said this man is just a tremendous man and you know you look at that and you just don't realize you know how it is and i realized how many years i have known this gentleman uh it was 30 plus years and i can say that for 30 plus years he would look at me and say is there something i can do for you and so you realize that but i can guarantee you when my friend passed away he was thinking my life has been nothing but a vapor are you with me that's why sometimes us older people go out and we try to kick a ball and hit a ball and then we get up the next morning and go oh my goodness who beat me because our mind is still locked in at 17 18 19 20 whatever it might be and so the vapor my brother and sister is apparent even here while we're living and that appeareth for a little time and then vanisheth away for that ye ought to say if the lord will we'll all be alive in the morning if the lord will we shall live and do this or that i believe it's a principle that we ought to embrace wholeheartedly amen you know the prophet of god i've always took this as a little special touch for me sorry if if you maybe don't see the depth i take it but the prophet of god said you know just keep on planting your potatoes and he actually spoke highly of farmers amen thank you lord but you look at this and realize that that in this whole context we make plans for days week months and years in front of us and yet we have no control of whether we will even finish this day at the stroke of midnight but we realize that by god's grace and mercy he knows every breath every bat of our eye every step that we will take every circumstance that surrounds our life and he has it figured out i say i'm glad i'm in his hands amen so we can trust the lord but my brother and sister don't give up keep making the plans amen if not well let me just put this in here like this we have some very dear friends that live in the east and you know they got caught up in certain doctrines and different things for a a pretty good chunk of their life and here they are older now and have little or no retirement and so it's there in a thing like that that they didn't actually take the scriptural balance that says that we would be good stewards and we would uh make preparation and we would do these things see so just because you are living and believing the rapture is in the morning doesn't stop you from making a good solid plan for your fruit future amen because uh no one thought hey look when i was a kid growing up in church i i i never thought i would get married i i never thought that i and i got married and then i never thought we would have children we have children i never thought my children would grow up and get married i never thought my children would have children and you see so it just keeps going and so you you plan for the rapture you plan for the coming of the lord if i was to fall over dead right now i don't want that that to be some ending of my plan because the master plan come from the master and we read the plan and we realize what our true plan is it is not about gaining wealth and this and that or whatever but it's to be prepared to please him amen and to live that kind of a life that is pleasing to him at the moment amen so the preparations of the heart in man and the answer of the tongue is from the lord and i say let it become part of our speech the lord willing amen all the ways of a man are clean in his own eyes but the lord weigheth the spirits you know this is a very interesting portion coupled with verse 3 commit thy works into the lord and thy thoughts shall be established and you know we find ourselves my brother and sister looking at our own plans i always jokingly and i certainly don't say it uh in slight of at all but uh you know just the old song justified justified just as if i'd never done it i'm justified you realize you can be caught so much in carnality and still maintain that kind of mental thought it's not my fault i didn't do it it's your fault it's my wife's fault it's my husband's fault it's my children it's my parents it's the preacher it's the church we're justified but you see what we're looking for my brother and sister is to be truly justified by the word of god and to come into that position you see it's not just an action that we take see we can put things down to actions hey uh i i basically repented uh and i got baptized so everything's fine but my brother and sister you go back through the scripture there there is you might say this is just phraseology a thousand things that god asks us to do and so people want to know oh can can you you know be saved and go to heaven if you've never been baptized not if you know different and refuse to do it they justify it well it says just believe no but it also gives you what the context that's it good way to put it brother david the context of what to believe amen and so the word says something god says you know it now be obedient to it so i want you to look right here we heard the prophet of god say this so many times you know he said check your motive and your objective why do i want to do what i want to do now let me put it in a silly fashion if i may you never saw a child sneak to the fridge to get celery cauliflower and broccoli and you never saw a child sneak to the cookie jar to get a burnt chocolate chip cookie doesn't happen does it the motive for sneaking the cookie is because the cookie tastes good and i want it and i'm slightly rebellious to my mom and dad well there has to be a slight motive of rebellion there or we would be obedient when mom and dad says you're not eating a cookie till after supper and you already know the rules you don't get to eat dessert unless you cleaned up your plate and there's going to be broccoli on the plate and that makes it almost impossible to clean up the plate unless you have a dog named teddy that will eat anything so our motive and our objective as sons and daughters of god is our desire to do the lord's will there is the measurement of sons and daughters of god our motive and our objective it can be summed up not encapsulated but summed up in the simple words our desire to do the lord's will we want to please him we are not here to just take and cherry pick and sneak what portions we want and ignore the rest but we take all that god has given to us and we lay claim to it can we agree with that tonight amen some of it's not simple some of it's not easy the word said it might be sweet in your mouth and bitter in your belly but there's a desire down inside of you that says if god wants me to eat this portion of the scripture now let me just be real open and honest with you because i think it will apply to some of you maybe you opened your bible and you're starting to read some scripture and it's kind of like ouch maybe it's your bedtime scripture and you're like oh you know i was just thinking about reading in the psalms come on do you know what i'm saying come on we've done that uh we've done that i won't go into this story but anyway uh i i can just tell you in the last few days i had a little back story picking up my bible starting to read and going i'm very uncomfortable reading this why because it dealt straight to my heart it didn't hit my intellect it wasn't something about you the word called my name even though you won't find it in print the word called my name and says i'm speaking to you can you se have you experienced that amen and so what is it it's god coming down in a personal way to deal with us that we can keep our desire our motive and our objective in line amen because we are sheep right are we not typed as sheep and sheep are prone to do what wander it's a wonder they don't wander more amen hallelujah you know if we realize that now pardon me for putting this way lord i'm not making light but you know uh my brother and sister are those great big dogs that are with the sheep sister jerry and i was going to town the other day and and there must have been oh my there was thousands i don't want to exaggerate but there was thousands of sheep on the highway there they were we were way back up the road and they were out of sight crossing the dam just the road packed wall-to-wall with sheep now my brother and sister those great big dogs that are there they they are there to protect the sheep but did you know that they also have a herd instinct in them and the sheep are just fine and the dog is something they can ignore until they get out of line amen and so it's there that we realize the holy spirit would be as it were a great pyrenees to us it's here to protect us but he's also there that when we wander out of line that he's going to let us know we belong back over here so you get back with the with the herd as it were with the flock amen now brother branham says in the message testimony he said i'm not a preacher now i'll tell you what i just say this is a side note if he wasn't a preacher the rest of us never qualified we don't we don't even use the word amen hallelujah i don't believe it was a false humility i just believe god knew how to keep him humble kept him down to where he knew it wasn't anything about him it was all about the word of god and that he would have draw a giant blank if god didn't deal with him right even when he comes to opening of the seals and and speaking of the horse riders and these things he says now this was my idea and this is what i thought and this is how i saw it so the holy spirit come down and dealt with him and he knew that without the holy spirit dealing with him he would have kind of just sided with those teachers that seem to make the most sense or seem to be the most anointed and you know you and i are the same way we can look at the word of god draw a conclusion and then be studying uh hearing uh and realize my conclusion was not entirely accurate so he's saying i'm not a preacher anybody knows that well we're not just anybody i'm not a preacher but it's made up in a spiritual form of watching things and seeing things move and forewarning people of things that's coming to pass and it's just that's my makeup so he didn't go out and form himself right he couldn't form himself into the office god had to mold them god made them now i want to apply that back to you and i my brother and sister we are not made by human human hands or humanity's form into the image of god into the image of a holy ghost-filled christian it is god forming you amen i i made a statement uh i read you know my typical thing i read something i can't remember it and i tried to repeat it to to brother jason in the back there uh that my brother and sister it is of the forming of our character it's the hard trials it's a struggle of the day i believe is how the phrase went the struggle of the day is what forms i want you to think about that but i had a really easy day but your yesterday might not and your tomorrow might not but you see god is forming us and just like anything that's being formed if you take a raw iron and just try and mash it into a form it won't happen you got to get the impurities out first and then you've got to get all the circumstance that surrounds it correct before you conform it into what it needs to be formed into and i like to use steel or aluminum something of that nature as an example because for it to become malleable and formable it has to be put under heat and pressure hallelujah in that incredible who wants their character formed yeah you know what but that's not your flesh that says i want my character for that is god in you because a human element i was listening to a a a minister uh and and it broke my heart to hear this man he's a young man of uh uh probably mid thirties uh and he's standing he's a pastor of a church he's standing before them and he's apologizing to the church for the fact that one their church is predominantly white and he's apologizing to the church that he is white and therefore he is part of the problem oh this whole race thing is just getting crazy crazy crazy i'll tell you what the problem is saints we're not washed by the water of the word we're not washed by the blood of jesus christ we have not repented we have not been baptized and filled with the holy ghost it does not matter what color we are god formed us and placed us because that was god's desire the problem is humanity has forsaken god and left the holy ghost as some two words on a page somewhere when we should be seeking the very presence of almighty god and i can tell you from my heart i know it's clear i don't even mean to go here but i'll just say this i have become colorblind hallelujah i'm looking at sons and daughters of god i'm not looking at where they came from or what they have it's not that we got this and we got that my brother and sister we are sons and daughters of god we stand on the word of god and the word of god the same spirit that raised christ from the dead the word says is in you and i today and if we have that spirit in us we can't be nothing but saying this is my brother this is my sister without a quantifier but we live in a world that's woke that's the term they're using woke well i'll tell you what they're waking up to they're waking up to an antichrist spirit that tells them one thing and maneuvers them in another that's the spirit of the day tell you one thing and then move in an opposite fashion amen so he says that's my makeup i can't help that no more than you can help your makeup amen right you couldn't be born anything else we don't need to apologize for who we are we need to be filled with the holy ghost there'll be no human apology when we are filled with the holy ghost hallelujah amen god has put us each one come on are we on this together each one that means everyone tonight anyone listening each one in the body to do certain things and i watch every little move every objective every motive because everything is governed by governed by spirit look at this and we're called to be in spirit and in truth right but the devils come in to get a spirit inside the church right now the prophet of god makes this statement he says you know you know and i put it this isn't perfect words but you know he said be careful you don't get the spirit of the pastor come on we're not here to get the spirit of the pastor we're not here now look brother brown deals with this let me just go on amen governed by spirit this church was put here for a purpose there is a spirit behind this church let's not look back and say oh where was i preached that let's look right here there's a spirit behind this church and that spirit will either pull us into the presence of god or isolate us from it see having a form of godliness but denying the power thereof you might as well be an atheist for all it will do for us there's a spirit behind this church certainly spirit behind your home that's right well it tasted real sweet a minute ago kind of getting a little tougher now isn't it behind every building behind everything there is a spirit a motive no a in there spirit motive and objective this church comes here to greatly exalt some human system or something then its motives is not right but if it's put here to try to achieve something for the kingdom of god then the motive and objective both is right if the motive is directed that way amen my brother and sister the moment oh no moment we ever come under the influence to start putting people on pedestals somebody bring a chainsaw to church we're cutting that pedestal up this is nothing about a humanity it's nothing about any important or great person it's about jesus christ period amen hallelujah so i love that spirit behind this church god help us that the spirit behind this church will always be christ first amen and not in name only right not just an identifier to throw out but the very life the very nature the very character of christ in us hallelujah i i really enjoyed that quote when i come across it see verse 4 says the lord had made all things for himself in that wonderful how we can just stop kind of cut that sentence off right there and and not really go back into that you know because uh hey look he has made all things for himself but my brother and sister i want you to look at this at that point we're going to stop now what's that called that's called a colon right the lord hath made all things for himself we were made for him he was not made for us we were made for him right so the whole plan of god was laid out from before the foundation of the world aren't you glad your name was in the book he wrote it with his own precious blood identified it pointed it out to you and i that we can stand here tonight and say thank you lord i see myself in the plan of god and so we look at that the lord hath made all things for himself yey even the wicked that's right it's it's you know we read it and i'm afraid saints that we just kind of okay but i want you to understand everything out here can be one of two things it can be a trap for you or it can be a benefit to you what this wicked world be a benefit to me absolutely because as a son or daughter of god identified by the word right that's not a vague thing very direct can we say it's very direct we know god was speaking to us it wasn't random it wasn't you know kind of like somebody's pointing i right here sister nadia doesn't know if i'm pointing at her or brother chris nothing more embarrassing when somebody's like come here and you get up and realize they weren't talking to me but the word isn't that way the word says that he would save everyone so you read it in that fashion everyone thinks they're saved but he was actually pointing to the bride and the bride recognizes that she was the one he was calling to amen oh i i hope you catch the depth of that the rest say i think he was sorry sister nadia to pick on you i don't mean it that way but you see my brother and sister some think they were being called but it wasn't them so they take john 3 16 as the fundamental basic value that we're all saved all we have to do is believe on the lord we're all saved but my brother and sister they missed the point they missed the point that the word of god was so specific god didn't shoot you know it's like the cartoons of cupid i used to have this i still got a little plaque from when i was a teenager it's got this funky looking little princess on it and uh i used to tell everybody this is this is the girl i'm gonna marry and uh uh i don't know yeah close but i also used to have a cartoon of cupid and he's got an arrow and you can see it in the bow and you think it first it's just the cartoon that the arrow has a bend in it and he lets go and the arrow goes misses the pretty girl flies over the bush and strikes grandmother and the next pitcher is grandmother holding on to the young man i used to think that was so funny god doesn't miss what's in your heart tonight was direct from the throne of god to you not an arrow that wandered away but a direct call to you and i you see i think we forget that sometimes maybe i'm misguided forgive me if i am but i think we miss that sometimes because we start to doubt and we start to feel like somehow we're inadequate and we can't and we this and we that to realize god chose you he says in his word that he's already made the way before you he's provided everything necessary i don't care how your day was good bad or indifferent we should stand up and say praise the lord i'm a son of god i'm a daughter of god it don't matter that this whole world is falling apart and burning down i'll stand on that promise and that promise right there hallelujah because otherwise the devil just keeps pounding away on you my brother and sister amen and pretty soon you know you just give up and people say well i guess i wasn't a christian only to go for 20 25 years in a miserable life i can introduce you to these people miserable life and 23 and a half years later they're like i'm so tired i think i'll just kill myself and god comes and speaks to them in the night and says why don't you just come back to me you want peace i have peace you want comfort i have comfort you want life i am life and they come back and say why did i do what i did well because the devil got in there and you say well maybe that was the will of god maybe it was permissible will amen the perfect will of god was their name was on the book you will redeem them hallelujah sorry i'm getting distracted amen so he's even made the wicked my brother and sister for this day and it's hard right because some of these wicked people are very nice and extremely wicked i painted a house for a lady one time that grew up in a cult in california and she started telling me she was uh made me a little nervous i'm trying to finish painting inside of her house and she followed me from room to room until i finally said oh i remember i have to go somewhere else and work today because it was just creepy but she started talking about her childhood and she said is about 13 14 years old it culminated when literally she witnessed them murder a baby for the ritual and something inside of her says this is wrong she ran away from home gotten a lot of other problems we won't go into that to one day she's in a mission and the mission their their objective was to point people to jesus christ and she got introduced to jesus christ and you know i tried to introduce her to the other version you might say of jesus christ but she was content with the version she had but you see my brother and sister there's lots of nice people they're very wicked she said one of those wicked people that was involved was the mayor of their city such a nice guy everybody liked him stories like that never leave you you realize that the front doesn't have to reflect the back amen that's why the word calls for you and i to live such a life transparent a life that what they see is what they get and when they look they don't see humanity they see jesus christ and it doesn't matter if we're coming or going or from right or for the left they still see jesus christ amen let me hurry along i'm getting lost in my thoughts everyone that is proud in the heart is an abomination to the lord you know we look at that i'm not going to expound on that tonight but my brother and sister you know you see these things when we see ourself in our position we'll also see that those that were made for this day to fulfill the unbeliever the make believer they were made for that just like you were made to be the bride of christ amen now look at verse seven i want to come oh no verse six i mean uh by mercy and truth iniquity is purge see it's not by intellectualism right god's mercy and the truth iniquity is pursed and remember the prophet brought that right down simple you know to do it right you know what to do and you don't do it it's iniquity amen so by god's mercy and hearing the truth uh causes us my brother and sister you know someone might say well i did this and this and and that's behind me now but i i never made that right but i know who to go to i know who to apologize to don't don't just put that to the side you take care of that you say well i'd be ashamed to go and you know stand on somebody's step or tell them i did this and this and i'm sorry but my brother and sister you're not necessarily dealing with that person it's between you and god and so what you want to do regardless of what they think about you they might think that you are just loony that doesn't matter when you get that off of your chest and you know the next time the devil tries to get you to put that under the rug you've now got a foundation a precedent they call it to look at that and say no i'm going to deal with it and where we once ran from our problems now we stand and deal with it and people say how can you do that i do that because i know that god will call me right back here again to this very same point again so i'm just going to stand and deal with it come on by witness i testify amen so we look at this when a man's ways please the lord he maketh even his enemies to be at peace with him what a position to be in oh my my brother and sister now look we can we can kind of get caught up in this and i only bring it this way just to stir your mind you see while it would be reversed as a statement right when a man's ways please the lord seems like that's the break he maketh even his enemies to be at peace with him but let me let me put this out to you this way don't focus on the enemy don't focus on the person that hurts you don't focus on what you see as the perceived wrong come on for the word says that when we please god it makes the enemy not when we vanquished the enemy but when we've proven them wrong when we proved we're superior or prove that they had some no no it's when we please the lord when we come to the place that we are pleasing to the lord he will by his word bring the enemy around even to say i'm sorry the very thing that maybe made them an enemy in the beginning but let me put it this way also if they never ever come around you'll find that your desire motive objective to please god becomes a salve to your own soul comes a slave to your own heart your own mind that you come to the place that there's no animosities there's no angst there's nothing there you can see them and the very vision of them natural vision of them causes your heart to say god help them amen not like if i could get them behind the building i'd talk to them i'd remind them no you see that's our problem not their problem god used them to reveal your fault now i'm not preaching to you i'm preaching to people like you every one of us will at some time in our life face that where we look and our feelings rise up that person that person said this that person did this but i can assure you that when god deals and you see that person it doesn't god didn't say he'd erase your memory right that person hurts you but you know you've been delivered when you see them and you say oh god help that's the truth lord touch them bring them to the cross lord bring them into change their life you see the wisdom that god uses he sometimes lets us fight against the harness let me put this we don't have any certain timeline to meet tonight so we can stop whenever we want here let me just share this many years ago we knew this old rancher is all broke up now but him and his children him and his brother and their children controlled several hundred thousand acres of the owahis going off south of bruno out into the nevada desert an incredible chunk of land that at one point in time they they owned and controlled and they had cattle that sometimes would be missed and they might live out there you know wild as wild for a couple years and they had this aux a real genuine aux you know had one gear that was slow and they would rope these steers and they would tie those steers to this aux this ox loved home they didn't try to drag that steer they didn't fight with him they might be 15 20 miles away from the headquarters they would just rope that steer and tie him to the ox and then they just let the ox go one time they shared the story about how they thought maybe the ox something bad had happened because it was like two weeks and he still hadn't showed up and they just rode out of the ranch to go look for him and top to rise and they knew the value of their ox when here he comes and here's his steer still fighting two weeks of fighting and the ox just one step in front of the other because he knew i'm going home and he drug that steer in the corral and of course you have to understand this family i won't mention names the dad said we'll never break this deer and they ate him but the thing was the ox knew where home was and nothing oh i hope you get this nothing was stopping him from going home even though he was tied to this world to the spirit of laodicea it fought him every inch of the way was opposed to everything he wanted to do he still knew where home was and he kept going but their success stories they had many many many of us steer by the time that old aux drug him into the corral they could just go up there and take the ropes off of him because they were thoroughly broken so let me throw this another angle my brother and sister tonight sister amy if you would just come we can either come easy or we can come hard but if we belong to the lord we will come we might come tied as it were to the ox of the word amen we might realize that you know after a while this is not worth fighting i'll just serve him i'll just walk with him amen hallelujah when a man's ways please the lord he maketh even his enemies to be at peace with him amen well look i want to just stop right there even though i just barely scratched but i want to just feel led to do this my brother and sister no matter what our problems are be they in the family be it in the church be it at work be it a neighbor don't look at the enemy stay focused on pleasing the lord because you see if the devil can put someone in the way they will promote them now the word of god shows us very clearly and the prophet of god elaborates on this that if the devil can't [Music] just directly affect the church he'll bring them in raise him up he'll do whatever he can to do that but you see this is not about oh can i just kind of make this real personal it's not about the relationship i have with brother trevor you know brother trevor does things that i don't like and i don't even want to be around him he just he's way too happy annoying it annoys me that he's happy and um you know i put up with him because i believe the message is the truth and i want to go to church here [Music] but i don't really like him [Music] you know without intervention that won't get any better [Music] but with the wrong intervention it can get much worse amen prophet talks about this says the devil put a spirit on someone now because i definitely don't want this to come out wrong i've now got a spirit on me and my dislike for brother trevor's happiness is starting to sprout a little bitterness [Music] and my bitterness that causes me not to come to church because trevor is going to be there this bitterness that causes me not to go to fellowships because trevor is going to be there this bitterness that causes me not to go to a birthday party because brother trevor is going to be there [Music] who's it hurting [Music] you see brother trevor might not even know i feel that way because [Music] god bless you brother [Music] come on saints brother trevor might think everything's all right who's dying i am [Music] but if we have the courage to say you know what i recognize that what's on me i rather traverse personality whatever i i just the hardest thing we do sometimes you know saying some of the hardest things we do lord forgive me lord forgive me it isn't about brother trevor it's about you and me lord and when we get that opened up and we get that all fixed oh it's a lovely story i won't go into it takes too much time oh hallelujah i got to give you enough so you understand what i'm saying this man got real bitter got real angry god dealt with him and he went down to the church one night and just prayed and prayed and prayed until the lord delivered him and he went to church and next sunday and he's sitting in church and he sees this person he's been bitter to and he goes oh praise the lord while the lord was dealing with me he fixed him too [Music] come on saints no root of bitterness no blaming anyone else let's just stand and say you know what this is about me and the lord and if i think brother trevor you know just close this out make sure y'all are on the same page if i think brother trevor has a problem if i don't i don't approach it correct i will make what wasn't a problem into a problem and then it turns out when god deals with me brother trevor suddenly looks so well and i think oh my i love this brother i just love being around him praise the lord he's so much fun and the whole time it had nothing to do because the devil got in there and you know what happens we've seen it i've seen it there's people that have gone to this church and no longer in this church started out they had a little gripe here then it moved and graduated to a gripe here and graduated to a gripe over here and then gripe over here and cry over there what was it they fed that spirit instead of stopping and saying lord they have faults i have faults lord help me lord help them lord forgive me forgive them and then the isms and seasons i can take you quotes if we need them do we do we need them i can look them up it might take me 30-40 minutes but you guys have time let's not become those people that find ourselves fighting against the will of god let's find ourselves placing a value of revelation of wisdom over prosperity over gold and silver let's find ourselves in that position where being pleasing to god is more important than anything else in our life hallelujah amen you know i think the lord just knew i just asked him brother jason about a couple songs before the service and this i think is the lord just letting us come to the place amen let's sing that song pleasing it just was on my heart today amen i wanted to sing at the close of the other 45 minutes of my servant amen but you know what saints let's just focus let's focus somebody at work is a problem focus on pleasing the lord not focusing on them not focusing on the company not focusing on anything else focus on pleasing the lord and when we focus on pleasing the lord suddenly something spills over and god answers prayers and god changes circumstances and changes people's attitudes and usually ours is first [Music] let's just be pleasing to the lord let's let's let's let our whole life our whole focus let it be judged lord what is my motive what is my objective what the prophet of god saying that we could do something for the kingdom of god when we put that as our priority to do something for the kingdom and we lower ourselves down just a little bit that pride no longer has value reminds me one time i well i'll just say where i was at it doesn't really matter i was in chibak alaska i tell you you should all go there it will be an experience that you will never ever forget the lord laid on my heart in the service during chivac the anointing of the lord come down very very strong in their little church and i shifted over and i started preaching on the value of pride i took this angle i was looking today on the stock market and the value of pride is plunging in fact it bottomed out in the market there was zero value of pride i didn't realize i didn't know these folks brother david's been there he knows what i'm talking about i didn't know these folks brother chris he knows these people i i didn't really know him that well and i didn't realize people filled the altars and weeping crying but there was one older gentleman he sat in the back with his arms crossed and just stared me down and i thought well lord i didn't maybe come here to preach to that man when the service was all over people were done crying out to the lord lives being touched whatever it was that was in their life [Music] we were leaving that man met me outside the door to let me know he disagreed with me [Music] and the hat he was wearing said native pride [Music] and he let me know he was proud to be [Music] praise the lord let my pride lord be in you there be something the prophet of god says that we can boast about let it be jesus christ hallelujah oh my forgive me for just kind of wandering around tonight that's what was on my heart just want to encourage you don't focus on the enemy focus on our lord jesus amen let's just brother jason please come let's sing this song pleasing amen hallelujah let everything that i do be pleasing to you o praying that everything i pursue be pleasing oh lord unto you let's stand and sing it again oh please everything that i do be pleasing to you oh praying let everything i pursue be pleasing oh lord unto you amen let's turn to 973. paul asks food sing this tonight i get
