[Music] brother Gideon put up verse 4 please amen sometimes God just allows you you know the struggle just a little bit on what you should preach and you have thoughts and then you don't feel like that's the thought and then God comes along and says I'll show you that it's the thought to this I hope my shepherd will defend through the deepest valley he will leave all the night has been one and I shall overcome yet not I uh through Christ on me let's sing it one more time do this I hold my shepherd will defend me through the deepest valley he will leave [Music] but through Christ I have a couple things I want to share but on that thought there I want to share my title today in my defense [Music] Hallelujah disturbs my heart God would lead the songs to lead us right to the very thought in my defense when I could not defend myself when I thought I had answers and found my answers were wrong he come in my defense can someone lift a hand and say thank you Lord in a world we can't defend ourselves in let's face it Saints we cannot defend ourself but he has come Our Shepherd and is here defending us thank you Lord amen you may be seated for just a moment amen I want to start by uh announcing and I will I will just kill this name so you guys will just have to forgive me but uh brother Vitale sokolov how do you say that is that close enough okay our brother Vitali and family are going to be arriving uh here I believe it's the evening of August the 8th quite late will be with us Lord willing we'll be speaking for us on uh Wednesday night and then we have the church what yes yes praise the Lord and uh and to those of you that won't be at the campout uh I I just I'm gonna let you know right now just put it right up front to you you're going to miss an incredible time so I would just encourage everyone that can make it to the campout it's not that far up the mountain the roads are good uh just come uh brother Vitale's going to do some devotions for us do a Sunday morning devotion for us and and uh this is actually supposed to be vacation for him but uh anyway um we're we're actually giving a much more vacation than brother Eugene is because brother Eugene's gone in preaching Family Camp uh for his vacation and then brother Chad is giving him some more vacation for a weekend of preaching and uh so we want to be the ones that give that but he will be ministering Lord willing uh Wednesday uh and uh so uh remember Saints share it with one another come camp out come sleep on the Rocks eat burnt hot dogs just come have fun amen and so also I want to announce that I don't have a definitive date here but Brother David Nash and I have been collaborating on having our brother Stan price from Florida we'll be coming out him and his wife have never been West and so uh he's going to come spend a little time with Brother David I think preaching the Tri-Cities and I do believe if our plans are are solidified that he will be here to preach for us at the end of that time which would be somewhere around that weekend of the 19th or 20th of August and I don't know if you're familiar with brother Stan just a stable brother pastors at church been around for many years seen the shaking of the heavens and the Earth seen all of these things and yet still standing solid on the word got a lovely group of Believers there in Florida so we want to uh just be in prayer for both of those times and um it just uh I think be a real blessing to us amen and so we want to be in prayer for those that are out we have a lot of brothers and sisters not here this morning for various reasons uh and uh we just want uh the Lord to just come move in their presence amen and remember it's good therapy if we believe in therapy some people say I don't believe in therapy but I believe in therapy the Holy Ghost comes down starts to deal with our heart and the therapy that happens we in a time of anxiety find peace in the find of trouble we find security in these things this is a therapy the prophet of God showed us he says when you have these needs prayer is our answer amen thank you Lord for that Hallelujah don't even have to make an appointment isn't that awesome you can just Anytime Anyplace whether it's freeway traffic or whether you're in the middle of the field and the wheels have fallen off the wagon you can just stop and do that and once again uh let's remember our sister April I think we kind of left her out of the prayer request right there but um I think she's up to be with her nephews for um Camp um at Living Word and uh my house she loves those nephews amen I I just uh she just loves those nephews that's all I think I need to say so remember her she desired to be here but she also desired to be there with with the family and once again um we just want to um welcome brother Jeremy sister Emily and sister Emily well I can sound all gushy and mushy I used to think of her as a extended daughter you know like you can reach out and just adopt someone out of a family like whether they like it or not and um but anyway we have just such uh fond and loving memories of our sister Emily always liked her a little bit feisty and she can shoot a gun and uh brother Jeremy I only met him once but we had a lovely time a little Fellowship in a restaurant there in Calgary and uh I don't know which one of you got the best into that deal but I think God knew what he was doing so amen let's just stand and go into the word I don't know our brother Logan maybe stepped out or something but we just definitely want to greet him also let's turn in Psalm the 62nd chapter verses 1 through 12 and uh we just want to take our thought from this that God would just bless us with his word today you know my brother and sister it's always good you know I just um you have little things that anchor in your soul so in high school I was just this runty scrunt scrawny kid and um uh actually there's proof that there is uh uh Evolution metamorphosis I went from this scrawny scrawny kid to well anyway um but you know I had a friend named Randy and Randy was great big guy great great big guy hands like dinner plates went on to play at the highest level of college football and was very successful at that and uh Randy being my friend you know and kids would pick on me at school there would be as the proverbial cartoon has it the shadow that overwhelms everything comes over the scene and I didn't stand there in fear because I knew my friend Randy was there to defend me and so in the world we live in today Satan will like nothing more than you and I to live in the shadow of fear a shadow of anxiety a shadow of uncertainty by brother and sister but the shadow that we are in according to the word of God is the shadow of the wings of our Lord Jesus Christ amen and as we are here by being Sons and Daughters of God this Grand privilege that has been given to us amen my brother sister not obligation we'll touch on this a little later some people feel like serving God is obligation I view it and I trust that you view it as privilege amen that God says you know I chose you and and that's a grand privilege that we have been given amen and so we just want to look at this thought today amen truly my soul waiteth upon God from him cometh my salvation he only is my rock and my salvation he is my defense I shall not be greatly moved how long will ye imagine Mischief against a man ye shall be slain all of you as a Boeing wall shall ye be and as a tauntering fence no security either one of those amen they only consult to cast him down from his Excellency they Delight in lies they bless with their mouth but curse inwardly my soul wait thou only upon God now my brother and sister I want us to just take this if I could just throw this in right now so I don't have to come back amen speak to your soul amen the song says speak to the Rock Amen the word says abort upon your confession or profession of Faith so speak to your soul don't let your soul waver but speak to your soul and tell your soul amen amen let your soul know what your desire is and let it respond and when you're speaking these words you say can I change my soul well your soul has a seed in it and the expression of that seed my brother and sister can be influenced you say but I'm predestinated there's still influence go listen to influences I just studying influences as you go go there's influences there let me just throw a natural type sorry to keep you standing but my brother and sister I have a farm that we farm and along that is a giant row of trees and a very same fertilizer the same water the same seed is planted but the corn that is in the shadow or the beans or the wheat that's in the shadow of those trees never grows like it does in the sunlight it always you can watch it taper away of the length of the Shadow so I'm making this point to tell you that the light in the evening time because that's when the shadow comes upon this corn is important you can't just say we got the light my brother and sister it's light in the evening time that brings maturity thank you Lord yes my soul wait thou only upon God for my expectation is from him he only is my rock and my salvation he is my defense I shall not be moved and God is my salvation and my glory the rock of my strength and my refuge is in God trust in him at all times ye people pour out your heart before him God is a refuge for us see law surely men of low degree or vanity and Men of high degree are a lie to be laid in the balance they are altogether lighter than vanity trust not in oppression and become not vain in robbery if riches increase set not your heart upon them now it's not saying if you have riches that you are going to fail it's when our heart is set upon those riches if our heart is just on God Amen brother Jake and I just had this conversation he was wondering whether to go on down the road because he has an appointment to deliver and I loved it my heart stirred when he texted me back and said every time I put God first everything works out fine and so here he is with us this morning in church amen so you look at that my brother and sister that how God is there but become not in oppression and become not in vain robbery if Rich is increased setting out your heart upon them God hath spoken once twice have I heard this that power belongeth unto God also unto thee O Lord belongeth Mercy for thou rindereth to every man according to his work Heavenly Father we ask for your blessings today lead us guide us father speak to our hearts Lord may we find Liberty today and be able to just walk out saying truly it was good to be in the house of the Lord today we thank you in your precious name amen you may be seated Saints as we look upon this today my brother and sister I just look and as I was studying this and and uh looking through the whole picture you might say realize that we can claim a lot of things we can claim to be the greatest revelated or have more Revelation accumulated you might say or revealed than ever through history but my brother and sister if we are here with all of this open revealed word the book is open amen and we're here with all of this but we find ourselves defenseless then the enemy would just come as it would be and roll across the land again and again and again and we would just be as it were shamgar before Revelation shrunk him and so as it is to be defenseless in this day is also to say that you are going to be without victory if you have no defense against the spirit of laodicea then the spirit of laodicea will soon consume us just a little portion at a time it will come it will take away our confidence it will take away amen our Victory now there is ups and downs in life I think we could all say Amen to that there's life is not easy we are here with a word that God revealed in this hour through a prophet and in this realm we're seeing here that didn't suddenly make everything in this life easy Amen in fact sometimes because of our heart's desire to live the word we'll find ourselves almost in a constant battle in the world that we live in because there is all this influence around us all this wickedness around us that we have to face amen and so it's there that in these ups and downs of life it is a seeming a constant turmoil now my brother and sister we have to understand that what is happening around us does not define who we are and so when we talk about chaos and uncertainties and anxieties and all of these things of doubts and fears that's not who the bride of Christ is amen she is in a whole separate atmosphere but that atmosphere is influenced by this present world that we live in and so while there's constant turmoil if you don't think so I like to look at the news on the computer her every morning I usually just look for a moment to just kind of see and if we took what was in the news every single morning we would need to be in on some kind of anti-anxiety or some kind of medicine to to just calm our poor Hearts amen the word says that we're coming in a time that men's hearts are failing for fear and there is a underlying root of what is the uncertainty of tomorrow and I remember just watching a deal recently about Israel and they're interviewing people there in Israel and my brother and sister we're seeing even in that realm a dividing taking place you'll see that there are some that are standing there and they've experienced all kinds of experiences and they're saying oh no we fear for the state of Israel we fear for these people and we fear for our children's future but then you'll talk to another one and they will be there and they'll make a declaration you realize they've had some influence from you might say uh Christianity and they will stand there and say no God's in control no one can do anything to us but what God has it in his plan there's no terrorists there's no bombs there's no invasions there's nothing but what God has been aware of it from the beginning and so you'll see a divide where people in an uncertainty are almost afraid to leave their homes that something will happen and others who are looking and declaring my God's in control amen now this morning we get to decide which one of those we claim we can decide God's in control or we can be afraid of where the direction of our government is going and they're going to do this and they're going to do that and they're going to take this Liberty and they're going to take that Liberty well in this flesh we will see the government try to take or it will take a many things from the citizens as it were and you being a Christian a real Christian amen they never did mind the lukewarm amen they didn't mind the cold Christian at all but you being a real Christian you will be targeted but my brother and sister the word has already declared to you and I that we are not here to buy gold and bury it in the backyard we're not here to buy ammunition and bury it in the backyard we're not here to put up two or three or ten years supply of food in the backyard what we are here is to completely surrender to our King who said I am your defense I am the one who is going to take care of you because my brother and sister there's no amount of food amen the rats will find it somebody will find it it'll spoil whatever it might be your gold amen won't do any good imagine now it's going to go to Gold you need to buy gold if you ever listen to a radio there's 10 000 ads buy gold my brother and sister the first time you showed up at Albertsons and tried to carve off a chunk of gold to pay for your groceries you'd never make it to the parking lot especially when there's hungry people out there whose paper money isn't worth anything you see my brother and sister then we'd have to have an armored car parked out the door and then we would have to you know try to keep them from following us home oh no there's no end to this my brother and sister in the flesh we have no defense but in Christ amen we have Liberty we have one who has committed and said I am your defense and I will take care of you now that's all in the natural but look in the spiritual world there's many people even around the message that are afraid of being deceived and we'll look at this and realize if they just dig far enough in the message in other words not just gloss over the top if they'll dig in there you will realize my brother and sister as the prophet of God says you can't be deceived because you are the word my you can't be deceived if you're the word amen so what should we be doing not hiding in some bunker somewhere we should be in the word amen so that the word will be in US amen and so this whole world that's in turmoil amen Man by his very nature needs security we'll find security comes to Mankind in in various ways but we want to focus for just a moment by the nature of man God made us to need a sense of security or something very firm of security that to know that we're okay and some of this can be you know very hard and fixed some of this is just you might say a mirage amen now you'll find that Nations find a security in having borders that they can clearly put a line Amen brother Jeremy sister Emily living there the borders right there where they're at they deal with it Amen brother Jake he lives up there he deals with that border amen we we like it our way and that is the border of Oregon is right over here and I can drive over it just like that they have to go through the routine now the reason is these nations feel like they're secure by having this line and having something that stops on the highway maybe they check your credentials your passports Etc that makes them feel secure but the truth of it is in a natural sense their security is a false security because it is a very porous a line that that many things pass through and and do you know it is becoming more and more critical you know or more technical I should say that they're doing but my brother and sister there's a sense of security by having a defined border amen I know there's portions of Montana and North Dakota that there is only a little marker there telling you you are entering the United States or you are entering Canada there's no one there to defend it amen so you see the idea that we have to defend a border to feel secure is is a very earthy thing amen now you look at this and the armies that defend these borders gives you and I a sense of security we have an army defending this but you only have to go down to Nogales and some of these kind of places to realize that the armies are not doing a very good job defending it because you see my brother and sister the prophecy of the word will come to pass no matter how hard the governments of this Earth try to defend it amen try to change it that can't stop the word of God and so as it is we have homes you go to bed at night now get this my brother and sister I don't want to have anybody get nervous but we go to bed at night we walk around the house we lock the door and leave our bedroom window open for a nice breeze but we feel secure we go away and we lock up our house and we're comfortable because we lock the doors when well I won't go into the various methods but you can be inside of a house in about one minute and hardly leave a sign that you entered that's not for us common people there's another class of citizen but as you look at this see we have really in reality locks on the doors latches on the Windows is a false sense of security but we do feel secure and we feel secure inside that home we feel comfortable in our home amen if we have truly made this house whatever it's made out of into a home we feel comfortable in that home amen that's why we're seeing the song this world is not my home God never intended for you and I to become comfortable here he didn't want us to feel secure here he wanted us to always have that little bit of a feeling there's something I'm missing there's something I need to find I need to go on now if that is misinterpreted people will feel like maybe I don't have the Holy Ghost because there's a yearning in me but what God is doing is keeping you and I from putting Roots down that will anchor Us in laodicea and then when we put those kind of roots down the things of this life become more important than our relationship with God and so as we have you know what they say the more you have the more you must take care of Amen so sometimes people say if I only had this and I had that my brother and sister it actually has its own burden that goes with it amen so as you look at this you'll see that the denominational Christian my brother and sister brother Brown never was against the people in those denominations and we should be real careful that we don't look at that and make fun or mock of the people that are in there but what has happened is is because they've never been shown the open Word and realize that truly Christ is their only defense and that what do they do they fall back to the denomination if there's a question about anything you witness to them and you can clearly show them in scripture but yet because they're insecure where they stand because they've always stood in the shadow of their Church my brother and sister are the worst thing that you can do Grace is to stand in the shadow of the church and feel like that's going to make everything good for you God called for you to come and to walk in the light and to seek Revelation and be able to stand on the word the ministry the church is only here as a support to you it is not who you are and it's not there to form you it's the cry Life of Christ in you is what is intended to form you amen and to make you who God wants you to be so the denominational Christian finds Security in their denomination remember brother branham's there he's in the hospital and you know they're upset with him praying and you know their response I'll have you to know my brother and sister it's got nothing to do with it but the problem is we're seeing that creep into the message where we say well I've been in the message our family's been in the message or I was this or raised in the message none of that even matters one drop amen it's the relationship that we have with Jesus Christ is the only thing we can measure our security by but if we're not careful we will fall into that atmosphere that Spirit of laodicea that would come and we'll find security in the fact that our families always been in the message well I'll tell you what maybe we ought to change our vocabulary my family has been in Christ amen and let that be what we measure this by because you see now I'm not I'm not cutting down anything about recognizing that God is multi-generational right he runs down family lines that it's good to look out and see families it was kind of fun here recently to listen to The Dean Hart family interacting with people and how is so and so there you know not this and they're married to them and they were related to that and they could have cousin back there I just stood to the side and said wow I have no such testimony I have no such story to tell people are like oh do you know so and so never even heard the name before who oh their family's known in the message well I don't know maybe they stopped to the Mississippi I don't know if they ever came West or not I don't know or else they just flew over our head but we don't know them but I know one thing is the prophet of God said and they accused him of not knowing his Bible and he says okay I might not know my Bible I'm paraphrasing I might not know my Bible very well but I do know the author amen and that's what was a matter right there is they were looking at the book by memorizing the book they felt like they had it but when you know the author amen I've just read a little deal like that just here recently and it was talking about how this guy doing this research decided I'll be bold I'll go interview some of these authors of these best-selling books and so as he he was going to go interview them he thought you know what I don't want to come there and look ignorant so he bought each one of those books and read them right before he went to interview the author and he found some very profound things and so he's talking to these authors and he asks one of them I happen to be a lady and he asked her now you make this little reference in your story and and I just feel like there's something there and the author's like well as a matter of fact there is you see that was based on this experience that my aunt and uncle had back in this time period and I just kind of fictionalized it and brought it into this story oh my brother and sister if we could just sense that reading the Bible is not just a story but it's got something real and it's not fictionalized and it's brought down for you and I to be able to take a holds of it and I'm going to bring it a step further this message the prophet of God sharing some of these little stories some of these little things that happened people were like well what's the relevance of that he was trying to convey that there's something deeper than what's on the surface and only the bride of Christ is going to be you know they say well you want to read between the lines well I don't know why people I don't know how somebody in the message can argue against the fact of reading between the lines when the prophet of God says this little bride is going to take this word and she's going to read between the lines of this love letter and it's in that realm right there that the word becomes real to us because then it's no longer just a story but we become engaged we become part of that story and I say Lord help us today to be engaged amen so it's there my brother and sister as Christians Believers however you want to turn it turn it as Christians we've been given a place a shelter in a time of trouble we sing the song the name of the Lord is a strong tower now my brother and sister there's many that speak the name of Jesus Christ that have no security they have no place from their anxiety they have no place from the Troubles of Life they have no release of the cares of life but my brother and sister will look at this and realize what God wanted you and I to do now if we have sister Emily's a nurse amen and sister April being a doctor not here today but you know we have need of that anybody you know that doesn't think they have need of those kind of things as as needs to stop and go back and see what the prophet said you know when I about tore my right leg off years ago uh it wouldn't matter my brother and sister other than an outright touch of the Lord it wouldn't have mattered I could have walked around and I could have done that and I could have fell down in the grocery store I could have fell down at the park I could have fell down almost everywhere I still find it humorous my kids when I'd be in the grocery store and my knee would come out of joint and I would lay down on the floor and start moving my leg around you look around my kids weren't anywhere to be found no sir they'd be down the aisle with the Cheerios mm-hmm they had no desire for Cheerios they just didn't want to be identified with this guy flopping on the floor trying to put his leg back in joint now my brother and sister when we realized that God has an answer what I need right now this morning I need a medic I need a medic desperately this morning but there's no natural medic going to fix the wounds and the needs and the cares of my life and if I place my trust only in this then my brother and sister I would be a man most miserable but I have a God who hears my prayer can you say Amen here's my prayer and he knows my heart and he knows the thoughts of my mind and he is on the scene all the time amen you don't get up this line is busy but you've got a god that is caring and he's here to defend you you see we've been given this place this shelter where is it at my brother and sister where's this shelter the word there's our shelter there is no place on this Earth no bomb shelter no Financial tax shelter can I interest you on some I have a tax shelter you guys give me all your money I'll shelter it somewhere no that's not the world that we were called to live in they could take every dime from us my brother and sister but our faith in Jesus Christ will not waver because they've taken our possession they can come they can even take the very breath of this body and they believe they have accomplished something that the prophet of God brought such Clarity that death only offers us amen God uses there to harness us down to take us into the presence of God it would be almost as it were for those Apostles and those men stand before them Stephen if he had had it in those words could have said thank you for sending me into the presence of God that would have staggered their minds now it has staggered their thoughts that he would be there praising them thanking them for doing what they were doing because they were sure they were silencing that voice but my brother and sister Stephen's voice never stopped sounding now if you just give me a bit of Liberty this morning I believe quite possibly the Apostle Paul said that he had a thorn in his flesh now they put it to physical things they put it to other things but just bear with me for a moment what if the Apostle Paul's thorn in his flesh was the echo of the voices of the Believers that he put to death in the Dark Ages there's a recorded event of History of a man quite wealthy had become a Secret believer and someone had then revealed him to the authorities and they took him down and they tie him and they're going to burn him at the stake and they're pleading with him all you have to do is recant you've got a nice house you've got land you've got servants you've got money Jeffrey Canton live life and under the sway of that influence he recounts and all night long he's troubled and in the morning he rises early and goes down where they're preparing to burn Christians at the stake and says I recant my recante what would be the right word I don't want to put that to English I recant that I'm rejecting what I told you yesterday and they went to bind him to the post and he says you don't need to bind me to the post I will stand here they piled the wood up around him they light it on fire it's the last time according to history that they allowed that to happen not tying someone to the post because as the Flames come up around him his hands went up and they could hear his voice praising God my brother and sister where is the fear in that in this flesh there's fear in Christ our defense there's liberty to be able to praise God after that they were so haunted by his hands being raised and the last that they hear of his voice is him praising God that from that day on they chained them to the Post is our flesh that strong I'll tell you right now my flesh isn't but In Christ Alone and Christ Alone amen you see I've heard I've talked to Believers in the last while that expressed anxiety about what is coming what will they do to us brother Paul or what will happen my brother and sister what we really need to do is say you know what I have a defense burn this body drown this body throw this body off a cliff do whatever you want with this body this body's not me but in the human element we value the body so much that we want to defend the body amen and I'm not talking about hey look the Lord takes me home I'll just eat all the Snickers and Mountain Dew that I want and that'll just take me home so no if you suffer from that behavior then that was put upon by yourself not by God Amen you know so you can't you can't uh brother Donnie Reagan once said it ain't going to do any good to sit on the couch and eat that bag of potato chips and say Lord take away all the harmful effects you can eat only potato chips and soda pop you'll deal with the issues of potato chips and soda pop my brother and sister now God can heal you from that but he never wanted you to inflict that upon yourself in the beginning amen that is my health lesson of the day amen now so what happens is God setting us in place that the word has become our only shelter our only safety remember I don't know this won't apply to all of you so forgive me but remember when many of us first come into the message or it really started to get real to us we looked at that and we thought but I can't live without this and I can't live without that and somewhere along the line it left yeah we might not even be able to pinpoint the day and the time I remember one time being part of a conversation and brothers and and certainly I'm the one that felt inadequate I'm the one that felt the little complex and these brothers are and they're like wouldn't you get the Holy Ghost well we were in these meetings in 1976 and and I was sitting there and brother so and so was preaching in the tent and and it was there and I got the Holy Ghost and another brother yeah you know praise God yeah I was here brother so and so on these services in this deal right here and you know when the brother laid his hand on my back and said Lord fill him with the Holy Ghost something changed in me and it gets to me and I just Mom I kind of I can't pinpoint the day little by little he's changing changing man changing me I look at those Brothers I'm almost like envious is that okay to talk this Frank almost like envious these brothers can like pinpoint it to a time this camp meeting these special services this time in the tent this brother praying and they can pinpoint it to that and their lives show that they truly have the Holy Ghost and I'm over here going oh my little by little Lord little by little I still am still being changed and still lord it's doing and you know then you want to preach on stubbornness and realize that you know somebody in the church might think you're preaching about them when really you're preaching about yourself you know that happens more than you think the church is like man the pastor was sure hard on us today or the minister will sure hard on us and the preacher goes home and says man Lord you were sure hard on me don't be too rash to judge you don't know what God's dealing amen so where do you and I find security we've already said the word let's make it more personal the husband by God's design finds security in the presence of his wife there's a comfort factor sometimes I'm just secure I just put it real blunt to you I'm just secure knowing my wife is in the house she's like well you're not talking to me or you didn't and I'm negligent on that Lord help me but I have this security my wife is just right there around the corner and many a wife finds that security knowing my husband's in the house he's here and if I need him he's right there available to me so take those and spiritualize them and you'll realize what is happening God has put this nature in us to find security in the presence of our bridegroom when we are in the presence of our husband we feel secure amen so we don't have to be running around the house now hear me you know have to be running around the house praise God I got a husband he's in the room you don't have to be saying husband will you keep me safe he's in the room are you with me I don't want to belabor this too long now my brother and sister what it is is when we have come in the presence of our bridegroom something is anchored in the soul at this speaking now when does marriage take place something that ought to be taught a little bit more in the message is that marriage doesn't take place when that young man and that young woman are at the altar up here and they say I do and then they kiss and and they go out now they're married my brother and sister it comes right down to the relationship with our bridegroom Jesus Christ that the prophet taught us that the marriage takes place at the commitment so that's been a problem around the message I'll just be blunt is there's been many a young couple said oh will you marry me yes I'll marry you and then they go off and something happens they go different ways and they don't realize that they've actually put themselves under a vow or a commitment and there it is that they just go off and it's a whole different person different situation and they don't even know any different because no one has bothered to teach them but my brother and sister I want you to know looking at it from the spiritual side that when we come as Sons and Daughters of God and we take the thou Lord I will serve you I love you Lord he didn't say now when you are like this and when you are like that have you ever noticed that every girl that gets married goes on a diet maybe not every girl some of them already skinny and some just don't care but it's a trend you see it all the time Jerry's like oh my goodness where is my husband going but my brother and sister God doesn't wait to accept or vow after we have changed we don't have to get skinny we don't have to be perfect we don't have to this amen you give the vow God says I accept it you're mine amen so it's in that place we can find our security and I brought up brother Bud Southwick the other day I'll bring him up again brother Branham didn't say Bud you're not going to get the Holy Ghost until you get over that smoking and if you don't this and if you don't that bud no what did he do he just spoke those words which were the right words in the right time brother bud when did you quit smoking and he says right now brother Branham brother Branham doesn't say well we'll just see why because he recognized that bud Southwick had just now taken a vow to God and God was the one who would fulfill that vow so it's there in that realm we'll find that security you can stand on it you can you can remain very secure in that amen and somebody stole the time again this Sunday in the seven Church ages Ephesian Church Aid now I brought this up the other day I don't remember if I read the quote or I I just mentioned it but brother Brown says right here in Ephesian Church Aid someone's going to ask me this question did God tell Eve to watch out for the serpent or their serpent would seduce her hmm can you find that in your Bible no you can't now listen God didn't have to say one thing about what would happen just get the point of the story he simply gave the word he said not to partake of knowledge partake of life life was the word of God death was anything that wasn't the word of God now my brother and sister we're coming to a stage in the message at this metamorphosis of time we talk about Revelation talk about reading between the lines people are reading between the lines so far that they're saying well now brother Brown says this this and this here and that means this this and this and my brother and sister this this and this over here is contrary to the written word of God and they say well but brother Branham said it well I'm telling you you have made a mistake in how you interpreted what the prophet said because the prophet is subject to the word himself and Paul said if they change even one word so if that's the case and brother Brown actually changed it we're following a false message but we're not we have the revealed word of the hour it's man's interpretation of the word so what is it coming here amen God didn't have to say one thing right don't partake of knowledge partake of life and life was the word of God Amen death was anything that wasn't my one word just change one word she allowed one word to be changed and right then Satan had her God could have said don't pick more fruit off the trees than you can eat Satan would say look that's quite right you see if you pick too much food it will rot but here is a method of preserving the fruit it's called denominationalism and let the same time and at the same time you can pick all you want see how Satan's so clever he comes along and he just makes it so natural it makes so much sense hmm that's why this message my brother and sister should not be a Doctrine it should be a life amen because doctrines can be argued and over time doctrines can shift but if you have life you know there's artificial life support but you've never seen a person on artificial little frog in my throat you've never seen a person on artificial or life support get up and live life they're confined that's right they're right there something's pumping their blood some things breathing something's doing that my brother and sister there's nothing artificial in God's life God's life is the original life amen see you can have your way this is what Satan's trying to Peddle this you get this in context uh Satan's throwing this thought out see you can have your way and God's way at the same time boy that's what the devil would like the Christian world to believe today that we can have our way and God's way and those things creep in my brother and sister remember if the boat's in the water the water will be in the boat and so if we are here in this world which is controlled by a denominational Spirit which is the Antichrist then that means that you and I will be buffeted by Antichrist Spirit now don't sit here and say oh my goodness I must be backsliding I'm I must be losing my understanding my love for the Lord uh what is it no my brother and sister throw the water out of the boat that's all you got to do you just gotta stop and say Satan that's not the word that's not who I am I don't accept that but if we let it go my brother and sister I was just reading about a boat pretty good sized boat off the coast of Florida they literally took the boat out that morning knowing that they had a propeller shaft seal that was leaking water but we're not going to be gone in this world long enough for that to be a problem I know that there's things wrong and I'm not going to repent or I don't feel inclined to repent and everything will be fine we'll have the boat back in and on the trailer in just a couple hours this is a big boat surely there can't be that much water get in the boat until it went glub Club you see that sounds silly I don't want to vote with you if you think that water running in the boat is okay I don't want to hang out with you don't offer me an all-day fishing trip off the coast all expenses paid if the boat is leaking water you can have your way in God's way at the same time the devil would have her right there he is that guilty in one point he that is guilty in one point of the law has broken the whole law don't fool with that word amen amen don't you like that I like that you say brother Paul we know that we know that that's right I'm just here to stir up your pure Minds in remembrance we don't have to have some new startling Revelation out of the word every time we come to church sometimes we just need reminded wouldn't that be awesome Brothers if every day when we came home from work our wives had just cooked up some new absolutely fascinating incredible meal labored over the stove for Endless hours every day to watch us wipe it out in 10 minutes and they were so inspired that every day they did that but wait there are certain things I dislike there are certain things I I don't want a little secret communication here I don't need some of my meals with some new spice from Ceylon and I don't need cilantro on everything I eat and I don't want this and that sometimes just give me the original that is throw that stake on there sear it on that side sear it on that side jab it with a fork and if it doesn't go moo put it on the plate I'm ready for it and I could eat that about five times a week just give me the original but what is the nature of man we went to a restaurant sometime back and the waiter is just like well and this is and I'm sitting there I'm feeling very inadequate but I was like man I can't even order off this menu I don't even know what they're talking about I finally look up at the guy what is this he looks down at me little expression across his face you would call it mashed potatoes with garlic thank you sir that's what I like mashed potatoes with garlic not well anyway so to some the confines of the word are too restrictive we've all met those people that are like no no the message message is law it's legalism it is well I'd like to introduce them to real legalism my brother and sister if they think this message is legalism but here's the thing that's scary is while they're standing there saying the message is too confining for me Satan's right there if you can Envision him right on the side top on the shoulder hey I've got some Liberty for you but what they don't understand is Satan's version of Liberty takes you right back amen it was a Garden Eden kind of Liberty amen he's going to spice up their life with a Garden of Eden type Liberty that gives him now my brothers and sisters this little blood block bride she's she's sitting here she just wants to serve God and uh she's just there and we seem so old-fashioned I had someone recently you know go now Paul you know it seems like you have really nice people you know kind of your old-fashioned religion yes thank you Lord Give Me That Old Time religion give me that why they're looking for something new they're looking for something modern they're looking for uh the the flashing lights the dark sitting in they like to sit in the dark I just seen a picture here recently hope I'm not boring you but I've seen a picture who recently taken in a mega church and the lights are down low and there's people watching basketball football and soccer during church oh we were so blessed to be in church today you know got their phones they're up in the balcony and they're like yes but amen no they're they're watching sports my brother and sister but they'll tell you I was in church today no you were in a building today my brother and sister the prophet of God called it a lodge amen so what happens is see we can't have let's just get this straight we can't have our way and God's way at the same time we have to stop and say Lord whatever your will is amen so we'll just quit here in just a moment there is a saying and this is how I heard it others might have heard it slightly different but it used to be around individually used to say this saying pretty regular those who would give up freedom for security will have neither and that actually is a takeoff of what Benjamin's Franklin's quote was that those who would give up essential Liberty to purchase a little temporary safety deserve neither Liberty nor safety now let's put this into a church realm and these are my words might not be the most eloquent but I would say it like this those who would give up the word our safety to purchase a little temporary Liberty will have neither amen our Liberty I don't know about you Saints I believe I do I think I'll just go ahead and speak the positive can I speak the positive amen my brother and sister our Liberty is only found in the word now I'll back this up with this quote I don't like to normally quote other preachers as it were so much but look at this Charles Spurgeon says it this way it is where the spirit of the Lord is that there is liberty and nowhere else so people think they're finding Liberty by skirting The Edge my brother and sister oh it's exhilarating I'll tell you what we ought to go find that wall that brother Brown was talking about now bear with me we're talking figurative we'll find that wall of that Chariot driver who can drive that Chariot wheel right there in all reality how many of us would ride with him in the natural we're Brave we're bold we like excitement we climb mountains we hunt wild animals we do this we do that what are you doing driving over there get away from that that's my life but look what happens under this anointing of I want to serve god with some Liberty I want to just go right over here and I want to have half of my heel hanging off in laodicea at all times it's exhilarating can I make an admission I get embarrassed as all get out when brother George brought up the fact we went into a movie theater and watch the movie The Apostle Paul half the time I'm sitting there watching this very profound very moving movie and I doubt of sister Jerry noticed but I kept looking up towards the ceiling [Laughter] and the prophet's words echoing in my mind them demons are hanging around there now I want to ask you a question because the movie about the Apostle Paul was a movie expression of the word you think them demons were moved and left no now don't blame brother George don't blame bro it's yours I'm the one that said yes but you talk about being ashamed embarrassed and want to crawl underneath the rug you know brother George yeah I took brother Paul to the theater we watched the Apostle Paul and I'm you know really what I wanted to do is be able if I could to take my glasses and put them like this and see what all your Expressions were our pastor in a theater now this is years ago I've had plenty of repentance but you see my brother and sister that's what we want is the word to be ingrained in us enough that we don't callously say this one time of sinning this one time of this one time of that won't hurt me it affected me I'm just being open to you affected me enough that I still feel grieved to this day and here again don't blame brother George it was playing in the theater brother George says I've seen this video and it's so good it's playing right there let's go watch it don't blame brother George I blame myself that's all right it'll show up on a DVD and and uh if brother Trevor sister Cario buy it I'll borrow it I don't even have to spend any money but you see how that we come into these positions but what is our defense now I I'm I'm ashamed of myself and I want you to understand that but I know God has Grace and I was moved by that and and it had a profound effect on me and I've made a commitment that I don't care how many religious movies there are I'm not going back into that movie house with those demons hanging around on the balcony now if you don't mind going there that's fine that might be your Garden of Eden but it's not my Garden of Eden and I don't mean that horse and I don't mean that judgmental you see my brother and sister it's where the spirit of the Lord is is that there's liberty and if you're sitting in a theater watching a incredible religious movie looking at the balcony that's not Liberty and God has a way of correcting us and it's not as a harsh-handed father sometimes it's a love and correction I warned you I sent a prophet to tell you demons hang out in those places have no idea what played in that place before might have been something that I would have just been huh I would not go in there for nothing but then we'll walk in there because it's got a certain flavor the demons didn't leave seven sons of seba I won't go into a perfect example they could have went in there and said now this and this and this and this which really is what they did do because they had no truth behind their words Satan said huh damn I know but who are you well I want him to look and say well this is just mere mortal flesh but he's got the word in him and if I deal with him I'm dealing with the word and so I must listen I've got so much more I knew this was going to carry out too long Sister Sarah praise the Lord I don't know Ephesians 1 1-14 you can take some homework what you're going to see right there is I'll just end up preaching it to you anyway here but what you'll see see is is in verse 4 according as he has chosen Us in him before the foundation of the world that we should be holding Without Blame before him in love what is that that's Liberty see God's giving us these these you might say daily doses of Liberty through the word he's just pouring Liberty in US amen you might take a a drink of cough syrup or you might have some kind of liquid vitamin or something and you don't drink the whole bottle in one day right you take a drink as it were or you take that each and every day and it starts to have enough impact on you and here's God through the word I hope you can take this home and mull on this a little bit through the word God is putting Liberty in you and I you say well I need a revelation to see who I am no except the Liberty that's in the word already you don't have to have a great Revelation to find Liberty in the word and you will find that God as you dig in the word God will be there to defend your life for you amen we don't have to try to make our life something that it's not my I've got a whole bunch of other things here amen I do want to read presuming though amen and all those names that was before the foundation of the world predestinated all that the father has given me will come to me yes sir all that he foreknew he called all that he calls he justifies and those that is Justified he has glorified Paul according to Ephesians 1 and that's why I had Ephesians 1 to kind of go into the explanation God predestinated us before the foundation of the world to the adoptions of sons in Jesus Christ how are you going to stop it I want to ask you Saints if God's called you I don't care what trouble we're going through God has called you how's the devil going to stop it because if he could stop it he would have stopped it a long time ago amen so what it is how are you going to stop it all devils in hell you might as well quit fussing about it well I'll tell you what I read this and I'm like I'm going to adopt this you're gonna start you guys will probably find Paul he's having a rough day smashed his fingers this doesn't work that doesn't work devil quit fussing ain't got nothing to do with me I've always looked at it like it was my fault oh that I I just wasn't good enough I couldn't do this I do not Lord I got upset about this I said this I thought this oh Lord but my brother and sister you know how it is if you got somebody that's right next to you or fussing pretty soon it rubs off on you come on you guys know what that's like amen husbands and wives amen one of you is going to be all calm and collected the other one's chewing the door jamb off and you know and pretty soon both of you are it very rarely works the other way that the Coleman collected when rubs over on the other one and they suddenly become calm isn't that weird I think I'm going to take this stance devil just quit your fussing my name's in the book I've been predestinated I've been called and I'm responding to that call so just you know what it's like to be dismissed come on I'm going to touch on a personal level with you guys you need to be honest with me do any of you like when you're in a conversation you're like uh I was talking to you you're just dismissed if you feel that way the devil will feel that way when you start looking at him in the face and say you know what devil [Music] I'm out of here my name's in the book it doesn't matter what you say doesn't matter what you try to do I'm in the book amen aren't you glad I want to tell the devil quit his fussing amen all the devils in hell you might as well quit fussing about it it's going to be there without spot or wrinkle it's going to be a what a bride Church Hallelujah God said I will restore restore what one without an organization to touch it one with the pure unadulterated word it has to come all I can say is thank you Lord this morning amen he is our defense my brother and sister the devil's doing everything he can to attack us he's trying to attack marriages he's trying to attack the parent-child relationship he's trying to attack the fellowship within the body of Believers he's trying to attack us on our approach to the word and my brother and sister nothing like having someone be told just go home before you get hurt devil back off I've got no time for you he's our defense amen my brothers and sisters I want to share one last little thing that I read I found quite interesting there was a ranch in Texas I don't know I can't pronounce really uh the the area [Music] like that in those days it was nothing out there and yet there were men took their wives their children cattle good grass they would go out there Brave or foolish depend on who you're talking about but the ones that survived were the ones that planned for the enemy to attack them in this case it was the Native Americans Comanches and Etc they planned on it they never thought well if they do or if they don't they said they're going to and they planned accordingly this story I read about is a ranch that still exists this day uh and uh they they drilled the well double oh well pretty soon realized that the Indians attack us we're going to be in our Stone House with a dirt roof that they can't light on fire but we'll have no water so this added on to the house until it encapsulated the well so now they've got Stone dirt water and then they said but if we we are in here and our horses are there they'll take all our horses and then we're in trouble also so they made provision for that and then they built another deal and they built a guard house and they built all these things and when the Indians would come and attack them they found that these people were so prepared the enemies it cost them too much they weren't out there scalping the men and women they were dying and the reason I want to share this to you God's given us ample opportunity we know the devil's going to attack us amen and he's given us his word that we can prepare ourselves and he's also given the word that sometimes in the preaching of the word we say well is is that in our church is that there no my brother and sister the devil's just waiting to introduce anything he can introduce to cause chaos it isn't that we start looking over our shoulder is it that family is it that family is it that brother that sister no no no God sometimes just preaches the word for us to be prepared and recognize the enemy and know that we've been given a defense and amen I tell you we stand here today no we're not going to build a house over the well we're not going to build a fortified stable we're not going to put dirt on the roof we're going to get in the word and the prophet of God said if we are under the blood of Jesus Christ Satan can't get to us oh Lord help us that's our defense my brother and sister the word hallelujah hallelujah I hope I made at least a couple moments of sense this morning amen but I tell you my brother and sister amen the very word that they say confines us the bride of Christ Liberty thank you Lord all I can say thank you Lord amen let's sing that song 478. Let's just stand sing a song or two before we're dismissed amen I hope it made sense you know it's hard sometimes when you've got all these things that are connected together and you realize that we're going to be here at four o'clock if I preach them all and you start just cutting things out you start now we'll leave that to the side always leaves a little hole in there you know what I mean and inspiration is as ministers we want to fill the hole we don't want to just leave any Gap anywhere and yet you look at the clock and the clock is just going away Hallelujah for a long time I try my heart was so heavy it's in I sang glory and then I heard about Jesus oh what a wonderful hour I'm so glad that I found out it could bring me out his saving powers thank God I am I am free oh yes I'm

well I'm so glad that I found out he could bring me out show me way aren't you glad amen we've been showed the way Hallelujah my brother and sister it's so interesting you can take almost any other modern religion and ask them to go back to the Bible and anchor what they believe in the Bible well you're following a man where'd the Baptist Church start or the Methodist Church star or the Nazarene Church star where do the Mormons start you know they started the Catholic Church on a man who wasn't even present wow but we have a very clear word of Prophecy that said you will have need for the word to be revealed to you and we can take it back we don't lift the man up I'm sorry the man was a man but he was a man God chose just the same as we are men and women that God chose that ought to make our heart Rejoice because if you reject God's choice there then that leaves the door open for us to be rejected and I'm sorry I'm not rejected I've been accepted in the presence of the king Hallelujah this world is not my hope I'm at the passing through my treasures are laid off somewhere beyond the blue the Angels record me from Heaven's open door and knocked and feel that home in this

Jesus amen hallelujah amen well God bless your Saints trust you'll be able to go home today and say it was good to be in the house of the Lord amen and I trust all as a minister we can do is just be able to speak the things that God speaks to us and I just trust as we look at this that we'll just stop and be able to realize this battle I'm in right now this struggle I'm in right now if I'll just let go God will defend me I don't I don't have to defend myself you see every time sister Sue just gave me a book she she blesses me with these books of history and as you read this book it's written so deep and so intense that I just have to ponder it really slow I've maybe only got 30 pages of it read they give all kinds of Glory to this leadership but the book takes you down into the trench and in the battles that were won I hope I'm not boring you here but in the battles that were won there was a time German Panzer tank driving right up to where they were at and the barrel being lowered down and it's starting to point right at them and some of the guys said were dead and another guy says we're the victors and climbed out the trench and put a thermite deal on the tank and blew it up we got a choice stand on the word and say I've been given everything I need or we can say we're defeated and run now the men that ran very sad story we're mowed down by other enemy Soldiers the ones that stood right there in the face of the battle and said I've been called to be a Victor in laodicea I've been called to stay right here do I have no foes to fight do I have foes to run from there's our decision I have foes to fight my brother and sister fight but fight with what God has given you not what we think not what we feel not what our emotion says but what God has given and we have been given the word take the word amen take the word don't let someone take it from you this word was given to you and God confirmed that when he wrote your name in the book he didn't say oh this one will run he said no listen when it was Damned I want to be found standing in that day God bless you turn to one another say those precious words of God bless you amen I pray the rest of your day is a glorious time bless your Saints we love you amen [Music] thank you thank you [Music] foreign [Music] thank you foreign [Music] foreign foreign foreign foreign [Music] thank you foreign foreign [Music]
