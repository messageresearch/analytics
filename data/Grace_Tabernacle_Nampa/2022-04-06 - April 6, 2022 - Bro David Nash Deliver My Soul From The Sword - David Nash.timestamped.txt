[13:21] of his cleansing power
[13:24] revealing
[13:26] how he made the length to walk again and
[13:31] cause a blind to see
[13:34] and then i cried

[25:52] love you
[25:58] singing
[26:00] [Music]
[26:17] once more
[26:19] [Music]
[26:36] you
[26:40] [Music]
[26:45] love
[26:47] you
[26:49] [Music]
[27:01] gracious heavenly father
[27:04] as we think about salvation we think
[27:06] about the word of god
[27:08] the revelation of god the revelation of
[27:11] the end time the message of the hour
[27:14] lord i think of all these things and
[27:16] what's it all come back to
[27:20] you sent a prophet that told us nothing
[27:22] but perfect love will enter that place
[27:26] and so when we boil salvation all down
[27:28] to the simplest form
[27:30] it's a love affair with jesus christ
[27:34] you've heard the cries of the people
[27:37] you've requested lord that we take you
[27:40] at your word
[27:41] and i ask tonight that you take them at
[27:43] their word
[27:45] take me at my word as we say lord jesus
[27:48] i love you
[27:51] with that in mind god as we approach
[27:53] your word
[27:54] we ask you just fill each and every
[27:56] heart tonight
[27:58] quick and afresh the love of god in
[28:00] jesus christ and each and every one of
[28:02] us that this dying filthy sin cursed
[28:05] world could just one more time
[28:08] in your little bride
[28:10] see the love of god
[28:13] through jesus christ in each and every
[28:14] life tonight
[28:17] i thank you for it i praise you for it
[28:20] as we give you this service
[28:22] in the name of jesus christ
[28:27] [Music]
[28:41] you
[28:44] [Music]
[28:52] love you
[28:55] [Music]
[28:58] i
[29:01] love
[29:03] you
[29:06] praise the lord thank you sister
[29:08] wonderful
[29:10] thank you congregation
[29:12] well praise god
[29:14] we
[29:16] falls our lot once again to be here this
[29:18] evening
[29:20] and it's always an honor a privilege
[29:23] to be able to stand before the bride of
[29:25] jesus christ
[29:27] and an honor to stand in the presence of
[29:29] almighty god
[29:32] i love him
[29:34] let's not to keep you standing let's
[29:36] turn to psalms 22.
[29:40] and just a couple verses there
[29:43] and then maybe over into hebrews
[29:50] seems like the further i go
[29:53] along this road of salvation if you
[29:56] could call it that
[29:58] i suppose god just
[30:01] opens things more and more
[30:03] and more
[30:04] we know the prophet of god told us that
[30:07] every scripture has compound meaning
[30:10] and compound revelation
[30:12] and not only that that every scripture
[30:14] will somehow point it to jesus christ
[30:18] so with that in mind in psalms the 22nd
[30:21] chapter
[30:23] uh
[30:24] let's start with verse 14 and we'll read
[30:26] down through
[30:27] i think it's 20.
[30:29] he said i am poured out like water and
[30:31] all my bones are out of joint my heart
[30:33] is like wax it is melted in the midst of
[30:35] my bowels my strength is dried up like a
[30:38] potsherd and my tongue cleaves to the
[30:40] roof of my jaws
[30:42] and thou hast brought me into the dust
[30:44] of death for dogs have compassed me
[30:47] about the assembly of the wicked have
[30:48] enclosed me they have pierced my hands
[30:50] my feet so we know automatically this is
[30:53] talking about jesus christ
[30:55] so let's continue
[30:58] i may tell
[30:59] all my bones they look they stare at me
[31:02] they part my garments among them they
[31:04] cast lots upon my vesture
[31:06] be thou not far from me o lord o my
[31:09] strength hasty to help me
[31:11] and for the text tonight will take from
[31:13] verse 20 deliver my soul from the sword
[31:17] my darling from the power of the dog
[31:19] save me from the lion's mouth for that
[31:20] has turned me from the horns
[31:23] of the unicorns
[31:24] gracious heavenly father we've read thy
[31:26] word
[31:27] we ask you would just open it afresh to
[31:30] us
[31:31] let the presence of the holy spirit lord
[31:33] just fill each and every heart in our
[31:36] lives with a revelation afresh of jesus
[31:38] christ as we ask in in thy name amen
[31:43] while you're being seated i'll read from
[31:44] hebrews the fourth chapter
[31:49] very familiar
[31:51] verse of course for
[31:53] those who
[31:55] are followers of the message of the hour
[32:02] i don't know if it's that all the coffin
[32:04] and the sniffling everybody's got going
[32:06] or if it's the new flowers coming out
[32:07] but my
[32:09] if your nose runs and your feet smell
[32:10] you're built backwards is what i was
[32:12] told so anyway here we are
[32:17] in hebrews chapter 4
[32:19] very familiar scripture in verse 12
[32:23] for the word of god is quick and
[32:25] powerful and sharper than any two-edged
[32:27] sword piece piercing even to the
[32:29] dividing asunder of soul and spirit and
[32:32] of joint and marrow and is the discerner
[32:35] of the thoughts and intents of the heart
[32:38] may god add his blessing to the word
[32:41] we've been ministering off and on along
[32:45] the word of god and
[32:48] how that when the word of god comes
[32:50] forth and when we receive it
[32:53] do we have a bottle of water somewhere
[32:55] that i could
[32:57] down below
[33:00] we're empty tonight
[33:03] but
[33:04] how that when the word of god comes
[33:05] forth we know that
[33:07] as we mentioned every scripture has
[33:09] compound meaning and revelation and
[33:11] every spirit or every word
[33:14] tells us something about jesus christ
[33:16] thank you brother paul
[33:18] and i know i've showed this here before
[33:20] but i want to touch on it one more time
[33:23] we talk about the seals and the seven
[33:25] seals and so forth and how that uh
[33:29] brother louis kelson years ago preached
[33:31] a fantastic message about the opening of
[33:34] the seals and i i can't remember where
[33:36] he got the particular quotes but uh
[33:40] we know that the seals were the there
[33:42] was the first one and then they sealed
[33:43] at the second one they sealed it third
[33:45] one sealed it and so forth but when he
[33:47] got to the seventh he said he took that
[33:49] one and he put that seal over all of the
[33:51] rest
[33:53] and how that he had to tear the seventh
[33:55] one back and then the six five four
[33:57] three two one and then when you got back
[33:59] to one then you start
[34:01] through the other direction
[34:04] so and how that uh
[34:07] he couldn't he wouldn't tell us
[34:10] he was a major word prophet so he can
[34:11] only tell us what the word says
[34:14] and the word says there was silence in
[34:16] heaven for the space of a half an hour
[34:18] so
[34:19] he could only tell us silence how do you
[34:21] speak silence right so
[34:24] but he did give us some little clues one
[34:26] place he said the seventh seal is jesus
[34:28] christ
[34:29] another place he said it is the rapture
[34:33] which of course it is because jesus said
[34:35] i am the resurrection and the rapture so
[34:38] our resurrection and our rapture is tied
[34:41] into our love affair with jesus christ
[34:44] if you don't have him on the inside it
[34:46] doesn't matter when it happens or how it
[34:48] happens
[34:49] you're not you're just not going to be
[34:51] there
[34:52] you're not going to see it you're not
[34:53] going to know because it also says that
[34:56] you know it's coming as a thief in the
[34:57] night
[34:58] so
[35:00] every word of god expresses somehow
[35:04] the nature of jesus christ
[35:07] and as we look through the scripture
[35:10] we
[35:12] see that
[35:13] all of these things relate of course to
[35:16] our day and our age because we're the
[35:18] ones that are called as the song
[35:19] wonderful song
[35:21] you were singing about
[35:23] this is the age
[35:25] this is the going home age this is the
[35:27] time this is where we we got to the
[35:29] corner
[35:30] and brother branham said if you don't
[35:32] turn the corner
[35:33] you know you just go off into
[35:35] destruction
[35:36] if you ever want an interesting study
[35:38] brother dave go into proverbs chapter 7
[35:41] and 5 find out who's standing at the
[35:43] corner and what happens when you meet
[35:45] her at the corner
[35:47] so
[35:49] but with the water
[35:54] we've talked about the word of god being
[35:55] transitive
[35:56] and how we this water just became
[35:59] transitive because he moved it from that
[36:01] room to here and i moved it from here
[36:03] and into me
[36:07] thank you
[36:09] wonderful
[36:10] so what just happened we moved the water
[36:14] and many scriptures
[36:15] many many scriptures if we get into the
[36:18] what that says about them it says
[36:20] they're transitive meaning that they can
[36:22] be moved
[36:23] from one place to another so you can
[36:25] take
[36:28] these scriptures that are written in ink
[36:30] and you can move them you can i can move
[36:32] them this way and this way or we can
[36:35] move them from here
[36:37] to here
[36:39] or here to here
[36:40] or here to
[36:41] here
[36:43] and when they come to hear
[36:45] then they should come back out here
[36:47] because out of the abundance of the
[36:48] heart the mouth speaks
[36:50] and so
[36:52] they become
[36:53] transitive words
[36:55] so the water became transitive you know
[36:56] where it went it's pretty obvious in
[36:58] fact it tastes good so i'm going to have
[36:59] a little more
[37:03] but what else happened
[37:06] the water became part of me
[37:08] and i became part of the water
[37:11] that's again that's obvious and we know
[37:13] with
[37:14] but there's something else that just
[37:16] happened that you couldn't hear it i
[37:18] mean you might have heard me swallow the
[37:19] water but you don't see this next part
[37:23] you didn't hear it
[37:25] you can't really see it even though you
[37:27] saw me
[37:28] drink it but what really happens with
[37:31] the water is human beings can't survive
[37:33] without water
[37:35] so in this water that i'm drinking
[37:38] is another feature that you can't see
[37:40] taste hear smell or touch
[37:45] for a human being it's life
[37:48] and it's silent
[37:50] you don't see the water i mean the life
[37:53] that's in the water
[37:54] move into me and bring life into my body
[37:58] friends it's the seventh seal
[38:01] it's the life of god being transferred
[38:04] he said come unto me and drink
[38:06] and he said i'll give you a drink that
[38:08] you'll never thirst again
[38:10] and when you drink this water
[38:13] and it goes into your heart the life
[38:15] comes with it
[38:17] the life of jesus christ begins to
[38:20] transfer itself into us
[38:23] by the drink that we take from the word
[38:26] of god
[38:27] amen and we become partakers of
[38:30] the seventh seal which is jesus christ
[38:34] and which is
[38:35] our rapture
[38:37] and a multitude of other things
[38:40] but it's the life being transferred
[38:43] from the word
[38:44] into your my heart
[38:46] that we might become
[38:49] by the spoken word the sons and
[38:51] daughters of god
[38:53] or be manifested as what we've always
[38:55] have been
[38:57] the life that we had with him before the
[39:00] foundation of the world
[39:04] so with those things in mind but another
[39:06] thing comes with that life
[39:08] there's the nature behind the life
[39:11] especially when you start to get into
[39:12] the word of god now we read there we
[39:14] know that's that particular
[39:17] uh
[39:17] portion of scripture there in psalms 22
[39:20] we know that's talking about calvary
[39:21] they pierced my hands they did this and
[39:23] i am poured out like water and i think
[39:26] we ministered a few years ago about how
[39:28] that
[39:30] christ was poured out at calvary jehovah
[39:32] god poured himself out to us through
[39:35] jesus christ
[39:36] and all those things are
[39:38] the nature of god being expressed but it
[39:40] was expressed
[39:43] in prophecy first
[39:45] and from that prophecy they put it into
[39:47] writing and from that writing then we go
[39:49] back and we can look and say oh
[39:52] because we know the history
[39:54] we can go oh they pierced his hands his
[39:57] side his feet and that's
[39:59] and so we see the nature
[40:01] [Music]
[40:02] of these words manifested in jesus
[40:05] christ
[40:06] and as we receive that so likewise we
[40:10] receive the nature
[40:12] behind those words
[40:15] so as we think about
[40:18] those things
[40:20] and i read there from psalms
[40:22] 22
[40:25] and how the the nature of god
[40:28] is in the words
[40:30] lord willing we'll get to uh
[40:32] if he grants me a little grace this
[40:34] evening
[40:36] so we read we're reading there about
[40:37] calvary and how he talks about i'm dried
[40:40] up like a potsherd in my tongue cleaves
[40:42] to my jaws i brought to the dust of
[40:44] death we know all of those things are
[40:47] almost
[40:48] you know like a news report
[40:50] of jesus christ at calvary
[40:53] and he comes down there but then he says
[40:56] this interesting thing there
[40:58] he says be not far from me o lord my
[41:01] strength haste thee to help me
[41:04] well we know at one point he cries out
[41:07] in fact i think it's even in this same
[41:08] psalm earlier on
[41:10] yeah in fact it starts verse one my god
[41:12] my god why hast thou forsaken me
[41:15] so
[41:16] and and such and so but here he's saying
[41:20] you know
[41:22] be not far from me o lord my strength
[41:24] hasty to help me and so he's calling out
[41:27] for this and the word of god is
[41:29] expressing itself and it's moving as it
[41:32] were giving us this picture in prophecy
[41:36] form of what's happening at calvary and
[41:39] the life of god being poured out the the
[41:42] word of god being poured out through
[41:44] jesus christ because he is the word of
[41:46] god then he comes down to this 20th
[41:48] verse and i found this
[41:50] really interesting
[41:52] because he said deliver my soul from the
[41:55] sword if we were given a message to
[41:57] tonight i would use that as a title
[42:00] deliver my soul from the sword
[42:04] as human beings when we hear or when i
[42:06] hear something like that i'm usually
[42:08] thinking that somebody's chasing me
[42:09] coming after me with the sword i'm gonna
[42:11] work me over
[42:13] and that's what you know lord deliver me
[42:16] from the sword i don't want to go down
[42:17] by the sword i don't brother branham
[42:19] said he didn't like swords he said he
[42:20] was afraid of him he was glad that he
[42:22] wasn't born in that age because he
[42:24] didn't want to ever have to use one
[42:26] so what's the lord putting his hand a
[42:28] sword
[42:30] but it's a different kind of sword
[42:33] he said when he said you know what and
[42:35] he said it's the sword
[42:37] of the king the king not a king but
[42:41] the king
[42:42] and so we see the nature of god he says
[42:45] deliver my soul
[42:47] from the sword
[42:49] we know that jesus christ is the word of
[42:52] god i read there from hebrew the word of
[42:54] god is sharp as a two-edged sword let's
[42:56] read it again we can bring it up are you
[42:58] in a hurry tonight
[43:01] i just
[43:03] i love the word of god i really do
[43:07] he said the word of god is sharp
[43:10] chapter 4 verse 12.
[43:13] he said the word of god is quick and
[43:15] powerful sharper than any two-edged
[43:17] sword piercing even to the dividing
[43:19] asunder of the soul and the spirit the
[43:21] joints the marrow and is a discerner of
[43:23] the thoughts and the intents of the
[43:26] heart
[43:28] so the word of god is
[43:30] quick it's powerful
[43:33] sharper than a two-edged sword and where
[43:35] does it cut to
[43:37] it even defy divides asunder the spirit
[43:42] and the soul
[43:43] and then he goes on to say the joints
[43:45] and the marrow which are parts of the
[43:46] body and and and so on
[43:49] but many people out there there's an
[43:52] anointing available for anybody that
[43:53] wants it he said my spirit will be
[43:55] poured out on a double l all flesh
[43:59] anybody everywhere
[44:01] has access to the spirit of god in this
[44:04] day and age
[44:06] that's why the message anointed ones at
[44:08] the end time become so important
[44:11] i remember brother sandy beach i don't
[44:13] think i mentioned this last time but we
[44:14] were in panama a few years back
[44:16] and we were
[44:18] he uh
[44:19] we'd been talking a little bit about
[44:20] anointing and so on and
[44:22] when we got back to the little hotel
[44:24] room we had he
[44:26] had some music on oh my it's beautiful
[44:29] anointed beautiful music oh my
[44:32] and i'm standing about from here
[44:35] brother trevor there i'm going to see
[44:37] andy that's
[44:38] that is really anointed music he said
[44:40] yeah i know it's pretty isn't it and i
[44:42] said yeah and he said come and look at
[44:44] this and he turns the computer around
[44:46] you should have seen the people that
[44:47] were singing it
[44:49] they had them funny shoes on
[44:52] and then little skirts and the hair no
[44:54] hair
[44:55] and you know and so on and the guys were
[44:57] you know had i don't know
[45:00] it was a mess
[45:02] so we realize
[45:05] anybody that wants to come under that
[45:07] anointing can do it
[45:10] in fact it's so powerful that even some
[45:12] people that don't realize it that's why
[45:14] we go to we look at hollywood brother
[45:15] branham said all
[45:18] inspiration is of god but what they do
[45:20] with it
[45:21] depends on
[45:23] where they're going and what side
[45:24] they're on and that's why you see things
[45:26] like you know terrible judgments and
[45:28] earthquakes and bombs and wars and rapes
[45:31] and all kinds of those things in the
[45:32] movies because that's what's in their
[45:34] heart
[45:36] but they are bringing that forth to
[45:38] reveal
[45:40] what's in them
[45:42] and they take an inspiration from god
[45:46] and then they express it in that way
[45:48] through those movies and all those
[45:50] things
[45:51] and we begin to realize
[45:54] it's
[45:55] false christ
[45:58] it's a genuine absolute true anointing
[46:00] of the word of god
[46:02] or or the spirit of god that it doesn't
[46:05] carry the soul of god with it
[46:07] and the holy spirit is given to us to
[46:10] sharper than a two-edged sword to divide
[46:13] between the spirit
[46:15] and the soul
[46:17] brother branham said the soul is becomes
[46:19] the nature of the spirit he said
[46:22] it's the soul is the nature of the
[46:24] spirit so when you realize that
[46:27] it's not just the anointing that we come
[46:30] for as christians
[46:32] but we want to have the nature
[46:36] behind that holy spirit
[46:39] and the nature
[46:41] is this
[46:43] it is
[46:45] the word of god
[46:46] is the nature of god
[46:48] expressed
[46:51] and so he uses this scripture
[46:54] we realize that the holy spirit is given
[46:57] to us so that we can discern
[47:00] the difference between just an anointing
[47:05] and having the nature of jesus christ
[47:08] it divides between the spirit and the
[47:11] soul so that when we come up to
[47:13] something maybe it's a you know i've
[47:15] been a few churches where oh my i was
[47:16] anointed but when you you know the guy
[47:19] started preaching i'm going how do i get
[47:21] out of this place
[47:23] because it didn't have the nature of
[47:25] this
[47:26] it had a some kind of a denominational
[47:29] thing or something else or that spirit
[47:31] of man had attached itself to that holy
[47:34] ghost
[47:35] and he was given man's doctrines man's
[47:37] dogmas
[47:38] or look at me i'm the great guy
[47:41] i'm not the great guy jesus christ is
[47:44] and if people you know i heard a guy
[47:47] i hate to say this but claim to be in
[47:49] the message of the hour a few years ago
[47:52] and uh but he came up with a certain
[47:54] revelation he said if you don't have
[47:55] this revelation you can't go in the
[47:57] rapture
[47:58] sorry friend you're antichrist
[48:01] because of anything but if it takes
[48:02] anything besides the blood and the power
[48:04] of jesus christ
[48:06] that's the antichrist
[48:08] it only takes jesus christ in the form
[48:11] of the word living in me amen and it
[48:13] doesn't take some special revelation of
[48:15] yours
[48:17] for me to get there and if you're
[48:18] standing between me and jesus christ
[48:21] you're an idol
[48:23] it's antichrist stay
[48:25] with the word stay with the nature of
[48:29] the word
[48:31] and
[48:32] so as we look at that and then we go
[48:35] back to psalms
[48:38] where
[48:40] we've just read and he's talking there
[48:42] about calvary and the nature of god
[48:44] and then he makes that statement in what
[48:50] i better take this little thing if i
[48:52] keep jumping back and forth i'll
[48:55] spend half the night looking for it
[48:57] there we go
[48:58] he said deliver my soul from the sword
[49:03] and then he has the two little dots so
[49:05] you know that after that sir there's a
[49:06] time spring a time frame
[49:09] brother branham said those two dots and
[49:10] he mentioned a place or two where you
[49:13] know he said there's two thousand years
[49:14] between those two little dots
[49:17] so you have deliver my soul from the
[49:19] sword
[49:20] well and like i said i tend to think of
[49:22] it as uh
[49:24] trying to keep you know from getting
[49:25] killed by the sword
[49:27] and such but when we're talking about
[49:30] the sword it said you know he said the
[49:32] word of god is powerful like a two-edged
[49:35] sword and then in
[49:39] revelations 1 and chapter 6 he makes
[49:42] another
[49:43] interesting statement about the sword
[49:49] i get that oh 116 i think it is yeah no
[49:53] that can't be right
[49:55] i wrote it down wrong
[49:57] but it says that out of his mouth
[49:59] proceeds a two-edged sword
[50:02] um oh i'm in first john no wonder i
[50:04] can't find it
[50:06] praise the lord see these glasses are
[50:08] getting all scratched up my wife and i
[50:10] keep talking about getting new ones and
[50:13] well
[50:15] praise the lord the doctor told me my
[50:17] arms has just grown too short
[50:21] but
[50:24] yes one and verse 16 and and he had in
[50:27] his right hand seven stars and out of
[50:29] his mouth when a two-edged sword and his
[50:32] countenance was as the sun shineth in
[50:34] his strength and when i saw him i fell
[50:37] at his feet as dead and he laid his
[50:39] right hand upon me saying fear not i am
[50:41] the first
[50:43] and the last.
[50:45] and so
[50:46] we see
[50:47] a different sword
[50:50] he said when i saw him when john
[50:53] you know i know it says there in the
[50:54] caption at the top of the book of
[50:56] revelation that says you know the
[50:58] revelation of john it's not the
[50:59] revelation of john because in the first
[51:02] verse i said it's the revelation of
[51:04] jesus christ
[51:06] it's the revelation that jesus christ
[51:08] got after the birth life death of burial
[51:10] and resurrection and the ascension
[51:13] jesus now returns to john
[51:17] as an ascended god in a vision
[51:20] and says okay this is my revelation john
[51:22] or the revelation of me
[51:26] depending on how you view it and so here
[51:29] is john looking at this and he said i
[51:31] fell at his feet as dead
[51:33] and so on
[51:34] but it says that out of his mouth
[51:36] proceeded like you know a two-edged
[51:39] sword yes one back there we go and so
[51:42] this sword when he said deliver
[51:46] my soul
[51:47] from the sword
[51:49] compound meaning compound revelation
[51:53] what are we talking about what every
[51:55] scripture points us to jesus christ he's
[51:58] just described himself
[52:00] going to calvary in
[52:02] spirit or prophecy form
[52:05] through the psalmist david and he comes
[52:07] down and he gives us all those details
[52:09] and then he comes to that verse and said
[52:11] deliver my soul from the sword
[52:16] what is going on with that
[52:19] he has just explained to us
[52:22] by way of the sword out of his mouth
[52:26] what the soul of god was all about
[52:30] i am poured out like water all my bones
[52:32] are out of joint and they gaped upon me
[52:35] with their mouths all of those things
[52:36] are describing the soul of god the
[52:41] nature of god concerning us
[52:44] for salvation
[52:46] and when he says deliver me from the
[52:49] sword
[52:51] let the sword of this word deliver to us
[52:55] the soul
[52:57] of jesus christ
[53:02] are you with me
[53:04] some strange looks out there
[53:08] it's the word of god and he's saying
[53:10] deliver my soul
[53:13] from the sword
[53:14] deliver to the people from this sword
[53:18] what my soul is
[53:21] what my nature is
[53:23] deliver it
[53:25] i got that stuck in there funniness
[53:29] deliver my soul
[53:31] from the sword
[53:34] so praise the lord
[53:36] and we begin to see and he said you know
[53:38] the out of his mouth goes a sharp
[53:40] two-edged sword he begins to explain it
[53:43] and from that where he says that in
[53:46] verse 16 he continues
[53:51] well for one thing the next thing that
[53:53] happens he says you know i i when i saw
[53:55] him i fell at his feet as dead man
[53:58] who's the resurrection in the life
[54:01] jesus christ
[54:02] and when john falls as a dead man what's
[54:05] the nature that we see from this sword
[54:08] that came out of his mouth
[54:10] here have some resurrection john
[54:14] it's the nature
[54:16] of god
[54:17] expressed
[54:19] by the sword
[54:21] of the word
[54:24] and he also says on him it says he laid
[54:26] his right hand on me saying fear not
[54:29] i'm the first
[54:30] and the last.
[54:32] we read you know another place he said
[54:34] in fact back in verse 8 he said i am the
[54:37] alpha and the omega the beginning the
[54:39] ending
[54:41] the lord which is which was
[54:43] and which is to come the almighty the
[54:45] same yesterday today and forever
[54:48] out of hebrews 13 8.
[54:51] what are we seeing from the sword of the
[54:54] word he is delivering to us the nature
[54:59] of jesus christ
[55:02] he's placing in the bride of jesus
[55:05] christ by his word his own nature
[55:09] brother branham said
[55:10] the bride
[55:12] and the husband are one
[55:16] we go back and they became one flesh
[55:19] another place it says in the scripture
[55:22] when we read in let's in fact let's look
[55:23] at john i hadn't planned to go there but
[55:25] it's a good one to look at
[55:28] get skipped over a lot
[55:30] from what i've
[55:31] seen john the first chapter we know how
[55:33] it starts out i'm the beginning was the
[55:35] word word was with god the word was god
[55:37] same in the beginning with god so on all
[55:40] things were made by him he's the life
[55:42] he's the light of man so on and coming
[55:44] down
[55:44] and then a lot of times we'll drop down
[55:46] almost
[55:47] you know many times to verse 14 and the
[55:50] word was made flesh and dwelt among us
[55:52] we beheld his glory as the only god
[55:54] begotten of the father full of grace and
[55:56] truth
[55:57] but we just skipped
[55:59] verse 12.
[56:03] and verse 12 says but as many as
[56:05] received him
[56:08] to them gave he power to become the sons
[56:11] of god even to them that believe on his
[56:13] name
[56:14] to as many as believed him
[56:16] well i just told you in the first verse
[56:18] he's the word
[56:21] he's the word and we know that he's also
[56:24] brings with him that anointing that
[56:26] spirit of the holy ghost
[56:28] that's what he poured back after he
[56:30] ascended if i don't go away disciples
[56:33] uh it's best that i go away because if i
[56:35] don't go away i can't send the holy
[56:37] ghost back to you which is jesus the
[56:39] same jesus christ in a different form
[56:41] the form of the holy ghost and in that
[56:44] form of the holy ghost what do we see
[56:46] begin to be manifested the nature of
[56:50] jesus christ
[56:52] with your receiving of jesus christ
[56:56] comes in nature just the same way as
[56:59] drinking this water gives me the life
[57:01] that's in the water
[57:03] jesus told the woman at the well
[57:06] hey give me a drink she says you got
[57:07] nothing to draw with
[57:09] and the world's deep he said but if you
[57:11] knew who you were talking to do you know
[57:13] who we're talking to
[57:16] remember what he asked peter who do men
[57:18] say that i am
[57:19] jesus said well you're the christ the
[57:21] son of the living god who do we say that
[57:23] he is
[57:25] he's the life the truth the way he is
[57:28] the word of god
[57:30] he is god the manifest nature of
[57:33] almighty god through jesus christ
[57:36] through the word of god
[57:39] when you drink of this word we drink of
[57:42] the nature of jesus christ
[57:46] and in verse 12
[57:48] he says as many as received him that's a
[57:51] personal presence of jesus christ
[57:55] there's a doctrine out there they call
[57:56] it perugia it's an absolute true
[57:59] doctrine
[58:01] but it's not a doctrine it's the
[58:03] personal presence of jesus christ in my
[58:06] life
[58:07] in your life
[58:09] it's not just a doctrine i don't care
[58:11] what they tell you it's the personal
[58:14] expression that you have with jesus
[58:16] christ who do you say that he is
[58:19] he's my life he's my everything
[58:22] without him i have nothing without him
[58:24] there was nothing of me even created
[58:27] except he creates it and how does he
[58:29] create
[58:30] ask what you will
[58:36] as many as received him
[58:38] what did he do
[58:41] to them that's the ones of us that
[58:43] received him
[58:44] he gave power
[58:47] power
[58:48] to become the sons of god
[58:51] to them that believe
[58:53] on his name and brother branham said the
[58:55] name
[58:56] and the word
[58:57] are the same thing
[59:01] so how do you receive power
[59:03] we sing about old power
[59:05] oh lord let the power do
[59:08] you know what are we actually singing
[59:10] about
[59:11] i want to receive him
[59:14] the fullness
[59:15] of the nature
[59:17] of god
[59:18] that he had prepared for me and for you
[59:22] before the foundation of the world
[59:23] before there was a world before there
[59:25] was even time
[59:28] we say we have eternal life
[59:30] eternal life had no beginning
[59:33] it had no ending
[59:37] it's god
[59:40] and it's the life of god that we receive
[59:43] when we receive him
[59:45] that power
[59:46] to become sons of god
[59:50] to them that believe on his name
[59:52] i believe him
[59:54] i don't always look like it
[59:56] if you're looking at this stuff
[59:59] this is dirt man
[1:00:01] this dirt came out of an unregented
[1:00:03] rated world this world has not been
[1:00:05] regenerated it has not received its
[1:00:07] fiery holy ghost baptism
[1:00:09] it received water baptism
[1:00:11] when they you know in the days of noah
[1:00:14] typified when the children went through
[1:00:16] the red sea
[1:00:18] but it takes this world has to have a
[1:00:20] fiery baptism too
[1:00:27] heavens and earth will pass away
[1:00:29] but my word will never pass
[1:00:31] it can't
[1:00:33] because it has received the power
[1:00:35] to become the sons and daughters of god
[1:00:37] which are eternal creatures
[1:00:40] this bible tells us
[1:00:42] so we see
[1:00:46] the word of god and we see the nature
[1:00:48] of god
[1:00:50] and if we understand the nature of god
[1:00:53] as i understand it
[1:00:55] then he gives us certain promises
[1:00:58] and with those promises
[1:01:00] there are
[1:01:02] benefits
[1:01:04] that
[1:01:05] the world has no clue even what we're
[1:01:07] talking about
[1:01:09] i run into people now and then and they
[1:01:12] you know they know certain quotes random
[1:01:14] talked about the spoken word
[1:01:16] and you know he preached
[1:01:18] spoken word as the original seed and
[1:01:21] uh
[1:01:22] some other messages and things along
[1:01:24] that side those those things and
[1:01:27] uh
[1:01:29] i i heard somebody it's been a few years
[1:01:31] back now and they said oh when the
[1:01:32] spoken word gets here it's going to be
[1:01:34] so world so wonderful and
[1:01:37] i said where in the world have you been
[1:01:41] my kids are using the spoken word and
[1:01:43] they know they're using the spoken word
[1:01:46] and i i think of the testimony of my you
[1:01:49] know michelle i think most many of you
[1:01:51] know her and how that they said she
[1:01:53] could never had children they'd been
[1:01:54] married seven years they said no way not
[1:01:57] going to happen they said she had a
[1:01:58] growth inside of her under i think on
[1:02:00] her ovaries or something and they wanted
[1:02:02] to do surgery and she calls up
[1:02:04] we were living over in elkton there at
[1:02:06] the time i was cutting logs on the coast
[1:02:08] and jonathan was helping me cut some
[1:02:09] logs and
[1:02:10] he was there and
[1:02:12] she was all shook up because they wanted
[1:02:14] to go and do surgery
[1:02:17] and
[1:02:18] we're listening you know and i as you
[1:02:20] know the dad i said well we'll we'll be
[1:02:22] praying and stuff and
[1:02:24] and i said don't worry about it god can
[1:02:26] take care of his stuff
[1:02:27] jonathan takes the phone he says
[1:02:29] michelle how do you want it
[1:02:33] and she goes what and he goes how do you
[1:02:35] want it speak it
[1:02:37] so michelle speaking now
[1:02:39] says
[1:02:40] i want to go through with the surgery
[1:02:43] but when they get in there i want them
[1:02:45] to find nothing there and when it's over
[1:02:48] i want them to tell me there's no reason
[1:02:50] i can't have children
[1:02:52] it happened exactly
[1:02:54] as she spoke it the next day
[1:02:57] she went in for the surgery the doctors
[1:03:00] got angry
[1:03:02] because they're looking at all these
[1:03:04] x-rays
[1:03:06] and they're going there's nothing there
[1:03:08] they thought somebody gave them the
[1:03:09] wrong x-rays
[1:03:11] because these aren't right
[1:03:13] there's nothing there
[1:03:15] and then they told her there's no reason
[1:03:18] you can't have children well we got
[1:03:20] matthew now from that one
[1:03:25] you know praise the lord
[1:03:27] what was it
[1:03:30] we're praying
[1:03:32] under the spirit
[1:03:34] jonathan says speak
[1:03:36] she spoke
[1:03:39] a son of god to a daughter of god she
[1:03:41] spoke what she wanted and jesus christ
[1:03:43] backed up their words
[1:03:46] amen your words
[1:03:49] it's been going on
[1:03:52] time after time after time
[1:03:55] i've seen it
[1:03:57] but i'm not here
[1:03:59] you know to just
[1:04:00] testimony service but i've seen it
[1:04:02] happen so many times
[1:04:05] it's amazing and sometimes without us
[1:04:07] even knowing i'll give one more quick
[1:04:09] when i was leaving mauritius the island
[1:04:11] there we'd been over on madagascar and
[1:04:13] i'm getting ready to go home from
[1:04:14] mauritius and
[1:04:15] preach to service and you know still
[1:04:17] kind of under the anointing and stuff
[1:04:19] and i i get kind of loopy i don't know
[1:04:21] how
[1:04:22] you know paul and david handle it
[1:04:25] her brother there in the back but
[1:04:30] i
[1:04:30] like to pray or
[1:04:32] believe god until i see it but it's not
[1:04:34] a vision i can't explain it to you but
[1:04:36] it's in front of me now
[1:04:38] and then i just tell you what i see
[1:04:40] in here
[1:04:42] and so i'm kind of
[1:04:44] you know and all these people are there
[1:04:45] wanting to uh you know hug you and ask
[1:04:48] all these questions and you know the
[1:04:49] french they're doing the two kiss thing
[1:04:51] and and i'm like whoa whoa i'm bumping
[1:04:53] noses with these guys because
[1:04:58] the the spanish they like to shake your
[1:05:00] hand twice once on each side and these
[1:05:02] guys like to do that so i you know
[1:05:04] bumped my face a couple times and
[1:05:06] they're kind of laughing at me and
[1:05:08] they're asking well you know where you
[1:05:09] know how are you going home or whatever
[1:05:11] well actually i had a really complicated
[1:05:13] set of tickets for that trip home
[1:05:16] and
[1:05:18] i explained it to the first one i go
[1:05:20] from mauritius to dubai to london to
[1:05:23] new york
[1:05:24] to new jersey to salt lake to seattle
[1:05:28] how do you explain that
[1:05:30] quickly in a line when people are going
[1:05:32] like this and about every third one is
[1:05:34] asking you how are you going home
[1:05:37] so i just said
[1:05:40] i go to new york to seattle
[1:05:45] that's just me
[1:05:46] because i'm tired and i'm bumping noses
[1:05:49] and
[1:05:52] you know that's what came out of my
[1:05:53] mouth right so well
[1:05:56] it sort of happened like that
[1:05:58] because i went you know i did the first
[1:06:00] leg i think i might have said london new
[1:06:02] york at home but
[1:06:04] anyway so i get to new york
[1:06:07] get on the taxi cab because the next
[1:06:09] flight was out of
[1:06:11] new jersey i get down there slept in the
[1:06:14] airport that night because it was an
[1:06:16] early flight
[1:06:17] and
[1:06:19] the next flight to salt lake is i'm
[1:06:21] getting ready to go up to the counter
[1:06:22] they pull it
[1:06:26] i'm going
[1:06:27] uh
[1:06:28] what happened to that flight
[1:06:30] and the guy goes you were supposed to be
[1:06:31] on that flight and i said yeah yeah yeah
[1:06:34] i had to make my connection to seattle
[1:06:36] and he goes oh no he was ah the plane
[1:06:39] had
[1:06:40] something went wrong with it sitting out
[1:06:41] on the runway and they're not gonna fly
[1:06:43] it so he'd
[1:06:47] here
[1:06:48] have a ticket
[1:06:49] here here's a ticket to ride the taxi
[1:06:52] cab back to new york
[1:06:56] and fly home direct to seattle which is
[1:06:58] what i said new york to seattle
[1:07:02] well it never had occurred to me this is
[1:07:04] what i spoke
[1:07:06] because you know
[1:07:08] i'm like
[1:07:10] and so i get there well one more little
[1:07:12] piece here when i was getting off the
[1:07:14] plane the first time coming in from
[1:07:16] london
[1:07:18] i was you know i walked through first
[1:07:20] class
[1:07:21] i'm going wow this is this looks really
[1:07:24] nice
[1:07:26] but i can't do that to people
[1:07:29] you know i mean your brother branham
[1:07:31] said it's the nickels and the dimes and
[1:07:32] the things that the people put in the
[1:07:34] offering that make the meaning
[1:07:35] successful
[1:07:36] i never could bring myself to get a
[1:07:38] first class ticket
[1:07:40] but i thought just a thought you know
[1:07:42] just thinking wow that might would be
[1:07:44] nice sometime right
[1:07:46] so now
[1:07:47] taxi cab back to new york
[1:07:50] and when i go to get on the airplane he
[1:07:52] said oh as i was leaving new jersey he
[1:07:54] said by the way i bumped you to first
[1:07:56] class
[1:07:58] for your trouble
[1:08:00] i'm going first class
[1:08:07] i mean i know paul understands he's
[1:08:09] walked through there too
[1:08:10] [Laughter]
[1:08:12] so i get there and sure enough i just
[1:08:15] barely made it in time and we got on the
[1:08:17] airplane here i am in first class and
[1:08:19] flew to seattle and i don't recommend it
[1:08:22] because every 50 i was so tired i just
[1:08:24] wanted to sleep and every 10 minutes
[1:08:26] they're they're asking if you want
[1:08:27] something
[1:08:31] i just wanted to go to sleep i tried to
[1:08:34] sleep so but and i didn't even realize
[1:08:37] until i'm getting off the airplane in
[1:08:39] seattle and i'm looking back going you
[1:08:41] know what just happened here
[1:08:43] and i'm going to something just said did
[1:08:45] not you say
[1:08:47] did not you say
[1:08:49] you were going to go there to there to
[1:08:52] there
[1:08:54] and i said i did
[1:08:55] and did not you want to see what first
[1:08:58] class was
[1:09:01] well
[1:09:03] praise the lord and people say they're
[1:09:05] waiting for the spoken word
[1:09:08] it's been here ever since the day that
[1:09:09] the the angel of the lord told the
[1:09:11] brother branham sister hattie wright
[1:09:14] a sister represents a church
[1:09:17] and the
[1:09:18] spoken words on the prophet he said tell
[1:09:20] her what she says she can have it and
[1:09:23] that anointing moved on to that
[1:09:25] church
[1:09:27] and it's been here ever since
[1:09:29] for those that can believe it
[1:09:31] and use it accordingly
[1:09:35] so
[1:09:36] the nature
[1:09:37] of god he trusts us so much
[1:09:41] with his divine nature that you're not
[1:09:43] going to ask for something that
[1:09:45] is harmful or hurtful
[1:09:48] we will only ask the things
[1:09:51] that are pleasing to the lord
[1:09:56] we need one more shot of this
[1:09:58] praise the lord so those things being
[1:10:01] said
[1:10:06] let's take a look at
[1:10:10] first samuel
[1:10:11] chapter 21.
[1:10:14] we're talking about
[1:10:16] the nature of god
[1:10:19] expressed by the word of god or from the
[1:10:21] mouth of god
[1:10:23] or from the
[1:10:24] sword of god
[1:10:28] in first samuel
[1:10:30] chapter 21
[1:10:32] and i'm sure you've read this it's a
[1:10:35] wonderful
[1:10:36] stretch of scripture
[1:10:38] and at this point david is running from
[1:10:40] saul
[1:10:43] scared for his life
[1:10:46] your next anointed king and he's scared
[1:10:50] it's okay to be scared
[1:10:53] you know with all the kovids and all the
[1:10:55] other nonsense going on in the world
[1:10:56] it's okay to be scared
[1:10:58] david's an anointed king
[1:11:01] and he's scared
[1:11:03] he's running for his life
[1:11:06] and he gets down here to the high priest
[1:11:08] or to the priest it says then david 21
[1:11:11] verse 1 then david k
[1:11:14] then came david to knob to him elect the
[1:11:16] priest and himelec was afraid to meet of
[1:11:18] the meeting of david and said unto him
[1:11:20] why art thou alone and no man with thee
[1:11:23] not only david is afraid
[1:11:25] so is the priest what are you
[1:11:28] doing here
[1:11:31] by yourself because he knew that you
[1:11:33] know david had armies of guys and stuff
[1:11:36] around him all the time right
[1:11:39] so he says uh
[1:11:41] david says to him like the priest the
[1:11:43] king hath commanded me a business and
[1:11:45] hath said unto me let no man know
[1:11:47] anything of this business whereabout i
[1:11:48] send thee and what have i commanded thee
[1:11:51] and i have appointed my servants to such
[1:11:52] and such a place did david just lie to
[1:11:55] him
[1:11:56] is that
[1:11:57] how we're reading this
[1:11:59] the king
[1:12:01] had commanded me in business
[1:12:06] no saul's trying to kill him
[1:12:09] and so if you read it from a natural
[1:12:11] standpoint
[1:12:13] david just slide to the priest
[1:12:16] that's not
[1:12:17] something you should really be
[1:12:20] doing i'm serious you know you don't go
[1:12:23] and lie to the pastor
[1:12:25] hey brother paul by the way
[1:12:30] no
[1:12:32] but what if you read it compound meaning
[1:12:35] compound revelation
[1:12:37] what king is he talking about
[1:12:40] because you go back to
[1:12:43] samuel i think it's 17 was where he's
[1:12:45] anointed maybe it's
[1:12:47] yeah i think it's 17 you know verse or
[1:12:49] chapter 16
[1:12:51] he says and the lord said unto samuel
[1:12:53] how long will thou mourn for saul seeing
[1:12:55] i have rejected him from reigning over
[1:12:57] israel god's mind
[1:12:59] salt
[1:13:00] salt's not the king anymore
[1:13:02] and he says uh
[1:13:04] fill thy horn with oil goes i send thee
[1:13:06] to jesse the beth might for i have
[1:13:08] provided me
[1:13:10] a king
[1:13:12] among the sons
[1:13:14] who's going to be the king
[1:13:18] who's me
[1:13:20] who's the me that's talking through
[1:13:22] samuel
[1:13:24] god is going to provide himself
[1:13:28] as a king
[1:13:30] out of those sons of samuel so who is
[1:13:33] going to express himself
[1:13:36] his nature
[1:13:38] through who through whoever becomes king
[1:13:43] god himself
[1:13:47] provided me
[1:13:49] a king
[1:13:50] and that's the word of the lord and the
[1:13:52] word of the lord comes to samuel
[1:13:54] even says the word of the lord comes to
[1:13:56] samuel and in fact back in chapter 3 i
[1:13:59] think it is where samuel says the word
[1:14:01] of the lord was revealed to samuel in
[1:14:04] shiloh that's how samuel received god
[1:14:08] was by the word now the word comes and
[1:14:10] says i'm going to make me a king
[1:14:13] among those sons
[1:14:15] well we know what happened
[1:14:17] rejected rejected rejected
[1:14:21] samuel had a little trial i'm sure
[1:14:23] wait a minute i know god sent me here
[1:14:28] and they've all been rejected
[1:14:30] and he had a devil just like we did
[1:14:32] trying to
[1:14:34] ha-ha samuel you just thought you heard
[1:14:36] from the lord
[1:14:39] jesse don't you have one more
[1:14:42] yeah i got one more but he's out with
[1:14:44] the sheep man
[1:14:46] no foot whoosh flunky david was the foot
[1:14:49] wish lucky
[1:14:50] and he comes in you don't smell good he
[1:14:52] doesn't look good
[1:14:54] his brothers are going our little
[1:14:56] brother
[1:14:57] hey they had flesh too
[1:14:59] they weren't all great super spiritual
[1:15:01] giants and they're looking
[1:15:03] our little brother
[1:15:05] the one in the sheepskins
[1:15:08] and the dirty feet
[1:15:10] and the
[1:15:12] but god looks at something different
[1:15:15] because he wants to be king and this is
[1:15:17] the one
[1:15:19] that can provide me
[1:15:22] as a king how many times you expose
[1:15:24] through scripture we look at king david
[1:15:27] and see jesus christ
[1:15:29] over and over and over and over
[1:15:33] we can look at the life of david and see
[1:15:35] jesus christ even when he fell with
[1:15:38] bathsheba number one bathsheba means i
[1:15:41] believe it's the
[1:15:42] we mentioned it last time
[1:15:44] the daughter of the promise or the
[1:15:46] daughter of the oath i think it is
[1:15:53] and even david when he goes up on that
[1:15:55] rock because he loses his kingdom
[1:15:57] because of adultery
[1:15:58] jesus christ swept on the same rock
[1:16:02] because the sin of adultery in the
[1:16:03] garden of eden
[1:16:05] even in his sin
[1:16:08] we can see jesus christ in david
[1:16:11] because the bible said jesus christ
[1:16:13] became sin
[1:16:15] for you and i
[1:16:19] we're talking about delivering the soul
[1:16:23] by from the sword
[1:16:25] so the word
[1:16:26] or the sword of the lord we can look
[1:16:29] into these words
[1:16:30] and see the life of jesus christ
[1:16:33] over and over as god is showing himself
[1:16:38] as a king
[1:16:40] we know that
[1:16:43] well let's just read on a little bit
[1:16:44] there from verse 21 and i'll close so
[1:16:46] you can get home and david said unto him
[1:16:48] like okay uh
[1:16:51] pick it up there verse three he said now
[1:16:52] therefore what is under thine hand give
[1:16:54] me five loaves of bread in my hand and
[1:16:57] and what the
[1:16:58] or what there is present the priest
[1:17:01] answers david and said there's no common
[1:17:02] bread under my hand but there is
[1:17:04] hallowed bread if these young men have
[1:17:06] kept themselves there is a little space
[1:17:08] of time in between there so apparently a
[1:17:10] few men of davids have showed up too
[1:17:12] because he said if the young men have
[1:17:14] kept themselves
[1:17:16] uh at least from the women
[1:17:18] david answered and uh
[1:17:20] said unto him of truth these have been
[1:17:23] kept from about these three days and i
[1:17:25] came out the vessels the young men are
[1:17:26] holy and the bread is a manner of
[1:17:28] communion so we're just kind of going
[1:17:29] through this sequence
[1:17:31] of how
[1:17:33] the priest
[1:17:35] gives priestly bread
[1:17:38] to david
[1:17:39] okay that's what's happening here
[1:17:41] and it
[1:17:42] said as sanctified this day in the
[1:17:45] vessel so the priest gives him the
[1:17:47] hallowed bread and there was no bread
[1:17:49] there in the except the shoe bread and
[1:17:51] that was taken before the lord put in
[1:17:53] the hot bread that day was taken away
[1:17:55] so what
[1:17:57] just happened david is a king
[1:18:01] shouldn't be eating the shoe bread he
[1:18:03] tells him this is only for the priests
[1:18:07] but even though it appears that david
[1:18:09] lied to him the king is expressing him
[1:18:13] through itself through david
[1:18:16] and he is the high priest
[1:18:18] so the priest gives
[1:18:20] the bread of the high priest
[1:18:23] to the priest that's in david
[1:18:28] and jesus the night that he was be
[1:18:30] prayed he took bread and he broke it
[1:18:33] and said this is my body which is broken
[1:18:36] for you
[1:18:37] and so we have the priest giving the
[1:18:40] bread
[1:18:43] to david
[1:18:45] the bread of the pre and it actually
[1:18:46] cost this priest his life when saul
[1:18:48] found out about it
[1:18:51] i think it's a little later verse or
[1:18:53] chapter 23 or 27 i don't remember but so
[1:18:59] he comes to there and uh
[1:19:02] and it mentions that there's a servant
[1:19:03] of saul there dog the edomite
[1:19:06] chief of the herd and so on and he sees
[1:19:08] it happen that's how saul finds out
[1:19:10] later but in verse eight and david said
[1:19:12] in a himalaya
[1:19:14] that there is
[1:19:15] is there not here under thy hand a spear
[1:19:18] or a sword i have neither brought my
[1:19:20] sword nor my weapons with because the
[1:19:22] king's business required haste
[1:19:26] now what king is he talking about
[1:19:30] him
[1:19:32] his business because saul's been
[1:19:34] rejected and now he is officially king
[1:19:37] even though he's running for his life
[1:19:40] and he said i had to get here and hurry
[1:19:42] i didn't bring any weapons with me
[1:19:44] and so
[1:19:45] you don't normally go to church or to
[1:19:47] the priest to find your weapons i don't
[1:19:50] think
[1:19:52] no nothing under there brother paul
[1:19:56] yeah the weapons of our warfare those
[1:19:58] kinds are all right
[1:20:00] and so
[1:20:02] he says
[1:20:04] and the priest says the sword of goliath
[1:20:07] the philistine whom thus slew in the
[1:20:09] valley of ela behold it is here wrapped
[1:20:11] in a cloth behind the ephod if thou will
[1:20:14] take that take it
[1:20:15] for there is no other save that one here
[1:20:19] watch what david says
[1:20:22] there's not that's the only one that's
[1:20:24] here there's none other one save that
[1:20:26] one and david said there's none like it
[1:20:30] none like that give it to me
[1:20:35] give it to me
[1:20:37] well for one thing where is it i don't i
[1:20:39] didn't wear a coat tonight it's
[1:20:41] wednesday right but if i had my coat i'd
[1:20:43] hang it here on the front
[1:20:45] and say okay this is the ephod
[1:20:48] hanging on the front of the altar
[1:20:51] and the arm and thumb and then would go
[1:20:53] on the front of the ephod
[1:20:55] on the breastplate
[1:20:57] and behind that is the altar
[1:21:00] now he just tells
[1:21:03] david
[1:21:06] that's the only one here
[1:21:08] david says there's none like it give it
[1:21:10] to me
[1:21:11] but he says it's wrapped
[1:21:13] in a cloth
[1:21:14] behind the ephod
[1:21:19] if that will take it
[1:21:21] so
[1:21:22] if the ephod's hanging on the altar
[1:21:27] and the sword is behind the ephod
[1:21:31] under the altar
[1:21:33] and he pulls it out
[1:21:36] and the priest
[1:21:38] hands it to david
[1:21:40] and he said it's wrapped
[1:21:42] it's wrapped here in a cloth
[1:21:44] behind the ephod
[1:21:48] take it
[1:21:50] and he pulls it out from behind the
[1:21:52] altar he hands it
[1:21:53] to david
[1:21:54] now we know that david has called a man
[1:21:56] after god's own heart
[1:21:58] he wants the heart of god in him
[1:22:02] he wants to have god's heart manifest
[1:22:04] for in fact
[1:22:06] i think it's in the book of acts when
[1:22:07] stephen is about to get stoned he
[1:22:09] mentions it
[1:22:11] and how that
[1:22:13] if it's not stephen anyway it's in the
[1:22:15] book of acts go look at that
[1:22:17] you ever forget stuff brother
[1:22:21] i just know it's in the book of acts
[1:22:23] but
[1:22:24] and how that he wants to have the heart
[1:22:28] of god now he got this sword
[1:22:32] by killing goliath
[1:22:34] and we know that after he killed
[1:22:36] goliath he took
[1:22:39] that same sword
[1:22:40] and severed goliath's head right
[1:22:43] remember that part
[1:22:46] which we know is a direct
[1:22:49] well
[1:22:51] let's go to genesis you said you're not
[1:22:53] in a hurry genesis chapter 49
[1:22:57] when he's speaking here this is jacob
[1:23:00] speaking to
[1:23:02] his sons by way of prophecy
[1:23:05] 49 verse 8
[1:23:08] judah thou art he
[1:23:10] whom thy brethren shalt so 49 verse 8
[1:23:13] there we are
[1:23:15] thou art he whom thy brethren shall
[1:23:17] praise thy hand shall be in the neck of
[1:23:19] thine enemies thy father's children
[1:23:20] shall bow down before thee that's the
[1:23:23] prophecy
[1:23:24] to judah it continues on about the lion
[1:23:26] of the tribe of judah but this
[1:23:28] particular prophecy
[1:23:31] brother adam told us this stuff isn't in
[1:23:34] chronological order
[1:23:36] in fact god will say something here and
[1:23:38] then he says something over here and
[1:23:40] it's actually
[1:23:41] maybe this way
[1:23:43] and so he says and this is a prophecy
[1:23:46] who so who's speaking well it's
[1:23:49] jacob right
[1:23:50] no it's god
[1:23:52] speaking through jacob because it's a
[1:23:54] prophecy and it's in the book
[1:23:56] judah
[1:23:57] so he's this is prophecy
[1:23:59] the nature of god is being expressed
[1:24:03] into judah
[1:24:05] in the beginning god created that's his
[1:24:08] personality that's his nature and so now
[1:24:11] god speaking to judah
[1:24:13] tells him
[1:24:14] thou art he those who thy brother thy
[1:24:17] brothers shall praise
[1:24:19] did they praise david
[1:24:22] after he killed goliath
[1:24:26] saul killed his thousands and david
[1:24:28] killed his ten thousands and which
[1:24:32] saul didn't like it actually
[1:24:35] and so
[1:24:36] what do we see
[1:24:38] they david could have said that day this
[1:24:40] day the scripture is fulfilled before
[1:24:43] your eyes
[1:24:45] but then it continues
[1:24:47] not
[1:24:48] necessarily in order thy hand shall be
[1:24:50] in the neck of thine enemies when you
[1:24:52] look this actually up it means to sever
[1:24:55] the head of the enemy it's not talking
[1:24:57] about a nice massage
[1:25:00] or even holding them by the back of the
[1:25:01] neck it means you're cutting the head
[1:25:03] off of thine enemies
[1:25:06] when david took the sword
[1:25:10] this day
[1:25:11] this scripture's fulfilled
[1:25:14] and my father's
[1:25:15] children shall bow down before thee and
[1:25:18] you go over into chronicles when
[1:25:20] judah had already anointed him king and
[1:25:22] israel comes back to him and said
[1:25:24] david we want you to be king to unite
[1:25:27] israel with judah
[1:25:29] and they bowed
[1:25:31] before him
[1:25:32] that day
[1:25:33] that scripture was fulfilled
[1:25:36] and the heart of god
[1:25:39] was being expressed
[1:25:41] in david
[1:25:43] so now back to a himalaya
[1:25:46] and that sword
[1:25:51] it said that there's none david said
[1:25:53] give it to me
[1:25:55] there's none
[1:25:57] like it
[1:25:59] and the priest hands
[1:26:01] david the sword if we could have that
[1:26:03] one back it's 21
[1:26:05] i think 12 or something like that first
[1:26:08] samuel 21
[1:26:13] verse 9
[1:26:15] there's none like it
[1:26:16] give it to me
[1:26:19] and the priest hands the sword to david
[1:26:23] and it's wrapped
[1:26:25] and david
[1:26:26] is a man after god's own heart
[1:26:30] what did he just get
[1:26:32] from the heart
[1:26:33] of the
[1:26:34] altar
[1:26:36] he receives the sword
[1:26:39] from the priest
[1:26:41] here david
[1:26:42] you fought for it you earned it
[1:26:45] it's yours
[1:26:47] what was god
[1:26:49] really telling us
[1:26:51] about his nature
[1:26:53] and the heart of god
[1:26:56] and there were in the same country
[1:26:57] shepherds keeping watch over their
[1:26:59] flocks by night and lo the angel of the
[1:27:00] lord appeared unto them and said
[1:27:03] fear not for behold this day is born to
[1:27:04] you a savior whose name is christ the
[1:27:06] lord
[1:27:08] because they were sore afraid and he
[1:27:09] said fear not
[1:27:12] and he said for unto you is born this
[1:27:14] day
[1:27:15] and you shall find the babe
[1:27:18] lying in a manger
[1:27:20] wrapped
[1:27:22] in swaddling cloth
[1:27:29] what's the heart of god
[1:27:32] what
[1:27:33] is the sword
[1:27:35] of god
[1:27:36] wherein do we receive the soul
[1:27:41] it's from the sword
[1:27:43] of the word
[1:27:45] when god expressed his nature through
[1:27:47] jesus christ
[1:27:49] he wrapped it
[1:27:50] he wrapped that little sword
[1:27:53] a little baby
[1:27:55] in a swaddling cloth
[1:27:57] here's the sword david
[1:27:59] this is what you prophesied of this is
[1:28:02] what your life
[1:28:03] was all about
[1:28:06] and believe me
[1:28:07] i wrapped it in your life
[1:28:09] i doubt if david even knew half of it
[1:28:13] he probably was he was running for his
[1:28:15] life
[1:28:16] are you out of here they're going to
[1:28:18] kill me
[1:28:20] and think about when he you know in
[1:28:21] front of the cave that day and how he
[1:28:23] had to
[1:28:25] climb over those guys to get out of
[1:28:27] there scared for his life
[1:28:32] but he became a holder
[1:28:35] of the sword
[1:28:37] the wrapped sword
[1:28:39] which we know is jesus christ who cut
[1:28:41] the head
[1:28:42] off of death hell in the grave
[1:28:45] who cuts the head off of
[1:28:48] every enemy
[1:28:50] one last scripture i don't have a clue
[1:28:52] what time it is
[1:28:55] praise the lord
[1:28:56] hebrews chapter 2.
[1:28:59] do you love him
[1:29:01] it'll be wonderful
[1:29:03] and to know that he's just he's wrapped
[1:29:06] himself in all of this
[1:29:08] i call it stuff right and all of this
[1:29:11] stuff and all of these words and all of
[1:29:13] these things it's
[1:29:14] it's all jesus christ
[1:29:17] and if you can't brother branham said
[1:29:18] there's types and shadows
[1:29:21] and then there's anti-types and i don't
[1:29:23] ever never under really stood anti-types
[1:29:26] but there's anti-types and then there's
[1:29:28] types of types
[1:29:29] and types of types of
[1:29:32] brother branham said i'm just a
[1:29:33] typologist
[1:29:35] but in hebrews chapter 2
[1:29:38] what
[1:29:39] was it when david
[1:29:41] you know went before goliath
[1:29:43] and his court you know his big shot
[1:29:45] brothers with all their military honors
[1:29:47] and stuff they're all hiding from
[1:29:49] goliath
[1:29:50] you know they've all got their heads
[1:29:52] down and david jumps up on the rock
[1:29:54] what's the matter with you guys
[1:29:57] why is that uncircumcised philistine
[1:30:00] defy the army of the living god what was
[1:30:02] that
[1:30:03] that's the heart of a king
[1:30:05] that's the heart of the king
[1:30:08] telling them why are you hiding
[1:30:12] from that uncircumcised philistine i can
[1:30:14] tell you why they were hiding
[1:30:16] it says it right here
[1:30:19] verse 14 chapter 2 hebrews
[1:30:24] something to be learned here actually
[1:30:25] for as much then as the children are
[1:30:27] partakers of flesh and blood
[1:30:29] he also himself
[1:30:32] likewise took part of the same
[1:30:35] who did
[1:30:37] christ did
[1:30:39] jesus god himself in flesh the word of
[1:30:42] god in flesh
[1:30:44] took part of the same
[1:30:50] that through death he might destroy him
[1:30:54] that had the power of death that is
[1:30:58] the devil
[1:30:59] and deliver them who through the fear of
[1:31:02] death for all their lifetime
[1:31:04] subject to bondage
[1:31:07] why were they afraid
[1:31:09] why were they hiding behind the rocks
[1:31:11] and the trees
[1:31:13] and even saul's way back up there in his
[1:31:15] tent going oh man what are we going to
[1:31:16] do i don't want to be slaves to the
[1:31:17] philistines
[1:31:19] what were they afraid of
[1:31:21] it was the fear
[1:31:24] of the power of death
[1:31:26] because in the garden he said the day
[1:31:29] you eat thereof you shall die
[1:31:32] well we know elijah didn't
[1:31:35] and enoch didn't
[1:31:37] and
[1:31:38] what did they overcome
[1:31:41] what did they overcome
[1:31:46] we know that
[1:31:48] it says enoch pleased god we know that
[1:31:50] he knocked out a testimony he read that
[1:31:52] testimony in the book of jude
[1:31:54] said enoch prophesied this
[1:32:00] they overcame their fear
[1:32:03] of death
[1:32:06] you have to go back and look at elijah
[1:32:07] again
[1:32:09] and see what compelled them how was it
[1:32:13] they were able to
[1:32:15] because it says here jesus
[1:32:17] became
[1:32:20] that
[1:32:22] took it all on
[1:32:23] so that we who were in bondage
[1:32:27] we could be delivered
[1:32:30] from the fear of death
[1:32:33] because all their lives all of our lives
[1:32:35] we have been in bondage
[1:32:38] to the fear
[1:32:39] not death itself
[1:32:41] brother branham just said he dies for a
[1:32:43] christian you don't really even die you
[1:32:44] just step into a different

[1:40:42] brother david
[1:40:43] brother god bless you

[1:40:50] love beautiful sister thank you
[1:40:53] lord
[1:40:56] god bless you thank you
[1:41:00] [Music]
[1:41:24] [Music]
[1:41:27] just doing some reading and
[1:41:32] that sword was
[1:41:34] there behind the ephod wrapped
[1:41:38] jesus christ was wrapped
[1:41:40] in the cradle
[1:41:43] and though the prophet does not speak it
[1:41:45] in these exact words
[1:41:50] he spoke to us in our generation
[1:41:54] that the word was wrapped in simplicity
[1:41:58] not to look into the complicated not to
[1:42:00] look into the theology not to think that
[1:42:03] we had to be of great mental capacity
[1:42:08] but the word wrapped in simplicity and
[1:42:11] brother branham said
[1:42:13] the dwells in simplicity
[1:42:15] he's amongst his people in simplicity
[1:42:19] and he titled a sermon even that he
[1:42:22] hides himself in simplicity and reveals
[1:42:25] himself in the same and when you take my
[1:42:29] brother and sister in the whole realm
[1:42:32] of the things that god has done created
[1:42:35] heaven
[1:42:36] and earth
[1:42:38] all the supernatural
[1:42:41] we
[1:42:43] are the simple
[1:42:45] expression of god
[1:42:48] not complicated
[1:42:50] we don't have to have a great
[1:42:52] explanation
[1:42:54] we just have as brother david preached
[1:42:56] tonight got to just let it live out
[1:42:59] just let it come out
[1:43:01] and if we will just let it it will
[1:43:04] amen isn't that so beautiful
[1:43:06] and he says that god hiding himself in
[1:43:09] simplicity then revealing himself
[1:43:12] in the same
[1:43:14] so it's right there before us it's so
[1:43:17] simple so beautiful
[1:43:20] you know another thought that struck me
[1:43:21] while he was speaking for generations
[1:43:24] upon generations upon generations
[1:43:27] upon generations upon generations
[1:43:31] and i could just keep going
[1:43:34] the word
[1:43:36] has always produced what god said it
[1:43:38] would
[1:43:40] aren't you glad we can sit here in this
[1:43:42] day right now
[1:43:44] and just
[1:43:45] know that we are the very expression
[1:43:48] of god
[1:43:50] wrapped up
[1:43:51] my brother and sister how beautiful
[1:43:53] brother david i appreciated that that
[1:43:54] was beautiful
[1:43:56] very very beautiful thought
[1:43:58] amen just so happy
[1:44:00] so i'm just going to let brother jason
