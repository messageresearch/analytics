to him Lead Me Lord I will follow Lead Me Lord I will go you have called me I will answer Lead Me Lord I once more Lead Me Lord I will follow Lead Me Lord I will go you have called me I will answer me I will go can we say Amen to that this morning amen you know it's so wonderful to to know that we've been called Amen to just try to be a follower remember when Israel left out of Egypt as they departed from Goan the scripture tells us they were a mixed multitude see some went because they wanted a change in their life but they weren't really called and those that are called can endure this test of time and those that just follow will not and I say thank you Lord that we're called because this test of time is a tremendously difficult test um everything that we do everything that we believe the scripture says must be tested and when it comes into the fire it's only those that are called have the endurance to go through that kind of test right I thank you Lord for your calling for your gift this morning I just want to bring greetings to you from Brother Rich Cobb there in Monmouth Oregon uh and his family uh they just uh want you to uh know that they love you and they're looking forward uh to someday soon coming back to see us and I I will definitely encourage you on that amen um brother rich brought something to my attention that I wasn't aware of and uh up in Sandpoint or cordelane area there is the little group of Believers you all know brother Roar and sister Mona and their boys and uh their family uh it would be sister Mona's brother Moses wol has um got a tumor on his kidney and the doctors say the only way to treat it whatever it is is to remove his kidney and that surgery is to take place sometime in the next few days and so we just ask for your prayers for brother Moses God would just come down on the scene we would actually prefer just to see him heal amen but if it goes to that then we pray that God would just bless the hand of the surgeon to uh the the surgery to to uh go smoothly so if you'll just remember them we certainly would appreciate that amen I want to speak to you today just a little shift uh in uh what we've been preaching on we haven't even really touched on those things when we're talking about being sold out to God but we'll make a little shift here after the new year and we'll talk about those that are sold out on the other side for a brief time and uh then we'll move into the make believer then we'll go on uh into the parts that are really important to us now my brother and S sister if we ever lose our compassion for the unsaved then we have lost it all right we we need to continue hold it upon your heart upon your mind that you need to Foster that atmosphere that it's not well those poor people out there but you need to Foster the attitude that we don't know who the last one is and you might be talking to them at work at their grocery store across the sidewalk and so foster that attitude that we want to just present Christ a loving Christ anyone can get up and present Christ in judgment but to present him in true love amen let that be the burden of our heart I want to speak to you today on the topic or the subject of what we say really does matter amen and we'll just draw this out of Matthew the 15th chapter starting with verse 21 thank you sister Ruth brother Chris amen uh just uh take a few moments today to to um present uh this thought and by God's grace uh Brothers there is a uh input select in the middle of my screen so I can't see anything Hallelujah there's an input select in the middle of my screen where I can't read so as we look at this today amen I don't know I don't know what to do with it here can I just push exit exit doesn't work amen so as we look at this today we want to just draw this thought out of Matthew 15 and and as we'll look at this we just want to um take the um uh thought as it were to today and and just let it be broadened to us let's not stay in a little narrow Focus but let us be broadened that that we could take and grasp the whole picture of what God is presenting to us and so we will um just turn now in our Bibles and and uh we'll just uh oh there we go you got to love technology and you got to love the people that understand technology amen and uh cuz I'm not one of them but please love me then Jesus went then and departed to the coast of Ty and sedon and behold a woman of Canaan come out of the same coast and Cried unto him saying have mercy on me oh Lord thou son of David my daughter is grievously vexed with a devil but he answered her not a word and his disciples came and besought him saying send her away she's really disturbing our service she's really discouraging to us with all of her crying send her away for she crith after us but he answered and said I am not sent but unto the lost sheep of the House of Israel then came she and worshiped him yes saying Lord help me but he answered and said it is not meat to take the children's bread and to cast it to dogs and she got angry no got in her car and peeled out and drove away and she said truth Lord I recognize the truth prise the Lord you didn't come in that context to me oh Hallelujah yet the dogs eat of the crumbs which fall from their master's table then Jesus answered and said into her oh woman great is thy faith be it unto thee even as thou Wilt so he just granted to her the complete desire of her heart and her daughter was made whole from that very hour amen Heavenly Father we just ask for your guiding hand Lord for your blessings in this service today Lord speak to us we pray in your precious name amen amen you may be seated you know whenever I look at this scripture I I'm always amazed how my brother and sister that when God moves when God works we find that when he calls a son or daughter of God that calling is so strong that it would break every Bond every chain that would bind that individual would be completely loosed Torn Free ripped out because nothing can keep a son or a daughter of God from the word of God and so often times uh we'll see here as we'll just uh uh look often times you know we see uh an event take place and um we see it just a little bit different so I want to just here and we'll find the the great similarities but I want to come and look into the Book of Mark now and so this is how Mark records this event in scripture and from thence he arose and went unto the borders of Ty and sedon and entered into a house and would have no man know it but he could not be hid for a certain woman whose young daughter had an unclean Spirit heard of him and came and fell at his feet the woman was a Greek a Sy phenician by nation and she B besought him that he would cast forth the devil out of her daughter but Jesus said unto her let the children first be filled for it is not meat to take the children's bread and to cast it unto the dogs and she answered and said unto him yes Lord yet the dogs under the table eat of the children's crumbs and he said unto to her for this saying go thy way the devil has gone out of thy daughter and when she was come to her house she found the devil gone out and her daughter laid upon the bed it is out of this passion of portion of scripture uh that I have drawn my thought or uh title today you see he declares unto her it's because of this saying right it wasn't something that was held down in her heart but she come and she spoke it out she acknowledged she knew that he was God she recognized by Revelation but she my brother and sister if I could lay this out carefully this morning you see when God calls you wait I already mentioned that didn't I when God calls you there will will be nothing keep you from coming to the word you will have struggles you will have what we would call failures you will have difficult times you'll have maybe children that are possessed of an unclean Spirit but those that are called recognize the word of God and so it's here that this woman knowing that there is a need knowing that her situation is dire she comes she needed a remedy and uh I would say that this morning my brother and sister she had a revelation where to find the remedy it wasn't that someone had said hey there's some religious guy over here speaking and things are happening you see God placed the need in her and the desire in her and then he gives Direction he said for I will be with you even in you even in you you don't have to guide yourself you have to let go and let God guide you and so in this we see she was anointed to be led right to our lord Jesus she was anointed to come and behold she has a revelation that he doesn't have to come he doesn't have to lay hands on her he doesn't even have to enter in the house she's looking for a word oh praise the Lord we've got word we've got the word my brother and sister we don't we don't have to have as it were some man come to the house we don't have as it were to to to have some great event take place we just need to get to the word and the word will be the answer to our situation and so as we'll see this we find that she is there and and uh you might if you want to take it in a a more abrupt method you would say that our lord Jesus uh uh insulted her but you see she had a need and there was nothing nothing nothing did I say nothing going to drive her away from having that need fulfilled she wasn't going to say well I guess if he's going to call me a dog then I will just leave here because I am not a dog but she caught the Revelation I hope you get this this morning she had caught a revelation he wasn't really talking about her he was talking about the fact that she as a gentile the word was not sent to her but she come with great faith and said I know the word when I see it I know the word when I hear it I know the word when I'm in its presence and you're not going to send me away because even the dogs get the crumbs from the children's table that's right amen and our lord Jesus in Matthew records it as because of her faith but in mark it it is because of the words that you have spoken would that be two different statements no no it was her faith expressed in words amen amen that's she didn't just hold Faith down in her heart and say my daughter will be healed my daughter will be healed she was there and she put her faith not only into action she's there before Jesus crying out but she put her faith into words and expressed it and said I may be a dog but this crumb here is worthy these Crumbs are worthy for us for me to be able to sh and Jesus then says for your words for what you have said let me give it in the exact words for this saying go thy way amen the devil has gone out of thy daughter amen hallelujah oh my brother and sister I want to just reiterate this she needed a remedy she had a revelation where to find it that's right right and we are here in the hour we're living in my brother and sister the scripture tells us that everything that will befall the world will befall you you be rich you be poor you be hot or cold you have sickness you have health all of these things see we don't have a blanket exemption where the bride of Christ we'll never get the sniffles sister Jerry and I was just discussing this just a little bit and you know it's kind of interesting Saints you know I had held in my heart uh that uh Lord just let our church let Grace Tabernacle the uh the Believers here let us just pass through this pandemic without the co I've spoke this from the pulpit before let us just pass through without the pandemic touching us but then it comes and it comes in a full force yeah but my brother and sister God took us through the fire brought us out on the other side healthy so then it become irrelevant whether you had the co or not because you had the remedy the Lord hallelujah I tell you I'd rather not hide from the issue I would rather have the remedy amen now brother brandham says here in the patmas vision he says there is a cry in all hearts for that rest but the majority don't know the answer so they try to steal the Cry by a religious process of keeping certain days or accepting denominational Creeds and dogmas but failing in that many try drinking and carousing and every physical excess thinking that by worldly pleasures there can be some satisfaction but as such there is no rest I think some of us can say Amen we know this the truth this isn't just words on a on a screen that this is words to us they smoke and take pills to quiet their nerves but there is no rest in Earthly potions they need Jesus they need the Heavenly remedy the rest of the spirit I say Amen to that amen amen then the most of them go to church on Sunday see now they're trying to find the remedy they go to church on Sunday that is good but even there they have no idea how to approach God and how to worship him that's right Jesus said that true worship was in the spirit and in truth John 4:24 but what kind of worship can you get in a church that knows so little of God it puts up a Santa Claus at Christmas and bunnies at Easter amen right what it's saying right there what brother bram's declaring right there is when we go into the traditions and the pageants and all of this stuff without preaching Christ and him crucified we make it all we can look forward to the Easter pageant we can look forward to this we can look forward to that I just love these things my brother and sister we're supposed to be in love with Christ that's right where did they get that they got it from pagans that's it and made it a part of church doctrine sir but when one turns to the Lord and is filled with the Holy Ghost he ceases from all such things he has a rest in his soul he really oh I want to live that's it I want to live Saints I I tell you I speak this to the young people I speak it to everyone let's live life to the fullest amen sister Jerry showed me a T-shirt and I might just order one and we it it said we did we're we didn't how is that we are not descended from fearful men amen and I stand here as a Son of God and I can declare I did not descend from fearful men did Jesus Christ in the flesh he knew what was coming my brother and sister he said Lord if it be thy will let this cup pass from me but nevertheless yes sir what did he do he just put his own desire his own thoughts everything of the flesh man to the side and said thy will be done and he knew the will would require a great sacrifice so now let's look at this my brother and sister I want to go back and and part of the reason I chose this quote there's many that kind of speak along these lines then most of them go to church on Sunday that is good but even there they have no idea on how to approach God and how to worship him I want to draw that out and I want to take it now to this cop phenician woman she was there she knew that in him by Revelation I believe I don't believe somebody persuaded her I don't believe somebody laid it all out about this should be the Messiah and he healed over here and he should be able to help you and your daughter it might be that nobody in the present company knew the situation of her house that's right but he was drawn by the Holy Ghost now my brother and sister when you look in the scripture now some people get all fussed over these things if it doesn't show it in the scripture then you know you shouldn't cover it but we'll find my brother and sister that it is quite late in this scripture where the term or words holy ghost shows up but my brother and sister as the very beginning of this scripture right here the Holy Ghost is present the very spirit of God Amen that's what the Holy Ghost is the very spirit of God so where wherever God is his spirit is also present it is not that we sit here this morning and say well God is in the building with us this morning now we're waiting for his holy spirit to come I'm sorry if he is here the holy spirit is here and if you have the Holy Ghost then you have God in you amen so we're not looking for some second part or third part it is God in you and so here is a Sy syop phenician woman she is there and she recognizes that the remedy to her situation is right here in front of us my brother and sister now I don't want to sound rough or crude but I'm telling you what there's some Believers you can't beat off with a stick and there are those that you just be a little cross with them and why they're just got their feathers ruffled up and and you know I don't know if any of you ever raised bny roosters I'll tell you what a bny rooster does they run around and they peck on everything and everybody until somebody PE back and then they ruffle their feathers up and walk off come on you know there phrase in the world they can dish it out but they can't take it well I'll tell you what we can dish it out and we can take it amen we can say Satan get behind me and he doesn't listen a bit he just keeps throwing those logs and chains and everything out in front of you and my brother and sister we as the bride of Christ will say Well it don't matter Satan what you think you're still defeated right you're still defeated and I'm not just cuz it seemed like there was more obstacles in my path after I stood up and started to voice it get behind me Satan there's more obstacles we don't twist in our mind we're not double-minded we are there he is defeated and in my mind my heart my soul he is behind me he no longer looms uh omniscient ompr strong and fearful in before me he is now defeated and Satan you have caused trouble you have brought many times you have brought distress and and discouragement but that is all behind me and you have to Saints this is not psychology you have to look at that and no matter what happens you have to say I'm sorry Satan you're still behind me yes you're still behind me I don't care the wheels fall off the wagon Satan you're still behind me now look at this lady look at her approach she comes she doesn't go to the temple to the priest she doesn't go to to to the council she came to the word right she comes to the word because she has Revelation that the word is the answer to her problem Oh my brother and sister many people today and I don't want to go off in any negative vein but many people today my brother and sister they run over here to brother soul and so they run over to here they run over to there they almost seek advice from the counsel they want to do my brother and sister your answer is in the word amen so what does she do when she comes she hadn't had schooling on how to approach Jesus but down in her heart the word as we would see it on the written page was already being opened up to her and she recognized here is my answer here is what I need right you dog no problem I'm a dog I still want the crumbs from your table you might look down on me no problem you see the reason was is cuz by Revelation she was willing to submit herself to the word not to man she was submitting herself to the word she said nevertheless if I'm a dog I want the crumbs all I need is your crumbs cuz even just a touch is sufficient I read a deal this man was a molecular scientist focus on the blood not just of humans but blood in general and he got saved and it was such an interesting thing to him when he got saved gave his heart to the Lord that he being a scientist that studied blood that it would be the blood of Jesus Christ and one day he had just a screaming fit in the laboratory when the revelation of the breakdown of the blood he was thinking of human blood when the breakdown of human blood and I don't remember these terms I don't think in these terms but in the smallest element involved in human blood I forget what that's called but it was some kind of little you know atom thing bouncing around in there break down to the smallest element of human blood and he realized how little of Jesus Christ he needed to be saved he didn't have to have some great big huge portion and he being an intellectual man realized he simply just needed to believe and my brother and sister the man then had a great Revival in his life and in his family because it wasn't by works it wasn't by how much he could serve it wasn't by how much he could give but it was how much he would die or give of himself to let that little bit of Jesus Christ change his life oh you know I think about that what a lovely story amen but look at how her approach is I I need to be moving on but look how this uh approach was that she did not come by some certain H Avenue she did not say well I must do this and I must do this I must offer alms or an offering or some kind of words of Praise but she realized as a child of God a daughter of God that her daughter in the flesh needed a deliverance and here was the one who could do the Deliverance what did she do she come she spoke of him but as brother brandham lays this out for us in the uh uh scriptures concerning Matthew that she came and she said Lord help me now Lord is a master right so she said uh Master help me but you see the problem was is she was identifying with him in the wrong fashion she had come and said have mercy on me oh Lord thou son of David but see she was not of the House of David technically he had no obligation to her but do you realize even as the scripture says when you don't know how or what to say the spirit will give you utterance so she identifies him as Lord Master which was completely correct but thou son of David which was wrong was not the right identification but you see instead of being uh uh uh uh buffered by that or or or set back by that uh she then presses in I hope you catch that this morning it's not about being buffered or set back my brother and sister but it's about pressing in amen you'll find that'll be what separates the bride of Christ you know what I find interesting to just give this in a natural deal sometimes people are right and people will rise up and tell them they're wrong and because they don't have a lot of confidence in their discernment of the right and wrong they can be silenced how would I say this in a better way they can be quieted by someone who's not even correct they say does spread a lie you speak loud and say it often and soon it becomes the truth it's what Satan would like to do quiet the voice of the Bride right by telling you often right you're not she right you're not she you can't be she she is a perfect one she is that but you see if we look at it through Satan's view we will soon believe Satan's words how life must have been for her with a daughter with a spirit on her we don't know what this Spirit calls the daughter to do we don't know uh uh what detrimental things were happening in her life but my brother and sister I can tell you this wasn't a young lady but I can tell you uh Brother David and I on a Wednesday night a man and a woman come into the church here and Brother David and I spent hours with her praying right here in the church only to recognize when it was all over the spirit that was there while she cried out I want forgiveness and I want Deliverance but the spirit there was so strong that she went off and went off with this man she didn't live she didn't uh wasn't married to this man she just uh he he described himself as her protector and I said you got no right to protect her well she chose me and while she cried for deliverance and we prayed for her we prayed with her she admitted it was drugs that took her out and then because of drugs she started to prostitute herself to get the drugs and it destroyed her marriage and her children children to the point that her uh husband uh um they'd recently been divorced even though this had been going for years uh had uh pulled away from her and all of her children and her heart would ache and it was there but you see that Spirit was so strong that in spite of all her cries she found no deliverance from that Spirit right so one can seriously sincerely desire Deliverance without ever finding it are you with me that's right this lady has a daughter with a spirit on her she's come to the place she's willing to do anything to find Deliverance for a daughter young people not just young people all of us but young people be careful who you make friends with be careful the music you listen to be careful of the things you read and be careful of the things you say because you see when the door is open to those Spirits the spirits my brother and sister as we see with the seven sons of CA they're not afraid of us I'm talking about in the flesh they're not afraid of us Paul we know Jesus we know who are you and then thrashed him and chased him out of the building that's right it's not a game no we don't know what brought this little this little girl into this stage where she is possessed by an evil spirit but what we do know is there was a mother that said my daughter will not go on like this my daughter will be delivered of this and she didn't sit back and say someday God will do this my brother and sister she went to what the source she went to the word and said you know what there's Deliverance in the word and I'm going to approach the word and I will not be offended by the word until I have what I need oh I'll tell you what let us have a church full of mothers like that let's have a church full of Believers like that that are going to go to the source and they are not going to be offended not turned away they're not going to be easily discouraged that's right Hallelujah a mother who believed the report amen what she went right to The Living Word that's right there's the difference it has to be the Living Word Sunday my brother and sister many people might feel like I'm too blunt on these things many people this morning will be in church many people will be in message churches and they will walk out today no different than they walked in you got to go to the source and that is the Living Word not that we read quotes not that we read scriptures not that we recount these things the word's got to be living and you have to come to it you have to come to the place you say I will submit myself to the word we're not talking about submitting to a man we're talking about submitting to the word and when we will submit to the word we will find the the answer the remedy to the situations of Our Lives amen she knew in her heart what needed to happen and she took a Hal of that amen I imagine that Satan probably come with a spirit of offense said he called you a dog you should ruffle your feathers and walk off well if that's the way he's going to speak to me but you see the real believer knows where the remedy is knows where the life is at and if the word says you need to stop what you're doing change your life you need to be Washed by the Water you need to repent you need whatever it might be the real believer is there and says this is the truth and this hurts but I can't walk away from the truth no matter how hard it hurts I can't walk away from the truth there's something in the truth that is stronger than any spirit of offense and my brother and sister Satan certainly would like to work the spirit of offense he like to come in and when people oh praise the Lord I'm preaching at anyone in general but when people are corrected by the word we got a decision to make I'll either stand with the word or I will be a it oh my brother and sister I'm telling you I know it hurts it's a two-edged sword it cuts on the way in it cuts on the way out but what happens is is when we are delivered from those things we recognize the sacrifice is worth the result amen and here is a mother committed Beyond any offense could we today say Lord let me be committed Beyond any offense never never Lord let me be offended hallelujah amen now in the sermon perseverance brother Brown says this here there's many places actually I had to sort through them until oh you guys will like me saying it this way I had to sort through all these quotes till I found the one that said it the way I wanted it to say it now the reason I say that is I in my heart was looking as it were for a particular approach right we're not changing it we're going as it were to the same exact spot but we have 360 to approach it from and I'll just be honest with you I I like to be transparent to you I I looked at these quotes and I found the one that approached it from the direction that God laid on my heart amen and this poor woman was the same she wanted she knowed that she was going to get it what's that Revelation revelation of Faith she knew she was going to get it she wasn't going there hoping for a Deliverance for her daughter she went there knowing I'm going to have a Deliverance for my daughter see and that's why in Matthew he speaks in such as her faith but Mark speaks of her words and there is no conflict there was no doubt no matter what she had to climb through come on Saints this is we're talking about leod deia we're talking about a world that is so wonderful so comfortable so good so lulling us to sleep Leep no matter what she had to climb through for just a moment we'll deviate to another woman who had a blood issue she climbed over them under him went through them nothing was going to stop her from the Revelation all I need to do is touch the Hemm of His Garment amen what a revelation that's right you see you'll find my brother and sister none of the crowd around her had that Revelation so much that the disciples were like what do you mean everybody's touching you but she had a personal revelation now my brother and sister personal Revelations are not outside of the word but it's real because it's mine personal revelation lines up with the word but it is God speaking to you amen it is not a general conversation to the whole church assembly but God dealing with you and it becomes personal that God speaks to you in that and you then stand upon that someone else would say I've never heard of God doing it that way why would God speak to you why would my brother and sister it don't matter what they think it don't matter if you have some great historical record to back it up if it lines up to the word and God spoke it to you hold on to that that's right amen amen amen she was going to get it anyhow am so look at this I like the prophet's words here and I don't believe they're just random words I believe there's anointing here so Jesus couldn't even turn her back right get this now I want you to think about that she wanted it so much she was so determined to get what was she felt was rightfully hers for her daughter that even Jesus and brother brandham says here by calling her of the wrong race calling her a dog it wasn't right to take the children's bread and feed dogs and so forth like that but still she went right on after it why because she had a revelation that her daughter's healing was right here oh she wasn't going to walk away until she possessed her daughter's Deliverance oh Hallelujah she went right after it anyhow because she was persistent amen she had a need her daughter was dying others had been he healed so why couldn't her daughter be healed that was the god of creation Now I want you to think about it it was a god of creation that went right down to her town right down to her house laid Revelation how did it come to her we don't know it might have been a passer by saying you know up here they have a man and he's speaking the words and laying on hands and and spitting in in the mud and wiping it on their eyes all these Miracles are taking place and it's just phenomenal and she's sitting there saying there's the answer for my daughter I don't know how it happened but the word come to her in her house amen and struck her heart and that's Revelation and it led her out the door she left her child behind in the care of someone else and went on and found this and when she come no amount of words right no amount of words our pastor preaches too hard our pastor preaches too long there's times our pastor makes no sense that's I don't care I didn't come to see the pastor that's right I didn't come for the pastor I came because I believe God is here I believe God is in his word and I believe his word is here so you might have come to see if the tie fits the shirt I picked it out myself is it okay none of that matters nothing's going to discourage it because that's not the reason I came amen is to whether he would say oh woman of great faith will have need you no no just a second the faith was there yeah but the test yeah came before the expression of the faith now I'm not speaking lightly I don't I don't don't mean to speak lightly but it's just something I wonder about and that's when you meet people that you've hardly shook hands with him nice to meet you I'm a Believer also I'm a man of great faith you've went through a fiery furnace you've been in a lion's den you've Fallen to the Earth from a burning airplane what what where where is the proof you're a man of great faith now you're going to think I'm turning on my own words here in just a minute often question knew a man many years ago my dad used it to make a lesson to me this man used to every time you'd see him known this man till he passed away practically my whole life and uh he would come up and Shake Your Hand and I'm just a humble man okay you're a humble man one day my dad said son I just want you to understand those that have to tell you they're humble usually aren't because the H humble man's life will show you he's humble amen but while it seems like here in just a second you're going to think I have a conflict sometimes God wants us to speak those things that are not as though they are that's right Hallelujah I'm a man of Faith that's it I'm a man of Faith right now I might not have enough faith for a toothache but I'm making my declaration I'm a man of faith amen amen you might be able to stand and say Lord I'm a humble man and you might realize that in reality you're not you you know how you find out whether someone's humble or not just go scratch them right go scratch them you'll find out if they're humble or not often times saints come on let's let's not necessarily for humor sake but let's recognize this often for not you scratch someone and they will humbly choke you kick you and bite no it's the truth but God make us humble I want to be humble Lord I want to be a man of Faith amen so what am I going to do I'm going to claim that I'm going to speak out I'm going to make my claim on who I am according to the word of God let me back up a little bit she went right after it anyhow because she she was persistent she had a need her daughter was dying others had been healed so why couldn't her daughter be healed and that was the god of creation Drew her right to it Jesus said for this saying the devil left your daughter see for this saying my brother and sister brother brandom's coming right back here out of Mark and for this saying for the simple fact that you stood here you took the words that were testing if you'll eat my flesh and drink my blood what was it it wasn't a commandment in the sense that we often think of it was a test yes and you won't have to worry about looking at the bread and the wine and understanding revelation of what was being said if you can't get past the simple words Eat My Flesh and drink my blood there what was what was God doing he just sorted or sifted them right there and there would be those that were there my brother and sister I can assure you there would be those who understood it no more than those who walked away but as the words were there Lord where could we go I just got nowhere to go Lord I don't know that I even understand what you just said but I got nowhere else to go Lord so I'm just going to stay right here and I you know Revelation going to come my mind she had the right approach to God's Gift did you know God does things sometimes just to do things a different way just to find out what people will do you know Saints I I I'm you guys just keep coming back and I'm happy I want us to have a church full of uh Godly Holy Ghost filled people and I apologize you know there's sometimes I just say things that you might say now why did he say that I just say that because uh I want to see what you're going to do about it I want to see what your reaction is and sometimes church maybe I shouldn't be so transparent here but there's been things said from this Pulpit that while you sat there and said now I'm not sure I understand where Brother Paul's going it lit other people on fire and I got to watch them melt down right in the church why did I say it is Paul so bright that he can think far enough ahead and word it in such a way I'm sorry ask my wife she'll tell you sorry about that sister Jerry no you see God knowing what button to push come on kids um do you know what button to push on Mom H come on you know what I'm talking about the mama you love me button is when you're in the store and you want her to buy you something and you keep pushing the mama you love me button but when it's time to vacuum and do the laundry and whatever you push a different button amen amen and all the children here today said [Music] amen God does things to find out what we will do amen that's right cuz if you can be discouraged and run off he will discourage you and run you off but I don't think that that's going to happen now look brother Brown goes on to say it's over your head you haven't seen it and haven't noticed but I done something just now to do something that's right so he did something to cause something else to happen and we don't have a clue what he was talking about but neither did the people in the service and that so helped me and I watched it work see you say things you change your attitude right you change your voice you change sometimes your sermon watching and seeing certain things then watch and see how it acts I know you guys don't see the strings but I commit myself to God every time I come to this Pulpit Lord let me only say and do what you desire if I could put it to you and I pray that it's not my flesh and not me as a carnal man but you don't see the strings but you see we're here moving and doing according to what God wants done yeah and we see how in many cases it will cause one to look in their life and maybe they'll just start crying or praying or crying out and you'll see another they feel frustrated another feels confused another just plain rejects right amen and then brother Bram goes on he said because the prayer line is fixing to come up and it would be better for that not to be a you so what did he do he come down and he took the sword of the word and he cut away it something and I'll just put it this turn I don't mean it literal in the church here but somebody on the front row is just like Hallelujah and somebody somewhere else in the church is like oh if I could just get my hand around his neck same words same words but he says it'd be better off that it wasn't among you see just to see it happen then you change yourself and go back somewhere again see God did that very thing he still does it noticing she had the right approach to God's gift and remember she was the first one Gentile that God ever done a miracle on she was the first Gentile Faith admits the word is truth oh Hallelujah I I would almost ask brother Alex uh but then I thought well okay we can just make the emphasis I wanted me to put that in great big red letters on there Faith admits the word is truth and look at these closing lines now this going to be a little pointed sorry if it does offend anyone Faith let's be in context here okay are you with me high school dropout talking about English I want to teach you an English lesson Faith there's our subject admits the word is truth and faith is reverent yes amen see it's still in our subject faith is reverent very reverent when you find people Saints amen don't agree with you and they become irreverent Amen in the service in the sanctuary in the fer in the basement in the parking lot there's something wrong H that was a little straight wasn't it but we can make excuses for it well you just don't understand no I don't understand cuz I know what the prophet said I don't understand and I thank God for this and I am not boasting lest I would be tested but my brother and sister I've set in Services where things were preached that I blantantly knew did not line up with the message did not line up with the Bible and I was able to walk out there shake hands with the preacher after the service and go on knowing that they staunchly sincerely believed in what they were saying even though it wasn't correct and I never had to try and burn the church down that's right so there's something wrong when the faith won't admit truth and is irreverent little blunt but sometimes I think blunt is good amen see she submitted to the word and it brought the word to life in her house Isn't that cool wherever she was at we don't know how far she was from her home but as she is there submitting herself to the word and now we don't know exactly all of those things we don't know maybe she got down on her hands and knees maybe she got down on her knees maybe she did whatever you see sometimes we put too much emphasis on the physical postering reminds me one time I preached in a church that sounds a little arrogant doesn't it not too too much humility here I preached in a church and it was an awesome service I got to watch God move I got to watch break through a a sister come to the altar that had had this bitterness that was just ripping her life apart and God delivers her in that service another family was having an issue with a child and they managed to convince their child to come up front and we prayed with them and God delivered that child we got to see all of these things and I also got to walk out of that church in the foyer at the end of the service and shake hands with a man who is almost like God bless you thank you what are we going to do with the word amen right it's not the man here submit ourselves to the word humble ourselves to the word let the word be preeminent let the word correct us let the word wash us right go to the word and don't be driven away there's plenty of critics the world we live in today my brother and sister there's plenty of critics we wouldn't know what to believe we wouldn't know what to where to go and what to do if we listen to the critics but listen to the Revelation that God placed in your heart amen not what this man thinks it should be not this man's interpretation of the message what this man sees the faults of the message you need to find your own personal revelation with Jesus Christ and when he tells you eat my flesh and drink my blood then you with revelation will be able to say I will Lord you won't be there questioning what's going on has he turned into a vampire has he turned into a cannibal why would a man do this he must be be above my brother and sister it showed there was not one drop of Revelation in them they were following because it was the New Movement it's the new thing in town it was the new ideology we'll follow it and see what happens but when it come down to God in them they couldn't deal with it they had to push back how can would God be in me well I'll tell you how he'll be in you because he said he would we don't need any other evidence than he said he would I don't have to go find some tangible thing to hold up and show you God's in me he said he would be I believe him you believe him Hallelujah this woman knew oh as brother Bram said right there in the quote amen she knew and she was going to get it Hallelujah now look here in the law now Paul speaking here of the valley or the shadow rather the law being a shadow of good things to come could never make the worshipper perfect then he goes on to show what the Perfection is see that's necessary we need to know what we're striving to there's a goal before us Onward Christian Soldiers where are we going I don't know well if you don't know somebody will take a left turn and take you with them but if you know where you're going you can't be diverted from the path God called you to Hallelujah h then he goes on to show what the Perfection is now it's a strange thing that this is so much thought of people they say well I'm weak my faith is not very much I'm not a very good Christian now you guys quit reading ahead I don't know how we're going to do this I'm going to have to hold something up here come on now we're going to have accounting here have any of you ever done that I'm not a very good Christian I don't got any faith I'm weak the rest of you didn't think so we'll pray for you because you need to get rid of that idea because you will be tested you will be brought right to the fiery furnace yes brother one time he said this in humor not making mock he said you know some people before God can get their attention has to bring them to a fiery furnace right full of lions in the middle of the ocean cuz that's what it'll take to get their attention yes sir and God will do it if you're a son or daughter of God he will do it yes sir amen okay I want to close sister Ruth will you come that's just what the devil wants you to say you're just talking his language right then see you mustn't never say that don't never let your testimony be negative amen now Saints this is a sign right here that will go beyond it will be the sign that you have gone beyond your human element when you can come to the place that you don't let nothing negative thank you Lord all I can say is is Lord help us and I say it in sincerity Saints that's what the devil wants you to say you're just talking his language you must never say that don't never let let your testimony be negative let it be positive all the time I am saved sir I have God in my heart I believe him with all my heart do you believe in Divine Healing with all my heart let your testimony always and your thoughts everything never permit a negative thought to come in your mind if you can help it and when it starts that don't entertain it well you say I can't help the thoughts from coming well that'll be like the farmer that said he couldn't stop couldn't stop the birds from flying over his place but he could sure stop them from roosting so that's a good thing see you can't help the thoughts when they come look I'm going to speak something really direct right here we live in the most wicked time and some of the thoughts that will Ricochet on your mind will be thoughts that you're like oh my where did that come from but what Satan's trying to do is get us to go oh let me think on that a while so that's a good thing you see you can't help the thoughts when they come but don't entertain them just pass it on no sir Jesus Christ is my savior All Things Are Mine by God and I'm going to keep them I'm going to testify of them and God can only bless you as you confess what he has done it for you see he's the high priest of our confession is that right Hebrews 3 he said that he's the high priest of our confession he can only do for us as we accept it believe it and confess it oh my you realize that sister that come to Jesus quoted that quote yes sir did are you with me she quoted that quote she didn't have it to say well you know the prophet of the seventh age you know said this she didn't have it but she quoted that quote in life by her very action she just quoted this quote that we read amen and we by action can quote this very quote amen amen and it can be the director of our life it can be our Compass amen oh hallelujah amen I'll just stop right there I just pray my brother and sister as you look at this as you see these things and you recognize what it is just think of this sister she had a need a child but you see it wasn't all about the child the prophet of God says several places through the message that we ought to exercise our faith oh my here was that sister had a need for her daughter what was that that was God's oh I hope you see this that was God's method that he used he changed that around and it come down at her house and she's got a daughter possessed of a spirit of rock and roll she's got a daughter possessed of a spirit of dress and wrong she's got a daughter that's U uh with a spirit of rebellion I don't know what it is my brother and sister and we're not picking on you daughters but you look at that and what it was is she looked at that and said in her heart yes sir there's a Deliverance for this and I'm going to set out and go to the one who can deliver and somebody said well what's he look like I don't know what he looks like but he's there the Revelation in my heart said he's present that my daughter was not called see here's the difference that's right oh Saints parents listen to me I've dealt with parents having gave up on their children said well I guess that's what they need to go do they're working on their testimony you could have knocked me down with a feather wait what did you just say you just gave approval for the devil to take your son or your daughter and make a testimony I'm sorry I'm going to be like this syop phenician woman and I'm going to go find the one that has the answer I'm not going to say oh praise God they'll have a testimony you know what I think a testimony is now look Saints I backslid God was gracious to me never let me get too far off the track I always felt like a weirdo as in the world no constraints of church religion or parents but it didn't mean God let me go no that's right but I tell you what if I could by God's grace today stand before you I don't even think I need to tell you what my testimony would be if by God's grace I could stand today I would have a testimony that I was raised in the church I never left that God has been real to me by whole life and the power of the Holy Ghost controlled me hallelujah oh yeah oh yeah I'll use the word control never let me go that's right but praise God I was is out working on my testimony no I'm sorry I don't buy that that's right I don't buy that we need more syy phenician mamas that's going to say you know what I'm not going to let I'm not going to let the devil control my child I'm not going to let the devil control my household that's right now it doesn't say anything about a husband well let's just say she's got a husband she's said I'm not going to let this it's messing with my marriage it's messing with my other children it's messing with this I tell you what we're we're going to close but by God's grace I can show you the pictures if we can all afford a ticket to fly to South Africa I can meet you face to face they'll tell you yourself my brother and sister what the power of God will do a son that thought he was Elvis reincarnated had a good voice sang like Elvis could play a guitar do

tore up by the lion he said I don't understand and I was looking at that it caused me to say you know what thank you Lord for a word that's opened up in our day to know that those Saints of old were anointed yes sir to walk out there did they not feel physical fear no I imagine they probably in their shoes but the anointing was so strong this is what God called me for the Lord prise the Lord and so much history you'll see as they stood there as the lion rushed to them and one swipe of a paw finished their life and here we are in leoa every destructive Spirit that's ever been in the ages that's right I hope you catch this cuz we think oh Lord could I have stood in a Coliseum and a a lion be turned loose on me would I have not run would I have not tried to climb the fence would I have not begged for mercy no they were anointed amen that's it and they stood under that anointing amen and I'm here to tell you that every one of those Spirits from the first age coming right on down is here right now and you're anointed to stand amen you're anointed to say Amen to the word you're anointed to fulfill the word you were called to so whenever Satan would tell you why I couldn't have
