this day this day [Music] just love the lord and we're so glad that we had a church where you can come to you stand tonight musicians i committed the most unpardonable sin and sent my notes to alex about five minutes ago so if the quotes don't show up or the scriptures don't show up you forgive them and blame me so just had so much coming out here that i had to keep writing it down so um trust that lord will speak tonight and we'll hear from him when we just have a word of prayer heavenly father lord jesus we're looking forward to hearing from you this evening and lord we we don't ever want to come to make ourselves something for the only thing we want to make of ourselves is a better version of you lord and that is done by your grace and your word lord and our faith that you can do it we're desiring lord jesus to draw near to you to push aside everything that would hinder your ability to move in our lives through jesus father we pray that you just take control of the service now every spirit or thought that's contrary to your word you pray you'd find it now lord that we would just be prisoners of christ father that your love would grow within us father that love that the world tries to get at but just crazy perversion of but father we have a true revelation father that that is you lord jesus father working in us lord compassion as the prophet said was you braiding the whip and beating the money changers from the temple father sometimes your word will chase in us lord but that's your love father lord not knowing how you're going to do this tonight father but we are willing and open to your moving in our hearts lord jesus we love you now we commit these words into your hands in jesus christ's name we pray amen if you have your bibles tonight would like to turn with me to exodus 25. if you guys can't do it just do the quotes alex sector at least the quotes if you can by the way it's easier than the scriptures okay well if you want the quotes text me and i will send them to you how about that exodus chapter 25 verse one and the lord spake unto moses saying speak unto the children of israel that they bring me an offering of every man that giveth it willingly with his heart he shall take my offering and this is the offering which ye shall make take of them gold and silver and brass and blue and purple and scarlet and fine linen and goat's hair and ram's skin dyed red and badger skin instead of wood oil for the light spices for anointing oil and for sweet incense onyx stones and stones to be set in the ephod and in the breast breastplate and let them make me a sanctuary that i may dwell among them lord add this blessing to the reading of the world you can be seated tonight so just wanted to focus on that scripture there verse 8 and let them make me a sanctuary that i may dwell among them my title tonight is the spiritual sanctuary of the bride and so um who knows i i have just um these notes that i put down and stuff i was sitting in the office today i came over here a little bit early and i was like i didn't what do you want me to speak lord and i just scrolled back and i have i have some notes where i'll put a title and put a couple of words um or i'll just put a title down because if you don't write it down you're not going to remember it and so i'm scrolling through and i and i and i saw this title there the spiritual sanctuary of the bride and the lord began to deal with my heart and so i feel and maybe it's just me as a man i feel like there's so much more that could be put into this but for lack of time so maybe uh if we have the opportunity we'll do another part on this who knows i've said that before and there's never been part two so but anyways so this verse here but and let them make me a sanctuary that i may dwell among them and um you know it's been said before by some um people and i say that because i've heard it said and taken into the context of well uh if the lord wants if it's the lord's will he'll do it and that is true and that is is truth but what happens is us as human in our flesh we can take that as an excuse to do nothing and so this scripture here he says let them make let them make me a sanctuary so the children of israel all of them had to gather their resources their stones their gold their their jewelry their their uh ram skins and badger skins and the wood they had to get this all together and bring it an offering to build the sanctuary so it is the offering that you give that builds a sanctuary for god to dwell in and we know that that's the one thing brother vernon says we have to do is lay down our self-will so that god can come and move in our lives when we get ourselves out of the way then god can dwell within us we're all predestinated and for ordained to to make that choice but you still have to do it i was i think it was a youth meeting on friday 900 sure but i was talking you know um judas still had a choice that's right pontius pilate still had a choice and because they made the choices they did they suffered for those choices you still have a choice to accept christ and many of us have and you're we reaping this the growth from that choice so it's still up to you we all still have a choice because if we didn't what would be the purpose of redemption so hebrews chapter eight verse verse one if you would like to turn there with me we'll go there so we're all given a choice and we they had to bring the offerings to build the sanctuary the tabernacle for god to dwell in and in hebrews chapter 8 hebrews we know it's a the book that paul wrote kind of breaking down the the um the the religion that the jews had followed this was to the jews for them to understand the transition that has been the change of dispensation that happened when christ died on the cross you imagine growing up in the religion of in in the in the um the acts of being a jew and then suddenly none of that matters anymore you don't have to go to the temple you don't have to it would be very hard to come to that place and and not have any kind of instruction to go forward so god laid it on paul's heart he wrote the book of hebrews and so if you ever have a desire in your heart and at whatever season you're in to understand the types of the the physical tabernacle and the spiritual tabernacle it's very well laid out here in the book of hebrews and brother brown did a whole series on the book of hebrews so anyways hebrews chapter eight here verse one now all the things which we have spoken this is the sum we have such a high priest who is set on the right hand of the throne of the majesty in the heavens so in other words we are no longer have an earthly high priest christ is our high priest in the heaven a minister of the sanctuary and of the true tabernacle which the lord pitched and not man it was not man made it was made of the lord remember our title tonight the spiritual sanctuary of the bride for every high priest is ordained to offer gifts and sacrifices wherefore it is of necessity that that this man have somewhat also to offer for if he were on earth he should not be a priest seen that there are priests that offer gifts according to the law who serve unto the example and shadow of heavenly things as moses was admonished of god when he was about to make the tabernacle force foresee saith he that thou make all things according to the pattern showed thee in the mount so moses the building of the sanctuary came for the revelation that god had given him but now hath he obtained a more excellent ministry by how much also he is the mediator of a better covenant which was established upon better promises so it's better now this new covenant have i given you this new covenant the writing of the words upon our heart is a better covenant because that was just a shadow of what god really wanted to do but because of the season and the times and the age god had to get set forth this pattern in this covenant of of of acts and of blood of bulls and goats he had to set that pattern because of the season well not yet time for the for the the development of the negative to the positive meaning you know like film so that this is now a better covenant and and um established upon better promises which is what we have access to christ that is a promise you have if you have a need there's a promise you can step into or only the high priest used to be able to go and you can receive straight from god that's a better promise amen praise the lord and then in verse 13 in that he saith a new covenant if he have a new covenant he hath made the first old now that which decayeth and waxeth old is ready to vanish away yes okay and he and that he saith a new covenant he hath made the first old so the first covenant is now the old covenant now that which decayeth and waxes old is ready to vanish away so that's ready to be put away that's ready to be vanit to vanish away because there's a better covenant if you continue to the next chapter he says then verily the first covenant had also ordinances of divine service and a worldly or earthly sanctuary so the first covenant the tabernacle in the world there's the first covenant and that's the old man so god put you forth on earth in flesh that you could manifest his word that you would be born today but god had a better covenant a better promise that he wanted to deal in your life and deal with you so he brought forth redemption in your life now you put away the old man and you become a new creation in christ jesus you step from the old sanctuary you step from the old man into the spiritual sanctuary with christ amen the first covenant is passed away amen that second covenant is a new man in christ jesus now um the lord will help us here the if you look at the sanctuary and and if we continue in chapter nine here for there was a tabernacle made the first wherein was the candlestick and the table and the show bread which is called the sanctuary now we know the tabernacle the whole thing that's that's where we dwell with christ the tent and that all that stuff but we're where we're going to come kind of com take liberties to combine this together now we know there's there's christ is in the midst so in the sanctuary you have the candlestick the candlestick must be burning what was one of the great sins that eli committed he let the candlestick go out he let the candle stick out he let his sons there they're there at the they're they're being uh ministering before the the children of israel taking the meat from the offering the wrong way taking the women in the there and in prostitution and and just in in total um decay and and he let the the candle go out and that was one thing that candle had to keep going that oil because that candle was a type is a type of of the holy spirit of christ okay so so so what what happened was even though that cancel went out and then and but god in in the midst of this of this turmoil of god's plan of redemption being displayed in in in the physical with the temple while that wallah display of christ was being misrepresented to the children of israel through the sons of eli and even eli himself god in that moment in that midst was raising up a true prophet was raising up a true representation of christ and it was that true representation that anointed david and then who was typed to the son of david and so so god was raising up a ministry so you see and we'll get to a quote here later on but but you can't be looking at the outside you can't be looking at the physical the uh the outward representation and say oh oh you know this this is this you call and i i've heard this straight from the horse's mouth oh the message is bad because of this person and this church and this happened so the whole thing is bad but that's that's looking at the outside picture if we use that my what would we even do all cars are bad because that one caught on fire for no reason so that's just not a common uh uh thing to live life by comment that's not that's not common sense everyone understands that that's maybe not the whole so we we as as as as as humans as sometimes i get grieved but i know that you know it doesn't matter god's still working when i see a misrepresentation of christ amen but even in that moment even in the moment when you see a misrepresentation of christ to somebody else look i was given a misrepresentation of christ but i'm here today by god's grace serving him with all my heart so god in the midst of that misrepresentation was raising up something that was following according to the word of god amen so all of that came from just this candlestick here but it must be burning that's the that was the law and then we know the oil of that lamp types the holy spirit and it's the holy spirit that keeps the lamp burning that keeps the fire of god but the battle says here in the seven church ages the the sermon the seven church ages 1954. now notice these golden candlesticks this oil poured into these candlesticks now the oil was was what was put in the lamp to burn now aaron it was his duty to light these lamps and these lamps had to be lit hold it hold it on now look keep reference listen these lamps had to be lit by the fire that god had lived amen aaron's sons went in with some strange fire and god slew them in the door that's right strange fire it hap so he says the fire that god started in other words a candle stick had to be burning but it had to be burning from the fire that god started what was i just saying a second ago about a representation of christ someone could come along with their own fire and they can light it right and it can look good but god will not be in that fire because it's not the fire that god lit that's why saints of god you have to have the holy ghost because guess what that candle will reject that fire amen there will be no burning in the sanctuary of christ with that strange fire because that candle will reject that fire just like christ did here he god he slew them at the door before they could come into his sanctuary so they had the fire on the outside you know maybe the children of israel saw them oh look at look at those are the sons of of aaron now we could go to a whole lot right there but i'll just let you fill in the blanks look at them with that fire wow that fire going to the tabernacle but see if they turned away and just ran with that but didn't watch what god did with that fire they would have missed that god rejected that strange fire it was not the fire of the holy spirit see what it comes down to say to god in the age that we are living in today you have to have the holy spirit to discern because there are so many things moving in our midst moving amongst our family and our friends and this church and that church good churches and there are things that are moving in the midst that are not a proper representation of christ but just as you will find you will find that represent that right representation that safety in the saints the spiritual sanctuary of the bride not the spiritual sanctuary of this man or that man or of your own making but the one that god set in place and then that's where you'll find you know today they have a saying and i was telling the youth you know every time you see a thing in the natural it's a perversion of what god's doing in the spiritual or excuse me the secular world they are perverting what god is doing in the spiritual and and so um they have this thing where you know it's a safe place you know you can just be whatever you want you're safe you're safe here you know there's a sign this is a safe zone so you can go there and you can just be nutso and no one will will bother you you know there's no hate speech here well god has a safe place a safe place that protects you that protects you and that's the sanctuary for the bride revelations two verse five remember therefore from whence thou art fallen and repent and do the first works or else i will come unto thee quickly and will remove thy candlestick out of his place except thou repent revelations two verse one i'm going backwards under the angel of the church of ephesus right these things sayeth he that hold up the seven stars in his right hand who walketh in the midst of the seven golden candlesticks two couple things here go repent of your work look if those sons of heroin would have repented of what of those works of trying to bring that trained fire before they ever got there it would have been fine a candlestick and everything but now what what what is being said to the ephesian church age is repent and go back to your first works go back to your first love repent and go back or i'm going to remove the candlestick the type of the whole the of christ i'm gonna i'm just gonna step away you're not gonna find me if you go forward with that unrepentant heart um you're going to be walking in darkness is what it will happen because that candlestick will be removed and you won't be able to see um but now he's but now this other the first verse excuse me let me back up just a second so you want to keep that candle lit get something in your life you need to repent if you want to kill make that right and keep that candle lit in your life you want to strengthen that flame and the philip uh the philadelphian church i think it is that the scripture says and strengthen that which you have that little light and then says that little light that they had he's telling them strengthen that light um so but it says that um he walketh in the midst of the seven golden candlesticks so the christ in the midst of these seven golden cattle sticks so it's christ keeping the flame burning thank goodness it's not left up to me thank goodness that i have something i can lean on i can't go i was listening to to a sermon today and um it was brother brother donny reagan um and he was saying you know you don't challenge the devil the devil the devil puts a challenge forth you go to your to your father and you say hey this has happened you did can you deal with this right and he will you rely on christ for everything don't go off and try to to handle this on your own you need christ look you can't even have the fire to see without the holy ghost the oil and you need christ in the midst protecting that holding that true making sure you have your candle is lit when you find sanctuary with christ that is how you separate and have your lamp lit trimmed full of oil and burning brightly for christ it's christ in the midst keeping that flame burning amen that's inside the sanctuary for the bribe now a couple more quotes here um the ephesian church age 1960 now and we're beginning with the first chapter of of ephesus of ephesians we're talking about the church age i threw a bunch of quotes in here i'm just making sure that this is one i do want to read right here john is the messenger of that at that time walking in the midst of these seven golden candlesticks was jesus christ the almighty god what is he doing he didn't say he was walking in one candlestick he was walking in the midst of all of them what does that denote that he is the same god yesterday today and forever and in every church age to every believer he comes to with the holy ghost to every eighth to every person the same yesterday today and forever holding in his right hand right hand means his authority and power holding in his right hand under control the seven messengers to the seven church ages oh i like that see him walking around these church ages the christ making himself known to his people down through these dark ages down through every age while the church got formal and pulled out some went one way and some another but that little minority of the church still held on and christ worked with them confirming his word winds it right through so christ not only is he in the midst of the candlestick which is jesus christ the same yesterday today and forever all the kind of sticks to every believer every person but he is holding the word in his hand so you have nothing to you just fear to get in that sanctuary so that god he will give you the word he already has under his control and that word doesn't come from strange fire because strange fire can't get inside the sanctuary of god amen so if you want to know if you want to say you know this word that's coming this strange fire that i'm seeing this fire that i'm seeing is it strange or is it truth what does the scripture say um i tried to quote this last time and i didn't remember right but basically you have the ability amen to judge between the two things judge between the scripture and it might even be in hebrews but able to to to rightly divide the word of god you're given that ability what is the spirit of the age that we are living in it's the eagle you can see you can see whether or not this is true or this is or this is false or this is strange fire and how are we going to see it's not your eyes it's christ's eyes you have to be looking through the eyes of christ through the eyes of faith which is his word to say is this strange fire or is this the truth whenever you see something you're concerned or you have a question about something and when you begin to ask god lord is this strange fire or is this your truth don't just run after it because it's fire don't just run after because it's fire so you want to find out you go into the sanctuary see does that fire make it inside there that's how you can tell amen so inside the sanctuary we have the candlestick and then we also have the showbread now the showbread types christ hebrews chapter 7 1957 but the perfection has come to the place that the middle person now if there happens to be a jew here or somebody that understands the old testament testament prove it let me show you i haven't got the old testament with me right now excuse me i'm going to spit that thing out accidentally but in the offering of the showbread that was laying on the kosher plate in the jewish jewish sacrifice at the cleansing of the tabernacles ask any jew on those three pieces of bread the middle piece was broken that was christ the middle piece was broken christ the in between showed that there had to be a breaking somewhere for redemption and that peace was considered redemption on the kosher bread aren't you so glad that you got an in between you got something you got the world on this side and well okay you got it all on both sides but you got that in between you got you got yourself on this side and the world on this side we'll go with that and you got that in between then you got a consituation you got to consider you got an in between you don't have to face the world and then you just gotta face christ and he'll face the world for you guess what he's already come with the recipe to success he's already come with the recipe to success you just have to follow it you just have to follow it you say you know someone bakes a cake someone who probably doesn't know we're going to go with someone who doesn't have the experience and they decide they're going to put a cup of salt and a teaspoon of sugar guess what it's not going to be edible but if they would have stuck with the recipe they would have been a cup of sugar and a pinch of salt yeah you see but they went out on their own and they said oh we're gonna go make this up and it guess what you can't you can't look at it a cake do cake you have two cakes one with a cup of sugar one with a cup of salt there is no difference on the outside a taste of the goodness of god and come and see you gotta taste it don't go out tasting the world that's not what i'm saying you got to take that and you're going to say does it line up with the word of god does it line up amen praise the lord i'm going to leave that there i don't know where that one was going but anyways you can't tell the difference between the two cakes one with a cup of sugar and one with a cup of salt but christ have him taste it first have him be the taste tester right even it's a god taking and dividing because they look the same oh my goodness saints of god it looks the same it looks the same right now and there's more than one thing that's the same right now there's there's there's there's there's well there's camps there's good preachers preaching an idea over here and there's good preachers preaching an idea over here and they contradict you can almost tell them preaching at each other where is it at where's the fire of god what's right there's truth in both but what is god bringing forth what is god because this is what you've got to we're back to the candlesticks but you gotta you got to have that light burning inside guess what you try to go into the sanctuary without that lamplight you're not gonna find the showbread in the dark but you get christ in the midst you get christ in the midst there's going to be fire to find the truth christ will lead us into all truth and when he came in the first age in the ephesian church age and he put up the sanctuary where was the sanctuary in god's truth for that age then the second age came and it the third edge and it got darker and it got darker but god still had a fire burning in his sanctuary the spiritual sanctuary he had set up for the bride the bride in each of those age so that they could find truth it was darkness outside guess what you'll be inside the tent it's dark outside but you have the light burning to show you the way you have the light burning to show you the table that is set with the show bread so that you can partake of christ what did john a type of the blood have to do eat the book you have to eat you have to eat that book you have to eat the show bread what is the book it's christ you have to take christ oh it's so sweet in your mouth what is bitter in your belly why because then you have to take that and you have to live that out amen if you are standing in the midst of the sanctuary for christ amen underneath the pressure underneath the pressure you will still shine forth the life of christ because you have something that will stand amen and that's something that will stand is jesus christ the holy ghost inside of you that oil and though the winds will blow against the tent that fire will never go out as long as the holy spirit is the source of that flame amen 1960 the thyroid iron churches now we find out that he also got hidden manna now hidden manna is typed to the showbread the showbread was for priests alone that is right showbread was just for the priest it was a special thing made for the priest that is the leaders and this man overcome the whole congregation god manna but he got a hidden special man like about the priest or a special revelation some people get upset talking about special revelation message i just read it to you of who jesus was and what about about him all about him see he got the revelation of he got that revelation if he had overcome to the angel so in other words outside of the sanctuary manna was fallen listen we're talking about the camp of israel we're talking about we're not talking about canaan and the moabites and the ammonites we're not talking about the denominations we're talking about the camp of israel inside the camp of israel is the truth inside the church notice i the church not the lodges inside the church is the truth and the man is falling but the manna falling outside of the sanctuary that god has put in place for the bride spoils overnight yeah it can't keep it oh you went to this these meetings and there was revival and there was man of fallen tell your bucket was overflowing but if that's all you got nothing wrong with that in it in that day it's gonna feed you in that day guess what i gotta eat every day i don't eat every day i'm gonna die but i take that man from that that that manna that fell from heaven that that that great anointing of the flesh and of the spirit i take try to take that home it's not gonna last the night but in that if i'm accepting the man of falling from heaven but i also step inside to the sanctuary i'm double dipping you get it on your on the spirit and you're in joy and rejoicing by the way it's joy it's rejoicing in god in christ you get that on the outside and it it's refreshing fresh manna from heaven refreshing but you step inside the sanctuary now you've got something that'll last the night when darkness comes yea though i walk to the valley of the shadow of death i will fear no evil for thou art with me amen what what's going to take you through the darkness that hidden manna the showbread which is christ so on the outside they had they had an example they had a shadow the moving of the flesh and the spirit is a shadow of the man that's fallen and they'll take that and they'll say we've got the manna look at this i've got six i got four buckets one on each hand and two in between i got all this manna and there you're you're energized and you're rejuvenated but as soon as darkness comes let me tell you a sense of god we're walking in darkness but we have the light we will not over be overcome by the darkness but the light shall overcome the darkness what's going to show you the way through the night the hidden manna which is christ which is the showbread inside and where do you find that in the sanctuary the spiritual sanctuary for the bride you have to step into that place guess what you can't go in there without relationship intimate relationship with christ that's the 10th vision i'll meet you in there that's it the unveiling of god 1964 and it ripens the showbird that we feast on and drive across the country for hundreds of miles see it's the believer's food it's only for a believer remember the show bread was only for the believer only see show bread seed notice what does it do the shekinah glory over the show bed shewbread kept it from spoiling so you say oh i don't understand why did they leave the message i don't understand why were they were they on fire for god and now they're not darkness came and they didn't have the light to find their way through but guess what god in his grace god in his grace can bring the light for them to find their way back to the spiritual sanctuary for the bride of christ we are not allowed to say who is accepted into the sanctuary as soon as you do you bring strange fire outside of this sanctuary okay see i got ahead of my notes so i'm trying to repeat myself see the word of god the word of god is eternal and ever growing ever expanding the showbread guess what it just keeps on giving just keeps on it doesn't ever go out there's always more there's always more there there's always more of that that that food that you need it won't it will never spoil just gets better and better and better my wife has a some of you too some of you other sisters do my has a jar of sourdough starter on her on our counter when she feeds it it just bubbles over she makes another loaf of bread she feeds it it bubbles over she makes another loaf of bread she feeds it it bubbles over why because there's a life inside of it when fed the truth you can't just feed it whatever you want you can't put a celery stick in there nothing's gonna happen you say oh but celery is healthy not for the sourdough starter listening to the tapes is healthy but you gotta pull the food you've got to be the food in the due season which christ has pre-ordained amen it's i don't know that just that was free praise the lord anyway but you got to feed the sourdough starter the right thing for it to bring forth more abundance of life and then you bake more bread guess what by your fruits you shall know them you're going to be just the fruits just going to be coming off and coming off and coming off because you're feeding it what it needs to be fed which is the word of god praise the lord so no matter what comes around amen that manna a hidden man that will never spoil psalms 63 verse one you can turn if you like just gonna pull it too fold it up real quick here oh god thou art my god early will i seek thee isn't that just that's so good right there early well i seek thee not after your house is on fire not after you know if if i get termites in my house if i don't seek help early i'm going to be calling a builder he's going to have to come it's going to cost me three times as much 10 times as much money nowadays to rebuild this section of my house that fell down for the but as if i'm watching my house and watching it i'm inspecting it constantly i'll see the termites when they first come and i'll call the pest control and they'll treat those termites before they can have an effect on my house but if i'm not inspecting my house daily there may be termites eaten away and i don't know it until the house comes crashing down psalm 63 when i will seek the lord early early will i seek thee my soul thirst us thirst death for thee in other words he's seeking him early because he's he's he's thirsty you know you can be so dehydrated you're you know unhealthy and not even be thirsty when you're getting electrolytes and you're keeping yourself hydrated you will be thirsty in time to drink the water you need to stay healthy but if you go past a certain point you i'm not thirsty you haven't had water in you know 12 hours but when you keep thirsty when you keep the salt or the electrolytes in your body then you will be thirsty so when you keep close to god when you keep in the sanctuary of god you're thirsty for him so as soon as something goes wrong you go straight to him my flesh longeth for thee in a dry and thirsty land where no water is are we in the dry and thirsty land yes the answer is yes there is no water out there to see thy power and thy glory so as so as i have seen thee in the sanctuary because thy loving kindness is better than life my lips shall praise thee thus will i bless thee while i live i will lift up my hands in thy name my soul shall be satisfied as with marrow and fatness and my mouth shall praise thee with joyful lips when i remember thee upon my bed and meditate on thee in the night watches because thou has been my help therefore in the shadow of thy wings will i rejoice where are you going to find joy in your life you're lacking joy in your life where are you going to find it the shadow of the wings of christ aka the spiritual sanctuary for the bride brother brown says in the inter intervale 1956 if you walk into a a little fellowship with the church again with that again there's seven golden candlesticks where the offering was only made and the sacrifice burned okay you'll still have smoky days and rainy days cloudy days and days when the lights was out days in the lamp smoked up the experience you've seen miss jones over there who was supposed to be a christian do something that wasn't right and you say oh i wonder if there's anything to to it what did i say earlier oh the whole message is bad because of these miss jones out here you still got your eyes on miss jones see you're still walking with artificial light but the man who walked in behind that holiest of holies it didn't matter whether the sunshine or not what's going to get you through the storm the source of light didn't matter whether the candles burned or not he lived in the light of the chicago where the pillar of fire dwelt under the interlocked wings of the cherubim the shadow of his wings and all the time he was walking in the perfect light and fellowship he didn't look out to the outside to the rainy days you noticed the tabernacle of the woodland didn't have windows there's a reason you don't need to be looking out there you don't you don't need to know if it's raining there's only one window in the ark and look up you don't even know if the floods are still going you don't need to be concerned with the turmoil outside of here seem to be focused on one thing and that's christ because he will give you everything you need listen if you need to know they signed a bill christ will show you amen there was never a rainy day never a doubt never a time that he was hungry for god there's nothing wrong with keeping up in the times i'm not saying that i'm just saying don't get so caught up in that that that's all you're focusing on because then you're going to be walking around a nervous wreck full of anxiety because the world's ending guess what yes there is never a rainy day never a doubt never a time that he was hungry for god because in him was stored up the man of god the word built up into a righteous foundation he had not to worry no more certainly not he was inside the world was on the outside i was thinking of this of this thought that the spiritual sanctuary for the bride and i have to be honest i got a bit of a cozy feeling you know whenever whenever you you know you've been into a storm in it and it sounds silly because the tent is is really not much protection but you're inside a tent and it's storming and it's raining it's cozy inside the tent you're protected from the weather and that's how it is with christ it's storming out there it's crazy out there they're gonna come up with some new thing that's just gonna blow your mind but guess what you're safe and cozy you curl up in the fire with a cup of tea the spiritual sanctuary for the bride goshen right different words same thing goshen the spiritual sanctuary for the bride tabernacle of the wilderness spiritual sanctuary for the bride being in christ coming to church coming to church this is a safe place for you to connect with god god it's a it's a preordained foreordained position that god has has told you to fulfill go to church like they said you shall be streaming two shall be left nothing against our streamers i know there's some that you know your cousin didn't want that it doesn't have a choice this is how it is sometimes god will lead you to what you need chapter eight he that hath the key of david this beautiful phrase follows and comes out of the preceding phrase he that is true christ the perfect realization contrasted with partial realization this is the chapter 8 church book here it is moses was a prophet of god but jesus like unto moses was the prophet this is the long quote but i think it just really caps us off tonight and we're closing here in a little bit so moses was a prophet of god but jesus like unto moses was the prophet of god david a man after god's own heart was king of israel but jesus is the greater david king of kings the lord of lords god very god now david was born of the tribe of judah out of whom no priests came yet he ate of the showbread reserved for priests he was the great warrior overcoming the enemy establishing the people as king he sat on the throne he was a prophet he was a wonderful type of christ now it says in isaiah 22 22 and the key of the house of david will lay upon his shoulder so he shall open and none shall shut and he shall shut and none shall open the spirit uses this old testament reference concerning the lord jesus christ and his ministry in the church what the key of david signified at that time is a mere shadow which is now fulfilled in jesus standing in the midst of the lamp stands it has to do with our lord after his resurrection and not his earthly pilgrimage what does this key signify the answer lies in the position of the king it is not in his hand it is not worn around his neck it is not placed in the hands of other men or the verse could not be saying that he alone has the use of that key for he alone opens and shuts and no man has the right but jesus himself it's not right but where is the key it is on his shoulder but what does shoulder have to do with it read isaiah 9 6 stay with me i know it's long and the government shall be upon his shoulder but what does this mean the answer is this the phrase government upon his shoulder comes from the wedding ceremony of the east when the bride has been committed to the groom she takes off her veil and places it over the groom's shoulders signifying that not only is is she under his dominion that she has transferred her rights to him that he is the head but also that he bears the responsibility glory i could shout on that right now he bears the responsibility it's not up to you saints of god it is not up to you all you have to do is lay the veil upon his shoulder and he takes all responsibility he takes all concern he takes all situations he takes whether or not this is strange fire or truth upon his shoulders all you have to do is get in there with him so he goes on to say he says responsibility and the care and that he and he alone no one else no other man no other power has any right and responsibility but you have to give it to him amen and that beloved is the key of david god being sovereign he foreknew by divine decree exactly who would be his bride he chose her she did not choose him he called her she did not come on her own he died for her he washed her in his own blood he paid the price for her she belongs to him and to him alone she is wholly committed to him and he accepts the obligation he said ruth i will redeem you the other one said i can't it'll mar my my inheritance but boaz says i can do it i can redeem you no one else but christ can redeem you no one else can see you through this age but christ who has redeemed you as she is wholly committed to him and he accepts the obligation she he is her head for christ is the head of his church as sarah called abraham lord even so the bride is happy that he is her lord you make him happy you make him happy amen or the bride is happy i'm sorry i read that wrong but you do make him happy when you accept his request when you when you accepted his invitation amen you completed him amen there is no christ without mrs jesus christ it's the bride it's the whole completion that's the whole point of the of the whole thing as sarah called abraham lord even so the bride is happy that he is her lord he speaks and she obeys for that is her delight amen it is our delight to serve our husband jesus christ but there's only one place you can do that and it's the place he set up the spiritual sanctuary for the bride what's one of the first things you know people women especially women when they leave the message they chop their hair off because they could never accept the headship of christ amen and it's a type amen it's a time what is that what did the denominational churches started to do back when brother brandon was was here on earth they started cutting their hair the women did and then rejecting the headship of christ amen when you don't accept god's god's headship amen you share your glory because it's with christ that your filthy rags have been made righteousness it's with christ that you have glory in the kingdom of god but as soon as you reject the hardship of christ you separate yourself from your glory amen amen and now you have no part until you can get back to a place where you can step in and say i surrender and lay the veil upon his shoulder the veil amen what is it what what happens when you don't have revelation of christ your eyes are veiled but god has come and by accepting his his request his his his desire will you marry me when he got down then when he got down on the ground when he laid his life down you accepted his invitation and then he took the veil from your eyes amen now you're able to see him clearly and now without see when you're veiled you can't have an intimate relationship until the veil is removed he removes the veil from your eyes you see christ for who he is and then and now you can go inside the tent the spiritual sanctuary and accept christ except the show bread there's light i mean there's nothing more romantic than a candlelight dinner you'll find that inside the spiritual sanctuary for the bride musicians want to come tonight so what's the whole what is it you must live within the spiritual sanctuary for the bride that's where you're gonna find safety when the storms blow people come up with doctrines or you see things that you don't understand or even just life happens you're gonna find safety in the spiritual sanctuary and inside that place and then you'll get a relationship with christ and it is that relationship that's going to give you the hidden manner that will not spoil in the darkness amen but the way one the way you have to what you have to do to step into there you have to move aside all your secrets you got to lay all your secrets down everything you thought you would be or you hoped you would be you have to put into christ [Music] amen [Music] [Applause] [Music] i'm going to try to find this song [Music] i get full

to the marriage if we say yes and you said will you marry me did we accept that request god when it's all been said and done our treasures on earth they'll mean nothing father but did we live for true love which is christ did we live for you lord [Music] not do we get that job or do we get that promotion or do we go to to travel to this place and do this none of that matters when it's all been said
