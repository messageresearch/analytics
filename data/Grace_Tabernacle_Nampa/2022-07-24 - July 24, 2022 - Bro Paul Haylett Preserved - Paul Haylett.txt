you glad we can sing that today amen because it's not just people we go to church with but it's the family of god amen and i'm so glad to be part of the family of god today amen so glad to have each and every one of you the house of god today and just a special time for us to be able to come together worship the lord reach out claim all the promises of god as it's laid out before us we we don't have to pick and choose right we can just simply say i believe the word of god and if it hurts a little bit we say thank you lord if it blesses us we say thank you lord and we just keep moving forward amen come on brother sister we just have this little blessing amen aren't you glad i love those sister alice that was beautiful thank you for singing that amen because he's never gave what a testimony

has never gave up on me and i say thank you lord amen and sister beth i feel like that both of those special songs fit right with our thought today because you see in the best and worst of times yeah there's something in us we're not fair-weather worshippers we are rock solid our lord jesus said peter upon this rock amen and that anointing of the word of god coming in our lives makes us rock solid and good times and bad times and baby times which are good times and bad times amen our dear little deanna amen what a beautiful gorgeous little baby she loves mom and dad so much she sings to him in the midnight hours she just wants to tell him how much she loves them and how thankful she is and we are amen because you realize no matter what the condition is every gift of god is perfect god has never given you and i a gift that was deficient in any fashion that's why each one of us is who we are unique because god loves that bouquet of his people and uh we're so thankful today our beautiful little baby god has blessed my brother vasily my sister tomah amen with the firstborn and we pray as the lord would lead and maybe their family just continued to grow and to remember these times of this and i think i i didn't get to hold her the other day and we'll just amen look at this gorgeous little girl is she not beautiful these blue eyes are so incredible you know i remember one time was just joking about eye color and and i made some comment about brown being great my brother looked at me because all his children had bright blue eyes and said brother you're just muddy water blue eyes are the clear blue sky and god doesn't deal in muddy water he deals in clear blue sky and i was like that's not fair but look at this gorgeous gorgeous baby amen i'd just like to say thank you lord for the blessing and i want to say thank you lord for brother vasily sister thomas life they just keep pressing on we're not perfect but god's taking us into perfection amen so we're all a part of that beautiful plan of god amen let's just let's just praise the lord and just dedicate this beautiful baby heavenly father lord as we come today we come with thanksgiving lord in abundance in our hearts for father truly you have blessed us blessed us beyond measure lord to be of part of the family of god and to see the miracle of life and coming forth and spiritual life father lord we seek we long for we press it and lord equally father natural life lord our dear little deanna father lord we just ask you lord father as you would just be upon her life lead her father guide her protector

protect her and bless her all the days of her life we pray filler with the holy spirit lord we ask this in your precious name amen can we just say thank you lord amen a little blessing hallelujah look she just smiled at me and amen i don't know i won't say this in church but there's two reasons children smile amen look at this look at this she's in love with me hallelujah can we just give a handclap of praise for this beautiful little girl amen hallelujah yes you amen god bless you sister thomas brother of the ceiling god bless you my brother hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah thank you lord just got a couple things i'd like to touch on before we go into the service don't forget communion it's on the board back there we're gonna try and be more faithful to get things on the board and uh for those of you that would have a desire to help in some fashion with sunday school we also have a sheet there for you to look at and of course we all know there's a fellowship after the service today brother george texted me very early this morning just desiring your prayers he's in africa the lord is blessing the services and he's just going to be some traveling now and and just was asking the church to remember him amen and of course we i believe brother sergey was necessary we talked to him the other evening and he would like to have been here today but it was necessary for him to be on the road today so just remember him in prayer and anyone who is not here today just as you look around and say i see brother or sister pray for them amen we never know the circumstance and just lift them up to the lord amen i want to speak to you on our position of strength and you know very simple thought today i pray the lord would just bless it but i want to speak to you on preserved amen i believe both of the special songs that we had today are a testimony of the fault that we had to speak today because you see there is no ability within ourselves there's nothing that we can do in the time of trouble when the enemy comes in like a flood we do not raise the standard even though it could be said that we're part of that process but it is not us that raises a standard but it is our lord jesus christ and so as we look at this all through our life if you just stop for a moment young and old and just ponder what god has done for you everything my brother and sister that is good in our life you say but the world out here they have the same things but you have to understand that satan is not going to fight as it were against his own even though he tends to try to punish his own because it's his nature right he can't be nice to anyone and uh but typically you'll find that the minute you start proclaiming as a son or daughter of god that the word is open to you that the life of christ has been poured into you that god's dwelling in you satan then comes and he pushes against that and a whole barrage of fiery darts of the enemy then rained down upon the bride of christ and so we recognize that that it is god that's keeping us it's the holy ghost that is preserving us in the hour that we live in amen and so as we look at this you know truly this is why i thought it was special sister alice of your song because you see if we have not strength of our own to stand in this hour and i think we can say amen to that it's not our strength and if we don't have strength of our own to stand in this hour then there must be some strength and where did it come from amen it's god pouring his preserving power which we could identify today as the holy ghost and he's pouring his uh power into us a holy ghost into us that we're able to stand in the worst of times amen now the prophet of god said that the day we're living in is the most wicked of all the ages it's the accumulation of all wickedness of the days it's brought down and you say but they had this in that day and they had that in that day that's right so there's nothing new under the sun but they didn't have a computer they didn't have an ipad and they didn't have you might say such a liberal spirit upon the world to pour it out upon even our little children talking to a man the other day he made a statement he says you know uh you go to school to pick up your little granddaughter and uh you're a little bit early but you walk in get a collector right at the classroom and you can't believe your ears that's the age we live in with no recourse and i'll try and tie this by god's grace then because you see the world doesn't look at that school system and that teacher is fanatical they look at you as a fanatic that you actually care about the heart and soul of your children grandchildren what's wrong with you aren't you progressive well my brother and sister not to get into politics but you see that's what the devil was in the garden preaching a progressive message to eve by which she could circumvent the word of god by twisting the words or leaving them out right back to eden again that's what the prophet taught us we're right back to eden again coming right into the house of god trying to preach a progressive message or the lack of but god by his grace and mercy said i've already put the preservative amen i've already done everything it's necessary to keep my own amen aren't you glad this morning let's stand and go into the word of god i want to turn to second timothy the fourth chapter verses 16 to 18. and in this i i actually it's verse 18 but i just wanted to catch a little bit of the groundwork now this is a letter of paul to timothy and uh you know paul's ministry was not without controversy not without conflict not without persecution and not without blessing amen second timothy 4 16 at my first answer no man stood with me so here's paul as it is standing alone on the word of god but all men forsake me forsook me i pray god that it may not be laid to their charge now this my brother and sister let me just interject when people come against you they besmirch your name they speak all manner of evil the scripture says against you the word does not say retaliate the word says to paraphrase lift them up to the presence of god amen now do you realize they may never change but it will change you and sometimes that's actually what prayer does it doesn't change the situation but it brings us peace and understanding and compassion within the situation [Music] that's good you know jesus said he's without sin cast the first stone and i want to say he who's without attitude be the first to judge yeah so we've all been there but by god's grace we're being able to step beyond it amen notwithstanding the lord stood with me can someone say amen and strengthen me that by me the preaching might be fully known and that all the gentiles might hear now that the world we live in today in its totally all boundaries and all guidelines are gone there are now preachers on the face of the earth that are saying we don't like paul's attitude imagine this many years from when this was preached now they have a crisis of paul's attitude because we're now believing that paul might have been narcissistic yeah it was all about paul hallelujah but do you catch these saints they're totally in this day missing the fact that god has always use man we think about how difficult it is imagine how it is for the lord wouldn't it been simpler for him just simply to appoint it a people you you you you you you you're in the millennium but it saved god a lot of time and hassle also wouldn't it but god says you know what satan imagine they're having a friendly conversation i'll prove to you satan i will prove to you that i can have a people and call them out and keep them amen and hold them and lead them and guide them a people not by their own ability but capable this is what paul is saying that's what paul's saying it was by this that god has made me capable to preach this gospel that it would come from the jews to the gentiles and hold them in that that the gentiles might hear and i was delivered out of the mouth of the lion and the lord shall deliver me from every evil work and i would like you to repeat that with me and the lord shall deliver me from every evil work and will preserve me into his heavenly kingdom to whom be glory forever and ever amen can we just give a little thanksgiving to the lord hallelujah amen i believe this word i claim this word amen the lord shall deliver me do you know that the word shall actually is is a very interesting word because it is past present and future amen and that's what it is jesus christ the same yesterday today and forever heavenly father we just ask you to bless this time together lord just bless our our dear little dionna father lord jesus just touch her all the days of her life lord give wisdom to her parents lord and just strengthen that family as a unit father we pray in your name amen you may be seated saints hallelujah you know i heard the brother put it this way once as he was dedicating a baby he said this is just the prelude of the privilege we'll have to baptize her in the name of jesus christ this is step one to baptism amen i liked that amen now look at this paul's letter to timothy uh is is there despite all the opposition and all the trouble uh it was it was a a solid word right it's so solid that when uh brother branham is now there speaking and he's on the beyond the curtain of time it wasn't hey do you believe genesis it wasn't uh what about this over here but the comparison come down to paul's ministry and it was that my brother and sister that will work for us today as message believers you know what i'm talking about and so brother branham was assured or give confidence there that if paul's ministry would bring forth a people that would make it amen then by preaching that same gospel we can have confidence today and so as we look at this we realize that that paul did not have as it were you might say some comfortable kind of ministry but god made him in a sense go as it were to start in in the backside of the desert and truly my brother and sister god started paul's ministry he didn't just convert him as it were as a child but allowed him to come out of false doctrine and come into the light of the truth and he come as a one a man taking the lives by his word right his command taking the lives of the saints to bring him to a place that he give his life for the saints and so we see how lovely that is because this is a life completely surrendered to christ amen this was not a life that was just a ministry and and could say for the years i preached but truly a man who gave his entire life to be consumed for the gospel and i want to build upon a foundation if we'll go into psalms here and it is now a beautiful thought my brother and sister the chief musician is psalm of david the servant of the lord the transgression of the wicked saith within my heart that there is no fear of god before his eyes for he flattereth himself in his own eyes now look i i know a lot of you do social media stuff and i'm not going to speak against that today and that's up to you between you and the lord what you what you watch your content how much time you do but i want you to understand that the reason i chose this scripture is because it is a very clear reflection they shall be abundantly satisfied with the fatness of the house and thou shall make them to drink of the river of thy pleasures for with thee there is a fountain of life and in thy light shall we see light oh continue let this verse 10 be a prayer oh continue thy loving kindness unto them that know thee and thy righteousness to the upright in heart you know that song stirs my these these words the psalm i mean serves my heart enough i just want to i just want to shout and sing here is the here's the whole breakdown my brother and sister of what god is doing and and all through scripture we see the two sides right brother branham speaks he says now we see the two spirits in the framework of the christian church now we see all through the scripture these two sides this struggle of the spirits right and we could put it in simple terms as i said this will be a simple thought today simple terms of good and evil but you see sometimes it's not just good enough to be good because there are family saints on the face of this earth that are raising good children that know not the lord there are families that are good people give to charity and help and kind and compassion but know not the lord so it is not simply a matter of being good or being kind but there has to be this other understanding of the struggles of the spirits of the day that we live in and how as the prophet of god said how that satan would desire to come in to destroy you and then he comes in he doesn't always come in in a flood sometimes he comes in so subtle we'll have things creep into our lives that we don't even realize that is happening it is degraded you know you can you can have a laptop and it can just get slower and slower so slow in fact that it won't perform but you realize it does it so slow that you don't realize it doesn't perform until maybe you have a son-in-law that comes in and says hey that should have loaded by now oh no that's just how it works this is the way it's always been well that still don't make it right that's how subtle satan is right he comes in and he degrades in such a fashion that we find ourselves churches now look i'm not i'm not defending or boosting myself or brother david or brother chris not at all but i'm telling you that's why god would place men in our midst this is scriptural place men in our midst and they themselves need to tune up but when god keeps them tuned up they'll look out and they'll want to see you tuned up and so then sometimes hard things are preached direct things are preached forceful things are preached and love is preached and compassion is preached because we have to be balanced and if not we would just slowly come down and this is where the prophets get filled with the fire of almighty god almost wanted to ask the girls to sing that song again this morning i just love that i got fire in my bones amen it's not anointed on my wallet it's not anointed on my business it's not an anointed it's down in my bones it's christ all the way down in the depth of who i am everything that i am is christ and i couldn't do it on my own oh but he said this work i have began in you amen and from the first moment he started to anoint us maybe as a child right to the place that we are right now wait brother paul i backslid yeah i know what you're talking about but i'm telling you he had already placed the ember he had already placed the seed he'd already placed the life and he said i'm not worried oh mama's worried grandma's worried maybe the preacher is worried god said i'm not worried i know what i have begun in them hallelujah but look at this my brother and sister and i say grace tabernacle let us not ever come to the place that lukewarm is an acceptable position in our church in our lives in our families don't accept it in your ministry don't accept it in any position any time or any place but you see it even gets worse than that when the subtle line says you know if you just as i said already got ahead of myself come to church pay your tithes we don't sign books we tend to sign it by hey they come they're faithful everything's all right my family come out before they come in the message come out of a methodist church my dad was good friends with the minister and later in life i became good friends with him on the basis of preaching funeral this man spoke to my dad and said david you were doing really good your family was faithful in church and you got a good family isn't or wasn't that enough come on that's right we could make a declaration this morning that's enough but what would it do it would destroy your church and i'm not talking about this building i would be talking about our souls and our position in the lord just doing this is enough no my brother and sister it's not enough if we're not on fire nothing short of being on fire is sufficient but satan would bring it that we would get to the place i'm faithful in church everything's cool i give i support my family or whatever it might be do you know in the age you'll see this in this interesting we see a lot of celebrity type people on the earth today becoming christians it's cool your eyes it's cool to be christian but you want to see where the real foundation of this is satan has made it cool to be a christian but you don't see their life change so now what it projects is satan very clever what he's projecting is you can be a christian without any kind of change well i can tell you you can be cold without any kind of change but you can't be a christian without any kind of change now you look in the world that we're living in today and it is actually cool to be cold or turn that around cold is cool responsible to nothing is a new norm think about it and everybody says oh this is the age of the identity they forgot to put the word crisis on the end of that this is the age of the crisis we're being an island come on saints we don't want to get satan satan will bring you to a place where this actually will apply to you and if you're not careful you won't even recognize it where being an island to oneself is seen as normal if you want i can take you in the word of god that says we were called to a body and you didn't leave your arm at home today because it annoyed you you didn't leave your leg at home because it didn't want to get in the car you didn't do all of that we're a body and if you want to do we can go write in the message we can go right into scripture if you need that reminder that we're a body and one part of the body cannot isolate itself from the rest of the body and say all is well i hope that didn't hurt anybody's feelings but we're in a world where being an island to oneself is considered normal and self-identity is considered to be brave think about what's going on in a world they're they're such heroes i just listened to deal the other day i was like why in the world paul did you even listen to that thing they were explaining why this new generation of people under this they don't use the word anointing or spirit because they don't really think there's anything there but they're so brave i'm not trying to mock or just do something for humor but in an interesting sense how you have all these people that say i i've got my own identity i don't want to be i don't know got my own identity but when you see this oh thank you lord you don't think this is all relevant saints a prophet of god sees a vision beyond the curtain of time and what does he see he sees the saints of the ages and they're coming and they're walking in orderly fashion and they're marching to onward christian soldier but there's another group who thinks they have their own identity but they don't realize they're walking in an order with another group and they're just like them amen you know there was this man asked a young man all respect he says sir young man can i ask you a question and he said sure actually very polite young man but serious why do you dress like you do right bright red bloomers with his pants cinched underneath his bum why do you dress like that it's my identity he said here i've been walking on the streets of the city today and i just want you to go through here and just count these pictures of all these people that have the exact same identity you have my belt is different okay no problem we can do that but you see what has happened the spirit of the age all caught up but the greatest factor of this is the crisis that goes with it am i boring you to death amen so look at this now this is an age we live in that the program has replaced the power we have great programs come on sir church we we if we're not careful we say well we're we're separated from them no if we're not careful we'll give a program have a program that will replace and i say there is no replacement for the fire of god there's no replacement for the holy ghost in our life but we can have a program that will work you know vacation bible school they just touted it here some time back of how many years that it's been around and how effective it is but my brother and sister year after year vacation bible school is teaching the interpretation of the bible according to the people who are teaching it and i'm not saying all of that is evil don't misunderstand me but you realize train up a child what get them when they're young get them when they're young and they will not depart out of the teaching unless the holy ghost comes amen i'll tell you i still to this day rejoice of the preaching of our brother gideon retief when he was talking about breaking the cycle hallelujah you cannot get no don't get old in a tizzy saints that you know we come out of this we come out of that what about our children i'm telling you we serve a god that's here to break the cycle you say here and say well our family is like this right here break the cycle let god break the sign our family is dysfunctional break the cycle don't perpetuate it don't claim it don't make it a declaration my family's dysfunctional my family's this my family is that break that cycle and we can do that by stepping into the word and my brother and sister the refining fire comes down and it burns the dross out of you and i we don't have to say well i'm sorry i carry my family heritage with me no step in the fire let the fire burn that off of you the holy ghost will take that out it'll take away an old irish temper it'll take away a family that is easy to give up well we can't do this it'll break that speaker where you can stand up and say you know what it's not by my family heritage i'll make a rapture it's not by my grandpa or what he was or what has been down from the 1600s 17 18 19 2000 it's not that it's going to put you in a rapture it's the power of almighty god our father our father that's the heritage that god is calling us why because he promised in his word he would preserve you and where the seed is he's made the promise i will preserve that seed and i will bring forth a people as he's speaking to abraham i'll bring forth the people as and people say well israel is not that big he wasn't talking about israel he was talking about a spiritual seed and i serve a god that would cause our eyes to turn from our own earthly carnal things and turn to the word of god and say i'm a son of god i'm a daughter of god i believe that i confess that i'm gonna project that i'm not going to project defeated to make a rapture because the word said and i believe that the word spoke to me amen you know brother brown said he's walking from the well with a bucket of water buckets of water and he got there at the tree in a whirlwind in a tree and a voice spoke to him and people would say that's utter nonsense that's just so outlandish maybe it's not a bucket of water in your hand and maybe it's not even a tree but to those of you that god has spoken to amen in the depths of your soul somebody say i don't believe in such nonsense you have to come to realization don't don't lower yourself right you know with the old phrase they say you know don't argue don't wrestle with a pig you'll both get dirty and he liked it don't go down there if they can't believe don't go down there but that don't take away from me what i know what god did for me they don't take away from me what god's done in my soul and what he spoke down in the very depths of my soul it only changed one iota god never spoke to them amen never move them in the spirit then my heart aches for them i'm not going to criticize them but my heart aches for him because we as a people have been led by the spirit of god amen and where the word has been made alive revelation the spirit of god is there to guide his people amen without that leadership hey what are we just another religion i'm not interested in religion amen look program replaces power or cold and formal is seen as sophisticated now you know some of you might think oh paul you must waste a lot of time and i might but sometimes it spurs me on reviews of a church how many of you looked up at church and looked at their reviews how many of you are just crazy enough waste your time that way when someone declares a church as sophisticated and they mean it as a compliment kind of makes you wonder how many sophisticated is there amongst us today those of you that come out of the highway and the byway and the alleys you miss the church lesson on sophistication i did too because after looking at that thought i couldn't find it because god chose only one you might say this is not actual drive it down home but my tax collector actually kind of sophisticated he had to be able to deal with the authorities at the same token he had to get tough with those people like gabriella yaomi 17.62 cents pay up in the name of the lord oh she just used a tap card good i guess you're paid out you see we're not called to be sophisticated in fact quite the opposite they come out of the upper room staggering around everybody says they're drunk on new wine well they were drunk all right and i want to get drunk like that i want to live in that world where i can get in the spirit of god so much that i'm not dependently isn't this once again the two spirits identified right in the word and then we have to decide whether you want someone to ste what joy in life you have but you notice what the devil says he says you go to church and man they just they're no fun they steal all the joy out of life what's your version of joy what's your version of life right but even then the devil will come and steal it [Music] i love history i was reading some history of man but they would partake in a vice like smoking a cigar and die early in their life from throat cancer so the devil anoints them to use their knowledge for warfare in this case he was a general in the army to do great things to write books on tactics of the enemy are you with me and then he himself fall to a tactic of the enemy come on saints let's not get it to where we can testify of god sent a prophet this is this this is that serve god do this but not a seed that's been hybridized but a seed that is back to the true original word of god amen that seed god said i will preserve amen he's speaking to abraham i'll preserve your seed your seed's not going to make it to the 21st century to the age we call laodicea it's not going to make it to a time of the great deceit and fall away then i will preserve your seed your seed will be there at the coming of the lord hallelujah let me hurry along here amen so we see the contrast amen now look what a contrast that is in the day we live in it is not how much knowledge we possess do you realize saints now i'm not speaking down on myself most of you think oh brother paul's just okay brother paul's dumber than a rock and i'm not degrading myself i'm telling you you know you know how you know i've done this before and felt embarrassed you know you're out after church you know it's like oh praise the lord you know somebody's like now brother paul that scripture now what was that scripture i don't remember you know how you feel my old age brother david problem was i was 40 when i started that but do you realize saints god didn't say i'm going to save you because you have a memory i'm not going to save you because you're smarter than the average bear i'll save you because you have this or you have that i'll save you because i jesus christ amen lord god almighty jehovah el shaddai place the seed down in you and i'll save you because that seed had life and it's my life i placed in you before there ever was even an earth a foundation of the earth was hallelujah i used to be embarrassed about that but i realized i don't care whether people think i'm smart or not don't think whether i can this or i can that what i know hey come on there's a few things i know and one thing i know is it work that god began in me he has promised to finish hallelujah i can stand on that i can hang my soul and the soul of my family and of my children and my grandchildren and of the saints of almighty god that this work he said i'm going to preserve you now we're not being preserved like a bunch of old pickles sit in a jar and everybody that's close to me is going to frown when they're all done they're going to pucker up when they're done i'm proud of this i contain great pucker power no sir we ought to be living such a life saint that when people get close to you something if they're struggling a little bit something in them comes to life something comes up and says you know what my god is real i see god working in them and i know the same god is in me that is in them and lord let it come to life and when it comes to life it's life-changing hallelujah why because he said i would preserve you amen and he didn't promise to do it with formaldehyde he promised to do it with the holy ghost he promised to do it with the power of his very life his life in you and i is our preservative oh hallelujah it's not how long our church has been to church come on i'll tell you the silliness that's even around our ranks is somebody said well we had a new family moved to town and i said oh they go to your church no they went over to the other one and i don't know why they would because we've been around in this city for 50 years that other church has only been there for a couple i felt so bad because these thoughts in my head were like someday i need to visit this other church yeah because you're living like a rubbernecker when did your church start where we laid the first stone on this day at this time we laid the next stone at this time and we did this at this time okay when was the time that the holy ghost fell in your church 1978. i'm going to the other church that's right now i say that jokingly saints but let not grace tabernacle be the kind of church that's looking back of what it was we came from here and we did this and we are this and we've done that and our family knew this and our family knew them and come on i want a god that's present this morning i want a preserving power to fall in this building this morning and touch our children and touch our old people that we can stand and say you know what this message i believe this is a ever-present god in the time of my trouble and that means he's right here oh hallelujah i'd like to say it a little blunter but i don't think i will hallelujah what is it a very present god the fire of the holy ghost what does it do it turns a church on fire it burps the dross out it burns all the little false ideas well you know i was taught the prophet says this and said that and that's what we built our church on i'll tell you what i want to do i want to build my church that i go to not my church as it was but you know what i'm saying i want to build it on this hallelujah and it's ever present in other words if you're kind of feeling bummed you've got some hard things in your life and you say but i don't know i just kind of depressed i don't say this lightly saints and i don't know which way to turn and i don't know what to do and turn back to the fire go back to the fire do you realize that if they had called shadrach and meshach up the next week and made the same offer to them they would have went back to the fire and the next month and the next year of all the days of their life they would have been made that offer forsake him they just said send us to the fire you realize the devil you realize the devil's using all these things as it were a threat against you you're not a very good christian you had an outburst anybody had an outburst lately oh well a few of you are courageous amen i pray the lord give some more of you courage [Laughter] amen sister diane i love an honest heart i i managed sister diane just barely in time to bite my tongue it was just right there just but sometimes we miss and we don't get our tongue bit the devil what's he going to try and do i know you were on fire for the lord a year it too hallelujah well i'm telling you i'm not worried about it saints god promised he'd seal me my family my children it's seal us the spirit of laodicea the spirit of all of this is bound by the holy ghost hallelujah oh i'm not saying maybe some of us might have a little something but he's given us the power of preservation he gave us the holy ghost he's gave us his life he poured his spirit out on us don't sit here and be afraid i'm going to lose it don't be afraid it's got away from me claim it the bigger your problem the more louder you ought to proclaim it hallelujah hallelujah oh look at this right amen first corinthians 12 1 and 12 i mean 12 12 12 through 14. for as a body as one half many members and all the members that one body uh being many are one body so also is christ for by one spirit and we say amen for one spirit we're all baptized into one body whether we be jew or gentile whether we be bond or free and have all been made to drink into one spirit for the body is not one member but many amen and first peter 11 7 hallelujah amen is it all right we hurry right through this amen first peter 11 1-7 we'll skip one there because it but elect right this important we recognize elect according to the foreknowledge of god through sanctification of the spirit unto [Music] not our own thinking not our own idea not our own interpretation not this church not that church i'll tell you my brother and sister god's got one true church amen i don't want to be identified outside of the borders of that one true church and i'm not talking about the four walls that would make like grace to say we're the only ones with it we're talking about the word we're talking about the life we're talking about his spirit amen one true church amen amen what is it i'm lost again [Music] oh yes thank you and to obedience and sprinkling of the blood of jesus christ grace unto you and peace be multiplied blessed be the god and father of our lord jesus christ who according to his abundant mercy hath begotten us again lively can we say that out loud lively not old dead letter church but lively hallelujah i wouldn't i would love just amongst all things it doesn't mean anything but i just would really love one day my brother and sister if the god would be so gracious to us just to see what a real lively spirit falling on a church would cause some of us to do some of us would hear the plaster cracking hallelujah boy some of you didn't like that at all did you don't worry you can replace your pastor later amen to an inheritance now i want you this i want to that's why i couldn't skip over this to an inheritance if something's incorruptible [Music] something that is undefiled that doesn't fade away something had to preserve that something had to keep that from becoming defiled something had to keep that oh my brother and sister i don't care what you own have in this natural world as far as i know right now you even put stainless steel out in the weather and it tarnishes some of the finest metals on earth most anti-corrosive metals on earth but you put them out in the weather and over time it tarnishes [Music] but god called you and he called you out filled you up and sealed you and then he buried you in a bomb shelter no sir what did he do he sent us right back out and he said saints if you just give me this he said you wouldn't be corrupted and you wouldn't be defiled and you won't fade away no apathy in the bride what is it because he's reserved this in heaven for you hallelujah aren't you glad god's got a reservation amen it didn't come down we're not delta airlines hoping that the next flight's gonna go we're not there wondering if this is going to be walking in the grocery store remember the great things of the pandemic you know walk in the grocery store 42 times burnt 200 worth of gas going to the store to find one package of toilet paper do you realize these spirits are all systematic of the world we live in people oh this is going to sound kind of judgmental as we close people going to church over and over and over again they're looking for something but they can't find it but the word of god said whatever your expectation is now look at this didn't put it on necessarily what the church had didn't put it on how good the preacher preached and long-winded or short or how confusing he was prophet of god said what you get will be your expectation [Music] come on if you know you're going to be blessed you're going to come looking for a blessing if you're looking to mark an attendance record you can mark your attendance record if you're looking to be part of the program and you're not worried about power you can satisfy that what is it we want what is it i tell you the holy ghost has preserved us and we're here and i believe just reading prophet of god talking about what the future would be and how some of these things had come and i just love this when the prophet of god said may these young men lord pick up this message come on somebody going to pick it up when he uses men remember what brother stephen brought it out so beautifully as a reminder when he said men it was inclusive right it's not just men you say but our sister's picking up the message i sure hope so because if they don't pick it up there's no hope for our children there's no hope for as the scripture says the elder women teaching the younger women there's no hope for those things to be fulfilled so god brought this word down and laid it out that there's going to be some people can somebody say i think i'm a people amen are you bots or people going to pick it up what did that do required effort required energy required desire and they're going to carry this right down to the coming of the lord i told brother chris the other day i hope i don't embarrass him told the other day chris just keep going doing that i won't go into our conversation but just do that because you see there'll come a day could come a day i know this sounds a little crass forgive me come a day he might be throwing dirt on my face committing my soul to the lord who's going to carry the word then who's going to pick it up and say we have a standard to carry we have a torch to light we've got a way to walk in and a confession to make and a word to fulfill oh hallelujah i'm sorry saints i just get so excited oh hallelujah oh wait there's more amen there is power power let's just stand up worship the lord for a minute or two before we go enjoy some fellowship together hallelujah look i don't want you to feel sorry for me but i'm telling you if you guys just knew what kind of burden it was to pack this around for a week or two before you can bring it out hallelujah and you wonder how he just won't stop he won't stop no i'm not really just trying to preach for a long time i'm just trying to get unloaded so i can go fill it up again hallelujah would you be free from your burden of sin there's power in the blood i say there's power [Music] there's wonderful power in the block there [Music] power [Music] there's wonderful power [Music] would you be wider [Music] stains are lost in its heart giving [Music] there is [Music] of the land [Music] his praises to sing there's wonderful power in the blood for there is [Music] blood of the lamb can we full praise to the lord hallelujah hallelujah i'll tell you what some of you go to the store and you pick up a jar you turn it around you look at the label now i'm not speaking ill of this [Music] some salt doctor says sodium's bad until it isn't and it's got sodium bicarbon yeah anyway whatever that is it's got this it's got sugar in it [Music] you know what the devil's trying to do get you to take this word read the ingredients of it and decide whether or not it's good for you [Music] wants me to change my thinking wants me to change my attitude i like my attitude i take it everywhere i go wants me to change this once primary ingredient [Music] come on saints don't let the devil cause you to put deliverance back on the shelf and walk away because it's hard the preservative has been mixed in in the proper level [Music] don't become what we would really call a fanatic because you think jump and shout and scream is going to be the answer [Music] but by the same token don't put that on the shelf because i would be ashamed if god got a hold of me and i lifted my hands and i cried out and i screamed and i shouted oh heaven forbid that ever happened well probably would come on saints take what god give us take the word in let the word liberally did you know the last few years i finally i have to admit this i've become a liberal i want a liberal application liberal dose of the holy ghost i want a liberal power of god to deliver me i want all of these things that the word has to be applied to me liberally i don't want just enough to change me we're going to bless the food and well praise god heavenly father lord you know my heart is overflowing father how these things have been upon my heart just a little tidbit here
