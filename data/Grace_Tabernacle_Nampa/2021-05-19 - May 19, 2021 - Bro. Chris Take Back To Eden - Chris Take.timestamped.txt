[27:31] our bibles
[27:38] we'll start in genesis chapter 3.
[27:56] genesis chapter 3 verse 20.
[28:03] and adam called his wife's name eve
[28:05] because she was the mother of all living
[28:08] unto adam also and to his wife did the
[28:10] lord god make coats of skins
[28:12] and clothe them and the lord god said
[28:14] behold the man has become as one of us
[28:17] to know good and evil and now lest he
[28:20] put forth his hand and take also
[28:22] the tree of life and eat and live
[28:24] forever
[28:25] therefore the lord god sent him forth
[28:28] from the garden of eden to till the
[28:30] ground from whence he was taken
[28:32] so he drove out the man and he placed at
[28:35] the east of the garden of eden cherubims
[28:38] and a flaming sword which turned every
[28:41] way to keep the way of the tree of life
[28:44] let's bow our heads heavenly father lord
[28:47] we ask that you would come and have your
[28:48] way
[28:49] tonight in our midst lord father prepare
[28:52] the bedding ground lord for the

[29:45] we pray father
[29:46] we'll just step aside and allow you to
[29:48] speak tonight in jesus christ's name we
[29:50] pray
[29:51] amen may be seated tonight
[29:55] so as you may have seen uh my title
[29:58] title tonight
[29:59] is back to eden
[30:03] amen so we read here in genesis chapter
[30:08] 3 that um is it loud it might little bit
[30:13] loud i think
[30:14] for me appear anyways written in genesis
[30:18] chapter 3
[30:18] we see the start of the story of
[30:22] where we are today because of what
[30:24] happened in the garden of eden
[30:28] we deal with what we deal with on a
[30:29] daily basis
[30:31] and we see the great tragedy in the love
[30:34] story that began in the book of genesis
[30:37] we read about the great things that
[30:38] happened in the garden of eden
[30:40] how adam had dominion over the the
[30:44] the land and the animals and how they
[30:46] walked with the lord every single night
[30:49] and yet eve allowed the serpent to
[30:53] change one thing in the word of god
[30:55] and from that she fell and from that she
[30:58] received the seed of death
[31:00] then she went to adam and adam partzik
[31:02] as well
[31:04] out of his love for eve he was not
[31:05] blinded and then the lord came looking
[31:08] for them
[31:09] and um he always had a quick response
[31:13] before when he said adam and eve where
[31:15] are you guys or adam
[31:16] arthur and they would say we're over
[31:19] here you know and they would fellowship
[31:21] with him but this time
[31:22] no one answered the call and finally the
[31:26] lord
[31:26] finds them and he says you know what's
[31:28] going on and they said oh we know we're
[31:29] naked and
[31:30] that is where we we pick up here in in
[31:33] genesis and so
[31:34] um mankind fell losing
[31:38] the connection they had with god and
[31:40] sent into the human race
[31:42] and then we lost eden uh webster's
[31:46] call uh gives the definition unspoiled
[31:49] paradise
[31:51] amen we cannot duplicate replicate
[31:55] unspoiled paradise they try right the
[31:58] caribbean
[31:59] the bahamas hawaii right
[32:03] paradise you know perfect temperature
[32:05] every every
[32:06] all year long but there's still sin and
[32:09] there's even more sin in those places it
[32:11] seems like
[32:12] a place that mankind says this is going
[32:15] to be it this is the utopia we gotta
[32:17] the politicians get involved and they
[32:19] said we gotta you know go to this
[32:21] new systems of these things and
[32:23] everything will be good you know let's
[32:24] hand out the money and everything we
[32:26] better will create a paradise
[32:28] and the time and time again down through
[32:30] history
[32:31] and then they these things came to
[32:34] nothing they fell apart
[32:35] and many of them ended in tragedy
[32:38] the mormons tried to create their
[32:40] paradise and
[32:42] things did not go well and still don't
[32:44] go well for them
[32:45] and then we have here of the people that
[32:47] go off in the middle of the
[32:49] jungle and then to the paradise and then
[32:52] they all drink the kool-aid
[32:53] so man tries to replicate
[32:56] unspoiled paradise but you cannot
[33:00] achieve unspoiled paradise born of a man
[33:03] in a woman
[33:05] or can you there's something that
[33:08] happens to a child of god that changes
[33:12] them you live inside a spoiled
[33:16] paradise adam and eve had perfect bodies
[33:20] but they became spoiled by sin by
[33:24] mixing with sin and because of that
[33:27] every single one of us are born sons and
[33:31] daughters of god inside but
[33:33] living in a spoiled paradise so this
[33:35] body
[33:36] has potential to be
[33:40] in eden this body has a potential and
[33:43] you have one that's just like
[33:45] it waiting for you you'll put this one
[33:48] aside because this flesh
[33:49] cannot be redeemed but the soul of your
[33:53] of your soul has been redeemed and
[33:56] you'll step
[33:56] from this version of eden
[34:00] into the true eden amen your theophany
[34:03] that's waiting for you
[34:05] so the devil amen he thought he could
[34:08] come in and he thought he could bring it
[34:09] and he's this is
[34:11] satan's eden but unfortunately since the
[34:14] word means unspoiled paradise
[34:17] this is satan's spoiled paradise this is
[34:20] satan's attempt at the version of what
[34:23] god
[34:24] did at the beginning and you say it's
[34:27] kind of like god's the bag said okay
[34:28] satan let's see what you got
[34:30] and he ruined the whole thing amen you
[34:33] have you know you have these these uh
[34:35] these uh arguments and they get kind of
[34:37] political about
[34:38] global warming and different things like
[34:40] that well
[34:41] i don't know how much you want to
[34:42] believe about their rhetoric
[34:45] but the earth isn't doing well
[34:48] the earth is sick because we have
[34:51] perverted
[34:52] we have spoiled god's paradise
[34:55] amen and we you can't help it you were
[34:58] born that way
[34:59] but god has come down and he has a
[35:02] vision in his mind he has a vision in
[35:05] his heart that he wants to once again
[35:07] walk with you in the cool of the evening
[35:10] once again spend time with you once
[35:12] again put his arm around you
[35:14] and bring you into fellowship and
[35:18] because we my title is back to eden
[35:21] because in this world we live in a
[35:23] wasteland
[35:24] that people say try to to pretty up
[35:28] like putting makeup on a really ugly
[35:30] woman
[35:32] try to make her look nice but you can't
[35:34] hide it
[35:37] and so that's that's what's happening
[35:39] it's a wasteland around us
[35:40] we see glimpses of god's glory
[35:43] because he created it the other day i
[35:46] was driving through the around the
[35:47] parking lot waiting for kristen as she
[35:49] was in the store
[35:50] and uh they had they tried to do the
[35:53] landscaping or
[35:54] they do be landscaping around you know
[35:55] stores and kind of try to put things
[35:57] back so it's not just all concrete
[35:59] and i was looking at the trees and they
[36:02] were fluttering in the wind and it was
[36:03] it was it was this was a while a few
[36:05] weeks ago so spring was not quite honest
[36:07] but it was
[36:08] it was a taste of spring and summer to
[36:10] come and
[36:11] it just it was absolutely beautiful and
[36:14] i realized what a stark difference
[36:16] those that row of trees was to the
[36:18] pavement
[36:19] and the curb and the big shopping center
[36:22] and the cars and the weird people all
[36:25] around them
[36:27] and i thought wow we can try our best
[36:29] but we'll never
[36:30] ever replicate god's beauty
[36:33] and um your your sons and daughters of
[36:36] god are drawn to that because it's a
[36:38] glimpse
[36:39] into the heart of god amen we find his
[36:43] beauty
[36:43] in the scriptures and so and that draws
[36:47] us back to god
[36:48] back to eden
[36:51] and so praise the lord sin entered the
[36:54] human race
[36:55] and we were filthy
[36:58] this flesh still is it's fallen
[37:02] but we by god's grace keep it in control
[37:06] amen i can't imagine i like i don't know
[37:09] about you but i have a pretty vivid
[37:10] imagination
[37:11] and i i i put myself in these stories
[37:15] that i read and i'm not
[37:16] trying to say i'm special i'm just
[37:18] saying i
[37:20] imagine adam and eve put yourself
[37:23] where they are never having a headache
[37:25] never seeing
[37:26] never having a cut and blood never never
[37:29] having um
[37:30] an itch never never stubbing their toes
[37:33] never hurt not a single ounce of
[37:36] pain never having disappointment
[37:40] never never feeling disconnected from
[37:43] god
[37:45] and in a moment all of that
[37:48] changes they they had a relationship
[37:52] with the animals
[37:53] they had friendships with the animals
[37:55] think about how in your fallen flesh you
[37:57] how close you can get to like your dog
[37:59] or your cat but you really love them
[38:01] they might even love you back i don't
[38:02] know how that works but
[38:04] um here they are and now they stand and
[38:07] now they stand
[38:07] in their shame before god and he murders
[38:11] an animal in front of them for the first
[38:14] time they watch a life be
[38:15] taken can you imagine we see it every
[38:17] day we eat
[38:20] of we eat meat from animals that have
[38:22] been killed it's just part of our life
[38:24] but
[38:25] all of that happened to them in a single
[38:28] moment
[38:29] you went from paradise to
[38:33] chaos they they
[38:36] they started to hear as they left the
[38:39] garden of eden
[38:40] brother branham paints such a a
[38:42] heart-wrenching picture in your head
[38:44] but such a contrast to god's great grace
[38:46] and redemption
[38:47] when he talks about adam and eve walking
[38:49] from the garden he says eve
[38:51] crying on adam's shoulder the wet bloody
[38:54] skins of the animals flapping against
[38:56] their legs
[38:57] god watching them walk away breaking
[38:59] god's heart yet it was all part of god's
[39:02] eternal plan but you see the state
[39:05] of this love story that started off so
[39:08] well
[39:09] but then took a tragic tragic turn
[39:12] for the worse or so it would seem
[39:15] and so they go they they they spin
[39:18] somewhere for the night
[39:20] perhaps had to find shelter maybe that
[39:22] day
[39:24] was things slowly begin to change
[39:29] on the earth and in their bodies uh that
[39:32] night they begin to hear
[39:33] sounds they never heard before the
[39:35] howling of the packs of
[39:37] wolves as they took down an innocent
[39:39] lamb or
[39:40] took down a deer or a stag they begin to
[39:43] hear the noises you hear
[39:46] you're used to but here at the at the
[39:49] in in a single day 24 hours if you will
[39:52] if i can take liberty to say so
[39:54] they they go from perfect paradise
[39:57] unspoiled paradise
[39:58] now they begin to hear the sounds of
[40:01] death
[40:02] around them amen adam had his first
[40:06] headache
[40:07] they had their first argument the next
[40:09] morning over
[40:10] how he wanted his eggs
[40:15] they were amen they
[40:18] all the things that we experience every
[40:20] day suddenly
[40:21] rushing upon them imagine going
[40:24] i don't know how many of you have
[40:26] experienced that most of you probably
[40:27] have but
[40:28] i've had the opportunity uh to be in
[40:31] some very very
[40:32] remote places in the wilderness and
[40:34] you're there for a
[40:36] long period of time and when you come
[40:38] back my
[40:39] everything is so loud you hear every
[40:41] honk you hear every
[40:43] screeching tire you every baby in every
[40:46] house
[40:46] crying you hear people talking
[40:48] everywhere and just it rushes upon you
[40:50] and you're like
[40:51] you know you kind of get the blues for a
[40:52] little bit and you're like oh here
[40:54] welcome back
[40:54] right but that's just a glimpse to
[40:58] everything that came upon them that day
[41:01] when they made
[41:01] the wrong choice and it would seem as
[41:05] we look in from the outside on this
[41:07] great story unfolding before us
[41:10] that what is god going to do he lost
[41:13] his his his love the love of of his
[41:16] heart betrayed his word and
[41:20] he had to put them out from this place
[41:23] called
[41:24] the garden of eden but god
[41:27] whispered in adam's ear as he walked
[41:30] from the garden of eden
[41:31] don't worry son i will redeem you
[41:36] amen so what would become we look on and
[41:39] say well what will become of the people
[41:40] that god calls
[41:42] his children here they are out of the
[41:44] garden of eden
[41:46] amen but god had a plan
[41:49] you sit there you know it but imagine
[41:53] not knowing it not knowing what's going
[41:55] to happen
[41:56] but see adam it doesn't say it in the
[41:58] scriptures but you read between the
[41:59] lines
[42:00] adam had a revelation that someday
[42:03] someday god was going to fix the mistake
[42:07] that him and eve had made and then god
[42:10] was going to come back and as
[42:12] time progresses you see god called
[42:15] abraham
[42:16] out of the wilderness and begin to give
[42:18] him his promises
[42:20] and from abraham down through history
[42:23] god has been bringing those children of
[42:26] abraham
[42:27] back to him amen every
[42:31] everyone though they have passed on on
[42:33] their way
[42:34] back to eden amen we pick up the story
[42:38] in isaiah 51
[42:39] if you want to turn there you can um
[42:43] thus
[42:44] saith whoops 51 verse 1 hearken to me ye
[42:48] that follow after righteousness
[42:50] ye that seek the lord look unto the rock
[42:53] whence ye
[42:54] are hewn and to the whole of the pit
[42:57] once you are
[42:58] digged so you were cut from the rock
[43:03] you were cut from christ before the
[43:06] foundation of the world
[43:07] god said this one's my daughter
[43:11] right out of the rock what is the rock
[43:14] a revelation of who jesus christ is
[43:18] amen and so you were cut from that
[43:20] revelation
[43:21] in other words you cannot deny
[43:24] christ amen adam and eve
[43:28] lost it but god began to bring it
[43:31] back in place and he said don't worry
[43:34] you messed it up now
[43:36] but i already cut you from the rock
[43:39] and and the whole of the pit whence you
[43:42] were digged
[43:43] you say i'm so far down in
[43:47] in in this pit of sin how can anything
[43:50] help me but the scriptures here says
[43:52] he'll pull you right out of the pit
[43:55] amen he'll pull you amen right out of
[43:58] the pit
[43:59] that you have dug he says look unto
[44:02] abraham your father
[44:03] okay so he's talking about you we know
[44:06] that you're children of abraham
[44:08] and unto sarah that bear you for i
[44:10] called
[44:11] him alone and blessed him and increased
[44:14] him
[44:14] for the lord shall comfort zion
[44:17] he will comfort all her waste places
[44:20] and he will make her wilderness like
[44:23] eden
[44:25] and her desert like the garden of the
[44:27] lord
[44:29] joy and gladness shall be found therein
[44:31] thanksgiving and the voice of melody
[44:36] god's promise you daughters of zion
[44:41] he will make your wilderness like eden
[44:45] he will restore everything in your heart
[44:49] and soul
[44:50] amen back to the way it was before why
[44:53] so he can have fellowship with you he
[44:56] can't do it as long as you're
[44:58] a wilderness as long as zion is a
[45:02] wilderness there
[45:02] is no fellowship with christ he has to
[45:06] come and bring you
[45:07] back to eden we are facing eden are we
[45:11] there yet we will be when we go
[45:13] over to the other side and we rapture
[45:15] into eternity
[45:16] but we are standing in the wasteland
[45:19] that's called satan's
[45:20] eden but in our hearts
[45:24] there is unspoiled paradise
[45:28] you have an unspoiled communication
[45:31] an uninhibited fellowship with jesus
[45:35] christ
[45:36] amen who is the door got to stop there
[45:38] i'm going to get ahead of myself
[45:40] praise the lord revelation chapter 4
[45:42] 1961 brother brown
[45:44] had caught you there but the bible says
[45:46] you notice these cherubs that john
[45:48] saw here must have been interested in
[45:50] keeping the tree of life
[45:52] so they must have been they must be
[45:54] interested in human beings
[45:57] or read genesis getting back to genesis
[45:59] again
[46:01] they kept the tree of life guarded it
[46:04] the way of life
[46:05] the way of life how is the way jesus
[46:07] said i
[46:08] am that way i am that bread that come
[46:10] from god out of heaven
[46:12] if a man eats this bread he'll live
[46:14] forever now there is
[46:16] now there is a way back to that
[46:20] tree of life not a that
[46:24] tree of life you get it
[46:28] now at this so so the there was guards
[46:31] placed there
[46:33] but when christ died on the cross and
[46:36] the veil was rent
[46:37] into that holiest of holies
[46:41] if you will spiritually speaking the
[46:43] terror
[46:44] cherubs called off duty
[46:47] because now you have the ability to
[46:51] access the tree of life you can attain
[46:55] eternal life actually the guards
[46:59] still stand there but you have a pass
[47:03] amen now he says at this i want to
[47:07] to show to show now and make this sure
[47:09] it's an altar
[47:10] now this must have been an altar at the
[47:12] garden of eden i'll tell you why do you
[47:14] remember both cain and abel come up here
[47:16] to worship
[47:17] so that shows that god's altar was moved
[47:20] and set
[47:20] here at the garden of eden and the only
[47:22] way back to eden is
[47:24] by the altar here you are again see back
[47:27] to eden
[47:28] through the altar and they were to keep
[47:31] that way there
[47:32] guard it that they couldn't get back
[47:34] there until this
[47:35] altar was covered with blood so
[47:38] so okay i'll finish a quote oh god can't
[47:41] people see it see nothing but the blood
[47:43] there has to be an atonement a mercy
[47:45] seat there this altar of judgment
[47:48] must become a mercy seat how did
[47:51] the um which it was the east
[47:54] of the east side of the garden by the
[47:56] way which east is the line of the tribe
[47:57] of judah
[47:58] how did this way the only way for them
[48:01] to have
[48:02] access back was by spilt
[48:05] blood on the altar what does that blood
[48:07] on the altar do it turns
[48:09] judgment into grace it turns judgment
[48:12] into mercy
[48:13] into the mercy seat as long as that
[48:15] blood is there
[48:16] amen god is giving out mercy and so he
[48:20] says and when this altar if the blood is
[48:22] lifted there will send on that judgment
[48:24] day the fire of god's wrath to guard
[48:27] that tree again
[48:28] only one thing will enter into this gate
[48:31] to eden again will be through the blood
[48:32] of jesus christ so i
[48:34] re i going back in time the cherubs
[48:38] are off duty everybody has access to the
[48:41] tree of life but one of these days when
[48:43] the blood is lifted
[48:44] amen they're going to stand guard again
[48:47] amen
[48:48] to that tree of life so anybody can come
[48:50] but not everybody is going to find the
[48:52] the entrance to the garden of eden
[48:54] because jesus christ is the door
[48:56] he is the way amen he is life and
[48:59] there's only going to be those that
[49:01] remember eden
[49:04] uh that was thousands of years ago
[49:08] chris i was born 20
[49:11] 40 40 years ago
[49:14] how do i remember eden the spiritual
[49:18] version of you
[49:20] you the seed of god in your heart
[49:22] remembers
[49:23] eden that's why when you met christ
[49:27] he was so familiar because there was
[49:30] something that connected it was what you
[49:33] were
[49:33] always looking for abraham walked
[49:37] and walked and walked and walked and his
[49:40] faith on his journey was testified to
[49:44] his righteousness
[49:45] but you found it the children of abraham
[49:49] have
[49:49] found the door to the garden of eden
[49:52] they have found the door which is christ
[49:54] why because
[49:55] now you can find him when abraham walked
[49:59] the plains of memory there was no
[50:01] access to that fellowship yet there was
[50:04] only
[50:05] a type of that access
[50:08] and then abraham was able to see
[50:11] melchizedek and speak to god because god
[50:14] led him
[50:15] but there was no holy ghost even amen
[50:19] so the altar is the only way back to
[50:22] eden
[50:22] the tabernacle in the wilderness was
[50:24] just a foretaste
[50:27] of what god had in mind it was it was
[50:30] god's
[50:32] god said okay this is going to be
[50:35] an example
[50:38] the time is not right yet but this is an
[50:41] example
[50:42] pointing them to the truth but
[50:46] you see it was the truth and it was
[50:49] their access but it was
[50:50] it wasn't it wasn't the real thing
[50:55] it was it was it was a an expression of
[50:58] worship
[50:59] but it wasn't the real thing they didn't
[51:01] have access to christ like you do
[51:04] amen if if you allow me it was it was
[51:07] like a mirage
[51:08] out in the desert you see it
[51:11] and wow look at that can almost see what
[51:14] that
[51:14] is right but you never quite get to it
[51:19] they were they were trying to get to it
[51:21] they were trying to
[51:22] but they couldn't get to it they're only
[51:24] the priest high priest could go in once
[51:26] a year
[51:26] but then when god came
[51:29] amen and he turned your wilderness
[51:33] into eden you arrived
[51:37] at that place amen that it was no longer
[51:41] a mirage to you
[51:43] and then it was no longer obscure and
[51:45] something you were looking for i'm not
[51:46] exactly sure
[51:47] what i want you know mirage you're not
[51:49] exactly sure what you're seeing it
[51:51] maybe water maybe trees you know it's
[51:53] real blurry
[51:55] and um but it turned out this time
[51:58] around
[52:00] the mirage turned into reality for you
[52:03] there are people chasing mirages in the
[52:06] wilderness called satan's eden
[52:08] and they come to them and they vanish oh
[52:12] this
[52:12] this new job will give me all i want and
[52:15] they go and they get to that and it's
[52:16] just a mirage of peace
[52:19] it vanishes before their eyes but they
[52:22] see
[52:22] you and you're you're traveling forward
[52:25] you see the real thing and the
[52:26] fake thing both look the same in the
[52:28] distance
[52:30] in the desert the heat waves a mirage
[52:34] is something i think that's not there
[52:36] but it can look like a mirage
[52:38] and be real so the world says i don't
[52:41] know why you're going after that it's
[52:43] fake
[52:43] it looks just like this and this one
[52:46] over here that i went to and it
[52:47] disappeared in vanessa i couldn't find
[52:49] peace
[52:50] why are you going towards it but you
[52:52] have a revelation in your heart
[52:54] amen that you're on your way back to
[52:56] eden
[52:57] so you're looking in the distance amen
[53:00] praise the lord
[53:01] excuse me i heard that so they were
[53:04] looking
[53:05] towards this this tabernacle in the
[53:07] wilderness
[53:08] and they're asking themselves is that
[53:10] eden i see
[53:11] do i see the truth in there amen it was
[53:14] a it was a teaser it was a it was a
[53:16] preview
[53:17] and then but down through history it was
[53:19] preached and prophesied
[53:20] there would be a return to eden amen but
[53:24] how and will then come along the
[53:26] prophecy of a virgin
[53:28] shall conceive amen john asked the same
[53:31] question
[53:32] who is worthy who is worthy to take us
[53:35] back
[53:35] those guards are standing there with
[53:37] their swords ready they're flaming
[53:39] swords
[53:40] adam and eve lost it who
[53:43] can fix it who can bring us back to eden
[53:47] who can restore the fellowship there's
[53:49] nobody worthy
[53:52] who can do it and then weep not job
[53:54] before
[53:55] behold the lion of the tribe of judah
[53:57] shall prevail so he got his answer in
[54:00] christ
[54:01] he saw that christ was the answer
[54:06] to the eden dilemma
[54:12] this great love story with such a
[54:14] heartbreaking beginning
[54:19] amen praise the lord with such a
[54:21] heartbreaking beginning
[54:23] is has seen
[54:27] a shift in the story kind of like a good
[54:31] a good book you know like a good book
[54:32] that you cannot figure it out
[54:34] you try i've read a lot of books
[54:37] so i'm pretty good at figuring out the
[54:39] plot
[54:40] and when i find a book that's too
[54:42] challenging to figure out
[54:44] and just you just you love it right get
[54:46] down to the very end and
[54:48] and oh wow it's going to work out so
[54:50] here's john reading the book
[54:53] and he said i don't know how it's going
[54:54] to work it's impossible i
[54:57] i can't see i can't see how the the the
[55:00] this love story
[55:01] there's there's gonna be a redemption
[55:04] of this of this relationship this love
[55:08] that was lost
[55:09] how is god going to get his bride back
[55:11] how is he going to bring a bride to him
[55:13] how are we going to ever have a promise
[55:17] outside of this
[55:18] death but there was a plot twist
[55:22] see the lion became the lamb and the
[55:25] lamb was given for a sacrifice
[55:27] nobody saw that one coming and so
[55:31] christ rescued his bride now
[55:34] god has fellowship again amen and is
[55:38] taking
[55:38] us back to eden brother madam says in
[55:42] redeemer
[55:43] redemption 1955 what did he redeem he
[55:47] redeemed your soul from hell
[55:49] he redeemed and brought back everything
[55:51] that adam lost
[55:53] when he put you in the pawn shop
[55:56] jesus christ on calvary was your kinsman
[56:00] redeemer
[56:01] that redeemed you from every curse of
[56:03] the devil
[56:04] he redeems your soul he redeems your
[56:06] sick
[56:07] body he redeems your weary dreary spirit
[56:12] he brought you happiness he brought you
[56:15] joy he brought you that's what the
[56:17] redemption brought you
[56:19] brought you peace long-suffering
[56:21] goodness gentleness meekness
[56:23] power the holy spirit brought you divine
[56:26] healing all these things jesus christ
[56:30] brought to you
[56:32] because excuse me he was our kinsmen
[56:35] redeemer amen isaiah chapter four
[56:48] i went to this scripture not
[56:51] not knowing that um it was the the
[56:54] scripture that they all sing about
[56:56] on sunday but i found and i said oh look
[56:58] at there
[57:00] so isaiah chapter 4 and in that day
[57:02] seven women shall take hold of one man
[57:04] saying we will eat our own bread and
[57:05] wear our own apparel
[57:06] only let us be called by thy name to
[57:08] take away our reproach
[57:10] and that day shall the branch of the
[57:12] lord be beautiful and glorious
[57:14] see i'm trying to paint the picture adam
[57:16] and eve amen walked out of the garden of
[57:19] eden and all of this
[57:20] and and now that this filth enters the
[57:22] human race and you you look at this
[57:24] picture in this spoiled
[57:26] ride amen this this this bra whose
[57:28] garments are tattered and spoiled
[57:30] and you think how can god find a bride
[57:33] in that
[57:34] but the scripture here says when those
[57:36] that aren't called of god will begin to
[57:38] say we just want his name
[57:40] that god's going to say i am going to
[57:42] bring from
[57:43] zion i'm going to turn her wilderness
[57:46] into eden
[57:47] i'm going to bring that woman and clothe
[57:50] her in a spotless
[57:52] white garment and so the world won't
[57:54] recognize
[57:55] who she is because they only know her by
[57:58] what she was
[57:59] but i saw from the beginning of time
[58:02] that down in her heart
[58:03] and when she was spotless she was cut
[58:06] from the rock and i was going to bring
[58:09] her from the pit so you have
[58:10] this two versions versions
[58:15] one this woman who is covered in filth
[58:18] and just wants the name the daughters of
[58:20] babylon but then on this side you have
[58:22] the daughters
[58:23] of zion and he says in that day shall
[58:25] the branch of the lord be
[58:27] beautiful and glorious what day this day
[58:30] and the fruit of the earth shall be
[58:32] excellent and comely for them
[58:34] that are escaped of israel it shall come
[58:36] to pass that he that is left in zion and
[58:38] he that remaineth in jerusalem shall be
[58:40] called holy
[58:42] everyone that is written among the
[58:44] living in jerusalem
[58:45] you mean the children of the man and the
[58:47] woman that betrayed
[58:48] god's trust in the garden of eden could
[58:50] be holy
[58:52] you mean that children of those parents
[58:55] that committed fornication in
[58:57] in the garden of eden in god's great
[58:59] holy place
[59:00] could bring forth somebody worthy of
[59:03] marrying jesus christ
[59:05] yes because god said i have a plan
[59:09] of redemption when the lord shall have
[59:12] washed
[59:13] away the filth of the daughters of zion
[59:17] so the daughters of zion were filthy
[59:21] but god washed them white as
[59:24] snow amen and shall have purged
[59:28] the blood of jerusalem from the midst
[59:30] thereof by the spirit
[59:32] of judgment and by the spirit of burning
[59:35] i am you were called
[59:38] justified redeemed and cleansed by the
[59:41] holy ghost and fire
[59:44] god stood and judged you called but
[59:47] there's a quote you can find it but then
[59:49] talks about the scripture and the lord
[59:50] will create upon every dwelling place of
[59:53] mount zion and upon her assemblies a
[59:55] cloud and smoke by day
[59:56] and the shining of a flaming fire by
[59:58] night for upon all the glory shall be a
[1:00:01] defense
[1:00:01] and there shall be a tabernacle for a
[1:00:03] shadow in the daytime from the heat
[1:00:05] and for a place of refuge and for a
[1:00:08] covert
[1:00:09] from storm and from rain the only way
[1:00:13] back to eden is under the headship of
[1:00:16] christ
[1:00:17] amen god took you the daughter of zion
[1:00:21] and washed the filth from you and he
[1:00:23] brought you to a place where you
[1:00:25] stand called holy called mrs
[1:00:28] jesus christ amen god is bringing you
[1:00:31] back to eden and
[1:00:35] but the only way and this is where this
[1:00:37] is what just gets me stirred up because
[1:00:39] you can't you can't
[1:00:42] deny who you are
[1:00:46] you you there is even these people that
[1:00:49] do
[1:00:49] weird things with their bodies they're
[1:00:51] still what they were born
[1:00:54] you can't deny it you can't change what
[1:00:56] you are
[1:00:57] the same way as a believer you can't
[1:01:00] change the fact that you're a part of
[1:01:02] the bride of christ
[1:01:04] you can you wouldn't but you could try
[1:01:06] as hard as you could to
[1:01:07] to change it i don't want to be it i
[1:01:09] don't and you you fought it
[1:01:12] you fought it till you found no peace in
[1:01:14] satan's eden
[1:01:15] in the spoiled paradise of the world you
[1:01:18] didn't find it
[1:01:19] amen but here it is brother mohammed
[1:01:22] says in
[1:01:22] in christ is the mystery of god revealed
[1:01:25] 1963
[1:01:27] the word produces its own life
[1:01:30] that eve swapped for personal knowledge
[1:01:33] now
[1:01:34] yes i cut and spliced but i didn't cut
[1:01:37] and splice if you know what i'm saying
[1:01:39] there's just a couple paragraphs where
[1:01:40] those dots are that we didn't need to
[1:01:42] read
[1:01:42] then he says a little bit further he
[1:01:44] says he the head is the first fruits of
[1:01:46] the resurrection
[1:01:47] and then in paragraph 5 16 then the
[1:01:49] bride body must
[1:01:51] follow the head for it is part of his
[1:01:54] resurrection
[1:01:55] part of the mystery your part of the
[1:01:58] mystery
[1:01:59] why is it a mystery how
[1:02:03] could he take filthy daughter
[1:02:06] of zion a filthy woman and make her the
[1:02:10] daughter zion
[1:02:12] how could he take mary
[1:02:16] magdalene and turn her life around
[1:02:20] till people see her and say she's a holy
[1:02:22] woman
[1:02:24] how can god take that fallen bride from
[1:02:26] the garden of eden
[1:02:28] and restore her back amen
[1:02:31] that is the mystery that is the paradox
[1:02:34] he says it's impossible for it not to go
[1:02:38] see you can't you can't you can't stop
[1:02:40] it
[1:02:41] you're on the train and the train ain't
[1:02:43] stopping
[1:02:45] amen so he says it's part of god's
[1:02:48] mystery how
[1:02:48] god revealed himself here and raised it
[1:02:51] up by the word so he reveals his
[1:02:55] church and raising it up by the same
[1:02:58] word
[1:02:59] it's a part of his threefold mystery as
[1:03:02] the head was took
[1:03:03] from the grave so must the body follow
[1:03:06] him
[1:03:07] back to eden
[1:03:11] praise the lord maybe this will sink in
[1:03:13] tomorrow
[1:03:14] and then you'll smile and laugh as the
[1:03:16] head was taken from the grave
[1:03:18] so must the body follow him back to eden
[1:03:21] where
[1:03:21] the head of the family the man the
[1:03:24] bridegroom
[1:03:25] the bride being the body of the
[1:03:27] bridegroom
[1:03:28] must follow not she might follow maybe
[1:03:31] she'll follow
[1:03:33] i don't know eve she didn't follow and
[1:03:36] and
[1:03:36] and now the second adam we're gonna try
[1:03:38] this again
[1:03:40] the second eve we're gonna try this
[1:03:41] again okay we'll try this all again but
[1:03:43] guess what
[1:03:45] there's a secret ingredient there's a
[1:03:47] mystery
[1:03:48] and the devil wishes he can figure it
[1:03:51] out but he can't
[1:03:52] and we can't even explain it but it's
[1:03:54] the mystery that
[1:03:55] you are the elect of god there is
[1:03:58] something
[1:03:59] in you something in you that marks you
[1:04:02] as one of his own and nothing can take
[1:04:05] and it's
[1:04:05] it ain't no mirage
[1:04:10] amen the bride because that's the head
[1:04:12] the head is revealed
[1:04:15] how could you follow the head unless it
[1:04:16] was revealed has to be revealed
[1:04:19] christ has to be revealed you have to
[1:04:21] know everything he is
[1:04:22] you have to have the ability to know
[1:04:24] everything he is if you want to follow
[1:04:26] him back to eden
[1:04:27] if you're following a god that's not
[1:04:30] revealed
[1:04:31] you're wandering in the desert like
[1:04:32] everybody else but christ has revealed
[1:04:35] himself
[1:04:36] in order for us to find our way
[1:04:39] back to eden and then we can't do it
[1:04:42] without christ revealed because
[1:04:44] he is our head if your head's not
[1:04:47] revealed how are you going to
[1:04:49] find your way you can't do it
[1:04:53] that's why you don't understand it but
[1:04:55] people can't understand it
[1:04:58] god had to show himself and if he hadn't
[1:05:01] showed himself by now
[1:05:03] the bible would be false because how are
[1:05:06] you going to get back to where you're
[1:05:08] supposed to be
[1:05:09] how are you going to become who you are
[1:05:11] meant to be unless
[1:05:13] he shows himself to you and that is
[1:05:15] happening the world around you testifies
[1:05:17] that it's the time
[1:05:18] for christ to be revealed amen that has
[1:05:21] to line up
[1:05:22] praise the lord so he says um
[1:05:27] the head is revealed and come back with
[1:05:29] eternal life and the body must follow
[1:05:31] that because it is husband and wife
[1:05:33] again
[1:05:34] what yes you're married to christ
[1:05:38] you are married
[1:05:44] amen and as long as you're pregnant with
[1:05:46] the same word which is his body
[1:05:49] you took his body become in him when you
[1:05:52] took the word
[1:05:54] not the creed the word and he says i
[1:05:57] hear the word produces its own
[1:05:59] life see eve swapped th
[1:06:02] swapped the word for personal knowledge
[1:06:06] but the bride that's married to the
[1:06:08] second adam
[1:06:09] is not going to swap it she can't swap
[1:06:12] it because she has received
[1:06:14] the word the word got to her
[1:06:17] before the devil could and sealed her up
[1:06:21] sealed up that wound of her soul and now
[1:06:24] what what's happening the flesh your
[1:06:27] flesh tries to deny it are you even a
[1:06:29] christian man bro
[1:06:32] what are you doing you're not even saved
[1:06:35] right your flesh denies it
[1:06:38] but the word inside of you is producing
[1:06:41] its own
[1:06:42] life it says never mind about you
[1:06:45] i'm growing i'm pushing
[1:06:49] it's pushing back the dark
[1:06:52] amen the love story has been completed
[1:06:55] because you're married to christ you
[1:06:58] know um
[1:07:00] just uh telling my wife a little that
[1:07:02] when i first met her i was like this
[1:07:04] girl
[1:07:05] is is is all right um
[1:07:09] and i i well i was too scared to pursue
[1:07:12] it she had to
[1:07:13] message me on facebook and then i
[1:07:15] pursued it
[1:07:17] and um you know we're talking and i'm on
[1:07:19] cloud nine man i'm wow
[1:07:21] man this girl is awesome like finally
[1:07:23] found me a good one
[1:07:25] and she goes hey by the way i just want
[1:07:27] to be friends and just
[1:07:28] pop my balloon just
[1:07:32] and i was deflated and uh
[1:07:36] but my dad said don't worry my
[1:07:39] your mom said the same thing to me
[1:07:43] and so a few months later she changed
[1:07:45] her mind
[1:07:46] but it kind of i forgot i lost my train
[1:07:50] of thought when i said all that
[1:07:52] so god started out with his bride but
[1:07:55] she said never mind
[1:07:57] i'm not interested and took the seed of
[1:08:00] the serpent
[1:08:02] but god
[1:08:05] you know what i apologize somebody can
[1:08:07] go back and find my thought
[1:08:09] there in the archives and they can maybe
[1:08:12] figure it out for themselves i'm just
[1:08:13] going to move forward because i do not
[1:08:14] remember what i was talking about
[1:08:16] so anyways oh that's what i was the love
[1:08:19] story has been completed
[1:08:23] so amen praise the lord so the love
[1:08:26] story
[1:08:26] had a bad beginning oh it didn't seem
[1:08:29] like it was going to work out
[1:08:32] but i can stand here and say it's been
[1:08:33] completed because now you're married to
[1:08:35] christ
[1:08:37] amen praise the lord leave it there so
[1:08:41] we are facing eden i had notes to this
[1:08:45] sermon before brother preach brother
[1:08:46] david preached on sunday
[1:08:48] and he started talking about facing eden
[1:08:50] and i just met i don't know this is all
[1:08:51] just going together somehow
[1:08:53] amen it's no mirage on the horizon for
[1:08:56] us
[1:08:56] we see it you know they those without a
[1:08:59] revelation they look on and they go
[1:09:02] ah what are you seeing i can't see it
[1:09:05] it's just
[1:09:06] it's you know it looks like maybe the
[1:09:08] seals are open but i just can't
[1:09:10] understand it
[1:09:11] i don't know i just should we just
[1:09:13] listen to tapes i can't tell
[1:09:15] but you have been given the eyes to see
[1:09:18] and what is a mirage to everyone else is
[1:09:21] crystal clear to you and you know
[1:09:23] that that is eden amen behind us and
[1:09:28] around us
[1:09:29] is a wasteland the desert of satan's
[1:09:31] eden
[1:09:32] the world looks on trying to reach eden
[1:09:34] but for them it is only a mirage that
[1:09:36] vanishes
[1:09:37] when their ideas for peace crumble they
[1:09:40] try it
[1:09:42] imagine world peace right they've been
[1:09:45] trying for it
[1:09:46] you know free love
[1:09:49] the just just gone downhill from there
[1:09:52] trying to find peace why can't we just
[1:09:54] all get along let's create
[1:09:55] you know the um the u.n let's let's just
[1:09:58] have peace all the world over it can't
[1:10:00] happen
[1:10:01] it cannot happen um so to
[1:10:05] okay to turn from following after christ
[1:10:08] is to deny his headship i didn't i
[1:10:11] didn't get the pictures
[1:10:12] and now i wish i would have but i was
[1:10:13] gonna have a picture of the desert
[1:10:15] and of beautiful scenery problem is i
[1:10:18] was worried because what i think is
[1:10:19] beautiful scenery might not be the same
[1:10:20] for everyone else but
[1:10:22] if you had a gorgeous mountain
[1:10:26] scene like something up in the sawtooths
[1:10:28] right big beautiful blue lake
[1:10:30] green trees around and you had the
[1:10:33] sahara desert sand only
[1:10:36] which would you rather pursue
[1:10:39] the desert or the mountain
[1:10:42] or the beautiful scenery with water
[1:10:46] any any normal person would say
[1:10:49] the mountain scene so why
[1:10:53] why do you want to turn and say oh i
[1:10:56] can't follow after that and
[1:10:58] walk back into the wasteland
[1:11:01] just like the children of israel they
[1:11:03] said all the leaks and the garlics of
[1:11:04] egypt
[1:11:06] and someone's like um you mean the whips
[1:11:08] and the scorching of egypt
[1:11:11] how soon they forget when things don't
[1:11:13] go their way they had been spoiled if
[1:11:15] you will
[1:11:17] and they didn't like it now it's boring
[1:11:19] guess what
[1:11:20] i'm here to tell you sometimes serving
[1:11:22] god can be
[1:11:24] well i don't want to be i don't want to
[1:11:25] say this wrong the life of a christian
[1:11:28] can sometimes be boring that's how the
[1:11:31] devil gets you
[1:11:33] nothing's happening things are just you
[1:11:35] know you know their people are here
[1:11:37] they're doing you know he can kind of
[1:11:38] get you to think
[1:11:41] i don't know what i'm trying to say you
[1:11:42] just gotta fill in the blanks there but
[1:11:44] anyways
[1:11:45] there it was it was same old same hole
[1:11:49] sunday morning that's on friday sunday
[1:11:50] morning church
[1:11:52] but jason's singing that song again
[1:11:56] i said wednesday night brother chris is
[1:11:59] slobbering again
[1:12:01] right i'm just doing this thing like i'm
[1:12:03] here i'm at church
[1:12:04] right and you're converted but see you
[1:12:08] have just this
[1:12:09] it's a rhythm a pattern gets stuck in a
[1:12:11] rut it's called
[1:12:13] and you think to yourself you know if i
[1:12:14] could just hop the fence
[1:12:16] my goodness i would have a blast in that
[1:12:18] grass over there
[1:12:19] now you just hop the fence but then the
[1:12:23] shepherd comes along and breaks your leg
[1:12:25] so then you have to stand and buy and
[1:12:28] hang out with the shepherd
[1:12:29] but um as of having the children
[1:12:32] invisible they got complacent
[1:12:33] with the miracles happening all around
[1:12:35] them we say
[1:12:36] people some people say you know where
[1:12:39] where's the
[1:12:40] great you know the great healings and
[1:12:43] the miracles of brother brandon if we
[1:12:44] could go back to the days of brother
[1:12:45] branham

[1:12:51] god is is on the move if you don't see
[1:12:55] it you ain't looking in the right place
[1:12:58] amen the world looks on praise lord okay
[1:13:00] i got
[1:13:01] behind in my notes to turn back
[1:13:04] into the desert from following christ
[1:13:07] they entered back into
[1:13:08] the wasteland but in deuteronomy 32
[1:13:16] and i'm closing here shortly deuteronomy
[1:13:18] chapter 32

[1:13:24] book to find
[1:13:26] deuteronomy chapter 32 verse 7. don't
[1:13:32] have to follow what you can
[1:13:35] remember the days of old consider the
[1:13:37] years of many generations and ask thy
[1:13:39] father and he will show thee thy elders
[1:13:41] and they will tell thee
[1:13:43] in other words ask for the testimonies
[1:13:45] of the time gone by
[1:13:47] and when the most high when the most
[1:13:48] high divided to the nations their
[1:13:50] inheritance when he separated the sons
[1:13:52] of adam
[1:13:52] he set the bounds of the people
[1:13:54] according to the number of the children
[1:13:55] of israel
[1:13:56] for the lord's portion is his people
[1:13:58] jacob is the lot of his inheritance
[1:14:02] you are the lord's inheritance
[1:14:05] amen he found him
[1:14:08] in a desert land amen he found you in a
[1:14:12] desert land
[1:14:14] in the waste howling wilderness he led
[1:14:18] him about he
[1:14:18] instructed him he kept him as the apple
[1:14:21] of his
[1:14:22] eye as an eagle stir up her nest
[1:14:25] fluttereth over her young spreadeth
[1:14:27] abroad her wings
[1:14:29] taketh them beareth them on her wings so
[1:14:31] the lord
[1:14:32] alone did lead him and there was no
[1:14:35] strange
[1:14:35] god with him in other words he had
[1:14:38] revelation that
[1:14:39] his god was the only god for him
[1:14:44] he had a revelation this is the one that
[1:14:47] pulled me from the wilderness
[1:14:49] from the howling wasteland
[1:14:54] and as an ego stir with her nest as she
[1:14:57] puts out her wings with her brother man
[1:14:59] tell the story and you can go listen to
[1:15:00] that sermon
[1:15:02] as eagles stir with her nest she put out
[1:15:03] her wings
[1:15:05] and brought them little eaglets up into
[1:15:08] the sky he brings you up into the
[1:15:10] heavenly places and then he
[1:15:12] pops you off to learn how to fly
[1:15:15] and you're falling and you're falling
[1:15:17] and you're thinking god has forsaken me
[1:15:18] and then he catches you and bears you up
[1:15:20] on his wings again
[1:15:22] and then god teaching you amen how to
[1:15:25] fly how to
[1:15:26] make it through this wilderness called
[1:15:28] satan's eden
[1:15:29] into the place of of of true
[1:15:33] unspoiled paradise amen
[1:15:36] the children of abraham he leads from
[1:15:39] the wasteland god is guiding you
[1:15:42] and leading you back to eden you say i i
[1:15:46] you know you want to find that that
[1:15:49] peace the world is looking for that
[1:15:51] peace and they'll never
[1:15:52] find it in the wilderness but
[1:15:56] god can lead them like god has led you
[1:15:59] to a place where they recognize amen
[1:16:02] that he
[1:16:02] is their peace he is their portion so
[1:16:05] while we are
[1:16:06] here on earth in this dreadful satan's
[1:16:09] eden
[1:16:10] amen there is an eden within us
[1:16:13] that we have can tap have tapped into
[1:16:17] and when there's chaos all around we can
[1:16:19] find you know there's oasises
[1:16:22] oh he says i don't say that right in the
[1:16:24] desert
[1:16:25] places of comfort and peace and that's
[1:16:28] what god
[1:16:29] gives you amen praise the lord
[1:16:32] and everything he has promised in his
[1:16:35] book
[1:16:36] is yours for the taking amen the
[1:16:38] musicians want to come tonight
[1:16:40] jesus christ has restored all that was
[1:16:43] lost
[1:16:43] in the garden of eden amen we're on our
[1:16:46] way back to dwell there for eternity but
[1:16:48] the bantam says
[1:16:49] that christ restored all christ was
[1:16:53] all that adam lost
[1:16:57] and that's a sermon in itself
[1:17:00] christ was all that adam lost in other
[1:17:03] words
[1:17:06] peace redemption
[1:17:10] eternal life
[1:17:14] healing all of that was
[1:17:18] lost but when christ came see
[1:17:22] you don't need anything else besides
[1:17:24] christ
[1:17:27] when that's why when christ has been
[1:17:28] revealed to you
[1:17:30] eliezer steps off the scene you need
[1:17:34] christ
[1:17:35] if i was going to say hey listen you
[1:17:37] need to talk to this guy
[1:17:40] joe over here he knows a lot about
[1:17:44] gold panning and i brought you to joe
[1:17:48] and then i sit in between you guys and
[1:17:49] start to tell you what i know about
[1:17:52] gold panning what what would be the you
[1:17:55] excuse me i'm trying to talk to joe
[1:18:01] if what i'm trying to say is if i
[1:18:02] brought you to joan then you talk to me
[1:18:04] and not joe what will be the point of
[1:18:05] that introduction
[1:18:07] what will be the point but we have been
[1:18:09] introduced to christ
[1:18:10] amen but to
[1:18:13] [Music]
[1:18:15] but to submit to god's word
[1:18:19] takes full surrender
[1:18:22] and when you find people that that that
[1:18:24] that
[1:18:25] can't follow the way that god has set in
[1:18:28] order it's because they have a problem
[1:18:31] coming
[1:18:31] underneath total headship because
[1:18:35] you can follow the tapes of brother
[1:18:37] branham
[1:18:38] and live in your life
[1:18:41] and chip of christ because the headship
[1:18:43] of christ says
[1:18:45] the fivefold ministry so you can't
[1:18:48] get back to eden without being under the
[1:18:51] headship of christ you
[1:18:54] have to follow and you can't get back to
[1:18:56] eden but underneath the edge of christ
[1:18:58] maybe you even believe in preachers but
[1:19:00] you don't accept god's revealed word for
[1:19:02] your
[1:19:02] for today you cannot
[1:19:06] come underneath his headship
[1:19:09] it's impossible because you don't know
[1:19:11] who the head is unless he's revealed to
[1:19:13] you
[1:19:14] amen as the believer as a son of god
[1:19:17] believing
[1:19:17] all of this coming to a good church
[1:19:19] listening to good preachers
[1:19:21] you will never find victory in your life
[1:19:23] until
[1:19:24] you can surrender and come underneath
[1:19:26] his headship
[1:19:28] so that he can take you back to eden
[1:19:31] amen the things that you're struggling
[1:19:33] with until you completely surrender
[1:19:35] and lay it all on what the altar which
[1:19:38] is the way into the garden of eden
[1:19:40] that blood of jesus christ comes and
[1:19:42] covers those things until you lay it
[1:19:44] down
[1:19:45] it doesn't have to be sin it doesn't
[1:19:46] have to be an addiction to something
[1:19:49] or cigarettes or smoking or drinking it
[1:19:51] can simply be a burden that you're
[1:19:53] carrying
[1:19:54] you can be it can be a lie that you're
[1:19:56] accepting from the devil
[1:19:57] god is asking you to just set it down
[1:20:00] and he'll cover it with the blood amen
[1:20:02] and allow you to
[1:20:04] step in to eden amen
[1:20:07] into the peace that he is offering
[1:20:10] you amen in this great love story saints
[1:20:14] of god
[1:20:16] we hear enough negativity in the world
[1:20:19] around us
[1:20:21] god doesn't need to point his finger
[1:20:23] down at you and say how dare you
[1:20:26] instead he says better than this
[1:20:29] you're better than this saints of god
[1:20:32] i'm here to tell you tonight you're
[1:20:33] better than this
[1:20:35] whatever it is you're facing you're
[1:20:37] better than it it could be a
[1:20:38] just a a problem you're trying to solve
[1:20:40] at the job you can't figure it out
[1:20:43] just pray look i'm not a smart
[1:20:47] i'm not a you know people oh you're a
[1:20:48] programmer you must be some kind of
[1:20:50] brain no no i just pray
[1:20:51] lord i can't figure this out and he
[1:20:53] gives me the answer
[1:20:53] [Music]
[1:20:56] god what god has been trying to say
[1:21:01] in these in these we've kind of talked
[1:21:03] about it in fellowship a little bit how
[1:21:05] the
[1:21:05] the services are lining up so
[1:21:07] beautifully picking up the next
[1:21:08] verse and and brother david said it on
[1:21:11] sunday the lord is trying to tell you
[1:21:13] something
[1:21:14] and i believe what god is trying to say
[1:21:16] is
[1:21:17] little bride come underneath my headship
[1:21:20] a little bit more because i just want to
[1:21:21] wrap my
[1:21:22] arms around you i just want to hold you
[1:21:25] close
[1:21:26] just come here just just lay on the
[1:21:28] altar of of your heart let everything go
[1:21:31] because
[1:21:31] not because he you don't do that of fear
[1:21:34] you do it because you love him not
[1:21:36] because
[1:21:36] you're trying to keep him happy but
[1:21:38] because he longs
[1:21:40] he's a longing his arms are aching to
[1:21:42] wrap them around you and hold you close
[1:21:45] but there's something holding you back
[1:21:47] there's something keeping you some
[1:21:49] unforgiveness in your heart
[1:21:51] that's keeping you from from from god
[1:21:53] being able to wrap you up because that's
[1:21:55] what he wants to do
[1:21:56] so bad he's not standing there telling
[1:21:58] you would you just
[1:21:59] get get things straight come on knock it
[1:22:02] off no he's saying please come
[1:22:04] please i want to hold you close that's
[1:22:06] what god is trying to say but you can't
[1:22:08] do it
[1:22:08] outside of his headship you have to be
[1:22:11] underneath the headship and then god
[1:22:14] will bring you
[1:22:16] and hold you and take you back
[1:22:19] amen let's bow our heads heavenly father
[1:22:22] lord jesus we're so thankful father that
[1:22:25] we
[1:22:25] serve you father there are many gods
[1:22:28] there are many religions
[1:22:30] there are many things we could put our
[1:22:32] time and energy into
[1:22:34] but none of them bring life father the
[1:22:37] satan's eden that we are
[1:22:39] walking through shedding your light
[1:22:41] father is a world of darkness
[1:22:43] a world of howling a waste
[1:22:47] a howling wilderness but god you have
[1:22:49] given us the ability
[1:22:51] to stand above what the devil has thrown
[1:22:53] at us father i pray for your children
[1:22:55] tonight lord that are having a hard time
[1:22:57] letting go
[1:22:58] lord may you give them the strength but
[1:23:00] you give them the ability father to let
[1:23:02] it go
[1:23:03] to lay it down father for that is not
[1:23:05] who we are we are better than that
[1:23:07] not in an arrogant spirit but in a
[1:23:09] confidence that you have called this
[1:23:11] i've read the scriptures father
[1:23:13] i've we've gone through them the quotes
[1:23:15] that they are a daughter of zion who
[1:23:17] once
[1:23:18] at one time was filthy but has been
[1:23:20] washed by the blood of christ
[1:23:22] who at one time was denied
[1:23:25] christ as their husband but now have
[1:23:27] become a bride
[1:23:29] mrs jesus christ that's who they are
[1:23:32] they're not who their parents say they
[1:23:34] are they're not who their complexes say
[1:23:36] they are
[1:23:37] and they're not who the devil whispers
[1:23:38] in the ear their ear that they are
[1:23:41] they are queens and kings of the kingdom
[1:23:45] of jesus christ father and we are on our
[1:23:48] way

[1:24:13] our identity in some man may we not try
[1:24:16] to find our identity in some woman
