[33:29] sister Diane God bless you welcome home
[33:32] amen if you want to stand with me
[33:33] tonight we're going to take part three
[33:37] of the breach
[33:40] revealed and
[33:42] um have a couple of scriptures here
[33:45] Matthew chapter
[33:49] 25 um but my subtitle or the subject of
[33:54] this part is the mystery in The Virgins
[33:58] um and we'll read these scriptures here
[34:00] and then we'll do a bit of a a
[34:02] review um before we get into this so
[34:07] Matthew CH
[34:11] 25:1 then shall the Kingdom of Heaven be
[34:13] liken unto 10 virgins which took their
[34:15] lamps and went forth to meet the
[34:19] bridegroom and five of them were wise
[34:22] and five were foolish okay all 10 took
[34:25] their lamps and went to meet the
[34:26] bridegroom but five were wise five were
[34:28] foolish they that were foolish took
[34:31] their lamps and took no oil with them
[34:34] but the wise took oil in their vessels
[34:36] with their lamps while the bridegroom
[34:38] carried they all slumbered and slept and
[34:40] at midnight there was a cry made behold
[34:42] the bridegroom cometh go you out to meet
[34:46] him midnight is the darkest time of the
[34:50] night then all those virgins arose and
[34:53] trimmed their lamps and the foolish said
[34:55] unto the wise give us of your oil for
[34:58] our lamps are gone out but the wise
[35:00] answered saying not so so gone out so
[35:03] one time they were lit but the wise
[35:05] answered saying not so lest there be not
[35:07] enough for us and you but go you rather
[35:10] to them that sell and buy for
[35:12] yourselves so there's a space of time
[35:15] where the lamps are needed to burn it's
[35:18] not it's not just step out the door
[35:20] there's a space of time where the lamps
[35:22] have to be burning so they said hey we
[35:24] don't have enough we have just enough to
[35:25] last that period of time you go get your
[35:28] own and while they went to BU the
[35:31] bridegroom came and they that were ready
[35:32] went in with him to the marriage and the
[35:35] door was shut afterward came also the
[35:38] other virgin saying Lord Lord open to us
[35:40] so this would imply they went they
[35:42] bought oil and they came back but they
[35:44] were too late but he answered and said
[35:47] verily I say unto you I know you not so
[35:49] no
[35:50] relationship watch therefore for you
[35:52] know neither the day nor the hour
[35:54] wherein the son of man
[35:56] cometh John chapter
[36:00] 3 John 3 verse
[36:11] one so
[36:12] Nicodemus here in the scripture there
[36:15] was a man of the Pharisees named
[36:19] Nicodemus a ruler of the Jews the same
[36:22] came to Jesus by night and said unto him
[36:24] Rabbi we know that thou art a teacher
[36:26] come from God
[36:28] for no man can do these Miracles that
[36:30] thou doest except God be with him Jesus
[36:33] answered and said unto him verily verily
[36:35] I say unto thee except him born again he
[36:38] cannot see the kingdom of
[36:40] God Nicodemus saith unto him how can a
[36:43] man be born when he is old can he enter
[36:45] the second time into his mother's womb
[36:47] and be born Jesus answered verely verily
[36:50] brother B says absolutely absolutely I
[36:53] say unto thee except a man be born of
[36:56] water and of the and of the spirit he
[36:59] cannot enter into the kingdom of God
[37:02] that which is born of the flesh is flesh
[37:04] and that which is born of the spirit is
[37:06] Spirit Marvel not that I say unto thee
[37:08] you must be born again the wind bloweth
[37:10] where it listeth and thou hearest the
[37:12] sound thereof but can not tell whence it
[37:14] cometh and whether it goeth so is
[37:16] everyone that is born of the spirit
[37:18] Nicodemus answered and said unto him how
[37:20] can these things be Jesus answered and
[37:23] said unto him art thou a master of
[37:24] Israel and knowest not these things
[37:26] verily verily I I say unto thee we speak
[37:29] that we do know and testify that we have
[37:33] seen and you receive not our witness if
[37:36] I have told you Earthly things and you
[37:38] believe them and you believe not how
[37:40] shall ye believe if I tell you of
[37:42] heavenly things and no man hath ascended
[37:45] up to heaven but he that came down from
[37:47] heaven even the son of man which is in
[37:49] heaven and as Moses lifted up the
[37:51] serpent in the wilderness even so must
[37:53] the son of man be lifted
[37:55] up that whosoever believeth in him
[37:57] should not perish but have everlasting
[38:00] life I know it's long few more verses
[38:02] for God so loved the world that he gave
[38:04] his only begotten son that whosoever
[38:06] believeth in him should not perish but
[38:08] have everlasting life for God sent not
[38:10] his son into the world to condemn the
[38:12] world that the world through him might
[38:14] be saved he that believeth on him is not
[38:16] condemned but he that believeth not is
[38:19] condemned already because he hath not
[38:21] believed in the name of the only
[38:22] begotten Son of
[38:24] God this is the condemnation that light
[38:28] is com into the world he is the light of
[38:32] men right Christ and Men loved Darkness
[38:35] rather than light because their deeds
[38:36] were evil for everyone that doeth evil
[38:39] hateth the light neither cometh to the
[38:42] light lest his deeds should be reproved
[38:45] but he that doeth truth cometh to the
[38:47] light that his deeds may be made
[38:50] manifest that they are wrought in god
[38:52] let's bow our heads Heavenly Father Lord
[38:55] we thank you for your word tonight Lord
[38:57] I pray You' come father with your with
[39:00] the Discerning spirit and speak to us
[39:03] Lord may this may the person of Christ
[39:06] father be be obvious before our view
[39:10] tonight may we see you father in plain
[39:13] view father may you come and open the
[39:15] door of our hearts Lord Jesus father
[39:18] that we would step into a place with you
[39:21] a secret place with you father and we
[39:23] would commune Lord as the word would
[39:25] come forth we would step into that we
[39:27] would push aside even the distractions
[39:29] within the building we would step into a
[39:31] place where it's us with you and you
[39:34] would minister to our hearts Lord may
[39:36] you come and have your way tonight bind
[39:38] every word that would be contrary every
[39:40] opinion of man it may it just be your
[39:42] word pure
[39:44] unadulterated May there be Focus father
[39:47] May there may we not get carried away
[39:49] either side but keep right on the
[39:51] thought we ask in Jesus Christ's name we
[39:53] pray amen you may have your seats
[39:56] tonight
[39:57] so I want to do a bit of review here um
[40:01] to make sure we're all on the same page
[40:04] and if you can't read that that's okay
[40:05] I'll read it for you um
[40:09] so we we've been we're on part three of
[40:11] the breach revealed and and I wanted to
[40:13] kind of kind of remind us why that's our
[40:17] that's our study title and it it comes
[40:20] from the transition brother man preaches
[40:22] the breach between the seven Church ages
[40:25] and the Seven Seals so there's a trans
[40:27] transition there's a point where God in
[40:30] order for in order for the word to be
[40:31] open for the seals to be open the lamb
[40:33] had to take the book so he had to go
[40:35] from what the work he was doing through
[40:37] the church ages he had to step forth and
[40:39] open the book and now we know as we
[40:40] looked in the past couple of of of
[40:43] services that the mercy seed is in the
[40:45] bride of Christ so God continues his
[40:48] ministry in the bride and we say the
[40:51] completion of the seven Church ages we
[40:52] understand we are under the um under the
[40:54] umbrella of the lean age cuz there's a
[40:56] delay
[40:57] the the Bible says time no longer but
[40:59] the word has moved forward into what
[41:01] brother brand calls the bride age amen
[41:04] so we transition at the opening of the
[41:05] word into the bride age and we're not
[41:08] looking back we last service we covered
[41:10] a lot about not looking back to the
[41:12] previous age which would be Pentecost
[41:15] that's the spirit of the frogs in
[41:17] Revelations looking back right the three
[41:19] the three frogs and that's the Trinity
[41:23] so looking back so if you're calling for
[41:25] a word from the previous age you're
[41:27] under the anointing of
[41:29] denominationalism you're under that
[41:31] anointing and it won't give you Victory
[41:34] today you have to take a hold of I am
[41:37] present truth so the reason we're this
[41:41] the breach revealed is because we're
[41:42] we're talking about the change that
[41:44] happened in time in the breach in the
[41:47] separation between the close of
[41:50] Pentecost and the opening of the word
[41:51] and a lot of we we talked about uh the
[41:54] Feast of atonement on the first part and
[41:56] we last time we talked about uh the
[41:58] going back so tonight we want to look at
[42:01] in this space what is revealed from the
[42:04] mystery that's in the virgins and so
[42:10] um we have in here in Genesis chapter 3
[42:13] verse six so now that we've done a bit
[42:14] of review let's get into the sermon
[42:17] tonight I want to look at at a a few
[42:21] different things that you know there's a
[42:23] lot of
[42:25] um we say but it's revealed but there's
[42:29] there's a lot in this story that we want
[42:31] to bring out that comes forth from this
[42:34] this this time this transition of the
[42:36] word and there's a few things we we that
[42:40] we'll touch on but I want to give you a
[42:42] high level uh I want to point to them
[42:44] real quick the holy spirit is the
[42:47] moisture that Waters the
[42:50] seed and when the when the foolish the
[42:55] all the virgins get their lamps and they
[42:57] go forth so they're traveling they're
[42:59] going to this place they're preparing
[43:00] for the bridegroom and in the Terry in
[43:03] the Terry the foolish virgin let the oil
[43:05] from their lamps burn burn
[43:08] out
[43:10] and when the when the cry comes so
[43:13] there's a cry that comes there's a
[43:15] message there's a shout that comes then
[43:19] the then the bride they all get up to go
[43:22] but that happens at midnight The Darkest
[43:26] Hour of the night according according to
[43:27] to science which if you think about it
[43:29] you know brother talks about darkest
[43:31] before Dawn I think midnight one two
[43:34] like that's the middle of the night
[43:36] right it is the darkest before the dawn
[43:39] if you're in Alaska the sun rises at 2
[43:41] in the morning so okay um but once once
[43:46] the bride the other thing is the foolish
[43:48] virgin is not the bride I know that's
[43:51] very obvious but to say in those words
[43:52] for myself really brought a lot of
[43:54] things to light so the foolish virgin is
[43:56] not the bride they were never intended
[43:58] to be the
[43:59] bride amen they were not predestinated
[44:02] to be the bride they will go in the
[44:04] tribulation they will
[44:05] seal their they will seal their lives
[44:08] with their sacrifice the physical
[44:10] sacrifice they will be hunted down and
[44:12] killed and they will rise again after
[44:15] the Millennium and the general
[44:17] resurrection and they are the they are
[44:19] the sheep that are she separated from
[44:21] the goats this is all in the
[44:23] message so that's those things there
[44:27] so in in Genesis
[44:29] 3:6 we I want to look a little bit at at
[44:32] the Hybrid when the woman saw that the
[44:34] tree was good for food and that it was
[44:37] pleasant to the eyes and a tree to be
[44:39] desired to make one wise she took of the
[44:41] fruit thereof and did eat and gave also
[44:43] un her husband with her and he did eat
[44:46] now brother R says a few things in
[44:47] spoken word is the Original
[44:49] Seed and I do apologize this the text is
[44:53] small we're working on that um cuz I'm a
[44:56] Macbook guy in the church is Microsoft
[44:58] so or apple versus Microsoft but in the
[45:02] book word is Original Seed he says the
[45:04] original has the
[45:05] life so so so Adam was the original amen
[45:10] Adam was the original word of God Eve
[45:13] was the
[45:14] byproduct so when Eve she she she tried
[45:17] to take the word of God and mix it with
[45:19] some wisdom and it brought death that's
[45:23] why the flesh is dead and brother says
[45:26] Eve brought forth a hybrid crop yes sir
[45:29] amen
[45:31] so and he was that seed that Eve should
[45:35] have produced so before the word seed
[45:39] could bring forth a crop in Eve he found
[45:43] her pregnated Adam found her already
[45:46] pregnated with the spirit of
[45:48] denomination or the spirit of the
[45:49] Antichrist or the spirit of the serpent
[45:52] the the seed of the serpent so Eve
[45:55] brought forth a hybrid
[45:57] crop
[45:59] so the word mixed with something else
[46:03] that's right that's why it was hybrid
[46:06] amen it can only be hybrid if it's word
[46:08] mixed with something else so Eve was
[46:11] word but she wasn't the original word
[46:14] amen original word will not mix Adam was
[46:17] not deceived he made the choice Amen to
[46:20] receive to to receive Eve back to him so
[46:22] he was not deceived he was complete word
[46:24] there was no way for him to fall to you
[46:28] know Mrs serpent he was original the
[46:32] original word so he has the original
[46:34] life Eve wasn't she was a
[46:38] byproduct and
[46:40] so so then God has to come and and and
[46:44] produce a bride who is the original amen
[46:48] okay
[46:51] so yeah he in that in this he says mix
[46:54] with some wisdom he says you're not
[46:55] supposed to do that that's right so the
[46:59] unbelief in the Garden of Eden hybrid
[47:02] the human
[47:04] race but then says we're we're hybrid he
[47:06] talks about he talks about this hybrid
[47:08] and and we'll come to it the reason
[47:10] we're laying this Foundation is because
[47:11] we'll come to where he talks about the
[47:12] foolish virgin is the
[47:14] hybrid so without the Life of Christ we
[47:17] stay hybrid the flesh so if you think
[47:20] about it the bride of
[47:22] Christ is it's something more it's
[47:26] something more there's there's a there's
[47:28] a life within us that has taken us over
[47:30] but then says you're not you anymore
[47:32] that's right that has to happen
[47:36] otherwise just what happened at the end
[47:38] of the church ages with Pentecost Christ
[47:40] came and found a bride pregnated with
[47:42] denominationalism so he that at that
[47:45] transition there so Eve fell and she
[47:48] mixed it wasn't the original creation
[47:50] she was byproduct of
[47:52] man amen so sometimes I get ahead of my
[47:55] notes here but I have to make sure
[47:57] staying staying in tune so the wise and
[47:59] the foolish version are the Saved church
[48:02] and if you remember last time I I made
[48:04] the comment you know there's just so
[48:06] many
[48:07] quotes yeah that I can't I don't have
[48:10] time to read them so I have footnotes so
[48:12] if you ever want to know where I got
[48:13] this from we can definitely have the
[48:15] conversation but all of this stuff is
[48:17] referenced with with footnotes which I
[48:19] think is fantastic but um
[48:23] so the wise and the foolish version are
[48:26] of the saved church that's right but the
[48:28] bandom says that in the 10 virgins and
[48:29] the 144,000 uh Jews so you have the wise
[48:34] virgins and the foolish virgins now this
[48:35] is this is Virgin so this is Holy clean
[48:39] Sanctified Justified Sanctified okay so
[48:43] so the the the the differences here is
[48:45] that is that the wise they had their
[48:48] lamps full of oil and they were burning
[48:51] the foolish had they had nothing they
[48:53] had the lamp they had the lamp but they
[48:56] had they had nothing they were there
[48:58] they were there waiting on the waiting
[49:00] for the bridegroom so they were in
[49:03] place he and and and and he says so it's
[49:06] it's not a filthy church that's right
[49:08] it's a Sanctified clean church right
[49:10] that's what the saved church is brother
[49:12] B says he says in in in and I think it's
[49:15] the same message they were both on the
[49:17] road he said so it's not enough to just
[49:19] be on the same road that's right so in
[49:22] other words there was a there was a
[49:24] portion of Revelation the foolish virgin
[49:26] had a hold of that's right to to be in
[49:28] that position this is this is this is
[49:31] not the daughters of the this is
[49:34] the Virgin but says they had the seed
[49:37] we'll come to that but they had the seed
[49:41] so he says
[49:45] um in here in broken sistance he said
[49:47] there has to be something there
[49:49] deratization
[49:56] the holy spirit is here now to germatize
[49:58] that and bring it to a reality to you he
[50:03] says all the time it's not the blood
[50:05] it's the life in the blood it's not the
[50:09] seed it's the life in the
[50:12] seed I can have wheat all day long First
[50:16] Age the first church age had the seed
[50:19] but that seed had to be
[50:21] planted they didn't have what we have
[50:23] today we we have to we have to
[50:25] understand that we and when we talk
[50:27] about going back to the original we have
[50:29] to be careful that we're understanding a
[50:31] reprod reproducing of the original the
[50:34] original was Christ we're not trying to
[50:37] impersonate Paul Peter Silas them we're
[50:40] not trying to impersonate them we are
[50:42] trying to get to what the original which
[50:44] was Christ himself and he says he says
[50:48] when he when he opened himself up he was
[50:51] the Holy Spirit that was in the Garden
[50:52] of Eden was to water the seed so Christ
[50:55] was pierced in the side that come forth
[50:58] that water come forth now to water the
[51:00] seed but it has to be gerti or it can
[51:04] never produce life and he he talks about
[51:06] he s the he'll say the woman's
[51:08] seed okay he's talking about that that
[51:11] the there's the two in the equation to
[51:13] bring life you have to have both
[51:14] together but the woman has a seed or
[51:16] different terminology an egg right we
[51:19] have chickens y'all a bunch of us here
[51:20] have have chickens we go out to the
[51:22] thing and we can get eggs all we want
[51:23] not worry about it because there's no
[51:25] rooster
[51:27] right exactly it's a seed it's the
[51:30] potential to be a chicken right but
[51:32] there's no life that's it you see so
[51:34] that's the woman's
[51:36] seed so something has to happen to bring
[51:40] that to pass there has to be a
[51:41] deratization of that
[51:43] seed so the holy spirit that was in the
[51:47] Garden of Eden was to water the seed so
[51:50] the watering the moisture so Christ
[51:52] Christ was the seed true life only comes
[51:56] through him amen and I'm I'm quoting the
[51:58] message true life only comes from him
[52:00] because Christ was the seed so God is a
[52:03] spirit right we understand the Holy
[52:04] Spirit was Christ coming back as the
[52:06] comforter he was that seed coming back
[52:10] there the the the water the washing by
[52:13] the water of the word the water was the
[52:17] word was given to water the seed right
[52:20] you understand you got to have the both
[52:22] because at one point in time the foolish
[52:24] virgin
[52:26] had oil in their lamps yeah amen so
[52:31] wasn't that the end all
[52:33] solution we sometimes we we look at it
[52:37] that
[52:38] way and to make points you know that's
[52:40] fine but if we're not careful we stay
[52:42] there and we forget the fact that
[52:44] there's there was something they had to
[52:46] go to the virgins had to go to what a a
[52:50] be shut in with God they had to come to
[52:52] a place where they shut in so the lamps
[52:54] had a purpose for a season
[52:57] now you hold on to that when I'm not
[52:58] blaspheming you give me a second to pull
[53:00] through this so that was to water the
[53:03] seed so now in in Luke chapter 8: 6 we B
[53:07] references this in this sermon that
[53:08] we're we're speaking a lot from the
[53:10] spoken word it's Original Seed I know
[53:12] it's 6 hours but go home and listen to
[53:14] it um he says in the scripture and some
[53:17] fell upon a rock and as soon as it was
[53:19] sprung up it withered away because it
[53:21] lacked moisture so he makes he's making
[53:24] a point here off of the moisture and he
[53:27] says he says thee first thing you know
[53:29] denomination binds him up into a place
[53:32] and the moisture of the spirit is gone
[53:34] from him so we're in a position now
[53:42] today where we're not talking about a a
[53:46] a a church church member so one of you
[53:49] we're not talking about one of you
[53:50] decides I'm going to go be a
[53:52] Baptist that's not what he's talking
[53:54] about he's talking about the Spirit of
[53:58] denomination and the spirit of
[54:00] denomination at its root is
[54:02] Antichrist but as we saw last time with
[54:05] the frogs it's looking back and what
[54:07] when you look back and say well I'm
[54:09] going to I need that I need what they
[54:11] had back then I didn't live back then
[54:12] but I want to be that there and that
[54:15] thing is is now that's that's a rotten
[54:19] carcass and only vultures eat that and
[54:22] if you start to feed on it you lose
[54:24] moisture that's right that's it okay you
[54:27] lose moisture you say well brother Chris
[54:29] I thought we were sealed up by the Holy
[54:30] Spirit we're getting there we're getting
[54:33] there so he says he says the moisture of
[54:35] the spirit is gone from him so he's
[54:36] directly referencing Luke 8:6 so so this
[54:39] can happen this this takes the moisture
[54:41] from the seed now no life comes from the
[54:43] seed the seed is still sitting there in
[54:45] the rocks and if you found it you wanted
[54:48] to you could eat it right just a piece
[54:50] of wheat or you could take it and go
[54:51] plant it somewhere else it still has the
[54:53] potential but where it's lying the
[54:55] position it's in there is no place for
[54:58] it to come forth and bring forth life
[55:02] the original
[55:05] life so now he says in spoken word it's
[55:09] the Original
[55:11] Seed I'm going to say that a lot so just
[55:14] assume if I don't say I'm referencing
[55:15] this now look the unwise Virgin is going
[55:18] to be the hybrid see she had the seed
[55:22] without the oil the moisture to make it
[55:24] grow right now now I have to be honest
[55:27] for a long time I was puzzled by this
[55:30] till you begin to see that it's it's
[55:31] it's not the
[55:33] seed the seed is not
[55:36] enough the seed is not enough and that I
[55:40] mean that'll choke you if you don't pray
[55:42] about it and seek Revelation the seed is
[55:45] not enough it is the life that comes
[55:48] from the seed amen and the only way to
[55:50] bring the life from the seed is for
[55:53] moisture he says that's the oil which is
[55:56] the holy spirit brings forth the
[55:58] moisture so then you say okay well they
[56:00] had did they just not have the oil long
[56:03] enough in a sense yes but there was
[56:06] something that this was bringing the
[56:08] virgins
[56:10] to this was something that was bringing
[56:13] them to a position for something to
[56:15] happen because if you can have the
[56:17] moisture and then get dried up well then
[56:19] we would all be walking around saying
[56:20] well goodness gracious I hope I don't
[56:22] dry up and be afraid and but if you're
[56:25] the predes a child of God you can't be
[56:30] unsealed you should be having questions
[56:33] right now you should be looking at me
[56:35] very
[56:37] skeptically he says he says the germ
[56:40] that's inside the seed that's the life
[56:44] in the seed that's
[56:46] right and he he talks he talks he talks
[56:50] a lot about about the rain falling on
[56:53] the just and the
[56:54] unjust so this is this is that the holy
[57:00] spirit this is the holy spirit falling
[57:03] whatever the seed you have brings forth
[57:07] that life that's right so you can be in
[57:09] in the in the church be underneath the
[57:12] the Holy Spirit and you're not bringing
[57:15] forth the life you look like the wheat
[57:17] you shout like the wheat but you don't
[57:20] bear the life of the wheat that's right
[57:23] but yet the same rain is providing you
[57:26] the moisture that's right okay so
[57:29] remember though that's wheat and
[57:31] tears that's right the foolish virgin
[57:34] had the wheat seed but they never got
[57:37] the rain they didn't have the moisture
[57:39] enough to bring them to that place where
[57:42] they could well I'm not going to spoil
[57:44] it bring them to the
[57:46] place so they both had the seed right
[57:50] the foolish virgin be believe believed
[57:53] believe I don't know present past tense
[57:55] however you're want to put it they were
[57:56] preparing to meet the Lord along with
[57:58] the bride brother R says that in sudden
[58:02] secret going way of the
[58:04] church they everyone believed in the
[58:07] coming of the
[58:08] Lord in in spoken word is Original Seed
[58:11] he says you can't be a seed and disagree
[58:14] with the word because the word is the
[58:17] seed I I had to prayerfully Ponder on
[58:20] this
[58:20] because because then then he says the
[58:23] seed not he doesn't necessarily say the
[58:25] life of the seed he says the seed and
[58:27] disagree with the word so they agree
[58:29] with the word they believe in with the
[58:32] with the
[58:33] bride because they got the seed but they
[58:36] don't have the life they don't have
[58:39] moisture in their lives to bring forth
[58:43] the life you see you can agree with the
[58:45] word and not bring forth any life the
[58:48] Pharisees agreed with the word tell
[58:52] Jesus came in flesh hope you're catching
[58:55] that came in flesh the word is in flesh
[58:58] again they agreed with it to that point
[59:01] and then they they couldn't receive that
[59:04] they couldn't receive the
[59:06] life word in flesh is very much
[59:10] alive very much alive so there's there's
[59:13] there's nothing to point you say but
[59:15] they're they're clean they're Sanctified
[59:17] they're holy now we're not going to
[59:18] spend the service on the foolish virgin
[59:20] but I'm using this to to to as a
[59:22] foundation of of how you can see then
[59:25] who the bride
[59:26] is okay the bride being the wise virgin
[59:30] so that they both have the
[59:34] seed but when the cry comes
[59:38] forth go you out to meet him now they
[59:42] have to go forth to meet the bridegroom
[59:44] right at that point in time the bride
[59:47] has the oil right their lamps are
[59:51] burning they're ready to go the foolish
[59:53] vergin are not
[59:56] so
[59:57] now what's the lamp's purpose I want to
[1:00:00] look at this a little bit
[1:00:01] here cuz both groups had lamps so if the
[1:00:05] lamps was all you
[1:00:07] needed God wasn't fair the bridegroom
[1:00:10] wasn't fair cuz he said I don't even
[1:00:12] know you but they had the lamp at one
[1:00:14] point they had the fire and the oil and
[1:00:16] the scripture implies that they returned
[1:00:19] to the shut door with oil in the burning
[1:00:21] lamp cuz they it says they went to buy
[1:00:24] and they came back
[1:00:29] so that wasn't enough at that point in
[1:00:31] time okay they were shut out into into
[1:00:35] the
[1:00:36] tribulation now I'm going to say this I
[1:00:39] don't rightly know the position of the
[1:00:41] foolish virgin in present time I do know
[1:00:44] the position of the Bride in present
[1:00:47] time so whether they're out there
[1:00:49] looking whether they're knocking that's
[1:00:51] up to God I'm not going to say either
[1:00:53] way that's up to God but the bride it's
[1:00:56] very plain in the message and in the
[1:00:58] Bible where the bride is and that's all
[1:01:01] that matters right I want to know if I'm
[1:01:04] bride I want to know all about the bride
[1:01:06] if I want to be the bride I want to know
[1:01:07] all about the bride you know if I'm
[1:01:08] trying to be a if I'm trying to be a
[1:01:09] carpenter or a woodworker and I want to
[1:01:11] build you know Japanese style furniture
[1:01:13] so there's no screws no glue everything
[1:01:15] just holds together then I I want to do
[1:01:17] everything I can about that I want to
[1:01:20] become that you know I see a person
[1:01:21] who's really good at that I want to I
[1:01:22] want to do whatever they're doing to do
[1:01:24] to produce the same
[1:01:26] so as the bride of Christ we look in the
[1:01:28] word we see I want to know who the bride
[1:01:30] is how does she act what is she wearing
[1:01:32] because I want to put on the same
[1:01:33] garment I want to be in the same
[1:01:35] position that the bride is in so let's
[1:01:38] look at the lamp's purpose here so in in
[1:01:41] in uh in real quick I I I pulled this
[1:01:44] from the the the Jewish encyclopedia and
[1:01:47] now it was a bit confusing because there
[1:01:49] there's different sect of Jews and and
[1:01:52] and there's uh Jews apparently that that
[1:01:54] after
[1:01:56] after uh ad70 they went into India
[1:02:00] apparently history says so there's these
[1:02:01] different Jews and they all kind of have
[1:02:03] their own different wedding ceremonies
[1:02:05] so I'm I'm not going to I'm not going to
[1:02:07] build the doctrine off of this but it
[1:02:08] just it was just very interesting that
[1:02:10] you that you see in all of this that
[1:02:12] they they used
[1:02:14] torches and different ceremonies the the
[1:02:17] Torches were Incorporated in the process
[1:02:20] sometimes it was a a torch over the
[1:02:22] doorway to the bride's house some and a
[1:02:25] lot of times it was the the ladies with
[1:02:26] the bride Tor had torches carried them
[1:02:29] to the wedding and the or the bridegroom
[1:02:31] came with the Torches like there was
[1:02:33] always this this in this transition
[1:02:35] period of of coming to the bride or
[1:02:37] coming to the bridegroom there was
[1:02:38] always the torch so it was obviously at
[1:02:41] night there's always this this so when
[1:02:44] when Jesus here is is speaking this he's
[1:02:45] speaking this you know I wish we had
[1:02:49] solid evidence of how it did it when
[1:02:50] Jesus gave the the parable but but
[1:02:53] nevertheless he's giving a parable based
[1:02:55] on their traditions of marriage their
[1:02:57] their marriage ceremony one of the one
[1:03:00] of the sect of Jews that they say is was
[1:03:02] was in India way back in the day they
[1:03:05] the the groom would would read uh he
[1:03:08] would be he would read so they would
[1:03:10] have a seventh day feast and on the next
[1:03:13] Sabbath which would be the eighth day he
[1:03:15] would be the eighth person to get up and
[1:03:16] read and he would read he would
[1:03:19] read uh Genesis was it 24 I think where
[1:03:22] elzer goes to get the bride which I
[1:03:25] thought was very cool but um so there's
[1:03:27] a lot of information there but
[1:03:28] regardless there was there was this this
[1:03:30] this time this these torches were used
[1:03:32] and I know this is familiar stuff but
[1:03:34] it's just for me it's good to to touch
[1:03:35] back to the to this here and so in in in
[1:03:39] um so they they take their lamps and
[1:03:41] they go forth to meet him so the the the
[1:03:44] lamp the reason we're saying all this is
[1:03:45] because the lamp holds an important um
[1:03:49] does does a an important job in the
[1:03:52] process of coming to the marriage okay
[1:03:56] so in uh in in Matthew
[1:03:59] 251 they the the Kingdom of Heaven liken
[1:04:01] unto 10 virgins they took their lamps
[1:04:03] yeah hold up get in I don't have this
[1:04:04] one took their lamps and went forth to
[1:04:07] meet the bridegroom so they go forth to
[1:04:08] meet the bridegroom with their
[1:04:10] lambs and like I said in the Terry the
[1:04:13] foolish let their lamps go out because
[1:04:15] they lack the new birth okay they lack
[1:04:19] the new birth so in in um and then in
[1:04:22] Matthew 20 in the same chapter in verse
[1:04:24] 6 he
[1:04:26] the cry comes and then they say go out
[1:04:28] to meet him so there's these two they go
[1:04:30] to meet the bridegroom then there's a
[1:04:32] Terry and then they must go out to meet
[1:04:34] him so they need the lamps they need the
[1:04:35] lamps to get them to Something in Exodus
[1:04:39] 26 think about lamps you have the
[1:04:41] Candlestick right or the manora how they
[1:04:43] call it today and and uh this this is uh
[1:04:46] he says Exodus 26:35 set the table
[1:04:50] without the Veil The Candlestick over
[1:04:51] against the table on the side of the
[1:04:53] Tabernacle toward the South that shall
[1:04:54] put the table on on the North side so
[1:04:56] the Candlestick resided in the Holy
[1:04:59] place or the sanctuary so it was the
[1:05:01] last room or the first room however you
[1:05:04] look at it in the tent before the holy
[1:05:07] holies so Christ dwells behind the veil
[1:05:10] that's right so brother Bram says he
[1:05:13] says that these real quick I just want
[1:05:16] to see
[1:05:18] okay
[1:05:20] so so the the the um the way this was
[1:05:24] lit is this was the this was this is the
[1:05:27] original and the this is lit isn't there
[1:05:30] a thing on here yes there is okay so
[1:05:33] this this is the original this is lit
[1:05:35] this is all olive oil pure olive oil and
[1:05:38] this is lit from the fire off the altar
[1:05:40] so B says that's the original that's
[1:05:42] Christ and then and then the the the
[1:05:44] little thing is blown out and they light
[1:05:46] it off this flame and light the second
[1:05:48] and then they relight it it off the
[1:05:50] second light the third so it goes down
[1:05:52] through the church ages as we'll see now
[1:05:55] there's there's another scripture here
[1:05:57] okay so the way to so the way to the
[1:06:00] veil was lit by the Candlestick it was
[1:06:03] the light in that Sanctuary you got all
[1:06:06] them heavy heavy um coverings and the
[1:06:09] badger skins and all that that outside
[1:06:12] the tent you go inside there it would it
[1:06:13] would be too dark to see your way to the
[1:06:15] veil without the candlesticks so those
[1:06:17] were there glowing and and all the types
[1:06:19] that we have there lighting the high
[1:06:21] priest's way to the veil behind the veil
[1:06:24] there was no need for M for a man-made
[1:06:26] light because Christ himself was there
[1:06:30] so the Candlestick lit the way to The
[1:06:32] Veil The lit the way to the veil of
[1:06:35] Christ okay the fire typing the holy
[1:06:38] spirit for the seven Church ages each
[1:06:41] lamp was lit okay we already went over
[1:06:42] that and then in Psalms he says Thy word
[1:06:46] is a lamp unto my feet and a light unto
[1:06:48] my path amen David C catching a bit of
[1:06:51] Revelation here from the Tabernacle in
[1:06:52] the wilderness and the layout of the
[1:06:54] temple so the word the the the the the
[1:06:57] the Candlestick the the representing the
[1:06:59] Holy Spirit the word through the church
[1:07:01] Ages was the light the light to the path
[1:07:05] where where are we going we're coming
[1:07:07] back to God in flesh we're coming back
[1:07:10] to Christ the complete person of Christ
[1:07:13] to us unveiled before us the unveiling
[1:07:16] of God and then the invisible Union of
[1:07:18] the bride of Christ so God veiled in
[1:07:20] flesh again so we're we're we're coming
[1:07:22] down this I'm going to slow down we're
[1:07:24] coming down this to this path to the way
[1:07:26] so the lamp is lighting our way to the
[1:07:31] veil and just he says it it's wonderful
[1:07:33] type of the holy spirit in the seven
[1:07:35] Church ages he says the original
[1:07:37] outpouring of Pentecost which outpouring
[1:07:39] came direct from Jesus on The Mercy Seat
[1:07:42] is end doing his church through all
[1:07:44] seven ages so it's from The Mercy Seat
[1:07:47] that you have Christ on The Mercy Seat
[1:07:49] there behind the veil you have these
[1:07:51] candlesticks there and we have this this
[1:07:53] uh drawing here of the seven Church ages
[1:07:55] and by and put on the candlesticks and
[1:07:57] then that's the the measure of or how
[1:07:59] much light he saw although he did say
[1:08:01] this was total
[1:08:03] darkness he says I can't see past 1977
[1:08:07] now enter my personal opinion that was
[1:08:09] the close of Pentecost that he saw the
[1:08:12] total darkness because the church going
[1:08:13] back to denomination but the word was
[1:08:16] coming and the word is that sliver of
[1:08:18] light he put in there to signify there's
[1:08:20] a bride in the last age in the darkness
[1:08:23] in the Terry in the time no longer
[1:08:26] so at the after the
[1:08:29] first man we're we're cruising after the
[1:08:33] first church age the word was hidden
[1:08:36] again behind the veil so God Christ came
[1:08:40] he died on the
[1:08:44] cross my wife told me last time I was
[1:08:46] too fast I'm going to really try to slow
[1:08:47] down right
[1:08:48] here cuz I get excited I I'm in my study
[1:08:52] and and like I just don't even know what
[1:08:54] to do with myself have to the time I I
[1:08:57] don't know what's I don't know what's
[1:09:00] going on but every time I go to the book
[1:09:04] I I it's almost to I can't even contain
[1:09:06] it I can't I can't even I can hardly I
[1:09:10] can hardly keep my senses about am and
[1:09:12] I'm not trying to overp spiritualize
[1:09:14] myself but when you begin to get into
[1:09:15] the book and you get into the substance
[1:09:17] of the book you the word comes to life
[1:09:21] in in such in in in depths that you you
[1:09:24] you saw the surface before you
[1:09:27] understood the surface before you
[1:09:28] understood the writing on the outside
[1:09:30] right but you begin to look between the
[1:09:32] lines and you're looking on something
[1:09:34] that's never been talked about Even
[1:09:37] Heaven said sh amen and there was
[1:09:40] silence you get into this place and then
[1:09:42] and then you know you just kind of
[1:09:44] forget yourself and that's all you want
[1:09:45] to do is is just is feed on the word and
[1:09:48] feed more and and and and and as a
[1:09:51] minister studying this there's just so
[1:09:54] much
[1:09:55] that that I have to and maybe I pulled
[1:09:58] maybe I I sifted too much but um you
[1:10:02] know it's it's I'm I'm realizing as
[1:10:04] we've been given the opportunity here a
[1:10:05] few services in a row that it's best if
[1:10:07] I can do small doses then you can
[1:10:10] meditate on that but I I want to slow
[1:10:13] down because as a man I can get up here
[1:10:14] I can get going too fast and then I get
[1:10:16] in the
[1:10:17] way but we let the the the the Lord come
[1:10:21] and speak to our hearts so I'll try to
[1:10:24] slow down so after the we we see and I
[1:10:27] and I have a drawing and I just I
[1:10:29] haven't transferred it enough yet I Dre
[1:10:31] it on paper and I'm trying to get it out
[1:10:33] like this but I just I didn't have the
[1:10:34] time to complete it but I will have it
[1:10:36] probably in the next one of the next
[1:10:38] Parts but um when when when God came and
[1:10:42] and he and he and he died on the cross
[1:10:44] he he he completed the
[1:10:46] sacrifice he redeemed redeemed the
[1:10:49] people redeemed the people of the book
[1:10:53] the veil was rent in the H holy the
[1:10:55] holiest now they had access to
[1:10:59] Christ and then and then he comes with
[1:11:01] the Holy Spirit down upon them in the
[1:11:03] upper room okay so this is
[1:11:06] transition but the Original Seed had to
[1:11:10] go in the ground to bring forth a
[1:11:14] crop so down it went and how did it go
[1:11:17] down you say oh my goodness you know the
[1:11:20] csil of NAA how terrible it was all in
[1:11:22] the hand of God cuz he had to bury the
[1:11:24] seed amen
[1:11:26] what was it it was denominationalism the
[1:11:29] spirit of the
[1:11:30] Antichrist buried the seed it's always
[1:11:33] the same Spirit burying the seed but
[1:11:37] buries the seed Now we move we move
[1:11:41] from from the holy place if you will in
[1:11:43] history to the sanctuary then out of
[1:11:46] that to the outer court till we're
[1:11:48] outside the gate and then and then as
[1:11:50] the word comes brother bam says outer
[1:11:52] court is justification inner court is
[1:11:54] sanctification holies of holies is the
[1:11:56] baptism of the Holy Spirit and and so if
[1:11:58] you think about it when we were outside
[1:12:00] the gate then came Sardis with Luther
[1:12:04] and we got justification so we were back
[1:12:06] in this in the outer
[1:12:08] Court okay then we had Philadelphia
[1:12:10] Wesley he took a sanctification to the
[1:12:13] to the inner Court uh the the the
[1:12:17] sanctuary the holy place and then
[1:12:19] Pentecost in leoda took us back into the
[1:12:22] holiest of
[1:12:24] holies okay okay but but that's but that
[1:12:27] um took us back to the holy spirit so
[1:12:30] restored it
[1:12:32] back but all the while it was this
[1:12:35] lampstand the Candlestick lighting the
[1:12:37] way back to something now Theo now the
[1:12:41] holy spirit gives you access to the holy
[1:12:44] place but do you know what you're
[1:12:45] looking at do you understand what's
[1:12:47] behind the veil do you have an
[1:12:49] understanding of Christ are you or are
[1:12:51] you just walking in and and and that's
[1:12:53] it are you or are you getting a
[1:12:55] relationship with Christ are you getting
[1:12:57] shut in with Christ in that secret place
[1:13:00] amen
[1:13:03] so it was lighting the way back to the
[1:13:06] veiled
[1:13:10] word and and and the angel of the Lord
[1:13:12] tells him you know he shows him the the
[1:13:15] I think it's the big auditori Auditorium
[1:13:17] in the tent or whatever it is the light
[1:13:19] goes over the tent and he says I'll meet
[1:13:21] you in there that's the third pull so in
[1:13:24] other words there's a place we must go
[1:13:25] there's something we're going to be shut
[1:13:27] into it's a secret amen it's a
[1:13:30] secret and we must get to there so we we
[1:13:34] are then taking the lamp and we are
[1:13:38] going to meet
[1:13:40] Christ and the lamp which is the holy
[1:13:42] type of the Holy Spirit the oil is type
[1:13:44] of the Holy Spirit the lamp is lit
[1:13:46] bringing us to that
[1:13:47] place so in in well back here to Matthew
[1:13:51] 25 and while they went to buy the
[1:13:54] bridegroom came and they that were ready
[1:13:57] went in with him to the marriage and the
[1:14:00] door was shut amen that's
[1:14:07] right so the
[1:14:10] lamps brought the
[1:14:13] bride to the bridegroom
[1:14:17] amen but there's something but
[1:14:20] says Beyond Pentecost that's right
[1:14:24] there's something
[1:14:28] more there there there's this there's
[1:14:30] this Christ in flesh if if if the lamp
[1:14:33] was enough then then we wouldn't then
[1:14:36] then that would be Christ in
[1:14:37] flesh there has to be
[1:14:40] relationship because he says it's Christ
[1:14:43] again in his bride ready right here I I
[1:14:46] got a quote right here not Twain but one
[1:14:51] that's right they are one not they will
[1:14:53] be that's right
[1:14:55] present tense they are one a husband and
[1:14:58] a wife is no longer two but one that's
[1:15:01] exactly
[1:15:02] right and Christ and his body is one and
[1:15:06] the Same Spirit was in Christ as in his
[1:15:09] bride in his body that unites them
[1:15:13] together with all the word and God
[1:15:15] living in there himself that's right
[1:15:18] manifested he says Christ
[1:15:22] came well I but there was the the it was
[1:15:25] pregnated the church was pregnated by
[1:15:32] denomination he came to impregnate
[1:15:34] himself into the womb of the Bride is
[1:15:38] God then a fornicator
[1:15:40] no so where are we in Matthew 25 that's
[1:15:44] it the door shut that's right the bride
[1:15:49] is in with the
[1:15:50] bridegroom where are the foolish virgin
[1:15:52] in this space of time I don't know I
[1:15:54] have opinions but I'm not going to say
[1:15:56] them but the bride has gone to this
[1:15:58] place you see it in 62 brother Bram says
[1:16:02] Christ is engaged well guess what before
[1:16:05] the opening of the word he was that's
[1:16:08] right he was that was the shout the
[1:16:12] bridegroom's coming the bridegroom is
[1:16:14] coming that was the shout he was engaged
[1:16:18] now today 2024 he is married to the
[1:16:22] bride the wedding supper is the
[1:16:24] celebration
[1:16:25] after the marriage that's right and the
[1:16:28] honeymoon is after the wedding supper
[1:16:30] the Thousand Years in the Millennium so
[1:16:33] this is where we are so the lamps had
[1:16:35] their purpose it it's the holy the oil
[1:16:38] is the holy spirit lighting the lamps
[1:16:40] leading the way to Christ and when you
[1:16:43] get in that place with Christ that's the
[1:16:45] new
[1:16:46] birth that's why you see it's so hard
[1:16:49] you look one place but says absolutely
[1:16:50] the holy spirit is not the new birth
[1:16:52] then he says the holy spirit is the new
[1:16:53] birth and he say says it's the seed you
[1:16:55] as long as you have the seed gen of God
[1:16:57] in you you're good to go then he says
[1:16:59] it's not the seed it's the life in the
[1:17:00] seed that's right you see 6 to1 half
[1:17:03] dozen or the other it's the same thing
[1:17:05] because if you have the lamp if you have
[1:17:07] the Holy Spirit and the light you're
[1:17:09] going to get the new birth in this point
[1:17:12] of time in this space of time but if you
[1:17:14] T too long and let your life go
[1:17:18] out let your life go out you will find
[1:17:22] yourself in the wrong position so you
[1:17:25] have to get to Christ you say oh I don't
[1:17:28] want to be the foolish virgin guess what
[1:17:29] then marry Christ get into that place
[1:17:32] with Christ step into that place with
[1:17:34] him how do you do that is there a place
[1:17:36] you go is there a church you go to is
[1:17:38] there a a mountain you go hiking to is
[1:17:41] there a place in the wilderness you go
[1:17:42] camping alone is there is there a
[1:17:44] meetings in the midwest meetings in the
[1:17:46] east coast meetings on the west coast
[1:17:48] that we have to go to to get there no he
[1:17:51] says it's a secret I'll meet you in
[1:17:53] there so in other words when you you
[1:17:54] begin to see Christ between the
[1:17:57] lines you're having an intimate
[1:17:59] relationship with him because the
[1:18:01] outside world knows nothing about
[1:18:04] it the world has
[1:18:07] polluted intimacy but true intimacy the
[1:18:11] world outside knows nothing about it
[1:18:13] true Intimacy in a marriage between a
[1:18:15] husband and wife the world knows nothing
[1:18:17] about it it's just something they share
[1:18:19] so no wonder people get confused when
[1:18:21] you say read between the lines that's it
[1:18:24] or they tried to read between the lines
[1:18:25] without being in Christ and they just
[1:18:27] get way off or they say no you're
[1:18:31] getting too
[1:18:33] complicated we simplify what's
[1:18:35] complicated and we complicated
[1:18:37] complicate what's
[1:18:39] simplified we look at the word oh the
[1:18:41] seals the seals and we'll miss it but
[1:18:45] says it's
[1:18:46] simple it's simple yet as you get into
[1:18:49] it into the word of God it becomes more
[1:18:52] simple you get more Revelation about it
[1:18:54] but it's not something you just happen
[1:18:57] upon so in in a sense it's complicated
[1:19:00] because you don't just happen upon it
[1:19:02] you have to be studious you have to
[1:19:04] pursue Christ while at the same time
[1:19:07] Christ is pursuing you
[1:19:09] so I just love it I just love it love
[1:19:12] the word of God so you're you're pulling
[1:19:14] more into Christ so Christ's body United
[1:19:17] as his bride being one they're not two
[1:19:19] anymore they're one God living in there
[1:19:22] himself manifested this is why why
[1:19:25] people are calling for the Holy
[1:19:27] Ghost okay I might as well say my
[1:19:29] opinion they're calling for the Holy
[1:19:30] Ghost calling for a Revival that's the
[1:19:33] spirit of the foolish
[1:19:35] virgin amen the bride set calls for more
[1:19:38] of the word amen the Holy Spirit now I I
[1:19:42] want you to just pray about this the
[1:19:44] Holy Spirit isn't enough that's right
[1:19:47] you need the new birth said brother
[1:19:49] Chris you just contradicted yourself not
[1:19:51] if you're thinking clearly not if you
[1:19:53] got your spiritual cap on or he says
[1:19:55] what brother say put your coat
[1:19:57] on right because that gets you to that
[1:20:00] place that is the vehicle that brings
[1:20:02] you to the New Birth it's not enough to
[1:20:04] just hold the lamp if it was there would
[1:20:06] be no separation between the wise and
[1:20:08] the foolish cuz they wouldn't got the
[1:20:09] oil so well just the wrong
[1:20:12] time
[1:20:14] okay but that's not enough the bride had
[1:20:18] to go to the bridegroom the lamp led her
[1:20:22] and the Word was unveiled to the bride
[1:20:24] now she's in a place where her lamp will
[1:20:27] never go out because she shines Not By
[1:20:30] the Light of a lamp but by the Light of
[1:20:33] Christ himself a sustained light there
[1:20:37] is no draining of the oil you see before
[1:20:40] that reunion with Christ there's a
[1:20:42] draining of the oil but you step into
[1:20:44] that Union with Christ the oil never
[1:20:47] runs out Elisha a type of the Bride says
[1:20:50] go get you need to pay your bills you
[1:20:52] need to you need to make KS meat we tell
[1:20:54] oh yeah what a nice story but there's a
[1:20:56] deep within that the oil never ran out
[1:21:00] you see when you get the bride becomes
[1:21:02] in her position carrying on the ministry
[1:21:05] of Christ the oil never runs
[1:21:07] out so as the bride of Christ you will
[1:21:10] be
[1:21:11] compelled compelled and driven to spend
[1:21:15] time with God to get more of his word to
[1:21:18] get more Revelation about you can't I
[1:21:20] have a quote I have a quote here I have
[1:21:22] a quote
[1:21:38] okay I'll just jump to it he says Christ
[1:21:40] is a mystery of God revealed you can't
[1:21:43] commit adultery you're already pregnated
[1:21:47] amen he can't take a hold the womb the
[1:21:51] denomination the womb of life is closed
[1:21:53] to anything else you're already his by
[1:21:57] predestination the seed has come to life
[1:22:01] amen so there's no fear there's no
[1:22:03] running out of oil how can you say I'm
[1:22:05] not Christ when Christ himself is in you
[1:22:08] pushing
[1:22:09] forth
[1:22:11] so not Twain but one he says he's going
[1:22:15] to sew his seed somebody is going to get
[1:22:18] it because they're predestinated to be a
[1:22:22] they're they're predestinated to be a
[1:22:23] church at the the end of the road amen
[1:22:27] signifying that consummation of the
[1:22:29] marriage happens here that's
[1:22:32] right happens here so in Matthew 25 I
[1:22:35] ask you where are we
[1:22:39] amen where are we you see it's so close
[1:22:43] it would deceive the very elect if it
[1:22:46] was
[1:22:47] possible the Virgin the foolish
[1:22:50] virgin so
[1:22:53] close they got the word they agree with
[1:22:55] the word they go to church with you
[1:22:57] that's right absolutely they confess the
[1:22:59] word they they they'll even get excited
[1:23:02] about it but there's no relationship
[1:23:05] that's it that's exactly so you go
[1:23:07] outside of church and you you're
[1:23:09] confused by their actions you're
[1:23:11] confused by their interests you're
[1:23:13] confused by their family life you're
[1:23:15] confused by the disorder in their home
[1:23:17] are we saying people in this place are
[1:23:19] foolish virgin absolutely
[1:23:21] not but it stands true that if that is
[1:23:24] the behavior of the foolish virgin who
[1:23:27] have the seed but no
[1:23:29] moisture it stands true that a child of
[1:23:31] God can have dryness in their life and
[1:23:35] they aren't bringing forth the
[1:23:37] word because they've not yet come to
[1:23:39] that place you see that's why I I keep
[1:23:42] saying through this series God isn't
[1:23:44] always
[1:23:45] linear the bride is shut in with Christ
[1:23:48] yet there are seed of God who are coming
[1:23:50] to the revelation of who they are so
[1:23:54] it's not cuz brother says it's not a
[1:23:56] group it's individual right it's
[1:24:01] individual so individually speaking
[1:24:03] there are those who just have the lamp
[1:24:04] and the and the
[1:24:06] fire but they will come to a revelation
[1:24:09] of Christ himself but until they get to
[1:24:12] that
[1:24:13] place we don't we want to leave them in
[1:24:16] God's hands but there is nothing wrong
[1:24:19] with looking at that and saying that's
[1:24:22] not Christ you might be a child of God
[1:24:25] but your behavior is not
[1:24:28] Christ that's not judging that's not
[1:24:31] judgmental because if we just said oh
[1:24:34] Grace for everybody be whatever you
[1:24:38] want then no one will be compelled we're
[1:24:41] supposed to compel by the word compel
[1:24:45] our brother compel our sister sometimes
[1:24:48] even say you know what are you sure that
[1:24:50] you say this but this is what the word
[1:24:52] says are you sure all in love you see
[1:24:55] but it's a it's iron sharpening iron
[1:24:56] we're not called up here to just look
[1:24:59] saints of God when you begin to see this
[1:25:00] you realize we don't have any time we
[1:25:03] are in the de we are in the delay time
[1:25:07] no
[1:25:08] longer if you look at the Timeline 7,000
[1:25:11] years second 7,000 years we're at
[1:25:15] 6,000 the next thousand is supposed to
[1:25:18] be the Millennium so we're in this space
[1:25:19] of time where there's a delay you should
[1:25:22] be you should be not Not Afraid not like
[1:25:27] oh goodness driving down the road
[1:25:28] looking for like Locust with long hair
[1:25:30] you shouldn't be living your life like
[1:25:32] that or in fear of all this stuff like I
[1:25:34] miss it and I miss it and you come home
[1:25:36] and everyone's gone they're supposed to
[1:25:37] be there I missed the
[1:25:39] Rapture not like that but a but we got
[1:25:43] to get rid of the
[1:25:45] apathy that's right we have to get rid
[1:25:48] of the apathy we don't have time to mess
[1:25:50] around we we have to get into the word
[1:25:52] of God and then when you're in the word
[1:25:54] of God you have to keep in the word of
[1:25:56] God you have to keep in that place
[1:26:03] amen Lord help
[1:26:06] us you see this and you and you read the
[1:26:09] word and you understand this is within
[1:26:12] the
[1:26:13] church because it's the saved
[1:26:16] church at this point in time you know I
[1:26:19] just I personally I can't see that being
[1:26:22] denominations they're not clean even if
[1:26:25] they're even if they're preaching truth
[1:26:26] their lives aren't clean they're not
[1:26:28] they're they're they're you know at the
[1:26:29] pool in shorts they're they're they're
[1:26:31] they're cutting their hair that they
[1:26:33] might be touching on the word that we
[1:26:35] see is truth but there was there was
[1:26:36] truth in Pentecost I was listening to a
[1:26:38] Pentecostal preacher it popped up and I
[1:26:40] watched it he believes in baptism in the
[1:26:42] name of Jesus Christ he believes in in
[1:26:44] in the not in the Trinity and all this
[1:26:46] stuff and and it's I mean it's chaos you
[1:26:48] know they're speaking in tongues he's
[1:26:50] preaching about the name of the Lord it
[1:26:51] must be done in the name of the Lord and
[1:26:53] it's all true
[1:26:55] but it you have to remember that there
[1:26:57] was truth in
[1:26:58] Pentecost and that
[1:27:00] truth says it doesn't go away it carries
[1:27:03] into the next age and there's more to it
[1:27:07] there's more revelation of the word as
[1:27:08] it transitions so there's more oh the
[1:27:11] name of the Lord the name of the Lord
[1:27:12] yes but what are you going to do with
[1:27:14] This Man Called
[1:27:16] Jesus that's right he that is in you
[1:27:20] right the invisible Union of the bride
[1:27:22] of Christ so it's good it's truth but it
[1:27:26] doesn't give them victory in their lives
[1:27:28] because it's the message of the past age
[1:27:31] they need the whole truth so you see
[1:27:34] this and you watch that and I and I say
[1:27:36] this with with love in my heart and
[1:27:38] sincerity but there's a lot of message
[1:27:40] preaching and that's all it
[1:27:42] is if that was enough I could go join
[1:27:45] the Pentecost that's right if that's all
[1:27:48] I need I could go to there true
[1:27:51] evangelism is not preaching like a
[1:27:53] Pentecostal preacher that's right true
[1:27:56] evangelism brother says is is bringing
[1:27:58] conviction down upon your heart and
[1:28:00] saying you're not living right that's
[1:28:01] right I thought I was going to preach
[1:28:03] this time on the balance of the fold
[1:28:05] Ministry but maybe that's part four but
[1:28:07] you see true evang we have this idea in
[1:28:09] our head that evangelism is is
[1:28:11] simplified
[1:28:13] word evangelism is still the present
[1:28:15] word for our day that's right amen so do
[1:28:18] we have do we have
[1:28:21] evangelists or do we have men who don't
[1:28:24] have have a revelation of the open word
[1:28:25] that's it and they can say the words
[1:28:28] third pole Seven
[1:28:30] Seals but they Don't Preach third pole
[1:28:34] Seven Seals they are preaching like
[1:28:36] Pentecostals amen the Bride of Jesus
[1:28:39] Christ can not survive on that meat amen
[1:28:42] they need the substance of the word they
[1:28:44] need the present day word which is the
[1:28:46] opening of the seals so we just got to
[1:28:49] preach every message on the seals if you
[1:28:51] understand what the seals is the answer
[1:28:53] is yes because it's Christ revealed to
[1:28:56] you you can't see the message the same
[1:28:59] way you can't look I can't saints of God
[1:29:02] I cannot take this book and look at it
[1:29:04] like a Pentecostal because I have seen
[1:29:06] the greater truth I have seen who God is
[1:29:10] am amen and in doing so I realized how
[1:29:13] much more I want to see of him amen but
[1:29:16] I can't survive but you say but it's
[1:29:18] truth and it's in the message it is but
[1:29:21] the message progressed through
[1:29:24] dispensations there was a point in the
[1:29:26] message where he Christ was engaged but
[1:29:28] then there's a point in the message
[1:29:30] where your Miss Jesus
[1:29:32] Christ there is a progression so if if
[1:29:36] this is why people get get off in left
[1:29:38] field and say Well only after 63 no take
[1:29:41] what you read before the seals and
[1:29:43] filter it through the open word that's
[1:29:45] right brother says love is the Holy
[1:29:47] Ghost that's it don't stop it there pull
[1:29:50] it through the open word oh it's not
[1:29:54] he says a lot of other things well I'd
[1:29:56] rather have uh wild fire than no fire at
[1:30:00] all pull it through the uPorn he says
[1:30:03] calm
[1:30:04] down you're missing it you're trying to
[1:30:07] get fire he says careful you don't get
[1:30:08] the gift without the giver he brings it
[1:30:11] into balance that's why his church split
[1:30:14] right which if you think about it is an
[1:30:16] amazing
[1:30:18] type Pentecost split from the bride age
[1:30:21] that's right they went back and if
[1:30:23] you're not careful of you're caught in
[1:30:24] the Pentecostal age what happens when
[1:30:26] there's a transition and we covered this
[1:30:28] already but I for your remembrance sake
[1:30:30] for those of you who weren't here when
[1:30:31] you're caught in the transition previous
[1:30:34] age will persecute current age that's it
[1:30:37] that's
[1:30:39] it if if if somebody says they have more
[1:30:43] truth than you and they come at you
[1:30:46] combatively that is not the spirit of
[1:30:48] Christ right if they're posting on
[1:30:51] social media to make points to show you
[1:30:54] your wrong that is not the spirit
[1:30:57] Christ therefore don't be
[1:30:59] deceived when they say Lo here is Christ
[1:31:02] or there here is Christ don't believe it
[1:31:04] amen take it to the word amen take it we
[1:31:09] we we can't like I understand you know
[1:31:11] immediately all of us are thinking of
[1:31:13] people maybe or churches but I'm not
[1:31:15] saying that at all but you you have to
[1:31:17] understand like you can't just give this
[1:31:19] a casual
[1:31:20] look this is truth or nontruth that's
[1:31:23] right this is Eagle food or vulture food
[1:31:27] and a True Body of Christ won't survive
[1:31:29] underneath that kind of
[1:31:31] ministry you will starve to
[1:31:35] death amen you will start to look
[1:31:38] elsewhere for something to feed you and
[1:31:41] eventually either God will change the
[1:31:42] heart of the pastor or he'll move you
[1:31:44] that's exactly because you have to go to
[1:31:47] truth the bride can't survive off of
[1:31:51] that amen so you realize that and you
[1:31:53] see this and then you and then all of
[1:31:55] this stuff comes from
[1:31:57] it I'm not saying figure out who's
[1:32:00] preaching nontruth
[1:32:03] don't even worry about them that's
[1:32:06] exactly right I'm saying be careful
[1:32:08] you're not underneath that's it the
[1:32:10] anointing of a previous age make sure
[1:32:13] you aren't the anointing of present
[1:32:16] truth amen the only way to do that is to
[1:32:18] get to Christ amen to open your book to
[1:32:22] challenge the status
[1:32:25] quot to challenge what you hear what is
[1:32:28] preached go back to it go to the word
[1:32:32] study the word
[1:32:34] amen but most of all just be more
[1:32:41] sincere we do a lot of goof and off when
[1:32:44] it comes to church I've done it I do it
[1:32:47] sometimes and I see it sometimes and if
[1:32:50] we're not careful we just say oh that's
[1:32:51] the spirit of the age and we excuse it
[1:32:55] you know it's like brother Bram he's
[1:32:56] talking about he talks about um um Mary
[1:33:00] Magdalene I think it is delivered of the
[1:33:01] seven demons and he lists them stress
[1:33:11] Pride we and so what I'm the point I'm
[1:33:13] making is if we're not careful we just
[1:33:14] excuse things that are are Flatout
[1:33:18] demons but the that's the Pentecost
[1:33:20] because why God smiled upon it so to
[1:33:24] excuse well that's a little thing well
[1:33:27] what what's a big
[1:33:28] thing that's a little sin what's a big
[1:33:31] sin depending on who you are if you're
[1:33:34] Mafia you know little sin is only
[1:33:36] killing one guy a month big sin is you
[1:33:39] know 40 guys a month right it's not it's
[1:33:43] not about what's big what's little and
[1:33:45] if we're not careful we we that's why
[1:33:47] I'm saying it's so important that we
[1:33:48] come into the present truth of our age
[1:33:50] because underneath Pentecost underneath
[1:33:52] that age God smiles upon a lot of things
[1:33:55] but no longer does he do that that's
[1:33:57] right he draws a straight line for the B
[1:34:01] calls it a Razor's Edge that's exactly
[1:34:04] right amen so therefore in order for us
[1:34:06] to get to the place we need to be we
[1:34:09] have to be more sincere we have to say
[1:34:12] is this right something that that
[1:34:15] everyone accepts a behavior that
[1:34:17] everyone accepts but something niggles
[1:34:19] at your heart don't ignore and just say
[1:34:22] well it's just it's just that it's just
[1:34:24] little go to prayer go to the word say
[1:34:27] God is this right and if it is then God
[1:34:30] will show you and if it's not right he
[1:34:32] will show you to fix it amen it's
[1:34:36] important that we come to church y it's
[1:34:39] important that we are in the house of
[1:34:40] God
[1:34:41] because we must be preaching fful
[1:34:43] Ministry the next part because it
[1:34:46] because it's the fful ministry is is
[1:34:48] what's given to perfect the bride amen
[1:34:53] and he's given you a church streaming is
[1:34:57] not streaming is the devil's gray area
[1:35:00] that's it for you to get fivefold
[1:35:02] Ministry look you can press play on the

[1:35:34] church for the simplest things I I ask
[1:35:37] you to do this I ask you to do this
[1:35:40] audit the last two months of your life
[1:35:44] of how many times you've been in
[1:35:46] church you see we we go through life and
[1:35:49] we think oh we just you know we just
[1:35:50] missed a couple Services here and there
[1:35:52] and then if you actually go back and
[1:35:54] look at it it's like oh I've only bought
[1:35:56] a few coffees and then you balance your
[1:35:58] account you're like wow that's $150 in
[1:36:01] coffee that wasn't a couple coffees AIT
[1:36:04] he said that's so psychological the holy
[1:36:06] spirit is the greatest psychologist that
[1:36:08] I
[1:36:09] know dividing aunder the very thoughts
[1:36:12] and intents of the heart amen go back
[1:36:15] and audit it say okay did I go to church
[1:36:17] Wednesday that I go to church Sunday and
[1:36:19] look at the list you know this is simple
[1:36:21] but this is something for somebody
[1:36:24] and go from there and say if it's if
[1:36:25] it's really lacking then you just you
[1:36:27] know get back on track because God is
[1:36:31] faithful I'm bringing this down to a
[1:36:33] close
[1:36:34] here so why didn't Pentecost bring the
[1:36:39] marriage they were pregnated by the
[1:36:41] spirit of denomination y that is the
[1:36:44] close of the seven Church ages so the
[1:36:46] the seven Church the the the the seven
[1:36:48] Church ages does not bring the
[1:36:50] impregnation of the Bride it brings the
[1:36:52] bride to the place she needs to be it's
[1:36:55] the light to the place she needs to be
[1:36:57] to become impregnated with Christ Christ
[1:37:00] isn't going to marry a hor and Christ
[1:37:02] found Pentecost in
[1:37:04] adultery but the bride of Christ brought
[1:37:07] forth by the call from the bridegroom
[1:37:09] won't be found the
[1:37:11] same he's coming back for a bride amen
[1:37:14] you see there's three comings of Christ
[1:37:18] yes but the son of man came in our day
[1:37:20] yes sir amen I was talking to a brother
[1:37:22] and you would know if I said his by name
[1:37:24] said him by name a a wellestablished
[1:37:26] brother with with great revelation of
[1:37:28] the word but he told me he said
[1:37:29] something had happened and he and he and
[1:37:31] in his church and he was in his position
[1:37:33] now and he went to the word for months
[1:37:35] and he studied the word and he took I
[1:37:37] think it says the seals through 65 and
[1:37:40] he said I went through and I studied in
[1:37:42] a sentence what did we miss what did we
[1:37:44] miss why is the church in this condition
[1:37:46] and he said I I came to the place I
[1:37:48] realized we miss the coming of Christ
[1:37:51] that's
[1:37:52] it we're not looking we're not looking
[1:37:55] for for a return besides the Rapture
[1:37:58] that's it that's right the son of man
[1:38:00] has come that's right as in the days of
[1:38:02] the coming of the son of man whatever
[1:38:04] that days is we're living in it that's
[1:38:06] right he has come what was the cloud
[1:38:09] amen that was Christ exactly that was
[1:38:12] the coming of because a son of man
[1:38:14] revealed the son of man amen so that was
[1:38:17] Christ amen a son of man but says the
[1:38:22] man that met Moses uh Abra on the back
[1:38:24] side of the desert he says God in flesh
[1:38:25] like a prophet that's it he says discern
[1:38:28] Sarah's heart behind his back and then
[1:38:31] he says in there I will return again
[1:38:33] according to the time of life are we
[1:38:35] waiting that return no he came that's
[1:38:39] right he came and what happened Sarah
[1:38:41] got pregnant that's right that all
[1:38:43] that's not all that happened he
[1:38:44] completely changed him you see the bride
[1:38:46] of Christ has to be changed to a
[1:38:48] original word because original word
[1:38:51] won't fail so we are not Eve amen we are
[1:38:56] Mrs Adam amen Mrs second Adam we can't
[1:39:01] be deceived we can't fall let me say it
[1:39:04] this way the bride of Christ can't fall
[1:39:07] that's right careful you don't get a
[1:39:09] arogant spirit say I can't fall right
[1:39:12] right I I I I here we go it bothers me
[1:39:16] that there's some much preaching you're
[1:39:18] the bride you can't fail you're
[1:39:19] Victorious no you're not the bride
[1:39:21] unless you get your life into Christ
[1:39:22] that's right you need to do that first
[1:39:25] okay that was my opinion so amen I said
[1:39:28] we were
[1:39:29] closing spoken word is Original Seed I I
[1:39:32] had to put this in here he says but oh
[1:39:35] God it amazes me how much of this
[1:39:39] message preached in
[1:39:41] 62 is IR relevance to the opening of the
[1:39:43] word he says but oh God there's a germ
[1:39:46] of life come from the real seed that God
[1:39:49] proved it was his seed he rose up again
[1:39:52] see that through that life that's going
[1:39:55] over the Original Seed you see why did
[1:39:58] it rise up again because it was the
[1:39:59] original seed planted in the ground
[1:40:02] that's what he's saying because the
[1:40:04] title is the spoken word is the Original
[1:40:07] Seed he says that through that life
[1:40:09] that's going over the Original Seed like
[1:40:12] was given to Eve over his real church is
[1:40:15] bringing forth life again amen through
[1:40:18] the birth through the womb of his bride
[1:40:22] amen God is not a fornicator
[1:40:27] no we we are impregnated the bride is
[1:40:29] impregnated by the word the same way
[1:40:31] Mary was be it unto me amen according to
[1:40:34] your word what is it a receiving of the
[1:40:36] word amen a rece an accepting of taking
[1:40:41] the
[1:40:43] challenge saying I will receive it amen
[1:40:47] and then
[1:40:48] what Mary with the seed of of of Christ
[1:40:52] you can take her in this and as an
[1:40:55] example of the Bride she goes now Christ
[1:40:57] is on The Mercy Seat of in the bride in
[1:40:59] the heart of the Bride amen she goes to
[1:41:02] she goes to
[1:41:04] Elizabeth and as soon as she sees her
[1:41:06] John comes to life amen I'm not trying
[1:41:09] to make a Doctrine just saying the power
[1:41:11] of God was within her why because she
[1:41:14] received the spoken word we're all
[1:41:15] trying to get the power of God and you
[1:41:17] see that all the time oh the power of
[1:41:18] God what is the power of God is to speak
[1:41:20] life amen what is life life is Christ
[1:41:25] life is the word of God it is not to
[1:41:28] make all the pews fall over or make you
[1:41:30] fall out of the Pew
[1:41:33] no so through the birth through the womb
[1:41:36] of his bride the womb of life is closed
[1:41:39] you're already his that's it the seed
[1:41:42] has come to life you see he says he says
[1:41:44] Christ is the
[1:41:46] water and and in order to bring the seed
[1:41:49] in your heart because the ver SLE
[1:41:50] fullish virgin had the seed the wise
[1:41:52] virgin has the SE seed but then she goes
[1:41:55] in with
[1:41:58] Christ and now she's got the other
[1:42:01] part and it brings forth life that's
[1:42:05] it it brings forth Christ and the full
[1:42:11] manifestation of the impregnated
[1:42:14] bride is the rapture
[1:42:17] amen she's pregnant right now am but Oh
[1:42:21] Glory one of these days we're going to
[1:42:23] have forth a promised son which is
[1:42:25] Christ himself exactly right coming down
[1:42:28] Amen to take his bride away
[1:42:31] amen saints of God it's exciting time

[1:42:45] give honor to him for the marriage of
[1:42:47] the Lamb is come
[1:42:49] amen we're not looking for this to
[1:42:51] happen no
[1:42:53] you don't have to wait for it to happen
[1:42:55] no it is there for you to take a hold of
[1:42:58] today amen there is I I I you
[1:43:06] know this is
[1:43:10] it they you know the world stole that I
[1:43:14] think they saw it somewhere Michael
[1:43:15] Jackson This Is It no that's the bride's
[1:43:17] message this is it amen
[1:43:20] amen this is it if if you're waiting for
[1:43:24] something else you're stuck in the wrong
[1:43:25] age amen this is it amen so all you have
[1:43:29] to do is go into the
[1:43:33] bridegroom Christ how's that how's the
[1:43:35] scripture go throned not on in I can't
[1:43:40] remember you forgive me anyways we maybe
[1:43:42] we're supposed to close but not not
[1:43:44] thrown not on the throne never mind if
[1:43:48] you remember what I'm saying it's in
[1:43:49] Revelations he's talking about the bride
[1:43:52] Christ not on the throne but in the
[1:43:54] throne in the
[1:43:56] throne man there's so much because it's
[1:43:58] the two have become one so there is no
[1:44:00] there is no judgment for the bride
[1:44:02] that's happening right here amen amen
[1:44:04] all we have left to do you know a little
[1:44:06] squeeze to get us more sincere to get us
[1:44:09] more dedicated however that looks like I
[1:44:11] think we should stop trying to figure
[1:44:12] that out just get more of Christ in us
[1:44:15] it's going to be something brother says
[1:44:17] different things you know right right
[1:44:18] before he completes his cowardly plot

[1:44:23] where he's working on his cowardly plot

[1:45:20] nature build houses build Plant V years
[1:45:23] and we will reap the fruit of it there's
[1:45:26] so much in the word of God and if we can
