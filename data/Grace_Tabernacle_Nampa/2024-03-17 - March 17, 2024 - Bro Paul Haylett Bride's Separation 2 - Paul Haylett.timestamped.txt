[31:26] me
[31:29] amen you know I think of our brother
[31:31] Gary
[31:33] Walker and um how that he was in such a
[31:36] terrible accident years
[31:39] ago there at the accident scene and in
[31:41] the LifeLight helicopter he died several
[31:46] times permanently Brother Gary was a
[31:50] very strong robust young
[31:52] man permanently disfigured his body
[31:55] permanently changed the dire direction
[31:58] of the path of his
[32:01] life and it is so profound to me that
[32:04] when Brother Gary would share his
[32:07] testimony he would make a
[32:09] statement and he would say if you knew
[32:13] what God had in
[32:16] store you would
[32:19] [Music]
[32:22] volunteer sometimes our circumstance
[32:24] seems like
[32:25] it's quite out of control or
[32:29] un
[32:31] ununderstandable we just don't know what
[32:33] step to take next or what direction to
[32:35] go with so many
[32:39] questions but by God's word we have an
[32:43] understanding what he has in store for
[32:46] us
[32:47] let's
[32:51] volunteer let's just let our heart as we
[32:54] sing that song again just let your heart
[32:56] reach out really take a hold to those
[32:59] words speak my Lord I I want to know
[33:03] Lord what it is you want because I'm
[33:05] here to volunteer for whatever you have
[33:07] for me oh
[33:10] speak my
[33:15] Lord my
[33:21] Lord
[33:25] and the
[33:29] speak
[33:39] my speak and I will answer
[33:48] Lord amen good to see each and every one
[33:51] of you this morning
[33:54] amen sister Dorcas good to see your
[33:57] family I
[33:58] I've been praying for you and I I should
[34:00] have made the call but we've been
[34:03] lifting you and your family up before
[34:04] the Lord in prayer and um just uh you
[34:09] know I found just uh you know a little
[34:12] bit of trouble in my own life lately
[34:14] seems like I have a hard time
[34:16] sleeping and um some people say that's
[34:19] what happens when you get old but I know
[34:22] some old folks that's just sleep so well
[34:24] so we don't know how that is but what I
[34:28] have found good of this it's good to
[34:31] look to the bright spot and what I found
[34:34] is is that when I can't sleep I try to
[34:38] practice what I preach and I roll over
[34:40] in bed and bury my face and to start
[34:45] praying and it's a good good thing have
[34:48] enough strength to make it through the
[34:49] day and uh to know that we stand
[34:53] together as a body of Believers not just
[34:55] Grace Tabernacle but the Bride of Jesus
[34:57] Christ all over the world and uh it it
[35:00] is just a wonderful thing and I I'm glad
[35:03] to be associated with each and every one
[35:06] of you and so I would like to just
[35:08] continue from a little bit from last
[35:13] Sunday and um we were preaching about
[35:17] the bride separation thank you all so
[35:19] much beautiful song service preaching
[35:22] about the bride's separation I would
[35:24] just like to touch on that again before
[35:26] we go there I just want to say that
[35:29] communion will be April 7th at 5:00 p.m.
[35:33] and um that's the first Sunday of April
[35:38] and um we certainly want to remember I I
[35:42] didn't hear the sound was turned down in
[35:44] the office but remember brother Trevor
[35:46] sister Carrie spending time brother
[35:48] Trevor Has just felt a real burden uh to
[35:52] to draw closer to his family and so it
[35:56] is something that that I wholeheartedly
[35:59] support because it is in our love right
[36:03] they said how do you know them how would
[36:04] they know them it would be by their love
[36:06] and you know sometimes we we just want
[36:10] to give the word as one giant block and
[36:12] you know just hope somehow they can
[36:14] digest that but you know there is the
[36:18] position that we need to take and that
[36:19] is simply to love them whether you agree
[36:22] or not is
[36:24] irrelevant uh but to love them
[36:26] wholeheartedly from all of your heart
[36:28] mind body and soul sends a message that
[36:32] uh you can't send any other way you
[36:35] might disagree might pass from this life
[36:37] still
[36:38] disagreeing but it is good for us it's
[36:41] good for them amen so remember that
[36:45] brother Adrian sister aah hopefully Lord
[36:48] willing we'll see them um uh around
[36:51] communion time I'm not sure what their
[36:53] schedule was it it varies and he's has a
[36:56] hard time planning but we look forward
[36:58] to seeing them soon also let's turn in
[37:01] our bibles if we would to John the 12th
[37:03] chapter starting with the 23rd verse and
[37:07] uh this we just want to look at this of
[37:11] what is causing the bride to
[37:13] separate now I
[37:17] think we have to be
[37:21] careful how we view
[37:23] things and I'm going to make a statement
[37:26] hopefully shocking to you
[37:28] you but it's not the message that's
[37:31] separating us from the
[37:34] world some people view it like well the
[37:37] message has separated me from my family
[37:39] separated me from Friends old friends
[37:43] Etc but you see it's it's not the
[37:45] message unless you define the message
[37:49] correctly it's actually the holy spirit
[37:52] that is separating us it is not the
[37:55] message because you see in the realm of
[37:58] that while some people would say wo just
[37:59] a second Paul where are you at but you
[38:02] see my brother and sister many people
[38:04] have the message and are not separated
[38:06] from the world right so we can't say
[38:09] that the message itself is the automatic
[38:11] separation from the world many people
[38:14] have bookcases full of the message and
[38:18] are not
[38:19] separated it is the Holy Spirit and the
[38:22] Holy Spirit alone that separates us from
[38:24] the spirit of
[38:25] leoa otherwise we would our bookcase is
[38:28] clear full our cassettes or maybe I'm a
[38:30] little oldfashioned but just cleaning up
[38:33] around our place there if any of you
[38:35] need some cassettes of the message I
[38:37] have about 5,000 of them and um so it
[38:42] isn't a possession that we have these on
[38:44] a bookcase all by date and in order but
[38:48] it's If the message Jesus Christ is in
[38:51] us and there is where separation comes
[38:55] we see uh uh sorry to keep you standing
[38:59] but we see how Through The Years
[39:01] different
[39:02] denominations they disagreed on simple
[39:05] things like
[39:08] television we believe that we should
[39:10] allow it in the homes we have the Holy
[39:13] Ghost we believe it's of the devil don't
[39:16] bother letting the devil in your home
[39:19] they separate but I say this if it
[39:23] sounds judgmental forgive me but let a
[39:26] couple decades go by and those who
[39:29] didn't want the television and those who
[39:31] did want the television are in exactly
[39:34] the same spot
[39:36] spiritually that separation never
[39:39] yielded one single spiritual
[39:46] gain what we've got to do is
[39:49] focus on the separation that takes us
[39:52] and draws us to a higher Place draws us
[39:56] into the presence of God
[39:58] we can preach about this and we can
[40:00] preach about that but if none of that
[40:02] produces a presence that brings us into
[40:05] the presence of God then all we've done
[40:08] is a self-separation
[40:11] and we are not here to have a self
[40:16] separation we are not here to form our
[40:19] own little view that's right we're here
[40:22] to be separated by the moving of the
[40:25] Holy Spirit from those those things that
[40:28] would keep us from making the
[40:31] Rapture John
[40:34] 12:23 and Jesus answered them saying the
[40:37] hour is come that the son of man should
[40:39] be
[40:40] glorified verily verily I say unto you
[40:43] except a corn of wheat fall into the
[40:45] ground and die it abideth alone but if
[40:48] it die it bringeth forth much fruit he
[40:51] that loveth his life shall lose it he
[40:54] that hateth his life in this this world
[40:58] shall keep it into the life eternal If
[41:01] any man serve me let him follow me and
[41:04] where I am there shall also my servant
[41:07] be if any man serve me him will my
[41:12] father
[41:14] honor now is my soul troubled and what
[41:17] shall I say father save me from this
[41:20] hour but for this cause came I un this
[41:23] hour and I just want to emphasize for a
[41:25] moment we won't probably come back and
[41:27] touch on this but sometimes we would
[41:30] have the very words Lord save us from
[41:32] this hour how is it that everywhere we
[41:35] go in this world it's wickedness I
[41:38] remember years ago my first trip to
[41:40] Argentina and it was there that we were
[41:43] going far far south in
[41:46] Patagonia uh where you drive for hours
[41:49] between towns and I I don't know what I
[41:52] was thinking but I thought when we get
[41:54] here it's going to be just this this uh
[41:57] this this normal kind of people because
[41:59] they're so separated from the
[42:04] world but as we come into the town there
[42:07] is this absolutely ginormous dish on a
[42:10] hill out there that was the first
[42:12] premonition we're not as separated as we
[42:15] think we are and when we got to the town
[42:18] I don't want to sound crass or leave a
[42:19] wrong image this morning but some of the
[42:22] very first people we saw a gas station
[42:24] on the edge of this little town Village
[42:26] if you would call it
[42:27] and there they were these teenage girls
[42:29] with hardly any clothes on eating an ice
[42:32] cream bar walking down the side of the
[42:33] street and it struck me it does not
[42:36] matter how far physically you separate
[42:39] from this world if you're not separated
[42:42] in the spirit if you're not separated to
[42:45] Christ that Spirit of leoda will find
[42:49] you and as we traveled through Patagonia
[42:52] we we encountered all kinds of little
[42:54] places we're talking Villages where
[42:56] there's like literally six or seven
[42:58] houses not even a store not a gas
[43:01] station but the spirit of leoda had
[43:04] already arrived and you look at that and
[43:07] realize it takes more than just a
[43:10] pulling
[43:11] back distancing yourself from there has
[43:15] to be something that fills that space
[43:20] something that prepares us to stand in
[43:23] the test of time and as we look at this
[43:26] I say father father save me from this
[43:28] hour but God called you Saints to this
[43:30] hour amen but this cuse come mind to the
[43:34] uh to this hour I say we can take that
[43:37] same words that Jesus spoke and say it
[43:39] was for this hour that we were called to
[43:42] be here in this present world not
[43:46] looking to a time oh if we could go back
[43:49] a certain time I could have been an
[43:50] overcomer there not to look over here if
[43:53] I had lived in this place or that place
[43:55] but wherever God has placed us we were
[43:58] called to this hour and we will
[44:03] overcome father glorify thy name then
[44:06] came there a voice from Heaven saying I
[44:08] have both glorified it and will glorify
[44:11] it again the people there that stood by
[44:14] and heard it said that it thundered
[44:17] others said an angel spoke to him Jesus
[44:20] answered and said this voice came not
[44:24] because of me but for your sakes
[44:28] amen now we look at this my brother and
[44:31] sister the Judgment of this world now
[44:35] shall the prince of this world be cast
[44:38] out very clearly showing who's the God
[44:41] of this evil
[44:42] age and I if I be lifted up from the
[44:45] earth will draw all men unto me Heavenly
[44:50] Father we ask for a blessing of your
[44:51] word today speak to our hearts Lord for
[44:55] every shortcoming every weakness Lord
[44:58] every doubt every fear father we ask you
[45:00] to come wash us father forgive us
[45:04] strengthen us father Lord that we would
[45:06] not stand here in this hour an anxious
[45:09] people but a people standing with a
[45:11] quiet confidence of who we are in you we
[45:15] ask you to bless this time in the name
[45:17] of Jesus Christ amen you may be
[45:21] seated now as these
[45:24] words and I if I be lifted up from the
[45:27] Earth will draw all men unto me was
[45:29] Jesus speaking concerning his death and
[45:32] in that realm my brother and sister we
[45:34] can look and realize just how his death
[45:37] has impacted our lives and so we see
[45:41] that we're living in a Time certainly
[45:44] you know it's kind of confusing phrases
[45:47] that are often used in the world because
[45:49] if you was to go and listen to many a
[45:52] Pentecostal not all but many a
[45:54] Pentecostal church today they would be
[45:56] using using vocabulary that is not that
[45:59] far removed from what we speak it is not
[46:02] a whole entirely different word it is
[46:05] not as though the phrases that we would
[46:07] use would be what would separate us and
[46:10] so it's time uh that we stand in this
[46:14] day uh and uh it's time for us to
[46:17] respond to the voice amen amen it is
[46:20] time now this is not some figurative
[46:22] thing my brother and sister but I'm
[46:24] talking about the still Small Voice that
[46:26] speaks to you in the Midnight Hour the
[46:28] still Small Voice that speaks to you in
[46:31] your time of anxiety and dismay in the
[46:34] times of struggle the times that we
[46:37] don't know what to do or what decision
[46:39] or path to take this is a still Small
[46:41] Voice and while this would be used
[46:44] against me in a hall of critics my
[46:45] brother and sister that voice does not
[46:48] have to come off of a tape that's right
[46:50] amen that voice is God speaking to you
[46:53] directly amen if it comes from a tape I
[46:56] don't care can't tell you how many times
[46:58] you hear something that just strikes you
[47:00] at exactly the right time and I say
[47:03] thank you Lord but if you've got a
[47:05] prayer life you're going to be hearing
[47:06] from God amen amen if you don't have a
[47:09] prayer life you'll be wondering what are
[47:11] they talking about that's why we must
[47:14] have a prayer life that's why we must be
[47:17] able to come and sit down as it were in
[47:21] your way your fashion whatever it might
[47:23] be but God still speaking his word to
[47:27] his bride amen and until he comes and
[47:30] takes that bride's home his voice will
[47:32] not be silenced it won't matter if you
[47:35] have no electricity the voice is there
[47:37] it don't matter whether you even have a
[47:40] time might come they'll take your Bible
[47:42] from you the voice will still be there
[47:46] amen because this is not something as
[47:48] the prophet said not a mechanical device
[47:51] this is a relationship between you and
[47:54] Jesus Christ amen and he still speak
[47:56] speaking amen amen sir you know Jesus
[48:00] said you know in verse 30 this voice
[48:02] came not because of me he didn't have
[48:05] any need to speak the word he was the
[48:07] word he didn't need to hear himself
[48:10] speak it he didn't need it repeated he's
[48:13] the one who authored it he knew what it
[48:15] said amen he knows what it says he says
[48:19] it didn't come because of me but for
[48:21] your sake Can someone say thank you Lord
[48:23] that you were thinking of me amen I was
[48:26] reading read in the Bible the other day
[48:28] and I wished I I just had picked it up
[48:30] and was reading and and I honestly
[48:32] couldn't tell you where I found this but
[48:35] you know I looked down in the scripture
[48:37] there and it was speaking I believe it
[48:39] was psalmist David but I'm not sure and
[48:41] speaking and it says because he loveth
[48:45] my soul oh my brother and sister how
[48:47] beautiful that is that God would love
[48:50] our souls today he would love us so much
[48:53] that he would fulfill every word and
[48:56] bring it to house in a fashion that
[48:58] would be that we could grasp it we could
[49:01] hold on to it we could claim it and we
[49:04] could live it amen he didn't just speak
[49:07] words that we would stand and say well
[49:09] he said he said but it comes down to the
[49:12] time we'll speak amen the bride has a
[49:15] voice amen amen and so he said this
[49:19] voice come not because of me but for
[49:21] your sake and I say in this day this
[49:24] voice is still speaking
[49:27] amen it's speaking to this Brine and it
[49:30] come for my sake for your sake you see
[49:34] the prophet of God talking about the
[49:36] church now some people would get
[49:38] confused when he when he talks about the
[49:40] church you know and how that God is
[49:42] calling us out of the church he's
[49:45] calling a church out of
[49:47] denomination and he's calling a people
[49:49] out of the
[49:50] church and then he says we are the
[49:53] church and some people get confused as
[49:56] though are we called out is there
[49:58] another calling out fixing to come to
[50:01] draw us then out of this other church
[50:04] but my brother and sister the word as
[50:06] brother bradam speaks it and reminds us
[50:08] so often the word church means called
[50:11] out amen and so a calling and a calling
[50:15] and a calling is not we're going to have
[50:17] another church age it's not we're going
[50:18] to have some great move of restoration
[50:21] that is going to go through the body of
[50:23] Believers but my brother and sister he's
[50:25] calling a people out of the church for
[50:28] his name's sake and in that when he's
[50:30] calling there's going to be a people
[50:32] that hear that voice now my brother and
[50:35] sister as we see right here some thought
[50:37] that it you know it was uh uh some
[50:40] thought it was uh uh um just lost my
[50:43] thought some thought I got that thought
[50:48] amen now see some said well you know we
[50:51] we hear this did you hear this uh um
[50:54] this
[50:55] voice
[50:57] clapping of
[50:58] Thunder some say an angels
[51:01] spoke they were all
[51:04] right word everyone was right but they
[51:07] didn't have the interpretation of it
[51:08] that's right they couldn't come to the
[51:11] place where they fully grasp what was
[51:14] spoken right and how it applied to them
[51:17] now I want to ask you is God not
[51:19] speaking in this hour amen The Voice
[51:22] thundered amen it was as a voice that
[51:24] Angels spoke my brother and sister but
[51:27] we now have interpretation we now have
[51:30] revelation we now have understanding
[51:32] what was he doing he wasn't talking to
[51:34] the church nominal he was speaking to
[51:36] the bride of Christ he was calling a
[51:38] bride out of another group bringing her
[51:41] a little bit higher and the word of God
[51:43] every word the prophet of God spoke my
[51:45] brother and sister is from the Throne of
[51:47] God it is not man speaking it's God
[51:51] speaking amen now you know I I I like to
[51:54] joke a little bit this way not uh
[51:58] disrespect uh I I used to really be
[52:00] hardlining on this uh you know that not
[52:03] every thought brother random had was
[52:05] absolute
[52:07] solidified at that time I only drove
[52:10] cilet and I was like nope he drove a
[52:12] Ford he didn't have it all right but now
[52:14] I drive a Ford I'm starting to see it a
[52:16] little bit that way the
[52:22] Lord you see we got to keep balance in
[52:24] our
[52:25] life amen right
[52:28] [Music]
[52:32] Hallelujah so we look my brother and
[52:34] sister that God cares so much for you
[52:37] and I that he
[52:40] spoke and he brought this about that we
[52:43] could come and hear this
[52:46] voice to become that called out people
[52:49] that's right see it's not enough that he
[52:51] spoke about being a called out people
[52:53] that there would be but it is that we
[52:56] come to the position today to recognize
[52:58] we are that called out people we were
[53:02] the one called out of the church be
[53:05] called into position as not member or
[53:08] Associates or this or that but to
[53:10] identify as bride amen and I can tell
[53:13] you today my brother and sister the word
[53:15] of God our Lord Jesus Christ did not die
[53:18] in vain there is a people that is called
[53:22] out that is called out for his name's
[53:24] sake and when we are called into his
[53:27] presence you cannot be in that presence
[53:30] and remain the same that's right God is
[53:32] moving us amen now brother Brown says
[53:36] here in the sermon amen recognizing your
[53:40] day and its message he said through
[53:42] Hosea I have
[53:44] hued now watch Israel he's talking to I
[53:48] have hued or other words I have chopped
[53:51] and chopped them out through the
[53:53] prophets that's how God does his people
[53:56] he he Cho them out from the rest of the
[53:59] Nations now the word says this message
[54:01] is going to go to Every Nation Kindred
[54:04] and tongue so it's not talking about
[54:07] some Nation being excluded my brother
[54:09] and sister you take certain continents
[54:11] Africa to be an example you know you can
[54:15] you can uh land sister Jerry and I a few
[54:18] years ago flying to to South Africa we
[54:21] landed in snagle and the plane refueled
[54:24] let off passengers and um you know you
[54:27] think okay we're in Africa praise God it
[54:30] was still I don't know five more
[54:32] hours flying from sagol to South Africa
[54:37] you know it it it is a continent my
[54:40] brother and sister that is enormous and
[54:43] so God didn't say you know what I'm only
[54:45] going to drop the word over here and
[54:46] ignore a certain continent he said every
[54:50] nation Kindred and tongue he diced up
[54:53] the continents and made it specific to
[54:56] those people to their life to their need
[54:59] to their you might say
[55:02] tradition you know the vision books
[55:05] brother Barry they're Printing and they
[55:08] felt led of God they're now printing in
[55:10] very specific uh
[55:13] languages and some of these people have
[55:16] never had the message they had the
[55:19] message preached to them but never had
[55:21] the message in printed form until now
[55:24] amen now it doesn't say until every
[55:27] nation has a printed message book it
[55:30] says until the word has come but I tell
[55:33] you how much we Rejoice that we have it
[55:36] in English
[55:38] amen we Rejoice that we can just pick it
[55:40] up or push play and we can hear God's
[55:44] voice to this generation how much
[55:47] difference that makes so as we look at
[55:49] this God is hewing he says Chom them out
[55:52] from the rest of the Nations what by his
[55:55] two-edged sword his word he chopped them
[56:00] his Nation from the Nations he chopped
[56:03] his Nation from the Nations by the
[56:05] prophets his Vindicated word so has he
[56:08] chopped his bride from the denominations
[56:11] by his word promised by Malachi 4 in the
[56:14] last day chopped out his bride hewed her
[56:18] from the rest of the churches hewed out
[56:20] his bride amen and we'll even find
[56:23] brother and sister I hope this is not
[56:24] controversial to you I don't believe it
[56:26] should be but you'll find that Malachi 4
[56:29] is actually addressing the
[56:33] people amen we stand on that I believe
[56:37] in Malachi 4 I'll Stand wholeheartedly
[56:39] behind it but we need to recognize God
[56:42] was actually speaking to the people
[56:45] behold I send you amen now he wouldn't
[56:49] say that if he's speaking to the prophet
[56:51] to the
[56:53] age behold I send you no
[56:56] he's the one that's being sent amen
[56:59] behold I send you Elijah the prophet and
[57:04] so we sit here today and realize how
[57:06] much God loves your soul amen coming
[57:10] down to the end of time coming down to
[57:12] the most deceitful age coming down to
[57:14] the time of the calling away of the
[57:17] bride of Christ God with a certainty
[57:19] said I'm going to make sure this works
[57:22] according to my word take it back
[57:24] through Zachariah take it into
[57:26] Ecclesiastes take it back to even
[57:28] Leviticus and you look at this that God
[57:31] gave very specific promises how he was
[57:33] going to work and how it was going to
[57:35] come to pass and what must take place to
[57:38] put you and I in rapturing condition
[57:41] amen it's not just having a message is
[57:43] not going to put us in rapturing
[57:44] condition it is a bride just as the
[57:47] story of the Rancher and the little girl
[57:49] she had preparation to do coming to the
[57:52] coming of her future husband only
[57:56] problem is is he had already asked her
[57:58] to marry him and she had already said
[58:00] yes so in God's eyes they were one
[58:02] that's right so he wasn't just coming to
[58:04] find a wife and hoping she was still
[58:06] there he was coming to get that other
[58:09] portion of himself and the prophet of
[58:11] God said that Jesus Christ is returning
[58:13] in this last day to get the other part
[58:17] of himself amen redeeming collecting up
[58:21] taking possession of something that was
[58:24] already him amen amen not going to
[58:27] become him but is already him amen
[58:32] hallelujah I'm so glad what is it God
[58:34] doing you ever felt a kind of what you
[58:36] might call Birth pains
[58:39] yes ever feel like you didn't do
[58:41] something quite right and it just comes
[58:43] to a a moment in your life and it just
[58:45] seems to be kind of a a dramatic moment
[58:48] it comes a moment of Crisis almost I
[58:51] want you to know that was just God
[58:53] hewing you out amen it was just God
[58:56] carving away everything that shouldn't
[58:58] be there my brother and sister I tell
[59:01] you what we want God to put it all you
[59:04] know uh cream and all kinds of coffee
[59:07] and all kinds of roses and all kinds of
[59:09] flowy whatever with a few little sugary
[59:12] things throw it in God's got a two-edged
[59:15] sword of the word amen and the prophet
[59:18] of God said he's heing you out amen and
[59:22] sometimes the hewing we take too
[59:24] personal yes sir we should be lifting
[59:27] our hand and saying Thank You Lord you
[59:29] cut away that oh thank you Lord I can
[59:32] live without that thank you Lord as it's
[59:34] cutting us away but instead the human
[59:37] nature gets in there and we are like oh
[59:39] why Lord why am I going through this
[59:41] struggle why am I going through this
[59:43] trial why are we in this moments of
[59:45] indecision why Lord and we should have
[59:48] our hands up saying Thank You Lord
[59:50] You're hewing it away from me everything
[59:52] that's not necessary in my life
[59:54] everything that's hindering me me
[59:56] everything that's kept my faith low
[59:58] everything that's brought an anxiety or
[1:00:00] a fear in my life cut it away Lord
[1:00:03] that's right Hallelujah that's
[1:00:06] right but we kind of like
[1:00:09] ourselves we do a lot to protect
[1:00:12] ourselves we do a lot to comfort
[1:00:16] ourselves well we won't go into it this
[1:00:18] morning but go look what the word of God
[1:00:20] says true Comfort is amen true Comfort
[1:00:23] only comes from being completely in
[1:00:25] Christ amen that's right now as we look
[1:00:27] at
[1:00:29] this I don't remember how I I messed up
[1:00:33] my notes and I don't remember what I did
[1:00:34] I had some arrows drawn for the brothers
[1:00:36] to follow because I wrote things down in
[1:00:38] the wrong order but I think we're okay
[1:00:40] Hebrews

[1:00:45] 16 now I'm going to slow down right here
[1:00:48] because I want to make sure everybody
[1:00:49] catches this if therefore Perfection
[1:00:52] were by the levitical priesthood for
[1:00:56] under it the people receive the law so
[1:01:00] law directly connected to the levitical
[1:01:04] priesthood what further need was there
[1:01:06] that another priest should rise after
[1:01:09] the order of
[1:01:11] MDC and not be called after the order of
[1:01:16] Aaron that's so this is where the people
[1:01:20] who can't catch the
[1:01:23] transition between the old Covenant the
[1:01:26] New Covenant this is where they're doing
[1:01:28] because they're missing this changing of
[1:01:31] the order of priesthood that's
[1:01:34] right and you know you and I in our
[1:01:36] natural life or spiritual life I guess I
[1:01:38] should say we have to have a
[1:01:41] changing of the
[1:01:47] priesthood Baptists used to say years
[1:01:50] ago once a Baptist always a
[1:01:53] Baptist God come along and says once a
[1:01:57] Baptist now under a new
[1:02:01] priesthood we can put whatever religion
[1:02:03] that we came from whatever our
[1:02:05] background our childhood or whatever
[1:02:07] might be it might even we could apply
[1:02:10] this right in the message that you see
[1:02:13] you can be in the message without the
[1:02:14] Holy Ghost and still call yourself a
[1:02:16] Believer but you're under a new
[1:02:19] priesthood when you have the Holy Ghost
[1:02:22] and you are in the message you're under
[1:02:24] a new priesthood now amen amen you're
[1:02:26] under new guidance and New Direction
[1:02:28] we're not looking to the old order we're
[1:02:30] looking to the New Order that God has
[1:02:33] put in place are you with me amen so we
[1:02:36] look at this now uh if the priesthood
[1:02:39] for the priesthood being changed there
[1:02:41] is made of a necessity a change also of
[1:02:45] the
[1:02:46] law you wonder how we get from law to
[1:02:50] grace and grace not to disgrace but
[1:02:53] Grace to a deeper consecration to the
[1:02:55] word word is because there has been a
[1:02:58] change and if we don't see the change
[1:03:01] don't understand the change don't have a
[1:03:04] revelation of the change then we
[1:03:06] actually just change from a book that
[1:03:09] says Baptist to a book that says this to
[1:03:12] a book that says that to a book that
[1:03:13] says message
[1:03:15] believer amen but we're not looking for
[1:03:17] a changing of the title of our book amen
[1:03:20] we're looking for looking for a change
[1:03:22] of the order that's right and when we
[1:03:24] come into a change of the order this
[1:03:26] message what the prophet say when you
[1:03:28] get the Holy Ghost I'm paraphrasing when
[1:03:30] you get the Holy Ghost this Bible will
[1:03:33] become a brand new book to you amen no
[1:03:37] longer of I can and I can't or I should
[1:03:40] or I shouldn't but it comes a book of
[1:03:42] Revelation that this is a story that my
[1:03:45] husband wrote to me this is my love
[1:03:48] letter this is my letter that gives me
[1:03:51] uh uh consolation and and in my sorrow
[1:03:54] gives me strength and in my my
[1:03:55] loneliness gives me an
[1:03:57] answer the change of the
[1:04:00] order amen the change also of the law
[1:04:04] for he of whom these things was spoken
[1:04:07] pertaineth to another
[1:04:14] tribe Hallelujah you know that went
[1:04:17] through the that went through the world
[1:04:19] here sometime back I don't know my
[1:04:22] daughter chrisen sometimes uses that
[1:04:24] she'll call the grandchildren they'll be
[1:04:26] in the basement or something we're going
[1:04:28] home come on
[1:04:35] tribe I just can't help myself I'm sorry
[1:04:38] my grandkids are a bunch of wild Indians
[1:04:40] so tribe is probably very
[1:04:43] accurate but my brother and sister we
[1:04:46] are a whole different tribe yes sir we
[1:04:49] are not just the old people with a
[1:04:51] slight conversion we're not the old
[1:04:53] people with just a new book book to
[1:04:56] follow we are a complete new tribe
[1:05:02] that's right a complete new
[1:05:05] people new creature in Christ
[1:05:14] Jesus amen of which no man gave
[1:05:17] attendance at the altar yeah for it is
[1:05:21] evident that our Lord sprang out of
[1:05:23] Judah of which tribe Moses spake nothing
[1:05:27] concerning priesthood
[1:05:30] amen amazing it's almost like there's
[1:05:33] been a
[1:05:36] takeover almost like you know a
[1:05:39] Breaking of the order that God had put
[1:05:42] in but you see God was going to show us
[1:05:45] my brother and sister now look we spoke
[1:05:47] the other day mentioned I don't remember
[1:05:49] when Wednesday Sunday God does work in
[1:05:51] Bloodlines and I say thank you Lord amen
[1:05:55] but you know know it comes down to
[1:05:57] people tend and especially Jews uh and
[1:06:00] and other religions but it's crept into
[1:06:03] our
[1:06:03] world you don't even know what I'm
[1:06:05] talking about because I've kept you in
[1:06:07] the blind all this
[1:06:09] point
[1:06:11] succession not conversion right
[1:06:17] succession our
[1:06:19] family has been in the message for 60 70
[1:06:25] years that's
[1:06:27] it now I'm not rude enough to do this
[1:06:29] but there's times I want to ask them and
[1:06:31] how many of them are
[1:06:33] saved how many of them have the Holy
[1:06:36] Ghost just walking in the door of a
[1:06:38] message Church my brother and sister
[1:06:40] does not make you the message that's
[1:06:45] right it is conversion that's right but
[1:06:49] if we look at it from succession our
[1:06:51] family is a levitical family here and we
[1:06:55] have been priest priest priest priest
[1:06:58] priest and we get all the way up to
[1:07:00] Eli and Eli doesn't want his kids to go
[1:07:04] out and have to struggle in the world so
[1:07:06] Eli turns a blind eye and his sons who
[1:07:10] are born in the
[1:07:12] correct
[1:07:14] lineage we won't even talk about what
[1:07:17] they did around the
[1:07:20] temple
[1:07:21] Behavior so unsing to being
[1:07:26] a
[1:07:30] Levi what broke
[1:07:33] that
[1:07:36] why because it all comes down to
[1:07:40] relationship does not put us because
[1:07:42] we're born in a bloodline and our great
[1:07:46] grandparents and our grandparents and my
[1:07:48] parents and myself and my children and
[1:07:50] my grandchildren we were born in the
[1:07:53] message was the message born in you yeah
[1:07:56] that's it see there's there's the key
[1:07:58] right there that message has got to be
[1:08:00] born in US amen amen so we see that
[1:08:04] there's now coming a changing of the
[1:08:07] order Moses spoke nothing of this for
[1:08:10] the priesthood and it's far more
[1:08:12] evidence that after the similitude of
[1:08:14] MDC there ariseth another priest amen so
[1:08:18] God says I'm going to put a priest that
[1:08:21] you truly can count on in all things
[1:08:23] there arises another other priest who is
[1:08:27] made not after the law of carnal
[1:08:30] commandment but after the power of
[1:08:32] endless life amen not that it was I was
[1:08:35] born in this family but the power that
[1:08:38] was in that came and now has changed me
[1:08:42] it wouldn't matter if you are born into
[1:08:44] a message family I say thank you Lord
[1:08:47] that you are or have been but my brother
[1:08:50] and sister the power of endless life
[1:08:52] doesn't come through carnal family it
[1:08:55] doesn't come through carnal descendants
[1:08:57] it doesn't come through a carnal lineage
[1:09:00] but the power of an endless life comes
[1:09:02] from this new priest we identify as our
[1:09:05] Lord Jesus Christ and he come and when
[1:09:08] that power comes under that anointing of
[1:09:10] that priesthood there is something
[1:09:13] different my brother and sister the
[1:09:15] flesh passes but the soul has Eternal
[1:09:18] endless life amen and that's what we're
[1:09:20] looking
[1:09:23] for if it was just Holiness my brother
[1:09:26] and sister there's churches that are
[1:09:27] still Holiness that don't have a
[1:09:29] standard like you
[1:09:33] do we could just go over there and live
[1:09:35] nice and easy and comfortable under that
[1:09:37] standard if it was just Holiness that's
[1:09:41] amen it was just believing in prophets
[1:09:43] there's religions we could go to that
[1:09:45] would be easier on the flesh to live in
[1:09:49] and believe in a prophet that's it
[1:09:53] certainly but where you going to find
[1:09:54] the power of endless life that's it
[1:09:57] there's only one place you find that and
[1:09:59] that's right here in the word and the
[1:10:01] word said that I'm not only with you I
[1:10:04] am in you and not just for a season but
[1:10:08] to the Finish to the end there's where
[1:10:11] we come to a separation it is not my
[1:10:15] brother and sister now I hope you catch
[1:10:17] this in this realm this is not why I say
[1:10:19] this is not the message that does that
[1:10:22] it's not because we were born and raised
[1:10:24] in a message Church that does the
[1:10:26] separating my brother and sister it is
[1:10:29] the power of endless life that does the
[1:10:31] separating that's what pulls us and cuts
[1:10:34] away everything that's not right is the
[1:10:37] power that's in the word of endless life
[1:10:42] amen and I believe if we ever really
[1:10:44] truly could just get ourselves wrapped
[1:10:47] around everything that the prophet spoke
[1:10:49] that would be a foregone conclusion we
[1:10:52] wouldn't be sitting here even talking or
[1:10:54] debating or doing whatever we'd
[1:10:56] recognize that the very word he was
[1:10:59] speaking was to bring us to the place
[1:11:01] that we recognize there's a power in our
[1:11:04] midst and it's not just the signs and
[1:11:06] wonders speaking in tongues Miracle kind
[1:11:09] of power but the power that changes us
[1:11:11] converts us and moves us into endless
[1:11:14] life oh that's what I want is endless
[1:11:17] life
[1:11:19] hallelujah amen amen so look at
[1:11:23] this power of endless life
[1:11:26] You Were
[1:11:27] Made In His Image yes
[1:11:31] sir flesh of his flesh bone of his bone
[1:11:36] what does that say about the bride of
[1:11:38] Christ She's Got The Power of endless
[1:11:41] life in her and if that power is in
[1:11:44] there my brother and sister it's not
[1:11:46] such a low wattage power that it won't
[1:11:48] show but this is a power that binded
[1:11:51] Saul or Paul as it were on the road amen
[1:11:55] this is a power that is so bright my
[1:11:57] brother and sister that you could see
[1:11:59] how that God moving in places and times
[1:12:03] and circumstances made himself known in
[1:12:06] such a powerful way this is not just a
[1:12:10] message this is not just a word that
[1:12:12] somebody could come and by uh
[1:12:15] understanding or theological
[1:12:17] understanding or intellect Gras and say
[1:12:19] oh I I see that perfectly this is a
[1:12:22] power that changes lives amen this is a
[1:12:26] power my brother and sister that heals
[1:12:28] bodies that are sick this is a power
[1:12:30] that delivers from unbelief these are
[1:12:33] powers my brother and sister that this
[1:12:35] world believes in but can't quite seem
[1:12:39] to grasp that's it amen I'm sorry to be
[1:12:42] so blunt but you know in some of my
[1:12:44] looking I'm just going to speak it out
[1:12:46] there's a well I won't I'll camouflage
[1:12:48] it a little bit there's a preacher
[1:12:50] that's just kind of pretty far out there
[1:12:53] I I don't know if I could ever show up
[1:12:56] in public in ripped jeans and a muscle
[1:13:00] shirt first off I would have to I think
[1:13:03] Jerry threw all the ripped jeans
[1:13:05] away and I wouldn't look very good in a
[1:13:07] muscle
[1:13:09] shirt but here's a man I decide not to
[1:13:11] name him he makes
[1:13:14] statements over his pulpit and the rest
[1:13:18] of the religious World criticizes
[1:13:22] him do I say he's right no because I
[1:13:26] don't believe any man with a real Holy
[1:13:28] Ghost presence around him is going to
[1:13:29] show up in a Pulpit and ripped jeans in
[1:13:32] a muscle
[1:13:34] shirt put their hair in the fan you
[1:13:37] know get in the
[1:13:39] shower wash their hair take a fan no
[1:13:43] they don't blow it they suck it so it's
[1:13:45] all standing straight up and pointed
[1:13:46] every which direction and then they tefl
[1:13:49] on it so no matter what they do that day
[1:13:52] it stays just like that
[1:13:57] but they make
[1:13:59] statements and the rest of the religious
[1:14:01] World criticizes
[1:14:05] them but the statement's
[1:14:10] true the statements are true recently
[1:14:14] this man made a statement we're little
[1:14:17] gods and the internet erupted about what
[1:14:20] kind of a wicked evil man is this but my
[1:14:24] brother and sister it shows that the
[1:14:25] religious world doesn't even know their
[1:14:26] own Bible that's right because our own
[1:14:29] Bible says that we're little Gods that's
[1:14:32] right and it has to be so because we're
[1:14:34] crafted and made in him and molded In
[1:14:38] His Image and he is God so therefore
[1:14:41] we're crafted and molded in him his
[1:14:43] image we have to be of the same God
[1:14:47] material amen amen or either we weren't
[1:14:51] crafted are you with
[1:14:54] me you see what's happened my brother
[1:14:57] and sister is this power of endless life
[1:15:00] didn't come in the way that they thought
[1:15:02] it would it didn't come in the
[1:15:03] demonstration that they thought it would
[1:15:06] but it came as a voice it came in this
[1:15:09] day as a voice there they're looking for
[1:15:11] this written word here and it must come
[1:15:14] to fit their interpretation of the
[1:15:16] written word but the voice was standing
[1:15:19] uh talking about our Lord Jesus Christ
[1:15:20] standing there in their midst
[1:15:23] interpreting the word for them them and
[1:15:25] they said that's not what it means
[1:15:28] that's not what it means well I would
[1:15:31] think the one who wrote the Bible would
[1:15:34] know what it
[1:15:35] means I would think that one who
[1:15:41] spoke knew what he was speaking
[1:15:45] right
[1:15:48] right endless life has a
[1:15:52] voice yes sir amen someone's going to
[1:15:55] fulfill that amen that's right here am I
[1:15:58] Lord send me amen amen hallelujah
[1:16:02] somebody's going to have a voice in this
[1:16:03] age here am I Lord send me I I'm must
[1:16:07] I'm terrified you know people say oh
[1:16:09] brother Paul you know you do pretty good
[1:16:11] in the Pulpit or whatever well my
[1:16:13] brother and sister this is Anointed
[1:16:14] speaking when you get out and do the
[1:16:16] nuts and Bol stuff and it's not so
[1:16:18] anointed that's when I freeze up you can
[1:16:20] hear my rusty joints and you're like oh
[1:16:22] what do I say now Lord but the words
[1:16:24] said think not of what you're going to
[1:16:27] say I'll put the words in your mouth
[1:16:29] I'll show you what to say but the only
[1:16:32] way that works is that we have
[1:16:35] submitted we have just completely come
[1:16:37] and said Lord I have nothing to say I
[1:16:40] know not what to say but Lord you've got
[1:16:43] something to say Let It Be I'm here Lord
[1:16:46] use me amen Use Me Lord just don't let
[1:16:49] it be my words don't let it be my
[1:16:51] thoughts let it be your thoughts that's
[1:16:54] right
[1:16:55] hallelujah amen cuz endless life eternal
[1:16:59] life has a voice
[1:17:01] amen
[1:17:03] someone is going to be eternally
[1:17:06] separated that's exactly right amen now
[1:17:09] that's a leading question or statement
[1:17:12] because you can take this over in this
[1:17:13] negative realm or you can take it over
[1:17:15] here in this positive
[1:17:17] realm someone's going to be eternally
[1:17:20] separated from unbelief that's exactly
[1:17:23] right amen we can talk about what's
[1:17:25] wrong all we want we can oh they this
[1:17:28] and they that and and the world's going
[1:17:30] here and the denomination's going there
[1:17:32] we're not here for them my brother and
[1:17:34] sister we're here for those that are
[1:17:36] anointed with the word of eternal life
[1:17:39] amen Anointed with that life that is
[1:17:42] there and they're going to be eternally
[1:17:44] separated from unbelief amen amen
[1:17:46] hallelujah that's right
[1:17:50] yes this where I think I confused myself
[1:17:57] I think we're on the right track
[1:18:00] brother if not Lord will correct it all
[1:18:03] in
[1:18:07] the seven Church
[1:18:09] ages I'll just be honest with you I had
[1:18:11] a little struggle put this before this
[1:18:13] point or after this point this point and
[1:18:15] I think I had one set of notes it has it
[1:18:17] before and the other set has it after so
[1:18:20] Shuffle the papers
[1:18:22] and now brother Brown says here in the
[1:18:25] resume of the ages not for one moment do
[1:18:27] I bring a message to the people that
[1:18:29] they may follow me that's exactly right
[1:18:32] not for one moment no sir he never
[1:18:35] stepped out and said I'll get a people
[1:18:36] to follow me no
[1:18:38] sir
[1:18:41] remember there's a voice that's right
[1:18:44] that's right or join my church or start
[1:18:47] some fellowship and organization I've
[1:18:49] never done that and will not do that now
[1:18:52] I have no interest in those things but I
[1:18:54] do have an interest in the things of God
[1:18:57] and people and if I can accomplish just
[1:19:00] one thing I will be satisfied and that
[1:19:02] one thing is to see established a true
[1:19:05] spiritual relationship between God and
[1:19:08] Men wherein men become New Creations in
[1:19:12] Christ filled with his spirit and live
[1:19:14] according to his will I would invite
[1:19:18] plead and warn all to hear his voice at
[1:19:21] this time and yield your lives
[1:19:23] completely to him even as I trust in my
[1:19:26] heart that I have given my all to him so
[1:19:30] here's a prophet telling me look I'm
[1:19:32] trusting that I have went down the right
[1:19:35] path have said and done the right things
[1:19:38] my brother and sister and he's
[1:19:39] encouraging you and I go ahead my
[1:19:42] brother and sister now look at this I
[1:19:44] don't know I think I cut it out of my
[1:19:45] sermon because I decided it' be too long
[1:19:47] but but look at
[1:19:51] Peter they could have just sat in the
[1:19:53] boat and said now according to
[1:19:56] science the weight of matter and the
[1:19:58] density of
[1:20:00] water and cohesion of
[1:20:05] molecules there's no physical
[1:20:08] way I can walk on
[1:20:12] water Jesus you have to understand
[1:20:15] science
[1:20:18] says but there was something in Peter
[1:20:21] that longed to see faith something in
[1:20:25] Peter that longed to be back in the
[1:20:27] presence of the Lord Jesus Christ and he
[1:20:30] defied every scientific explanation
[1:20:34] every kind of idea look they were
[1:20:36] fishermen they knew you jump out of the
[1:20:38] boat you go under he knew that but
[1:20:41] something had changed the composition of
[1:20:44] his thought and he just said Jesus bid
[1:20:48] me
[1:20:49] come I would like to lift my hand this
[1:20:52] morning Lord bid me come that's it don't
[1:20:57] let my thinking of what the spirit of
[1:21:00] leoda my own failure my own anxiety my
[1:21:03] own fear my own unaccomplished stop me
[1:21:07] Lord bid me to come and I'll step out of
[1:21:10] my position and I don't care Lord cuz
[1:21:12] I'm in your presence what my mind my
[1:21:15] body anything else would declare I'm
[1:21:17] going to
[1:21:18] come am but look how quick we are I I
[1:21:22] don't say this to have any fight to it
[1:21:25] but look how quick we
[1:21:27] are wonderful
[1:21:30] service and we can't even make it from
[1:21:33] Sunday to Wednesday and Wednesday to
[1:21:36] Sunday right but we're
[1:21:40] already
[1:21:42] sinking that's it we're already
[1:21:46] settling we've already had anxieties and
[1:21:49] fears and temper tantrums and this and
[1:21:51] that and the others I don't say that
[1:21:53] judgmental
[1:21:55] I'm just telling you we're human and so
[1:21:58] was
[1:22:01] Peter Jesus rebuke Peter for his
[1:22:04] unbelief and if he's standing here this
[1:22:06] morning he would rebuke you and I for
[1:22:08] our
[1:22:10] unbelief but he never told Peter go
[1:22:13] away in fact he did quite the opposite
[1:22:16] he reached out a
[1:22:18] hand Come Peter amen once again if you
[1:22:22] don't mind phrasing it this way Peter's
[1:22:23] in the game
[1:22:25] amen his doubts and fears had removed
[1:22:27] him like I can't do this what was I
[1:22:30] thinking crying out in his fear and when
[1:22:33] Jesus bid him to come Peter come and I I
[1:22:36] I want to say this in a positive sense
[1:22:38] to you church he bids us come many many
[1:22:44] many many times a
[1:22:47] day when we can't walk he's bidding us
[1:22:51] to come that's when we can't have the
[1:22:54] strength for the next step he's bidding
[1:22:56] us to come do you see how we're getting
[1:22:58] closer to him it's not what we've done
[1:23:02] but it's his bidding that's it come come
[1:23:07] come a loving
[1:23:09] patient God who loves our souls amen
[1:23:14] amen isn't that incredible amen isn't
[1:23:16] that beautiful amen I'm so glad he loves
[1:23:18] my soul that's amen
[1:23:23] now

[1:23:31] here where in men become New Creations
[1:23:33] filled with his Spirit live according to
[1:23:35] his word I would invite plead and warn
[1:23:37] all to hear his voice at this time yield
[1:23:38] your lives completely to him even as I
[1:23:41] trust in my heart that I have given my
[1:23:43] all to him God bless you and may his
[1:23:45] coming Rejoice your heart oh my my
[1:23:49] brother and sister what is this here is
[1:23:51] a separation time that's it a time for
[1:23:54] us to come and we're so worried now
[1:23:57] don't misunderstand me on this I I don't
[1:23:59] believe we ought to flirt with the world
[1:24:01] but we're so worried about the spirit of
[1:24:03] the world out there that we're failing
[1:24:06] and F falling in our own fears and
[1:24:09] anxieties we we're we're wondering am I
[1:24:11] really called you know as this and that
[1:24:14] my brother and sister you don't need to
[1:24:15] worry about that world out there what
[1:24:17] you need to do is get completely sold
[1:24:20] out to Christ amen all anxieties all
[1:24:24] fears all things Lord forgive us I ask
[1:24:27] you this morning all of these things
[1:24:29] behind us that we don't need to walk on
[1:24:31] water we need to walk in the word that's
[1:24:34] right amen and walking in the word now
[1:24:36] we could put this history I don't have
[1:24:37] time but the breakdown of all the
[1:24:39] different denominations from the time
[1:24:41] that brother brandham was on the scene
[1:24:43] from 65 till now the breaking of these
[1:24:46] denominations and you'll see every time
[1:24:49] that there's an Aftershock every time
[1:24:51] there's an earthquake there's an
[1:24:52] Aftershock sometimes it's too small to
[1:24:54] be felt but my brother and sister every
[1:24:56] time there's a split in the body of
[1:24:58] Believers there's an Aftershock and then
[1:25:01] there'll be another split another split
[1:25:03] another split another split Satan's at
[1:25:06] work amen but you're being split I
[1:25:09] already read you the quote amen you're
[1:25:12] being split so don't judge them amen
[1:25:14] don't look out on these denominations
[1:25:16] and say oh look what's happening they
[1:25:18] don't got it but we're being split
[1:25:20] because we're being hued amen we're
[1:25:23] being hued and we look longingly at the
[1:25:25] pieces that were cut away as though they
[1:25:28] had some value but our lord Jesus says I
[1:25:31] wouldn't have cut it away if it had
[1:25:34] value it has no value say goodbye to it
[1:25:37] don't cry don't Pine don't look back to
[1:25:40] that look to what I'm doing look what
[1:25:42] I'm molding you into and what I'm
[1:25:45] molding you into is someone with endless
[1:25:48] life eternal life that's what the
[1:25:50] molding is amen it's not what we gave up
[1:25:53] in this life but it's what we're gaining
[1:25:57] amen
[1:25:59] hallelujah let's turn John 10 if we
[1:26:02] would please verse
[1:26:04] 24 yes
[1:26:10] sir then came the Jews round about him
[1:26:13] and said unto him how long Dost thou
[1:26:15] make us to doubt see they're trying to
[1:26:18] blame their doubts on
[1:26:20] Jesus I'm telling you the world we live
[1:26:22] in right now
[1:26:25] people are
[1:26:27] like well I'll tell you a little
[1:26:28] research down a certain thought line I'm
[1:26:30] not just random about this certain
[1:26:32] thought
[1:26:33] line certain preacher made a statement
[1:26:36] said well I'm probably
[1:26:39] wrong but as long as God allows me to be
[1:26:43] wrong I'll just stay
[1:26:52] wrong prophet said when God shows you
[1:26:56] you're
[1:26:57] wrong you go repent that's
[1:27:01] right that's right but this is a a
[1:27:05] church a preacher that has well I don't
[1:27:09] know
[1:27:09] 150,000
[1:27:11] followers and that's what they are
[1:27:16] yeah see the world says you follow
[1:27:18] William brandom no I'm sorry I follow
[1:27:20] Jesus Christ that's right amen and
[1:27:22] brother brandham himself said if I ever
[1:27:24] leave the word you leave me amen amen
[1:27:27] right yes sir that's pretty bold
[1:27:29] statement isn't it sets the whole thing
[1:27:31] up for people to just walk away and they
[1:27:35] did they did but they didn't have the
[1:27:38] right motive they didn't have the right
[1:27:40] reason right and of
[1:27:45] course if you don't preach it like I
[1:27:47] think it should be
[1:27:49] preached you left us you weren't a part
[1:27:52] of us utter nonsense my brother and
[1:27:55] sister their kind of Separation all goes
[1:27:58] back to this that's exactly what it is
[1:28:01] my emotion my feeling my reasoning my
[1:28:03] this my that my that oh that's no my
[1:28:06] brother and sister God has got a
[1:28:08] two-edged sword amen that he's cutting
[1:28:11] away every last bit of dead weight
[1:28:14] that's it you know I'll just take this
[1:28:16] to you I after my knee surgery years ago
[1:28:20] I ended up with a lot of um um Scar
[1:28:25] Tissue some people get it in their knees
[1:28:27] some get it in their heart some get it
[1:28:29] in their mind but scar
[1:28:31] tissue and uh you know I started
[1:28:34] researching about scar tissue and what
[1:28:36] to do I mean it it was bad my knee would
[1:28:39] snap and pop and crack and and
[1:28:43] um you know I just couldn't bring myself
[1:28:45] the idea of getting cut open again and
[1:28:48] going through all that rehab and
[1:28:50] whatever and I never even really talked
[1:28:52] to Sister Jerry about it I just looked
[1:28:54] at that and I thought I'll just live
[1:28:55] with this
[1:28:56] pain well one summer evening we had a
[1:29:01] massive Storm come rolling
[1:29:04] through and Bam killed all the
[1:29:08] power and then in just I don't know
[1:29:11] three or four minutes power comes back
[1:29:13] on every pump every pivot every
[1:29:17] sprinkler line shut
[1:29:19] down and they don't restart for a reason
[1:29:22] because if they're still spinning One
[1:29:23] Direction and the power comes back on it
[1:29:25] just shears off shs and blows up Motors
[1:29:28] and whatever so I wasn't very happy it
[1:29:30] was raining and I put my boots on and I
[1:29:33] got in the pickup and I started on one
[1:29:35] end of the farm and I just went back and
[1:29:37] restarted everything I was just right up
[1:29:39] the road from our old
[1:29:41] house and that's I've got a bank right
[1:29:43] there and because those well I won't
[1:29:47] explain it all I'm say I'm getting
[1:29:53] better but I had to close a valve down
[1:29:56] almost all the way to restart this I
[1:29:58] stepped down that bank my feet shot out
[1:30:02] and I
[1:30:03] fell and I had this tremendous pain in
[1:30:06] my knee and this loud popping noise and
[1:30:10] I literally was in that position and I
[1:30:12] thought oh my I've ruined my
[1:30:18] KNE little did I know God used a power
[1:30:22] outage little did I know God used the
[1:30:24] foolishness of
[1:30:26] preaching little did I know that God
[1:30:29] knew better than I did and when I fell
[1:30:32] with my leg underneath me and it cracked
[1:30:35] so loud and the pain was so severe and I
[1:30:38] got up and I limped up the bank and I
[1:30:40] got the pump turned on and got
[1:30:42] everything fired up and it was really
[1:30:44] weird cuz I went to climbing the pickup
[1:30:48] and
[1:30:50] hey this isn't too
[1:30:52] bad I went to the house I told Jerry I
[1:30:55] said this is I don't can't explain this
[1:30:57] I fell down and hurt myself and I feel
[1:30:59] better for
[1:31:02] it and that's why we come to the house
[1:31:04] of God exactly right cuz sometimes it
[1:31:07] hurts for a moment but in the end if we
[1:31:10] don't push back from God if we don't
[1:31:12] just Rebel and say Lord why are you
[1:31:14] doing this to me and we just say Lord
[1:31:16] thy ways are higher than my ways your
[1:31:18] thoughts are higher than my thoughts and
[1:31:21] it's going to hurt for a little while
[1:31:23] but I'll be better better for it amen
[1:31:25] and that's what God's doing right here
[1:31:27] because you see my brother and sister
[1:31:29] God is coming in such a fashion his word
[1:31:31] has the answer before we even have a
[1:31:34] question amen then came the Jews round
[1:31:37] about him said how long Dost thou make
[1:31:39] us to doubt if thou be the Christ tell
[1:31:42] us plainly he did already Jesus answered
[1:31:44] them I told you and ye believe not the
[1:31:47] works that I do in my father's name they
[1:31:49] bear witness of me but ye believe not
[1:31:52] because ye are not of my sheep as I said
[1:31:55] unto you that's right that's pretty
[1:31:57] direct my brother and sister you can't
[1:32:00] understand it because you're in the
[1:32:02] wrong identity that's
[1:32:07] right my sheep hear my voice that's
[1:32:11] right and I know them and they follow me
[1:32:15] amen there should be no offense my
[1:32:17] brother and sister no one should stop
[1:32:19] and say well I guess I must not be a
[1:32:21] sheep cuz I'm struggling to follow no
[1:32:23] you might be following at the very end
[1:32:25] of the herd but you're still part of
[1:32:28] God's flock you're still his sheep at
[1:32:30] whatever stage or position you're in
[1:32:33] he's there he's made a claim to you and
[1:32:36] I give unto them eternal life and they
[1:32:39] shall never perish amen endless life
[1:32:43] endless life neither shall any man pluck
[1:32:46] them out of my hand this is what I made
[1:32:48] the comment earlier what do you got to
[1:32:49] worry about what are we worrying about
[1:32:52] Saints what are we worrying about the
[1:32:53] the spirit of leoa and what governments
[1:32:56] are doing and wars and the rumors of
[1:32:58] wars and wicked spirits and Antichrist
[1:33:01] Spirits what do we got to worry about we
[1:33:04] can't be plucked out of his hand he's
[1:33:06] already solidly taken possession of us
[1:33:10] and there's not a single thing the devil
[1:33:12] can do to get us will we stray a little
[1:33:15] bit I've strayed I know what it's like
[1:33:17] to stray I know what it's like to be out
[1:33:19] of the will of God but I'll tell you I
[1:33:21] also know what it's like to feel that
[1:33:24] pull that keeps pulling hear a voice
[1:33:27] that keeps calling and that I find
[1:33:29] myself moving until one day I found
[1:33:32] myself back in the house of God and
[1:33:35] serving him with all of my
[1:33:37] heart
[1:33:39] amen ah Hallelujah My Father which gave
[1:33:43] them
[1:33:44] me how was that for a boastful statement
[1:33:47] that's
[1:33:48] it God gave me to you that's it you see
[1:33:53] there is is a counterbalance of Malachi
[1:33:58] 4 right
[1:34:00] there
[1:34:02] behold I send
[1:34:07] you because my
[1:34:11] father gave them
[1:34:15] me are you with me amen are you
[1:34:17] following me today the reason you
[1:34:20] believe is because God gave himself self
[1:34:24] Amen to you
[1:34:29] amen
[1:34:37] H is greater than all and no man is able
[1:34:40] to pluck them out of my father's hand I
[1:34:42] and my father amen are one amen well
[1:34:46] hallelujah amen that means you and the
[1:34:49] father are one that's it that's exactly
[1:34:51] right amen amen that's right absolutely
[1:34:54] see just as Jesus ministry I'll be
[1:34:57] finished in just a moment just as Jesus
[1:35:00] ministry separated in that day is minist
[1:35:03] Ministry is separating in this
[1:35:05] day people are I I I just come across
[1:35:08] the deal the other day and individuals
[1:35:10] like well the message of the hour tore
[1:35:14] my family in
[1:35:17] half did
[1:35:19] it does man have that much power over
[1:35:22] you
[1:35:26] I wish they'd catch a revelation I
[1:35:28] really do I'm not speaking phous I wish
[1:35:30] they'd catch a revelation
[1:35:33] unbelief tore my family in
[1:35:39] half amen but the devil always HDs
[1:35:43] brother Adam would know this as a
[1:35:45] hunter Antelope being what they are you
[1:35:49] can just take a cut out of
[1:35:52] cardboard
[1:35:54] paint red and white on it so that it
[1:35:56] looks like a
[1:35:58] Herford and you can walk right out
[1:36:00] through the Sage Brush to an
[1:36:05] envelope the envelope stands there looks
[1:36:09] at it
[1:36:11] decides you know Spirit of leody deia is
[1:36:14] not really a
[1:36:17] problem it's not even a cow it's
[1:36:20] cardboard but it's last dying moment
[1:36:23] that antelope is no doubt thinking that
[1:36:26] dirty no good
[1:36:29] Herford had nothing to do with the
[1:36:32] Herford had all to do with the fact that
[1:36:36] the antalope couldn't deal with
[1:36:42] himself amen that probably didn't even
[1:36:44] make sense but it sounded good to
[1:36:47] me you see let's quit blaming our
[1:36:49] position on somebody else let's quit
[1:36:51] blaming our position on God
[1:36:54] let's start standing on the word and we

[1:38:52] own amen hallelujah amen some people say

[1:43:09] ago my relationship with the Lord was
[1:43:13] lit but it certainly
[1:43:16] wasn't what you would call a real
[1:43:19] fire and I used to sit in church
[1:43:24] and I'd figure out how to fix a tractor
[1:43:27] and I'd remind myself what I needed to
[1:43:29] do on
[1:43:32] today I remember things and my brain
[1:43:35] would then become absorbed in
[1:43:38] that and I can declare to
[1:43:40] you
[1:43:42] absolute God was in that little church
[1:43:44] at that time
[1:43:46] speaking but I didn't hear
[1:43:49] him and you can walk out the door and
[1:43:51] say I didn't hear God
[1:43:54] today but that doesn't mean he wasn't
[1:43:56] speaking that's right let's put
[1:43:59] ourselves in a
[1:44:02] position
[1:44:04] anticipation
[1:44:06] expectation that God is not going to
[1:44:09] fail his own word and he says you
