[41:17] there was a lot of them poor people went
[41:19] home for Thanksgiving and now they're
[41:21] just sitting in their rooms so you know
[41:25] it's just hard to understand sometimes
[41:27] but uh certainly appreciate your prayers
[41:29] for our mother and uh I don't know to
[41:33] those of you that uh communicate with
[41:35] brother pant sister aona um just keep
[41:38] them in prayer amen uh the Lord just
[41:41] come the surgeon as as you probably know
[41:44] the surgeon said that he thought the
[41:45] surgery went well and um but we're going
[41:49] Beyond well right amen you know as that
[41:52] one leper that come back into the
[41:54] presence he caught a revelation saying
[41:57] it wasn't that he said hey I need to go
[41:59] back and say thank you he caught a
[42:01] revelation see Jesus told him the word
[42:04] and it was by Revelation that the word
[42:07] that was spoken was revealed and those
[42:10] others went off to show themsel to their
[42:14] Earthly priest and he caught a
[42:16] revelation this is my priest amen and to
[42:22] be made not just healed of our infirmity
[42:24] to be made well but to be made
[42:27] completely whole amen and that's what
[42:29] we're asking for each and every one you
[42:31] might have a health issue in your life
[42:33] don't just reach out hoping that God
[42:35] would take some symptom away from you
[42:38] but believe the
[42:40] word and desire and press to be
[42:43] completely whole amen let's just stand
[42:46] today so I just ask you to remember
[42:48] brother pant sister aona especially uh
[42:52] just you know their heart's desire
[42:55] Saints you know if it was a complicated
[42:58] situation but if it was different uh
[43:00] they would be here this morning in our
[43:02] presence and we thank the Lord for that
[43:06] um I want to speak to you this morning
[43:09] taking our thought out of the book of
[43:11] Romans the 8th chapter but I want to
[43:14] title it this morning as I am persuaded
[43:18] and um my brother and sister when we
[43:20] realize just how important that is you
[43:24] know um I don't want to jump ahead of
[43:26] myself but you can have
[43:28] Revelations you can see the
[43:31] supernatural you can even have God speak
[43:34] to you and not be fully
[43:38] persuaded that is part of the foundation
[43:40] when brother brandham said you can be
[43:42] anointed of the Holy Ghost and go to
[43:45] hell see you could see that presence you
[43:48] can see that milky swirl of the Holy
[43:51] Spirit moving through the service
[43:53] through the the building and you can say
[43:55] I was there when this happened
[43:58] you simp need to be
[44:00] persuaded it's not just a matter of what
[44:02] you witnessed amen Romans 828 today
[44:10] amen amen feel free to say Amen to the
[44:13] word today amen don't don't let anything
[44:16] come and hinder you you know had a
[44:19] little of this and a little of that
[44:20] happen and I feel a little bit no just
[44:23] press beyond that Veil and if it's the
[44:25] word of God you feel free I'm not
[44:27] telling you you have to but just feel
[44:29] free to say Amen to the word and we know
[44:32] that all things work together for good
[44:35] to them that love God I'm going to
[44:37] punctuate that with an
[44:39] amen to them who are called according to
[44:42] his purpose that's
[44:45] me amen for whom he did for know he also
[44:49] did predestinate to be conformed to the
[44:52] image of his son that he might be the
[44:55] firstborn among many
[44:58] brother moreover whom he did pred
[45:01] predestinate them he also called and
[45:03] whom he called them he also Justified
[45:07] and whom he justified them he also
[45:10] glorified now I want to ask you this
[45:12] morning is there any glorified people
[45:14] here in the sanctuary today
[45:18] amen what shall we then say to these
[45:22] things if God before us who can be
[45:26] against us
[45:30] he that spared not his own son but
[45:34] delivered him up for us all how shall he
[45:37] not with him also freely give us all
[45:45] things who shall lay anything to the
[45:47] charge of God's elect it is God that
[45:51] justify now I want to just put a a
[45:55] slight
[45:57] uh different
[45:58] phraseology phraseology to to that last
[46:01] line it is God that justifi y I want to
[46:06] present it to you and this won't change
[46:09] I don't believe this
[46:11] scripture but it is God who sets the
[46:18] rules
[46:19] yes see it's not man it wasn't the
[46:23] priest of the
[46:25] Sanhedrin they they were
[46:28] the knowledged ones they were the
[46:31] educated ones they were the ones that
[46:33] they all gathered around Nicodemus was
[46:36] the one they all come and said Master
[46:37] teach
[46:39] us but ultimately it was Nicodemus that
[46:42] realized something more yeah something
[46:46] of different rules something that I
[46:48] didn't understand what must we
[46:51] do Jesus rebuked him but not really a
[46:55] rebuke he says you're a master of
[46:59] Israel and you don't know these things
[47:02] you see God sets the rules it wasn't a
[47:05] school it wasn't a religious whatever it
[47:07] was in how many years there's no such
[47:09] thing we honor our elders but there's no
[47:11] such thing as seniority that's right in
[47:14] the body of Christ amen Heavenly Father
[47:17] we come before you today just asking
[47:19] Lord that you would speak to us father
[47:21] ask you to speak freely Lord come
[47:25] directly in our midst father that we
[47:27] could stand today and be able to say
[47:30] that is me or that applies to me I see
[47:33] that Lord for we want to come closer to
[47:36] you Lord we want to come right directly
[47:39] into your presence ask father for your
[47:41] blessings upon all those father uh here
[47:44] in the church and father those around
[47:46] the world the bride of Christ ask you to
[47:49] be with them we ask in the name of Jesus
[47:51] Christ amen amen you may be seated
[48:07] I want to just go back into these verses
[48:11] here in um the
[48:16] 35th
[48:18] um verse and we want to
[48:22] then continue this on or start with 34th
[48:25] I mean continue this on who is he that
[48:30] condemneth it is Christ that died y
[48:33] rather that is risen
[48:35] again who is even at the right hand of
[48:38] God who also maketh intercession for
[48:42] us now I love this and and I remember
[48:46] the first time I've read this scripture
[48:47] many times through the years and when
[48:49] this first reached out and and struck me
[48:52] uh I realized that sometimes we can just
[48:55] read the scripture you might say
[48:57] mechanically uh just reading the
[48:59] sentences moving to the next verse but
[49:02] when we stop and take the time to really
[49:04] examine or look into the word of God and
[49:07] it struck me one day as I was reading
[49:09] this it's not what shall separate us but
[49:13] it's who that's right and we realize my
[49:15] brother and sister that the only way
[49:17] Satan can move in your life and cause
[49:20] you distress and dysfunction is if you
[49:23] agree with him right exactly right as
[49:26] long long as you stand on the word of
[49:28] God now we're not talking about when I'm
[49:30] good enough or when I reach some
[49:32] Pinnacle of whatever that's not what
[49:34] it's saying but when you recognize all I
[49:37] have to do is continue to agree to the
[49:40] word of God and Satan is bound it is
[49:44] when we start to and pardon me for
[49:46] putting it in this phraseology but it's
[49:48] when we start to say Amen to Satan's
[49:51] words amen so be it then that's when our
[49:55] trouble starts amen amen so he says
[49:58] right here who shall separate us from
[50:01] the love of Christ now my brother and
[50:04] sister that only who that is in control
[50:06] of that it's not Satan it's
[50:12] you now I'm talking to Sons and
[50:14] Daughters of God right who's already had
[50:16] a propitiation already had an advocate
[50:18] already standing on the word of God the
[50:21] blood was shed for you I'm not talking
[50:22] about the rank Heathen that cares
[50:24] nothing about God
[50:28] who shall separate us from the love of
[50:29] Christ shall
[50:32] tribulation or
[50:34] distress or persecution or famine or
[50:38] nakedness or Peril or
[50:41] sword as it is written for thy sake we
[50:44] are killed all the day long we are
[50:46] counted as sheep for the slaughter now
[50:50] I'm telling you my brother and sister
[50:52] this goes against the human
[50:55] nature the human nature will do whatever
[50:58] it takes to live right the human nature
[51:01] will betray another
[51:04] person to uh uh Accord life for
[51:12] thems but we're counted as sheep right
[51:16] oh my when you want to be sheep in his
[51:18] pasture you got to be sheep when the
[51:19] tribulation comes too I'm not talking
[51:22] about the Great Tribulation I'm just
[51:24] talking about tribulation in your life
[51:27] nay in all these things we are more than
[51:29] conquerors through him that loved us for
[51:33] I am persuaded this is where I took my
[51:36] thought today for I am
[51:39] persuaded oh can we say that together
[51:42] for I am
[51:45] persuaded that neither death nor life
[51:48] nor angels nor principalities nor powers
[51:51] nor things present nor things to come
[51:55] nor height
[51:57] nor depth nor any other creature shall
[52:00] be able to separate us from the love of
[52:03] God which is in Christ Jesus our lord
[52:08] amen I'd like to modify if you don't
[52:10] mind tonight today uh verse 39 nor
[52:14] height nor depth nor any creature shall
[52:16] be able to separate me that's right amen
[52:20] get it down make it personal not just
[52:22] talking Collective as a group but bring
[52:25] it right down look the preacher wasn't
[52:27] preaching to me the scripture wasn't
[52:29] talking to just every I mean preaching
[52:31] to everybody else uh he wasn't just
[52:32] talking to that he it was speaking this
[52:35] was written for me amen and and I
[52:38] believe this and I I lay a hold to this
[52:41] because I I am persuaded that this
[52:43] scripture applies to me amen hallelujah
[52:47] amen so we want to take our thought or
[52:49] title today I am persuaded amen those
[52:53] are very powerful words my brother and
[52:55] sister that is not I have been preached
[52:58] to or I have been told of but it is
[53:03] there the personal acknowledgement that
[53:05] what I heard from the Gospel of Jesus
[53:09] Christ completely convinced me yes in
[53:13] other words Satan no longer has my ear
[53:16] amen he no longer has a piece of my
[53:19] heart amen he does not even have a piece
[53:22] or portion of my
[53:25] destiny I am a Son of God I am a
[53:27] daughter of
[53:29] God and in this my brother and sister we
[53:33] can come to the
[53:36] conclusion that there is a power that is
[53:39] greater than all of the spirit of
[53:42] leoa because leoda is contining
[53:46] continuing to to try to convince
[53:50] us that this modified form of religion
[53:55] now brother brandham tells us saints
[53:56] that that the the denominational church
[54:00] I'm sorry my mind is just galloped off
[54:01] over the hill I'm trying to catch it uh
[54:04] the denominational Church my brother and
[54:06] sister they have not completely forsaken
[54:09] the
[54:09] gospel the word says that they had left
[54:13] the gospel
[54:15] powerless
[54:18] right go
[54:21] ahead you can go however computer phone
[54:24] whatever you can go to to websites you
[54:28] can go to uh uh uh um YouTube listen to
[54:33] them you you'll think wow they're
[54:34] they're preaching pretty
[54:36] straight they're preaching pretty
[54:38] straight what we sometimes think oh oh
[54:41] they're just preaching some absolute
[54:43] aberration it's just a bunch of garbage
[54:46] but you'll listen and they're preaching
[54:47] pretty straight but my brother and
[54:49] sister the very thing they're preaching
[54:52] is powerless to the people right it does
[54:55] not make to change in them as a group of
[54:59] people yes that's right so regardless of
[55:02] what the minister might get up and say
[55:05] you know he's talking about you must be
[55:06] born
[55:08] again but you see it's lost its power
[55:10] it's lost its
[55:13] virtue you see that's why I've been
[55:16] questioned before brother Paul you kind
[55:18] of seem to give an awful lot of Grace to
[55:21] them well I do my brother and sister
[55:23] because without the quickening power of
[55:26] the word we would look at that same
[55:29] equation and we would be saying the word
[55:32] is being preached but we as the bride of
[55:35] Christ don't want just the word alone we
[55:38] want the quickening power of the word we
[55:42] want the word to bring life into us and
[55:45] we are here with a hunger that was
[55:48] supernaturally placed in us to say I am
[55:51] hungry for the word and that's why my
[55:53] brother and sister I've said this many
[55:55] times and I stand on it it's just an
[55:57] opinion but I stand on it why brother
[55:59] brand did not in the early uh times of
[56:02] his ministry did not go now you people
[56:04] leave all of that you leave all of that
[56:06] what did Brother brandom do these people
[56:08] come they were anointed by the Holy
[56:09] Ghost Hearts were discerned people were
[56:11] healed the word was open and preached
[56:13] and then he tells them go back that's
[56:15] right amen seems contrary right but
[56:19] there was one thing that he knew that
[56:21] once they had experienced the quickening
[56:24] power of the word they could not go back
[56:27] and be satisfied he knew that they would
[56:31] go there and it would be a matter of
[56:33] time that conflict would start because
[56:36] then and we have some personal
[56:37] testimonies of of brothers that I've met
[56:40] through the years they're mostly older
[56:42] now many of them have passed on but they
[56:44] talk about this and they say you know my
[56:46] wife and I you know we we experienced
[56:49] something we we felt the presence of God
[56:51] we saw some Supernatural things some
[56:53] discernment and and he told us go back
[56:55] to our church and we went back to our
[56:58] church thinking when we bring this to
[57:00] them that they will be as excited as we
[57:02] are but when they brought it they said
[57:05] oh no no don't worry about
[57:08] that and then as the pastor the ministry
[57:11] started preaching things they had to go
[57:13] and say oh but Pastor the word says and
[57:18] it wasn't long that they either felt
[57:20] compelled to leave or were kicked
[57:22] out because you see God didn't have to
[57:25] have someone tell them you can't go
[57:27] there you can't go there my brother and
[57:29] sister where the carcass is is where
[57:31] you're going to find the bride of Christ
[57:34] amen she can't stay over here on this
[57:37] boxed up carrying that they want to give
[57:39] to you now you got to go for that fresh
[57:42] word amen amen and as we come we see my
[57:45] brother and sister that the word of God
[57:48] is moving in such a powerful way that
[57:50] Sons and Daughters of God can no longer
[57:53] sit still my brother and sister if we
[57:55] had a model and day Journey wait we
[57:58] do we have our own version of 40 years
[58:02] in the
[58:04] wilderness we have our own version of a
[58:07] bride of people with a promise being
[58:09] tested with
[58:11] time and many have not stood that test
[58:14] of
[58:17] time and it breaks my heart yes it
[58:20] does but you see there is a
[58:24] people that can't help themselves right
[58:28] it's something inside of them something
[58:31] stirring the heart something drawing
[58:34] well life is hard well I tell you I have
[58:37] a friend that's very fond of this
[58:39] phrase he says life is hard and then you
[58:44] die get used to
[58:47] it I don't know why he says
[58:50] that but he says
[58:52] it and I'd have to say it is true
[58:57] life is
[59:00] hard and without a
[59:02] Rapture that's
[59:06] it but wait the part he didn't equate
[59:10] that's it is if you start talking about
[59:13] this to the bride of Christ she's able
[59:16] to say I've already died that's right
[59:18] praise the Lord I already died I'm not
[59:20] looking to the end of my life I'm not
[59:22] looking to a grave somewhere I'm looking
[59:24] to the fact that I di died and was born
[59:27] again amen hallelujah that's right now
[59:30] you know it's been a couple Sundays I
[59:32] guess since I preached but my last
[59:34] Sunday service I was speaking to you of
[59:35] the lepers and how that they were
[59:37] anointed to fulfill the word of God and
[59:40] you look at that and we see these lepers
[59:42] now they're outside of the city outside
[59:45] of the gates and they're discussing
[59:46] their situation now my brother and
[59:48] sister remember it's just them in the
[59:51] conversation there's no priests there's
[59:52] no theologians there's no one else
[59:55] that's just them and they're discussing
[59:57] their situation and as they discuss this
[1:00:00] you'll see you might say in a modified
[1:00:02] form we can look at this just knowing
[1:00:04] human nature that they themselves they
[1:00:07] persuaded themselves you realize
[1:00:10] that there wasn't a priest there there
[1:00:12] wasn't someone of great influence there
[1:00:14] it was they themselves but what we need
[1:00:17] to recognize is that there was a
[1:00:20] anointing that was coming upon them that
[1:00:23] even as they reasoned out or persuaded
[1:00:26] themselves of what they should do if if
[1:00:28] we stay here we
[1:00:30] die oh my brother and sister I hope you
[1:00:33] see that there is an anointing to every
[1:00:35] decision that you and I make there is no
[1:00:39] decision that is just arbitrary that is
[1:00:42] without influence there's always an
[1:00:44] influence amen and they're there saying
[1:00:47] if we stay here in the gates of the city
[1:00:49] we will die if we go into the city we
[1:00:52] will die so let's go down here to the
[1:00:55] city Ians and if they have mercy on us
[1:00:58] we might live and if they don't what
[1:01:00] have we got we'll just die so they were
[1:01:03] fully persuaded when they went down
[1:01:06] there I don't believe now this is just a
[1:01:08] personal take I have nothing to back it
[1:01:09] up but I don't believe as they were
[1:01:11] walking down to the syrians camp that
[1:01:14] they kept looking back to the city to
[1:01:16] see if anything had
[1:01:19] changed they were persuaded amen there's
[1:01:22] nothing inside of the city there's out
[1:01:24] nothing outside of the city our only
[1:01:26] hope is that they would have mercy on us
[1:01:29] and so they were anointed to take that
[1:01:31] position and start in that journey and
[1:01:34] as they walked in that Journey my
[1:01:35] brother and sister because they were
[1:01:37] persuaded did not mean that they did not
[1:01:39] face doubts did not have fears I have no
[1:01:42] doubt that as they walk down there they
[1:01:44] got the Jitters any of you ever get the
[1:01:46] Jitters I'll tell you I've been scared
[1:01:49] so bad before I had the Jitter so bad I
[1:01:51] couldn't hardly even
[1:01:54] function I have no doubt as closer they
[1:01:56] got to Camp they got the
[1:01:58] Jitters they were like wow you know the
[1:02:01] first guy out here might say oh a bunch
[1:02:02] of lepers and might just strike them
[1:02:04] down with the
[1:02:07] sword but it didn't stop them did
[1:02:10] it they face the
[1:02:12] fears of today of Tomorrow next week
[1:02:16] next month next year they face those
[1:02:19] fears but because they were persuaded
[1:02:22] they pressed on Amen Hallelujah
[1:02:26] you see they were
[1:02:30] persuaded under that anointing you see
[1:02:34] someone had to fulfill the word of
[1:02:37] God and God chose them my why didn't he
[1:02:41] choose a great arbitrator to come with
[1:02:43] his great you know robes and his great
[1:02:45] counsel and sit down to arbitrate this
[1:02:47] agreement God said no what I'm going to
[1:02:49] do is use the impossible to change what
[1:02:52] we think is impossible to bring about an
[1:02:55] out come of a prophecy that must be
[1:02:59] fulfilled you know we live in the day my
[1:03:03] brother and sister we need to be fully
[1:03:04] persuaded amen cuz I can tell you
[1:03:07] anything less than pul fully persuaded
[1:03:09] you will not like the
[1:03:13] results right you know it is a very
[1:03:15] common
[1:03:17] Earthly
[1:03:19] symptom of not being fully
[1:03:23] persuaded I know your minds are diing
[1:03:26] deep to try and find
[1:03:27] something but when you have buyer
[1:03:31] remorse it's evidence you weren't fully
[1:03:34] persuaded
[1:03:38] right now I won't pick out any
[1:03:41] individual whatever I think all of you
[1:03:43] will know but I'm going to use out
[1:03:45] something that would be more like what I
[1:03:48] would
[1:03:50] experience you walk in to
[1:03:53] Sportsman's and for years you've wanted
[1:03:56] a certain
[1:03:57] pistol you have the money in your
[1:03:59] pocket a very key ingredient in the day
[1:04:02] we live in you have your wife's
[1:04:06] permission you walk in there and you
[1:04:08] walk up to the counter and you say sir I
[1:04:11] would like to look at that pistol right
[1:04:14] there when the man lovingly pulls it off
[1:04:17] of the wall and lays it down in front of
[1:04:19] you and says this is a really fine
[1:04:21] pistol and you said that's right and I
[1:04:24] have the money right here and I want it
[1:04:26] to be mine you fill out the paperwork
[1:04:29] they approve you you walk out the door
[1:04:31] you go to the range you shoot it you
[1:04:34] lovingly caress
[1:04:39] it come on I know you
[1:04:42] Brothers maybe a few of you sisters
[1:04:47] even and you never ever look back
[1:04:52] once about saying I wished I hadn't
[1:04:55] bought it
[1:04:57] see you were fully
[1:04:59] persuaded but you you walk out of a
[1:05:02] store whatever it might be five bucks or
[1:05:08] 500,000 and you question yourself for
[1:05:10] days and weeks and months should I have
[1:05:12] done
[1:05:13] this see you were not fully persuaded
[1:05:16] now I bring this very carnal Earthly
[1:05:19] example to you to recognize how subtle
[1:05:23] the symptom of not being fully persuaded
[1:05:26] can be amen it is not some lifechanging
[1:05:29] event there wasn't Thunder there wasn't
[1:05:31] lightning there wasn't some kind of
[1:05:34] message across the sky but if you walk
[1:05:36] out of there and question what you have
[1:05:43] done you weren't fully persuaded amen
[1:05:46] that's
[1:05:53] right because you see anything less than
[1:05:56] being fully persuaded you won't like the
[1:05:59] results you'll be pulling as it were
[1:06:01] this gun and that's a poor analogy but I
[1:06:03] believe you're with me you'll pull that
[1:06:05] gun out of the gun cabinet for the rest
[1:06:08] of your life with a little pay of should
[1:06:11] I have bought this gun was there
[1:06:12] something better
[1:06:14] or or maybe you're broke and you sell it
[1:06:17] on Z Idaho for less than you paid for it
[1:06:20] just in a couple months and your mind is
[1:06:22] like this was a mistake this was a
[1:06:24] mistake
[1:06:26] my brother and
[1:06:27] sister I know men I'm not saying it's
[1:06:30] right but I know men that feed their
[1:06:33] family cornflakes before they'd sell a
[1:06:37] gun because they're persuaded they
[1:06:39] should own that
[1:06:40] gun now some of you will go oh I ain't
[1:06:43] right just as the child's joke is I'm
[1:06:47] just
[1:06:49] preaching now I want to bring to you an
[1:06:52] example out of this scripture my brother
[1:06:55] and sister
[1:06:56] that shows us how we must be persuaded
[1:07:00] and the results of it would reflect how
[1:07:03] persuaded we are in First Kings the 13th
[1:07:07] chapter behold there come a man of God
[1:07:09] out of Judah by the word of the Lord
[1:07:11] unto bethl and Jobo stood by the altar
[1:07:14] to burn
[1:07:15] incense and he cried against the altar
[1:07:18] in the word of the Lord and said oh alar
[1:07:20] oh altar thus saith the Lord behold the
[1:07:22] child shall be born into the house of
[1:07:24] David Josiah by name and upon thee shall
[1:07:27] he offer Priests of the high place that
[1:07:29] burn incense upon thee and men's bones
[1:07:31] shall be burnt upon thee and he gave a
[1:07:34] sign the same day saying this is a sign
[1:07:36] which the Lord has spoken Behold The
[1:07:38] Altar shall be rent and the ashes that
[1:07:40] are upon it shall be poured
[1:07:42] out and I'm not going to read every bit
[1:07:44] of this scripture I'm going to just
[1:07:46] preach it to you and when it came to
[1:07:48] pass Jobo was opposed to this prophecy
[1:07:52] of this prophet he was up in AR arms of
[1:07:56] this prophecy and so there it was that
[1:08:00] Jobo hears this and and he's saying of
[1:08:03] the man of God which cried against the
[1:08:05] altar he he's saying lay hold on him
[1:08:08] amen as though killing the messenger
[1:08:11] would stop the
[1:08:13] message my brother and sister as though
[1:08:16] a
[1:08:17] repudiating what has been spoken will
[1:08:21] somehow undo what is
[1:08:23] spoken see that's the spirit of the day
[1:08:25] that we live in right now there's many
[1:08:27] voices that are repudiating what has
[1:08:30] been spoken they they are saying it is
[1:08:33] false it is false but I'm here to tell
[1:08:36] you if you have a circle of friends
[1:08:38] around the world if you have studied if
[1:08:40] you pay attention you'll see even though
[1:08:43] they repudiated it it is still coming to
[1:08:47] pass you see just because the naysayers
[1:08:50] say nay my brother and sister does not
[1:08:53] take it from being the word of God
[1:08:57] and so as they say no it can't be so I
[1:08:59] find it interesting there are men that I
[1:09:02] know have made certain statements and
[1:09:04] not even two years have went by except
[1:09:07] for they'll never eat their words they
[1:09:08] will never ever bring it up they will
[1:09:10] never stand behind what they said but
[1:09:13] the very things they said can't be so
[1:09:15] have been Vindicated to be so but you'll
[1:09:18] never hear them it becomes a narrative
[1:09:21] that they abandon and they pick up
[1:09:23] another narrative right because you see
[1:09:26] if they're anointed to say nay then
[1:09:28] that's all they can do just like four
[1:09:30] lepers were anointed to go to the
[1:09:32] syrians they must follow the path that
[1:09:35] they are anointed to follow and as they
[1:09:38] move down that path they will say this
[1:09:40] isn't of God this isn't of God this
[1:09:42] isn't of God and God vindicates it
[1:09:45] anyhow you see God didn't really care
[1:09:47] what their opinion
[1:09:49] was and as Jobo is there Jobo saying lay
[1:09:52] a holds of him
[1:09:56] but you know
[1:09:57] what whether God's in this or not God's
[1:10:00] job is to vindicate it not you and
[1:10:03] I we're not to go out and say we're
[1:10:05] going to make this message come to pass
[1:10:08] no more than we as Sinners no more than
[1:10:10] we of the lust of the flesh pride of
[1:10:12] life lust of the mind all of these
[1:10:14] various things that make up all the the
[1:10:16] deficiencies of of the human nature all
[1:10:18] the things that we call Sin no more than
[1:10:20] we can just make a mind up and say I'll
[1:10:22] deliver myself from this my brother and
[1:10:25] sister no more can they stop the word of
[1:10:27] the Lord coming to pass than a man can
[1:10:29] reform himself and do away with his sin
[1:10:33] many a man that was a drunk said I will
[1:10:35] quit drinking and he
[1:10:37] did many a man that smoked says I will
[1:10:40] quit smoking and he did but no man can
[1:10:44] remit a man's
[1:10:51] sin and so as
[1:10:54] Jobo he puts forth his hand against him
[1:10:58] and his arm dries up that he could not
[1:11:00] even pull it he could not even move it
[1:11:02] you're talking about my brother and
[1:11:04] sister not just a war of
[1:11:07] words but we're coming down to a season
[1:11:10] a time once again where Satan bellowing
[1:11:13] out spewing
[1:11:17] forth many say it's a war of
[1:11:20] words but it's not it's something much
[1:11:24] deeper the anointing that anointed for
[1:11:29] lepers to follow the word of God to
[1:11:31] vindicate it is the same anointing that
[1:11:34] will move the bride of Christ in our day
[1:11:37] to fulfill the word of
[1:11:39] God it will stir her heart to where she
[1:11:43] without fully understanding why will
[1:11:47] follow the path that God
[1:11:50] ordained you see my brother and sister
[1:11:52] it isn't always such that we even know
[1:11:55] the the path we're walking
[1:11:57] on did you hear me did you understand
[1:12:01] that you and say this is the way I'm
[1:12:04] going but you see it's not always even
[1:12:06] we comprehend this path that we're
[1:12:09] going
[1:12:12] amen is it hot back
[1:12:15] there could somebody turn down the AC
[1:12:18] just a smidge for those of you that are
[1:12:21] not hot well it's very hot
[1:12:26] amen
[1:12:30] so when Jobo asked him pray for me
[1:12:35] please would
[1:12:37] you please pray for
[1:12:40] me and he prays for him and his arm is
[1:12:42] restored and he says you know I'll give
[1:12:44] you half my house I'll do this I'll do
[1:12:45] that come Feast at my table do all of
[1:12:48] this and here is this young Prophet says
[1:12:51] nope I've been commissioned by God to
[1:12:53] not drink anything eat anything not even
[1:12:55] travel the same path thank you and he
[1:12:58] walks out now look my brother and sister
[1:13:00] Jobo is not what we would call a
[1:13:02] Christian he was not a spiritual leader
[1:13:05] he's offering incense a a at a heathen
[1:13:07] altar right and so it's there it wasn't
[1:13:10] too hard for this young Prophet to turn
[1:13:12] Jobo down I I don't want what was in
[1:13:16] your house I don't want to partake of
[1:13:18] that I have a higher commission but look
[1:13:20] at this as we'll look down through the
[1:13:22] scripture we'll see my brother and
[1:13:23] sister and he returns another way he
[1:13:27] goes another way and returned not the
[1:13:28] way he came to bethl and now look here
[1:13:31] in verse 11 if you follow here's an old
[1:13:34] prophet and his sons came and told him
[1:13:36] the works of the man of God had done
[1:13:38] that day in bethl The Words which he had
[1:13:41] spoken unto the king them they told also
[1:13:44] to their father and his father said unto
[1:13:47] them what way went he for his sons had
[1:13:50] seen the way that the man of God went
[1:13:52] which come from Judah and he tell tells
[1:13:55] him you know what go saddle me a
[1:13:57] donkey I've got something to go out and
[1:13:59] speak to this young man I've got
[1:14:02] something he needs to hear i' I'm ano
[1:14:05] I'm anointed also I hope you catch this
[1:14:07] I'm anointed also to speak to this
[1:14:10] prophet and he goes out there and I
[1:14:12] think my brother and sister I hope you
[1:14:14] can catch this in the depth of that and
[1:14:17] he goes in verse 14 after him and he
[1:14:19] finds him sitting under an oak he said
[1:14:22] art thou the man of God that comth from
[1:14:23] Judah his testimony is I am he I a man
[1:14:26] of God Amen he said come home with me
[1:14:29] and eat bread and he said I may not
[1:14:31] return with thee nor go in with thee
[1:14:33] neither will I eat bread nor drink water
[1:14:35] with thee in this place for it was said
[1:14:38] to me by the word of the Lord Thou shalt
[1:14:40] eat no bread drink no water there nor
[1:14:43] turn again to go by the way that thou
[1:14:45] comest and he said unto him I a prophet
[1:14:48] also as Thou Art and an angel spake to
[1:14:53] me by the word of the Lord saying bring
[1:14:56] him back with thee into thine house that
[1:14:59] he may eat bread and drink
[1:15:01] water but he lied unto
[1:15:04] him now my brother and sister if you'll
[1:15:07] do uh just even a rudimentary search of
[1:15:10] the theological ideas concerning this I
[1:15:14] I I don't believe I found a single one
[1:15:16] that really
[1:15:18] connected in its entirety some HD along
[1:15:21] the edges of this but we can cut this
[1:15:23] down into the very simpli
[1:15:26] that God will stick and has stuck and
[1:15:28] will always stick with the original
[1:15:32] word God doesn't have a new word to a
[1:15:35] new
[1:15:36] generation amen and so as we look at
[1:15:39] this he says you know what I'm I'm
[1:15:41] supposed to uh uh uh come you're
[1:15:44] supposed to come with me and uh this is
[1:15:47] what I I'm want you to do so under these
[1:15:51] words he goes back with him and eats
[1:15:54] bread in his house and drinks and as
[1:15:56] they sat in the table that the word of
[1:15:58] the Lord came unto the prophet that
[1:15:59] brought him back and he cried unto the
[1:16:02] man that came from
[1:16:04] Judah for as much as thou disobeyed the
[1:16:07] mouth of the Lord and Hast not kept the
[1:16:10] Commandment which the Lord thy God
[1:16:12] commanded thee but cameth back and eaten
[1:16:15] bread and drink water in the place which
[1:16:16] the Lord did say the eat no bread and
[1:16:18] drink no water thy carcass shall not
[1:16:21] come again to the SRE of thy fathers
[1:16:25] right and we'll look at this my brother
[1:16:26] and sister and the reason I bring this
[1:16:28] an example here is this young Prophet
[1:16:32] under the anointing of the Lord he comes
[1:16:34] to bethl he's in the presence of the
[1:16:37] king he prophesies this is what God has
[1:16:40] said and Vindicated by the word of God
[1:16:43] the altar break the ashes pour out and
[1:16:46] when Jobo himself goes to raise a hand
[1:16:49] against him his arm is
[1:16:52] petrified every evidence my brother and
[1:16:54] sister that God was absolutely with
[1:16:57] him but when it come oh I hope you guys
[1:17:00] catch this but when it come down to
[1:17:03] another man of God not a heathen but
[1:17:06] another man of God saying God has spoken
[1:17:09] to me God has revealed to Me an Angel of
[1:17:11] the Lord Has Come he come now and the
[1:17:14] individual word that God come now look
[1:17:17] there's a very important part right
[1:17:19] there that we must catch the individual
[1:17:22] word of the Lord to you amen amen
[1:17:27] because you see there are some things
[1:17:30] that are
[1:17:32] permissible but God would tell you no
[1:17:36] that's right amen that's right but
[1:17:39] brother so and so or sister so and so or
[1:17:41] this family no no listen to what God
[1:17:43] says to you
[1:17:47] amen now I just use this as a carnal
[1:17:49] example I don't pay much attention to
[1:17:51] your finances so I don't think I'm
[1:17:53] throwing a rock in your pond but there's
[1:17:55] a good reason why many of us will never
[1:17:57] be
[1:18:00] rich because we wouldn't be able to
[1:18:02] listen to the Lord amen on what to do
[1:18:04] with that money that's right
[1:18:06] that's come on that's
[1:18:10] right and there's men in this message
[1:18:12] that are worth
[1:18:14] millions I know a brother who's worth a
[1:18:16] hundred so million dollars you'd never
[1:18:19] know
[1:18:21] it and you'd never know what he does
[1:18:23] with that money because money just
[1:18:25] strangely appears in places and no one
[1:18:28] can make the connection of when where
[1:18:30] how or why you see God knew he could
[1:18:33] trust that man amen with that kind of
[1:18:36] money oh don't feel bad if your bank
[1:18:39] account's empty right now God said he'd
[1:18:41] provide amen amen so just thank him give
[1:18:44] him praise for being your provider amen
[1:18:46] don't worry about what you didn't have
[1:18:48] that's right because it might be just
[1:18:50] heartache you didn't
[1:18:52] have but you look at this and see
[1:18:55] as the word come this Prophet says this
[1:18:58] is what an angel told me is that you
[1:19:00] should come to my house and if he had
[1:19:02] kept the same resolve as he had with
[1:19:05] Jobo he would have said nope the Lord
[1:19:08] said and I'm going to stick with what
[1:19:10] the Lord said I'm not deviating from it
[1:19:13] not one I owa my brother and sister he
[1:19:15] would have just waled right back to his
[1:19:17] house right back amongst his own people
[1:19:20] having done the word of God and brought
[1:19:21] it to pass but you see he put some
[1:19:24] respect well this is an elder Prophet to
[1:19:27] me more experience and my brother and
[1:19:30] sister you can see the spirit of the day
[1:19:32] is it all right just to take the spirit
[1:19:33] of this day and apply it back and look
[1:19:36] at that in the same context and there'll
[1:19:38] be those that would say but we have been
[1:19:40] in the message longer than you God has
[1:19:43] revealed to us I know it's contrary to
[1:19:46] Timothy I know it's contrary to Titus I
[1:19:49] know it's contrary to Matthew but
[1:19:52] the that's it right we sat at a dinner
[1:19:57] table we had a word after that
[1:20:00] word we had something that come forth
[1:20:03] since that was
[1:20:07] written you see what God said I want you
[1:20:11] to stick with my original word to
[1:20:14] you
[1:20:15] hallelujah amen it's not about what
[1:20:18] somebody coming later and saying well
[1:20:20] this is what God's saying now my brother
[1:20:22] and sister I believe in Revelation now
[1:20:24] now this might shock some of you I
[1:20:26] believe things will take place it's not
[1:20:28] even written in the Bible because God
[1:20:30] himself is not constrained simply by
[1:20:32] words the supernatural of who our God is
[1:20:35] is unfolding every day I'll give you an
[1:20:37] example so you don't think I'm going
[1:20:39] crazy my brother and sister Sciences Pro
[1:20:42] the universe is still expanding oh yeah
[1:20:45] so even when Jesus was standing on the
[1:20:47] earth the universe has expanded but it
[1:20:50] is not relevant to you and I amen all
[1:20:53] that we need to make the Rapture the
[1:20:55] prophet said is already in us and that's
[1:20:58] not because we have some capsule that
[1:21:00] something got poured into it's because
[1:21:02] the word is in you and I amen and the
[1:21:05] word is bringing forth a deliverance
[1:21:07] from this fleshly
[1:21:08] boundary amen so God is moving so as God
[1:21:12] chooses to do God chooses to move will
[1:21:15] God change oh my brother and sister God
[1:21:17] cannot change God cannot change but just
[1:21:21] because your name's not written in the
[1:21:23] Bible doesn't mean this every scripture
[1:21:25] is not written for you amen because God
[1:21:28] himself can include you into the word
[1:21:31] amen it doesn't have to be by ink on the
[1:21:34] page it can be by the thought and the
[1:21:36] spoken word and then the power of
[1:21:38] almighty God says make it happen and it
[1:21:43] happens can you agree with that amen you
[1:21:48] see he basically come and as we have
[1:21:50] seen in this day many voices I've heard
[1:21:53] from God since you heard from God but my
[1:21:56] brother and sister the commission that
[1:21:58] is now is the same commission as it was
[1:22:01] then and that is stay with that original
[1:22:03] word look at the results that young man
[1:22:06] would have had if he had been a 100%
[1:22:09] persuaded that's the point I'm trying to
[1:22:11] get to amen he was not 100% persuaded
[1:22:15] that that applied when another Prophet
[1:22:20] right spoke the word to him now we're
[1:22:24] not going to bring conflict right
[1:22:25] because we understand the difference
[1:22:27] between a prophet and a pastor but we
[1:22:29] can also go in the message where brother
[1:22:30] brandham says that a prophet is a pastor
[1:22:34] or a pastor preacher interchangeable as
[1:22:37] it were and so we can oh that's the only
[1:22:40] quote we
[1:22:41] need I'm a
[1:22:45] prophet well I wouldn't be lying would
[1:22:50] I oh come on don't get all nervous
[1:22:53] folks y'all bunched up in the back
[1:22:55] corner of the
[1:22:59] shed you see my
[1:23:02] point but let's get the whole picture
[1:23:05] not just a
[1:23:07] point oh look it's a year it's November
[1:23:11] whatever
[1:23:14] Day
[1:23:15] 2020 I've just realized by reading the
[1:23:18] prophet's message I'm a
[1:23:20] prophet now I've got
[1:23:25] y'all looks a gunshi I'm almost afraid
[1:23:27] to move
[1:23:32] forward I'm going to choose something so
[1:23:34] ludicrous you'll know I'm just kidding
[1:23:36] y'all are going to go home today and
[1:23:37] sell everything you have and bring me
[1:23:39] cash but not just cash I want it in
[1:23:44] Gold do you realize there's people
[1:23:47] there's people that would
[1:23:49] go and they would do
[1:23:52] such but did it line up with the
[1:23:55] word they lined up with somebody's word
[1:23:58] that's right and some people it's
[1:23:59] sufficient just to have somebody's word
[1:24:02] now I used a really ludicrous example
[1:24:04] there Saints because I want you to
[1:24:06] understand that when you hear the
[1:24:07] original word if you are not fully
[1:24:09] persuaded to that original word then
[1:24:12] another word will come and the influence
[1:24:15] behind it the individual behind it the
[1:24:17] group that is behind it will be enough
[1:24:19] to sway you in your thinking when the
[1:24:21] word of God itself told you to take get
[1:24:24] back to the original word and don't
[1:24:26] deviate don't add one don't take one
[1:24:28] away so look what happens this young man
[1:24:31] look I I can only imagine the anguish
[1:24:35] that must have struck his heart amen and
[1:24:39] so here he is that he has eaten this
[1:24:41] bread he has drank he has his donkey and
[1:24:44] he goes to go down the path and as he
[1:24:47] goes there a lion meets him my brother
[1:24:50] and sister don't you know that when he
[1:24:52] comes to this he is there grieving in
[1:24:56] his soul because he knows he has stepped
[1:24:59] away from God's word to
[1:25:02] him and I can tell you right now my
[1:25:04] brother and sister every man and woman
[1:25:06] of God that's been offered the word of
[1:25:08] God the truth of God and allows
[1:25:11] themselves to be drawn away as they come
[1:25:13] as it is into the Judgment they're not
[1:25:15] going to go there blindly they're not
[1:25:17] going to go there singing happy songs
[1:25:19] they're going to be grieving in their
[1:25:21] spirit because they were offered that
[1:25:23] original word and they failed to take
[1:25:26] and be persuaded by that word and to put
[1:25:28] value to that word and to claim that
[1:25:31] word oh I know I'm speaking a little
[1:25:33] straight but you know what just talking
[1:25:35] with a brother here the other day and he
[1:25:37] made a comment to me he says brother
[1:25:39] Paul it's very important that we do not
[1:25:41] have the blood of the people Upon Our
[1:25:42] Hands amen I'm not preaching this from
[1:25:45] Fear I'm preaching it from conviction in
[1:25:48] my heart that the truth is my brother
[1:25:50] and sister if we need to speak it well
[1:25:53] fine I'll take the grief amen but we
[1:25:56] must speak it amen amen now as we look
[1:26:00] at this my brother and sister he failed
[1:26:03] to stay with the original word and he
[1:26:05] allowed himself to be persuaded to a lie
[1:26:19] amen Lord give us wisdom
[1:26:31] and trying to do God a service without
[1:26:34] it being God's
[1:26:37] will go read the whole context okay no
[1:26:41] little puff of wind is going to blow it
[1:26:43] off no little denomination or nothing is
[1:26:45] going to blow it off no little
[1:26:47] persecution is going to blow it off it's
[1:26:50] directed to the point it's going to hit
[1:26:54] there
[1:26:55] to then God when it hits that point God
[1:26:58] will vindicate it Bullseye uh-huh
[1:27:01] exactly what he said he'll do amen my
[1:27:04] brother and sister we sing the songs we
[1:27:06] hear the specials we testify of this can
[1:27:09] we come to the place that we are so
[1:27:12] persuaded of who we are in Jesus Christ
[1:27:15] that we can look at the word and God
[1:27:18] said it and I will stand it to the end
[1:27:20] of my life because that is the truth
[1:27:23] amen persuaded if God said it it will
[1:27:26] come to pass that's right hallelujah oh
[1:27:30] hallelujah amen thus sayith the Lord it
[1:27:33] shall come to pass here it is see there
[1:27:35] you are now God had not revealed it in
[1:27:38] his provided way so they went about to
[1:27:40] do it apart from his word and apart from
[1:27:43] the season you realize we can have all
[1:27:45] the word correct if we don't have the
[1:27:47] right season we still got a problem
[1:27:49] right just the same as they have now
[1:27:52] when men no matter how sincere tried to
[1:27:55] do him a service outside of his provided
[1:27:57] way they always mess it
[1:28:01] up that's right
[1:28:03] hello it ain't just the
[1:28:07] preachers that's
[1:28:11] right like balum balam thought he was
[1:28:14] doing God of
[1:28:16] service now look what brother Brown says
[1:28:18] next do you think God
[1:28:22] lies does God ever change his
[1:28:25] mind well people act today like he did
[1:28:29] who brother brandom just cuts her right
[1:28:30] down to the right down to the scalp
[1:28:33] right
[1:28:34] here when he said for women not to cut
[1:28:36] their hair they say we can cut it Dr so
[1:28:38] and so said we could brother so and so
[1:28:41] said you're just too narrow-minded
[1:28:43] uh-huh uh-huh see well can this happen
[1:28:46] this happen yes uh-huh so and so said
[1:28:50] so God don't change his mind
[1:28:57] right did you get what I got out of that
[1:29:00] you don't know what I got that but I
[1:29:01] think you know what I got out of that
[1:29:03] amen amen I don't care what they say
[1:29:05] over here and what kind or how big that
[1:29:07] church is I don't care who this person
[1:29:10] was with and where they have been I
[1:29:11] don't care about the one over there the
[1:29:13] one down there whatever it is my brother
[1:29:15] and sister what did the word say amen I
[1:29:18] don't care who's got the latest
[1:29:20] Revelation or the latest interpretation
[1:29:23] my brother and sister what the word said
[1:29:25] you see I've got a constant there you've
[1:29:26] got a constant there that we can stand
[1:29:29] on but we've got to be
[1:29:31] persuaded oh don't I don't want you to
[1:29:33] think I'm just picking on people or
[1:29:35] thoughts but I just want you to know I
[1:29:37] just uh am out on the very loose edge of
[1:29:40] all kinds of things and information kind
[1:29:42] of comes my way sometimes it's not so
[1:29:44] fresh sometimes it is but my brother and
[1:29:47] sister you've got a whole the the word
[1:29:49] says not to be blown around by every
[1:29:50] wind of Doctrine but I tell you what
[1:29:53] there's men have come around this
[1:29:55] message right here in this United States
[1:29:57] and they are preaching this nice
[1:29:59] beautiful flowery message that's not
[1:30:01] very far off the
[1:30:04] original but it makes us feel so good
[1:30:11] we're not going to walk out of church
[1:30:13] today like them people in Grace we're
[1:30:15] going to walk out today
[1:30:18] happy we're going to walk out just so
[1:30:22] full of joy praise the
[1:30:28] lord well some of you didn't forget your
[1:30:31] smiles at
[1:30:39] home H there's only two Spirits amen
[1:30:44] right in the framework of the church
[1:30:46] amen but let me bring it down to another
[1:30:50] way that is the same only different
[1:30:52] would that be okay
[1:30:54] the same only
[1:30:57] different it's not just two spirits in
[1:30:59] the framework of the
[1:31:01] church it's the
[1:31:04] persuaded and not persuaded yeah forget
[1:31:08] about what little Doctrine they're
[1:31:10] preaching forget about what little
[1:31:12] ideology they're holding on to forget
[1:31:15] about all of this stuff cuz if you are
[1:31:19] persuaded God obligated himself to take
[1:31:23] you back back into the word
[1:31:25] amen are you with me it's not just well
[1:31:29] they've got this idea and this no my
[1:31:31] brother and sister God sent message in
[1:31:33] our day amen right Hallelujah are we
[1:31:35] persuaded that message is sufficient or
[1:31:38] do we need to look for
[1:31:39] another remember what happened when
[1:31:41] John's eyes got dimmed over he sends a
[1:31:44] message out we acknowledge who Jesus is
[1:31:47] and we acknowledge all that's happened
[1:31:50] but we're not sure it's him do we look
[1:31:53] for another
[1:31:56] it can happen to you it can happen to
[1:32:00] me but when you're fully persuaded amen
[1:32:04] they took the message back to John what
[1:32:06] was that message we think this is the
[1:32:11] Messiah this is the
[1:32:15] Messiah and John gave his life for this
[1:32:17] gospel amen that was enough took him
[1:32:20] through that little time that little
[1:32:21] wavering those little currents that blew
[1:32:24] around those of you have flown in a
[1:32:25] small plane you know what that's like a
[1:32:27] current that you never feel in a a 747
[1:32:30] in a little plane it tosses you
[1:32:33] around but when he got through that
[1:32:35] bumpy time and it was anchored back in
[1:32:37] his soul I did see the signs I saw the
[1:32:40] Wonders I heard the word preach I saw it
[1:32:42] come to pass I'm persuaded and he went
[1:32:45] and gave his life for it you see you
[1:32:47] can't fault the man or the woman for the
[1:32:49] shaky time of their life but my brother
[1:32:51] and sister you can fault as it were for
[1:32:53] their decision of what direction they
[1:32:56] go hallelujah amen
[1:33:01] hallelujah you know I'm going to say
[1:33:04] before we go on to the book of
[1:33:06] Colossians I'm going to say this the
[1:33:07] believer in this age you realize that
[1:33:10] you're a very unique bird amen
[1:33:13] hallelujah very unique
[1:33:15] bird
[1:33:17] amen for as the prophet of God brings
[1:33:20] this example about the eagle and how
[1:33:22] that the eagle can fly much higher and
[1:33:26] see much further than any other bird my
[1:33:29] brother and sister we have some Hawks
[1:33:31] that live in the trees there close to
[1:33:33] our
[1:33:34] house that one Hawk I'm not exaggerating
[1:33:36] that thing Must Be This Tall it is just
[1:33:39] huge and every bird when it flies around
[1:33:42] there every other Hawk and anything else
[1:33:44] just you never see anybody pulling out
[1:33:46] in front of
[1:33:47] it they all give respect to that bird
[1:33:51] incredible bird
[1:33:54] I could give you all kinds of stories
[1:33:55] that just marvel me about that
[1:33:58] bird but my brother and sister
[1:34:01] regardless of how Majestic this great
[1:34:04] big red tail hawk is he's not an eagle
[1:34:08] that's right that's
[1:34:13] right probably has a bigger
[1:34:16] Church yeah yeah that's right brother
[1:34:21] David you see
[1:34:24] the Bride of this age the believer in
[1:34:26] this age my brother and sister has to be
[1:34:29] fully
[1:34:30] persuaded the season of being blown to
[1:34:33] and fro is over amen we have to decide
[1:34:37] where we stand and and I have quotes to
[1:34:40] back this up I just don't have them here
[1:34:41] I don't mean rude like okay you don't
[1:34:44] like what I said I can back it up with
[1:34:45] the quote I don't mean that but the
[1:34:48] prophet of God shows us my brother and
[1:34:50] sisters so clearly how in the day that
[1:34:53] we are living the culmination of all the
[1:34:56] spirits of the ages all of Satan's plan
[1:34:59] for the ages is all coming together he's
[1:35:02] looking now the book says different but
[1:35:04] he's ignoring the book just like many
[1:35:06] Christians do that's
[1:35:10] right but we got to be fully persuaded
[1:35:13] in
[1:35:14] laa not just one bit of Doubt because we
[1:35:17] have one bit of Doubt Satan exploits
[1:35:19] that little
[1:35:20] doubt now I'll tell you let me just
[1:35:22] share with you about this Hawk for just
[1:35:25] one more time we'll move on we're
[1:35:27] harvesting corn if any of you ever been
[1:35:30] around a self-propelled Chopper uh they
[1:35:32] are so loud you can't hardly hear
[1:35:34] yourself talk if you're standing outside
[1:35:36] of
[1:35:37] one and one day I was chopping corn just
[1:35:39] right probably not a hundred yards from
[1:35:41] the tree where this Hawk lives and as
[1:35:43] I'm going up the road there this great
[1:35:45] big Mouse runs out I mean a huge mouse
[1:35:50] and he runs out about four rows from the
[1:35:52] head of this chop I can see him out in
[1:35:54] front of me right here and here comes
[1:35:57] this Hawk just flying down got his wings
[1:36:01] tucked in and his feet out he's looking
[1:36:03] at
[1:36:04] lunch but did you know that I and the
[1:36:07] hawk got to the
[1:36:08] mouse time and when the hawk was
[1:36:12] probably three foot off the
[1:36:14] ground he flared away from the
[1:36:19] chopper just a little bit
[1:36:24] he didn't go away and say I'm not a hawk
[1:36:26] any longer he didn't say I have no
[1:36:27] courage he didn't say I'm not hungry he
[1:36:30] just flared away from it because he felt
[1:36:34] intimidated he felt overwhelmed he felt
[1:36:38] distracted and I got to witness this
[1:36:41] that he missed that Mouse by about that
[1:36:46] much but he missed
[1:36:50] it if he' have stayed the course
[1:36:55] he wouldn't have got
[1:36:57] hurt you know three or four rows you
[1:37:00] know is you know here to the wall he had
[1:37:03] plenty of
[1:37:05] space but he allowed all the DraStic
[1:37:08] radical things that were happening
[1:37:10] around
[1:37:13] him for just a
[1:37:16] moment he veered away from what was the
[1:37:20] course that he had
[1:37:21] said are you with me yeah
[1:37:26] amen
[1:37:29] Leia lot is
[1:37:32] happening people asking
[1:37:35] questions how long before they kick us
[1:37:37] out of our churches brother
[1:37:39] Paul I'm not concerned about how long it
[1:37:41] is before they kick me out of our
[1:37:43] church kick us out of our church I'm not
[1:37:47] concerned with that I'm concerned with
[1:37:49] God helping me in the age that I live in
[1:37:51] and my weaknesses and my fa faur and my
[1:37:54] fears and my shortcomings oh can we talk
[1:37:56] like that amen I'm not concerned when
[1:37:59] they come and try to turn this into a
[1:38:01] warehouse or an office or whatever else
[1:38:02] that that doesn't matter what I want is
[1:38:04] the Holy Ghost to come and meet me in my
[1:38:07] weakness I want God to come down and
[1:38:10] meet me in my battle I want God to come
[1:38:12] down and meet me in my time of need and
[1:38:14] in that time of need he'll meet me once
[1:38:17] again amen he promised that he would
[1:38:20] it's not about well God did it once and
[1:38:22] we got to go on and just
[1:38:25] face he said they do Greater Works than
[1:38:28] these my brother and sister I believe it
[1:38:31] Hallelujah see we're in the last the
[1:38:33] most wicked of all the ages now look
[1:38:36] here in
[1:38:39] Colossians wrote this scripture right
[1:38:41] here for us didn't
[1:38:45] they for I would that you knew what
[1:38:48] great conflict I have for you and for
[1:38:51] them amen at Le oysa
[1:38:55] mhm and for as many as have not seen my
[1:38:58] face in the flesh that their hearts
[1:39:00] might be comforted being knit together
[1:39:02] in love and in all Riches of the full
[1:39:05] Assurance of understanding to the
[1:39:07] acknowledgment of the mystery of God and
[1:39:11] of the father and of Christ in whom are
[1:39:14] HID all the treasures of wisdom and
[1:39:16] knowledge and this I say lest any man
[1:39:18] should beguile you with enticing words
[1:39:23] you see my brother and sister you can
[1:39:25] trace the roots of those
[1:39:27] back and realize that when
[1:39:31] someone takes you out of this
[1:39:34] scripture on the words that someone said
[1:39:38] someone said that's it they're beguiling
[1:39:41] you that's they are persuading you and
[1:39:45] that is Satan's greatest gift that he
[1:39:47] have is he's so subtle with words he's
[1:39:50] so clever he can word it in such a way
[1:39:53] that you would look at this and say well
[1:39:55] you know this would be all
[1:39:57] right this would be okay this would this
[1:40:00] wouldn't be
[1:40:03] bad see how Satan how clever he is to do
[1:40:07] this
[1:40:10] persuading I remember one time if I
[1:40:13] could just share this quickly a
[1:40:17] Salesman showed up at our farm shop one
[1:40:19] day he had some good products he really
[1:40:23] did
[1:40:25] but you
[1:40:27] see as Christians sometimes we just have
[1:40:29] to practice what we preach we have to
[1:40:32] practice what we've heard preached and
[1:40:34] this salesman get this brother Trevor he
[1:40:36] said can I have a few minutes of your
[1:40:38] time and I said sure come to the office
[1:40:40] we walked in the office we sat down and
[1:40:42] he looked across the desk at me and he
[1:40:45] said I won't be leaving here today till
[1:40:48] I have sold you a
[1:40:51] product and I went you will be leaving
[1:40:54] here today and selling me
[1:40:58] nothing because you see he was so
[1:41:02] confident but you know his problem was
[1:41:04] he didn't say our products see here's
[1:41:06] the difference this is a subtility that
[1:41:08] Satan uses with the word of God just in
[1:41:10] a in a carnal form he didn't come saying
[1:41:13] our products are so good that you just
[1:41:17] can't live without them they will sells
[1:41:20] to you he come I
[1:41:23] yeah am so good I will sell you a
[1:41:29] product something in me says you know
[1:41:31] what that's kind of probably kind of
[1:41:33] what happened in the
[1:41:35] garden yeah
[1:41:38] yep oh that old serpent come waling in
[1:41:41] there he didn't oh look I I'm not trying
[1:41:43] to be funny but I do find it humorous
[1:41:46] most of us as men trying to court a wife
[1:41:49] we're all
[1:41:51] awkward driving you know taking them out
[1:41:54] to eat
[1:41:56] and my your hair looks the best I've
[1:41:59] ever seen
[1:42:00] today the girls thinking really I looked
[1:42:04] in the mirror and thought it was
[1:42:05] horrible and we as men just keep putting
[1:42:08] our foot in our mouth putting our foot
[1:42:09] in her mouth our foot in our
[1:42:13] mouth but not not the serpent he come in
[1:42:17] the
[1:42:17] garden hey
[1:42:19] Eve you sweet little
[1:42:22] thing I've got the answer for
[1:42:24] you I've got more knowledge Eve than you
[1:42:27] do I've got more Revelation than you do
[1:42:30] I've got everything you
[1:42:36] need so subtle yeah amen yay didn't God
[1:42:42] say see he knew to pull the word right
[1:42:44] in as part of the
[1:42:46] equation cuz without the word he
[1:42:48] wouldn't be able to get through a
[1:42:50] defense but she was there oh yes God
[1:42:52] said
[1:42:56] my brother and
[1:42:58] sister God said it is
[1:43:02] right God said right H now that's a
[1:43:06] whole another subject and I'm getting
[1:43:07] veered off here and it's time to
[1:43:09] close my mind I'm starting to remember
[1:43:12] there's always another Sunday
[1:43:15] hallelujah it's a hard memory it's a
[1:43:18] hard
[1:43:19] memory but you see my brother and sister
[1:43:22] he said lest any man man should beguile
[1:43:24] you with enticing
[1:43:26] words look Saints the day I start
[1:43:28] preaching to you or the brothers in this
[1:43:30] church start preaching to you hey we've
[1:43:32] we're the bride we've got it made just
[1:43:33] live any way you want just go out here
[1:43:35] God understands it's all settled you you
[1:43:38] either leave or kick us out that's right
[1:43:40] it comes down that simple we're not here
[1:43:42] to beguile you with words in fact like I
[1:43:45] shared with you some time back a quote
[1:43:46] from Spurgeon and he basically I don't
[1:43:49] remember exact words right now but he
[1:43:50] said if you don't make somebody mad in
[1:43:52] church then you done your job so I don't
[1:43:55] know if anybody's mad or not today but
[1:43:56] I'm going to
[1:43:57] try
[1:43:59] hallelujah oh not
[1:44:01] really see these beguiling words is to
[1:44:05] persuade to come to shift your direction
[1:44:08] to to bring you in he says though I was
[1:44:11] absent in the flesh yet I was with you
[1:44:12] in spirit joying and beholding your
[1:44:15] order and the steadfastness
[1:44:17] steadfastness of your faith in Christ
[1:44:19] and as you have therefore received
[1:44:20] Christ Jesus the Lord so
[1:44:23] walk in
[1:44:27] him you see we don't need some new
[1:44:29] fascinating flashy Revelation to get us
[1:44:32] in a rapture we need to just walk
[1:44:35] steadfast in Jesus Christ amen rooted
[1:44:40] and built up in him established in the
[1:44:43] faith as you have been taught abounding
[1:44:46] therein with Thanksgiving beware lest
[1:44:48] any man spoil you through philosophy and
[1:44:51] vain deceit after the TR tradition of
[1:44:53] men after the rudiments of the world and
[1:44:56] not after Christ for in him dwelleth all
[1:44:58] the fullness of the godhead bodily oh
[1:45:02] hallelujah amen and did you read that
[1:45:04] last verse amen oh my I tell you what I
[1:45:08] practically tore my office up this
[1:45:10] morning I just is so excites me my
[1:45:13] brother and sister when I read this amen
[1:45:16] and Paul is complete in him that's right
[1:45:20] amen and ye are complete in him which is
[1:45:23] the head of all principality and power
[1:45:27] we are not looking someday to be
[1:45:28] complete my brother and sister we're
[1:45:30] looking for what is already in us to be
[1:45:33] completely revealed amen not another
[1:45:36] gospel amen but this Gospel of Jesus
[1:45:39] Christ that's what we need Hallelujah
[1:45:42] not to be looking my brother and sister
[1:45:45] of the next thing that will come to get
[1:45:47] us excited enough to have a prayer life
[1:45:50] the next thing that gets us excited
[1:45:52] enough to read our Bible the next thing
[1:45:53] that gets excited enough to get us in
[1:45:55] church the next thing that gets us
[1:45:57] excited enough to pray for others my
[1:45:59] brother and sister no that's not what
[1:46:00] we're looking for that's already there
[1:46:03] we need to be convinced amen we need to
[1:46:05] be persuaded that this is who we are and
[1:46:09] this is what we're called for Hallelujah
[1:46:11] now remember we've gone into this but I
[1:46:13] want to touch on it once again two
[1:46:15] spirits in the church amen two groups
[1:46:17] persuaded or not persuaded amen I'm
[1:46:20] going to just speak real strong before
[1:46:21] we close if we're
[1:46:24] persuaded then God is worthy of our best
[1:46:29] amen now I'm going to speak kind of
[1:46:31] direct
[1:46:33] okay you're not going to convince me
[1:46:36] you're persuaded when you don't give
[1:46:39] anything close to your best amen now you
[1:46:42] can say that's none of your business
[1:46:43] Paul and I have to say you're
[1:46:45] right but I'm doing my part are you
[1:46:47] doing your
[1:46:49] part if you are persuaded you will give
[1:46:53] the best of who you are Amen to Jesus
[1:46:56] Christ amen amen you will you will count
[1:47:00] him worthy of your praise you'll count
[1:47:02] him of worthy of Praise You oh
[1:47:05] Hallelujah that list could just go on
[1:47:08] forever amen you count him worthy of
[1:47:11] your prayers you know when you won't
[1:47:13] pray what you're telling
[1:47:16] God think about
[1:47:20] it I'm not praying because if I pray it
[1:47:24] won't make any difference
[1:47:28] anyhow come on that's right well you can
[1:47:31] put any word you want to it I'm lazy I'm
[1:47:34] unmotivated I'm whatever it is but if
[1:47:37] you are persuaded my brother and sister
[1:47:39] that your prayer makes a difference then
[1:47:41] you will be lifting your prayer Before
[1:47:44] the Throne of God Amen if you are
[1:47:47] persuaded that reading your Bible makes
[1:47:49] a difference then you will be reading
[1:47:51] your Bible amen if you are persuaded
[1:47:54] that your praise and your worship makes
[1:47:57] a difference and the word says it comes
[1:47:59] as a sweet odor Before the Throne of
[1:48:01] almighty God if you're persuaded that
[1:48:03] your prayers are a sweet odor Before the
[1:48:06] Throne of God you will
[1:48:08] pray amen if you're persuaded my brother
[1:48:11] and sister that following the word of
[1:48:13] God being obedient to the word of God
[1:48:15] makes a difference then you will be
[1:48:17] obedient but people say well I believe
[1:48:19] this but I I'm not so sure about this
[1:48:23] and I could I could go for this but I I
[1:48:25] don't know about this that's what
[1:48:27] brother Brown said I'm not reading it as
[1:48:29] a quote to you but that's what he
[1:48:30] said amen but when you're persuaded and
[1:48:33] the word says you're going to say that
[1:48:35] was there for a purpose I'm going to be
[1:48:38] obedient to that oh and I see this oh
[1:48:41] over here even in the smallest of gifts
[1:48:43] coming to me I say thank you Lord for
[1:48:46] this good gift but brother Jones gave it
[1:48:48] to you I know but but God anointed
[1:48:50] brother Jones to give it to me so
[1:48:52] provided for brother Jones to me I say
[1:48:54] thank you Lord hallelujah when you're
[1:48:57] persuaded of these things Saints it will
[1:48:59] change our approach no no more
[1:49:02] half-hearted no more just kind of
[1:49:04] bumbling along we will stand and that oh
[1:49:06] I know I forgot I'm preaching the
[1:49:09] message of the fanatic excuse me let me
[1:49:12] get back to the average
[1:49:15] Church who wants to be
[1:49:19] average the average Church said um
[1:49:26] isn't Elijah supposed to
[1:49:30] come the average Church
[1:49:33] says you owe it to me to give me some
[1:49:36] oil in my
[1:49:41] lamp I almost preached a sermon here
[1:49:43] recently called The Selfish
[1:49:46] Christian that's what the world's going
[1:49:47] to call you they're going to call you
[1:49:50] selfish cuz you won't share your oil
[1:49:53] right that's exactly
[1:49:55] right but you see without going into it
[1:49:59] it's your oil that's right you're the
[1:50:02] one that prayed for it you're the one
[1:50:03] that labored for it you're the one that
[1:50:05] sacrificed for it you're the one that
[1:50:07] obeyed the word of God for that because
[1:50:10] why you were persuaded amen you didn't
[1:50:14] have a half-hearted approach to the word
[1:50:15] of the day amen you didn't just kind of
[1:50:18] go well you know this may or may not
[1:50:20] matter you decided it matter
[1:50:23] I'll come and move on with
[1:50:25] this God is worthy of our
[1:50:31] best I would thought I might get a
[1:50:33] Hallelujah out of somebody on
[1:50:38] that but here they're now up in this
[1:50:41] Upper Room in the presence of God then
[1:50:43] all of a sudden Here Comes This Holy
[1:50:44] Spirit down from heaven and it quickened
[1:50:46] them and the quickening took place
[1:50:49] and they wasn't afraid to make a witness
[1:50:52] of the message that they believed and
[1:50:53] know to be the truth otherwise they were
[1:50:56] afraid of it yes sir come on sir we can
[1:50:59] say Amen to
[1:51:01] that I can tell you my brother and
[1:51:03] sister many years ago driving truck
[1:51:06] setting into a truck stop one night and
[1:51:09] a man sat down at the table across from
[1:51:11] me I was all bummed out depressed lonely
[1:51:15] way you know way long ways from home and
[1:51:18] I I wasn't happy camper my own self and
[1:51:20] this man sits down after he's totally
[1:51:23] sat down he looks up at me and says oh I
[1:51:25] hope you don't mind me sitting
[1:51:28] here I didn't have the courage to tell
[1:51:30] him yes I do
[1:51:32] mind I just kind of went
[1:51:36] whatever then he proceeds to tell me
[1:51:39] about his daughter that's went
[1:51:41] haywire his son that's went haywire and
[1:51:44] a wife that was headed
[1:51:46] haywired and how he didn't even know how
[1:51:48] to relate to them and he realized that a
[1:51:50] lot of their problem was him and how he
[1:51:53] approached things and what was going on
[1:51:55] in his life and how that his grandmother
[1:51:57] took him to church when he was a young
[1:51:59] man and and how she tried to get him to
[1:52:02] keep going to church but he turned away
[1:52:04] from it because of
[1:52:07] friends yeah and here he was 45 or so
[1:52:11] years
[1:52:12] old and
[1:52:14] questioning what do I need to do to get
[1:52:16] my life straightened
[1:52:18] out and to my shame Saints
[1:52:23] I just spoke real vaguely to him well
[1:52:26] find you a
[1:52:27] church read your
[1:52:32] Bible it haunted me for
[1:52:35] years that I had an Open Door in front
[1:52:38] of
[1:52:39] me now what does he say right
[1:52:46] here this quickening made them where
[1:52:49] they wasn't
[1:52:50] afraid to make a wit of the
[1:52:53] message that they
[1:52:59] believed you cannot be persuaded
[1:53:03] Saints and not share this gospel amen
[1:53:08] amen all I could do after we had went
[1:53:11] our ways down the road I woke up the
[1:53:14] next day I looked around the man's truck
[1:53:17] he was
[1:53:18] gone I prayed Saints for years
[1:53:22] that that man would meet someone who had
[1:53:25] the
[1:53:26] courage to sit in a crowded truck stop
[1:53:30] and not care about all kinds of heathens
[1:53:32] and languages and whatever else and tell
[1:53:35] the man what he was searching for amen
[1:53:39] God help us amen amen amen hallelujah I
[1:53:43] I just want to say thank you Lord I I no
[1:53:45] longer have that Reserve cuz you figure
[1:53:48] out most everybody thinks you're weird
[1:53:50] anyway Hallelujah but that ain't the
[1:53:52] right that's not the excuse but they
[1:53:54] think you're weird anyway you know the
[1:53:55] first minute you speak you're a
[1:53:56] Christian and you go to church faithful
[1:53:58] and you believe Jesus Christ and you
[1:54:00] have the Holy Ghost they're just like oh
[1:54:02] okay but the one that you're speaking
[1:54:06] to that's the only one that matters the
[1:54:08] one you're speaking to amen amen Jesus
[1:54:11] never got to the woman at the well and
[1:54:13] said well now what we need to do is find
[1:54:15] out what the people in town think about
[1:54:17] you and then if they think well of you
[1:54:20] where you could go and share the this
[1:54:22] then I'm going to witness and give you
[1:54:24] Deliverance No all he cared about was
[1:54:26] her but when something happened to her
[1:54:29] she jumped up run down to town went
[1:54:32] running right through the town and says
[1:54:34] come and see come and see come and see
[1:54:36] the man that told me all about my
[1:54:38] life and some of them said she
[1:54:41] Something's Happened Here I think I'll
[1:54:43] wander up to the well just to see what
[1:54:45] it is she's rambling about that's right
[1:54:47] but she didn't just go and quietly
[1:54:49] changed she verbal it amen
[1:54:54] amen oh hallelujah sister Emmy would you
[1:54:57] come otherwise they're afraid of it how
[1:54:59] many Presbyterians how many methodists
[1:55:00] how many Baptists in the world today how
[1:55:02] many message Believers I mean how many
[1:55:04] Pentecostals that knows the truth and
[1:55:06] afraid to make a stand on it I'm
[1:55:09] persuaded to wonder what was that fell
[1:55:11] on you are you a part of his
[1:55:13] resurrection would you dare scream off
[1:55:15] for some man's Theory or
[1:55:18] idea
[1:55:21] h you know that would be like more of a
[1:55:23] modern
[1:55:27] day there might be some of you would
[1:55:31] be knowledged to this but quite a few
[1:55:34] years ago there was a man a church ended
[1:55:36] up in Durango
[1:55:38] [Music]
[1:55:42] Colorado Saints I only share this
[1:55:44] because it's like a burden that's still
[1:55:46] labors on my
[1:55:47] [Music]
[1:55:49] heart Drew all these people to him even
[1:55:52] come one day with a
[1:55:57] sword claimed that God placed that in
[1:55:59] his
[1:56:02] hand they had the word of the Lord thus
[1:56:04] sayith the Lord all other Ministry all
[1:56:08] other messages all other whatever were
[1:56:10] all faults he was commissioned to take
[1:56:13] the bride in
[1:56:16] Rapture I won't go into it things happen
[1:56:19] things go down the road God opened the
[1:56:21] door one day I went through their town
[1:56:23] in the semi in the middle of the
[1:56:25] winter I was friends with this young man
[1:56:28] and I stopped and we went out to
[1:56:32] [Music]
[1:56:33] eat he pressed upon me persuaded
[1:56:37] me to spend the night in their home
[1:56:40] instead of sleeping in the
[1:56:43] truck and that evening as we're sitting
[1:56:46] there he offered me he says I I've been
[1:56:50] given by this brother I've been given
[1:56:53] this commission to extend to
[1:56:57] you you see they believed it was all
[1:57:00] over that only those that were in and
[1:57:03] their little belief was
[1:57:05] in but my invitation only they could
[1:57:09] extend a position in the bride of Christ
[1:57:12] to me and my wife and my children by me
[1:57:18] accepting their offer
[1:57:20] [Music]
[1:57:25] sounded
[1:57:26] [Music]
[1:57:29] good it's all finished no more sin no
[1:57:34] Behavior no thoughts no Deeds held
[1:57:37] against you it's all
[1:57:39] finished live any way you
[1:57:42] please sounded good didn't it we can
[1:57:45] just go out and live any old way call
[1:57:48] ourselves the bride of Christ
[1:57:52] and he laid this whole thing out Saints
[1:57:54] and I'm not making light of this my
[1:57:55] heart Grieves in fact sister Jerry uh
[1:57:58] could tell you that I just brought it up
[1:58:00] off my heart a couple days
[1:58:03] ago he lays it all out the reasons why I
[1:58:07] should do
[1:58:11] this and all I could do is look at him
[1:58:14] and say show it to me in the
[1:58:16] scripture that's all that's going to
[1:58:18] matter if you can show this to me in the
[1:58:21] scripture I'll look at it otherwise I'm
[1:58:23] not
[1:58:25] interested and he
[1:58:26] said words it's a
[1:58:32] revelation then I did my best Saints
[1:58:35] round two I got my did my best to
[1:58:38] persuade him go back to the word go back
[1:58:41] to the Bible go back to the message
[1:58:43] stand on that go back to the
[1:58:45] original did you know brother
[1:58:48] sisters it's never an easy path we have
[1:58:51] to walk
[1:58:53] it's not I I say it's never easy God
[1:58:56] anointed I say this is the Lord I sure
[1:58:58] wouldn't have said it in my own flesh I
[1:59:00] said some very very very strong words to
[1:59:03] him that night and I closed it out with
[1:59:07] what might seem to be rude I closed it
[1:59:09] out
[1:59:19] with if that's what you think is the
[1:59:22] [Music]
[1:59:23] truth this is
[1:59:26] the we've all been
[1:59:29] deceived do you know this man who had
[1:59:31] this great gift of
[1:59:33] God about 3 years later ran off with my
[1:59:36] friend's wife destroyed his family took
[1:59:39] all of his money everything just cleaned
[1:59:41] the clock on him you think that made me
[1:59:43] happy see I was right see I was right no
[1:59:46] my heart Grieves Amen to this day it
[1:59:50] Grieves amen and I tried to reconcile
[1:59:53] him after that tried to do that and he
[1:59:55] won't even answer a phone if I call him
[1:59:58] I'm done I'm finished I'm out of his
[2:00:00] thoughts but you see brothers and
[2:00:02] sisters we got to come down to a
[2:00:06] time where we're fully persuaded amen
[2:00:10] there's no room for nothing else to be
[2:00:12] placed in there and I say nothing else
[2:00:14] there's always room for more Revelation
[2:00:15] from the Lord but I'm talking about any
[2:00:17] man's ideas we come down we're fully
[2:00:20] persuaded this is what God sent for this
[2:00:22] this is what he called but I've got a
[2:00:24] brother I've got a sister I've got a
[2:00:26] cousin I've got a mom a dad I've got a
[2:00:27] child that says this is nonsense that's
[2:00:30] fine that's their Revelation what did
[2:00:32] God speak to you instead of sitting
[2:00:34] there and trying to figure out what
[2:00:36] they're saying whether it's right or
[2:00:37] wrong why don't you go back to the word
[2:00:38] of God become fully persuaded that this
[2:00:42] word is Right amen but you scare scream
[2:00:46] off on some man's Theory or idea or have
[2:00:48] you got the real boldness and the real
[2:00:50] manhood it takes to stand out call right
[2:00:52] right and wrong wrong are you a part of
[2:00:56] the Resurrection or are you a worshipper
[2:00:59] of a bunch of Creeds are you a goer to
[2:01:01] church do you have your name on there
[2:01:04] and dead in sin and trespasses he that
[2:01:06] believes not the full word of God is a
[2:01:08] sinner did you catch that the full word
[2:01:12] of God those Pharisees believed in many
[2:01:15] things to be truth they said we are
[2:01:17] God's children and they were until that
[2:01:19] word was preached but when that word was
[2:01:21] preached preached and Vindicated then
[2:01:23] they become Sinners for rejecting the
[2:01:25] thing that they knowed was right and
[2:01:27] witness that we know thou are a teacher
[2:01:29] come from God and no man can do the
[2:01:30] things that you do without God being
[2:01:32] with you and I wonder today where are we
[2:01:36] at I ask you where is this Resurrection
[2:01:38] finding us are you D to step out are you
[2:01:42] D to take God at his words if you're
[2:01:44] ordained to life you surely will do it
[2:01:47] if you're an eagle that's me Hallelujah
[2:01:52] you can't help doing it there is
[2:01:54] something in you or do you want to just
[2:01:56] serve a Creed somewhere and say I go to
[2:01:58] church I'm just as good as you are if
[2:02:01] somebody give me 20 bucks for every time
[2:02:03] I have heard that I would take youall
[2:02:05] for lunch
[2:02:08] today see if I hold no birthrights
[2:02:11] you'll never see it if you hold no
[2:02:13] birthrights you'll never see it you
[2:02:15] can't see it but if you do hold
[2:02:17] possession of this Birthright you can't
[2:02:19] help from seeing it because it's part of
[2:02:22] you and you're part of it hallelujah
[2:02:27] hallelujah I'll tell you today Saints I
[2:02:31] am fully persuaded that I am a part of
[2:02:35] it and it is a part of me Hallelujah I'm
[2:02:40] not interested in some guy's version
[2:02:42] that they heard over a a table in a
[2:02:45] restaurant I'm not interested in who
[2:02:47] said what when where and how what I'm
[2:02:50] interested is and I I say this politely
[2:02:53] bring this
[2:02:55] out bring this
[2:02:57] out this is our
[2:03:00] absolute this is what I'm persuaded
[2:03:03] of
[2:03:05] Hallelujah now this come out a little
[2:03:07] different you know what I preached this
[2:03:08] to myself in the office this morning I
[2:03:10] was a lot happier than I seem to be
[2:03:12] right now but my brother and sister it
[2:03:14] actually this word makes me happy
[2:03:17] because when I recognize that it's not
[2:03:19] my understanding my knowledge my
[2:03:21] reasoning but it's the anointing of God
[2:03:23] that keeps pulling me back to the word
[2:03:26] amen I tell you I I I I I don't want to
[2:03:29] sound like I have any thing more than
[2:03:30] any of you do but I just have my
[2:03:33] experience I just have what I've been
[2:03:34] through life what I've seen how it's
[2:03:36] come about the things that I thought oh
[2:03:38] and start to go a certain direction and
[2:03:40] it seemed like God cut it off and then
[2:03:42] I'd be almost like all hurt you know
[2:03:44] like well well uh uh and then go over
[2:03:47] here and God cut it off and God cut it
[2:03:50] off and then I woke woke up one day and
[2:03:52] said thank you Lord for cutting it off
[2:03:55] because you see God said I'll lead you
[2:03:57] and guide you now I know this is a silly
[2:03:59] analogy forgive me you guys know how I
[2:04:01] am but I'm telling you my brother and
[2:04:03] sister when you lead someone as it were
[2:04:08] an animal or
[2:04:09] whatever you know they might wander a
[2:04:12] little bit to the leash this way and a
[2:04:15] little bit to the leash this way I tell
[2:04:18] you I guess I could use our Teddy dog
[2:04:19] for an example and that would be you're
[2:04:22] holding on to the leash and it's
[2:04:25] like but ultimately my brother and
[2:04:27] sister God's got the leash on
[2:04:30] us oh that don't sound very good you
[2:04:32] were predestinated that's right God knew
[2:04:35] that when he anointed you you would
[2:04:37] follow that's right oh Hallelujah don't
[2:04:40] you love uh predestination amen he
[2:04:42] didn't say I'm going to make them follow
[2:04:45] Hallelujah I'm going to make my dog walk
[2:04:47] in exact
[2:04:48] Footprints no you don't but the truth is
[2:04:51] God put a leash on us long time ago for
[2:04:54] the foundation of the world he said I'm
[2:04:56] not worried about you getting away I
[2:04:58] know right where you're going to end up
[2:05:01] hallelujah oh let's sing a song or two
[2:05:03] brother Jason come
[2:05:07] Hallelujah my I'm sorry I hope this
[2:05:09] didn't come across Chompy but you see
[2:05:10] when you got a sermon and you got so
[2:05:12] much stuff and then you got to bring out
[2:05:13] the prunes and start cutting
[2:05:16] away yeah cuz I'm trying to break this
[2:05:19] bad reputation
[2:05:22] but I tell you what my brother and
[2:05:23] sisters there's something I won't break
[2:05:25] and that's the leadership of the Holy
[2:05:26] Ghost let's stay with that leadership
[2:05:29] let's not let any influence of man let's
[2:05:31] not let our carnal life here well I got

[2:05:44] hallelujah so let's just set ourselves
[2:05:46] up for a Rapture not set ourselves up

[2:08:06] I'm con I'm persuaded Saints I'm
[2:08:08] persuaded that's why sometimes you'll
[2:08:10] see brother Paul maybe looks a little
[2:08:11] silly I get a little excited my brother
[2:08:14] and sister the reason is I'm persuaded
[2:08:15] and the reality of what I'm seeing of
[2:08:18] what I'm persuaded of is so beyond on
[2:08:21] this world that's right it is so beyond
[2:08:24] what I
[2:08:26] experience you know
[2:08:29] what for headed I don't know post 30
[2:08:33] years or so I've been putting seed in
[2:08:35] the ground as a
[2:08:37] farmer had a young man one time asked me
[2:08:40] a question young Christian
[2:08:42] believer he said brother Paul when you
[2:08:45] put that seed in the ground how do you
[2:08:49] know it's going to to
[2:08:52] [Music]
[2:08:54] grow well son let me explain to you
[2:08:59] bioscience we have germplasm we have
[2:09:03] starch we have all these different
[2:09:05] membranes and different things that I
[2:09:07] can't even pronounce them correctly and
[2:09:10] uh what we're going to do is now talk
[2:09:12] about how that the skin of a corn seed
[2:09:15] draws moisture it doesn't sit and wait
[2:09:18] for moisture it draws moisture
[2:09:23] H anyway so we preach part two here this
[2:09:30] morning smart young
[2:09:32] man I said her you can hear the other
[2:09:35] side and he said I want to hear the
[2:09:37] other
[2:09:40] side the
[2:09:41] life is in the seed that's
[2:09:45] right you know how you check germ on
[2:09:48] corn you got corn that's been in a bag
[2:09:50] maybe carried over from the next year
[2:09:51] you want to make sure it's
[2:09:53] good you take an egg crate kids it's
[2:09:56] actually a really cool science project
[2:09:58] I'll get you corn seed if you want to do
[2:10:00] it you take an egg crate and you put a
[2:10:02] cotton ball in the
[2:10:04] bottom you put a corn seed on top of it
[2:10:07] you don't even have to put a cotton ball
[2:10:08] on top of it but it's best or a wet
[2:10:10] paper towel and then you just keep it
[2:10:12] wet it don't even have
[2:10:15] dirt it don't even have dirt did you get
[2:10:18] that it don't even have dirt but because
[2:10:21] there's life in it it will grow amen
[2:10:24] hallelujah pretty cool cuz if you keep
[2:10:27] it the right atmosphere the right
[2:10:28] temperature it will put out a whole root
[2:10:31] and start to sprout just like it would
[2:10:33] if it was in the right atmosphere but I
[2:10:35] tell you what if you don't get it out
[2:10:37] denominational egg crate quick enough
[2:10:40] find some real soil to put it in it's

[2:14:30] come and start to speak the words to try
[2:14:33] to persuade
[2:14:35] you I don't care what that man or that
[2:14:37] woman

[2:16:08] that you're gambling
[2:16:09] [Music]
[2:16:13] with reminds me of a cowboy Story Once A
[2:16:16] man was
[2:16:17] gambling laid everything he owned but
[2:16:20] his Spurs on the table and they said
[2:16:21] why'd you keep the Spurs but got rid of
[2:16:23] your horse he said I might find another
[2:16:24] horse
[2:16:25] [Music]
[2:16:27] someday well wait why didn't he keep the
[2:16:29] horse he could find some spurs
[2:16:32] someday or better yet why didn't he keep
[2:16:35] his money and forget about all of
[2:16:39] that but you see in the
[2:16:42] moment in the
[2:16:44] moment you see the CO's coming Saints in
[2:16:47] another wave through the message
[2:16:51] the
[2:16:51] [Music]
[2:16:53] virus and it makes all these cute little
[2:16:56] videos they're well fought out they're
[2:16:59] well done and they lay out these
[2:17:02] facts what is
[2:17:05] fact what is fact
[2:17:08] Saints I'll tell you
[2:17:13] what I'm going to fact check
[2:17:18] it if it won't P pass the test have
[2:17:20] courage enough to look at that person
[2:17:23] tell them they need to find an altar
[2:17:24] somewhere they need to go back to the
[2:17:26] word of God and quit looking for
[2:17:28] something fabulous looking for something
[2:17:31] new something more
[2:17:33] spectacular you say where you getting at

[2:17:44] Christ now I want you to fact check it
[2:17:47] and see whether they're pointing you to
[2:17:48] Christ or not

[2:17:53] convince you to step away from but where
[2:17:56] are they taking you that's
