Lord Jesus will'll pass any laws Lord will go beyond anything of this world Lord Jesus we love you father and thank you in Jesus Christ's name we pray amen amen Nehemiah chapter 2 it's good to be in the house of God tonight always a privilege and an honor amen I sat down to uh put some notes together and um it was like I hit a gas line or a cut a water pipe just yeah beautiful overflowed so I quickly just threw it all on the pages um leave it up to the Lord to sort it out amen that's the best place a preacher can be is completely Reliant upon the Lord amen Nehemiah 2:1 17 then said I unto them you see the distress that we are in how Jerusalem lieth waste and the gates thereof are burned with fire come and let us build up the wall of Jerusalem that we be no more a reproach then I told them of the hand of my God which was good upon me as also the king's words that he had spoken unto me and they said let us rise up and build so they strengthened their hands for this good work but when s balot the horonite and toah the servant the ammonite and gesim the Arabian heard it they laughed us to scorn and despite us despised us the critics and said what is this thing that you do will ye rebel against the king then answered I them and said unto them the god of Heaven he will prosper us therefore we his servants will arise and build but ye have no portion nor right nor Memorial in Jerusalem the enemy has no rights that's and no no Memorial you came from God you're going back to God so you have a memorial in Jerusalem because God has remembered you because you were there to begin with the Enemy was not the enemy has no Memorial right amen Acts chapter 7 verse 47 but Solomon built him in house this is Steven before the San hedrin he's PR preaching to them it's amazing what God can do with a human being here he is facing death and he's calling them Snakes in the Grass or stiff necked uncircumcised in heart the word of God is Not Afraid and the Holy Spirit will take full control of you in in the time of need but Solomon built him in house how be it the most high verse 48 how be it the most high dwelleth not in temples made with hands as saith the prophet Heaven is my throne and Earth is my foot stol what house will you build me sayeth the Lord or what is the place of my rest hath not my hand made all these things ye stick necked and uncircumcised in heart and ears you do always resist the Holy Ghost as your fathers did so do ye may the Lord add a blessing to the reading of his word you may be seated tonight my title tonight is aise and build amen my subtitle is bethl we know that bethl means the house of God praise the Lord so we read here in the scripture Stephen is saying that the Lord is looking for a house to dwell in he doesn't dwell in Temple made with hands he now has come to dwell in a people amen that's what Calvary was the change of dispensations now the Holy Ghost is given freely we no longer need the temple on the Earth but he's looking for temple for a place to live a house to live in amen so you amen filled with the Holy Spirit are bethl the house of God Amen and so we read in Nehemiah that um they're build rebuilding the walls of Jerusalem I tell myself every time I'm not going to roll up my sleeves or take off my jacket and I do both praise the Lord amen so Nehemiah went back to Jerusalem to begin building the walls the uh for for ease of speech I'm going to call them the enemy because I cannot repeat those names from memory but the enemy is is uh coming against Nehemiah and the guys there that are working on Jerusalem and um they're afraid that's why the enemy attacks you you know that it's because he's afraid so they're afraid they see Jerusalem being built back up right that they're over there in Syria or Samaria and uh they've got things pretty good right they're buddies but buddy buddies with Nebuchadnezzar but then um or Babylon because this was exes at this time but but then now there's this uh rebuilding of Jerusalem they thought they were in with the bosses in Babylon and then here comes along this news they did not get word of Amen Nehemiah while he's handing the cup to the king that the king says Nehemiah you look distressed and we'll read this and he says oh oh King uh you know let let forgive me for speaking freely but my heart is burdened for Jerusalem so the king gives him a note gives him some time off and sends him to Jerusalem and so now there's a threat being built up why because the walls of Jerusalem are being built again and so the Lord is is is coming back this is after the 70 weeks of Daniel and now it's being built back up because God is once again in favor of his of his children and uh but to to to get to to that point we need to just step back in history a little bit to the fall of Jerusalem turn with me to 2 Kings chapter 25 praise the Lord 2 Kings chapter 25 if you'll notice if you want to go back this evening or tomorrow in your devotions you can read just a couple chapters before this is when Josiah is King so just you know he restores the the temple restores the word he asks the priest to come read it and there there's a time of restoration a time of returning of the word but yet because there was yet not something that could instill within a man's heart that could keep him from sinning or keep him from from angering God and and because the law as we know was impossible to keep and U and a man would fall by the law so God his great plan was to send us Grace and the blood of Jesus Christ and so you see just after Josiah is King we see the end of jerus Jem in this point in history and um 2 Kings 25 verse 1 and it came to pass in the 9th year and this is 10 verses so bear with me of his reign in the 10th month in the 10th day of the month that Nebuchadnezzar King of Babylon came he and all his host now he is returning back if you go into the beginning of chapter 24 just after the death of the King after Josiah uh it says that jeho Kim became Nebuchadnezzar's servant for three years then he rebelled against him so somewhere in there there was a pact made or something and you forgive me if my history is incorrect but now he Rebels against them so Nebuchadnezzar comes and um he uh besieges the city and so forth but then but Jerusalem's Still Standing there's still a king and so that's where we pick up here and so in the 10th month the 10th day of the month that Nebuchadnezzar King of Babylon came he and all his host against Jerusalem because zedekiah rebelled against the king of Babylon there we go and the city was besieged oh excuse me and all his host against Jerusalem and pitched against it and they built forts against it round about so they were planning on staying as long as necessary amen the enemy has come in and camped about the city and the city was besieged unto the 11th year of King zedekiah and on the n9th day of the fourth month the famine prevailed in the city and there was no bread for the people of the land and the city was broken up and all the men of War fled By Night by the way of the gate between two walls which is by the King's Garden now the chales were against the city round about and the King went the way toward the plane now if I'm correct Jeremiah gave told zedekiah to give himself to Nebuchadnezzar and all would be well but zedekiah refused to obey that word from the Lord and he ran and this is what happens here and the army of the chales pursued after the king and overtook him in the plains of Jericho and all his army were scattered from him so they took the king and brought him up to the king of Babylon to riblah and they gave judgment upon him and they slew the sons of zedekiah before his eyes and then put out the eyes of zedekiah and bound him with feather feds of brass and carried him to Babylon and in the fifth month on the seventh day of the month which is the 19th year of the of King Nebuchadnezzar King of Babylon came nebu zaran captain of the Guard a servant of the king of Babylon unto jerus Jerusalem and he burnt the house of the Lord and the King's house and all the houses of Jerusalem and every great man's house burnt he with fire and all the army of the chis that were with the captain of the Guard Break Down The Walls of Jerusalem round about and so from there on that from that point in history for we see Daniel and the the the the three Hebrew children and the 70 weeks of Daniel up to Ezra and Nehemiah and so um Nehemiah comes to a place so first of all the children of Israel stepped out from behind the will of God I have a quote I'm going to skip ahead to it brother brandham says in the angel of the Lord 1951 when Israel got out of the will of God they suffered for it we will too so you be reverent and remember that now amen amen that's straight and that's not to scare you as to say because the Lord is gracious and he will give you a little spanking and get you back in behind his will but there's places in the message where it says that brother BR says that if you the devil can't get to you step till you step out from behind the will of God and so the children of Israel stepped out into this place and we see the destroying of the walls of Jerusalem if we pick this story up in Nehemiah chapter 1 we have a few scriptures we're just turning back and forth to tonight but apparent maybe you guys some of you need to practice where's Nehemiah again Nehemiah 1 verse 1 the words of Nehemiah the son of hakah and it came came to pass in the month just SL in the 20th year as I was in Shu shushan the palace that hananiah one of my brethren came he and certain men of J Judah and I asked them concerning the Jews that had escaped which were left of the Captivity and concerning Jerusalem and they said unto me the remnant that are left of the Captivity there in in the province are in great Affliction and approach the wall of Jerusalem also is broken down and the Gates thereof are burned with fire and it came to pass when I heard these words that I sat down and wept and mourned certain days and fasted and prayed before the god of heaven so Nehemiah gets this news and he's he's stricken down because his home Jerusalem is in Ruins uh those that are there that are living there that are surviving are underneath great Affliction and uh he he he he he's weeping over this and he's praying to the god of heaven and you can read his prayer there but he's beseeching the Lord he's saying Lord you know keep the Covenant and and mercy for so he says in verse 5 he say and I beseech thee Oh Lord God Of Heaven the great and terrible God that keepeth Covenant and mercy for them that love him and observe his Commandments let thine ear now be attentive and that eyes open that thou mayest hear the prayer of thy servant which I pray before thee now day and night for the children of Israel thy servants anden I guess we're going to read the prayer and confess the sins of the children of Israel which we have sinned against thee both I and my father's house have sinned so he goes on to say we've dealt corruptly and all these things and he says in verse 11 oh Lord I beseech you let now thine ear be attented to the prayer of thy servant and the prayer of thy servants who desire to fear who desire to fear thy name and prosper I pray thee thy servant this day and Grant him Mercy in the sight of this man for I was the king's cup Bearer so he's saying he's beseeching the Lord say give me favor with the King that I may ask to go back to Jerusalem to begin to rebuild and um there on a little bit further he he's before the king and um so God sends Nehemiah back and Nehemiah has instructions he has a certificate that he's allowed to start building from the King but it was a secret thing and so he goes back and he begins to he he he goes back with some delegates of Babylon and in the middle of the night he Saddles up his horse and he goes and he inspects the city and he says he says he did this in the night so they that were with him wouldn't know what he was doing so not only the king sounds like knew Nehemiah was his desire was to rebuild the walls of Jerusalem everyone else thought he was just going there to check things out and visit it but we see here that Nehemiah begins to rebuild the walls of Jerusalem and there's a a great list of everyone that pitched in and helped and um everyone took their place around the city they begin to rebuild the walls and they rebuil they were rebuilding the walls of Jerusalem against adversity and the Ws of the enemy the the enemy was coming at them from all sides they started with with threats they started with laughing and scorning them as I said they were the critics amen but as we heard the critic doesn't matter amen and so and so they're they're there they're working and and in verse chapter 4 it says and and conspired all of them to Nehemiah 4:8 conspired all of them to get to come and to fight against Jerusalem and to hinder it 4:1 15 and it came to pass when our enemies heard that it was known unto us and God had brought their counsel to not that we returned all of us to the wall everyone unto his work so they continued to build and they kept guard the men that were building that were working had their sword on their side and then there was the other half of them were standing roundabout guarding those that were working with The Sword and the spear and the different weapons of warfare they were on their guard as they were were rebuilding the City Jerusalem and uh we I'm going to pick read it again for remembrance we read at the beginning 7 uh Nehemiah 2:20 then answered I them and said unto them the god of Heaven he will prosper us therefore we his servants will arise and build that's where I get my title from but ye have no portion nor right nor Memorial in Jerusalem the devil has no right to your city the devil has no right or Memorial to your city God before the foundation of the world s handpicked you selected you to be here today to hear the news of today to to be caught up in this world excuse me caught in this world and but he has given you an an anointing he has given you the power and he's telling you to rise and build amen you are the house of God so we as Christians must continue to build while being on guard against the ATT the attacks of the enemy amen we get attacked sometimes we lose a couple of bricks maybe we lose a whole section of the wall and but God is saying rise up and build because he desires that you be the house of God Amen praise the lord we must fortify our families our personal walk with the Lord our Brethren around us boy that's where the devil lik to get in god starts to get you to talk about somebody else to spread rumors amen you you you've seen the the the funny stories right it starts off over here you know uh Paul Paul Johnny caught his finger and it gets 10 people down and Johnny cut his finger off amen the word goes through gossip goes through and then things grow and things get out of hand if they never would have said anything or gossiped about anything like that amen that would have never happened and so we're called to support and fortify the Brethren around us and the body of Believers that we serve with amen amen you are not just a called to sit on the Pew here at Grace Tabernacle you're are called to be a part of that sometimes that means calling up and say Hey brother I didn't see you in church is everything okay is all well I had a preacher one time I don't remember his who it was but he said you hear somebody who stopped going to church you call him and you he basically said you chew them out you tell them they you they know where they're supposed to be and why aren't they there and what's going on because the devil sneaks in and he likes to to get people off and say you know no one understands your problems no one knows how you feel and then and then if we're not careful you know we we don't shake their hand not meeting anything by it but the devil slips in and says see you don't belong here you're you're not you're not here and then your friends out over here in maybe another church that's not so well or maybe or maybe out in the world at work in the workplace those friends you start to get more friends right the devil's pulling you pulling you away see you don't belong over there at that church you don't belong with those people you belong over here look how well you fit in if you're fitting in with the world you need to arise and build your wall right praise the Lord there's a concept my do my um daughter was learning and as was a bucket Dipper or a bucket filler meaning if you uh call someone names well then you're a bucket Dipper you're taking from that person but if you encourage them you're a bucket filler this is kind of funny because a picked it up and he Lena you're being a bucket Dipper but I ask you tonight are you a builder or a destroyer are you helping your brother see see every every every available family was working on the walls of Jerusalem they rebuilt the walls in 52 days of a big city why because they all did their part they all stepped up they they didn't they didn't worry about their own houses when you get to the the end of this of this what they did they it says None of the houses were were repaired yet they spent all their time right they weren't they weren't selfish in trying to to hold hoard their time into their own self if they would have done that guess what they would have never got the walls of then it wouldn't matter if they had an nice's house on the Block but they all stepped up to their position they all arose and begin to build up Jerusalem and the walls around it because those that was the very thing that would bring them the protection that they needed against the enemy many times we're we get caught up and we're building up our house so to speak within the walls and um we're making sure our job is well taken care of and we're making sure we have that nice Lexus or that nice BMW or that nice Mercedes or that lifted Ford or or that uh lifted Chevy excuse me and um if we're not careful we get caught up in that and our walls go to shambles around us and um it's the very thing that you're you're putting your time and your effort into that's not of God that's not now you need that something there nothing wrong with a nice truck cuz one day I by God's grace I might pull up in one and I don't want you to say you're a hypocrite everybody wants a nice Tru there's nothing wrong with that but if you're forsaking your walk with the Lord for that then maybe you ought to go with a little Dodge Neon for us some people like those I can't say Toyota [Laughter] Prius Lord bless you amen amen praise the Lord I love you brother David amen so what's your focus that's that is that my desire tonight is to to to maybe maybe the Lord has brought this along because you need to refocus where are you building what are you building up are you are you are you are you building up your career are you building up your personal finances um excuse me are you more interested in money um are are are you are you letting your money rule your life amen or are you taking as good stewards of that and putting it to the use for the kingdom of God Amen are you building up those around you in the Lord or are you tearing down the walls of your brothers you are called and anointed to be a house of God and to maintain a the walls around you in good standing praise the Lord that is what keeps the enemy out now brother brandom says in um the Ephesian Church age he says now why did this have to be so why was it that the seed of the serpent must come this way Man was created for God man was to be the temple of God the place of God's rest the Holy Spirit was the place of God's rest the Holy Spirit was man so in man the temple he reads acts 7: 46:51 we'll pick up after that Satan has known this all along he also wants to indwell man even as God so does but God has reserved to himself that right Satan cannot do that God Alone appeared in human flesh Satan could not and cannot do that he does not have creative Powers the only way for Satan to accomplish what he wanted to do was to enter the serpent in Eden even as he entered by evil spirits into the swine at go gadara God does not enter an animal but Satan can and will to accomplish his ends he could not have a child directly by Eve as God did by Mary so he entered into the serpent and then beguiled Eve he seduced her and by her did Satan have a child vicariously Cain bore the full spiritual characteristics of Satan and he goes on and he says no wonder the holy spirit said that Cain was of that Wicked one he was so Man was created for God that the enemy cannot he says here um that God has reserved the right for himself to indwell in man and the enemy cannot do that but what happened was Eve Let Down the Walls amen a a word came and that word was contrary to the word of God and anything contrary to the word of God has one intent and that is to break down your wall amen now those attacks come and walls have to be kept in repair but what happened was Eve let the enemy slip in and because of that now we have flesh what we have to deal with but even then it was all part of God's great plan amen Man was created for God to be otherwise is destruction you see someone who is who in the world they're they're they're influenced and they they're anointed of the devil it brings destruction on their life it brings destruction on their bodies physically you see a deterioration why because man was not created to be anointed like that what happened to Cain right amen and and and Cain Cain went out and now we have you know all this this problems in the world because of what happened there in the garden of the E of Eden I lost my train thought there forgive me but God desires to dwell inside of man and we are a house built for him amen Matthew 7:2 24-27 says therefore whosoever heareth these sayings of mine and doth them I will liken him unto a wise man which built his house upon a rock so what gives you the ability to arise and build and keep fortified it is the word of God you don't have to physically start putting bricks around your house if you did people would be wondering where's your building permit and what you're doing and um they would call you crazy but they already do so that's all right amen but when you hear the word of God it is the word of God that builds up your walls but yet you are called as an individual as a son or daughter of God to rise up to take your place to do your part guess what the children of Israel still had to cross over Jordan themselves God didn't lift them up and carry them across so to speak he provided the way but first the priest had to step into the water first the children the three Hebrew children had to step into the fire amen before God came along and paved the way and when when God when God parted the Waters of the River Jordan amen he was giving he was he was surrounding them with his protection when he sent them into the promised land to begin to take it and to begin to defeat the enemies just like you are doing God has anointed you and given you what you need to fight against that amen and what is the very first thing that children of Israel did when they crossed into their promised they tore down some walls amen that's the first thing you did when you received Jesus Christ as your savior and God filled you with the Holy Ghost it was time now to bring down those walls but guess what you can't do it on your own maybe there's a Jericho in your life it doesn't have to be something crazy and something weird it could be something as simple as Pride or something as simple as your job is now coming before your walk with the Lord or or your nice truck is coming before you have a Jericho in your life amen amen it's now time for you to what all they did was March around it and then they worshiped they yelled they blew the trumpets they yelled in Victory while the walls were still standing but it was that Declaration of Victory which is what a test of faith that brought the walls down you show God that you are willing to to look foolish yeah and then Shou in Victory when there's still an enemy that's right amen and he says okay I'll bring those walls down they if they would have tried to do it on their own if they would have built great Machines of warfare and tried to bring it down guess what they would have been totally defeated but because Joshua took the word of the Lord and then acted upon that amen the children of Israel received the victory but then sin came in the camp with Ain something in the walls wasn't right the enemy slipped in because one man went against God's word amen anything in your life that goes against God's word is hindering the strength of your walls that's right amen praise the Lord the rains will descend the floods will come the winds will blow and beat upon the house but it will fall not for it is founded upon the rock which is what a revelation of Jesus Christ that's why that is so so so important and why the devil hates it so much because it is that Revelation that will hold you in the storm amen that's right it is that Revelation that Revelation is that is revelation is the stone amen the holy spirit is the mortar that's right praise the Lord you can't have one without the other there is no wall without the Holy Spirit and revelation of the word of God because those two go hand in hand amen God gives you the Holy Ghost upon your faith as a confirmation of the faith you have but what is faith faith is revelation so Satan will tear down the walls of Jerusalem he cannot dwell unless the walls are torn down so he is always attacking them amen why doesn't he attack the drunk on the street there ain't no walls that's right why does he attack you because you've got a nice fortified City amen if you quit building and fortifying your walls will be penetrated you finish it right just as this is the type of the parable of the man that cleaned his house you finish the walls man they're looking nice I mean they are thick you can run three Chariots of breast around them you got big beams in the doors a big old bar across to lock it but then you sat back and you thought I have arrived oh Lord help us you have never arrived right you are never too you have you have never had too too many years in the message to go to the altar that's right you have never had too many years in the message to repent to someone and ask for forgiveness you have never had too many years in the message to not be moved by the word of God when it's being preached and show some emotion you're not called to sit in the back because you have arrived that's right you're no different than a Pharisee you have arrived to blindness to your own problems is what you've done amen and what happens you sit back you take a break you go to the Bahamas not actually and your walls start to fall apart that's right cuz guess what there's no work being put into it amen you're not maintaining it man Zig Ziggler he was an inspirational speaker and a Christian had a lot of good stuff he says I recommend he says inspiration is very important I recommend a daily dose you can't just hear something really good or or go to a really good service and be good forever why because the effects that that has upon you the effects a morning devotion or a time in prayer or a tape listen to has upon you as soon as you receive that effect and you're strengthen the devil starts going at you that's it at you and it will deteriorate if you don't continue to add to continue to add to to that and that is fortifying the walls around you you that's it so remember why did the walls of Jerusalem get destroyed in the first place the children of Israel got out of the will of God anytime right anytime you are not spending time with the Lord every single day you're technically out of the will of God God has called you to a close relationship with him anything that that comes between it and you now don't you don't want to take this overboard because we live in the world don't quit your job that's right get up earlier amen I got free pointing back at me on that one stay up later yes sir some of you know don't you already stay up later enough I'm just kidding I'm kidding sorry that was Chris forgive me so had they stayed with the Lord and kept their walls fortified they would have never fallen we see under the rule of of Josiah it was peace right of strength because they were bringing the word back it is our neglect that causes the walls of our city to fall that's right that's right you say well well well you know we're supposed to just wait upon the Lord be still and know that I'm a go I am God that is scripture but just like lots of other scripture it can be taken out of context be still does not mean give up that's right on doing your apart and do nothing that's it that's exactly you know okay natural types of spiritual what happens if a man just sits and does nothing he loses all strength he gets soft he gets grumpy he gets fat yes and hungry for junk food we are called how do you possess what are you called to do possess how do you possess footsteps action you are being called to action arise and build guess what Nehemiah if he never would have went to Jerusalem if he never would have got everyone to start building the walls there would have never been any walls you say well well well Jerusalem was was part of God's plan and it's the children of Israel yes but you have to do your part amen praise the Lord you have to do your part so we must arise and build can we talk about this without going to James chapter 2 James chapter 2 verse 14 what doth it profit my brethren though a man say he hath faith and ha not works can Faith save him they say oh brother you're trying to make us all Catholics no their their works are done in in uh unbelief right their Works do not testify of Christ their worth worth excuse me their Works testify of religion that's right I wish I had that quote my wife FR me the other day it was some blanket statement saying you know uh religion is called to bring us all together religion is is is is being kind to one another and loving everyone and not excluding people and all this stuff and I said you're right religion is called to do that but Christ said I come to bring division between a mother and his her son or son and his father that's where people misunderstand Christ that's right brother R says when when Jesus braided that Whip and beat the money changers out of the temple that was compassion go out on the street tomorrow go to Starbucks and ask the person checking ask the tell her what does compassion mean praise God that's right but why do they hate it so much because they the spirit that they're under hates the spirit of Christ exactly man is funny because we just change definitions of words that's right we decide that this word is is just you know it's it's just too rude we're going to change what it means or or it's it's too like salty we are called the children of God to be salty guess what being salty means nowadays you're cantankerous you're grumpy you're offended amen you think oh it's silly that's funny but it's the devil that's exactly right because now you say I'm salty people laugh and say oh are you feeling grumpy no I'm feeling anointed of the Holy Ghost amen James chapter 2:14 uh 15 if a brother or sister be naked and destitute of daily food and one of you say unto them depart in peace be ye warmed and filled notwithstanding you give them not those things which are needful to the body what do it profit even so faith if it ha not works is dead being alone that's right yeah a man may say thou Hast faith and I have Works show me thy faith without thy works and I will show you show thee my faith by my Works thou believest that there is one God thou doest well the Devils also believe and tremble that's the big thing oh well you just got to believe Bible says you just got to believe you do yeah but there has to be a change that's right amen that's the big gospel denominations come as you are they leave off the end part yeah change amen come as you are until it's expected of you to know better praise the Lord but wilt thou know oh vain man that faith without works is dead was not Abraham Our Father justified by works when he had offered Isaac his son upon the altar seest thou how Faith wrought with his works and by works was Faith made perfect and the scripture was fulfilled which sayith Abraham believed God and it was imputed unto him for righteousness and he was called the friend of God ye see then how that by works a man is Justified and not by faith only likewise also was not Rahab the Harlot justified by works when she had received the messengers and had sent them out another way for as the body without the spirit is dead so faith without works is dead also Rahab acted upon the message she received she got a message from those spies that her walls of Doubt her walls of bondage to sin were about to come down and she said good Master what must I do to inherit eternal life they said cast the red Scarlet robe out the window and your whoever is in this house will be spared God has come to bring down the walls of bondage to separate you from your sin and whatever is in the house covered by the blood of Christ will be spared amen for the glory of God she accepted in faith the word that they gave her and acted upon it she could have heard the word many people have heard the word but not everyone has casted the red Scarlet excuse me the Scarlet rope out the window guess what whoever walked by saw that rope hanging there amen everybody knew Rahab lived there right oh what's she doing now she now is she advertising she had to stand up and say you know what this is really weird a rope out the window but they told me to do it amen and I have faith so I'm going to amen act upon it amen around anywhere the message anything people say oh I received the word I heard it it was fantastic but there's no Scarlet thread rope hanging from their window you say you say you have faith but I see no outward appearance of that faith that you have all I see is walls of the enemy cuz guess what the devil tears down your walls then he comes in and builds his own that's right but you can't have two cities in the same spot that's right one has to be moved aside for the other to be built amen but God has given you the ability God has come with a message message amen God has come with w w with with a message to you saying arise and shine for thy light has come light pierced the darkness in rahab's life light pierced into the darkness of her family and with the destruction of Jericho brought her her freedom but the story doesn't end there as we well know she went on to be in the lineage of Christ guess what God came along broke down your wall set you free gave you a place in the city of God surrounded by the walls of faith and Revelation and then he placed you into the kingdom of God it doesn't matter where you lived before it doesn't matter the walls that you had built in your life before God has come and restored you to your promise because rad was always in the mind of God she had a memorial there was a Memorial of Rahab in Jerusalem and it was time for her to go back to her place that she was called to be you say she was a gentile doesn't matter what you are or what the world calls you or what the world has labeled you you are called there is a memorial of you in the new City Jerusalem that has your name on it there's a seat there's a house there's a street with your name on it amen and God has given you the strength and he has called you bethl the house of God Amen where God dwells there is freedom because God and because Christ is truth and where the truth is there is freedom amen you are built building walls around you but those walls bring you freedom to worship god oh oh the world says be open to everything be open to you need to be don't be so closed-minded don't be so don't you know be inclusive include everybody except for the truth except for the truth because guess what cockroaches hate light they want to hide in the darkness that's right there is nothing new Under the Sun don't ever think what you're going through has never been gone through by anybody else that was some Backwoods English there you are not experiencing anything someone hasn't experienced as well that's right lean on the brothers lean on the sisters as a bride of Christ come together amen Reach Out say you don't have to tell them just say look I need some prayer today I need some fellowship can I talk to you on the phone and just talk about God Amen you know it's good to address problems but don't stop there go on and talk about Christ because when you do he comes near and when he comes near what happens miracles happen amen praise the Lord so you see you say you have faith what do your walls look like that's it you say you've accepted the word for your hour what do your walls look like are there are they leaning in spots because you don't have time to make it right my uh my grandpa was a a a blocky when he was a young man and uh he was on this one job him and him and this guy he worked with all the time they thought on the same wavelength he said they could lay a thousand block a day and they were laying this wall and they were up I think three tiers of scaffolding and they had moved so fast the whole wall was still green and if you push it it would go like this well the scaffolding fell down for whatever reason they had to jump on the wall and they're up there you know wobbling all over the place now it was it if you don't take the time to make sure your mortar sets you get to billing into the skies and guess what it comes tumbling down you have to take the time with Christ take the time to make sure it's done right take the time to make sure you're fortified it's like the the the seed that fell and sprung up really quickly but then but then uh the attack came and it and it crumpled underneath the pressure that wall that they were building up they built it too fast and it wasn't had no strength behind it so you say oh well I have bricks and I have mortar and I I have all this stuff up there but it's all willy-nilly and it's all wobbly it looks like the message but there's no strength in it that's it it sounds like the message it sounds like the word of God I should say but there's no strength in it amen they they they talk it they say what that comes out of their mouth oh it sounds and lines up with everything but as we have seen in recent times they can preach it yeah for years and never have a revelation of it that's exactly right they had walls with no strength to them are the gates open because you are too busy at work you rushed off left the gates wide open amen praise the Lord so in the Garden of Eden the serpent or excuse me the devil slipped in to Mankind through the serpent put injected his seed into Eve through the serpent he broke down the walls of mankind but there came a Nehemiah a message from an angel Mary you shall conceive of the Holy Ghost God said you know what it's been Time Time After Time Gone by that my children don't have what they need to stand against the Ws of the devil Satan you thought you had the victory but I'm sending Nehemiah so God came down took went to Calvary for your sins and sent the Holy Ghost to give you the ability so never again will the walls of Jerusalem in your life lay waste because God has given you Nehemiah amen with the word that says arise and build amen that's right then the physical Jerusalem in in uh 96 or 830 I saw two different or I I thought it was 8030 then I saw 896 so you forgive me was it was once again taken down you see Jerusalem laid waste the city right but that's not where God was anymore God was now in his people but then you see the bride the seed of God goes into the Dark Ages the walls so to speak right the seed goes down into the ground martyr after martyr but then Nehemiah came back amen all the things that were lost in those Dark Ages all the parts of the walls that were broken down a as the word of God in those Dark Ages God sent Nehemiah and he took all those loose ends all those things that were were messed up the gates the broken Gates the Broken Walls he brought it all together and he built it back up again and once again the walls of Jerusalem are built up again now I'm taking this into a different type here now you can find refuge in that City that's it there you are you can find refuge in that City that God has come and built it back up again the world is in chaos out there right but you have Refuge amen amen the invitation is open for anyone to find refuge in the city it's funny how we as humans we as people we fight against the very thing that can give us Refuge that can give us peace we push so hard to get out of the gate and into the wild because we know what best the bills are due I can't come to church the bills are due I can't pay my tith the bills are due whatever blank insert your excuse there but God has provided a City of Refuge for you he has provided you peace he says Shalom amen Shalom I give you peace outside is all fear do you want to go outside the walls into this chaos no sir you say no I hope you're not right but I would rather sleep at night than be a billionaire yes sir I would rather have my wife and my kids than be Bill Gates amen sir that's right Steve Jobs right he had it all the money the brains the best product as far as technology was concerned yet when he died he said what was it it was pointless he says if I could give it all up to be to not be here dying with cancer I would come down to the end of the road what matters the most the the Lord provided a City of Refuge for the children of Israel and I'm coming to a close here I so sorry I didn't realize I had so much maybe we'll have a part two praise the Lord actually Sister Amy will you come Sean I'm I feel GL to just stop it right there the Lord is asking tonight what house will you build me that's right what does your house look like your walls is it strong and fortified or is it crumbling in parts so is not a a words to scare you I don't I don't I'm not getting that we have to do it daily exactly right we have to mix up the mortar I I uh we laid block with my grandpa and I I was the young guy so I did all the mortar mixing my goodness that mortar better be right if it's too soupy the bre the blocks won't set if it's too hard you can't work it you can't get it on the blocks the right way so it had to be perfect had to stick but not droop so it takes work you have a part to play and then guess what you set a block I've seen my grandpa set a block tap it into place level level level nope pull it off scrape the mortar off do it again knock it said it my dad wasn't experien so my dad pulled him off all the time but at the end of the day say my say say my grandpa set it in a couple in one try set three dad took several tries at the end of the day both blocks for sure some people takes them a little bit more time to set a block but that's why God looks at the desires of our heart he sees the work he sees the effort he sees the desire you're sitting there and you say I don't understand I have so many questions just keep laying the that's it just keep building your wall how do you build your wall feed on the word of God see everything goes back to that did you know that a no matter how great the sermon or how deep into the word of God you get it all goes back to that you have to read it you have to pray you have to feed on it you want to build your walls even if you don't understand it just read the Bible amen that's right even if you don't understand that just listen to the message even if you have nothing to say pray that's there's been many times where I've sat there and I I felt bad because I had nothing to say but just sitting there with my eyes closed thinking and feeling the presence of God I was communing with my Lord amen sometimes me and my wife in the evening we just sit there we don't got nothing to say we just sit there in each other's presence amen sometimes times that's all you have to do as a young man I struggled with things I had hardships I had friends who did things to me I had difficulties what is this what is the preacher saying I don't understand Lord give me Revelation give me Revelation give me Revelation so I would go out the back and I would sit there by myself and just just pray in My Heart Lord reveal yourself to me Time After Time After Time Again going to church feeding the best I could still making the same mistakes God is faithful and if you can do it for me he can do it for you cuz one day my eyes open wide and I tell you I cannot ever unsee what I saw and I went back and I went back to the scriptures and all the stories I read I felt like there was something missing it was there amen doesn't matter what you read you find Christ amen you find Christ but what did I have to do I had to persevere did I feel like a failure you bet did I did I feel like like why I remember laying in my bed one night and I knew of this girl around the corner I thought you know I to just slip out the window and go off just go off do my own thing I I wanted to I couldn't that's it I couldn't move I I it wasn't because my parents would be disappointed it wasn't because I would offend people it's because I just couldn't do it there were time I think about times after times after time when I was a teenager and and the things I think back now and I realize I was this close without even knowing it very naive that's the Paradox of being a teenager you think you know it all and then yeah actually don't but that's okay you'll come to that realization this close I not even knowing the Trap was there The Edge was right there standing foot poised to step and something just turns me around that's right I didn't even know it was there cuz I couldn't see it but he knew he knew amen and by the gra of God I stand here today in his serviceall not because of I I did something but because God said you're mine you are mine though my sins were as Scarlet amen his blood made me white as snow amen make sure your walls are firmly set amen amen fathers mothers your children make sure your walls are firmly set because you are their protection until they move on Amen praise the Lord hallelujah amen let's pray oh Heavenly Father we thank you Lord for your mercy in our lives Lord Jesus [Music] Lord the world doesn't have so to say their Sports their entertainment it's all been Stripped Away for the most part their normal life has been Stripped Away oh they were sending emojis to dump 2020 in the dumpster burn it with fire cuz it's a new year and what do we have to open the year with but pure chaos yet father in the midst of all this we stand here tonight with Joy on our faces we are coming every day to something even more greater than we thought possible because father we are drawing nearer and nearer to you Hallelujah Lord if there be here tonight father I say this instead those without peace may you help them may you pull them may you guide them may you give us the words to say the wisdom to guide them to be a part to play a part in their seeking of Refuge they desire in their heart there's a hunger and a thirst father but sometimes they don't realize what it is that they exactly what they need and that is you father they're fighting against that but Lord you have brought them peace and comfort within the walls not of religion cu the walls of religion keep you out but within the walls of Revelation and Faith of who Jesus Christ is father we're not Lord our desire father is to just put aside our our desires our fleshly desires and father to build up the wall when we're tired when we don't feel like it which happens all the time because of the world we live in may we push aside that and may we arise and build father we thank you Lord for all that you've done for us oh God it's good to be a Christian not a message believer a Christian father a follower of Christ amen father back in the day when Luther was here they were Christians now you have Lutheran but they're not following Christ Lord in this day and age that we live in Father we are Christians we are followers of Christ father May our eyes ever be on you never get off of you onto a man or onto some other idea from men but God to keep our eyes fixed upon you Lord give us greater revelation of your word show us what we're missing father in our lives show us what we're missing in our spiritual walk with you father all the choices and everything we are faced with Father give us leadership and guidance we ask we thank you Lord and commit these
