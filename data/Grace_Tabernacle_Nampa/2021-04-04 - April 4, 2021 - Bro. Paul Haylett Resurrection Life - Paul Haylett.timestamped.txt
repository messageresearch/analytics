[47:52] if you would say so because he already
[47:54] bought into me
[47:56] he loved me when i was unlovable he
[47:58] loved me when i i didn't know that i
[48:00] needed loved and
[48:01] my heart is just rejoicing john the 11th
[48:04] chapter we want to talk about
[48:06] resurrection life today
[48:08] i kind of spill the beans i guess it's
[48:10] easy to do
[48:11] we realize my brother and sister it's
[48:13] just fine to talk about our lord jesus
[48:15] christ dying
[48:16] on a cross at calvary gog off the hill
[48:19] but uh we want that resurrection life
[48:22] to be in us hallelujah and you know it's
[48:26] time
[48:27] i think i keep i keep you know going
[48:29] back and forth to this it's time for us
[48:31] saints to get a little more confidence
[48:33] to stand up and
[48:35] literally make the declaration and never
[48:37] back away from it again
[48:39] that the reason that there was
[48:42] a calvary is you and i
[48:49] he didn't do that just to say i died
[48:52] he did that because he was making a
[48:55] claim
[48:56] to the world to the devil of who it was
[49:00] the world today will fill up the
[49:01] church's record numbers
[49:03] john 11 starting with the 20th verse
[49:07] amen then martha as soon as she heard
[49:12] that jesus was coming
[49:14] went and met him but mary sat still
[49:17] in the house then said martha unto jesus
[49:21] lord if thou hast been here
[49:24] my brother had not died pretty strong
[49:27] words isn't it
[49:28] she's telling him this is how it would
[49:30] be if you
[49:32] had been here he wouldn't have died see
[49:34] she failed to recognize the true plan of
[49:37] god
[49:38] the resurrection had to be manifested
[49:42] as a testimony a pre-figure
[49:46] to the resurrection and my brother and
[49:49] sister
[49:51] there's some around the message that
[49:52] would disagree with me but you see the
[49:54] rapture is not an event in the future
[49:56] the rapture is taking place
[49:58] right now because there's got to be a
[50:00] rapturing of the hearts and minds as it
[50:02] were
[50:03] of the bride of christ before the
[50:05] rapture comes
[50:07] there is a catching away there is a
[50:09] claiming there is a changing taking
[50:12] place amongst the people and so we look
[50:15] as brother chris i got nervous about him
[50:16] this morning
[50:17] you know we're looking to that day we're
[50:19] looking to events we're looking to
[50:21] things to happen
[50:22] but my brother and sister the most
[50:23] important thing is to look to where we
[50:25] are today
[50:26] and to make sure that the resurrection
[50:28] life is kindled
[50:30] in us today the fire is burning
[50:33] amen it's not enough to talk about it
[50:35] it's not enough to confess it's going to
[50:37] take place
[50:38] not to say we're looking for a day
[50:40] somewhere in the future the rapture my
[50:42] brother and sister
[50:43] is being manifested this morning right
[50:45] here the resurrection is being
[50:47] manifested here
[50:49] this morning
[50:55] but i know that even now whatsoever thou
[50:58] will ask of god
[50:59] god will give it thee now she had
[51:01] revelation on that didn't she
[51:03] jesus saith unto her thy brother shall
[51:05] rise again and
[51:06] martha saith unto him i know that he
[51:09] shall rise again
[51:10] in the resurrection at the last day
[51:13] jesus said unto her i am the
[51:16] resurrection
[51:18] and the life he that believeth in me
[51:22] though he were dead yet shall he live
[51:25] now i want you to look at this my
[51:26] brother sister the way that is
[51:28] written in verse 25 though he were dead
[51:33] you see that doesn't necessarily mean
[51:35] everyone must be
[51:37] beyond the mortal life though he were
[51:41] dead
[51:42] it's placing them in a category
[51:45] because we know that death to the
[51:47] believer is only a separation from the
[51:50] carnal natural life
[51:52] into the presence of god and we know
[51:54] that death as it were
[51:55] is only a separation and when one is
[51:58] dead
[51:59] in christ if he is in the lord he is
[52:02] then dead to himself
[52:04] if he is in the flesh he has been
[52:07] separated from god
[52:10] you see how's this paradox that's in
[52:12] there but he's telling him even though
[52:14] he were dead
[52:16] yet shall he live and whoso liveth and
[52:19] believeth in me
[52:21] shall never die believeth thou
[52:24] this and i say lord i believe
[52:27] heavenly father we ask for your hand of
[52:29] mercy today speak to us i pray father
[52:32] guide our words your name amen
[52:35] you may be seated saints
[52:50] as i look at my notes here i have in
[52:52] bold letters here
[52:54] we celebrate jesus rising from the dead
[53:02] i want to know if you're celebrating
[53:04] your
[53:05] rising from the dead
[53:10] you see there comes a time it's not
[53:12] boastful it's not of our own merit our
[53:14] own values but there comes a time that
[53:16] we must recognize
[53:17] lift our hands and our hearts to say
[53:19] thank you lord i've been raised from the
[53:21] dead
[53:22] amen nothing can go back and change as
[53:25] it were our lord jesus christ
[53:27] amen we think about this uh remember the
[53:30] near kinsman redeemer
[53:32] and how when that come to pass that the
[53:34] near kinsman redeemer
[53:36] is standing there and he has his
[53:38] opportunity to redeem
[53:40] but he says i'm not going to redeem
[53:43] because
[53:44] it might mar my own inheritance
[53:47] now we understand my brother and sister
[53:49] in this scripture
[53:50] how we can type this over to how us
[53:53] being born
[53:54] and shaped born in sin shaped in
[53:55] iniquity that we have a near kinsman
[53:58] redeemer
[53:59] but i'm telling you today he would not
[54:01] mar his testimony
[54:03] because he was afraid that if he laid
[54:05] his life down
[54:06] paid the price for you that he could not
[54:09] raise it up again
[54:10] so he says i will not die for them i
[54:13] will try to take what god has already
[54:15] given
[54:16] and i will try to pervert that i will
[54:18] try to make a claim
[54:19] as it is my own but my brother and
[54:21] sister the word of god says
[54:23] i will never lose a one amen each one i
[54:26] have called will come
[54:28] hallelujah aren't you glad this morning
[54:30] that we'll look at this and remember
[54:31] this near kinsman redeemer
[54:33] satan not willing to risk his life for
[54:36] your life then why would we give our
[54:37] life for him
[54:39] amen that's the paradox of the world
[54:41] that we live in today
[54:43] is that one who is not willing to risk
[54:45] his life for them but they'll risk and
[54:47] give their life
[54:48] for him and so we look at this my
[54:50] brother and sister in such a
[54:52] fashion to realize as it is that we
[54:54] celebrate
[54:55] jesus rising from the dead and there
[54:58] comes a season according to the word of
[55:00] god that we as sons and daughters will
[55:01] rise up
[55:02] and we will give praise and glory and
[55:04] honor to the king
[55:06] for we now can stand and celebrate
[55:09] rising from the dead
[55:10] and so though we were as dead we are now
[55:13] living
[55:14] and so we recognize the resurrection
[55:16] life the resurrection power
[55:18] that has been given to us amen so you
[55:22] know
[55:22] my brother and sister we celebrate the
[55:24] death unto life in us
[55:26] and we recognize that we as sons and
[55:28] daughters of god
[55:29] must die it is a paradox as we look at
[55:32] this to realize that
[55:33] the more that we die the more we live
[55:36] amen and satan has perverted that and
[55:39] says you know what them poor christians
[55:41] they just got they're just so bound down
[55:43] they don't get to do nothing
[55:44] well my brother and sister we get to do
[55:47] something we get to worship the king and
[55:48] he blesses us
[55:50] and life is good and everything is good
[55:52] wait oh oh
[55:53] you don't get to know my brother and
[55:55] sister there's no desire in us to do
[55:57] that
[55:57] there's no looking at that saying look
[55:59] what i'm giving up
[56:01] if we're still in a position today where
[56:03] we're looking at something and saying oh
[56:05] to serve god i have to give this up then
[56:08] you need to get down to an altar
[56:10] somewhere because
[56:11] the real heart of a son or daughter of
[56:13] god that's had a life-changing event
[56:16] is not looking at the things of the
[56:17] world saying i wished i could be that
[56:19] but i have to be this
[56:20] no it's a change a nature change
[56:24] amen it's not just a going to church
[56:27] it's not just acknowledging
[56:28] that christ died on calvary millions of
[56:31] people will acknowledge that today
[56:33] without a nature change
[56:36] come on my brother and sister it takes a
[56:39] temper away from us
[56:40] it takes the pride of life and the lust
[56:42] of the flesh it takes all of these
[56:44] things
[56:44] that's what a nature change is it's not
[56:47] a mental conception
[56:48] that god did this so we're okay my
[56:50] brother and sister
[56:51] a nature change now look the devil will
[56:54] come in there and he throws all kinds of
[56:56] traps and stumbling stones
[56:58] and you know railroad tracks as it were
[57:00] and and all kinds of stuff to get that
[57:02] but don't forget my brother and sister
[57:04] there is resurrection life
[57:06] in you and every day that we live we're
[57:09] coming closer
[57:10] to the resurrection amen to that great
[57:13] manifestation that it would be
[57:15] and if there is no resurrection life in
[57:18] us
[57:18] then all of this is in vain
[57:23] we're wasting our time
[57:26] i think sometimes it's just good to get
[57:28] right down where the rubber meets the
[57:29] road right
[57:30] amen the rubber meets the road says if
[57:33] this is not
[57:34] changing us if this is not giving us a
[57:38] hope or a vision
[57:40] then we're wasting our time but still i
[57:43] wished i had that i'd
[57:45] i think i might just get it into the
[57:46] memory in the computer back there so we
[57:48] can post it
[57:49] you know just a lovely writing that
[57:50] somebody said you know if
[57:52] if you're in sin still come to church if
[57:54] you're this and that goes through the
[57:56] whole gamut of human
[57:57] frailty and and weakness and and
[58:00] whatever
[58:00] if you're doing it still come to church
[58:02] if you're doing it still come to church
[58:04] because it's by the washing of the water
[58:06] of the word amen but you
[58:08] need to come to a place that you can
[58:10] recognize god is doing something in me
[58:13] amen don't just sit back and say well if
[58:15] god wants to be a christian
[58:17] then god will make me a christian no my
[58:19] brother and sister there's something in
[58:20] you and i
[58:21] something that's alive something that's
[58:23] growing each and every day
[58:24] that's pulling us into the presence of
[58:26] almighty god
[58:28] hallelujah amen now i want to just read
[58:31] hebrews 9 11 through 17
[58:34] but christ become a high priest of good
[58:38] things to come
[58:41] by a greater and more perfect tabernacle
[58:43] not made with hands that is to say
[58:46] not of this building neither by the
[58:48] blood of goats and calves but by his
[58:51] own blood in that beautiful
[58:55] his own blood he then replaced as it
[58:58] were
[58:59] the blood of the goat and the calf
[59:00] because you see my brother and sister
[59:02] the blood of the goat and calf covered
[59:04] sins in the past it didn't change the
[59:06] nature of the man
[59:08] but god said i've got a better covenant
[59:10] that's going to change the nature of the
[59:12] man
[59:12] that we no longer even have need to
[59:14] offer the goat and the calf or the
[59:16] turtle dove
[59:17] because the nature of the man himself
[59:19] will be changed
[59:21] oh how glorious how beautiful
[59:28] neither by the blood of goats and calves
[59:30] but by his own blood he
[59:32] entered into one holy place having
[59:34] obtained
[59:35] eternal redemption
[59:38] no expiration date no cancellation date
[59:42] look we live in a council society
[59:44] they're trying to cancel everything
[59:46] but there's something they cannot cancel
[59:49] and that is the redemption of the blood
[59:51] of jesus christ
[59:52] no matter how they speak ill of it no
[59:54] matter how
[59:55] little respect they have of it they
[59:58] can't cancel it because it's an eternal
[1:00:00] redemption
[1:00:01] and aren't you glad this morning we
[1:00:03] possess that eternal redemption
[1:00:05] they can cancel it and turn it all into
[1:00:07] a form of godliness they can turn it all
[1:00:10] into some kind of uh idolatry my
[1:00:13] brothers and sisters what it comes down
[1:00:14] to
[1:00:15] it comes down to an idolatry that that
[1:00:17] we go to church and we say these words
[1:00:20] and we do this
[1:00:21] and all as well but there's no life
[1:00:23] there because they're still
[1:00:24] trying to cancel it by the blood of
[1:00:27] bulls and goats
[1:00:28] they never accepted the plan of god
[1:00:31] which brought us into a plan
[1:00:33] of eternal redemption they say we
[1:00:35] believe that we believe that but they're
[1:00:37] not acting upon it
[1:00:39] amen for if the blood of bulls and goats
[1:00:41] and the ashes of a heifer sprinkle the
[1:00:43] unclean
[1:00:44] sanctifieth to the purifying of the
[1:00:46] flesh how much more
[1:00:49] can i say that again how much more shall
[1:00:52] the blood of
[1:00:53] christ who through the eternal spirit
[1:00:58] offered mankind no let's get this down
[1:01:00] into a level
[1:01:01] offered me offered you he come
[1:01:04] and made the offer to you not something
[1:01:07] just
[1:01:08] in general not something vague but to
[1:01:11] us he made this offer
[1:01:14] and it will be to us to accept or
[1:01:16] decline
[1:01:18] oh hallelujah you know i love free moral
[1:01:21] agency my brother and sister and if god
[1:01:23] had
[1:01:24] not left this door open there would be
[1:01:26] no free moral agency
[1:01:28] but i'm telling you i thank god because
[1:01:30] my spirit is weak
[1:01:31] your spirit is weak sometimes we get
[1:01:33] under a burden we get under anointing
[1:01:35] and we just almost get this attitude
[1:01:37] does it even matter
[1:01:39] but the holy spirit comes along and
[1:01:41] nudges you
[1:01:42] and keeps nudging you until you're there
[1:01:45] and something sparks inside of you
[1:01:47] and you say i can't quit i can't walk
[1:01:51] away i
[1:01:52] can't deny this
[1:01:55] oh we'll be a peter no no no
[1:01:59] i wasn't what the words were peter
[1:02:01] actually spoke
[1:02:02] we might be shocked that peter the
[1:02:04] apostle might have used some words that
[1:02:06] we would have blotted out or blurred or
[1:02:08] went
[1:02:09] burp over in his denying
[1:02:13] no i'm not br b of that
[1:02:18] crocodile
[1:02:22] oh peter left us because he wasn't one
[1:02:25] of us
[1:02:27] no peter went out and wept bitterly
[1:02:31] because while he didn't have the courage
[1:02:33] to stand
[1:02:35] he was anointed to fulfill the word
[1:02:40] pretty short prophecy saints when you
[1:02:42] think about it jesus told him
[1:02:44] you'll deny me thrice before the
[1:02:47] crows
[1:02:49] it wasn't weeks months and years
[1:02:56] such a short time peter said i wouldn't
[1:03:00] deny you lord i couldn't deny you
[1:03:04] but when my flesh is weak and my spirit
[1:03:06] is dampened and the devil says you know
[1:03:07] what
[1:03:08] you're just not good enough you're just
[1:03:09] not good enough have you ever noticed
[1:03:11] how god
[1:03:12] might let you go for a few days might
[1:03:14] let you wallow in the sauce of your own
[1:03:16] pity
[1:03:20] but then he comes along and the word
[1:03:22] comes to you
[1:03:23] and starts saying that's not who you are
[1:03:26] why was you listening to him why was you
[1:03:28] thinking his thoughts
[1:03:29] why was you receiving that anointing
[1:03:31] that's not who you are
[1:03:33] and something inside of you gets you out
[1:03:36] of your pity and you start to say that's
[1:03:38] right that's right
[1:03:39] that's not who i am i never believed
[1:03:41] that's who i was
[1:03:42] why did i listen come on am i alone
[1:03:46] hallelujah this is god's great plan my
[1:03:49] brother and sister moving us
[1:03:50] along and satan has to get creative but
[1:03:53] i'll tell you he's so creative
[1:03:55] that he's managed to take the word loser
[1:03:58] which is tattooed you might say upon his
[1:04:00] forehead
[1:04:00] and tried to convince the world that
[1:04:03] he's the winner
[1:04:05] but that doesn't change the fact he's a
[1:04:07] loser and he knows he's a loser
[1:04:09] so he's going to take whoever he can
[1:04:11] with him
[1:04:13] on his losing journey i don't sign up
[1:04:17] for that
[1:04:18] i refuse to be identified with that
[1:04:23] amen hallelujah
[1:04:29] how much more oh look at that my brother
[1:04:33] and sister
[1:04:34] under this verse 13 the old testament
[1:04:37] under that anointing
[1:04:38] there was many a man woman and child
[1:04:41] lived exactly to the best of their
[1:04:44] ability according to god's word for the
[1:04:46] day
[1:04:47] this is not something i've heard him
[1:04:49] preach that the old testament was
[1:04:51] actually almost like a failure of the
[1:04:53] plan of god
[1:04:54] nonsense there were people that lived
[1:04:57] overcoming lives
[1:04:58] in the old testament there were people
[1:05:00] that lived according to the word
[1:05:02] in the old testament but we have mowed
[1:05:05] so much
[1:05:06] more hallelujah how much more shall the
[1:05:10] blood of christ
[1:05:11] look at this raising us up enoch was an
[1:05:14] overcomer
[1:05:15] please god and did not see death amen
[1:05:18] under the old covenant but we under the
[1:05:21] new
[1:05:22] covenant have so much more oh
[1:05:25] hallelujah hallelujah
[1:05:28] how much more shall the blood of christ
[1:05:31] who through the eternal spirit
[1:05:33] holy ghost offered himself
[1:05:36] without spot
[1:05:40] now this might sound arrogant to a
[1:05:42] person who doesn't have revelation
[1:05:46] but if jesus christ can do it could do
[1:05:50] it
[1:05:51] i can do it whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa
[1:05:55] paul you just stepped over the line
[1:05:58] no sir i'm ahead of myself a little bit
[1:06:00] but i'll just go ahead and say it
[1:06:02] all that was in christ
[1:06:05] he poured into who
[1:06:09] who's the church right here this morning
[1:06:14] so all that was in christ he poured into
[1:06:16] you and i
[1:06:18] and he overcome every sin and every
[1:06:20] transgression
[1:06:21] and every struggle there was so i can
[1:06:25] also all i've got to do
[1:06:28] is let the life of christ completely
[1:06:30] fill me
[1:06:32] hallelujah amen
[1:06:36] oh is it all right if we get excited
[1:06:38] this morning
[1:06:39] i'll tell you i went to bed last night
[1:06:41] like okay lord i've got this i got this
[1:06:43] i don't know what to say lord how do i
[1:06:44] put this together
[1:06:46] but i'll tell you god is faithful he'll
[1:06:47] come right down he'll let words be
[1:06:49] spoken he'll let you listen to something
[1:06:51] and my brother and sister god will just
[1:06:53] give an inspiration to you to take a
[1:06:55] hold
[1:06:56] and say this is mine hallelujah
[1:07:00] purge your conscience from dead works to
[1:07:03] serve the living god
[1:07:05] oh now look what dead works are say yeah
[1:07:08] about when i was back in denomination
[1:07:09] i'm talking about yesterday
[1:07:13] let what hindered you yesterday die
[1:07:17] stand up and take a hold of the word and
[1:07:19] say i might have failed i might have got
[1:07:21] angry at my wife
[1:07:22] my children i gotta go upset about this
[1:07:24] that and the other yesterday
[1:07:26] but today i'm gonna let that die a
[1:07:28] little bit more
[1:07:29] and take a hold of a little bit more
[1:07:31] christ
[1:07:32] and then overcoming power one day you'll
[1:07:35] wake up and realize that man they used
[1:07:37] to identify as having a temper
[1:07:39] no longer has a temper and somebody say
[1:07:41] well maybe he's just old and tired no
[1:07:43] maybe he's delivered
[1:07:46] because i met some 90 year olds that got
[1:07:48] a temper enough to fight a buzz saw
[1:07:52] unfortunately i was the direction of
[1:07:53] their buzz saw hallelujah
[1:07:57] now look at this
[1:08:00] for this cause he is a mediator of a new
[1:08:04] testament
[1:08:04] and that by means of death for the
[1:08:07] redemption of the transgressions that
[1:08:09] were under the
[1:08:10] first testament they which are called
[1:08:12] might receive the promise
[1:08:14] of eternal inheritance
[1:08:18] isn't that beautiful my brother and
[1:08:19] sister but you understand i'm just going
[1:08:21] to take a a loose liberal
[1:08:24] interpretation of some of the things the
[1:08:25] prophet of god said he said that you
[1:08:27] have to die you want more of god you've
[1:08:29] got to give more of yourself
[1:08:31] you want more of god in your life you
[1:08:33] have to die more and more and more
[1:08:35] so this experience we call a christian
[1:08:38] experience
[1:08:39] isn't just jesus dying on the cross it's
[1:08:42] you and i
[1:08:42] dying on our cross hallelujah and we
[1:08:46] have such a desire
[1:08:47] to live that that's one of our biggest
[1:08:49] problems isn't it
[1:08:51] it's our desire to live and then under
[1:08:53] that nature we want to live the way we
[1:08:55] want to live
[1:08:57] but god says i want you to die and i
[1:08:58] want you to live my way to live
[1:09:01] die to you live to me hallelujah
[1:09:05] well you know that's exactly what he did
[1:09:06] for you and i
[1:09:08] he died to himself right
[1:09:11] oh if we were there my brother and
[1:09:13] sister and witness calvary
[1:09:15] when he said lord not my will
[1:09:18] but thine be done we would
[1:09:21] realize that was not just some random
[1:09:23] words that was an
[1:09:25] agonizing giving into the will of god
[1:09:28] i pray my brother and sister and i'll
[1:09:30] put my name on the top of the list
[1:09:32] not to take priority but to let you know
[1:09:35] i belong on that list
[1:09:37] that we need to be praying that prayer a
[1:09:39] little more often
[1:09:40] lord not my will lord but thy
[1:09:44] will be done and it would change the
[1:09:47] directions i'll tell you
[1:09:48] sometimes it changed our decisions
[1:10:00] hallelujah
[1:10:02] for where a testament is there must also
[1:10:06] be
[1:10:06] necessity be the death of the testador
[1:10:10] that's right for a testament is of force
[1:10:14] after men are dead otherwise
[1:10:17] it is of no strength at all while the
[1:10:19] testator
[1:10:20] living did you just hear what i read
[1:10:25] oh praise the lord this come into effect
[1:10:27] after jesus was dead no this scripture's
[1:10:29] talking about you
[1:10:34] i'm a believer i'm a believer
[1:10:37] if you still live your own life come on
[1:10:41] we not know our preaching condemnation
[1:10:43] this morning but while
[1:10:45] you still live your life will testify
[1:10:48] against your confession that i'm a
[1:10:50] christian
[1:10:52] am i too close to home should i come a
[1:10:54] little closer to home
[1:10:56] hallelujah while we are still in the
[1:10:59] flesh we're still in our own mind in our
[1:11:01] own spirit
[1:11:02] our own words our own actions our own
[1:11:04] life will testify
[1:11:06] directly against you being a christian
[1:11:11] but i'll tell you what the minute you
[1:11:13] start dying
[1:11:14] the minute you start giving yourself
[1:11:16] over your life your testimony
[1:11:19] starts to blossom and people start to
[1:11:21] say i see
[1:11:22] something in him he's different she's
[1:11:24] different what's happening or
[1:11:25] dying he's living but as long as we
[1:11:31] are living our testimony
[1:11:35] will be a paradox
[1:11:41] i'll be back in a few minutes i've got
[1:11:42] to go in the back room and cry
[1:11:46] because how many times
[1:11:49] does our life defy
[1:11:53] our testimony
[1:11:57] don't get condemnation die
[1:12:02] amen go to your own personal calvary as
[1:12:06] it were
[1:12:07] and just die lord thy will
[1:12:10] be done hallelujah
[1:12:13] now we look at this my brother and
[1:12:15] sister just kind of moving forward here
[1:12:17] got so
[1:12:18] much that i want to share this morning
[1:12:20] and and i i just need to move right
[1:12:22] along
[1:12:23] now in this message the sermon i know
[1:12:26] brother branham is actually speaking of
[1:12:27] job i encourage
[1:12:28] once again each one of you to um go back
[1:12:31] study these things you have the
[1:12:33] reference point you can find it on the
[1:12:34] website and and
[1:12:36] you know so you don't have to write a
[1:12:37] thousand notes right now or be afraid
[1:12:39] you'll miss something
[1:12:40] but he's really talking about job before
[1:12:43] this and
[1:12:43] after this but i want i just wanted to
[1:12:45] catch the spirit of these words right
[1:12:47] here
[1:12:48] oh blessed be the name of the lord i'm
[1:12:50] so glad that i'm a part
[1:12:52] of easter
[1:12:55] now we didn't have an easter egg hunt we
[1:12:58] haven't had bunnies we didn't have a
[1:13:00] camel in our church today
[1:13:04] we didn't make some big program about
[1:13:06] this
[1:13:08] because you see that was man's version
[1:13:11] well actually not even man's version
[1:13:12] it's the devil's version of easter
[1:13:15] he watered that thing down to where
[1:13:17] praise the lord we were so blessed we
[1:13:19] watched the same donkey for the last 24
[1:13:21] years and the camel
[1:13:23] and uh happened to know the guy who owns
[1:13:24] the camel and
[1:13:26] you know he says you know this whole
[1:13:28] easter thing is the only reason i own a
[1:13:30] camel because it just blesses everybody
[1:13:33] i have not found anywhere in scripture a
[1:13:36] camel
[1:13:37] blessing the people
[1:13:41] so you see where people are at when it
[1:13:42] comes to easter they just see the camel
[1:13:44] and they've watched this camel for 25
[1:13:47] years and
[1:13:48] this is just so oh god bless the camel
[1:13:52] come on saints i'm not trying to be
[1:13:54] funny
[1:13:59] i'm so glad that i'm apart can i
[1:14:01] interpret the word the prophet's words
[1:14:02] this morning
[1:14:04] i'm so glad i'm a part of the
[1:14:06] resurrection
[1:14:08] that's what easter is it's not bunny
[1:14:10] rabbits and it's not eggs and it's not
[1:14:12] camels and donkeys and whatever
[1:14:14] my brother and sister i'm so glad i'm a
[1:14:17] part of the resurrection
[1:14:19] you see he comes right here and says it
[1:14:21] you see i wasn't original
[1:14:24] i like to preach a defensible gospel
[1:14:27] right
[1:14:27] i'm so glad i'm a part of easter then
[1:14:29] i'm a part of that resurrection
[1:14:31] we are part of it this morning because
[1:14:34] in us not around us not in our church
[1:14:39] not in our prophet
[1:14:40] not in the preachers but in us
[1:14:44] dwells that resurrection life
[1:14:47] that is the partaker
[1:14:52] that brought easter
[1:14:57] so you see the resurrection life can be
[1:14:58] right here this morning
[1:15:00] but we have to be a partaker
[1:15:04] we have to be an active partaker
[1:15:08] of the resurrection
[1:15:11] it's not one sunday a year
[1:15:19] that brought easter i know that my
[1:15:22] redeemer these
[1:15:23] words right i know that my redeemer what
[1:15:26] do you know
[1:15:27] i'm not guessing at it you got we got
[1:15:29] too much guessing today
[1:15:31] i know my redeemer liveth
[1:15:35] yes sir i want to ask you this morning
[1:15:37] do you know
[1:15:38] hallelujah aren't you glad this morning
[1:15:40] you can say i know my redeemer liveth
[1:15:43] this is not a ceremony that we're just
[1:15:45] partaking in
[1:15:46] he's real he's alive he's here today
[1:15:49] the same god that stood right there my
[1:15:52] brother and sister with the prophet of
[1:15:53] god
[1:15:54] discern the hearts of the people change
[1:15:56] lives
[1:15:57] open the word is here this morning oh
[1:16:00] how do you know
[1:16:01] because he said he would be
[1:16:04] now i'll compliment as it were my
[1:16:06] brother and sister to you
[1:16:08] he said where two or three are gathered
[1:16:11] in my name
[1:16:12] and we're not gonna say now there's one
[1:16:15] there's one there's one
[1:16:16] i'm more confident than that there is
[1:16:19] and there
[1:16:19] is and there is and there is and there
[1:16:21] is we've got a multitude
[1:16:23] of the two or three that believe this
[1:16:25] morning and so if god promised to be
[1:16:27] here
[1:16:28] where two or three were gathered in his
[1:16:29] name what would he do
[1:16:31] with the bulk or the whole of great
[1:16:33] tabernacle this morning
[1:16:34] believing the word don't let satan limit
[1:16:38] you
[1:16:38] we have been given a multiplied power in
[1:16:40] this last hour you say what do you mean
[1:16:42] by that brother paul
[1:16:43] the prophet of god said that god would
[1:16:46] pour out everything
[1:16:47] that was in heaven into the midst of his
[1:16:50] bride
[1:16:50] and that she would receive the word and
[1:16:53] she was an overcomer
[1:16:55] hallelujah we're not here defeated i i
[1:16:58] rebuke
[1:16:59] in the name of jesus christ that
[1:17:01] defeated christian spirit
[1:17:03] i rebuke it the day for that should be
[1:17:07] over
[1:17:08] we are the bride of christ and the work
[1:17:10] has been manifested it's been open
[1:17:12] it's been revealed it's been laid out
[1:17:14] clear and revelation has come
[1:17:17] that we can look at the book and say
[1:17:18] praise god that's what he meant
[1:17:21] [Applause]
[1:17:23] we're not guessing we're not hoping
[1:17:25] we're knowing
[1:17:28] oh hallelujah i'm not guessing at it
[1:17:31] we got too much guessing today
[1:17:35] can we say that together i know my
[1:17:38] redeemer liveth
[1:17:40] hallelujah not a hope soul
[1:17:45] amen
[1:17:52] you see resurrection life those words of
[1:17:55] life
[1:17:56] already been spoken
[1:18:00] it's pretty funny i don't mean to make
[1:18:02] this a negative note okay
[1:18:04] but we got people well i'll tell you
[1:18:07] what i i just um i left the message
[1:18:09] because you know brother branham said
[1:18:11] this this and this and i'm thinking
[1:18:14] yeah brother brown did say that
[1:18:17] but so did my bible amen
[1:18:21] you see that anointing comes and they
[1:18:24] need
[1:18:24] someone i know none of you have ever
[1:18:26] done this none of you have ever stopped
[1:18:28] and looked around said who can i blame
[1:18:29] this on
[1:18:34] come on come on saints let's just stand
[1:18:38] up and say lord
[1:18:39] i'm in the house of god and the word
[1:18:40] said that i come here to judge myself
[1:18:43] i don't come here you know it's kind of
[1:18:45] like look at the floor this happened
[1:18:47] many years ago i looked at the floor one
[1:18:48] time and our
[1:18:49] family got done eating supper and i told
[1:18:51] jerry i said my goodness look at the
[1:18:53] mess these kids have made
[1:18:55] she didn't say anything and later on in
[1:18:57] the evening
[1:18:58] she goes paul i just want to correct
[1:19:00] something i was like what's that
[1:19:02] that's where you were sitting
[1:19:12] like father like son
[1:19:16] i'll tell you what my brother and sister
[1:19:18] we're looking at this word
[1:19:23] are you with me it's open
[1:19:27] if i can ever get going here i need to
[1:19:29] gain some traction
[1:19:31] hallelujah resurrection life my brother
[1:19:34] and sister the words of life have
[1:19:35] already been spoken
[1:19:37] we don't even come on are you with me we
[1:19:39] don't have to go back and say brother
[1:19:40] branham open the words of life to us
[1:19:41] no my brother and sister before the
[1:19:43] foundation of the world
[1:19:45] the words of life were spoken a prophet
[1:19:48] come and set it all in order
[1:19:50] and draw our attention correctly to the
[1:19:52] word but you see the words had already
[1:19:54] been spoken
[1:19:55] you see when god said let there be light
[1:19:57] he couldn't go for a little while and
[1:19:58] say you know i've changed my mind
[1:20:02] so when the words of life were spoken
[1:20:03] before the foundation of the world
[1:20:05] and each one of us was placed in the
[1:20:07] book and our name wrote there in his
[1:20:09] own precious blood he could come along
[1:20:11] and say you know i think i'll take their
[1:20:12] name out
[1:20:13] i don't like the sound of that name you
[1:20:15] know some of you guys name your kids
[1:20:16] some weird names
[1:20:19] it's a good deal that some of these
[1:20:20] old-fashioned people aren't the ones
[1:20:22] judging by names
[1:20:24] they'd go what that don't sound good
[1:20:26] scratch out now
[1:20:31] are you with me no he spoke your name
[1:20:35] he knew what he was speaking when he
[1:20:36] spoke your name and he spoke the words
[1:20:39] of life into your name
[1:20:42] he can't take it back he won't take it
[1:20:43] back he doesn't want to take it back
[1:20:45] he knows you he claimed you and he
[1:20:48] declared you
[1:20:50] hallelujah somebody ought to stand up
[1:20:53] shout and say
[1:20:53] thank you lord hallelujah my name's in
[1:20:56] that book and it can't be removed
[1:21:00] the devil's not going to do it the
[1:21:02] doubters of this world aren't going to
[1:21:04] do it
[1:21:05] i don't need a vaccine a passport to
[1:21:08] claim my position
[1:21:09] amen i'm not going to come one day have
[1:21:11] you been vaccinated
[1:21:12] no sir they're going to come one day my
[1:21:14] brother and sister and say we thought
[1:21:16] there was going to be a rapture
[1:21:18] but they didn't have our approval and we
[1:21:20] were this and we were that
[1:21:21] but the bride's going to be gone because
[1:21:23] she believed the word
[1:21:26] not what a government said not what the
[1:21:28] people said not what science said
[1:21:31] what the word said
[1:21:34] hallelujah and this bride's got to hold
[1:21:36] to that word she's not letting go
[1:21:39] hallelujah amen you see let there be
[1:21:43] light it cannot be taken back
[1:21:45] the spoken word i heard it did you
[1:21:48] amen i heard it i believe it but what's
[1:21:51] more is
[1:21:52] it's coming to pass can somebody say
[1:21:55] it's coming to pass
[1:21:57] amen i want to ask you this morning have
[1:21:59] any of your prayers been answered
[1:22:01] have you seen god move on the scene
[1:22:04] i'll tell you my brother and sister i've
[1:22:06] seen god move so many times
[1:22:08] and it seems almost now don't
[1:22:10] misunderstand me
[1:22:11] it almost seems silly some of the things
[1:22:15] i have
[1:22:15] spoken and god brought it to pass
[1:22:20] you might say well that that just really
[1:22:22] isn't that important in life
[1:22:24] but god knew my heart he heard
[1:22:28] my cry and it wasn't that he thought i
[1:22:31] needed this little simple thing to come
[1:22:33] to pass
[1:22:34] he was telling me i heard you
[1:22:37] i heard you have faith
[1:22:40] i heard you right come on saints
[1:22:45] come on he hears us
[1:22:52] you see the life was released i want to
[1:22:54] say this once again the life was
[1:22:55] released by the spoken word
[1:22:57] it's not a matter of what's going on in
[1:22:59] our nation it's not a matter of what's
[1:23:01] going on in the world my brother and
[1:23:02] sister none of that matters right now
[1:23:04] the spoken word has been spoken and the
[1:23:06] life has been released
[1:23:07] and the life said that he would have a
[1:23:09] bride that would have not a spot
[1:23:11] and not a wrinkle so i don't care what
[1:23:14] the denominational church
[1:23:15] i don't want to care let me be so bold
[1:23:17] to say this morning to the world
[1:23:19] i don't care what's happening in the
[1:23:20] message around us
[1:23:23] god's word will come to pass
[1:23:28] hallelujah you see that life that was
[1:23:30] released by the spoken words what's
[1:23:32] living in you
[1:23:34] it's not it's not anything else
[1:23:37] it's not a church it's not a deal you
[1:23:39] realize my brother and sister i'm going
[1:23:41] to deviate for just a minute
[1:23:42] i wasn't going to but i'm going to
[1:23:46] do you realize my brother and sister you
[1:23:49] go through the message
[1:23:50] i'm not going to name all of them i'd
[1:23:52] struggle off top of my head to name them
[1:23:53] all
[1:23:54] but the prophet of god lays out again
[1:23:56] and again and again the power of
[1:23:58] idolatry
[1:23:59] amen and the minute the church
[1:24:02] even embraces i want you to get this
[1:24:05] embraces that would mean accepting
[1:24:09] the concept of amen
[1:24:12] amen prophet of god said the minute the
[1:24:15] church embraces
[1:24:16] that the power of god is grounded
[1:24:20] it's no longer effective
[1:24:23] could i ask a request of all of you
[1:24:27] would you just take time in this next
[1:24:29] week and look through your life and
[1:24:31] make sure you don't have something
[1:24:33] that's an idolatry
[1:24:34] that's exactly right that's exactly
[1:24:37] right
[1:24:37] just look through your life and say lord
[1:24:41] if there's something let me put it this
[1:24:43] way just ask the lord if there's
[1:24:44] something in my life lord
[1:24:49] show me amen
[1:24:52] you see the scripture declares it the
[1:24:54] prophet reiterated it
[1:24:57] idolaters don't go to heaven
[1:25:00] but look how that spirit of idolatry is
[1:25:03] so strong and it's creeping in
[1:25:07] amen hallelujah
[1:25:12] you know sister jerry and i living in a
[1:25:14] house now that was
[1:25:15] occupied by an elderly lady for several
[1:25:18] years and said empty for three years and
[1:25:20] i have no idea where the fighters come
[1:25:23] from
[1:25:25] but every day we do spider patrol in our
[1:25:28] house
[1:25:29] and they just keep coming and they just
[1:25:32] keep coming
[1:25:33] this morning i got up and walked through
[1:25:36] the house and
[1:25:37] i was like well i know a spider can walk
[1:25:40] pretty fast but how did you get here
[1:25:43] in the middle of the ceiling
[1:25:46] he won't make it any further
[1:25:50] but that's what satan's doing saints we
[1:25:52] clean our house
[1:25:54] are you with me we clean our house
[1:25:57] and something appears we clean our house
[1:26:00] and something appears
[1:26:01] we clean our house and something appears
[1:26:06] keep cleaning your house don't give up
[1:26:08] don't become downtrodden disheartened
[1:26:11] i must not be a christian because all
[1:26:12] these things just keep coming
[1:26:14] no just keep cleaning the house
[1:26:18] keep dealing with it amen god does
[1:26:22] nothing in vain saints
[1:26:24] nothing at all in vain why are so people
[1:26:27] so tossed about
[1:26:29] what a beautiful picture of the believer
[1:26:31] in the presence of god
[1:26:32] all things are his then all things was
[1:26:35] given to christ
[1:26:36] all that god was he poured into christ
[1:26:39] all that christ was
[1:26:40] poured into the church that day you'll
[1:26:43] know that i'm in the father and the
[1:26:44] father and me and i
[1:26:45] in you oh what a privilege
[1:26:49] that the believer has if they only
[1:26:53] could accept it see it's not whether
[1:26:57] that promise is available to us it is
[1:27:01] it is not whether it's been manifested
[1:27:03] somewhere else
[1:27:04] it's up to you and i to accept
[1:27:07] that hallelujah and that the beauty of
[1:27:10] it
[1:27:10] the world is embracing john 3 16 and i
[1:27:13] do too
[1:27:14] but my brother and sister the rest of
[1:27:15] the bible shows us very clearly that if
[1:27:18] we want our prayers to be heard
[1:27:20] then we believe and act on the word of
[1:27:23] god
[1:27:24] you know that's a fundamental scripture
[1:27:26] oh my just slipped my mind
[1:27:28] brother david help me where's the
[1:27:29] scripture talking about that those that
[1:27:31] believe
[1:27:32] god answers their prayer
[1:27:35] first on three yeah i'm just my mind's
[1:27:39] in a muddle i've already went to the
[1:27:40] next page
[1:27:41] my brother and sister see they wonder
[1:27:43] they wonder why
[1:27:46] the prophet of god come and said what he
[1:27:48] said
[1:27:50] had to go back to that scripture but
[1:27:51] they don't want that scripture they
[1:27:52] don't believe those scriptures are
[1:27:53] anointed they believe they're added onto
[1:27:55] they've been changed they've been
[1:27:56] misinterpreted
[1:27:57] my brother and sister but you want your
[1:27:58] prayers answered then live according to
[1:28:00] the word that's right
[1:28:02] you want god to answer your prayer then
[1:28:03] clean your life up keep keep killing the
[1:28:05] spiders
[1:28:08] see that's how it works but i believe
[1:28:14] i've said this before i'll say it again
[1:28:17] i'm kind of getting to where i don't
[1:28:18] like to use the word believer because
[1:28:20] everybody uses the word believer
[1:28:22] i'm a believer if we really believe
[1:28:24] wouldn't we act upon it
[1:28:28] if somebody said you know what brother
[1:28:30] paul you're going to go home today
[1:28:31] there's going to be a package on your
[1:28:32] step
[1:28:33] and in that package is going to be this
[1:28:34] and this a lovely gift for you
[1:28:36] my brother and sister i wouldn't go
[1:28:38] ahead and go to boise and then book a
[1:28:39] vacation i'd drive to my house
[1:28:41] and i would see if that package was
[1:28:42] there because if i believed that
[1:28:44] i would want to act upon it that's right
[1:28:51] i'll leave that one alone it'd be
[1:28:52] misinterpreted for sure
[1:28:54] hallelujah
[1:28:58] it's like an old timer once said he said
[1:29:00] only a fool gallops his horse
[1:29:02] where the ground squirrel lives
[1:29:10] all that god was he poured into christ
[1:29:12] all christ was poured into
[1:29:14] poured into the church that day you'll
[1:29:16] know that i'm in the father
[1:29:17] and the father in me and i in you look
[1:29:20] the prophet of god doesn't say whoa this
[1:29:22] is gonna be hard for you to live this is
[1:29:24] going to be difficult when you have to
[1:29:25] live up to this standard of the word
[1:29:27] he says no it's a privilege that the
[1:29:31] believer
[1:29:32] has if they only accept it
[1:29:35] so he put a little caveat you might say
[1:29:37] to that we can't just say okay the
[1:29:39] prophet said it the word says that
[1:29:40] that's good
[1:29:41] we've got to accept it we've got to
[1:29:44] accept it lord take that into our heart
[1:29:46] today lord
[1:29:47] i want to receive that i want to accept
[1:29:49] it because my brother and sister the
[1:29:51] book
[1:29:51] says the word of god says that we're
[1:29:54] gonna see signs and wonders
[1:29:55] done at the hands of the apostle meaning
[1:29:58] sons and daughters of god
[1:29:59] acting on the word not a dead church not
[1:30:02] a something we're looking for days gone
[1:30:04] by but he said it would happen
[1:30:05] here accept it
[1:30:09] and we're not saying that so that we'll
[1:30:11] have all kinds of signs and
[1:30:13] shouting and running and bouncing off
[1:30:14] the walls i'm saying it because the
[1:30:16] power of god is contained in that word
[1:30:19] and when that word is opened and we
[1:30:20] receive the word we receive the power of
[1:30:23] that word
[1:30:27] hallelujah come back simple once again
[1:30:30] to say
[1:30:31] you are the church and all that was
[1:30:34] poured into christ
[1:30:35] has been poured into you i'm an
[1:30:37] overcomer
[1:30:39] amen laodicea there's no spirit of
[1:30:41] laodicea
[1:30:42] gonna stop me from making a rapture amen
[1:30:46] i
[1:30:46] am looking at the image of my lord jesus
[1:30:48] which the prophet of god said
[1:30:50] not just your in his image he said you
[1:30:53] are
[1:30:53] a part of him oh hallelujah not just an
[1:30:57] image of him my brother and sister we
[1:31:00] can project an image on the wall
[1:31:02] that don't make me part of it but when i
[1:31:04] become part
[1:31:05] of what is happening the plan of god
[1:31:08] then the power that's in that word and
[1:31:10] our lord jesus
[1:31:11] passed out of this life in the human
[1:31:13] flesh as a victorious warrior
[1:31:17] he was not there in defeat he fulfilled
[1:31:20] catch this
[1:31:21] you say but he was crucified my brother
[1:31:24] and sister
[1:31:25] he fulfilled god's calling in his
[1:31:28] life right to the very t
[1:31:31] because he was god himself and god's own
[1:31:35] plan
[1:31:35] had to be fulfilled and god oh wow we're
[1:31:38] getting off into this
[1:31:39] but god come down created this body of
[1:31:42] flesh
[1:31:43] that gives given the name of jesus and
[1:31:45] he stepped into that body
[1:31:47] and he come down here and fulfilled
[1:31:50] everything he had declared
[1:31:52] through the ages prophecies that were
[1:31:54] 800 years old
[1:31:56] and he come down and fulfilled it
[1:32:00] oh hallelujah you talk about something
[1:32:03] incredible
[1:32:04] you imagine if you were a bystander and
[1:32:06] let god let you go back through the ages
[1:32:09] and you were setting oh well saints i
[1:32:10] hope you see this you were sitting there
[1:32:13] on the day of golgotha on the day that
[1:32:16] they crucified our lord jesus
[1:32:18] but you have the revelation that god has
[1:32:20] given you in the word right now and they
[1:32:22] would all be over there crying
[1:32:24] they've crucified our lord jesus they've
[1:32:27] crucified our redeemer they've crucified
[1:32:30] our savior
[1:32:30] and you church with me over there on the
[1:32:33] side hallelujah
[1:32:35] hallelujah they crucified him
[1:32:39] they say they're crazy but you see we
[1:32:41] could see this whole plan
[1:32:44] we're going to see what's come to the
[1:32:45] fulfillment through the ages
[1:32:47] and we're going to see it coming in
[1:32:49] place coming in place
[1:32:51] but we'll get up tomorrow morning and
[1:32:53] it'll be woe is me
[1:32:55] who always me is so hard my job and this
[1:32:58] and my children and my marriage and this
[1:33:02] and that woe
[1:33:02] is me are you serious
[1:33:06] god help us god help us he said i gave
[1:33:09] you the victory
[1:33:11] it's already yours it is yours to claim
[1:33:14] it
[1:33:14] or refuse it it's up to you but here's
[1:33:17] the victory
[1:33:18] here's overcoming power
[1:33:27] yes sir back in that day they would say
[1:33:34] how can you rejoice of them
[1:33:37] crucifying savior
[1:33:41] you realize how much more revelation god
[1:33:42] has given us in this day
[1:33:44] there's people around this message say
[1:33:46] well do you think we have more
[1:33:47] revelation
[1:33:48] than the apostles had yes we do
[1:33:53] not by our knowledge of the word
[1:33:56] but by the fact we've sought and it has
[1:33:59] become
[1:33:59] reality it is no longer words on a page
[1:34:04] to us it is life
[1:34:07] does that make us more spiritual no i
[1:34:09] read the words of paul
[1:34:11] and i'm just stunned how a man who could
[1:34:14] spend that time
[1:34:15] in arabia and come back and everything
[1:34:18] he preached lined up perfectly
[1:34:21] with everyone's revelation that was
[1:34:23] called of god
[1:34:25] i'm horrible at that amen i'm just
[1:34:27] excited every once in a while you know
[1:34:29] that i preach something find out
[1:34:30] somebody else somewhere else preach the
[1:34:32] same thing
[1:34:34] i'm just like wow how did that happen
[1:34:36] i'll tell you how it happened
[1:34:39] same holy ghost amen
[1:34:43] same god that allowed chris to get up
[1:34:45] here and terrify me with his words
[1:34:47] before he prayed
[1:34:48] right god dealing not one individual we
[1:34:51] got nobody to lift up to
[1:34:52] that's idolatry this is the holy ghost
[1:34:55] dealing with us
[1:34:56] church we ought to be praying that every
[1:34:58] one of us comes on the same page
[1:35:00] nothing tickles my heart more than to
[1:35:01] have people say i was just reading that
[1:35:03] scripture
[1:35:04] i was just reading that quote come on it
[1:35:07] tickles my heart
[1:35:08] not to say look what paul's done my
[1:35:10] brother and sister if you guys seen how
[1:35:11] paul studied sometimes
[1:35:13] you guys would say man we need to elect
[1:35:14] somebody that at least has his act
[1:35:16] together
[1:35:16] but don't worry about it i didn't change
[1:35:18] just become a preacher it's the same way
[1:35:19] i did my homework when i was in school
[1:35:24] they call it add now
[1:35:27] but when i see it on the page i say add
[1:35:29] okay i'm going to add something
[1:35:31] it's not add i just got to keep adding
[1:35:35] hallelujah
[1:35:38] once again church it was poured into you
[1:35:44] in the sermon the unveiling of god
[1:35:47] brother braham says here now the greek
[1:35:51] word there for that form i've been
[1:35:53] looking at it all
[1:35:54] day yesterday trying to think out what
[1:35:57] it was
[1:36:01] mean the prophet of god didn't sit down
[1:36:03] in a chair
[1:36:05] and just no sir
[1:36:11] he says right here i've been looking at
[1:36:14] it all day yesterday
[1:36:16] trying to think out what it was and i
[1:36:18] find come
[1:36:19] with this word of in morphe it spell the
[1:36:23] n m-o-r-p-h-e
[1:36:26] looking in the greek to find out what in
[1:36:28] morphe was
[1:36:29] i may pronounce that wrong but reason i
[1:36:32] spell it
[1:36:33] when if the tape is released the people
[1:36:35] will scholars will
[1:36:37] know what what i mean by it he
[1:36:41] when the and more faith that means that
[1:36:43] he changed himself
[1:36:45] he come down he he come down now the
[1:36:48] greek word there means that
[1:36:50] something that could not be seen yet
[1:36:52] it's there
[1:36:53] then it's changed and the eye can catch
[1:36:56] it
[1:36:57] amen think about this
[1:37:02] that's why the prophet of god said this
[1:37:03] word of god can't be explained
[1:37:06] god's got to change the eye to see it
[1:37:11] because you see if we could explain it
[1:37:12] we could just go hold vast coliseums and
[1:37:14] explain it
[1:37:17] but the word says he would hide it from
[1:37:19] those less they would see it and hear it
[1:37:21] and act on it and he would have to save
[1:37:23] them
[1:37:25] seems like a paradox right okay let's
[1:37:28] look at this
[1:37:29] this is really the quote right here i
[1:37:30] got excited right here in this portion
[1:37:32] like elijah was at dothan see
[1:37:35] the servant couldn't see all those
[1:37:37] angels around there
[1:37:39] and god just changed not brought the
[1:37:41] angels down
[1:37:43] but he changed the seeing of the servant
[1:37:47] and there was the mountains full of
[1:37:49] angels and fire and horses of fire and
[1:37:50] chariots of fire
[1:37:51] all around his prophets see they he
[1:37:54] changed the seeing
[1:37:55] the thing is already there
[1:37:59] i tell you my brother and sister my
[1:38:00] heart's desire is that god would come
[1:38:03] right down in our midst today
[1:38:04] and open our eyes to see the power of
[1:38:07] almighty god
[1:38:08] and the word manifested that is already
[1:38:10] here but what has happened is
[1:38:12] we don't see it we start to question it
[1:38:14] we pull back from it we
[1:38:15] have a little doubt here a little fear
[1:38:17] there and we say well this probably
[1:38:19] isn't so i don't know
[1:38:20] my brother and sister it's not the word
[1:38:22] it's not with god it's not with the holy
[1:38:24] ghost
[1:38:24] it's your eyes
[1:38:28] lord open my eyes change me lord to see
[1:38:32] what you're doing
[1:38:33] change me to see that this room
[1:38:35] according to the word of god
[1:38:37] has angels all about hey man now you
[1:38:40] want to go the other way let me just
[1:38:41] throw this out here and a couple of joy
[1:38:42] out of you
[1:38:43] in case you're one of those people that
[1:38:44] likes to go to the theater
[1:38:47] i hope none of you would raise your hand
[1:38:48] and say i enjoy going to the theater
[1:38:51] the prophet of god said in them theaters
[1:38:53] devils are hanging
[1:38:55] all over everything
[1:39:00] if you like to go to the theater i want
[1:39:01] you to be reminded when you walk into it
[1:39:03] next time brother paul's praying that
[1:39:04] your eyes are open
[1:39:05] that's right amen and i hope it scares
[1:39:09] the bajibers out of you
[1:39:14] come on come on saints it's time for us
[1:39:17] to get the rubber on the road
[1:39:20] time for us to recognize this is not a
[1:39:22] game
[1:39:23] amen so there it is there's a prophet
[1:39:26] and he's telling them don't worry about
[1:39:28] it his servant's saying but lord look at
[1:39:30] this well we got a problem
[1:39:32] he doesn't say now lord this and that he
[1:39:34] says lord if you would just open his
[1:39:35] eyes
[1:39:37] our way of looking at it suddenly god
[1:39:39] started piling angels on the hills
[1:39:42] no sir they were there all the time
[1:39:43] [Music]
[1:39:45] hallelujah amen
[1:39:49] it changed the seeing the thing is
[1:39:51] already there and that's what revelation
[1:39:53] is in this word my brother and sister
[1:39:55] god didn't come down and have to morph
[1:39:56] his word around and change that
[1:39:58] what he does he comes along and by the
[1:40:00] grace of god by revelation
[1:40:01] we start to see amen
[1:40:05] we start to see that these things are
[1:40:06] coming to pass we start to see
[1:40:08] how what god meant when he spoke these
[1:40:10] things through a prophet
[1:40:12] hallelujah let's go ahead i i just
[1:40:15] included this and i was
[1:40:16] almost skipped it so what i'm trying to
[1:40:18] say that god
[1:40:20] that always was is here
[1:40:25] does it get any simpler than that the
[1:40:28] god that
[1:40:28] always was take this second it just
[1:40:32] ticked and go all the way through
[1:40:35] history
[1:40:37] that god is here right now
[1:40:44] i say in all sincerity lord
[1:40:48] change our seeing amen
[1:40:53] lord change us we are not woe be gone we
[1:40:57] are not forsaken we are not left
[1:41:01] never been abandoned we can stand and
[1:41:04] see the vision to know
[1:41:06] that god in his power and his majesty is
[1:41:09] right here surrounding you as sons and
[1:41:12] daughters of god
[1:41:13] but you have to accept it
[1:41:24] oh
[1:41:28] lord help us
[1:41:36] the only thing he done when he become
[1:41:38] man
[1:41:40] he changed his mask
[1:41:43] come on saints go right back through the
[1:41:45] message go back right back through this
[1:41:46] scripture
[1:41:48] that was god that was god walking
[1:41:51] on the road to emmaus that was god there
[1:41:55] when those people said did you not know
[1:41:57] what has happened
[1:41:58] what history has played out and how
[1:42:01] our redeemer our savior the messiah
[1:42:04] has been taken from us
[1:42:08] and jesus own word said
[1:42:12] i'll not leave you comfortless
[1:42:15] and he fulfilled his word right there
[1:42:17] before their eyes
[1:42:20] what did they see a changing
[1:42:23] in their seeing and they said hey
[1:42:26] and he was gone revelation they saw that
[1:42:30] christ was right there in their midst
[1:42:33] my brother and sister i pray today that
[1:42:36] we could grasp this
[1:42:38] in a fashion to realize our healing has
[1:42:40] not escaped us
[1:42:42] the holy ghost has not escaped us amen
[1:42:45] the power of god in our midst for our
[1:42:47] young people and for life and
[1:42:49] necessities of life
[1:42:50] and the cares of life god has not
[1:42:52] forsaken us but our vision
[1:42:54] our seeing has looked to our
[1:42:56] circumstance our seeing has looked to
[1:42:58] the problems of life
[1:42:59] our seeing has looked to everything but
[1:43:01] calvary and when we look away my brother
[1:43:03] and sister
[1:43:04] it's not our responsibility to make it
[1:43:06] come to pass
[1:43:07] our responsibility is to believe it and
[1:43:10] when we believe it god will bring it to
[1:43:12] pass but you walk in a half-hearted
[1:43:14] approach to the word and you'll get a
[1:43:16] half-hearted response out of god
[1:43:18] he said you draw nigh unto me i'll draw
[1:43:20] an eye unto you
[1:43:21] and if god won't fulfill that then god's
[1:43:23] a liar and we don't want to follow him
[1:43:25] but my god is not a liar
[1:43:28] he's worth following he's the word he's
[1:43:30] the way the truth and the life
[1:43:33] we're going to stop letting the devil
[1:43:35] deceive us we got to stop letting the
[1:43:37] devil present
[1:43:38] another image we gotta stop getting
[1:43:40] these little doubts in our mind
[1:43:41] when we see the failures of life and the
[1:43:44] cares of life and we gotta say lord
[1:43:46] open my eyes change my seeing
[1:43:50] change my seeing lord you said you would
[1:43:53] be here with me
[1:43:54] i know you are open my eyes lord i want
[1:43:58] to ask you saying
[1:43:59] when was the last time you prayed a
[1:44:00] prayer like that open
[1:44:02] my eyes lord i want to see you
[1:44:07] but we prayed for better jobs and we
[1:44:09] prayed for this and we prayed for that
[1:44:10] what we need to pray for is to see jesus
[1:44:13] christ
[1:44:14] in a clearer vision sorry for yelling at
[1:44:20] you
[1:44:22] oh hallelujah and on the other hand even
[1:44:24] though i've spoke those words and i
[1:44:26] don't back up on them i want to tell you
[1:44:27] rejoice today
[1:44:29] because our seeing has been changed we
[1:44:31] see this word for the hour
[1:44:33] we see a revealed gospel it's not just
[1:44:36] this same old tummy rot
[1:44:37] that's being peddled and people call it
[1:44:39] the gospel the gospel the gospel
[1:44:41] come to our gospel dance come to our
[1:44:43] gospel come to our gospel whatever
[1:44:45] know my brother and sister we serve a
[1:44:47] holy god we serve a righteous god
[1:44:50] and he wants a holy people and a
[1:44:52] righteous people to serve him
[1:44:54] one that will stand up and say lord
[1:44:55] correct me
[1:44:58] you know how painful that is brother
[1:45:00] chris when he preached the other day
[1:45:02] i don't remember the exact context
[1:45:03] forgive me but he was talking about
[1:45:06] something and he said huh and that's
[1:45:07] like praying for patience
[1:45:10] well brother chris i wasn't here at
[1:45:12] service but i was there going that's
[1:45:14] right
[1:45:15] and it takes almost an act of god for us
[1:45:18] insincere to say lord give me more
[1:45:20] patience
[1:45:22] yeah that's right brother trevor we
[1:45:25] should be praying
[1:45:26] in sincerity lord whatever he takes lord
[1:45:30] hallelujah whatever it takes lord
[1:45:33] i want to have the right ingredients
[1:45:42] sister jerry made a
[1:45:47] carrot cake yesterday i tell on you
[1:45:50] brother jason
[1:45:55] for aesthetics i think is the reason she
[1:45:57] cut off one layer one
[1:45:59] portion of the cake so it set flat on
[1:46:02] the plate i think
[1:46:03] you know we don't want any of them cakes
[1:46:04] that got a big hump in them
[1:46:06] it's got to look good and that's laying
[1:46:09] there on a
[1:46:10] on a plate
[1:46:14] jason said is that to eat
[1:46:18] i said i think that's what she made it
[1:46:19] for
[1:46:23] brother jason said i'll cut it right
[1:46:24] here and you take the other half
[1:46:29] i have to admit i agreed but then i
[1:46:32] think he felt bad so he cut it in
[1:46:34] quarters
[1:46:38] put a little frosting on it tasted good
[1:46:40] i i just i don't want to draw your mind
[1:46:41] to food but we are closing
[1:46:45] last night we're getting in bed and
[1:46:46] sister jerry says i should have just let
[1:46:47] you eat the cake i
[1:46:49] i don't know what i did wrong i think
[1:46:50] it's a little dry
[1:46:57] let's go do it
[1:47:00] let's not talk about tomorrow let's not
[1:47:02] talk about next week
[1:47:04] let's get our jammies on and let's go in
[1:47:06] the kitchen right now and let's eat a
[1:47:07] cake
[1:47:08] and she's like no no i wasn't serious
[1:47:13] now i say this in humor saints
[1:47:16] i want to know what's stopping you from
[1:47:18] getting out of your chair right now
[1:47:20] and taking the good word of god and
[1:47:23] digging into that and eating it oh the
[1:47:27] pastor's a little emotional he gets
[1:47:29] excited
[1:47:30] oh there's this and i don't want to
[1:47:31] embarrass myself there's this and
[1:47:32] there's this
[1:47:33] this go ahead sit back i'll eat the cake
[1:47:35] and i'll tell you how it was
[1:47:37] you see my brother and sister the day is
[1:47:39] too far the forest spent
[1:47:41] day as far spent day is far spent
[1:47:44] there's no more time for when we get the
[1:47:46] right preacher and we get the right
[1:47:47] meetings we get to write this
[1:47:48] if the word says it ask god to open your
[1:47:51] eyes to it
[1:47:52] stand up take the word hallelujah
[1:47:55] take the book and eat it hallelujah
[1:48:00] because you know what i'll get a little
[1:48:02] off track here

[1:48:07] this day
[1:48:11] feel free to speak out
[1:48:15] sister jerry's kind of cheating because
[1:48:17] this is the thing we've been talking
[1:48:18] about
[1:48:19] and studying at home hallelujah it's a
[1:48:22] message of this hour my brother and
[1:48:23] sister we say we're looking for jesus
[1:48:25] christ
[1:48:26] i found him found him i found him i
[1:48:29] found him
[1:48:29] i found him he come down poured himself
[1:48:33] into the bride do you get this follow a
[1:48:35] scriptural
[1:48:36] all that he was he poured into christ
[1:48:37] all the christ was he poured into the
[1:48:39] church which is you and i the bride
[1:48:41] so we are all that god is today
[1:48:44] and so when god said i'm going to
[1:48:46] present myself to the world in laodicea
[1:48:49] my brother and sister he's not going to
[1:48:51] come down as a burning light on a
[1:48:53] mountain somewhere
[1:48:54] he's not going to come as it were even
[1:48:56] though he come in the cloud don't
[1:48:57] think i'm contradicting that but he's
[1:49:00] not going to come and all of us have an
[1:49:01] individual cloud
[1:49:02] that's right but we all have a personal
[1:49:05] experience christ himself in us
[1:49:07] he poured himself we are the
[1:49:09] representation we are the vision of
[1:49:11] jesus christ on the earth today
[1:49:14] hallelujah amen that's where he poured
[1:49:16] himself

[1:49:20] the gospel
[1:49:21] maybe you went to church you picked out
[1:49:24] this and that and went from denomination
[1:49:26] to nomination but one day

[1:49:36] god i'm a son of god
[1:49:37] you are one with the word you can be a
[1:49:40] son or daughter of god and be
[1:49:42] opposed to the word come on

[1:59:05] out upon the congregation
[1:59:08] and he says you have a certain such and
[1:59:11] such
[1:59:14] god's delivered you
[1:59:17] we would just be thank you lord
[1:59:22] but that same god is
[1:59:25] in this building this morning
[1:59:37] satan i bind you in the name of jesus
[1:59:39] christ
[1:59:40] whatever your story is
[1:59:43] satan i bind you lord i claim my
[1:59:46] deliverance in the name of jesus christ
[1:59:49] you see satan will walk out victorious
[1:59:51] if you say
[1:59:52] well as soon as this happens i'll be
[1:59:55] free
[1:59:56] well you know what
[2:00:01] he'll be like you know we've all seen
[2:00:04] heard red
[2:00:06] man with the deck of cards pick a card
[2:00:09] any card have you ever seen that
[2:00:13] you pull a card out don't show me the
[2:00:15] card
[2:00:19] he takes the deck of cards pulls out a
[2:00:22] card that matches your card
[2:00:25] and you say how'd you do that
[2:00:29] you're flabbergasted well what it is you
[2:00:32] shave the edge of the card and you spray
[2:00:34] shellac
[2:00:34] on it and the card that you choose in
[2:00:37] the beginning was
[2:00:38] a card that peeped out of the deck at
[2:00:40] you
[2:00:41] and you said oh there's one that's easy
[2:00:43] to get you pull him out
[2:00:46] but the devil has shaved and slacked
[2:00:50] and he comes along and he handles the
[2:00:52] deck
[2:00:55] there's your ace of spades and you're
[2:00:57] like that's incredible
[2:01:00] and the devil's moving in our midst
[2:01:02] handing out cards
[2:01:04] he's already shellacked him he's already
[2:01:06] shaved him
[2:01:07] and then you wonder why time after time
[2:01:11] after time your trial seems to be the
[2:01:14] same
[2:01:15] trial that keeps carrying on and you say
[2:01:17] i don't have any deliverance
[2:01:19] i have not found relief i don't know if
[2:01:21] god is hearing my prayer
[2:01:22] what you don't understand is the devil
[2:01:24] keeps shellacking the cards and bumping
[2:01:26] the deck and handing you the same trial
[2:01:29] over and over and god delivers you from
[2:01:32] that
[2:01:32] gives victory over that the devil hands
[2:01:34] it right back to you and we said i guess

[2:03:39] to deal with
[2:03:39] us we go to lift a hand and
[2:03:43] [Music]
[2:03:45] kind of put it back down because
[2:03:48] we weren't very spiritual yesterday and
[2:03:52] a husband or wife or children or parents
[2:03:54] might
[2:03:54] think what is what's going on with them
[2:03:56] they're acting all religious
[2:04:01] satan binding that spirit of liberty
[2:04:04] that got over
[2:04:07] but it's time no matter what you've said
[2:04:10] no matter what you've done no matter
[2:04:11] what your circumstance
[2:04:13] if you've got sin in your life saints

[2:04:19] remember it's this simple lord forgive
[2:04:20] me wash me with your blood
[2:04:25] and then when the devil comes to say no
[2:04:27] no you can't worship
[2:04:29] you've got this and this and this you
[2:04:31] can remind them that debt's paid
[2:04:34] it's always been paid i recognized it's
[2:04:36] paid now and
[2:04:39] whether i look like a hypocrite or not
[2:04:40] saying so you you won't under
[2:04:42] understand i'm not going to explain it
[2:04:44] to you
[2:04:47] whether you look like a hypocrite or not
[2:04:48] or feel like a hypocrite or not
[2:04:50] or when anyone who melts might think
[2:04:52] about you god moves on you
[2:04:55] you forget about all the rest of that
[2:04:59] you respond to what god's dealing with
[2:05:02] you receive it
[2:05:05] when the prophet of god talks about the
[2:05:07] ink and the bleach
[2:05:08] [Music]
[2:05:11] you realize he's talking real time
[2:05:13] [Music]

[2:05:30] it drops into the bleach
[2:05:34] and the bleach immediately
[2:05:37] takes effect
[2:05:41] therefore now
[2:05:44] no condemnation to them that are in
[2:05:47] christ jesus
[2:05:49] who walk not after the flesh but after
[2:05:52] the spirit
