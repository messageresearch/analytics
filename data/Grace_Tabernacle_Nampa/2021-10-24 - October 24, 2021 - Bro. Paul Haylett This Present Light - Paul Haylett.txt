also going to have a bit of a pie contest just for fun doesn't mean your pie is bad no i don't want no one to get offended and now that i said that i probably should anyways should have probably even

saturday morning all right bless y'all i think we should take the next step it should be brothers that make the pies we know the sisters can make it so that includes you brother paul [Laughter] we would appreciate you if you made a pie costco anyways we look forward to saturday and we do we do appreciate our ministry this is an opportunity we get a chance to say god bless you and thank you for the many hours it is literally hours they put into us and and for our spiritual well-being and make sure that we're walking down that straight narrow path we we do want to take that time to say thank you sister jerry why don't you come she has a song that's burning on her heart [Music] i stand accused there's a list of my along of all my sins of everything that i've done wrong i'm so ashamed [Music] there's nowhere left for me to hide this is the day i must answer for my life [Music] my fate is in the judge's hands [Music] but then he looks at me and says [Music] i know you i love you i gave my life to save you love paid the price for mercy my verdict not guilty [Music] how can it be i can't begin to comprehend what kind of grace would take the place for all my sin i standing up now that i have been set free the tears swell up and i look at the cross cause it should have been me [Music] my faith was in the nail scarred hands he stretched them out for me and said i know you i love you i gave my life to save you love paid the price for mercy [Music] my verdict [Music] not guilty i'm falling on my knees to thank you with everything i am i praise you so grateful for the words i heard you say i know you i love you [Music] i gave my life to save you love paid the price for mercy my verdict not guilty not guilty not guilty [Music] of not guilty amen and as we get ready to turn the service to brother paul let's sing 173. jesus there's just something about that name amen [Music] i always forget how it starts jesus [Music] jesus there's just something about that name o master save your jesus like the fragrance after the rain oh jesus [Music] jesus let all heaven and earth proclaim [Music] kings and kingdoms will all pass away but there's something about that name sing it one more time is brother paul comes oh jesus jesus jesus there's just something about that name god bless you oh master my savior jesus like a fragrance after the rain [Music] oh jesus jesus he let all heaven and earth [Music] and kingdoms will all pass away but there's something about [Music] i just want to put before you a prayer request that i forgot to share with brother jason um my daughter-in-law stephanie [Music] her sister's grandchild just a few weeks old passed away and i'd ask you just to remember the zimmerman family i don't say this judgmentally but they've been away from the lord for quite a quite a time just pray that the lord would just stir their hearts and they would just look back to him this time you know sister jerry and i was just visiting just a moment on this and certainly don't take this as some over-reaching thought but you know the scripture warns about in that day you know for those that would be with child you know you look at this and you just think lord your will you do all things perfect we know what the prophet said about these little children so we know this little guy is now in the presence of god and uh still heartbreaking just my daughter kristen always uses this word and just the cutest little guffer he was just a darling looking little boy just quit breathing and uh so remember the morales family well as far as that goes remember the joel haylett family the morales family the zimmerman family just look at the day we're living in saints and god's doing incredible things and i have a expectation that we will see above and beyond the miraculous we'll see above and beyond the supernatural and the reason i say that with confidence in my heart is because the word says so amen and that's that's what and uh so uh concerning the pastor or minister of appreciation let me just put it to you this way if you want to show appreciation to the ministry of grace tabernacle say amen to this every single day of your life say amen to this and that will be sufficient reward for the ministry of this church amen to know that sons and daughters of god responding claiming the word possessing it in its entirety not limiting it amen but letting it come in the full authority of the word of god in our hour that honestly saints is what stirs my heart amen i just want to share real quick just a a moment brother alex is working on kind of getting some things prepared on that so we can maybe share something on the screen but just want to share with you that um brother alex sister julia's dad brother sergey senior as i re reference him uh has uh we've been talking a little bit and he just sharing with me the wonderful reports of the saints in the ukraine of the support that you gave uh many of them to be able to attend these meetings to be able to take their children to be able to have an experience of gathering together with saints of like precious faith and you i believe i can speak this with complete confidence you know as well as i do the refreshing it is to be with saints of like precious faith amen you can just as it were the old phrase i don't know where it come from but we can just let our hair down and we can just be ourself and we can worship the lord and just enter in and so um as brother alex has time he's been a little busy but we'll we'll get this and share this uh here soon uh but to just say thank you from the saints uh there for your support for them to be able to be a part of the meetings and we did such a small portion but sometimes my brother and sister god just blesses things in such a fashion that just a few dollars goes and and it has an effect uh you know just brings about things in the lives of believers and and we know it's never been about the money right it's not our money in the beginning people get so so caught up in this deal about well what i did and what i had to do and i sacrificed and it wasn't yours in the beginning amen the scripture tells us that all good gifts come from him the giver of gifts amen the giver of life and so we just are thankful to be a part of a body of believers amen around the world and to just give our little bit of support here and there amen let's just stand as we go into the word today i want to speak to you on the topic or the title this morning of this present light and uh i think that one of the things that has happened in the world that we live in is uh i think we still um now i'm not trying to overreach here and say this is everyone or every situation but i think sometimes we still have a innate uh connection to look back at what god has done we we look back and somebody say well you know i remember when when i was this old god did this for me i'll tell you what i'm interested in saints i'm interested to know what god's doing for you right now amen let's not be a people looking back because if we're careful we end up looking back over what god had done for us and egypt's in the background now this is just an opinion and and i hope i don't offend anybody by voicing it but one thing that i have never liked is to hear believers talk about what a drunk they were and what of this they were and what of that they were i'm sorry that was back in egypt hallelujah god calls out of egypt amen the call through goshen was not hey remember what you did in egypt the call that went through goat motion that night that day was apply the token put the blood over the door when the death angel comes you don't have to fret you don't have to worry you don't have to wait up all night ringing your hands what will happen but you have confidence and you stand upon that and so therefore what i have come i have come to vindicate to you the promised word that is in your future that it's within your grasp and you need to put your eyes on that and don't look back i was such a drunk i was a fighter i was this i've heard people go on for 15 20 minutes 30 minutes talking about what they was and then when it come to and then god saved me done oh let's look forward let's look forward saints there's nothing for us left back here amen now look i i'll just quantify this maybe i say this in my own defense okay some people are just so overly motivated that that's one of the challenges they have in life so overly pushed could you relate to that some people are like oh my challenge is this my challenge that some of us are challenges as we lose like we like to go out we put a shovel in our hands do this do that we like to do this oh here's an opportunity let's approach it but you see my brother and sister it's just gonna burn now god's not gonna say oh i'm just gonna wipe the nature that i put in you out but i'll tell you what he'll do he'll control that nature he'll bring that nature subject to the word and so don't cry about who you are just yield to the holy spirit let him use you for the purpose that he set you here for hallelujah this present light amen let's just turn in our bibles to the incredible scripture uh that i just love as much as i wrote love revelations 19 i love john 1 1. amen you see this scripture here in john 1 1 amen is such my brother and sister that it gives clarity or in the topic that is very prevalent in this scripture it gives light to the whole deity of jesus christ amen it gives light to the whole uh hierarchy of heaven and earth if you would use that term to set everything in its proper order now my brother and sister brother branham in talking about uh these things talking about the godhead uh you know he says now over here we have the trinity and over here we have uh jesus only but brother brown says it's right here in the middle is where we find this how that god chose to express himself in this beautiful when you realize how god chose to express himself is actually if you'll stop and look deep enough is a perfect reflection of who you you are so if someone's out of the reflection of the word then they're actually out of the word in the beginning was the word and the word was with god and the word was god now my brother and sister there are people around the message that kind of have this idea that you've gotta put this in a context but i hope you don't misunderstand me i'm gonna say it this morning and and you digest and if you don't like how i said it then you just pray over it before you come and chew on me in the beginning was the word and the word was with jesus and the word was jesus do we have an argument with that no sir we don't why one the prophet brought a clarity to us that they are one and the same but we have to put this in the right context or we have jesus speaking to himself and then it gets confusing the scripture says christ in you the prophet puts it many many times god in you god in us god is in his word and his word is in you so therefore god is in you so when you pray are you praying to yourself no sir see god puts everything in a perfect order and the same was in the beginning with god and all things were made by him and wait the scripture says that all things were made by jesus christ you see how we've got to get the right balance or else suddenly we have something so confusing that we don't know what to do with it so therefore we default to what we think and we'll talk on that in a moment the same was in the beginning with god and all things were made by him without him was not anything made that was made in him was life you will not find any where else in scripture that defines life is clearly that's verse 4 in him not next to him not behind him not in front of him not coming soon in him was life and the life was the light of men and the light shineth in darkness and the darkness comprehended it not there was a man sent from god whose name was john the same came for a witness to bear witness of the light that all men through him might believe he was not that light but was sent to bear witness of that line do you realize my brother and sister that you should be able to find your own personal identity right here in verse 8. amen that was the true light which lighteth every man that cometh and to the world he was in the world and the world was made by him and the world knew him not he came into his own and his own received him not now my brother and sister you have to understand this in this context different theologians interpret things differently different people but you see he came into his own this would be a heritage this would be a legacy this would not be his own as in a bride think about it as it were his own auntie and uncle his own cousins thinking about it in a normal worldly fashion a grandma grandpa none of them recognized him he come through the perfect lineage because god doesn't break he he has continuity god doesn't break continuity so he actually come and could have claimed a rightful position as a priest except for that terrible little mar upon his life of what all they could see was um joseph mary issue question mark exclamation all of this but through the lineage he could have come and claimed a position in priesthood because you see god won't break that continuity but as many as received him to them gave he power to become the sons of god even to them that believe on his name which were born not of blood nor of the will of flesh nor of the will of man but of god and the word was made flesh and dwelt among us and we beheld his glory the glory as of the only begotten of the father full of grace and truth heavenly father we thank you for your word how beautiful it is how lovely father to be able to look and lord the revelation that you gave to john in that day lord the vision that he had a revelation that was brought to him to lay the words out so carefully father your words father that we could stand here in this day right now and look at that and be perfectly identified lord what a privilege it is to serve you what a privilege to stand and father i'd pray today as every heart would be lifted father may we just reach out to you and lord just accept your lives and have confidence to press forward to the mark of the high calling in christ jesus bless your saints today lord the prayer requests the needs those that would not be with us today lord may your hand of mercy be upon each one lord we thank you in your name amen hallelujah saints you may be seated i wrote it down but i don't know what i did with it which is the same as not having it written down at all but um there is a sister quite a testimony that comes with it but there's a sister down california i think um brother prashant's sister koncha either are meeting with her or have already met with her and so let's just pray and my i wished i could remember that name uh my um but anyway uh just a a miraculous incredible story that goes with this sister's life and uh uh at this point right now to just receive the word of god and uh act upon it quickly when it struck her heart saint she got in the car there was a connection there but she got in a car drove all the way to oregon be baptized in the name of the lord jesus christ you know what that's what we're looking for in this hour not a hey someday i'll get to it or if it's convenient for me but this is something i need to do right now and i actually pray the spirit of the lord would come upon this church that we would behave and act upon the word of god in such fashion that when we would see it in the word lord i just want to be obedient to the word and i'm not going to say lord now if it's convenient i'm going to say lord this is a matter of life and death and i will act upon that so just remember the unnamed sister that i'm sorry i i wrote that down and i know that paper is on my desk and don't judge me for my desk because i can show you where research says that um typical brilliant people's deaths are messy so um anyway verse 4 it said in him was life and the life was the light of men now my brother and sister the only life that really matters to you and i is the original life as the prophet of god preached it we are not looking for life now my brother and sister the the spirit that satan would come and we'll talk about the these counterfeit and whatever in just a minute but you'll find see that satan has come and he has placed in the mind of the people now if you'll study this out you'll find brother branham said that the catholic church was the original apostolic pentecostal church in the first age but within 300 years they had injected traditions and ideas and all of these things that the church did not even resemble the original church now my brother and sister i know it's hard for us to grasp now the catholic church was that well yes it was my brother and sister they heard the word they rallied around the word but then some come and said you know wouldn't it be nice say if our if our if our ministers our priests uh what wouldn't it be nice if we dress them up kind of an honor amen that's why i tell you my brother and sister from my studies here while i make this statement to you this morning you want to give all honor to brother paul don't give him some big robe with a velvet collar and gold buttons and whatever say amen to this word of god that's what god intended not to give honor to create some kind of a ceremony and pump and to give a nice house and a comfortable living and as it were maids and serpents oh that's how we're on no you honor god brother and sister by saying amen and acting upon his word amen but through those ages through that time there they started they injected a little bit of the something here and they added a little something here and sometimes a preaching of the word now i'm not gonna i'm gonna use the word offensive but i hope you understand what i'm saying sometimes uh the preaching of the word can uh kind of bring an offense to us it faces us with our own issues and our own needs and and sometimes that's just hard have you ever have to sit in church and say ouch amen i tell you if we're not i ain't preaching hard enough but instead what we did is we explained it we watered it down a little bit enough and we gave the people an option to come in such a fashion that they would be able to say yes i identify with this i am good with this and my brother and sister that be there you know okay uh this is what i'm doing i'm gonna take a wafer and we're gonna declare this wafer is the body of christ's literal body we're gonna claim that this wine or grape juice is a literal blood so therefore it's uh pretty much unoffensive to anything but a true believer because a true believer gets offended at water downward i'm telling you my brother and sister people are like well you know we just never felt led to leave this group or leave this thing that was happening my brother and sister when it is nothing but watered down putrid that served to the people and people can sit there for year after year and to hear that and say oh no that doesn't apply to me i'm a real believer i'm telling you my brother and sister the filth the putridness of this world will make a son or daughter of god sick now the prophet of god said you don't have a church to go to you go find a holy ghost-filled church and you take what you can from that one that's anointed not one that's compromised there's quite a bit of difference my brother and sister so the original life the only place that we can find leadership see there's no leadership my brother and sister you know even the catholic church has some things i like to listen to catholic answers live have any ever heard of that amen hope you all look at me like brother paul's on the way out no sir it's good i want to know my enemy but the enemy is not the people that's there it's the spirit behind it now i think i've shared this in the church here where this young man calls and he says you know i'm working here at this company and one of my co-workers uh you know we talked about god i said i and i enjoy it but he's talking about these things and the way he described it i thought man he might be talking to a message believer because the the questions and the things that's being discussed and and you know he said now i i see what he's saying and he never gives you know his own thought he always takes me back in the bible and so i'm calling you to to find what is this and so then this priest guy that's on there he just goes into this long-winded discussion and going about this and how is pope gregory and this one over here and this here and that there and he gets all done with about a 15-minute discourse and then their silence and he says well well did that help you and then you hear a voice come not a voice that's whining or whimpery but a voice with some confidence you didn't answer my question well we have to go on to another caller you see my brother and sister god will find that seed no matter where that seed is at and the original life is the only thing that will stir an original seed amen we cannot settle on a compromised word amen aren't you glad of that amen that we could see so the original life's the only place we find leadership amen now we live in an age of the great impersonation now i know some of you gonna look at me real funny amen but when i study things i like to take a good broad view of it remember because the world out here they don't know any different it's the reason you see different is because the grace of god has come down and shown upon you amen otherwise we would be them and if it was intelligence and talent and sincerity they may be you if that was the measure but it's not the measure it's god who calls so you look at this we live in the age of great impersonation you know it's pretty interesting i listened to this deal sometime back not just recently so if you felt like i needed to repent from this i already have but look at this my brother and sister men that can sing like elvis so well that the music authorities when they hear recording of it think it is elvis great impersonation the guy who has had plastic surgery puffed up his cheeks so he looks like a well anyway we won't go there but you see the impersonation is more perfect than the original so much so that people are deceived by it are you with me so you see in the age of the great impersonation my brother and sister i want you to understand we'll take this into the natural just a little bit so you can really but in the age of the great impersonation the scripture says that it would be so close it would deceive the very elect and let's just i know i'm just stirring up the pot right i'm just fulfilling that uh portion as a good minister just to stir up your pure minds okay i'm not trying to come up with something new dig some other message you never saw before so you all go home all startled brother brother paul just dug out a nugget we've never found it my brother and sister those nuggets are there there's little things that come out but amen i'm not looking for some sensationalism of a new nugget amen i want to live the word that has already been revealed and already been made known to us and so we live in this age of the the great impersonation i'll just throw this out it wasn't my original thought but you see my brother and sister i don't know uh some of these backgrounds i can't really say um our family uh catholic and mormon lds and so those coming together my parents deciding we won't don't want to be neither of those so they started out as nazarene moved from nazarene into the methodist world amen come to the message from that so you look at this my brother and sister that it is not really uh uh relevant as it were uh that um uh the time that we're at and say well you know what i think it might be uh the catholic church that will deceive us it might be the baptist church that will deceive us it might be nazarenes it could be the ldfs i'm sorry it's much closer to home than that amen let's not let's not get caught up thinking that something out there is going to come in and deceive you it will be so close to deceive the very elect that means that even you saints will be tested to the degree that you wouldn't know the difference of the right and the wrong the moving of the spirit the anointing the action that would all come but i tell you what we have and i'm sorry i was thinking about this actually kind of crying to the lord why me but look my brother and sister just defeat this it's back to the word that's the only way don't be thinking i'm such a good christian i can't be deceived no my brother and sister it will be the anointing on you to always go back to the word that will be what you cannot be deceived if you're in the word amen if we go by any form of just action that we see we go by any form of anointing that we see we go by any kind of a great spiritual move or actions or falling of the spirit you'll be deceived but when you take a right back to that original word the original life amen and you said under that because remember the prophet of god preaches about this you can be either a rugged flower or a hot house flower the hot house flower has to be preached to in such a way that you're the bride and you're making a rapture you're the bride you're making a rapture you're the bride you're chosen you're special you're making a rapture but i'll tell you what that flower outside it gets a little chilly it gets beat by the wind it has to sit out there when the north wind is coming down and rain is pelting behind it it gets knocked here and knocked there and you might even go out in the morning and find it all leaned over we've had days like that haven't we amen i call it monday but you see we're not hot house plants so we're living in the age of the great impersonation at a time when the original can be reproduced now think about that two-edged statement the original can be reproduced we said right here we've got families we've got children amen the original can be reproduced are you with me hallelujah we all have to stop and say oh lord we've received a message in the hours late our children can be lost to the spirit of laodicea oh no no no sorry the original can be reproduced amen but look at this also that satan comes in and he can take the original and he can recreate something that is so close to the original amen that is so so i like it in each and every fashion amen and you see what it is when one reproduces the original you can reproduce it at such a lower cost that actually people don't want the original because they have to pay more for it you see what happens my brother and sister you go to the store i tell you i was very very discouraged here recently i went to the store i wanted to buy i knew these these tools were out there i knew their original good solid tools last a man the rest of his lifetime using them or there but i went to a certain local store to buy a tool similar that and everything there was made in well you know that place the place where almost everything's made and it was funny because i read a review and the guy says these things are so cheap i broke it getting it out of the package but you know why it's not in the local store because the original cost about seven times as much natural types what amen we can reproduce this at a lower cost we want to be a church that we want to be big we want to be this we want to be that and we can fill this church out i joked about it a long time ago about being sent at that church building program amen they'll refund your money if it don't work they're pretty confident my brother and sister but you see the original has a cost the reproduction doesn't cost as much so therefore it's easier to offer the reproduction at a lower cost you don't have to give up this and you don't have to give up that you don't have to give up your nightlife you don't have to give up your jokes in your club and you're this and that and you can still be a christian quite a bit lower cost oh brother paul that's just horrible but i tell you what it is my brother and sister i don't really even think the club and the dancing drinking and all that garbage is the issue i think the greatest cost that people don't want to give up itself this is who i am and i like who i am and i don't want anybody telling me i have to change i can be a christian and be me and i can say amen to that but you've got to understand the original life shining on the original seed will produce the original word amen you can't shine the original light on a counterfeit seed or you can't shine counterfeit light on an original seed and get any kind of results and people are happy my brother and sister to sit and be a part of the word of god for the hour without paying a price and i could just bombard you with like probably about 50 quotes my brother and sister but you look at this and realize that what is happening we're living in the age of the great impersonation amen so when something can be given to someone at a fraction of the cost it would be considered counterfeit and counterfeit my brother and sister the prophet of god says you know this i'm just stirring up your pure minds i hope you leave today just invigorated from your mind being stirred the prophet of god says wherever you find the counterfeit there has to be an original hallelujah i believe that we as a church my brother and sister not because i think we're all special and perfect but i believe we as a church because of our desire for the word can look out and say praise the lord i am not a counterfeit nor do i want to be a counterfeit i'm willing to be what god wants me to be at whatever cost it costs me to be that amen because if we settle for something that's lackadaisical lackluster something that's just half-hearted if we settle for having our old temper our own nature our own bitterness or whatever it is and say well i'm justified for that this person did this it's not my fault i mean it's your fault you didn't repent from being angry it's your fault for not accepting the original that god has given oh i won't go on on your this was a happy service amen but you see don't go blame it on somebody else because you were unwilling to pay the price to be what god called you to be amen now look the counterfeit is inferior but it's still embraced by the people i saw a little little deal i think jerry shared it with me the other day and that is if you buy stuff made in the usa it wouldn't be stuck on a ship offshore think about that in the natural sense but i want you to think about that in the spiritual sense the holy ghost god himself said i'll be with you even in you and so you're not going to have to sit around and say where's god at and wait wait and wait if you know that god is with you and in you that means he's not off short somewhere that means he's right here not even just in grace tabernacle but in you hallelujah some people struggle with that idea amen but look at that if it's there you know now my brother and sister because it is counterfeit because it is inferior it won't last it won't last i want to remind you it won't last if someone offers you an easier version of the message it won't last this message is built upon the sacrifice of our lord jesus christ for the remission of our sin amen but it is also built upon the sacrifice of our self-will to the will of god the sacrifice of our own opinion our own mind our own behaviors to the word of god oh brother paul that sounds hard it sounds hard no it's not just make up your mind just make up your mind say lord i'll serve you whatever it cost now look look how the counterfeit is so embraced by the people i won't name the artist give no glory to them but when you see someone half dressed big dangling earrings that'll tell you the gender right there well maybe it won't this day after us big dangling earrings with emotion singing amazing grace now brother paul you're you're getting judgmental when you see this same person dressed in different attire but still totally unbecoming of a godly christian woman singing how great thou art my brother and sister this is satan's counterfeit offer for the real thing taking words and making substance out of words well we all do that that's what the preacher does abraham lincoln's great speech would qualify under the same thing but you see for that to be a real substance there has to be a foundation underneath it and so for a life that doesn't line up with the word saying oh lord you're great that's beautiful he is how great thou art but you see the effect of the word has not changed the individual there wasn't any life in that word to change the individual so therefore my brother and sister if it's just words and through anointing that comes with the writing of those songs that is counterfeit because it's counterfeit to the anointing of the original writer of the song are you with me see so just because it's counterfeit doesn't mean it won't be embraced by the people i just received a bit of mail i'll just share this with you a bit of mail encouraging inviting in a certain salesman type fashion coaxing for me to sign the young people of our church to go to this leadership conference a beautiful pamphlet there beautiful little book that they sent me and when it comes to the very back page they're talking about how we're going to make disciples out of them and we're going to teach them leadership and we're going to give them confidence and on the very back page as though this would attract us saints it shows a whole group of people at the beach in bikinis in sweden and hugging on each other and this was a youth leadership no my brother and sister you see that's a representation of a counterfeit am i offending anyone as a representation of a counterfeit approach of what it is to be a christian young people i want to tell you today god wants you to have fun god wants you to enjoy your life god wants you to be full of laughter and joy and and be able to sing and shout and jump and run and do all these things my brother and sister but he didn't say because i want you to be happy and your heart filled with joy i'm gonna throw this away he said no you can be all those things and live this what is it an offering of a counterfeit but you see it doesn't cost much come on saints this might not mean much to you there'll be brothers here that it means something black and decker sold out to what chinese go down to the store here and compare the price of a blackened to decker metabo most people will walk out with a blackened decker but if you want something that'll last a lifetime you'll buy the metal now some of you might be buying chinese tools i'm not preaching at you amen this is a type this is a type amen i see a bunch of brothers going home now they believe brother paul so much just out there in their trash can just throwing these cheap tools in there yeah praise the lord we all we all approach in a different fashion amen i'm just making a type to you hallelujah you want a saw that breaks you can take it back to the dealer sit on the counter and they'll say we'll take care of this for you sir or do you want to have to put your tool in a box and mail it off to post office box 10 232 never to be seen again because those always say it was your fault but when you busted metabo you know what they tell you yes it was your fault but we had grace and mercy on you and we fixed it for free are you with me hallelujah i hope you don't mind that i'm happy this morning amen you see the same as the route the same as the original my mom and the sister so that has to be original right the substitute will never cost as much see now verse 5 says the light shineth in darkness and darkness comprehended it not see the light was called to be on display right the scripture tells us we don't hide it under a bushel amen uh brother branham just i was listening to him uh you know he said uh uh if you were ashamed he's counting the scripture if you're ashamed of him he'll be ashamed of you and you know you can take that now sometimes modern theology and the way they word things uh uh uh is encouraging it helps you and if you're ashamed of him in other words if you i don't want to be identified in him right this is how some new modern translation said you're ashamed of him you don't want to be identified in him and he says you don't want to be identified in me i won't be identified in you see so it's nice you know different translation but it it it it fits you know so what is it my brother and sister the spirit of the day wants to be identified in name only no shame in being identified in name only but you see god wants you to pay the price to be identified completely lock stock and barrel right down to the very last little drop identified i won't say that in public lorne amen so the word prophesies that the light's going to shine does it not we don't have to we don't have to think you know brother paul is just really trying to get us hyped up to let the light shine no that's the word of god the word is declaring the light is going to shine amen prophecy as it were so you see the light is prophesied to shine but see we can't control who's who sees the light that's right we have no ability to control who sees the light that's why one we never condem i've told the story before young man raised in the message went off to the other side of life and behaviors that were just terrible a lot of people rejected him own family pulled back catches hiv and whatever else goes with those kind of things is withering away doctors tell him nothing we can do you're dying his parents say come home son they take him to church there's a minister we don't lift the minister up it's got to be god in that minister or he's just a man talking but he's sitting there in a recliner in the church they have to carry him the deacons would carry him from the car to the recliner from the recliner to the car started coming god started dealing with his heart again he's withered down to nothing but bones and the minister says if you want delivered he's not talking to that young man maybe he was directly you want delivery get up out of your seat come up here get deliverance he's too weak to get out of his seat but the deacons bring him forward and from a repentant heart that is declaring i don't want my idea of life lord no longer want my idea i want your idea of life lord i want what you said was really life and we just read john 1 right in him was the life the light the life and this young man he comes up there with help they pray for him cries out feels something sweep through him still weak but actually able to walk back to his seat under his own strength and from that day on defying every medical evidence there was started gaining weight and going and then when he's healthy again he's gave his heart to the lord he's been filled with the holy ghost and then as the yearning of most any young man would be he's like lord i would like to have a wife but everyone knows me what girl would marry me with my history and god hears the hearts cry and sends a sister in it says i don't look at your past amen hallelujah i'm not going to look at you down by the well i'm not going to look at you open your window overlooking the streets of this city i'm going to just ignore your past come on saints amen i'll tell you what you look at the word of god you'll find that god's done a lot of ignoring of the past because he saw original life in an individual amen and he looked at that and and that young sister come and they had a romance and got married the last i knew they had two or three children my brother and sister because my god is greater than my circumstance and the counterfeit will not rule the life of the original amen no matter how satan tries to stem counterfeit counterfeit counterfeit the original will always show the sign of being original hallelujah and that's why the devil just batters people batters people batters people and they're like oh i can't help it i call lord help me i'm discouraged on this i'm that amen it might be a good sign that the devil's trying to get you to disbelieve your origin amen i'll tell you where the origins of the universe are they're not somewhere beyond the milky way they're not out be on the dark holes amen they're not out beyond those things my brother oh hallelujah amen the origin my brother is right here in you and i this morning there's where the origin is we don't got to look off through the heavens to try and figure this out hallelujah but you see we can't control who sees the light but we shouldn't be so judgmental that we decide in advance who will and who won't because you see the lights doing exactly as the light was prophesied to him amen come on when you witness with your life in this world it says well you know i i just sometimes it's so difficult i'm a sister and i can see people looking at us and oh i work in the workplace and all the men i work with they're just rough cry no no i want you i want you to stop that light that's witnessing is not you that's exactly amen it's him don't be ashamed it's him hallelujah people say well if i had been back then i wouldn't be like those sadducees and pharisees i would have walked out of support of jesus you don't support him right now don't tell me you would have supported him then because you'd be there what you are here hallelujah come on people are like no we believe the message of the hour and then you question what the prophet of god said i'm sorry you would have been right there in that crowd that day saying well if you are sister jerry and i was talking about this now pardon me i'm a little random this morning because i had to just prune this thing like a wild man with a chainsaw but look at this my brother and sister the spirit of that day was jesus hey you counterfeit we're going to just cut her arm and if you can heal her we'll believe you that's the same spirit that's here today and when the word is preached they want to cut it up you have to make this message your preaching fit us and if it fits us then we'll know you're real well i'll tell you how you know the real you take it right back to the original it won't matter personality it won't matter how good of gift they have as ministers that's right that's exactly right it's the word that's it and if they've got to cut the word today to get it to fit then we'll believe it they would have been standing right there with that crowd that day yeah now if you're the messiah we'll just whack her arm off and you'll put it back on and then we'll believe you see the spirit i can prove this saints prophet of god said satan knows how just to deliver this in the right way to each individual one has a doubt and a fear here one has a doubt no fear here one can say well i've been hurt by the ministry well i'm sorry to hear that but i'll tell you what the devil saw that and he's right there to keep you saying i can't trust i can't trust can't trust and i'll take you right in the message if you believe it where the prophet of god said that god would send anointed angels talking about ministry that would know exactly what you needed and would bring it to you but we're there saying no i can't trust you you're not telling the man you can't trust him you're telling god i can't trust you so we've been hurt by the counterfeit reminds me years ago we used to go to a certain car wash you know and then all of a sudden there was a whole big deal of security cameras and always a police car lurking by and and uh i thought man this is weird and then one day it comes out it's kind of sad but a local lawyer son he had a really high class very high dollar printer and the lawyer's son had figured out that printer made such a perfect copy of a dollar bill and if you bought cotton-based paper its image of a dollar bill was so perfect that all the dollar bill dispensing machines at all the car washes in town would take it so you imagine you're a teenager you drive up to this one quarters just pouring out go to the next car wash yeah but the problem was is the holy ghost will never let the counterfeit live very long we might fall for the counterfeit for a moment and the devil just starts feeding it in there look at this i'm getting results i'm getting results until the car pulls in and they're like oh young man put your hands up and the young man's like i didn't mean to be this way i hope you follow me i'm sorry i'm sorry the devil's like wow bummer if only if only if only with only if only well the light is doing exactly what it was prophesied to do saints don't worry about the light let's look at the light let's follow the light amen and we walk in the light see and it's there that we see the light was prophesied to bring us or lead us out of darkness saints come on i know this might not be all that exciting this morning but i felt led to preach this to you we need to walk out of every drop of darknesses in our life don't just walk out of the major things that were darkness in your life but to walk out of every drop of darkness because the word said that we would walk in the light he didn't say we would walk in shadows amen that is scriptural yeah though i walk through the valley of the shadow of death but i'm telling you for there to be a shadow in that valley there had to be light above it whatever was obscuring the word to you there had to be light above that the light cannot be here and the shadow there and it affect you the devil's got to try and put the shadow amen that cloud that that something in our mind in our heart in our life he's got to put that between you and the word but trust me be assured that the light will shine longer than the circumstance the light will shine longer than the cloud that satan has placed in your life hallelujah because why it was prophesied to lead us out of darkness now let's look here right here in the token amen now i kind of modified this because i thought maybe i was getting just a tad bit aggressive can i just preach we've got around the message now such a spirit of denomination we throw the token out like it was just something that's exactly oh that is exactly right yeah my children are behaving this way in that way and they're light lying cheating thieving fornicating bunch of whatevers but i put the token over kind of rough ain't i no i don't want us to get into a counterfeit view of applying the token one let me go it's not my notes so i can't give you the sermon brother branham says before you go to apply the token to others i'm paraphrasing it apply it to yourself amen well praise the lord we're living any old way and we have all kinds of movies and garbage in our house and nobody know our house from anybody else's house but praise the lord i'm gonna put the token over my unbelieving children well why don't you apply the token to the unbelieving parent first amen but when i see the token i'll pass over you it's god's requirement of the hour amen the evening time message now look at this we got a lot of reasons and explanations of what the evening time message is but look what the prophet of god says here the evening time message is to apply the token you mean the evening time message oh let me just make this real complicated for you the evening time message is not for us to try and split the church in half whether the seals are open or not all right the evening time message is not the fuss and fight of whether we this about the prophet or whether we thought about the prophet it's not about whether he's coming back or not it's not about whose voice is the thunders it's not about whether we can explain the church ages adequately or not it's not about all of this stuff my brother and sister it's right here the evening time message is to apply the token because i'll tell you what when you get the token applied in your life the explanation understanding and revelation of all these other things just start falling into place hallelujah it's not like when we have this right then we can go a plot token no when you get the token applied you will then understand these things we got it backwards we got it backwards we got people that think applying oh can i say this i'm sorry to be painful maybe i'm the only one feeling the pain i don't know we got people that think applying the token is declaring that god sent a prophet come on saints let's dispel these myths let's get them out of the way let's go back to the word i want original i want original you know it's kind of weird you know you stop it you're traveling you stop at a place there's chester's chicken well i don't know about chester's chicken walk in there and on their menu they have jalapeno ranch dipped something chicken and they've got this one mariachi blah blah chicken and they've got this kind of chicken and they got that kind of chicken and i'm like oh my can i just have some original oh sorry we're all out of the original but then we go to church are you with me you got your seat belts on we got this version i'll take it we got this version i want some we got this version hey i'll take that anybody want the original too boring satan's throat all kinds of counterfeits of shaking hands and evidences and everything like that forget it the hour has arrived that the token itself not some counterfeit make-believe substitutionary anything the hour is here when the token himself oh we've got it down like it's some kind of event like you know i've had brothers say well you know token like the prophet of god talked about the train station and he'd pull a coin out see you know we just have to apply this token then i went to some church services my wife was with me and there's people there they've done they've labored they've done all these things in the church oh do i even go there lord i don't want to offend you or anyone else but they're handing out tokens for service sisters i'm not insulting you please believe me but they're calling names will sister so-and-so come receive her medal i think they call them sitting not too far in front of us sister nadia they get up out of their chair and they're walking down to the front of the church should have left them shoes underneath the deal it wouldn't be near as embarrassing to walk up front barefooted as it is to mince your way to the front of the church and i'm just going to go ahead and be blunt and you almost feel as a minister that right in front of us of a different church not our church not when we come yeah you want to jump up and say here sister can you just kind of tuck that in there because and then go on and on about these tokens and what they represent brother sisters i want the token that we're applying to be jesus christ the very life of christ applied to me lord that's the token i want right there your word just give me your word lord the hour is here when the token himself is identifying himself right among us and proving that he is the same jesus today and forever and he's right with amen you know what happened saints started off i want to explain myself started off a certain avenue of studying and the more i study it just keeps jumping out at me and if you think that i'm redundant and boring i'm sorry please forgive me but if you'll look at how many times go study it how many times the prophet of god says the word go back to be into live over and over and over again this is not like he mentioned it five times and went on on some other topic one of the themes of the message of this hour is the word amen hallelujah am i doing okay is this a ah look forever and he's right with the word it's got to be applied man i can't just isn't it funny visited church one time pastor an older brother had just a habit of holding his bible in a certain way and cupping his hand right here and i looked around and here's all the teenagers and here's all the men and there's everyone in the church carrying their bible [Music] that's right okay i'm going to go ahead and say i wish that he walked around like this with his bible forgive me he's right with the words got to be applied a man that says he's got the token and deny this word what about it see you can't that's right the token has got to be there when i the blood shall be a token unto you now the holy spirit the life that was in the blood is a token unto you get to it in a moment see the holy ghost is the token the case is closed yes sir well thank you lord we've got it figured out right here can we can we just cherry pick one quote saint the holy ghost is the token the very life the very spirit of almighty god is the token to be applied amen if you could say i've got the token and you could fight a buzz saw my brother and sister please go find you a prayer closet because you cannot have these conflicting spirits can't have this conflicting nature you've got to die to yourself pay the price oh i i won't imply this on you but i'll just lift my hand lord help me to pay the price lord i want to pay this price father for the original amen you know reminds me a little story i read i'm sorry i'm just rambling on but it reminds me of a story i read one time a man's walking down the street in paris and this guy you know the old deal trench coat hey hey you would you like to buy a vincent van gogh just a hundred francs when the real vincent van gogh is sitting in a museum insured for 100 billion dollars but i can get him for 100 francs which is the same as would you like to buy vincent van gogh for a cheeseburger but let me tell you something saints the man wouldn't be standing there if there wasn't somebody who said yes there wouldn't be preachers in the pulpit preaching things that are so obviously counterfeit to this message if there was nobody there going preach on brother but here just second sir old-fashioned google my encyclopedia says then um the original vincent van gogh blah blah blah is housed in the what is the name of that great yeah there we say it louver and in shirt for you know i don't know if it's a hundred billion maybe it's 100 million innocence you know what they say revelation but a book you've got there's counterfeit really well we have to decide who's the authority what's counterfeit oh my oh my you know i preached this sermon to myself five times this morning and it didn't sound like this the holy ghost is the token and the prophet says the case is closed you know what's happening i need to hurry alone you know what's happening people are giving up and saying nobody can live this have you ever dealt with someone that told you that someone that was dear to your heart and you liked them you cared for them and they told you nobody can live this and paul said amen i can't live it i can't live it i've never been able to live it but christ in me doesn't seem to have any problem every time i just say lord my heart desire you know what it is you know who i want to be you want to do lord i want to be the man that the light is magnified through me i want you to be magnified in me lord i don't want to hide it i don't want to try and camouflage it i don't want to well i was raised this way young people please look at me for a moment don't let the devil bring you to a place you're in school and people say why do you dress like this why is your hair long why is you or why young man don't you cuss and why don't you well my parents go to a church and this this is what they believe that's what so i have to do it come on the devil might make that story real to you and you might think it's all because of your parents but how about we wake up to the fact that god said the light's going to shine it's going to shine in darkness and god said i want to shine on you i want to make you different than this whole world now if we want to oh my brother and sister i'm sorry i've just lost a marble or a nut or something this morning forgive me but if we want to pull our pants down boys and girls i'll tell you what i was shocked the other day i'm walking down the street and there's someone with hair about as long as mine and they're going down the street and i'm just going to be blunt enough to tell you this thing that is like the the line between your two buttocks in the world commonly known as crack i thought somebody else slapped that boy silly slouching down the street until i got up close to him because you can't you can't run from a fire you can't run from a wolf you can't run from nothing your pants hanging off well anyway and i got up there walking down the sidewalk and got up recited and lo and behold i was shocked it was a girl look how far we've slept this is what we've done what is this darkness and we're afraid and ashamed and embarrassed as sons and daughters of god to be who we are they're not having a problem don't let the spirit of labor to see you get on and be a problem to you my brother and sister they look even of their own people in their own generation let me drive one more example to you i'll hurry up close beautiful young woman just the ugliest tattoos and this man walks up to her and says ma'am uh could i say something to you and she's like sure real nice girl not rebellious not nothing he said what with someone who has been born and blessed with the beauty that you have deface it in such a cheap way my body my choice hallelujah my body my choice lord i love you i'll serve you i'll pay the price for the original seed because my body my choice i'm not gonna let the spirit of laodicea come and dominate where i walk and who i am because i was prophesied to let the light shine god didn't say i'll come down and layer to see you and i myself will walk the streets and shine the light but he said i am here i am with you i am in you and i will shine in this generation because i prophesied it am i sorry if i get a little carried away saints hallelujah life can be hard can't it isn't it those of you have a real easy life i'd like to talk to you i need some pointers we can feel overwhelmed anybody say amen but look at this i want you to listen to these words of david right after i remind you he was a man after god's own heart psalms 143 i skip over that one quote no that's right amen psalms 143 1-12 did we not have that brother mason okay well you could look it up real quick saints if you want to here is psalms 143 1-12 david man after god's own heart hear my prayer o lord give ear to my supplication and thy faithfulness answer me and in thy righteousness enter not into judgment with thy servant for in thy sight shall no man living be justified for the enemy do you have one of those for the enemy has persecuted my soul he has smitten my life down to the ground he hath made me to dwell in darkness as those that have been long dead therefore is my spirit overwhelmed within me and all who've experienced this said amen the devil trying to ride you right down into the dirt as though you were dead huh i thought maybe some of you might might actually kind of recognize this it made me to dwell in darkness as those that have been long dead therefore is my spirit overwhelmed within me my heart within me is desolate i remember the days of old when i was walking with praise in my lips enjoying my heart and revival and i meditate on all thy works i'm use on the work of thy hands i stretch forth my hands unto thee my soul first after thee as a thirsty land silo hear me speedily o lord my spirit faileth hide not thy face from me lest i be like unto them that go down into the pit calls me to hear thy loving kindness in the morning for in thee do i trust calls me to know the way wherein i should walk in you know what the prophet of god speaks not directly from this scripture but he speaks that's when you walk in the washing of the water of the word that place right there you submit yourself yes sir lord just wash me wash me yes i'm in despair i don't even know that i should i can serve you lord look saints there's people that would be in this church right now they say this is the truth but they won't get themselves out of bed and put on clothes and come down here because they think i'm being judged why don't we just come to the altar and just judge ourselves why don't we just take this word that god has given us and just judge ourselves and say lord i have come short of the glory of god lord wash me pour the water of the word over me lord let my life be changed lord because the enemy has driven me down as those that go in the pit he didn't say i'm going in the pit as those recognize no matter what happened amen no matter what happened i'm gods and he is mine cause me to hear the love and kindness in the morning for in thee do i trust cause me to know the way wherein i should walk for i lift up my soul unto thee what is this saints you know what you do when you repent daily you know what your actual act that you're doing when you repent daily well i'm asking the lord forgive me no saints you're actually lifting your soul amen up to him it's not about i said sorry it's about whether you can lift your soul and offer it to him see god never breaks continuity saints people are like well i said sorry sorry lord it wasn't my fault but i guess i'm sorry no no you have to lift your soul that's right amen amen oh where was i deliver me o lord for my enemies i flee unto thee to hide me teach me to do thy will for thou art my god thy spirit is good lead me into the land of uprightness quicken me o lord for thy name's sake for thy righteousness sake bring my soul out of trouble and of thy mercy cut off mine enemies and destroy all them that afflict my soul for i am thy servant now remember saints it's not what we've done that's what he's done for us amen amen but we've got to lift our soul up amen god's not going to come and say you know what i'm going to just force you i'm going to coax you i'm going to bribe you oh how about we do that what all of you that will come to the altar and repent from your bitterness we'll give you uh a gift card to shepards man i imagine we could fill an altar every sunday morning because people would want to go to chapalas but god puts it in such a fashion that you have to face yourself and you have to come of your own free will and you have to come out of the fact that the light is shining on you and you recognize something on the hymn of my garment lord forgive me i don't want this i remember what that was about lord forgive me and you come but it has to be your own free moral agency what kind of church would it be saints i grew up in one but they brow beat you i think sister amy sorry to embarrass you sister emmy but she has a lovely story makes me laugh about the preacher laying on the altar and i'm just gonna lay here until somebody comes up here and repents pretty soon everybody's like brother sergey are you going to be the one i did it last week it's your turn what kind of relationship is that but what about the relationship of walking in the light and the light come shone right down on you and you realized man i didn't do that right and people are like it's such a little thing why are we repenting i had a person tell me this one time why are you asking forgiveness for that such a little thing i don't know but god laid it on my heart you know then the person turned around and threw by saying forgive me right back in my face in a later date well you hadn't been wrong you're the one that asked for forgiveness now what you don't understand is if you want to eat off a dirty plate you go ahead and i took my plate to the sink and i washed under the water of the word and i cleaned it up because i want it off a clean plate sorry saints sorry there's so much been vinegar in today's sermon now look modern events made are made clear have you ever caught that in the title i i've got war in my life i really examine words and their connection to each other see it's not just modern events are made clear i mean that they are they're made clear by prophecy amen amen see a man can say anything but lest god interprets that word see now we have our own interpretation we say it means this saying message identity the same thing people are like no no no no no no brother trevor you don't understand brother branham meant this well i ain't what he said and that ain't what he said for 107 times now you just don't understand you you need to get a revelation i thought i did 107 times worth see a man can say anything but unless god interprets that word so now we have our own interpretation we say it means this and this one methodist says this now people say oh brother paul you shouldn't be so personal or we we know who you're talking about well that's good i'm going to talk about the individual saints get this amen put this on your plate pour all the mustard and catch up you want on it if i was preaching against the person you should throw me out as your pastor but there's a spirit behind every one of these things lovely people you would love to spend almost every friday night with them but there's a spirit behind that's right don't say it paul don't say it and this methodist says this and the baptist says this and the pentecostal says this and the oneness says this and the twoness says this and oh my there you are but god don't need no interpreter he's his own interpreter he interprets his own word by vindicating it in the age that it's purposed for the age that it's given for and we're not living in a pentecostal age we're living in another age you guys quit reading ahead of me block that off brothers it's just hard to really get the emphasis when you guys are saying amen before i've even got to it we're not living in a pentecostal age we're living in another age we're not living in methodist age we're living in another age we're living on up here now if i could just give emphasis and interpret what the prophet meant we're living on up here not down here we're living on up here to the bright age oh isn't that beautiful god gave a whole age just for us the calling out of the church and getting it together for the rapture now look i want to throw this in maybe you'll remember maybe you won't but um what did brother brown say was a unity in the church somebody speak out if you remember i was all just loving each other on the surface right that was all of us superficial that was all of us we believe god sent a prophet no that was all of us with the holy ghost there's where unity comes in the body whoa my goodness now i'll come down here we have the same altar you've got we've got the same offering you've got we got the same everything you've got and go look it up you'll find i'm telling you the truth they come to brother branham just like they come to jesus just like they come to peter and paul and all the apostles we've got everything you've got a man his eyes healed and they're saying that's a devil look at this beautiful anointing for just a common everyday believer i know not what he is but what i do know is once i was blind but now i can see you describe him how you want to i'm going to describe him as the man who healed my blinded eyes and when jesus meets up with him as it were on the porch or the step of the the tabernacle and he's there what does he do declares himself i'm a believer what happened was according to the word and this was not of the devil this was of god hallelujah you see what god's doing my brother and sister he's bringing it down remember the word talks about it brother branham talks about it we're coming down to a time when the tears and the wheat must be separated now if i could just personalize this i've got to close i've got to close can i personalize this to you real quick brother turber stand up here please the wheat and the tear or the tear and the wheat but that's a would be offensive to call brothers trevor the chair so brother trevor's the wheat i'm the chair we realize as the scripture said there's a time if you try to tear the tear out it's going to rip and pull the wheat with it do you see how they treated me they weren't right these people don't have the holy ghost don't believe it don't believe it but the day comes and separation comes and this one starts saying i don't like you if i if i would have took you with me if if they'd ripped me out of the ground years ago i know i had enough influence on brother trevor i would have took him right to the world with me but look what's happening do you catch it saints i want to make this simplistic the terror is now going i don't like you i don't like you there's something wrong with your spirit and the terror itself this is the word saints we don't need to help them the anointing of the light has matured the tear that the tear wants to fellowship with other terror because that's the only place they can be comfortable oh i don't say that judgmental trust me for my heart i stand clean before god but it's a season it's a time and it's going to come to pass and it will cause in separation in the middle of families and friendships and all of these things because the tear cannot stand the spirit on you yes that's the age now living it's my honest opinion opinion that's exactly the truth and this book is a book of prophecy its believers are commanded to honor it to read it believe it's author for every word that's written in there must come to pass everything that's been promised has to come to pass because it is jesus christ in each age the same yesterday the same yesterday it was jesus christ was in noah it was jesus christ and moses it was jesus christ and david it was jesus christ and joseph it was jesus christ the same yesterday today and forever and it's jesus christ among his people today doing the things that he promised he would do in this age it's jesus christ and you know one of the things he promised he said i'll be with you even in you hallelujah hallelujah if we could just see if we could just see the move of god saints to know we were always in him can we say amen foundation of the world but to see that time that god come down fill that little spot that's in the heart that they're not sure what the purpose of it is and then he started creeping out he went from the inside of the heart to the outside of the heart from the inside of this flesh to the outside of this flesh and then he started washing this started washing that started trimming this started trimming that and what did it the light the light of the world do you see this message and your bible the same as you did five years ago impossible i say impossible if you're reading it you're studying it you're praying over it's impossible for it to be the same bible impossible sister emmy would you come that's the only way i'm going to shut up hallelujah well going back to verse 12 many as received him to them gave he power to become the sons of god even to them that believe on his name which were born not of david and geraldine haylett not of blood nor of the will of the flesh nor of the will of man but of god this is how the prophet of god declares you a supernatural people you're not of this world you're not of this earth you're not of this nature not of this spirit because you are born of the word not of the flesh oh my time for one short quote and i find amen hallelujah amen [Music] and she said you are the light of the world this is a prayer now saints oh let me clarify this i cherry-picked this out of a prayer as you said you are the light of the world grant lord that are our lights who are of your service will shine so bright to the others that they'll see the light of the gospel as we live it lord day by day reflecting to them the life of jesus christ as he was on earth full of humility and sweetness yet with the word being lived right through him granted lord for we're looking to you the great one with the switch in the hand you hold the world in your hand you hold old things in your hand and uphold the world by your word oh father let us receive the word will you please lord let that be the testimony and the desire of every heart in here now saints forgive me sometimes i speak things in such a way it might sound like i'm in condescending where i might be i don't mean it that way i don't mean i just want you to see this i want you to see the word living i want you to see that we are the living epistles amen it's not going to be someone else my heart was broke we were down in salt lake with the saints there we ask about a family or where are they at no they've left they went over with another group over here in this city then the brother he said both what hurts the most is this brother that we have shared this message life together looked at me and said if you don't believe it like this you're lost i broke my heart because you see the prophet of god says now in the church age book he says no i think it's in the ephesus young people you go back and find this he says that that's the wrong spirit it's wrong spirit prophet of the age coming he will not say if you don't believe my words you're lost the word for the hour says go back to the word there's the absolute it's not the ministry not that ministry not just amen saints follow christ follow the word the word is here and it's sufficient the evidence the evidence put god on trial the evidence is overwhelming amen what we want i want to be this right here i want to be full of humility and sweetness but i want the word to be lived through me and the word sometimes it's kind of sharp edge cuts to the morrow of the bone we're looking to the great one who's got the switch in the hand and turn on the light amen this is our whole life saying we are the light of the world i've kept you just a little bit long lord forgive me for that but i'm telling you saints we need to rejoice we need to stand up we need to not be ashamed we need to claim what's rightfully ours and when you see the light walk in the light when you see the word manifesto say amen to that that is what will make the difference hallelujah the devil wants to shut you up don't let him he wants to walk around you know you know you've seen these things like what they do in a play or something and they want to represent something so you know they have little angels wings and maybe somebody's following somebody else with a stick with angel's wings on it they you know they're depicting this in the play i saw this in a real deal so don't look at me that way [Music] the devil's following some of us around today he's got this little dark cloud with these little symbols of rain on it and he's just following us around [Music] and we're like oh unto me woe unto me well you know what why don't you just get out from underneath that satan i rebuke you in the name of jesus christ amen lord i'm gonna walk in the light let it come from your lips saint you might think i'm crazy maybe i think i'm crazy but i'm telling you when you start speaking it from your lips it will start to come to pass in your life if you are silent then you can sit back and say why isn't this happening i'm telling you from my own experience would you like to say another couple hours and i'll share that with you i don't think we need to just believe me when you start standing up and saying i am i will i can according to the word you will find that the circumstance around your life will change and you will find yourself quick to speak do you want to be quick to speak bible says on some portion it's good for you to hold your tongue on the other side it's good for you quick to speak lord i need you lord i thank you lord i love you lord i want to serve you lord now i want to ask you a question as we close what does it cost you what does it cost you in life i said amen to the word and i just don't know if i'll even have another amen and be for the rest of the month no sir cost you nothing saints you know where the battle's at [Music] right there there's where it's at you know what keeps you from saying amen to the word you you know what keeps you from acting on the word you you know what activates the word in your life you amen what brings it to pass in your life you confessing and god honoring your prayer did god answer i'm closing i i i didn't lie this all tied together i never put no commas no periods no nothings it's just one sentence [Music] we just read davis cried to the lord didn't sound too encouraged did he didn't sound too much like a conqueror did he didn't sound like he was having a great monday did he but did god forsake him did god abandon him for anything no sir and go study the scripture he kept right on saying this until it came to pass oh hallelujah thank you lord hallelujah well just in case brother david or somebody else preaches this coming week brother david brother chris i i just borrowed this 20 minutes from amen let's just stand sing a little song i'm sorry lord forgive me i don't mean to make light of these things hallelujah look saints i just have joy in my heart i'll tell you how much joy i went to bed last night with one thought on my mind notes on my mind and on paper got up this morning in my mind was this blank that's blank and again and i was like lord what lord what oh i'll go this way lord i'll go this way finally it's like okay lord i'm desperate [Music] now saints turn in your bibles i preach this sermon to you on august the 17th 2014 but we're going to enjoy it again no sir lord gave me an option i started acting on that i started looking at that and i started realizing that's it that's it my brother and sister it comes down to we are gonna walk in this light we're going to stand solid in this light we're going to confess light the light is going to shine through us amen it isn't going to be what i did it's he did he said i'll turn the light on in you and i'm here saying lord you can turn on the light hallelujah i'm going to stand faithful lord you can make me faithful lord i i'm i'll i don't i'm not a person oh my god explain yourself hallelujah let's walk in the light hallelujah [Music] oh forget about the key just sing it hallelujah we'll find the key as we wander along speaking of the key brother brown says in the key to the door he says it's that key of faith that unlocks the word in you and when the key of faith has unlocked the word you know when you apply the key that god will bring it to pass oh hallelujah i want to have more faith lord what do i got to do i got to apply the key hallelujah oh my let's sit down as we go back to our scriptures we'll walk in oh what a beautiful night [Music] thank you lord you're shining around us oh jesus [Music] jesus [Music] [Music] jesus [Music] oh [Music] [Music] us by day and by jesus [Music] is [Music] jesus the light of the world will walk in the land [Music] how precious it is [Music] the light of the world hallelujah i'd like to sing that little song the lord you are so precious to me i don't know the real that's the title or not hey man i want you just i just ask you as your brother is your friend to sing it from your heart lord you're so precious to us let that come from your lips saints don't say well in my heart the lord knows i love him why don't you tell him out loud why don't you tell him out loud you know in fact i think sometimes that probably is the greatest marriage counseling tool that would ever be given to mankind we can buy gifts and these things are good and we can straighten up our bad habits you can pick up your socks brothers and drop them in the hamper and that will mean something to her but when you ever take her in your arms sincerity look her in the face and say i love you i love you would you wrap your arms around the lord jesus this morning just take him in your arms pull him up close and say lord you're so precious to me you're so precious to me lord [Music] lord you are so precious to me [Music] lord you are so precious to me and i love you yes i love you because me so gracious to me [Music] lord you are so great to me [Music] yes i love you [Music] oh please heal up so faithful to me [Music] lord you are so faithful [Music] to me and i love you [Music] you first love me oh hallelujah aren't you glad today the light shining on you aren't you glad today that this very path that we call life you recognize it was a time we were born we were being raised we're headed down a certain road god said no let's follow the light and the light led us in a different direction here we are today saints living in a supernatural world in a world that's falling apart i'm so thankful for the supernatural i'm so so thankful for answered prayers i'm so thankful for things god comes and gives confirmation to us i'm so thankful saint said he chose us it's so beautiful god said what i'm going to bring you right back to my word and then i'm going to so illuminate the word and when you look at it you'll say that's my life that's me this is me and your word lord this is not someone else it's not another generation this is me oh thank you lord for letting me see me in your word oh hallelujah and these are the days of elijah hallelujah let's just praise the lord for a moment you've got time hallelujah these are the days of elijah and we've heard the horse of the seventh angel righteousness being restored and all these are days of the trial a famine [Music] in the desert crying preparing the way is [Music] [Music] [Applause] of [Music] rebuilding the altar of grace and these are the days of the harvest [Music] the word of the lord [Music] [Applause] is [Music] there's not [Music] [Applause] [Music] salvation come there's no god like jehovah they're so caught like jehovah there's no god there's nobody [Music] [Music] [Music] like salvation hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah [Applause] now wouldn't be paul if i didn't ask you saints can we sing one more hallelujah rising up you know as i study the word i don't believe any true minister will ever post make it sound like oh i want you to be in awe of how much time i spend in the word or what i study it's not the purpose of it saints but i'm telling you the hours that we look the more hours i could keep you here and i say that just because it's so real and it's growing and it's more and more and more and more and more and i look at this and i say praise the lord i think we have the wrong idea of what kind of church he's raising up [Music] sorry i just cut off all of my isms my scissors my nothings i cut it all off because i'm going to be the guy lord willing i believe with all my heart i'm going to be the guy it's going to be up there the sea of crystal before the throne of god and somebody's going to say you want to sing another song yes i don't believe i've told him enough times yet i love him and how much i care for him and thank him for what he's done oh hallelujah well as i look out across the land see god's mighty hand for the pride of christ in her wedding gown just like in the days of old they stood in court they turned the whole world upside down [Music] rising up rising up there's a new testament church rising up [Music] [Applause] [Music] now the bible plainly tells how the holy ghost fell signs and ones were done by apostles hands the women's favorites were cast out in the jail they sang and shout while surrounded by the holy angels [Music] [Music] there's a new testament church rising up well let me think it's all long gone and the miracles are done i have some good news to bring to you in the last
