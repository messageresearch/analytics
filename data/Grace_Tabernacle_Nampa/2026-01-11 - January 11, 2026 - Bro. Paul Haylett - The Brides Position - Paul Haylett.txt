If you have a need this morning as our brother David comes, just lift that to the Lord. Amen. [Music] God bless you, buddy. Amen. If you don't mind, I'd like to read a scripture out of Isaiah, two verses, 26th chapter, verse three. Follow up on what was just said. Thou wil keep him. Is there any hymns here? Thou will keep him in perfect peace whose mind is stayed on thee because he trustth in thee. Trust ye in the Lord forever. For in the Lord Jehovah is everlasting strength. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Let's pray. Our heavenly father, [Music] how we rejoice. You said, "My peace I give unto thee, &gt;&gt; not as the world giveth unto thee, but I give thee my peace." And Lord, I thank you. We thank you. We praise you. We give glory to thee, which thy presence is here this morning. Your present among us, Lord, may every individual in this building realize that you are here. You have brought us here. You gave faith to us to be here. Yes, &gt;&gt; we have come here now bringing these requests before you. We're coming to receive from you. And we call upon you, asking you to reveal your word to our hearts, Lord, that we may know. And by knowing, Lord, speak that thought revealed, quickened in our hearts. Speak it and bring it. Let it be life coming from you. For Lord, life is in your body. And we are here, Lord, as ministers of that life. And Lord Jesus, we bring every one of these needs to you. They've been spoken. They've been brought before this assembly. And we by faith say and declare that every one of them and every need be met according to your divine will. Whether it's healing, may they be healed. Those traveling, may traveling mercies. Lord, in every need, every unspoken request be ministered to. In the name of Jesus Christ, we ask this for thy glory. Amen. Amen. [Music] &gt;&gt; Amen. Number 106. [Music] Satan's like a roaring l roaming to and fro seeking whom he may devour. The Bible tells me so. Many souls have been his prey to fall in some weak hour. But God has given us today his overcoming power. Greater is he that is in me. Greater is he that is in me. Greater is he that is in me than he that is in the world. On the day of Pentecost, a rushing mighty wind blew into the upper room and baptized all of them with a power greater than. any earthly foe. And I'm so glad I got it, too. I'm going to let the whole world know. Greater is he that is in me. Greater is he that is in me. Greater is he that is in me than he that is in the world. Greater is he that is in me. Greater is he that is in me. Greater is he that is in me than he that is in the world. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. I'm going to sing number 824. He knows my name. I mean, I just wanted to read. We've kind of gone over this a couple times in the last couple months, but [Music] just thinking of this. This song jumped out at me and I thought of this verse immediately, but Psalms 139:17, you know, it says, "I have a maker. He formed my heart. Before even time began, my life was in his hand." And goes on to say, "He knows my name. He knows every thought." If you read this Psalms 139, it talks about that. But then on 139:17 he says, "How precious also are thy thoughts unto me, oh God, how great is the sum of them. If I should count them, they are more in number than the than the sand. When I wake, I am still with thee." &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. Hallelujah. I have a maker. He formed my heart. And before even time began, my life was in his hand. He knows my name. He knows my every thought. [Music] He sees each tear that falls and hears me when I call. I have a father. He calls me his own [Music] and he'll never leave me. No matter where I go, he knows my name. He knows my every thought. [Music] He knows each tear that falls and hears me when I call. I have the father. He calls me his own and he'll never leave me no matter where I go. He knows my name. He knows my every thought. He sees each tear that falls and hears me when I call. Amen. And then that second verse just rang true with me where it when I wake, I'm still with you. says, "He'll never leave me no matter where I go." Amen. Amen. Thank you, Lord Jesus. Amen. As we get ready to turn the service over to our brother Paul, number 1071. Have your way. [Music] And ask you to stand again as we sing this. Man, I believe that's our heart's desire this morning, Lord Jesus. Have your way in each life, each situation, whatever it would be. Lord God, amen. Have your way. Have your way. Holy Spirit, fill our hearts and have your way. As we wait and as we pray, speak your word into our hearts and have your way. [Music] Have your way. [Music] Have your way. Holy Spirit, fill our hearts and have your way. and as we wait as we pray. [Music] Speak your word into our hearts and have your way. Speak your word into our hearts and have your way. Speak your word into our hearts. You can't believe how this is right on time. Thank you, Lord. Is it good to be in the house of God today? Amen. Just to greet each and every one of you this morning. Amen. Maybe you could just take a moment and turn around, shake the hand of a brother or sister that's there by you. Say those beautiful words of God bless you. Amen. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. [Music] Amen. So, just have a few announcements here that we'll make real quickly. Um, I need to move the youth group one Friday further down the calendar. So, it would be January the 23rd. And hopefully that's not a conflict uh for everyone. Uh but we did have a little conflict of schedule and it's also going to be hopefully sister Julia knows this but uh brother Sergey has volunteered their house for the youth meeting. So uh anyway so it'll be January 23rd 700 p.m. Brother Sergey sister Julia's house and this will be a surprise to my wife because this Friday will be unoccupied as far as that. So, we'll have Grace Kids this Friday at our house at 700 p.m. Uh, yes, you're invited, Sister Jerry. Amen. And, um, communion will be next Sunday, January the 18th at 5:00 p.m. here at the church. And I'd like to encourage each and everyone to come. Amen. It's always a special time, a beautiful time to um, just come in the presence of the Lord. Amen. Sister Sue, got you on my notes here, but you're here, so God bless you. And um so we certainly desire your prayers for our upcoming meetings. Uh we'll be in Chile and Colombia and Ecuador and um sayingings how now the president of Colombia and the president of the United States are talking to each other. I think I feel a little more comfortable to go to Colombia and um we just look forward to that. Those meetings um will be mostly focused towards young people and u uh we just desire for the Lord to lead us what to say. I'm not the only speaker. So I not only to be able to speak to the young people but desire to be in continuity with u others that are there speaking. So, um desire your prayers for that. And um the February the 4th, which is a Wednesday, February the 8th, which is a Sunday, our brother Adrien Stefen will be speaking here at the church. And uh so we look forward to uh him blessing you as we won't be here uh on that Wednesday the 4th and uh February Sunday the 8th. So, please be praying for them. They will be traveling back from a kind of a family reunion in uh Arizona and be traveling through. So, we just took advantage of that to ask them to speak. So, look forward to that. Amen. It's good to be here this morning. I I believe Brother Cody, that must be your grandmother that's with you. Well, God bless you. And I would take that to be Lois's mother. So, well, wonderful. I I might be prejudiced, but you have a wonderful family. And uh so God bless you today, I pray. Amen. Let's turn in our Bibles. I want to speak to you today. Thank you, musicians, on the bride's position. And then you might say in parentheses uh in spiritual warfare. So the bride has a position that she's called to in this warfare. And you know, sometimes we think of warfare in that sense as a very personal thing, spiritual warfare. But when we look at it in the context of what God has laid out in his word, we'd realize that when it becomes so personal to us that we feel like we are slugging it out, we might possibly have taken the wrong position. Amen. So, we just want to look at that for a few minutes this morning. And uh if you would turn in your Bibles to 1st Samuel 17:es 45-47. 1st Samuel 17 starting at the 45th verse. Then said David to the Philistine, "Thou comest to me with a sword, and with a spear, and with a shield, but I come to thee in the name of the Lord of Hosts, the God of the armies of Israel, whom thou hast defied. This day will the Lord deliver thee into my hand, and I will smite thee, and take thy head from thee, and I will give the carcasses of the host of the Philistines this day, and to the fowls of the air, and to the wild beasts of the earth, and all that all the earth may know that there is a God in Israel. And all this assembly shall know that the Lord saveth not with a sword and spear, for the battle is the Lord's, and he will give you into our hands. Heavenly Father, we ask for your blessings upon the word today. Bless each and everyone, I pray in your name. Amen. You may be seated, saints. Now, as we would look at this here in 1 Samuel, we want to not put this back in history. We don't want to put it as in days gone by, a different age. But we want to just come and realize that in the day that we are living there is these spirits and we will just type them to the Philistines that it's there that they would approach. They approach with force. They approach believing that they have the upper hand and they want to challenge uh sons and daughters of God. And and it's not really you and I that he is challenging my brother. He's challenging God himself. And so it's there as we would look at this we would realize that in the battle when we come into a place that we feel like the battle has become so personal maybe we have a few shortcomings of our own that we feel like uh has uh maybe emboldened the enemy but we look at this and when we would stop and realize that that this is not something that you and I we can't go pick up a sword or a spear we can't pick up something to defend ourselves in a spiritual battle that way. But it's there that we'll come and we'll recognize that right here is a beautiful pattern or recipe, you might say, on how to deal with the enemy. We don't come talking of our own strength, of our own spirituality, but it's there that we come and take the position of what our God is going to do for us, has already promised to do for us. And this day, he says, the Lord will deliver thee into mine hand. and I will smite me. And it's not us, my brother and sister, but God has always used uh his people. He's always expressed himself through his people of what he is going to do, what he has done. And it's there that it's we would look at this and he's talking about taking thine head from thee. And I I want to type this for just a moment if it's okay uh to to step over into another deal. My brother and sister, we in the world we live in as humans, we we would look and all around us, we'll see that headship is around us. Now, in the natural, we as citizens would be here and there's mayors of our cities. There's a sheriff over the sheriff uh you know, deputies and and there's a mayor over the city. We have been as humanity always under some form of a headship. There is a a place a time and and we come even whether you agree or not but we have a president of our country and and we're under that headship and whether we totally agree or not you go around the world and they'll identify you by the headship that's over you. So you go and and as we have many times went to South America, we've been to Africa, Europe by God's grace. And you go there and almost everywhere you go, somebody asks you a question about the politics of the president. And you know, if you agree, that makes it real simple. If you have a slightly different point of view, uh maybe you will explain yourself, maybe you won't. But you see, the headship is always what identifies us. And here is David dealing with these Philistines and he's telling them he's going to take their headship from them. In other words, he's saying that we have revoked your headship over our lives. You're not going to put your headship over Israel. And I say today that we as sons and daughters of God are here today to clearly let the devil know we have revoked his headship over our lives. Amen. He's no longer going to influence or control us. We are stepping out under the word of God, a promise of God. Not our own thoughts, not what we think we can do, but what God said, "I will do through you." Amen. Aren't you glad that God deals with you personally? Amen. So, it's there that there is a God. Amen. He's not only in Israel. He promised to be Israel a chosen people, but he also said, "I have a people that were not a people, but now are my people." And there we stand on the word of God today. And I say emphatically, whether you have a little struggle, you have trials in your life, we are cutting off Satan's headship over our lives. Amen. And so we'll look at this. You know, some of the greatest struggles that we have is that Satan has convinced us or is convincing us that this is our battle. That we're the one that's in the midst of this fight. And we might even at times say, "I I wish there was someone cared. I wish someone would help me." But you see, if we'll turn it over to the Lord, Amen. we can be convinced that it's not our battle any longer. That we can look at this and say, "You know what? uh what what I'm facing today uh comes down and I'll just tie this back here a few Wednesdays ago where brother David was preaching on submission and and it comes down that we must come to a place that even our trials and struggle of the day we're willing to just hand that to the Lord. That's not a copout my brother and sister. That's not that's not just ignoring what it is but it's coming to the position that God said I want you as your husband as the bridegroom. Amen. and our Lord and Savior. Amen. I want you to just take your troubles and I want you to bring them to me and lay them down and let me take care of him. And I believe that we could testify today that many times when we come and have almost impossible situations and we finally get past oursel. Yes, I'm I mean it that way. We get past ourself and finally give it to the Lord and he comes on the scene and takes care of it. Amen. That's what he promised to do for us. But as long as we hold on to it, I guess the old analogy is is we say, "Well, I took it to the altar." But you see, when we got up from the altar, we picked it up again and took it home with us. I don't care what your situation is. Put it on the altar, walk away, and say, "Lord, I'm trusting you with this situation in my life." Amen. And it's there that God then realizes that we um we trust him. We truly trust him. I loved how that come out in in those uh words there. Uh brother David spoke it. Uh brother Isaac spoke it uh there that it really comes down to a situation of trust. And so when Satan is no longer able to convince us that this is our battle, all the ups and downs of life, strife and struggle. I know none of you ever have any of that. Right. You don't have ups and downs. You don't have struggles. Hey, that's somebody else. Yeah. All right. Right. &gt;&gt; Amen. But see, when we as believers try to fight the good fight on our own, &gt;&gt; that's it. &gt;&gt; Imagine you go out tomorrow and you would encounter not a Goliath, but just say a soldier of our day, a man who's trained day in and day out on the art of warfare. Would we have a chance against that man? I I would say no. Amen. Because that's what he's trained to do. And Satan's had all these thousands of years just his practice on humanity in his battle against the believer against the word of God. And we would go out on our own to fight against a trained warrior, it's not going to work. But when we would go out there as David went out that day, such a beautiful example, and said, "This is not about me. It's not what I can do." Amen. Even the rock that David rocks that David picked up out of the brook, my brother and sister, were ordained of God to be the right ones. He didn't just go scoop some random handful, but God led him which stone to pick. Amen. And he knew which stone would be the end of Goliath. Amen. And he knows today what word in your heart will be the end of Satan's headship over your life. Amen. And when we'll hold to that and believe it. Amen. But as long as we're trying to fight this good fight on our own, we're going to leave ourselves open to the ws of the devil. Amen. Sometimes you hear people say, "Well, I I I'm concerned. I'm afraid of being deceived." My brother and sister, the word of God says that it not possible. That's right. &gt;&gt; Amen. We should have that kind of confidence in what the word says to us that it's not possible. Amen. To be deceived. Now, there will be those where we can't we can't decide who is and who isn't. But for a real believer that was chose of almighty God, amen, has a desire in their heart, the word is very clear that Satan will not deceive you. So, quit being afraid of him. &gt;&gt; Amen. Come boldly to the throne of God and quit being afraid of what Satan might do to you or your family. Uh it would be there, my brother and sister. people. I I was just talking to an individual recently and they're afraid of cancer. And I don't blame them. Cancer is a horrible thing. But I tell you, my brother and sister, there's not one thing can happen to your life, but what God allows it. Amen. He didn't call you to be afraid of what this world was. He called us in the scripture to be conquerors in this world. Amen. I don't care whether you have a sickness or whether you're perfectly healthy, you're still a conqueror. Amen. Because that's what the word of God said you would be. Amen. Now in 2 Corinthians the 10th chapter verses 3-5. For though we walk in the flesh, we do not war after the flesh. &gt;&gt; For the weapons of our warfare are not carnal. &gt;&gt; Amen. So there's not one thing we could pick up today to defend ourselves in a spiritual warfare. Amen. &gt;&gt; But mighty through God to the pulling down of strongholds, casting down imaginations and every high thing that exaltth itself against the knowledge of God, bringing into captivity every thought to the obedience of Christ. Now I tell you my brother and sister, I just may be a little direct here this morning, but one of the greatest battles that's being fought today in the world we live in is the battle of imagination. Amen. See, it's an unwinable battle. Actually, we'll sit here today and you would say, you know what? I I'm just not even going to have those thoughts. I'm not going to allow myself to go off into kind of a fairy tale type world of if this happened, this would happen. I would do this and I might that. You know, it's like one man said. He said, you know, you uh imagine yourself. &gt;&gt; Going to work. Get up. Make it real. &gt;&gt; Amen. And we can imagine a lot of things. People I read a little deal the other day. Caught my eye that people admit or or will acknowledge that they waste many hours imagining what life would be if they won the lottery. Imagine that. &gt;&gt; I'm going to just sit here in a chair and do nothing. I don't even have a lottery ticket. And I'm not advocating you get one. &gt;&gt; Amen. We're not gamblers. But it's there. They sit there and they waste hours imagining if I had a $100 million I would this and I would that. But you see that won't change their life. Amen. So it's there that that is a battle that is unwininnable unless that is that spirit is broke. So it's there. Amen. That battle of imagination is unwinable until it is cast down. This is what the scripture says. Cast down and brought into captivity and full obedience to the word of God. &gt;&gt; Amen. So we have to even surrender our own thoughts day by day back to God because my brother and sister otherwise Satan wiggles his way in. It might start with an imagination that's very simple, almost clean. you might say. And if that is not contained, it will become an imagination that controls their life and causes them to be outside of the grace or the will of God. Amen. So, it's there because I'm telling you, there is an endless supply of topics &gt;&gt; to imagine. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And very few of them are profitable. &gt;&gt; Because the word doesn't tell us to take the word and imagine what it's going to do for us. The word tells us to take the word and put it into action. And when it is in action, God will fulfill it in our life. Amen. As the word says, whatever you confess, your body will obey your confession. It's not for us to look to the pastor, the preacher, prophet, and say, "Now, if he says it, it'll be good." It's what you profess is what your body will obey. And when we come to the place that we're not just imagining we're a bride going to take a rapture, but we believe it with all of our heart because the word says so. The word said it's going to come to pass. I believe it's going to come to pass. I don't know exactly how it will take place. I don't need to know how it will take place. I need to be ready for it to take place. Amen. And when we are ready for it to take place, you will get to see the revelation of Christ in you unfolding. Amen. And it won't be imagination. &gt;&gt; It will be the reality of all realities. That will be what really really shows you who you really are. Amen. So all of these topics that can be imagined over, there's only a few that would be even, you might say, profitable to a Christian. Mostly this realm of imagination is a realm that Satan dwells in. Amen. People have that. Now, I'm going to just say something just real blunt. I hope you don't mind, but I I had a a I I guess you could say a friend, fellow minister years ago, and and he was helping an individual, a woman, and uh anyway, after a period of time, this thing gets all out of out of bounds. He comes, tells his wife, uh I'm in love with her. He divorces his wife. In less than one year, &gt;&gt; him and that other lady couldn't stand the sight of each other. And it come out that he shared with a closer friend than I would have been considered that he realized he only imagined that he was in love. He was seduced by a spirit. &gt;&gt; He dwelt on that. And the more you think about it, come on, imagine with me, &gt;&gt; sisters, you might not relate to this, but you know, if that nice pickup is sitting on the corner that you drive by every single day, the more you dwell on that pickup, you'll go from, "That's a nice looking pickup." Pickups are safe topic. Amen. And uh I I like that pickup. That's a nice Oh, it's even the color I like. I like everything about that. You keep doing that. Pretty soon, you find yourself in another little world about that. And you stop and you look at it and you think, "Well, I I'm just going to look. I I wouldn't I wouldn't buy or whatever." But the salesman, he's pretty good. He says, "Hey, I know you said you're not buying it, but just take it for a drive." Amen. So, you take it for a drive. You go home and your imagination takes you further. Next thing you know, you see yourself with your fishing pole in the back driving out to the lake. Amen. And you see all of your friends saying, "Wow, nice truck, man." And all of this is imaginary. &gt;&gt; But if you don't bring that under control, you'll find yourself with a $8 or $900 a month payment on a pickup that you cannot like or even enjoy because you can't afford it. That's right. &gt;&gt; Amen. And that's how the devil works. Amen. I'm not calling car salesmans devils, but they're close. &gt;&gt; Amen. There's got to be a few real Christians out there, but boy, I'll tell you what, they are slick. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Preachers. &gt;&gt; Yeah. Just like preachers. Oh, that wasn't pointed at me. So, praise God. But look at this. See these things like this, just how how simple these things can be. And we'll look at this. As I said, this quotation, got ahead of myself. There was a man that once made the statement. He said, um, "Imagine yourself at work. Get up and make it real." Amen. There it is. Sometimes we just need to get up and make it real, not sit and argue. I like how Brother Brown put that. He says, "Some would say he's coming on a white horse and some would say he's coming on a cloud, but as long as you believe that the Lord Jesus is coming, you can leave the rest of that to be decided at the moment it takes place. You don't have to argue or imagine what it might be. If we're ready for a rapture, we'll be in a rapture." &gt;&gt; Amen. And that's not imagination either. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. And now in Philippians the 2 chapter. Quite lengthy reading here. Amen. Pardon me. I've been a little dehydrated lately. If there be therefore any consolation in Christ, if any comfort of love, if any fellowship of the spirit, any bowels and mercies, fulfill ye my joy, that ye be likeminded, having the same love, being of one accord, of one mind. Let nothing be done through strife or vain glory. Now vain glory my brother and sister when you look through that and stretch that out would be you imagining being exalted for what you have done. The element of imagination has now come in believing that if I do this I will receive the praise of the people. &gt;&gt; When we come to that kind of thinking we should know that we're on the wrong track. Amen. I don't care what office we have or what place in the economy of God. We're doing it to give praise and glory and honor to the Lord, not to receive praise, glory, and honor to ourselves. So, anytime that we can imagine oursel being exalted over something, if I do this, and you know, I I just we'll pick on preachers. Brother David just set the tone right there. We'll pick on the preachers. Anyway, my brother and sister, you know, if we ever come to the place that we as preachers are trying to preach what we might call the home run, something that all the people are like, "That was so magnificent." &gt;&gt; Everybody, you got to go listen to this little portion. It was so incredible. My brother and sister, that's nothing but trouble for the preacher. If he's preaching for the glory of God and it speaks to your heart, that's one thing. But if the preacher has massaged and studied and moved the words around just so they have a flow and a rhythm and a rhyme and they're catchy and he does that because he wants it to have some impact that he's actually putting into it. &gt;&gt; That might get people excited, but that doesn't have any eternal glory in it. Amen. That's a man receiving his exaltation here when he should be just lifting up and and uh we'll we'll touch on that here in a minute in the scripture. Amen. Let nothing be done through strife or vain glory, but in loneliness of mind, let each esteem other better than himself. Boy, I tell you what is such a plague in the world we have today. The world talks about influencers. Well, my brother and sister, let me tell you, those people who are influencers usually have a very arrogant or superior air about them because they now have thousand, 10,000, 100,000 uh people looking to them for uh what should I fix for supper? Let's see what they say. &gt;&gt; Oh, what how should I decorate my house? Let's see what they say. My brother and sister, that's a kind of a headship. You you might disagree with me and that's good, but that's a kind of a headship because people are not living their life. They're living another person's life out through themsel trying to receive what that person had. Amen. Now, if you already have the idea uh uh you know to to do something in your house, sisters, you like to decorate. Maybe you say, I you know, I'm thinking about doing something like this. I wonder if anybody does that. and you see have somebody else has done that. That's one thing. But I'm talking about when people find themselves being nothing more than copycats of someone else. Now imagine when that spirit comes in the church. &gt;&gt; Oh, my brother and sister, the prophet of God said that, you know, you would find it that if they wear a hat a certain way, they wear a certain deal, they paint their front door a certain color, they buy a certain car. My brother and sister, that's just not what this is about. The only influence we should be exerting on each other is let's get closer to Christ. Let's look more like Christ every day. Will you come with me so we can come together and look like Christ? &gt;&gt; There we can come and be. But we still don't want to be the copycat. We want that word, Amen, to speak to our heart. We don't want to say amen because they said amen. We don't want to do something because they did it. We want to do it because the Holy Ghost moving in your life is moving you into the word, changing our lives, drawing us closer. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And don't say it because somebody else said it. &gt;&gt; That's actually a parrot. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Right. &gt;&gt; I used to have pretty good imitation of parrot when I was a kid. We had a neighbor, young lady. She'd always like, "Polly, oh Paulie, I still am traumatized." And because of that, just that voice, this sounds a little rude, forgive me, but I got to where my only defense was to walk around Polly, Polly, Polly wants a cracker. You talk about something that must have went deeper than I thought. But look at this, my brother and sister. We're not called to be parrots. &gt;&gt; No, sir. &gt;&gt; Amen. This word might come out. We might be saying the exact same words, but it needs to come from the very depths of our heart. It needs to be so real to us that if no one ever said it, we would be saying it. Amen. When no one ever wanted to live it, we would want to live it. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Let nothing be done through strive for vain glory, but in loneliness of mind, let each esteem other better than themselves. Imagine what kind of families in church we will have &gt;&gt; if we look out and we esteem everyone in our presence better, higher. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; More important &gt;&gt; than oursel. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Oh, I'm not talking about us putting oursel down, but just looking and making a conscious decision. &gt;&gt; I'll lift them up. You want to know one of the simplest ways to show that you esteem someone better than yourself? is when you will spend your time praying for them. &gt;&gt; That's exactly right. &gt;&gt; When you're willing to spend this limited amount of time that we have &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; in this life. And trust me, to those that are young, you might not recognize it. You get a little older. Time is fleeting. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I mean, you have a birthday and it seems like it was yesterday and they're telling you happy birthday again. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; That's how valuable your time is. But when you esteem someone higher than yourself, you will take your time &gt;&gt; and you will go before the throne of God &gt;&gt; and you will spend that time as though it was currency, &gt;&gt; lifting them up in prayer. That's when you know you're actually esteeming someone higher than yourself. &gt;&gt; The Lord shows us not to spend our time praying for me. Lord, help me. Help me. Help me. Now, that's not entirely wrong. There's times that you need to cry out to the Lord and ask him to help you. Amen. Look not every man on his own things, but every man also on the things of others. Let this mind be in you which is also in Christ Jesus, who being in the form of God, thought it not robbery to be equal with God, but made himself of no reputation to took upon him the form of a servant, and was made into the likeness of men. and being found in the fashion as a man, he humbled himself and became obedient unto death, even the death of the cross. Wherefore God also hath highly exalted him, and given him a name which is above every name, that at the name of Jesus, every knee should bow of things in heaven and things in earth and things under the earth, and that every tongue should confess that Jesus Christ is Lord to the glory of God the Father. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Wherefore, my beloved, really want to focus on this verse 12. Wherefore, my beloved, as you have always obeyed, not as in my presence only, but now much more in my absence, work out your own salvation with fear and trembling. &gt;&gt; For it is God which workketh in you both to will and to do of his good pleasure. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. My brothers and sisters, let's look at this for a moment. It is not us doing this work, but it's God working in you. Amen. to do of his will and his good pleasure. See, the surrendered life leaves oursel open as it would be to be controlled. People would say, "Well, Christians, I've been told this before. Christians are just puppets." Well, praise God. As long as it's Jesus Christ pulling the string, I'll be a puppet. Amen. Hallelujah. I don't want to have some man pulling my string, but as long as the Holy Ghost is pulling the strings, I'll be a puppet any day of the week. Now look at what God is doing here. He is showing us how that we coming to a place that we have to work out our salvation with fear and trembling. Can I throw a little curveball at you this morning just to stimulate your thoughts? Amen. Let's not put it as the emphasis being on whether the gospel is true or not. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Amen. So many people that are in positions, they'll say, "Well, I I don't know if the Bible is true or not." My brother and sister, a person till he gets beyond that doesn't have anything at all. You've got to come to a place that you know it's true. But the real issue that really comes and effects lives in a way that we don't normally recognize is the fact is whether we're going to trust God or not. If you don't trust God, you are not going to trust his word. Amen. But if you trust God, you will read his word and believe and act on every word of it because you trust what he said. &gt;&gt; Amen. Look at Israel coming through the wilderness, my brother and sister. Every battle, every situation they had was ultimately not whether God was real or not. They would have told you God was real, but they were there and they didn't trust what God said. Now, you can take it even from a historical point of view. Many people have analyzed this. If Israel had completely trusted God, their journey from Egypt into the promised land would have been a very, very short, quick journey. &gt;&gt; But because they did not trust God, they repeated what he said he would do. He's taking us to a promised land. But how can that land be better? I mean, I must admit, I was a foreman on the brickmaking crew in Egypt, and I had a pretty good job. And how can the promised land be better than I had? I had all kinds of benefits. I had paid vacation. I had this and that. Had a little authority. You know, I don't know what the promised land will be. I never heard my parents or my great-grandparents or the stories of those in days gone by saying that Israel was all that great. There was always an enemy somewhere that was right there in the borderland to attack us. And nobody attacked us in Egypt except for Egyptians. &gt;&gt; And we learned how to deal with Egyptians. We're not here to have a truce with the devil. &gt;&gt; And just learn how to get along with the devil. &gt;&gt; My brother and sister, we're called by the word of God to overcome the devil. And about the time you start, as the scripture says, putting your foot on his neck, he is not going to lay there pacified. He's going to fight you. He's going to push back. He's going to bring it to where you're called a radical. He's going to bring it to where you're called, you know, a cult or or some other thing because you just don't fit our box. &gt;&gt; But as long as you just make friends with the neighbor, everything will be fine. Sometimes we can take it down a little too personal, but I'll just tell you time in my life that when people would tell jokes that were not right, even though I could care less about their joke, in fact, many of them were offensive, I would just kind of go cuz I just didn't want to deal with it. But I tell you what, God one day come along in my life and I'm sure many of you And he said, "No longer. &gt;&gt; No longer. &gt;&gt; No longer." They tell their joke. I'm sorry to put it this way, their smutty joke. &gt;&gt; And you look them in the face, not because you're so spiritual, but something inside of you. You look them in the face and you say, "You know what? Would you tell that in front of your wife or daughter?" &gt;&gt; No, I wouldn't. Well, then why would you tell us? &gt;&gt; Yeah, that's right. You got to make a stand somewhere, saints. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; We'll either stand for the Lord or we'll fall for whatever else comes along. &gt;&gt; God help us. &gt;&gt; Amen. So, it's not whether it's true or not. The devil believes the Bible. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; And you talk about being in a tough position. The devil, while he's here trying to get everybody to walk away and trample on the Bible, knows that the Bible's true. and he reads the Bible and he sees what his end is in the Bible. And it's not that he somehow can circumvent his end. He just wants company when he gets there. &gt;&gt; And the more company he gets, the better he feels. But whether we'll trust or not, let's take a moment, &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; today and just ponder in your own thoughts. How much do I trust the Lord? &gt;&gt; That's it. There's so many levels of trust. &gt;&gt; We see them all through the scripture. If you read the scripture in that fashion, you'll see levels of trust through the Bible that range from just a simple take a next step to a fiery furnace or a lion's den. You see, a man or a woman can have all of the word of God, but if you can't trust it, you have nothing. &gt;&gt; That's it. That's exactly right. &gt;&gt; And this will be a little harsh, and I'm sorry our visitors are hopefully not offensive, but my brother and sister, more and more churches are talking about Yes. talking about Christ, talking about savior, talking about all of this, but we don't believe in this portion. We don't believe this portion is important. We overlook this because our church doesn't believe in that. This part right here is good, but this part dangerous. My brother and sister, when you start to part and parcel the word of God, it's because you don't trust God. Amen. &gt;&gt; Cuz there's nothing in this Bible that a real Christian can't say amen to. &gt;&gt; God's word is not to be part and parcelled of what part makes us feel good and what part feels too judgmental. God wants you to make the rapture your own self. He wants you to be in glory with him. Amen. He's not here playing games as it would be a puppet show. But what happens is if we don't trust it, we find a way around it. &gt;&gt; Right. Reminds me years ago I had a friend quite successful in business and there was another man kind of courting him to maybe merge their businesses together and the man come to the man that I knew and says my lawyer has has drafted a contract and um if you want to do this just sign it. and he says, "You know what? I have a lawyer of my own, an advocate of my own." And he said, "I'll take it and let him read it." And the guy go, "Oh, you don't need to do that. You don't need to do that." And he says, "No, I do need to do that." and he took it and and uh left it at his lawyer's office and and the lawyer wasn't there, but he called him and said, "Um uh when I'm done reading your contract, you can come back and get it, and what I will do is all the parts that are directly against you, I will just strike a line through them." He goes back a couple days later, picks up this contract. First page, everything is struck out. Second page, everything's struck out. Third page, everything's struck out. Fourth page, a couple things left. Fifth page, sixth page, seventh page, eighth page, and he says, "This guy, whoever gave you this contract is a thief." &gt;&gt; And I'm telling you, my brother and sister, when we have the word of God, and you start to compare what Satan is telling you about your life, and you lay it down before our advocate, Amen, you will find that page after page of Satan's promises are struck out. Amen. And that's because he is a thief and a liar. Amen. He's come to kill, steal, and destroy. But the word of God, my brother and sister, Satan can say this part ain't relevant. But he doesn't have the gumption to actually be able to prove why. &gt;&gt; All he can do is make the accusation. And if we listen to the accusation, we've been deceived. That's right. &gt;&gt; So, a man that has all the word of God, but he cannot trust it is a defeated man. Actually, now let me put this in Mark 9 and 23. We'll just look at this real quick. Now, the scripture tells us not to change a single word, but I just want to make a point with you so you'll understand. I'm not trying to change it, but make a point. I believe in the right context that trust is fully interchangeable here. Will you read that real quick and just put the word trust in there instead of belief? Jesus said unto him, "If thou can trust, all things are possible to him that trusts." Are you with me? Do do you understand what point I'm trying to make? Not trying to change this scripture at all, but you see, my brother and sister, if you believe it, you can trust it. &gt;&gt; And if you can't believe it, you can't trust it. &gt;&gt; So, what we need to do is not really get down to worrying about all these other factors, maybe we need to stop and focus on it. Do I really trust God? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Would I really give him my all and all and trust what direction he would take me from there? or do I still want to have my hand on the steering wheel? You know, I've said this before. I say it with a little humor, but it's got a good basis to it. Some some music singer a few years ago come out with a song, Jesus Take the Wheel. And and many of you probably never heard that. I just heard it in a certain circumstance. You know, Jesus take the Wheel. My brother and sister, the problem is is we give him the wheel, but we've got the clutch, the brake, and the throttle. Amen. We want to go when we want to go. We want to do what we want to do. We want to do it how we want to do it. However slow, however fast, you haven't really trusted God. You got to give it all to him. You got to let go of IT AND SAY, "LORD, I GIVE YOU MY LIFE and you are in control of it now." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. So once before we go on here, Jesus said unto him, "If thou canst trust, all things are possible to him that trusts." &gt;&gt; I believe that with all my heart. Amen. That if I don't trust him, there's no way I can say I believe him. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Had a man tell me once, he said, "Oh, I trust this man so much. I could just leave my wallet on the table and be fine." And it wasn't me, but I was thinking it. Another guy says, "Just go ahead and leave your wallet there." Well, this guy always went around with a big fat wallet full of money. I trust this guy so much I'd leave my wallet here. Prove it. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; No, I'm not going to prove it. &gt;&gt; Then you didn't really believe it. &gt;&gt; That's it. &gt;&gt; If you can't trust it, &gt;&gt; that's right. &gt;&gt; You can't really believe it. Now, in the sermon, a man running from the presence of the Lord. &gt;&gt; I like this. I hope you don't mind if I inject just a tad bit of humor this morning. But when I come across this, I I just felt humor. Hopefully that doesn't offend anybody. Something like I was told one time a lady said back in the horse and buggy days said the horse ran away with her going from church said what did you do? Said I trusted the Lord until the lines broke. Well that's the time to trust the Lord &gt;&gt; after the lines broke. You're trusting in the lines until they're broke. &gt;&gt; Amen. That's right. &gt;&gt; Exactly right. Hopefully I'm not too blunt this morning, but what are you trusting in today? &gt;&gt; Right there. Ask it again. &gt;&gt; That is the truth. &gt;&gt; We can trust in our youth and our strength until we're no longer young and no longer strong. &gt;&gt; But the day we really should learn and develop what you might say is the habit of trust is when we're young. Then when we're old and weak, &gt;&gt; that's it. &gt;&gt; We have no question in our life about what it is that we trust. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. We ought to solidify these things while we are strong and capable and understanding to be able to know that when the finish line comes, our future, Amen, our eternity is anchored, &gt;&gt; not to come to the time or the place that we are worried about what it will be. I I've shared this with a church in times gone by, but there was a friend uh that was a friend of Joe's and and we went there and the man had had cancer and was on morphine and we had to go a couple times because he he whenever he would get in so much pain they give him morphine. And from there he just was out. And we we by God's grace got there one day and he was right in that perfect picture of of between, you know, his pain and being uh over done on the morphine. And I sat down on the side of his bed with him. And in just a few weeks from the time we met him, he had deteriorated so incredible it was shocking. And he looked at me and he says, "Paul, I want to do whatever you tell me." That's trust. &gt;&gt; I could have patted him on the shoulder and said, "Hey, you've done all of this. You've done that. You're good." But you see, one day we have to face these words that we would speak. We have to face the Lord with what we have given and spoke and ask people to trust in. And I just started at the very beginning and went through the whole pattern and the whole thing and coming down to salvation. And he was there and he looked at me, tears just pouring out of his eyes. He said, "Would you pray for me?" And I said, "No, I won't." &gt;&gt; And he was like, "What do you mean?" And I said, "This is a prayer you have to make. This is a expression that you have to speak to the Lord." And he says, 'But I'm not sure I know the words.' And I said, 'I might coach you on the words, but I believe the Lord will give you the words.' And that man prayed through right there. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. I sat right there on his bed, Sister Jerry, right there with his wife, and he prayed through on that. And his wife's testimony after he passed away is from that moment, my brother and sister, not a day or two, a week, A MONTH, A YEAR. FROM THAT MOMENT, HE NEVER ONCE CRIED OUT AGAIN, "WHERE AM I GOING? It's dark. WHERE AM I GOING? &gt;&gt; AMEN. AMEN. &gt;&gt; Right there, CHRIST COME DOWN, SETTLED that question in in his life. And he said, his wife said when he took his last breath, HE HAD A BIG SMILE ON his face because he had told her, "I now know where I'm going." &gt;&gt; Amen. My brother and sister, that's trust. He wasn't trusting Paul. Amen. I spoke the words, but he had to believe those words. HE HAD TO ACT ON THOSE WORDS. AND WE HEAR THE words today. Are we going to act on them? &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Or are we going to offer an alternative to it? &gt;&gt; That's exactly right. &gt;&gt; An explanation. &gt;&gt; Right. &gt;&gt; You see, it all comes down whether we trust or not. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; This lady that he's quoting there, she was trusting God as long as she was in control of that horse. But when the line broke, &gt;&gt; doesn't really say what she did from there, but I'm assuming she got a little bit anxious. &gt;&gt; Trust oursel. &gt;&gt; How could we trust ourselves? &gt;&gt; Exactly. &gt;&gt; Born in sin, shaped in iniquity, come into the world, speaking lies, &gt;&gt; our only way out is the blood of Jesus Christ. My brother and sister, we need to come to the place that we quit saying, "I believe," unless we're going to act on it. &gt;&gt; We're not really believers if we're not willing to act on the word. &gt;&gt; We need to come along and say, "You know what? I believe this and it's not fitting in my life right now, but I'm going to change my life to fit the word of God." &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. And I hope I'm not being too too blunt, but I think there's a point in time we have to just, you know, as the old phrase goes, we have to pay the fiddler. Amen. I I just rather pay the fiddler right now while I'm able to pay the fiddler than to come to a place in my life &gt;&gt; that I can't pay the fiddler. &gt;&gt; And I owe him. &gt;&gt; That's it. &gt;&gt; You see, spiritual warfare will bring you to a showdown. Period. Yeah. &gt;&gt; I don't care what church we go to, how many generations of our family have been in that church. Amen. A spiritual showdown will bring you and I &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; to a showdown. Bring us to a place that warfare. And it'll all come down to a simple phrase. It's more complicated than this. I understand. But it'll bring us to that place. Do I trust? &gt;&gt; That's it. &gt;&gt; Or not. &gt;&gt; That's it. &gt;&gt; Yep. Amen. And if I trust, see the scripture, Jesus said, "I'll lead you," as they always jokingly say, "We're sheep. I'll lead you into all truth." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Do we believe him? &gt;&gt; Absolutely right. &gt;&gt; Do we trust him? &gt;&gt; Amen. That's right. &gt;&gt; Then what were we worried about? &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Whether or not we're going to somehow get pulled off to the side. &gt;&gt; Right. Amen. You can't when you have a one-on-one relationship with Christ. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. He can't fail you. He doesn't lie. He's never lost a battle. Why don't we just simply believe him? Amen. And just step forward. Amen. I'm not talking about getting radical. I'm not talking about jumping off on the deal, you know, like the uh person, you know, says, "I I I'm just going to believe, you know, uh to to my healing or whatever and I won't go." And something simple turns into something complicated. And then they turn around and blame God. But God says, "You know what? Here's the answer. Amen. You can go. It's you're not backslid if you see a doctor." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. Now, out in the world we live in, we have some friends and whatnot that are just adamant that you have just forsaken your salvation if you go to a doctor. I'm sorry, my brother and sister. Jesus did not condemn the woman with the blood issue. Amen. &gt;&gt; He didn't tell her, "You backslid woman, repent first and then it'll heal you." But she had faith that touching the hymn of his garment would heal her. Amen. And there's where we're at. If we need a physician, then we know the great physician. And we trust the great physician, but we also been by God's grace given real physicians and the natural side here, doctors. &gt;&gt; So you look at this, my brother and sister, Satan loves to confuse. &gt;&gt; Amen. He wants to leave the people not knowing what to trust. &gt;&gt; That's exactly right. &gt;&gt; Exactly right. &gt;&gt; Do we have a certain sound or not? &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; God has given a sound. He's given us a certain sound. It's called his word. It's called his voice. The Holy Ghost speaking to us is a certain sound. We don't have to walk through life. Do I am I saved or not? Do I am I do I have the Holy Ghost or not? Would God heal me or not? My brother and sister, he said it. He'll do it. You need to trust him. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Natural or spiritual, have any of you had a mind battle? Did you know that a mind battle I offered myself up as a guinea pig to life? And I'm telling you, I would rather work 12 hours physical all day than to have a mind battle. Because at the end of a 12-hour day of hard work, you go home, you eat supper, you take a shower, you go in, you don't even say good night, you just and you're out. But if you go a day, 12 hours of a mind battle, you eat supper, you take a shower, you climb in bed, and you lay there for hours staring holes in the darkness of the trouble that's in your life and the trouble that's around you, of the words that were said and what you failed or what someone failed you. And that mind battle will just drag you on and on. And you get up in the morning and you'll be tiredder than when you went to bed. &gt;&gt; Oh yeah, &gt;&gt; there's the mind battle. &gt;&gt; No wonder Satan loves mind battles because you see, he gets to then exert control. When you have a son of God that works hard, as I described already, prays, goes to bed, he wakes up in the morning refreshed, maybe a little sore, but when you go through a mind battle, when you do finally wake up or do finally go to sleep and then wake up in the morning, the battle's right there raging again. I personally know people who have quit serving God. &gt;&gt; That's it. &gt;&gt; Because they let the mind battle &gt;&gt; rule their life. &gt;&gt; Satan told them, "You made a mistake." I had a friend, he says, "I just can't do it, Paul. Why?" Well, I just find myself all the time just telling these little lies. Oh, hopefully this doesn't spook anybody here. At that time in my life, I just looked him in the face and said, "Me, too." He's like, "What do you mean you two?" I wasn't a preacher then, in case that makes a difference. What do you mean? And I said, "Exactly that. I find myself exaggerating to the point that even elastic can't survive. and then realized that was called a lie. &gt;&gt; Well, what did you do about it? I found me a private place in time and said, "Lord, forgive me." &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; And I got up and I walked away knowing that the blood of Jesus Christ covered that. &gt;&gt; No battle going on. Did it. Is it capable? I did it again. I did it again. I did it again. Will it cover it? I did it again. Will it cover it? &gt;&gt; I'm here to tell you it will cover it. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You stay in the battle. &gt;&gt; Don't let your mind rule you. &gt;&gt; Let your heart, let the Holy Ghost rule you. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So you look at this, my brother and sister. Mental preoccupation is what some medical people call that. &gt;&gt; It's not anxiety. It's mental preoccupation. And it will leave you exhausted &gt;&gt; and it will erode your faith &gt;&gt; to where you're not even sure God is real. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; 2 Timothy 1:7. For God hath not given us the spirit of fear, but of power and of love, and of a sound mind. Look how all of those go together. &gt;&gt; Amen. When you come to the place that you do not have fear, but you have a spirit of power upon you, not your power, but the power of the Holy Ghost. Amen. And that will then change you to where you love everyone around you. And then you will find that when you come to that place with such confidence in what God is doing, your mind settles right down of who you are and why you're here. &gt;&gt; Amen. Not to be morbid, but another man that I knew that was dying. And the question he had is, "What am I doing here?" 80 years old, still trying to figure out why am I even on this earth? Well, I can tell you I have an answer to that. We're here today to prove the word of God. &gt;&gt; We're here to prove that God's word and his Holy Spirit is true and he's in control and he can take this whole physical body, this old emotional body, this old mental body, and he can bring it subject to the word of God and bring us to a place that we can walk out as the scripture would show us very clearly and be able to come boldly to the throne of God. Amen. Nothing unclean can come into the throne of God. But God can bring you and I to the place we have such confidence that we will go boldly to the throne of God because we know that the power of the blood is greater than any other spirit and any other mark. Amen. They talk about, oh, this is a permanent marker. I had a friend prove this to me. I said, oh, this is a permanent marker. And he says, no, it's not. And I said, well, it says it is. He said, I don't care what it says. He went over to his rig back in my painting days and um and he goes to his rig and he he got uh uh xyol xylene and he poured some on a rag and that permanent marker was no longer there cuz somebody had walked through a house we were building and took a permanent marker and every so often just I don't think they were doing it because they liked us. It's like what are we going to do? And he said, 'We going to just walk through there. Happened to be a Christian and just like the blood of Jesus Christ. It's no longer there. &gt;&gt; We can trust Zylene, but we can't trust the Lord. &gt;&gt; That's it. &gt;&gt; Come on, saints. My &gt;&gt; That's it. &gt;&gt; I got too much here. I must have been really You know how you go shopping when you're hungry? You push the card out, it's $500 Costco special. You get home and you find out you do have 10 boxes of macaroni already. Yeah. So, don't go shopping when you're hungry, but come to church when you're hungry. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. See, Galatians 6:8-10 says, "For he that sweth to his flesh shall of the flesh reap corruption, but he that sweth to the spirit shall of the spirit reap life everlasting." Now, I remember a brother one time preaching on this and he says, "Now is a moment of decision. Are you going to sew to the flesh or you going to sew to the spirit?" That's all that matters this morning, saints. I know that's simplified, but all that matters this morning, what are we going to sew to? What are we going to sew our thoughts to? What are we going to sew our actions to? What are we going to sew our support to? We going to sew it through the flesh because the flesh makes us feel good, or are we going to sew it to the spirit and then reap what this spirit would give us. &gt;&gt; Exactly. Right. &gt;&gt; Let us not be weary and welloing. For in due season, we shall reap if we faint not. As we have therefore opportunity, let us do good unto all men, especially unto them who are of the household of faith. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Now, I want to just touch on this real quick here. And I might abbreviate this rest of this service. Amen. It says, "Let us not be weary and welloing." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Now, if you go labor hard, you can be weary in the flesh. There's nothing no reproach there. There's nothing. You You drive all day. Even something as in innocent as just driving all day. Amen. We got brothers in the church here that drive for a living. I know what they're talking about. I know how they feel. You know, 600, 700 miles behind the wheel of a truck. You didn't do one physical thing all day, but just twitch the steering wheel and you're tired. But what happens when we become spiritually weary? That's it. &gt;&gt; We face little setbacks in our life. We judge ourselves too harshly. We put it on the altar, but we pick it back up again. &gt;&gt; After a while, you become weary. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; The question, if Jesus came today, would he come for me or not? If you don't settle that, that will eat on your mind for years. And I hate to be so open in this sense, but I want to drive this point home. I had a grandfather, actually a stepgrandfather, wonderful man. Wonderful man. And as a kid, I would ask him, you know, kids sometimes we don't have any more sense than to just say things. and ask him, "Grandpa, why don't you go to church? Why don't you you you say that you used to serve God? Why don't you serve God?" And one day we're sitting in a boat, middle of a little lake over in Oregon, Analopee Reservoir out of Jordan Valley. And he told me, "Paul, I tried to do the things that the preacher told me about. I tried and I tried and I tried and I tried and I tried and I just couldn't seem to do it. So, I gave up. My brother and sister, don't let the devil bring you to a place where you become so weary in your spirit that the devil says you realize it'd be easier if you just gave up. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Some of our founding fathers of the country made statements like they were cold, wet, many wounded soldiers hungry. And they said, "We have not yet begun to fight." &gt;&gt; Let that be the anointing on you and I. No matter what's happening in your life today, just rise up and say, "I have not yet begun to fight." &gt;&gt; Because Satan would like to just wear you down. &gt;&gt; And part of that wearing down is because we didn't leave it at the altar. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; We didn't actually believe God would take care of that for us. So, we took it home and gnawed on that bone oursel &gt;&gt; for a while. But I'm telling you, the meat's gone from the bone. It don't matter how much you gnaw on it, you're not going to get meat. You're going to get a bone. &gt;&gt; And we're not here. Amen. As the scripture says, amen where the carcass is. &gt;&gt; That's it. &gt;&gt; The eagles will be gathered. God didn't toss us a bone and say no on that for a while. He said the carcass of my word is here. Come feast on it. Sister Ruth, if you would come. Amen. God bless you, saints. Maybe a little straightforward this morning. Forgive me if I was over straightforward. But you see, my brother and sister, if we're going to fight the good fight, you've got to stay in the fight. &gt;&gt; And Satan wants to bring us to a place that we're we're weary. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; We're weary. &gt;&gt; Things didn't work here. Things didn't work there. I prayed and God never answered. Well, he more than likely did answer. We just didn't listen. &gt;&gt; Cuz sometimes a no from God is better than a yes from the devil. &gt;&gt; Amen. So, let's not get weary in this. Let's look at this, my brother and sister, according to the word. Amen. And realize we have a position as Christians, as believers, as the scripture calls us, Revelation 19, the lamb's wife. We're the bride. Amen. We've got a position in this battle. Amen. And when it come down to that time just a a thought you know when when Esther come all that happened there in the book of Esther when Esther come into the throne room the king didn't say okay this has been done well Esther go talk to the armorer and get you a sword get you a shield buckle on a little armor go find Hmon in an alley somewhere slay him and then they will make a threat to the rest of those people. No sir, what was it? The king says, "By my decree, &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; By my decree, &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; we will subdue this issue. By my decree, we will stop this." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; By my decree, &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; My brother and sister, that's what God wants us to do. He doesn't want us to be the battle axe bride. He wants us to be the bride that says, "I know how to fight this fight. I'll go boldly to the throne and my father, my husband will take care of this situation. Hallelujah. Look, I'm talking about everything from our children. We don't got to wait till they grow up and start having troubles to start laying this word in and come right up through high school. Young people, you you need get a good grade on a test. Amen. Your father Amen. Our Lord Jesus Christ cares about your grades. Amen. If you will trust him and commit it to him and say, "Lord, I need help. I'm not sure I can even pass this test. Lord, I've tried, but I I can't seem to." If you'll just trust him and you go in there prayed up as a young person, you'll take that test and you'll come out with a good grade. And you'll be there sitting there, oh, I suddenly had recall. No, by the grace of God, you'll realize God heard your prayer and you are trusting enough to come to him and say, I need your help. marriages that have problems, my brother and sister. You can go to every counselor there is on the face of the earth, but if you don't trust God, you're going to still have trouble. Amen. So, it's better to go and say, "Lord, we submit. Husband, wife, we submit to you, AND WE'RE GOING TO TRUST YOU TO REMEDY THIS BECAUSE YOU DON'T TEACH DIVORCE." &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; But what do we do? We've got all kinds of psychologies and this and that and whatever. Everybody's got an answer to every situation. &gt;&gt; My brother and sister, it's time for us to trust the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. Look at the world we're living in. Hallelujah. You know, I say this a little bit light-hearted. We're no longer living in the day when you are going to hear the Roman hear their armor clanking as they march. We're living in a day. Oh, this might cause some of you to get nervous. I'll say it anyway. Pray for you. We live in a day the government knows more about you than you know about yourself. &gt;&gt; Absolutely. &gt;&gt; And if you don't think, as the scripture say shows us very clearly, that they can't come and just put a halt to this, they can fly into another country, steal a president. Amen. Maybe rightfully so. I'm not going to argue whatever on that. They can go into another country and steal a president and most the country never knew it happened. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; You think the rapture is going to be on the evening news? &gt;&gt; No. &gt;&gt; No. And even if it was, you wouldn't be there to see it. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; That's exactly right. &gt;&gt; Can we just maybe step up a little more to just trust the Lord? &gt;&gt; Lord, I'm here. Could you lift a hand maybe from your heart and just say, "Lord, help me to trust you. I want to trust you, Lord. I I need to trust you. I want your word to be so real in my heart that I never have a doubt ever at any point that you are leading me and guiding me." Hallelujah. Hallelujah. We'll stop there. Amen. Let's just stand and sing a song or two if you don't mind. Amen. 953. Let this be from our heart. Amen. Hallelujah. [Music] How great are you, Lord? [Music] How great is your mercy? How great are the things that you have done for me. How great are you, Lord. Your loving kindness is filling my heart as I sing. How great are you, Lord? Great is your love. It reaches to the heaven.

I in every victory, let it be said to me whenever that is the desire of my heart. whenever one see me go through a trial, see me go through a struggle that they would say that's Christ. That is a reflection of Christ. Amen. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. [Music] Keep your mind stayed on me. &gt;&gt; Amen. [Music] Keep your mind stay on me. Stay on me, faithfully.
