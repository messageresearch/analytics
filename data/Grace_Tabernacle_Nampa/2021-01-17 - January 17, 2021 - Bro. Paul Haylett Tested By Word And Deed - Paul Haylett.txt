to be god amen and when god comes on the scene and we just let him be god incredible supernatural uh i i i'm going to use the word stupendous things happen i mean just beyond what we can imagine amen i just want to share a prayer request brother christian turned in and brother christian i praise the lord when i read this the christian turns this in he says my wife is it demi yes my wife demi has been an atheist for entire life however she has recently seemed to express interest in god even bible stories and has hinted to me that she is considering jesus [Applause] i tell you what i i'm sometimes can be just a little bit abrupt with people and not too far back in time i had a conversation with a man and young man and he was saying well i don't know about god kind of this same this what makes me think of this i i just i'm not even sure there is a god he said i'm just not sure there's really anything we just live and die and i said so have you ever ever even considered being a christian no i mean there's nothing there and it says so i've just got some simple words for you don't knock it till you try it that's right hallelujah i want to finish the last of this just want to pray for her heartfelt and genuine turning to the lord amen what we're going to do brother christian step right up here if you would brother chris brother david brother trevor sister carrie mason i want not just us as a body of believers but i want their family that's around them amen amen the devil will try so hard my brother christian knows the struggle how things will come little doubts pop up and you wonder is truth what is truth where is truth but i tell you my brother and sister every seed every son every daughter of god will come to truth we just need to stand solid have confidence believing amen heavenly father lord we just come this morning we lay our hands father upon our brother christian now lord what is upon my heart is my brother christian will go home and lay his hands uh wrap his arms around his wife and lord when he wraps his arms around her father we're asking you lord just to let just a little trickle father if it would be to start but just let faith touch her lord let something touch her life lord that she would recognize that something in her life is not complete and father i believe that's what's happening even now as we speak that she recognizing something is missing now lord we were all in this case so father we are not judgmental but lord we have come oh lord we have come in compassion lord lord to know that we are sinners saved by grace and it's only your mercies now father taking this lord from a service that your prophet preached lord we now send your holy spirit out after demi lord father we could talk lord for days weeks months and years and not convince her the lord your holy spirit lord we ask you to surround her morning noon and night may she know a piece like she has never known in her life and father made my brother christian and his wife lord i've met her a couple times a sweet girl lord just ask you father may your holy spirit just surround them in their house lord in their conversation in their life may your presence be stronger lord than ever before ever known lord lord may it come and lord we ask now that you would just be with them lead them guide them father lead them oh lord lead them me to truth lord jesus father that is our hearts desire we also send our love father lord strength strengthen faith in the name of jesus christ hallelujah thank you lord amen well we already cracked my emotional veneer this morning amen well saints i want to preach to you once again brother alex will you start by putting up the graph as it were you know i don't always make things easy for brother alex and he keeps meeting the expectations and telling me hey i'm i'm prepared for you next time so amen as we look at this saints as i've said before we'll say again as long as we are preaching on this uh these topics here kind of going down through this we we realize that the very plan of god the will of god is already worked out and we'll touch on that in in a little further in the service that it really doesn't matter what man's ideas or what man's thoughts are that god's will will be done amen god will bring his word to pass he will do what he said he would do amen so we see as the word has said about our lord jesus christ we know that um he is our all in all he is everything to you and i and satan being a part of creation amen tried to assert his part as dominion of eternity but has failed because uh something that is created is subject to the creator and uh so we see satan coming down and while we at least not today we'll be talking about those that are the completely sold out to the devil that would be those that would be into all kinds of absolute satanic worship and and uh those kind of things you know uh you'll see you know i remember it come from my generation you know the world was shocked when ozzy osbourne stood up in front of the world and and said i i worship satan every day you know his music his behavior everything was already way out there people thought he was strange but he was one of the first to stand up and what scared the people was and they realized that their children adored aussie osborne so they were adoring the music of a man who was openly satanic and it shocked the world my brother and sister and they tried to censor him but it didn't work because the devil won't be quieted until he lands in the pit amen so there there are those that are sold out there and we'll just run a brief rundown on this because i'm probably really not going to preach much on them i don't find much interest in preaching on the devil but you'll see those people are completely sold out they're the ones now sometimes saints i think that we ought to catch the revelation that these people sold out to the devil have because they're not afraid to tell anybody anywhere anyplace anytime that they worship the devil amen and yet as christians sometimes we find now i'm not scraping no knees here but sometimes we find ourselves apprehensive about speaking up i i don't want to ruin this fragile relationship or this new friendship or this uh no my brother and sister come on if we just get anointed in the correct effect amen we can stand and we can project christ to the world anytime or any place and so we look at this middle wall of partition my brother and sister this is the place that these humans as it were will come down and they have uh uh had the uh opening of the anointing of the devil has come upon them i won't mention a name because it's not our focus today but i remember a story of a young man he tells how that as a young man he was quite a good musician had a good voice wrote songs and and he has such a desire to be successful one time he went out in the woods and and he went out there and uh bellard and actually got down on his hands and knees like a bull and threw dirt in the air and told the devil i'll do anything you want if you'll make me successful and after that he become wildly successful as an opening to many of the great names in that in that world and uh but there was something wrong and he knew something was wrong and one night traveling down the highway he said a demon come into the the back of the motor coach that he was riding in and stood right there and said it is time to redeem your soul whoa and an angel come in that same room and said it is time to redeem your soul and he cried out to god now he has a different view than we do he still does what they call christian rock and etc but the man stands as a witness even in that world right that you can serve god you don't have to serve the devil and so we see my brother and sister in the middle wall of partition being torn down demons come right into these people's presence demons come and speak to them demons give suggestions and guidelines and demons give them business advice and demons talk to them and quite honestly if all you wanted was earthly success satan could provide it all remember he told jesus if you'll just bow down and worship me i'll give all of this to you bill gates just become the largest landholder in the united states according to the news and um my brother and sister i'm not throwing bill gates to the devil but you see just because you have acquired mass wealth doesn't mean you have anything more than mass wealth i tell you i'd rather have jesus amen all of that won't do him a bit when the devil shows up one day or even if the angel shows up and says it's time to redeem your soul hallelujah so we see this what does it do it causes people that are cold enough we won't even go there today leave me depressed but the carnage they leave behind them right here in the natural shows up in the news constantly amen but you know there's something about that in the end they got exactly what they expected so they have no disappointment they have no no tears to shed they've made their declaration that all i'm searching for is right here right now amen aren't you glad because the scripture tells us if in this life this is our hope i'm going to just paraphrase it then we're men most miserable if all we have is this right here we are men most miserable i'm glad for eternal life hallelujah i want to talk to you today as we look at this what's happening in the carnal and religious blendings coming together and the reason that we graph this out i explained it before but i want to just bring it you see my brother and sister what happens is is we don't have the religious over here with the religious because these anointings are coming because there is a religious spirit that comes from here and the prophet of god talks about how uh in this quote today if we get in gear and get going you'll see that sometimes even real believers get a carnal anointing and so we have to deal with our own flesh i know none of you have that problem but it's people like you amen that have that problem sometimes we just get carnal amen and and we have to we have to deal with that but i'm glad see the holy spirit comes and um you know brings us to a place that we realize man i'm not where i should be amen you know and the thing is is um you know everywhere you go not everywhere you go but a lot of places you go especially in healthcare doctor's office etc you got to have your temperature taken before you go in the door and uh you know i was thinking about just buying one going down here to walgreens one of these places taking one of these health temperature checkers just so that we um as believers could have one at the door and when we come to church amen we don't want anybody usurping any authority or condemn condemnation over you so you could just stop take your own temperature amen but it won't register the temperature we need to take amen but we should be every day taking that temperature lord what is happening saints i'm not ashamed i am ashamed but not ashamed to admit to you i find myself sometimes you know just wavering a little bit on the chilled side just the stress of life uh the cares of life all these things just find myself but god is gracious see we don't have to look down on herself and we don't have to you know just like oh man if i even twitch they're going to think he's talking about me but it's the reality we live in right because in the hot side satan's got only one direction to take you and he's trying hard but god said i'll keep you on fire you just stay in me i'll keep you on fire hallelujah so let's just go into our service today uh once again redemption's manifestation i want to speak to you on tested by word and deed let's just stand as we would go into the scriptures amen i think we forgot a important part today um so good to have brother prashant and sister contra with us amen just a part of the part of the body of christ amen and you know i have to be real careful how i word this so it doesn't come out wrong but i think that um they've been kidnapped uh drug away to a far-off land held hostage there um and uh i i believe that uh god's got his swat team on the way to uh release them from that sometime soon and good to see our brother adam amen hallelujah now the god of hope fill you with all joy and peace in believing that you may abound in hope through the power of the holy ghost don't you love that verse i want to read it again i love it so much now the god of hope amen that's my god fill you with all joy and peace in believing that you may abound in hope through the power of the holy ghost and i myself also am persuaded of you my brethren that ye also are full of goodness filled with all knowledge able also to admonish one another nevertheless brethren i have written them more boldly unto you and some sort as putting you in mind because of the grace that it's given to me of god i've said many times i'll say it again if the apostle paul was here preaching in laodicea they would shout him down as being boastful and arrogant couldn't wouldn't accept a man that could speak with such confidence of his position in the word praise the lord you realize the same confidence that paul spoke of himself in the plan of god should be the same confidence you and i are speaking of ourself in the plan of god so paul wasn't so far out there that it just borders on some kind of crazy thing we're actually according to the prophet of god how did he say that we're living under our privilege we're not being assumptive we're not arrogant we're not presumptive we're living under our privilege i want that to really soak in saints the next time it's time to say i got the victory or to say all is well i guess amen i want you to stop and say am i living at my privilege or am i living under my privilege we could turn a whole nother way and preach a whole sermon right there that i should be the minister of jesus christ to the gentiles ministering the gospel of god that the offering up of the gentiles might be acceptable being sanctified by the holy ghost i have therefore whereof i may glory through jesus christ in those things which pertain to god for i will not dare to speak of anything of those things which christ hath not wrought by me i think my mic is something's happening here i want to interpret that paul is not saying i have exclusive rights but paul's also saying here i'm not going to preach theory to you come on saints we don't need a theory about if we're good people we go to heaven we need the power of the resurrection of jesus christ the very life in us amen not a theory about if everything falls in place and we're good children but the true down to the bedrock facts that we as sons and daughters of god were born in him before the foundation of the world amen we were birthed out of the word amen hallelujah and so paul is telling you i'm not going to preach anything christ has not wrought by me to make the gentiles obedient by word through mighty signs and wonders by the power of the spirit of god so that from jerusalem and round about into i tried to even find a pronunciation on this word i looked it up like five different ways anybody got a guess a lyricum sounds good to me i have fully preached the gospel of christ heavenly father we just ask you lord today come and move in our midst speak to our hearts lord how we love you thank you for this time lord my heart is still moved lord by my brother christian's desire father just ask you to move in their midst father lord let your holy spirit come with such authority bind them closer together as husband and wife than they've ever been in their life bring forth and manifest the life of christ so visible so powerful that it is undeniable we ask in the name of jesus amen you may be seated want to look back into last sunday for just a moment and we remember the great conflict between jephthah the uh you know if you guys ever feel the need to criticize me don't bother i got a wife and a daughter dad you kept saying gideonites gideonites gideonites and other people were like yeah we know what you were talking about i love you no i wasn't throwing jerry under the bus i was just trying to be funny anyway the gileadites and the ephraimites amen that all culminated in a word test we see them now brother chris i was going to actually make a sermon out of the comment brother chris made to me in the four year last sunday and i might still drag it into a sermon but i believe it was brother chris one of you made a comment to me about isn't that interesting that it was at the crossing of the jordan it wasn't some other stream somewhere this all took place at a crossing over the word test can't get to the other side without the word test hallelujah and i thank the lord my because he's prepared us when it comes to that crossing time that the word test will not be something we have to stop reminds me sister sue shared a couple gave me a couple books his presence and and one of them was talking about d-day and how this man was there and and they parachuted into uh normandy and and uh they were consolidating a a a a bridge area and uh they had a little clicker thing and when they clicked that and they got an answer uh clicks back they were supposed to speak the code word and the guy that they were commenting he said you know my friend so and so he said i don't know him how he survived the war because there they are clicking their little thing and only a few feet away is another man clicking it and finally the other man said what's the password and he said i don't know i'm from baltimore though he didn't know the word amen that's not going to happen to the bride the word's going to become her she is the word right we don't have to have some special code word as it were to make it over jordan on that day because we are the word and the word will speak out what it takes for us to go and you know he said later on that same man was in another situation where he needed to remember a word and um actually got shot by the century because it come time to give the code word he couldn't he's speaking in english he goes i don't remember i don't remember the guard just shot him and the guard didn't get in trouble right because that's his job if you don't know the code word you get shot amen so as we look at this we realize how that this culminated in a word test and actually come to life and death in that word test and we see how my brother and sister that satan the great impersonator he he knows how to speak uh he is so clever you know we look at this just taking a quick glimpse of eve we realize how he was so capable of uh forming these sentences forming these phrases putting this in such a way that as he's speaking to eve while he is speaking so much truth he was lying to her and so in that so cleverly doing that he was able to frame the words in such a way my brother and sister he's still in that business today he is saying one thing but leaves the image of something else amen so while he's speaking actually speaking death people believe that they have life and we'll touch on that just a little bit further down just to bring this out how this is but i want to make the point to you this morning that satan's deeds do not match his words so when one would find himself being convinced the words are presenting an image look beyond the words come on saints when the devil starts to to coax people away from serving god don't look at his words look at his deeds you see anyone that would say well i do this for you because i love you then love ought to be what is being produced and satan does not love you the word brings about a love right the word says love is corrective the word says that god loved you before the foundation of the world the word shows us very clearly that redemption is the full manifestation of jesus christ not the manifestation of the mystery of christ it's the manifestation of christ his whole plan is to redeem a bride see he doesn't have to put doctrine he doesn't have to put tenants of faith he doesn't have to put all of those things in there because he could encapsulate that in the simple plan of redemption and that included all of these things that were necessary to redeem you and i amen you see we get it down and say well it's doctrine we must believe this we must believe that that's good we must but my brother and sister god encapsulated that all and could put a title on that and say redemption and you will find yourself in there you'll find yourself a part of the plan of god because redemption is what it was all about it wasn't about practicing creation otherwise he went let there be cool done let's see if i can make humans let there be wow good done light whatever it might be but you see god put together the whole plan my brother and sister so that we could come and i hope my closing quote today will will tie a little of this together with you if we ever get there so we look at this and realize what god is doing but see satan's deeds never match his words now i want to go into romans the second chapter and look at this real quick therefore thou art inexcusable o man whosoever thou art that judges for when wherein thou judges another thou condemnest thyself for thou that judges does the same things my brother and sister that's why i'm just going to put it in blunt terms that's why i tend to shy away from judgmental people because the scripture says that they're actually judging themselves so what they're pressing down on you about they have the same problems much the better that i could stand as a minister and tell you i'm only here by god's grace i'm only serving god because god loves me so much amen i'm only here because he was willing to pay the price for me but not only pay the price for me he has continued in figurative sense continued to pay the price and young people god's grace is greater all of us god's grace is greater than our problems hallelujah so let's just all keep marching together let's not judge one another let's not be harsh to one another let's pray for one another let's lift one another up amen and let the word of faith come and raise us all up into heavenly places because otherwise we find ourselves then subject to the word but we are sure now look don't misunderstand strong preaching doesn't mean it's judging you let me just put that out there strong preaching amen the word of god the holy ghost will tear the hide off of a believer to get him into the right place okay so if you hear somebody preaching strong don't say well he's judging me maybe you ought to judge yourself say well did what he just say apply to me i don't believe in pitchfork religion either right but did you know that in some sense or essence of that it's acceptable you bunch a lion no good rascals i'm not lying and i'm not a rascal what the preacher just said doesn't apply to me what about you [Laughter] so so we don't have to take it to heart right the preacher hammers down on something that doesn't apply to you don't be offended about that like why is he uh i think he was looking at me he said that if it doesn't apply to you just let it go just just let it go hallelujah but when it does apply to you amen no problem just put the shoe on wear it now let me get serious about preaching here we're going to be here a long time my goodness yeah we might be here shorter than you think because i have to dice this thing up amen but we are sure that the judgment of god is according to truth against them which commits such things and thinketh thou this o man that judges them which do such things and doeth the same that thou shalt escape the judgment of god or despiseth thou the riches of his goodness and forbearance and long-suffering not knowing that the goodness of god leadeth thee to repentance aren't you glad this is uh uh encapsulated right here in verse four my brother and sister this is what brings you and i to repentance can i go back and look at this it is the riches of his goodness his forbearance his long suffering the goodness of god is what leads us to repentance oh my it's not just a whim it's not just a little something fluttered through the air and we felt like repenting it's god moving in our midst on our behalf wooing us amen but after thy hardness an impending heart treasureth up unto thyself wrath against the day of wrath and revelation of the righteous judgment of god who will render to every man according to his deeds which is also where i pulled portion of my title today to them who by patient continuance in well-doing seek for glory and honor and immortality and internal life look at this patient continuance but unto them that are contentious do not obey the truth but obey unrighteousness indignation and wrath tribulation and anguish upon every soul of man that doeth evil of the jew first and also the gentile of the gentile but glory and honor and peace to every man that worketh good to the jew first and also to the gentile for there is no respect of persons with god i like that hallelujah for as many as have sinned without law shall also perish without law and as many as have sinned in the law shall be judged by the law for not the hearers of the law are just before god but the doers of the law shall be justified amen blessings upon the word of god now saints i'm going to take into this a quite long lengthy uh excerpts out of the resume of the ages of the church age book and i want you as we would come here to just look at we're looking at these spirits and we're looking at this high breeding and how that these spirits could come it just sometimes doesn't seem practical that a carnal spirit would be upon a godly person uh but it doesn't seem uh realistic when you look at that that a incredibly religious spirit would be on someone that uh really isn't fully committed to serving god so he says right here he said what was planted in the first age will develop in the second age in all other ages until it comes to maturity and harvest we're in that season thus in the sumerian age we expect an enlargement enlightenment of the church corporates history through revelation of the spirit so we're just expecting growth right saints i tell you as a pastor i just fully expect that we week after week after week as the brothers and sisters of grace uh that we grow spiritually we don't want to find ourselves as a church becoming more and more carnal we don't want to find ourselves becoming more and more loose about what we believe and and loosening the standards because we don't want our children to leave and we don't want this family or that family or those to leave so we got to loosen it up brother and sister i fully have expectation that we ourselves now not the minister coming out here and putting out you know as it were like a pole vault or a high jump and putting the bar up and saying here's a standard you need to meet but my brother and sister honestly from my heart i tell you this i have full expectation in the word of god that the bride of christ grace tabernacle would be coming up here maybe you know and even around and if it was figurative here i just be out here going well okay we'll just raise the standard for myself i don't need someone to raise the standard for me i i love the lord i want to serve him with all of my heart there's something inside of me i would come to this figurative standard here and i would be not not telling the whole church hey church i decided this sunday to raise my standard no we we do it it's personal it's who we are we raise the standard sometimes we'll stay at that level for a while go through some hard battles some hard trials and then we'll come another day and we'll raise that standard a little higher you see that's what my full expectation is that's what i desire to see and so here it is thus in this morning age we expect an enlargement and enlightenment of the church corporates history through the revelation of the spirit in this age the hatred of the false vine increases so actually they face instead of a a lovely time to worship god and a liberty that the hate is building up the pressure pushing back is building up now saints i want to just throw this into you that was five church ages ago now imagine what this uh uh apostasy spirit is pushing back how it's pushing back today how much it's trying to hinder the real sons and daughters of god in the day that we live in amen so just take that as a mental note to realize it's had all these ages of building up building up building up and this is what you're facing today is the build up of every one of those ages now you say well brother paul are we are we more important or more spiritual or or anything like that than those saints absolutely not my brother and sister god just poured more grace in amen he didn't make us more spiritual we don't have more holy ghost you understand what i'm saying like we'll get to heaven and they'll all be just like oh if we could have been like you but god's pouring grace in pouring more grace in and we're going to finish hallelujah so this age of hatred is a false mind increases so they have verse nine separated themselves from the company of the true they went out from them they were liars they called themselves what they were not now i want to focus right here my brother and sister uh on this they called themselves what they were not you see we're going to come into a time in this part of my title what what focused me to this title there's coming a time my brother and sister that god is going to judge you and i by the words we speak of ourself it won't be what we claim someone else is there's some people that i i encounter they're just they're so worried about what someone else is going to say about them as a believer uh you know do they have faith are they this or they that forget about that nonsense my brother and sister what they say about you will not matter but what will happen is is what you say about yourself so as the prophet of god is showing us here in the resume of the ages you see they said they were real believers and they weren't so god said i'm going to take you at your word and i will judge you on what you said you were that's why it's important saints now i don't want to scuff any knees here but that's why it's important when we say we're believers let's be believers let's not just say we're believers and just kind of skin along on the surface of this because there come a day god will judge us for what we say we are so what we need to do is say lord i'm just a sinner saved by grace but i believe your word amen don't now don't go below your privilege are you with me don't go below your privilege i'm a son of god i'm a daughter of god amen but let's not take a position like we are it when we're not because without god's grace we wouldn't have got past the first church age amen they called themselves what they are not but did god destroy them it's just interesting see so they're walking around in the churches of the day in the temples of the day in the religious circles of the day declaring that they are god's mouthpiece you would almost think i i i know that it's a good deal i'm not god because it would be just okay done with them no god says you know what i'm going to leave them in place because it's going to all come to the harvest so the full fruition of the word my brother and sister wasn't fast forward six church ages come to the seventh give the word to you and i and we go into rapture it took all seven church ages it took all of the word of all of that time to bring to us to come to a place that we come to fruition and maturity the same is with the vine amen with that false mind so they have to come so when it come there they called themselves what they weren't but god didn't destroy them he let him alone and both will go to the harvest but lord they should be destroyed for they are destroying thy people they are killing them now you guys that read ahead see what's happening you know what nothing i i would almost put it this way almost nothing's more grievous to a sincere son or daughter of god than to see someone inserting something else into the message and convincing people to take that because you're looking upon that and realizing that they're actually killing them people oh you talk about something that just gets you grievous and i'm sorry after i get over grieving grieving i get angry amen and it seems like you guys don't see me grieving what you see is me angry and it doesn't present a good image but the reason is is i would be their calling lord they're destroying thy people they're killing them lord do away with him but you know look what god's answer was he says no let them alone but to my bride he didn't go down there to the one that's injecting uh denominational ideas and injecting man's ideas and twisting the word and perverting it and cutting it off and forming it into a whole other thing he didn't go to them and say whoa you guys stop that he comes to his bride amen and because he knows they've got to come to the harvest and so he comes to his bride here and he says now be thou faithful unto death he doesn't tell him he's already warned him about the false vine but now being persecuted he tells them hey hey look what i want you to do is not spend all your time uh fighting against this finding it i guess just be faithful unto death love me even more the more pressure the more that they're trying to twist this word of god we just love him right to the very end amen and be more faithful and love him even more than ever before amen we learn in no uncertain terms that this false vine is the vine of satan my brother and sister do you realize what the prophet is really saying there he is calling people sitting right in church the antichrist see how god puts it in the word so careful in such a fashion people will read that now you're going to think i've caught myself but that's not us that's someone else so every let me put it in this context every sanctuary every church that's looked at that right there's thought that's not us that's someone else but you see the word will come and prove whether you and i stand on one side or the other of this it gets blunt saints it comes right down to a narrow edge where we can't play games any longer it's not about we go to church because it's fun it should be fun i hope people are happy when they leave church but you see my brother and sister he closes this right here their gathering is of him satan see it's so clever but you know what i want to put this to you amen that it's not even the so close it would deceive the very elect that's not what that is i can make some statements that probably wouldn't be good but they're true and i can back them up a hundred percent my brother and sister hundred percent you know let me just inject this this you'll catch where i'm thinking the prophet of god said i want to come back to jeffersonville and preach the trail of the serpent you know why i think god didn't allow him to preach the trail of the serpent because that would have exposed the spirits that are just now being exposed and it was before its time it would have been out of season it would have just flattened a lot of things when it was pointed out where those spirits came from and god says nope you're not going to preach that i'm going to let it come to fruition that's right nobody has to preach it amen nobody has to preach it it will come to pass do you know i don't have to preach you brother trevor into the rapture i don't have to preach you brother jason brother william amen i have to preach you into the rapture amen the word of god will take you there amen because the word is in you the word will take you there so we don't have to befriend and lift up and cajole and all of these things to get people to serve god because it's in them hallelujah and you cannot turn that away because i was created or born into them of almighty god amen now he says now be faithful be thou faithful unto death love me even more now look don't you love how satan plays the love game amen or should i say it how the satan plays the god don't love you game now i know none of you ever suffer from that symptom but i'm telling you my brother and sister satan just knows right when to wait to come and whisper in your ear see if god loved you if god loved you this situation would have never ever happened yeah well you wouldn't got thrown the lions then if god had loved you you wouldn't have been thrown in the colosseum if god had loved you you wouldn't have been thrown off the cliff or dipped in the oil you wouldn't have been a lot of things if god loved you no my brother and sister satan is a good liar amen he's able to say these things in such a way and the worst thing my brother and sister that's way worse than the devil saying god don't love you is when you say god don't love you amen that's a way worse thing because we should be proven by now right amen we're not last week converts to the word of god we should know god loves us because if not we'd be in an alley somewhere or live in a rotten life amen okay now let me just go on here i i kind of question myself to preach this this way but i just couldn't help myself amen they meet in the name of god now remember saints we're preaching off of our our little graph here we're we're over on what i call the negative side so this is going to have a little bit of that but i'll give you something to clean your palate before we leave church today amen they meet in the name of god and lie that they are christ they preach they teach they baptize they worship they partake of various rights given by christ to the church yet they are not of god now i want to throw out i don't remember i believe that spurgeon says this you know that it's not fair that god would save some and not save others but if we got what was fair we'd all be in hell so we have to keep that in mind right this isn't about what's fair this about what god decided to do amen various rights christ came to church but they're not of god but since they say they are god will hold them responsible and in each age he speaks of them and to them they remind us exactly of balaam he had a prophetic office the prophetic office he knew the proper approach unto god as demonstrated in the sacrifice of the clean beast yet he was not a true word prophet for when god told him not to go honor balak with his presence he sought to go anyhow amen for he was motivated by his lust for gold and prestige so god let him go now you know as god under this you know aspect here we look at this does god ever change his mind no no god no so god let him go the perfect will of god gave way to the permissible will of god because of the heart desire of balaam god actually said go ahead now look at this i want to focus for just a minute my brother and sister of the things that we have to judge now we have to anything in life i i just uh i'll be open with you whatever you know in in my farming and business in life uh we make some decisions that have pretty hefty price tags attached to them i i tell you i actually sometimes i i don't sleep at night i i don't know whether i should or i shouldn't i don't know what to do and uh ultimately you come to a place that you you just have to do what you believe god wants you to do so it ultimately comes down to unless there's an absolute green light or a red light to your heart has anyone looked at the 2021 gmc sierra duramax pickups did you know that if a man continually looked at them drove by said in drove it he got on his computer he pulled up wallpaper for his screen he got their calendar and hung it in his house had a picture on his phone wouldn't be very long he'd be driving it because that would dominate him and pretty soon his heart would convince him he had to have this you see if we in the flesh the scripture says lust after the flesh the fulfillment of the lust of the flesh will be the culmination of that lust so if our heart desires in the flesh it will ultimately manifest in the flesh and here was balaam known through the region as a prophet but you see had an opportunity to expand the borders of his garment his influence brother branham says that he knew all the right ways to approach god right he knew the proper approach unto god was demonstrating the sacrifice of the clean beast yet he was not a true word prophet for when god spoke his heart spoke louder and it's one thing for your heart to speak loud i tell you my heart speaks loud but oh i tell you it speaks really loud and really confident when god says that's right that's what you can do do this amen then you can stand up and say praise the lord i can i'm moving forward with confidence but you see when he got to this place god says no but his heart was greater he wanted this so bad that he just kept coming back oh lord i i want to go lord i need to go lord i want to be part of that lord i could do some good for you i could i could and god finally says go go go for he's motivated by his lust for golden prestige so god let him go the perfect will of god gave way to the permissible will of god because of the heart desire now saints let me circle this back around to this take your heart's desire what your heart is telling you you need to do want to do desire to do and then run it through the filter of the word and if what you want to do gets filtered out please i ask you in the name of the lord don't keep trying to run it back through the filter amen just accept it might not be god let's use the pickup that i chose for an example it might not be that god doesn't want you to to have a nice pickup but god's got one waiting for you god's got something in the season uh something's gonna come your way something's gonna change it's gonna sit on a lot and sit there forever and ever and ever and ever and one day it turns into a close-out and they knocked tens and thousands of dollars off of the price from what you would have paid for it and it's still there waiting for you i've seen these things happen i've seen god move in this fashion my brother and sister and you look at that and if we will submit our heart amen we can submit flash you know cut our hair dress correct brothers right speak right treat our wives right all of this saying sisters tame you know all this we we can submit our flesh but if we never submit our hearts that's right i'll tell you i i just a little bunt but i'm going to go ahead and say it hey man i had a sister one time just in so many words tell me she never gave her heart to her husband i'm telling you my brother and sister there's a family that's going to have nothing but pain and sorrow they're going to have nothing but troubles and rebellion in their household nothing but friction there's not going to be any kind of leadership in there it's going to be i'm going to do what i'm going to do and you do what you want to do kind of thing my brother and sister we've got to come to the place our hearts desire is to our husband and our husband is jesus christ amen and without that heart's desire to him we'll find ourselves led off into many many different trails and find ourselves in all kinds of trouble and travail hallelujah amen oh you know look at this as we go forward here he comes on he tells them now the perfect will gave way to permissible will because of the heart's desire god actually said go ahead now forgive me for sounding this way but when he went forth and said the lord told me to do this i don't know if you've ever been in a situation where someone says yeah the lord told me to do this saints i want you to be careful now i don't want you to turn into sherlock holmes to see if everybody's got you know the real word from the lord you know we're going to buy a car are you sure now let's just analyze no i'm sorry you don't do that but i also when it comes to spiritual things want you church to be careful about when people say well the lord told me to do this you have a right to inspect the word and especially it's going to influence you oh i'm not turning friend against friend and family against family but don't you just sit back and take somebody's word for it when they say god said it's going to line up and prove that god's head sometimes you know as a preacher i wish i could go into details because some of you guys i'd have to furnish fire extinguishers for you you'd just be like what but have somebody come to you and say the lord told me to do this i learned from a couple brothers that are pastors they've helped me with my impetuous responses just to say the lord told you okay just want to clarify that you see there's no need to argue with them they've made their mind up you don't know how many times they went back to god and said lord i want to do this i want to do this i want to do this until they got to do this but you see when you're standing there and someone says the lord told me to do this and you can think of a half a dozen scriptures that that counter dicks right there god didn't tell them to do that i'm sorry that's why reason preachers sometimes get cynical saints it's because they hear people not just people but you know preachers and whatever else saying well god told us to do this wait it's against the word god told me to do it after a while you're like well i guess you can do anything you can do anything you please but i want to encourage you saints put your heart's desire through the filter of the word and if it won't go through it then just stop right there don't force it through it don't force it through it don't stand on it you remember a colander you know don't stand on top of the colander and pound on that until it goes through it amen praise the lord hallelujah well there's just a lot here and if we don't make it very far here we'll be fine saints mean less studying for next week [Laughter] okay did god change his mind no sir god had his way regardless of balaam going balaam did not annul the will of god god had his way regardless it was balaam who was a loser for he bypassed the word you see ultimately we can cut down all kinds of detail saints when we're looking at this negative side of this you can bypass all kinds of details and all kinds of back story if you just look and see whether or not they're bypassing the word anything that's bypassing the word you bypass it you know because it's just it's headed to trouble of some kind amen you know some something's got to give way sooner or later amen it was balaam who's the loser for he bypassed the word and today we have that very same thing women preachers organizations false doctrines etc people worshiping god manifesting in the spirit and going right on as did balaam claiming that god spoke to them even when the commission received is opposite to the revealed word amen and i will not deny that god spoke to them see this is where it gets complicated church that's where it gets really complicated because there's no denying but i'm sorry whether god said yes or not what was the original word anything contrary to that in original word we've got to just say no no no sorry i can't accept it but this minister was with the prophet the prophet told them this and they wrote it down and that's why we do what we do my brother and sister i'm sorry i will not call anyone a liar i simply refuse to call anyone a liar but that doesn't fit this therefore it's valueless let's be real didn't the prophet of god say i come here to point you back to the word of god amen so we can't you know got the quote where brother branham says the holy ghost will never take you away from the word he always brings you into the word right so he's not going to take us away so recognize these spirits that's why the prophet of god brought it down for you and i my revelation can give everything in life a word test not for me to run out you know to a young man or somebody and say now do you this and this can you tell me where brother brown said this and if you can't quote what quote and when it was you're not a message believer i'm sorry some of us can't hardly remember our phone number i'm glad that my phone number's on the very top of the list in my phone amen so you look at that you guys don't have your own phone number in your phone okay thank you i feel better already so you look at this see claiming that it's spoken and brother brown says and i i don't even deny that god spoke to them but it was just like when he spoke to baylor that second time as he knew what balaam wanted his own hearts desire above the word wouldn't it be much simpler if god just give us a little litmus test like as in i open the bottle lick the strip but what it would do it would just circumvent the word right because the word says it's got to all stay into the harvest you imagine i've done this saints i hope you don't mind me just this liberty i've done this try to get the weed out of the field before before the harvest you know what you end up having to do you end up having to put your boots around the base of the weed and pulling to try and pull the weed out without ripping out the wheat and did you know it's virtually impossible because that weed's roots have went out and i'm just saying this figuratively okay nobody get upset and they went to your house and they went to your house went to your house your house right they went out they're feeding on the same and you just can't rip it out without affecting everything around it he wanted his own heart's desire by the word and he gave it to him now tell me my god's not good that's right my god so good you want it more than the word i'll even just go ahead and give you what you want more than the word yeah scary but yet all the while in the end having his own way even so today god tells folks to go ahead in their own hearts desire for they have already rejected the word my brother and sister this might come across a little strong forgive me but when people come trying to reinvent this message to you i want you to read the resume of the ages again we don't need the message reinvented to us we need god to fully reveal it to our heart amen not our mind you know i got on one of those things you know it was in a foyer of a building one time put my 50 cents in there you stand on the deal you put two fingers on the thing and you speak answers into a speaker and it tells you what your iq is and i did that and it said my iq is like 147. and i thought well that's not bad i got off i put another 50 cents in there climbed back on and did it again and it said i had iq of like 83. so if we take too much outside input i walk away there being very smart or walk away from their dumb as dirt all because what something else said or someone else said or someone else's preaching said that's why it's got to be a personal revelation that i got in the word and the word was in christ and i said lord whatever you want i want isn't that just as easy as saying lord give me what i want is to say lord give me what you want amen and to step into that and when god comes back and says you're my son you're my daughter just keep on believing keep on pressing amen hold on to the end and then we've got something to stand on because he's not going to come back and tell you you put your next 50 cents you know i think i'll put it more like this you put somebody else's two cents in there it's not going to come back and say you're a loser it's going to come back and tell your son or daughter of god every single time hallelujah amen can i have just a few short more minutes you see when we look at this i want to just reiterate here remember brother brown says balaam held a prophetic office so it's not even that the prophetic is taking place around you because things can be prophesied and come to pass and not lead us to christ hallelujah yes yes my oh my but the will of god will be done regardless see this doesn't depress me this doesn't you know make me feel bummed out you know we're talking about balaam and all these bad things but the will of god will be done regardless that means amen that when one turns their heart sorry brother christian to to go this way for just a moment but when one starts to turn their heart and says you know i'm i might go ahead and see about jesus christ amen you see what we're looking at is not our ideas or any other man's ideas or the disappointments of life we're looking at god's will being done regardless regardless of the environment one is raised in the kind of friends one was raised when whatever all this stuff regardless of that there was a church next door and that's how i come to the lord that's beautiful but some amen i remember down chaloy island young lady down there gives her heart to the lord she lived in the middle of nowhere but she come to get a dress made for a wedding i think it was wasn't it and the dressmaker was a believer so this little girl travels this just incredible distance to get a dress made and the dressmaker is a believer and the sister admitted right in front of the young lady after she gave her heart to the lord she said i i never sewed a dress so slow in my life and she's just talking to this young lady the young lady expressed this story how my life feels empty i just you know i don't i don't know it just doesn't seem like there's much she starts talking to her you see my brother and sister it don't matter you can live in a rural route nowhere that's right god will come because his will will be done regardless i hope you see this it will not only clear up much of what is seen in all the ages but it will especially help in this last age which has so much manifestation and external blessing when the whole period is so against the word revealed will of god if an age ever received a message loud and clear this age did it was and is that old testament truth the son of the bond woman will distress the son of the free woman until the son of the bondwoman be cast out we're seeing it happen saints it's coming to pass right before our eyes that lets us know that the hatred and the blasphemy of satan against the true christian will be vented through a group who is who are nominal false christians and this will increase until god uproots that false vine at the end of the laodicean age feel any pressure i don't know about you guys but some days my days are so pressurized i feel like my head's going to blow off poor sister jerry pray for her figuratively i gnaw on her right and left i come home i'm so uptight she bears the brunt why maybe it's a phone call maybe it's a little something here maybe it's something that you know about and you just are in travail over these things some of it's just the cares of life but we're living in a pressurized age amen and we don't have to blow up under this pressure because we've got a place to let it off and that beautiful got a lovely place to let off the pressure hallelujah and so it's going to increase let me just let me just you know knock the smile off your face trials ain't going away the troubles ain't going away the struggle ain't going away but your faith is increasing hallelujah and you say well i i do we have rapturing faith i'm here to tell you this morning i have rapturing faith amen i'm gonna take the position the apostle paul had and i'm here to tell you rapturing faith is boiling out of the bride of jesus christ but she's not living to her potential to put it to work yet so god's bringing rapturing faith and us right together and when that day is necessary you imagine if god just said okay here's all the faith right here and right before your eyes to take a rapture right now most of you would be ripping the wrappings off of that thing and god be saying wait whoa stop no i'm out of here we wouldn't be hanging out here but you see it's got to come to the season when the terror has to be tore up we're getting close we're getting close amen god's fixing to uproot them you know there's some really cool really cool quotes you know talking about the times and the seasons and and uh disrupting of those things uh brother branham uses the word uh oh not just pandemic it had had something on the back of it oh i don't remember brother barry coffey just shared that quote uh i thought wow that is incredible because he's talking uses the root word pandemic but it's some you know addition to it coming right into those times yep that's the times we're coming in right into those times of the pandemic yeah right into the time when everything seems to be chaos amen i'm sorry i can't i thought i could remember those words but the third age revealed by the spirit of prophecy that the worldly church would adopt nicolaitis as a doctrine a separation of the clergy from the laity grew from the biblical truth of the elder shepherds of local flocks ruling the flock by the word that's so old-fashioned really leading the church by the bible i mean that has to be like a first century thing the genesis thing yeah rooting the flock by the word to the deeds of the nicolaitan see here's some more of these deeds that they're going to be judged by because one of the deeds my brother and sister now i tell you this actually makes me kind of a little nervous because one of the deeds i would be judged by is the deed of how i led this church i said i'm a message pastor i said i'm a believer i get judged by those words i'll get judged by the deed of how i lead the church my you know what i think i'm going to do this right not so much for your sake as for my own but wait if i can make a rapture you can make rapture and worry feeding on the same thing i'm safe amen i'm going to be all right wherein the clergy set themselves in ranks one over the other which unscriptural formula then evolved into a priesthood that placed the courage of clergy between man and god given the clergy certain rights all the while denying the laity their god-given rights that was a serpent or however you say that in this age it become a doctrine it was established in the church as the assured word of god which indeed it was not look i i'm just i feel like tearing a little rubber on the road in the last year year and a half in several situations i've had people tell me brother branham said this i have searched the message up down around sideways at an angle from far away from close and found either the complete opposite or not at all that's right and men by email text whatever tell you this is what the prophet said really i'm sure glad they made more than one ego computing program you see we're not exempt from this spirit of saying no no now this is the word no i'm sorry i've got the word i've got the word the prophet came to me too prophet came to you too we've got the word amen that's why we have to have a personal time of digging into the word of god don't trust brother paul trust me please but don't trust me that's right what do they say that um trust but verify that's that's what i mean trust but verify don't hang your soul as it would be over hell on some man's words of his interpretation of the message amen it was established in the church as the assured word of god now some of these things that people have sent me by brother and sister and said well brother brown said this and this and you can't find it or he says exactly the opposite what if we held that as the assured word we would be believing something that's not even in the word of god not even in the message of the hour see this is how close these spirits are coming they're coming in and they are bold enough to declare this is the message it might be your message but it's not our message because our message lines up with the word of god but the clergy called it the word of god and therefore doctrine was antichrist now that's pretty harsh isn't it brother paul can be pretty harsh because he actually believes this when people come and start pitching stuff in the middle of my carcass are you with me they're pitching stuff in the middle of my carcass that i'm feeding on and saying this is the message and then when brother paul says no it ain't they get very harsh on me but i don't think i'm quite as harsh as brother branham is right there because he says they're doctrines antichrist you know i'm just going to kind of skip forward saints there is just there's that and then there's that and then there's that we'll stop right here sister amy would you come musicians please don't read just a little bit look i'm telling you saints preaching about the negative side of things is necessary i believe right we need to mark where we stand so that someone doesn't keep moving the boundaries that's why surveyors amen they have a job a never-ending job is to complete or continue to mark the boundaries but preaching about that ain't no fun so i wanted to close the service out today on this quote right here because this is what i really get excited about this is what i really like you say well if i get baptized the holy ghost then well maybe the lord will take me meaning like i get baptized i'd be ready to go to heaven is god going to kill me no not only that you're just getting ready to live oh think about this saints amen you get you get baptized get the holy ghost then well maybe the lord will take me no not on that you're just getting ready to live you ain't ready to live till you got the holy you get the holy ghost and then when you get the holy ghost then you're just fit to live he wasn't fit to live before that but now you're just fit to live after you've got the holy ghost see just getting you ready see people say well i i gotta get ready to die oh my i'm getting ready to live hallelujah not getting ready to die i'm getting ready to live amen there's nothing more so in me i i figured out saints uh i may be a little transparent here but i figured out one of the things about little paul here as a boy little paul never wanted to go to bed at night got a lot of psychological things of why kids don't want to go to bed at night maybe they believe there's monsters under their bed maybe they don't like their room because the tree branch scratches on the eve [Music] or maybe they're afraid to die as long as i'm awake i'm all right as a little kid i struggled with that i don't know why either grandma grandpa a few people passed away but that's normal you know what i mean nothing different than you experienced i just never wanted to go to bed sister jerry still lives with the after effect of that it's become a habit when i pass out in the chair it's bedtime till then i've got something to do but look at this people say well i've got to get ready to die oh my i'm just getting ready to live amen the thing it is get ready to live live in christ this getting right down here is what i loved on this victorious life over sin over death right because i'm going to read this as the english language it would actually place it a victorious life over sin victorious life over death victorious life over hell right amen i already have the victory he's my victory and i'm his evidence hallelujah you want to know if christ has got the victory look around there'll be evidence you know for years i've made that statement that i believe that the vindication of brother branham's ministry did not take place it did in a sense saying i'm not trying to backtrack against that but i believe the vindication of brother branham's ministry is sitting in this church this morning hallelujah because the word he preached is producing a bride that is living the very word he preached amen so if it produced nothing then his ministry in essence would have been nothing but he preached the word and the supernatural come and in laodicea where the demons are hanging off the rafters they're still a bride that's an overcomer she's the one that's there and she recognizes i've got victory because he's my victory he already had the victory so i've got victory and wait if there's victory and i'm part of this then i'm the evidence oh hallelujah makes my heart just rejoice i'm the evidence i got the part well i'm not a preacher i'm not this i'm not that oh but your evidence and when the trial comes the evidence is always introduced amen so you'll be there but you won't be there as the judge you'll be there as the evidence of the overcoming life the overcoming holy ghost-filled powerful life hallelujah who wants to raise the bar this morning let's just go ahead and click her up another level hallelujah amen i already have the victory my we might be as presumptuous as the apostle paul saints amen the words that he spoke i won't speak anything to you but what god already proved through me whoa that's presumptuous paul is it well i'll tell you what i'm already the victory and i'm already the evidence that the victory works amen he's my victory i'm his evidence i'm an evidence of his victory amen that's it well hallelujah hallelujah oh yes praise the lord hallelujah oh my saints let's just stand and worship the lord for a few minutes before we go i hope me getting all excited isn't the problem [Music] oh hallelujah yeah hallelujah hard to get excited when you're talking about lukewarm and cold spirits and people twisting the word and all that hard to get excited about that and saints quite honestly i just want to just move on from all these things and talk about the bride and her beauty and and what god's got in store for her and what he's already done amen the evidence hallelujah that he's present is already in our midst we're not sitting there waiting for uh oh what do they call that in a trial for for the you know presenting of the evidence amen uh i can't think of the word but you know we're not waiting for that to happen it's already done it's already done hallelujah how great are you lord isn't he great this morning saints let's just worship the lord for just a few minutes hallelujah how great are you lord oh
