Lord father it is your Victory Lord that gives us our security it is your life Lord that is changing our lives father Lord it is everything that you said you would be we are now becoming if we say thank you Lord for father without you we truly would be nothing but Lord with you we can't do all things we are conquerors amen and we are able to press to the mark of the high calling and we enter the Bible with confidence and I say thank you tonight bless our time together Lord bless your word Lord just the Saints father those that are not here tonight be with him Lord speak to hearts Lord Jesus father we thank you for your grace and your mercy open your word to us tonight I pray hallelujah thank you Lord Jesus amen is it not good to be in the house of the Lord tonight amen I tell you I ran a lot of laps this week so far and now here I'm coming in for a little pit stop getting refueled refreshed amen invigorated by the word of God we can move right out finish the week oh it's not on my ear you know that isn't it a special ingredient right there can we edit amen amen isn't it wonderful though we get to come in the middle of the week and God just comes and strengthen us gives us a little encouragement does that mean if we weren't here tonight that we would just fall apart absolutely not but it is a necessary thing just to keep refreshed amen It just strikes me as I look in the word how this almost David speak so strongly and says you know what restored to me that means he already had it but restored to me the joy of my salvation amen which means if we're not careful our joy can slip away from us but I tell you I'm here tonight not only to be invigorated in my spirit but just have my joy refilled amen God bless you tonight I want to speak to you kind of along the same lines as last week but the promised generation as we look in the word these scriptures thank you for the musicians as thank you very much we look in the scripture you know and and we realize there is a chosen generation as it speaks uh my brother and sister but I want to take that and put it to you in this context there was a promised generation that God said I will fulfill the last or the final acts of my word and it will be in that generation that I've chosen to go ahead and open up the whole sure amen so it's there that we come and I want to take as a little subtitle or whatever their Rejoice for your name is in the book amen let's turn in the Book of Romans the fourth chapter uh just uh a couple of different passages of scripture out of Romans tonight amen Romans the fourth chapter verses one through nine amen just to give you a little heads up while you're turning our our uh go brain dead pole yes um are brother from Florida my brother Stan price um our brother Stan price um and his wife will be arriving this next Tuesday and um uh we look forward they're going to have a little time here in the west uh traveling around just a little bit and so I just pray that they would have a lovely time a little time of rest even though they will be speaking uh a few different places and uh are also arriving uh this coming Tuesday night will be our brother Vitale and his family from Lithuania just asked that you would lift them up in prayer also Romans the fourth chapter what shall we say then that Abraham our father as pertaining to the flesh have found for If Abraham were justified by works he hath whereof to Glory but not before God that's where all of our works comes down we can glory in that but not before God for what saith the scripture Abraham believed God and it was counted unto him for righteousness now to him that worketh is the reward not reckoned of Grace but of debt but to him that worketh not but believeth on him that justifieth the ungodly his faith is counted for righteousness even as David also describeth the blessedness of the man and to whom God imputeth righteousness without works saying blessed are they whose iniquities are forgiven whose sins are covered blessed is the man in whom the Lord will not impute sin cometh this blessedness then upon the circumcision only or upon the uncircumcision also for we say that Faith was reckoned to Abraham for righteousness Heavenly Father we ask for your blessings on the service tonight in your precious name amen you may be seated we wouldn't mind just lifting a little prayer I had to go out and find out why some water wasn't traveling where it was supposed to in the middle of a corn field and I've been all stuffed up and kind of choked up since then uh just a simple case of allergies but it has definitely uh been tough on me amen as we look at this I want to just bring out a couple points here before we move on we look at this my brother and sister and if we're not careful we will approach God like it is a death that we must pay now let's look real careful at this that we realize that we as a song says had a debt we could not pay but God wants us to accept this gift from him and not feel like we're a debtor you know my brother and sister in the natural sometimes if someone gives us a nice gift we kind of feel like we really owe them a nice gift in return but truly a gift my brother and sister is something that is given freely from the heart with nothing in expectation for return and so sometimes we just need to stop and say you know what I receive this gift as a gift unworthy to receive it and not you know any explanation behind it other than someone loved you enough to give you a gift and I say thank you Lord because we don't want to come to the place here that we are serving God trying to pay off a debt amen and so it's there that we just want to trust God but you see my brother and sister if we are going to work off the debt we're going to need to live a whole lot longer amen like you would have to live for eternity just to work the dead off so it's not something that we in our flesh can do but by the grace of God a free will gift that God said I am going to give to you and in this gift is going to be everything you need to fulfill what I desire of you amen now we can look at this and say well the Christian's going to do this this and this but remember God wrote this on the fleshly table of the heart with not an expectation of you checking the Box off but an expectation of what was written on your heart affecting you so strongly that you have a heart's desire to fulfill the word of God for we know that as it is in the the Old Testament that works will not satisfy the law amen because we are unable but when one from his heart is able to come and Free Will and my brother and sister we never want to be grudging I remember a little thing from my childhood about how that uh you know I had been given a gift at one time uh by a cousin and then when the birthday party or evening was over he took the gift home with him and so you know it was uh is a little awkward right because I liked the gift I thought it was my gift but he he just later explained to his parents no I only gave it to him to play with for a little while and so my brother and sister if we was to apply such human principles we would think that God had only given us this measure of Grace and a measure of faith for just a little while but God has given it to us for as long as we will need it amen and so we are there my brother and sister just turning to Romans the 9th chapter verses one through eight just kind of to carry this thought along uh it says if I say the truth in Christ I lie not my conscience also bearing me witness in the Holy Ghost put himself to a very high standard of accountability that I have great heaviness and continual sorrow in my heart for I could wish that myself were accursed from Christ for my brethren my Kinsmen according to the flesh who are Israelites to whom pertaineth the adoption and the glory and the covenants and the giving of the law and the service of God and the promises who are the fathers and of whom concerning the flesh Christ came who is overall God blessed forever amen not as though the word of God hath taken none effect for they are not all is Israel which are of Israel neither because they are the Seed of Abraham are they all children but in Isaac shall thy seed be called that is here is the explanation that is they which are the children of the flesh these are not the children of God but the children of the promise are counted for the seed amen I say God bless the word amen as we look at this and we realize that this Covenant that was given now people say I don't kind of understand how the switch come from being the Seed of Abraham to Sons and Daughters of God and this is why we are speaking on this tonight because you see my brother and sister very clearly is it uh articulated here in Romans specifically this eighth verse that the children of the flesh or the children of the flesh but my brother and sister when you are a child of the promise when God makes a promise God keeps a promise amen and I say thank you for that tonight now as we look we'll see here in these verse verses that he's declaring to the Romans that with great heaviness and sorrow in his heart that he himself if he could would be cursed that they might be able to receive of this promise but you see my brother and sister God's plan is so perfect in detail and his plan is so perfect in continuity that it is there that you cannot bring a substitute now remember the lamb was in a Essence a substitute for a representation that the blood covering this sin but not abolishing or doing away with the sin and so it's there that we realize that God allowed the blood of a lamb turtle dove Etc to cover their sin but God says you know what I'm going to do I'm going to have a people and I'm making a covenant with them that I'm going to come and I'm going to completely as it were annihilate Sin from their life and you say but brother Paul we still make mistakes when someone say Amen to that but you see it's not what we are doing but what God is doing or you might say in a different sense what God hath already done amen I'm telling you my brother and sister if we could recognize the power of the words there in Golgotha and Calvary when he said it is finished amen and that was a final punctuation that leaves nothing else to be added and nothing to be carried on or substituted for so now we are no longer taking the blood of bulls and goats as a substitute to cover sin but our sin has been completely annihilated amen the devil would like to tell us that he still has an account somewhere but my brother and sister his account as you would listen or read the trial you'll see that the devil's account will not hold up in court oh thank you Lord they can bring all that evidence they want and say but they did this just covered can't find it been acquitted been pardoned whatever Satan would like to bring it but my brother and sister God said it's finished it's finished and so we see now in this my brother and sister the children of the flesh you go to Israel today and uh they will give you very stiff there's actually quite a a anti-christian's sentiment rising up there is I just watched a deal the other day we're a group now I'm going to sound judgmental but they didn't really look like Christians in the way we would approach it uh people going to have service and seeing dressed like they had just come you know from the beach or wherever but here are these Orthodox Jews blocking them from entering in to the place where they were going chanting and talking and pushing and shoving and yelling in their faces intimidating and there's a a spirit there that is rising up or pushing back on that but my brother and sister we have to recognize not all that is Israel is Israel amen so they're Anointed with religious Spirits just like uh people in America are anointed with religious Spirits all over the world Amen and I would say as we read this that truly our hearts ache or should ache for the world around us my brother and sister you go and and you can go into a store or uh some place and you'll meet this the most lovely people and yet you see how Satan has put a mark on them already amen and it's there that they're wonderful people truly but it is that my brother and sister they need the true Gospel of Jesus Christ they have the gospel but they need the true gospel in other words they need the book opened and this is why the significance my brother and sister of the open book is so important to us it's not a cliche that we speak from that the book is open but my brother and sister it is a reality that we're living in today that the book must be open and we have many people sitting on pews in message churches that the book is still closed and we should not look down on them we should be praying for them Lord open our eyes and our ears and our hearts because my brother and sister we never gave ourself the gift of revelation we never gave ourselves an opening to the view of the word of God Amen but it's God alone doing the work and we should do all we can do I don't care you know God's dealing with me has been for quite a while and just softening to this to me that regardless of what position people are in we'll take the prophet for an example you didn't know who his enemies were because he treated people kindly now some people have an idea that brother Branham never ever addressed the the things that were twisted or shifted or what but that's not true my brother and sister he didn't give them a pass and because he's going to love them so much but he worked and dealt and encouraged with respect amen and that's what we should have whether it's a little clerk in a grocery store in a gas station a Quick Mart or whatever we should deal with people in respect amen because you see regardless of what some people would think today you cannot educate the revealed word into someone you cannot my brother and sister explain these things we have dealt with this before my brother and sister you can't explain the opening of the seventh seal but yet it's right there all through this scripture just uh it's it's there it's already been there God didn't have to run back now and add a chapter or add a line or a verse or whatever to give an explanation or what of the opening of the seventh seal but quite clearly it just became God all through the Bible revealed in this hour in the final age right now look my brother and sister we can take this I'll get a little ahead of myself you can take this chosen generation but you know the word chosen and selected is the same definition and so it is there that we are a selected generation sometimes that might change our perspective to realize God chose this last day and we are the selected generation a selected people it is not random it wasn't just because we come out of a certain family line because there's many a Believers the only one in their whole family that is a Believer so it didn't have to be in a Heritage but God said you know what I'm choosing a people and I'm choosing a time and a place for the opening of the word now when God opened the word my brother and sister he didn't come and bring a manual for it no because he'd already published the manual the Manual's already been published we just had to come to a revelation to understand like the tent Vision my brother and sister is repeated over and over again in the Bible the tent vision is not a 20th century Revelation but God revealing himself in not form and fashion goes all the way back and so when people say well if God is present with us there was a quote sister Jerry sent me today and I was going to include it and I didn't amen but you know what if we're there and we're looking back and we have expectation to see God you will see God all the way through the Bible in continuity amen he didn't come and then shift his Direction amen does that mean that he couldn't come and add something to it yes because that was already in the word veiled so God then unveils it for our generation like my brother and sister for you and I to catch a revelation that this message in this day a is not for another eighth Church age a ninth Church age or a tenth Church age but to wrap it all up and fulfill it in this church age amen which is carrying on out people would say well but time is going but remember it's the scoffers that say nothing's changed well I'll tell you my brother and sister something has changed this bride of Christ coming into maturity is now able to take now follow my little analogy she's able to take the grain of the word and to grind it and it's not a seed life any longer but it's the nourishment that came out of the word into the Bride of this day and so we can say but where where's the seed that will be planted my brother and sister there'll come a day that we don't need to plant as it were that seed any longer now you want to know the life that's in the seed I was going to look the article up so I could document it to you but many years ago some archaeologists there in Egypt happen to in one of those tombs uncover a dish a bowl a whatever you would call it that had wheat seed in it and so they took a certain little portion of that and put it into the perfect environment in a lab to see if the wheat after had to be just a a phenomenal amount of time whether that wheat would grow and it grew but my brother and sister they were shocked they had some idea mental conception that the wheat was some little puny thing because we as men have done such a great job of cross-breeding and bringing forth to have this great wheat that we have now but they planted that wheat and they were shocked at the wheat it produced and I want to tell you why they were shocked because that wheat seed was a lot closer to the original than we are amen and so it wasn't deluded down with man ideas and everything through the age and we ought to cross it with this and we ought to cross it with that and that's why that original word Unearthed are you with me that original word unearth is producing a bride because it is close to the original amen it hasn't been hybrid by man and by religious spirits but it's close to the original and it will bring forth and it's shocking in fact it's so shocking they're not sure they want to accept it the idea that people could come I just listened to a deal the other day and they were actually mocking this certain uh group and they were saying you know their whole little doctrine that they would be as little gods and I'm like do they not read their Bible do they not understand what they read because the word is telling us that we are as Gods little Gods minder as you would my brother and sister but nonetheless we have the very DNA of the king in US amen and that is producing a life to a people that are able to take the grain of the word and take it in and it produces life but we're not taken out and burying it for another generation we're letting it produce a life in you and I and that life has to be ingested to be digested amen you cannot just draw the life out of the grain or the word as it were without ingesting it amen take the book and eat take the book and eat amen hallelujah how important that is take the book and eat amen Hallelujah now as we'll look right here in the seven Church ages this is quite a lengthy quote so bear with me if you would please the possibility of the removal of a name from the records of God deserves more than a casual study for up until now most students have merely drawn a conclusion that God places the names of those Born Again within the Lamb's Book of Life at the time of their rebirth and if for any reason that name must be removed the space on the record will simply be a blank as it was before a name had been placed there this is 100 percent opposite to what the word actually teaches at the very start of our study let it be known that there is not one scripture that teaches that God is presently compiling a record of names my you know sometimes we just kind of fall into what we've been taught and oh they got saved somebody's wrote their name in the book my brother and sister it was in the book amen I'm glad the names are in the book amen because the devil sure wants to get it out amen and the devil would sure like the PIN to run out of ink the pencil led to break or whatever it might be to keep a name from being there but there's nothing can you hear me there's nothing the devil can do about your name in the book hmm now it seems contradictory when we go on here but my brother and sister are son or daughter of God has a desire to serve God there's not one thing the devil can do at the very start of our study let it be no there's not one scripture that teaches that God is presently compiling a record of names this was all done before the foundation of the world as we will point out shortly also is not a question of Simply involving ourselves with two groups of people both of whom had opportunity to receive eternal life wherein one group received it and had their names placed on record while the others who refused did not have their names uh so placed we will actually show how by so by scripture that multitudes this don't let this one throw you some of you are reading ahead here you know that just I just I just can't spring it on you if you've already read it amen but look at this look at this it'll show another group there's a group of people whose names have been placed on that record before the foundation of the world uh cannot under any circumstance have those names removed amen uh oh I I jumped the line excuse me we will actually show by scripture that multitudes were not even born again will go into eternal life as strange as this may sound it is certainly true amen well wouldn't that be just easier not to have to labor and we just as some people have this idea we'll just stand outside a message Church handing out glasses of water you see it's deeper than what some people want to place it out oh I was here at this place and this person did this for me that will be their glass of water I'm not here to judge but I could if it's lawful give your opinion I think it's a little deeper than somebody holding the door for you at Walmart hmm you see God knows what you need when you need it and God will use individuals to fulfill needs in your life and you'll say why did they do that they're not even a Christian they're not even this not even that maybe heaven forbid that they're tattooed up and not dressed properly and yet from their heart they do something for you or your family and God says that is what I'm talking about my brother and sister I won't say that holding the door is not sufficient it's not for me to decide we don't need to go running around putting people in and out we need to just settle down and say Lord let my light shine let it be that Who I Am Lord that that would be there and you know we have seen personally experienced times when people had Unknown People to you had such animosity toward you that it's stunning you're like I don't even know these people why see there's that spiritual warfare going on and when someone would say you know what I'm going to side with this person God's saying you're an ally and then you've got these people that just hate you without even knowing you and they're identifying themselves and we have to recognize my brother and sister God's the only one that has it all in control amen the rest of us well sometimes we'll still be figuring it out right brother Branham said God doesn't reveal Everything To His prophets so even the prophet dealt with some of these experiences my brother and sister without fully understanding what was happening you say do you have proof of that no only taking his own words only proof I have is his own words so you see the spirit Warfare going on Amen so these not even born again will go into eternal life and we will also show that there is a group of people whose names having been placed on that record before the foundation of the world cannot under any circumstance have those names removed Can someone say thank you Lord amen chosen of God Amen a generation a chosen people that no matter how many times we might stumble and what the struggles of our life will be God says I wrote your name in that book and you will not be removed because you are my elect lady you are my bride and I have chosen you and we would look here and say Lord I failed you so many times How Could You Love Me Lord how could you forgive me Lord how could it be and God says it's finished hmm I say thank you Lord amen because otherwise the devil would be right there with a whole box full of erasers saying here I got a new racer I got a new racer I'll loan you an eraser but God says I'm not erasing their name they're my bride I chose them I've got them written in the book and I wrote them in my own blood so it's not something that is going to be erased hmm well look at this my brother and sister but we'll also show that another group whose names were on that record before the foundation of the world will have their names removed wait now we're in a limbo one side here there's names on the record that absolute can't be removed at all and there's names over here that can be now we all live in a world of free moral agency we decide to come to church or not I don't know did anybody come around your house with a school bus tonight and force you to get on and come to church did any of you receive any threatening calls if you're not in church tonight no desert at the next Fellowship no free moral agency and God recognizes that there'll be those that come to a crossroad and they have to make a decision they come to that place you say brother Paul what do you have to back it up what does the prophet have to back it up Rich Young Ruler Judas although Judas was already as this scripture says kind of uh to already directed going to his own but we'll see that he come down there he had a true Holy Ghost Ministry it wasn't fraudulent it was real people were delivered under that imagine this shock my brother and sister when those that Judas had prayed for when they saw him fall they said we saw the power of God the prayers delivered demons from us were cast out we heard the word open and it was real and it was effective what happened but look at the Rich Young Ruler stands right there not as it were let me use I don't know what word to use here but not to a servant right not to one of the Apostles or one of the disciples but here's a Rich Young Ruler talking to Jesus himself and basically explaining to him that I would follow you but oh Lord help us to eliminate the butts out of our I was too tired I worked too hard on Wednesdays and I'm too tired to come to church now that might sound pointed but I want it to be pointed because it's decisions my brother and sister it's decisions that we make and little seeds grow into big plants amen and it's there that as it is I'm telling you I get to witness all of these kind of things manifested week after week been walking through corn fields just looking at pollination and maturities and my brother and sister you'll see that and they're spots that this corn is thin and the sunlight has penetrated all the way to the earth and the weeds are five and six feet tall but you go over just a couple steps where the corn is thick and there's a plant everywhere there should be a plant and the weeds that did Germany are these little sickly things because they're not in the light amen and so you see how this is coming that day is an opportunity for people and some are going to have their names removed brother Branham says right to begin with there is no basis for the claims that the Lamb's Book of Life is not the same as the Book of Life The Book of Life might be called the Lamb's Book of Life or Christ's Book of Life or even thy book and book of the living only names are written in it amen my brother and sister he says right here Revelation 13 8 and all dwell upon the Earth shall worship Him the Beast whose names are not written in the Book of Life of the lamb slain from the foundation of the world so you look there and realize that people will think well maybe I can just I could just be a good person my brother and sister those people whose names are not in that book are going to be deceived it's that simple amen now how they get to that place is subject to another sermon and and whatever but you come to that place my brother and sister we better be saying Thank You Lord that our name is written in the book Amen to Rejoice that our name is written in the book uh Revelation 17 8. the Beast that thou Sauced was and is not and shall Ascend out of the bottomless pit and go into Perdition and they that dwell on the Earth shall wonder whose names were not written in the Book of Life from the foundation of the world when they behold the Beast that was and is not and yet is now look at this my brother and sister why is the bride not going to be deceived what did the prophet of God say because she is the word amen that will be the only thing that keeps you and I from being deceived is that we are the word and we have been documented amen nothing like being documented have you ever been to an occasion where literally there at the door and you don't get into this event unless your name is on that list amen and you walk up there and is able to say uh this is Mr and Mrs Paul heylet and they go down the list and it's there yes you are and they tell you now this gentleman right here will seat you and then you go and you have your place to be seated and someone else a misunderstanding they have the invitation in their hand but their name's not in the book that's right John 3 16 we want to quote it we want to stand on it we want to hold on that oh John 3 16 John 3 16 but my brother and sister you don't get in unless your name's in the book amen they might say well we don't know about that part over there we don't take care of that but what we do know is you don't get in here without your name in this book amen that happens in the natural amen so you look at how God is working and he's bringing this in the natural and spiritual coming together amen Revelations 20 12-15 and I saw the dead small and great stand before God and the books were open and another book was open isn't that something there's a record here my brother and sister that's not a common everyday record it's not just laying around kind of record but it's the other book amen that'd make a good sermon title Brother David brother Chris the other book amen you might have your name in a book my brother and sister but we want our name in the other book amen that book of life that is there to record this and another book amen which one is the Book of Life and the dead were judged out of those things which were written in the books according to their works now I'm just going to step out here just a little bit my brother and sister some of these books that they're talking about in scripture is literally the written history of our life it is a very book that has recorded every deed word and thought and I say Lord forgive us because sometimes we have Angry thoughts and sometimes our Deeds are not the best of deeds and it's there but that's all done but I'm telling you my brother and sister that words it is finished took the blood of Jesus Christ and blanked the pages of the book of your life of my life I I say thank you Lord amen because my my book would look like one that would not be even a candidate for salvation but when you open that book and there's no record of thoughts words and deeds but there is a name written in another book and I say thank you Lord Jesus how that is my brother and sister are the very foundational fundamentals of being a Christian let's not get away from the foundation and the fundamentals we can talk about doctrines and Revelations and openings and thunderings and vials and all this stuff and if our name is not in that book it won't do us a bit of good you say well isn't that fixed brother Paul well depends on where you're coming from because I'll take the point of view that it's fixed I don't believe you and I are in a position to have our name taken from the book it's not who God called us to be Judas had become a disgruntled Christian Judah said come to the point that he thought Jude Jesus should run his ministry Judas way shouldn't the church run like this shouldn't this happen shouldn't that happen or shouldn't the word be spoken like this and judas's point of view was shouldn't we just rise up and Conquer these people but that wasn't God's way because God said I've already conquered him they're already conquered but Judas didn't have that Vision to see the plan of God many in that day study the history many in that day thought that there was going to be a great Army rise up and expel them from their country from their land but never happened why because God said you know what I promise this land to you but you will not stand you won't hold to the word you compromise again and again and again and the Very spirit that took them to Katie sparnia Was the Same Spirit that took them to bail pior which took them Beyond again and again told them don't marry of the people of the land they went and married them everything became a compromise they could not stand firm and you know in the day that we live in I hope I don't sound too strident tonight but the day that we live in my brother and sister we're facing the greatest day of compromise that has ever come to the Gospel of Jesus Christ and Satan is pressing the compromise because there's no other age to carry on he knows this is going to be the final battle and people say but what about Armageddon my brother and sister Armageddon has nothing to do with you and I amen if we're here for Armageddon we've missed the bus Satan knows he's got to derail our faith train before we get to the End Amen and he's working hard to do that so these books right they were judged out of what was written in the books according to their works and we already touched in Romans 4 of The Works we realize if we're doing it by works we're in debt so really what this book is if I could just simplify it to you tonight this book was the debtors book anybody wants your name in the debtors book I don't my sins have been paid for the blood has covered every last one of them I don't need my name to be recorded in a debtors book aren't you glad to you think about this my children should be especially happy that we're no longer held to pay the debts of our fathers do you realize the significance of that because if we were obligated to pay the debts of our fathers we can go right back to our lineage and realize how big that debt would be family lines that have drunks and womenizers and thieves and liars and extortionists and we would have to pay that debt impossible but we don't have to hmm Hallelujah and this is the second death and whosoever is not found written in the book of lives is cast into the Lake of Fire you can see that though that there are other books mentioned there is always the reference to one book containing names in Revelation it's called the Lamb's Book of Life or The Book of Life Now where is this book located Luke 10 17-24 and the 70 returned again with Joyce saying Lord even the devils are subject unto us through and I would if I have it I have it right here in my notes highlighted amen it is there even the devils are subject to us through thy name amen there is where it's contained right there in the name the name that the word basically prophesied or predicted would come a time that it would be used in vain more than it's used in Praise and as they use it in vain they Heap judgment on themselves and you and I when we speak in reverence and sincerity from our heart the name of Jesus Christ it says when we draw nigh to him he draws nigh unto us and we can call him right down into every situation that we face in our life by just calling on the name of Jesus Christ amen and so you look at this now look they are saying Lord even the Devils imagine this is almost sorry for just bringing this out like this but these are a bunch of guys high five in each other and you know fist bumping and shoulder bumping you know what the devils are even subject to us praise God and Jesus turns around and says unto them I beheld him falling as lightning from the heaven oh we're just pushing his little Junior Partners around here and we think we've done something and Jesus said I was there and saw him fall from the heavens I wonder my brother and sister did they really catch a revelation what he was saying to them you'd have to wonder if they really realized what he was speaking to them that he's telling them I have saw this from the beginning all the way to the end and I saw the day would come when you would cast out devils and he says I give you the power to tread on serpents and scorpions and power over the enemy nothing shall be any means hurt you not withstanding in this Rejoice not now we'll stop right there for a moment my brother and sister there's not one thing right here in these words as the prophet's bringing this out that we should not be claiming we should be claiming the power to tread on serpents and scorpions and over the power of the enemy that nothing by any means should not be subject or would hurt us my brother and sister we should claim that we shouldn't shy from that we shouldn't back up we should be saying this is a promise of the word I claim that Lord but I'm not going to boast in that I'm not going to comment and say I did this and I did that but to come and say by the power of almighty God the gift that he gave us has given this ability ability but then he tells them hey you know what what you should do is stop for a moment don't rejoice in that but amen that the spirits are subject to you that's not really our rejoicing my brother and sister I've been there before sister Jerry's been in the audience of these things in South America and see God come Supernatural homosexual spirits and other things like this people caught up in all kinds of nonsense see God come and deliver them but even in that place right there my brother and sister is no place for us to boast but our boasting as it were should come amen that we are going to Rejoice because we can find our name in the book amen because I tell you many of those people and in this case I can tell you some of those that we saw find Deliverance went for years delivered and at this present moment have fallen back into that bondage amen but I'm telling you whenever a son or daughter of God sees their name in the book they've got something to have a good old-fashioned jump and sing and shouting kind of a Revival in the deal because it is true that when we see who we are in Jesus Christ we'll never be the same person ever again Amen in that hour Jesus rejoiced in spirit and said I thank thee O Father Lord of Heaven and Earth that thou Hast hid these things from the wise and prudent and has revealed them into babes even so father for so it seemed good in thy sight now look at this my brother and sister he doesn't say some things here he doesn't put a quantifier on this all things are delivered to me of my father and no man knoweth who the son is but the father and who the father is but the son and he to whom the son will reveal him and he turned him to his he turned him to his disciples and said privately blessed are the eyes which see the things that you see for I tell you that many prophets and Kings desired to see those things which you see and have not seen them and to hear those things which you hear and have not heard them look at this my brother and sister a whole age chosen selected right the selected generation first Peter 2 9-10 amen the selected generation and given that my brother and sister that God said you know what there's going to come a final age a final time a final bride with a message comes all the way down in Revelation and says um my spirit and my bride are going to have the exact same language she's going to sound just like her husband she's not going to have another voice she's not going to have another agenda another idea but she's going to come and she's going to sound so much like him that they're gonna say is this now nobody's going to mistake Paul heylet for God but we saw that manifestation in this day my brother and sister before us that people saw so much of Christ Teo Osborne went on tape in a you know interview recorded that they literally thought they were looking at Jesus Christ it was so much there that impressed them to that my brother and sister and we'll say well well I'll never attain to that but you'll be God to your children you'll be God maybe to a neighbor you'll be God look our our little neighbor over the hill God has come down now I don't know what God will do in their family what God will do with her and her husband but both of her children I'll tell you go knock on her door and ask her what's happened to her children and she'll tell you two times God has come right down in their life and has healed her children and God is real now you might not want what we have but I'm not going to take what God has given her away from her she got to see answer a baby should be born with Down Syndrome the doctor and the last I visited with her the doctor still hadn't given up she goes back every few months for another test because they're just waiting for the Down Syndrome to manifest itself well why don't they just stop and look that God has already manifested himself but they're waiting to find something to prove this wasn't a miracle of God and a little boy caught up with an infection that went to his brain stem changed his personality made him violent and they were saying you'll just have to learn to live with this and we'll medicate him out of this situation to keep him toned down and to see how God would come and deliver that little boy now my brother and sister they might not come and sit in this church and say Amen to the message of this hour but they know that God Is A Healer and they know God is present and they know God has come to their house I'll let God deal with them amen all we got to do is be who God called us to be Amen to live the word at the level not just living the word but at the level God called us to be now if we're the queen of the house what level are we called to live at amen at the Queen's level amen and I I don't even know how to describe what the Queen's level is my brother and sister but I'll tell you the queen is not a beggar the queen is not one over here denying the power of the king the queen is over here saying my husband is in charge of everything what he says goes let's live at the queen level amen let's get away from being the beggar let's get away from being the one that wonders if God will come on this scene and start being the one that declares God is on the scene Hallelujah amen Hallelujah oh my God you see what we're doing sometimes is we're waiting for some point down the road here that this is all going to be manifested well I say my brother and sister were living the portion of this word for our day right here we're living it right now this is not a tomorrow message this is a today message this is not a yesterday message now don't misunderstand me I love to talk about the things that God used did in brother Brown's Ministry I love to recount and look at those things but my brother and sister I'm not living in 1963. I'm living in 2023. and I need a God today amen not tomorrow I need God today so is he going to be present or not do you realize it's all what we choose do you realize that we actually put God in the past in the present or the future ourself we can say my anticipation is when this and this happens in my life I get right with God my brother and sister we are putting God in the future amen if all we do is talk about what God did in brother branham's life we are putting God in the past but I want God to be in the present I want God to be here tonight that we can take the scriptures that we have shared tonight and these quotes as we went down through this how the church age and recognize that he is the ever-present help in our time of trouble not in history not in future but right here tonight amen that God is here to answer and to deal with our hearts amen because you see we're a living portion of scripture we can talk about whether the word is living I want to know are we living I want to be a living written epistle not a dead epistle a living epistle amen a Living Word to a present world you know and taking this out of the churches we already read it but he turned to his disciples said privately blessed are the eyes which have seen the things that you see amen you realize how blessed We Are Tonight Saints for I tell you that many prophets and Kings have desired to see those things which ye see and have not seen them sorry to sound carnal but most people would tell you wouldn't mind at all to live a little nicer house and live in a little drive a little nicer car and a little this and a little of that maybe out of zero or two in front of the decimal to our bank account and the Kings who have that money are looking at you saying I wished I could see what you see I wished I could hear what you hear and let me take it a little further maybe even in that day come to the place they would declare I wish I could have lived what you left they wouldn't care where the decimal point was they want what you have oh they already have the wealth they already have the fame they already have all of this but they want this what you have they desired to see that amen Hallelujah let me just hurry here if the musicians will come in the sermon second-handed Rome I really like this really really strikes my heart Elijah turned around go back and read catch what's in front of a catch what's behind it Elijah turned around the only thing he wanted to know was to ever get that promise that's what he wanted and he said now I'm going to ask you what tell you what my desire is is actually speaking of Elisha uh but I want a double portion of your spirit to come upon me what are you going to say Elijah the anointed Prophet turned around and said ask a hard thing you we want double of what I got but that's really hard thing you know my brother and sister when you run into uh brothers and sisters and families that are truly spiritual families that didn't just happen there's consecration there's dedication there's sacrifice Lord help us ask a hard thing but this will be given to you on a condition I like doing things on condition as I get older I really dislike doing things more and more on condition I want you to do this this and this and then we'll talk about this my brother and sister because I've done it others have done it we promise all kinds of things when this happens well I'm gonna I'm tell you I'm gonna do this I'm going to do this and you know I was talking to a man you know sometime back here and he told me he says brother Paul it's quite a drive from where I live but but I'm going to start being in church you're going to see me in church I'm going to be in church and I thought you know what I'm going to get all excited about this right after he's in church the first time and from that time to this time he's yet to fail to show up now I'm not judging him don't get me wrong but you see in the moment the enthusiasm of the moment it was like yes but I want to know do you still want to be in church on your worst day [Music] on your Wednesdays or as one Minister said what would happen if Church got moved from Sunday to Monday would you still show up [Music] you know the old joke about Mondays but you see my brother and sisters it's what we are it's who we are and he says right here turned around says to ask a hard thing but this will be given to you on a condition so is the Holy Ghost given to you on a condition see on conditions if you can meet the condition that is if you can see me while I go away you'll have what you ask for that's all Elisha wanted was the promise amen if he know the promise and the conditions of the promise then he kept his eyes right on Elijah and I can imagine somebody saying sir what are you bothering him for I ain't got no time to talk to you I'm looking straight at him and today the promise many of you here is sick and the promise is to you if thou can'tst believe you've got the promise the promise is laid down here in the Bible the promise is yours but the trouble of it you let the schools of the prophets and everything else call you from one side to the other side telling you discouraging and telling you days of Miracles has passed well what if it is my brother and sister that you have claimed your healing amen and you believe them days of Miracles are still present but you have claimed your healing and all you testify of what is still wrong with you Lord help us amen we say we're healed but all we can talk about is what our problem is God help every one of us amen oh now look at this you let the schools of the prophets and be pretty hard in this day my brother and sister everything else call you from one side to the other telling you discouraging telling you days of Miracles past no such thing it's mind reading well we must be living in that day because that spirit's around and if it's mind reading I say a thank you Lord because we're called to have the mind of Christ now Jesus Christ could discern the spirits that were there and that gift come down on a prophet and discern the spirits that were there [Music] imagine you've come to some special meetings you check into Motel and all night long you toss and turn and your mind is consumed brother Branham is God [Music] and you get up the next day and you go to church and you're still tormented is this God speaking to me what is this is Brother Branham Jesus Christ and have a prophet cut right through all the chatter and say oh it's all right brother and sister [Music] people who stayed in the room the night before believe I am Jesus Christ now my brother and sister you won't call it psychology that's fine but now you got a whole picture that it shows that somebody left a spirit behind in a room Lord help us to leave the right kind of spirit in the room maybe we could leave a spirit in a motel room that they'd dig their Gideon out of the drawer and read it maybe we could leave such a spirit in the workplace the break room or wherever it might be that people would say you know what I need to serve God you see my brother and sister telepathy mind reading psychology all of those things are nothing but a distraction from the Devil he's trying to speak to the mind of the True Believer to Sidetrack him what is it the prophet of God said it's a scarecrow what are scarecrows designed for scare you away from but I'm telling you he's wooed us he's called us his his wined and dined us if you don't mind me putting it that way drawing us to him no such thing it's mind reading mental telepathy and all those things and you listen to it and that's the reason you don't receive the promise I can imagine Elisha following Elijah with him Eyes straight on him he wasn't going to turn or see or didn't turn back or say hey fellas how do you think I'm doing imagine now you see him as Elijah is walking along here is Elijah Elisha I mean he's so focused you know if I sit right here and picked any one of you and just sit here and stared at you you're a little uneasy after a while well here's Elisha following Elijah knowing that if I turn my eyes away for a moment and he's gone I miss the promise how could we come to a place God help us to come to a place we're that focused on Jesus Christ amen I don't want to miss one thing that you're doing Lord I don't want to miss one thing that you have called me to do one Deliverance one Revelation one unction one moving of the spirit I don't want to miss it Lord I'm going to keep my eyes focused on you I know I don't got time to turn over here I don't have time to turn over there I've only got time to keep my eyes on Jesus Christ [Music] amen he wasn't going to turn or see or didn't turn back and say hey fellas how do you think I'm doing if he would oh sorry about that we'll get in if he would Elijah might have been taken away and he wouldn't have got the promise and when we turn aside today looking at this and looking at conditions and looking at symptoms symptoms always say now look I was prayed for last night you see my hand is no better it will never be like no sir you don't look at the symptom you look at the promise amen that promise is what it is look who made the promise it was God who made the promise and it's God's word who's in authority and it's God who spoke the promise that's who it is and you look at your symptoms symptoms are the greatest hindrance God has to work with symptoms oh Lord help us to put every symptom we have behind us and say I don't care about the feeling the symptom of my emotion or the symptom of My Flesh or the symptom of my losing the joy of my salvation I'm gonna look to the word and I'm not going to take my eyes off the word hallelujah
