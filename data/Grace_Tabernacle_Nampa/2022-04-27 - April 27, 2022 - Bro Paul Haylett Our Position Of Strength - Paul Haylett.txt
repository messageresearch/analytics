come forth as a sweet odor before the throne of god oh how we love you today lord how we love you oh hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah [Music] amen brother jay that's a beautiful song hallelujah amen just love there's some songs that just resonate something down in your soul that's that would be one of them amen let's continue to sing that hallelujah uh saints i just want to bring up a couple little things i just sincerely desire your prayers there is um some things that have transpired in this week um that very heavy burden upon my heart and you know sometimes the the lord you might say he reaches outside of this pasture and desires for us to to you might say um carry or enter into burdens to needs and and uh just have some very heavy very heavy uh burdens upon my heart i just uh desire your prayers amen i'd like to speak to you tonight god bless you thank you beautiful beautiful song service uh i would like to speak to you this evening our position of strength and uh i'd like to just bring this as just an encouragement we're not going to talk about how you get into that strength because you see it's already been delivered to us we don't have to say now i'm i'm going to go become a strong christian we'll to the very end lord willing in a quote we'll we'll kind of tie that in but my brother and sister you see the doctrines you might say of the message are important are they not but remember the theme song that the prophet had i've been reading and i've been studying and i i just can't get over how deep brother branham's theme song really means to us as he tried to present it to us not forcing us to take his theme song as our theme song but to realize just how important it is to just only believe i don't have answers neither do i but i believe in the one who does i might bear sickness within my body and i've gone to doctors and i've taken my vitamins and my pills and this and that but i serve the one who made this body and i believe him when he said i am your healer i believe him and we could go on and take the whole service just touching on each one of these and i don't think it's necessary but it really comes down my brother and sister that we just have to believe we've already been given the position of strength because you say well i'm so weak that's right he said when you're weak i'm strong now this isn't you know there's marital relationship that that oftentimes we see this happen and and when one spouse is very strong in a situation the other one needs that strength and they counter balance each other but you'll notice that god never said now when you're strong you'll cover my weakness no no no no no he said just be weak be weak just lay yourself down realize i can't do this but the christ the anointed one see it's not about let's just oh jesus christ my brother and sister he wants to be the anointed one and we're the one you might say in our own life that's here to anoint him oh remember that little lady that come in poured out the oil on our lord jesus's feet brother branham uses her as an example sometimes about the christians of the day who would never be able to dry his feet with their hair because they'd have to stand on their head this is an amazing god provided everything she needed to do and provided the lamb and the lamb was right there no one else wanted to acknowledge the lamb so do you realize this is two sides to look at this story god provided her deliverance and she provided the true anointed worship that should have been in that house see how god always balances this out said not only am i going to let her find redemption for her soul i'm going to let her of all people be the one who worships me see all the fine finery sophistication wealth position couldn't worship him let's never get lifted up church let's remain humble before our lord psalms the 18th chapter the first three verses will lay down the foundation of what what this really stirs in my heart tonight now we see different ways that the scripture is laid out we're actually going to skip right down to the end he said and he said i will love thee oh lord my strength a great acknowledgement that there was no great man who was a ruler of a kingdom a great man that was honored amongst the people and cherished he's speaking now i will love thee oh lord my strength the lord is my rock right that's the foundation and my fortress and my deliver my god my strength in whom i will trust my buckler and the horn of my salvation and my high power which is a refuge i will call upon the lord who is worthy to be praised that's why that's i just have to say the song touched me and maybe slightly different fashion than it would touch to you i believe the same but just another little little touch because of what we're thinking tonight it's worthy to be praised saints worthy for us to break all the barriers of i am tired i'm weary i'm discouraged i'm this i'm that and lift hands to give praise to him this is not about well i don't want to be conspicuous forget those anointings that the devil would throw out what will people think who cares what people think nobody's going to come back after the rapture and go to their neighbor and say now what do you think it's time for us to just think about what god thinks and say lord all i care about is what you think i will call upon the lord who is worthy to be praised so shall i be saved from mine enemies do you realize in the context of this sentence it is in this activity david's making a declaration in this activity so shall i be saved from my enemies in other words i'm going to have to call on him and i'm going to have to give him praise and i'm going to have to be the one who opens my mouth and declares him to be my rock to be my fortress to be my deliverer to be my god be my strength we can't hold that in and be as it were the secret believer god wants to hear our voice god doesn't want a silent bride he wants a bride that's willing to tell him you know in the natural you know a man likes to hear you know that that uh thank you honey for for laboring for me thank you lord for being a provider i'm to the husband i mean and and thank you for these things that are done there's a little boy in every one of us and although we recognize it might be our responsibility to haul out the trash we like to also be thanked for hauling out the trash did you hear that wives but it's your job it is but you know how antagonized you are when it doesn't happen god's not antagonized my brother and sister when we don't give praise to him actually his heart is broken then all that he's done has no more response than that heavenly father we ask for your blessings on the word this evening lord ask you to lead us guide us strengthen us in your precious name amen you may be seated i forgot to give this little preliminary announcement um april 30th is a saturday and 39 years ago it was a saturday and uh sister jerry and i will slip off for a couple days to celebrate our anniversary and i'd like to say it's been 39 years of wedded bliss but um praise the lord she had no clue who she was marrying 39 years ago and uh but it's been good god is gracious and so we covet your prayers brother chris will be ministering this coming sunday amen now as we look at this i just want to call your attention that as we look at this my brother and sister we need to identify with these words they shouldn't just be words that we read and say okay that was good uh david you know he spoke those words that's wonderful we need to identify with these words now to say amen to every word of god right the prophet of god now we can choose different ways but there's basically six different ways the prophet of god uh uh speaks this and my brother and sister he says one of the identifications of having the holy ghost is to say amen to every word of god now we would think that a person could just simply impersonate saying amen to every word of god but let's just look at baptism just quickly the two-thirds of the christian world or more actually could not say amen to acts 2 38. now they put it in a context of yes that's scripture that's beautiful but they don't act upon it so amen means so be it which is also part of the equation of us acting on the word so it's there that we realize that to say amen to every word of god you're going to have to have the holy ghost it's not going to be no educated person my brother and sister it's going to be the anointing of god himself on you so to identify with that word you're going to have to say amen to it so i just pray that the lord just comes and moves upon us and stirs our heart day by day that we don't simply say amen have you ever sat in church and because 932 other people said amen you said amen never right because you never sat in a church with 932 people how about with 50 people do that my brother and sister people say amen to the word oh my you're going to draw me into a i have set in services where men spoke from the pulpit of the church they were in things that were absolutely contrary to the bible and shocked that half a church says amen to that see sometimes people don't realize what they're saying amen to that's why it's our responsibility to get into the word right and to study to show ourselves approved is not a equation if i'm going to be a preacher it is my brother and sister part of that well done my good and faithful servant is to study the word that you know what to say amen to because it is real it's the holy ghost speaking through you to you amen etc so as you look at that we we need to find a place that we fully identify with the word of god now my brother and sister if we're sitting here tonight and we are you might say upset or have some little root of something taking place because god hasn't healed you then you are not in harmony with the word amen if you don't believe god is your provider tonight then you are not in harmony with the word and this goes on down to the list of the things that are natural or normal to humanity that if we find ourselves uh you might say uh roughed up over things that we think god should have done now you want an example i'll just throw you one real quick here the prophet of god goes to pray for that little girl and she dies and brother branham goes back and tells god you owe me an apology now god didn't say oh my i'm sorry no what did god do just let him set brother branham uses the word himself i think moped or something of that nature so he's over there just god owes me an apology but in the meantime you'll notice that god had given him a vision and in the context of that when he comes to pray for a child he knows something's wrong now see how this is he doesn't come back and say okay now that's two strikes lord no he realizes the fault is in himself he realizes his ability to pray for the child and see the supernatural take place in that child is not upon him as a man but it's all upon the lord jesus christ and him being in the right position to be the conduit and so as the word was manifest god is working in our life and so we have to come and there would be times you know i wish sometimes except for if it was me but i wish sometimes that people would just really really realize how strongly their thoughts are projected how their their resistance to what is preached or the circumstance how that it would rise up because it would cause a lot of people to behave differently when they realize they're not pushing against the preacher he might feel it but you're actually pushing against god and so it's there that we want to be able to say amen to every word with freedom with liberty that's why we should be praying lord show us guide us lord i'm coming to church hungry tonight because i want you to show if there's something wrong with my life or in my household as it were the circumstances surrounding because lord i want to be closer to you i want to be right and so that's the thing about us coming to a place that we must identify with the word and you say but i live maybe a household where you know not everyone's a believer and there's certain spirits that are there god's already provided for you amen god's provided the way for you he's given you that stalwart solid grasp on the word that these spirits of unbelief would not wipe you or wash you away amen hallelujah you see because this word my brother and sister now this is going to be hard because sometimes my wife says well i think you've got a grumpy spirit on you you know i i just say that in humor tonight so don't don't get too you know because it's like oh smile paul you can do it now i know that doesn't happen in your house but you see we're right here in the 18th chapter of psalm again and we want to go down to the 29th verse and just take an example of what david's experience of saying amen to the word and acting upon the word and professing the position that god is in his life he was not without uh struggles he had children that wanted to overthrow him he made mistakes concerning the kingdom god had to chastise him he had uh relationships that god said you know what you're going to pay a heavy price for this relationship but god didn't cast him out he knew then that how much god loved him because his relationship was such as it were that it should have been the finish of david's ministry as it were or his leadership in the kingdom it should have been the finish but god said i love you so much david but david you're going to pay a heavy price for this well i'll tell you what my brother and sister i i pray the blood of jesus christ covers every bad decision we ever made but i tell you what's more important than that i'm not justifying that side of it but i'm telling you what's more important that god loves us because we could say i'm trying to do my very best i don't do nothing so that i don't make a mistake that's a mistake we're supposed to project jesus christ and we don't always do a real good job do we there's times we open our mouth and we wish we'd have just kept our mouth shut because we seem to be blundering along but god is gracious now look at psalms 29 18 29 for by thee now david still in my opinion kind of prophesying his natural position and his spiritual position you see because you can't have a divide my brother and sister between your natural position and your spiritual position you can't say i'm filled with the holy ghost and be a bank robber you can't be the biggest liar in the church and say i've got the holy ghost there is a direct interconnection with the carnal flesh man and the spirit otherwise we have to go find us a two soul church and there's not one in the valley that i know of so we'd have to go start one but we'd probably find a few people that would come with us than happy to rob banks by day and go to church by night but look what he says all the david's problems have come upon him but he comes along and says for by thee i have run through a troop and by my god have i leaped over a wall hallelujah every one of his enemies he was not cut down by them he was not hamstrung by them but he ran through them left every single bit of the carnal every bit of those things that were afflicting him and yet there was more to come right it cost him he never got to build the tabernacle my brother and sister because of decisions that he made and things that happened and he knew that in his old age but yet there was still a something that gripped his heart because he knew the love of god he knew that god had declared as it were that he was a man after god's own heart maybe god didn't speak those direct words right to david but there was that assurance of who he was and because of that he kept running hallelujah he never said hey i made a mistake today i gotta stop and just let everything that's happening fall down because i made a mistake it's just all going to come to a blundering halt no i'm telling you why he ran my brother and sister he's still just like you and i day by day lord forgive me lord forgive me so he said i for by thee i run through a troop and by my god have i leaped over a wall as for god his way is perfect can we acknowledge that today hallelujah he didn't say his way was easy he said it was perfect the word of the lord is tried do you know my brother and sister this spoke to me so much do you realize as we read this that we read hebrews 11 of the saints of old do you realize every promise and every example and everything that was done in this bible if you and i will put forth the effort serving god god will do the magnificent supernatural incredible i don't know enough words tonight to magnify that god will do it for you because this is already tried this is not a new experimental religion this is not a new hey god's got something new on the scene let's see if it will work today my brother and sister we can take a hold of this and say if you need healing my god is a healer you need a deliverance my god is a deliverer there's no hope so there's no i think so we can say this is my absolute because it is a word that has been tried and proven oh thank you lord hallelujah the word of the lord is tried he is a buckler to all who that trust in him for who is god save the lord and who is a rock save our god my brother and sister this scripture gives us example about building on the rock now if the word of god declared that the storms would come we faced them haven't we has everyone that's built faced a storm aren't you glad you had enough revelation to build it on the rock you know we see people now just bear with me if you would we see people they build their house on the rock but the carport's on the sand and they're shocked when they wake up in the morning and the carport's gone now you see that's because they've tried to straddle they've tried to straddle and god says you know what you can't straddle so what i'm going to do is actually do you a favor of the things in your life that you are doing that will not stand the test i'm going to tear it down for you now can somebody say thank you lord for tearing it down now because if it won't stand the tap test we don't want to get all the way to the end and have it fail then i say lord judge us now judge us now lord that the foundation that we have built upon will stand in laodicea hallelujah who is a rock save our god it is god that girdeth me with strength and maketh my way perfect now if we're going to believe the words of david are we going to believe the words of david these words are just as tried and tested as the words of the apostles david faced things challenges his own lust of the flesh pride of life his own ego his own whatever everything that could have gotten away in david's life got in the way but his life proves that when you come to god sincerely aren't you glad we can be anointed with a spirit of sincerity we don't often hear that preached about the spirit of sincerity but my brother and sister we can go through the word of god and read it like a novel and then wonder why it doesn't work but a sincere approach to the word of god the prophet of god put it in words my brother and sister giving us the security to know that if we would come he said you know what whatever you're doing check your motive well i don't want to go to hell wrong motive reminds me of a story i read once about a king come to a place in his life that he so distrusted everyone kicked his own wife from his room chained the doors from within every single night because that was the only sin security that he had and he become angry and he become bitter and the more angry he become and the more bitter he become the more insecure he become and he got bigger chains and more things to keep people from getting in and a wise man come to him one day and said oh king can i share wisdom and he said share wisdom and he says you can love the people into your very heart and he leaves and the king's like i don't understand what he means but as he ponders it we'd call it revelation as he ponders it he starts to realize all the people i've distrusted they're still there they still love me and i would be secure if i would love them back very simple thought you see that's what god's doing he's loving us back in our own insecurities he's loving us back in our own weakness our own frailty of humanity he's loving us back he's wooing us to himself now i want to touch on verse 32 the word girded you realize my brother and sister we talk about christ in us the hope of glory but you look at this scripture now it is god that girdeth me with strength he's wrapping his strength around us we could say well praise the lord i'm a christian now i've i've got great strength and you would try to rely upon your strength that you believe you have in you and you would find yourself failing but when we realized god's wrapping his strength around it's it's when you wrap we are here tonight each one of us clothed in in cloth and clothes of of different designs and whatever that that cloth does not become part of you i don't want to sound crass but we will go home tonight and we'll jump in our jammies and the nice dress and the nice uh certain tie or whatever that it would be it all goes on a hanger or goes in a hamper that clothes did not become a permanent part of you it is there wrapped around you and we can realize my brother and sister we have to stand and submit and let god gird us with strength we can't tell god i'm powerful i don't need this i don't need this i don't need this we've got to stand if i could demonstrate this in such a fashion we've got to stand as the tailor i had one suit tailored i think it was in my life and it was experience i wasn't real thrilled with you know you know they're there and you know the whole time they're flashing their hands the lady actually turned out to be phenomenal but do you know it's there that it's there and it's got a little bit here and a little bit there and you got to pull this there and you know you have a little bump here and we need to hide that so we're going to loosen the shirt up like this and pull it this way and do this and that is the shoulders needs to be perfect this way and the the the deal you can tell i just buy shirts off the rack now but you know the link's got to be just right actually sister jerry puts a lot of effort in for me to look halfway presentable but you see you have to stand there and when the tailor says turn you have to turn put your arms down lift your arms up do this do that even really good tailors will ask you where do you carry your wallet and they'll want the wallet to be in the pocket so that they can adjust the pocket to where it looks the same do you see it saints god says i want to make you the strongest i want to make you powerful but you're going to have to stop and stand and let me wrap myself around you and i will cover your insecurity i will cover your weakness i will cover your complex and i'll even take your strengths and i'll make it to where you recognize your strength is no longer as important as you thought your strength was because we're now wrapped what in his strength we're now wrapped in the word of god because the word is the very very heart of god it was such an expression he put it to the page that we could carry it and read it and hold it and find security in it because we're humans and those things matter to us but you see we've got to stop long enough you imagine a tailor in the natural before we move on you imagine a tailor in the natural and you'd be walking around the room maybe on your telephone and they're trying to adjust your suit and your shirt and skirt and whatever it might be and you're just uh well you know just oh i can only imagine what that would look like worse yet what it would be feel like sorry but you see to be girded with strength we have got to stop amen and if he says i hope you follow me tonight i'm not trying to force anybody to do any behavior i just have to speak my heart he's there and as the tailor says paul i want you to lift your hands because i want to see if the shirt pulls right is there enough room within the shirt sleeves and so is to lift your hands and so as a natural tailor would be there saying i need you to lift one hand another hand both hands i need you to do these things god is here tailoring his word to you and i saying i'd like you to lift your hands i'd like you to know what it feels like when you're wrapped in strength of god when you're wrapped in the word of god to be able to lift your hands and say i think lord wrapped in your word that i look good but lord i need your word of security that i truly look good otherwise it'll be in our own thinking i'm such a good believer i've been in the message as i get older just so if you guys ever see a negative reaction from me as i get older you might say i'm just going to use a very abrasive word so that anything after that will be less right it irritates me when people stand there well i've been in the message for 40 years good you've been in the message 40 years how long has the message been in you come on saints how long have you stood still and let the word of god gird you oh that's hard my brother and sister and i don't mean it to be to be abrasive but it is something that i just feel like the lord laid upon our heart that we have to realize we got to stop and we'll reaffirm that in just a little bit amen now i want to ask you saints can we trust the lord enough to claim his word as our own amen oh the religious world and the critics that all just freak out but this is my word yeah every word in this book right here is my word but you some of it's for the unbeliever right but you know why that's there it's there for you as a reminder it doesn't apply when god said it's not for the idolaters we're not idolaters so it doesn't apply to us but it reminds us we don't want to fall under a spirit of idolatry it reminds us of the things we don't want to do kind of like you know i remember one time years ago i got pulled over for speeding and uh and the man i happen to know him and that makes it worse and he says so paul why was you driving too fast on this road that you drive all the time and you know human nature i hope you don't want to vote me out over this human nature is you're going to find an excuse okay now moment of truth how many of you think first to offer up the excuse come on okay i see some heads nodding so the next step of sincerity would be your hand being lifted but anyway we'll settle for what we've got and i just looked at him and i said i don't know okay just keep it down it walks off but it was an eye-opener to me the first thoughts that rolled across was to conjure up an excuse i you know i've got um i don't know god doesn't want our excuses saints let's stop we have been girded with the strength of the word which is the holy ghost what we need is that submission not the excuse let the first anointing that comes on us be the anointing of lord you've wrapped me in strength i can do better i can do better than i don't need to offer an excuse well it's because of this i can't serve the lord it's because of this i can't serve the lord it was because of them forget that when you come face to face in that stop and just say lord you have girded me with strength and you have made my way perfect and i'm going to live that i can live that i will live that you imagine standing before god and trying to give him an original excuse wow you get a pass i've never heard that one before that's also why i believe that within the body of believers you'll find people that suffer from every single malady whether it's health emotional whatever it is you'll find people that have come from circumstances that are so dark and so deep they don't even want to talk about it in public and the reason that's going to happen my brother and sister you say but if god was such a loving god you got to understand god doesn't think like we do his ways are so much higher than our ways but i believe i'm on the right track here i don't believe i'm wrong in the fact that you're going to find in this body of believers people suffering from every malady because people will come one day and say i was molested as a child that's why i can't serve god and in the host of the believers there will be i was too i was too i was too and on right down through the line and my brother and sister that breaks our heart just even thinking about that but god oh if i could put it without sounding so based god has covered all the bases no one's going to come with an original excuse to god and so in that god has brought us to a place that we can trust him enough to say this is my word amen this is who i am and this is the life i was called to live oh my brother and sister i hope that soaks in real deep amen now let's just look in ephesians 3 for just a moment now i'm just going to throw this out i had a brother challenge me with this before and i got kind of through all of it but i didn't honestly go through all of it he said have you read all of the 3 16s in the bible it's kind of interesting because you go through the bible and there's some really profound things in the third chapter and the 16th verse going on through the bible anyway just a little brain teaser you might say for you no doctrines there no must must do just kind of interesting ephesians 3 16 that he would grant you according to the riches of his glory isn't this a good one to be strengthened with might by his spirit in the inner man now i tell you my brother and sister there's a lot of people around that would come very boldly in a carnal or physical realm as a believer you're gonna believe this and you'll do this and you'll do that but we're not looking for that kind of leadership are we we're looking for the leadership that skips right by this old flesh right here and moves right down by the spirit into the inner man oh if i couldn't god would grant it to me i would get you guys all just to so open up tonight that you would be vulnerable oh this sounds scary brother paul wants us to be vulnerable yes sir so that we could shovel the riches of his glory by the might of his spirit in the inner man just just to fill it up just to fill it up trust god trust god that's what he wants to do for you and i saints amen he wants to strengthen us by his spirit not intellectualism not boisterous or forceful in our personality but in the inner man in the spirit realm amen that christ may dwell in your hearts by faith that ye being rooted and grounded in doctrines we've got a problem in the message saints we getting dog fights over doctrine i've been guilty joking with brother jason in the back room it's pretty tough i mean you got to really get down and repent god when your thoughts was i'm going to kill this guy no you got i'm serious saints that might have come across a little humorous but i'm serious because we'll never have to pull a gun out we'll never have to have a knife or a hatchet or whatever it might be never see him in the crosswalk i just accidentally hit the gas then i had to back up and see if well anyway no see dwell in our hearts by faith that we being rooted and grounded in love and the prophet of god said without perfect love we won't make it anyhow i lift my hands tonight and say lord help me help me lord that i could have perfect love i don't want to just talk about it saying i wanted to captivate my life i wanted to captivate your life i wanted that we could come to a place that say i don't see it that way in the scripture or in the message that's fine brother i love you i love you and let's just keep on loving each other until the lord reveals that one or both of us is wrong don't you like that when you're in an argument and you just know they're wrong but along in the argument you realize you're wrong also man that is a that is a paradox i mean that would just cause you to stop and just go ah what may be able to comprehend with all saints what is the breadth length depth and height is this possible saints yes the word of god says i'm going to just paraphrase it before it's all over the full mystery of christ will be revealed let's start working on it amen we don't have rosaries but add it to your prayer list amen because we need to come to a place that we are not affected by the carnal spirits of this age amen and to know the love of christ right there's personal amen now i don't mean to pick on brother david but it's a very strong theme and i'm glad he carries it and it's not giving up on it and that is you must be born again you don't think that sentence says that do you but that's what it says right there and to know the love of christ ye must be born again to know the love of christ there is no way we can say i just feel so lovey i i won't go into it but i'm telling you i've interacted with people in just the last while that their idea of loving each other is that you compromise on your doctor and i'll compromise on our doctrine and we'll just come together and worship together i'm sorry my brother and sister i'm not compromising that's not love amen i gotta love this word right to have the love of christ means i've got to have an unshakable love in the word thank you amen you might be filled with the fullness of god now unto him that is able to do exceeding abundantly above all that we ask or think according to the power that worketh in us amen is there anybody here that this scripture applies to tonight amen this is a word that's a living word this is not something we dug off the shelf and knocked a layer or two of dirt off of and said oh look what this was written back in history this is living tonight saint this is the very power of god that he said i'm going to give you this power to take this word and to love when you thought it was unlovable to forgive when you thought it was unforgivable to give patience and kindness and charity to those you weren't sure were worth it now let's be honest with ourselves there's times that we've looked at people and thought man they don't even deserve grace they need judgment but you know the firing squad always works better when there's three or more and if we got our way we'd find ourselves standing next to them saying wait i was judging you why am i on the firing line come on lord help us that's all i can say saints lord help us but he said that he is able to do the exceeding abundantly all that we ask or think now i'm going to ask you are you self-limiting god i need god to do something but i'm not worthy i made a mistake this last week brother paul i made a mistake five years ago and i'm still paying the price for it today good i have found a law that pardons me no no no no i have found a love that pardons and i want to share the love of jesus christ with everybody around me because i know that what i have meted out shall be meted unto me according to the power that worketh in us become an eternal thing unto him be glory in the church by christ jesus throughout all ages world without end amen now let me just hurry along right here we'll just go right into this 1958 his wonders to perform oh if christ is presented in the right way feel free to speak out what is the right way if you don't believe i'll let me let me give you the right way circa 19 70 6. if you don't believe this message you are going to hell is that the way to present the message well it sure appears to me your serpent seed first off the denominational christian won't even know what you're talking about when you mention serpent seed and then you've just decided that you have some kind of supernatural to just know i saw your tail flicker no my brother and sister those are old denominations critical spirits that wouldn't even give the speaker into the rapture god help us god help us but god's given us a strength saint what is that strength oh let me just kind of cut a little bit to the line here that strength is to live this message day by day by day by day walking walking and people will be saying in these times that we live in in these circumstances here look at the saints in the ukraine the world my brother and sister will marvel of how a people could stand so solid on the word of god in that time it's one thing to have national pride and and there's certainly nothing wrong with loving your country but we love jesus christ way more than we love our country and we can stand in the worst of times fight for our country but fight for this gospel and how do we fight for this gospel by presenting christ in the right way the world will respect it i i'll tell you i've got a i've got a lot of friends that haven't darkened the door of a church in years haven't picked up a bible in years they acknowledge that god is real but they use him as curse word more than they speak about him in any other fashion and i know i've shared this and i don't mean to make it about me but i've walked in before when the little store was there at that time and they're all rowdy and i'd go up there and get some of that really really nutritious uh convenience store burritos you know the ones that are filled with vitamins and give you a lot of a lot of strength and you go sit down at the table and you bow your head and the table goes silent now they didn't go silent because they think you're freaking a geek and they're all staring at you they went silent because they respect praise the lord the world will respect it if there's any respect in them certainly it is if it's brought the way of divine light that night now brother brown's talking about a time and a service and a church service and a man here you'll catch that here that night when we left the church he had a lantern in his hand said i would i'd give anything parson if i could only believe that god would forgive me of my sin now we're not dealing with a guy that stole some gum out of the old country store i've killed two or three men now he's coming face to face with god knowing he's a murderer and no doubt other sins to go with it and he's struggling with something that all of us struggle with well let me put it this way all of you that have a past by god's grace some of you raise up serve god all the days of your life and you're not guilty of a lot of things but we we oh where'd this go on and i know i'm a guilty sinner but when i seen them things happen in that great big magnificent church what's wrong with the saints that we think that somehow god's more present in the bigger building god's present in his tabernacle amen he said we're two or three thousand are gathered together in my name no sir god cut it right down to the chase and made it right down into the base of simplicity that you can come where two or three are gathered in my name you know what that could be that i don't mean to lift up the preacher don't misunderstand me but that could just be the preacher and an unbeliever unbeliever this desiring god when i see them things happen in that little church i'm aware that there is a true and living god see this is part of that correct presentation that little church and the man's realizing there's a true god there's a real god will forgive you i said he will forgive you and he wants to forgive you that's something i think we overlook sometimes saying so i hope i'm not belaboring this too much but this all just spoke to me so much he once he wants saints can i say it with sincerity enough he wants to forgive us and we fight and we hide and we make excuses for why i can't come and do this and god's there saying please please just come receive it he wants to forgive you and the very hunger in your heart means that he's working on your soul isn't that beautiful now look at this he said if i could only feel it now brother brown look at this he's kind of confident isn't he you'll feel it when you get this correct you'll feel it praise god i'm such a good christian that's not the kind of strength he promised us oh no not a preacher that's like if you don't straighten up i'll come back there and slap you out in the aisle and drag you up here to the altar no no no that's not what he's looking for he's looking for a life that is such a perfect mirror that's reflecting christ back isn't that wonderful amen when i feel it i'll believe it this is a powerful line right here saints believe it and then you'll feel it people get this back i i i attended that church just didn't seem nothing happened to me uh you know i don't i don't i don't know why they have to you know them women ah this is the conversation i had right on that step one time i don't know why you'd have a woman have to not cut her hair and wear a dress i don't get it but you just told me that you have not felt the presence of god in years in a church like you felt this morning but i didn't feel it i didn't feel it all the way down here well how far do you got to feel it how far do you got to feel it saints it's the word of god believe it then you'll feel it i wished i know how to do it i said where do you live across the mountain about two miles how did you get there how do you get there up over the ridges and through the pass i said it's very dark but i got a lantern you can't see your house with your lantern no that's right then how do you know you're going to get there just take the lantern in your hand and you're standing in the light you walk in the right direction every step you make the light will light up the road i said that's the way you find christ stand in his light i want to interject this right now so i don't have to circle back you want to get strong you want to have supernatural strength get in the light walk in the light i'll just throw a personal antidote in here just because we're as good as finished from my childhood i got addicted to rock and roll and the closer i got to god the harder the battle was to deal with this i've gotten serious trouble from sisters here in this church from just making little quips about those things from the past so so i lord lord willing i'll be done forever to even bring another one of those up but you see those things come and let me just let let me just give you just a little bit of this brother paul used to be pretty good at riding a dirt bike i was an adrenaline junkie and i discovered when i was probably about 16 had my own pickup i could almost assure that i would have a wonderful day riding my bike if i listened to certain music going out to the desert and i would get out of the pickup and i would already be just oh man literally i don't want to be too graphic but i'd be pulling on my riding gear and i would literally have such an adrenaline rush just from music i didn't need any drugs i just already just and guys i rode with used to say man paul you are so weird and i tell them yeah but let's ride then i'd leave him in the dust i'd have to stop out in the middle of the desert out there and wait for him and they're like we don't know how you do it but god revealed it to me how i did it i was building my carport on the sand and the devil liked the idea that i was building my carport on the sand and he give me a strength or you followed me but you see i come one day just like all of you have had to come and some will still have to come and realize you know what the only way i'm ever going to find christ brother harold hildebrand preached a service many years ago i promise you saints i have never mistreated you that way i have never stood and stared at you the whole service that's what brother harold did to me or at least that's what i thought he did and he made a declaration over the pulp in the little church in star idaho about if you're ever going to meet christ you've got to give up everything that's an enemy to christ and i realized i was holding on to these things have you guys ever had a really really serious weekly adrenaline rush like you just had to go get it again and i didn't have to go to an alley i didn't have to go to a back street i could just go out in god's creation but it controlled my life but i come along and just like this man saying how am i going to do this just like brother brown speaking there that's why this is real to me saints that's why it stirred my heart when i read this he's telling him every step you make the light will light up the road i said that's the way you find christ you've got to get the lantern out and you've got to hold it in front of you you don't hold that lanyard behind you you don't leave it in the trail you hold it out and you let it shine the light on what's before you amen and so brother brown says see stand in his blessings stand in his power now i'm taking this word right here even though power doesn't necessarily mean strength but i i trust you'll give me that grace to just let that carry right over into that we want a supernatural power we want the strength of almighty god and we come sometimes say how is this i can't seem to find it to overcome or to to meet the challenge of the day and it's there he says now you've got to stand in his power let's go back to my early statement i didn't even think i'd preach this long i thought we'd be gone stand in his power don't drive off don't walk off don't climb up don't do this don't people say excuse me people say well i listen to the prophet while i do my dishes i'm a hardliner you're either listening to the prophet or you're doing your dishes but you really can't get the full depth of that doing both right just an opinion i'll put it that way i don't know but he promised oh he says stand in his power if you're sick how are you going to get well i don't know but he promised to do it and the holy spirit is a witness of his light and his resurrection just walk in the light and go the right directions towards calvary and it'll lead you to your healing and to your blessing just take the light with you as you go my brother and sister this is the thing that we must do we cannot set the very lantern down that is providing the light to us it'll work for a while but we'll never get home we'll never get home because the time we start to get close to home are you with me you'll be walking in darkness again i'm telling you oh i shouldn't be so direct forgive me but i'm telling you there's a mini a message believer has set his lantern down and he says i walked in the light is it present tense or past tense lord help it to be present tense not i walked as in past tense but to be i am walking in the light and you say brother paul how does this come together with looking at this in our position of strength well i'll tell you how it'll be my brother and sister it'll take strength to keep walking in the light it will take strength and that strength is comes from almighty god and he has given it to us tonight we are not here hoping or begging or looking for something to show up it's right here in our fingertips in our hearts amen in our mind in our mouth amen we have the supernatural strength that the word of god promised to deliver us to the finish line oh people say i don't feel like i have any strength brother paul i don't feel like i have any power i don't feel like i'm worthy i don't feel like that i want you to stop and i want you to go see what the bible says about you no no don't let the devil anoint you to the pages concerning judas that's the devil remember what the prophet of god said if god's dealing with you still there it is thank you lord i'm telling you it's getting saints i can't speak for you i can't even speak for my own wife or children or grandchildren but i'm telling you that god is just putting the hammer down on me that come over good look i shared with you the other day trying to be transparent with you i'm no different you are god called me to stand behind a pulpit but i'm no different you are and i've got my little library room and it's coming together i've got these shelves and i've got books and the message and some other you know things goofy westerns that we read from the time we could read but i'm picking books up books that i have had my possession for 25 30 years walking over it's like i probably should take this good will why poison somebody else's mind if god convicted you that it was poison your mind why would you poison someone else's mind with it so i'm pulling the drawer out and i'm dropping them in there yeah and the wife i'm going to tell on her a little bit i'm trying to get out of the habit of throwing her under the bus i don't want to have all the body shops complaining about how to fix their bus the wife what are you going to do with these books she comes in and sets them down on my desk and i pick one up is the reader's digest condensed there's four stories in there now that story's junk that's right oh that's a good story maybe i'll keep this one i mean after all it wasn't too provocative of a babylonian garment i buried in my tent brother paul out to lunch or did i just hit the mark i don't know but he promised to do it and the holy spirit's a witness of his light and his resurrection just walk in the light go the right directions for calvary he'll lead you to your healing your blessing just take the light with you as you go isn't that beautiful i like that amen thank you for giving me liberty to turn power into strength amen hallelujah you see we'll turn to isaiah 40 please come musicians but they that are busy in laodicea will receive a supernatural dispensation of the word to make up for the spirit of laodicea you'll get a quadruple portion because you're going to forget some of it and drop some of it and wear some of it out no no no no no no saints the devil's fooling us if we think we've got to keep up with this rat race amen come on it's fooling us i got to have this i've got to have this look i'm guilty come on any of you that felt like i just kind of drilled on you i just look up here i'm lifting my hands i'm guilty i'm guilty well i'd like a little nicer of this but you don't even use this but i would like a nicer version of this to park in my garage or driveway or whatever so that i could look at it and somehow feel good about this that i don't use if we applied that to our bibles we'd all have a gold-plated bible but they that wait upon the lord come on i want to go back to this example if i can but they that will just stop and let him gird them just wait just wait he's tailor fitting his word to our life because he said i said i will never leave you nor forsake you i said that this work i began in you i will finish so therefore i've got to tailor the word perfectly for your life don't have no generic version of the gospel do you know that people are like oh just say the sinner's prayer with them anybody can say the sinner's prayer introduce them to jesus christ they that wait upon the lord shall renew their strength they shall mount up with wings as eagles what does that say right there [Music] they shall run and not be weary what does that take super natural strength there it is saints poured right down in our life the promised word that we will run and not be weary we shall walk is it okay that i leave it that way we shall walk saints of grace tabernacle believers of this this hour right here we shall walk and not faint when you start to feel faint just start declaring i've been given a supernatural strength it's been poured out upon me it's promised of god and i'm not going to falter in this hour because i have all the strength is available to me i just have to wait on the lord and he is going to renew my strength to stand you know there's a song that says you know in some weak hour my brother and sister we all face a weak hour but let's just remember we can call on the lord right that was what we read earlier call on the lord david said a call on the lord don't let satan steal that from you but i'm not worthy to call on the lord call on the lord amen and he will pour his strength into you hallelujah love you tonight hopefully i made sense amen let's just stand and sing a song or two
