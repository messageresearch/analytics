[27:33] [Music]
[27:38] is that it okay well you know
[27:41] you have to you guys have to just
[27:44] realize that brother paul's reaching an
[27:46] age there's other clouds floating along

[27:52] little word comes in
[27:53] mind and i'm sure i know what song
[27:55] that's and then you all look at me
[27:56] blankly
[27:58] so yeah this is it i
[28:01] just feel like something good is about
[28:04] to happen
[28:07] i just feel like something good is
[28:10] on its way he has promised
[28:14] that he'd
[28:17] [Music]
[28:28] jesus
[28:30] [Music]

[28:56] its way

[29:09] i have happened
[29:14] [Music]
[29:24] investment
[29:32] well of course we should be singing the
[29:34] verse hallelujah
[29:36] well i think i got my message across
[29:39] hallelujah
[29:40] i want to speak to you tonight on part
[29:43] two
[29:44] of something good is happening amen
[29:47] we're not looking
[29:48] for it to happen but it is
[29:51] happening can someone say thank you lord
[29:55] hallelujah amen my subject would be
[29:59] remember
[30:00] that we are only what we are by the
[30:02] grace of god
[30:04] and we'll take that just right out of
[30:07] thought tonight if we just stand
[30:09] i just want to share with you there were
[30:11] those in the church
[30:13] that were inquiring of one of the prayer
[30:15] requests that we had
[30:16] off of the mission site and brother
[30:19] tommy mckinstry
[30:21] i'm not sure exactly what city in great
[30:23] britain that he is
[30:24] in but uh we had prayer requests for his
[30:27] dad
[30:28] brother william mckinstry and uh
[30:31] so we followed through with that uh
[30:33] brother tommy was just very thrilled
[30:36] that someone was actually you know had
[30:39] remembered
[30:40] and his his dad is in a difficult
[30:43] situation
[30:44] just getting weaker every day as this
[30:46] cancer is afflicting him
[30:48] and brother tommy said that he himself
[30:51] and his dad brother william uh
[30:54] definitely appreciate
[30:55] your prayers a very difficult time for
[30:58] their family
[30:59] and uh brother william has been a real
[31:02] mainstay
[31:03] in the church and so they would just
[31:05] desire
[31:06] you continue to pray and i don't know if
[31:09] i'm supposed to share this or not
[31:12] but um i want you to see the humor of
[31:14] this
[31:15] about maybe i don't know i have to look
[31:17] at my phone again i don't want to
[31:18] exaggerate but maybe let's say
[31:21] 12 30 this morning my phone went ding
[31:24] and brother prashant's like glory to god
[31:27] we're coming to visit
[31:31] and so i say glory to god they're coming
[31:34] to visit
[31:35] so just pray for them i believe they're
[31:37] planning on being here this coming
[31:38] weekend and maybe even
[31:40] staying into this next week the way i
[31:42] understood it
[31:44] uh so let's just pray god give them
[31:45] traveling mercies i
[31:47] know they're excited and i know that you
[31:49] all love
[31:50] uh brother persona and sister akoncha
[31:52] just as much as jerry and i do so
[31:54] a little homecoming amen you know
[31:58] prayer changes things and it also
[32:01] changes addresses
[32:02] i hate men you know just saying just
[32:05] saying
[32:06] and uh so we want to remember them amen
[32:10] and you know as the lord just moved upon
[32:12] our sister
[32:13] concha you know just a difficult time
[32:16] uh you know to those that have had i
[32:19] know brother adam has had
[32:21] you know some back issues before and it
[32:24] can be
[32:24] uh debilitating it can just stop you you
[32:27] can't
[32:28] really do anything so let's just
[32:31] remember them sister concha and we're
[32:33] claiming an
[32:34] absolute complete healing amen
[32:38] galatians the sixth chapter
[32:43] we want to go through these 10 verses
[32:47] take a little thought nothing real deep
[32:49] tonight saints i
[32:51] i hope that's all right but just to take
[32:53] a little stroll
[32:55] through the bible is always a lovely
[32:59] thing
[32:59] and to learn the lessons amen and take
[33:03] them to heart
[33:05] to realize that if we took
[33:09] i know this is going to sound awkward to
[33:10] you but if we took all revelation
[33:13] out of the bible
[33:17] and we just simply read it we would
[33:20] still be blessed
[33:22] there is all of these words of wisdom
[33:26] that are just laid out there that we can
[33:29] look at that
[33:31] let's just start with verse one for an
[33:32] example brethren
[33:35] if a man be overtaken in a fault
[33:39] does that ever happen yeah we don't need
[33:43] revelation to figure out that happens
[33:46] ye which are spiritual
[33:49] restore such a one in the spirit of
[33:51] meekness
[33:52] now i don't know maybe we're tainted
[33:54] because we do have revelation of the
[33:56] word but i look at this and it seems to
[33:57] me very cut and dry
[33:59] if a man believes he's spiritual and you
[34:01] see a brother overtaken in a fault
[34:04] what you should do is start out set in
[34:06] order to restore
[34:08] that brother not get in a hurry to see
[34:11] how fast we can kick him out of the
[34:12] church
[34:13] lest it would taint our reputation
[34:20] but to pull them in and let the
[34:21] preaching the washing of the water of
[34:23] the word deal with them and
[34:25] and do that and we're all guilty
[34:26] sometimes of not doing our part and
[34:28] god's been dealing with me on
[34:30] a couple little things i won't go into
[34:32] tonight but we know that that god is in
[34:35] control
[34:36] amen bear ye one another's burdens but
[34:41] brother paul and brother paul speaking
[34:43] to you i've got so
[34:45] many things on my plate
[34:49] there's just no room to bear someone
[34:51] else's burden
[34:53] i know that sounds selfish but i want
[34:55] you to understand i just have so much
[34:57] going on in my life
[34:58] i simply don't have time for you
[35:02] but that's not what the word said the
[35:05] word in
[35:06] very simple terms doesn't say when you
[35:08] can explain
[35:10] all of these things in all of these
[35:11] revelations and you can
[35:13] no it just simply tells us bear one
[35:17] another's burdens
[35:18] and so fulfill the law of christ for if
[35:21] a man think himself to be something
[35:24] when he is nothing now isn't that funny
[35:27] because
[35:28] when you think you're something there's
[35:31] no
[35:31] realization that you are nothing
[35:34] you are convinced this ship doesn't sail
[35:37] without me
[35:39] right and that's the anointing that
[35:41] comes with it we're so important
[35:44] this church couldn't function without
[35:46] paul
[35:49] but the scripture just said
[35:52] when he thinks he's something when he's
[35:54] nothing he deceiveth
[35:56] himself and i've repeated this phrase
[35:59] many times here in the church the
[36:00] greatest fool is a fool who fools
[36:02] himself
[36:04] you see if we get to the place we feel
[36:06] like we
[36:08] are it or we have the answer but let
[36:11] every man prove his own work
[36:14] and then shall he have rejoicing in
[36:16] himself alone and not in another
[36:18] for every man shall bear his own burden
[36:21] let him that is
[36:22] taught in the word communicate unto him
[36:25] that teacheth
[36:26] in all good things be not deceived god
[36:30] is
[36:30] not mocked for whatsoever a man soweth
[36:34] that shall he also reap for he that
[36:37] soweth
[36:37] to his flesh shall of the flesh reap
[36:41] corruption
[36:42] but and i want you this this verse 8 i
[36:45] want you to
[36:46] take this because we will tie this into
[36:48] a quote here in just a little bit
[36:51] he that soweth to his flesh shall of the
[36:53] flesh reap corruption but he that soweth
[36:55] to the spirit shall of the spirit
[36:57] reap life everlasting and let us not be
[37:01] weary in
[37:01] well-doing now saints i'm just i'll let
[37:05] you be seated in just a moment but i
[37:06] just want to drive this home
[37:08] i have suffered
[37:11] from that right there lord i have done
[37:15] all i can do i can't take another step i
[37:18] can't do another thing
[37:21] become weary but the problem was saints
[37:24] is we were trying to do it in our own
[37:26] flesh
[37:28] and not under the anointing of the holy
[37:30] ghost
[37:31] do you know how hard it is i have done
[37:33] it can we have a little confession time
[37:35] kill the cameras kill the sound
[37:37] i have come to this pulpit
[37:41] in great travail in times of my life
[37:44] and i have mechanically preached to you
[37:49] you probably could remember the times
[37:51] it'd be like
[37:53] i think that's dead on arrival
[37:58] but you see sometimes we can be in such
[38:00] great travail in our life
[38:04] that we have just become so weary that
[38:07] we just
[38:08] feel like it's all for naught and the
[38:11] devil's
[38:11] over here in the shadows licking his
[38:15] chops all i gotta do is hit this
[38:18] brother hit this sister one more time
[38:22] and i've got him finished but i want you
[38:24] to know how wonderful it is what god
[38:27] thinks of you and i
[38:28] that in the meantime while satan is
[38:30] winding up
[38:32] to get that lick on you god comes down
[38:34] and
[38:35] your bible might be laying there and
[38:36] some inspires you and you open it up
[38:40] and you go
[38:45] he that is in me
[38:48] is greater than he that is in this world
[38:52] and something breaks loose and
[38:55] flows through you and satan comes to
[38:57] knock you out
[38:58] and you're there get behind me he's like
[39:01] whoa this is not the guy i was dealing
[39:02] with this is not the
[39:03] the gal i was dealing with a few minutes
[39:05] ago what happened
[39:08] well i'll tell you what happened i got a
[39:09] father you've got a father he loves you
[39:12] so much a bridegroom however you want to
[39:14] put the terminology
[39:16] that loves you so much
[39:19] hallelujah for in due season we shall
[39:22] reap
[39:22] if we faint not as we have therefore
[39:25] opportunity let us do good
[39:27] unto all men especially unto them who
[39:29] are of the household
[39:30] of faith you may be seated heavenly
[39:33] father bless this time this word we pray
[39:36] in your precious name
[39:37] amen
[39:41] you know as we look through these
[39:42] scriptures i want to bring out just a
[39:45] couple points before we move on
[39:47] verse four if we could go back to that
[39:49] brother alex
[39:50] uh we'll look at this and i want to just
[39:53] drive home a little point my brother and
[39:55] sister
[39:56] that i find this is something that come
[39:59] from my childhood
[40:00] something that i saw and i still see and
[40:04] and that would be that people get so
[40:06] engrossed
[40:07] in what someone else would do it might
[40:09] be a pastor it might be
[40:10] a ministry it might be a individual
[40:14] and they're constantly talking about
[40:16] well you know one brother
[40:17] brother so and so and brother so-and-so
[40:19] or sister so-and-so or that family
[40:22] uh god sure answers their prayer they're
[40:24] sure doing things and
[40:26] they're this and they're that but the
[40:28] word right here
[40:29] tells us that we should come to a place
[40:32] that we prove
[40:33] our own work now when we take this if
[40:37] you take this in a carnal forefront
[40:39] you would say well okay i guess we go
[40:41] out and prove what we are
[40:43] but it's not us it's christ in us
[40:46] so we have to make sure that we have the
[40:47] correct context but we look at this see
[40:50] what we have to do is prove that the
[40:52] same god
[40:53] that come down with william branham
[40:55] according to the word of god is the same
[40:58] god that's here tonight
[40:59] it's the same god that is resident in
[41:01] your house
[41:03] resident in your soul amen we don't
[41:06] have to my brother and sister i know
[41:08] i've been accused had some people just
[41:10] very much chew me up
[41:11] that i i'm down on the prophet and i
[41:14] must be some kind of secret unbeliever
[41:16] no i'm sorry i sit and i read things in
[41:19] my chair
[41:20] oftentimes my the families doing their
[41:22] own thing i sit right there and read
[41:24] things in the message
[41:26] in the word of god and i cry like a baby
[41:29] to think the sacrifice that was made to
[41:32] bring the word to me
[41:35] i am not callous to what god called
[41:38] brother branham to do
[41:40] but i know my brother and sister that
[41:42] the word that was brought i had this
[41:44] brought up to me the other day what is
[41:45] the vindication of brother branham's
[41:47] ministry and once again my brother and
[41:50] sister
[41:50] the vindication to paul amen this is
[41:53] spelled
[41:54] op oh wait maybe i shouldn't have
[41:56] started to do that
[41:57] o p i n i
[42:00] o n that's it i got it
[42:04] this is opinion okay i want to present
[42:07] it to you
[42:08] opinion i look to what god used brother
[42:10] branham signs and wonders uh
[42:12] demons cast out healings and all of this
[42:15] thing
[42:16] but to paul haley the real vindication
[42:19] of this
[42:20] message is the fact it is producing in
[42:23] the year
[42:24] 2021 exactly what it was supposed to
[42:27] produce
[42:29] amen it wasn't a flash in the pan it
[42:31] wasn't some people that are all going to
[42:33] go back to their denomination
[42:35] and just you know run around in their
[42:37] and their tank tops and their
[42:39] surfer shorts and blah blah blah my
[42:41] brother and sister this word
[42:43] is producing a bride to jesus christ
[42:46] amen that's what means something to paul
[42:49] now i hope that doesn't offend anybody
[42:51] my brother and sister
[42:52] i've got to visit with people that were
[42:55] there
[42:55] in the meetings amen sister sarah's
[42:58] parents say they have personal testimony
[43:00] of what they got to see and it is
[43:02] supernatural but my brother and sister i
[43:05] have to have a revelation that the god
[43:06] that was there is the god that is here
[43:08] with me right now
[43:10] and so i'm not looking back into history
[43:12] to say well god was there
[43:14] in a certain year in a certain place to
[43:16] be able to stand with confidence and say
[43:18] god
[43:19] is here tonight with our young people he
[43:22] is here
[43:22] tonight with our needs for health he's
[43:25] here tonight for deliverance of spirits
[43:28] he's here tonight for blessings on the
[43:30] bride of christ
[43:32] so let us prove our own work my brother
[43:35] and sister that we can stand with a
[43:36] confidence
[43:37] before a world that would judge you
[43:39] harshly
[43:41] and say you know what you can't convince
[43:43] me any different i'm sorry
[43:44] i met god on the backside of my desert i
[43:47] didn't go to arabia but i went to the
[43:49] backside of my desert
[43:50] i met god and god is real so you can
[43:53] tell me this is all nonsense you can
[43:55] tell me this is all just a hoax
[43:56] you can do all of that but i can tell
[43:58] you you're wasting your breath
[44:00] amen because it becomes a very personal
[44:04] thing
[44:04] here because we have proven what god
[44:07] spoke
[44:08] to us see what he spoke to brother
[44:11] trevor sister kerry
[44:12] uh brother jason sister emmy sister
[44:14] sarah you know uh brother chris brother
[44:16] sergey whoever it might be
[44:18] what god dealt with you and guided you
[44:20] is not the same exact footstep he called
[44:23] me
[44:24] into and or you didn't come to walk in
[44:26] the same exact footstep
[44:28] so i have to not have cookie cutter
[44:30] proof
[44:32] this is a problem we have saints cookie
[44:34] cutter proof everybody's pointing to the
[44:36] same thing
[44:37] saying in vindicated vindicated and this
[44:40] is the example that they lift up
[44:42] i'm good with that on one side but i
[44:44] want to know where
[44:45] you're at i want to know what god did
[44:48] for you
[44:49] and is it real enough to stand the test
[44:51] of time
[44:52] and the fire
[44:57] because you ain't seen nothing yet
[45:04] amen i don't mean that bad
[45:08] so we look at this and realize that god
[45:11] has proven his word to you and i
[45:15] now as we are proving this word it
[45:18] brings us to the place that we
[45:20] are called now to bear one another's
[45:23] burdens
[45:25] but let's bring a little reconciliation
[45:27] to the word here
[45:29] you see we can't take
[45:32] our burden
[45:36] and come along and say you know if this
[45:38] church had prayed for me
[45:39] i wouldn't have backslid first off i
[45:43] don't know who prays for who
[45:45] and how long right i never want to sound
[45:48] boastful but
[45:48] i had a horrible night last night i woke
[45:51] up at 1 38
[45:52] i could not go back to sleep i literally
[45:54] i told sister jerry when i woke up
[45:56] i i leaned over out of bed because the
[45:59] phone is actually on the floor and
[46:01] i was sure it was going to say it was
[46:02] you know 5 45 or 6 o'clock
[46:05] i was actually shocked when it said 138
[46:08] i was like
[46:08] what in the world am i awake for and i
[46:11] laid there and i laid there and i laid
[46:12] there
[46:13] and then the power went wrap and quit
[46:17] altogether
[46:18] i have to share this to you i hope you
[46:20] don't mind a little humor
[46:22] so it woke sister jerry up and jerry's
[46:25] like well okay we better call idaho
[46:26] power make sure the powers
[46:28] they know that the power's out which
[46:30] they didn't i kind of thought they
[46:31] probably would
[46:32] we're walking through the house in the
[46:36] pitch black
[46:38] and i stepped on our teddy dogs squeaky
[46:41] toy
[46:44] and i just about had a heart attack
[46:47] it was like i'm like
[46:51] [Music]
[46:54] needless to say i had no need to go back
[46:56] to sleep for a long time
[47:01] that was that was caffeine i was i was
[47:03] an adrenaline caffeine
[47:05] mega shot but you see my brother and
[47:08] sister i can't come along and say you
[47:10] know i'm struggling in life
[47:11] and i'm not talking spiritually i'm
[47:13] talking about in a sense just having a
[47:14] hard time
[47:15] sleeping i do desire your prayers but
[47:17] it's all your fault
[47:21] no you see the words telling us
[47:24] i have to carry my burden to the altar
[47:28] i can't hand it to brother david and say
[47:29] brother david will you take my burdens
[47:31] to the altar because i just can't do it
[47:35] but do we share that we share that we
[47:38] help we pray we ought to now let's not
[47:41] turn into psychologists where we all are
[47:43] looking
[47:44] um sister gabriella there really appears
[47:47] to be
[47:48] something wrong i
[47:51] oh i know what it is you're left-handed
[47:56] i'm sorry i have an affinity for
[47:59] left-handed people
[48:00] i've got a wife i've got a son amen
[48:04] got a granddaughter look at this
[48:07] you see we should be in tune enough
[48:10] saints with one another
[48:12] when you see one with a burden
[48:16] lord help us no we don't have to do it
[48:20] physically
[48:21] and we don't even have to do it verbally
[48:23] in fact we're probably better off if we
[48:25] don't if we just go over and say you
[48:26] know what i'm going to help them carry
[48:27] their burden
[48:29] but then again we can't just dump our
[48:31] burden off and say you know i'm backslid
[48:32] now because nobody prayed for me you
[48:34] don't have a clue whether somebody
[48:35] prayed or not
[48:36] remember we have to get up and walk
[48:38] across the red sea on our own
[48:40] hallelujah i don't i remember seeing a
[48:42] cartoon once
[48:43] where it's it said something on the
[48:45] order of fred was re
[48:46] fred was afraid of water fred was
[48:48] reluctant to cross the red sea
[48:50] and it shows two guys dragging him and
[48:52] there's tracks from his heels
[48:54] going down through the red sea god's not
[48:56] going to do that saints we got to get up
[48:58] and say you know what
[48:59] i'm going to make it i'm going to go i'm
[49:00] going gonna press into this
[49:02] but when you look over and you see
[49:04] someone that would express to you i'm
[49:05] praying for you and i love you
[49:07] and we're gonna make it together my
[49:09] brother and sister it does something to
[49:11] avoid
[49:12] the the spirit of a man of a human amen
[49:15] and so we
[49:16] we look at this and realize that we have
[49:18] to
[49:19] uh uh carry our own burden amen
[49:22] we can't just throw it down and give it
[49:24] to the pastor and say it's his problem
[49:26] or give it to somebody else
[49:27] or give it to church as it were you have
[49:30] to bring your own burden to the lord
[49:32] but you have to come and look around you
[49:35] also
[49:35] and my brother and sister sometimes our
[49:37] trials that we are
[49:38] so under pressure uh we are sitting
[49:41] there so under pressure
[49:43] it's not about the trial at all god's
[49:45] testing you to see
[49:46] what you will do with that trial amen
[49:49] what will be the word
[49:51] test that you have in the time of
[49:54] that trial will we stop and say well god
[49:57] must not
[49:58] love me because this wouldn't be
[49:59] happening maybe god loves you
[50:01] so much more than you are able to fathom
[50:04] and he said there's a little defect a
[50:07] little something there
[50:08] that you need to get rid of and so god
[50:11] just loves you
[50:12] so much contrary to our human nature we
[50:14] as parents we love our children so much
[50:17] that we'll tell them 35 times don't do
[50:19] that
[50:20] and we call it love well i tell you what
[50:23] i've raised three kids that turned out
[50:25] somewhat normal
[50:26] amen for the presence of those that are
[50:29] here very normal
[50:31] but my brother and sister real love
[50:35] the word of god says is corrective
[50:38] it's not passive it's not padding it's
[50:41] not manipulative
[50:43] it's corrective and so
[50:46] if we really love then we will make sure
[50:49] that we approach it correctly ourself
[50:51] and we apply
[50:52] the correct antidote so that it will
[50:55] produce what love should produce
[50:57] now i want to go into god's chosen place
[51:00] of worship
[51:01] and uh just look at this now this is a
[51:04] prayer
[51:05] that we're starting with right at the
[51:06] start of the service
[51:08] he says our heavenly father as we now
[51:10] humbly approach this great throne of
[51:12] grace
[51:13] by faith we move into the beyonds where
[51:16] god and the angels and the cherubims and
[51:18] all the heavenly hosts is assembled
[51:20] together
[51:21] for he said there cannot be even a
[51:23] sparrow fall to the ground
[51:25] without the heavenly father knowing it
[51:27] how much more
[51:28] does he know when it know here when
[51:31] hundreds of people
[51:32] have their heads bowed and calling upon
[51:35] thee for
[51:36] special requests father look down upon
[51:38] the needy world tonight
[51:40] for we are a needy people and i lift my
[51:43] hand and say
[51:43] i am a needy person and i pray god
[51:47] that because we have assembled here and
[51:49] express
[51:50] to thee our faith in a living god who
[51:53] does
[51:54] answer prayer we have come out
[51:57] from among the world of the
[51:59] uncircumcised
[52:00] of the heart and ears and come out to
[52:02] live a separate
[52:04] life to live in confessing our
[52:07] faith in thee so here
[52:10] is you know what i always refer to as
[52:12] the quantifiers
[52:14] amen my brother and sister we can say
[52:16] well
[52:17] my faith i have a good farmer friend
[52:19] he's a good friend to me
[52:21] he doesn't want to talk about god he
[52:23] doesn't want to talk about church he
[52:24] doesn't want to talk about these things
[52:26] he says my my faith is very
[52:29] very personal and i don't like to
[52:31] discuss it my brother and sister the
[52:33] word of god says if you have faith you
[52:35] confess it to the world
[52:37] amen you you will not be found silent
[52:40] in that day you will not be the silent
[52:43] witness
[52:44] amen so it's there that it's just by
[52:47] singing of songs
[52:48] uh in your own privacy you know if
[52:50] you're kind of uh
[52:52] uh i don't mean it this way as it sounds
[52:54] but if you're kind of a socially awkward
[52:56] person right you
[52:57] you you get kind of bound up to stand up
[52:59] in public or something like that
[53:01] god understands that he made you the way
[53:04] you are you're not
[53:05] backslid because you're shy you're not
[53:07] backslid because your heart bout beats
[53:09] out of your chest when
[53:11] you know they would call upon you for
[53:12] something or the idea of having to get
[53:14] up and sing a song
[53:16] you're not backslid because of that but
[53:18] make sure that satan doesn't
[53:20] use those things to keep your worship
[53:24] silent amen find your way
[53:28] to worship god find your way it might be
[53:31] sisters when you're vacuuming
[53:33] amen to be in there amen did you know
[53:35] that
[53:36] the vacuums all run on the key of f and
[53:39] so
[53:39] you can sing with your vacuum amen in
[53:42] fact there's lovely songs that go
[53:45] uh with with that there's lovely songs
[53:47] that go with the harmonics of an old
[53:48] wore
[53:49] out tractor there's all kinds of things
[53:51] if you have joy in your heart your lips
[53:54] can find a way to worship
[53:57] amen are you with me i'm not just trying
[53:59] to be funny tonight but i'm telling you
[54:01] whatever your circumstance is you know
[54:04] you just like well you know my
[54:05] neighborhood think i'm pretty weird
[54:07] if i'm out screaming in the backyard do
[54:09] it while you mow the yard all they'll

[54:11] is thinking you're asking the wife for
[54:13] lemonade
[54:14] amen they won't know the difference it's
[54:16] fine we're not ashamed of that but just
[54:19] use the opportunity to worship god
[54:22] amen so as you look at this now we
[54:25] realize that god answers prayer i
[54:27] appreciate that brother chris
[54:28] when you come up here and and the very
[54:31] first words you say
[54:32] you know god answers prayer amen amen
[54:35] that's a testimony of what we're talking
[54:37] tonight amen
[54:38] something good is happening a bride is
[54:41] coming to life
[54:43] and she is this final voice to this
[54:46] final age
[54:47] and she will be that voice she won't
[54:50] talk about someday being a
[54:52] voice she will recognize i am the voice
[54:55] now and god has called me to be part of
[54:58] that voice
[54:59] oh hallelujah i love that i appreciate
[55:02] that
[55:02] amen you know i got a lot of farmer
[55:04] friends that are all kind of
[55:06] some of them a little bit mocking you

[55:09] and the other and you know what i've
[55:11] done i just i'm not going to be offended
[55:13] by it i just refuse to be offended
[55:16] so i've turned it around and here
[55:17] recently one of them said something

[55:49] hallelujah amen so you see
[55:53] we're uh to live to live a separate life
[55:56] and to live in confessing our faith in
[55:58] thee i love this prayer amen that's why
[56:00] we're
[56:01] we're reading it tonight we've raised
[56:04] our hands
[56:05] saying we are needy dear god answer
[56:08] every one of their requests and then
[56:10] father we pray that you'll visit us
[56:12] tonight
[56:13] in the word we come here for correction
[56:16] i hope we can say amen for that for
[56:18] understanding right which is another
[56:21] more
[56:22] subtle or toned down word for revelation
[56:26] that we might know just how to live in
[56:28] this present day
[56:30] now let me throw this back in times past
[56:32] we had people my brother and sister when
[56:34] i was a child
[56:36] the little town of greenleaf became very
[56:38] anti-message
[56:39] very fast because people had no wisdom
[56:43] on how to deal with the people in the
[56:46] community
[56:47] and so people would walk up to the clerk
[56:49] in the little green leaf store
[56:51] and they would just tell them you know
[56:52] what you have to believe what we believe
[56:54] or you're going to hell
[56:56] now here's somebody who's been faithful
[56:58] in church their whole life
[56:59] they don't know any different now
[57:01] somebody's told them you have to stand
[57:02] where i'm at or you're going to hell
[57:04] see no wisdom no knowledge in the lord
[57:08] on how to approach that
[57:10] they would have been much better off
[57:11] sister and sister as it were man to man
[57:14] would have been much better off to have
[57:16] stood there and become
[57:17] their friend oh you have three children
[57:21] how old are they what do you guys like
[57:24] to do
[57:25] do you oh you have a garden you this and
[57:28] become a friend
[57:29] and at some point in time when you hear
[57:31] the door opening
[57:33] you can talk about these things of god
[57:36] and i'll tell you what it does if they
[57:37] never open the door you've got a friend
[57:40] and the scriptures make says make
[57:42] friends of those of the mammon
[57:45] that's not to go rub elbows and
[57:47] socialize and stay up till midnight in
[57:49] their backyard when they're doing
[57:50] whatever they do at midnight in their
[57:52] backyard

[1:01:59] standing on the edge of the platform

[1:02:12] about someone that got healed
[1:02:14] at communion time my brother and sister

[1:02:25] that that was true and it come and i
[1:02:28] received it

[1:02:59] fill every believer
[1:03:01] with the holy spirit now my brother and
[1:03:03] sister i'm going to just inject this i
[1:03:04] hope you don't mind as i get older and
[1:03:06] bolder
[1:03:07] but we got young people in our church
[1:03:08] that haven't been baptized they haven't
[1:03:10] uh fully submitted to the lord and i'm

[1:03:15] going to tell you that something's wrong
[1:03:17] with you if you don't do this
[1:03:18] but i am going to believe and i hope you
[1:03:21] don't mind if i confess right to your
[1:03:23] face
[1:03:23] then i believe god is going to come and
[1:03:25] touch lives of our young people
[1:03:28] and have them in a place where they
[1:03:30] recognize that god came for them
[1:03:32] amen our lord jesus died for them amen
[1:03:35] and that you can reach out and take a
[1:03:37] holds of that
[1:03:39] and then as it were pull the trigger and
[1:03:41] say you know what i'm going to give my
[1:03:42] heart to the lord
[1:03:43] i'm going to start right here as a child
[1:03:45] i don't need a bunch of scars i don't
[1:03:47] need
[1:03:48] a bunch of calluses there's a phrase
[1:03:50] where people say well
[1:03:51] they're out there doing that they're
[1:03:52] working on their testimony well i'm
[1:03:54] telling you there's some young people
[1:03:56] right inside the walls of the church
[1:03:58] that are working on their testimony that
[1:04:00] if the lord tarries they'll stand
[1:04:02] 5 10 15 20 years from now and say the
[1:04:05] lord has held me all the days of my life
[1:04:08] i did not have to go out into this slum
[1:04:11] that they call laodicea i didn't have to
[1:04:14] get marred with the muck of this world
[1:04:16] but god in his keeping power come and
[1:04:19] fill me with the holy ghost
[1:04:20] and i trust him and i give my life to
[1:04:22] him that's what i call working on a
[1:04:25] testimony
[1:04:26] hallelujah but sometimes you take
[1:04:28] somebody like brother paul talking about
[1:04:30] how he backslid and how he went out in
[1:04:32] the world
[1:04:32] and it turns stirs the heart strings and
[1:04:35] people are like oh it's so beautiful
[1:04:36] brother paul come back
[1:04:38] i'll tell you what i'd like to have i'd
[1:04:39] like to have a revelation and never left
[1:04:41] in the beginning
[1:04:43] that's what i really would have liked
[1:04:45] amen i didn't need to go out there and
[1:04:47] work on some testimony i would have
[1:04:48] liked to been like you young people
[1:04:50] and be able to stand one day and say you
[1:04:52] know what i've been in the house of the
[1:04:54] lord all my life

[1:05:16] believing children grant these things

[1:05:20] because you told us to ask ask abundance
[1:05:23] ask for great things many of them
[1:05:25] that our joys might be made full and we
[1:05:28] ask them in jesus christ's name
[1:05:30] amen when i was studying and i read this
[1:05:33] prayer
[1:05:34] it stirred my heart i i'd have to say it
[1:05:37] just melted it i was just like lord
[1:05:39] that there it is just uh i believe that
[1:05:41] would be the prayer of every pastor

[1:05:47] here and
[1:05:47] and just move father a healing of the
[1:05:50] body is wonderful
[1:05:52] you know just uh reading you know
[1:05:54] brother branham talking about
[1:05:56] howdy right you know she could have just
[1:05:58] asked for the healing of her sister
[1:06:00] and people would have said isn't that so
[1:06:01] wonderful he had that opportunity to ask
[1:06:04] a blessing of god and now her sister is
[1:06:06] no longer a
[1:06:07] but you see my brother and sister you
[1:06:08] can be filled with the holy ghost and be
[1:06:10] a
[1:06:11] amen but you can be the perfect athlete
[1:06:14] the olympic athlete

[1:06:22] thing
[1:06:23] thank the lord for that amen now look at
[1:06:26] this we want to go on into a total
[1:06:28] deliverance
[1:06:29] hope you guys don't mind just had a few
[1:06:30] quotes it's kind of the way my
[1:06:32] thoughts went now brother brown i'm
[1:06:34] talking in a total deliverance he said
[1:06:37] if our hearts condemn us
[1:06:40] go back and go back into these sermons
[1:06:43] right
[1:06:43] we just have a moment just to reach in
[1:06:45] and pull a little chunk out
[1:06:49] if our heart condemns us comma
[1:06:52] pause we want complete deliverance
[1:06:58] amen if your heart condemns you don't
[1:07:01] run away
[1:07:03] amen don't don't don't flee
[1:07:07] run to the cross
[1:07:10] we don't want to be a halfway church
[1:07:13] isn't that right grace
[1:07:15] we want to be a real church or no church
[1:07:18] at all
[1:07:19] we want to be real christians or no
[1:07:21] christians at all
[1:07:23] we want total deliverance from our
[1:07:25] habits from our sin from our evil
[1:07:27] thinking
[1:07:28] from our evil doing from our negligence
[1:07:31] whoa look what he threw right in the
[1:07:33] line with the guy that might be corrupt
[1:07:37] negligence oh but what did he say
[1:07:41] iniquity those knowing to do it
[1:07:45] and not doing it to them it
[1:07:48] is sin and so
[1:07:52] is evil thinking and evil doing whatever
[1:07:56] we've done
[1:07:57] we want total deliverance so that when
[1:07:59] the people come into
[1:08:00] this church can we read this present
[1:08:02] tense when people come
[1:08:04] into this church to be prayed for
[1:08:08] there will be just this little group now
[1:08:10] i i don't know about these numbers here
[1:08:12] i'm pretty happy where we're at but
[1:08:14] maybe not over a hundred or two sitting
[1:08:16] here but they'll be completely
[1:08:18] in the hands of god now saints i'm not
[1:08:22] trying to force you to be interactive
[1:08:23] with me
[1:08:24] tonight but don't we want to be that
[1:08:25] kind of church that is
[1:08:27] regardless of the number just completely
[1:08:29] in the hands of god
[1:08:31] amen just so completely committed to god
[1:08:34] that god says i know i can trust
[1:08:36] this group of believers because they're
[1:08:39] speaking from their heart
[1:08:41] and they back it up with their life and
[1:08:43] they believe the word and they say amen
[1:08:45] to the word
[1:08:46] and the word is them amen
[1:08:50] and when we pray and god will hear from
[1:08:53] heaven
[1:08:56] god wants somebody that he can hold in
[1:08:58] his hands
[1:08:59] somebody that he can say i got
[1:09:01] confidence in
[1:09:02] and i can send this my sick servant to
[1:09:05] the branham tabernacle to grace
[1:09:07] tabernacle
[1:09:08] at jeffersonville at nampa and that
[1:09:11] group of people are
[1:09:13] one accord
[1:09:17] you realize saints i don't think there's
[1:09:18] a disunity in our church so don't
[1:09:20] anybody get let that spirit come
[1:09:22] but you see over and over again if you
[1:09:24] go study the message brother branham's
[1:09:26] talking about how
[1:09:27] there has to be a one accord there has
[1:09:30] to be a
[1:09:31] unity we can't have somebody over here
[1:09:34] spewing out
[1:09:35] venom and it be you know okay we'll just
[1:09:39] uh we'll
[1:09:40] like a sliver you know we'll just
[1:09:41] encapsulate that
[1:09:44] oh i shouldn't even even bring this up
[1:09:46] but saints that's why sometime back here
[1:09:48] brother paul
[1:09:49] seemed like a rabid dog
[1:09:53] because you see if we leave that spirit
[1:09:57] sitting in the sanctuary
[1:10:03] then we'll wonder why god's not moving
[1:10:05] in our midst
[1:10:07] we'll wonder why our kids hey look i'm
[1:10:09] telling you the truth these things
[1:10:11] happen
[1:10:12] be right in a message church in the
[1:10:13] deacons busting kids playing video games
[1:10:16] on their phones
[1:10:18] i don't want that i want the power of
[1:10:21] god i want the holy spirit here
[1:10:23] when our kids come to church they come
[1:10:25] to church because they know god is real
[1:10:28] and they want to grow up and live up to
[1:10:30] that expectation because
[1:10:31] mama lives up to it and daddy lives up
[1:10:34] to it and the deacon lives up to it
[1:10:36] and their best friends live up to it and
[1:10:38] their best friends parents live up to it
[1:10:40] and the pastor lives up to it and the
[1:10:43] ministers live
[1:10:44] up to it and they can look out and say
[1:10:46] that's not fake
[1:10:47] that's real amen but remember
[1:10:51] no amount of words
[1:10:54] will overcome our actions
[1:10:59] brother brown says i don't say a lot at
[1:11:01] funerals
[1:11:05] because they already saw
[1:11:09] their actions
[1:11:13] no i'm not talking about church tonight
[1:11:14] that's not the funeral he's talking
[1:11:16] about
[1:11:18] but you see it's important saints now
[1:11:20] this
[1:11:21] i'm just turning the heat up now you're
[1:11:23] not frogs but i'm just going to turn the
[1:11:25] heat up okay is that all right
[1:11:27] amen so the people and that group of
[1:11:30] people
[1:11:31] are one accord what is the final words
[1:11:33] there
[1:11:35] something will
[1:11:39] happen we don't have to sit there and
[1:11:42] hope our kids will get saved
[1:11:43] i hope so and so will get delivered hope
[1:11:46] god will come on the scene for someone
[1:11:48] who's sick
[1:11:48] when we can come into these positions
[1:11:51] that lines up with god's word
[1:11:53] something will happen i say lord i want
[1:11:56] to be part of the catalyst that makes
[1:11:58] something happen
[1:11:59] i want to be part of that moving of the
[1:12:02] holy spirit
[1:12:03] i don't want to be the boat anchor
[1:12:06] hallelujah amen i don't want to be the
[1:12:09] boat anchor
[1:12:11] you know saints uh there's a little bit
[1:12:12] humorous but i'll just tell you to make
[1:12:14] the point
[1:12:14] i saw a video one time this is i think
[1:12:17] lake of the ozarks
[1:12:18] and these guys are going up the that's a
[1:12:20] huge lake down there in arkansas
[1:12:22] and they're they're going up the lake in
[1:12:23] their boat and they look over and
[1:12:25] they're gaining on this other boat
[1:12:27] uh pretty fast and as they get up beside
[1:12:29] of it
[1:12:30] that all of a sudden you know the one
[1:12:32] guy turns his camera
[1:12:33] and you hear words and some of the words
[1:12:35] aren't the kindest but
[1:12:36] they're like look at these people look
[1:12:38] at these people look at that look at
[1:12:39] that and they edged their boat over
[1:12:41] and here's a boat going up the lake with
[1:12:42] the trailer still attached
[1:12:52] wow praise the lord god come and moved
[1:12:56] in our midst
[1:12:59] now i'm pointing at mtp
[1:13:02] but there was a brother sister child
[1:13:04] teenager
[1:13:06] whatever with their trailer still
[1:13:08] attached
[1:13:10] and we wonder why god won't move in our
[1:13:11] midst
[1:13:13] come on saints are you with me see we've
[1:13:16] got to get to the place god intended us
[1:13:18] to be
[1:13:19] in and i'm not saying we're not headed
[1:13:21] there right because i want you to go
[1:13:22] back to my title
[1:13:23] something good is happening amen i'm not
[1:13:26] speaking down on you tonight i'm
[1:13:28] actually speaking up to you
[1:13:29] hallelujah something good is happening
[1:13:31] why because we are becoming the word and
[1:13:33] the word is becoming us
[1:13:34] and we are manifesting the very thing
[1:13:36] god said i will do
[1:13:38] in this laodicean time at the closing of
[1:13:41] the book
[1:13:41] uh there's going to be a people that
[1:13:44] will bring the rest of the bible
[1:13:46] to culmination and that they without us
[1:13:50] whoa hallelujah that ought to get
[1:13:52] somebody excited
[1:13:53] they without us cannot be made perfect
[1:13:56] oh god i want to help them be perfect oh
[1:14:00] but i need to be perfect in the word
[1:14:02] first
[1:14:02] amen oh hold this do that move that
[1:14:06] look i asked you to do that five minutes
[1:14:08] ago and

[1:14:14] seconds ago
[1:14:20] lord give me patience right now
[1:14:25] come on saints god's working on us and
[1:14:28] we should be so
[1:14:30] happy we should look at this and say
[1:14:33] thank you lord that i'm not who
[1:14:36] i used to be because you are bringing
[1:14:39] this word to pass
[1:14:41] in me oh hallelujah
[1:14:45] oh hallelujah that might not mean
[1:14:49] much to some of you but i'm telling you
[1:14:51] somebody like me means quite a bit
[1:14:54] hallelujah
[1:14:57] well look what he does for us in the
[1:14:59] condition we're in
[1:15:03] now as brother brown's words not ours
[1:15:04] but let me read it again and
[1:15:06] we can highlight that in bright red and
[1:15:08] put an underline on it
[1:15:10] look what he does for us in the
[1:15:11] condition that we're in
[1:15:14] i want you to think about that saints
[1:15:16] i'm going to just rub you a little bit
[1:15:17] raw
[1:15:18] we don't read our bible like we should
[1:15:19] we don't pray like we should we don't
[1:15:21] have the right attitudes and god still
[1:15:23] comes down and shakes heaven and earth
[1:15:25] for you and i
[1:15:26] oh there ought to be hands up saying
[1:15:28] thank you lord
[1:15:30] lord because even in the condition that
[1:15:31] i'm in some days of my life
[1:15:33] stressed out struggling lord and you
[1:15:36] still
[1:15:37] come on the scene
[1:15:40] i'm telling you god loves us more than
[1:15:43] we could even
[1:15:44] ever love ourself
[1:15:48] what would he do if we were one heart
[1:15:52] and one accord the only way we can do
[1:15:55] that is to unify our parts together with
[1:15:57] brotherly love
[1:15:59] obey oh my goodness
[1:16:03] huh let me stop for a moment
[1:16:08] we do believe god sent a prophet right
[1:16:15] is it okay have humor is grace
[1:16:18] tabernacle humored or
[1:16:20] humorless i hope we can have a little
[1:16:23] humor
[1:16:25] because i i don't mean just frivolous
[1:16:26] humor but my brother and sister
[1:16:27] sometimes it's good laugh or cry
[1:16:30] laugh or
[1:16:33] and cry unify unify our hearts together
[1:16:36] with brotherly love
[1:16:38] officers of the church and the pastor
[1:16:41] that we don't have
[1:16:43] or a disobedient pastor because he won't
[1:16:46] preach the true word
[1:16:50] i'm not scanning your hope
[1:16:53] the reason i say these things saints is
[1:16:56] spirits come
[1:16:57] in a certain fashion that can say
[1:17:00] we have unity but what is it with
[1:17:04] that's right we can all agree
[1:17:08] but if we're wrong we're just all wrong
[1:17:14] because 10 wrongs do not make
[1:17:17] a right and this is a prophet's words
[1:17:20] not mine
[1:17:21] amen he said we unify our hearts
[1:17:24] together with brotherly love
[1:17:25] obey the officers of the church in other
[1:17:27] words if the deacon says your kid's
[1:17:29] misbehaving don't fight with him
[1:17:31] that's just a simple simple analogy
[1:17:37] and the pastor because you see honestly
[1:17:40] saints
[1:17:41] sorry about the older bolder thing you
[1:17:43] know i just not that far past my 59th
[1:17:46] birthday here and i just fell off
[1:17:47] another cliff
[1:17:50] if you can't open your heart to hear
[1:17:53] your pastor
[1:17:55] you've got the wrong pastor time
[1:18:00] to put an ad in
[1:18:04] messagepastors.com help wanted
[1:18:08] because you see if you come to church
[1:18:10] and you reject everything that's
[1:18:12] preached to you
[1:18:14] you may as well not come because we're
[1:18:17] well on our way of becoming a
[1:18:19] social structure oh
[1:18:22] and if you need me to find the quotes
[1:18:24] where brother branham preached
[1:18:26] against that then you haven't searched
[1:18:28] the message very hard
[1:18:29] they are abundant where the prophet of
[1:18:31] god hammers that
[1:18:33] over and over and over again they're not
[1:18:35] churches they're lodges
[1:18:38] oh god help us never to go there i'm not
[1:18:41] picking on nobody don't
[1:18:42] misunderstand me i'm not preaching
[1:18:43] against the so and so is down yonder and
[1:18:45] the so-and-so is a thousand miles away
[1:18:46] and the so-and-so is over there i'm not
[1:18:48] i'm preaching to you and i because i
[1:18:50] want you and i
[1:18:51] to mature in this word and not be
[1:18:53] derailed by somebody that
[1:18:55] peddles some sweet smelling stuff
[1:18:58] hallelujah
[1:19:01] officer the church the pastor and the
[1:19:03] pastor obey god see we can't leave that
[1:19:06] out
[1:19:06] then god works through the pastor
[1:19:08] through the board down into the church
[1:19:10] and all together one unit to the kingdom
[1:19:12] of god
[1:19:13] then god will hear when we have a
[1:19:16] unified group
[1:19:18] that's when god hears the saints when we
[1:19:20] have a unified group
[1:19:22] not dysfunctional not one that's why the
[1:19:25] word of god says that he considers an
[1:19:26] abomination a curse
[1:19:28] for someone to so sows discord
[1:19:31] into the body of believers right because
[1:19:34] he's tearing the heart right out of the
[1:19:35] believers
[1:19:37] where no one cares brother and trevor
[1:19:38] going brother trevor going sister kerry
[1:19:40] going through a hard time
[1:19:42] well i remember that they did this and
[1:19:44] this i ain't praying for them
[1:19:49] praise the lord i've got the holy ghost
[1:19:53] i've got some kind of ghost
[1:19:57] wrong spirit
[1:20:01] unified let nothing bother you don't be
[1:20:03] dismayed at anything
[1:20:05] now that's the kind of person that god
[1:20:07] ordained to take the land
[1:20:09] moses was complete he was a man that
[1:20:11] wouldn't compromise
[1:20:13] if there were stews and fusses and so
[1:20:15] forth he wouldn't compromise
[1:20:16] that's what god wants us that's what god
[1:20:19] wants us now
[1:20:20] pharaoh wanted to agree said moses
[1:20:24] you all can go but
[1:20:28] you leave your children behind

[1:21:23] and terrorizing the town and every
[1:21:26] testimony they had down at the
[1:21:28] marketplace god so strong in our church
[1:21:30] was undone by the behavior of their
[1:21:33] children
[1:21:35] and they said oh praise god that's why i
[1:21:37] heard this years ago over and over again

[1:23:08] the jones

[1:23:21] live
[1:23:22] 100 miles away a thousand miles away but
[1:23:25] the best thing you can do
[1:23:27] is get your courage up and go face to
[1:23:30] face
[1:23:31] and just say i don't care who is right
[1:23:34] or wrong
[1:23:35] i don't care we're not even going to
[1:23:37] discuss who offended who or whatever
[1:23:39] you please forgive me
[1:23:42] and you know if you're dealing with a
[1:23:43] real christian they're going to try and
[1:23:45] say well it really wasn't your fault it
[1:23:47] was my fault
[1:23:48] no we're not discussing that we're not
[1:23:50] going back and we're not
[1:23:51] digging up the garden to see who had the
[1:23:53] right we're gonna just say
[1:23:55] i want you to forgive me but you see
[1:23:59] i'm gonna throw this in sister jerry and
[1:24:01] i have practiced that in certain
[1:24:02] circumstances
[1:24:04] and had people look us in the face
[1:24:07] what did you do
[1:24:10] i'm sorry it really is not about it
[1:24:14] i ask you forgive me
[1:24:19] well it's a good deal none of you knew
[1:24:20] me when i was young
[1:24:23] you know communion was a big deal in
[1:24:24] church when i was a kid it'd take two to
[1:24:26] three hours because everybody lined up
[1:24:28] to everybody and said i'm so
[1:24:30] sorry i thought bad thoughts about you
[1:24:33] and it wasn't really done until
[1:24:35] everybody had you know 150 x's on their
[1:24:37] forehead
[1:24:43] and here's paul doesn't have a clue
[1:24:46] about serving god
[1:24:48] because it wasn't really something they
[1:24:49] drilled into the kids in that church
[1:24:53] imagine the look on a sister's face when
[1:24:57] paul
[1:24:57] dutifully lines up with everyone else
[1:25:00] and goes through the line
[1:25:04] brother i want you to forgive me oh
[1:25:08] what's wrong i said you were stupid
[1:25:14] sister forgive me who why i said you
[1:25:18] were fat
[1:25:22] you think i'm being funny it was that
[1:25:25] ridiculous
[1:25:28] why no revelation at all because the
[1:25:30] real revelation of the word
[1:25:33] that if i had fought those words which i
[1:25:36] did
[1:25:39] the holy ghost the prophet of god said
[1:25:40] when god lays that on your heart
[1:25:43] not when the line that communion is
[1:25:45] fixing to take place
[1:25:47] when god lays it on your heart is when
[1:25:50] we go and say i'm sorry i said what i
[1:25:52] said i'm sorry what i did
[1:25:54] and we come into communion and
[1:25:55] everybody's like wow this must be a
[1:25:57] perfect church
[1:25:58] but you see why it looks perfect is
[1:26:00] because there's unity in that body
[1:26:03] and they are all here and they are unite
[1:26:07] and we're saying i want the water clear
[1:26:10] i want everything clear
[1:26:11] i want it to be that that god would be
[1:26:14] pleased with us
[1:26:16] are you with me saints amen this is our
[1:26:18] job
[1:26:19] not let it not let it drag out well i
[1:26:22] tell you what i do i'd ask them forgive
[1:26:24] me if they ask me to forgive them first
[1:26:25] that's not scriptural
[1:26:27] no if you know there's something there
[1:26:30] go and say you know what forgive me i
[1:26:32] might not even know what i've done but
[1:26:34] forgive me because we need to clear this
[1:26:36] out
[1:26:39] see
[1:26:42] you don't have to give up you can bring
[1:26:46] you don't but you don't never forgive
[1:26:48] jones it'll be all right if you can
[1:26:50] bring in your if you can go you don't
[1:26:52] have to give up you're smoking you're
[1:26:53] drinking you're lying you're stealing
[1:26:55] your
[1:26:55] fault finding your backbiting you don't
[1:26:57] have to give that up just join the
[1:26:59] church
[1:27:00] but moses wasn't a compromiser he wanted
[1:27:03] complete
[1:27:04] deliverance he said we'll not leave one
[1:27:07] hoof
[1:27:07] behind amen we'll take everything that
[1:27:10] belonged to us
[1:27:12] when we go to worship the lord that's
[1:27:14] the way the church
[1:27:15] ought to be we'll take righteousness
[1:27:19] we'll take holiness we'll take the holy
[1:27:22] spirit
[1:27:23] we'll take a unified group when we go to
[1:27:25] the altar
[1:27:27] we be a real group we'll leave
[1:27:30] nothing behind we'll take everything
[1:27:33] there won't be one hoof stay back here
[1:27:35] you know
[1:27:36] and the people can pray in such a way
[1:27:39] till the devil
[1:27:40] will have to give in now saints i'm not
[1:27:44] trying to force an issue on you tonight
[1:27:46] but just the burden on my heart are we
[1:27:48] on the same thought
[1:27:49] are we of one mind are we one accord is
[1:27:52] this a desire that we have
[1:27:54] amen the days of like playing church
[1:27:58] amen i pray that they are just so far
[1:28:00] behind us
[1:28:02] that we just never even look twice
[1:28:05] at playing church hallelujah
[1:28:09] you know on the internet today we have
[1:28:12] what they call
[1:28:13] influencers are you familiar with it
[1:28:16] these are people that have an opinion
[1:28:18] they might be handsome they might be
[1:28:20] pretty they might have a real
[1:28:21] personality
[1:28:22] they can really talk well amen some
[1:28:25] people say preachers or influencers
[1:28:27] if he doesn't have the holy ghost you
[1:28:28] can say he's an influencer
[1:28:30] and he's got the holy ghost it's god
[1:28:32] doing the influencing
[1:28:33] amen but influencers typically in the
[1:28:36] world we live in today
[1:28:38] will go on something like youtube
[1:28:41] twitter uh um pinterest all of these
[1:28:44] things they
[1:28:44] influence people to go certain ways and
[1:28:47] oftentimes there's a sponsor
[1:28:49] because that company likes this person's
[1:28:51] message and how they present it and they
[1:28:53] can influence people
[1:28:54] and typically you might see that they
[1:28:56] have hundreds of thousands of followers
[1:28:59] and
[1:29:00] and uh constantly doing now my brother
[1:29:02] and sister these people
[1:29:03] peddle an opinion to influence others to
[1:29:06] follow fact
[1:29:08] or what they perceive as fact
[1:29:11] now you find these people everywhere
[1:29:16] now sister sue if you're listening
[1:29:17] tonight part of this sermon i say thank
[1:29:19] you for
[1:29:21] she always gives me these history books
[1:29:23] in the war
[1:29:25] and i'm closing saints but i want you to
[1:29:26] catch this part right here
[1:29:30] refugees
[1:29:34] often times they are under the influence
[1:29:38] of influencers
[1:29:42] in a book that sister sue just shared
[1:29:44] with me gave to me as a gift
[1:29:48] refugees in the great war
[1:29:52] in france walking the roads
[1:29:56] headed north
[1:30:01] they're sharing the road
[1:30:04] with refugees from the war
[1:30:07] headed south
[1:30:11] how can this be they're both fleeing
[1:30:12] from the war
[1:30:14] but they're just going to wherever the
[1:30:17] other one was displaced from
[1:30:21] no sanctuary no refuge for them no place
[1:30:25] of sanctuary pressing forward
[1:30:30] and in many cases people collapsing on
[1:30:32] the road
[1:30:33] in in great racking sobs to find that
[1:30:36] they thought that there was some place
[1:30:38] that they were going
[1:30:39] where there would be no war where there
[1:30:41] would be peace where they could
[1:30:42] settle down and they find themselves in
[1:30:45] great despair
[1:30:46] because the very place that they were so
[1:30:49] excited to press
[1:30:50] into is in conflict
[1:30:58] and many times they literally collapsed
[1:31:01] on the side of the road and didn't move
[1:31:02] for days
[1:31:03] in despair
[1:31:07] because all the hope that they had
[1:31:10] has now evaporated
[1:31:14] because of the message
[1:31:17] from someone else who's fleeing
[1:31:22] the war come on
[1:31:26] i hope you catch this
[1:31:30] the laodicean war
[1:31:34] is everywhere you cannot go north
[1:31:38] and escape it you cannot go south and
[1:31:40] escape it
[1:31:41] you cannot go west and escape it you
[1:31:43] cannot go east and escape it
[1:31:45] in fact if you simply uh close the doors
[1:31:48] and huddle inside of your own house
[1:31:50] it will come and creep its way right
[1:31:52] into your house the laodicean war
[1:31:55] is not something to be a refugee from
[1:31:58] but it is something for you and i to
[1:32:01] stand up with the rally cry
[1:32:03] with the battle cry and be able to look
[1:32:05] at one another and say brother
[1:32:07] sister i've got your back i've got you
[1:32:09] we'll fight this we will not give up
[1:32:12] amen to sing the song onward christian
[1:32:14] soldier let it not be just a cute song
[1:32:16] but let it be the reminder
[1:32:18] that we're not here to flee from the
[1:32:20] presence of laodicea
[1:32:22] we're not here to try and hide our
[1:32:24] children from
[1:32:25] the effects of laodicea my brother and
[1:32:28] sister we're here to empower
[1:32:30] our children in laodicea we're here to
[1:32:34] show
[1:32:34] our children they can live the
[1:32:37] overcoming life
[1:32:38] they can be victorious
[1:32:41] hallelujah my brother and sister it's
[1:32:44] not a time for us to flee from our
[1:32:46] problem
[1:32:47] it's time for us to face the problem
[1:32:49] head on
[1:32:50] if we need more of the holy ghost it's
[1:32:52] right here for us
[1:32:54] we need a deliverance from a situation
[1:32:56] it's right here deliverance is right in
[1:32:58] our midst
[1:32:59] and we need some encouragement oh i tell
[1:33:02] you sometimes i need some encouragement
[1:33:04] amen i just need something you know i i
[1:33:07] took up drinking some coffee because i
[1:33:09] thought it might help
[1:33:10] but you know coffee don't do one single
[1:33:12] thing for encouragement
[1:33:18] in fact i haven't figured out much it
[1:33:19] does do
[1:33:23] that you see the laodicean war
[1:33:26] you only find one group of people
[1:33:30] that have purpose in laodicea
[1:33:34] and they're the ones that are pressing
[1:33:36] to christ
[1:33:38] and there it gives oh come on let can i
[1:33:40] can i be real carnal
[1:33:42] when i have just an ounce of permission
[1:33:44] to be just a tad bit carnal
[1:33:46] brothers you want to be successful in
[1:33:48] business
[1:33:50] point towards christ because the more
[1:33:52] you pour in him he says you seek me
[1:33:54] first
[1:33:55] and i'll add all the rest of this stuff
[1:33:57] to you
[1:33:58] amen but what we do is we go out here so
[1:34:00] far and we get sidetracked
[1:34:02] and we get turned this way and we get
[1:34:04] turned to that and then pretty soon we
[1:34:06] join the
[1:34:06] the multitude of the disappointed you
[1:34:10] know that's one of the gr
[1:34:11] greatest or the biggest uh sex there is
[1:34:14] in the
[1:34:14] in the message or one of the biggest
[1:34:16] groups it's in the message is the
[1:34:17] disappointed
[1:34:19] they're the ones happy with pastors they
[1:34:21] don't want to sit home and listen to a
[1:34:22] tape
[1:34:22] they don't want to go sit in a building
[1:34:24] listen to a tape they don't want anybody
[1:34:26] to tell them what to do
[1:34:27] they're waiting for brother branham to
[1:34:28] come back and i'm sorry but i just don't
[1:34:30] see that in the word of god
[1:34:32] amen so they sit there in a place and i
[1:34:35] know people like this they sit there
[1:34:37] with three and four hundred thousand
[1:34:39] dollars worth of ties
[1:34:40] that they're going to give back to
[1:34:41] brother branham soon as he comes back
[1:34:44] but they don't have any scripture to
[1:34:46] back it up
[1:34:47] and i'm not picking on them for that
[1:34:49] fact why i'm picking on them
[1:34:51] saints is because they have chosen to
[1:34:53] join the group of the disappointed
[1:34:56] and we live in an hour when the word of
[1:34:59] god a prophet's words
[1:35:01] said the holy ghost he said he
[1:35:04] is here we got no reason to be
[1:35:07] disappointed
[1:35:08] we got every reason to press into his
[1:35:11] word
[1:35:12] and believe it and confess it and stand
[1:35:14] up and start marching into the battle
[1:35:17] we're not here i'm just reading the same
[1:35:19] book sister shared with me
[1:35:20] amen there was a general that was there
[1:35:23] and he
[1:35:24] said the very best defense is offense
[1:35:28] and when he come into world war one all
[1:35:31] the trenches were dug
[1:35:32] and they just sat there every day and
[1:35:35] basically the people who died got hit by
[1:35:37] a a balm
[1:35:38] or a a mortar shell that come and
[1:35:41] crashed into their
[1:35:42] their place and nobody charged nobody
[1:35:44] there was no face to face they just
[1:35:46] hunkered down in their trenches
[1:35:48] amen every sunday and wednesday
[1:35:52] they didn't do anything imagine where
[1:35:55] that new pastor moved into town
[1:35:59] come on saints can you be with me that
[1:36:01] new pastor coming to town he says and i
[1:36:03] want you guys to all get ready clean
[1:36:04] your guns
[1:36:05] get your stuff ready if you need new
[1:36:06] boots we'll get your new boots if you
[1:36:08] need more ammunition we'll get you more
[1:36:09] ammunition they're like what's going on
[1:36:11] well in two days time we are all
[1:36:13] climbing out of this trench
[1:36:15] and we're running across this 100 yards
[1:36:18] of no man's land
[1:36:19] and we are chasing the germans out of
[1:36:21] their chain
[1:36:22] trench and we are not stopping until we
[1:36:25] have chased them beyond those trees
[1:36:27] and people went i know brother jewels
[1:36:31] just came through town and
[1:36:32] preached we could be delivered but we
[1:36:34] know how it is
[1:36:38] y'all still love me
[1:36:43] but you know happen on the wednesday of
[1:36:45] that week
[1:36:48] 10 000 men died
[1:36:58] but they chased the germans in fact much
[1:37:01] farther than beyond the trees
[1:37:03] they didn't stop chasing them for miles
[1:37:09] i hope you catch this but somebody
[1:37:13] had to die amen somebody had to come to
[1:37:18] the place
[1:37:19] whether it's the altar at home the altar
[1:37:21] in the heart or the altar in the church
[1:37:23] somebody had to come to the place
[1:37:25] they said i'm willing to die
[1:37:32] and they later calculated those 10 000
[1:37:35] men
[1:37:36] maybe saved as many as 50 000
[1:37:39] lives
[1:37:44] sister i'm not here on emotion tonight
[1:37:48] saints
[1:37:49] just a little reminder saints of grace
[1:37:52] we need to make sure we're dead we need
[1:37:55] to make sure that our best defense is
[1:37:57] offense
[1:37:58] that we are not digging a hole somewhere
[1:38:00] to defend ourselves but we're going to
[1:38:01] stand up and say count me in on the
[1:38:03] battle
[1:38:04] because we're going to chase the devil
[1:38:05] out of our church we're going to chase
[1:38:07] the devil out of our homes we're going
[1:38:08] to chase them out of our friends homes
[1:38:10] our brothers sisters home
[1:38:11] we're going to stand together shoulder
[1:38:13] to shoulder because we believe this word
[1:38:16] and it's not just god sent a prophet i
[1:38:18] believe the words that he preached
[1:38:20] amen and those words were to bring a
[1:38:22] revival amongst the people
[1:38:24] and set everything in order oh
[1:38:27] hallelujah
[1:38:29] hallelujah
[1:38:33] oh my i'll just forgo this last
[1:38:38] quote brother brown's talking about how
[1:38:41] when you
[1:38:42] see people and
[1:38:45] i think about our church right here can
[1:38:47] i can i have just a couple more minutes
[1:38:50] i'll try not to commentate too much on
[1:38:52] it
[1:38:57] and we look here we see they're just a
[1:38:58] shadow anyhow we're a shadow
[1:39:01] i look here on the platform see men that
[1:39:02] moves and look out on the streets see
[1:39:04] men and women that moves they got life
[1:39:07] yet it cannot be real life because it's
[1:39:09] death in it
[1:39:10] and david said i'll walk through the
[1:39:11] valley the shadow of death
[1:39:13] now it takes so much light to make a
[1:39:15] shadow
[1:39:16] there has to be so much light and if it
[1:39:19] altogether darkness it cannot make a
[1:39:21] shadow see
[1:39:22] it has to be so much light in the dark
[1:39:24] to make a shadow
[1:39:25] now it depends on which one of those
[1:39:28] sides that you're leaning to
[1:39:30] if i see a man walking fine looking
[1:39:33] young man
[1:39:38] saints i'm sorry but when i read this
[1:39:41] quote i think about the young families
[1:39:42] we have right here
[1:39:44] in our church the little children and
[1:39:47] our
[1:39:47] our mothers our sisters with their
[1:39:49] babies and as i read this quote it
[1:39:52] struck my heart i thought lord
[1:39:55] come quickly come quickly
[1:39:59] but lord if you don't come quickly make
[1:40:01] sure we lord just
[1:40:02] give us something special to stand this
[1:40:05] test of time
[1:40:08] [Music]
[1:40:15] if i see a man walking fine looking
[1:40:18] young man
[1:40:20] in a few years i watch his hair turn
[1:40:21] gray and slip out and his
[1:40:23] shoulders droop down
[1:40:26] beautiful young girl standing with a
[1:40:29] sainted godly face on her and standing
[1:40:31] and praising god
[1:40:33] now come back in a few years and find
[1:40:35] her stoop shoulder
[1:40:37] packing to her children
[1:40:38] [Music]
[1:40:41] oh my
[1:40:44] there it shows that in the body there is
[1:40:47] death
[1:40:47] no matter how well it is and how lovely
[1:40:50] it looks it's still got death in it
[1:40:53] now watch which way that spirit in there
[1:40:55] leans
[1:40:56] now look how brother branham turns this
[1:40:58] saints
[1:40:59] i watch which way that spirit in there
[1:41:02] leans and if it's
[1:41:03] always representing the light speaking
[1:41:06] of the light
[1:41:07] talking of the light it'll go with the
[1:41:09] light
[1:41:10] but if it's always on the other side of
[1:41:12] the world
[1:41:13] the things of the world influenced by
[1:41:15] the world there is nothing but
[1:41:17] it to turn into darkness when it dies
[1:41:20] into outer darkness
[1:41:22] so you see what we are
[1:41:25] we must remember that we are only
[1:41:29] what we are by the grace of god
[1:41:33] and none of us can brag about it we can
[1:41:36] only bow
[1:41:37] in adoration and humility before god and
[1:41:40] give praise to him
[1:41:42] for his goodness and we just stand and
[1:41:44] worship the lord for a minute or two
[1:41:46] brother jason would you have a song
[1:41:48] or two or three
