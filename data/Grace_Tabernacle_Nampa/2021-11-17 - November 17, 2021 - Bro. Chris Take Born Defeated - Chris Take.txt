that i would be out of the way lord jesus that your presence would come and anoint the words lord that you would speak to our hearts we commit listen to your hands of service lord and ask that all things be done for the glory of god amen why don't we stand tonight have your bibles turn with me to john chapter 11. challenge doing that uh verse 38. this is the story of lazarus you can read the rest of the chapter at home if you'd like we're going to pick up here in verse 38 jesus therefore again groaning in himself coming to the grave it was a cave and a stone lay upon it jesus said take you away the stone martha the sister of him that was dead saith unto him lord by this time he stinketh for he hath been dead for days lord it's too hard now it's been too long nothing is impossible with god jesus saith unto her said i not unto thee that if thou is believed thou should have see the glory of god and they took away the stone from the place where the dead was laid and jesus lifted up his eyes and said father i thank thee that thou hast heard me before his requests he thanks the lord for answering his request and i knew that thou hearst me always but because of the people which stand by i said it that they may believe that thou has sent me and when he thus had spoken he cried with a loud voice lazarus come forth and he that was dead came forth bound hand and foot with grave clothes and his face was bound about with the napkin jesus saith unto them loose him and let him go amen may lord a blessing to the reading of his word he may be seated tonight amen my title tonight is probably a bit different but i think you've known me a while know that sometimes they are a bit different my title is born defeated very positive and encouraging but i trusted the lord half his weight tonight i was in the back studying and i had a bunch of quotes and i'm sorry to alex he might have done more work than he have she might have needed to but um and i just felt like it was i had just it was just too cluttered and i was trying to find the direction exactly i knew i knew what god laid in my heart but i was trying to find the direction because the god's word is just abounding and endless and you can take many things and go many different directions and i felt the lord say you know just pull it all out and take this one quote so we'll just ask the lord to come because i cannot do this amen just like any preacher will admit but tonight born defeated so this is as a quote it's kind of long but it's from the message how can i overcome and i have to be honest when i look the quote up i didn't know what came from this message till later on and i realized just how perfectly it lines up with the title how can i overcome but the bible says see as i said at the beginning you are born defeated now you can search the words born defeated and he only says it one time in this mess in his message and that birth can never bring you to life because you're born defeated in other words your natural birth you find no success with your natural birth there's no victory in your natural birth there's no not even any life in your natural birth because you're born defeated and you're in a defeated world amongst defeated people amongst defeated creeds defeated denomination thank you for coming tonight it doesn't end there god always starts here and moves here god always starts something in our lives at a place because we are beings of time god had a vision for us before the foundation of the world god knew where we would be what time in the in life we would in history we would come and god had a story to be written out in our lives god had something that he wanted to do not a single one of us is here tonight without a purpose not a single one of us is here without victory he says you've got to come to victory somehow not maybe you'll need to come to victory or maybe you might come to victory he says you have to come to victory you see if you believe what god has said you are to be you will say there has to be a victory amen if you really accept what god's word says about you man you have to say there will be a victory now the biggest thing that we have to learn is obedience to god's will for our life so how will that victory be interpreted inside of you is going to be different between one and the other god's will for some when they are sick with cancer is to pass on the glory they got their victory god's will for some with cancer is to be healed and live a long longer life and walk and testify of god's healing power you see god has many attributes and i had some quotes i i pulled them out but you can go and you can search and attributes god had an attribute to manifest in victory over death so he needs some saints to cross over in victory over death you see we're not called to to to just vaporize at the end of our life there is a destiny that we have to meet and if you believe that if you can catch that key that god has for you of who you really are you will find victory you will find victory in the morning to get out of bed you will find victory to set down with your devotions and there are things that we learn through our lives and some some will say oh that victory is easy and it's not for another and another would say oh that victory is easy but it's hard over here we all have different interpretations different things in our life that we go through but we will always have to stand and fight to obtain our victory whatever that victory will be but see you were born defeated there's two things as christians we have to learn humility we have to realize i said too but humility and god's grace we have to realize we were born defeated amen we cannot do it amen you say you talk about let's pull a sage from the bible a man of god that had tremendous victory that had many testimonies in his life we'll pull brother paul what did he say i am a prisoner to christ he did not say he was great look he had everything he could ever need to teach the bible and he went and threw it away and he started from scratch if you will he had to unlearn everything that he had received through man's interpretation and god had to take him and say look paul you were born defeated you don't have nothing to bring to this table except for your willingness to surrender paul had to be stripped down everything had to be taken down away from him so he could realize i am born defeated amen but the victory that i need the victory that i am called to is mine for the taking if i will step forward and receive it but you see many times that victory stands there before all we have to do is grab it but we think we're not good enough or there's something that holds us back because we think no we're not ready yet to receive that when all the while god is standing there saying all you have to do is grab it amen we've heard the story hold out the hundred dollar bill how many people came and grabbed it it took a long time for one person finally did but they were still he was standing there with a free hundred dollar bill you see oh what what would be your concerns what would be holding you back from doing that i'm not talking about a job i'm not talking about a girlfriend or anything like that i'm talking about you thinking you're not enough for what god has for you i'm talking about personal complexes i'm talking about things that inhibit us that we are we live defeated because we're living in what we were born but god says i have a victory i'm calling you to live in you were born defeated and you'll have to fight against that every day of your life but he has a victory that you have to come to it's just like a lily whereas the lily i i think is is one of of the most prettiest flowers that there is i'm very fond of those great calla lilies and pawn lily i think there's nothing hardly as pretty as a great big pond billy call it water lily how it's radiant now where does it come from it's a little seed down in the bottom of a muddy mucky pond and that little seed yet all the radiance that'll ever shine in in it is in it right then when it's in that mud now reverend fish swam by one day and saw this dirty little muddy plant in the bottom of the water and he said oh that'll never come to nothing because of its present condition on the outside it was born defeated it was born in the mud at the bottom of the water five to six feet deep that's what they say it was born down there in the mud no potential and that person has no potential god loves people with no potential because a greater testimony amen a greater that's why that's why the bible says it's better that you never even saw with your own eyes and yet you believe a greater victory so that lily's born down there in the bottom in the mud but guess what even though it's down there in the mud it already is that lily on top of the water it already is you can call it a lily you can call yourself a child of god god was calling you a child of god while you were out there making a mess while we were yet sinners christ died for us because you were already a lily you can walk up to somebody if god could show you let's just say for just as an example you had the ability to know this person out here looking like the world very much like the world was a true child of god you can walk up and say nice to meet you brother because he already was a brother nice to meet you sister and that's what christ is doing christ began to call his disciples when he walked the shores of galilee fishermen they're over there arguing with one another who's the greatest wanting to beat up the samaritans and and call down lightning and fire from heaven but see god could see you see well well he could have picked a lot better crowd that's what you could have said if you saw them before the upper room that's what you could have said especially when peter cursed and said he didn't know him but see peter was already brother peter peter was always ready a lily down there in the muck in the mire born defeated but peter had a victory to come to amen a lily has what it needs to get through the mud to the light you have what you need to get through the mud to the light you have what you need to get through the world to get saved to get the holy ghost to start serving god guess what you have what you need to get through your trial took the light on the other side god has already given you the ability and the victory even though you were born defeated all the radiance that'll ever shine he says it's in it right then when it's in that mud but it has to strive daily there's the key say to god they have to strive daily you have to push you have to fight you have to stand in the mud and you find the mud guess what you're covered in you are messy it's mucky it says that he said it's black it's dirty it's mucky it's slimy in that slime that it's living in yet it presses its way through the mud the muck and the waters and the stagnant places until it sticks its head above in the light and expresses what it's been hid in it all the time i think that's an overcomer he says that once in sin once did things that was wrong don't worry about it now once did things that was wrong then now why look back into the pond again see that's it god by his predestination see has brought this seed to life and it's pressing itself see coming to light and now on top of all of that it has overcome see it doesn't express itself down there it's getting up to express itself lily has roots i forget the name of them but they grow down and then they grow back up rhizome or rosem or something like that these roots anchor it in the mud below it is our experience of salvation that can anchor us to christ when someone has a real experience with god knowing what they were before god saved them knowing where they came from don't put a level of how bad it was that does not mean anything right once a sinner you were a sinner that's it there's no greater or less but that that you were that you and you have changed and mercy has rewrote your life and you stand today a lily on the water is your roots is your anchor why because you met christ when you met christ your anchor went down when you met christ your roots begin to spread and you begin to grow from the mud you begin to grow from a defeated state you did not have the ability to do it on your own but the life of christ began to grow inside of you and push you up push you through the mud that's the i think about that all the time says to god the paradox of god he calls you he chooses you before the foundation of the world then he gives you what you need to come to the place he wants you to be all you have to do is surrender that's right all you have to do is accept it all you have to do is say yes i believe god can change me that's all you have to do it's not complicated thanks to god i believe god can heal me don't try to [Music] make yourself healed can't do it don't try to force yourself to deliverance or force yourself to victory yes so no matter how hard that plant pushes he can't grow any faster he'll only grow he'll only grow to the speed of the life that he's receiving to give him the growth that he needs for victory the growth you need for victory comes from your experience with christ god begins to feed you some grow a little faster than others but god's feeding you the life that you need to come to the potential that only he can see sometimes praise the lord neither god by his predestination see has brought this seed to life and it's pressing itself see coming to light next paragraph neither did you and your sin and adultery and everything that you lived in you didn't express nothing but there was a seed in there and it got a chance to press itself into light see your seed pushed you into the light and now you're in the presence of jesus christ with the sunlight it brought out what you really was in the beginning when you were born defeated that's not who you were when you were born in the mud that's not who you really were no sir that's right people wanted to tell you that's what you are people still today want to tell you that's what you are but guess what down inside of you is a life that's going to push that's going to press and push back against the darkness of the world around us till one day we stand in glory next to our king amen that is who we really are that is who we really are you see it's a powerful thing when somebody really believes in themselves amen you can go study uh muhammad ali the boxer statistically physically wasn't better than the next guy but he believed he was better than the next guy and he convinced them that he was better than them he got in their heads so you got to do say hey satan see the devil already knows he's defeated that's right so that that part is already done for you you just have to amen that's why we are the bible listen to tapes right what is it doing it's telling i tell i get up i remember it's telling me chris you are victory chris you are victory amen oh it comes in many fashions the story of lazarus the story in genesis no one in the ark you are victory it's the faith that rises up in you that is the revelation that cry revelation of what god has called you to be praise god see you have to accept it amen many times you're all well every time you're already delivered you just have to accept it and it's not complicated you just have to say you know brother bug when did you start smoking just did you just have to say now is the time if you really believe that god can do it you will step forward and accept it amen that's right praise god yes sir it brought out what you really was in the beginning you see what i mean you saw the light you bloomed out you laid your heart open and now you're a lily that's it you remember my sermon on the lily reverend lilly how he toils and yet does he not spin and yet solomon and all his all of his glory is not arrayed like one of these look at him he's ready he takes nothing for himself the lily don't care about himself what does he do he throws his beauty out his life that others might see his life is expressed out amen then others might see the glory what's in him that was in him in that mud now he's on top lily's like still waters that's what they grow they only bloom for three days every year and the last thing they do is they spread to help the other flowers they give of themselves what's that what but what about them say eternal life was living forever god brought you from the mud set you on top now gives you the beauty of a lily you bloom you receive life you become germinated by the word and then you spread and you give yourself out you live your life for others in an expression of what god has called you to be praise the lord what does he do he throws his beauty out that others might see the glory of what's in him that was in him in that mud now he's on top that's the overcomer he overcome the mud he overcome the things of the world now he freely gives himself out everybody can look at him his life you can't put a finger on it see he's a real overcomer you can't say nothing about him now say he come out of the mud but he's not in the mud now he's not in the mud now oh well you were born defeated that's what satan loves to tell remember the fall remember the flesh that you live in remember how you were born defeated remember when you were in the mud and you couldn't see the light remember that that's who you are that's who you really are this is just an illusion this isn't reality this isn't you know this is but this is not what you think it is he likes to paint a picture he's a he's a he's an artist he's an artist but he paints with fake paint you remember the emperor with no clothes the man sewed him the most beautiful outfit or so he said nobody could see anything but nobody wanted to admit they couldn't see anything there's never nothing there but god's word is the reality amen god word god's word is what's real so it's true so then if the devil's talking to you what is that it's a lie but god's word says you can and you will have victory but he's not in the mud now he's on top of it amen you you can't now point back what he was what is he now he's on top then the bee comes by and says that's a wonderful perfume i believe i'll go and get my part he just opens up his heart come on now all right everything takes from him see he's a real pastor he expresses the glory of god and look where he come from he had to overcome to do that amen you see god had attributes that he wanted to express he wasn't god until he had people to worship him definition of god is one that's worshipped so he wanted to express that he was god he wanted to look so he created people created you and i he wanted to express he was a healer so we got sick he wanted to express all these things that he had inside of him so he created us to fulfill the other part of who he is we complete him that's not blasphemy saints of god mrs jesus christ my wife completes me we complete christ he needed us amen he needed us so he had attributes that he wanted to express so we had hardships and we had trials and we had captivity but god was able to express himself express his attributes but guess what because he called you he has attributes he wants to express through you he has attributes that he expresses on to you when you're healed unto you when you're delivered but he has stuff he has attributes he wants you to express out because guess what you become part of christ you express and you unfold the life of christ to the world around you you're going to express the attributes of christ so in order to be an overcomer you have to have something to overcome he wants you what does the scripture say they overcame him by the blood of the lamb and the word of the testimony god wants is coming for a bride that's an overcomer can you be an overcomer unless you have something you need to overcome absolutely not absolutely not if i want to build a wood desk i got to have wood i found a bit of melted metal desk i got to have metal i got to have what i need in order to bring forth what i want to express god saved you filled you with the holy ghost and he's calling you to overcome because he wants that attribute expressed through you so guess what you're going to have things that you need to overcome the flesh every day of our life we have to overcome this man when you bite your tongue you overcame that man amen and grace wanted to express his attributes through you amen praise the lord your first birth could never bring you to life so god brought the victory to you he said you know what he sent adam and eve down there and they fell so then he said down isaiah job jeremiah they testified of what god was going to do they testified of the victory that was coming they talked about it they preached about it malachi jose expressing prophesying of what god is and wanted to express but there was still something missing there was still a part that had to be expressed in order to receive the whole god had to come down and take the sting out of death death so that you could receive spiritual life god had to calm down and bridge bridget chasm bridge the the the the space between man and god because there was something there in the way he wanted you to be an overcomer but bulls and goats didn't do it right he wanted you to express this he wanted you to be victorious but the blood of an animal didn't do it it only described the attribute of victory it only was a shadow of what god had in store the life that we live today is only a shadow of what god has in store for us in glory saints of god you have been called to be to come through that shadow because you now have the complete and whole part of christ don't live in the shadow the bible says the a though i walk through the valley of the shadow of death we don't stop in the shadow we don't say wow look at the shadow of that cross it's beautiful no we see the shadow and we look to the real thing it's the shadow is just describing everything that god has for you when the spirit of the lord falls and it's a blessing on your flesh it's a shadow of what god wants to do inside of you when on the outside it's it's raining because guess what you're on top of the waters you grow in still waters but it rains it storms the the waves can get big down there with the wind storms can come through you say oh i came through the muck and i'm on top and now you're you know you're facing the storms but you see it's the victory that god gave you over your defeated birth that you can find victory in again when you say if he did it once back there he can do it again today he gives us examples in the scriptures and an expression of his attributes through the victory that job had over his trial job was down in the muck if you will if you allow me the liberty to say so yo job was down there in the mud but you see god wanted to express something through job god wanted to push something out through job god wanted to show the power of christ in a man god wanted to show what a man can do when he's really really tied to christ so the frogs and the fishes came along and said you're just a muddy sinner job you're nothing you're defeated you're born defeated there's nothing that you can do you are a secret sinner and job stood and he said i i i am not i am fulfilling scripture amen i am standing on the shoulders of jehovah i am expressing what god has i am serving god i am giving and full of surrender to god but you see all they could see was the boils that covered him from head to toe how many times does the brother or sister is covered in boils it's an outward expression you can see it and we want to say oh they must have something they're doing wrong when they're just job amen about to express an ultimate victory what is the story of an underdog without defeat there's not much of a story in them in a team that's got all the best players all the best facility the best coaches and wins every single game there's no story but when you have a defeated team who realizes their full potential and loses a game and loses another game and then begins to win a game begins to get closer to the same points a tie to an ultimate victory there's a story there god wanted to show that it didn't matter what the circumstances around the man it didn't matter what it was that he that was in his life that was so dear to him that was shipped away it didn't matter god wanted to show the power that he has when a man is harnessed to his will can overcome the greatest of tragedies so that when you are having a hard time getting out of bed tomorrow you can remember job so when you have a hard time next week on your job you can remember job so when we preach services like this we can't talk about job you see a story of the expression of god's attributes manifested through a man that we could call brother a man in our shoes that we could call brother expressing the attributes that god desired even though he was born defeated god had a victory for job to come to gideon was living defeated gideon was born defeated you say pick me a man that's born defeated uh gideon if you lived with him remember that guy getting in high school man that guy was such a yeah i remember what's he only collects green for daddy not much of a man just kind of you know whatever not much of a warrior you see we're all born defeated when we come out of the womb gideon was born defeated out of them but gideon stayed defeated just because you're born defeated doesn't mean you need to stay defeated that's what god that's what the title is about right you're born defeated but you have to come to a victory you're born defeated but you are an attribute of christ gideon was down behind the wine press and i apologize for always using gideon maybe somebody just needs to hear about gideon more often or maybe i just connected with him and the angel says gideon you are a mighty man of valor no i'm not okay real mind gideon an angel of god just told you you're a mighty man of valor no i'm not gideon get in when's the last time you saw an angel no i'm not gideon an angel told you you are a mighty man of valor whoa yeah wow okay uh get in do you know where angels come from do you know where the angel got that message christ amen do you know where your angel got his message straight from the throne christ you are a mighty man of valor i could call every single one of your names and say you are a mighty man a mighty woman of valor you already are amen gideon says okay i kind of sort of believe that but i need to test that i need to i need to make sure that's true let me allow me to run a few experiments god in his infinite mercy and wisdom and patience allowed that because guess what if gideon and that's if gideon just would have buried his doubts pushed them aside they are still there and just okay okay yeah let's do this but all the time thinking huh was that really an angel was that really the gideon in the beginning turned and faced them thomas in the beginning turned and faced his doubts he didn't just go with the crowd because that was the right thing to do he didn't just get up and and praise god in the meeting because everyone else was he waited and he said i'll fleece no no doing the ground though fleece wet the fleece dry dew on the ground an offering of food consumed by fire gideon was offering up himself he was surrendering his doubts of who god said he was now you see the next time you say well gideon had doubts again he did but those doubts for whether or not he could be victorious over the midianites but he knew he was a mighty man of hour because christ told him he was born defeated living defeated but then the message came you are a mighty man of healer he stood up and then he went forward and had victory god shipped him of all the men testing him why because if he had all the men of israel guess what scoffers could have said well you had a lot of soldiers but i said let me let me really prove my point scoffer should have said oh yeah but if lazarus had died let me prove my point well yeah if lazarus had been in the grave for four whole days let me prove my point you see sometimes we think god's not on time sometimes we think why isn't this prayer been answered yet when all god is doing is creating a greater testimony because somebody needs to hear it maybe you it's going to bless you but maybe god is conditioning and setting forth in you a place where you can speak from experience and say you know what four days late still on time oh he passed away but god spoke his name from the grave he was in a dark cane and a stone was rolled you think their destiny is sealed you think your loved one's destiny is sealed because a stone is rolled over the cave god says lazarus come forth lazarus come forth did he walk out perfect no he came walking out in grave clothes he came walking out showing signs of the world but god said take those off of him and let him go you as a child of god have the ability to stand in faith and remove the grave clothes and let them go are they bound by your unforgiveness are they bound by your bitterness are they bound by your inability to see the true potential that god has placed inside of them because all you can accept is the outward muddy nature amen but all they need is someone to say you are a mighty man of valor all it is i'm going to say you are better than this i had the opportunity the last few days to visit with an old friend who's not serving god he told me he wants the message to be true but he just hasn't come there yet and i said you have these are my exact words but i said you have potential i'm not lifting myself up in any way i'm sharing a testimony i believe one day we're gonna see the fruits of that desire you know i'm not gonna look at the man on the outside i'm not gonna look at what he's doing or how he's talking i'm going to look at the desire that's in his heart guess what sometimes that desire doesn't come from their lips sometimes that desire can can get won't express it verbally to you but you have to have faith that the mud that covers that lily is going to wash away in the light of the sun and you have to believe it as much as you want them to amen now i believe we're going to see your testimony praise well the musicians want to come tonight you know we sing that song he's in the house and i thought it was very fitting because that's the story of i think it's jairus daughter dead but jesus said no she's just asleep what did he see he saw a true potential he saw born defeated but resurrection destined lazarus was dead he was born defeated and he died just like his body was destined to be but god said the story doesn't end here and god called out his name from death that little girl was lying there everybody was crying everyone was sad everyone had given up hope because she had passed away but god came in the house when god comes in your house when god comes in the house victory has arrived and he said look saints of god he said look my children she's not dead she's just asleep she forgot who she was supposed to be so she fell asleep maybe it was on a church pew maybe it was at home but she fell asleep she forgot who she was she didn't stay awake she fell asleep saints of god don't fall asleep don't fall asleep stand up and remember you are victorious i know you're tired i know you're weary but god says don't fall asleep we know some that have fell asleep we want to say they're dead but god is in the house tonight and he says they are just asleep and the word will speak and the word will bring them from that place and they will stand alive testifying of the power and the grace of jesus christ [Music] because he's in the house he said well i i can't i can't my kids are falling asleep what do i need to do get jesus in the house [Music] i'm falling asleep i i have my sword and my vision is swimming i'm falling asleep get jesus in the house because he has a desire to see you express the attribute of an overcomer [Music] he's going to give you oh they have they want to prescribe everything for for people that fall asleep more caffeine but it only works for a short amount of time you go to revival you just drink a big old thing of caffeine a big old thing of spiritual revival at a meeting and then it goes away because that's all it was it was a flesh stimulant but god's not calling you to just that he's calling you to a deeper thing and that was in my notes take me deeper that's my desire lord take me deeper you say oh you know that brother is such a man of faith and his desire is crying out saying take me deep [Music] the deeper you go in christ amen the more awake you are the natural types of spiritual they have a perversion they call woke guess what the reality of that is a bride that's standing wide awake oh the music of laodicea is playing softly the music is playing softly trying to put you to sleep but you gotta have that thing inside of you that keeps you woke if if you will permit me to use that term amen god has given us the ability we were born defeated but a victory has to come amen praise the lord like preaching more but i don't think i have any more words let's bow our heads you know he says we're born defeated in a defeated world with a defeated people with defeated creeds with defeated denominations but we have to come to a victory the victory expresses what's been hid all along yes everything around you is defeated the creeds the denominations the people the world is defeated but you stand to testify of the victory that is found in jesus christ heavenly father lord jesus i just asked or not knowing exactly how this is going to go tonight father i just pray that father what was said lord would touch the hearts of your people i know i needed to hear it it is an encouraging father lord so many times the devil with through conflict is one of us that wants to tell us we're less than who we are make us feel inferior to the promises of god but those promises are exactly for us no matter what they are lord victory in relationships victory for our loved ones

message that came from you lord and stand up and accept our victory even before we have it even before it manifests inside of us before gideon ever went to battle he already had the victory and he knew it you gave him that encouragement lord father i ask that you just give that encouragement to your people tonight but as gideon slipped down to the put his ear to the tent all the major people tonight slip down and put their ear to the tent of the enemy and hear how they're going to be victorious oh god we thank you for your love your mercy your grace lord we thank you for coming into our house and bringing us the victory that we needed to become sons and daughters of god we always were but lord now we're expressing that forth we thank you lord we pray for those that we love and
