[9:21] I love to

[9:30] worth. It
[9:32] sounds like

[9:57] Jesus.
[9:59] Oh, how I love
[10:06] Jesus.

[10:16] Because he first loved
[10:23] me. It tells me
[10:27] of a
[10:30] savior's
[10:31] love who
[10:34] died to set me free.
[10:41] He
[10:42] tells me
[10:45] of his
[10:47] preious love, the
[10:51] sin's
[10:53] perfect

[11:35] what my
[11:38] father
[11:40] has in
[11:42] store for
[11:44] every day.
[11:49] And
[11:50] though I
[11:52] tread a
[11:55] dark some path yield
[11:59] sunshine
[12:01] all the way. Let's sing a verse four
[12:04] now. Oh, it
[12:07] tells of one whose
[12:12] loving heart can feel my
[12:18] deepest wo.
[12:23] to
[12:24] win. Each
[12:27] sorrow
[12:29] bears a part that none can bear

[13:45] me.
[13:49] Amen. Why don't we stand together? We'll
[13:52] sing number
[14:01] 478. For a long time I
[14:08] traveled down a long lonely road.
[14:14] My heart was so heavy in sin. I sang
[14:22] low. Then I heard about
[14:28] Jesus. What a wonderful
[14:34] hour. I'm so glad that I found out he
[14:39] could bring me out through his saving
[14:43] power.
[14:46] Oh, thank God. I am free, free, free
[14:52] from this world of
[14:56] sin. I've been washed in the blood of
[15:01] Jesus. I've been born
[15:06] again. Hallelujah. I'm saved. Saved.
[15:12] saved by his wonderful
[15:17] grace. And I'm so glad that I found out
[15:22] he could bring me out and show me the
[15:28] way. Like a bird out of
[15:34] prison that's taking its flight.
[15:40] Like a blind man that God gave back his
[15:48] sight. Like a poor wretched
[15:53] beggar that's found fortune and
[15:59] fame. I'm so glad that I found out he
[16:04] could bring me out through his holy
[16:07] name.
[16:11] Thank God I am free. Free. Free from
[16:17] this world of
[16:21] sin. Been washed in the blood of Jesus.
[16:26] I've been born
[16:30] again. Hallelujah. I'm saved. Saved.
[16:36] saved by his wonderful
[16:40] grace. And I'm so glad that I found out
[16:45] he could bring me out and show me the
[16:49] way. Thank God I am free. Oh, thank God
[16:54] I am free. Free. Free from this world of
[17:03] sin. Been washed in the blood of Jesus.
[17:08] I've been born
[17:12] again. Hallelujah. I'm saved. Saved.
[17:18] Saved by his wonderful
[17:23] grace. I'm so glad that I found out he
[17:28] could bring me out and show me the way.

[26:01] 746.
[26:03] [Music]
[26:07] Here is
[26:09] love vast as the
[26:13] ocean. Loving
[26:17] kindness as a flood.
[26:22] And the
[26:23] prince of life, our
[26:27] ransom, shed for
[26:31] us his preious
[26:35] blood. Who his
[26:37] love will not
[26:42] remember? Who can
[26:44] cease to sing his praise?
[26:50] He will
[26:52] never be
[26:56] forgotten throughout
[26:59] heaven's
[27:00] eternal days.
[27:04] On the
[27:05] mount of
[27:09] crucifixion, fountains
[27:12] open deep and
[27:16] wide through the
[27:19] floodgates of God's
[27:23] mercy flows

[29:49] him. That's number
[29:51] 524 as brother Paul comes. Let's stand
[29:54] together.
[29:58] When I saw the cleansing
[30:06] fountain,
[30:08] open wide for all my sin.
[30:17] I oyed the spirit's
[30:23] wooing when he said, "Wilt thou be
[30:32] clean?
[30:34] I will praise
[30:37] him.
[30:39] I will praise him.
[30:44] Praise the lamb for sinner
[30:51] slain.
[30:53] Give him glory all ye
[30:59] people. For his blood has washed
[31:04] away each
[31:09] stain.
[31:11] Though the way seems straight and
[31:18] narrow,
[31:19] all I claimed was swept away.
[31:28] My ambitions, plants and
[31:32] [Music]
[31:35] wishes at my feet in ashes
[31:43] lay. Oh,
[31:45] I will praise
[31:48] him.
[31:49] I will praise him.
[31:54] Praise the lamb for sinners

[32:15] each stain.
[32:21] And God's fire upon the
[32:25] [Music]
[32:28] altar of my heart was set a
[32:36] flame.
[32:38] I shall never cease to praise him.

[33:47] in.
[33:49] He's forgiven my
[33:56] transgressions. He has cleansed my heart

[35:04] Ye
[35:06] [Music]
[35:07] people for his blood has washed
[35:13] away each.
[35:17] Can we just take a moment and just thank
[35:19] the Lord? His blood has washed away each
[35:23] and every stain. Father, we stand before
[35:26] you today. We lift our hands and our
[35:28] hearts to say thank you, Lord. In a
[35:31] world that is so troubled and it seems
[35:33] to spill over into our lives, we still
[35:35] can come to the security and the
[35:38] confidence, Lord Jesus, that your blood
[35:41] has washed away each and every stain,
[35:44] Father. Each hindrance, Lord, that would
[35:47] be in our life, Father. It's already
[35:50] been placed under the blood, you've
[35:52] already said it is finished. And we get
[35:54] to stand here this morning, Father, just
[35:56] to say thank you and give you praise, oh
[35:59] Lord. How it stirs my heart that this
[36:02] song would be the song, Father, that
[36:04] would be the leading to this service
[36:07] today, Lord, for it truly fits perfectly
[36:10] with what you laid upon my heart. And my
[36:12] heart is rejoicing for truly, Father, we
[36:15] stand here today with the greatest
[36:17] privilege to worship you, Father. Lord,
[36:20] not as slaves, not as servants, but as
[36:23] sons and daughters of God, called to be
[36:25] the very bride of Jesus Christ, to dwell
[36:28] with you through eternity. Father, what
[36:31] a blessing it is, Father, to be lifted
[36:33] up, Lord, into your presence, Lord, in
[36:36] our worship, Father, today in these
[36:38] songs, Father, in the prayers that were
[36:41] prayed, Father. We we thank you, Lord,
[36:43] that you've opened this uh window, as it
[36:46] were, to us this morning to be able to
[36:48] give praise to you from our hearts. Lord
[36:51] Jesus, I say thank you, Lord. Come down.
[36:54] You know the needs. You know the
[36:56] requests, the desires. Father, you know
[36:58] every circumstance. Lord, we just commit
[37:00] them to you today. In the name of Jesus
[37:03] Christ, we say thank you, Lord. Thank
[37:06] you, Lord. Thank you, Lord.
[37:09] Hallelujah.
[37:10] Hallelujah. Amen. It is good to be here
[37:14] today. Amen.
[37:17] It is good to be here today.
[37:19] Amen. Hallelujah. Just a couple little
[37:23] things I want to bring before you. Thank
[37:25] you, musicians. I appreciate each and
[37:27] every one of you. Amen.
[37:30] Um I was visiting with brother Jose up
[37:33] there in the Tri Cities and uh he just
[37:36] desired that we would remember uh the
[37:39] little group there in prayer. Uh the
[37:42] Lord is just doing some incredible
[37:44] things and brother Jose is just his real
[37:47] heart's desire is that these things just
[37:49] don't come to a dead end. Uh that it's
[37:53] there. He's been witnessing. He says the
[37:56] door is just being opened right and left
[37:59] for him to witness to to people and uh
[38:03] to families. And Lord willing, hopefully
[38:06] the devil didn't get his his uh uh nose
[38:09] in the business, but a family was
[38:11] coming. Uh brother Jose had hired uh
[38:15] another employee to help him in um in
[38:18] the uh stone business. And um this man
[38:22] after working with him for a period of
[38:24] time says uh I I want to know what is it
[38:27] you believe? I want to know what is
[38:30] different about you. And so as he starts
[38:33] to witness to this this man is uh not a
[38:36] sinner as it were. He is a man that has
[38:39] been faithful in church and yet certain
[38:42] circumstances had come and brought them
[38:44] to a place with their like feel like
[38:47] they're in a just a little bit of a
[38:50] limbo. And uh he told brother Jose said
[38:53] I I just feel like I I I need something
[38:57] more. Brother Joseing the leadership of
[39:00] the Lord starts to speak to him and the
[39:02] man is like I've not heard these words
[39:04] expressed before. So we want to remember
[39:08] that another gentleman uh is um been a
[39:12] minister for many years is moving owns a
[39:14] house in the Tri Cities and uh is moving
[39:17] back there and ask uh brother Jose to do
[39:20] some work on that house and they start
[39:23] witnessing
[39:25] uh uh talking to each otherise and uh
[39:28] the man's wife has cancer in her leg.
[39:31] she can no longer bend her knee. And um
[39:34] she comes to brother Jose while they're
[39:37] there discussing these things and says
[39:40] um I want you to pray for me. Amen. Now
[39:43] you talk about God coming down in a
[39:45] divine fashion. That's right. Brother
[39:47] Jose instead of just saying I will pray
[39:49] for you says you've had good men of God
[39:52] pray for you before, haven't you? And
[39:55] she says yes yes I have. He
[39:59] says, "You need to just believe." Amen.
[40:03] You need to have faith. God's already
[40:06] healed you. Is that not his word? And
[40:09] this lady was there and she said, "It's
[40:12] it's the truth." And her husband was
[40:14] like, "No one's ever expressed it to us
[40:18] like that." So God just catching
[40:21] attention and opening these doors. Uh he
[40:24] also desires that we would remember his
[40:28] natural sister, sister Margarita. Uh we
[40:31] have prayed here in the church sometime
[40:33] past here about her eyesight and uh they
[40:37] have now figured out that it's actually
[40:40] brain cancer and uh so uh brother Jose
[40:45] is desiring and sister Margarita is
[40:47] desiring that we would just lift her
[40:50] before the Lord once again. Lord just
[40:52] give us faith. to believe. Amen. Uh
[40:57] let's see. I got a couple other things
[40:59] here. Uh communicating with brother John
[41:02] Andy's. He desires to be remembered in
[41:04] prayer today. Of course, uh today, this
[41:07] morning early was their uh uh 8 hours
[41:10] ahead of us was their last meeting at
[41:13] the camp in Poland. Uh and um he said it
[41:17] was uh a real blessing, a real success.
[41:20] Amen. He's on to the Netherlands,
[41:22] Belgium, and Germany just one after
[41:24] another preaching, travel, preach,
[41:26] travel, preach, travel. Desired that we
[41:29] would remember him, that the Lord would
[41:31] just grant him strength. We also want to
[41:33] remember brother Barry. I know it seems
[41:36] like family camp's a long ways away, but
[41:38] it will be here like that. So, let's be
[41:41] remembering our brother Barry. The Lord
[41:43] would just uh lay upon his heart those
[41:45] things that would just bless us. the
[41:47] families. I I pray each and every one of
[41:50] you will be able to go. Uh if you have
[41:53] any limiting factors, please talk to the
[41:56] brothers. If there's something we can do
[41:58] to eliminate a factor that would keep
[42:00] you from going to family camp, we would
[42:03] do all that we can within our our
[42:05] ability, whether it's financial or what
[42:08] it might be. Amen. So, let's just
[42:10] remember that. I had a lovely
[42:12] conversation with our brother Craig Ber
[42:14] and um just didn't really intend to call
[42:18] him to say, "Hey, don't forget my
[42:20] invitation." But he's the one that
[42:22] brought it up and said, "I haven't
[42:23] forgotten." So, we're looking for the
[42:26] day that's there. They've had a little
[42:27] trouble, had a little stuff, some things
[42:30] in the church. And uh uh just to give
[42:33] you a very briefest, Brother Craig just
[42:35] felt led of the Lord to resign from the
[42:37] church. And uh he was, you know, Lord,
[42:41] where would you want me to move? And uh
[42:44] you got to love the Lord's answers. The
[42:46] Lord told him to move just down the road
[42:49] to the next little town. And he went
[42:52] there and started again a church from
[42:56] scratch. And we're not wanting to talk
[42:59] politics, who's right, who's wrong.
[43:01] There's always a right and a wrong. But
[43:04] the Lord led him to go there. And uh the
[43:07] bulk or multitude of the church
[43:09] recognized there was certain
[43:11] circumstances and they have followed
[43:13] him. And uh he said he's never had such
[43:17] liberty. Amen. To preach to the saints.
[43:20] God is coming. God is moving in their
[43:22] midst and and just moving powerfully.
[43:25] Not just moving but moving powerfully.
[43:27] And um so part of what was brought up is
[43:31] um they have made an offer to lease a
[43:34] building. Uh it was a convention uh uh
[43:39] building attached to a 7th day Adventist
[43:42] church and it's actually been unused for
[43:45] several years just sitting there
[43:47] completely unused. and uh brother Craig
[43:51] and the and the trustee board made an
[43:53] offer to them that uh as it is now where
[43:57] they're renting, they have a certain
[43:58] time they can be there. They have to be
[44:00] out by a certain time and uh it really
[44:03] limits the believers who drive quite a
[44:05] distance. Uh I I sure appreciate um
[44:09] those like here in the body driving from
[44:11] Boisee uh from wherever it might be. uh
[44:15] eagle, you know, you commit that time.
[44:18] You give that up. And uh not to downplay
[44:21] what we have, but they have believers
[44:24] that don't really live that far away,
[44:26] and it takes them 4 hours to get to
[44:28] church because of traffic. And so, it's
[44:30] just one giant gridlock on the way to
[44:33] church, one giant gridlock on the way
[44:35] home. And uh you know, not far removed
[44:37] from the Washington DC area, just a few
[44:40] million people stuffed into that area.
[44:43] So, they've made this offer to the 7th
[44:45] Day Adventist Church. If you'll let us
[44:48] make some upgrades, give us a long-term
[44:51] uh to have this for our exclusive use.
[44:56] And so, this
[44:58] week coming up, it goes before that
[45:02] church's board. And uh Brother Craig
[45:05] just asked if we would just lift that to
[45:07] the Lord that the Lord would bless them.
[45:08] And he said the building would work
[45:11] perfect for them to be able then for
[45:14] believers to come. It's got another
[45:16] little section. They could bring lunch
[45:17] or fix lunch and fellowship and you know
[45:21] start to have some of these things. And
[45:23] and as it is now they don't have a
[45:24] Wednesday night service because they
[45:26] have nowhere to hold it. And so and now
[45:29] there's the believers are really hungry.
[45:32] God is moving and they're saying if
[45:34] there was a place for us on Wednesday
[45:36] night um we we would be there. So let's
[45:39] remember brother Craig and and the
[45:41] believers there. And uh also my last
[45:44] announcement um would like to have Grace
[45:47] Kids at our house this Friday, May 9th,
[45:51] 700 p.m. So I'd like to invite all of
[45:54] those that are in our Grace Kids um
[45:58] group to come and and have a good time.
[46:02] Once again, good to be in the house of
[46:03] the Lord today. Amen. Let's just turn in
[46:06] our Bibles to John the 12th chapter
[46:09] verse
[46:11] 23-37. And um I want to speak to you
[46:14] today on um Christ lifted up in our day.
[46:20] And as we'll turn in this scripture and
[46:22] start to read uh you'll you'll see uh
[46:26] the uh foundation of where we are coming
[46:29] from. And
[46:32] uh may God bless his word.
[46:35] John 12 and
[46:38] 23 Jesus answered them, saying, "The
[46:41] hour has come that the Son of Man should
[46:43] be glorified. Verily, verily, I say unto
[46:46] you, except a corn of wheat fall into
[46:48] the ground and die, it abideth alone.
[46:51] But if it die, it bringeth forth much
[46:54] fruit. He that loveth his life shall
[46:57] lose it. He that hateth his life in this
[47:00] world shall keep it in life eternal unto
[47:04] life eternal. If any man serve me, let
[47:06] him follow me. Where I am, there shall
[47:09] also my servant be. If any man serve me,
[47:12] him will my father honor. And I really
[47:15] want to just focus for one second on
[47:18] this, not to keep you standing, but
[47:20] let's remember, my brother and sister,
[47:23] if we
[47:24] serve, we are honored.
[47:27] It really is something we should
[47:29] consider, think about. You see, service
[47:32] isn't the
[47:34] preachers. Service is service. Service
[47:38] is a witness, a testimony. It is a life
[47:41] lived in the workplace, in the
[47:44] marketplace, wherever the place may be.
[47:47] And God promises here that if you serve
[47:50] me, I will honor you. Are we looking for
[47:54] earthly honor? Absolutely not. But it
[47:58] spills over into this life right here.
[48:01] God honoring us. Amen. Now is my soul
[48:06] troubled. And what shall I say? Father,
[48:08] save me from this hour. Because he's
[48:10] come knows he's coming to the
[48:11] crucifixion. But for this cause came I
[48:14] unto this hour. Father glorify thy name.
[48:18] Then came there a voice from heaven,
[48:20] saying,"I have both glorified it and
[48:23] will glorify it again." The people
[48:27] therefore that stood by and heard it
[48:29] said that it thundered. And others said,
[48:31] "An angel spake to him." Jesus answered
[48:34] and said, "This voice came not because
[48:37] of me, but for your sake." And I once
[48:41] again interject this because it's not
[48:42] really in our topic today that the voice
[48:45] came my brother and sister in this day
[48:48] right here not to as it were now hear me
[48:54] not to glorify God in
[48:57] himself not to glorify the prophet but
[48:59] the voice came for you and I.
[49:03] That's how God chose to do it. Now in
[49:06] this because it is the word, it will
[49:08] bring glory to God and it has bought
[49:12] brought a a a measure of glory to the
[49:16] prophet in the love and respect that the
[49:19] bride of Christ has for God's messenger,
[49:22] right? We don't hold him as an icon. We
[49:24] don't pray to him. Uh we we don't uh
[49:27] come as it is idol worship, but we have
[49:31] love and respect. And I I'm looking
[49:33] forward to the day when we stand there
[49:36] in the in the presence of God and that
[49:38] we can be able to look upon our Lord
[49:41] Jesus Christ and from the very depths of
[49:43] our hearts say, "Lord, I love you." But
[49:45] we'll also be able to look upon uh and
[49:49] meet uh brother Brandham face to face
[49:51] and tell him, "Thank you for the
[49:54] sacrifice you made to bring the word in
[49:57] our day." And then beyond that, we will
[50:00] go and we will be sharing our
[50:02] thanksgiving for the
[50:04] prayers, the life and the influence of
[50:07] the saints. I I I think we'll we'll
[50:11] probably put that on the church site,
[50:13] but it was shared with me. It's on
[50:15] YouTube. I don't remember the title, but
[50:18] uh a a brother's testimony uh either
[50:21] Spanish or Portuguese speaking country
[50:24] because it's uh interpreted uh into
[50:27] English over uh that. But um my brother
[50:30] and sister, some people would call it
[50:33] idolatry, but a man, I'll just give you
[50:36] this hint, whose baby girl
[50:39] drowned, wasn't really a believer at
[50:42] that time, but in such desperation had
[50:45] been witnessed to over and over
[50:49] again. And he said,
[50:52] 'Lord, if the
[50:55] message of William Brham is
[50:59] true, raise up my baby
[51:02] girl. She's dead. This is not an
[51:06] unconscious state. She's
[51:07] dead. And when he said
[51:10] that, she coughed. Amen. And started
[51:13] breathing.
[51:15] And today, she's this lovely, healthy
[51:18] little five-year-old girl. Amen. Amen.
[51:21] We serve an awesome God. Amen. The man,
[51:25] you have to understand this is the point
[51:26] I want to make. The man was not saying
[51:28] William Brham, but he was talking about
[51:31] the words, the gospel, the life. Amen.
[51:34] Of Jesus Christ that was spoken. And
[51:36] that life is real. And it brings life.
[51:40] Amen. Excuse
[51:43] me. The voice came not because of me,
[51:46] but for your sakes. Now is the judgment
[51:48] of this world. Now shall the prince of
[51:50] this world be cast out. And I if I be
[51:53] lifted up from the earth will draw all
[51:55] men unto me. Thus this he said
[51:59] signifying uh what death he should die.
[52:02] The people answered him, we have heard
[52:04] out of the law that Christ abideth
[52:06] forever. How saith thou the son of man
[52:09] must be lifted up. Who is this son of
[52:13] man? Then Jesus said unto them, "Yet a
[52:16] little while is the light with you. Walk
[52:19] while ye have the light, lest darkness
[52:22] come upon you. For he that walketh in
[52:24] darkness knoweth not whether he goeth."
[52:27] And while ye have light, believe in the
[52:30] light, that you may be children of
[52:33] light, these things spake Jesus, and
[52:35] departed, and did hide himself from
[52:37] them. But though he had done so many
[52:41] miracles before them, yet they believed
[52:44] not on him. Heavenly Father, we just ask
[52:47] you to bless your word today. Bless the
[52:49] saints. Father, wherever they may be
[52:51] today, Lord, speak to the hearts of your
[52:53] children. We ask in the name of Jesus
[52:55] Christ. Amen. You may be
[52:58] seated.
[52:59] Hallelujah. Get all teary eyed here and
[53:02] I can't hardly even read my my screen.
[53:05] Amen. I just think about that brother
[53:08] and and and we will we will post that um
[53:11] just so that uh you can um see that.
[53:15] Amen. So now as we look through the
[53:18] word, we'll find that in every age there
[53:22] has been a group of people. And it's not
[53:24] that there's a group of people, my
[53:26] brother and sister, but there's a group
[53:28] of willing people. And there's quite a
[53:30] bit of difference between just being
[53:32] there and desiring and longing and
[53:35] wanting to be there to to be in the
[53:38] presence of God to see his power and
[53:40] majesty displayed. and we'll look down
[53:42] through the ages and and you come and in
[53:45] our youth group, the conversation
[53:47] touched on the uh dark ages for just a
[53:50] moment. And my brother and sister, it
[53:53] takes more than a human emotion to cause
[53:55] you to walk out and give your life for
[53:57] the gospel. The human emotion will tell
[54:00] you just back up a little bit, live
[54:03] another day. You know, you can do
[54:05] something else to express your faith in
[54:08] God. But when you have something that
[54:11] has come that's made you so willing that
[54:13] when they say look you can live if you
[54:15] recent Christ or you're going to die and
[54:18] they were so willing there were many who
[54:21] turned back and walked away in Fox's
[54:25] book uh of uh martyrs you know there's a
[54:28] story of a man who who recanted and
[54:32] spent a night in bitter
[54:34] tears now they were not going to pursue
[54:37] him again because he has recanted. But
[54:40] in the early morning hours, he walks
[54:43] down to where they are burning the
[54:44] saints at the stake and says, "I recant
[54:48] what I
[54:49] recanted." And they said, "What are you
[54:52] doing? You're wealthy. You've got all of
[54:53] this." And he says, "I cannot live with
[54:57] myself." And he did something that was
[54:59] very unique because they never allowed
[55:02] it to happen again. And he told them, "I
[55:05] am so committed, you do not need to tie
[55:07] me, chain me to the post. I will stand
[55:11] here and willingly let you sacrifice me.
[55:14] Burn me at the stake." And in that time
[55:17] as they lit the fire, what happened was
[55:20] as the flames are licking up around his
[55:22] body, he lifted his hands in praise to
[55:25] the Lord. And as his hands are lifted,
[55:28] they're expecting any moment for it to
[55:31] collapse because he's not tied. But as
[55:33] the flames consumed him, his hands never
[55:36] fell. And he is there worshiping God to
[55:39] the breath left his body. And it was
[55:42] such a condemnation to those people,
[55:44] they never ever again did not tie one's
[55:48] arms to the post. Because you see, into
[55:52] his very death, he was there. He's he's
[55:55] there. He's being consumed. I I don't
[55:57] know if any of you have ever been
[55:58] burned, but it is it is not something
[56:02] that you do not react to. Amen. When
[56:05] when you are burnt, uh you you have an
[56:08] immediate reaction to pull away from.
[56:11] And and yet here was a man who willingly
[56:14] stood there and gave his life for the
[56:16] gospel. And every age has had its
[56:19] witnesses that have willingly stood
[56:22] against the pressure of the age,
[56:25] influence of the age, and have stood
[56:27] there and said, "I will serve God. I
[56:30] will not deny him because he is who I
[56:34] am." We are not our own. We belong to
[56:37] him. He is there as it would be by the
[56:40] blood of Jesus Christ. He is uh uh we
[56:43] are his possession. And uh so it's there
[56:47] and and a willing people who are willing
[56:49] to stand on truth. You know, my brother
[56:51] and sister, we could be a much larger
[56:53] church today if we would just compromise
[56:56] on just a few things. Nothing too
[56:58] awfully
[57:01] serious except for one word is enough to
[57:04] separate us from God.
[57:07] So the not too serious is very serious
[57:11] because that one word that separates us
[57:14] from the presence of God means we're no
[57:16] longer in the realm of being the bride
[57:18] of Christ. We're now in a religion. And
[57:21] I I don't want to I'm not here today for
[57:23] religion. I'm here for the relationship
[57:26] that God has offered to us to be sons
[57:28] and daughters of God. So as we're
[57:30] willing to stand on the truth and to
[57:32] claim the truth, but it also brings us
[57:35] as it is uh steps, baby steps, we have
[57:38] to stop and say this is the truth. We
[57:41] have to claim that it is truth. And God
[57:43] wants us to go another step and start
[57:46] confessing its truth. And if we're
[57:48] confessing it to ourselves in a dark
[57:50] room, my brother and sister, that's not
[57:52] really a confession. So God wants us to
[57:55] be open out who we are and why we
[57:59] believe what we believe. You'll find the
[58:02] more open you get, it will polarize and
[58:04] there'll be people who respect you for
[58:06] who you are, not the least bit
[58:09] interested in what you are. Amen. So
[58:11] they'll recognize you as a nice person
[58:13] that they like to be around, but hey,
[58:15] we've got our religion, you've got
[58:17] yours. And so they will never ever
[58:20] inquire or or have interest in that. But
[58:23] see, you'll find that rare person.
[58:26] You'll find that one that the
[58:28] circumstance just as brother Jose
[58:30] shared, the circumstance brings people
[58:33] who who uh uh have a certain faith. They
[58:36] have not a religion. They have not
[58:38] walked away from it, but they find
[58:40] themselves in in a in a center place.
[58:43] They find themselves uh stuck between
[58:46] two opinions. And in there they start to
[58:49] soulsearch. Now in this case we don't
[58:51] know what God will do in their life. But
[58:53] I do know my brother and sister that God
[58:56] has put something in there to cause them
[58:58] to stop and listen. And that's
[59:00] important. And we should, as the word
[59:03] says, be ready to speak. Be instant in
[59:05] season and out of season and put away
[59:08] all of our what will they think of us?
[59:10] Because they're on the other side of
[59:12] this equation saying if I say I believe
[59:15] this, what will they think of us? And so
[59:17] that is Satan's limbo land that he tries
[59:20] to keep people quiet as it is because he
[59:23] does not even want to hear the name of
[59:25] Jesus Christ proclaimed. But as we start
[59:28] to proclaim what changed your life,
[59:30] Jesus Christ, what healed you, Jesus
[59:33] Christ, where is you going in the
[59:35] presence of Jesus Christ? And they are
[59:38] going to ultimately judge you uh from
[59:41] whatever anointing is upon them. In
[59:44] other words, let me I I don't mean to
[59:45] personalize this, but I've got friends
[59:47] that think when it comes to religion,
[59:49] I'm a little bit wacky, but they like me
[59:51] as a person. And so, I still have
[59:53] interaction. And as they are there, it
[59:56] is affecting them more and more. As I am
[59:58] there talking to them, uh uh they they
[1:00:01] go to say a word and they stop. And I I
[1:00:04] don't know why they blame this on the
[1:00:06] French, but some of you will know what
[1:00:08] statement I'm going to say here. And
[1:00:10] they say, "Pardon my French."
[1:00:13] Well, that don't sound like French. That
[1:00:14] sounds like a curse word. But you see,
[1:00:17] they become cognizant now. These same
[1:00:20] people I'm speaking of, they don't even
[1:00:22] say the word. They just like, uh,
[1:00:24] anyway, um, let me reword that. You see,
[1:00:27] because God's causing them to respect
[1:00:30] himself in you. In other words, they
[1:00:34] think they're respecting you, but it the
[1:00:36] truth is they're actually respecting God
[1:00:38] in you. And so you live and I can say
[1:00:41] this. I live in a farming world and
[1:00:44] farming's has produced people very
[1:00:47] religious. They'll pray for rain or
[1:00:50] they'll pray for the lack of rain, but
[1:00:52] they never go to church, work seven days
[1:00:54] a week and say it's their job's fault.
[1:00:56] My brother and sister, you know, it's
[1:00:58] just an anointing of the age to keep
[1:01:00] them out of the house of God. So these
[1:01:03] people that God is bringing forth, they
[1:01:05] have an allegiance. And that allegiance,
[1:01:08] my brother and sister, is not to Grace
[1:01:10] Tabernacle, not to any other church, not
[1:01:12] to a preacher. That allegiance is to the
[1:01:14] word of God, to Jesus Christ himself.
[1:01:16] And and I believe that sounds like us,
[1:01:18] does it not? That we're standing here
[1:01:20] today. It is not that the the church,
[1:01:22] our great choir. In fact, uh, let me
[1:01:24] just throw this in. I asked Sister Jerry
[1:01:26] this morning, sisters
[1:01:29] especially, I asked Jerry, why does no
[1:01:32] one sing a special around our church?
[1:01:35] Maybe some of you could answer that
[1:01:36] question for me or maybe some of you
[1:01:39] could just solve the problem. Uh,
[1:01:42] however you would choose to look at
[1:01:43] that. But you look at this, my brother
[1:01:45] and sister. See what God recognizes. We
[1:01:49] can come and we can quote scripture and
[1:01:52] we can quote the message, but God
[1:01:55] recognizes faith. Amen. So now if you
[1:01:58] really have faith a belief in the
[1:02:01] message in the scripture then you act on
[1:02:05] it. Amen. So it's not just how much we
[1:02:08] can quote to be able to say brother
[1:02:10] Brandham said or the scripture says but
[1:02:13] to be acting on it. Let us be a church.
[1:02:15] Could we be a church in action? Amen.
[1:02:18] One that just hears the word and we say
[1:02:20] you know what uh Lord I I don't need to
[1:02:22] boast to anybody. I don't need to do
[1:02:24] anything. Just let me act on the word.
[1:02:26] And the action that we have on the word
[1:02:29] will speak louder than our own words.
[1:02:32] Amen. People will recognize that you are
[1:02:35] there. And and we'll look all through
[1:02:37] the ages. Every church age coming right
[1:02:39] here, Leodysa is uh is the same exact
[1:02:43] every age. We can go back through the
[1:02:45] word of God and we can see what God
[1:02:48] required. Revelations 2 and three give
[1:02:51] that. And as we touched in youth group
[1:02:54] on that Ephesians uh to Ephesus there uh
[1:02:58] you know his indictment to them is you
[1:03:01] left your first love. So they had an
[1:03:05] action but it was actually moving away
[1:03:07] from the word. It was not an action that
[1:03:10] drew them into the word but they were
[1:03:12] moving away from the word and yet still
[1:03:15] confessed that they believe confessed
[1:03:17] that it was true. confessed all of these
[1:03:19] things, but they actually were leaving
[1:03:21] their first love. And so, we'll see
[1:03:24] that, and I'm not going to go through
[1:03:25] each one, but as we look at Revelations
[1:03:28] 2 and 3, we'll see that that it gives an
[1:03:31] very accurate description of every
[1:03:34] single church age and the actions that
[1:03:37] took place in that day. And now we can
[1:03:41] look at at at Revelations 3 and look at
[1:03:44] Leodysa and and it says and and I I'm
[1:03:47] just going to be honest with you, okay?
[1:03:48] There's no use all us acting super
[1:03:50] spiritual. The very influence of Leodysa
[1:03:54] is upon us. And what was
[1:03:58] that? Lukewarm.
[1:04:01] See how that affects us? I'm not here to
[1:04:04] condemn you, judge you. I'm affected by
[1:04:06] it myself. You see, but it's God's
[1:04:09] warning to you and I that we can come in
[1:04:12] this day and you know if you if you know
[1:04:15] that a thief is coming in the night, you
[1:04:17] look for the thief. But yet, my brother
[1:04:20] and sister, the very natural thing is
[1:04:22] after a while we sleep and we
[1:04:26] slumber and the thief comes when we're
[1:04:28] asleep. And that's what Satan's trying
[1:04:30] to do is doing in this age. He's putting
[1:04:33] many people that know better, good
[1:04:35] people, godly people. But the spirit of
[1:04:38] the age pressing in. I don't know. Have
[1:04:41] any of you experienced any stress
[1:04:43] lately? Amen. I'm glad. Amen. I actually
[1:04:47] am glad. Because we need to not be
[1:04:50] comfortable in Leodysia. If we become
[1:04:54] comfortable here, we will be asleep when
[1:04:56] the call is made, behold the bridegroom
[1:04:59] cometh. We'll be asleep and not realize
[1:05:01] that our lamp has completely burnt out.
[1:05:03] Lord, help us to be aware, to be
[1:05:06] cognizant of the age that we're living
[1:05:09] in and to come into the place that while
[1:05:12] we still suffer the effects, can someone
[1:05:15] say amen? We suffer the effects of
[1:05:17] Leodysa, but God keeps reminding, he
[1:05:20] keeps stirring us and he keeps bringing
[1:05:22] it to our remembrance that we stand here
[1:05:25] today and we know the ws of the enemy.
[1:05:28] The prophet speaks of that. You can look
[1:05:30] it up. To know the ws of the enemy is to
[1:05:34] understand how the enemy is trying to
[1:05:37] deceive you. Amen. And one of the things
[1:05:40] that Satan hates is to actually see the
[1:05:43] manifestation of Christ being lifted up
[1:05:46] in this day. We can look back through
[1:05:49] the other six church ages. We can see
[1:05:51] the blessing. We can see the failure. We
[1:05:54] can see all of that. But God, help us to
[1:05:56] recognize that this is the day that some
[1:06:00] people on the earth are called to lift
[1:06:03] Christ up. And he says, "If I be lifted
[1:06:06] up," now we understand the scripture. He
[1:06:08] was actually talking about his death,
[1:06:10] his crucifixion, and the resurrection.
[1:06:12] But my brother and sister, we take it as
[1:06:14] a prophet brought it in those ter uh
[1:06:16] simple terms that somebody is going to
[1:06:19] be lifting up Christ in this day. Lord,
[1:06:23] I'm going to lift my hand and say, Lord,
[1:06:24] I want to be one of those that is
[1:06:27] lifting you up. Amen. I don't want to
[1:06:29] just look out and say, "My pastor will
[1:06:31] do that job for me. The spiritual men
[1:06:34] will do that job for me." When the
[1:06:35] evangelist comes, he'll do that for us.
[1:06:38] No, my brother and sister, God called
[1:06:40] you and I to be the one today to be
[1:06:42] lifting up the Lord Jesus Christ. Amen.
[1:06:46] And so, God recognizes faith, right? the
[1:06:48] prophet of God teaches us people
[1:06:50] understand
[1:06:52] uh divine healing and people would
[1:06:55] understand that that that something's
[1:06:57] happening you know and and we'll look at
[1:07:00] this and see how the prophet brings it
[1:07:01] about because there'll be many brother
[1:07:04] Brown says many a godly
[1:07:07] sister and she doesn't receive her
[1:07:09] healing and then someone would come in
[1:07:12] off of the street that does not seem to
[1:07:15] meet our idea of the one that God would
[1:07:18] honor their prayer and they receive
[1:07:20] their healing. And then brother Brandham
[1:07:22] goes on, you remember when he's talking
[1:07:24] about this. Amen. He goes on to say it's
[1:07:27] because we have put so many, these are
[1:07:30] my words, we put so many things. Well,
[1:07:32] you know, if I this and if I that and
[1:07:35] and if I'm just the best Christian and
[1:07:38] if I'm just this, then God will hear my
[1:07:40] prayer. And that one that woman off the
[1:07:43] street, she comes and says, "God said
[1:07:44] he's my healer. I believe it." Amen.
[1:07:48] No baggage behind it. Just God said it
[1:07:51] and something sparks my heart. I believe
[1:07:53] it. And God looks down and says, "I I I
[1:07:57] um um honor your faith. I honor that."
[1:08:02] And yet we're over here saying, um they
[1:08:04] weren't dressed proper. They cut their
[1:08:06] hair. They wear makeup. They And and
[1:08:09] we're putting all this baggage onto the
[1:08:12] the things that Lord, I'm doing this
[1:08:14] right. How about we just do it right and
[1:08:16] believe? Amen. Amen. There's a reason
[1:08:18] the prophet of God chose only believe as
[1:08:20] a theme song. Amen. Not only believe
[1:08:23] plus how long is your skirt? Only
[1:08:26] believe. How tall is your heels? Only
[1:08:28] believe. No, my brother and sister. He
[1:08:30] brought us to a place trying to convey
[1:08:32] to us. Only believe. You give it to God.
[1:08:35] Let God deal with the rest of it. Amen.
[1:08:38] But we're fixers. I was talking to a
[1:08:40] brother on the phone. Amen. From
[1:08:44] overseas. and uh he made a comment. He's
[1:08:48] not a pastor or anything, but he he
[1:08:49] works amongst the youth a lot. And he
[1:08:51] says, "Brother Paul, one of the hardest
[1:08:53] things I've had to overcome dealing with
[1:08:56] young people, the fixer in me comes out,
[1:09:01] and I want to fix these young people."
[1:09:06] And then I realized, oh, I'm doing that
[1:09:08] to
[1:09:09] myself. I I'm just going to fix myself.
[1:09:17] Young
[1:09:18] people, hear me
[1:09:20] today. Only believe. Amen.
[1:09:24] You confess your love to the Lord and
[1:09:26] you believe and God will fix every
[1:09:28] single thing that you can't fix
[1:09:31] yourself.
[1:09:33] But if we don't believe, it don't matter
[1:09:34] how much word we read, quote, etc. If we
[1:09:38] don't believe, it won't happen. And
[1:09:41] there's a lot of things that we think we
[1:09:43] got to fill in the blanks when
[1:09:47] actually God said, you know, you've
[1:09:49] you've been to the bank, maybe signed
[1:09:51] some papers for something and and uh I
[1:09:54] think it's funny because u they've quit
[1:09:56] doing it, but Sister Jerry and I through
[1:09:58] the years have have visited the bank
[1:10:00] quite often to borrow money. I'm not
[1:10:03] proud of that. It's just a fact. And uh
[1:10:05] the secretary that we deal with now, she
[1:10:08] used to put these little
[1:10:10] arrows everywhere we're supposed to
[1:10:12] sign, she used to stick those sign here,
[1:10:14] sign here, sign here, sign here. And in
[1:10:18] spite of that, Brother Paul has managed
[1:10:20] through the years to sign on the
[1:10:22] banker's line a time or
[1:10:24] two. I don't know if I thought I was
[1:10:27] going to fix it. Maybe I had a secret
[1:10:29] dream to be a banker. But you see, we
[1:10:32] don't want to make the mistake of I'm
[1:10:35] going to fix it when God says that's
[1:10:37] where I sign. Yeah. Amen. You You can't
[1:10:42] sign that. You can't do that. Just like
[1:10:45] I can't sign these papers at the bank
[1:10:47] that authorize the distribution of this
[1:10:50] money. It will do no good that I sign on
[1:10:53] that line.
[1:10:55] And we're over here signing on the line.
[1:10:58] I can fix it. I can fix it. God wants a
[1:11:01] sign on the line. I believe it, Lord.
[1:11:04] It's right here in your word. I sign my
[1:11:06] name next to your name because I'm
[1:11:08] saying amen to your your word. Amen. So,
[1:11:12] we know this is just simple. Some of
[1:11:14] this we're just we're just stirring up
[1:11:15] pure minds in remembrance this morning.
[1:11:18] God recognizes faith. Amen. And so, we
[1:11:21] know that faith cometh by hearing the
[1:11:23] word. And my brother and sister, how you
[1:11:26] choose. This might sound like a cop out
[1:11:28] to you, but it really comes down. It's
[1:11:30] where I stand. Amen. I I could come and
[1:11:34] I can tell you now, uh, you've got to
[1:11:36] this and you got to do that. But I'm
[1:11:38] just going to leave that spot undone.
[1:11:41] And if you really really really want the
[1:11:44] word to come alive in your life, you are
[1:11:47] going to get in the word. Not because
[1:11:50] the pastor said so or brother David
[1:11:53] would say so, but you yourself. So it
[1:11:56] doesn't need to be a long drawn out uh
[1:11:59] explanation of how if you expect to
[1:12:01] receive from God, you need to pray, you
[1:12:03] need to read your Bible, you need to do
[1:12:05] this, you need to do that. Let the
[1:12:06] desire of your heart drive you to where
[1:12:09] you want to be. If you just want to come
[1:12:12] to church to satisfy a spirit, then so
[1:12:15] be it. I couldn't change that if I
[1:12:17] wanted to. But if you're hungry, then
[1:12:19] don't let anyone else, including the
[1:12:22] church, stop you from feeding on the
[1:12:24] word of God. Well, our our pastor isn't
[1:12:27] a very deep preacher, but that wasn't
[1:12:29] who God said would lead you and guide
[1:12:32] you into all truth. Didn't say your
[1:12:34] pastor will. Now, the brother Brandon
[1:12:36] says now f follow your pastor. Stay with
[1:12:38] him. He's ordained to lead you to truth.
[1:12:40] But your revelation, my brother and
[1:12:42] sister, are you with me? Your revelation
[1:12:44] is not based, maybe you've got a real
[1:12:47] simple pastor, and I think you do. But
[1:12:49] my brother and sister, your revelation
[1:12:51] is not based entirely upon the pastor.
[1:12:54] They say, "Well, you'll only go as high
[1:12:56] as your pastor." Well, my brother and
[1:12:58] sister, that might be true in a sense,
[1:13:01] but I'm telling you, I've seen and met
[1:13:03] and fellowshipped with many a son or
[1:13:05] daughter of God that understand the word
[1:13:08] and maybe understand it better than
[1:13:10] their pastor. But I'll tell you why. You
[1:13:12] could say that they'll not be limited by
[1:13:15] their pastor. because their pastor wants
[1:13:17] to be led by the Holy Ghost. And that's
[1:13:19] the ultimate yard stick that we are
[1:13:21] measured with. It's not the explanation
[1:13:23] of quotes and of doctrines and all of
[1:13:26] this, which is how people interpreted
[1:13:28] what brother Brandham said. Amen. They
[1:13:30] took it like, well, we could never
[1:13:32] explain the seals because our pastor
[1:13:34] struggles to explain the seals. We
[1:13:36] couldn't do that. No, my brother and
[1:13:38] sister, if there's no Holy Spirit in the
[1:13:40] church, you're going to be so stunted.
[1:13:42] But if the Holy Spirit has come, whether
[1:13:45] the pastor's got an IQ of a stick or
[1:13:47] whether he is, you might say, a
[1:13:49] brilliant studied man, my brother and
[1:13:51] sister, none of that matters. If the
[1:13:53] Holy Ghost is not there, you are going
[1:13:55] to be a Amen.
[1:13:59] And that's why that we want to come and
[1:14:01] not put emphasis on knowledge of this
[1:14:03] message, but we want to put emphasis on
[1:14:06] the presence of the Holy Ghost in our
[1:14:08] midst. Amen. And there should be no
[1:14:10] limiting factor on that. Amen. Now, do
[1:14:14] you believe God's confirmed his word to
[1:14:16] every generation?
[1:14:19] He said he did and we can believe that.
[1:14:21] But look at this. God confirming his
[1:14:23] word to every generation. And look,
[1:14:26] every generation uh which includes as it
[1:14:29] were the people uh not just uh not a
[1:14:32] time on a calendar. Every generation's
[1:14:34] been given opportunity to place value on
[1:14:38] the word for their
[1:14:42] day. How much value have we placed on
[1:14:45] the message for this
[1:14:48] day? Now we live in houses, we have
[1:14:53] family
[1:14:54] etc. But when we see the value we placed
[1:14:57] on this is actually causing a separation
[1:15:00] in our life. And if you can't look back
[1:15:03] in your life and see a separation, then
[1:15:05] I would encourage you to get serious and
[1:15:08] pray and you say, "But I still talk to
[1:15:10] my family that are not believers. I
[1:15:12] still No, that's not what it's talking
[1:15:13] about. It's talking in the spiritual
[1:15:15] context, my brother and sister." Amen.
[1:15:18] In fact, the greatest witness that we
[1:15:20] have usually is our life before our
[1:15:22] family.
[1:15:24] Sometimes we just mess it all up by
[1:15:27] opening our mouth.
[1:15:30] Seriously. Yes, sir. Sometimes we need
[1:15:32] to just live what we believe and just
[1:15:36] cut the conversation and let your life
[1:15:39] testify because it will testify louder
[1:15:43] than your words will. And so it's in
[1:15:46] that realm right there that sometimes we
[1:15:48] we would do well just to be silent.
[1:15:50] Amen. So we're seeing that every
[1:15:53] generation has placed a value on the
[1:15:55] word for its generation. And here again
[1:15:58] want to come back just use the dark ages
[1:16:00] as an example. Uh some very brutal
[1:16:03] history. And one of the stories that
[1:16:05] touches my heart was they took and they
[1:16:08] took this whole group men and women and
[1:16:10] children Christians and stripped them
[1:16:12] naked and forced them out into the
[1:16:15] middle of a frozen lake. They're out
[1:16:17] there. It's winter. It's cold. They now
[1:16:20] have no shoes. The cold I don't know
[1:16:23] about you. You know, I've made a mistake
[1:16:25] a time or two. you know, in the winter
[1:16:26] time to think somehow I could run down
[1:16:28] the sidewalk and get something out of my
[1:16:30] pickup. Yeah. Just that, you know, here
[1:16:33] to the back and back again and, you
[1:16:36] know, it takes two hours for your feet
[1:16:37] to warm up. They heard them out there
[1:16:40] naked, which is one humiliation.
[1:16:45] And when you read the scripture and it
[1:16:47] says that they're blind and naked and
[1:16:50] don't even know it, they're actually
[1:16:52] humiliating themselves
[1:16:55] and don't even realize. But here is this
[1:16:58] soldier watching them driven on the ice.
[1:17:01] You know this story, don't you? Amen.
[1:17:04] Driven on the ice and he's standing
[1:17:06] there watching that. And they didn't all
[1:17:09] walk by him and say, you know, you need
[1:17:12] to be saved. You're going to hell.
[1:17:14] accept the message of the
[1:17:16] hour. But he watched
[1:17:19] them and next thing you know, he's
[1:17:21] taking off his big thick coat. He's
[1:17:24] unbuckling his armor. He's doing that.
[1:17:27] And his fellow soldiers, what are you
[1:17:29] doing? And he says, "I believe." Amen.
[1:17:34] No church services, no drawn out
[1:17:36] witness, no literature piled up on top
[1:17:39] of desk collecting dusk. He saw a life.
[1:17:42] Amen. He saw lives that they were
[1:17:44] willing to give their life for the
[1:17:47] gospel. That is really incredible. Now
[1:17:51] the Lord may never require you and I to
[1:17:53] come to anything anywhere close in a
[1:17:56] physical realm as
[1:17:58] that. But we have to give our life.
[1:18:01] Amen. Without giving our life, Amen. we
[1:18:04] will labor in vain all the days of our
[1:18:07] life. Because God doesn't want to own
[1:18:09] just part of you.
[1:18:11] He wants to own you. That's right. In
[1:18:15] fact, there's a title deed been signed
[1:18:17] in his own blood that declares we belong
[1:18:21] to him.
[1:18:25] So, we'll see this. I want to ask you a
[1:18:28] question. Has Jesus Christ been
[1:18:30] confirmed in our lives? I I stand here
[1:18:33] today and say absolutely without a doubt
[1:18:36] uh he's confirmed. I may be not always
[1:18:39] the best example. Amen. There might be
[1:18:42] times, you know, that that under stress
[1:18:44] and under this and under that, uh, you
[1:18:46] know, and and you wonder about stress.
[1:18:48] I'll just throw a side note in here. So,
[1:18:50] in in the situation of my life, I
[1:18:53] finally pulled my head out of the sand.
[1:18:54] I'm doing everything I can uh put my
[1:18:57] blood sugar in order. Uh, you know, if
[1:19:00] the Lord carries another 20 years, I I
[1:19:02] want to be around maybe even to hug a
[1:19:04] great grandchild or whatever the Lord
[1:19:07] might do. And and so, you know, I I've
[1:19:09] started wearing one of those. It's
[1:19:11] called the Libra. And uh you might
[1:19:14] wonder why Paul has his phone right here
[1:19:16] on on the on the pulpit with him. Is
[1:19:18] because if I get too far away from this,
[1:19:21] and I want to take this into a spiritual
[1:19:23] example. I get too far away from this,
[1:19:26] it starts screaming. Amen. You guys
[1:19:28] might have here a few services ago, I
[1:19:30] think right before we went to South
[1:19:32] Africa. I know some of you kept turning
[1:19:34] your hairs like, "What am I hearing?" It
[1:19:36] was laying on the desk in the office in
[1:19:38] [Music]
[1:19:40] there and I was like, "Oh my, what have
[1:19:43] I done? What did I do wrong? Blood
[1:19:45] sugar's too high. Blood sugar's too low.
[1:19:47] Blood sugar doesn't
[1:19:50] exist." Jerry's like, "Yeah, you're too
[1:19:53] far from your phone."
[1:19:56] And so you see what I have now is
[1:20:00] something that constantly affirms to me
[1:20:04] whether I'm feeding on the right thing
[1:20:07] or not. Yes, sir.
[1:20:10] Now, please don't judge me at the next
[1:20:12] fellowship, okay? I'm still just a
[1:20:15] sinner saved by
[1:20:17] grace. the youth meeting the other
[1:20:19] night. I looked out there and I promise
[1:20:23] you those Oreos were calling my name. I
[1:20:27] had to respond. But I tell you what, I
[1:20:29] had the proof right after that. I was
[1:20:32] feeding on the wrong thing. And we have
[1:20:35] in our lives, saints, a very evidence
[1:20:38] that comes of what we're feeding on.
[1:20:40] That's right. Got marriage problems,
[1:20:43] argument in the house. Why don't you
[1:20:45] both stop? Amen. I'm preaching to Paul
[1:20:47] and Jerry, too. And let's look at what
[1:20:50] we've been feeding on. So, I'll get to
[1:20:52] my point here. I got up the other
[1:20:54] morning. Sister Jerry fixed me an
[1:20:55] absolute healthy a breakfast as you can
[1:20:58] ever eat as a human. And I went to work
[1:21:00] and in less than two hours later, my
[1:21:03] blood sugar had two and a half times
[1:21:06] higher. And I I I just put a question to
[1:21:09] Sister Jerry, how can this be? We can
[1:21:11] call it the dawn phenomena. You can do a
[1:21:14] lot of things. And then Sister Jerry's
[1:21:16] like, "Oh,
[1:21:17] remember
[1:21:20] stress. Oh,
[1:21:23] stress. I know none of you have any
[1:21:26] stress in your
[1:21:27] life, but have you ever made a bad
[1:21:30] decision because of stress? Someone
[1:21:32] says, "I want you to do this. I want you
[1:21:35] to agree to this. I want and and we find
[1:21:38] ourselves pushed by stress and and
[1:21:41] pressure and and we respond in a way
[1:21:44] that we shouldn't. And my brother and
[1:21:46] sister, I say, Lord, help us that we
[1:21:49] don't want to lift up a job, amen, a
[1:21:52] marital situation, a family situation
[1:21:56] above the word of God. When we lift
[1:21:59] those things above the word, amen, we're
[1:22:02] not lifting up Christ. We're lifting up
[1:22:04] our carnal situations. And God wants you
[1:22:07] and I to lay down. I know it's hard. I'm
[1:22:10] saying this to encourage you. God wants
[1:22:13] us to lay down every carnal earthly
[1:22:16] thing and lift him up. And when we lift
[1:22:20] him up, blood pressure goes down,
[1:22:22] migraines go down, all of these issues
[1:22:24] all go down when we lift him up. But
[1:22:27] when we lift up our world carnal things
[1:22:30] and our opinions and our attitudes and
[1:22:33] our whatever then suddenly our temples
[1:22:35] are pounding our heart is pounding we
[1:22:38] have the sweat and we can't agree on
[1:22:41] anything. If the wife says you want to
[1:22:43] eat supper no I don't want to eat supper
[1:22:45] 15 minutes later what's for supper. You
[1:22:48] see it's causing us to react in a way
[1:22:51] God never designed you and I to react.
[1:22:54] He said take it to the altar. Lay it
[1:22:56] down. Leave it there. Oh. Oh. Would you
[1:23:00] pray for me for healing? Look, sister,
[1:23:04] you need to have faith. You're already
[1:23:06] healed. Amen. See, but the pressures of
[1:23:10] the age cause us to think there's got to
[1:23:13] be another solution besides the solution
[1:23:16] that God offered us. And if we'll lift
[1:23:18] him up, he's got an answer for
[1:23:21] everything. We don't need someone else's
[1:23:23] opinion. Amen. We don't need some
[1:23:26] outside influence. We need to just give
[1:23:29] room for the Lord to have influence in
[1:23:31] our lives. Amen. I say Jesus Christ has
[1:23:35] been confirmed in our lives. Not as
[1:23:37] history, but he's here as a present
[1:23:40] savior, present healer, a present
[1:23:42] provider, a present comforter. Amen. And
[1:23:46] I'm going to say absolutely today he's
[1:23:48] been confirmed as our comforter.
[1:23:51] Oh, when life gets stressful, we got to
[1:23:54] stop and say, "Lord, point me back to
[1:23:56] the one that is greater than I." Amen.
[1:23:59] Higher than I. Point me to the rock,
[1:24:02] Lord.
[1:24:12] sermon uh confirmation and
[1:24:17] evidence. Now, please follow this. I
[1:24:19] would encourage you to just uh because
[1:24:21] you could if you don't have a note to
[1:24:22] write it down on, you always can go back
[1:24:24] and find it. Uh I think this is just an
[1:24:27] awesome quote.
[1:24:29] So you see alto together I made a remark
[1:24:33] if I had two drops of the literal blood
[1:24:37] of Jesus in a
[1:24:39] glass how I would hold it to my heart
[1:24:42] and weep stand there watching that I
[1:24:47] didn't stumble to spill it as I walked
[1:24:50] with it wherever I was destined to go
[1:24:53] with it. how I would watch every step
[1:24:56] that I wouldn't stumble, placing my feet
[1:24:58] just where they should be. And I
[1:25:00] thought, how I would hold those two
[1:25:03] drops of blood, but you know, now get
[1:25:06] this. But you know, in the sight of God
[1:25:08] tonight, setting before me is a greater
[1:25:12] thing to him than his own blood.
[1:25:15] Oh my, my brother and sister. I love how
[1:25:18] the prophet brings this out. Something
[1:25:20] greater. We would, I believe, sitting
[1:25:22] here tonight. Amen. You know, we were in
[1:25:24] Belgium. Amen. And there's a place
[1:25:26] there. It's a Catholic uh h um I don't
[1:25:29] know even what you call a shrine. And
[1:25:31] they claim that they have the literal
[1:25:35] blood of Jesus Christ.
[1:25:37] It takes you back to the quote where
[1:25:39] Brother Brandham says about how that
[1:25:42] these guys claim they have the spikes
[1:25:44] and these guys claim they have the
[1:25:46] spikes and these guys claim they have
[1:25:48] the spikes. And brother Brown says that
[1:25:50] means there's like five or six sets of
[1:25:52] spikes out
[1:25:53] here. One crucifixion produced five or
[1:25:57] six sets of spikes. My brother and
[1:25:59] sister, they're there saying, "Oh, come
[1:26:00] in here. Drop your money in the box.
[1:26:03] Come witness the literal blood of Jesus
[1:26:06] Christ." My brother and sister, what
[1:26:09] nonsense.
[1:26:10] What nonsense there was. See, one in
[1:26:14] that day of the crucifixion, they placed
[1:26:17] not one drop of value on the literal
[1:26:20] blood of Jesus Christ. No one was out
[1:26:23] there saying, "Oh, somebody grab a pan
[1:26:26] and catch this blood cuz it's going to
[1:26:29] one day be uh proven to be valuable."
[1:26:32] So, the prophet here speaking, let me
[1:26:34] get back focused. Amen. Sitting before
[1:26:37] me is a greater thing to him than his
[1:26:39] own blood because it's the purchase
[1:26:43] of his blood. Hallelujah. Now, let me
[1:26:46] drive that home in a natural thing. I
[1:26:47] don't know each of you just think about
[1:26:49] something that you spent a reasonable
[1:26:51] amount of money on lately. Reasonable is
[1:26:53] more than
[1:26:54] $5. Amen. Maybe add a couple three more
[1:26:56] zeros or something. You realize that
[1:27:00] 5,000 you had in your hand,
[1:27:03] you deemed something else more valuable
[1:27:08] than that 5,000 in your hand.
[1:27:12] and you spent it. That's it. So now when
[1:27:15] you look at that, you can say I spent
[1:27:16] exactly 5,000 on
[1:27:18] this. So it's equal to the money I had
[1:27:23] in my
[1:27:24] hand. I can write on my financial
[1:27:27] statement. I don't know what are we
[1:27:29] going to
[1:27:33] use.
[1:27:35] Tractor. You don't buy much of a
[1:27:37] tractor. You buy one wheel on a tractor
[1:27:39] for 5,000. How about 500,000? 500,000.
[1:27:43] Okay. Brother David's asking we raise
[1:27:45] the
[1:27:46] limit. But what whatever it might be, I
[1:27:49] don't
[1:27:49] know. This this antique clock. And and
[1:27:55] so really the truth of it is the antique
[1:27:57] clock is not equal to the 5000. It's
[1:28:02] actually greater because you were
[1:28:05] willing to give the 5,000 because this
[1:28:08] had more intrinsic value to you. Amen.
[1:28:15] And Jesus Christ spilled his blood for
[1:28:17] you and I. Amen. Oh, we don't look at it
[1:28:20] as a couple drops of blood that covered
[1:28:22] our sin. My brother and sister, let's
[1:28:23] look at it in this real spiritual
[1:28:26] economics. God said, "You are greater
[1:28:29] than my blood." That's right. And I will
[1:28:32] pour out my blood for you. Amen. He was
[1:28:36] looking not at a equal trade. He was not
[1:28:40] looking at what he called a bargain. He
[1:28:42] said, "That's worth more to me." And the
[1:28:45] prophet of God, I believe, lays this out
[1:28:47] so p perfect. Yeah. Perfectly. Amen. He
[1:28:51] shed his blood for you. And here I hold
[1:28:54] you and listening tonight of the gospel.
[1:28:56] then how close I must be to tell you
[1:28:59] exactly the truth. Because God will make
[1:29:01] me answer for it at the day of judgment
[1:29:04] more than if I took the blood, the
[1:29:06] literal blood, and threw it on the
[1:29:08] ground. It would be greater penalty to
[1:29:10] mislead the people, the purchase of his
[1:29:13] blood, than it would be to throw the
[1:29:15] blood from the charger that I had it in.
[1:29:17] Amen. Are we following that? Amen. God
[1:29:20] would say, "Look, I purchased them."
[1:29:23] Amen. and you deceive them.
[1:29:27] Oh my. Yeah. Oh my. Prophet's driving a
[1:29:31] point home. I'm sure somebody would find
[1:29:32] some argument with it, but I believe we
[1:29:34] see it today. How valuable God has
[1:29:37] placed the value he's placed on you and
[1:29:40] I today. Amen. Should we not Amen. We'll
[1:29:44] get there in a second if I'll get going.
[1:29:46] But should we not be able whether you
[1:29:49] know I I I'm going to put you to your
[1:29:51] feet to the fire. How many times have we
[1:29:53] come to church? We didn't feel like
[1:29:54] coming to church. And it influenced us
[1:29:57] the whole church service. I wish the
[1:29:59] song service would be just a little
[1:30:00] shorter. Brother Alex could have cut out
[1:30:02] that one song. Amen. You know, uh I wish
[1:30:06] that the preacher had only read a half a
[1:30:09] quote instead of
[1:30:11] three. I w No, that spirit, that
[1:30:15] atmosphere robbed you. Amen. Just like a
[1:30:18] robber with a mask and a gun robbed you.
[1:30:22] Amen. That's it. And that was our
[1:30:24] emotion. Oh, no. No. You don't
[1:30:26] understand. I had a physical physical
[1:30:30] symptom. Praise God. You know what the
[1:30:32] prophet God said about that? When you're
[1:30:34] sick, there's no better place to be than
[1:30:36] the house of God. Now, sure as I say
[1:30:39] that, my brother and sister, I have got
[1:30:41] the man flu before. And I use that word
[1:30:44] because it's used on me. Oh, the man flu
[1:30:46] is always worse than the woman flu.
[1:30:51] I've been there before where I just just
[1:30:53] feel rung out and I just can't I just
[1:30:56] can't feel like I can do that. But I'll
[1:31:00] also tell you just if I can use myself
[1:31:02] trying to break the habit of using all
[1:31:03] of you for the example. There's been
[1:31:06] times I felt so horrible and I came to
[1:31:09] church.
[1:31:11] In fact, it's not been that long ago and
[1:31:13] Brother David was
[1:31:15] preaching. And Brother David preached
[1:31:17] till about 9:30 at night. And I'm not
[1:31:19] bashful to just put that out there. If
[1:31:21] you want to cringe over it, cringe. He
[1:31:24] preached about
[1:31:25] 9:30. Some no doubt thought, "Oh,
[1:31:28] tomorrow's coming quickly." I'll tell
[1:31:30] you, I walked out of church happy
[1:31:32] because by 9:30, 7:30 to 9:30, I walked
[1:31:36] out without a single symptom of sickness
[1:31:39] in my body.
[1:31:40] of the Lord. I would trade that any day,
[1:31:42] my brother and sister. Or I could sit
[1:31:45] and complain and decide I can't do it
[1:31:46] and go home early and be sick all night
[1:31:49] long and maybe not work the next day or
[1:31:51] whatever. You see, God's not wanting us,
[1:31:53] my brother and sister, to lift ourself
[1:31:56] up. He wants us to lift him up. And when
[1:31:59] we come and say, you know what? Truly,
[1:32:01] the Lord is my healer. He's my guide.
[1:32:04] He's my sword, my shield, my buckler.
[1:32:06] He's everything to me. God says,
[1:32:08] "There's my son. There's my daughter
[1:32:10] lifting me up, putting me in a position
[1:32:14] above Leodysia, above the pharmacy.
[1:32:25] Hallelujah. I've lost
[1:32:28] myself." So, how close I must be to tell
[1:32:31] you exactly the truth because God will
[1:32:33] make me answer for it on the day of
[1:32:34] judgment. more than if I took the blood,
[1:32:37] the literal blood, and threw it on the
[1:32:41] ground. That's how much he values you.
[1:32:47] Hallelujah. Can someone say, "Thank you,
[1:32:49] Lord." Yep. Yep. I think it's a very
[1:32:53] interesting point because see, you are
[1:32:55] the purchased. And he's placed a greater
[1:32:57] value on what he purchased than on the
[1:33:00] price that he paid for it. Amen. And we
[1:33:03] look at this as our Lord Jesus Christ
[1:33:05] laid down his life. Amen. Now
[1:33:11] remember as Jesus walked on the earth,
[1:33:15] he dealt in an earthly value. In other
[1:33:19] words, he got hungry. He got tired. He's
[1:33:22] dealing in an earthly value. So we can't
[1:33:25] overspiritualize like him giving his
[1:33:28] life was no big deal. No, my brother and
[1:33:31] sister, he felt pain just like you do.
[1:33:33] He felt the hunger pain just like you
[1:33:35] do. And the stress of who he was and
[1:33:37] what God called him to do. And as he
[1:33:39] looked around and saw those that were
[1:33:41] rejecting the price that was being paid.
[1:33:45] Amen. It must have been a stress beyond
[1:33:47] belief. But yet he said, "I've got to do
[1:33:50] it. I'm not as it were paying a price."
[1:33:53] Now, this is just my words, okay? So
[1:33:55] don't I'm not just paying a price. I'm
[1:33:58] making an investment. Amen. Amen. And
[1:34:01] this is going to increase in value to
[1:34:04] being a soul that would be bound to hell
[1:34:07] to a soul worth 10,000 worlds. You talk
[1:34:11] about an investment. Oh my. Wall Street
[1:34:14] if they had an opportunity to make that
[1:34:16] kind of investment would pour everything
[1:34:19] they've got into that. And God says,
[1:34:21] "That's what I'll do for you. I'm gonna
[1:34:24] I'm gonna do this for you."
[1:34:26] Amen. Here again, kind of being
[1:34:29] redundant. He placed a higher value on
[1:34:31] you. Amen. And this does not lessen the
[1:34:36] value of the blood. That's right. Don't
[1:34:38] go thinking, "Oh, he redeemed me with
[1:34:40] his blood, so the blood really wasn't."
[1:34:43] No, the blood is an incredible
[1:34:47] supernatural value. That's right. And
[1:34:50] that's how much God placed on us. Oh my.
[1:34:53] We should be able to lift him up. Amen.
[1:34:55] Amen. We should be able just hold him.
[1:34:59] Amen. As the highest Hebrews 13 12-16,
[1:35:03] wherefore Jesus always that he might
[1:35:05] sanctify the people with his own blood.
[1:35:08] That's right. Suffered without the gate.
[1:35:10] See, he had to fulfill the scripture, my
[1:35:12] brother and sister. Let us go therefore
[1:35:14] unto him without the camp, bearing his
[1:35:17] reproach. From here we have no
[1:35:20] continuing city, but we seek one to
[1:35:23] come. By him therefore, let us offer the
[1:35:26] sacrifice. Uhoh. That's it. Uhoh.
[1:35:31] Should I rewind? And we I've got another
[1:35:34] scripture I can read.
[1:35:38] Come on, saints. Before I go any
[1:35:40] further, I just want to put this out
[1:35:41] here.
[1:35:43] Too many people think when the preacher
[1:35:45] is saying worship him, give him praise,
[1:35:48] that we're literally trying to get,
[1:35:51] oh, brother Paul wants some affirmation
[1:35:54] that he's that he's saying the right
[1:35:57] thing. Hey, I know my limitations. I
[1:36:00] know that I should right the minute you
[1:36:02] speak it. Oh, should have used that
[1:36:03] word. Right the minute you go through
[1:36:05] something that's like didn't quite
[1:36:06] present that the way I thought it would
[1:36:08] come out. Oh, what about my brother and
[1:36:10] sister? This is not about affirmation
[1:36:12] for the preacher. This is about a son of
[1:36:14] God. Hear me well. It's about a son of
[1:36:16] God anointed to speak the words to you
[1:36:19] to tell you, "Come on, God who paid a
[1:36:22] price with his blood to redeem you, to
[1:36:24] lift you up in value, would like to hear
[1:36:27] you say, "Thank you, Lord. I love you,
[1:36:31] Lord. I want to serve you, Lord." He
[1:36:34] just wants to hear you. It's not the
[1:36:36] preacher. Maybe some are in the flesh
[1:36:38] want to hear that and do that. But my
[1:36:40] brother and sister, it's an
[1:36:41] encouragement. Break us out of our rut,
[1:36:44] Lord. Break us out of our limitation,
[1:36:46] Lord. Let us lift our voices and give
[1:36:49] praise to you. Not stand here and say,
[1:36:51] "Yeah, that's the truth. Yeah, that's
[1:36:53] the truth. That's what the prophet said.
[1:36:56] Yeah, that's the truth." What about you?
[1:36:59] Amen. What about you, my brother and
[1:37:01] sister? Amen. Let me just throw this in.
[1:37:04] The 10 vision, people thought it had to
[1:37:06] come to pass in a physical realm. The
[1:37:08] prophet of God went for many years
[1:37:09] believing they were buying a tent and
[1:37:11] going to drive around the country. Had
[1:37:13] the truck lined up, the brother to drive
[1:37:14] the truck around, brothers to put the
[1:37:16] tent up to go around. And then right at
[1:37:19] the end, without bold statement, he
[1:37:21] starts to talk about how that that
[1:37:23] tabernacle is you. Amen. Don't need to
[1:37:27] go to the park and set you up. Amen.
[1:37:31] He's got a habitation and he paid for
[1:37:34] the habitation and he wants to dwell in
[1:37:36] the habitation he paid for. And it's
[1:37:39] there that we come to realize the tent
[1:37:42] vision is you and I in the flesh
[1:37:45] manifested in this day. A living
[1:37:48] tabernacle
[1:37:50] read of all men. Amen. Amen.
[1:37:54] And he says, I'd do it again. I'd pay
[1:37:57] that price for you again, but I don't
[1:37:59] need to. No, one
[1:38:03] mill scoch. I don't know if that's a
[1:38:06] measurement. One millcoso of the blood
[1:38:09] of Jesus Christ seals forever. We don't
[1:38:14] got to run back and get a little bit
[1:38:15] more. Get a little bit more. Get a
[1:38:18] little bit more. What we got to do is
[1:38:19] stay under the blood that he's already
[1:38:22] given us. Amen. Cuz that blood will
[1:38:24] preserve us. It's powerful.
[1:38:27] Hallelujah.
[1:38:29] And the word says they're going to be
[1:38:31] like him. We're going to have his spirit
[1:38:33] and we're going to be
[1:38:36] treasures in earth and vessel. Amen. Why
[1:38:40] would God call us treasure in earth and
[1:38:42] vessel if we had no value? That's it. I
[1:38:46] don't know. Maybe it's just a Did any of
[1:38:47] you read pirate stories when you were a
[1:38:49] kid? I loved pirate stories.
[1:38:55] The
[1:38:56] pirate, he's got all this
[1:38:59] treasure. The smart
[1:39:01] ones didn't go bury it in the sand on
[1:39:04] the shores of
[1:39:07] Florida. They went and put it somewhere
[1:39:10] where they could take good care of
[1:39:13] it. You see, God doesn't want us to just
[1:39:15] say, "I'm so busy in my life, my career,
[1:39:17] my family, my this, my that," that we
[1:39:20] just chunk it down and think we're going
[1:39:21] to come back and pick it up. But the
[1:39:23] sands of the moving of the seashore of
[1:39:26] the waves of life will come back and one
[1:39:28] day they come and say, "I know I got a
[1:39:30] treasure here somewhere. I was raised in
[1:39:33] the message. I was raised in a Christian
[1:39:35] home. I used to serve God. I used to do
[1:39:38] this and I used to do that." And the
[1:39:41] lapping of the waters
[1:39:43] of the cares of life.
[1:39:46] I don't know if you read stuff. Anytime
[1:39:48] I see it, it catches my attention. I
[1:39:50] just read there there's a spot off of a
[1:39:53] I can't even remember the name of the uh
[1:39:55] town right now uh down the beach from
[1:39:57] St. Augustine, Florida. Uh and uh
[1:40:00] there's actually very much documented
[1:40:02] that these ships had been anchored right
[1:40:05] there during a big storm and sank. When
[1:40:07] the morning come, they were no no longer
[1:40:10] there. And um at one point in time, you
[1:40:14] know, the tip of the mast of one of
[1:40:16] those ships, you know, this is 16
[1:40:18] something was sticking up out of the
[1:40:20] water. They knew the ships were there.
[1:40:22] They knew they were full of gold, but
[1:40:24] they were going to wait for another day
[1:40:26] to retrieve
[1:40:27] it. And then the sea destroys all
[1:40:31] evidence. There was a man who did all
[1:40:34] kinds. He's found some treasure because
[1:40:35] he's willing to dig through the history
[1:40:39] of the treasure
[1:40:42] and he took the history of the
[1:40:45] treasure. And then he proceeded to spend
[1:40:48] several million dollars and people are
[1:40:51] like, "You're just stabbing in the
[1:40:52] dark." And he says, "No, the history of
[1:40:55] the treasure says the treasure is
[1:40:57] there." That's right.
[1:40:59] Are you with me, saints? Amen.
[1:41:03] My history of the treasure says it's in
[1:41:05] an earthn vessel. Amen. I'm not going to
[1:41:08] go look at a a gold statue in the
[1:41:10] church. Amen. Have you guys ever been
[1:41:12] there? I don't know, maybe you have, but
[1:41:14] when you go to Belgium, there's some
[1:41:16] humongous, incredible churches. Even my
[1:41:19] voice sounds good in there.
[1:41:22] And there's also another evidence the
[1:41:23] prophet talked about. And we're walking
[1:41:25] through these places. And here's a
[1:41:27] statue of the Apostle Paul. Yeah. man's
[1:41:30] idea of what Apostle Paul looked like.
[1:41:32] But I was
[1:41:34] impressed. And a little note there,
[1:41:36] they've had to replace the foot on the
[1:41:38] Apostle Paul five times. And we're
[1:41:41] standing there and we're witnessing
[1:41:43] people coming up.
[1:41:48] I'm not mocking them. Don't
[1:41:50] misunderstand me. But look how
[1:41:51] misguided. If they would put their hands
[1:41:54] on the word, they would find what they
[1:41:57] were searching for. But they're going to
[1:41:59] a stone statue and they are rubbing it
[1:42:02] and crying out in prayer with bitter
[1:42:05] tears dripping from their faces crying
[1:42:07] out. And I didn't understand the
[1:42:09] language so I don't know what they were
[1:42:10] praying about but I can assure you they
[1:42:12] were sincere.
[1:42:14] Amen. But they failed to realize. Look
[1:42:17] this is why saints people want to say
[1:42:20] well the seventh seal is it really
[1:42:22] important? It is important because you
[1:42:24] have to recognize it's not God in the
[1:42:27] building. It's not God in the statue.
[1:42:30] It's not God in history. It's God in
[1:42:32] you. Amen. Christ in you, the hope of
[1:42:35] glory. Amen. Don't go looking out here
[1:42:38] somewhere for it. Don't go over here. We
[1:42:40] got to go north, south, east, west. We
[1:42:42] got to go. I'm sorry. I'm just going to
[1:42:44] go ahead and say it. I've heard people
[1:42:46] say right to my face. I've got some
[1:42:48] affliction in my body. And we're not
[1:42:50] supposed to cross the chains at brother
[1:42:52] Brandham's tomb, but I'm going to go
[1:42:53] there and I'm going to lay my hand on
[1:42:56] that gravestone. And I believe that's
[1:42:58] going to heal me. My brother and sister,
[1:43:01] if they just lay a hand on the word.
[1:43:03] Amen. And have faith in the word. The
[1:43:06] word would come and heal them. You don't
[1:43:09] have to go and travel somewhere to lay
[1:43:11] your hand on something. Look how it was.
[1:43:14] We know the Apostle Paul just the mere
[1:43:17] shadow falling upon the people. There
[1:43:19] was such a presence of God there. But
[1:43:22] those people, let's not twist this
[1:43:24] around. Those people, just as the
[1:43:26] prophet of God said, it's your faith.
[1:43:30] That shadow fell on people that
[1:43:32] believed.
[1:43:34] They weren't there just, oh, Paul's
[1:43:35] shadow. Incredible.
[1:43:38] No, sir. They believed God was going to
[1:43:40] come and answer their prayer. And he
[1:43:43] did. Hallelujah. We're the ones that get
[1:43:46] it all confused. Now, it's Paul's
[1:43:48] shadow, Paul's handkerchief, Paul's
[1:43:49] this, Paul's that. No, my brother and
[1:43:51] sister, it's faith in God. If we lift
[1:43:55] him up. That's right. He said, "I will
[1:43:58] come." That's right. In your presence.
[1:44:00] That's right. And draw all men unto me.
[1:44:06] Oh, let's go back to this subject that's
[1:44:07] a little bit tough. Amen. Uh by him
[1:44:11] therefore, let us offer the sacrifice of
[1:44:13] praise. This is what God looks like.
[1:44:16] Don't be all sad and teary and boohoo. I
[1:44:18] got to go offer this sacrifice. It
[1:44:19] should be something we have joy in our
[1:44:21] heart. Once again, let me remind you I
[1:44:23] would really appreciate some specials in
[1:44:25] the church. That would make my heart
[1:44:29] happy. I can't do it like the sisters
[1:44:32] and whoever do, but something of this
[1:44:37] order. I hope you don't mind just a tad
[1:44:39] bit of humor. Let the sacrifice of
[1:44:42] praise to God continually, not just in
[1:44:45] church on Sunday or Wednesday.
[1:44:48] That is the fruit of our lips giving
[1:44:51] thanks to his name.
[1:44:54] But to do good and to communicate,
[1:44:56] forget not. For with such sacrifices,
[1:44:59] God is well pleased.
[1:45:02] Amen. Forgive me for implying that. I
[1:45:05] just really honestly from my heart would
[1:45:07] just love to see more specials.
[1:45:09] Now, acknowledgement that God sees your
[1:45:12] praise as a sacrifice and honors it. It
[1:45:15] makes him happy. to see our sacrifice of
[1:45:19] praise and uh you know it's there
[1:45:22] that is important enough. He mentions
[1:45:25] it. Amen. He ties it right in the word.
[1:45:28] It's important enough. If it didn't
[1:45:29] matter, saints, he wouldn't bother to
[1:45:31] put in his word. And if it's in his
[1:45:33] word, we shouldn't look at it like, nah,
[1:45:35] it doesn't matter. We should look at it
[1:45:36] and say, you know what, Lord, let us
[1:45:38] praise. Whether it's just church
[1:45:39] worship, I'm not I'm I'm I'm going to
[1:45:41] back away from pressure on
[1:45:44] specials except for, you know, Sister
[1:45:46] Gabriella's got a beautiful voice
[1:45:48] whenever she chooses to share it. Um
[1:45:50] anyway, um no, look at this, my brother
[1:45:53] and sister. What God is wanting is our
[1:45:56] continual praise.
[1:46:01] In the good time, that's right, I'll
[1:46:04] praise his name. in the bad times. I'll
[1:46:08] praise his name. It's what he's looking
[1:46:11] for. Okay, I'm going way longer. I
[1:46:15] didn't think I had enough notes to get
[1:46:16] through a service here. He him.
[1:46:19] Amen. And I think that's just about
[1:46:22] where our churches are
[1:46:24] getting. It's pretty rough quote really
[1:46:26] when you look at this. Brother Brown
[1:46:28] just doesn't mince anything. I think
[1:46:30] that's just about where our churches are
[1:46:32] getting. We're children of God, but
[1:46:33] we're losing our inheritance by our
[1:46:35] conduct, the things that we do and the
[1:46:37] things that we permit to be done and the
[1:46:40] way that we live and act and so forth.
[1:46:43] We're living millions of miles below our
[1:46:46] privilege. And then someone can see the
[1:46:49] work of God being done and Dr. So and so
[1:46:51] and Dr. Jones says it's this, the other
[1:46:53] doctor says it's this. And we believe it
[1:46:56] instead of looking into the word. That's
[1:46:59] right. The word verifies that. What's
[1:47:02] sheep food?
[1:47:04] It comes out of the word. Hallelujah. I
[1:47:08] actually have quite a bit more here. So,
[1:47:12] amen. If the musicians would come, would
[1:47:15] appreciate it. Amen. See, the word in us
[1:47:19] gives us the ability to lift Christ
[1:47:21] higher. Amen. Without the word in us, we
[1:47:24] can only lift him so far. We raise him
[1:47:26] as a religious figure. Yeah. Right.
[1:47:29] Amen. That's right. But you know what?
[1:47:31] This is the thing that's so beautiful,
[1:47:33] saints.
[1:47:34] We are by God's grace changing the
[1:47:37] atmosphere around us. Amen. Sometimes we
[1:47:41] think, boy, is it ain't changing fast
[1:47:43] enough for me.
[1:47:46] Well, the word says God's right on time.
[1:47:49] Amen. Lord, don't let us be the ones
[1:47:53] that
[1:47:54] that hold it back. You see, no one said
[1:47:57] it'd be easy. No, sir.
[1:48:00] I'll tell you, my brother and sister,
[1:48:02] just as it
[1:48:05] was, if our eyes were
[1:48:08] opened, there's two things would shock
[1:48:10] us. How many devils there are truly on
[1:48:13] the
[1:48:14] earth would shock us. And it would also
[1:48:18] shock us how many angels were
[1:48:21] surrounding us.
[1:48:24] We look out in the world today and it's
[1:48:25] wicked. It It's
[1:48:27] just unspeakable. The wickedness
[1:48:32] and I you could preach the rest of your
[1:48:34] life on how wicked this world is. But
[1:48:38] that won't change us. Amen. But if we
[1:48:41] focus on our Lord Jesus Christ, we could
[1:48:43] focus the rest of our life on how
[1:48:46] incredible, how wonderful, how precious,
[1:48:49] how gracious and kind he is. We could
[1:48:53] never run out. Let's just choose, Amen.
[1:48:58] to look at our Lord Jesus Christ. And
[1:49:00] while we're looking on him, let us
[1:49:03] choose, to lift him up. Amen. not be
[1:49:07] ashamed to give praise. Worst days of
[1:49:10] our lives, South Africa, I'll be a
[1:49:13] little vague
[1:49:14] here, interacted with with
[1:49:20] brothers and they beared their hearts
[1:49:25] shared talking about discouragement,
[1:49:27] talking about anxieties and
[1:49:32] fears. And then by God's grace, we steer
[1:49:36] the
[1:49:38] conversation. But brother, what has the
[1:49:40] Lord done for you lately? The
[1:49:43] atmosphere changed immediately. That's
[1:49:47] right.
[1:49:48] That's right. Let's get the Lord on the
[1:49:51] scene. Amen. Let the atmosphere change.
[1:49:54] He is my redeemer. That's right. He is
[1:49:57] my savior. He's my all and all. Amen.
[1:50:01] He's my healer.
[1:50:03] I got affliction in my body. He's still
[1:50:05] my healer. I'm having migraines. He's
[1:50:08] still my healer. I can't hardly walk.
[1:50:11] He's still my
[1:50:12] healer. Amen. Amen.
[1:50:16] [Music]
[1:50:22] I'll cut it off right
[1:50:24] there.
[1:50:26] Amen. Things that are to be. You can
[1:50:28] actually go back
[1:50:29] into last couple sermons I've preached.
[1:50:32] I I I won't read it. I'll get
[1:50:34] distracted.
[1:50:36] Um but uh I'll just draw this one line
[1:50:39] out of this quote. Because you have to
[1:50:41] stand and be married to the perfect son
[1:50:43] of God. You must be a perfect bride. And
[1:50:48] the Lord would have never called
[1:50:51] you if he wouldn't perfect you to be
[1:50:54] that bride. Amen. Amen. Let's stand.
[1:50:57] Just worship the Lord a little bit.
[1:50:59] Amen.
[1:51:04] Now, this ties back to that quote, but
[1:51:06] I'll just say it anyway. You can follow
[1:51:07] it. I know you will. From our perfect
[1:51:10] position in Jesus Christ.
[1:51:14] From there, let us lift up the name of
[1:51:16] Jesus. Amen. Not from a
[1:51:20] insufficient. If I was if I was a better
[1:51:23] Christian, if I was a better believer,
[1:51:25] if I was, I would then be able to praise
[1:51:28] God. No, you're in a perfect position.
[1:51:30] He said you were. Just praise him.
[1:51:33] That's right. And that actually will
[1:51:35] draw you into a more perfect position.
[1:51:39] Amen. Not waiting to come there, but go
[1:51:43] there and watch it move you. Amen. God
[1:51:47] bless you today, saints.
[1:51:49] Amen. Number 64, Brother
[1:51:52] Alex.
[1:51:54] Amen. Hallelujah. Can't believe how hard
[1:51:57] a time I found to find this song. I had
[1:52:00] parts of the words I just couldn't even
[1:52:02] figure it out. Wherever I
[1:52:05] go, I'll praise him wherever I
[1:52:09] can. Oh, I'll praise him for his
[1:52:14] love surrounds me like the
[1:52:20] sea. I'll praise the
[1:52:23] name of Jesus. Lift up the
[1:52:27] name of Jesus. For the
[1:52:32] name of Jesus, lifted me. Let's sing it
[1:52:37] again. Wherever I
[1:52:40] go, I'll praise him wherever I
[1:52:45] can. I'll praise him for his
[1:52:49] love surrounds me like a sea.
[1:52:56] I'll praise the
[1:52:58] name of Jesus. I lift up the
[1:53:02] name of Jesus. For the
[1:53:07] name of Jesus lifted me
[1:53:13] 890.
[1:53:15] Hallelujah. Amen. Is it good to be
[1:53:18] Christians? Amen.
[1:53:20] Hallelujah.
[1:53:22] Boy, I might need some help. Brother
[1:53:24] [Music]
[1:53:26] Alex, Lord, my heart can
[1:53:31] grow so far
[1:53:34] away and
[1:53:37] cold. And yet for me, your love is still
[1:53:43] the same. Let's just give him praise
[1:53:45] today, saints.
[1:53:49] Oh Lord, I bend my
[1:53:53] knees in awe and fear of
[1:53:58] thee. My head bow down in reence to your
[1:54:06] [Music]
[1:54:08] name. Lord, I lift your name.
