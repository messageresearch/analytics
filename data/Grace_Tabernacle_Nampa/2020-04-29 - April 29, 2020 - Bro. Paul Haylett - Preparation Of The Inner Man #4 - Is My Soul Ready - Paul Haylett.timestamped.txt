[23:31] I'd die believing the catching away of
[23:38] your pride your living is I believe we
[23:52] can say amen to that tonight hallelujah
[23:54] well I just thought the song service
[23:57] tonight would have been tailor-made if I
[23:59] had shared with brother Jason what I was
[24:02] going to speak on but we haven't talked
[24:05] so I find that interesting amen
[24:09] I'd like to speak to you again
[24:10] preparation of the inner man part for
[24:14] now I have a question to ask tonight and
[24:17] that would be for each one of us if I
[24:21] could impose upon you to ask yourself
[24:23] this question is my soul ready now one
[24:28] might construe that brother Paul would
[24:30] be questioning whether you were ready or
[24:32] not but you see this is something that
[24:35] we need to speak to ourselves each and
[24:38] every day it is something that we need
[24:41] to to hold to a very high level to know
[24:46] that Satan would come he's like a thief
[24:50] and a robber and he would come and he
[24:53] tries to make deposits you might say in
[24:56] the accounts of our lives to influence
[24:59] us to put little things you know
[25:02] bitterness Envy strife pride all of
[25:07] these kind of things that can be in our
[25:10] life sometimes and not be totally
[25:12] evident and so we just take a moment
[25:17] we'll we'll touch on some things in a
[25:20] minute but let's just stand for the
[25:22] reading of the word we want to go to
[25:25] Hebrews the tenth chapter verse 38 and
[25:29] 39 so we're still working out the exact
[25:37] direction that we want to take as the
[25:40] state allows us to
[25:42] start to have church they do have
[25:44] certain guidelines and one of the issues
[25:47] that we have to abide by or should abide
[25:51] by is their social distancing and so we
[25:57] have to do some calculating on how we're
[26:00] going about reopening the church now if
[26:04] it seems like we're dragging our feet
[26:06] I'm not we just want to do the right
[26:09] thing the correct thing amen
[26:12] Hebrews the tenth chapter verse 38 39
[26:15] now the just shall live by faith but if
[26:20] any man draw back my soul shall have no
[26:23] pleasure in him but we are not of them
[26:28] who draw back and we say amen to that we
[26:31] are not of them who draw back into
[26:33] perdition but of them that believe to
[26:36] the saving of the soul Heavenly Father
[26:39] we thank you today Lord for your grace
[26:42] for your mercy for your guiding hand
[26:44] Lord we're asking for wisdom Lord and
[26:47] the days forward father that we would be
[26:50] able to make the right decisions Lord
[26:52] that would be for the benefit of the
[26:54] church the people that would be pleasing
[26:57] also to you for father we want to just
[27:01] present the right atmosphere Lord we
[27:03] don't want to present an atmosphere of
[27:05] rebellion or resistance Lord but father
[27:09] we know Lord the hour we live in is an
[27:12] hour father that is coming to more
[27:16] perilous times for your word says that
[27:18] in the time that they would try peace
[27:21] peace then would come sudden destruction
[27:24] but Lord we are here today father our
[27:27] hearts still breaking Lord for the
[27:29] thousands of people that are affected by
[27:32] this virus literally tens of thousands
[27:35] Lord and we thank you for your hand of
[27:38] mercy that's been upon the believers
[27:41] Lord father we ask you to remain father
[27:44] as our protection father and Lord touch
[27:48] those families Lord whether they know
[27:50] you are not touched those families Lord
[27:53] father give consolation to their
[27:56] Souls father for those who have lost
[27:58] loved ones Lord or very sick now we
[28:01] asked Lord once again as I have said we
[28:04] are hand of mercy to be upon this group
[28:06] of believers to continue to lead us and
[28:09] guide us we ask this in the precious
[28:12] name of Jesus Christ amen
[28:15] you may be seated so tonight as it is
[28:19] that we are looking I have been
[28:22] listening to the sermon God's chosen
[28:25] place of worship so there'll be several
[28:27] references to that tonight because these
[28:31] things as have been working I've been
[28:34] able to just listen and it's been very
[28:37] good now in God's chosen place of
[28:40] worship I want to just start off with
[28:43] something that I believe would be each
[28:45] and every one of us desire it would be
[28:48] our prayer it would be something that
[28:51] unction we could speak out my brother
[28:54] and sister we never want to come to the
[28:56] place that we feel like we've got enough
[28:58] of God that we've got enough of the word
[29:00] that we've been in his presence enough
[29:03] we want to always be expressing Lord I
[29:07] would desire more now brother Branham
[29:10] says here and now with our heads bowed
[29:11] and I trust our hearts are bowed too I
[29:14] wonder how many in here tonight would
[29:17] like to be remembered in prayer and
[29:18] certainly Saints were not here together
[29:21] but you know what you're not lifting
[29:23] your hand to man anyhow you're not
[29:25] lifting your heart to man so just let
[29:28] the Lord know tonight you want to be
[29:30] remembered remembered in prayer of
[29:33] something special would you just raise
[29:36] your hand and say God give to me tonight
[29:40] that what I'm seeking for hallelujah I
[29:44] believe every one of us would just lift
[29:46] a hand and make that claim it might be
[29:49] something in the physical body that we
[29:52] would be needing the Lord to touch us it
[29:54] might be something that is as as the
[29:58] song says you know sins of the past sins
[30:01] a they're Satan's constantly coming in
[30:05] the greatest battle ever fought and
[30:07] sometimes we just simply need a
[30:09] deliverance from things of the past
[30:11] things that are or you might say a
[30:15] humiliating or shameful in our memory
[30:18] and we just ask the Lord tonight to give
[30:23] to us that that we're seeking for but I
[30:25] believe my brother and sister the real
[30:27] hearts desire in spite of what Satan
[30:29] might be trying to take you back to a
[30:32] certain time or place or event a
[30:35] circumstance my brother and sister I
[30:37] believe the thing that we as the Bride
[30:39] of Christ are really seeking for is more
[30:42] of the Lord amen
[30:43] do to find that place where we come into
[30:47] the unity of the Spirit come into
[30:49] rapturing faith in and we can discuss
[30:52] step right out of here that's what we're
[30:55] looking for and you know many people
[30:57] want to know you know is the bride going
[31:00] to be persecuted just listening to
[31:01] brother Jason DeMars give one of his
[31:04] little you might I don't know what they
[31:06] call him little webinar thing and you
[31:08] know and and he starts right off but
[31:11] very clearly what the prophet of God
[31:13] says that you know when that time comes
[31:16] that pressure that is coming on that the
[31:18] bride is not going to be closed up
[31:21] she'll be raised up amen she'll be
[31:24] lifted up amen
[31:26] so we're looking at and that's what
[31:28] we're looking for is that rapturing
[31:30] faith we're looking for that complete
[31:32] abandonment of our ability of our self
[31:36] or our security in our self and my
[31:39] brother and sister always when I think
[31:41] about security and selves I think of the
[31:44] rich young ruler and how the day come
[31:46] when he was lifted up his barns was full
[31:49] you might say his bank accounts were
[31:51] full but that was the very time the very
[31:54] season that his soul was accounted of
[31:57] him and and of course the next that he
[32:00] appears in Scripture he's looking across
[32:02] that broad Gulf and just desiring for
[32:05] just a finger to be touched in the water
[32:07] and brought to him so all of that that
[32:10] he accomplished in the in the natural
[32:13] left nothing tonight for him to to stand
[32:17] in security and so I say tonight I know
[32:20] what I'm seeking for I want more of the
[32:22] law
[32:22] I want this man purged I want this man
[32:25] washed by the water of the word and as
[32:27] the word comes forth my brother and
[32:29] sister I don't want a word that tickles
[32:31] us I don't want us to sit here as I
[32:34] spoke the other day as time goes forward
[32:36] I'm don't want to become you know a
[32:38] cranky old pastor I don't want to become
[32:41] you know just somebody that nobody wants
[32:43] to talk to but my brother and sister
[32:45] it's time for us to quit playing church
[32:48] and get serious a time for us to stop
[32:51] and sit at the edge of the pool and wait
[32:54] for the moving of God he said he would
[32:56] come he said he would be in our myths
[32:58] and he said that his power amen
[33:01] supernatural power would be in the midst
[33:03] of his people and we are his people can
[33:06] we say amen to that tonight we're not
[33:09] just hoping we're not just looking and
[33:11] wishing but we are acknowledging tonight
[33:14] you say well brother Paul you know we
[33:16] got to be careful yeah we got to be
[33:18] careful that the devil doesn't come in
[33:20] and rob our testimony or identity from
[33:24] us we got to be careful he doesn't
[33:26] silence our voices we got to be careful
[33:29] that he doesn't let tradition take us
[33:31] over we got to be careful that we don't
[33:33] just sit down and just say well if the
[33:36] Lord wants it to change he'll change it
[33:38] my brother and sister he's give us his
[33:40] word his word is open his word has been
[33:43] freely given to you and I too possess it
[33:46] and make it our very own and so if not
[33:49] we must take what has been given to us
[33:51] right our inheritance well I can tell
[33:55] you in the natural if someone come in
[33:58] and told you you had an inheritance and
[34:00] someone come the next day and said well
[34:02] because you have and I have not you must
[34:05] give this inheritance to me my brother
[34:08] and sister you would say I do not owe
[34:10] you devil anything and so we are sitting
[34:13] here today my brother and sister being
[34:16] careful about the wrong things we ought
[34:19] not be careful about jumping up out of
[34:21] our seat and shouting hallelujah we
[34:23] ought not be careful about saying thank
[34:25] the Lord and letting the world know what
[34:27] God has been doing for us we ought not
[34:30] be careful about singing we ought not be
[34:33] careful about crying and praising God
[34:36] the presents my brother and sister we
[34:38] ought not be careful about those things
[34:39] we ought to be careful about what the
[34:41] devil is trying to do amen
[34:44] so I tell you my brother and sister as
[34:46] you look at this and we move forward as
[34:48] sons and daughters of God I want to want
[34:50] to once again just give emphasis Oh God
[34:55] give me tonight that what I'm seeking
[34:59] for amen that's what we're here that's
[35:02] why we're gathered together that's why
[35:04] we have made a commitment my brother and
[35:06] sister to take as it is the hard road or
[35:09] the higher road amen now we look at this
[35:13] and and I just want to move in you know
[35:16] sometimes I remember some time back an
[35:19] individual had told me that they had
[35:23] partaken you might say of all of the
[35:26] message of the hour that they needed
[35:28] they just needed just a little bit here
[35:31] and there and my brother and sister I I
[35:33] don't know you don't have to agree with
[35:35] me I'm not trying to make some doctrinal
[35:37] point but I know that that is not me no
[35:39] matter how much I read my Bible no
[35:41] matter how much I pray no matter how
[35:43] much I have opportunity to listen to the
[35:45] Prophet
[35:46] I have never reached a point I say that
[35:49] was enough my brother and sister I want
[35:52] more there's more to be had amen the
[35:54] hungry soul Matthew the fifth chapter
[35:57] the sixth verse says Amen blessed are
[36:00] they who do hunger and thirst after
[36:03] righteousness for they shall be filled
[36:05] but just like in the human element we
[36:08] would eat today and we will be hungry in
[36:11] the morning in fact we might be hungry
[36:13] before we go to bed tonight and so you
[36:15] look at that my brother and sister how
[36:18] that sons and daughters of God they are
[36:20] taking in the word but we are also you
[36:23] might say consuming it and that is the
[36:26] very life that is within us that is the
[36:29] very wind as it were that would be
[36:31] beneath our wings you'll never see an
[36:33] eagle say I felt the currents enough I
[36:36] no longer need the current they're
[36:38] constantly seeking out the current to
[36:41] rise higher amen because you see even in
[36:45] the great ability of the Eagle the labor
[36:47] through to
[36:49] fly on its own to that elevation is more
[36:53] than the Eagle would possess within
[36:55] itself but God giving an instinct to the
[36:57] Eagle to seek out the thermal current
[37:00] and to ride that into heavenly places
[37:03] and we are sons and daughters of God
[37:05] today with a hunger in our soul a desire
[37:08] in our soul my brother and sister that
[37:11] we want this soul to be satisfied now
[37:14] the prophet of God talks about how in
[37:16] what a shame he says it is that people
[37:19] would take that that spiritual hunger
[37:21] that God placed into a man or a woman's
[37:24] life and do satisfy or try to satisfy
[37:28] that with the things of the world amen
[37:31] now I'm not going to speak ill of
[37:33] watching a movie at home and these kind
[37:35] of things but I just want us to be aware
[37:38] that sometimes we need to just go to the
[37:40] word when we start to look at these
[37:42] things and we say well and I need
[37:45] something to preoccupy me I need
[37:46] something to do this if we're not
[37:48] careful God might be speaking to you to
[37:51] go pick up your Bible to pick up the
[37:53] message and we'll go satisfy it with
[37:56] watching a doctrine documentary on the
[37:58] Titanic or up on this orb on that and
[38:01] I'm not speaking down to you my brother
[38:03] and sister I've done this same thing but
[38:05] we got to be careful just like
[38:07] oftentimes they tell you that people
[38:09] will go start rummaging through the
[38:11] fridge they'll think they're hungry but
[38:14] reality is they're actually thirsty and
[38:17] they're looking for something in the
[38:19] body sending the signal but they're
[38:22] misinterpreting the signal and believing
[38:25] they're hungry when the body's actually
[38:26] crying out because it's thirsty and
[38:29] sometimes my brother and sister I
[38:30] believe we we don't respond in the right
[38:33] way but I say I stand with this tonight
[38:36] blessed are they who hunger and thirst
[38:38] after righteousness keep pursuing it
[38:41] don't stop never let someone convince
[38:43] you that you've got enough of this
[38:45] message this word of the hour keep
[38:48] digging keep consuming my brother and
[38:50] sister until we become the very word
[38:54] hallelujah we don't have to satisfy or
[38:57] settle for just being message believers
[39:00] believing that something was sent
[39:02] believing
[39:03] something's been presented we buy the
[39:05] word the prophet of God I won't go into
[39:07] the quote tonight but the prophet of God
[39:10] said that we have to become the very
[39:14] word Oh hallelujah my you are what you
[39:21] eat I hope tonight you're not a disney
[39:24] princess you see this hunger and thirst
[39:33] will be with us the prophet of god says
[39:36] and i'm not going to go into the quotes
[39:38] you know if you know the message you'll
[39:39] know I'm telling you the truth he said
[39:42] wherever there's a hunger there has to
[39:45] be something to satisfy that hunger he
[39:49] ties that in in the deep calleth to the
[39:51] deep and if there's a deep calling there
[39:53] must be a deep to respond so we as
[39:58] humans all built in the same elements
[40:00] you might say now not talking about the
[40:02] perversion that Satan would bring upon
[40:04] humanity just talking about the very
[40:07] nature of humanity where there is a deep
[40:10] calling there must be a deep to respond
[40:13] and if you're crying out for more of God
[40:15] that means there is more of God to be
[40:18] given to you what you've got to do is
[40:21] lift up your hand as we were there in
[40:23] that prayer lord give me tonight when
[40:25] I'm seeking for give me today Lord what
[40:28] I need because it's there it's available
[40:31] well will we possess that will we take
[40:35] and claim that amen
[40:38] hallelujah now look my brothers and
[40:41] sisters as we'll look at this
[40:42] tonight we'll recognize what we're
[40:45] looking at here is a self analysis of
[40:49] our spiritual condition now my brother
[40:54] and sister I always found it ironic how
[40:57] that it's so easy for us to judge others
[41:01] and say you know what I think they
[41:04] should do this or this do you really
[41:09] realize you're taking a very moral
[41:11] position you're believing you hold high
[41:13] ground and are qualified to judge the
[41:16] individual in their situation you know
[41:19] the irony of this comes out in a little
[41:22] cartoon that I I saw and here is a very
[41:25] obese doctor talking to a very obese man
[41:29] and he's telling him you must cut out
[41:34] all of these foods that are contributing
[41:37] to your obesity my brother and sister
[41:42] how can one judge Amen what we've got to
[41:47] do is stop and say you know what Lord
[41:49] I'm not here to judge others tonight my
[41:52] real concern Lord is to look at my own
[41:55] soul to stand in front of the mirror of
[41:58] the word and look at my own soul because
[42:01] you see God is going to correct us can
[42:04] we say amen to that he's going to put us
[42:07] in a position where we will see and and
[42:10] we shouldn't be glum we shouldn't be
[42:12] despondent we shouldn't be depressed
[42:15] about that we should be saying Lord put
[42:18] me in the position where I see my
[42:20] shortcoming put me in the position Lord
[42:23] where I recognize by the word Lord that
[42:26] I have something missing or I have
[42:29] focused too much on something and Lord
[42:32] let me see it let the preaching of the
[42:34] word let it come from the tape let it
[42:37] just come to me by as it were revelation
[42:40] let me come Lord to see where my
[42:42] shortcoming might be because my heart's
[42:45] desire Lord is not just to live a good
[42:47] life here and I'll tell you Saints I
[42:49] desire to live a good life here I want
[42:52] to live a good life here amen if the
[42:54] Lord tarries another 50 years I want to
[42:57] have a good life till my life is over
[42:59] but my brother and sister what's more
[43:01] important than a good life is a life in
[43:05] Jesus Christ amen a life that our soul
[43:08] having been washed by the water of the
[43:10] word has a Liberty do you know we can
[43:13] have all the freedoms in the world in
[43:15] the United States has as much or more
[43:16] freedoms than any country on the face of
[43:19] the earth my brother and sister and yet
[43:21] we're a nation that is in the greatest
[43:23] bondage of indignation in the earth my
[43:26] brother and sister so you see what we're
[43:28] looking for is not just the freedom
[43:30] to get in our car and drive downtown and
[43:33] buy an ice cream it is not just a
[43:35] Liberty to say we're going to town for a
[43:37] pizza tonight it's not those kind of
[43:39] liberties who are looking for we're
[43:41] looking for the Liberty that is in the
[43:43] soul that leaves us day by day knowing
[43:47] with the security I might have made a
[43:49] mistake today Lord forgive me but I have
[43:52] a security a Liberty in me to know that
[43:55] as a son or daughter of God that the
[43:58] Lord will correct me he will not always
[44:00] leave me out there in permissable will
[44:03] he will not always leave me out there in
[44:05] the shadows because I am his child he
[44:08] will bring me right back into the word
[44:10] again and you talk about something that
[44:12] gives you a security now some would say
[44:15] well brother Paul we've never really
[44:17] went out by God's grace we've lived you
[44:19] know a good life we've lived the word
[44:21] well but I say thank you Lord but some
[44:24] of us had to go out and Rumble through
[44:26] the brambles and over the rocks and fall
[44:29] off a cliff or to my brother and sister
[44:31] and I have to be honest with you I think
[44:33] that gives some of us a maybe tad bit
[44:36] greater appreciation for what God is
[44:38] doing to know that we once were lost and
[44:40] when I say lost not in the metaphorical
[44:43] sense but literally lost and had no clue
[44:46] where we were going and God come along
[44:48] and said because you are my son because
[44:50] you are my daughter I will bring you
[44:53] back and put you in the right place amen
[44:56] because you see there's still a hunger
[44:59] and there's still a thirst that's hiding
[45:02] down in the heart of every backslidden
[45:05] Christian oh my brother and sister God
[45:08] won't let that go he's going to keep
[45:10] that there and he'll tickle it he'll
[45:13] tickle that he'll he'll bring it about
[45:15] to where your consciousness brings you
[45:18] back to the place and you will
[45:19] acknowledge I know I should be doing
[45:21] different and you see what God's doing
[45:23] is giving us a self-examination of our
[45:26] own soul that we can look at it and say
[45:29] lord help me I'm seeking something
[45:32] greater than I have right now amen
[45:36] hallelujah well thank you lord you know
[45:39] my brother and sister look here what the
[45:42] brush brother brown I'm saying here I'm
[45:44] the sev
[45:44] church age book see now what we don't
[45:47] want to do Saints is get to a position
[45:50] we fool ourselves that we would come
[45:54] along we recognize that Laodicea is the
[45:56] culmination of all the ages it's a
[46:00] culmination of God's plan he's bringing
[46:03] it into fruition but if we're not
[46:07] careful my brother and sister will get
[46:09] the idea that we are something more than
[46:13] anybody else has ever been or will be
[46:15] now understand we can take the scripture
[46:18] that they without us will not be made
[46:21] perfect but you see that's because we're
[46:23] a last part or a Lynch key or the
[46:25] Keystone or however you want to put it
[46:28] in the equation so for the plan to be
[46:30] perfect we've got to show up amen but
[46:33] look what the brother Brown says here in
[46:35] the church age book Laodicean Church age
[46:37] now they're all saying or trying to
[46:39] prove that they have it all talking
[46:41] about the denominations or they have
[46:43] enough yet is that the truth compare
[46:46] this 20th century Church to the first
[46:49] century Church go ahead do that so we
[46:54] can start having a comparison I like to
[46:57] do that do you guys like to do that I'll
[46:59] tell you I'm a real pro and con guy
[47:01] sometimes you just got to stop and just
[47:04] talk it through and say okay if I do
[47:06] this what's the benefits of this and if
[47:09] I do this what is the negative or the
[47:11] con part of it and and when you start to
[47:14] look at that my when you come to
[47:16] something that has way more negatives
[47:18] than it has positives you know it's
[47:19] caused you to stop and look and say this
[47:22] isn't really such a good idea
[47:24] amen so I'm real into that amen I
[47:27] scratch paper all the time about you
[47:30] know should I or shouldn't I kind of and
[47:32] and that's not my answer my brother and
[47:34] sister I tried to mostly oh I'm just
[47:38] like you I don't always pray about it
[47:43] sometimes we just do it and hope for the
[47:46] best
[47:47] lord help us he's right there to give us
[47:50] advice amen the greatest financial
[47:53] planning book in the world is right here
[47:55] amen I believe in people like Dave
[47:58] Xion and their what they're promoting my
[48:01] brother and sister but you know what if
[48:02] you need marriage counseling here's the
[48:04] book hey man you don't need something
[48:06] written by a psychologist that's been
[48:08] married three times
[48:09] amen you want to raise your kids you
[48:12] don't need to go out here and find some
[48:14] book that some guys written you don't
[48:15] even know if he's got the Holy Ghost
[48:17] when right here is the book on how to
[48:19] raise your children amen you will you
[48:21] have problems in your friendships right
[48:24] here's the book that has the answer to
[48:26] friendship
[48:27] amen you have a problem with anything
[48:29] right here is the key but the problem is
[48:31] we read it we read it like it was a
[48:33] self-help book and if we can't find the
[48:36] answer on page one we look on to we look
[48:38] on three we take the quiz on four we
[48:40] didn't get an answer still we go to five
[48:42] my brother and sister you got to read it
[48:44] saying Lord reveal this to me or it's
[48:48] still hid and I've read a few of them
[48:50] self-help books and some of them are
[48:52] just about that bad you got to buy
[48:53] addition two three four and five to get
[48:56] the answer and in the end they basically
[48:58] tell you well we just live in a bad time
[49:00] and your kids are gonna go nuts anyhow
[49:02] oh my brother insist nonsense we can
[49:06] raise children filled with the Holy
[49:08] Ghost they love the Lord amen because we
[49:11] got the book hallelujah
[49:13] compare this 20th century Church to the
[49:16] first century Church go ahead do that
[49:17] where is the power where is the love now
[49:21] my brother and sister what brother Brown
[49:24] was saying right here has lost many
[49:26] people to walk away from the message
[49:28] because they say well there's no love in
[49:30] the message but they themselves are
[49:32] absent of love you see once again
[49:35] they're taking a moral high ground to
[49:37] say well I see no love in you but yet
[49:41] they're not displaying love themselves
[49:43] see we got to be careful because as we
[49:46] examine our soul we have to realize my
[49:48] brother and sister for everything that
[49:50] we were judged we will be judged for
[49:52] amen so where is the power some people
[49:55] that say there's no power in the church
[49:57] but I tell you my brother and sister
[49:58] coming across through either messages or
[50:01] whatever there's testimonies coming from
[50:03] North America South America Africa
[50:06] Europe the Philippines Australia there
[50:09] is just miracle after miracle taking
[50:11] place
[50:12] and because we don't publish it on the
[50:14] headlines we don't have our own version
[50:16] of the PTL Club that we're publishing on
[50:19] television my brother and sister just
[50:21] because it's not coming out in that
[50:23] fashion but before you doesn't mean it's
[50:25] not happening so where is the power
[50:27] where is the love or this this is what
[50:30] really strikes me where is the purified
[50:33] church that withstood sin and walked
[50:36] with faith toward Jesus where is the
[50:39] unity you can't find it now my brother
[50:44] and sister sometimes we have faults
[50:45] senses of unity we can have special
[50:48] meetings that would be very broad and
[50:50] you'll have great groups of people I've
[50:53] experienced this in South America you
[50:55] can have great groups of people and
[50:57] you'll have all kinds of different
[50:59] ideologies ministries with different
[51:02] ideologies and they all come together
[51:04] and they sing and they shout and they
[51:07] yell amen and the meetings seem to go so
[51:10] beautifully but I tell you where the
[51:12] evidence is is what starts cropping up
[51:15] after the meetings are over and that's
[51:17] when certain people would come and say
[51:19] well you know brother so-and-so preached
[51:22] a good sermon but I disagree with this
[51:25] this and this and this one here said
[51:27] this and I don't agree with that my
[51:29] brother and sister you see we can have
[51:32] what we in the flesh think is a unity
[51:34] but we're looking for a unity in the
[51:37] body of Christ that starts at the soul
[51:40] level it doesn't start out here in the
[51:42] flesh level where we all agree that
[51:44] vanilla ice cream is what we want and we
[51:47] all want barbecued hamburgers and no
[51:49] onions and this and this and this that's
[51:52] not the unity we're talking about this
[51:54] is when a whole group of people can come
[51:57] and be connected to the Holy Ghost amen
[52:00] filled with the Holy Ghost inspired by
[52:03] the Holy Ghost led by the Holy Ghost and
[52:05] they have one thought in mind and they
[52:07] will come and yield themselves they're
[52:10] not causing that to all yield to them
[52:13] they are yielding to the leadership of
[52:16] the Holy Ghost and there is true unity
[52:18] because when you have sons and daughters
[52:21] of God my brother and sister God will
[52:23] bring them into unit
[52:25] hey men it won't be a man-made work we
[52:28] don't have to have a group we don't have
[52:29] to have some special thing happen to get
[52:32] people to come together my brother and
[52:34] sister that's unity of the flesh we're
[52:36] looking towards unity of the Spirit amen
[52:38] you can't find it if this church has all
[52:41] it needs
[52:42] why were they crying are these last
[52:44] lines here just strike me if this church
[52:48] meaning the First Church age has all its
[52:54] needs
[52:55] why were they crying out for more of God
[52:58] in the book of Acts and so they didn't
[53:02] have it all and yet they had far more
[53:05] than they have today see what we're
[53:14] looking to my brother and sister is to
[53:18] do the checkup the diagnostic now I
[53:23] might be getting ahead of myself I don't
[53:25] honestly at this moment remember what
[53:27] quotes I put in and what ones I chose to
[53:29] go ahead and leave out but my brother
[53:32] and sister you see we're coming to a
[53:34] time or coming to a place that were so
[53:38] close to the end of the world we're
[53:40] coming down the time is wrapping itself
[53:43] up anyone with any spiritual
[53:45] discernment' around the world it doesn't
[53:47] matter what you're talking the Catholics
[53:49] are all of the Lutheran's and
[53:51] Episcopalians whatever they're all
[53:53] acknowledging that they're seeing these
[53:55] signs coming but my brother and sister
[53:57] it's only a true examination of our soul
[54:00] we can look out here if we're students
[54:03] of the scripture we can look out here
[54:05] and say I see these signs of the time
[54:07] and I see this sign over here I see a
[54:10] sign over here but the sign we really
[54:13] want to look at is the sign of the
[54:15] condition of our soul amen that we are
[54:18] looking here not becoming we can be
[54:21] living good lives my brother and sister
[54:22] we can be living a life committed to
[54:25] serving God but if the fire is not there
[54:29] amen if the oil is not in the vessel it
[54:32] will matter what kind of life that we've
[54:35] lived right remember the foolish virgin
[54:37] amen brother branham's
[54:38] says you could not touch their life but
[54:42] when the moment came they recognized you
[54:45] see they didn't have to face the
[54:47] bridegroom I know you heard this many
[54:50] times but I just want you to once again
[54:52] ponder this the foolish virgin did not
[54:57] have to face the bridegroom and be told
[55:01] that she was short of oil at the moment
[55:08] of the cry behold the bridegroom cometh
[55:11] she knew now if she will know at that
[55:18] moment and we can set here his sons and
[55:20] daughters of God knowing that God wants
[55:23] us to examine our own life as we take
[55:25] communion amen let a man examine himself
[55:29] let's not wait until the cry behold the
[55:32] bridegroom cometh my brother and sister
[55:35] let's just check make sure is my soul
[55:38] ready amen
[55:39] is this the moment you know and actually
[55:41] I tell you what this might sound a
[55:43] little different to you I actually enjoy
[55:46] it you're probably all thinking what's
[55:52] his problem well I actually enjoy it
[55:55] because you see I'm not afraid to say
[55:57] I'm sorry I'm not afraid to repent and
[56:00] to weep before my lord
[56:02] Amen I actually enjoy this you know how
[56:06] some people have a bucket list they call
[56:08] it you know I want to go here I want to
[56:12] go there I want to travel to this
[56:14] country go to this place and slow but
[56:16] sure if they're fortunate they get to
[56:18] start checking things off their bucket
[56:19] list hallelujah well I believe the bride
[56:22] has a bucket list and that is today I
[56:26] was washed by the water of the word get
[56:30] up in the morning be able to say today I
[56:33] was washed by the water of the word and
[56:36] she just keeps to keep checking that off
[56:38] but the only way she knows my brother
[56:40] and sister is if she's looking to see
[56:42] that she's in that position amen so you
[56:46] look at that and I just hope that you
[56:48] would look at that quote again to
[56:50] realize we sometimes
[56:52] well okay you know we've got the message
[56:54] of restoration but we we're not my
[56:58] brother and sisters scot-free here we've
[57:00] got to keep stepping up to the mark
[57:03] we've got to keep pressing forward amen
[57:07] now in the sermon God's chosen place of
[57:10] worship brother Branham then says
[57:13] paragraph four he says and then father
[57:15] we pray that you'll visit us tonight in
[57:18] the word we come here for correction
[57:24] oftentimes we all this might sound just
[57:29] a very broad brushstroke but often times
[57:33] around the message people are really
[57:34] wanting to hear deep things things that
[57:37] stir them things that they they you know
[57:40] can really analyze and you know things
[57:43] that can say wow I never saw that before
[57:45] but here it is you know 1965 February
[57:50] 20th brother Browns preaching on God's
[57:53] chosen place of worship and he says we
[57:59] came here for correction he doesn't
[58:02] leave correction last maybe that was
[58:05] just a fluke we came here for correction
[58:09] for understanding there's revelation
[58:12] that we might know just how to live in
[58:15] this present day what to look forward to
[58:19] what to do see he's covering the whole
[58:22] spectrum he's not just saying we're here
[58:26] to dig into the deep mysteries that you
[58:29] will be able to to you know share
[58:31] something that no one else has seen no
[58:33] my brother and sister we're here for
[58:35] correction we're here for revelation
[58:37] we're here to know how to live in this
[58:40] present day and what to look forward to
[58:43] so our eyes are being open to what is in
[58:46] front of us amen and what to do
[58:49] amen so we're not a people that say hey
[58:51] God's gonna lift this up he's gonna do
[58:53] all this stuff but we don't know how to
[58:54] do it for we know the coming of the Lord
[58:57] is drawing nigh according to all the
[58:59] signs that the prophets foretold we're
[59:01] nearing the time Lord when complete
[59:04] deliverance will be
[59:05] giving to your children now that's
[59:08] something to look forward to my brother
[59:09] and sister complete deliverance amen not
[59:14] one evil spirit to hinder us amen not
[59:17] one thing in the flesh to hinder us that
[59:20] clean complete deliverance will be just
[59:22] one step right into the rapture amen
[59:25] God led us everyone be there father may
[59:28] there not be not be one missing that's
[59:31] our purpose of being here Lord we love
[59:35] you and we're trying to prepare for that
[59:39] hour see that's what we're here that's
[59:42] why we're in church my brother and
[59:43] sister that's why when you see people
[59:45] and I'm not criticizing anyone I don't
[59:48] agree but when you find people that
[59:51] think they can just go to as it were the
[59:53] backside of the mountain the backside of
[59:55] the desert and just listen to tapes and
[59:57] they're going to be just fine my brother
[59:59] and sister it's interesting I've talked
[1:00:01] to a few of these people that God's
[1:00:03] opened their eyes and and they changed
[1:00:05] their direction and one brother admitted
[1:00:07] to me one time he said the thing that
[1:00:09] caught my attention is he said I had
[1:00:12] narrowed the list of the tapes I wanted
[1:00:15] to listen to down to the ones that made
[1:00:18] me feel good the ones where the prophet
[1:00:22] of God spoke very direct spoke to the
[1:00:25] things that were in my life he said I
[1:00:27] found myself slow but sure not listening
[1:00:30] to them now look you do whatever you
[1:00:32] want to folks but I tell you if you're
[1:00:34] attending a church that's got a Holy
[1:00:37] Ghost filled pastor who loves you and
[1:00:39] cares for you and God speaks to him amen
[1:00:42] he's not gonna be on pre-record and
[1:00:44] you're not gonna tell him I want you to
[1:00:46] preach on this this Sunday because I
[1:00:47] want to feel good this Sunday he's gonna
[1:00:49] preach on what God lays in his heart and
[1:00:52] then you'll have to deal with it but you
[1:00:54] see if you don't want to deal with it
[1:00:56] well and save the pieces amen what
[1:00:58] you'll do is you'll just go home and
[1:01:00] start listening to the tapes that make
[1:01:02] you feel good and pretty soon you'll be
[1:01:04] a feel-good Christian that's not looking
[1:01:06] at the condition of the soul because the
[1:01:09] condition of the soul my brother and
[1:01:10] sister needs a washing of the water of
[1:01:13] the word and not according to you amen
[1:01:16] so God wants you to
[1:01:18] through the word Amen not from your
[1:01:21] rose-colored glasses but from the
[1:01:23] preaching of the word let it come forth
[1:01:26] with authority that then you sit on the
[1:01:29] Pew or however it might be and you were
[1:01:31] set there and say ouch that hurt but
[1:01:33] instead of saying I won't listen to that
[1:01:35] preacher what you're gonna do is then
[1:01:37] say Lord let me go back to the word let
[1:01:40] me find myself in the word and Lord
[1:01:42] correct me because I want to be right in
[1:01:45] your sight Lord no one else's sight
[1:01:47] not even my own sight I want to be right
[1:01:49] in your sight Lord so if I have to say
[1:01:52] ouch help me Lord forgive me Lord I'm
[1:01:55] gonna do it but I'll tell you my brother
[1:01:57] and sister is actually a lapse of
[1:01:59] character when people as Christians
[1:02:02] cliff claiming they have the Holy Ghost
[1:02:04] claim they filled revelation of the word
[1:02:07] for this hour and they take the easy way
[1:02:09] out my brother and sister that is a
[1:02:11] lapse on their part amen
[1:02:13] God didn't call us to take the easy way
[1:02:15] out he called us to take the correct way
[1:02:17] out amen
[1:02:18] now somebody might not like that and I'm
[1:02:21] sorry that you don't like that but it is
[1:02:23] the truth amen God wants you to
[1:02:25] sometimes just say okay I don't like
[1:02:27] what the preacher preaches I don't like
[1:02:29] how he's doing that but if God led you
[1:02:31] to that church maybe you ought to just
[1:02:33] kind of listen to the Lord after a while
[1:02:35] and say well if God led me here there
[1:02:37] must have been a purpose or we'll take
[1:02:39] the easy way out we'll find a new church
[1:02:41] that doesn't preach the things that rub
[1:02:43] us wrong amen because sometimes the
[1:02:45] things that rub you wrong you say well I
[1:02:47] don't like what they're preaching Amen
[1:02:49] well that's good my brother and sister
[1:02:50] if you don't like what they're preaching
[1:02:52] go back to the word and if it lines up
[1:02:54] with the words say Amen to it if it
[1:02:56] don't line up the word you're obligated
[1:02:58] to come and say look this isn't the
[1:03:00] message where do you preach it amen so
[1:03:02] just because it rubs you wrong doesn't
[1:03:04] mean that's a reason to reject it maybe
[1:03:06] you need to embrace it
[1:03:07] amen sometimes my brother and sister
[1:03:10] will see that God comes down in very
[1:03:12] peculiar ways amen and he also comes in
[1:03:15] very particular ways to cause us amen to
[1:03:18] shift course amen I'll tell you what
[1:03:20] it's there you know just like the little
[1:03:23] story now pardon me for using the humor
[1:03:25] like this but one time there was a
[1:03:27] captain of a very large ship and he gets
[1:03:30] on the radio and he says hey
[1:03:32] you know ship or light in front of me
[1:03:34] give way to the starboard or whatever
[1:03:38] you know right or left and then he goes
[1:03:42] a little further and it hasn't changed
[1:03:43] and he gets on the radio again and he
[1:03:46] says hey you know light in front of me
[1:03:49] you know move to the right or left and
[1:03:51] finally a voice comes in response to his
[1:03:54] deal and he says sir I recommend that
[1:03:57] you move to the right or to the left and
[1:03:59] the captain says I'm the captain of the
[1:04:01] such-and-such ship and the man comes
[1:04:04] back on the radio and says and I'm the
[1:04:05] up keeper of the lighthouse amen
[1:04:09] my brother and sisters sometimes God
[1:04:10] wants to let us amen be forced to move
[1:04:14] out of our position in spite of what we
[1:04:18] think or what we want or how we see it
[1:04:21] God is going to move us my brother and
[1:04:23] sister I'm assuming the captain of that
[1:04:25] large ship decided he was going to move
[1:04:27] to the right or to the left
[1:04:29] amen so if God's trying to do that amen
[1:04:32] going back into this last quote that
[1:04:34] that's the purpose of our being here
[1:04:36] Lord we love you and we're trying to
[1:04:39] prepare for that hour amen the second
[1:04:43] afflicted that's in the building we pray
[1:04:45] that you will heal them Lord especially
[1:04:46] them with spiritual needs and I would
[1:04:50] say at any time my brother and sister
[1:04:52] that if we have the option we have the
[1:04:56] ability to have God do something in our
[1:04:58] life I just encourage you to take the
[1:05:01] spiritual need over the physical need
[1:05:03] amen always choose that and that is
[1:05:06] uplifting to the soul I would rather go
[1:05:09] to meet the Lord with physical
[1:05:11] affliction and not spiritual afflictions
[1:05:14] amen hallelujah we pray that you'll save
[1:05:16] every lost soul fill every believer with
[1:05:19] the Holy Ghost and renew this strength
[1:05:22] and the power in your believing children
[1:05:24] amen
[1:05:26] Oh grant these things father I like this
[1:05:29] last line here grant these things father
[1:05:31] we ask much you told us to ask ask
[1:05:35] abundance ask for great things many of
[1:05:39] them oh my brother and sister I don't
[1:05:42] know I'm just saying this to encourage
[1:05:44] to stir your minds in
[1:05:46] but when was the last time you asked the
[1:05:48] Lord just to pour his spirit out on you
[1:05:51] to the point that you didn't even know
[1:05:53] who you were what you were doing when
[1:05:54] was the last time we asked the Lord to
[1:05:57] just pour the abundance of his word upon
[1:05:59] our life that we would just say I feel a
[1:06:01] Liberty but you know what happens my
[1:06:03] brother and sister if we're not careful
[1:06:04] I've done it myself many times we
[1:06:07] getting into the rut amen brother Chris
[1:06:10] here again that service touched me
[1:06:12] profoundly instead of coming and
[1:06:14] thanking the Lord for the things we
[1:06:15] haven't even seen manifested yet we come
[1:06:18] with a list Lord you need to this and
[1:06:21] Lord you need to that and Lord you need
[1:06:23] to my brother and sister how many times
[1:06:25] as a child I remember my dad used to
[1:06:27] haul the milk to town in the metal cans
[1:06:30] and and you know my dad had had his
[1:06:34] peculiar way of raising a child and and
[1:06:36] so you know we would we would want to go
[1:06:39] with dad to come to the creamery because
[1:06:42] you had to deliver your own cans at that
[1:06:44] time and as a little kid we would back
[1:06:47] up to the deal there and and then you
[1:06:49] had to tell the man that you were there
[1:06:51] and you filled out this little card and
[1:06:53] you hung it on a clip and that clip was
[1:06:56] on a chain and it went inside and then
[1:06:58] you started putting your cans on on the
[1:07:01] chain and they went inside the creamery
[1:07:03] and they used just set there for a few
[1:07:06] minutes and then your cans came out
[1:07:08] empty and washed and you put them back
[1:07:11] on your truck and for our help our dad
[1:07:14] would stop on the way home and a little
[1:07:17] ice cream a hamburger place there in the
[1:07:20] edge of Caldwell and he would buy an ice
[1:07:22] cream cone that was our pay for helping
[1:07:25] and as a small child my brother and
[1:07:27] sister that was better than money
[1:07:29] amen and the man the man and woman who
[1:07:32] owned that little ice cream shop amen
[1:07:34] you know they would see us coming we
[1:07:36] were regulars I guess you would say and
[1:07:39] they would always look at my dad and and
[1:07:42] say however many of us kids was with him
[1:07:45] you know 1 2 3 small ice cream cones and
[1:07:50] my dad would say yep that's what we can
[1:07:53] afford and those small ice cream cones
[1:07:56] came out of that little hand out window
[1:07:58] Oh
[1:08:00] brother and sister there was nothing
[1:08:01] small about them but you see there was
[1:08:04] something going on there an
[1:08:05] encouragement and we look at the life
[1:08:08] that we are living here in the things
[1:08:10] that is happening in the world around us
[1:08:11] my brother and sister we are not sons
[1:08:14] and daughters of God to sit here and
[1:08:16] wait for a handout we are here to look
[1:08:19] at our own soul and ask and ask an
[1:08:22] abundance Lord deal with this issue in
[1:08:25] my life now my brother and sister one of
[1:08:28] the first things they say about
[1:08:29] realizing you you have to speak
[1:08:32] addictions or issues is for you to be
[1:08:35] able to confess that and what we should
[1:08:37] be saying my brother so you say we're
[1:08:39] brother Paul why are you saying this
[1:08:41] we're we're good godly people that's
[1:08:43] right my brother and sister and we want
[1:08:45] to stay that way so what we're gonna do
[1:08:47] is just make sure that Satan has no open
[1:08:50] door that Satan has no voice that Satan
[1:08:53] has no rights to come in no rights to
[1:08:55] dictate no rights to gloat or to boast
[1:08:58] and so what we're gonna do is every
[1:09:01] single day we're gonna say Lord is there
[1:09:03] something in my life Lord if there is
[1:09:06] reveal it to me and I will go before you
[1:09:10] and I will correct that now my brother
[1:09:12] and sisters some people think that's not
[1:09:13] necessary
[1:09:14] if you think I'm overkill on that that's
[1:09:16] fine but I'll tell you I have Amen some
[1:09:19] support in this scripture for that
[1:09:21] thought and so we'll just move along and
[1:09:24] see if we can't get there amen
[1:09:26] also in God's chosen place of worship
[1:09:28] brother Branham says here you know you
[1:09:30] used to have an old colored friend he
[1:09:33] said to me he said brother Billy he said
[1:09:39] I don't want any trouble at the river he
[1:09:43] said I want to have my ticket in my hand
[1:09:45] and when the whistle blows I don't want
[1:09:48] any trouble there I asked the Lord a
[1:09:51] long time ago if there's anything wrong
[1:09:55] let me set it up right now can we relate
[1:10:00] to this old color brother Lord let me
[1:10:02] settle it up right now don't let it go
[1:10:05] till tomorrow no let it linger till next

[1:10:52] hallelujah I hope you're catching my
[1:10:54] point tonight Amen just an encouragement
[1:10:56] Saints that we would just stop sometime
[1:10:59] in each and every day and just say Lord
[1:11:01] forgive me if I have stepped over the
[1:11:03] line and whatever is happened Lord just
[1:11:06] forgive me and Lord show me so I want to
[1:11:08] make it right I want to settle this up
[1:11:11] so whatever time hey men I tell you my
[1:11:14] brother and sister is starting to scare
[1:11:15] me because kids I went to school with
[1:11:17] wait they're not kids they're old people
[1:11:18] now you know like they said about this
[1:11:23] virus you know when they're saying well
[1:11:24] we got to be careful protect the old
[1:11:28] people and then you wait wake up I am
[1:11:33] the old people my brother and sister you
[1:11:36] see what we want to do is just make sure
[1:11:40] as I said people I went to school with
[1:11:45] they're burying them right and left it's
[1:11:48] kind of scary amen
[1:11:51] calls us to realize there's no assurance
[1:11:53] we might not even have tomorrow to make
[1:11:56] it right
[1:11:57] but we've got today and we've got right
[1:12:01] now
[1:12:02] and I could take you to another sermon I
[1:12:05] was listening to today also and brother
[1:12:07] Branham says those of you come into the
[1:12:09] altar we thank the Lord we praise the
[1:12:13] Lord for all of you come into the altar
[1:12:15] and we'll stay here
[1:12:17] just as long as it takes for everyone
[1:12:21] that God moves upon to come
[1:12:24] oh my would we have that kind of
[1:12:30] patients in church anymore to give the
[1:12:33] people the opportunity to get their
[1:12:37] lives right well hallelujah amen
[1:12:42] my brother and sister I think we need to
[1:12:47] start taking church just a tad bit more
[1:12:49] serious but wait that's just an opinion
[1:12:54] Hebrews six and seventeen says we're in
[1:12:58] God willing more abundantly to show unto
[1:13:02] the heirs of the promise the
[1:13:05] immutability of his counsel confirmed it
[1:13:08] by an oath the heirs of the promise
[1:13:16] confirmed it that by two immutable
[1:13:19] things in which it was impossible for
[1:13:22] God to lie that we might have a strong
[1:13:24] consolation who have fled for refuge see
[1:13:28] there's the key word the activator my
[1:13:30] brother and sister if we haven't fled
[1:13:32] for refuge then we cannot claim this
[1:13:35] Amen we can't have a consolation we
[1:13:38] can't claim this position if we haven't
[1:13:40] bothered to run into the refuge amen
[1:13:43] but those who have fled for refuge lay
[1:13:45] hold on the upon the hope set before us
[1:13:47] which hope we have as an anchor of the
[1:13:49] soul both sure and steadfast which in
[1:13:53] Earth into that within the veil you see
[1:13:56] we're not anchored my brother and sister
[1:13:58] the real message believer would that be
[1:14:01] offensive to people I wonder the real
[1:14:04] message believer is not anchored on this
[1:14:08] side of the veil the real message
[1:14:11] believer is anchored on the other side
[1:14:14] of the veil amen
[1:14:16] anchored in that position in Jesus
[1:14:19] Christ amen
[1:14:20] anchored as the anchor of the soul both
[1:14:22] sure and steadfast and which in Earth
[1:14:25] into that within the veil amen on the
[1:14:29] other side of the veil whither the
[1:14:31] forerunner is for us interred amen who's
[1:14:35] the forerunner Jesus Christ he
[1:14:37] he has entered behind the veil amen and
[1:14:40] was made high priest forever after the
[1:14:42] order of melchizedek Oh hallelujah my
[1:14:46] brother and sister we said here tonight
[1:14:48] and my encouragement is just stop every
[1:14:53] day I'm not trying to say that
[1:14:57] something's wrong I'm just encouraging
[1:15:00] you to each day stop and make sure
[1:15:05] everything is right we want to be able
[1:15:08] to stand and someone say is it well with
[1:15:11] your soul we don't want to stop and say
[1:15:13] well I need I need now what we want to
[1:15:17] do is someone says is it well with your
[1:15:20] soul to be able to say it as well with
[1:15:22] my soul it is well Shalom amen that's
[1:15:27] the position we want to live in Saints
[1:15:29] not day by day under some wall a shadow
[1:15:33] cloud of condemnation amen but to just
[1:15:36] put these things under the blood day by
[1:15:39] day just let the water invite the water
[1:15:42] of the word to wash us and and leave us
[1:15:45] to a place that at no matter what time
[1:15:47] or place amen right on the highway there
[1:15:50] farm way and you stick this morning
[1:15:52] someone lost their life in an auto
[1:15:53] accident I don't believe my brother and
[1:15:56] sister that they got up this morning
[1:15:57] with any idea that this would be their
[1:16:00] last day on earth
[1:16:01] hallelujah now we don't say that for the
[1:16:03] fear factor it's just we want to be
[1:16:05] ready hey man we want to be able to sit
[1:16:08] there and say you know what praise the
[1:16:09] Lord if today is my last day if I go to
[1:16:12] bed tonight and I don't wake up in the
[1:16:14] morning I want to have that assurance
[1:16:16] that everything is good everything is
[1:16:19] done I've got the ticket and when the
[1:16:22] boat pulls away from the dock there'll
[1:16:23] be no interference hallelujah Oh sister
[1:16:27] Amy would you come Oh hallelujah maybe
[1:16:30] this sounds like a strange way to
[1:16:32] encourage you but my brother and sister
[1:16:35] be encouraged all we got to do is each
[1:16:39] and every day look at the soul examine
[1:16:43] it
[1:16:43] ask the Lord father Lord Jesus if there
[1:16:47] is something in my life

[1:17:29] something that you have to labor under

[1:17:46] morning noon and night
[1:17:50] Lord prepare me I want to be your
[1:17:55] sanctuary I wanted my life to be just an
[1:17:59] open clean slate then I can present it
[1:18:03] to you Lord without fear without
[1:18:07] apprehension then I can just freely come
[1:18:11] my brother and sister that's what makes
