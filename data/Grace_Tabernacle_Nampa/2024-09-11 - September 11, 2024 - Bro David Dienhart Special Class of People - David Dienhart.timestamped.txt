[29:46] have it revealed to us it's got to be
[29:49] revealed and the only one that can
[29:50] reveal it is him amen so while you're
[29:54] standing I'd like you to turn to St John
[29:56] have scriptures here tonight tonight I
[29:59] don't have very much but we know that
[30:02] little is much when God is in it so we
[30:06] know that he can make little
[30:09] much and so my title tonight is the
[30:13] light of the life part two the light of
[30:17] the life part two and I had part
[30:22] one and uh if you recall we showed there
[30:26] where when we read this scripture here
[30:28] in St John that uh you were his witness
[30:32] before the foundation of the world you
[30:34] were with him in the beginning and in
[30:37] his thought amen so let us read here in
[30:40] St John 1 beginning with the first verse
[30:43] in the beginning was the word and the
[30:46] Word was with God how was it with God as
[30:49] is thought where were
[30:51] you in that thought you were
[30:55] existing you were real in the thought
[30:59] can't hear me well you may have to turn
[31:02] it up a little bit brother if they can't
[31:04] hear me I'm I'm a little bit horse
[31:07] tonight so I didn't say I was a horse
[31:10] I'm a little horse tonight amen don't
[31:14] get it wrong now and say David said he
[31:16] was a horse I wonder what kind well
[31:18] you're going to call me a horse call me
[31:19] a white horse would you amen so all
[31:23] right but I but I'm a little horse so in
[31:25] the beginning was the word and the the
[31:28] word was with God and the Word was God
[31:33] Amen that thought expressed was
[31:37] God and it was with him and and that's
[31:39] where you became expressed so you're in
[31:42] the word to begin with if you're his
[31:46] bride the same was in the beginning with
[31:48] God verse three all things were made by
[31:50] him and without him was not anything
[31:53] made that was made in him was life and
[31:57] the life was the light of men in him was
[32:03] life would that be
[32:05] Eternal certainly would because he can't
[32:08] be anything else but eternal life
[32:09] there's only one form of eternal life
[32:11] that's right so in him was life and the
[32:14] life was the light and so when you see
[32:17] life manifested it is light of men the
[32:21] light shineth in darkness watch and the
[32:24] Darkness comprehended it not they can't
[32:28] comprehend the light they can't
[32:31] comprehend the manifestation of the Life
[32:34] of Christ but the bride thrives on it
[32:38] amen I'd like you to turn with me to
[32:40] Matthew chapter 14 or chapter 5 excuse
[32:43] me Matthew Chapter 5 and verse
[32:52] 14 ye are the light of the world a a
[32:59] city amen find over Revelations 21 that
[33:02] she's a city the bride is the city amen
[33:06] and you are the light of the world a
[33:08] city that is set on a hill cannot be hid
[33:13] the Lord amen neither do men put a light
[33:17] do men light a candle and put it under a
[33:20] bushel but on the
[33:24] Candlestick and it giveth light unto all
[33:27] that are watch in the house I wonder
[33:31] what house that would
[33:33] be Lord see we each one are
[33:37] light to those in the
[33:40] house and let your light so shine let
[33:44] your light so shine before men that they
[33:47] may see your good
[33:49] works and glorify your father which is

[39:31] that bringeth forth his fruit in his
[39:34] season his Leaf also shall not wither

[42:49] seed amen you can you say I'm well I'm
[42:52] the body but it passes
[42:54] away but if that seed's not there it'll
[42:56] never rck again so the seed had to be
[43:00] there amen all right I'll raise it up
[43:04] again the last days that's right you
[43:07] said he said or brother brand referring
[43:10] to you said Lord you said I the Lord
[43:13] hath planted
[43:15] it I the Lord hath planted
[43:18] it why certainly you put it on the
[43:21] Lamb's Book of Life before the
[43:23] foundation of the world I the Lord hath
[43:26] planted it I'll Water it day and night
[43:28] unless some should pluck it from my hand
[43:32] so what's it going to take it's going to
[43:34] take that seed in you
[43:37] planted for you to be in the
[43:41] Rapture amen for you to be in the bride
[43:44] that seed has to be planted in you
[43:46] before the world
[43:48] began amen all right amen so it's not
[43:54] it's not another person it is the it is
[43:57] him the person in seed form planted in
[44:00] you now it's got to come to life in its
[44:05] season this is your
[44:08] season amen amen you're in seed time
[44:11] you're in the bride time you're in the
[44:13] bright age this is your
[44:15] season all right I the Lord that planted
[44:18] it I'll Water it day and night look
[44:20] who's caring for it he said I'll Water
[44:22] it day and night oh yeah you think he's
[44:25] able to carry out his promise
[44:27] you think he's able to carry out his
[44:30] word doesn't look like there's too many
[44:32] does there but he's going to do it he
[44:35] has his elect for this hour this day
[44:38] that's going to Manifest this day and
[44:40] this
[44:42] hour amen because they have an ability
[44:45] to hear the word of God for the
[44:50] season all right and that here is to
[44:53] know and to hear and to receive what the
[44:55] spirit's saying you know know what he's
[44:58] saying no one no one else does she does
[45:02] he does the seed does amen
[45:06] amen no one else has that
[45:10] ability amen you can hear it a lot of
[45:13] people hear it but they don't see
[45:16] it I don't talk about hear see here I'm
[45:19] talk about see with their heart they
[45:20] don't see it why don't they see it or
[45:23] other words they can't receive it they
[45:25] can't receive it and they're good people
[45:28] wonderful people even people will be
[45:31] saved at the Judgment were that kind of
[45:33] people but they aren't in the bride
[45:36] because they can't come through the
[45:39] blood the only thing that can come
[45:41] through the blood is his life is his
[45:43] seed that's it okay keep that in
[45:47] mind I want you to turn with me to St
[45:50] John
[45:54] three I was going to read this a little
[45:56] later here but I'll just read it right
[45:57] now St John
[46:13] 3 and starting with verse three this
[46:16] Jesus is meeting
[46:18] Nicodemus we know the story we've read
[46:20] it but in starting verse Jesus answered
[46:23] and said unto him verily verily I say
[46:27] unto
[46:28] you now he just got done saying there's
[46:30] no man can do these works we know
[46:32] there's no man can do these works except
[46:34] God be with
[46:36] him but then so Jesus answers and said
[46:39] answered and said unto him verily verily
[46:41] I say unto you except a man be born
[46:44] again he cannot see that word see there
[46:48] is not physical sight right it's the
[46:52] understanding the revelation of the
[46:54] kingdom of God and except he be born
[46:57] again and that word Born Again means
[47:01] literally from
[47:03] above except a man be born again or from
[47:08] above he cannot see the kingdom of God
[47:11] the kingdom of God is the word which is
[47:15] God made life and spirit power in your
[47:19] life that's the kingdom of God so the
[47:23] kingdom of God is the word made Power
[47:25] made life in you
[47:30] amen all right we could we could find
[47:32] that in 1 Corinthians 4 if you were
[47:35] wanting to look it up all right so he
[47:39] said no man can see the kingdom of God
[47:41] except be born
[47:43] again and so so Nicodemus saith him how
[47:46] can a man be born when he is old see
[47:49] he's got his mind on the on the on the
[47:52] flesh
[47:53] man he he said how can this be he's only
[47:56] got one birth in sight and that's a
[47:57] natural birth Jesus wasn't speaking of
[48:01] the natural birth here amen because if
[48:04] he's born of God it wouldn't it would
[48:06] not be a a natural it would have to be a
[48:09] spiritual birth because God is a
[48:13] spirit that right sure he brings forth
[48:16] the natural it's a law but but he the
[48:20] the birth comes from the spoken word the
[48:22] birth of God the birth or Born Again
[48:25] comes from the word spoken
[48:27] amen and that's exactly what he was God
[48:30] was with Jesus because he was the word
[48:34] the spoken word made manifest he didn't
[48:37] come through woman he never came through
[48:38] flesh sex he wasn't born of Flesh he was
[48:42] born of
[48:44] God you say well he was a man yes he was
[48:46] he came through a woman but he didn't
[48:48] come by sexual he didn't come by man's
[48:51] he didn't come by man or by sensation of
[48:54] man he came by the spoken word and if
[48:58] you're born again you'll come the same
[48:59] way by Spoken Word not not born in a
[49:03] through a woman virgin like he was but
[49:05] the spiritual birth inside of you is a
[49:08] word spoken in its season made manifest
[49:10] in you because that word spoken goes to
[49:13] you go and will go to that seed and then
[49:17] the word meets the
[49:20] word amen all right so you so if you
[49:25] have 2 plus two
[49:28] if the word meets the word what are you
[49:29] going to have the
[49:33] word amen all right so he said so we go
[49:38] on reading here verse six or five verily
[49:41] verily I say unto you except the man be
[49:43] born of water and of the spirit he
[49:46] cannot enter into the kingdom of
[49:51] God now that's God's word you just you
[49:53] can't come in any other way
[49:57] that which is born of the
[49:59] flesh is
[50:02] flesh but that which is born of the
[50:04] spirit I Jesus is bringing this right
[50:07] down Clarity but that which is born of
[50:09] the spirit is
[50:12] spirit that which is you can't divide
[50:14] you can't separate God from his
[50:16] word God and His word are the are one
[50:20] you'll never divide them or separate
[50:21] them wherever God is the word is
[50:27] amen amen well you say what about the
[50:30] tribulation Saint what about what about
[50:32] those
[50:34] that
[50:35] see they have the don't they have the
[50:38] word yes but they only have it as an
[50:40] intellectual understanding not
[50:43] Revelation okay we'll we'll just speak
[50:45] of that maybe if as we go here just
[50:48] shortly in verse eight in verse 7 he
[50:51] said Marvel not that I said unto you you
[50:54] must be born again the watch this eth
[50:57] verse the wind the wind what is the wind
[51:01] typing the Holy Spirit okay the wind
[51:07] bloweth where it listeth I want to I
[51:09] want to cover these words here in just a
[51:11] few minutes few just in a moment the BL
[51:14] the wind bloweth where it
[51:17] listeth and thou hearest the sound
[51:20] thereof but cannot tell whence it cometh
[51:23] or whether whether it goeth now watch
[51:27] what he says so is
[51:29] everyone that is born of the
[51:32] spirit kind of strange they're kind of
[51:35] unusual to the Natural man the flesh man
[51:38] because he cannot
[51:40] discern that Spirit unless he has that
[51:43] spirit of God in
[51:45] him can't receive it all right so
[51:50] so now hold that right there I'm not
[51:52] going to read any further if we go to
[51:55] First Corinthians and you don't have to
[51:57] turn here just want to listen I want to
[51:59] go to 1 Corinthians the 15th chapter and
[52:02] it says here in the 45th verse through
[52:05] 48 it says so it is written the first
[52:08] man Adam was made a living Soul the last
[52:12] Adam though you should have first Adam
[52:14] now the second
[52:15] Adam the last Adam is made what a
[52:19] quickening spirit yes remember he that's
[52:23] born of the spirit is Spirit right all
[52:27] right okay then it goes how be it that
[52:31] was not first which is spiritual but
[52:34] that which is natural and afterward that
[52:37] which is
[52:39] spiritual the first man is of the earth
[52:42] earthy the second man is the Lord From
[52:48] Heaven amen the second man the
[52:52] birth from above is the Lord From Heaven
[52:57] right
[52:58] amen all right now how be it that was
[53:02] not okay it was spiritual okay then from
[53:05] Heaven 48 as as is the earthy such are
[53:10] they also that are earthy and is see
[53:14] Jesus said the same thing you're born of
[53:16] flesh is
[53:18] flesh as is the Heavenly such are they
[53:21] also that are that such are they also
[53:24] that are heavenly
[53:29] so see where' you come from from
[53:33] above a Heavenly you are a Heavenly
[53:37] being you brother brandom said you are
[53:38] an eternal being
[53:40] inside and the inside is going to
[53:43] produce that
[53:44] outside amen going to bring it to the
[53:47] outside you're going to be
[53:49] changed and what's Heavenly in you you

[53:54] from heaven and now you're dwelling in
[53:55] heaven yeah
[53:58] inside well I don't feel like heaven out
[54:00] here but you quit looking at this you'll
[54:02] realize where you're
[54:05] at okay so there's a Heavenly being here
[54:09] right here in this Tabernacle this
[54:11] evening birth word the birth word is a
[54:14] Heavenly
[54:15] being it's the Holy Ghost it's the word
[54:20] himself all
[54:24] right I only had to read the
[54:28] yeah well I'll just go on and as we have
[54:30] borne the image of the Earthly we shall
[54:33] also bear the image of the
[54:36] Heavenly now I say Brethren that flesh
[54:38] and blood cannot inherit the kingdom of
[54:40] God neither do corruption inherit
[54:43] incorruption and then he says I'll show
[54:45] you mystery we're not all sleep but we
[54:47] shall be changed amen now in the me in
[54:51] the church age book The Prophet said and
[54:54] I'll come back to these meanings here in
[54:56] the e8th verse here just in John
[54:59] 3:8 yes Church age book He said Yes
[55:02] Satan hates
[55:04] Revelation Satan hates
[55:07] it but watch what he's butt we love it
[55:10] amen who loves the Revelation because
[55:13] the revelation of the word can the Gates
[55:15] of Hell cannot Prevail against a true
[55:17] revelation of the
[55:20] word remember Jesus said himself I'll
[55:22] build my church upon the revelation of
[55:25] who I am
[55:26] that's why the new birth is the
[55:28] revelation of Jesus Christ has begun in
[55:30] you and will grow into the very person
[55:32] himself because that's the person you
[55:35] are that person

[56:01] lives the Gates of Hell cannot cannot
[56:04] Prevail against
[56:08] us hallelujah but we will we will
[56:12] prevail over them amen now brother
[56:16] sister bride you have an anointed
[56:17] position prise the Lord when you
[56:20] recognize your position that you are the
[56:22] word living and in action there's not a
[56:26] devil at any time at any place under any
[56:28] circumstance can stand up against that
[56:31] as long as you hold that before him
[56:34] amen amen he can't do it you can go back
[56:37] to the word and say it's written of me
[56:40] go back to the word and say this word
[56:42] right here is the revelation of who I
[56:46] am amen it's a full revelation of Jesus
[56:49] Christ and I'm part of that full
[56:51] Revelation the Lord yes sir and he
[56:54] cannot be complete until she comes on
[56:56] the scene today because you being that
[56:59] seed quickened in this hour reveal
[57:01] manifesting the promised word of the
[57:03] hour because you have an ear to receive
[57:05] and hear
[57:06] it amen it's revealed to
[57:10] you the gates of hell can't Prevail
[57:12] against that amen there's no way it can
[57:15] stand against it you're going to go on
[57:19] you're moving on what's leading you the
[57:22] pillar of fire just like our brother
[57:24] brought Sunday what is is it that you
[57:26] are you're that living fire you're that
[57:28] Living Word you are that
[57:30] shakina you go in there the prophet said
[57:33] on the unveiling of God he was trying to
[57:35] show who the bride was they're the
[57:36] unveiling of
[57:38] God see because that unveiling makes you
[57:41] the complete revelation of the whole
[57:43] thing the revelation of God in you makes
[57:46] you the complete revelation of the whole
[57:47] thing the complete revelation of Christ
[57:51] am amen you see where we're
[57:54] at amen right and so so here he said you
[57:59] will recall he says that I mentioned at
[58:02] the beginning of this message that this
[58:04] book we are studying which is the Book
[58:06] of Revelations is the actual revelation
[58:08] of Jesus himself in the
[58:13] church and his and and it is his work in
[58:17] the future
[58:19] ages his
[58:23] work let your light so shine
[58:27] amen that they may see your Works whose
[58:30] works is it is it David's Works no it's
[58:34] his
[58:35] work it's his works and will'll glorify
[58:38] what David no they'll glorify your
[58:41] father because is your your life is
[58:44] testifying light to them that this life
[58:47] is manifested now present living in
[58:51] flesh Jesus Christ the same yesterday
[58:54] and today and forever amen
[58:57] all right and he saidou recall so we see
[59:00] he said his work in the future Then I
[59:03] then I mentioned that it takes the Holy
[59:05] Spirit to give us Revelation or we will
[59:07] fail to get it
[59:10] right how does faith
[59:13] come by hearing the
[59:16] word
[59:20] amen he said bringing these two thoughts
[59:23] together you will see that it won't take
[59:26] just ordinary
[59:28] study and thinking to make this book
[59:32] real ordinary study and thinking it's
[59:35] going to take the operation of the Holy
[59:38] Ghost it's going to take the operation
[59:41] of the Holy Ghost if you hold that
[59:43] operation and see it operating in you
[59:45] what kind of evidence and what
[59:47] identification do you have who is what
[59:50] is your
[59:52] identification all right see operation
[59:55] of the Holy Ghost that means this
[59:57] book cannot be revealed what is this
[1:00:01] book the Lamb's
[1:00:03] Book the bride
[1:00:05] book The Book of Life the Lamb's Book of
[1:00:10] Life he said this book cannot be
[1:00:14] revealed to anyone but a special class
[1:00:18] of
[1:00:20] people so now you see where my my
[1:00:23] subject is a special class
[1:00:26] they're the ones that receive that
[1:00:28] receive the Revelation they are the ones
[1:00:31] that receive the revelation of the hour
[1:00:32] and the
[1:00:34] day you don't have to pump that up it's
[1:00:38] in them to be it it's in them they they
[1:00:41] hear the voice they're going to respond
[1:00:43] to the voice other words we just read
[1:00:45] here in St John
[1:00:47] 3:8 that and that the wind bloweth where
[1:00:51] it list and thou hearest the
[1:00:54] sound thereof
[1:00:56] thou hearest the sound some will hear
[1:00:59] the sound and don't know where it come
[1:01:00] from they'll hear the sound but can't
[1:01:03] can't receive that
[1:01:05] sound and that sound is a
[1:01:09] voice even the Greek meaning of it was
[1:01:12] voice all right so so he he goes in to
[1:01:17] say he said it'll take this means the
[1:01:19] book can't be revealed to anyone but a
[1:01:21] special class of people it will take one
[1:01:23] with prophetic insight
[1:01:26] it will require and here's it is right
[1:01:29] here you have bride you you bride you
[1:01:33] elect of God you seed of
[1:01:37] God you that have been accepted in the
[1:01:40] Beloved you that have been chosen in him
[1:01:42] before the foundation world how do you
[1:01:44] know Brother David because it's revealed
[1:01:46] to me in the word and Vindicated thus
[1:01:49] it's already it's already
[1:01:54] proven because it does I don't have to
[1:01:56] make it happen it lives
[1:02:00] itself amen it will take one with
[1:02:03] prophetic Insight it will require the
[1:02:05] ability to hear from God you have the
[1:02:08] ability to hear from God not everybody
[1:02:13] has that ability only the bride has that
[1:02:16] ability to hear from God and when you
[1:02:19] hear from God when you see it when you
[1:02:21] hear it the word dovetailing itself
[1:02:23] coming together and hearing what the
[1:02:26] spirit's saying you can't produce and
[1:02:28] give that to somebody else
[1:02:33] right not unless they have that seed in
[1:02:36] them then you speak that revelation we
[1:02:39] speak that voice we speak that sound and
[1:02:42] they can hear
[1:02:43] that because Jesus said my sheep hear my
[1:02:46] voice and a stranger they'll not
[1:02:49] follow see so it's coming to a special
[1:02:52] class of people it will take it will
[1:02:54] require the ability to hear from God it
[1:02:57] will require prophetic
[1:03:03] Insight it will require Supernatural
[1:03:08] instruction not just a student and you
[1:03:11] know you say well you get pressured up
[1:03:12] well I got to find that instruction I

[1:03:59] light you see the message is God is
[1:04:02] light actually I didn't even intend to
[1:04:05] read St John 1 1-5 but I did you know
[1:04:08] what my scripture was first John 1
[1:04:14] 1-5 God has his way let's go to First
[1:04:18] John because now's the time to read
[1:04:23] it let's go to First John 1 that that
[1:04:25] which was from the
[1:04:27] beginning which we have heard there it
[1:04:31] is you see oh I love the way God does
[1:04:34] things that's all there is to it it goes
[1:04:36] beyond the man goes beyond man's ideas
[1:04:39] man's thinking man's intellect it's the
[1:04:42] working and achievement of God himself
[1:04:45] when you realize that bride you're
[1:04:47] released you're free there's no such a
[1:04:49] thing is being under bondage he has not
[1:04:51] given you the spirit of bondage but he's
[1:04:54] given you the spirit of adoption full
[1:04:57] adoption full
[1:04:58] placing brother BR listen we have the
[1:05:01] message we have the Capstone Ministry to
[1:05:03] cap off the Pyramid of your
[1:05:07] life amen that's exactly
[1:05:09] right amen bring you to the very person
[1:05:12] you are Lord and your position is that

[1:05:21] that
[1:05:22] person amen hallelujah
[1:05:29] all right so let's read again that which
[1:05:32] was from the beginnings 1 John 1:1 which
[1:05:35] we have
[1:05:37] heard which we have seen with our eyes
[1:05:41] which we have looked upon and our hands
[1:05:43] have handled of the word of life for
[1:05:48] because or for the life was manifested
[1:05:51] and we have seen it and bear Witness and
[1:05:55] show unto you that eternal life which
[1:05:59] was with the father and was manifested
[1:06:02] unto
[1:06:04] us that which we have seen and heard
[1:06:08] there you are Glory declare we unto you
[1:06:12] that you also may have fellowship with
[1:06:14] us and truly our fellowship is with the
[1:06:17] father and with his son Jesus
[1:06:19] Christ so where do you stand in this the
[1:06:23] complete revelation of the godhead amen
[1:06:26] that's
[1:06:27] right that's exactly right amen he's not
[1:06:31] perfect without a
[1:06:33] bride father son Holy Ghost you know
[1:06:36] what brother Bram said about father son
[1:06:39] holy ghost in you he said father son
[1:06:47] bride amen all
[1:06:50] right truly our fellowship was with the
[1:06:52] father with his son Jesus Christ this
[1:06:55] then this is what brought it back here
[1:06:57] this then is the message
[1:07:00] yes this then is the message to a
[1:07:03] special class of people that he said
[1:07:06] Rise and Shine for thy light what is the
[1:07:08] message God is
[1:07:12] light then who are
[1:07:14] you God is light and he just got done
[1:07:17] saying you're the light this then is the
[1:07:21] message you're the light
[1:07:26] amen amen you're the light how because
[1:07:29] he planted that seed and you were
[1:07:32] ordained for this day and you can't miss
[1:07:34] it there's I don't care I you will not
[1:07:37] miss it it's impossible to miss
[1:07:41] it no the bride will miss it she
[1:07:45] can't that's just all there is to it if
[1:07:48] if she misses it he missed
[1:07:52] it and his works are perfect all of his
[1:07:55] works are perfect and he said and you
[1:07:57] and he has made your all of his way is
[1:08:00] perfect excuse me all his way his works
[1:08:02] are yes of course but his way is perfect
[1:08:04] and he said he had made your way
[1:08:08] perfect
[1:08:10] amen all right so this is the message
[1:08:13] we've heard of him declaring to you that
[1:08:15] God is light and in him is no Darkness
[1:08:17] at
[1:08:19] all now we'll come to another scripture
[1:08:21] here in just a minute and I'm I'm not
[1:08:24] going to take too much longer here it is
[1:08:26] the
[1:08:27] Revelation no excuse me it will require
[1:08:29] Supernatural struction instruction not
[1:08:32] just a student comparing verse with
[1:08:34] verse though that is good but a mystery
[1:08:37] requires the teaching inside teacher
[1:08:40] can't you rely upon that inside teacher
[1:08:42] that has unveiled himself in you and you
[1:08:44] know it that's right amen yes
[1:08:47] sir you're
[1:08:49] identified he's an inside
[1:08:52] teacher amen and it'll it it's it and it
[1:08:56] requires the teaching of the spirit or
[1:08:58] it never becomes
[1:09:00] clear how we need to hear from God and
[1:09:03] lay ourselves open that's it right there
[1:09:06] how we need to hear from God and lay
[1:09:09] ourself on the altar lay yourself
[1:09:14] open and become yielded to the spirit to
[1:09:19] hear and
[1:09:23] know it is the revelation of God that
[1:09:25] will give you the authority over the
[1:09:28] devil it is the revelation of god notice
[1:09:31] the revelation of God revelation of who
[1:09:35] the revelation of God that will give you
[1:09:37] authority over the
[1:09:41] devil and you can see why they would
[1:09:46] they you can see why they who would add
[1:09:49] or take away from it would be cursed it
[1:09:53] would it would have to be so for who can
[1:09:55] add or take away from the perfect
[1:09:57] revelation of God and overcome the enemy
[1:10:01] it is that simple there is nothing of
[1:10:05] such prevailing power as the revelation
[1:10:08] of the
[1:10:11] word now let's look at this St John 38
[1:10:15] let's take this word in St John 38 let
[1:10:18] me go back here to it
[1:10:27] John 3 John
[1:10:32] 38 oh I can't find it in Matthew
[1:10:41] okay 38 the wind bloweth where it
[1:10:44] listeth the word
[1:10:46] listeth means a will or desire a will of
[1:10:51] Mind a tendency a choosing of his mind
[1:10:56] is the will the lth mean it's under
[1:10:59] Direction the wind is under Direction
[1:11:01] it's directed The Wind where it'll blow
[1:11:04] where it listeth it means it's blowing
[1:11:06] where it's dire it's it's directed to
[1:11:09] go it h it's it's
[1:11:12] purposed it's determined according to
[1:11:16] his
[1:11:18] pleasure the wind will blow where it
[1:11:20] listeth where he wills
[1:11:23] it amen all right now you're under see
[1:11:27] you're you're under not flesh
[1:11:29] here carnal thinking carnal man you're
[1:11:33] led by the pillar of
[1:11:36] fire the Lord
[1:11:40] himself and then where it listeth and
[1:11:43] thou hearest the sound heareth heareth
[1:11:46] hearken and thou hearken and gives
[1:11:49] attendance to the sound consider what is
[1:11:52] or has been said hearing means
[1:11:55] considering attending to it and what has
[1:11:59] been said and the sound heareth the
[1:12:01] sound the sound is a voice speech
[1:12:04] language a
[1:12:06] tongue it speaks it's a voice if we go
[1:12:11] to 1 John
[1:12:12] 4:6 it said that the bride being born
[1:12:15] again has a
[1:12:18] voice amen and it's the voice of him we
[1:12:22] are of God we are of God verse 6 chapter
[1:12:26] 4 verse John 46 we are of God he that
[1:12:30] knoweth God heareth
[1:12:33] us there it is they hear the
[1:12:38] sound but they can't determine where it
[1:12:41] come from now watch because we're going
[1:12:43] on here let's just pick that up so they
[1:12:45] hear the
[1:12:49] sound and can't not tell discern or
[1:12:54] perceive
[1:12:56] where it went from where from where it's
[1:13:00] from or from what or how or
[1:13:03] why they don't know why where it's from
[1:13:07] what it's for or
[1:13:11] why whence it cometh and and do we see
[1:13:14] that today my
[1:13:17] yes they don't get
[1:13:22] it amen I'm not talking about the world
[1:13:24] out here they don't get get it either
[1:13:26] but we're talking about whether they
[1:13:27] have an ear to hear or not whether that
[1:13:30] seed's laying there the all perect you
[1:13:33] know all profess the message but what is
[1:13:36] it who is
[1:13:39] it amen it's living right here where is
[1:13:43] it living amen it's moving in his body
[1:13:47] it's moving in you in his house and so
[1:13:51] they cannot tell whence it cometh and
[1:13:53] whether it goeth whether is some where
[1:13:55] somewhere it's gone or about how it is
[1:13:57] or how it goes or where it goes about it
[1:14:00] they don't know about
[1:14:03] it so is everyone that is born of the
[1:14:06] spirit and so 1 John 4:6 said we are of
[1:14:09] God and he that knoweth God heareth us
[1:14:11] he that's not of God heareth not
[1:14:13] us hereby know we the spirit of truth
[1:14:17] and the spirit of
[1:14:19] error you mean there's a people like
[1:14:21] this in the land Brother David
[1:14:25] that would
[1:14:26] know
[1:14:28] perceiving hearing and knowing where
[1:14:30] that where that where that wind is
[1:14:33] blowing and where it's going and where
[1:14:34] it's come from and where it's going
[1:14:35] let's look at St John 8 here a moment St
[1:14:40] John chapter
[1:14:41] 8 and let's look at the 12th
[1:14:49] verse then Jesus spake again unto them
[1:14:52] saying I am the light
[1:14:55] of the
[1:14:57] world now I just got done saying he said
[1:15:00] I am the light of the world he said you
[1:15:04] are I am the light of the world other
[1:15:07] words what he is you
[1:15:10] are he that followeth me shall not walk
[1:15:14] in darkness see he that followeth me
[1:15:18] shall not walk in darkness but shall
[1:15:20] have the light of life
[1:15:26] the Pharisees therefore said unto him
[1:15:28] thou bearest record of thyself thy
[1:15:31] record is not true Jesus answered and
[1:15:33] said unto them though I bear record of
[1:15:35] myself yet I know yet my record is true
[1:15:40] for I know watch what he says here for I
[1:15:42] know whence I
[1:15:44] came I know where I've come from
[1:15:50] right take it over to St John 38 again I
[1:15:54] know where I've come from I know where
[1:15:56] that wind's Le blowing I know where it's
[1:15:59] leading me I know where it's come from I
[1:16:01] know where it's
[1:16:04] going amen it's on the move you you you
[1:16:08] realize the holy spirit's on the Move
[1:16:10] yes sir where are they moving where are
[1:16:11] they marching we're heading out of here
[1:16:13] we're marching and step with the word
[1:16:16] they're marching he saw them marching he
[1:16:18] saw them on the
[1:16:20] Move amen leaving here it's happening
[1:16:24] yes
[1:16:26] amen all right he
[1:16:29] said and then he goes on and says 14th
[1:16:32] verse then Jesus answered said though I
[1:16:34] bear record myself yet my record is true
[1:16:36] for I know whence I came and whether I
[1:16:38] go just exactly they don't know where
[1:16:40] he's come where it's come from and
[1:16:41] whether where it's going they hear it
[1:16:44] but they don't know the sound of it they
[1:16:46] can't discern they can't perceive the
[1:16:51] sound amen if you perceive and hear the
[1:16:53] sound and know the sound what is that
[1:16:55] saying to you as an
[1:17:01] individual all right then he says here
[1:17:03] the fif four 15th verse you judge after
[1:17:07] the flesh look at what what he went
[1:17:09] right back to him he said you're judging
[1:17:11] after the flesh he said I judge no man
[1:17:14] after the flesh I don't judge after the
[1:17:16] flesh if God judged us after the flesh
[1:17:19] we're done we're
[1:17:21] gone but he's not judging us after the
[1:17:23] flesh he morning a flesh is flesh you
[1:17:26] judge after the flesh you're looking at
[1:17:27] the
[1:17:28] flesh I don't judge after the flesh I
[1:17:32] judge the spirit I know my
[1:17:36] own they are my they are me that's me
[1:17:40] there all right I don't judge after the
[1:17:42] flesh all right
[1:17:47] now in the 23rd verse he said and they
[1:17:51] said and he said unto them you are from
[1:17:53] beneath
[1:17:55] I am from above ye are of this world I
[1:17:59] am not of this world neither are you
[1:18:03] neither am I I'm not of this
[1:18:07] world I'm from
[1:18:09] above I'm not boasting I'm a special
[1:18:14] person he made me that I didn't make
[1:18:16] myself that he made me that it takes a I
[1:18:19] mean I'm sorry I'm a special class I'm

[1:18:29] Bride amen I'll call you bride it went
[1:18:32] from church bride to
[1:18:35] bride amen all right
[1:18:39] now Jesus said himself you cannot hear
[1:18:42] my word Therefore your father he said
[1:18:44] right in verse 47 he said he that is of
[1:18:47] God heareth God's words ye therefore
[1:18:50] hear them not because you're not of God
[1:18:52] verse 43 why you do not understand my
[1:18:54] speech even because you cannot hear my
[1:18:57] word in every age there's been that
[1:19:01] original that seed that would be able to
[1:19:03] hear and respond and hear the word for
[1:19:06] that
[1:19:09] age amen they they could receive they
[1:19:12] heard the word for their age but they
[1:19:15] could not be made perfect until the
[1:19:17] seals were opened without us amen they
[1:19:22] couldn't be made perfect complete right
[1:19:25] until the Capstone unveiled itself
[1:19:28] amen and United with him and and then
[1:19:31] they with us are
[1:19:35] complete amen it's all one they lived

[1:19:42] Spirit to recognize to know the word for
[1:19:45] their season they were able to hear what
[1:19:47] the spirit said in that age in that time
[1:19:51] that's always been the True Believer all
[1:19:54] the way through until right till right
[1:19:56] this present
[1:19:58] time and they were never large in number
[1:20:01] they were small in
[1:20:03] number I don't know the number I don't
[1:20:06] concerned about the number I just know I
[1:20:08] am as an individual in that
[1:20:11] number and brother Ram if you don't have

[1:22:16] and everybody shout and praise the Lord
[1:22:18] and all get anointed by the
[1:22:20] spirit and go on out there and now they
[1:22:23] need another filling yeah and we need
[1:22:25] fillings I'm not questioning that but th
[1:22:27] they ran out the the lamps get black
[1:22:31] they run out you've got a other words

[1:23:17] there they don't have that Spirit of
[1:23:19] Revelation be able to hear that word
[1:23:21] spoken

[1:23:44] that word and when the word was
[1:23:46] quickened what did it produce it was God

[1:24:15] couldn't get the revelation of the day
[1:24:17] and the hour they're living in why
[1:24:19] because they weren't predestinated to
[1:24:21] that position
[1:24:25] they took their lamps they took no oil
[1:24:26] in the vessel they ran out well go buy
[1:24:30] some God was giving it when did he get
[1:24:33] it he gave it freely but they couldn't
[1:24:34] buy they couldn't manufacture something
[1:24:36] and go buy
[1:24:38] it and we're not going to give you ours
[1:24:40] because we got enough to go
[1:24:43] in you go get it other words you go get
[1:24:46] it where we got it
[1:24:51] yes they didn't the prophet said they
[1:24:53] didn't
[1:24:55] if you want to hear what he said he said
[1:24:57] they didn't get
[1:25:01] it that's what he said they didn't get
[1:25:04] it they went to get it and they didn't
[1:25:07] get
[1:25:09] it they couldn't get it because if they
[1:25:13] got it if that seed they weren't seed of
[1:25:16] God they were
[1:25:18] remnant of the life they were Remnant
[1:25:21] they weren't the
[1:25:23] seed amen amen amen they they couldn't
[1:25:27] if they were seed they'd go beyond they
[1:25:28] could go beneath they could go beyond
[1:25:30] the blood they could come through the
[1:25:31] blood how can you stop the seed from
[1:25:33] coming through the blood amen into his
[1:25:36] very presence because the prophet said
[1:25:39] this now watch he said this he said he's
[1:25:43] an
[1:25:43] eagle this Eagle now let's let's come to
[1:25:47] a conclusion first of all let's say
[1:25:49] this now then we are coming to a
[1:25:52] conclusion so are we we're closing as
[1:25:54] the Eternal logos was manifested in the
[1:25:56] Sun and Jesus dwelt G in G in Jesus
[1:26:00] dwelt all the fullness of the godhead
[1:26:02] bodily and that Eternal one was the
[1:26:04] father manifested in
[1:26:07] flesh and thereby gained the title of
[1:26:10] son even so we Eternal in his thoughts
[1:26:14] in our turn became the many membered
[1:26:17] spoken word seed manifested in flesh and
[1:26:20] those Eternal thoughts now manifest in
[1:26:23] flesh are the sons of God even as we as
[1:26:27] we are soall we did not become seed by
[1:26:32] rebirth we were seed and therefore we
[1:26:36] were
[1:26:37] reborn for only the elect can be reborn
[1:26:40] remember the scripture said he sent the
[1:26:42] spirit of his
[1:26:45] son in
[1:26:47] you Galatians 4 and because you are Sons
[1:26:52] he sent the spirit of his son in
[1:26:57] you to you in you quickened you
[1:27:00] quickened that seed brought it to
[1:27:08] life and the and the elect and therefore
[1:27:12] they were reborn for only the elect can
[1:27:15] be
[1:27:16] reborn only the elect can be
[1:27:20] reborn foolish virgins were not born
[1:27:23] again
[1:27:28] in fact they did not they did not have
[1:27:30] the Holy Spirit in that
[1:27:33] Soul
[1:27:35] dwelling oh they had the anointing they
[1:27:37] had the word out there on the outer on
[1:27:39] that outer side but not in
[1:27:44] there CU if they had it in there they
[1:27:46] would have had it to begin with in
[1:27:49] there amen are you with me and then in
[1:27:51] their age they would have received that
[1:27:53] word right because why I'm coming right
[1:27:56] to it here he said because they were
[1:27:59] seed is the reason they could be
[1:28:00] quickened in nonseed there's nothing to
[1:28:03] Quicken all right this eagle out here
[1:28:07] hunts for hunts for his
[1:28:09] mama he recognizes the real Eagle
[1:28:13] recognizes the call of God's word why he
[1:28:16] recognizes
[1:28:19] it why he's an eagle an eagle to an
[1:28:22] eagle an eagle to an eagle amen the word
[1:28:26] before the foundation the word to the
[1:28:29] word so it's the word coming to the
[1:28:35] word amen watch how he says it here he
[1:28:38] said the word
[1:28:40] predestinated to the word written for
[1:28:44] the
[1:28:45] hour you realize your position and you
[1:28:49] know
[1:28:52] what he's so running to obtain he hunts
[1:28:55] for
[1:28:58] it amen are you with me he hunts for
[1:29:02] it he doesn't set on a wire up there
[1:29:05] expecting to expecting some car to run
[1:29:07] over a dead kill a rabbit he's hunting
[1:29:10] for it he hasn't lost she hasn't lost
[1:29:14] her identification she hunts for
[1:29:17] it it's there it's in the word amen it's
[1:29:21] word coming to word the word
[1:29:23] predestinated there's a word written for
[1:29:24] this hour and the two meet yes it was
[1:29:28] already
[1:29:29] there it was already in the
[1:29:34] vessel amen the other didn't have it in
[1:29:37] the
[1:29:39] vessel amen all right I hope you
[1:29:43] understand all right
[1:29:45] now you recognize your position now
[1:29:48] let's go to Matthew and I'm closing
[1:29:50] Matthew 11 just about five more minutes
[1:29:52] 11 Matthew
[1:29:54] 11: I don't even know what time it is so
[1:29:57] forgive me if I run over your
[1:29:59] time you forgive

[1:30:40] upon you and learn of
[1:30:42] me for I am meek and lowly in heart
[1:30:46] notice no self in that I am meek and
[1:30:51] lowly in heart
[1:30:54] yeah and you shall find rest unto your
[1:30:58] souls for my yoke is easy and my burden
[1:31:01] is l i g
[1:31:05] HT now they interpret as Li te you can
[1:31:08] say that both ways but in this case it's
[1:31:16] light all
[1:31:19] right because you're going to go through
[1:31:21] struggles and trials and it's not going
[1:31:23] to be easy
[1:31:24] you're bearing light and Satan hates the
[1:31:28] light all right so it's going to be
[1:31:31] you're going to carry a
[1:31:33] burden but you're
[1:31:35] yolked I want you to notice this and
[1:31:38] we'll come to a yoke a
[1:31:40] Yol is a chain a link a bond of
[1:31:43] connection as the Yoke of
[1:31:47] marriage the yoke is a couple a
[1:31:51] pair a couple a pair
[1:31:54] like two y oxen Yol together they work
[1:31:57] as
[1:31:59] one the bride and the bridegroom yolk
[1:32:01] together they work as
[1:32:04] one amen you're yolked with him take my
[1:32:08] yoke how I willing to say Lord give me
[1:32:10] the
[1:32:12] Yoke are you going to Bear persecution
[1:32:15] yes you can bear hard trials you're down
[1:32:17] in that you're down in that Valley see
[1:32:20] be
[1:32:22] misunderstood this when that you are is
[1:32:25] misunderstood this voice is
[1:32:29] misunderstood amen this this uh this
[1:32:34] wind moving through coming through led
[1:32:38] by the spirit is
[1:32:40] misunderstood human thinking would say
[1:32:42] oh it can't be that can't be him that
[1:32:44] can't be see okay a CH be careful what
[1:32:47] you say can't
[1:32:50] be amen all right now I now and a yoke
[1:32:55] to put a yoke on means to join in a
[1:32:59] yoke as to yoke oxen or a pair of
[1:33:03] oxen to couple a yoke means to couple to
[1:33:08] join with one another do you realize
[1:33:10] that every member of that body is joked
[1:33:13] with
[1:33:14] Christ they're one person every member
[1:33:17] is a member of that one head it's one
[1:33:21] person amen every member of body born of
[1:33:25] his Spirit can't be another person it is
[1:33:27] that
[1:33:29] person amen
[1:33:31] yolked now meekness meekness I love this
[1:33:35] meaning this is taken right directly out
[1:33:37] of the Greek meaning it said meekness
[1:33:39] toward God is that disposition of spirit
[1:33:42] in which we accept his dealings with us
[1:33:44] as good and therefore without disputing
[1:33:47] or resisting in the Old Testament the
[1:33:50] meek are those who relying holy relying
[1:33:53] on God rather than their own strength to
[1:33:56] defend them against Injustice thus
[1:33:59] meekness toward evil people means
[1:34:01] knowing that God is permitting the
[1:34:03] injuries they inflict that he is using
[1:34:05] them to purify his elect and that he
[1:34:07] will deliver his elect in his
[1:34:10] time amen gentleness or meekness is the
[1:34:15] opposite to self assertiveness and
[1:34:18] self-interest it stems from trust in
[1:34:21] God's goodness and control over the sit
[1:34:24] situation the gentle person is not
[1:34:26] occupied with self at
[1:34:28] all the meek are not occupied with self
[1:34:31] at
[1:34:32] all this is a work of the Holy Ghost not
[1:34:36] of the human
[1:34:39] will and the and the wind blowing where
[1:34:42] it listeth is his will it's his moving
[1:34:45] it's his doing he directs it he guides
[1:34:48] it and you're moving with it you're in
[1:34:51] it that's you being led being guided
[1:34:53] being
[1:34:56] directed amen and lowly means of low
[1:35:01] degree humble having a humble opinion of
[1:35:05] oneself crucifying
[1:35:09] self not self
[1:35:12] assertiveness amen not puffed up not
[1:35:15] pointing the people back at
[1:35:18] you amen but humble humble in mind
[1:35:22] humble in spirit humble having a humble
[1:35:24] opinions of
[1:35:27] oneself
[1:35:29] crucifying self that's what lonely means
[1:35:33] Jesus said if you'll follow me deny
[1:35:36] yourself take up your cross and follow
[1:35:38] me now brother sister I want to read
[1:35:41] something this is I'm
[1:35:44] closing I know I've said that but I am
[1:35:47] right now I want to read something taken
[1:35:49] out of the family altar book this is
[1:35:52] this is book if you have those books
[1:35:54] this is
[1:35:56] book this is book volume
[1:35:58] three he goes through the Psalms here
[1:36:02] but I want to take the quote and he took
[1:36:04] it out of Psalms 57 1-6 so he's quoting
[1:36:08] on that Psalm but let me read the quote
[1:36:11] you are Prophet speaking you are the
[1:36:13] light of the
[1:36:15] world a city that is set on a hill that
[1:36:19] cannot be hid
[1:36:23] and we tonight ought to be ashamed of
[1:36:26] ourselves and honestly and humbly
[1:36:28] confess our unbelief before God and ask
[1:36:31] him to forgive us of how we represent
[1:36:33] him in this life he's depending on us
[1:36:38] can you imagine that why would God
[1:36:40] depend on us you are his
[1:36:48] word Quicken you are the Quicken
[1:36:51] remember that one that's born to you is
[1:36:52] a new creature and it's the quickening
[1:36:55] spirit amen all right it's the Lord From
[1:37:00] Heaven all right the Old Testament
[1:37:02] people did not have this presence you're
[1:37:05] unaware you're unaware of that you refer
[1:37:09] back sometimes to Elijah to Moses let me
[1:37:11] read that again the Old Testament people
[1:37:13] did not have this
[1:37:17] presence you're unaware of that you
[1:37:20] refer back sometime to Elijah to Moses
[1:37:23] and those those people Moses and Elijah
[1:37:25] and those people were great men ordained
[1:37:27] of God but yet not the privilege that
[1:37:30] you
[1:37:31] have they haven't the privilege they did
[1:37:34] not have the power given them to perform
[1:37:37] as you have got yourself everything you
[1:37:40] have got yourself and what you have is
[1:37:43] everything that's in
[1:37:48] Christ for they foresaw this day
[1:37:52] embraced it and believed it and looked
[1:37:55] for it to come before it ever come now
[1:37:59] we're living right in it and afraid of
[1:38:02] it see what a privilege now if Satan's
[1:38:07] body can be operated by unbelief and
[1:38:10] doubts and fears will produce what the
[1:38:13] scripture says it will doubts and fears
[1:38:16] will produce what the scripture said it
[1:38:22] will amen that's quite a statement isn't
[1:38:24] it doubt what now he says let me I got
[1:38:27] to find back where I was
[1:38:29] here yeah doubt and will produce what
[1:38:32] the scripture says it will it'll produce
[1:38:34] sickness it'll produce disaster what
[1:38:37] will doubt and fears it'll produce all
[1:38:41] those things and then people by
[1:38:44] unbelieving produce that shouldn't
[1:38:46] people believing with the power of God
[1:38:49] harness them those things and bring them
[1:38:52] back to correction
[1:38:54] what did God redeem us for did you ever
[1:38:58] think what he redeemed us for why didn't
[1:39:01] he just make you the atonement and say
[1:39:04] now why didn't he just make you or bring
[1:39:06] to you other words make you the
[1:39:08] atonement and say now there's no need of
[1:39:10] giving them deep Powers there's no need
[1:39:13] in making this man a Son of God there's
[1:39:15] no need in doing that I will just I will
[1:39:18] just ask him to believe it write his
[1:39:20] name on The Book of Life and that
[1:39:22] settles it but he gave gave us these
[1:39:24] redeemed but he gave us don't miss that
[1:39:29] these redeemed blessings that we might
[1:39:31] operate the work of God by the energy of
[1:39:34] the holy
[1:39:38] spirit in St John 15 he said now that's
[1:39:41] the reason I read that about being
[1:39:43] yolked he said St John 15 said I am the
[1:39:47] vine you are the branches do you know
[1:39:50] that the vine can't bear fruit
[1:39:54] I'm going to let that soak a
[1:39:56] minute the vine can't bear
[1:40:00] fruit watch what he said although the
[1:40:04] fruit is in the
[1:40:09] vine but the fruit cannot be brought
[1:40:12] forth from a Vine it has to have the
[1:40:15] branch to Bear the
[1:40:19] fruit what's the complete Revelation
[1:40:22] then who's bringing forth the fruit it's
[1:40:24] the vine the fruits in the vine the
[1:40:26] energy is there but where is it going to
[1:40:28] be transferred to to the
[1:40:33] branch and what are they going to
[1:40:35] produce the genuine revelation of Jesus
[1:40:38] Christ for this day and season not the
[1:40:41] it's come out of the shook what are they
[1:40:43] going to produce Christ in Bride
[1:40:49] form he said it's got to have a branch
[1:40:52] to produce the fruit and you are the
[1:40:54] branches now the Vine with all of its
[1:40:57] energy cannot produce anything unless
[1:41:00] the branch is willing to receive the
[1:41:04] energy
[1:41:07] am now God is depending on you as a
[1:41:11] member of his body to Bear the fruit of
[1:41:14] his spirit and now if he's depending on
[1:41:17] you let's open up our
[1:41:21] channels and let the Holy Spirit come in
[1:41:24] tonight and energize us and free us from
[1:41:28] all these fears and
[1:41:31] doubts may God grant it let's Stand
