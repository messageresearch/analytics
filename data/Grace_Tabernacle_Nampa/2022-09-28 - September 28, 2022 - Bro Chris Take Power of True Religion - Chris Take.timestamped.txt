[34:26] we'll pray but
[34:28] sorry talk louder
[34:30] foreign
[34:31] we uh I was told you to talk a little
[34:34] bit louder when I first start because
[34:35] then I started preaching and it blows
[34:37] the speakers out so
[34:39] um
[34:40] but uh
[34:41] tonight's Wednesday night and um
[34:44] sometimes we come we come on Wednesday
[34:47] night and uh even myself
[34:49] we come with our expectations a little
[34:51] bit too small
[34:53] and uh that's to be expected you spent
[34:56] all day thinking about the world and
[34:58] dealing with the Mammon and the money
[35:00] and all of that stuff and now
[35:02] to come tonight so I just want to
[35:05] challenge you or read the scripture and
[35:06] we'll pray but challenge you to really
[35:07] ask yourself why you are here tonight
[35:10] we know the obvious reason you have a
[35:12] desire to grow closer to God but why are
[35:14] you here tonight
[35:15] John chapter 8. now we might come back
[35:18] to John 8 I'm not entirely sure I'd read
[35:20] the whole chapter if I could but um you
[35:23] go home and you read it we're going to
[35:25] pick it apart tonight uh John chapter 8
[35:28] verse one Jesus went unto the Mount of
[35:31] Olives and early in the morning he came
[35:32] again into the temple and all the people
[35:35] came unto him and he sat down and taught
[35:38] them
[35:39] and the scribes and Pharisees brought
[35:40] unto him a woman taken in adultery and
[35:43] when they had set her in the midst they
[35:45] say unto him Master this woman was taken
[35:47] in adultery in the very act now Moses
[35:50] and the law commanded us that we should
[35:51] be stoned but what sayeth thou this they
[35:54] said tempting him that they might have
[35:56] to accuse him Jesus stooped down and
[35:59] with his finger wrote on the ground as
[36:02] though he heard them not I'm sure that
[36:04] just frosted their cake
[36:07] they were expecting an argument
[36:10] and when someone comes and they expect
[36:12] an argument and you give them them it
[36:14] kind of deflates them
[36:15] so when they continued asking him he
[36:17] lifted up himself and said unto them he
[36:20] that is without sin among you let him
[36:23] first cast a stone at her
[36:25] and again he stooped down and wrote on
[36:28] the ground and they which heard it being
[36:30] convicted by their own conscience went
[36:32] out one by one beginning at the eldest
[36:34] even unto the last and Jesus was left
[36:37] alone
[36:38] and the woman standing in the midst
[36:40] when Jesus had lifted up himself and saw
[36:43] none but the woman he said unto her
[36:45] woman where are those thine accusers
[36:47] hath no man condemned him and she said
[36:50] no man Lord and Jesus said unto her
[36:52] neither do I condemn thee go and sin no
[36:55] more
[36:56] that's powerheads
[36:58] Heavenly Father Lord Jesus we have a
[37:00] desire tonight
[37:02] to hear from Heaven Lord to hear from
[37:04] from you father
[37:06] nobody wants to hear from Chris tonight
[37:09] we want to hear from you I want to hear
[37:12] from you Lord so I pray you'd harness
[37:14] this flesh Lord harness this vessel to
[37:17] do your will father to do your bidding
[37:19] and may you speak to our hearts tonight
[37:21] though we lay ourselves at your feet we
[37:23] surrender to you Lord and we ask that
[37:25] you would come Lord many times on a
[37:27] Wednesday nights Lord we're tired but
[37:29] God I pray Lord that you would bring a
[37:31] special anointing Lord that upon your
[37:34] people Lord Jesus and that you would
[37:36] speak to their hearts Lord Jesus whether
[37:38] there's an outward expression I don't
[37:40] really care Lord but I won't and that
[37:43] inward expression Lord that abundance of
[37:46] life to swell within their hearts Lord
[37:48] Jesus father we need the strength we
[37:50] need to be fed tonight Lord we're coming
[37:53] to you and asking in your great Mercy
[37:55] father would you be gracious and speak
[37:57] to our hearts tonight we pray we love
[37:59] you Lord we thank you in Jesus name
[38:01] amen amen you may be seated tonight
[38:07] Maya my uh title tonight is
[38:10] of True Religion
[38:13] power of True Religion
[38:16] and we stopped in verse 11 here and
[38:18] we're going to go on to 12 and then
[38:20] spake Jesus again unto them saying I am
[38:23] the light of the world he that followeth
[38:25] me shall not walk in darkness but shall
[38:28] have the light of life
[38:31] now I've been I've been uh
[38:36] pondering a couple of different things
[38:38] lately
[38:40] and one of them is is
[38:42] religious spirits
[38:45] the other one is the power that Satan
[38:48] can hold over somebody
[38:50] when they have something in their life
[38:52] that's not taken care of that's
[38:56] right I wrestle between many different
[38:57] titles and this sermon it actually
[38:59] brought I just kind of keep a track as I
[39:02] go through life of sermon titles and
[39:05] notes to go with them and and I don't
[39:06] know if they'll ever turn to sermons or
[39:08] what will happen but this is a a
[39:10] bringing together of several different
[39:12] little one-liners that I put down
[39:15] and the one that was really on my heart
[39:17] and and just really stirs my soul
[39:21] is the thought of burning
[39:23] burning the devil's blackmail
[39:26] now when someone has blackmail over you
[39:29] that means that you've done something
[39:31] wrong that no one else knows about but
[39:33] you and that individual and they say you
[39:36] need to do this or I'll tell everybody
[39:38] what you did
[39:40] now when you have something in your life
[39:42] that you're keeping a secret that you're
[39:44] holding on that you're afraid to let go
[39:46] of afraid to surrender the devil can
[39:49] come along and say
[39:51] and hold that power over you
[39:53] but when you finally take care of that
[39:56] thing when you finally make that thing
[39:58] right or you repent or you finally go
[39:59] before God and and lay in full surrender
[40:02] you can take that piece of blackmail and
[40:05] set it in the fire
[40:07] the devil will come along and try to
[40:08] remind you of that thing again and say
[40:10] but I have the I you this you did this
[40:13] and but now he holds no more power over
[40:16] you
[40:17] because you've burned the devil's
[40:18] blackmail
[40:19] there's a couple of scriptures here in
[40:21] John chapter eight it's set at 8 32. ye
[40:25] shall know the truth and the truth shall
[40:27] make you free
[40:28] John 8 34 Jesus answered them verily
[40:31] verily I say unto you whosoever
[40:32] committed sin is the servant of sin
[40:35] so thinking on these things and then
[40:37] trying to find the Lord's Direction I
[40:39] just I've been drawn to this chapter in
[40:42] John for for quite a few days now just
[40:45] pondering and
[40:46] and uh a week or more and reading it
[40:49] over and over and over again it's it's a
[40:51] long chapter it's about 59 verses and if
[40:53] you're like me I needed some time to
[40:55] digest what I've read and and
[40:57] um if you're like me I I sometimes skim
[41:00] um I guess that's they call it the
[41:02] millennial skim but um I miss things all
[41:05] the time because I don't actually read
[41:06] it
[41:07] so sometimes you get in a chapter and
[41:09] you're in the morning and devotions and
[41:10] you begin to skim so you have to back up
[41:12] and start over again and I'll be honest
[41:15] with you tonight I don't exactly know
[41:16] everything that the Lord wants to pull
[41:18] from this chapter but I'm going to just
[41:21] lean into his will
[41:23] so if you if you start at the beginning
[41:25] of the chapter Jesus is preaching to a
[41:27] group of people he's on the Mount of
[41:30] Olives and and he's and he sat down and
[41:33] he's teaching them and in the middle of
[41:35] service the Pharisees and um the scribes
[41:40] bring they bust in the door and bring
[41:42] this woman they found committing
[41:44] adultery
[41:47] um this was all a setup
[41:52] no doubt they probably knew already knew
[41:55] this woman and her habits
[41:58] but they set it up to catch him in the
[42:00] to catch Jesus in this moment so they
[42:03] they interrupt the service and they they
[42:06] bring this woman and um
[42:09] in their righteous
[42:13] their arrogancy
[42:17] they had a religious spirit they bring
[42:19] her what say you let me tell you
[42:21] something Sin is Sin
[42:26] their iniquity
[42:28] their ability to see truth was just as
[42:31] much sin as that woman in adultery their
[42:33] sin was the spiritual fornication
[42:37] and yet they bring her in in in their
[42:40] arrogancy and they throw her down before
[42:43] him
[42:44] and uh the Lord in his perfect will and
[42:47] sovereignty just gives them a chance to
[42:50] fume
[42:52] and he says you without sin cast the
[42:56] first stone the Bible says the eldest to
[42:58] the youngest because the older you get
[43:00] hopefully the wiser you get
[43:03] and they realize
[43:05] they have no place to stand on now it
[43:08] seems a bit interesting a bit weird for
[43:10] me to take that and use that as as the
[43:14] power the devil has over you in this
[43:15] context but if you look at it if these
[43:18] men were not living in the position they
[43:20] were living in
[43:22] now bear with me they could have thrown
[43:24] the stone
[43:27] but if they had been living in the
[43:28] position they would have they should
[43:30] have been living and they would have
[43:31] never drugged her to the feet of Jesus
[43:35] but the Lord knew the sin in their life
[43:38] the Lord knew the position that they had
[43:40] that they were arrogant in their
[43:41] self-righteousness in their religious
[43:44] spirit
[43:45] turns me to Romans chapter 13.
[43:52] Romans 13.
[43:58] verse 11.
[44:02] thank you
[44:04] and that knowing the time that now it is
[44:07] high time to awake out of sleep for now
[44:09] is our Salvation nearer than when we
[44:12] believed the night is far spent the day
[44:15] is at hand let us therefore cast off the
[44:17] works of darkness and let us put on the
[44:19] armor of light let us walk honestly as
[44:22] in the day not in rioting and
[44:25] drunkenness not in chambering and
[44:27] wantingness not in strife and in being
[44:29] but put you on the Lord Jesus Christ and
[44:32] make not Provisions for the flesh to
[44:34] fulfill the lust thereof
[44:36] verse 11 again and that knowing the time
[44:38] that now it is high time to awake
[44:41] out of sleep for now as our Salvation
[44:44] nearer than when we believed
[44:47] awake light
[44:52] you hide from the light if you're hiding
[44:54] something in your life
[44:58] and and if in whatever that thing may be
[45:01] unchecked
[45:04] can produce a bit of a religious spirit
[45:07] amen
[45:08] if you've buried it underneath reasoning
[45:12] brother Branham
[45:13] I have the I gave them the whole quote
[45:15] it's just it's really long but it's a
[45:18] story he's talking about when he's over
[45:20] in India and this blind man comes to him
[45:23] and he was given a vision that the blind
[45:25] man would stand before him and that his
[45:27] eyes would be open so God has given him
[45:30] Authority based upon the word and he can
[45:33] act upon that faith
[45:36] and so he begins to challenge the these
[45:39] uh muhammadans and sheikhs and jains
[45:42] and all of all of them he says I
[45:45] challenge you in the name of the Lord
[45:46] Jesus Christ to come give the man his
[45:48] sight if your religion's so great
[45:55] surely if there's somebody got to be
[45:57] right somebody's got to be wrong
[46:00] that's right don't never be afraid to
[46:02] put Christianity to a showdown
[46:04] God's real or he isn't God
[46:07] there's only one true religion
[46:10] and that's Christianity now you can't
[46:12] play it you've got to know what you're
[46:14] speaking of and you've got to know that
[46:16] God has told you to do it or it'll never
[46:20] work what's the one of the big does the
[46:23] the big divide between
[46:26] True Religion and false religion is the
[46:30] power of Christ
[46:32] one does not contain the power of Christ
[46:34] because it is the it is Antichrist
[46:37] religious spirit is Antichrist
[46:40] so he says you cannot you can't play
[46:42] with it and you've got to know what
[46:43] you're speaking of you got to know that
[46:45] God has told you to do it or it'll never
[46:48] work
[46:49] I wouldn't have said that for nothing if
[46:52] I hadn't have seen the vision that he
[46:54] was going to happen
[46:56] just like I imagine Elijah on Mount
[46:58] Carmel
[47:00] um he said so I'd seen there was a there
[47:03] was this man that was going to receive
[47:04] his side that said what would you do he
[47:07] said that he would serve the god that
[47:09] gives him back his sight so he asked the
[47:11] man
[47:12] what will he do and he said I'll serve
[47:13] the God who gives me back my sight so he
[47:16] puts the challenge and he says he said
[47:18] you muhammadans would tell him he was
[47:20] wrong and you Buddhas would tell them
[47:22] the holidays was wrong what would you do
[47:24] you'd only change his way of thinking
[47:26] thinking it's all intellectual no power
[47:30] no sight but no one they would not stop
[47:32] to say hey the man's still blind
[47:37] um it is not a coincidence that in this
[47:40] moment God used a blind man to show his
[47:43] power because what has God what was
[47:45] God's word underneath that that
[47:48] messenger coming to do bring
[47:50] sight to the religious blinding of the
[47:52] the eyes that were blinded spiritually
[47:56] so he challenged them and he says you
[47:58] know we got the same thing in America
[47:59] Baptist wants to make all the methodists
[48:01] Baptist and the Methodist wants to make
[48:03] all the Pentecostals methodists and
[48:05] Pentecostals wants to make them all
[48:06] Pentecostal
[48:07] it's just a change a way of thinking all
[48:11] psychology he said but we have one God
[48:13] we worship
[48:14] just different methods of worshiping I
[48:16] said but truly the real true Jehovah God
[48:18] who made the man
[48:21] and I say he was wrong he was a sun
[48:23] worshiper he worshiped the creation
[48:24] instead of the Creator that's true back
[48:27] to the real Creator let the real Creator
[48:29] give him back his sight so he can be of
[48:31] a benefit to him
[48:32] he said I challenge you all to come to
[48:35] the platform and give him his sight
[48:37] he says it was quieter than it isn't
[48:40] here now over 500 000 people you never
[48:43] heard they would just piled on each
[48:45] other as far as you could see one great
[48:47] dark mass of people I said why are you
[48:49] so quiet
[48:50] this afternoon he was telling how little
[48:53] Christianity was how powerless it was
[48:55] and how it was all broke up in different
[48:57] organizations I said now come let's see
[48:59] what your religion can do for him nobody
[49:01] said a word
[49:03] I said of course you don't because you
[49:05] can't
[49:06] now I mean human Muhammad didn't see
[49:08] there's all the muhammadan priests and
[49:09] all everybody's quiet
[49:11] the floor is open he says I'll believe
[49:14] on the god that you serve
[49:17] I say because you can't do it and
[49:19] neither can I
[49:21] but the god of Heaven who raised up his
[49:23] son Jesus Christ has sent his spirit and
[49:25] his spirit's working through his church
[49:27] he was in a position of power and
[49:29] authority
[49:31] because he was in the position of Christ
[49:35] there was nothing standing between him
[49:37] to come boldly
[49:39] with the word God had given him and
[49:42] stand and speak
[49:48] so therefore I would be the same but the
[49:51] Lord has showed me showed a vision that
[49:52] he's going to receive his sight now let
[49:54] the god that really is God speak they
[49:57] brought the man up close they don't
[49:58] interpret the prayer I said Lord God
[49:59] you're just as much God today as you
[50:01] ever was we could take lessons from the
[50:04] prayers that brother Branham spoke when
[50:05] he prayed for people in need this is
[50:08] what all he said Lord God you're just as
[50:09] much a God today as you ever was and you
[50:11] showed this Vision that the man would
[50:13] receive his sight now let the man
[50:15] receive his sight in the name of the
[50:17] Lord Jesus no more than said that and he
[50:19] let out a scream and grab me run up the
[50:22] mayor of the city was sitting there he
[50:23] grabbed him people began screaming that
[50:26] was the last meeting I could have in
[50:27] India
[50:28] they barely pulled him out of the out of
[50:30] the meeting he says what is it the same
[50:33] God that's and I love this line here the
[50:35] same God that always was always will be
[50:38] he's the same yesterday today and
[50:40] forever don't be afraid of Christianity
[50:42] But be sure you know what you're
[50:45] speaking of be sure that God has showed
[50:48] you and definitely told you if he tells
[50:50] you to do a thing don't you be afraid
[50:52] you go do it because God said to do it
[50:56] so that was a that was God the power of
[51:00] True Religion on display
[51:03] what is a religious spirit in Israel in
[51:05] the church number one 1953 but it says
[51:07] no the Antichrist spirit is so close
[51:09] like the real thing tell them to deceive
[51:11] the very elect if possible Jesus said so
[51:13] Matthew 24 it's a religious spirit oh
[51:16] why Cain and Abel were brothers
[51:20] The Crow and the dove sat on the same
[51:21] Roost Esau and Jacob Judah and Jesus
[51:24] preacher and Treasurer see they're
[51:26] always just the deceiving the lie that
[51:29] Satan told Eve was 90 truth
[51:33] 90 truth and the lie that you can tell
[51:36] how I've heard men bypass pieces in the
[51:39] scripture just to keep
[51:42] from it hurts their theology see but if
[51:44] that this part's right that part's right
[51:47] let's put it together and make it fit
[51:50] through the whole Bible
[51:53] invasion of the United States 1954 don't
[51:55] you see how religious the devil is
[51:58] the devil is not
[52:00] no anti-great big thing like communism
[52:02] all against Christianity that's not that
[52:05] oh well of the devil sure but it's not
[52:07] the Antichrist the Antichrist is very
[52:10] religious very religious it was a
[52:12] religious spirit that crucified Jesus
[52:15] it's always been a religious World a
[52:18] religious people that crucifies it's the
[52:20] religious people that was against the
[52:22] true Christ it was the religious
[52:25] prophets that was against my kids the
[52:26] religious people of the day that's
[52:28] against the message of God
[52:33] is this an is this Baptist is this
[52:35] Pentecostals no it's the message
[52:41] that religious spirit hides within the
[52:44] shadows of almost truth
[52:48] the devil loves Darkness he loves
[52:50] Shadows you can take Shadows
[52:53] and make things and and make things
[52:56] appear to be different than they are and
[52:57] and you can sneak through Darkness
[52:59] easier than you can in the light but
[53:01] when you turn the light on
[53:04] there's nothing to be afraid of
[53:08] it sometimes there's things and we have
[53:10] we have questions and secrets that maybe
[53:13] aren't even sin but doubts amen but what
[53:17] is sin but unbelief
[53:19] we have doubts
[53:21] doubt that in the secret
[53:22] most truth we have p
[53:27] truth
[53:28] come to church here
[53:31] they come to church over other places
[53:34] around the world that are message
[53:35] churches
[53:37] you can go through a season of being
[53:40] anointed by a religious spirit God can
[53:44] bring you out because God's Mercy is
[53:46] great and God's Mercy is new every day
[53:49] he'll do whatever it takes to get his
[53:51] son or daughter back to him but you see
[53:53] what happened is we get in a position
[53:55] and we find ourselves living in almost
[53:58] truth
[54:01] in Acts chapter 19 we found another
[54:04] display of this religious spirit
[54:08] Acts 19 verse 11. you can turn if you
[54:11] want I'm gonna go right to it and read
[54:13] it and God wrought special Miracles by
[54:15] the hands of Paul so that from his body
[54:17] were brought into the sick handkerchiefs
[54:19] or aprons and the diseases departed from
[54:21] them and evil spirits went out of them
[54:25] foreign
[54:27] the insertion of the Vagabond Jews
[54:29] Exorcist took upon them to call over
[54:31] them which had evil spirits the name of
[54:34] the Lord Jesus saying We Adore You by
[54:36] Jesus whom Paul preaches now Exorcist as
[54:38] Jews were these holy men that had the
[54:41] way with the incense and different
[54:43] things and they and they they would ex
[54:45] they would exercise the demons
[54:48] or they thought
[54:50] and so these were were what considered
[54:52] you know holy men
[54:55] they weren't they were they had a spirit
[54:57] of Witchcraft on them but they were
[55:00] accepted into the church and so they're
[55:02] like they see this and they're like oh
[55:03] this is exactly what we do we're going
[55:05] to do the same thing but but look we
[55:07] need to take the words and we need to
[55:09] say the words differently
[55:11] so they they they they they they took
[55:13] upon them to call over them which had
[55:15] evil spirits the name of the Lord Jesus
[55:17] saying we endure You by Jesus whom Paul
[55:19] preacheth so they saw power in the
[55:22] spoken word
[55:25] but you see it's not just the words
[55:28] right that's right it's not the the you
[55:31] know the classic example which we don't
[55:32] have today so I'll bring it current when
[55:34] the cop pulls you over and he walks up
[55:36] and he says I need you to step out of
[55:38] the car
[55:39] nobody has a right to tell you that
[55:40] except for him
[55:42] in the old Joker walks up you say
[55:45] adios and you're just gonna drive off
[55:46] right you're not gonna let just anybody
[55:48] pull you over but it's the authority
[55:50] that he has behind him so you listen to
[55:53] him I hope anyways
[55:54] and um
[55:56] the ones that don't know they don't
[55:58] never get away anyways
[56:00] so
[56:05] as as as
[56:07] no matter how it sounds I would I would
[56:10] have conversations with people
[56:13] of a certain group
[56:15] and they all had this same
[56:18] sound
[56:19] now it wasn't the way they they wasn't
[56:21] their voice it wasn't how they formed
[56:23] words it wasn't necessarily what they
[56:25] said or though it was but it was just
[56:28] something about the anointing on their
[56:30] words and I would I would I would pray
[56:33] and I would Ponder
[56:35] and and I I just I I was just what is
[56:38] that thing I did I wanted to I wanted I
[56:41] wanted a label for it I wanted to
[56:43] identify it
[56:46] and so I was in conversation with them
[56:49] recently sitting at the at a table and
[56:53] all of a sudden the Lord spoke to my
[56:55] heart and said there's no power in their
[56:58] lives
[57:00] they can talk like the message but
[57:03] there's no power in their lives they
[57:05] don't look right
[57:07] they dress Holiness but they don't look
[57:09] right amen you know what that is that's
[57:11] the spirit of Christ on you and me
[57:14] identifying the spirit of the Antichrist
[57:17] on them our they Antichrist no
[57:21] they're underneath an anointing and God
[57:23] can deliver them from that anointing
[57:26] if he sees fit
[57:28] so they're saying the same thing they're
[57:30] going and they're doing this stuff and
[57:31] they and they present it in such a way
[57:34] and to me it it to me
[57:37] and this just sounds a bit awful but
[57:40] it's dripping with
[57:42] with it's oozing with overs over
[57:46] sympathy you ever meet somebody who's
[57:48] just pity it's dripping with pity
[57:50] they try to be to to perceive themselves
[57:53] as humble but it's arrogancy
[57:56] in a different way
[57:59] and it disgusted my spirit
[58:02] I it just made me feel gross and then
[58:05] you'd meet somebody and they're genuine
[58:07] and you just you're lifted up just by
[58:09] being in the same room as them
[58:11] and what it is it's a spirit
[58:14] I don't know how true it is or how
[58:16] accurate is but there was a woman one
[58:18] time who said she saw she saw demons and
[58:20] she saw the demon that was the religious
[58:22] spirit and she drew it and it was this
[58:24] this weird looking creature with like a
[58:27] tie and a stack of books
[58:29] that's the religious spirit she saw I
[58:31] don't know if that's true but I'm gonna
[58:32] use that as an example fictional example
[58:35] that it's just a man with a tie walking
[58:38] around with a stack of books
[58:40] parroting words but no power amen
[58:44] parroting words but no power and if
[58:47] you're not careful you're not careful
[58:51] you'll struggle with that because the
[58:54] words will be the right words
[58:57] and they'll say it in such a way you
[59:00] know you know the serpent was he
[59:02] beguiled Eve he seduced her smooth
[59:06] not he wasn't this demonic looking man
[59:10] she would have ran screaming he was
[59:12] smooth
[59:15] they're smooth and they got money to
[59:17] back it up
[59:19] and that's the problem
[59:23] but
[59:24] God has given us the eagle anointing
[59:28] eyes to see into the spirit Realm
[59:33] let me tell you something that an
[59:34] important lesson I learned though I be
[59:36] young
[59:40] things would happen I would meet
[59:42] somebody and I would have this very bad
[59:45] feeling good people good Christian
[59:48] people this very bad feeling in my
[59:50] spirit and I would feel bad
[59:55] but I can't recount all of them to you
[59:57] except for the one right now but time
[59:59] after time again something came up from
[1:00:02] the past
[1:00:03] that revealed a spirit
[1:00:07] that revealed somebody who didn't
[1:00:08] believe it someone was what was had a
[1:00:10] homosexual Spirit or different things
[1:00:12] like that
[1:00:14] and I started to pay attention to that
[1:00:16] and I'm gonna tell you tonight even you
[1:00:18] young people pay attention to that when
[1:00:20] you meet a man or you meet a woman and
[1:00:21] something doesn't sit right
[1:00:24] don't be stupid
[1:00:26] something doesn't say right do not go
[1:00:27] along with them do not even do not even
[1:00:30] come around this side of the church
[1:00:31] alone with them
[1:00:32] stay with other believers stay with
[1:00:34] other people if there's a something in
[1:00:36] your heart that touches you that that's
[1:00:38] the that's the Holy Spirit warning you
[1:00:40] don't ignore it
[1:00:43] amen praise the Lord that one was free
[1:00:45] like they say
[1:00:47] um and there were seven sons of one Siva
[1:00:50] a Jew
[1:00:51] and the chief of the priest which did so
[1:00:53] so they say we adore you by Jesus whom
[1:00:55] Paul preached that they even had the
[1:00:57] warrable in their voice
[1:00:59] and the evil spirit answered and said
[1:01:01] Jesus I know and Paul I know but who are
[1:01:04] you let me ask you tonight is your name
[1:01:07] on The Devil's registry
[1:01:10] you want your name on The Devil's
[1:01:12] registry you want him to know who you
[1:01:15] are
[1:01:16] but if there's blackmail he's God over
[1:01:19] you
[1:01:20] he's going to do what we're going to
[1:01:21] read here and the man in whom the evil
[1:01:23] spirit was leaped on them and overcame
[1:01:25] them and prevailed against them so that
[1:01:27] they fled out of the house naked and
[1:01:29] wounded and this was known to all the
[1:01:32] Jews and Greeks also dwelling at Ephesus
[1:01:34] and fear fell on all on them all and the
[1:01:37] name of the Lord Jesus was magnified
[1:01:40] and many that believed came and
[1:01:42] confessed and showed their deeds
[1:01:46] amen God has a way of putting fear in
[1:01:49] your heart good Godly fear that will
[1:01:52] bring it to a place where you say I
[1:01:54] don't even care
[1:01:55] I'm gonna repent of this thing amen amen
[1:01:57] because I'm tired of the devil having
[1:01:59] power over me
[1:02:01] many of them also which used curious
[1:02:03] Arts so in other words I think they're
[1:02:05] an Ephesus if I read this correctly
[1:02:07] Ephesus was a city a place where people
[1:02:10] were into the the spiritual and the
[1:02:13] Magical and all this stuff
[1:02:15] and they bring their Curious Arch
[1:02:17] witchcraft black magic all of that stuff
[1:02:19] it's it's real
[1:02:21] brought their books together and burned
[1:02:23] them before all men and they counted the
[1:02:26] price of them and found it 50 000 pieces
[1:02:28] of silver
[1:02:30] fifty thousand pieces of silver
[1:02:33] I don't know why they equates the
[1:02:34] dollars but I think it's more than fifty
[1:02:36] thousand dollars
[1:02:38] a couple of hundred thousand dollars in
[1:02:40] books these people had invested their
[1:02:42] money in instead of selling them to get
[1:02:44] the money back to give it to the church
[1:02:46] praise God they burned that trash
[1:02:49] outside
[1:02:51] I'm sure that caused quite a stir so
[1:02:54] myly grew the word of God
[1:02:57] and there's an in there so mildly grew
[1:02:59] the word of God and prevailed
[1:03:02] and prevailed
[1:03:04] the word of God prevails against all
[1:03:08] things the word of God prevails against
[1:03:11] the fear that the devil tries to hold
[1:03:13] over you
[1:03:14] you know you can be delivered and the
[1:03:16] devil will get you in a place of
[1:03:18] condemnation and fear and steal your
[1:03:20] victory
[1:03:23] always talks about that that Crow
[1:03:25] wherever had the thing tied to his leg
[1:03:26] and then he was set free and he refused
[1:03:28] to fly off
[1:03:32] remember
[1:03:33] him he who the son has set free amen is
[1:03:37] free indeed the word indeed is used that
[1:03:40] means no matter what you think or the
[1:03:43] devil tells you you are free indeed amen
[1:03:45] yes indeed
[1:03:47] you are free and and the Book of Esther
[1:03:50] chapter 2 verse 10. Esther had not
[1:03:53] showed her people nor her Kindred for
[1:03:56] Mordecai had charged her that she should
[1:03:58] not show it she had kept this secret
[1:04:00] that she was a Jew this is an
[1:04:03] interesting situation here because
[1:04:04] Esther was living a holy and a Pure Life
[1:04:08] but she had a secret
[1:04:11] I often wonder if the if the king knew
[1:04:15] who she was would he have signed the
[1:04:17] papers that Haman presented him
[1:04:20] probably not because Haman said these
[1:04:22] people the Jews
[1:04:25] so Esther keeps who she is a secret from
[1:04:28] the the king and um
[1:04:31] I am not reprimanding Esther
[1:04:35] her situation I just want to show you
[1:04:38] what happens when you reveal everything
[1:04:41] to the king you surrender all even your
[1:04:45] doubts even your questions you surrender
[1:04:48] it all to him Easter's Esther's Secret
[1:04:51] perhaps wasn't totally wrong
[1:04:55] but look at the freedom that happened
[1:04:57] when she revealed to the king everything
[1:05:00] about her so the king and Haman came
[1:05:03] this Esther chapter seven and to the
[1:05:05] banquet with Esther the queen and the
[1:05:06] King said again unto Esther it took her
[1:05:09] some time to work up the courage only
[1:05:11] again she has them to a banquet of wine
[1:05:13] what is thy petition Queen Esther and it
[1:05:15] shall be granted thee and what is thy
[1:05:17] request and it shall be performed even
[1:05:19] to the half of the Kingdom she was
[1:05:21] afraid
[1:05:22] she had fear but she still knew her
[1:05:25] position
[1:05:28] so she comes then Esther the queen
[1:05:31] answered and said I have found favor in
[1:05:32] thyro King if I have found favor in
[1:05:34] thyroid King and if it please the king
[1:05:37] let my life be given at my petition and
[1:05:39] my people at my request
[1:05:42] without the king probably has this
[1:05:43] puzzle look on his face like what in the
[1:05:45] world for we are sold I and my people to
[1:05:48] be destroyed to be slain and to perish
[1:05:50] but if we had been sold for Bond men and
[1:05:53] bond women I had held my tongue although
[1:05:55] the enemy could not countervale the
[1:05:57] king's damage then the King has you wear
[1:06:00] his answer to unto Esther the queen who
[1:06:02] is he and where is he that there's
[1:06:04] presume in his heart to do so who is it
[1:06:07] tell me Queen who is this person
[1:06:10] and the Esther said the adversary and
[1:06:13] the enemy is this wicked Haman
[1:06:16] the king's right-hand man
[1:06:18] the men he spent every day with pretty
[1:06:20] much
[1:06:21] got all his counsel from pretty much
[1:06:25] you don't think Esther in her position
[1:06:26] was afraid to say it's your right hand
[1:06:29] man king now that no we've laid this out
[1:06:32] many times and if you've been going to
[1:06:34] church for long enough to understand the
[1:06:35] position Esther was in as the queen she
[1:06:38] was the queen but even there was the
[1:06:41] right hand man
[1:06:44] she had to approach the queen a certain
[1:06:46] way but the right-hand man was part of
[1:06:48] the king's daily duties and had the
[1:06:51] king's ear
[1:06:52] and so she says it's your right hand man
[1:06:55] and the king gets up and he's just
[1:06:58] guess what he never doubted her
[1:07:01] he believed her
[1:07:04] he walks out into the garden the Bible
[1:07:06] says he walks out but then Bob says they
[1:07:08] said we'll keep reading so he walks out
[1:07:10] and from the banquet of Juan and in his
[1:07:13] wrath went into the palace garden and
[1:07:15] Haman set up to make a request for his
[1:07:16] life to after the queen he begins to beg
[1:07:19] and and he for he saw that there was
[1:07:21] evil determined against him by the king
[1:07:22] then the king returned out of the palace
[1:07:25] Garden into the place of the banquet of
[1:07:27] wine I I love the scripture and Haman
[1:07:30] was falling upon the bed where on Esther
[1:07:32] was
[1:07:33] that's in the king will he Force the
[1:07:35] queen also in my presence
[1:07:38] this man was fighting for his wife
[1:07:43] and said the king
[1:07:45] uh will he Force the queen also before
[1:07:47] me in the house as the word went out of
[1:07:49] the king's mouth they covered haman's
[1:07:51] face
[1:07:52] they grabbed him the guards grabbed
[1:07:54] Haman and harbinaw wanted the
[1:07:56] Chamberlain said before the king behold
[1:07:58] also The Gallows 50 cubits High which
[1:07:59] Haven had made for Mordecai who had
[1:08:01] spoken good for the king standeth in the
[1:08:03] house of Haman then the king said hang
[1:08:04] him thereon
[1:08:06] Now esther finds Liberty by revealing
[1:08:10] everything about her to the king
[1:08:14] see her secret of being a Jew
[1:08:16] necessarily wasn't a bad secret but the
[1:08:18] king didn't know everything about her
[1:08:22] God wants to know everything about you
[1:08:25] he said well he's all-knowing up he
[1:08:27] wants to hear you tell him
[1:08:30] everything about you
[1:08:33] Haman has your number until you do so
[1:08:40] um
[1:08:42] in the back I I actually read into the
[1:08:45] next chapter
[1:08:46] and I I found something I hadn't seen
[1:08:48] before maybe I'm the only one tonight
[1:08:52] on that day King has words gave the
[1:08:54] house
[1:08:55] of Haman the Jews enemy unto Esther okay
[1:08:58] so he gives
[1:09:00] unto Esther for Esther had told what he
[1:09:02] was unto her and the King took off his
[1:09:04] ring which he had taken from Haman and
[1:09:06] gave it unto Mordecai and Esther set
[1:09:08] Mordecai over the house of Haman and
[1:09:09] Esther spake okay now listen Esther
[1:09:12] spake yet again before the king and fell
[1:09:14] down at his feet and besought him with
[1:09:16] tears to put away the mischiefs of Haman
[1:09:18] the agagite and his device that he had
[1:09:20] devised against the Jews then the king
[1:09:22] held out the golden scepter before
[1:09:24] Esther
[1:09:25] so what Esther did the first time in
[1:09:27] coming to the queen and risking her life
[1:09:29] she did a second time
[1:09:30] you see what happened
[1:09:32] confidence in the king amen
[1:09:35] she both she bore everything to him
[1:09:37] every last secret of her heart and he
[1:09:40] accepted her
[1:09:42] right he didn't say what you're a Jew
[1:09:44] get out of my presence he accepted her
[1:09:47] no matter what secret you hold in your
[1:09:49] heart God will accept it God will accept
[1:09:53] you he'll do whatever it takes and he'll
[1:09:55] accept that and so the king in accepting
[1:09:58] that guess what he became identified
[1:10:01] with the Enemy he became identified with
[1:10:05] his when Christ came down and accepted a
[1:10:08] mortal body
[1:10:09] he became identified with Fallen
[1:10:12] Humanity but he did that so that you
[1:10:15] could become identified with him now
[1:10:18] everything the queen had in her heart
[1:10:20] the king knows there is no secrets there
[1:10:23] is nothing that Esther has to be afraid
[1:10:25] of now she has full and total confidence
[1:10:27] so without she bypasses all the
[1:10:29] legalities it just walks again into his
[1:10:31] presence and he just sends out the
[1:10:34] golden scepter confidence in her King
[1:10:37] and now he had greater confidence in her
[1:10:41] there's also a type of a man and a wife
[1:10:43] husband and a wife Naturally Speaking
[1:10:45] bear everything to your husband bear
[1:10:47] everything to your wife there'd be no
[1:10:49] secrets and there'll be a confidence
[1:10:51] there that nothing can come between
[1:10:54] Esther found her confidence in the king
[1:10:57] when she surrendered everything to him
[1:10:59] amen
[1:11:00] now you notice one thing the king he
[1:11:03] doesn't say hey let's go ahead and write
[1:11:05] a document we're going to make you know
[1:11:06] I'm gonna I'm gonna overrule what I said
[1:11:08] and we're gonna make a truce
[1:11:11] no the king said
[1:11:13] give the Jews whatever they need to
[1:11:15] fight back
[1:11:17] you see when it comes to God there is no
[1:11:19] truces with the Enemy
[1:11:21] don't make a truce with the enemy
[1:11:24] Deuteronomy chapter 9 verse 1 to 8.
[1:11:34] hear o Israel Thou Art to pass over
[1:11:36] Jordan this day to go into possess
[1:11:38] Nations greater and mightier than
[1:11:39] thyself cities Great and fenced to
[1:11:42] Heaven A people great and Tall the
[1:11:43] children of the anakims whom thou
[1:11:45] knowest and of whom thou has heard say
[1:11:47] who can stand before the children of
[1:11:48] anach understand therefore they say that
[1:11:51] the Lord thy God is he which goeth
[1:11:52] before thee as a consuming fire
[1:11:55] he shall destroy them and he shall bring
[1:11:57] them down before thy face so shalt thou
[1:12:00] drive them out and Destroy them quickly
[1:12:02] as the Lord hath said unto thee
[1:12:09] speak not an eye not thou and thine
[1:12:11] heart after that the Lord thy God has
[1:12:13] cast him out from before they saying for
[1:12:15] my righteousness the Lord hath brought
[1:12:17] me in to possess this land
[1:12:19] he says this is not done for your
[1:12:20] righteousness but this is done to
[1:12:22] condemn those those in the Promised Land
[1:12:25] and he goes on to say he says don't
[1:12:26] forget
[1:12:29] um actually I just feel led to just skip
[1:12:31] past that part so let's end in verse
[1:12:33] three understand therefore to say that
[1:12:34] the Lord thy God is he which goeth over
[1:12:36] before thee as a consuming fire so God
[1:12:38] went before them there was still a fight
[1:12:41] the Jews still fought against all those
[1:12:44] people that rose up to take their land
[1:12:46] and their possessions and they had
[1:12:49] they barely lost anybody and they had an
[1:12:51] overwhelming victory
[1:12:54] they didn't make a truce with the Enemy
[1:12:56] if you turn with me to Joshua chapter 9.
[1:12:59] now Deuteronomy
[1:13:01] ends make sure I'm going to say this
[1:13:04] right in the Joshua as they're crossing
[1:13:07] over the river Jordan Joshua chapter
[1:13:09] nine we find them directly I find it's
[1:13:11] interesting this is directly after the
[1:13:13] battle of AI now you know what happened
[1:13:14] in aega in AI Aiken sinned against the
[1:13:18] camp of Israel because he took the
[1:13:19] garments of The Spoils of
[1:13:22] Jericho
[1:13:24] Aiken had a religious spirit
[1:13:27] do you know a religious spirit feeds on
[1:13:30] past truth amen truth out of season
[1:13:35] because when they catch victory over AI
[1:13:37] they took all the spoils
[1:13:39] if Aiken had waited
[1:13:42] for present truth
[1:13:45] he would have not got a religious spirit
[1:13:47] that brought him to death
[1:13:51] so here we hit we find and they had the
[1:13:53] victory over Ai and directly after that
[1:13:56] oh I I the devil knows when to come
[1:13:59] along you're feeling high on the hog and
[1:14:02] just as spiritual and anointed as
[1:14:04] possible
[1:14:07] and you forget
[1:14:09] it's not you
[1:14:12] you've had the victory over AI you got
[1:14:14] rid of the sin in the camp you see the
[1:14:16] sin of the camp can be the church or you
[1:14:18] sitting in your life got rid of the sin
[1:14:20] in your life you're feeling high on the
[1:14:22] hog and and you have the Victory and
[1:14:24] everything's going good and you feel
[1:14:25] spiritual and anointed but you get in
[1:14:28] your flesh
[1:14:29] you get you get in your flesh you get a
[1:14:32] little bit too religious
[1:14:34] in the other side that religious spirit
[1:14:36] and here is Joshua in chapter nine and
[1:14:40] you can go read it if you want and a
[1:14:43] people out of gibeon come to Joshua
[1:14:46] and they they put old garments on them
[1:14:48] wore out shoes and they get moldy bread
[1:14:50] and they act like they've been traveling
[1:14:53] for months oh the bread was fresh when
[1:14:55] we left and now it's moldy and our
[1:14:57] clothes were brand new when we left and
[1:14:59] now they're Rags but they only traveled
[1:15:01] three days
[1:15:03] they were the devil is
[1:15:05] wild the Wilds of the devil
[1:15:08] and um it and so Joshua says look uh 9
[1:15:13] verse 14 and the men took of their
[1:15:15] victuals and asked not counsel at the
[1:15:18] mouth of the Lord
[1:15:20] and Joshua made peace with them and made
[1:15:22] a league with them to let them live and
[1:15:24] the princes of the congregation swear
[1:15:25] unto them
[1:15:27] they were told to annihilate everyone
[1:15:30] that stood on their promise
[1:15:33] but they made a truce
[1:15:35] with the Enemy
[1:15:37] you say well they got deceived yes they
[1:15:39] did but why did they get deceased
[1:15:42] because they sought not the counsel of
[1:15:44] the Lord
[1:15:45] they didn't go to the Lord sometimes
[1:15:47] they get in a position where we just we
[1:15:49] forget it's not us
[1:15:51] it's Christ
[1:15:53] it cannot stand on your own two feet
[1:15:56] ever
[1:15:58] it's got to be Christ
[1:16:01] now there comes a place when you're
[1:16:03] living in a close relationship with
[1:16:05] Christ you can't necessarily have to you
[1:16:07] know actually
[1:16:08] spray
[1:16:09] you know over what you're gonna do
[1:16:11] but you're seeking the Lord's will
[1:16:13] always and in all things and you're
[1:16:16] listening for the Lord to say no turn
[1:16:18] right
[1:16:18] not left
[1:16:21] go ahead and pull that pull up that
[1:16:23] slide it's got to be all the word amen
[1:16:27] all the time
[1:16:31] all the word
[1:16:32] all the time
[1:16:35] we were talking about this in class
[1:16:37] let's see how he's gurning at me
[1:16:39] on last Sunday morning
[1:16:41] I remember God's provided place of
[1:16:43] worship you can find God
[1:16:45] you can find God's provide a place of
[1:16:47] worship
[1:16:48] out somewhere listening to a tape
[1:16:51] you can find God's place of worship
[1:16:53] sitting in church
[1:16:55] but you can't do one without the other
[1:16:57] per se
[1:16:58] you can't just come to church you gotta
[1:17:00] feed on the word
[1:17:03] it's the Bible says get away quietly
[1:17:05] feed on the word the Bible says go to
[1:17:08] church
[1:17:09] we know to go and lit feet on the word
[1:17:11] listen to the tapes
[1:17:13] but the Bible says the faithful Ministry
[1:17:16] you don't just take a slice here and a
[1:17:19] slice there it's got to be all the word
[1:17:21] amen all the time
[1:17:23] and you know what happens when it's not
[1:17:26] the devil hides if you find a church
[1:17:30] that's not founded on all the word all
[1:17:33] the time there'll be people who struggle
[1:17:36] for years and never find victory
[1:17:40] because the devil's hiding in the
[1:17:41] shadows of almost truth
[1:17:46] full surrender
[1:17:49] you know almost truth equals almost
[1:17:51] victories
[1:17:55] but it's not about well I almost met you
[1:17:57] see that guys I almost made nobody cares
[1:18:02] because almost is not all the way
[1:18:06] almost even has the word all in it
[1:18:09] but only one L
[1:18:12] it's got to be all the word all the time
[1:18:15] you've got to be able to take the idea
[1:18:17] from the front to the back
[1:18:25] now if something happens when you find
[1:18:27] yourself in position God is calling out
[1:18:29] to your heart pulling on you to awake to
[1:18:33] righteousness First Corinthians 15 33-34
[1:18:36] be not deceived evil Communications
[1:18:39] corrupt good manners awake to
[1:18:42] righteousness and sin not for some have
[1:18:45] not the knowledge of God I speak this to
[1:18:47] your shame
[1:18:49] Ephesians 5
[1:18:52] verse 8.
[1:18:54] and there's a lot of scriptures tonight
[1:18:59] Ephesians 5 verse 8.
[1:19:03] there we go
[1:19:06] for you were sometimes Darkness but now
[1:19:08] are you light in the Lord walk as
[1:19:11] children of light for the fruit of the
[1:19:13] spirit is in all goodness and
[1:19:14] righteousness and Truth proving what is
[1:19:17] acceptable unto the Lord and have no
[1:19:19] fellowship with the unfruitful works of
[1:19:21] darkness but rather reprove them
[1:19:23] somebody asked me the other day about
[1:19:25] something and I won't say because I
[1:19:27] don't want to call them out
[1:19:29] but let me tell you if you ever have a
[1:19:30] question about something
[1:19:32] is it unfruitful works of darkness
[1:19:35] you say well the Bible doesn't exactly
[1:19:37] say it's bad but what kind of fruits
[1:19:41] that's it come from it
[1:19:43] unfruitful works works of darkness
[1:19:46] but rather reprove them
[1:19:52] for it is a shame even to speak of those
[1:19:54] things which are done of them in secret
[1:19:57] willing to know
[1:20:00] what they do
[1:20:03] we don't need to talk about what they do
[1:20:06] in New Orleans
[1:20:07] on their Mardi Gras we don't need to
[1:20:09] discuss sin like that
[1:20:13] but all things that are approved are
[1:20:15] made manifest by the light for
[1:20:17] whatsoever does make manifest is light
[1:20:19] in other words all things he says
[1:20:20] reprove those fruitful works of darkness
[1:20:22] and then he says the light will make
[1:20:25] manifest them that's right the darkness
[1:20:27] can only hide for so long
[1:20:29] I preached the sermon appointment with
[1:20:31] Destiny
[1:20:32] and and um
[1:20:35] do you know that coming to church and
[1:20:37] hearing what's being said tonight
[1:20:40] pushes you along
[1:20:43] to your appointment with Destiny you
[1:20:45] hear the word and you hear the word I
[1:20:47] heard the word and I heard the word and
[1:20:49] I heard the word and then finally I made
[1:20:51] this step
[1:20:57] you have an appointment with Destiny
[1:20:59] but you got to come and hear the word
[1:21:01] and hear the word and hear the word and
[1:21:03] hear the correction
[1:21:04] amen of the word wherefore he saith
[1:21:08] awake thou that sleepest and arise from
[1:21:11] the dead and Christ shall give thee
[1:21:14] light
[1:21:16] amen the scripture talks about light as
[1:21:19] a substance
[1:21:20] give you light
[1:21:23] become children of light
[1:21:26] it discusses the word it discusses the
[1:21:29] concept of life as is something you can
[1:21:30] pick up and hold amen let me ask you
[1:21:33] what is a light Christ amen what is
[1:21:36] Christ faith
[1:21:38] what is Faith a substance amen something
[1:21:41] you can literally take a hold of
[1:21:45] you can't grab Darkness
[1:21:47] but you can take light to the darkness
[1:21:50] and the Darkness comprehends it not
[1:21:53] you know
[1:21:55] I've said it before or maybe you
[1:21:57] remember if Mary walked through those
[1:21:59] doors tonight pregnant and told you it
[1:22:02] was by an Angel would you believe her
[1:22:09] if you had the right an awning and you
[1:22:10] had the right Spirit you would
[1:22:12] but how odd that would be did you know
[1:22:16] every day you walk outside you're
[1:22:18] pregnant Mary amen
[1:22:21] and the world just can't accept it
[1:22:24] so don't expect them to accept it
[1:22:27] don't try to convince them to ex accept
[1:22:30] it
[1:22:31] just keep bearing the life
[1:22:34] also you can't hide hide it when you're
[1:22:37] she couldn't hide being pregnant
[1:22:39] it was obvious
[1:22:41] I pray God help will be obvious
[1:22:44] that your life is growing inside of me
[1:22:47] awake thou that sleepest and arise from
[1:22:49] the dead and Christ shall give Delight
[1:22:52] in the uncertain sound
[1:22:55] 1960. behold I'll send you Elijah the
[1:22:57] prophet before that great and terrible
[1:22:59] day shall destroy the world
[1:23:03] he'll restore the hearts of the children
[1:23:05] back to the original faith
[1:23:07] back to the gospel back to the power of
[1:23:09] God back to the real Holy Spirit back to
[1:23:12] Christ again before that great day come
[1:23:15] he says we hear the trumpet sounding oh
[1:23:17] my what is it awake your Saints of the
[1:23:19] Lord why Slumber when the end is nearing
[1:23:22] let's get ready for that final call if
[1:23:25] it gives an uncertain sound who shall
[1:23:27] prepare themselves for battle if it's
[1:23:29] uncertain but it's not uncertain people
[1:23:32] say what is this stuff they're talking
[1:23:34] about the Holy Spirit reading the very
[1:23:36] minds of the people and the thing that
[1:23:37] he's doing that's the certainty of the
[1:23:40] sound of the Gospel Christ said it would
[1:23:42] be that way
[1:23:44] a couple of paragraphs down there's only
[1:23:46] one certain sound that's the gospel
[1:23:48] prepare for the battle what battle the
[1:23:51] coming of the Lord prepare yourself for
[1:23:53] battle now against evil when evil is
[1:23:55] besetting the people on every hand
[1:23:57] everything going wrong and home life
[1:24:00] going wrong and covet falling
[1:24:05] and Russia attacking Ukraine
[1:24:10] and threats of war and homes splitting
[1:24:13] up and motherhood in other words people
[1:24:15] denying motherhood and it going low and
[1:24:19] immorals
[1:24:20] among the people and distrust amongst
[1:24:23] one another all denominations
[1:24:25] all message churches fussing and stewing
[1:24:28] but what you want to do be certain
[1:24:31] prepare yourself for the battle
[1:24:35] now the only way Feast of the Trump it's
[1:24:37] 1964. now the only way you'll know what
[1:24:39] the trumpet sound is is to look what the
[1:24:41] music sheet says that's all it's a great
[1:24:43] Symphony C and beating
[1:24:46] Psalms 144 verse 1. this takes me into
[1:24:49] the next Point blessed be the Lord my
[1:24:50] strength which teaches My Hands to War
[1:24:53] and my fingers to fight
[1:24:56] if you look up that word hands in the
[1:24:58] scripture means strength yeah
[1:25:01] so he says Lord You Are My Strength
[1:25:04] teach my strength to war
[1:25:08] train me how to use the strength you've
[1:25:11] given me to war
[1:25:13] you have the whole open word you have
[1:25:16] the strength that you need but when you
[1:25:18] lose a battle
[1:25:20] you need to ask God show me train me how
[1:25:24] to use my strength to war
[1:25:26] say to God we're in a battle every day
[1:25:29] of Our Lives we battle why why do we get
[1:25:33] sleepy in church
[1:25:37] and you can stay awake for hours doing
[1:25:39] something else
[1:25:40] why do weeds grow uninhibited
[1:25:44] you just barely sprinkle accidentally
[1:25:46] spill a little fertilizer in a forest
[1:25:48] the blue weeds grows next door you do a
[1:25:51] little so we you gotta fight for grass
[1:25:53] to grow the Earth is under a curse why
[1:25:57] do you gotta fight for grass to grow in
[1:25:58] your life because your body is under a
[1:26:00] curse it's a battle that you're in amen
[1:26:03] First Corinthians 14 8 for if the
[1:26:06] trumpet give an uncertain sound who
[1:26:07] shall prepare himself to the battle you
[1:26:10] see you will never find what is an
[1:26:13] uncertain sound a religious spirit
[1:26:14] Antichrist amen it doesn't ring true
[1:26:18] it doesn't blast truth
[1:26:21] and when you're listening to an
[1:26:23] uncertain sound
[1:26:25] so when the devil lies to you and he
[1:26:28] says you're defeated
[1:26:30] that's an uncertain sound because I got
[1:26:32] another word for you tonight from the
[1:26:34] gospel trumpet that says you are more
[1:26:37] than a conqueror
[1:26:38] you could have the victory over the fear
[1:26:41] in your life you can have a victory over
[1:26:43] your complacency amen
[1:26:48] especially as men we like to live in our
[1:26:50] nothing box and just be complacent
[1:26:52] and drift and leave the things that we
[1:26:55] need to take care of I said well that's
[1:26:57] carnal I'm I'm listening to a tape
[1:27:00] all things in balance
[1:27:02] are you taking care of your Affairs are
[1:27:05] you dealing with what you need to be
[1:27:06] doing don't become complacent and just
[1:27:08] drift through life and what happens
[1:27:10] happens take it by the tail
[1:27:15] Lord teach my strength to war and my
[1:27:18] fingers to fight
[1:27:21] the only way you find strength is when
[1:27:23] you live in present truth
[1:27:25] I wrote something I'm not I'm not trying
[1:27:28] to make this super spiritual but I wrote
[1:27:30] something last night when I was studying
[1:27:32] underneath the anointing and I don't
[1:27:33] normally just put written out things but
[1:27:35] I wanted to just read this so these this
[1:27:37] is my words don't make a truce and I'm
[1:27:39] doing this in closing here tonight
[1:27:42] don't make a truce with the Enemy to
[1:27:44] appease him to keep him quiet the devil
[1:27:47] loves secrecy to hide in the shadows of
[1:27:50] almost truth the people find themselves
[1:27:52] in bondage when the whole truth is not
[1:27:55] present all the word all the time none
[1:27:59] of this half-truth 99 truth we need the
[1:28:02] power of the pure unadulterated word of
[1:28:05] God now this must be applied to a church
[1:28:07] but also to your life anything hanging
[1:28:10] on that's almost truth will riddle your
[1:28:13] life with almost victories remember
[1:28:16] Aiken that religious spirit in the camp
[1:28:18] of Israel affected the whole body body
[1:28:21] as in church and body as in you and me
[1:28:24] as individuals the scripture says is
[1:28:27] your that if your heart condemns you
[1:28:30] you must go make it right amen you must
[1:28:33] come boldly Before the Throne like
[1:28:36] Esther but you will never do so if the
[1:28:38] devil has blackmail on you
[1:28:40] Esther's approach would have never come
[1:28:42] off right if she had sin hanging in her
[1:28:45] life she would have never found the
[1:28:47] courage to step into the king's court
[1:28:49] Uninvited unless she was perfectly
[1:28:51] aligned with the king's will live in
[1:28:55] present truth
[1:28:57] magicians if you come tonight Matthew 24
[1:28:59] 28 for whereas whoever the carcass is
[1:29:01] there will the Eagles be gathered
[1:29:03] together
[1:29:04] Eagles vultures it depends on the state
[1:29:08] of the carcass
[1:29:10] is it fresh is it present truth why did
[1:29:13] Brothers say over and over and over
[1:29:14] again people looking to what God has did
[1:29:16] and look into what God's going to do
[1:29:18] they're out of season
[1:29:21] so they're speaking words that might
[1:29:23] seem true they're they're acting like
[1:29:25] the truth
[1:29:27] but there'll be no victory
[1:29:29] Aiken was acting like the rest of the
[1:29:31] children of Israel he went to battle the
[1:29:33] fight why didn't he die in the battle
[1:29:35] foreign
[1:29:37] because God wanted to show us a lesson
[1:29:42] care of that Aiken that's in your life
[1:29:46] and watch God brings Victory it's hard
[1:29:48] it's in it's you know maybe depending on
[1:29:50] the situation might be embarrassing
[1:29:52] but when you get to take that letter
[1:29:54] that the devil's written to tell you
[1:29:55] look you got no rights
[1:29:59] and you know he's right
[1:30:01] but when you get to a place where you
[1:30:02] take care of that you can burn it
[1:30:06] you can burn the devil's blackmail
[1:30:08] and now you have full confidence to step
[1:30:11] into the king's court Sparrow heads
[1:30:13] tonight
[1:30:14] Heavenly Father Lord Jesus I just
[1:30:17] sometimes Lord I just get to this place
[1:30:20] ministering Lord just overwhelmed on the
[1:30:24] inside but but no words further to come

[1:30:36] [Music]

[1:30:48] you don't ever have the words to express
[1:30:50] our thank you
[1:30:52] [Music]
[1:30:54] Lord we know what it can be to live
[1:30:56] underneath that condemnation
[1:30:59] but if we can burn the devil's blackmail
[1:31:03] we'll find our victory
[1:31:05] Lord let help us identify to us father
[1:31:09] if we're living in almost truth
[1:31:11] [Music]
[1:31:15] no matter the disruption it would cost

[1:31:20] into the total truth because that is
[1:31:22] where we find Liberty Lord

[1:31:47] help us to be
[1:31:49] put on the armor of light your scripture
[1:31:52] says
[1:31:54] that God when the devianites would come
[1:31:57] to deceive us we would be ready to seek
[1:32:00] the counsel of the Lord

[1:33:55] night but the presence of the Lord is
[1:33:57] really strong tonight
[1:34:00] and I was I was listening to to uh
[1:34:03] brother Tim Pruitt and he was
[1:34:05] ministering
[1:34:07] he takes this story from the Song of
[1:34:10] Solomon where
[1:34:12] [Music]
[1:34:13] the maiden or the bride is laying on the
[1:34:15] bed inside the house and the bridegroom
[1:34:17] comes later than she expected and he's
[1:34:19] calling out for her
[1:34:21] to open the door
[1:34:25] he's beckoning through with her voice
[1:34:27] please come open the door
[1:34:29] and she's making all these excuses why
[1:34:31] she can't she's already washed her feet
[1:34:33] she's already gone into bed she can't do
[1:34:36] it and she puts it off and he keeps
[1:34:38] beckoning and finally she drags herself
[1:34:40] up and she complains that she goes to
[1:34:43] the door
[1:34:44] and when she opens the door he's gone
[1:34:46] all he's left is a little myrrh to
[1:34:49] remember him by and she goes out into
[1:34:51] the streets and and she's calling for
[1:34:53] him looking for him knowing feeling
[1:34:55] guilty for for denying her bridegroom
[1:34:58] when he beckoned with his voice to come
[1:35:01] in
[1:35:03] and she find herself herself at the
[1:35:05] Watchman watchmans are the ministers and
[1:35:09] they correct her what are you doing out
[1:35:10] here you need to go back home and and
[1:35:13] she takes the correction as beating and
[1:35:15] they were being so mean but it was the
[1:35:17] guilt in her heart for denying the voice
[1:35:21] of Her bridegroom that makes her
[1:35:22] perceive the words of the minister in
[1:35:26] such a fashion
[1:35:28] Saints the Lord comes and he knocks
[1:35:32] and we can spend all day talking about
[1:35:34] oh we're predestinated we'll accept it

[1:36:25] I had to do is say quietly Lord I know
