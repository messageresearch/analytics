[49:17] and um just remember them in prayer amen
[49:21] that God would just bless them and I
[49:25] don't know if there's been anyone we
[49:27] missed well Lord forgive us for
[49:30] um just sometimes
[49:32] getting so preoccupied hey man I want to
[49:35] speak to you tonight thank you so much
[49:37] amen just a lovely song service tonight
[49:40] uh just really really touches my heart
[49:44] because it goes you might say right with
[49:46] my thoughts amen and as we are on this
[49:50] journey tonight I want to talk to you
[49:52] about a natural change
[49:54] from Hungary
[49:56] to satisfy
[49:58] and you see for the bride of Christ
[50:01] that comes naturally
[50:05] God does now you know it's interesting
[50:08] and we'll touch on that and I'll do my
[50:10] best to to bring you know the correct
[50:12] balance as I speak it but you see my
[50:15] brother and sister will look at this and
[50:17] realize that we as Sons and Daughters of
[50:19] God will never in our life become
[50:22] completely satisfied
[50:24] there's always going to be a yearning
[50:27] yeah there's always going to be a hunger
[50:31] but yet as we go tonight I trust that
[50:34] we'll see this very clearly out of the
[50:36] scripture the prophet of God lays it out
[50:38] quite nicely we come to a place that we
[50:40] no longer hunger
[50:42] does that make sense
[50:44] we're no longer hunger but we are never
[50:47] quite satisfied in the yearning
[50:50] and so it's there in that I don't want
[50:53] to get ahead of myself but you know when
[50:55] we were in the world right uh uh people
[50:58] do drugs they're often searching for
[51:00] something alcohol as they're searching
[51:03] for something and all kinds of events
[51:05] and activities and throw ourselves some
[51:08] of us know what it's like you know to
[51:10] throw ourselves into things
[51:13] and I just loved how a Family Camp
[51:15] brother Stevens like you know what I'm
[51:18] that guy I'm that guy that just becomes
[51:21] just I gotta do this
[51:23] and you know
[51:25] addictive behavior
[51:27] well I'm glad tonight I'm addicted to
[51:29] Jesus Christ amen that there is
[51:32] something but in the human element we
[51:36] always are kind of looking I think
[51:38] tonight
[51:40] you know brother Sergey would know this
[51:42] brother Ivan would know this for sure
[51:45] brother Trevor driving a truck
[51:47] you can drive the same route a hundred
[51:49] times but there's just something about
[51:51] or climbing up to the Continental Divide
[51:55] and just as you roll over it especially
[51:58] if you roll over it at certain times of
[52:00] the day
[52:01] and there's just something that's new
[52:03] and fresh and it's that yearning it's
[52:06] something that's there that we're
[52:08] looking
[52:09] as we were communicating with brother
[52:12] Adrian today they're having a little
[52:15] family time in Glacier National Park and
[52:17] just sent me just stunning pictures
[52:20] absolutely stunning
[52:22] and we're communicating and it just
[52:25] struck me
[52:27] how beautiful Heaven Must Be
[52:30] we're looking at the natural
[52:33] and it's just so picturesque it's just
[52:36] so incredible
[52:38] and
[52:39] a beautiful Heaven is going to be
[52:42] a natural change from Hungry to
[52:45] satisfied let's turn in Luke the sixth
[52:47] chapter the 20th through 28th verses
[52:51] amen
[53:00] a little of what started this thought
[53:03] was thinking about how blessed we are
[53:06] amen can someone stop right now and just
[53:09] say you know what I don't have to think
[53:11] very much I'm blessed amen God Has Come
[53:15] not only has he saved our souls but he
[53:18] has given us a good life amen to to come
[53:21] to serve him to be able to have in the
[53:24] natural also be able just to praise him
[53:27] and to enjoy this life and you know I I
[53:31] just uh brother Johnny and sister Linda
[53:33] doing a little travel to get away from
[53:35] the heat of Arizona at this time of year
[53:38] and I'm a little envious there like and
[53:41] this is us here and this is us there and
[53:44] this is us over here and you know you
[53:47] look at that and it is the nature of
[53:49] humanity that we're just there's
[53:51] something there drawing us forward and
[53:53] because after all one Sand Dune looks
[53:55] like another right
[53:58] no
[53:59] [Laughter]
[54:02] amen Luke the sixth chapter that was not
[54:06] a trick question
[54:08] and he lifted up his eyes on his
[54:11] disciples and said blessed be ye poor
[54:14] for yours is the kingdom
[54:17] of God blessed are ye that hunger now
[54:20] for you shall be filled blessed are ye
[54:23] that weep now for ye shall laugh
[54:26] blessed are ye when men shall hate you
[54:29] and when they shall separate you from
[54:32] their company and shall reproach you and
[54:35] cast out your name as evil for the son
[54:38] of man's sake Rejoice ye in that day and
[54:42] leap for Joy for behold oh my this is a
[54:46] this is a paradox to the human flesh
[54:48] right we have just been reviled it's
[54:51] like our friendship even in the family
[54:53] I'm sorry we just can't get with you and
[54:56] yet the scripture says that we should
[54:59] rejoice in that day and leap for Joy
[55:02] Lord help me to understand amen
[55:07] for behold your reward is great in
[55:09] heaven for in like manner did their
[55:11] fathers and to the prophets but woe unto
[55:14] you that are rich for ye have received
[55:18] your consolation woe unto you that are
[55:21] full
[55:22] for ye shall hunger
[55:24] now here early in the verses if we're
[55:27] hungry we shall be filled but now they
[55:30] say they're filled and he's saying
[55:32] you're going to be hungry
[55:34] um
[55:35] yes woe unto you that laugh now for ye
[55:39] shall mourn and weep woe unto you when
[55:41] all men shall speak well of you isn't
[55:44] this a little bit of the human nature
[55:46] brothers and sisters we want people to
[55:49] speak well of us
[55:52] even to the point we might compromise or
[55:55] be silent in the face of evil because we
[55:58] don't want to change how they speak
[56:01] about us
[56:02] [Music]
[56:07] woe unto you that are full for you shall
[56:10] hunger woe unto you that laugh now for
[56:12] ye shall mourn and weep woe unto you
[56:14] when o men speak well of you for so did
[56:17] their fathers to the false prophets but
[56:20] I say unto you which here
[56:24] amen are we hearing tonight
[56:27] love your enemies do good to them which
[56:29] hate you bless them that curse you and
[56:32] pray for them which despitefully use you
[56:36] Heavenly Father we ask for your
[56:38] blessings tonight in your precious name
[56:40] amen you may be seated Saints
[56:45] I want to just elaborate for just a
[56:49] moment on this and
[56:51] draw the focus what was in
[56:55] my thoughts
[56:56] and verse 21 blessed are ye that hunger
[56:59] now for ye shall be filled
[57:02] blessed are ye that weep now for ye
[57:04] shall laugh blessed are ye when men
[57:07] shall hate you and when they shall
[57:09] separate you from their company truly my
[57:13] brother and sister the only company that
[57:15] we should be concerned about never being
[57:18] separated from would be to the presence
[57:21] of our Lord Jesus Christ wherever he
[57:23] would uh be we want to be with him the
[57:26] word says that we will be with him amen
[57:29] and as we look at this I want to just
[57:31] draw from this a thought on being
[57:34] blessed and I say tonight I feel blessed
[57:37] to be in the house of God tonight to be
[57:39] able to come not because I'm the speaker
[57:41] but just simply to come and it is that
[57:45] when we we live life my brother and
[57:47] sister we find ourselves in midweek time
[57:50] some people say well you shouldn't find
[57:52] yourself well I'll tell you what it is
[57:54] and I'll touch on this a little bit
[57:55] later often times my brother and sister
[57:58] it's not really about that I have to
[58:00] have this great spiritual until pull me
[58:03] up in the middle of the week but it's
[58:05] actually that I yearn to see the Saints
[58:07] I yearn to be in fellowship with you
[58:10] even if I don't necessarily speak to you
[58:12] we're gathered together worshiping God
[58:14] together and I believe that is some
[58:17] element that God placed in US of what's
[58:20] drawing us you might say into uh into
[58:24] the future amen is that desire now is
[58:27] our Focus the Millennium no my brother
[58:29] and sister my focus is not the
[58:31] Millennium amen my focus is beyond the
[58:34] Millennium amen the Millennium is a
[58:36] period of time that has a start and it
[58:39] has a finish but when we come before the
[58:42] Throne of almighty God to worship on
[58:44] this sea of Crystal the glass and
[58:47] standing Before the Throne of God at the
[58:49] marriage supper of the Lamb my brother
[58:51] and sister there is no end to that so
[58:54] we're not looking the Millennium don't
[58:56] don't misunderstand me the Millennium is
[58:58] going to be awesome
[58:59] amen Satan's going to be bound a
[59:01] thousand years but when that's all
[59:03] finished he's bound forever
[59:04] amen so don't just get caught up in
[59:07] trying to make it to a millennium let's
[59:09] make it amen to the kingdom and look to
[59:11] the kingdom because it's actually not a
[59:13] space of time we're looking to it's
[59:15] Christ himself and so as we look at this
[59:18] I I want to read to you out of make the
[59:21] valley full of ditches in 1952 Amen
[59:25] brother Branham says here now it's
[59:27] always good Saints I want to put this
[59:29] out there to you it's always good amen
[59:33] we have the archives on the website it's
[59:35] always good if you don't have the notes
[59:37] go back read what's before it read
[59:40] what's after it we're not trying to
[59:42] isolate something to come up with a
[59:44] peculiar thought or something off but we
[59:48] want the whole word of God Amen but
[59:50] obviously time is a constraint now when
[59:53] this meeting is closed you'll go out
[59:55] somewhere and somebody say well I'll
[59:57] tell you I got that figured out see now
[1:00:00] that was mind reading that was this that
[1:00:04] or the other and and the devil will rob
[1:00:06] everything away from you that God has
[1:00:10] given you and I want to just ask you
[1:00:12] anybody ever experience that amen the
[1:00:15] devil the robber shows up on the
[1:00:16] doorstep amen and he's trying to rob it
[1:00:19] that was good preaching tonight but it
[1:00:21] wasn't for you or that was good
[1:00:23] preaching but boy didn't he step on your
[1:00:25] toes that was good preaching but it was
[1:00:28] Irrelevant for the day we live in my
[1:00:30] brother and sister are the devil's out
[1:00:31] there like a thief amen and so you look
[1:00:34] at this the prophet saying you know
[1:00:36] he'll Rob everything away from you that
[1:00:39] God has given you now if God gives us
[1:00:42] something my brother and sister it has
[1:00:44] value
[1:00:46] amen don't look and say well that's just
[1:00:48] a little thing my brother and sister if
[1:00:51] God gave it to you it's important amen
[1:00:54] you know kind of like uh I I I saw a
[1:00:57] deal I thought was so funny you know
[1:00:59] kind of the Paradox of it uh uh uh that
[1:01:02] uh the chocolate chip cookies that were
[1:01:06] vegan or something like that and so they
[1:01:07] removed the chocolate chips
[1:01:10] that's not a chocolate chip cookie if it
[1:01:12] has no chocolate chips
[1:01:14] amen and that's what the devil's trying
[1:01:16] to make the gospel is a gospel with no
[1:01:19] power no blood and no Redemption it's
[1:01:23] just a gospel amen and so my brother and
[1:01:26] sister it doesn't apply I like chocolate
[1:01:28] chips whenever I can sneak one amen I I
[1:01:32] like them that's what makes the cookie
[1:01:33] amen just like raisins is what makes
[1:01:36] oatmeal raisin cookies amen don't call
[1:01:38] it oatmeal raisin if it's got no raisins
[1:01:40] call it oatmeal cookie amen
[1:01:44] so you look at this and you're saying
[1:01:46] God and when you when you uh let me get
[1:01:49] it well he's given you what you do when
[1:01:52] you got it in your heart just keep
[1:01:54] moving on Amen Can someone say thank you
[1:01:57] Lord saying God give me more give me
[1:02:01] more amen now here it is I want to paint
[1:02:04] a picture for a moment the devil's
[1:02:06] trying to steal what God has given you
[1:02:09] from you amen so maybe even right in the
[1:02:13] moment distraction worries of tomorrow
[1:02:15] he's trying to steal what God's given
[1:02:17] but the prophet is telling us what you
[1:02:20] do is come in that moment amen connect
[1:02:23] us together and when he's trying to
[1:02:25] steal what God give you you're saying
[1:02:27] give me more Lord give me more Lord amen
[1:02:30] the devil's trying to take it away what
[1:02:32] I want is more amen I don't want less
[1:02:35] amen I mean that's kind of like being
[1:02:37] for us pardon to put it this way that's
[1:02:40] kind of like us saying well we can be
[1:02:42] Christians without the message well my
[1:02:44] brother and sister the message is Jesus
[1:02:46] Christ so you re remove Jesus Christ out
[1:02:50] of your Christianity and what do you
[1:02:53] have
[1:02:54] much worse than a chocolate chip cookie
[1:02:57] with no chocolate chips
[1:02:58] amen so you look at that and see God
[1:03:01] give me more give me more and blessed
[1:03:05] are they that hunger and thirst for
[1:03:07] righteousness see if you even hunger for
[1:03:11] it come on let's read this together if
[1:03:14] you even hunger for it you're blessed
[1:03:17] just to hunger for it
[1:03:20] oh is that not beautiful to be blessed
[1:03:23] that just because you have a hunger down
[1:03:26] in the soul you might say this week or
[1:03:28] this month or circumstance has been bad
[1:03:31] you're blessed that you just desire that
[1:03:34] you hunger for that is a blessing that
[1:03:37] has come on from God to you amen see
[1:03:40] it's a blessing because you've got
[1:03:42] enough of God in you to hunger for
[1:03:46] righteousness now I'm going to throw
[1:03:48] this out the devil will tell you that
[1:03:50] behavior that circumstance that's not
[1:03:53] righteousness my brother and sister the
[1:03:55] prophet is saying you are blessed
[1:03:58] because you're hungering for
[1:04:00] righteousness it isn't whether you
[1:04:02] attained or you failed or a circumstance
[1:04:05] but the hunger that's in the soul is God
[1:04:09] blessing you
[1:04:10] oh my how beautiful that is
[1:04:13] amen makes my heart just happy tonight
[1:04:17] just knowing that I am blessed because
[1:04:20] down inside of me something is yearning
[1:04:23] for more
[1:04:24] hallelujah hallelujah
[1:04:27] now I want to go into
[1:04:30] first Peter
[1:04:33] the second chapter verses one through
[1:04:35] five
[1:04:37] amen
[1:04:39] just pray for me
[1:04:40] you realize when you dive into a subject
[1:04:43] sometimes if you want to make a part 200
[1:04:47] out of it then you can just take it all
[1:04:49] and move along Mosey through it but if
[1:04:51] you want to just bring us a expression
[1:04:53] in one service sometimes you you have to
[1:04:56] leave a lot of things out you have to
[1:04:58] put a lot of things to the Sun and yet
[1:05:00] it seems like when I can't remember who
[1:05:02] I am back there you get in the pulp and
[1:05:04] in every quote in scripture you've read
[1:05:06] for the last week comes a Total Recall
[1:05:08] and you want to preach them hey man it
[1:05:11] just is how it is wherefore laying aside
[1:05:13] all malice and all guile
[1:05:16] and hypocrisies and envies in all evil
[1:05:19] speakings
[1:05:21] that's a lot of stuff to lay aside
[1:05:23] and the age that we live in my brother
[1:05:25] and sister that's that's a lot of laying
[1:05:27] down
[1:05:28] as newborn babes desire this sincere
[1:05:31] milk of the word that ye may grow
[1:05:34] thereby
[1:05:35] if so be have tasted that the Lord is
[1:05:39] gracious now to have tasted it my
[1:05:42] brother and sister you had to be a
[1:05:45] partaker of it this is to be a tasting
[1:05:49] of it is not something that is just
[1:05:52] superficial but it is something that has
[1:05:54] touched not only your spiritual senses
[1:05:57] but will have touched you in your
[1:05:59] physical senses amen we'll have spoke to
[1:06:03] you and moved you in such a fashion that
[1:06:06] you now have a recall about what that
[1:06:09] was
[1:06:13] are you with me
[1:06:15] a recall what it was the first time the
[1:06:18] Holy Spirit come down and fell upon you
[1:06:20] and you are there and you realize my
[1:06:23] life will never be the same ever again
[1:06:26] and you can stand and say thank you for
[1:06:29] that lord it's not a moment that you say
[1:06:31] with regret I got saved and my life will
[1:06:34] never be the same amen you stand up with
[1:06:37] joy and say thank you Lord because now I
[1:06:40] have tasted of the goodness of God and
[1:06:43] my life does not want to be the same
[1:06:46] amen
[1:06:48] to whom coming as unto a living Stone
[1:06:51] disallowed indeed of men but chosen of
[1:06:54] God and precious ye also now is
[1:06:56] including us as Lively stones are built
[1:07:00] up a spiritual house a holy priesthood
[1:07:04] to offer up spiritual sacrifices
[1:07:08] acceptable to God by Jesus Christ so we
[1:07:11] see and this is the part where I draw
[1:07:13] this in you take a newborn baby amen and
[1:07:17] that baby my brother and sister when it
[1:07:19] is hungry
[1:07:21] it just goes in the corner and pulls a
[1:07:24] blanket around itself and falls asleep
[1:07:28] none of our babies did they raised the
[1:07:30] roof
[1:07:31] if I'd had sense enough to block the
[1:07:33] roof up at that time I'd have had a two
[1:07:34] or three story house
[1:07:36] but when a baby is hungry
[1:07:38] amen they let
[1:07:40] Mom know
[1:07:42] dad know however you want to put this
[1:07:45] and when a son or daughter of God has
[1:07:47] tasted of the good things of God and
[1:07:49] they become hungry amen they don't go
[1:07:52] find a quiet corner and try to put it
[1:07:55] all behind them they start crying out
[1:07:58] amen and saying you know what Lord I'm
[1:08:01] hungry and I want to be fed I don't want
[1:08:05] to just come to church and just hear
[1:08:07] about how it would be this or that over
[1:08:09] there I want something I can take home
[1:08:12] with me something that has a holding
[1:08:15] power something that will sustain me in
[1:08:18] laodicea
[1:08:19] amen some people say well you know they
[1:08:22] shouldn't have two problems you know
[1:08:23] maybe they're maybe they're retired or
[1:08:25] maybe you know the wife or whatever the
[1:08:28] kids are home school they're not even
[1:08:29] out in the public my brother and sister
[1:08:31] the devil doesn't need to take you to
[1:08:32] the mall
[1:08:33] the devil doesn't need to take you out
[1:08:36] here to a theater the devil will come
[1:08:38] and knock on your door and slip in under
[1:08:41] the door amen or whatever it takes that
[1:08:45] that he can do that and we realize as it
[1:08:47] is that you know the devil he might take
[1:08:50] his man but he never takes that spirit
[1:08:52] and that spirit's there amen so we look
[1:08:55] at this now this newborn baby is
[1:08:58] Desiring
[1:08:59] now my brother and sister the only way
[1:09:01] that that baby will actually get amen if
[1:09:04] it's a nursing baby the only way it will
[1:09:07] actually get satisfied is to cry out and
[1:09:10] let mother know I am hungry amen and you
[1:09:14] take a mother amen never been there I
[1:09:16] probably was not even a very diligent
[1:09:18] dad but you have a mother amen and they
[1:09:22] can recognize a cry whether it's a cry
[1:09:25] of for attention it's a cry for Hunger
[1:09:28] can we say Amen mom say Amen recognize
[1:09:30] what that baby's Desiring my dad's like
[1:09:33] why is a kid making noise and Mom is
[1:09:35] saying it's got a wet diaper or it's
[1:09:38] hungry or whatever it is they recognize
[1:09:40] that and Our Father which art in Heaven
[1:09:43] amen my father Abba Father Knows What My
[1:09:47] Cry is knows what your cry is amen
[1:09:51] sometimes our cry is not even for us it
[1:09:54] is for someone in our family or someone
[1:09:56] in the church or a friend or a need and
[1:09:59] God recognize nice was that cry but
[1:10:01] sometimes the cry is an anguish that is
[1:10:04] inside the heart or soul of a son or
[1:10:07] daughter of God because they know
[1:10:09] there's another position they desire to
[1:10:11] obtain there's another position they
[1:10:14] desire to move into and not as it is
[1:10:17] defined is a heart's cry amen and when a
[1:10:20] heart's cry starts to cry out and say
[1:10:22] Lord I want more of you I need more of
[1:10:26] you Lord I'm hungry and I want to be fed
[1:10:29] that cry my brother and sister comes to
[1:10:32] the throne of God God doesn't say ah
[1:10:35] they can wait
[1:10:37] amen God says I'm going to put in motion
[1:10:40] what it is to satisfy the hunger of this
[1:10:44] son or daughter of God now satisfy that
[1:10:47] that hunger and The Thirst amen and so
[1:10:50] is this newborn baby is starting to cry
[1:10:53] out amen it elicits or brings into
[1:10:55] action it causes something to be set in
[1:10:58] motion that satisfies that and I can
[1:11:01] tell you right now just reading the
[1:11:03] prophet putting in paraphrased words
[1:11:05] here the prophet of God says I've never
[1:11:08] seen God fail to satisfy the soul of a
[1:11:13] son or daughter of God
[1:11:15] Hallelujah my brother and sister never
[1:11:17] see it now you can take this scripture
[1:11:20] never see Sons and Daughters of God
[1:11:21] begging bread now my brother and sister
[1:11:24] let's apply that natural amen apply that
[1:11:27] spiritual you have a need you cry out
[1:11:30] but you know what the devil does to us
[1:11:31] he causes us to go silent
[1:11:34] he causes us to go silent he paralyzes
[1:11:37] us and we have a need and yet we kind of
[1:11:40] deep down maybe feel like we're not
[1:11:42] worthy to call out to God not worthy to
[1:11:44] say Lord you know I need you to come on
[1:11:46] this scene maybe we had a temper tantrum
[1:11:49] that's something that might just cause
[1:11:50] us to hesitate amen but it's there that
[1:11:53] we are bound now by the circumstance and
[1:11:57] God says I don't care what your
[1:11:58] circumstance is cry out I want to hear
[1:12:01] that you're hungry I want to hear that
[1:12:04] you need something
[1:12:07] amen
[1:12:11] let's go to Luke the 15th chapter
[1:12:15] amen
[1:12:17] now this scripture my brother and sister
[1:12:19] has been preached many times many places
[1:12:21] I want to just bring it as a little
[1:12:23] reference tonight amen and as we would
[1:12:26] look at this we realize the Prodigal Son
[1:12:29] my brother and sister was a very very
[1:12:33] very
[1:12:34] deep subject
[1:12:38] it's not superficial about a backslidden
[1:12:40] kid that went and burned his money and
[1:12:43] then said man I made a mistake I guess
[1:12:44] I'll go home and let Daddy bail me out
[1:12:47] this is not at all my brother and sister
[1:12:49] this is talking and showing us the very
[1:12:52] depth of a heart's cry the very depth of
[1:12:55] its own our own words being spoken out
[1:12:58] and our own body our soul responding to
[1:13:02] whose words
[1:13:05] our words
[1:13:08] sometimes it comes to we have to respond
[1:13:10] to our own words
[1:13:12] or we have to speak let me rephrase that
[1:13:14] we have to speak our own words to get a
[1:13:17] response
[1:13:19] you can take the song he was there all
[1:13:22] the time
[1:13:23] my brother and sister you look at the
[1:13:25] circumstances of Life many people would
[1:13:27] say well I don't know I just have to
[1:13:29] wait till the Lord comes and gives me an
[1:13:31] answer my brother and sister most of the
[1:13:33] answers we have he's already given us
[1:13:38] he's there all the time
[1:13:41] but we are looking for more definitive
[1:13:44] answer you know shake the rafters
[1:13:47] something you know said on the porch
[1:13:49] expecting to see something happen
[1:13:54] but here's the Prodigal Son Luke 15 15.
[1:13:57] and he went and he joined himself
[1:14:02] it doesn't matter whether we're young or
[1:14:04] old but certainly to our youth
[1:14:07] be careful who you join yourself to
[1:14:10] amen he joined himself to a citizen of
[1:14:12] that country
[1:14:16] and he was sent into the fields to feed
[1:14:18] the swine
[1:14:21] it wasn't a very high class job you see
[1:14:23] in verse 16.
[1:14:25] it was left in such a position that
[1:14:27] there was nothing there for him but to
[1:14:29] fill his Bailer with the house that the
[1:14:32] same stuff the swine we're eating now
[1:14:34] don't be looking at this swine or this
[1:14:36] as as old he's out feeding the pigs my
[1:14:38] brother and sister that swine is a
[1:14:41] spirit
[1:14:43] I want you to look at it that way
[1:14:44] tonight okay would you
[1:14:46] amen so what was he left to fill himself
[1:14:50] or try to satisfy himself with the very
[1:14:54] things of the spirit of the age was
[1:14:57] satisfying or filling the bellies of
[1:15:00] those around him he's out there now in
[1:15:02] an age in a time in a place in an
[1:15:05] atmosphere and we can say it's too bad
[1:15:07] about this young man or this young woman
[1:15:09] my brother and sister do you understand
[1:15:10] how Satan can come and bring it to a
[1:15:13] place that they're feeding on something
[1:15:15] that cannot satisfy a hunger it cannot
[1:15:20] satisfy the soul but often times shame a
[1:15:24] motivating or anchoring factor in one's
[1:15:27] life and they'd say well I would go back
[1:15:28] to church I would like to go back to
[1:15:30] church I want to be in church but what
[1:15:32] will the people think I don't care what
[1:15:35] the people think my brother and sister
[1:15:36] what God wants is you and I out of the
[1:15:40] pigpen of laodicea he wants us out of
[1:15:43] that realm and so it's there that as
[1:15:45] he's coming now I want you to see the
[1:15:48] spiritual life of this young man and
[1:15:50] it's there that he is now filling his
[1:15:52] belly with the same thing that all of
[1:15:55] those around him has no man gave unto
[1:15:58] him are you with me on that I don't want
[1:15:59] to get that confused amen but I look at
[1:16:02] this and I realize how the natural and
[1:16:04] the spiritual are together and verse 17
[1:16:07] I've had one of these moments and I
[1:16:10] think every one of us had ever got you
[1:16:12] know a deal maybe raised in church we
[1:16:15] don't see it quite so much
[1:16:20] but when he came to himself
[1:16:23] now this coming to himself my brother
[1:16:26] and sister doesn't matter raised born
[1:16:29] and raised in church come out of the
[1:16:31] wickedness of the world it really
[1:16:33] doesn't matter because every one of us
[1:16:36] has to come to our self
[1:16:40] I always was a Son of God Amen I always
[1:16:45] was a daughter of God that's the moment
[1:16:49] that we come to ourself when we realize
[1:16:51] this is not who I am this is not my
[1:16:54] identity I've been feeding with the pigs
[1:16:58] amen and I'm sorry to put it that blend
[1:17:01] that you go out here my brother and
[1:17:03] sister and there's a lot of place
[1:17:05] tonight that might as well have pig pen
[1:17:07] written over the door and people are
[1:17:09] there feeding I was talking to an
[1:17:12] individual here the other day and
[1:17:14] they're Christians amen and they invited
[1:17:17] me to come to a certain place here in
[1:17:19] Nampa and shoot pool with them on Sunday
[1:17:22] afternoons
[1:17:26] I don't know my brother and sister I
[1:17:28] look out and I think it says pigpen over
[1:17:30] the door
[1:17:33] is there anything wrong with pool
[1:17:35] absolutely not
[1:17:37] I mean if you have like a camp you know
[1:17:40] they have that pool table in there
[1:17:42] some of y'all's kids was in there
[1:17:44] pushing those balls around and I don't
[1:17:46] think we're going to have to take them
[1:17:47] home and you know scrub them and do all
[1:17:50] kinds of things because some pool Spirit
[1:17:52] got on him
[1:17:55] but I tell you what the devil knows how
[1:17:56] to get us down to the pig pen
[1:17:59] because that's where we need to go to
[1:18:01] have fun
[1:18:02] I did that for quite a few years Jerry
[1:18:05] and I's marriage
[1:18:06] amen
[1:18:08] not a good memory I don't look back on
[1:18:10] it with any kind of joy of that memory
[1:18:13] in fact God works in miraculous ways and
[1:18:16] we had a visitor staying at our house I
[1:18:18] come home at maybe I don't know 12 30 or
[1:18:20] so in the morning
[1:18:22] and uh unlock the front door and step
[1:18:25] inside the house and here's this young
[1:18:26] lady got her finger in my face reading
[1:18:30] me the Riot Act
[1:18:31] about what a no good load down husband I
[1:18:35] was and that's not how Christians behave
[1:18:38] and she just read me the whole Riot Act
[1:18:41] and I blew her off and it's like you're
[1:18:43] in my house get out of my way
[1:18:46] but there was something behind that
[1:18:48] I started thinking even if I don't claim
[1:18:51] to be a Christian
[1:18:54] what am I doing there
[1:19:00] I'm in another land amongst another kind
[1:19:02] of people
[1:19:04] filling my belly
[1:19:06] full of the swine food of laodicea
[1:19:13] and in my father's house
[1:19:16] Amen in that lovely how this ties
[1:19:18] together in my father's house there's
[1:19:22] plenty of food here tonight amen in my
[1:19:25] father's house all I need to eat
[1:19:29] everything I need is in my father's
[1:19:32] house
[1:19:35] and he started to speak this I don't
[1:19:37] believe it was just a thought saying I
[1:19:39] believe he started to speak that in my
[1:19:41] father's house there's plenty of
[1:19:43] spiritual food in 2023 in my father's
[1:19:47] house there's Deliverance there's peace
[1:19:49] there's Comfort there's joy in my
[1:19:51] father's house
[1:19:53] and as he started to speak that out he
[1:19:56] started to believe his own confession so
[1:19:59] much to the point he overcome personal
[1:20:01] shame and all of those attributes that
[1:20:04] Satan tried to Heap upon him you smell
[1:20:06] like the pigs you look like the pigs you
[1:20:09] act like the pigs you can't go back to
[1:20:11] your father's house you're dressed like
[1:20:14] the world you're dressed like this
[1:20:15] you're that and yet he kept saying in my
[1:20:19] father's house
[1:20:20] In My Father's House everything I need
[1:20:24] is in my father's house and I would
[1:20:27] rather be a servant in my father's house
[1:20:31] than to be here in this big pen eating
[1:20:34] the things of laodicea
[1:20:38] amen and he starts for home
[1:20:42] and when he came to himself he said how
[1:20:44] many hired Servants of my fathers have
[1:20:47] bred enough and to spare and I perish
[1:20:50] with Hunger I will arise and go to my
[1:20:53] father
[1:20:54] and I will say to him in my evening
[1:20:56] prayers
[1:20:58] I'm not worthy
[1:21:01] come on are you with me Saints how many
[1:21:04] times we have prayed that prayer Lord I
[1:21:07] am not worthy
[1:21:10] we've never once heard him say you're
[1:21:12] right
[1:21:14] you're right you aren't Worthy
[1:21:17] go out there to the servant's quarters
[1:21:21] go down here
[1:21:23] somewhere else and find peace and
[1:21:25] comfort
[1:21:27] no I will rise go to my father and I'll
[1:21:29] say unto him father I have sinned
[1:21:31] against heaven and before thee and I'm
[1:21:33] no more worthy to be called thy son make
[1:21:36] me as one of the hired servants and he
[1:21:38] arose what's he doing he's believing his
[1:21:42] own confession
[1:21:43] God working on him down there in that
[1:21:47] land after living such squalor and
[1:21:50] living such a a horrible life and
[1:21:52] burning up his money on all kinds of
[1:21:55] things and he's down there but yet come
[1:21:57] on Saints I want you to get this he has
[1:22:00] down inside of him not the confession of
[1:22:03] laodicea he has a confession that is of
[1:22:06] heavenly amen a Godly confession he has
[1:22:10] a confession that is declaring I don't
[1:22:12] belong here and even if I am at the
[1:22:15] bottom of everything in my father's
[1:22:17] house I'm gonna be in my father's house
[1:22:20] I'm going to be a servant to my father
[1:22:23] amen excuse me for getting excited
[1:22:26] amen sometimes you store this stuff up
[1:22:28] for long enough you just get excited
[1:22:30] about it amen so he goes to his father
[1:22:34] and he arose and he come to his father
[1:22:36] but when he was a great way off
[1:22:41] that's the problem people have they
[1:22:43] think they got to make it to church to
[1:22:45] get it all right
[1:22:47] but our father sees us afar off
[1:22:50] coming
[1:22:52] right now imagine let's just take this
[1:22:54] back to the Natural sense of the
[1:22:55] scripture
[1:22:57] we used to have a hog farm
[1:23:00] most of my childhood
[1:23:02] many years after Jerry and I was married
[1:23:03] we
[1:23:04] we still raise Hogs
[1:23:10] I hope you see the humor in this
[1:23:13] I remember one time
[1:23:15] we're all dressed up to go to church
[1:23:17] the neighbor stops and says you guys
[1:23:19] have pigs out
[1:23:23] we're out there Jerry and
[1:23:25] address church dress men
[1:23:28] Church closing we're running around
[1:23:31] chasing pigs and we get them all put
[1:23:33] back in we didn't have to wrestle in the
[1:23:35] oven but we chased them around and
[1:23:37] around and whatnot got them put back in
[1:23:39] and imagine
[1:23:41] we're sitting in church
[1:23:45] and you hear behind you
[1:23:55] and you're like
[1:23:56] should have stayed home
[1:24:01] when his father
[1:24:03] went out
[1:24:05] and took possession I want you to see it
[1:24:07] my way okay tonight see it my way when
[1:24:10] his father went out and took possession
[1:24:12] of him
[1:24:15] he stunk like laodicea
[1:24:19] but what do we want to do we want to
[1:24:21] wash him up before they can do anything
[1:24:22] we got to get them and get a little
[1:24:25] perfume
[1:24:29] God says no come my son I'm gonna wrap
[1:24:32] my garment around you
[1:24:35] I'm going to make my claim on you my son
[1:24:39] who was lost has now been found
[1:24:43] nowhere does he say you come after
[1:24:49] and make sure you scrub behind your ears
[1:24:54] imagine God allows us
[1:24:56] infinite grace and mercy
[1:25:00] that allows us
[1:25:02] the mercy to come out and be delivered
[1:25:05] and the grace for us to go in I loved
[1:25:07] how brother Jose brought that to us amen
[1:25:10] my brother and sister and so here's gone
[1:25:12] saying I'm going to wrap my garment
[1:25:14] around you and you haven't even been
[1:25:16] washed yet
[1:25:18] thank you Lord
[1:25:19] thank you Lord Jesus
[1:25:22] thank you Father
[1:25:24] but you see my brother and sister one of
[1:25:26] the things the factors that God used to
[1:25:29] move him from his world it wasn't just
[1:25:33] natural hunger but there was a hunger
[1:25:36] down in his soul for a fellowship with
[1:25:38] his father again amen and this is a
[1:25:42] little difficult but I'm going to just
[1:25:43] speak at blunt and direct he's not down
[1:25:45] there at the pig pen eating the Haas
[1:25:48] saying I miss my brother
[1:25:52] it wasn't about hey just all this
[1:25:55] Fellowship my best my brother and sister
[1:25:57] there is something incredible and deep
[1:26:00] about the relationship between us as
[1:26:03] sons and daughters and our father amen a
[1:26:07] relationship that is above even the
[1:26:09] fellowship we have in the body of
[1:26:11] Believers that relationship is so much
[1:26:14] higher and that's the one we're longing
[1:26:16] for that's the one we yearn but I tell
[1:26:19] you what when you have the Holy Ghost
[1:26:21] God will bring us into fellowship and
[1:26:24] unity amen we won't have Warfare in the
[1:26:27] church we'll have unity and the love of
[1:26:30] God because what it will be is God
[1:26:32] working on you and I amen and every time
[1:26:34] my fault Rises up amen and you see my
[1:26:38] fault then God would come and says here
[1:26:40] let me put a little a a a blanket a
[1:26:43] cloak a gown over this you don't see
[1:26:47] this here because it's my grace my Mercy
[1:26:50] my blood that surrounds him and pulls
[1:26:53] them into a fellowship
[1:26:56] and they go and kill the fatted calf my
[1:26:59] brother and sister and I tell you what I
[1:27:01] remember I was talking with brother
[1:27:03] Johnny today I just remember years ago
[1:27:06] brother Harold Hildebrandt preaching on
[1:27:08] the third poll the first time I ever
[1:27:09] heard it and I was like what kind of
[1:27:12] crazy whatever is he even talking about
[1:27:14] I don't have any clue what he's even
[1:27:17] talking about and I made a little note
[1:27:19] it's just my nature how my shorthand a
[1:27:22] third pull with a little check mark
[1:27:24] check this out and you know after I
[1:27:27] started looking for the third pull this
[1:27:29] is back you know even before there
[1:27:31] really was a search you know I think it
[1:27:33] was already started to make that but I
[1:27:36] started and I would be reading the
[1:27:37] message
[1:27:38] there's third poll why didn't I ever see
[1:27:40] that before
[1:27:42] I'll pick up another there it is here it
[1:27:45] is again here it is again here it is
[1:27:47] again why because when God opens our
[1:27:51] eyes and we see the opening of the word
[1:27:54] amen no matter what the devil tries to
[1:27:57] do he tries to tell him just stay down
[1:27:59] here this is where you belong this is
[1:28:02] where your fellowship was but there's
[1:28:04] something about that intrinsic
[1:28:06] relationship with the father that draws
[1:28:09] us home amen and our heart won't be
[1:28:12] satisfied until we're back in the
[1:28:14] presence of the father
[1:28:16] oh Hallelujah and I thank God for that
[1:28:19] drawing us amen pulling us
[1:28:23] now look what we can be my brother and
[1:28:25] sister
[1:28:26] just natural be hungry for food right
[1:28:30] amen
[1:28:32] I don't know about you I I don't want to
[1:28:34] be presumptuous but I get hungry
[1:28:36] sometimes for Fellowship
[1:28:39] I I'm not the guy that always has to be
[1:28:42] around people
[1:28:44] my job I spend as much or more of my
[1:28:47] time by myself
[1:28:48] and that's good
[1:28:50] because I don't have to worry about
[1:28:51] whether I'm in the key or F or not
[1:28:54] I don't have to worry about if that
[1:28:55] verse actually goes with that song Or
[1:28:57] Not there's nobody there
[1:28:59] to tell me different
[1:29:01] now that does create bad habits
[1:29:03] so we need people to say I'm sorry those
[1:29:06] two songs are not one
[1:29:11] but even if you are a kind of a guy that
[1:29:13] can just go
[1:29:14] you know have to have some constant deal
[1:29:18] hunger
[1:29:20] for Fellowship man
[1:29:23] and that is part of what the body a
[1:29:25] Believer satisfies In You and I
[1:29:29] amen we don't have all the same hobbies
[1:29:33] and all the same things that we want to
[1:29:35] do
[1:29:38] I mean I joke about this right but we
[1:29:41] don't live in a world that we have to
[1:29:43] ask permission
[1:29:45] Church leadership can we buy a house can
[1:29:47] we buy a car
[1:29:49] can we take a vacation
[1:29:51] that's not the world we live in
[1:29:54] what we are asking
[1:29:56] is Lord
[1:29:58] I need your presence
[1:30:00] and every one of us are sitting here
[1:30:03] tonight with that desire Lord we want
[1:30:07] your presence we want to come together
[1:30:09] and fellowship Lord and our fellowship
[1:30:12] is good in the natural what's happening
[1:30:15] in our lives but if you stop and think
[1:30:17] about it our fellowship is rooted in the
[1:30:20] father
[1:30:21] amen that's where our fellowship is
[1:30:23] rooted amen if it wasn't for the Lord
[1:30:26] most of us would never meet one another
[1:30:30] amen
[1:30:31] but God rich in Mercy says you know what
[1:30:34] I'm going to make this circumstance and
[1:30:37] this and do this and cause this to
[1:30:38] happen Boo and bring all this together
[1:30:40] amen and here we are tonight as Sons and
[1:30:43] Daughters of God not in our importance
[1:30:45] not in our ability not in what we've
[1:30:48] done or what we might do but it's in the
[1:30:50] father amen and he's drawn his family
[1:30:53] together and some of the family fusses
[1:30:56] amen we see this here in this scripture
[1:30:58] some of the family fauces but basically
[1:31:01] we can say would you rather your son my
[1:31:05] your brother I mean be in the pig pen of
[1:31:07] laodicea are you going to get over your
[1:31:10] fussing and welcome him into the family
[1:31:16] that's a good way to put it brother
[1:31:18] Johnny
[1:31:19] get over it
[1:31:20] Hallelujah
[1:31:22] you see what our real hunger is for
[1:31:25] divine Fellowship that supersedes my
[1:31:28] brother and sister all natural
[1:31:29] Fellowship
[1:31:30] Amen brother Branham says in the message
[1:31:33] expectation 1950 April the 5th 1950.
[1:31:38] very simple I Cherry Picked this yes I
[1:31:40] do that once in a while amen if there's
[1:31:43] a hunger in your heart for more of God
[1:31:45] there's bound to be more of God
[1:31:47] somewhere for you to find oh thank you
[1:31:51] Lord there's more satisfy this hunger of
[1:31:54] my soul lord there's something there
[1:31:56] that I can do now my brother and sister
[1:31:58] God could just bring it laid on her
[1:32:00] doorstep but why does he choose
[1:32:03] to have us yearn for it search for it
[1:32:08] cry out for it
[1:32:10] because it's part of the molding process
[1:32:13] and without that
[1:32:16] are any of your children spoiled
[1:32:28] okay we're not going to point fingers
[1:32:34] imagine what we'd be like
[1:32:39] father
[1:32:40] I want this
[1:32:42] father give me this
[1:32:47] no
[1:32:48] God wants us
[1:32:50] to yearn to cry out to press into
[1:32:55] Lord I need more of the Holy Ghost I
[1:32:58] need more of you that's what you're
[1:33:00] saying my brother and sister we're going
[1:33:01] to identify it as Holy Ghost but I need
[1:33:04] more of you Lord
[1:33:06] amen and when you cry out enough amen
[1:33:09] the word says he comes
[1:33:12] amen he comes on the scene when you draw
[1:33:14] nigh unto him he draws nigh unto you ask
[1:33:19] what you need my brothers and sisters
[1:33:21] don't just ask us a selfish child
[1:33:23] sitting on the couch all bundled up but
[1:33:25] draw nigh to him amen and come in his
[1:33:28] present and say Lord you know my heart
[1:33:31] I'm not wanting to be just a spiritual
[1:33:34] person I want to have you Lord and I
[1:33:37] want you on display in me
[1:33:40] Hallelujah and then people say oh they
[1:33:42] think they're spiritual my brother and
[1:33:43] sister usually the person that says I
[1:33:45] think they're spiritual is the one that
[1:33:48] does not seek does not call out for does
[1:33:51] not pursue does not recognize amen and
[1:33:54] they're just jealous that somebody else
[1:33:57] has something they don't have
[1:34:00] oh that was a little blunt wasn't it
[1:34:02] amen
[1:34:03] Hallelujah
[1:34:06] now I want to hurry up and close here
[1:34:09] brother Brown says here in the
[1:34:11] Philadelphian Church age
[1:34:19] well
[1:34:25] maybe I skipped over that for a reason
[1:34:29] oh I am so glad that my holiness
[1:34:32] is not of myself
[1:34:34] I left my I left both my hands Lord
[1:34:38] oh thank you Lord
[1:34:42] I've eaten my fair share of the diet of
[1:34:45] the husk of laodicea
[1:34:52] I am glad that I am in Christ with all
[1:34:56] his wonderful attributes of
[1:34:57] righteousness imputed yea imparted unto
[1:35:02] me blessed be God forever
[1:35:05] these things saith he that is true now
[1:35:08] this word true is a very wonderful word
[1:35:12] it does not mean true in just the sense
[1:35:15] of that is the opposite of fault it
[1:35:18] expresses the perfect realization of an
[1:35:21] idea as contrasted with its partial
[1:35:25] realization
[1:35:26] okay are we all together
[1:35:29] for example we recall that Jesus said in
[1:35:31] John 6 32 Moses gave you not that bread
[1:35:35] from heaven but my father giveth you
[1:35:37] true bread from Heaven amen now I'm
[1:35:41] telling you what sister Jerry showed a
[1:35:43] deal and I won't go into detail on it
[1:35:44] but my brother and sister in the world
[1:35:46] we live in today there's literally
[1:35:48] preachers standing in pulpits I hope not
[1:35:51] a message church but preachers standing
[1:35:54] in their their uh their cloaks their
[1:35:56] gowns in churches saying this word of
[1:35:59] God is full of heirs has contradictions
[1:36:03] and is not the whole voice or a words of
[1:36:08] God
[1:36:09] man's not put in there now my brother
[1:36:11] and sister they were religious people
[1:36:14] they have churches big churches they
[1:36:16] have all kinds of things but yet Satan
[1:36:18] has come in Far Enough amen and it makes
[1:36:22] you wonder what are they feeding on
[1:36:26] they're hungry look they're humans just
[1:36:29] like you and I so we know that there's a
[1:36:33] yearning in them a hunger in them for
[1:36:36] things amen something to satisfy that
[1:36:39] but what are they feeding on
[1:36:43] whatever it is my brother and sister the
[1:36:45] prophet of God said it's polluted
[1:36:52] right so it's not just in the sense of
[1:36:54] the opposite of faults it expresses
[1:36:56] perfect realization of an idea as
[1:36:59] contrasted with its partial realization
[1:37:01] Jesus said in John 6 32 Moses gave you
[1:37:04] not that bread from heaven but my father
[1:37:06] giveth you true bread from Heaven John
[1:37:08] 15 1 I am the True Vine
[1:37:13] now my brother and sister will see no
[1:37:15] advertisement in the Bible
[1:37:18] of someone anointed of the devil
[1:37:20] standing before him saying I am the
[1:37:23] faults Vine
[1:37:27] at that point
[1:37:28] everyone anointed by a spirit
[1:37:33] is declaring
[1:37:35] I am the true wine
[1:37:38] we are the way
[1:37:48] truth
[1:37:51] error that's right
[1:37:54] so where do we discern that
[1:38:03] I'm going to say something a little
[1:38:04] controversial to you
[1:38:06] some will say we discern that in the
[1:38:09] Bible
[1:38:12] I disagree
[1:38:16] scripture says you can't even call him
[1:38:18] the Christ
[1:38:19] without the Holy Ghost
[1:38:21] you can publish all the Bibles you want
[1:38:24] and it will not give them truth
[1:38:30] relationship
[1:38:32] but you give true Revelation to a son or
[1:38:34] daughter of God the prophet of God says
[1:38:37] this becomes a brand new book
[1:38:39] oh my brother and sister we could have
[1:38:42] before God spoke to us have highlighted
[1:38:44] and highlighted and marked in reference
[1:38:47] in everything and then oh if I can make
[1:38:50] this Vivid to you and the point that God
[1:38:52] opens our eyes it becomes a brand new
[1:38:55] book in spite of all of our markings and
[1:38:57] all of our notes and references it
[1:39:00] becomes a new book it that stage
[1:39:03] amen
[1:39:05] I'm the True Vine Hebrews 9 24 for
[1:39:08] Christ is not entered into holy places
[1:39:10] made with hands which are the figures of
[1:39:13] the true but into heaven itself now to
[1:39:15] appear in the presence of God for us
[1:39:18] isn't that beautiful
[1:39:21] amen first John 2 8. you see I was glad
[1:39:24] I didn't have to I'm just read a quote
[1:39:27] to you
[1:39:28] got all the scriptures we need all
[1:39:31] referenced right there
[1:39:32] amen John 2 8 because the darkness is
[1:39:36] passed Can someone say that with me the
[1:39:39] darkness is past amen we ought to be
[1:39:42] believing that amen I don't care what
[1:39:44] the devil says and what's happening in
[1:39:46] the world the word of God says that
[1:39:49] darkness is past and we are now walking
[1:39:51] in light oh hallelujah thank you Lord
[1:39:54] that I can walk in the light amen the
[1:39:58] True Light now shyness since this word
[1:40:00] indeed expresses perfect realization as
[1:40:03] against the idea of partial realization
[1:40:05] as Illustrated in these verses we can
[1:40:08] Now understand as never before anti-type
[1:40:11] contrasting with type and substance with
[1:40:14] Shadow take the example now of Manna
[1:40:17] From Heaven
[1:40:18] God sent down Angel bread from heaven
[1:40:20] for Israel but that bread did not
[1:40:23] satisfy in fact let me just take that
[1:40:26] another step further it comes so far
[1:40:29] from satisfying that they come to the
[1:40:31] place they murmured about a gift from
[1:40:34] God that was given to them without any
[1:40:38] uh expense on their part any labor on
[1:40:40] their part any costs you might say on
[1:40:43] their part and they murmured against it
[1:40:45] and rebelled against it
[1:40:49] and yet it was the very life come to
[1:40:51] them
[1:40:58] I cannot explain Hebrews 28 19.
[1:41:03] but Acts 2 38 has got to be false
[1:41:10] very gift of manna
[1:41:13] that fell from heaven
[1:41:15] to give life
[1:41:18] to sons and daughters
[1:41:23] I don't know how they make this Mana
[1:41:25] but they really ought to I can just see
[1:41:28] some people that were really good Cooks
[1:41:31] you know if they would just add a little
[1:41:33] cinnamon
[1:41:35] we like little miniature cinnamon rolls
[1:41:39] if they were just this if God would just
[1:41:41] do this
[1:41:43] if God would just choose something else
[1:41:46] why doesn't he drop us a T-bone every
[1:41:48] once in a while
[1:41:51] but it was God's provided way
[1:41:54] and God says I'm here to satisfy your
[1:41:57] natural hunger
[1:42:00] now bear with me
[1:42:03] when we are satisfied
[1:42:07] that's the place we set down
[1:42:09] and we relax
[1:42:12] and we start
[1:42:14] to ponder
[1:42:17] who am I
[1:42:19] that the Lord
[1:42:21] would bleed and die for absolutely
[1:42:25] who am I amen
[1:42:28] it's not my brother and sister all about
[1:42:30] I can quote out of this I can quote out
[1:42:32] of that I can do the timeline from my
[1:42:35] head I can tell you how it all is no my
[1:42:38] brother and sister some people are
[1:42:39] getting so far from the fact he bled and
[1:42:43] died for them
[1:42:45] while they can explain everything else
[1:42:48] they've missed
[1:42:50] the relationship
[1:42:52] of the father wrapping
[1:42:55] that garment around them
[1:42:59] oh
[1:43:00] how along
[1:43:03] for his arms
[1:43:05] around me
[1:43:06] the real hunger
[1:43:09] that we have
[1:43:11] my brother and sister
[1:43:13] there's a hunger for him
[1:43:17] it's only good for a day
[1:43:19] those who ate it were hungry again the
[1:43:21] next day
[1:43:22] but if it was left around it become
[1:43:24] contaminated I'll tell you what we've
[1:43:27] done we've thrown this message down in
[1:43:29] every place and every circumstance and
[1:43:31] whatever and then we wonder why it
[1:43:33] produced what It produced because it was
[1:43:36] an old Revelation that they left laying
[1:43:40] around and telling the church now look
[1:43:42] we're going to go back here we're going
[1:43:45] to go back here we're going to go back
[1:43:46] here we're going to go back here my
[1:43:49] brother and sister every day going by
[1:43:51] more contaminated I want to live right
[1:43:54] here in the fresh Manna of my day I want
[1:43:57] that fresh Manna to fall and sometimes
[1:44:00] that Manna hurts sometimes that Manna
[1:44:02] corrects us sometimes that Mana just
[1:44:04] doesn't seem to have that sweet taste in
[1:44:06] our mouth my brother and sister but it's
[1:44:08] God's provided word it's God's provided
[1:44:11] way where God is dealing and speaking
[1:44:13] with you and I
[1:44:15] amen left around it become contaminated
[1:44:18] amen but Jesus is the true bread from
[1:44:20] Heaven whereof Manna was just a type and
[1:44:24] if any man eats of that bread that came
[1:44:26] from Heaven he will never hunger again
[1:44:29] he does not need to come back and eat
[1:44:31] again the moment he partook he had
[1:44:35] eternal life oh I tell you isn't this
[1:44:37] beautiful now don't be mistaken my
[1:44:40] brother and sister that the yearning
[1:44:42] that you still have to be in the
[1:44:45] presence of God is not the hunger that
[1:44:48] the prophet is saying goes away amen
[1:44:51] that is a yearning that God put in your
[1:44:53] heart to not get us to a point that we
[1:44:56] just settle down and say we've made it
[1:44:59] we made it this is what it was all about
[1:45:00] we made it
[1:45:02] read about the organ Trail if you need
[1:45:04] the answers to that my brother and
[1:45:05] sister you read about the settlement of
[1:45:07] the West and I don't say this derogatory
[1:45:09] big country people needed to be
[1:45:11] everywhere but you read true history and
[1:45:13] there would be people that left crossed
[1:45:16] out of Independence Missouri started
[1:45:17] West and when they got tired of
[1:45:19] traveling they said this is far enough
[1:45:22] yeah and then there were others that
[1:45:24] went a little further and some fought
[1:45:27] with the Indians and were hungry and hot
[1:45:29] and cold everything and they said this
[1:45:31] is far enough and that settled all of
[1:45:33] that country but there were some that
[1:45:35] said we started out to go to Oregon and
[1:45:38] we are going to Oregon and we are going
[1:45:41] to make it we're going to the land that
[1:45:43] we profess we were going to and they
[1:45:46] never stop and don't stop when you just
[1:45:48] get to Idaho on the organ Trail you read
[1:45:50] about what it was like when they went
[1:45:52] down the Columbia Gorge how that they
[1:45:55] would be men they had to unload
[1:45:57] everything out of their wagons and they
[1:45:59] had to get together brother I need your
[1:46:01] help
[1:46:02] sister I need your help church I need
[1:46:05] your help
[1:46:07] because I can't pull my wagon up the
[1:46:10] bluff by myself
[1:46:13] and if you pray for me I'll pray for you
[1:46:17] if you'll be my friend encourage me I
[1:46:20] will be your friend and encourage you
[1:46:21] you see where the body of Fellowship
[1:46:23] comes together and they got down in the
[1:46:25] Columbia Gorge and the only way once
[1:46:27] they got that far down in the gorge was
[1:46:29] either turn back
[1:46:32] and hope they could find another way
[1:46:36] or to come together in Fellowship
[1:46:39] and put every drop of effort
[1:46:42] to drag every wagon empty
[1:46:46] up the bluffs
[1:46:47] to the top
[1:46:51] and then carry everything they owned
[1:46:53] they say in history there used to be a
[1:46:55] spot there in the Columbia Gorge where
[1:46:57] anything you needed
[1:46:59] to make a house you could find it right
[1:47:01] there
[1:47:02] because after people had carried this up
[1:47:05] the hill and got up the hill finally
[1:47:07] they looked at that and said honey
[1:47:09] that big old four poster bed of yours
[1:47:13] is gone
[1:47:15] because I'm not going down there and
[1:47:16] carrying that thing I'll chop a few
[1:47:19] trees down when we get over here and
[1:47:20] I'll make you a bed imagine what that
[1:47:22] was in comparison
[1:47:24] the carnal flesh said oh my denomination
[1:47:26] was way more comfortable and much
[1:47:29] prettier
[1:47:31] but we found a place of Rest In God's
[1:47:33] provided Place amen and you look at this
[1:47:37] my brother and sister I hope I'm even
[1:47:39] making sense to you you look at this my
[1:47:41] brother and sister it comes back see we
[1:47:44] have come we have had our hunger
[1:47:46] satisfied I don't I don't like to speak
[1:47:49] it this way but I'm going to tonight my
[1:47:52] brother and sister if you can find
[1:47:54] something better than the message I
[1:47:57] encourage you to go to it
[1:48:00] amen but when you've come here God has
[1:48:04] answered the question and satisfied the
[1:48:07] hunger of the soul and now we're here
[1:48:09] with a yearning to be in his presence
[1:48:11] The Love Letter being expressed is
[1:48:14] causing us to say this world is not my
[1:48:17] home this is not where I belong Lord I
[1:48:20] want to be in your presence
[1:48:22] but don't mistake that
[1:48:25] as the hunger that the scripture says
[1:48:28] he's satisfied
[1:48:30] see people are like there must be
[1:48:31] something more
[1:48:33] I hear it from people
[1:48:35] I hear from people there must be
[1:48:37] something more brother Paul we're
[1:48:39] missing something in the message no I'm
[1:48:41] sorry this might be a little Blunt
[1:48:42] You're missing something
[1:48:45] the believer of the message is not
[1:48:47] missing anything
[1:48:49] you're missing something instead of
[1:48:52] going out here the denomination instead
[1:48:54] of going back out here to the world to
[1:48:55] try and find what it is that you are
[1:48:58] missing get down and say Lord my
[1:49:01] father's house has everything I need
[1:49:04] Lord take me back to my father's house
