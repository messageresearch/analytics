[9:55] no grumbling, no murmuring.
[10:00] We say, "How do I control that?" You're
[10:02] in the great battle. Do you believe that
[10:03] tonight, sister? You need to be over

[10:30] word up in the battlefield. Amen. And
[10:33] you've won. We have a choice. Some God
[10:36] gave us the power of choice. Amen. So

[10:44] I don't know
[10:46] [Music]
[10:47] about tomorrow.
[10:51] I just live
[10:55] from day to day.
[10:59] I don't borrow
[11:02] from it sunshine.
[11:06] Forest skies
[11:09] may turn to gray.
[11:13] I don't worry
[11:16] or the future
[11:19] for I know
[11:22] what Jesus said.
[11:26] And today
[11:29] I'll walk beside him
[11:32] for he knows
[11:35] what is ahead.
[11:39] Many things
[11:42] about tomorrow
[11:45] I don't seem
[11:48] to understand.
[11:52] But I know
[11:55] who holds tomorrow.
[11:59] And I know
[12:02] who holds my hand.
[12:06] Every step
[12:08] is getting brighter. Thank the Lord. has

[12:39] will dim the eye
[12:43] at the ending
[12:46] of the rainbow
[12:49] where the mountains
[12:52] touch the sky.
[12:55] anything
[12:58] about tomorrow
[13:01] I don't seem
[13:03] to understand
[13:07] but I know hallelujah who holds tomorrow
[13:15] and I know
[13:17] who holds my hand
[13:22] I don't know
[13:25] about tomorrow.
[13:28] It may bring
[13:31] me poverty,
[13:34] but the one, think of it, who feeds the
[13:38] sparrow
[13:40] is the one who stands by me.
[13:47] And the path
[13:49] that be my portion
[13:53] may be through
[13:55] the flame or flood,
[13:59] but his prayer, think of it, goes before
[14:03] me. Hallelujah. And I'm covered
[14:08] with his blood. That's it. Many things
[14:13] hallelujah about tomorrow
[14:17] I don't seem
[14:20] to understand
[14:24] but I know
[14:27] who holds
[14:31] and I know
[14:34] who holds my hand.

[14:46] behind the wall. Stay behind his word.

[14:53] It's not for you to know how or when or
[14:55] how he's going to do it. He will do it
[14:58] because your absolute isn't your
[15:00] feelings. Isn't your senses, isn't your
[15:02] reasoning or others say or do. It's the
[15:05] word. Hallelujah. God help me not to
[15:08] minister. Amen.

[24:24] Let's stand together this evening.
[24:27] Have one request. Please pray for my son

[24:33] The markers in his blood for the cancer
[24:36] has doubled. Please pray for healing and
[24:39] God's will in his life. Thank you,
[24:42] Sister Sue.
[24:43] Amen. May God's perfect desire and will
[24:46] be done in that, brother. Amen. Amen. I
[24:49] know there's other requests, any
[24:50] unspoken requests. I know there's people
[24:53] online which we welcome tonight with all
[24:55] of our hearts. May God bless the word to
[24:58] your hearts. And I know there's those
[25:00] that we've been praying for, requested.
[25:02] You know who they are.
[25:05] Let's just go together in prayer. Our
[25:07] heavenly father, blessed be thy holy
[25:10] name.
[25:11] Thou art the redeemer. Thou art our
[25:14] salvation.
[25:16] There's nothing impossible. All things
[25:19] are possible to them that believe. All
[25:22] things. And Lord Jesus, you forgive us
[25:26] where we've aired. You forgive us for
[25:27] listening to our feelings, our reasoning
[25:30] of the enemy against the word. Lord,
[25:35] when you say it's so, it's so. When you
[25:37] said what you've done is done, is done.
[25:40] When you said, Lord, that we are free,
[25:42] we're free. And Lord Jesus, we just
[25:46] accept it on the battlefield. We place
[25:48] it against the power of the enemy. We
[25:51] stay behind the word that it's written.
[25:54] That's our stay. That's our comfort.
[25:56] That's our peace.
[25:58] We're expecting you to speak tonight,
[26:00] Lord. We're expecting you to minister
[26:02] your word in the power of faith, the
[26:06] power of the resurrection, the power of
[26:08] the Holy Spirit. We're expecting to
[26:10] leave here tonight raised to a higher
[26:12] plane. And Lord Jesus, we bring this
[26:15] need to you of our brother Dana. Lord
[26:19] God, he needs a release.
[26:23] He needs to repent. He needs to turn
[26:27] around and realize where he's at. And
[26:29] only you can do that. May you grant that
[26:32] to him. That's the first thing we ask.
[26:34] And then the next thing, Lord, may he
[26:36] realize, Lord, and accept healing for
[26:38] his body. But Father, may you deal with
[26:41] him in that soul realm. We do pray for
[26:44] deliverance. We pray for healing, Lord.
[26:47] But oh, Father, may you turn him around.
[26:52] God, I know that's the prayer of his
[26:54] mother. That's the prayer of the
[26:55] brothers and sisters. We love him,
[26:57] Father. We want to see him free. So may
[27:01] you fulfill your desire and perfect will
[27:03] through all of this to that point right
[27:06] there Lord that you would cause him to
[27:08] be desperate
[27:10] and Lord may he be set free from that
[27:13] cancer for your glory and honor we pray
[27:16] in these unspoken requests thou know us
[27:18] every one of them. You know our future.
[27:21] You know what the next moment holds. We
[27:23] do not but you do. And what a comfort it
[27:25] is to put our trust completely and
[27:28] totally in the promise. Lord, you're
[27:30] here to fulfill the promise. You're here
[27:33] in us to do that promise. Let us take a
[27:36] hold of the word and not turn, but give
[27:37] thanks and water it day by day. Lord,
[27:40] regardless of what happens the next
[27:42] moment, every breath is in your hands.
[27:45] You can turn the moment, you can turn it
[27:47] around. I've seen you do it so many
[27:49] times, Father, and I know you'll do it
[27:52] again and again. And the answer is even
[27:55] now on its way to and you have a perfect
[27:58] time to glorify and manifest yourself.
[28:01] This is what we expect to do because you
[28:03] made that as a promise to us your elect
[28:06] and it cannot fail.
[28:08] Lord for us to live as Christ and to die
[28:11] as gain.
[28:13] Oh Jesus may you guide the meditation
[28:18] Lord the the words of our mouth and the
[28:20] meditation of our heart from this moment
[28:22] forth. Let it be acceptable, Father. And
[28:25] Lord, we ask these things now and for
[28:27] your glory and honor. Remember those,
[28:29] Lord, that we've had requests for, many
[28:31] that unspoken, but Lord, you know what's
[28:35] in their hearts and what's on our
[28:36] hearts. And those listening in, may you
[28:38] bless the word to them in Jesus Christ's
[28:41] name. Amen.
[28:44] Amen.
[28:46] Amen. You may be seated.

[29:08] it to him.
[29:10] Brother Adam said in one place that
[29:12] that's all you need to do. Yeah. And
[29:14] remember what he said when he said when
[29:16] you say here am I Lord lead me guide me

[29:31] soul. Amen. Aren't you? He's not an
[29:33] author of frustration. He has a purpose

[29:37] through. Amen. Amen. I'm thankful for
[29:40] that. If the world from you withhold
[29:45] of its silver and its gold and you have
[29:50] to get along with meager f.

[30:01] feeds the little bird. Take your burden
[30:05] to the Lord and leave it there.

[30:15] Leave it there. He knows how to direct
[30:17] you. Take your burden, too. And he will

[30:31] surely bring you out. Take your burden
[30:35] to the Lord and leave it there.
[30:40] Oh, if your body suffers pain and your
[30:46] health you can't regain and your soul is
[30:50] almost sinking in despair.

[31:35] to the Lord and leave it there.
[31:41] Oh, when your enemy on the battlefield,
[31:45] your heart begins to fail. Don't forget
[31:50] that God always answers prayer.

[31:59] impossible. He'll lead you safely
[32:03] through. Take your burden to the Lord

[32:31] surely bring you out. Take your burden
[32:36] to the Lord and leave it there.
[32:41] Oh, when your youthful days are gone and
[32:46] old ages stealing on and your body bends
[32:51] beneath the weight of care,
[32:57] he will never leave you. Then he'll go
[33:01] with Oh, hallelujah.

[35:43] this thirsting
[35:45] of my soul.
[35:51] Bread of heaven.
[35:55] Feed me till I walk no more.
[36:03] Here's my cup.
[36:06] Fill it up and make me whole.
[36:14] We'll go the first verse again. Before I
[36:17] do this, I can never hear this song
[36:20] sung, and I know this may not mean a lot
[36:23] to you, but
[36:25] I can hear my mother singing it at full
[36:28] gospel businessmen's meetings back in
[36:31] Phoenix and many other songs she sang in
[36:34] churches. She had a beautiful soprano
[36:37] voice
[36:38] and I I I say that just it's just it's
[36:42] just like I'm hearing her all over
[36:43] again. She was truly hungry. And you
[36:46] know what? That's before they knew the
[36:48] message.
[36:50] But God satisfied it.
[36:53] Sing it again. Like the woman. You're
[36:55] like the woman. I'm like the woman at
[36:57] the well.
[37:00] There's nothing in the world satisfies.
[37:03] Nothing of treasures of this world,
[37:05] nothing of your human natural desires
[37:08] will satisfy.
[37:10] Only thing it satisfy is an opening of
[37:11] the word in that soul. Amen.
[37:15] Like the woman at the well, I was
[37:22] seeking
[37:25] things
[37:27] that could not satisfy.
[37:34] And then
[37:36] I heard my Savior speaking. That's what
[37:42] we expect tonight. Draw from my well
[37:47] that never shall run. Come.
[37:54] Fill my cup,
[37:57] Lord.
[37:59] I lift it up,
[38:03] Lord.
[38:06] Come and quench
[38:09] this thirsting
[38:11] of my soul.
[38:16] Bread of heaven,
[38:20] feed me till I want no more.
[38:28] Here's my cup. Fill it up and make me
[38:36] whole.
[38:39] You know, I've taken about 5 minutes of
[38:41] my brother's time. So, we'll give him
[38:44] five minutes more. I may say amen.
[38:48] Maybe longer than that if he so desires.
[38:52] God bless you.
[38:55] Amen. Let's just stand and sing that
[38:57] chorus again as we just go into the
[38:59] word. Amen. Just desire tonight, you
[39:03] know, sometimes I I think you would
[39:05] relate to this. Sometimes you just have
[39:07] a rough week and at the end of that week
[39:10] or sometimes it's a rough midweek. You
[39:14] just feel drained. You just feel like
[39:16] already it's like, "Oh, I've put out all
[39:19] the energy, all the effort, all the
[39:21] ability that I have." And truly, I think
[39:24] that is a a perfect song. Fill my cup.
[39:29] Amen.
[39:30] It's Paul.
[39:33] Amen. Oh, fill my cup,
[39:38] Lord.
[39:40] I lift it up,
[39:45] Lord.
[39:48] Come and quench
[39:52] this thirsting
[39:54] of my soul.
[40:00] Bread of heaven,
[40:03] [Music]
[40:04] feed me till I want no more.
[40:12] Here's my cup.
[40:15] Fill it up and make me whole.
[40:22] [Music]
[40:24] Amen. It's good to be here tonight. I
[40:27] was just sitting here just thinking uh
[40:30] during the song service right there and
[40:32] it just reminded me there's just a small
[40:35] group but remember brother Jason how he
[40:37] used to say this is family. Amen. And I
[40:41] just had to chuckle a little bit down in
[40:43] my spirit. It's like looks to me like
[40:45] the families come together to to eat
[40:48] together to uh fellowship to worship
[40:51] together tonight. And amen. You know, I
[40:54] have that quote uh in the in the office
[40:58] there that I'd rather preach to two
[41:00] people and be right in the eyes of the
[41:03] Lord. Amen. That's what we desire. And
[41:06] so, we're very happy to see each and
[41:08] every one of you, Sister Alice. Amen. Uh
[41:11] just um I know that sometimes public
[41:14] displays of affection are maybe not
[41:16] right, but I just I just love my my
[41:19] sister. She's just uh always been so
[41:22] sweet, so kind, so encouraging, and and
[41:26] uh so it's just so good to see you,
[41:29] Sister and Sister April. Little
[41:31] surprise, but your shift, however things
[41:33] are, we're happy you're here. And uh so
[41:36] happy to see each and every one of you.
[41:39] Now, let's just remember, you know, some
[41:40] of them just suffering through vacations
[41:43] and and you know, travels and stuff.
[41:46] Let's remember them in prayer also. Uh
[41:49] so I I want to speak to you on the
[41:52] thought of God's achievement uh tonight,
[41:55] a continuation of part four. Uh and um
[41:59] you know there are a lot of needs out
[42:01] here. I if you would just remember
[42:03] please uh um the young man that was with
[42:07] us on Sunday, Cody, I've known him since
[42:10] he was just a little child. Uh I had a
[42:13] lovely time by God's grace to visit with
[42:15] him and his mother, Lois. um come to the
[42:19] house. We sat and talked for oh
[42:21] something like two and a half hours. And
[42:24] uh and let's also remember the young
[42:26] ladies that had been coming and I
[42:29] believe they'll be back. Uh uh Megan and
[42:32] Aspen. Uh Amen. They've got a godly uh
[42:36] message believing grandmother that's
[42:38] behind them just praying and just
[42:40] witnessing to them. And then Sister
[42:43] Grace's friend uh Ethan, let's remember
[42:46] him also. You know, we're really blessed
[42:48] these young people. God is stirring. I
[42:51] was just talking to some different
[42:52] brothers, pastors, uh this last week and
[42:55] and uh people coming out of the woodwork
[42:58] uh and uh things happening and and uh
[43:01] you know, it's we see the season, right?
[43:04] We see everything. I'm just going to use
[43:06] the phrase the stars are all lining up
[43:09] and uh this this is the time. We see
[43:12] what's happening. We see how it's
[43:13] happening. And uh just to give you not
[43:16] politics here but to understand now the
[43:18] prophet says America's bankrupt and we
[43:22] just added 3 something trillion to the
[43:26] bankruptcy and think nothing of it.
[43:30] So it's there. They've already said that
[43:33] it would take six or seven generations
[43:36] being taxed to even make a dent.
[43:40] Just that simple prophecy. the prophet
[43:42] saying, "America is broke." Just a
[43:46] simple thing and we see it coming to
[43:49] pass. Amen. The signs are all around us.
[43:53] Lord, help us not to be blind, not to
[43:55] have our head in the sand, ignore it,
[43:58] just thinking it's another day, but God
[44:00] is gracious in mercy. Amen. Hallelujah.
[44:04] Uh let's turn our our Bibles. 1 Peter
[44:06] 2:7 through10. Thank you, Sister Ruth.
[44:10] Amen.
[44:12] um
[44:18] 1 Peter 2 chapter verses 7-10.
[44:23] Now tonight I just want to speak this
[44:25] because God's achievement. Now my
[44:28] brother and sister, there's a time and a
[44:30] place for for uh you might say the
[44:33] correction of the word, right? For for
[44:35] uh correction uh chastisement begins in
[44:39] the house of God. And so if we don't
[44:40] have it here, we're we're not going to,
[44:43] you might say, in a typical human
[44:45] fashion, self-judge oursel. We need the
[44:48] word to inspire us to judge oursel.
[44:52] Amen. And we'll look at this, but
[44:54] sometimes we just simply need encourage.
[44:56] Sometimes we just need, as it would be,
[44:58] the Lord would, so to speak, pat us on
[45:00] the back and say, "Here's my word. Just
[45:03] believe what my word." Brother David hit
[45:06] on that just a minute ago in his
[45:08] comments. Here's my word. Just believe
[45:10] it. Just trust it. This is what my plans
[45:14] for you are. I know my own plans. I
[45:17] wrote the book. Amen. And so don't don't
[45:20] worry about what this man says or what
[45:22] this group says or the negative around
[45:25] the group. Don't don't worry about what
[45:28] they're going to say. I wrote this book
[45:30] to you.
[45:32] If I didn't write it to them, then so be
[45:34] it. But I wrote it to you. So don't let
[45:37] their understanding of the book cause
[45:39] you to not understand the book. Trust
[45:43] the Lord. Unto you therefore which
[45:46] believe. Can we say that together?
[45:49] Believe.
[45:50] He is precious. But unto them which be
[45:53] disobedient, the stone which the
[45:55] builders disallowed, the same is made
[45:58] the head of the corner, and a stone of
[46:01] stumbling, and a rock of offense, even
[46:04] to them which stumble at the word, being
[46:07] disobedient, where to also they were
[46:11] appointed. Now, this is what caught me
[46:13] on this subject. So, let me just take
[46:15] one second here. when I was reading this
[46:18] scripture and it struck me and and I
[46:22] guess I've saw it before but it just
[46:24] struck me in such a fashion
[46:26] appointed.
[46:28] Amen. Amen. In other words, an
[46:31] appointment say like the government
[46:33] would be to be called and placed into a
[46:37] position.
[46:39] So my brother and sister, I want you to
[46:42] understand, and we'll read a quote here
[46:45] in just a few minutes, but they were
[46:47] appointed. Yes, sir. But so are you.
[46:50] That's right. Amen. But ye, here it is.
[46:54] But ye are a chosen generation, a royal
[46:57] priesthood, a holy nation, a peculiar
[47:00] people, that ye should show forth the
[47:02] praises of him who hath called you out
[47:05] of Leodysia.
[47:08] called you out of the 2025
[47:12] anointing in America. Amen. Been called
[47:15] out of that. Amen. So a pecure people
[47:18] that you show forth the praise of him
[47:20] whoath called you out of darkness into
[47:22] his marvelous light which in time past
[47:24] were not a people but are now the people
[47:28] of God which had not obtained mercy but
[47:31] now hallelujah have obtained mercy.
[47:35] Heavenly Father, we just thank you Lord.
[47:37] ask you to come speak to our hearts
[47:38] through your word tonight, Lord. Maybe
[47:41] in these troubled times, Lord, where
[47:43] there's pressure everywhere and hardly a
[47:46] place that we can go, Father, but in
[47:48] your presence. And Lord, sometimes even
[47:51] Satan follows us right in the house of
[47:53] God. And we find that we're thinking of
[47:56] problems and circumstances and not on
[47:59] the word. And Lord, we would just ask
[48:01] you this evening just to bind our
[48:02] thoughts to your word. Father, that we
[48:05] would just let the cares of life just
[48:07] go. Let our problems, our circumstances
[48:10] just go. That we could receive your word
[48:13] tonight. And Lord, that we could believe
[48:15] it and confess it. We ask for your
[48:18] guiding hand in the service, Lord, for
[48:20] those who are not here tonight. Uh
[48:22] circumstances unable to come, Lord. just
[48:25] ask you to deal kindly with each and
[48:28] every one for I will be blunt Lord that
[48:31] you would just place a greater burden in
[48:34] hearts to be in the house of God. Lord
[48:37] we love you and we thank you in the name
[48:38] of Jesus Christ. Amen. You may be
[48:41] seated. I just want to go right into
[48:44] this. Uh so as we look in the word we we
[48:47] see very clearly and I won't go through
[48:50] some of these scriptures. We'll just
[48:52] kind of preach them because you know the
[48:54] scripture. But we'll look at this and we
[48:56] see that the wheat and the tears always
[48:59] as the scripture says where the wheat is
[49:01] growing where it has been sown uh the
[49:04] tears will come. Amen. The that evil one
[49:08] had come and and he swed his seed also.
[49:11] So my brother and sister we can tonight
[49:14] we can focus on on the terrors. We can
[49:16] say look at this and look at that. But
[49:19] if we're wheat, let's look at wheat.
[49:22] Amen. If we are wheat, amen, we know
[49:24] that we weren't sown by the evil one.
[49:26] Amen. We weren't swn by that wicked one.
[49:29] We were swn by our Lord Jesus Christ.
[49:31] And so in that realm, you know, wherever
[49:34] the wheat is, that tears will be
[49:37] present. So we know that both have to be
[49:40] present. Amen. We're coming right down
[49:42] here into the end of the ages and we're
[49:45] seeing how that everything coming to
[49:47] maturity. You know the parable and they
[49:50] were thinking we'll go out and we will
[49:52] weed out the tears. But you know the
[49:55] word come and spoke to them and says
[49:57] don't do that because as it is while you
[50:00] are uprooting the tear you are going to
[50:04] damage the wheat. Now imagine that we as
[50:07] as believers would operate in such a
[50:10] fashion that when people would come in
[50:12] the house of God that that maybe their
[50:14] thoughts, their intents, their position
[50:16] in life wasn't quite right and you know
[50:19] we just had uh you know brothers just
[50:21] strongarm them and toss them out the
[50:23] door in the parking lot and we'd say
[50:26] well praise God we did this for the
[50:27] glory of God. But my brother and sister
[50:30] what would that do to everyone else? It
[50:33] would it would cause it that that it
[50:35] would not be a representation because
[50:37] the very next Sunday maybe we would
[50:39] preach on the love of God and it would
[50:41] look like what well we didn't show any
[50:43] love to anybody last week and now we're
[50:46] all overcome with love. See that's not
[50:49] how it is. You have to preach the love
[50:51] of Christ, the gospel, the word and you
[50:53] have to let these things come up
[50:55] together because oh my I'm sad to admit
[50:59] this. I've been wrong before on who was
[51:03] wheat and tear.
[51:06] Some that I thought were wheat that must
[51:08] be going to come forth as a hundfold
[51:11] don't even serve God today.
[51:14] And some I never thought there was a
[51:16] hope for them or on fire for God today.
[51:19] There's another reason why we don't run
[51:21] around rooting the tears out from
[51:24] amongst the weed. Because if we did, we
[51:26] would have to say we know God's mind.
[51:29] And while the word does say that we have
[51:32] the mind of Christ, he didn't open that
[51:35] for us. Amen. He reserved that for
[51:38] himself. Now, brother Brandham's
[51:40] speaking here out of the seventh church
[51:42] age, the Sardisian church age. Uh this
[51:44] will not be on the screen, but he's
[51:46] talking about how let it be noted that
[51:49] the choosing and it gives an exact
[51:51] parallel as the illustration of Moses
[51:53] and Pharaoh. So God's choosing, my
[51:56] brother and sister, has come down that
[51:58] that God chose Moses. Now remember, God
[52:01] come to Moses out there on the backside
[52:02] of the desert and said, "This is what I
[52:05] want you to do." He uses a burning bush
[52:07] that is not consumed, which would be a
[52:10] type of the Holy Ghost. Amen. It doesn't
[52:12] burn for a season and burn out. Amen. It
[52:15] is there with us uh as sons and
[52:18] daughters of God. It just goes on. The
[52:20] Holy Ghost doesn't run out. It's not
[52:22] going to come down that the rapture day
[52:24] is decided because the o Holy Ghost, the
[52:27] oil has run out on that day. No, my
[52:30] brother and sister. So, here's Moses
[52:32] chose on a backside of the desert and
[52:34] here's Pharaoh living in a king's palace
[52:36] and God chose each one of those for that
[52:38] position. Amen. So, as it is that Moses
[52:41] had to have a Pharaoh and we see that
[52:44] Jacob had to have an Esau and Jesus had
[52:48] to have a Judas. Amen. So the choosing
[52:52] of that now I'll read this line here
[52:54] right out of this quote. For though Esau
[52:57] and Pharaoh were both fornown they were
[53:01] predestinated to wrath while the end of
[53:04] Moses and Jacob was glorification.
[53:08] See how that God is moving and and we
[53:10] don't want to sound judgmental like we
[53:12] would look out and say I don't think
[53:13] these people will and I I think those
[53:16] will. No, we're here uh as it is
[53:18] ministers preach the gospel as sons and
[53:21] daughters of God. Let us be living
[53:24] written epistles read of all men. Amen.
[53:27] That's our job is just to live the
[53:29] gospel. And what God has put in store
[53:33] for them will come to pass. Amen. Just
[53:37] as I brought that up, the prophet of God
[53:39] said, "America's broke." Now, my brother
[53:41] and sister, they're doing all this.
[53:43] We've saved uh we went here and saved
[53:45] all this money and we've saved all this
[53:47] money and we did all this and we did
[53:50] that because we actually want to blow it
[53:51] on our own program. So, you know, it
[53:55] doesn't matter. People are saying, "Oh,
[53:56] this is evil." But my brother and
[53:58] sister, this is for ordained. Yes. So,
[54:01] don't look at it like it was a Mr. Trump
[54:05] or this particular Congress. This is for
[54:08] ordained. And so while a bride is
[54:11] storing up riches in heaven, there has
[54:15] to be the counter type that is here,
[54:18] amen, that are spending themselves, you
[54:21] might say, into oblivion. And they're
[54:23] trying to create heaven on earth, but we
[54:25] know our treasure is laid up. Amen. We
[54:28] don't have to look at this world and
[54:30] worry about world economies because our
[54:32] treasure's already been laid up. And now
[54:35] they go on and and say here, you know,
[54:38] brother Brandham goes, see, they were
[54:39] appointed. Amen. They were appointed to
[54:42] that position. Now, the reason I want to
[54:45] make emphasis to this, I think tonight
[54:48] at uh even with our small congregation
[54:51] or turnout tonight, uh it doesn't matter
[54:53] because we're sitting here and I believe
[54:55] I can speak with this kind of confidence
[54:57] that you were appointed. You were
[54:59] appointed. You were appointed. You were
[55:02] appointed. Appointed. Appointed.
[55:03] appointed. Appointed. Appointed. Amen.
[55:06] This was God's decision. It's not
[55:08] something I'm trying to do or you're
[55:10] trying to do or I feel unworthy. I I
[55:13] feel like I failed and I just I just
[55:16] ought to quit. But you can't quit
[55:17] because you were appointed to finish the
[55:20] race. Amen. And as you were appointed,
[55:22] so shall you be. Amen. And that's the
[55:26] thing. So, we realize sometimes, and I
[55:28] know I'm probably the only one in this
[55:30] room that just feels like sometimes my
[55:32] life is an utter failure. I'm sure you
[55:34] guys don't deal with that. But my
[55:36] brother and sister, what God wants to
[55:38] remind us tonight is his appointment was
[55:41] a lifetime, eternal appointment. It
[55:44] didn't have an expiration date on it. It
[55:46] wasn't like I point you to this time.
[55:48] But my brother and sister, the fact he
[55:50] chose you and I to this day, this age,
[55:54] this time to the opening of the word, to
[55:57] the manifestation of a living word in
[55:59] this day shows that God has put in the
[56:02] plan the full victory for the bride of
[56:05] Jesus Christ. She She's not going to
[56:08] just come and have a partial victory.
[56:11] She's going to have a complete victory.
[56:13] Now, I say tonight, let's lift our hands
[56:15] and claim a complete victory. Amen.
[56:17] Lord, I want my cup filled tonight. That
[56:20] was so beautiful, the song. Amen. Not a
[56:23] partial victory, a full victory
[56:26] overcoming our enemy. Amen. The giant of
[56:30] the land. And it's there, my brother and
[56:32] sister, that we've already been
[56:33] appointed to that. Now, it would have
[56:36] been in doubt uh in many people's minds
[56:39] uh when David was going down there. You
[56:41] know, Saul says, "Put on my armor. My
[56:44] armor is a proven armor. It's a
[56:46] warrior's armor. But when David put that
[56:49] armor on, you know, we've seen many or
[56:51] heard many uh sermons preached on this,
[56:53] but imagine now you're trying to drag
[56:56] your denominational
[56:58] uh uh uh well-being, your denominational
[57:01] guard, your gu denominational armor. And
[57:04] it's actually too big for the believer.
[57:08] Believe it. It's too big for the
[57:10] believer, but not too big in the fashion
[57:13] our mind would think. It's too big
[57:15] because it's cumbered with this idea and
[57:18] that idea and this creed and this deal
[57:21] here and that deal there and there was
[57:23] no way. And once David, Amen, broke free
[57:26] of that. When he went down there,
[57:28] everybody's like, "Man, we're going to
[57:29] watch this little guy get slaughtered
[57:31] here." But you know what? David went
[57:33] down there when he picked up those
[57:35] stones. Imagine, I mean, I know you've
[57:37] thought of this, but it just strikes my
[57:39] heart. He's looking there in the stream
[57:41] bed and it wasn't just I grabbed the
[57:44] first five stones. He was anointed of
[57:46] God to pick up specific stones.
[57:52] And what he might not have understood
[57:54] and God may or may not have revealed to
[57:56] him, but every one of those stones had a
[58:00] spiritual significance in the eyes of
[58:03] God. And so that very first stone that
[58:06] David put in there, Amen. And I've heard
[58:08] it preached and I kind of embraced that
[58:10] a little bit. That first stone he put in
[58:12] there was faith. Amen. And he put that
[58:15] stone of faith in there. And when he
[58:17] sent faith to the enemy, the enemy was
[58:20] defeated. Amen. It wasn't intellectual.
[58:23] It wasn't a a stone of knowledge. It
[58:25] wasn't a stone of I belong to this
[58:28] church. It wasn't a stone I've been a
[58:29] Christian for 50 years. It was faith in
[58:32] what God was calling him to do. And he
[58:35] didn't even have to take the other four
[58:37] stones to defeat the enemy because faith
[58:40] is what we have been given by revelation
[58:43] to overcome. Amen. It is the key to the
[58:46] word. And so as it's there, we'll see
[58:49] how it is. And so we recognize how we
[58:52] have been appointed. Amen. We need to be
[58:55] very careful what we pick up. You know,
[58:57] often times you can take scripture and
[59:00] fight scripture with scripture. You can
[59:03] fight quote with quote, but we'll find
[59:06] when that starts to happen,
[59:10] we're not fighting God's fight. We're
[59:13] fighting man's fight. That's right.
[59:16] God's fight said only believe.
[59:20] So, I'm sorry this sounds a little
[59:22] little direct, but I'm slowly moving
[59:25] into this position in my life. I'm
[59:27] sorry. I'm not here to defend it. If you
[59:29] don't believe this is true,
[59:32] I I'm not even going to argue with you.
[59:34] God bless you. But I will say I'm
[59:37] confident enough where I stand that when
[59:39] you find out your idea is not
[59:41] sufficient. Feel free to come back.
[59:44] Amen. Feel feel liberty to come back.
[59:48] Because you see the revealed word is not
[59:50] here to fight another believer. Amen.
[59:54] It's not flesh and blood. Amen.
[59:57] principalities and powers of darkness.
[59:59] But how do we fight the darkness? What
[1:00:01] did the prophet of God laid it out so
[1:00:03] clear to us? How do we fight the
[1:00:05] darkness?
[1:00:08] Prayer.
[1:00:12] God answers prayer.
[1:00:18] So as we look at this, let me go on uh
[1:00:20] uh taking 1 Peter 2 8 and 9. We just
[1:00:24] read them, but I want to do see to some
[1:00:26] it's a stone of stumbling and a rock of
[1:00:29] offense even to them which stumble at
[1:00:32] the word. Amen. Now my brother and
[1:00:35] sister, let me tell you such an
[1:00:38] important ingredient. When the prophet
[1:00:40] of God talks about the bride, I'm
[1:00:43] paraphrasing this. The bride will say
[1:00:46] amen to every word of God. She's not
[1:00:50] going to stumble over it. She's going to
[1:00:53] say, "I might not understand this, but I
[1:00:55] say amen to it." Because the word is not
[1:00:58] our stone to stumble over.
[1:01:03] It might be theirs, but it's not. Amen.
[1:01:06] And the reason is is there's a
[1:01:07] disobedient spirit connected with it.
[1:01:10] The reason that they usually fight
[1:01:12] against the word is because the word is
[1:01:15] too hard for them to handle instead of
[1:01:19] saying, "I was wrong." Have you ever
[1:01:22] noticed the longer you go from point A,
[1:01:28] how do you word this poem? Yeah,
[1:01:30] straightforward.
[1:01:33] Fight with the wife. The longer you go
[1:01:36] from point A,
[1:01:39] I should be gracious to myself. The wife
[1:01:41] fights with me.
[1:01:43] Anyway,
[1:01:45] we don't want to be nitpicky, but have
[1:01:47] you ever noticed the farther we go from
[1:01:49] point A, the harder it is to repent and
[1:01:54] apologize.
[1:01:56] That's why the prophet said, "The minute
[1:01:58] the Holy Spirit deals with you," That's
[1:02:00] right. Take care of that. That's right.
[1:02:03] And so, we see how what God's doing. You
[1:02:05] know what he's actually doing? We say,
[1:02:06] "Well, he's he's causing us to repent.
[1:02:09] He's tenderizing us before a hard spirit
[1:02:14] settles in on us. He tenderizes us
[1:02:17] because we say, "Lord, you're right." I
[1:02:20] say, "Amen to the prophet's words of how
[1:02:24] we go about repenting." And yet, we
[1:02:27] still as humans sometimes struggle and
[1:02:29] we linger over it. And if we're not
[1:02:31] careful, we come to a new state of
[1:02:34] justification.
[1:02:37] I said what I said. I did what I did,
[1:02:39] but it was their fault.
[1:02:41] No, no, no. Let's not go to a new state
[1:02:44] of justification. Let's go to a present
[1:02:48] state of a repentant spirit, a tender
[1:02:51] spirit. Amen. A new chute. The scripture
[1:02:53] talks about that. The new chute growing
[1:02:56] forth tender. That's what we want to be.
[1:02:59] Amen. So, as you look at that seed
[1:03:01] there, there's this stone of stumbling.
[1:03:03] There's identifying a group. But as we
[1:03:06] come back, kind of redundant here,
[1:03:07] forgive me. But when you recognize that
[1:03:09] you are a chosen generation, and
[1:03:12] according to the word of God, we would
[1:03:14] be in the time or the season of the last
[1:03:17] generation. But I I don't want to change
[1:03:19] the word, but you know, you were chosen
[1:03:22] to be in the last generation. Amen. A
[1:03:26] royal priesthood, not just a people
[1:03:28] attending church, a holy nation. This is
[1:03:31] God blessing it as a people. peculiar
[1:03:34] people. The prophet of God says that
[1:03:36] that's not to be weird or awkward, but
[1:03:39] it's just to be that you are peculiar
[1:03:41] because you care more about the word
[1:03:44] than the average human would. You care
[1:03:46] about more about the word than the
[1:03:48] spirits of the age. You care more about
[1:03:51] your position of pleasing God than you
[1:03:54] do about pleasing man. Yes. So this is
[1:03:56] this is really what God, you know, and I
[1:03:59] I have that title, God's achievement. My
[1:04:01] brother and sister, if we really stop
[1:04:03] and look at it, we will see that this is
[1:04:06] none other than the Holy Spirit making
[1:04:09] you be who you are. Amen. Cuz otherwise
[1:04:12] we would just be good whatever. You can
[1:04:15] put the church in there. We would just
[1:04:16] be we would be the most dedicated and
[1:04:19] sincere people out here in these other
[1:04:22] churches. But God says, "You were chosen
[1:04:24] to fulfill to the fullest extent my word
[1:04:28] for the age, for this season, for this
[1:04:31] time. You were chosen for that." And he
[1:04:33] says, "So this is what I'm going to call
[1:04:35] you." Think about this. He's going to
[1:04:37] call you royal. Amen. See, it's not just
[1:04:39] about priesthood, but royal. Amen. A
[1:04:43] holy, not a nation, but a holy nation.
[1:04:47] Amen. and a people very peculiar because
[1:04:50] you put the things of God first. You
[1:04:52] would show forth the praises of him who
[1:04:55] hath called you out of darkness into his
[1:04:57] marvelous light. Just think about the
[1:05:00] days of old when the kings and they had
[1:05:02] their courts. Amen. Many a person uh
[1:05:06] take it back to the book of Esther as it
[1:05:08] were. Many a person come into the forier
[1:05:11] to see the king but he never lifted the
[1:05:14] scepter to them.
[1:05:19] Now I want you to put yourself in the
[1:05:20] place of east of Esther.
[1:05:26] We are the ERS of this generation
[1:05:29] that he has lifted the scepter.
[1:05:32] And not only has he lifted the scepter,
[1:05:35] he's come and says, I give to you even
[1:05:37] to the half of my kingdom.
[1:05:41] Talk about putting us in a position to
[1:05:45] call ourselves royal.
[1:05:47] Amen. To claim that position. See, this
[1:05:49] is what God's achieved. He's took us
[1:05:52] mere mortals and he's brought us to a
[1:05:54] place that he's inviting us into his
[1:05:57] very presence and saying, "I give to you
[1:06:00] the half of my kingdom. I give to you to
[1:06:02] sit in my throne with me." Amen. Not on
[1:06:06] the side, not down below, not behind,
[1:06:08] not out there, but to be in the throne
[1:06:11] with him. Amen. What a beautiful
[1:06:13] position that God has done. And he
[1:06:16] achieved that in spite of ourselves, in
[1:06:19] spite of our flesh, in spite of what
[1:06:21] what we think and how we were raised and
[1:06:23] whatever our reason is. My brother and
[1:06:26] sister, you know, it always reminds me
[1:06:28] people say, "Well, if if uh if we had
[1:06:30] the advantage like this person does and
[1:06:33] that person does, and then in the
[1:06:35] natural, which he is a Christian, but
[1:06:37] remember Ben Carson, the doctor." Amen.
[1:06:40] You know, he he grew up in in the
[1:06:42] ghettos. He grew up in a a a single
[1:06:44] mother. He grew up in the worst of
[1:06:47] conditions. And something in him, he
[1:06:49] said, "Someday, this is what I'm going
[1:06:51] to be." And he pressed himself to do
[1:06:54] that in a natural realm. And then he
[1:06:56] even has his testimony about how the
[1:06:59] Lord come to him. And he gave his heart
[1:07:01] to the Lord and and all that he
[1:07:03] accomplished to to be a oh, I don't know
[1:07:07] what the right word is to to be an
[1:07:09] incredible man. Amen. and his
[1:07:12] background,
[1:07:13] he says, was an advantage to him. Yeah.
[1:07:17] Because it motivated him not to stay
[1:07:19] where he was at. Now, I want us to
[1:07:22] spiritually think about this. We were
[1:07:24] born in sin, shaped in iniquity, coming
[1:07:26] to this world, speaking lies. We had all
[1:07:28] kinds of issues. And God is not going to
[1:07:31] give us an excuse to say, "Woe unto me."
[1:07:33] But we're going to look back and say,
[1:07:35] "Praise God, I am not what I used to
[1:07:38] be." Amen. I'm a new creature in Christ
[1:07:42] Jesus. I've been raised up as a royal
[1:07:45] priest. Amen. And I'm coming and I'm
[1:07:47] going to live to my calling when I was
[1:07:50] appointed.
[1:07:52] Amen.
[1:07:54] See, there's no exception to this
[1:07:56] principle even into this day. There's
[1:07:58] those that walk in darkness and are
[1:08:00] stumbling. And there's those who were
[1:08:02] called out of darkness. Amen. Some
[1:08:05] people would say, "You're judging."
[1:08:07] Well, get out of the dark then. If you
[1:08:10] feel judged, get out of the dark. Don't
[1:08:12] walk in the dark. If if you feel judged
[1:08:14] to be said you're walking in darkness,
[1:08:16] then get out of the darkness. Amen.
[1:08:20] Don't continue to walk in it and say,
[1:08:21] don't judge me.
[1:08:26] Now, in the message, I am the
[1:08:28] resurrection and the life, uh, brother
[1:08:31] Brandham says this, everything God has
[1:08:34] done, the devil made a substitute for
[1:08:38] it.
[1:08:39] Now, we don't think about this or I
[1:08:42] don't in most cases there's even a
[1:08:45] substitute Holy Ghost.
[1:08:49] That's how subtle Satan is. He created
[1:08:51] even a substitute
[1:08:54] Holy Ghost. I went to church. I felt
[1:08:58] shivers.
[1:09:01] I got emotional.
[1:09:03] All of this happened and that happened.
[1:09:04] I Oh, but you see my brother and sister,
[1:09:07] I I the Holy Ghost is pointing us in the
[1:09:11] right direction. The Holy Ghost is not
[1:09:14] going to anoint us to just continue to
[1:09:16] walk in darkness.
[1:09:18] It draws us,
[1:09:21] you know, like Epsom salts or whatever.
[1:09:24] you get a a a sliver or you have a
[1:09:27] little infection, you have a little
[1:09:29] something, you know, um you get uh
[1:09:32] whether you wrap it around your hand,
[1:09:34] your foot, your leg, or you're in a
[1:09:37] bath. The Epsom salts doesn't say,
[1:09:39] "Okay, I'm going to take you to a
[1:09:41] certain page and show you how to do
[1:09:43] this." And after a while, you know, this
[1:09:46] poisoness will be drawn out of your
[1:09:48] finger. No, the Epsom salts when it's
[1:09:51] applied starts drawing
[1:09:54] Immediately
[1:09:56] the Holy Ghost when it's applied starts
[1:09:59] drawing us out of darkness immediately.
[1:10:03] I think we all can testify of that.
[1:10:06] Amen. How the Lord comes to us, meets us
[1:10:08] wherever we're at and starts to draw us.
[1:10:12] Amen. That's the reason the two spirits
[1:10:14] in the last day come right along to be
[1:10:16] formed and fundamental. They miss the
[1:10:18] spirit altogether. You see like that.
[1:10:21] And some of these on the radical side go
[1:10:24] plum off into isms with it. But right in
[1:10:27] the middle of the road runs the true
[1:10:29] church of God standing in and full of
[1:10:32] the power of God. That's where it's at.
[1:10:35] Now certainly everything that God has,
[1:10:38] Satan has something to counterfeit it.
[1:10:41] See, he makes something out of it. And
[1:10:43] Jesus did perceive their thoughts. So
[1:10:46] therefore, the great Orthodox of those
[1:10:48] days said, "That guy is the best fortune
[1:10:52] teller in the country." Amen. Isn't that
[1:10:56] awesome? Here he is. He's discerning the
[1:10:59] very thoughts and intents of their
[1:11:00] heart. And the best conclusion that we
[1:11:03] can come as educated preachers of the
[1:11:06] message is to say that he's a good
[1:11:09] fortune teller.
[1:11:14] Yeah, he's be elabel, the prince of the
[1:11:17] devil. Is that right? Now, that's what
[1:11:20] the preachers said.
[1:11:25] My I'm sure glad I'm not really a
[1:11:28] preacher. I'm just
[1:11:30] a uh carrying the word. I I'm just as it
[1:11:35] would be a messenger boy. Amen. That's
[1:11:38] all I am. I don't want to be classified
[1:11:41] preacher if I have to be identified with
[1:11:44] this. Do you follow me? Amen. It's not
[1:11:48] just to take a position, right? But it's
[1:11:51] to have something of truth to say. Let's
[1:11:55] go on. And the great Bible teachers of
[1:11:57] that day said, "He's be elabub." Now,
[1:12:00] let's see what the devil said. I love
[1:12:02] this quote. Amen. The devil said he's
[1:12:06] the son of God. So we got all the
[1:12:08] preachers over here saying this is the
[1:12:10] devil and the devil's over here saying
[1:12:13] this is God. Amen. So the devil
[1:12:18] we know who you are the holy one of God.
[1:12:20] Ain't that right? And the case the
[1:12:22] devils had more knowledge of God than
[1:12:24] the ministry did. Is that right? And
[1:12:26] when Paul and Silas was up there and
[1:12:28] they were doing some great works for
[1:12:30] God, there was a little old fortune
[1:12:32] teller run out down the street every day
[1:12:34] and cried behind Paul and said, "These
[1:12:37] there's the men that tell us the way of
[1:12:39] life, the men of God." And here was the
[1:12:42] preacher said, "They're imposters. They
[1:12:44] turn the world upside down. They're no
[1:12:46] good." And that's what the ministry
[1:12:48] saying. They're imposters. And the
[1:12:49] devil's saying they're men of God.
[1:12:52] Now, my brother and sister, if we ever
[1:12:54] saw that take place in scripture, and we
[1:12:57] are repeating the days, this ministry in
[1:13:01] this world that we're living in today.
[1:13:04] Now, I I probably shouldn't even go
[1:13:06] there, but you know, I received another
[1:13:08] invitation. Uh I I I just continue to
[1:13:12] let them send it because it's kind of
[1:13:14] interesting to read them. and a certain
[1:13:16] church here in town, the Nampa
[1:13:19] Ministerial Association, is meeting
[1:13:21] there and they're thanking
[1:13:24] the pastor of the church for allowing
[1:13:26] them to hold it there, saying what a
[1:13:28] great minister she is.
[1:13:32] And then they wonder why I don't want to
[1:13:34] come and be part of it.
[1:13:37] One, because a prophet already warned us
[1:13:40] that this is where the ministerial
[1:13:42] associations were headed.
[1:13:45] And two, we believe it's against the
[1:13:47] word, right? So, you know what what God
[1:13:51] is saying and and uh and what you know
[1:13:54] what the ministry is saying and the
[1:13:56] devil's saying it's so interesting. Uh
[1:13:59] they're imposters. The devil's saying
[1:14:01] they're men of God. Which was right?
[1:14:03] See, the devil was right. See, every
[1:14:05] once in a while, Satan gets something
[1:14:07] right. Amen. Is that right? Sure he was.
[1:14:11] So you see even them people you can get
[1:14:13] so much on the word you think oh the
[1:14:16] word the word that's right but the
[1:14:19] gospel come not in word only but through
[1:14:22] power and demonstration of the holy
[1:14:25] spirit amen not just a spirit but power
[1:14:29] and demonstration of the holy spirit
[1:14:31] that's what's changing our life there is
[1:14:34] the sign of god's achievement in our
[1:14:38] life is that our life is being changed
[1:14:40] changed and guided and fulfilled by the
[1:14:43] Holy Spirit. Not intellectual
[1:14:46] understanding, not the quotes, just
[1:14:48] quotes, not just scripture, but the Holy
[1:14:51] Spirit giving uncction to us. And this
[1:14:54] is a crux of what you might say the
[1:14:56] prophet was saying, read between the
[1:14:58] lines. It's not just what's on the page,
[1:15:00] my brother and sister. The page has got
[1:15:02] to speak. The page has got to be real.
[1:15:05] It's got to be alive to us. Otherwise,
[1:15:08] we are just quoting. Right. And we can
[1:15:12] quote Shakespeare and not have a clue.
[1:15:14] That's right.
[1:15:16] Yeah. That's right.
[1:15:18] But the gospel came not in word only,
[1:15:20] but through the power and demonstration
[1:15:21] of the Holy Spirit until the word is
[1:15:25] made life.
[1:15:27] I love that. That stirs my heart because
[1:15:30] you see, it's not just we preach the
[1:15:33] word, we preach the word. If the word
[1:15:35] never becomes life, we have somehow
[1:15:38] missed the point. Amen. And we want the
[1:15:41] word to be life because we were called
[1:15:44] to walk in the light. Amen. And John 1
[1:15:47] covered it very well. Like a big
[1:15:50] blanket. Amen. That was the life. And
[1:15:54] the life was the light of men. Amen.
[1:15:56] There it is coming to life to you and I.
[1:15:59] Amen. Isn't this beautiful how God is
[1:16:01] achieving his word? Amen. And we we
[1:16:05] don't go out and say mark it off. Oh,
[1:16:06] God achieved another one. God achieved
[1:16:09] another one where it's being marked off
[1:16:12] as we find oursself changing
[1:16:16] into the word. We find ourselves coming
[1:16:19] to the place that that the only place we
[1:16:22] want to check is our life to see if it
[1:16:24] matches. Amen. It's not like, oh, I've
[1:16:28] done that. I've done that. I've done
[1:16:30] that. But Lord, is my life lining up?
[1:16:34] Lord, is my life lining up? Lord is my
[1:16:36] life lining up. and we start to check in
[1:16:40] a different fashion,
[1:16:42] you know. Uh um I was I was watching a
[1:16:45] little uh video thing uh about uh cars.
[1:16:49] Uh, the check engine light keeps coming
[1:16:51] on and off on our car and I was looking
[1:16:53] on a little deal and um, one mechanic
[1:16:59] says when your check engine light comes
[1:17:01] on, it came on for a reason and it's not
[1:17:04] telling you check the muffler,
[1:17:08] check the engine.
[1:17:11] Another mechanic comes on and says the
[1:17:12] light goes on and off. It's lying to
[1:17:14] you. Ignore it.
[1:17:18] Which one do we want to believe? God
[1:17:21] says, "Check your life." When the check
[1:17:23] life light comes on, Amen. We're walking
[1:17:27] in light and it says, "Check the light."
[1:17:30] And we check the light and realize,
[1:17:31] "Lord, I want to change to match the
[1:17:34] light." Amen. I don't want it going on
[1:17:36] and off. I don't want to assume that
[1:17:38] just cuz it was on at one time, I can
[1:17:41] just continue to live drive through my
[1:17:43] life without stopping and checking my
[1:17:47] life.
[1:17:48] Amen. And some would say once saved,
[1:17:50] always saved.
[1:17:52] And there's truth there. But you see,
[1:17:56] they're looking at it. I once made a
[1:17:59] commitment and so now I don't have to
[1:18:02] worry about it ever again. I don't have
[1:18:04] to live anything. I don't have to
[1:18:05] confess anything. I don't need to do
[1:18:08] anything because I did it once. And
[1:18:11] God's saying, "I want you to check." How
[1:18:13] often did the prophet tell us to check
[1:18:15] our life?
[1:18:17] daily.
[1:18:19] Amen. So, the check life light comes on
[1:18:23] daily. Lord, help us do not ignore it.
[1:18:26] Amen. Like that one mechanic, it's just
[1:18:28] lying to you. Just ignore it. The other
[1:18:31] guy is like, I like that. It didn't tell
[1:18:33] you to check your muffler.
[1:18:36] It told you to check your engine. Amen.
[1:18:39] Lord's not telling us to check this or
[1:18:41] check that. He's telling us to check our
[1:18:42] life out. Amen. Thank the Lord for that.
[1:18:45] Isn't that beautiful? Amen. And so we
[1:18:48] look at this the word. I I believe we
[1:18:51] can confess this tonight. Good times,
[1:18:53] bad times, struggles, whatever your day,
[1:18:56] week, month, maybe even this whole year
[1:18:58] has been a giant struggle. But my
[1:19:00] brother and sister, I I think we can say
[1:19:03] tonight the word has been made life to
[1:19:07] us. We're not serving a dead letter.
[1:19:10] We're not serving something that is we
[1:19:12] look back in time, you know, and say,
[1:19:15] "Well, well, God once did this, my
[1:19:18] brother and sister. I want to know what
[1:19:19] God did today." Amen. And I'll tell you
[1:19:22] what he did today. In spite of the kind
[1:19:24] of day that you might have had today,
[1:19:26] Amen. He was right there supporting you
[1:19:29] in the onslaught of Satan. Amen. That
[1:19:32] roaring lion was standing right there on
[1:19:34] your doorstep desiring to consume you.
[1:19:38] Amen. And he has come as a flaming
[1:19:41] sword. And that angel has been there.
[1:19:44] And the lion, Amen. Not the lion of the
[1:19:46] tribe of Judah, but the lion of
[1:19:48] destruction. And he he gets turned away
[1:19:51] by the word. And what is that? Because
[1:19:53] the word has been made life to you. And
[1:19:56] so it's there that we realize, look at
[1:19:58] the achievement God has done in our
[1:20:00] lives. What he's doing. In 1 Corinthians
[1:20:03] 2:9-12,
[1:20:06] but as it is written, I hath not seen
[1:20:09] nor ear heard, neither hath entered into
[1:20:11] the heart of man the things which God
[1:20:13] hath prepared for them that love him.
[1:20:16] Amen. We love the Lord. Hallelujah. But
[1:20:20] God hath revealed them unto us by his
[1:20:24] spirit. For the Spirit searchth all
[1:20:27] things, yay, the deep things of God.
[1:20:30] Amen.
[1:20:31] This is not a superficial message. This
[1:20:34] is not a superficial feeling. This is
[1:20:37] the deep things of God. Amen. And so the
[1:20:42] things of God, my brother and sister,
[1:20:44] for what man knoweth the things of a
[1:20:46] man, save the spirit of a man which is
[1:20:48] in him? Even so the things of God
[1:20:50] knoweth no man but the spirit of God.
[1:20:53] Now I want to put this to you like this.
[1:20:56] If you have understanding, revelation of
[1:20:59] the word of the hour, my brother and
[1:21:01] sister, that's nothing short of God
[1:21:04] coming. And if I could envision it this
[1:21:06] way to whoever here on the front row,
[1:21:08] amen, God coming and saying, "Here's my
[1:21:11] gift." Amen. Here's my gift of
[1:21:14] understanding. Here's my gift to you.
[1:21:17] Amen. If we could see it as though he
[1:21:19] was standing right here and not look at
[1:21:22] it in the abstract, but look at it in
[1:21:23] the literal. He has come and literally
[1:21:26] gave us a gift.
[1:21:29] Oh, not something to just say, "Oh,
[1:21:31] thanks.
[1:21:33] I'll I'll look into it later."
[1:21:36] My brother and sister, he wants us to
[1:21:38] unwrap the gift. He wants us to say,
[1:21:41] "Thank you for the gift." And then
[1:21:42] whatever that gift might be in your
[1:21:44] life, he wants you to take the gift and
[1:21:47] use it. Amen. Yeah.
[1:21:50] Cuz
[1:21:52] you know what happens to gifts? Whether
[1:21:55] they be birthday,
[1:21:58] holiday season, whatever it is, gifts
[1:22:00] that are never used, you know what
[1:22:02] happens to them?
[1:22:04] They get given to someone else. And we
[1:22:07] won't ask anybody who's guilty of
[1:22:09] regifting.
[1:22:11] You know, it's like,
[1:22:13] okay, you know, I think they would like
[1:22:17] this pink polkadotted shirt better. Here
[1:22:22] you go.
[1:22:24] That happened. Actually, let me share
[1:22:25] something real quick. So, when I was a
[1:22:27] kid, I won't go into all the details,
[1:22:28] but there was a young lady that really
[1:22:30] liked me, and her mother liked me more
[1:22:32] than the young lady liked me. And uh so,
[1:22:35] she made a shirt, and she was a very
[1:22:38] good seamstress. She made a shirt for me
[1:22:40] that was a westernstyle shirt. Do I look
[1:22:42] western?
[1:22:45] Um anyway, my cowboy slippers. Uh you
[1:22:48] know what? Um anyway, this shirt hung
[1:22:52] around for a long time. Jerry and I are
[1:22:55] married
[1:22:57] and um one day it's just like um this
[1:23:01] shirt
[1:23:03] is not me. I never really received it as
[1:23:07] a gift. I just couldn't say no. And we
[1:23:10] gave it to someone else.
[1:23:13] And little did I know that that someone
[1:23:15] else thought they looked so good in that
[1:23:16] shirt, they wore it to church.
[1:23:20] And that was a disaster.
[1:23:23] That was a disaster
[1:23:26] cuz they knew who they made the shirt
[1:23:28] for. They know who they gave the gift to
[1:23:31] and someone else shows up wearing it.
[1:23:33] And I I just had to bear the shame
[1:23:38] uh of it. But I'm telling you,
[1:23:42] forgive me for this humor in church, but
[1:23:44] the shame of giving that to someone else
[1:23:48] was much less than the shame would have
[1:23:50] been to be seen in public wearing it. So
[1:23:54] I was like, not me.
[1:23:58] Here we go. But God's giving gifts to
[1:24:01] you and I. He doesn't want to see us
[1:24:04] laying the gift down or ultimately
[1:24:08] saying, "I I think this gift would be
[1:24:10] better if Brother Trevor had it." He
[1:24:13] gave the gift to you. Amen. Whatever
[1:24:17] that gift might be. Amen. Faith for a
[1:24:19] midnight hour. Amen. As the song says,
[1:24:22] if you should find you're in a prison,
[1:24:24] some midnight hour. Amen. and God comes
[1:24:27] on the scene and you take that song to
[1:24:29] heart and you call on the Lord and he
[1:24:31] comes at the midnight hour. That's God's
[1:24:33] gift to you. Amen. That's not something
[1:24:35] he wants you to just toss on a shelf
[1:24:37] somewhere. But you come in that time, in
[1:24:40] that need and apply the gift that God
[1:24:42] gives to you. Amen. And when God comes
[1:24:45] and delivers in that situation, that is
[1:24:48] an achievement that God has given. Amen.
[1:24:51] And shared with you and I, it's
[1:24:53] something God has done. Amen. We're not
[1:24:56] going to defeat the devil in the
[1:24:57] midnight hour. Amen. But the word in us,
[1:25:00] Amen. That word that we received, that
[1:25:02] word that we said amen to, that word
[1:25:05] that we believe enough to repeat it, to
[1:25:08] speak it out, to put it on display.
[1:25:11] Amen. Hallelujah. Amen. Now, we have
[1:25:14] received not the spirit of the world,
[1:25:16] but the spirit which is of God, that we
[1:25:18] might know the things that were freely
[1:25:20] given to us of God. There's no excuse
[1:25:23] for us not to know what God has given
[1:25:25] us. Amen. Many people, my brother and
[1:25:28] sister, they they don't know whether the
[1:25:30] prophet, you know, that was shocking at
[1:25:33] family camp uh when brother Barry's
[1:25:36] gives that, you know, um whole little
[1:25:38] thing of um Billy Graham speaking.
[1:25:42] Only it wasn't Billy Graham.
[1:25:46] It was AI.
[1:25:49] Interesting thought. And then brother
[1:25:51] Barry says, "And I expect to see this
[1:25:53] come into the message." Yeah. Now my
[1:25:56] brother and sister, the gift God has
[1:25:59] given you, and I hope I can present this
[1:26:02] to you correct. The achievement that God
[1:26:06] has given to you and I is not going to
[1:26:10] be intellectual.
[1:26:12] That that's not what the prophet said.
[1:26:14] It's going to be a spiritual gift that
[1:26:18] discerns these things because it's your
[1:26:22] heart and soul that says that's not the
[1:26:27] word. That's right. It won't be because
[1:26:29] you will be able to pull out some kind
[1:26:32] of, you know, I don't know your even
[1:26:34] your phone or whatever to prove or to do
[1:26:37] my brother and sister. It will actually
[1:26:39] come down into your heart and it will be
[1:26:42] your heart and your soul saying that's
[1:26:44] not the word. And it will also be your
[1:26:46] heart and soul that says praise God that
[1:26:49] is the word. Amen. You see this is God's
[1:26:52] achievement. He's not coming for an
[1:26:54] intellectual bride. Oh, he's coming for
[1:26:57] an intimate bride. Don't you just love
[1:27:01] Don't you just love newlyweds? Amen. We
[1:27:03] were just up to to that wedding up there
[1:27:06] in Donley. uh of of the Robson girl and
[1:27:10] uh uh Gideon uh Watkins. And I I just
[1:27:14] love it. I actually like to watch that.
[1:27:16] You know, they set them down back to
[1:27:18] back and they're like, "Which one of you
[1:27:20] is most likely this?" And sometimes that
[1:27:24] might become the very first argument of
[1:27:26] their married life.
[1:27:29] Which one of you is most likely to start
[1:27:31] an argument?
[1:27:33] And both of them lift up, you know,
[1:27:34] because they use the shoe. both of them
[1:27:36] lift up, you know, she lifts up his shoe
[1:27:38] and he lifts up her shoe and then they
[1:27:41] turn and look at each other and they're
[1:27:42] like,
[1:27:44] "No, my brother and sister, what's
[1:27:47] happening is God's coming and he is in
[1:27:51] that element so intimate with his bride
[1:27:57] who's going to protect you and bring you
[1:27:59] into the rapture. We're all going to be
[1:28:02] lifting up his shoe." Amen. who is most
[1:28:06] likely to fall short in this
[1:28:08] relationship. We lift up our shoe. Amen.
[1:28:13] And we realize as we go through this,
[1:28:16] what God is doing is putting on display
[1:28:20] his achievement in our life.
[1:28:24] What he has done, not what we have done,
[1:28:29] but what he has done. And I think we
[1:28:32] have to just go day by day. Nope. The
[1:28:35] credit goes to him. Amen. This is what
[1:28:37] the Lord has done. This is what the Lord
[1:28:39] has done. This is what the Lord has
[1:28:41] done. Amen. And we'll look at that. And
[1:28:43] if we're not careful, we won't
[1:28:45] acknowledge that this is what the Lord
[1:28:47] has done for us. And Satan would love to
[1:28:50] tell us what great Christians we are.
[1:28:54] My brother and sister, the truth of it
[1:28:56] is we're Christians because Christ is in
[1:28:59] us. Amen. There is what makes us right
[1:29:02] great Christians.
[1:29:04] Without him, we're just more
[1:29:08] Bezub,
[1:29:09] fortune teller. That's too shocking.
[1:29:13] That can't be right. But when the Holy
[1:29:16] Spirit comes down and says, "Look, this
[1:29:19] is me." Amen. I'm doing this. Amen. You
[1:29:22] see, there's a difference. I don't want
[1:29:24] to de deviate too far into this for the
[1:29:26] sake of time. Amen. because it looks
[1:29:29] like I'm on my five minutes.
[1:29:31] But look at this, my brother and sister.
[1:29:34] So, there is controversy, and I'll face
[1:29:35] it straight head on. There's controversy
[1:29:38] around the message of those that people
[1:29:40] are saying they're way too Pentecostal
[1:29:42] acting. And then on that side, they're
[1:29:45] looking over and saying, "Those people
[1:29:46] are too cold and formal." But my brother
[1:29:49] and sister, the prophet, I read that to
[1:29:50] you. The prophet of God says, "You just
[1:29:52] come right back." And the bride gets
[1:29:54] right back in the center of that road.
[1:29:56] We shouldn't fall out of our seats.
[1:29:58] Remember, Brother Brown talks about that
[1:30:00] when somebody says, "Amen." And they all
[1:30:02] about fall out of their seat turning
[1:30:03] around to see who said this. It ought to
[1:30:06] be so common to us. And it is. I thank
[1:30:08] the Lord for that. But these things of
[1:30:10] God like this that are proven of God, we
[1:30:13] should uh be able to just say, "That's a
[1:30:15] move of God." Even if somebody gets up
[1:30:17] and let me just phrase it like this,
[1:30:19] cuts a jig, so to speak, down the aisle
[1:30:22] of the church, we shouldn't be saying
[1:30:24] they got a devil on them. My brother and
[1:30:26] sister, if God's anointing them to do
[1:30:28] that, their life will manifest that that
[1:30:31] is real. Amen. If they were just down on
[1:30:34] Saturday night at the the barn club over
[1:30:37] here and they're still dancing on Sunday
[1:30:40] morning, you might want to question
[1:30:41] that. But if they are sons and daughters
[1:30:44] of God and their life is manifested and
[1:30:46] they're anointed by the Holy Ghost,
[1:30:48] maybe we should stop and say, you know,
[1:30:50] Lord, if that is you, you you will
[1:30:52] confirm it. Amen. Because you see God's
[1:30:56] achievement in us is not cookie cutter.
[1:31:00] Amen. We will not each one be exactly
[1:31:03] like the other except in one category
[1:31:07] and that is his spirit. Amen. Every one
[1:31:10] of us is anointed by his spirit. We'll
[1:31:13] have his spirit will display his spirit
[1:31:16] and that spirit will be living so it can
[1:31:18] be read. Amen. See, God didn't say, "I I
[1:31:21] want you to have my spirit, and then I
[1:31:23] want you to be a closed book."
[1:31:27] He says, "I want to give you my spirit
[1:31:29] so it can be on display."
[1:31:32] Oh, thank you, Lord. And sometimes that
[1:31:36] actually takes an achievement from God
[1:31:38] for us to be
[1:31:40] open enough, courageous enough to just
[1:31:43] let it be on display.
[1:31:45] that we don't really care what anyone
[1:31:47] else thinks about us.
[1:31:50] Amen. Let me just move right along here.
[1:31:53] Uh and and you can read this to
[1:31:56] Ephesians uh 2 1-10.
[1:31:59] Uh but well, we got a moment, right? uh
[1:32:03] ye and you hath he quickened who were
[1:32:06] dead in trespass and sin where in times
[1:32:09] past you walked according to the course
[1:32:10] of this world according to the prince of
[1:32:12] the power of the air the spirit that now
[1:32:14] workketh in the children of
[1:32:15] disobedience. So we're connecting this
[1:32:17] back to our original scripture of
[1:32:19] disobedience. Amen. There's where the
[1:32:22] spirit is connected in there. There's a
[1:32:25] disobedience that has to be not just I
[1:32:28] mean we've all been disobedient
[1:32:31] but there's also the spirit of
[1:32:34] disobedience
[1:32:35] and the spirit of disobedience actually
[1:32:38] enjoys
[1:32:40] embraces
[1:32:42] openly particulate
[1:32:44] participates
[1:32:47] in this spirit of disobedience.
[1:32:50] So, this is not talking about us having
[1:32:53] a moment, right? We don't say, "Oh, I
[1:32:57] guess I'm not a Christian because I had
[1:32:59] this moment." But when you see a spirit
[1:33:01] that just continues
[1:33:04] to disobey and push back against the
[1:33:06] word, you recognize there might be a son
[1:33:09] or daughter of God, but they need a
[1:33:11] deliverance. And God provides
[1:33:13] deliverance.
[1:33:16] among whom also we all had our
[1:33:18] conversion in times past in the lusts of
[1:33:20] our flesh, fulfilling the desires of the
[1:33:23] flesh and of the mind, and were by
[1:33:25] nature the children of wrath, even as
[1:33:27] others. But God, who is rich in mercy,
[1:33:30] for his great love wherewith he loved
[1:33:32] us, even when we were
[1:33:36] dead. Amen. This is how great amazing
[1:33:41] the grace of God is.
[1:33:43] Even when we were dead, he says, "I'll
[1:33:46] raise him. I'll raise him." This is a
[1:33:50] 21st century Lazarus. Amen. I'll raise
[1:33:54] them from the dead.
[1:33:58] And you won't continue to stink.
[1:34:02] That's how thorough the deliverance is.
[1:34:06] Amen.
[1:34:10] I could there's a lot of things we could
[1:34:11] deviate off but for time we won't. We
[1:34:14] were dead in sins hath quickened us
[1:34:16] together with Christ by grace ye are
[1:34:18] saved and hath raised us up together and
[1:34:21] made us sit together in heavenly places
[1:34:24] in Christ Jesus that in the ages to come
[1:34:27] he might show the exceeding riches of
[1:34:29] his grace in his kindness toward us
[1:34:32] through Christ Jesus. For by grace are
[1:34:34] you saved through faith, and that not of
[1:34:36] yourself. It is a gift of God, not of
[1:34:41] works, lest any man should boast. For we
[1:34:44] are his workmanship, created in Christ
[1:34:47] Jesus into good works, which God hath
[1:34:50] ordained that we should walk in them.
[1:34:53] Now, my brother and sister, I know that
[1:34:56] we do this, and I'm not trying to be
[1:34:59] hard on this,
[1:35:01] but when we talk about I'm not worthy.
[1:35:05] I'm unrighteous. I'm this. I'm that,
[1:35:08] you're actually calling into question
[1:35:11] God's workmanship.
[1:35:13] You're saying, as this scripture
[1:35:15] declares, that God's workmanship was
[1:35:18] actually faulty.
[1:35:21] Let's not do that. That's right. Let's
[1:35:23] know that God's plan and God's work and
[1:35:26] God's ability is perfect. Amen. So when
[1:35:29] he chose you as the chosen generation of
[1:35:33] this day to express the word in this day
[1:35:37] that his workmanship in you is perfect.
[1:35:41] Now, if you've ever worked with
[1:35:43] furniture and stuff like that, I worked
[1:35:46] with a man once who used to build
[1:35:48] furniture and I always marveled at his
[1:35:50] ability because he would have a post or
[1:35:54] a leg or something arm of a chair. And
[1:35:59] um I always used to think now you got to
[1:36:01] start off and just polish that thing and
[1:36:03] just work forever and ever till you get
[1:36:05] it where you want it. But no, no, not
[1:36:08] Jim.
[1:36:10] He grabs an expensive piece of wood and
[1:36:13] he's got like seemed like 10 grit
[1:36:18] and he's like, "No, this needs to be
[1:36:20] rounded."
[1:36:22] And I'm just like, "Oh, no."
[1:36:26] But the final results always come out.
[1:36:30] And he says, "You just have to be
[1:36:32] willing to form it into what it's
[1:36:36] supposed to be.
[1:36:39] it won't do it itself.
[1:36:43] And then you bring that over in the
[1:36:45] spiritual.
[1:36:46] Have you ever thought, "Oh, Lord,
[1:36:51] I'm not worthy. Lord, I make so many
[1:36:53] mistakes."
[1:36:56] Don't worry, the 10 grit's coming.
[1:36:59] You know, just sit down. Amen. Put your
[1:37:02] spiritual seat belt on. He might be
[1:37:05] tearing the hide off of you. Anybody had
[1:37:07] your hide tore off in church? Amen. He
[1:37:09] might be tearing the hide off on of you.
[1:37:12] But what he's going to do is then come
[1:37:15] and start moving through this from this
[1:37:18] just very abrasive 40 grit and then
[1:37:20] it'll be 80 grit and then it'll be 120
[1:37:23] grit and then 160 grit and then 220 and
[1:37:26] in the end we are a perfect masterpiece
[1:37:29] that was formed by God to match his
[1:37:33] word. Amen. to match his vision of who
[1:37:37] we are. Amen. Because we don't want to
[1:37:40] be sitting here. Because if you get in
[1:37:42] the habit of saying, "I'm not good
[1:37:46] enough. I'm not worthy. I'm not this.
[1:37:48] I'm not that." You get in the habit of
[1:37:51] questioning God's workmanship. And when
[1:37:54] you are being molded into the place of
[1:37:56] perfection, cuz I wished we could just
[1:37:59] kind of go into old home mode here for a
[1:38:01] minute. And I would sit down here and I
[1:38:03] would ask each one of you, what is your
[1:38:06] idea of perfection?
[1:38:15] I have GPS on tractors. I pay a lot of
[1:38:18] money every year to use their satellites
[1:38:20] and their programs. And it's supposed to
[1:38:23] be sub one inch.
[1:38:26] I'm happy if it's within two.
[1:38:30] What is perfection? My idea of
[1:38:32] perfection is if I had prepared the soil
[1:38:36] perfectly, there's no doubt it could do
[1:38:38] it with one inch. But I want to save
[1:38:41] money. So I only work the soil to this
[1:38:44] level. It's still got bumps.
[1:38:49] And so I'm satisfied with two inches.
[1:38:53] I've got neighbors that like I tried GPS
[1:38:55] and it don't work.
[1:38:58] M
[1:39:01] your level of perfection
[1:39:04] was more than it can do for you.
[1:39:07] Now we look in the mirror and we think,
[1:39:10] "I got to get up every day of the week
[1:39:12] and I've got to be this perfect
[1:39:14] Christian." Do you realize that if God
[1:39:18] made Enoch perfect in our ideas,
[1:39:24] he would have been obligated to make you
[1:39:26] perfect? Yeah. according to the very
[1:39:29] same principle.
[1:39:31] Enoch wasn't nearly as perfect as we get
[1:39:34] an idea that he was. But what does the
[1:39:37] scripture Can somebody tell me the
[1:39:38] wording
[1:39:40] that comes with Enoch in the scripture?
[1:39:45] He
[1:39:46] walked
[1:39:48] with God.
[1:39:52] He didn't run away. He didn't go off on
[1:39:55] his own path. You didn't find him over
[1:39:57] here saying, "I think this is actually
[1:39:59] God's will for my life." He walked with
[1:40:04] God.
[1:40:06] And God said, "He's perfect."
[1:40:09] And then he walked and was not. That's
[1:40:12] right. See, we got to come to a place to
[1:40:15] understand when it's perfect, he's not
[1:40:19] going to perfect this.
[1:40:22] He's going to perfect this. Amen. That's
[1:40:25] exactly. Amen. And when you walk down in
[1:40:28] the stream bed to defeat your enemy, God
[1:40:32] will lead you to that stone
[1:40:34] to defeat that enemy. Amen. And you
[1:40:37] will, because you're walking with God,
[1:40:40] choose the right stone, the correct
[1:40:43] stone. Amen.
[1:40:46] You know, we hear a lot of this. Brother
[1:40:48] Brandham said it. We hear a lot of this.
[1:40:50] People have no more faith, my brother
[1:40:52] and sister. No more focus. and they're
[1:40:54] like, "Boo, devil." You think the
[1:40:56] devil's scared of somebody that's
[1:40:58] yelling a hollow boo at them? No. It
[1:41:02] needs to be a boo backed by the word. It
[1:41:06] needs to be a boo that has faith behind
[1:41:10] it. And when a boo has faith behind it,
[1:41:13] the devil knows that the stone of faith,
[1:41:16] which is the word in action, is coming
[1:41:19] and they're defeated. Amen. You know
[1:41:22] good and well if Goliath had thought
[1:41:24] that that stone would kill him, he would
[1:41:27] have guarded himself. But all he's
[1:41:29] worried about is this little 5 foot five
[1:41:31] little peep squeak and he's holding the
[1:41:33] sword down, the shield down here because
[1:41:36] that's the level you deal with a 5 foot
[1:41:38] five.
[1:41:40] But that wasn't the level God was
[1:41:41] dealing. Amen. And Satan, my brother and
[1:41:45] sisters, no more scared of a boovil that
[1:41:48] comes from somebody who's shaking in
[1:41:50] their boots and not sure what they
[1:41:52] believe. But God's accomplishment is as
[1:41:55] we sit here tonight as sons and
[1:41:57] daughters of God. And he's reaffirming
[1:42:00] who we are and what we believe and where
[1:42:04] we stand. And by that, we can stand
[1:42:07] here. And I would close with this,
[1:42:08] Sister Ruth. Amen.
[1:42:11] I am in spite of my mistakes. You are in
[1:42:15] spite of your mistakes God's achievement
[1:42:18] in this age. Amen. You are the rapture.
[1:42:23] Amen. Amen. Because God has promised
[1:42:26] this work I began in you, I will finish.
[1:42:30] Do you feel the finishing touches
[1:42:32] coming? Amen. I felt the the 40 grit.
[1:42:36] Amen. I felt that, you know, belt sander
[1:42:38] effect. Amen. when you realize just how
[1:42:41] messed up you are in your thinking and
[1:42:43] that. But you know what? He then comes
[1:42:45] and he's polishing it. And you ever work
[1:42:48] with a master that works with wood and
[1:42:52] his last
[1:42:54] moments, his last time with that is no
[1:42:57] longer a sandpaper, a hand. It's a
[1:43:02] caress. That's right.
[1:43:05] But it's still forming even in the
[1:43:08] caress.
[1:43:09] It's bringing it to the exact
[1:43:12] perfection.
[1:43:13] And then that man might put out a chair
[1:43:16] or a table or something and people say,
[1:43:19] "My, what an achievement."
[1:43:22] But look what the Lord's going to
[1:43:23] present one day. Amen. He's going to
[1:43:26] present us to the bride of ages gone by,
[1:43:29] to the saints of ages gone by, and
[1:43:32] they're going to say, "Look at this
[1:43:33] masterpiece."
[1:43:35] And not one of us can say, "Praise God."
[1:43:38] We'll just have to say it was a touch of
[1:43:41] the master's hand that molded me and
[1:43:45] created faith in me and reassured me and
[1:43:50] caressed me and held me and
[1:43:53] sometimes corrected me. But here I am.
[1:43:57] That's right. This is who makes me think
[1:43:59] of the Lefontaine song. Are you She
[1:44:03] the bride of this last day.
[1:44:06] Think about how marvelous and how
[1:44:09] incredible
[1:44:11] God's achievement in our lives is. Amen.
[1:44:15] Can someone say thank you Lord? Amen.
[1:44:20] Hallelujah.
[1:44:22] I want to jump. Sorry to drag this out.
[1:44:24] This is the biggest five minutes you
[1:44:26] ever seen. Revelations five real quick.
[1:44:29] Let's just jump down here and we'll go
[1:44:31] right to verse nine. You're you're
[1:44:33] familiar. You can go home and read it.
[1:44:35] Uh also uh but uh Revelations 5 and9 and
[1:44:40] they sung a new song.
[1:44:44] Thou are worthy to take the book to open
[1:44:46] the seals thereof. For thou was slain
[1:44:49] and hast redeemed us to God by thy blood
[1:44:53] out of every kindred and tongue and
[1:44:55] people and nation. I've heard it
[1:44:57] preached before. Oh, these are angels.
[1:44:58] But my brother and sister, the angels
[1:45:00] were never lost, so they were never
[1:45:02] redeemed. This is you and I that's going
[1:45:04] to be standing there and we're going to
[1:45:07] be singing a new song. It's not a song
[1:45:10] of oh Lord forgive me my weakness, my
[1:45:12] failure. It's going to be songs of
[1:45:14] praise. And I say Lord, help us to
[1:45:18] realize now
[1:45:20] what he's done for us, what God's
[1:45:22] achievement in our life is right now.
[1:45:25] Amen. not to look at the weakness of our
[1:45:28] flesh and to look as it would be to one
[1:45:30] another and say, "I see this and I see
[1:45:32] this." But let's look and see what God
[1:45:34] has done. Let's focus on what God has
[1:45:37] done, not what he's still working on.
[1:45:41] And it will change our perspective and
[1:45:44] hast made us
[1:45:47] unto our God kings and priests, and we
[1:45:50] shall reign on the earth.
[1:45:54] Now my brother and sister, I'll leave
[1:45:57] this to you to decide where this
[1:45:59] applies.
[1:46:00] Is this reigning on the earth before or
[1:46:03] after the millennium?
[1:46:05] [Music]
[1:46:07] There's no reason for you and I to not
[1:46:09] with bold confidence
[1:46:13] take the word of God and what he's done
[1:46:15] in our life and declare, "I'm going to
[1:46:18] reign here." Amen. Now,
[1:46:22] I can reign right here. I can show the
[1:46:25] devil this is what God did for me. This
[1:46:28] is what he's done in my life. And I'm
[1:46:29] sorry, devil. You can't defeat this. You
[1:46:31] won't defeat this. And you will never
[1:46:34] keep me from fulfilling this because I
[1:46:37] am God's achievement. I am his word made
[1:46:41] flesh in this hour.
[1:46:44] Oh, help us Lord. Hallelujah.
[1:46:48] Hallelujah.
[1:46:50] Amen.
[1:46:52] 556. Brother Ivan.
[1:46:55] Amen. God bless you. Thank you for being
[1:46:57] so so patient tonight. So attentive.
[1:47:01] Amen. Let's just stand and sing a song
[1:47:03] or two. Amen.
[1:47:07] I think this song goes I was just as I
[1:47:09] was studying this song just come alive
[1:47:11] to me and I was like, "Yep, here it is."
[1:47:12] Amen.
[1:47:15] Redeemed how I love to proclaim
[1:47:20] it. Redeemed by the blood of the lamb.
[1:47:26] Redeemed through his infinite mercy.
[1:47:31] His child and forever I am
[1:47:37] redeemed.
[1:47:39] Redeemed.
[1:47:42] Redeemed by the blood of the lamb.
[1:47:48] Redeemed.
[1:47:49] [Music]
[1:47:51] Redeemed.
[1:47:53] [Music]
[1:47:55] His child and forever. I am
[1:48:00] redeemed and so happy in Jesus.
[1:48:06] No language my rapture can tell.
[1:48:11] I know that the light of his presence
[1:48:16] with me doth continually dwell.
[1:48:22] Redeemed,
[1:48:24] redeemed,
[1:48:27] redeemed by the blood of the lamb.
[1:48:33] Redee
[1:48:34] [Applause]
[1:48:34] [Music]
[1:48:36] redeemed
[1:48:39] [Music]
[1:48:40] his
[1:48:42] forever. I am.
[1:48:46] I think of my blessed redeemer.
[1:48:51] I think of him all the day long.
[1:48:57] I sing for I cannot be silent.
[1:49:02] His love is the theme of my song.
[1:49:08] Redeemed,
[1:49:11] redeemed,
[1:49:13] redeemed by the blood of the lamb.
[1:49:19] redeem
[1:49:20] [Applause]
[1:49:22] redeem
[1:49:24] [Music]
[1:49:24] [Applause]
[1:49:26] his child and forever I am.
[1:49:32] I know I shall see in his beauty.
[1:49:37] The king in whose law I delight.
[1:49:41] [Music]
[1:49:43] who lovingly guardeth my footsteps
[1:49:48] and giveth me songs in the night.
[1:49:54] Redeem,
[1:49:56] redeem,
[1:49:59] redeem by the blood of the lamb.
[1:50:05] redeem.
[1:50:06] [Applause]
[1:50:08] Redeem
[1:50:10] [Music]
[1:50:12] his child and forever I am.
[1:50:18] Amen. Can we say amen to that tonight?
[1:50:21] Hallelujah. 893.
[1:50:25] Hallelujah. We'll just dismiss on this
[1:50:27] song.
[1:50:29] Amen. I really like this song. Amen.
[1:50:37] Father, I see that you are drawing
[1:50:42] a line in the sand. I want to be
[1:50:46] standing on your side,
[1:50:50] holding your hand. So let your kingom
[1:50:55] come. Let it live in me. This is my
[1:51:01] prayer.
[1:51:03] This is my plea.
[1:51:07] Father, I see that you are drawing
[1:51:11] a line in the sand. Want to be standing
[1:51:16] on your side.
[1:51:18] Oh, holding your hand. So, let your
[1:51:22] kingom come. Let it live in me. This is
[1:51:29] my prayer.
[1:51:32] This is my plea.
[1:51:36] Let the worshippers arise.
[1:51:42] Let the sons and the daughters sing.
[1:51:49] I'm surrendering
[1:51:51] my all.
[1:51:56] I surrender to the king.
[1:52:03] Father, I hear it growing louder.
[1:52:08] Song of your redeem. As the saints of
[1:52:12] every nation are awakening, awakening to
[1:52:16] sing from our heart. There comes an
[1:52:20] anthem.
[1:52:22] Oh, here the heavens ring is our song.
[1:52:28] Song to our king.
[1:52:32] Let the worshipers arise.
[1:52:39] Let the sons and the daughters sing.
[1:52:45] I'm surrendering my all.
[1:52:50] [Music]
[1:52:52] I surrender to the king. Let's sing the
[1:52:55] chorus again.
[1:52:58] Let the worshippers arise.
[1:53:05] Let the sons and the daughters sing.
[1:53:11] I'm surrendering my all.
[1:53:16] [Music]
[1:53:18] I surrender to the king.
[1:53:22] Could we just lift our hands and
[1:53:23] surrender for just a moment?
[1:53:26] Lord, we come tonight and we lift our
[1:53:28] hands in a universal sign of surrender.
[1:53:32] Lord, we surrender to our king. Lord,
[1:53:35] help us to surrender our all. Let us
[1:53:38] open the door, Father, to every room of
[1:53:41] our house, every room of our being.
[1:53:44] Father, forgive us for the times, Lord,
[1:53:47] we've tried to keep a door closed cuz we
[1:53:49] were ashamed of of what was behind that
[1:53:52] door. But Lord, we're here tonight to
[1:53:55] say thank you. Thank you Lord Jesus
[1:53:58] because your achievement in our life is
[1:54:00] becoming more open, more plain, more
[1:54:02] revealed each and every day of what you
[1:54:05] have called us to and how you are doing
[1:54:07] it. Lord, it is word upon word. It's
[1:54:11] line upon line. You're drawing us into
[1:54:13] your presence, Lord. You're changing us,
[1:54:17] Father. As we move forward, we move into
[1:54:19] your presence, Lord. Father, we don't
[1:54:22] want to be walking away or a different
[1:54:24] path, but as the song says, Lord, we
[1:54:27] want to be walking, holding your hand,
[1:54:30] Lord, being drawn into your presence to
[1:54:33] one day realize the beautiful gift,
[1:54:36] Lord, of what you have done.
[1:54:40] Rapturing faith, Father, will be your
[1:54:42] achievement in our life.
[1:54:45] Lord, the rapture itself will be your
[1:54:48] achievement in our life.
[1:54:51] Lord, to stand before you in the sea of
[1:54:55] crystal before the throne.
[1:54:58] Lord, we will have only arrived, only
[1:55:01] made it there by your amazing grace.
[1:55:06] We say thank you, Lord.
[1:55:08] Thank you, Lord. Just want to give you
[1:55:11] praise, Father, for all that you do for
[1:55:14] us. your hand upon us. Your love that is
[1:55:18] so plain, so obvious.
[1:55:22] Lord, your love that's redeemed us. We
[1:55:26] give praise to you tonight, Lord. I just
[1:55:28] ask you to bless each one,
[1:55:32] Father. And when we would be tempted of
[1:55:34] the devil
[1:55:35] to confess that we're not worthy, we're
[1:55:38] unable, that we have failed,
[1:55:42] help us, Lord, not to question your
[1:55:45] workmanship,
[1:55:46] but to simply say, Lord, I am your work
[1:55:49] in progress.
[1:55:51] And father, if you have to start, Lord,
[1:55:55] with that with that grit, Father, that
