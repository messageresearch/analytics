[33:32] tonight turn with me to Acts chapter one
[33:36] um my apologies to you and the sound
[33:40] guys I didn't know the computer was
[33:41] fixed so I didn't send my quotes till
[33:43] like 10 minutes
[33:45] ago when Gideon texted me
[33:49] so I should have asked because I there's
[33:53] a lot of quotes I would love for you to
[33:54] read along with but I can always post
[33:57] them for you later Acts chapter
[34:01] 1 verse
[34:13] 10 so Jesus has has completed his
[34:19] ministry in this dispensation of him in
[34:23] flesh and now he's
[34:25] transitioning
[34:27] and at the same
[34:29] time his disciples are
[34:34] transitioning verse 9 we'll start there
[34:37] and when he had spoken these things
[34:38] while they beheld he was taken up and a
[34:40] cloud received him out of their sight
[34:43] and while they looked steadfastly toward
[34:45] Heaven as he went up behold two men
[34:47] stood by him in white apparel which also
[34:50] said you men of Galilee why stand you
[34:52] gazing up into heaven this same Jesus
[34:55] which is taken up from you into heaven
[34:57] shall so come in like manner as you have
[35:00] seen him go into
[35:02] heaven then returned they unto Jerusalem
[35:05] from the mount called olet which is from
[35:08] Jerusalem a Sabbath Day's
[35:12] Journey so I'm guessing that's about a
[35:14] week and when they were come in they
[35:16] went up into an upper room where Abode
[35:18] both Peter and James and John and Andrew
[35:22] Philip Thomas Bartholomew Matthew James
[35:24] the son of alfus Simon Zealot and Judas
[35:27] the brother of James these all continued
[35:30] with one Accord in prayer and
[35:31] supplication with the women and Mary the
[35:34] mother of Jesus and with his
[35:37] Brethren chapter 2 verse one and when
[35:41] the day of Pentecost was fully come they
[35:43] were all with one Accord in one place
[35:45] and suddenly there came a sound from
[35:47] Heaven as of a rushing Mighty Wind and
[35:50] it filled all the house where they were
[35:53] sitting and there appeared unto them
[35:56] clothing tongues like as of fire and it
[35:59] sat upon each of them and they're all
[36:01] filled with the Holy Ghost and began to
[36:03] speak with other tongues as the spirit
[36:05] gave them utterance and there were
[36:07] dwelling at Jerusalem Jews devout men
[36:10] out of every nation under heaven now
[36:12] when this was noise abroad the multitude
[36:14] came together and were confounded
[36:17] because that every man heard them speak
[36:19] in his own language and they were all
[36:21] amazed and marveled saying one to
[36:23] another behold are not all these which
[36:25] speak galileans
[36:29] let's skip down to verse 12 and they
[36:32] were all amazed and were in doubt saying
[36:34] one to another what mean it this others
[36:35] mocking said these men are full of new
[36:38] wine not completely wrong but Peter
[36:42] standing up with the 11 lifted up his
[36:44] voice and said unto them ye men of Judea
[36:46] and all ye that dwell at Jerusalem be
[36:48] this known unto you and hearken to my
[36:50] words for these are not drunken as you
[36:52] suppose seeing it is but the third hour
[36:54] of the day but this is that which which
[36:56] was spoken by the prophet Joel and it
[36:58] shall come to pass in the last day saith
[37:00] God I will pour out my spirit upon All
[37:03] Flesh and your sons and your daughters
[37:05] shall prophesy and your young men shall
[37:07] see visions and your old men shall dream
[37:09] dreams and on my servants and on my
[37:11] handmaidens I will pour out in those
[37:13] days of my spirit and they shall
[37:15] prophesy may the Lord bless your reading
[37:17] of his word you can be seated
[37:23] tonight
[37:25] amen
[37:28] so I'd like to take tonight uh the title
[37:31] emotions
[37:33] position emotions position and I want I
[37:38] just trusting in the Lord to speak to
[37:40] our hearts tonight and you know we can
[37:44] be we can be given a sword and we might
[37:47] get lucky and and make a strike but we
[37:50] fight better when we know how to use a
[37:53] sword so we can't just take the word and
[37:56] say we got the word we got the word we
[37:57] got the word we have to learn how to use
[37:59] the word and God gives us revelation God
[38:02] gives us faith and upon that he builds
[38:05] up the statue of a perfect man and
[38:09] through that we find victory in our
[38:11] lives we overcome we overcome doubts we
[38:14] overcome you know we can't liit o limit
[38:17] overcoming to just sins although CU sin
[38:21] is actually
[38:23] unbelief overcoming is is having is
[38:26] having victory over
[38:27] doubt having overcoming is is is seeing
[38:31] is understanding more of God having more
[38:34] Revelation to live a life that is
[38:36] higher overcoming raises the standard in
[38:39] your life but you can't do so while
[38:41] you're running around like a child we
[38:44] can't take the scripture where it says
[38:46] childlike faith and think we can stay
[38:48] children we have to grow in maturity
[38:51] Amen to become sons of God we are
[38:54] pursuing Perfection look at theour
[38:56] Journey Abraham had to take to get to
[38:58] the place where he could receive the
[39:00] promised
[39:01] son you can't we can't just just take it
[39:04] and run with it we got to know what
[39:06] God's talking about we have to have we
[39:07] have to lay in the word we have to say
[39:09] God teach me brother B says the ministry
[39:13] of an evangelist brings the sinner to
[39:15] Christ and teaching positionally places
[39:18] the church right we are given a
[39:20] five-fold Ministry amen depending on who
[39:24] you talk to depending on who you
[39:25] Fellowship some emphasize one of those
[39:27] fivefold but God given has given all
[39:30] five to bring the church into balance
[39:33] that's right if we just all ran around
[39:35] and it was it was we just had evangelism
[39:37] and evangelism and evangelis evangelism
[39:40] we would never be positionally placed
[39:42] that's right right that is that's a a a
[39:45] thing we need at times in our life we
[39:47] need it when we get saved we need it at
[39:49] different points in our life where
[39:50] sometimes we just need the word to come
[39:52] and and in in that underneath that
[39:54] anointing but it's all all the spirit of
[39:57] God Amen when you preach the word it's
[40:00] all the spirit of God so tonight my
[40:03] desire is is to to to lay out for you if
[40:06] I could and you know had all these this
[40:08] this big tray here like a Sherie board
[40:11] and I could lay out the quotes and the
[40:13] scriptures and the position and allow
[40:15] you to take that home meditate on it
[40:18] pray on it and say this is and you see
[40:21] it not me stand here and tell you I'm
[40:24] I'm really praying the Lord keeps that
[40:26] from
[40:26] from me telling you what to believe
[40:29] that's right but to present to you what
[40:32] the word says which is really our
[40:35] mission statement that's as
[40:38] ministers I really I really like my this
[40:41] is all my this is now my opinion but to
[40:43] present to you what the word
[40:46] says when I when a statement is made
[40:49] that the word would be there to back
[40:50] that up amen Mark chapter
[40:54] 16 so our title tonight is emotions
[40:58] position Mark 16 verse 14-
[41:09] 20 and a afterward he appeared unto the
[41:12] 11 as they sat at meat and abided them
[41:14] with their unbelief and Hardness of
[41:16] Heart because they believed not them
[41:18] which had seen him after he was
[41:22] risen and he said unto them go you into
[41:25] all the world and preach the gospel to
[41:27] Every Creature he that believeth and is
[41:30] baptized shall be saved but he that
[41:32] believeth not shall be damned and these
[41:35] signs shall follow them that believe in
[41:37] my name shall they cast out Devils they
[41:39] shall speak with new tongues they shall
[41:41] take up serpents and if they drink any
[41:43] deadly thing it shall not hurt them they
[41:45] shall lay hands on the sick and they
[41:48] shall recover so then after the Lord had
[41:51] spoken unto them he was received up into
[41:53] heaven and sat on the right hand of God
[41:55] and then they went forth and preached
[41:57] everywhere the Lord working with them
[41:59] and confirming the word with signs
[42:05] following did God did Jesus when he
[42:08] ascended into the heaven did he abandon
[42:10] the disciples to their own mental
[42:14] faculties he gave them the word he
[42:17] preached them for however was his
[42:19] ministry about three and a half years he
[42:21] preached to them they didn't understand
[42:24] what they had
[42:26] they didn't know what they
[42:29] had
[42:31] and the angel comes to them and says go
[42:33] t in the room go or go back to Jerusalem
[42:36] and T there and the the same thing that
[42:39] took Jesus up is going to come down into
[42:43] you the spirit of Christ is going to
[42:46] come and then give you utterance give
[42:48] you unction give you
[42:51] leadership so when we say when we say
[42:55] now you know
[42:59] what praise the Lord I'm just going to
[43:02] preach when we
[43:05] say we the the book of Acts written
[43:08] again in our day that is the disciples
[43:12] taking what they learned from God
[43:15] through Revelation and bringing it forth
[43:19] amen Acts 2:38 be baptized in the name
[43:21] of Jesus Christ directly
[43:24] contradicts Matthew
[43:26] baptize them in the name of the father
[43:28] Son and the Holy Ghost but it was the
[43:32] manifestation of Revelation in their
[43:35] lives from the word so some could have
[43:39] said well you you got to say what Jesus
[43:42] says and they would have
[43:45] gone off but they were saying that's
[43:49] what Jesus
[43:50] said you see where the devil slips
[43:54] in and
[43:58] so we have to we have to be careful we
[44:01] have to we have to be studious we have
[44:04] to we have to commit to
[44:06] prayer what we need God to show us we
[44:09] have to say God your word open your word
[44:11] to me and and that's not enough we then
[44:13] have to open our hearts to God we have
[44:16] to surrender ourselves to God and you
[44:19] know the more I know the excuse me the
[44:21] more I know the more I learn about God
[44:23] the more I greater Revelation I the more
[44:26] overwhelmed I am by how much he is amen
[44:32] there is so much to God because he is
[44:35] eternal and we will never figure it all
[44:37] out in 1963 a paradox so let's step into
[44:42] this thought here tonight emotions
[44:44] position says you thinking you have you
[44:48] thinking you have and having it is two
[44:51] different things that's right you might
[44:53] be able to try to say you have you might
[44:56] be able to show some evidence of some
[44:58] emotion but unless your life is
[45:01] Vindicated what you're professing to
[45:03] have you still haven't got it amen the
[45:07] proper definition of go of you being
[45:10] born again is you bearing the fruits of
[45:13] Christ amen now that's that's overcoming
[45:17] your flesh desires that's that's
[45:19] overcoming your laziness that's
[45:22] overcoming your anger that's
[45:24] overcoming
[45:27] life people say there's something
[45:29] different about you when you are not
[45:33] inspired you are
[45:37] overcoming that is the evidence
[45:40] receiving the word see I just I said as
[45:44] I said a few sentences and I got some
[45:47] puzzled looks I just said with different
[45:50] words but it means the same thing the
[45:52] evidence of the holy spirit is you
[45:53] saying Amen to the word of God for your
[45:56] day and acting upon it that's right you
[45:59] see sometimes we get caught up I don't
[46:01] know why I feel to go this way but I'm
[46:02] just going to step off this way real
[46:04] quick and ride the wave like brother Ron
[46:06] said we I I witnessed an I witnessed
[46:10] something that was quite uh to me was
[46:12] profound and that was that there was
[46:14] there was a certain church and I want to
[46:16] be careful on the details here that
[46:19] received their Pastor to minister to
[46:21] them for several years while some in the
[46:24] congregation said he stopped preaching
[46:26] the
[46:27] word he never verbally and outright
[46:30] denied the message but he stopped
[46:31] preaching the word so some of those men
[46:33] as you should rose up went to him he
[46:36] said well no that's not the way I see it
[46:38] and they
[46:40] departed 5 to 7 years later then the
[46:44] pastor gets up and says I don't accept
[46:46] William brandham I don't accept the
[46:48] message now the people who stayed says
[46:51] okay you can't be the
[46:53] pastor the problem is it was because
[46:56] what it was it was hinging on the fact
[46:59] that this he he is not preaching the
[47:01] word but he didn't say I don't accept
[47:05] the message so their basis their their
[47:07] their walk with this whole thing is
[47:13] is is a is is more of a of a well well
[47:17] he said it this is the line he says it
[47:19] so because he said it because brother
[47:21] brandom said it in the quote I believe
[47:24] it right
[47:27] yeah but that's not why we believe it
[47:30] right we don't believe it because
[47:31] there's a quote for it right we believe
[47:34] it because it's the word amen that's
[47:36] right so if you just take a quote and
[47:38] you go with that you can go anywhere in
[47:40] the world you want with that that's
[47:42] right if you take us just a scripture
[47:43] you can go anywhere in the world you
[47:44] want with that you can have several
[47:47] scriptures several quotes but it was the
[47:49] word so as soon as the man came out and
[47:51] said well I don't accept brother bham
[47:53] and he said those words now they say
[47:55] well we can't receive you and in
[47:58] ministering in
[48:00] ministering you pick that up when you
[48:02] would say something differently now
[48:04] you're still saying the word you're
[48:06] still preaching the word but you word it
[48:08] differently right they would lock up but
[48:12] as soon as you worded it as a message
[48:14] cliche they received it you understand
[48:17] the the the the danger in that where
[48:19] just you're just taking it word by word
[48:22] but you're not taking the life you're
[48:24] not taking you're not taking on Christ
[48:26] amen that is the that's when you have a
[48:29] kid a child you're raising and they obey
[48:32] because you told them
[48:36] to that's fine when they're really small
[48:39] but as they grow up it is your
[48:42] obligation to teach them the moral
[48:43] reason why that's right now as young
[48:47] adults as youth you behave you listen to
[48:51] the law you listen to your parents you
[48:53] do what's right not because someone's
[48:55] waiting there
[48:56] to cast judgment upon you not because
[48:59] the cops are there ready to arrest you
[49:02] but because it's the morally sound thing
[49:04] to do because God Said So Right
[49:08] ex so we had a season where we were
[49:11] children we didn't know what we
[49:13] had I'm talking broad terms because some
[49:16] of these I wasn't even alive
[49:18] yet but there's a part in your journey
[49:20] where that's fine and that's okay but
[49:22] then you have to grow into your position
[49:25] the the Israelites came out of Egypt
[49:27] you're talking about a miraculous move
[49:30] but then it was time to come into their
[49:33] position am that's where many of them
[49:38] failed that's where Judas failed when it
[49:40] was time for him to step into his
[49:43] position he could not receive it because
[49:46] to step into your position is to
[49:50] surrender everything that you have that
[49:53] is yours yeah you can be I and I know I
[49:57] said this already but it helps make the
[49:59] point you can be boyfriend girlfriend
[50:01] relationship with Jesus and that's fun
[50:05] but there's no commitment that's
[50:08] right so you see you see somebody they
[50:10] might be at that point in their journey
[50:13] and they're going they're going to act
[50:14] and they're going to express themselves
[50:16] in a certain
[50:18] way and and sometimes we don't always
[50:21] understand understand what's going on
[50:23] but it's there's comes a season where
[50:26] now it's time to make a
[50:28] commitment that's being born again you
[50:31] make that commitment now it's not that
[50:33] you said okay I make a
[50:35] commitment
[50:37] no go you have the faith God's and God
[50:41] answers that faith in your heart okay we
[50:44] we went off on that now let's come back
[50:45] I don't know what that was there but so
[50:48] he says but unless your life is
[50:50] vindicating what you're professing to
[50:52] have you still haven't got it no matter
[50:55] matter how many emotions how much you
[50:57] jump run Sensations speaking in tongues
[51:00] or shouting or whatever you might lay it
[51:03] upon which is all right I believe in all
[51:07] that too but unless your life copes with
[51:11] your testimony that's right so your life
[51:15] has to match your
[51:18] testimony then you haven't got it
[51:21] because the fruit of the spirit
[51:23] vindicates what you are
[51:25] just like the fruit of any tree tells
[51:28] what it is Jesus said by the fruits you
[51:30] shall know them amen now what we could
[51:34] we could we could take a whole another
[51:35] sermon on what fruits
[51:38] are because if if you're not careful
[51:41] then you start to interpret now I want
[51:43] you to to I want you to understand I'm
[51:46] simply bringing this out and I'm I'm
[51:49] going to sound maybe at some point I'll
[51:51] sound like I'm contradicting myself but
[51:54] I want you to just take it out this is
[51:57] not this is just what the word
[51:59] says just is just it laid out there for
[52:02] you to for you to take home and and and
[52:05] and chew on it and study it
[52:09] out if you're not careful we say the
[52:12] fruits are the emotional expression
[52:16] talking about emotions because emotion
[52:17] has a position in our Christian walk I
[52:20] have quotes right
[52:23] here well I'll get to the some of these
[52:26] quotes but I have but okay there's
[52:29] quotes says if your if your religion
[52:31] doesn't have an emotion you need to bury
[52:33] it so emotion so I this this all came
[52:36] about because I was seeing all these
[52:39] different things and and everything
[52:40] going on and you know what I I know you
[52:43] know you I don't really care about all
[52:46] these other churches and what they want
[52:47] to do this is this is where I live and
[52:50] this is where I go to church and this is
[52:51] where God has called me to minister at
[52:54] yes so this is where I care about so
[52:56] sometimes you can think well why is is a
[52:58] preacher preaching something you know
[53:00] well God knows what we need okay so we
[53:03] cannot throw emotions out the window no
[53:07] so I I saw I saw the overuse of emotions
[53:11] and I saw the underuse of emotion and
[53:13] then I saw in the word where it says
[53:14] this and it says this and God spoke to
[53:17] my heart and said emotion has a position
[53:21] absolutely I didn't know that
[53:23] position God lay that on my heart to
[53:25] minister this
[53:28] tonight if you're not careful then you
[53:30] look at the fruits and you say you say
[53:33] an emotional a positive emotional
[53:36] response to the preacher is the fruits
[53:39] of the Holy Spirit but that is not
[53:42] fruits that's
[53:43] right that is a manifestation because
[53:47] and
[53:48] um man I got ahead of myself that's okay
[53:52] I'm going to catch up with my with these
[53:54] quotes here and in faith 1958 he says
[53:56] now usually experience a company's
[53:59] faith and and that's the reason that
[54:02] usually it takes a person that's
[54:03] acquainted with Christ as the
[54:05] Forgiveness of their sins to know that
[54:07] he has forgiven you you have an
[54:09] experience when you are born again that
[54:13] Christ forgave you and you know it
[54:15] therefore with that experience it's easy
[54:17] then for you to believe God for anything
[54:18] that he
[54:20] promised an experience is is is an event
[54:24] an experience there's no specific way an
[54:28] experience has to happen an experience
[54:31] is you meet
[54:33] God how that transcends into your flesh
[54:36] is based on your
[54:40] personality or lack
[54:44] thereof voice of God in the last days
[54:47] 1963 now I had the privilege of leading
[54:49] 10,000 muhammadans to Christ one time at
[54:51] Durban South Africa it produces nothing
[54:54] but psychology
[54:56] and psychology ready for this hold on to
[54:58] your seats and psychology is all right
[55:01] as long as psychology don't deny the
[55:03] word that's right psychology is is is
[55:07] the way your brain
[55:08] works God created psychology when he
[55:11] created your
[55:14] brain it takes an uncertain sound excuse
[55:17] me but when psychology denies the word
[55:19] then psychology is wrong it gives an
[55:22] uncertain sound there's everything else
[55:23] will pass but God's word Jesus said so
[55:25] heavens and earth will pass away but my
[55:27] word shall never pass away so you see we
[55:30] must stay with the word he didn't say
[55:34] stay with the word get rid of psychology
[55:37] he said stay with the word
[55:41] amen it fascinates me to no
[55:44] end how we as as as human beings consume
[55:48] information and make assumptions based
[55:51] on our own experiences that's right
[55:57] I've heard it said money is the root of
[55:58] all evil that's not what the Bible says
[56:02] Bible says the
[56:03] love of
[56:06] money but if you hear if you hear that
[56:09] if you if you have a certain viewpoint
[56:12] on life you have a certain personality
[56:14] that that tends
[56:17] negative you can jump right on that wow
[56:19] money is the root of all evil you see
[56:21] how it happens nobody ever told that
[56:23] person
[56:25] no one ever said money is the root of
[56:27] all evil they said the love of money is
[56:29] the root of all evil but you heard it
[56:31] through your
[56:32] experiences and you said well money is
[56:34] the road of all evil you see what
[56:37] happens no wonder we need God that's
[56:40] we're just a mess on our own that's
[56:42] right see so you must stay with the word
[56:46] Dr Moses
[56:48] 1955 how much psychology that doesn't
[56:51] mean anything I don't say it doesn't
[56:53] mean anything pardon me
[56:55] it helps psychology but it doesn't take
[56:58] the place of reality that's right
[57:00] psychology is something you're thinking
[57:02] of or mentally worked up to so that is a
[57:05] definition of psychology he used
[57:07] psychology on them that is a definition
[57:09] of
[57:10] psychology further defining definition
[57:13] of psychology is the study of your mind
[57:14] and how you think and your social act
[57:18] interactions I I have there's a
[57:20] scripture in the Bible that says God
[57:22] have not given us a spirit of fear but
[57:23] of power and of love and of a sound mind
[57:27] brother V says in multiple places you
[57:30] can't put all the quotes in there's not
[57:32] enough room in one sermon but B says in
[57:34] multiple places you know as a ministers
[57:36] we cover the high points you go home and
[57:38] consume it deeper he says multiple
[57:41] places that it starts in your
[57:43] mind amen and then goes down to your
[57:46] soul Revelation brings it from here to
[57:48] here that's right so you have to have it
[57:50] in your mind first that's right can't
[57:53] bypass it just don't let it stick there
[57:55] so God works through
[57:59] psychology when he comes and he speaks
[58:02] to you and he speaks a word to you and
[58:04] it comes into your
[58:07] mind that is he is using psychology when
[58:10] the Holy Spirit was anointing the
[58:12] prophet and he spoke he says oh yes I
[58:16] see you have this and this and this and
[58:18] issue there's nothing wrong with you but
[58:21] somebody said something to you and you
[58:22] started believing something in your head
[58:24] so then this is what's manifesting on
[58:25] your
[58:26] flesh every one of those
[58:29] interactions was could be interpreted as
[58:32] a moment in the psychiatrist's
[58:34] office the devil can't create that's
[58:38] right he can only
[58:41] pervert so the psychology of the world
[58:44] has
[58:45] perverted the Clear Vision of the mind
[58:48] that God has in his word amen that's it
[58:51] because where is the greatest battle
[58:53] ever fought
[58:55] in your mind so should you have a weak
[58:58] mind no and if you have a weak mind it's
[59:01] your own
[59:04] fault but we get carried away because by
[59:07] around preaches against psychology
[59:09] there's 43 mentions of the word
[59:11] psychology in the message as far as the
[59:13] table is concerned on the search 403
[59:15] times most of those are him preaching
[59:18] against
[59:19] psychology because he's dealing directly
[59:23] with the thought that well all of these
[59:26] signs and these wonders and and and the
[59:28] speaking and Discerning is it's just
[59:30] psychology in other words it's just you
[59:33] hypnotizing or just you reading their
[59:37] minds so psychology holds some truth in
[59:41] the confines of the word I'm preparing
[59:44] you because I'm about to read you some
[59:45] scientific things okay so I'm preparing
[59:49] you he says that's right psychology is
[59:52] but
[59:53] okay psychology is something that you're
[59:55] think of thinking of or mentally worked
[59:58] up to but the reality is God placing
[1:00:01] back in confirmation of your
[1:00:04] psychology faith is the substance of
[1:00:06] things hoped for the evidence of Things
[1:00:08] Not Seen It's actually an Evidence
[1:00:10] something positive when it's confirmed
[1:00:13] to you so it's the confirmation of your
[1:00:17] the reality of God is placing back in
[1:00:20] confirmation of your
[1:00:22] psychology Christ is identified in the
[1:00:24] same in all generations if you don't
[1:00:26] understand exactly where we are right
[1:00:27] now just hold on we'll we'll get there
[1:00:29] now we find in here some think he was a
[1:00:31] philosopher he was a philosopher there's
[1:00:34] no doubt about that but he was more than
[1:00:37] a philosopher talking about
[1:00:39] Jesus so now a few scientific and
[1:00:42] psychologist based things on emotions
[1:00:45] emotions in in our bodies and our
[1:00:48] thoughts and our mind and
[1:00:51] everything
[1:00:53] belief belief regulates
[1:01:00] emotion so the word of God now that
[1:01:02] that's from a unbeliever the word of God
[1:01:07] regulates your
[1:01:09] emotions what you believe how you
[1:01:12] identify
[1:01:14] uh he goes He further he further goes on
[1:01:17] to say functional identity regulates
[1:01:19] your emotion so who you identify as what
[1:01:22] you identify with where where you where
[1:01:25] you where you you know if you have a if
[1:01:27] you have the proper balance of of a of
[1:01:29] of a
[1:01:31] family that regulates your emotion
[1:01:33] children who are real small and their
[1:01:35] parents divorce it wounds them
[1:01:40] emotionally and so you're like we always
[1:01:43] say you're a product of your environment
[1:01:45] now God comes and he helps you overcome
[1:01:47] that okay he brings that into
[1:01:50] position in in
[1:01:52] Forbes they say this talking about
[1:01:54] emotions says first every feeling begins
[1:01:57] with an external stimulus whether it's
[1:01:59] what someone said or a physical event
[1:02:02] that stimulate stimulus generates an
[1:02:06] unfelt emotion in the brain so an
[1:02:09] outside external
[1:02:11] stimulus somebody says something or
[1:02:13] there's a physical
[1:02:15] event the then there's a stimulus that
[1:02:18] generates an unfelt emotion in the brain
[1:02:20] which causes the body to produce
[1:02:23] responsive hormon hormones these
[1:02:26] hormones enter the bloodstream and
[1:02:28] create feelings sometimes negative and
[1:02:31] sometimes positive so emotion is the
[1:02:34] last thing to come what we call emotion
[1:02:36] it's the last thing to come there is a
[1:02:38] outside stimulus an external
[1:02:41] stimulus from
[1:02:43] something so to review it's stimuli then
[1:02:46] emotions then hormones and finally
[1:02:49] feelings in other words your emotions
[1:02:52] impact this is what I'm getting down to
[1:02:53] your emot emotions impact your
[1:02:55] decisionmaking process by creating
[1:02:58] certain feelings you cannot make a
[1:03:01] decision outside of emotions as a human
[1:03:07] being that's the simplest way to put it
[1:03:10] according to another expert in the field
[1:03:12] American Portuguese neuroscientist Dr
[1:03:14] Antonio deasio the brain constantly
[1:03:17] needs to update its information on the
[1:03:20] body's state in order to regulate the
[1:03:22] many processes that keep it alive
[1:03:25] and it needs to translate those emotions
[1:03:27] into actionable feelings in an
[1:03:30] everchanging environment this is the
[1:03:32] only way an organism can
[1:03:34] survive you need your emotions to
[1:03:38] survive when brother mam said if your
[1:03:40] religion has no emotion then it's dead I
[1:03:44] wonder if he knew exactly what he was
[1:03:46] saying for an organism to
[1:03:49] survive it must adapt to an everchanging
[1:03:52] environment through emotion
[1:03:55] when you get afraid and you run your
[1:03:58] emotion just saved your
[1:04:02] life people who don't have a disconnect
[1:04:05] in their emotions jump off
[1:04:08] Bridges do crazy things we call them
[1:04:11] Psychopaths right there's a disconnect
[1:04:13] in their
[1:04:16] brain so in order for you you as because
[1:04:20] you have to remember natural always
[1:04:21] types the spiritual in order for you to
[1:04:24] survive as a spirit man as a Son of God
[1:04:26] you need
[1:04:29] emotions so what happens now in the
[1:04:32] flesh when somebody's emotions are
[1:04:35] uncontrolled we can call them bipolar we
[1:04:37] can call them psychopath different
[1:04:39] different manifestations of this but
[1:04:41] what it is it's an it's an uncontrolled
[1:04:43] there's there's something wrong with the
[1:04:45] way their brain has been
[1:04:49] wired they they are insane
[1:04:56] okay that's the the the down low harsh
[1:04:59] term of it because insane means your
[1:05:02] brain basically your brain isn't
[1:05:03] functioning properly now there's things
[1:05:05] to help with that okay if we adapt if we
[1:05:09] apply that to the
[1:05:12] flesh when emotions someone's emotions
[1:05:15] someone's as they would say psyche but
[1:05:17] that's just your spirit your your your
[1:05:19] who you are as a person I know you guys
[1:05:21] are like where is this guy going just
[1:05:23] hold on a second
[1:05:25] if you take that and we apply it to the
[1:05:27] and when someone's walking down the
[1:05:28] street talking to themsel there's
[1:05:30] something wrong with them they are not
[1:05:32] functioning like a normal human
[1:05:36] being that's on the the the the natural
[1:05:40] now let's step into the
[1:05:42] spiritual if your emotion is not in
[1:05:48] position to the word of
[1:05:52] God your out of position that's
[1:05:56] right so does that mean we we we just
[1:05:59] clamp down on all emotion no absolutely
[1:06:04] not it means we put emotion in its place
[1:06:08] that's
[1:06:09] right as a son and daughter of God you
[1:06:11] have absolute
[1:06:15] control because you have the word that's
[1:06:18] right now if you try to if you try to
[1:06:22] control your yourself or you or you
[1:06:25] tried to work something up I wish there
[1:06:28] was a better word somebody got a
[1:06:30] Theus if you try to to
[1:06:33] manufacture think about someone who who
[1:06:35] fakes a smile it's all over them you can
[1:06:38] tell they're Faking It how do you know
[1:06:41] that because you're a human being and
[1:06:42] you have emotions too and you connect
[1:06:43] and you see that so when you're Faking
[1:06:45] It spiritually your emotions out of
[1:06:50] position I lost my train of
[1:06:53] thought maybe the Lord wanted Miss to
[1:06:55] turn a different
[1:06:57] Corner if you if you get out of the
[1:07:00] simplest way to put it is if you get out
[1:07:02] of your positions you try to you try to
[1:07:05] fake that's what I was talking about
[1:07:06] faking a smile faking an emotion someone
[1:07:08] someone who's acting acting an emotion
[1:07:11] out an actor whatever they're doing when
[1:07:14] they're acting all that is emotion right
[1:07:17] they have to they have to learn to
[1:07:18] manipulate their emotions to match what
[1:07:20] they're acting for the common for most
[1:07:23] of us we're convinced for the most
[1:07:25] part
[1:07:27] but if if spiritually you you you put so
[1:07:33] they're putting the emotion
[1:07:36] first they're not actually feeling what
[1:07:38] they're
[1:07:40] acting they're not actually that's not
[1:07:42] who they
[1:07:43] are they have they have they have
[1:07:46] projected something that they are not
[1:07:50] they put the emotion they put the the
[1:07:52] God gave us responses in our fa and
[1:07:54] muscles in our faces and and how we we
[1:07:56] respond and how we to be
[1:07:59] genuine but when we project you know
[1:08:02] what we're doing we're putting emotions
[1:08:04] before we're putting emotion before the
[1:08:08] actual
[1:08:10] experience naturally
[1:08:12] speaking so when you fake try to fake it
[1:08:14] you're reaching for the emotion without
[1:08:17] ever knowing the experience right
[1:08:20] exactly you're you're you're you're
[1:08:22] trying to be excited about something
[1:08:23] you're not actually excited about right
[1:08:26] so you flip the way you were designed to
[1:08:30] function that's in the natural now in
[1:08:32] the spiritual if you reach for the
[1:08:35] emotion you reach for the
[1:08:37] response before you get the message
[1:08:41] that's
[1:08:42] right you're emotionally unstable yeah
[1:08:45] that's right so if you reach out and you
[1:08:47] say I I H I want to act like this you're
[1:08:52] putting the cart before the horse
[1:08:56] right but you see where where where the
[1:08:59] Trap is is emotion is important that's
[1:09:03] it so we can't get rid of it we can't
[1:09:07] clamp down on it if if we see our lives
[1:09:10] and we we're dry we don't reach for
[1:09:12] emotion we reach for the word
[1:09:16] amen if if if our church and you look
[1:09:19] and you say for example I'm not saying
[1:09:21] this is the truth for example you look
[1:09:23] around at your church and you say wow
[1:09:25] it's
[1:09:25] dry do you reach for better music do you
[1:09:28] reach for an external
[1:09:31] stimuli to prop your emotion up to where
[1:09:34] it should be right or do you reach for
[1:09:36] the word of God that's it do you reach
[1:09:39] for the thing you know if I gave you a
[1:09:40] million bucks you'd be way more excited
[1:09:42] than if I asked you to fake I gave you a
[1:09:44] million
[1:09:45] bucks yeah
[1:09:47] right but we we want we want that I
[1:09:52] think you understand what I'm saying we
[1:09:53] want that emotional expression because
[1:09:56] because we see in the word David
[1:09:58] danced the the clothing fire tongues of
[1:10:01] fire came down they spoke in tongues
[1:10:02] there was a manifestation many by the
[1:10:04] way it says many spoke with tongu not
[1:10:06] all of them doesn't say they all did it
[1:10:08] says many
[1:10:11] but if we reach for that that's why Paul
[1:10:14] said that's why Paul said There came I
[1:10:17] I'm terrible at reiterating this part
[1:10:20] that Paul talks about but basically
[1:10:22] you're reaching for the and you're
[1:10:24] reaching for these
[1:10:25] manifestations without the thing that
[1:10:27] produces them right that's the problem
[1:10:31] the emotion is not the problem the
[1:10:34] problem is you reach for that without
[1:10:36] what actually brings
[1:10:37] it so your emotion isn't in its position
[1:10:40] it's out here and it's pulling you
[1:10:42] along okay but we're human beings an
[1:10:45] external
[1:10:47] stimuli external stimuli right produces
[1:10:51] that that's why right what you listen
[1:10:53] listen to matters that's right that's
[1:10:55] why what you feed on matters have you
[1:10:57] ever watched a movie without any music
[1:10:59] I'm not going to get on music I'm just
[1:11:00] saying have you ever watch the movie no
[1:11:02] because why it brings the emotion of
[1:11:04] what's Happening that's right if if if
[1:11:07] if somebody's you know sneaking through
[1:11:08] the woods hiding from the whatever you
[1:11:10] know maybe it's a documentary or
[1:11:12] something I don't know this is always a
[1:11:13] sketchy place to venture when you're
[1:11:14] preaching but some something's happening
[1:11:17] that's that's SC that's scary dangerous
[1:11:19] they don't play you know oh to
[1:11:22] Joy
[1:11:26] they play something to match the
[1:11:27] experience so that is why music has a
[1:11:30] place in our worship we have to have it
[1:11:32] David played the har and what happened
[1:11:35] an insane Man became sane who didn't
[1:11:37] even have the spirit of God so there's
[1:11:40] power in that so
[1:11:42] emotion has its
[1:11:44] position in an everchanging environment
[1:11:47] this is the only way an organism can
[1:11:49] survive that's right that's Dr deasio
[1:11:52] and be not AF afraid he says you know
[1:11:55] there's something about when you go to
[1:11:56] tell about the goodness of God you get
[1:11:58] all excited you know emotional someone
[1:12:02] says I don't believe in emotional
[1:12:04] religion well you better bury what
[1:12:05] you've got then that's right so if your
[1:12:08] religion hasn't got a little emotion in
[1:12:09] it you better bury the thing that's
[1:12:11] right and they must the The Old Ship
[1:12:14] must have been rocking around pretty
[1:12:15] good when they all got to testifying
[1:12:17] talking about John begins to testify in
[1:12:19] the boat while they're going across the
[1:12:21] sea before the storm and it must have
[1:12:23] been Andrew then just couldn't hold it
[1:12:25] any longer said Brethren just a minute
[1:12:26] we all remember down at saciar that day
[1:12:28] how he sent us into the city to buy some
[1:12:30] food and wanted to be left alone over in
[1:12:32] that country okay sometimes I have extra
[1:12:36] parts of the quote but I just wanted to
[1:12:37] get to the point where he says I uh you
[1:12:40] get all excited you you know emotional
[1:12:42] someone says I don't believe in
[1:12:42] emotional Rel religion well you better
[1:12:44] bury what you've got now he he he's
[1:12:47] saying your religion should
[1:12:49] produce that not not you not you going
[1:12:54] and producing it because it has a
[1:12:56] position in The Sixth Seal he says
[1:12:59] Christ stands ready with outstretched
[1:13:01] arm to receive you in one hour from now
[1:13:05] that Mercy might not be extended to you
[1:13:07] you might turn it away for the last time
[1:13:09] it'll never touch your heart again he's
[1:13:11] it's down towards the end of the service
[1:13:12] and the spirit of the Lord is moving he
[1:13:14] says while you can why don't you do it I
[1:13:17] know the regular customary way is bring
[1:13:19] people up to the altar we do that and
[1:13:21] that's perfectly all right at this time
[1:13:23] we're such crowded in here right around
[1:13:25] the altar till I couldn't do that but
[1:13:28] I'd like to say this in the apostolic
[1:13:29] day they say as many as believe were
[1:13:32] baptized see just if you can really down
[1:13:35] in your heart here is all it
[1:13:37] is here is all it is it is an emotion
[1:13:41] though emotion accompanies
[1:13:44] it you know symbols accompany an
[1:13:47] orchestra piece that's right but if we
[1:13:50] just had the symbols nobody would listen
[1:13:53] right right that's right there is no
[1:13:54] Beauty in just symbols
[1:13:57] clinging coincidentally 1 Corinthians 13
[1:14:00] says I am but a clinging symbol without
[1:14:03] Divine love that's right some words you
[1:14:06] get the cart before the horse you get
[1:14:07] the emotion before Christ right that's
[1:14:12] right though emotion accompanies it just
[1:14:15] like what I said smoking and drinking
[1:14:16] isn't sin it's the attribute of sin it
[1:14:20] shows you don't believe see but when you
[1:14:22] truly believe in your heart you know
[1:14:24] that on the basis of where you're
[1:14:26] sitting there you accept it with all
[1:14:27] your heart something is going to happen
[1:14:29] right there it's going to happen then
[1:14:31] you can stand as a witness to it that
[1:14:34] something happened then you can stand as
[1:14:37] a witness to it exct sometimes that's
[1:14:40] jumping up and shouting that's right
[1:14:42] because something pushed out some you
[1:14:45] were genuinely excited about
[1:14:48] something but it it came the stimuli
[1:14:52] came from the new one
[1:14:53] all these are drunk on new wine well
[1:14:56] that's why I said they're kind of right
[1:14:59] the word of God the new
[1:15:02] wine second-handed robe Heavenly Father
[1:15:05] whatever this woman is in need of if
[1:15:07] Satan has bound her we through the name
[1:15:09] of Jesus Christ take the initiative and
[1:15:11] ask for him to leave this woman and be
[1:15:13] cast out in the name of Jesus Christ
[1:15:15] amen now go rejoicing being happy lady
[1:15:17] all right lady now that ought to settle
[1:15:20] it that ought to settle it that you
[1:15:21] believe on the Lord Jesus Christ if the
[1:15:23] bble said you say oh she's
[1:15:25] emotionally probably if you was healed
[1:15:28] of the same thing you'd be a little
[1:15:29] emotional
[1:15:31] too you see but you can't
[1:15:33] say you can't what we do is we'll look
[1:15:36] at that as human as as humans because
[1:15:40] we're emotional
[1:15:42] creatures and we say we we we emphasis
[1:15:45] on the emotion because that's what we
[1:15:47] see y that's right that's what we see
[1:15:50] that's it you know somebody you that's
[1:15:52] why that's why in ads right they play on
[1:15:56] your emotions that's right if we if that
[1:15:59] didn't matter to us they wouldn't do
[1:16:01] that but if they want to sell you a a
[1:16:04] drug they show the old guy you know it's
[1:16:06] might be black and white and he's wishes
[1:16:08] he could play with his grandkid and then
[1:16:10] and then he takes a drug and he's
[1:16:11] running with his grandkid why there's a
[1:16:13] lot of emotions in that one minute ad
[1:16:17] and we say that we our brains we can't
[1:16:21] help it our brain say that drug will
[1:16:24] make me happy like that guy so when we
[1:16:27] see the
[1:16:29] healing you see we get the heart before
[1:16:31] the horse sometimes we think oh we have
[1:16:33] to act like that that's that's exactly
[1:16:36] that we want that so
[1:16:38] we but if we're not careful we go and we
[1:16:40] get something and we don't act like that
[1:16:42] then we think we missed it that's right
[1:16:44] right right you see what I'm saying if
[1:16:46] you if you play the commercial and you
[1:16:48] play the and you if you if you play the
[1:16:50] word as a commercial then now everyone
[1:16:55] has to act like this cuz they got this
[1:16:57] and you get this and you don't act like
[1:16:59] this you go back thinking you didn't get
[1:17:02] it that makes sense that's right I
[1:17:05] actually believe because natural always
[1:17:06] have to spiritual there's a big movement
[1:17:08] as as kind of interesting situation but
[1:17:11] that they think hey stop putting perfect
[1:17:13] people to model clothing you know you're
[1:17:15] leaving people out you're not being
[1:17:17] inclusive of different body types okay
[1:17:19] you understand I don't need to go into
[1:17:20] details so now you have different body
[1:17:22] types
[1:17:24] we would say they just need less
[1:17:25] calories but they say they're different
[1:17:27] body
[1:17:30] types that's right so there's a little
[1:17:34] bit of Truth there because it's
[1:17:36] reality so you see that you say oh if I
[1:17:39] am like that it's going to fit me like
[1:17:41] that maybe I don't want
[1:17:44] that right because it's real so if you
[1:17:47] always promote this this this this
[1:17:49] manifestation of the emotion if you
[1:17:51] always promote this you put put emotions
[1:17:53] out of the position now I already said
[1:17:55] it I'm not going to repeat myself I'm
[1:17:57] not going to waste your time so you
[1:18:00] understand what what I'm
[1:18:01] saying so he says you'd be a little
[1:18:03] emotional too if you got healed but you
[1:18:06] know what sometimes look God completely
[1:18:08] healed me of all these allergies that I
[1:18:11] had I never ran I didn't run I didn't
[1:18:13] run the aisles I was really really happy
[1:18:16] though really really thankful though so
[1:18:18] does that mean I missed my
[1:18:20] healing you see that sometimes when
[1:18:22] people share testimonies they want you
[1:18:24] to react the way they did that's it you
[1:18:28] see we're trying to we're trying to
[1:18:30] we're trying to get somewhere with
[1:18:31] something but we're we're getting
[1:18:32] somewhere with the wrong thing that's
[1:18:34] right I hope that made sense emotion
[1:18:37] follows the manifestation of the word
[1:18:39] these signs shall follow them that
[1:18:41] believe now when we talk about the signs
[1:18:43] and we talking speaking in tongues
[1:18:44] that's a little bit different than the
[1:18:46] actual emotions but it's a kind of
[1:18:48] lumped together sometimes but it it it I
[1:18:51] brought that scripture it in in Mark be
[1:18:54] in Mark 16 says go into all the world
[1:18:56] preach the gospel and these signs shall
[1:18:58] follow them that believe so guess what
[1:19:02] they're here right in our
[1:19:04] church and sometimes we miss them God
[1:19:07] didn't say you will see everyone right
[1:19:11] he just said they'll be there and you
[1:19:12] start that's why testimony is so
[1:19:14] important brother BR says make sure you
[1:19:17] actually have a testimony so but
[1:19:19] testimony is very important to testify
[1:19:21] what God's doing in your life because
[1:19:23] then you are telling me telling the rest
[1:19:26] of the brothers and sisters what God did
[1:19:28] for you we're seeing God In Action
[1:19:30] that's right you see so it's really
[1:19:32] important it's really important I I'm
[1:19:35] reading a book about about about uh just
[1:19:38] it's called the insanity of God and it's
[1:19:39] just this guy who's denominational
[1:19:41] creature uh creature preacher but he's
[1:19:43] been went all over the world to these
[1:19:45] places that are are just under uh
[1:19:47] intense uh religious persecution and he
[1:19:50] noticed the difference between the
[1:19:51] church in America and the church for
[1:19:53] example where I'm at right now in the
[1:19:54] book in China he said what would people
[1:19:57] tell if I could stop somebody on the
[1:19:59] street because they were still
[1:20:00] underneath you know communist Rule and
[1:20:01] stuff and persecuted which I think they
[1:20:03] still are and I could ask them and I
[1:20:05] could tell Point At You guys and say who
[1:20:08] are those people what would their
[1:20:10] response be and the Chinese Believers
[1:20:12] were instant they said they would say
[1:20:13] those are the people who raised the
[1:20:16] dead so God uses
[1:20:19] that God uses these signs God uses these
[1:20:22] miracles
[1:20:23] to testify of his presence that's right
[1:20:26] to testify of his
[1:20:28] Blessing but those
[1:20:31] come so those happen let's say for
[1:20:33] example those happen and those attract
[1:20:35] you then you receive the word and you
[1:20:37] say wow this is that word this is truth
[1:20:39] because nobody else has this going on so
[1:20:41] now you take the word now you grow now
[1:20:43] as you grow up in up unto adoption now
[1:20:46] you begin to manifest those things but
[1:20:49] if you jump right off the ship right
[1:20:51] there and try to go manifest in those
[1:20:53] things you won't that's right you'll
[1:20:56] have to fake it you have to grow it it
[1:21:00] it's something that follows your growth
[1:21:02] right kind of like you know Jackson and
[1:21:04] Abe right they want to be big and strong
[1:21:07] they can't be yet they physically can't
[1:21:10] be they have to grow their body has to
[1:21:13] grow so they become teenagers and adults
[1:21:16] and then now they can begin to Fashion
[1:21:18] the muscles that we would say is
[1:21:21] strong
[1:21:23] so you can't when you're 5 years old
[1:21:25] spiritually speaking you can't lift 450
[1:21:29] lbs spiritually
[1:21:32] speaking you have to journey to that
[1:21:34] position you have to Journey there
[1:21:37] Israel couldn't just walk out of Egypt
[1:21:40] straight into the promised land they had
[1:21:42] a journey to make to get
[1:21:46] there but we want
[1:21:50] instant we look around we say wow
[1:21:52] where's all all the Miracles and what do
[1:21:53] we start to preach we start to preach
[1:21:56] Miracles that's not what brings the
[1:21:58] Miracles what brings the Miracles is the
[1:22:00] word preaching the word because what
[1:22:03] increases your faith somebody say it
[1:22:06] hearing amen not hearing
[1:22:12] about careful we don't want to get off
[1:22:15] balance Hebrews chapter 6 now don't
[1:22:18] think wrong that I do not believe in
[1:22:20] these emotions certainly but what we're
[1:22:22] on now trying to drill to this people of
[1:22:24] this day is not emotions so they have
[1:22:27] their position but they're not the point
[1:22:30] the devil has has took those things and
[1:22:33] went wild with the people letting them
[1:22:35] base their Eternal destination upon an
[1:22:38] emotion shouting speaking with tongue
[1:22:41] going to church every Sunday acting like
[1:22:43] a Christian that won't have one bearing
[1:22:45] at that day except a man is born again
[1:22:49] and your life reflects what you are on
[1:22:51] the inside see not not your emotions so
[1:22:55] emotions accompany it but you can't use
[1:22:57] it as the verifier that's
[1:23:02] right Gideon well he has his license
[1:23:05] Titus do you have your license you're
[1:23:08] old enough okay Gideon might be able to
[1:23:10] drive really really well I don't know
[1:23:11] drives a dirt bike okay let's say he
[1:23:14] does he get in my car he could take out
[1:23:16] down the road just perfectly change
[1:23:19] lanes put the blinker on everything but
[1:23:21] he's not verified to drive
[1:23:24] he needs the proof that's right and
[1:23:27] that's all that will stand in court
[1:23:29] that's all that will stand against the
[1:23:31] Judgment so when the word if you if
[1:23:34] you're driving around without your
[1:23:35] license you're manifest manifesting the
[1:23:38] position of a driver right but when when
[1:23:41] when when the word when the when the
[1:23:43] judge when the when when the the law of
[1:23:46] the of the city which is the the
[1:23:48] absolute in that
[1:23:50] thing uh calls to question your position
[1:23:54] you have no proof that's right the devil
[1:23:57] calls you to your calls your position to
[1:24:01] question every day of your life that's
[1:24:04] right and if you don't have the
[1:24:08] proof he's got
[1:24:11] you you can drive like the best driver
[1:24:15] there is you could even get in a semi
[1:24:17] shift it drive it everything you want
[1:24:20] complicated I mean I don't know how many
[1:24:21] gears they can get up to but I've heard
[1:24:22] it's a lot you can pull you know Triple
[1:24:26] Three FedEx right you see those going
[1:24:27] down the freeway you could be the best
[1:24:29] of that but if you don't have a CDL if
[1:24:30] you don't have proof of your position if
[1:24:33] you're not
[1:24:35] verified and they call to
[1:24:39] question you have nothing that's right
[1:24:43] if you if you express as if you express
[1:24:47] Express a being a
[1:24:50] Christian and you don't have the token
[1:24:53] that's it that's right and the devil
[1:24:56] calls you to question that's
[1:24:58] right he's got you dead to
[1:25:04] rights he
[1:25:06] says shouting speaking with tongue going
[1:25:08] to church every Sunday acting like a
[1:25:11] Christian that won't have one bearing at
[1:25:13] that day that's right except the man is
[1:25:15] born again and your life reflects what
[1:25:18] you are on the inside see not your
[1:25:21] emotion
[1:25:24] you could have blood in your hands you
[1:25:26] could speak with tongues you could heal
[1:25:27] the sick you could move mountains with
[1:25:29] your faith you are nothing yet 1
[1:25:32] Corinthians 13 see it's got to be
[1:25:33] something happened by a birth which
[1:25:36] comes from God and God brings the new
[1:25:38] birth into you and gives you a part of
[1:25:41] himself then those things are then those
[1:25:44] things are that's right you are a new
[1:25:47] creation I give unto them Eternal we
[1:25:50] went through the word Eternal for
[1:25:52] forever is a space of time let me make
[1:25:54] sure I need to read the rest of
[1:25:57] this eternity is forever forever and
[1:25:59] forever but there's only one eternity
[1:26:02] and we find out that you receive eternal
[1:26:04] life the word in the Greek is Zoey which
[1:26:06] means God's life and you re receive part
[1:26:10] of God's life which makes you a
[1:26:11] spiritual Son of God you're just as
[1:26:14] Everlasting as God is Everlasting you
[1:26:17] have no end no place to stop because you
[1:26:20] had no place to begin anything has a
[1:26:23] beginning has an end and that without a
[1:26:25] beginning has no
[1:26:32] end so if you're concerned with your
[1:26:34] emotional
[1:26:38] position go to the word that's
[1:26:44] right go back to the
[1:26:48] word the when you come to church it is
[1:26:51] not our job
[1:26:53] it is not our job I have to be careful
[1:26:56] I'm not going to say it never mind I'm
[1:26:57] not going to say it there's the reason
[1:27:00] something this is blind B that's the
[1:27:01] reason something was fixing to happen
[1:27:03] that's the reason those things was on
[1:27:04] his mind that's why you're here tonight
[1:27:06] your emotions has been
[1:27:08] stirred you're Bible readers you believe
[1:27:10] in these things that's what's brought
[1:27:12] you here tonight that's what makes the
[1:27:15] people stand outside of the windows
[1:27:16] looking in that's what makes the people
[1:27:18] stand in the aisle ways emotions
[1:27:21] something has third you see it was a
[1:27:23] response to something stirring that's
[1:27:26] right so you can't stop right there and
[1:27:28] say see it's emotion no something
[1:27:31] stirred your emotions something came
[1:27:34] inside this external stimuli cave and
[1:27:36] produced something inside of you that
[1:27:38] compelled you to go and you say well I
[1:27:41] just I just felt to go that's why we
[1:27:42] always say that we can't we we're human
[1:27:44] beings we're finite right is that the
[1:27:46] right word
[1:27:48] night we we we we something compels so
[1:27:51] we we Des describe it as our feelings
[1:27:53] but it was something inside of us that
[1:27:56] pushed us that that that that stirred
[1:27:58] our emotions we responded to that
[1:28:01] something has stirred there has to be
[1:28:02] something to create that emotion just
[1:28:03] the same as it was then the captain of
[1:28:05] the host of the Lord just was just
[1:28:07] inside the wall having dinner with the
[1:28:08] man we were speaking of this morning
[1:28:11] zakus after a while he says well I'm not
[1:28:14] doing very good here so I guess I'll
[1:28:15] just get up and all at once he hears a
[1:28:17] noise okay something happening a great
[1:28:20] racket usually there is a little noise
[1:28:22] around where Jesus is why because Jesus
[1:28:25] is there and he's producing the noise
[1:28:28] you don't bring the noise and then
[1:28:29] expect Jesus to come Jesus says never
[1:28:34] mind you understand always bringing it
[1:28:37] back to the balance emotion doesn't
[1:28:39] change you those are my words hear his
[1:28:42] voice 1958 how many of you love him with
[1:28:44] all your heart all your heart now in
[1:28:46] these little places here like this I'm
[1:28:48] I'm just late but the Bible said that we
[1:28:50] sit together in Heavenly places in
[1:28:51] Christ Christ Jesus the Holy Spirit
[1:28:53] comes gets into the word moves down
[1:28:55] through the audience and you can just
[1:28:57] watch it when it sweeps over them
[1:28:58] changing them as I have said I believe
[1:29:01] in emotions sure see emotion doesn't
[1:29:04] change you emotions has got to go plum
[1:29:07] in until it touches the morals of your
[1:29:09] being that's what changes you what is a
[1:29:12] sinner an unbeliever there's many a
[1:29:14] person today with a bachelor of art
[1:29:16] degree with a doctor's degree with a PhD
[1:29:18] and lld on their name and still Sinners
[1:29:20] knows the Bible from Genesis Revelations
[1:29:22] preaches in the pulpit and still
[1:29:25] disbelievers marriage of the Lamb people
[1:29:28] we've got to stand that we must do it
[1:29:30] it's just got to be done so it's not
[1:29:31] emotion emotion goes with it of course
[1:29:34] that's right but the thing of it is is a
[1:29:37] consecrated heart just take the word of
[1:29:39] God and say God I did wrong I'm sorry I
[1:29:41] did that see I told you it was going to
[1:29:43] sound like I was
[1:29:44] contradicting you just talked about how
[1:29:46] you know emotions you got to have
[1:29:48] emotions and emotions are important now
[1:29:49] brother saying look it's not emotions
[1:29:53] cuz emotions had their position can't
[1:29:55] throw the baby out with bath
[1:29:57] water so throw get the baby out of the
[1:29:59] water throw the bath water
[1:30:02] out so but the thing of it is is a
[1:30:04] consecrated heart just take the word of
[1:30:06] God say God I did wrong I'm sorry I did
[1:30:08] that you know my heart I did wrong right
[1:30:10] here upon this ground I confess my wrong
[1:30:11] and from this night hence forth I am
[1:30:13] engaged to you I'm part of the Bride
[1:30:15] I'll never do it
[1:30:17] again he says then you're I'll take you
[1:30:20] right now at your word then you're
[1:30:21] getting
[1:30:23] somewhere amen praise the
[1:30:25] Lord I believe that we
[1:30:28] have said what we should say
[1:30:31] tonight so I'm going to go back go jump
[1:30:33] to my closing in Proverbs 20 verse 20
[1:30:37] 25:20 the Bible says as he that taketh
[1:30:40] away a garment in cold water weather and
[1:30:43] as vinegar upon nitray or baking soda so
[1:30:47] is he that singeth songs to an heavy
[1:30:50] heart
[1:30:52] you're the atmosphere around you affects
[1:30:55] your emotions yeah that's
[1:31:00] right our our our own Pastor has made
[1:31:04] given given me this bit of wisdom that
[1:31:06] is so true you can be in your study and
[1:31:09] you've created this atmosphere in your
[1:31:11] study but that night might not be the
[1:31:13] atmosphere that the congregation is set
[1:31:15] into so you come out with that and now
[1:31:20] it's different
[1:31:22] so you come and and you you listen you
[1:31:24] you feel the atmosphere of the
[1:31:26] congregation and you step into that
[1:31:27] atmosphere why because it affects your
[1:31:29] emotion see how God uses everything that
[1:31:32] he's created us to be in our for our
[1:31:34] good amen so you so if if you're sad you
[1:31:38] know it's it's best reflected in
[1:31:40] children because they're just they just
[1:31:41] they have no guile they just act and and
[1:31:46] they're sad and you put on a sad song oh
[1:31:47] they will go to
[1:31:50] tears so you're struggling and you're
[1:31:52] having a hard time so you know you hope
[1:31:55] it
[1:31:58] rains you put a slow song on you draw
[1:32:01] the shades down what are you doing
[1:32:03] you're creating an atmosphere to make
[1:32:05] you more sad play a heavy song sing sing
[1:32:09] a songs to a heavy heart what he's
[1:32:12] saying look go lift them up yeah right
[1:32:15] the only point I'm making is that the
[1:32:17] atmosphere really affects your emotions
[1:32:19] and your emotions affect your decision
[1:32:21] making right
[1:32:22] amen that is why it's so important you
[1:32:25] are careful where you are that's
[1:32:31] right so if we create an atmosphere
[1:32:35] founded on the word of
[1:32:37] God in our lives in our homes in our
[1:32:41] families we're going to position our
[1:32:43] emotions in the
[1:32:45] word that's
[1:32:49] right some people have favorite
[1:32:52] preachers because they have a way to to
[1:33:00] to people let me put this way people
[1:33:03] prefer things that affect their emotions
[1:33:06] in a positive way
[1:33:08] right but I'm not we're not here to
[1:33:11] affect our emotions in a positive way
[1:33:13] yeah that's it we're here for our
[1:33:15] emotions to come into subjection to the
[1:33:19] word so we cannot judge like some of you
[1:33:22] are are yawning and getting a little
[1:33:24] little tired you can't judge this
[1:33:26] service you say you're just defending
[1:33:27] yourself no no I'm not I'm just trying
[1:33:28] to make a point you can't judge this
[1:33:30] service by your emotions right now go
[1:33:34] home and chew on this go home and chew
[1:33:36] on the word and Fe chew the
[1:33:39] cut and go in the word and God will do
[1:33:42] something in your life you see praise
[1:33:46] the Lord the atmosphere that's why
[1:33:48] atmosphere is so important as a believer
[1:33:52] you know it's like you're with your
[1:33:53] buddies and uh there's an atmosphere of
[1:33:56] of uh hey you know we're all tough and
[1:33:58] it but you're going to be more likely to
[1:34:00] do something really really stupid yeah
[1:34:03] than when you're on your
[1:34:04] own this goes back to the whole tribe
[1:34:07] mentality why do we do what we do
[1:34:10] sometimes in church because we're all
[1:34:11] doing it
[1:34:13] right the atmosphere but if we create
[1:34:15] the atmosphere now look there's
[1:34:18] similarities because the devil cannot
[1:34:20] create he only can pervert so if we
[1:34:23] create an atmosphere based on the word
[1:34:25] of God everything comes into order
[1:34:28] that's right if we atmosphere based on
[1:34:30] the word of God in our homes in our
[1:34:32] lives everything comes to order that's
[1:34:34] why it's important what you watch you
[1:34:36] ever watch something that was good that
[1:34:37] was just so gripping for me it takes me
[1:34:40] a few hours to to realize I'm not that
[1:34:43] person that just died on the side of the
[1:34:45] mountain cuz it grips you
[1:34:48] emotionally but you can't serve God that
[1:34:51] way you you can't you can't you can't
[1:34:52] read the Bible and and and say I have to
[1:34:55] have this emotion this certain emotion
[1:34:57] because you will be ruled by that that's
[1:34:59] right amen because it's out of its
[1:35:02] position okay in the Supernatural 1956
[1:35:06] in
[1:35:07] closing resist you want to come go over
[1:35:09] and say we're going to a dance one man
[1:35:11] standing up saying well now he do know
[1:35:13] about whether he wants to dance or not
[1:35:15] and this girl over over and she's this
[1:35:18] that and the music's playing near my God
[1:35:20] to thee huh what atmosphere for a
[1:35:23] dance he says well that's not any
[1:35:25] different than what a lot of atmospheres
[1:35:27] you go into church for a service of God
[1:35:30] just that contrary I think he's
[1:35:32] referring to the story where he stops
[1:35:34] the dance they're about to go into a
[1:35:36] dance and he and he I think that's what
[1:35:37] it is but you go back and check it just
[1:35:39] that contrary right the only thing to
[1:35:41] bring the right atmosphere then for the
[1:35:42] dance is to put on their old music that
[1:35:44] makes dance and everybody get thinking
[1:35:47] about thinking what a good time they're
[1:35:48] going to have dancing and so forth and
[1:35:50] they'll be having a big hoop up in time
[1:35:54] put the right kind of music on the piano
[1:35:55] the organ and everybody in the
[1:35:57] atmosphere that Jesus Christ is there
[1:35:59] going to meet everything they have need
[1:36:02] of something will go to taking place
[1:36:06] atmosphere but that's the hardest thing
[1:36:08] there is there is to do and that is to
[1:36:11] get people in that atmosphere the
[1:36:14] atmosphere of worship the atmosphere of
[1:36:17] believing that's right so I hope you
[1:36:19] have you can see by this point why the
[1:36:21] atmosphere is so important because you
[1:36:23] as a human being have emotions right and
[1:36:27] the atmosphere affects because by
[1:36:30] definition from science it's an external
[1:36:32] stimuli something someone says or an
[1:36:36] event so the right
[1:36:39] atmosphere positionally places your
[1:36:42] emotions on the word of God and if your
[1:36:47] emotions are St stabilized by The Rock
[1:36:50] which is the revelation of Jesus
[1:36:52] Christ you're going to make good
[1:36:55] decisions you're going to make good
[1:36:57] decisions in your life you're going to
[1:36:59] make good decisions at home that's why
[1:37:01] it's super important if if you're having
[1:37:02] altercation with your children you get
[1:37:04] worked up take a break because your
[1:37:07] emotions are out of position that's
[1:37:10] right so we're in the house of God when
[1:37:12] we come let's come and create such an
[1:37:15] atmosphere that everything is grounded
[1:37:18] upon the word of God we come with our
[1:37:20] lives we come pray up you can be you can
[1:37:22] be struggling you can be having a hard
[1:37:24] time but you're in the right
[1:37:28] atmosphere there's times where
[1:37:30] emotionally I'm really
[1:37:32] struggling but I'm in the right
[1:37:34] atmosphere that's right and through that
[1:37:37] God brings Clarity that's right and God
[1:37:41] is not the author of confusion oh that's
[1:37:43] right let's pray Heavenly Father Lord
[1:37:46] Jesus pray that thank you for your word
[1:37:49] tonight Lord Jesus kind kind of hit here
[1:37:52] here and there and maybe a little bit
[1:37:54] disc confabulated at some points but I
[1:37:55] just pray it all have been done to your
[1:37:57] glory for your honor not my opinions I'm
[1:38:01] not trying to to to LIF to prop my
[1:38:03] opinion up I don't want to do that I
[1:38:04] want your word to come and just speak to
[1:38:06] our hearts Lord speak to my heart give
[1:38:08] me greater Clarity Lord help us father
[1:38:10] to be to be the author of our
[1:38:12] atmospheres to take it more seriously
[1:38:14] that that father we could be positioned
[1:38:16] emot put our emotions in their proper
[1:38:19] position so we can have Clarity in Our
[1:38:21] Lives Lord Jesus it's not psychology we
[1:38:24] can't even do that without your
[1:38:26] leading We cannot put ourselves in the
[1:38:29] at right atmosphere without your leading
[1:38:31] because the devil hates Your
[1:38:33] Atmosphere so the flesh is going to pull
[1:38:35] the wrong direction but God it's your
[1:38:38] Holy Spirit in us that says no I won't
[1:38:41] accept
[1:38:42] that we bring ourselves in the right
[1:38:44] atmosphere God we bring things into that
[1:38:47] order that atmosphere in our church it's
[1:38:50] scriptural Lord that we'll see the
[1:38:52] healings and we'll see the expressions
[1:38:54] of of Deliverance in people's life why
[1:38:56] because the atmosphere of God has the
[1:38:59] power to move
[1:39:01] mountains because you are present and
[1:39:06] you are that God you are the I am so
[1:39:09] Lord may you just help us Lord to to
[1:39:11] remember every day every day of our
[1:39:15] lives every every moment we have to to
[1:39:17] to to make sure we are positioning
[1:39:20] ourselves in the right atmosphere we are
[1:39:22] positioning ourselves on your word we
[1:39:25] ask in Jesus Christ's name we pray amen
