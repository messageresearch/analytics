[45:17] another few weeks for the uh you know I
[45:19] can't say that while you guys were
[45:21] freezing here I was standing on the
[45:24] beach in El Salvador at 90 degrees
[45:26] holding services and boy I didn't know
[45:29] you know you get in that country and you
[45:31] like I think of Nicaragua and it's when
[45:34] you get heat there's also that it's wet
[45:36] and sticky and I didn't know El Salvador
[45:39] has a dry season it felt
[45:43] wonderful and I was you know looking at
[45:45] the phone going the weather reports and
[45:48] it's snowing and blowing and zeros
[45:51] and I'm going Lord thank you say really
[45:57] nice but uh Wow since last time we were
[46:00] here we've been to Honduras uh New
[46:04] Finland El Salvador Texas
[46:08] Florida back out to Oregon and uh I tell
[46:12] people I can't say it keeps me off the
[46:15] streets but I'd like to think it keeps
[46:17] me out of trouble so so God bless you
[46:20] this morning I'm glad to be here
[46:22] greetings from my family I have one
[46:23] correction I I I think I told my son uh
[46:27] Jackson Mississippi actually that little
[46:30] sister I prayed with there is from Foley
[46:33] Alabama and I'm not sure she would like
[46:35] being associated with
[46:37] Mississippi so excuse us for that
[46:41] error error corrected so just not to
[46:45] make you stand again but just from
[46:46] respect for the word if we could stand
[46:48] for just a moment am God bless the
[46:51] visitors with us this
[46:52] morning we pray that the Lord would
[46:56] Grant you something for strength and
[46:58] courage in these late hour in which we
[47:01] live so we'll start with some very
[47:03] familiar
[47:05] scriptures in Genesis first chapter
[47:07] first few verses there uh and I know
[47:11] pretty much everyone will be familiar
[47:15] with
[47:16] this says in the beginning God created
[47:19] the Heaven and the Earth Earth was
[47:22] without form and the were and void and
[47:25] dark dark Ness was upon the face of the
[47:27] deep the spirit of God moved upon the
[47:29] face of the waters and God said let
[47:32] there be light and there was light and
[47:35] then in John the first
[47:41] chapter
[47:45] says here page is
[47:49] flipping we'll read just a couple of
[47:52] verses
[47:54] there
[47:56] in the beginning was the word the word
[47:58] was with God the Word was God the same
[48:01] was in the beginning with God all things
[48:03] were made by him and without him was not
[48:06] anything made that was made and in him
[48:09] was life and the life was the light of
[48:12] men and we'll drop down to the 12th
[48:15] verse but as many as received him to
[48:19] them gave he power to become the sons of
[48:21] God even to them that believe on his
[48:24] name amen gracious Heavenly Father we've
[48:27] read a portion of your word this morning
[48:29] may it become part of our Lives as we
[48:32] commit this service to you in the holy
[48:35] and mighty name of Jesus Christ amen
[48:38] please be seated and thank
[48:42] you as and I suppose we've done this
[48:47] here before but for the sake of the
[48:48] visitors I view the gospel similar to
[48:52] this I've already drank some of it but
[48:55] it's it's water and it's in a
[48:58] bottle and a lot of the word of God as
[49:01] we read
[49:03] it it's what they call transitive and it
[49:06] simply just means to move from one
[49:08] position to another it's where we get
[49:10] the words Transportation transport uh
[49:14] and so when we think of the Gospel as
[49:16] being transitive it means it's
[49:19] moving and it's moving
[49:22] continuously even as we're speaking now
[49:25] because it's moving not just from the
[49:27] pages of the book but it's moving from
[49:30] those pages through my heart through my
[49:32] life through the spirit that God put in
[49:34] me and and by his holy spirit it's
[49:37] moving into your ears and your hearts as
[49:40] as you receive it and so the gospel's
[49:43] always moving and if we think of it as
[49:46] not just moving it place to place but
[49:49] inside this is water and human beings
[49:53] can't live without water and so
[49:58] H I'm drinking it where did it go
[50:03] well the water
[50:05] moved it became
[50:08] transitive not just from the bottle from
[50:10] one place to another but it became
[50:12] transitive to well where did it go it
[50:14] became part of me
[50:17] amen that
[50:19] water became a part of me and as we
[50:23] drink the
[50:24] water
[50:27] it becomes part of us Jesus said I give
[50:29] you water you'll never thirst
[50:31] again so we know but there's something
[50:34] else that we don't really see when I
[50:37] drank the water for human beings we
[50:39] can't exist without water we're I guess
[50:41] it's 90 some per water so there's life
[50:45] for us in this water that's right
[50:49] there's life for us in this water and so
[50:52] it is spiritually there's life amen in
[50:56] here but we have to move it I had to
[50:59] move it from the bottle if it just sat
[51:00] there in a bottle and I'm out on the
[51:03] desert you know hold my throat it does
[51:05] me no good I have to move the water from
[51:09] the bottle into the body amen and so it
[51:13] is with the Gospel of Jesus Christ it
[51:16] has to be moved from these Pages that's
[51:20] right and be moved into you know through
[51:22] these eyes through these ears through
[51:24] this right but even beyond that into the
[51:27] spirit that's in me that that it takes
[51:30] the spirit of the life of Jesus Christ
[51:32] to come into me Amen to as the Bible
[51:36] says I'm a new creation that's right now
[51:39] we just read there from Genesis and it
[51:41] said that God in the beginning God
[51:42] created the heavens and the
[51:45] Earth and then and then it spoke to how
[51:48] the Earth was void and how after that
[51:50] void then he speaks and he said God said
[51:55] let there be light and there was and not
[51:57] just there was but there still
[52:00] is and even the light that's on right
[52:03] now is not the same light these lights
[52:07] and even the sunlight outside it's not
[52:09] the same sunlight that was here
[52:11] yesterday right because the light is
[52:14] still continuing to move it's pouring
[52:16] out from
[52:18] God because it's transitive amen and
[52:21] just as the life came out of that water
[52:23] and goes into my body the life comes out
[52:26] from the Throne of God Amen and from the
[52:29] Throne of God it moves and the light
[52:32] begin continues to create I was reading
[52:35] something yesterday from an astronomy
[52:37] Channel and they talked about how
[52:39] they've discovered that there is a light
[52:42] and a sound
[52:43] that they don't know where it started
[52:45] they don't know where it came from but
[52:47] they said even as it's moving now
[52:49] through space and Through the
[52:52] Universe it's actually changing you know
[52:55] we know that light comes in waves like
[52:57] sound does and even the waves on the sea
[53:00] they come at different intervals and
[53:02] there's different sizes and so it is
[53:04] with light as it comes forth from God by
[53:08] the word of God it has life that it
[53:11] carries the inoc and they said even the
[53:13] spectrum of the light that was they have
[53:17] determined that the Spectrum the colors
[53:20] have
[53:21] changed from what was struck the Earth
[53:24] say a thousand years ago the Spectrum
[53:27] has actually changed and intensified I
[53:30] believe it was
[53:32] that it it's just it's changed to a
[53:35] different actual color even in the light
[53:38] that we
[53:39] see and that sounds kind of strange but
[53:43] you know here a few months ago they said
[53:45] well you got cataracts so they put some
[53:47] new little fers in there and uh I was so
[53:52] amazed about the second day after the
[53:55] they take the dark glasses and stuff I'm
[53:57] I'm looking around I'm just I'm walking
[53:59] up to people going wow wow I I haven't
[54:03] seen that blue for a long
[54:05] time wow look at the red on
[54:08] that because the Spectrum changed amen
[54:13] and when we put the lens of God's word
[54:16] and the lens of the experience asking
[54:20] Jesus Christ just come take me yeah
[54:24] that's how yeah
[54:26] I I look back and you know sometimes it
[54:28] seems like we kind of brag about what we
[54:30] did in the life before no man I was a
[54:33] rock and roll
[54:34] bum but when Jesus Christ got a hold of
[54:38] me the light the lens
[54:41] changed and now I looked back and I was
[54:45] talking to the brothers right before
[54:46] service
[54:47] and you know we did a lot a lot a lot a
[54:51] lot of services since we saw you last
[54:54] and
[54:55] brother Chris he said man but you look
[54:57] younger I said well yeah the spectrum's
[55:02] changed and the life of God Aaron put an
[55:07] old stick in the in before the Lord and
[55:10] the stick blood
[55:12] buted and you say well you know I sorry
[55:15] about your your mom God bless you but we
[55:18] know this that she might be budding
[55:21] right
[55:21] now we look at it as well that old stick
[55:25] that old B this old body but that spirit
[55:29] is budding into the presence of
[55:32] God and how that God can take these
[55:36] words and and if we realize this whole
[55:39] gospel that we believe in it's
[55:41] continually moving and continually
[55:44] changing and it's we realize that in
[55:47] Hebrews 13:8 it says that he's the same
[55:49] yesterday today and
[55:51] forever but we also read that it's in
[55:54] one place place that calls him and morha
[55:56] in the Greek which means to change the
[55:59] mask that's
[56:01] right the as we think of it we're in
[56:03] three part bodies we're in an outside
[56:06] body we're in a spirit that makes this
[56:08] outside body move and beyond that is the
[56:11] soul or the
[56:13] nature of the human being we were
[56:16] because of Genesis you know in the
[56:19] Garden of Eden took on a nature of the
[56:22] world and of the
[56:23] flesh but now
[56:25] through Jesus Christ we can take on the
[56:28] nature of God and as we take on the
[56:32] nature of God we step from one position
[56:36] to another position to where that God
[56:38] can come and begin to move the light
[56:41] through these mortal bodies and he can
[56:44] place his nature day by day Wave by wave
[56:48] into our
[56:49] lives and wave by wave you know we we
[56:53] sing about oh praise God I'm redeemed
[56:55] but it goes beyond Redemption that's
[56:58] right as we think of that's right in the
[57:00] the normal you know people well praise
[57:03] the Lord I believe in Jesus Christ I'm
[57:05] saved yeah but you're saved for a
[57:07] purpose you are saved so that you can
[57:10] exude the light of Jesus Christ so that
[57:14] Christ can come into us and show himself
[57:18] we talk about the righteousness of God
[57:21] he is the righteous one but his right
[57:24] righteousness continues to move and it
[57:27] continues to expand and it continues to
[57:31] go out in the into the universe and it
[57:33] moves from we would say the the heart
[57:36] the bottle of God into our hearts and
[57:39] into our lives that we might exude the
[57:43] righteousness and the Bible says that we
[57:45] become the righteousness of
[57:47] God the lord it's because his
[57:50] righteousness changed me from a sinner
[57:54] from whatever I was before into a man
[57:57] that can hopefully exude the presence of
[58:00] Jesus Christ that you and I can take the
[58:03] presence of Jesus Christ to someone
[58:07] else it's not just so you can sit in
[58:09] church it's not just so you can sit
[58:12] around a tape recorder or read those are
[58:15] all great things but the life of Jesus
[58:18] Christ should be moving that's it should
[58:21] be
[58:22] transitive we think of the the children
[58:24] of
[58:25] Israel and we know that there had been a
[58:30] prophecy how that when God had come to
[58:34] Abraham in the form of
[58:37] MDC no father no mother no and so on as
[58:41] you read about him in that form in the
[58:44] book of Hebrews but he came to Abraham
[58:48] and when he came to Abraham the life
[58:51] from that God moved into Abraham
[58:55] and then we know that there's so many
[58:58] types and shadows Jesus Christ is
[59:01] everywhere in this book amen and it
[59:05] would take months weeks years a
[59:08] lifetime to even touch a few chapters
[59:11] really sometimes but we know there was a
[59:14] promise given to Abraham now we think
[59:16] about this so here is God speaking to
[59:20] Abraham and he's just told him about
[59:22] Sodom and such and what's going to
[59:25] happen there and then he gives this
[59:28] promise to Abraham now think about this
[59:32] he says Abraham your seed's going to go
[59:34] down and dwell in a Strange Land for 400
[59:37] years and after that I'm going to come
[59:40] on the
[59:41] scene and take him out and the purpose
[59:45] for taking them out of Egypt he doesn't
[59:47] call it Egypt there but he says a
[59:49] Strange Land he said the purpose is for
[59:51] that because I want to put them in
[59:53] another land yeah so what just
[59:58] happened the word of God the light the
[1:00:02] power behind the word God said let there
[1:00:06] be light and there was light it's
[1:00:08] different light today because light's
[1:00:10] continuing to move transitive through
[1:00:12] the universe through our lives and how
[1:00:15] that that word went from Abraham into
[1:00:18] Abraham's seed which was Isaac as far as
[1:00:22] the natural man but what was ISAC
[1:00:24] carrier of well you read the life of
[1:00:28] Isaac and we find types and shadows of
[1:00:31] Jesus Christ in his life and even how
[1:00:34] that when it came time for him to be
[1:00:37] married Abraham said you know gave it to
[1:00:40] his servant said go find him a wife
[1:00:42] among my
[1:00:43] Kindred we are to be a wife of this
[1:00:47] Kindred the Kindred seed of Jesus Christ
[1:00:51] and how did it move from Isaac and how
[1:00:54] from Isaac you know into to uh Jacob and
[1:00:58] Esau and on down and how that and that
[1:01:01] it was continually moving moving moving
[1:01:04] and how that everything once God speaks
[1:01:06] something the entire universe begins to
[1:01:10] come into order and to move to move and
[1:01:15] transitively move everything into
[1:01:17] position to bring the word of God to
[1:01:19] pass because that word that went to
[1:01:22] Abraham goes to Isaac goes to Jacob and
[1:01:24] it's moving moving moving through
[1:01:26] history and this one we got that one and
[1:01:28] this one and this it's all the word of
[1:01:30] God transiting moving two time until one
[1:01:34] day wow there's a famine we got to go
[1:01:36] get some food we're
[1:01:38] hungry and so they go down to Egypt hey
[1:01:41] at first everything's Grand and happy
[1:01:44] sometimes you know you you meet Jesus
[1:01:45] Christ and we used to joke around a
[1:01:47] little bit but how that wow God kind of
[1:01:50] put a hedge around you and everything's
[1:01:52] great for a while and then all of a
[1:01:54] sudden he pulls out the
[1:01:56] carpet wow I didn't know it was going to
[1:01:58] be like this and life becomes a battle
[1:02:01] and a struggle but it's God moving and
[1:02:05] putting the character the character the
[1:02:08] life that's in the
[1:02:11] Bottle Into You and I through our
[1:02:15] struggles through the things that we go
[1:02:17] through in life and eventually Egypt got
[1:02:20] to where they're in bondage they're
[1:02:23] getting be they're getting whipped
[1:02:25] they're going through all these things
[1:02:28] and what was it it's the life of God
[1:02:31] putting the character of God into them
[1:02:35] because he when they get out what's he
[1:02:38] tell them he said well you know you just
[1:02:40] went through this so you'll
[1:02:42] learn what it's like to be in Str be a
[1:02:45] stranger and be in bondage so that
[1:02:48] you'll learn how to treat other people
[1:02:52] it's bottom
[1:02:53] line and how that you all do these
[1:02:56] things because the life of God is being
[1:02:59] transferred from the word that can't
[1:03:01] started as a seed Abraham and now we see
[1:03:05] the fruit of the fruition the fullness
[1:03:07] of it being manifested in the children
[1:03:10] of Israel the word of God had become
[1:03:14] transitive the moment he spoke it and it
[1:03:17] moved in waves through time there was
[1:03:19] times they were up times they were down
[1:03:21] times they were up times they were down
[1:03:25] that's right because it moves in waves
[1:03:28] but the Spectrum changed from that
[1:03:31] little tiny seed that went to Abraham
[1:03:34] thy seed shall go down until here's a
[1:03:37] mass and a multitude of a harvest from
[1:03:41] that first little tiny words the
[1:03:44] Abraham because it's expanding it's
[1:03:47] growing it's moving it's a moving word
[1:03:50] of God in us amen amen praise the Lord
[1:03:54] the Lord that's right well maybe I
[1:03:57] should look at my notes I don't
[1:03:59] know but let's look at something we know
[1:04:02] in Genesis 1:1 you don't have to turn to
[1:04:05] it it just says let let every seed bring
[1:04:07] forth of its own kind and God said let
[1:04:11] the Earth bring forth grass and Herb
[1:04:13] yielding seed and fruit tree yielding
[1:04:15] fruit after his kind whose seed is in
[1:04:17] itself upon the Earth and it was
[1:04:21] so that little space you know and it was
[1:04:26] so there was a word went forth every
[1:04:30] seed brings forth of its own
[1:04:32] kind and it was so am and that that
[1:04:36] little those two one of the greatest
[1:04:38] Mysteries to me in this whole end time
[1:04:40] message that we talk about is that
[1:04:42] there's a time space between those two
[1:04:44] little dots what a
[1:04:46] mystery there's people out there that
[1:04:48] struggle and and and strain and wonder
[1:04:51] why why they think the bi Bible's all
[1:04:53] mix up well if you understand that it's
[1:04:58] not
[1:04:59] just 15 minutes ago this bottle was
[1:05:03] full but now it's lost some of what it
[1:05:06] had to become something else because
[1:05:09] it's
[1:05:10] moving and it was so and so seed be
[1:05:15] continues to Bear of its own kind and
[1:05:17] Seed continues to bring forth what it
[1:05:20] was if I give brother Trevor here's
[1:05:22] Trevor go plant some corn
[1:05:24] and I flip him a bunch of corn I
[1:05:26] probably should say that to Paul he's
[1:05:28] the corn planter around
[1:05:30] here but if we give here's some new corn
[1:05:33] brother Paul go try it well if he plants
[1:05:37] it think figures he's going to get fig
[1:05:39] trees or palm trees sorry buddy it's not
[1:05:41] going to happen because the word
[1:05:44] declared it would be a certain way and
[1:05:48] we read there in the in the beginning
[1:05:51] was the word the word was with God and
[1:05:53] that that's a form of God that you're
[1:05:57] listening to this morning his word and
[1:06:00] that but the ability or the life that's
[1:06:03] in the water the life that's in the
[1:06:06] water the life that's in the water has
[1:06:10] now encompassed and is
[1:06:12] fulfilling what the life is all about
[1:06:16] and it's about Jesus
[1:06:18] Christ and so it is with every
[1:06:21] seed and how and that's why I wanted to
[1:06:24] read that that 12th verse because
[1:06:28] sometimes we struggle and and we strain
[1:06:31] and we get in the trials and you know
[1:06:33] even when God first came through Moses
[1:06:36] to the children of Israel they wanted to
[1:06:38] Stone the guy because oh he's got the
[1:06:43] power you know the shepherd guy comes
[1:06:45] down out of the Wilderness the prophet
[1:06:47] of God and declares Pharaoh let my
[1:06:50] people go and he's I'm letting your
[1:06:51] people go forget it what are you talking
[1:06:54] about fact we're going to take away the
[1:06:56] straw to make it harder to make bricks
[1:06:58] just because you're a smart alec he's
[1:07:00] he's talking to the you know the
[1:07:02] president of the the world so to speak
[1:07:04] at that time and he said well and so now
[1:07:08] the next day or however however long
[1:07:11] between those waves the people the
[1:07:13] children of us they wanted to kill him
[1:07:16] because what
[1:07:17] Moses you said we're going to go out of
[1:07:19] here and now life got
[1:07:22] harder we're making bricks without straw
[1:07:25] yeah and we have to go gather our own
[1:07:27] straw at night Egyptians aren't even
[1:07:29] going to give it to us
[1:07:30] anymore
[1:07:33] well it didn't look good did it but what
[1:07:37] happened it continued to move that's
[1:07:39] right and because of that there was this
[1:07:42] plague and that plague and wave after
[1:07:46] wave of the word of God starts through
[1:07:48] Egypt because it has to bring forth amen
[1:07:52] what that little sea was in the
[1:07:54] beginning to
[1:07:56] Abraham they're going to go down there
[1:07:58] but I'm going to bring them out and not
[1:08:01] only am I going to bring them out the
[1:08:03] purpose is I want to take them in
[1:08:04] somewhere
[1:08:06] else and God's word was bringing forth
[1:08:09] of its own kind transitively moving
[1:08:12] moving moving to create the image of
[1:08:17] which you saw and in verse 12 we read it
[1:08:20] there in
[1:08:21] John and for some reason it seems like
[1:08:24] when I hear preaching from the first
[1:08:26] chapter of John A lot of people kind of
[1:08:28] skipped this verse yeah but in 12 it
[1:08:31] says but as many has received
[1:08:34] him that's a person that's right it's
[1:08:37] not just going to church it's not just
[1:08:40] saying oh I believe a Bible no it's the
[1:08:43] person amen of the word of God who is
[1:08:46] Jesus
[1:08:51] Christ it's the person you must receive
[1:08:55] him the person of Jesus Christ and when
[1:08:58] you receive him the purp the person the
[1:09:01] life that's in the
[1:09:03] water of the word then what happens it
[1:09:07] says that he gave them power to become
[1:09:11] the sons of God even to them that
[1:09:14] believe on his name do you believe on
[1:09:15] his name today if you believe on the
[1:09:18] name of Jesus Christ the word is already
[1:09:21] transitively moved into your heart heart
[1:09:24] to make you Sons and Daughters of
[1:09:28] God have you received him if you have
[1:09:31] received him them gave he power you have
[1:09:34] power to overcome the trials of this
[1:09:37] life you have power to overcome the whip
[1:09:40] of the Egyptian out here this world that
[1:09:42] we live in we have the power imparted to
[1:09:46] us by The Living Water of the Gospel of
[1:09:49] Jesus Christ because it's moving and the
[1:09:53] people people that I look at today
[1:09:55] you're not the same people that were
[1:09:57] here last time I spoke here a few months
[1:09:59] ago because your lives are different
[1:10:02] you're just a little bit higher with God
[1:10:05] because that power that's in the water
[1:10:08] has moved off of these Pages through the
[1:10:11] preaching of the word through the
[1:10:12] brothers through what you've learned
[1:10:14] through prayer and what you've learned
[1:10:15] through Christ you're higher you taking
[1:10:18] us higher and higher and higher as it
[1:10:21] says in the book of uh Isaiah
[1:10:24] I think it's chapter 28 it says it'll be
[1:10:26] line upon line line upon line here a
[1:10:29] little there a little precept upon
[1:10:31] precept and as we receive those precepts
[1:10:35] as we receive that line upon
[1:10:38] line even without realizing it sometimes
[1:10:42] you're growing you're growing into the
[1:10:45] stature of Jesus Christ transitively
[1:10:48] moving from the pages of the book
[1:10:51] through the speaking of the word through
[1:10:52] your prayer life from whatever it is
[1:10:55] every time it's God moving it's all
[1:10:57] Jesus
[1:11:00] Christ it's all Jesus Christ moving his
[1:11:04] life out of the bottle of these pages
[1:11:08] into our hearts into our lives so that
[1:11:12] he can prove that you have become his
[1:11:18] righteousness and with that I want to
[1:11:21] say it's in Isaiah 56 but he said that
[1:11:25] not only has his Mercy has his
[1:11:28] righteousness moved it was his righteous
[1:11:31] judgment his choice that made us it was
[1:11:34] our choice to receive it it was his
[1:11:37] choice to offer it and then somebody
[1:11:42] packaged this bottle and they put water
[1:11:44] in it it was their choice to package it
[1:11:48] amen it's my
[1:11:50] choice my tongue's dry to receive it
[1:11:58] I hope you're thirsty but there's not
[1:12:00] enough left in here for today
[1:12:03] sorry but it's the life of God moving
[1:12:08] moving from his word by his Spirit into
[1:12:11] your hearts and your lives so not
[1:12:14] only are we becoming his righteousness
[1:12:18] cuz it was his choice to offer himself
[1:12:20] to us it was his choice Amen to offer
[1:12:24] and it's our choice to accept the offer
[1:12:26] and say Lord here am I
[1:12:30] Hallelujah and because it was a
[1:12:33] righteous
[1:12:34] choice we become part of his
[1:12:37] righteousness hallu but there's
[1:12:39] something else that goes with it as it
[1:12:42] was his Mercy imparted to us we become
[1:12:46] the
[1:12:47] mercy of God to a dying
[1:12:50] world that's why a lot of lot of people
[1:12:53] think it's all in church no you know the
[1:12:57] the little lady there in I think she
[1:13:00] said she's from
[1:13:02] FY Al
[1:13:05] Alabama
[1:13:06] and we just got to talking about the
[1:13:09] gospel and W up praying with her what is
[1:13:12] that it's the mercy of God because he's
[1:13:15] still
[1:13:16] looking the mercy of God dwells in you
[1:13:21] and just as the righteousness of God has
[1:13:23] been imparted to us we are made
[1:13:26] righteous by the blood of Jesus Christ
[1:13:29] so is the mercy of God that comes with
[1:13:33] his righteousness through his choice
[1:13:36] through his desire to through Jesus
[1:13:39] God's desire through Jesus Christ to
[1:13:41] offer us the life of Jesus Christ if you
[1:13:45] can believe as it said in that 12th
[1:13:48] verse receiving
[1:13:51] him gives you the power that's because
[1:13:54] it's moving transitive out from as it
[1:13:57] were the Throne of God into Jesus Christ
[1:14:01] and from Jesus Christ through not you
[1:14:04] know a lot of times we say well I
[1:14:06] believe the death burial and
[1:14:07] Resurrection but there's another part
[1:14:10] because it moved again Not only was
[1:14:12] there a resurrection there was an
[1:14:14] outpouring of what we call the Holy
[1:14:16] Ghost that's it and as and it was the
[1:14:19] life of God because you can find it in
[1:14:21] the word in the word you can find it in
[1:14:22] Acts 2 you can find it in Joel too you
[1:14:24] can find it other places in the
[1:14:27] scripture where the life of God was
[1:14:30] moving it moved from God as it were into
[1:14:34] Jesus Christ and he became the fullness
[1:14:36] of the word he he paid for the whole law
[1:14:39] he paid for all those things because it
[1:14:41] was God moving God
[1:14:45] moving and how that after he paid all
[1:14:48] that went through death and becomes the
[1:14:52] righteousness of God to be be imparted
[1:14:53] to us through death burial and
[1:14:55] resurrection and pouring himself back
[1:14:59] into US repent everyone he be baptized
[1:15:01] in the name of Jesus Christ and you
[1:15:05] shall
[1:15:06] receive it's
[1:15:08] moving moving through the body through
[1:15:12] the heavenlies through the outpouring of
[1:15:14] the Holy Ghost into our hearts that's
[1:15:17] right that we might show that we are the
[1:15:20] righteousness and the mercy of God every
[1:15:22] time we took you know I don't know what
[1:15:24] you did with the prayer requests this
[1:15:25] morning but every time we take those
[1:15:27] prayer requests what is that you are
[1:15:30] becoming
[1:15:32] intercessors you are showing the mercy
[1:15:34] of God by the love of God to take your
[1:15:37] time and your efforts and your words to
[1:15:41] say Lord remember this person remember
[1:15:44] this family remember remember you can
[1:15:47] still heal blinded
[1:15:51] eyes we talk about you know you don't
[1:15:54] see it so much anymore in the US as you
[1:15:57] do we go to these foreign countries and
[1:16:00] we see so many miraculous things that
[1:16:02] God does over and over and
[1:16:06] over because they're
[1:16:08] hungry and when you preach the word of
[1:16:10] God it says faith comes by hearing
[1:16:12] hearing by the word and as you hear the
[1:16:14] word you apply if we apply that and just
[1:16:18] pray Lord let that word become life in
[1:16:23] in me yeah let this water any no matter
[1:16:27] how small it is when he when he spoke
[1:16:30] that promise to Abraham look at it it's
[1:16:32] only you know two lines on the page but
[1:16:36] look what it became yeah it became a
[1:16:38] mighty nation that destroyed the
[1:16:41] greatest nation on on the earth at that
[1:16:44] time which was Egypt two little
[1:16:48] lines and it destroyed the whole thing
[1:16:51] and it delivered them not only out of
[1:16:53] Egypt delivered him through the
[1:16:54] Wilderness and into the promised land
[1:16:58] those that could receive it that's it so
[1:17:01] we see the life and the nature of God
[1:17:07] manifested praise the
[1:17:10] Lord are you hungry this
[1:17:13] morning well praise the lord well look
[1:17:16] at a couple of
[1:17:18] things quickly I don't here just to take
[1:17:21] up your time
[1:17:24] but we don't get here that
[1:17:26] often and I just long to see you
[1:17:29] stronger and stronger and stronger in
[1:17:32] the Gospel of Jesus Christ Genesis 49 if
[1:17:35] you want to turn to it you don't have to
[1:17:36] get up but let's just look at
[1:17:38] it because now it's moved from Abraham
[1:17:42] to Isaac and from Isaac to Jacob but
[1:17:45] it's the word of God moving and as it
[1:17:48] moves down through and it comes into
[1:17:50] Jacob and he's a he's a prophet
[1:17:53] as it were so he's a carrier of the word
[1:17:56] of life and as he's carrying it he knows
[1:17:59] it his time his stick's
[1:18:02] dry it's getting pretty dry and he knows
[1:18:04] you know I'm just about ready to give it
[1:18:06] up here but he calls all of his sons
[1:18:09] together and he begins he begins to pray
[1:18:12] a blessing on each son and the 12 sons
[1:18:15] that he
[1:18:16] have and he tells them there in verse 2
[1:18:20] 49 and verse two he says gather
[1:18:21] yourselves together here ye sons of
[1:18:24] Jacob har hearken unto Israel your
[1:18:26] father and then he begins to pour
[1:18:29] blessings out as it were and how that
[1:18:33] there is a nature in each
[1:18:36] blessing and how that that nature winds
[1:18:40] up pouring itself into
[1:18:44] those those those sons of his and he
[1:18:48] talks of Reuben first and then he speaks
[1:18:50] of Simeon and Levi in verse 5
[1:18:53] and how that he says in verse 5
[1:18:56] instruments of Cruelty are in their
[1:18:58] habitations and he talks about that in
[1:19:00] verse six it says how in their anger
[1:19:02] they slew a man well you go back and
[1:19:06] read about it they slew a bunch of men
[1:19:08] actually because it was when their
[1:19:10] sister Dina had been defiled and they
[1:19:13] they wiped out a whole town of
[1:19:15] people because that was what was in
[1:19:17] their heart as they were to
[1:19:20] do and we look at that and that light
[1:19:23] life that was in them when this prophecy
[1:19:26] is coming forth about Simeon and
[1:19:29] Levi it's not just there that this shows
[1:19:33] up because when you travel ahead as it
[1:19:37] this word begins to move through time
[1:19:40] and it moves through 400 plus years of
[1:19:44] time and it lands on another son of
[1:19:47] Levi because when it talks about Moses
[1:19:50] it said he's from he's a from the tribe
[1:19:53] of
[1:19:54] Levi from a levite father and a levite
[1:19:57] mother and God takes that Spirit or that
[1:20:02] nature of as it were slay slaying a man
[1:20:06] and he go when he goes to Egypt he slays
[1:20:08] the whole the firstborn of the whole
[1:20:11] country because that was the life that
[1:20:14] was in him by way of the prophecy
[1:20:17] manifesting 400 years
[1:20:19] later and it doesn't stop there it
[1:20:23] continues to move on through time until
[1:20:26] eventually it comes to the days of Jesus
[1:20:29] Christ and what happens it was the
[1:20:32] Levites or the priesthood that slew
[1:20:36] Jesus Christ that's right because the
[1:20:38] nature of the prophecy was planted right
[1:20:41] there in seed form right there you slew
[1:20:46] a man and you dig down a wall and it was
[1:20:49] that spirit in Levi but don't
[1:20:53] don't think there's it's a problem for
[1:20:55] God because in Zachariah it says I will
[1:20:58] purify the sons of
[1:21:01] Levi another seed that okay you served
[1:21:06] that purpose and now I have another
[1:21:08] purpose for you
[1:21:10] Levi because another wave comes in
[1:21:14] another transitive feature from the
[1:21:16] nature of God and now from the what we
[1:21:20] would say the Levites always tease about
[1:21:22] my levitical garments when we come to
[1:21:24] the pulpit but from this
[1:21:28] nature what happens life is now being
[1:21:32] imparted as it were from the
[1:21:35] seed to the people amen and we could run
[1:21:40] that ahead for those who know
[1:21:43] this of the message that was called
[1:21:47] uh the indictment where are they the
[1:21:50] most religious people the most religious
[1:21:53] Nation rejected or killed put to shame
[1:21:57] amen this word through denominational
[1:22:01] Creed in
[1:22:03] Dogma praise the Lord so let's just go
[1:22:06] look at one more and how that in the
[1:22:09] next one there in verse eight it talks
[1:22:11] about
[1:22:12] Judah Judah Thou Art he who thine
[1:22:14] Brethren shall praise thy hand shall be
[1:22:16] in the neck of thine enemies thy
[1:22:17] father's children shall bow down before
[1:22:19] thee well he's talking about Judah
[1:22:22] correct
[1:22:23] Judah you're the one and your brothers
[1:22:26] brothers are going to praise you your
[1:22:28] hand will be in the neck of thy enemies
[1:22:30] thy father's children will bow down
[1:22:31] before thee who is it really talking
[1:22:34] about who is called The Lion of the
[1:22:37] tribe of Judah Jesus Christ so when we
[1:22:40] look at this what are we looking
[1:22:42] at well we know that David was from the
[1:22:46] line of Judah and his brother Brethren
[1:22:49] praised him after he slew Goliath which
[1:22:53] looking at the next line thy hand shall
[1:22:54] be in the neck of thy enemies you look
[1:22:56] that up in the Hebrews it means to cut
[1:22:57] the head off the enemy David had no
[1:23:00] sword he killed him with a stone what's
[1:23:02] the first thing he did he jumps up on
[1:23:04] top of him and takes his own sword and
[1:23:07] cut the head off of Goliath so it's the
[1:23:11] word of God moving in waves through
[1:23:13] history until his Brethren are going to
[1:23:16] praise him he cuts the neck off or the
[1:23:18] head off the enemy and their children
[1:23:21] will bow down before the you follow that
[1:23:23] through I want to say to uh into
[1:23:26] Chronicles and again it's moving moving
[1:23:29] moving and as it moves in the Chronicles
[1:23:31] when David they come to him and they say
[1:23:34] we we want to make you King David over
[1:23:37] all of it not just Judah but over all of
[1:23:39] Israel and they come and they bow down
[1:23:42] before
[1:23:43] him because that's part of the seed
[1:23:46] that's the growth process of the seed
[1:23:48] but what's the fullness of the seed was
[1:23:51] Jesus Christ
[1:23:53] Christ because we praise him I heard you
[1:23:56] sing a song We Praise You Lord Jesus and
[1:24:00] he cuts the head off your enemy of the
[1:24:03] world your enemies of this life and
[1:24:05] gives you the power the Resurrection The
[1:24:08] Power the righteousness of God the
[1:24:10] mercies of God so that you can cut the
[1:24:13] head off the Enemy by using the word of
[1:24:16] God Amen and at the end what happens
[1:24:20] every knee shall bow
[1:24:23] and every tongue confess amen that Jesus
[1:24:26] Christ is Lord that's right so you see
[1:24:28] the life moving transitively wave after
[1:24:32] wave through
[1:24:36] history well I don't know how long it's
[1:24:39] been let's look
[1:24:42] at Leviticus 24 for just a moment let's
[1:24:46] praying last night and this morning
[1:24:49] saying
[1:24:50] Lord spoken and so many different
[1:24:53] services and brother brandom said he
[1:24:55] used to look at his
[1:24:57] notes before he'd get up to speak and I
[1:25:01] was looking how many notes I got oh
[1:25:03] man I didn't know where to
[1:25:06] start but in Leviticus 24 and I never
[1:25:09] seen this this morning till I listening
[1:25:11] and reading to the
[1:25:13] word and the Lord spake unto Moses
[1:25:16] saying so what just
[1:25:19] happened the Lord spoke to
[1:25:22] Moses the Lord that's
[1:25:25] Elohim the self-existent one gives
[1:25:29] speech or speaks words to Moses because
[1:25:32] it says he was saying something to Moses
[1:25:35] so it's the same as the word of the Lord
[1:25:38] came to Moses amen and he's speaking to
[1:25:42] Moses then he says in verse two command
[1:25:45] the children of Israel that they bring
[1:25:47] unto thee pure olive oil beaten for the
[1:25:49] light to cause the lamps to burn
[1:25:55] continually Jesus Christ is in every
[1:25:59] verse somehow I wish I could brother
[1:26:02] deard I wish I could do a lot
[1:26:04] better but it's all Jesus Christ so
[1:26:07] what's he saying these word this word of
[1:26:09] the Lord that comes to Israel I like
[1:26:11] this part because I don't have you know
[1:26:12] I can point to things and how that this
[1:26:15] word of the Lord comes to Israel and he
[1:26:17] says bring unto thee pure olive oil
[1:26:20] beaten for the light right to cause the
[1:26:22] lamps to burn continually so what is
[1:26:27] happening in this verse that points us
[1:26:29] to Jesus Christ they have to bring pure
[1:26:34] olive oil and that olive oil has to be
[1:26:38] beaten and it has a purpose it's to
[1:26:40] bring forth light so that the lamps can
[1:26:44] burn
[1:26:45] continually so what are the missing
[1:26:47] pieces or what we would call the seventh
[1:26:49] seal what is it
[1:26:53] the they're going to bring this this
[1:26:55] pure olive oil that's been beaten I
[1:26:57] don't know if I remember maybe you get
[1:27:00] didn't get a see it or maybe you did in
[1:27:02] Israel where they take the Olive and
[1:27:04] they put them on a big rock kind of a
[1:27:08] table and then they have a giant stone
[1:27:10] with a stick through it and they they
[1:27:12] push it and they roll it and it crushes
[1:27:16] the olives it crushes those olives and
[1:27:20] from and that's why when you go to the
[1:27:21] market make sure you get the one that
[1:27:23] says pure virgin olive oil because
[1:27:25] that's the first press and after they've
[1:27:28] gone around once and they take that
[1:27:30] first pure oil from the olive then they
[1:27:33] go around and around and around until
[1:27:36] there's no more oil in the
[1:27:38] olives but he said there got to be pure
[1:27:40] olive oil it's the one that's beaten
[1:27:43] that's
[1:27:44] crushed Y and the reason it's crushed is
[1:27:48] to bring forth light that's right unto
[1:27:51] the lamps no you not you're the lamps of
[1:27:54] of the Gospel
[1:27:56] right right and so this is pointing us
[1:27:59] to Jesus Christ in our day that's right
[1:28:02] the Jesus Christ that was
[1:28:05] beaten and crushed as the olive he was
[1:28:09] crushed to bring forth the oil to put in
[1:28:13] your
[1:28:14] lamps so that we can burn
[1:28:17] continually in the presence of God so
[1:28:21] that you Jesus said are the light of the
[1:28:24] world it's pointing to Jesus Christ
[1:28:27] amen and how what I I don't see how what
[1:28:30] how you can make it any way
[1:28:32] other but then it continues in verse
[1:28:35] three he said without the veil of the
[1:28:38] testimony in the Tabernacle of the
[1:28:39] congregation shall a Aaron order it from
[1:28:42] the evening until the morning before the
[1:28:44] Lord continually it shall be a statute
[1:28:47] forever in your generation so what's
[1:28:49] happening here this
[1:28:52] light for the it's for a
[1:28:56] testimony in the
[1:28:58] Tabernacle of the
[1:29:00] congregation know you not you're the
[1:29:02] Tabernacles of the Holy Ghost so this
[1:29:05] light is to go into
[1:29:08] us and Aaron which is a levite is going
[1:29:13] to order it from the evening until the
[1:29:15] morning before the Lord continually what
[1:29:17] are we talking about we just came from
[1:29:20] an evening time message in evening time
[1:29:23] light and then after the seals have been
[1:29:27] opened what do we hear it is the rising
[1:29:30] of the sun right so from the evening
[1:29:33] until the morning this is talking about
[1:29:35] you and I right
[1:29:38] now you go before the Lord
[1:29:41] continually and that's a
[1:29:44] statute or like a
[1:29:46] written
[1:29:48] thing out of the rock into us for all
[1:29:51] all generations amen praise the Lord so
[1:29:56] we'll close Lord
[1:29:59] willing thinking about those CR that
[1:30:01] crushed
[1:30:02] Olive and we're told that job is
[1:30:05] actually the oldest book in the Bible
[1:30:08] and that from Genesis Leviticus Numbers
[1:30:11] Deuteronomy those were all written by
[1:30:13] Moses kind of after the
[1:30:16] fact but in job from the oldest book of
[1:30:20] the Bible in chapter 19
[1:30:22] and I think we probably covered this
[1:30:24] before but as I said it comes in
[1:30:27] waves and the Lord just was opening up
[1:30:30] something to us here recently think
[1:30:32] maybe when I was in El
[1:30:35] Salvador in job
[1:30:38] 19 we'll start at verse 23 Brothers
[1:30:41] thank
[1:30:42] you now we know that job has been going
[1:30:45] through oh man you think you got a try
[1:30:48] out let's try uh boil some the top of
[1:30:52] your head to the bottoms of your feet
[1:30:54] you can't
[1:30:56] walk you can't sit
[1:30:59] down because he's got boils everywhere
[1:31:03] so he's going through some trials right
[1:31:07] and we know that from Job chapter 1 it
[1:31:09] talks about when you know Satan went
[1:31:12] before the Lord and the Lord said if you
[1:31:13] considered my servant job and he speaks
[1:31:17] things about
[1:31:18] job he said well just keep your finger
[1:31:21] in kn 18 but look at verse chapter 1 it
[1:31:24] said
[1:31:28] uh in verse 6 job 1:6 now there was a
[1:31:32] day when the sons of God came to prevent
[1:31:35] present themselves before the Lord and
[1:31:37] Satan came also among them and Satan
[1:31:40] said you know the Lord says to Satan
[1:31:42] where did you come
[1:31:43] from Satan answers from walking to and
[1:31:46] fr the Earth and walking up and down and
[1:31:48] it Lord says have you considered in
[1:31:50] verse 8 my servant job and then the word
[1:31:54] of God begins to speak about
[1:31:59] job I love this because the life that's
[1:32:03] in the seed comes by way of the word
[1:32:06] Jesus said Jesus in I forgot John Which
[1:32:09] chapter I think it's eight he said my
[1:32:11] word is a seed and just as this water
[1:32:15] was put in the bottle there's life in
[1:32:17] the water so there's life in the seed
[1:32:20] and the seed that's in the that God is
[1:32:22] putting into job there's nobody like
[1:32:25] him he's
[1:32:28] perfect he's
[1:32:31] upright he's one that fears God and
[1:32:33] hates
[1:32:35] evil what has God just done to job he's
[1:32:39] put the life of the word of God into
[1:32:44] job and Satan he doesn't think like we
[1:32:47] do he's saying well you let me touch his
[1:32:50] you know t touch him and he'll curse you
[1:32:52] to his face he doesn't realize the power
[1:32:57] of of creation lies in every word God
[1:33:02] says put your for put your hand now and
[1:33:04] touch all that he hath and he'll curse
[1:33:06] it your face and God said to Satan
[1:33:08] behold everything he's got's in your
[1:33:11] power and Satan said the reason he
[1:33:13] serves you is because you have a hedge
[1:33:14] around him we skip that verse but where
[1:33:17] did he get the
[1:33:18] Hedge said he had all those cattle he
[1:33:21] had all that stuff and he performed the
[1:33:24] sacrifice not just for himself but for
[1:33:28] his
[1:33:29] family well so what's the first thing
[1:33:33] Satan does he takes all his cattle takes
[1:33:36] all his beasts knocks down his you takes
[1:33:39] his family takes their houses takes
[1:33:41] everything that job has and going into
[1:33:45] you know that next
[1:33:48] part uh you know they came and they it
[1:33:51] says the there in verse 20 still in ver
[1:33:53] in chapter 1 then job Rose and ran his
[1:33:55] mantle and shaved his head and fell down
[1:33:56] to the ground and worshiped said naked I
[1:33:58] came out of my mother's womb naked I
[1:34:00] shall return thither and the lord gave
[1:34:02] what the lord gave he hath taken away
[1:34:05] blessed be the name of the Lord and in
[1:34:08] all this job sinned not nor charged God
[1:34:13] foolishly did you ever think about
[1:34:16] why because he's perfect amen that Seed
[1:34:21] Life of God has moved or is moving wave
[1:34:26] after
[1:34:27] wave into the life of Job and first he
[1:34:31] loses the cattle then he loses his
[1:34:32] family he loses all these things but it
[1:34:35] said he didn't do
[1:34:37] foolishly because the life of God had
[1:34:41] moved from the word into the life of
[1:34:45] job but we know the trial
[1:34:48] continues oh he's got all kinds of
[1:34:50] struggles Lord be merciful to
[1:34:54] me I I've thought I had a few trials
[1:34:57] before and how that you come down
[1:35:01] eventually and it gets to a place to
[1:35:03] where there in verse n chapter back in
[1:35:05] chapter 19 you pull your finger out and
[1:35:08] how
[1:35:10] that he gets to the place and we know
[1:35:12] even as early I mean it it's all through
[1:35:15] the life of Job we find different types
[1:35:17] and shadows of Jesus Christ different
[1:35:20] types and shadows of our own age and I
[1:35:23] love this little set of scriptures
[1:35:25] because it's not only about the Jesus
[1:35:28] Christ of Calvary but it's about the
[1:35:30] Jesus Christ of right now yes sir and
[1:35:34] that's the one I live for that's the one
[1:35:36] I want to drink
[1:35:42] from Lord Give Me Your Life let the life
[1:35:47] of this book live in me Amen to live
[1:35:51] live in you so that we can present
[1:35:54] ourselves to Jesus Christ a body without
[1:35:57] spot or
[1:35:59] wrinkle but he comes to the
[1:36:02] place wow if we go to verse 20 you got
[1:36:04] to go to Psalms 22 so we'll start with
[1:36:09] 23 or 22 he says why do you persecute me
[1:36:12] as God aren't you satisfied with this
[1:36:14] flesh think about it job's you know he's
[1:36:18] been scraping himself with the broken
[1:36:20] vessel what
[1:36:22] so he's you know what's he doing with
[1:36:24] that broken vessel if you you know you'd
[1:36:27] have to go back some chapters and he's
[1:36:28] scraping the poison out with the broken
[1:36:32] vessel what is that who's the broken
[1:36:34] vessel
[1:36:36] Christ he was broken for us at Calvary
[1:36:40] so he's taking the the Christ of the
[1:36:43] Bible to get rid of the
[1:36:45] poison that's in his body why did he go
[1:36:48] to the ash
[1:36:49] sheep yeah why didn't he go find a nice
[1:36:52] cold stream this is what I probably
[1:36:54] would have done I'm looking for the
[1:36:55] coldest water I can get into but not job
[1:36:58] he went to the asep because the
[1:37:01] ashes were the only thing he had
[1:37:05] left that he could look at and say I
[1:37:09] performed the the word of
[1:37:12] God I know I have performed the
[1:37:15] sacrifice because at the end of the
[1:37:17] sacrifice they burnt the offering and
[1:37:19] they would take the ashes out the camp
[1:37:23] and dump him and job when he was in that
[1:37:26] condition he went and laid himself on
[1:37:29] the ash
[1:37:31] Heap because he said I know I've done
[1:37:34] the right the right thing oh if you've
[1:37:37] never met Jesus Christ ask him into your
[1:37:39] heart Hallelujah lay yourself in the ash
[1:37:43] Heap as it were of Jesus Christ perform
[1:37:46] the sacrifice in your life in my life
[1:37:50] that that word of of God can become
[1:37:52] transitive and move and move through
[1:37:55] each of us so he says why do you P you
[1:37:57] aren't you satisfied with what I look
[1:37:59] like you know I'm all scraped up I got
[1:38:02] black stuff all over me they didn't even
[1:38:05] recognize him when they first went to
[1:38:07] see him it said they stood a far off
[1:38:08] going wow is that job can you imagine
[1:38:11] what he smelled like you ever smelled
[1:38:13] one boil they
[1:38:15] think and he's covered with the
[1:38:18] things and so he continues
[1:38:22] he said oh that my words were written in
[1:38:25] a book oh that they were printed in a
[1:38:27] book job's a
[1:38:30] prophet and he says oh that my words
[1:38:33] were now written oh that they were
[1:38:35] printed in the book did you realize in
[1:38:37] the days of job they didn't use
[1:38:39] books they used the
[1:38:42] Scrolls and they would take the Scrolls
[1:38:44] and as we get into the next
[1:38:46] verse they would take an iron pin
[1:38:51] and they would take the Scrolls and in a
[1:38:54] skin left over from the sacrifice you go
[1:38:56] back to Leviticus 7 it says the priest
[1:38:58] gets to keep the skin the priest that
[1:39:00] makes the sacrifice and job knew he made
[1:39:03] the sacrifice and he's laying on the
[1:39:05] proof that he made the sacrifice but
[1:39:07] they would take in that little
[1:39:09] chisel and they would chisel the word of
[1:39:12] God into the
[1:39:15] Skins I hope you're feeling chiseled
[1:39:18] this
[1:39:19] morning by the word of God
[1:39:22] God and they would chisel it into the
[1:39:24] skins and that's why the priest got to
[1:39:26] keep the skin of the sacrifice because
[1:39:28] he would use that skin to go back and
[1:39:31] look at the words of
[1:39:34] God and he said that uh written and all
[1:39:38] that they were printed in a book what is
[1:39:40] this we just read his words from a book
[1:39:43] this day that prophecy is fulfilled
[1:39:46] before your eyes he's a prophet and he's
[1:39:49] prophesying oh that my words were
[1:39:51] written they are yes sir amen and
[1:39:55] they're printed in a book amen so that
[1:39:58] we can read them and we become the
[1:40:01] beneficiaries of the prophecy of God
[1:40:04] that was there in two little lines and
[1:40:07] now it's being imparted unto each and
[1:40:10] every one of us more than just in the
[1:40:12] book amen but the words in the book
[1:40:16] placed before us by our eyes in the
[1:40:19] flesh through modern technology how be
[1:40:23] it it's still God moving in
[1:40:26] waves just about done if you hang on a
[1:40:29] few more
[1:40:30] minutes he said and that they were
[1:40:32] Graven with an iron pen and led in the
[1:40:35] rock
[1:40:37] forever well we
[1:40:39] know these pages are actually you know
[1:40:42] printed with lead by the way I suppose
[1:40:45] now they got different ways of doing the
[1:40:47] ink but when they first started printing
[1:40:49] them in book they had the old things in
[1:40:50] it would literally
[1:40:53] print
[1:40:54] lead into
[1:40:57] the into the
[1:40:59] parchments so he's saying
[1:41:02] oh that his words were Graven with an
[1:41:05] iron pin and led in the rock forever
[1:41:09] who's the rock of our
[1:41:11] Salvation it's Jesus Christ we know that
[1:41:14] you can read it many places in the
[1:41:18] Bible he said oh that they were Graven
[1:41:21] and then you're back to that little pen
[1:41:23] Graven with an iron pen and let me read
[1:41:27] the
[1:41:28] uh I wanted to get this definition right
[1:41:31] for
[1:41:32] you
[1:41:37] uh I guess I owe this to my fourth grade
[1:41:40] teacher because when you got in trouble
[1:41:42] you didn't get to go out the recess you
[1:41:44] had to sit in there and write out pages
[1:41:47] and pages of dictionary work I learned
[1:41:50] to appreciate words from the fourth
[1:41:52] grade on and what the definitions mean
[1:41:56] when he says iron pen
[1:41:59] there it's I know the Hebrews would
[1:42:02] laugh at me but it's beer
[1:42:04] ofi yeah for what it's word
[1:42:07] that's and it says it's an iron
[1:42:11] Implement and it has mult kind of
[1:42:14] multiple meanings when you think about
[1:42:15] Hebrew each letter has represents a
[1:42:18] number in Hebrew and each number has
[1:42:20] kind of its own
[1:42:22] little uh interpretation or its own
[1:42:26] little
[1:42:27] definition and so even he says an iron
[1:42:29] pen and it's used uh well we know that
[1:42:34] it represents Rome because in the Statue
[1:42:36] of Daniel when it came down it was you
[1:42:39] know the iron legs and then iron and
[1:42:40] clay at the end time and how that that
[1:42:43] was
[1:42:44] manifested in our day if you want to
[1:42:46] call it that now it's back in the 50s
[1:42:48] and I remember seeing it when I was a
[1:42:50] little kid
[1:42:51] a man named kusf who means
[1:42:54] clay beat his foot representing that
[1:42:58] beast in Daniel on the head of the
[1:43:00] Nations the United Nations and said
[1:43:02] we'll bury you speaking to the president
[1:43:04] of a country whose name Eisenhower means
[1:43:08] iron there's your your
[1:43:12] toes because from the
[1:43:14] foot you see how God's moving and from
[1:43:17] there we see all these troubles and
[1:43:19] problems and things going on because
[1:43:22] that beast in the days of Daniel had to
[1:43:25] be smitten in the feet with a rock UNH
[1:43:28] by hand who's the rock Jesus
[1:43:32] Christ being revealed to us in his word
[1:43:35] amen love
[1:43:37] him and how that it also means when it
[1:43:41] says an iron pan it means like we said a
[1:43:43] stylus a a an iron stylus usually with a
[1:43:48] d diamond tip so that they can ride in
[1:43:51] stone in
[1:43:52] metal or used as a marking
[1:43:56] stick or chiseled as it were into the we
[1:44:00] think the parchment or the the skins and
[1:44:03] so it's an iron
[1:44:05] pen and how that iron but it has a
[1:44:09] secondary meaning and
[1:44:12] this when the Lord by his grace shows us
[1:44:17] things my it says it's an iron
[1:44:23] Implement that's
[1:44:25] used for the lean olive
[1:44:29] tree and it's used to pierce holes in
[1:44:33] that Olive before it's
[1:44:36] crushed it's just a little like you've
[1:44:39] seen the ones they do with cherries
[1:44:41] right to knock the seeds out of the
[1:44:44] Cherry this particular one is in
[1:44:46] reference to the one they used on the
[1:44:48] olives before
[1:44:51] just before they crush the olive they
[1:44:54] remove the
[1:44:56] seed and the olive Falls onto the
[1:44:59] platform and they been begin to crush
[1:45:02] the
[1:45:03] olive it's Jesus
[1:45:06] Christ what happened Jesus said My Flesh
[1:45:09] profits nothing
[1:45:11] yeah my word is a seed amen what's in
[1:45:15] the seed the life that's right and the
[1:45:18] life was removed d by an iron
[1:45:23] pen from Jesus Christ because the word
[1:45:27] said he was wounded for our
[1:45:29] transgression with his stripes we were
[1:45:32] healed and all those other Promises of
[1:45:34] God that are now being manifest in us
[1:45:38] the seed from the iron pin the life was
[1:45:42] removed so that the olive can
[1:45:46] continue hence you're here this morning
[1:45:49] friends we're Graven with an iron pen
[1:45:53] and it had to be the lean Olive that's
[1:45:55] the first fruits of the Olive Tree
[1:45:58] because it hasn't had time to fatten up
[1:46:00] yet and it's the most healthy and that's
[1:46:03] where you get the remember Leviticus
[1:46:05] said it had to be pure olive
[1:46:08] oil because the pure oil comes from the
[1:46:10] lean seed and that's where you get what
[1:46:13] we call Virgin Olive Oil amen they
[1:46:17] remove the Life by way of this seed and
[1:46:21] then they crush the olive to bring forth
[1:46:24] the pure
[1:46:25] oil so
[1:46:27] that back there with those
[1:46:31] people the light has to be stricken with
[1:46:35] fire the oil had to be stricken with
[1:46:38] fire to bring forth the
[1:46:40] light and as you receive that Holy Ghost
[1:46:43] it comes with fire as it did in the book
[1:46:47] of
[1:46:49] Acts it's all Jesus Christ every word of
[1:46:53] this some I wish I could tell you more
[1:46:54] more more drink
[1:46:58] friends because he the life was knocked
[1:47:01] out by an iron
[1:47:04] pen in those feet in those hands the
[1:47:07] life was taken out so that he could be
[1:47:10] crushed and the Bible said he even went
[1:47:12] that life that was knocked out went to
[1:47:15] fulfill one last thing from the word of
[1:47:17] God it said he went and preached to the
[1:47:19] souls in heaven
[1:47:21] that's right for you and I in the book
[1:47:22] of
[1:47:24] Peter to show them this is the gospel
[1:47:28] you
[1:47:29] rejected that Noah told you about that
[1:47:32] Enoch told you about that job told you
[1:47:34] about this is what the life looks like
[1:47:37] and from there he was
[1:47:39] resurrected after he gave testimony
[1:47:42] right of the Judgment seat because he
[1:47:45] had become the Judgment seat of almighty
[1:47:48] God and the life was knocked out of the
[1:47:52] olive so that we could receive the oil
[1:47:55] we call it the Holy Ghost and that that
[1:47:58] oil can be lit by the fire of the lamp
[1:48:03] of the word of God we love you let's
[1:48:05] stand praise the
[1:48:08] Lord I love him this morning he's
