[33:43] let's tanzanite let's turn to the Book
[33:46] of Ruth in chapter 4
[34:17] Ruth chapter 4 and verse 13 so boaz took
[34:28] ruth and she was his wife and when he
[34:31] went in unto her the Lord gave her
[34:33] conception and she bare a son and the
[34:36] women said unto Naomi blessed be the
[34:38] Lord which hath not left thee this day
[34:39] without a kinsman that his name may be
[34:42] famous in Israel and he shall be under
[34:44] the ever store of thy life in the
[34:48] nurture of thine old age for the
[34:52] daughter-in-law which loveth thee which
[34:54] is better to thee than seven sons have
[34:56] borne him Galatians chapter 3 3 verse 13
[35:17] Christ hath redeemed us from the curse
[35:20] of the law being made a curse for us for
[35:22] it is written cursed is every one that
[35:24] hangeth on a tree that the blessings of
[35:26] Abraham might come on the Gentiles
[35:28] through Jesus Christ that we might
[35:30] receive the promise of the Spirit
[35:31] through faith brethren I speak after the
[35:35] manner of men though it be but a man's
[35:37] covenant edit fit be confirmed no man
[35:39] listen knoweth or added thereto now to
[35:42] Abraham and his seed where the promises
[35:44] made he saith not and to seeds as of
[35:46] many but as of one and to thy seed which
[35:49] is Christ Revelation chapter 5
[35:52] one last scripture and then we'll pray
[35:56] Revelation chapter 5 and verse 1 and I
[36:04] saw the right hand of him that sat on
[36:06] the throne a book written within and on
[36:09] the backside sealed with seven seals and
[36:11] I saw a strong angel proclaiming with a
[36:13] loud voice who was worthy to open the
[36:15] book and to loose the seals thereof and
[36:18] no man in heaven nor in earth neither
[36:20] under the earth was able to open the
[36:22] book neither to look thereon and I wept
[36:25] much because no man was found worthy to
[36:27] open and to read the book neither to
[36:29] thereon and one of the elders said unto
[36:33] me weep not behold the Lion of the tribe
[36:35] of Judah the root of David hath
[36:38] prevailed to open the book and to loose
[36:39] the seven seals thereof and I beheld and
[36:42] lo in the midst of the throne of the
[36:44] four beasts in the midst of the elders
[36:45] stood a lamb as it had been slain having
[36:48] seven horns and seven eyes which are the
[36:50] seven spirits of God sent forth into all
[36:52] the earth and he came and took the book
[36:54] out of the right hand of him that sat
[36:56] upon the throne let's bow our heads
[36:59] Heavenly Father Lord Jesus we come
[37:01] before you tonight Lord asking father
[37:03] that she would speak to us Lord father
[37:06] we are humanity Lord Jesus and father we
[37:09] have false lore but father we come into
[37:11] your presence Lord Jesus and and father
[37:14] we were reminded once again that we are
[37:15] not of this world father but we are
[37:17] children Lord of the kingdom of God that
[37:20] father we are Lord priests Lord Jesus
[37:23] and kings and queens father and father
[37:26] destined to rule Lord Jesus one of these
[37:28] days on the other side father and
[37:30] Lord here in this world that we live in
[37:32] Lord that we see death around us father
[37:34] yet we within us Lord the life father
[37:37] there is eternal life Lord Jesus and
[37:39] that is what's carrying us through
[37:41] father that is what's giving us Lord
[37:43] strength and courage Lord Jesus in the
[37:45] face of adversity Father glory asset
[37:47] tonight you would Lord has come down
[37:49] father orders you already feel your
[37:51] presence here Lord Jesus and you would
[37:53] connect with each one tonight father
[37:55] Lord those that are needy those that
[37:57] have desires of their heart or Jesus
[37:59] father I pray you'd come and meet those
[38:01] needs
[38:02] oh Jesus Lord give those desires or
[38:04] Jesus and father the cold father made
[38:07] you warm them Lord Jesus and father but
[38:09] you said he'd sew on fire tonight
[38:11] orotate pray that you take these words
[38:13] though Jesus now father and then bring
[38:15] them down to our hearts we pray in Jesus
[38:17] Christ's name Amen
[38:19] praise the Lord may be seated tonight
[38:25] amen so my title tonight his mercy built
[38:30] a bridge and my subtitle is not left
[38:34] without a kinsman Lord are you thankful
[38:39] tonight you were not left without a
[38:40] kinsman you know it I used to sometimes
[38:44] sometimes I have sermons where the title
[38:46] doesn't make sense they live variated
[38:48] and sometimes you have titles that give
[38:50] away your whole sermon raise the Lord
[38:53] but amen we read here in Ruth we read
[38:57] the end of the story
[38:58] Ruth is giving birth to Obed and the
[39:02] story of Ruth as we know is a is an
[39:04] example of the kinsman redeemer and then
[39:07] then Galatians I've short-term memory so
[39:12] I'm going to flip back to Galatians in
[39:14] Galatians uh I shouldn't confess that I
[39:17] don't have short-term memory loss I'm
[39:20] not gonna claim that Galatians chapter 3
[39:23] we read that Christ hath redeemed us
[39:26] from the curse of the law and we know
[39:28] that when Christ came and he died on
[39:30] Calvary and he had his ministry here on
[39:33] earth that that was the cross we went
[39:35] from the dispensation of the law the
[39:37] dispensation of grace and so there was a
[39:42] crossing over
[39:43] and God Christ hath redeemed us from the
[39:47] curse of the law because no man can can
[39:49] live by the law Paul said that you can't
[39:53] and he even had comfort conflict with
[39:56] Jews who were saying you know we we must
[39:58] stick by the law and and these Gentiles
[40:01] you can't bring them to church and they
[40:02] you know if they're gonna calm you know
[40:04] they they're trying to make you think it
[40:05] was Titus be circumcised and he's like
[40:07] look then none of that matters anymore
[40:08] because Christ has come and it's
[40:11] interesting and I just just because it's
[40:13] kind of the same thing that we have
[40:15] today we have people who are trying to
[40:17] to hold up and wait for brother Branham
[40:20] to come back and and they've lifted
[40:22] brother Branham up into a position like
[40:23] the Jews had lifted up the law and then
[40:26] they were putting the law above the
[40:28] working of Christ and but what the law
[40:30] did was the law was Christ's desire that
[40:35] for us to follow but he knew that there
[40:37] was no way any way that this could be
[40:40] met because it had to be a shed blood of
[40:42] an innocent I'm an innocent man and the
[40:45] blood of bulls and goats cannot save a
[40:46] man and so it had to be a kinsman
[40:48] redeemer had to be a another person but
[40:52] that person had to be born of a virgin
[40:55] he had to be pure and so God knew you
[40:57] you couldn't live the law but it was a
[40:59] type of what was to come and I'm the the
[41:03] Ministry of brother Branham it brought
[41:05] us to Christ and now that we've come to
[41:07] Christ the law brought the Jews to
[41:10] Christ but there it was now time to step
[41:13] into Christ and step into following
[41:16] Christ and not that you would step away
[41:17] from that because there's many things in
[41:19] the law that carried over but we eat
[41:22] bacon in the morning the Jews couldn't
[41:24] eat bacon right there are certain things
[41:26] that didn't follow over but the
[41:28] dispensation of grace of Christ coming
[41:30] down he was what was he doing he was
[41:32] introducing a relationship that we
[41:34] didn't have prior to that and when
[41:37] brother in the ministry brother Branham
[41:39] he came and introduced Christ to us and
[41:40] renewed that relationship that we have
[41:43] as mrs. Jesus Christ before that we had
[41:47] there was confusion but he was sent to
[41:49] tie up the loose ends as we know and so
[41:52] if we can go all the way back to the
[41:54] beginning in the Garden of Eden
[41:56] and begin to look at this this picture
[41:59] of the kinsman redeemer and we see that
[42:03] there a relationship was broken
[42:05] there was a relationship that God had
[42:07] between Adam and Eve and God would come
[42:10] down in the cool of the evening and he
[42:12] would he would fellowship with Adam and
[42:14] Eve one-on-one they would be standing in
[42:17] the presence of God after the fall in
[42:19] the Garden of Eden you could not come
[42:21] into the presence of God except for the
[42:24] high priest could once a year but if he
[42:26] didn't have his steps in his bells and
[42:28] and everything just right God struck him
[42:30] dead there was no mercy there amen this
[42:34] relationship was broken by the fall of
[42:36] humanity amen we know that Eve she she
[42:39] took the word of the serpent over the
[42:41] Word of God and cause sin to be
[42:44] introduced into the human race and as
[42:47] Adam and Eve walked from the Garden of
[42:49] Eden all seemed lost and brother branham
[42:52] he kind of gives a good picture of it
[42:54] and it's a kind of a couple of
[42:56] paragraphs and I could probably say what
[42:58] he says here but I just love the way he
[43:00] describes what happens and it's in the
[43:02] cruelty of sin then penalty that it
[43:04] costs to rid sin from our lives 1953 he
[43:07] says so there I can imagine seeing that
[43:10] poor little Eve when she looked at Adam
[43:12] her long blonde hair hanging down her
[43:14] back those big bright blue eyes that
[43:16] looked like the skies where God had made
[43:18] them the tears pouring down mixing with
[43:21] the blood and the garments and flapping
[43:22] down around her body Eve Adam with his
[43:26] strong body caught her and leaned her
[43:27] over all on his bosom and there the
[43:30] tears mingling falling as it run through
[43:32] the sheep skins blood dripping down
[43:34] blood all the way there now he says you
[43:36] have to depart out of my presence amen I
[43:39] cannot imagine the grief that Adam and
[43:42] Eve must have been experiencing they
[43:43] hear the words of God say you must
[43:45] depart from my presence and then we have
[43:47] a hard enough time leaving sometimes the
[43:50] real Prestone presence of God in the
[43:52] church amen and we're sitting here and
[43:54] rejoining it and we know that presence
[43:56] is with us wherever we go but we have
[43:58] such a hard time leaving that imagine
[44:00] God coming down and saying you need to
[44:02] leave amen that's what they were
[44:05] experiencing and he says I if he goes on
[44:07] the stage as I can see even Adam with
[44:09] their
[44:09] arms around one another going moving out
[44:11] like this them old sheepskins flopping
[44:13] against their leg bloody beating on
[44:15] their leg then I can select space which
[44:18] was God God had no beginning of days
[44:20] ending of years he is forever and
[44:22] forever I can see all that great space
[44:24] begin to move together like this coming
[44:27] down to a funnel shape like that and it
[44:29] moved right down as he began to I that
[44:31] little couple going down through the
[44:33] Garden of Eden
[44:34] bloody skins flopping against their leg
[44:37] I guess you don't have the whole quote
[44:39] I'm sorry flopping against their leg he
[44:41] says he couldn't stand it God couldn't
[44:44] stand it and it moved down I'll move
[44:46] down to the very heart of God spelt
[44:48] l.o.v.e God so loved he just couldn't
[44:51] see them go he called him back he said
[44:53] I'm going to put enmity between your
[44:55] seed and Satan's seed then when that was
[44:58] done was that Calvary when God Himself
[45:01] came down through a woman born of a
[45:03] virgin so here's Adam and Eve walking
[45:05] from the Garden of Eden and then the
[45:07] relationship has been broken off but
[45:09] before they go God says wait I have a
[45:11] promise this we had in the Garden of
[45:13] Eden will return amen
[45:16] you caused the fall I will cause the
[45:19] resurrection and because even though it
[45:22] was our fault he didn't just cast it
[45:24] upon us and say now you need to fix the
[45:26] problem no we pay the price for that but
[45:29] God came along said you know what
[45:30] there's no party way it's impossible for
[45:34] them to bring themselves back to my
[45:36] through a relationship with me I have to
[45:39] go and rescue them I have to go and be
[45:42] their kinsman redeemer so as a deliverer
[45:44] walking from the garden Amen God gets in
[45:47] this promise says hey listen here I'm
[45:49] going to come back and put enmity
[45:51] between your seed and Satan's seed in
[45:53] other words you know bruise the head of
[45:55] the serpent and so we know that that was
[45:57] a promise given and no doubt Adam
[46:00] preached this to his kids as he as he
[46:01] grew older and to his grandchildren and
[46:03] then his great grandchildren and his
[46:05] great great grandchildren and perhaps
[46:07] when it came down to the time of the end
[46:10] of Adam's life and he was there and and
[46:14] he lived you know close to the time of I
[46:17] might get my math here wrong Noah or
[46:19] Enoch somewhere he died just before that
[46:21] Noah was
[46:22] young boy when Adam passed away but when
[46:24] he left he said he said it hasn't come
[46:26] yet but there's coming a time when God
[46:29] will restore what we lost in the Garden
[46:31] of Eden but at this time there was a
[46:33] split between Earth and heaven an
[46:36] uncrossable canyon had formed there was
[46:38] no way for us to cross over it but God
[46:43] gave a promise and only one person could
[46:45] bridge that gap you say well how was
[46:48] this set in place well from the
[46:50] beginning of time well before the
[46:51] beginning of time because God is eternal
[46:54] the price for sin has been always been
[46:57] blood of an innocent and so that is the
[47:01] price and God and when we see you John
[47:04] and he has the he has the vision and he
[47:07] sees that the the the I wish I had that
[47:10] scripture he sees John's looking and
[47:13] he's having the vision and he sees that
[47:15] that there's that there's no way help me
[47:20] out somebody know what that is that's
[47:21] top there in oh I read it Wow okay
[47:31] forgive me I thought I did praise the
[47:33] Lord and I saw a strong angel
[47:35] proclaiming with a loud voice who is
[47:36] worthy to open the book and I wept much
[47:39] because no man was found worthy why
[47:40] because it had to be a virgin born man
[47:42] but John is standing there like that's
[47:44] impossible that's an impossible thing
[47:46] who can do this who can be worthy and he
[47:49] said and the Bible says that that he
[47:53] says before the Lion of the tribe of
[47:55] Judah and he says in the behave in the
[47:58] midst of it he saw a lamb as it had been
[48:00] slain a man that lamb was the Lion of
[48:04] the tribe of Judah and so but here is
[48:06] John and he's weeping because it's
[48:09] impossible for this gap to be bridged
[48:12] amen mercy built a bridge and he's
[48:16] seeing Hey look at this we need this
[48:20] Redemption plan notice it was sealed
[48:25] with seven seals which is the book of
[48:26] redemption
[48:27] we need this Redemption plan but who is
[48:30] worthy who can come and open the book
[48:33] and so the
[48:35] says do not weep John the Lion of the
[48:37] tribe of Judah in other words crowd God
[48:40] came down born of a virgin born perfect
[48:43] spotless lamb and gave His life on
[48:46] Calvary and I I degress I'm repeating
[48:48] myself tonight this stuff we already
[48:50] know but brother now says in 1960 the
[48:52] kinsman redeemer he says all the law of
[48:55] redemption is this that before a man
[48:57] could redeem of lost property he had to
[49:00] be the nearest kinsman and the next
[49:02] thing he had to be an upright man a just
[49:04] man to do it and then he had to be worth
[49:07] enough money to do it and then he had to
[49:09] make a public testimony that he had done
[49:11] it and from then on it was his property
[49:14] amen praise the Lord here's the catch
[49:19] though you were already his property
[49:22] before the foundation of the world the
[49:24] redemption plan had been had been acted
[49:27] upon and what does that mean that means
[49:32] that he was already set up so no matter
[49:37] what Adam and Eve did God had to come
[49:41] back in and bring his word to pass just
[49:44] like the fact that you will overcome
[49:47] Laodicea and you will stand upon the
[49:49] other side and walk their streets of
[49:50] gold as a promise set before you were
[49:52] born
[49:53] set before the world was born set before
[49:55] God put a little Hickey in in eternity
[49:59] the hill hickey of time brother BAM says
[50:00] before that was ever happened your story
[50:03] was already written so there's nothing
[50:05] that devil can do because guess what the
[50:07] devil knows your story and he's trying
[50:09] to bluff to you and say there's no way
[50:10] that you can make this there's no way
[50:12] you can do it you need to feed on the
[50:14] world you need to enjoy the world while
[50:16] you're here because you're going to die
[50:17] one of these days and you're not going
[50:18] to have the opportunity but the thing of
[50:20] it is is your story's already being
[50:22] written and tonight I'm going to tell
[50:24] you that the ending is better than you
[50:27] can imagine better than anything this
[50:29] world can offer our end our end on this
[50:33] world is just the beginning
[50:34] amen praise the Lord so now we have we
[50:38] have this Redemption plan set in place
[50:41] here tonight and and we have our title
[50:43] mercy built a bridge and so we look at
[50:45] the story of Ruth now Ruth was a type of
[50:48] the bride
[50:49] and Boaz was a type of Christ and just a
[50:52] little tidbit Boaz was actually part
[50:54] Gentile because his mother was Rahab the
[50:56] harlot and so he was half Jew half
[50:59] Gentile and so we see that we you can
[51:03] read the Book of Ruth and you go home
[51:05] tonight or tomorrow morning read it in
[51:07] your devotions and you see that that at
[51:11] the very beginning we see the fault of
[51:13] humanity and once again this is the
[51:15] story of redemption but the redemption
[51:18] and the rescue me needed was done they
[51:20] were they were put in that position
[51:22] because of their own fault just like
[51:24] Adam and Eve and so it's just incredible
[51:27] and it's the grace of God that we put
[51:29] ourselves in their situations and God
[51:31] comes along and he brings us out of him
[51:33] amen he doesn't say oh you know you fell
[51:37] down you pick yourself up and you knock
[51:39] it off and knock us around no he says
[51:41] let me he extends a hand down into the
[51:43] miry clay and pulls us up because he
[51:45] knows amen that there's no way you can
[51:48] do it of yourself amen you need Christ
[51:51] and that's because the the weapons and
[51:53] the onion or the wet excuse me the
[51:56] warfare that we are caught up in Amen is
[51:59] beyond what we as humans can do they are
[52:02] what the flesh man can do that's why we
[52:03] needed the kinsman redeemer Amen it's
[52:06] the only way for us to fight that evil
[52:08] of this age is with the blood of Jesus
[52:11] Christ and so Naomi goes with her
[52:13] husband and Roo and her two sons and
[52:16] they go to Moab and her son's married to
[52:19] Moabite his women Ruth and Opa Opa Opa
[52:25] or fuh whatever and we know the story
[52:28] the husband and the Naomi's husband and
[52:31] her sons died and she says she tells
[52:34] orbits us to stay behind and Ruth to
[52:36] stay behind Ruth says no I must go with
[52:39] you so Ruth goes with Naomi now the
[52:41] thing here is that Naomi now has no
[52:44] access to her inheritance
[52:46] she has an inheritance with without
[52:48] someone to carry on the name to carry on
[52:51] the line amen she has she she has no she
[52:56] has lost her claim on her inheritance
[52:58] and so she has to have seed to raise up
[53:01] to
[53:02] her inheritance otherwise when she
[53:04] passed away it would be the end of it
[53:06] and so um she says hey Ruth she says hey
[53:10] there's this guy his name's Boaz and
[53:12] he's got a nice farm he's an older man
[53:15] but he's single sometimes you older ones
[53:21] are well-established you marry make me
[53:25] my wife we got married we were young we
[53:27] both had a lot of growing up to do we
[53:28] still do we still do but my goodness you
[53:31] should have seen this then but we should
[53:35] have a lot to do a lot of growing up to
[53:36] do but anyways here's Boaz man we don't
[53:40] know boys his story perhaps he he you
[53:43] know he just never found himself a girl
[53:46] but he's got a farm and he's got people
[53:48] that work for him so he's has to be a
[53:50] little bit older and so he says no it
[53:53] says Ruth listen go on down to the field
[53:55] and I'm going glean and so when the when
[53:57] it was harvest time and they would
[53:59] harvest the grain there would be pieces
[54:01] that fell down and by the wayside and
[54:03] they didn't go back and pick them up at
[54:05] it was part of the tradition in the law
[54:07] I think you can read it in there where I
[54:10] had to be left so that it could be
[54:12] gleaned by the people that were poor and
[54:14] so she says go glean and so boys sees
[54:17] this young beautiful girl Ruth and he
[54:19] says hey um he asks his guys he said who
[54:22] is this this girl over here and it's oh
[54:25] that's Naomi's daughter-in-law and he
[54:28] says oh wow cheating you because Boaz
[54:30] was related to the homie and um he says
[54:33] drop a little extra for her and so um
[54:37] now Ruth comes back and then she says
[54:40] look Naomi I've got you know look how
[54:42] much grain I got and she goes wow how
[54:45] you know how how you know Boaz has shown
[54:48] them favor towards you so here's what
[54:52] you do tonight go lay at his feet go
[54:55] sneak in to the threshing floor and lay
[54:57] at his feet and so boys sneaks it excuse
[55:03] me Ruth sneaks in there and she lays
[55:05] down she pulls a little cover over her
[55:06] about his feet and boys wakes up and he
[55:10] goes who's there she does its
[55:13] Ruth and it was okay she says I need you
[55:17] to play the kinsman Naomi's your is your
[55:19] cousin or your relation and she needs we
[55:24] need you to play the kinsman redeemer or
[55:27] the the for the inheritance and so he
[55:30] says hey I'll take care of this matter
[55:31] just rest
[55:33] amen and so um Boaz says well okay look
[55:37] there's one person that's closer and
[55:39] I'll go and talk to talk to him now the
[55:41] catch was the guy was like sure I'll
[55:43] take you know all of the the property
[55:46] and everything of Naomi and this
[55:47] inheritance and he says well but you
[55:49] have to take Ruth and he says well I
[55:51] can't take Ruth because it'll Mar my own
[55:53] testimony and because he already had
[55:58] perhaps a wife and stuffer or whatever
[56:01] reason it was going to Moorish testimony
[56:02] says I can't take the Ruth with that and
[56:05] so he boys says okay then I'll be the
[56:08] kinsman I'll be the Redeemer and the
[56:10] near kinsman and I will do the act of of
[56:12] claiming this inheritance and so Boaz
[56:16] takes Ruth to to his to be his wife and
[56:19] mm-hmm and prayers Lord and so while he
[56:27] is doing his part in the army tells Ruth
[56:29] she says look rest sit still for for he
[56:32] will not rest until he has done this
[56:34] thing today and amen you are called to
[56:39] rest rest that that that God will come
[56:42] and and he will do this thing today well
[56:44] God Christ has already done it he's
[56:47] already given that been their kinsman
[56:49] redeemer and I'm but but still
[56:51] God says NAIP rest
[56:54] I am your Redeemer I have taken care of
[56:57] this for you now rest and that is what
[56:59] you know the Sabbath before the
[57:01] disposition of the law was it was a day
[57:04] but now once Christ has come we have an
[57:06] internal Sabbath we have eternal rest in
[57:08] Christ because why he's taking care of
[57:11] that part for us he said he can care of
[57:14] the restoration and so Boaz does the
[57:17] part of the kinsman men but before there
[57:20] could be a relationship between Boaz and
[57:22] Ruth first he had to be her kinsman
[57:25] redeemer
[57:25] redeeming the inheritor
[57:27] of Naomi now once the part of the
[57:30] kinsman redeemer was played once Boaz
[57:32] took care of that then they could become
[57:35] husband and wife amen Christ had to be
[57:38] your kinsman redeemer before you could
[57:41] become mrs. Jesus Christ but we know
[57:43] that that God came amen and he brought
[57:46] me the word and he he became our kinsman
[57:48] redeemer amen and now with the that's
[57:51] why we need the full word manifested in
[57:55] our day because the seven seals is the
[57:58] full book of redemption and without the
[58:00] fullness of redemption you cannot have a
[58:04] fullness of relationship with Christ
[58:06] amen that's why it's so important and
[58:09] that's why the devil fights it so much
[58:10] because without the full plan of
[58:12] redemption there is no relationship no
[58:15] wife and husband relationship with
[58:17] Christ and without that without that
[58:21] relationship you cannot receive seed you
[58:26] have to receive the word seat a man
[58:29] without the seed even the foolish
[58:31] version has the seed did you know that
[58:33] for the band says she has the sea but
[58:35] not the moisture to make it grow so even
[58:38] the fullest version says they the seven
[58:40] seals and believes the opening of the
[58:42] word and receives the seed amen but
[58:45] there's something that happens along the
[58:46] way there they let the oil go out of
[58:49] their lamps
[58:50] praise the Lord but once there was
[58:53] restoration then she could receive seed
[58:55] of her Redeemer amen and through that we
[58:58] see the manifestation of that
[59:00] relationship in Obed and Obed means a
[59:03] worshiper and so once that once you come
[59:06] into a relationship with Christ God says
[59:09] I want to be worshipped he says we
[59:11] before those before the dawn of time God
[59:14] had a desire in his heart that he wanted
[59:16] to be worshiped Amen but true worship
[59:19] true worship can only come when you have
[59:22] back when you have that relationship
[59:25] with Christ and that promise that is
[59:27] born of the seed received from Christ
[59:30] that brings worship to God you say well
[59:34] I come to church and I lift my hands and
[59:36] I sing that's praise and there's nothing
[59:39] wrong with praise but when
[59:41] you connect with your Redeemer when you
[59:44] connect with your kinsman that is when
[59:47] real worship comes from your heart why
[59:51] because you have a revelation of who
[59:53] Christ is to you it's like when you have
[59:56] been between a husband and a wife when
[59:58] you know she loves you
[1:00:00] amen though there's the worship there
[1:00:02] there's a praise you you just saw you're
[1:00:04] so beautiful and you're not just saying
[1:00:06] those words you mean it down in your
[1:00:08] heart and you're just like I gotta say
[1:00:10] it cuz it's spilling out from inside of
[1:00:12] me and when you connect with Christ it's
[1:00:14] the same thing and that's what he's
[1:00:16] looking for
[1:00:17] he doesn't want or it was lip praise he
[1:00:20] doesn't want lip service he wants
[1:00:23] worship of your heart and the only way
[1:00:25] that can come as if you've gone into
[1:00:28] that secret place with Christ amen Boaz
[1:00:31] and Ruth did not did not come together
[1:00:35] as husband and wife in the open they
[1:00:38] came together suppose even wife in the
[1:00:39] secret place amen the secret place and
[1:00:42] that's where you that's where the full
[1:00:45] redemption plan that's why the Seventh
[1:00:47] Seal the third pool it's a secret it's a
[1:00:49] secret because it's Christ its Christ
[1:00:54] revealing himself to you
[1:00:57] amen not nothing not just of the Bible
[1:01:01] and scriptures and the message as words
[1:01:03] and quotes but but but something it's
[1:01:06] between the lines amen when you connect
[1:01:08] you know when you have a love for your
[1:01:11] wife but the brand uses an example you
[1:01:13] know you get a letter from her oh I put
[1:01:15] the kids to bed and I you know I did
[1:01:17] this and I clean the house and
[1:01:19] everything and we miss you you just read
[1:01:20] I love you I love you I love you I love
[1:01:23] you I can't wait to see you I can't wait
[1:01:25] to hold you and give you a hug give you
[1:01:27] a kiss and that's what you and you were
[1:01:29] when you that's why devotions it can't
[1:01:31] just be like reading a newspaper you say
[1:01:34] I am you know as a young kid I so you
[1:01:36] know what's how do you relieve the Bible
[1:01:38] without reading it like a newspaper and
[1:01:40] then you know as you get older and you
[1:01:42] grow up you begin to understand things
[1:01:43] and hopefully and and you realize that
[1:01:49] that when you read it and you're
[1:01:51] connected you're in his presence then
[1:01:54] he's speaking to you through his word
[1:01:55] now the same thing happened you UVI as a
[1:01:59] as me as chris i can't preach about the
[1:02:03] kinsman redeemer without bringing up
[1:02:05] abraham and sarah because it's such a
[1:02:07] perfect story
[1:02:09] amen that they have been to give been
[1:02:11] given a promised son amen you as
[1:02:13] children of Abraham have been given a
[1:02:16] promise son amen and that promise was
[1:02:19] was Christ and so so once Abraham and
[1:02:23] Sarah received a body change you
[1:02:27] received the body change you're not the
[1:02:28] same person you were before so Saul
[1:02:31] became Paul he had a body change now
[1:02:34] with that body change then it was then
[1:02:37] but then Christ comes he introduces
[1:02:39] himself to to Abraham as on the backside
[1:02:43] of the desert and he says hey I will
[1:02:46] visit you according to the time of life
[1:02:48] and you shall receive a son you are
[1:02:50] introduced to Christ you receive your
[1:02:52] body change then you're introduced to
[1:02:54] Christ excuse me and then God comes down
[1:02:59] and he says and then he gives you the
[1:03:03] seed and then he gives you that that
[1:03:05] that promise son and then you bring what
[1:03:07] do you bring forth what do you bear
[1:03:10] forth what's growing inside of you what
[1:03:12] you a woman can't be pregnant without
[1:03:16] everyone noticing right because that
[1:03:17] belly just grows on out there right you
[1:03:20] can't receive the seed of Christ Old
[1:03:22] Glory tonight you can't receive this
[1:03:24] feet of Christ without some kind of
[1:03:26] physical physical manifestation and then
[1:03:30] people are gonna know you've been with
[1:03:32] Christ people are gonna know there's
[1:03:34] something changed inside of you and then
[1:03:37] there's something working inside of you
[1:03:39] and guess what you don't go from from
[1:03:42] zero from one week to twenty week
[1:03:44] overnight you don't show that fast it's
[1:03:47] a process it's a process but guess what
[1:03:50] amen my wife she can't speed the process
[1:03:53] along and she might want to but she
[1:03:56] can't speed it along Amen she's got a
[1:03:58] bear sometimes you have to bear the pain
[1:04:01] of bearing Christ sometimes you have to
[1:04:04] go through hard
[1:04:05] shift and you wake up in the morning and
[1:04:07] you're sick and you don't feel like a
[1:04:09] Christian and you feel pregnant but you
[1:04:12] just said what's wrong with me amen you
[1:04:15] become pregnant with the Word of God and
[1:04:17] then you start to have problems you
[1:04:20] start to have you start to get sick what
[1:04:24] and I'm not sick and in the natural body
[1:04:27] and not sick in the spiritual body but
[1:04:28] things aren't going well it's harder to
[1:04:31] move around amen and the closer you get
[1:04:34] amen praise the Lord the closer you get
[1:04:36] or the full manifestation amen the full
[1:04:40] manifestation of what you have received
[1:04:42] the harder it gets to move around the
[1:04:45] harder it gets to - to do your daily
[1:04:49] duties in man the harder it gets for
[1:04:51] Christian to keep the house clean and
[1:04:52] the kitchen clean the harder it gets for
[1:04:54] you to get up in the morning and commit
[1:04:56] time the devotion but God says I need
[1:04:58] that of you I need you to keep that
[1:05:01] relationship amen I need you to hold on
[1:05:04] to that because guess what you're
[1:05:05] experiencing growing birth pains because
[1:05:08] you're getting closer and closer to the
[1:05:11] full manifestation sons of God amen the
[1:05:14] earth groaneth and travaileth for the
[1:05:16] manifestation of the sons of God amen as
[1:05:19] you see the coronavirus and and and the
[1:05:22] fires in Australia and the world growing
[1:05:25] what is getting closer and closer what -
[1:05:28] the manifestation of the sons of God
[1:05:31] praise the Lord praise the Lord Amen
[1:05:36] well what happened there was a chasm
[1:05:39] between this you needed this to become a
[1:05:41] true worshiper of Christ you need this
[1:05:44] seed if in you in order for you to
[1:05:47] become a son of God and the daughter of
[1:05:49] God but there was a chasm an uncrossable
[1:05:52] kratom chasm but tonight Amen I'm here
[1:05:55] to tell you mercy built a bridge across
[1:05:58] that chasm amen it was in God's grace
[1:06:01] and God's mercy that he returned and
[1:06:03] became our Redeemer praise the Lord
[1:06:07] amen and this see that you're receiving
[1:06:10] Amen this seed is the original seed
[1:06:13] originals means meaning nothing came
[1:06:16] before it
[1:06:18] praise the Lord
[1:06:19] and the first atom in the first Eve amen
[1:06:24] the receive the seed she received of
[1:06:27] Adam was not original he said something
[1:06:31] came before it but God says that will
[1:06:34] not happen again
[1:06:35] I will give her the original seed so the
[1:06:38] second Adam comes and before anything
[1:06:42] can get to that God comes down and gives
[1:06:44] that seed so now she has now you have
[1:06:49] this seed and you are sealed the room is
[1:06:52] sealed Amen once that mm-hmm
[1:06:54] there's just there's just a small space
[1:06:56] of time amen were if a woman were to
[1:06:59] take it you know the story of the babies
[1:07:02] she had two babies one was black on his
[1:07:03] white she you know had was with her
[1:07:06] husband in the morning with some other
[1:07:07] guy that night but once you get past
[1:07:09] that period of time no matter what you
[1:07:12] what you tried to do I mean you cannot
[1:07:14] give that pregnant woman another child
[1:07:17] because she's her womb has been sealed
[1:07:20] and so God comes and he seals you now
[1:07:23] you're sealed unto the day of your
[1:07:25] redemption in other words you can't
[1:07:27] receive any other idea Amen there's a
[1:07:30] sister out in Alaska she is in in a
[1:07:33] village all by herself
[1:07:35] and she received a mess of the hour and
[1:07:37] God really set her on fire
[1:07:39] I think it's Quinta Hawk is where she's
[1:07:42] at and um her family was really
[1:07:45] concerned you know she became this
[1:07:47] Brandon mite so they go online and they
[1:07:48] search up all the bad stuff about
[1:07:50] brother Branham they bring her you know
[1:07:51] all these pages says you need to read
[1:07:53] this you need to look and she goes I
[1:07:55] don't need to look it's already too late
[1:07:58] she's like I can read it but it's not
[1:08:00] gonna do anything because I've already
[1:08:02] been sealed amen and that's what's going
[1:08:04] to get you there and so if you have not
[1:08:06] yet gone into that secret place praise
[1:08:09] the Lord you need to do something
[1:08:11] whether Branham says in spoken word is
[1:08:12] original see in 1962 he says what time
[1:08:18] did I start
[1:08:21] I feel like I'm going too fast Bray's
[1:08:24] Lauren he says um he says them before
[1:08:27] they came together Adam and Eve she was
[1:08:29] pregnant with the corrupt seed from the
[1:08:30] serpent and when Adam come to his wife
[1:08:33] he found her pregnant it to death see
[1:08:34] death how spiritually and physically
[1:08:37] dead but when Joseph the human come to
[1:08:40] his wife glory says can't hardly hold
[1:08:42] her she was pregnant with life
[1:08:44] I mean it's harder to get your arms
[1:08:45] around your wife when she's full of
[1:08:47] pretty fully pregnant where's Lauren the
[1:08:50] Word of God and flesh in her womb bring
[1:08:52] back that spoken word bring back that
[1:08:54] Word of God which was word here come
[1:08:56] through a human's womb amen God will do
[1:08:58] it anyhow he spoke it and it's got to be
[1:09:00] so amen that's our God all that's rich
[1:09:03] brethren if you can dissolve in if you
[1:09:05] can hit it that's where he found when
[1:09:06] Adam come to his wife she was pregnant
[1:09:08] with the wrong seed when Joseph that's
[1:09:11] he died but Joseph come to his wife she
[1:09:13] was pregnant now what caused the
[1:09:15] different preparation because that Adams
[1:09:16] wife doubted the word
[1:09:18] that's why Joseph's bride believed the
[1:09:20] word that's the difference to read Amen
[1:09:22] if you read when when Mary was was given
[1:09:25] the word you will bear a child and then
[1:09:29] she's like how I have been with no man
[1:09:30] the Holy Spirit overshadow of you and
[1:09:33] then she had a chance to reject it Eve
[1:09:35] was given the word don't go speak to the
[1:09:37] don't go over to the street don't go
[1:09:40] talk to them Eve had a choice as well do
[1:09:42] I accept this this this um do I accept
[1:09:46] this or do I reject this and and Mary
[1:09:48] had the same choice do I accept it or do
[1:09:51] I reject it and you see Eve made the
[1:09:53] wrong choice and she accepted the wrong
[1:09:56] seed and but Mary accepted the right
[1:09:58] seed amen and because of that Amen we
[1:10:01] were a God was able to bridge the gap
[1:10:04] amen praise the Lord and we see that he
[1:10:08] comes down amen on the day of Pentecost
[1:10:12] and now you have people running around
[1:10:15] talking like crazy people to the rest of
[1:10:18] the the city you know these guys are
[1:10:20] full of new wine and he says Peter gets
[1:10:23] up and says you know we're not we've
[1:10:25] received the Holy Ghost and the power
[1:10:27] from on high
[1:10:28] listen that shook the world at the time
[1:10:31] men we we we in this day and age you
[1:10:33] know that
[1:10:34] the anointing of the Holy Ghost and then
[1:10:36] the moving of the Spirit of God has been
[1:10:37] so given a bad name across the world
[1:10:42] over because of religion but in this in
[1:10:45] that time in that age had never been
[1:10:47] known before
[1:10:48] Amen they didn't know what this spirit
[1:10:50] was what this Holy Spirit was amen and
[1:10:53] God giving that gift to them prison Lord
[1:10:56] and then he came back in our days and he
[1:10:58] gives us that same gift again and he
[1:11:01] brings back all these things together so
[1:11:03] that we now with the Holy Ghost can go
[1:11:06] into the holiest of Holies because prior
[1:11:08] to that day man it had to be the high
[1:11:10] priest had to be someone else going for
[1:11:12] you in animat but now Christ is our high
[1:11:15] priest
[1:11:15] praise the Lord but with God all things
[1:11:18] are possible and the same God that built
[1:11:21] a bridge across to what seemed an
[1:11:23] uncrossable Canyon to restore the bride
[1:11:26] of Jesus Christ
[1:11:27] so can his mercy build a bridge over the
[1:11:30] canyon you face and the Lord's been
[1:11:33] dealing with my heart and I've been I've
[1:11:35] been saying Laura you know I just I just
[1:11:36] really and we always desire to draw
[1:11:39] closer to God but lately I've just been
[1:11:41] yearning and desiring though I just want
[1:11:43] to I just want to you know wrap myself
[1:11:45] in I just want to crawl inside of you
[1:11:47] and I I want to get as much as I can of
[1:11:49] you and so in the office tonight I was
[1:11:51] praying and that burden was on my heart
[1:11:54] Lord I desire to be closer to you I
[1:11:56] desire a relationship with you
[1:11:58] amen and God spoke to my heart I said
[1:12:00] well Mercy's built a bridge so if you
[1:12:02] have that gap that can form Amen let's
[1:12:05] be real tonight the cares of life come
[1:12:07] in things happen and sometimes a little
[1:12:09] gap forms between you and God but God
[1:12:12] but mercy has built the bridge and so
[1:12:14] Gus as God came down and bridge the gap
[1:12:17] between humanity and himself and so even
[1:12:20] that same mercy can restore and bring
[1:12:23] you back amen across that relationship
[1:12:25] across that chasm that's formed in your
[1:12:27] relationship with Christ and you can be
[1:12:29] really reunited with that amen but you
[1:12:32] see but you see it always comes down to
[1:12:34] this as Christians it always comes down
[1:12:37] to a choice free moral agency and it
[1:12:40] always comes down to steps um
[1:12:44] foot steps is possessions there's a
[1:12:47] bridge
[1:12:48] for you to cross but you have to walk
[1:12:50] across it amen
[1:12:52] you have to go across then you know what
[1:12:55] I've been thinking about the children of
[1:12:57] Israel and how when when when they all
[1:13:01] crossed over the river Jordan underneath
[1:13:03] the Ministry of Joshua God parted the
[1:13:05] waters amen but when Joshua and Caleb
[1:13:08] and the other 10 spies when they went to
[1:13:10] seek out the land and they went to go on
[1:13:12] to the promised land they had to wade
[1:13:14] through the waters amen not there's a
[1:13:16] song and and perhaps I'll sing it
[1:13:19] sometime but it says sometimes when I
[1:13:21] asked you to part the waters you asked
[1:13:24] me to wade through them and sometimes
[1:13:26] when I asked you to move the mountains
[1:13:27] you asked me to climb over them and many
[1:13:30] times we just expect God to move
[1:13:32] everything out of her way but sometimes
[1:13:34] sometimes he says look I want you to
[1:13:36] walk over this one right now I want you
[1:13:39] to cross this river right now he says
[1:13:41] but mercy has built a bridge and so even
[1:13:44] though you have to cross the water God's
[1:13:46] gonna give you everything you need to
[1:13:48] move across the water even if he calls
[1:13:51] you to climb the mountain and when God's
[1:13:53] gonna give you the strength you need to
[1:13:55] climb the mountain so even in the hard
[1:13:57] times Amen God always provides what you
[1:14:00] need to overcome even what's in front of
[1:14:03] you amen
[1:14:05] and nothing can waiver you nothing can
[1:14:07] move you aside and maybe because of the
[1:14:09] seed that's down in your heart amen when
[1:14:13] the Bible says the gates of Hell cannot
[1:14:14] prevail against it it's speaking of that
[1:14:17] seed in your heart as soon as you think
[1:14:19] you can walk up as a human and take the
[1:14:21] gates of Hell and rattled him and then
[1:14:23] you have another thing coming but as
[1:14:25] soon as you identify say as a child of
[1:14:28] God and meant a seed of Christ in me
[1:14:30] they managed through the true Christ
[1:14:32] that I walk and I stay stay stay the
[1:14:36] course
[1:14:36] praise the Lord amen amen the power of
[1:14:43] Christ's life that lives in that seed
[1:14:45] you have been pregnant with will
[1:14:47] overcome amen and the hour of need you
[1:14:52] will not be left without a kinsman amen
[1:14:56] mercy built a bridge amen not left with
[1:15:01] out of kinsman in your hour of need
[1:15:03] whatever it would be a man you have a
[1:15:05] kinsman you have a redeemer every
[1:15:07] promise amen every promise in the book
[1:15:10] is mine listen God wouldn't give a
[1:15:12] promise well God wouldn't give a promise
[1:15:15] and not keep it but God wouldn't give a
[1:15:17] promise that you would never need how
[1:15:22] could God manifest himself you know the
[1:15:26] age-old question well if if if there's a
[1:15:28] God why does evil happen a God needed
[1:15:31] needed to express himself he says you
[1:15:35] know I want to be a savior well you
[1:15:37] can't be a savior unless you have
[1:15:39] someone to save God says I want to be a
[1:15:42] healer but he can't be a healer unless
[1:15:46] there's someone sick God says I want to
[1:15:49] be your strength giver but he can't give
[1:15:52] strength unless there's someone that is
[1:15:53] weak and when you're always walking down
[1:15:56] a rosy path you don't need strength so
[1:16:01] God can manifest his attributes in you
[1:16:03] so God says you know what I want to I
[1:16:06] want to draw from my child some more
[1:16:10] worship I want to draw from them a
[1:16:12] greater relationship so I'm gonna have
[1:16:14] them cross the water I'm gonna have them
[1:16:16] climb the mountain and when you when you
[1:16:19] go through those things it breaks you
[1:16:22] down
[1:16:22] I mean God loveth a spirit SATA or broke
[1:16:27] a broken spirit and or broken heart and
[1:16:29] I can't remember the scripture contract
[1:16:31] spirit you man God love God loves it
[1:16:33] when you're broke down and your humble
[1:16:36] because something in you changes
[1:16:38] something you changes you you realize
[1:16:41] that you realize that you can't do this
[1:16:43] you realize that you have no ability and
[1:16:46] and and the thing this is when you think
[1:16:48] you have ability we're just we're going
[1:16:52] tonight I mean we're walk we're we're
[1:16:54] moved past our notes we're just going
[1:16:56] with this tonight and then if it's all
[1:16:58] over the place you just pick them up it
[1:16:59] you want it's a buffet good night and so
[1:17:03] and so and you can overeat and so um God
[1:17:10] says you know um you're going through
[1:17:12] these things and yeah and you broke down
[1:17:14] on your
[1:17:14] I have to find out where I was praise
[1:17:16] the Lord amen and God's been dealing
[1:17:20] with your heart and and your broken and
[1:17:22] your engine your humble then something
[1:17:23] changed within you and you when you
[1:17:25] begin to realize you can't do it on your
[1:17:27] own
[1:17:27] then you allow God to come and work
[1:17:29] because what does brother Branham say
[1:17:31] throughout the message he says he says
[1:17:34] you have to deal with your self we'll
[1:17:38] God won't come and just take yourself
[1:17:40] well out of the way your pride just gets
[1:17:44] in the way
[1:17:44] constantly and you think well I'm not a
[1:17:47] prideful person or pride manifests in
[1:17:49] many different ways
[1:17:50] amen and um and pride can come from
[1:17:55] bitterness but the Bible says bitterness
[1:17:58] is the root of all evil and if you study
[1:18:02] out complexes and stuff that people get
[1:18:06] you'll be amazed at how almost all of
[1:18:09] them go back to Pride and bitterness
[1:18:12] well they have you know they they they
[1:18:14] they have that you know this person they
[1:18:16] have they're scared at that that people
[1:18:18] don't like them all the time because
[1:18:21] because you know they're maybe there was
[1:18:23] a situation and someone didn't like him
[1:18:26] anymore and now they're there they're
[1:18:28] afraid to to put themselves out there
[1:18:30] and to be a friend because they don't
[1:18:33] want to be hurt again amen they're not
[1:18:35] willing to sacrifice and people with
[1:18:37] pride aren't willing to sacrifice you
[1:18:40] know a man that's proud of his of his
[1:18:43] his um his Beamer or his his Ferrari I
[1:18:47] mean he's not gonna throw it on the line
[1:18:49] to save somebody generally speaking a
[1:18:52] man he's not gonna throw it on the line
[1:18:54] to do something but someone who has a
[1:18:56] him who is without pride he says and
[1:18:59] there's good pride as I if I can say
[1:19:04] that tonight I mean you can be proud to
[1:19:05] be a Christian and then in the right way
[1:19:07] right context a humble peace humble
[1:19:10] confidence amen which isn't pride it's
[1:19:14] confidence but praise the Lord and so
[1:19:16] and so you you don't have pride then
[1:19:19] then you're willing to go down and get
[1:19:22] in the mud with your brother and get in
[1:19:24] the mud with your sister and you say
[1:19:27] you know what I they need my help but
[1:19:30] I'm gonna just swallow my pride I'm not
[1:19:32] gonna worry about my suit I'm gonna get
[1:19:35] it muddy because it can be replaced and
[1:19:37] that's a natural example and sometimes
[1:19:40] people you know they they shy away from
[1:19:43] being used by God because they're afraid
[1:19:45] to get a little bit of mud on their
[1:19:47] jeans a little bit of mud on their knees
[1:19:49] amen but sometimes you know you have
[1:19:51] that person in line at Starbucks or you
[1:19:54] have that person in line at the grocery
[1:19:57] store and they look like they came from
[1:19:59] the pit of hell
[1:20:00] and the last thing you want to do is
[1:20:02] talk to them but God sometimes those are
[1:20:06] the people who know what they are and
[1:20:09] know they need God but think there's no
[1:20:14] hope for them but you got to get dirty
[1:20:16] you have to hear you know you got to
[1:20:19] talk to them and you know what you can
[1:20:21] shy away sometimes because you have too
[1:20:23] much pride in your life that was a super
[1:20:25] tangent praise the Lord amen well that
[1:20:30] was for somebody a shot in the dark my
[1:20:34] brother
[1:20:35] Dale Smith he said some one time and he
[1:20:39] says almost be a shot at dark whoever
[1:20:41] else someone on the Internet
[1:20:43] praise the Lord Amen will close here
[1:20:48] tonight the sister II mean musician is
[1:20:50] gonna come praise the Lord so Mercy's
[1:20:53] built a bridge any situation you face in
[1:20:56] life amen
[1:20:57] a mirror I mention I mentioned it before
[1:20:59] but in any day you get up and you have
[1:21:02] nothing else to be thankful for you can
[1:21:03] be thankful Amen that that you have a
[1:21:06] kinsman redeemer you can be thankful
[1:21:07] that God has called you and God has
[1:21:09] filled you with the Holy Ghost and
[1:21:11] anytime you face a problem instead of
[1:21:14] instead of trying to build your own
[1:21:16] bridge remember there's already one
[1:21:19] there you just have to walk across you
[1:21:23] just have to walk across it Bible says
[1:21:25] foot steps is possessions amen every
[1:21:28] promise of God is there for you to take
[1:21:31] but you have to take it you have to
[1:21:35] stand up God said the job he said gird
[1:21:41] yourself
[1:21:42] stand up like a man I'm going to speak
[1:21:45] to you and just because God reaches down
[1:21:49] and helps us up sometimes that reaching
[1:21:52] hand is hey boy stand up kick in the
[1:21:58] pants if I had can have the liberty to
[1:22:01] say that sometimes that's what God
[1:22:03] doesn't and that that does doesn't
[1:22:04] always feel good and that doesn't you
[1:22:07] know but don't get upset just stand up
[1:22:10] and say yes sir I'm listening
[1:22:12] praise the Lord and um amen
[1:22:17] wow the president of lupus is so nice
[1:22:19] here tonight and you get a preacher and
[1:22:21] anointed and in the presence you know
[1:22:23] he'll talk all night and that jabber on
[1:22:26] but I don't want to I don't want to get
[1:22:28] lost in tangents and but if if I could
[1:22:33] just say one more thing tonight I mean
[1:22:36] why don't you book her head like this
[1:22:38] God is here and and I'm not one to put
[1:22:41] anything on God will do that God is
[1:22:46] sovereign and and when he comes he comes
[1:22:50] sovereignly and you can't fake it you
[1:22:54] can be caught up in emotion sometimes
[1:22:56] and and read the Rev every Rev your self
[1:22:59] up and Rev the people up but but then
[1:23:01] they walk away and they that there's an
[1:23:03] emptiness because it was emotions but I
[1:23:05] believe tonight and in just and
[1:23:07] sovereignty God is common and perhaps
[1:23:10] there's a gap between you and Christ you
[1:23:14] and your relationship I'm not talking
[1:23:16] about well it could be anything I know
[1:23:21] in my heart I say Lord I I let work get
[1:23:24] me caught up and and and and lord I
[1:23:26] wanna I want a close relationship with
[1:23:28] you and so if you're with me tonight my

[1:24:07] feelings may we sense that presence near

[1:24:12] that faith and father just draw even
[1:24:15] closer to you father though the world
