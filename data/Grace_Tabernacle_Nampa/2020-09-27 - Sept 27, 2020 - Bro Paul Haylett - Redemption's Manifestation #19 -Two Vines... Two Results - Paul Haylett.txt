to his day all may change but jesus never glory to his name can we say amen to that all glory to his beautiful precious name amen we also want to remember uh brother sergey and his family brother alex i think they're not feeling well today also so a little fin in numbers this morning but just pray that god would just touch each and every one who is not here amen just look around you and if you see someone you normally see in and you don't see them this morning just say a prayer for them amen hallelujah well just good to be in the house of the lord today amen uh thanking the lord for his grace and mercy now i want to just bring forth uh in this thought i often mention uh uh certain things and there are things that resonate with me as we have saw through the years uh you know saints i guess i'd put it this way you know i didn't always serve the lord with all my heart mind body and soul but i was not by god's grace completely oblivious to what was happening in the world around me and you get to see these things and the prophet of god told us that through the ages those spirits don't die right so we're dealing with every spirit right now that's been on the face of the earth through the ages amen and some people say well now you know are we more special than they were you know in that first church age the day of pentecost no but my brother and sister there's been more demons released upon the earth but that word was magnified in the bride of this day amen so it's coming to life christ himself is a full manifestation is here in us we need to have that kind of confidence doesn't matter what's out there we were already predestinated and enabled amen to overcome that you know i just you know i'm not much of a technology person but we recently had bought a machine a harvester and and it wouldn't do certain things and it was beyond us and uh you know we finally had to call a technician and he come and hooked his laptop to it and i hope you see this uh point i'm trying to make and i'm i'm all concerned it's like they sold us something and it's supposed to have this and it doesn't it isn't there and as the technician put his laptop into the port and tied all into it he said oh he said it's all there it just hasn't been enabled and i thought thank you lord right there it's all the prophet of god said everything we need to make the rapture amen he's enabling us amen he's turning it on in the right season now spiritually we could say well why didn't these revelations you know why didn't we see it uh why well there's always a time and a season according to the word and uh god is enabling amen and we have to be able to grasp the basic principles right the word says that we move from the milk amen we don't instantly go from milk to meat right along the way mom starts throwing carrots in the blender and whatever else and we move from milk to carrots to peas to mashed potatoes to whatever and then one day praise the lord praise the lord we grow up to eat meat amen and nothing against vegetarians they just don't know what they're missing amen so anyway um yes so let's remember each and every one in prayer today and and you know many needs in the body of believers around the world many things uh uh happening you know in south america they're they're just right now going through the rampages of this virus uh many of the believers um uh and south america their jobs are not necessarily lost it's just not happening you can show up to work but if the boss says hey we're not selling nothing i can't pay you then it's the same as being unemployed so we just lift up the bride around the world amen and around the world includes the next county over the next state over et cetera amen next street over amen let's just stand as we go into the word today amen now i want today and i just want you to understand i believe very strongly that we have to uh come and deal as ministry we have to make you aware of how spirits and how they are and the foundation that they have and saints i maybe i have a little complex on this because people think i'm just battering something to death but if we don't if we are not aware if we are not aware and walk blindly into it god will protect us but it doesn't mean you won't get beat up along the way but by god's grace if we can be aware of the two spirits this is the prophet speaking the two spirits in the framework of the church so if you're aware of that already then you won't be blindsided because you won't go around now i'm not advocating we go around all nervous oh what if i'm going to be deceived what if i'm going to be deceived no the holy ghost in you will discern the spirits but the way god designed us amen he enlightens us to recognize the spirit amen so god will put a hedge around us just like he had around job but what if god no wait it's not what if god has enough confidence in you to open the hedge and say go ahead satan no wait god loves me he's going to keep the hedge closed not me no sir he's got so much confidence in you that he's going to say let the trials of life come let the discouragements let all of this come they'll stand you know i don't mean to focus this concerning myself but i just the lord brought this back to me this morning had a little tear sitting in my office there was a time in my life that uh it was god moving me right and sometimes god has to use pressure to move us amen uh uh and i i can tell you in the natural life sometimes it takes exceeding pressure to make things move but i remember one time i was antelope hunting a friend of mine just sent me a picture of a beautiful antelope he just just harvested and uh he wanted me to see that and it reminded me took me back to a time when i was just struggling with whether the lord loved me or not and whether i was was even good enough to be a christian and i went antelope hunting over in the pacimilroy region uh by chalice and and uh this friend of mine had said hey i know where this huge antelope is and uh have permission to hunt on the property the morning we were supposed to go he says no i've decided i'm not going so it was this great blow to me and i i just was just struck i was like wow all this preparation and another young man that was there in the camp said hey i'll go with you paul and so we're driving down and we chose this little two track that went up into the mountain and we see this antelope and he's the one that's hanging in my my mud room right now and i thought oh i'm gonna do this and so i got out of the truck and i crawled and i crawled and i crawled and and then i got in this area that was desert cactus if you know what that is it's real fan grows on the ground if you're not paying attention you don't even realize it's got thousands of little quills and i got my forearms my chest was just poked full of holes and i took a shot at this antelope and i missed what i didn't account for was the fact that i was laying in a draw and the wind was blowing where the envelope was and my bullet hit four feet low and four feet in front of it and it turned and it ran out of sight now you say bill paul this is just carnal is it you see i put my head down and started crying and i said lord why is everything in my life going backwards well i can tell you right now why it was because i wasn't serving him he called me i wasn't doing my part you might say i put my head down and tears filled my eyes and i was like lord why now saints this might seem strange to you but i said lord if you just you just let me shoot that antelope i'd serve you sounds pretty phony doesn't it give me the antelope lord and i'll be a good christian but you see sometimes it resonates much deeper down in the heart i needed a sign you might say of god's favor at that moment in my life i needed something tangible that god heard my prayer you know that antelope ran just when i say ran out of sight that wasn't totally accurate he ran probably 150 yards did a u-turn ran right back stopped within 10 feet of where he was standing before and something in my brain says you know the wind's blowing you hit four feet in front of him and four feet low and i took my cross hairs and i put it four feet back and four feet up and pulled the trigger got me an antelope do you know god did not fail to remind me of my promise thank you lord sometimes we need to make a commitment sometimes some of us need to just get a hand or a heart up and say lord i'm making this vow to you i'm i'm making a commitment to you lord amen hallelujah well i got so many things but i'd just like you to repeat with me today my prayer makes a difference because i want that to come from your lips if you would today my prayers make a difference amen hallelujah we closed out last sunday on speaking about the white dog and black dog and i'd like to just turn into exodus the 20th chapter today once again we're still speaking on my little graph we haven't got away from that uh but there's just a lot that goes with each one of these things and we we have to deal my brother and sister we have on both sides you know sold out but you know it's in the middle ground is where the real warfare is at and even when you're sold out you know uh you know oftentimes saints the gospel is convincing enough but there has to be something deep you wonder i was asking the lord lord give me a tangible example of of the carnal with the spiritual bend and you know as paul was there in rome and he's speaking he said paul what was his name there the the ruler that paul was speaking to he tells him he says you've almost convinced me you know what i'm talking about it just my mind is just slipped on that you've almost convinced me see he was carnal man with a spiritual vein and it was right there so close you almost convinced me and on the other side saying sons and daughters of god can go through a valley so deep and so dark and so rough and that will come to a place that we literally could say the devil almost convinced us to quit but you see on those two sides there's not the issue amen now let's just look at this right here exodus the 20th chapter starting with verse 1 and god spake all these words saying i am the lord thy god which have brought thee out of the land of egypt out of the house of bondage thou shall have no other gods before me now shall not make unto thee any graven image or any likeness of anything that is in heaven above or that is in the earth beneath or that is in the water under the earth thou shall not bow down thyself to them nor serve them for i the lord thy god am a jealous god visiting the iniquity of the fathers upon the children and to the third and fourth generation of them that hate me see we got to make sure we catch the quantifier there of them that hate me this does not apply to the bride of christ does not apply apply to those that are in love with jesus amen verse 6 and showing mercy unto thousands of them that love me and keep my commandments heavenly father we thank you for this day lord for your grace and your mercy ask for your guiding hand lord once again we bind every spirit of sickness lord that would be upon the saints in this body of believers lord we rebuke that we refuse to accept that box of rattlesnakes lord and we send it right back to the pits of hell where it come from lord there be those that have work in different situations father that have kept them from the house of god today we would ask lord that you would just touch them my own sister father with her uncertainty of her job situation just ask lord that you would just come be merciful to her lord merciful to the body of believers the bride of christ we pray in the name of jesus christ amen you may be seated saints now as we're going to be here today like i said i just want to bring clarity we're actually going to do and i felt led to do this saints that it would just be clear why brother paul has uh such a a uh resistance to those false unities that would be brought into uh the body of believers you know that we we all need to love each other uh we got to do this this is a sign of our our love or our unity that we're christians because we do this and i believe those things will come to pass because they are the word of god and therefore they must come to pass but i just feel led of god to bring you through this little a passage that brings you around and shows you how that these spirits would come and the spirits of the ages would come and these spirits as the prophet of god would be in these services and he calls out a woman with cancer and then he calls out another one across the auditorium and he was able to recognize that because this spirit here which the holy ghost pointed out or called out that spirit that was on that individual the spirit of cancer was then crying out to other spirits for help amen and so they exposed both of them amen in their in their in their realm there and so as we look in the day that we're living in these spirits would like to come they like to to gang up as it were right and and uh because they know that they are no match uh for the presence of god amen when the holy spirit is present there the word describes that as a fire amen and it is not just a common fire but it is the most powerful fire there is a cleansing fire amen and so as you look at this you realize that as god is is working in the church in this day he said that he would expose my brother and sister everything that would be a hindrance or everything that would keep you from making a rapture now many times people they don't like that exposure they don't like you know the spirits being pointed out many times people if they feel they are right and i will not exclude myself from that we can become very very resistant to to a correction or being brought to us uh just in the natural things sometimes you know we we will be wrong come on saints you know i'm telling you the truth this morning we can be wrong and it just hurts us to admit it it hurts us i'm not talking about we're just like oh but i'm talking about hurts us it's all we can do to acknowledge that we are wrong amen it might be just as simple as some little natural carnal thing that doesn't matter amen but you know that is just like no i know i saw that on google the other day you're wrong and well maybe not everything on the internet is true my anyway you know you look at this but god working in such a way that he promised to you and i my brother and sister that the word being manifested or christ's coming and manifesting himself in you and i now when christ moves in the house hallelujah when christ moves in the house something else has to be moved out right he's not going to live in the clutter of laodicea amen so when he moves in he starts house cleaning and we might as well come on saints we're predestinated called of almighty god to serve him we might as well open the doors open the windows and start just chucking out everything he doesn't want in the house amen don't hide something in the crawl space or hide something in the attic amen just open the doors and the windows start chucking it out amen just let him move in amen let him claim it is his hey now i want to go right here into john the 14th chapter uh and just lay out just a little foundation of where we're going today philip saith unto him lord show us the father and it i never pronounce this word right suffices us yeah anyway something like that jesus saith in them have i been so long time with you grace tabernacle and yet hath thou not known me philip he that hath seen me hath seen the father how saith thou then show us the father believeth thou not that i am in the father and the father in me the words that i speak unto you i speak not of myself but the father that dwelleth in me he doeth the works amen believe me that i am in the father and the father in me or else believe me for the very work's sake so if you can't recognize it in the scripture then look at the life that the word is producing my brother and sister i'm telling you even today if we set aside our bible set aside our message books all we'd have to do if we just really cared amen would be to look at the life that is being produced what does the life point to amen and you could you could ship a lot of light on a lot of spirits by just simply looking at what they're trying to direct you to oh my i'm telling you my brother and sister i don't know you know the bride of christ said you know uh brother ram said the bride of christ wouldn't be shut down amen should go up hallelujah but there's going to come a time there'll be pressure amen we felt some pressure we felt just a little bit of pressure these last months you know with churches being shut down and issues and things happening and believers getting sick and some believers dying and where a lot of people are like all shook up i thought i thought this couldn't touch us the prophet of god said it couldn't touch us well let me just give you however you want to divide it up and you take the year the month the day the time and if god already ordained to call brother so-and-so home it doesn't matter if there's earthquakes or fires or there's this pandemic or whatever it is when god calls us home they can't keep us here amen so people are like well i thought believers couldn't get these kind of things that the holy spirit would keep them from it i'm sorry my brother and sister but god already had ordained on that day at that time that brother that sister would be promoted to glory don't get trying to connect this here on this carnal side of earth to the great plan of god oh this brother this sister had got covered and they went away my brother and sister if it hadn't been coveted it might have been the heart disease that they had or the lung issue they had or the kidney problem they had god knows amen as the brother donny has said before it don't do much good to ask god to bless your cheetos before you eat them cheetos or cheetos hallelujah lord turn these cheetos into good food come on saints amen so in our season when our time has come it's come but people get to the place that they they question well is the plan of god really working yes it is it's working perfectly amen no nuclear watch no swiss watch nothing keeps better time than the time of the plan of god amen oh hallelujah amen verily verily i say unto you he that believeth on me the works that i do shall he do also so this my brother and sister john 14 12 could be used as a stereotypical defining moment of who the true believer is or not you see many believe if god sent a prophet and they acknowledge that but that's not what my bible says that's right he that believeth on me the works that i do shall he do also greater works than these shall he do because i go unto my father and whatsoever ye shall ask in my name that will i do that the father may be glorified in the son and if you shall ask anything in my name i will do it well hallelujah i think i need a big house in miami beach with a pool and a a rolls royce i can take you right to a story that i read where this couple read this scripture talk to their pastor got prayed for started confessing asking anything in god's name they said they prayed three four five six times a day for god to give them a mansion in miami beach and a rolls royce and there they were standing in front of their house in front of their rolls the scripture works but you see god could give that to the bride of christ saints and the reason you're not living in miami beach and driving a rolls royce is because the bride of christ would never abuse the word of god but god will honor his promise so you say well i wasn't god at all well it very well could have been my brother and sister because god will honor he will honor faith and those people believe they ask anything in god's name he would give it to them but i tell you what you and i want we don't want a rolls royce we don't want to live in miami beach we want the holy ghost we want the presence of almighty god we want to come and live in his presence now that's what changes us it's not a carnal possession of this life that motivates the bride of christ but it's him the bridegroom to be able to stand and say you know what i am the bride of jesus christ i am mrs jesus christ that's what stirs the heart of the true believer amen not what we have tangible things out here one of these days when a tidal tsunami storm or something hits miami beach their mansion will get destroyed and their car crushed and washed away my brother and sister it all of that stuff my brother and sister but the word shows us that what we're asking for is incorruptible oh hallelujah aren't you glad no care of this life no saying no circumstance of this life you know it won't change that amen hallelujah now here's kind of a scripture i want to get to right here verse 15. if you love me see now we're coming down to the qualifier who the believer is right if you love me keep my commandments amen oh because this is to those who love him right amen so if you love him you keep his commandments now remember i want to put this out make it very clear that jesus said he did not come to do away with the law but he come to magnify it amen so people are like no no that's the old covenant old testament old covenant that doesn't apply to us no i'm sorry it does apply jesus christ himself said i didn't get rid of it i come to magnify it now my brother and sister you and i both know that in a flesh we cannot live a life that you would say would be legal according to the mosaic law but the revelation of the love and grace of almighty god becomes revelation to us to realize that word right there is a road map but just like gps if you come and you make a little detour it tells you oh okay rerouting and it'll take you down and take you here and bring you right back on the same route again because you can't get there straight as a gate narrow is the way right we ought to say thank you lord otherwise it'd just be a lot of sloppy christians show up at heaven and here you are doing your best to live the word of god and all these sloppy christians get in wow you're not going to be happy about that why i could have lived sloppy no you weren't called to be sloppy you were called according to the word amen and that's what motivates you that's what moves you a lot of sloppy christians out there but we're not called to be sloppy christians hallelujah amen and i will pray the father and he shall give you another comforter which we know is the holy ghost then he may abide with you forever even the spirit of truth okay now we can start making these connections this spirit of truth my brother and sister is in the holy ghost so someone cannot have the holy ghost and live with the spirit of air amen they can't say well i've got the holy ghost just like you no no you see the holy ghost is the spirit of truth whom the world cannot receive because it seeth him not now is that seeing him as a spirit the holy ghost no we the holy ghost my brother and sister you professing that you have the holy ghost is christ in you identifying you with the word amen that's what where you can stand and say i believe i have the holy ghost hey man sister jerry shared a quote with me the other day real beautiful brother brown says now don't you go around saying you got the holy ghost it's the holy ghost has got you hallelujah so it's not for us to boast i've got the holy ghost no it's to come to that position that god identifies i've got you oh hallelujah i want to have that amen in his heart arms i feel protected amen not our arms around him his arms around us can you say amen to that hallelujah amen but ye know him for he dwelleth with you and shall be in you i will not leave you without the holy ghost amen i will not leave you comfortless i will come to you yet a little while and the world seeth me no more but ye see me because i live ye shall live also at that day you shall know that i am in my father and ye and me and i in you he that hath my commandments and keepeth them he it is that loveth me and he that loveth me shall be loved of my father and i will love him and will manifest myself to him you see we can't come to the place and say we have god without manifesting the nature the life the attributes of god they have to come out they will come out right now brother brown talks about how you know that if he had the spirit of john dillinger amen he wouldn't be an artist right and if you have the spirit of who did to use the artist michelangelo and then michelangelo as far as we know didn't take a machine gun in rob banks right so the very nature when god manifests himself to him meaning you and i then when that's manifested it's going to bring forth that nature of god it can't bring forth a cuckober my brother and sister it's got to bring forth a grain of wheat amen so beautiful as we look at those things now as we do this i want to just uh go forward and here in this point tying together manifest himself myself to him now remember we're talking about the white dog and the black dog and i i'm reiterating just a little bit from this last sunday but you see the chief my brother and sister was in a great battle right it was which dog he fed the most that was what one dominated as it were in his world now we uh know that when it comes down there really isn't regardless of the fact that there is a make believer uh in reality the make believer is an unbeliever right because he doesn't have the genuine if he had the genuine he would be a believer right just so what brother branham said about the devil uh you know said if he come in under the blood he would be your brother right so he can't get under the blood without the effect of the blood taking place even upon satan so you look at that and realize now that these two spirits in the framework of the church right and i i guess i kind of skipped over my title today the two vines bring two results amen and so as you look at this and realize that that that uh those vines cannot bring forth the exact same result uh uh they they have to bring forth uh different and uh so you and i i'll just be blunt today i hope i'm not too blunt for anybody's taste but my brother and sister as we move forward in time and god has always tested with time you can't go forward feeding equal portions there'll come a time that you will have to feed the white dog more or the black dog more and we speak of it as though it is our decision because god has granted to us free moral agency predestination is not i'm going to throw a lasso on you and drag you into heaven predestination was god acknowledging he saw what decision you would make amen so we can't go forward feeding these equal portions right straddling the fence as it were living in the world trying to live for god uh you know in those framework uh but we can make some emphatic statements and i'll just make this one brief this world and its attractions can never lead you to god i don't care if you're talking religious spirits i don't care what kind of issues that you are talking or how good it sounds or how good it looks or how it feels to you the world and its attractions can never lead you to god amen the world of sin though i made this statement to you last sunday i want to just touch on it again the world of sin will magnify the grace of god to you when you see just how vile and wicked this world is and you see what god is doing in your life acknowledging maybe this morning it would be good if we lift our hand and acknowledge and say i know god called me hey i know that i am a child of god amen not a question in my mind in my heart or soul of who i am and so the very wickedness of sin in this world should magnify the grace of god to you and i to know that we would be that if it was not for his grace and i say thank you this morning lord for your grace and your mercy amen hallelujah people go oh well you're predestinated to be the bride remember now my brother and sister as the prophet explains predestination to us that's not god forcing you that's god acknowledging who you are hallelujah because if it was god forcing then it would just be like russian roulette okay we're in church [Music] fourth person in the fifth row one two three four five one two three four sorry about the rest of you it's not how it works god recorded in the lamb's book of life because he knew the seed that was in you would produce the life of christ hallelujah otherwise we would be called puppets a lot of ways we can go from there i have to leave that one alone amen now look the prophet of god told us several different places in different ways but it all comes out the same that the holy spirit cannot and will not lead you away from the word so when you hear people saints i'm speaking pretty plain forgive me but this is my job is to make a real plain to you that you recognize these things so when people would say now the lord told me to go do this and it's contrary to the word that was not the holy spirit there is no way no matter fancy words you do it or how many times it's repeated it will not change the fact that the holy spirit will not lead us away from the word oh my but i'll tell you what maybe the side we should be looking at not negative we should be looking at the positive church young people old people everybody in between amen when god starts to move in your life don't back away when the holy spirit comes down starts to touch you don't back away amen don't get afraid and say well i've never felt that presence i remember many years ago dealing with a young person and god come down right in the service start dealing with them and you could just see like the deer in the headlights look this young person was just scared to death shaking like a leaf almost got up and walked out or ran out of the church but stayed and then later they said you know brother paul i i didn't know what what was happening i didn't understand and you know my brother and sister the holy spirit had come down that young person was not uh they were not familiar with the moving of the holy spirit and you know they got nervous amen they started to shy away from that because they didn't understand what was happening and if satan can get us to the place that we move away when the presence of god comes and we shy away from it we get all nervous we got to go to the restroom we got to go here we got to go to there we got to do whatever or we take our mind somewhere else my brother and sister that's what satan wants to do that nervous spirit is not of god god brings peace we sang of it this morning he wants us just to not shy away he wants us to just settle down god you know convince yourself god's got our best interest in mind hallelujah oh my brother and sister reminds me of a sermon that brother chris preached here several years ago about the bush pilot amen you know you'd be thinking okay we're flying down a canyon and the fog has settled in and we can't see where we're going you know it wouldn't it makes sense to to to fly up higher higher and higher but look the cares of life and the struggle that we're in we can't fly high enough on this earth to get out of that you can't fly over your problems but by leadership amen by having a familiar understanding of where you're at and the path that you're walking as brother chris shared that story and that bush pilot he just knew and he could fly up that valley because he knew where he was at and he had experienced that before and he was able to safely fly that my brother and sister he could as brother chris shared that story he couldn't turn around in the canyon it was too small so we got nowhere to turn around and go back to we got well this is just too hard i'm going to go back to where i was and maybe another day in my life i'll try this again no what you got to do is get in the word let the holy spirit come down he said i will lead you and i will guide you what you got to do is trust him you're going to just stop and say okay i'm living in laodicea it's the narrowest darkest canyon i've ever been in my life it's a wicked place but he said he'd lead me and i'm just going to let him lead me hallelujah but people get nervous they start to shy away from that i just want to say a word to the parents this morning i just felt led this morning once again just to do this and you create an atmosphere you create a place where your children know the presence of god don't leave them to find out when they're 25 or 35 or 40 years old who god is amen show them bring an atmosphere in the home atmosphere bring the atmosphere to church that your children would know the presence of god young people growing up in this message and they say well i grew up in the church and i never ever felt the presence of god oh i can tell you my brother and sister they either grew up in a really messed up church or no one ever made them aware of the moving of the spirit of god a lot of conflicting emotions as preachers brother david brother chris will testify of this you're going to see the conflicting emotions you're going to see the reactions of people sometimes you can see them but they just burst out now i want that i want you lord sometimes they draw back into their shell sometimes they look around like i don't understand my brother and sister it's our job as a ministry as parents to create the atmosphere that our children know god is real because if we won't do it the world will handily show them there's no such thing as a god and whatever you want to do to make you feel good is fair game oh hallelujah come on i hope i'm not too blunt to you but it's our job amen it's our job to promote the word promote praise promote worse my brother and sister i'm telling you there's nothing stirs my heart more than to see young people worship the lord when they start to grasp that to realize i you know i don't got to be you know 25 years old and have children and a job and and just really no you can be 10 years old and know that presence of god know he's real and be here to acknowledge it and say lord i know you're real i'll lift my hands i'll lift my voice oh but my brother and sister i'm sorry if this peels a hide off of you but it was sitting church and we won't sing we won't worship we won't lift a hand we won't do nothing what kind of signal are we sending to to our family to not besides what we're sending to god i mark my attendance card today well i'll tell you what i'd rather mark a praise card as it were than an attendance card i'd rather that god would hear amen and my prayers and my worship would come as a sweet savor before the throne of almighty god that he'd go my son and my daughter they're worshiping today that's just not a church thing if you save it for church you sure missed out amen hallelujah proverbs 22 6 says train up a child want to ask us parents i know my shortcomings by the grace of god my daughters serve the lord i've got a son that acted too much like his dad he's not serving god i remind him son are you going to do just what i did and go all this way and then look back and say man i sure wished i done something different come on let's train up our children let's break through the barrier these these uh these complexes these things that we're like well bro paul i'm not vocal well hallelujah i don't know what side of heaven you're going to hang out in i honestly i i don't mean to sound facetious but i don't think there there's any going to be any signs in heaven quiet on but you see what happens is this process is all bringing about a separation now we're actually going to get in our sermon that my time's all burnt up hallelujah we'll just roar right through this by god's grace so you look at this now we understand that abraham and lot were having trouble they would have a water hole they'd fight over whose sheep got to drink in the water hole and the land to graze it all of these different things now you have to understand the world agriculture just because you're a son or daughter of god doesn't mean it rains where you want it to rain and when it rains where you want it to rain amen so you know you're still we're still subject to the things of this life amen now god's given us power over those things and we have seen prayer stop rain amen we've seen a prophet of god stand on a mountain we make emphasis that on a mountain and rebuke a storm and and the whole world bracing for several feet of snow and a few flurries and the clouds blew across and then sunshine come out so you look at this now my brother and sister so in genesis 13 9 it says not the whole land before thee separate thy cell you see god wants separators not mixers amen i pray thee from me if thou will take the left hand then i will go to the right or if thou depart to the right hand then i'll go to the left and loft lifted up his eyes and beheld the plane of jordan that was well watered man this is a place to grow vegetables and all kinds of stuff man what a place to have a farm well watered everywhere before the lord destroyed sodom and gomorrah even as the garden of the lord like the land of egypt as thou comest into zaur then lot chose him all the plane of jordan and lot journeyed east and they separated themselves one from the other abram dwelled in the land of canaan lot dwelt in the cities of the plain and pitched his tent towards sodom so now of all this 360. come on saints this is what i was talking about you can kind of watch you you don't have to do all this sometimes you can just watch of all the 360 that lot had to pitch his tent he pitched it towards sodom i want you to think about it in your own life we have got the free moral agency to choose 360. pitch it towards anything you want to pitch it towards hallelujah lot had to pitch it towards sodom but the men of sodom were wicked my goodness i want to just move down there a bunch of months of heathens i want to just move into an environment you know where god's not even present we don't see nothing happening and i'm just going to go down there they were wicked and sinners before the lord exceeding the lord said unto abram after that lot was separated from him you'll not find my brother and sister till later in scripture god's speaking to lot at all i want you to see this i want you to think about this you want to get to the place hey i'm not bothered by having to pray i'm not bothered by reading my bible how good is that well if you like that or don't like that however you want to look at that no big deal you can pitch your tent towards sodom and never read a bible ever again in your life hmm am i being too rough he tells abram now after lots out of his life see there was this negative element but if we go back in scripture you'll find that god had told abram in the very beginning to separate yourself so he come for a season and god said no if i'm going to bless you buddy you're going to have to get a total separation from unbelief amen after the law what's up lift up thine eyes amen yes that's right all i have is woe woe here woe there whoa whoa whoa no abram lift up thine eyes and look from the place where thou art northward i have a pretty good built-in compass if you had one right now you would realize i'm pointing north i'm blessed of god i don't know how it works it works [Music] northward southward eastward westward amen that covers everything in our life we're back to 360. right but of a different 360 now lots 360 zeroed him down into a place where people were sinners and wicked before god but god's now got abram up here on the plane and tells him i want you to look 360 because i've gave this to you you know what it was symbolically speaking an entirely different land not even the same land oh hallelujah aren't you glad there's a land beyond the river oh hallelujah that they call the sweet forever and we only get there by love's decree what is that love right here we get there by the decree of god in written form oh hallelujah gets me excited saints i hope i hope it stirs your heart also for all the land which i'll see us to thee will i give it unto thy seed forever amen so what a what an incredible promise amen that was given and this all come out of a separation amen that abram come to the place the moved of the holy spirit amen because as we read earlier that it would be god manifest in us and it come to the place that the separation was more important to abram than the fellowship with his nephew law amen so he's able to separate and he moves and so the attraction my brother and sister comes that there is a time and a place and you know it wasn't scot-free we see abram going off and he ends up in places uh abimelech you know looks at his wife his old old wore out wife hallelujah i don't know what was wrong with abimelech a man in the prime of his life with the kingdom and he's out there and he's got spies out looking at all the old women come on have a little sense of humor here he said look out spies looking at all these old women no my brother and sister you know what's happening that word that's changing you and i into who we really are had been working on sarah and abraham eyes had actually been blinded to that he didn't realize he was really looking at the very manifestation of the gift he hadn't caught the full value of the revelation and people say well now brother paul is the ministry fivefold ministry are these people gonna have more revelation than the prophet no my brother and sister whoever thought that has got an inflated sense of their value but i'm telling you there was revelation that was brought and revealed in our day that we still have not caught it it's still not has it been manifested to us it's not been enabled and that's why the word is not dead to us we're not looking back to an old message it's alive every day and uh more every day more every day more every day because you see it's coming alive just as it was as cyril was walking sarah was living she was changing from that old woman back to a beautiful woman so much that a king looked at her and abram lies and says whoa oh no no no she's my sister and uh bimalik wasn't like i need an old lady around my house come on i don't mean to sound carnal but he wasn't looking for an old lady he looked down there at her and said that is the most beautiful woman and i have ever and here's another side note just for history you'll understand that abimelech god set this up abimelech's household was barren so of all the wives that he had he had not one heir he had not one legacy in his household he looked down at sarah no doubt he thought oh there's a beautiful young woman maybe you know i i want to marry her for what she is but maybe she could produce me an heir she could bring forth and we see what happened and you know bim looks like lord you know i'm righteous i'm holy lord you know i never do this and he says you go ask him to pray for you or i'll put a curse on you oh so he goes down and the very man who lied to him now prays for him so what my point is is is uh well let me finish that thought lately my wife not blaming her but she's like you didn't finish the story sorry um but uh he prays for him and the curse comes from abimelech's and his wives start to have babies see god had it all set up all had to come right in the right place but abimelech said lord you know my heart remember we were talking the other day see it all comes back and not ability he knows the heart hallelujah okay i'm getting sidetracked anyway so you see this is where he comes and he lays this all out and we see how that god is moving now i want to jump down here to genesis 19 because now we have another side this is this is abram up here on this land he owns this land god's working with him god's blessing him gives him a child brings forth a promised seed and now here in revelation genesis 19 we see now that two angels now my brother and sister people have through the ages they've looked at this now my brother and sister i i look at that and when i read what the prophet of god said it just all comes together you can hear the click so loud as it falls in place that it's unreal come two angels to sodom at even and lot set in the gate of sodom lot seeing them rose up to meet them and he bound himself with his face toward the ground and he said behold now my lords small ill attorney and i pray you into your servant's house and terry all night wash your feet you shall rise up early and go on your ways and they said nay but we will abide in the street all night oh we won't go into all the symbolism you might say that's in the word here the typology but my brother and sister it was there you see the word is not going to be hid the word is there it's powerful it's mighty it's two edges it can abide wherever god sends it amen it can do what god sends it to do but there is something uh uh moving here and so there's a little something stirring in lot and so they're gonna stay in the street all night but he pressed upon them greatly so there was a there was still a degree of good you see lot had become you might say the mayor of the city sat in the gate that's where they that they set to judge that was what are they set to do and so what has he done he did not even attend outside the city any longer he's right downtown he's a part of the government he's a part of the program amen he presses on them they turn in entered into his house and he made them a feast and did bake unleavened bread and they did eat but before they lay down the men of the city even the men of sodom can pass the house around both old and young all the people from every come on saints every quarter that means the guy that was a deacon down here the guy that was the preacher the guy that was this the guy that was that this is the kind of church that sodom had produced or the kind of church that produced sodom come on prophet of god said it was weak pulpits lord help us amen amen not asking for special favor but would certainly ask for your prayers we don't want a weak pulpit we want every spiritual vitamin this word of god has got for us amen so these people come and they called into lot said unto him where are the men that come in to see thee this night bring them out to us that we may know them now you know we got mixed company here this morning but my brother and sister they weren't wanting to just say hi my name's fred no this is sodom this is a perverse and wicked generation of amen and they had their own intent oh my you know what from every quarter come on these weren't back alley people that were demanding this perversion now you look i'll just side note you for a moment if you want to do the research you'll find it you go look at the denominations now that are giving in to alternative ideology in their pulpits which is a politically correct way to say and you know what i'm saying maybe we're in sodom it could possibly be that sodom has showed up even in conservative idaho wow oh it couldn't be in idaho the idaho i grew up in if your kid was wandering down the street somebody might stop not to snatch your kid but somebody to say does your mama know you're here it's no longer that kind of place reminds me a little story told the boy riding a bicycle down the highway in wyoming and these two very strange looking men stopped and said oh son get in the car with us we can take you wherever and the little boy said well my daddy said if you lay a hand on me he'll shoot you and they're like where's your daddy i don't know but he's watching you right now they got back in their car and drove off now my brother and sister god would give us some saints would say you know what you lay your hand on me devil my daddy is going to shoot you hallelujah there's more to that little story or whatever because the story goes on the little boys in town and walking down the sidewalk with his daddy and the little boy out loud and funny daddy them the men that wanted me to get in the car and go with them i told them if they laid a hand on me i'd shoot them and the man looks over there and goes are you sure that's them son and he goes yeah he goes did they lay a hand on you no daddy good because i left my gun in the truck now my brother and sister i serve a god that knows how to take care of his children amen so here we are so the men they come in there they said again they come in he needs to be a judge now how he deal worse with thee than with them so they're threatening lot and they press sore upon the man lot and come near to break the door but the men put forth their hand and pulled lot into the house to them amen here's god always rich in mercy shut the door and they smote the men that were at the door of the house with blindness both small and great so that they wearied themselves to find the door amen now this all ties back saints to the scripture amen that they are blind cannot have ears they cannot hear amen so they've been smote this is actually god's doing this is not an unfortunate event amen and the man said on a lot hast thou any besides son-in-law thy sons that daughters and whatsoever the house and the city bring them out of this place for we will destroy this place because the cry of them is waxing great before the face of the lord and oh did we jump somewhere have i got myself lost okay okay and lot went out before the face of the lord oh oh here's the verse okay excuse me this is this profound and i'm just going to put it out parents forgive me i don't mean it to be a a a cross they said in the lighthouse there are any besides son-in-law and thy daughters and whatsoever the house and the city bring them out uh and so we're looking here this sets a stage now they said we're going to destroy this place because the cry of them is waxed and great before the face of the lord and lord now under the spirit of [Music] compromise he goes look son there's going to be trouble coming and this place is going to get destroyed and you you need to just come with us what did they do they basically were mocked you know why parents want to tie this together to you because the daughter and son-in-law's had never saw a move of god in dad's life so when dad said no god's talking to me we've got to do this they're like what are you talking about what are you what are you talking about that's ridiculous if god was going to be anywhere in the city it would be in our church [Music] you see also in these scriptures here we won't go back and catch that but um lot under the spirit of compromise this is where i got skipped over he says you know what don't bother these men i got two young daughters that have never been touched of a man just take them out and do whatever you want to them i want to i want you to catch how depraved lot went from being with abram and being blessed to the place he's now offered his daughters to the world do whatever you please with them i'm sorry my brother and sister that just doesn't sit right with me that brings me to a place them would be what you might call fighting words amen that would be the place that you call it whatever you want to call it i call it a righteous indication which means i'm going to hurt you amen you're not touching my daughters there won't be life left in my bones before you get your hands on my daughters that lot under that spiritual condition had declined a decision that he made up on the plains of memory right there in a time and a place my brother and sister that he could have come and said you know what nope i'm going to stand with god's despised few uh you know what i'll tell you if abram had went down onto the plains there in sodom they'd had a revival the devil would have drove them people out of there and that would have been a godly place you see because that was what god was going to do he was going to bless abram amen but you see how it was it didn't matter where abram chose or a lot chose he chose up there but if his heart was down there i want you to get this he could have stayed up there on top in the plains and the grasslands but if his heart was down in sodom he'd have brought sodom to the plains amen so here it is that his own family mocks him but when the morning rise the angels hastened lots saying garage take thy wife and my two daughters which are here lest they be consumed in the iniquity of the city now this is god's grace i want you to catch this this is god's grace amen that it is here and while he lingered right he was dragging his feet the men laid hold upon his hand and upon the hand of his wife by the hand of his two daughters and the lord being merciful unto him and brought him forth and set him without the city amen drug him right out of there supernatural event took place and it came to pass that they brought them forth abroad and he said escape for thy life look not behind thee amen i've told you before i'm going to say it again that's why i don't really like to see people give glory to their past right the scripture says look not behind thee neither stay thou in all the plain escape to the mountain lest thou be consumed and lot said unto them oh not so lord now saints i want you to catch this here what was happening god gave very specific instructions through his messengers god is speaking god's given mercy god took him by the hand even and let him out of this place and now his response to all of this is not so my lord behold now thy servant have found grace in thy sight and now has magnified thy mercy uh which thou hast showed unto me in saving my life and i cannot escape to the mountain lest some evil take me and i die now i want to just be here and i might not be able to get this finished because i'm not going to just keep you forever today and we still have quite a bit to go but he has just received a personal invitation from god it doesn't get any better than that it doesn't get any grander or any more magnificent or any more glorified than a personal invitation from god and he says i can't do that because something on the mountain might get me well i tell you the mountain that god was wanting him to go back to would have been come back lot you're straying away come back lot come back lot and we see symbolically uh you find all through the bible amen god is on the mountain amen you'll find there my brother and sister the personal invitation to come to the mountain because great things happen on the mountain you think about that god revealing uh to moses took place on the mountain uh gideon was up on the side of the mountain the very rock that he was hiding behind with his little uh thrashing and his little wine press and all of that that very rock turned out to be jesus christ amen that rock was alive amen it was there all the time abraham god's provided ram didn't take place in a valley somewhere took place on a mountain and god himself threw them in it was god speaking amen he says i got a provided place for you lot come on to the mountain and i'll say this if god invites you god can keep you hallelujah you don't worry about what happened well if i get all this and i get all that you know if i if i go to serve god well no god invites you he'll keep you amen see now what's the loss alternative give me another city verse 20. give me another city it's just a little city can't be too much sin in a little city right you obviously didn't grow up in the country come in the most wicked little cities little wicked places i should say are these little towns and i won't even go into that because i don't want to scorch your eyebrows you guys will go out to eat and everybody like us smell burnt hair but these little towns my brother and sister might only have 750 people they might have 10 churches and 750 people and they'll have 20 bars do the math some cases i knew once upon a time deacon in the church owned the bar that doesn't become any more of a paradox than anything you can find see we can settle for our own zeor we can settle my brother and sister as this goes on and god grants him gives mercy to him sends him out there and lets him go to zayor but you see zeor was too wicked and lot had learned a little bit of a lesson and so here is the mountain still the mountain didn't go away saints and so here's the mountain and now lot starts to work his way back up the mountain because he liked going to church he liked to having this he liked blessing his food he liked saying little blessings over makes it halfway up the mountain now i don't want to dwell on this either but i want to drive it home enough it's real to you he gets up on the side of the mountain he finds a cave amen a hole not a place to glorify god not a place to lift up the cross amen so he moves up there moves into this cave but when he never got rid of saints and this is the thing and i just need to close probably but this is the thing i want to drive home to you the spirit that was in sodom never got delivered from lot his wife couldn't help herself she was thinking i used to have a nice house i had all of this i have my social thing i have my i i'm the church you know fellowship coordinator i'm the i'm like this and she had to look back to that and poof it was over with now i want to paraphrase it or type it to you in a slightly different way you know she turned into a pillar of salt they believe they've identified what that pillar is amen they say well if it was a pillar of salt it would have washed away by now but my brother and sister they say that is one of the hardest pillars of salt that was ever there and time is wearing it away but very slowly but i'm telling you what let me bring it to you in different deal she was walking along and we've seen this happen she was walking along and she thought i used to this and i used to that i remember i remember remember the prophet of god talking about that little girl stopped outside the door of the dance hall amen and what happened she started looking and in this modern day lot's wife starts looking back you know i i enjoyed going to a church that my cleavage could show i enjoyed going to a church my clothes could be true and i could walk on my heels and prance as it was i'm sorry i'm not picking on your sisters i'm just making the example and the where the men could go down amen i knew a guy was a leadership in a denominational church and they had a place i believe they call it the roost and all the ministry of the church is a big church they had like eight or nine ministers in that church had offices and they would all meet at the roost and drink liquor and smoke cigars that's what i want for a pastor come on but they're looking back right so they could be what they wanted to be with their idea of what god wanted and many of them today are lot's wife because they're turning they're turning they're turning and they are going back they're not just looking back they are going back my brother and sister i can tell you right now this sounds harsh and i don't mean it because i believe till it's not over till it's over but i tell you the hearts and souls of sons and daughters of god call out and crave the word now you can get detoured for a season right amen amen gps will turn us back you know rerouting rerouting so i'm saying they're all lost don't misunderstand me but that spirit is what i'm talking about it's there look back look look look look don't look look forward look to the mountain in fact forget that go to the mountain amen so here look what's happening here so they go and they escape and they end up down there in zeor and it's too wicked right they move on hallelujah you see we can settle for that we can settle for a cave halfway up the mountain but i'll tell you what happens that spirit was there now i don't want you to take this in natural because in the natural it's kind of just creepy but you look at this now here's lot and the two daughters typing church amen and they're like god's not in control we're not ever going to have any seed be able to take the seed of our father forward and we look around as though the only man left on earth was their own father but the church said you know what just give us your name and we can take care of it we'll produce what we think god wants the church to be we'll produce the kind of believer we think it ought to be because i'm telling you what kind of anointing saints what kind of anointing caused a daughter to look at their daddy and say i want to sleep with my daddy and you say man that was a horrible decision you know it wasn't even a decision that was made there it was made back when lot was up here and given the opportunity to take anything he wanted and he pitched his tent towards otto the stage right in his family father might sound a little harsh forgive me but you will set the stage for what happens to your daughters and your sons well they got to believe for themselves that's right but if they see god moving inside the four walls of your life or your home and they'll be more apt to say you know what god is real and i want to serve a god like that because my prayers make a difference now i know this is a little blunt forgive me amen but it has to be dealt with oh my what anointing told them there'd be no seed where did they come to conclusion they'd be no seed didn't come from god what anointing told them that their natural act would bring forth a prophesied word come on their natural act they did something carnal something that's just totally against nature and believed that that would bring forth the prophesied word i'm telling you it's happening today saints people are doing things that are just totally against the word of god believing that's going to bring about the prophesied results amen but look at this now my can i have just a few more minutes you see in the beginning not complete beginning but in the beginning lot and his seed were an affliction deborah and his seed i'm just going to use the word abraham because that's really who he was so lot seed was an affliction to abraham's seed then came a separation come on go study your church age book came a separation and it went for a long time the separation went for a long time but in the end it would come so close it would deceive the very leg it can't stay separated it's got to come back together it's got to come back and once again in that it would come and it would bring a place that people were going to once again have to exercise free moral agency and the seed of god has the holy ghost to guide them and they cannot be deceived that is the word of god that's a prophet's word they can't be deceived amen and so look at this now the daughters their act they bring forth moab and ammon and both of those became an affliction in the side of israel and this was conceived oh hallelujah i hope you catch this this was not conceived on the mountain under the anointing of almighty god the holy ghost and it was not conceived down here in other cities they or in complete sin against god it was in the middle ground saints it was halfway from where the holy ghost ruled to where carnality and satan ruled it was halfway in the middle is where the cave was that brought forth the seed of moab oh hallelujah i hope you see that amen it's not just wickedness out here i can deal with wickedness i've got friends that they come up and they start to talk and they're like sorry paul i'll i won't use those words and they manage to have a whole conversation but their normal everyday life is you know like the cartoon is the blue streak just a blue streak i can deal with them [Music] but it's the one that said hmm well symbolically we won't need that part that's the ones that make me nervous i can deal with that wicked guy out here because some of them are so honest they just make you almost hurt how honest they are guys they're like well you know i was doing that deal with you and i realized i shorted you a quarter come on halfway up the mountain that's where the problem lies amen so they become an affliction once again because you see moab and ammon could trace their lineage right back to abraham we're all one i've heard that so many times in the last 10 years it just makes me nervous we're all one no i'm sorry i don't think so i'm sorry i'm sorry let's go here now skip right along here now here we are and that's why i feel like i need to finish just have grace on me if you would saints in israel abode and them and the people had a revival no sir they begin to commit whoredom with who lots family conceived in a cave under a religious spirit that we must fulfill the seed of god we must do it god doesn't have enough of a grip on what the message is going to do in the 21st century we've got to make this happen come on you know what that is that's a domineering female spirit in the church that's when the church says god don't know what he's doing we've got to draw everyone together why don't we just sit back my brother and sister and pray god bring unity into the body of believers bring unity to the bride of christ bring unity to no we're going to make it happen boredom with the daughters of moab literally family and they called the people into the sacrifices of their gods and the people did eat and bowed down to their gods you know what this means oh let me drive this home to you and then after this i'll give this rest saints and we'll find other good things to preach about but i've just got to get this off the chest my brother and sister did you read the words right there they called that means some of them came that's right come on come on oh we're all one and they did eat and then they bowed down now this word eat my brother and sister in this scripture i'm not here to distort it but this word eat taken naturally and spiritually that's right they ate in their feasts natural but they also to bow down to their gods had to be eating what was being preached to them they sat down and it was like oh aren't we all one we're all family we have the same heritage we have we have we have we have and this is this and you know that's not important because this person was with the prophet and the prophet told them this but i'm sorry it's nowhere in the prophet's message nowhere in scripture but people ate it amen amen and what happened israel joined himself unto beopiore amen and god rejoiced no no saints he'll never rejoice in whoredom he rejoice that's why i chose for the opening scripture what i chose have no other gods they forgot it they forgot it that there can't be any other god it's the word and the word alone and i can't tell you depending on how you worded the prophet of god literally speaks i'm gonna probably exaggerate but he speaks in the hundreds of the word is our absolute the word is our ultimate the word is that go back to the word it's the word alone you look it up study it out the prophet of god's doing that you cannot my brother and sister eat the word and eat man's idea they will go together hallelujah because you can't feed both dogs you can't feed the religious spirit and you can't feed the holy ghost from the same trash can i think you could take verse two and preach for about a year on it amen what was their sacrifices let me just inject this real quick they went out killed the cat hung it in the tree and no no no no saints their sacrifices resembled the sacrifice israel was called to offer exactly exactly exactly i want you to catch the significance of this every sacrifice was exactly offered according to the word of the hour why didn't it yield the same result because the spirit behind the sacrifice was not the correct spirit god help us and i'm not judging anybody saints i just want you as a group of believers even our visitors i pray you don't walk out of here shell-shocked your eyebrows burnt off but look it's important we know where we stand because you see it comes so close to deceive the very elective possible but i'm telling you this word won't let it be possible this word won't let deception come and rest in our soul amen because god will come right through there and wash that out of there root that out of there cut that out of there whatever is necessary but you see it was all the same sacrifices and the people boy they gobbled it up i'm telling you don't ever be fooled by a church clear full of people just jumping up and shout and amen and hallelujah don't be fooled by people jumping up and running around the church and people jumping up and speaking in tongues don't be fooled by that nonsense that same guy will steal the tires off your car on monday morning amen none of that means nothing it's a life my brother and sister it's a life hallelujah and so it's there the sacrifice what the people will do and we're all called to bow down the man who won't bow come on i want him go in there today go back to daniel amen everybody's called to bow down it's who you're going to bow down to and they bowed down to their gods not jehovah not lord god almighty not elohim the great i am no they're gods and they can't even put a big g on their gods because they're just a man made created crafted as the scripture says they took the traditions of men and not the word of god hallelujah so they've got a whole process built up that was this was said and this must be done and this is part of that and this is this i want the word i want a pure word i want any one of you if god called you to be able to say look brother paul i was reading in my bible this right here read this oh sister you have no right to handle that no my brother and sister god speaks to sisters she just needs to make sure she isn't trying to be the preacher and and dominate things but god speaks to that that word is alive it needs to be alive not as brother branham says not just some anointed minister why the people just sit there hallelujah that's the kind of god i want to serve that's the kind to do that but look at this see so they bowed themselves to it but not only that whether they realized it or not they joined themselves [Music] now let me throw this at you where's the rest of israel where's the rest of israel not all israel went down there where's the rest of israel they're over here offering an offering on the sacrifice amen they are eating the word amen and they are bowing down to god amen because there was a portion that could not be deceived one of his name was phineas i'll tell you what oh some people they don't like me oh maybe you're beating on this too much brother paul sounds like you're just angry about that no i'm sorry i'm not there's a spirit here and i'm going to just drive that thing away because if he doesn't leave i'm going to be the phineas if i have to be or maybe there'll be some other phineas's and i'm going to go rip through the front door of their tent and i'm going to ram them through the belly and pin them to the ground and stop the curse that's moving through our message not me not me my brother and sister it's god no man will do that but it's time we stand up and say well in the message we gotta all stand together because it's all the denominations against us no sorry some of you are a denomination come on and i don't say that mockingly that probably did come out a little mockingly amen god loved this so much verse four he says to moses you think brother paul's preaching hard god said to moses sorry brother trevor you're close okay so uh brother uh was you down there at those meetings yeah huh and you think some of the preachers in this message are rough come on take all the heads of the people and hang them up before the lord against the sun that the fierce anger of the lord may be turned away from israel there was nothing about this great move of unity that brought something pleasing to the lord well you know we're just a small number in the message the prophet said it'd be even smaller than what it is moses said unto the judges of israel oh no he just recruited a bunch of preachers oh my goodness we don't need him i just want paul's writings we don't want no fivefold ministry man but we're just going to go back to paul's writings i want to go back to what peter said i want james and john i want somebody this authority that i can trust what they had to say moses said to the judges of israel slay every one of his men that were joined and developed oh you talk about rough come on saints it was rough there were people i only went down there once sorry you joined yourself to that i only hm imagine if god sent them men to preach in our message churches today what would happen come on amen prophet of god said there'd come a day that the holy spirit would call the sin out in the church let's repent saints come on i say this from my heart let's repent come clean before god asks for his mercy before it comes to the day that he calls it out [Music] lift it before the lord the blood is sufficient his grace is sufficient we we don't want to come we don't want to be those people that coming right down to the cusp of a rapture that god says you know what i'm going to force you if i have to force you to repent of that i'll call your name and your sin over the pulpit that's right when we can just go freely and say lord forgive me forgive me lord now here's where this gets really rough we thought them guys chomping heads off and hanging them face to the sun we're rough crowd this comes down real personal one of the children of israel come and brought do you realize what they're saying brought a midianite woman into the church brought that sin not even a sacred bone left in their body that's what joining that bail pure does oh we dress right we walk right we talk right and we do everything else but we don't do it openly see how far they went that's right come on and then the side of all the side of moses side of the congregation who were weeping before the door of the tabernacle right this was not a church that gave up this is a church that's calling on god oh lord oh lord have mercy have mercy lord there's a curse upon us have mercy o lord right sighing and crying for the abominations but hallelujah my brother phineas hey man he said there's something i not going to allow beopiore has destroyed our message amen that's joining together this worship together we're all one we can draw ourselves together oh this is so beautiful my brother and sister it come to the point that that was there that's what was happening there but this came a real personal thing and phineas he didn't sit back and say you know what i think the pastor will take care of it i think this will take care of it we'll let god take care of it the anointing of the holy ghost come upon him and when he saw that man come right through the midst of the people inside of a prophet amen you know what my brother sister now this might seem like a different statement but i hope you catch the context of it this message the prophet of god is still on the scene are you with me he's still on the scene these words that he spoke are the life that god spoke through him and so as a messenger he is still on the scene through the message he was called to deliver there's not here in a physical form and we do not expect to see him until the resurrection but my brother and sister is still here this is the word that god used him for and that word is a living word and the messenger that brought it was sanctified to handle right off the altar of god and bring the word to you and i that would cleanse us now somebody will say oh brother paul's in some weird doctrine no if you can't get that you need to go study your message amen so it's still alive just like the gospel of paul still alive amen every one of those gospels and through the ages my brother and sister the very words that jesus spoke on the road to emmaus now if you want another sign of it they're proven brother branham talks about this that every word that was spoken is still out here in the atmosphere amen right if that don't get any more real to you than that amen radio waves is a proof of that tv you know proof of that hallelujah amen so we look he comes brings this midianite woman parades her right through the midst of the people right through the midst of the church and says hey look the church has got lacks enough come on saints are you with me no bro paul you're putting a spin on it well let me put a spin on it you throw it away later that's it the churches got so lacks we can do what we want to do and nobody's going to say a word about it we're going to just waltz our cute little midianite girl right down through the midst of the church because nobody's going to do anything but what they didn't know is times and seasons and god said the time for this to be alive in the midst of israel of the bride of christ is over amen something happened that day he didn't get the memo and he waltzes her right down there and walks her right through i don't mean to be crass walks are right through the flap of the tent amen and now look brother and sister here again i don't mean to be crass but he'll tell you and and so here's phineas i'm just all wowed up here sorry the son of elijah the son of aaron the priest saw and he rose up from among the congregation took a javelin in his hand and he went in after the man of israel in the tent and thrust them uh both of them through amen that means one was on top of the other already i don't mean to be crass but they they were they were they were doing their thing they were whatever amen and he goes in there amen through the man of israel through the woman through her belly so the plague stayed from the children of israel amen pretty rough preaching ain't it come on amen we're called to stand for the word if there's going to be a unity if there's going to be a joining together i'm going to be joined to the word amen i don't need bail peor i don't need their altar i don't need their feast amen i don't need to bow to their god i've already got an altar amen i've already got the word for the hour and i've already got jehovah jireh hey man i've got a provider i've got one who's sufficient he's my all in all he's everything he's a blood that forgive my sin amen he's washed me wider than so i don't need to bow to the altar of some other god in the name of unity now some people say brother paul you're harsh no i'm a realist amen i want to take you right back prophet of god said those spirits don't die hallelujah sister emmy come before i go to part two hallelujah while she's coming we're going to go through this real quick god this is speaking of jesus christ so you'll understand god then what was he doing what is that attraction up there on the hill it's god making history god fulfilling prophecy and that always causes an attraction that brings all the critics up the vultures now look at this when i read this it just stunned me parentheses the prophet of god said of this morning's message he was dealing with the same spirits he was dealing with the same thing but we have our exemption card that allows us to go past go and collect 200 right no sorry we're pure he was persecuted meaning our lord jesus will be persecuted we should be saying thank you that i could be persecuted for your sake it brings all the critics up the vultures of this morning's message i'm sure there'll be a few critics of this morning's message and the eagles also see they come together to find out what's going on some come for curiosity some come to find fault others coming to criticize there's all kinds gathered as we said this morning believers make believers unbelievers what's on the mountain prophecy is being fulfilled now we'll see what takes place now in the book of zechariah in the ninth chapter ninth verse zechariah one of the prophets spoke in the spirit saying this rejoice greatly o daughters of zion shadow daughters of jerusalem behold thy king cometh unto thee he is just having salvation lowly riding upon an ass upon the fall the cult the full of an ass now what was the matter with those scribes what was the matter with those priests what was the matter with those religious people this was wrote 487 years before it happened by a vindicated prophet and was already put into writings called the bible the scrolls of the old testament why couldn't they see that that's prophecy being fulfilled why saints the same reason they can't see it today they had took the word of god and made it non-effect to the people and i i'm not closing this negative note saints but i'm telling you it's happening today this message is being made non-effect to the people god help me as long as there's breath in this body and i'm pastor of this church this message will be alive and well that it will have an effect by teaching for traditions the doctrine the traditions of man and if scribe preachers ministers spiritual man so-called anointed ones would only read the bible they wouldn't be wondering what's taking place they would know what it is god fulfilling his word hallelujah now i've got some other commentary but can i just read this scripture let's stand and let's just read this scripture here i believe this is a lovely scripture it stirs my the steps of a good man are ordered by the lord and he delighteth in his way though he fall my brother and sister do you understand it wasn't oh i hope you see that it wasn't that they made mistakes at baal pure but the scripture says they joined it they didn't make a mistake they made a conscious decision to embrace what midian moabites a good old moabite church first church of the moabites had quotes of abram [Music] wow though he fall that means make a mistake he shall not be utterly cast down for the lord upholdeth him with his hand do you feel his hand this morning i tell you every day of my life i feel his hand it's around me i make sense i make enough mistakes to fill a bus but i see god's mercy and there's something i mean to boast i know i'm saying it as a boaster there's something that's real to me and that is i say sorry lord forgive me lord a lot of times a day sometimes when i want to jump out of a chopper and choke somebody i i don't i don't i don't but i think it and even though i thought it and you wouldn't know it except for i told you about it i still stop and i say oh god forgive me forgive me keep me tender lord keep me so tender lord because you see my brother and sister you just look around can i give you can i share a hint with you [Music] if it's you in the mirror or someone else when you find a christian with a hard shell something's wrong you find a preacher with a hard shell i remember from my youth sitting in a service the preacher's saying y'all don't repent i'm gonna write your name on this board saints i don't say this as humorous nature hard not imploring them if you're sinning if you're not doing right come to the altar come to christ threatening hard and i look back and i say lord why didn't i have courage enough to jump up and say start with your sons [Music] but i was timid i didn't want to be ashamed i didn't want to be rejected i didn't want to do it so i just went with the flow and i it happened to be a flow of lemmings and we all just marched off a cliff into the antarctic into the arctic ocean because everyone else is doing it everyone in the message we know is doing it let's find it just find a message that everyone is at the altar crying out to god fill me lord fill me lord let's find another example let's find another something to look up to to find those that are saying lord fill us with the holy ghost lord we need you we want you lord look to a different example if your example is something that's empty and angry and hard over here look to a different example hallelujah oh hallelujah oh hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah i'm leaving out some i'm just flipped through here i'm looking some of this i should have preached that oh the steps of a good man are ordered by the lord he delighteth in his way though he fall he shall not be utterly cast down for the lord upholdeth him with his hand i have been young and now am old yet have i not seen the righteous forsaken nor his seed begging bread he is ever merciful and lindeth and his seed is his seed is blessed who's blessed here this morning hallelujah his seed is blessed oh i'm claiming that i'm his seed and i i can tell you i look at my life i am blessed hallelujah depart from evil and do good dwell forevermore for the lord loveth judgment and forsaketh not his saints they are preserved forever but the seed of the wicked [Music] cut off the righteous shall inherit the land and dwell therein forever you realize that moab had no prophetic claim to the promised land in fact they had no promised land period oh my brother and sister i'm not gonna go worship at an altar that takes my inheritance from me i'm gonna find an altar amen i'm not promoting grace tabernacle i'm not promoting paul haylett but i'm going to find a church that has said we can live clean we will live clean we'll live upright we'll live holy we'll be righteous because the word said we can that's why we will be that oh hallelujah hallelujah my my mind i told myself don't preach long today paul don't preach long amen oh brother jay if you'd come help me oh hallelujah [Music] oh hallelujah in the morning when i rise hallelujah i don't need a minion altar i don't need something from the book of moab amen in the morning when i rise i just need my lord jesus hallelujah you love him today saints oh i thank god for his grace and mercy every day just gets more beautiful it's more beautiful amen now i'll do my very best you pray for brother paul we'll move on to things amen i'm i'm done with bail people well i'm not done with bill pj or i take that back i just lied [Music] i'll never be done with bail because you see my brother and sister if i can just say this you know those judges in israel that were cutting them heads off hanging them facing the sun hallelujah i've got the same sword i got the same sword i'm not here to cut somebody's head off but we're here to cut away everything that's not of god amen everything that's just addition that was taught something that was just brought out oh this is how it is we're going to just love we're going to love love love well i'll tell you what i was a child born in the early 60s and it was still alive and well when i was old enough to recognize the age of love the season of love the time of love generation of love what did it produce perversion a next generation that raised the next generation that raised a generation that's burning down their cities according to the scripture oh hallelujah the scripture says those anointed by satan would burn their cities oh my it's happening it's happening hallelujah [Music] in the morning when rise give me jesus [Music] but give me and when i am alone when i am alone [Music] give me jesus oh when i am afraid oh when i am afraid give me jesus is but give me jesus oh when i am in prayer oh when i [Music] hear oh me me jesus [Music] hallelujah [Music] i just want to close my thoughts saints with this i don't believe in preaching what's wrong in the message is the answer i believe we preach what is right i don't believe in spending all our time saying don't do this don't fellowship there and don't partake in that and don't don't don't i don't believe in that but there comes a time saints in a season the prophet of god said these things would come in a full circle as it was in the beginning scriptural right as it was in the beginning so shall it be at the end this has come a full circle and i believe just uh shared this story with you the other day you see a coyote in the pasture and you sit back and watch it kill a sheep [Music] can you say well god's in control no if i've offended anyone forgive me it was not my intent but my intent my brother and sister is to point out the fact that the holy ghost unity by bringing the bride back to the word amen which is christ himself and when we come back in that all of our differences i might have a difference with you all of our differences are then settled because we're both embracing the word hallelujah a false sense of if we're going to be real message believers the prophet said oh my brother and sister we can say the prophet said but jesus said if you love me do my commandments and if you can prove to me the prophet said something different i'll stand corrected but you won't find it you can't find it because the scripture says change one word there's curse upon you this word that god brought to us you realize that same jesus that same one that stood in the midst of the candlesticks is here this morning he cannot contradict himself oh hallelujah i love you i feel a little bit bad on one side that i kept you so long but now it's off my chest hallelujah i love you so much saints i want to i want to be in the rapture with each one of you i want to sit there at the marriage supper across the table from you and talk of all the things we never had time to talk of here and to worship together it's my heart's cry it's it's all that [Music] it's all that there is to live for that's all that's real without that we have nothing it's life is a vapor an empty shell but it is real it is so real it just is that day on the side of a mountain just as it was on the side of a mountain i made a promise to god i will serve you and i don't care what comes my way also i'll serve him and no my address is not outside of a cave hallelujah my address is on top of the mountain with the fire of god burning for ultimately hallelujah i want god's way to me my way as i journey below oh hallelujah hallelujah it don't need to be perfect brother jay just sing it [Music] [Applause] [Music] for hallelujah is no other highway that a child of god should go roll the road [Music] i want god's way to be my way every day oh i want god's way to be my way as i journey here below for there is no other highway that a child of god should go will the road he leads me tears enough i want god's way to be my way every day [Music] is [Music] [Music] all the way i've got my mind made up i've got my heart fixed right i'm going with jesus all the way

courage lord i'll bear the door and enter the pain supported by thy word foreign i'm going with jesus all the way [Music] lift one another up in prayer now i don't mean to be but presumptuous tell you what works you just start on one end of the valley and you just pray for every single individual [Music] until you get to the other end of the valley now that you're on in into the valley you've got to get back so just pray for him on the way back hallelujah prayer change this thing and my prayer hallelujah are you with me and my prayer makes a difference hallelujah god bless you sorry for keeping you so late in one sense glad you were here i could get it off my chest amen hallelujah because you see saints the devil [Music] [Music] because the holy ghost comes down and discerns the thoughts and the intents and he's the one that says i see a wolf coming hey son daughter watch pretty soon i tell you what i'm i just have to look up to these things brother donny brings out in such a way he said you know a son of god with the holy ghost [Music] he's going through life he's going to work he's going to the grocery store he's going to church and you'll see him my little our little

oh my i could just preach another sermon right now god bless you saints greet one another take the presence of god with you amen if the pastor the preacher preaches too long to what don't criticize him pray for him okay just pray for him and you can be blunt right that's the thing about praying to the lord you can be pretty blunt lord just shorten the preacher amen but you don't want to starve to death either okay when you say oh you fix too much food and the next dish you get will be toast hallelujah god bless i love you in the [Music] lord i've got my mind made up [Music] [Applause]
