[21:50] rynason has invited everyone who can
[21:54] make it for their 50th anniversary party

[21:58] I think that's this Sunday at 7
[22:01] no the 7th that's the seventh it's not
[22:04] that seven but I think it's right after
[22:05] a morning service so the time is on on
[22:08] that bulletin board if you want to take
[22:10] a look at that amen as we get ready to
[22:13] turn the service to brother Paul let's
[22:15] sing number nine twenty eight
[22:20] [Music]
[22:29] there are some people they cannot
[22:36] whether we are saved or whether all this
[22:41] way
[22:45] Russ
[22:50] but I was there and I get by
[22:55] I've never laid me bearable he forgave
[23:01] me
[23:03] put away my baby burden and it gave me
[23:06] peace with it
[23:09] brain fried baked out
[23:12] but I'm gonna shout it I was there when
[23:17] it happened
[23:18] and I guess I odd
[23:22] I don't care
[23:25] salvation is not free
[23:29] they argue they attend not me
[23:38] and the bowels let's go
[23:40] [Music]
[23:42] I was there when it happened and I guess
[23:45] Sion
[23:48] I would say me very low would be a heavy
[23:56] burden and he gave me peace with a vain
[24:02] tries to make it down
[24:04] but I'm gonna have it I was there when
[24:09] it happened and I guess I
[24:14] I was ever gonna say me very poor but he
[24:19] gave me
[24:21] but where the head burden and he gave me
[24:25] fits with it
[24:27] pay prize fake doubters
[24:31] but I'm gonna shout it
[24:34] probably when it happened and I guess I
[24:41] it saved me very cold he forgave me
[24:49] and he gave me
[24:54] down
[25:00] I was there when it happened
[25:03] dying inside
[25:08] and it's still happening amen he's still
[25:12] on the scene he's still moving he's
[25:14] still changing lives amen god bless you
[25:17] good to see each and every one of you
[25:19] amen well as we would just go once again
[25:23] following up on our preparations of the
[25:26] inner man this evening I want to just
[25:29] talk to you on the subject of becoming
[25:32] our calling
[25:34] amen so the call was made now the word
[25:38] is changing you and I and bringing us to
[25:42] a place we are becoming exactly what the
[25:46] word said we would be Amen don't doubt
[25:50] it just believe it Amen he promised it
[25:54] we experienced it and Lissa believe it
[25:58] it's going to come to its full work or
[26:00] completion amen well let's just stand
[26:02] this evening
[26:04] oh is it not working
[26:09] hmm well be like everything else I come
[26:14] today amen well let's turn in our Bibles
[26:17] to John the 1st chapter starting with
[26:20] verse 11 I believe it's very familiar
[26:23] Scripture to us in fact I kind of if
[26:26] someone was to say what is your favorite
[26:28] Scripture I'd have to say John one would
[26:31] fall right into that category just
[26:34] lovely very enlightening passages of
[26:39] Scripture amen let's just start in verse
[26:42] 11 and it says he came into his own and
[26:46] his own received him not but as many as
[26:51] received him now the beautiful thing is
[26:54] is we can count ourselves in that number
[26:58] Amen as many as received him to them
[27:02] gave he power to become the sons of God
[27:05] so to those who didn't ever receive him
[27:08] they might have religious spirit they
[27:11] might be faithful in church they might
[27:13] believe there is a God but my brother
[27:15] and sister if they have not received him
[27:18] amen now we could go into a lot of
[27:21] things but
[27:21] I don't want to get sidetracked tonight
[27:22] but he said you know that when they come
[27:25] and said Lord did we not do many mighty
[27:27] works in thy name he says depart from me
[27:30] I never knew you amen and that's because
[27:34] they never truly received him they knew
[27:38] that God was real
[27:39] they knew that all these promises were
[27:42] real but they had never received the
[27:44] person of Jesus Christ amen
[27:48] but as many as received him to them gave
[27:51] he power now you stand here tonight I
[27:54] don't know what your day your week what
[27:56] is going on in your life but I want you
[27:58] to understand he's gave you the power to
[28:00] become sons of God even to them that
[28:04] believe on his name which were born hmm
[28:09] I like this because the spiritual DNA my
[28:12] brother and sister is much more
[28:13] important than a natural DNA which were
[28:17] born not of blood nor of the will of the
[28:20] flesh nor of the will of man but of God
[28:24] and the Word was made flesh and dwelt
[28:28] among us and we beheld his glory the
[28:31] glory as of the only begotten of the
[28:34] Father full of grace and truth
[28:37] Heavenly Father we thank you tonight
[28:39] Lord for your grace for your mercy Lord
[28:42] as we live out our lives father just
[28:46] realizing father that we make mistakes
[28:48] day by day circumstances arise father to
[28:53] know and have that confidence that your
[28:55] blood is more than sufficient Lord the
[28:58] work that you have begun will be
[29:00] finished and we stand Father upon that
[29:02] knowing that you are here present with
[29:05] us the Word made flesh
[29:08] once again we ask you to bless his
[29:10] service father Lord just take father
[29:14] every contrary thought that Satan might
[29:17] come in any spirits any sleepiness
[29:19] anything like that we bind all of that
[29:22] in the name of Jesus Christ
[29:24] thanking you Lord for this time in your
[29:27] name amen
[29:28] you may be seated
[29:32] now my brother and sister just to take a
[29:36] thought out of John one for just a
[29:38] moment as many as received him as they
[29:41] come into that personal relationship
[29:44] when God gives power to sons and
[29:46] daughters of God he didn't come and just
[29:49] hand us as it were a jar he didn't hand
[29:51] us a box he didn't hand us some kind of
[29:53] deal but it is there my brother and
[29:55] sister that some of the very first power
[29:58] that he gives to sons and daughters of
[30:00] God is that power to be able to come and
[30:04] recognize that this flesh must be
[30:06] subdued to recognize that we have to
[30:09] come into repentance and it takes a
[30:11] power my brother and sister I think you
[30:13] would agree with me that sometimes
[30:15] saying Lord forgive me or saying for
[30:18] forgive me to someone else actually
[30:20] takes a tremendous influence upon our
[30:23] life it's easy to just let it go away as
[30:26] though it never happened but to have the
[30:29] power to be able to say forgive me or to
[30:31] look to our Lord Jesus and say Lord I
[30:33] know that wasn't right remember the
[30:35] prophet of God told us you know that
[30:37] when the Holy Spirit comes down you do
[30:39] something wrong the Holy Spirit moves
[30:42] right in upon you starts to deal with
[30:44] you that's the time to repent hey man
[30:46] don't let Satan build up a bulwark
[30:48] around that I know from experience that
[30:51] if you leave it long enough you'll
[30:52] justify it
[30:53] amen you'll finally say well they really
[30:55] deserve this or that or whatever they
[30:58] deserve these words or our actions or
[31:00] whatever it might have been so what we
[31:02] want to do is always keep that slate
[31:04] clean amen so he gave us the power and
[31:07] that power my brother and sister the
[31:10] word shows us how it come down how the
[31:12] Holy Spirit moving upon us he sends his
[31:14] spirit back upon the people now my
[31:17] brother and sister we won't go into this
[31:18] tonight but the prophet of God shows us
[31:21] that the Holy Spirit moving on us is God
[31:23] himself some people you know would say
[31:25] well it's just the Holy Spirit no my
[31:27] brother and sister the Holy Spirit is
[31:28] gone whose spirit is it it's his spirit
[31:31] amen it's not an intermediary he didn't
[31:34] go find someone else and say hey go down
[31:36] there to do that my brother and sister
[31:38] it's God's Spirit on you and I Amen the
[31:41] Holy Ghost amen so it's there that as we
[31:44] recognize
[31:45] and this power starts to come to
[31:48] fruition my brother and sister it's not
[31:50] just a power to overcome the world many
[31:53] people live good godly lives their their
[31:55] dis various religions and and you know
[31:58] they don't smoke they don't drink they
[31:59] don't curse they don't do these things
[32:01] they're kind to their neighbor they're
[32:02] patient all of these virtues my brother
[32:04] and sister but they will not unless they
[32:07] have the Holy Ghost been filled with the
[32:09] Holy Ghost been born again they will not
[32:12] dwell in the presence of Almighty God so
[32:15] this is not just about overcoming a
[32:17] drinking habit of smoking habit a
[32:19] cursing habit uh whatever kind of thing
[32:21] this is the power to become sons of God
[32:26] amen that moves up beyond all of those
[32:30] things and moves into a whole nether
[32:32] realm well which we can come and the
[32:35] very life of Jesus Christ the very word
[32:38] of God comes in dwells in us and starts
[32:41] to guide our lives amen boy Satan sure
[32:44] don't like that does he amen and he will
[32:46] kick and he will scream and he will
[32:48] holler and he will drop every kind of
[32:51] roadblock he can but we have power to go
[32:54] beyond Satan's roadblock amen
[32:57] even to them that believe on his name
[32:59] now my brother and sister the Word of
[33:00] God shows us that you can't even really
[33:02] understand the Bible without the Holy
[33:05] Ghost so and we'll look at this and we
[33:07] say that the scripture says even to them
[33:10] that believe on his name I'm gonna step
[33:12] out you say well do you have something
[33:14] to prove it brother Paul only continuity
[33:16] of the word and that is my brother and
[33:18] sister you can't really believe on his
[33:20] name until revelation has struck you
[33:23] Amen so people are there they say well
[33:26] you know Jesus Christ is a healer but
[33:29] yet when put face to face they actually
[33:31] don't even believe he heals they can say
[33:34] God is present but then they might say
[33:36] where is he and these kind of things now
[33:39] look my brother and sister what we are
[33:41] there is to recognize our DNA to
[33:44] recognize that the pedigree that God has
[33:48] given to you and I now if we could look
[33:50] beyond the curtain of time look beyond
[33:52] the veil we would look out there and we
[33:55] could come and as it were just bear with
[33:57] me this evening please
[33:59] but we could go and step beyond the veil
[34:02] and come in there and they would be a
[34:03] great filing cabinet as it were probably
[34:06] because I'm that far behind on all of
[34:08] this stuff to some of you it might be a
[34:10] database on the computer but for me it's
[34:13] still a filing cabinet and so you could
[34:15] open that filing cabinet and in there
[34:18] you would find your pedigree think about
[34:26] it it would be declaring who your
[34:32] father's father's father's father was
[34:36] but you see in the natural there would
[34:38] be various names but in this spiritual
[34:41] you would open that up and pull out your
[34:44] pedigree and there would be only one
[34:46] name in there as your father amen we
[34:50] didn't have a father here and a father
[34:52] there we had one father from the
[34:54] creation of the earth amen to this
[34:57] moment right now and so we can look back
[34:59] and realize that we always as brother
[35:02] Branham says is what we always was in
[35:04] him he said if he wasn't always in him
[35:07] amen you wouldn't be in him now amen
[35:09] well some people might struggle over
[35:11] that but I just got saved I'm sorry you
[35:13] were always in him amen so it's there
[35:16] that we come to the place and we look at
[35:18] this now some people would disagree with
[35:20] what I'm fixing to say here my brother
[35:23] and sister the prophet of God told us
[35:25] showed us how the description have dual
[35:27] fold or trifold meaning and at the word
[35:30] verse 14 and the word was made flesh and
[35:33] dwelt among us amen we beheld his glory
[35:36] the glory as of the only whole only
[35:38] begotten of the Father full of grace and
[35:40] truth the verse 14 can apply right here
[35:43] on this date in 2020 my brother and
[35:46] sister he is right here in the midst of
[35:49] his people being made flesh once again
[35:52] amen it's not you and I as it were a God
[35:56] with authority but we are here I mean
[35:59] God with power we are as God with
[36:01] authority because we come down and what
[36:04] we bind amen that wasn't just for some
[36:06] Minister what we bind on earth would be
[36:09] bound in heaven my brother's sister
[36:10] wasn't just for Martin Luther
[36:12] John Wesley or for brother branham or it
[36:15] was for sons and daughters of God that
[36:17] we can come into a place of authority
[36:20] what is it it's the preparation of the
[36:22] inner man and you know as well as I do
[36:25] it takes time and it takes struggle and
[36:28] if we're a faith is afraid to face the
[36:30] struggle my brother and sister if we're
[36:32] afraid to face the storm then we will
[36:36] not overcome amen you've got to be
[36:39] willing to stand up and say Lord
[36:41] whatever would come my way I might fall
[36:43] down but I will get up hey man I might
[36:46] not understand but I will pray for
[36:48] Revelation I will ask and I will be
[36:52] patient to receive Amen many times we
[36:56] get so impatient I say Lord what
[36:58] happened to us you know always use a
[37:00] telephone as an example you know it
[37:02] might be I won't throw it off on any of
[37:05] you but I think you all will be kind in
[37:06] the same boat you know I call my wife
[37:08] she doesn't answer for like what is
[37:11] wrong with her she has a telephone she
[37:12] needs to answer it she's not smiling
[37:19] but that's symbolic of the age that
[37:22] we've come in they've got a telephone
[37:25] they should answer well you know my
[37:29] brother and sister we approach God this
[37:30] way we ring him up come on answer I want
[37:36] an answer
[37:37] I don't want voicemail I don't want to
[37:39] wait I don't have to ask again I want an
[37:43] answer when a Satan is greatest tools
[37:46] gets us to the place we become impatient
[37:49] with our God all my brother and sister
[37:53] some people might say well you know I
[37:55] asked God for this and I asked God for
[37:56] that but he did not answer he did not
[37:58] come my brother and sister the problem
[38:01] is is we put God on our timetable and we
[38:05] need to get on God's timetable amen when
[38:09] we get on God's timetable we'll find
[38:11] that we will have some peace we will
[38:14] find have some joy because we can just
[38:16] settle down and say you know what I
[38:18] asked my motive was right my objective
[38:21] was right my desire of the depths of my
[38:23] heart was right now I know that God is
[38:25] faith
[38:26] and I'm just gonna sit back and I'm just
[38:28] gonna thank God for what he's going to
[38:31] do I'm gonna thank him for what he's
[38:33] done he's doing today I'm gonna thank
[38:35] him for what he's gonna do tomorrow
[38:36] because I want to be on God's timetable
[38:39] you know I've said this a little bit
[38:41] recently I don't mean to belabor it but
[38:43] that's where some of these doctrines
[38:44] have come in is because people weren't
[38:47] willing to wait for God's timetable so
[38:49] they had to move an important man and
[38:51] they had to give him more authority than
[38:53] the Word of God even gave him give to
[38:55] all these things to him and when that
[38:57] man says this is this then they jump
[38:59] right on that but my brother and sister
[39:01] let God manifest his own word a man as
[39:05] God's heir you know I just hearing
[39:06] brother Branham say you know God will
[39:08] interpret or God does interpret his own
[39:11] word he does not need you and I to
[39:13] interpret it he doesn't need us to come
[39:16] and take the front half of it quote the
[39:18] middle of that one and the last of that
[39:20] put it together and come up with some
[39:22] conclusion my brother and sister now
[39:24] this I say this a little bit in humor
[39:26] but I have seen a cow in a tree hey man
[39:29] I have seen a cow try to climb over a
[39:31] branch and a tree and get stuck there so
[39:34] you know you can get the cow up in the
[39:35] tree my brother and sister the problem
[39:38] is that isn't where the cow belongs no
[39:40] matter what kind of circumstance that
[39:42] you have done it's not for us to try and
[39:44] shift all of this it's for us to sit
[39:47] back and watch God move now when I ask
[39:51] you a direct question tonight is God
[39:53] moving or not amen and if we say God's
[39:56] not moving then my brother and sister
[39:58] it's not God that's got a problem it's
[40:00] you and I that's got a problem amen
[40:03] so as Paul is speaking here in Romans 1
[40:06] and 11 amen he says for I long to see
[40:10] you that I may impart unto you some
[40:13] spiritual gift to the end he may be
[40:16] established now my brother and sister
[40:19] pardon me but I've just got to you know
[40:21] just kind of bring this as he's coming
[40:24] there he's speaking to them I long to
[40:26] see you then I may impart to you some
[40:28] spiritual gift he was not coming to hand
[40:31] them something he did not come to hand
[40:35] them the teachings of Paul he did not
[40:37] come to give them Scrolls
[40:39] and this and that or some gift my
[40:42] brother and sister reminds me I say this
[40:44] humorous not to get to deeper serious
[40:46] tonight but it reminds me one time many
[40:49] many years ago
[40:50] net we went down to a missionary
[40:52] conference that was in Phoenix and after
[40:55] that they had a tour of Sabino Canyon
[40:58] they had visiting brother branham's
[41:03] house the den and some of those things
[41:06] that took place you know they went down
[41:07] to Tucson to do that brother Perry green
[41:10] and and I just remember we were there
[41:12] brother Lonnie
[41:13] gingka was there and and I thanked the
[41:15] Lord for that not lifting the man up but
[41:17] he had some special feeling for us and
[41:20] and he cared about us come many times to
[41:22] encourage the little group that was here
[41:24] and and was actually a catalyst for
[41:26] housebreaking our are out of our rotten
[41:29] and these sayings but I remember that
[41:31] you know just a pep talks of life I
[41:33] don't believe in double standards but my
[41:35] brother and sisters sometimes things
[41:37] just work in such a way and there was a
[41:39] family there and and you know their kids
[41:42] you know they have the little things you
[41:44] know don't go beyond this you know stay
[41:46] outside of these things here kind of
[41:48] roped off and these kids was up petting
[41:50] you know and trying to handle brother
[41:52] branham's gun and petting the caribou
[41:54] and you know and and brother George he
[41:57] was kind of coming to the end of his
[41:59] wits there and finally he was like you
[42:01] kids out of here and so you know they're
[42:05] like shocked like serious and he's like
[42:07] I said out of here so they they went out
[42:11] and it wasn't two minutes I look over
[42:14] and brother Lonnie's there standing and
[42:16] he's looking at something he just steps
[42:18] over the little barricade and he just
[42:21] walks right up there I think brother
[42:23] George went blind at that moment amen
[42:26] but you know there was like a reverence
[42:28] right he wasn't really trying to break
[42:30] the rules but there was a reverence
[42:31] there but you know these little kids
[42:34] there was a bowl right there on the desk
[42:36] just inside the door of the den and it
[42:39] had all these rocks in and brother
[42:40] George was very clear to tell everybody
[42:42] these are just rocks like brother
[42:45] branham liked to have he and he said
[42:48] these come from such-and-such rock shop
[42:50] downtown Tucson these are
[42:53] brother branham's rocks well a few
[42:55] minutes later here comes one of those
[42:57] little kids he sticks his head in the
[42:59] door and brother George is over there
[43:01] talking to us looking her there but I
[43:02] was on the angle the kid tiptoes in
[43:05] there dips to hands into them rocks gets
[43:08] him these big ol handfuls of rocks and
[43:10] tiptoes out of there and then Here Come
[43:12] his little sister she come right in
[43:14] behind it she got a handful of rock
[43:16] she's on the way out and brother George
[43:18] is like go out and stay out but my
[43:22] brother and sister you see somehow or
[43:23] another they took that rock that was
[43:26] just a common rock it was an anointed
[43:27] rock it wasn't blasted out of a mountain
[43:29] it wasn't prayed over by a prophet but
[43:31] they took that rock and put some kind of
[43:34] special significance to that rock and it
[43:37] becomes some kind of a focal point for
[43:39] them my brother and sister I never even
[43:41] pocketed a single one of them they came
[43:43] from a rock shop somebody would had to
[43:45] bought some more I didn't need to bring
[43:47] it home and add it to my collection amen
[43:49] but you see what happens is is if we
[43:52] come and somebody's imparting something
[43:55] many times if we're not careful as
[43:57] humans we we put a great importance upon
[44:01] what was imparted to us somebody gives a
[44:03] gift my brother and sister if no value I
[44:05] remember many years ago there was a
[44:07] brother I knew for certain that he was
[44:11] kind of struggling too he lived too high
[44:13] of a lifestyle had too many toys and
[44:16] struggling to pay his house payment and
[44:18] he brought a gun bought it bought a
[44:20] pistol for another brother named Anna
[44:23] minister and and I was sitting there as
[44:26] a young man and he gives this gift and
[44:29] that brother leaves and goes away and
[44:32] the Menace minister sitting there and he
[44:34] makes a statement he says well I don't
[44:36] know why he bought me this piece of junk
[44:37] I can buy stuff like this all day long
[44:39] see my brother and sister the gift that
[44:42] was imparted had no value to that
[44:45] individual amen but the man who gave it
[44:48] was doing it out of utmost respect to
[44:51] that individual you see so we have to be
[44:53] careful when we start looking at gifts
[44:55] and imparting zhh and whatever and when
[44:57] Paul come to the Romans my brother and
[44:59] sister he wasn't bringing them something
[45:01] that they could take and go home and put
[45:03] it on his shelf he was coming to impart
[45:06] of life amen he was coming to impart
[45:09] revealed word for their dates
[45:11] he was imparting to them the Spirit of
[45:13] Almighty God now the scripture my
[45:16] brother sister you go back in there and
[45:17] you go back in the Old Testament you
[45:20] don't find no reference of the Holy
[45:21] Ghost amen you come into the new
[45:23] testament of ways before you see
[45:25] reference of the Holy Ghost but you see
[45:27] God in his spirit upon man has always
[45:31] been present so whether you find the
[45:33] words Holy Ghost or not if God's Spirit
[45:36] has always come upon man hey man it was
[45:38] there that very same anointing would
[45:40] have been in the garden with Adam now
[45:43] God didn't come down my brother and
[45:45] sister and just come as a person to
[45:47] excuse me a person to a person God dealt
[45:51] with Adam in the spirit realm also amen
[45:54] he didn't send him a notice he didn't uh
[45:58] you know and videoconference and say hey
[46:00] now look you know that that animal with
[46:03] the long tail with a little hair on the
[46:05] end and all that here around his head
[46:07] you know with them cute little ears and
[46:09] then big aw he's a lion it was by the
[46:12] spirit a man by the anointing of God
[46:14] Adam knew what to speak and he was
[46:17] anointed by the Holy Ghost the very life
[46:20] of God to name the animals and name all
[46:23] specie and all flora and fauna now my
[46:26] brother and sisters will look at this
[46:28] and realize that Apostle Paul now had
[46:30] caught this revelation that he could
[46:33] impart the Spirit of God it wasn't like
[46:36] some free gift but it was imparting the
[46:39] knowledge of what the presence of God
[46:41] was in their life amen in other words
[46:44] how to unlock the door to have a greater
[46:47] portion of God amen how to unlock that
[46:51] and have that personal relationship say
[46:54] Paul wasn't given them a one step or two
[46:56] step or 10 step plan he was actually
[46:59] showing them that beyond the veil is
[47:02] where Christ was amen not out here
[47:06] not in ceremony not in your name being
[47:09] on a book not in the name of your church
[47:11] not in who you knew but to impart Christ
[47:15] himself to the people amen that the end
[47:19] you may be established
[47:20] see he wasn't trying to bring them to
[47:22] the Gospel of Paul even though God by
[47:24] His infinite wisdom chose to have Paul
[47:27] write the majority of the New Testament
[47:30] as an individual writer it was not the
[47:33] testimony of Paul it was the testimony
[47:36] of Jesus Christ and so the word being
[47:39] established to the people that they
[47:41] might recognize my brother and sister if
[47:43] you were shipwrecked tomorrow on an
[47:45] island there would be no reason for us
[47:47] to say I guess God has departed from us
[47:50] it would be for us to stop and say you
[47:52] know what there's a purpose that God has
[47:54] to be in this circumstance and I'm still
[47:57] gonna praise him I'm still gonna worship
[47:59] Him I'm still gonna pray I'm still you
[48:01] know if I don't have a Bible I'm gonna
[48:03] pray that God would bring the scripture
[48:05] back to my remembrance amen so to be
[48:07] able to have that practical outworking
[48:10] as the words brother Branham says now
[48:12] take that and look it up it'd be good
[48:14] because brother Browns talking about
[48:16] line upon line word upon word to take
[48:19] that as a practical outworking or is it
[48:22] something to debate my brother and
[48:25] sister I say we let it become the
[48:27] practical outworking well we hear
[48:29] preached amen I heard I'm not to throw
[48:32] accolades out in that sense but I
[48:34] haven't listened to it but I heard
[48:35] brother creats Kris preached a lovely
[48:37] sermon this Sunday amen we take that and
[48:40] we build that is now part of our
[48:42] foundation and then we add upon that we
[48:45] don't make it our only foundation we
[48:47] don't make it our cornerstone we don't
[48:49] make it all of that belongs to Christ
[48:50] but word upon word amen
[48:53] I read that quote to you the other day
[48:54] what pun word is what we must do see so
[48:57] faith cometh by hearing and we know what
[49:01] we are hearing the word see if we're
[49:05] hearing a map we're hearing a man's idea
[49:07] of man's content my brother and sister
[49:10] when the man runs out of Revelation then
[49:13] you will run out of Revelation but as
[49:15] Paul was wanting to impart to the Romans
[49:19] amen a spiritual gift God has imparted
[49:22] to you and I that very gift today hey
[49:25] men he sent a prophet to our day this is
[49:27] all well and good he spoke the word but
[49:29] my brother and sister just having the
[49:31] message will not mean that you've been
[49:33] imparted
[49:33] the spiritual gift I know that's a
[49:37] little straight but it's the truth
[49:38] people say we've got the message so
[49:40] we've got it no my brothers sister a lot
[49:42] of people got the message button was
[49:44] never imparted with a spiritual gift to
[49:47] understand that the Prophet was saying
[49:49] Amen because you see ultimately at the
[49:52] end my brother and sister it was God
[49:54] speaking amen we have to recognize that
[49:58] now what are we hearing well the word
[50:01] says that faith cometh by hearing the
[50:06] word Amen not just a preacher but the
[50:11] word Amen if we're just going because
[50:14] some men are great speakers my brother
[50:16] and sister flamboyant they can really
[50:18] lay things out good but if it's not
[50:21] anointed to touch you and then it will
[50:24] just be flamboyant preaching but what we
[50:27] want is the Holy Spirit right because
[50:29] the Prophet shows us how that your need
[50:31] and your desire is going to control what
[50:35] the preacher preaches amen that's not
[50:38] verbatim but you know what I'm saying
[50:40] he shows it my brother and sister you
[50:42] actually control the gift that's why I
[50:45] encourage with everything that is within
[50:47] me that we don't just come to church for
[50:49] the sake of coming to church you need to
[50:52] stop somewhere during your day of the
[50:54] previous days or even on Wednesday or if
[50:57] your days been your type in so busy
[50:59] maybe it might even be at the point of
[51:01] driving to church but I encourage you to
[51:04] open your mouth and say Lord I have this
[51:08] need I have this that I do not
[51:10] understand Lord I want to know you more
[51:13] and Lord anoint that man to speak what
[51:17] it is I need hear not what tickles my
[51:21] ears now what makes me happy not even
[51:24] necessarily what I agree with but let it
[51:27] be the truth and then I can take a hold
[51:30] of that and anchor upon that and then I
[51:33] will grow spiritually because there my
[51:36] brother and sister God doesn't come and
[51:37] say well you know what I gotta choose a
[51:39] certain man and he's the only one I
[51:41] impart my gift through my brother and
[51:43] sister that's nonsense but I'll tell you
[51:45] God will use certain
[51:47] people in a certain day a certain
[51:49] service a certain circumstance to impart
[51:52] the Word of Life amen you know you can
[51:55] come and you can have somebody you know
[51:58] this has happened to me I certainly
[52:00] don't put myself in the position of any
[52:02] importance but I've seen this happen
[52:04] that you know that the church and the
[52:07] ministry has been preaching they preach
[52:09] it straight they preach it strong and
[52:11] you know something will happen and then
[52:13] you get up and you just preach something
[52:15] that you think you slaughtered and it
[52:17] calls some little girl to get up and
[52:19] come to the altar and say I ain't been
[52:20] living right and I want to give my heart
[52:22] to the Lord you said this this and this
[52:25] and I can't get beyond that amen my
[52:28] brother and sister wasn't the man that
[52:30] spoke this this and this no it was God
[52:33] appointed the season to impart to that
[52:36] young woman initial anointing oh and why
[52:41] do you say initial brother Paul because
[52:43] you see if you don't follow through on
[52:45] that anointing it will fade away my
[52:47] brother and sister it's happened more
[52:49] than once people cry out go to the altar
[52:52] they repent but they don't follow
[52:54] through on that and they find themselves
[52:56] right back where they were
[52:57] and after a while that becomes the habit
[53:00] come on we've all been there and becomes
[53:02] a habit God moved on I'm so sorry and
[53:05] then we come and we fall right back to
[53:07] that position pretty soon we become
[53:08] calloused if you don't think so you just
[53:11] rub your finger on something long enough
[53:13] and then at first it's no big deal then
[53:16] it starts to hurt and then later it gets
[53:17] calloused
[53:19] come on being a callous Christians
[53:21] nothing to be proud about
[53:23] that's nothing to say all praise the
[53:25] Lord nothing fazes me well if you're
[53:27] talking about the devil's tactics then I
[53:29] say hallelujah but if you're talking of
[53:31] nothing fazes you
[53:33] there's calls of for concern hallelujah
[53:37] so is he doing he we're hearing the word
[53:40] my brother and sister I'll say this man
[53:43] never reveals anything man has never
[53:47] revealed anything revelation comes from
[53:51] the Lord amen
[53:53] thank God for revelation amen because
[53:56] that's God dealing with you my brother
[53:58] and sister that's God sharing himself
[54:00] that's God
[54:01] making us it were the introduction to
[54:03] say you know what this is a picture of
[54:05] me Amen Alleluia now to impart I just
[54:09] want to touch on this before I move on
[54:11] Amen is to give something such as a
[54:14] quality to a thing to make something
[54:17] known to someone to give convey or grant
[54:20] from or as if from a store communicate
[54:25] the knowledge of you see Paul was coming
[54:30] to communicate the knowledge that was
[54:34] necessary for you and I to know we are
[54:37] sons of God Amen not just a religion not
[54:42] just a thought but he come to convey to
[54:44] us by the preaching of the word Amen
[54:48] Paul didn't say now he makes reference
[54:51] in in the in the Bible Paul does about
[54:53] reading scrolls and stuff but my brother
[54:56] and sister we're looking at the very
[54:57] word of God and he come to impart to
[55:00] them or give them the knowledge he
[55:03] wasn't saying now come and listen to
[55:05] this or read that he was preacher Paul
[55:08] was a preacher come on let's not let's
[55:13] not get away from that let's not forget
[55:15] Paul was a preacher Amen God sent a
[55:19] prophet to this day my brother and
[55:21] sister he was a preacher he didn't get
[55:25] up there and make all the heat that he
[55:26] makes references but he didn't get up
[55:28] and make a lot of references
[55:29] now go read this over here and go read
[55:32] this book over here and go no my brother
[55:35] and sister he preached this gospel amen
[55:38] and he preached it with power and
[55:39] authority hallelujah Oh bye you see God
[55:44] give His Word and God sent his men
[55:48] because God has something to impart to
[55:51] you and I hallelujah not just so we got
[55:54] the message my brother and sister now
[55:56] look some people feel like you know and
[55:58] I don't want to ruffle no feathers but I
[55:59] is just too good of example I'm not
[56:01] going to go away from it but you know my
[56:04] brother and sister people say well it
[56:06] appears you're going away from the
[56:07] message they spoke this to brother Paul
[56:09] it seems like you're going beyond
[56:11] brother branham you know when I at the
[56:14] time I answered that and said no we're
[56:16] not but you know the more I think about
[56:17] it Amen I am and I ain't well how's that
[56:21] for a two-sided conversation I am and I
[56:24] ain't God sent him as a prophet to our
[56:27] day it's this word that's restoring us
[56:30] Mac but he said I'm gonna decrease and
[56:34] he's going to increase and so at some
[56:36] point oh if I could put it correctly now
[56:39] you know I don't want to be judged by
[56:41] this because I'm not trying to make it a
[56:42] judgmental thing but at some point
[56:44] brother branham will diminish in our
[56:47] eyesight and Christ Himself will
[56:51] increase amen are you with me Church
[56:55] don't want anybody to misunderstand it
[56:57] doesn't mean that one person is being
[56:59] put away or put down or shoved out of
[57:02] the scene it is showing that the
[57:04] preeminence that was preached which was
[57:06] Christ is rising up in the vision of the
[57:10] people Amen what is happening he's
[57:12] imparting to us who we look to Amen who
[57:18] we admire who we door and to realize my
[57:22] brother and sister now you know this
[57:24] goes into all kinds of other things and
[57:26] people get all upset about it but my
[57:28] brother and sister when the prophet of
[57:29] God stood in the pulpit and said thus
[57:32] saith the Lord who was speaking if
[57:37] they'd been brother branham you said
[57:38] thus saith William Branham but it's thus
[57:42] saith the Lord amen we have to recognize
[57:45] that my brother and sister as a vessel
[57:47] he come and did exactly the same thing
[57:51] Paul was doing he come to impart he come
[57:54] to give that gift wasn't his gift but he
[58:00] was imparting it I say thank you or
[58:03] thank you Lord hallelujah amen see God
[58:07] sent his men God had something to impart
[58:09] to you and I amen what is it the ability
[58:13] to tap into a higher life amen see we
[58:16] don't want to be you know this is a
[58:18] thing I said this once and boy this is a
[58:20] few years ago got all kinds of flack and
[58:22] I made a statement then I was coming to
[58:25] a place where maybe I was going to move
[58:27] on say
[58:27] that I followed or believed the message
[58:30] because I had become such a broad
[58:32] connotation so many people people that
[58:36] would about carjacked you arm rob you
[58:38] people that would lie to you people that
[58:40] would rip you off in business said I
[58:41] believe the message where does that
[58:43] value come in my brother and sister and
[58:46] I was really I have to admit I was
[58:48] really discouraged at that time you know
[58:51] about everybody's I believe the message
[58:52] I believe the message you know what
[58:54] we're really looking for was those that
[58:56] wanted to live the message amen not just
[58:59] talk about it or not just have the title
[59:01] of it because to me it had almost
[59:03] declined to the place of saying I'm a
[59:05] Baptist not picking on no Baptist got
[59:08] some really good friends that are
[59:09] Baptists I'm Nazarene I'm Lutheran I'm
[59:13] Catholic whatever it might have been I'm
[59:15] Pentecostal you see when we come to the
[59:18] place that we start to hang a title on
[59:20] there if there's no life behind the
[59:22] title amen my brother and sister jet
[59:25] fuel should have enough to power the jet
[59:31] if it doesn't have enough to power the
[59:34] jet it can't be called jet fuel now the
[59:40] Word of God coming my brother and sister
[59:42] is God's message so Laodicea and if we
[59:45] diminish the power of the word to
[59:48] Laodicea can we come to the place and it
[59:51] doesn't line up that we say it's the
[59:53] message it's someone's message
[59:56] oh my you know what I think Paul
[1:00:02] probably preached about this straight I
[1:00:04] don't think he buttered it up my brother
[1:00:08] and sister I had an uncle years ago he
[1:00:11] loved popcorn every night he had a big
[1:00:15] chair turned on the evening news he
[1:00:20] eaten supper already and my aunt would
[1:00:22] just carry this bowl of popcorn in and
[1:00:26] set it in his lap and my uncle used to
[1:00:30] say if you're having buttered popcorn
[1:00:32] and there's no evidence of the butter in
[1:00:34] the bowl it wasn't buttered popcorn
[1:00:40] I've seen him as a kid tell my aunt hey
[1:00:44] Margie you forgot the butter I buttered
[1:00:48] it no you forgot the butter she'd come
[1:00:51] get it go in there melt more butter pour
[1:00:53] all over it my brother and sister if
[1:00:56] there's no evidence in us then the
[1:01:02] message wasn't present are you with me
[1:01:05] there's got to be evidence in the bowl
[1:01:08] the vessel that the Holy Ghost was
[1:01:11] present amen we can't just say it was
[1:01:14] there oh I'll tell you what had good
[1:01:17] times as a child with my aunt uncle Amen
[1:01:20] now look my brother and sister what God
[1:01:23] is asking or giving to us is the ability
[1:01:25] to tap into the supernatural in second
[1:01:29] Peter 1:11 he says for so an entrance
[1:01:38] amen I want you to see this will just
[1:01:43] take a second it's a little confusing
[1:01:45] because we had we had another Romans 111
[1:01:50] and then we come down here second Peter
[1:01:52] 111 now I want you to read this for
[1:01:54] yourself just maybe you can catch the
[1:01:57] emphasis that we're trying to make
[1:01:59] tonight as as they bring that up you
[1:02:02] look at this now I'll read it to you but
[1:02:04] I want you to read it for yourself in a
[1:02:05] second second Peter 1:11 for so an
[1:02:08] entrance shall be recorded transcribed
[1:02:16] repeated ministered and then
[1:02:24] for so an entrance shall be ministered
[1:02:26] why at the preaching of the word faith
[1:02:29] cometh by hearing hearing the Word of
[1:02:34] God Amen so there's where it comes from
[1:02:38] so an entrance shall be ministered unto
[1:02:40] you in a small portion to show you that
[1:02:43] there is an everlasting Kingdom no my
[1:02:47] brother and sister this is the position
[1:02:48] that God is reaction revealing in many
[1:02:51] cases people that say we know this
[1:02:53] brother Paul what are you preaching
[1:02:54] about we forgot to include the abundant
[1:02:57] part we forgot to come to the place that
[1:03:00] this is not just a little dinky entrance
[1:03:03] that is there my brother and sister
[1:03:05] we're talking now the world that
[1:03:07] struggles out here people who aren't
[1:03:08] sure where they set concerning the Lord
[1:03:11] and their salvation may they have this
[1:03:14] where straight is the way and narrow is
[1:03:17] the gate but my brother and sister do
[1:03:20] you want to know that the bride of Jesus
[1:03:21] Christ whose names on the Lamb's Book of
[1:03:23] Life that a entrance doesn't look like a
[1:03:25] little sliver of a shadow that entrance
[1:03:28] to a son or daughter of God looks very
[1:03:30] big because the revelation that lumen
[1:03:33] AIT's the way in is so incredible to a
[1:03:37] son or daughter of God that while it
[1:03:39] might be very narrow in the life that is
[1:03:42] lived if one is living the life the
[1:03:44] entrance is obvious are you with me Amen
[1:03:48] when you are living the life the
[1:03:50] entrance is obvious I say thank you Lord
[1:03:54] we're not going along as it were trying
[1:03:56] to find some sliver of a way to get in
[1:03:59] my brother and sister it's so those who
[1:04:01] are not living the life the gate closes
[1:04:03] down so narrow they can't find it
[1:04:06] nobody's just going to stagger into
[1:04:07] heaven as though they are lost which
[1:04:09] reminds me how it was when we used to
[1:04:11] have church out on Garrety Amen there
[1:04:13] was a bar moved into the at far into
[1:04:15] that strip mall a bar moved in there and
[1:04:18] that bar was so much popular we gained
[1:04:20] one or two people in the church during
[1:04:22] that time and the bar took over every
[1:04:24] building right down to us and we would
[1:04:26] be having church you remember that
[1:04:28] sister sue we'd be having church and the
[1:04:30] door would open up and here would be
[1:04:33] these dudes with a long net beer bottle
[1:04:35] in their hand they'd stagger and they'd
[1:04:36] be like
[1:04:41] sorry stagger out my brother his sister
[1:04:48] nobody's going to just stagger into
[1:04:50] heaven but sons and daughters of God
[1:04:54] that got the Holy Ghost anointed and
[1:04:56] it's been given to them and abundant Oh
[1:04:59] hallelujah amen we can see clearly who
[1:05:03] we are we see clearly that the word has
[1:05:06] come down this is not just some debate
[1:05:08] of what this scripture means and what
[1:05:10] this scripture means this is life poured
[1:05:14] into the Bride of Christ this is
[1:05:16] revelation born into this bride and all
[1:05:19] she can see is Jesus Christ
[1:05:22] she's now walking to the world she's not
[1:05:24] walking to wealth and fame she's not
[1:05:27] walking to popularity all she sees is
[1:05:30] Jesus Christ
[1:05:32] but Satan would come when we have good
[1:05:35] days bad days we sometimes struggle he
[1:05:39] tries to say this is who you are
[1:05:41] no I'm telling you who I am when I look
[1:05:43] up and I see my Lord Jesus that's who I
[1:05:46] am because an entrance has administered
[1:05:50] not will be some day it has been
[1:05:53] ministered hallelujah the prophets spoke
[1:05:56] heed and God has anointed men to come in
[1:06:00] the hour we live in catch the revelation
[1:06:03] of what the prophets spoke and the
[1:06:06] brother branham even makes a statement
[1:06:07] he says now you know I hope you get you
[1:06:11] know just I'm paraphrasing it I hope you
[1:06:13] get what I didn't say come on why why
[1:06:18] how can he say that how can I understand
[1:06:22] what the Prophet did not say because the
[1:06:26] entrance has been being ministered day
[1:06:30] after day week after week year after
[1:06:33] year the men Ennis the entrance has been
[1:06:36] ministered to us and we come to
[1:06:39] something my brother and sister and we
[1:06:41] look at that and we're able to say you
[1:06:43] know what this is the line upon the line
[1:06:46] this is the precept upon the precept
[1:06:49] this is the word upon the word
[1:06:52] and it's all tied together I'm not gonna
[1:06:55] argue over it I'm gonna say Amen to it
[1:06:58] and I'm gonna let it minister unto me
[1:07:00] abundantly into the everlasting Kingdom
[1:07:04] I don't want just enough to get to the
[1:07:06] gate I don't want my vision as time goes
[1:07:09] on I'll tell you it's funny you talk
[1:07:11] about vision now I was working a couple
[1:07:13] days ago on some things and you know it
[1:07:16] was like okay take my glasses off and I
[1:07:19] get my face right up here about this
[1:07:21] close and then I couldn't get my face
[1:07:23] that close I put my glasses on I still
[1:07:25] can't see and I take them off I can't
[1:07:26] see it oh it's like oh it's miserable
[1:07:31] but I've got something beyond two pieces
[1:07:35] of glass that's all or plastic that they
[1:07:37] somehow made it so I can see I've got
[1:07:40] something that opened up abundantly to
[1:07:43] me and all I see now is my Lord and
[1:07:47] Savior Jesus Christ hallelujah there's
[1:07:50] no other vision of this what other
[1:07:52] vision can we have hallelujah so can we
[1:07:58] say amen to that abundant Amen I believe
[1:08:01] it's been ministered unto us abundantly
[1:08:04] all you have to do you know I find it
[1:08:06] kind of almost eerie the rising of the
[1:08:14] Sun you haven't listened to it lately
[1:08:17] listen to it it was preached yesterday
[1:08:20] you know or maybe we could say it was
[1:08:24] preached today come on it's almost eerie
[1:08:28] it's almost eerie what was preached 1965
[1:08:32] and it's I think it's more pertinent
[1:08:35] right now than it was then
[1:08:36] oh my brother and sister but this is
[1:08:39] what God was doing all these years it
[1:08:42] was all the message that was preached
[1:08:44] and all the foundation it wasn't to give
[1:08:47] us this is some little token portion
[1:08:49] this wasn't come to just give us enough
[1:08:52] that kind of give our family religion
[1:08:54] this come to give us an entrance into
[1:08:57] the presence of Almighty God hallelujah
[1:09:02] amen let's go to second Timothy 2:20
[1:09:05] amen been in a great house there's not
[1:09:15] only vessels of golden of silver but
[1:09:17] also of wood and of Earth and some to
[1:09:18] honor and some to dishonor you see my
[1:09:23] brother and sister this right here shows
[1:09:25] us very much that there is a very
[1:09:28] distinct difference not only of gold and
[1:09:32] silver and wood and of Earth but of
[1:09:35] honor and dishonor you see God has given
[1:09:38] now many people I'm afraid I read a
[1:09:42] quote the other day I shared it I
[1:09:44] believe with the church here brother I'm
[1:09:45] talking about how that people oh that
[1:09:47] would have been Wednesday night people
[1:09:49] you know the young lady I still love the
[1:09:51] Lord but I just can't live this I don't
[1:09:53] my excuse me ah the problem my brother
[1:09:58] and sister is you've got to zero in on
[1:10:00] what you are here now this is not pardon
[1:10:04] my presumption 'us but this is not us
[1:10:07] dart going I think I'll try and be oh
[1:10:09] I'm silver are you with me you know it's
[1:10:20] like a little joke man put a dart board
[1:10:23] on the wall gave his wife a dart and
[1:10:26] said wherever the dart hits it was a
[1:10:29] dart board but he had it marked he said
[1:10:31] wherever it hits is where we're going on
[1:10:32] vacation she said I guess we're spending
[1:10:35] three weeks behind the fridge
[1:10:42] come on my brother and sister this is
[1:10:44] not for us to decide on gold I hope I'm
[1:10:47] silver for the bride of Jesus Christ she
[1:10:50] needs to say you know what I am what God
[1:10:53] made me to be but I'm gonna claim that I
[1:10:55] am gold amen and if I'm not gold out
[1:10:59] definitely silver and if I owe the other
[1:11:02] parts the hard one because if I'm
[1:11:06] whipped
[1:11:07] and I'm serving God I'll be okay with
[1:11:09] that but honor and dishonor are the
[1:11:16] polar opposites you can't just say well
[1:11:19] if I'm not honored I guess I'll be all
[1:11:23] right being Dishonored no doesn't work
[1:11:26] that way you see we can take this and
[1:11:28] say you know what these might be levels
[1:11:30] of God's calling in one's life you know
[1:11:33] gold silver wood Earth whatever those
[1:11:35] could be levels it just bear with me no
[1:11:38] those could be callings in our life of
[1:11:40] what God called us to do but my
[1:11:43] brother's sister when it gets down to
[1:11:44] the honor and the dishonor my goodness
[1:11:47] he's saying nobody knows me in the whole
[1:11:50] you know body of the bride of Jesus
[1:11:52] Christ I'm not known my brother and
[1:11:54] sister that's irrelevant just be
[1:11:57] honorable amen
[1:11:59] show the honor show that Christ is alive
[1:12:02] and well amen he didn't call us to just
[1:12:05] kind of blunder along through life and
[1:12:06] whatever is is is I hear people say that
[1:12:09] all the time well God's in control and
[1:12:11] whatever I am I am well my brother and
[1:12:13] sister what about your voice and what
[1:12:15] about God saying you know what you bind
[1:12:17] on earth you can bind in heaven I am
[1:12:19] gold and I am a vessel of Honor Amen
[1:12:24] Lord forgive me for the times I would
[1:12:26] fall short of that but my cry my
[1:12:29] confession my testimony is I am a vessel
[1:12:34] of gold and I am here to honor God
[1:12:38] hallelujah now some people think I'm
[1:12:45] presumptuous maybe I am but I tell you
[1:12:49] what my brother and sister I believe
[1:12:50] God's give us the opportunity to step in
[1:12:53] to the role as a supernatural being he
[1:12:56] spoke it before the foundation of the
[1:12:58] world he opened the door he gave the
[1:12:59] gift he imparted now it's up to us
[1:13:02] whether we want to really accept that
[1:13:04] reminds me one time of a story I read
[1:13:08] about a young man when he was a kid he
[1:13:10] told his dad he said daddy I'm gonna I'm
[1:13:12] gonna be a professional baseball player
[1:13:14] and the dad side of the story was he
[1:13:17] said I saw many kids that were much more
[1:13:19] gifted could judge the ball to hit it
[1:13:23] throw straighter throw farther run
[1:13:26] faster and I thought there's no way on
[1:13:28] earth my son will ever be a professional
[1:13:31] baseball player but you know he noticed
[1:13:34] going into junior high and on into high
[1:13:37] school that his son would ask the coach
[1:13:41] can I stay in you know use the pitching
[1:13:44] machine and hit more balls and you'd
[1:13:46] find him in the backyard
[1:13:47] using a rebounder and throwing the ball
[1:13:50] and ground in it and and it seemed like
[1:13:52] it was obsessed and people started
[1:13:54] speaking to him like you know your son
[1:13:56] might be a little obsessive of this you
[1:13:59] know thing that he confesses and when he
[1:14:01] went in and finished up high school and
[1:14:03] was pretty much on par with most
[1:14:05] everybody went to a regular kind of
[1:14:07] normal school in college and by his
[1:14:11] testimony is as it was God's blessing he
[1:14:14] got a coach that was patient and
[1:14:15] encouraging and he kept telling his
[1:14:18] coach I'm gonna be a professional
[1:14:19] baseball player and the coach looked him
[1:14:22] right in the face and said ok if you're
[1:14:24] gonna be a professional this is what
[1:14:27] you've got to do oh he didn't baby him
[1:14:30] oh sure you are
[1:14:31] and he didn't cut him down and say you
[1:14:33] don't got it come on let's get this come
[1:14:37] on we're not here to put levels of your
[1:14:40] more spiritual that one's more spiritual
[1:14:42] that one's not this one's going to make
[1:14:44] it not one's not we're here this is what
[1:14:47] you got to do if you're going to make it
[1:14:50] hallelu you're gonna keep your eyes upon
[1:14:53] the goal amen in this case you got to
[1:14:55] keep your eyes on the ball I don't care
[1:14:57] if you're playing in the outfield and
[1:14:59] the ball is in the infield you keep your
[1:15:02] eyes on the ball and by the time he got
[1:15:05] halfway through
[1:15:06] College he was outstanding he was better
[1:15:09] and then the players he played with and
[1:15:12] his coach told him you need to go I
[1:15:14] believe it was in Oklahoma you need to
[1:15:16] go to to the main university because you
[1:15:20] have exceeded the level of the rest of
[1:15:22] your team and you need people to
[1:15:24] challenge you and he moved over there to
[1:15:26] that University and that coach was a
[1:15:28] tyrant and he told him if you ever think
[1:15:32] you're even going to make this team
[1:15:34] you've got to improve and he was
[1:15:38] devastated and he ran more fielded more
[1:15:43] balls hit more balls worked out in the
[1:15:46] weight room more because his coach was
[1:15:48] there what he didn't catch was the
[1:15:51] reverse of the psychology that was there
[1:15:53] and the coach saw here is someone who
[1:15:56] has something but he if you go out of
[1:16:00] college into the big leagues he's gonna
[1:16:02] make it up to another level and he
[1:16:06] didn't baby a problem is my brother and
[1:16:08] sister we like to be preached that we're
[1:16:09] all in the rapture want to be preached
[1:16:11] that we've all got all this revelation
[1:16:13] and we've got the message how about we
[1:16:16] come to a place you'd be patient enough
[1:16:17] for me to tell you you need to move up a
[1:16:20] level you need to give a little more you
[1:16:23] need to try a little harder how dare you
[1:16:26] talk to me that way posture I believe
[1:16:29] this message I've got the Holy Ghost I
[1:16:32] don't care what you got I want you to
[1:16:35] make it so bad
[1:16:36] I'm gonna goad you I'm gonna push you
[1:16:39] I'm not gonna beg you and I'm not gonna
[1:16:44] hand you a candy bar
[1:16:46] come on Saints because we might be the
[1:16:50] catalyst that causes a brother or a
[1:16:53] sister to realize there is a higher
[1:16:56] plane there is a higher calling I know
[1:17:00] my brother he's not trying to play
[1:17:02] spiritual games with us and God's moving
[1:17:05] on him I want to go where he's going I
[1:17:08] want to make the team and that young man
[1:17:12] he almost got discouraged and quit and
[1:17:15] his dad told him he says son if you quit
[1:17:20] now
[1:17:20] you're saying that your dream was a lie
[1:17:24] you talk about blunt do I say people are
[1:17:37] like well the Lord revealed to me twenty
[1:17:42] nine and a half years ago this message
[1:17:44] was real but this last summer I got to
[1:17:49] reading some Stafford doesn't appear
[1:17:55] that that revival in Africa that brother
[1:17:57] broom talked about ever come to pass it
[1:18:03] doesn't appear that this over here
[1:18:04] happened and brother Branham told the
[1:18:08] story about the same event seven
[1:18:10] different ways I've been deceived I'm
[1:18:16] done with the message well you're either
[1:18:20] lying right now
[1:18:21] or you are lying twenty nine and a half
[1:18:23] years ago some part some part you were
[1:18:27] lying
[1:18:28] oh you wonder about that revival in
[1:18:32] Africa now I don't know where they all
[1:18:36] stand I've only been to the civilized
[1:18:38] part of Africa but my brother and sister
[1:18:41] when you go to towns like Consortium and
[1:18:45] everywhere you go message believers
[1:18:48] walking the streets Sunday morning there
[1:18:53] might be somewhere close to fifty
[1:18:55] thousand believers not all in one church
[1:18:58] many churches Kinshasa has many large
[1:19:01] churches I don't know maybe maybe maybe
[1:19:05] I've got that messed up but there's a
[1:19:08] revival taking place but wherever
[1:19:13] there's two
[1:19:17] well can grace have a revival amen grace
[1:19:22] can have a revival hallelujah my brother
[1:19:25] and sisters you see we got to decide who
[1:19:28] we are and what we are hallelujah I
[1:19:32] joked with Gary
[1:19:33] she thought I was using reverse
[1:19:35] psychology I said I'm gonna preach a
[1:19:36] long time tonight
[1:19:37] she's like laughed and said oh I like it
[1:19:40] I like it thank you Lord now you see my
[1:19:46] brother and sister we have the
[1:19:47] opportunity step into being a
[1:19:49] supernatural being or we can occupy the
[1:19:52] position of I'm the downtrodden nobody
[1:19:57] likes me nobody loves me nobody
[1:19:58] understands me nobody agrees with me we
[1:20:01] can become in the position of the
[1:20:03] downtrodden you can be the defeated
[1:20:06] Christian as long as you want you can
[1:20:09] decide you know I'm just whooped on I'm
[1:20:12] beaten or whatever now I've used this
[1:20:14] reference before so please forgive me it

[1:20:33] freeway and some guy in a dually truck

[1:20:38] through the crowd amen so far as I know
[1:20:41] they haven't arrested him or anything
[1:20:42] because actually according to the law
[1:20:44] those suits stand in the middle of the
[1:20:46] highway are the ones breaking the law
[1:20:48] amen now we're not supposed to run over
[1:20:50] fellow citizens but still my brother and
[1:20:52] sister you know it's kind of a deal but
[1:20:55] the world had its Occupy Wall Street you
[1:20:57] know and they were making their
[1:20:59] statement that we're going to come and
[1:21:00] we're going to show you the
[1:21:02] anti-establishment and we're going to
[1:21:04] you know express who we are what we're
[1:21:07] doing and the authority we have but you
[1:21:10] know when I say my brother and sister

[1:21:20] Jerusalem amen let that show and let us
[1:21:23] come together and let's have our crowd
[1:21:26] let's have our deal and let's show them
[1:21:28] the authority that we've been given
[1:21:30] Amen that we could move right into a
[1:21:32] position we can occupy that position in
[1:21:35] spite of everything Satan's got to say
[1:21:38] about it we can occupy that and say this
[1:21:41] is my position amen I have been given an
[1:21:45] abundant opening into the kingdom of God
[1:21:48] amen I don't have to sit back and this
[1:21:50] hope that I will make it I'm going to
[1:21:52] start this movement and I'm claiming my
[1:21:55] spot in the New Jerusalem
[1:21:56] amen I'll tell you what my brother and
[1:21:58] sister it won't happen if somebody's
[1:22:00] going to be hungry enough they'll desire
[1:22:02] to fill that position hey man I'm gonna
[1:22:05] occupy the New Jerusalem hallelujah amen
[1:22:09] now look I want to hurry along Romans
[1:22:12] 9:22 through 26 amen what if God willing
[1:22:16] to show his wrath and to make his power
[1:22:18] known endured with much long-suffering
[1:22:20] the vessels of Wrath fitted to
[1:22:23] destruction so this whole class my
[1:22:26] brother and sister these vessels that
[1:22:28] are of dishonor that God is still being
[1:22:31] patient amen
[1:22:32] might be waiting for you and I and that
[1:22:34] he might make known the riches of his
[1:22:36] glory on the vessels of Mercy which he
[1:22:39] had afore prepared unto his glory
[1:22:43] Oh ma'am we've been prepared already my
[1:22:46] brother and sister even us whom he hath
[1:22:49] called not of the Jews only but also of
[1:22:52] the Gentiles as he said also in Oh see I
[1:22:55] will call them my people which were not
[1:22:57] my people and her beloved which was not
[1:23:00] beloved and it shall come to pass that
[1:23:02] in the place where it was said unto them
[1:23:03] you know not my people there shall they
[1:23:07] be called the children of the Living God
[1:23:10] hallelujah God is opening this up to us
[1:23:14] right now my brother and sister the
[1:23:17] people God is patient with these people
[1:23:20] but the wrath amen the cup of iniquity
[1:23:22] in my mind it's got to be already
[1:23:25] overflowing I don't know I've quit
[1:23:28] trying to decide whether it's the days
[1:23:30] of Sodom or not it might go on another
[1:23:32] 10 years I cannot even fathom what that
[1:23:35] will be like but my brother and sister
[1:23:38] I'm pretty sure this Sodom was pretty
[1:23:40] wicked amen it wasn't just a walk in the
[1:23:43] dark when people start trying to
[1:23:44] bash your door down to molest the guests
[1:23:47] in your house
[1:23:53] come on
[1:23:55] pretty wicked let's see we're coming to
[1:24:00] this time jumping back to our original
[1:24:03] Scripture but as many as received him to
[1:24:06] them gave he power to become sons of God
[1:24:10] amen the word is telling us that there
[1:24:14] is power that has already been released
[1:24:17] and there is power that is being
[1:24:20] released right now hey man we're not
[1:24:22] sitting here with a powerless message
[1:24:24] we're not sitting here with a dead
[1:24:26] message we're not sitting here looking
[1:24:28] back my brother and sister I love to
[1:24:30] read I said sometimes in my chair I get
[1:24:33] tears in my eyes my heart just just
[1:24:35] palette eights you know just I just like
[1:24:37] oh my what that would be when you read
[1:24:40] or hear these things of the prophet of
[1:24:42] God dealing with spirits and dealing
[1:24:44] with people giving deliverance to them
[1:24:46] talking about relatives that are not
[1:24:48] even there and just as it was in the
[1:24:50] scripture basically telling them go home
[1:24:53] they have been healed in the name of
[1:24:55] Jesus Christ all my brother and sister
[1:24:58] that publican that man when he come to
[1:25:00] Jesus and he believed and he went and
[1:25:02] started home and one from his house meet
[1:25:05] him and says your child lives my brother
[1:25:07] and sister he believed and his household
[1:25:10] believed and there was something
[1:25:12] supernatural took place come on we don't
[1:25:17] want to sit back yes and we believe this
[1:25:18] message yes daughter we believe this
[1:25:20] message put it on display
[1:25:22] let it be living let the word come that
[1:25:25] there is power in house of God there is
[1:25:28] power in sons and daughters of God
[1:25:35] reminds me of a story I read recently
[1:25:39] about a man I don't know what become of
[1:25:42] it but he was a read a book on day
[1:25:45] trading and he obviously had a lot more
[1:25:48] money than you and I cuz he had like had
[1:25:50] luck up there and there's seven-figure
[1:25:52] money to start with and he started day
[1:25:54] trading and he made a series obviously
[1:25:57] didn't
[1:25:58] understand what he was doing he made a
[1:26:00] series of decisions and when they went
[1:26:04] backwards the Wall Street deal or
[1:26:08] whatever come to him and I don't
[1:26:09] remember the number I don't want to
[1:26:10] exaggerate to you but it was scary they
[1:26:13] come back to him said you owe us 11
[1:26:14] million dollars
[1:26:16] I'm not worth 11 million dollars that's
[1:26:18] your problem
[1:26:20] you owe us I'll have a million dollars
[1:26:23] my brother and sister you see we've been
[1:26:25] given a book we don't have to speculate
[1:26:28] are you with me we don't got to
[1:26:30] speculate what it's going to take to
[1:26:31] make a rapture amen we've got the
[1:26:34] preparation of the inner man we've come
[1:26:36] to the place my brother and sister we
[1:26:38] have everything we need to become our
[1:26:40] calling we have everything and we don't
[1:26:43] need an excuse
[1:26:44] well well are our children or teenagers
[1:26:46] good what a wonderful time to introduce
[1:26:48] them to the power of Almighty God that
[1:26:50] God can see it alive in our church that
[1:26:52] God can see it alive in our home see it
[1:26:55] mom and dad see it and brothers and
[1:26:57] sisters see it there what a wonderful
[1:26:59] time for them at the Lord tarries to be
[1:27:01] able to go on and say as a young person
[1:27:03] I met Jesus Christ he's alive he's well
[1:27:06] he said he would do it and he does it
[1:27:10] hallelujah we don't have to sit back and
[1:27:12] say I just hope I just hope how about
[1:27:14] some confidence amen Oh hallelujah well
[1:27:18] look I'm gonna disclose right here you
[1:27:20] see there's a power that's being
[1:27:22] released you know we've heard and we've
[1:27:29] preached about the powers of darkness
[1:27:30] and certainly Satan is a force to be
[1:27:32] dealt with but what the word say said we
[1:27:37] would vanquish every enemy not just some
[1:27:41] of them not just the easy ones every
[1:27:45] enemy come on my brother and sister
[1:27:48] every enemy vanquish means to defeat
[1:27:52] thoroughly hallelujah not call a truce
[1:27:56] with them oh look there's power that's
[1:27:59] being released do you know what the
[1:28:01] greatest powers that I see is that
[1:28:03] people are struggling with in this hour
[1:28:05] right now there's the power of
[1:28:06] repentance amen
[1:28:09] if we're not careful we'll carry things
[1:28:12] because it's hard to say Lord forgive me
[1:28:14] it's hard to say brother-sister husband
[1:28:16] wife children come on my brother and
[1:28:21] sister a power to keep us from sinning
[1:28:26] it's here we don't have to be like the
[1:28:30] the the waves tossed to and fro amen
[1:28:36] I was watching a little video clip of a
[1:28:40] boat out I believe it was maybe our
[1:28:42] story Oregon and the caption says on
[1:28:49] that day that there was high surf
[1:28:50] warnings and recommendation the boats
[1:28:52] don't leave the harbor but these guys
[1:28:55] were determined to leave the harbor and
[1:28:57] as they started to plow out there my
[1:29:00] brother and sister they didn't even
[1:29:03] hardly make it out of the harbor gate
[1:29:05] and they were on the radio Mayday Mayday
[1:29:08] we're sinking
[1:29:11] all they had to do is stop heed the
[1:29:16] warning the name of the Lord is a strong
[1:29:24] tower the righteous run in - and they
[1:29:31] are say Oh hallelujah all they had to do
[1:29:38] is heed the warning that says small
[1:29:42] boats don't leave the harbour my brother
[1:29:47] and sister we have the power to become
[1:29:53] our calling we don't have to sit here
[1:29:58] and hope we don't have to sit here and
[1:30:01] guess we don't have to sit here now this
[1:30:05] is probably going to throw somebody you
[1:30:07] don't have to sit here and pray are you
[1:30:13] with me don't wanna I don't want to trip
[1:30:16] you God's already given it he's already
[1:30:20] promised already explained to us what
[1:30:23] would happen we
[1:30:25] don't even have to if you follow what
[1:30:27] I'm saying you don't even have to pray
[1:30:29] oh lord please please please
[1:30:31] he's already gave it to you receive what
[1:30:34] he has already given to us hey man I
[1:30:39] don't want anybody be confused or you'll
[1:30:41] understand it when I was saying Amen but
[1:30:43] people are like Oh Lord play I want I
[1:30:46] want oh please help me look no my
[1:30:48] brother and sister it's time just what
[1:30:50] the Prophet said about healing Amen if
[1:30:53] he was even right here he couldn't do
[1:30:55] one thing more because he's already
[1:30:57] healed you hey man he's already given
[1:31:00] his word and revealed it into the Bride
[1:31:03] of Christ you say how can you say that
[1:31:05] brother Paul because the prophet of God
[1:31:07] said everything this is a paraphrase
[1:31:09] everything you need for the rapture is
[1:31:13] already in you amen you don't got to run
[1:31:17] off somewhere and find it we don't gotta
[1:31:19] find somebody you know that's down there
[1:31:21] we got a man down here you know in
[1:31:24] Puerto Rico that you know claims that
[1:31:27] he's now the incarnation or whatever the
[1:31:29] last revealed word it he's got 17 or 18
[1:31:32] thousand people that are following him
[1:31:34] down there they have all kinds of issues
[1:31:36] everything from child abuse to sexual
[1:31:38] abuse and this is the revealed word of
[1:31:40] the hour my brother and sister that's
[1:31:42] not the revealed word of the hour
[1:31:43] that's a man who's trying to say you got
[1:31:45] to look to me to get to God my brother
[1:31:48] and sister the word has been opened it's
[1:31:51] been given come on it's been given my
[1:31:55] brother and sister it's time for us to
[1:31:58] take the preparation that God has been
[1:32:00] giving us and stand upon that and say
[1:32:03] you know what this is what the word said
[1:32:05] I just simply believe it I might not
[1:32:07] even be able to tie it all together I
[1:32:09] might be able to explain it people say
[1:32:11] well that's a nonsense is it I fly on an
[1:32:15] airplane every once in a while you can
[1:32:19] explain the dynamics of how wing works
[1:32:22] right right you all understand how wing
[1:32:26] works amen the wind beneath my wings no
[1:32:35] the song wouldn't be the same if it said
[1:32:37] the vacuum above my wings
[1:32:42] come on my brother and sister we've got
[1:32:46] the word step out and become your
[1:32:51] calling amen
[1:32:54] how do you do that brother Paul just
[1:32:56] line upon line precept upon precept word
[1:33:00] upon word hallelujah
[1:33:04] we're not going to have some special
[1:33:05] flash you're not gonna you know get up
[1:33:07] in the morning and there'll be a flash
[1:33:09] and suddenly you have revelation you see
[1:33:12] God's working how does that song go you
[1:33:17] know help me sister Emmie why don't you
[1:33:18] come and then that'll get me to stop
[1:33:20] preaching the word is working mightily
[1:33:25] in my church I love that song the word
[1:33:32] is working mightily in the ministry
[1:33:38] hallelujah it's working mightily in me
[1:33:43] amen that's how we become our calling
[1:33:47] let the word loose amen
[1:33:52] okay well we made it off the first page
[1:33:55] in that wonderful amen
[1:33:58] you know Philippians 2:15 16 says that
[1:34:02] you may be blameless and harmless the
[1:34:05] sons of God without rebuke in the midst
[1:34:08] of a crooked and perverse nation I'm
[1:34:11] surprised they didn't put United States
[1:34:13] in there among whom you shine as lights
[1:34:18] in the world holding forth oh I hope you
[1:34:22] catch this what are we holding forth I'm
[1:34:25] a message believer know my brother and
[1:34:28] sister
[1:34:30] the word of life you see there's that
[1:34:35] whole troubling thing guy who won't
[1:34:38] darken the door of a church says I'm a
[1:34:40] message believer and says say only what
[1:34:45] the Prophet said
[1:34:47] [Music]
[1:34:51] find you good Holy Ghost filled Church
[1:34:57] go to church be found faithful at your
[1:35:00] post of duty
[1:35:02] that's not word for word but that's what
[1:35:06] he said
[1:35:12] hypocrites at church
[1:35:14] [Music]
[1:35:17] I've done some extensive research
[1:35:21] everywhere I go I find Hippocrates but
[1:35:27] the only ones that are important are the
[1:35:29] ones at church because we can rub
[1:35:33] shoulders with all the rest of them
[1:35:36] because you realize that they held that
[1:35:38] same axiom they'd never go to a grocery
[1:35:41] store and they'd never go to a gas
[1:35:43] station never the bank come on I'm being
[1:35:51] humorous but I want you to catch the
[1:35:53] reality of this you see Saints holding
[1:35:58] forth of life that I may rejoice in the
[1:36:01] day of Christ that I have not run in
[1:36:03] vain neither labored in vain you see the
[1:36:10] Word of God cannot return void can I say
[1:36:14] that louder the Word of God can not
[1:36:19] return void now there's always two sides
[1:36:23] to every coin my daddy taught me when I
[1:36:24] was a child he says son there's three
[1:36:27] sides to every story everybody says
[1:36:29] they're suicides they're story two sides
[1:36:31] to every story but I wish you hadn't
[1:36:33] taught me this it's caused me a lot of
[1:36:34] grief in my life he says son they're
[1:36:38] right but they're wrong because there's
[1:36:39] three sides to every story
[1:36:41] their side and their side and the
[1:36:44] absolute truth
[1:36:47] let's not shoot for their side or our
[1:36:49] side or someone else's sign let's shoot
[1:36:52] for the absolute truth hallelujah let's
[1:36:55] just stand praise the Lord brother Jason
[1:36:57] come hallelu you got a little bit more
[1:37:00] pure but I think it's maybe just a tad
[1:37:01] bit redundant amen
[1:37:04] can I read the quote real quick I just
[1:37:07] had one closing quote hey man Jesus on
[1:37:09] the authority of the word well that's a
[1:37:12] title isn't it
[1:37:13] amen you see what I mean others we could
[1:37:17] refer to but people Christianity and the
[1:37:20] way they have it today is so shallow
[1:37:23] no wonder the unbeliever can hardly see
[1:37:26] how to believe Christianity because it's
[1:37:28] no more than a form but Christianity is
[1:37:33] real in its power and if it's just
[1:37:35] ceremonial any other any other ceremony
[1:37:39] would take its place now my brother said
[1:37:43] please don't misunderstand me I've
[1:37:46] shared with you my friend they tried to
[1:37:48] talk me into draggin you guys all off
[1:37:51] some other direction and my pledge that
[1:37:55] I made to him that if I sigh and find
[1:37:58] something better than the message I'm
[1:38:00] gone
[1:38:01] [Music]
[1:38:03] don't get nervous don't get nervous
[1:38:08] amen because it's not until I find
[1:38:11] something better and better would mean
[1:38:14] closer to God hmm are you with me
[1:38:17] amen but look if it's just ceremonial
[1:38:20] any other ceremony would take its place
[1:38:28] I have nothing against lodges masonry
[1:38:32] Oddfellows any of them would be just as
[1:38:34] well if its ceremony it has it's good
[1:38:37] and bad just like the church but
[1:38:38] Christianity is a living being in man
[1:38:43] kind hallelujah and the Word was made
[1:38:48] flesh and dwelt among us Oh hallelujah
