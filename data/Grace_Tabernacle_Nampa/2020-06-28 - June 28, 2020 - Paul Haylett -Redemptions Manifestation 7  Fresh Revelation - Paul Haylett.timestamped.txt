[29:12] couple I see All Saints greeting some

[29:25] me on the spot he says really have a

[29:29] vacation actually it's too much pressure
[29:31] he says what do you think I go through
[29:32] when I go to Oregon so I said I can't
[29:37] let him come to Oregon and say that he's
[29:40] under pressure he cannot sing
[29:43] so I chose the song follow me and
[29:47] there's two lines out of the songs that
[29:49] spoke to me sometime back and it's if
[29:52] just a cup of water I've placed it in
[29:55] your hand then it's all adjust a cup of
[29:57] water it's all that I demand I want you
[30:01] to encourage every one of you to just
[30:03] give your best and what Jesus gives you
[30:05] is what you can give and it's not
[30:08] anymore you don't have to give more it's
[30:10] just that and I just want to ask you to
[30:14] keep that in mind that the Lord may
[30:15] bless you
[30:24] I've traveled down a lonely road and no
[30:29] one seems to care the burden of my way
[30:34] reback had bowed me to despair by off
[30:39] the plate to Jesus our folks were
[30:43] treating me and when I heard him say so
[30:47] Ted
[30:49] [Music]
[30:50] [Applause]
[30:53] my neighbor also weary upon that Capri
[30:58] broke that cross became so heavy I fell
[31:04] beneath alone be faithful weary Bella
[31:09] where the morning I can see dust if your
[31:15] cross and follow close to me I worked so
[31:23] hard for Jesus
[31:25] I often instance a I've sacrificed a lot
[31:30] of things to walk the narrow way my kpop
[31:36] fame and fortune I'm worth the lot to me
[31:40] and made I heard him say so tenderly
[31:48] I left a throne of glory and counted it
[31:54] back loss
[31:55] my hands were nailing anger upon that
[32:00] cruel cross but now we'll make the
[32:04] journey with your hands safe in mine so
[32:10] lift your cross and follow me
[32:15] [Applause]
[32:15] [Music]
[32:18] Jesus if I die upon a foreign field
[32:22] Sunday would be no more than love of the
[32:27] man no less could I repay no greater
[32:31] love has poured a man that for a friend
[32:35] to die these are the words he gently
[32:39] said
[32:44] if just a cup of water
[32:48] I placed within your hand then just a
[32:53] cup of water is all that I demand but if
[32:59] my fatally being by glory I can see I'll
[33:05] take my cross and follow close to being
[33:11] will be the last part if just a cup of
[33:15] water I placed within your head
[33:20] then just a cup of water is all
[33:27] all that I need mint but if by death to
[33:32] living they can like glory see I'll take
[33:38] my cross and follow close to be and
[33:52] that's so true it's just a cup of water

[45:12] manifestation of redemption it was not
[45:15] just hey I'm gonna do something but he
[45:18] said I'm gonna bring in evidence that
[45:20] this is happening I'm gonna bring forth
[45:21] an evidence that Redemption has come to
[45:25] my people and that my people have been
[45:27] truly set free and so we look at this I
[45:30] want to speak to you this morning
[45:32] fresh revelation and that would be kind
[45:36] of a something that can be taken several
[45:39] different ways it just would be up to
[45:41] the person who is hearing it in what way
[45:44] they want to take it I would like for
[45:46] you to turn to first Corinthians a
[45:49] second chapter and we'll start with the
[45:52] first verse today just want to dig in
[45:56] it's lovely did you enjoy the specials
[45:58] now my brother and sister I think now I
[46:01] won't go into it and take the time to
[46:03] explain everything but see I think every
[46:05] one of those special
[46:06] was anointed because just things I'm
[46:09] seeing things I'm looking into things
[46:12] that dealing with you might say in my
[46:14] own life and and with phone calls etc
[46:17] that you just realized God is mindful
[46:20] and sometimes he comes down and he just
[46:22] speaks a little word to you to remind
[46:25] you I know who you are and I know what
[46:28] your situation is and I hear your cry
[46:32] and I am answering your prayer and truly
[46:36] the hearts desire of every son and
[46:38] daughter of God is we talk about it in
[46:41] this fashion we say well I want to make
[46:42] a rapture but really the underlying
[46:44] effect of making the rapture my brother
[46:47] and sister is not just to make a rapture
[46:49] that's like going to an event you might
[46:52] say but truly it is our hearts desire
[46:54] being drawn into the presence of
[46:57] Almighty God God set forth the avenue
[47:00] we'll travel that Avenue and walk
[47:02] faithfully in that and to his presence
[47:05] and I'm thankful that through the
[47:07] singing of song through praise and
[47:09] worship it encourages the soul to to
[47:12] give us a clear vision of what it is you
[47:15] know sometimes brother Brown talks about
[47:18] that the old eagle I can get a little
[47:20] clouded over but what we want is for the
[47:23] word to come amen now look when you
[47:26] think about that thought when that eagle
[47:29] I got clouded over there was something
[47:31] anointed the eagle and when that when
[47:35] that old beat got to the overgrown he
[47:37] had a choice he had a choice to make and
[47:40] that would be that he could go to that
[47:42] place in the mountains and he could sit
[47:44] there until he died and there was
[47:47] evidence amongst the bones and feathers
[47:49] that there were other eagles who did not
[47:52] overcome that trial of their life but
[47:57] the real believer amen was anointed and
[48:02] other believers stood with them they
[48:05] didn't say oh look at that their eyes
[48:06] filmed over their beak is overgrown no
[48:09] for know what did they do they took and
[48:11] they carried the very meat of the word
[48:13] and reminded them your sons your
[48:16] daughters and they laid it down in
[48:19] front of them Oh can't you see I'm going
[48:22] through a trial leave me alone no I'm
[48:25] sorry not gonna happen we're Eagles for
[48:28] Eagles we're going to carry the word to
[48:30] you and we're going to lay it right down
[48:31] in front of you and then you have to
[48:35] decide whether you're going to pick it
[48:36] up or not and if you pick it up it gives
[48:39] strength in that body and now this might
[48:41] sound a little coarse to some people but
[48:44] my brother and sister if you love the
[48:46] taste of blood now if you understand
[48:49] what I'm saying is if you cannot live
[48:52] without the bloody word of god if you
[48:57] love the taste of blood when that Eagle
[49:01] took a bite of that morsel laid in front
[49:03] of them it reminded them of a better day
[49:06] gone by and a promise for a brighter
[49:09] future and then the eagle finds a rock
[49:12] Oh aren't you glad we got a rock Eagle
[49:16] finds a rock and starts beating his head
[49:20] upon the rock and then that all
[49:24] overgrown trial of life weary in
[49:27] well-doing those struggles of yesterday
[49:30] start chipping away and pretty soon it
[49:33] breaks loose and that eagle has a
[49:36] revival and recognizes that now I hope
[49:40] you can take this now there is almost an
[49:43] unlimited amount of time I can live they
[49:48] can't really document the age on eagles
[49:50] but they have eagles they believe lived
[49:51] a hundred and fifty years there was an
[49:54] eagle that was a broken swing many years
[49:56] ago they believed was alive this has
[49:59] been back quite a few years I was a
[50:00] young man but scientists believe that
[50:05] Eagle may well been alive at the signing
[50:09] of the Declaration of Independence but I
[50:15] got a promise as an eagle I don't have a
[50:18] time line
[50:19] I'm eternal
[50:21] I'm eternal hallelujah but I won't make
[50:25] it there if I don't beat my beak on the
[50:26] rock and get back to eating the fresh
[50:29] Word of God again amen it's all about
[50:32] the fresh word my brother and sister the
[50:34] eagle is not a buzzard even though some
[50:37] were in science someone you know called
[50:40] him a eagle Buzzard
[50:42] there's some king of the buzzards it's
[50:44] an eagle Buzzard down South America I
[50:46] thought no that's oxime or eagle is not
[50:50] a buzzard and a buzzard is not an eagle
[50:53] hallelujah first Corinthians the second
[50:56] chapter and I brethren when I come to
[51:00] you come not with excellency of speech
[51:02] or of wisdom declaring unto you the
[51:05] testimony of God for I determined not to
[51:08] know anything among you save Jesus
[51:09] Christ and him crucified and I was with
[51:13] you in weakness and in fear and in much
[51:17] trembling and my speech you know I'm
[51:21] just gonna have to say this I probably
[51:23] shouldn't but my brother and sister I
[51:25] have a hard time relating to the
[51:26] minister to the preacher to the
[51:28] individual that never had a trial never
[51:32] struggle this always been the overcomer
[51:34] has always had the revelation has always
[51:37] been this and you poor folks now I'm
[51:41] sorry I day to him I don't believe them
[51:44] I'd rather let you know that I strut
[51:47] like you strong
[51:48] that I am weak I tremble I have fear
[51:51] I've had my doubts but by God's grace
[51:54] amen by God's grace we rise above that
[51:58] not because we sit in a church with some
[52:01] awesome awesome super possum preacher
[52:05] but we serve an awesome God hallelujah
[52:09] and my speech and my preaching was not
[52:14] with enticing words of man's wisdom but
[52:16] in demonstration of the Spirit and of
[52:18] power that your faith should not stand
[52:20] in the wisdom of men now remember we
[52:23] went through this the other day faith
[52:25] would equate confidence trust amen so
[52:29] your trust should not stand in the
[52:32] wisdom of men amen
[52:37] but in the power of God
[52:39] howbeit we speak wisdom among them that
[52:41] are perfect not the wisdom of this world
[52:44] nor of the princes of this world that
[52:46] come to nought but we speak the wisdom
[52:48] of God in a mystery even the hidden
[52:51] wisdom which God ordained before the
[52:54] world unto our glory which none of the
[52:57] princes of this world knew for had they
[52:59] known it they would not have crucified
[53:01] the Lord of glory but as it is written
[53:04] eye hath not seen nor ear heard neither
[53:07] have entered into the heart of man the
[53:09] things which God hath prepared for them
[53:11] that love him but God hath revealed them
[53:15] unto us by his Spirit oh my real
[53:19] motivation to actually get into the
[53:21] Spirit of God amen because we pray for
[53:24] revelation if I can imply this to you
[53:26] this morning we pray for revelation and
[53:29] what does God do he doesn't go over here
[53:31] and just start opening a book or pages
[53:32] to us God takes us over here and causes
[53:35] us to get into the spirit he brings us
[53:38] to a place in our life that we get in
[53:40] the spirit why because God is bound you
[53:43] might say by his own word amen he cannot
[53:45] say one thing and do another and so for
[53:48] yet he has to be obedient that you might
[53:51] say to his own word and he's come here
[53:53] and told us now he hath revealed them
[53:56] unto us these mysteries right he's
[53:58] revealed them to us by his spirit so
[54:01] you've got to get in this spirit he
[54:02] doesn't say go to seminary become an
[54:04] intellectual learn Hebrew learn Greek he
[54:07] said get into the spirit for the spirit
[54:11] searcheth all things yea the deep things
[54:13] of God for what man knows the things of
[54:16] a man save the spirit of Man which is in
[54:19] him even so the things of God knoweth no
[54:21] man but the Spirit of God now we have
[54:25] received not the spirit of the world but
[54:28] the Spirit which is of God that we might
[54:30] know the things that are freely given to
[54:33] us of God I want to drive that scripture
[54:36] home now we have received not the spirit
[54:40] of the world now my brother and sister
[54:43] if we're talking Christians the spirit
[54:45] of the world might not be worldly
[54:47] us but the spirit of the world the
[54:50] intellectualism it can be that knowledge
[54:54] is power now I believe knowledge is
[54:55] power my brother and sister you you need
[54:58] to know what you're doing you know even
[54:59] driving a car you know you need to know
[55:02] what you're doing else you're gonna
[55:04] crash so having knowledge on how to
[55:06] drive the car is power but my brother
[55:08] and sister a Christian is not relying on
[55:11] the wisdom of men as the scripture has
[55:13] said it's not relying on what the world
[55:16] says would be the evidence of the Holy
[55:19] Ghost it's not relying on what the
[55:21] church says you must do if you're going
[55:23] to make it in a rapture because we have
[55:27] all kinds of sayings in the churches of
[55:29] what it takes to serve God some say it's
[55:32] as simple as picking up your BIC and
[55:34] signing your name well hallelujah it
[55:39] don't get any simpler than that go ahead
[55:42] sign your name if you want but we're
[55:44] gonna look for something greater
[55:48] hmm my I feel like preaching I think
[55:54] that's what I supposed to be here doing
[55:55] this more is it yes freely given to us
[55:59] of God which things also we speak not in
[56:01] the words which man's wisdom teaches but
[56:04] which the Holy Ghost teacheth comparing
[56:06] spiritual things with spiritual but the
[56:09] natural man receiveth not the things of
[56:11] the Spirit of God for they are
[56:13] foolishness unto Him neither can he know
[56:16] them because they are spiritually
[56:18] discerned
[56:19] but he that is spiritual judgeth all
[56:22] things yet he himself is judged of no
[56:24] man now some people would say that and
[56:26] say well praise the Lord
[56:27] nobody's going to judge me note my
[56:29] brother and sister it's telling us here
[56:31] that our judge is not man but it's
[56:34] acknowledged that it is gone Alleluia we
[56:37] will be judged amen
[56:39] there'll be no man passed from this life
[56:41] from this earth that is not judged it
[56:44] just won't be man that judges the Bride
[56:47] of Christ amen for who knoweth the mind
[56:50] of God that he may instruct him but we
[56:54] have the mind of Christ Heavenly Father
[56:57] we thank you today for your grace your
[56:59] mercy your guiding hand
[57:00] Lord we thank you even though sometimes
[57:02] father it's hard to see it
[57:04] we even thank you today for the trial so
[57:07] we thank you for the times Lord that we
[57:10] feel as it is put down distressed
[57:13] overburdened father but Lord to see the
[57:16] Sun rising in the morning father to see
[57:19] you coming on the scene fresh again for
[57:22] us today
[57:23] Lord how it moves our hearts moves our
[57:26] souls Lord to know that we stand here
[57:28] today father by your mercy and by your
[57:31] grace but also by your spoken word
[57:33] father that said that be the overcomer
[57:37] of the day now Lord we believe that and
[57:39] Lord we want our lives to reflect that
[57:42] in the name of Jesus Christ amen you may
[57:45] be seated Saints hallelujah
[57:57] amen can somebody say praise the Lord
[57:59] hallelujah amen you know as Paul was
[58:03] speaking to the Corinthians I always
[58:05] marvel at this scripture that he says I
[58:08] came not with excellency of speech or of
[58:11] wisdom declaring unto you the testimony
[58:13] of God see he never tried to take a
[58:16] superior approach to the people Paul as
[58:21] we can look through this scripture he
[58:23] come and you know declared that he would
[58:26] be all things to all people and in that
[58:28] my brother and sister that doesn't mean
[58:30] he went out and behaved like them and
[58:32] what he could speak in intellectual
[58:35] fashion if necessary always reminds me
[58:38] of our brother Mike stroke off his book
[58:41] you know and I I just found that we were
[58:43] cleaning out a bookcase and brother Mark
[58:46] I mean and I was cleaning out a bookcase
[58:48] and and there's my bookmark just about
[58:50] halfway through the book and that's how
[58:51] far I made it because I got tired of
[58:53] looking through the dictionary while I
[58:55] was reading his book because he uses
[58:57] words I've never even heard of but you
[58:59] see he wasn't speaking it to the common
[59:01] man or believer he actually wrote the
[59:04] book or the intent of the intellectual
[59:06] to be able to read that and in their
[59:09] realm where their mind went where they
[59:11] dwell it would be a perfect
[59:13] understanding and he read it wrote that
[59:16] I mean that they might read it and and
[59:18] not have an excuse or not be able to
[59:20] look down and say well it's the ignorant
[59:22] and the unlearned that serve God my
[59:24] brother and sister the Apostle Paul was
[59:27] very smart man we can see as it was
[59:29] through history and he could have base
[59:31] himself and speak to the uneducated he
[59:34] could speak to the working man the
[59:36] middle class he could speak to the
[59:37] educated the priest whoever it might be
[59:40] and so he was able to come in such a
[59:42] fashion that God anointed him to be able
[59:45] to reach out and to to speak in that
[59:48] realm and so we look today that the Word
[59:51] of God my brother and sisters some
[59:52] people would take it they think if
[59:54] someone's really smart you know those
[59:56] that are above average intelligence that
[59:59] you know hey the scripture says they're
[1:00:01] going to have a hard time making it my
[1:00:03] brother and sister that is not what the
[1:00:05] scripture was meaning it is those people
[1:00:07] who have come and believed by theirs
[1:00:09] pure intellect that they're above things
[1:00:12] amen so you can have a very high IQ and
[1:00:14] have as it were a simple faith in Jesus
[1:00:17] Christ and be blessed by the Word of God
[1:00:20] amen
[1:00:21] so you know he says I determined not to
[1:00:23] know anything among you save Jesus
[1:00:25] Christ and him crucified
[1:00:26] now I'm not interpreting nobody
[1:00:28] misunderstand me I'm not interpreting
[1:00:30] what this is saying this is a thought
[1:00:31] that come to me and I thought you know I
[1:00:33] determined not to know anything and you
[1:00:36] know my brother and sister as a pastor
[1:00:38] as a minister I talked to some too much
[1:00:41] sometimes but the older I get the more I
[1:00:43] like to just sit and listen I like to
[1:00:46] just try to understand where it's coming
[1:00:50] where it's coming from
[1:00:51] and you know it's one thing to preach to
[1:00:53] a church you know you know if you knew
[1:00:56] that this family is having a problem and
[1:00:58] you know I'm not talking about preaching
[1:01:00] at them I'm talking about preaching to
[1:01:02] them and you know a family's having a
[1:01:04] problem and you want to buy you know
[1:01:07] this burning desire in your heart you
[1:01:08] want to help them and so by God's grace
[1:01:10] you are able to preach to them in such a
[1:01:13] way that they might realize we have a
[1:01:15] situation and that is the solution but
[1:01:18] my brother and sister while that is
[1:01:20] wonderful right we can look out that's a
[1:01:21] pastor's job right that's a ministry's
[1:01:24] job is to look out amongst the church
[1:01:26] amongst the saints and to deal with the
[1:01:28] issues that are there now some people
[1:01:31] would say well we don't like that
[1:01:33] because it feels like we're being
[1:01:34] preached to well you wouldn't have liked
[1:01:36] any one of God's messengers through the
[1:01:38] ages because they would preach to you
[1:01:41] Amen people want some ambiguous kind of
[1:01:43] message that they can digest in a very
[1:01:46] simple format and move on and we'll you
[1:01:49] know read dr. Dobson to answer our
[1:01:51] questions no my brother's sister that's
[1:01:54] what the preaching of the word is for is
[1:01:56] to answer our questions amen
[1:01:59] so it's one thing for the pastor of the
[1:02:00] minister to speak in a fashion like that
[1:02:02] to something that might be a little
[1:02:04] obvious or people might say well you
[1:02:06] know he's preaching out about that but
[1:02:08] he knows all about that well my brother
[1:02:10] and sister I found nowhere in the word
[1:02:11] that says you can't preach about it
[1:02:13] because you know about it amen but I'll
[1:02:16] tell you how much more it is Saints when
[1:02:19] God would anoint a minister and he's
[1:02:23] reaching totally as it were blind to
[1:02:25] what is happening in the world around
[1:02:27] him how much more so when the word comes
[1:02:30] to you and I and deals with things in
[1:02:33] our lives that no one knows about but
[1:02:37] you and Almighty God
[1:02:38] now how much greater the Holy Spirit
[1:02:41] moving in our myths discerning the
[1:02:44] spirits is earning the situation and
[1:02:46] saying I'm going to answer your prayer
[1:02:49] I'm going to answer your need your cry
[1:02:52] but you know if we're not careful the
[1:02:54] devil will come in and people get an
[1:02:56] idea he's preaching at me well my
[1:02:58] brother and sister if he was preaching
[1:03:00] at you you know sometimes I just I don't
[1:03:03] like this and I'm just venting for a
[1:03:05] moment okay turn the fans on get all the
[1:03:07] exhaust out of here I'm venting why is
[1:03:10] it that people think the preacher has
[1:03:12] always got some kind of a axe to grind
[1:03:16] with the people anointing of the devil
[1:03:22] amen any other suggestions amen I think
[1:03:26] we'll stick with that one right there
[1:03:27] because it's spot on my brother and
[1:03:30] sister why do people think hmm that was
[1:03:35] pointed at me well there must be
[1:03:38] something there or else you would say I
[1:03:41] don't know who he's preaching to but God
[1:03:43] help them so the very fact that people
[1:03:48] rise up and push back the preachers
[1:03:50] preaching at me shows there something
[1:03:53] there that needs dealt with but it's
[1:03:57] easier to say well he's a mean
[1:03:59] vindictive man well hallelujah my how
[1:04:09] much more to preach on the things and
[1:04:12] let it be led of the Holy Ghost not the
[1:04:17] word how preeminence in us that the word
[1:04:23] would we say lord please hear my I
[1:04:25] answer my prayer Lord and then he
[1:04:27] answers it and we're like mad at
[1:04:28] somebody come on why don't we say you
[1:04:32] know what Lord you know the old phrase
[1:04:34] if the shoe fits Lord let
[1:04:36] where it if I need to pray more Lord let
[1:04:40] me pray more if I need to repent
[1:04:42] let me repent Lord if I need to whatever
[1:04:44] it might be Lord just let me do it
[1:04:47] hey man nothing to be ashamed of look
[1:04:51] sister Jerry not to put her on the spot
[1:04:53] but she pointed out to me the other day
[1:04:55] and a certain tape brother branham's
[1:04:57] talking and brother branham calls out
[1:04:58] and says yeah brother so-and-so you know
[1:05:00] he committed adultery oh my we did that
[1:05:03] in our churches this day and age people
[1:05:05] would they would boycott the church they
[1:05:08] would have a adulterers lives matter'
[1:05:10] a meeting in the parking lot and they
[1:05:13] would boycott the church because how
[1:05:15] dare they say my name over pulpit but my
[1:05:19] brother and sister you come to the place
[1:05:21] where the Holy Spirit is moving and God
[1:05:23] is earning hearts and that man was like
[1:05:26] praise the Lord
[1:05:27] he wasn't yeah I would alter and now I'm
[1:05:29] ashamed he said I was an adulterer and
[1:05:31] now I'm free hallelujah see a whole
[1:05:35] difference of the moving of the Holy
[1:05:36] Spirit amen and what it's doing in men's
[1:05:39] lives no we don't make a habit of
[1:05:41] calling adulterers out over the pulpit
[1:05:43] but my brother and sister if God did
[1:05:45] instead of rebelling against that let
[1:05:48] your heart be broken down and say Lord
[1:05:49] he really wasn't talking to me because
[1:05:52] I've already repented amen hallelujah it
[1:05:57] might be anything you might be a thief
[1:05:58] or a liar or whatever he's not talking
[1:06:01] to me I've already repented amen
[1:06:04] hallelujah amen you know going down to
[1:06:07] verse five it says that your faith your
[1:06:09] trust your confidence Amen that your
[1:06:12] faith should not stand in the wisdom of
[1:06:13] men but in the power of God now my
[1:06:16] brother and sister just as many men get
[1:06:18] lifted up on a pedestal Amen this is
[1:06:21] this is something that God will not
[1:06:23] allow this many men get lifted up on the
[1:06:26] pedestal and we start heading towards
[1:06:28] idolatry God will let them fall off the
[1:06:31] pedestal to get our eyes off of the man
[1:06:34] and get them back on God so you know
[1:06:37] what you don't want to see somebody a
[1:06:38] pastor and minister evangelist etc you
[1:06:41] don't want to see them fall off the
[1:06:42] pedestal don't lift them up there
[1:06:45] amen respect them the scripture says
[1:06:47] we're not respect as a person respect
[1:06:49] them as your brother your sister
[1:06:51] whatever it might be Ron's sister being
[1:06:53] lifted up but amen but you respect them
[1:06:57] for who they are sons and daughters of
[1:06:58] God amen
[1:07:00] give as it were respect or reverence to
[1:07:03] them but my brother and sister they're
[1:07:05] still just your brother amen so we don't
[1:07:09] need to be lifting them up let's look
[1:07:11] let the wisdom of God amen the power of
[1:07:13] God be what we lift up hallelujah
[1:07:16] now look God calls it you know men to
[1:07:19] offices in the ministry and etc of the
[1:07:21] church my brother and sister you know
[1:07:23] the coffin of God brought very good
[1:07:25] clarity in my opinion when he said if
[1:07:27] you have a problem you know this is me
[1:07:29] interpreting it so don't struggle you
[1:07:31] have a problem with that brother and you
[1:07:32] can't respect him there might be an
[1:07:34] issue you can't respect him at least
[1:07:35] respect the office that's how much value
[1:07:37] God put on the office so you struggle
[1:07:41] with a man at least respect to the
[1:07:42] office but when you come to the place
[1:07:44] that they disrespect the man in the
[1:07:47] office you realize they don't even
[1:07:48] respect the office I got to get on to my
[1:07:56] thought here we'll be here all day and
[1:07:58] some of you will then have an axe to
[1:08:02] grind
[1:08:02] oh my hallelujah amen now look I want to
[1:08:13] go right in here lay out my thought
[1:08:14] today help me Lord and how many tonight
[1:08:18] how many people have sold out their
[1:08:19] birthright to the things of the world
[1:08:21] and got away from God oh we got to be
[1:08:24] careful about that my brother and sister
[1:08:26] we're not talking about bad people we're
[1:08:28] talking about people that Satan has
[1:08:29] twisted circumstance twisted things and
[1:08:32] maybe in their life and their past in
[1:08:33] the church their relationship to the
[1:08:36] church to ministry amen and so they get
[1:08:39] it was kind of caught in a situation and
[1:08:41] they got away from God amen stay with
[1:08:44] the word that's the reason coming into a
[1:08:47] meeting talking about taking or talking
[1:08:50] about taking one I got a thumb down here
[1:08:53] Lord help me I'm just so wound up my
[1:08:55] help me Lord
[1:08:59] got away from God stay with the word
[1:09:03] that's the reason coming into a meeting
[1:09:06] talking about taking one another spirit
[1:09:09] coming into a meeting we like to stay
[1:09:11] right with the word stay with the word
[1:09:14] so that the spirit of the word will be
[1:09:17] on the people not the spirit of some
[1:09:19] fantastic or some minister or something
[1:09:22] that we have to answer for that in the
[1:09:24] day of judgment amen now this my brother
[1:09:27] and sister you look and there's several
[1:09:29] quotes where brother Branham talks about
[1:09:31] this he's talking about how if we're not
[1:09:33] careful that the people would come in
[1:09:35] and they might take on the spirit of
[1:09:37] their pastor and not the Holy Spirit or
[1:09:40] take on the spirit of another person
[1:09:42] without taking on the Spirit Holy Spirit
[1:09:44] so you look at that and we realize that
[1:09:46] we as humans are very subjective I'll
[1:09:49] put myself to this you know my wife she
[1:09:51] mocks me unmercifully we go to Australia
[1:09:55] in a couple days of being in Australia
[1:09:57] and she's like oh and where was you born
[1:09:59] at well I don't know mate it's just
[1:10:04] something that happened to me I go to
[1:10:05] the South she even she mocks me
[1:10:07] maybe I am throwing her under the bus
[1:10:10] maybe she'll repent from that behavior
[1:10:13] but we go to the south and next thing I
[1:10:15] know I'm saying y'all and she just can't
[1:10:18] help herself she's like oh where y'all
[1:10:21] from
[1:10:22] you know my brother and sister it's easy
[1:10:25] I recognize this it's easy sometimes to
[1:10:28] take on this spirit now look if you got
[1:10:30] a pastor that's mean and vindictive and
[1:10:33] you got this and he's brup tanned rude
[1:10:35] my brother and sister you getting it's
[1:10:36] like that and you'll find the people
[1:10:38] treat each other
[1:10:39] that very same way amen so you find that
[1:10:42] somewhere you have a church they the
[1:10:44] pastor he doesn't want to hurt anybody's
[1:10:45] feelings no where no how no time and
[1:10:47] pretty soon the church just lets
[1:10:49] anything go because well you know we
[1:10:51] just don't want to hurt their feelings
[1:10:52] that might be the Bride of Christ my
[1:10:55] brother and sister what we need to do is
[1:10:57] like the prophet of God said is stay
[1:10:59] with the word amen and the reason
[1:11:02] they're coming into a meeting talking
[1:11:03] about taking one another spirit coming
[1:11:05] into meeting we like to stay right with
[1:11:07] the words
[1:11:07] right with the words so that the spirit
[1:11:09] of the word will be on the people amen
[1:11:13] let me tell you you don't want to catch
[1:11:15] my spirit
[1:11:15] hey man you you know you don't want to
[1:11:18] think like I think I think some crazy
[1:11:20] thoughts sometimes I think things you
[1:11:22] know like Oh Lord if I was young again I
[1:11:24] would do this and this and then I
[1:11:26] remember I was young and I did that and
[1:11:28] that's why I have bad knees and ankles
[1:11:30] and elbows so you don't want to have
[1:11:33] that kind of we don't want to be the
[1:11:34] risk-taker oh well we'll just stand on
[1:11:38] this doctrine and well if it's not right
[1:11:40] we'll just take our chances no my
[1:11:43] brother and sister we're not gonna be
[1:11:44] the risk taker
[1:11:45] I want something solid reminds me many
[1:11:48] years ago a man come to me and he says
[1:11:50] hey brother Paul I've done an investment
[1:11:52] and he said you know this investment
[1:11:54] you'd be able to take that and brother
[1:11:56] Paul you just borrow a seven hundred and
[1:11:58] fifty thousand dollars on the farm and
[1:12:00] invested in this deal it'll bring this
[1:12:02] return it'll bring you back this many
[1:12:04] thousands dollars a month and you can
[1:12:07] make of the payment on the seven hundred
[1:12:08] and fifty thousand with this portion and
[1:12:10] it leaves you this portion to to live on
[1:12:13] and be free to be a pastor and never
[1:12:15] work again and I looked at that and I
[1:12:17] thought my if that is so good if this
[1:12:20] thing is so good oh it sounds so good my
[1:12:23] brother and sister I can borrow that
[1:12:24] money and literally have thousands every
[1:12:27] month to live on and looking at what
[1:12:29] sister Jerry and I live on I thought my
[1:12:31] three-times our life three times our
[1:12:33] life every month enough just a few
[1:12:36] months it's what we make in a whole year
[1:12:37] that's good but something in the back of
[1:12:39] my mind said now if this is so good why
[1:12:43] are they coming to the little people
[1:12:45] there's people out here that literally
[1:12:47] have millions they don't need to borrow
[1:12:48] against their farm they don't need to
[1:12:50] take a chance they don't need a rip
[1:12:52] they got millions sitting in the bank
[1:12:54] why aren't they getting 30% interest
[1:12:57] back on their money why are they coming
[1:12:59] to people like me amen I'll tell you I
[1:13:02] wasn't no but I'm not interested well
[1:13:04] it's sad because the man I guess we
[1:13:06] could call him a brother he told me I
[1:13:08] was foolish and that I was making one of
[1:13:10] the biggest mistakes in my life and when
[1:13:12] it made the front page news across the
[1:13:14] United States as one of the biggest
[1:13:16] Ponzi schemes that ever had come to the
[1:13:18] United States I thought that's
[1:13:19] interesting you see there is no free
[1:13:26] lunch you want to be an overcoming
[1:13:29] Christian have to pray you have to read
[1:13:31] your Bible you have to all well know the
[1:13:34] prophet of God tells us you shouldn't
[1:13:36] have someone telling you what to do
[1:13:38] that's not a relationship with the Lord
[1:13:40] if the pastor says now don't you go to
[1:13:42] the theater don't you drink don't you
[1:13:44] watch these filthy movies don't you
[1:13:45] listen to that music
[1:13:46] my brother's sister that's not the
[1:13:47] leadership for the Holy Ghost you need
[1:13:49] to get to a place that there's something
[1:13:51] inside of you that says praise the Lord
[1:13:53] I don't want to feed on that that's not
[1:13:56] me anyhow they created all of that
[1:13:58] nonsense for someone else amen so you
[1:14:01] don't need the pastor every Sunday to
[1:14:03] tell you not to do those things but now
[1:14:05] that I mentioned it we all not be doing
[1:14:09] those things hallelujah so people sell
[1:14:13] out their birth rights right and he's
[1:14:14] saying you know we're talking about
[1:14:16] getting one another spirit if we stay
[1:14:18] with the word so that the spirit of the
[1:14:21] word will be on the people not the
[1:14:23] spirit of something fantastic now
[1:14:25] brothers sisters I've been in services
[1:14:27] that we're speaking in tongues have to
[1:14:30] admit when it first started caught me a
[1:14:31] little off guard but then as my mind
[1:14:33] process this we're allowed to do that
[1:14:35] right we don't have to throw our brain
[1:14:36] in the trash when we become a believer I
[1:14:39] stop that's according to the word it
[1:14:42] didn't disrupt the BRIT to the preaching
[1:14:44] of the word it's on the word it's there
[1:14:47] it's correct and I just settled down and
[1:14:51] said Lord praise the Lord you hear and
[1:14:54] the words that were spoken in the
[1:14:56] interpretation or according to the word
[1:14:58] oh it didn't change one single thing in
[1:15:02] my life I still have to go live the word
[1:15:05] I can't say I've seen this I've been
[1:15:08] there I experienced it oh no my
[1:15:10] brother's sister we still got to live
[1:15:11] the word amen so we're not just gonna
[1:15:15] rely on some fantastic right I've told
[1:15:18] you many times here in the church that
[1:15:19] little girls aren't being healed amen
[1:15:21] not just healed as in the pain going
[1:15:23] away but literally the bones going right
[1:15:25] back into the place they're supposed to
[1:15:27] be so that the arm was like it was
[1:15:29] supposed to be I've witnessed through
[1:15:30] that I couldn't stand before you and
[1:15:32] Almighty God now
[1:15:33] i that saw her arm before i saw her arm
[1:15:37] after that little girl is not even
[1:15:38] serving god today now will she I believe
[1:15:43] she will but you see my brother and
[1:15:45] sister the supernatural come down and
[1:15:47] touched that little girl but that was
[1:15:50] not enough to keep her serving God amen
[1:15:55] it takes more than just coming in
[1:15:57] contact with what you might call the
[1:15:59] fantastic amen it takes something
[1:16:02] fantastic happening deep down in the
[1:16:04] soul amen when that happens hallelujah a
[1:16:07] no matter well or all hell assail you
[1:16:09] you'll keep serving God now this little
[1:16:11] girl she's a sweet little girl I pray
[1:16:13] for her amen I believe that God honored
[1:16:16] and healed her and he didn't just waste
[1:16:19] that effort and then she'll be back but
[1:16:21] my brother and sister in the day that we
[1:16:22] live in young people in the day that we
[1:16:24] live in discuss mama and daddy are good
[1:16:26] believers just because you went to a
[1:16:28] good church and you was raised up right
[1:16:29] that ain't going to be no kind of anchor
[1:16:31] for you you've got to get your own
[1:16:33] anchor a man you've never seen someone
[1:16:35] out on the river fishing drive over to
[1:16:38] another boat and say can I borrow your
[1:16:39] anchor you got to have your own anchor
[1:16:45] amen
[1:16:46] now look so not some fantastic or of
[1:16:50] some Minister that's one of the biggest
[1:16:51] things we have today I'm going to just
[1:16:53] labor on this for a minute
[1:16:54] amen that's the biggest thing we have
[1:16:56] today people are all identified I go to
[1:16:58] so and so's church well I'll tell you
[1:17:00] what my brother and sister sometimes
[1:17:02] it's just part of our vocabulary so I'm
[1:17:04] not judging you for that I'm gonna call
[1:17:06] you out on that as it were but there are
[1:17:08] those that are down in their heart is if
[1:17:11] you don't go to our church you are going
[1:17:14] to hell well my brother and sister
[1:17:16] that's going to be really hard when we
[1:17:18] have a universal gospel going into all
[1:17:20] the world and bring them back to your
[1:17:23] hometown
[1:17:25] no go you in all the world and preach
[1:17:29] the gospel the life of Jesus Christ let
[1:17:31] them see the life amen then let them
[1:17:34] colonize or whatever you want to call it
[1:17:36] their own community by sharing the
[1:17:39] gospel hallelujah amen now as we look at
[1:17:43] this I want to just go back into the
[1:17:45] scripture if we could brother Ivan
[1:17:47] sister Vika amen I'm proud of sister
[1:17:50] Vika she's getting pretty good at this
[1:17:52] amen now look at this which things also
[1:17:56] we speak not in the words which man's
[1:17:58] wisdom teaches but which the Holy Ghost
[1:18:00] teacheth comparing spiritual things with
[1:18:03] spiritual you see my brother and sister
[1:18:06] we can we can get into man's wisdom I've
[1:18:09] shared this many times I'll just bump on
[1:18:11] it real quick here now you know to set
[1:18:13] there and have someone tell you well
[1:18:15] brother Paul we can't fully understand
[1:18:17] what was spoke right here unless we know
[1:18:19] the Hebrew and I'm doing a home study
[1:18:22] Hebrew course and I thought I might as
[1:18:24] well just quit because I can't even
[1:18:26] hardly do English and I tried to learn
[1:18:28] Spanish and did I'm just a terrible job
[1:18:30] on that and moving on to Hebrew I'm out
[1:18:33] of luck but my brother and sister you
[1:18:35] see it's not by man's wisdom I would
[1:18:39] rather have God speak to me then learn
[1:18:41] 10 languages amen I would rather have
[1:18:45] God speaking through me through the
[1:18:47] foolishness of preaching than me sitting
[1:18:49] home in my dark little office trying to
[1:18:51] figure out which Greek or Hebrew or
[1:18:53] Arabic word meant what amen because I'll
[1:18:56] just give you a hint there's many of
[1:18:58] them are so close to each other but
[1:19:01] different and here we are all the way
[1:19:05] down through history now reading this
[1:19:06] and saying one scholar says it's Arabic
[1:19:10] another one says it's Greek another one
[1:19:11] says it's Hebrew but the words are also
[1:19:13] close my we're not going to make it into
[1:19:17] rapture until we can resurrect these
[1:19:18] guys and ask them which one they were
[1:19:20] using no let the Spirit of God speak
[1:19:25] amen
[1:19:27] speak Lord receive not the things of the
[1:19:32] spirit for they are foolishness unto
[1:19:33] them neither can he know them because
[1:19:36] they are spiritually discerned so all of
[1:19:39] this my brother and sister cannot be
[1:19:40] brought about in a natural element it
[1:19:43] must come with the Holy Ghost teaching
[1:19:46] us comparing the spiritual with the
[1:19:49] spiritual amen that's why we cannot put
[1:19:53] the Bible to the side and say well we
[1:19:55] have a message my brother and sister we
[1:19:58] have the Bible for a purpose
[1:20:00] but God made it an anchor post forest he
[1:20:03] himself declared it was his absolute if
[1:20:06] it's good enough for him
[1:20:07] amen it'll be good enough for you and I
[1:20:09] hallelujah
[1:20:10] look at this for who hath known the mind
[1:20:14] of the Lord that he may instruct him but
[1:20:16] we have the mind of Christ that's pretty
[1:20:18] bold words the Apostle Paul is speaking
[1:20:20] they're really bold words he's telling
[1:20:22] look we don't have to have this over
[1:20:25] here amen we're not going to come to a
[1:20:28] place we can tell God I tell you I say
[1:20:31] this partly in humor but partly in a way
[1:20:33] it amazes me and you know sometimes I do
[1:20:36] listen to other things and and this man
[1:20:39] one day was making the excellent point
[1:20:41] and I was enjoying what he had to say
[1:20:42] til he got to this spot where he said
[1:20:44] well what God really meant was I was
[1:20:51] like oh well I think what God really
[1:20:55] meant was what he said I think that
[1:21:02] applied to the prophets message my oh my
[1:21:10] the reminder once speak on fresh
[1:21:15] revelation amen
[1:21:16] God who is rich in mercy we'll go
[1:21:20] through here here we go if a man comes
[1:21:27] out with an odd peculiar ministry that's
[1:21:31] found in the Bible to be the truth let's
[1:21:34] just stop right there none of you read
[1:21:37] ahead you're cheating you might find the
[1:21:42] ministry that what he's saying he has a
[1:21:45] unique way of bringing it he has a
[1:21:47] different approach to it and that's all
[1:21:50] good if it's found in the Bible but he
[1:21:56] says and that man stays right in the
[1:21:58] same old denominational doctrine forget
[1:22:00] it
[1:22:01] you can't go right down into the deep
[1:22:05] things of God and just say well that's
[1:22:08] good look at this revelation but we're
[1:22:10] gonna just stay as we are our families
[1:22:13] you know for six generations have been
[1:22:15] Methodists or Baptists or whatever you
[1:22:19] know my family we're such a Heinen's 59
[1:22:22] is that all right to say Heinz 57
[1:22:26] okay I'll reduce it a little bit we got
[1:22:30] Baptists we got Methodists
[1:22:32] we've got Catholics we've got Mormons I
[1:22:34] think we even have a seventh-day
[1:22:36] Adventist hid in there somewhere my mix
[1:22:40] that all together what do you got one
[1:22:44] man told me and he was trying to be
[1:22:46] humorous because he comes from a very
[1:22:47] similar background he said well I tell
[1:22:50] you throw our family together and they
[1:22:52] get to arguing about that and he says
[1:22:53] they all because they're family and they
[1:22:54] love each other they come to conclusion
[1:22:56] and that is we go on Wednesday to visit
[1:22:58] he said we go on Saturday to go to
[1:23:00] church and we worship on Sunday what is
[1:23:07] it convoluted convoluted but you see if
[1:23:13] a man comes out and comes out with
[1:23:14] something that is truth but he stay
[1:23:17] right in his old denominational doctor
[1:23:18] and forget it nothing to it God don't do
[1:23:20] it like that that thing that's rotten
[1:23:22] manna that's got termites in it or
[1:23:24] wiggle tails or whatever you want to
[1:23:25] call it from 4050 years ago now come on
[1:23:28] Saints this can't apply to you and I
[1:23:30] this is not oh look at them poor
[1:23:33] denominational people amen whatever you
[1:23:37] want to call it 40 50 years ago still
[1:23:39] trying to eat that old manner that fell
[1:23:40] way back years ago and the children of
[1:23:43] Israel in their journey knew manna fell
[1:23:45] every night that's right you couldn't
[1:23:47] keep it over you we don't live over the
[1:23:50] same thing age gone by we're eating new
[1:23:53] man a fresh man out of heaven in our
[1:23:55] journey as we go on hallelujah now look
[1:23:58] some people say well there's brother
[1:24:00] Paul bashing on the Prophet and the
[1:24:01] message again no you're actually so so
[1:24:04] totally a hundred and eighty degrees off
[1:24:06] because my brother and sister this is a
[1:24:08] living message it didn't stop in 1965
[1:24:12] when brother Branham preached his last
[1:24:13] sermon it did not stop when
[1:24:15] there so-and-so passed away or brother
[1:24:17] so-and-so over here but this word is
[1:24:20] living it is new manna every single
[1:24:24] night
[1:24:24] Amen it falls and God comes fresh on
[1:24:27] these people and it will be there people
[1:24:29] say well we gotta have this and we gonna
[1:24:31] have that look stop what is the word say
[1:24:34] what is a prophet of God say no manna
[1:24:36] and you can't keep it over
[1:24:39] it gets wiggle tails hallelujah we can
[1:24:42] stop and look I'm gonna be direct this
[1:24:44] morning I hope I don't offend the one
[1:24:46] but we can look and say look what God
[1:24:47] did with brother Branham right here look
[1:24:49] what was happening right there you
[1:24:51] looking back my brother and sister you
[1:24:52] guaranteed to crash the prophet of God
[1:24:55] even gave an analogy as it were to that
[1:24:57] and you don't look in the rearview
[1:24:59] mirror you're gonna you gotta be looking
[1:25:01] forward what does that mean they very
[1:25:03] that come down revealed the word to a
[1:25:05] prophet that broke open the whole Bible
[1:25:08] made it a new book my brother and sister
[1:25:10] is the same God that's here in Grace
[1:25:13] Tabernacle this morning opening the
[1:25:15] Bible making it a new book this morning
[1:25:17] a man not when you got saved it's not
[1:25:21] just a new book from that moment it's a
[1:25:23] new book here this morning Amen that you
[1:25:27] and I could look in the word and we can
[1:25:28] say praise the Lord I see what the
[1:25:31] Prophet was talking about right here
[1:25:33] it's coming to pass not around the world
[1:25:35] somewhere it's coming to pass right here
[1:25:37] in my hometown it might even be coming
[1:25:40] pass on the positive note right here in
[1:25:42] our church but it takes a living God to
[1:25:45] make it come my brother and sister just
[1:25:47] cuz it was spoke years ago unless God
[1:25:50] backed it up it would never come to pass
[1:25:52] but it is it is coming to pass
[1:25:59] hallelujah oh so people sometimes my
[1:26:04] brother and sister they say you're so
[1:26:05] caught up Oh what about this this is
[1:26:08] lovely this lovely well you know what
[1:26:10] when the prophet of God I want to go
[1:26:11] right back to this prophet of God
[1:26:12] talking about that eagle it goes there
[1:26:14] they're up there on the mountain amen if
[1:26:16] no other eagle ever comes now I'm
[1:26:18] talking about some unity we have all
[1:26:20] kinds of unity I heard a guy the other
[1:26:21] day saying well there's gonna come a day
[1:26:23] here when we're gonna have unity in the
[1:26:25] message all the way around the world
[1:26:31] no we're not no we're not I'm sorry
[1:26:36] unity in the bride yes but not just in
[1:26:42] the message it's always been that way
[1:26:47] every move every move of God's always
[1:26:50] had that the prophet of God said there's
[1:26:51] three kinds of believers it's a make
[1:26:54] believe we're gonna start uniting and
[1:26:56] saying well hallelujah
[1:26:57] I got a die to myself I've got to get
[1:27:00] filled with the Holy Ghost I got to get
[1:27:02] in the word fill my lamp know my brother
[1:27:04] and sister and make believer can't go
[1:27:05] there the unbelievers not going to go
[1:27:08] there but these are still identified as
[1:27:10] message now this might be a little
[1:27:14] directed it is forgive me but look my
[1:27:17] brother and sister we got to focus on
[1:27:18] what is uh what it is what is the word
[1:27:20] for you and I okay now this will be even
[1:27:23] more offensive and I hope it isn't but
[1:27:25] if you're an unbeliever
[1:27:26] don't don't don't act like you're a
[1:27:28] believer acknowledge I don't believe
[1:27:30] this and we respect you for that
[1:27:33] amen I got friends and I've witnessed -
[1:27:35] and they've got me Paul I don't know
[1:27:37] what you believe but I just can't
[1:27:38] believe that our church
[1:27:40] we're Lutheran's nobody ever taught us
[1:27:42] that okay I respect that he never
[1:27:46] brought it up again I've never brought
[1:27:48] it up again he's still my friend but you
[1:27:51] see my brother and sister we have a
[1:27:52] responsibility to realize that if the
[1:27:54] man is here we've got to eat it you
[1:27:59] can't say well you know that was Old
[1:28:00] Testament stuff the manna no no fresh
[1:28:02] manna man is coming out of heaven right
[1:28:04] right today amen the word is coming down
[1:28:07] today hallelujah hallelujah see I'm not
[1:28:12] talking about a new revelation
[1:28:13] there's people get all bent out of shape
[1:28:14] when you start talking about things like
[1:28:16] this you know a fresh revelation Oh what
[1:28:19] are you doing new you know no we're not
[1:28:21] talking about adding to the word my
[1:28:22] brother and sister Amen I'm not talking
[1:28:24] about taking away from the word I'm
[1:28:26] talking us right realizing that we are
[1:28:29] led by the Spirit of God to have the
[1:28:33] mind of Christ
[1:28:34] and in that the Bible became a new book
[1:28:37] this is not cliches this is the truth
[1:28:40] there's a truth though Bible becomes a
[1:28:42] new book if you read the Bible and put
[1:28:44] it down and got no inspiration from it
[1:28:47] you need to stop go back and pray and
[1:28:49] read that scripture again in fact you
[1:28:56] know that's one of the things I've
[1:28:57] voiced it to you through the years I've
[1:28:58] never been all excited about these read
[1:29:00] the Bible in a year now brother and
[1:29:02] sister because you see these people they
[1:29:04] pick up their Bible amen and I applaud
[1:29:06] them they're picking up their Bible and
[1:29:08] they're reading it but they pick up
[1:29:09] their Bible and this is the way those
[1:29:11] things work I've got I'm over here and
[1:29:13] do two romani I've got to read 23 verses
[1:29:15] and then I've got to go over here into
[1:29:17] Isaiah and I have to read 12 verses
[1:29:19] today then I've got to go over here into
[1:29:21] the book of Acts and read 22 in a year
[1:29:29] later what did you get out of the Bible
[1:29:36] come on Saints I tell you just read that
[1:29:39] same two three four five scriptures
[1:29:41] fifty times if you've got to read it for
[1:29:44] it to speak to you and when it speaks to
[1:29:47] you you'll never forget it but if it
[1:29:50] never speaks to you it's just like
[1:29:51] reading a book Alleluia
[1:29:55] I'm sorry this sounds a little mocking
[1:29:57] and I don't mean it to but we might as
[1:29:59] well just start to read the Encyclopedia
[1:30:00] in a year and I knew a kid in high
[1:30:03] school that did that he was really smart
[1:30:07] not only I'll tell you how smart he was
[1:30:09] he tell you
[1:30:10] in the prett Anika on page 774 oh yeah
[1:30:17] what did I say well it has this subject
[1:30:20] this subject this subject this subject
[1:30:21] and then he would just do and I thought
[1:30:23] he's just fooling us I'll go into the
[1:30:25] library I get the Britannica out turn
[1:30:27] seven seven four and there it is halfway
[1:30:28] down the page great awesome
[1:30:37] but he couldn't tie his shoes he walked
[1:30:43] down the hallway in high school with his
[1:30:45] shoelaces dragging behind him all the
[1:30:47] time one day I was sitting there joking
[1:30:51] with him he was a friend of mine joking
[1:30:53] with him
[1:30:53] I said who taught you to tie your
[1:30:55] shoelaces and he said my little brother
[1:31:01] that explains who taught his little
[1:31:04] brother well whatever it was it wouldn't
[1:31:08] wouldn't sustain it didn't work my
[1:31:12] brother and sister what we need is to
[1:31:14] catch the real revelation we need to
[1:31:16] catch this revelation that there is
[1:31:17] manna falling today it's fresh it's not
[1:31:20] old blue you know does that mean catch a
[1:31:24] spirit here does that mean we are
[1:31:26] putting the message behind us no it
[1:31:30] doesn't it's the message unfolding to us
[1:31:35] it's the message not just words on a
[1:31:38] tape letters on a page it is a living
[1:31:42] word of God coming alive in you and I
[1:31:47] hallelujah there's where the difference
[1:31:49] is
[1:31:49] amen moving beyond brother branham well
[1:31:52] you know that can always be a little bit
[1:31:54] of a controversial statement also
[1:31:56] because the Prophet himself said I must
[1:31:58] decrease that he might increase and so
[1:32:02] that means that somewhere along the line
[1:32:04] he's going to stop being the preeminent
[1:32:07] thought that we have and our Prima
[1:32:09] thought is Jesus Christ rising up before
[1:32:13] the people amen
[1:32:15] oh this getting deep water brother Paul
[1:32:17] that's good I brought my life jacket and
[1:32:19] my waders amen because my brother and
[1:32:22] sister it all depends on what you think
[1:32:23] the message is some people think that it
[1:32:26] is just words printed on the page and
[1:32:28] voice on a tape that we listen to of a
[1:32:30] man speaking named William Branham but
[1:32:32] I'm sorry when I was young man not even
[1:32:35] fully serving the Lord kind of just
[1:32:37] doing what I wanted I thought that
[1:32:39] understanding that the message was Jesus
[1:32:42] Christ amen now God has always used man
[1:32:46] down through the age he's used them for
[1:32:48] his purpose as his mouthpiece as
[1:32:51] his labour sister Jerry and I was
[1:32:52] driving down the road discussing you
[1:32:54] know how is it you know here is brother
[1:32:56] branham sitting in a service young man
[1:32:58] young woman making love to each other
[1:33:00] kissing and smacking and cuddling and
[1:33:02] whatever and God dealing with him that
[1:33:04] whatever he spoke my brother and sister
[1:33:07] would be what happened to those and
[1:33:08] sister Jerry brought this up because we
[1:33:10] just been studying coming across these
[1:33:12] things and and you know my brother and
[1:33:14] sister met redemption amen
[1:33:17] what is Redemption Amen well repentance
[1:33:20] is Redemption it is in repentance that
[1:33:24] we find Redemption and so here is this
[1:33:27] young couple doing what they're doing
[1:33:29] and I believe with all my heart call me
[1:33:31] silly if you want to I believe with all
[1:33:33] my heart that if brother Branham had
[1:33:35] said let the judgment of God fall on
[1:33:36] them they'd had died right there
[1:33:38] amen they might have thrown a whole
[1:33:41] terror into that church but I tell you
[1:33:43] what it would also done it would have
[1:33:44] scared a lot of people away that just
[1:33:46] needed to know a little love of Jesus
[1:33:48] Christ so what does he do I forgive them
[1:33:50] amen
[1:33:51] what does God do he comes he corrects
[1:33:53] that they stop what they're doing
[1:33:54] because the Spirit of God move now you
[1:33:56] compare that to Elijah and they're
[1:33:59] calling him some old bald-headed prophet
[1:34:01] I imagine some of those words were
[1:34:02] probably just pretty strong and does he
[1:34:05] do he calls those she bears out and it
[1:34:07] kills all them boys my brother and
[1:34:08] sister well you say well I guess brother
[1:34:10] Brown would have had you know every bit
[1:34:12] of right as he lie she did but what was
[1:34:17] the gift for what was the season it was
[1:34:23] not a season of judgment it was a season
[1:34:26] of restoration now if that young couple
[1:34:30] didn't Nate never came to the Lord
[1:34:32] that's a possibility but I'll tell you
[1:34:34] what would happen someone have been in
[1:34:35] there that needed to know the love of
[1:34:37] God and they realized you know what
[1:34:39] those kids deserved whatever would have
[1:34:40] come on their but Lord so would I oh can
[1:34:43] we say that this morning but so bad I
[1:34:45] whatever would come upon me Lord no I
[1:34:48] don't want to I don't want to jump to my
[1:34:49] brother I don't want to judge my sister
[1:34:51] Lord because either judgment would come
[1:34:53] on me
[1:34:53] none are perfect but him hallelujah oh
[1:34:57] but look at this not a revelation to add
[1:35:00] or take away but we must be led by the
[1:35:03] spirit to under
[1:35:04] and what has even been given to us you
[1:35:06] see it's energized my brother and sister
[1:35:09] it's energized into the inner man it's
[1:35:11] not an outward thing if it's just on our
[1:35:13] flesh on the outside then the season
[1:35:16] will come that the anointing will leave
[1:35:17] the flesh and the flesh will go back
[1:35:19] where the flesh came from but my brother
[1:35:21] and sister when it's energized on the
[1:35:23] inside the Holy Spirit moving down deep
[1:35:26] into the soul amen it energizes that
[1:35:28] inner man and he has a fresh
[1:35:30] understanding and it comes right from
[1:35:33] the throne of God comes right from the
[1:35:35] throne of God and comes to him or her
[1:35:37] young or all but you see some don't be
[1:35:41] as possible they say well the prophets
[1:35:43] off the scene there's no relation coming
[1:35:45] from the throne well my brother and
[1:35:46] sister I'm telling you you're wrong not
[1:35:50] here to argue about it or whatever but
[1:35:52] I'm telling you you're wrong because
[1:35:53] there's inspiration coming from the
[1:35:56] throne of God
[1:35:57] there's revelation coming from the
[1:35:59] throne of God every single day to those
[1:36:02] that are seeking it now if you don't
[1:36:05] believe it's for you then it's not for
[1:36:07] you amen I just come across the other
[1:36:09] day wished I could tell you the service
[1:36:11] but brother Branham was praying and this
[1:36:13] lady comes up in the prayer line and
[1:36:14] she's needing healing and brother
[1:36:16] Branham says you need faith now what
[1:36:21] would you rather have would you rather
[1:36:24] have healing or faith see we have proof
[1:36:31] right on the tape you can track it all
[1:36:33] down a woman come in the prayer line got
[1:36:35] prayed for a guy healed went home never
[1:36:37] desired one more thing she went right
[1:36:40] back to her own life only now she's
[1:36:42] healed but I'll tell you what faith will
[1:36:44] do faith will bring you to a place for
[1:36:47] healing of your body but faith will also
[1:36:49] bring you into a place that you crave a
[1:36:51] deeper relationship with Jesus Christ oh
[1:36:54] give me faith hallelujah
[1:36:57] Patrick hippy said give me liberty or
[1:36:59] give me death I say my brother and
[1:37:01] sister Lord give us faith or just take
[1:37:04] us from the earth now because with faith
[1:37:06] we cannot accomplish anything hallelujah
[1:37:09] amen proverbs - one through eleven amen
[1:37:13] I love this scripture it's just
[1:37:16] beautiful my son if thou wilt receive my
[1:37:20] words
[1:37:21] ya see we got to receive the word
[1:37:23] otherwise it's all for naught and hide
[1:37:26] my Commandments with thee so that thou
[1:37:29] incline thine ear unto wisdom and apply
[1:37:33] that heart to understanding yay if thou
[1:37:36] criest after knowledge and lift us up
[1:37:40] thy voice for understanding now look at
[1:37:45] verse 4
[1:37:46] well III cried I've signed and cried for
[1:37:50] the abominations of City Lord forgive
[1:37:52] all these heathens was that really a
[1:37:55] sigh and a cry my brother and sister too
[1:37:58] many of us cry after a knowledge we cry
[1:38:04] for understanding but if somebody told
[1:38:08] you there was a hole in the ground on
[1:38:10] the mountain with silver in it you'd put
[1:38:14] more effort climbing the mountain and
[1:38:16] then you would the knowledge of God
[1:38:18] that's kind of straight I'm sorry to put
[1:38:21] it that way but then again I'm not
[1:38:22] sometimes we just need to face it
[1:38:24] you see if that was Cephas her talking
[1:38:27] about knowledge and understanding if
[1:38:29] thou seekest her as silver and searches
[1:38:32] for her as for hid treasures
[1:38:38] you know reminds me one time off the
[1:38:41] coast of Florida this man did research I
[1:38:44] don't want to exaggerate but I do
[1:38:45] believe it was something like 16 or 17
[1:38:47] years a Spanish galleon that had left
[1:38:54] Mexico or down in that area was sailing
[1:38:57] it sailed off the tip of Florida they're
[1:39:00] going back to Europe the stories through
[1:39:02] the piers were that that ship was laden
[1:39:04] with gold and silver and the stories
[1:39:07] never change didn't matter whether
[1:39:09] you're talking native people families
[1:39:11] that somehow had some relative or
[1:39:13] something associated and through the
[1:39:14] years and this became a lore but this
[1:39:17] this man he's I don't know his name I
[1:39:19] don't remember it but we probably could
[1:39:22] find it because he's a known treasure
[1:39:23] hunter in that part of the world and he
[1:39:26] studied the stories and the accounts
[1:39:28] that came from various places
[1:39:30] and he decided I believe there's merit
[1:39:32] to this story now we're talking a long
[1:39:34] long time like a long long time like 350
[1:39:42] years or something
[1:39:46] don't take my math I just realized my
[1:39:48] math is bad so as he do he spends 17 16
[1:39:55] 17 years and it keeps getting these hits
[1:39:59] on the area off of Florida there but
[1:40:04] it's one of those things that when one
[1:40:05] of those big storms wouldn't come it
[1:40:06] would shift the seafloor move sand and
[1:40:08] he would the hits that he would find
[1:40:10] before that he couldn't detect them any
[1:40:13] longer and then seasons go by and he
[1:40:17] would be out there again and he would
[1:40:19] detect and then he couldn't he could
[1:40:22] find it and he couldn't find it and he
[1:40:23] could find it but it was in like 300
[1:40:26] foot of water just a little bit too deep
[1:40:28] to freedive took a little more equipment
[1:40:30] a little more effort but over the years
[1:40:32] he become so convinced that there was a
[1:40:35] ship there so they get the equipment
[1:40:39] they get all the stuff together and he
[1:40:43] dives a lot of currents down there was
[1:40:46] really really dangerous dive and he's
[1:40:49] going over the seafloor and his little
[1:40:53] detector thing he has keeps going off
[1:40:55] but he can't see anything and then the
[1:40:58] storms would come and he'd have to quit
[1:41:00] and he come back again in a year and
[1:41:07] then a particularly bad storm had passed
[1:41:09] through and something in his instinct
[1:41:12] told him now's the time the oceans been
[1:41:15] stirred up go and he tells his one
[1:41:19] friend he says you know much money as
[1:41:22] this cost this might be the last time I
[1:41:23] can afford to do this it just too
[1:41:25] expensive costing hundreds of thousands
[1:41:27] of dollars for all this support and he
[1:41:30] goes down to the bottom and he's walking
[1:41:33] along the bottom with his helmet on and
[1:41:35] his air hose and all this stuff
[1:41:37] and he looks down and there is a solid
[1:41:42] gold face
[1:41:44] and he picks it up he looks at it and
[1:41:49] says where there is I believe this was
[1:41:52] his words where there is one blessing
[1:41:54] there's always another and he got down
[1:41:58] and started digging and he found gold
[1:42:01] coins
[1:42:02] he found whatever he ended up splitting
[1:42:04] it I don't remember what the deal was
[1:42:06] his share of it when it was all done was
[1:42:09] millions of dollars if thou seekest her
[1:42:17] as silver and searches for her as for
[1:42:22] hid treasures well I went to church on
[1:42:25] Sunday I didn't like what the preacher
[1:42:27] was preaching on I'm done how deep you
[1:42:30] digging if that's all the deeper you go
[1:42:32] you're not gonna find knowledge or
[1:42:34] understanding you got to get past the
[1:42:37] preachers sorry church you got to get
[1:42:39] past Paul you got to get past Grace
[1:42:42] Tabernacle you got to get past all these
[1:42:45] things you can't take on the spirit of
[1:42:47] anything else around here you got to get
[1:42:49] on the spirit of Christ amen
[1:42:51] for the Lord giveth oh now shall
[1:42:54] understand the fear of the Lord and find
[1:42:56] the knowledge of God for the Lord giveth
[1:42:58] wisdom out of his mouth cometh knowledge
[1:43:00] and understanding he layeth up sound
[1:43:02] wisdom for the righteous he is a buckler
[1:43:05] to them that walk uprightly he keepeth
[1:43:08] the passive judgment and preserveth the
[1:43:10] way of his Saints then shall understand
[1:43:12] righteousness and judgment and equity
[1:43:15] yay every good path when wisdom in earth
[1:43:18] into thine heart and knowledge is
[1:43:20] pleasant into thine sole discretion
[1:43:22] shall preserve the understanding shall
[1:43:25] keep thee Oh hallelujah how about this
[1:43:29] is just the revelation of Jesus Christ
[1:43:31] amen can we take that right now this
[1:43:34] morning do we are we students enough of
[1:43:36] the message to take the revelation of
[1:43:38] Jesus Christ and apply it right into
[1:43:40] these scripture and right here you're
[1:43:42] not going to just run out and find the
[1:43:44] revelation of Jesus Christ you're gonna
[1:43:45] have to as a son or daughter of God
[1:43:47] you're gonna have to constantly be as it
[1:43:50] were in pursuit of it you're gonna have
[1:43:52] to constantly be saying Lord I want to
[1:43:54] see more of you I want to understand
[1:43:55] more of
[1:43:56] I want your mind or push my mind out and
[1:43:59] fill it with your mind because without
[1:44:02] that kind of hunger without kind of
[1:44:04] desire we will become traditional we
[1:44:08] will be less grace tabernacle is a
[1:44:10] message church we believe all of the
[1:44:12] message brother branham blah blah and
[1:44:14] blah blah blah and blah blah blah my
[1:44:16] brother and sister that won't be good
[1:44:17] enough hey man that won't be good enough
[1:44:19] knowing that there's a prophet on this
[1:44:21] scene amen won't get you in a rapture
[1:44:23] knowing Jesus Christ will get you in a
[1:44:26] rapture hallelujah because it's that
[1:44:29] wisdom it's that knowledge it's that
[1:44:31] understanding and when the world tries
[1:44:33] to baffle you with all of its we have
[1:44:35] proof here we have proof there my
[1:44:37] brother and sister I tell you the proof
[1:44:38] I have it's right down inside here it's
[1:44:41] not external you can knock down every
[1:44:44] Church in the Middle East as Isis and
[1:44:47] all that was doing believing they were
[1:44:49] accomplishing something
[1:44:50] destroying church after church after
[1:44:52] church thinking we're wiping them off
[1:44:54] the face of the earth they're not wiping
[1:44:56] the Bride of Christ off the face of the
[1:44:58] earth
[1:44:58] amen there's nothing out here knock down
[1:45:01] every Church take away everything
[1:45:03] because the knowledge and the wisdom and
[1:45:06] the virtue and the righteousness of
[1:45:08] Almighty God is not external its
[1:45:11] internal and it's right down in the soul
[1:45:14] and they gonna lock you in the jail and
[1:45:16] you can have a revival Amen do we don't
[1:45:19] have scripture for that amen they can
[1:45:22] try and shut you up throw you in the
[1:45:24] burning oil and you can step right out
[1:45:26] of there and say praise the Lord
[1:45:28] amen because we're not living in this
[1:45:31] flesh we're not living in some old dead
[1:45:34] message of a day gone by but we've got a
[1:45:37] fresh revelation and it came this
[1:45:40] morning and it's coming even more this
[1:45:42] morning because God is present on the
[1:45:44] scene hallelujah oh I love that
[1:45:48] scripture amen now I got a hurry along
[1:45:51] here now if Jesus Christ is the vine in
[1:45:54] his life now remember the vine does not
[1:45:56] bear fruit the branch bears fruit but
[1:45:59] it's energized
[1:46:00] come on Saints not just a little bit of
[1:46:03] SAP trickling oh come on we got way too

[1:46:13] leave that rest well then if the life of
[1:46:16] Christ being us it'll bring his spirit
[1:46:18] and his work right it's got to because
[1:46:20] it's the vine of God so what we're
[1:46:23] looking for is not just a little bit of
[1:46:25] a something trickling up and down you
[1:46:27] know something getting pushed out of the
[1:46:28] branch into us you know being kind of
[1:46:30] forced on is my brother and sister I'll
[1:46:32] tell you what I like I like it when I
[1:46:34] come to church and there's something me
[1:46:35] in me that is just so excited amen so
[1:46:38] excited to be in the house of God

[1:47:22] very first thing I said lord I need you
[1:47:24] to help me I stood up said another 100
[1:47:27] some siphon tubes him walked off and
[1:47:30] worked the rest of day but I'll tell you
[1:47:32] where this flesh is that this flesh is
[1:47:34] getting wore out hallelujah the Lord
[1:47:38] tarries I hope you guys are all very
[1:47:40] very sympathetic to Pastor for life
[1:47:42] because I'm going to need it is this
[1:47:46] work stuff is getting to be too much
[1:47:49] look you know what happens Saints come
[1:47:52] on I hope you have a sense of humor no
[1:47:56] no I wasn't trying to peddle something
[1:47:58] on you like okay now I just need you
[1:48:00] guys to send me four thousand three
[1:48:01] hundred sixty two dollars and sixteen
[1:48:03] cents every month no no no no I have a
[1:48:07] sense of humor now let's go back to the
[1:48:11] vineyard here we got the branch and the
[1:48:15] vine my brother and sister you know what
[1:48:18] they do even in modern day vineyard we
[1:48:20] got a lot of them out there we'll reform
[1:48:23] every spring they'll be just hundreds of
[1:48:25] guys walking up now hundreds of folks
[1:48:26] walking up and down the field they got
[1:48:28] all these little nippers you don't need
[1:48:30] big me first because you're not chopping
[1:48:32] off big branches you're chopping off the
[1:48:36] vine and all of that stuff I mean you
[1:48:41] would think they've gone crazy right
[1:48:42] they want they want that stuff for
[1:48:44] grapes to grow on it and they're walking
[1:48:47] along there one on each side this roast
[1:48:50] it's just a litter of trash behind them
[1:48:54] what are they doing those little
[1:48:55] branches all drew grapes last year what
[1:48:58] are you guys doing but you know what
[1:49:00] what's happening right now st. all that
[1:49:02] growth is coming out and it's all coming
[1:49:04] where is it the life was never in that
[1:49:08] it was down in the fine
[1:49:12] it was down in the root it wasn't up
[1:49:16] here in the stock Amen now look what
[1:49:20] we're looking at now is this word coming
[1:49:23] back to a people amen so the old brittle
[1:49:26] branch cannot bring forth fruit right
[1:49:30] the Master Gardener he cuts away I think
[1:49:32] that's dead so if you walk out a church
[1:49:34] sometimes you feel like somebody's been
[1:49:35] cutting on you
[1:49:36] oh the pastor made a couple cutting
[1:49:38] statements well stop and say thank you
[1:49:40] lord I didn't need that amen
[1:49:42] so the vine puts out a new branch and it
[1:49:44] bears the fruit of the vine
[1:49:47] now lamentations 3 in 22 oh my where my
[1:49:53] at hear the lamentations 322 on their
[1:49:55] brother Ivan anyway it's all right

[1:50:21] him
[1:50:21] the Lord is good unto them that wait for
[1:50:24] him to the soul that seeketh him it is
[1:50:27] good that a man should both hope and
[1:50:30] quietly wait for the salvation of the
[1:50:33] Lord

[1:50:55] and you look at that and realize if it
[1:50:57] was not without God's grace we would

[1:51:06] morning is falling on you and I now it's
[1:51:10] there that compassion my brother and
[1:51:12] sister is bringing grace to us but that
[1:51:15] same compassion is bringing his life his

[1:51:20] us because that manner that come my
[1:51:22] brother and sister now brother branham I
[1:51:24] might skip over this because a

[1:51:27] talking about how a little boy you know
[1:51:29] was asking his mama he says mama now did
[1:51:31] Jesus did God have great big ovens up
[1:51:33] there in heaven making all that manner

[1:51:39] man as it was with the five thousand
[1:51:42] just tear a chunk off my brother and
[1:51:43] sister
[1:51:44] he didn't tear that loaf down to where
[1:51:46] he was down there picking at the crumbs
[1:51:47] if we could just catch the vision of God
[1:51:50] the Creator in our mists and he's
[1:51:53] breaking off a piece of bread and right
[1:51:55] there before their eyes it's coming
[1:51:57] right back breaking it off it's coming

[1:52:09] showing us the creative value that he
[1:52:11] placed in the Bride of Christ I put my
[1:52:13] word in you oh I hope you with me I put
[1:52:16] my word in you and my word will not
[1:52:20] diminish it will not fade away it cannot
[1:52:22] fail because I'm the creator that
[1:52:25] created the word in the beginning and I
[1:52:28] put it in you so no matter how strenuous
[1:52:31] your life is no matter the troubles and
[1:52:34] travail you go through amen my brother
[1:52:38] and sister no matter the word is there
[1:52:41] and is always there it is sufficient
[1:52:45] amen can we trust him hallelujah let it
[1:52:50] fall every morning what is this this is
[1:52:53] a fresh revelation coming down on the
[1:52:56] Bride of Christ to wake up and say I'm
[1:52:58] an overcomer today hallelujah I've got
[1:53:01] to Christ in me I've got the word in me
[1:53:04] amen another day yesterday might have
[1:53:07] been terrible I'll tell you what I think
[1:53:08] I think the Bride of Christ must be the
[1:53:10] world's greatest optimist though all
[1:53:14] hail or sell you in the world's falling
[1:53:16] down yesterday we get up in the morning
[1:53:18] praise the Lord
[1:53:19] I'm an overcomer today God's mercy is
[1:53:22] upon me his blessings are on me well you
[1:53:24] know what about your business its
[1:53:26] failing what about this over here and
[1:53:27] what about that over there what about
[1:53:29] this circumstance well I'm sorry but
[1:53:30] that was yesterday
[1:53:32] you're crazy yeah I am praise the Lord
[1:53:37] hallelujah oh my well we're not gonna
[1:53:44] make it there hallelujah
[1:53:47] this boat hasn't got enough gas in it
[1:53:50] let's go back brother Ivan - then Jesus
[1:53:54] come and called Oh hallelujah
[1:53:59] now you know whatever Church soon is
[1:54:01] going to have to belong that World
[1:54:02] Council of Churches and when you do
[1:54:04] you'll forfeit your van Jellicle rights
[1:54:06] when you do that and if you don't then
[1:54:08] you can't be a denomination no more if
[1:54:11] you want to know about the groundwork of
[1:54:13] this Saints I'll just give you a quick
[1:54:14] lesson on this right now under the
[1:54:17] Internal Revenue Code in the United
[1:54:20] States a church is sovereign and
[1:54:23] requires no permission for the
[1:54:24] government we do not have to tell them
[1:54:27] what we've done where we've done it or
[1:54:29] how we've done it but Satan being so
[1:54:33] clever he come along and they wrote a
[1:54:37] code called 501c3
[1:54:39] and then they come as it were to the
[1:54:42] churches and said we'll allow you to put
[1:54:44] your name on billboards in the course
[1:54:46] the internet didn't exist when this is
[1:54:47] written but you know the internet and
[1:54:49] everywhere else if you'll just sign up
[1:54:51] and be a 501c3 and they said you mean we
[1:54:57] can we can then go to corporations
[1:55:00] you see we as a church cannot solicit
[1:55:04] but now as a 501 C 3 you can solicit we
[1:55:08] could go to corporations and say now
[1:55:10] we're a little Church over here but
[1:55:11] we're doing this work and this is
[1:55:12] happening here and this here what would
[1:55:13] you give us and they'll write big checks
[1:55:15] it happened Saints but did you know that
[1:55:18] by signing up to be a 501c3 they limited
[1:55:21] your voice and they do it anyhow because
[1:55:28] the church is more worried about getting
[1:55:30] their hands on something else and so we
[1:55:39] can't talk about politics or what's
[1:55:40] wrong with our government we cannot talk
[1:55:43] about social issues lest we be censored
[1:55:47] we cannot even
[1:55:50] as it were ask someone to not inhabit or
[1:55:54] Church you violated all the rules well I
[1:56:02] will put in perspective if you had
[1:56:04] somebody decided they wanted to come and
[1:56:06] be a belly dancer in our four year every
[1:56:08] Sunday morning and we're 501c3 we
[1:56:11] couldn't ask them to leave because
[1:56:13] they're expressing their religion and
[1:56:19] the majority of churches in the United
[1:56:21] States have signed up for that well
[1:56:24] praise the Lord and when you do you'll
[1:56:27] forfeit your evangelical rights see many
[1:56:31] of them have already joined and don't
[1:56:32] even know it they won't stand on the
[1:56:35] Word of God less they'll lose status
[1:56:38] unless they'll find themselves in a
[1:56:41] repercussion because every denomination
[1:56:44] has come into it you read of it it's
[1:56:47] just the same as I have it's a darkest
[1:56:48] hour the little church ever had
[1:56:49] everything has went out for Pentecost
[1:56:52] awake yourself up and right in the
[1:56:54] darkest of hour then here comes Jesus
[1:56:57] along to vindicate he is with you he is
[1:57:00] here see the darkest of our I heard a
[1:57:03] little story just take a minute to tell
[1:57:05] her the woman was called a County come
[1:57:07] to look at her cuz she was
[1:57:08] poverty-stricken she had a son and he'd
[1:57:10] went to India some time ago and he a
[1:57:13] very nice friend a fine boy and so the
[1:57:14] woman just got so without food and
[1:57:16] everything until the county had to come
[1:57:17] and investigate for County food for her
[1:57:20] and when they was there the man said
[1:57:21] well don't you have any loved ones to
[1:57:23] help you she said oh I have a son said
[1:57:25] what does he do oh he's an electrical
[1:57:28] engineer in India well who is he working
[1:57:30] for United States government why don't
[1:57:34] he help you said well well he doesn't
[1:57:36] help me but well well so why don't you
[1:57:39] ask him instead of calling the county
[1:57:41] she said well he's such a sweet boy he
[1:57:43] writes me such sweet letters and he said
[1:57:45] I you know I love him but I can't tell
[1:57:47] him I'm gonna need like this I said he
[1:57:50] writes you letters and you hear from him
[1:57:52] and everything yes and he still won't
[1:57:53] help you said no but he sends me some of
[1:57:58] the prettiest pictures you ever seen in
[1:57:59] my life
[1:58:00] so the man said let me see some of the
[1:58:02] pictures she said all right
[1:58:04] sir I've got them right here in the
[1:58:05] Bible and she opened them up and began
[1:58:07] to bring them out you know what they was
[1:58:09] money orders from India with pitchers
[1:58:12] they all got pictures you see money
[1:58:14] orders
[1:58:14] she had thousands of dollars but just
[1:58:17] didn't know what she was worth it was
[1:58:19] all hid in the Bible now that's a sweet
[1:58:25] little story my brother and sister I've
[1:58:27] heard people criticize that well I don't
[1:58:28] even think that's true it's just made up
[1:58:29] well I don't care if it's made up if it
[1:58:35] was made up and you don't get the point
[1:58:40] come on listen don't worry about whether
[1:58:43] it's made up or not don't you get the
[1:58:44] point
[1:58:46] hallelujah some people are so caught up
[1:58:49] just being a critic they can't even get
[1:58:50] the point but look at this my brother
[1:58:53] and sister he said it was real I'll just
[1:58:55] I'm going to believe it and I get the
[1:58:57] point it's all here right here in the
[1:59:00] Bible amen we don't need somebody come
[1:59:02] and kind of give some other
[1:59:03] interpretation out here we don't need
[1:59:05] some guy to stand on the mountain and
[1:59:06] say I've got an answer and we don't need
[1:59:08] to be mr. Santiago down there and in
[1:59:10] Central America
[1:59:11] that's got all these thousands of people
[1:59:13] following him he uses the message as the
[1:59:15] bait to get him in and turns him into
[1:59:17] workers on his farms lovely if we're
[1:59:19] gonna do that I've got an opening for
[1:59:21] all of you tomorrow
[1:59:24] since Saints nonsense we're not here for
[1:59:27] this we're here to get people to Jesus
[1:59:30] Christ amen but the problem we have is
[1:59:33] we see a lot of pretty pictures but we
[1:59:36] don't see the value that's a good story
[1:59:38] that's a good analogy that's a good
[1:59:40] dispel my brother's sister there's value
[1:59:42] here and it's in our Bible hey man
[1:59:45] he says now look at this I just don't
[1:59:47] know what she think I thought the
[1:59:48] pictures see money orders she had
[1:59:50] thousands of dollars just didn't know
[1:59:51] what she was worth it was all hid in the
[1:59:54] Bible
[1:59:54] I wonder tonight if Jesus wouldn't
[1:59:56] reveal to us what's hid in this Bible
[1:59:59] for us we're rich in His grace in his
[2:00:01] mercy and I wonder if he would come and
[2:00:03] call for us hallelujah look Saints I
[2:00:06] know I say this I applied to myself I'm
[2:00:09] not being down on you but I'm starting
[2:00:12] to come to conclusion we don't have a
[2:00:14] clue what God has given
[2:00:20] I'm sorry sounds like I think you're not
[2:00:23] spiritual I don't mean it that way
[2:00:25] I think it is so far above and beyond
[2:00:28] what we comprehend that we can't
[2:00:33] comprehend it God help us open up our
[2:00:37] Bible Lord and let us see what we're
[2:00:40] worth
[2:00:40] how do though your sister and me would
[2:00:42] you come amen oh I'll tell you my
[2:00:48] brother and sister I've taken quite a
[2:00:51] bit of time can I just can I just draw a
[2:00:53] look one more here amen second one
[2:00:59] hundred can I say I lied to you and I
[2:01:06] need to the Shekinah glory manifests him
[2:01:11] it brings forth the word of promise
[2:01:12] right out to you that's the reason that
[2:01:15] he had to veil Moses face because in him
[2:01:17] was the word he veiled Jesus as a humble
[2:01:19] little man to keep them from seeing
[2:01:21] Jehovah he veils himself today in
[2:01:23] earthen vessels with the Chicana the
[2:01:26] outside looks like a bunch of holy
[2:01:27] rollers old badger skins but the inside
[2:01:29] hides the Shekinah glory listen I like
[2:01:33] this right here
[2:01:34] and it ripens the shewbread that we can
[2:01:37] feast on and drive across the country
[2:01:39] for hundreds of miles see it's a
[2:01:41] believers food it's only for the
[2:01:43] believer now you know what the critics
[2:01:46] would say see he's saying it's only for
[2:01:48] message believers you just said believer
[2:02:00] it's up to us whether we narrow that
[2:02:01] down I'd say our four know more but
[2:02:05] there's quite a bit more than four of us
[2:02:08] so we'll just have to say it's only for
[2:02:10] grace tabernacle and no one else that
[2:02:13] won't fly either well look the western
[2:02:17] United States is a much nicer place than
[2:02:19] the eastern United States so maybe it's
[2:02:20] only for us in the West that won't fly
[2:02:24] either maybe it's only for the believer
[2:02:32] which is just exactly what he said it's
[2:02:35] for the believer
[2:02:37] remember the shoe bed was only for
[2:02:39] believer only see shoe bed scene notice
[2:02:42] what it does the Shekinah glory over the
[2:02:44] shewbread kept it from spoiling
[2:02:46] remember the mana that came from heaven
[2:02:49] it stayed on this kind of glory from one
[2:02:50] generation to another outside it got
[2:02:52] wiggle tails overnight contaminated is
[2:02:55] that right outside of the Chicano glory
[2:02:57] the days of miracles past see it's all
[2:02:59] fanaticism but inside look they got some
[2:03:01] sunflower seed they've also got some
[2:03:03] wheat seed I'll just tell you because
[2:03:05] this come up in one of my farm magazines
[2:03:07] here recently and they got some
[2:03:09] sunflower seed out of a garner in Egypt
[2:03:11] that was put in there in the days of
[2:03:12] Joseph 4000 years nearly ago Joseph put
[2:03:15] them in the garner they planted them
[2:03:16] they lived why they had life
[2:03:19] Alleluia they just did that out of Egypt
[2:03:21] there they found some other tunnels and
[2:03:23] stuff and in there they found actually
[2:03:25] quite a quite a little supply of wheat
[2:03:26] and they took that and took some of that
[2:03:29] wheat and this is what's funny because
[2:03:31] it drives you a good point home they
[2:03:34] took some of that wheat seed and they
[2:03:36] planted it and now they're trying to
[2:03:38] gene trace it right that's modern times
[2:03:40] they're trying to drink gene trace it
[2:03:42] because without it being hybrid it out
[2:03:44] produced the wheat that they were
[2:03:46] comparing it to well hallelujah I'm just
[2:03:51] going to call it quits here we'll just
[2:03:52] have to finish this another day look you
[2:03:55] can hybrid this message all you want but
[2:03:58] it's not going to out produce that
[2:03:59] original seed we can build it bigger
[2:04:02] better finer fancier whatever it is
[2:04:06] people are like well this church has
[2:04:09] this many people in it that church has
[2:04:10] that many people in it and I've been
[2:04:12] church services my brother and sister
[2:04:15] where there was just a bear half a dozen
[2:04:16] people and the power of God come down
[2:04:18] and shake the building so we can shake
[2:04:21] the building with our voices because we
[2:04:23] sing so loud or we can shake building
[2:04:25] with the power of the Chicana glory
[2:04:28] but a hybrid message will never outshine
[2:04:31] the original see hallelujah Oh
[2:04:34] hallelujah well forgive me we'll come
[2:04:37] back to this we'll come back to this and
[2:04:39] another service because this just goes
