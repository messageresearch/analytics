earlier that it's your face that we want to see not knowing what this title was this morning Lord but how perfect you are in bringing that song and then behind that sweep over my soul lord because we realize that what's in our soul is the reality of who we are this outer man can have all kinds of feelings and Sensations and everything but Lord that inside of the inside that seed Gene of God that's been quickened it's the new creation is of another Mother Nature that's the Eternal Lord that's our position now Lord may you open the word to us individually this morning unite us as we lord are your workmanship and we're created we are a spoken word seed word created Lord we are created in Christ Jesus unto good works which you have before ordained other words Lord you have purposed it yourself that we would walk in them so we thank you for every trial every test everything we go through and many times don't understand it but we know one thing you're working your purpose and Lord we give you praise for that that's not a negative anymore that's a positive because you know what it takes and you're dealing with us perfectly as you have purpose to do so and we thank you for this great peace

thanks an opportunity here to receive from you may you move out of our thoughts anything now that would hinder us from receiving from you Lord forgive us of our iniquity and our failures and our

thank you God bless you yeah I sang that song I'll give you my title in just a moment and you'll realize that song had to Be Sung it's good to be in the house of the Lord this morning are you thankful can you say Amen it's good to be in the house of the Lord you know you couldn't have come here unless God brought you here Satan wouldn't have want you to come to hear the word this morning he probably tried to do everything he could to hinder you but here we are how' we do that by faith amen so here we are this morning in the presence of God to receive from him what you have need of you believe he'll meet your need he said he would amen he said I'll supply all of your need that's not just natural needs that's spiritual need amen blessed be the name of the Lord amen if you turn with me in your Bibles it's good to stand before the the elect cuz I I know the elect have an ear to hear the word yes so in 2 Corinthians chapter 3 I just read this first I wasn't going to read this first but the Lord changed my mind just before I came out here and said read that scripture first I'm going to read a portion probably come back to it again in 2 Corinthians 3 but starting with the 16th verse well I'm going to take the third verse also with that okay chapter 3 verse three for so much as you are manifestly declared to be the Epistle of Christ that's the word of Christ ministered by US Written not with ink but with the spirit of the Living God Amen now I speaking to you this morning I want you to receive this message individually I want you to see it God wants you to see your great Victory individually I don't care about your past or what you've been through we're talking about your Victory this morning amen over the past over mistakes over failures over everything amen I want you to I want I pray that God will reveal it to you personally amen amen for so much as you are manifestly declared he's speaking to you here you are is there any e ARs here manifestly declared to be the Epistle of Christ ministered by US Written not with ink but with the spirit of the Living God lord not in tables of stone but in the fleshly tables of your heart amen and such trust have we through Christ through God word not that we are sufficient of ourselves men to think anything is of ourselves but our sufficiency is of God I want to read that our sufficiency is of God your sufficiency isn't through your reasoning and your abilities you have none humanly but sufficiency is of God Amen who God who hath made us able ministers you didn't make yourself that you couldn't make yourself that he made you that who hath made us able Ministers of the New Testament not of the letter but of the spirit right for the letter everybody has the letter mhm but they don't have the spirit of the letter you put the spirit and the letter together now you have Jesus Christ the same yesterday today and forever in flesh now you have true worship now you now you're moving you know what the message You' sent to do I like that song going home or longing for home you know you know what the message you've sent for for your going home the message of the seventh a was for your going home amen amen so you could God has an eternal purpose and his eternal purpose will never never be defeated amen amen and you are under being his child you are under an eternal purpose that cannot be defeated and everything you go through is for the purpose of God ful fulfilling that purpose amen and you can rest in that and you can turn that thing around and realize that every trial and every test is for his Divine Purpose to be manifest in you and through you personally amen that's how positive the word is I don't care what you've gone through how it is what the past is God is asking you this morning he's going to turn your focus off of your failure and your mistakes and what others did and didn't do to where you're standing right now in Christ yes amen hallelujah that ought to be sufficient enough to drive every fear out amen that's right you have no fear of tomorrow you can have no fear of yesterday or what happened realizing that God has had full control over your life for all things work together for good to them that love God to them that are called according to his purpose amen God Amen so let's look at this again who hath made us able Ministers of the New Testament not of the letter but of the spirit for the letter kth but the spirit giveth life now I'm going to jump down here to verse 16 nevertheless when it shall turn he's talking about your heart nevertheless when it shall turn to the Lord the veil shall be taken away the veil that is hid him from you shall be removed that's right amen now the Lord is that spirit and where the spirit of the Lord is there is Liberty not bondage Liberty yes amen you are free amen never to be you can you not you you cannot come into Bond bondage you're free am amen amen the Lord absolutely loosed yes sir amen so God's going to take you away from looking at this your feelings and all of this and look at him he's going to turn your focus this morning amen amen those that are able to receive it and will believe it can have their focus literally turned to a joy unspeakable and full of Glory to no fear to no worry yeah because God has given us his word something has got to be absolute in your life where's your absolute lay where's the last word lay where's the final determination that you can lay yourself on it and say Amen you tell me where Faith takes this resting place where Faith Sanctuary is and I'll tell you that's your amen Faith takes its resting place in the unmovable Eternal Word of God that's Faith sanctuary and nothing absolutely nothing can defeat the revelation of the word amen I didn't know I was going to say all that but God help us this morning we're not here by chance we have come into His presence do you realize that here in his presence remember the prophet preached the message God presence of God unrecognized do we realize that we're in his presence do you realize that he has compl control has had always have had control over you because your heart desires to please him amen he sees that look at the people that have been been all through trials and everything but what are they doing they still went on and served the Lord why because that was where they belonged always and God knowing that amen has got to fulfill his purpose of his own purpose his own purpose in you he's got to do it you are under an eternal purpose bride you are under an eternal purpose amen I got a lot of freedom up here now to preach so let's rejoice and let's look forward to him God open your word to me reveal it is that right what pleases God faith without faith it's impossible to please him what is Faith it's Revelation and God more willing to reveal himself to you than you're willing to receive it do you realize that God help us God be with us I'm so beside myself right now I don't even know I just say God here I take this vessel speak what you want to speak you know the heart of every individual in here nothing is hid do you believe that there's not one thing hid there's not one thing you can think in your mind that's hid there's not one thing you've done yesterday or day before or tomorrow he knows tomorrow he can tell you what was he knows what is and he's going to tell you rest in me you can enter into rest and you cease from your own labors you are delivered I pray that God will show you by the revealing of himself that you are absolutely totally delivered Hallelujah when it's turned to the Lord the heart has turned to the Lord the veils removed oh God then let us look Beyond the veil that's what he opened it for to let you see who you are to let you see where your position lays bride you have a positive position amen you have an eternal position that that Eternal never began and didn't end you were the thought of himself before the foundation of the world and you've come here for one purpose purpose that's to satisfy and fulfill his purpose because you are a part of him and here you are today himself revealed behind your skin Satan wants to do everything he can to keep that hidden from you but God's purpose for you must be fulfilled I don't care what you go through he's going to fulfill his purpose get you into that purpose and fulfill that purpose aren't you happy amen all right but we now the Lord is that Spirit where the spirit of the Lord is their Liberty you are not under bondage you may think you're bound you are not bound you are free amen I say that in the name of Jesus Christ by Divine authority to the bride that's standing here you are free in me Christ amen amen amen all right now watch the 18th verse but we all with what open face his face I see that song we just sang it all right whose face are you going to see Satan beat you down beat you down beat you down beat you down and again over your mistakes and your failures but in God's eyes you never one time have made them you never one time did it you were Justified you are Justified you never did it in the first place Glory something's going to happen here this morning there's Deliverance right here Among Us I'm telling you there's Deliverance we're not playing games we're not we're not here to play around let the politics go the way they are let the people go the way they want to I am delivered I am free and I'm walking with God Amen I don't care don't you look at your feelings now you look at the what the word said you look at the promise I'm walking with God Amen God's in me and I'm in him I'm eternally secured you believe that are you eternally there is a bride today that is eternally absolutely eternally secured does she make mistakes sure but her future is absolutely clear mistakes don't have nothing to do with it every mistake is ordained and God knew you would go through it and the prophet he did things that he disobeyed God did he suffer yes did he did he sow something he had to suffer but his salvation was certain and God allowed it to fulfill a purpose and bring him into his Divine Purpose God will allow you to go through very hard things to get you to get you in the place of his Divine Purpose for you and for his bride and brother and sister we can rejoice in that God would stop that Prophet from doing things and other things he would go on and let him do it how many know that's right M and he does the same thing with us Li you to go through something another times stop you and stop you from doing it other times lie you to go through it now either he's got control or he doesn't have control now let's face it right now this morning either he has or he hasn't over your life and he's got a purpose and all the he's not the author of frustration amen he has a purpose I Divine Purpose in allowing you to be where you are go where you go through and all that you've done and that is his eternal purpose for you and God will bring that purpose and get you in the position of that purpose to fulfill the purpose that he has called you in the body to be did you get that all right so we all with open face beholding as in a glass or other words as in a mirror right amen are changed what are we beholding the glory of the Lord are changed into the same image from glory to glory even as by the spirit of the Lord you can be seated my title this morning is open face open face amen so let's go to Ephesians chapter 1 Ephesians chapter 1 starting with verse three blessed be the God and father of our Lord Jesus Christ who hath hath that's past tense hath already blessed us with all spiritual blessings in Heavenly places in Christ according as he hath chosen us in him my chosen Us in him who is he he's Eternal is he not eternal life chosen Us in him before the foundation of the world that we should be holy and Without Blame before him in love having predestinated us unto the adoption of children by Jesus Christ to himself according to the good pleasure of his will what to what to the good pleasure of his will not yours to the praise of the glory of his grace wherein he hath made us accepted he has made us accepted are we accepted amen are you accepted where are you accepted in the Beloved already accepted in whom who the Beloved in whom we have Redemption through his blood the Forgiveness of sins according to the riches of his grace wherein he hath abounded toward us in all wisdom and Prudence what by his grace The Riches of the grace he ha abounded toward us in all wisdom and Prudence having made known unto us the mystery of his will according to his good pleasure which he hath purposed in himself amen that in the dispensation of the fullness of times this is where we're at he might gather together in one all things in Christ that's why the seals were open both which are in heaven and which are in Earth even in him in whom also we have obtained an inheritance Allelujah being predestinated according to the purpose of him amen whose purpose I want to ask you a question can his purpose fail if he purposes something can it stop can it fail no it's impossible for it to fail he already said what he would do according to his purpose what he has done for you according to his purpose that his purpose would be made manifest now doesn't he isn't he a sovereign and doesn't he have control over every member of his body to their purpose which he hath before ordained amen then cheer up you say everything's out of cater and nothing's out of cater it's all working according to his purpose depends whether you want to believe that or not amen but there's a bride that says amen I may not be able to explain it I may not be able to tell you but it's so it's so anyway I have it it's in me and it's working through me and I see it working through me despite how I feel amen despite how it works what it looks like how I feel how it reasons to be your humanity is not your absolute right amen your human reasoning your feelings is not what you're living by it's not your absolute amen amen that's right Satan will try to say it is but it can't be because by the scriptures I just read you're chosen in him by under a Divine Purpose to fulfill a purpose in him what he's going to fulfill himself that he had as his own thinking to be you here today in this hour amen amen all right so let's go over here to Isaiah 60 a very familiar scripture but one that can't be you can't you all these scriptures are just constantly becoming alive yes more and more and more arise shine Isaiah 61 60 excuse me chapter 60 verse one arise you know he calls for you do you know this morning he's calling for you and when and when Martha got the message that Jesus was the resurrection and the life she immediately went to her sister that was in the house and said to her the master calleth for you and the Bible said he went to her secretly it wasn't a public show the people thought one thing thought what she she'd going to do one thing and didn't know the message she had got the message the master calls for you and she arose up quickly and ran to go to meet him by the message of the final voice to the final age amen that's what Martha represented there's somebody's going to hear that voice and that voice is speaking this morning and is speaking in your heart and you are that voice yeah what are you what is the bride she's the message of the hour she's the final voice of the final age she is the Resurrection voice amen under her messenger is that right other words it's not another voice it's the manifestation of one voice being lived out amen all right so rise Shine for thy light thy light oh well that's not for me yes it is said thy if you're one of the Thy Thy light is come thy light is come am amen what you doing with it what is it doing in you it's put put the other way what's it doing in you is it leading you to further re Revelation is it is it directing you is it guiding you is is his word becoming alive to you the path of the Justice as a shining light that shineth more and more into the perfect day amen thy light has come do you realize thy light is come where is this light leading us taking us to a body change we sang about it right here this morning do you believe the songs are inspired amen thy light is come how we going to get home thy light is come how we going to how we going to have victory over this flesh thy light is come amen arise bride arise arise in what arise in the Victorious revelation of the Resurrection in you now amen rise amen rise up you Rose with him you're here to manifest him in this hour okay so arise Shine for thy light is come and the glory the glory the glory of the Lord how would God ever share his glory with anyone he doesn't share with anyone he tell will not share it with anyone but you're not anyone amen you are him bride you're him and he's got to share his glory with you amen because whatever he is you are that's right so his glory is going to be seen the glory of the Lord is risen upon thee so arise you have nothing to complain about you have nothing to murmur about why because you're chosen in him what do you have to fear when your life was ordained before the foundation of the world and every step you make is ordained everything you do is ordained nothing can happen by chance to a True Believer it's all ordered of God and the Bible said your let's let's just go over there just a minute I just read that that's the part I want to get to the Lord is risen upon thee and His glory shall be seen upon thee but let's go to Psalms a minute Psalm 37 let's look at this a second Psalm 37 and verse 23 and 24 I brother preached this and that just struck me and I I just have to share it with you you say are you going to share what somebody else is preach the message why certainly it's a body ministry right my goodness I love to receive it and love to pass it on but I have to pass it on how I've been ordained to in the body and he had to pass it the way he was ordained to in the body and each one have an ordained position and place in the body amen is that right who is the body you say well it's the bride but who's the bride Jesus Christ the same yesterday and today and forever oh well you make yourself God yeah that's right depends what side of the veil you're looking at this human man David is not God but that inside the inside is amen this has got to change to that amen but he has already provided for me a new body is that right already for who he justified declared righteous he's also glorified all right now okay let's go here Psalm 20 37:23 the steps of a good man are ordered by the Lord and he delighteth in his way yes amen right look at verse 2 3 24 though he fall who who who who wait a minute though he fall I thought you just said my steps are ordered of God how could I fall right yeah you're going to have mistakes and errors you'll probably go out of this service to stay and say something you didn't want to say do something you didn't want to do and God will tell you to do and you'll disobey it I'm not calling you unbelievers I'm saying this is the body this is the humanness the truth does God forgive yes he does he forgave you before you even he knew brother Ram said he knew when you made that mistake he had already forgiven you because he knew what was in your heart not to do it hallelujah thank you Lord think of that all right if you want to find that number 20 the quotation on uh it's a quote out of out of uh August 17th uh uh book three of the family altar if you have it read what the prophet said there amen oh yeah he said did Brother Ram make mistakes did he disobey God he did he disobeyed him when he could have God could have kept him from doing what he did with his mother-in-law right do you realize that yeah look how he kept him from shooting these boys look how he kept him from committing suicide right but he allowed him to go through that what for Brother David what for for a Divine Purpose to be manifest in his life he had to form him y bring him to that purpose that God had purposed in himself and the Bible said you were already chosen in himself now are you not under that purpose or are you under that purpose amen is that right all right so we see here though he fall the steps are ordered though he fall God allowed you to fall that's right amen amen you can say what you want to say but look at what else he says he allowed you to fall but then turned right around and though he he but but he shall not be utterly cast down right there it is he's only let you go so far because why because he upholdeth because because for the Lord upholdeth him with his hand do you realize you're in his hand nothing can happen unless he allows it nothing can come your way unless he allows it you're in his hand praise the Lord you're in his hand okay so let's go back over here now we read Isaiah 60 Maliah 4:6 you say Brother David those are very fundamental yes they are but how many realize malakiah 4 a minute and tie it with first 2 Corinthians 3 that we just read about he when it shall turn to the Lord when what shall turn to the Lord okay let's go over here to Malachi and we'll find out what's turned to the Lord now I'm sure you probably answer that before you get to it but we'll read it anyway malakiah 4:6 and and he shall turn the heart the what the heart of the children I'm reading the last portion of it he shall turn the heart of the children to the of the children to their fathers amen restore he's going to restore what the faith I want you to hold that not a faith he's going to restore perfect faith not in intellectual perfect there's only one perfect Faith that's God's own faith and if God's Own Faith to be God's own faith in you it had to be God in you amen he's going to restore that Faith who eternity What whose Hearts the children the seed he's going to turn the seed of God to the original faith of those fathers brother Ram said he would do two things the messenger of Malachi 4 Revelation 10 does two things he restores the mystery amen and reveals the seven Thunder what the seven Thunder said are you with me all right and then he said those Mysteries contained in those Seven Seals the mystery of those Seven Seals would literally turn the heart of the children to the faith of the fathers then without the seal being opened you could not literally be turned to the original Faith but now the fullness of that time has come and he's turning that faith of those children back to realize they're Gathering into where they're Gathering into the very personal revelation of himself in them and to the reality of who they are it goes right hand in hand together all right so it's Jesus now watch he said here and I'm going to read uh I'm just going to give you this quote here first paragraph 290 this is the fourth time I've taken this over the last four meetings every meeting I've had to read this why because God is trying to get the reality to his people I cannot get away from this it's real and it's becoming more real all the time to the Bride Watch what he says paragraph 290 of Christ's the mystery of God revealed it's Jesus Christ the new birth revealed in you am it's not another person right it's another mask but it's the same person it's Jesus Christ amen there it is right there there is your Victory there is your deliverance there is the the faith it's Jesus Christ the new birth revealed that's right Faith revealed brother brandom said this he said he says this here paragraph 68 of perfect Faith now the only thing you have to do then is have faith in what you are I just read to you what you are yes now watch this I'll go on with that quote he said it's Jesus Christ the new birth revealed unveiled revealed unveiled that's the open face all we with open face beholding is in a glass who we are who are we we are his glory we are himself and if it's himself in us his glory is risen upon us and that's what's in us that's who we are it's his glory he said that he has the pinenes it's revealed in you that he has the oversight preeminence means oversight the control the leading he has the oversight the preeminence is that he might Express Express his words what's the expression of words a thought spoken is the expression amen and the expression is when it's spoken it's made manifest so then he spoke he he expresses his words and anything that he promised in these last days he can bring it to pass through his body through what through his body is anybody here his body anybody that's the reality that's the Revelation that's your Victory that's already overcome the world that's overcome every mistake every failure you ever made or ever will make that's right you've got the victory if he's revealed in you you have the victory you have the position you are positionally placed and what a positive position it is I'll ask you this morning has Jesus Christ ever failed has he no then how can he in you that's right if he's in you his name is in you yeah amen then you are himself manifested in flesh amen and he can't fail his name didn't fail he spoke a word yesterday it never failed he can't speak a word today and it fail if he never failed there you can't fail that's right because that's the same person in you now his name is alive in you now his name is not an I was it's not an I was person it's an I am person amen hallelujah hallelujah all right it's the new birth it's Jesus Christ revealed unveiled in you the Open Face we're beholding as in a glass of with all with open face unveiled face other words the unveiling of you the real you has been unveiled yes amen you have to no wonder worry about it and wonder how it is you're going to you're going to have a carnal this outer man is going to be a carnal sticky nature as long as you're lived as long as you're in it until you're changed but you don't this isn't your guide this isn't how what you have and what your hope is in it's the revelation of Jesus Christ in you who Jesus Christ in you well it was Jesus Christ yesterday in that man yeah but it's Jesus Christ in you today in the bride form he's in morphate he come down and revealing himself in a full revelation of himself in a bride which is himself revealed amen that's it right this is the key this statement this quote right here is the whole key to you going home in a Rapture how can he not make how can you not make a Rapture when he himself the Rapture himself is in you how can you not be risen when the resurrection's in you how can you not make it when you are that Resurrection in life he's saying this is who you are the Bible says You must be born again then who's the new birth yeah where is this new birth who is it what Authority does does Jesus Christ have he has the same Authority he had yesterday but now he's doing it through a measure he's doing it through this measure this measure this measure but it's not the P it's still the same person every member of the body of Christ is one person in a different makeup other words if you're an eye you can't be an ear right but the eye and the ear are himself in a measure amen do you understand you can't take one another's place you don't have to take anybody's place just allow him to put you in his purpose and fulfill his purpose in you am you can't miss it it's impossible possible to miss it you see I might miss the Rapture it's impossible with that Revelation in you to miss it all you've got to do is believe who you are watch what the prophet said here he said believe the only thing you have to do then is have faith in what you are have faith in what the word says you are and Jesus had faith in the word of God that said what he was it's written of me do you realize this promisees these words are written of you for you are in him if it was written of him it's written of you and if it's written of you it's written of him yes amen what fools the people is that he's not the calvary man today that's not the body the flesh man he's you're his flesh man today but the spirit the person hasn't changed it's still himself amen are you with me not a different person it's the person amen and our faith is the victory that overcometh the world our faith amen now I am the Tree of Life from the Garden of Eden I am all these things I am that I am and he knew with that perfect faith that he was the anointed Messiah do you realize that you are that anointed Messiah today that's what he said perfect faith God pouring himself into her she's be there becoming one for the wedding supper and that same Spirit pouring himself into her makes you an anointed Messiah of this hour amen amen then where's the voice of God today where's the final voice where is the resurrection voice where is the shout where is it manifested well say it's all in him but where's he revealed in you that's right in you am let's go Beyond the Veil let's go beyond that last Veil into that little room that's where the union takes place that seed was was there that germ that was to be you was there that seed was there God sent his word to you he sent his word and delivered you amen it's what the Bible said 10 Psalm 107:20 he sent his word and delivered them from all their distresses from all their perplexities from all their all their all those things he has delivered you he has delivered you oh I wish I could be delivered all you need to do is die to yourself give over to him and you're set free amen but it takes death takes a dying daily it takes a dying for this word to be manifest I'm coming to it in just a minute because you're bearing in your body the dying of Jesus Christ every day you're bearing in your mortal body the dying of Jesus Christ that the life also of Jesus Christ also it's in you now also amen and so one has to die for the other to live and so you have to die to yourself take up your cross deny yourself daily take the word and follow that word follow that headship follow that leader and you say oh but I have Brother David have you what a beautiful thing it is to lay just to lay your life in his hands and say Here I Am Lord just use me now Lead Me Guide Me direct me in the way that you would be pleasing unto thee and then don't murmur no matter what the path is stay with it anyhow he's already made it known to you he said I will fulfill my purpose I will take you and allow you to go through this trial and that trial I'll I'll pull you out of something I'll stop you here and I'll let you go through it here who's sovereignly taking care of that who is doing that amen we can turn every trial every everything back to a positive and say thank you Lord your purpose is being fulfilled that you've ordained for me to stand in oh but if you're carnal now to be carnally minded is death if you want to follow your carnal mind it's emnity it's an enemy of God do you realize this outer man is the evil one that's right and here you are living behind the skin of an evil one that's right yes sir who's going to change it the power that's changed you that new birth inside of you has already been recognized and already realized that power in me will change my mortal body when God gets the Fulfillment of every member of that body in that position watch The Rapture watch the change take place I'm going to preach on that one of these times when I have next time on the revelation of the Rapture Lord willing I usually don't announce what I'm going to preach on but but I'm not going to go any further with that because brother Ram said the bride is looking for the revelation of the Rapture amen all right now but look what he said now don't murmur no matter what is stay with it and God will work it all right the footsteps of the righteous is ordered of the Lord and he said and that's the truth though he fall oh my brother now God yeah God could keep you from falling and he has many times and he allows you to fall allows you to make mistakes I've had him do things and say things I disobeyed say I'm never going to do it again and disobey it again and disobey it again I've had things I've had things happen to me that were strange and unusual couldn't understand why it was all happening I made decision to leave something when I shouldn't have left it that's right I made a decision to leave the pastorship when I shouldn't have gone oh well now Brother David you sined no I didn't God's already taken care of that he allowed it for a purpose to get me and fulfill his purpose he allow you to go through the hardest and the strangest things for a Divine ter purpose that he himself purposed for you in that body now that's scripture you can go back David look at what David did did he kick him out and say you're out of here nope he allowed David to go through it what for a Divine Purpose look at all these other things and yeah you're going to suffer for it you're going to seow you're going to reap that doesn't do away with it but you're never going to be lost you're already sealed in so God is working it I hope you get this I could we could just take a lot more time on it but that Divine Eternal purpose of God must be fulfilled and he's going to do whatever he knows to do sovereignly to get you in that purpose of himself it's himself working through you to bring you into that purpose and you've got to fulfill it before you leave here right whoa that's pretty good isn't it you mean God be that perfect oh yes yes now so the footsteps the righteous are ordered and every one of us is given a different temperament well I don't like your temperament and you don't like mine but God gave me that temperament and and will work his own life and his own truth through my temperament do you realize that oh well you see he doesn't have love how come how do you how do you how do you say what love is it's either F or agape and agape love is beyond your reasoning and beyond your ability to even produce it but aelio love is human and many people will look at they they don't have love because they do this and they do this brother sister listen I could tell you where the Lord himself looked upon them with anger and braided cords and whipped them out of that Temple upset their cages and you tell me that was and it was that was love oh we we walked through two 2,000 people by the pool of Bethesda in love divine love and went to one man when there was Halt and and blind and naked and and and and sickness and diseases all around him he could have said to the whole group arise and be healed but he went to one man so what is perfect love you see what I'm saying it goes be because I'll tell you who it is it's a person and when that person lives in you and abides in you you are in love with God because God loved you first he loved you first or he couldn't have put his holy spirit in you and identified you as being in that love amen now that's as perfect as it is I can say then why can't we relax and rest in the rest of how else he delad and guides us well Brother David I just don't understand he never said for you to understand it he said Do you believe what I've said quit trying to explain it try to reason with it the devil can wrap you around the pole through his reasoning right and he does and every one of you in here know he does that he does but God's bringing you up to your position in place and and showing you this is where your Victory is this is who you are this is what you're depend on this is your focus yes amen hey amen amen amen that's the focus that's what he wants you to see he said he said now I in myself he knew that with perfect Faith he was anointed Messiah that the spirit of God was upon him do you realize that the prophet said this when the word is revealed to you it's perfect faith that cannot fail that's a direct quote he said when that word is revealed to you personally revealed to you it's perfect faith that cannot fail then I just said what is revealed to you who is this new birth it's revealed he said it's revealed it's revealed Jesus Christ the new birth is revealed in you and if he can't fail yesterday he can't fail today if that name didn't fail yesterday he can't fail today and if he didn't fail yesterday how are you going to fail today you say I you just said I did fail but there's an inner man that can't that's who he's pointing you to now is that inside of the inside that cannot fail that's already resurrection and life that's the person Christ the same yesterday and today and forever amen amen amen all right but watch now I myself do nothing what's Jesus saying here I can do nothing in my own self as the father worketh I work as my father worketh hither to I work the same Harmony will exist between him and his bride you are the veil that hides him you are the skin that he that he's hid behind the human Veil is the skin he's hid behind or I should say you're hid behind Okay now so he says right here now the only thing you have to do now he said I myself do nothing but it's my faith in God and God was in him hello the word made manifest and when the word of God God comes in you when the word of God is Manifest in you you are a Believer what's the evidence of believer the word manifest in you revealed in you now watch he said you are a Believer and see he said a Believer is the faith of God see a Believer is the faith of God what's the faith of God perfect Faith what is Faith Revelation then a Believer is the revelation of God in you moving in you that's the believer my what a Believer my what a Believer the believer see now amen some of this I'm going to stop and I'll finish up another time that seed that's been quickened in you is Jesus Christ revealed that Royal seed he was the royal seed he still is the Royal seed and the bride is the Royal seed of him it's it's all one and the same person in another mask he wanted to become he had in his heart to have a bride and that bride would be him in fact Adam said it was that woman there come from me and she's me and God said the same thing your bone of his bone flesh of his flesh and you're him other words he's saying you're me you were created in Christ Jesus under good works Eve was created in Adam amen is that right Eve was created in Adam he was both male and female hey yeah who is this bride she's a spoken word seed created and what is that spoken seed that word seed the original so where's the message I believe a message do you believe a message I believe the message is made flesh today amen and I believe this may choke some of you but I believe I am that message made flesh amen what about you amen who skin what where does who who owns your body who's quickening your body right who's bringing it under obedience to that word then follow him amen follow him amen you have the faith in you we have the same faith Amen on one side we're dying the other side is living amen dying to ourselves that he can be lived and made manifest that he can be manifest through us so I hold this treasure in Earth and vessels that the power is not of my Earth and vessel the power is of him the Revelation is of him amen it's not of us it's him all right and then that same God that spoke light to come out of Darkness has revealed himself in me and brought me face to face with the reality of Jesus Christ in me then how can I fail how can I fall how can I come to nothing I can't he will see to it and I'm not saying just I I'm talking about I when I say I talk about you also amen you can't come to not now some will hold that and some won't I'm talking about a revelation I'm not talking about your intellectual knowledge and yeah oh yeah I believe it yeah but I'm talking about a real unveiling the real unveiling of himself in you is that new birth is and that birth lays in the presence of the Sun and is ripened for over 60 some years right now as each one come in they had to lay in that presence lay in that presence lay in that presence what's happening we're realizing that's me amen that's me okay I'm going to I'm going to stop I'll pick this up later but he sent his word and the Bible in Matthew 25 in Matthew 24:27 said or 2437 excuse me heavens and earth will pass away but my word shall never pass away and the prophet said if you be that word and you become the word as you receive the word and if you in me and my word in you abides in you ask what you will it shall be done done time space nothing else will ever change it you know it's done amen amen it's over with every it's done everything will pass away heavens and earth will pass but that word won't if we be that word the Earth will pass from beneath us but we can never pass away because we are that word he's the word what does it make the bride you see the mystery revealed that's me Mama the full mystery the final mystery the finished mystery here he is stand the day unrecognized his coming is unrecognized it's going to be too late when she's caught up to meet those others because that mystery is his coming and it's unfolding only in the bride that's right where is it where is Jesus Christ today he's in the formation of his bride that's right I'm just going to have to really lay it out again I'm not talking about somebody else I'm talking about Jesus Christ amen you're predestinated in the word just like he was you come from the father just like he did you come from the same source that he came from amen that's right amen when he come to the fullness of the godhead body you were there in him then when he died and went to Calvary you died with him you paid sin in his body when he rose again you Rose with him it is over it's finished and when he reveals himself and you you're identified that you always were in him brother sister what do we have to fear that's right you tell me you tell me we have nothing but life I preached that last time here imparted through the body amen that's it what we're speaking here this morning is life to the body oh there's that's the message of the hour the message of the hour is life it's eternal life that's right it's Christ who's in the picture where's The Headstone who is that headstone where's what form is The Headstone in it's he The Headstone then who's the head of the body and they are one he can't s on something else it's word coming to word it's his word coming to his word it's Life coming to life amen you were predestinated to receive that life that germ was in him before the foundation of the world found you today that spoken word was The Germ that found you yes amen that's it I've been found the Lost has been found in school I always had lost and found or no no was had they had a lost and found but I like to show what was lost is now found that's what we're doing today the Lost is now found it's been found amen but you realize he couldn't do the full Redemption until he took that book and opened and claimed his own people do you realize that's exactly what's happening he's claiming his own amen there's a people today that literally is Walking with God and they don't care about what they people think and what they don't think it's not that we don't care but brother sister what I think about is my focus that's on him while I look not at the things which are seen see how he've been talking of that right here we don't look at the things which are seen quit looking at your failures and mistakes and I feel this and I feel that and I feel who are you trying to impress why don't we just come back and say I'm one of them I have everything is all well everything's well all is well well you say Brother David how can I say that be telling I know you're not you're telling the truth because everything you go through is controlled and directed by him and if he takes if he takes you through it all you can do is say thank you Lord amen in all things give him thanks because this is the will of God concerning you what you're going through is the will of God concerning you at that moment what you're going through is God controlled you said I know I'm one of them then he's revealed himself in me then what are you fretting over right the Bible said in your little Dash you've got from the time you're born till the time you leave in that little Dash the Bible said fret not yes rest in the Lord yes commit yourself to him rest in him and let him do what he wants to do to bring you to his provided place and his purpose amen and he will do and he can't miss it it can't be stop it can't be defeated so all you can do is say praise the Lord give him thanks Rejoice always and again I say rejoice turn with me to Hebrews and I'm going to close with that remember and I'll come into this later but you are Justified Justified means the word the word hold this real carefully now the word Justified doesn't mean you're forgiven I'm not saying you're not brother Bram said the same thing he said it's not that doesn't mean you're forgiven they'll say well Justified means I'm forgiven brother B said no that word does not mean you're forgiven right he said Justified means you never did it in the first place other words he's recognized you his thought just like he recognized Jacob his thought before either boy did good or evil it was the thought that God saw Jacob was the seed and the seed was God's thought expressed right and you were in his thinking as substance what am I talking about here when I talk about the believer is the faith I'm saying that the believer is the substance of God the believer is the substance of God the faith of God that moves in you it's a person it's not a feeling it's a person unveiled it's a person amen you say Brother David don't you have anything else to preach about no because this is taking us home amen amen amen there's a bride maturing in that very person till her and the and the person they're not saying why he's this and I'm no it's the same right here this morning standing here and sitting here is god with skin on him all right Hebrews chapter 12 so you're Justified meaning you never did it in the first place we'll go into that we'll show what profit because he declared my message to you bride is that you're Justified and you're perfect and you're virtuous and you're sinless and there's a people out here saying I don't know I don't believe that he just doesn't know what I've been through you don't know what he went through that's right why he he disobeyed God and went with those men in South Africa and what kind of problems did he have come home with omba and everything else is that right listened to his mother-in-law and what' that happen took his wife took his daddy took his brother took his daughter yeah don't tell me he didn't suffer but why it was God yeah yeah moving that Prophet molding that Prophet into his purpose and I want you to look at that yourself when you go out of here and realize you have one thing to Rejoice over that you're in him amen and that he's in you and let him guide you and Lead You by yielding completely surrendering your life to him and give over to him Hebrews 12 verse one I want to show you how you need to run this race wherefore seeing we also are are have a ALS excuse me wherefore seeing we also are compassed about with so great a cloud of witnesses other words Revelations 11 the witnesses of faith is that right Revelation all right wherefore seeing we are wherefore Paul's saying where for because we're seeing such a great cloud of witnesses then let us lay aside every weight does so easily beset us and let us you say Brother David do I have the authority to lay aside every weight you do yeah and you have the discerner in you to discern what that weight is and what needs to be let go of he'll teach you will not the teacher being an inside teacher teach you how you must walk and what you must do will he not bring you as to what is his Divine Purpose he will bring you to manifest his very character that's his purpose I think we just settle it right there that's his purpose to get you to react as he reacted do as he did in those situations and bring you into the character even what what else to forgive when you've been stepped on that's his character yeah to forgive let go of release because all that unforgiveness does is bind you true amen it doesn't release you it binds you you hold grudges you hold bitterness let go of it right he did where's his character UND display today it's in a bride the character of forgiving the character of love the character of all these things that he did he's allowing you to go things to teach you to mold you to bring you into his manifestation of his very character because it's him in you and he's got to manifest his character all right so lay aside every weight in the sin that does so easily beset us and run the race that is set before us with patience oh with patience run with patience so run with patience the race that's set before you looking to who looking unto Jesus the author and the finisher of your faith of whose faith our faith who's going to who's the author of it who began it he that began a good work in you will also do what finish it can you rest in that sure you can he's in you all right the finisher of our faith the author and the finisher he that called I I've I've always come back to this he that called me will also do it amen Faithful Is He that calleth you who also will do it amen now why don't why don't we just put everything in his hands and let go oh I I've got to I've got to hold on to the FL I can't I I can't die to it I can't let go of it but you let go of it watch God live his life and what are we what are we to live what the just shall live by what his faith amen the just shall live by his faith looking unto Jesus the author and the finisher of our faith who for the joy that was set before him what now watch watch your attitude watch what you are to looking for the joy that's set before you was set before you endured the cross despising the shame and is sat down at the right hand of the Throne of God sure now you can go home and and read 2 Corinthians 4 starting with about verse eight to the End Amen so what's revealed what's in US where's the faith who are we that Revelation let's Stand Together we'll see maybe I can so your your position is recognized what is what are we speaking of here we're speaking of the revelation of Jesus Christ in this hour not what he was in another hour but what he is now the Bible expresses it's growing in the bride to the full stature there it is right there so what form is he in the formation of the Bride amen so that corn of wheat that the bride seed had to fall in the ground through the Dark Ages hid under the ground of denominationalism Amen that church that church he started and that dirt to bring forth again in the age of Luther come into Wesley come through Pentecost and now out into the full stature of the Bride of Jesus Christ for the last days has he turned your heart this little bride is a living Oracle amen displaying through the world the attributes of God Jesus could come back and say it's written of me so then recognize your position bride in the scripture as a believer I'm going this is the climax I'm closing right here so recognize your position in the scripture and as a real believer what is the believer the faith of God the substance of himself in you living moving moving meaning going forward progressing marching on Walking with God it's a moving it isn't standing still it's moving going right into a body chain marching to the step of the word then recognize your position in the scripture as a Believer see you've got to recognize your position as he recognized his position amen you become the word you become the word as you receive the word amen and it can't be defeated amen you might be accused but he that he called he justified and those that he justified he's already glorified so thanks be to God let's sing some songs will be dismissed I want to sing
