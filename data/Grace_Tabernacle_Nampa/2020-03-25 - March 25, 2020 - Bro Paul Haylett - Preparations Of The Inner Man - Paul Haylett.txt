21-day quarantine I guess everybody's a stay inside and the guys at work were a little upset about it don't knowing of insurance a little unsure teeth and I was talking to my lead hand yesterday he was a little unsure because we thought we had a case where two brothers were exposed to the corona virus so the guys were a little worried about that and come to find out that their parents had just had the common cold so we thank the Lord I had called my wife and I said honey would you just gather the children around just have prayer this is what's happening and so I went into myself I went into we have a little lean-to where we keep all of our consumables and I just bowed down on my knees took my hat off and I said Lord I said I need you to come on the scene watch over our shop or we've had this scare and I just I know your hand is upon us and it had just had a little word of Prayer so I was talking to my lead hand and he's all nervous and I just told him I said well and I had another my other Isaac Williams was there as well and I said well boys I said I went had to talk with a man upstairs I said so we I prayed over this place I'm not worried about it and he's he's in control and today I had another opportunity I don't know if any of you read the daily devotion devotionals that go out but they're talking about the Giants Satan puts a giant in front of your and my wife just texted me she says I don't know if you've read the read the devotional but I just want to encourage you you know yah God or Satan puts these Giants in front of you but God's in control and worried we can overcome these these giants and she gave me some scriptures and again my lead hands standing right there and I had Josh you know Josh and Isaac and I sent it to both of them and they're reading it and he's like what's a scripture well let me read me what a scripture is so I read what my wife sent me and and he's like wow so I always always told him I said when you become a Christian you'll

don't know and it's for a sham no no pie for the majesty and power of this kingdoms King has gone and this kingdoms reign and his kingdom through and this kingdoms power and authority Jesus God's

of the know and and its flourish and oh no bad for the majesty and power of this kingdoms King has gone and this kingdoms brain and his kingdom through and this kingdom power and authority Jesus God's righteousness [Music] well god bless you Saints we're certainly living in different times sometimes we just have to stop and almost pinch ourselves to realize this is the reality of the day that we're living in and the things that are happening around us but you know the beauty of it is that we are seeing the Word of God fulfilled right before our eyes and that is a wonderful thing because as the scripture declares that when Satan comes in like a flood that the Lord would raise up a standard and we're not looking for something to stop what is happening in this present world but the standard is being raised in the bride of Jesus Christ that she can stand upon the word and withstand it and as we look this evening into our thought I believe you'll enjoy the very closing quote that we will share tonight let's just stand to our feet if we would and turn to matthew the twenty-fourth chapter we're looking at a time here you'll just have to be patient with us as brother Jason has said the state has declared that they want all facilities closed down meetings to to not exist but we are just here believing this is what the Lord has called us to do to be able to encourage you while we can't gather together we can come together by this use of technology and so as we turn to Matthew 24 starting with the 21st verse we'll just go down to the twenty eighth verse were then shall be Great Tribulation such as was not since the beginning of the world to this time no nor ever shall be and except those days should be shortened there should be no flesh be saved but for the elects sake those days shall be shortened so God being mindful of us amen - to shorten the days then if any man shall say unto you lo here is Christ or there believe it not for there shall arise false Christ's and false prophets shall show great signs and wonders in so much that if it were possible and we have to always remember that portion of that verse if it were possible they shall deceive the very elect behold I have told you before wherefore if they shall say unto you behold he is in the desert go not forth behold he is in the secret chambers believe it not for his lightning cometh out of the east and Shina 'the even into the west so shall also the coming of the Son of man be for wheresoever the carcass is there will the eagle's be gathered together Heavenly Father we just thank you Lord for the opportunity to come and father while it might be by the use of technology father we can join together as saints of like precious faith and father the doors being opened Lord we just stand before you tonight just to speak your word we ask you Father to come and just give us unconfirmed the many needs that we have in the body have not gone away Lord since we are not together but father you are mindful of the needs of your children and we ask you to come tonight speak to our hearts may healing virtue flow Lord as we step forward father knowing that faith cometh by hearing a hearing of the word of God so were father we're looking tonight for a great increase in our economy father knowing that you are in our midst we thank you now in the name of Jesus Christ amen you may be seated you know it's very interesting as we would look at this to realize how the scripture has such an impact to some it is viewed as something judgemental many people say well you know don't don't judge me you know because the scripture says that you shouldn't judge but the scripture also shows us that we have to judge and so it's very interesting how the scripture can bring peace to one and fear to another now my brother and sister I believe it's just a lovely term that I have recently read and that says that purpose brings preparation so if we have a purpose we would then be prepared to fulfill or live out that purpose and I believe one of the first things as sons and daughters of God that we recognized and know what God has done as the prophet of God tells us that when we recognize who we are then is the time that we can become that invincible army so when we recognize who we are will recognize our purpose and to be able to live out the word in such a dark time in such a age of chaos a time that people are once again becoming afraid of the atomic reaction the atomic bomb and we're looking at the what they call superpowers and the friction that is there but my brother and sister we as sons and daughters of God recognize our purpose is to live the word for our day and so therefore we will be prepared to live that word we will not be sitting here just hoping for tomorrow but we can live with a certainty amen as we would look at verse 28 for just a moment I just want to bring this and how the beauty of this is in the scripture in verse 28 as we are looking it says for wheresoever the carcase is there will the eagle's be gathered together and I believe that's just a beautiful scripture because what it's speaking is to you and I my brother and sister that the the carcass is present the word has told us that that that will be present and so where the carcass is that's where you look to find the Eagles you don't go out here into the muck and the mire and the highway byway as it were in the filth of humanity and look for the eagle you look for the carcass you look for the bloody lamb the Word of God that was opened in our day and there's where you'll find Eagles you're not gonna find an eagle in the pub you're not gonna find them wandering the highways and byways as a bum but you're gonna find it that God calling out of those places brings together around the carcass of the bloody word the bloody lamb the Word of God and so there is something about that carcass that holds a supernatural attraction for a son or daughter of God now my brother and sister it's not just that we had no other Church or no other place to go but there is an attraction that God has placed in you just as it would be and that that metal would be attracted to a magnet we'll see how that the word for our hour is attracting of people now that word is not for everyone it as some people would be as a magnet upon aluminium or something of that nature there's simply no attraction but the bride of Jesus Christ has a supernatural attraction not just a man attraction not just a carnal attraction but a supernatural attraction and I want you to think of it my brother and sister there's something irresistible about the word to the bride of Jesus Christ she is not just hey I'm a Christian I go to church but there's something that's irresistible something compelling drawing her pulling her into the presence of God now it doesn't matter my brother and sister many people are concerned they'll say well this is just the start of our government controlling us and look how easy that is for them to shut everything down my brother and sister what it should be is us looking out there and saying this is something that should cause us to focus more intently on the things of God not something to to wring our hands and to be nervous and lose our sleep if we lose our sleep then let us lose it to prayer not to worry on cares of this life and but there's something about the word that is so irresistible my brother and sister now you see it is around this word of God that is attracting the Eagles it is not a social structure now my brother and sister they have phrased this thing's social distancing and whatnot you know how people just shouldn't get too close to others well my brother and sister the word says that we shouldn't be respecter of persons so take that in the natural we shouldn't become so close to someone that we fail to see it's Christ that we're following Amen due to distance ourselves from this world and to be drawn in the presence of God is what the world what the Word of God what what this gospel is all about so we don't have church because it gives us a social structure it does not we do not come to the house of God and put our time in reading our Bible and praying so that we can have a religious structure you see the pure Word of God is what attracts us amen and as we would look at our thought tonight the preparations of the inner man you see my brother and sister we can have all of the toilet paper we can have all of the water we can have all of the snack ramen all of the Campbell's soup we can have extra this and extra that but my brother and sister that's not what it's about on what we are here for is to come in the presence of the pure Word of God and to come into that and be fortified in the inner man because if we gain this whole world and lose our soul what have we gained nothing now my brother and sister I know sometimes when we talk this way that people got maybe get a little nervous but I want to just make this statement to you tonight you see there are voices in the land that are saying certain things and people are believing and going and thinking that way but I want to say this tonight that the quotes bring clarity to us and we need clarity but let's not mistake quotes which can be placed and ordered and structured in certain ways to say certain things let's not say that the quote by itself is the pure word the prophet of God or two hundred or so times tells us about going back to the word he speaks he sings in such a clarity and some today would say well you know focus on look to you know keep your eyes on on the message my brother and sister that's good but the message was pointing us to Jesus Christ and so let's just follow all that the prophet of God said and he said that this message was a representation of the Word of God for our hour and that this message my brother and sister the pure Word of God is God's message to this day now in the sermon the seal of the Antichrist brother Branham says here we need the old-fashioned gospel back in the church amen we don't need some new version we don't need a new modified version for Laodicea the end of the age kind of interpretation we just need the old fashioned gospel now the prophet of God tells us that the gospel is the life behind the word so we need to have some life back into the church he says now we need the old fashioned gospel back in the church Mac to the Word of God and a lot of this nonsense and foolishness cut off amen oh my around over the country the things that's done all my brother and sister I don't even want to get started on that things that's done here in our country something come in here not long ago and you can't even mention Pentecost around our country anymore on account of it you look at this and the prophet of God is talking about the nature or the behavior of the people that are claiming to be Christians now my brother and sister will touch on that in just a minute but you see we want to look at this that my focus are bringing this quote not to twist anything not to do it but the prophet of God saying we nina old fashioned gospel back in the church i say amen to that we need to go back to the word and a lot of nonsense and foolishness needs to be cut off amen this is how we prepare the inner man we cannot say hear and say well you know i just am a believer and so therefore I have no problems God will take care of everything my brother and sister remember for every action there is a reaction and so when the word of God is preached there must be a reaction amongst the people now the reaction may be that it will push some away but it will draw others closer I say Lord draw me close amen so as we look at this I want to just drop right down now into the message the seal of Christ you see that previous quote was out of the seal of the Antichrist so brother branham focusing back-to-back services he's focusing one on the seal of the Antichrist what was going to take place what the behavior the situation would be what it would produce but now the next evening he preaches on the seal of the Christ amen and so I say that's very relevant to you and I we're not going to be sealed we're not of the Antichrist we are of Christ amen I believe that every religion Amen or am i yet is there a little bit more of this brother I believe that ever religion every true religion is founded on this and if this if the religion doesn't speak of this then it's not right up here is God's only foundation the only truth that we can if anything is contrary to this word it's not the truth so you look at that and realize now when brother Branham was talking about contrary to the word it's not the truth he wasn't I can assure you holding one of his message books he was not speaking of himself he was speaking of this Bible my brother and sister and in this you look and realize if it's contrary to this word Amen it's not the truth you see so there is a preparation for the inner man that he will come to a time in a place that the pure Word of God now we we will take the pure Word of God as I said my brother and sister the quotes bring clarity that's what brother branham's ministry was for to bring a clarity of things that had been muddied and confused through the ages but he did not come to displace or replace the Bible he come to solidify the Bible as our anchor that we could come to that place that when we need help in the time of trouble and that we know exactly where to go you know questions do we go here under this ministry do we go here under this ministry we go back to the Word of God amen he said take everything back to the word now I know sometimes people think but brother Paul this is a redundant topic but my brother and sister when you look around and see how that people are leaning upon a certain ministry here they're leaning on a certain ministry here when the prophet of God showed us that these ministries true God called ministries will point to people back to Jesus Christ amen that is what it is amen now if a dreamer told the dream and it didn't flash on that Yoram Thummim it was wrong and now the devil taken a pattern of that and made one of those crystal balls but God still got his urine thumb and this is it I believe brother branham was holding up his Bible amen this is it that's right if any preacher preaches or any prophet prophecies or any dreamer dreams a dream that's contrary to this then it's wrong that's right it must come from the word I'm a great believer in the word can we say amen to that hallelujah that's what keeps us straightened out come back to the Word of God now you say brother Paul what's this why are you taking this my brother and sister but you must remember that as we are coming down to the end of time that Satan as we've read the scripture could come so close it would deceive the very elect then we realize that the only way that we will be able to discern or to separate that will take it back to a word by word position in this scripture and then when we compare that my brother and sister we're not talking about maybe the difference of a verbage you know somebody expressing it but to come down to the fundamentals must line up word by word and so what this is is not simply a church being prepper prepared to to look for the deceiver to look for the one who is bringing this in but there's actually a greater purpose we are not going to spend all of our time trying to figure out who's wrong but the Word of God is bringing us now brother Chris referenced here in one of his last services as he shared with us my brother and sister how that we're coming into a time we're coming into a place that the word is our absolute and I love that God's Word is our absolute amen so it comes back to the Word of God now we can pull pages back like this but there's only one who can open the book now you know you take that and many times you read that and and realize that when you see something in the Word of God when you see something in the Bible and in the message you must recognize that came from God that wasn't an intellectual understanding because if it's an intellectual understanding it will an intellectual result and her intellectual result will not get us in a rapture amen now we pull back the pages like this and there's only one who can open the book and that's he that come and took it out of the right hand of him that set upon the throne a lamb that had been slain from the foundation of the world none other but our Lord Jesus Christ the author of the word shall we bow our heads just a moment now to speak to him Amen that was in the seal of Christ now we understand very simple verbage here that the word is Christ and Christ is the word Amen John 1 settles this whole thing now my brother and sister you say brother Paul where is this preparation of the inner man coming my brother and sister it's by line upon line word upon word precept upon precept now the prophet of God says that we have either a practical out working where we allow that to to be built upon in our life or we are looking at that just as something to debate and analyze now my brother and sister if a man would tell you that this is not talking about God building up a spiritual house in you and I then that man views that simply as something to analyze and agree or disagree not looking for the actual change that the whirlings we're looking for the change not looking to debate it not looking to argue over these certain points but to realize that the practical these are brother branham's words the practical outworking of the word in our life my brother and sister is going to bring a change in our life you want to look that up you can Amen outworking amen so you look at that will see my brother and sister that this word what is doing is sealing us in or sealing us out that is what's happening in the day that we're living in and you know you have to look very closely and and I'm trying to keep from jumping ahead of myself because there are several thoughts that we have attached to this now it says my brother and sister in verse 24 for there shall arise false Christ's and false prophets and shall sew great signs and wonders in so much that if were possible they shall deceive the very elect you see we have a lot of people around the message right Satan wants to infect us with the virus of fear and when he can infect us with the virus of fear then we will become afraid of everything around us actually Satan even desires to impact us to the place that will actually be afraid to enter into the holiest of Holies afraid to step beyond the veil into the presence of God study that the prophet of God speaks on it my brother in spirit that is what fear will do it will paralyze us and under that paralyzing effect of the virus of fear we as sons and daughters of God will be afraid to trust God and take him at his word so it's not just about what will attack or affect the human body or the outward man but Satan's desiring to bring that same effect upon the soul now my brother and sisters so many are afraid that someone will come and somehow they will be victimized now certainly there is in the world of Christendom many people been victimized by many things but remember if we will take it back to the word and judge every ministry and every situation by the word then we don't have to worry about being led off into the jungles and poisoned hallelujah come on so you look at that don't be afraid that you're going to be victimized my brother and sister when someone comes and presents you something you take it back to the Word of God and when you take it back to the word it either passes the Urim Thummim or it doesn't and if it doesn't have courage to stand up and say this doesn't pass a word test don't be meek don't be a sheep in that sense and just sit there and say well maybe I don't get it it lines up with the word if it doesn't it's not right amen so we can spend a lot of time brother Chris kind of touched on this to a degree we can spend a lot of time nervously guarding ourselves we can be spending a lot of time looking around afraid of what might be said or what might be done and as we do that we can then spend a lot of time preaching about what's wrong here and what's wrong here but my brother and sister forget that nonsense let's dig into the Word of God spend our time in the word until it becomes our very life amen when it becomes our very breath when it becomes our very thoughts of the day when it becomes our actions amen when it becomes our reaction to our situation my brother and sister when we have become it it will have become us amen and so then we don't have to look out here and say what is this this is conspiracy to take over overthrow my brother and sister there's been a conspiracy since Satan was throat Lucifer was thrown out of heaven Amen there's been a conspiracy the whole time we're not worried about it my brother and sister God already said Satan you're defeated our job is to believe the word and stand on it and when we prepare ourselves to simply say there's no other option but standing on the Word of God then a lot of these things that we struggle with will just go right on bias people say well don't you notice that oh yes I noticed they're now trying to replace the dollar with something electronic I know that they've got this and I know that they've got that but what is that got to do with me hey man if I'm filled with the Holy Ghost and I'm ready to go in a rapture what has that got to do with me the prophet of God speaking in the church age book in the dark ages how that they come to that time in the place that the church thrived under persecution it was at that time that they relied and called upon God and sought his face and the church flourished even though the numbers brother Branham says the numbers of the martyrs was rising the numbers that gave their life for Christ was rising the church grew stronger because there was pressure upon him and if it takes pressure my brother and sister to get you and I ready for a rapture then let's stop and say Lord what will it take for me to have preparation for my inner man to be ready for that day for that time for my calling amen you see when it becomes our very action in reaction my brother and sister will no longer be us but it will be the mind of Christ in us that gives us direction and moves us forward hallelujah you know we speak of this of being you know deceived if it were possible my brother and sister making light or I'm not putting that down it is of a great concern because even in the realms of the message there are men who would say well the Prophet said this but it's not what the Prophet said there would be those that would try to take away what the Prophet said because it conflicts with their position my brother and sister the scripture says that if they add to or they take away my brother and sister that they would be taken from the book their name be taken from the book of life so we're not looking for men who by a clever craftiness have preached a message to try to draw people but my brother and sister let them and I say this to myself also let them prove it by the gospel let them prove it by the Word of God and if it's there we will stand upon it amen so you know what my brother and sister I believe there's another side to deception which this is my basis of my real fought tonight and James 1:17 2:27 and starting with verse 17 every good gift and every perfect gift is from above and we can say amen to that and cometh down from the Father of lights with whom is no variableness neither shadow neither shadow of turning of his own will begat he asked with the word of truth imagined begat this to be fathered he fathered us before the foundation of the world with the word of truth now just as sure is in this modern day make him take a DNA sample and they can identify people who you are related to I know of a brother that was given up for adoption when he was quite and through all the years and and another brother in the church and encouraged him and the two of them went together and did one of those DNA things and both of them had have been adopted and the brother was shocked to find that he had a lot of relatives in a city not far from them and so it was there that he he realized now how it all tied together parts of the pieces of the puzzle that he never dreamed he has a grandmother still living he has aunts and uncles he has all kinds of relatives still living and by God's grace they have been very open and receptive you know and when his grandmother met him for the first time she said a statement on the order of something about this party is for my grandson I never knew I had and so you recognized that my brother's sister so if God begat us with a word of truth then what is our DNA truth our DNA cannot be false it cannot be a deception it can't be a lie if we were begat with truth hallelujah thank you Lord I love that because what we are my brother and sister is then the very truth which is God passed down in the DNA or bloodline and therefore every seed must bring forth of its own kind and if the seed that begat you and I was truth and that means we will bring forth truth Oh hallelujah I love that it's a lovely thing you realize that it's not here whether we're worried about Satan going to deceive us or some man come into our midst into the church that would come and deceive us my brother and sister the very DNA that is in us is the DNA of truth so what will come forth of us now we'll touch on this in just a minute but it was well look I'll get ahead of myself I can't help it here remember what brother Branham talked about that citrus and neighbors there with that brother and he grafted in all these different kinds of citrus and brother branham ask you he says now when that comes forth it will bring forth but I believe it was a lemon tree all this and brother Brown says now okay when when this comes and brings a new crop it'll be what that was he said no everything that was in grafted in oh I hope you get this everything that was in grafted in will bring forth of the fruit of what it was now when you look at that you realize that you have a lemon tree and you graft a grapefruit into it some kind of citrus into it and it's going to bring forth of its kind my brother and sister that part that was grafted in cannot bring forth anything else but what its DNA is are you with me amen so look at this of his own will begat he with us word of truth that we should be a kind of firstfruits of his creatures Oh to be a first fruit you've got to be of the original amen so it's there he says wherefore my beloved brethren let every man be swift to hear slow to speak slow to wrath for the wrath of man worketh not the righteousness of God wherefore lay apart all filthiness and superfluity of naughtiness and receive with meekness in other words don't be haughty about what God has done for you receive with meekness the engrafted word which is able to save your souls so what was in grafted into you and I my brother and sister what was placed I mean into you begat into you and I let me get my thoughts straight as we are grafted in if Christ is truth and were grafted into him what will we bring forth truth we cannot bring forth the Carnales of Laodicea we can't bring any deceivableness or superfluity my brother's sister we have to bring forth truth this is what sets the difference of the bride from being a Christian in name only as it to being the real Christian is because she was begat in truth and she's grafted into truth and the only thing she can bring forth then will be truth amen that's why she will not put up with a hybrid religion she will not be put up with the Word of God being twisted and turned because she knows the very very very SAP as it were typing it back to the tree that flows through the original is now flowing through them because the DNA of truth is in the original and the DNA of truth is in them that they will bring forth as it says here in the scripture the firstfruits in other words it won't be my brother and sister some haughty high-minded I'll just bite those words off amen you see I want to focus for a second right in the last portion of that it says will receive that means something's coming to us with meekness the engrafted word oh my brother and sister you look at that it's just so beautiful he says here in verse 22 but be doers of the word not hearers only I believe right here in this scripture verse 22 is the greatest deception my brother and sister that is facing many people will look out here and you know what I have justify my studies and and looking my brother and sister the people that want to buy these these guys jet airplanes so they can fly around on a 40 million dollar plane these people that want to build the Taj Mahal of a church and they give all their money to do that they're really not looking for the engrafted word they're looking for someone they can identify with and so it is back to the carnal side looking to man living under that you know to have the sticker on your car I support such and such ministries or I associate they're telling the world this is my identity that's why mother's sister put this out his opinion if you don't agree with me please listen off fuss about it but that's why I'm not real big my brother and sister I don't need to have a tie tack or collar tack I don't need a bumper sticker what I need is an identity in Jesus Christ and my life is the evidence of my identity it's not what's stuck on my car or on the front window of my house or or whatever else it is the identity of the life amen so now you look at this my brother and sister it says right here Oh hallelujah but be doers of the word so it's giving us a commandment that there's an action that we must take and if we are a doer of the word amen well hallelujah not just to here gonna be a lot of here's my brother and sister there are a lot of years there's a lot of people who will tell you I've listened to every sermon brother Branham preached X amount of times that's good but what my question for you will be what are you doing with it amen we can hear it and hear it and hear it you know I always thought this was funny you go to a doctor and he tells you you know what your cholesterol is too high you're a little bit overweight what you need to do is go on a diet and change this and change that and for your health and then the doctor grunts and groans as he heaves his overweight body out of the chair that he was sitting in while he talks to you my brother and sister let's not just be hearers of the word but let us be doers hallelujah I always found it humorous in many years ago I visited a doctor and he walked into the room and started his little you know interview of me about my health issue and he smelled like cigarettes and finally he gets to this spot and he says do you smoke and I said no sir never have never will and he says well he said let me tell you and he lowered his voice as though there was somebody listening it's a filthy habit and I thought wow here you are telling me that this is a filthy habit but it's obviously a habit you have listen to yourself Oh Lord you know sometimes Saints we actually preach the best sermons we'll ever hear we preach to ourselves amen sometimes when we say you know I shouldn't be doing this we ought to stop and say Amen yeah God will deal with us so we're not going to just be hearers we're going to be doers because you see verse 22 says that when we are be doers of the word and not hearers only deceiving your own selves to only hear the word my brother and sister we can be so concerned about who's going to come in and preach a version of the message to us that we're is we're just guns I to hear it but yet my brother's sister the word clearly shows us that if we hear the word and we don't do it we are not getting deceived by this man or this man we are deceiving ourselves now as a believer my brother and sister the prophet of God taught us that we should take everything back to the Word of God to check it against the word so someone come and preaches something maybe you haven't heard it that way or they have a claim of a great revelation and the Prophet showed us you take it back to the word you check it against the word and if it doesn't pass a word test and then you don't receive it you don't act upon that my brother and sister but what I would propose to each and every one of you it is not just us taking what someone else says or does back to the word to be able to judge them but are we willing tonight to take ourself back to the word and judge our life because if we are willing to change ourself back to the word and say Lord how does my life stand up against the Word of God and if we are here and a doer we will see in the word where we stand and then that will bring us as the prophet of God said we're backslide many times a day that's good but are we repenting many times a day there's the key we need to repent many times a day not just acknowledge what I did wasn't right anyone can say yep I shouldn't have yelled I shouldn't have caused confusion in the church I shouldn't have troubled the waters I shouldn't have done all this stuff but are they willing to repent from that there is the action to hearing amen but you see if we're not willing to take ourself back to the word to judge ourselves then we don't have to worry about brother so-and-so from India we don't have to worry about this person over here we don't have to worry about this person across the country there because we're deceiving ourself whoa talk about something that would be troubling imagine you get there on that day and it looks kind of troubling for you and you're thinking well it was this preacher it was that preacher it was my pastor wouldn't it be shocking to find out that the very deception that would keep you out of the rapture would have been yourself oh my my oh my for if any be a hearer of the word and not a doer he is like unto a man beholding his natural face in a glass for he beholdeth himself in other words he has an image to uphold - or look - and goeth his way and straightway forgetteth what manner of man he was you know you can type verse 24 or at least this is a way I understand it Lord correct me if I'm wrong but my brother and sister we can sit right here in church and we can say this is who I am this is an identity that I recognize or hold to but if we go out and we are out here in the world and we can't remember who we were in the mirror of God's Word we're deceiving ourselves we're in trouble hallelujah amen so but whoso looketh see this is something I just love here whoso looketh into the perfect law of Liberty and continueth therein oh my just staying under that perfect law of Liberty he bring he being not a forgetful hearer but a doer of the work this man shall be blessed in his deed oh thing about what God's doing how we see that there are families there are men women brothers sisters we see them being blessed in their work and what they're doing in their life and people say well they're really forcing us but you look my brother and sister and they are not just hearing but they are doing the Word of God and God says right here in verse 25 he'll bless them oh my I want to be that man amen now this verse 26 I find it interesting when you have people that are argumented and you have people that want to fight with you over what the message would mean it says right here if any man among you seemed to be religious and Bridal if not his tongue but deceiveth his own heart this man's religion is vain pure religion and undefiled before God and the father is this to visit the fatherless and widows in their affliction and to keep himself unspotted from the world oh my brother and sister we can stand on the corners that was the that was the realm that was the Avenue that was the the anointing that the Sadducees and Pharisees and the Herodians and all of them had was to sit around and argue what what the what the scriptures of their day you know as they was looking to argue what it meant and the importance of it but we're not to do that were to let the life of Christ be manifested out of our own life amen now I'd like to go into the message the thirst some of these quotes are tad bit longer so bear with me he says now you cannot pull sin through the pages of this Bible Wow so you know if we actually put this first reminds me years ago I was sharing some things with a brother and I'd said brother you know it was really sad I was here at this home and and this is this and this and this is what I saw and he said oh brother Paul I'm not trying to one-up you but he said let me share something I encountered something I experienced and and this brothers quite well known around the message he said I I was there and this this man and this brother invited him to his house and and he went and when he walked in the house he was kind of amazed here was like the biggest flat-screen or whatever TV that you could get at the time and he said what would you think would be right on top of that television I was like well I don't know he said there was the biggest picture of brother Branham sitting on top of that television and he said it really bothered me he says because here the prophet of God blasted the television and the man has brother roms pitcher on top of the television now he said that wasn't the whole thing the man wanted to talk a little business with him and he says brother he said when brother Branham comes back he said I have a bank account of money that I want to give to the Prophet to help him with his ministry when he comes back and the man shared what the total was and the total was very outstanding it was quite an astounding amount of money that the man had been saving the man had had a good business and made a good living through the years and he'd put all of this into this investment account and it was a staggering sum of money and the man wanted this brother to help him coordinate funneling this money to brother Branham when he came back and this brothers quite outspoken and he told him he said I can't help you and he said well you don't believe you could make the connections the brother looked at him said I don't plan on being here now my brother and sister you say well that's kind of rude that's kind of rough but you see it's what preparation is being made some are being prepared to come to a time to do certain things but the message of the hour I believe it undiluted undefiled unleavened is producing a people that are not looking for something as it were to come back but they're looking for a calling away they're looking to to leave this earth not deal with the circumstances of the future in other words we don't need to build a bomb shelter my brother and sister because the prophet of God said he saw America a great smoldering ruins and you know we're not looking to build a bomb shelter we're looking to be out of here when judgment strikes this earth hey men so you cannot pull sin through the pages of the Bible so in other words my brother and sister I'm just going to speak real direct to us tonight in other words when we see sin in the church unhindered somebody is not filtering amen they're not filtering because you see you can't pull sin through the pages of this Bible no it stops it it filters it out now you can go to church and just take anything but you can't come through this Bible and have sin I think that's pretty straight is it not amen it will not do it it filters out all sin it gives a holy man's taste because if the man is thinking that he wants to be holy hmm look at the position here because if the man is thinking that he wants to be holy and be like God and be a son or a daughter of God then he wants the right kind of filter he stops all sin on this side of the Bible and he can only bring the Holy Spirit through the Bible that wrote in the Bible it's a holy man's taste to have this thinking man's filter now we find how deceiving it is today Matthew 24:24 Jesus said in the last days that the two spirits would be so close alike that until it would deceive the very elect if it was possible how close how what a deception of right and wrong we have today even in in our government our politics we haven't even got a man that could put up as a politician that will absolutely stand up for what he thinks is right now look at what we got for politicians here my goodness brother and sister we have seen the greatest debacle in the last decade of politicians in our nation they can't even stand up for anything that's right they are worried about being read elected they're worried about their retirement they're worried about everything but this nation now when you look at that as a prophet of God is speaking this my brother and sister when you think about the fact he's speaking this in 1965 he is describing perfectly the politician of our day amen say one thing do what's convenient amen where is our Patrick Henry's and George Washington's and Abraham Lincoln's of today just as our president said they're the way if they want communism they can have it whatever the people wants if that ain't a man that won't speak his conviction I believe it was Lyndon Johnson that was a president at this time if Eddie just a man that won't speak his conviction a man will stand on principle that will stand on what's what's what a principle just want to go the way of least resistance and that's the way what the people's has got in the church mine is Grace a church of least resistance Saints where we rally together and push for what is right or what is the least resistant I say God give us courage for what is right amen and that's the way that the people has got in the church they want to come join church and say oh well that that's it I've joined Church now you're trying to satisfy that great holy thirst that God put in you that control tower trying to turn you to the right thing and you're trying to satisfy with joining a church quoting a Creed or something like that now look as we was talking earlier my brother and sister about the carcass you see this word this carcass is so beautiful so delicious as you would say that to the bride of Jesus Christ to the eagle that she is so attracted to this carcass that met nothing's going to stop her and it's not about the church it's not about the group it's not about the religious or social structure it's about the war it's about that carcass is what is attracting her am i happy to go to church with you yes I'm happy to go to church with the saints of grace but my brother and sister it's the word that brings us together not personalities not convenience but the word amen you try to satisfy that great holy thirst that God put in you that control tower trying to turn you to the right thing oh my and you try to satisfy it with joining a church quoting a Creed or something like that why it's nothing but the very presence and the filling of God Himself in your life that will satisfy it there's the beauty of this carcass is God's laid it in front of us and here it is we have access to it but it isn't even us because it's him drawing us it's the carcass drawing you and I because the carcass and the carcass alone will satisfy no amount we have a wonderful musicians we have a wonderful song leader we have these things but we can't come here and just sing song after song after song and go home and say we're satisfied we've got to have some word to feed on we've got to have something that will come and satisfy that holy thirst that is in us amen and this is what God's doing because in the preparation of you and I the preparation of this inner man were coming to the place where once discharged as a function as an activity as a group was enough but now we've been drawn into a deeper relationship that we must have something solid to feed upon and I say thank you for that Lord hallelujah now it's nothing but the very presence and filling of God himself in your life that will satisfy that he won't be satisfied with a Creed my eye sometimes you know they talk about social experiments my brothers sisters sometimes I thought before I'd list like - I just like to do a social experiment in church and and just you know take the preaching for maybe a month or something and preach fundamentally truth but just kind of water it down hey we're all going to heaven we're all gonna do it God loves us and just see what the church what would the church's reaction would somebody be saying what's going on brother Paul you've kind of watered this message down made it like everybody's going to make a rapture what's going on people just sit back and say yep yep yep yep yep well I'm not brave enough to take a social experiment like that I took one a few years ago when I preached about how I was quitting the message and you know and a few started looks in the church and then I just remember brother Bob he looked up from about the third or fourth row in the old church he looked up at me nodded his head and just grinned III didn't fool him for a moment but my point was when I preached that sermon about while I left the message my brother and sister I was driving home the point of what we believe is this Bible we don't have to identify it I believe a message I believe a message this is what we believe this is our foundation this is our fundamental and this is adequate to prepare the inner man for a rapture you know prepare the inner man to live in the presence of Almighty God for eternity it is sufficient hallelujah God sent a prophet he come and he brought clarity to the Word of God and it's there that we find the life without the confusion without all the misunderstandings and it's there and everything we need has been given to us hallelujah hallelujah he says you know you'll never pull a Creed through through that Bible no there's not even the Apostles Creed so-called will never come through there show me in the Bible where the pro so Creed says I believe in the Holy Roman Catholic Church I believe in the communion of saints when the Bible said there's only one mediator between God and man and that's the man Christ Jesus you'll never pull that through the Bible speaking of the Apostles Creed and stuff you'll never pull all these dances and shorts and things people are doing today twists and wah to cease and all these things through God's Word you'll never pull this modern trend of civilization through that Bible it's against it see and you try to satisfy that thirst but you see you know the Bible will only satisfy a righteous man or woman's taste so while the Bible is the largest greatest read book on it will only satisfy a righteous man or woman's taste this holy spirit that they would laugh at and said you've gone out of your mind but that satisfies that longing that's something that the world knows nothing about and I can say amen to that I've been down that road I've been in that position where you look and you look and you look for something to satisfy I thought as a young man that by doing risky things you know and and just living as a adrenaline junkie that that somehow would satisfy but it didn't because the very next time you had to go out and try to find something that exceeded the last experience but when we have a true experience in Jesus Christ the inner man becoming satisfied not not to become lackadaisical or lazy but just satisfy brings a peace and it brings a in our life where we can sit down and say though all hail assail me I shall not be moved hallelujah thank you lord amen but that satisfies that longing that's something that the world knows nothing about they have perverted themselves from to baptism of the Holy Spirit in the word of God unto what unto the cesspool success pools of the Church of dogma Creed denominational differences and so forth oh my prophet doesn't mince any words does he boy I tell you what now I want to just close this out here tonight as I said earlier many people would use the term I grew up with LDS or Mormon influence in our families some Catholic influence in our families and you know I've been around a lot of different religions but those two both I just would bring a clarity both of those religions you will hear people say well I'm a Catholic I'm just not practicing now when you think about that my brother and sister they're giving our identity to something but they're saying I don't believe it enough to do it not practicing in the Mormon background very much the same I remember growing up families kids I went to school with with friends with families that I know and they would tell you we're Mormon but but we're not practicing we're Jack Mormons well you know what brother and sister you are what you identify with and you know I'm this is gonna be a little harsh and probably I shouldn't say it but I feel - I'm rather and sister around the message you don't see people saying you know I'm I believe the message but I'm not practicing it what you see is people that say I believe the message and they live any way they please see there's not even an identity that I know this is truth so you see when the Catholic says I'm a Catholic but I'm not practicing it they're acknowledging they believe the Catholic Church correct when you have a Mormon who says I'm Mormon but I'm a Jack Mormon I'm just not doing it but they're acknowledging there's a connection but I find this common trend you don't find people in the message saying I'm a jack message or I'm a non-practicing message believer my brother and sister what we have is one of the greatest fundamental deficiencies that is coming upon the earth today in the realm of the message and people say I believe the message and they live any way they please but yet they will project that they are a believer because they are hearing the word or have heard the word but they are not acting on it this scripture clearly says they're deceiving themselves this sounds judgmental but my brother's sister I'm not judging them I'm just bringing you the word that unction should come upon us that when we hear the word hey look I give you this route you hear the word don't take my word for it take it back to your Bible take it back as a cross-section of reference in the message because the prophet of God talked about the sights on the gun barrel take it back line it all up and if it is the truth well if it's not the truth you need to get rid of me but if it's the truth don't just hear it act on it do something with it it change your life even if it is just one little thing that it changes let it change it all my practicing the definition in short the abbreviated is an actual application as opposed to theory let's not let the message be theory to us let's be practicing believers amen Oh hallelujah we're either a Christian or were not amen we're either a believer or we're not oh my I got it one another just slightly longer quote here but we'll we'll go ahead and go into it real quick in faith in action what good does it do to paint fire to a freezing man show him a picture of a nice big warm fire and man's are freezing that's something that was that's what people are trying to keep you alive by today no wonder we got failure in America of religion no wonder the magazine says the spiritual Longo is a burst is because they failed to represent the right thing to them they're trying to teach them of a historical God now my brother and sister if we're not careful will preach or teach to our church a historical message we got a message that's living today Jesus Christ alive today there is people who can receive and will receive the Holy Ghost today there's people that will be healed today there will be people that will be delivered today we don't have to look in the past we don't have to go back and find a reference point in years or whatever gone by but we can find that right today what we need today is a God resurrected from the dead and on right hand now to do whatever he promised he would do to confirm his word and we need this I love this portion right here and we need delegates out there in the audience who's willing to rest their soul on any word that God said and put it to action amen oh can we say amen to that tonight we need delegates who would be a delegate tonight maybe you could lift your hand let the Lord know Lord I'd be a delegate Amen that would be willing to rest my soul on any word Lord that you said and to put it to action amen going back a little reference to what we preached in Phoenix my brother and sister if there is an action there has to be a reaction and the prophet of God talking there as they held a prayer line early on and people stepped out to receive their healing the prophet of God says because you took that action there will be a reaction to your action oh my brother and sister you don't have to be a great man you don't have to do that all you've got to do is step out and receive what God's got for you and there will be an action in reaction amen Oh hallelujah that's what we need today sister Emmy would you come that's what we need today that's what we need is men and women who stand up to the forefront there and call the devil a liar I like this quote amen that's what we need is men and women who stand up to the forefront there and call the devil a liar and say Jesus Christ stripped you and robbed you of every right you had and I'm in Christ Jesus and the world belongs to me amen right hallelujah oh that's a position my brother and sister let's take this Word of God is giving preparation to the inner man we can stand every test every struggle every battle and come out victorious because we can take these words right here and call the devil a liar hallelujah Satan you're simply a liar you've already been stripped and you've been robbed of every right you have you have nothing over on us because the word has prepared us to take our reward which is a rapture and life in the presence of Almighty God amen it's good to be here tonight Saints I trust maybe God just stir your heart just a little bit amen brother Jason if you could just come and maybe sing a song or two for us Saints as your each one in your homes we just ask that the Lord would just speak to you amen as we hear the word let's be a doer of that word take that word put it to action and watch as you put an action forward to come closer to the Lord just the promise of the word says that God will bring that reaction which will change your life and we want to as a church be changed we don't want to just go day by day just doing the same thing over and over again but we want the presence of Almighty God to come down in our midst amen hallelujah but this turn this over for a song or two with our brother Jay god bless you Saints we love you in the Lord look forward to Sunday amen amen trust you've enjoyed that let's sing give me that old-time religion 475 give me that old-time religion give me that old-time religion give me that old-time religion and it's good enough for me it's that all-time holy spirit and the devil
