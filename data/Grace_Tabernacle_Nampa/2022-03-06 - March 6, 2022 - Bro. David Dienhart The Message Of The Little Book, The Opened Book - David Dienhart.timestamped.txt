[28:47] amen and those that have
[28:50] well we all have it's not just those
[28:51] that have we all have brothers and
[28:53] sisters in christ all over the world
[28:56] in ukraine and we're especially holding
[28:59] them up in prayer not only ukraine
[29:01] russia
[29:02] poland
[29:03] latvia lithuania
[29:05] belarus whatever it is it's just
[29:07] they're brothers and sisters and i know
[29:09] there's bride in every one of those
[29:10] countries
[29:12] but you know what let me just encourage
[29:14] those and i know sister yulia you have a
[29:16] cousin family i know vasili ivan
[29:21] the super family have family here in in
[29:24] ukraine but brother branham said let me
[29:27] remind you of this
[29:30] brother brown said nothing can happen by
[29:33] chance
[29:34] to a christian
[29:37] nothing
[29:38] he said because all things work together
[29:41] for good
[29:43] to them that love god
[29:45] that are called that are the call you
[29:47] notice he didn't say a call thee called
[29:50] according to his
[29:52] his calling his purpose exactly right
[29:55] and you know every member of that bride
[29:57] and i believe that's the calling that's
[29:59] the called every member of that bride is
[30:01] under an eternal purpose
[30:03] amen so we have nothing to fear not one
[30:06] thing to fear not one thing to be
[30:08] anxiety over and i know sister toma
[30:11] her mother and i don't know if she's
[30:13] still out of the nest can't get into the
[30:15] nest because i know they have a barrier
[30:17] there now and
[30:19] but here again
[30:21] every believer
[30:22] every one of them
[30:24] nothing happens by chance
[30:27] you know in our human mind that's where
[30:28] we have to lay down our human mind which
[30:30] is easier to take the reasoning of the
[30:32] devil
[30:33] science and education
[30:38] amen or
[30:40] simply take him at his word
[30:43] which is easier
[30:45] god made it simple didn't he he didn't
[30:47] have to figure anything out just take me
[30:48] at my word believe what i said it's got
[30:51] a mad come to manifestation why because
[30:53] it's eternal
[30:54] amen so god bless you nice to be in the
[30:57] house of the lord
[30:58] i'd like you to stand with me and we'll
[31:00] have a word of prayer and we'll go to
[31:01] the word of revelation
[31:03] the revelation of jesus christ
[31:07] i'm referring to it that way because
[31:09] that's what this book of revelation is
[31:12] is the revelation it's the complete
[31:14] revelation
[31:16] amen there's two books that satan hates
[31:18] genesis and revelation
[31:20] because the revelation
[31:22] the genesis exposes him and revelations
[31:25] the alpha and omega it's the same person
[31:28] he showed forth in genesis what he would
[31:30] do in revelation amen
[31:33] and so we are
[31:35] just happy in this hour to be walking in
[31:37] such a light
[31:39] isaiah 60 says thy light has come
[31:42] and such a light that we can walk in you
[31:46] know those that are those that we walk
[31:48] in the light the bible says we're
[31:50] walking in the light
[31:52] and in him is no darkness at all
[31:55] amen so we aren't in darkness
[31:57] we're in the light we're in him this is
[32:00] the message that's his message god is
[32:02] light
[32:03] and in him
[32:05] and if you're in him praise be to god
[32:08] what's there to fear he is my light and
[32:10] my salvation psalm 27 1
[32:13] he is my light and my salvation whom
[32:15] shall i fear
[32:18] the bible said goes on to say and i
[32:20] think in that same scripture he said i
[32:22] said if the war rise against me
[32:26] and this will i be confident
[32:28] that i'm seated in heavenly places in
[32:31] christ jesus
[32:33] seated hidden in the secret of himself
[32:36] who can touch you
[32:38] when you're in him
[32:40] who can touch you what plague can come
[32:42] nigh your dwelling
[32:45] your dwelling is christ his dwelling is
[32:48] you
[32:49] but your dwelling is inside of him
[32:52] amen so you're protected that's to the
[32:55] born again that's to those seed that
[32:57] have been quickened
[32:58] amen and become the holy spirit in you
[33:01] you are the holy spirit in you
[33:03] and so
[33:04] and that's the word i thought sounds
[33:06] strange but
[33:08] that's the truth
[33:09] that couldn't be opened to us until this
[33:12] hour
[33:14] amen
[33:15] amen so we have the light and so the
[33:17] bible said and i think it's psalm 91
[33:21] he said
[33:22] though a thousand he said the thousands
[33:23] shall fall by my i think my left side
[33:25] and there are ten thousand on my right
[33:27] or vice versa i can't remember
[33:29] but it shall not come not you right
[33:33] amen
[33:34] you'll see them fall on this side and
[33:36] fall on that side exactly what's
[33:37] happening
[33:38] exactly what's happening the word of
[33:40] god's got to be fulfilled that's what
[33:42] it's all about in ukraine
[33:44] amen the word of god is being fulfilled
[33:48] but the bride of jesus christ is the
[33:50] word promise for this hour made manifest
[33:54] the word of promise which is god himself
[33:56] in himself the bride
[33:58] amen
[34:00] heavenly father
[34:01] as we bow our heads in your presence
[34:03] this morning we are not here by chance
[34:06] we have not been seated here by chance
[34:08] where these people are seated right now
[34:10] is not by chance
[34:11] there's not one thing by chance lord
[34:13] that we've come here now and i pray that
[34:15] every heart has come open to receive the
[34:17] word
[34:19] not them not a word of david not the
[34:22] word of a man but they've come here it's
[34:24] not a man among us no flesh shall glory
[34:26] in your presence
[34:28] we have come here to receive the truth
[34:30] we have come here lord because we're
[34:32] hungry we have come here needing more of
[34:34] you because we have a goal
[34:37] and that's the change of our body
[34:40] and you step forth in this hour to
[34:42] receive a son to yourself that where you
[34:44] are we may be also you had to take the
[34:47] book
[34:48] and you had to claim your possession
[34:50] that you have already redeemed
[34:53] but you come forth to claim it
[34:55] now father we don't know when that last
[34:57] one comes in
[34:58] we don't know that but lord the door
[35:00] will be shut
[35:01] and we trust it isn't shut yet
[35:04] that there's still lord and i know the
[35:06] bride has a hungry heart and i know the
[35:08] bride will be willing and is laying in
[35:10] the presence of the son eating the
[35:12] opened word
[35:14] bless your word this morning now i pray
[35:17] as we give you all the time you need
[35:20] we're not going to put you in a box this
[35:22] morning

[35:31] individual may you so captivate the
[35:33] individuals this morning to your word
[35:36] as we ask this now in thy name the lord
[35:39] jesus christ our redeemer our lord our
[35:42] refuge our revelation
[35:45] we pray amen
[35:48] amen
[35:50] amen turn me to the book
[35:53] the revelation of jesus christ
[35:56] chapter 10.
[35:58] several scriptures here we just want to
[36:00] follow as the lord leads us here this
[36:02] morning
[36:03] revelations 10 1
[36:05] starting with verse 1 and i saw another
[36:09] mighty angel come down from heaven i
[36:11] wonder if we've seen him
[36:14] clothed with the cloud
[36:16] just like he went away he comes again
[36:19] and i in a rainbow was upon his head and
[36:22] his face as it were the sun
[36:25] i wonder if that could also mean s-o-n
[36:28] they took a picture of it you know
[36:31] as it were the sun and his feet as
[36:33] pillars of fire
[36:36] and he had
[36:37] i want you to notice who had it in his
[36:40] hand
[36:42] and how does god work
[36:44] how does god reveal his word i will do
[36:47] nothing but i reveal my secrets to my
[36:49] servants the prophets
[36:51] so who did we see manifested through
[36:53] that prophet in this hour who was
[36:55] identified the son of man
[36:59] through a son of man
[37:01] amen then he had in his hand
[37:04] remember brother branham said i was
[37:05] caught up in the consolation and i had
[37:07] to get the revelation of that seal
[37:09] seventh seal and he said i had to come
[37:11] back with that revelation
[37:14] and he had in his hand a little book
[37:18] open
[37:20] notice a little book open
[37:26] and he set his right foot upon the sea
[37:28] and his left foot upon the earth
[37:30] and cried with a loud voice i wonder if
[37:33] it could be the same voice as the
[37:35] resurrection
[37:38] and he cried with a loud voice as when
[37:40] the a lion
[37:42] roareth
[37:45] remember the lion who is manifested as
[37:47] the lamb couldn't be made known until
[37:49] the end it was the end time the lion
[37:52] was revealed
[37:56] cried with a loud voice is when a lion
[37:58] roareth and when he had cried seven
[38:00] thunders uttered their voices
[38:04] and when the seven thunders had uttered
[38:06] their voices i was about to write john
[38:08] speaking and i heard a voice from heaven
[38:11] saying unto me from heaven seal up those
[38:14] things
[38:15] which the seven thunders uttered and
[38:17] write them not brother branham said he
[38:19] couldn't write it he knew what it said
[38:22] but he couldn't write what it said
[38:24] and he said because this is also sealed
[38:26] in heaven
[38:29] remember revelations 8 1
[38:32] said there was a there was when he had
[38:34] re when he had opened the seventh seal
[38:37] there was silence where
[38:40] in noting this is the mystery now opened
[38:43] what john couldn't write
[38:45] amen all right then i want to jump down
[38:48] here
[38:49] to seven
[38:50] and notice this comes at the time when
[38:52] there's time no longer that's verse six
[38:57] long longer time is no longer delayed
[38:59] remember the seventh seal is the end of
[39:01] time of all things
[39:05] that's why we see things happening the
[39:07] way they are at the end of time
[39:09] it's the end of time of all things
[39:13] amen comes to a close finishes verse 7.
[39:17] here's a mystery
[39:19] couldn't write but
[39:22] but
[39:22] in the days
[39:25] of the voice
[39:27] of the seventh angel
[39:30] when he shall begin to sound
[39:33] watch this
[39:34] the mystery of god
[39:37] i wonder who reveals the mystery of god
[39:40] christ
[39:42] christ is the mystery of god
[39:45] revealed
[39:46] all right
[39:47] all right he says the mystery of god
[39:51] should be
[39:53] finished
[39:54] other words completed
[39:58] as he hath declared to his servants the
[40:02] prophets
[40:08] and when he and and the voice which i
[40:11] heard from heaven spake unto me again
[40:14] and said go and take the little book
[40:18] which is open in the hand now who's he
[40:20] speaking to john being a type of the
[40:22] bride said go take the little book
[40:24] which is open in the hand of the angel
[40:27] that switched standeth upon the sea and
[40:29] upon the earth and i went unto the angel
[40:32] messenger and the angel christ brother
[40:34] brahm said that's christ in revelations
[40:36] 10
[40:38] i went unto the angel and said unto him
[40:40] give me
[40:42] give me i wonder how many have said give
[40:44] me lord
[40:45] give me the revelation that book
[40:49] give me
[40:50] the little book and he said unto me take
[40:53] it
[40:54] now notice it's been opened by this the
[40:56] messenger of the
[40:58] of the of the under the seventh angel's
[41:00] message his message was to open this
[41:03] little book
[41:04] to reveal the mystery in that book
[41:06] brother branham said his message of
[41:08] revelations 10 was the seventh seal
[41:13] okay
[41:14] okay are we all with all of you all
[41:15] together
[41:16] those seven seals had to be open there
[41:18] were seven thunders but brother graham
[41:20] said one thunder seven messages
[41:24] all right we know a thunder denotes the
[41:25] voice of god it's spake
[41:28] there's a blast of thunder amen
[41:32] and their seven angels appeared
[41:36] that's right
[41:37] is that right
[41:39] all right
[41:40] all right now he says now it's been
[41:42] opened now he's tall asked john he's
[41:44] told the bride you go and take the book
[41:46] you go take the book and you eat it up
[41:48] and it shall make thy belly bitter
[41:50] everybody's going to be against you is
[41:51] going to have a hard time is going to
[41:53] call you fanatics they're going to call
[41:54] you this they're going to call you that
[41:56] they think this about that about it it's
[41:58] a hardship
[42:02] a struggle
[42:04] amen in the flesh
[42:07] you're in a battle
[42:10] amen but the battle is not between you
[42:12] and satan it's between god and satan
[42:14] that god in you that revealed word in
[42:16] you the who you are that battles between
[42:18] the word and satan
[42:20] it's not between you the flesh man and
[42:21] satan
[42:23] your enemy is standing right there
[42:26] covering you
[42:28] your greatest enemy you've got the
[42:30] greatest enemy i've got's david dean
[42:31] hart
[42:33] but that enemy is dead
[42:36] that enemy you say well you're pretty
[42:37] much alive to me but that nature is gone
[42:41] that tried to rule over me because i'm a
[42:43] new creation in my soul
[42:46] amen amen so the battle is between what
[42:49] he thinks and what the word thinks
[42:52] but it's not be so that it's between the
[42:54] enemy and god
[42:57] hallelujah
[42:59] he told us what your greatest enemy was
[43:01] and he'll try to speak to you every day
[43:03] in fact he's probably already tried this
[43:04] morning
[43:08] amen
[43:09] he'll try to use the channel of your
[43:10] spirit well god wants to use the channel
[43:12] of your spirit so you have to keep your
[43:14] thoughts under obedience to christ
[43:16] you have to keep your spirit realm your
[43:18] little human spirit realm under
[43:20] obedience to christ
[43:25] so he's at told john you go take it it's
[43:27] going to make your belly bitter but when
[43:28] it comes in your mouth it is sweet as
[43:31] honey
[43:32] how many has experienced that
[43:34] absolutely
[43:36] all right
[43:38] and i took the little book out of the
[43:39] angel's hand and ate it up and it was in
[43:41] my mouth sweet as honey as soon as eaten
[43:43] my belly was bitter and he said unto me
[43:46] thou must prophesy
[43:49] final voice
[43:51] thou must prophesy again before many
[43:54] peoples and nations and tongues and
[43:56] kings because you've got a message
[43:59] you've got an opened book
[44:02] you know the message you are the message
[44:06] i'll just say that i'm going to preach
[44:08] it this morning my title
[44:10] i don't know if they wrote that down on
[44:11] there but my title is this the message
[44:13] of the little book
[44:16] the opened book
[44:18] or the words the opened record
[44:20] you may be seated
[44:23] the message of the little book
[44:27] amen
[44:28] that message in itself
[44:30] will rapture a bride out of here
[44:33] [Music]
[44:34] amen that message in itself was sent
[44:38] for the going home of the bride it's the
[44:40] seventh angel's message so i'm speaking
[44:43] of the message of the little book and we
[44:46] think it's so deep and so hard
[44:48] it's simply so simple you can't in your
[44:51] human knowledge figure it out
[44:53] that's just exactly what it is
[44:55] it takes the revelation of god to to
[44:58] catch this it doesn't take your
[45:00] intellects
[45:01] you try to figure it out i'll just tell
[45:03] you right now quit doing it
[45:05] because you can't
[45:06] and you're going to get frustrated and
[45:08] upset and you're going to get weird
[45:10] because you can't figure it out
[45:13] it's not your working it's the working
[45:15] of god
[45:17] in you
[45:19] all right
[45:20] i'd like you to turn with me to genesis
[45:22] or our first john i'm sorry go to first
[45:24] john
[45:26] i'm going to go through this as quick as
[45:27] i can
[45:28] and i want to stay focused this morning
[45:31] there's lots of things we could say
[45:32] about these things and i just believe
[45:35] that it's been put down here this has
[45:37] been given here and i i want to bring
[45:39] this
[45:41] in first john 5
[45:43] and i'll just we could start there at
[45:45] verse 9
[45:47] or verse 6 actually showing the birth
[45:49] showing the witness of the holy spirit
[45:51] which is the token
[45:53] but it comes to verse
[45:54] 11.
[45:56] or just take verse 10 and he that
[45:58] believeth on the son of god hath the
[46:00] witness the witness is the token the
[46:02] witness is the person of the holy spirit
[46:04] in you christ
[46:05] he that believeth on the son of god hath
[46:09] the witness in himself
[46:11] he that believeth not god hath made him
[46:13] a liar because he believeth not the
[46:15] record i want you to notice this he
[46:17] believeth not the record
[46:19] that god gave of his son
[46:23] and this is the record
[46:25] that god hath given to us i want you to
[46:27] notice this this is the record
[46:31] we're talking about a little book
[46:34] that was sealed up
[46:38] and when he had cried when he had voiced
[46:40] the revelation of that book
[46:43] seven thunders under their voices
[46:45] there's something that was said
[46:48] but it was sealed up and could not be
[46:50] made known until this day
[46:53] and the reason it was hid because it was
[46:55] kept from the devil so he couldn't get
[46:57] it
[46:58] but now it can be opened up in the time
[47:00] it was called to be opened up and meant
[47:02] to be opened up and here it is being
[47:04] opened
[47:06] in our day
[47:07] and it's only
[47:09] for the bride
[47:10] brother brahm said the seventh seal the
[47:12] revelation of these seven seals is only
[47:15] for the bride
[47:17] this little book only can contain names
[47:20] and i'm going to say right now because i
[47:22] want to bring it into what the church
[47:23] age here quickly
[47:25] that the though that book contained
[47:27] names
[47:29] and that book was the names of only his
[47:32] bride
[47:33] and it's a part of
[47:35] the lamb's book of life or the book of
[47:38] life brother brahm said there's no
[47:40] difference i can tell you right where he
[47:41] said some think there's a difference
[47:43] between the book of life and the lamb
[47:44] book of life he said it's the same book
[47:49] amen he said there's no difference it's
[47:51] the same book
[47:53] it could be called the book of life the
[47:54] book of christ
[47:56] it's it's several names and the bible
[47:58] refer to that
[48:00] but brother brahm said there's no
[48:01] difference
[48:03] amen
[48:04] because because he said and i'll refer
[48:06] to this in just a moment where that is
[48:09] but he said remember he used the wheat
[48:11] plant as the as one seed going in
[48:14] one seed falling in the ground to bring
[48:16] a multiple of seeds at the end
[48:19] and that wheat plant
[48:20] he said brother branham said there's the
[48:21] book of life
[48:23] there's the they're denoted or brought
[48:25] the revelation of jesus christ because
[48:27] the bible is the complete revelation
[48:31] of jesus christ
[48:35] amen the complete revelation
[48:39] but there is a portion of that
[48:42] is the eternal life record
[48:45] it doesn't mean that all they're on that
[48:47] weren't but names can be removed and
[48:49] we're going to get into this wednesday
[48:51] and what names are saved or what names
[48:53] are not but names can be removed from
[48:55] the book of life but they cannot be
[48:57] removed from the eternal record
[48:59] of his own life
[49:04] so
[49:04] so that that creates people i'm thankful
[49:06] we had a message in this hour to unveil
[49:08] this to us we wouldn't catch it
[49:11] because it sets the bride in her
[49:12] position
[49:14] because this is what the book of the
[49:15] revelation is all about
[49:18] okay
[49:19] so reading again and this is the record
[49:21] that god has given to us eternal life
[49:23] and this life is in his son
[49:27] he that hath the son
[49:29] i want you to notice this life is in his
[49:31] son what was he the seed
[49:34] royal seed
[49:36] god himself
[49:38] veiled in a body of clay manifesting
[49:40] himself through the flesh made him god
[49:43] the son
[49:45] amen are you with me
[49:46] all right
[49:47] then then this
[49:50] son is that royal seed
[49:53] i'm going to come into a little more on
[49:54] that because it's a purpose of god in
[49:57] the revealing of this book there's a
[50:00] threefold purpose
[50:03] amen and this is what we've got to know
[50:05] and spend more time in that so we'll
[50:07] just see how far god goes with this but
[50:10] he that hath the son
[50:12] hath the seed
[50:14] remember the bride is the seed
[50:18] amen
[50:19] amen i
[50:20] you you just you've got if you don't
[50:22] catch that revelation you'll never catch
[50:24] if you don't catch that revelation
[50:25] you'll never see yourself
[50:29] as you ought to see it
[50:30] that's god revealed to you are you seed
[50:35] amen amen because it's the seed
[50:40] that opens that is the open word
[50:44] in the soul
[50:47] okay
[50:48] so he that hath the son hath
[50:51] life that's not human life that's
[50:54] eternal life
[50:56] hath life
[50:58] and he that hath not the son of god hath
[51:01] not life i want you to turn with me now
[51:03] to genesis
[51:05] so that's my message the title the
[51:07] message of the little book the open book
[51:09] the opened record
[51:11] and my subject is
[51:13] part of this subject is to gather his
[51:16] bride together
[51:20] to gather to gather his bride together
[51:22] and see that we are seeing
[51:25] past the curtain of time
[51:29] so genesis 1.
[51:31] let's get into this genesis 1.
[51:38] genesis 1 26.
[51:42] let's go right back to the record let's
[51:44] go back to the original
[51:48] we'll see here i pray god will just help
[51:51] us to truly
[51:52] catch a revelation of this in our day
[51:54] because this is the message of the hour
[51:58] all right genesis chapter 1 verse 26 and
[52:02] god said let us make man in our image
[52:06] after our likeness
[52:08] and let them have dominion over the fish
[52:10] of the sea and over the fowl of the air
[52:12] and over the cattle and over all the
[52:14] earth and over every creeping thing that
[52:16] creepeth upon the earth verse 27 so god
[52:20] created man in his own
[52:22] image
[52:24] now you're looking what you're going to
[52:26] read in the image of god created he him
[52:29] male and female created he them
[52:32] there is the image of god
[52:37] not just male
[52:39] male and female
[52:41] amen the image of god he said let's put
[52:44] that in man because i am a man i put
[52:47] that in man and but i'm both male and
[52:49] female and i'm going to express myself
[52:51] here
[52:52] the same
[52:53] i'm going to create a man because
[52:56] i have a i have a
[52:58] purpose
[53:00] in expressing myself this way amen
[53:04] so male and female created he them
[53:06] that's the image of god and now we come
[53:08] over here to chapter two
[53:11] and verse two now we're in the seventh
[53:13] day
[53:16] hello
[53:18] now we're in the seventh day and he said
[53:20] on the seventh day god ended his work
[53:26] i just i just can't keep commenting on
[53:28] all this i won't get done
[53:30] so god ended his work i'm just saying
[53:31] lord just quicken it to him god ended
[53:34] his work which he had made and he rested
[53:37] on the seventh day from all his work
[53:38] seventh day was a day of sabbath
[53:44] amen
[53:45] and where is our who is our sabbath
[53:48] our sabbath is the holy spirit
[53:52] that is our rest
[53:54] he that enters into his rest which is
[53:57] the holy spirit has ceased from his own
[53:59] labor just like god did on his in his
[54:01] day
[54:02] amen
[54:04] all right but we also know
[54:07] okay well i will go there right now like
[54:09] i say i can't keep commenting
[54:11] okay ended his work which he had made on
[54:13] the and he rested on the seventh day
[54:15] from all his works
[54:18] then i want to go to
[54:21] verse seven and the lord form man
[54:25] man was spirit he was in the image and
[54:27] but but god the lord god formed man of
[54:30] the dust he just took up some dust
[54:33] there's me
[54:36] are you with me
[54:37] he said in god the lord god formed man
[54:39] of the dust of the ground he formed him
[54:42] now how long he took or what he did i'm
[54:44] not i just blew that because brother
[54:46] brown said it like that he said there's
[54:47] another one
[54:49] and there's another one
[54:52] and he said on the seventh day excuse me
[54:54] and in the lord god for man of the dusty
[54:57] ground and breathed into his nostrils
[54:58] the breath of what life
[55:01] and man became a living
[55:03] soul
[55:05] third realm
[55:08] third realm
[55:10] your triune being
[55:12] first realm is flesh second realm of
[55:13] spirit
[55:15] but the third realm only the bride can
[55:16] go into
[55:18] that third pull is the opening of the
[55:20] word
[55:23] amen all right it takes the word to do
[55:25] it it took a message it took the turning
[55:30] it took a turning from prophet to his
[55:31] prophecy
[55:34] amen are you with me
[55:36] all right
[55:40] and became man became a living soul then
[55:43] we go over to verse 21
[55:47] and the lord god calls the d and he says
[55:49] not good verse 18 the lord said it's not
[55:51] good that man should dwell alone
[55:53] god's speaking here's his here's his
[55:55] image it's not good that it's got good
[55:58] that man should dwell alone he's saying
[55:59] it's not good that i dwell alone
[56:04] i will make him a help meet
[56:06] i'll make him a help meet m-e-e-t just
[56:10] for him just what he has need of
[56:13] to express him
[56:14] to be a help to him
[56:16] and alex because it's going to be a man
[56:18] with a womb
[56:22] going to carry my life
[56:24] amen
[56:25] so he said now i will make him a help
[56:27] meet for him okay then in the lord god
[56:30] 21st verse and the lord god caused a
[56:32] deep sleep to fall upon adam and he
[56:35] slept and he took one of his ribs and
[56:37] closed up the flesh thereof
[56:40] and the rib which the lord god had taken
[56:42] from man made he a woman
[56:44] and brought her unto the man
[56:47] amen he brought her
[56:51] unto the man
[56:52] and adam said this is now bone of my
[56:55] bones flesh of my flesh
[56:58] and he could have said what brother
[57:00] branham said on the masterpiece she is
[57:02] him
[57:05] but he said that he said that because
[57:07] she was called woman because she was
[57:09] taken out of man
[57:12] to what was she who was she
[57:15] she was adam
[57:17] expressed in another form
[57:20] all right and so therefore shall a man
[57:23] leave his mother father and mother and
[57:25] shall cleave unto his wife
[57:28] god's still expressing himself here i
[57:31] hope we're seeing the the mystery being
[57:33] expressed here that god
[57:36] has unfolded right in the
[57:38] beginning because here's the original
[57:41] and it comes back to revelation
[57:43] he's alpha and he's the omega
[57:47] therefore shall a man leave his father
[57:49] and mother and he shall cleave unto his
[57:51] wife and they shall be one flesh the
[57:54] prophet said i'll just jump ahead a
[57:55] little bit he said the head and the body
[57:57] have united they're no longer twain they
[58:00] are one flesh
[58:03] when could he say that
[58:05] after the message
[58:07] of this hour

[58:12] produce that
[58:14] amen right back

[59:53] won't have any beauty that we should
[59:54] desire him he's despised and rejected
[59:57] amen so is he today when he steps down
[59:59] here in the bride form he still despise
[1:00:02] rejected it shall be bitter to your
[1:00:05] belly
[1:00:08] all right
[1:00:09] he's despised rejected he's acquainted
[1:00:11] with grief isn't that interesting we say
[1:00:13] oh he shouldn't have any grief but he's
[1:00:15] acquainted with grief
[1:00:18] and we hid as it were our faces from him
[1:00:21] he was despised and we esteemed him not
[1:00:26] surely he hath borne our griefs he's
[1:00:28] carried our sorrows yet we did esteem
[1:00:31] him stricken smitten of god smitten of
[1:00:34] god
[1:00:35] and afflicted he was wounded for our
[1:00:37] transgressions he was bruised for our
[1:00:40] iniquities the chastisement of our peace
[1:00:43] was upon him and with his stripes we are
[1:00:47] are
[1:00:48] healed
[1:00:49] amen
[1:00:51] now
[1:00:52] verse 8
[1:00:54] and you can read how he's oppressed as a
[1:00:56] lamb to the slaughter the sheep before
[1:00:58] shears verse eight he was taken from
[1:01:00] prison and from judgments now watch
[1:01:05] i'll just say this ahead of time when
[1:01:06] jesus christ our
[1:01:09] redeemer went to calvary he was had both
[1:01:11] he was both male and female
[1:01:15] she the bride was in him
[1:01:18] amen all right
[1:01:20] he was the second adam
[1:01:24] that's why he had to come through a
[1:01:26] woman i don't have time to describe that
[1:01:28] you know that why he had to do come
[1:01:30] through a woman to take that off the to
[1:01:32] take that
[1:01:34] uh well to take the stain off of it
[1:01:37] he had to come through a woman to be a
[1:01:38] redeemer satan couldn't get to that
[1:01:40] woman first god did
[1:01:43] okay
[1:01:44] and satan couldn't get to us first god
[1:01:46] did
[1:01:48] at the end here he
[1:01:50] couldn't amen
[1:01:53] that's why he kept it hid
[1:01:56] all right now let's go here and he was
[1:01:58] taken from prison from judgment and who
[1:02:01] shall declare watch here she is who
[1:02:03] shall declare his generation
[1:02:06] for he was cut off out of the land of
[1:02:08] the living and for the transgression of
[1:02:10] my people was he stricken
[1:02:13] verse 10
[1:02:15] we want to see her again yet it pleased
[1:02:17] the lord to bruise him he hath put him
[1:02:19] to grief
[1:02:20] when thou shall make his
[1:02:23] soul
[1:02:26] an offering for sin
[1:02:29] he shall see his seed
[1:02:32] and he shall he shall prolong his days
[1:02:36] and the pleasure of the lord shall
[1:02:37] prosper in his hand
[1:02:41] first peter 2 9. i want to speak i want
[1:02:44] you to hold this word generation here
[1:02:46] just a minute and go with me to first
[1:02:48] peter
[1:02:50] generation let me just read first peter
[1:02:52] first and then generate first peter
[1:02:55] and i'll give you the meaning of that
[1:02:56] generation there and we don't have time
[1:02:58] to speak that i preached a message on it
[1:03:00] two or three years ago here on
[1:03:02] the generation
[1:03:04] first peter 2
[1:03:07] 9
[1:03:07] but you are a chosen generation
[1:03:11] hallelujah you are a chosen generation a
[1:03:16] royal priesthood
[1:03:18] a
[1:03:19] holy nation
[1:03:21] a peculiar people that you should show
[1:03:24] forth the praises of him who hath called
[1:03:27] you out of darkness thy light has come
[1:03:30] out of he's called you out of that
[1:03:33] in out of dark denominationalism the
[1:03:36] prophet said
[1:03:39] out of darkness into his marvelous light
[1:03:44] all right
[1:03:45] now a generation means a kind brother
[1:03:47] brandon made a statement in the church
[1:03:49] age book she was of him she is she come
[1:03:52] from him she came he as he was the word
[1:03:55] made flesh as the seed of god manifested
[1:03:57] and she came from him he she came from
[1:03:59] the same source
[1:04:02] and and brother brown and the scripture
[1:04:03] said every seed shall bring forth of its
[1:04:06] kind
[1:04:08] he shall see his seed and every seed
[1:04:10] shall bring forth of its kind
[1:04:13] you can't plant a corn seed and expect
[1:04:16] to get cauliflower
[1:04:18] you plant a corn you get corn
[1:04:20] amen you plant it in the right kind of
[1:04:22] ground and it's going to produce fruit
[1:04:25] it's going to bring forth of itself life
[1:04:27] that was in that original seed comes up
[1:04:29] through that corn back to many seeds
[1:04:33] it's the life we're dealing with in this
[1:04:35] little book
[1:04:36] the eternal life of himself so the
[1:04:39] generation is kind it's a kind kind the
[1:04:42] same kind it's the same race
[1:04:46] it's his family
[1:04:47] a generation is a family
[1:04:50] okay
[1:04:51] come
[1:04:52] he they've come from the same source
[1:04:55] meaning same source
[1:04:57] an offspring
[1:04:59] and brother brown said it's a super race
[1:05:03] and another place he said it's the royal
[1:05:05] seed the royal race
[1:05:07] it's a royal
[1:05:10] race
[1:05:10] prophet said in this day he would
[1:05:12] uncover it in this day he would bring
[1:05:14] forth a royal bride which would be the
[1:05:16] royal seed to the royal promised son he
[1:05:19] said that's the promise that's who's to
[1:05:22] come in this day he said
[1:05:26] amen all right now
[1:05:30] in the message who is this melchizedek
[1:05:36] who is this melchizedek notice
[1:05:38] now remember brother brown said the
[1:05:40] masterpiece
[1:05:41] there's your masterpiece but he said
[1:05:43] there is another masterpiece
[1:05:45] in the making
[1:05:47] it was taken out of that masterpiece
[1:05:52] amen watch god because all the way from
[1:05:54] from from genesis he begins to restore
[1:05:57] and he first restores the adam again
[1:05:59] second adam are you with me then he
[1:06:02] brings out of her out of him
[1:06:08] this is jesus christ all right so now he
[1:06:12] said notice like the sculpture
[1:06:14] he hides
[1:06:16] he hides with a mask over it that's what
[1:06:19] god has done
[1:06:21] to this age it's been hid
[1:06:26] now remember brother branham said but
[1:06:27] he's come in full view of you hid
[1:06:31] but you see him he said
[1:06:34] but unless you're a part of him others
[1:06:36] don't see him
[1:06:38] because he's hid
[1:06:40] so he's been hid today but he's come in
[1:06:42] full view
[1:06:43] of somebody
[1:06:46] because the prophet said he's come in
[1:06:48] full view of you bride
[1:06:52] all right
[1:06:55] now he said it's been hid god has done
[1:06:58] he's been hid all these things have been
[1:06:59] hid and well watch it's been hid but
[1:07:02] it's supposed to be revealed it's
[1:07:05] supposed to be revealed in
[1:07:07] this
[1:07:08] age
[1:07:11] now the bible says that it will they
[1:07:14] will be revealed in the latter times
[1:07:17] they will be they who's they
[1:07:21] they will be revealed in the latter
[1:07:23] times it's like a sculpture keeping his
[1:07:25] piece of work all covered over until the
[1:07:28] time he takes the mask off of it and
[1:07:32] there it is
[1:07:38] ah
[1:07:39] good at me
[1:07:40] the message of the seventh angel
[1:07:45] all right
[1:07:47] all right god and morphy now now now
[1:07:49] excuse me i'm my head and that's what
[1:07:51] the bible has been it's been a great
[1:07:53] it's been a work of god it's been a work
[1:07:56] of god it's been god's achievement other
[1:07:58] words
[1:08:00] it's been a work of god that's been
[1:08:02] covered up
[1:08:03] and it's been hid since the foundation
[1:08:05] of the world
[1:08:07] and its sevenfold mystery
[1:08:12] and god promised in this day at the age
[1:08:15] of the laodicean church this day seventh
[1:08:18] day in the this day at the age of and
[1:08:21] the age of his later
[1:08:23] in church he would take the mask off the
[1:08:25] whole thing
[1:08:28] and we could see it
[1:08:30] what a glorious thing
[1:08:32] god and morphy
[1:08:34] god above us god with us god and morphy
[1:08:37] above us god with us god in us
[1:08:40] the condescending
[1:08:41] of god
[1:08:44] great is the mystery of godliness
[1:08:47] all right
[1:08:54] we see that
[1:08:56] then he's got to unveil himself there's
[1:08:58] another masterpiece in the making
[1:09:02] revelation 19 7
[1:09:04] you know that scripture very well
[1:09:07] but we're going to i'm going to read it
[1:09:09] again
[1:09:11] let us be glad and rejoice and give
[1:09:13] honor to him for the marriage of the
[1:09:15] lamb
[1:09:18] is
[1:09:20] come
[1:09:22] and we don't need to understand if it is
[1:09:23] or not because the prophet has
[1:09:24] identified it is
[1:09:27] and he said and he said let us be glad
[1:09:29] to rejoice and give honor to him for the
[1:09:31] marriage of the lamb is come and his
[1:09:32] wife hath made herself ready
[1:09:35] and to her was granted
[1:09:38] that she should be arrayed and find
[1:09:39] lennon what made her ready the true
[1:09:42] baptism of the holy ghost made her ready
[1:09:46] that was a pentecost
[1:09:48] amen that's the pentecostal blessing
[1:09:52] i'm real pentecostal
[1:09:54] i'm not a denominational shuck
[1:09:56] i believe the baptism of the holy ghost
[1:09:58] brother branham said it was it's the new
[1:10:00] birth it's god birthing you
[1:10:04] it's the revelation of jesus christ in
[1:10:05] you because you're the seed
[1:10:07] and the seed can't be quickened and
[1:10:09] reveal anything else but jesus christ in
[1:10:11] you
[1:10:12] and he identifies himself by hearing and
[1:10:14] keeping the word of god
[1:10:17] all right
[1:10:18] now
[1:10:24] and to her was granted anybody else to
[1:10:27] her was granted
[1:10:29] that she should be arrayed and find
[1:10:31] lenin clean and white for the fine lenin
[1:10:34] is the righteousness of saints
[1:10:38] amen and he saith unto me right
[1:10:42] blessed are they they which are called
[1:10:45] unto the marriage supper of the lamb
[1:10:48] and he said unto me
[1:10:50] and he saith unto me these are the true
[1:10:52] sayings of god
[1:10:54] amen
[1:11:01] and i fell at his feet to worship him
[1:11:02] others going to worship the angel that's
[1:11:04] revealing this to him
[1:11:06] amen we don't worship brother branham we
[1:11:09] don't worship that seventh angel hello
[1:11:15] and he said unto me see thou do it not i
[1:11:17] am thy fellow servant and of thy
[1:11:19] brethren that have the testimony of
[1:11:21] jesus who has the testimony of jesus in
[1:11:23] here
[1:11:27] then you're a true witness
[1:11:29] if you can truly have his testimony
[1:11:31] you're a true witness and it's by your
[1:11:32] testimony you've overcome and by the
[1:11:34] blood of the lamb and your
[1:11:38] testimony all right he said
[1:11:42] and i am thy fellow servant that brother
[1:11:43] have the testimony of jesus that's the
[1:11:45] bride worship god for the testimony of
[1:11:48] jesus is the spirit of prophecy
[1:11:53] long as that prophecy is with the word
[1:11:54] you're okay
[1:11:57] because then you're speaking what the
[1:11:58] prophet said
[1:12:01] all right
[1:12:03] all right
[1:12:06] now i could go the next verse because
[1:12:08] we've seen it and i saw heaven opened
[1:12:13] i didn't hear an amen
[1:12:15] brother braham said heaven consists of
[1:12:17] the word where you came from and if
[1:12:19] you're being ambassador to heaven from
[1:12:20] heaven from heaven all heavens behind
[1:12:22] you
[1:12:24] we saw heaven open
[1:12:26] and behold a horse is a power
[1:12:30] wasn't a dark one it wasn't a black one
[1:12:32] it was a white one
[1:12:34] amen are you with me
[1:12:36] all right
[1:12:37] i won't go any further than that but he
[1:12:38] already said so in revelations 10 11.
[1:12:42] you must prophesy again
[1:12:44] brother braham said she'll ride the
[1:12:45] trail again
[1:12:47] following him all right i won't go into
[1:12:49] all that but let's go here a little
[1:12:51] further
[1:12:54] now
[1:12:55] the bible this bible
[1:12:59] in the message of the church age brother
[1:13:01] branham makes it very clear he says
[1:13:05] that this
[1:13:07] he said a single grain is planted to the
[1:13:09] end that a single grain of wheat will
[1:13:11] produce and multiply itself through a
[1:13:12] certain process during a certain period
[1:13:14] of time
[1:13:15] that single seed will die but in dying
[1:13:18] the life that was in it will come up the
[1:13:20] life we're told notice we're speaking
[1:13:22] about the life not the plant the life
[1:13:25] that was in it will come up
[1:13:28] up into a plant which in turn will be
[1:13:30] the bearer the plant will be the bearer
[1:13:32] or carrier of that life
[1:13:36] which is to come back to originality in
[1:13:39] a multiplied form
[1:13:42] jesus the great royal seed died the
[1:13:45] matchless one who had his who is the
[1:13:47] life of the church stands in the midst
[1:13:49] of the church in all seven ages giving
[1:13:50] him his giving his life it's the church
[1:13:54] giving his life to the church the
[1:13:56] carrier or the bearer he gives his life
[1:13:59] she's a woman other words are you with
[1:14:00] me the life the church is a woman she's
[1:14:03] a bearer she's a carrier
[1:14:05] of that life
[1:14:07] all right
[1:14:08] so at the end of his uh
[1:14:10] to the
[1:14:11] carrier bearer give his life to the
[1:14:13] church to the end that his very life
[1:14:16] will be reproduced in bodies like and
[1:14:18] unto his in the resurrection
[1:14:21] it is at the resurrection that the royal
[1:14:23] seed will see many royal seeds like unto
[1:14:26] himself the royal seed will see many
[1:14:29] royal seeds like unto himself
[1:14:34] all right
[1:14:36] and they will even
[1:14:37] they will be even as he is for said john
[1:14:40] we shall see we shall be like him
[1:14:43] now then the record of this wheat plant
[1:14:46] whose end is to reproduce the original
[1:14:48] seed in a multiplied form this wheat
[1:14:51] plant is the book of life
[1:14:56] all right now listen just keep keep with
[1:14:59] me
[1:15:00] i repeat the history or record of this
[1:15:04] wheat plant is the book of life of which
[1:15:06] a part of the book of life is the record
[1:15:09] of eternal life
[1:15:12] a part of that life
[1:15:14] is a record of that plant is a record of
[1:15:17] eternal life and he said a part of an
[1:15:20] apart
[1:15:21] and he said it's a record of eternal
[1:15:23] life and that is a section of the book
[1:15:26] of life
[1:15:30] now we could go back into several places
[1:15:32] here and show you that section is the
[1:15:34] section of his bride and i will a couple
[1:15:36] places here all right then it's a
[1:15:39] section of the book of life this
[1:15:42] is convincingly seen by the examination
[1:15:45] of the wheat plant so he goes on to tell
[1:15:47] about the wheat plant now he says no
[1:15:49] names will be blotted out of the book of
[1:15:52] eternal life that is another record a
[1:15:54] section though contained in the book of
[1:15:57] life
[1:15:58] and i just read you the scripture in
[1:16:00] first john this is the record that he's
[1:16:01] given us eternal life all right so it's
[1:16:04] another he said is another record in
[1:16:06] that book of life
[1:16:10] all right
[1:16:10] then he said
[1:16:12] he goes on to express it
[1:16:16] and so the record of the church the
[1:16:18] wheat the plant
[1:16:19] he said and and not all the plant not
[1:16:23] all the plant will give into this
[1:16:24] wednesday because not all the plant is
[1:16:27] is used in the harvest
[1:16:29] and so with the church
[1:16:32] he said all the church is not bride
[1:16:36] all the wheat plant is not bride
[1:16:39] hello
[1:16:43] he said and neither is it all given
[1:16:45] eternal life
[1:16:49] in other words all the wheat plant
[1:16:51] there's some parts not given
[1:16:53] it just dies
[1:16:54] now given eternal life we'll come into
[1:16:56] the given part on wednesday
[1:16:58] i'm not going into that this morning
[1:17:01] all right but i'm wanting to make it
[1:17:03] known to you
[1:17:04] that your name was in a section a little
[1:17:07] book a section of this record of
[1:17:11] the book of life it was in another
[1:17:13] record and that's an eternal life record
[1:17:15] which brother brown said is a section
[1:17:17] and the names in that book that section
[1:17:20] can never be removed under any
[1:17:22] circumstance now i'm going to say that
[1:17:24] i've got two other places to tell you
[1:17:26] that but i think i'll just say it out at
[1:17:28] the same time
[1:17:29] if you wonder where it is we go right
[1:17:30] back from page 265 read from page 265
[1:17:34] in this book if you have the other book
[1:17:36] it's going to be a different page number
[1:17:38] like we it'll find it but at 265 all the
[1:17:41] way in i'm on page 284.
[1:17:44] so in through there he keeps he lays it
[1:17:47] out perfectly
[1:17:49] where the bride is she's found in this
[1:17:53] little book
[1:17:56] that's why the message of the seventh
[1:17:57] angel
[1:17:59] was the message of that little book
[1:18:05] but when he begins to bring that message
[1:18:07] it causes separation
[1:18:10] amen it separates the rest of the wheat
[1:18:13] plant from the record of eternal life
[1:18:17] because only she can pick up that
[1:18:19] ministry because she is a part of him
[1:18:22] as bride
[1:18:24] there's others we'll get into it more
[1:18:26] there's others that'll get eternal life
[1:18:28] at the white throne judgment because
[1:18:30] their name was found in the book of life
[1:18:32] but anyone in the record of the section
[1:18:35] of that book which is the bride section
[1:18:38] only the bright section is the only one
[1:18:40] that's going in the rapture
[1:18:44] the first resurrection and so the rest
[1:18:47] of this
[1:18:48] seven ages without us and without this
[1:18:50] ministry without this opening of this
[1:18:52] word
[1:18:53] is not made perfect
[1:18:56] you see our ministry
[1:18:58] is not made perfect without us
[1:19:00] perfect mean mature or complete it's not
[1:19:03] complete without the book being taken
[1:19:05] and the claiming of his possession
[1:19:11] paul even said
[1:19:12] the ones in the old testament were made
[1:19:14] perfect i speak of barack and samson and
[1:19:16] jeopardy and all these things he said
[1:19:18] and and which the world's not worthy of
[1:19:20] and he said without us today he said
[1:19:23] living here under the first coming of
[1:19:25] christ and seeing the son of god
[1:19:27] manifest and to realize what it was
[1:19:29] without us they can't be made perfect
[1:19:34] amen do you see where we're standing
[1:19:37] today
[1:19:38] where we're at
[1:19:40] all right so i'm not going to go he said
[1:19:42] but no names no names will be blotted
[1:19:45] out of the book of eternal life that is
[1:19:47] another record though contained in the
[1:19:49] book of life it's another record
[1:19:54] amen that's why it referred to it as a
[1:19:57] little book and brother branham also
[1:19:59] referred we'll get to it just a moment
[1:20:01] what is the bride book
[1:20:06] all right now so i'm gonna i'm gonna lay
[1:20:08] that down in a minute and i'll try to
[1:20:10] we'll come into more of not more of that
[1:20:12] necessarily but more of and well just
[1:20:15] wednesday lord willing you pray for me
[1:20:17] who are these other righteous that are
[1:20:19] given life in the white throne judgment
[1:20:23] because it's not the bride standing
[1:20:25] before him in judgment of the white
[1:20:26] throne judgment she's judging she's
[1:20:28] already in the throne
[1:20:30] this books
[1:20:31] her book has already been opened
[1:20:34] her book has already been opened brother
[1:20:36] brown brings that out in the rising of
[1:20:37] the sun he said he said there they are
[1:20:39] standing before but notice the bride's
[1:20:41] already with him in the throne so when
[1:20:43] was her book opened
[1:20:47] at the message of the seventh angel it
[1:20:50] was sent to bring this bride to her
[1:20:52] completion to the complete revelation
[1:20:54] jesus christ said i'm gonna i purpose in
[1:20:56] myself i will have a bride it's my heart
[1:20:59] purpose
[1:21:01] of my choosing
[1:21:02] he is sovereign in his choosing you've
[1:21:04] got to recognize that because he chooses
[1:21:07] by foreknowledge
[1:21:09] he's elected by foreknowledge
[1:21:12] amen first peter
[1:21:14] one two
[1:21:16] elect according to foreknowledge
[1:21:19] all right
[1:21:22] now
[1:21:24] now we'll jump over here
[1:21:27] into a message
[1:21:29] called the ephesian church age
[1:21:31] paragraph 80 verse 2 the true church of
[1:21:33] jesus christ the bride
[1:21:36] the true church of jesus christ the
[1:21:38] bride is likened to pure gold
[1:21:41] her righteousness is his righteousness
[1:21:44] her attributes are his own glorious
[1:21:46] attributes her identity is found in him
[1:21:50] what she is well excuse me what he is
[1:21:54] she is to reflect
[1:21:58] what he has
[1:21:59] she is to manifest
[1:22:03] there is no fault in her
[1:22:12] i wonder if we're looking past the
[1:22:13] curtain of time if we're seeing past the
[1:22:15] curtain
[1:22:17] i wonder if we're seeing a message in
[1:22:19] this hour that's bringing this bride
[1:22:21] together
[1:22:22] a gathering
[1:22:24] could it be
[1:22:26] i'll well i won't say that i'll come to
[1:22:28] it in a minute i'll get ahead of myself
[1:22:31] what is what he is okay
[1:22:34] she is glorious there's no fault in her
[1:22:36] she is glorious within and without
[1:22:40] she is glorious within
[1:22:43] and without well brother david i don't
[1:22:45] feel so glorious i got all kinds of
[1:22:46] mistakes listen
[1:22:48] if she's glorious within what's god
[1:22:51] looking at you through
[1:22:55] all right
[1:22:56] now
[1:22:57] she is glorious see we're not speaking
[1:22:59] about people i get up and sound pretty
[1:23:01] harsh when i when i what am i looking at
[1:23:03] i'm seeing a spirit not individuals
[1:23:07] individual has nothing to do with it i'm
[1:23:09] the individual like they're an
[1:23:10] individual full of mistakes and failures
[1:23:12] and faults and but what are we looking
[1:23:14] at
[1:23:15] we're identifying a spirit this message
[1:23:17] just got so perfected so complete it's
[1:23:19] such a such a revelated thing that we're
[1:23:22] recognizing spirits that used to hide
[1:23:24] themselves
[1:23:26] are being exposed
[1:23:29] why because we're in the light
[1:23:32] i don't feel bad if it sounds like i
[1:23:34] really come against you hard
[1:23:36] i'm not against you
[1:23:37] i'm against that spirit that's trying to
[1:23:39] kill you
[1:23:41] i'm against that spirit that's trying to
[1:23:42] take you away from the true revelation
[1:23:44] of this word for the season
[1:23:47] it's a spirit everything even the
[1:23:48] clothes you wear identify a spirit
[1:23:52] everything got a spirit behind every
[1:23:53] word you speak is motivated by some
[1:23:55] spirit
[1:23:57] it's a thought first before it's a word
[1:23:59] we ought to recognize this brother
[1:24:01] sister
[1:24:03] see
[1:24:05] all right
[1:24:07] i'm going to get off my trails i'm like
[1:24:09] i mean i don't want to get off the track
[1:24:10] here
[1:24:11] so she is glorious within and without
[1:24:13] from beginning to end
[1:24:15] from beginning
[1:24:17] to ending she is the work of her lord
[1:24:20] and all his works are perfect
[1:24:26] you believe that
[1:24:27] he said he made your way perfect too
[1:24:30] being in him how can your way not be
[1:24:32] perfect
[1:24:33] how can your way then not be sinless
[1:24:34] before him
[1:24:40] amen
[1:24:44] beginning to ending she is the work of
[1:24:45] her lord and all his works are perfect
[1:24:48] now you think i got that for myself the
[1:24:50] bible said his ways are perfect and he's
[1:24:52] made our ways perfect go back to psalms
[1:24:53] and find out if he didn't say that
[1:24:56] amen it's not my word that's the word of
[1:24:58] the lord
[1:24:59] okay
[1:25:02] from beginning to ending she's the work
[1:25:04] of her lord and all his works are
[1:25:05] perfect in fact in her
[1:25:08] is
[1:25:09] summed
[1:25:11] up
[1:25:14] is summed up
[1:25:17] and manifested the eternal wisdom and
[1:25:20] purpose of god
[1:25:22] in him is perfect fulfillment
[1:25:25] amen though once we esteemed him not now
[1:25:27] we love him with joy unspeakable and
[1:25:29] full of glory in the midst of the church
[1:25:31] he stands and we will sing his praises
[1:25:33] for he's the mighty conqueror he's the
[1:25:35] head over the church which he's the head
[1:25:37] over the church which is his bride he
[1:25:40] bought the bride
[1:25:42] he owns her
[1:25:43] she is his and his alone he cares for
[1:25:47] her he is our king and we are his and we
[1:25:50] are his kingdom we are his word made
[1:25:54] life his kingdom
[1:25:58] in
[1:25:59] he said
[1:26:00] and then he says his eternal possession
[1:26:04] then consider this since it was the
[1:26:06] blood of god that was shed for you it is
[1:26:08] perfect blood and if the perfect blood
[1:26:10] was
[1:26:11] and if the perfect blood is loosing us
[1:26:13] from the power and bondage and
[1:26:15] defilement of sin how do you know it is
[1:26:17] because you have his life
[1:26:21] it identifies that you've come through
[1:26:23] that blood
[1:26:26] not just you to say you have you believe
[1:26:28] you have but where's the evidence that
[1:26:30] you have
[1:26:31] where is the evidence that except and
[1:26:33] read and makes known that your faith is
[1:26:35] his
[1:26:37] you say what are you talking about the
[1:26:39] token
[1:26:42] his own life
[1:26:44] testifies you've come through the blood
[1:26:46] you have to worry about it anymore let
[1:26:48] off the pressure i have the token i have
[1:26:50] the very life of christ living in me the
[1:26:52] very literal life he can't deny me he
[1:26:55] can't deny it
[1:26:58] then you can apply it
[1:27:01] amen
[1:27:04] so he said in them he said he said then
[1:27:07] that blood is loosing us from the power
[1:27:10] and bondage and defilement of sin then
[1:27:12] the losing is perfect and it's complete
[1:27:15] there is now therefore no condemnation
[1:27:19] amen he said who shall lay anything to
[1:27:21] the charge of god's elect it is god that
[1:27:24] declares us righteous justified
[1:27:28] and then who is he that condemns
[1:27:31] amen is that right
[1:27:34] okay
[1:27:37] now
[1:27:39] i just went through
[1:27:42] what i wanted to go through the church
[1:27:44] age so invisible union remember that
[1:27:47] what he remember what
[1:27:49] he said what time is it he said how many
[1:27:51] remember excuse me the message what time
[1:27:53] is it sir
[1:27:55] remember we talked about that
[1:27:57] what time is it sir
[1:28:01] how many heard it say amen congrats and
[1:28:04] says amen this was preached in
[1:28:06] shreveport 1965 invisible union he said
[1:28:10] amen was that exactly right amen then
[1:28:12] we've got i don't want you to miss this
[1:28:15] now then we have got in this last days
[1:28:20] the revelation
[1:28:22] for the message of the lord to gather
[1:28:24] his bride together
[1:28:27] no other age has it been promised
[1:28:31] it's promised in this age
[1:28:36] it's to gather his bride together i want
[1:28:38] you to turn with me
[1:28:40] to to thessalonians
[1:28:42] or at first turn with me to john
[1:28:44] 14.
[1:28:48] john chapter 14 very familiar scripture
[1:28:51] again verse 2 or verse 1. let your not
[1:28:53] your heart be troubled you believe in
[1:28:55] god believe also in me
[1:28:57] in my father's house are many dwelling
[1:28:59] places mansions
[1:29:01] are you with me
[1:29:04] you're a dwelling place of god
[1:29:06] many dwelling places bodies made up of
[1:29:08] many members is that right in my house
[1:29:11] in my father's house that's his kingdom
[1:29:13] that says that's his domain
[1:29:16] amen and who is his domain and where is
[1:29:18] his place of worship but where he put
[1:29:20] his name and where he put his name was
[1:29:21] in his bride
[1:29:23] in his body
[1:29:24] in himself
[1:29:28] all right then
[1:29:29] he didn't put it in a man he put it in
[1:29:31] himself
[1:29:33] and the birth of the word is himself in
[1:29:35] you then where he is there is my place
[1:29:37] of worship brother brahm said they
[1:29:39] worship him through the revelation of
[1:29:41] himself
[1:29:45] all right
[1:29:47] now
[1:29:48] he said in saint john in verse two in my
[1:29:50] father's house many mansions if it were
[1:29:52] not so i would have told you i go to
[1:29:54] prepare a place for you verse 3 and if i
[1:29:56] go
[1:29:57] and prepare a place for you i will come
[1:30:00] again
[1:30:01] [Applause]
[1:30:03] i will come again and receive you unto
[1:30:06] myself
[1:30:10] that where i am
[1:30:12] there's a purpose of me doing this
[1:30:14] there's a purpose in that mystery being
[1:30:15] revealed that where i am you may be also
[1:30:21] talk about god's grace talk about the
[1:30:23] goodness of god talk about a pro talk
[1:30:27] about the god getting through the
[1:30:28] message with the message
[1:30:30] i'm coming down to that in just a minute
[1:30:32] okay now first our second thessalonians
[1:30:36] chapter two
[1:30:38] second thessalonians chapter two
[1:30:43] this is like a little study a little a
[1:30:45] bit of a teaching here but ii
[1:30:46] thessalonians
[1:30:48] chapter 2
[1:30:51] watch what paul says in verse 2 verse 1
[1:30:53] chapter 2 verse 1 now we beseech you
[1:30:55] brethren by the what
[1:31:00] coming of our lord jesus christ and by
[1:31:04] our gathering our gathering brother
[1:31:07] braham said we have received the
[1:31:08] revelation the message of the hour for
[1:31:10] the gathering of the bride and by the
[1:31:13] gathering together
[1:31:15] unto him
[1:31:17] and what message was sent
[1:31:20] to bring us into that gathering there
[1:31:22] had to be a trumpet blown
[1:31:26] a trumpet denotes a gathering it means
[1:31:29] war but but the seventh trumpet sounded
[1:31:32] how many know that's true
[1:31:35] and it denotes a gathering
[1:31:39] a gathering of who
[1:31:42] the trumpet was a voice
[1:31:46] and it was the first trumpet we heard
[1:31:48] john heard it
[1:31:50] amen
[1:31:51] and the voice said something to john
[1:31:53] come up higher
[1:31:58] we sing the song don't we
[1:32:00] there's a there's a bride where the
[1:32:02] worshipping arise the worshipers are
[1:32:03] rising isn't there a rising up rising up
[1:32:13] all right these things may sound a
[1:32:15] little strange to you but
[1:32:17] there's a message in this day
[1:32:19] to take a bride home
[1:32:22] don't care what the world thinks about
[1:32:24] it
[1:32:26] to me
[1:32:27] that's my husband
[1:32:31] the word the message is my husband
[1:32:35] and he's come
[1:32:37] at nighttime
[1:32:39] to bring her out of that dark
[1:32:40] denominationalism like romeo did
[1:32:42] juliette
[1:32:45] and it's not a it's not it's a mystery
[1:32:47] to everyone but the bride
[1:32:50] he's come for her he didn't come for the
[1:32:51] rest of them
[1:32:52] he said this is bride time he said the
[1:32:55] the churches have denied the word they
[1:32:57] turned him out
[1:32:59] now he's turned the corner
[1:33:03] the opening of the seven seals with the
[1:33:04] turning of the corner
[1:33:08] in order for there to in order for that
[1:33:10] to be revealed there had to come a
[1:33:12] falling away first and there was
[1:33:16] the church had to deny the word in their
[1:33:18] midst and they did
[1:33:20] church natural
[1:33:21] so he could turn to that bride
[1:33:24] right at the time that he said god would
[1:33:26] choose to strike he did
[1:33:30] and there's a message went forth
[1:33:34] and this bride is in a revival and she's
[1:33:36] in a resurrection and she's raptured in
[1:33:39] a rapturing
[1:33:40] power and movement right now it's
[1:33:43] already begun inside of her
[1:33:45] and she has the assurance she's already
[1:33:46] included in it
[1:33:49] there's been a change
[1:33:50] and they that were ready
[1:33:52] matthew 25 10 they that were ready went
[1:33:55] in with him to the marriage
[1:34:00] and at that time there was there was a
[1:34:02] foolish virgin say we need some of your
[1:34:04] oil we need some of your oil
[1:34:08] they weren't ready
[1:34:10] they didn't have the oil
[1:34:16] but when she went into that marriage she
[1:34:18] began she began to be clothed with life
[1:34:21] because it was granted to her
[1:34:26] amen
[1:34:27] all right
[1:34:29] all right here we are and so now we come
[1:34:31] along here now watch
[1:34:33] so thessalonians said paul's speaking of
[1:34:35] the first coming he said we are being

[1:41:21] then we are being gathered by his coming
[1:41:25] glory to
[1:41:30] god don't just get dilatory and lazy on
[1:41:34] it
[1:41:35] if there's anything inside of your soul
[1:41:37] you better let god have that tug that's
[1:41:39] in your heart
[1:41:42] it's that little tug that god has to
[1:41:44] quicken it's that little tug that god
[1:41:46] has to he's sent to quicken amen that
[1:41:49] tug towards him it's a deep calling to

[1:41:56] perish and let go he's calling on you to
[1:41:59] let go of these things of the world and
[1:42:01] give yourself unreservedly to him
[1:42:06] amen
[1:42:09] amen amen and lay aside every little
[1:42:11] weight in the sin what is the weight in
[1:42:13] the sin when satan keeps pointing at you
[1:42:16] accusing you accusing you accusing you
[1:42:18] he says yeah i did that yeah i'm saying
[1:42:20] you're right
[1:42:22] no he isn't right because you don't
[1:42:24] realize who you really are of the soul
[1:42:26] you are himself god himself
[1:42:28] living in a body of clay
[1:42:34] and he said to lay aside that weight
[1:42:37] rebuke it refuse it
[1:42:40] i don't care if what he tries to come
[1:42:42] through your senses with reject it
[1:42:46] and your sense realm your senses of
[1:42:48] imagination memory reason memory and
[1:42:50] conscience and affection
[1:42:52] when he tries to use those things reject
[1:42:54] him oh he said i wish i could do that
[1:42:57] the word in you can do it
[1:43:00] you just need to take it and appropriate
[1:43:03] it then
[1:43:06] recognize your position that you're
[1:43:08] already seated in heavenly places in
[1:43:10] christ and deny that weight that thus so
[1:43:13] easily beset you and this sin
[1:43:19] i'm not i'm sinless but this old boy
[1:43:22] wasn't born again
[1:43:24] and if it wasn't for the power of god
[1:43:26] he'd go wild
[1:43:28] but it's the power of god that holds
[1:43:29] this under obedience to the word that's
[1:43:31] what romans that's what romans 11 8 11
[1:43:35] if the spirit that dwells in you that
[1:43:37] dwells in you he shall also quicken your
[1:43:38] mortal body brother brown said he'll
[1:43:40] bring it subject to the word if you
[1:43:42] don't see that happening something's
[1:43:44] wrong with your relationship with christ
[1:43:50] hallelujah all right
[1:43:55] okay some of this i'm gonna bypass
[1:44:03] it's the books even sealed in heaven
[1:44:09] the lamb was slain before the foundation
[1:44:10] of the world he took the book opened the
[1:44:13] seals opened the book
[1:44:15] tore off the seals sent it down to his
[1:44:18] sent it down not notice what he did he
[1:44:20] sent it down to earth to his seventh
[1:44:22] angel to reveal it to his people
[1:44:27] and there was a sword in my hand
[1:44:29] and it wasn't just a sword it was the
[1:44:32] king's sword it was the king
[1:44:36] when he cried
[1:44:38] king did
[1:44:40] seven thunder's other voices
[1:44:43] and it was time for that to be revealed
[1:44:45] now
[1:44:46] oh brother sisters brothers brothers oh
[1:44:48] brother oh brother don't tell us the
[1:44:49] seventh seal is open i beg your pardon
[1:44:52] it's open and it's in me revealed
[1:44:57] whether they like it or don't like it
[1:44:58] it's that denominating spirit of
[1:45:00] dominating woman that hates that message
[1:45:03] and she's against it and wherever is
[1:45:05] spoken she will be against it
[1:45:09] amen because that's denominational
[1:45:12] spirit has tried to infiltrate this
[1:45:14] message but it can't infiltrate the
[1:45:16] message of this book because you're the
[1:45:18] message of the book
[1:45:27] can't get to you
[1:45:30] already been set free what a
[1:45:32] resurrection this is
[1:45:35] we've had received the voice of his
[1:45:37] resurrection and we are voicing that
[1:45:39] voice
[1:45:40] of his resurrection we become that voice
[1:45:43] i'm jumping way out of my notes right
[1:45:45] now but i guess i'll have to because of
[1:45:47] time
[1:45:49] all right but i'm going to continue on
[1:45:51] here until i run out of time
[1:45:55] all right
[1:45:57] now
[1:45:59] there you are he send it down to seventh
[1:46:01] angel reveal it there you are
[1:46:03] oh the screams he said the shouts the
[1:46:05] hallelujahs the anointed the power the
[1:46:07] glory the manifestation
[1:46:13] watch what he says here
[1:46:15] but that he's talking about the dove
[1:46:17] message
[1:46:18] wings of a dove
[1:46:20] he's but he kept climbing
[1:46:24] he kept climbing
[1:46:26] enoch kept climbing he was walking with
[1:46:28] god brother brahma said is the light
[1:46:30] shone he just made one step higher the
[1:46:32] next one a little step a little higher
[1:46:34] and this one a little step a little
[1:46:35] higher
[1:46:37] and it was not
[1:46:39] for god took him
[1:46:42] god took him
[1:46:44] what does this message mean to you
[1:46:46] is it really alive to you do you really
[1:46:49] realize are you just playing church and
[1:46:50] have church hannity
[1:46:55] that's why brother brown said i call for
[1:46:57] men
[1:46:58] men of valor men of
[1:47:00] that's got the sword to step forward and
[1:47:02] slay these ungodly denominational
[1:47:04] philistines
[1:47:05] that want to rise up and blind your eyes
[1:47:08] where's where's the men like levite that
[1:47:10] levi that
[1:47:13] because that spirit entered into the
[1:47:14] camp he took a javelin
[1:47:19] are you with me i don't advocate killing
[1:47:21] anybody but it's time we stood for the
[1:47:23] word and had a testimony
[1:47:25] that's not my god that's a wrong spirit
[1:47:34] amen
[1:47:36] all right
[1:47:37] he kept climbing and finally he made it
[1:47:41] crippled
[1:47:42] wounded
[1:47:43] broken
[1:47:44] bruised but he fell in the camp
[1:47:48] with the message
[1:47:52] that was a great dove
[1:47:54] and we stand justified declared
[1:47:56] righteous in christ that's what
[1:47:58] justified means you know
[1:48:00] we stand justified in christ before him
[1:48:03] because he cannot pass judgment for he's
[1:48:05] already judged that body in which i'm a
[1:48:07] part of
[1:48:08] how am i a part of it here it is
[1:48:11] it's in me
[1:48:15] amen
[1:48:17] amen
[1:48:18] there's a message coming forth now and i
[1:48:21] pray god that you'll let the dove lead
[1:48:24] and i pray god this morning let the dove
[1:48:26] lead
[1:48:27] not your stinking thinking of your old
[1:48:30] carnal spirit
[1:48:32] let the dove lead
[1:48:35] that was pretty harsh you say horse it
[1:48:36] is it's stinking thinking because we've
[1:48:39] got we've got this old human element
[1:48:41] here
[1:48:42] human mind that the bible already said
[1:48:44] is your enemy
[1:48:47] that human spirit
[1:48:49] is not the mind of god
[1:48:53] amen
[1:48:54] you receive the mind of god when the
[1:48:56] seed in your soul had been opened
[1:48:59] that's the opening of the book
[1:49:04] all right
[1:49:06] now
[1:49:08] because it was a third pull
[1:49:10] you have a pull you have a tug
[1:49:12] and you're wanting something you're
[1:49:14] searching and there's an answer to it
[1:49:16] it's called the third pull
[1:49:20] amen is that right certainly it's right
[1:49:24] all right now
[1:49:26] i want to get into this right here if i
[1:49:28] don't get into anything else today
[1:49:30] and i believe i will but i wanted to get
[1:49:32] into this threefold purpose i want you
[1:49:34] to listen to me carefully
[1:49:44] we know that the prophet does
[1:49:46] we know
[1:49:48] that the messenger the seventh angel the
[1:49:50] messenger of malachi 4 revelation 10 7
[1:49:52] does two things i'm just going to brief
[1:49:53] this just a moment
[1:49:58] and he says this now we know the
[1:49:59] messenger of malachi 4 revelation 10 7
[1:50:02] is going to do two things one according
[1:50:04] to malachi 4 he'll turn the hearts of
[1:50:06] the children to the fathers 2
[1:50:08] he will reveal the mysteries of the
[1:50:10] seven thunders
[1:50:13] contained in
[1:50:14] earth seven thunders in revelations 10
[1:50:17] which are the revelations contained in
[1:50:21] the seven seals
[1:50:28] it will be these divinely revealed
[1:50:31] truths
[1:50:32] that literally turn the hearts of the
[1:50:34] children
[1:50:37] to the true
[1:50:39] faith
[1:50:40] pentecostal fathers not the
[1:50:42] denominational father
[1:50:46] and if you think all pentecost is
[1:50:48] shouting and dancing and speaking in
[1:50:50] tongues and prophesy i got news for you
[1:50:52] it's not it's the revealing of the word
[1:50:56] you just search what happened on the day
[1:50:57] of pentecost it was the word that was
[1:50:59] revealed to them the word was vindicated
[1:51:02] and by that word being vindicated by the
[1:51:04] holy spirit revealed to them they really
[1:51:06] heat it up it came by revelation
[1:51:12] that ought to give an answer to somebody
[1:51:16] but
[1:51:17] pentecost shuck
[1:51:19] has perverted that
[1:51:21] if you want to see the pentecostal shuck
[1:51:24] shouting and charisma and everything
[1:51:26] else you're down the wrong line
[1:51:28] you're looking at the wrong thing
[1:51:30] that's not the original pentecost
[1:51:36] because brother branham said the true
[1:51:37] worship involves oil
[1:51:39] and wine
[1:51:42] it's stimulation by revelation given by
[1:51:45] the holy spirit
[1:51:48] amen
[1:51:50] all right
[1:51:52] now
[1:51:55] god's threefold purpose
[1:52:00] i'm going gonna read some things here
[1:52:02] now just carefully listen
[1:52:05] he's speaking on the seventh seal i had
[1:52:07] the revelation it was revealed to me
[1:52:10] he said you all know that i know what
[1:52:12] that seventh seal means
[1:52:14] but he said i've got to stop at the
[1:52:15] moment i can't go any further why did he
[1:52:18] have to because it's denoting to you
[1:52:20] that this is the mystery
[1:52:24] it can't be known to the public
[1:52:26] all right he said but it's revealed it's
[1:52:29] it is it's in a three-fold mystery
[1:52:35] amen amen brother abraham said that
[1:52:38] seventh seal he said it's unveiled in a
[1:52:40] three-fold mystery
[1:52:42] god it's in fact brother sister the
[1:52:45] seventh seal been right back there in
[1:52:46] genesis i just read about it right
[1:52:51] it's happened all the way through the
[1:52:52] bible
[1:52:55] god is gradually he's kept it hid it
[1:52:58] wasn't time to lift it off
[1:53:01] this
[1:53:03] wasn't time to lift it off his statuary
[1:53:05] it wasn't time to unveil this other
[1:53:08] masterpiece
[1:53:10] it wasn't even time then to unveil the
[1:53:12] original masterpiece but he did he spoke
[1:53:15] of it you see it was hid
[1:53:17] but now since the seals are open we can
[1:53:19] see it unveiled right there in genesis
[1:53:24] all right because brother brown said it
[1:53:26] goes all the way through it just passes
[1:53:28] right through the scriptures
[1:53:31] it came right up through the wheat plant
[1:53:32] too
[1:53:35] do you see what i'm trying to say
[1:53:37] part of that wheat plant dies part of
[1:53:39] it's burned part of it's saved at the
[1:53:41] white throne judgment but there's a part
[1:53:43] that goes in the bride
[1:53:45] original grain
[1:53:46] don't you see where we're at life is in
[1:53:48] the grain again it's seed time it's
[1:53:50] bride time
[1:53:52] it's rapture time the head and the body
[1:53:54] are coming together in unity one she's
[1:53:57] laying the presence of the sun and
[1:53:58] ripening
[1:54:00] ripening to what himself
[1:54:05] mrs adam was the mystery of mr adam
[1:54:11] that's all there is to it
[1:54:13] amen all right now now listen to what he
[1:54:16] said
[1:54:17] he said now why
[1:54:19] he said now none of us know
[1:54:21] but i'm going to tell you my revelation
[1:54:24] of it no nobody knows but i'm going to
[1:54:26] tell you my revelation
[1:54:30] john got it
[1:54:31] and the prophet had to get it
[1:54:33] in order to give it to us
[1:54:38] amen
[1:54:39] now watch what he continues to say now
[1:54:41] why let's prove it why is this secret
[1:54:44] why is the secret that no one knows
[1:54:47] about
[1:54:49] john was forbidden to write it
[1:54:51] even write a symbol about it why this is
[1:54:54] why there was no activity in heaven
[1:54:56] remember it was sealed in heaven no
[1:54:58] activity
[1:55:00] okay he said it might give away the
[1:55:02] secret but remember that activity was
[1:55:04] only for a time
[1:55:07] no activity i mean the silence was only
[1:55:09] for a time
[1:55:12] all right but it opened something
[1:55:14] brother brown said oh it's open people
[1:55:16] say no it's closed it's closed no
[1:55:17] brother brown said it's unopened the
[1:55:19] lamb opened it
[1:55:23] opened what the mystery of the seven
[1:55:25] thunders
[1:55:26] the revelation contained in there that
[1:55:28] john couldn't write
[1:55:32] all right now he said even write a
[1:55:35] symbol about it why no activity now it
[1:55:37] now do you see it now he said it might
[1:55:39] give away the secret it's so great it
[1:55:41] must be included it's got to happen
[1:55:46] what is it
[1:55:47] i love the way the prophet brings this
[1:55:49] what is it
[1:55:51] it's the thing that jesus said even the
[1:55:53] angels of heaven didn't know nothing
[1:55:55] about it
[1:55:58] he said even i don't know anything about
[1:56:00] it it goes on to say he didn't know it
[1:56:03] himself
[1:56:08] that made you swallow pretty hard
[1:56:10] he didn't know it himself
[1:56:13] when he was here on earth god the son he
[1:56:15] didn't know it himself even jesus said
[1:56:17] there's things that i couldn't finish
[1:56:18] but i will finish later
[1:56:21] and i'll work in and through the bride
[1:56:22] to complete what i couldn't complete
[1:56:24] when i was in my earthly journey but i
[1:56:26] will now complete it in the bride
[1:56:30] amen i'll work in and through my bride
[1:56:32] all right he said he didn't know it
[1:56:34] himself god only would know it that's
[1:56:36] what he said god only knows it and he
[1:56:38] told us when you begin to see these
[1:56:40] signs coming up now you're getting
[1:56:42] somewhere
[1:56:43] all right
[1:56:44] notice we can see those signs coming up
[1:56:48] he said he said there's
[1:56:51] satan satan he said doesn't know
[1:56:53] anything about it it's the third pull he
[1:56:55] just doesn't know about it it's the
[1:56:58] third pull right
[1:57:04] now
[1:57:07] some of you really need to be eating the
[1:57:09] book
[1:57:11] some of you really don't know the clue
[1:57:13] what i'm talking about
[1:57:15] because you need to be feeding on the
[1:57:17] book and not your so-called pleasures
[1:57:24] amen
[1:57:26] i'm sorry i'm not trying to be judging
[1:57:27] anybody and i'm not
[1:57:29] but that's what the bible said every
[1:57:31] every
[1:57:32] well i won't go there
[1:57:37] i've said that so god said that so it
[1:57:40] would shake you to get to reading
[1:57:43] get the searching
[1:57:49] you're missing something and this
[1:57:50] devil's taking up your time and getting
[1:57:52] you so tore up and so upset over little
[1:57:56] pity any things
[1:57:58] to keep you away from this
[1:58:01] he hates the manifestation of the word
[1:58:03] but it so happens that's the bride's
[1:58:05] position is the manifested word because
[1:58:08] he's the word she is the word
[1:58:12] and today it's himself in the formation
[1:58:15] of the bride that's your message
[1:58:22] same one same power same jesus he said
[1:58:26] right here today same one same power
[1:58:28] same jesus in the bride form and he said
[1:58:31] it is the bride coming of christ
[1:58:41] god had a purpose now you say well see
[1:58:43] he didn't go he didn't even know about
[1:58:45] it
[1:58:46] he said it's the thing say she said the
[1:58:48] things god didn't know about and he
[1:58:51] brother brown said i saw that seventh
[1:58:52] seal open and it was the thing that
[1:58:54] jesus did said he didn't know about
[1:58:58] and then he said i saw it go to those
[1:59:00] seven thunders and john was forbidden to
[1:59:01] write it so the two are the same
[1:59:04] what he didn't know about
[1:59:06] was what was hidden
[1:59:10] amen but i've got news for you he began
[1:59:13] he did know about it because when he
[1:59:16] sent it down and put that sword in the
[1:59:18] hand of his prophet
[1:59:19] he knew about it
[1:59:22] amen
[1:59:23] listen this just let me get that right
[1:59:25] here on the message revelation
[1:59:28] the revelation of jesus christ 1960 1204
[1:59:32] he said but after his death he said
[1:59:34] jesus said it's not for you to know the
[1:59:36] hour or the time
[1:59:38] no one would know even the son as yet
[1:59:40] did not know as yet did not know
[1:59:43] he said but after his death burial and
[1:59:45] resurrection and ascension into glory he
[1:59:48] received from god the future of the
[1:59:50] church
[1:59:52] and he said then he returned back to
[1:59:55] bring this message to the church this
[1:59:57] message and this message and this
[2:00:00] message of his coming
[2:00:07] and and he said he would give the
[2:00:09] condition of the churches down through
[2:00:11] the age he could not do it before his
[2:00:13] death burial and resurrection because he
[2:00:15] had not known it yet himself
[2:00:19] amen
[2:00:23] but did you notice how the scripture
[2:00:25] reads there the revelation revelation 1
[2:00:27] 1 the revelation of jesus christ which
[2:00:30] god gave unto him
[2:00:32] where did god give it to john no he gave
[2:00:35] it to jesus christ
[2:00:37] what did he give to him a complete full
[2:00:40] revelation of deity
[2:00:44] and without his bride he is not complete
[2:00:52] adam without eve was not complete
[2:00:56] it had to be he had him in himself but
[2:00:58] he wasn't completed yet god had a
[2:01:00] further and he and we call it and we
[2:01:03] believe it is this it's the capping off
[2:01:05] or the crowning act in genesis that was
[2:01:09] the crowning act
[2:01:11] of god's work
[2:01:12] was when he brought the woman out of the
[2:01:14] man
[2:01:17] and today it's the crowning act of the
[2:01:20] creation of his word of jesus christ a
[2:01:23] spoken word creation
[2:01:27] because that's what literally the bride
[2:01:28] is as a spoken word seed of god that's
[2:01:31] what he said the bride is
[2:01:34] all right
[2:01:36] oh my
[2:01:39] amen i
[2:01:41] all right threefold purpose brother
[2:01:43] branham i was reading about that let me
[2:01:44] get it back here
[2:01:45] i've got to get to that before we close
[2:01:47] so
[2:01:48] you just bear with me
[2:01:50] now
[2:01:53] this god's great mystery
[2:01:56] god had a purpose and a hidden mystery
[2:01:58] and that's what i want to speak on to
[2:02:00] the church this morning he's preaching a
[2:02:02] message christ the mystery of god
[2:02:03] revealed and he's saying right back from
[2:02:05] what he just said he said but i want to
[2:02:07] speak on it this morning
[2:02:10] what was he wanting to speak on
[2:02:12] the seventh seal
[2:02:14] i want to speak on it this morning and
[2:02:16] it's god's purpose and a hidden mystery
[2:02:18] and that's what i want to speak to the
[2:02:20] church the morning the hidden mystery of
[2:02:21] god that he had in his mind before the
[2:02:24] world ever began and how that it's
[2:02:26] unfolded itself right down to this
[2:02:28] present hour that we're living
[2:02:32] amen
[2:02:34] and he says then you will understand
[2:02:36] clearly you see what i believe what is
[2:02:38] being done
[2:02:40] god's great mystery
[2:02:43] of how it's a secret he kept it a secret
[2:02:46] nobody knows nothing about it even the
[2:02:48] angels didn't understand what did he say
[2:02:50] the mystery of how
[2:02:54] and he didn't reveal it and the reason
[2:02:56] under our seventh seal when the seventh
[2:02:58] seal was open there was silence jesus
[2:03:00] said when he was on earth they wanted to
[2:03:02] know when he would come he said not even
[2:03:04] the son himself don't know when it's
[2:03:05] going to happen god has all of this to
[2:03:08] himself
[2:03:12] so what is this he's going to unfold a
[2:03:14] three-fold because this revelation is
[2:03:16] unfolded in a three-fold manner or myst
[2:03:19] or purpose
[2:03:22] and he gradually began to unfold that
[2:03:24] threefold purpose all the way through
[2:03:25] the scriptures
[2:03:27] and when you see it is so simple you
[2:03:29] wonder how you missed it because it took
[2:03:31] a bride to uncover it i mean excuse me a
[2:03:34] messenger by the holy spirit to unc took
[2:03:36] god to uncover that
[2:03:39] and let you see it god's work all the
[2:03:41] way through
[2:03:43] and he had for one purpose he was doing
[2:03:45] that to take to him a bride
[2:03:47] to himself he would bring her to himself
[2:03:51] and he will carry you on eagle's wings
[2:03:53] and bring you to himself
[2:03:56] amen all right
[2:03:58] then that's the reason there was silence
[2:04:00] in heaven for a space of a half hour
[2:04:02] it's a secret even this and it's still a
[2:04:05] secret
[2:04:06] because brother branham said it cannot
[2:04:08] be known to the public and we all know
[2:04:09] the public can't know this the only way
[2:04:12] the public can know it is after the
[2:04:13] bride leaves because he who letteth will
[2:04:16] let until he the bride christ the bride
[2:04:19] is taken out
[2:04:22] then he unveils himself to the world the
[2:04:23] bride's done gone
[2:04:29] this that we're talking about is an
[2:04:31] unveiled mystery
[2:04:34] a finished mystery of god
[2:04:37] that he said i'll withhold it but i'll
[2:04:38] let it know and i'll bring my bride to
[2:04:40] her position and her place and she'll
[2:04:42] recognize what she is who she is how
[2:04:45] that she was in me at the beginning how
[2:04:47] i that's why the seals were open i got
[2:04:48] the quote right here
[2:04:52] he said you want to know
[2:04:55] if you want to know why
[2:04:57] how
[2:04:58] she would be
[2:05:02] he said those seven seals being open
[2:05:05] paragraph 12 rising of the sun he said
[2:05:08] those seals were opened by god's gods
[2:05:10] himself revealed these mysteries
[2:05:13] not by man but god himself that opened
[2:05:15] those seven mysteries of what the church
[2:05:18] was
[2:05:22] how it was in christ at the beginning
[2:05:26] and how it would be revealed in the last
[2:05:28] day
[2:05:29] you say brother david why are you so why
[2:05:31] are you preaching such a deep because
[2:05:33] i've got to get you to reach for
[2:05:34] something
[2:05:36] the ministry should be getting the
[2:05:37] people to try to press to reach for
[2:05:39] something more
[2:05:42] i'm what am i doing then if i'm doing
[2:05:43] anything else i am planting
[2:05:46] seed amen
[2:05:49] it's not in vain
[2:05:51] the message we got to preach the message
[2:05:58] well i just don't need that then well
[2:05:59] maybe you don't need to go home then to
[2:06:01] a rapture
[2:06:02] because this will be the thing that's
[2:06:04] going to literally change your body
[2:06:10] amen i mean that with all my heart and
[2:06:12] i'd say you better get desperate
[2:06:14] when you realize that it was once
[2:06:16] embodied in the body of jesus christ and
[2:06:18] now what was embodied in him is now
[2:06:20] embodied in the bride the prophet said
[2:06:22] it ought to bring a desperation to you
[2:06:28] you say well the people don't have any
[2:06:29] desperation they just like the days ago
[2:06:31] they're coming under a lady seeing
[2:06:32] spirit we just go to church no there's a
[2:06:35] bride that's in a revival and is red-hot
[2:06:38] she'll have nothing to do with that
[2:06:39] compromising laodicean spirit
[2:06:42] young or old the word is before you go
[2:06:45] eat the book
[2:06:47] pray for god praise and god reveal this
[2:06:49] to me
[2:06:52] to me

[2:06:54] you do to son or daughter reveal it to
[2:06:56] me it's me that's standing before you
[2:06:59] i've got to have you

[2:07:04] would set this little bride in a rapture
[2:07:06] and a meeting in the air and it's got to
[2:07:08] be here and we are being gathered
[2:07:10] together by the coming of the lord
[2:07:14] brother brown said that seventh seal was
[2:07:16] that mystery of his coming
[2:07:21] amen all right now
[2:07:23] see
[2:07:25] so you see
[2:07:26] it says how she was in christ already in
[2:07:29] god how was she in god in the thinking
[2:07:31] of himself in eternity already
[2:07:36] revealed we didn't know that brother
[2:07:38] branham took the message and opened up
[2:07:40] what god had in his mind and where you
[2:07:42] were there
[2:07:46] then he said and i'll reveal it to how
[2:07:48] they were in the sun
[2:07:50] then i'll make it known how they're to
[2:07:52] be here in the end time three-fold
[2:07:55] manner
[2:07:58] all right so purpose the purpose of god
[2:08:02] now save time
[2:08:05] he showed it and revealed it in every
[2:08:07] type of the bible the entire bible is
[2:08:09] expression of one goal had had god had
[2:08:12] one purpose he wanted to achieve in the
[2:08:13] entire bible and all the acts of the
[2:08:16] believers in bible have been expressing
[2:08:17] what god's great goal is and how it's
[2:08:20] revealed in the last day he shows it and
[2:08:22] how god's help will see it right here
[2:08:24] this morning
[2:08:28] why don't you run into that message and
[2:08:30] find out what he said
[2:08:34] amen it's laying there why are you
[2:08:36] letting the devil talk you out of doing
[2:08:38] it

[2:08:47] amen
[2:08:49] it's your life
[2:08:50] you know once you get that life you
[2:08:51] don't want to see that manifested

[2:09:13] personally and you see your name written

[2:10:09] brother branham called it the back part
[2:10:10] of his mind what the lord has had in his
[2:10:13] mind all along and has expressed it
[2:10:16] and now god has had a threefold purpose
[2:10:18] in this great mystery secret god is a
[2:10:21] great mystery secret he had it before

[2:15:46] notice god has had a threefold purpose
[2:15:49] in this great mystery secret god in his
[2:15:52] great mystery secret that he had before
[2:15:54] the world began he has got a threefold
[2:15:57] purpose in it
[2:15:59] now we now what we want to go upon this
[2:16:03] morning is what that threefold purpose
[2:16:05] is
[2:16:06] because this seventh seal
[2:16:09] is contained in that threefold purpose
[2:16:13] amen it's right there
[2:16:15] threefold mystery
[2:16:17] okay the first thing
[2:16:19] first thing he said
[2:16:21] of this purpose was that god wanted to
[2:16:24] reveal himself to the people
[2:16:27] that was his what that he said
[2:16:31] that was his and one of his great
[2:16:34] threefold purposes was to express
[2:16:37] himself identify himself with human
[2:16:40] beings to reveal himself
[2:16:44] in christ
[2:16:49] what was the title of this message
[2:16:52] christ is what
[2:16:54] the mystery of god
[2:16:57] revealed
[2:17:00] amen
[2:17:03] so he wanted to express himself as a
[2:17:05] human being
[2:17:06] to reveal himself in christ other words
[2:17:10] to express
[2:17:12] manifest the mystery of himself in a man
[2:17:19] all right
[2:17:20] all right he's talking about the second
[2:17:22] adam now watch what he says here
[2:17:24] secondly
[2:17:25] secondly because he's wanting to express
[2:17:27] himself in christ so all that god was
[2:17:30] all a double l all that god was
[2:17:34] he did what poured himself into
[2:17:37] christ
[2:17:38] jesus christ
[2:17:41] all and became the full
[2:17:44] godhead bodily
[2:17:46] the fullness of himself in one man
[2:17:49] our savior our redeemer redeemer deity
[2:17:53] himself in flesh
[2:17:57] god come down to identify himself with
[2:18:00] man
[2:18:01] as a as a gowell as a kinsmen redeemer
[2:18:05] all right
[2:18:06] now
[2:18:08] secondly that was his first
[2:18:11] plan that was i mean of his threefold
[2:18:13] purpose
[2:18:15] secondly to have the preeminence to for
[2:18:18] that purpose he did that to and see
[2:18:22] to have the preeminence
[2:18:30] to have the preeminence in his body of
[2:18:33] believers that's his second fold
[2:18:36] the purpose of his first time coming the
[2:18:38] first coming
[2:18:40] was to have
[2:18:41] the and and to do this to do what so he
[2:18:44] could have preeminence in the body of
[2:18:46] his believers that is his bride that he
[2:18:49] might live in people another place he
[2:18:52] said he did that for the purpose of
[2:18:54] sanctifying his bride that he could come
[2:18:58] and live in her
[2:19:03] okay so now secondly you have the second
[2:19:06] full purpose
[2:19:08] the second fold was to come in the body
[2:19:10] of believers
[2:19:13] that redemption the paying of the price
[2:19:14] the pouring out of the holy spirit would
[2:19:16] come back into the body of the believers
[2:19:20] they would be could receive a new birth
[2:19:23] amen by the baptism of his own life in
[2:19:26] them meeting that seed in their soul
[2:19:29] right now
[2:19:32] that he might live in people
[2:19:34] again
[2:19:35] paragraph 145
[2:19:38] of the same book christ the mystery now
[2:19:40] now he could do that in adam and eve
[2:19:44] oh now you see why we read the genesis
[2:19:47] he did that very thing see he showed it
[2:19:49] right there in adam and eve where was
[2:19:52] eve
[2:19:53] in adam where did god pour himself into
[2:19:56] adam let us make man in our image
[2:20:00] where was the woman in the man
[2:20:05] that right
[2:20:07] what was the second fold
[2:20:10] when the woman
[2:20:11] was brought out of the man
[2:20:14] amen
[2:20:16] it was adam
[2:20:19] in the feminine form of his wife
[2:20:23] she was his mystery
[2:20:25] revealed
[2:20:27] what he came for
[2:20:30] god
[2:20:32] pulled it out of him
[2:20:34] he died for that purpose
[2:20:37] that he brother braham said what was the
[2:20:38] crucifixion of christ for it was for a
[2:20:40] purpose that he might take one to be his
[2:20:42] bride
[2:20:44] amen a masterpiece
[2:20:48] other words the peace smitten off of him
[2:20:50] he took and created his wife
[2:20:54] amen made his wife created she's a
[2:20:56] spoken word creation took the peace off
[2:20:58] of the second atom made and formed the
[2:21:00] bride out of that piece and she said
[2:21:02] she's the very piece of himself and we
[2:21:05] come back together by the revelation of
[2:21:07] this message they come back together you
[2:21:09] don't see super separate people you see
[2:21:11] the same self person

[2:21:28] son of man revealing himself
[2:21:30] through a son of man to unite the two
[2:21:32] together
[2:21:35] amen amen he brought her to himself
[2:21:39] all right
[2:21:41] then
[2:21:42] he could do that in adam and eve but sin
[2:21:44] separated them so now there had to be
[2:21:46] some way to get it back again
[2:21:48] you see god in order to express himself
[2:21:50] in his attributes he knew that would
[2:21:53] happen but is he going to lose it no
[2:21:55] he's going to restore it right back

[2:23:30] don't put up with that nonsense we don't
[2:23:32] put up with that thing
[2:23:34] we don't put up with it in this church
[2:23:37] when it wants to raise its head up and
[2:23:38] spread among the people like a cancer we
[2:23:41] do it we just call it out that's all
[2:23:42] there is to it by the word
[2:23:47] it's wrong
[2:23:49] see
[2:23:50] and the holy spirit discerns it
[2:23:52] it's off the word why would it be wrong

[2:23:57] provided way

[2:24:18] trying to prophesy through a dominating
[2:24:20] female spirit today
[2:24:24] but he won't let that thing dominate it
[2:24:25] will not have nomination over me nor
[2:24:28] will it have it over the bride
[2:24:31] and when god unveils it you ought to
[2:24:32] take up notice and you ought to repent
[2:24:34] and get right

[2:32:36] there is the threefold purpose oh he
[2:32:38] said he said though he said right back
[2:32:40] to eden again as hard as it can go

[2:35:49] looked and behold a door was opened in
[2:35:51] heaven praise be to god a door was

[2:35:56] and the first voice which i heard as
[2:35:58] there were a trumpet talking with me
[2:35:59] said come up higher and i will show thee
[2:36:01] things which must be hereafter and

[2:36:19] my sheep hear my voice
[2:36:21] the stranger they'll not follow
[2:36:23] and he is the door and the door was set
[2:36:26] open
[2:36:27] you say brother david
[2:36:29] brother branham said this this ministry
[2:36:31] right here
[2:36:33] was found right here in revelations
[2:36:35] chapter 4
[2:36:36] amen
[2:36:38] and here we are
[2:36:43] and here's what happened
[2:36:45] brother branham on the fourth seal said
[2:36:47] out of the millions in the world in the
[2:36:49] days of elijah when jezebel and ahab
[2:36:50] were reigning in the type of the
[2:36:52] antitype today
[2:36:54] out of the whole world there was only
[2:36:55] 700 now we know
[2:36:57] he said 700 the bible said 7 thousand
[2:37:00] saved of elijah's preaching elijah never
[2:37:03] knew one of them was that way he didn't
[2:37:05] know they were that way he thought he
[2:37:06] was the only one saved until god opened
[2:37:09] one of the seals
[2:37:13] one of the seals
[2:37:16] and showed him the mystery
[2:37:18] of the book
[2:37:22] amen what are we speaking of this
[2:37:24] morning the mystery of the book
[2:37:27] showed him the mystery of the book
[2:37:31] that he had 700
[2:37:34] that or 7 707 that doesn't matter
[2:37:37] that never bowed them down to them
[2:37:39] creeds they had when god opened his book
[2:37:42] to elijah he said now wait a minute son
[2:37:45] i've got 700 that's tucked around out
[2:37:47] there got their names on the book since
[2:37:49] the foundation of the world they're mine
[2:37:54] did you catch that
[2:37:56] okay god opened the seals that's the
[2:37:58] reason i think john was doing all that
[2:38:00] shouting the other night he must have
[2:38:02] seen his name on there you see
[2:38:07] that was revelation chapter five when he
[2:38:09] had taken the book
[2:38:11] he said talk about a happy time when
[2:38:12] them seals broke
[2:38:14] talk about a happy time when them seals
[2:38:16] broke today talk about a happy time
[2:38:19] we're having i can't get enough of it
[2:38:22] talk about a happy time there when
[2:38:24] they're sealed broke john must have
[2:38:26] looked in and seen a past the curtain of
[2:38:28] time
[2:38:31] and said there's john
[2:38:33] i wonder if you look to pass the curtain
[2:38:35] of time and see the mystery of yourself
[2:38:38] revealed or if you can say
[2:38:41] there's
[2:38:45] you fill it in
[2:38:49] but there's the real you on the inside
[2:38:51] the spirit of god there he is there's
[2:38:54] the open word that's what he sent it for
[2:38:57] that's why he said the ministry of the
[2:38:59] seventh angels the third poll that's why
[2:39:01] he said the ministry of the of
[2:39:03] revelation 10 is the third pull because
[2:39:05] it opened in us it's the opening of the
[2:39:08] word
[2:39:09] personally he opened up the book
[2:39:15] and you've looked past the curtain of
[2:39:16] time
[2:39:18] amen praise be to god
[2:39:21] amen
[2:39:23] amen we're doing real good now i'm
[2:39:25] closing
[2:39:29] i didn't even hear an amen
[2:39:31] that's good
[2:39:33] i'll continue on
[2:39:36] okay
[2:39:37] no i'm closing
[2:39:41] of course we know the mystery is only
[2:39:42] revealed to her
[2:39:45] the bride book
[2:39:47] notice
[2:39:48] now then you are a son of god
[2:39:53] in the house of god
[2:39:55] you are part of god's economy
[2:39:58] then there is no condemnation to them
[2:40:00] which are in christ jesus
[2:40:02] no judgment
[2:40:04] now we do stand before a throne i will
[2:40:07] tell you
[2:40:08] but it's not the white throne
[2:40:11] we stand before a throne to give an
[2:40:12] account
[2:40:14] of our life here to him for
[2:40:17] reward
[2:40:19] not for judgment
[2:40:20] it's a judgment for rewards
[2:40:26] i don't have time to go into that
[2:40:27] explain it but it's all through the
[2:40:29] bible paul said we must all stand before
[2:40:31] the throne of god
[2:40:34] and he's talking about the reward
[2:40:37] you're not losing your salvation there
[2:40:38] because you're already raptured you've
[2:40:40] already you've already raptured you're
[2:40:42] in the bride but it's for reward i say
[2:40:45] god help me
[2:40:47] to live such a life
[2:40:49] of christ
[2:40:51] that you could say it's enough reward
[2:40:53] for me it was well done
[2:40:56] my good and faithful servant
[2:40:58] enter into the joys of the lord see
[2:41:01] amen there's a roll call that's a roll
[2:41:03] call there

[2:41:08] we expect to be there i expect to meet
[2:41:11] every one of you there i want to meet
[2:41:13] every one of you there
[2:41:14] amen
[2:41:16] amen but this is such an individual
[2:41:18] affair
[2:41:19] to be manifested in a group
[2:41:22] that we've got to make our calling and
[2:41:24] election sure
[2:41:27] listen this isn't just something hatched
[2:41:29] out to a 70 year old man
[2:41:32] i had this pull in me when i was 12
[2:41:34] years old
[2:41:38] i wanted more of god and i knew where to
[2:41:40] look because god revealed it to me i've
[2:41:42] sent my word to a prophet
[2:41:46] that's been in me since that long how
[2:41:49] many years that is you added up
[2:41:53] amen but i love him more than i ever
[2:41:55] loved him
[2:41:56] i could never turn away from this
[2:41:59] because of that word in me can never
[2:42:01] turn
[2:42:03] amen
[2:42:04] okay i'm closing really i am
[2:42:07] okay
[2:42:09] there is now no condemnation
[2:42:13] in christ those are in christ
[2:42:16] for they are dead to the world
[2:42:18] alive in him
[2:42:20] see i want you to know something those
[2:42:22] that there's
[2:42:23] romans romans 8 1 said there is now
[2:42:25] therefore now therefore no condemnation
[2:42:28] to them that are in christ jesus are you
[2:42:30] in christ jesus
[2:42:31] then your headship is not the flesh
[2:42:35] because you're not going to walk by this
[2:42:37] flesh
[2:42:39] all the flesh may war against you but
[2:42:41] you're not putting confidence in your
[2:42:43] mental understanding of what this flesh
[2:42:45] can receive
[2:42:49] amen
[2:42:50] because because those that are in christ
[2:42:52] jesus walk not after the flesh but after
[2:42:54] the spirit
[2:42:57] there's the difference
[2:43:00] amen all right now
[2:43:03] now for you are dead
[2:43:05] and alive in him living is living in
[2:43:07] this present day making the word of god

[2:43:23] little book and when the waters come
[2:43:25] upon that seed that's in the heart it
[2:43:28] raises it up to the bride of christ
[2:43:31] oh my when the waters come upon that
[2:43:33] seed that's in the heart it raises it up
