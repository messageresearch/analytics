[23:53] all that we can give back amen
[23:55] hallelujah good to be here tonight
[23:57] good to see each one of you amen
[24:00] praise the lord i want to speak to you
[24:03] tonight once again
[24:04] from the book of proverbs the 22nd
[24:06] chapter
[24:08] and i want to title this tonight
[24:10] lifelong
[24:11] training we will certainly take this
[24:14] scripture as you'll see here in a minute
[24:17] and it will be one that we fundamentally
[24:20] have
[24:21] known uh and uh but we're going to apply
[24:24] it in a a bigger
[24:26] uh um in a bigger way
[24:29] as we'll see just touching just a moment
[24:33] on
[24:33] the things that the prophet of god
[24:35] brings from these scriptures
[24:37] and lays out uh for us so let's just
[24:40] stand and go
[24:40] proverbs the 22nd chapter we'll read
[24:44] verses one through
[24:45] seven and then we'll move on in our
[24:49] thought tonight
[24:50] once again i say god bless you and happy
[24:52] to see each one of you
[24:54] those of you who might be online that
[24:56] couldn't make it tonight we just pray
[24:58] god would
[24:59] deal kindly with your hearts and meet
[25:01] you
[25:02] or whatever your need might be you know
[25:04] that's
[25:06] my brother and sister just to sidetrack
[25:07] for just a moment
[25:09] over and over and over the prophet of
[25:11] god
[25:13] reminds us speaks to us
[25:16] that god will meet our need
[25:21] so whatever our need is we need to have
[25:23] confidence
[25:24] that god will meet that need not not
[25:26] have a doubt
[25:27] not be in fear not questioning but just
[25:31] know with the confidence that god will
[25:33] meet our need and
[25:35] you know he says that you uh have not
[25:38] because you ask not and when you finally
[25:41] this is kind of my way i
[25:43] read that scripture when we finally get
[25:45] around to asking
[25:46] we don't even ask correctly by then we
[25:49] have like a selfish
[25:51] outlook we have a selfish motive where
[25:54] we're
[25:54] uh coming as beggars you might say
[25:57] instead of sons and daughters of god
[25:59] whatever it might be so tonight just
[26:02] remember
[26:03] that god has promised and as we'll close
[26:05] the service out today i trust the quote
[26:07] we'll read to you
[26:08] will be encouraging to your souls amen
[26:12] a good name is rather to be chosen than
[26:14] great riches
[26:15] and loving favor rather than silver and
[26:18] gold
[26:19] the rich and poor meet together the lord
[26:22] is the maker
[26:22] of them all a prudent man foreseeth the
[26:26] evil and
[26:26] hideth himself but the simple pass on
[26:29] and are punished by humility and the
[26:32] fear of the lord are riches
[26:34] honor and life thorns and snares are in
[26:38] the way of the froward
[26:40] he that doth keep his soul shall be far
[26:42] from them
[26:44] train up a child in the way he should go
[26:47] and when he is old he will not depart
[26:50] from it
[26:51] the rich ruleth over the poor
[26:54] and the borrower is servant to the
[26:58] lender
[26:58] heavenly father we just ask you this
[27:00] evening lord as we just speak these
[27:02] simple words and thoughts father
[27:04] lord just ask you to bless them take
[27:06] them to the hearts of your children
[27:08] father we ask this in the name of jesus
[27:10] christ amen
[27:12] amen you may be seated
[27:15] we want to just go down through these
[27:18] actually six verses tonight uh the
[27:21] seventh um
[27:22] a little ahead of myself in my notes but
[27:25] the seventh
[27:25] i i trust lord willing uh to
[27:29] uh uh maybe have this next week
[27:32] to speak on that because certainly we
[27:35] know
[27:36] that the rich rule over the poor and the
[27:38] borrower is servant to the lender
[27:41] and so that will be maybe a topic lord
[27:44] willing
[27:44] have you ever noticed that the older you
[27:46] get
[27:48] the more the lord willing becomes a part
[27:51] of your words
[27:52] when we're young not arrogant not
[27:54] meaning to be outside of the prophet's
[27:56] words but when we're young we're just
[27:58] we're going to do this
[27:59] but as you get older maybe you pick up a
[28:03] newspaper or you get a text an email
[28:06] a phone call and people your age
[28:09] have went beyond the curtain and you
[28:12] start to realize you know what
[28:14] god's in in control god said but we
[28:18] start to realize
[28:19] the element of our mortality and you
[28:22] know
[28:22] it it's then that it's much simpler it
[28:25] seems to
[28:25] put that into our conversation as the
[28:27] word says as the lord wills you know
[28:30] if we're going to be here next wednesday
[28:32] lord willing we'll
[28:33] preach on the borrower and the lender
[28:36] amen
[28:37] now we look at this my brother and
[28:39] sister and i just want to go through
[28:41] these verses here for a few minutes
[28:43] a good name is rather to be chosen than
[28:45] great riches and loving favor
[28:47] rather than silver and gold and you know
[28:50] it's just really hard to place a value
[28:53] on a good name
[28:54] you look at this world that we live in
[28:56] today and as we were
[28:58] speaking to the young people they're
[28:59] going to go to camp we just ask them to
[29:02] to you know remember that they will
[29:05] put that reputation or identity to their
[29:09] name by their behaviors and
[29:11] and uh you know i say that just because
[29:13] i feel like it's my job to say that to
[29:15] our young people we have a good group of
[29:17] young people i have confidence in them
[29:20] but you know we have to recognize that a
[29:22] a bad reputation
[29:24] is hard to live down one's life can
[29:26] change
[29:27] one's circumstance can change but
[29:30] certain things would then follow that
[29:32] person and
[29:33] so it's just really you know as the
[29:35] scripture says a good name is rather to
[29:37] be chosen than great riches and
[29:39] you know it'd be really hard to place a
[29:41] value on a good name
[29:42] but we know right here according to the
[29:44] scripture that great riches is
[29:46] lower than a good name and so lord help
[29:49] us not to worry about the riches but to
[29:52] have a good name and as we were looking
[29:54] this last sunday sharing in the
[29:56] scripture
[29:57] you know our whole goal our desire is to
[30:00] please the lord and
[30:01] we come short but god has provided a way
[30:04] for us and
[30:05] so we recognize my brother and sister
[30:08] that
[30:08] loving favor now you know i have in my
[30:11] own natural life
[30:13] can look back and you know often times
[30:15] you hear people say well you know the
[30:17] prophet of god
[30:18] kind of showed us scripture declares
[30:20] that you know someone who does something
[30:22] good to you a
[30:23] a glass of cold water uh you know that
[30:26] that that could grant them eternal life
[30:28] and i have heard that and seen that used
[30:31] in
[30:31] in just uh many many examples that i
[30:34] i'll be honest with you'll be truthful
[30:37] i felt like they had taken it out of
[30:39] context you know
[30:40] uh and i know folks and i'm not judging
[30:43] them but i just want to make example to
[30:44] you
[30:45] that have that down to almost if someone
[30:48] holds the door for you
[30:49] hey they're going to have eternal life
[30:51] they did something good for me
[30:52] now my brother and sister will
[30:54] understand that there's going to be
[30:55] circumstances
[30:56] that we cannot judge it's beyond our
[30:59] comprehension
[31:01] of what god means when he's talking
[31:03] about those that have been good to the
[31:05] bride of christ
[31:06] we we can't go out and start judging
[31:08] that by
[31:09] by these little things in our life i
[31:12] have a good friend
[31:13] and i say good friend because i base
[31:15] that on relationship in the past we
[31:17] don't
[31:18] rub shoulders too much anymore but there
[31:20] was a time in my life he did tremendous
[31:23] favors for me and we're talking about in
[31:25] the financial realm
[31:27] uh he gave me opportunities to get into
[31:29] the trucking business and
[31:30] and there was a season in our life that
[31:33] that made a tremendous financial
[31:35] difference and he never charged me i i
[31:38] run
[31:38] if you understand that business i ran
[31:40] under his authority for several years
[31:43] before he helped me or encouraged me to
[31:46] to uh file for our own and and it made a
[31:49] great difference
[31:50] uh this man my brother and sister i
[31:52] don't know how god will judge him
[31:54] but this man is a man who loves to drink
[31:57] and he loves to party and he loves his
[31:59] jokes and he loves his movies and
[32:02] whatever it is
[32:03] and and i will not judge him i i
[32:05] actually am very fond of this man
[32:07] but you know it'd be easy to say well
[32:09] because of what he did made such a
[32:11] difference in my financial life
[32:13] our world at that time that god is going
[32:15] to grant eternal life to him
[32:17] i don't know but let's not forget the
[32:20] very
[32:20] fundamental foundation of it all is that
[32:23] we have to
[32:24] change amen we have to go from the
[32:28] sinner nature into the nature of a son
[32:31] or daughter of god and as brother david
[32:33] and i was talking this sunday the only
[32:34] way you're going to do that is be born
[32:36] again
[32:37] you know there's no shortcut there's no
[32:40] golden whatever
[32:41] there's no lottery to win my brother and
[32:43] sister so
[32:44] we don't know what god's favor will be
[32:47] to these people who are good to the
[32:49] bride of jesus christ
[32:50] so let's not go where we don't know the
[32:53] answer let's not go
[32:54] out and create our own narrative of what
[32:57] it will mean
[32:58] but my brother and sister there will be
[33:00] those that will do
[33:02] things that grant them favor in god's
[33:05] eyes and he gives to them
[33:07] eternal life but you see we were
[33:09] something placed in our hearts in our
[33:11] soul
[33:12] uh that uh you might say even in our
[33:14] mind right because our thinking has to
[33:16] encompass this also my brother and
[33:18] sister we want a more sure word we're
[33:21] not here
[33:21] thinking if we can do a good deed as it
[33:24] were i do a good deed i do a good deed
[33:26] then i could make it in but you see god
[33:28] has placed something in you and i
[33:31] that has opened the door as we were
[33:33] talking about the key on sunday
[33:35] open the door to you and i to the word
[33:38] that we can step
[33:39] into that door which is beyond the veil
[33:42] amen and step into the presence of
[33:44] almighty god
[33:45] and understand the word and the
[33:48] revelation of that word brings life
[33:50] that is already in you brings it out
[33:53] and manifests itself as a rose would
[33:56] grow in the spring
[33:57] that rose my brother and sister is you
[33:59] still got four
[34:00] thorns on it got a lot of thorns in fact
[34:03] you got more thorns than you can imagine
[34:05] but what caps or crowns the thorns
[34:08] the rose hallelujah so we can choose to
[34:12] look
[34:12] at all the thorns in our lives
[34:16] or we can look at the beautiful rose as
[34:18] it were that god has brought forth out
[34:20] of us
[34:21] hallelujah my my brother and sister you
[34:24] never
[34:25] never never never saw a wife
[34:28] or girlfriend as far as that would go
[34:30] that would say oh my goodness you
[34:32] brought me one of those thorny plants
[34:36] no sir they look at roses and say that's
[34:38] beautiful
[34:39] thank you a sign of love a sign of
[34:42] appreciation
[34:43] you see the thorns
[34:46] are removed before they're presented
[34:50] i want you to think about that god's
[34:53] grace and mercy in our life
[34:55] the thorns are removed before we
[34:58] are presented oh thank you lord
[35:02] hallelujah now you know i hate to admit
[35:06] this
[35:06] uh sister jerry used to tell me i was a
[35:08] thief but um
[35:09] i i worked with a man and he lived in
[35:12] the uh
[35:12] town of caldwell and and i would pick
[35:15] him up
[35:16] we were doing construction work i would
[35:17] take him to boise every day
[35:19] and then on my way home i chose a
[35:21] different route because of the time of
[35:23] day
[35:24] to to drop him off at his house and then
[35:26] i would duck down some side streets and
[35:28] i would come down
[35:29] and there's a strange intersection in
[35:32] caldwell
[35:33] that actually has almost like three
[35:35] streets coming and one of them is at a
[35:37] tight angle
[35:38] and i would come up there and stop at
[35:40] the curb and i was doing construction
[35:42] work i had all kinds of sharp tools
[35:44] and in my mind i had it justified right
[35:47] that that i wasn't i wasn't doing
[35:49] anything wrong
[35:50] but these people have this big huge rose
[35:52] bush that span
[35:53] down their fence line right there on the
[35:55] street and the street i come up to the
[35:57] intersection on had very little traffic
[35:59] i would just stop get out of the pickup
[36:01] walk around there snip snip snip snip
[36:05] and then i would take this bouquet home
[36:08] to jerry
[36:09] well it didn't take my lovely life wife
[36:11] very long to figure out these didn't
[36:12] come from a flower shop because he still
[36:15] had thorns attached
[36:16] but you see my brother and sister it was
[36:18] the thought of the heart
[36:20] you know that i want to present that to
[36:22] her unfortunately i was
[36:23] too much of a cheapskate but anyway you
[36:26] look at this and my brother and sister
[36:28] you see
[36:28] how that in this favor that we find
[36:32] in the presence of god now this
[36:35] is something that we would look and i
[36:38] was just sharing you a brief example of
[36:40] man's favor i have been blessed and
[36:42] don't mean to focus it to me tonight
[36:44] but i have been blessed many times in my
[36:47] life
[36:47] of man's favor of people saying this is
[36:50] what we would like to do for you the
[36:52] property where sister jerry and i live
[36:54] now was the you might say the favor of
[36:57] of a lady a landlord that uh you know
[37:01] we have done just simple things through
[37:03] the years been good stewards of her land
[37:05] good stewards of taking care of her
[37:07] making sure you know if her furnace ran
[37:09] out of oil that we would fill it up for
[37:11] her without any cost or
[37:13] these kind of things and she come along
[37:15] and says i want to sell this to you
[37:17] and she sold it to us in a fashion my
[37:20] brother and sister that would be
[37:21] undeniably
[37:23] a favor of man undeniably something that
[37:26] she did that was out of the ordinary
[37:29] and those are wonderful and i i'm
[37:30] thankful she has passed on now
[37:33] and so i'm i'm very thankful for what
[37:35] she's done and
[37:36] we can probably all look in our life and
[37:38] make a you know example to ourself
[37:41] of favor that man has done for us and
[37:44] we'll look at that and say thank you and
[37:47] you know don't know what kind of reward
[37:49] as i was saying that god might grant to
[37:50] them
[37:51] and all of that is well and good but
[37:53] there's nothing like
[37:54] living in god's favor there's nothing
[37:57] like living in the presence of almighty
[37:59] god
[38:00] knowing that the blessings are pouring
[38:02] from heaven
[38:03] and as that song says i i'm drinking
[38:05] from my saucer cause my cup
[38:07] has overflowed there's nothing like that
[38:10] and you might say well we're going
[38:11] through hard times or have gone through
[38:13] hard times uh
[38:15] we're struggling with certain things my
[38:17] brother and sister if you will stop you
[38:19] will recognize
[38:20] in a world where satan hates you more
[38:22] than anything
[38:24] he wants to destroy you more than
[38:26] anything
[38:27] that you are as an overcomer living
[38:30] under god's favor it is there that god
[38:33] is constantly pouring blessings out
[38:35] protecting you
[38:36] i don't know if god will choose to but
[38:38] if so one day we will be there in heaven
[38:40] and as it were maybe that great film of
[38:43] our life would roll
[38:44] and you would look and say i never knew
[38:46] i never knew remember we were preaching
[38:48] the other day
[38:49] that it wasn't whether the angels was
[38:52] there or not
[38:53] is whether they could see them and so
[38:55] it's there that we know my brother and
[38:57] sister that god
[38:58] has got a whole protective hedge around
[39:02] us
[39:02] his favor his angels are here with us
[39:05] and we look at that and realize that we
[39:07] are living in god's tender favor
[39:10] and the tender hand of jehovah now you
[39:13] know when i was younger
[39:14] i struggled with this to understand how
[39:17] as brother branham talked about the
[39:18] holocaust
[39:20] what happened to the jews was the tender
[39:22] hand of jehovah
[39:24] and we would say well how could that be
[39:26] the tender hand of jehovah
[39:28] but god knew what it would take to
[39:30] fulfill
[39:31] his word and to cause them to pull their
[39:34] roots up
[39:35] from wherever they were at and go back
[39:38] to the promised land
[39:39] and so to god that was tinder that he
[39:42] brought them
[39:43] as a people back to their land now my
[39:46] brother and sister we as sons and
[39:47] daughters of god
[39:49] have a promise it is not as it were a
[39:51] land
[39:52] but it is a position in christ and we
[39:55] have been given
[39:56] that and god by his tender mercies the
[39:59] tender hand of jehovah
[40:00] will bring you and i to that position
[40:04] that we belong in amen you say well
[40:06] we're having hard times
[40:08] don't worry god is just moving you
[40:10] coaching
[40:11] schooling you to get you ready for the
[40:14] position
[40:15] he called you for oh hallelujah that's
[40:18] hard sometimes
[40:19] when times are struggled you know it's
[40:21] uh you know i was at work today
[40:23] and you know somebody asked me says well
[40:25] how's your day going
[40:26] and i said which part the bad part or
[40:29] the worst
[40:30] you see some days feel like that my
[40:32] brother and sister maybe it's just the
[40:33] devil
[40:34] wanting to get us a place that we won't
[40:36] step up and claim victory when we come
[40:38] to the house of god
[40:39] maybe he wants to show up on wednesday
[40:41] night and let you walk into the house of
[40:44] god or
[40:44] you might say force you to walk in the
[40:46] house of god and then
[40:48] instead of just being able to move in a
[40:50] position of worship
[40:51] you've got to fight off spirits and
[40:53] you've got to fight off an
[40:54] attitude and and whatever it is so that
[40:56] you can break through
[40:57] into the presence of the word you see my
[41:00] brother and sister oftentimes will view
[41:02] that and say well
[41:03] i'm just not seeming to be very
[41:05] spiritual if god would open your eyes
[41:07] and you would see the host of hell
[41:10] trying to destroy you and open our eyes
[41:13] to see the host of heaven
[41:15] who is guarding and lifting you up oh my
[41:19] it's a warfare my brother and sister
[41:21] this is not a game of go to church or
[41:23] not go to church
[41:24] this is a game my brother if you would
[41:26] put it that way
[41:27] that this is the fight the game the
[41:29] final warfare
[41:31] of the final age my brother and sister
[41:33] and satan says i've only got one last
[41:36] chance to tear up this bride of christ i
[41:39] can
[41:39] only get to her one last time
[41:43] and he's pouring all he's got into it
[41:49] now pardon me for using this as an
[41:51] example but i just happened to be in a
[41:53] store the other day and
[41:54] and there was a a a tv playing there
[41:58] or maybe it was a restaurant i don't
[42:00] remember maybe it was a restaurant
[42:02] oh i know what it was texas roadhouse
[42:04] anyway right there there was a screen
[42:06] and there's a horse race and
[42:07] the horses are running around the track
[42:09] and all of you at some point in time
[42:10] would have seen or understand that
[42:12] and they're just running running running
[42:14] and here's this horse
[42:15] that they were like well he was all
[42:17] favored to win you know he was favored
[42:19] to be
[42:19] this and that and but look at him he's
[42:21] three links back and he's
[42:23] the sister kerry would understand this
[42:25] you know he's so many furlongs
[42:27] you know he's behind and look at the
[42:29] leader look at the stride that he's got
[42:31] and
[42:32] and a stride like we've never seen in
[42:34] this horse before and
[42:35] and look at them coming the rounding the
[42:37] last turn
[42:38] oh wait oh wait
[42:42] look at him look at him he's
[42:45] straightened
[42:45] suddenly lengthen his stride he's
[42:48] suddenly putting
[42:49] oh my look at the effort the jockey is
[42:52] not even in control
[42:53] that horse is running it looks like he's
[42:55] running from his heart
[42:56] he's gaining he's gained a link he's
[42:58] gained two links he's coming oh they got
[43:00] so excited
[43:01] and my brother and sister when the other
[43:03] horse was giving out
[43:05] that horse was still accelerating
[43:08] and i thought there it is hallelujah
[43:11] when the religious
[43:13] are petering out there they're fading
[43:15] the bride of christ who must not look
[43:18] might not have looked spectacular to the
[43:19] world
[43:20] she's gaining more strength as she comes
[43:22] to the end of this race
[43:24] because this is the word coming to life
[43:27] in her hallelujah she doesn't say well i
[43:30] guess it was all this this and
[43:32] i guess it really wasn't nothing at all
[43:34] no there's something in her that
[43:35] identifies
[43:36] oh pardon me for saying it this way but
[43:39] let it just be strong
[43:40] it's no longer this is brother branham's
[43:42] message my brother and sister this was
[43:44] the message of jesus christ
[43:46] to the bride of christ amen it has went
[43:49] beyond
[43:50] a man it has moved into the spiritual
[43:53] element
[43:54] of god speaking to his bride hallelujah
[43:57] when she hears that voice
[43:59] no doubt that jockey which was some
[44:01] famous jockey with many wins
[44:03] they said oh it's his habit to talk to
[44:06] the horse
[44:06] in the final run there and i can just
[44:09] hear him purring in that horse's ear
[44:11] you can do it you can do it come on come
[44:14] on you can do it
[44:15] the mother jockeys i like this i'm not
[44:17] really a horse person
[44:18] those of you that know me but i like
[44:20] this these other jockeys
[44:22] are whipping their horses
[44:26] come on are you with me but he didn't
[44:28] have to whip his horse
[44:30] he was whispering he was speaking to his
[44:33] horse
[44:34] they said he has words that he speaks to
[44:37] his horses
[44:39] encouraging words you can do it
[44:42] you're a winner run
[44:46] run run for your life run my brother and
[44:49] sister i think we're not coming in the
[44:50] season of
[44:51] whipping of the bride of christ but the
[44:53] words of encouragement
[44:55] we're coming down in a final stage a
[44:57] race you can do it
[45:00] doesn't mean that every day seems like a
[45:02] good day
[45:05] but we can live in god's favor now look
[45:08] what brother branham says here
[45:10] in birth pains now this church is
[45:13] supposed to get a sign
[45:14] its last sign we find out here in the
[45:17] scriptures see now
[45:18] the great birth pains that's being in
[45:20] this layout to see an
[45:21] age it's boring i'm not sure exactly i'm
[45:24] not grasping that quite but
[45:26] their church is being born again not
[45:29] not they'll never be another
[45:31] organization anyone knows that every
[45:33] time
[45:34] a message went forth asked this
[45:35] historian after a message went forth an
[45:37] organization come up out of it
[45:42] that's right now we're not going to go
[45:44] into that but i just want you to be
[45:46] aware that spirit has showed up in the
[45:48] message
[45:49] it wants us to organize but my brother
[45:53] and sister
[45:54] i believe what the prophet of god said
[45:55] here it will not be the bride of christ
[45:57] that organizes
[45:58] it will be people around the world just
[46:01] as it was with luther
[46:03] that it wasn't about luther but it was
[46:05] about the fanaticism
[46:07] that come around it right you go back
[46:09] and find that what the prophet of god
[46:10] says about it
[46:11] see we we want to be fanatical about
[46:14] what we believe
[46:15] without being fanatics you understand
[46:18] what i mean
[46:19] amen we want to be sold out to what we
[46:22] believe
[46:23] without turning it into some kind of ism
[46:29] come up out of it oh alexander camel
[46:31] everything
[46:32] campbell everything else martin luther
[46:34] and everything they made an
[46:35] organization out of it and usually a
[46:38] message only goes for about three years
[46:40] of revival
[46:41] this has been going for 15 years and
[46:43] there's been no organization come from
[46:45] it why
[46:45] the shock was the last we're at the end
[46:49] now i'm going to say kind of strong
[46:51] words here those who want to pull the
[46:53] message
[46:54] into organization my brother and sister
[46:57] are actually shocked
[47:02] the seed wants to be exposed to the sun
[47:06] the seed is not afraid of the presence
[47:08] of the sun
[47:09] because the seed knows the sun is what
[47:12] ripens her
[47:13] to bring her to full maturity
[47:16] [Music]
[47:17] hallelujah so as we look at this my
[47:21] brother and sister
[47:22] i i see it's just such a beautiful time
[47:24] for our day
[47:25] see the birth pain see what's the matter
[47:28] just a remnant will be brought out just
[47:30] a remnant will be brought out
[47:32] and that's why i'm crying and straining
[47:34] and pushing
[47:35] and laying aside every favor
[47:38] of man on earth
[47:42] to find favor with god and just moving
[47:46] on
[47:47] in his word amen now does this mean we
[47:50] go out and insult and do
[47:52] no no it does not no but if we have to
[47:55] choose between satisfying what
[47:57] man thinks the message ought to be and
[48:00] what god
[48:01] sent the message my brother and sister
[48:03] we'll choose god's version
[48:05] hallelujah so we will lay aside every
[48:08] favor of man on earth to find favor with
[48:11] god and
[48:11] i believe this bride of christ is in
[48:13] that position because
[48:14] she has a revelation a key has been
[48:17] given to her
[48:18] and her life is now opened to the word
[48:21] and the word is open to her life right
[48:23] because the word that is calling her
[48:27] is the word that is in her it's not a
[48:30] different word my brother and sister
[48:32] the word that's calling her is the word
[48:34] that is
[48:35] in her amen right the prophet of god
[48:39] preaches this i'm not preaching
[48:40] something new
[48:41] amen the seed must be in us brother
[48:43] branham says it this way he says
[48:46] that if you are in god now you were
[48:48] always
[48:49] in him hallelujah
[48:52] thank you lord now you know i uh
[48:56] i like verse two the rich and poor meet
[48:58] together the lord is the maker of them
[49:00] all
[49:02] now my brother and sister talking about
[49:04] finding favor a person might find
[49:06] favor in his life and uh make some
[49:09] decisions what he thought were his own
[49:11] decisions
[49:12] and turn out they are god blessing or
[49:14] giving favor to them
[49:16] and maybe they are well off maybe they
[49:18] have you know a certain number
[49:22] excuse me a certain number of dollars in
[49:24] the bank and that might be
[49:26] multiples more than someone else but you
[49:28] see who we really are
[49:30] is defined by our spiritual position
[49:33] not our natural amen because if we go to
[49:36] hell with millions of dollars like the
[49:38] rich young ruler did
[49:39] it still is hell it's not
[49:43] hell with better accommodations it is
[49:45] not hell with a butler
[49:48] it's hell my
[49:53] so you see what happens is we want to be
[49:55] defined by our spiritual position
[49:57] of who we really are because the rich
[49:59] and poor meet together and the lord is
[50:00] the maker of them all
[50:02] now i want to i'll tie this together in
[50:04] just a minute on verse 4 as we'll get to
[50:06] it
[50:06] a prudent man foreseeth the evil and
[50:09] hideth himself but the simple pass on
[50:12] and are punished you know this reminds
[50:14] me of a little bit of history i
[50:16] read here a while back about a family
[50:21] uh they were of mixed descent part
[50:24] jewish
[50:26] you know that wasn't even accepted in
[50:27] their day but
[50:29] you know they had a jewish mother
[50:32] gentile father the family had more or
[50:35] less accepted them but there was still a
[50:37] little friction
[50:38] and when the friction started to warm up
[50:40] in europe the dad
[50:43] he decided you know what we're going to
[50:44] do everything we can do to make it to
[50:46] america
[50:48] and while his wife was not too happy to
[50:50] leave her family all the circumstances
[50:52] worked out such
[50:53] that they were able to go i believe it
[50:55] was into austria from austria they were
[50:57] able to go to the united states and so
[50:59] now they're living in the united states
[51:01] in 1939
[51:02] and things start to escalate in europe
[51:05] and before it's all over
[51:07] this man his wife and his children
[51:10] are all healthy here in america but
[51:14] grandparents aunts and uncles
[51:17] nieces nephews etc are purged from the
[51:20] face of the earth in germany
[51:24] and people would say you are lucky
[51:30] but the man would say no i'm not lucky
[51:34] i'm blessed
[51:38] because there was just as many voices
[51:40] saying don't go
[51:42] as there was saying go there was
[51:44] something inside of him
[51:47] saying we need to leave we need to go to
[51:50] america
[51:51] now we know america is not the answer
[51:53] for everything but at least to this
[51:55] point in time we can say it is
[51:56] one of the greatest places on earth to
[51:58] live and so it was there in a simple
[52:01] decision of go
[52:02] or not go that families are decimated
[52:05] or families are intact and so you see
[52:09] how in this times that we see that a
[52:12] prudent man foreseeth the evil
[52:15] my brother and sister the word says he
[52:18] hideth himself
[52:22] look at the day we're living look what's
[52:24] happening around us
[52:26] we have a hiding place hallelujah and so
[52:30] we can look
[52:31] by god's grace not just the whole world
[52:33] whole religious world is talking about
[52:35] oh
[52:35] america is doomed america's doomed and i
[52:38] was listening to a man the other day and
[52:40] i thought my goodness
[52:41] those are exactly the prophet's words
[52:43] this man is speaking out
[52:44] with no acknowledgement of the prophet
[52:46] but you know so be it
[52:48] he's there declaring what's happening
[52:50] judgment's fallen upon
[52:51] america they had an opportunity they've
[52:54] turned god down
[52:55] and now it's going to what it's going
[52:57] and it's there my brother and sister
[52:58] that you see that warnings going out
[53:01] but hardly anyone heeded noah
[53:05] go right on down through the scriptures
[53:07] you'll find in
[53:08] in all through the scriptures that god
[53:11] brother branham preaches it this way
[53:13] god always gives warning before judgment
[53:17] and so the warnings went out but all
[53:19] through the generations very few
[53:21] heeded the warning and god is showing us
[53:24] right here in the proverbs i believe it
[53:26] applies to our day i believe we can say
[53:28] that we are prudent
[53:30] men and women we see the evil and we
[53:33] hide ourself where do we hide ourself
[53:35] not in some place in the mountains not
[53:37] in some country somewhere
[53:39] my brother and sister we hide ourself in
[53:41] the rock christ
[53:42] jesus amen the simple pass on and are
[53:46] punished
[53:48] my breaks your heart
[53:53] i listened to a man the other day make a
[53:54] comment
[53:57] they're rioting in milwaukee it's hard
[54:00] to understand all that circumstance of
[54:02] that lady policeman
[54:04] we take the prophet's words this might
[54:05] sound harsh she should have never been a
[54:07] policeman
[54:08] she wouldn't be in her predicament today
[54:10] if she was
[54:12] a housewife
[54:15] at least i hope your sisters aren't
[54:16] tasing your children
[54:22] but you see it's there
[54:27] that we look at this and this man made a
[54:30] comment
[54:31] the rioting in milwaukee again he says
[54:33] why
[54:35] would anyone in their right mind lived
[54:38] there
[54:40] i couldn't question his judgment why
[54:43] would anyone in his right mind
[54:45] i say if they have any sense they'll
[54:47] move just not here
[54:53] forgive me for that little humor but my
[54:56] brother and sister you live there and
[54:57] they burn
[54:58] they burn the store across the street
[55:00] down last time and they rebuild it and
[55:02] they burn it down this time
[55:04] they're going to burn it down next time
[55:05] and they're going to burn it down the
[55:06] time after that
[55:07] they're going to burn it down and burn
[55:09] it down and burn it down
[55:10] because they've got a vice president
[55:12] that's saying they ought to do that
[55:15] they have a right to do that they should
[55:17] do that and we won't stop them
[55:21] yes my brother and sister aren't you
[55:23] glad our refuge is not here
[55:26] oh hallelujah amen
[55:29] oh hallelujah now verse four i really
[55:31] want to focus on verse four right here
[55:34] real quick you look at this now you see
[55:36] my brother and sister
[55:37] by humility and the fear of the lord are
[55:41] riches
[55:41] and honor and life now we take this back
[55:45] up into these
[55:46] verses the rich and poor meet together
[55:49] the lord is the maker of them all so
[55:52] what is real riches in the eyes of god
[55:56] it is not what you have in the bank it's
[55:58] not what i have in the bank or what we
[56:00] might acquire in a lifetime
[56:02] but riches in the eyes of god
[56:06] is by humility and fear of the lord are
[56:09] riches and honor and life
[56:10] and i tell you my brother and sister i'd
[56:12] rather be rich in god's eyes
[56:15] than to be rich in the eyes of the world
[56:17] amen you find that it's such a
[56:19] a different world that they live in
[56:22] they're constantly
[56:23] struggling and they have strife they
[56:26] have drama
[56:27] everyone thinks if i was rich i wouldn't
[56:29] have these problems no
[56:31] you would have them multiplied amen you
[56:33] see god's got a different matrix that he
[56:36] measures things by
[56:37] amen and we can only measure by the
[56:40] human matrix
[56:41] so we look at it from our eyes and let's
[56:44] be honest with one another tonight most
[56:46] of us would say we would be a little bit
[56:47] better off if we had a
[56:49] hundred or two or three or four or five
[56:51] hundred thousand more dollars
[56:53] that would solve some problems but the
[56:55] real problem we have the prophet of god
[56:57] i won't go into it tonight the real
[56:59] problem
[57:00] that we have the prophet said is us
[57:03] dying
[57:04] to ourselves
[57:07] i don't think a few hundred thousand
[57:08] dollars is going to help us
[57:10] die to ourself in fact i think it will
[57:13] revive
[57:14] life into this carnal man and carnal
[57:17] behaviors and carnal accomplishment
[57:19] so you see the greatest challenge we
[57:21] have is not really our finances of this
[57:23] life but is
[57:24] our humility and fear of the lord so
[57:27] it says by humility and the fear of of
[57:30] the lord
[57:30] are riches and honor in life now brother
[57:33] branham says here
[57:34] in uh uh influence don't you love
[57:38] influence
[57:39] it's a it's pretty awesome you know he
[57:41] preaches it several times but the crux
[57:42] of it all
[57:43] the overview of it all is just
[57:46] incredible
[57:47] to think how much influence now i read
[57:50] this article here recently
[57:52] it's talking about it and because we're
[57:54] not caught up in that world
[57:56] i sure hope we're not caught up in that
[57:57] world the movie theaters etc
[58:00] the research has showed that you know
[58:02] they'll play a movie in the theater
[58:04] and they will send these subliminal
[58:06] messages and suddenly everybody wants a
[58:08] coke and popcorn
[58:09] now they think it's just well this is
[58:11] what we do in the movie
[58:12] but that subliminal message that is sent
[58:16] is is speaking to them and more than
[58:19] faster than our comprehension can grasp
[58:22] it
[58:22] is the flicker or the presentation
[58:26] and that's exactly what satan does he he
[58:29] just brings it in in such a subtle
[58:31] fashion
[58:32] that people don't understand why they're
[58:34] influenced why they are and the prophet
[58:36] of god says you know
[58:37] that uh sons and daughters of god are
[58:40] not now help me
[58:41] with this my mind just is wanting to
[58:43] turn these words around
[58:44] amen brother brown talks about the glow
[58:48] versus the glare i think it is or is
[58:50] that right is that the right words
[58:52] help me brother david um
[58:56] see you know there's a glare
[59:01] in the world my brother and sister they
[59:03] they got their own
[59:04] to catch the attention but you see god's
[59:07] satisfied just to let the gospel glow in
[59:09] you and i
[59:10] we don't have to present ourselves as a
[59:13] you know this super spiritual that
[59:15] oh praise god you know i i ate a
[59:18] hamburger today and and praise the lord
[59:20] is the best hamburger ever
[59:22] praise the lord praise the lord we can
[59:23] just bless the food and eat the
[59:25] hamburger and say thank you lord for the
[59:27] food
[59:27] but yet you'll find there is this
[59:29] culture that everything is hyper
[59:32] spiritual but not lining up with the
[59:34] word right
[59:34] we want to line up with the word even if
[59:36] we don't look spectacular to everyone
[59:38] around us
[59:39] amen so we'll recognize that influence
[59:42] has
[59:42] has got a tremendous
[59:46] tremendous influence influence has a
[59:49] tremendous influence
[59:51] are you with me influence has a
[59:53] tremendous
[59:58] influence
[1:00:00] brother branham talks about jackie
[1:00:03] kennedy
[1:00:04] and her water head haircut
[1:00:11] talks about all this stuff we we just
[1:00:14] see
[1:00:14] the evidence of what he's talking about
[1:00:16] this one does it
[1:00:18] everyone does it i like that quote
[1:00:21] where brother brown talks about how you
[1:00:23] know the pastor's wife
[1:00:27] sister jerry please stand up
[1:00:30] this is like not in your life buddy
[1:00:34] but you see saints i'm glad that we're
[1:00:36] in a church
[1:00:38] that's not looking to copy
[1:00:42] or impersonate
[1:00:46] right yeah sister jerry can be sister
[1:00:49] jerry and
[1:00:50] every one of you sisters will be
[1:00:52] yourself
[1:00:54] i i'm assuming something here don't want
[1:00:56] to be presumptuous
[1:00:57] uh sister jerry's lovable she's kind
[1:00:59] she's caring she's considerate
[1:01:02] but she's not your god
[1:01:06] i want to look at her life and say you
[1:01:08] know what
[1:01:10] good sister just what paul needed
[1:01:14] sassy and everything
[1:01:22] anyway
[1:01:24] but look at this look at this what
[1:01:28] influence does
[1:01:30] the church where is she getting her
[1:01:33] influence
[1:01:35] it should be the holy spirit coming down
[1:01:38] in her midst
[1:01:40] now the prophet of god showed us that
[1:01:42] the holy spirit was
[1:01:43] timid amen so it's not boisterous it's
[1:01:46] not
[1:01:46] boastful it's not due then now look what
[1:01:48] brother braham says right here in
[1:01:49] influence
[1:01:50] we haven't got now go back and read the
[1:01:52] whole thing about this okay i'm not i
[1:01:54] i'm pulling this little piece out
[1:01:57] because obviously we can't quote the
[1:01:58] whole thing and this whole sermon ties
[1:02:00] together
[1:02:01] we haven't got to humility we don't want
[1:02:03] to and people don't
[1:02:04] you go sometime to a real well-dressed
[1:02:07] people
[1:02:08] in the church they'll come in and if
[1:02:10] you're not dressed just right
[1:02:12] you wonder why i use that example
[1:02:16] they'll look at you and talk you know
[1:02:18] and and it makes it they they shouldn't
[1:02:21] do that
[1:02:21] professing christianity i think it's
[1:02:24] just profession
[1:02:25] and not a possession because i believe
[1:02:28] that a real old-time experience with god
[1:02:31] will make
[1:02:31] a tuxedo coat put his arms around
[1:02:35] a pair of overalls
[1:02:38] oh i want that to be the spirit of grace
[1:02:40] tabernacle
[1:02:41] if you get a few extra dollars in your
[1:02:43] bank account and you
[1:02:45] buy something and you like that let not
[1:02:48] that be something that causes some kind
[1:02:50] of
[1:02:50] rift and riffle and ruffle and whatever
[1:02:53] else
[1:02:54] old time experience god will make a
[1:02:56] tuxedo coat put his arms around a pair
[1:02:57] of overalls
[1:02:58] and say brother i really believe it it's
[1:03:01] true a calico dress with a silk one
[1:03:03] we'll call
[1:03:04] sister yes sir because it isn't the
[1:03:07] clothes
[1:03:08] it isn't the person it's christ
[1:03:11] what's on the inside and we should
[1:03:14] humble
[1:03:15] ourselves
[1:03:19] you see we're laying a little foundation
[1:03:21] to get to our thought here in just a
[1:03:23] minute
[1:03:24] now my brother and sister see we should
[1:03:26] humble ourselves so
[1:03:27] we don't become lifted up now what
[1:03:31] happens is god is schooling us
[1:03:33] there are so many quotes tonight i could
[1:03:35] i could preach you guys till one in the
[1:03:37] morning here
[1:03:37] there's so many things associated with
[1:03:40] this but the prophet of god is laying a
[1:03:42] foundation
[1:03:43] that is talking about schooling it's
[1:03:46] talking about
[1:03:47] causing us to learn it's about god
[1:03:50] correcting us
[1:03:51] and here it is my brother and sister
[1:03:54] that we'll see
[1:03:55] in these thoughts brother branham uses
[1:03:57] the word child
[1:03:58] training which we will use in a quote
[1:03:59] here in just a minute so we think
[1:04:02] oh my goodness and i've preached here a
[1:04:04] little bit and i want to just focus on
[1:04:06] this for a minute
[1:04:07] as parents with children we must realize
[1:04:10] that what we are doing sometimes seems
[1:04:12] so
[1:04:13] so like well i i just want to let little
[1:04:16] bobby
[1:04:16] go ahead and and just eat that candy or
[1:04:19] i want him to just go ahead and
[1:04:21] be sassy it's kind of cute but what we
[1:04:24] don't realize is we're holding a
[1:04:26] child's future in our hands
[1:04:29] and we're going to create a child that
[1:04:31] can be selfish
[1:04:33] can be all kinds of of uh
[1:04:36] characteristic characterizations you
[1:04:38] know what i mean
[1:04:39] you know they can be impatient and
[1:04:40] greedy and ungodly
[1:04:42] because we thought it was so cute or we
[1:04:45] just
[1:04:45] didn't want to do that we don't believe
[1:04:48] in
[1:04:49] spank the child we don't believe in and
[1:04:51] spare the rod
[1:04:52] we will believe that we can talk to it i
[1:04:54] always many years ago
[1:04:56] listening to brother donnie preached it
[1:04:58] just tickled me
[1:04:59] you know we already were applying
[1:05:01] something besides this grounding
[1:05:03] and brother donnie preaching one time
[1:05:05] says thou you parents that think about
[1:05:06] this grounding you put little bobby in
[1:05:08] the corner or whatever
[1:05:10] he says you ground electricity
[1:05:14] you use a rod on your children
[1:05:18] there weren't a lot of amens
[1:05:22] because we want to ground our children
[1:05:24] now you just go sit there for five
[1:05:26] minutes
[1:05:27] now look i'm not preaching to no family
[1:05:29] or nothing i'm actually my point is not
[1:05:31] even in the children so much here
[1:05:32] tonight
[1:05:33] but my brother and sister we must
[1:05:35] realize we actually
[1:05:36] hold their future look at the time
[1:05:39] that a child is a child if you want to
[1:05:42] take it all the way
[1:05:43] to the legal age of 18 you're talking
[1:05:46] only at best
[1:05:47] a quarter of their life is a child
[1:05:50] and so what we do in that quarter of
[1:05:52] their life
[1:05:53] will have this tremendous influence on
[1:05:56] the rest of their life
[1:05:57] we can pamper our children because we
[1:06:00] didn't have it good we're going to make
[1:06:01] it so good for them
[1:06:02] we don't want our children to mow the
[1:06:04] lawn we don't want them to do dishes
[1:06:05] they don't have to vacuum
[1:06:06] i had to do that they don't have to do
[1:06:08] that what you're doing
[1:06:10] is passing your own uh conflict and your
[1:06:14] uh what is the word i'm trying to think
[1:06:16] of complex
[1:06:18] into the child and you're thinking
[1:06:21] you're doing them a favor
[1:06:22] but the favor is teach them how to work
[1:06:25] teach them how to be respectful
[1:06:27] teach them how to be obedient teach them
[1:06:29] how to be stewards
[1:06:30] teach them these things because if god
[1:06:33] was to spare their life
[1:06:35] you are only touching their life for
[1:06:36] that brief season
[1:06:40] and then we wonder why we have 45 year
[1:06:44] olds
[1:06:46] can't hold a job can't do anything right
[1:06:50] and mama feels so bad for him she lets
[1:06:52] him live in the basement
[1:06:57] come on come on saints
[1:07:03] so i just want to speak to you church
[1:07:04] and those that might hear this
[1:07:07] as hard as it is for you to take little
[1:07:09] bobby
[1:07:11] and make a little bobby do what he's
[1:07:12] supposed to do
[1:07:14] and do it in a respectful fashion
[1:07:17] and you say i just it's so hard to do
[1:07:19] that if you
[1:07:21] don't want to spoil that child you
[1:07:24] will buckle down your own self and you
[1:07:27] will pray through
[1:07:28] and ask god's wisdom on how to deal with
[1:07:31] that child
[1:07:32] because you're not actually raising a
[1:07:34] good child
[1:07:36] you're raising a good adult
[1:07:40] unless of course you want them to remain
[1:07:41] a child in your basement
[1:07:44] see that's the point that we have right
[1:07:47] when we failed it all
[1:07:48] else we feel guilty
[1:07:52] come on we feel guilty and therefore we
[1:07:56] make excuses the rest of their life
[1:07:57] or the rest of our life
[1:08:02] ouch now
[1:08:06] you know as we'll do this i understand
[1:08:10] you know train up a child the way he
[1:08:11] should go and when he is old he will not
[1:08:13] depart from it
[1:08:15] this wasn't just locked into spiritual
[1:08:17] things
[1:08:21] come on
[1:08:25] do you believe in allowances
[1:08:34] one of the greatest things you can do
[1:08:36] for your child is give them an allowance
[1:08:39] kill kids amen
[1:08:45] make them work for it
[1:08:48] make them budget their allowance i'm
[1:08:51] paying tithe
[1:08:53] i'm setting aside savings i have
[1:08:55] something i'd like to buy i set up a
[1:08:58] portion there
[1:09:04] and
[1:09:08] well my children shouldn't have
[1:09:11] fine you're going to teach them their
[1:09:14] whole life
[1:09:15] i shouldn't have to work for it it
[1:09:16] should just show up
[1:09:18] now let's take this over in a spiritual
[1:09:20] realm for just a moment
[1:09:22] we're going to teach our kids that
[1:09:24] somehow or another god's obligated
[1:09:26] now i believe god promised to provide
[1:09:29] for us
[1:09:30] amen he will provide for us but we can
[1:09:33] teach our children
[1:09:34] the difference of that stewardship of
[1:09:36] the word that god will provide
[1:09:38] for us but when it comes to these things
[1:09:41] if you need
[1:09:41] healing pray for healing don't think
[1:09:43] it's just gonna show up for church
[1:09:45] amen you need a deliverance you pray for
[1:09:48] deliverance don't think it's just going
[1:09:49] to show up at church
[1:09:50] you see there's a portion that we have
[1:09:53] to give back
[1:09:54] and the training will determine how when
[1:09:57] that child becomes an adult
[1:09:59] he looks at the plan of god
[1:10:02] my brother and sister i have prayed for
[1:10:04] people in different parts of the country
[1:10:06] not here in this church
[1:10:07] and they are like i don't know why god
[1:10:09] hasn't healed me and you're right there
[1:10:11] thinking this person has an attitude
[1:10:13] towards god
[1:10:15] come on my brother and sister when we
[1:10:17] finally asked the scripture says
[1:10:18] we ask amiss so it's now
[1:10:22] of demand that god heal me
[1:10:25] no sir what we need to do is stand as
[1:10:27] confident christians
[1:10:29] mom dad i took the trash out i mowed the
[1:10:32] yard
[1:10:32] i vacuumed the floors i did dishes
[1:10:35] everything
[1:10:36] that is the agreement of my
[1:10:40] allowance there's nothing wrong then for
[1:10:43] the child to walk to the parent
[1:10:45] and say i'd like my allowance i have
[1:10:48] fulfilled
[1:10:49] everything that was asked of me now
[1:10:52] you can come as i hope you
[1:10:55] understand my mixing of spiritual and
[1:10:57] natural you can come boldly to the
[1:10:59] throne
[1:11:00] and say mom and dad that whatever it is
[1:11:03] i don't want to
[1:11:04] see my number in case it's twice as much
[1:11:06] as you pay your kids
[1:11:07] but you can stick your hand out children
[1:11:10] when you have satisfied what your
[1:11:12] agreement for your allowance is you can
[1:11:14] put your hand out and say mom and dad
[1:11:15] i would like my allowance it is friday
[1:11:17] afternoon i've done
[1:11:19] everything that i was supposed to do
[1:11:20] this week
[1:11:22] with confidence now do you follow me
[1:11:24] tonight
[1:11:25] we can approach god in that same fashion
[1:11:27] lord i have come and according to your
[1:11:30] word
[1:11:30] amen i've repented i've been baptized
[1:11:33] i've got the holy ghost
[1:11:34] i've come in the right attitude i've
[1:11:36] come in the right spirit i've come in
[1:11:37] the right motive
[1:11:38] and i'm standing on the promise of god
[1:11:40] because i believe it
[1:11:42] now lord i need a deliverance i need a
[1:11:44] healing i got a child that needs healing
[1:11:46] i got a child that needs deliverance i'm
[1:11:48] standing on your word lord
[1:11:51] amen and god will not deny you
[1:11:54] hallelujah
[1:11:55] amen oh hallelujah
[1:11:59] hallelujah
[1:12:03] but you see my brother and sister the
[1:12:05] only way we're going to come to that is
[1:12:06] by training that's right
[1:12:08] you're not going to just have a bunch of
[1:12:10] converts come to the message sit down in
[1:12:11] the church and just got faith
[1:12:13] to stand up and take the word of god if
[1:12:15] they come out of i was talking with a
[1:12:17] nephew of mine i don't know if he'd ever
[1:12:18] listen to a service if he is god bless
[1:12:20] him
[1:12:20] but we are talking and i told him i said
[1:12:23] one of the biggest uh
[1:12:25] you know misleading things the
[1:12:27] denominational churches are doing
[1:12:29] is they're teaching everybody they're
[1:12:31] they're preaching about the promises of
[1:12:33] god are here the blessings of god are
[1:12:34] here
[1:12:35] all of this has been provided for us but
[1:12:37] we're broken
[1:12:40] we're broken we're broken when we fail
[1:12:42] god understands because we're broken
[1:12:44] well i'm sorry the blood of jesus christ
[1:12:46] come wash
[1:12:47] my sin away and i am not broken any
[1:12:51] longer
[1:12:52] amen because the blood of jesus christ
[1:12:54] has fixed me
[1:12:56] now you say but brother paul i still
[1:12:58] struggle with certain things that's
[1:12:59] right
[1:12:59] but if you'll look at that in that
[1:13:01] fashion amen i am already delivered i
[1:13:04] am already healed i'm already a
[1:13:06] conqueror
[1:13:07] you have to speak to your confession to
[1:13:10] what you believe what you want amen
[1:13:12] hallelujah
[1:13:13] so when we can do that we can we can
[1:13:16] take a hold of that
[1:13:17] but how does that happen only if we have
[1:13:20] been trained
[1:13:21] amen now my brother and sister i can
[1:13:24] find this quote
[1:13:26] if i moved it up or down right here
[1:13:30] here we go so once again let me just
[1:13:33] backtrack just a little bit here
[1:13:37] it might seem as though we're being hard
[1:13:39] on our own child
[1:13:42] but the term that they use is the
[1:13:45] formative years
[1:13:51] why would they use that term
[1:13:54] because it's the time of molding
[1:13:58] it's the time of preparation
[1:14:01] for the real world
[1:14:11] once again let me reiterate this we
[1:14:14] actually hold the quality of their
[1:14:17] future amen
[1:14:18] in our hands amen now this doesn't mean
[1:14:21] that you can't pour your heart out and
[1:14:23] do the best you can do
[1:14:24] and a child make terrible decisions and
[1:14:26] go off and have to take a rough road
[1:14:28] and whatever and it also i i happened to
[1:14:31] have friends that
[1:14:32] grew up parents were alcoholics smoked
[1:14:35] like chimneys and did whatever
[1:14:37] they don't drink they don't smoke they
[1:14:39] go to church their families mock them i
[1:14:41] made a reference about them the other
[1:14:42] day
[1:14:43] you know as one out of the whole group
[1:14:45] you're the reject
[1:14:46] and there that's fine i've rejected
[1:14:48] everything satan has offered me
[1:14:50] that's how they look at it my brother
[1:14:52] and sister we're not trying to make some
[1:14:54] very fixed hard thing here
[1:14:56] but you'll understand the influences
[1:14:58] that we have on our children
[1:15:00] and it's there once again let me just go
[1:15:02] down through this
[1:15:03] selfish impatient greedy ungodly
[1:15:06] there's influences in the life that
[1:15:08] causes them to be attracted or go that
[1:15:11] direction
[1:15:12] now my brother and sister i'll just
[1:15:13] throw this in as a balancing factor
[1:15:15] i know this uh situation i wouldn't say
[1:15:17] i really know these people but i know
[1:15:19] them well enough to identify them
[1:15:21] if i wanted to uh and uh the parents uh
[1:15:24] message believers uh still message
[1:15:26] believers to this day
[1:15:27] but they were so hard on their children
[1:15:31] it was unreal now gabriella's gonna just
[1:15:34] become my example a little bit
[1:15:35] you look so worldly with that strand of
[1:15:37] hair hanging over your eyebrow
[1:15:41] don't ever want to see that like that
[1:15:42] ever again
[1:15:44] you got a spirit on you now imagine a
[1:15:46] child
[1:15:47] right just i don't know why do you have
[1:15:51] that strand of hair did it fall down or
[1:15:53] did you put it there girl
[1:15:55] oh i don't mean to embarrass you it's
[1:15:57] cute
[1:16:01] but you see my brother and sister you
[1:16:03] are you following me
[1:16:05] when you hammer down on that child that
[1:16:07] every little thing they do
[1:16:10] you've somehow got secret sin you've got
[1:16:13] secret this you've got
[1:16:14] and just hammer down hammer down pretty
[1:16:16] soon that child is going to become
[1:16:18] what those parents were telling that
[1:16:21] child
[1:16:22] they were amen now let's just say for
[1:16:26] the sake of example
[1:16:27] that gabriella had a few things in her
[1:16:29] life
[1:16:31] that maybe weren't lining up so good
[1:16:35] we tell her she's a wrong no good child
[1:16:38] or we can raise up a standard
[1:16:44] and say these things you're doing
[1:16:46] sweetheart we're not gonna do
[1:16:48] any good for you in your life that's
[1:16:50] right
[1:16:52] pray about it think about it we love you
[1:16:55] just want the best for you but we have
[1:16:58] to tell them the truth
[1:16:59] amen right we can't sugarcoat it till
[1:17:02] all they know
[1:17:03] is the sugar amen
[1:17:07] and you know what's wild is they're a
[1:17:09] whole lot smarter than we think they are
[1:17:13] and they know whether we're sincere or
[1:17:15] not that's it
[1:17:16] so you see when a child is beaten on
[1:17:21] after a while they tend to pull back
[1:17:24] from that
[1:17:27] what we really want to do is pull them
[1:17:31] to it amen and you do that
[1:17:35] by one pastor
[1:17:39] church you live an example that our
[1:17:44] young people or anyone else would say
[1:17:46] you know what i want to be like
[1:17:49] i can see me living that kind of life
[1:17:53] sister jerry can i tell on you sunday
[1:17:56] morning
[1:17:58] we're there she'd curled her hair
[1:18:02] now please don't judge her on this this
[1:18:04] i'm i'm getting off in the personal
[1:18:05] stuff here
[1:18:06] she'll probably not forgive me for a few
[1:18:10] days
[1:18:12] i come walking in there and she's
[1:18:14] standing in front of the mirror and her
[1:18:15] hair is all curled up
[1:18:17] and she turns around and goes do i look
[1:18:19] too worldly
[1:18:24] now take it with humor because i haven't
[1:18:28] done my hair like this
[1:18:29] like since i was a young girl and
[1:18:32] i was thinking mommy she's cute
[1:18:38] but my brother and sister you see if we
[1:18:41] want
[1:18:42] what'd the prophet god tell us we do for
[1:18:44] change
[1:18:46] we pray we don't ridicule
[1:18:50] we don't cast down we pray amen
[1:18:53] there's where the realm of our influence
[1:18:57] comes into play that's where we make a
[1:19:00] difference
[1:19:01] in people's lives now look like i said
[1:19:03] let me reiterate this to you
[1:19:05] you can't sugarcoat it you can't keep
[1:19:08] sugar coating it
[1:19:09] oh sweetie you know oh son
[1:19:12] you know we've placed the token on you
[1:19:15] just do whatever you want because the
[1:19:16] token's on you
[1:19:18] you'll be all right god will bring you
[1:19:19] back nonsense
[1:19:22] nonsense we have an obligation to train
[1:19:24] them up
[1:19:25] even if they make decisions we don't
[1:19:27] like remember they're going to come back
[1:19:29] because of the training if it was true
[1:19:31] on his sincere training
[1:19:35] now in the message the job here 1955
[1:19:39] brother brown says child training that's
[1:19:42] what it is
[1:19:43] you believe in the scriptural trial
[1:19:46] child trial
[1:19:47] child training the bible speaks of
[1:19:49] training a child with tutors and so
[1:19:51] forth bringing him up
[1:19:56] straightening him up
[1:20:01] straighten up
[1:20:05] giving him what he belongs that's what's
[1:20:09] the matter tonight
[1:20:11] preacher says let the congregation get
[1:20:13] by with anything
[1:20:15] they need a little child training now i
[1:20:18] ask you honestly just speak out
[1:20:19] i i'm just is he talking about
[1:20:23] the congregation they need a little
[1:20:25] child training or is he talking about
[1:20:27] the preacher
[1:20:31] i think both because
[1:20:35] one the preacher is part of the
[1:20:36] congregation
[1:20:40] so now we've got the preacher letting
[1:20:42] the congregation get
[1:20:44] why by with things right the sugar
[1:20:46] coating
[1:20:48] praise the lord you're the biggest tithe
[1:20:49] pair in the church you can kind of get
[1:20:51] by with that
[1:20:53] well i tell you what we'd be better off
[1:20:55] by god's grace
[1:20:56] to be back in a living room preaching
[1:20:59] the truth
[1:21:00] than to be in a great big church and
[1:21:02] letting
[1:21:03] the biggest tithe payer do whatever they
[1:21:05] want because we're afraid to leave
[1:21:09] [Music]
[1:21:11] i'll tell you i'll just give you a brief
[1:21:12] little story about this i'll be vague
[1:21:14] enough you hopefully can't figure it out
[1:21:16] but there was a brother in the message
[1:21:18] got caught up in that spirit by god's
[1:21:19] grace
[1:21:19] he got delivered from that so they
[1:21:22] started
[1:21:23] preaching in such a fashion and they
[1:21:25] traded a church and they moved and they
[1:21:27] built this big
[1:21:28] beautiful lovely church 10 000
[1:21:31] a month mortgage
[1:21:34] and he found himself under this
[1:21:36] anointing
[1:21:37] softening up the message just a little
[1:21:39] bit because they needed
[1:21:41] every ounce of money they could collect
[1:21:45] to pay for their church but there was a
[1:21:48] brother
[1:21:49] in that church that owned a very large
[1:21:52] business a business that was
[1:21:54] did business in the millions
[1:21:58] and him and his family sat down and said
[1:22:00] my our pastors compromised on the
[1:22:01] message
[1:22:04] there's no way we can stay here
[1:22:08] a man who paid
[1:22:11] almost ten thousand dollars a month
[1:22:14] into the church and he says we've got to
[1:22:18] go to a church where they preach the
[1:22:19] word
[1:22:20] amen see how that boomeranged on that
[1:22:22] brother
[1:22:23] he compromised because he's worried
[1:22:25] about making his church payment
[1:22:27] but when he did there was real believers
[1:22:29] that says we don't want to go to a
[1:22:30] church that's compromised
[1:22:32] and the brother found himself in a worse
[1:22:34] position
[1:22:36] by god's grace god dealt with him amen
[1:22:40] we have a lovely church he's well
[1:22:41] respected pastor
[1:22:43] amen sometimes we have to go to child
[1:22:46] training
[1:22:48] because we're his children we're sons
[1:22:50] and daughters of god
[1:22:52] god's not going to just say well you
[1:22:53] made that decision i'm going to let you
[1:22:55] go
[1:22:55] god calls to all work out giant bigger
[1:22:58] pentecostal church in their in their
[1:23:00] area was looking
[1:23:01] for a bigger church and somehow a real
[1:23:05] estate agent said
[1:23:06] how about you talk to you and somehow or
[1:23:09] another i have no idea what the details
[1:23:11] say
[1:23:12] they have now this big church and they
[1:23:14] have a church over here and
[1:23:16] all is well the lesson was learned
[1:23:18] because god loves us he child trains us
[1:23:21] amen so i think tonight that we're going
[1:23:24] to take this position
[1:23:26] that the pastor is not going to let the
[1:23:30] congregation get by with anything
[1:23:32] how about we just settle on that one
[1:23:34] amen
[1:23:35] they need a little child training that's
[1:23:37] right that's what's the matter with the
[1:23:38] world today the reason they got so much
[1:23:40] in the natural juvenile delinquency we
[1:23:43] need some child
[1:23:44] training i think it's a lot of parent
[1:23:48] delinquency now i want to look at this
[1:23:51] we're coming down this one quote this
[1:23:52] reason i cherry pick this and i'll be
[1:23:54] honest about that i cherry picked it
[1:23:56] is because we have preacher delinquency
[1:24:00] we have parent delinquency and we've got
[1:24:03] child delinquency now which one of those
[1:24:06] is going to be where the guilt rests
[1:24:11] on the child
[1:24:15] but in reality it rests here
[1:24:19] or should i say here you see how it is
[1:24:22] though but when a child goes in a
[1:24:23] position
[1:24:24] everybody will say is just a bad child
[1:24:26] but how was he trained
[1:24:28] a delinquent preacher preached to
[1:24:30] delinquent parents and produced a
[1:24:32] delinquent child
[1:24:34] and then the child gets blamed for it
[1:24:36] and ends up wherever
[1:24:38] down in juvie hall hmm
[1:24:43] my oh my
[1:24:47] look at this i hear my son-in-law isaac
[1:24:51] talk about blockchain
[1:24:53] blockchain this blockchain that amen
[1:24:56] you brothers that are talking about all
[1:24:58] these cryptocurrencies and all these
[1:25:00] kind of things you know
[1:25:01] i forget the name of that that one
[1:25:04] everybody knows about what's that one
[1:25:06] everybody
[1:25:06] bitcoin yeah amen i'll tell you what my
[1:25:09] brother and sister you talk about a
[1:25:10] ponzi scheme
[1:25:12] people have shoveled out money like you
[1:25:14] can't believe to buy
[1:25:16] something they can't see taste smell or
[1:25:19] hear
[1:25:21] and when that thing one day goes poof
[1:25:25] they're gonna go how could this happen
[1:25:28] my fifty dollars turned into a million
[1:25:31] and now it's gone
[1:25:32] how could this happen was it ever there
[1:25:36] was it ever there hmm excuse me
[1:25:41] but look at this a block chain of events
[1:25:43] reiterating
[1:25:44] preacher delinquency church delinquency
[1:25:48] parent delinquency child delinquency
[1:25:52] comes down saints let me throw this out
[1:25:55] i'm
[1:25:55] running out of time fast here but let me
[1:25:57] throw this out do you know
[1:25:59] whenever you see a a
[1:26:02] uh dominating spirit nicolaitan spirit
[1:26:06] comes
[1:26:07] and it starts and it works its way into
[1:26:09] the church
[1:26:12] now i'm going to take this from a
[1:26:13] reverse thinking than most of you
[1:26:15] whose fault is that
[1:26:19] well it's got to be the preacher he's
[1:26:20] the one that's trying to dominate it
[1:26:23] no no it's your fault
[1:26:27] it's your fault your fault your fault
[1:26:29] your fault
[1:26:31] because when that moves away from the
[1:26:33] word
[1:26:34] you've got to stand up and say stop
[1:26:37] this is not right oh but we got to honor
[1:26:40] the pastor you are
[1:26:43] you are when they're drifting off the
[1:26:45] word and you come in the right spirit
[1:26:47] and the right attitude and the right way
[1:26:49] and say you know what brother
[1:26:51] we we that is not right it doesn't line
[1:26:53] up with the word
[1:26:55] you are actually coming but come
[1:26:57] respectful
[1:26:59] right
[1:27:02] but you see we want to blame the
[1:27:04] preachers well he was a nicolaitan
[1:27:06] preacher he calls that to happen
[1:27:08] the people had to receive
[1:27:12] the people had to receive it so if it's
[1:27:15] not on the word don't receive it
[1:27:18] amen and you know what we can start by
[1:27:22] pushing back
[1:27:23] in prayer that's right we don't always
[1:27:25] have to have a revolt and a written deal
[1:27:27] and
[1:27:27] take sides and draw a line down the
[1:27:29] middle of the church and cause a big
[1:27:30] deal
[1:27:31] split families and do all kinds of no
[1:27:34] start in prayer
[1:27:35] get serious before god god correct that
[1:27:37] man
[1:27:39] draw him right back to the center of the
[1:27:40] word
[1:27:43] the preachers let the congregation get
[1:27:45] by with anything we don't want to be
[1:27:46] that kind of church
[1:27:48] let's all submit ourselves to child
[1:27:50] training
[1:27:51] amen so that we can going back to the
[1:27:54] blockchain again
[1:27:55] we can not have preacher delinquency we
[1:27:58] will not have church delinquency
[1:28:00] we will not have parent delinquency and
[1:28:02] we will not have
[1:28:03] child delinquency if we just follow
[1:28:06] the word amen let's not forget my
[1:28:10] brother and sister
[1:28:11] the plan of god works that's the truth
[1:28:15] of it right
[1:28:16] amen now let's look at this one last
[1:28:18] quote we'll go through real quick here
[1:28:20] our foundation stands sure now remember
[1:28:23] what i've been preaching tonight some
[1:28:24] people might take that and say well
[1:28:26] brother paul kind of preached a negative
[1:28:27] deal now actually i'm telling you since
[1:28:29] i'm coming from my heart very positive
[1:28:31] i'm telling you it positively works if
[1:28:33] we follow the word of god
[1:28:35] it positively will produce families that
[1:28:38] will be glued together by the word of
[1:28:40] god
[1:28:41] and there will be this mutual respect
[1:28:43] because remember our children
[1:28:44] grow up to be adults and someday we'll
[1:28:47] have to face them
[1:28:49] good or bad as an adult
[1:28:53] now my children will always be my
[1:28:54] children my daughter is sitting here
[1:28:56] tonight
[1:28:56] i look at her i wait i don't look at her
[1:28:59] as an adult
[1:29:00] did i i said my daughter which speaks of
[1:29:06] oh how is that word
[1:29:10] a subjugated form
[1:29:14] of dominion
[1:29:18] i don't care she will always be my
[1:29:21] daughter
[1:29:23] now i can say that she will always
[1:29:26] be my daughter amen or
[1:29:31] she will always be my daughter
[1:29:35] but regardless i will face her i do face
[1:29:37] her as an adult
[1:29:40] my daughter if she was to tell you
[1:29:41] tonight she could recount to you
[1:29:44] many of her father's failures and
[1:29:47] shortcomings
[1:29:51] but i believe i can speak from my heart
[1:29:52] on this
[1:29:55] that we have resolved those things
[1:30:00] she's my daughter and i'm proud of her i
[1:30:02] love her
[1:30:04] i think she loves me and is proud of me
[1:30:07] i know she loves me i think she's proud
[1:30:09] of me
[1:30:10] do you follow me tonight you see we'll
[1:30:13] face our
[1:30:14] children not always as children but
[1:30:17] we'll face them as adults
[1:30:18] and as an adult they will judge you from
[1:30:21] adult to adult
[1:30:24] you did this you did that
[1:30:27] i did yes you did
[1:30:31] okay now look where we stand with god
[1:30:34] our foundation stands sure the
[1:30:36] foundation of god
[1:30:37] god laid in zion the cornerstone there
[1:30:40] we are
[1:30:41] can't slip can't slide can't move
[1:30:45] then we come into the door through
[1:30:47] christ put in here
[1:30:49] oh we may have our ups and downs along
[1:30:52] that's true enough sicknesses and
[1:30:55] troubles
[1:30:55] but remember there's a great company of
[1:30:58] angels
[1:30:59] all along the road bear thee up
[1:31:02] at any time so we're having troubles
[1:31:07] but we've got angels bearing us up
[1:31:10] taking you
[1:31:10] up when you fall oh yes he's there he
[1:31:13] promised it
[1:31:14] he had to make a way of it so the only
[1:31:17] way he could make was
[1:31:19] the cornerstone the precious stone the
[1:31:21] tried stone the elect
[1:31:23] and the name of the lord is a mighty
[1:31:25] tower the righteous
[1:31:27] run in at it and are
[1:31:30] saved that's right safe nothing can
[1:31:33] bother you any more
[1:31:36] now look my brother and sister i want to
[1:31:38] go back and reiterate this before we
[1:31:39] move on
[1:31:40] our ups and downs our sickness and our
[1:31:43] troubles
[1:31:44] but brother branham then moves right
[1:31:46] from the ups and the downs in sickness
[1:31:48] and troubles
[1:31:49] to the fact that we have a band of
[1:31:52] angels
[1:31:53] that god has placed around us to bear us
[1:31:56] up
[1:31:58] have you ever come to a place you're
[1:31:59] just like i can't go any further
[1:32:01] no life i just lowered my mind my i just
[1:32:04] i can't do it
[1:32:06] and in a little bit you just feel
[1:32:08] something and you just feel that
[1:32:10] what is that god coming down
[1:32:15] amen whether you want to take it in that
[1:32:18] literal form some people
[1:32:19] say well i'd be the holy ghost well
[1:32:21] that's fine take it that way
[1:32:22] take it as abandoned age take it any way
[1:32:24] you want it's god
[1:32:26] it's god bearing you up
[1:32:29] satan's saying i've got them they're
[1:32:31] going to crash and the angels
[1:32:33] come right in just start holding start
[1:32:36] comfort
[1:32:37] can i put it to you this way start
[1:32:38] making love to you
[1:32:40] oh some people get all weirded out about
[1:32:42] that i'm sorry you do
[1:32:44] because that's god they're just an
[1:32:45] extension of god himself
[1:32:48] and they start to make love to you they
[1:32:49] start to remind you god loves you
[1:32:52] you're part of the plan of god and they
[1:32:54] start bearing you up
[1:32:57] some people get nervous about that
[1:33:00] i don't know how they reconcile
[1:33:01] themselves to be the bride of christ
[1:33:07] maybe i should pass on that the name of
[1:33:10] the lord is the mighty tower the
[1:33:11] righteous run
[1:33:12] in at it and are safe that's right safe
[1:33:15] nothing
[1:33:16] can bother you anymore
[1:33:20] you're in the rock it's not whether you
[1:33:24] hold now
[1:33:25] it's whether the rock holds hallelujah
[1:33:28] aren't you glad tonight
[1:33:29] it's not about how strong i am how great
[1:33:32] a christian i am how this and how that
[1:33:34] it's how he has a holds of us
[1:33:37] oh thank you lord oh my oh my
[1:33:41] and the rocks done held so then you are
[1:33:45] safe
[1:33:46] nothing can harm you nothing can come to
[1:33:48] you unless god permits it
[1:33:50] and if along the road something is done
[1:33:52] testing and trying
[1:33:53] in you your trial child training as you
[1:33:57] go along remember
[1:33:59] his angels will bear you up
[1:34:02] hallelujah oh my goodness you know i
[1:34:05] love this when i see parents
[1:34:07] they correct a child instead of then
[1:34:09] giving a boot to them and sending them
[1:34:11] off
[1:34:11] they might spank that child
[1:34:14] and then they wrap their arms around
[1:34:17] that child
[1:34:19] i know a man that his idea is you know
[1:34:21] what you whip the kid and you stuff him
[1:34:23] in a corner
[1:34:24] and you let him know you're unhappy with
[1:34:26] him
[1:34:27] well that might work for him but i
[1:34:30] wonder if that might be that
[1:34:31] individual's view of god
[1:34:37] i don't want god whipping me and
[1:34:39] stuffing me in a corner
[1:34:42] i want when god corrects me i love
[1:34:44] hearing the word
[1:34:46] come along and remind me right after oh
[1:34:48] you know what you guys think that the
[1:34:50] preacher standing up here never gets a
[1:34:51] hide tour off of him
[1:34:53] oh my goodness my brother and sister let
[1:34:55] me don't feel sorry for me i'm gonna
[1:34:56] make a fact to you
[1:34:58] and that is is when you tear the height
[1:34:59] off of yourself
[1:35:02] it's not a good feeling
[1:35:07] because it's pretty hard saints to
[1:35:09] preach the word straighten it tear the
[1:35:10] height off of you then run out here and
[1:35:12] go
[1:35:13] that's just your opinion
[1:35:16] doesn't work that way
[1:35:20] come on amen
[1:35:24] these angels will bear you up angels to
[1:35:26] come for you angels
[1:35:28] to give you faith angels to
[1:35:32] move you along god's got a host of
[1:35:34] angels all up and down the ladder
[1:35:36] now he had to made a way for this and he
[1:35:39] made it through christ
[1:35:41] now when christ every time that god made
[1:35:43] a promise
[1:35:44] he had to make a way for this promise
[1:35:48] we've got a promise tonight sister amy
[1:35:50] would you come
[1:35:51] hallelujah saints amen i say
[1:35:56] don't spare the rod
[1:36:02] because if you start praying and
[1:36:04] demanding
[1:36:06] a little soft soap sugary preacher
[1:36:10] then you're going to become a spoiled
[1:36:11] church
[1:36:14] and then everything will offend you and
[1:36:16] you won't overcome nothing
[1:36:19] amen we don't want to be beaten right
[1:36:23] we don't want to come to church to be
[1:36:24] beaten but i tell you
[1:36:26] i want to hear the truth i want to hear
[1:36:29] the truth when other brothers preach
[1:36:32] oh i tell you what my brother and sister
[1:36:34] i'm sorry to promote somebody else's
[1:36:35] preaching but
[1:36:36] you know our brother andrew glover
[1:36:38] preached down at evening light
[1:36:40] fellowship or tabernacle or whatever
[1:36:42] brother tim pruitt's church
[1:36:44] here a few weeks ago and i'm telling you
[1:36:47] it's powerful
[1:36:49] he just laid it right on the line he
[1:36:51] didn't spare nobody he didn't spare
[1:36:52] himself he didn't spare nothing he just
[1:36:54] preached the truth
[1:36:55] their easter meetings brother ron
[1:36:57] spencer i i'm
[1:36:59] here again i'm not trying to promote
[1:37:01] anybody but i'm telling you there was
[1:37:02] some preaching there that was just
[1:37:03] straightforward
[1:37:05] it's time some of you quit denying the
[1:37:07] devil
[1:37:08] access it's time for some of us to stand
[1:37:11] up and say enough is enough
[1:37:13] it's time for some of us to say that's
[1:37:15] mine and i'm willing to fight for it
[1:37:17] it's time for some of us to stand up and
[1:37:19] say you know what i've got the word i've
[1:37:21] got the truth i've got the life
[1:37:23] and now it's time for me to display it
[1:37:26] amen there's a time there's a season
[1:37:28] amen the morning is coming my brother
[1:37:30] and sister and god is in control and
[1:37:32] it's time for us to not sit back and say
[1:37:34] well
[1:37:35] if god wants it to be he's already gave
[1:37:37] you the word
[1:37:38] he's already told you what what the
[1:37:39] promise is he's already told you
[1:37:41] what he has in store for you it's time
[1:37:43] for us now to stand up and say lo
[1:37:45] lord if i am not taking what is mine
[1:37:48] then correct me lord give me the unction
[1:37:51] he says right here in this quote right
[1:37:52] that he'll give you faith and
[1:37:54] he'll do all of these things for you my
[1:37:56] brother and sister
[1:37:57] it's right there in the word now it's
[1:38:00] time for us to accept
[1:38:01] the word of the lord the corrective word
[1:38:04] and come and say you know what lord
[1:38:06] you're right i'm not acting on what you
[1:38:07] have given me
[1:38:08] lord i'm not taking what you have
[1:38:10] provided lord i'm not gonna let the
[1:38:12] devil whisper in my ear anymore
[1:38:14] amen can someone say amen to that i'm
[1:38:17] certainly saying amen to that
[1:38:18] and we stand on that word and when we
[1:38:21] take a step
[1:38:24] we need a confidence right i remember
[1:38:26] one time a brother
[1:38:28] i'll just share this little example a
[1:38:29] brother come to me and he said brother
[1:38:30] paul
[1:38:31] i i was preaching different church he
[1:38:34] said brother paul i've been praying
[1:38:37] about this certain move in my life this
[1:38:39] certain step in my life
[1:38:42] and i can't get an answer and i want you
[1:38:45] to pray with me that god will give me an
[1:38:47] answer
[1:38:48] and i just asked him i said brother tell
[1:38:50] me about it he starts telling me about
[1:38:53] the situation
[1:38:55] and saints all i can say is an
[1:38:56] inspiration come over me and i asked the
[1:38:58] brother i said brother have you pushed
[1:39:00] on the door
[1:39:01] oh no brother i won i said
[1:39:04] [Music]
[1:39:07] her chance
[1:39:11] then under free moral agency
[1:39:14] god unlocked the door
[1:39:18] and then just waited to see what you
[1:39:19] would do
[1:39:22] you say well i believe god wants me to
[1:39:23] do this
[1:39:26] if you believe it your motive is right
[1:39:30] your objective is right it's not against
[1:39:33] the will or the word of god
[1:39:36] i said maybe brother god's waiting for
[1:39:38] you
[1:39:41] the brother let me know a few months
[1:39:42] later he said brother paul i went and i
[1:39:45] prayed about it
[1:39:47] i woke up in the middle of the night
[1:39:50] and it seemed like a voice told me push
[1:39:52] on the door
[1:39:54] he said i pushed on the door
[1:39:57] and it opened and god has blessed me and
[1:39:59] my family
[1:40:00] and everything i had a desire for
[1:40:06] saints the word says god would grant to
[1:40:08] you the desires of your heart you know
[1:40:10] why he said he could do that
[1:40:14] because he knew you wouldn't come along
[1:40:16] and say i need a 5 000 square foot
[1:40:18] house i need a lamborghini i need a ski
[1:40:22] boat and i need a this and i need a
[1:40:24] latin
[1:40:26] he knew that when you got the desire of
[1:40:29] your heart you would be lord i want more
[1:40:31] of you
[1:40:32] i want more of you lord i desire more of
[1:40:34] you i want to live a life lord that
[1:40:36] pleases you
[1:40:38] and my brother and sister i used that
[1:40:40] example of that brother i had nothing to
[1:40:41] do with it as an inspiration come
[1:40:44] amen an unction come to say those words
[1:40:46] but the brother
[1:40:47] shares he says i pushed on the door it
[1:40:49] opened and god has blessed my family
[1:40:51] and now i have a job that i can do this
[1:40:54] and have time for devotions and time to
[1:40:56] make it to
[1:40:56] wednesday night and sunday and to church
[1:40:58] things and all of this stuff he said god
[1:41:00] but i was standing there waiting for god
[1:41:02] to open the door
[1:41:05] you see my brother and sister sometimes
[1:41:07] god wants you to just take him at his
[1:41:09] word
[1:41:10] take him in his promise he said i'll
[1:41:12] provide for you
[1:41:15] hallelujah that provision doesn't have
[1:41:17] to be a midnight job
