forgive us for all of our mistakes our sins in the name of Jesus Christ and may you have the preeminence Lord in our midst tonight for your glory and your honor in the name of Jesus Christ amen praise the Lord it's good to be here today I'm glad to see that vanity has not taken over this church because I used the men's restroom downstairs and they removed the mirrors amen praise the Lord unless the women stole them I don't know amen praise the Lord amen uh it was like I wonder what's going on here amen praise the Lord God's so good Amen brother Paul caught so many flies the other day at his house think he's having spasms foreign voice is a little bit weak today but uh obviously God had something in store because last Sunday we went to a a waterfall and I just about slid in amen and then my daughter got one of my daughters got stung and then just the whole week has been a battle amen so we know God's is going to speak amen praise the Lord hey man let's stand and turn to the word of God Exodus 23 20-23 . Exodus 23 . 20 through 23. behold I send in Angel before thee to keep thee in the way and to bring thee into the place which I have prepared beware of him and obey his voice provoke him not for he will not pardon your transgressions for my name is in him but if Thou shalt indeed obey his voice and do all that I speak then I will be an enemy unto thine enemies and an adversary a two thine adversaries for mine Angels shall go before thee and bring thee in unto the amorites and the Hittites and the parasites and the Canaanites and the hivites and the jebusites and I will cut them off Lord may you bless the word of God today and Lord I I do believe God you're you're here to speak Lord and so God I just say thank you Lord Jesus in the name of Jesus Christ amen praise the Lord you may be seated and God loves trust us so much that he he even leads us right into our enemies uh sometimes we're thinking oh why God he says for your own good I I know what I'm doing amen and so uh even in these scriptures he led them into all his enemies because it was all him that would give the word and the life to bring Victory to them amen and so today we want to speak on a complete and total Deliverance amen and so my subtitle is are you ready to receive it amen Hallelujah that's the whole thing right there a complete and total Deliverance it's already been given to us Amen on the cross so praise the Lord and so Israel walked in total Deliverance in every part of their life as they put God in the proper position isn't that what what did Brother Brown speak on he spoke on adoption because we all have to come to our position in Christ and so as when we have that position in Christ then we can walk and talk and speak and do things that no other denominational thinking person though they'd be so good and so nice the fact is they cannot have the victory that the bride of Christ has amen and so I I don't say that message people have I say the bride of Christ has amen praise the Lord Jesus because that is a major difference amen hallelujah praise the Lord and so God would lead them into the very Camp of their enemy knowing that he had confidence in them as His People to defeat that enemy and they still had to defeat that enemy amen we have to push away that laodicean spirit and and and and get into the position of saying I have to take this word I have to speak and go forward amen because brother Brown said God doesn't pick us up by a caller and just set it into his will amen we fight for every inch of ground this morning but it's already ours amen and so he was confident that they would walk in a victory amen God's still confident today and so don't let it's there's we need to keep our eyes off of all of the other things that would that would produce unbelief we need to not look at those things and we need to look at the word of God which always produces faith and it will bring that total and complete deliverance and so it's uh because sometimes I mean even you know pastors and ministers get that the the devil tries to attempt them to be kind of cast down and and you know God's been dealing with me of what is that to thee follow thou me amen hallelujah and so and be not weary in well-doing amen because we're not here to please us we're here to find Sheep amen and to give them the word of God Amen and so the church has always been in the minority yes amen it doesn't matter what size of message church or church that people have God's Church Capital C is always been in the minority amen Hallelujah and so and it will always be and it will always be that way to the coming of the Lord amen and so because and so God seen down through time in the laodicea he says I have a lot of people there and I'm going to give them the best thing I can ever do and that's the revelation of my word amen and in that Revelation they will walk they will talk they will feel they will they will move in perfect harmony with me and no weapon formed against them shall prosper amen no weapon that will come against you in any form shall prosper in your life it can't do it it can't it's impossible amen Hallelujah well brother but you don't know my sir I'm not I don't even care about your circumstances right amen right uh because you've already won hey Matt you've already had the word given to you we just have to walk in it amen and so because the church today even though they're safe Sanctified and filled with the Holy Ghost amen some are living below their Privileges and in all of us to a certain certain extent because our revelation of God has to meet his revelation of himself amen and so God had to restore a word to his church and see they had to have the word restored brother bam said so that uh in uh ah was it the lap overtime anyway one of those messages and and he says the godhead and the baptism had to be restored so that the bride could come and be bride even amen and so he had to restore that word so that we could know what the Holy Ghost is amen and we know that the Holy Ghost is his Spirit In Action inside of you amen and brother Brown said that he will give you that Holy Ghost and you alone will know what it's done in your life amen and so you don't have to act like everybody else some people may act a certain way praise God but you don't have to act that way all you do is test that Spirit by the word and see what kind of spirit it is and if it's in the word then you got the holy spirit amen hallelujah and so he wanted to give the word so that we could receive the Holy Ghost amen because in this particular time of History which is in the time of the fullness with the Capstone coming down is that the Holy Ghost has been released in its fullness amen for this day Amen brother Brown said that in the in those other ages that those men had the Holy Spirit he goes I be dares not to say they didn't have the Holy Ghost but they were begotten and begotten means they're still in the womb amen he said he said this is not me and they said in this day it's a birth amen it's Jesus Christ manifesting in his fullness and so if Christ is here it is full that's today then we have full and complete Victory today amen hallelujah amen we just have to choose it amen we just have to say Lord whatever you want and so this church today recognizes the word as the only typos nothing else you know you don't you don't care what your favorite preacher says amen you love him you love to listen to him but that's not your absolute amen all you care about is the revelation of the word in your life that is the typos and so God restored his word amen and put her Focus back on him amen that's why gone are the days of the and it was fun wasn't it to go to all the camps all the meetings and and see all the wonderful speakers amen but we're past that now amen I don't need the special speaker amen I don't need the special singer I don't need the special anything all that I need is the word manifested amen and we can throw those those terms around all we want but when I literally I when I say that I literally mean this word manifesting in your life Hallelujah our Focus the bride's focus is back on her husband she's not flirting anymore and so God told Israel everything he would do in their life if they would keep he and his word amen you keep my Commandments I'm going to do everything that I said in that word amen hallelujah and he says just keep me in my proper position amen I want to be your head I want to be your husband I want I want to give you everything that you have need of and so the restoration of the word is about you the preaching is about you amen God gave his Prophet for you amen amen don't wait for him to come back because he's not coming back like that he he'll come to branham's right if your toes need to be stepped on I'm the man he he will come to his route he'll meet them in the air not you oh I that spirit amen that that is the wrong spirit because guess what that will keep you weak and you will go through the tribulation with that kind of spirit amen and so it is about you you know I'm not married to brother Branham and and I can't I couldn't have the revelation of my husband without him amen but I tell you what amen he wants us to put our eyes on to Jesus Christ Amen brother Branham if he was here I could say almost thus saith the Lord he would say get your eyes off of me and get it back on the word amen praise the Lord see this is about you not brother Brown not Joseph not Jeff not Bill and Billy Paul's the nicest most gentleman person you'd ever want to meet amen how many have met him oh yeah every Excellent Man praise the Lord but they're not my salvation I don't have to travel to Mecca once a year right come on hallelujah amen all I have to do is meet Jesus Christ amen and because their dad yielded himself to God then guess what I don't when people even talk about they start cutting down the message and stuff it's just like you're you might as well stop you're not hurting me because we're not even supposed to defend it amen I've already met Christ so you're too late amen amen and so it's about you today this whole oh you really think so you think it's about yeah praise the Lord and so it's about you and not about building a group or a church hallelujah praise the Lord and so it is the will of God for all God's people to be delivered amen every person in here is already delivered amen that's that's the way I see it and that's the way the word sees it amen but see because of the spirit we live under in this day because you know good people get confused they say well laodicea doesn't affect the bride really yeah who who told you that not the prophet amen Hallelujah but that spirit will plague you until you get out of this body amen amen but what happens is it gets good people to mentally consent that God can't deliver them yeah God in his word says I've already I've already I've already amen praise the Lord amen and so all we have to do is press in to it amen it's ours Hallelujah but the spirit of the age says oh you go to church you know you know worship a little bit and and you know feel a little bit good amen and and and then and that's good enough no it's not amen hallelujah praise the Lord but it's about you putting back your husband in his rightful headship amen hallelujah praise the Lord because he wants to deliver you amen and so if we're going to receive anything from God we must put ourselves in position to receive it so are we are we ready to receive it this morning amen are we ready to just let God be God let his word be his word and take us through every situation child training uh wife and husband training Financial Training whatever it is are we ready to let God do it amen Hallelujah praise the Lord I really like running into people who have who have been discouraged and who you know maybe they stopped going to churches message churches and because I want them to be able to meet a person who loves God and and they'll see that and that's for you and I as well is that when people get discouraged they leave they they just you know do things that it manifests they may you know they may get a mohawk or they may get whatever tattoos all over the place and and uh one day one of our Charities nieces were coming to meet us and everybody kept going now don't don't don't look at her don't you know she's this and that don't don't be um fixated on her and and she come in there she had one I think one nose ring and I'm like really I said in my in Oregon yeah that that's that's you get that when you're born amen and and no then you treat them like a human amen Hallelujah and so we're we're we want to be able to we want to be able to treat those who have gone away from Christ or have never got there yet amen but have been told that if you disbelieve brother Brown was a prophet then you're full of the Holy Ghost you know something strange like that then we want to be a testimony to them and so it's the will of God for all his people to have Deliverance amen remember that today amen and we must have ourselves in a position to receive because how many of us and I've been through it but how many people do you know that that they love God but they don't put himself in a word position to receive him and so they're always wondering why doesn't God do what he said he will do look at Gideon uh he's saying where God where's all the Miracles what happened and God's saying hello Gideon it's you it's the people I've been here all the time amen the god of William Branham has didn't die amen with him but he's more real today that he was even then amen yeah oh if you really listen to those tapes you'll hear him as he gets towards the end of his life I wish I had more faith that's it you're gone what are you talking about listen to those standing in the gap on Amen I wish I had more faith I God has to push me to do everything amen but see we have the benefit of those stories of those testimonies and now we can see that that we can just speak and go forward in the name of Jesus Christ Hallelujah in faith praise the Lord Jesus and so we just have to give God an opportunity right because in several of the uh indictments he's he says you know they bring an accusation oh I went to the meeting and and I had hands laid on me they said I was healed and I never felt nothing yes it's like well then you're still healed amen see if we're going to receive something for God we have to believe it and and and we have to keep creating the atmosphere in our home for Faith for to grow amen yes and so if we believe this word then no matter how long it takes then it will manifest a lot of us sometimes it's been years before the manifestation of the healing came but it was still the supernatural God right amen amen and so it was just as true that day that you had hands laid upon you as it was when it actually manifested amen hallelujah praise the Lord they lay hands on the sick they shall recover amen hallelujah amen don't let the devil take anything from you amen hallelujah and so if you're going to receive then just keep confessing say Lord I don't understand but I know that I'm Healed Lord I don't know why but I know I'm Healed Lord Jesus I don't know why amen that I have to go through these things but I know that I'm Healed or I know that you've put me in this position amen hallelujah and so if we know what our armor is amen and that we have the god-given right to use it then we will have Deliverance what is our armor it's the whole armor of God Amen it's that sword of the spirit The Shield of Faith amen the helmet of salvation it's all of those things and and to to a new Christian it's like you know you're trying to put all that stuff on Amen but but what it is he just naturally adds it to you amen as you grow praise the Lord Jesus amen Hebrews 12 1-2 amen one of the we are at in Ohio a few months ago and gave a testimony about laying hands upon a somebody at work and and he was dead and then God brought him back and uh brother David was there and I told he was he had been preaching and I just had told him that you know the next time I see that man I'm gonna tell him that he's a miracle the very next morning was my shift morning and we got a call to the exact same place and it was him and I got to tell him you're a miracle I just about scared him off the cot he was having chest pain again but uh they ended up shocking him like 13 times on from then on to the hospital but but I that God was just dealing with me about laying hands on the sick and just letting God recover him and so just walking by him I could see the line was flat and you don't usually recover from that Rhythm and so I just said a little prayer on my way by by the time I got to the heart monitor it was and so I gave that testimony and there was a nurse in there and so she went to work the next day and there's a woman with cancer in her liver and she came in for a biopsy and and so the technician come in and she was very nervous so she goes oh yeah brother rich said this and so which God said it amen she laid hands upon the patient and then the the person was doing the scan to try to find the right place and and it was taking a long time and so the finally she goes excuse me I'm gonna be right back and so it made the patient really nervous well the technician came back and and she goes there's nothing there it's all gone and she said that they all broke down and started crying amen and so that is his body at work amen all she did was take the word she put her self in a position in the word just to do what the body does amen and then the body manifested Christ by the word to somebody who's probably not even a believer right all right amen praise the Lord amen hallelujah brother Paul was giving us testimonies yesterday and it's so awesome so in Hebrews 12 1-2 it says wherefore seeing we also are compassed about was so great a cloud of witnesses let us lay aside every weight all those thoughts what ifs God I've seen this so many times and it Lord I want to believe it but it never works out let's just lay those down amen God's the great physician hallelujah amen and and the sin which does so easily beset us and let us run with patience the race that is set before us looking unto Jesus the author and the finisher of our faith amen and so we have witnesses we have people and there's more and more people in our local assemblies who are receiving the word of God and and allowing God to work through them because they put themselves in the position amen amen and so I really I've come to realize that we we don't really have too many normal people in in the fact yes we are oddballs but we've had we have probably over half of the churches have people coming who have been taught wrong so how can we become impatient with them what you're saying well whose standard are you saying absolutely this standard God's standard where you can search through the the message and the scripture and it all runs together that's what I'm talking about the standard and so these people need to see they need to hear the word of God Amen Hallelujah and and sometimes they'll respond the wrong way amen but as a father amen as a pastor as a minister we have to say all right they did that because of this amen I'm not going to take it personally amen and so I'll tell you what when God was it you that came to God or did God draw you to God amen that's right so right there you're out of the picture and so when God called you he gave you everything on your journey that you would need right then you mean I don't have to go to church and read the Bible no that's not what I'm saying he gives you all that you have need of for your journey right there and then amen and so as long as you are in the line of duty amen that's another thing are are you a wife are you a husband are you this that or the other amen if you're in the line of duty according to the word then nothing shall stand in your way that's that is thus saith the Lord for you this morning nothing shall stand in your way it's true anyway I I Don't Preach anything that I haven't experienced amen well that's because you're a pastor no no no no no no no no no no no no no no not at all amen amen that's you this morning anyone who is in the line of duty this morning and has a revelation of the word for you that will come to pass amen and so he's given you everything that you have need of and so amen who they are and what their possession is is because of the revelation of Jesus Christ you never begun this journey it's he that did it if he did it then he is faithful to complete it and so everything you have need of he has given it to you and it's by Revelation that's why Revelation is the most important thing to the bride besides discernment amen and so God does not do anything halfway in his economy we don't have halfway method well we do have halfway message people but we have Brides who are this little this little and and some are mature amen but not all the way yet and so he doesn't do anything halfway he all he does he sees you in an infant form as a new creature in Christ knowing that you're going to grow into the fullness of the stature of the perfect man amen Hallelujah and so because you are a wife or a son or a daughter or a plumber or an electrician or a carpenter or whatever you are or a firefighter Hallelujah then he gave us the greatest thing that he could ever give foreign he gave us the word he said oh brother I knew you were going to say that well then then just jump on board amen [Music] because the weakest Christian the weakest Christian is able to have victory over every devil that's right the weakest Christian and so that looks like complete deliverance to me man amen and so when you use the word of God Amen then he brother Bram said he brought every Divine promise into reach of that weakest Christian amen because Jesus defeated Satan in the wilderness and it's all about the Revelation the word we really have to get away from thinking that this is revelation it's not this is revelation amen and so we're not in this number by a mental revelation we are in that number by a heart Revelation amen hallelujah and so it's it's been our way of thinking and doing things that gets we mix it up in our walk with God thinking you know because I had it too oh this is the way a message person does and then you get the Holy Spirit and it says well that's not the way a message person does the bride does it this way amen and so we get all those things mixed up with our walk with God Amen and that is why our life seems unfulfilled amen yeah amen because we've mixed too much of laodicean message Christianity and those don't mix amen Hallelujah God wants us to not flirt with those with those ideas those words those other ministers Who Don't Preach the word amen though they may be nice people but don't flirt with that amen and and that's the biggest hat we deal with a lot of Hispanic people and they have a very strong sense of loyalty and that's good and that's really bad it's good if they have a leader a pastor or a minister who has the word it's bad if they don't amen and so we need to know what the word says amen we need to know who our leader is amen and so we have to get the things out of our of our mind and our heart that we think is the message when a lot of times it's absolutely not so God desires his people to walk today in that total deliverance and and you all you have to do is stand up we could have a Jericho March and you'd be walking in total Deliverance I'm in the rich I don't I don't see it I don't feel it and God never ever ever ever said that that's the way you know that you're a believer amen and I'm not becoming a conservative Baptist because we're I'm too late I mean I've already we've already seen the supernatural but what I do know what is happening now is that I'm coming to the Revelation that all I have to do is personally just walk in the word and now it's Christ and me in that little room amen and so everything that I say or do according to the word I'm just sitting there watching it come to pass amen and you have the same opportunity this morning you and Christ together in the word amen and you can walk in that total Deliverance praise the Lord look at those in the Bible those who walked in complete Victory they were ordained they were designed to it praise the Lord you ordained you are designed to walk in that complete victory praise the Lord Jesus I like that word designs God demands you to walk in complete Victory praise the Lord and so you and I are living in that day when God has ordained us to live that victory for both the purpose of us being delivered but also that we could be the light of the world too many people let me go get my pastor he'll witness to you oh no not how it works so you've already witnessed to him because it's not your words it's who you are praise the Lord and so he wants you to walk in Deliverance and he wants you to be the light of the world Christ was the light of the world yes who are you you are you are a little Messiah you are Jesus Christ in flesh all right absolutely all right amen that's what the message says because you have who's in you and so if Christ is well brother I don't like to say it quite like that fine as long as you believe it right I don't care how you want to say it as long as you let him be it praise the Lord oh I love it amen and so he has ordained us to be that way God desires us to trust his word so much he wants to be trusted he wants to be the apple of your eye he wants you just to allow him to do whatever he wants to do in his word in your life amen he wants you to come into Fellowship in that inner chamber amen and let him have his way Hallelujah amen he wants us to have his attitude he's not sitting up there saying oh that's a big trial Satan that's whoa you really did a big one no he's he's that meat eater and he goes my son or daughter has a trial lord they're praying it's already done amen I've already delivered them I've already set them free amen his his attitude It's Already Done amen his attitude I've already sent my word and healed them and delivered them from their destructions amen and so he wants us to trust him and have that kind of attitude in him for him and his word amen and so our walk with God this morning is about yielding our will to his will which is his word this morning he placed you in a local body why do you do that well you know so I can come and hear the word and have some fellowship that's part of it but he placed you in a local body so that you could he could train you to yield your will to the will of God Amen amen so that you can become useful to the body amen and so whatever he tells you to do then as we surrender to his will then we can live the word become useful to the local body and so the more we get ourselves out of the way this morning amen the more Christ will the more people will see Christ in US amen praise the Lord see it's always 80 percent of the people uh 20 of the people only do well how does it go again only do 80 of the work is that right and and that's you know sometimes people just can't help but when it comes to a body we can't have that amen and and we're going to see that in a little bit you're going to say you really descended into a carnal line of thought here amen it's the message don't worry see we need to get ourselves out of the way so that we can be Christ to those around us amen and we need to get ourselves yielded to the word so his word God's mind could become our thinking amen and so because we are in laodicea the word gets pushed to the side in our mind and our own will becomes engaged and has the preeminence amen and and our own will can look pretty and religious right but but we we have to wash that with the word of God we have to filter it in God's thinking man's filter to make sure that those things don't take place and so if we're a part of God then his he desires that this Union amen between he and yourself be your confession yeah right how'd you like to go home to a wife that never said she loved you no no no not at all amen well she says well he just knows I do does he I don't know does he see our relationship with him we have to let him know that we love him amen and so and that's where this quote God just doesn't pick you up by the caller and drop you into his will we must have faith in the word we must have it up on our lips speaking it and going forward amen hallelujah and we we can't expect to see taste fill smell or hear anything or even have any Sensations amen but we should believe it and watch it come to pass amen hallelujah but the farther people get away from cultivating the word in their life the easier it is for the devil to gain grounds in good people right Ephesians 4 27. it's not a long one Ephesians 4 27. neither give place to the devil that's all do you realize that's all Christ did in the wilderness he just didn't give place to him amen and so with the revelation of the word that we have amen we we we have seen that we do not have to obey any thought impulse or feeling that the devil brings even when you've been diagnosed with something and the doctors are so confident I've been there oh you're gonna have open heart surgery today you have you have vtac and and that's a block rhythm in your heart and you you go get prepared for open heart surgery we went home and prayed with our parents hands were laid upon me and I recovered amen so much that the cardiologist asked me goes what kind of a doctor did you say this was he goes your heart is pristine I didn't do that he did this Hallelujah amen and so I I'm not obeying the symptoms I'm not obeying the circumstance I'm not obeying those things well Brother Rich you're just a rebel amen no when it comes to that then you have to be you rebel against the faults you rebel against the unbelief you you you cast down all those imaginations amen so that you can focus this morning on this word do we believe the message or do we not amen and so since you do then let's jump in amen Hallelujah see the devil can only take from you what you give him oh that's so easy to say brother we could be here all day with trials that we could testify right amen let's see we have in our growth process we've given him ground amen Hallelujah but see we we do we get sick we we are given Trials of our faith yeah as a Christian you're already delivered but we have to grow into that we have to find that that's why God does different things for different people at different stages of their growth he will be more Supernatural to somebody usually in their younger years of the faith and then as you grow he's still Supernatural but he will he will let you stand on the word amen and the same results will happen amen but you groan amen hallelujah amen and so so we can never take background we have surrendered on our own we can't do it in our flesh your Spirit realm not your soul your spirit realm and your flesh can never take back surrender ground you can't do it because that would be self-righteousness so it must be God and the word in prayer that's what takes back that ground amen because the devil's a bluff and but it takes the revelation of Jesus Christ and his word to move off what is yours amen the Devil is a squatter he might be squatting on your flesh he might be squatting on your career he might be squatting on the revelation of who you're going to marry amen hallelujah amen don't don't settle for some good looking this or that who cares because in a few years they're going to get like me right some people are blessed with more hair I'm not amen but all those things will go away it has to be the holy spirit amen and so if if if getting married is part of of your desire then what does the word say the word says whatsoever things you ask and no doubt you mean God cares about that absolutely he does Amen so the devil's about but let's turn to Second Corinthians 10 3-5 the Devil is a bluff he is a bluff and and he has been on me and my family the whole week and there was a thought where I was going to cancel that I remember brother woosley who some of you don't really know but he was God literally told him to go preach at a certain Church well he went down to that church and he got so sick he was vomiting for 24 hours and so he he went to the pulpit nauseated he goes I'm gonna go and I'm gonna I'm just because God told me to he got in the Pulpit all the symptoms left yeah he was out and he said it was just strange that was probably the the best message at that church that he was God ever allowed him to preach and then he got out of the pulpit and he got nauseated again but then it left amen but it's like and so why would we let circumstances take us out of church on Wednesdays and Sundays well brother I have company and you know no I don't really know that at my house they're gonna stay and eat my potato chips and drink my pop and we're going to church right yeah see don't don't use those excuses well my family's here amen well sister Diana's family's here and they're here amen praise the Lord so don't use that kind of excuse amen right and so we don't want that but see in second Corinthians 10 3-5 it says for though we walk in the flesh we do not war after the flesh for the weapons of our Warfare they are not carnal for they they're not carnal but they are Mighty through God to the pulling down of strongholds casting down the imaginations and every High thing that exalttheth itself against the knowledge of God and bringing in captivity every thought to The Obedience of Christ amen and so Abraham and Sarah they prepared for the child well they made a lot of mistakes on the way but you know what you God doesn't even count that to their account he says they were faithful amen and so don't let the devil sit here and tell you because you've had some unbelief but it's his unbelief amen don't let the devil tell you that God's never going to give that to you amen because he will give it to you because you're in the line of duty praise the Lord we are completely dependent upon God that's all I can say Amen well he's saying because you're old no when you're young you're completely dependent upon God Amen wow what happened to the time you guys all right like Brother Bear he goes you all right you all right okay okay amen everyday people walk right over the word whether intellectual whether intentional non-intentional yet God still says yeah that didn't feel very good but I still want you to know me yes sir and and to know somebody is to be intimate right in that respect and so we want we want him to know us and I want to know him the correct way hallelujah look at a lot of good people get caught up in the cares of this life well my job and and you know I'm I have to be off and and have to go do this and you know it's it's because I'm providing for my family amen and so and what happens is they get so far into what they are doing or they get so far into their problem have you ever talked to people where no matter what you say it always comes back to the issue of their problem and it's just like yeah I mean they need somebody to listen to them but at the same time you're exhausted when you leave because because they really don't want to be delivered amen Hallelujah But but so they're into what is happening to them instead of what God has already done and the word gets pushed away that old song says sin will take you farther than you want to go and so you yield to those things and you watch that devil just pull you around by by uh that ring through your nose amen and a rope II Peter 3 17. ye therefore beloved seen ye know these things before but where lest he also being led away with the heir of the wicked fall from your own steadfastness amen so we have to be careful be careful who you fellowship with amen when you make a stand for the word not in your personality not be not because you're trying to hurt somebody's feelings but you make a stand for the word and other people who are not as convinced will probably not be your friend anymore you bet you have to watch those things you can't be flirting with Spirits amen uh we're not even see we're so far down the road we're not I'm not even talking about Pentecostal methodists I'm talking about message people you have to be careful who you are around because they are caring Spirit spirits of adultery the spiritual and the natural is the same spirit and so you're mixing your kids up with them or yourself and it's not because you look down on them that is not the reason but you have to watch what is happening amen amen you have to offer the olives branch of the truth and the spirit all the time amen but you can't let that mixing go on in that respect amen because if if you either love your kids or you don't Hallelujah I'm not telling you to separate from people but I'm telling you to be on guard amen amen and so for God to give his church a Deliverance they must be personally unified each individual has to be unified with Jesus Christ look at Joshua and Caleb they were unified together well yeah they're buddies and they did everything they had a revelation of the word they had a revelation of what Jehovah wanted amen that's how come they knew they were delivered 40 years before the rest Hallelujah and so for God to have victory in our churches we must be a unified body in the church amen we're to pray for one another in the church amen amen devil hates Unity amen he can't work in bodies where we're unified there's a difference between agreeing with one another and being Unified you don't have to like their behavior we help this uh she was a drug addict and and I knew she was because we worked around drug addicts all her life but I felt like God wanted us to take her to where she wanted to go so charity and I loaded her up and you know she's back there Don I'm just like I'm just sitting there I don't believe you you know and myself but and so that's hard for they said you would help her even though you don't believe her well absolutely because God told me to that's exactly right so and so I don't have to agree with you to like you even at the fire service that's a revelation but how come it's not in message churches you don't believe then I'm not gonna come for dessert anymore all right you're missing out amen do you see it's God looks at that as they have diapers and a big old bottle maybe that's just in Oregon I don't know [Music] amen but see he wants us to truly love one another love does not have to agree he wants us to pray for one another and for us to go on to with God as a body we all have to be unified in the same fight fighting the good fight of faith amen and so and so people think oh if I could just get to that big church oh it's so wonderful and they have all this and that amen do you realize that usually a big church means that God has left the people that's my opinion not everybody so don't look at me like that foreign you're thinking well you're just saying that because you have a small Church absolutely not I I never want a big church but but why but you say well why would you say that then because growth and perceived Revelation still grows when people have left God I can sit here all day and give you all the negative about every Big Church in this message and the disunity and the hatred yeah we look up to some of those right and and forget anything out this week let's just think back the other way right but we think oh it must be glorious to be there but see when when we don't allow Unity to come in then the devil just go okay I'm going to bring more members I'm going to bring more programs I'm going to bring better music better musicians amen the whole thing Hallelujah and so but see but see some and this is not all the time so but look at the smaller churches let's say 200 or less I'm just throwing out a number you're going to see a more unified group usually like say these are generalities but it's I'm trying to make a point is that just because a church is big does not mean God is with him amen and just because there's three doesn't mean God's with them amen but see we must be unified Around Jesus Christ to fight that good fight of Faith amen because in the wilderness in Moses mega church of two million people there was two besides himself of the original and then and they still had all the signs and wonders working Hallelujah yet they were spiritually dead amen Hallelujah and so and and I like it I've been in churches of 12 to 15 000 and when they when you sing the good old songs of Zion Oh it's just beautiful isn't it it's awesome I love it and so all I know is that God poured out his Blessing on those Israelites in the wilderness and they were all spiritually dead so I want you to think this morning God's Prosperity is different than what we think Prosperity is even natural prosperity and and I think that still pours over the message oh man it's just you know God's really blessing us we're able to get this new boat and this one-time Diesel and this and that and this and that and that it's like that's good because those are awesome things to have but but it that is really not prosperity and it's in its purest form and so God's Prosperity is different amen because in his relationship to the church so churches may get bigger amen but if they're not prospering in Christ then there's disunity amen so First Corinthians 5 6 it says your glory is not good I got to speed this up your glory is not good know ye not that A little leaven leaveneth the whole lump amen and so as a church body we should sacrifice our thoughts about something that the majority has voted on that hits home doesn't it I don't know what's going on here but most churches when the majority votes and it doesn't go our way it's like thank you you get into the car and it's like oh bed no brother Brown says do not do that Hallelujah we have to he says he said when they decide to build the new Tabernacle he was completely against that but he came and seen how the people wanted it he goes I had to give up my thought s Allelujah so we need to keep the unity amen and don't keep complaining about it well the pastor wanted it this is all brother Paul no that's right if if you see people don't understand Ministry at all uh the other day someone said man I wish I could be a pastor because they happen to see the teeny little check that I get I'm teeny and I'm thinking yeah it's like no you just I almost want to say father forgive him they don't know what they're doing because they really don't they don't know you just don't wake up on Sunday oh I'm gonna go over here and print this message out and I'm going to go up there and move around a little bit get him excited no sir and so we're to sacrifice our thoughts and so if the church votes on something how about showing up for a work day how about showing up and actually doing work on this church amen I'm just saying I I was see and this is confession time we had a church work day that we had planned uh about a month ago that Spirit of pests and or unbelief I'm going I kept going to change no one's going to show up anyway no one's gonna do this no one's going to do that and then the work date came and I was like Wow even even one of the brothers who hasn't hadn't come for two years showed up foreign I'm sorry Lord amen I said this is how it should be amen hallelujah this is good amen and so God had me eat my words amen which I'm glad he did amen and so the more see we need to get behind the decisions we need to put our the old uh saying Put Your Shoulder to the wheel we need to get because that brings units he doesn't it and you get to eat free food probably amen and so the more unified We Stand Amen brother bam said it will be Unlimited in what God can do in your midst you mean because I show up for a work day that's what he said that's what he said not me see we want to put carnal over here we think in spiritual over here when it's all spiritual and so for us to be unified as well we must be unified around the word of God amen and so if a church allows Ministry to not preach the word of God but their own opinion I don't care if you're 15 000. members you will never be Unified because the words not being preached there that's exactly right oh brother but they get most of it right I'm gonna throw up don't give me that that that's trash amen can God change them absolutely but as long as they're off the word those people are open to an adulterous spirit amen that's why you choose your church by Revelation and the word of God amen amen hallelujah and so you choose it to where you know that you're going to hear the word of God Amen praise the Lord Jesus praise the Lord and so if if that Ministry is preaching their own opinion then you're in trouble and so if someone and here's the other thing in your church if someone makes a mistake or they get hurt or offended for some reason then let everybody look around and pray for them or give them a card this is not about the pastor being the only one to show up this is about all of us as a body Ministry we are here to to try to make things right for the glory of God because we want unity in the brethren amen I've been trying to keep open communication to some people for years and during covet actually opened up a little bit it was good but you know they they just can't get over a couple things and I'm going God I you know I already apologize I never meant for this to happen because I love them but it's like God please let somebody be used to give them the word of God because I can't now because I've you know somehow messed up and so if we want the body of Christ if we want his Unity of the body in Christ in our midst amen then we have to get away from condemnation amen stop letting the devil condemn you that is not an attribute of a Christian amen in First John 3 19. because when he has you condemned then God's not going to hear your prayer First John 3 19-21 that's right and hereby we know that we are of the truth and all and shall assure our hearts before him for if our heart condemn us God is greater than our heart and and knoweth all things beloved if our heart condemn us not then we have confidence towards God and so if we allow God will spank us and that's called conviction and if we allow him to do that because conviction always points to life condemnation is always death amen and so if if we cast down that imagination thinking yeah I'm not a very good Christian brother Bram says don't you even let those words come out of your mouth amen praise the Lord and so this is why we all need to confess those things to God that are not the word that's why when you come to communion that's a good time to do that amen we want only the word in our life and so we need Unity with God Amen so that we have Unity with one another this morning and so we want complete uh Deliverance then we have to have complete repentance amen Hallelujah and so we want to have unity in this local body so that when people are in need who come into this place then they can get deliverance and because if the body is disunified then people come in here and and according to the message uh they they will not be healed you mean God would do that absolutely amen why because you are Jesus's hands feet mouth you are all of that amen we are we are bone of his bone flesh of his flesh amen Christ is on the inside and so look at brother round says just look at what God does in our current condition and so I can say that look at what God does Even in our midst right now just think how it would be if we all actually were in unity with one another oh hallelujah praise the Lord amen and so we like for that the the people of God Amen if they are to take the land of the promises of God today then they had to be in unity then under Joshua the Holy Ghost and and today under the leadership of the Holy Ghost and the word we have to be under Unity to take all the promises of this word as well praise the Lord we just have to surrender all of our parts amen we're almost done praise the Lord you don't have to change the CD or hope or a DVD I know that's old technology see Moses had a revelation of the word and Pharaoh wanted him to leave the animals and some of the people he goes now I'm not sorry I'm not the word says that we're going out oh we don't leave any person and so that's why when when as a body when people are praying for something a need in their life I don't care how small or big we're just saying Lord we're gonna we're gonna believe until we see that for that brother or that sister amen and so we have to claim and to possess all parts of that word is ours amen hallelujah and when you do that you put the devil on the Run amen and as you claim it by Revelation by faith in the word then you keep him on the Run amen you have the token applied to your home and the devil's defeated in that home amen hallelujah praise the Lord Jesus and so Moses was under Unity and this is why God has to send a send a prophet Moses was in unity with God Israelites weren't God sent a prophet in our day he was under Unity with God we weren't yet but when Moses had the Revelation from God to apply the blood that blood brought all Israel under unity and when God allowed our the prophet of this day to preach the revelation of Jesus Christ to us the opening of the word amen it brought us the bride under all of that word the bloody word amen praise the lord we are we are now covered we're under Unity of Jesus Christ amen hallelujah praise the Lord Jesus all of our all of our mornings you realize the the head of your that you have this morning praise the Lord Jesus amen all who are under your roof they are protected by your prayers and the holy spirit amen praise the Lord when everything is under the blood you are set free amen you can't bring things that are not God under the blood you can't do it amen you just has to be the word and when that happens then we have a peace that passes any of our understanding because it's God's peace it is not our peace it's not worldly peace worldly peace is that the stock market always grows and that my retirement fund I'm just going woohoo I can see it going up you know no that's not that's not God's peace God's peace is oh no there goes the stock market again amen Lord you provided for me before I was saved you provided right now you've provided all my life and whatever happens you are in full control when nobody else is working you will work if you're in the Philippines you pay your ties give offerings no one has chickens you have two or three amen he said oh wait a minute brother no wait a minute brothers and sisters what does Malachi 3 or 3 say he promises to destroy the Devourer for your sake if you would just tithe is just obligatory so don't even talk to me about tithe He blesses you in your offerings as well and more up to a hundred fold that's exactly right listen to the message this is not that that Doctrine did didn't all of a sudden show up in the 20th and you know around 2000 probably you don't know how hard it is to make ends meet yes I do sure do well you know I'm I just I don't know whether I should tithe on my net or my gross well do you want a net blessing or a gross blessing he'll do either one so why not just go a little higher and this is not because we need your money because actually I don't know but what here's what you need you need to have protection and that gives it what didn't we just hear it he will rebuke the Devourer for you that's part of the word amen let's get off that so we can get done amen so we will have a peace in our life and our families that we don't even understand Christ himself was so completely delivered into the hands of God you say well yeah because he was God no no no no no he was flesh and if Christ is our example this morning then we should put all of ourselves in the hands of God as well say I don't do anything until the father shows me that's why our decisions slow down amen and because there's a lot of times when oh just just think of this let me just you I won't mention but what what is something that you really want and when you start talking about it what does your flesh get like it gets tingly doesn't it it's like or you start and then then you just read about it all the time and you start dreaming about it and so your emotions and your flesh it's like man God must really want me to have this God please cut it off if I'm not supposed to have it well he'd do that if you truly meant it but see foreign Christ surrendered all of his natural parts he gave his own will even and you may not agree with this but it's in it's in the message that is what allowed Christ to go to the Cross that's right what absolutely that's the truth amen he surrendered brother around said he wanted to stay with his friends so bad why do you think he was sweating great drops of blood he said I I don't my flesh I don't want to go I want to stay but see we had to have a testimony that he was Victorious over his own will so that we can be victorious over our will amen and that is hard I got both legs up hey man both arms it is very very hard but you can do it amen amen amen and so when we come to the end of our life we just want those around us to say there's a real Christian that's right and more importantly I want him to say welcome I trusted you your whole life and now come and be with me amen come receive your hair amen hallelujah conversate receive a body that's 60 pounds lighter amen come oh when my father died my wife never told me about this until recently but the night or whenever I had taken off of work and I was there uh they called me from work and I was there when my dad passed away and when he took his last breath or so my wife said that she was praying and all of a sudden she heard my dad just laughing right running because he always talked about the The Meadows and he wanted us to run and jump and it was like but she goes I forgot to tell you and it's like Oh Praise the Lord he was released from that stroke body just running he was glad that he let God have his way amen praise the Lord Jesus we come to the end of our life we want God to say there's my girl there's my boy Hallelujah so Christ he he totally delivered you the Church of the Living God at that cross that atonement that he provided is things that are already given to you this morning amen musicians Christ at Calvary put everything under his feet so that you as his wife would be free from all of these circumstances amen amen that doctors are good medications can be good but just just put God first though that's what I'm saying amen praise the Lord put God first don't let their word Define you who your flesh is amen don't let their thinking Define your spirit realm because your spirit will pick it up right then and the devil will have a Heyday of it amen and so Christ put everything under his feet to make you free this morning the devil has no legal right on you yeah right amen you are sitting in the presence of God this morning amen you you've heard what the word says today among many other times with the ministry here amen and the word declares you free the word declares you healed the word declares you delivered from every Spirit everything that would hinder you you just have to put yourself in position to receive it amen oh he he would have gave you something better he he would have amen but he gave you the word of God Amen he is so good amen oh please church just look what the word says amen and just have that personal time with him and say Lord Jesus I've had this desire for many years and God forgive me for doubting God help my unbelief but I believe my children I I see what they're doing I look at them with purple hair or big nose rings Lord don't let me look at that let me look at the at the soul the seed that's in there that seed is God's Lord the doctors may have said that I'm going to have this condition all my life but the word says that with your stripes I am healed the word says I'm delivered Lord I don't want these uh these the devil wants me to have depression the devil wants me to have anxiety he wants me to have these feelings in my spirit realm and they seem so real God but the word says they're lying vanities that's right even though you can feel them even though you can see them even though they are in your spirit realm or your flesh they are still lives of the devil and you do not have to be bound any longer for any of those things because you are in Jesus Christ the word and he has set you free amen and so we don't have to be that way and Lord I just pray that each of us would encourage one another in the Faith Lord God let us let us just encourage each other to live the life of Jesus Christ to speak what the word of God says this morning Lord God all that we want is Jesus Christ and in him crucified Lord because that's the best thing Lord hallelujah oh praise the Lord I just remember that testimony of that woman and brother Brown prayed for her to have a child and it was thus saith the Lord in 10 years I think the testimony is went by she says brother Branham I never got that child because I didn't believe [Music] he said well sister your unbelief doesn't hinder the plan of God you're gonna you're gonna have it anyway because it was thus saith the Lord what difference is the scripture the scriptures thus saith the Lord to us today you believe it and you go forward amen that governs your family yourself your job your career your school any husband that is left you can pray if you love that husband in the name of Jesus Christ and bind that demon upon Him and He will return in the name of Jesus Christ because you have prayed the bride has prayed because in Revelation it says the spirit and the bride says come you have the same voice you are full of The Same Spirit you have the same word and you should have the same success this morning they're delivered amen we just say praise be to God what a mighty God that we serve God this is all about you Lord God I just I have people that hate me and I and I don't like it and God I love their souls I love them with all my heart Lord I just speak them into existence Lord God I want them to to to come to you I want them to to to to come to the point where they could just be my friend again Lord God that's my desire Lord I don't care what I have to do strip me down I don't care but I just want I want that love again Lord God I'm so grateful for you I'm so grateful for these people Lord we we just we thank you so much that you have placed yourself in Nampa Lord God yes there's other churches in Idaho praise God and I don't know them all I know is here but God this is where the Fountain of the word is coming forth [Music] and we should appreciate that [Music] God it says that your servants are worthy of double honor I believe that Lord I just say thank you for the ministry that is here Lord God let them always stand God let them not be weary and well doing Lord may they always cast down any attitude that the devil wants them to have towards towards being persecuted Lord God I pray for that in the name of Jesus Christ and God most of all each and every person that is here today May the Holy Spirit reveal yourself and bring yourself to life in their life and their soul lord God may they begin just to accept the words of God and let the word overtake them Lord in the name of Jesus Christ I pray for that in the name of Jesus Amen someone needs to come sing or do something Hallelujah praise the Lord [Music] you know Saints are just amazing how God works you know as we were talking about having the little harvest party for the weekend I just felt led to send that to Brother Rich I sent it to others in in the Northwest here also to invite him that Brother Rich was like hey did you mean to send that to us that's yes we meant to it brother Rich says you know we've been having a little stressful time in our family church life whatever and we want to get away but I say this morning amen God let stress fall on the cobb family that they would come thinking they were coming to Idaho for some relief but it really was for us amen and so we look at that and realize just how incredible the Lord is how that he would just allow someone to be moved that they would come and preach the word to us and it would make such a difference in our lives and I have to say today which I'll take this up with Brother Rich later but um I wished he hadn't stomped on my right foot quite so much uh but it's good it's good because we as the bride of Christ as Believers our first and foremost desire is to be right amen with the Lord yeah you know the devil would like us to just have an opinion and we all have one but at the end of the day isn't it beautiful that we find that God's causing our opinion to be his opinion our thoughts to be his thoughts our desires or his desires and it's taking place in such a fashion that is not by force right we we can be compelled to comply or we can be moved by the Holy Ghost to desire and I say thank you Lord for the moving of the holy spirit that causes us to say Lord I want to be like you amen I want to I want to live the word I want to be the word and how beautiful that is and if you don't mind just miscommenting a couple things here that just struck me you know as Brother Rich was preaching come to me I just read this and I can't for the life of me but remember I want to say it's the Oddball but I'm kind of nervous to say it's actually in the Oddball but the prophet of God will paraphrase it he says you know where the presence of God is the Supernatural is present now Church do we want to be that cold dead Church Brother Rich was talking about or do we want to be the supernatural hey man let's throw aside every opinion and every little thing that we have every ISM and let's make this as he was preaching today in an atmosphere the God would come down and move in we could say but I disagree about that well Hallelujah are you ever coming back for dessert [Music] I want the word to be preached and when it's preached the power of God in us moving Our Lives amen not us just saying I just read this quote brother but I'm saying the people come to church and they go home and say oh I guess that was good [Music] I want to go home and say I'm in love come down and walk the aisles of our church today but not only that he came by my Pew amen amen amen because God promised the supernatural take place I say Church let's let the supernatural place in our lives in our assembly amen one last comment do I can I sorry to preach I'm trying to break this habit but sometimes things just happen and stirs your heart I wrote this down in this fashion Lord let us learn the difference between God's promise with our name on it and Satan's promise with our name on it let us learn the difference every one of those left Egypt under a promise for a Promised Land [Music] that's right everyone will we finish or fall I say we're finishers Hallelujah let's just stand amen and just Worship the Lord for a few minutes amen you don't have a little prayer request saints that I would just like to throw out to you we had a family uh leave a message on the answering machine and it's garbled and there's enough noise and enough whatever we've tried to call the phone number that was associated with it with no answer but they were trying to find the church and let's just pray maybe before we leave today that God would just anoint them to contact us again amen they gave us an address but you can't understand it but no phone number and the phone number doesn't seem to be connected [Music] this desire if God's got someone in this Valley Brother Rich hit it I don't care if Grace Tabernacle ever outgrows this building if the Lord's in these walls but what's more important is God is in the building and that building is not this building that's right amen amen hallelujah wasn't it good this morning when we say thank you Lord amen and amen thank you for the stress that was placed in the cop's life amen Hallelujah [Music] [Applause] I exalty amen [Music] [Music] [Applause] [Music] oh my Lord eyes [Music] oh [Music] Lord for thou O Lord of all the Earth [Music] [Music] Thou Art exalted far above all God we exalty we need [Music] Lord we exalty we exalty [Music] be exalty [Music] oh Lord make it personal oh I exhausted [Music] eyes of things [Music] [Music] [Music] I love being foreign Hallelujah let me put Clarity on my little statement there you see if it hadn't been something happening that stirred them we would not heard this service so I just have to thank the Lord he knew how to move to bring them and I say Lord if I must go through stress that's it if you must go through stress to be moved into the correct position that our lives would be a witness then I say Lord move us there's a land beyond the river Hallelujah you know I normally on a Sunday morning you know I sing these songs the Lord laid on my heart as I'm studying putting it you might say to page to the PIN to the page but this morning God allowed me to sit here and be inspired right here on thecube Amen there's a land beyond the river Saints it's not a story it's not a song it is reality and Hallelujah brother Jason lead us
