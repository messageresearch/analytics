[29:16] o glory my soul is made perfect in love
[29:23] my prayer has prevailed
[29:26] and this moment i know
[29:30] the blood is applied
[29:34] i am wider than snow
[29:38] oh
[29:38] wider than snow
[29:41] yes wider than snow
[29:45] now wash me and i
[29:49] shall be wider god bless you
[29:54] [Music]
[29:58] you believe you can be whiter than snow
[30:00] how many is whiter than snow
[30:03] amen why the washing of the water of the
[30:06] word amen amen amen the washing of the
[30:10] blood
[30:11] amen life comes through the blood
[30:14] no other way does god's life come but
[30:16] through the blood
[30:17] that's the only way it comes so the way
[30:19] it can come
[30:21] and the life in that blood is the token
[30:23] you can claim to believe the blood all
[30:24] you want but until you have the token
[30:26] you know have no identification
[30:28] that you believe and have faith in that
[30:30] blood
[30:32] that's a striking statement isn't it but
[30:34] that's the truth amen god bless you i
[30:36] think i'm
[30:38] here with songs
[30:40] did you get that
[30:41] the token is the identification
[30:45] that you have come through the blood
[30:48] it's the only identification and it's
[30:50] the required identification today
[30:52] you're not making a rapture without the
[30:54] token the token is the literal life of
[30:57] jesus christ that will recognize
[31:00] the word promise for the hour and
[31:02] live it
[31:05] amen
[31:07] amen so that that's what comes through
[31:09] the blood
[31:11] there's a lot of professors that believe
[31:12] in the blood
[31:14] but no token
[31:17] you see there's something that follows
[31:19] the baptism of the holy ghost we know
[31:20] the baptism of the holy ghost is the new
[31:23] birth
[31:24] how many know that
[31:27] the baptism of the holy ghost made way
[31:28] for the holy ghost himself
[31:31] to come right down
[31:33] in perfection again back to the word
[31:37] where would he be found today
[31:39] in mary
[31:43] where would he be found today in the
[31:45] bride
[31:48] she had a revealed mystery that only she
[31:50] knew
[31:53] amen i'm not going to preach on paul's
[31:55] message but i i had that already to
[31:57] preach and he preached my message
[32:01] now that's how close it is
[32:04] but i want to carry on maybe with
[32:05] something on that a little bit here and
[32:07] i want to title this sermon this morning
[32:09] in bride alone
[32:12] in bride alone the mystery was revealed
[32:17] as it was in mary
[32:19] so is it in the bride alone by the same
[32:21] power only that's a natural birth this
[32:24] is a supernatural birth leading to a
[32:26] natural supernatural body
[32:30] amen are you with me that's waiting for
[32:32] us
[32:33] amen but unless we come through that
[32:35] union first we'll never be there
[32:40] amen that's right you've got to have the
[32:42] token that can may not be overemphasized
[32:45] revelation of the word
[32:47] amen in you living it's a little stone
[32:50] living
[32:51] remember the capstone and i'm going to
[32:53] say this is way ahead of my message here
[32:55] but the capstone was in the pyramid
[32:59] it wasn't till the seventh angel's
[33:01] message was that capstone revealed
[33:05] you say well it's been revealed all the
[33:06] way through that's right we knew who the
[33:08] capstone was but now we see who he is
[33:11] and what form he said he would be in to
[33:14] rapture a church in this hour it's still
[33:16] his working
[33:17] amen
[33:19] it's his working
[33:21] it's his doing
[33:25] amen it's his it's not anything that we
[33:27] could do but it's grace a headstone
[33:30] coming with crying grace grace unto it
[33:33] unto what who's crying who's crying
[33:35] grace grace
[33:36] it's the grace of god you see
[33:39] we have life
[33:41] we are elect with life
[33:43] we have a little stone a revealed word
[33:46] in us
[33:47] living word we are the living word
[33:49] we are eternal life made manifest in
[33:52] human bodies
[33:53] time bodies
[33:56] you see that's pretty rough statements
[33:58] brother david that's pretty straight but
[33:59] it is straight but that's what the
[34:01] message is today the seventh seal is
[34:03] revealed
[34:05] but it's not known to the public it's
[34:07] only known to her alone
[34:09] and now you know where we're going
[34:11] amen
[34:14] i want to read something to you before i
[34:15] take the scriptures but before we do
[34:17] let's just bow our heads for a word of
[34:18] prayer
[34:19] our heavenly father we thank you that
[34:21] you are here
[34:23] hallelujah
[34:26] you are here to feed the bride you are
[34:29] here because you and your bride are
[34:33] becoming one for the wedding supper as
[34:35] you pour yourself into her
[34:39] they are becoming one for the great
[34:41] celebration that we're looking forward
[34:43] to and are caught away and are meeting
[34:45] in the air because at that time the
[34:47] wedding supper follows
[34:50] we're so thankful for this great union
[34:52] lord
[34:54] this secret union this spiritual union
[34:59] lord of the coming
[35:01] son
[35:03] lord we're so thankful for this great
[35:05] time that we have
[35:07] in this hour because we know that the
[35:10] message of the seventh angel was the
[35:11] revealing of those seven seals
[35:14] it was the third pull we know it was the
[35:16] opening of the word
[35:17] and father people may say brother david
[35:19] you're too deep but there's one thing
[35:21] i'm doing i'm sowing seed
[35:24] lord it's got to take life your word
[35:26] will never return to your void
[35:28] but it will accomplish what you've sent
[35:30] it to do lord and i'm praying that this
[35:32] seed is sown is sown in the right ground
[35:36] that can receive that he that has an ear
[35:38] to hear let him hear what the spirit
[35:41] saith unto the churches
[35:43] lord we've had a a great unveiling a
[35:46] full unveiling a complete revelation of
[35:49] the word given to us things that those
[35:51] in the ages longed for to see lord
[35:55] the apostles those things were hid they
[35:57] spoke of it's not out of the word it's
[35:58] in the word but lord the full revelation
[36:01] hadn't come out yet
[36:04] but lord in this hour we're carrying
[36:06] that revelation
[36:09] we're bearing your
[36:10] name now father i ask you to take these
[36:14] lips of clay and you speak
[36:16] for i can do nothing in my own self
[36:19] i need you lord and i'm so thankful that
[36:22] you're present
[36:23] and you're ready to not only anoint my
[36:25] lips to speak your words and i'm
[36:27] expecting you to speak
[36:29] and speak what the message has spoken
[36:32] because lord there's a bride today who
[36:34] is
[36:35] under her messenger the final voice
[36:39] that's what that's what joseph that's
[36:41] what god vindicated to joseph that mary
[36:44] had that voice
[36:48] lord she had to voice that out and it
[36:50] was unusual to him but you backed it up
[36:52] and you vindicated that voice to be your
[36:54] voice
[36:56] and so father here we are today
[36:59] with a great revelation unfolding
[37:02] to a body change
[37:05] that's what we expect it to do lord
[37:07] because rapture has begun
[37:09] in the heart of your bride
[37:11] we thank you lord that it's changing us
[37:13] from glory to glory he's changing me
[37:17] hallelujah
[37:19] i can't get enough of it father it just
[37:21] is overwhelming sometimes but lord i'm
[37:24] on to you and asking you to speak your
[37:27] thoughts this morning
[37:29] not mine open hearts to receive it in
[37:31] here may we leave here raised to a
[37:33] higher plane
[37:35] we ask these things in thy name the lord
[37:37] jesus christ
[37:39] amen
[37:41] amen
[37:44] they're speaking about the subject the
[37:46] capstone revelation
[37:50] of the creation of god
[37:51] or the capstone revelation of the whole
[37:53] thing
[37:56] now that's that's a powerful statement
[37:58] you say brother david to take a stand
[38:00] like that and speak a word like that it
[38:02] would be
[38:04] pretty powerful
[38:06] but we have a powerful message
[38:08] and it's so powerful it's going to
[38:10] change our mortal bodies
[38:13] and it is
[38:14] little by little we're possessing the
[38:16] land
[38:18] amen
[38:20] the land's been opened to us brother
[38:22] sister
[38:23] what are you going to do about this
[38:24] jesus called christ
[38:27] amen that's the land
[38:30] possess all he is
[38:33] amen amen he gave it to us he's open we
[38:36] noticed the angel standing in revelation
[38:38] 10 2 with an open book
[38:40] and the prophet said this sword was put
[38:42] in my hand but he said it was the word
[38:47] he said it he said it was the word in
[38:50] the hand
[38:53] amen we saw a mighty angel stand with a
[38:57] word open book in his hand
[38:59] now in that book contains revelation
[39:01] that's been sealed since the foundation
[39:03] of the world
[39:04] that could not be opened until the
[39:06] seventh angel's message
[39:08] brother brown said the third poll is
[39:10] this is revelation 10 is the third pole
[39:13] it's the message of the seventh angel
[39:15] and the message of the seventh angel was
[39:17] the seventh seal
[39:18] you say brother david it's the secret
[39:20] that's exactly right
[39:22] it's opened in secret
[39:26] amen are you with me these things sound
[39:28] foreign but if you've been in the word
[39:30] it's not a foreign thing to you and the
[39:31] thing is you better start feeding on the
[39:33] word or you're missing
[39:35] the going home of the bride
[39:38] because we have a bride coming of christ
[39:40] taking place right now and that's the
[39:41] fulfillment of the scriptures of the
[39:43] whole revelation of jesus christ
[39:46] taking place
[39:47] and it climaxes in a body change and
[39:49] that moves right from there into a
[39:51] millennium
[39:52] we are taken
[39:54] amen
[39:57] there's got to be something to transform
[39:59] this bride there's got to be something
[40:01] in her
[40:03] that brings forth that son
[40:05] because he promised he would come
[40:07] through the woman
[40:10] hello
[40:14] you say what mary more than mary it's
[40:16] the bride in the end time
[40:18] amen
[40:19] amen
[40:22] hallelujah because it's him again it's
[40:25] the seed again
[40:27] it's bride time it's the bride time of
[40:29] that seed that full seed has to come to
[40:31] manifestation
[40:34] let me get through this message a lot
[40:35] faster you know my printer stopped
[40:36] working i can hardly read what i got on
[40:38] notes
[40:40] i told i told her i was really tore up
[40:42] in my spirit but i thanked the lord i
[40:44] had ruth and
[40:45] diane pray for me coming down the road
[40:47] and brother prayed for me and i just the
[40:49] holy spirit just dropped just a few
[40:50] moments ago prayer it just dropped
[40:54] all is well
[40:56] i may never touch my notes but i'm going
[40:57] to speak my heart
[40:59] i can back it up what the prophet said i
[41:01] can back it up in the word
[41:04] and we know i got a picture right
[41:06] this thing's been unfolding all the way
[41:08] from genesis brother sister the seventh
[41:10] seal is no new thing it just hid but
[41:12] he's gradually unfolded it down through
[41:14] the ages he was unfolding it until it's
[41:16] capstoned right here in the day in our
[41:18] hour and it's amazing to us but the caps
[41:21] known as christ
[41:23] but what form is he in today
[41:26] is what fools the people
[41:28] and he's manifested himself and he's
[41:31] done that for a purpose so we could meet
[41:33] him physically
[41:36] in a rapture
[41:38] we'll see him how many know we're going
[41:40] to see him in a body caught up in the
[41:41] air to meet him but before that time
[41:43] there's a union takes place
[41:46] she has to the bride has to conceive
[41:48] that life
[41:52] amen that's exactly it's our spirit see
[41:54] there's natural spiritual all the way
[41:56] through this brother bam said it was a
[41:58] natural bride
[41:59] a natural see and then a spiritual
[42:03] which is greater the natural or the
[42:04] spiritual
[42:07] that's the real
[42:10] that brings about a natural change a
[42:12] supernatural change in a natural body
[42:17] amen all right
[42:19] now let's i just want to get too closer
[42:21] ahead of myself but
[42:22] in the bride alone
[42:24] you might as well just get that in your
[42:25] heart right now this secret mystery that
[42:28] god has unveiled to us in this day is
[42:30] only known to the bride
[42:32] you say well you know who it is no i
[42:34] don't but i know i'm one of them
[42:39] because i have the promised
[42:40] identification of this hour seeing it
[42:42] not only revealed but lived through me
[42:45] amen
[42:48] it's not it's more than just an
[42:49] anointing brother sister it's the word
[42:51] himself unveiled in your soul
[42:57] many can be anointed we already said
[42:59] that you know that can be anointed cast
[43:00] out devils speak in tongues prophesy
[43:02] shout
[43:03] and never see the word for the season
[43:08] that's right that's anointed one's the
[43:10] end time you know that
[43:12] false anointed their anointing is the
[43:14] holy spirit but they're faults on the
[43:15] inside
[43:17] they're trying to produce something
[43:18] that's outside of the word
[43:20] that's right oh they're doing great
[43:22] things they're doing good works and they
[43:24] shout and they prophesy but they'll
[43:25] never see the word promised for the
[43:27] season and never be able to live that
[43:29] word
[43:34] and when we try to we try to do anything
[43:37] through a see see our warfare is not
[43:39] carnal it's not intellectually taught
[43:42] you don't deliver people by intellectual
[43:44] talk things
[43:45] it comes through the word
[43:47] because our warfare is not carnal but
[43:49] mighty through god to the pulling down
[43:51] of strongholds
[43:52] bringing every thought in our spirit
[43:54] realm
[43:55] it isn't it isn't the it isn't the
[43:58] product of a man's mind his teaching
[44:00] that brings deliverance in our spirit
[44:02] it's the word
[44:04] and you try to do it any other way
[44:06] you're going contrary to the word
[44:11] because you're trying to produce
[44:12] something to a carnal learning
[44:14] that will never produce life and never
[44:16] produce the truth
[44:18] so you might as well get away from that
[44:20] and start feeding on life and get into
[44:22] an open book and start feeding on that
[44:24] open word and let your psychology go
[44:32] amen that was free
[44:35] all right
[44:36] i want to bring something here
[44:38] brother brown says on the first first
[44:40] seal paragraph 43 i think 3 20 63 is the
[44:43] first either first or second seal
[44:46] but it's 3 20 63
[44:48] and when he takes this oath
[44:51] seven thunders utter their voices
[44:54] and when john was taken up was supposed
[44:56] to write what he saw and he started to
[44:57] write it down and said don't write it
[44:59] don't write that he said seal it up
[45:04] something was uttered brother brahms
[45:06] they didn't utter for nothing
[45:08] it's got to happen
[45:10] but he said you seal it up even daniel
[45:13] seal the words in the book daniel they
[45:15] cannot be open till the time of the end
[45:17] the words in the book and the prophet
[45:19] said this little bride today happens to
[45:20] be the words in the book
[45:25] amen
[45:26] and so and so he said and he said don't
[45:29] write it seal it up and then brother
[45:30] branham said what in
[45:35] seal it up what in
[45:39] now we know the bible said when these
[45:40] things were these things were done they
[45:42] were sealed up but they were sealed up
[45:44] where
[45:45] in earth and vessels
[45:49] amen that's exactly where the seal
[45:51] that's what sealed it it couldn't be
[45:53] opened
[45:54] see all them preached paul preached laid
[45:56] the foundation brother said i preached
[45:58] what paul preached but you know paul
[46:00] didn't have the revelation of these
[46:01] seven thunders
[46:03] he wrote about it
[46:05] but it's still to be unfold it's not out
[46:07] of the words why i'm trying it's in the
[46:08] word brother madam says this is not
[46:10] something out of the word it's hid in
[46:12] the word it's been hid it's been hidden
[46:14] god's back part of his mind and could
[46:16] not be revealed what was in the back
[46:18] part and purpose he had the full purpose
[46:21] until the angel's seventh angel's
[46:23] message
[46:27] amen so see without us they can't be
[46:29] made perfect
[46:32] because the full revelation of the word
[46:34] never came
[46:35] until the seventh angel's message
[46:38] because there was saying sealed up in
[46:40] fact john never wrote it the book of
[46:42] revelations wasn't even written
[46:44] yet when they were here in the first
[46:45] sages
[46:47] it was written by john that they had it
[46:49] writing in the ages but paul never had
[46:51] that writing of john
[46:52] never had the book yet
[46:56] amen what's the seal sealing the book of
[46:58] redemption the full redemption the full
[47:01] redemption
[47:03] revelation
[47:04] of jesus christ
[47:07] and if you'll ever get a hold of who you
[47:09] are it'll change your thinking and
[47:11] you'll let go of the things of this
[47:12] world
[47:17] amen
[47:18] all right
[47:20] so he
[47:22] so he said he took they said what in
[47:24] seal it up seal it up don't say it it's
[47:27] to be revealed don't say it it's to be
[47:29] revealed
[47:33] and he says now we stand justified in
[47:36] christ before him you know what
[47:37] justified means declared righteous we
[47:39] stand declared righteous before christ
[47:43] before him because he cannot pass
[47:44] judgment for he's already judged that
[47:46] body which i am a part of
[47:50] amen what part of the body am i
[47:53] christ's own body
[47:56] i'm not talking about physical i'm
[47:57] talking about the mystical body of jesus
[47:59] christ the word living
[48:02] amen it's manifest in human bodies yes
[48:05] when he comes in and identifies it he
[48:07] owns this body
[48:10] that's right it is all right so then the
[48:13] blood purchased that
[48:16] all right so then here we are we're
[48:18] justified in christ before him because
[48:19] he cannot pass judgment for it he's
[48:21] already judged that body which i'm a
[48:23] part of what he said how am i a part of
[48:26] it here it is it's in me
[48:31] he said here it is it's in me
[48:34] he said seal it up don't say it
[48:37] it's to be revealed
[48:40] now where is it it's in me
[48:43] where was the capstone
[48:45] brother bam said it was in the pyramid
[48:48] sealed
[48:53] amen i i got that quote right here i can
[48:56] anybody wonders where i where i'm
[48:57] getting these ideas we can tell you
[49:00] all right so it's not it's not some
[49:02] intellectual that sounds like a good
[49:03] quote i'll plug it here it's the
[49:05] inspiration of the holy spirit to take
[49:07] this over here put this over here it
[49:09] brings us over here and it's the picture
[49:12] and it flows right with the word
[49:16] amen so
[49:18] so he said see it's in me
[49:20] he said
[49:22] what how am i part of it it's in me see
[49:24] he said it's in me he said if you abide
[49:26] in me
[49:27] and my word in you you know what the
[49:30] prophet followed that in the message
[49:31] perfect faith then he said you know who
[49:33] you are
[49:35] if you abide in me and my word in you
[49:40] then you know who you are it's always
[49:42] the soul that controls the spirit that's
[49:44] why i said you can't control it any
[49:46] other way you're gonna be what you are
[49:48] in your spirit and you try to change
[49:50] that spirit another way brother paul
[49:53] said you bring your spirit under
[49:54] obedience every thought that's a spirit
[49:56] realm at your emotion realm you bring
[49:59] every spirit under obedience to the word
[50:02] and you try to bring it under obedience
[50:03] to something else what are you doing
[50:05] going contrary to the word
[50:09] these things our warfare is not carnal
[50:12] man's ideas man's thinking man's
[50:14] learning you don't learn it
[50:18] amen and the soul controls the body so
[50:20] what are we trying to control the spirit
[50:22] with something else outside of what's in
[50:24] that soul then get the soul changed and
[50:26] it'll control the spirit and the spirit
[50:29] will control the body then you're gonna
[50:30] see the word made manifest in flesh
[50:33] your deliverance doesn't lay in man's
[50:36] thinking it lays in the word
[50:40] amen
[50:43] the devil is subtle
[50:46] he'll make things look so reasonable but
[50:48] it was reasoning that made it fall
[50:50] you're biting off of the tree
[50:55] amen
[50:57] don't let that dominating female spirit
[51:00] govern you
[51:05] that's absolutely right you see that
[51:07] offended me i'm sorry it's be offended
[51:09] i'm i have to say some things here it
[51:11] may have very well offend you
[51:14] but look to the word
[51:16] that dominating female is a is a
[51:18] dominating spirit of denominationalism
[51:21] will always go back to the carnal it'll
[51:23] know the word carnally it can say the
[51:25] word carnally that has no revelation of
[51:27] the hour and the time
[51:30] so always revert back to man
[51:35] amen i don't know why i'm i don't i'm
[51:37] saying this wasn't in my notes at all
[51:41] amen
[51:43] all right
[51:44] here it is it's in me he said it's in me
[51:47] if he abide in me he goes right back to
[51:48] scripture if you abide in me and my word
[51:50] in you
[51:52] identified then you're identified oh he
[51:55] says oh the devil is howling about this
[51:58] i've heard him howl pretty loud today
[52:01] and yesterday and the day before coming
[52:03] up to this message
[52:05] he hates this
[52:07] the carl the carnal man the carnal
[52:09] thinking the carnal mind hates it too
[52:12] because it's out of your ordinary
[52:14] thinking and reasoning it's up in the
[52:16] realms above this realm
[52:20] it's in revelation
[52:22] any revelation that hasn't been
[52:24] vindicated by the word is the wrong
[52:26] revelation everybody's got their
[52:28] revelation but if the revelation is not
[52:29] vindicated by the word and god
[52:31] identifies it through the word it's the
[52:33] wrong revelation but when your
[52:35] revelation comes that god immediately
[52:36] takes you right back to the word right
[52:38] back to what the prophet said and there
[52:40] it is and there it is and there it is
[52:41] and there it is
[52:46] now you're seeing your picture right
[52:50] that's the truth
[52:52] all right
[52:53] we have a perfect interpretation of the
[52:55] word and don't you think for a minute
[52:56] god's word comes to his prophets
[52:59] don't you let anything belittle you in
[53:00] thinking that that's not absolute
[53:09] that word was put in his hand
[53:11] what are we going to do with it
[53:13] dominating female spirit will come in
[53:17] i didn't come to preach that sermon but
[53:18] i got it to preach
[53:20] lord willing sometime
[53:23] it's a denominational spirit of
[53:24] nicolaitanism
[53:26] balaamism it's idolatry and god hates it
[53:31] it's the seeds of the catholic church
[53:35] and it tries to worm itself right among
[53:37] the message
[53:44] a lot could be said right there but i'll
[53:46] just hold that back
[53:48] he said that's what the devil's howling
[53:50] about this the manifested truth of the
[53:53] promise of the word in her alone listen
[53:55] to me again identified he said the
[53:57] devil's howling about this the
[53:59] manifested truth of the promised word in
[54:02] her alone
[54:07] that's what he howls against that's what
[54:08] all the hell is against because jesus
[54:11] said i'll build my church upon the
[54:13] revelation of myself then what will it
[54:15] come when it comes to the building when
[54:17] it's the building is completed the
[54:19] revelation of the word was the
[54:20] completion of the building
[54:22] it'll be the capping off time
[54:25] what would it be it would have to be
[54:27] himself
[54:29] in bright form
[54:33] amen
[54:35] the devil don't want this he just say oh
[54:37] that that's just some far out kind of
[54:39] idea you call it far out if you want but
[54:42] it's so far out it's out of the carnal
[54:43] thinking
[54:47] amen it's in the word his own thinking
[54:54] and his church stands alone
[54:59] she's not hooked up with nothing she's
[55:02] not hooked up with nothing i'll say it
[55:04] again be careful what you're hooked up
[55:06] with she's not hooked up with nothing
[55:11] to her it's the word that settles it
[55:14] right
[55:15] she doesn't have to take some carnal
[55:17] idea some carnal thinking some reasoning
[55:19] and learning of man to bring forth a
[55:21] producer something to give deliverance
[55:23] it's the word that gives the deliverance
[55:25] and it's in your mouth
[55:27] don't you let the devil reason you out
[55:29] of that
[55:31] i'm you'd
[55:32] well i won't say any more about it that
[55:34] part
[55:35] let's say time to wake up but
[55:37] she'll wake up
[55:40] men time to take care of controller of
[55:41] your families
[55:43] bring them under the headship of the
[55:44] word
[55:48] i hope you
[55:49] hope you know the unwritten spoke
[55:51] unspoken word there now
[55:55] he said brother david you keep preaching
[55:57] like that nobody's going to want to hear
[55:58] you it's all right
[56:00] but i come to preach it
[56:03] i love it and i know god loves it
[56:07] don't have to look and say well i don't
[56:08] like the way you preach
[56:10] they didn't like the way john preached
[56:12] either and they didn't like the way
[56:13] jesus looked on with anger and braided
[56:15] ropes either and they don't like any of
[56:17] the preachers either they didn't like
[56:19] elijah either
[56:20] you're the troublemaker
[56:23] or paul or any of them brother branham
[56:25] called him a high-tempered jew
[56:29] i'm sure he lost a lot of that high
[56:30] temper but i'll tell you what if he was
[56:32] the preaching he didn't preach with just
[56:34] little
[56:34] theories
[56:37] he told them the truth
[56:42] do you believe the word
[56:45] are you willing to follow the word
[56:48] then take communion
[56:54] yeah you say brother david you shouldn't
[56:56] preach like that i'm telling you you
[56:58] claim to be a believer in fellowship
[56:59] with this word why aren't you partaking
[57:01] of what god said in his commandments
[57:04] three things he said to command for you
[57:06] to do
[57:07] foot washing communion
[57:11] baptism
[57:13] water baptism
[57:15] and until you do that you have not come
[57:18] under the full obedience to the word
[57:21] and you can't take that communion unless
[57:23] you're in fellowship with him so it's
[57:25] showing you up if you won't take it you
[57:27] have no part with him
[57:30] and if you take it unworthily then you
[57:32] did you're you're bringing damnation
[57:34] upon yourself
[57:36] you've got to have the token
[57:39] you've got to have the holy ghost
[57:45] amen
[57:46] i don't like your preaching well that's
[57:48] all right pray for me i'll pray for you
[57:53] but that's the truth
[57:57] if you don't believe it go to communion
[57:58] 1965 go to the other communion see what
[58:01] he said
[58:02] you're coming there because it's a
[58:04] divine revelation that you're a part of
[58:06] him and you're a part of one another
[58:08] and you're in fellowship with him
[58:12] and you say you're a believer of this
[58:14] message he won't line up with the word
[58:15] what kind of belief do you have
[58:23] well i was taught another way then
[58:24] you're listening to a false teacher
[58:28] because paul didn't preach it neither
[58:30] did brother brown preach that
[58:32] this due in remembrance of me
[58:34] till i partake with you anew at the
[58:36] wedding supper
[58:50] i didn't know it would come like this
[58:52] god knows brother sister i maybe not get
[58:55] to this message i just i don't know god
[58:57] just keeps bringing me back around
[59:00] line up with the word
[59:02] it's this this is rapture time
[59:06] what if it's too late
[59:08] what if the door's already shut
[59:10] but if you have that tug in your heart
[59:11] for more of god you better run as quick
[59:13] as you can into his presence
[59:16] and start feeding on life instead of
[59:18] books
[59:23] that's right
[59:24] i'm talking about other books
[59:28] the one book we ought to feed on was
[59:29] sealed with seven seals
[59:34] why don't you find out what he said
[59:36] because you've got your mind on other
[59:38] things that take importance over going
[59:41] home
[59:43] going in a rapture
[59:48] it's idolatrous it's an idolatrous
[59:50] spirit that would take place position
[59:52] you anything above him
[59:55] that's the truth
[1:00:01] i know i know it's hard preaching isn't
[1:00:03] it
[1:00:04] it's hard preaching
[1:00:06] some even go to sleep while i'm
[1:00:07] preaching
[1:00:10] i'm going to preach it anyway
[1:00:13] because it's going on record i have to
[1:00:14] answer it someday
[1:00:18] and i don't want to i don't want you to
[1:00:20] point your pointy finger at me and tell
[1:00:22] me you didn't tell me the truth
[1:00:24] because someday i'm going to stand there
[1:00:26] with those words before you again
[1:00:32] i want to give witness to that yes lord
[1:00:33] i was the one that said that that's what
[1:00:36] they heard
[1:00:43] we're just not here to play around we
[1:00:45] don't play church we don't come because
[1:00:47] everyone people are going to think of us
[1:00:49] if we don't come to church
[1:00:54] it's a love affair
[1:00:58] all right
[1:00:59] and the howling devils howling because
[1:01:01] it's being revealed
[1:01:05] this is what he's saying he said and
[1:01:06] this church stands alone she's not
[1:01:08] touched with anything
[1:01:11] he was identified by god being the body
[1:01:13] that god dwelled in and the church is
[1:01:15] identified by
[1:01:16] his body doing the same thing
[1:01:20] doing the same thing
[1:01:22] she is his body
[1:01:25] whoa
[1:01:26] she is his body
[1:01:29] she's him
[1:01:32] she's him brother sister she's him
[1:01:35] it's not some little off something thing
[1:01:36] here he said
[1:01:38] he said
[1:01:42] the bible is the complete revelation of
[1:01:44] jesus christ he said see
[1:01:46] it is
[1:01:47] his body
[1:01:52] what's the bride
[1:01:55] his body
[1:01:58] the complete revelation
[1:02:00] of him
[1:02:03] okay i haven't got to my scriptures yet
[1:02:04] this all come out a little bit
[1:02:06] quicker
[1:02:07] let's just keep moving
[1:02:09] because that these scriptures will bring
[1:02:11] it out
[1:02:12] haven't you read the scriptures yet
[1:02:14] isn't that something
[1:02:16] oh you're out of order
[1:02:20] all right
[1:02:21] [Music]
[1:02:23] the last day
[1:02:25] she alone stands by it
[1:02:28] amen
[1:02:29] she stands by it
[1:02:33] and this great organizations are set up
[1:02:35] to close her up she'll never be closed
[1:02:37] up she'll be taken up
[1:02:42] amen
[1:02:43] she is now risen by the power of the
[1:02:45] vindicated word promised to her she has
[1:02:47] now risen
[1:02:49] by the power of the vindicated word
[1:02:51] promised to her
[1:02:53] what a resurrection that was
[1:02:55] and what a resurrection this is
[1:02:58] i personally have raised from death to
[1:03:03] life
[1:03:05] it's already begun working what a
[1:03:06] resurrection this is
[1:03:10] amen amen amen
[1:03:13] all right
[1:03:15] how the bible holds that promise he told
[1:03:18] me he would return after me i believe it
[1:03:23] do you believe it
[1:03:26] amen
[1:03:29] we ought to lay in the word of it
[1:03:33] because he himself stepped forth and
[1:03:35] took the book
[1:03:39] hello
[1:03:40] who opened it
[1:03:44] a lion
[1:03:45] when he turned around he saw the lamb
[1:03:47] that was worthy to open it
[1:03:51] but his thunder and roar was god
[1:03:53] speaking out
[1:03:55] and when he
[1:03:56] did seven thunders uttered their voices
[1:04:02] what were those seven thunders the
[1:04:04] mysteries contained the revelation
[1:04:07] contained
[1:04:08] in the seals
[1:04:13] and that book contained names
[1:04:18] amen
[1:04:19] and those names had to be revealed
[1:04:22] claimed because he redeemed them
[1:04:25] but unless the book was opened unless
[1:04:26] the title deed was open no one would
[1:04:28] know what they owned and and what he
[1:04:30] didn't come to claim what he owned it
[1:04:32] would have been lost
[1:04:35] are you with me
[1:04:39] you don't realize what a great thing
[1:04:40] god's done in this day
[1:04:42] and we're a part of you say how many
[1:04:44] years down the line because we had to
[1:04:45] lay in the presence of the sun to ripen
[1:04:50] how can there be a marriage if the sun
[1:04:52] hasn't come
[1:04:57] amen
[1:04:59] we gotta lay in his presence
[1:05:03] to ripen
[1:05:05] to take the greenness out of us get all
[1:05:07] this denominational thinking and ideas
[1:05:09] out of our mind
[1:05:13] amen
[1:05:15] well i think well i think well i think
[1:05:17] god tell us what he thought and we don't
[1:05:19] have a free thought coming
[1:05:23] somebody can turn their phone off
[1:05:27] all right
[1:05:28] god bless you
[1:05:30] you just forgot like we all do
[1:05:33] okay
[1:05:35] praise the lord
[1:05:39] don't interpret that alex
[1:05:42] okay
[1:05:47] that's all it was
[1:05:49] okay no no no no i don't mean that to be
[1:05:52] harmful or hurtful as i said we all
[1:05:54] forget it
[1:05:58] i'm telling you
[1:06:05] well i say that they'll probably
[1:06:07] misunderstand so
[1:06:09] all right
[1:06:10] see christ
[1:06:12] that's it christ the word he was the
[1:06:15] word he's the word and the church
[1:06:16] becomes a word by making him a part of
[1:06:18] him making her excuse me a part of him
[1:06:21] and that's the word again personally
[1:06:23] identified by him his property alone his
[1:06:25] property alone she is redeemed by him
[1:06:29] and for him
[1:06:31] amen
[1:06:33] that's what the devil's howling about
[1:06:35] it's being revealed
[1:06:39] turn with me to matthew
[1:06:42] 24.
[1:06:44] i'd like you to stand with me and i'll
[1:06:45] read this one scripture
[1:06:48] now we're just getting started with this
[1:06:49] service those that are taping it
[1:06:54] that was a prelude
[1:06:57] you heard the beautiful music hear the
[1:07:00] songs
[1:07:04] amen
[1:07:05] are you ready for the word i've given
[1:07:07] you a word already but i'm
[1:07:10] matthew 24 verse 3 starting
[1:07:16] i want to refer back to what brother
[1:07:18] branham preached in 1962 12 62 9 12 30 i
[1:07:22] believe it was
[1:07:23] is this the sign of the end sir
[1:07:28] question
[1:07:30] sir asking god
[1:07:32] remember how he's questioning god what
[1:07:33] is this what is this
[1:07:35] is this a furthering of my ministry does
[1:07:37] this mean i'm going what is this
[1:07:40] he said is this the sign now remember
[1:07:45] they asked jesus three questions
[1:07:49] the last questions matthew 24 3 is that
[1:07:52] now verse 3 it says he sat upon as he
[1:07:54] sat upon the mount of olives the
[1:07:56] disciples came unto him privately saying
[1:07:59] tell us when shall these things be and
[1:08:02] what should the things be other words
[1:08:03] the temple the
[1:08:05] the destruction of the temple
[1:08:07] he said when will these things be and
[1:08:10] what shall be the sign
[1:08:11] of thy coming and
[1:08:15] and the sign
[1:08:18] of the end of the world
[1:08:21] are you following me
[1:08:23] okay brother brown preached a message
[1:08:25] called sirs
[1:08:28] is this this excuse me he said he titled
[1:08:31] different things in there but but in the
[1:08:33] in the book and the way he titled it was
[1:08:35] this is this the sign of the end sir
[1:08:42] amen brother branham made it very clear
[1:08:44] the sign of the end was the opening of
[1:08:46] the seventh seal
[1:08:49] he said the reason those seals when they
[1:08:51] opened up and that seventh opened it
[1:08:53] showed us we have arrived
[1:08:56] we have arrived this is the end
[1:09:00] now in the end we've been here 50 years
[1:09:02] what i'm saying the end meaning it was
[1:09:03] done right then but this is the time
[1:09:06] what is the sign of the end
[1:09:09] and he told us what it was
[1:09:12] and he said we have arrived and that's
[1:09:15] after those denominations denominate and
[1:09:17] the life leaves the shuck and they put
[1:09:19] the word out
[1:09:22] then the seals are opened up
[1:09:24] seven thunders utter their voices to
[1:09:26] someone
[1:09:29] and it was ordered to john and he knew
[1:09:32] it and he was the type of the bride
[1:09:35] and it was the seventh angel's message
[1:09:37] to reveal what those thunders said
[1:09:40] because that was an unwritten word in
[1:09:42] revelations 10.
[1:09:44] don't put it as an unwritten word
[1:09:45] through the whole bible because brother
[1:09:47] branham said it's been opened up by god
[1:09:49] gradually all the way through the bible
[1:09:52] he'd been letting his mystery that he
[1:09:54] had in the back part of his mind opened
[1:09:56] up
[1:09:57] but he said we couldn't see it until the
[1:09:59] seventh angel's message because he being
[1:10:01] a prophet came with the revelation of it
[1:10:06] it took a prophet to reveal it do you
[1:10:08] understand what i'm saying he played the
[1:10:09] part he had to have the book and brother
[1:10:12] braham said that the the lamb stepped
[1:10:14] forth and put it in the hand of his
[1:10:15] seventh angel to give it to the people
[1:10:20] oh
[1:10:21] oh then then who where'd we see the lamb
[1:10:24] he was already showing the sign who was
[1:10:27] it the revealing of the son of man
[1:10:30] making himself known and he said but i'm
[1:10:32] going to return to you in the time of
[1:10:34] life
[1:10:36] the word will come to you again
[1:10:40] amen
[1:10:43] see we have the day of sodom is that
[1:10:45] right that was to be at the end time
[1:10:48] all right then we see what he said there
[1:10:50] turn to matthew 24
[1:10:53] or matthew shoot me again 24 and verse
[1:10:55] 27.
[1:10:58] for as the lightning cometh out of the
[1:11:00] east and shineth even unto the west so
[1:11:03] also shall the coming of the son of man
[1:11:05] be he's coming unveiling his word from
[1:11:07] east to west
[1:11:10] are you with me it rises in the east
[1:11:12] sets in the west
[1:11:15] and and and remember he said now he said
[1:11:19] being that that see we have that setting
[1:11:22] all right
[1:11:23] all right i mean that's setting in time
[1:11:25] then he says for wheresoever the
[1:11:27] carcasses are the body word of the son
[1:11:29] of man
[1:11:31] he said you're not feeding on a man
[1:11:33] you're feeding on the body word of the
[1:11:35] son of man he said he said wheresoever
[1:11:37] the carcasses there will the eagles be
[1:11:39] gathered together
[1:11:41] you want to know where the eagles are
[1:11:43] that's where they are they're not in
[1:11:44] this church and that church they're
[1:11:46] spread around the world but they're
[1:11:48] together under one headship they're
[1:11:50] together under one feeding they're
[1:11:51] together under the promised word of the
[1:11:53] hour
[1:11:55] and it's the revelation that unites them
[1:11:57] together
[1:11:58] they will be together someday
[1:12:00] but they're together now because they're
[1:12:02] all in christ
[1:12:05] amen
[1:12:06] amen all right so there will the eagles
[1:12:09] be gathered together wherever that
[1:12:11] message of the third pull is they're
[1:12:14] going to be feeding on that open book
[1:12:21] that's the body word
[1:12:25] fresh manna in due season
[1:12:29] spiritual food in due season i don't
[1:12:32] care how much of a of a famine is out
[1:12:34] here and how much this is going on
[1:12:35] that's going on we have spiritual food
[1:12:38] in due season
[1:12:43] all right
[1:12:45] now
[1:12:46] he said
[1:12:47] immediately after now he goes right
[1:12:49] immediately after the tribulation of
[1:12:51] those days so the shun be done what
[1:12:53] tribulation
[1:12:55] he identified it he identified and
[1:12:57] remember he's speaking to israel here
[1:13:00] he's speaking to his disciples is that
[1:13:02] right but in this we gather our time of
[1:13:04] where we're at
[1:13:06] he's speaking to israel here and he's
[1:13:08] telling immediately after the
[1:13:09] tribulation of those days what days
[1:13:11] eichmann hitler
[1:13:14] brother man called it a
[1:13:16] pre-tribulation on them is that right
[1:13:20] people gave their life they were
[1:13:21] slaughtered they were wounded they were
[1:13:23] killed everything is that right okay and
[1:13:26] he said and and then all the tribes of
[1:13:28] the earth shall mourn
[1:13:30] excuse me as medially after the
[1:13:31] tribulation of the day shall the sun be
[1:13:33] darkened the moon shall not give her
[1:13:35] light the stars shall fall from heaven
[1:13:37] and the powers of heaven shall be shaken
[1:13:39] so we see then something is moving in
[1:13:41] this time
[1:13:43] and here in the same time here comes a
[1:13:46] message here comes a messenger out of
[1:13:49] the of of the pentecostal move
[1:13:52] hidden way back in there
[1:13:54] coming up through that is that right
[1:13:58] the seventh messenger
[1:14:01] and the same time these things just
[1:14:03] after their finish
[1:14:06] then he comes now watch and then see
[1:14:08] because it's not only pertaining to
[1:14:10] israel but the gentiles are in this
[1:14:12] involved
[1:14:14] in the scriptures here
[1:14:16] and then shall appear the sign of the
[1:14:18] son of man in heaven oh
[1:14:20] wonder what we saw
[1:14:23] wonder if we've seen the sign of the son
[1:14:25] of man the appearing what is that cloud
[1:14:27] ring on mount sunset it's a fulfilling
[1:14:30] of scriptures the prophet said it's a
[1:14:32] fulfilling of the word
[1:14:34] who is it we saw
[1:14:37] his picture was taken
[1:14:39] amen
[1:14:43] where was who was that our head or
[1:14:45] wasn't it
[1:14:50] uh-huh he had to go up in that
[1:14:52] consolation to get the revelation of
[1:14:54] that seventh seal and come back and tell
[1:14:56] us
[1:15:00] all right are you with me
[1:15:02] so who is it speaking
[1:15:06] our lord up there quickening power lets
[1:15:09] us see his coming
[1:15:12] the mystery of the seven seals the
[1:15:14] mystery of his coming
[1:15:17] absolutely doesn't all the alcohol is
[1:15:19] coming is it out there when we meet him
[1:15:21] in the air
[1:15:23] it happens to be his coming is going on
[1:15:25] right now
[1:15:28] because there had to be a fulfillment of
[1:15:30] scripture and he had to come to produce
[1:15:32] it and that's the bride coming of christ
[1:15:35] out of dark denomination a rapture out
[1:15:38] of that we had a first maturity son come
[1:15:41] to maturity full manifestation showing
[1:15:44] the others would come
[1:15:50] amen there had to be in order to fulfill
[1:15:53] the mystery in order for those sealed
[1:15:55] what spocial said there had to be a
[1:15:58] fulfillment of genesis again for the
[1:16:01] millennium
[1:16:06] as you can go back and find right in
[1:16:08] genesis
[1:16:09] the seventh seal
[1:16:12] mystery and we'll refer to that brother
[1:16:15] brown refers to it often over and over
[1:16:19] amen
[1:16:21] and he plays that whole thing right out
[1:16:24] because god had a heart purpose
[1:16:26] he has a full purpose that he wants to
[1:16:28] achieve and he said i'm going to hold it
[1:16:31] i'm going to withhold it because if i
[1:16:32] reveal that to john then it'll all be
[1:16:34] messed up my plan
[1:16:36] satan will get a hold of it but if i do
[1:16:38] it at the end there's no way he can get
[1:16:40] a hold of it too late
[1:16:46] we don't realize what kind of people
[1:16:47] we're privileged people to be here in
[1:16:49] this hour to be a witness to be a true
[1:16:51] witness to be a true manifestation we
[1:16:54] are his thought manifested god when he
[1:16:56] spoke this message he revealed those in
[1:16:59] the book
[1:17:02] that revelation in there was the
[1:17:04] revelation of god in flesh in bride form
[1:17:08] and he revealed every name that was in
[1:17:10] that book
[1:17:11] is your name there
[1:17:13] you know it because that mystery is
[1:17:15] revealed to you personally
[1:17:18] that's what the devil's howling about
[1:17:21] hallelujah amen
[1:17:23] it's being revealed
[1:17:25] being opened it's been open
[1:17:27] and as she feeds on it it comes closer
[1:17:29] and closer what is it what's happening
[1:17:31] she's taking a rapture
[1:17:33] moving towards that fi she's marching
[1:17:35] right in step with the word
[1:17:37] not going down going up
[1:17:40] just like enoch one step at a time was
[1:17:42] in the light he just kept rising higher
[1:17:43] and higher
[1:17:44] and that's what's happening to you i
[1:17:46] wonder if you could tell me are you
[1:17:47] rising higher and higher
[1:17:49] what's happening to you day by day is
[1:17:51] his mercies new to you every morning
[1:17:53] great is his faithfulness is the word
[1:17:55] continued to open up i never saw that
[1:17:57] before
[1:17:58] there it is
[1:18:03] all right 27 where am i 30 29 oh
[1:18:07] 20.
[1:18:10] oh
[1:18:12] oh
[1:18:14] i'm off my there i got to turn a page
[1:18:16] all right and then shall appear the sign
[1:18:18] of the son of man in heaven and then
[1:18:20] shall all the tribes of the earth mourn
[1:18:23] why would the tribes tribes
[1:18:27] start mourning why because they're going
[1:18:29] to be brought to their day of atonement
[1:18:32] they're going to realize what they did
[1:18:35] he's revealed to them now but first
[1:18:37] there's a revealing to someone else
[1:18:40] that's the secret in that book
[1:18:45] there's a little interval right here
[1:18:47] because he reveals all six seals
[1:18:50] then between the sixth and the seventh
[1:18:52] chapter brother ram said there's
[1:18:53] something's happened
[1:18:56] and in order for her israel to get her
[1:18:59] message
[1:19:01] gentiles have to be taken out of here
[1:19:03] what produced it
[1:19:05] what produced the rapturing faith what
[1:19:07] brought it forth it lays right in the
[1:19:09] message of the seventh angel
[1:19:14] amen
[1:19:15] you see why i can't finish this today
[1:19:17] don't you i'm not even off the first
[1:19:18] page
[1:19:21] i guess it's all right me then i guess i
[1:19:23] i just have to come back for the next 10
[1:19:25] services and finish it
[1:19:28] if i'm going to break it down the only
[1:19:30] way i can
[1:19:32] amen but i'll go as far as we can what
[1:19:34] time is it oh i still got lots of time
[1:19:36] about two hours yet
[1:19:41] got you to smile anyway
[1:19:43] okay
[1:19:46] so he said
[1:19:52] i'm still i keep flipping that page for
[1:19:53] some reason all right must be the wind
[1:19:58] something supernatural
[1:20:00] i can't do it now
[1:20:01] all right
[1:20:03] and then shall all the tribes of the
[1:20:05] earth mourn they shall see the son of
[1:20:06] man coming in the clouds of heaven with
[1:20:09] power
[1:20:10] and great glory
[1:20:14] okay
[1:20:15] then and he shall send his angels too
[1:20:20] something's bypassed right here
[1:20:23] we see the six we see the fifth seal we
[1:20:25] see the sixth seal
[1:20:27] in israel receiving their message
[1:20:32] that's their seventh trumpet
[1:20:35] where's our seventh seal brother braham
[1:20:37] said the seventh seal and the seventh
[1:20:38] trumpet are the same
[1:20:40] ones to the gentiles the others to
[1:20:42] israel
[1:20:44] are you with me
[1:20:46] something something because now he's
[1:20:48] going on watch what he's saying he said
[1:20:50] then he shall send his angels with a
[1:20:52] great sound of a trumpet that's
[1:20:53] revelations 11.
[1:20:55] two witnesses
[1:20:58] what happened to the gentiles here
[1:21:03] see
[1:21:04] see with a great sound of a trumpet and
[1:21:06] they and because they're asking him
[1:21:08] questions what's the sign of your coming
[1:21:11] we've seen the sign of his coming
[1:21:15] and it's a great uniting time sign
[1:21:18] hello
[1:21:20] what about our uniting times sign
[1:21:25] it was a sign of him uniting with who
[1:21:28] his bride
[1:21:30] a marriage
[1:21:34] and they that went through their
[1:21:36] pentecost were made ready and went in
[1:21:38] with him
[1:21:39] to the wedding supper or to me went in
[1:21:41] with him to the marriage
[1:21:44] amen
[1:21:45] that right
[1:21:47] the marriage becomes before the wedding
[1:21:48] supper
[1:21:53] amen they went in
[1:21:55] been with him some were left out those
[1:21:57] that didn't have oil were left out
[1:21:59] because they couldn't see the message
[1:22:01] they thought you were just too deep
[1:22:06] hello
[1:22:08] you're just talking riddles you're too
[1:22:10] deep you know you can't cake it that
[1:22:12] deep you just need to you just need to
[1:22:14] get the holy ghost it won't be so deep
[1:22:16] it'll be too simple then
[1:22:20] that's the truth
[1:22:22] i'm not talking the riddles with you
[1:22:24] that's the truth without the holy ghost
[1:22:26] you'll never see the message of the hour
[1:22:31] you must be born again in order to be
[1:22:33] born again our pastor took that right
[1:22:36] back to the quote in church age book
[1:22:38] only the seed can be reborn
[1:22:40] only the elect
[1:22:43] you have to have that seed planted in
[1:22:45] you before the world began you who are
[1:22:46] part of him in his thinking of himself
[1:22:49] before the world began
[1:22:52] you always were alive you know that you
[1:22:55] know that you were always alive i know
[1:22:56] i'm keeping you standing but just stand
[1:22:58] a minute
[1:22:59] you know you are always alive
[1:23:02] but then you come into the world of sin
[1:23:04] and came born in a body and you were
[1:23:07] asleep
[1:23:09] to life
[1:23:12] it took something to awaken you
[1:23:16] just like awakened lazarus lazarus come
[1:23:19] forth loud voice
[1:23:22] hello
[1:23:24] said lazarus what if he said bride
[1:23:29] what if he called your name
[1:23:31] what if he called the mystery of himself
[1:23:32] which is your name what if he called
[1:23:34] that
[1:23:37] but that voice of that resurrection
[1:23:39] which is now the bride in this hour has
[1:23:42] that voice
[1:23:45] mary was the voice of that revelation in
[1:23:48] her
[1:23:51] amen
[1:23:54] and it manifested i'm not talking about
[1:23:56] having a revelation you do nothing well
[1:23:58] just go out and live the world i'd go to
[1:23:59] church and i'm fine i go out and live
[1:24:01] the world and i know where's the
[1:24:03] revelation of the word
[1:24:05] in your life where is it manifesting
[1:24:07] it's got to manifest
[1:24:10] it's not you make up and work up and
[1:24:12] pump it up it's got to manifest itself
[1:24:14] automatically because that's the
[1:24:15] characteristic of the holy spirit it'll
[1:24:17] manifest the word
[1:24:19] for the hour for the time it can't live
[1:24:22] something else
[1:24:26] amen amen amen you're gonna bear that
[1:24:28] fruit what fruit the fruit of the season
[1:24:32] when somebody comes along preaching
[1:24:33] another season another fruit you know
[1:24:36] it's not right
[1:24:38] who discerns that
[1:24:40] david dean hart with his great
[1:24:42] intellects no the word revealed in me
[1:24:45] jesus christ the same yesterday today
[1:24:48] and forever
[1:24:52] i was always him i was always a part of
[1:24:54] him i existed in the thoughts of him
[1:24:56] those thoughts of him are eternal i was
[1:24:58] eternal in him
[1:25:03] there had to be an awakening because i
[1:25:05] was deep in sleep
[1:25:07] i wasn't dead
[1:25:10] you can't be alive in eternity and now
[1:25:11] be dead that's eternal separation
[1:25:16] but you were dead in sin trespasses it
[1:25:19] hid it hid you from him you lost your
[1:25:22] position you bypassed your theophany
[1:25:27] amen
[1:25:29] amen you bypassed it but then when
[1:25:32] you're born again you begin to hear from
[1:25:33] it
[1:25:35] and it's real and it exists and it's
[1:25:37] alive and it's a living stone and
[1:25:40] it's jesus christ
[1:25:44] and it's me
[1:25:46] mama it's me
[1:25:50] i look in the mirror of this open word
[1:25:52] and i can't see another person i see who
[1:25:54] i am and he sees who he is and he is she
[1:25:58] and she is him
[1:26:06] and he said he sent his angels this is a
[1:26:09] message going to the 144 000 revelation
[1:26:12] 7
[1:26:13] revelations 11.
[1:26:18] but in between that is revelations 10.
[1:26:22] the message
[1:26:24] to the church
[1:26:26] but it opens up not to the public it
[1:26:28] opens up to secret within secret in her
[1:26:32] hid brother branham said god he said
[1:26:35] unveiling of god how could he preach a
[1:26:36] sermon like that the mighty god unveiled
[1:26:38] the unveiling of god like he just said
[1:26:41] oh the um god is just unveiled
[1:26:45] he said little children little seed you
[1:26:47] elect
[1:26:48] god's come in full view of you
[1:26:50] amen
[1:26:57] amen
[1:26:58] are you with me
[1:27:01] come full view of you hid
[1:27:05] okay i'll let you be seated in just a
[1:27:06] minute
[1:27:13] and he shall send his angels they shall
[1:27:15] gather his elect from the four winds
[1:27:17] from one end of heaven to the other that
[1:27:19] elect is elect
[1:27:21] israel
[1:27:23] not bride
[1:27:27] brother branham identified that angels
[1:27:30] as two witnesses
[1:27:33] is that right
[1:27:34] he tied that right in with two witnesses
[1:27:36] of revelation 11. angels plural with the
[1:27:39] sound of one trumpet
[1:27:41] [Laughter]
[1:27:43] amen are you with me all the trumpets
[1:27:45] sound under the sixth seal

[1:27:55] land is the sixth seal the tribulation
[1:27:57] is a sixth
[1:27:58] seal amen
[1:28:01] amen it's judgment it's a judgment seal
[1:28:04] and we see judgment striking beginning
[1:28:06] to strike how close are we to a body
[1:28:08] change
[1:28:09] because right in between here is a
[1:28:10] mystery being unveiled is a mystery
[1:28:12] being revealed it's the bride going home
[1:28:16] and the world says oh
[1:28:17] i don't get it we don't see it

[1:28:55] he showed it here and now the time
[1:28:57] showing the time of end now watch he
[1:28:59] said now when you learn the parable of a
[1:29:01] fig tree when he put when his branch is
[1:29:03] yet tender and put it forth leaves you

[1:29:33] forth their leaves brother brandon made

[1:29:39] message come right directly to the bride

[1:30:06] i got to go get her she's got to come
[1:30:08] out of that thing and she's going to be
[1:30:10] the full revelation and manifestation as
[1:30:12] it was in adam she'll be the mystery of
[1:30:14] myself
[1:30:18] and the world's going to know nothing
[1:30:19] about it churches won't know anything
[1:30:21] about it and the carnal won't know
[1:30:22] anything about it and only the elect
[1:30:25] because they're seed
[1:30:30] and when they have a new birth they'll
[1:30:32] be changed just like adam and sarah i
[1:30:35] mean abraham and sarah
[1:30:39] i didn't intently do that
[1:30:42] i just come out wrong but good adam and
[1:30:44] sarah all right abraham and
[1:30:48] sarah
[1:30:50] he had to have a name change and his
[1:30:52] name was changed
[1:30:54] because a victory had been won
[1:30:57] he had waited patiently in faith for
[1:30:59] that promise to come and he said i'm
[1:31:01] going to meet that promise
[1:31:05] and when they had their little change
[1:31:06] come over him
[1:31:08] they went down to abemelic
[1:31:10] now let me just back up you can be
[1:31:12] seated i'm not going to finish it with
[1:31:13] you standing
[1:31:15] i could
[1:31:18] now brother jason you keep us standing
[1:31:20] sometimes too so anyway
[1:31:26] i love that brother anyway he knows that
[1:31:31] and i love you all and
[1:31:33] i hope you know that
[1:31:36] i may get a little loud a little gruff
[1:31:38] but you know what
[1:31:40] god chose i'm gonna i'm just gonna send
[1:31:41] someone out there like that that's gonna
[1:31:43] it's gonna blow them away there's
[1:31:45] outward expressions
[1:31:48] and they're gonna judge me by the
[1:31:49] outward expressions and that's not what
[1:31:50] i'm judging by
[1:31:52] hello hello anybody say amen to that
[1:31:57] yourself personally
[1:32:02] okay where was i
[1:32:04] oh yes abraham and sarah
[1:32:06] i'm adamant i mean abraham and sarah
[1:32:08] all right
[1:32:11] good name adam
[1:32:13] you're part of the mystery
[1:32:15] right from the very beginning
[1:32:19] there was a second adam muddiner
[1:32:22] and something came out and something
[1:32:24] came out of that bride right there
[1:32:26] that met the met the requirement of the
[1:32:28] day
[1:32:30] she he had to come because satan got to
[1:32:34] eve first
[1:32:35] before adam did
[1:32:37] the natural woman
[1:32:38] and corrupted her seduced her by
[1:32:41] reasoning you see why the bible says you
[1:32:44] stay away from reasoning you start
[1:32:46] taking this word and let the word start
[1:32:47] judging your life and start ruling your
[1:32:49] wife and your life and your wife and
[1:32:52] your home
[1:32:57] with the word
[1:33:00] she wasn't made to be the head of your
[1:33:01] house
[1:33:05] amen takes discernment takes the holy
[1:33:07] ghost to tell the difference
[1:33:10] amen
[1:33:11] all right
[1:33:12] because you're commanded to keep your
[1:33:13] home in order
[1:33:18] that devil's so subtle
[1:33:20] i'm back on it again aren't i the devil
[1:33:22] is so subtle you'll come in such
[1:33:24] reasoning it looks wonderful it looks
[1:33:26] right
[1:33:29] silly women laden with divers lust and
[1:33:31] ever learning and never able to come to
[1:33:33] the knowledge of the truth
[1:33:36] from such turn away

[1:36:24] would loose
[1:36:27] is this is this it sirs
[1:36:33] jesus said himself the man he said i
[1:36:35] don't know only the father knows when
[1:36:37] this is going to take place
[1:36:42] brother braham said notice when jesus
[1:36:44] turned to the seventh seal it was a
[1:36:47] secret
[1:36:49] and when he revealed it under the
[1:36:50] seventh seal when he spoke it it was
[1:36:53] still a secret
[1:36:55] but he said it will be revealed as they
[1:36:56] have need of knowing it

[1:37:44] it's not a shut seal it's an open seal

[1:38:20] something here
[1:38:22] because if i don't get to that portion
[1:38:24] you're going to leave you hanging
[1:38:32] i've got it way back in this message
[1:38:35] yeah
[1:38:36] now those seven voices never uttered for
[1:38:38] nothing
[1:38:40] brother brown said there will be seven
[1:38:41] of these thunders that will reveal the
[1:38:43] great revelation at that time
[1:38:47] a member of my mess my title is in her
[1:38:49] alone
[1:38:51] amen

[1:39:17] thunders are going to be known by
[1:39:19] somebody
[1:39:21] before the body change
[1:39:24] amen
[1:39:26] amen it's got to be revealed he said
[1:39:29] and he said he said it's revealed now
[1:39:32] watch he said he said
[1:39:34] no wonder he said it wasn't even written
[1:39:37] it written where now see it sounds like
[1:39:38] brother brahma said you won't find it
[1:39:40] written anywhere no you won't find it
[1:39:41] written
[1:39:43] in the opening of revelation 10.
[1:39:47] it wasn't written
[1:39:48] but it's in the word because brother
[1:39:50] brown said god can't do that if there's
[1:39:51] a revelation laying in there which there
[1:39:53] is because he said the seven thunders
[1:39:56] are the revelations contained in
[1:39:58] the seven seals oh you said but that
[1:40:00] won't be known yes it is known
[1:40:04] the bride's going to know it
[1:40:06] because it's opening the book it's
[1:40:07] opening the message and you're the
[1:40:09] message
[1:40:12] see it's a love affair it's coming to
[1:40:14] her personally it's individual
[1:40:16] to you
[1:40:17] it's not the groups he's gone it's not
[1:40:20] church anymore brother graham said it's
[1:40:21] not church
[1:40:22] it's the bride
[1:40:25] this is the bright age this is the
[1:40:27] raptured age
[1:40:29] this is bride time
[1:40:33] let's be glad and rejoice the marriage
[1:40:34] of the lamb has come
[1:40:39] all right
[1:40:41] so he said no wonder it's not even
[1:40:43] written he said they hushed heaven hush
[1:40:45] nothing took place angel didn't know it
[1:40:47] nobody knows when he's coming
[1:40:53] all right but it'll be revealed
[1:40:56] in those seven thunders and that will
[1:40:59] reveal that greville great revelation at
[1:41:01] that time what time when you need it
[1:41:04] brother brown said later on he said you
[1:41:06] will it'll be revealed to you
[1:41:10] amen now he didn't leave us without the
[1:41:13] message of that
[1:41:15] what do you think he preached all the
[1:41:16] way until the time of his departure
[1:41:19] was that revelation
[1:41:22] who are you bride where are you
[1:41:24] now watch watch what he said that the
[1:41:26] opening of the seals were
[1:41:29] would you like to know what he said the
[1:41:30] opening of the seals were
[1:41:34] he said he opened those seals the seven
[1:41:36] mysteries the seven-fold mystery of the
[1:41:38] bible that's been closed since the
[1:41:40] foundation of the world will be revealed
[1:41:42] and yet we yet a little humble group
[1:41:44] compared with all the world we've
[1:41:46] enjoyed those blessings of hearing the
[1:41:48] mysteries marriage divorce serpent seeds
[1:41:51] all those that little loose ends loose
[1:41:52] ends
[1:41:54] notice he could not preach marriage and
[1:41:56] divorce till after the opening of the
[1:41:57] seal who is this melchizedek could not
[1:41:59] be preached till after the opening of
[1:42:01] the seals
[1:42:02] the seed does not air with the shock
[1:42:03] could not be preached all these things
[1:42:05] christ the mystery of god revealed
[1:42:07] brother brahm said right there in that
[1:42:08] message i'm revealing to you what his
[1:42:10] coming would be
[1:42:12] how
[1:42:13] when
[1:42:14] has been sealed up and he said it's been
[1:42:16] a good thing that it has been
[1:42:19] because satan would have got it
[1:42:21] but now is the time he said for it to be
[1:42:24] revealed
[1:42:26] all right
[1:42:28] and he began to unfold it i just could
[1:42:30] spend a lot of time just on the quotes
[1:42:32] but look he said now he said
[1:42:35] he said see
[1:42:37] all these different questions has been
[1:42:39] he said has been the reason i'm leaving
[1:42:41] indiana to arizona where i was to meet
[1:42:43] in the form of a pyramid seven angels
[1:42:46] not knowing what would happen later when
[1:42:48] i got there thinking it was the end of
[1:42:49] my life that no one could stand the
[1:42:51] blast and i'm sure you all are
[1:42:52] acquainted with the story but in sabino
[1:42:54] kenya that one morning while in prayer
[1:42:56] there'd been a sword placed in my hand
[1:42:58] he said this is the word other words he
[1:43:00] said now but he said brother brahm said
[1:43:01] the word is in my hand the word is in
[1:43:03] the hand
[1:43:05] all right
[1:43:07] and he said
[1:43:08] and he said now
[1:43:10] it took they took the picture all the
[1:43:11] way from mexico i won't go into all that
[1:43:13] a mystic something in the spheres
[1:43:15] and he says and they wanted to know
[1:43:17] science one of them wanted to know any
[1:43:19] significance but he said i didn't tell
[1:43:21] them
[1:43:24] could have he said i didn't tell them
[1:43:26] he said you all it was you all knew it
[1:43:28] beforehand
[1:43:31] but it wasn't for them
[1:43:33] it was for you
[1:43:36] all right now they he said and there he
[1:43:39] spoke to me and said the seven seals
[1:43:40] will be open the seven mystery the
[1:43:42] seven-fold mystery of the bible that's
[1:43:44] been closed up since the foundation of
[1:43:46] the world will be revealed
[1:43:50] amen
[1:43:53] he said we'll be revealed and we yet a
[1:43:56] little humble group compared with the
[1:43:57] world we've enjoyed these blessings of
[1:43:59] hearing these mysteries and he said he
[1:44:01] says now
[1:44:07] and these different questions has been
[1:44:09] been answered he said now he said
[1:44:13] all these different questions has been
[1:44:15] completely revealed to us
[1:44:18] not by man
[1:44:21] but by god himself
[1:44:25] then who's unveiled here
[1:44:30] by god himself that's all he said that's
[1:44:34] that's who opened those seven mysteries
[1:44:36] of what the watch
[1:44:39] what are those seven mysteries revealing
[1:44:41] of what the church was
[1:44:43] how it was in christ at the beginning
[1:44:45] and how it would be revealed in the last
[1:44:48] day
[1:44:52] amen
[1:44:53] well you turn the picture like this you
[1:44:54] can probably see it from the audience
[1:44:56] it's christ supreme judge
[1:44:59] and it's the truth this is the truth he
[1:45:01] said it's a vindication it's an
[1:45:03] identification a perfect identification
[1:45:05] and a perfect vindication that this
[1:45:08] message is the truth
[1:45:11] if you want a vindication identification
[1:45:13] he said that's a perfect identification
[1:45:16] because what's the message him
[1:45:19] all right
[1:45:20] see
[1:45:21] him not third person the only person
[1:45:25] you're not a third person you're the
[1:45:27] only person
[1:45:29] hello
[1:45:31] you're not somebody else you're him
[1:45:33] and another form
[1:45:35] but it's still him
[1:45:39] eve mrs adam was revealing mr adam
[1:45:47] that's right she was she was his mystery
[1:45:50] it was hid in him he had it hid in
[1:45:52] himself it had to he had to be unveiled
[1:45:55] in order for that mystery to be revealed
[1:46:01] amen
[1:46:05] all right
[1:46:06] and it was in the seventh day
[1:46:10] that the mystery was made known that's
[1:46:12] why i said the subject here is the com
[1:46:14] the capstone revelation of the creation
[1:46:17] of god
[1:46:19] because when the seventh angel's message
[1:46:20] sounded he said when he sounds his
[1:46:22] message the mystery the mystery of god
[1:46:25] would be finished
[1:46:28] finished
[1:46:32] what in
[1:46:37] where is she
[1:46:38] where is he
[1:46:43] where is it finished what's the capstone
[1:46:46] where what what was the crowning act of
[1:46:47] that creation when god finished it on
[1:46:49] the seventh day
[1:46:53] genesis 2 he finished it it was the
[1:46:55] seventh day
[1:46:59] is that right
[1:47:00] the message that was hid
[1:47:02] in
[1:47:03] and remember he he said in verse 27 of
[1:47:06] chapter one male and female created he
[1:47:08] them
[1:47:10] in there in his image created in his
[1:47:12] image in his image he made him male and
[1:47:15] female in his image so what is his image
[1:47:18] male and female
[1:47:22] what would be the full complete
[1:47:23] revelation of himself
[1:47:26] it would have to be the portion of
[1:47:28] himself to revealed in the seventh day
[1:47:31] because the second adam paid the price
[1:47:33] for somebody and he came and opened the
[1:47:35] book of the revelation of who that is
[1:47:37] and would reveal it and you would take
[1:47:38] your position
[1:47:43] amen
[1:47:45] all right i'm losing you
[1:47:47] because you're tired
[1:47:49] but i'm just going to try to close this
[1:47:50] off come back to it
[1:47:54] i wish you'd shut up so we could go home
[1:47:58] now i hope you didn't say that
[1:48:00] because it's not me i keep being pressed
[1:48:02] here to get this out
[1:48:05] we've got to get this much
[1:48:06] it's not something that just has hid
[1:48:08] well it'll be revealed someday it's
[1:48:10] already been revealed and it's being
[1:48:12] revealed and she's growing in that light
[1:48:17] she's moving right up to her right up to
[1:48:19] the position of maturity all the
[1:48:21] greenness is baked out of her
[1:48:24] she's not afraid to declare what he is
[1:48:26] who he is what she is and the thing that
[1:48:29] the that the earth and then jesus said
[1:48:30] he didn't know until revelations chapter
[1:48:33] one
[1:48:35] the brother brahm said then he comes
[1:48:37] with the full revelation of what that
[1:48:38] was
[1:48:39] only the father knew it
[1:48:42] but it was sealed with seven seals there
[1:48:44] you are
[1:48:46] and here we are
[1:48:48] here's our sign to the end sir
[1:48:51] here's the sign of it
[1:48:53] right here
[1:48:57] it's a mystery that god had in his mind
[1:48:58] the back part about his purpose what was
[1:49:01] his heart purpose without going to the
[1:49:02] quote page 149 church age book what was
[1:49:05] god's heart purpose brother brahm said
[1:49:07] he had one purpose in mind one purpose
[1:49:10] to fulfill one purpose to make known and
[1:49:13] he he waited until this very end put it
[1:49:16] in the hand of the seventh angel came
[1:49:18] down himself and unveiled it
[1:49:21] so that he could unite he would come
[1:49:23] uniting with the body head with the body
[1:49:26] don't you see this is head time brother
[1:49:28] braham said the head and the body has
[1:49:30] not will has become one unit
[1:49:37] amen and he says and he says now here we
[1:49:40] are he said in that number two he said
[1:49:43] the message of the seventh angel he said
[1:49:45] this this revelation of thunder the mess
[1:49:47] excuse me the the messenger of malachi 4
[1:49:49] and revelation 10 are going to do two
[1:49:51] things
[1:49:53] you're aware of that
[1:49:55] he said he said the second thing
[1:49:58] let me just find that here
[1:50:01] would be
[1:50:04] oh let me finish one other thing here
[1:50:06] before i go there i'm trying to i'm
[1:50:08] going to try to close now there was some
[1:50:10] reason that god let these seven these
[1:50:12] seven voices be thundered because it
[1:50:14] must come
[1:50:16] we find that christ the lamb took the
[1:50:18] book in his hand
[1:50:19] did he
[1:50:20] he sure did he said he christ the lamb
[1:50:23] took the book in his hand and he opened
[1:50:25] the seventh seal remember when he took
[1:50:27] the book everything began to rejoice
[1:50:33] amen
[1:50:34] he did the work of redemption he's doing
[1:50:36] the work he continued the work he
[1:50:38] intervened till the last one comes in is
[1:50:40] that right but he's opened the book and
[1:50:42] claimed what he owns
[1:50:43] are you with me it's a part of his
[1:50:45] redemption
[1:50:46] okay and he's interce he's always been
[1:50:48] doing that until that last one and the
[1:50:50] door shuts remember they that were ready
[1:50:53] and i'll come back down to abraham and
[1:50:54] sarah but they that were ready went in
[1:50:56] with him to the marriage and
[1:50:59] we don't know how much later down the
[1:51:00] load that was but and the door was shut
[1:51:06] last one got the revelation the last one
[1:51:07] come in the last one
[1:51:10] to know our position in place
[1:51:13] matured
[1:51:14] amen
[1:51:17] that's it
[1:51:18] look at what day we're in see
[1:51:20] right here israel's in her homeland
[1:51:23] fig trees putting forth their buds
[1:51:25] this economical council's communism is

[1:51:30] church is uniting to try to destroy
[1:51:32] communism

[1:51:42] in make a compact with rome and brother
[1:51:44] bram said the bride won't even see that

[1:51:50] able to buy or sell he will not allow
[1:51:52] his bride to go through it go back to
[1:51:54] the first seal and see if that's not
[1:51:55] what he said
[1:51:59] he'll keep her from it
[1:52:01] so how close are we
[1:52:04] by the coming of the lord

[1:52:13] unveiled secret
[1:52:16] isn't known to the public can't be known
[1:52:18] to the public
[1:52:20] until that time that she he who let us
[1:52:23] will let until he the bride christ the
[1:52:25] bride be taken out of the way then that
[1:52:28] that beast will be revealed

[1:52:39] when she goes up satan is kicked
[1:52:42] out amen is that right
[1:52:45] see but how have we overcome him
[1:52:48] by the blood of the lamb and by the
[1:52:50] testimony that we're spoken about right
[1:52:52] here this morning by our testimony of
[1:52:55] what he has provided and is doing we're
[1:52:57] not afraid to testify of that and we're
[1:52:59] testifying of it we have victory through
[1:53:01] the blood and the testimony which we
[1:53:04] hold

[1:53:50] marriage seminar
[1:53:51] which we had when i was a pastor in
[1:53:53] arizona we had
[1:53:54] barry out when you're just starting
[1:53:56] those so we enjoyed them i think you'll
[1:53:58] enjoy them i think other you think
[1:54:00] trevor carrier going
[1:54:01] i don't know all but i hope somebody's
[1:54:03] here
[1:54:05] maybe i'll continue i'd like to get in
[1:54:07] who are those righteous that are saved
[1:54:09] that are given eternal life at the
[1:54:11] judgment that's another message i'd like
[1:54:12] to bring
[1:54:14] that's a great mystery
[1:54:16] and why and why are they saved
[1:54:19] and why are those that had their name of
[1:54:21] the book taken away
[1:54:23] why are they cast into outer darkness
[1:54:26] what's the separation between the sheep
[1:54:28] and the goats what makes the difference
[1:54:33] lord willie you pray for me i've had
[1:54:34] that in my heart for a year or better to
[1:54:36] bring that message
[1:54:39] i'm gonna have to take a little time
[1:54:40] hopefully i'll have a printer that
[1:54:42] prints
[1:54:44] and
[1:54:45] do it if not i should have brought my
[1:54:46] laptop down here it's the size of this
[1:54:48] screen
[1:54:50] but i could have used it
[1:54:52] but maybe it's a good thing i didn't use
[1:54:54] it
[1:54:56] see god does all things well
[1:54:59] absolutely he's got full control i'm
[1:55:01] saying that because i believe that with
[1:55:03] all my heart
[1:55:04] i don't care what it is
[1:55:05] is he leading you or he's not leading
[1:55:07] you what do you believe if you believe
[1:55:09] he's leading you just give yourself to
[1:55:11] him and quit trying to figure out how
[1:55:12] he's doing it
[1:55:14] but but but if the holy spirit is
[1:55:16] leading you he'll keep you in line with
[1:55:18] the word
[1:55:20] he's not going to lead you away from the
[1:55:22] word remember that
[1:55:24] he can't lead you away from the word
[1:55:25] you've got another spirit leading you
[1:55:27] then
[1:55:29] okay
[1:55:30] can i finish this no i mean can i get
[1:55:32] done what i want to get done right no
[1:55:34] just this much
[1:55:36] all right
[1:55:37] let's get this
[1:55:40] there's some reason they thundered
[1:55:42] we find that christ the lamb took the
[1:55:44] book christ the lamb who did we see
[1:55:46] christ
[1:55:48] lord let's just see is coming quickening
[1:55:50] power lets us see his coming
[1:55:52] let me say that again quickening power
[1:55:54] direct quote rising of the sun
[1:55:55] quickening power lets us see is coming
[1:55:57] and he says notice it was our lord up
[1:55:59] there we see
[1:56:01] our lord
[1:56:03] our husband
[1:56:05] wonder what he came for
[1:56:08] probably the marriage
[1:56:13] absolutely
[1:56:15] that's exactly right
[1:56:18] the rapture he said is the wedding
[1:56:19] supper
[1:56:22] amen he said let us be glad to rejoice
[1:56:24] because now
[1:56:25] the son of man revealing himself unites
[1:56:27] the two together and they become one
[1:56:28] brother brown said it very emphatically
[1:56:30] the head and the body here come one unit
[1:56:32] he said no longer or twain they are one
[1:56:36] that way but not a different person than
[1:56:39] adam
[1:56:40] she was adam revealed
[1:56:42] in fullness
[1:56:45] she had to be manifested in order for
[1:56:47] the mystery to be completed she had to
[1:56:50] be manifest are you hearing this this
[1:56:52] morning
[1:56:57] all right in her alone
[1:56:59] all right
[1:57:00] because it's her time now he says but
[1:57:02] you see
[1:57:04] he said with the book in his hand he
[1:57:06] opened the seventh seal the lamb took
[1:57:08] the book and with the book the book in
[1:57:10] his hand he opened the seventh seal and
[1:57:12] they all began to shout and john said
[1:57:14] all in heaven all above all below heard
[1:57:16] i shout brother brown said
[1:57:18] he must have looked behind the veil
[1:57:21] into that little room and said there's
[1:57:24] john
[1:57:26] yeah i didn't vision it this way but
[1:57:28] there's that little room he said
[1:57:31] i didn't envision that tent vision this
[1:57:33] way but he said do you understand it's
[1:57:35] been manifest right here before us
[1:57:38] amen
[1:57:40] and he said that little room right there
[1:57:41] going behind the veil they couldn't
[1:57:42] explain what they'd just come out and
[1:57:44] see neither can i this morning
[1:57:46] i can only tell you what he said
[1:57:49] but i'm speaking the revelation of the
[1:57:52] hour it serves is this the sign
[1:57:55] of the end
[1:57:57] brother brown said it was
[1:58:00] amen
[1:58:01] so he said he had the book in his hand
[1:58:03] did he he sure did
[1:58:06] the word of the lord comes to his
[1:58:08] prophets it had to be a prophet
[1:58:11] because the revelation that was hid now
[1:58:14] was being revealed
[1:58:16] and he can't do it any other way but
[1:58:18] through prophets amen
[1:58:21] do we really understand
[1:58:23] what god just said that he will do
[1:58:25] nothing himself until first he reveals
[1:58:28] it to his servants the prophets
[1:58:30] do you not think he had to get that
[1:58:32] revelation firth and express it to us
[1:58:34] and when he did that we become alive
[1:58:38] we are a spoken word seed a spoken word
[1:58:41] creation a spoken word bride
[1:58:44] is that right
[1:58:46] do you realize that when he spoke these
[1:58:48] things that had to come to manifestation
[1:58:49] somewhere
[1:58:53] amen that's exactly and here you are and
[1:58:55] here i am and here she is there is again
[1:58:58] in this day another people in the land
[1:59:02] you see there is again another this is
[1:59:05] another day there is again another
[1:59:07] people
[1:59:09] who with this word
[1:59:11] amen is going out
[1:59:14] i wish i could find that quote i think i
[1:59:16] got it in here somewhere but we'll have
[1:59:17] to pick it up another time
[1:59:19] it's hidden mystery
[1:59:22] but you see he had it in his hand he
[1:59:24] opened that seventh seal
[1:59:28] do you understand why the seventh seal
[1:59:30] opened and als and brother brown said
[1:59:33] seven voices
[1:59:35] seven thunders one message
[1:59:40] amen remember what he said there he said
[1:59:43] seven seven
[1:59:44] seven
[1:59:46] one message one message he said seven
[1:59:48] thunders what he said
[1:59:51] amen
[1:59:53] we heard the trumpet
[1:59:54] what'd we hear the seventh trumpet
[1:59:58] trumpet always denotes a gathering
[2:00:01] amen or war spiritual warfare amen
[2:00:05] are going out a time of of leaving
[2:00:08] satan doing everything warfare taking
[2:00:10] the promise
[2:00:12] but it's a gathering
[2:00:17] amen all right
[2:00:20] and in that time of that seventh trumpet
[2:00:23] what's going to come forth
[2:00:27] a rapture
[2:00:29] a rising of the of those asleep
[2:00:32] what'd they hear
[2:00:34] what are they hearing
[2:00:36] they had to hear the voice of the
[2:00:37] resurrection
[2:00:40] all right what do we did what did you
[2:00:42] hear when you come alive and come out of
[2:00:44] your sleep
[2:00:46] you heard this voice
[2:00:49] the seven thunders
[2:00:51] is our awakening
[2:00:53] do you realize that brother branham said
[2:00:55] they don't realize the awakening of the
[2:00:57] bride they're missing it they don't
[2:00:59] realize the awakening of the bride
[2:01:02] being spiritual being religious they
[2:01:04] they say well there are certain things
[2:01:06] the word's got to come to pass
[2:01:07] everything we're still looking for that
[2:01:08] great thing to happen and what they
[2:01:09] haven't recognized
[2:01:12] message recognizing your day and its
[2:01:14] message he said what they haven't
[2:01:16] recognized is the awakening
[2:01:18] of the bride
[2:01:22] all right
[2:01:24] we were in a deep sleep but we were
[2:01:25] never dead we were always we're alive in
[2:01:27] him we just had a time to be awakened
[2:01:30] and right back around
[2:01:32] to our theophany then
[2:01:34] in a glorified body
[2:01:36] we had to bypass we had to come down
[2:01:38] here in the earth to be tested and tried
[2:01:41] amen
[2:01:42] because those those attributes of him
[2:01:44] had to be manifest every one of them
[2:01:47] oh what a great plan what a great time
[2:01:50] let's close this off can i am i allowed
[2:01:52] to close it off now
[2:01:56] don't stop pulling
[2:01:59] no
[2:02:00] let me just get to one one more two
[2:02:02] things here it's a hidden mystery he had
[2:02:05] the seal he opened the seventh seal but
[2:02:06] you see it's a hidden it's a hidden
[2:02:08] mystery he didn't say it was an obvious
[2:02:10] revealed he said it's hidden
[2:02:12] it's a hidden mystery
[2:02:14] he said no one knows it but right what
[2:02:17] he said
[2:02:18] he said no one would know his coming
[2:02:20] they would not know about this seven
[2:02:22] thundered mystery so you see it's
[2:02:24] connected together
[2:02:30] amen it's connected
[2:02:33] he said the public wouldn't know it
[2:02:36] but he said the bride would
[2:02:38] so he's not talking about nobody knowing
[2:02:39] it be the bride
[2:02:41] amen nobody in their own carnal thinking
[2:02:44] never figured out but it's his coming
[2:02:47] it's his mystery of his coming and
[2:02:48] that's what's taking place that's why
[2:02:49] it's so mysterious
[2:02:51] because the bride's catching the
[2:02:53] revelation and preaching it and the
[2:02:55] devil says i can't stand this i can't
[2:02:58] stand this she's going to destroy me
[2:03:00] she's going to put me in the lake of
[2:03:02] fire she's going to say away with you
[2:03:06] she's going to judge me someday and i
[2:03:07] can't stand this
[2:03:10] why because the bride with an open book
[2:03:12] is being judged right now
[2:03:16] we're not judged out there at the white
[2:03:17] throne we're judged right now
[2:03:20] and we may have to go through a
[2:03:21] millennium before the white throne to
[2:03:23] learn how to rule
[2:03:25] like we should see there can be a lot
[2:03:26] more unveiled than more than you realize
[2:03:29] how to act like a queen more see
[2:03:32] see
[2:03:33] it's all we don't know
[2:03:35] we know there's a millennium
[2:03:37] and we're going to rule over someone
[2:03:38] because we rule the rod of iron
[2:03:41] he does
[2:03:42] is that right
[2:03:44] i'll just let you feed on that a little
[2:03:45] bit
[2:03:46] amen
[2:03:50] all right it's connected together but he
[2:03:52] said these he said this
[2:03:55] said this number two
[2:03:59] after he turned the hearts he'll turn
[2:04:00] the hearts of the children to the
[2:04:01] father's two he will reveal the
[2:04:03] mysteries of the seven thunders in
[2:04:05] revelations 10 which are the revelations
[2:04:07] contained in the seven seals
[2:04:11] which are divinely revealed truths those
[2:04:13] divinely revealed truths will literally
[2:04:16] turn the hearts of the children to the
[2:04:18] pentecostal father so you see this is
[2:04:20] happening before we rapture
[2:04:23] in a body in a meeting in the air
[2:04:25] there you are
[2:04:28] so it's it's the mystery of his coming
[2:04:33] amen
[2:04:36] and it's the revelation contained in the
[2:04:38] seals
[2:04:39] what is that mystery
[2:04:41] you
[2:04:44] you
[2:04:45] you're the finished mystery of god
[2:04:48] amen
[2:04:50] amen amen amen you had to come to your
[2:04:53] position and place the only one that
[2:04:55] could bring you to that place is him
[2:04:57] that's always done it all along
[2:05:01] nobody else you can't figure it out you
[2:05:02] were you weren't even looking for it
[2:05:06] he was looking for you
[2:05:09] but when he found you you knew it was
[2:05:10] right because when he screamed
[2:05:14] inside you answered
[2:05:18] well that sounds good i'll just figure
[2:05:19] it all out no something inside you
[2:05:21] answered and said
[2:05:23] that's what i've been looking for
[2:05:28] and when you get a hold of that you
[2:05:30] can't get enough of it it doesn't become
[2:05:31] drudgery to you it becomes an everyday
[2:05:34] living and everyday walk it becomes an
[2:05:36] everyday unfolding it just is a love
[2:05:38] affair with her him and his bride and
[2:05:40] the more you get into it the hotter the
[2:05:42] battle becomes
[2:05:45] because you're an overcomer
[2:05:47] you're more than an overcomer you're
[2:05:49] victorious you are his victory because
[2:05:52] you are himself reveal
[2:05:57] you are his victory
[2:05:59] do you love him
[2:06:02] in the light of his resurrection
[2:06:04] we still go forth
[2:06:06] in his name
[2:06:08] amen aren't you glad that little germ
[2:06:10] that was to be you
[2:06:12] that was in him
[2:06:13] found you
[2:06:15] aren't you glad that the full heart
[2:06:16] purpose of god as i said i didn't get to
[2:06:19] a lot of this but the full purpose the
[2:06:21] full he said remember this seventh seal
[2:06:23] cannot be broke to the public until the
[2:06:25] bride leaves
[2:06:28] see in order for her to leave she had to
[2:06:30] see that
[2:06:32] oh i'm just so thankful do you realize
[2:06:34] the seeing the revealing of it seeing
[2:06:36] yourself positionally placed oh it's so
[2:06:38] good bride to see ourselves positionally
[2:06:40] placed in christ
[2:06:42] christ is the mystery that's revealed in
[2:06:45] her alone
[2:06:47] the hope of glory
[2:06:49] amen amen amen do you realize there's no
[2:06:53] such a thing if well someday i'll have
[2:06:55] to i'll fall away and i'll do no no you
[2:06:58] never could fall away you always were in
[2:07:01] him
[2:07:02] your name is revealed there
[2:07:04] you're the mystery you're his thought
[2:07:06] you can get up in the morning crawl out
[2:07:08] of bed maybe achy and everything else
[2:07:10] and but say lord i'm your thought
[2:07:13] expressed
[2:07:16] i'm rising in your name i'm your thought
[2:07:19] express i was in that book of yourself
[2:07:21] the record of yourself i was in your
[2:07:23] very thoughts i existed in your thoughts
[2:07:25] i was eternal in your thoughts and i
[2:07:27] never can be anything but eternal
[2:07:31] and you have awakened me with the
[2:07:33] reality and revelation
[2:07:35] and the unsealing of yourself
[2:07:37] you've awakened that in me that i've
[2:07:39] looked forward to and see no more do i
[2:07:42] have confidence in this old man out here
[2:07:44] in my enemy but this enemy is conquered
[2:07:48] i have no confidence in that i don't
[2:07:50] confidence in my mind in my my thinking
[2:07:53] lord just let me preach the truth or be
[2:07:54] silent
[2:07:56] preach the word or be silent
[2:07:58] amen i have no business flirting around
[2:08:01] with other things
[2:08:02] eating off of that tree carnality
[2:08:06] carnal thinking our warfare i'll say it
[2:08:07] again the weapons of our warfare are not
[2:08:10] carnal
[2:08:11] you don't deliver anybody by carnality
[2:08:14] it's the word or nothing
[2:08:16] you bring the word or stay out of it
[2:08:20] god doesn't need your theology it
[2:08:22] doesn't need your reasoning
[2:08:26] god wants to do something with my spirit
[2:08:28] let his word it's in my soul
[2:08:30] quicken that word to me it'll release me
[2:08:33] what am i doing i'm bringing every
[2:08:34] thought under obedience i bring my
[2:08:36] spirit under obedience to what's in my
[2:08:38] heart
[2:08:42] and then that what does that do rules
[2:08:44] the body
[2:08:45] your soul rules your spirit your spirit
[2:08:48] rules the body
[2:08:50] so keep your head out of those carnal
[2:08:52] books
[2:08:54] and that carnal warfare and carnal
[2:08:55] psychologies and carnal everything of
[2:08:57] man
[2:08:58] and realize to do that and continue with
[2:09:00] that you're breaking the word you're
[2:09:02] tearing down everything that god said
[2:09:04] for you to do
[2:09:10] and if you don't think so prove it by
[2:09:11] the word what you're doing
[2:09:15] because i can prove it by the word that
[2:09:16] you're not doing it
[2:09:20] all right

[2:10:17] through other things you learn it
[2:10:18] through this message
[2:10:21] that if we didn't have this message this
[2:10:24] would just be words on a book
[2:10:28] all they'd be
[2:10:29] you would never understand what it was
[2:10:31] unless the holy spirit that wrote this
[2:10:33] that brought the message
[2:10:34] you would never see it
[2:10:37] even if the message did speak it
[2:10:39] you've got to have the holy ghost in
[2:10:40] order to lighten give you light amen

[2:11:27] of it

[2:12:42] i can tell i get it here and i just let
[2:12:44] me see if i can find it
[2:12:47] see he said brother brown said this this
[2:12:49] is a secret he kept it a secret amen he
[2:12:52] kept it through the ages he kept it
[2:12:56] but we see that secret is the coming of
[2:12:59] the lord
[2:12:59] [Music]
[2:13:01] that's why i took you to matthew i
[2:13:02] haven't even got to the other scriptures
[2:13:05] i apologize for that i had three other
[2:13:08] scriptures to read
[2:13:10] actually four
[2:13:12] genesis but i i talked to you about adam
[2:13:15] i mean yes adam and eve
[2:13:17] [Music]
[2:13:18] but that's what had to be restored back
[2:13:22] oh yes
[2:13:23] oh yes
[2:13:25] just a quick view here
[2:13:29] carnal eve
[2:13:31] got impregnated by adam first before he
[2:13:34] before adam i mean be the satan the
[2:13:36] serpent before adam knew her how may
[2:13:38] know that it was his wife but he hadn't
[2:13:41] been with her yet
[2:13:42] got
[2:13:43] to eve first the serpent satan
[2:13:46] all right then
[2:13:49] christ did the same thing
[2:13:53] are you with me
[2:13:54] he got to marry first
[2:13:58] before satan
[2:14:00] are you with me he got to her he had to
[2:14:02] come through the woman again he had to
[2:14:03] reverse the crime
[2:14:05] so he had to come through a woman
[2:14:09] and he did that are you with me
[2:14:11] all right that word was promised to
[2:14:13] return to her again the second adam
[2:14:16] amen
[2:14:17] and he died for took her place
[2:14:21] died for you and i took our place
[2:14:23] to redeem us
[2:14:25] is that right and poured out his life
[2:14:27] which is the germ of life
[2:14:29] which is in the blood life
[2:14:31] and by that we could come in union with
[2:14:33] him
[2:14:35] amen are you with me but he hadn't
[2:14:37] finished it until down here at the end
[2:14:40] when we could come in union see because
[2:14:43] when that pentecostal bride the
[2:14:45] beginning
[2:14:47] started out
[2:14:48] before
[2:14:49] god could get to her for the marriage
[2:14:52] satan got to her again
[2:14:54] are you with me you understand what i'm
[2:14:56] saying all right then she went through
[2:14:58] the dark ages
[2:14:59] [Music]
[2:15:01] and then up here at the end
[2:15:04] that chain had to be broke
[2:15:06] he had to break that cycle
[2:15:08] is that right how could he break that
[2:15:10] cycle because there was a second atom
[2:15:12] that didn't go naked with her
[2:15:14] are you with me
[2:15:15] there was a second adam that already
[2:15:17] paid the price
[2:15:18] said she's mine i can't lose her
[2:15:22] and i'm going to reveal myself to her
[2:15:24] and she's going to come out of that
[2:15:25] dogma and that dark denominationalism
[2:15:28] and she's going to fulfill the
[2:15:29] scriptures of my coming
[2:15:31] my coming in bride form
[2:15:33] i have to come and repeat that again
[2:15:36] back
[2:15:38] amen now look at abraham and sarah
[2:15:41] abraham and sarah had their pentecost
[2:15:44] they had a change
[2:15:46] body physical i'm talking about physical
[2:15:49] natural they had a body change brother
[2:15:51] bam said noticing what will happen with
[2:15:53] every predestinated is that right
[2:15:56] by their by their then so they had that
[2:15:59] so what'd they do
[2:16:00] where'd they go from there
[2:16:02] it went down to bemelic is that right
[2:16:05] they went right down into that old
[2:16:06] denominational religious
[2:16:09] system down there and caused
[2:16:11] abraham to lie and said you say to that
[2:16:15] king i'm your
[2:16:16] brother
[2:16:18] you imagine that and they let seed
[2:16:22] thank god for grace
[2:16:24] that's my prophet you'll pray for him
[2:16:26] see all right see god didn't even see it
[2:16:29] did he he had a predestinated plan he
[2:16:31] had a plan of redemption that had to be
[2:16:33] fulfilled
[2:16:35] i don't want you to miss this now and so
[2:16:37] here here they already had they had
[2:16:38] their change they went through their
[2:16:39] pentecost but something follows
[2:16:41] pentecost
[2:16:43] it's called marriage
[2:16:44] the same thing that followed pentecost
[2:16:46] at the beginning
[2:16:48] but they didn't get to the marriage now
[2:16:50] god said i'm going to save you from this
[2:16:52] i've redeemed you and i've interceded
[2:16:54] for you and i'm going to reveal my word
[2:16:56] and what do you do they went down there
[2:16:58] and abimelech had a dream
[2:17:00] god stopped it right there
[2:17:03] he wouldn't let the devil
[2:17:06] come in there and to
[2:17:08] get to eve first before she had abraham
[2:17:13] she hadn't even conceived yet
[2:17:15] are you with me she hadn't even
[2:17:16] conceived yet neither did this bride of
[2:17:18] pentecost conceive yet but they had a
[2:17:21] change they were a new creation they
[2:17:23] were a new birth they were a new
[2:17:24] creation is that right so if we come to
[2:17:26] our pentecost a new creation well we've
[2:17:28] got to come into marriage they that were
[2:17:30] ready went into marriage
[2:17:32] with him
[2:17:32] [Music]
[2:17:38] if if abimelech would have been allowed
[2:17:40] to do that he would have got to sarah
[2:17:41] before abraham
[2:17:43] [Music]
[2:17:45] and just think about it sarah was a
[2:17:47] little weak you know
[2:17:49] in a week in faith but i'll tell you
[2:17:51] after all those happenings she saw the
[2:17:52] mighty god unveiled because after that
[2:17:55] verse 20 chapter 21 of genesis and then
[2:17:58] after coming back out of that country
[2:18:01] out of that denominational system she
[2:18:03] conceived
[2:18:06] and she started bearing his son unto us
[2:18:08] the son had given unto us a child is
[2:18:10] born amen are you with me it's just like
[2:18:13] it's just like mary
[2:18:15] the secret brother branham said is that
[2:18:17] he's in you the word is in the bride
[2:18:20] just like mary
[2:18:23] in order to have the coming sun she had
[2:18:25] to bear that seed
[2:18:30] and they had to be changed to do it
[2:18:33] are you with me okay i'll just drop that
[2:18:35] in maybe cover that a little bit later
[2:18:37] but there it is
[2:18:39] glory you see the hour you're in
[2:18:42] you see the mystery of his coming
[2:18:46] my father had it hid it was hit in the
[2:18:48] back part of his mind i don't even know
[2:18:49] it i can't even say it jesus speaking
[2:18:53] as a man he said i don't have that
[2:18:55] revelation
[2:18:55] [Music]
[2:18:59] that'll skin you
[2:19:01] i thought he had revelation of
[2:19:02] everything brother brahm said no he
[2:19:03] didn't he said because there was things
[2:19:05] that had to be fulfilled that he
[2:19:07] couldn't fulfill back then but now he
[2:19:09] will now do do within the bride through
[2:19:12] the bride
[2:19:14] he will now work in and through his
[2:19:16] bride to finish what he didn't finish
[2:19:20] and she knows it and knows that it's him
[2:19:22] working
[2:19:24] and she has his mind
[2:19:26] do you glad you have the mind of god
