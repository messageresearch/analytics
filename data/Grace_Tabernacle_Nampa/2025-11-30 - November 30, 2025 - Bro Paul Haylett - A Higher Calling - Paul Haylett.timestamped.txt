[4:00] What gift of grace
[4:03] is Jesus my redeemer.
[4:09] There is no more
[4:11] for heaven now to give.
[4:17] He is my joy,
[4:19] my righteousness and freom.
[4:24] My steadfast love,
[4:27] my deep and boundless peace.
[4:32] To this I hope.
[4:35] My hope is only Jesus.

[4:47] Oh, how strange and divine. I can sing

[5:12] the Savior, he will stay.
[5:18] I labor on.
[5:20] In weakness and rejoicing,
[5:25] for in my need
[5:28] his power is displayed.
[5:33] To this I hold.
[5:35] My shepherd will defend me.
[5:41] Through the deepest
[5:43] valley he will lead.
[5:48] Oh, the night has been won. And I shall
[5:54] overcome
[5:56] yet not I, but through Christ
[6:00] in me.

[6:18] For Jesus bled and suffered for my
[6:23] pardon
[6:25] and he was raised to overthrow the
[6:30] grave.
[6:33] Faith I hold my sin has been defeated.
[6:40] Jesus now
[6:43] and ever is my plea.
[6:48] Oh, the chains are released. I can sing
[6:53] I am free yet not I but through Christ
[6:59] in me.
[7:02] With every breath
[7:05] I long to follow Jesus,
[7:10] for he has said that he will bring me
[7:15] home.
[7:17] And day by day I know he will renew me
[7:25] until I stand with joy before the
[7:30] throne.
[7:32] To this I hope my hope is only Jesus.
[7:40] All the gloryy
[7:43] ever more to him.
[7:47] When the race is complete, still my lips
[7:53] shall repeat. Yet not I, but through
[7:58] Christ in me.
[8:02] To this I hope.

[8:13] ever more to him.

[32:44] went unannounced this morning and I I'm
[32:47] going to embarrass him a little bit
[32:49] because I asked him to speak and he
[32:51] turned me down. But uh brother Stefan is
[32:55] here. Um, a brother Adrien, I I would
[32:58] make it more personal, is is here and we

[33:32] were gone just a moment of time in one
[33:36] sense, but then it seemed like a long
[33:38] time in another sense. And uh so just
[33:41] want to bring a couple things up before
[33:43] you this morning. We want to remember
[33:45] brother Ron Peterson in prayer as he has
[33:48] not been feeling well and uh went for
[33:51] another checkup. And uh they say that he
[33:53] has a calcification of a heart valve.
[33:56] And uh brother Ron is is uh no longer
[34:00] really what you would call a spring
[34:01] chicken, but still has a lot of a lot of
[34:04] energy. Amen. Brother David's smiling at
[34:06] me when he talks about spring chickens
[34:08] here. Amen. But um so just remember
[34:12] brother Ron in prayer. Uh the doctors
[34:14] are looking into what what they can do
[34:18] uh to to deal with this heart valve.
[34:21] Amen. It might require open heart
[34:23] surgery. Uh but uh we just want to do
[34:26] that. And I know we know our sister
[34:28] April's heart um she um is is a very go
[34:34] get them person and sometimes you know
[34:36] the schedule just gets too busy. So
[34:39] please remember her in prayer. And um
[34:42] just thinking about it this morning. Uh
[34:44] just uh woke up this morning thinking uh
[34:48] about our sister Nenah back in Daesque.
[34:50] And um we just want uh the Lord just to
[34:53] be with her, lead her, guide her. We
[34:56] just kind of have at least a portion of
[34:58] her we can claim here as as her children
[35:00] are here in the church. And uh but woke
[35:04] up thinking about her and just want the
[35:05] Lord to just uh be there for her. the
[35:08] circumstances there. Uh we'll be a
[35:11] little bit vague uh on this on purpose,
[35:14] but um you as a church have recently
[35:17] given some support to a a family there
[35:20] in the Ukraine that their village uh as
[35:23] the brother shares with us uh their
[35:25] village actually no longer exists. It
[35:28] has been completely destroyed. There's
[35:30] not a single house standing, nothing
[35:32] there. they have to flee from that area
[35:36] with literally what they could carry in
[35:38] their hands and uh so uh by God's grace
[35:43] just the way things funnel through uh it
[35:46] come to uh the attention of the church
[35:48] here uh of the need that is there for
[35:51] that personally and you know that God is
[35:54] leading or bringing things to come in a
[35:57] certain way when the brother shared as
[36:00] he just reached out and asked for help
[36:03] because there's nothing they can do. Uh
[36:06] to here again be sufficiently vague. If
[36:08] the brother goes and seeks openly a job,
[36:11] he's of a uh age to be forced into the
[36:15] army. So he does not have the
[36:17] opportunity to just go down and and find
[36:19] a job. So they've been living a very
[36:23] primitive life for the last while here.
[36:26] And uh by God's grace uh we can we can
[36:29] help them. And uh so it's you actually
[36:32] the church that is helping this family
[36:34] there in the Ukraine and just lift them
[36:37] up in prayer uh that God would would uh
[36:39] just be there for them and give an
[36:42] answer to their needs. And uh so um
[36:46] youth meeting this coming Friday uh
[36:50] location to be announced. Brother uh
[36:53] Alex, sister Rachel weren't here to ask
[36:54] them if it's okay to use their home
[36:56] again. I got a feeling it will be. But
[36:59] uh let's try and have youth meeting this
[37:02] coming Friday. And um so I trust each
[37:06] one had good Thanksgiving.
[37:07] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[37:08] &gt;&gt; Amen. Just enjoyable time to be together
[37:11] and uh we uh just take a moment to
[37:14] share. So sister Jerry and I flew into
[37:17] Amsterdam
[37:19] uh and uh went down to meetings. They
[37:22] have every year have for over 30 years
[37:24] meetings in America, Netherlands. It's
[37:28] interesting uh you know how I have no
[37:31] idea how the town got named but we went
[37:33] to America and uh so we left America and
[37:37] went to America and uh just a wonderful
[37:40] meetings there. It's kind of a
[37:41] combination of family and then a segment
[37:45] of it is youth and then segment of it is
[37:47] just open word being preached. uh got to
[37:50] see brother Vatitali, sister Ona, their
[37:53] youngest daughter, and uh it was good to
[37:56] see them. Brother Vitali preached some
[37:57] very very good morning services and uh
[38:00] brother Barry Coffee preached the
[38:02] evening services while we were there in
[38:04] the initial start of the services uh the
[38:07] meetings, some other brothers preached.
[38:10] But um lovely time. If you ever need
[38:13] something to do in November, Amen. And I
[38:16] I would thoroughly to uh uh encourage
[38:19] you uh to go. There was uh roughly
[38:22] nobody counted but roughly 700
[38:26] um uh people there and just a a good
[38:29] time. Just a real good beautiful
[38:31] atmosphere. Then Sister Jerry and I went
[38:34] on to Belgium and um uh we spoke there
[38:38] in the church in Nazareth uh Wednesday
[38:40] and Sunday and a a lovely lovely time
[38:43] there. Also, uh, greetings from brother
[38:46] David Iverson. He's, uh, the pastor of
[38:48] the church there in Nazareth. And, uh,
[38:51] uh, Lord willing, one day soon, uh,
[38:54] we'll get brother David to come, uh,
[38:57] and, uh, maybe even possibly bring some
[38:59] of his children and visit us. Uh Europe
[39:03] has very strong school standards. So
[39:05] there's no way to just pull your kids
[39:08] out of school and and take a trip and
[39:12] then their time that school is over till
[39:15] it starts again is is very short. And uh
[39:18] but by God's grace uh we can get brother
[39:21] David to come. And then um speaking with
[39:24] brother Dwayne Far yesterday and uh uh
[39:29] brother Dwayne sister Connie the church
[39:30] in Saskatoon send their greetings also
[39:33] to you. So you know we're not alone.
[39:36] That's the beautiful thing saints is we
[39:38] uh sometimes Satan would try to isolate
[39:41] us and make us feel like we are alone.
[39:43] But I can tell you there are saints
[39:45] around the world that pray for this
[39:48] congregation and uh we should and I hope
[39:51] faithfully that we are praying for them
[39:54] also. Amen. Putting a wall as the
[39:57] prophet showed us putting a wall around
[39:59] each other a wall of prayer. The Holy
[40:02] Spirit would then surround each and
[40:04] every one of us leading us and guiding
[40:05] us. And uh I believe that with all of my
[40:08] heart. Amen. That my prayer matters that
[40:10] your prayer matters. Amen. So just a
[40:13] lovely time and we want to say we missed
[40:16] you. Amen. And uh so it's good to be
[40:19] home. Amen. So let's just stand and go
[40:22] into the word. I want to speak to you
[40:23] this morning. Thank you musicians. Amen.
[40:26] Enjoyed the song service. I want to
[40:28] speak to you on a higher calling this
[40:30] morning. And uh we turn in our Bibles to
[40:33] Ephesians 1. And I have verses 1-14.
[40:38] Uh but um I don't know. We'll see what
[40:41] we get to uh in in that portion. Got
[40:44] quite a bit of stuff. A amen to preach
[40:47] to you this morning. Amen. Ephesians 1
[40:50] 1-14.
[40:52] Paul, an apostle of Jesus Christ by the
[40:56] will of God to the saints which are at
[40:59] Ephesus and to the faithful in Christ
[41:02] Jesus. So that included you and I this
[41:04] morning. Amen. Grace be to you and peace
[41:07] from God our father and from the Lord
[41:08] Jesus Christ. Blessed be the God and
[41:11] father of our Lord Jesus Christ who hath
[41:14] blessed us past tense. Amen. So it's
[41:16] already done. Blessed us with all
[41:18] spiritual blessing into heavenly places
[41:21] in Christ. Amen. I'll just lay this out
[41:24] right now so you can follow me. God
[41:26] bless you, brother Daniel. Amen. So that
[41:28] you can follow me. My brother and
[41:30] sister, these heavenly places is a
[41:33] higher calling. We don't get there
[41:35] without being called there. And so this
[41:38] calling that God has given in this day
[41:40] all through the ages, but especially in
[41:42] this day, the culmination of time is a a
[41:45] a calling that we can go so far in and
[41:48] of oursel, in other words, we can by
[41:50] just reading the Bible, understand
[41:52] certain things. But the farther you get
[41:54] into this and start to move into this,
[41:58] it comes a point and we'll be a little
[42:00] bit demonstrative today if you don't
[42:01] mind. But there comes a point that we as
[42:04] humans, just a normal person, can only
[42:07] go that far and it comes to a halt.
[42:11] It takes something from God.
[42:12] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[42:13] &gt;&gt; Right? We can't even say that Jesus is
[42:15] the Christ
[42:17] &gt;&gt; without the anointing of the Holy Ghost.
[42:19] So I'm not talking about anyone could
[42:21] say the words Jesus is the Christ. But
[42:23] to say it from the depths of the heart
[42:26] and soul takes anointing of the Holy
[42:28] Ghost. That's a complete surrender of
[42:30] this individual right here. Amen. Me and
[42:33] you surrendering completely to move to a
[42:37] higher calling
[42:38] &gt;&gt; to really understand who we are
[42:41] &gt;&gt; in Jesus Christ.
[42:43] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[42:45] according he's chosen us in him before
[42:47] the foundation of the world that we
[42:49] should be holy and without blame before
[42:51] him in love having predestinated us and
[42:54] to the adoption of children by Jesus
[42:57] Christ to himself according to the good
[42:59] pleasure of his will now I've just come
[43:01] across a little deal the other day a
[43:03] little clip and a man is saying that I
[43:06] can prove scripturally predestination
[43:09] doesn't exist
[43:11] well he had to tear a few pages out of
[43:14] his Bible
[43:15] &gt;&gt; to make that statement. So reason I
[43:18] bring that up is for you and I to
[43:20] understand that when God speaks to your
[43:23] heart and opens it to you, it is so
[43:26] completely clear that we think everyone
[43:29] would see it like that. But not everyone
[43:32] does. It is there a gift of God that has
[43:37] been given to you and I to have a sound
[43:40] mind, a clear mind, and an open heart.
[43:44] Amen. Now, that's not for us to boast.
[43:48] See, some people would say you're
[43:49] arrogant. I've been told that you're
[43:51] arrogant. But let's not misunderstand.
[43:54] When you're confident of something,
[43:57] that's not arrogance.
[43:59] &gt;&gt; Amen. We look at this and we know Jesus
[44:03] Christ is alive and well today.
[44:05] &gt;&gt; It's not arrogance to say that.
[44:08] &gt;&gt; That's a confidence. The word has showed
[44:10] us he is alive and well today.
[44:14] &gt;&gt; Heavenly Father, Lord, we thank you for
[44:16] your grace, for your mercy, for your
[44:19] guidance. And Lord, we just ask you just
[44:20] to guide us this morning through this
[44:23] thought. Father, in your precious name,
[44:25] we pray be with each and everyone. those
[44:27] who are not here, Lord, just reach out
[44:29] and touch their hearts. Speak to them. I
[44:32] pray and Lord, that we could all come
[44:34] just a little bit higher, Lord. That is
[44:36] our heart and desire today. In the name
[44:38] of Jesus Christ, we ask this. Amen. You
[44:41] may be seated.
[44:44] Amen. Having predestinated us unto
[44:46] adoption of children by Jesus Christ to
[44:48] himself according to the good pleasure
[44:51] of his will. So when he adopted us,
[44:53] saints, he didn't adopt us into a
[44:55] denomination. He didn't adopt us into
[44:57] some movement. Now you might say, "Well,
[44:59] brother Paul, isn't the message a
[45:00] movement?" No, my brother and sister,
[45:02] I'll tell you, there is such liberty in
[45:04] the word when it has come. The open word
[45:07] brings us to where we are no longer
[45:09] subject to be held to someone else's
[45:13] standard. We are held to the standard of
[45:16] the word. Amen. And as we stand on the
[45:19] standard of the word, we'll find that he
[45:21] made a promise to us that he would lead
[45:24] us and guide us to all truth. And and
[45:26] praise God if we're able just to hold on
[45:28] to that and say, "You know what? I'm not
[45:30] concerned about being deceived this
[45:32] morning." Amen. Now, you might say that
[45:34] sounds a little bit arrogant. But I'm
[45:36] telling you, when Jesus made a promise
[45:38] and said, "I will lead you and guide you
[45:41] into all truth." You don't have to go
[45:44] find the truth yourself. You have to
[45:46] find Jesus. And when you find Jesus, you
[45:49] will find truth because he said, "I will
[45:52] take you to the truth." So many people
[45:54] say, "Well, I don't know what you're
[45:56] saying, whether it's true or not." My
[45:58] brother and sister, don't try and
[46:00] convince them of what you believe. Just
[46:02] get them to go deeper. Get more sincere
[46:05] and seeking to have a relationship with
[46:07] our Lord Jesus Christ because this is
[46:09] his promise. I can't fulfill his
[46:11] promise. I do my part, you do your part.
[46:14] But when we do our part, we will have
[46:16] Christ on display. Amen. So it's there
[46:19] that we just trust to the things of the
[46:21] Lord. We have redemption. Uh verse
[46:24] seven, through his blood, the
[46:26] forgiveness of sins according to the
[46:27] riches of his grace, wherein he hath
[46:29] abounded towards us in all wisdom and
[46:33] prudence. Now my brother and sister,
[46:35] we're going to uh kind of touch on this
[46:37] in a little bit. Uh but we'll look at
[46:40] this. My brother and sister, the word
[46:41] abound here is to be plentiful. Amen.
[46:45] Wherein he has plentifully been to us.
[46:48] Amen. Can someone say amen? That God has
[46:50] been plentiful. He's abounded to us. He
[46:52] He has not been stingy. He has not held
[46:55] us on some kind of rigid diet where
[46:58] we're just existing. But we as sons and
[47:00] daughters of God can come with
[47:02] authority. We can come with confidence.
[47:05] We can come and say, "You know what?
[47:06] I've been forgiven. Amen. I'm not I hope
[47:09] I've been forgiven or I I think I might
[47:12] be someday. But we can stand here this
[47:14] morning and say the blood of Jesus
[47:16] Christ has forgiven me of my sin. And
[47:20] that gives us a confidence then to press
[47:22] forward. And as we press forward, God
[47:24] doesn't just say, "I want you to keep
[47:26] looking back to this revelation." Now,
[47:28] we have to be careful, right? We don't
[47:30] want to ever forget where we came from.
[47:33] But neither are we called to constantly
[47:35] look back of where we came from. Amen.
[47:38] The coming out of that is not for us to
[47:41] hold that as our landmark. But I just
[47:43] want to use a silly analogy this
[47:45] morning. Amen. I've been on this. This
[47:47] is a real experience that I really can't
[47:50] convey to you, but it's something the
[47:52] Lord just showed me several times back
[47:54] in the years when I was driving truck.
[47:56] There was a highway in Nevada and it's
[47:58] got about a 40mile perfectly straight
[48:01] line that goes across the desert. You
[48:04] come over the mountain right here and
[48:06] you're looking and you see this thin
[48:07] pencil line. And the beautiful part
[48:09] about it is you're driving that first
[48:11] thing in the morning is the light is on
[48:14] the far end of that road through the
[48:16] peak that cuts through the mountain
[48:18] across that valley. So you're driving
[48:20] there and if you're looking right here,
[48:22] all you see is a highway, the bar ditch,
[48:25] some sage brush, some rocks, you see
[48:27] maybe a jack rabbit. But my brother and
[48:29] sister, when we focus on the goal, which
[48:32] is the far,
[48:33] &gt;&gt; right?
[48:34] &gt;&gt; Not here, it's afar. And as we focus on
[48:37] that, amen, you travel through that
[48:40] valley and it ends up being a very short
[48:42] journey because you're not focused on
[48:44] every bump and curve and hump of the
[48:46] road. And when I say curve, I mean
[48:48] that's our curves, right? Did I tell you
[48:50] about the fact that I read the Bible
[48:53] lately
[48:54] and I found a lot of errors?
[48:59] in me.
[49:00] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[49:02] &gt;&gt; There's the bumps.
[49:04] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[49:04] &gt;&gt; There's the curves.
[49:06] &gt;&gt; You see, there's no errors in the word.
[49:09] &gt;&gt; The errors are in us.
[49:11] &gt;&gt; And as we move forward, we'll see this.
[49:13] You know, you can look and be
[49:15] distracted. You'll wander all over the
[49:17] highway. Amen. That if you're looking
[49:20] off to the side. Now, I I'm sure all of
[49:22] you drive like I do. And you know, it's
[49:24] like, hm, squirrel. M. Oh, look at this.
[49:28] M look at that. And you know, my wife is
[49:31] always saying, "Your driving makes me
[49:33] tired."
[49:35] But I've never driven off the road yet.
[49:37] I just drive a little bit extra
[49:40] distance.
[49:42] But when we look to the goal on the end,
[49:44] my brother and sister, we don't see
[49:45] every little thing that's wrong here. We
[49:48] don't see this. And Lord, help us as we
[49:50] look at one another and as we look at
[49:52] our spiritual life, not to get caught up
[49:55] in the daytoday, but to realize you have
[49:57] a promise of the word predestinated and
[49:59] you look to the end to the goal that is
[50:02] there and the rest of this life will
[50:04] pass very quickly. So as we'll look at
[50:07] this, we'll see, amen, that we have
[50:09] attained verse 11, an inheritance, and
[50:12] that being predestinated according to
[50:14] the purpose of him who workketh all
[50:17] things after the counsel of his own
[50:18] will. So I have an inheritance and I've
[50:22] been predestinated to it, not because I
[50:25] think I should be or I think I can
[50:27] attain to, but because he said, "I give
[50:29] it to you." Amen. So God's raising us up
[50:32] out of our thinking of this everyday
[50:35] life of our struggle. And I know none of
[50:38] you ever have battles that you feel like
[50:40] you lost. But my brother and sister, I
[50:42] can tell you that when you feel like you
[50:44] have failed, it's a great drag or
[50:47] hindrance on your life. It's hard to
[50:49] pray. It's hard to read your Bible. It's
[50:50] hard to be friendly. Amen. You don't
[50:53] want fellowship. You want isolation. All
[50:56] of these factors that are there. But God
[50:58] says, "You know what? I've come to
[50:59] deliver you from yourself.
[51:01] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[51:02] &gt;&gt; Isn't that an incredible thing that one
[51:04] of our biggest challenges is to be
[51:06] delivered from our yourself?
[51:09] &gt;&gt; Amen. We say, "I need deliverance from
[51:11] cigarettes. I need deliverance from
[51:12] alcohol. I need deliverance from
[51:14] pornography. I need deliverance from
[51:16] this music." Yeah. Well, get right down
[51:18] to the basics. You need deliverance from
[51:20] yourself. That's right. And when
[51:22] yourself is fully committed to serve
[51:24] God, as the prophet of God taught us,
[51:26] these other things just start to fall
[51:28] away from our life. Don't be saying,
[51:30] "I've got to I've got to be delivered of
[51:32] smoking before I can serve God." Serve
[51:34] God and the smoking will disappear.
[51:37] &gt;&gt; Amen. Serve God and the alcohol will
[51:39] disappear. Serve God and the flesh of
[51:42] your own self will disappear.
[51:45] &gt;&gt; Amen. That's what God wants us to do.
[51:48] Because I tell you, my brother and
[51:49] sister, this is just a little short
[51:51] excerpt out of a sermon I preached many
[51:53] years ago. Amen. We can say here today
[51:56] and we can preach against sin day after
[51:59] day, service after service, and we will
[52:01] just have a challenge that will
[52:03] constantly be preached against. And we
[52:05] will be there just preaching till we're
[52:07] blue in the face. But I tell you what,
[52:09] when we get the Holy Ghost in, the sin
[52:11] leaves. Amen. So, we don't need to worry
[52:14] about preaching against sin constantly.
[52:16] What we need to do is preach and pursue
[52:19] getting the Holy Ghost in. And when the
[52:21] Holy Ghost gets in, Amen. all the trash
[52:24] gets washed out and we find deliverance.
[52:27] Amen. And so that's why Satan wants to
[52:30] make receiving the Holy Ghost, he's
[52:32] constantly as things in our society have
[52:35] progressed. He wants to make it that if
[52:37] you just believe, you know, come to
[52:38] church and believe that Jesus is the
[52:40] Christ, amen, you got the Holy Ghost. My
[52:43] brother and sister, it's much deeper
[52:44] than that. You can't sit here today and
[52:46] say, "Well, I believe God sent a
[52:47] prophet. I must have the Holy Ghost."
[52:49] The devil believes God sent a prophet.
[52:52] &gt;&gt; Amen. So, what we want to do is come,
[52:55] give ourselves over, let the Lord lead
[52:57] us into the word. Don't push your way
[53:00] in, and don't try to drag someone else
[53:02] in. Just live it
[53:04] &gt;&gt; organically, day by day. Just live it.
[53:08] &gt;&gt; Amen. So, that we would come. Now, I
[53:11] want to go because I have quite a bit of
[53:12] scripture here. Ephesians the 2
[53:14] chapter:es 4-8.
[53:16] But God who is rich in mercy for his
[53:20] great love wherewith he loved us. Even
[53:23] when we were dead in sins, that should
[53:26] be a real amen from us. Even when we
[53:28] were dead in sin, he still loved us.
[53:32] &gt;&gt; Hath quickened us together with Christ.
[53:34] By grace ye are saved. and hath raised
[53:37] us up together and made us sit heaven to
[53:40] sit together in heavenly places. You
[53:43] know what? If we could just fulfill
[53:45] verse six, my brother and sister, that
[53:47] we would just re
[53:49] receive or accept the fact he raised us
[53:52] up.
[53:53] &gt;&gt; Amen. No good preacher, no good church,
[53:56] no good this, no good that. It was he
[53:58] himself who lifted us up.
[54:02] Now, this might be counterproductive in
[54:04] the mind of some, but I'm telling you,
[54:06] this message will not save you.
[54:09] &gt;&gt; Jesus Christ and Jesus Christ alone will
[54:11] save you. God says, "I will lead you to
[54:14] that truth. I will lead you to that
[54:16] point." But it don't matter what church
[54:18] you go to, it can't save you. Only that
[54:22] relationship with Jesus Christ. Amen.
[54:24] And he says, "I've raised you up and
[54:27] made you to sit in heavenly places in
[54:30] one position,
[54:32] &gt;&gt; Christ Jesus."
[54:34] &gt;&gt; There's the only position not to sit as
[54:36] a Baptist, a Methodist, a Nazarene, or
[54:39] whatever it might be. Not to sit as a
[54:41] message believer, but to be in that
[54:43] relationship that is Jesus Christ and
[54:46] Christ alone.
[54:47] &gt;&gt; That's the only thing that will save us.
[54:49] Now, don't misunderstand that I'm
[54:51] dinging on what we believe. I believe it
[54:54] with all that is within me. I have given
[54:55] these years trying to just help as it
[54:58] would in this assembly to to move
[55:01] forward my brother and sister. But we
[55:03] have to come to a place that we don't
[55:05] want to have a false reliance.
[55:07] &gt;&gt; I just read a story here recently.
[55:14] Man was on a ship World War II.
[55:18] Their ship was sunk in the English
[55:19] Channel. and they're out there floating
[55:22] in that cold, frigid water and a plane
[55:24] flew over and dropped a life raft
[55:28] and they thought, "We're saved."
[55:31] But the life raft had a hole in it.
[55:35] And while the life raft saved his life
[55:38] in one sense,
[55:40] he had to work for it because for like
[55:44] 32 hours, I believe it was, he had a
[55:47] little cup
[55:49] and he had to throw the water out. As
[55:51] the water ran in, he had to throw it
[55:53] out. Now, my brothers and sisters, we
[55:55] don't believe in a works gospel, but I'm
[55:57] telling you, you have to take the word
[56:00] and throw the world out every single
[56:04] day. Amen.
[56:06] &gt;&gt; We can't just say, "I've got the word.
[56:07] I'm saved. It's finished." No. We have
[56:10] to give our portion. And as the world
[56:13] would try to creep into our lives, do
[56:15] you know what I'm talking about? Amen.
[56:17] We have to labor to keep the world out.
[56:20] And so, as it is, this man was finally
[56:23] picked up by another ship. Amen. And
[56:25] they couldn't believe he had been out
[56:27] there all those days or all that time
[56:30] and floating in a life raft that was
[56:32] half full of water. Because after a
[56:34] while, just like Leodysia, he got tired
[56:38] of bailing the water out.
[56:42] &gt;&gt; But something kept him going because he
[56:45] knew when this raft sunk, he would be
[56:48] directly in the Atlantic or whatever
[56:50] they call the channel there and it would
[56:53] be the end. And that was just a natural
[56:55] man wanting to live. How about you and I
[56:57] sons and daughters of God with a calling
[56:59] of God in our life? Amen. Let's not give
[57:01] up and just set back. There's a higher
[57:03] calling for you and I. Amen. Let's be
[57:06] willing to receive the call. Let's be
[57:08] willing to respond to that that we can
[57:11] move forward because he hath raised us
[57:13] up together and made us sit together in
[57:16] heavenly places. And I would say today,
[57:18] thank you, Lord. I'm glad I'm here with
[57:21] you. I'm glad I'm part of this assembly.
[57:23] I'm glad I can say I'm your friend and
[57:25] your brother in Christ. And and I'm glad
[57:28] to do that because he didn't say I'll
[57:30] set you alone up, but he said he would
[57:32] set us together up. And so let's uh be
[57:35] uh bold as it is to support one another.
[57:39] Ephesians 3:9-12.
[57:42] He says here to make all men see what is
[57:45] the fellowship of the mystery which from
[57:47] the beginning of the world hath been hid
[57:49] in God who created all things by Jesus
[57:52] Christ.
[57:54] to the intent that now unto the
[57:56] principalities and powers in heavenly
[57:59] places.
[58:01] Once again, we're seeing not carnal, not
[58:03] earthly, not tradition.
[58:07] My brother and sister, the word says
[58:08] it's by their traditions they held the
[58:10] people.
[58:12] &gt;&gt; We don't want tradition. God help us
[58:15] that this church will never start
[58:16] relying that this is how we believe and
[58:19] why we believe it. It's our tradition.
[58:21] This is what we do. No, my brother and
[58:23] sister, we've been lifted up, amen, into
[58:26] heavenly places that would be known the
[58:29] manifold wisdom of God according to the
[58:32] eternal purpose which he purposed in
[58:34] Christ Jesus our Lord. In whom we have
[58:37] boldness and access with confidence by
[58:40] faith in him.
[58:42] &gt;&gt; Amen. That's what we're looking for, a
[58:43] confidence. We don't need to be
[58:45] Christians just hoping we can make it
[58:47] through this day, this week, this month.
[58:49] &gt;&gt; Amen. whatever would come in the next
[58:51] year, just hoping we can live through it
[58:53] from the influence of Leodysa, of the
[58:56] age that we're living in, the apostasy
[58:58] of our day. My brother and sister, we
[59:00] don't want to hope. Let's have a
[59:01] boldness. Amen. I pray God gives you
[59:03] revelation today to have a boldness of
[59:06] who you are that you can stand and say,
[59:08] "I made a mistake, but I'm still a son
[59:10] of God. I always was. I always will be.
[59:14] It doesn't matter what my mistake is.
[59:16] God's already gave a propitiation for
[59:18] that mistake." And the blood of Jesus
[59:20] Christ has covered it.
[59:22] &gt;&gt; Amen. Otherwise, Satan will allow you.
[59:25] He will, I say allow you, he will bring
[59:27] upon you mistake after mistake until
[59:30] you're wore down and you don't even
[59:32] believe you're a Christian. You don't
[59:33] even believe you've been called. You
[59:34] don't even believe you can go another
[59:36] day. What God wants you to come and say,
[59:38] you know what? I read the word and the
[59:40] word said, I am an overcomer. Amen. I
[59:44] will overcome. Now in uh the message
[59:48] anointed ones at the end time. Now look
[59:50] at this. We we just want to draw a
[59:52] little thought out of this. Notice the
[59:54] very day when this messenger when he
[59:56] starts on when he begins to declare his
[59:58] message. See the first poll is healing.
[1:00:01] The second pole prophesying. Third pole
[1:00:04] the opening of the word the mysteries
[1:00:07] revealed. Now my brother and sister
[1:00:10] we'll we'll just preach our way through
[1:00:12] this here. But no more. There is no more
[1:00:14] higher order to reveal the word than
[1:00:16] prophets. Scripture right there. But the
[1:00:18] only way a prophet can be vindicated is
[1:00:21] by the word. Not not by another man
[1:00:23] saying I I believe he's a prophet. But
[1:00:25] it has to be the word that shows you
[1:00:28] that there's a day coming. Amen. As we
[1:00:30] see in Malachi 4, it come and said
[1:00:32] before the great and dreadful day of the
[1:00:34] Lord. So they tried to place that
[1:00:36] scripture being back into the New
[1:00:39] Testament with John and all of them
[1:00:41] there in that time. But my brother and
[1:00:43] sister, that was not the dreadful day of
[1:00:44] the Lord. Amen. When we'll look and see
[1:00:47] in the scripture how it says in this
[1:00:49] day, a coming time in the future for us,
[1:00:52] we'll see that this earth is going to
[1:00:54] burn with a fire. Amen. That is a
[1:00:57] dreadful day. A day when people say, "I
[1:01:00] thought I was serving God to find out
[1:01:02] they served a system." Amen. They
[1:01:04] thought they had the Holy Ghost when
[1:01:05] they found out it was just an emotion.
[1:01:07] That will be a dreadful day, my brother
[1:01:09] and sister. So it says here now remember
[1:01:12] be vindicated by the word. Remember the
[1:01:14] third pull was the opening of them seven
[1:01:17] seals. Now we can go through this and we
[1:01:20] can take words and say well this looks
[1:01:22] like the seventh seal is not open. And
[1:01:25] many people believe that today. But my
[1:01:28] brother and sister I just want to just
[1:01:30] plant this thought in your mind. The
[1:01:31] seventh seal is the revelation of Jesus
[1:01:35] Christ.
[1:01:36] &gt;&gt; It is Christ himself. And if that is not
[1:01:39] open to you, then you have not met
[1:01:43] Christ.
[1:01:45] &gt;&gt; Amen. And that's what he wants you and I
[1:01:47] to do. He says, "I call all men unto
[1:01:50] me." Amen. Let's heed the call.
[1:01:53] &gt;&gt; Don't sit back and say, "I need a
[1:01:54] greater sign. I need a greater this, a
[1:01:56] greater that." Just heed the call. When
[1:01:58] he says, "I call all men." Amen. Just
[1:02:01] say, "Here I am, Lord.
[1:02:02] &gt;&gt; Amen. Send me, Lord. Let me be the one.
[1:02:05] Let me be." If no one else in this
[1:02:07] church would think that they're going to
[1:02:10] make the rapture, you need to say, "I'm
[1:02:11] going to make a rapture."
[1:02:13] &gt;&gt; Amen. Now, you're going to have a church
[1:02:15] full of people. Anybody here sitting in
[1:02:17] church, worshiping the Lord, got a
[1:02:18] prayer life, read the Bible, everything,
[1:02:20] and say, "I'm not going to make the
[1:02:21] rapture." No. When you study the word,
[1:02:23] you read the word, you pray, there's
[1:02:25] something anchored down in your heart
[1:02:27] that says, "I'm going to make the
[1:02:28] rapture." Amen. Now, if every one of us
[1:02:31] has that revelation, we walk out of here
[1:02:33] today saying, "If there's anyone in this
[1:02:35] church that's going to make the rapture,
[1:02:36] it's going to be me." Who's going to
[1:02:38] make the rapture? Every hand should go
[1:02:40] up. Every heart should respond and say,
[1:02:42] "I'm going to make the rapture." Amen.
[1:02:45] Because God's not here for us to say,
[1:02:47] "You know what? I I've got a higher
[1:02:49] position. I've got a higher this. I' i'm
[1:02:51] more important." No, my brother and
[1:02:52] sister, that isn't how God works. Amen.
[1:02:55] Every one of us with the hope of this
[1:02:57] promise should be able to say, "I'm
[1:02:58] going to make it." Amen.
[1:03:00] &gt;&gt; I'm going to be that one. Amen. So, the
[1:03:02] third poll was the opening of them seven
[1:03:04] seals to reveal the hidden truth that's
[1:03:07] been sealed in the word. Do you see it?
[1:03:09] Now, I just use that for a little
[1:03:11] reference here. If you don't mind, we'll
[1:03:13] move on here. Amen. Now, I I hope these
[1:03:17] phrases don't throw anybody. But the
[1:03:19] revealing of the word is not a
[1:03:21] completely linear event. Now, the word
[1:03:24] linear kind of has two definitions. one
[1:03:26] meaning one thing that comes right after
[1:03:29] another. So the opening of the word is
[1:03:32] linear in that context. But linear is
[1:03:35] also a straight line. And we see that
[1:03:37] the opening of the word is not a linear
[1:03:40] event because it's never an absolute
[1:03:42] straight line. It is there that my
[1:03:45] brother Trevor uh God would deal with
[1:03:47] his heart and he would see something in
[1:03:49] the word and it takes him a step up and
[1:03:52] it might be days, weeks or months before
[1:03:54] I see the same thing. and take the step
[1:03:56] up. So it's not when God opens a mystery
[1:03:59] or opens a revelation that everybody
[1:04:01] steps up together. We are all walking
[1:04:04] our own journey and God is revealing to
[1:04:07] us word by word the word which is him
[1:04:11] and we step up. Now we'll look at this.
[1:04:13] So when you think about a linear as a
[1:04:16] straight line, amen. And uh yes, things
[1:04:20] come one after another, but it is a
[1:04:23] series of events that come and God's
[1:04:26] intent was or is for us to be built up
[1:04:29] in the revelation of who he is.
[1:04:32] &gt;&gt; Now, I want to put in here right now,
[1:04:34] this is not to be a doctrine.
[1:04:38] Christ revealing himself is not a
[1:04:41] doctrine. The problem man has come and
[1:04:44] we see it all through the church ages.
[1:04:46] man has come. And the Lutheran said, and
[1:04:49] I'm not here to insult anybody, don't
[1:04:50] misunderstand, but the Lutheran said,
[1:04:53] "Hey, God spoke to us. We got it." And
[1:04:55] then they were Lutheran. And they just
[1:04:57] went on and they built around what they
[1:05:00] was revealed to them. But then God moved
[1:05:03] on, right? Isn't that what the message
[1:05:04] tells us? God moved on, but the Lutheran
[1:05:07] couldn't. They were stuck in there that
[1:05:10] God revealed this to Luther and this is
[1:05:12] the word for the day. And then it comes
[1:05:14] up Wesley and on through the ages and
[1:05:16] we'll see how they tried to make a
[1:05:19] linear movement out of it. And God said,
[1:05:21] you know what? I've got something more.
[1:05:23] I think it is something you need to see.
[1:05:26] The word would reveal it. Amen. So God's
[1:05:28] intent was for every one of us to be
[1:05:31] built up by the revelation of not who we
[1:05:34] are,
[1:05:37] &gt;&gt; but who he is.
[1:05:41] And when you get a revelation of who he
[1:05:43] is,
[1:05:44] &gt;&gt; he'll give you a revelation of who you
[1:05:46] are.
[1:05:48] &gt;&gt; If we get that backwards, we start to
[1:05:50] say, "I I'm a son of God,
[1:05:54] but we don't know the one who saved us."
[1:05:59] &gt;&gt; You can't do that.
[1:06:01] &gt;&gt; You need the revelation of knowing who
[1:06:03] saved you to recognize who you are.
[1:06:07] Amen.
[1:06:08] &gt;&gt; Amen. So, we cannot just come. Now, if
[1:06:10] you don't mind, I'll be I'll be just a
[1:06:12] little bit demonstrative here. If you,
[1:06:14] is that okay this morning? So, here we
[1:06:17] are as believers. The Lord comes. Now,
[1:06:20] we're a, you know, an audience here of
[1:06:22] different ideas and thoughts. But, you
[1:06:24] know, there was a point in our life that
[1:06:26] Jesus Christ spoke to our hearts and we
[1:06:29] started to realize, you know, I need
[1:06:30] him. My life's a mess. Anybody been
[1:06:33] there?
[1:06:34] &gt;&gt; Yeah. Amen.
[1:06:36] And so we start to move forward and
[1:06:39] maybe you just have a little something
[1:06:41] in your body that that's just not quite
[1:06:44] right. Now, we get all weird about these
[1:06:46] things, but I got rid of my weirdness
[1:06:49] about this years ago when one of the
[1:06:51] doctors I was visiting says, "You were
[1:06:53] born with a birth defect."
[1:06:55] And I'm like, "What?
[1:06:58] I think I'm perfectly perfect."
[1:07:01] And then he was joking because he says,
[1:07:03] "You know what? Your one ear is mounted
[1:07:05] like, you know, almost a quarter inch
[1:07:08] higher on your head than the other one.
[1:07:09] You have a birth defect.
[1:07:12] Okay.
[1:07:15] Well, we start to look at that and you
[1:07:16] say, you know what?
[1:07:19] I need healing.
[1:07:22] God opens the word to us and we
[1:07:23] recognize healing. I don't care where
[1:07:26] you come from and who you are. This is a
[1:07:28] promise that's in the word. Is this
[1:07:30] right?
[1:07:31] So, we're going forward in healing and
[1:07:35] we're believing
[1:07:37] and
[1:07:39] we come to a point and God says, you
[1:07:41] know, I'm your healer and there's
[1:07:42] something in us. We believe that and
[1:07:44] we'll come up to a point and if that's
[1:07:46] all we believe,
[1:07:49] we can't go any further.
[1:07:53] To go any further, what do we have to
[1:07:55] do?
[1:07:56] Step up.
[1:08:00] And that next step is the prophecy of
[1:08:03] the word.
[1:08:05] And the word's prophesying that there
[1:08:06] will be a people that will be
[1:08:08] overcomers.
[1:08:09] Anybody ever hear that prophecy before?
[1:08:12] That one ever ring in your heart, your
[1:08:14] soul. You know, I'm going to be an
[1:08:16] overcomer. That prophecy comes. There's
[1:08:18] other prophecies. We could go into all
[1:08:20] these things. There's all kinds of false
[1:08:22] prophecies out here. You know, one of
[1:08:24] them I really like is to see, and I
[1:08:26] won't name names, but to see a church
[1:08:28] built around the plan that God wants to
[1:08:30] make you rich.
[1:08:32] &gt;&gt; Praise God. Are any of you here this
[1:08:33] morning rich?
[1:08:38] &gt;&gt; Thanks for spoiling it.
[1:08:43] &gt;&gt; They're talking carnal.
[1:08:44] &gt;&gt; Right. That's right.
[1:08:45] &gt;&gt; They're talking carnal that money should
[1:08:47] disappear if you're not in a mansion and
[1:08:49] driving a Bentley. Who wants to drive a
[1:08:51] Bentley?
[1:08:54] And there might be some people who like
[1:08:56] that oldfashioned look.
[1:08:59] But you're not even saved. You don't
[1:09:02] have the Holy Ghost if you don't have
[1:09:03] cash. Just, you know, open the drawers
[1:09:06] in your kitchen, there's no utensils,
[1:09:07] it's full of cash. Go to your closet,
[1:09:09] there's no clothes, it's just cash. Oh,
[1:09:11] God's blessed me so much. No, my brother
[1:09:14] and sister.
[1:09:16] Amen. That money is a curse unless God
[1:09:20] blesses it in your life. Amen.
[1:09:22] &gt;&gt; Plain and simple.
[1:09:24] &gt;&gt; Now, don't misunderstand me. If God
[1:09:26] blesses you with a good job and you have
[1:09:28] good stewardship of that and over time
[1:09:30] you accumulate some standard of of uh uh
[1:09:34] what word should we use? I don't want to
[1:09:36] sound carnal, but I guess wealth,
[1:09:39] you know. Yeah, you you've collected a a
[1:09:42] higher degree of filthy lucer than the
[1:09:44] next person.
[1:09:46] But look at this, my brother and sister.
[1:09:48] There's nothing wrong with that as long
[1:09:49] as you have approached it correctly,
[1:09:51] right? And it didn't distract your life.
[1:09:54] Being uh well off is is not a sin. Amen.
[1:09:57] But God does have a higher calling on
[1:09:59] your life if you have it. Just like the
[1:10:01] rich young ruler. Amen. As the painting
[1:10:04] uh uh is there of the, you know, the
[1:10:06] Hoffman's head and you see that full
[1:10:08] painting and Lazarus is in the
[1:10:10] background and the rich young ruler is
[1:10:12] saying, "I've done all of this since my
[1:10:14] youth." But you see, he only saw the
[1:10:16] surface of what the word was because the
[1:10:19] word had come. And if he had really had
[1:10:21] a revelation of what Jesus was saying to
[1:10:23] him, Lazarus wouldn't be in the
[1:10:25] background in rags in the gutter.
[1:10:28] &gt;&gt; He'd had compassion in his heart. He'd
[1:10:30] have said, "You know what? I can do
[1:10:32] something for my brother."
[1:10:34] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:10:36] &gt;&gt; Are you with me? Yeah.
[1:10:38] &gt;&gt; So in that second step there, that
[1:10:41] prophecy coming forth, that prophecy is
[1:10:44] not just saying the end of the world is
[1:10:45] like this and that's going to happen.
[1:10:47] The prophecy is the opening of the word
[1:10:50] and God saying this is what's going to
[1:10:52] happen. So we could take this and let me
[1:10:54] just not get distracted. Amen. Uh we we
[1:10:58] can look at this and and these events
[1:11:00] coming. Amen. So it builds us up. Amen.
[1:11:05] that God intended for us to have a
[1:11:07] revelation of him. That's what the
[1:11:10] revelation is, my brother and sister.
[1:11:12] The revelation is not all deep
[1:11:14] mysteries. Revelation is not doctrine.
[1:11:17] Revelation is relationship.
[1:11:20] &gt;&gt; Amen. God has given to you and I so many
[1:11:24] revelations that we do not fathom. We're
[1:11:27] looking for the big one. We're looking
[1:11:29] for the big thing. We're looking for the
[1:11:31] latest thing. And God is revealing
[1:11:33] himself day after day. That's what
[1:11:35] revelation is, right? God revealing
[1:11:37] himself to us.
[1:11:39] &gt;&gt; That's real revelation. I want to ask
[1:11:41] you, did you have a revelation
[1:11:42] yesterday?
[1:11:44] &gt;&gt; Did you have one last week? Amen. Are we
[1:11:46] having one here today? Amen. Christ
[1:11:49] revealing himself to us. It's not, oh,
[1:11:52] I've got a revelation. This will happen
[1:11:54] at this day, this time, in this way.
[1:11:56] Person will be dressed like this. I have
[1:11:58] prophecies of this and this. No, my
[1:12:00] brother and sister, I don't want to see
[1:12:02] the man out here who is telling you,
[1:12:04] "God told me to tell you to give money
[1:12:07] because I am going to own a $62 million
[1:12:11] le jet."
[1:12:13] And they call that prophecy. What's that
[1:12:16] got to do with bringing that person
[1:12:18] closer to Christ?
[1:12:21] Nothing. That's carnal impersonation of
[1:12:24] what revelation and prophecy is.
[1:12:27] &gt;&gt; Amen. The whole thing is calling us
[1:12:29] closer to him. As the Apostle Paul said,
[1:12:32] calling us into higher places.
[1:12:35] Now, as we'll look at this, see, we're
[1:12:38] being built up in a revelation of who he
[1:12:40] is and of who we are. Can someone say
[1:12:44] you've got revelation?
[1:12:45] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:12:46] &gt;&gt; I I I hope every one of us here this
[1:12:48] morning can say, "I've got revelation of
[1:12:50] who he is and who I am in him."
[1:12:53] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:12:54] So without revelation,
[1:12:58] if you just see yourself as some person
[1:12:59] placed on the earth hoping to overcome,
[1:13:02] hoping to do this, recognize my
[1:13:04] failures, you'll never have spiritual
[1:13:06] growth.
[1:13:07] &gt;&gt; It's only when you have a revelation of
[1:13:10] who you are in Jesus Christ, can you
[1:13:12] have real spiritual growth. It's not
[1:13:15] about shivers. It's not about dancing.
[1:13:18] It's not about screaming, jumping,
[1:13:20] running. None of those things, every one
[1:13:22] of those can be imitated and they are
[1:13:25] imitated. But I tell you, when you get a
[1:13:27] real revelation of who Jesus Christ is
[1:13:29] in your life, Amen. the devil cannot
[1:13:32] imitate that. Amen. When you come to a
[1:13:35] place that you are overcoming the world
[1:13:38] and your life is changing by degree by
[1:13:40] degree by degree. Amen. Satan cannot
[1:13:44] imitate that because you'll come to the
[1:13:47] place that it's a direct contradiction
[1:13:49] of what Satan believes. Amen. Satan's
[1:13:51] doctrine and the doctrine of Jesus
[1:13:53] Christ. Amen. They cannot coexist in the
[1:13:56] same sphere. They cannot live in the
[1:13:58] same atmosphere. They cannot dwell in
[1:14:01] the same house. Bitter water cannot come
[1:14:04] out with sweet water. Amen. And so when
[1:14:06] the word is there, Satan realizes, I
[1:14:09] cannot imitate that life. Now he
[1:14:12] imitates religion.
[1:14:14] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:14:14] &gt;&gt; He imitates these things that we call
[1:14:17] Christianity. But when real
[1:14:19] Christianity, a real relationship with
[1:14:21] Jesus Christ is there and it's in
[1:14:24] action. Amen. Acts coming in action.
[1:14:28] Amen. Satan cannot imitate the life.
[1:14:31] Amen.
[1:14:34] &gt;&gt; Am I preaching to the choir this
[1:14:36] morning?
[1:14:37] &gt;&gt; Go ahead, say, "Amen."
[1:14:42] &gt;&gt; Who's willing to sit here this morning
[1:14:43] and say, "I'm willing to put up with
[1:14:45] just limited spiritual growth."
[1:14:48] &gt;&gt; No, sir. I want revelation that comes
[1:14:51] straight from the throne of Almighty
[1:14:53] God.
[1:14:54] &gt;&gt; No. Let's not turn this revelation into
[1:14:56] a doctrine where my revelation's bigger
[1:14:58] than your revelation and you have to see
[1:15:00] it my way. My brother and sister, it's
[1:15:03] not a doctrine. It's a life.
[1:15:06] &gt;&gt; Amen. Whether it's the opening of the
[1:15:08] seals or whether it's the opening of
[1:15:10] recognizing the church ages and all
[1:15:13] these, you know, all these different
[1:15:14] deals of vials and all that. My brother
[1:15:16] and sister, people say, "I got a
[1:15:18] revelation." My brother and sister, let
[1:15:20] me just tone this down for you. If
[1:15:22] you're in Christ and he promised to lead
[1:15:24] you to truth, it's not a man's
[1:15:26] revelation that brings you into that.
[1:15:29] It's God pouring himself down into you
[1:15:32] to show you a little bit more. Now, I
[1:15:35] tell you how it is. I'll tell you really
[1:15:37] how it is. I've been married for 42
[1:15:40] years. My wife is still a mystery.
[1:15:46] I should actually hear some brothers
[1:15:48] saying, "Amen."
[1:15:49] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:15:52] and they'll remain a mystery. But the
[1:15:54] longer you're married, the more
[1:15:57] revelation there is.
[1:16:01] &gt;&gt; I should hear an amen about then.
[1:16:04] &gt;&gt; Is that an okay analogy?
[1:16:07] &gt;&gt; See, at the point you marry that girl,
[1:16:09] all you see is this beautiful eyes, and
[1:16:12] you know, you're just transfixed. And
[1:16:14] I'll tell you how bad it can be. I
[1:16:16] didn't even realize Sister Jerry was
[1:16:17] left-handed until we were already
[1:16:19] married.
[1:16:20] I walked around in a days like, "Oh,
[1:16:23] this is the girl." You're left-handed.
[1:16:27] I've always been left-handed.
[1:16:30] Oh, this is a revelation.
[1:16:34] My brother and sister, we can go to
[1:16:36] church all the days of our life and
[1:16:38] Christ never be revealed to us.
[1:16:41] &gt;&gt; We're not there entering into his
[1:16:44] presence. We're entering into the
[1:16:45] atmosphere of our church. We're into,
[1:16:48] oh, we have to learn this. We have to do
[1:16:51] this. We have to do this. No, you have
[1:16:53] to have a personal relationship with
[1:16:56] Jesus Christ. And in that personal
[1:16:59] relationship, every day goes by, he's
[1:17:02] going to show you a little bit more of
[1:17:05] himself. It's not, I went to church. Oh,
[1:17:08] great meeting. Praise God. I got the
[1:17:09] revelation of Jesus Christ. Somebody's
[1:17:12] lying to you, my brother and sister. The
[1:17:14] revelation of Jesus Christ is there and
[1:17:17] it's coming and it's not linear because
[1:17:19] as it comes to the place as the prophet
[1:17:22] of God in this quote says now that the
[1:17:24] opening of the third pole was the
[1:17:26] opening of them seven seals which is
[1:17:28] Christ revealed in his word and my
[1:17:31] brother and sister this level right here
[1:17:33] that God promised to heal me and this
[1:17:36] level right here that God has showed us
[1:17:38] through prophecy but there comes a time
[1:17:40] you got to step up into a higher place
[1:17:43] for God to come and really show you who
[1:17:46] he is. Now, I don't want to sound vulgar
[1:17:49] or offbeat here, but my brother and
[1:17:51] sister, the word clearly shows us in our
[1:17:53] relationship as men with women, women
[1:17:55] with men, we don't go out here and test
[1:17:58] drive a wife before we marry her.
[1:18:01] &gt;&gt; Amen. That's not what God wants. God
[1:18:03] wants us to follow his word. And it's
[1:18:07] there in that that marriage then becomes
[1:18:10] a very clear type of our spiritual walk
[1:18:13] that as every day goes by this woman
[1:18:15] that you have fallen in love with is
[1:18:17] revealed a little bit more to you and we
[1:18:20] are the bride of Christ and he said I
[1:18:23] will open my word and reveal myself to
[1:18:27] you.
[1:18:28] &gt;&gt; Amen. He's not doing it to a
[1:18:30] denomination. He never promised to give
[1:18:32] it to the denomination. He promised to
[1:18:33] give it to you personal. Amen.
[1:18:36] &gt;&gt; Amen. We ought to pursue it as he
[1:18:38] promised to give it to me personal.
[1:18:40] &gt;&gt; Amen. He didn't say, "I'm just going to
[1:18:42] go round up people off the street and
[1:18:44] reveal myself to them." He said, "I have
[1:18:46] a chosen people, a predestinated people,
[1:18:49] and I chose them in myself."
[1:18:53] &gt;&gt; Amen. That's why we should never view
[1:18:56] that opening of the seven seals
[1:19:00] of the pools
[1:19:03] as doctrine.
[1:19:07] &gt;&gt; Because the minute we make doctrine out
[1:19:09] of it, we're defining that everybody
[1:19:12] needs to see it like I see it.
[1:19:17] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:19:19] God never said, "I'm going to make you a
[1:19:21] bunch
[1:19:23] &gt;&gt; of repeaters." Parrots,
[1:19:26] &gt;&gt; you know, even parrots don't all look
[1:19:29] alike,
[1:19:31] right?
[1:19:31] &gt;&gt; You know, I used to do a pretty good
[1:19:33] imitation when I was a kid. People would
[1:19:36] call me just drove me nuts as a kid.
[1:19:38] Please don't don't do this.
[1:19:41] But as a kid, I'd get on the school bus
[1:19:43] and there was a girl on the school bus.
[1:19:45] Good morning, Polly.
[1:19:51] She doesn't exist.
[1:19:55] Why won't you talk to me, Paulie?
[1:19:59] Because you're calling me Paulie.
[1:20:02] But, you know, after a while, I'm trying
[1:20:03] to cope. And
[1:20:06] Paulie wants a cracker.
[1:20:09] I decided if I couldn't beat him, I'd
[1:20:11] join him. That girl would be, "Good
[1:20:13] morning, Paulie.
[1:20:15] And Paulie would say, "Polly doesn't say
[1:20:18] good morning."
[1:20:24] Were we called to be parrots?
[1:20:27] Let this word of God be a revelation
[1:20:30] that is just to you, not for us to raise
[1:20:34] up and say, "I got more than you got."
[1:20:35] Maybe you do at the moment, but God
[1:20:37] promised he'd lead me to truth.
[1:20:39] &gt;&gt; He promised he'd lead you to truth. So,
[1:20:41] we're not here to say, "Hey, I've got
[1:20:43] more than you've got." That's not what
[1:20:45] it's about. What we need is him.
[1:20:48] &gt;&gt; Amen. And if you have a greater portion,
[1:20:50] praise God. But he promised I would have
[1:20:52] a portion that was necessary for me to
[1:20:54] make a rapture. Amen. I don't need to
[1:20:56] have your portion as long as I've got
[1:20:58] the portion that was allotted to me.
[1:21:01] &gt;&gt; Amen. And when God allotss us to us, he
[1:21:03] didn't allott it to us that we would
[1:21:04] fail or come short. He allotted us
[1:21:07] everything we need to finish this race.
[1:21:10] and hear those words, well done,
[1:21:13] &gt;&gt; my good and faithful servant.
[1:21:15] &gt;&gt; Amen. You see, if we don't have that,
[1:21:18] what it ends up is we listen. Now, it
[1:21:22] was wonderful there in Netherlands.
[1:21:26] Brother Barry, such a articulate man.
[1:21:30] Just lays things out. Lays it out very
[1:21:33] well. Puts all the pieces of the puzzle
[1:21:35] together so precisely. Doesn't slobber.
[1:21:38] Doesn't drool. Doesn't have to yell.
[1:21:41] That's with us that don't have quite
[1:21:43] that ability have to do. Amen. But he
[1:21:46] laid it out.
[1:21:49] Did everyone in the building catch it
[1:21:52] because he laid it out so precisely?
[1:21:55] No,
[1:21:58] it doesn't do any good. I listen to the
[1:22:00] best. Our pastor's the best.
[1:22:05] I didn't even get an amen out of that.
[1:22:10] It doesn't matter how good your pastor
[1:22:12] is.
[1:22:13] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:22:14] &gt;&gt; It matters God speaking to you.
[1:22:18] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:22:19] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:22:20] Isn't that we we use pastors, we use
[1:22:23] churches, we use all of this stuff. It's
[1:22:25] giant crutches.
[1:22:26] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:22:27] &gt;&gt; When God says, "I I don't need you to go
[1:22:29] to the best church, the most beautiful
[1:22:31] church, the biggest church, the best
[1:22:32] choir, the best this, the best that. I
[1:22:34] need you to have a relationship with me.
[1:22:37] &gt;&gt; And don't let that relationship become
[1:22:39] something that's just in your head."
[1:22:42] Amen. He head knowledge, intellectual. I
[1:22:45] I I you know, I have a silly analogy I
[1:22:47] want to present to you, my brothers and
[1:22:49] sisters. Here you are. You've been in an
[1:22:51] accident and you're laying on the side
[1:22:53] of the road and and somebody pulls up,
[1:22:56] gets out of the car. You're laying
[1:22:57] there. Let's just say you wrecked
[1:22:58] horribly on your bicycle. Amen. And and
[1:23:01] you're laying there and you're bleeding
[1:23:02] and and uh and they get out of the car
[1:23:05] and they come over to you and your
[1:23:07] life's blood is running out on the
[1:23:08] asphalt
[1:23:11] and they crouch down beside you.
[1:23:14] Did you know that the blood carries
[1:23:17] oxygen to your cells and without oxygen
[1:23:21] your cells die? And did you know that
[1:23:24] the blood carries all these things and
[1:23:27] they start going through this whole
[1:23:28] thing of what the blood is? In the
[1:23:30] meantime, your heart's pumping and your
[1:23:32] blood is running out on the ground,
[1:23:34] &gt;&gt; right?
[1:23:35] &gt;&gt; And so the blood is this and the blood
[1:23:37] is that and this is how the blood works.
[1:23:39] And this mic's going to die.
[1:23:41] Amen.
[1:23:43] Hallelujah. I'm just tired of talking.
[1:24:18] and we have many people laying in church
[1:24:20] today, sitting in church today, my
[1:24:22] brother and sister, that we've given
[1:24:24] them such an intellectual understanding
[1:24:26] of what the word of God is. They don't
[1:24:29] need an intellectual understanding of
[1:24:31] what the word of God is. They need an
[1:24:34] encounter with the blood.
[1:24:37] &gt;&gt; They need to HAVE THE BLOOD PUT IN THEM.
[1:24:40] And when THEY HAVE THE BLOOD IN THEM, MY
[1:24:43] BROTHER AND SISTER, THEY'LL have life.
[1:24:46] &gt;&gt; But a book, a page, a a a explanation
[1:24:50] that won't give them life. You can TELL
[1:24:52] THEM ON THIS MEDICAL ENCYCLOPEDIA, THIS
[1:24:55] SAYS THAT THIS IS LIFE. BLOOD DOES THIS.
[1:24:59] BUT MY BROTHER AND SISTER, IF IT'S STILL
[1:25:01] ON THE PAGE, THEY'LL LAY THERE ON THE
[1:25:03] SIDE OF THAT ROAD AND BLEED TO death
[1:25:06] &gt;&gt; and life will slowly leave their body.
[1:25:09] LET US NOT MAKE this word OF GOD SOME
[1:25:12] KIND OF A DOGMA, some kind of a creed
[1:25:15] that we do, BUT LET IT BE LIFE to us.
[1:25:19] &gt;&gt; Amen. I'm telling you, I it might offend
[1:25:21] some of you this morning, but I'm
[1:25:23] telling you, WE GOT TO GET OVER THE IDEA
[1:25:26] THAT, OH, WE BELIEVE THE MESSAGE OF THE
[1:25:28] HOUR. WE'RE OKAY. NO, YOU NEED TO KNOW
[1:25:31] JESUS CHRIST. THAT'S WHAT WE NEED. IT'S
[1:25:34] NOT TO HAVE BOOKS AND TAPES AND
[1:25:36] ACKNOWLEDGE GOD SENT A PROPHET IN THIS
[1:25:39] GENERATION. IT'S HAVING CHRIST IN YOU,
[1:25:42] THE BLOOD APPLIED IN YOU BRINGS you
[1:25:46] life.
[1:25:47] &gt;&gt; Amen. And we can hold on to ideology,
[1:25:50] MAKE A DOCTRINE, A DOGMA OUT OF IT, AND
[1:25:53] go straight to hell if that's not too
[1:25:55] strong for you.
[1:25:57] &gt;&gt; God help us.
[1:26:00] &gt;&gt; Now look, look what intellectual
[1:26:02] revelation will do.
[1:26:05] How do you feel about the Tower of
[1:26:06] Babel?
[1:26:11] Was the Tower of Babel false doctrine?
[1:26:15] Think about it before you answer.
[1:26:20] I'm here to tell you the Tower of Babel
[1:26:22] was not false doctrine.
[1:26:25] It was a revelation misapplied.
[1:26:29] Man had inspiration that he had a
[1:26:31] longing, a desire to rise into heavenly
[1:26:35] places.
[1:26:37] But it got twisted. It got taught wrong.
[1:26:40] It got put to them. We can do this.
[1:26:44] &gt;&gt; We can do this. We don't need to have a
[1:26:47] relationship with Jesus Christ to get
[1:26:50] into heavenly places. We can build our
[1:26:53] own.
[1:26:56] &gt;&gt; Did you know you can be a one person
[1:26:58] denomination?
[1:27:01] &gt;&gt; We can build our own idea thinking
[1:27:05] &gt;&gt; I can get into heavenly places my way.
[1:27:10] &gt;&gt; You know what's scary?
[1:27:13] somebody, you know, crazy crazy idea,
[1:27:15] just way off, and you say, "Oh, that's
[1:27:18] that's that's false. That's false
[1:27:19] doctrine."
[1:27:22] But you know what's scarier than false
[1:27:24] doctrine
[1:27:25] is having the truth misapplied.
[1:27:29] &gt;&gt; That's exactly right.
[1:27:37] One of the greatest challenges of our
[1:27:38] day
[1:27:40] is deception hidden in truth.
[1:27:45] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:27:48] &gt;&gt; Now, you guys know I'm I'm a little
[1:27:51] weird about this and I'm sorry. Don't
[1:27:53] want to but I I go and I listen to
[1:27:56] different points of view
[1:27:59] and I don't really encourage you to do
[1:28:01] that. It's your decision if you want.
[1:28:05] But when you hear people saying, "Now,
[1:28:07] if you've heard my voice this morning,
[1:28:10] you have the Holy Ghost."
[1:28:16] &gt;&gt; You know, there's a truth to that.
[1:28:22] &gt;&gt; If you hear the voice,
[1:28:25] &gt;&gt; whose voice? That's it.
[1:28:30] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:28:32] &gt;&gt; It all depends on what voice you're
[1:28:34] listening to.
[1:28:35] &gt;&gt; So, you can't say, you know what, I'm
[1:28:37] not going to listen to any voices
[1:28:39] because there's a voice out there that
[1:28:40] wants to speak to you. And when that
[1:28:43] voice speaks to you and you realize
[1:28:44] where that voice come from, amen, we'll
[1:28:48] see through this scripture, right? The
[1:28:49] blood speaking.
[1:28:51] &gt;&gt; Cain and Abel.
[1:28:53] &gt;&gt; What was it? Oh, it'd be imagine Cain.
[1:28:55] He's sitting there thinking now how how
[1:28:57] did he know? And he said, "Your
[1:28:59] brother's blood crith
[1:29:01] &gt;&gt; from the earth. Spaketh from the earth."
[1:29:05] &gt;&gt; Amen. A scriptural example that the
[1:29:09] blood has a voice.
[1:29:11] And Christ Jesus is here today, my
[1:29:13] brother and sister, through the voice
[1:29:14] speaking to you and I. Oh Lord, help us
[1:29:17] to hear him. Amen. Amen. But look at
[1:29:20] this. Back to the Tower of Babel. See,
[1:29:22] not entirely a false thing. Man had no
[1:29:25] revelation of what God was calling them
[1:29:27] to do. Thought it was something that
[1:29:29] they could do. Maybe they caught a
[1:29:31] little glimpse of the word. Maybe
[1:29:33] somehow they had a little revelation of
[1:29:34] rising into heavenly places and said,
[1:29:37] "We can do this. I can do this."
[1:29:40] &gt;&gt; But I'm here to tell you, you can't do
[1:29:42] it. Amen. It's a gift from God in you
[1:29:46] that allows you to rise into heavenly
[1:29:48] places. It is not what we ourselves can
[1:29:50] do. I've been a Christian all my life,
[1:29:52] my brother and sister. I've seen men,
[1:29:54] and I'm not speaking ill of them. They
[1:29:56] were fine men, but they've their whole
[1:29:58] life, I've been a Christian my whole
[1:30:00] life, have a temper like a buzzsaw.
[1:30:06] &gt;&gt; Smash their hand and speak words that
[1:30:08] are unre repeatable and say, "I have the
[1:30:11] Holy Ghost." I'm here to tell you, this
[1:30:13] flesh will always be a pain to you, BUT
[1:30:16] THIS FLESH will become subject to the
[1:30:18] word of God. Amen. in the word of God
[1:30:21] will not speak bitter water out of a
[1:30:24] fountain that should have sweet water
[1:30:25] coming from it.
[1:30:27] &gt;&gt; Amen. And so we're there. What is the
[1:30:29] revelation that we have there?
[1:30:33] A man's revelation
[1:30:35] intellectual.
[1:30:46] Pardon me. I'm just filtering through a
[1:30:47] whole bunch of thoughts.
[1:30:50] For those of you computer oriented, just
[1:30:52] look at this.
[1:31:01] We think that trying to get in heavenly
[1:31:03] places looking back as I presented to
[1:31:06] you, the Tower of Babel.
[1:31:09] But do you realize that that's taking
[1:31:11] place today?
[1:31:12] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:31:15] &gt;&gt; You want to move forward. You want to
[1:31:17] serve God. you have a desire in your
[1:31:19] heart,
[1:31:21] make sure you have the Holy Ghost.
[1:31:23] That's right.
[1:31:23] &gt;&gt; Make sure you're obeying the word. Amen.
[1:31:26] And when you obey the word, God promised
[1:31:28] that he would lead you and guide you.
[1:31:31] &gt;&gt; And it's at that point, it's no longer
[1:31:33] what I can do. It's no longer what you
[1:31:36] can do.
[1:31:37] &gt;&gt; It's what he's doing in us
[1:31:39] &gt;&gt; that matters.
[1:31:41] And when we come to the place, we can
[1:31:43] see some really supernatural things. Let
[1:31:46] me boast upon the Holy Ghost for just a
[1:31:48] moment. Amen. We're over there in Europe
[1:31:51] and and uh I I preached to the church
[1:31:53] there and I I walked away from the
[1:31:56] service feeling like I had been a
[1:31:57] shotgun. Hit here and I hit there and I
[1:32:00] hit over here and I'm I'm thinking I got
[1:32:03] to get back to my notes. I try to get
[1:32:04] back to my notes and I just seemingly
[1:32:07] just once again and I get all done and
[1:32:09] the pastor was translating the service
[1:32:12] and we get in the back room and he says,
[1:32:14] "Man, Paul, that was amazing." I'm like,
[1:32:19] "Brother David, what's your definition
[1:32:21] of amazing?
[1:32:23] I shot over here and I didn't get a
[1:32:25] bird. I shot over here, didn't hit
[1:32:27] anything. Shot over here, didn't get
[1:32:28] nothing." He said, "You preached the
[1:32:31] foundation of every service I've
[1:32:33] preached in the last few weeks. You hid
[1:32:36] it."
[1:32:38] Oh,
[1:32:40] you mean it wasn't a disaster? Oh, no. I
[1:32:43] think the Lord ordained you to speak
[1:32:45] that. It reinforced everything I've been
[1:32:47] speaking to the church. Oh,
[1:32:51] okay.
[1:32:52] Okay. You mean I I just didn't totally
[1:32:55] wreck it? No, it was good.
[1:32:59] You see where we're at, saints? In man,
[1:33:03] we're thinking, "Oh, this is what I'm
[1:33:04] going to preach." God drags you off your
[1:33:07] notes and you talk about this, you talk
[1:33:09] about this, you talk about this, you
[1:33:10] talk about this. And in a man's mind, we
[1:33:13] think, "I messed up. What's wrong with
[1:33:16] me? I'm literally in the pulpit saying,
[1:33:18] "Lord, did I totally miss it while I was
[1:33:20] studying?"
[1:33:24] But then you realize
[1:33:27] sister comes to you after the service,
[1:33:29] shakes your hand. I've been reading that
[1:33:32] scripture, brother Paul.
[1:33:49] You think I should have I should have
[1:33:51] just said, "Yeah, praise God. I'm such a
[1:33:54] good preacher."
[1:33:56] I spent two days struggling.
[1:33:58] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:33:58] &gt;&gt; With Why couldn't I have just
[1:34:02] spoke that and knew what I was doing?
[1:34:06] But you see, the word never said Paul
[1:34:09] will lead you and guide you into all
[1:34:12] truth.
[1:34:13] &gt;&gt; Paul will do this. Paul will do that.
[1:34:17] &gt;&gt; Now, let me, speaking of Paul, let me go
[1:34:19] on and touch this before we dismiss.
[1:34:21] Amen. Hallelujah.
[1:34:26] Because I'm probably already late. Oh,
[1:34:29] right on the dot. So, I've got I've got
[1:34:31] a few more minutes. So, look at this.
[1:34:35] You see, as we'll look at this, we'll
[1:34:39] find in 2 Corinthians 12:7,
[1:34:43] we'll find that the Apostle Paul says,
[1:34:46] uh, "Lest I should be exalted above
[1:34:49] measure through the abundance of the
[1:34:51] revelations,
[1:34:54] &gt;&gt; there was given to me a thorn in the
[1:34:57] flesh."
[1:34:58] &gt;&gt; So now, can we interpret this?
[1:35:02] Paul is saying, "The things that God
[1:35:03] showed me put me right here in heavenly
[1:35:06] places." It was so far above what
[1:35:09] anybody else around me. Right? Remember
[1:35:12] Paul had his issues with Peter.
[1:35:15] &gt;&gt; Peter was saying, "You went outside the
[1:35:17] boundaries. What you're preaching about,
[1:35:19] buddy. You're way out there." And then
[1:35:21] Paul had to come and show Peter this
[1:35:23] wasn't me. This was him.
[1:35:28] And he says, "Unless I would be lifted
[1:35:30] up from the abundance of the
[1:35:33] revelations."
[1:35:34] Now, my brother and sister, I want you
[1:35:36] to catch this.
[1:35:39] What Paul received as revelation
[1:35:44] has every bit of it been revealed to
[1:35:47] you?
[1:35:52] Are you getting it?
[1:35:54] You guys are looking at me like, "What's
[1:35:56] that got to do with anything?
[1:35:59] I got a trigonometry test this next
[1:36:02] week, and what's that got to do with
[1:36:03] it?"
[1:36:08] Everything that was a supernatural
[1:36:10] revelation to Paul has been revealed to
[1:36:14] his bride, bride of Christ.
[1:36:18] Do you sit here today and go, "Oh my, I
[1:36:21] feel so lifted up because this has been
[1:36:23] revealed to me."
[1:36:25] Some do.
[1:36:28] And if you do, God will put a thorn in
[1:36:30] your flesh.
[1:36:32] But what we see the opening of the word
[1:36:34] as the Apostle Paul, it was revealed to
[1:36:36] him in that day. And he says the
[1:36:39] abundance of the revelations. I want to
[1:36:42] just ask you today, how many of you have
[1:36:44] an abundance of revelation that's been
[1:36:46] revealed to you?
[1:36:48] &gt;&gt; I would hope every hand in this building
[1:36:50] would be raised and say, I can count
[1:36:53] everything from the day the Lord got a
[1:36:55] hold of my heart to where I stand today.
[1:36:58] Abundance. It is not what we think.
[1:37:00] We're thinking big, deep things that are
[1:37:03] there on the marqu and the lights
[1:37:04] flashing. My brother and sister, when
[1:37:06] you wake up and realize that you can
[1:37:09] control the atmosphere around you by the
[1:37:11] words that you speak and what you
[1:37:13] believe. Amen. That's a revelation. When
[1:37:16] you realize that you as a son or
[1:37:18] daughter of God can many times we'll see
[1:37:21] mothers I this has been a personal
[1:37:23] experience to me. A sister called me up
[1:37:25] one time and says, "Oh, my little girl's
[1:37:27] got a fever. It's very hot." She said,
[1:37:29] "I'm not sure if my thermometer is
[1:37:31] right, but if it is, my baby girl has
[1:37:33] 107 uh fever." Now, we we know what 107
[1:37:38] fever is. That's brain damage.
[1:37:40] &gt;&gt; And I said, "Sister, I can't come and
[1:37:43] lay my hands on your baby, but you can
[1:37:45] stand there as a daughter of God and lay
[1:37:49] your hands on that baby and say, "Lord,
[1:37:53] you said
[1:37:55] &gt;&gt; the sister let me know later." She said,
[1:37:57] "I I went in there and I laid my hands
[1:37:59] on my little girl and I prayed and in 40
[1:38:02] minutes she was up playing with toys in
[1:38:05] the room."
[1:38:06] &gt;&gt; My brother and sister, there's a
[1:38:08] revelation that's been expressed. Amen.
[1:38:10] That the word is true. Amen. What we
[1:38:13] will follow if we'll follow the word and
[1:38:15] God will do that. Read your own Bible.
[1:38:17] Tell me how many times you've read your
[1:38:18] Bible. Something leaped off the page and
[1:38:21] you said, "I never saw that before."
[1:38:23] That's revelation in action. Amen. Not
[1:38:26] huge firecrackers going off, you know,
[1:38:29] not a band playing. It's God speaking to
[1:38:31] you. Amen. By the abundance of the
[1:38:34] revelation
[1:38:36] of Christ expressing himself to you.
[1:38:40] &gt;&gt; It's not about us raising men up.
[1:38:44] Now, I hope this don't sound too harsh,
[1:38:48] but why is it in the denominations of
[1:38:50] the age,
[1:38:52] the higher the position that people are
[1:38:54] put in,
[1:38:56] the finer the robes they want to wrap
[1:38:59] around that person.
[1:39:06] Even on a Saturday afternoon, you don't
[1:39:08] find a priest in blue jeans.
[1:39:11] Their church requires them to go out
[1:39:14] presented in a certain fashion of their
[1:39:17] office.
[1:39:19] Don't you ever try to put that on me.
[1:39:22] &gt;&gt; I'm sorry.
[1:39:24] God walks around in blue jeans.
[1:39:28] &gt;&gt; But you see, my brother and sister, what
[1:39:29] are they doing? By man's ideas, we're
[1:39:31] reaping heaping honor on these people by
[1:39:35] dressing them in these fine linens and
[1:39:38] all of this stuff. What are they trying
[1:39:39] to do? They're trying to imitate what
[1:39:42] the word says in Revelations 19. Amen.
[1:39:46] That this bride is clothed in the
[1:39:48] righteousness of Christ. That's the fine
[1:39:51] linen. Amen. Not some expensive dress or
[1:39:55] suit or whatever. The revelation that
[1:39:57] God has come and brought to you and I in
[1:39:59] this hour is the fine linen of God's
[1:40:02] word. He's dressing us in his
[1:40:04] righteousness. It's coming out of the
[1:40:07] word to you and I. It's not an external
[1:40:09] cloth that we wear. Amen. It's what our
[1:40:12] heart is clothed in. It's what our heart
[1:40:14] is wrapped in. That is the revelation
[1:40:16] God wants you and I to see today is it's
[1:40:19] not the external man. Even though what's
[1:40:22] on the inside will come to the outside.
[1:40:24] Amen. What you claim in your heart will
[1:40:27] appear on the outside, good or evil.
[1:40:29] Amen. But you look at this and realize
[1:40:31] God's wrapping his righteousness not
[1:40:33] around old filthy flesh. He's wrapping
[1:40:36] it around the soul of sons and daughters
[1:40:39] of God that he has predestinated from
[1:40:41] the beginning.
[1:40:43] And we walk and we will come to many
[1:40:46] plateaus in our life. Not a simple one
[1:40:48] or two steps, but you'll come to a place
[1:40:50] in your life.
[1:40:53] And God will reveal something to you and
[1:40:55] then you'll hear something in your soul
[1:40:56] say, "Step up a little higher.
[1:41:00] Come to the high calling
[1:41:02] &gt;&gt; in Christ Jesus."
[1:41:04] As long as we're just walking, praise
[1:41:06] God, I'm a believer. I'm a Christian.
[1:41:08] And you just walk. The flesh never
[1:41:10] changes. The attitude never changes. The
[1:41:12] atmosphere never changes. But I'm a
[1:41:14] Christian. No, you can't change until
[1:41:18] you step up a little higher.
[1:41:22] And as you step up higher into his
[1:41:24] presence, he will prepare you. This is
[1:41:28] something that I really, really
[1:41:29] appreciated.
[1:41:31] There was a little song and whatnot that
[1:41:33] was sung there
[1:41:35] in America.
[1:41:40] God doesn't call
[1:41:43] the qualified.
[1:41:45] He qualifies the called.
[1:41:49] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:41:50] &gt;&gt; Don't think you can do it yourself.
[1:41:53] Let God
[1:41:55] &gt;&gt; make you qualified.
[1:41:58] And when you let him qualify you, you
[1:42:00] can walk in a boldness. Sister Ruth, if
[1:42:02] you'd come, you can walk in a boldness
[1:42:05] because he has revealed who you are.
[1:42:09] Not a story about what the blood can do.
[1:42:14] The blood can cleanse you. That's what
[1:42:16] the scripture says. Until it becomes
[1:42:19] real to you, you will have bitterness in
[1:42:23] your heart towards brothers and sisters.
[1:42:26] You will have manifestations of things
[1:42:29] that are not God's word. When he has
[1:42:32] washed you in his blood,
[1:42:36] it changes our life entirely.
[1:42:40] Amen. When we open up and allow him into
[1:42:42] our soul,
[1:42:44] it changes our life entirely.
[1:42:49] Who would like to be changed today?
[1:42:52] &gt;&gt; Amen. We're not sitting here saying
[1:42:53] you're sinners. No, don't misunderstand
[1:42:56] me. I'm not trying to make anyone feel
[1:42:58] like they're a sinner. I'm just telling
[1:43:00] you there's a higher calling. There's a
[1:43:03] higher place for us to rise up to. If
[1:43:06] you're in your church and your church is
[1:43:08] your absolute,
[1:43:10] there's only so high you can rise. But
[1:43:13] when Jesus Christ is your absolute, the
[1:43:15] word is your absolute, there's nothing
[1:43:19] going to stop you till you've risen to
[1:43:22] his level. Amen. And who wants to rise
[1:43:24] up to the level of our Lord Jesus
[1:43:26] Christ? Amen. Let's just stand. Amen.
[1:43:29] Hallelujah. Thank you for your patience
[1:43:31] today. Amen. As we look at that, you see
[1:43:34] these mysteries, they're not something
[1:43:36] to be afraid of. Embrace them. This is
[1:43:39] God speaking to you. Amen. If it's a man
[1:43:43] speaking to you, then you'll see a man's
[1:43:45] results. But when it's God speaking to
[1:43:47] you, you will see the word bringing in
[1:43:49] you something like you never thought you
[1:43:52] could ever be. The person that deep
[1:43:55] inside you always longed to be but never
[1:43:58] thought you could be. And God says
[1:44:02] just follow me. I'll take you to that
[1:44:06] higher calling.
[1:44:09] Amen.
[1:44:10] Hallelujah. Saints, I just felt very
[1:44:14] strongly about this.
[1:44:18] Lord, don't let this word be, this word
[1:44:20] that's been opened, been brought in our
[1:44:22] day. Let's don't become tradition. Don't
[1:44:25] let it become head knowledge. Let it
[1:44:27] become life.
[1:44:29] &gt;&gt; Let it become what you know is true. I
[1:44:32] know my crazy analogy of the man laying
[1:44:34] on the highway, the person laying on the
[1:44:36] highway.
[1:44:37] But how thankful they are when the
[1:44:40] ambulance drives up and they say, "Hey,
[1:44:44] we've got blood expander. We can plug
[1:44:47] this hole in his body." Amen. Sister
[1:44:49] April shared with me one time a little
[1:44:51] situation. We won't go into it, but
[1:44:53] she's there doing her part, what she's
[1:44:55] called to do while those around him are
[1:44:57] are are are stopping this damage to this
[1:45:01] young man's body and the blood just
[1:45:02] running out. I forget how much it was
[1:45:04] just this incredible amount of blood
[1:45:06] they put in him, but they saved his life
[1:45:10] and the blood of Jesus Christ.
[1:45:15] Is it a one-time event?
[1:45:18] Is the anointing of the Holy Ghost just
[1:45:19] a one-time thing in our life? Not
[1:45:22] according to the word?
[1:45:24] Why don't we just come and jump into the
[1:45:26] pool this morning? You say, "But brother
[1:45:29] Paul, I haven't been sinning." It
[1:45:31] doesn't matter. A good washing. Amen. A
[1:45:35] good washing
[1:45:37] feels good.
[1:45:39] &gt;&gt; A hot shower, you might say, feels good.
[1:45:43] A washing by the water of the word.
[1:45:46] A coming back to the altar and saying,
[1:45:49] "Lord, I just like my life to step up a
[1:45:54] little bit higher. I want to I want to
[1:45:57] step up a little more consecrated life.
[1:46:00] I want you to reveal to me. I'm telling
[1:46:02] you, I was there privileged. They I
[1:46:05] wasn't part of their program, but they
[1:46:06] just pulled me in and we were there in
[1:46:08] the services with the young people.
[1:46:11] And afterwards to hear what the young
[1:46:12] people were saying, my brothers and
[1:46:14] sisters, I was also privileged and asked
[1:46:17] to be praying for those, not a big huge
[1:46:20] prayer line, but just just Brother
[1:46:21] Barry, Brother Eric, and then they
[1:46:23] invited me, I don't know why, to come
[1:46:25] and to pray for these young people. And
[1:46:27] I'll just be blunt with you. There were
[1:46:29] kids there, teenagers, early 20s, born
[1:46:33] and raised in the message of the hour,
[1:46:36] standing there saying, "I need
[1:46:38] deliverance."
[1:46:40] Pornography, cigarettes, alcohol, and
[1:46:43] drugs. I need deliverance.
[1:46:47] &gt;&gt; Whoa, whoa, whoa. You can't say that you
[1:46:48] were born in the message. No, no. He was
[1:46:52] desiring to be born in Jesus Christ.
[1:46:55] &gt;&gt; Amen. not say he was born in some kind
[1:46:58] of a movement, some kind of a group, but
[1:47:01] he wanted to be born in Jesus Christ.
[1:47:04] Hallelujah. My brother and sister, I
[1:47:06] could go on several examples there that
[1:47:08] are that are there. Kids raised in
[1:47:11] church
[1:47:12] and it didn't save them.
[1:47:16] &gt;&gt; Help us, Lord.
[1:47:24] &gt;&gt; Help us, Lord.
[1:47:26] Lord, I lift my hand this morning
[1:47:29] and I say, Lord,
[1:47:32] I want you to cleanse me again, Lord.
[1:47:37] &gt;&gt; Lord, you've washed me. You've spoke to
[1:47:39] me. Lord, you've come so many times and
[1:47:42] anointed me.
[1:47:45] &gt;&gt; But Lord, one more time, I stand here
[1:47:47] and say, Lord, would you just please
[1:47:49] come by and speak to my heart?
[1:47:54] Just wash me,
[1:47:56] Lord, cuz I want to be wider than snow.
[1:47:59] I don't want to be just a good church
[1:48:01] person.
[1:48:03] I don't want to be able to explain
[1:48:06] your Bible or the message, Lord. I want
[1:48:09] to be able to live it.
[1:48:12] &gt;&gt; I want it to be real to me.
[1:48:15] &gt;&gt; Lord, take away my bitterness, my
[1:48:17] anxieties, my fears, my depressions.
[1:48:21] Lord, take away everything that's not
[1:48:23] you, Lord.
[1:48:24] &gt;&gt; Because Lord, I I'm longing in my heart
[1:48:27] to just step up a little higher.
[1:48:30] And Lord, when I take that final step, I
[1:48:35] just want to hear those words, "Well
[1:48:37] done.
[1:48:39] Well done, my good and faithful
[1:48:41] servant."
[1:48:45] If you feel this in your heart today,
[1:48:47] just
[1:48:49] lift your heart, lift a hand if you
[1:48:51] desire
[1:48:52] &gt;&gt; and say, "Lord, just come down. You
[1:48:55] promised to lead me to all truth,
[1:48:58] &gt;&gt; and I'm here today, Lord, to act upon
[1:49:00] that promise.
[1:49:12] Cleanse my heart, oh God.
[1:49:19] Make it ever
[1:49:22] true.
[1:49:26] Cleanse my heart, oh God.
[1:49:33] May I be like you.
[1:49:40] &gt;&gt; You are my potter.
[1:49:46] I am the clay.
[1:49:54] Mold me and make
[1:49:57] me.
[1:50:00] This is why I pray.
[1:50:06] Change my heart, oh God.
[1:50:13] Make it ever
[1:50:16] true.
[1:50:20] Change my heart, oh God.
[1:50:26] May I be like you.
[1:50:32] Hallelujah.
[1:50:36] You see this word was not given to us
[1:50:41] for knowledge.
[1:50:44] Was not given to be a doctrine.
[1:50:47] It
[1:50:47] &gt;&gt; was given to be life.
[1:50:51] And we know that there's no growth
[1:50:56] unless there's something there to feed
[1:50:58] that growth.
[1:51:02] &gt;&gt; And for a Christian, the only thing that
[1:51:04] will make us grow spiritually is the
[1:51:07] word of God.
[1:51:09] &gt;&gt; Saints, pardon me. I just feel to say
[1:51:12] these things.
[1:51:14] If you haven't been in the word like you
[1:51:15] should,
[1:51:16] &gt;&gt; that's right. been too busy, too much
[1:51:18] trouble. Trouble in the family, trouble
[1:51:20] in your finances, trouble at work. I
[1:51:22] don't care what trouble it is. God don't
[1:51:23] care what trouble it is. We're the ones
[1:51:25] that carry what we we're the ones that
[1:51:27] say, "Well, because of this and this."
[1:51:29] God doesn't care.
[1:51:30] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:51:32] &gt;&gt; Just put that to the side.
[1:51:33] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:51:34] &gt;&gt; And say, "Lord, I just want to be closer
[1:51:37] to you.
[1:51:38] &gt;&gt; I want you to just help me to set
[1:51:40] everything to the side that's a
[1:51:42] hindrance in my life."
[1:51:46] Amen. Hallelujah. I got more here and
[1:51:48] I'm trying to resist uh reading this.
[1:51:51] Amen. But look at this, my brother and
[1:51:53] sister. When the Apostle Paul, once
[1:51:56] again, I want to just bring this.
[1:52:01] He says in Galatians 1:12,
[1:52:04] "For neither received it of man, neither
[1:52:08] was I taught it, but by the revelation
[1:52:11] of Jesus Christ." Amen. Let that be.
[1:52:15] what opens the word to you a revelation
[1:52:18] that come
[1:52:19] &gt;&gt; Amen
[1:52:19] &gt;&gt; from Jesus Christ. God bless you today
[1:52:22] saints. I trust amen that that it'll be
[1:52:26] something that would just bless your
[1:52:27] life. Amen.
[1:52:32] My I just
[1:52:34] that overpowering urge to just finish
[1:52:36] what you have for notes.
[1:52:38] Amen.
[1:52:40] Oh, Holy Spirit,
[1:52:43] thou art welcoming
[1:52:49] this place.
[1:52:52] Holy Spirit,
[1:52:55] thou art welcome
[1:52:59] in
[1:53:01] this place.
[1:53:04] Omnipotent
[1:53:08] Father
[1:53:10] of mercy
[1:53:13] and grace.
[1:53:15] Thou art welcome
[1:53:19] in
[1:53:21] this place.
[1:53:26] Lord in thy presence
[1:53:32] there's healing
[1:53:34] divine
[1:53:37] and no other
[1:53:40] power
[1:53:43] can save Lord but thine.
[1:53:50] Oh, Holy Spirit,
[1:53:53] thou art well.
[1:53:56] Come in
[1:53:59] this place.
[1:54:02] Thou art well.
[1:54:05] Come in
[1:54:08] this place.
[1:54:12] Amen.
[1:54:16] If one would feel like I maybe spoke a
[1:54:19] little too strong or something, I just
[1:54:21] want to tell you that when I was
[1:54:23] studying this thought,
[1:54:25] it actually was the Lord speaking to my
[1:54:28] heart.
[1:54:30] &gt;&gt; And was telling me, Paul, come up a
[1:54:33] little higher.
[1:54:35] &gt;&gt; You can do it, Paul.
[1:54:37] &gt;&gt; You can come up higher.
[1:54:40] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:54:41] &gt;&gt; That's the desire of my heart. I don't
[1:54:44] want to be a studio Christian.
[1:54:47] I don't want to be a Christian in name
[1:54:50] only.
[1:54:52] &gt;&gt; I want to be a real Christian.
[1:54:54] &gt;&gt; God bless you, saints. Amen. Pray you
[1:54:57] have a lovely day.
[1:55:05] Thank you.
[1:55:07] God bless you. Amen. As I was looking
[1:55:10] this morning,
[1:55:13] after the sermon just song pass me not
[1:55:17] oh gentle savior you know been reading
[1:55:19] in chronicles and I don't even remember
[1:55:22] the exact situation but whatever it was
[1:55:24] they humbled themselves before God
[1:55:28] and they they fell before him and you
[1:55:30] know
[1:55:32] and he came and he forgave them he's
[1:55:37] his mercy and his grace
[1:55:42] But then the last verse of the song,
[1:55:43] I've always loved it. Thou the spring of
[1:55:45] all my comfort more than life to me. Is
[1:55:48] that not the feeling of your heart this
[1:55:50] morning? Amen. Let's just sing this
[1:55:53] together.
[1:55:57] Pass
[1:55:59] me not, oh gentle
[1:56:04] Savior.

[1:56:11] my humble
[1:56:15] cry.

[1:57:30] me
[1:57:32] by.
[1:57:38] Let
[1:57:40] me at thy throne of mercy.
[1:57:50] Find
[1:57:53] a sweet
[1:57:55] relief.

[1:58:55] I would call
[1:58:59] holy.
[1:59:02] Do
[1:59:04] not pass me
[1:59:08] by.
[1:59:13] Turn trusting
[1:59:17] only in thy merit.
[1:59:26] Would
[1:59:28] I seek
[1:59:30] thy face?
[1:59:38] Heal
[1:59:40] my woundedly
[1:59:42] broken spirit.

[2:01:01] than life
[2:01:03] to me.

[2:01:12] have I on earth beside
[2:01:18] I thee?
[2:01:21] Whom
[2:01:24] in heaven
[2:01:26] but thee.

[2:02:17] Amen.
[2:02:19] Hallelujah.
[2:02:21] Amen. I just feel like worshiping him
[2:02:23] this evening or this morning. I don't
[2:02:26] sorry
[2:02:29] nothing without you.
[2:02:37] Take these hands
[2:02:42] and lift them up.
[2:02:48] For I have not the strength to praise
[2:02:53] you near enough.
[2:02:58] I am nothing.
[2:03:03] I have nothing
[2:03:08] without
[2:03:10] you.
[2:03:14] Take my voice
[2:03:19] and pour it out.
[2:03:24] Let it sing the songs of mercy I have
[2:03:30] found.
[2:03:33] I am nothing,
[2:03:37] Lord. I am nothing
[2:03:43] without you.
[2:03:48] And all my soul
[2:03:52] needs
[2:03:55] is all your love
[2:03:59] to sw me
[2:04:03] so all the world
[2:04:07] will see.
[2:04:10] I have nothing
[2:04:15] without you.
[2:04:20] Take my body
[2:04:24] and build it up.
[2:04:29] May it be broken as an offering
[2:04:34] of love.
[2:04:38] I am nothing.
[2:04:43] I have nothing.
[2:04:48] without you.
[2:04:53] Take my time
[2:04:57] here on this earth.
[2:05:03] Let it glorify
[2:05:05] you all that you are worth.
[2:05:11] For I am nothing.
[2:05:17] I have nothing
[2:05:22] without you.
[2:05:26] And all my soul
[2:05:31] needs
[2:05:33] is all your love
[2:05:38] to cover me.
[2:05:42] So all the world
[2:05:46] will see
[2:05:49] I am nothing
[2:05:55] without you.
[2:06:00] Hallelujah. Lord Jesus, we love you.
[2:06:04] Truly, we are nothing without you, Lord
[2:06:06] God. Without your Holy Spirit, Lord
[2:06:09] Jesus,
[2:06:11] all that we could ever do or hope to do
[2:06:13] is nothing.
[2:06:18] Oh God,
[2:06:21] Lord, I pray you go with these people
[2:06:23] today in a mighty way, Lord God.
[2:06:27] Lead them, guide them, direct them
[2:06:30] closer to you with each step, with each
[2:06:32] breath. Lord Jesus,
[2:06:35] each one of us, Lord God,
[2:06:40] I can't can't even express the desire in
[2:06:42] my heart sometimes to be closer to you,
[2:06:45] Lord Jesus. My words, they can't do it.
[2:06:54] Lord, bless each one this morning, Lord
[2:06:56] Jesus. Go with them, I pray in Jesus
[2:06:58] name. Amen.
