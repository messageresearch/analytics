[40:46] there although I might not need it cuz
[40:48] you're going to put a words here on the
[40:50] screen so but uh I still kind of feel
[40:53] complete
[40:54] by having it here here with
[40:57] me go to Jeremiah
[41:07] 21 and it reads like this unto these
[41:11] people thus shalt say thus said the Lord
[41:15] behold I said before you the way of life
[41:17] and the way of death he that abided in
[41:21] the city shall die by The Sword and by
[41:23] the famine and by the pestilence
[41:27] but he that goeth
[41:29] out and and followed unto the calans
[41:33] that besch you he shall live and his
[41:36] life shall be unto him for
[41:38] pray for I have set my face against this
[41:42] city for evil and not for good said the
[41:45] Lord it shall be given into the hand of
[41:48] the king of
[41:50] Babylon and he shall burn it with
[41:54] fire now if you go go to book of
[41:58] Deuteronomy
[42:11] 8 and the lord gave me this scripture
[42:15] this morning the Deuteronomy
[42:21] 8th
[42:25] 88th
[42:30] amen but Thou shalt remember the Lord
[42:33] thy God for it is he that giveth the
[42:35] power to get wealth and he may establish
[42:38] his Covenant which he swore unto thy
[42:41] Fathers as it is this day and it shall
[42:44] be if thou add if do if thou do add all
[42:50] forget the Lord thy God and walk after
[42:53] other gods and serve them and worship
[42:56] them them I testify against you against
[42:59] you this day that you shall surely
[43:03] perish let's bow our heads Heavenly
[43:06] Father we thank you this morning Lord we
[43:08] we can
[43:09] just read these lines father
[43:13] but you're the one who can give us the
[43:15] Revelation father so I ask you this
[43:18] morning with my humble heart father we
[43:21] ask you to come and speak to these
[43:23] people this morning in the name of the
[43:25] Lord Jesus Christ
[43:27] amen amen
[43:31] um
[43:33] I I have uh this this thought for a
[43:37] little while
[43:39] that the Bible says the Lord presented
[43:41] to before us two paths or two
[43:44] ways and he did it to the children of
[43:48] Israel and and and he's doing it for us
[43:50] this this day so um here in this book of
[43:55] uh
[43:56] the Jeremiah it says I I I said before
[43:59] you the way of life and the way of death
[44:03] and you go to the to to the New
[44:05] Testament and and and the Lord Jesus
[44:07] says I am the truth the way and the life
[44:10] so here in in in in Deuteronomy it says
[44:14] remember the Lord your God he is the one
[44:16] who gives you power to be
[44:19] successful so uh it's
[44:23] plain that if you go against God you're
[44:27] going to find Death so but if you walk
[44:31] along the the will of God you're going
[44:33] to find life he's he's going to give you
[44:36] success in life and and and and I'm not
[44:39] talking about uh MoneyWise successful
[44:43] MoneyWise or or possessions here in this
[44:46] Earth because at the end remember we're
[44:48] just pilgrims here we we're we're not
[44:51] setting places here or palaces or
[44:55] Mansions nothing nothing like that we're
[44:56] just here because this is our time to go
[44:59] through this journey and we're here just
[45:02] to
[45:04] show what is inside of you which is the
[45:08] Lord Jesus Christ that's that's the
[45:10] purpose of life and and uh just looking
[45:14] into the into the scriptures and and in
[45:17] Samuel also um he if you if you don't
[45:21] mind let's just let's just go to Samuel
[45:24] a little bit there
[45:27] 8 1 Samuel
[45:34] 8 we just because for the sake of time
[45:37] I'm I'm I'm going to just skip some
[45:39] scriptures but um you can read the from
[45:44] chap uh chapter 8 verse
[45:46] first um at home but uh I'm going to
[45:50] focus on
[45:52] on on this
[45:54] um
[45:57] verse
[45:58] five and and said unto him behold Thou
[46:02] Art are old and thy Sons walk not in the
[46:06] ways now make us a king to judge to
[46:10] judge us like all the nations and you
[46:13] can write down this scriptures
[46:14] Deuteronomy 17:14 you can write it down
[46:17] for so you can read it at home but uh
[46:21] before
[46:23] God having these people out of Egypt
[46:26] eypt and and he talked to Moses and uh
[46:29] actually my wife showed me this
[46:31] scripture not long ago uh God told Moses
[46:35] and that's talking in Deuteronomy 17:14
[46:38] that at some point ahead of time when I
[46:40] settled my people and the land that I
[46:42] promised to to give it to them they were
[46:45] they was going to require for a
[46:48] king what an awesome God we serve he
[46:51] knows what the people are going to ask
[46:53] him in the future so every time that I I
[46:57] I have a need every time I have a I'm
[46:59] going through some trial or something I
[47:02] know that God already has the answer for
[47:04] it what what what do we need to do is
[47:07] just drop it on his
[47:09] lab and leave it alone amen we we we we
[47:14] we we're not here to to help God to
[47:17] resolve your own problem because if
[47:19] you're going to God for help is because
[47:21] you can do nothing about it amen because
[47:24] we're not
[47:26] helping
[47:28] him in helping
[47:32] you but he knows what we need amen and
[47:35] he knows when we need it answer we've
[47:39] been we've been we've been praying for a
[47:41] for a brother in in North Carolina as
[47:44] one of the sisters son-in-law TR cities
[47:47] sister Connie for those who know
[47:50] her
[47:54] he it's been battling cancer for a
[47:58] little
[48:00] while we've been praying for
[48:03] him at least for two years
[48:08] now and last week we got a
[48:12] text he's cancer free amen praise the
[48:15] Lord praise the Lord prise the
[48:19] Lord see that's that's the kind of God
[48:22] we serve amen I mean we've been praying
[48:25] all this years
[48:27] years and now he's cancer free lordu I
[48:32] mean if if you don't if you don't have
[48:35] the answer right now that doesn't mean
[48:38] God is not listening to
[48:39] you that's
[48:41] right that means he's working on
[48:45] it you just have to let it go and and
[48:49] and when you if you if you have a pro a
[48:52] legal
[48:53] problem you you go hire an attorney
[48:56] right yeah and and and when you hire the
[49:00] attorney you drop your problem in that
[49:02] attorney's office and you walk away
[49:05] that's right trth you you're not next
[49:08] you're not there next day try hey what
[49:10] can do I do for
[49:11] you no because he's taking care of your
[49:14] amen
[49:16] problem it's the same thing with God
[49:18] Amen God is taking care of our problems
[49:22] he's taking care of our needs we just
[49:25] have to let go Amen Let God deal the way
[49:29] he does because the way he does when and
[49:31] his time is the best time always always
[49:35] work that way
[49:37] amen uh so the the
[49:41] sons of Samuel did not walk in the ways
[49:46] of
[49:48] God I mean you go back to the
[49:51] scripture and how many times you see the
[49:54] same pattern
[49:57] yeah what was the reason Samuel came to
[50:00] the
[50:03] scene because Eli's
[50:06] Sons wasn't doing wasn't they were not
[50:10] walking the ways of God Eli was the
[50:14] priest the lineage of Aaron the
[50:17] Levites but here the two these two
[50:22] Rascals these two sons that don't have
[50:26] no fear for God they were just eating
[50:29] getting fed because of the offerings
[50:31] people bringing the the Lambs and and
[50:34] all the the the sacrifices and and and
[50:38] you can go back and read the whole story
[50:40] but I'm just paraphrasing here that he
[50:42] he you know they have to bring the best
[50:44] of the best to sacrifice but what they
[50:47] did is taking even sometimes they take
[50:50] him before to go to the to the to to the
[50:52] sacrifice and take him outside to go to
[50:55] different place kill him and eat
[50:57] him so the people got really really
[51:01] frustrated because they were bringing
[51:03] things to the Lord but but the the
[51:05] Servants of God yeah
[51:08] right there was careless people didn't
[51:12] fear
[51:13] God you know that's that's the beauty
[51:15] here when you build a relationship with
[51:17] your God not with the pastor because
[51:21] every every every single one of men is
[51:23] going to fail you amen but God never
[51:26] fails you
[51:28] amen we are here just to do our part
[51:33] amen and that part is to play a role
[51:36] that share with you the word of God but
[51:40] that doesn't mean you don't have the
[51:41] same access I have to God that's right
[51:45] so the beauty of this is that you have
[51:47] the same access to God and you can come
[51:50] to him and ask and talk to
[51:53] him the same way I have
[51:56] the opportunity amen but here these
[51:58] people are are are bringing obviously
[52:01] this when the law was and and so what
[52:05] caused these people to draw away from
[52:08] God the actions of the priest
[52:12] amen because they say well this if if
[52:15] I'm bringing this with all my heart and
[52:18] I want to share this sacrifice with the
[52:20] Lord and then these people are doing the
[52:23] whatever they want so what is purpose of
[52:25] bringing my My Sacrifice that's it so
[52:30] they start following other gods right
[52:33] and again there is before you there's
[52:35] two ways two paths which one you going
[52:40] to choose this
[52:42] morning and and and there's not there's
[52:44] no difference
[52:46] today we still have the same opportunity
[52:50] we we still have the two pths before us
[52:54] we still have the the the the same the
[52:57] same God that uh told the children of
[53:00] Israel that that they need to follow
[53:05] close the Commandments of the
[53:09] Lord
[53:13] and I remember every time that I I I
[53:18] look at this
[53:21] history and then I bring it up to the
[53:23] this day
[53:26] and I remember brother says the spirits
[53:28] won't die they just jump from place to
[53:33] place
[53:35] so the
[53:37] enemy is upgrading his
[53:39] Arsenal to attack the children of
[53:43] God so he takes advantage of every
[53:46] single Gadget is possible for him to
[53:51] use to drive us away from the from God
[53:55] you know I had the I had the
[53:58] opportunity uh on on December
[54:01] 31st uh family member she's a um a
[54:08] niece and she say why you don't come
[54:11] with us to to to celebrate the the end
[54:15] of the year we have some you know every
[54:18] time you gather together got to be food
[54:20] right so she had some she did some
[54:23] cooking and we we spent some time there
[54:26] and they she's Catholic the the husband
[54:29] is not really into it it's just kind of
[54:33] I don't know it's you know because you
[54:38] see wrong things here you see wrong
[54:40] things
[54:42] there
[54:43] so the husband asked me say
[54:47] why why your brother is Catholic
[54:50] Catholic and you're
[54:52] not so what's the difference between you
[54:54] two
[54:56] I
[54:57] say well number
[55:00] one nothing against the Catholic people
[55:04] but the Catholic
[55:07] religion they tried to push their agenda
[55:10] more about the books that the pope
[55:13] write and and the teachings of the
[55:17] Pope than the
[55:19] Bible so that's number one he said but
[55:22] but your brother reads the Bible right I
[55:24] said yes he reads the
[55:26] Bible but and not only him is many even
[55:29] the priests read the Bible but they they
[55:32] more focus on the teachings from
[55:37] Rome
[55:38] so they have the Bible here and they
[55:41] have this other book from the the from
[55:44] Rome and they get they more focused and
[55:46] and they obey more what the book book
[55:48] from Rome says than the
[55:50] Bible so we start talking and I ended up
[55:55] speaking probably close to three hours
[55:57] there
[55:58] so she he was asking questions then she
[56:01] jumped in trying to make a PO her point
[56:05] and
[56:06] say I say the only reason I am a
[56:10] Christian is because I see the hand of
[56:13] God
[56:15] manifest what the Bible says that's
[56:18] right and he's bringing it to
[56:20] pass and is the same God in the people
[56:24] of Israel and he's the same God today so
[56:27] I saw the hand of God in my my son's
[56:29] life he healed him from from leukemia uh
[56:33] uh he healed me he he's been through all
[56:36] the way I mean the the things that I'm
[56:38] able to do now is because God's grace I
[56:41] trust in God I didn't trust in a
[56:44] minister a pastor or nothing I said
[56:46] because the first Pastor that I have in
[56:49] Mexico he was a mess he got kicked out
[56:53] and then we move on to another
[56:56] pastor and he was a
[57:01] thief so I didn't build my relationship
[57:04] based on what the
[57:07] pastors my relationship my my my
[57:10] commitment is with
[57:12] God I mean and then then the the the
[57:15] last Pastor that I had it
[57:17] was I mean it's another
[57:20] mess I don't
[57:23] trust the pastor are just
[57:26] because he's speaking really nice I have
[57:30] to go back I say I say Jesus Christ says
[57:33] you have to read the
[57:35] scriptures study the scriptures because
[57:38] in that's where you're going to find
[57:39] eternal life
[57:42] amen and when he says I'm I am the truth
[57:46] life and the
[57:47] way what is he telling you so everything
[57:51] else besides the word of
[57:53] God it's
[57:55] garbage so I don't get where he comes
[57:58] from even Paul said if even if an angel
[58:01] comes from Heaven speaking another
[58:05] message let it be
[58:08] cursed so the main thing here for us is
[58:11] is that your Rel relationship is built
[58:14] upon the word of God Amen and your
[58:16] commitment is with God Amen that's right
[58:19] because the word of God will never fail
[58:21] even though sometimes we feel like oh
[58:24] God is how forgot about me
[58:27] no he never amen he never will forget
[58:31] about his children amen that's right
[58:36] imagine and this was against his will
[58:39] but he was
[58:40] prepared when he told Moses they're
[58:43] going to ask for a king down the road
[58:48] why because we as people as human beings
[58:53] we want to look like the other
[58:56] ones that's the human part of us but
[59:00] when when when when when you born
[59:02] again you don't want to look like rock
[59:06] stars you don't want to look like the
[59:09] movie
[59:12] stars you want to look like
[59:16] Christ because that's the seed is
[59:18] planted in you and the the fruits is
[59:21] going to show it's going to prove the
[59:24] res the people what kind of person you
[59:27] are what kind of spirit is living inside
[59:30] of
[59:31] you I think it's in Ezekiel says I'm
[59:34] going to give you a new
[59:38] spirit brother BR says many people
[59:40] mistaken that that with that new spirit
[59:43] is the Holy Ghost but it's not that's
[59:44] right amen that's
[59:46] right the Holy Ghost comes to meet the
[59:50] new
[59:51] spirit and I told I told that man my my
[59:54] my family member man and and New Year's
[59:58] Eve I say Lord Jesus says You must be
[1:00:01] born again that's right amen if you're
[1:00:04] not born again you can even see the
[1:00:06] kingdom of God that's right amen that's
[1:00:08] right so I hope I can answer your
[1:00:11] question I
[1:00:12] say but the only way to make it to
[1:00:19] Heaven Is by being born again that's
[1:00:22] correct give your heart to the Lord
[1:00:24] that's right and let it be your lord and
[1:00:29] savior and then she says oh we we we
[1:00:32] brought up the subject of
[1:00:35] purgatory and and she said so you don't
[1:00:38] believe in patory I said no said why I
[1:00:41] said what in the Bible says about
[1:00:44] purgatory well what about the people
[1:00:46] that that that died and and and and and
[1:00:50] they're committed crimes like like my
[1:00:53] brother got killed this guy who kill the
[1:00:54] brother my brother he needs to
[1:00:58] pay I say yes but what is worse killing
[1:01:02] someone or stealing candy from a kid
[1:01:06] yeah she said well killing I said
[1:01:10] according to the Ten Commandments
[1:01:12] robbing and killing is the same sin
[1:01:14] before God that's right so you're
[1:01:17] responsible for
[1:01:19] now and I say but when you repent for
[1:01:22] all your sins
[1:01:26] everything is blotted
[1:01:28] out and that's because the sacrifice
[1:01:30] that Jesus did on the
[1:01:32] cross said no but you I said look at
[1:01:35] this the thief on the
[1:01:38] cross it was on the cross not because he
[1:01:40] was a Mr Nice
[1:01:42] Guy he did a terrible crimes the Bible
[1:01:45] doesn't specify what kind of crimes but
[1:01:47] even him
[1:01:49] said to the other guy said don't you
[1:01:55] have a little bit of
[1:01:56] respect we deserve to be here but this
[1:02:00] man is innocent so he knew that he was a
[1:02:06] sinner that's the first thing we have to
[1:02:08] do we have to
[1:02:10] recognize we need God in our
[1:02:15] hearts because as long as you don't
[1:02:17] recognize you're a sinner you always
[1:02:18] feel feel like you're a holy man a holy
[1:02:22] woman you don't need God because you're
[1:02:23] holy what where where the Holiness is
[1:02:25] coming from is not from God Amen that's
[1:02:28] right so he did the right thing he
[1:02:31] repented that's right he said Lord
[1:02:33] remember
[1:02:36] me and what did he say
[1:02:41] today so I told her I told her I say he
[1:02:44] never say you no you need to go to the
[1:02:46] Purgatory and then we talk about it then
[1:02:49] then then after that we going to have
[1:02:50] this discussion no there's not such a
[1:02:54] thing thing you reject the Lord Jesus
[1:02:56] today yeah you don't have a chance
[1:03:00] right but that's why God is telling you
[1:03:03] today that you have two ways before you
[1:03:06] amen you choose the life or you choose
[1:03:08] the death that's right amen there there
[1:03:11] is there is no in between amen amen
[1:03:15] that's God's word is not mine amen amen
[1:03:18] so you you have to understand that God
[1:03:21] is talking to you that that we have to
[1:03:24] give everything that
[1:03:25] we is impeding to have that great
[1:03:29] relationship between you and
[1:03:31] God because every anything that is
[1:03:34] between you and God is your idol it's
[1:03:36] your God that's right amen amen simple
[1:03:39] as that that's right
[1:03:42] right that's I want to share with you
[1:03:45] some quotes from brother
[1:03:48] brandham I don't know what you guys have
[1:03:50] but always made me
[1:03:53] sentimental
[1:03:55] I'm sorry about that just brother Brown
[1:04:07] says men
[1:04:09] are you can't guide yourself that's
[1:04:12] right there is two ways that's your way
[1:04:16] and God's way and when you're in your
[1:04:19] way you're out of God's
[1:04:22] way and you are forget your own way to
[1:04:25] find God's way a man cannot lead
[1:04:29] himself we always need a guide amen amen
[1:04:35] amen in Matthew
[1:04:40] 713 enter ye into the Straight Gate for
[1:04:44] white is the gate and abroad is the way
[1:04:48] that leadth to D to destruction and many
[1:04:51] there be which g go in in their at
[1:04:54] because straight is the gate and narrow
[1:04:57] is the way which lead into life and
[1:05:01] few there be that find it another
[1:05:05] version says there are two paths before
[1:05:08] you you may take only one path one
[1:05:12] doorway is narrow and one door is wide
[1:05:16] go through the narrow door for the wide
[1:05:18] door leads to the Wi path and wide path
[1:05:22] is Broad the wide
[1:05:24] Brad pad is easy and the why BR easy pad
[1:05:28] has many many people on it but the white
[1:05:32] BR easy crowded PS led to death now then
[1:05:39] that narrow door leads to a narrow road
[1:05:42] that it
[1:05:43] turn that in turn leads to a
[1:05:47] life it is hard to find a road not many
[1:05:50] people can manage
[1:05:53] find
[1:05:57] I have
[1:06:02] this I have a problem brother BR
[1:06:05] say that
[1:06:08] uh the
[1:06:10] problem is
[1:06:15] that biggest
[1:06:17] enemy you can put your name on it that's
[1:06:20] it that's the truth is Jose Hernandez
[1:06:24] he's the one who gets in God's way
[1:06:27] that's right right he's the one that
[1:06:29] gets lazy he's the one that gets to a
[1:06:32] place sometimes where he thinks he can
[1:06:34] do something about it and when he does
[1:06:37] that shows God a way out of the picture
[1:06:41] but when I can get rid of that guy
[1:06:43] that's it that guy that's it when I can
[1:06:46] get the place that he's out of the way
[1:06:50] amen then God can come over
[1:06:54] and do things that Jose Hernandez can do
[1:06:57] that's
[1:06:59] right that's when God can use
[1:07:02] you that's when he can use any of you he
[1:07:06] can use anybody when we get out
[1:07:10] of God's way but as long as we go
[1:07:14] ourselves in the way that's it
[1:07:18] amen God can do anything that's
[1:07:21] right that's right EXA
[1:07:26] imagine the children of
[1:07:31] Israel all excited because they
[1:07:35] living
[1:07:37] bondage from
[1:07:39] Egypt oh well we could imagine that all
[1:07:43] of them were excited but let me let me
[1:07:46] give you some news that all not all of
[1:07:48] them were excited about
[1:07:50] it because they were happy
[1:07:54] where they had over
[1:07:56] there but only a few people they
[1:07:59] were consecrated to God only a few
[1:08:03] people were the ones never forget the
[1:08:06] promise God told Abraham right so these
[1:08:09] people start crying out for
[1:08:11] a
[1:08:14] savior and then and and all these people
[1:08:18] become to reduce into one
[1:08:22] family and you go back and read the
[1:08:25] Bible says they were crying out for a
[1:08:27] liberator or a
[1:08:30] savior and God
[1:08:32] came on the
[1:08:36] time not at the time that people were
[1:08:38] expecting God but they were just praying
[1:08:41] about savior
[1:08:44] when they didn't know but some of them
[1:08:48] because God didn't answer the prayer at
[1:08:50] the time they were thinking they just
[1:08:54] forgot about it well maybe God forgot
[1:08:56] about
[1:08:57] us if he did he if he gave you a promise
[1:09:00] make sure that God is going to make it
[1:09:04] happen amen not on your time but it's in
[1:09:07] his time always amen that's right always
[1:09:11] that's right so here we have
[1:09:17] Hannah
[1:09:19] having
[1:09:21] problems that she couldn't
[1:09:24] have
[1:09:27] kids
[1:09:30] and she
[1:09:32] was so concerned about
[1:09:36] it but for for some other people I I I I
[1:09:40] don't believe that she was the only
[1:09:41] baren woman at that
[1:09:46] time we we see
[1:09:48] in cases nowadays a lot of women can't
[1:09:52] have babies
[1:09:54] so at that time to me is not there's no
[1:09:58] difference I can assure you that there
[1:10:00] were more than one Hannah with that
[1:10:03] problem but only one was surrendered to
[1:10:06] God that's it right see because she had
[1:10:09] a choice amen okay I can't have babies
[1:10:13] that's okay I have a loving
[1:10:16] husband I'll be happy I'm okay with it
[1:10:19] but she was
[1:10:21] not so my question is what moves
[1:10:27] Hannah to go into the broken
[1:10:31] Spirit to pour out his soul her soul out
[1:10:35] of and and give everything to
[1:10:39] God to the point where the
[1:10:42] priest the holy
[1:10:44] man supposed to know the his
[1:10:49] people he thought was she that she was
[1:10:52] drunk
[1:10:54] you know
[1:10:56] what the actions of this man
[1:10:59] caused death to many
[1:11:02] people because they
[1:11:04] were following other God
[1:11:07] gods and the
[1:11:11] father it was easier for him just
[1:11:16] to oh I don't see oh I have a perfect
[1:11:20] voice I can see I can say the same thing
[1:11:22] about my boys even though they're not
[1:11:24] perfect but we have to understand that
[1:11:27] what before
[1:11:28] God my perfection is
[1:11:32] nothing we got to meet God's standards
[1:11:35] that's it that's right and that's that's
[1:11:37] what those people should done it they
[1:11:41] had to meet God's standards to be what
[1:11:43] they to be doing the the job they were
[1:11:46] called to
[1:11:47] do so there is
[1:11:50] Hannah
[1:11:52] praying and she she she she
[1:11:55] broke her heart her soul her soul came
[1:11:59] out and in a prayer when you do that
[1:12:02] before
[1:12:03] God I challenge you if you do that to
[1:12:08] God he's going to come to
[1:12:11] you he's going to come to
[1:12:16] you I I experienced
[1:12:19] that you know I I I I I I um
[1:12:25] I got
[1:12:26] married and I came to Mexico
[1:12:30] to to get
[1:12:32] the to require my wife's visa to come
[1:12:37] into Mexico from
[1:12:40] Peru and it was taking too
[1:12:44] long so one time in a in a church in
[1:12:47] Mexico
[1:12:49] City I just pour out my spirit to God
[1:12:52] and say Lord please
[1:12:54] speed up this
[1:12:57] process it wasn't a Sunday and in a
[1:13:01] Monday she called me and says I got a
[1:13:04] call from the Mexican
[1:13:10] consulate that's God that's
[1:13:14] right so you never forget that you Ser
[1:13:17] serving a living God Amen that's right
[1:13:20] that's right we're
[1:13:22] we're
[1:13:24] we don't we don't want to be part of
[1:13:25] this other group of
[1:13:28] people that they they got a chance to
[1:13:30] know God and and and
[1:13:32] because we always living in in a fast
[1:13:37] living everything is just speed speed
[1:13:41] speed but God God is not that way that's
[1:13:45] exactly
[1:13:46] right we have to understand that we have
[1:13:49] to adjust ourselves to God's
[1:13:52] plan
[1:13:53] but we want to make to AA to a
[1:13:57] routine oh I don't have time for you
[1:13:59] today maybe I'll see you
[1:14:03] tomorrow maybe I pray tomorrow because
[1:14:05] I'm too
[1:14:07] busy always is is ourselves who have to
[1:14:11] adjust to God's plan amen
[1:14:22] amen
[1:14:29] brother Brandon
[1:14:33] says God is God has two ways of all
[1:14:37] things that's that's
[1:14:40] right and it has has two ways I'm sorry
[1:14:46] that's a right way and a wrong way and
[1:14:48] your way my way is the wrong
[1:14:50] way God's way is always the right way no
[1:14:54] matter how incorrect it seems to us
[1:14:56] that's it God's way God's ways are truth
[1:15:00] and right amen their past understanding
[1:15:04] but God works in mysterious way his
[1:15:06] wonders
[1:15:09] perform choose God choose Watch God's
[1:15:12] provided way God always makes a provided
[1:15:14] way and his we must follow it now God's
[1:15:18] made a provided way to human race to
[1:15:20] escape the uncoming Judgment in the days
[1:15:23] of Noah he made a provided way but when
[1:15:25] God makes a way man refuses to walk in
[1:15:28] it if there is a
[1:15:31] Miss then if they miss it it's not God's
[1:15:34] fault no more than it is City's fault
[1:15:37] when you run stop the
[1:15:39] light he has made a way amen has made a
[1:15:44] way today yes sir that's right some
[1:15:47] people can see it some people don't what
[1:15:50] can you do about it there's nothing we
[1:15:53] we I mean arguing with people that don't
[1:15:55] agree with your beliefs you're not going
[1:15:57] to make any changes that's right you're
[1:15:59] not you're not going to improve
[1:16:02] anything we're doing more
[1:16:05] damage than helping that's right because
[1:16:10] the moment you start arguing
[1:16:13] yeah it's it's like you're building a
[1:16:17] wall that's right between you and that
[1:16:19] person and you when you build a wall you
[1:16:21] won't able to see what's that's behind
[1:16:23] that wall that's right that's right so
[1:16:27] brother Brandon says So you you're
[1:16:30] drawing a circle getting leaving me out
[1:16:32] of the circle I'm going to make a bigger
[1:16:34] Circle cuz I want to be in that circle
[1:16:37] with you even though you don't agree
[1:16:39] with me as long as you love Jesus Christ
[1:16:41] I love Jesus Christ we just be friends
[1:16:43] and
[1:16:44] brothers because I'm not here to judge
[1:16:48] you I mean even the Lord Jesus say here
[1:16:50] say in the scriptures that I didn't come
[1:16:52] to the world to judge that's right I
[1:16:55] came to save the world that's right but
[1:16:57] but the
[1:16:58] word is the one who's going to
[1:17:00] judge we have the word of God Amen uh uh
[1:17:04] Moses had the the the
[1:17:09] law to be to judge the
[1:17:13] people but when Jesus
[1:17:16] came he gave us
[1:17:19] Grace
[1:17:22] so
[1:17:24] to be
[1:17:25] honest that was my my best end of the
[1:17:28] year that I ever had in so many years
[1:17:31] talking with these people yeah because
[1:17:33] when people ask you have to be ready to
[1:17:36] answer that's right and you know what
[1:17:38] sometimes I I I I I've experienced many
[1:17:41] times that I go to the Bible and I feel
[1:17:44] like it's coming to here or here and
[1:17:46] just going out and I don't know how many
[1:17:49] of you have S same experience but but
[1:17:52] but
[1:17:56] sometimes God's ways like we were just
[1:17:59] read God's ways are strange ways but but
[1:18:03] sometimes even though you feel like that
[1:18:06] something is getting stuck in there
[1:18:09] amen and you don't know until you're
[1:18:13] using it that's it and and and and when
[1:18:16] you're when you're in the in the
[1:18:19] spot that people ask you and then
[1:18:21] something comes out and then another
[1:18:23] thing comes out and another scripture
[1:18:25] and another quote and then you realize
[1:18:28] well it's it's not in vain that's it
[1:18:31] amen I mean because the
[1:18:35] fountain the water fountain has to have
[1:18:38] water to push to have this continuation
[1:18:42] right so the the the more you eat the
[1:18:46] word of
[1:18:47] God there is more to come out am and the
[1:18:51] more you eat
[1:18:53] it's more coming
[1:18:55] out and the word of God is endless amen
[1:18:59] so you not be able to run out until you
[1:19:02] stop
[1:19:05] eating you know last last night we had a
[1:19:08] good dinner brother Isaac thank you I uh
[1:19:11] we had a good dinner
[1:19:13] and
[1:19:15] and there
[1:19:18] is there is
[1:19:19] always something that when you're eating
[1:19:23] if it's such a good food and and you
[1:19:25] don't want it to finish because you want
[1:19:27] to enjoy the the more you can but you
[1:19:30] know that's the stomach has limitation
[1:19:33] right it's the point with no more and
[1:19:36] your mouth wants more but the stomach
[1:19:37] says no more please no more but you know
[1:19:41] what that praise God that doesn't happen
[1:19:43] with the word word of God the word of
[1:19:46] God is you can eat eat eat day and night
[1:19:50] day and night and that's Never Gonna
[1:19:54] feel like oh I can't I can't move
[1:19:57] because I got too many words of
[1:19:59] God
[1:20:03] no
[1:20:06] that's Jesus told the Devil the man
[1:20:10] shall not live bread alone amen by the
[1:20:13] word of
[1:20:15] God so even though this this flesh can
[1:20:21] hold more chicken or more
[1:20:24] steak the soul can still eat eat eat eat
[1:20:30] because God doesn't care about your
[1:20:34] flesh he cares about your
[1:20:37] spirit even though the flesh has to show
[1:20:40] what the SP what kind of spirit you
[1:20:44] have because I I heard some people
[1:20:46] saying denomination say oh God doesn't
[1:20:49] care about how you dress because I mean
[1:20:52] he cares
[1:20:53] yes but when you go to buy bananas
[1:20:56] you're not going to buy the ones that
[1:20:57] had the dots black dots on it you want
[1:21:00] the nicer ones right why why do you care
[1:21:04] about this the peel
[1:21:07] banana if what you're going to eat is
[1:21:09] the banana ins you're going to throw
[1:21:11] away the the the
[1:21:14] peeling
[1:21:16] no you have to make sure that the
[1:21:18] exterior is showing that the the the
[1:21:21] whatever is inside of you it's not
[1:21:23] rotten that's
[1:21:27] right simple as that that's right that's
[1:21:30] the we we yes sir we can be so religious
[1:21:34] and say well I don't care I mean yeah
[1:21:36] you can do whatever you want but God's
[1:21:40] ways is only one way that's right and
[1:21:43] you have to go back to God's
[1:21:49] ways let's go to First Peter
[1:22:05] 1 Peter
[1:22:08] 1

[1:22:51] but do you really mean it that's it

[1:22:56] difference a pure heart doesn't say from
[1:23:00] here that's right
[1:23:02] amen a pure heart feel it from here
[1:23:07] that's right 23 being born again not a
[1:23:13] not of corruptible seed but of
[1:23:16] Incorruptible by the word of God Amen
[1:23:19] which liveth and abideth forever amen
[1:23:24] amen St
[1:23:29] John
[1:23:44] 12 and I'm
[1:23:51] closing
[1:23:56] 44 Jesus cried and said he that believe
[1:24:00] on me believe not on me but on him that
[1:24:03] sent me and he that seeth me seeth him
[1:24:09] that sent me I am come a light into the
[1:24:13] world that whosoever believe on me
[1:24:15] should not abide in
[1:24:17] darkness and if any man hear my words
[1:24:20] and believe not I judge judge him not
[1:24:24] for I come not to judge the world but to
[1:24:26] save the world he that rejected me and
[1:24:29] receive not my words had one that that
[1:24:34] judg him the word that I have spoken the
[1:24:38] same shall judge him in the last day for
[1:24:42] I have not to spoken of myself but the
[1:24:46] Father which sent me he gave me
[1:24:50] Commandment that I should say and what I
[1:24:53] should speak and I know that this
[1:24:56] commandment is life
[1:25:00] Everlasting whatsoever I speak before
[1:25:03] even as the father said unto me so I
[1:25:06] speak so we are seeing
[1:25:10] here the end of our
[1:25:15] decisions you choose to believe in
[1:25:18] Christ you have life amen amen but if
[1:25:21] you reject
[1:25:23] Christ and his
[1:25:26] word we're condemned that's
[1:25:30] it plain that's right and simple that's
[1:25:35] right right
[1:25:40] Amen in Psalm 174 says I have kept kept
[1:25:44] me from the paths of the Destroyer hold
[1:25:46] me
[1:25:47] up in thy
[1:25:50] pths so my footsteps sleep
[1:25:54] not David is praying out that he wants
[1:25:59] to stay in God's
[1:26:01] paths you go back to read the scriptures
[1:26:04] and you're going to find in in in the
[1:26:06] Book of Judges many many times in
[1:26:09] chapter four 5 six is and the children
[1:26:13] of
[1:26:15] Israel fall away from
[1:26:18] God and God delivered him into the
[1:26:21] Canaanites into the amorites into the
[1:26:24] this and this and this group of peoples
[1:26:26] that he
[1:26:28] left to bring his children in
[1:26:31] order you don't want to listen my my my
[1:26:35] I mean how many times they they they
[1:26:37] they saw the hand of God fighting the
[1:26:39] wars for
[1:26:42] them but then generation after
[1:26:46] generation because they didn't have
[1:26:48] these
[1:26:50] experiences they start
[1:26:53] getting
[1:26:55] relaxed they they they live in peace for
[1:26:57] a little while and they get get into
[1:27:01] relaxed State uh
[1:27:04] State and they forgot about God's
[1:27:07] Miracles God's wonders and and what they
[1:27:11] did for the for fathers and and and and
[1:27:14] they start forgetting about being
[1:27:16] faithful to
[1:27:18] God they choosing their own path yeah
[1:27:22] and they've been so
[1:27:25] sinful so the then then God raised this
[1:27:30] Philistines or or Babylonian Kingdom and
[1:27:35] oppress the children of
[1:27:38] Israel and then they oh god you forgot
[1:27:41] about
[1:27:42] us no you forgot about God
[1:27:47] first and I and I believe in judges says
[1:27:50] and there was a generation that did not
[1:27:53] know
[1:27:55] God and the question is why that
[1:27:58] generation didn't know
[1:27:59] God because the parents didn't take the
[1:28:02] time to teach
[1:28:04] them remember what the words of God said
[1:28:07] to
[1:28:07] Joshua never depart This Book of Life
[1:28:11] from
[1:28:13] you you have to meditate day and night
[1:28:16] in
[1:28:19] it and what are we doing
[1:28:25] so the spirit is on
[1:28:27] dying what kind of spirit are you
[1:28:29] letting move into you that's exactly
[1:28:34] right before you I present it to you the
[1:28:39] way of life and the way of death
[1:28:46] amen I'm
[1:28:51] closing
[1:28:55] brother R says look even King Hezekiah
[1:28:57] when he he sent a prophet up to him God
[1:29:00] God did and said put your house in order
[1:29:03] you're going to die Hezekiah threw his
[1:29:06] face to the wall and wept barely say
[1:29:09] Lord I ask you to to consider me I walk
[1:29:13] before before you with perfect
[1:29:17] heart I want you to let me live 15 years
[1:29:22] all right God spoke to the prophet said
[1:29:24] go back and tell him I heard him and
[1:29:28] what did he
[1:29:29] do he brought thisg
[1:29:32] grace even he
[1:29:34] son
[1:29:36] mother
[1:29:39] Isaiah according to the storian says
[1:29:41] that his son was the who cut in pieces
[1:29:44] Isaiah the
[1:29:46] prophet If he if God didn't granted him
[1:29:50] 15 years that guy will never were
[1:29:53] born God's ways are strange
[1:29:58] ways if the grain of wheed doesn't die
[1:30:01] and going into
[1:30:02] Earth it doesn't bring
[1:30:06] fruit but has to die amen so we
[1:30:11] are we have to die to ourselves that's
[1:30:14] exactly right to our Free Will Amen to
[1:30:18] our own way that's right that's it and
[1:30:22] let God have his way
[1:30:26] amen
[1:30:33] amen I'm going to close with this
[1:30:35] scripture here Psalms
[1:30:37] 119
[1:30:50] one
[1:30:58] blessed are they on the file in the way
[1:31:01] who walk in the law of the Lord blessed
[1:31:04] are the that keep his testimonies and
[1:31:07] that seeks him with the whole
[1:31:10] heart they also do not inquire iniquity
[1:31:15] do know iniquity they walk in the ways
[1:31:18] in his ways thou H has commanded us to K
[1:31:21] keep thy precepts
[1:31:27] diligently all that my ways were
[1:31:30] directed to keep thy
[1:31:33] statutes then shall I not be ashamed
[1:31:36] when I have respect unto all thy
[1:31:39] Commandments I will praise thee
[1:31:42] with uprightness of heart when I shall
[1:31:46] have learned thy righteous
[1:31:50] judgments can you please please
[1:31:57] stand I trust the Lord that he
[1:32:00] can reveal to you
[1:32:03] the the rest of the
[1:32:07] word we can only do so
[1:32:10] much
[1:32:15] but he's always willing to to hear your
[1:32:20] voice
[1:32:22] when you come come to him and say
[1:32:26] Lord here I am I surrender to
[1:32:30] you I surrender to you and and and be
[1:32:34] done your
[1:32:36] will that
[1:32:38] was the example that Jesus placs before
[1:32:43] us that we must do God's
[1:32:47] will we must walk God's path amen
[1:32:53] because our
[1:32:55] path it doesn't have an happy
[1:33:00] ending God's
[1:33:02] ways even though sometimes looks
[1:33:05] hard sometimes is looks is very
[1:33:10] difficult to
[1:33:12] walk but it's it's part of the the that
[1:33:17] is going to make you
[1:33:19] stronger because hard times
[1:33:23] makes people
[1:33:25] stronger and easy times makes weak
[1:33:32] people yes sir those are not my words I
[1:33:35] heard from somewhere but they sound like
[1:33:38] a have a lot of Truth in
[1:33:41] it and and you can see it I
[1:33:46] mean people like us that comes from
[1:33:49] another countries that come to America
[1:33:50] to have a better life I heard many of
[1:33:54] them saying Oh I don't want my kid
[1:33:56] doesn't lack anything that I la of so
[1:34:00] I'm going to give everything they
[1:34:03] want and what they turn into a useless
[1:34:09] people you you even the parents call
[1:34:12] them and ask them for a favor they don't
[1:34:14] have time for for the
[1:34:16] parents they disrespectful
[1:34:20] children
[1:34:24] so obviously we want to our kids to have
[1:34:28] better life in
[1:34:29] us but the better life you can offer to
[1:34:34] them is to live for Christ
[1:34:38] ex like I tell the people in Tri Cities
[1:34:41] this is not living this is surviving
[1:34:47] here when we get to live is when we
[1:34:50] cross that River
[1:34:52] that's
[1:34:54] leing I remember last time I saw a
[1:34:56] sister Sergeant walking out the
[1:34:59] door brother Nash was there sister God
[1:35:03] bless you see you in two
[1:35:04] weeks and she turned she was 80
[1:35:07] something years old she turns and say
[1:35:10] Yes Lord willing and if not I'm ready to
[1:35:14] go
[1:35:15] home a week later she was going
[1:35:17] [Music]
[1:35:19] home that's leaving amen a night before
[1:35:23] she she
[1:35:25] died she told her daughter
[1:35:29] says I had a dream that I was
[1:35:32] walking with my
[1:35:35] [Music]
[1:35:37] husband praise the
[1:35:40] [Music]
[1:35:43] Lord we're surviving
[1:35:47] here because we have to battle this
[1:35:50] flesh
[1:35:52] and we have to battle against
[1:35:54] politicians bringing up new laws that
[1:35:58] had nothing to do with the law of God
[1:36:01] that's right kicking out Jesus out of
[1:36:04] schools that's
[1:36:05] [Music]
[1:36:08] it and before they did that they kick
[1:36:10] out of their
[1:36:15] homes they kick Jesus out of the homes
[1:36:18] first before they kick him out of the
[1:36:20] school that's exactly
[1:36:24] right you know I was
[1:36:26] just thinking the other day when you
[1:36:29] send your kids to school and you go to
[1:36:33] work it's
[1:36:35] like 6 to 8 hours of
[1:36:40] school and you would work at least 8
[1:36:44] hours plus two driving back home unless
[1:36:47] you're like this guy here that he can
[1:36:50] work from home
[1:36:53] but you don't have much time spending
[1:36:55] with your
[1:36:56] kids so you drop off your kids at school
[1:37:00] they don't belong to you
[1:37:02] anymore they belong to the
[1:37:05] [Music]
[1:37:07] state isn't that
[1:37:13] something so I am
[1:37:17] blessed and I say thank you
[1:37:20] Lord
[1:37:22] that I'm able to have my kids home
[1:37:25] school I had a couple customer that they
[1:37:29] teacher teachers in the public schools
[1:37:33] we talk about it and they say that's the
[1:37:37] best thing you can do for your
[1:37:40] [Music]
[1:37:42] kids you know many of them don't agree
[1:37:46] but
[1:37:47] this that's their their income
[1:37:52] they don't agree with the rules but is
[1:37:54] their income and they're there I'm not
[1:37:55] going to BL I
[1:37:57] mean who I am to judge him
[1:38:01] but but the
[1:38:03] same again Spirits won't die right but
[1:38:07] the same thing when when when this
[1:38:10] Nicodemus came to Jesus says we know
[1:38:13] that you come from God so it wasn't him
[1:38:17] only but it only was him the one who
[1:38:21] stood up and I'm going to go to see this
[1:38:24] man I'm going to talk to
[1:38:27] him I'm sorry I say I was I'm closing
[1:38:30] but I'm I'm still
[1:38:32] closing
[1:38:34] and not long ago there is a preacher
[1:38:37] from Spain that goes to
[1:38:39] Israel
[1:38:41] many times and he said he was he stood
[1:38:45] up on a on the how do you call it the
[1:38:49] cry
[1:38:50] wall
[1:38:53] the whing wall so he was there and
[1:38:56] there's so many rabbis
[1:38:58] there and one of them came to him and
[1:39:03] says can I talk to you he said yes he
[1:39:08] said they didn't know each
[1:39:11] other he
[1:39:14] says do you
[1:39:18] know that Israel is going to fall
[1:39:21] [Music]
[1:39:25] that war nation's going to raise against
[1:39:31] raise up against
[1:39:32] Israel he said
[1:39:35] yes he says oh we
[1:39:39] know what's
[1:39:41] coming he said you're a Christian right
[1:39:44] he said yes I
[1:39:46] am
[1:39:48] well tell your people get ready
[1:39:52] [Music]
[1:40:00] after they're coming for us we're going
[1:40:02] to go after
[1:40:06] you we know he said we
[1:40:10] know that Jesus was the
[1:40:15] Messiah a
[1:40:19] RBI
[1:40:22] so it's later than we
[1:40:29] thinking so a rabbi recognizing that
[1:40:31] Jesus was the Messiah these
[1:40:34] days he
[1:40:37] said many of us believe that
[1:40:41] way but we must keep our mouth shut
[1:40:44] about
[1:40:46] it
[1:40:49] some dear Church build a huge Temple
[1:40:53] over
[1:40:55] there and they're not allowed
[1:40:58] to share their
[1:41:00] [Music]
[1:41:04] gospel brother and
[1:41:06] sisters L with that's
[1:41:11] right
[1:41:13] let's let's get into the word of God
[1:41:17] that's
[1:41:18] it it's more more
[1:41:21] that's
[1:41:22] it so when the
[1:41:25] voice comes and shouts
[1:41:29] out brother bran says when a deep is
[1:41:31] calling there is must be another deep
[1:41:33] answering that's right but if we don't
[1:41:37] have the same
[1:41:40] connection we must have to be in the
[1:41:43] same
[1:41:45] channel that's it like the two-way
[1:41:49] radio if you if you didn't put the same
[1:41:51] channel you won't be able to talk to
[1:41:53] your partner back then that's right so
[1:41:56] we have to be in the same
[1:41:58] [Music]
[1:41:59] channel this is the channel that's right
[1:42:02] amen that's right the more you eat of
[1:42:06] this the more connected you are to
[1:42:10] God so you don't care where you
[1:42:13] are there is not not dead spots like
[1:42:17] T-Mobile or
[1:42:19] Verizon

[1:42:25] dips of the waters how can I find you
[1:42:29] there that's your
[1:42:33] God he's willing to go that
[1:42:38] profound for

[1:42:47] I could be
[1:42:49] better
[1:42:51] but like that sister says I'm happy that
