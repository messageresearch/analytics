[33:08] thank you lord this battle is over
[33:11] hallelujah the devil's trying to tell
[33:13] you that it's just started but the lord

[33:21] today claim it hallelujah
[33:24] hallelujah
[33:26] oh beautiful
[33:27] you know when things good things are
[33:29] going to happen saints you can always be
[33:31] assured
[33:32] that the devil will show up on the scene
[33:35] and do his very best to discourage you
[33:39] and to take away the freedom that god
[33:42] desired for you
[33:44] every day of your life but even this
[33:46] morning amen the devil would come and
[33:49] try to fuss and fight and stress and
[33:52] strain but you see that's already behind
[33:55] us that's already finished because we're
[33:58] believers of the promise
[34:00] amen we're not believers of the
[34:02] circumstance we're believers of the
[34:04] promise
[34:05] hallelujah and look look what satan did
[34:09] at cadiz barnea he got israel to look
[34:13] at the circumstance
[34:16] and they forgot to look at the promise
[34:19] and look what it cost them
[34:21] oh my let's look at the promise today
[34:23] hallelujah you know i want to just start
[34:26] off to say uh i was very thankful sister
[34:29] dorcas shared a little text with me
[34:32] amen we won't go in the details but
[34:34] answered prayer
[34:35] sometimes circumstance would be such
[34:38] that you look and you think okay it
[34:40] wouldn't make sense that that the people
[34:43] would make decisions like this and it's
[34:46] that but you have to just say well okay
[34:47] lord i give it to your hands
[34:50] and then we don't stress and strain over
[34:51] what the result will be because we know
[34:53] according to the word whatever the
[34:55] result is whether we like it or not is
[34:58] for our benefit but we praise the lord
[35:00] today for an answered prayer amen
[35:02] hallelujah thank you lord
[35:05] hallelujah
[35:07] and you say well brother paul these
[35:08] might be just natural things my brother
[35:10] and sister god cares about your natural
[35:13] things amen let's just remember brother
[35:15] trevor and sister kerry as they're down
[35:18] fellowshipping
[35:19] and uh
[35:20] uh with brother prashant sister akoncha
[35:23] you know i know the last time they were
[35:25] down there brother trevor made a comment
[35:26] on the order of might i have this
[35:28] exactly he so we went down there to
[35:30] encourage uh brother pershant and sister
[35:33] akancha and found them encouraging us
[35:36] that's what it's like to come together
[35:38] in the body of believers amen to to each
[35:42] one of us just come together to be
[35:45] encouraged by one another
[35:47] amen it's good to see each and every one
[35:50] of you every brother every sister amen
[35:53] this morning
[35:54] i want to just
[35:56] speak to you today on today is our
[35:58] judgment day
[36:00] and uh you know this could take a deal
[36:03] of uh you know
[36:05] y'all a bunch of sinners you better
[36:07] judge yourself but you know the thing is
[36:10] is there's so much that goes into what
[36:13] judgment is to a son or daughter of god
[36:16] you know one of the most important
[36:17] things and if the lord would will i want
[36:19] to hit this today is the fact that we
[36:22] would come and judge ourselves by the
[36:24] word and then take what the word said
[36:27] about you amen if we're guilty then say
[36:31] lord forgive me i'm guilty lord forgive
[36:34] me if the word says
[36:37] you're
[36:38] worthy accept god's judgment
[36:42] if the word says that you are healed
[36:45] accept your healing if it says you're
[36:47] delivered except your deliverance if it
[36:49] says that you have been set free if it
[36:52] says that the yoke of bondage has been
[36:54] broken then rejoice in the lord that the
[36:57] yoke is broken
[36:59] amen because the devil will be here just
[37:02] on the opposite side
[37:05] oh sometimes he uses flattery i read a
[37:08] little quotation a few days ago
[37:10] it says and i don't remember all the
[37:12] things that it said so i won't try to do
[37:14] it but it said if the devil can't get
[37:16] you this way
[37:18] and he can't get you this way
[37:20] and he can't get you like this
[37:22] he'll resort to flattery
[37:26] well i'll tell you what
[37:28] i believe in flattery
[37:30] because there is a positive note to
[37:32] flattery
[37:33] you might say oh my
[37:35] your dress is nice it's beautiful your
[37:38] hair is done beautifully those kind of
[37:40] things speak fact though
[37:43] flattery is when we're trying to cover
[37:46] the other story
[37:48] with flowers
[37:50] and get you to accept it
[37:52] amen let's turn our bibles today first
[37:55] peter the fourth chapter
[37:57] once again god bless you to each and
[37:59] every one that's here today
[38:01] amen
[38:03] first peter the fourth chapter
[38:06] now i love this scripture because it
[38:08] really covers
[38:10] a very very broad spectrum
[38:13] uh as this is laid out
[38:15] and first peter 4 12 to start
[38:18] and i think as we start this such a
[38:21] beautiful start you know if you've ever
[38:24] seen people in track or whatever it is
[38:26] and and the pistol is there and they're
[38:29] in the chalks ready to run and
[38:32] the gun goes off and you start to run
[38:35] now i would just say this is a great
[38:37] position to run from
[38:40] beloved
[38:41] think it not strange
[38:44] in other words don't let something be
[38:46] brought up in your mind god doesn't love
[38:48] me why me what is this circumstance i
[38:50] thought being a christian would be like
[38:52] this think it not strange
[38:55] concerning the fiery trial which is to
[38:57] try you
[38:59] as though some strange thing happened
[39:01] unto you
[39:03] no strange thing has happened to you
[39:04] saints i believe every one of us today
[39:06] would say well life has given us some
[39:08] very serious turns
[39:11] but it wasn't strange to god especially
[39:14] and if we're prayed up and we're in the
[39:15] presence of god we're committed to serve
[39:17] him you'll find it's not strange either
[39:20] because god will show you the direction
[39:21] he wants you to go
[39:23] i'll try not to preach all of this
[39:25] scripture
[39:26] but rejoice in as much as ye are
[39:28] partakers of christ's sufferings that
[39:31] when his glory shall be revealed you may
[39:34] be glad also with
[39:36] exceeding joy
[39:38] if he be pro re be reproached for the
[39:41] name of christ happy are ye
[39:44] for the spirit of glory and of god
[39:46] resteth upon you
[39:48] on their part he is evil spoken of but
[39:51] on your part he is glorified now i want
[39:54] you to understand here i'm this is not
[39:56] our thought but i want to express this
[39:58] to you it says on their part he is evil
[40:00] spoken of do you know my brother and
[40:02] sister the prophet of god said that
[40:04] anyone who steps out of this word and
[40:08] takes this word as a contrary
[40:12] is speaking illegal ill of the word of
[40:14] god
[40:16] so they come and false teachers they are
[40:19] speaking ill of god
[40:21] amen men perverting wolf and sheep's
[40:23] clothing perverting the word of god
[40:25] they're speaking ill
[40:28] so you see right there my brother and
[40:29] sister that sometimes things come to
[40:31] pass in the word we don't even give it a
[40:34] thought but on your part he is glorified
[40:36] can someone say amen this morning
[40:39] but let none of you suffer as a murderer
[40:41] or as a thief or as an evil doer or as a
[40:44] bitty busybody in other men's matters
[40:49] yet if any man suffer as a christian let
[40:51] him not be ashamed but let him glorify
[40:55] god on
[40:56] this behalf now here again i want to hit
[40:58] on this look my brother and sister
[41:00] sometimes in life people come along and
[41:03] say well this and this and this happen
[41:06] they must have done something that
[41:08] displeased god they must have been out
[41:11] of the will of god and they are judging
[41:14] this situation not knowing oh they might
[41:18] know the circumstance but they don't
[41:20] know the mind of god
[41:23] and god says you need to go through this
[41:25] fiery trial you need to go through
[41:28] something that others think there must
[41:30] be something behind but god says no i am
[41:34] molding character and i am burning out
[41:37] the dross
[41:39] and so then god allows you to go through
[41:41] that
[41:42] oh if we're not careful we get cold and
[41:44] indifferent to these things because we
[41:46] believe god really doesn't care that
[41:48] much amen
[41:49] for the time has come
[41:52] could this be the time this morning
[41:54] saints
[41:55] for the time has come that judgment must
[41:57] begin at the house of god
[42:00] and if first began at us
[42:04] look at this god put you right at the
[42:05] head of the line
[42:07] amen
[42:08] you see god didn't go judge the world
[42:10] first my brother and sister god's word
[42:12] has judged the bride first
[42:14] and when he declared that the bride has
[42:16] passed the test and the character is
[42:18] molded it doesn't matter what anyone
[42:20] else says because god is our highest
[42:23] authority
[42:24] and so when we come in that position we
[42:26] look now any man
[42:28] who would glory in seeing the world
[42:30] judge for its position needs to go back
[42:33] to the altar it shouldn't break or heart
[42:36] saints it should cause us to be in
[42:38] travail as the scripture says to sigh
[42:41] and cry for those abominations done in
[42:44] the city we should be sawing and crying
[42:47] amen
[42:49] that's what we should be doing
[42:52] for the time has come that judgment
[42:54] judgment must begin at the house of god
[42:57] and if it first begin at us what shall
[42:59] the end be of them that obey not the
[43:02] gospel of god
[43:04] and if the righteous scarcely be saved
[43:06] there where shall the ungodly and the
[43:09] sinner
[43:10] appear
[43:11] wherefore let them that suffer according
[43:13] to the will of god
[43:18] wherefore let them
[43:20] are any of them here yes sir
[43:24] wherefore let them that suffer according
[43:26] to the will of god amen what a
[43:29] tremendous difference yes sir humanity
[43:32] can suffer
[43:34] and it not be
[43:36] the will of god
[43:40] you know what we spoke wednesday we make
[43:42] decisions
[43:46] if we don't weigh
[43:48] what the result of the decision will be
[43:51] before we make the finality of the
[43:53] decision
[43:55] don't act shocked
[43:57] when your decision doesn't yield the
[43:59] result
[44:00] you desire
[44:02] that's why the prophet of god said pray
[44:04] through
[44:05] word of god says pray through find the
[44:08] mind of god find the will of god
[44:12] but we just
[44:14] you know
[44:17] walk into sportsmans and
[44:20] knives are on sale so if one's good two
[44:22] ought to be better
[44:24] three is great
[44:26] four is over the top
[44:28] five your credit card's declined
[44:32] and then we wonder what's going on
[44:37] pray through saints
[44:40] don't take a step
[44:41] before you have
[44:43] prayed through yes sir amen amen i love
[44:46] to sorry to distract you
[44:49] heavenly father lord we just ask you
[44:50] lord today to bless the word
[44:53] lord just touch the hearts of your
[44:54] saints father make the word so real to
[44:56] us
[44:57] lord that the world just disappears
[44:59] behind us
[45:01] lord as we press to the mark of the high
[45:03] calling in christ jesus
[45:05] we thank you today lord we thank you for
[45:07] answered prayers and we thank you for
[45:09] the faith to claim the promise
[45:11] lord just move us forward i pray in the
[45:13] name of jesus christ amen
[45:16] amen
[45:22] don't want to get distracted today
[45:23] saints that's why i cut that off
[45:25] amen
[45:27] now look at this as we look at this
[45:28] scripture
[45:30] i i really my initial focus is on verse
[45:33] 17
[45:34] that uh judgment
[45:37] uh the time has come
[45:39] that judgment must begin in the house of
[45:41] god and you know some people would take
[45:43] this word it's interesting how people's
[45:45] reactions are some people would take
[45:47] this word judgment and they would say
[45:49] yep sure enough the preacher preaching
[45:51] is judging me but really my brother and
[45:53] sister the whole premise of the word of
[45:55] god is not that someone else would judge
[45:58] you and this may seem a little strange
[46:00] to you so please give me a little grace
[46:02] uh here for just a moment but you see
[46:05] it's not that the preacher would judge
[46:07] you and it's not even that the word of
[46:09] god would judge you because the word has
[46:12] showed us very clearly we need to judge
[46:14] ourselves we need to be the one who is
[46:17] reading the word studying the word and
[46:19] then bringing us into a position that we
[46:22] look in the word and say you know what
[46:24] thank you lord i feel
[46:26] you know i feel free i feel liberty or
[46:29] look at the word and say you know
[46:30] there's something pain
[46:32] pinging my heart to say lord i need to
[46:34] up my game and you know forgive me today
[46:37] saints i'll say it this way to you most
[46:39] of us need to up our game amen but god's
[46:42] doing this in such a way he's not here
[46:45] to condemn us he's here just simply to
[46:47] encourage us or strengthen us to move
[46:50] forward and so it's that we come into
[46:52] the house of god now god would cause you
[46:54] to look in your own life anywhere you
[46:56] might be on the face of the earth but
[46:59] the word says that as we see the time or
[47:01] the season approaching do not forsake
[47:05] the assembling of yourselves together
[47:07] because we need the atmosphere we need
[47:10] the moving of god we need rubbing
[47:13] shoulders with saints of like precious
[47:14] faith to to keep that encouragement
[47:17] going because you see the word also
[47:20] warned us that if we were not careful we
[47:22] would become weary in well-doing and the
[47:25] word also declared to us said that there
[47:27] will come a time that if god would not
[47:30] shorten time that all flesh would be
[47:33] lost so we're recognizing my brother and
[47:35] sister not the fact that god would fail
[47:39] we're looking at the fact that our flesh
[47:42] would fail that we would become weary
[47:45] and worn down and that we would look at
[47:47] the things and say i don't believe that
[47:50] this can happen people say i don't know
[47:52] that i can be healed i have been sick
[47:55] for so long well maybe the moment of
[47:57] your healing will come in the moment of
[47:59] your confession that your god is more
[48:02] than able amen because if you look at
[48:04] yourself and you look at your
[48:06] circumstance you will never have the
[48:08] strength to press on
[48:11] you know it's there
[48:13] you know we have lots of examples
[48:15] through the scripture and i just had a
[48:16] couple go through my head but we'll just
[48:18] step beyond that and keep moving forward
[48:21] but look at this as it is so if judgment
[48:24] is beginning in the house of god where
[48:27] will it finish
[48:29] in the house of god i am the alpha and
[48:32] omega so if god began to work in you he
[48:36] has come to finish that work he is not
[48:39] like us that start a project and then
[48:42] somehow the years slip by but god has a
[48:45] very set schedule that is working in
[48:48] your life and it's not upon our thinking
[48:52] but it's upon his plan amen and so it's
[48:55] there if the righteous scarcely be saved
[48:58] now this is not saying that it's coming
[49:00] down to the end and it's almost like
[49:02] fumbling out of god's fingers and he
[49:04] can't quite do it my brother and sister
[49:07] and at the last minute he saves it no
[49:09] sir this is a reflection as i said of
[49:12] the weakness or frailty of flesh and you
[49:16] see sometimes as things come you see
[49:20] like you have experience and watch
[49:22] people's lives on fire
[49:26] the fire cooling down
[49:28] the fire cooling down
[49:31] the fire cooling down
[49:33] the devil says you're not even a
[49:35] christian
[49:36] the truth is all they've got to do is
[49:38] stoke the fire
[49:40] it's not they've got to get saved again
[49:42] get baptized again go through everything
[49:45] again they just need to stoke the fire
[49:48] so what satan does is he fills our time
[49:50] up with enough things and enough stress
[49:52] and enough worries that we forget to
[49:54] stoke the fire
[49:56] and so you know what what sometimes
[49:58] coming into the house of god is people
[50:00] say well seems like the preachers you
[50:02] know they've always preached something
[50:04] before well i would dare to say that
[50:06] there is not one single scripture in
[50:08] this bible that has not been preached
[50:11] thousands of times but it's still alive
[50:13] it's still real and it's still doing the
[50:16] job if we'll allow it to
[50:19] so the issue is not the word that's
[50:21] preached the issue is the condition that
[50:23] we approach it in and so it is my
[50:25] brother and sister i'll say this to you
[50:27] today god did not call you to be
[50:29] mediocre
[50:30] god did not call you to lay down on the
[50:34] job god did not call you to wait till
[50:36] someone would come and bail you out god
[50:40] said i placed a seed in you and what i
[50:43] need you to do is have enough courage to
[50:46] stand up and lay as a worthy seems
[50:48] contradictory to stand up and lay down
[50:50] but to stand up and then lay down in the
[50:53] presence of the sun and allow the life
[50:57] that's in the sun to come in you god
[51:00] placed a lovely natural thing when we
[51:02] come and we were joking about this the
[51:04] other day brother jason's sister emmy
[51:06] and jerry and i how it is you know
[51:08] that's the poor people that live over on
[51:10] the coast
[51:15] some people like that
[51:18] some people love the rain
[51:20] but i happen to be addicted to vitamin d
[51:24] i'm a person that needs to be standing
[51:26] in the sun
[51:27] amen i don't need to be indoors
[51:30] i need to be in the presence of the sun
[51:32] are you with me
[51:33] amen i don't need a covering of some
[51:36] other form of
[51:37] variety i need the presence of the son
[51:41] amen so as you see what god is doing in
[51:44] us he's moving us to come into the
[51:46] correct position
[51:47] amen now let's look right here christ
[51:50] revealed in his own word he said how
[51:52] about a man writing of the greatest king
[51:55] that ever had here on earth as crowned
[51:58] king now let me just preface this for a
[52:00] second those of you are reading stop
[52:06] very rarely
[52:08] will you find someone
[52:10] placing themselves in the negative side
[52:13] of the story
[52:16] it wasn't my fault
[52:19] it was my wife's
[52:22] oh you were fighting yes but it wasn't
[52:24] my fault
[52:30] i thought i'd get an amen out of that
[52:39] how about a man writing of the greatest
[52:41] king that ever had here on earth as
[52:43] crown king david in his committing
[52:46] adultery
[52:48] hmm
[52:49] what those jews ever wrote
[52:51] of their most noble king being an
[52:54] adulteress
[52:55] oh we have history like george
[52:57] washington never told the lie see what
[53:00] brother brahm's doing he's saying look
[53:02] we we have our way of putting this
[53:04] george washington never told a lie
[53:09] george did you chop down the cherry tree
[53:12] no dad
[53:14] the acts did
[53:17] who is behind the axe george
[53:20] some hands
[53:21] is he never wanting to come to make the
[53:23] admission
[53:25] of our part of this oh we have history
[53:28] like george washington never told the
[53:29] lion things like that and we say call
[53:31] that history but this is a man a bible
[53:34] that calls david an adulteress and he
[53:37] was the king of israel an adulteress who
[53:39] was to be the son
[53:41] jesus to be the son of david the very
[53:43] headstone and his father according to
[53:45] the flesh was an adulteress jews would
[53:48] never wrote a book like that would man
[53:51] write this of his own self certainly
[53:54] not yeah right certainly not
[54:00] how would that proud nation of israel
[54:02] you know how proud they were proud
[54:04] nation of israel went and wrote about
[54:06] their own idolatry wrote about their own
[54:10] rebellion against their god wrote
[54:12] against the dirty filthy things that
[54:14] they did and wrote out in a book they
[54:17] have sure hid that
[54:19] they have just showed the good things
[54:23] but this bible that tells what's right
[54:25] and what's wrong it's anyone knows that
[54:28] the jews would never wrote a book like
[54:29] that about their own uncleanness and
[54:32] idolatry and failure and everything they
[54:34] had they'd had never wrote that oh no
[54:37] then who wrote it the bible
[54:40] said in hebrews 1 1 god in sundry times
[54:44] and divers manners spake to the fathers
[54:46] through the prophets then it wasn't the
[54:49] prophets it wasn't mortal god not
[54:52] prophets in sundry time but god in
[54:55] sundry time and divers manners spoke to
[54:57] the fathers through the promise through
[55:00] the prophets amen so you look at this
[55:03] and what we recognize my brother and
[55:05] sister this is not the nature of man to
[55:09] take our life and we would deem
[55:12] ourselves justified now you know i
[55:14] oftenly joke about that that men would
[55:17] have an attitude and they would sing
[55:19] their own version of the song i'm
[55:20] justified i'm justified they're not
[55:23] talking about god coming down and doing
[55:25] a mighty work in their life they're
[55:26] coming to a place that they are
[55:28] justifying their position and so it's in
[55:31] that justification we do this now
[55:35] have you ever noticed
[55:38] that when something happens in your life
[55:40] and you know you should go apologize
[55:43] oftentimes if you don't deal with it
[55:45] right away you will never deal with it
[55:48] if you're not moved on in the spirit to
[55:50] turn and go and say i am sorry
[55:53] then you will never deal with that
[55:56] because what happens the very nature of
[55:58] man starts to justify our own behavior
[56:01] justify the circumstance and why and we
[56:04] will then start you know as the
[56:06] insurance companies in the day and age
[56:08] we live in it is uh something that's you
[56:10] might say a relatively newer concept but
[56:13] they want to assign portions of blame so
[56:16] if you get in an auto accident literally
[56:18] they want to discount by about 20
[56:21] percent the the issue right off the bat
[56:24] because you left the house that day in a
[56:26] car
[56:27] if you had not went to work you had not
[56:29] gone to the grocery store you had not
[56:31] went to whatever and you had left the
[56:33] car in the garage this accident would
[56:35] never happen therefore it's at least 20
[56:38] 25 percent your fault
[56:42] what are they doing justifying
[56:45] they're trying to take part of the blame
[56:48] from themselves
[56:49] and they're trying to push it over
[56:51] somewhere else now my brother and sister
[56:53] we can look at this and i hope you catch
[56:55] this this morning we can look at this in
[56:57] the spiritual realm and sometimes well
[56:59] anybody that's human please raise a hand
[57:02] today amen you know some of you won't
[57:04] lift a hand so therefore i'm suspect
[57:06] whether you're human or not but anyway
[57:08] you look at this and realize anyone
[57:10] that's human makes mistakes and so as we
[57:13] move through life what happens is my
[57:16] brother and sister we we come to where
[57:18] we kind of tend to justify certain
[57:20] things well they did this so i did this
[57:23] i reacted this way because of this and
[57:25] you see what it is that it is satan
[57:28] coming and he's trying to bring it to
[57:30] the place because the scripture shows us
[57:33] that without a full repentance not
[57:35] partial amen not assigning 25 to this
[57:39] one to that one and we'll blame the
[57:41] devil at least 50 percent but we you
[57:43] know no the thing is regardless of
[57:46] whether you got caught in a trap the
[57:47] devil set you up or not god is requiring
[57:50] a hundred percent confession of
[57:53] repentance he's not looking for
[57:55] something where the blame has been
[57:57] assigned a little here and a little
[57:58] there i reacted like i did because of
[58:01] what the wife did come on my brother and
[58:03] sister i reacted like this because of
[58:05] what the devil did we should outgrow
[58:08] that and i say lord help paul amen
[58:10] because there's a time that we must come
[58:12] and it is there i've seen a little
[58:14] quotation just in the last few days that
[58:16] it is our recognition and acceptance of
[58:20] who it is to blame
[58:22] is what brings us the ability to change
[58:25] it
[58:26] amen
[58:33] if you don't accept it you can't change
[58:35] it
[58:40] so this is the nature of man just what
[58:42] we see right here
[58:45] hide the rebellion
[58:48] boast
[58:49] of the charity
[58:53] had the faults
[58:55] boast
[58:56] of the good things
[58:59] now you see
[59:00] judgment beginning in the house of god
[59:03] is bringing us to a place that we have
[59:05] to stop and say okay i'm a part of this
[59:08] equation
[59:09] now look my brother and sister unless we
[59:11] get kind of sad looking here this
[59:12] morning and some of you are you have to
[59:14] recognize that the seed that god placed
[59:16] in you before the foundation of the
[59:18] world is the seed that will take you out
[59:21] of this world amen it is not the present
[59:24] circumstance it is not the present
[59:26] failures you don't need to assign blame
[59:29] you don't need to do what we need to do
[59:31] is learn to rebuke the devil stay with
[59:33] the word and stand on the promises of
[59:36] god because god's already said this work
[59:38] is finished that was a beautiful song to
[59:40] fit with our sermon today it's already
[59:42] done but you see as long as we are in a
[59:46] realm that we feel compelled to blame or
[59:49] to put it somewhere else we're actually
[59:51] oh i hope you get this we're actually
[59:53] judging them and not ourself
[59:56] god wants us to judge ourselves so if
[1:00:00] judgment begins in the house of god that
[1:00:03] means you must come in these doors to
[1:00:05] start judgment no sir the house of god
[1:00:07] is in you so it's there that we must
[1:00:10] come back and go back to the throne that
[1:00:13] god has called us to and that throne is
[1:00:15] not an altar somewhere we don't have a
[1:00:17] place that we call mecca it is a place
[1:00:20] that we come in our own life in our own
[1:00:23] play and come to the lord and say lord
[1:00:25] judge me lord clean me lord now look my
[1:00:28] brother and sister when we would come
[1:00:30] some people say well i don't want to ask
[1:00:31] the lord to judge me
[1:00:34] well i'm going to tell you until you
[1:00:35] come to the place that you ask god to
[1:00:37] judge you you'll never change
[1:00:40] because you and your flesh are not
[1:00:42] compelled
[1:00:43] to judge yourself
[1:00:45] you and your flesh are not compelled to
[1:00:49] accept your own weakness or failure it
[1:00:52] is christ in you and the more that you
[1:00:54] come in the presence of god we start to
[1:00:56] judge ourselves now just speaking to
[1:00:58] this young lady here the last few days i
[1:01:01] asked her i said would you please
[1:01:03] just go back examine your life you want
[1:01:05] to see your son stay healed i mean you
[1:01:08] want to see him heal now go back in your
[1:01:10] own life and start going through your
[1:01:13] life and lay it before the lord and so
[1:01:15] in that realm right there we're not
[1:01:17] condemning we're not judging because you
[1:01:20] see it's the individual affair people
[1:01:22] say well i heard the preacher preach and
[1:01:24] he judged me no you didn't hear the
[1:01:26] preacher judge you you heard your own
[1:01:28] conscience convicting you
[1:01:30] amen
[1:01:32] because if a man has the ability to
[1:01:34] bring a conviction in your heart as a
[1:01:38] man then imagine the power that we would
[1:01:40] have over humanity we would just simply
[1:01:43] hand out conviction everywhere and as it
[1:01:45] would be with good intention everyone
[1:01:47] would be saved
[1:01:49] but you see it's the word of god that
[1:01:52] has the power to bring conviction and
[1:01:55] causes us to judge now so we don't want
[1:01:58] to hide our rebellion and boast of our
[1:02:00] charity
[1:02:01] now i want to look back for just a
[1:02:03] minute in the book of esther if you
[1:02:04] don't mind we won't turn to it but you
[1:02:07] see haman has such a clever plan
[1:02:10] that he is actually coming to the king
[1:02:12] in such a fashion and it makes it look
[1:02:16] as though that by destroying the jews he
[1:02:20] is doing a favor or a blessing for the
[1:02:23] king
[1:02:24] he's now placed it in such a way that if
[1:02:28] i was to clean the kingdom out of the
[1:02:31] with these rebellious people that you
[1:02:33] know a little money involved a little
[1:02:35] ring to mark a signet to seal it all and
[1:02:38] and it's like i'm doing good now look at
[1:02:41] the devil he's taken this approach that
[1:02:43] by weeding out and pointing out the
[1:02:45] faults of the people that he is kind of
[1:02:48] presenting it as though i i am i'm doing
[1:02:52] god a favor and so it's in that realm he
[1:02:55] brings people to the point that then
[1:02:57] they become under a judgmental spirit
[1:03:00] believing they're doing god's business
[1:03:03] when they point out everyone's faults oh
[1:03:05] you see where that spirit comes from god
[1:03:07] help us we probably all had it on us at
[1:03:09] one time or another but look at that now
[1:03:11] see so as satan's making it look like
[1:03:14] that by putting out uh showing
[1:03:16] everyone's deal i want to just be
[1:03:18] redundant here that we're doing he was
[1:03:20] doing a favor to the king
[1:03:23] in reality he had a great bitterness or
[1:03:25] hatred for mordecai
[1:03:28] now there's a lot of jews as it were in
[1:03:30] the kingdom he'd never met but because
[1:03:32] mordecai was a jew and he
[1:03:36] disliked mordecai so much
[1:03:38] he was then going to exact judgment now
[1:03:41] my brother and sister there's a lot of
[1:03:42] christians the devil's never met
[1:03:49] you're probably wondering what in the
[1:03:50] world did paul just say
[1:03:53] well that's all another sermon but my
[1:03:55] brother and sister i can take you right
[1:03:57] in the word of god and show you that
[1:03:59] until you come from under cover
[1:04:03] until you climb out of the bush or the
[1:04:05] closet or the whatever you've been
[1:04:07] hiding in
[1:04:08] the devil doesn't even know you're a
[1:04:10] christian
[1:04:12] you see you're a christian when you
[1:04:14] stand up and you actually do something
[1:04:17] when you stand for the word amen that is
[1:04:20] people say do something i'll be a
[1:04:21] missionary i'll be there no stand up and
[1:04:24] stand for the word
[1:04:26] that's when the satan starts to fight
[1:04:28] you you realize many a individual that
[1:04:31] has said for years i'm a christian i'm a
[1:04:33] christian and their life is good nothing
[1:04:35] no problems everything just goes along
[1:04:37] real great well my brother and sister
[1:04:39] the devil's not bothering them because
[1:04:41] they've never made a stand
[1:04:43] but the minute you stand up and start
[1:04:45] fighting back and getting in out of
[1:04:47] flesh and blood and into the spiritual
[1:04:49] warfare the devil is going to throw
[1:04:52] every hand grenade in hell at you
[1:04:55] because when you start to manifest the
[1:04:58] fact that i really am going to live the
[1:05:00] word then he gets nervous then he gets
[1:05:03] concerned then he challenges you then he
[1:05:06] tries to undermine you then he assaults
[1:05:08] you face to face it's then that he does
[1:05:11] that but as long as you're just in
[1:05:12] hibernation
[1:05:17] you know
[1:05:18] i got some good friends that own
[1:05:19] orchards
[1:05:22] my friend dar
[1:05:24] he's like you know
[1:05:26] paul he was actually speaking to us
[1:05:28] to me
[1:05:30] you know that little cherry tree you got
[1:05:31] in your yard paul
[1:05:33] yeah
[1:05:35] i don't like people like you
[1:05:38] really door
[1:05:40] he said yeah
[1:05:43] because people like you don't realize
[1:05:44] there's a problem with the pest until
[1:05:46] the pest is already a problem
[1:05:51] and as an orchard as they go and spray
[1:05:52] crop oil and that smothers a lot of
[1:05:55] those larvae that are laying up in the
[1:05:57] trees and when the oil gets in there it
[1:05:59] blocks off the oxygen and that see
[1:06:02] the time to treat the past
[1:06:06] is before it comes
[1:06:09] to maturity
[1:06:11] because when it comes to maturity
[1:06:14] the way you have to treat the pest then
[1:06:17] it's not you might say acceptable
[1:06:21] can i put that in terms of the church
[1:06:23] sometimes when there's an outbreak in
[1:06:25] the church
[1:06:26] and the past starts to show up
[1:06:29] then you have to go in there almost
[1:06:31] toxically
[1:06:32] and deal with it and then the people who
[1:06:34] are innocent are saying why am i being
[1:06:36] sprayed as it were with all of this
[1:06:39] forceful and powerful and cutting and
[1:06:43] whatever it is you don't realize see the
[1:06:44] pest wasn't dealt with and that's why
[1:06:46] god wants us to continually in our own
[1:06:48] life i used as a church concept there
[1:06:51] but in our own life god doesn't want it
[1:06:54] to wait until it has become a full-blown
[1:06:56] pest in our life god wants us to deal
[1:06:58] with it early and if we'll go and judge
[1:07:01] ourselves and it's hard saints look
[1:07:04] let's admit it it's hard stand in the
[1:07:06] mirror of god's word and accept the fact
[1:07:08] that you have deficiency in your life
[1:07:11] and it's just kind of like well but but
[1:07:13] our response is i i know we've used this
[1:07:16] a time but i've been a christian for a
[1:07:18] certain amount of time i've been say
[1:07:20] i've been in message for this or i've
[1:07:22] had the holy ghost none of those words
[1:07:25] are relevant if you haven't dealt with
[1:07:26] the past if you haven't stopped and
[1:07:29] examined and went through every portion
[1:07:31] of your life to deal with that past then
[1:07:33] it doesn't matter what you declare
[1:07:35] against it
[1:07:36] amen
[1:07:38] i tell you sister jerry and i down in
[1:07:40] south america
[1:07:41] as the brothers they're kind of a little
[1:07:43] bit of edge to their voice
[1:07:46] i said wow we were in the grocery store
[1:07:48] i said this to a brother i said we're in
[1:07:49] the grocery store and we went to buy a
[1:07:51] couple apples and boy they all look like
[1:07:53] they've been beat up and stuff and the
[1:07:54] brother looks at me and goes that's
[1:07:56] because we sent the good stuff
[1:07:58] to you
[1:08:00] oh excuse me
[1:08:02] but you see my brother and sister
[1:08:05] that apple with those little scrapes
[1:08:07] and dents
[1:08:09] it's just as new
[1:08:12] that is just as good
[1:08:14] so god's not even looking for the
[1:08:16] christian without a mark or a scuff upon
[1:08:18] him god's looking for the christian
[1:08:20] that's willing to give himself
[1:08:24] willing to receive of the word
[1:08:28] so i just want to i just want to point
[1:08:31] this back saints
[1:08:35] satan wants it make it look like us
[1:08:37] pointing out everyone's failures that
[1:08:40] we're doing a favor to the king
[1:08:42] but actually we're doing satan a favor
[1:08:44] amen not only does it undermine us
[1:08:47] but it undermines everyone who hears
[1:08:49] those words and the individual being
[1:08:51] spoken of
[1:08:52] now look my brother and sister going
[1:08:55] still on this thought from esther during
[1:08:57] this time i type haman as satan here but
[1:09:00] during this time satan is declaring our
[1:09:03] faults before the throne
[1:09:06] you know you take uh you take the
[1:09:09] examples of scripture and and job you
[1:09:12] know uh uh job had no clue saints that
[1:09:15] that satan was there having that
[1:09:17] conversation with god and he had no clue
[1:09:20] that god was saying oh here no problem
[1:09:23] i'll open the hedge and in that what did
[1:09:27] his friends do they started to judge him
[1:09:29] they said well you have a secret sin job
[1:09:32] there must be something in your life you
[1:09:34] have done wrong even his own wife said
[1:09:37] you know why don't you why don't you
[1:09:39] just curse god and die now my brother
[1:09:41] and sister this you say well i read that
[1:09:44] and it's just so horrible but do you
[1:09:46] know that spirit is still alive in the
[1:09:48] 21st century and it's a time that people
[1:09:51] come and the thing is is we need to look
[1:09:54] to god's will in our life and judge
[1:09:57] ourselves in the mirror of god's word
[1:09:59] and maybe not look at everyone else
[1:10:01] quite so much
[1:10:02] now i'm not talking about gross sin
[1:10:04] coming in the church that's why i was
[1:10:05] talking earlier we have to make sure
[1:10:07] that we treat this so that gross sin
[1:10:09] doesn't come in the church but sometimes
[1:10:11] our weaknesses now i know most of us
[1:10:14] including myself okay we have a real
[1:10:16] hard time confessing our faults
[1:10:19] one to another
[1:10:21] when people start standing up and i i've
[1:10:24] been there actually sister jerry's in
[1:10:25] the service but she might not have heard
[1:10:27] the words but to see you know a family
[1:10:30] come up you know to the brother that
[1:10:33] ministered and just to pour out
[1:10:36] everything i mean they hung their
[1:10:37] laundry to the wind that day and people
[1:10:40] would be oh i couldn't do that but you
[1:10:42] would if the seed inside you was trying
[1:10:45] to push out if the seed inside you said
[1:10:48] i must live i must get in the presence
[1:10:51] of the sun then it is in those cases
[1:10:54] that one is able to then just bear their
[1:10:56] soul and to pour it out you see it's
[1:10:58] that that god brings us to sometimes we
[1:11:01] need to come to a time that shame has no
[1:11:04] value our reproach of our own reputation
[1:11:07] has no value how people would think and
[1:11:10] speak and whatever of us means nothing
[1:11:13] to us any longer because we must get in
[1:11:15] the presence of the son we judge
[1:11:18] ourselves needy of god more than media
[1:11:21] of reputation of the flesh
[1:11:23] but so many times the moving of the holy
[1:11:25] spirit is stopped because people would
[1:11:27] say what will people think that's
[1:11:29] exactly right what do people think what
[1:11:31] will they think
[1:11:34] what do you care
[1:11:35] amen i mean when it comes to the time
[1:11:37] that we're judged of the word
[1:11:41] and here's the bus going to hell
[1:11:44] you're not going to be excited that they
[1:11:46] congratulate you to be on that bus
[1:11:50] but the harder battle the harder fight
[1:11:54] is to find
[1:11:55] under the banner
[1:11:57] that god has given you amen not just as
[1:12:00] a christian that's valuable we are
[1:12:02] christians
[1:12:03] but to be able to stand and say i am
[1:12:05] blood bought
[1:12:07] i have been committed and purchased by
[1:12:10] jesus christ i am his own i am his bride
[1:12:14] i belong to him and the world today
[1:12:17] increasingly doesn't like that they've
[1:12:18] watered that down that everything's a
[1:12:20] christian
[1:12:23] that's right
[1:12:29] you know the devil's pretty sly old guy
[1:12:31] isn't he
[1:12:32] get us to do his work for him
[1:12:36] reminds me years ago i think that was
[1:12:37] like what is it tom sawyer or whatever
[1:12:41] is that right huckleberry finn whatever
[1:12:43] tom sawyer huckleberry finn
[1:12:45] you know here why don't you paint while
[1:12:47] i tell you this
[1:12:48] story why don't you do this while i tell
[1:12:51] you about that
[1:12:53] i'll give you a nickel or something for
[1:12:54] this and you know in the end what was
[1:12:56] always getting someone else to do the
[1:12:58] work and the devil has come down and
[1:13:00] many times we say well we want to keep
[1:13:02] division out of the church we want to
[1:13:04] keep spirits out of the church the devil
[1:13:06] doesn't come in my brother and sister
[1:13:08] and do that we haul him in we let him in
[1:13:10] we bring him with us
[1:13:12] we're supposed to be coming to the house
[1:13:13] of god and bringing the spirit of christ
[1:13:16] with us bringing the holy ghost fire
[1:13:18] with us instead we come in the house of
[1:13:21] god doing the devil's work for him and i
[1:13:23] say god forgive us
[1:13:25] god forgive us
[1:13:26] and it comes in these little things my
[1:13:28] brother and sister
[1:13:31] little things it's not the big things
[1:13:32] it's the little things
[1:13:35] amen i say let this judgment first begin
[1:13:38] at us right
[1:13:39] for the time has come i like verse 17
[1:13:42] for the time is come
[1:13:44] amen maybe there was a season that there
[1:13:47] wasn't but the time is come and if there
[1:13:50] was ever a season that we ought to be
[1:13:52] getting ourselves clean righteous and
[1:13:54] holy before the lord this is the season
[1:13:57] my brother and sister the word says we
[1:13:59] would come to a time and a place that we
[1:14:01] would loathe even the dirt as it were on
[1:14:04] the hymn of our garment much less
[1:14:07] anywhere else god help us that we would
[1:14:09] come to a place that even the hymn of
[1:14:12] our garment is cleansed before the lord
[1:14:14] i say lord help me this morning
[1:14:17] help me this morning amen
[1:14:19] hallelujah
[1:14:21] you know we can declare satan bound just
[1:14:24] as much as we want
[1:14:27] we can pray the prayer we bind you satan
[1:14:29] in the name of jesus christ seven sons
[1:14:32] of siva found out that didn't work so
[1:14:34] good
[1:14:35] they thought that merely mouthing the
[1:14:37] words would be sufficient to bind the
[1:14:39] devil but mouthing the words my brother
[1:14:42] and sister is something anyone can do
[1:14:44] but a son or daughter of god filled with
[1:14:47] the holy ghost is there any in our house
[1:14:49] this morning hallelujah amen but the
[1:14:52] real binding comes when we bring
[1:14:54] ourselves in subjection to the word and
[1:14:56] when we're in subjection to the word and
[1:14:59] we bind satan he's bound
[1:15:02] satan cannot overcome the word the word
[1:15:04] is so more powerful than the devil in
[1:15:07] his minion but if we are not subjected
[1:15:10] to the word then we are mouthing words
[1:15:12] just like those seven sons of siva
[1:15:15] god help us
[1:15:17] you see the word over and over i've just
[1:15:19] touched upon these things lightly here
[1:15:22] but the word here my brother and sister
[1:15:24] shows us over and over again we must
[1:15:26] place ourselves in the correct position
[1:15:30] you want to get results you got to be in
[1:15:32] the correct position
[1:15:35] amen
[1:15:37] hallelujah
[1:15:41] hallelujah
[1:15:44] jesus keeps all of his appointments
[1:15:47] and he took the note and read it and we
[1:15:48] find out that this is talking about
[1:15:50] jesus and we find out that this certain
[1:15:52] pharisee hatter was making a feast and
[1:15:55] had bid him to come down and be a guest
[1:15:57] of honor with him
[1:15:59] so jesus standing for a few moments and
[1:16:02] looking at the young man the one that
[1:16:03] brought the invitation
[1:16:05] and yet as busy as he was but you can
[1:16:08] never invite him but what he'll come can
[1:16:12] someone say amen to that we invite our
[1:16:14] lord jesus on the scene he will
[1:16:19] sir that's come
[1:16:20] right
[1:16:26] yet as busy as he was but you can never
[1:16:28] invite him but what he'll come i don't
[1:16:30] care what the situation is he'll come
[1:16:32] and he said you tell your master that
[1:16:34] i'll be there on this certain day at
[1:16:36] this certain time i'll be there and the
[1:16:38] courier must have smiled satisfied and
[1:16:40] turned away and run off down the hill to
[1:16:42] take the good news back to his master
[1:16:45] that he had succeeded in getting the
[1:16:46] message to the one that he wanted
[1:16:53] what was the matter with that courier
[1:16:57] how could it be
[1:17:00] was he conscious of what he had done the
[1:17:02] first time maybe in his life that he
[1:17:03] ever stood in the presence of jesus
[1:17:06] and never even asked forgiveness of his
[1:17:09] sins
[1:17:11] he never took the opportunity
[1:17:13] that's the same way with people today
[1:17:15] many times they realize that they're in
[1:17:17] his presence
[1:17:18] and they never ask forgiveness that's
[1:17:20] right
[1:17:22] see this is why judgment is not placed
[1:17:24] is i got to be in the church as it were
[1:17:27] the judgment is not placed i must be
[1:17:29] under a certain ministry
[1:17:30] i must be here it has to be this it is
[1:17:33] when we come in his presence we should
[1:17:38] ask him to judge our life and be able to
[1:17:41] say lord i feel your presence that's why
[1:17:43] sometimes saints the presence of god we
[1:17:46] would acknowledge right here in this
[1:17:47] church and say god is here we feel his
[1:17:50] presence but we'll walk out with the
[1:17:51] same bitter spirit we walked in with we
[1:17:54] walk out with the same insecurity and
[1:17:57] fear we walked in with and we say we
[1:17:59] were in his presence today that's the
[1:18:02] moment that we should surrender lift our
[1:18:04] hands and say oh lord forgive me lord
[1:18:07] cleanse my heart lord make my life to be
[1:18:10] the image of what you want it to be
[1:18:13] but instead
[1:18:14] come on saints i'm speaking truth to you
[1:18:17] instead we just sit there with these
[1:18:19] spirits on us and base
[1:18:22] in the presence hey isn't this so
[1:18:24] wonderful god is here god is here
[1:18:27] god is here
[1:18:29] and we walk out
[1:18:32] with the same issues
[1:18:34] in our lives
[1:18:37] heaven help us
[1:18:39] right when his presence comes that's the
[1:18:41] time to stop and say lord judge me
[1:18:45] judge me lord that i would see my faults
[1:18:48] and my failures i don't need the
[1:18:50] preacher to call my name i don't need
[1:18:52] someone to say i have a prophecy over
[1:18:54] you we can just come in that present and
[1:18:56] say lord forgive me amen that's right
[1:18:59] wash me lord
[1:19:01] [Applause]
[1:19:03] exactly right
[1:19:05] oh hallelujah
[1:19:07] hallelujah amen
[1:19:10] realize they're in his presence never
[1:19:11] ask forgiveness
[1:19:13] well he maybe never presented the
[1:19:15] opportunity another time
[1:19:17] and turned down his last opportunity to
[1:19:19] ask forgiveness amen how could he have
[1:19:22] ever done that how could this boy ever
[1:19:25] been so wrapped up in bringing this
[1:19:29] message
[1:19:34] amen pray for the preacher yes sir
[1:19:39] pray for the preacher he brings a
[1:19:40] message
[1:19:41] but that doesn't mean he's always in the
[1:19:43] right spirit the right attitude dealing
[1:19:45] with little things in his own life that
[1:19:47] he can't bear them out because he's the
[1:19:49] preacher
[1:19:53] but the one bringing the message
[1:19:56] do you follow me
[1:19:58] the one bringing this message from his
[1:20:00] master that he failed in the presence of
[1:20:02] the son of god to ask forgiveness it was
[1:20:04] all
[1:20:06] a business
[1:20:07] affair
[1:20:09] oh my goodness when did church
[1:20:12] that's it
[1:20:15] what's on the right one
[1:20:18] i've got lost here
[1:20:23] business fair that's right okay
[1:20:25] sorry
[1:20:26] and you know that's something like the
[1:20:28] people today church
[1:20:30] christ has become a business affair or a
[1:20:33] social affair a joined church and just
[1:20:35] get a little better social standing for
[1:20:37] your business or something you sound a
[1:20:39] little better in the neighborhood
[1:20:41] you know this is where i put that
[1:20:42] thought that i shared with you earlier
[1:20:44] see it is there my brother and sister
[1:20:46] that we come sometimes and we'll find
[1:20:49] ourselves coming in this and we we are
[1:20:52] so worried about that right we hide the
[1:20:54] rebellion and we boast of the charity
[1:20:59] well my chur my business i mean you know
[1:21:01] we we gave 5 000
[1:21:04] to the youth group
[1:21:07] i can tell you of a man and this sounds
[1:21:08] judgmental but i say this and it's
[1:21:10] factual and i can prove it a man in this
[1:21:12] city right here worth millions
[1:21:14] worth millions will cut you off at the
[1:21:17] knees in business but received a huge
[1:21:19] plaque and it's in their church to this
[1:21:21] day right now for repaving the parking
[1:21:23] lot and putting up new lights and
[1:21:25] everything worth hundreds and hundreds
[1:21:27] and hundreds of thousands of dollars but
[1:21:29] i'll tell you got the hundreds and
[1:21:31] hundreds of thousands of dollars by
[1:21:32] ripping off everyone he did business
[1:21:35] with
[1:21:36] and even in his own church people won't
[1:21:38] do business with him
[1:21:42] i'd rather be
[1:21:43] poverty-stricken
[1:21:45] have a broom and sweep the parking lot
[1:21:49] and be right with god
[1:21:51] than to give hundreds of thousands of
[1:21:53] dollars
[1:21:54] and have art and animosities and
[1:21:57] bitternesses with my fellow man that's
[1:21:59] exactly right amen
[1:22:02] stand out a little better in the
[1:22:03] neighborhood
[1:22:04] it isn't a thing of really coming and
[1:22:06] repenting like a sinner should do many
[1:22:09] times in church people are brought right
[1:22:11] in the presence of christ and turn away
[1:22:13] and do his rash a thing as his courier
[1:22:16] did oh he should have fell upon his
[1:22:18] knees when he first realized that it was
[1:22:20] it was who he was and saying master i
[1:22:23] have a message for you but first i want
[1:22:25] you to forgive me that would have been
[1:22:27] the right approach but then if there's
[1:22:29] any business to be done let that be done
[1:22:32] later but the first is get his own soul
[1:22:34] right with god and i want to put this
[1:22:37] right before you today you got a serious
[1:22:40] need in your life you need god to come
[1:22:42] and touch you financial marital
[1:22:45] spiritual
[1:22:46] physical whatever it is don't just
[1:22:49] approach god like it's a business fair
[1:22:51] now lord i need you to do this this this
[1:22:53] and this and lord if you come and you do
[1:22:56] that can you come over here and take
[1:22:57] care of this my brother and sister our
[1:22:59] first job is to get right in the
[1:23:02] presence of god and climb in there what

[1:23:18] then she wrapped herself in the royal
[1:23:21] garment which is the word of god and it
[1:23:24] wrapped in that word then she come and
[1:23:28] she didn't come to the throne and when
[1:23:30] he reached the scepter out to her and
[1:23:32] she touched it she didn't start right in

[1:24:11] she prepared now whether her hands in
[1:24:13] the natural actually cut up and did all
[1:24:15] of that or whether she was there to

[1:24:21] how to reach out to the lord mama
[1:24:24] daddy

[1:24:27] you're the supervisor preparing the
[1:24:29] atmosphere for god to come and do
[1:24:31] something supernatural oh help us
[1:24:35] help us if it's not for us then help us
[1:24:37] lord to be a good supervisor a good
[1:24:39] guide in this time
[1:24:41] hallelujah
[1:24:44] see
[1:24:45] we look at this my brother and sister
[1:24:47] there it is
[1:24:48] they come but first get his own soul
[1:24:50] right with god
[1:24:52] how that young man would have been
[1:24:54] so blessed
[1:24:56] amen so blessed
[1:25:00] the fetus said um
[1:25:03] i heard about you
[1:25:06] you're jesus
[1:25:09] and said it was like hey jesus here i
[1:25:11] got a message for you
[1:25:12] well i'm telling you my brother and
[1:25:14] sister god's the one
[1:25:15] that sends the message
[1:25:17] it's not man that sends the message
[1:25:20] it's god that sends the message
[1:25:22] we don't have a message
[1:25:24] for god
[1:25:25] we have petitions amen we share to our
[1:25:29] king
[1:25:30] are you with me today hallelujah
[1:25:34] oh my
[1:25:37] oh
[1:25:38] my
[1:25:40] so what happens people start declaring
[1:25:43] i bound the devil
[1:25:45] but because of their position the devil
[1:25:47] actually has bound them
[1:25:50] you know i love the word
[1:25:52] how it lays it out father
[1:25:56] teach us how to pray
[1:25:59] teach us how
[1:26:02] i think even today i found myself the
[1:26:05] other day saints
[1:26:06] a little stressful situation
[1:26:09] i found myself
[1:26:10] saying on the order of lord i need you
[1:26:14] to do this
[1:26:16] something checked in my heart
[1:26:18] said you are approaching god
[1:26:20] incorrectly
[1:26:24] first off lord
[1:26:28] i want to come to you correctly amen
[1:26:31] wash me lord
[1:26:33] let me come to you in the right way
[1:26:36] you're my king you're my lord you're my
[1:26:37] savior you're my all in all
[1:26:40] see what happened right there saints i'm
[1:26:42] not boasting on myself because i
[1:26:43] actually felt very checked in my heart
[1:26:45] i'm not boasting myself don't think that
[1:26:47] but you see the lord took me into the
[1:26:49] judgment seat and said you're not
[1:26:51] approaching me but because i love you as
[1:26:53] much as i love you i'm not going to just
[1:26:55] put you away i'm going to tell you and
[1:26:58] remind you and show you you're asking
[1:27:01] you're demanding your
[1:27:03] incentivized for me to do something for
[1:27:05] you without any praise any worship any
[1:27:08] love
[1:27:10] amen i'm telling you saints are you with
[1:27:12] me there's times it's hard to go into
[1:27:15] the judgment room
[1:27:17] there's times it's hard to have the
[1:27:20] the word of the lord come back to you
[1:27:22] and say you know you you're you're off
[1:27:23] base boy amen oh we don't like that we
[1:27:26] like god to just pour blessings out on
[1:27:28] us don't we
[1:27:29] amen
[1:27:31] okay hallelujah
[1:27:34] i am so lost
[1:27:35] whoa okay thank you brothers
[1:27:38] that's why i think so much healing
[1:27:40] becomes a failure or professed healing
[1:27:43] because the first place the people are
[1:27:44] not ready for healing
[1:27:47] they won't confess their wrongs
[1:27:50] i'm not speaking on this young lady that
[1:27:52] was here the other day but this is why
[1:27:54] you speak and say you know what please i
[1:27:56] didn't demand of her please go in your
[1:27:59] prayer closet your bedroom whatever it
[1:28:01] is get down before god and say lord
[1:28:04] cleanse me
[1:28:06] get me prepared lord i want to do the
[1:28:08] right thing that you would come and heal
[1:28:11] my son
[1:28:13] yes
[1:28:14] and i believe her heart her heart's
[1:28:16] desire is there amen the bible said
[1:28:19] confess your faults one to another and
[1:28:21] pray one for another one for the other
[1:28:24] and we're not willing to do that
[1:28:29] yes sir that's exactly right
[1:28:31] i know it's some boastful saints but you
[1:28:33] know why often times the close of a
[1:28:35] service i encourage you when you leave
[1:28:36] pray for one another
[1:28:39] because we got to break this barrier
[1:28:40] down we got to break this satan's there
[1:28:44] trying to put the
[1:28:45] the blocks up to get this that i go to
[1:28:48] church there and we fellowship and we do
[1:28:50] this but
[1:28:51] i kind of care less whether i'm with the
[1:28:53] saints or not i do my own thing no
[1:28:56] satan's building a fence for you amen
[1:28:58] come on
[1:29:00] we're not willing to do that if we can
[1:29:01] take the healing and go ahead and go
[1:29:03] back and do what he was doing they would
[1:29:06] accept that in other words i want to
[1:29:07] just come here preacher pray for me i
[1:29:09] want healed and i want to just go on and
[1:29:11] do my life
[1:29:12] oh no god wants something out of you
[1:29:15] amen he paid for you
[1:29:17] hallelujah he paid for you
[1:29:24] but when it comes to really first coming
[1:29:26] and getting right with god people don't
[1:29:28] want to do that that's the reason it
[1:29:30] throws a bad damper over divine healing
[1:29:33] you see so many people walk
[1:29:35] in line
[1:29:36] that walk in like that and walk out and
[1:29:39] don't and god knows all about those
[1:29:41] things amen
[1:29:42] oh
[1:29:44] yeah imagine
[1:29:45] people would be like i don't i don't
[1:29:47] think that that's real i never got
[1:29:49] healed i went there
[1:29:52] remember the man
[1:29:54] mocking
[1:29:56] said take that little girls how come he
[1:29:58] didn't volunteer his own hand or arm or
[1:30:00] whatever
[1:30:02] yeah
[1:30:03] why because he had not one drop of faith
[1:30:05] take that little girl and cut her and
[1:30:08] then heal her
[1:30:09] and i'll believe that's a devil
[1:30:12] that is a devil saints
[1:30:15] that's uh oh the man was a pastor he was
[1:30:17] a religious leader he was a devil
[1:30:22] he's tempting god he's he's wanting and
[1:30:24] so strong in his spirit of deceit and
[1:30:28] and what to come and he's wanting to do
[1:30:30] it if he was such
[1:30:33] but you see he
[1:30:34] had such a spirit it's just like
[1:30:37] he'll cut that little kid and it cost me
[1:30:38] nothing
[1:30:41] cost me nothing because it's not real
[1:30:44] well i tell you what my brother and
[1:30:46] sister that man will never
[1:30:48] ever with that spirit ever receive
[1:30:51] one blessing
[1:30:53] from god
[1:30:55] not going to happen
[1:30:58] right
[1:30:59] the right
[1:31:00] mental attitude it's not the focus on
[1:31:02] mental right
[1:31:04] like being a what they call mind reader
[1:31:06] or you know
[1:31:08] mental telepathy mind over matter it's
[1:31:10] that's not what it's talking about but
[1:31:12] the right mental in other words get your
[1:31:14] mind in the right place that my god is a
[1:31:18] healer my god is a deliverer my god is a
[1:31:22] provider and when we can wrap that
[1:31:24] around it and say i don't care what
[1:31:26] happens i have an unshakable faith in
[1:31:28] god that he is my healer
[1:31:31] and it's in that case that god can come
[1:31:33] on the scene why because all the doors
[1:31:36] are open amen
[1:31:38] reminds me one time a friend shared this
[1:31:40] a little trouble in their church and the
[1:31:42] man said well i guess pastor if you want
[1:31:45] to you can come over to my house
[1:31:48] he really wanted to see this man and his
[1:31:49] family back in church and he goes to the
[1:31:51] house
[1:31:52] all their vehicles are in the driveway
[1:31:55] rings the doorbell no one answers
[1:31:58] takes a liberty walking through the gate
[1:32:00] and walking around back maybe they're on
[1:32:01] the back porch no one there
[1:32:04] goes back to the front
[1:32:07] rings the doorbell
[1:32:10] calls the man's phone that's where the
[1:32:12] man messed up
[1:32:14] calls the man's phone
[1:32:16] and the phone's close enough to the door
[1:32:18] he can hear it ring
[1:32:21] no answer
[1:32:23] goes to
[1:32:24] voicemail and he thought i know god sent
[1:32:27] me here
[1:32:29] imagine what this would be like
[1:32:31] god sent me here i know what the human
[1:32:33] effect would be disappointment
[1:32:35] he said come and now he shut me out
[1:32:38] and he's like i know god set me here
[1:32:47] my knuckles hurt
[1:32:52] finding the man coming to the door says
[1:32:54] can't you leave me alone
[1:32:55] and he said you invited me here i
[1:32:57] changed my mind
[1:32:59] god
[1:33:00] didn't
[1:33:04] man let him in
[1:33:05] ultimately they gave their hearts back
[1:33:07] to the lord amen you see because they
[1:33:09] had gave them to almost everything else
[1:33:11] on earth
[1:33:12] this brother
[1:33:13] sharing this he told me this this couple
[1:33:16] had just built
[1:33:17] a ginormous house
[1:33:20] this is all in a matter of three months
[1:33:22] built a ginormous house
[1:33:24] oh let me give you a backstory
[1:33:27] the man had been praying god bless me
[1:33:29] please lord help me help me lord
[1:33:31] god knew what kind of test this man
[1:33:33] needed god blessed him his business
[1:33:35] quadrupled in size went went from
[1:33:38] just two or three million a year to like
[1:33:40] 12 15 million a year he built a big
[1:33:42] monster house and he bought a brand new
[1:33:46] absolute decked out ford f-350 with
[1:33:48] everything on it and bought a boat that
[1:33:50] was almost too big for the pickup to
[1:33:52] pull and a camp trailer and razors and
[1:33:55] this and that and everything it was and
[1:33:58] all new furniture and whatever else and
[1:34:00] the whole time
[1:34:04] is that a blessing
[1:34:07] i'll tell you what a blessing is is when
[1:34:08] god comes in your house
[1:34:11] and when the devil wants to attack your
[1:34:12] baby
[1:34:13] the angel of the lord stands in the way
[1:34:15] amen when the wheels are ready to fall
[1:34:17] off your car and god keeps them on it
[1:34:20] those are real blessings it's not what
[1:34:23] this earth can provide it's what god has
[1:34:26] chosen to do for you and i and when our
[1:34:28] spirit would be low that he would lift
[1:34:30] us up and when our bodies would be weak
[1:34:32] he would give strength to us when our
[1:34:34] minds would be clouded he would come and
[1:34:37] say i'm here to keep you oh get this
[1:34:39] saint not put you back in your right
[1:34:42] mind but i'm here to keep you in your
[1:34:44] right mind you'll never have to fall in
[1:34:46] the beginning stand on the word stand
[1:34:49] with me and i'll keep you in the right
[1:34:51] mind i'll keep you in the right spirit
[1:34:54] i'll keep you in the right position
[1:34:57] but what happens is man wants to live
[1:34:59] like man wants to live and then ask god
[1:35:02] to come and fix it
[1:35:04] but you see god wants us to step into
[1:35:06] the judgment room
[1:35:08] and say lord am i balanced
[1:35:11] since i'm just now learning to do this
[1:35:13] i'm 60 years old i'm just now learning
[1:35:15] before i act upon this to step in and
[1:35:18] say lord am i balanced
[1:35:20] and sometimes even i hate to admit it my
[1:35:22] flesh still says
[1:35:26] i just gotta have this
[1:35:31] yeah
[1:35:33] come on
[1:35:35] still the flesh man
[1:35:43] but this fellow made a real rash thing
[1:35:45] we would think would think if i could
[1:35:46] only take his place i'd go up before the
[1:35:48] throne and take a message and the first
[1:35:50] thing i would do what would you do be
[1:35:52] interested in what your organization had
[1:35:55] sent you up there to find out about it
[1:36:00] or would you be looking around to see
[1:36:02] how heaven was decorated
[1:36:05] or in his presence with the first thing
[1:36:07] you say lord god forgive me a sinner
[1:36:10] that would be the right thing to do now
[1:36:12] as jesus watched the boy and as he went
[1:36:14] away might come in his mind why didn't
[1:36:16] that boy do that was because he wasn't
[1:36:19] conscious that's it get this saints
[1:36:22] not conscious of who he was we we talk
[1:36:25] about once again i'm around around this
[1:36:27] we talk about the lord jesus christ the
[1:36:29] holy ghost is present in the room
[1:36:33] and you know what i'm talking about we
[1:36:34] sense it we feel it it's here it's real
[1:36:39] but
[1:36:40] have we really
[1:36:42] come to be conscious
[1:36:44] of who he is
[1:36:47] and why he is here amen that's right and
[1:36:50] what he's desiring to do
[1:36:53] or did we pat ourselves on the back
[1:36:58] i went to church today
[1:37:01] and brother paul preached too long
[1:37:04] which is pretty normal
[1:37:06] but that's okay that is okay yeah
[1:37:11] you see what we've got to do saints
[1:37:15] because as i declare to you the real
[1:37:17] binding comes when we're subject to the
[1:37:19] word that's it that's exactly right
[1:37:21] people say you know brother so-and-so
[1:37:24] look i had a little brief conversation
[1:37:25] brother joel i forgot to tell you hello
[1:37:30] but you know his words were kind of
[1:37:31] twisted a little bit i think it was a
[1:37:32] bad connection on the phone
[1:37:34] because he didn't say anything about
[1:37:36] coming here and he says and when you
[1:37:37] come into my place
[1:37:39] and he had that backwards that was the
[1:37:41] words i was supposed to be saying
[1:37:44] but pray for brother jewel he's still
[1:37:45] just struggling physically he's lost a
[1:37:48] lot of weight but he's pretty weak
[1:37:51] but god's with him
[1:37:52] god's with him but i tell you saints
[1:37:55] i've been
[1:37:56] not lifting up brother jewel but i'm
[1:37:57] talking about when a man has surrendered
[1:37:59] to god i've been with brother jewell and
[1:38:01] he was there and he spoke things and
[1:38:04] people said that's exactly
[1:38:07] you know brother jewels got that mental
[1:38:09] thing
[1:38:12] yeah yeah you know that brother joe's
[1:38:15] got a real mental thing
[1:38:17] where he's able to just preach and speak
[1:38:19] right to their need
[1:38:22] you know what that mental thing is it's
[1:38:23] got the mind of christ
[1:38:26] it's not him he's not trying to figure
[1:38:28] it out he's not trying to get some voice
[1:38:31] he's just hearing it and what he hears
[1:38:33] he speaks and it's perfect because it's
[1:38:35] god amen
[1:38:37] amen
[1:38:40] why become conscience of who he is
[1:38:43] become conscious of his presence here
[1:38:45] amen amen i think there's now one more
[1:38:47] portion to this
[1:38:49] may i say this not sacrilegious may i
[1:38:51] say this not because it's this meeting
[1:38:54] or any meeting but i think that's a
[1:38:56] matter today people are not conscious of
[1:38:58] it they see the scripture exactly
[1:39:00] identified but they're not conscious of
[1:39:02] who it is they'll see something they'll
[1:39:04] say oh that was wonderful that was fine
[1:39:07] but you're not conscious of what it is
[1:39:09] if it was there would be a repentance
[1:39:11] going on a weeping a crying and the city
[1:39:14] would have such a revival till half of
[1:39:16] you would be locked up before morning
[1:39:18] that's right if we be conscious of what
[1:39:20] it is we'll pass by many times and miss
[1:39:22] the opportunity not being conscious
[1:39:27] serving god should be fun
[1:39:31] but
[1:39:32] fun
[1:39:33] has more than one definition
[1:39:36] some want fun
[1:39:37] to be the puppet show
[1:39:40] the camel the donkey
[1:39:42] they wanted to be the golf match
[1:39:45] between the ministry and
[1:39:48] the people
[1:39:50] they wanted to be the carnival
[1:39:52] with the apple bobbing and the
[1:39:54] baseball toss to dunk the preacher
[1:39:58] brian smith this is a true story
[1:40:01] can i give just a little bit of humor
[1:40:03] there was a church back east i believe
[1:40:05] it was massachusetts there was a man
[1:40:07] that was in that church it was very
[1:40:08] disgruntled
[1:40:10] and their church had a carnival
[1:40:12] and they had one of those deals and
[1:40:14] everybody starts kind of joking with the
[1:40:16] pastor hey pastor come on get up on here
[1:40:18] the pastor gets up there and this guy
[1:40:20] walks up is a dollar a throw this guy
[1:40:22] walks up there lays a hundred dollar
[1:40:24] bill on the counter
[1:40:29] what they didn't know is he played
[1:40:30] college baseball
[1:40:33] and the pastor sitting on the deal it's
[1:40:34] a little bit chilly that day
[1:40:36] they hand him the first ball
[1:40:40] ding splash
[1:40:43] pastor wow
[1:40:44] gets up
[1:40:46] ding splash ding splash ding splash ding
[1:40:52] splash ding splash a hundred times
[1:40:57] and then
[1:40:58] the pastor's like that's over and the
[1:41:00] guy reaches in pulls his wallet out
[1:41:03] and they're like that's not enough and
[1:41:04] he said i'm not through with you
[1:41:06] i've still got a little bit of animosity
[1:41:09] left
[1:41:12] line saints
[1:41:15] oh you all laugh but some of you know
[1:41:17] what i'm talking about

[1:41:21] sister we've got to come to the place
[1:41:24] that every little i wasn't talking about
[1:41:25] you having animosities to me i mean

[1:41:38] stuff to make the tomatoes grow you just

[1:41:46] god to move in our church

[1:41:49] come here and try and put the yolk back

[1:41:53] then take the pieces and throw them out
[1:41:55] of your life don't even leave them
[1:41:57] laying around where someone might try to
[1:41:59] put that yoke back on you
[1:42:02] oh hallelujah right what do we want to
[1:42:04] do the real binding comes when we get in
[1:42:06] the right position in christ that's when
[1:42:09] we can bind the devil
[1:42:11] amen people get discouraged well i bound
[1:42:13] the devil i bound the devil what's that
[1:42:15] music playing in your house

[1:42:29] the little things for the kids veggie
[1:42:31] tales and you know whatever these things
[1:42:33] they're they're not evil saints but when
[1:42:36] it's all that you do
[1:42:38] it becomes evil
[1:42:39] and it becomes evil because it's keeping
[1:42:41] your mind from having the mind of christ
[1:42:44] it's caught in this realm right here
[1:42:45] let's get out of the physical realm and
[1:42:47] get up into heavenly places amen god in
[1:42:50] the word never did show anything about
[1:42:52] using this garbage of this day to be our
[1:42:54] babysitter
[1:42:56] amen
[1:42:57] those things are used for education and
[1:42:59] there's not a problem it's the world we
[1:43:01] live in but the minute we turn it into a
[1:43:03] babysitter here child don't bother me
[1:43:06] watch this we have stepped over a
[1:43:08] boundary
[1:43:09] god help us
[1:43:10] god help us and we're all we're all
[1:43:12] subject amen i don't have little kids
[1:43:14] anymore but i'll tell you what there's
[1:43:16] been times when little decky's been
[1:43:18] jumping all over me and and just just

[1:43:35] mind is
[1:43:36] i just i love you i love you decky
[1:43:40] but go distract yourself
[1:43:44] and if we're not careful that spirit
[1:43:46] just comes in
[1:43:48] and the devil says oh
[1:43:50] you don't have time for that just go
[1:43:51] distract yourself
[1:43:54] are we okay saints just just another
[1:43:56] minute or two here
[1:43:58] amen
[1:43:59] hallelujah
[1:44:06] three or four
[1:44:11] i love that brother dwayne fair brought
[1:44:13] that he says you know can we
[1:44:15] and we have just five more minutes
[1:44:18] everybody raised their hands like okay 5
[1:44:20] 10 15 20
[1:44:22] 25 30 35 40. okay i got plenty of time
[1:44:28] hallelujah now look at this we're going
[1:44:30] to just make a reference here
[1:44:32] in matthew 7 it says judge not it be not
[1:44:36] judged for with what judgment you judge
[1:44:38] ye shall be judged and with what measure
[1:44:41] ye meet it shall be measured again
[1:44:43] and why behold this thou the mote that
[1:44:45] is in thy brother's eye but considers
[1:44:48] not the beam that is in the own eye or
[1:44:50] how will thou say to thy brother let me
[1:44:52] pull out the mote that is in thine eye
[1:44:54] and behold a beam is in thine own eye
[1:44:58] thou hypocrite
[1:45:00] that's it ouch
[1:45:02] thou hypocrite first cast out the beam
[1:45:05] out of thine own eye then shalt thou see
[1:45:09] clearly to cast the moat out of thy
[1:45:11] brother's eyes you see this what happens
[1:45:14] when we go and we judge ourselves right
[1:45:16] we get into the house of god we judge
[1:45:19] ourself and it's there that we can come
[1:45:22] and rightly divide the word of god and
[1:45:24] come and i'll tell you what it does say
[1:45:26] and said i'll just maybe this sounds bad
[1:45:28] forgive me but you know when i started
[1:45:30] applying or doing my best i've still got
[1:45:32] a ways to go i still got a ways to go
[1:45:34] but when i started doing that i found
[1:45:36] myself being a little judgmental now
[1:45:38] maybe i would pick on brother david
[1:45:40] brother jay or somebody here brother tim
[1:45:42] or whatever
[1:45:43] just as a reference but it'd be like
[1:45:44] well i sure didn't like what they did
[1:45:46] blah blah blah
[1:45:48] and then god speaks to you and says
[1:45:53] that's you
[1:45:55] you just don't see yourself
[1:45:58] what
[1:45:59] no that can't be i'm more spiritual than
[1:46:01] that lord
[1:46:03] i'm the pastor
[1:46:06] you see any exceptions in there
[1:46:09] i don't
[1:46:10] see and if you're the pastor
[1:46:16] no no exemptions
[1:46:18] god help us
[1:46:20] what happens
[1:46:21] true seed of god when you get that
[1:46:23] judgmental spirit god doesn't want you
[1:46:26] to not judge
[1:46:27] you know that that's exactly right god
[1:46:29] does not want you to say i can't judge
[1:46:31] that's what the world that's what
[1:46:33] denominational churches are doing
[1:46:34] they're teaching the people don't judge
[1:46:36] nobody don't judge nobody so nobody is
[1:46:38] doing nothing it's a free-for-all
[1:46:41] and they call it church and they call it
[1:46:42] the moving of the spirit they come to
[1:46:44] church and clothes they shouldn't even
[1:46:45] be in their own backyard in and they do
[1:46:48] that don't judge don't tell joe we're
[1:46:50] not supposed to judge no god wants you
[1:46:52] to judge that god wants you to judge
[1:46:54] from a clean heart because he said if
[1:46:57] you first cast the beam out of thine own
[1:47:00] eye and then when you see clearly
[1:47:04] not when you are subject to an opinion
[1:47:07] or an emotion or some other thing but
[1:47:09] when you see clearly is the time you can
[1:47:12] step in and say here brother sister let
[1:47:16] me help you
[1:47:17] because you know why when that beam is
[1:47:20] out of your own eye and you look in the
[1:47:22] mirror of god's word you will then be in
[1:47:24] the altar of your own soul crying out to
[1:47:27] god forgive me lord lord bring me to a
[1:47:30] place i can be a benefit to the body not
[1:47:33] a hindrance to the body bring me to a
[1:47:36] place i could be an example
[1:47:39] to my family
[1:47:41] hallelujah
[1:47:42] but see you've got to get to that
[1:47:44] position before the word's going to give
[1:47:45] you any authority
[1:47:48] hallelujah yeah
[1:47:51] us in the flesh trying to be the judge
[1:47:54] but you know this beautiful and i i
[1:47:56] don't know
[1:48:00] just one more quote saints
[1:48:02] do we have one more quote there brothers
[1:48:07] thank you
[1:48:10] question and answer somebody's asking
[1:48:13] it says just the elect goes at that time
[1:48:15] that lex takes the millennium then
[1:48:17] brother what type of people should we be
[1:48:19] i want to live through the millennium
[1:48:22] let us lay aside every wheat and sin
[1:48:24] that so easily beset us if the fellow
[1:48:26] says something wrong or does something
[1:48:29] or does something this way pray for him
[1:48:32] that's right
[1:48:34] that's the truth reminds me of a brother
[1:48:38] i'm not this is no thing for the
[1:48:40] preacher i just want to make this point
[1:48:43] i know a brother told me he says
[1:48:45] he preached his service
[1:48:46] in the church
[1:48:48] and he said the church revolt rejoiced
[1:48:50] they were breaking free from some things
[1:48:52] they had been bound in
[1:48:55] when that services was all over a sunday
[1:48:57] evening he's wrung out he's weak he's
[1:48:59] tired he's there and the man's like i've
[1:49:01] got a list right here of everything you
[1:49:03] said wrong
[1:49:07] and he says well you mind if i read it
[1:49:08] it says yeah i want you to read it
[1:49:11] and he started reading it now this
[1:49:14] brother is a little smarter than me
[1:49:16] he's like
[1:49:18] oh well just a second here
[1:49:20] he gets his books and notebooks and
[1:49:25] well
[1:49:27] here it is in the bible almost a
[1:49:30] mirror image of what i said here i
[1:49:33] left out a vowel or two
[1:49:36] the man's like well regardless
[1:49:38] keep reading
[1:49:40] and it goes down
[1:49:42] oh well this right here in church age
[1:49:44] book
[1:49:45] see
[1:49:47] keep reading
[1:49:49] goes through the whole list
[1:49:52] not because he was smart
[1:49:54] because the bible
[1:49:56] is infallible
[1:49:59] and when it got all done the man turned
[1:50:00] around just walked off never said i'm
[1:50:02] sorry
[1:50:04] never said forgive me
[1:50:06] nothing
[1:50:07] actually angry
[1:50:09] that his accusations
[1:50:11] proved to be false
[1:50:14] now my brother and sister with those
[1:50:16] kind of spirits
[1:50:17] it's no wonder churches
[1:50:20] get all locked up
[1:50:22] you know you guys ever done that you
[1:50:24] know bent over picked up something and
[1:50:26] you go to stand up and it's like
[1:50:30] imagine when a church gets that way
[1:50:32] the word trying to set them in order and
[1:50:34] lift them up in heavenly places and
[1:50:35] they're like
[1:50:37] you're not going to get me lifted up
[1:50:40] i'm just i'm just fine where i'm at
[1:50:46] well good this sounds rude but when the
[1:50:48] lord calls us home
[1:50:50] adios my friend
[1:50:52] because i'm not going to stay here
[1:50:54] because you won't move
[1:50:56] i'm going to keep moving because that's
[1:50:57] what god called me to do
[1:50:59] amen
[1:51:00] pray for him and keep
[1:51:02] moving on
[1:51:03] yeah look at that don't allow some
[1:51:06] spirit to come in the church and bind
[1:51:07] the whole church
[1:51:09] come on church and i probably shouldn't
[1:51:11] bring this up but we experienced this a
[1:51:13] couple years ago where the whole church
[1:51:15] was so bound up that everybody's walking
[1:51:18] out with a frown on their face and
[1:51:19] there's no joy left come on my brother
[1:51:21] and sister you pray for him but keep
[1:51:23] moving on
[1:51:25] let your one alternative be set towards
[1:51:27] god and if nobody else makes it you make
[1:51:30] it
[1:51:31] whoa almost sounds like a selfish spirit
[1:51:34] but i'm here to tell you god be my judge
[1:51:37] my heart i want to see every one of you
[1:51:39] make it but i also cry out to the lord
[1:51:42] lord i want to make it i've got to make
[1:51:45] it
[1:51:46] that's it this sister so often says i
[1:51:49] have come too far to quit now
[1:51:53] hallelujah
[1:51:54] oh
[1:51:56] if nobody else makes it you make it for
[1:51:58] there's going to be an elect who's going
[1:51:59] to live through the millennium age and
[1:52:01] will go in and out with christ for a
[1:52:03] thousand years then they shall go up
[1:52:05] into glory with him and return again
[1:52:08] when the resurrection of the wicked is
[1:52:09] brought forth then the millennium will
[1:52:11] set and after millennium is over then
[1:52:13] christ will go up with the church and at
[1:52:15] the end of a thousand years he will
[1:52:17] return with the church this is
[1:52:19] scriptural right
[1:52:21] amen
[1:52:22] christ comes three times first time he
[1:52:24] came to redeem his church is that right
[1:52:26] second time he comes to receive his
[1:52:28] church third times he comes with his
[1:52:31] church see he come to redeemer he come
[1:52:33] to rapture her be caught away in the
[1:52:35] time of the plagues and so forth returns
[1:52:37] back from the millennium lives through
[1:52:39] the millennium and then the great king
[1:52:41] and queen
[1:52:49] the great king
[1:52:51] and you realize now i have very poor
[1:52:53] grasp of english those of you really
[1:52:55] smart forgive me
[1:52:57] but the way i learned english was is if
[1:53:00] the context of the sentence is written
[1:53:02] correctly
[1:53:03] and the then the great
[1:53:06] king
[1:53:07] and because of the way it is written you
[1:53:10] could actually block out king and the
[1:53:12] word and
[1:53:14] and declare it it's the great queen also
[1:53:17] because it is oh i won't even say it
[1:53:20] because you guys will laugh at me but it
[1:53:22] is the connection that connects them
[1:53:24] together just as the blood of jesus
[1:53:27] christ a new birth the holy ghost has
[1:53:31] bound us to christ it is not some kind
[1:53:34] of slippery spray with wd-40 and it
[1:53:37] might go away no sir the blood of jesus
[1:53:40] christ and his spirit in you and i has
[1:53:43] bound us together with him and what he
[1:53:46] is we are
[1:53:48] hallelujah his spirit his nature his
[1:53:52] life is now our spirit our nature and
[1:53:56] our life we are not the rift of one
[1:53:59] portion of that
[1:54:01] anybody that preaches that that you're
[1:54:03] this and he is that we'll never be the
[1:54:05] savior we'll never be the creator we'll
[1:54:08] never be the deliverer but we are in him
[1:54:12] and therefore the attributes of that are
[1:54:14] in us because all that i am i have
[1:54:17] poured into the church and all is in the
[1:54:19] church i poured into you he didn't say i
[1:54:22] poured a residue i poured a leftover i
[1:54:26] poured a portion he said all that was in
[1:54:29] there been poured into you
[1:54:31] oh hallelujah
[1:54:34] and so the great king and queen comes
[1:54:36] down for the judgment
[1:54:38] the white throne judgment is set and the
[1:54:39] books were opened and there stands a
[1:54:41] redeemed holy ghost-born church of the
[1:54:44] living god standing there in her beauty
[1:54:50] how could we be that
[1:54:52] because you get in the word of god you
[1:54:55] become the living word you are born in
[1:54:58] christ and therefore you come into the
[1:55:00] nature and the mind of christ put you in
[1:55:04] a position and i'm telling you this is
[1:55:06] not something for another day this is
[1:55:09] something god is preparing you and i for
[1:55:11] this day right now amen that we could
[1:55:14] judge and judge correctly not from what
[1:55:17] we saw not what our education said not
[1:55:20] what our emotions are or how weary our
[1:55:23] spirit is but it's by the word that we
[1:55:26] would judge all things it's by the
[1:55:28] nature of christ the life of christ is
[1:55:31] how we would judge this
[1:55:33] and because the judgment is not set at
[1:55:36] this moment then we should be giving
[1:55:38] grace to every man woman boy and girl
[1:55:42] and giving prayers and lifting them up
[1:55:45] lord save them lord deliver them lord
[1:55:48] come pour a portion out on them lord by
[1:55:51] according to your perfect will
[1:55:53] and when the will of god is done my
[1:55:55] brother and sister there is no nothing
[1:55:57] left
[1:55:59] when the will of god is done there is
[1:56:00] nothing left there is no i think it
[1:56:03] should have
[1:56:04] amen
[1:56:06] it's settled
[1:56:08] it's settled
[1:56:09] this is sure
[1:56:11] is it settled in our souls
[1:56:13] right now
[1:56:15] when god is finished
[1:56:16] it will be settled amen amen and we will
[1:56:19] not be saying but that was my friend
[1:56:21] that was my neighbor that was my cousin
[1:56:23] an uncle of what
[1:56:25] or bring it right down
[1:56:26] home you see that bride sitting there in
[1:56:29] judgment it's not going to say
[1:56:31] now lord
[1:56:32] i was so close to my cousin
[1:56:35] i know they never served you and never
[1:56:36] even tried but lord you you should save
[1:56:38] them
[1:56:40] no you see at that moment in time it's
[1:56:42] set
[1:56:43] amen and did you know your judgment
[1:56:46] right now
[1:56:48] is actually set right now
[1:56:52] because it's right here that's it that's
[1:56:54] exactly there's no other judgment to
[1:56:56] come that's it
[1:56:57] nothing of our creeds
[1:56:59] nothing of our man-made traditions or
[1:57:01] doctrines
[1:57:02] it's said
[1:57:03] amen
[1:57:04] saints
[1:57:06] step into
[1:57:07] judgment today
[1:57:10] find a mirror of god's word step into
[1:57:12] judgment
[1:57:13] and say lord amen
[1:57:15] correct me by your word
[1:57:18] don't need some big man
[1:57:20] mean man
[1:57:21] reminds me of my childhood i think
[1:57:24] sister sue would remember this
[1:57:27] my sister would remember this a man
[1:57:28] named ronald sims
[1:57:30] i was as big as a barn
[1:57:32] he was so big he used to take
[1:57:34] transmissions he was a transmission
[1:57:35] repairman he didn't use a transmission
[1:57:38] jack
[1:57:39] he crawled underneath the car and did
[1:57:41] everything grabbed that transmission
[1:57:42] lifted out there and went and set it on
[1:57:44] a bench
[1:57:45] had hands like dinner plates
[1:57:50] it was a kind of a paradox because on
[1:57:52] one side ronald was just
[1:57:54] real soft
[1:57:57] real humble man
[1:57:59] but because of other
[1:58:02] other influences i would say
[1:58:07] had an attitude as a deacon
[1:58:10] you misbehave
[1:58:13] i'll grab you by the hair of your head
[1:58:15] i'll drag you out of here and take you
[1:58:17] out in the back room and i'll beat you
[1:58:20] well if you're not saved
[1:58:23] that's just simply terrifying
[1:58:26] you know
[1:58:27] wouldn't it caleb somebody come and
[1:58:30] threaten to just drag you down in the
[1:58:31] basement and just
[1:58:33] brother ivan would be our good example
[1:58:36] imagine
[1:58:38] imagine i think caleb would i don't
[1:58:40] think we'd ever see you ever misbehave
[1:58:42] would we not even blink in church if the
[1:58:44] idea that you're going to be drug in the
[1:58:46] basement we'd hear the noise ah
[1:58:48] caleb i'll stop stop no not till you
[1:58:52] repent
[1:58:55] but if you're saved
[1:58:58] you realize how wrong
[1:59:00] that kind of behavior is
[1:59:03] because a holy ghost
[1:59:06] is a quiet humble spirit
[1:59:08] a gentleman
[1:59:10] and it comes
[1:59:12] and we judge caleb i'm using you for
[1:59:15] example buddy are you good for the ride
[1:59:18] okay
[1:59:20] we want caleb to not cut up in church
[1:59:22] and
[1:59:23] not be doing all these bad things we
[1:59:25] don't drag him in the basement and beat
[1:59:27] him
[1:59:28] we ourselves go in the basement
[1:59:31] and cry out to god amen
[1:59:33] save this young man change his life amen
[1:59:36] there's where the difference goes amen
[1:59:39] why because when we went down in the
[1:59:41] basement and started crying out to god
[1:59:43] if
[1:59:44] we're real christian yes sir we started
[1:59:46] where first
[1:59:48] lord forgive me
[1:59:50] of my own faults
[1:59:51] and my own failures
[1:59:53] lord i want to be able to be held up
[1:59:55] against the light of the word
[1:59:57] then there'll be a bunch of smudges
[2:00:00] not be a bunch of dirt on my garment
[2:00:03] help me lord amen
[2:00:05] that saints
[2:00:07] is when you see god change
[2:00:10] people in a church
[2:00:12] when everyone in the church is willing
[2:00:15] to stand
[2:00:16] in the judgment that's it
[2:00:18] of god's word
[2:00:20] then you'll see a church that the holy
[2:00:22] spirit comes in
[2:00:23] moves freely amen
[2:00:25] comes up and down the aisles and young
[2:00:27] lives are changed
[2:00:29] we don't have all these kids i'm telling
[2:00:31] you it happens i pray it never happens
[2:00:34] here
[2:00:35] god's will be done but i pray it never
[2:00:37] happens here when you see churches i was
[2:00:39] talking to brother recently
[2:00:41] 58 percent he'd had it figured out of
[2:00:44] their young people had blitzed out of
[2:00:45] their church
[2:00:47] 58 over half
[2:00:50] gone
[2:00:51] i said what went
[2:00:52] wrong he said paul what went wrong
[2:00:56] is our pastor
[2:00:58] beats
[2:00:59] the children
[2:01:02] i should invite caleb up here so i could
[2:01:04] demonstrate that
[2:01:08] is that the right way
[2:01:10] y'all going to be closer to the lord if
[2:01:12] the pastor beats you
[2:01:14] no sir
[2:01:16] let's judge
[2:01:18] let's judge so that we won't be judged
[2:01:21] let's judge ourselves by the word
[2:01:24] and let the holy ghost come down
[2:01:26] move in our midst change our lives
[2:01:29] can someone lift a hand and say lord
[2:01:31] that's what i want
[2:01:32] that's the kind of church i want to be
[2:01:34] in that's kind of life i want to live i
[2:01:36] want you to come down lord i want you to
[2:01:38] be the one that changes my life
[2:01:42] hallelujah because you know there's
[2:01:44] conforming
[2:01:47] i always like to use this example when
[2:01:48] it comes to conforming
[2:01:51] that's when we put you in a giant
[2:01:52] machine and smash you into the shape we
[2:01:54] want you to be
[2:01:56] but then at work
[2:01:58] then at work
[2:02:00] but when we come ourselves and conform
[2:02:03] ourself to the word of god by god's
[2:02:05] grace
[2:02:06] then
[2:02:07] we have a life-changing moment
[2:02:10] hallelujah let this day be our judgment
[2:02:13] day saints that each one of us if we
[2:02:16] have things we need to do i'll tell you
[2:02:18] brother jay
[2:02:19] my heart just shook
[2:02:20] when you said
[2:02:22] let's not let
[2:02:23] our i'll remember the exact words let's
[2:02:25] not let our sins and our little things
[2:02:27] hinder a healing amen
[2:02:30] let's not let those little things saints
[2:02:32] that we refuse to get out of our life
[2:02:33] and get out of our church hinder a
[2:02:35] healing hinder salvation hinder the
[2:02:39] baptism of the holy ghost
[2:02:42] because i tell you
[2:02:43] god won't won't fill himself won't pour
[2:02:45] himself in dirty vessels

[2:02:48] challenges
