Liberty and the word amen to know that what God is doing for us my brother and sister he is not an impersonal God Amen he he is a very personal God Amen just got a couple things here was shared with me for us to pray for sister nah she will be traveling back to Dess later today I'm sure that's a difficult time for her to um go back leave her grandchild and and that so let's just bow our heads for a moment and just lift our voices in prayer for our sister Nina uh you know that part of the world is is a world filled with chaos and uh violence and uh so we just want the Lord to be with her give her traveling mercies Heavenly Father Lord Lord we lift our sister nah up today Lord You've blessed her Lord beyond measure father something that man would say could not be done and father you granted that for her to have this ability to come and go and father we would ask you Lord that she would be able to hold the memories of this time and with her family her children and her grandchild father Lord let those be Precious Memories but father let her light that light shine so strongly father when she gets back amongst the Saints there in denque father that Lord it would be just a beautiful time a a beautiful experience father and Lord to know that you've called us to be victorious no matter where we're at or what our circumstance is so father we ask you to Grant to our sister nah traveling mercies today Lord and bless her in all things we pray in the name of Jesus Christ amen Hallelujah truly Saints you know when the government decided in that circumstance to allow our sister nah to uh be able to come back that was a miracle amen amen because our government just takes a stance once you forsake that it's finished and yet God come and just granted that so I think that's wonderful amen um brother Ben God bless you I really can't say I know brother Ben I I met him in Belgium but I was so preoccupied with uh other situations that were there so I snubbed him ignored him just went past him all all the things that I shouldn't have done I've been told before public apologies are not really apologies so uh I I would like to break that rule and please accept my apology brother Ben uh I just remember this will embarrass Gabriella but that's all right I love embar bassing her I just remember walking out of the dining hall and sister Gabriel is like brother Paul brother Paul want you to and I was like hi I got things I got to do and I walked off they might not remember it quite that way but anyway God bless you brother Ben and uh brother Ben is Sister Gabriel's friend uh so anyway uh sorry about that Gabriel you know uh anyway welcome brother Ben God bless you um Sunday school and young adults will start uh September the 15th um that's Sunday uh so I'm sorry I've been a little bit dilatory but it just seemed like every time I wanted to start things it was a circumstance and I shouldn't have let the circumstance keep me uh you you can be that's fine thank you uh and so September 15th young adults and Sunday school will start amen let's not forget that this uh coming Wednesday uh and uh following Sunday brother Craig Boer will be preaching for us and uh brother Craig's family is here to uh spend a little little time as a family um little relaxation a little fellowship and um so next Sunday there will be a fellowship following the service so let's remember that um sisters coordinate that if you would please uh and um let's just be in prayer for brother Craig he'll be finishing up ministering in North Idaho and then they'll drive down to see us so uh just uh be praying for that amen amen good to be in the house of the Lord today amen amen God is good let's turn in our Bibles I want to talk to you once again uh kind of a continuation of last Sunday uh a personal message and um you know God deals with church ages he deals with churches but his real focus is to deal with us as individuals uh even the message of the hour uh is spoken in this day uh uh God give a real Focus that it was about the individual there will not be a church relationship that gets us in it will not be a message relationship that gets us in but it will be a personal relationship that um gets us into the Rapture into the presence of the Lord let's turn in Ephesians the fth chapter uh starting with the eth verse uh lay a little foundation in just actually the last uh two or three verses there for ye were sometimes Darkness but now are ye light in the Lord walk as children of light and I think all of us can say Amen to that verse there's been times that we we uh didn't walk really in the present Truth uh and um yet God has given us a wonderful opportunity to be children of light amen for the fruit of the spirit is in all goodness and righteousness and Truth proving what is acceptable unto the Lord and I want to just CU we're not going to preach on this but I want to just just uh uh make a little emphasis on verse vers 10 there God is proving in our lives what is acceptable unto him now when we come short of what is acceptable to him God does not say well I guess you failed the test and you're finished but he takes us back through and it's amazing my brother and sister because we would be embarrassed you might say uh sometimes of of things that happen in our life and we'd say you know I thought I was beyond that I thought that that would be no longer an issue in my life but you see God has a way of going back into our circumstance and actually allowing us to come short in the test amen it's actually in his will amen that we come short because in that time uh if we would use the word failure I don't really like to use that word but if we use that word failure it's a time of our failure that it exposes not to the devil not to everyone else in the church but it exposes to us yes our shortcoming that we need to work on that we need to submit to the Lord and so when God works through failure my brother and sister we know it wasn't us that overcome it was him Christ in US amen and have no fellowship with unfruitful works of darkness but rather reprove them for it is a shame even to speak of those things which are done of them in secret but all things that are reproved are made manifest by the light for whatsoever doth maketh manifest is light wherefore he saith awake thou that sleepest Lord help us to be awake and arise from the dead and Christ shall give thee light see then that you walk circumspectly not as fools but as wise and I thought this is interesting brother Trevor you just mentioned that right there when you were here in the Pulpit Redeeming the time because the days are evil wherefore be not unwise but understanding what the will of the Lord is Heavenly Father we ask you to bless the time lord the word today May it touch each and every heart father Lord we we just want we long father to come closer to you Lord as the song says J a closer walk with thee Lord that is our desire that is our plea father and we ask you to come speak to each and every heart Lord bless our visitors today Father Lord and those on the internet Lord would just uh pray father that that Lord you know every circumstance and you know every need that we have to hear the word not to hear a man but to hear your word father so let your word come forth pure righteous and holy for its full benefit to the body of Believers in the name of Jesus Christ amen you may be seated amen you know as we look at this I I've said this quite a few times through the years that um I'm not so sure that the present day Church could handle Paul he he was so direct he he was so blunt that certainly in the spirit of the age now we're we're you know we we so much don't want to desire anyone that uh you know the prophet of God said it would come a time that that they would I'm paraphrasing it that they would have the word so watered down that it would be of none effect and uh I think I think we've reached that time I think we've come into this season where where uh the world is is speaking the gospel they quote the scripture they quote The Messengers of days gone by and yet it is so watered down that that it is um of none effect but Paul is speaking here to the Ephesians and he's speaking pretty straightforward and you know when when God speaks to his bride through his Messengers uh it's the same as being lip to ear of God speaking to you and I amen if if it's the word we're not talking about personality of man we're not talking about man's ideas but when it is the word of God coming forth that is the same as God being right beside you and his lips by your ears speaking to you the word for the hour amen that's why my brother and sister the Prophet come and and he approached things in such a fashion that he while speaking boldly never made emphasis that it was about him he made emphasis that this is the word from God for you for this day and so when God speaks through to his bride through his Messengers as I said it's a same as lip to ear and I believe it's the same in this day my brother and sister you take the message of the hour you take what God has given us and when we will ponder this study it read it pray about it you'll find that it's actually God right here beside you whispering in your ear amen it is not a man's idea not a man's message because we can look at history and we can see that if it was a man message it would have denominated by now it would have failed by now and become just a book of ideas and doctrines and rules but this my brother and sister I I don't know I can only speak from my experience but this is so relevant that you can literally come and find yourself in a situation and reach out to the Lord and realize the an is right there in your hand and it was this season that God said it's time for you to see a little bit more it's time for you to grow a little bit more amen uh and so in that we we'll see how God is working he is opening his word and we talk about the road to emus my brother and sister and how that they were walking they were discouraged anybody ever get discouraged amen and they were walking discouraged and the word came to them and as they were there the word was being placed in their hearts amen they were listening to the things that were spoke now when we read those verses did Jesus said now you poor mistreated little guys no you fools and slow of heart could we believe my brother and sister that God would speak to that call us fools and and slow of heart to believe the word but yet when it come down to the time that they broke bread amen their eyes were open the Revelation that the word was in their midst come alive we are here this morning and the bread has been broken amen we're here and it's been open to us to become real not something we talk about what happened in the past but a real word present tense with us today amen and so as you look at this uh uh God is speaking now amen and the word has spoken and so we can therefore declare God has spoken amen now sometimes we get the ideas you know people get this where they get discouraged life is tough and and they feel like the word being preached is always just uh uh you know straighten up straighten up correct this you're doing this wrong but my brother and sister the word is not all correction it it it is not all just a line up tow the mark amen but I just want to ask you you know you don't have to lift a hand if you don't but who needs correction amen I know that I need correction there's times that I'm walking as a blindfolded man and you know you think oh I wouldn't run off the road I I wouldn't get detoured and distracted but then we do and we don't even realize and that shows just how deceptive the spirit of the age is is when we can start to get lukewarm and cold and not even realize it but God says I love you too much to let you get lukewarm I let love you too much to let you get cold I love you too much to let you drift off the road of life it's straight and it's narrow and I'm going to keep you centered on that road and yet if we're not careful we'll go man the preaching of the word is is so hard so hard on me let's make it more personal amen so hard on me but do you realize that God has come because he knows just exactly what the pull of the world is now when we're talking amongst Believers we talk about the pull of the world we're not talking about cigarettes and alcohol and dance halls my brother and sister we're talking about the lukewarm Spirit of leoda we've got truth can we say Amen to that and we believe that all is well because we possess the truth TR but sometimes my brother and sister the truth is stale amen still truth but stale because we're looking back to another day that's right that's right you follow me that's right amen so it's not all correction but we need it amen it's not all just about promises the the song service there you know singing about some promises it's just not just about promises my brother and sister but we need to see the promises amen so it's not a carrot on a stick often times that's what promises are are viewed at as a something to uh cause you to take another step because you're trying to attain to it you're trying to get the no it it's not but we do need those promises because those promises are God's promises amen amen that is not a church promise it's not a man promise amen it's not a denomination promise it's a god promise amen and so we need to see the promise we need to be able to see tangibly that's what happened to Israel in the wilderness they got out there and somehow or another and the preoccupation of traveling in a dry Dusty land remembering that working in the the Brick Factory in Egypt wasn't all that bad you talk about a deceptive spirit in the day we live in when people are delivered from drugs and alcohol and all of the things that pertain to the world and 25 30 40 years later tempted to go back my brother and sister Satan has come and he's beautified I want you to think about that he's beautified the circumstance what we once I just reading this morning the prophet said you know where we once cried out all night we once cried out to God for deliverance now we just accept it my brother and sister that's not what we were called to do but we need to see the Promise and who likes blessings amen amen I love blessings amen but it's not just about being blessed my brother and sister it's not just about oh God's pouring out blessing the church we have more Cadillacs and Mercedes and this that and the other in the parking lot than any other church we have a finder my brother and sister none of that means one thing to your soul that's right you can drive an old beat up you know it used to be when I was a kid uh there was certain imported cars and I won't say where they were from but uh uh for the sake of some Believers here but anyway uh but but you know that was a joke if you were talking about a car that would be driving down the road and the fender would just fall off that's what you called it and so you know that was the insult of all insults when it come to cars and you look at that you know and and uh we're like praise God we've never had to drive something like that and praise God we've been blessed beyond measure praise God my brother and sister I'll tell you what the prophet of God told us we'd be better off eating soda crackers and drinking Branch water and be in the will of God than to be blessed in the tangible worldly things and be without Christ amen our souls in a spiritual drought now drought means different things to different people my brother and sister but when a drought comes nothing's blessed amen so it's there you know this will be something maybe that um you would um kind of question me making a statement sometimes we need to stir our intellectuals amen now if that sounds odd ball I have the quote to back it up amen prophet of God talking about stirring the intellectuals what he's doing God's coming in stirring our minds it's scriptural in more than one way because he said to stir up your pure Minds in remembrance amen stirring up your intellectuals but yet this message is not an intellectual message amen it is to some they grasp it that that we can take a a chart or a board and put everything in exactly the right place but if that doesn't live you don't have much right you've got a diagram you've you've got a a um oh what's the word uh anyway you understand a chart you've got it all laid out this is going to be this is this goes that that's good my brother and sister but there's got to be life those lines connecting all that got to be life amen it's got to be something that touches your heart and brings you back in line and you know what we sometimes you know I'm thinking the church we need to get a few visiting ministers that will come in here and and shake the church hard enough to pull the SC screws out the floor on the pews Amen to shake it because sometimes we need a shaking sometimes we get complacent we can say Amen well the prophet said a Believer would say Amen to every word of God but I want to know is there something deep down inside that amen that is almost demanding I want more of that or do we simply acknowledge that we agree by saying amen have we come to the place that desperation is a word that's not spoken in our church it's not spoken in our lives we're message Believers we've got truth We're The Chosen well my brother and sister we're The Chosen and the proof is in the pudding that's right that's right because I don't care if you have all the right ingredients doesn't mean your pudding is going to turn out right amen now I I I I've been breaking this pretty good but you know Sister Jerry you'll cook something a dessert a meal and it will be just so scrumptious and I would say hey I would like that again this next week I can tell I've got to know her really well she gets kind of this awkward little and she said I don't know I just dropped a dab of this and a shake of that and I thought what would this be like if I added basil what's basil well it's what made that taste good but a little too much or not enough never be recreated what was a book of Acts the day of Pentecost what was it doing my brother and sister it was planting the seed of a word and a life that can be replicated again and again and again and again Through the Ages amen everything that they have we have now our need is to get it in the right proportion we can stack the message up I've been collecting message books from people that either quit or thought because we live in in a digital age they didn't need their books anymore I I collect them up you want to give any of your books away just call me amen I don't care if I have 25 of the same message book I'll take yours amen because that's how important this is to me and yesterday I was putting away I was putting away a a bunch of message books that I had once again collected up and I was putting them away in my bookcase and you know my brother and sister as I was putting that away I got complet complely distracted because I was pulling it out waiting to put this certain book in a certain place and I thought oh I haven't read that message for a while you know after a bit I'm like wait just a second I'm supposed to be cleaning up this room not not you know sitting down but I'm telling you if the desire to be in the word is not greater than our desire even for a clean office amen if it's not greater than for a a benefit of this or a benefit of that if our desire for that word is not great than anything around us then we have a clutter much worse than something stacked on top of a desk amen we got a clutter in the soul amen and I tell you sometimes God just needs to shake us I I don't know maybe I'll just step out our limb how many of you would like to have some Ministry come to this church that would shake it amen that would come and and just just remind us that the devil is a Sly old Fox amen would remind us that we have to be diligent day in and day out now remind us that we're living in a time that Satan produces everything he can produce that will distract you he's got books he's got movies he's got this he's got that just go down the list and name it and it's all there as a distraction right it might not turn you from serving God but it will turn you from serving God like we should that's right amen a distraction amen I tell you but wow we need the word to be uh uh to Shake us yeah we also need a tender Embrace amen amen how how many of you love that when the Lord comes midnight hour early morning when the sun's Rising whatever that is and you just feel that tender Embrace of our Lord Jesus speaking to your heart and sometimes in that tender Embrace there's correction sometimes in that tender embrace my brother and sister there's Revelation but we need that tender Embrace God is not a God that's just a god of judgment God loves us amen and he's proved how much he loves us by what he has done for us amen and so that tender Embrace in Isaiah 40 amen we'll look right here Isaiah 40 the voice said cry and he said what shall I cry all flesh is grass all the goodliness thereof is as a flower of the field the grass withereth and the flower fadeth because the spirit of the Lord bloweth upon it surely the people is grass the grass wherewith the flower fadeth but the word of our God shall stand forever oh Zion what bringeth good tidings get thee up into the high mountain oh Jerusalem what bringeth good tidings lift up thy voice with strength amen amen you want good tidings lift up your voice with strength we're not here to whimper and to cry and be Beggars we're here to stand on the promised word that God has given us my brother and sister and from the day that Esther walked into the the palace and walked up and heard those words amen that even to the half do you realize from that day on Esther who had the right nature the right Spirit the right character amen she didn't become suddenly a bossy woman but she knew then she had authority to speak and it was her husband backing her up amen come on are we the bride of Jesus Christ or not amen are we just a bunch of churchgoers that heard a message and agreed with it no we're the Esther of our age we're the Esther the Bride of this day that has heard the word that says to the half of my kingdom and then we know we can come not as bossy women but come as the Bride of Jesus Christ with the authority of the bridegroom behind us oh how beautiful amen oh Zion bring us thou Good Tidings get thee up to the high mountain oh Jerusalem that bringeth good tidings lift up thy voice with strength lift it up Be not Afraid say unto the cities of Judah Behold our God behold the Lord God will come with strong hand his arm shall rule for him behold his rewards is with him and his work before him he shall feed his flock like a shepherd He Shall Gather the Lambs with his arm and carry them in his bosom and shall gently lead those that are with young oh my brother and sister I say today we need to break the apathy of leoda and long and desire and cry out to be in the bosom of our Lord Jesus Christ no longer we're checking off that that we're in church we we went to church oh you know we had more important things well my brother and sister that's fine I'm not faulting for that I'm coming in a harvest season here I pray God opens a door that I can be in every service whether I'm ministering or not but sometimes the things of life might hinder you from being in church but that doesn't stop you from being in the presence of God wrapped in his bosom amen with his strong arms around you pulling you in his presence amen that's what we long if we can sit in church we can be here and not be in his Embrace that's right we canot be in his will and be in the house of God what we want to do is be in his bosom and in his will in his presence living his life through US amen hallelujah we must be balanced people when I think of balance anymore here a couple years ago or however long it was I was in the farm shop there and I was talking to the help they were all circled around and they all thought I was playing games but suddenly the world started spinning and it spun faster and faster until I fell face forward on the concrete that hurt but I'm laying there on the ground now I can't so to speak fall any further down and my head didn't stop spinning I tried to lift my head I thought I was looking straight ahead and they said I was sitting there with my head turned this way CU that's what I fought balance is very important we're not going to go into a lecture about the inner ear and all those little balls that are rattling around inside there uh we're not going to go into the whole thing how the inner ear and outer ear and how they're all connected I've heard the doctor say that again and again yada yada yada but you see there's something that's got to be connected from the inner right to the outer for us to have balance if there's no connection there we'll think we're walking correctly we'll think we're looking okay but completely out of balance amen Christ on the inside my brother and sister must connect with the man as it were on the outside that's figurative figure of speech we're not trying to derive a perfect spiritual scenario there but what's on the inside must be connected there must be something that reflects back to you and I in other words my brother and sister the prophet of God talks about a man having a temper and the man being a faithful member of the church I believe a deacon or something like that and and you know but there was not there was something not quite connected there and and the man had a temp and claimed to have the Holy Ghost something on the inside was not connected to something on the outside I say God help us to have that connection like we need to have so that we can come and and he's promised to feed his flock Like a Shepherd amen you think our Lord's a sloppy Shepherd no no my brother and sister he's the finest Shepherd That Ever Walked amen caring more amen knowing exactly what we need what pasture we need to eat from and when we should go to the water amen all of these things and he'll feed his flock Like a Shepherd and he'll gather his Lambs now I don't know you know uh you might think I'm too old to call myself a lamb but when it comes to serving God I'm just a tender little lamb amen and it's there you know I I just really I just really Saints want us to catch a revelation of what it is to be drawn into his Embrace in the time of trouble amen when the fiery darts are flying when the is in your face when the enemy is trying to convince you you're not even a believer because of something you've said or done well you know guys I'm pretty personal do you know what I'm talking about yes sir Amen in those times we need to know God still got his arms wrapped around me dealing with an individual just here somewhat recent saying you know what brother Paul I've just done too much for God to to love me to carry on and I said really really more than balum no I'm not a balum more than Judas no I'm not a Judas then what are you talking about that's Satan talking to you you've done too much you can't H you're not over going to overcome this ever no my brother and sister the word is here amen Christ has got us wrapped in his Embrace Satan wants us to ask the Lord to drop us let me tell you right now he's never dropped a lamb Hallelujah I hope you don't mind a little humor but when we first had our first child sister jool and they're not here today not feeling well forgot to put them in the prayer requests I carried jool Lynn around on a pretty good size had my favorite pillow for carrying my daughter around I place her plunk in this pillow and then I pick the whole thing up oh that people would be like oh that's so nice you know make her comfortable no I was afraid of dropping her amen I would walk around like H what would I ever tell Jerry in the world you know show up at church and my little baby girl's got a black eye a no problem I just dropped her it happens but God's never dropped a one amen he's not going to show you display you as the bride of Christ with a big black eye and a laceration on your head oh sorry I dropped you my brother and sister never dropped a single lamb he holds them in his brace and that is their Fortress is in his Embrace amen amen now I tell you what that don't get any more personal right that's why we as message Believers don't believe in all this this cuddly stuff like the world does you you go to churches you go to places and visit and and you know everybody's going around and hugging everybody and and you don't know who husband whose wife who's what who's that cuz it's all just this big hucky thing but my brother and sister God didn't want our Embrace to be carnal he wants our Embrace to be spiritual amen and that ties right down to husband and wife amen that those relationships are very very important to God they're they're not just casual God doesn't want casual marriage in the church he doesn't want casual relationship in the church he wants it to be intense he wants it to be powerful he wants it to be focused amen come on are you with me amen God wants that my brother and sister not a casual thing but you see we got to be balanced CU if we're not balanced we can't even trust God H do you realize your trust in the Lord Jesus Christ is directly connected to your spiritual balance that's why the song I want more of Jesus really should have a deeper meaning than I think we mostly give it that's right because the more we have of him the better our balance is have you ever found yourself judgmental can I go ahead and just lift my hand for all of us you know why we're judgmental because we ourselves don't have balance of the situation you see somebody fail no they failed but because you have failed and found restoration should give you more balance for those who have fallen that's right amen not less right you've heard the old phrase they threw the book at them yeah I want to ask you this morning what would happen if we had this book thrown at us give guilty is the only thing I can say but who has been given much grace amen may we give much grace hallelujah amen now let's go on Amen Satan's Eden now I like this brother brandom is actually coming he's dealing with us in such a fashion uh here and and if you go and I you know I always encourage you go back look at these things in the full context but we find you know the prophet of God is saying you know what I I wanted to speak to you something to bring something to Enlighten you to Enlighten to you the promise of God for this age amen see we got to be careful that we just don't gloss over the promises yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah the prophet wanted the people I I I hope you don't mind me putting it this way he wanted the people to catch a revelation of the promise to them amen not that just God made a promise right amen I was just reading the prophet of God put it this way he said you need to have uh deeper understanding than just I'm Healed how many of us have been prayed for or been sick and said I'm Healed but you see you have to have a deeper understanding that when you said by his stripes I'm Healed that you literally stepped into that promise and said amen it's finished now that's right I'm healed amen but you know what happens now I'm going to speak from Paul's okay is that okay I think I'm as normal as you guys are and um you know what we do we we come to church and we say praise God I'm Healed we're out in the foyer somebody says how you guys doing well my head hurts my shoulder hurts my back hurts my my wallet hurts my now I don't say that drug Tory I've done it just as many times as you have but the prophet's trying to get us to understand that when we claim our healing it has to be a revelation that you would be able to say oh do I have some pain in my body yes but praise God I was healed amen amen now I know that's hard but I can tell you for the last week and a half I've had tremendous pain in my body and I've been testing Ed with this very test hang on to your Pew I failed because I blamed every single thing that malfunctioned in the last couple weeks on this hip instead of telling this hip to shut up amen amen I sympathized with it now you guys know what I'm talking about right it's a human thing but you see I I think and I don't want to go too far on this because I want to preach about it later but I think we need a change in our thinking yeah we need to come to a place we do not need more Revelation from the word we need more Revelation in US amen we need to be able to say you know what I've heard the word I know the word is true am I lining up with this word and I think unfortunately this might sound harsh unfortunately most of the time we would have to say no I'm not okay I'm not judging you I'm sitting out on the Pew with you but you see what we need is a change in our thinking see I wanted to speak to you something to bring something to Enlighten to you the promise of God for this age see something not something that somebody else was in some other day mean Times Gone by but something and when them things are all right we all refer to those things but I thought I would try to bring something to your mind with these scriptures I got written here that would Enlighten you to know to make you a better soldier in the field that you're fighting in now to learn the tactics of the enemy so that you can block everything before it gets to you see the main thing is to learn to keep the punches off of you you as much as you can you see so we cannot go back and say I I I I'm I'm speaking from some personal experiences and you know an individual I'll just put it that way saying I sure wished I could go back to Paul's day I'm quite comfortable in leysia I'll be honest with you I'm quite comfortable here in Le oysa because you see the faith that it would have taken to be Overcomers in Paul's day is the same faith that you need to be an overcomer in this day if you can't overcome leysia you would not have overcome Paul's day if you had been in Ephesus you would not have overcome if you can't overcome here so why do you want to go back in time Amen to go to another day to look in that day thinking it would be an easier time it would have not been one drop easier than it is now amen and we are living in an age with the greatest Revelation that has been given the opening of the word amen the Seals Everything has been laid out before us and we are living in this day and there is Faith to overcome that in this day amen we do not need to go back to find something we can overcome amen we are Overcomers amen so what the prophet is saying here that would Enlighten you to know make you a better soldier in the field you're fighting in now now amen not in a field of another age not in a field of some time that people think there's some that think there's a whole another age to come well the eighth day my brother and sister is the bride's day amen and we will be uh fit and ready for that day why because the prophet of God already brought it out that we've stepped out of leod deia Amen we have stepped into the age of the Bride the word coming creating an over CER see that's where we're at today it's not I hope someday I will be I fell to that fallacy in my teenage years I told myself for years oh when this happens I I I'll I'll do better at serving God it happened I didn't and I was disappointed so I moved on to something else I come along to a stage of my life I thought if I get married amen that'll be the answer to all Paul's questions I'm marrying a Godly girl I mean I married a girl that was a perfect example as a daughter of God Amen except for when I made her mad but anyway uh well then it just showed she was human right but you see I got to that point married to a wonderful girl a girl that said you know Paul if you're not going to serve God I'm going to serve him anyway she's willing to stand up to the test of the household the test of the day in the household and she said I don't care I'm going to serve go God and my brother and sister I thought when I get to that place that will make the difference it didn't and that kept going right on and on and on and on until one day God by his grace and mercy come along and said you know what I've got something that's going to make you come to the place that you will be enlightened to the promise of God for you in this age amen that's a very personal message my brother and sister that's not a message just to say let's go back to what Paul preached Paul never talked to me directly but I can tell you in this day right here God has spoke to me directly amen the word has been opened directly in this day amen dealing with each and every one of us amen now look your battle is personal right amen when the devil tells you nobody's ever experienced this before he's actually telling you the truth because I could never be you and you could never be me but I tell you what we have we have a word that never changed from age to age to age amen from Individual to individual from church to church that word never changed amen and so your battle is a very personal battle and sometimes you know it's kind of stunning uh we're in South Africa sister Jerry there because we're dealing with some young ladies uh sister Jerry right there and and I just remember I was stunned I I was stunned I looked up at Jerry and Jerry's just kind of like wow because you shouldn't have 12 and 13y old children in those situations in those conditions under those those kind of influences and so the battle is really personal you know what I can think of one little young lady that we stood outside of the chapel there and she shared her story and and we're just I I was stunned and I thought you know I I found myself as a man starting to speak to say you know I understand and I bit those words off cuz one I've never been a girl and I've never been 13 with that kind of circumstance is our God awesome or not very personal God come right down open your mouth your mind's thinking a thought you open your mouth and different words come out you know what I'm talking about Brother David you're thinking this right here well I'll say this I'll sympathize a little bit you go to speak an entirely different word come out and it turns out those were exactly the words that were perfect for the moment and it left man completely out of the picture and it was all God and that makes it a personal message to that individual when you're surprised your own self of the words The Voice coming out of your own mouth when you're shocked I never thought of that I never pondered that I wasn't pres ready or to present that but it's God speaking and it changes a young lady's life my brother and sister we serve a personal God Amen and we've got a personal message from a personal God Amen God's word to you is very personal we can take the I I don't want it to be a cliche my brother and sister but uh we we well I'll skip that for a moment we need need to let the Lord speak to us on a personal level we shouldn't walk out of church today and say brother Paul preached A good sermon Paul don't have much to give you something speaks to your heart Pricks you reminds you that's God speaking to you that's God coming on a personal level to connect with you that you would realize he cares people say well I prayed and God never answered my brother and sister I sometimes wonder what their prayer really was how sincere were were they were they willing to take no for the answer to accept no the way they would accept yes God help us that's right because a no should be just as good as a yes amen your battle is personal the word is personal amen I always like this it's a it's a a example that we should all relate to because the prophet shares this the two men walking out of church and one says he called me a bozzer and one says he called me an eagle now my brother and sister what we don't know is what was the spirit they took into church right amen they come out being called a buzzard in their idea did they not take a buzzard spirit to church God is a god of love but he's also a god of judgment he's also a god of Truth amen and when truth comes now I know this will be getting personal don't lift your hands I don't embarrass themselves have you ever come to church with a bad attitude I want to make it simple I'm going to lift my hand for everyone here yes sir that's right and now you just answer for yourself we don't want to make too many things personal public what did you get out of the service and did you leave with a bad attitude but I've got something to bail y'all out let me help you with this it wasn't your fault the pastor didn't pray enough I've heard it come onen and the people who think that actually believe that my what our answer should be I came with with a bad attitude we all I've saw it on your faces so we can go from there you know your faces kind of tell on us don't it but if we walked out in a contrite spirit saying Lord forgive me that's it I don't want to get distracted here you see we got to get at the level God speaks to us amen now you see even back in those days was such a glorious time here in the United States the prophet is Chris crossing the country the Nations the world a and um you know they were still the scoffers when brother Brandon would say well the Lord spoke to me and there'd be people like no he doesn't do that anymore that's old that's old and brother brandham come along and he's talking a little different subject but the context is is the same he says I can show you where God put it in the church you show me where he took it out that's right see so there's so many conflicting Spirits because the people would say this is done this is finished and that comes right down into this day right now my brother and sister there's people that think we'd be just fine if we never ever ever uh did anything more than just knot our head a little bit never got any more uh demonstrative as it were and there's people and that's good but you have some over here that rejoicing in the word of God I'm not going to steal their rejoicing and their praise because I'm the quiet tender kind that tiptoe into church and would like the preacher to quit preaching because I'm thirsty they judge them they judge them you know what a personal God does he gives you unction he gives you unction you can yell Hallelujah you can whisper Hallelujah you can halfway through church after you've told your children don't want you walking in and out of church halfway through church you can get up and go to the water fountain your salvation's not at risk it's a personal message to you amen and young people hear me and hear me well please it's not Grandma and Grandpa's message that's right it's not Mom and Dad's message it's not the pastor's message it's got to be a personal message to you that's right there the reason we have a lot of troubles my brother and sister is because we' pampered our children children to keep them from the world we' we've tried to isolate them and that's well and good but in isolation we never got them in the presence of Christ amen we isolated him too well that's right amen I know that's a little straight but I don't want to be responsible that day to stand before God that I did not preach truth that I did not lay out a foundation that we could come to a place by simply being uh open and and letting God come to us let him speak to us we've got to give that opportunity to God Amen the prophet of God said that he's a gentleman he'll never barge his way into your life you have to give him opportunity to come Amen to show that he is real in this day amen hallelujah I'm kind of glad my brother and sister I know this probably will come across uh and I probably shouldn't even say it but I'm kind of glad that I don't have my parents' message amen our parents came out of denomination most of them they had a whole another set of baggage that they had to deal with that's right they had a lot of things they learned somewhere else that they had to decide does this fit or does it not they had a lot of baggage to unpack to move into the open word that's right I'm actually glad I don't have my parents' message amen but you see there would be others that they knew the whole story of my life would say I'm sure glad I don't have Paul's message but you say when God comes and he has a personal message for you did that all make sense to you guys I don't want to leave any Topsy Turvy out there my brother and sister you know when you when you grow up as a young child in a household going through some of my mother's effects and come across pictures and I'm not going to show that picture to any of you because you know the Lord chastize Brother brandham for calling them Ricky and that's a picture of a Ricky long hair defiant look and that's truly defined who I was but God had a personal message for me amen the Lord I've shoplifted I should oh did I say that out loud I've shof lifted I've broke every traffic law that there is I don't glorify this but I'm telling you my brother and sister some of these things would might be quite shocking we' done it but God said that's not who you are amen and now Paul I I have a message for you amen amen and in that message I had a hard time that's why I made the statement I said about my parents message I had a hard time of letting go of who Paul was things ingrained in Paul the Defiance the Rebellion the attitude oh don't look at me that way Saints I know you guys too well amen we have to let go with that amen because God's message to us has no room for Rebellion that's right it has no room for defiance it has no room for disrespect it has no room for blat and disregard of God's word hallelujah oh yeah it's to the age the message is it's to the church right the church has called out people but it goes deeper than that it's to you personally amen hallelujah I need to hurry up and close you know it's a personal word that makes you who you are amen we sit here today Overcomers it's God's personal word to you amen amen you can be reformed and you can be re-educated but the only thing that really matters is to be rebirthed amen amen that's the only one that really matters out of all of that hallelujah amen I tell you how it works give you an idea what it is to be changed I had a good friend in the construction world when I I left that I kind of our friendship kind of faded he was an alcoholic from the time he was about 12 13 years old he got up there about 35 had a wife and children and he got sick and tired of being sick and tired and he went to rehab after rehab after rehab and right after he got out of him he failed finally he went to a rehab and he whipped it and the last I ever had connections with him he had never drank again now I want you to catch this there's spiritual side to this I asked him one day I said how did you do this and he said well Paul I read the brochure years I didn't comprehend what they were talking about I checked in to this rehab they showed me my room they showed me the building they showed me all of the things and then they showed me the bar and I thought I'm paying 20 grand to go to a place that has a bar yep drink all you want he said when the sun went down the first day he was in there he was Stone drunk didn't even remember going to bed the next day he got up wandered down there there's all the alcohol and he said I thought this got to be a joke of some kind he went over poured him some alcohol and he's like they've ripped me off this is a scam but what he didn't know is they started putting something in the alcohol and he went in there and he drank drank all he could drink remembers that remember going to bed but he did remember falling out of bed and wretching in the middle of the night and wretching and the next day he was wretching and the day after that he was wretching until as a man who has finally beat alcoholism just the sniff of Al alcohol causes him to just oh I got to get out of here he said the one fallacy catch that Saints the one fallacy that I saw after the fact I still wanted to drink alcohol hope you follow me as we close God's personal message to you was not to make you sick of sin but to completely deliver you from it right not the idea of sin caused you to revolt but the scripture says the Apostle Paul says he took away the desire of it amen that's a personal message from God dealing with us not causing a countertype I've joked about it before we got some Believers in Montana I hope they don't listen to this you know let's just move way up in the mountains of Montana you guys know how beautiful it is up where brother Adrian sister aah are hey you know we could move out in the woods out there and we could just have some pretty strict laws about what can even be brought into to our colony and then we can enforce those rules on you but you know what happened there'd be some of us that figure out how to break the rules right cuz the colony in the mountains is not going to save us but God said my personal message to you is strong enough I'm going to take you right in the middle of leod deia and set you down and you are going to be the Overcomer amen you're going to be the one who is still living the word you're going to be the one that is still praising God you're going to be the one why it's not a fix it's a new birth amen a new creation and Christ has this personal message to you amen I think I'll just uh quit right there I got quite a bit more um but I would like to read this last little quote right here persant now see the works of God are for ordained of God do you believe that congregation says amen Jesus met a blind man one time and said who sinned him or his mother or so forth or his daddy neither one but the works of God might be made manifest see this is the work of God and when you feel something pressing to you hold on to it that's God speaking to you amen amen we're living in that time my brother and sister that the word has come amen it is hard let's see I think we raised our hand earlier and acknowledge that we maybe had a bad week or some struggle wonder why that would be is it because you're weak and have no faith is it because you might possibly be a lukewarm believer some would like you to believe that but I'll tell you what I would like you to believe exactly what the prophet taught this is God working manifesting his word in you going to be tested without a test going to be purified with no fire going to be an overcomer without any fiery darts come on we should be able to say Lord whatever you have for me that's right whatever comes my way Lord the word is more than enough amen amen I will learn how to fight I will quench oh let let me just so that so this won't come across as a soft soap sermon okay if you're not listening to the right music I hope the Lord deals with your heart I hope that he makes you feel like that you have just reached the very bottom if you are doing things amen if you're you know what I I'm allowed to preach this you know why I am cuz I was one if you're a chameleon you know I used to get on the school bus I look like the perfect little message boy I got on there my hair was combed amen the shirt you know everything get on the school bus by the time I got off the school bus my sleeves were rolled up the shirt tail was jerked out my pants were pulled down oh no that's not a new thing I got off the bus with attitude don't mess with me man yeah you know what I looked like when I got off the bus at home yes ma'am no ma'am let's not be chameleons I i' rather we be men and women young men young women strong enough to say you know what Pastor I'm struggling I need prayer I need a little help I need I need something I need you to help me break through something encourage me let the word encourag because I'm going to sit right here and say I can't fix your problem but I can pray for you amen I can change your life through prayer and when you realize it's God dealing with you you'll come to the the place you won't have to run to the pastor every time that's right you won't have to run to those you think are great men of God you'll be able to stop and say that's the devil and I know it's the devil that's a footprint of the devil and I'm not I'm not going there because as the opening quote we read the prophet wanted us to see how to fight against those things how to fight back to be uh a wear be prepared when Satan comes rars up his ugly head you can say oh oh I've got a bad attitude right now but that's a devil and my bad attitude uh w wow yeah that bad attitude is the devil I don't even want anything to do with this bad attitude because I don't want anything to do with the devil and suddenly my brother and sister we don't invite him in we don't sit down and drink tea with him no I read a quote once I don't remember a Spurgeon or one of those was talking about tea and the devil that's why I've never liked tea amen I I don't want to drink tea because I don't want to end up find myself sitting with the devil drinking tea amen but my brother to all the you that drink tea that's up to you amen but look at this my brother and sister we are here today because God has a message for you and and I am oh I'll throw one last ringer at you before we quit I'm not talking about brother Brown sermons God's got a message for you he wants to deliver it to you lip to ear amen he wants to get close enough to deliver his message to you amen amen will we let him y that's the question will we let him get close enough now don't misunderstand when I say that it's not the message if you have spiritual understanding you'll know what I'm talking about because we could walk in today with our Bible and 10 messages under our own and that won't change us but you ever get close enough and allow the Lord to get close enough to whisper in your ear you'll never be the same now I know none of you ever have temper tantrums and never suffer from the depressions and the anxieties I know none of you ever do that but those of us that aren't as strong we need to learn how to fight the devil and I say thank you Lord he's given us his word amen hallelujah you guys I know you love the Lord isn't that interesting how preachers are always like do you love the Lord I think I think what they're really trying to say is do you still love me yeah amen hallelujah yeah how many of you have Twitter yes it's a TR but we could put any other name in there Facebook I don't know what are the names of those things I'm so archaic it's just getting to be ridiculous but anyway you know maybe you don't use Twitter but I have it on here and it's good because most of you shook your head no so that makes it really good but does Twitter preach the gospel does Twitter ever condemn men of sin does Twitter ever cause a Revival now I'm going to step out whatever it is on your phone ask the same questions of that we've got a message message it was not delivered by Twitter it's a personal one-on-one Holy Ghost message delivered to you behold I send Leo deia Elijah the prophet does that scripture sound familiar behold I send your church Elijah the prophet what did he say somebody remind me behold I send you personal that's right is that okay I know I get all those things you know the teachers used to say diagram the sentence and um I figured out my teacher never wanted me back in English class and I'm not proud of that but it was effective so I just diagrammed them any old way and they'd all be marked I she loved him so much she highlighted them with a red marker and uh I know it shows I know it shows nouns pronouns adverbs those are all good I hope those will make some money for you someday but my brother and sister the one thing I do know is when something is personal and when it's personal you can recognize it as personal and the prophet delivered Elijah's gospel to us we have it delivered to you and I let's not let it sit on the Shelf let's not let it be diminished in value let's make it important as the scripture says our daily bread I don't know about you guys I love to eat amen and when you think about the word being as valuable to us
