[23:07] hey man once again i want to greet you
[23:08] all
[23:09] this morning and brother chris has an
[23:11] announcement why you come with chris
[23:13] this time
[23:23] go ahead yeah good morning everyone
[23:26] man keep this brief it's that time time
[23:28] of year again we're getting ready for
[23:30] our second annual
[23:33] race camp out
[23:35] so brother steve
[23:36] and sister sir coffee have agreed to
[23:38] come out for us
[23:40] so but the c will be speaking for us
[23:42] saturday night and sunday morning
[23:44] this year i wanted to be a little bit
[23:46] more
[23:48] church focused so
[23:50] we found a facility that had a nice
[23:52] pavilion with power in it um so that we
[23:55] can do that comfortably
[23:58] so friday night saturday night sunday
[24:00] morning friday night will be more of a
[24:02] singing and testimony service no no
[24:04] actual preaching
[24:05] but then saturday night sunday morning
[24:07] will be the regular services
[24:09] instead of the shared meals this year
[24:11] because of the services every night
[24:13] we're going to do shared refreshments
[24:15] after church
[24:17] around the fire so there's a central
[24:18] location where we can all share that
[24:20] special time together and that time of
[24:22] fellowship after church is always a
[24:24] little bit more special than before
[24:28] there's
[24:29] just a better way to organize it this
[24:31] year
[24:32] some people wanted to invite
[24:34] others and that's awesome
[24:37] we're going to send out a google form
[24:40] we're going to send out a form for you
[24:41] to fill out for your family how many
[24:42] people are coming
[24:44] and we need that
[24:45] to us by may 31st
[24:48] um
[24:49] well the everything will be in there for
[24:50] you to fill out to be simple and if
[24:52] there's anybody you want to invite send
[24:54] them the link to that form
[24:57] so that we can keep track of who else
[24:58] coming because
[25:01] not good not saying we're going to fill
[25:02] up but if
[25:04] people come as we're discussing we're
[25:06] going to be full
[25:10] so
[25:13] that is that about the church camp so
[25:15] we'll send out a form and all this
[25:17] obviously you're going to hear from me
[25:18] several more times because it's
[25:20] repetition works best
[25:25] so
[25:25] also
[25:27] wednesday night we did this i just kind
[25:28] of laid it on my little laid on my heart
[25:30] to
[25:31] send over to
[25:33] through brother berry a little video of
[25:35] encouragement you can take the poster
[25:38] down guys a little video of
[25:39] encouragement to the believers in
[25:41] ukraine you know we i know for for me
[25:43] and for most of you we when we saw the
[25:44] pictures of the people that we were
[25:46] praying for um we there was a connection
[25:48] right there's real people going through
[25:50] real situations and so i was talking you
[25:53] know brother barry sends the updates or
[25:55] gain uncle paul and other ones get them
[25:57] um so i was talking to him you know he
[25:59] he said he wished he could do more and i
[26:01] and i felt very humbled when he said
[26:03] that but um
[26:05] you know i thought we were we're helping
[26:07] financially we're helping with prayer
[26:09] but you know god gave us hands and feet
[26:11] to do something with
[26:13] and um
[26:14] not that prayer isn't good enough
[26:16] that's the best thing we can do so i
[26:18] thought you know why don't we put
[26:20] together a little video
[26:21] where each of us here say hello we're
[26:24] praying for you god bless you something
[26:26] very simple like that's a wednesday
[26:28] night we got most of you today we're
[26:30] going to get the rest of you
[26:34] if you wish to reshoot
[26:38] you can do so so directly after service
[26:40] um once you know that those that that
[26:43] lingered have have moved out will come
[26:45] and uh get
[26:47] each of you in turn to come say hello so
[26:48] stick around um
[26:50] just a simple hello or bless you we'll
[26:53] i'll put it together but the sergey is
[26:55] going to help me interpret it and we'll
[26:57] send it to brother barry and hopefully
[26:58] and pray that god will use that as a
[27:00] blessing and an encouragement and if you
[27:02] speak the language you can give your
[27:03] greetings in the language that'll save
[27:05] us
[27:06] interpreting it so
[27:09] that's all we have god bless you
[27:22] well i had no idea that brother chris
[27:23] was going to mention the ukraine
[27:26] so i just want to share with you
[27:29] that
[27:30] a few weeks ago
[27:32] we sent an offering of twenty five
[27:34] hundred dollars
[27:35] uh to brother barry and um
[27:38] uh
[27:40] my time slips by maybe it was yesterday
[27:42] evening
[27:43] friday evening we sent another twenty
[27:46] five hundred dollars
[27:47] and
[27:48] here in um
[27:50] maybe another
[27:52] two weeks or something of that nature
[27:56] we hope to have put together another 2
[27:59] 500 and
[28:00] so while i'm not here to ask for your
[28:02] money i'm just asking you uh if the lord
[28:05] lays on your heart
[28:08] to to support that
[28:10] um
[28:11] you know we have
[28:13] you can only imagine my brothers and
[28:15] sisters
[28:17] having a good as it were peaceful life
[28:21] having it completely disrupted
[28:24] but as we look at this and when you hear
[28:26] the testimonies of the believers there
[28:30] that they're not running they're not
[28:32] crying they are just declaring god's
[28:35] will for their life and they're standing
[28:37] solid they're having prayer meetings
[28:39] they are holding fast to the faith
[28:42] um and uh just uh
[28:44] you know you can see in different uh
[28:47] deals as as brother chris said i know
[28:50] brother sergey myself i'm not sure who
[28:52] else brother chris
[28:54] we're getting these updates and you see
[28:56] these videos these are people just like
[28:59] us
[29:00] just
[29:01] people have families uh as it were
[29:04] loving life living life and
[29:06] so uh whatever the lord would lay upon
[29:08] your heart um
[29:10] we will at a frequency here do our very
[29:14] best we're small church we have you
[29:16] might say somewhat limited resources
[29:19] but um
[29:20] if i was in that situation i would be so
[29:22] thankful for one
[29:24] the words of encouragement to know that
[29:26] uh real people real faces are praying
[29:29] for you
[29:30] and um so we want to reciprocate that
[29:33] because the day might come
[29:34] that we will be in that situation
[29:37] desiring the support and the prayer so
[29:40] if you feel led to offer to this
[29:43] you might just slip an envelope write
[29:46] ukraine on it and
[29:50] we'll just proceed forward but
[29:52] brother berry already has has uh given
[29:55] some feedback to that
[29:57] uh of saints there that their hearts are
[30:00] rejoicing uh brothers that have gone
[30:03] into the store
[30:05] literally this is one that he shared
[30:07] gone into the store on one day after
[30:10] almost immediately after receiving funds
[30:13] go to the store buy all they could place
[30:15] in their vehicle
[30:17] and the next day go back to that very
[30:20] same store to try to procure more uh
[30:23] food and and things and the store is
[30:26] completely empty
[30:27] and on this deal i tried to send the
[30:29] pictures the other day and i i couldn't
[30:31] i'm not bright enough i got one of them
[30:33] sent and sister sue's like is that the
[30:35] price of bread
[30:36] [Laughter]
[30:39] yeah you can go on hickory bible
[30:41] tabernacle and
[30:43] and it's all on there amen
[30:46] there's a few extra things as it is
[30:48] brother berry's sharing personally but
[30:50] but mostly it's just encapsulated there
[30:52] on hickory bible tabernacle and uh so
[30:55] what we're seeing saints is the absolute
[30:59] hand of the lord coming uh we see the
[31:01] saints uh leaving some of these places
[31:05] and while the world says that this area
[31:08] is completely surrounded by the military
[31:11] god has given them direction leadership
[31:13] to just turn down the right roads and to
[31:15] be able to just to be able to leave so
[31:18] keep them in your prayers as i know you
[31:20] have and this is very personal to those
[31:22] of you who uh come from the ukraine and
[31:26] uh you know it's it's just something
[31:28] that we hold deep in our heart and and
[31:31] we have as it were the very personal
[31:33] connection with our families here and um
[31:36] so
[31:37] just lift that up and we just do our
[31:39] best to continue to support them i say
[31:41] god bless you saints
[31:44] amen hey man it's good to have brother
[31:47] jose and sister steffi the family with
[31:49] us but jose's gonna be coming and
[31:51] speaking the word to us as he comes
[31:53] let's sing that song so much to thank
[31:55] him for
[31:58] when i look
[32:00] around and see the good things
[32:04] he has done for me i know
[32:08] i'm unworthy of them all
[32:14] but his
[32:15] blessings he freely gives i owe
[32:21] my whole life to him i've got so much to
[32:25] thank

[39:41] we're going to stop there and then we're

[40:22] forgiven you all trespasses
[40:25] having wiped out the
[40:28] handwriting and requirements that was

[40:32] which was contrary to us and he has
[40:34] taken it away
[40:37] having neil
[40:38] nailed it to the cross
[40:41] let's let's pray
[40:44] heavenly father we thank you lord
[40:47] we know we can do
[40:49] a lot of things too much lord but pray
[40:53] is never too much
[40:55] lord we ask you this morning to come and
[40:57] help me lord as i can
[40:59] as i try to speak father i
[41:02] want you to
[41:04] help us lauren and
[41:07] be help to someone lord
[41:12] i ask you to come and
[41:14] be the guest of honor in this place
[41:16] lauren
[41:18] we thank you father for the blessings
[41:20] you've been
[41:21] giving us till today lord in the name of
[41:24] the lord jesus christ we pray
[41:26] amen
[41:28] i am
[41:32] you know there is a
[41:35] there was a story about a king
[41:40] this king had a lot of
[41:45] helpers there and then one of them was
[41:48] a christian
[41:50] and he always
[41:53] if something happened he always
[41:56] told the king don't worry king
[41:59] everything is going to be fine god is
[42:01] good
[42:03] and
[42:04] he knows the reasons
[42:06] behind
[42:08] that
[42:10] what's going on and and
[42:12] so the king was
[42:14] a little bit of
[42:16] i guess a little too much of
[42:20] god is good and why he's so much
[42:24] saying about god is good and he
[42:26] so one day he
[42:27] decided
[42:28] to go to
[42:32] to go to hunting in
[42:34] on the middle of the
[42:41] nowhere up in the mountains
[42:44] a bear came and attacked the king
[42:47] and the servant
[42:50] managed to kill the bear but
[42:52] he couldn't save
[42:53] the king by losing a finger
[42:56] so the king got really upset
[43:00] and the servant said don't worry my king
[43:03] i gradual life
[43:05] although i couldn't manage to save you
[43:07] to finger but god is good
[43:09] we're alive
[43:11] so he went they went home
[43:15] and
[43:18] when they were home he got really upset
[43:20] again
[43:22] because
[43:23] the servant came to him again and said
[43:26] god is good my king
[43:28] so he ordered to put him in prison
[43:32] and the next day the king decided to go
[43:35] hunting again
[43:36] and he got too deep on the
[43:39] woods
[43:41] and savage tribe caught him and
[43:46] they were
[43:47] looking for someone for sacrifices
[43:51] so they caught the king and taken to the
[43:54] sacrifice
[43:56] place and
[43:58] finally when they were about to
[43:59] sacrifice they found out that it was
[44:02] a finger was missing so it wasn't
[44:04] perfect
[44:05] for a sacrifice
[44:08] so he came back scared and afraid and
[44:11] happy at the same time
[44:13] so he ordered he came back to the
[44:15] kingdom and he ordered to
[44:17] bring his servant back
[44:20] and he said
[44:22] i start believing what you're saying
[44:24] but i don't understand one thing why if
[44:26] god is so good why he allowed me to
[44:29] put you in prison
[44:31] today and he told the story i always
[44:34] i was almost killed
[44:36] but because of my finger
[44:38] and he the servant says my king
[44:43] everything works for good
[44:44] because if you wouldn't put me in prison
[44:47] i was going to be the sacrifice
[44:51] and then the king finally got it
[44:55] so
[44:56] see
[44:58] sometimes we go through
[45:02] difficult difficulties in life
[45:05] and
[45:07] we don't understand and we're never
[45:09] gonna understand
[45:12] until
[45:14] it's in the past
[45:17] and that
[45:19] hardship that you went through
[45:21] is going to help someone on the road
[45:22] that's right
[45:24] because your tests
[45:27] they become testimonies yes
[45:30] and your trials they become triumphs
[45:34] and hands of the lord
[45:35] amen so
[45:37] today like i say
[45:39] you're gonna have to bear with me a few
[45:40] minutes
[45:42] i don't know
[45:43] uh
[45:44] it's 11 right 11 10.
[45:48] so uh
[45:49] i uh
[45:53] if i give you the whole background
[45:55] we're gonna have to come back this
[45:56] afternoon so
[45:57] i'm gonna
[45:59] i'm gonna chop it off a little bit
[46:01] so my and i kind of tell a tall brother
[46:04] paul uh last time was here we we went to
[46:06] his house and
[46:08] uh when we when we received the message
[46:10] the the
[46:12] william branham's message
[46:15] i was like
[46:16] seven eight years old
[46:18] we were we were living in a
[46:21] basically a jungle
[46:23] and we didn't have
[46:24] uh
[46:26] we didn't have any uh a way a way to
[46:30] transport other than donkeys and mules
[46:32] and horses if we're lucky
[46:35] so
[46:36] um
[46:37] being a kid just taking care of goats
[46:41] milking goats drinking milk and
[46:44] just living
[46:45] in nature
[46:48] so
[46:48] of course not video games no nothing
[46:50] like that no cell phones
[46:52] and
[46:54] i uh
[46:56] uh we grew up
[46:57] my brother
[46:59] is two years older than me i'm the i'm
[47:01] the youngest of nine
[47:04] i don't know my monk how she handled
[47:06] that much kids but
[47:08] is uh
[47:09] uh we
[47:11] uh we had a
[47:13] i don't want to say a rough life but
[47:15] i think we had a a life good life so we
[47:18] can learn
[47:20] the good from the bad and and
[47:23] and my mom uh
[47:25] she didn't know how to write or read she
[47:27] went to school maybe a couple years and
[47:29] then
[47:30] decide to have kids i guess
[47:33] and my dad he never learned
[47:35] how to write or lead or read but
[47:38] he knows how to count so when someone
[47:40] was paying him hey you're missing a bill
[47:42] here so
[47:44] but he learned that i think it was
[47:46] important right
[47:48] so uh
[47:49] so we we
[47:50] my mom
[47:52] was catholic
[47:54] 100
[47:55] i think one of the
[47:57] if you want to call someone catholic i
[47:59] will say she was
[48:01] the original
[48:02] because what she what she believed
[48:06] it wasn't that
[48:09] that image because she had a
[48:11] a picture like this big
[48:14] and she made rosaries i will
[48:17] i don't want to lie but i i i'm almost
[48:19] positive was every night for 30 minutes
[48:22] on her knees and she was doing this
[48:24] rosary
[48:26] i never learned it
[48:28] but uh i uh
[48:30] so by i think by the age i think my
[48:34] sister the
[48:36] the fourth kid is a woman which is lives
[48:39] in colorado my sister margarita
[48:41] i think she was around 15 and she had a
[48:44] she went through a situation in life i
[48:46] don't know nobody knows what was it but
[48:48] i think was a calling from god i say i
[48:51] will call it
[48:52] because
[48:53] she's been raised catholic all these
[48:55] years and uh
[48:57] and then she had this encounter with
[49:00] with
[49:01] something
[49:02] and she ran
[49:04] a little deeper in the in the woods
[49:07] and and she
[49:09] was looking straight up
[49:11] and then my mom she didn't know anything
[49:13] else she was
[49:15] praying
[49:16] catholic rosary
[49:18] and and holy mary and this and that
[49:21] and uh
[49:23] my sister finally said stop mom
[49:26] you don't pray to her she can help us
[49:29] you pray to god
[49:36] my mom was hurt
[49:40] because it was what she knew
[49:45] and
[49:46] however she could
[49:48] she she started praying to to the lord
[49:52] and then she started coming it was kind
[49:54] of
[49:57] nervous situation for her i don't know
[49:59] what was
[50:01] my mom
[50:02] again being catholic
[50:05] took her to a priest catholic priest in
[50:07] the closest
[50:09] little bigger town
[50:10] and the catholic priest says i don't
[50:12] know what it is
[50:15] and she took it to the doctor and the
[50:17] doctor says i can't find anything wrong
[50:19] with her
[50:21] but the catholic priest give give my mom
[50:24] gave my mom a new testament
[50:27] that's how
[50:30] yeah
[50:34] my mom
[50:36] learned how to read
[50:43] forgive me
[50:45] is
[50:50] then my mom started reading the book the
[50:52] new testament
[50:55] and uh she uh
[50:58] she started having a lot of questions
[51:00] about it
[51:02] so the first source
[51:05] of answers was the catholic priest
[51:08] so my mom started reading the apocalypse
[51:11] revelation about
[51:12] who's the harlot who's this the
[51:15] the daughters of the heart
[51:16] what is all this
[51:19] because i mean when you're reading the
[51:20] book for the first time
[51:23] it's
[51:24] scary
[51:27] and
[51:28] the catholic priest told her
[51:30] oh you don't need to go that
[51:32] yet just go back to matthew
[51:34] read the gospels
[51:37] of course my mom did what the priest
[51:38] told her but
[51:39] and back in her head still
[51:42] what's going on here
[51:44] because if i'm reading here i gotta at
[51:46] some point
[51:47] i gotta go back
[51:48] here so
[51:51] she kept reading
[51:54] and
[51:56] around that
[51:58] i was still
[51:59] a kid and and a lot of things
[52:02] i don't remember very well but i'm which
[52:04] i'm not going to make up anything
[52:06] so
[52:08] i'm going to tell what i remember but
[52:10] some sometime after that she went to
[52:12] visit uh
[52:14] relatives in another state in mexico is
[52:17] called morelos
[52:19] and over there my brother my dad's
[52:22] brother
[52:23] became pentecostal
[52:25] and he gave my mom a cassette tape
[52:29] for those kids you know what cancer tape
[52:31] is
[52:34] is it like a cd these days
[52:37] but it's a different form
[52:39] you can google it later
[52:42] but uh
[52:43] so in this cassette tape it was a
[52:46] testimony of a brother was
[52:49] his name is paulino bernal he
[52:52] you know we were kids so one side was he
[52:55] said 30 minutes his testimony and the
[52:57] other 30 minutes on the other side was
[52:59] songs beautiful songs
[53:02] so
[53:04] we
[53:05] as kids being in the jungle that was the
[53:07] only distraction we had
[53:10] so we put that
[53:11] 24
[53:12] 7. we memorized the testimony and my
[53:16] brother
[53:17] memorized the testimony his testimony
[53:20] and we memorized the songs
[53:23] don't ask me
[53:25] today
[53:26] but
[53:27] that was when i was a kid so
[53:30] i uh
[53:32] i remember that my dad started getting
[53:34] upset
[53:37] i'm gonna take that i said i'm gonna
[53:38] throw her all the way up where you guys
[53:40] don't pick it up again
[53:43] so we played when he was in the home
[53:47] when he came back home we just stopped
[53:51] but somehow
[53:52] started
[53:54] uh
[53:56] we we we kind of like it
[53:58] my mom
[53:59] i fell in love with that testimony
[54:03] and she
[54:04] loved more reading the new testament
[54:07] so one day it was time for us to go to
[54:10] school and because we live in the jungle
[54:12] the
[54:12] the teacher that was
[54:15] supposed to be our teacher over there in
[54:16] the in the jungle
[54:18] someone
[54:20] kidnapped her and
[54:22] took her with him
[54:24] and
[54:25] so we had no teacher
[54:28] and then they decided to bring a guy
[54:31] and say maybe this guy is ugly nobody
[54:33] will like him
[54:34] so
[54:35] he is
[54:36] i think he stayed there for a year or
[54:38] two
[54:39] and he quit
[54:41] so
[54:42] we had to move to a little bigger town
[54:45] so there was school for us
[54:47] and
[54:49] but before that my mom somehow she
[54:53] figured out how she managed
[54:55] how to
[54:58] go to church
[55:01] and when we get to the top to the town i
[55:03] remember below the house where my my my
[55:07] brother rented
[55:08] there was a neighbor
[55:10] and this neighbor
[55:12] the
[55:14] sister and the
[55:15] daughters
[55:16] were
[55:17] she my mom saw them
[55:19] dressed different
[55:21] and
[55:22] my mom she couldn't stay quiet so she
[55:25] approached her and said hey
[55:27] are you catholic are you christian no no
[55:29] we're christians and then there's tall
[55:31] talking
[55:32] and they say well
[55:34] i have some questions that i've been
[55:37] dealing with all these years and i i
[55:40] haven't found anyone that can answer
[55:42] and she said well
[55:44] uh this sunday
[55:46] a missionary is coming
[55:49] so you can ask him anything
[55:52] so my mom managed
[55:55] i think she lied to my dad i don't know
[55:56] but
[55:57] she's she stayed that sunday
[56:00] to go to church
[56:02] and
[56:03] and she
[56:06] didn't
[56:07] waste time
[56:08] so she went and asked
[56:11] she went straight to him and asked him
[56:14] what is all this
[56:16] and the brother
[56:18] told her
[56:19] everything
[56:22] then my mom went back home
[56:25] grabbed that virgin mary a picture
[56:28] put it away
[56:30] a couple of friends that she had there
[56:32] got mad at her because what she was
[56:34] doing
[56:35] was wrong
[56:37] my mom wasn't disrespectful with them i
[56:40] said i think i found what i was looking
[56:42] for
[56:45] so since then my mom managed to
[56:49] manage a way to deal with my dad so my
[56:51] dad was upset
[56:53] he didn't want he didn't want to change
[56:56] religion
[56:58] but uh
[57:00] uh my mom every time you say
[57:02] uh isidro is my dad's name is
[57:07] this weekend i gotta go to buy groceries
[57:11] okay but you come saturday no
[57:14] i'm coming sunday afternoon
[57:17] so it's three hours on horseback riding
[57:20] from the jungle to the town
[57:23] and then we took
[57:25] another car
[57:26] to go to church to another town
[57:31] and sometimes my mom because my dad got
[57:34] upset
[57:38] that's what i
[57:39] want to think of because
[57:41] there was no reason why my mom will come
[57:43] along to to
[57:46] to town to buy groceries when she had a
[57:49] two daughters and
[57:51] two
[57:51] two sons
[57:53] with my dad doing nothing
[57:55] but sometimes my mom had to come along
[57:58] and come back like three o'clock in the
[57:59] morning in the middle of nowhere
[58:01] she was riding a mule
[58:04] by herself
[58:05] and she did it i don't know for how long
[58:07] i don't want to lie
[58:10] but
[58:12] she started praying i mean if if there
[58:14] is a woman of faith that's one of
[58:17] that i know yeah
[58:19] and she started praying about so
[58:22] a way that she can bring
[58:24] the kids that left at home
[58:27] to church
[58:29] so
[58:30] somehow i don't know what agreement they
[58:33] had but
[58:34] all of a sudden uh one weekend my mom
[58:38] was bringing
[58:40] a brother and sister with her
[58:42] then the next weekend the other two and
[58:44] we were like that for a few
[58:47] periods of time and
[58:49] and obviously we we as a kids been in
[58:52] the jungle i mean even if if we if we
[58:54] heard a more uh uh
[58:56] a motorcycle we will run and hide
[58:58] because we didn't know what was that
[59:01] that kind of situation we lived in and
[59:05] and uh
[59:07] i uh
[59:08] i remember that we went to church
[59:10] because i mean i wanted to go go out
[59:13] i just i was tired of milking cows in
[59:18] and goats and
[59:20] i didn't know anything about the city or
[59:21] nothing
[59:23] so
[59:24] but we started
[59:26] when we moved to the to the town
[59:29] my dad was really upset because he still
[59:32] wanted to continue
[59:35] on his
[59:36] field but even though
[59:37] we didn't see any money we didn't see
[59:39] much crops and he still wanted to be
[59:41] there
[59:42] finally
[59:44] a miracle happened and
[59:46] he sold all the properties that he had
[59:48] up there
[59:49] and he stayed
[59:52] in the town where there was
[59:54] transportation
[59:56] so
[59:57] like i say i'm gonna be chopping this
[59:59] because the time
[1:00:01] but so we started going to church more
[1:00:03] often and every sunday my mom
[1:00:08] like i said i don't want to lie but as
[1:00:10] far as i remember
[1:00:12] she never missed a service even in covet
[1:00:16] she say i don't want to miss one i don't
[1:00:18] know what you're going to do son but
[1:00:20] i want to be there
[1:00:22] if three people go there i want to be
[1:00:24] one of them
[1:00:26] so even if she was sick super sick
[1:00:29] she will never complain
[1:00:32] unless she was in bed in the hospital
[1:00:35] so
[1:00:37] we
[1:00:38] start going to church and and
[1:00:40] of course we start
[1:00:42] growing being in teenage
[1:00:45] age and
[1:00:47] to be honest i don't i don't remember
[1:00:50] struggling in my teenage
[1:00:52] years because
[1:00:54] i think i was busy working
[1:00:57] and
[1:00:59] when your mind is busy
[1:01:02] uh is less chances that you start
[1:01:08] planning things that you shouldn't be
[1:01:10] planning
[1:01:12] so
[1:01:14] i uh
[1:01:15] i i started working when i was 14
[1:01:18] and
[1:01:19] of course
[1:01:21] uh 16
[1:01:24] 17
[1:01:25] 15 16 years
[1:01:27] that's when we start
[1:01:30] looking for someone right
[1:01:34] and
[1:01:36] i say well i'm 15 16.
[1:01:41] i got to find a girlfriend when i wa
[1:01:43] when i'll be 17
[1:01:45] i'm gonna ask
[1:01:47] her hand because that's how like
[1:01:50] engage me here that's that's what it
[1:01:51] does we do in mexico or
[1:01:53] latin america
[1:01:55] so i want to ask for her hand and at the
[1:01:57] age 18
[1:01:59] then 1920 i'm gonna get married
[1:02:02] yeah right
[1:02:06] but you know what
[1:02:08] we as a young people
[1:02:11] even though we don't know
[1:02:13] uh we ignore a lot of things how
[1:02:17] how to approach
[1:02:20] a woman
[1:02:22] because we we try i tried to date
[1:02:26] daughters from brothers
[1:02:29] and
[1:02:31] i don't know they didn't like me even
[1:02:34] the dads were like
[1:02:36] and you know what i always had this this
[1:02:39] um
[1:02:42] i don't know how you say trauma maybe
[1:02:44] because i was from a country i was a
[1:02:46] country boy
[1:02:47] i had no money i had no properties my
[1:02:49] dad sold them all and
[1:02:51] and uh
[1:02:52] besides those properties didn't worth
[1:02:55] much but
[1:02:57] uh so i had that
[1:02:59] trauma in in you and i
[1:03:02] and and and at one point i this i i said
[1:03:06] well
[1:03:06] i had nothing to offer
[1:03:09] to someone
[1:03:11] when i'm wasting time
[1:03:13] so i kind of let go
[1:03:15] and besides i tried to date the
[1:03:19] brothers christians daughters
[1:03:21] didn't work out
[1:03:24] so i'm gonna convert one
[1:03:27] i'm a good
[1:03:28] christian i i'm gonna but you know what
[1:03:32] i i uh
[1:03:37] i'm not gonna say i i was the best
[1:03:39] christian
[1:03:41] young boy christian boy
[1:03:43] but you know
[1:03:45] my mom when we were kids
[1:03:48] uh
[1:03:50] my mom gave us a new testament because
[1:03:52] she was all she afford a new testament
[1:03:55] and give us a notepad and she said every
[1:03:59] time we go to church
[1:04:01] you have to pay attention to the
[1:04:02] preacher
[1:04:03] write down the scriptures
[1:04:06] and when we come
[1:04:09] you're gonna read to the during the week
[1:04:12] go back and read again
[1:04:17] my mom wasn't a minister
[1:04:20] my dad wasn't a minister
[1:04:22] but you know what
[1:04:24] i think she was doing a great job
[1:04:29] because
[1:04:30] she told us
[1:04:32] the best she could
[1:04:34] she thought i was the best
[1:04:35] she could
[1:04:37] and
[1:04:39] so down in my heart
[1:04:41] even though i wanna
[1:04:44] uh sometimes i got this thought
[1:04:49] i wanna go hang out with this
[1:04:52] my friends and
[1:04:53] girlfriends and
[1:04:56] so i grew up
[1:04:58] in um
[1:05:00] like i said i started working in a hotel
[1:05:02] 14 years old
[1:05:03] and they fired me because i was too
[1:05:06] young because
[1:05:07] someone else that was young as well got
[1:05:09] got uh
[1:05:11] hurt the job and the
[1:05:14] some government company
[1:05:16] sued them and and so i they had to kick
[1:05:19] me out because i was underage to be
[1:05:22] working
[1:05:23] but i say uh
[1:05:25] hey uh
[1:05:28] how about i can uh oh because before
[1:05:30] that i start
[1:05:33] they call them
[1:05:35] bailments or bell boys the ones help you
[1:05:37] with the luggages
[1:05:39] and i say
[1:05:42] i started i just started practicing
[1:05:45] there you know at that age
[1:05:48] i i i wanted to speak english
[1:05:52] so when a tourist came to the hotel and
[1:05:55] i was washing dishes and and uh
[1:06:00] white guys came to eat in the fancy
[1:06:03] restaurant that i
[1:06:04] and i was like this
[1:06:10] and i said
[1:06:12] what
[1:06:13] nice is that language
[1:06:16] i want to learn it
[1:06:18] and then we start listening tapes from
[1:06:20] brother bernie bilingual bernie garcia
[1:06:24] so that
[1:06:26] kind of opened my interest in the
[1:06:29] english language a little even more
[1:06:31] so
[1:06:32] when i was working in the hotel
[1:06:35] uh i saw the my co-workers
[1:06:38] speaking with the
[1:06:40] client and i couldn't
[1:06:43] and i said one day i'm gonna be able to
[1:06:45] do that
[1:06:47] so i went and took some english class
[1:06:50] but
[1:06:51] didn't work out because it was a mexican
[1:06:53] teaching me english
[1:06:59] so
[1:07:01] i went to different school
[1:07:03] and there was another mexican teaching
[1:07:04] me english
[1:07:06] but that's the school that i could
[1:07:07] afford
[1:07:09] so finally in the hotel i um
[1:07:12] i think i found grayson the
[1:07:14] human resources guy and say okay we're
[1:07:16] going to let you come just to practice
[1:07:18] but you don't clock in or out nothing
[1:07:21] whatever you make and tips
[1:07:25] but
[1:07:26] on a high season
[1:07:28] i get to make like uh
[1:07:30] 1500 pesos
[1:07:32] which nowadays is like 15
[1:07:36] 20
[1:07:37] a week
[1:07:38] which back then was
[1:07:40] for a kid 15 years old i think it was
[1:07:42] plenty money right
[1:07:45] so
[1:07:46] then i
[1:07:47] became uh
[1:07:50] older 18 years old okay they
[1:07:52] they hired me back the
[1:07:54] hotel but they didn't they didn't want
[1:07:57] me because
[1:07:58] i will i always i always been uh
[1:08:01] that kind of person that is is not
[1:08:03] satisfied with
[1:08:05] doing one thing only i want to learn
[1:08:07] okay i i learned this but what what else
[1:08:11] so then i moved to a different area
[1:08:15] i i learned how to flip eggs like this
[1:08:18] because i was tired of
[1:08:20] washing dishes only and
[1:08:22] and i said
[1:08:24] where else i'm gonna go from here
[1:08:26] so i started looking in the into the
[1:08:28] kitchen but the the
[1:08:30] the atmosphere in the kitchen i didn't
[1:08:32] like it
[1:08:33] because
[1:08:35] too many bad things happen there
[1:08:38] and if i tell you you you don't want to
[1:08:40] go eat in restaurants
[1:08:45] so
[1:08:46] i had a
[1:08:48] i had this opportunity to be in the
[1:08:52] in the
[1:08:53] front desk area
[1:08:54] even though i didn't speak english
[1:08:57] i uh
[1:08:58] i always wanted at least to listen
[1:09:02] whoever speak english
[1:09:04] so i was there
[1:09:05] and then when they
[1:09:07] hired me back
[1:09:08] the general manager hired me as uh
[1:09:11] they they titled me
[1:09:14] uh
[1:09:17] bus
[1:09:18] bus boy i think it was
[1:09:21] or
[1:09:24] i don't know what title they gave me but
[1:09:25] they gave me a little money
[1:09:27] that's all i remember very well the
[1:09:29] money wasn't enough
[1:09:32] because i lost the opportunity of being
[1:09:34] on the
[1:09:35] helping the customers with the luggage
[1:09:37] so i can make extra dollars there
[1:09:40] and
[1:09:42] so i uh
[1:09:44] i was
[1:09:45] his personal driver basically and and
[1:09:48] he's been his driver i had to be in
[1:09:51] different offices and different places
[1:09:54] important people
[1:09:56] but
[1:09:57] i i still knew that i was a christian i
[1:10:00] never forget that yeah
[1:10:03] even though i
[1:10:04] i kind of
[1:10:06] interact with
[1:10:07] different
[1:10:08] important people per se
[1:10:11] but i still knew that i was a christian
[1:10:13] and i still always my mom that's the
[1:10:16] other thing that she always
[1:10:18] remind us
[1:10:20] whatever you do any kind of work you do
[1:10:23] just don't forget that you need the
[1:10:25] sunday aft so you can go to church
[1:10:28] so we always had that in
[1:10:30] in our heart because if it was here it
[1:10:32] was gone next day
[1:10:35] and we
[1:10:36] so
[1:10:37] every time i could
[1:10:39] i had sunday stuff so i go to church
[1:10:42] and being in that position it was an
[1:10:44] office
[1:10:46] um
[1:10:47] shift
[1:10:48] so i was able to have saturday and
[1:10:51] sunday off
[1:10:52] but saturday i went back to help with
[1:10:54] the luggage again and i get an extra
[1:10:57] money
[1:10:58] and they didn't care i mean
[1:11:01] and
[1:11:03] but the enemy will never stop trying
[1:11:07] to bring you down
[1:11:10] so after working there a few years
[1:11:13] in the general manager's office
[1:11:16] the owner of the hotel requested me to
[1:11:18] be his driver
[1:11:20] so then i went back to the
[1:11:22] i went to his office now i was
[1:11:26] working with him
[1:11:28] taking the his
[1:11:30] kids that wasn't his but it was his
[1:11:32] wife's kids to the school
[1:11:34] and picked him up back and doing
[1:11:37] whatever he wanted me to do and
[1:11:42] some sometime
[1:11:43] and that that when
[1:11:46] i was there working the secretary
[1:11:49] his secretary told me okay this is going
[1:11:51] to be your duties
[1:11:53] every time you come here
[1:11:55] you get into the engineer's office
[1:11:58] empty the trash can
[1:12:01] and replace his
[1:12:03] pitch water
[1:12:04] okay
[1:12:06] so that was
[1:12:08] my routine
[1:12:10] and then one day
[1:12:14] one day
[1:12:16] i came to the office
[1:12:18] and i saw a magazine and the trash can
[1:12:21] with beautiful loveseats
[1:12:24] expensive ones
[1:12:25] a catalog
[1:12:28] and
[1:12:29] i thought say i think he threw this by
[1:12:32] mistake so i'm gonna
[1:12:33] take it out and put it on the
[1:12:35] secretary's desk if he if he asks for it
[1:12:38] he's there
[1:12:41] okay
[1:12:42] so that
[1:12:44] day the gentleman came in
[1:12:47] and i think he got up with the left foot
[1:12:49] or i don't know what happened
[1:12:50] but
[1:12:53] he fired me
[1:12:54] and he didn't fire me
[1:12:56] he told the general controller
[1:12:59] which i never had any touch with him
[1:13:02] to tell me that i was fired
[1:13:05] and i said why why what did i do
[1:13:08] he's he said i don't know
[1:13:10] well i want to know
[1:13:12] because as far as i know i've been
[1:13:15] honest and i've been doing a good job
[1:13:17] even though they don't pay me much but
[1:13:21] so i said i want to go talk to him
[1:13:24] i said no you can't oh yes i can
[1:13:27] so i called the secretary and say hey is
[1:13:29] the engineer there
[1:13:31] she said yes but he's really mad you
[1:13:32] don't want to be here
[1:13:34] oh no i'm on my way
[1:13:37] so
[1:13:38] i got there
[1:13:41] and
[1:13:43] i just barged into the office i didn't
[1:13:45] knock
[1:13:47] and i say i know i'm fired
[1:13:50] you can do anything else
[1:13:52] but i want to know why
[1:13:55] and
[1:13:56] i want an answer now
[1:13:59] and he said he said well you've been
[1:14:02] digging into my paperwork here
[1:14:06] i don't have business in your paperwork
[1:14:07] your paperwork's in english i don't
[1:14:09] speak english
[1:14:12] why you're saying that well what is my
[1:14:14] magazine
[1:14:16] your magazine isn't the enormous desk i
[1:14:18] put it there because you had it in the
[1:14:20] trash can
[1:14:21] i want to know why i'm fired
[1:14:24] but you don't want me here that's fine
[1:14:26] i'm on my way up
[1:14:28] i had my conscience clean
[1:14:31] but
[1:14:32] you know like like i was saying in the
[1:14:34] beginning sometimes you go through
[1:14:36] things
[1:14:37] that is hard for me
[1:14:39] it was
[1:14:40] really hard because
[1:14:43] i think i thought i was doing a good job
[1:14:46] but you know when god doesn't want you
[1:14:48] in one place
[1:14:50] he's going to allow things happen even
[1:14:52] though
[1:14:53] messes up your head a little bit
[1:14:57] but he's going to move you
[1:15:00] and
[1:15:03] a few
[1:15:05] i will say months before
[1:15:07] there was a
[1:15:09] an older woman but still young but it
[1:15:11] was after me and everybody everybody
[1:15:14] knew
[1:15:15] but i was still
[1:15:17] kind of innocent i didn't know and all
[1:15:19] of a sudden she started asking me if i
[1:15:21] can give her massages
[1:15:24] and you know what
[1:15:25] that's
[1:15:27] when
[1:15:28] i got to think i said god
[1:15:30] you know what you're doing i'm not gonna
[1:15:32] get upset
[1:15:34] i know what you're doing
[1:15:36] is perfect
[1:15:37] like i say i'm not claiming that i was
[1:15:39] the best christian or perfect
[1:15:42] but you know what one thing i knew was
[1:15:44] god put something a seed in my heart
[1:15:48] that it doesn't matter what you do
[1:15:50] if you don't listen
[1:15:53] for
[1:15:54] in a good way he's going to make you
[1:15:55] listen the hard way
[1:15:57] this is up to us really
[1:16:01] so then when i remember that i say okay
[1:16:04] lord thank you
[1:16:06] and everybody
[1:16:07] the the the people that i was in touch
[1:16:09] with
[1:16:10] and the front desk area the offices
[1:16:13] i was
[1:16:14] so trusted
[1:16:16] that they sent me to the bank with a
[1:16:17] hundred thousand dollars
[1:16:20] to deposit
[1:16:21] because back then there was no
[1:16:23] electronic to
[1:16:24] so i had
[1:16:27] and that didn't go anywhere
[1:16:30] and
[1:16:30] the the general
[1:16:33] controller
[1:16:34] many times she she called me hey can you
[1:16:36] come and help me to count this money
[1:16:38] because i want you to go
[1:16:41] that's why they were
[1:16:43] why why what did you do what happened
[1:16:46] and i only knew and god
[1:16:49] knew what happened
[1:16:51] and
[1:16:53] that's that's what i'm saying
[1:16:55] god's grace
[1:16:58] we we don't do nothing
[1:17:00] so he can give us the grace
[1:17:04] i mean
[1:17:05] how special more special
[1:17:08] was i
[1:17:09] at that time
[1:17:10] than the other people that i grew up in
[1:17:12] church
[1:17:13] but they're
[1:17:14] gone
[1:17:16] i didn't do anything else anything
[1:17:18] special
[1:17:20] it's just god's protecting
[1:17:23] his gift
[1:17:28] i uh moved
[1:17:31] to uh i started working in a carpentry
[1:17:33] shop
[1:17:35] and
[1:17:36] when i was there
[1:17:38] uh
[1:17:39] someone called me working in a travel
[1:17:41] agency
[1:17:42] see that the english thing was on my
[1:17:45] head and being in a carpenter shop i
[1:17:47] lost it
[1:17:49] i mean i forgot that i was interested in
[1:17:51] learning the language
[1:17:52] but then all of a sudden this lady
[1:17:54] called me say hey can you
[1:17:57] i heard you're
[1:17:58] looking for work i said no i wasn't
[1:18:01] she said well if you want to work we we
[1:18:04] i work in a travel agency we need
[1:18:06] someone
[1:18:07] to pick up guests in the airport and
[1:18:10] send to hotel and vice versa
[1:18:14] and uh carpenter job
[1:18:16] everybody were drug addicts
[1:18:20] smoking pot and sniffing the white stuff
[1:18:24] and
[1:18:25] there was me
[1:18:30] the guy who brought me there
[1:18:33] he said
[1:18:35] you don't have to do it but
[1:18:37] if you want
[1:18:40] i said no thank you
[1:18:42] and i i i think i was there for
[1:18:46] four months max
[1:18:48] and
[1:18:51] so when she called me i said okay i'm
[1:18:53] out of here
[1:18:55] and i say
[1:18:56] but
[1:18:58] on one condition she said what
[1:19:02] i need sundays off
[1:19:05] oh
[1:19:06] yep
[1:19:08] okay we'll see what we can do
[1:19:11] and they give me sundays off
[1:19:13] then down the road
[1:19:16] there was a charter from
[1:19:19] denmark
[1:19:21] and they were
[1:19:22] dropping off people on sundays afternoon
[1:19:24] so after church i went to the airport
[1:19:27] picked them up put on the taxi and
[1:19:29] bye bye
[1:19:31] so i worked there until
[1:19:34] 2000. year two thousand
[1:19:39] and
[1:19:40] you know
[1:19:42] and back in my mind still i was looking
[1:19:45] for
[1:19:47] my help me
[1:19:50] and
[1:19:52] i couldn't find her anywhere
[1:19:54] and when we grow older
[1:19:56] we become more picky
[1:20:00] because
[1:20:01] when you're when we're young oh she's
[1:20:04] beautiful and she
[1:20:06] when she smile has this dimples and and
[1:20:10] and we just go by the looks
[1:20:13] but when we start growing older and we
[1:20:15] know that we also eat
[1:20:20] we start looking for someone that
[1:20:22] if she doesn't know how to cook at least
[1:20:24] she's willing to learn
[1:20:28] so so i brought a couple
[1:20:30] candidates to my house and
[1:20:33] say mom
[1:20:35] here is so-and-so
[1:20:39] and if she didn't
[1:20:40] put any input to help my mom and i said
[1:20:48] okay
[1:20:53] so
[1:20:55] but i still knew that
[1:20:58] somehow god was gonna give me
[1:21:01] what i was looking for even though i
[1:21:03] didn't know what i was looking for
[1:21:07] because
[1:21:08] that's true we don't we don't know
[1:21:11] and i'm gonna prove you in a minute if
[1:21:14] you don't believe me
[1:21:17] so
[1:21:19] i um
[1:21:21] i always
[1:21:24] again it's god's grace
[1:21:26] i always had in my heart
[1:21:29] to find someone
[1:21:32] that
[1:21:32] god will approve
[1:21:36] i didn't know how i was going to find
[1:21:38] out that
[1:21:40] but i just knew
[1:21:43] that somehow god was gonna
[1:21:46] put the pieces in place so that happened
[1:21:51] so uh
[1:21:54] i
[1:21:57] came to the states in 2000
[1:21:59] august 18.
[1:22:03] and
[1:22:05] the first thing is my dream
[1:22:07] since i was since i started listening
[1:22:10] brother bernie
[1:22:11] bernie's tapes
[1:22:13] since i was a kid
[1:22:14] so my dream was
[1:22:17] to
[1:22:18] be able to be in tavern a phoenix
[1:22:20] tabernacle one day
[1:22:22] and and and
[1:22:24] i met the brother in in mexico he went
[1:22:27] there but
[1:22:28] i just wanted to be in the place
[1:22:31] where
[1:22:32] he was preaching all these sermons
[1:22:35] and you know we
[1:22:37] we
[1:22:38] we go to church
[1:22:40] um i'm gonna back up a little bit when
[1:22:43] we're a kid when we're kids we go to
[1:22:45] church because our parents take us to
[1:22:46] church
[1:22:49] but
[1:22:50] coming to church with your parents
[1:22:53] doesn't make you a christian
[1:22:57] coming to church
[1:23:01] is something that you
[1:23:03] want to
[1:23:05] right that you can't wait till
[1:23:08] sunday morning the doors open to come
[1:23:11] and meet with god
[1:23:13] you're not you're not you're not coming
[1:23:15] here
[1:23:16] to see
[1:23:17] someone
[1:23:19] to have a meeting with some
[1:23:21] you you're here because you want to hear
[1:23:23] from the lord
[1:23:24] and you want to grow
[1:23:26] spiritually
[1:23:28] so you can be
[1:23:29] stronger and stronger every day
[1:23:32] because the moment we stop
[1:23:34] eating
[1:23:35] from the
[1:23:37] heavenly manner
[1:23:39] we get weaker and weaker
[1:23:41] and that's where where the enemy once
[1:23:44] wants us to do
[1:23:45] that's why he came up with all these
[1:23:47] devices so he can
[1:23:51] pull us
[1:23:52] this way and that way and then
[1:23:55] he's smart
[1:23:57] but we have to outsmart him
[1:23:59] by sticking with the world because
[1:24:02] before those devices
[1:24:05] in the beginning was the word right
[1:24:09] so
[1:24:09] we have to stick with the what was
[1:24:11] spoken in the beginning
[1:24:14] and and uh because everything here i
[1:24:17] mean you got a cell phone we got i got a
[1:24:20] cell phone but you know what after a
[1:24:21] year the cell phone start having
[1:24:23] problems
[1:24:25] it's a device made by men
[1:24:27] that has an expiration date but the son
[1:24:30] of god
[1:24:32] doesn't have an expiration date
[1:24:35] because the seed of god is in his
[1:24:38] children
[1:24:39] and that's what is eternal
[1:24:41] that's what brother burns says
[1:24:44] hell is not eternal because or people
[1:24:48] in hell there won't have eternal life
[1:24:50] there
[1:24:52] because that was created
[1:24:55] but god has no beginning has no end
[1:24:59] and we
[1:25:01] were created
[1:25:02] at his image
[1:25:05] amen then
[1:25:08] so
[1:25:10] when i made my decision by being a
[1:25:13] christian
[1:25:15] i was at the age of 15.
[1:25:18] i decided to baptize
[1:25:20] and i said from now on it's on me
[1:25:24] from now on
[1:25:26] my parents responsibility
[1:25:28] is over
[1:25:30] so i have to fight the fight but i'm
[1:25:33] just myself
[1:25:35] but i can i can feel my mom's prayers
[1:25:38] all the time even though i'm married
[1:25:42] i know
[1:25:43] she never sees praying for
[1:25:46] her nine
[1:25:49] nine children and now she has to pray
[1:25:51] for the grandchildren
[1:25:52] too and
[1:25:55] you know
[1:25:56] i had this
[1:25:58] uh perspective of
[1:26:01] oh i uh
[1:26:02] i'm gonna go to the phoenix tabernacle
[1:26:05] and
[1:26:06] i'm pretty sure i'm gonna find
[1:26:08] my help me there because it's a
[1:26:10] christian church
[1:26:15] what a surprise
[1:26:19] again i'm not saying i was a perfect
[1:26:21] christian
[1:26:22] but when i got there
[1:26:25] i went back to colorado you know
[1:26:27] listen
[1:26:28] i didn't have a car i like i said i got
[1:26:31] i i got here to the states
[1:26:34] of course you know that no money
[1:26:37] uh i had a friend
[1:26:39] in colorado
[1:26:41] that he had a
[1:26:45] 85 toyota tercel
[1:26:47] 4x4 i don't know if
[1:26:49] anyone knows those cars but
[1:26:53] uh that car
[1:26:55] he said you know what i use this car
[1:26:57] shoes for work back and forth but i
[1:26:59] never took any
[1:27:00] long trips you want to take it
[1:27:02] is there
[1:27:04] okay how much you wanna are you gonna
[1:27:06] run how much you want no just take it
[1:27:11] i was
[1:27:12] i i was living in
[1:27:15] close to aspen colorado
[1:27:19] so i drove
[1:27:21] no english no money
[1:27:23] in a borough card
[1:27:25] i was
[1:27:27] happy to go to phoenix tabernacle
[1:27:31] because that was my dream
[1:27:34] so
[1:27:37] i drove from colorado
[1:27:39] uh utah
[1:27:41] and arizona and there is a place called
[1:27:44] kayenta never forget that
[1:27:48] you know
[1:27:49] yeah you know why
[1:27:51] because and that kayenta town was a
[1:27:53] construction area
[1:27:56] and it was it was
[1:27:59] november
[1:28:01] it wasn't that hot
[1:28:03] but
[1:28:05] like i said i didn't speak any english
[1:28:08] and
[1:28:10] i was driving with a mexican driver's
[1:28:12] license
[1:28:14] so i was nervous
[1:28:16] every time i saw a patrol car i was like
[1:28:18] oh don't stop don't just don't stop just
[1:28:21] keep going keep going
[1:28:22] i was praying
[1:28:24] so
[1:28:26] then i i had to stop in this
[1:28:28] construction area
[1:28:30] and the temperature gauge started going
[1:28:32] [Music]
[1:28:33] while i was waiting
[1:28:35] and it went hot
[1:28:38] and i couldn't do an earth construction
[1:28:40] area
[1:28:42] is there is no way that i can turn i can
[1:28:45] get off the road
[1:28:47] all i all i did was lord
[1:28:50] you know the purpose of this trip
[1:28:52] i don't know what's going on with this
[1:28:53] car
[1:28:56] i just can't trust you
[1:29:01] when i open my eyes
[1:29:03] the two impact normal
[1:29:08] god's grace
[1:29:11] i uh made it made it to phoenix
[1:29:15] the first thing i did was
[1:29:17] go to a mechanic and see check the car
[1:29:21] they couldn't find anything wrong with
[1:29:22] it
[1:29:24] i drove in phoenix it's
[1:29:26] what i had to drive and
[1:29:29] went back
[1:29:30] no issues
[1:29:32] with the car
[1:29:34] but i realized that that my helmet
[1:29:37] wasn't there
[1:29:40] yeah
[1:29:41] what a deception right as a christian
[1:29:43] church
[1:29:46] but you know
[1:29:48] i went back
[1:29:50] this is 2000.
[1:29:53] 2001 came the meetings again
[1:29:56] i'm gonna give another chance um
[1:29:59] went back again
[1:30:00] on a different car
[1:30:05] i went back
[1:30:07] and
[1:30:09] i came back to work
[1:30:10] empty-handed
[1:30:13] so i just
[1:30:14] like i say i always remember
[1:30:18] god i don't know what's going on
[1:30:22] but you know
[1:30:26] that what i'm looking for
[1:30:29] so i
[1:30:32] you know what since i never had any luck
[1:30:35] with the dads of the daughters
[1:30:38] that i dated mexico they didn't like me
[1:30:39] i don't know why
[1:30:44] uh
[1:30:45] i said lord
[1:30:48] this is what i'm gonna do now
[1:30:50] i wanna because i i don't wanna hit and
[1:30:53] miss
[1:30:54] anymore
[1:30:57] i know
[1:30:58] you create me
[1:31:00] i'm sorry i know you create me
[1:31:04] and i know
[1:31:06] who
[1:31:07] you have
[1:31:08] for me
[1:31:11] so i'm gonna ask you
[1:31:13] for three signs
[1:31:17] number one said
[1:31:19] i'm your son
[1:31:21] maybe not the best looking guy but
[1:31:23] i'm still your son
[1:31:26] i say from now on
[1:31:28] i don't think the son of god has to beg
[1:31:30] for love
[1:31:34] and i might be wrong
[1:31:36] but that was my talk with god
[1:31:40] i say
[1:31:42] the first sign that i want to know is
[1:31:43] that
[1:31:44] when i approach someone again
[1:31:49] i wanna
[1:31:51] i wanna know that it's you
[1:31:55] in that
[1:31:56] person
[1:31:59] when
[1:32:00] when i ask
[1:32:04] so
[1:32:04] i don't want to finish my sentence when
[1:32:06] she say yes
[1:32:08] i say it's too much to ask
[1:32:13] well the second is
[1:32:15] the dad
[1:32:16] must like me this time
[1:32:22] so
[1:32:24] because i mean uh i wasn't doing nothing
[1:32:27] wrong
[1:32:28] was i
[1:32:30] and if
[1:32:31] i just
[1:32:32] i think that the the biggest problem
[1:32:34] that i had was because i didn't have no
[1:32:36] money
[1:32:36] i didn't have a house
[1:32:41] maybe
[1:32:44] but anyhow is is uh
[1:32:48] that's that's one of the reasons the
[1:32:50] young people make mistakes
[1:32:53] because
[1:32:55] sometimes
[1:32:59] at least i had that experience
[1:33:02] we as we as young people we look up to
[1:33:06] ministers and because
[1:33:09] this minister always is
[1:33:13] as an awesome minister behind the pulpit
[1:33:16] he jumps and shouts and dies
[1:33:19] but you know what
[1:33:21] i realized that
[1:33:22] you don't know
[1:33:23] someone behind the pulpit is good person
[1:33:27] when you don't know him
[1:33:29] outside
[1:33:30] that's right
[1:33:32] and that's what i thought
[1:33:33] i had to tell something
[1:33:36] a little bit of my background to people
[1:33:39] because
[1:33:41] i don't want you to have a
[1:33:44] form of me that oh i'm a servant of the
[1:33:46] lord because i come here and speak and
[1:33:48] brother paul calls me back again and
[1:33:51] no because i want you to know me a
[1:33:52] little bit more
[1:33:56] because
[1:33:59] choose myself i'm a big mess
[1:34:02] without the lord
[1:34:05] so
[1:34:07] then i
[1:34:10] i
[1:34:14] forgot to ask one thing to the lord
[1:34:17] not those conditions
[1:34:20] i didn't ask him
[1:34:22] to be close to me
[1:34:25] i miss it
[1:34:27] totally amazing
[1:34:29] so when i was in colorado
[1:34:32] at work
[1:34:34] i met a girl
[1:34:36] and
[1:34:37] feed some of the
[1:34:39] requirements that i asked the lord
[1:34:42] but she had she was
[1:34:45] she won she was with second
[1:34:49] marriage or
[1:34:51] divorce
[1:34:53] and
[1:34:54] all the time i always
[1:34:56] present lord
[1:34:57] whoever i
[1:34:58] was
[1:35:00] talking to
[1:35:01] i always present the lord
[1:35:04] and if they i say lord if they fall in
[1:35:06] love with you
[1:35:07] then that might be one of the
[1:35:10] chances that i can befall
[1:35:12] in love with her but if she doesn't want
[1:35:15] anything to do with you then i don't
[1:35:17] want anything to do with her
[1:35:20] i always had that in my heart
[1:35:23] and i it's not that i felt like i was
[1:35:25] more special than anyone it's just
[1:35:27] i feel like
[1:35:28] god
[1:35:30] i didn't ask to be here
[1:35:32] in this earth
[1:35:34] so you for some reason you
[1:35:37] you
[1:35:38] decide that i was gonna be here and for
[1:35:42] that reason
[1:35:43] i know i need a helmet
[1:35:46] but you know where it is i don't know
[1:35:50] so
[1:35:52] two more minutes
[1:35:55] uh so i uh
[1:36:00] i thought she was
[1:36:01] the winner
[1:36:04] so when i uh but i always
[1:36:08] uh call
[1:36:09] brother bernie at that time
[1:36:13] and uh
[1:36:15] and i called brother bernie and and
[1:36:18] and he said
[1:36:20] you're gonna hear a lot of vices
[1:36:23] but decision is yours
[1:36:26] you have to make a decision
[1:36:29] if you asking me
[1:36:30] for my advice
[1:36:32] is this
[1:36:34] don't go there don't go that way
[1:36:38] because you're gonna ruin your ministry
[1:36:44] i say what are you talking about i don't
[1:36:46] even know if i'm a minister
[1:36:49] but you know what i listen
[1:36:53] and uh
[1:36:56] oh the other sign that i asked i almost
[1:36:59] missed that one
[1:37:01] that i didn't want anybody that was
[1:37:02] jealous
[1:37:05] if she doesn't trust me that means
[1:37:08] so this girl that i met
[1:37:12] in colorado
[1:37:13] like i say seems like fit the
[1:37:16] requirements
[1:37:18] but she was possessive and jealous
[1:37:22] so when brother bernie told me
[1:37:24] not to
[1:37:27] before i was doubting
[1:37:29] but when i
[1:37:31] saw that she was possessive and jealous
[1:37:33] say
[1:37:34] no
[1:37:36] then i went back to god again and said
[1:37:37] lord what's going on
[1:37:41] i'm your child i know i'm your child and
[1:37:44] i know you have someone out there for me
[1:37:47] but what is it
[1:37:50] but but this time i'm 27 now
[1:37:53] and there my plans were to be married by
[1:37:55] 20 right
[1:37:58] i was like jacob i feel like jacob
[1:38:00] working seven years
[1:38:06] so
[1:38:08] then i uh we started working in the
[1:38:10] mission in greeley with brother ezekiel
[1:38:13] and then one day i i was traveling from
[1:38:16] aspen four hours
[1:38:17] winter and summer like for three years
[1:38:20] two years somewhere
[1:38:22] every every weekend
[1:38:24] to to help with that mission there
[1:38:27] and
[1:38:28] my co-workers say hey you have a
[1:38:30] girlfriend over there that's where you
[1:38:31] go every weekend over there yeah i have
[1:38:32] one
[1:38:34] they didn't understand anyway so
[1:38:36] yeah i have one
[1:38:38] so
[1:38:39] one of these trips
[1:38:41] uh i got into the bedroom that i had
[1:38:43] there for
[1:38:44] i said i saw an album photo album you
[1:38:48] kids you know what the photo album is
[1:38:51] nowadays so digital right
[1:38:55] so
[1:38:55] i started flipping peaches
[1:38:58] and then
[1:39:00] i saw a beautiful lady there
[1:39:04] and she looked like a girl i mean
[1:39:07] still still a girl
[1:39:10] but you know what something inside of me
[1:39:13] jump out that's what you're looking for
[1:39:17] and i had no doubt about it
[1:39:21] that when i walked out of the i
[1:39:24] i got out of that room
[1:39:27] and i went to brother execute say who is
[1:39:29] this
[1:39:30] girl here
[1:39:32] i want you to tell me about her
[1:39:34] she goes like
[1:39:38] you want to talk to her
[1:39:40] say yeah why not she's beautiful
[1:39:45] okay she's from peru
[1:39:48] what
[1:39:52] okay
[1:39:54] so there
[1:39:56] she uh he gave me her
[1:39:58] email address
[1:40:00] kermit if i'm wrong right
[1:40:04] so
[1:40:05] i sent her an
[1:40:07] a an email
[1:40:09] i don't remember what i told her but
[1:40:12] i remember when she said hi back
[1:40:18] i said oh she speak english
[1:40:24] so we start
[1:40:26] emailing back and forth and i asked her
[1:40:28] for her phone number
[1:40:30] like the second email that i sent her
[1:40:34] and he told me he was she was from the
[1:40:37] capital of lima so i said she must have
[1:40:40] a phone
[1:40:42] number
[1:40:44] so she gave it to me
[1:40:48] and then i called brother bernie
[1:40:53] brother bernie
[1:40:55] what do you think i found
[1:40:57] this girl and then i told her
[1:41:01] and uh
[1:41:02] oh that's good
[1:41:05] but
[1:41:06] before i found that picture
[1:41:09] many tears i had to share
[1:41:15] because i was going back with god
[1:41:18] pretty much every day
[1:41:19] what i'm doing wrong
[1:41:23] before that
[1:41:25] i want to back up again
[1:41:28] before i found the picture
[1:41:32] i was so
[1:41:36] i want to say desperate
[1:41:38] i was desperate and and
[1:41:40] kind of mad with god i said you know
[1:41:42] what lord i've been doing
[1:41:44] the best i can because because that's
[1:41:47] the human being right we we do
[1:41:49] good a little bit and we say oh we're
[1:41:51] doing great
[1:41:53] but in the measurement of god
[1:41:56] that's not good enough
[1:41:57] that's when grace kicks in
[1:42:00] to
[1:42:01] finish the work
[1:42:04] and then
[1:42:07] i have friends
[1:42:09] in aspen there is a tourist place
[1:42:12] that a lot of kids
[1:42:14] coming to graduate and
[1:42:16] finalize their school
[1:42:19] practicing with customer service and
[1:42:21] whatever so
[1:42:22] there were girls from
[1:42:25] brazil
[1:42:26] new zealand
[1:42:28] different parts of the world
[1:42:30] and
[1:42:31] they were inviting me to go to a
[1:42:33] bar
[1:42:35] friday nights
[1:42:36] oh it is
[1:42:37] two for one or whatever i don't know
[1:42:39] what it is
[1:42:41] and
[1:42:42] and they invite me every pretty much
[1:42:44] every week and i said nope i gotta go
[1:42:46] home
[1:42:48] i never went but you know i got to this
[1:42:49] point when i was really upset and i said
[1:42:52] you know lord
[1:42:54] i don't think you need me
[1:42:56] i don't think you
[1:42:58] you want anything with me
[1:43:01] so i'm done
[1:43:02] so next time i got invite
[1:43:04] i'm gonna go
[1:43:06] this is me talking like monday or
[1:43:08] tuesday
[1:43:10] well guess what thursday night
[1:43:14] i was working
[1:43:17] and
[1:43:19] i went
[1:43:21] i had my cell phone with me but it was
[1:43:23] off so at my
[1:43:26] dinner time supper
[1:43:28] i
[1:43:29] opened
[1:43:31] the phone and there was a voicemail
[1:43:35] area code
[1:43:36] 602. number that i wasn't registered to
[1:43:39] my phone
[1:43:41] and
[1:43:43] the call
[1:43:46] was proper party
[1:43:54] i'm sorry i can't help it but
[1:43:56] god's great again
[1:44:02] because
[1:44:05] the conversation i had with god
[1:44:09] i didn't answer the phone it was a
[1:44:11] voicemail
[1:44:12] yeah
[1:44:13] i opened the voicemail
[1:44:15] bro bernie says
[1:44:17] son
[1:44:18] i'm just calling to say that i love you
[1:44:23] i know what you're going through
[1:44:25] and it's hard
[1:44:27] but god god loves you too
[1:44:32] and he
[1:44:33] wants you to know
[1:44:36] that you're not alone
[1:44:41] i miss dinner that night i just went up
[1:44:43] cry
[1:44:48] am i
[1:44:51] who am i so he can have more mercy with
[1:44:53] me than some other people
[1:44:56] how many times you talk to people and
[1:44:58] they don't want at least they think
[1:44:59] you're you're given something of yours
[1:45:03] but we've got nothing to offer
[1:45:07] i mean the salvation comes from the lord
[1:45:09] it doesn't come from grace tabernacle
[1:45:12] or any minister to come speak here
[1:45:16] that's god's grace
[1:45:19] it's the same grace for you is the same
[1:45:21] grace for me
[1:45:25] so i hadn't
[1:45:27] i didn't do anything
[1:45:29] extra
[1:45:30] so he can
[1:45:32] be merciful with me
[1:45:35] but i i again i i always i will
[1:45:39] i don't know how about i always knew
[1:45:41] that
[1:45:42] god had a plan for me
[1:45:45] and i didn't want to mess up his plan
[1:45:49] so every time
[1:45:50] that i wanted to
[1:45:52] to do something wrong i
[1:45:54] the first thing i had in mind say
[1:45:57] i'm going to hurt my mom
[1:46:01] she's been praying for me
[1:46:04] hold this years
[1:46:07] and then what about god
[1:46:10] i don't know why his plan is with me but
[1:46:13] he has a plan for my life
[1:46:15] and i don't want to mess up that either
[1:46:20] so uh
[1:46:22] after i i i listened um voicemail
[1:46:28] guess what
[1:46:30] no one else
[1:46:31] invite me again
[1:46:37] yeah
[1:46:38] so that's when i
[1:46:41] found her on the
[1:46:44] photo album
[1:46:46] and we started dating
[1:46:48] over the phone and
[1:46:50] you want to call it dating
[1:46:52] emails phones phone calls
[1:46:55] i use a lot of phone cards back then
[1:47:00] but you know what after a year
[1:47:03] not even a year when i asked her
[1:47:05] she didn't let me
[1:47:06] finish i said laura
[1:47:10] thank you laura
[1:47:13] and then
[1:47:14] later i found out that
[1:47:17] even even her grandma loved me
[1:47:23] yeah
[1:47:26] i uh
[1:47:27] and i think i win her because
[1:47:30] i sent her mariachi to her window one
[1:47:32] time
[1:47:36] and
[1:47:37] and uh
[1:47:38] she said that
[1:47:40] her grandma said
[1:47:42] that
[1:47:44] anyone like jose
[1:47:47] that's the one
[1:47:50] i will have problems with anyone else
[1:47:52] here in lima
[1:47:54] but with him even though she's go i know
[1:47:56] she's gonna live far away
[1:47:59] i have no problems
[1:48:01] so
[1:48:02] god's grace again
[1:48:05] but
[1:48:07] we didn't see each other
[1:48:11] uh
[1:48:12] pictures only
[1:48:14] i called brother bernie says it's been a
[1:48:17] year what do you think
[1:48:19] hold on one more year that's right
[1:48:23] and
[1:48:25] after talking to him like
[1:48:28] the following week
[1:48:29] i was diagnosed with something going on
[1:48:32] in my intestine
[1:48:35] that i needed surgery
[1:48:38] and
[1:48:41] it wasn't 2006
[1:48:44] so i went and did the
[1:48:46] scans and everything and
[1:48:48] went to work i was
[1:48:51] get started at work when i got a phone
[1:48:53] call said you need to come back you need
[1:48:54] we need to do surgery
[1:48:57] and uh
[1:48:59] i i went back and on my way back to the
[1:49:02] hospital i called the brother execute
[1:49:05] i want you to pray for me i don't want
[1:49:06] to get caught nothing
[1:49:08] i want to god handle this
[1:49:10] so
[1:49:12] they run three more
[1:49:13] exams
[1:49:14] the next next day came to me and said
[1:49:17] i'm so sorry we scare you and but we
[1:49:20] found something that
[1:49:21] was really risky
[1:49:23] i say don't worry i know what happened
[1:49:27] god's grace one more time
[1:49:31] yeah so uh
[1:49:33] then
[1:49:36] we kept
[1:49:37] exchanging
[1:49:39] information back and forth until uh
[1:49:45] we decided that we was gonna get married
[1:49:46] in 2007
[1:49:49] and we
[1:49:50] didn't know each other
[1:49:52] face to face
[1:49:54] two weeks before the wedding
[1:49:58] now
[1:49:59] i'm not encouraging young kids to do the
[1:50:02] same
[1:50:04] okay
[1:50:07] don't do that
[1:50:11] i don't regret it
[1:50:13] but
[1:50:16] it's painful
[1:50:18] because
[1:50:20] you have to go through
[1:50:22] a lot of things in life
[1:50:25] that you might don't like it
[1:50:28] like i say when you are obedient to the
[1:50:30] lord
[1:50:32] he's gonna pay you double
[1:50:35] give you back
[1:50:37] double
[1:50:38] so
[1:50:40] don't think because
[1:50:43] you are 18
[1:50:45] and 19
[1:50:46] 21 25 you're getting too old
[1:50:49] god's plans are perfect
[1:50:53] the
[1:50:56] bad thing i saw on the ministers back
[1:50:58] then is that
[1:51:00] many ministers were pushing
[1:51:04] young
[1:51:04] people oh you're 20 you're getting old
[1:51:07] why are you going to get married
[1:51:11] because they got married when they were
[1:51:12] 17
[1:51:15] no
[1:51:18] i mean
[1:51:19] i i i have the best wife that i could
[1:51:22] ever found
[1:51:24] and i don't think i found her
[1:51:26] god
[1:51:26] put it there for me
[1:51:28] i mean when i was making plans in
[1:51:30] marriage she was like seven years old
[1:51:35] eight maybe
[1:51:39] who would knew
[1:51:43] imagine if i called her dad hey i made
[1:51:45] it in preparation for
[1:51:47] to marry your daughter
[1:51:51] if i was there he'd probably shoot me
[1:51:56] but you know what again
[1:51:57] it's god's grace
[1:52:00] i like i told you in the beginning
[1:52:05] i wasn't
[1:52:06] i wasn't going to bring you a
[1:52:08] a good teaching maybe but
[1:52:11] i want you to know
[1:52:13] a little bit more about us
[1:52:16] we're
[1:52:17] we're not perfect but you know what i'm
[1:52:19] just want to share this experience with
[1:52:22] with you and especially with the younger
[1:52:25] kids
[1:52:26] because
[1:52:27] i is is is now how fast you can make a
[1:52:31] decision to get married
[1:52:32] it's not about that
[1:52:35] it is how much you love the lord first
[1:52:40] seek first the kingdom of god
[1:52:44] and then he's going to add
[1:52:47] whatever we need
[1:52:49] you know
[1:52:50] i always
[1:52:52] give this example
[1:52:55] when
[1:52:56] a guy was having problems with his
[1:52:59] car in the middle of the road
[1:53:02] a well-dressed
[1:53:04] man showed up and said
[1:53:06] kid
[1:53:07] what's going on
[1:53:08] can i help you
[1:53:10] and he said wow what can you do you
[1:53:13] don't look like a mechanic
[1:53:17] maybe not but what what's going on
[1:53:20] well
[1:53:22] this
[1:53:23] car doesn't doesn't want to start
[1:53:27] okay pop the hood
[1:53:29] and he went in there and
[1:53:31] moved a screw or two
[1:53:32] try it again yeah and the car start
[1:53:36] it was the guy who designed the car
[1:53:40] god designed you
[1:53:43] he knows what you need
[1:53:45] so don't run
[1:53:47] don't rush that's right
[1:53:49] because that's the problem
[1:53:52] we rush things
[1:53:54] and then we come back
[1:53:56] paying the price
[1:53:59] like brother bernie told me
[1:54:02] there will be many advices
[1:54:06] but the decision is going to be yours
[1:54:08] and you're going to have to be prepared
[1:54:10] to live
[1:54:11] with the results of the decision you
[1:54:14] make
[1:54:16] you make a right decision
[1:54:21] you make the wrong decision
[1:54:23] you're gonna have to live with it
[1:54:25] there is no way you can
[1:54:26] skip that
[1:54:28] if i
[1:54:30] just because i was feeling too old and i
[1:54:33] decided to go with
[1:54:34] the one i thought was feeding the
[1:54:36] requirements
[1:54:39] i don't know what i would be today
[1:54:42] for sure i wouldn't be stunning this
[1:54:44] place
[1:54:45] i can guarantee you that
[1:54:48] you know what in 2002 i drove by here
[1:54:53] i went to
[1:54:55] washington to visit my brother and then
[1:54:57] we drove back here to went to murphy
[1:55:00] church up there
[1:55:02] and i didn't know there was a grace
[1:55:04] tabernacle here
[1:55:06] but you know what
[1:55:08] i
[1:55:09] like i say i don't recommend doing what
[1:55:11] i did
[1:55:12] i don't regret it because
[1:55:16] she's more than i could have asked for
[1:55:21] and
[1:55:22] on my way here i
[1:55:25] i asked i told her say hey
[1:55:28] when can we go to climb ohio to visit
[1:55:30] barchat
[1:55:32] just tell me when
[1:55:34] i'm ready
[1:55:37] so
[1:55:38] if you if you think
[1:55:41] that
[1:55:42] getting married with someone that
[1:55:44] because
[1:55:46] he's handsome or she's beautiful and
[1:55:49] i mean all that is going to go away
[1:55:54] you know i was just joking with my son
[1:55:57] the other day and i said bro uh joe what
[1:56:00] are you gonna
[1:56:01] who are you gonna look for
[1:56:05] uh
[1:56:07] brown white or mexican peruvian
[1:56:10] he said that
[1:56:12] whoever has a good heart i say praise
[1:56:15] the lord
[1:56:16] i mean
[1:56:18] we're we're not about colors we're about
[1:56:20] character right
[1:56:22] because
[1:56:25] all that matters
[1:56:26] is that
[1:56:28] what is in you
[1:56:31] can find connection what is in the other
[1:56:32] part
[1:56:34] and that
[1:56:36] that's when god is working
[1:56:39] when you love the lord she loves the
[1:56:41] lord
[1:56:42] we're going to have
[1:56:45] some bumps on the road
[1:56:47] tell me about it
[1:56:48] but you know what we have
[1:56:51] the help
[1:56:52] of the holy ghost
[1:56:54] to come and help us that's right
[1:56:56] you know
[1:56:59] the bible says
[1:57:01] that
[1:57:03] eve
[1:57:04] was
[1:57:05] taken out from
[1:57:07] adam's
[1:57:09] body
[1:57:12] and
[1:57:13] she's in the bible says that
[1:57:16] was part of her body
[1:57:19] and you know what
[1:57:20] and i
[1:57:23] i'm not very proud to say this but
[1:57:26] when i made her cry
[1:57:30] before
[1:57:32] i don't remember what was last time
[1:57:34] thank god because i'm watching up
[1:57:38] but when i made her cry i realized that
[1:57:41] i was hurting myself
[1:57:44] and i couldn't wait till next day
[1:57:47] to go say i'm sorry honey
[1:57:52] even though
[1:57:53] i felt i had
[1:57:55] i was right
[1:57:57] but you know what i said
[1:57:59] i'm sorry amen yeah please forgive me
[1:58:02] amen
[1:58:06] and and she's part of us
[1:58:08] and i can't imagine my life without her
[1:58:10] honestly
[1:58:12] and i'm not saying this because she's
[1:58:13] back there
[1:58:16] it is because
[1:58:18] uh
[1:58:20] lately i realized
[1:58:23] that if it wasn't for her
[1:58:26] i couldn't be where i'm at that's
[1:58:27] exactly right
[1:58:30] yeah
[1:58:31] that's the truth because
[1:58:34] that's when god
[1:58:36] i have no doubt
[1:58:38] zero doubt
[1:58:40] that that's the one god had for me
[1:58:45] because in my line of work
[1:58:47] i have to deal with the wives
[1:58:50] 99 of the time
[1:58:53] and she's not worried
[1:58:55] she's not jealous
[1:58:57] she's not checking me
[1:58:59] where are you what time are you coming
[1:59:04] that's a team teamwork
[1:59:07] she's home taking care of the kids
[1:59:09] god's grace
[1:59:11] we're homeschooling
[1:59:15] what did i do
[1:59:17] god's grace
[1:59:21] again i i i'm sorry if i let you down
[1:59:25] today because it wasn't a good
[1:59:27] i
[1:59:30] but i think
[1:59:33] i think i can be a help with someone
[1:59:35] maybe maybe not here but someone out in
[1:59:37] the internet
[1:59:39] is because
[1:59:41] we we have to make sure that whatever
[1:59:43] we're doing here
[1:59:45] we have to be doing for the lord
[1:59:48] because this young lady is here
[1:59:53] if lord teres
[1:59:55] they're gonna be the wife of someone
[1:59:58] and we as parents
[2:00:02] we would love to see them married to a
[2:00:05] servant of the lord
[2:00:06] but it is not a servant up here only
[2:00:10] because a true servant of the lord
[2:00:13] starts in the house
[2:00:16] and they're home
[2:00:18] because we you know
[2:00:20] many times and i'm gonna say this
[2:00:24] with a little bit of pride but the good
[2:00:27] pride
[2:00:28] i hope it doesn't don't misunderstand me
[2:00:31] but
[2:00:33] many times when i come out uh
[2:00:36] finished preaching
[2:00:38] either one of my kids say
[2:00:40] dad you preach very well today
[2:00:43] i enjoy what you preach today
[2:00:46] that is telling me that
[2:00:48] i'm not doing a bad job at home
[2:00:50] because
[2:00:52] i can be
[2:00:53] a monster at my house and i can be a
[2:00:56] saint here
[2:01:00] and that's what i'm trying to take care
[2:01:01] of
[2:01:02] or watch out not to do that because it's
[2:01:04] really easy to the the ego can pop up
[2:01:08] because one person comes and tell us oh
[2:01:11] how
[2:01:13] so it's just it's my prayer all the time
[2:01:15] lord don't let me be that kind of person
[2:01:19] and again it's god's grace
[2:01:22] that is brought us this far
[2:01:26] again i'm sorry if i took too much time
[2:01:30] but uh
[2:01:31] i just want you to to know that
[2:01:35] we have struggled the same as you
[2:01:38] but you know what we serve in the same
[2:01:39] lore
[2:01:41] and is the same god if you please stand
[2:02:03] brother jason if you just come
[2:02:08] let's pray
[2:02:10] heavenly father we thank you lord

[2:02:25] the goodness of you lord

[2:07:21] amen wasn't that beautiful this morning
[2:07:24] you know sometimes when we come and we
[2:07:26] think okay we're going to hear
[2:07:27] somebody's testimony
[2:07:30] but isn't amazing
[2:07:32] there's so much of his testimony that
[2:07:34] i'm like
[2:07:35] there was i lord
[2:07:37] oh here lord you did the same for me and
[2:07:39] thank you lord and it just
[2:07:42] amen
[2:07:43] brother jose i hope you don't mind i'm
[2:07:45] going to change the title of your sermon
[2:07:47] today
[2:07:47] [Music]
[2:07:49] i was thinking as he was speaking it
[2:07:51] god leads his dear children along
[2:07:55] and that is the story of every one of us
[2:07:57] our lives
[2:07:59] we can look back and say you know what i
[2:08:02] would have done this
[2:08:04] but the lord led me here
[2:08:06] i would have made a mistake that would
[2:08:08] have been life-changing
[2:08:11] but the lord put a red light in front of
[2:08:13] me and
[2:08:14] stopped me for long enough and
[2:08:18] phone would ring voicemail
[2:08:22] and suddenly you realize you know
[2:08:23] there's a little girl i don't know if
[2:08:24] you've heard it on youtube i can't think
[2:08:26] of her name i think it's haley cross
[2:08:29] saying this
[2:08:31] brother tim pruitt's church down there
[2:08:33] direct line to the throne room
[2:08:36] if you haven't listened to that song
[2:08:38] it's a very inspiring song to me you can
[2:08:41] find it online
[2:08:42] my brother and sister we have
[2:08:44] a direct line
[2:08:47] to the throne room
[2:08:49] we don't have to say well i hope somehow
[2:08:51] god hears me
[2:08:53] what we have to do is just get sincere
[2:08:57] and then have the confidence to know
[2:08:59] that god has hurt us amen now look i
[2:09:01] just have a couple little things i don't
[2:09:03] want to re-preach his sermon for him but
[2:09:05] you know i happen to know sister sefi
[2:09:09] and
[2:09:11] i happen to know most of that story
[2:09:14] from our friendship
[2:09:17] but is it beautiful and i i give you a
[2:09:19] rose today sister cephei and i give a
[2:09:21] rose to my dear sisters
[2:09:23] you see by god's grace
[2:09:25] the beauty we see in our sisters is the
[2:09:27] beauty that christ saw in his bride and
[2:09:30] that the beauty is on the inside amen
[2:09:33] it's not how we dress up the outside but
[2:09:36] the beauty is on the inside
[2:09:39] amen god bless you sister cephei
[2:09:41] if i can say this correctly i love you
[2:09:43] very much
[2:09:46] amen now look i want to just make this
[2:09:48] other comment right here
[2:09:50] you see to truly find what you're
[2:09:52] looking for
[2:09:53] [Music]
[2:09:55] you must turn down the things
[2:09:57] that are not for you
[2:10:00] see satan's going to offer
[2:10:02] as time goes on this bride of jesus
[2:10:05] christ
[2:10:06] the devil's offering her all kinds of
[2:10:08] things
[2:10:09] [Music]
[2:10:10] and the real decision is is
[2:10:14] will i accept it or do i turn it down
[2:10:16] we've heard
[2:10:18] a brother jose's testimony today
[2:10:21] another lady seemed to fit most of the
[2:10:24] criteria most did you catch that most
[2:10:29] but i can tell you this morning this
[2:10:31] bride of jesus christ
[2:10:34] she's not just fitting most of the
[2:10:36] criteria
[2:10:38] she
[2:10:39] is the perfect example of the criteria
[2:10:43] of jesus christ
[2:10:45] she didn't say i'll read the book and
[2:10:47] become what he wants me to be
[2:10:50] you know that
[2:10:51] sometimes we think about that as a
[2:10:53] christian oh i need to do this but you
[2:10:55] see there's a difference of becoming
[2:10:57] what he wants it to be or
[2:11:00] it just naturally
[2:11:01] is coming out and being revealed
[2:11:04] what he wants us to be
[2:11:06] i'm so glad that the book is in us and
[2:11:09] it's living we can stand with confidence
[2:11:12] today to know
[2:11:14] that god has
[2:11:15] led his dear children amen
