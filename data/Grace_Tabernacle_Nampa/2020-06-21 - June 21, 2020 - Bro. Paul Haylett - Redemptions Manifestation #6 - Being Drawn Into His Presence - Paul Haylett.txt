morning amen I tell you we are some of the most blessed people on the face of the earth amen to just be able to serve the Lord in spirit and in truth amen you know we look into world and you know it's pretty interesting when you look around you see all the things that are symptomatic the warning sounds Amen that the end is near are sounding all around us and people sometimes just struggle you know we get so caught up in life get so caught up in every little circumstance around us that we miss the warning sounds Amen we missed the sign as it were amen well we certainly want to you know some time to get overconfident you think you remember things I believe it's ken and Terry happy to have you here you are well loved by your family here and so that's good to see you and each and every one and kind of happy to be able to read this little note our sister Sharon says I think the Almighty God for allowing me to graduate college I'm very grateful thankful for his mercy upon my life and also please remember in your prayer my fiance's visa documents amen so we definitely want to remember that our sister Sharon just reaching some milestones in your life and god bless you we just get to see God working amen and you know we should never some people say well we don't like to look backwards well that's right we're not frogs we're not looking back but we don't want to forget where we came from amen and in these natural blessings that God has given us he just keeps lifting us up he keeps pouring his blessings out and I say thank you Lord that we can look you know as as as it were you know the little story about I thank the Lord huh not what I should be but I like to condense it down not what I used to be amen and we see God working in our lives and so I say god bless you to each and every one this morning amen I would like to speak to you on redemptions manifestation once again and being drawn into his presence I believe as this song or brother Chris just shared with us is a as I'm singing that there and yes yeah where I'm going what's happening I'm being drawn is it something I've done something you've done you see there's no good thing in us we cannot bring ourselves into his presence but being drawn into his presence we know there's a power in the word that has been manifested into the people now it's interesting the world we live in Saints uh some people say well you know people around the message they think there's something special well I want to put it this way I don't care where you are from and what your life is where you go to church if you claim the name of being a Christian and you don't think you're something special you've missed a revelation there's there's just something a special about being called of God empowered by His Word to live the word amen and watch it come to pass in your life in a husband a wife children grandchildren my brother and sister we ought to not be ashamed to lift up our hand and say I am something special Amen I was created in His image amen I've got his nature the very life is in me hallelujah amen that should be enough for us to stand up and say I'm special amen well speaking on being drawn into his presence this morning why don't we just stand this will go into the Word of God had something else I wanted to share and I I've got to get and remember because I've forgotten already but you know how how beautiful is to be a part of the body of Christ amen John the twelfth chapter we'll start verse 20 amen we'll take our our thoughts out of this scripture today and just hope that you'll be able to find the continuity of our thought you know sometimes is you just go through your week you know you just maybe write a little note down something inspires you and you add something to it you had something to it sometimes it never makes it anywhere but from my little notepad it turns out you realize it's just an inspiration for yourself and I pray that each and every one of you as you go through your your weeks your days or weeks or months your years I pray that you find inspiration if we if we are living off of a dead letter my brother and sister there is no inspiration but if you are living off the living word there is inspiration in that word amen Hallet dictum you know I just remember one time you know many years ago one and only time we ever went down visited brother branham's den brother George Smith shared with us some of brother Browns notes and you know he noted which sermons were which and my brother and sister sometimes all there was was a scripture written on a page there was nothing else and we listened to those very same sermons and are inspired and it's almost like you could say that was preached for today and the inspiration see the Word was alive it was inspiring and that inspiration that was in there didn't need pages and pages and pages and notes it didn't need an encyclopedia because it had Revelation behind it amen and the revelations what opened the word and made it life and that same revelation of Jesus Christ is opening the word today and making it alive to you and I Amen so we should have inspiration in our lives hallelujah amen and there were certain Greeks among them that come up to worship at the feast and the same came therefore to Philip which was of the theta of Galilee I always get a moment if for the rest of my life going to have some humor over that Amen which us which is of b'seder of Galilee desiring sir we would see Jesus Philip cometh and telleth Andrew and again Andrew and Philip telleth Jesus and jesus answered them saying um that the Son of Man be glorified verily verily I say unto you except a corn of wheat fall into the ground and die it abideth alone but if it die it bringeth forth much fruit he that loveth his life shall lose it and he that hateth his life in this world shall keep it in to life eternal If any man serve me let him follow me and where I am there shall also my servant be If any man serve me him will my father honour now is my soul troubled and what shall I say father save me from this hour but for this cause come I unto this hour and father glorify thy name then come there a voice from heaven saying I have both glorified it and will glorify it again the people therefore that stood by and heard it said that it funded others said an angel spake to him jesus answered and said this voice I love this verse right here this voice came not because of me but for your sakes now is a judgment of this world now shall the Prince of this world be cast out and if I and I if I be lifted up from the earth will draw all men unto me this he said signifying what death he should die the people answered him we have heard out of the law that Christ abideth for ever and how say us now the Son of Man must be lifted up and who is this son of man then jesus said unto them yet a little while is the light with you walk while you have the light lest darkness come upon you for he that walketh in darkness knoweth not whither he goeth while you have light believe in the life that ye may be chill of the light these things spake Jesus and departed and did hide himself from them no those last four words five words right there have a greater significance than we would just give to them with a casual reading my brother and sister Christ is standing right here according to the Word of God and yet to the eyes that are blinded he is completely hid but two eyes that have been opened he is so real so present so powerful that it is a life-changing event amen not just going to church not just being at church not belonging to a church but standing in the very presence of God and did you know that if you only feel the presence of God when you come to church something's missing this is where we as Saints of like precious faith gathered together to have our bonfire amen I say that as a bonfire because you brought your liquefier I brought my liquor fire and then you times that lick a fire by however many are present and you have a bonfire amen Heavenly Father we love you today and father we come before you and ask for your guiding hand of mercy upon us today Lord you know the needs that each and every one of us bear Lord you know the disappointments and the struggles the father I know such an awesome God I know a God who loves us in a measure so far beyond we can comprehend as humans then I would pray today Lord don't let our human comprehension of your love restrict us Lord let us step beyond the veil into your presence let the very life of the word be open to us manifested in us Lord that it would give us the strength to stand up Oh father as they say it doesn't matter Lord many places these kind of words come from oh I just reading Lord where they're talking about how in this advanced military training to be rangers and seals and these kind of things often time or it's not the fear of the job to come but it is the endurance to survive what they're facing at the moment that separates them Oh God we ask you today Lord give us strength for every challenge that we face if we have fallen down lord give us the strength to stand up again Lord if we feast faced confusion father let us have the faith to cry out for the peace and the confirmation of our minds Lord Father stir our hearts today we pray in the name of Jesus Christ amen you may be seated Alleluia I had about a half a dozen titles that seemed to kind of come to me on this and I settled on this one because I believe I'll be able to get part two three four and five out of it but you know a thankful for the Word of God as we have spoken several times recently my brother and sister redemptions going to have a manifestation you know if you go to the pawnshop and you pay the price to redeem something and then you turn around and walk out of the pawnshop without that that would be deemed you will be doomed as it were to go back and pay the price again so when you have has been paid for which our Lord Jesus paid for amen to get it in proper context take what is yours take what has been given to you amen now as we look at this I want to touch just a little bit on the scriptures but not a lot before we move on today amen so as we look at this I as I read verse 2 you know the same came there to Philip which is the best Ceyda of Galilee desiring him saying sir we would see Jesus and you know my brother and sister I believe that each and every one of us that should be our heart's desire you know we look in the world day and you know I have quite a cross-section of friends in my life men that I respect very much everything from men who don't even really believe that there is a god that's just kind of all been ordained and we just do what we do and it gets settled up at the end two men that believe that God is real but really don't do much about it and it's hard to kind of contain in mind that you believe that God is real but yet you would ignore what God is doing but still it is you might say a paradox that is there and and then I have friends that are a new name it Methodists Baptists Mormon that are just devout and faithful to a high degree and each one of those would express to you that they would desire to see Jesus and I believe here today each one of us would would say that is our goal otherwise we would not be here and when I think of this or read this scripture I think about the little story about the little boy wanting to see God and talking to mom and then dad and then to the youth leader in the pastor and finally ending up out on the river with the old man and this little boy just just believed there was something inside of this young man that believed it you know he wanted to see God he wanted to to see that and you know finally everybody says well you know quote scripture doe no man can see God but my brother and sister what was in this young boy was not maybe being expressed or received in his expression to the parents and ministry etc in the way the little boy needed to be satisfied they were telling him you know maybe biblical answers maybe correct answer in one sense but it took an old man who sat there on a River watched the Sun Rise watch the Sun fall many things of beauty and you know an old man that would look at him and tell him young man and here's gone every day I see him I see him when the Sun rises I see him when it falls I see all of these saying you know my brother and sister we don't want to come to a place that we find ourselves what I would call landlocked and that that we have such a con chin of what God is doing or how God is going to do it that we quit looking for Jesus Christ because he said he would be with us even in us to the end and so we shouldn't have to look if we're living a life that we should in the sense of reading our Bible and praying we shouldn't have to look any farther than what God is doing in our own life to see Jesus Christ amen and so if you don't see him I pray you find the mirror of the word go start searching it out because you were created in His image and we should come to the place this is not something boastful we're not taking a position higher than someone else but we should be able as it were to stand in the mirror and look in that mirror and say I see Jesus Christ because he promised that he would be in me amen and so it when we come with a confidence to take all that God has promised to us it will stir us to move on and like this little boy we will not be satisfied with the church experience but it will be something much deeper than that and you'll find my brother and sister I don't say this judgmental even though it might sound like it you cannot take the advice or you cannot take the words of an individual because you might ask one individual well what about what is he doing in this day if that person does not believe God's doing anything you walk away with that impression put down into your mind then you will go on through life thinking God's not doing anything if you think you meet someone and you ask that same question to them and they say well gods and his church just go to church you'll find God well my brother and sister then people go to church and they think that's where they will find God but when you find someone that is got a Holy Ghost fire burning inside of them and they will tell you everywhere I turn I cannot pick up my Bible but what I see Jesus Christ I see the Sun Rise I see Jesus Christ I see your sunset I see Jesus Christ I see clouds on the horizon I see Jesus Christ and I see the Sun rising through the clouds I had all my brother and sister how beautiful it is you know on the way to church this morning we drove through by that little church oh I don't remember the name of it but it's the one that's way out in the country on the south side the road there fortune and the folks were coming up to the door and I imagine it was probably the deacon they always get the bad rap so we'll just leave that rap on the D amen and he's standing at the door and he's taking their temperature and I thought well you know it is something of the time we should be uh you know doing that but I wonder if they really truly had had a really Holy Ghost Pentecostal type experience lately it would be quite the opposite because you see as it is right now they're holding that little deal up to take the temperature and it be like whoa your temperatures raised a little bit you can't come to church but what if we had a real Holy Ghost type Pentecostal type experience and it would be like oh we your temperature is high enough you need to go back out and pray some more oh come on Saints we are not come to church chilled out Amen there's no place to be chilled out we should be pressing into the presence of Almighty God we should be on fire and you know I'm not saying this that I think it's an open compass imagine what I bind the spirit of the coronavirus I bind the spirit of the wickedness of this world I pray it over this church Lord bind it amen I believe God he said whatever you bind on earth will be bound in heaven whatever you loose on earth will be loosed in heaven you say well I don't think it applies to that well I don't think God's gonna hold it against me for applying it to that hallelujah amen we don't have to claim every sickness the flus going around I think I've got the flu how about you just say you know what the flu is going around and I reject it in the name of Jesus Christ amen because by here strap I'm already healed so all I'm doing is not being crazy I'm just accepting or claiming what he's already done for me amen hallelujah actually it's kind of fun being a little bit crazy the world around us don't know what to do with you these people go to church and actually enjoy themselves these people go to church and walk out beaming what's wrong with them yeah praise the Lord I'm glad I got something wrong with me hallelujah now what it just bounce a few of these scriptures that just kind of touched me as I was studying them and verse 24 says verily verily i send to you except a corn of wheat fall into the ground and die it abideth alone but if it die it bringeth forth much fruit now my brother and sister every son or daughter of God that has been birthed in Jesus Christ is the fruit amen so we are the fruit of Christ laying down his life for us now we'll do just an extension of that by jumping to verse 27 and he says now is my soul trouble what shall I say my brother and sister you see the human side of Jesus Christ because God put him in that human body and then the human side of him knew that there was pain and suffering coming he knew that this was not going to be a comfortable thing and so there it is in his own expression right in the word he says now is my soul troubled what shall I say father save me from this hour now my brother and sister that would be the result or the effect that many of us would have we we face hard trials we face times in our life sometimes these trials go on for decades they don't just come and blow away like the clouds in in an evening they they stay with us and sometimes people get weary they get wore out from all of the travail in the struggle of life but Jesus is there and he's saying you know I am troubled and what shall I say father save me from this hour but look he said but for this cause come I unto this hour he recognized the calling on his life was not just to come to the threshold or the gate and you know I'm gonna just use this phrase pardon me if it sounds offensive but he didn't come to that point just to chicken out and nor are we called to come to that point and chicken out amen you know the pressure of my friends the pressure of spool of work of this a neighbor of family whatever it is causing us to chicken out my brother and sister if anything have you ever had a real experience you know all of the things around us in this struggle should cause us to be stronger not weaker amen because if we're weaker relying on herself and not upon Jesus Christ so when we are birthed in Christ my brother and sister we become that very fruit and he says Lord save me from this hour but don't you love how buddy is it negates everything right in front of him so while he expressed this Lord saved me from this hour but let's take that off the screen amen it was for this hour amen the claws come I understand sister we live in don't look out here and say well it's so hard to raise a family the schools are are just sinking quickly and the public is sinking quickly all of this is just going downhill rejoice rejoice this is our our Amen not to turn and walk away because it's too hard but turn and face it turn and say Lord no this is the hour a man I don't know would you humor me this morning maybe lift a hand and say Lord this is my hour amen this is the hour for me to shine and let the life of Jesus Christ be expressed in me hallelujah I want to jump down to verse 30 real quick Amen Jesus answers and says that this voice came not because of me but for your sake amen I want to take that right back to Malachi 4:5 people have twisted that up turned that into a knot in such a fashion my brother and sister no wonder it confuses people but if you stop and you look at it just real careful he said behold I send you hallelujah Jesus says this voice was not for me but it was for you Malachi 4:5 says this voice that is coming this Elijah that is coming is for you amen people got it twisted and they want to put the Prophet as it were out front that this is the whole purpose of the message but my brother and sister Malachi 4:5 was a prophet of God claimed as Commission is that the word would come to us so God knew we needed a corrected word a restored word a word that would get us into a rapture a word that would release the faith that is already in us and he says I'm gonna come down and in a supernatural fashion not a theologian not an intellectual not somebody that's going to take you back to the root word of the root the root word in Hebrew that somebody that's gonna make that word alive to you hey man you can have all kinds of it's psycho PDS and this kind of book and that kind of book my brother and sister you can have a room full of Thea sources and references written by all kinds of people but my brother and sister the word has not come alive in you and I it will just be words on that page and it's not about what the words are on the page it's about the life that is in it go into all the world and preach the gospel what was that the life of Jesus Christ hallelujah amen because without that life we got nothing hallelujah Oh amen there's a voice to us in our hour oh my brother and sister we got to listen to that voice verse 32 before we go on into our thoughts and I if I be lifted up from the earth will draw all men unto me hallelujah I want to just take out of this little thought I actually have several quotes bring them to you today because I believe that the content of them in the context that they're brought in is just as good I could explain all this in my own words God be near tonight this part of a prayer oh great angel coming down from God as a messenger come near tonight speak to the people and may your power move the people you see brother Branham didn't stand there and say now this power that I have or this than I am he clearly pointed us back to one power that housed the ability to move the people and so as it's there he says may your power move the people may the Holy Spirit speak into every heart and may there not be a feeble person among us when we leave tonight granted Almighty God so I just bring that as a reference my brother sister that it would come and there would be a power to move the people now I believe we could lift a hand and say I've experienced that power amen move me from where I was people would say well you know maybe it wasn't a bad person in the beginning there it wasn't a whole lot of moving to do my brother and sister there certainly is a whole lot of moving to go because you know what we we just don't we don't have what it takes it's not within us we don't have the ability I think mother but.maybe said that as in his prayer there Lord we have this ability we can bring ourselves to live a life that would be pleasing to God I'm sorry just not in US but that doesn't mean we'll touch on it in a minute that does not mean that we have a does not does not we don't have a part amen you see we can't just sit back and say well if God placed the seed in my life before the foundation in the world then I was on that Lamb's Book of Life God will just take care of it look just somehow happened my brother and sister it might happen right after you've been drugged through your fiftieth novel now if you like not holes then you just keep hanging on to your ideology and you just go for the ride and then later on you'll say man I'm so beat up well just remember it was your own fault because you said that you just wouldn't go that way and God said yes you will amen but look at this speaking this morning on being drawn into his presence right so as it is there's nothing in us as it is and others that would cause us to serve the Lord to paraphrase the scripture kind of bring it all together we were born in sin can we say amen to that amen we were shaped in iniquity amen hallelujah well I'll tell you what my brother and sister you don't have to teach a child to lie in fact you don't have to teach an adult to lie there's just something in the nature that will sometimes you know especially when we don't want to embarrass ourselves we can craft this sentence come on you know what I'm talking about we can craft the sentence in such a way who broke this all I know is somebody did we know good and well we broke it but we no want to embarrass ourselves you know Jerry and I flew to Denver the other day had to take care of a little business we're sitting in the airport in a little restaurant I guess you would call it or whatever they said well because the social distancing we only have half our tables do you mind sitting at this little narrow bar and I liked it because it's looking out for the way over the airport and I'm sitting there and and so the lady brought straws and she is um down there and you know it I thought well maybe I'll use this straw I went to reach for the straw and I knocked my glass of water over and we know that the carpenter who built those counters didn't build it good because it ran that way and you know it's funny because the words that come out of my mouth was Wow I wanted a straw on the glass got in the way but if we set that glass there and watched it for days weeks or months it would never move but you see it's in the human element that we would kind of phrase it in a way trying to not be embarrassed because everybody around us every table and people down the counter in both directions are all looking well he's not a child it's in US my brother and sister to cover our tracks is it not born in sin shaped in iniquity come into the world speaking lies cysts the nature of humanity and we could dwell on that and talk about how bad we were and how desperately we needed a savior which is all true it did not but my brother and sister I think there's something even greater to talk about than that that there is an anointing that comes upon us to put into action the very word of God for our hour amen it's not about what I was but it's what God said I would be and so I don't look back to what I was but I look at to the anointing of God that is upon my life upon your life that is causing me to change amen empowering me to take step after step two moves it doing its drawing us I tell you there's been times in my life I've quit I wouldn't say I quit serving God but I certainly quit being a pastor quit being a minister so many times it would embarrass me in your presence if I told you that it was literally in the dozens and dozens but you don't know that amen so you look at that and realize my brother and sister there is an anointing that comes upon man or a woman a child a teenager whatever in the day that we're living that Satan would offer such a beautiful picture and he might lose you forever you'll itself to Satan's picture of who you are amen the word has come and the word has painted a picture that shows you that you are a son you are sure of God and this anointing which we know is the Holy Ghost put into action the word and it changes our lives right Amen this anointing right have you ever studied the the theorem of cause and effect Amen it's very interesting because it applies in so many portions in our life Amen now my brother and sister there always has I preached this down in Phoenix sometime back there has to be an action for there to be a reaction Amen if there was no sin in the world and then there would be no action to cause us to see and if there was no sin there but if the Holy Ghost was not here there could be no action to cause you to be subjected or submitted to the Holy Ghost so we real there is the spirits in the framework of the third because sin is ever-present amen Satan is here he has a great realm of influence and it is quite easy to serve the devil but my brother and sister I'll tell you this you will have to walk over every promise of God to get into hell amen so it's there as God is working amen his word is here and the anointing comes and it causes a cause and effect and it sometimes takes quite a while now you can take a medicine maybe you have a little something an infection and you know the doctor puts you on an antibiotic or you go on something that's natural and you're taking that you can't get up the next morning and say well my infection or my issue is gone it's got a SoCo I hope you catch this this morning it's got to soak down into every cell in your body a man that medication as it were has to reach every portion of your body it can't just go to your hand it can't just go to your foot it can't just go to your heart it's got to in permeate every portion of your body and my brother and sister I don't want just the Holy Ghost on the outside I don't want the Holy Ghost on Sunday or Wednesday I want the Holy Ghost to change me I've got an infection and it's called unbelief and that unbelief if I feed it will foster and grow but if I will allow the Holy Ghost to work its way right down into every portion of my body I will wake up one morning and it is an absolute that you cannot convince me any different I am a son of God and I will be an overcomer in the day that I live in why because it has reached every portion every fiber of my being is now given over to Jesus Christ amen without that my brother and sister will still have doubts and we'll still have fears and we will be bound by the things of this life amen so it's there I want to take this calls in effect for just a moment to bring this in this realm right here you see my brother and sister this anointing that comes upon mankind it will come in such a and oftentimes we don't even recognize we're anointed and in that I will say that sometimes you will find people they will treat people they love they won't treat them very well and over time when they get delivered from that they'll look back and say how did I ever do that I know people in that condition how did I ever treat my wife or my children like that my brother and sister there's a brother back east it's a long story but uh you know the brother when he got delivered one day God just come down supernaturally delivered from that and the very first thing that he realized this I've done my wife and my children such a great harm in such a disrespect and the very first thing even before he actually you might say went back to church and got everything right he went to knelt down got on his knees before his wife and said I I don't know how or why I done this but I have done you so wrong please forgive me but see he was under an influence and he did he didn't even realize that anointing was causing him a man who felt justified so my brother and sister calls in effect comes and an anointing would come and I'd leave this analogy or example before we move on why is it that some are anointed to curse and take the name of our Lord Jesus Christ in vain people who looked you in the eye and say I am and use the name of Jesus Christ in vain there's got to be an anointing there got to be something that's that's causing them where they can't see I mean it's right in Scripture all they got to do is read their Bible but that anointing that's on them it's just another word my brother and sister never let us bring that as just another word amen while others are anointed to lift up the name of Jesus Christ and to praise Him and just sell their life out to him this my brother and sister the two spirits in the framework of the church amen one being drawn to step over the word in this direction one being drawn to step over the word in this direction you say well brother Paul you use the phrase step over the word that's right my brother and sister you'll either stay way away from the veil stepping into the things of this world or you will step beyond the veil amen so you've got a step beyond that divide one side or the other no such thing as the middle road amen hallelujah amen John John James 4:7 amen says submit yourselves therefore to God I think that's one of the problems we have we believe God we testify about God we won't submit to him amen we don't really want to control our life we just want him to bless it come on I don't want to speak harshly to you this morning but look if you if you find yourself not obedient to the word but asking God for blessings you need to stop and figure out where you were at amen because we are called to submit ourselves therefore to God resist the devil and he will flee from you you realize that as a simplest recipe that was ever given but it's a hard one to fulfill amen the devil he comes and he talks and he's such a sweetheart you know one thing I learned I hope you see the humor in this sister Jerry and I being in the South years ago and you know maybe somebody would say something about that guy I remember I remember the first time I heard this you know there's like well that man acts like a fool bless his heart I thought that's a strange saying but I heard it a lot down there in the South yeah guys a real jerk bless his heart she's lazier than a slug bless her heart finally I was like ask one friends of ours I said yes so what's the deal this bless your heart well that's when you know you shouldn't have said what you said but you kind of just cover it up a little bit I don't want to hear any bless your hearts around here I want to hear God bless you I want to hear you I love you in the Lord but let's just let's not let that bless your heart thing creep into the church right amen another brother called it respectable slander yeah the Michell ourselves therefore to God resist the devil he will flee from you draw nigh to God see this is what I said earlier here there has to be an action on our part we can't just sit back and say God's going to take care of all this but right here it's telling us you draw nigh to God in other words you got to pick up from wherever you're sitting and you've got to move a little bit now you say brother Paul I've had some difficulties and I some things and I just don't know that I can just completely just go well look just move an inch if that's all you can move move an inch I heard a brother one time you said look you people you won't hardly you want God to do something for you you won't do nothing for God why don't you at least list a finger amen if those if the preacher is preaching everybody's lifting their hands but you don't feel like lifting your hand at least lift a finger draw nigh to God and He will draw nigh to you see that's all it takes for us to do just start drawing nigh to him cleanse your hands you sinners purify your hearts you double-minded amen you know what we can look at this and say well praise the Lord that's for all those unbelievers out there but remember brothers sister it's easy for us all we got to do is let one little thing creep back into our life amen one thing come on just be an attitude come on our attitudes we love them we love them more than we love our cellphones come on you might have forgot your phone at home you might left it in the car but you didn't leave your attitude at home you didn't leave it in the car we take our attitude everywhere we go we love our attitude what if it's our attitude that is the very thing that's holding us back what if we would stop and say Lord thy will be done if we could come to that place we can literally lift our heart our hand just a finger and say Lord thy will be done you know as I've said to you church many many times if we believe we're the only ones we've got the only revelation we've got the only move of God if we've got that my brother and sister that's the wrong attitude we are sinners saved by grace and we should by the Word of God be able to look out and realize that we are here to shine our light and it's not our light it's the light as the scripture there I was going to expound on that a little bit ago that light is not us right we are the moon he is the Sun we are reflecting that light if we're reflecting anything less than the pure light that means that we're not standing in the presence of pure light don't stand up and say we're the only ones that got it look do I feel like I want to clarify that do I feel like that God's blessed us more than than what the denominational movements are now yes I do brother and sister because like I already told you I have many friends of the denominations and I see what they do and I see how they behave and I see their business practices and their family practices and the kind of Friday night family movies they watch and the music that they listen to I believe God's done something for us but if we have the truth and an arrogant spirit we're going to be just as bad off as anyone else amen you got to be say I I believe I got the truth but also I've got the grace of God and God by His grace is the reason I in the light today halleluja halleluja is this okay okay hallelujah amen now in Jehovah Jireh I like this it's a very lengthy quote so please be patient with me now if that's right and if Jesus will come to this platform and in these people and will produce the same kind of life and do the same things that he did here on earth will you accept him for your needs will you raise your hand to him I say that's relevant this morning will you accept him for your needs we raised our hand hey man I'm gonna accept him for my needs today amen I will accept him for my need alright Lord bless you now brother branham are you afraid to make that kind of statement no sir he promised it it's his promise now the critics of brother Branham would say well he's just scooting it off because over here he said this and he said that well my brother and sister I just want to follow you around for a month and record all your conversations and when you're sitting there eating chocolate I'm gonna play that little thing back to you oh no thank you I don't like chocolate no you just don't like their chocolate No we're human my brother and sister not be a critic let's look at this he's trying to point us to Jesus Christ not to be let he said it this way here and said it that way there oh my goodness I always just get I'm sorry my attitude I get flamed when people get all curse well this was like this and they said this I'm talking to him talking about the Prophet I'm strong Bela well he said this over here and he could have used the name of Jesus Christ but he said God fine in the beginning was the word and the word was with Jesus Christ technically it was but that's not what the word says but then it turns on tells us that all things were made for and by him meaning who Jesus Christ come on let's not get let's not get so critical that we cannot catch what God's really doing Oh are you afraid to make that kind of statement no sir he promised it it's his promise no matter anything contrary to it I say it's a lie God said so that settles it it's a gift and he by yielding and he yourself to the Spirit of God God is the same Jesus is the same he works the same he lives the same he acts the same he acts in you as he would if he was here on earth I'll get that he acts in you as he would if he was right here this morning hallelujah well Jesus Christ walked into our church this morning and we all had to throw this away and throw that and hot under the blanket and I ran back out to the car and no shouldn't be that way Amen we should be living life that he's standing here because he is he acts in you as would if his here on earth and what did he say ye are the vine is that right no now stop yeah I want to take it with humour Saints you know I sometimes do that to you guys you know just throw that but look ease is that right I imagine there's a little Paul's in there I just wanted to see if I could catch you audition or what branches I am the vine hallelujah good it sank you've read the trevor thank you if he if he wasn't already my ally he certainly was on that one there Alleluia but you see we're not going to be condemned because we do that because the thing is is we relate to that scripture and we know we're a part of that but we got to get everything in its proper order and the prophets trying to put it in the right order amen you know C's shows you a little sense of humor right here amen but he wasn't being critical he just was got a sense of humor and my the day we lose our sense of humor the day we've lost our zest for life yeah you're what branches I am the vine but now the vine doesn't bear fruit does it Oh see how beautiful this is or what God's doing my brother and sister he is flowing through you and I God could have said nope I'm gonna be the life the root and bring it all up bear the fruit myself and I don't need any other fruit but he said what I want to do is I want to live through you I want my life to come so powerful through you that when people would look at you they would say I believe I have met Jesus Christ why because it would be his nature his life coming forth in us not some cold formal you know well I tell you I grew up in a church I grew up in a church my brother and sister and it fostered a great hate in I'm sorry to use that word but that's how I feel about it because there was so many brother deals and it was though he who is the most clever come out on top come on and I've said it before I'll say it again if brother deals ever invade this church I will call it right from the pulpit you'll either accept that or kick me out because I won't be silent because you can't brother deal a brother and say you've got the Holy Ghost and the love of Christ and his nature and his life in you in fact it ought to be the opposite a brother and you might disagree you want to say here brother take a greater portion nah hmm excuse me while I repent from this attitude but my brother and sister you see if he is the vine and we are the branch we have to produce what is in the vine ah we can't come and say well I believe in the vine I believe in the vine and I'm gonna produce what I want to produce no you're tapped into something else besides the love and the life of Jesus Christ amen hallelujah the branch now look me are the branches now I want to draw off of this here I actually was going to separate this in the into difference messenger sermons man I just couldn't amen the branch is energized praise the Lord I'm in church on Sunday again hope the preacher don't preach too long I'm not brave enough to shake the keys sigh or put my coat on but man I would so like to be but down to burger Danny the big double whopper Oh am I being blunt I mean to be because you're not offending the preacher you're not offending the church you're offending God and the word said that the branch is energized and whatever energy that the vine pours into the branch the branch has to then let it out my brother and sister you know we farm right out there by around a bunch of grapes amen I learned a lot of lessons out there my friend one time told me I asked him a question I said so so a what about the little foxes and he said well we don't have to Fox is here but we have little coyotes and I said so you know we're eating the grapes is that an issue he said no what it is is actually when it's dry out now this brought revelation of the scripture to me he said when it's dry out they smell the water as it is in the grape and they start chewing around the base of the plant trying to get to the water and they gird the plant and it dies this scripture says the little fox spoils the vine what do they do they gird it till there's no life left in the church no life forget the church no life left in us we're just good message we're good message and we go to church and we can say look the supernatural happened over there and look the supernatural happened over there and the supernatural went on over here where's the supernatural in you are we girded my friend Dale I said well what do you do in a plants been girded he said we rip it out of the ground it'll never produce he said but there is one hope for it if it's got good roots with no with no rot we'll sawed it off and graft in another branch Oh hallelujah I don't want to get sidetracked here this morning oh my we bring forth his life he energizes us we bring forth his life as he brings it through us whether it's the preaching of the gospel by lip or by it's seeing a vision by eye or whether whatever it is laying hands on the sick whatever it is it's Christ working through the branches of his church every office literally electrified by his presence hallelujah now we got some company today and I don't want to get too carried away so anyway but look my brother and sister we ought to be an electrified church well we ought not be some just dead letter people that we believe a message and God's going to come back and take us in a rapture and all these other poor sorry folks I tell you what my brother and sister if you're in that position then somebody's cut the power off to you because the power of God will make you be excited the power of God will bring to life in you the very life of Jesus Christ my brother and sister do you know that if you want Big Apple's what do you do you prune the tree that's what God's doing to you and I my little thank you for all being part of my story today you see I don't have an attitude you know why because every time I get an attitude the Holy Ghost comes down and says boy who do you think you are hmm I was born a hail it Lord help me look under attitude in the dictionary and it'll probably have a family picture but you know what God does starts to pruning pretty soon you realize you're not quite as important or quite as smart or quite as whatever is you thought you were and you realize after a while Lord you know what if it wasn't for you Lord I'd probably be or whatever out here I'd be just like them Lord if it wasn't for you hmm amazing I like to preach these deep things of the message every office pastor are you listening ministry are you listening trustees are you listening treasurer are you listening Deacons are you listening and did you know in a member a layperson of the church is also an office so are we listening we ought to be on fire we ought to be electrified amen will not be just dead well you know I do this and nobody else does this amen you know I'm the only one that does this and nobody else does this oh come on you're not doing it for me you're not doing it for them you're doing it for Jesus Christ well electrified saints we ought to be energized by the life that's in the vine that ought to come down to where it literally electrifies us Oh what does he say right here and if I and I if I be lifted up from the earth will draw all men unto me what's happening there the drawings taking place amen now look death burial resurrection of our Lord Jesus Christ is a fulfillment of prophecy now his promise to us is he would draw us to him my brother and sister that will come just as sure as there was a death burial and resurrection will be a drawing amen a pulling to him amen now I've got more quotes than we've got time today so I'll just go for just another minute or two and then we'll just have to we'll just have to maybe make this another part here not long ago up at Gary Indiana I was up there in a meeting and a fellow took me over to show me their big mill and I was looking down there how pretty it was and we're standing way up in a big Coppola like this and you're up on a big place you're looking and little whistle blows five minutes before quitting time and every man throwed his blanket like that or his little thing that he wore around him look and went to sweeping shavings out in the middle of the aisles every man swept his shavings out and he said wait a minute Reverend I will show you something peculiar I said all right sir and after every whistle another whistle blows and all of them went out he said now watch this he touched the button and I heard something coming making a roar noise roar noise and I said what is that he said just watch and it come from way somewhere way back way back in the back come right down over on a over a trestle a little wall run down and as it run through there all those shavings jumped right up and met it went right on out and he took the magnetism magnetism out of it and went to Coppola and was made over again that's the way we pick up all the scraps amen yes sir I said yes sir what I want to know why didn't all of them go he said there's still some more shavings there he said well you see sir sir they're aluminum they're not magnetized to it hallelujah and he said say what's the matter with you I said don't get excited I haven't heard anyone yet I said why didn't that piece of metal go there he said why sir it's bolted down I said glory and he said what's the matter with you I said I'm thinking about their great big magnet sitting yonder in the sky that dynamo of the Holy Ghost and there's a people down here being magnetized and if you want to be aluminum or shackle down with some Creed go ahead but there's some people magnetized to it and someday God's going to press the button and that magnets coming down and she's going up yonder over to be made hallelujah amen and they'll go to that great Coppola of gods refinery and they make creatures in Christ Jesus that'll never die again hallelujah hey man yes sir they'll be molded and made like unto his own glorious body amen we'll never have another prayer meeting for the sick or another one for the sinners because they'll be none amen oh thank you amen excuse me no don't excuse me I don't mean that sir no sir I feel good I'm just rejoicing in the God of power who knows I stand here I know he's the same yesterday today and forever now the Lord Jesus bless you help you I love you God loves you God want you to get well God is in his creation you believe it God is in his word you believe it God was in his son you believe in God emptied himself into Jesus Christ you but even Jesus Christ emptied himself into the church isn't that right that's God in his that's God's then God's in His Word God's in his creation God's in his son God's in his people you believe it then Jesus Christ the same yesterday today and forever is that right what he did then he can do now is that right we love him we believe him amen we've got our souls magnet magnetized with power tonight that'll take us up in a rapture hallelujah what's God doing my brother and sister he didn't just work on one end he come right down here we talk about the Word of God talks about the scripture about a seed and how it was planted what did God do he's the one made that seed to respond hallelujah it can no more not respond then it can say that it is but it is it and it might be but it won't be my brother and sister it either is simply it is or it isn't and the word spoke to you the word spoke to me and said you are sons and daughters of God I have poured out my spirit upon you I did fill you with the Holy Ghost I called you before the foundation of the world I am the bloody lamb Oh hallelujah how can we not respond to that hey man there's no way we can turn into the turn our back to that amen God given us the greatest blessing ever given to mankind when he come down and magnetized our soul to respond to the word hallelujah now look at that I want to go back this might sound a little harsh amen but forgive me but you know my brother and sister you look at this and you can choose to be aluminum if you to be you can choose to be bolted down by the cares of life if you want to be but I don't choose to be a man I choose to be a son of God I'll lift my hand and I will testify and ice to it as it is I maybe I should put it this way but I'll share with you I stood in my office this morning and I cried out to God Lord don't let me be anything but what the word says a son or daughter of God would be that is my heart's cry hallelujah it is not me boasting it is not me being lifted up it is me pouring my heart out to God Lord what your word says is what I want to be hallelujah and God loved me so much he sent a prophet come down and corrected the ears of the Methodist Church he corrected the ears of the Mormon Church he corrected the errors of the Catholic Church I'm talking about my family I'm talking about the influences and where in my life when I was young he corrected those hairs and he put us right back here and said here's my word stay with my word it's the road map there's no shortcut your name on a book nowhere it don't mean no more than you can write but whenever that seed of life was magnetized by the Word of God it will draw you through denomination it draws you through the thick it draws you through the thin draws you through the mud it draws you through the water of separation it just keeps it on you the word says you might have to forsake mother and father and sister and brother and houses and lands did it right that so it would return void no sir somewhere along the line there's been saints that had forsake their families forsake every possession they ever had and you say how could they do that because they were magnetized and something just kept pulling down they couldn't stop how did they do that I don't know other than a great magnet was pulling them hallelujah you know it's interesting you went to a power of a magnet now I don't remember if if I get this wrong correct me OK but I believe it's a cat-scan that if you have metal in your body it will heat it up to where you feel like you are cooking and it will do its best to pull it right up into your body because it's a giant magnet going around and around your body now just think of the power of that I knew a man once he actually older man he has quite an extensive array of tattoos and I'm not speaking against the tattoos I'm just making a point they were back in some day when there was something in the ink and so he was getting a cat scan and uh they put him in there and there tell him surly as still as you can blah blah only take a minute they fired that thing he said it made one revolution and he couldn't help himself he screamed so loud they heard him in the hallways and they stopped it and they said sir it's your arm isn't it he said oh he said it felt like it was a thousand prickles of heat and it felt like my skin was being pulled now if man's invention will do that to the human body what will be the Creator when he starts to pull on the heart of a son or daughter of God well he couldn't be me I'm in this terrible condition I'm in this terrible situation it couldn't be me Oh you just watch it starts pulling and it keeps right on pulling and it might take years to pull you from that mud hole but it'll pull you right out of that mud hole can we say thank you lord Alleluia oh my can I have just another minute or two amen it'll go right in here just want to expound this a little bit be a little bit redundant sometimes it's good be redundant amen you know sometimes I mean I have employees you know and you'll tell them and something you just realize they didn't catch it and you feel awkward right because you just can't spend ten minutes explaining and you know it's gonna take another ten minutes to explain it but you feel compelled to explain it again and some employees will say I got it I got it and then they go out mess it up others will say to themselves if he wants to pay me for listening to him explain it again I mean no problem redundancy is a bad thing and a good thing hallelujah there is a great magnet sitting in the sky that God one day will touch his fingers to no man knows the time he's coming not even the angels of heaven don't know God alone knows but there has been some trimmings that's come off of the Bible Bible Christians believers for this hour and one of them might have been an axle you got a for real careful to catch what prophets say he's talking about this same time that he spent in the foundry right one of them might have been an axle back in another day this might have been some other part it's going on to make the great big regime of God but it'll be molded into the pot of God's great Coppola and poured out again into the image of God are you with him in other words you're saying it didn't matter what you was before you're just an axle you were just something trimmed off here you were just some here but when you're put back through the word and you get poured out and you come out in the image of God and those who are magnetized to it will be taken up Oh how - what a privilege it is to know that there's something in the resurrection that's pertaining to us now notice recognize the call of God's word which he is a part of and it's an eagle - an eagle now if that mother would have screamed like a buzzard I look some fairly strong things in the last few weeks Saints when one screams like a buzzard what are you going to attract I'm not talking about people no don't misunderstand me talk about spirits you got sons and daughters of God they cannot respond to anything that is not the Word of God God put it in us we have to respond to it I heard the cry of an evil I'm an evil huh you know you're an eagle I understood how do you know you're a son or daughter of God because the word is coming real to you the word is manifesting itself in you and you realize the only way I could respond to this is I am a daughter of God I am a son of God that's why it makes sense Oh hallelujah yeah I might have been an axle I don't even really care I could have been a rusty pull brakes you when I've been melted down remoulded poured out again and now I get to come forth in the image of Jesus Christ hallelujah Oh hallelujah amen amen eagle to an eagle now if that mother would have screamed like a buzzard he didn't never knowed it he's just been as oh this see this is really pointed actually you know people don't like pointed remarks my brother and sister but I'm not saying the pointed remark so that's my excuse hey man hey what the mothers screamed like a buzzard he never knowed it he didn't bend just as well off in the barnyard see if you start responding to the Buzzard you might as well just stay in the barnyard don't go out here and tell these people if you don't believe this you're this and you're that my brother and sister come on come on God's warning control amen but it was the scream of an eagle there was something inside that little fellow that he knowed he was an eagle Oh hallelujah hallelujah and the same thing is with every true believer when the preaching of God's Word come forth and is indicated and prove that it's God's Word for this hour then there's something within the believer can someone say amen to that I don't care how loyal his father was to a church how loyal his mother was or his grandparents or if that church is teaching contrary to this hour of the baptism of the Holy Ghost message there's something in him that screams out look let's get this right what is he saying this is a relationship between you and Almighty God it's not a relationship between you and a prophet and you and a pastor you and of this and a you and of that it's between you and God hallelujah we got to cut to the chase of all this well if you don't go to this church and you don't do this and you don't believe that and you don't do this my brother and sister if you are called of God you respond to that Paul the Eagle scream and the Eagles cry back and you that he said I'll lead you and guide you to alter oh you know what I don't I don't mean to belabor this but it just keeps coming up someone might say well you've got way too much confidence in that tell me how we can have too much confidence in God he said I will lead you I will guide you this work I began in you I will finish it they don't get any more confidence than that my brother and sister they don't get to a place that you've got anything else an anchor to but the Word of God and the cry that you have heard hallelujah does that mean we can go off the word I heard the cry I heard the cry now now I'm this and I'm that all bow down and worship me they'd have to put a new door in the side of this building because you'd be out of here so quick and it should be rightly so or maybe I'd be the one that created the new doors you threw me out know if they don't line up with the word Saints if you can't take it back to the Bible then it didn't come from God the chicken oh let me find myself I'm lost there's something in him that screams out he'll leave the barnyard he's got to do it the chicken might have been alright one day but this is Eagle our see it's a difference there's something he must leave the old coop and fly away into the blue then this earthly body is quickened and brought by the quickening spirit to the obedience of God's Word my brother and sister I'll just put it this way I've said it before I'll just share it again this is my understanding okay I'm not trying to say it's a revelation I'm gonna say to have some great understanding but you know it was brought up to you one time brother Paul how was it when brother Branham had these meetings power of God come discernment of the Spirit healings took place sometimes thousands of witnesses to these men brother Brown turns around and tells him now go back to your church be faithful at your post of duty had a brother asked me one time younger brother he's Paul how could how did why did brother Brown do that how could he do that cuz you see this eagle it's not gonna stay in that barn you're right you don't need to proselyte in fact I tell you my brother and sister I look to the lowest degree of proselyte yes I'm talking about in its true form I'm not talking about a friend or family member encouraging somebody to come worship with us I'm talking about proselyting how can their prophet knew the minute these people that had heard the cry went and set back down and their church said the days of miracles are past just sign your name on the book be faithful come give a little money to our charity come to this event that event look my family was Methodist for quite long time I'm not so old or young however you look at it to not remember what like to be a Methodist we went to church and they cared about us children's much they let us go running up and down the back halls of the church where no one could hear us young people I love you so much I'm gonna preach and make you endure hearing me talk about Jesus Christ because I love you so much a good friend of Mines wife had cancer she was dying the doctor said there's absolutely not one hope he asked everybody he didn't care what church he went to he picked up his Bible one day and God took him right to that scripture and he said this is real God's a healer he didn't go around say now are you Episcopalian that's what he was are you piss Kop alien do you believe in this no he didn't everybody that stopped moving for a moment pray for my wife pray for my wife pray for my wife pray for my wife now I'll sound judgmental here I hope this won't offend Owen but he went to a church they stopped halfway through and half the church went out on the back portico smoked a cigarette because they couldn't make it for a flower cigarette and included the preacher now you wonder how things get confusing he had everybody that he ever met in his life all the wave from the hardware store to the lumber store to the Builder that we worked for to everybody pray for my wife and one day his wife got so sick and she literally was telling him honey come give me a kiss and a hug it's over and he thought it can't be I believe that Scripture she lives through the night the next day she got up and said honey would I'm dying anyhow what's it matter about diets and all this stuff I like some toast with butter and jam on it and he was like whatever you want honey could I have a cup of coffee also the Prophet God talks about these same Saints people criticize the Prophet for talking the way he does but if they'll open their eyes and their ears wander through this world you'll find out that God is doing the very things the Prophet talked about right out here and I don't always have the name message attached to it because if you have faith in God come on is this too one message for us his wife is alive today as far as I know now you tell him that living the way he lives is not right and I have this friend my friend's name was Larry Larry you can't lie you're gonna be a Christian you can't tell lies God healed my wife Larry you can't steal God healed my wife don't tell me God won't he healed my wife you see where that became a bridge in his life but it won't line up with the word of God but now not sound bad last time I saw Larry he ran up to me threw his arms around me lifted me off the ground well it's so good to see you you know how I met him I was unloading tools in a house and he said I've been watching you boy he said are you a Christian well you know what my life at that time I felt like I was about the size of a Christian and he said I've been watching your life are you a Christian and I said well sir I'm trying to be this man total stranger to me I mean I just seen him on the jobs he walks absent friend of my shirt and pulled me up and he says you either are or you aren't I was like who is this guy

designating stuff so if you be kind and not laugh at me brother Sergei senior is you Leah's father brother Sergei jr. is her husband and that's how I operate my little world to keep them but I was talking with sister yulia's dad brother Sergei soon senior and he's sharing with me that believers in the rural parts Russia Ukraine some of those other countries I always slips my mind those other ones I'm forgive me they're having a just a terrible time Saints brother Sergei was sharing with me of a brother calling not even able to completely recount the situation's they're dealing with before he broke down we need to lift them up diligently in our prayers amen we're going to do more than just lift him up in prayers we have already financially helped them we don't say anything like that to boast but just simply the burden is great and now this might come out awkward to forgive me but we have the representation of that part of the world right here in our midst amen we have families that that these people are not unknown to them they are not just casual someone there it's real and we also are getting feedback from believers that we are very personally almost as close as family to us in South America that in their little towns almost every bit of work has ceased and there is nothing for them to do you can't beg a job we need to lift them up we need to be praying for them and we will be I will be working with the brothers and we'll be working to find a solution you might say in the financial sign to help some of these believers but the money is good money's good I have on my phone if you don't mind me just sharing this brother Sergei Senior Center brother Sergei jr. my precious brother videos I have on my phone of believers saying thank you it stirs your heart whether Sergei says brother Paul you don't need to know Russia to understand how appreciative they are and they are speaking and I don't understand one single word they're saying but you can see the sincerity let's be faithful Saints just as we can look across the aisle or down the Pew or front to back here and say you know what I'm praying for my brother and praying for my sister don't forget another part of the body of believers is outside of our state outside of our nation outside of our continent okay let's be faithful to lift them up before the Lord hallelujah god bless you amen thank you Lord for saving my soul thank you [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music]
