[30:38] good to see you here tonight brother
[30:39] Daniel Amen Hallelujah each and every
[30:42] one of you so good to see you we
[30:47] um I'm hoping to just be on the short
[30:50] side this evening so uh we'll just Dive
[30:55] Right In thank you musicians
[30:58] so very much um brother Alex thank you
[31:02] amen let's just stand and turn in our
[31:05] Bibles The Book of John the 14th chapter
[31:08] verses
[31:10] 8-14 now as we look at this we'll we'll
[31:14] find I I preached last week you know
[31:16] proving the word in you and that is
[31:19] really us uh seeing that God is faithful
[31:23] seeing how that God has has never come
[31:26] short and look how Satan he tries so
[31:29] hard I mean he puts overtime into
[31:32] getting you and I to doubt the word and
[31:35] what he's really doing is getting us to
[31:37] doubt the word that's in US amen the
[31:40] devil will say well of course they're
[31:43] spiritual people they're living very
[31:45] overcoming lives but you see what what
[31:49] we don't see is their
[31:51] battle now let's think about job it was
[31:55] only those in job's community that even
[31:58] understood or saw what was happening
[31:59] with job over the hill and down the
[32:02] corner and around by the river they had
[32:05] no clue what was happening in job's life
[32:07] but God was proving himself in job and
[32:11] it affected those around him but the
[32:13] real story uh you know the devil doesn't
[32:16] say well it's the Community Job lives
[32:19] it's was job amen and so God is here to
[32:22] prove to you and I that he is here now
[32:26] tonight I'd just like to touch on this
[32:28] just for a few minutes God's wanting to
[32:31] prove that you're the word amen he he
[32:34] doesn't want us to be parrots now I you
[32:38] know I used to do a pretty good
[32:40] imitation of Paulie the Parrot uh and
[32:43] and uh you know I won't do that tonight
[32:46] but but um you know if we're not careful
[32:49] we become parrots and and um God never
[32:52] called us to be a parrot he called us to
[32:55] be sons of God Warriors Amen to be
[32:58] vigilant with the word believer strong
[33:02] called the
[33:03] Saints and so we want to take that and
[33:06] you know just tonight sometimes it's
[33:09] good just to stir up our Pure minds and
[33:11] Remembrance right sometimes really
[33:14] really really good deeps preaching is
[33:16] awesome sometimes just stirring up our
[33:19] Pure Minds just to be reminded that that
[33:22] um you know this is who I am and and uh
[33:26] there's plenty of evidence Saints
[33:28] there's just insurmountable amount of
[33:32] evidence that we are Sons and Daughters
[33:34] of God
[33:35] yeah until we forget we
[33:38] are and then all the evidence is out
[33:41] there and all the evidence applies to
[33:43] someone else and it's everybody else's
[33:45] family that's Overcomers and and we're
[33:47] struggling and we're having mind battles
[33:50] and mental struggles and feel like we're
[33:52] oppressed depressed suppressed and and
[33:55] in that case right there we've just
[33:57] completely forgotten that we're the word
[34:00] and God just wants to remind you I
[34:02] believe a little bit tonight that's to
[34:04] remember that no matter what comes your
[34:06] way uh to to keep uh God between you and
[34:10] your circumstance and not let your
[34:12] circumstance become between you and God
[34:15] and and when we will keep the word
[34:18] between us and our circumstance uh
[34:21] suddenly the reflection of the word I
[34:23] don't remember who who gave that example
[34:26] here recently we were doing that but uh
[34:30] when the word is right here what can you
[34:33] see when it's right here but when the
[34:36] word is
[34:37] distant we see everything else around us
[34:41] and so by God's grace we'll amen just
[34:44] have a little enjoyable time tonight
[34:47] John
[34:48] 148 Philip saith unto him Lord show us
[34:52] the father and it suffices us Jesus
[34:57] saith to him have I been so long time
[35:01] with you could we just apply that
[35:04] tonight has he been so long time with us
[35:09] yes sir that we still
[35:10] forget and yet hast thou not known me
[35:13] Phillip he that hath seen me hath seen
[35:16] the father and how sayest thou then show
[35:20] us the father believest thou not that I
[35:23] am in the father and the father in me
[35:26] the words that I speak unto you I speak
[35:28] not of myself but the father that
[35:31] dwelleth in me he doeth The Works
[35:34] believe me that I am in the father and
[35:36] the father in me or else believe me for
[35:39] very Works
[35:41] sake believe me that I am in the father
[35:44] and the father in me or else believe me
[35:46] for the very Works sake verily verily I
[35:49] say unto you he that believeth on me the
[35:52] works that I do shall he do also and
[35:55] Greater Works than these shall he do
[35:58] because I go unto my father and
[36:00] whatsoever you shall ask in my name that
[36:03] will I do that the father may be
[36:05] glorified in the son and if you shall
[36:08] ask anything in my name I will do it
[36:12] amen Heavenly Father we thank you
[36:14] tonight just Lord just give us
[36:16] inspiration anointing to just share
[36:18] what's on our heart bless the Saints
[36:20] tonight and those that are not with us
[36:22] whether they be traveling father or
[36:24] whatever the circumstance might be
[36:26] father we just ask you to speak to
[36:28] Hearts bless them strengthen them keep
[36:30] them in your precious name amen you may
[36:33] be seated amen as we look at this
[36:37] tonight you know uh I want to just
[36:40] represent this as a an opinion so that
[36:43] we can reflect on it uh in our own
[36:45] personal ways but we could by Revelation
[36:48] actually be able to say you know the
[36:51] Jesus didn't just say this but these are
[36:53] our words these are our words tonight
[36:56] that uh
[36:58] he has uh come and we believe that we're
[37:00] in the father and the father is in us
[37:03] and and uh we believe the words that
[37:06] have been spoken to us and they're not
[37:08] of ourself we're not speaking words that
[37:10] is our words when we talk about you know
[37:13] being Victorious or an overcomer or any
[37:15] language like that we could never say I
[37:18] did that myself but it's actually the
[37:20] father in me that has come and has
[37:23] enabled me to do this now we could come
[37:26] at this point right now and the devil
[37:27] would say well but you still make
[37:29] mistakes but my brother and sister God
[37:32] said it's finished and he said it's
[37:34] perfect and we just have to sit back and
[37:36] say you know what this is the truth I I
[37:38] believe these words that come from my
[37:40] lips that that I'm a Son of God that I'm
[37:43] a daughter of God that I'm going to be
[37:45] victorious in this Christian walk I I'm
[37:49] not as one man put it he said God didn't
[37:51] call me out here to be Canon fod for the
[37:54] devil and so it's there that we stand up
[37:56] and we stand upon the word and we
[37:58] believe that and you know it comes down
[38:01] and I I I didn't know any way but I'll
[38:03] just kind of Spill the Beans a little
[38:05] bit tonight uh real quick here uh you
[38:09] know I say unto you verse 12 he that
[38:12] believeth on me the works that I do
[38:14] shall he do also and Greater Works than
[38:17] these shall he do because I go unto my
[38:19] father now my brother and sister when it
[38:22] is greater some people have interpreted
[38:25] that that this bride is going to uh have
[38:28] a Ministry that would outshine Jesus
[38:30] Christ but this is not so it is a
[38:33] greater work my brother and sister for
[38:35] the word to become manifested in you and
[38:37] I and prophecy in word form is wonderful
[38:41] can we say Amen to that to see the word
[38:43] in word form but how much greater it is
[38:46] when the word form becomes living form
[38:49] amen that we come to the place that we
[38:51] are standing here today living the very
[38:54] words that Jesus spoke and that is a
[38:57] greater form we won't go into that it's
[38:59] actually a very broad topic uh a lot to
[39:02] it but my brother and sister The Works
[39:04] that Jesus did he overcome he spoke the
[39:07] word he was the word made flesh all of
[39:10] these attributes that we can attribute
[39:12] to our lord Jesus and he said that we're
[39:15] going to come and we're going to do that
[39:16] in this day in an age that's dark a age
[39:20] that is ugly age that is so deceptive
[39:23] and yet we're going to come and live out
[39:25] every word that our lord Jesus
[39:27] prophesied every word that the apostles
[39:30] prophesied every bit of this through the
[39:32] Old Testament that was prophesied we get
[39:35] the privilege and let's focus on that
[39:37] word for a moment it is not we are just
[39:40] here and are obligated or anything
[39:42] attached it is a privilege this gift of
[39:46] life in this age that God has given us
[39:49] is clearly a privilege of the uh gift
[39:52] he's given amen and I say thank you Lord
[39:55] because verse 13 my brother and sister
[39:58] now I believe we have testimonies
[40:00] amongst us but I I think that we should
[40:03] be looking into a a greater portion of
[40:06] this to ask the Lord not for an evidence
[40:09] for our own self but as it would be that
[40:11] we would have a greater understanding in
[40:13] Revelation to live out the word and he
[40:16] said whatsoever ye shall ask in my name
[40:19] I don't know about each one of you but
[40:21] there's been times in my life that I
[40:23] won't elaborate because of time but
[40:26] there's been times in my my life that I
[40:28] in desperation cried out to God and
[40:31] sometimes I know I've shared to the
[40:33] church here at time in my youth with a
[40:35] pickup on on a slick Road and over in
[40:38] the edge of a canyon and one Little Rock
[40:40] holding a vehicle up my brother and
[40:42] sister I tell you today whatsoever you
[40:46] ask in his
[40:49] name do we have the faith to apply that
[40:52] amen see that should be really not to
[40:55] become a Doctrine my brother and sister
[40:57] unfortunately Humanity always wants to
[40:59] make things a Doctrine but this should
[41:01] be a Cornerstone of our life to know
[41:04] with confidence and stand in that to
[41:07] move forward that whatever we ask that
[41:10] he will answer it amen that he will do
[41:14] and so it's there he turns around and
[41:16] repeats it again in verse 14 if you ask
[41:20] anything in my name I will do it amen
[41:23] now don't misunderstand me tonight
[41:25] because I'm not talking about playing
[41:26] some kind of mind game with the Lord cuz
[41:29] we don't do that but I I want to
[41:32] challenge you to take that and apply
[41:35] that that I have full expectation if I
[41:38] ask for the right
[41:40] reasons now what we're asking my brother
[41:44] and
[41:45] sister is not for temporal things we're
[41:47] not asking for carnal things but yet I
[41:51] think Brother Rich cob uh has a
[41:54] testimony of his childhood that uh they
[41:57] were in very Dire Straits as a family I
[41:59] think many of you have heard this
[42:01] testimony haven't you and and brother
[42:04] Rich's dad says you you kids write down
[42:06] what it would be like what you would
[42:08] want uh for for food and whatever and I
[42:11] remember Brother Rich you know with just
[42:13] the way brother rich is he he says you
[42:15] know and I just love that thick sliced
[42:18] bacon and he says so I specifically
[42:21] wrote that down and not just bacon but I
[42:24] want thick sliced bacon and as they are
[42:27] praying over these things there's a
[42:30] knock on the door a and uh Brother
[42:32] Richard senior doesn't quit praying but
[42:35] when they're finished they go to the
[42:36] door and there's no one there but bags
[42:39] of groceries and everything they had
[42:42] placed on that list was there am my
[42:45] brother and sister we know Brother Rich
[42:48] sister charity right we're not talking
[42:50] about people that are flighty and and
[42:52] just go with a good story we're talking
[42:54] about solid Believers and yet Brother
[42:56] Rich always gets just this little Glee
[42:59] in there he goes and there was that
[43:03] thick sliced bacon and he said I was so
[43:06] happy but then his dad being faithful
[43:09] turned around and says now how could
[43:12] this be that before we even done praying
[43:14] for it God's answered it oh my brother
[43:19] and sister how we should have that kind
[43:20] of confidence maybe not just always for
[43:23] thick sliced bacon but it's time that we
[43:25] come to a place that we say I have a
[43:27] need in my own life I have a need in my
[43:29] family my children somewhere an extended
[43:32] family we have a need in the body of
[43:34] Believers it's time for us to take God
[43:36] at his word and step out and say he said
[43:39] it and I am a Son of God and his jeans
[43:42] amen the very lifeblood of the token is
[43:45] flowing in me and so therefore I have
[43:48] the confidence to step up and say Lord
[43:50] I'm asking in your name now I have
[43:53] expectation and God is faithful Can
[43:56] someone say Amen into that
[43:59] Hallelujah you know sometimes you you
[44:02] interact with with people uh that are
[44:05] not even Christians you might I don't
[44:06] know uh I don't know how to classify
[44:09] them maybe we'll just for the sake of
[44:11] the conversation say they're agnostics
[44:14] or atheists or something of that nature
[44:17] and they'll ask you a question like so
[44:19] okay Paul you you believe God's right
[44:21] here prove
[44:22] it my brother and sister could we
[44:25] actually this evening
[44:28] pull some proof out of our
[44:31] pocket and lay it down before a agnostic
[44:34] or an atheist and say this is my proof
[44:36] of being a
[44:39] Christian
[44:41] no it's no wonder this
[44:44] world is tipping in the balance because
[44:48] they want proof now I want to ask you
[44:51] guys tonight do we have proof that we're
[44:53] Christians absolutely it's not something
[44:56] that you know just uh tangible to the
[45:00] unbeliever but we have proof within
[45:02] ourself because it comes as it would be
[45:05] in the form of faith and because God has
[45:08] proven himself over and over and over
[45:10] and over again we have numerous answered
[45:13] prayers we have healings we have
[45:15] deliverances we have all of this and for
[45:18] the believer we look at that and say
[45:20] that's proof I don't need anything else
[45:22] I I don't need some some you know
[45:25] evidence that could go to the Supreme
[45:26] Court court because uh the real Supreme
[45:30] Court has already declared it to be
[45:32] truth amen and so as we look at this we
[45:35] live in such a a age of limbo that that
[45:40] to the unbeliever they're looking for
[45:43] something as it is that they could pick
[45:45] up and could hold and examine and that
[45:49] would be their proof but yet in The
[45:51] Believer now that man that spoke to
[45:53] brother Bram says I just can't believe
[45:55] that and brother bram's resp response
[45:57] was not not being snarky not being
[46:00] disrespectful but he says yes that's
[46:02] right because it's only for believers
[46:06] and we're here tonight as Believers
[46:08] believing that our God answers prayers
[46:10] and we have real tangible evidence amen
[46:15] now the court of the world won't accept
[46:17] that but as we said here and we would
[46:19] say how would I prove uh I I'm a
[46:22] Christian would it be by attending
[46:25] church no
[46:28] would it be by we confess that we're
[46:32] Christians would it be a certain action
[46:35] that we sing and shout and
[46:39] dance all of these are
[46:42] true they're all part of a picture
[46:45] they're all part of the overall and so
[46:48] it is it still comes down that the proof
[46:52] that the world's looking for you may or
[46:55] may not produce
[46:57] because we'll be shocked and I I don't
[46:59] want to really go into naming names but
[47:01] there's still even in this day
[47:03] Ministries out here that are having
[47:06] healings and
[47:08] deliverances and all of the things that
[47:10] are considered the signs of it being
[47:13] truth but we look at this my brother and
[47:16] sister it's not uh uh that we have these
[47:19] things that I named off you know we're
[47:21] we're faithful in church we should be we
[47:24] should be faithful in church amen and we
[47:27] should be confessing Jesus Christ as
[47:29] Lord and Savior amen and there will be
[47:32] certain actions or lack of certain
[47:35] actions that will show that God is
[47:37] dealing with us and as you do you know
[47:40] you look at these things and and um
[47:43] there's a man I've known for many many
[47:45] years and and I hope you catch why I'm
[47:47] sharing this uh this man um done quite a
[47:51] bit of business with him through the
[47:52] years and and he was having health
[47:54] problems goes to the doctor the doctor
[47:57] says you have lung cancer and they said
[48:00] and we we you you quit smoking entirely
[48:02] it will extend your life a period of
[48:05] time uh uh and if you don't uh we
[48:08] believe you'll be dead within 6 months
[48:10] and so he quits smoking changes a lot of
[48:13] things and he goes back in a year or
[48:16] he's back in there a year later and he
[48:18] asked the doctor he said you know uh am
[48:21] I better and the doctor said no you you
[48:25] misunderstand you you're never getting
[48:29] better we're just trying to extend your
[48:32] life and he said if this is not going to
[48:36] change me I'm going back and he went
[48:39] right back to a chain smoker died just a
[48:41] few days
[48:42] ago now my brother and sister you look
[48:45] at that and let me turn this into a
[48:48] spiritual
[48:50] aspect sometimes we serve God because we
[48:52] think he's going to make everything
[48:54] better and when he doesn't make it
[48:58] better we start to revert
[49:01] back but what God says is I want you to
[49:05] believe whether you see a difference in
[49:08] the physical body I want you to believe
[49:11] if you still have doubts I want you to
[49:13] believe if you still have fear I want
[49:15] you to
[49:16] believe if you still have weakness in
[49:19] your flesh uh those besetting I want you
[49:22] to
[49:23] believe because it's not a matter of
[49:26] what the flesh says but it's what the
[49:27] soul claims what the position the soul
[49:31] is in and when I say claim it's not just
[49:33] claim it you know name it and claim it
[49:35] but it's still the seed that's in there
[49:38] and so it's there that sometimes these
[49:41] these parts are just part of a bigger
[49:43] picture and and I I as I was studying or
[49:47] thinking through on this you know how
[49:49] many times he that
[49:51] believeth right sister now you have
[49:54] there's a voice of the Prophet now
[49:56] sister you have
[49:58] this and if you'll
[50:00] only
[50:03] believe did he promise them long life
[50:06] did he promise them anything no but he's
[50:09] talking about rebuking a spirit of
[50:11] cancer or or depressions or what and and
[50:14] he's attaching that to believing and
[50:18] then critics say well they went from
[50:20] there and nothing
[50:23] changed must have been the prophet's
[50:25] fault
[50:28] no he was only in that
[50:31] intermediary it was actually God
[50:33] speaking amen people think oh if you if
[50:36] you just believe that's what that's what
[50:38] brother brandham said if you'll just
[50:40] believe my brother and sister that was
[50:42] God talking to them telling them if you
[50:44] can just have enough faith in my word
[50:47] then I will come on the scene but the
[50:50] truth is my brother and sister many
[50:52] times people their faith is temporary
[50:55] I've been there I can tell you it's a
[50:56] truth your faith is temporary and and
[50:59] Circumstance then comes between you and
[51:01] the word and and you revert right back
[51:05] if it's not going to change me
[51:07] immediately then I I just fall back to
[51:09] where I was before and you see what
[51:12] we're looking at is proving the word my
[51:15] brother and sister how do we prove the
[51:17] word do we have a whole list of
[51:20] actions you know many years ago there
[51:22] was some brothers pastors that would
[51:25] have a ledger you might say or book in
[51:27] the in their church and they were
[51:29] faithful to
[51:30] record every answered prayer every
[51:34] Deliverance every healing they
[51:36] Faithfully wrote it down as a record and
[51:39] that's wonderful but when you handed
[51:41] that record to someone who didn't
[51:43] believe it didn't mean one thing to them
[51:47] but when you handle handed the record to
[51:51] a Believer they would open that and they
[51:54] would go oh I remember when this sister
[51:57] got healed oh I remember when this young
[52:00] man got saved oh I remember and it
[52:03] stirred hard and Faith rose up and
[52:05] they're like praise God but it took
[52:08] something more than just a
[52:12] record it took an
[52:15] anointing it took a
[52:17] seed and someone that said I
[52:20] believe I
[52:25] believe these seems
[52:27] small but you know this incredible
[52:31] action that God does you know it's not
[52:33] necessarily seen by the
[52:35] eye we look out here and someone comes
[52:38] to the
[52:42] altar when we were on our little trip up
[52:45] in Canada there was a brother come to
[52:48] the
[52:49] altar felt led to go down and pray with
[52:51] him I didn't have any great overwhelming
[52:55] inspiration to declar to the world that
[52:58] praise God whatever your need is it's
[53:00] going to happen I just prayed Lord here
[53:02] he is Father his family circumstances
[53:05] Lord you know I don't have a clue but
[53:07] I'm binding my faith with this brother
[53:10] later the pastor told me he says it's
[53:13] actually a miracle he even came down to
[53:16] the
[53:20] altar did he have to get up and jump and
[53:22] shout and run
[53:24] away no but I got to visit with this
[53:27] brother just and he he didn't really
[53:29] share the whole picture to me but he
[53:31] shared part of the picture and my
[53:33] brother and sister it'd be something
[53:34] that was a heavy burden upon a man and
[53:38] yet he said I got up from there and he
[53:41] said I just
[53:42] knew in the end I would be
[53:45] victorious I knew God would answer this
[53:48] need you
[53:50] know we just call that something simple
[53:54] would have been better if a leg would
[53:55] have been lengthened or or something
[53:57] like that no I tell you my brother
[53:58] sister in the world we live in and Satan
[54:01] and his influence that's a miracle when
[54:04] a man goes to an altar wondering do I
[54:06] just quit what do I do nothing's
[54:08] changing and gets up from that altar
[54:10] saying you know what this is all going
[54:12] to work out just fine amen so what are
[54:15] we looking what is the proof of being a
[54:18] Christian God answers every
[54:21] prayer
[54:23] No in fact it might ought to make you
[54:25] nervous if God answers every
[54:30] prayer because our ways my brother and
[54:33] sister the scripture says sometimes they
[54:35] just
[54:37] Wicked you know it it's there that we
[54:41] don't always have the best
[54:43] judgment and if God just answered that
[54:45] prayer and we would say yep there it is
[54:48] but you see sometimes God lets us labor
[54:50] through things amen I know that the Lord
[54:53] does that for me and and you labor
[54:55] through that and by the time you get to
[54:57] where you would say you haven't answered
[54:59] prayer your perspective of the whole
[55:01] situation has changed entirely you know
[55:04] it's not even the same desire upon your
[55:07] heart they not the same reflection on
[55:09] the word and God has done that he knew
[55:11] that by laboring with that so it's not
[55:15] necessarily something that's seen with
[55:16] the eye but in the finished work it is
[55:18] seen by
[55:21] all that every one of us are not the
[55:23] same
[55:24] person the you of 10 years ago is not
[55:27] the you of today and the you of Tomorrow
[55:30] will not be the you of today my brother
[55:33] and sister God is an ontime prayer
[55:37] answering God and so just ask you just
[55:41] my le do any of you ever kind of get
[55:44] bombarded and start to feel like maybe
[55:46] you're misunderstood and maybe you're
[55:49] not really a Believer after all cuz
[55:54] surely it wouldn't be so hard if I'm a
[55:56] Son of God it wouldn't be so
[55:59] hard but the scripture speaks very
[56:03] plainly that if we don't receive
[56:05] correction we're bastard
[56:07] children and it is that as of In the
[56:11] Flesh as we would ask we would ask a
[56:15] miss and God is doing that not to cause
[56:19] us to doubt who we are but to temper us
[56:23] like fine steel to be able to deal with
[56:27] the things of this world the Temptation
[56:29] the trial the struggle all of that is
[56:32] here and and when God is using that we
[56:34] know for a fact we can see out of
[56:36] scripture that God tests with time and
[56:39] there is many people that are good
[56:41] people still living good moral lives
[56:43] that have quit being Christians because
[56:46] it should have all happened by now and
[56:49] the scripture deals with that also and
[56:52] so as we look at that that how God is
[56:54] testing us in every way and form now
[56:59] some brothers we were talking the other
[57:01] day and you know when you think about it
[57:04] you can purify Gold by extreme
[57:09] heat and you can also purify Gold by
[57:13] folding it over and pounding it and
[57:16] folding it over again and pounding it
[57:19] tonight I say this with humor so you all
[57:21] look at this who wants to be
[57:24] purified amen you're either going to
[57:26] have some fiery trials or you're going
[57:29] to get
[57:30] pounded but the end is you'll be pure
[57:34] and that's what God's looking for and so
[57:37] let's be careful not to look at one and
[57:39] say wow they're going through the fire I
[57:40] wonder what's wrong with them maybe we
[57:43] should say they're going through the
[57:44] fire praise God look what's right with
[57:48] them amen and they getting pounded over
[57:51] here and you say wow you know I wonder
[57:54] see like joob what's the secret sin but
[57:56] maybe God's folding them over and the
[57:59] last time he folds them over he can
[58:01] declare they're pure gold amen it's all
[58:05] in our
[58:06] perspective I know that in my own flesh
[58:09] Saints I'll just say this when the
[58:11] pounding comes I often start looking for
[58:14] what did I do wrong what did I do wrong
[58:16] but maybe God wants us to stop and say
[58:18] praise God I'm being pounded amen it's
[58:21] for the benefit and the glory of God
[58:24] Amen I don't want to come before god
[58:26] with a dull image I want to come as pure
[58:29] gold with his
[58:32] reflection Amen Let me hurry along here
[58:35] so we don't get too too stretched out in
[58:38] Luke 8
[58:40] 5-11 the scriptures talking about I'll
[58:42] just preach it instead of reading it all
[58:45] the the scripture is talking about a
[58:47] sewer went out sewed seed and some fell
[58:49] by the wayside and it gets trod down
[58:52] fouls of the air some fell on rocks and
[58:55] and uh it was wasn't the right
[58:56] conditions and it Withers uh some fell
[58:59] amongst thorns and Thorns sprang up
[59:01] choked it other fell on good ground and
[59:04] sprang up and bear fruit a h hundredfold
[59:07] now look at this my brother and sister
[59:09] we'll look at this and realize as we
[59:11] know as a parable this is not
[59:14] dirt that they're talking about this is
[59:18] a condition of the
[59:20] Soul amen we can be hard and Rocky
[59:23] bitter whatever that might be we can be
[59:26] in a position where everyone has done us
[59:29] wrong we be in a position where nothing
[59:32] in our life is going good and all of
[59:35] those rocks that are there that we are
[59:38] are stumbling and struggling over will
[59:41] actually choke the presence of God the
[59:43] word out of our life because what
[59:45] Springs up is bitterness and so as we
[59:48] let bitterness spring up bitterness
[59:50] feeds
[59:52] bitterness amen they say that the more
[59:55] that we we uh uh fall under that
[59:58] anointing of bitterness brother Lonnie
[1:00:00] Jenkins talked about this many years ago
[1:00:02] did research on it that people that have
[1:00:05] that Spirit end up with more disease and
[1:00:08] sickness and and those kind of things uh
[1:00:12] mental and physical and and so look at
[1:00:15] that correlation no wonder Satan it
[1:00:17] wouldn't be just to break a relationship
[1:00:19] here and there but Satan's also
[1:00:21] destroying the very individual that's
[1:00:24] carrying that atmosphere
[1:00:26] and so you look how clever Satan is that
[1:00:29] this seed falling in the roadside
[1:00:32] amongst the rocks and the Thorns my
[1:00:35] brother and sister it not only affects
[1:00:37] those around them it kills them right
[1:00:41] certainly kills a word in their life
[1:00:44] amen and the good ground of the Soul uh
[1:00:47] the seed Springs up and bears fruit now
[1:00:51] my brother and sister I want you to
[1:00:53] understand that this is all the same
[1:00:55] seed so as it is God did not have a
[1:00:58] special seed for you or I and everyone
[1:01:02] else gets a seed that's that's uh going
[1:01:04] to be less than
[1:01:07] 100% you know when we plant seed in the
[1:01:11] spring we we to adjust a planter you
[1:01:14] have a bushel weight cup that you
[1:01:17] measure it with and let me just tell you
[1:01:20] in the natural not all seed is equal
[1:01:28] and I hope you follow me because I don't
[1:01:29] want to sound like I'm contradicting
[1:01:32] myself but in the spiritual not all seed
[1:01:37] is equal
[1:01:39] right the seed that God drops into the
[1:01:42] heart soul of the bride of
[1:01:44] Christ is a pure seed amen it's vibrant
[1:01:48] it's
[1:01:49] strong it's got if I could put it to you
[1:01:52] in Farmer terms it's got enough starch
[1:01:56] when that Sprouts it's got enough starch
[1:01:59] to push it up out of the darkness into
[1:02:02] the light
[1:02:05] amen and then we as Sons and Daughters
[1:02:07] of God say wow thank you Lord how did I
[1:02:11] ever come out of that past life it's
[1:02:13] because that seed was the right seed for
[1:02:16] the right soil in the right season under
[1:02:19] the right conditions and if you want to
[1:02:22] get technical and Agronomy we could keep
[1:02:25] going on to the right right right what
[1:02:28] is right what is right what is right
[1:02:30] what is right and can we say tonight
[1:02:32] praise God we have come under the right
[1:02:34] condition to be Sons and Daughters of
[1:02:37] God and rise up with the word bringing
[1:02:39] forth life in us but it's not about just
[1:02:41] bringing forth the life all through the
[1:02:43] scripture The Parables also type that
[1:02:45] that seed must bring forth of its own
[1:02:48] kind and we often look at that is to
[1:02:50] judge well okay if that seed is this it
[1:02:53] must bring this seed but if it was good
[1:02:55] seed in the soil it must be good seed
[1:02:57] that is reproduced right cuz good seed
[1:03:01] will not if everything is done correct
[1:03:03] which is under the leadership of the
[1:03:04] Holy Spirit if it's done correct it's
[1:03:06] not going to bring shriveled seed it's
[1:03:08] going to bring good seed amen good seed
[1:03:12] has that ability to come up out of that
[1:03:15] now my brother and sister not to sound
[1:03:17] like I'm contradicting the word but if
[1:03:20] you plant real good seed you can plant
[1:03:22] it in less than ideal conditions and it
[1:03:25] will still reproduce itself you plant
[1:03:27] shriveled seed in ideal conditions and
[1:03:31] it will not reproduce
[1:03:33] itself amen see how God's working
[1:03:36] through you and I amen so how do we come
[1:03:39] and prove we're Son of God a daughter of
[1:03:42] God called before the foundation of the
[1:03:44] world how do we prove
[1:03:47] it drink and grow drink and grow drink
[1:03:54] and grow that could be very repetitious
[1:03:56] sermon couldn't it drink and grow you
[1:04:00] see we're not trying to outgrow someone
[1:04:03] you know what I mean it'd be like
[1:04:04] sitting there as long as I'm more
[1:04:06] spiritual than they
[1:04:08] are then they they got nothing to do
[1:04:10] with your equation it's all for you and
[1:04:12] I how do we prove we drink and we grow
[1:04:17] and if we don't drink we don't grow and
[1:04:19] if we drink and don't grow we still have
[1:04:21] a problem see it's got to all come
[1:04:23] together and be balanced and so as we
[1:04:26] look at this amen as it is in verse 11
[1:04:29] the parable is this the seed is the word
[1:04:31] of
[1:04:32] God the very same word would touch one
[1:04:34] man and change his life and make another
[1:04:37] man
[1:04:38] bitter but by God's grace tonight I
[1:04:42] think we can lift a hand and say thank
[1:04:44] you Lord The Good Seed has come to the
[1:04:46] soil and we have been blessed by the
[1:04:49] water of the word and the presence of
[1:04:52] the son and it's caused us to come forth
[1:04:55] and how do we know that it's good seed
[1:04:58] because its life will grow and reflect
[1:05:02] it one wheat doesn't grow up and say I'm
[1:05:06] taller than
[1:05:08] you or I'm better than you wheat
[1:05:13] produces wheat and good wheat produces a
[1:05:17] Bountiful
[1:05:18] Harvest Amen Let me just hurry along
[1:05:22] here are we doing okay amen John 10 uh
[1:05:30] 24-30 now we're looking at at
[1:05:33] another uh uh interaction that is
[1:05:37] showing uh of uh the correct seed the
[1:05:40] correct life uh a approving of the word
[1:05:45] then came the Jews round about him Jesus
[1:05:47] and said unto him how long Dost thou
[1:05:49] make us to doubt if thou be the Christ
[1:05:52] tell us
[1:05:53] plainly so we're seeing that the word
[1:05:56] and the action and the
[1:05:58] display is in front of them a and uh
[1:06:02] they're they're wanting to know we need
[1:06:04] you to tell us plainly but Jesus answers
[1:06:08] them and says I told
[1:06:11] you see they're still looking for
[1:06:14] confirmation and Jesus is standing there
[1:06:16] saying I already told
[1:06:19] you so they did not have that ability to
[1:06:23] receive what was spoke
[1:06:26] and Jesus comes down and pariz this in a
[1:06:29] way and and uh you know so they're
[1:06:32] sitting there saying um you know we need
[1:06:34] proof is really what they're saying I
[1:06:36] need some proof of what you said is
[1:06:39] really the fact Jesus said I told you
[1:06:41] and you believed it not the works that I
[1:06:43] do in my father's name they bear witness
[1:06:46] of me now let's deviate for just a
[1:06:48] moment here every one of us is bearing
[1:06:51] witness correct and let's not look at
[1:06:54] the Flesh and say I I've feel like this
[1:06:56] and I feel like that or I feel they and
[1:06:58] that my brother and sister every one of
[1:07:00] us has a struggle every one of us if
[1:07:02] someone looked at our life too closely
[1:07:04] would realize there's there's still
[1:07:05] faults there there's still struggle
[1:07:08] there there's still there but what God
[1:07:10] is doing in in spite of that is making
[1:07:13] us
[1:07:14] witnesses that he chose
[1:07:21] amen we were visiting sister Jerry and I
[1:07:23] today remember the little story in you
[1:07:25] know the man's carrying his cross and he
[1:07:28] tells the Lord I I can't bear this cross
[1:07:31] any longer I I need a I need a lighter
[1:07:34] cross and he goes in there and sets his
[1:07:37] cross down and goes around and comes in
[1:07:39] the other door you're familiar with it
[1:07:41] and looks in the room in the smallest
[1:07:43] cross in the room and he picks it up and
[1:07:44] the Lord speaks to him and says that was
[1:07:47] your
[1:07:49] cross but you know if he had picked a
[1:07:52] greater
[1:07:53] cross he'd have still been able to bear
[1:07:57] it God didn't bring us here for us to
[1:07:59] fail he didn't bring us here to reject
[1:08:02] us and if he's called us to a big cross
[1:08:05] he'll give us the ability to carry a big
[1:08:08] cross and if we're called to a little
[1:08:11] cross a small cross not so
[1:08:15] weighty well instead of complaining
[1:08:17] about the weight of that cross maybe we
[1:08:19] should thank God and pray for the guy
[1:08:21] who's carrying the big
[1:08:23] cross but let's understand
[1:08:26] this sometimes that cross that we think
[1:08:28] is so
[1:08:29] little is all that individual can bear
[1:08:34] that's right and they are proving
[1:08:36] themsel in God's eyes by bearing that
[1:08:39] cross just as much as this brother or
[1:08:42] sister is proving in God's eyes by
[1:08:45] bearing a much heavier cross you see
[1:08:48] it's all about who we are and God's
[1:08:51] chosen plan for us and God says I know
[1:08:55] know what you can
[1:08:58] handle and I won't lay anything more
[1:09:01] upon you that's right amen I think it
[1:09:04] would do us well to remember that now
[1:09:06] Jesus speaking to him and says I told
[1:09:08] you you didn't believe me and uh uh I
[1:09:11] come and do in my father's name they
[1:09:13] bear witness of me but you believe not
[1:09:16] because you're not my sheep now imagine
[1:09:20] religious guys are saying what's sheep
[1:09:23] got to do with this
[1:09:28] but to you and I we understand perfectly
[1:09:32] the analogy or the breakdown of of sheep
[1:09:34] and you're not my sheep as I said unto
[1:09:37] you my sheep hear my
[1:09:41] voice and I know
[1:09:44] them and they follow me my this is Jesus
[1:09:49] in a nutshell I could in my thought
[1:09:51] tonight just close it down right here my
[1:09:53] brother and sister this is it in the nut
[1:09:55] sh the sheep hear the voice amen there's
[1:09:59] relationship there and they
[1:10:02] follow amen so it's not sheep as it is
[1:10:06] that they heard some
[1:10:09] noise and they went and did what they
[1:10:11] wanted to
[1:10:12] do right but the Sheep once they have
[1:10:15] been
[1:10:16] identified they want to be with their
[1:10:18] Master amen and I give unto them eternal
[1:10:21] life and they shall never perish and
[1:10:23] neither shall any man pluck them out of
[1:10:24] my hand and that ought to give us great
[1:10:27] Assurance right there amen that's
[1:10:29] something worth following and never
[1:10:30] betray us never leave us abandon us amen
[1:10:34] amen My Father which gave them me is
[1:10:37] greater than all and no man is able to
[1:10:39] pluck them out of my father's hands I
[1:10:42] and my father are one amen you see my
[1:10:46] brother and sister they had enough
[1:10:49] spiritual vision to see and even look at
[1:10:53] that and say are you the Christ
[1:10:57] so they weren't entirely spiritually
[1:11:03] blind but they just didn't want to
[1:11:06] believe they saw the signs and wonders
[1:11:09] they saw everything that
[1:11:11] happened look at the world we're in
[1:11:13] right now I don't want to get Negative
[1:11:15] here but if you just do some rudimentary
[1:11:18] uh
[1:11:19] um
[1:11:21] investigation you'll find that even
[1:11:23] amongst the denominations they're
[1:11:25] starting to have this grave concern at
[1:11:28] the direction they're going I believe
[1:11:30] that was Massachusetts that a pastor
[1:11:32] back there their denomination has a
[1:11:34] rainbow flag in their church and um this
[1:11:38] pastor stood up and said this absolutely
[1:11:40] against the word and I will not support
[1:11:42] it and in less than a couple hours he
[1:11:45] was no longer a pastor no longer part of
[1:11:47] that denomination no longer allowed to
[1:11:50] associate you see they don't want to
[1:11:53] believe no that's right
[1:11:56] that's and it's not just the rainbow and
[1:11:58] that kind of stuff but this book now
[1:12:01] they're preaching it is just
[1:12:04] ideas you see my brother and sister
[1:12:06] quite a difference between the bride of
[1:12:07] Christ that says this is the absolute
[1:12:09] word of God Amen and we can prove that
[1:12:13] we are Sons and Daughters of God because
[1:12:15] we're willing to take and go where the
[1:12:17] absolute tells us to
[1:12:20] go
[1:12:22] amen but if you're not his sheep
[1:12:26] so on one side we have those that are
[1:12:27] proving they're not sheep and we got
[1:12:30] those on the other side proving they are
[1:12:32] sheep now I want to ask you those that
[1:12:34] were hearing jesus' voice and following
[1:12:36] him you think they walked around and
[1:12:39] said we have the Vindication we're his
[1:12:42] sheep they were following truth that's
[1:12:45] right it was not hey we've got this
[1:12:49] great thing but to them these were the
[1:12:52] words of life amen aren't you glad
[1:12:55] tonight that God is dealing with you and
[1:12:57] I exactly the same pattern we're not
[1:12:59] going out here to prove we are better or
[1:13:02] we're anything but we can stand with
[1:13:05] confidence that we have the words of
[1:13:08] life
[1:13:10] amen you know I could have cut this
[1:13:12] sermon down really really short you know
[1:13:14] and just said hey look just say Amen to
[1:13:17] every word of God and live it and you're
[1:13:18] proving that you are but that wouldn't
[1:13:21] have been no fun would it
[1:13:23] amen maybe I should shouldn't ask that
[1:13:28] question but to bring it to utter
[1:13:30] Simplicity we need to hear we need to
[1:13:32] believe and we need to follow it really
[1:13:34] is much simpler than many people say
[1:13:37] they'll tell you I can't live this well
[1:13:40] my brother and sister just stop
[1:13:43] listen
[1:13:44] believe and follow it really comes down
[1:13:48] fairly simple and on a deeper level my
[1:13:51] brother and sister we come to the place
[1:13:53] you know 1 Corinthians 12 many of you
[1:13:55] will know that scripture wherefore I
[1:13:57] give unto you to understand that no man
[1:13:59] speaketh by the spirit of God calleth
[1:14:01] Jesus a cursed and that no man can say
[1:14:04] that Jesus is the Lord but by the Holy
[1:14:08] Ghost you see how it is that God is
[1:14:11] dealing with you and I now you say
[1:14:13] there's lots of people say that that
[1:14:15] that uh uh we believe that we we agree
[1:14:19] 100% with that uh uh you know we see how
[1:14:23] wonderful the Lord is but we got to
[1:14:25] remember my brother and sister that to
[1:14:28] prove we really believe we have to live
[1:14:32] that
[1:14:33] word and so it's there in that realm
[1:14:36] that the hard work if you want to call
[1:14:38] it that starts easy right sweet in the
[1:14:45] mouth bitter in the
[1:14:48] belly but praise God there's something
[1:14:51] about this bride of Christ real
[1:14:54] Christians in this day God didn't take
[1:14:57] away the bitterness my brother and
[1:14:59] sister he did not say oh you just eat
[1:15:01] the word and everything's just going to
[1:15:03] be so wonderful but he's put something
[1:15:05] in
[1:15:07] us I like to use licorice for an example
[1:15:10] the old licorice root
[1:15:13] licorice some people just like oh that
[1:15:16] stuff is horrible
[1:15:20] tasting now if you don't like it I'm not
[1:15:22] typing this spiritually so don't don't
[1:15:26] but that those that there's something in
[1:15:28] our makeup that you eat that old
[1:15:30] licorice root
[1:15:32] Licorice and the minute you finish the
[1:15:35] one piece you're reaching for another
[1:15:39] and you can say well that's how I feel
[1:15:41] about licorice even now that's because
[1:15:43] you're addicted to
[1:15:46] Sugar so it's the sugar that's calling
[1:15:49] you back yeah but that old licorice root
[1:15:54] if there was something in you that liked
[1:15:57] that that it you just can't stop eating
[1:16:00] it in fact that makes me want to go get
[1:16:04] some but look my brother and sister how
[1:16:06] wonderful the Lord is to us because we
[1:16:08] eat the word now let's be honest with
[1:16:10] each other tonight I every one of us in
[1:16:13] here we eat the word and it brings
[1:16:16] sometimes bitterness it brings that that
[1:16:19] that hard taste that hard thing in our
[1:16:22] life but you'll find yourself going
[1:16:24] right back to the the word again and
[1:16:26] you'll find yourself consuming more of
[1:16:28] it and you deal with it and what it does
[1:16:31] is that word is bringing us to the place
[1:16:34] that because we cannot resist the word
[1:16:37] we consume more and more and more of it
[1:16:39] and does that always take away I had
[1:16:41] somebody here just tell me the other day
[1:16:43] sister Jerry and I fellowshipping with
[1:16:45] this individual and they were talking
[1:16:47] about I'm just stunned that here I am
[1:16:49] after all these years of serving God I
[1:16:52] still sometimes have a temper tantrum
[1:16:56] sound familiar
[1:17:00] anyone would we look at that individual
[1:17:02] and say well you're not a Believer
[1:17:06] yet no what it is they're eating the
[1:17:10] book and God's making it to where they
[1:17:13] recognize the preacher don't have to get
[1:17:15] down there you have a temper
[1:17:18] tantrum they themselves are saying I
[1:17:21] want rid of this I want free from this
[1:17:25] and then I picked up my Bible and was
[1:17:27] reading entirely different scripture in
[1:17:29] a whole different area and there it was
[1:17:30] all over
[1:17:33] again and then I went back to my Bible
[1:17:35] and I ate and there it was again see how
[1:17:39] God's dealing with us he's drawing us
[1:17:41] back to eat the book again and again
[1:17:45] we're not one time read the book
[1:17:48] Christians we eat the book until God has
[1:17:52] completely purged us changed us brought
[1:17:55] us forth
[1:17:58] amen I have a really long quote here
[1:18:03] that I I want to shorten
[1:18:11] so
[1:18:12] amen would be in the uh patmas
[1:18:18] Vision I want to shorten this here
[1:18:28] that's the way the church is the vine
[1:18:31] has been split the limbs have been
[1:18:33] grafted in they grafted in Baptist limbs
[1:18:36] Methodist limbs Presbyterian limbs
[1:18:38] Pentecostal limbs message Limbs and
[1:18:42] those limbs were bearing Baptist
[1:18:43] Methodist Pentecostal and Presbyterian
