things that would kind of bring our spirit down a little bit just kind of dampen but my brother and sister there's something about the presence of the Lord whether it's in the workplace in the car in the House Church wherever it is there you can just feel the burdens breaking away you can feel the change just falling off and finding a liberty amen it's just good to be here this morning to see each one of you I say God bless you visitors but there is no visitors in the kingdom of God We are family amen and I'm glad praise the Lord but God bless you those that are here with us and uh we have uh happy to see brother Steve and Sister Sarah back God bless you and sister Carol it has been a long long time God bless you amen such beautiful memories good times it's just good amen let's turn in our Bibles this morning I want to speak to you on a title of accepted and the Beloved and uh you know it's it's good sometimes you know we just find ourselves um you know just caught in a thought and you know you just kind of seem to to just find something in there that that attracts you that speaks to your heart before I get too much further I just want to give you a greetings from the Ashdown family um you know uh they just like we miss Idaho so I don't know if they missed the dirt out here that we call Idaho or they're missing you the Saints but anyway they send their greetings and um uh youth service this coming Friday uh the um uh Grace kids would be at brother Sergey and sister Julia's house and um then uh the young people will be here at the church amen and then I forgot to call you back brother Sergey but um I'm I'm assuming we're still good the Bible study at 5 o'clock this coming Sunday at brother Sergey and sister yulia's house and they're so gracious to open their home and and do that so just let's do something special for them maybe bring a little something so the burden's not all on them uh and uh maybe help clean up the mess and um I'll volunteer sister Jerry uh to help with those things uh but anyway we look forward to that and I I apologize Saints you know we got so busy going to Europe and all the things that have happened that we have not we kind of dropped the ball on Bible study but by God Grace we get back in the cycle and uh have those on a regular on a regular basis amen so I think we did announce about brother Ben uh his okay yeah uh we were fellowshipping with brother Ben last night when he received a phone call uh that his uncle had passed away and so uh certainly want to remember uh the um uh family and all of that amen 2 Corinthians the 5th chapter verses 1-9 this really encouraged me when I read this Saints because uh we put so much value on this Earthly vessel here we put so much value on on this house here uh but to put the right perspective to approach it in the right way certainly this is a temple of the Holy Ghost this is a tabernacle God chose to dwell in in this day on the Earth but at the same token all this is is a shell that carries our soul right amen it is just the transportation as it were and um I I find it kind of cute I'm an analogy person as you well know but when you hear someone else with a good analogy you know you're like yep I like that and they they brought this down in this sense that um uh this body is just like a a transport for our soul and the older the car gets the more maintenance it needs and I thought yeah isn't that the truth the more it needs but the other side of it is it's carried us this far to the Lord and it will carry us all the way Amen to the presence of God Amen that it just harnesses death to take us into the presence of God some people get nervous about that but actually as a Believer our hearts Rejoice to know that we are one day closer Amen to the Lord to the presence of the Lord and um that should make us really happy that should make us excited amen you know uh you think about uh if you were given the opportunity to go back in time what time would it be and I just shared this with the young adults this morning um from quite a young age until my mid-30s I was very foolish so I don't want to go back from 15 to 34 those were my foolish years and I go back and look at that and face some of the struggles that we faced through those years do I want to revisit them I don't think so I think today is the day to praise the Lord today is a day to serve him with all of our hearts because today is the day that the Lord has given to you and I and I say let's just rejoice in that second Corinthians 5 1-9 for we know that if our Earthly House of this Tabernacle were dissolve we have a building of God a house not made with hands Eternal in the heavens for in this we grown earnestly Desiring to be clothed upon with our house which is from Heaven if so be that being clothed we shall not be found naked for we that are in this Tabernacle do groan being burdened not for that we would be unclothed but clothed upon that mortality might be swallowed up of life now he that hath brought rought us uh for the self-same thing is God who also hath given unto us the earnest of the spirit aren't you glad you got that down payment and if we think about how glorious it is here under the anointing of the Holy Spirit what it will be in his presence amen hallelujah amen amen given that Earnest or down payment of the spirit therefore we are always confident knowing that whilst we are at home in the body we are absent from the Lord for we walk by faith not by sight we are confident I say and willing rather to be absent from the body to be present with the Lord wherefore we labor that whether present or absent we may be accepted of him Heavenly Father we just ask Lord for your blessing upon this time bless each one father I pray that we can go forth today with the presence of eternal life Lord that portion that you have given to us today May it move us stir us father cleanse Us in the name of Jesus Christ we ask amen you may be seated and so in looking at this scripture my real Focus would be there in verse 9 those last few words we may be accepted of him and all that matters you know to get there as we' look at the Journey of life we're not going to stand there in the presence of the Lord and remember the pain and the sorrow and the struggle of life we're going to just stand there with those words that he will speak to us cherished words well done my good and faithful servant that's going to be where our heart truly finds a rejoicing a Revival is in that presence amen and you know I believe these scriptures here Express the heart's desire of every Christian I believe when the Apostle Paul spoke he was anointed of the Holy Spirit to uh catch the very essence of what our relationship with the Lord means it's not just that we chose to be separated from the world we chose not to partake of their things and and their rituals and their traditions and their ideas but there was something inside of us we didn't place it there we could not place it there but he placed it in us and we are simply a response of the word that was planted in this age here and we would say well we we were Sinners and we were saved but God knew the exact second that that seed would sprout in your life and start to bring forth and so it's there that we realize how perfectly the plan of God is and you know as we look at this we find ourselves maybe when we're young uh uh it is it is maybe a little distant view but as we get older we start to realize truly what this plan of God was for us and how much we cherish that you know uh we we would come and be able to to witness or testify that um I I I don't long for my life to be a vapor but I do long to be in the presence of the Lord I I don't want to say that I would would um my in my flesh especially look forward to passing uh from this life tomorrow but at the same token I know as I pass from this life I pass into eternal life and it's coming into that presence of the Lord that is like the great magnet pulling us forward and Satan well he doesn't have to get us to believe a false Doctrine he doesn't have to get us to do a lot of things he just has to muddy up the water enough to keep us from realizing what our real true call in is amen I I tell you I might sound a little harsh today my brother and sister the church was not called for a Super Bowl party the church was not called for a soup supper and a bingo party and and Bunko and a this and a that and be politically activated the church was called to be a place where Sons and Daughters of God come in and they bring their lick of fire and it turns into a great fire and it has created a spirit where people can can come and cast off the cares and the chains of life and find some Liberty as it is now we should have Liberty without having to come to church but there is something in the essence of coming in the house of God and seeing those you love and joining together with them to sing songs of praise and say Amen to the word amen hallelujah and so it's there that we'll realize the Apostle Paul I believe caught the very essence of that and what our real desire was and the struggle amen of the struggle my brother and sister you think about this and it makes sense naturally but we're more specific to the spiritual but you know in the natural you should be looking to the Future you don't just look to today my brother and sister we look to the Future because you see if you look just to today and today is a day for you then you're going to have your Christian experience marked as a bad experience but when you look to the Future and realize the very seed of God planted in your theophany before the foundation of the world says you're mine and you will be there in my presence you'll be there at the Sea of Crystal you'll be standing Before the Throne you'll worship me for eternity amen you'll realize today is nothing more than a blip of time that's right something that is so little it does not matter now my brother and sister if you don't mind me going off into this little Avenue you know a few years ago I was sitting with my banker and this sounds very carinal please forgive me and catch the spiritual point and and I was saying to the banker you know that I I was a little discouraged because the bottom line had not been changing for several years it it seemed like we were treading water if you understand that term and and uh my banker said you know Paul don't worry about it he said we've done the research as a bank we've done the research and it's between this age and this age that you'll truly make the most money in your life now my brother and sister this sounds like I'm I'm preaching some go Prosperity Gospel to you but I I hope you catch this my brother and sister I hope you catch this he said you know it will be somewhere in your late 40s to early 50s till 66 67 years old you will gain the most wealth that you will ever gain in your life he says so don't get discouraged look to tomorrow and I realize as we go through this life as young people we can have ups and downs we can have struggles and it it seems like Lord I failed you and we get discouraged and I'm not trying to put an age limit but I'm telling you the further you get into this relationship with the Lord the greater the intrinsic value of that relationship comes to you it's not about the ups and downs of our our early experience it's not about the ups and downs of our mid experience but it when it comes to the end of our whether young or old my brother and sister there's where the intrinsic value of this relationship starts to Blossom before us and we start to realize all these years God has been investing in me and now I get to as a mere mortal Express back to him that's right our appreciation for everything he's done and we would not know a good time if we had not experienced a bad time we would not not know healing unless we had been sick am we would not know Salvation unless we realize we've been lost my brother and sister how beautiful this is God the whole time placing this in us and as this intrinsic value starts to grow in us and we go through hard trials you go through a struggle and what God has changed in US is not that we doubt for weeks and months and years whether we're saved or not but we can stop and say Lord your Holy Spirit moved upon me and I know that wasn't the right reaction I know that wasn't the right words I know that wasn't the right attitude forgive me Lord and then we just continue to move on it's no longer a roadblock it is a pause a blip of time that we can say Lord thank you that you love me enough to correct my heart amen chastening my brother and sister is of Great Value it has it has a value like man measur is gold but chastening has that kind of value to Sons and Daughters of God that we could stop and say just a second Lord I need to unload this feeling this emotion this condition I need to just set it aside so that I can move on in the fullness of the revelation of Jesus Christ we talk about the revelation of Jesus Christ my brother and sister but if it doesn't change us we don't have a revelation we cannot go on in our same human behavior and say I've got the Holy Ghost but nothing ever changes because the presence of God will change us it calls Isaiah it caused Isaiah to say take a coal Lord these lips of mine it caused God to speak to Moses and say this is Holy Ground and Moses took his shoes off it takes us my brother and sister to a place that it would be as Joshua coming and he sees a a man as it were before him him he doesn't say well I don't know what I'm going to deal with this I'm just going to move away from this but Joshua is so anointed of who he was what he was called to do he draws his sword and says are you a friend or are you a foe and if we would measure the spirits of leod deia are you a friend or are you a foe our life would be much simpler that's right cuz either moving forward or we're moving back exactly I think it's so wonderful that God is gracious to us I hope you understand me this morning God gives us the ability to measure our relationship with him that's it now this is not for me to say well I'm a spiritual man I'm this I'm that but it's there that God by moving on us anointing us we start to realize and and we realize in the sense that you know what I've got room I got to grow now have you ever had a flower or a plant uh and you you plant that remember young people when we did the little deal with the corn and some you know uh some it just kind of was a a good point that we wanted to make to you but you know some of us we we kept planting our corn into a little bit bigger uh pot and um I took it maybe more serious than some of the young people did but you know you leave that little corn plant by the time he got about that tall we had him in this little pot and finally we decided okay enough of this we're we're kind of done babysitting this corn plant but when we pulled that out of that PO pot uh that little plastic thing the last time I don't know if you'd call it a pot or whatever but we pulled it out of there my brother and sister it was nothing but a mass of roots God never called us to be rootbound Christians he never called us to stay in our little world our our little denomination our little ideology our little thought until we're rootbound amen it was kind of amazing cuz I should have known better being a farmer but you know when we popped that out of there and I looked at that and I I kind of thought to myself where'd the dirt go because this thing was nothing but Roots but you see that plant could have never brought itself to maturity in that environment amen God wants you to spread your wings he wants you to take the word he wants you to step out and say you know what I was called a Son of God I was called as a daughter of God to step into the Rapture not crawl into the Rapture not beg myself into a Rapture not cry myself into a Rapture but stand up as a strong Christian filled with the Holy Ghost and say Satan get behind me I've been called to the Rapture I hear the word I hear the word I hear the word and I'm following the word right cuz we can get root Bound in our own concept of the message we can get root Bound in our own concept of Christianity we can get rootbound my brother and sister in our complex that's exactly right but God said I've set you free and he's been set free is free indeed amen let it go let it reach out take a to these things of the word of God that we can move forward that's right amen if you have an LG appliance the rumor that went through the whole world was that LG stood for life as good when they started that company they didn't think about life is good they just had a purpose but I'm here to tell you life is good amen I'm glad I'm living this morning amen this word that I just read scripture I read to you I want to be in the presence of God I want to stand Before the Throne I want to go and I want to be ready to go but at the same token in our Humanity we hold on to life we cherish it amen and so why don't we make the best of it while we're hereall testify that's it well die just live it that's it your life will testify you don't have to stop we mentioned this to the young adults there you don't have to go out on the corner and tell everybody that goes by if you don't believe you're going to hell I don't know that that's always the right way to present the gospel my brother and sister there's no love there's no Redemption it is more of a fear being struck into the hearts of people I don't want Grace Tabernacle to have fear in their heart I want them to have a joy that they were called to serve god with everything that was within them there shouldn't be a fear other than the reverence of God there should not be fear in us there ought to be Liberty to say Thank You Lord that you wrote my name in the book before the foundation of the world and now I get the privilege to manifest your confidence in me your word in me your life in me I get this privilege to live it out Hallelujah that's right and as much as we'll shout and say Amen to that yes sir we have to turn around and say sometimes it's hard that's sometimes it's a great battle and we wonder could this really be what I was called to but I'm here to tell you this is what God called you to amen there won't be a person standing Before the Throne that has not scars that's right that's exactly wouldn't it be wonderful amen and your testimony brother well I got saved sa D when I was seven and praise God never had a single struggle in my whole Christian experience I'll tell you what the Apostle Paul and a few others would stand up and say you're counterfeit amen that's exactly you're not the real thing because this is a battle this is Warfare amen you're going to have some uh scars of fiery darts you're going to have those times when Satan trying to cut off your relationship with the lord and there might well be scars upon your heart upon your breast that we spe there as Satan tried to put his his uh sword and try to drive it into your heart to cause bitterness to take over but God come on the scene and he says let me put the bomb of Gilead upon you let my spirit be upon you let my life be upon you let healing virtue flow through youall and we rise up once again Amen to walk in the grace of God Victorious amen not as defeated that's it I think the devil didn't want me to preach this I was sitting in my chair this morning and all of a sudden in the room just come this Spirit Paul you're not making a difference you ought to just quit not quit being a Christian man why do I feel this way yeah maybe I'm not appreciated maybe yeah well regardless I I need to finish this sermon and preach it to the Saints this morning do you know the minute I got back in the word that Spirit left that's it that's exactly right Hallelujah the devil just desired to throw a wrench or a roadblock or a brick or whatever it might be realize this Warfare is not flesh and blood it's real my brother and sister amen Spirits moving trying to come finding a resting ground but in the word amen there's no place for the devil that's right in the word he's not comfortable there that's right my I'll tell you the devil is not comfortable not in man's ideas not in man's denomination not in man's interpretation but in the word the devil is not comfortable and he has to leave amen amen oh we don't have to stand up out of our office chair start stomping our feet Satan you're under my feet just get in the word that's it just get in the word and Satan is like it's too hot in here man this is a guy that's going to live in hell and he can be that hot right here yeah preheat Satan they dep picked you was standing there with a pitchfork with flames behind you but I can assure you devil you're not going to like it there that's man's interpretation come on scripture says they threw him in the bottomless pit the fiery pit threw them in there I'm telling you Satan wasn't saying hallelujah I'm going down here into Hades no sir he likes it here on the earth he likes it on Main Street he likes it in the theater he likes it in the dance hall he likes it in the shopping mall yes sir he doesn't want to be throwed in there and he doesn't want to go alone so he's trying to find somebody who's willing that's it to go with him that's right well Satan you're going to have to shop somewhere else amen you're just going to have to go find somebody else that wants to hang out with you now look you think it's okay to express this in church that living out our natural desire it really is who we are right if you don't mind I'm trying to break this habit but it just kind of kind of is hard you know how long I'd last in brother Trevor's Barber Shop how you here s your ear another one I've already cut one head of hair today what do you mean I got to do it again but I don't know how long brother Trevor would last out there at 3.8 mil an hour going down the field might last longer than I think I don't know be hard to judge but you see we have to recogn ize what God called us to in the natural some of you love to cook I love to eat your cooking some of you don't like washing dishes I love creating dirty dishes but you see we we all have this Niche that God's called us to and we can't all be Apostles and we can't all be prophets and we can't all be evangelists and we can't all be pastors but my brother and sister every one of us is necessary for the body of Christ for the kingdom of God to function it takes every single one of us and sometimes what we see as an envil in to Envy a position oh man must be nice I'm here to tell you it's not as nice as you think it is it's not as comfortable as you think it is people call you up and share things that you don't want to hear ask you to act upon things you don't want to act upon amen amen amen but I tell you what it's just as hard if you want to call it that just being a sheep that comes to church that's it faithful that's right week in and week out worship God and think why doesn't the pastor do this that can be difficult can't it come on let's be honest with ourselves not every one of you agree with me some of you can disagree with a smile some of you don't even realize you're frowning that's exactly right but the truth of it is God makes it work amen it's not man it's not this man or that man or this family or that family it's God that can bring a group of people together bring Harmony amongst them bring the liberty of the moving of the Holy Spirit amongst them and we still get to do what we want are you with me yes I feel sorry for people that feel compelled to have to ask the pastor to do everything in their life can I take a vacation can I buy a car should I buy a house now if you're asking to buy the house as in pray with me then I say ask that's right amen but if you want me to make the decision for you amen you might not like my decision amen flee the city move to the country have a chicken have a hog have a calf but some of you say we don't want that well okay do it anyhow I'm the pastor it's not how it works God gives you Liberty to live your life he gives you Liberty to chase your desires amen this not talking of the spiritual this is this flesh man he gives you Liberty to do that and because we love the Lord and believe his word we put him first and somehow it is blessed amen amen even our mistakes it's blessed Hallelujah so look at this now amen we just have to be careful that our thoughts are the Lord's thoughts how many times I hope this doesn't hurt anybody but how many times has Humanity said the Lord told me to do this and this and then in a day week month year 5 years 10 years they're like NOP this is no good Lord oh this might hurt I'm sorry but it's about the Perfect Analogy Lord told me to marry that woman five years later I think she's Anointed with a devil and I tell you what I have got get rid of her so I can go get a real Holy Ghost filled wife wait just a second you you said the Lord told you to marry her five years ago and now she's turned into a devil maybe you helped her that's it maybe you caused it maybe she's not the problem maybe you are the problem you see how we're always looking trying to Shuff will always do but you know what when our thoughts are God's thoughts and God's thoughts are our thoughts when God says I want you to do this or he places someone in our life husband wife you know sometimes I remember a brother and sister one time told me said we just don't understand you know we've been serving the lord since we were teenagers they met just as kids in the church we've been serving the lord since we were just teenagers and and we just lived our whole life and it seems like God allowed the devil to give us children and I thought you know I might not ever preach in this church again so I'm just going to feel free to give advice uh brother if there's devil in your children you brought it in the house that's it amen and it'll be up to you to throw it out that's righten don't be tossing your kids okay I'm sorry your kids are smoking pot and drinking and crawling out the window almost every night and whatever else but I'll tell you what when you become subject to the word they'll become subject to you and the word oh you think so brother Paul no I don't think so you don't I know so I don't need to think it get the garbage out of the house Amen in the message thirst brother Brenham says it's brings it right around whatever you're feeling on that's it oh Lord help us that makes all of us in a way guilty right we all have some little something that you know it might be I remember one time a brother told me he said oh I I don't you know I just don't like to do any questionable things and and you know we sat there in his house and he he had outdoor life filled in stream and whatever and I made some comment and his wife pipes up from the kitchen he doesn't read the Bible I thought Lord I need to pray for that sister's safety but something checked that man amen and he said it's the truth and I got to change yes sir that's it and it wasn't that he got to change he did change that's the beauty of this gospel it took a mouthy I mean I mean a sister uh but you see the truth of it was it was the right words at the right time I don't think we're going to make a doctrine of shaming you into the Rapture but sometimes the truth just has to be spoken sometimes we have to realize Satan is so clever if he can keep us from being accepted in the Beloved that's it right there keep us distracted distracted never tell a lie never lust In the Flesh never have a temper never have any of these things but not in the word that's it Satan's still one Amen to be accepted in the Beloved my brother and sister we need to make sure our thoughts align with the Lord's thoughts amen now I'll give you an example I'm sorry I don't want to keep you too late here I'm burning up time but if if you was you don't need to turn but if you was to turn your Bible to number 23 24 right through that region you'll see there it's this story talking about balam's struggle and trust me my brother and sister it was a struggle for balum balum wanted the position over here but he had enough of God in him he kept going back and asking God but the desire to be accepted and receive the the benefits of that was greater and the more he went back to man's idea the more he went back to what he thought was right amen the farther the word got from him until finally he comes to a place he starts out I won't curse God's people that's right no way I'll curse God's people oh we'll add another you know nicer thing and another thing and another gift and another whatever for you and the more he went back finally God says you know what I know what the desire of your heart is so you know what balam I will not give you permission go back study your Bible God never said go ahead and curse Israel he told him I give you or Grant to you the desire of your heart what is our desire today that's it if the Lord come down today and said I grant to you the desire of your heart Lord I pray it won't be wealth or fame or anything of this world here my brother and sister I pray that the very thing that would come from us would be Lord I want more of you I need more of you Lord I I just need to come Lord let the word correct me bring me in your presence Lord that's exactly right and look where balum ends up same altars same sacrifice same worship that's it same songs mostly because you can sing the same song with a different Spirit that's it and create a entirely different atmosphere that's the truth amen that's right if that wasn't the case you could take some of these country singers and some of these rock singers and whatever that sing Amazing Grace and you could play it in church and create the same atmosphere but you see it wasn't necessarily the music as it was the spirit that's it that's it and when that Spirit anoints them you got Dolly Parton I'm sorry for name and names you got Dolly Parton singing Amazing Grace and How Great Thou Art you've got to rock stars look sorry this some of this is from my youth and sometimes it just crops up you know and I I have to read the article because I I need to make a little connection Alice Cooper is now a Christian and if you don't know who Alice Cooper is well don't go look him up but I'm telling you he doesn't look any different than he did before and doesn't behave much different than he did before but he's now a Christian got religion that's exactly right now what atmosphere will it be when they sing Amazing Grace that's it it will not be the atmosphere that Sons and Daughters of God singing Amazing Grace create in the sanctuary s create in the house in the car wherever it might be so you see how these spirits come in and they anointed and uh balum keeps coming back until God says here I give you the desire of your heart and he goes out there he's got the right altars he's got the right sacrifice he's got all the foundation of Praise but everything behind it was a deception I everything behind it was a curse amen and there was no way when he come back in the presence of God that God would tell him well done that's right not a chance but Israel's problem is Israel stepped out and said well I see in the church ages I see that I see seals I see this I see this it must be what is the spirit behind it that's exact what is moving this now I'm going to get off this real quick but I want to say this If you flew right back into the book of numbers and stood there that day you would not find fault in the mechanics of their worship that's exactly it right there are you with me that's from showing up to church on time pay their tithe doing this and doing that reading their Bible all of these things you wouldn't find fault with the mechanics but my brother and sister the right Spirit was not in it it could never produce what the word said it would produce and so we have to have the mind of God we have to be in the word and in the right Spirit coming in there and when we do that we have seen this how God works in miraculous ways how his presence comes down and moves in our midst what's the difference amen what's the difference some people can't see the difference that's right some people sense there's a difference but don't know why that's right but revelation of the word that's it shows a bride that's right amen a son or daughter of God says look how close they came that's it they came so close but they could not reproduce the word that's oh my brother and sister you can oh I I'll I'll get caught off in analogy here amen hallelujah see so look at that we got to see the difference between man's desire and God's desire once again here the other day got a little text a little deal about how um that um you this is the this is 10 ways you can increase the attendance of your church and uh boy you know of course I just jumped right on that now I don't know who's volunteer but the very first now get this I want you to think about this the very first thing they put up as a way to increase the attendance of the church is to have one of you Brothers out in the parking lot greeting them and giving them the paper that outlines today's service we don't know what's going on one minute to the next I mean I must admit I was disappointed brother Alex didn't submit the song service songs for approval really some of you'll like the next one you should provide coffee and a light dessert my brother and sister do you see where religion has gone yeah it now I've wore this out but I'll wear it out one more time it takes to get you to come to the house of God is what it will take to keep you in the house of God so if we start with the word we can finish with the word we don't have to bring some kind of a gimmick or some kind of a program we'll start with the word and we will finish with the word and the seed that's in Sons and Daughters of God will be attracted to the word and when they hear and get their teeth in the delicacy of that beautiful dessert called the word that's it they will say I'm coming back that's exactly right imagine a Sunday without the donut man well I'll tell you what if that's the way this church is going to be I'm done with them we attended or an event at a church actually that was a funeral wasn't it but it was a regular thing just a different different vendor yeah signs on the door don't eat in the sanctuary Ah that's good words preacher oh I'm out of coffee get up slam the door come back where's a reverence is God going to look down and say Well done you bought the best coffee maker there is you have the best donuts there is well done no my brother and sister God's looking for a heart that comes into the house of God I'm telling you if we had a modern day Tabernacle here you would need to go down to Harbor Freight and buy every inch of rope they had because they would be dragging a lot of people back out of the Tabernacle they would be pulling a lot of people they would get in there in this modern day spirit and they would be there and God would say nope done drag another one out maybe they could recycle the Rope I don't know but you see my brother and sister that no what God's looking for we can build our own altar isn't this wonderful I I I want you to think about this for a minute hope I'm not too straight today we can build our own altar Can someone say thank you Lord I get to build my own altar but I'll tell you the difference between a real believer and somebody who's just claiming it is a real believer goes and says here is the directions for building my altar okay I'm going to do this and I'm going to do this and I'm going to do this and then when we put our sacrifice on the altar God says I accept it but when we build our own altar amen we throw everything we think is beautiful on that Altar and then we offer it to God and wonder why God's not pleased that's right so instead of finding out why God's not pleased we just change the rules of what pleases God so then we come up with a whole new religion of what we think pleases God I say help us Lord help us Lord I want an altar but I want it to be an altar of your desire an altar of your word an altar of your ideas Lord not my ideas now I know none of us ever got caught up in the realm of working for our Salvation except every one of us has at some point in time amen look our labor to build our altar my brother and sister will never get us in no amen we need to lay our altar on God's I mean our sacrifice on God's altar amen amen the reality of it is and I know you'll say Amen to this is all we really want is what the Lord desires that's all that matters to us amen Church attendance I don't know maybe we do make an effort for the church to grow maybe we preach the word boldly yes sir and then we live it that's it and it will attract that's right the believer amen it will attract the Christian because he's not going to look at you know I'm going to name the other ministers here just you know I mean not really throwing them under the bus or anything but you know maybe they'll look at brother David's Ministry they'll look at brother Chris's Ministry and maybe they'll come along and say you know they always just preach so nice except when they don't that's but I need it and I want it imagine a a group of Christians that actually Rejoice at having the hide tore off of them doesn't sound normal does it I think number eight or something is never speak harshly to the people I had to agree with them harsh is not the answer that's it truthful yes is the answer and there is such a difference between harsh that's right and and truthful that's right God help us amen why because we're moving forward my brother and sister to be acceptable in the Beloved that's it this is what God's doing now we're going to have to make this a part too I have just stretched this out too far but look at this my brother and sister Ephesians 1 1-14 amen I believe is is a just a definite uh connection to this and it is there because of the time uh I I'm just going to hurry through this a little bit probably shouldn't probably should just make it part two somewhere down the road but you know Paul we have no doubt that he was an apostle of Jesus Christ and Paul obviously was very successful so I won't name names but there's a man on the internet that is uh been ordained by somebody to point out every other uh uh religion's faults and failures and whatnot and you know I I I bless his heart just bless his heart but my brother and sister you know I thought where where'd this guy come from so I just type his name into the computer and I start looking back where he come from and how that everything that happened and somewhere at the bottom of it was his net worth and uh I I have messed up as a minister I I me I don't know what I did wrong I had no idea that being a preacher was a career path I thought it was a calling and you look at this and he's telling well this guy's a herotic and that guy's a heretic and then I realized that some of these guys he's calling Heretics you know we have very very similar uh beliefs you know and I realize you know what if we ever hit his radar we'd be a heretic yeah and I get up out of my chair in the office and say thank you Lord thank you Lord because the word said we'd be worshiping in the way that they call heresy that's right amen not Conformity that's right heresy that's right my brother and sister if they cannot accept the baptism of the Holy Ghost if they cannot accept baptism in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ if they cannot accept these things that are basic tenants of the scripture and they want to say we're the Heretics I say thank you Lord amen I'm going to just stand with a word no matter what their opinion is or where they put us in their little structure cuz their structure don't matter God structure does and amen and God laid it out very clearly and so we look at this now I want to just hurry up here uh blessed verse three blessed be the God and father of our Lord Jesus Christ who hath blessed us with all spiritual blessings in Heavenly places in Christ now I want to ask you today have you been visiting Heavenly places amen we should be able to lift our hand and say thank you Lord I've been in your word and that's taken me up into Heavenly places we cannot get into Heavenly places we cannot put oursel in Heavenly places it takes the word of God the Holy Spirit moving in us to lift us up out of leod deia I don't want to have religion I want Christ amen I don't want to have an ideology identity over here oh those of you Believers here you you understand what I'm saying I don't need the identity I don't need somebody say he's a True Believer I don't know what your opinion is I don't care what your opinion is Lord I care about your opinion Lord I want to be pleasing to you Lord this man over in this church and that family over there and these people down there they don't matter about my eternal destination they cannot change my destination amen amen Lord I want you to be pleased with me sir Hallelujah sir now imagine if you get a whole group or Church of people that have that desire Lord I just want to please you you'll suddenly find saints come on you'll find yourself in har harmony with everyone around you because you'll all be immersed in the word surrounded by the word filled with the word we won't have a thought we won't have an idea we won't have a concept it'll be the word amen sorry if you're getting excited Hallelujah man imagine a church like that there wouldn't be a single fuss anywhere amen except for which is kind of like the word but just negates everything in front of it we take this flesh everywhere we go exctly right yes sir the Apostle Paul says crucify yourself daily my he was a sick man I mean what's wrong with him no that's a deep deep revelation cuz I tell you what sometimes this old flesh gets up in the morning and it's already to growl bite snarl scratch surprised sister Jerry didn't say hey amen am amen pray for my husband amen but you know before the sun goes down the Lord corrects those Spirits deals with our hearts amen now what about all the feathers we left behind us this why we need the Holy Spirit every moment of every day you all know the feather story right yeah I think everybody knows the feather story yeah so let's go back and pick up the feathers problem is we don't know where we left them some of went here and some of went there and we try to restore Our Testimony we go back and make apologies we do all these things look I'm sorry but there's those feathers we never saw where they landed isn't it much greater Saints this is I'm just preaching my heart to you isn't it much greater if we can get so immersed in the presence of God we don't have to be feather Hunters that's right we don't have to go and remember now who did I say snarl at today who did I especially those of you prone to Road Rage that's going to be really hard to correct that one going to ask have to ask the police for a security camera I need to see every car that drove down the freeway today I need their phone number I need to be able to no my brother and sister but you'll find I hope you see humor in this you'll find how Satan can so anoint us I drive out of the driveway in the morning I can't just drive right out on the road because there's a car coming and I'm annoyed I'm going to have to wait three seconds to pull out on the road who do they think they are this is my road see how Satan can work the worst of it is we take that attitude home at lunch on the telephone to our children the whole time Satan's just sitting over there got a great Belly Laugh look what I did to them today it only took a car on a highway to ruin their day come on you can insert anything you want into that equation amen now I'll just leave that one be amen praise the Lord so having predestinated us into adoption of children by Jesus Christ to himself a good according to the good pleasure of his will see there's where we're at my brother and sister not what we think amen not what we you know look I'm sorry I'll be a little direct visitors forgive me but I'll tell you around the message we have written such definitive mission statements I can fellowship with them if they believe exactly like I do so far I asked the Lord why do I have no friends because no one can see it just like you it's called personal revelation will it lead us all to the same Finish Line it will but some of you I'm going to be truthful are much smarter than the rest of us and you grasp certain things and you see and boy you're looking way out over here and the rest of us got our head down plowing saying okay now Prophet said this okay I see okay I'm going to reach out really far here and others are like I'm going to reach out really far well I don't know about them they got this crazy Revelation they were sharing with the Church Fellowship about how this and this and this I think they're losing it and I heard the pastor say I believe that so it means our pastors lose sing it my brother and sister all that matters is the Finish Line amen when the word is manifested in you and the word is manifested in me it will take us to the exact same spot to hear the exact same words well done my good and and faithful servant White Horse White Cloud just believe he's coming amen we need to have as much grace for one another as we want to have for ourself and when we will come to that stage I'm cutting off a whole bunch of the sermon sorry but when we'll come to that stage my brother and sister we'll look out we'll see a brother and sister and we'll be thinking I don't know where they're going but I will send the holy spirit with them I will ask the Lord to go with them I'll ask the Lord if they're wrong turn them around amen bring them back that's right but I've seen this Mo life though I could testify my life I've looked before and thought you know what I don't I don't know where they're going I don't know where they're going my my oh my where are they going a year later I find myself exactly where they're at just because I couldn't see it didn't mean it wasn't God moving God just matured them a little sooner which is one of the reasons I Marvel that I'm your pastor because many of you are farther down the road than I am and maybe it's just you need somebody to say come on come on and somehow it was me that got put in that place but it doesn't mean that you have to dumb yourself down if I can put it in Blunt words concerning revelation of Jesus Christ because you can't can't have more Revelation than your pastor you remember that was a Doctrine in the message yeah oh my these people are getting revelated around here we're going to have to beat them so that they will get back in line no why don't we just move and join them amen let's rally around the word not the man amen amen a quote where brother Brown says you you should never look up to a man you should only look for an example to Jesus Christ amen if we'll look to Christ as our example my brother and sister then this word will bring each and every one of us into a Rapture that's right Amen to hear those words well done Amen to be accepted in the Beloved is our goal that's it it's not a contest it's not a race it's not something that we have to battle one another it is something we should link our arms together and press to the mark of the High Calling press into the word and encourage one another to press into the word amen I'm I don't mean to drop names but you know we were over at brother Sergey and sister Julia's house the other day and uh you know all the things that happened and whatnot and brother Sergey I really I I just carried that conversation we had home with me and the next day or two there I was just like this is wonderful because we got into a conversation into the word now everybody else was singing songs enjoying it was a beautiful time amen it was good I'm not putting down on no one else but that personal conversation we had in those things of the word was something I took home it had intrinsic value right and there was a couple of those that I'm like I've never saw it that way before so of course I had to tell brother Sergey he couldn't believe that because I had never seen it before nonsense that's right nonsense we're all moving into the revelation of Jesus Christ sister Ruth if you would come amen is it good to be a Christian amen good to have the word good to know that God said whatever your maturity is you're still growing you're still coming closer you're a son or daughter of God this is not an accident this is not a mistake you are my desire amen amen when you look in the word it ought to be a love story it ought to be something that just stirs our hearts a love story that we can pick up the Bible and say Thank You Lord For Loving Me amen you know we're going to be doing a marriage seminar here in a couple weeks or whatever up in Canada and uh I I won't spill titles and whatnot but I'm telling you my brother and sister instead of looking at marriage like it's a struggle we should look at marriage like it's a privilege we have the privilege of serving husband we have a privilege of serving a wife because you see the natural is reflected in the spiritual and if we think that serving God is a duty we think serving God is something that we're forced to do what kind of relationship what kind of relationship my brother and sister it's a privilege we are the most privileged people on the face of the Earth today God loves us says I'm going to put myself even my own spirit in you I'll be with you all the way to the end of this journey now I'm telling you the devil sure likes to tell us we're all alone and we're Lonesome but I tell you every time you turn back to the word The Lonesome Spirit goes away and there's a presence comes let us catch the Revelation that we are in the presence of the Beloved and he claims us don't you love The Song of Solomon I remember I knew a family years ago their kids were like 14 or 15 years old and they're like Mom Dad um they're like don't read about that kids read about it with your spiritual cap on then you'll realize that's a spiritual is reflected in the natural but take it for the spiritual first and you'll realize how much God loves you how he looks at you not in a world carnal sexual pattern that the world likes to turn everything but in this love affair how precious we are to him how beautiful we are to him and how he desires us and Longs for our presence in the meantime the devil is telling you you'll never make it you're not good enough did anywhere in there did it say if you're good enough if we finished our scripture it says because you were boen because you were called because you are my beloved Hallelujah you love the Lord hallelujah I hope that made sense I just hate it when I study so much Brother David and I just think one more scripture one more quote one more comment's going to get the point and then realize that the points already been made but I still have pages of material that I feel compelled to share but God's good amen because we're not preaching to beginners we're not preaching to novices we're preaching to Sons and Daughters of God that know what the word says and the desire amen and I I'm glad it makes preaching easy and when preaching's easy you tend to preach long Amen Hallelujah Lord help us we got a bunch of comments stuff here let's just stand amen uh Brothers I think it's a uh let go and let God have his wonderful way amen hallelujah I hope you can go home today and say it was good to be in the house of the Lord amen let go and let go all have his wonderful way let go and let God have his way oh your Sorrows will vanish your night turn today let go and let God have have his way let's sing it one more time let go and let God have his wonderful way let go and let God have his way oh your Sorrows will vanish your night turn today let go and let God have his way brother Gideon 871 Saints I just wished you would pray for my voice it's since a few weeks ago I just just having these pains that go down from the back of my throat here down into my neck and it's just a devil amen I'll preach till a croak if that's what's necessary now that croak can be whichever way you want to interpret it but you know as long as we're here I made a commitment to the Lord many years I don't want to I don't want to preach just weak I want to preach with strength I want to preach with my heart be able to pour it out so I just ask for your prayers amen that this little Affliction the devil's trying to throw on me we just bind it in the name of Jesus Christ and we'll be able to go amen let's sing
