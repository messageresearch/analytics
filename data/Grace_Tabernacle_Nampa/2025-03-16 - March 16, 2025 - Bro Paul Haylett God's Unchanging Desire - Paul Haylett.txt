sister Wonder uh you know just difficulties of Life employment same things that you face and and they're just kind of going through a test a trial so please remember them amen and uh uh we just uh we thank the Lord for his grace and mercy I want to speak to you uh this morning I thought uh the songs that the Lord laid on brother Alex's heart uh fit in my my esteem very very close to what we're preaching today of God's unchanging desire and uh I'm so glad that he doesn't change you know he he has the same desire to you and I today as he did before the foundation of the world and um it will never become tiresome to him never become burdensome to him never be as we of do as humans forget right we are not forgotten amen amen we are right there in his very presence let's turn in The Book of Mark the 11th chapter verse 22- 26 I sure appreciate your prayers uh I know on Wednesday night as I was ministering I I just U my head felt like it was a basketball and I just struggled to to um kind of be focused and I sure appreciate the prayers we feel much better today uh actually these last few days amen uh Mark 11:22 and Jesus answering saith unto them have faith in God Amen now I I won't take the whole quotation but the prophet of God says you'll only only go as high as your confession amen so what are we confessing today that's right I think we better just stop and say Lord I have faith in you that's my confession I I I trust you I trust your leadership I trust your guidance for verily I say unto you that whosoever shall say unto this mountain be th removed and be cast be thou cast into the sea and shall not doubt in his heart but shall believe that those things which he saith shall come to pass he shall have whatsoever he saith now I don't want to get caught up and keep you standing but I want to really before we get too much further just focus on this right now we're not sitting here what God said he's saying whatsoever you sayith see how God put it back on us we can sit here and say well I I I I I I prayed and uh nothing ever come of it but what was your confession after the prayer what what was you saying after the prayer often times we can put this with with sickness you know uh I prayed that God would heal me or touch my body but this seems to be worse than it was before that's not the confession that we should be having we we need to come to a place where we ask for for loved ones children uh uh parents um spouses we're asking for the Lord to come and do a work back up what we ask have faith in God back it up with words that show we have faith now we're human and I understand there's times that that it's just a human element but my brother and sister the prophet of God so clearly through the message has showed us we're called Beyond this human element amen th this is not supposed to be our control tower no it isn't we can acknowledge that you know you have an ache or a pain and you know you can acknowledge that we're getting older and things are getting more difficult or we we can acknowledge that we're taking tests and studying for things in in high school or well any level of education and it's hard it it it wearies us we you can speak those things but behind all of that you have to have faith in God and ultimately as it is we're talking about schooling talking about tests what's your confession I'm probably going to fail this you probably will yeah the Lord's going to come and meet me there as I take this test and I'm going to pass it you will because you will rise to the level of your confession that's for Natural Things therefore I say unto you what things soever ye desire When you pray believe that you receive them and you shall have them do we believe this word this morning amen and when you stand praying forgive if you have odd against any that your father also which is in heaven May forgive you your trespasses but if you do not forgive neither will your father which is in heaven forgive your trespasses Heavenly Father we just ask you to be with us this morning Lord just open the word Let It Be Alive living in US father and we can stand here with the confidence father that what you have said will come to pass we ask this in the name of Jesus Christ amen you may be seated now I I believe my brother and sister that as we are here this morning that uh just everyone but maybe the littlest of children has some form of a mountain that we're facing in our life and and we Face these mountains sometimes uh uh you know we we can buckle under the pressure of that and you you know it is there that uh uh you know we we each one experience certain stresses in our life and how they affect us because this is the way God made us and and if we uh uh uh hold on to those things you know uh as a song says cast all your cares unto him and you know if we hold on to those pretty soon the burden is so great it it overwhelms us and uh and we come here and it's time my brother and sister we are so many years beyond the prophet being here on the earth something in the 70 year range and and and it really the prophet of God said back then 1965 uh we're just waiting everything's in place we're just waiting for the coming of the Lord and so my brother and sister it's not the politicians and it's not all these things uh the Lord's not going to take a bride in a Rapture until she's completely ready now each one of these equations as you'll look you you'll find you look to what's happening in Israel you look to what's happening in all the other parts of the world uh look at economies and all of these things everything has to be in place uh and I I bring that as example remember when the prophet went to the house to pray for the baby and you know he gets ready he wants to pray for the baby wants to see this baby be healed but yet he realizes God deals with him and the mother-in-law is not there and then and when she shows up he's anxious again but the hat is not in the right place now please take what I'm saying there and realize that whatever is happening in the world uh the bride of Christ we say here and say well the bride must not be ready well my brother and sister there's a lot of ways to look at this maybe the world's not ready Sodom has got to come to its fruition and as wicked as we think the world is maybe sodom's not ready but that doesn't mean that God's not going to Contin continue to perfect the bride don't get the idea that we must not be ready we might have already met the standard in us the bride of Christ that God would require to take us in Rapture my brother and sister but that will not stop God from continuing to perfect this bride amen so while everything is there amen when they go for the oil when they when they go to occupy Jerusalem as it is the Temple Mount being f finished when we see that uh the Catholic Church disrupts uh Israel and the economics uh we see all of these things must come to place when God is here perfecting a bride and so that doesn't give us an excuse to sit down and say well I think I'm ready for the Rapture I say God places that desire in you that you want to be uh closer to him you want to be perfected to a greater so that we don't sit down and stagnate imagine if we we realized this morning that that we had met God's expectation for the Rapture that it would be very hard to maintain uh our our Readiness you might say you know the military that's why they train train train no conflict that they need to go to but to be ready they have to continue to train and God's got you and I here today and he wants us to be ready for the Rapture and he's going to continue to train us and sometimes training is actually as hard as the real Combat and so we look at this and realize today that God is uh uh bringing us to a place that we actually can speak to this mountain amen you know it won't do us any good if if we speak to the mountain but we're not prepared to speak to the mountain so God wants you and I to come to a place of trusting in Him and when we do that we have to recognize what is God's desire for you and I that's why we as belie Bel my brother and sisters should be able to come to a place that in good days bad days whatever the circumstance we would look to it and say you know what this is perfectly in God's plan even when you step a little out of line it's still perfectly in God's plan and so Satan would try to say you're slipping you're falling away you're getting lukewarm but God knows the cycle of humanity this not psychology my brother and sister this is how God Made You you and I and when we get ourselves to the place that we can come and actually have enough trust which can be tied together linked perfectly with faith when we have enough trust to just trust God for everything then we'll realize when a mountain comes in your life now often times you know I know I just speak for myself when I was young I thought they were literally talking about a mountain out here that we needed to move but most of the mountains are right here and right here and there is God coming down telling you when you speak to this mountain it will move see you can't come to Deliverance without the Mountain Moving do you realize each and everyone here today that God has moved a mountain in your life amen but we're waiting for something over here on the backside somewhere some Supernatural event as it is but every time you find Victory in Jesus Jesus Christ a mountain has moved and so I just not to belabor that but remember the prophet shows us very clearly how in the beginning that God cannot be God without worship and God didn't come and just say I'm looking for people just to worship me he actually was searching for Fellowship he wanted a wife he wanted to have someone that he could commune with and and as it is he's there and we know the first Eve fell and we know that Satan has come in this last day and has uh uh very clearly integrated himself into the spiritual world now into the religious world and my brother and sister God's still wanting fellowship and God will have Fellowship because he has created a chosen people now it's not that when I say to chosen people we need to disregard that we're talking about you and you and you and you we need to put it into the concept or or a place that God was looking for a bride and and when it come down before the foundation of the world he didn't say you know I I I'm just going to select anyone I I'm just going to just grab whatever as so to speak the star dust floats through the you know I I'll just grab a little here I'll grab a little there but you see God come down and says you know what I'm going to have a c certain circumstance on the earth in a certain time a certain season and it's going to take a certain personality to be able to express that so I'm going to place a seed into this this individual and that individual is going to come in the right time in the right place in the right circumstance and be the right personality and they're going to be able to come and receive the Holy Ghost receive the word of the hour and be able to fill that place that God said needs to be filled now God has come by the word and has reached out into the world today and I have shared this with the church a lot hope you don't mind one more time at the wide Throne judgment there'll be no excuse no one can appear at the white Throne judgment and God's going to say oh I guess I missed your circumstance so that means in the bride of Christ there's going to be an individual face every single circumstance of life amen and the unbeliever says I couldn't serve a God that could judge like that I couldn't serve a God that was so cruel but you see that's not the way God look looks at it God says I've placed in a bride the very desire for fellowship and she will amen she's not going to be hindered by any kind of form of what we would call sin or disability or whatever circumstance nothing's going to hinder this bride from fellowship amen that means that you are a unique rugged people that are able to stand in the age that we live in and overcome Can someone say I'm an overcomer amen because that's what God has created you to be that is his desire amen he didn't want just a crowds of people to to uh uh stand there and say oh bless God bless God and then leave and go do whatever they want to do he wants a people that want Fellowship he wants a people that want to worship him and he has them that's right amen and so we look at this my brother and sister what is fellowship we've heard brother Brown Put it out two fellows in the same ship let me get a little more intellectual real Fellowship is manifesting the word amen because you can put those two fellows in the ship and if they're not manifesting the word they're just two fellows in a ship amen so it comes down to the point that what God was looking for is a people that coming together with each other and coming together with our Lord Jesus Christ are opening up manifesting fellowshipping around the word bringing the word to pass now you know as well as I do when we sit down and talk about the word of God there is a presence that comes there is an atmosphere that changes when we talk about the word and so as we look at this we'll realize that God wanting Fellowship wasn't just hey how's the weather God wanted a people that come and said you know Lord your word is true you are faithful we just sang the songs that's what I was saying about the song service brother Alex just chose the Lord led him to the right songs and and see we're we're not there just to talk about the weather as it is God's there saying hey how is how is my bride amen and we take a uh uh you know Esther as an example you know she was just like you and I afraid to come before the king I I can't do this morai anointed said this is what you come into the world for a moment such as this it's time for you to stand up because you won't be spared just because you're scared that's right that rhymed didn't it wow see so we come my brother and sister there's got to be someone because the word said that they would be those living Epistles right read of all men I'm claiming that position I don't always do the best job of being a living epistle but I I'm I'm Desiring I I'm pressing into that because that's what the word says I will be and I believe what the word says when it's speaking of me and so as we're there living Epistles and you know these are just basic things Fellowship being a living epistle just basic things of what the Lord's Desiring of usen he comes along he he doesn't put this List of Demands that you know says you know once you give your heart and you get filled with the Holy Ghost you're going to face face face face struggle face trials all all this we as babies wouldn't be able to handle it we would burst under the pressure that's right but as we press along we move farther and we're learning to trust God we're facing things today we could not have faced 12 15 years ago right amen and you say but it seems like it's one great big battle well praise the lord it's one great big battle but we are already declared Victorious amen this is what the word says my brother and sister and I think as we're coming to a time that we need to understand God's desire we need to understand what God's expectation of us and you know the prophet when he was talking about those little hot bed Greenhouse flowers my brother and sister oh you know that's interesting brother Brown said that he was actually preaching a very deep thought to the bride of Christ that God's not looking for little hot house uh you know hot bed flowers he's looking for someone who's rugged who can stand you know uh uh the the the frost can stand freezing temperatures can stand the heat of leoda can stand all the trials that's what God's looking for he uh he hovers the word shows us how he he hovers the Holy Spirit hovers over us my brother and sister but that hovering is God's presence or fellowship with us it is not to keep every little temptation of leoa away from you God wants you to be able to face leod deia I don't always uh do such a good job myself uh I find myself impatient I know that some of you would say Amen this morning and we find ourselves a little little bit uh you know anxious a little bit of this and a little bit of that but what is happening God is changing you he is changing you you're not staying the same otherwise I would tell you if you were the same Hot House flower that you was years ago that you had withered up and blowed Away by now but God has made you into a rugged son or daughter of God because he is moving forward to create by the atmosphere our faith in God our trust in God Amen so we get these mountains in our lives and we declare them impossible but the word shows us that nothing's impossible with God so you can look at your mountain or you can look at God that's right and if you look at I I loved how that was brought out sometime back I think brother Isaac brought that out amen if you put your circumstance right here you cannot see God that's right but if you put God right here you can't see your circumstance so when we get God right in front of us front and center we don't even see our Mountain we will just keep walking and realize we have conquered the mountain that's right now in verse 24 is expressing God's desire therefore I say unto you whatsoever things you desire so God's desire is that ye would desire now we're not talking about carnal things we're not talking about Sin and the lust of the flesh but God is saying my desire is that ye would desire and so I say my brother and sister if we're going to church just to go to church if we're coming to church just because we do recognize that God sent a prophet if you're coming for that reason it won't be sufficient but if you're sitting here this morning because there's a desire in you and you are willing to Express that desire in other words put your feet in action put your hands in action your voice in action put your faith in action then God is looking down saying my desire is expressed amen amen so there it is coming before us and so we look at that and uh you know whatsoever you desire When you pray believe that you receive them and you shall have them does that work yes it does that's kind of a redundant typee question isn't it but only about a tenth of you responded it really should be 100% that's right right we have faith in God Amen you know Victory my brother and sister is many times more like an endurance race than it is you know David cutting the head off of Goliath that's exactly right we're expecting a David and Goliath moment in our lives in leoda and actually the scripture in Revelation tells us he who endures to the end now the word endure is not talking about ease and comfort and flowers and all good things the word endure is to go through hard trial that's right that's rightly right amen exactly right come on we should be able say Lord hard trial that's what it takes amen a mountain if that's what it takes dark valleys if that's what it takes I'm going to endure to the end and as we get that change in our thinking see the problem I hope youall don't get offended this morning but the problem we had we come to the message we realize it's truth it's scriptural we realize it's what God's plan is and we somehow think that coming to the message is our salvation it's actually moving through and becoming the message that's right is our Salvation that's right amen that's right it's not coming to it no it's becoming it that's that's exactly and when we become it my brother and sister then we know we have Victory amen and that's why Satan fights it so much has all kinds of opponents I won't go too far into this but just uh some interaction uh with with some uh uh uh people that were in the message you know years ago walked away two two different events on two different sides of the country in just the last couple weeks of people that were like I know this is the truth I know I need to come back I know I need to live this I know this is correct and in some cases they'd be but there's all this criticism that says this is this and this is this my brother and sister I'll tell you what the Bride of Jesus Christ will climb that mountain and Conquer it she will recognize that she is a daughter of God that she is the Bride of Jesus Christ and it doesn't matter how much Wikipedia it doesn't matter how many critics there are out there she will climb over that mountain and Conquer it because what she is is not defined by Wikipedia no sir amen not defined by the definitions of men who don't even have the Holy Ghost that's it that's right but we listen to them yes sir and we respond oh my I've got a giant question mark now so did Cain Cain had his own Vision version I mean of Wikipedia I'm going to preach it one of these days I just haven't got it fully fleshed out deception hidden in truth yes sir the day we live in my brother and sister they can make truth into deception right absolutely right that's why the word of God is here today and why the prophet of God said go back to the word every single time know the word forward know the word backwards and then pray about it let the Holy Spirit lead you to the correct answer cuz it's not what this man says and it's not what this man says but it's what the Holy Ghost leads to that's right see so as we do this we we see we're moving forward in verse 24 as I said the word is expressing God's desire that whatever you desire now when you are filled with the Holy Ghost can you have any other desire than God's desire if we say we have the Holy Ghost and have a desire different than the holy spirit's leading the word then we don't have the Holy Ghost but there's a lot of religious people stand I I I I can I just looked into a little brief glimpse of a deal I knew it existed and it hasn't changed and you know what um for mere $33,000 God's going to answer your prayers make the checks payable to me you know what sound people do it they believe that's what God's desire is my what limitations can I be just straightforward this morning what limitations have you placed on God that's it I've got a mountain that's it but what limitations have you placed on God concerning your Mountain it's time for us to wipe out all the limitations amen because the word is so straightforward says believe trust and speak too simple we can't do that it's too simple but you see my brother and sister God dwells in simplicity amen you know I I've said that at times here in the church you know brother Brown said in the sermon God in complexity and he may as well have preached it because that's what people turn it into but I toss that out to the Saints there in Sarasota or MAA City there was some of them just most dumbfounded look husbands turning to their wives and they're like and then ding busted but you see the problem is God didn't make it complex we did amen and Satan's right there dig a Little Deeper dig a Little Deeper dig a Little Deeper make it a little more complicated but God in Simplicity said only believe that's right only believe God said it believe it now and speak to your M too simple right so the required action I received a letter from the US government a few days ago and inside that letter it says uh uh there is a required action use those exact words very brief to the point required action here so now in this case I won't go into that but just the the words you know strike you um they expect response and um so here again I'm being redundant but I I feel led to be uh this requires an action you got to have faith that's it you got to believe you got to pray you got to forgive and God says I'll do it but if you don't pray you don't believe you don't forgive I won't even forgive you right boy that's pretty direct my brother and sister that seems to go against John 3:16 but and I don't care John 3:16 does not Trump the rest of the word that's right or man's interpretation of John 3:16 does not Trump the rest of the world now we see God's desire expressed in the word we'll go to First Peter here uh the second chapter and um I'm okay it says here 1 Peter 2:1 wherefore laying aside all malice and all guile and hypocrisies and envies and all evil speakings as newborn babes now I don't want to sound too personal whatever we all understand that we have some babies here in the church I've got grandbabies and I literally don't want to make it sound crass but I'm going to tell you as newborn babes desire the sincere milk yeah I was holding my little grandson the other night for very brief time and he's turned his head and started trying to suck on my collar I'm not the brightest guy around but I'm like I don't think he's wanting Grandpa he's hungry amen can we get that hungry for the word yes sir we should be that hungry for the word that we're going to start searching for the word we're going to start within our limited ability turning here and turning there that we need fed amen right but instead Satan has come in leoa and he's G us a thousand distractions to feed that hunger that should have been focused to our Heavenly Father amen that baby now leave a baby bottle out of the picture that baby's not going to be satisfied with anything but nursing his mother and here we are to come and feed upon the word of God nothing's going to satisfy oh we can fill things in there my brother and sister I've seen a t-shirt recently said uh uh uh chocolate solves everything but I tell you what you won't show up the white Throne judgment with the whole world full of chocolate and it solve that problem amen so chocolate doesn't solve everything desire the sincere milk of the word that you may grow thereby amen I kind of wonder sometimes pardon me for being so straightforward but I kind of wonder if we're growing at the rate that God wants us to grow amen we're we're we're we're eating we're not completely malnutritioned but I wonder if we're where we should be that's it if so be tasted that the Lord is gracious to whom coming as unto a living Stone disallowed indeed of men but chosen of God and precious ye also he's talking to you also as Lively stones are built up a spiritual house a holy priesthood to offer up spiritual sacrifices acceptable to God by Jesus Christ amen see nothing else my brother and sister except what being offered is acceptable you can offer all you want if it's not acceptable you're not being built up amen I don't mean to sound harsh it's not in my heart but I think we got to break the hold of leoda yes sir we've got way too many things that we're accepting as the substitute that's exactly right amen right that's that's EXA I'll let you pray through and decide in your life I won't walk around and say I think you got this I think you got that it's not my job my job as I read in the scripture this morning is to stir up your pure mind now you want to know what God's desire to you was he didn't say you're filthy you're corrupted you're evil he said you're pure mind amen that's how God's looking is your pure mind and you should look at yourself in that same fashion amen amen so you know we're here in the house of God this morning to express this scripture we're here to put into action the message sent To Us by God that's right and and it's not to debate my brother and sister now I believe I believe in correct Doctrine I don't believe we just kind of just fumble our way through Doctrine and say well God will correct it God has corrected it it's here the correct Doctrine is been presented it's alive it's well but my brother and sister we need to come to the place that we actually can put this message into action amen that's it that's the I think the bigger problem we we are preaching on deep deep things that that people uh uh they grasp that and I I would make a kind of an assumption cuz I don't want to make a a declaration but um the deeper things that are preached I would dare to say that most Believers in the end of the day will never use it you're not going to be in the workplace and some Temptation struggle there and you're going to start quoting the seals and that's going to take your Temptation away your struggle might disagree with me and that's fine we've placed so much emphasis on on all of these things right here and there's nothing to back it up what do you mean brother Paul I meant just what I said we can quote it we can explain it where's the action yeah that's right where's the word that backs it up I'll give you a little brief Glimpse here's ago Jerry and I kids were little we were in financial financial trouble and um I knew that I knew that I had to do something different and I went and got a job working in a wood molding plant for the winter and I I went in there as just a temp the only job lower than what I had was pushing a broom and I would have been happy to push the broom because the guy leaned on it most of the time they didn't do anything about it would have been such an easy job instead as molding would come out of a a molding machine and it come out and it was cut into links and and um I had the really hard job of standing in the same exact spot for 8 hours a day grabbing the molding and putting it on a cart this what I did all day long and you'd think wow you got it made easy job until some little I'll be polite some little girl was assigned to work at that station with me an easy job turned into a hard job because by the second day she's like would you like to get a drink after work if you don't go to bars you could come to my house I'm married that doesn't matter to me I really don't want to work with you tough luck I'm here and I want to be your friend I'll tell you what you do you go lean on something over there I'll do the work just stay out of my way I tell sister Jerry my goodness what have I got myself into I need the money I go back to work finally the little girl gets the message oh she was very pretty but I'm sorry this is kind of blunt language um that is Satan zeden that's right finally one day second third day in first thing in the morning I need to use the restroom fine with me five six hours later superintendent Foreman whatever you call him comes around and goes where's your helper I say she's using the restroom I didn't say it was five or six hours ago cuz she can go hang out in the restroom if she wants I don't need her I don't want her around but you see my point being is you go try to get an honest job and Satan's already got a minion waiting for you MH yeah it happens in grocery stores it happens in whever place that you want to describe Satan's already got a minion amen waiting for you I'll tell you one last thing and concerning that little story I was working on a different machine one day and and the man says hey um what do you think of our our our our foreman our our crew leader what do you think of her and I I don't know she seems like a nice lady man she is so weird she is just over the toop weird you need to stay away from her and I was like what what's weird about her and he goes uh I I I just uh she just too weird she just over the top so I went into lunch that day they had a weird thing there where you you took two breaks you didn't really have lunch and I went into the morning break and I sat down at a table I prayed over my food started eating and this weird boss comes in and sits down pretty close to me opens up her lunchbox pulls out a Bible lays it down and starts reading her Bible and I was like there it is it is she's weird you see to Leo deia that's weird that's right but to us I just turned and I said it's probably a redundant question but are you a Christian and she says thank the Lord he saved me and uh then after that every break time she was my boss every break time we sat pretty much the same spot talked about scripture come Friday I turned in my hours that they have to sign them off to to the deal there and the man's like looking forward to it Paul I'm put in already for you to become a full-time employee and that gets you like a $4 an hour raise and I said don't bother I quit because you see I realized whatever that had in that building one Christian and 300 employees yeah and I hope you follow me it wouldn't be real correct for me to Chum up even if she was a Christian I'm like out of here you know my brother and sister the moment that God calls you to be a witness the moment that God says you know what I want you to stay with my desire sorry to be a little crasp not the desire of the world not desire for those people not desire for their life desire for him he is is our husband Lord help us to be faithful and keep that in mind now look so we got to put this message in action and and you know the thing is is the too many people have come and and they believe they're following the right thing but you see they never made The Message personal and when they come into a time and a place that they come into hard struggles they come into this time and the message is not personal my brother and sister now I I just I won't say who but just listening to a brother I respect he's actually passed away now but uh you know listening to him preach and he put it he because says you know people don't even really understand what the relationship he's meaning about the message what the relationship is because they're paralleled to the world and the world is just all giddy about oh we're standing here today you know and oh I'm getting married and this is so lovely I'm so in love and in less than three years they hate each other and standing there screaming at one another and how much they hate and never no my brother and sister this is the thing when you have a personal relationship you can never fall out of love in a personal relationship it's not what God can do for you and I it's not how beautiful the message is it is when you come down and realize the part of me that was missing is right here this is who I am I can know no more leave it than I can leave myself and when it comes to that position we can stand on that and and we we come to this place that we accept it on a personal basis and then we start to realize at that point we're now experiencing God's desire amen as long as it's a religious following that's not God's desire but it's when it becomes a personal basis that we realize I cannot live with without this amen I tell you we can quit I I I I mean I don't want to Spook anybody but I've quit the message so many times well not the message really being a preacher I've quit so many times and and I'm just done I'm not doing this no more and then a thought will come and I have to rush in the house or in the office and write it down you see Satan anoints that to cause it to move from a personal to an impersonal relationship in other words facts Malachi 4:5 Revelations 10 all of these things Point yes we acknowledge that is it personal are you experiencing God's desire you guys are all kind of quiet today and it must be acted on on a personal basis that's right amen I'm not throwing sister Jerry under the bus it just looks like a bus you know the other day she just made a comment that just threw me for a loop and I thought how can she say that I stopped and thought about it and I said what am I going to do so I went and hugged her end of end of conversation yep end of conflict y I thought about it literally it might even have been my own voice I heard I don't know I can either turn this into something or I can turn this into something amen and when we come to this place my brother and sister Hard Times Hard trials struggles we think God should have made it smooth before us we got a choice amen Let It Be impersonal or make it personal and personal is not insults anger throwing things personal is when you say I realize I love them more amen than anything else amen we have a personal relationship with Jesus Christ you can't be driven away from the word that's actually God's desire you are not a Hot House Christian you are Sons and Daughters of God of the Lord most high he made you rugged amen we look back through it I I can't think of quite the words of that song uh uh something on the order of uh a never promised or whatever that is you know that it'd be easy it'd be cold you'll be hot you'll be all those things if you remember what that song is I can't quite grasp the words of it but you know I'm going to say right now just for the sake of time it's time to get over your flawed human thinking amen it's time to not let our flawed thinking direct our spiritual directions that's right it's time for us to put our flawed thinking to the side and say I'm just going to blindly follow the word and people say I'll blindly follow nothing then you would not have been a disciple that's right come on any disciples here this morning amen we have to blindly follow God cuz you can't explain the cosmos you can't do it there's always a question out there why don't we embrace the Lord's desire for us now I've got to hurry along otherwise today's going to be really long if God be with us then where is all the Miracles and that sermon right there my brother and sister I've heard it more than once used as why people quit the message where is all the Miracles we're not seeing what was promised well it's interesting they're not really quitting the message they're actually quitting serving God because the message is God that's right and they're expecting miracles to be like this and when they're not like that then they're saying there's nothing happening but I'll tell you my brother and sister I've seen I I give you just a brief story if you don't mind amen h h a young man his family moved to a church and he stayed where they lived and um he was there and he met a girl at the gym now I I struggle myself with with you know message uh uh men women uh hanging out in fitness centers I honestly do I mean they have hardly a dress code there and you go in there you can say well I I'll look at the floor well you can't hardly do nothing in a place like that looking at the floor and but you know we'll look at this and and and we'll wonder what God's doing sometimes and this young man's uh meets a girl at the fitness center and they are attracted to each other and and uh even uh as the parents are back and forth moving he introduces this girl to his parents and his parents immediately go into nervous mode and um they're they're just struggling what is our son done this is a wonderful girl she's nice she's polite in a world we live in reasonbly uh modest but I tell you what happens God knows what he's doing and and he finally decides he's going to move uh to the church his parents moved to and this young lady comes to visit and she's sitting in a service and she's sitting there in a service and something took place something that you and I could not say uh uh uh you know it will or it won't you just you just don't know and at the end of this service she goes up front the minister comes down Pastor comes down and she says I believe everything you said today I want to be baptized right now right there she gave her heart to the Lord could you see that coming but we probably will doubt her experience because it just happened too simple when God does a work God does a work and the desire that was in her didn't come in that service it was there before the foundation of the world that was God's desire and how he fulfilled it well would make I think even a pastor nervous let me just put it on notice if you're going to go to fitness center workout co-ed thing please don't tell me about it that's right okay God be with us then where's all the Miracles if that isn't the picture of the church today just as soon as it gets out of one twist and right into another when it goes uh but time had come for action and that's the same now the time has come for Action the time had come when playing church had come to a halt with God there's no more playing Church H can can we hold on to that grasp that we're no more playing Church it's time come for Action amen there's no more playing church we must get down to business and I trust that the same God will place this upon the heart of the people tonight that it's time for a halt of playing Church playing religious playing righteous and now it's time for action and I was speaking this morning upon the subject of what the new birth was and how we come to it and surely that still sinks into your heart now the time has come to act upon what you know to be the truth you cannot act with faith until first you know what you're doing oh isn't that the truth this is my brother and sisters sorry to be blunt this is not good enough to say God sent a prophet you need to know what you're here for you need to know what God called you to do it's not just an acknowledgement but you need to know you got to first know what you're doing before you can have faith to do it some said to me uh said someone said to me once a noted doctor was talking about a miracle that happened among a sick person and he said preacher don't you believe if you told them people to go out and touch a tree or a pro the same thing would take place and I said no sir I said because you cannot have faith in touching a tree or a post faith is not that loose amen it's got to be based upon some noted fact you got to know something about what you're having faith in before you can have faith in it so we first must know how and what and what God's desire is amen not quoting scripture not quot and quotes that's right you must know yourself what God's plan is and how to approach God by that plan and then we can talk up boldly walk up boldly to the throne of grace and plead what the plan is promised us my brother and sister I tell you when Caleb's daughter when she come that day and ask her dad for the upper and lower pasture and the water of the upper and lower you know where her example line right there in her own father she got to watch him come one day and say where is my Mountain Caleb come and he was anointed of God and I want you to just catch this today my brother and sister here's a daughter no doubt special to Caleb but she's sitting here as it were looking up at her father and seeing her father come boldly I want to use this as a tip boldly to the throne and saying where is my Mountain where is my promised land and she something registered down in her heart and she got old enough she got married and she's there and she says I have a promise go my father are you with me has given me a promise and I have an example before me and I'm going to hold to the example because I saw God honor the example when my natural father went and claimed what was rightfully his I saw the example and it registered in my heart and now I'm a married woman and I have a promise and I'm coming now but this promise is no good without the water of the washing of the water of the word the Holy Ghost that's right and she come boldly to claim what was hers that's right amen not sitting back saying if God wants to give it to me but boldly asking amen why take this in a spiritual context she knew her father's desire it was her father's desire to give it to her more than she she even wanted it herself amen oh boy Lord help us that's right yeah first we must know that's it and what God's desire right is I'll just be blunt is it okay I'm a few days older speaking of getting older we had some of our young people had birth happy birthday just imagine what that's going to feel like for the Lord terries 40 more years yeah you see you look at this and when we realize that something has to happen Saints forgive me I hope I don't sound harsh or anything we've set on the Pew quoting the quotes long enough amen it's it's time for us to start expressing God's desire right that's right it's time for us to start saying you know what if I'm a living epistle it's time for me to be a living epistle that's right amen if I am the word made flesh amen it's time for this flesh to start walking that's right amen that's right Hallelujah we can sit around and talk about it for a long time that's right but it's time for us to actually manifest it now in perfect strength by perfect weakness I'm going to be a a few minutes over so I hope yall are good we'll Rush right through this when we are insufficient ourselves that's it then we are subjects to yield to God's spirit that's exactly right as long as we think that we can do it then we can't do it but when we get to the place we know we can't do it then we yield oursel to God and he does it so then if it's trying to do it we'll fail but if we'll just yield oursel to God then God can't fail uh there's only one thing that God cannot do and that's fail he can do anything else but fail he cannot fail I think the prophet wanted to drive that home so as long as we're trying in ourselves and depending on our own abilities and so forth we'll do nothing but when we get to a place where we know we're nothing then God can use us amen the important thing one of the important things that we must Master am now remember this and especially you young preachers sir lay members alike there's one thing that we've got to master if we expect to fulfill God's desire in our life I think every one of us here this morning wants to fulfill God's desire in our life that is we have to master the thought of human ability that's it well praise God I've got a certain mountain in my life I'm going to remove that mountain I'm going to speak and the Mountain's going to go if God doesn't anoint your voice that's it the word from your mouth that Mountain's going nowhere that's exactly and people get discouraged because I've rebuked this I have done this I've experienced in my own life I've experienced I I I think I'm almost qualified to talk about it you know it comes to the point that we think we're going to get this out of here oh I I got faith enough to kick this thing out of my life and then it just remains and then we get discouraged and then it comes back and boomerangs on us and and then you look at this and you realize you know what I I was doing this I was thinking that I had enough to to do this but what God's wanting us to do is say Lord I believe this word and you said that if I would believe and I would confess and I would act upon this that the mountain would move now Lord I'm standing here believing this and maybe on the back side of that mountain one little Pebble started rolling down the mountain exactly right but in a month I guess the Lord didn't hear my prayer knowing a month it'd be the time to say Lord I believe it now more than ever that's right I believe Lord this is your word Amen brother Brown preached it in time tested Memorials of God God doesn't throw up a memorial my brother and sister with a 24-hour expiration date on it they'll Ser but as long as you're trying in ourselves dependent on our own ability so forth well we'll do nothing but when you get to a place where we know we're nothing then God can use us the important thing is one of the important things that we must Master now remember this I'm reading this again just bear with me now remember this and especially you young preachers and lay members there's one thing we've got to master if we expect to fulfill God's desire in our life that is we've got to master the thought of human ability you ever get to the spot where we think we can do it with our own intelligence our own abilities we've got to master that in such a way that we can get rid of the thing and lay it aside so that God can use us that's right am make a complete surrender we cannot use one ability youve got to make a complete surrender and come to God you've got to surrender to him both soul body Spirit everything that you are has to be surrendered to God in order that he can work his will in you and in me amen what do we looking we're looking through the prophet's words God's desire to you and I I want want you to just up and surrender everythingall give it all up oh that doesn't mean you see my brother and sister the the issue the Rich Young Ruler now maybe I'm pushing boundaries in the scripture but the Rich Young Ruler the reason he could not say yes to Jesus was as he looked out and all he had amassed by his ability that's it right now this is theorem okay this is Paul's opinion there was a man who knew how to make money knew how to Rally people around make it happen if he just said Lord I give it all to you I give up do you realize that the Lord would have used him the orphans on the corner those that were sick would have had a hospital there would have been a food bank God would have used him in a fashion like that I'm not saying exactly how it would be but that was the ability God gave him y but he was looking I did this I did this I did that and he goes further down in scriptures and says I've got so much wealth I better tear down my Barns and he thought that he was preparing himself for another season of prosperity but he come into a season that God said time for you to go home uhhuh right that's it I don't want to get sidetracked spiritual growth my brother and sister comes true spiritual growth comes when we yield to the Lord's desire for our life that's right rust is intellectual y emotional Etc amen but truth spiritual growth amen is when we lay ourself on the Altar and say Lord that's it that's right here I am that's exactly right use me amen amen I'm dying amen that's right I want to die today it right there amen amen amen second Peter 13 and 4 according as his divine power hath given unto us all things that pertain unto life and godliness through the knowledge of him that hath called us to glory and virtue whereby are given unto us exceeding great and precious promises that by these you might be partakers of a divine nature having escaped the corruption that is in the world through lust look it our Lord's desire to you and I amen we're walking in that desire today I believe amen we walk in the word we're seeing that desire expressed in us and I I want to put it to to you this way as I close sister via would you come musicians I want to put it to you this way we don't even understand God's plan for our life that's right that's right we don't even understand it we'll try to explain it we'll try to tell everyone what it is we don't understand it let go that's it and let God that's it have his way that is right ex the perfect plan of God is yours amen if you will allow him to reveal it in you that is the key right it's not what we say it is it's what he says it is amen amen his divine power has been given to us amen unto a life and godliness my brother and sister this world's not your home sir it's time for us to just let go and let God Express his desire in us what He longs to do amen one more quote thank you unwelcomed Christ Jesus said your children of the light walk in the light and you won't walk in darkness he that walks in darkness doesn't know where he's going he can't see where he's going but a man that's walking in light knows where he's going you might have a lot of stumbles but we're Homeward Bound that's one thing sure you know where you're going because you're walking in the light amen amen amen praise the Lord I hope this made sense today you know Saints we look at this and realize God's desire to us I know the thoughts I have toward you such an expression can we really trust God yes sir can yes you know the prophet made a [Music] statement it's going to take desperation yes he did to drive us into the Rapture amen right now I want to ask you is our interpretation of that quote what the prophet meant or what God meant see we don't know that's right internal drive us to desperation external drive us to desperation I think it will be both I think some God will have to use circumstance out here that's exactly some in their soul are going to say Lord I've got to be ready that's right I'm going to be ready I want to be ready Lord and they will then be expressing God's perfect desire God did not want I this is just as Paul's opinion God didn't want to have to use us a Dark Age type example to get us into desperation he wanted his word right to come come and bring us to desperation but if we're too stubborn too distracted too something or other then the Lord will use whatever it is cu you see this was a theoretical question that come out after the Dark Ages were those people that were eaten by the Lions burnt by the Flames thrown from The Cliffs fed to the wild dogs and Hogs were they really God's chosen leave it to a theologian to come up with a question like that after all we believe God and that didn't happen to us we're not in that age that's anybody have mind battle this last week yes sir maybe you're not saved cuz you had a mind battle amen or maybe it's closer to proof that you are because Satan's attacking you but I say that that sounds awkward but forget all of that mind battle no mind battle forget all of that let's dig in and find God's desire for our life the Troubles of this life are not going to stop a bride from a Rapture she's going to make a Rapture don't get distracted with the God loves me you know this the average average denominational Christian she's got this giant flower here God loves me God doesn't God loves me God doesn't God loves me God no he said he loves you amen that's all it takes amen amen I I'm preaching the castoff not notes Here I need to stop amen 365 brother Isaac Hallelujah let's just stand and Worship the Lord for just a minute or two [Music] amen
