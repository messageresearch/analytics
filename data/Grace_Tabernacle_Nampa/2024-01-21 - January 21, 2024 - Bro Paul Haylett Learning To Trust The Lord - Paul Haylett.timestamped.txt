[50:56] very short so you don't have to stand
[50:58] but we just had a a wonderful time
[51:02] uh you know uh there's a lot could be
[51:06] said but I'll just say that um God was
[51:09] really
[51:10] gracious uh our brother
[51:12] David uh invited us to be a part of
[51:15] Newport Camp our convention actually I
[51:18] guess is what it would be and you know I
[51:21] got to meet a lot of brothers that I
[51:23] never knew before and um we got to see
[51:27] the power of the Gospel change lives so
[51:30] many
[51:31] testimonies uh the testimonies go into
[51:34] the dozens upon dozens of of positive
[51:38] report coming back of things that have
[51:41] changed and I I interacted and got to
[51:44] speak to many of these young people and
[51:46] to hear uh their testimonies and it it
[51:49] is lifechanging even for us amen we
[51:53] stand there and preach the gospel but
[51:55] we're still human and sometimes we just
[51:58] need encouragement our own selves and
[52:00] God come and we got to see that was not
[52:02] without opposition amen Satan was there
[52:07] amen broke my heart but there were young
[52:09] people that sat during the service and
[52:11] looked at their phones and laughed
[52:13] sharing a joke or something with each
[52:15] other but my brother and sister I don't
[52:18] want to be rude but the word of God is
[52:21] to the believer amen amen if people
[52:24] don't want to believe
[52:26] I'm not talking about going through the
[52:27] struggle of life don't misunderstand me
[52:29] I'm not talking about fighting a battle
[52:31] and sometimes feeling like you've been
[52:33] overrun by the enemy but I'm talking
[52:35] about just a a cold Spirit an
[52:37] indifferent spirit and I prayed for
[52:40] young people and I was blunt uh maybe
[52:42] not the normal Paul that you might know
[52:44] but I was incredibly blunt with some of
[52:46] these young people uh of don't let this
[52:48] Indi Spirit keep you from being blessed
[52:51] and saw some respond and some didn't but
[52:54] it doesn't matter matter we were there
[52:55] doing what God wanted us to do and I
[52:58] believe that it was a powerful work I
[53:00] never knew brother Andrew Spencer before
[53:02] but uh got to have a lot of time to
[53:06] interact to talk on the things of God
[53:08] talk on natural things and um I just
[53:11] bring uh a a uh thank you from Brother
[53:14] Andrew I text him very early this

[53:48] young man I I can't even put to words uh

[53:55] was as though uh I say this kind of
[53:58] humorous you know married people can
[54:01] answer or finish each other's questions
[54:03] and I found with brother Matt that uh uh
[54:07] I was just like yep and he's going to
[54:10] say and then he would come along and say

[55:23] I saved it for last greetings from our
[55:26] brother David and sister St iers uh
[55:29] Brother David is the pastor of the
[55:31] church there in Nazareth Belgium um oh I
[55:36] forgot I was going to write the title

[55:39] Church basically shorten it up in
[55:42] English uh the Bride of Jesus Christ
[55:45] assembly amen and uh just a lovely group
[55:48] of people um and um uh Brother David
[55:53] sister EST send their greetings and um
[55:56] they're doing an incredible work uh
[55:59] they're a church not much different in
[56:01] size maybe a little bit bigger than us
[56:04] but very much a spearhead of uh many
[56:07] things there in that area and uh a a
[56:10] great example amen that it doesn't take
[56:14] a large Church to do a great work amen
[56:18] and I tell you Saints I I would like us
[56:20] to catch that kind of vision amen that
[56:23] it doesn't take a huge church and it
[56:24] doesn't take uh uh what we always put as
[56:27] oh if we this and if we that but just to
[56:31] yield to the will of God let God do the
[56:34] work amen it's a an amazing thing so I
[56:39] bring greetings from Brother David and
[56:41] the church to you amen let's turn our
[56:45] Bibles I want to speak to you this
[56:46] morning on this title challenged but not
[56:50] defeated learning to trust the Lord uh I
[56:54] spoke spoke a little bit bit of this uh
[56:57] there last Sunday in Belgium uh but I
[57:01] just felt it on my heart to to come back
[57:04] and you know I kind of put it out to
[57:06] Sister Jerry I said do you think it
[57:07] would be strange for me to preach the
[57:09] same sermon and uh just as a wife she's
[57:13] just like you won't preach it the same
[57:15] anyway so just go go ahead and so here
[57:19] we go amen sister Leah sister Gabriella
[57:23] are going to say you know I think I've
[57:25] heard this before but it won't be so by
[57:28] God's grace amen we turn to the Book of
[57:31] James first chapter verses 2-8 and
[57:35] you're very familiar with these
[57:36] scripture and by the way I don't know if
[57:38] I said it I am so happy to be home amen
[57:43] God bless you
[57:44] Mel my lovely niece I love her so much
[57:48] Michael amen so surprised see Michael
[57:51] there coming seemingly out of the veil
[57:54] just walked right
[57:55] and that's just awesome
[57:58] Amen the scripture very familiar for us
[58:01] my brother and sister and until you
[58:04] catch by Revelation what God is really
[58:07] saying to you this scripture will always
[58:10] seem to be difficult but when you catch
[58:13] by Revelation what God is really saying
[58:15] what he's doing you will read this
[58:17] scripture and you will say praise the
[58:20] Lord amen hallelujah glory to God Amen
[58:24] because I will be tested and I will be
[58:29] challenged but I will not be
[58:33] defeated amen there's the whole thing
[58:35] it's not whether you face the battle my
[58:37] brother and sister and it's not matter
[58:39] whether you come unscathed from the
[58:41] battle it's knowing that you cannot be
[58:44] defeated is what makes the difference in
[58:47] our lives amen my brethren count it all
[58:50] joy when you fall into diverse
[58:52] Temptations knowing this that the trying
[58:56] of your faith Amen Let me back up a
[58:58] little bit having the revelation of
[59:02] this that the trying of your faith
[59:04] worketh patience but let patience have
[59:07] her perfect work that you may be perfect
[59:10] and entire which is complete wanting
[59:13] nothing but if any of you lack wisdom
[59:16] let him ask of God that he giveth to all
[59:18] men liberally and up Brath not and it
[59:21] shall be given him but let him ask in
[59:24] Faith nothing wavering for he that
[59:26] wavereth is like a wave of the sea
[59:28] driven with the wind and tossed for let
[59:32] not that man think that he shall receive
[59:34] anything of the Lord a double-minded man
[59:37] is unstable in his spiritual
[59:43] life in all things that's right amen if
[59:46] you find yourself being tossed and
[59:48] driven just stop go back through this
[59:52] scripture and let this scripture come
[59:54] alive
[59:55] cuz when it comes alive the devil can't
[59:59] blast you hard enough to shake you now
[1:00:02] when I say shake you my brother and
[1:00:04] sister that won't mean this old flesh
[1:00:06] amen one of these days we're going to
[1:00:08] catch the Revelation this old flesh is
[1:00:10] not our friend we're going to catch a
[1:00:12] revelation this old flesh should not be
[1:00:14] our control tower amen but the old flesh
[1:00:17] has got a voice and that voice doesn't
[1:00:20] belong to God amen amen it belongs to
[1:00:22] the flesh amen and we know
[1:00:25] what that anointing is amen amen
[1:00:27] Heavenly Father we ask you come Lord as
[1:00:30] we would just come give us Lord the
[1:00:32] courage to speak boldly today let it
[1:00:35] speak concisely today father let it make
[1:00:38] a difference Lord we don't want this
[1:00:40] just to be a tradition we come and stood
[1:00:42] and spoke to the people and the people
[1:00:45] responded and we go home with nothing
[1:00:47] changed but let today be a day father
[1:00:50] that we could lift a hand lift a heart
[1:00:52] and say Lord change me change my heart
[1:00:55] oh Lord father change me into your image
[1:00:59] Lord bring me to a place that I can walk
[1:01:01] with the confidence that I know Lord you
[1:01:04] intend for me to walk in Lord we ask you
[1:01:07] for your blessing today ask for your
[1:01:08] anointing in the name of Jesus Christ
[1:01:11] amen you may be
[1:01:13] seated I guess I might as well just get
[1:01:16] this out in the open so that you'll all
[1:01:18] know that that in just roughly two weeks
[1:01:21] we will be going for the first time in
[1:01:24] years to
[1:01:25] Chile and um just asking that the Lord
[1:01:29] would just give us something that it not
[1:01:31] just be a visit uh to say hi to old
[1:01:35] friends but if God would be so gracious
[1:01:39] that it would be a time of the opening
[1:01:41] of the word a time that the Holy Spirit
[1:01:44] would use us to uh maybe touch a new
[1:01:48] generation of young people I I look at
[1:01:50] the pictures and uh Communications that
[1:01:53] are shared and um you know that uh I'm
[1:01:57] just going to speak boldly I don't want
[1:01:58] to sound conceited but those that we
[1:02:01] were instrumental and then coming to the
[1:02:03] Lord and being baptized and lives being
[1:02:06] changed amen and now we see them they
[1:02:09] have families they've got little
[1:02:10] children and they're they're solid
[1:02:12] they're moving forward some are
[1:02:14] ministers now some are deacons in the
[1:02:16] church some are Street evangelists uh
[1:02:19] going out with a courage bold to stand
[1:02:21] in the Public Square and preach to the
[1:02:23] people but there's a new generation that
[1:02:25] has risen up and God wants to touch that
[1:02:28] generation just as much as he touched
[1:02:30] the previous generations and I believe
[1:02:33] that God is doing that now I believe
[1:02:35] that the same holy ghost that stood on
[1:02:36] the platform with the prophet and spoke
[1:02:39] and discerned the hearts of the people
[1:02:41] is sitting right here this morning in
[1:02:43] our midst to deal with you and I and to
[1:02:46] deal with our young people amen and it's
[1:02:49] time for us just to have a courage bold
[1:02:51] amen the timid that's good is a natural
[1:02:54] nature my nothing wrong with a natural
[1:02:57] timid nature but my brother and sister
[1:02:59] as Sons and Daughters of God it's a time
[1:03:01] that we're called to be bold not a time
[1:03:04] to sit back and say I hope but it's a
[1:03:06] time to say the word says amen amen and
[1:03:09] when we enter into the word says it's no
[1:03:11] longer our natural nature that is
[1:03:14] controlling us but it is the word of God
[1:03:17] itself amen now as we look at this today
[1:03:20] I want to just uh preach to you amen as
[1:03:22] I I said this title challenged but not
[1:03:26] defeated and uh you know uh it is what
[1:03:30] God is working in our life my brother
[1:03:32] and sister is not just for us to come to
[1:03:34] the house of God and stand boldly and
[1:03:36] say praise God Amen and sing the songs
[1:03:39] but it is for us to be in our time alone
[1:03:42] in the time of great travail as it would
[1:03:44] be to be on our own ship on the sea of
[1:03:48] life and a storm coming and shaking our
[1:03:51] little ship Amen to be able to stand in
[1:03:53] those times and be able to say my God is
[1:03:56] in control Amen to have faith in him and
[1:04:00] you know we're living in a world that
[1:04:02] the average Christian is looking for
[1:04:05] what God can do for them I I like to go
[1:04:08] maybe I'm a little counterculture
[1:04:09] forgive me if that would be offensive in
[1:04:11] any way but I like to go and see exactly
[1:04:14] you know the prophet of God said that H
[1:04:17] in these latter times we would see them
[1:04:19] coming for the oil and I like to just
[1:04:22] kind of go and take a glimpse into
[1:04:24] what's happening in their world to see
[1:04:26] what they're doing and and you're seeing
[1:04:28] a stirring you're seeing as it is in
[1:04:31] that context a Revival taking place
[1:04:33] because the people are realizing you see
[1:04:35] it over and over and over again if you
[1:04:37] know where to look people are saying
[1:04:39] there's got to be more now these are not
[1:04:41] people that are looking for just some
[1:04:43] Supernatural event to go woo over but
[1:04:47] they're they're actually hungry for more
[1:04:49] but when they come face to face with the
[1:04:52] more is what we'll show where that
[1:04:55] desire is or the limits of that desire
[1:04:58] and so it's there that it's wonderful to
[1:05:00] go to meet people Amen to meet people
[1:05:03] that have been witnessed to Once on the
[1:05:06] street and something in them said I I I
[1:05:08] need to go and not even getting enough
[1:05:11] information to know where a church is at
[1:05:13] and to start just praying you know where
[1:05:15] where is this that man I talked to on
[1:05:17] the street where is he who is he where's
[1:05:21] his church at and then to be somewhere
[1:05:23] and standing somewhere and just feel
[1:05:26] compelled to speak and say you know I
[1:05:28] met these people the other day they
[1:05:30] described themselves as Holiness and and
[1:05:32] you know they spoke these words that
[1:05:34] were special to me and and I don't know
[1:05:36] where they at do you know anyone like
[1:05:38] that and they're like their next
[1:05:40] door and for God to lead them right
[1:05:43] there my brother and sister we serve a
[1:05:45] supernatural God don't don't put limits
[1:05:47] on him amen don't put a boundary on him
[1:05:49] don't you know we we might put a chain
[1:05:51] on our dog to keep him from wandering
[1:05:53] but listen not put a chain on God let
[1:05:56] God move where God wants to move let God
[1:05:58] move with the authority that is the word
[1:06:00] in our hour amen we don't have a watered
[1:06:03] down wishy-washy message we have a
[1:06:05] message that came from the Throne of God
[1:06:08] and it came to you and I let's take a
[1:06:10] halz of that amen and as we look in the
[1:06:14] world today we're seeing that the
[1:06:17] Prosperity Gospel is starting to crack
[1:06:19] the faade of the Prosperity Gospel is
[1:06:21] starting to break because even people
[1:06:23] that were were totally committed to that
[1:06:25] are realizing that there's something
[1:06:27] Hollow there something that's not being
[1:06:29] produced and they have money God's bless
[1:06:32] them they have nice houses beautiful
[1:06:33] cars they have all of this but they're
[1:06:35] still empty on the inside and there's no
[1:06:38] reason for you and I to be here today
[1:06:40] and be empty on the inside there's no
[1:06:43] reason for us to be sitting here
[1:06:45] wondering what is it and who am I and
[1:06:48] where am I going and what is going on
[1:06:50] because God's brought a certain word in
[1:06:52] this hour but if we're not careful well
[1:06:54] my brother and sister the attributes and
[1:06:56] actions of others will cause us to pull
[1:06:58] back from the promise of God that's
[1:07:00] promised to you amen maybe it's not
[1:07:02] promised to someone else but it's
[1:07:04] promised to you and let's claim that
[1:07:06] promise amen that it's there that it's
[1:07:08] our word and you know this idea that
[1:07:11] came many years ago that Prosperity was
[1:07:14] a sign of God's blessing was there in
[1:07:17] sense you can say yes God blesses us but
[1:07:20] when we take that as an absolute it's
[1:07:22] contrary to the word of God the real
[1:07:24] blessing in this hour my brother and
[1:07:26] sister is when the Holy Ghost will lead
[1:07:28] you and guide you deeper and deeper and
[1:07:31] deeper and deeper and deeper into the
[1:07:34] truth there's a sign that God is present
[1:07:36] with us and the Holy Spirit is moving in
[1:07:38] our midst it's not for us to live
[1:07:40] shallow lives it's not for us to have
[1:07:42] shallow Revelation I'm not talking about
[1:07:45] you have to go into deep Mysteries to to
[1:07:47] find or be in the presence of God but
[1:07:50] it's not for us to live shallow lives
[1:07:53] it's for us to live lives or we have an
[1:07:55] absolute that Jesus Christ is Lord and
[1:07:58] Savior that Jesus Christ is our provider
[1:08:01] he is our Castle you might say our Tower
[1:08:04] of strength he is everything the word of
[1:08:07] God said he is to us and when we can
[1:08:09] come and hold unwavering to that we
[1:08:11] stand this test of time amen you know
[1:08:15] we're looking I almost feel sorry now
[1:08:17] don't misunderstand me I'm not speaking
[1:08:19] condescending but I feel sorry for
[1:08:21] people here in denomination my brother
[1:08:23] and sister
[1:08:24] because you see they don't have a real
[1:08:26] Revelation and they're still facing the
[1:08:29] Same Spirit of leoa that you
[1:08:32] face now imagine you're out here in Leo
[1:08:35] deil with an absolute uncertainty
[1:08:37] there's nothing Rock Solid in your life
[1:08:40] and you're uncertain about politics I've
[1:08:43] talked to people that were afraid you
[1:08:45] know this this war in Israel they need
[1:08:47] to stop it because it's going to spread
[1:08:49] even greater and and you know this is
[1:08:52] going to happen and that's going to
[1:08:53] happen and and and and and nothing will
[1:08:56] happen unless God said it would amen why
[1:09:00] be afraid amen go boldly amen oh you say
[1:09:04] this seems like a paradox for you to say
[1:09:05] brother Paul but I'm telling you go
[1:09:07] boldly enough that you buy the house you
[1:09:10] plant the potatoes you seek a better job
[1:09:12] be bold enough to go forward and say I'm
[1:09:14] going to have a family and we're going
[1:09:16] to press and serve God to the coming of
[1:09:18] the Lord be bold enough to say these
[1:09:21] things are natural of life I do not have
[1:09:23] an inordinate desire for these things
[1:09:26] it's a natural thing and I'm going to
[1:09:28] walk boldly in
[1:09:29] it the spirit of fear is what holds
[1:09:32] people back I don't know I don't know I
[1:09:34] don't know well I'll tell you I know I
[1:09:37] know we have a word for the hour my
[1:09:39] brother and sister I know where our
[1:09:41] future is and the prophet of God told us
[1:09:43] our future is clear amen our future is
[1:09:47] not bound up in the spirit of leoda but
[1:09:52] imagine that you don't have that that
[1:09:55] certainty that would be a scary
[1:09:58] life that would be a challenge because
[1:10:00] you see they're under the anointing of
[1:10:03] leoda without understanding the context
[1:10:06] of the manifestation of the spirit of
[1:10:10] leoda you know it's interesting I was
[1:10:13] listening to a little deal here recently
[1:10:15] man was talking about
[1:10:17] divorce and he says you see the EB and
[1:10:20] flow of our nation he said if I knew
[1:10:23] nothing else I could just go study the
[1:10:25] divorce numbers of our
[1:10:28] nation and I could give you an idea of
[1:10:30] what's going on in our nation that's
[1:10:33] right ain't that startling wouldn't have
[1:10:35] to be a religious man just go over here
[1:10:37] and get some facts and look at them and
[1:10:39] he said I can tell you from those
[1:10:41] numbers and those numbers alone our
[1:10:43] nation is in a steady
[1:10:45] decline oh I tell you my brother and
[1:10:47] sister but if he could ever look at the
[1:10:49] new birth amen if he could ever look at
[1:10:53] that new Mar marriage that's taking
[1:10:54] place if he could ever catch a
[1:10:56] revelation that there is a bride that is
[1:10:58] espoused to her bridegroom and that
[1:11:01] number my brother and sister is growing
[1:11:03] and growing and growing it's not a
[1:11:06] declining number it's a growing number
[1:11:08] amen as more Sons and Daughters of God
[1:11:10] catch revelation of who they are and
[1:11:12] step into the vision and step into the
[1:11:15] promise that number is growing people
[1:11:17] say but but but but there's people
[1:11:18] leaving the message my brother and
[1:11:20] sister the people leaving have have
[1:11:22] nothing to do with I'm not speaking down
[1:11:24] to them but they have nothing to do with
[1:11:27] your
[1:11:28] salvation that one that says well this
[1:11:30] happened and that happened has nothing
[1:11:32] to do with you the promise The Vow is
[1:11:36] between God and you it's not between you
[1:11:39] the pastor this person that person that
[1:11:42] church it's God speaking to you God
[1:11:45] calling you God claiming you God wanting
[1:11:48] to slip the ring on your
[1:11:51] finger oh Hallelujah aren't aren't you
[1:11:53] happy this morning God my rich Mercy has
[1:11:58] come amen see they haven't even been
[1:12:03] taught scripture asks how will they know
[1:12:06] they must be
[1:12:08] taught we're not looking for
[1:12:09] intellectual
[1:12:11] Concepts we're not looking for
[1:12:13] educational programs to teach you how to
[1:12:16] be a Christian this all comes down amen
[1:12:20] I I guess I'll just warn you all now so
[1:12:21] you can be prepared we might be a little
[1:12:23] longer
[1:12:24] today amen I'm telling you this rode all
[1:12:26] the way to Belgium and rode all the way
[1:12:28] back amen so it's got a little time on
[1:12:31] it but look at it my brother and sister
[1:12:33] What's Happening Here is without
[1:12:35] teaching it all right that's why the
[1:12:38] five-fold ministry I'm not here to
[1:12:39] defend the five-fold ministry there's a
[1:12:41] whole bunch of people under that title
[1:12:43] ought to be kicked out but I'm telling
[1:12:46] you wherever God puts something down you
[1:12:48] might say in stone there's a true the
[1:12:51] prophet taught us about there's a
[1:12:52] counter we're not going to look at the
[1:12:54] counterfeit because as the counterfeit
[1:12:57] counterfeits the counterfeit it gets
[1:12:59] farther and farther from the truth but I
[1:13:02] tell you you go back to the truth and
[1:13:03] you look at the truth and you'll
[1:13:05] recognize I always was a Son of God I
[1:13:08] always was a daughter of God I don't
[1:13:10] care what this does and what that does
[1:13:13] and the lies that somebody said here and
[1:13:15] what devil tricked me into this I'm a
[1:13:18] daughter of God I'm a Son of God that's
[1:13:21] the
[1:13:22] truth
[1:13:28] but
[1:13:29] imagine never being taught that there
[1:13:32] was even a spirit of
[1:13:37] leoda where you just find yourself
[1:13:39] buffeted in
[1:13:41] life and You' have
[1:13:44] tests look I'm going to be blunt this
[1:13:46] morning I'm going to tell you right now
[1:13:47] I don't care who's here and who isn't
[1:13:49] here God laid this on my heart and I
[1:13:51] vowed to be bold my brother and sister
[1:13:54] the day of looking at what Satan tricked
[1:13:57] you
[1:13:59] into the day of looking at what someone
[1:14:03] said about you the day of looking to
[1:14:06] your
[1:14:07] flesh needs to be finished
[1:14:11] am needs to be
[1:14:13] done our flesh won't get us in a Rapture
[1:14:17] our flesh will not repair
[1:14:19] relationships our flesh will not want to
[1:14:21] get down and pray our flesh will not
[1:14:24] want to get closer to
[1:14:27] God it's time sever that relationship
[1:14:32] amen where the flesh controls your life
[1:14:34] that's
[1:14:39] right as I already said I
[1:14:42] believe Christians are looking for what
[1:14:44] God can do for
[1:14:45] them it's definitely a spirit of the age
[1:14:48] we live in but I'll tell you in spite of
[1:14:50] the challenges that we Face we need need
[1:14:53] to be focused on what we can do for God
[1:14:56] Amen we're Sons and Daughters of God can
[1:14:58] we say Amen to that have a desire in our
[1:15:01] heart amen what does that mean that
[1:15:03] means we're willing to be servants to
[1:15:05] our Lord Jesus Christ amen if we want to
[1:15:08] walk on our own my brother and sister
[1:15:10] that's not submission and that's not
[1:15:12] being a servant if you walk by your own
[1:15:14] judgment amen so when your emotion tries
[1:15:17] to tell you when your knowledge tries to
[1:15:19] tell you cause it to be subject to the
[1:15:22] word amen let us be subject to the word
[1:15:27] this is not oh don't misunderstand me
[1:15:29] I'm not talking about be subject to the
[1:15:30] word you must do this and you must do
[1:15:33] that and you have to have this and you
[1:15:35] have to have that man we're not a I hope
[1:15:37] we're not a checklist religion there was
[1:15:40] a time I grew up under an aspect of the
[1:15:42] message that was a
[1:15:45] checklist we're no longer there we've
[1:15:49] run out of list we've got the
[1:15:51] word amen we don't need the pen and the
[1:15:54] paper we don't need to check the
[1:15:56] box amen look Hallelujah when's the last
[1:16:01] time you made a
[1:16:06] mistake let me figure this
[1:16:10] out about 45 minutes
[1:16:14] ago illustration
[1:16:17] only but you see my brother and sister
[1:16:19] the devil wants you to look at that so
[1:16:20] much that you never go forward soon as I
[1:16:23] can go forward I will go forward but we
[1:16:26] can't go forward cuz we're tethered
[1:16:28] that's right I'm no
[1:16:31] longer a slave to sin that's right I'm
[1:16:34] no longer a slave to fear amen that
[1:16:37] tether's been cut off I've been
[1:16:40] delivered amen will that come around yes
[1:16:43] that's right reminds me of a man I knew
[1:16:45] he said man Paul uh what do I do we
[1:16:48] bought a house in the country and it
[1:16:50] came with a dog I guess it was there and
[1:16:54] then a week after we moved in it shows
[1:16:56] up at the doorstep and then it wants to
[1:16:58] come in the house I made some questions
[1:17:00] around the neighborhood and they said oh
[1:17:02] that dog will eat your furniture it'll
[1:17:04] kill your cats it'll do this it'll do
[1:17:06] that and they left it on
[1:17:10] purpose what do I
[1:17:12] do I said I don't know I can't tell you
[1:17:15] what I told him here in
[1:17:18] public I don't
[1:17:19] know but I wouldn't let that devil in my
[1:17:22] house that's right he looked at me
[1:17:25] devil well anything that eats Furniture
[1:17:29] has to have a spirit on it amen I would
[1:17:32] get rid of that thing and I would get
[1:17:33] rid of it on a
[1:17:35] serious measure
[1:17:39] um I would know it was gone I wouldn't
[1:17:43] hope it was gone it bites kids it kills
[1:17:47] the chickens do away with it I'm telling
[1:17:51] you my brother and sister it's it's time
[1:17:53] for us to look around our life look
[1:17:55] around our house and anything that
[1:17:57] doesn't bring Harmony and joy and peace
[1:18:00] and the presence of almighty God needs
[1:18:02] to get the
[1:18:03] axe amen that sounds a little harsh
[1:18:06] don't it but it's not time for us to
[1:18:08] have a truth with the devil it's time
[1:18:10] for us to give him an eviction notice
[1:18:12] with some force behind
[1:18:15] it amen I want to focus on what I can do
[1:18:18] for the Lord what I can do for you the
[1:18:21] body of Christ can I be an example oh
[1:18:25] you know this is a hard question to ask
[1:18:26] my brother and sister because we're
[1:18:28] human and and I I'm definitely not going
[1:18:30] to ask my wife my
[1:18:32] granddaughter my daughter son-in-law
[1:18:35] grandchildren I'm not going to ask them
[1:18:37] to be the testimony of my good example
[1:18:40] cuz you see they see me when I'm H
[1:18:43] hungry no it's not
[1:18:45] hungry
[1:18:48] hangry yeah come on you know what I'm
[1:18:52] talking talking
[1:18:56] about and the devil tell you your
[1:18:59] testimony went right out the door with
[1:19:01] the
[1:19:02] hangry but did
[1:19:04] it no cuz we're living in a world of
[1:19:07] warfare we're living in a world that
[1:19:09] Satan is constantly attacking and the
[1:19:12] True Believer recognizes and comes and
[1:19:15] reinforces that place he doesn't run
[1:19:18] from it he reinforces it and says Lord
[1:19:20] forgive me but I'm going to do better
[1:19:23] and he does Amen aren't you glad that
[1:19:25] God gives that to you that you can
[1:19:27] declare to do better and you do amen
[1:19:31] Allelujah I want to be an example to my
[1:19:33] peers I I want to be an example to the
[1:19:35] body as a whole amen maybe we could lift
[1:19:38] a hand or lift your heart this morning
[1:19:40] and say Lord I want to be a prayer
[1:19:42] Warrior I want to make a difference in
[1:19:45] this body of Believers I want to change
[1:19:47] the life of my children I want to change
[1:19:50] the world around me and if I have to
[1:19:52] become the fiercest of Warriors let me
[1:19:55] be a fierce
[1:19:57] Warrior amen I don't want to be one you
[1:20:00] know go back we spoke to the young
[1:20:02] people a little bit on the Sunday
[1:20:03] morning at the convention amen talking
[1:20:07] my brother and sister about David and
[1:20:09] Goliath oh we don't want to be the one
[1:20:11] that stands on the other side of the
[1:20:13] valley and shakes our sword oh
[1:20:17] devil but we want to be like David and
[1:20:20] we want to March right down into the
[1:20:23] oh you could maybe describe it as a
[1:20:25] valley of a shadow of death because
[1:20:27] David had Faith but David did not know
[1:20:30] the future and he went right down there
[1:20:33] and David come down now the scripture
[1:20:35] says he came to a brook and picked up
[1:20:37] five stones but I'm telling you he came
[1:20:40] to the River of Life he come right down
[1:20:42] to the river of life and he met Jesus
[1:20:45] down there he met Faith down there and
[1:20:48] he knew when he picked up that that
[1:20:51] Jesus was with him and he had had faith
[1:20:53] in the word and he walked from that
[1:20:55] River of Life and went right out there
[1:20:57] in the face of the enemy my brother and
[1:20:59] sister we weren't never called to crawl
[1:21:01] in the mud and wrestle the devil amen we
[1:21:04] were called to deal with him at the arms
[1:21:07] length as it were to say stand your
[1:21:10] ground I'm here to defeat you
[1:21:12] today cuz like the old saying says if
[1:21:15] you wrestle in the mud with a
[1:21:18] pig you get dirty and he likes
[1:21:21] it right
[1:21:28] Hallelujah don't you love the human
[1:21:31] psych using the word psych over the
[1:21:33] pulpit probably gets you branded as some
[1:21:35] kind of weird person but let me tell
[1:21:39] you I believe in
[1:21:42] that I've got the mind of Christ
[1:21:45] Hallelujah not my mind it's his mind he
[1:21:49] didn't have to come down here and say
[1:21:50] now I'm going to reshape your mind he
[1:21:52] I'm going to make you a new creature
[1:21:54] amen that's got my mind amen are you
[1:21:57] with me don't want to leave any weird
[1:22:00] Vibes behind but when we come to that
[1:22:03] place my brother and sister that we have
[1:22:04] to resort to saying this that's
[1:22:06] happening is psychology and that over
[1:22:09] there is emotion and this over here is
[1:22:11] this why don't we quit the label and ask
[1:22:14] God lord if this is what I need to come
[1:22:17] closer to you then reveal it to me and
[1:22:19] let me come closer I want to get closer
[1:22:22] amen man I'll tell you let me put it
[1:22:24] back to this little romance right here
[1:22:26] I'll tell you the first time that a
[1:22:28] young man ever starts paying attention
[1:22:31] rightful attention to a young lady amen
[1:22:34] she might like him and she might be
[1:22:36] wanting to receive that but it's still a
[1:22:39] change to her to have some young man
[1:22:42] look her in the face and say I think I
[1:22:44] love you you have to go process
[1:22:48] that might process it and say I like
[1:22:51] that nothing wrong with that
[1:22:53] right
[1:22:57] right but you want to see something
[1:22:59] strange is when somebody expresses their
[1:23:03] undying love and they hardly even know
[1:23:06] your
[1:23:09] name makes me nervous and I'm grown
[1:23:14] up Satan doesn't care about who you
[1:23:17] are your heart your desire your
[1:23:20] direction in life
[1:23:23] he will tell you how much he loves you
[1:23:26] till he's got
[1:23:27] you go stud study the pattern then he
[1:23:31] turns into an
[1:23:34] abuser the prophet of God
[1:23:37] said that if a young man truly loved you
[1:23:39] young ladies look at me
[1:23:41] sisters Prophet says if a young man
[1:23:44] truly loved
[1:23:47] you and you love someone
[1:23:50] else he may still love
[1:23:53] you but he'll be a gentleman and he'll
[1:23:56] step back from that
[1:23:59] relationship because he loves you enough
[1:24:02] to let you be
[1:24:04] happy now I want you to think about the
[1:24:08] devil the devil loves you enough to take
[1:24:13] you but he could care less whether
[1:24:16] you're
[1:24:19] happy but my Lord my Lord Lord comes and
[1:24:23] he speaks to me in so many ways I I
[1:24:25] could tell you this trip everything
[1:24:27] we've went uh you know we all have our
[1:24:29] experience we've went to museums we rode
[1:24:32] the subway we saw the Eiffel Tower it's
[1:24:34] not all they crack it up to
[1:24:36] be
[1:24:40] amen that big old Arch I'll tell you
[1:24:42] what I Remember by that big arch in the
[1:24:44] middle of Paris it's surrounded by
[1:24:47] hundreds of crazy people in
[1:24:50] cars people who call you names and give
[1:24:53] gestures to you and shout and scream and
[1:24:56] beat on their own steering wheel that's
[1:24:58] what I remember of the arc or archd
[1:25:01] Triumph or whatever didn't look like
[1:25:04] there was any Victory
[1:25:08] there you see that's what the world we
[1:25:11] live in I ask a lot of people what do
[1:25:13] you think about Paris and they're like
[1:25:15] they're crazy over
[1:25:17] there but they also call it a gym of the
[1:25:20] world yeah whose
[1:25:25] gy Jesus Christ said you're the gy of my
[1:25:29] world you don't need chaos you don't
[1:25:32] need crazy you don't need all this you
[1:25:33] need me amen amen and there's a true
[1:25:37] Arch of Triumph right there Hallelujah
[1:25:41] you know there's so much to understand
[1:25:42] about ourselves I love this the
[1:25:43] naysayers of the message they can speak
[1:25:46] down on the message but they can't even
[1:25:47] Define their own
[1:25:49] self I'm sorry I I I refuse to accept a
[1:25:53] critical mass
[1:25:56] decision from a crazy
[1:25:58] person am I speaking too blunt this
[1:26:01] morning I'm sorry you don't even know
[1:26:03] which direction you're going You're a
[1:26:05] gyro Chopper out of control I'm going to
[1:26:08] do this I'm going to do this I'm going
[1:26:09] to do
[1:26:12] this but you shouldn't do that no come
[1:26:15] on that's it come on let's just
[1:26:17] understand this there's so much to
[1:26:18] understand of our own self of those
[1:26:20] around us but let's look at it in
[1:26:22] spiritual sense I want to know where I
[1:26:24] fit in the family I want to know where I
[1:26:27] fit in this body of Christ because when
[1:26:29] I find my proper place in the body of
[1:26:31] Christ my brother and sister that only
[1:26:33] comes by Revelation right amen that you
[1:26:35] don't just figure this out where you fit
[1:26:38] in the body when you start trying to
[1:26:40] figure out where you fit in the body is
[1:26:42] when the devil starts throwing little
[1:26:43] things in there and you start thinking
[1:26:45] Well I this and I that and and I I must
[1:26:48] not be nobody I must be a nothing or you
[1:26:51] might think I'm the greatest of all but
[1:26:54] when God gives revelation we can find
[1:26:56] ourselves fitting right into this body
[1:26:59] and we realize this body is not complete
[1:27:01] without me Can someone say Amen this
[1:27:04] morning this body is not complete
[1:27:06] without me I don't care if I'm the least
[1:27:10] or maybe God would bless me to be one of
[1:27:12] the greatest it doesn't matter it's not
[1:27:15] complete without me and I'm going to be
[1:27:18] part of that body cuz I have a
[1:27:20] revelation of a complete body that's
[1:27:22] right
[1:27:24] amen hallelujah I hope you guys don't
[1:27:26] mind me bringing this up but it's about
[1:27:29] time for us to get our complexes out in
[1:27:31] the open that's right you know what we
[1:27:33] do as
[1:27:34] humans we hide that complex people only
[1:27:37] see a little shadow of our
[1:27:40] complex we're in Belgium we're talking
[1:27:43] about
[1:27:45] dogs and it was kind of interesting
[1:27:48] conversation you know oh you know little
[1:27:51] dogs are okay okay big dogs scare me
[1:27:54] well you realize statistically speaking
[1:27:56] that little dogs bite more often than
[1:27:58] big dogs do that's right so you love the
[1:28:01] biter and you're afraid of the
[1:28:07] liquor and then a brother brother Johan
[1:28:11] was like well I'll tell you I don't
[1:28:12] necessarily like big dogs they got a
[1:28:14] mouth about this size and one of them
[1:28:15] wrapped its face around my face and
[1:28:17] that's why my whole lip and
[1:28:20] doxing yeah
[1:28:22] well steal my
[1:28:25] thunder thing wrapped its face around my
[1:28:28] face split my lip wide open they had to
[1:28:32] sew it all together and now he has this
[1:28:34] and you can tell he has a complex sorry
[1:28:36] brother Johan he listens to our
[1:28:42] services big or
[1:28:44] little does the complex
[1:28:51] matter big or
[1:28:53] little come on my brother and sister can
[1:28:56] I ask you as your friend as your pastor
[1:28:59] it's time for us to get our complexes
[1:29:00] out in the open and just acknowledge I
[1:29:02] have an issue with this I'm not talking
[1:29:05] about shaming yourself but I'm saying
[1:29:07] you know what I I've got a complex about
[1:29:09] this somebody said something about me at
[1:29:11] one time and I guess I kind of believed
[1:29:14] them and I I don't want to I I I want to
[1:29:16] be free of this somebody said you'll
[1:29:19] never amount to much as a Christian
[1:29:23] something anchored down
[1:29:24] it and you go through struggle after
[1:29:27] struggle after struggle and that echoes
[1:29:30] in your mind I'll never be much of a
[1:29:35] Christian but what you don't know is
[1:29:38] that Christian right beside
[1:29:40] you who has never told those words still
[1:29:45] battles the same
[1:29:48] complex because that is leoda
[1:29:54] that is the spirit of the age demeaning
[1:30:00] undermining
[1:30:02] amen you know do we really have a
[1:30:06] revelation that every devil and hell's
[1:30:08] been turned loose against us yes sir I I
[1:30:11] think a lot of us don't
[1:30:13] though I think a lot of us can't imagine
[1:30:16] now let's take gesi he's there and he he
[1:30:19] tells Elisha we are surrounded
[1:30:22] yeah I think what we need is a prophetic
[1:30:25] word to open our eyes amen we have that
[1:30:28] prophetic word but I think some of us
[1:30:30] are a little slow at opening our eyes
[1:30:33] that we look at what's going on in the
[1:30:34] world and we're like oh
[1:30:38] Lord come
[1:30:40] on there's more for us than there is
[1:30:42] against us it's time for us to say look
[1:30:45] devil I'm sorry you come to this fight
[1:30:48] outnumbered amen I'm sorry you didn't
[1:30:50] bring your best when you came here oh
[1:30:54] you need to respect the devil amen you
[1:30:56] need to respect the devil don't don't
[1:30:58] just act like he's nothing you're going
[1:30:59] to blow him off the only thing he
[1:31:01] respect is the word that's right he
[1:31:04] doesn't respect one other thing but the
[1:31:06] word that's right amen every lion
[1:31:12] Spirit you ever meet
[1:31:14] them
[1:31:16] yes now this was a little something that
[1:31:19] I spoke there in Belgium and I hope you
[1:31:22] can follow this but you know David was
[1:31:24] out in the pasture with his
[1:31:28] sheep and a lion
[1:31:31] come a lion
[1:31:36] Spirit tried to lie to
[1:31:39] David but I love that goes back to some
[1:31:43] child Fable thing every hair on your
[1:31:46] chinny chin chin he grabs that lion by
[1:31:49] the hairs of his chin and he defeats
[1:31:52] that
[1:31:54] Lon but wasn't there another spirit that
[1:31:56] come to David out in the
[1:31:58] pasture what was
[1:32:02] it have you seen and met the bare
[1:32:06] spirit I don't want to confuse you but
[1:32:10] the prophet of God all the way back into
[1:32:13] 1957 so there'll come a time that it
[1:32:16] once was we went to them Paris meaning
[1:32:20] and got their clothes and got their
[1:32:22] stuff and we have been so demoralized
[1:32:25] and taken down they now come to us
[1:32:28] that's right that bear spirit is
[1:32:33] everywhere they think it's Beauty to
[1:32:35] Bear it
[1:32:37] all that's right but David defeated that
[1:32:40] Spirit also no Doctrine here okay please
[1:32:43] nobody go away saying brother Paul just
[1:32:45] introduced a new doctrine in the
[1:32:47] message but you see my brother and
[1:32:49] sister what are the odds you're going to
[1:32:51] meet Al line
[1:32:52] in your front yard or maybe more so your
[1:32:55] backyard because you have
[1:32:58] privacy not very you're not going to
[1:33:01] meet a bear but there's a lot of Lon
[1:33:03] spirits around there's a lot of spirits
[1:33:06] that are trying to get everyone to Bear
[1:33:08] it
[1:33:09] all well the only thing that we're
[1:33:11] called to do is take it to Jesus amen
[1:33:16] amen I got off track there didn't
[1:33:19] I amen now look at that Philippians 4:13
[1:33:23] says I can do all things through Christ
[1:33:25] which strengtheneth me do we believe
[1:33:27] that amen amen we have more Revelation
[1:33:30] in this age than there's ever been in
[1:33:32] any age the culmination of Revelation
[1:33:35] which is a climax and this is not an
[1:33:38] intellectual Revelation my brother and
[1:33:39] sister amen and this is not connected to
[1:33:43] something that's outside of the word in
[1:33:44] other words extra biblical we don't have
[1:33:46] to come and dig out some book of
[1:33:48] astrology or whatever you know the
[1:33:51] prophet of God God talked about
[1:33:52] astrology but he didn't make that a
[1:33:53] foundation of our faith amen he didn't
[1:33:56] let's say now as long as the astrology
[1:33:58] all lines up amen you got the Holy Ghost
[1:34:00] he said no repent and be baptized you
[1:34:02] get the Holy Ghost don't study an
[1:34:04] astrology chart don't study what
[1:34:06] somebody else has got to do people are
[1:34:08] like well you know the the Magi they
[1:34:10] were they were led by astrology you know
[1:34:12] so if if brother brandom's quoting them
[1:34:15] and speaking that there must be some
[1:34:16] kind of astrology
[1:34:20] thing
[1:34:23] are we far enough down the road in
[1:34:24] maturity to say you poor ignorant people
[1:34:26] that's
[1:34:28] right you think this is what we get out
[1:34:31] of the
[1:34:33] Bible prophet of God said find yourself
[1:34:36] in the Bible he didn't say go over and
[1:34:37] find yourself in a book of astrology
[1:34:39] that's right he said find yourself in
[1:34:41] the
[1:34:42] Bible and to find yourself in the Bible
[1:34:45] you got to be in the Bible amen amen
[1:34:47] it's much better if you just become the
[1:34:49] Bible you just become the word than and
[1:34:51] the Lord said I'll lead you and guide
[1:34:53] you into truth amen now look at this I
[1:34:55] preached on this quite a bit and you
[1:34:56] guys will just bear with me but 99 times
[1:34:59] brother random talks about reading
[1:35:01] between the lines now not all of this is
[1:35:03] in an absolute spiritual context but
[1:35:06] you'll go if you study loud you'll find
[1:35:08] that the prophet of God's talking about
[1:35:09] reading between the lines he's making
[1:35:11] example of a letter from his wife and
[1:35:14] he's there on the mission field and he
[1:35:16] opens this letter and in there she's
[1:35:18] saying well you know Bill I I put the
[1:35:20] kids to bed laundry is all done and the
[1:35:22] dishes are all done and I'm sitting here
[1:35:25] missing you the prophet of God uses that
[1:35:28] as an analogy to say or show you how it
[1:35:32] is to read between the lines cuz he
[1:35:35] knows what she's saying he she he knows
[1:35:38] what she was meaning when she pinned
[1:35:40] those words he
[1:35:42] knows somebody else might read the
[1:35:44] letter and go oh wow the house is all
[1:35:46] tidy you know brother bram's not there
[1:35:48] to enjoy it but uh you know kids are out
[1:35:51] of the way way and the laundry and the
[1:35:52] dishes and everything uh now she can
[1:35:55] just do whatever she wants no no without
[1:35:58] Revelation you can't read between that
[1:36:00] line but with Revelation you can read
[1:36:02] between that line amen and so the
[1:36:04] prophet speaks of these things and my
[1:36:06] brother and sister this all ties in had
[1:36:09] a lovely conversation amen uh with many
[1:36:13] brothers but our brother David iers I
[1:36:15] just really had a lovely time but you
[1:36:17] see my brother and sister when God
[1:36:19] starts to move you has got moved any of
[1:36:22] you when God starts to move you in a
[1:36:24] certain direction God didn't take you so
[1:36:28] you would go over there and say um I've
[1:36:31] been
[1:36:34] here God's got something for you amen
[1:36:38] God never LED Israel aimlessly in the
[1:36:43] desert Israel LED Israel aimlessly in
[1:36:48] the
[1:36:49] desert but you can study right in the
[1:36:51] word of God and see that they actually
[1:36:53] blamed God for their journey in the
[1:36:55] wilderness that Journey was their
[1:36:57] Journey that was not God's Journey but
[1:36:59] ultimately God used it and this is going
[1:37:01] to be
[1:37:02] rough hang on we should have installed
[1:37:05] those seat belts here in the
[1:37:07] church their
[1:37:09] parents had to go the way their parents
[1:37:13] desired to
[1:37:16] go and a new generation rose
[1:37:19] up and when jhua spoke to
[1:37:22] them they had reference
[1:37:25] point I've been
[1:37:27] there I saw my grandpa fall in the
[1:37:30] wilderness I saw my grandmother fall in
[1:37:32] the wilderness I saw my mother fall in
[1:37:34] the wilderness I saw my father fall in
[1:37:36] the
[1:37:37] wilderness I'm not going to fall I'm
[1:37:41] going to stand on this word there was a
[1:37:43] promise that was given God did not
[1:37:46] change his promise he did not change his
[1:37:49] word because of your circumstance
[1:37:52] his word is solid and God said I've got
[1:37:55] a people that are going to follow the
[1:37:58] promise and they're not going to follow
[1:38:00] the circumstance they're not going to
[1:38:02] look over here and say mom and dad quit
[1:38:04] I'm quitting they're not going to look
[1:38:06] over here and say my friends have quit
[1:38:08] I'm quitting they're going to say this
[1:38:10] is a promise of God this is a word of
[1:38:13] the hour for me and I believe it and
[1:38:16] I'll stand on
[1:38:19] it so strong my brother and sister so
[1:38:23] strong it's blunt but I think we're
[1:38:26] getting to an age that we probably need
[1:38:29] to be a little more blunt than we've
[1:38:31] been we need to start calling Sin Sin
[1:38:35] instead of saying an
[1:38:39] understanding that's how they understand
[1:38:45] it I need to keep to my
[1:38:48] notes now look
[1:38:52] as we see this my brother and sister I'm
[1:38:53] going to move forward in First Kings
[1:38:57] 17 we see under this Elijah anointing
[1:39:01] amen now
[1:39:03] remember God may take the man but he
[1:39:05] never takes the spirit right the Elijah
[1:39:08] anointing that took place Mount Carmel
[1:39:10] all of that is right here still today
[1:39:12] same anointing same power of God the
[1:39:15] same promise of the word the
[1:39:18] same obedience on God's part
[1:39:21] to his own
[1:39:23] word isn't that amazing God would hold
[1:39:26] himself to an account that he'd say if I
[1:39:28] want them to believe it and act on it
[1:39:30] then I will act on it amen not a double
[1:39:33] standard I I
[1:39:35] shared met I appreciate everyone who
[1:39:38] come down and helped clean the parking
[1:39:39] lot on my way to the parking lot on
[1:39:41] Friday to the
[1:39:43] church traveling down Orchard coming up
[1:39:46] on an intersection I see a car coming
[1:39:49] from the left breaks slows down turns
[1:39:52] the corner never comes to a complete
[1:39:55] halt in front of me is a sheriff's
[1:39:58] deputy he comes down to the stop sign
[1:40:00] breaks never comes to Halt drives
[1:40:03] through it in the middle of the
[1:40:04] intersection turns his lights on does a
[1:40:06] U-turn that's perfectly legal
[1:40:09] right not in the state of Idaho it's
[1:40:13] not and then he goes and I'm quite
[1:40:15] certain he was going to give a ticket to
[1:40:19] the person who ran the stop sign while
[1:40:21] he himself is guilty of the
[1:40:26] same now I'm not talking to people like
[1:40:30] you I'm talking to
[1:40:34] you how many times have we
[1:40:39] judged and we ran the stop sign that's
[1:40:41] right God help us that's right it's time
[1:40:45] for us to stand up and say Lord forgive
[1:40:47] me I'm not going to hide under the cloak
[1:40:49] of your word I'm not going to hide hide
[1:40:51] under a cloak of the message I want to
[1:40:53] live the word I want to be the message I
[1:40:57] don't want to hide in it I want to be it
[1:41:00] amen now we look over here in First
[1:41:03] Kings amen Elijah anointed he's there
[1:41:07] all that happened now he's up there and
[1:41:09] it's there that he is enjoying life as
[1:41:12] much as a prophet can there's always
[1:41:14] burdens for them to bury uh uh I mean
[1:41:17] carry um and so God just one day says
[1:41:20] I'm going to use the natural
[1:41:21] circumstance of life there's a drought
[1:41:23] in the land and all of a sudden the
[1:41:26] brook is just
[1:41:28] declining until there's
[1:41:31] nothing and those faithful
[1:41:35] Ravens where' they
[1:41:38] go what's
[1:41:42] happening the Devil comes and says God's
[1:41:45] abandoned you I felt that in my
[1:41:48] teens I literally did I'm not even
[1:41:51] trying to serve God I'm just doing my
[1:41:53] own thing but I would always put out
[1:41:54] these little uh I look back on them and
[1:41:56] think how silly but I'd put these things
[1:41:58] out now Lord if you want me to serve you
[1:42:01] let this and this and this
[1:42:03] happen didn't
[1:42:06] happen you imagine what would happen if
[1:42:09] it
[1:42:10] did Lord if you want me to serve
[1:42:13] you let this happen next time it's going
[1:42:17] to be a little bigger let this happen
[1:42:20] next time it's a little bigger let this
[1:42:22] happen now Lord if you really love
[1:42:25] me you know what we'd be com spoiled
[1:42:30] brats that our whole salvation was built
[1:42:34] on what God could give
[1:42:38] us instead God comes to a prophet drives
[1:42:42] up the
[1:42:43] brook and the prophet starts to
[1:42:46] move I don't think he probably was happy
[1:42:49] praise God I was tired of this lovely
[1:42:52] Mountain View with my own private
[1:42:55] cave God moves him he starts down there
[1:42:58] what is there a Divine appointment
[1:43:01] aren't you glad God gives out Divine
[1:43:03] appointments he gave me one time amen he
[1:43:06] gave you one one time amen a Divine
[1:43:09] appointment and we see in First Kings 17
[1:43:12] amen he walks down into town and you
[1:43:15] know here's a town that is just forsaken
[1:43:18] it is desolate there's hungry people
[1:43:21] there's not history says there was not
[1:43:22] even hardly the reason there is emphasis
[1:43:25] in the scripture of her going out to
[1:43:27] pick up a stick or two is because all
[1:43:29] the sticks had been picked up it wasn't
[1:43:31] like a big F pile of firewood out in the
[1:43:33] driveway she had to go find a couple
[1:43:35] little sticks to light a fire to take
[1:43:38] the last little bit of meal and the last
[1:43:40] little bit of oil and make a little cake
[1:43:43] for her and her son and her confession
[1:43:46] was after this we're going to
[1:43:49] die that don't sound too positive does
[1:43:52] it that doesn't sound too encouraging
[1:43:55] but God knew what it would take to catch
[1:43:58] her heart amen and so here it is Elijah
[1:44:02] comes and says hey that's fine but make
[1:44:05] me a cake
[1:44:08] first now I need to hurry through here
[1:44:10] so I don't keep you too long but my
[1:44:12] brother and sister let me just cut this
[1:44:13] to the chase God was not challenging the
[1:44:16] natural this was not about dividing the

[1:44:23] her faith to trust him God challenged
[1:44:27] her can you believe my Prophet can you
[1:44:30] believe the word for this hour and
[1:44:33] something oh it's there you see it in

[1:44:39] do that
[1:44:42] yeah but something
[1:44:44] inside
[1:44:46] clicked and she goes over here and she
[1:44:50] takes oil she takes flour she makes a a
[1:44:54] cake for the
[1:44:55] prophet what was it my brother and
[1:44:57] sister it wasn't a natural resignation
[1:45:01] that I'm going to die anyway I might as
[1:45:02] well help this guy it was a faith
[1:45:06] movement it was a challenge to her faith
[1:45:09] to believe and this is God's Prophet
[1:45:12] speaking to me saying feed me first give
[1:45:15] your portion to God first I'll take care
[1:45:19] of you and so she makes the cake she
[1:45:22] gives it an imagine oh praise God I can

[1:45:29] her own self and there's just as much
[1:45:31] flour as when she divided it to God it
[1:45:34] wasn't to Elijah she gave that to God
[1:45:38] God challenged her faith she responded
[1:45:40] and she gave it back and God said that's
[1:45:43] fine I bless you imagine how she must
[1:45:46] have marveled when she went to pour some
[1:45:48] more flour out and said it down and it
[1:45:51] looked just as full she poured some oil
[1:45:53] out set it down and it was just as full

[1:54:35] you can find it Amen brother Matthew
[1:54:38] Watkin shares testimony of a friend of
[1:54:42] his friend amen you might have seen it
[1:54:45] it's it's it's shared at uh evening
[1:54:48] light in Louisiana
[1:54:50] this man was a minister this man was
[1:54:53] active in the church and it's
[1:54:55] irregardless but he was a black man and
[1:54:59] uh he give up he's dying got huge tumor
[1:55:03] on his neck are you familiar with it
[1:55:05] amen now look what happens my brother
[1:55:08] and sister that
[1:55:11] man a faithful man of
[1:55:14] God under the curse where the doctors
[1:55:17] say there's nothing we can do for you
[1:55:19] had tumor on his neck there's pictures
[1:55:22] this is not a story this is life and he
[1:55:24] had tumors on his legs and the calves of
[1:55:26] his legs and his whole body was just
[1:55:28] this big black
[1:55:30] image and this friend of brother Matt's
[1:55:32] this brother in the church was friends
[1:55:35] with him says brother Matt come with me
[1:55:36] go they go there they're talking to the
[1:55:39] man and the man says well I never
[1:55:42] thought it would end this way but I
[1:55:44] guess this would be God's
[1:55:46] Will and they sat down and started going
[1:55:49] into the the word with him amen and if
[1:55:52] you're not familiar with this go study
[1:55:53] it out it's
[1:55:55] powerful they brought up I think even
[1:55:58] maybe played it on the phone the
[1:55:59] testimony of sister Elena
[1:56:01] buts now I hope this doesn't shock some
[1:56:04] of you but I'll tell you I've just had a
[1:56:06] transformation in the last while no I
[1:56:08] didn't go run off jump off a cliff but
[1:56:10] also as our brother Matt preached to the
[1:56:12] young people I'm tired of being either
[1:56:14] in this ditch or that ditch I'm tired of
[1:56:18] people saying it's either this way is
[1:56:20] this way well I'm here to tell you
[1:56:21] there's something right down the center
[1:56:23] that's according to the word it is the
[1:56:25] word I maybe don't always understand it
[1:56:28] but I tell you God dealt with sister
[1:56:30] Elena and she got down there and was
[1:56:32] dancing before the Lord she didn't care
[1:56:36] if there was a congregation seeing her
[1:56:39] she didn't care who was watching her on
[1:56:41] the internet the Lord said dance and she
[1:56:46] danced and some would say oh I don't
[1:56:48] know about the to dancing well if God
[1:56:51] said dance I want to dance and if God
[1:56:53] Says dance I want to see you dance we're
[1:56:56] not dancing to make a show we're not
[1:56:58] dancing to be some kind of spectacle but
[1:57:01] when God speaks and God heals sister
[1:57:04] Elena and they share that testimony with
[1:57:07] this man and they're there we just want
[1:57:09] to encourage your faith believe God Is A
[1:57:13] Healer I won't go into the whole story
[1:57:15] they go on some
[1:57:17] time and then one day that man 's wife
[1:57:21] calls up brother Matt's friend brother
[1:57:23] in the church and says I got a picture
[1:57:26] I'm going to send
[1:57:27] you and those of you familiar with the
[1:57:29] testimony will see a man that had goers
[1:57:33] hanging on his body and looked like he
[1:57:36] was
[1:57:37] old in this picture it's quite handsome
[1:57:41] actually I wished I kind of had that cut
[1:57:43] that he has and the picture he's
[1:57:45] standing
[1:57:47] there this picture
[1:57:50] of the prime of
[1:57:52] life God healed me
[1:57:56] amen oh if you're a message believer God
[1:57:59] does that if you can have enough faith
[1:58:01] God will do that but the prophet of God
[1:58:04] said every bit of faith that you need to
[1:58:07] make the Rapture is already in you let
[1:58:11] it be released Lord please release it

[1:58:41] morning oh the devil will challenge your
[1:58:44] faith to believe that but I'm here to

[1:58:49] more for us than there is against us
