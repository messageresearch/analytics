another little chorus to sing but that's come on brother under this anointing come on Hallelujah God bless you God thank you brother praise God Amen let's go back to that song and let's sing that chorus and make it very personal am in Jesus name I press on Amen because that's really what God is doing in our lives my brother and sister in a personal experience amen we are collectively the body of Christ but in a personal experience you have to identify in the personal position amen you have to come and say well we collectively as a church Grace we're going to take a Rapture well that might be so but you've got to inside the confines of that identify yourself Amen in Jesus name I press on yes Lord in Jesus name I press on and on with the pr oh that's clear before my eyes I find the

worship and say thank you Lord for lord it's not me Lord but it's Christ in me and I say thank you today Lord that you would come and dwell in US Lord that you would come and move in our midst you would come and speak to us father how precious you are Lord and we thank you for that Lord my mind always takes me back lord through the scripture when there was victory in the camp in Israel Lord there was a shout and Lord let our voices be lifted before you today in a shout that we have victory in the camp there is victory in this bride of Christ there's victory in Grace Tabernacle there's victory in the lives of the believer today Lord we say thank you thank you thank you thank you Lord Jesus we lift our hands and our hearts in praise to you oh Hallelujah may your Victory father your Victory be upon our lips all the time oh Hallelujah Lord we thank you we thank you hallelujah thank you Lord Jesus thank you Lord Jesus hallelujah amen good to be here today Saints Hallelujah God is so good to us I think if we in the flesh could ever truly recognize just how good God is to us amen we would never have a sour note another sour moment we'd never have a frown but sometimes the devil he just brings things in such a way and you know what he does he never comes and says I'm the devil he comes in our own thoughts in our [Music] emotion and he places the blame on us never claiming it for himself it's always about what you failed to do well devil let me remind you today that when the word went through Heaven you failed to believe it so you are the original I just was reading this brother Brown I'm talking about this the devil is the original unbeliever that's right so when he starts talking about unbelief he should know amen amen but we're not amen hallelujah we were not created to be unbelievers never moveed to manifest the life of the unbeliever we were called to be Believers can we say Lord I'm a Believer this morning I believe your word today Lord It's a confession of my lips it's the thoughts of my heart it's everything that you created me to be Hallelujah believer well brother Paul how is that well you see Saints it's so simple God just hid it right in the word and he just created Me and You In His Image that's it he's not an unbeliever I I will try to share this but uh brother Stan sends his greetings to you brother Stan sister Merlene brother Stan sent me a just wonderful little video clip you have to approach it in the right mindset you might say not view the man that's sharing this as a theologian but um I will I will share it and I no doubt it will spread its way through the church and if you don't get it just ask because you see this man is laying this out my brother and sister that God is on such a different plane that we are we keep trying to bring him down to our level yeah instead of just giving him Liberty Amen to bring us up to his level we try to explain God In Time but God is Not time amen God is eternal he can't even operate on the plane of time it it'll be good I think it'll bless your hearts amen good to be here let's remember our sister April um you know just uh I I I don't want to speak in a public forum in that sense but just lots of little things happening you know uh you know um you know somebody I just saw this little deal the other day and it you can apply it to everything but it says what do hospitals uh have in common with the rest of the world it's called politics and um so just pray for sister April as she has to work in that atmosphere where where you know there's a lot of unbelief a lot of things there but let her life be a witness let it be a representation I didn't even know brother Trevor was gone anywhere so I I guess I'll just have to welcome him home early amen uh so God bless you each and every one I I felt bad brother manasse come and uh and I didn't get connected with him and I kept saying I was going to call him telling myself this and uh me doesn't always listen to me and um so I I didn't get him called but God bless him um I would just like to um speak to you today uh in this here the changing of the seasons you know me and the iPad are not agreeing here um Allelujah of course you know maybe iPads are a little closer as spiritual than we think they they won't let you just touch anywhere on the screen they you have to be precise You' got to touch the right spot amen hallelujah I want to speak to you this morning uh I first off here I'm I'm a little scatterbrained so there's this family that live up north and there're these wonderful people and they're really nice people and sweet people and uh we're happy to have them people here today and I want to just welcome each and every one uh in the wol family's cousins coming together and and uh traveling and being here and and we're just happy to have each one of you and uh God bless you um you know it's one thing I I say this in a context so understand me I'm finding Liberty in getting older because I'm suddenly things like you know being concerned about how people look at you accept you it's slowly falling away you can be a little more blunt and not go home and beat yourself up over it and um you know uh I just be blunt today my brother and sister we should only have in the context of what we're speaking today we should only have one goal in this life period that's it now if God blesses you speaking a little bit to the young adults on this if God blesses you and you have a good job good career good future amen that's all well and good but when you stand like the Rich Young Ruler one day you would give your kingdom just to have them dip their finger in the water and bring it and here's our time here's our season let's not waste it amen let's let's just not let the things of this world the cares of this world the joy and pleasure of this world actually when brother randam describes it to us as Satan's Eden he hid it so Square on the head that as it would be as a carpenter uh used to frame houses you know your goal when you were working you got paid by the square foot of framing a house house and your goal would be to drive the nail home as quickly as possible to move on and that's what we need to do in this day we need to drive the nail home get it settled that we're we're we're just done it's clenched and nothing's going to shake that or pull that loose and and uh that's really ought to be our complete priority of the day fashion and pleasure and all of these things are nothing but the devil's distraction and I know that doesn't sound very blunt but uh sometimes that can be a little straightforward uh let's let's make sure that we understand what's going on around us amen I want to speak to you on the changing of the seasons and um I want to also I'm I'm just really kicked about here let me back up brother Jose Hernandez is coming down from Tri Cities next Sunday going to speak for the church here and I believe you'll be blessed I every time brother Jose comes he just brings it in his way and I it's just I always enjoy that just the Simplicity of the gospel and the Simplicity of the Gospel doesn't mean the man bringing it is simple it's just the word broke down in a form that is readily acceptable for us amen and so youth group will be moved back a week to January 19th and I don't know brother Isaac I maybe got the cart in front of the horse here but he was talking something about having some kind of a uh uh a little thing and I will leave that uh for brother Isaac to announce uh but I believe that would be the Friday before is that kind of what you his mind so uh be looking for brother Isaac to make an announcement uh concerning all the musicians and uh and what forth here amen this evening uh I don't know the official start of this evening will be 6:00 p.m. and then uh those who want to come a a little earlier 5:30 or something like that more than welcome amen we want a little more time to Fellowship then come a little earlier uh I think that we're going to have a very simple finger food type of a atmosphere maybe um uh sister Jerry's got potatoes she needs to get rid of before we go to Belgium so I think we're having some potato soup amen see we all have a different perspective how we look at things right she looks at it like I want to make potato soup and looking at it like oh she needs to get rid of these potatoes so anyway um the service will start 7:30 not exactly pinpointed doesn't have to be um absolute but we don't want to miss that Mark and then 8:30 or so or very soon after we will have communion let's turn in our bibles if we would this morning 2 Corinthians the 5th chapter 17th verse through the 21st verse amen amen hopefully you all brought your Bibles amen you should never go to church unarmed amen would desire your prayers as we go to Belgium um for traveling mercies got many thoughts on my heart uh as we will be one of the speakers there in the Newport uh youth convention uh just want God to move in a supernatural Mighty way amongst the young people there they're coming from a multitude of countries all the way down I I think um Zimbabwe and what not all over Europe quite a few from the United States Canada uh whatnot just quite a quite a broad Gathering there and we just really want to see a supernatural move of God amongst the young people and uh you know the word shows us very clearly that Satan he focuses on the young people because he wants to counter the word and the word said train up a child amen and so Satan's going to train up children and our children are not his children so he has no right to try and train our children so we just want God to come and move in a supernatural way on these young people from all these different countries and uh that God would just speak and uh so we certainly coverage your prayers in this time therefore If any man be in Christ he is a new creature old things are passed away behold all things become new and all things are of God who hath reconciled us to himself by Jesus Christ and hath given to us the ministry of reconciliation to it that God was in Christ reconciling the world unto himself not imputing their trespasses unto them and hath committed unto us the word of reconciliation you know this can be taken out in a long path my brother and sister but the word of Recon ilation also connects to Pardon so God's pardoned us there is no sin to be held to our account we've been pardoned amen Can someone say thank you Lord hallelujah and we're not going to be amongst those as the story brother Brown tells about the young man who doesn't believe in the pardon rejects the pardon and then is shot by the firing squad and it goes to court and they rule a pardon is not a pardon unless it's received or accepted as a pardon I receive the pardon this morning Lord let it touch my life and all the power of your word now then we are ambassadors for Christ did I just read what I read yes sir amen we are now yes sir ambassadors right as though God did beseech You by us we pray you in Christ stead be ye reconciled to God for he hath made him to be sin for us who knew no sin that we might be made the righteousness of God in him Lord we thank you for the reading Lord we thank you for the word that we can read Lord a lifechanging word father and we receive it today in the name of Jesus Christ guide our words our thoughts our Deeds today we ask Lord in your name amen you may be seated Saints brother Isaac and I was just visiting the other day a little bit and you know you get busy in life and sometimes you don't realize uh really what's happening and he brought it to my attention my brother and sister it may only be by seconds but um the days are getting longer so we've had a change of seasons right here now when you wake up you know with all this Frost and the ground is frozen and whatever it's hard to say there's a change in season coming it it you don't recognize that so much but the changing of the season now a changing of a season is a period of time amen that is marked when there is a a a time of change that is coming and it can be defined or described as a division of time now when you look at this my brother and sister Webster says it's a period of time or a division of time and then it also describes that there's four marked Seasons now we could take that as spring summer fall winter Etc my brother and sister but I want to tell you there's four Mark seasons in the Believers there's uh these Seasons that God has come and our lives have been marked by divisions of time and I believe that you can sit back and go into your own life and look and and see these very divisions of time that is has brought you to where you are today and it is not by accident that God has typed the natural and the spiritual together but it was his way of expressing himself in nature that we could look out and see a confirmation that's already in our hearts by the revelation of the spirit of God in us and we can look out in nature and see this connection and realize just how fine-tuned all of creation is amen that there is a time that it is marked in sin there's a time that it's marked in Redemption there's a time in this Redemption period that brings restoration and then restoration brings a whole new creation and so it's there that we recognize by God's grace and mercy that we are uh uh uh changing in a season we are changing as it is and these uh times in our life that are marked by these divisions of time we could look at that today now my brother and sister we would never hold a child child a baby H uh we'll just start with a baby we'll never hold a baby to the accountability that we will hold someone else that is older and so babies are there completely dependent and uh uh we can laugh and we can avoid and whatever but my brother and sister when you see the cycle of life that we come from being completely dependent in the natural to completely dependent in the natural we'll realize we are facing the full cycle or full time of this seasons and so God takes us from a baby to a child and you know if if you're a grandparent it can be very uh entertaining uh maybe not so to the parents you know the antics of children but it is there that uh we should stop and enjoy the time because it is fleeting it goes quickly and there is a a innocence in children that they will speak things that we as adults would tend to avoid you know like your parents uh would come and and uh we we would change our conversation in the presence of our parents because their view of the conversation might not be the same as ours and children will come in our presence and they will say the things that we would not be so comfortable to say and you know nothing like sitting somewhere and uh in a restaurant actually is where this example comes from and uh you're sitting there and there's kind of an awkward silence at the table next to you and a little boy walks around the table to the end where his mom and Dad is sitting and looks up at them and it's like Mom and Dad honey honey just sit down no I I need to ask you a question what's your question why are you guys so mad at each other shut up kid and sit down now but you see the Innocents they don't see it like we see it so as we come you know Jesus said lest you be like a little child I don't know how are you guys got your armor on this morning you know we can put whatever title to things in our life that we want to put it in but the Holy Spirit comes and just tells it like it is like a child and we can justify ourselves but unless it's Justified under the blood of Jesus Christ it's not justified and we can hide our sugarcoat now I'm not speaking to you I'm speaking to people that attend a church in this city like you and we can sugarcoat all of these things any way that we please but until we can come with the innocence of a child and be able to look in the mirror at our own lives and look at one another in the in the innocence of this and would come to this division of of time and you say why do you use that example example Because by the time that child is 30 he's also covering he's also trying to sugarcoat it a different season a different time a different place we can say well children you don't understand but maybe in their innocence they understand more than we give them credit for and so this comes to a teen and you got to love teens because they're still holding a certain segment of Innocence but starting to figure out it's it's about the wording can I hear a young person say Amen it's all about the wording who took the cookie mom somebody took a cookie mom already knows that and usually it tells on you by your wording what are we listening to for music well I'm not listening to and you name off the whole list that tells on you otherwise you wouldn't know them so we see that the teen years are a transition from innocence into you might say early stages of iniquity reminds me of a story of a child once his parents told him you not put your hand in that cookie jar and he wanted a cookie so bad he's like how do I get a cookie without putting my hand hand in the cookie jar so he climbed up on the counter pushed the cookie jar off the counter it broke on the floor and he thought I'm doing exactly what my parents said I did not put my hand in the cookie jar almost sounds like a self-made justification are you following me this morning I was justified to do what I did early adulthood brings us into responsibility we talked about it in young adults a little bit this morning you know uh coming to a time I I I threw sister Rachel under the bus on that so I just want I say that so you guys will know that that I'm an equal opportunity abuser sister Rachel is just a visitor but we call her family so I I figured that's fair game but you know there's a time that we go from the innocence of our youth and suddenly you want to have a car you want to have some money to spend you want to do this you want to do that you know um Mom and Dad can you no get a job now the job might be just cleaning the house mowing the lawn it doesn't necessarily you have to be there but ultimately leads to a place that you have to go and deal with this and and I'm just going to be really blunt this morning our sister Gabriella you know entered into the work world she shared testimony and prayer requests here of working with people who are abusive that's things you have to go out in this world and deal with these things but yet God's got a training ground it's bringing us not just to to cause us to uh uh suffer under these things but it's a lesson that we realize that Satan is abusive he he is there and that's why the spirit of abuse should never come into a Pulpit by word or deed because we are not of the devil but we are of God and everything should be for the edification of the word of God in the lives of Sons and Daughters of God and we move in this time of early adulthood and it's still a Time of transition and late adulthood late adulthood is maybe you might say that the stage of life that brother Paul sister Jerry are in right now or Brother David uh brother Trevor sister Carrie whatever uh sister Sue we coming and and that is a years that you use wisdom and you can see that I learned a lesson back here at this time and God allowed me to see this and God's moved in this and and they can be very good years or they can be statistically speaking some of the worst years of people's lives because they ask young people finishing High School entering College what do you want your life to be and they share that and statistically only a small fraction will actually live out what they thought their life would be now you say where you going brother Paul I'm telling you right now my brother and sister God has allowed you to speak what your future will be and he's given you power by the word for that to come to pass we do not have to be Christians for 20 30 40 years and at the end of 20 30 40 Years be unhappy uh uh just feeling abandoned feeling like we've never accomplished but by the grace of God we can actually step into the vision step into the promise of God and we can declare I want to be an overcomer and we will be Overcomers I want to be the word made manifest and you can step into that and be the word made manifest or we can allow the flesh to control us and bring us to a place that I want this and I want that I want to live like the world I want to name the name of Christ but live here and there's where you'll be in 40 years am I speaking too hard this morning you see my brother and sister these things of life I shared it with you last Wednesday we come to these points of life we should have this settled we should not be 50 60 70 year old people still wondering if we're the bride of Christ in fact I'd like to lower that standard if I might we shouldn't even hardly make it out of our teens without having this settled in our life I know who I am I'm a Son of God but the devil he likes us to Kick the Can you know the phrase Kick the Can just keep kicking the can I don't want to deal with it today I kick the can I'll deal with it tomorrow that's not a way to get ahead natural or spiritual amen so if we don't have it settled late adulthood can be just as Troublesome as teens looking to satisfi looking to find an answer looking to find peace my brother and sister I know I'm cutting through lot real quick here but I tell you by the time we get to that point in our life we better have this we should have this settled of who we are amen and wait there's only two positions on the playing field for God or against him it comes down that simple it's man called denomination that add all the subcategories to this a Prophet come in this sour and said strip all of that away you're either for God or you're against him no wonder denomination didn't like him he was telling them Believers tear off the tinsil I'm just going to say this you notice brother Paul didn't preach one sermon about Christmas trees that's your issue that's right not my issue so I guess I did preach about Christmas trees didn't I tear the tinsel off everything we add on to it to make it look better than it really is have you guys ever read sister Rebecca this is a deviation have you ever read sister Rebecca's account you know they were always people always asking sister Rebecca what about Christmas trees and so she wrote this little deal and it was the last Christmas that they were going to be uh before it was last Christmas before brother Brown's death and um you know um they weren't going to have a Christmas tree because they were traveling brother Brown did it for the children amen weren't going to have a Christmas tree sister Rebecca tells a story about how they come one day and brother brandham has got a Christmas tree only because there weren't any Christmas trees available and they were leaving uh he had bought this little aluminum thing with this little fake leaves on it sister Rebeca said it was the ugliest thing you've ever seen in your life I got to get off that subject CU I said I wouldn't preach about Christmas trees so we come into late adulthood and either it can be a life filled with I wished I wished I wished I should have I should I should have or it can be a time in the life to say Thank you Lord I've been able to serve you these years Lord and I'm anchored in the word and I know who I am and even if future like they say getting old is not for sissies and even I know that maybe in the future it might be difficult but you know what I know who I am and I know where I'm going I'm not laying in a hospital bed crying out as sister Jerry and I sister Jerry was with me dealing with a few years ago a man crying out when I die where am I going but we can settle that amen we can anchor that because you see whether we like it or not we're going to go through these change of the seasons Amen in the natural we're going to go through these change of the seasons and I think it would pay us to be gracious because if the Lord terries we're all coming that's it and then that we come to this final season it's called the elderly and my brother and sister you look at that and the elderly can be that in a sense we can be Elder I hope you you catch my little twist of words we can be elder or we can be elderly that's right I'll tell you to my dying breath if the Lord terries I want to be an elderen I want to be someone somebody can look to as we've looked for years to brother Bob and sister Joanne and look how God is held them my own mother look how God has held them and many in our life look how God has held them what would they be classified as Elder in the body the stabilizing factor I don't want to just go old I want to be a stabilizing factor in the house of God I want to be an example to Sons and Daughters of God our young people not just someone getting old in their presence but I want to give something back to them and a word that they can say and hold to their heart that God is faithful and true amen all the days of our lives and you know there's spiritual divisions we're born in sin only one ever Ste beyond that division we're born in sin then we have what we could term if you go down into the uh dictionary and follow it through then we have a Reconciliation and that reconciliation is repent be baptized and you shall be filled with the Holy Ghost there's our reconciliation right there it's not how much money you give to the church not your attendance I I don't say lightly I thought it was a incredible uh deal I I I caught a you know a little something here a few years ago and it was talking about how uh since she had been baptized uh that this lady this this is in the midwest at a church there in a small town this lady was like 88 89 years old and they gave her an award she had never once missed a service since the day of her baptism I mean that's incredible can any of us even come close but it showed a picture of her and this is where the judgmental part comes in you might be in church every single service for 85 years or something doesn't mean that you're in Christ that's right you going be in church and not be in Christ that's right we have reconciliation what does it do it makes us a new creature in Christ I tell you I'm happy to be a new creature amen I want to even be a more new Creature if that Mak sense I want to I want to be so in Christ my brother and sister that this flesh is no longer part of this equation but the prophet told us this flesh would be with us always so don't get the idea that you're somehow tend into perfection in the flesh that's right but you can come to a place that there's no sin because God said I don't count any of this against you you have no sin you never did it in the first place can someone raise a hand and say thank you Lord that you would view me as though I never sinned I trouble in my own mind in my own Spirit of the things that I have said and done behaviors of the past but God said you never did it in the first place you can walk forward now truly as a new creature in Christ Jesus Lord and you can be the righteousness of God that's right that's quite a change isn't it sir but it's reflective of the seasons of our life now my brother and sister when you look at this going back up here into the scripture that we could see in verse 20 says now then we are ambassadors for Christ amen now an ambassador I think you'll like cuz we have ideas what ambassadors are you know our government sends ambassadors to this country and that country and and wherever but look at this in a spiritual context an ambassador is a campaigner amen I believe we're here today in a spiritual warfare we're campaigners we're winning my brother and sister the world to Christ all that can be one amen and you look at this you are an Envoy yes a representative symbolic serving as a symbol of the one you represent that's right so here we are as ambassadors for Christ we must look like the one we represent is this making sense to you today so you see we cannot look like we belong out there and say we're campaigning for Christ we must be representative we must be in the image of have the same thought word and deed as the one that we are campaigning for the same one that we are a symbol of I want to just ask you plain but straight today what are you a symbol of what does your outer man declare you are a symbol of would someone look at you on the street and say I see you're a Christian I know that's a little straight but that's right sorry I labored this morning as to how to preach this my brother and sister figured out that straight was just the best amen amen I want this man on the outside well the outside don't matter so much brother Paul that's right but the outside's reflective of the inside and are we a representative in the very image of the one we represent that's right I know that's straightforward but let it be straightforward it's preached in love that's right amen so it is I want to look amen I want to be a symbol of Amen that when the world looks at us they see Christ not religious people I watched a lovely documentary a few days ago thought it was very well done it was an interview of a man who had left the LDS church and while he clearly articulated all the things that he saw that was wrong he also articulated what was right Family Values good support blah blah blah all these things but he says what got me is when I started taking what they taught us and took it back to a reference point that's right and realized what I was taught did not even reflect early Mormonism that's right so they had morphed and we say here this morning wow yeah have we morphed let's be careful we don't morph just like they morphed let's be careful that the image we're presenting is the image that's in scripture that's right amen not the image that we think it should be that's right amen remember what the prophet said when you I'm just Loosely paraphrasing this when the mayor of the city starts attending your church watch out I don't think we have to worry about it I don't think the mayor will stay around very long if they do attend church my brother and sister but we're not here to be judgmental we're here to be the word amen and you know I'll get to this in just a second but the word is actually in reality not judgmental now judgment begins in the house of God but we have to look at this in the right perspective my brother and sister and look in 1 Thessalonians the 5th chapter: 1-9 but of the times and the seasons Brethren you have no need that I write unto you for yourselves know perfectly that the day of the Lord so cometh as a thief in the night for when they shall say peace and safety which is what is happening even right now we've seen it through the years but it's right now they're saying we got to stop this we got to stop that we need peace and In the Flesh we would all agree then sudden destruction cometh upon them as to Veil upon a woman with child they shall not Escape but ye Brethren are not in darkness can we say Amen to that that the day should overtake you as a thief right ye are all the children of light and the children of the day and we are not of the night nor of Darkness I love how this just breaks this down this is where this is at but this is where you are at right every day the light Rises Sunrise comes a few seconds earlier than it did yesterday I don't remember what was it a week ago or something the sols time started changing we're coming back into light now I get sidetracked here if I'm not careful but the prophet of God said that same cycle takes place in our life let me put it this way way we're on fire for God and we cool off a little bit we're on fire for God and we cool off a little bit when you cool off does that mean you're lost no sir no sir it's a season that's right something taking place in your life sometimes God uses Seasons amen you never appreciate spring until you've went through winter you never appreciate Florida till you've lived in Idaho that was brother Stan he's like you know brother Paul you you and sister Jerry could just come down here where it's warm you know how hard pierced me right in my heart it's like stand please but we're not of Darkness that the day should overtake you but your children of light Children of the day were not of the night nor of Darkness therefore let us not sleep as do others but let us watch and be sober for they that sleep sleep in the night and they that are drunken are drunken in the night but let us can we identify with that who are of the day be sober putting on the breastplate of faith and love and for a helmet the hope of salvation for God hath not appointed us to wrath but to obtain salvation by our Lord Jesus Christ I love that scripture my brother and sister because it clearly gives us a warning that the devil is is out here he's outside you might say the gates of the the city and it's in the time of Darkness that usually those Spirits move but the light has come to us and we now recognize it doesn't make us immune but we now recognize the Ws of the enemy we recognize how Satan would come in a certain time just like you might have a great church service and the Devil comes right along behind that and wants to steal that away from you that was God's gift to you so the devil's trying to steal a gift from God to you I'm not going to give the devil I don't want to give the devil but sometimes my flesh how is that that brother jul do that wowy wowy woo woe unto me wowy wowy woo don't look at me with those blank faces come on we might even put that to music wowy wowy woo wowy wowy woo the devil got to me and he's going to get to you no no no no no no no no victory is mine victory is mine Victory today not kicking the can Victory next month is mine Victory next month is mine and we get to next month Victory next year is mine come on Victory Is Ours Hallelujah the word of God today is producing exactly what the word said it would very simplistic statement isn't it so where does The Fault lie if we're not seeing it produced is it in the word you'll find that many of these critics sorry to even bring a critic's name not name but the name critic many of these critics my brother and sister that are so harsh against the message you know what really you get get them to admit this you got to root for a long time they actually feel like the word of God failed them the message failed them but if the scripture says there's nothing new Under the Sun if it failed them then it's failed 6,000 years of Believers can you believe that I don't have enough Faith No that's right to believe that God's word has failed for 6,000 years so the truth of it is they failed and they want to pass the blame to someone else I'll make a bold statement today and I hope it doesn't offend anybody but if you're feeling like today you can't live it you're listening to the wrong voice amen this word is an overcoming word this word is a powerful word this word has never failed and can never fail because you know what the minute this word fails the creative power that spoke Heaven into Earth into existence will have to fail with it and in a blink of an eye this world will go dark and throw itself right out of orbit and we go into total darkness because God can't stand faithful on one thing and fail at another he either is in control or he is not in control and I'm here today to say he's in control and I want to give him control of my life I don't want my wife going into darkness and spiraling out of control CU you see it wouldn't be God's fault it'll be our fault that's right you see we get to choose our image of representation well look at us today are you guys okay with Paul being Paul today look at us today we're going to pass a new ordinance in the church yall Brothers have to dress like me next Sunday they'll only be me here because you're not me right did you follow me the word let you be you while fulfilling the word amen come on my brother and sister amen let's face a simple reality the word let you be you so it's not about how the word deals with you it is how you deal with the word because God calls you you have to respond you have to say yes amen and if you don't say yes then you can't blame the word because the word called now let's look at this real quick I need to just keep moving along here let's just go right into let's go right into the hour has come amen now I want you to notice that it's the same holy spirit that was in the days of the Apostles are here or is here now present tense in this meeting working among the people now it behooves us to realize this that it wasn't your brother I brother Brown I'm talking about himself it wasn't me it is your lord Jesus who is here and we're all representative of his now we know that's the truth do you believe that's true now his holy spirit is here and he's just as willing and he can work through the people as the people will let him work do you believe that and I'm going to say amen I believe that now there was many things that Jesus himself could not do because of unbelief is that right many things he could not do we hate to think that they could not do it because of their unbelief so I use this quote my brother and sister toly articulate you that he is willing he's here this morning more than willing are we willing to respond are we willing to let the word make a change in us are we willing to recognize there's a change in the season of our lives but change from us maybe being able to say well I'm a message believer I think God sent a prophet to being a message believer that Jesus Christ has spoken to me personally CU if he hasn't spoken personally then you have secondhand religion that's right and I can't find anywhere where secondhand religion works like firsthand religion you see what this season is Revelations 19 this is a season of Lamb's wife making herself ready and there is a great multitude that is shouting hallelujah amen I tell you my brother and sister every victory that I see not cuz I'm a pastor but every Victory I see see take place in Great's Tabernacle my heart sings to the heavens I am so excited when I see little victories amen little things that come in our life we recognize the devil's no longer got a hold of that God's got a hold of it but I had to take my hands off of it for God to take a hold of it but instead we're too busy wrestling it from the hands of the devil it's not your job to wrestle it from the hands of the devil it's your job to take your hands off of it and let God take care of it and when we take our hands off of it and let God take care of it it's amazing what happens around us amazing I remember one time dealing with a family you know it was quite interesting sister had actually hadn't been to church for six or eight months Pastor I go to church service after service and God doesn't do anything I don't see God doing anything pretty stunning isn't it you believe God asked you to participate Here Comes Paul oblivious to everything studying got kind of a crazy off-the-wall type of a thought but I was like well Lord if I just can't get over this thought I can't I can't seem to move on I go to church her and her husband children are there and I was animated enough that probably you Saints here in Grace Tabernacle would be like Brother Paul's on speed I was flailing my arms and I was up and you know I mean Hallelujah you know I've done it before but I I I'm there and I just their church is way bigger than this and I end up in the very back of the church and and you know God is so Supernatural my brother and sister that he knows how to guide our footsteps and I end up stopping right behind a Pew and giving this crazy analogy if you want to see me you're going to have to look for me because if you're looking forward like you was a minute ago you won't see me amen but maybe sometimes you got to turn your neck you got to put some effort in looking for God you got to say God your word says you're here where are you where are you and I'm standing as it turns out right behind this sister that I know not what wi of what her issue or her struggle is and it's there that God comes down Holy Spirit speaks to her and said I've been expecting God to walk up in front of me and say I am God I am here but she had to put the effort in to say Lord your word said your word said your word said that you're here and I'm going to find you inside this building today because you said you would be here amen or we can cross our arms and say I look in the mountains and I look in the seas and I look in the lakes and the rivers and I looked here and I looked there and I didn't see God what was you looking for I tell you what I'm looking for the promise amen his promise has to be faithful it has to be true or we have nothing in fact you won't have light Earth matter trees water fish you'll have nothing if God's word isn't true that's it it'll all be gone amen because you see the minute you puncture the vacuum it collapses but if everything is built from Christ you can't puncture it that's right no amount of unbelief no amount of fear anxieties doubts no matter what the devil might offer you can't puncture that so it's going to come down to it's up to you that's right it's up to you whether you're going to let the word of God be manifest and I say Lord manifest your word in me let me be a representative today Lord that people might actually say I think that man is different we could get into some senseless nonsense of examples it's not actually senseless it's true but we don't need to make the point this is a season of the Lamb's wife amen this is a season to be [Music] certain now okay let me finish that quote I got sidetracked is that okay to get sidetracked sometimes there's many things Jesus himself couldn't do because of unbelief people have a hard time believing that but it's the truth now look at this now the right mental attitude we know this quote amen all you along here do you understand what I mean when I say the right mental attitude that's your right mental attitude toward God's Divine promise will bring any promise to pass oh let me finish a story somebody the other day mentioned said brother Paul never finishes his stories they didn't tell it to me they told someone else who told it to me that sister sitting in the service that day right there light bulb turns on you kind of feel bad when you're preaching I don't know brother Chris Brother David do you ever feel bad when you're preaching and somebody bursts into tears starts sobbing I don't know it kind of bothers me I'm like did I say something wrong but this sister sitting right there starts crying puts her head down and I'm like okay maybe I'll move over to this side of the aisle broke a spirit right there she went to her husband to her children repented went well went to God first repented went to husband children repented went to the pastor repented and that evening they invited us to a house sister Jerry's there and they invited that and the sister pours out and my brother and sister you would look today I hope you don't feel offended to this you would look today at the things that caused her to start doing what she was doing and thinking like she was thinking and you'd say what what that got you out of the house of God that got you where you would Harley Harley wouldn't take care of your husband and your CH what but when we face it ourself it's this huge mountain it's a mohill in everybody else's life but it's a mountain in ours God came in there broke that spirit amen I'll tell you what I sat there as they're sharing their story I'm just like oh wow I said that you said in the service brother Paul da da da da I said that okay you see it's not man speaking it's God speaking let's let God speak this morning Saints let him deal with your heart be tender and let God deal with you don't think about the crazy old guy up front that's speaking it's God speaking to you it's the word coming forth it's life changing it's changing with the seasons of Our Lives now we look at this and he says the right mental attitude that's your right mental attitude towards God's Divine promise will bring in any promise to pass maybe you don't believe that you say well my faith is weak I wouldn't confess it see don't let the devil know that always say I got good faith I mean I would almost want to ask you I will ask you could you lift a hand and say I've got good faith amen I might be struggling in my life but I'm going to say I believe God I believe he's real that's right don't testify nothing of the devil that's right you know I'll tell you I got to be careful here I've caused some of our little kids to sing some things that got them in trouble with their parents and the parents got me in trouble but I'm telling you my brother and sister look how easy it is that the devil Works he comes and anoints the music that anoints the spirit and the spirit has people confessing they're lost they're Wicked they're full of whatever and they don't even real driving down the road you know I felt like a real fool with my Corvette thing the other day so I'm going to resist the example but I'm telling you you'll see it they're driving down the road barely look over the car door which means they have sawed the bottom of their car seat off and I won't even repeat the words are coming out of the car because they're so filthy and so vile and they're right there singing along and if we're not careful we'll be let's see it can't be a man's store it needs to be a women's store we'll be in Macy's no that's not fair is it does Macy's have a hardware section not that I remember anyway and that same music without words but music will be coming through the speaker well it didn't have any words it had you know I felt myself huh they don't need words it's got its own language amen the devil's got his own language and he speaks it fluently and he's got people speaking it for him that's my point people speak it for him right well if they anointed of Darkness can speak it how can we as Sons and Daughters of God be speaking that language we can't speak his language I can't understand his language I know nothing of his language what I know is the word of God and the spirit of God and the power of the word coming forth let that be what our lips are amen not to say my faith is weak whether you feel like you're defeated or not I have faith amen amen that's right amen take him at his word then it's all over see I like this I spoke this one time and a brother kind of got upset with me because he felt like I was blaming God for something but look what the prophet of God says here let me go back far enough and when you accept him as your healer don't never act like you're sick or crippled anymore believe that you're healed take him at his word then it's all over on God then and not on you amen I can't bring myself into healing have faith for your healing brother and sister I prayed for so many people through the years have faith for your healing oh my brother and sister maybe we better start trust God he's already spoke the word it's already a finished word just trust him you're Faith won't heal you only your faith as it is Christ in you will heal you just trust him you said it Lord I believe it today I believe that I'm a Son of God I believe I'm a daughter of God maybe my music ain't right maybe my clothes ain't right maybe my attitude ain't right but I believe that you're God and I believe in God let that change your life Hallelujah excuse me from getting excited but when you bottle this up over time my brother and sisters just got to get out amen then the word as long that's over on God then and not on you see you as long as you take God at his word then the word will produce what it promised to do amen is that right now have faith believe him all your heart you see we don't just throw Faith out but your faith my brother and sister must have something activated amen Amen brother Chris and I here and there we keep bouncing across this little sub line Catalyst what is a catalyst for healing prophet of God last Wednesday we read the quote he said you just believe trust he'll lead you imagine what's the word lead mean amen what's the word mean not us bouncing into this bouncing into that but it would be he takes us by the hand figurative and says here here's your healing here's your deliverance here's Victory amen come over here right and he starts guiding us that's right and he comes around this Pitfall and takes us around this Pitfall and he leads us into Deliverance into Victory amen into the revelation of the word not what I've done but what he has done for me let me hurry along time is so fleeting amen somebody sitting right where you're at just pray Lord help brother Paul amen Believers position in Christ we'll just bounce through this one real quick so brother Brown's talking there you can read it as I talk amen Moses lost all his hope amen kind of lost all his power he kind of come to the place you know what uh sitting there uh I guess freedom is n for the children of Israel but there was something in his heart he just couldn't get around that right and so he lost the thought of Freedom till God meets him one day right isn't it amazing God's ways are so much different than our ways if we were planning the Deliverance of Israel we would have been secretly building swords and Spears and shields in our houses a little secret underground industry as it would be and we're going to you know know right where all the horses and all the Chariots are and we're going to know how to block the streets off to keep them from doing yeah but that's not God's way right that's not God's way Moses had to have a change of thinking amen he had to have a change of approach and God lets Moses come on we're always like well God's perfect will God's permissible will my brother and sister God let Moses go out and kill one of them men because he was going to prove to Moses that won't work amen and we talk about I hope I'm not too outlined here we talk about we have to kill this flesh we've got to die out you know I use this irreverent example the other day most of us if truth of reality hit us and God placed us right where our understanding was would find out we were in some Buddhist Monastery somewhere because if I can just punish myself enough if I can just beat myself down far enough if I can just do this and I can just do that I I'll just pray I'll just do this I'll prayer we should be praying but I'm telling you if you think you got to pray till you can't you know your legs are numb and your brain is numb and your elbows are numb and that's going to make a difference you're a Buddhist monk but the prophet shows us that when we come to that place to be in God's perfect will is when we can literally completely absolutely trust him amen and when you trust him if he leads you to pray till your legs are numb that's what you do that's right if he leads you over here literally through busy life be driving down the freeway and pray unceasingly you know that's that's with both eyes open I don't recommend you pray with your eyes closed on the freeway you see there's a lot of aspects we look at it in such a way but you can say well I prayed all day long as I was driving you still need to stop in 100% complete focus and say Lord I'm here before you humbling myself to you you see seems like a paradox doesn't it pray without ceasing well I got to do this I can't pray while I'm on the job yes you can yes you can but mostly you need to pray through till you can completely trust God lord we're here tell me right tell me left tell me stop tell me go tell me to make a phone call tell me sometimes the Simplicity of God speaking to us is the friction that's between us is you taking accountability for the friction that's between you and someone else amen and say Lord forgive me for the issue I have with them amen and you start praying amen I won't go into I probably shouldn't even bring it up but brother Isaac and I was talking about a little something here the other day and we both stopped in this little situation and said what we need to do is pray together and agree together about this situation changing brother Isaac would be a witness if you needed to look back there I'm sure he would lift his hand my brother and sister we saw within days that situation absolutely changed not because you go and tell someone they're wrong and tell someone they're right but you take that Before the Throne of almighty God and say Lord we submit this to you and whatever result it is Lord we trust you amen hallelujah amen see Moses forgot about Freedom he forgot God's promise that he'd free them God hadn't forgot his promise that's usually about the way it is my brother and sister we we have forgotten but God has not and he says Moses tried in himself and failed and that's what the church has done many times we tried in ourselves to do things and we failed to find God's element of time it um God's got a time for all things he's got a time that he has we plant corn maybe this is why this quote just struck me so much we plant corn uh we got a time we plow corn then at the time we harvest corn and the spring rains come and the drought through the summer Then Fall rains and the Snows you can't just say I plant my wheat today and tomorrow go out and harvest it and I think sometimes when we talk about having faith we think because we got down and said Lord I believe you're going to do this I believe you're going to do that we get up expecting to happen tomorrow and it may God very well can come on the scene can you say Amen to that we've seen God do that answer prayer right now but what if God wants you to wait through the cold of the winter and in the springtime when it starts to warm up you only see a sprig or two of green in the field and your heart starts to say oh my I think we have crop failure where's your faith then but in August as the combine rolls through the field and see the golden wheat pouring out of the combine into the truck you're reminded every seed brings forth of its own kind and we're not the seed of drought no we are not the seed of the scorching summer heat of Leo deia we are the seed of Jesus Christ hallelujah amen oh let me just go on let me bounce over this saint you you can look back if you want the quotes there this is something I really want to touch on see we can look at the word now I wouldn't ask for a hand or anything but we can look at the word now the scripture tells us that judgement begins in the house of God and we say Amen to that but we can look at the word as though it's judgment to you we look at that we look at the word as though it's judgment to us but do give me a moment if you would and we'll bounce back up into this quote and come and maybe give you a slightly different point of view amen you see we go in this and God has times Seasons times the presence of the Lord wasn't there to heal the sick okay let's go back up a little farther and the presence of the Lord was there to heal the sick and that's when Jesus was ministering to and in the presence of the Lord there was to heal the sick maybe at other times the presence of the Lord wasn't there right to heal the sick will you still have faith if he passes You by that's right think of the example at the pool of Bethesda how many Jesus walked by that's right I heard it preached one time see they were all the unbelievers I don't believe that they were not the all unbelievers my brother and sister or else every time a healing took place in this assembly or anywhere in the body of Believers we'd have to say oh there must be something wrong wrong with us but that's not the way God operates amen so the presence of the Lord wasn't there to heal the sick and we find out that God works everything seasonally and now in Moses when he failed to find was a time limit of God that when God revealed himself to him in the burning bush he found out then that the very thing that was in The Burning Bush was the thing that he lacked amen that's right now let me go into my thought my brother and sister you can toss it out if you want but I tell you my brother and sisters sometimes we look at this and we're thinking oh oh the word is so hard the word is so hard the the pastor was looking at me the preacher the minister brother Chris Brother David was looking at me when they said that statement that's just so harsh well maybe it's just a burning bush not bringing judgment to you right bringing what's lacking that's right amen that's right sir go ahead find a bicycle eat The Petal off of it come on probably not too many of us here need sulfur like that but if you looked out my who can I pick on I'll pick on my own grandchildren amen Ali and Ellie you guys are brother Paul Leah and Ellie are in the back parking lot of the church chewing the pedal off the bicycle what are they like him young people people forgive me but I'm going to speak it this straight you're out here dabbling in the things of the world that's it is that your bicycle pedal you're trying to find what's lacking in your life you know I feel totally qualified to preach about this because I chewed the pedal off of a few bicycles in my days this will satisfy that'll satisfy this will that will but then one day it's sad to say I had to be in my 30s to figure this out and I trust you young people don't wait till you're in your 30s to figure this out one day I figured out the very thing that I lacked I needed so desperately had been right in front of me the whole time I went out here and I had this and I went over here and I had that and I don't want to get into that we don't want to glorify those things but I'll just put it this way I chewed the pedal off of a lot of bicycles and not one drop of that changed my life right but one day yes sir I recognized what I was really lacking was a relationship with Jesus Christ that was the only thing that was going to make me happy amen amen I got worldly friends and I'm I'm just cruel to them I just am literally cruel to them some of you might be appalled at how cruel I am to them because I just asked them they would like make some comment wow we had a wild weekend right and I'm like really so did that case of Bud Light that you drank yeah fixed your marriage got your kids straightened out no your kids are acting like you your wife acts like you and that that pains me because sister Jerry's probably inwardly saying amen right now but it's there my brother and sister you see we're tossing the blame somewhere else it's time for you to receive what's lacking in your life you're not going to find it in Leo deia no sir I need to close sister Ruth if you'll just come to the piano it'll cause me to close and amen see we look at the word as though it's judgment to us but in reality it's just bringing us what we La am and so while we close up over judgment can you say Amen you know I if we if somebody comes and judges us you know I don't know Sister Carrie and sister Sue are fair game here they're both wearing black leather boots and you know I don't like black leather boots and I find a way to condemn black leather boots and and um sister Sarah's shaking her head like that's nonsense brother Paul that's right it's nonsense maybe we were talking about black leather boots with 6inch heels but we just choose black leather boots we just choose this random we choose that random and people are like wait I he's judging me isn't that the favorite Mantra of the world today don't judge me well you get to judge you or God will judge you why don't we sometimes realize that God's word coming to us is not judgment it's actually trying to fill a void of what we lack in our life now sound harsh the shoe fits where it if you're going to the movies you're drinking you're dancing you're doing this you're doing that acting misbehaving blah blah blah if you do just wear it own it but it's not me judging you and it's not even really God judging you because there's going to be a judgment later God's showing you this is what's lacking that's right this is what's lacking you guys ought to see pray for me some health issues when it's all done the doctor says well your body's lacking this your body's lacking that the body's lacking this the body's lacking that you need to take this you need to take that and I leaped over the desk I grabbed the doctor by the front of his shirt and I start shaking him and telling me you're a liar you don't believe me do you no sir we stop and say how do I fix it how do I fix it read read your Bible that's it pray amen get in the word amen eat the book that's right everything you need is in the book start eating the book and as you eat the book suddenly you start to feel a little bit better and suddenly things around you all change it's a new season
