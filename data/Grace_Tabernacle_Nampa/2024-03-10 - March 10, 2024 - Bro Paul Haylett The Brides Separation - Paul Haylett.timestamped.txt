[51:28] song I have to
[51:32] sing you a
[51:37] lovely in his
[51:43] time isn't it beautiful that we
[51:46] can and will come to that place in our
[51:49] life where we're completely
[51:52] submitted to the Lord's will and can
[51:54] just say Lord Lord You Lead all follow
[51:58] you know that's when we realize that we
[52:02] actually have become one with him at
[52:05] that point when we're in a complete
[52:07] surrender that we can trust everything
[52:10] about our own
[52:12] life to be
[52:15] guided by him
[52:17] amen it's good to be here today and I
[52:21] certainly appreciate the words that
[52:23] brother Isaac spoke
[52:26] sister Joanne's celebration of life uh
[52:30] was just a lovely time a lovely
[52:32] atmosphere and you know I I hope this
[52:36] doesn't sound awkward but I want you to
[52:39] understand that funeral homes are just
[52:42] like any other public place there's all
[52:44] kinds of spirits and all kinds of things
[52:47] there and for there to be such a lovely
[52:49] Spirit
[52:51] there you brought it you're the reason
[52:55] Reon there was a lovely Spirit there and
[52:58] I say thank you to each and everyone
[53:00] who's able to be there uh because it's
[53:03] there that sometimes we have ideas when
[53:06] we testify we're called to testify of
[53:09] the Life of Christ sometimes we envision
[53:12] I believe most of the time we envision
[53:14] us standing somewhere on a corner or in
[53:17] a store and witnessing this but we've
[53:20] been called that our very life day by
[53:23] day would be that Witness
[53:25] you're
[53:26] different you're not the same as this
[53:29] world and God uses you to testify in
[53:33] those circumstances and oh the devil
[53:36] doesn't like that he'll come and he'll
[53:39] do everything he can do to change that
[53:41] but the word has been spoken do we
[53:44] believe that the word has been spoken it
[53:48] must come to pass amen so let's quit
[53:51] laboring to bring it to pass and just
[53:54] let it flow through us that our life
[53:56] would be the word being manifested amen
[54:00] I want to speak to you this morning on
[54:04] the bride
[54:05] separation and uh as we look at this I
[54:08] appreciate you musicians and uh brother
[54:11] Isaac and song Service uh it's just good
[54:15] I I feel blessed amen that God is just
[54:18] moving on our our young people and uh
[54:23] you notice Sister Sarah included you and
[54:26] the young people um that it's just good
[54:30] God is gracious let's turn in
[54:32] Revelations 18 and4 very very simple
[54:36] scripture that I want to build from this
[54:38] morning in this uh uh when we look at
[54:43] this scripture uh and take it in its
[54:47] expanded form now brother Chris the
[54:50] other day was sharing something out of
[54:52] the Amplified and it struck me as I read
[54:55] it out of the Amplified that um you know
[54:59] sometimes uh we just look at something
[55:03] maybe almost too
[55:04] narrow I used to think we don't need
[55:07] anything but the King James but
[55:09] sometimes you know when our Horizon our
[55:13] view is expanded just a little bit wider
[55:16] and it gets put right back into our
[55:19] language and in that particular uh case
[55:22] it it was quite interesting their choice
[55:24] of work words and their choice of words
[55:27] actually would really fit our life each
[55:29] day and so you know sometimes I think
[55:32] you know I just want to take Revelations
[55:34] 18:4 and uh just watch it be
[55:39] expanded
[55:41] Amplified in our lives amen let it let
[55:45] it not just be a scripture but let it be
[55:48] Amplified amen and I heard another voice
[55:52] from Heaven
[55:53] saying come out of her my people that
[55:58] you be not partakers of her sins and
[56:01] that you receive not of her plagues
[56:04] Heavenly Father we thank you for the
[56:06] word today just ask Lord for your uh
[56:09] guiding hand that we would be able to
[56:11] just speak of these things Lord for the
[56:13] benefit of this body of Believers be
[56:16] with each and every one father those of
[56:18] the body who are not here this morning
[56:20] for whatever reason Lord we just send
[56:23] your Holy Spirit out Lord for healing
[56:25] touches father for those maybe at work
[56:28] today uh uh our sister April father uh
[56:32] Lord any other circumstance be may your
[56:35] Holy Spirit Reach Out And Touch each
[56:37] life we ask father for your guidance oh
[56:41] Father how we want out of this world
[56:44] father but Lord we're not going to leave
[56:48] this world fleeing this world but we're
[56:51] going to leave this world as conquerors
[56:54] of this world
[56:55] father lead us and guide us that we may
[56:58] be conquerors in our life as the word
[57:01] has declared we ask this in the name of
[57:03] Jesus Christ amen amen you may be
[57:08] seated as we look at this I just want to
[57:11] take just one moment um to share our
[57:15] last weekend with you uh we had a lovely
[57:19] time with uh brother Chris and sister
[57:22] Brenda Moritz uh they hosted us there at
[57:25] their place and uh treated us so so well
[57:29] and uh we really appreciate that uh uh
[57:32] the church Living Word had hosted a
[57:35] couple's banquet and uh while we're
[57:39] working on our reper I think that's the
[57:41] right word of of things that we're doing
[57:44] here at Grace I I don't know maybe a a
[57:47] couple's banquet might be an order amen
[57:50] uh we want to do it maybe Living Word
[57:52] style not not too fussy not too too
[57:55] formal uh if you had been there you
[57:57] would have said this is wonderful it was
[57:59] just a good time and uh while we kind of
[58:03] uh uh uh I don't know I'm glad it wasn't
[58:06] recorded that's what I'll say I'm just
[58:09] glad it wasn't recorded uh but a lovely
[58:12] time with the Saints there to see them
[58:15] enjoying their time together and uh many
[58:18] of those couples uh have quite a history
[58:23] uh you know their testimony and how God
[58:25] brought them out and to see their lives
[58:28] just as we saw brother Bob sister Joanne
[58:31] All These Years of Living this message
[58:35] uh we have others that that are a
[58:38] testimony in another location of the
[58:40] very same power of God how God come and
[58:44] moved and then to see such a a abundance
[58:47] of young couples uh raising their
[58:50] families in the fear and admonition of
[58:51] the Lord it was just a wonderful time
[58:55] and uh so we had a good time on Sunday
[58:59] with them I just uh tried to speak
[59:01] something that might have been
[59:02] encouraging to them and uh it was good
[59:06] and thank you for your prayers and uh
[59:09] the church there sends their greetings
[59:11] to each and every one of you Amen to be
[59:15] a called out
[59:16] people uh my brother and sister is not
[59:20] us to be a people that is hiding
[59:22] somewhere separated by a physical
[59:25] barrier but to be a people actually
[59:28] called to live in plain sight and when
[59:31] you think about the revelation of that
[59:34] to be called to live this Gospel of
[59:37] Jesus Christ in plain sight that means
[59:40] you are exposed to every Spirit every
[59:43] attribute every criticism every bit of
[59:46] support but it's there that God has come
[59:49] and you know in days of old you know
[59:52] they they went and hid themselves in the
[59:55] mountains and the caves and and uh it
[59:58] was there but God has called us to be
[1:00:01] hidden vessels for him in plain sight we
[1:00:05] were called to have our life be put on
[1:00:09] display and um you know the barrier that
[1:00:12] we rely on today I I think that my
[1:00:15] brother and sister uh the word has
[1:00:18] declared to us that this would be the
[1:00:20] darkest day this would be one of the
[1:00:22] most evil days and C certainly we see
[1:00:25] all around if you just glimpse into the
[1:00:28] news just remotely you'll see that there
[1:00:31] is all kinds of things taking place
[1:00:33] today that just are are just so
[1:00:37] incredibly uh uh horrible that there's
[1:00:40] all kinds of just random acts of
[1:00:43] violence against humanity there's hate
[1:00:46] there's fear all of this there but we do
[1:00:49] not need to live a life of fear we need
[1:00:52] to live a life of the over Comer with
[1:00:55] joy in our heart because you are
[1:00:56] protected by the barrier of the Holy
[1:00:59] Ghost amen the holy ghost in your life
[1:01:02] has become the very protection that we
[1:01:05] seek now my brother and sisters
[1:01:07] certainly There Are Places on the earth
[1:01:10] that we don't want to go to we don't
[1:01:12] want to visit those places you will not
[1:01:15] find me roaming the alleys of our big
[1:01:17] cities and maybe even the alleys of
[1:01:20] Boise Idaho uh at night it just is not a
[1:01:24] good idea I remember a few years ago
[1:01:28] that um you know uh brother Gideon took
[1:01:30] sister Jerry and I to this streets of
[1:01:33] suo which is where Nelson Mandela come
[1:01:36] from we toured his house and we got a
[1:01:39] lot of looks some looks were of
[1:01:41] curiosity and some were of malice but my
[1:01:44] brother and sister today you would not
[1:01:46] dare walk the streets of suo if you are
[1:01:50] of of a different uh uh uh uh race race
[1:01:55] color Etc it's a place of violence now
[1:01:58] and it's not even violence see this is
[1:02:00] where sometimes everybody wants to focus
[1:02:02] it on racism but this is just simply
[1:02:06] violence on Humanity they don't care
[1:02:09] it's the spirit it's bubbling up the
[1:02:11] streets of Los Angeles Chicago New York
[1:02:15] all of these places there's places in
[1:02:17] Miami Florida that the police do not go
[1:02:21] at night and so we look at this and see
[1:02:23] what is coming coming to pass and this
[1:02:25] is not just in America my brother and
[1:02:28] sister but this is the spirits of the
[1:02:31] age coming forth they're breaking the
[1:02:33] prophet of God talks how these Spirits
[1:02:35] would be breaking forth from the earth
[1:02:38] and then you would see what would come
[1:02:40] to pass and so it's there that we are
[1:02:42] people living in plain sight protected
[1:02:45] by the Holy Ghost amen we are in this
[1:02:48] present world but we are not of this
[1:02:50] present world and we look and and we
[1:02:53] just read thist scripture at uh sister
[1:02:56] Joanne's funeral Romans 8
[1:03:00] 35-39 who shall separate us from the
[1:03:03] love of Christ shall tribulation or
[1:03:06] distress or persecution or famine or
[1:03:09] nakedness or Peril or sword as is
[1:03:12] written for thy sake we are killed all
[1:03:15] the day long we are counted as sheep for
[1:03:18] the slaughter nay in all these things we
[1:03:22] are more than conquered Can someone say
[1:03:25] Amen to that amen how are we conquerors
[1:03:29] through him that loved us so we look so
[1:03:33] much to this human vessel here and we're
[1:03:36] caring for it we're concerned for it we
[1:03:38] do all of this and rightly so but my
[1:03:41] brother and sister this flesh is never
[1:03:44] going to be the Conqueror that we expect
[1:03:46] it to be this flesh will never be as
[1:03:49] perfect as we would long for it to be
[1:03:52] because it was never called to be the
[1:03:54] the perfect vessel the soul of mankind
[1:03:57] the soul that God said I'll come and
[1:03:59] I'll redeem it and I'll seal it oh
[1:04:03] Hallelujah he'll seal it not you and I
[1:04:05] sealing it not some action of this world
[1:04:08] or of the church to seal it but he
[1:04:10] himself by the Holy Spirit would come
[1:04:13] and seal that inner man amen and it's
[1:04:17] that inner man my brother and sister
[1:04:19] that we must look to it is not us as
[1:04:22] conquerors but it's him in US as the
[1:04:25] Conqueror amen for I'm persuaded that
[1:04:28] neither death neither death nor life nor
[1:04:31] angels nor principalities nor powers nor
[1:04:35] things present nor things to come pretty
[1:04:37] well covered your life right amen
[1:04:40] beginning to end nor height nor depth
[1:04:43] nor any other creature shall be able to
[1:04:46] separate us from the love of God which
[1:04:48] is in Christ Jesus our lord now when I
[1:04:51] read this scripture my brother and
[1:04:53] sister because we're old human and we
[1:04:54] have slightly different comprehensions
[1:04:57] the way we look at things but when I
[1:04:59] look at this scripture this is an
[1:05:01] eternal promise this is not a just a
[1:05:04] hope or maybe so but an eternal promise
[1:05:07] that we can hang our lives on we we can
[1:05:10] sit here and say you know what I don't
[1:05:12] care what happens to this old vessel of
[1:05:15] Flesh I don't care what happens in the
[1:05:17] politics of our day our countries or the
[1:05:20] world I have been made and called to be
[1:05:23] a conqueror and it is the word of God
[1:05:26] that is in us that empowers us to live
[1:05:29] day by day I think my brother and sister
[1:05:32] that we could not even hardly live for a
[1:05:34] bit of time a period of time without God
[1:05:37] in us amen the devil doesn't exactly
[1:05:40] like
[1:05:41] you he looked at you and said you know
[1:05:44] what here's something that that they
[1:05:46] have that I don't like I see potential
[1:05:50] in them now the devil never gives up
[1:05:53] right so he's never going to to stop and
[1:05:54] say oh they're the bride of Christ and
[1:05:56] predestination says they'll never fall
[1:05:59] so I'll leave them alone no the the
[1:06:01] Satan is uh an optimist I almost used
[1:06:05] the word eternal optimist but he's not
[1:06:07] Eternal so he can't be an eternal
[1:06:09] optimist but he is an optimist that
[1:06:12] while he looks at your life he sees
[1:06:15] every characteristic or attribute of the
[1:06:17] bride of Christ by the word he doesn't
[1:06:20] care he's going to keep pursuing you
[1:06:22] he's going to keep bother in you and
[1:06:24] when you really should get concerned is
[1:06:26] when he
[1:06:29] quits cuz he's not going to quit until
[1:06:31] he thinks he's got you so when he quits
[1:06:34] bothering your life amen that's when we
[1:06:37] should really get concerned some people
[1:06:40] say well I want to get so close to the
[1:06:42] Lord that the devil can't bother me I
[1:06:44] tell you my brother and sister your soul
[1:06:46] will get close to the Lord but your
[1:06:48] flesh is still flesh and the devil will
[1:06:50] still torment your flesh amen
[1:06:54] and so we have to admit that Satan will
[1:06:57] use any tool he can we have to just stop
[1:07:01] and say yep there's still things this
[1:07:03] flesh is here and Satan will still use
[1:07:06] my imagination he will still use my
[1:07:09] emotion he will still use my intellect
[1:07:12] he will still use different things my
[1:07:14] brother and sister and he'll use that to
[1:07:17] his best ability amen every thought deed
[1:07:21] or action he'll use it against you when
[1:07:23] a police policeman comes and maybe even
[1:07:25] if it's mistaken but they believe you
[1:07:28] might have committed a crime H they tell
[1:07:30] you in natural words that uh everything
[1:07:33] that you say and do can and will be held
[1:07:36] against you in a court of law well you
[1:07:39] know as Sons and Daughters of God I say
[1:07:42] Amen to that amen everything that I can
[1:07:45] say and do will be held against me but
[1:07:48] God said I already judged you by the
[1:07:51] word and I won't judge you again so this
[1:07:54] cannot be held but Satan will be there
[1:07:57] in the court saying but I saw them and I
[1:08:00] heard them and I saw the action and I
[1:08:03] saw this and I saw that and God's going
[1:08:05] to say sorry the charges have been
[1:08:07] dismissed right amen they were never
[1:08:10] valid in the beginning because they had
[1:08:12] judged themsel by the word and in
[1:08:15] judging themselves I cannot judge them
[1:08:18] again now imagine God putting himself in
[1:08:21] a position to declare he will not Double
[1:08:24] Jeopardy you he will judge you by the
[1:08:27] word and when you go into the word and
[1:08:30] receive that judgment he says I can't
[1:08:33] judge you for that again thank you Lord
[1:08:35] all the more motivation to stay under
[1:08:38] the blood of Jesus Christ all the
[1:08:41] motivation to stand in the word amen and
[1:08:44] so God rich in Mercy is separating us
[1:08:48] right we just read the scripture uh uh
[1:08:50] and we see that but God in his Mercy is
[1:08:53] separating us and the great separation
[1:08:55] my brother and sister is not us from God
[1:08:58] but it's us from the spirit of leoda
[1:09:01] Amen God's moving in our lives to make
[1:09:04] the influence of leod DEA diminish day
[1:09:07] by day and as that diminishes Satan's
[1:09:11] grip on you is slipping now I tell you
[1:09:14] what he hates my brother and sister is
[1:09:16] when he looks out and I'm not going to
[1:09:18] name anybody today but when he looks out
[1:09:20] and he thought he had you thought he had
[1:09:24] me and realizes his grip is slipping or
[1:09:29] it has completely slipped amen when he
[1:09:32] thought I have that person praise God
[1:09:35] I've got
[1:09:38] them no he don't right because you see
[1:09:43] the power of God through this scripture
[1:09:45] declares to us what will separate it
[1:09:48] nothing amen nothing amen now everything
[1:09:53] that say Satan thinks he is my brother
[1:09:55] and sister we'll touch on this in a
[1:09:56] minute everything that Satan thinks he
[1:09:59] is is only because God has allowed
[1:10:04] him right so we're being separated now
[1:10:07] what is this L deia is uh the people's
[1:10:12] rights oh aren't you glad it's the age
[1:10:16] of people's
[1:10:17] rights too often this is what I was
[1:10:20] talking about earlier let our view be
[1:10:23] expanded
[1:10:24] the spirit of leoda people's rights we
[1:10:28] can preach oh age of Rights no no no but
[1:10:31] I thank God it's the age of Rights
[1:10:33] because I have the right to stand on
[1:10:36] every promise of God Amen I have the
[1:10:40] right to claim every attribute that God
[1:10:43] has given of the word in this day so I
[1:10:47] say praise God for people's rights if
[1:10:50] they want the right to live any way they
[1:10:52] want to sin and do all of that that's
[1:10:54] fine that's they're exercising their
[1:10:56] right but we as Believers are here this
[1:10:59] morning exercising our right to say I
[1:11:02] believe the word and the word is my life
[1:11:05] and the word is my hope and the word is
[1:11:07] everything that I need and I will exit
[1:11:10] this world here a conqueror amen amen
[1:11:15] because God has given you rights am now
[1:11:18] it's interesting how Satan wants to
[1:11:20] exercise his rights and he wants to
[1:11:21] limit your rights but we're not really
[1:11:24] giving him the option he can go pick it
[1:11:26] outside the building all he wants we're
[1:11:28] not going to listen to him amen so it's
[1:11:31] the age of people's rights look it's our
[1:11:34] right to be corrupted if we want to be
[1:11:37] it's our right to live in
[1:11:40] chaos now look at this I want to I want
[1:11:42] to really emphasize this chaos here my
[1:11:45] brother and sister when you get out and
[1:11:47] you rub shoulders with the world it is
[1:11:50] so
[1:11:51] interesting now I imagine everyone here
[1:11:53] at some time in their life has probably
[1:11:55] seen some kind of television show about
[1:11:58] some soap oper is kind of
[1:12:00] drama but do you realize why people feed
[1:12:03] on
[1:12:04] that is because their lives are
[1:12:07] reflection of
[1:12:11] that soap aw amen
[1:12:15] drama and we think no no no that's all
[1:12:18] made up no no no Satan's smart enough to
[1:12:21] produce something that's in
[1:12:24] their image that's
[1:12:26] right and then you see how the behavior
[1:12:29] starts to relate it's my right it's my
[1:12:34] right it's my
[1:12:36] right well good it's their life go live
[1:12:39] it in chaos if you want to but I don't
[1:12:42] like drama I don't like chaos I want to
[1:12:46] live in peace and Harmony I want to live
[1:12:48] in the presence of God I want to do that
[1:12:50] but the devil will come and he will try
[1:12:52] to create drama in our life he will do
[1:12:55] everything he can to stir you and I up
[1:12:57] amen husbands and wives and families and
[1:13:01] whatever it is he wants to put drama in
[1:13:03] there because you see the drama is the
[1:13:05] distraction that's right when there is
[1:13:08] peace and Harmony and when there's there
[1:13:10] there is where true communion and
[1:13:12] fellowship comes in but if he can keep
[1:13:15] us distracted in the drama then we'll
[1:13:17] never get beyond the drama to really get
[1:13:20] serious about the things of the Lord
[1:13:23] amen amen we have the right to live any
[1:13:26] old life that we want to live and that's
[1:13:29] good and bad you want to live in the
[1:13:30] city you can live in the city you want
[1:13:32] to live in the country you can live in
[1:13:33] the country amen you can even in this
[1:13:36] day if you wanted choose to live without
[1:13:38] electricity or running water you could
[1:13:40] choose those things my brother and
[1:13:42] sister because we have rights but we do
[1:13:45] have rights and I I want to reemphasize
[1:13:48] this we have rights to every promise of
[1:13:51] God am every promise of of God not a
[1:13:54] limitation that there would be this but
[1:13:56] that and we have rights my brother and
[1:13:59] sister to these promises no matter how
[1:14:02] strong you are amen how many times have
[1:14:06] we had thoughts go through our head if I
[1:14:08] can just get to this point I can
[1:14:10] overcome this well what if you never get
[1:14:13] to the point in yourself to
[1:14:17] overcome does that mean the promise to
[1:14:20] be an overcomer is now void no sir no
[1:14:23] sir that's where we as Sons and
[1:14:24] Daughters of God come to the point that
[1:14:26] we finally lay down and say Lord I've
[1:14:29] done all I can do I've got to give it to
[1:14:32] you now and when we give it to the Lord
[1:14:35] have you ever had that happen in your
[1:14:36] life amen pray over something and and
[1:14:39] just kind of half-hearted to approach it
[1:14:41] and then spend all your time chewing
[1:14:43] your fingernails off and and just
[1:14:46] struggling and laying awake all night
[1:14:48] and you do and then finally when it's
[1:14:50] coming almost like to a deadline almost
[1:14:52] to a time that that it's over and then
[1:14:55] you're so desperate you get down and say
[1:14:57] Lord I'm sorry that I didn't give this
[1:14:59] to you sooner but I'm giving it to you
[1:15:02] now and you wake up in the morning and
[1:15:04] find out it's
[1:15:05] solved amen that it's settled that it's
[1:15:08] no longer a problem because God never
[1:15:11] wanted it to be your problem in the
[1:15:13] beginning he stood there and said let it
[1:15:16] be my problem I'll take it just give it
[1:15:19] to me but we as humans hold on no Lord I
[1:15:24] can solve this I can overcome this that
[1:15:27] and the other I can do this Lord but the
[1:15:30] scripture says that God approaches this
[1:15:33] in such a way that no man can
[1:15:36] boast when it comes to the place that we
[1:15:38] no longer could do it in our s or we
[1:15:41] could no longer boast that I overcame
[1:15:45] and we give it to the Lord and he
[1:15:47] changes that and the only thing we can
[1:15:49] say then is the Lord was with me amen
[1:15:52] amen he's the Conqueror amen I'm just a
[1:15:56] flagbearer I'm just a laborer I'm just a
[1:15:59] foot soldier he's the
[1:16:02] Conqueror amen so it's not a promise
[1:16:06] when you're
[1:16:07] strong amen it's a promise no matter how
[1:16:10] weak we
[1:16:11] are but somehow isn't it interesting in
[1:16:14] the human element that we always equate
[1:16:17] to overcoming an issue in our life by
[1:16:20] strength when he said when you are weak
[1:16:23] that's it that's when I am strong amen
[1:16:27] Lord help us to remember that on the
[1:16:30] front end of the battle not in the
[1:16:33] desperates of the last moment of the
[1:16:35] battle but let us just remember you know
[1:16:37] how simple our life would be my brother
[1:16:39] and sister if every battle that we face
[1:16:42] like that we literally went and said
[1:16:44] Lord I know that you are the Conqueror
[1:16:47] you're the mighty one you're Jehovah
[1:16:50] you're elshad and I'm here to give this
[1:16:53] to you because you are the mighty
[1:16:56] conqueror imagine we could skip a week
[1:16:59] or two or a month or a year of fretting
[1:17:01] and chewing our nails and worrying about
[1:17:04] the problems around us are you listening
[1:17:11] Paul because when he said we're a
[1:17:14] conqueror amen it's because he knew we
[1:17:18] would come to a place that we would be
[1:17:22] the perfect ref reflection of
[1:17:27] him I want you to think how spiritual
[1:17:30] that is how deep that is that to
[1:17:34] come but the perfect reflection of him
[1:17:37] did have sacrifice and
[1:17:39] self-denial amen he learned obedience by
[1:17:44] the things he suffered and we as humans
[1:17:47] in that nature he's not looking down to
[1:17:49] make us suffer to learn that we just
[1:17:52] naturally step into into the suffering
[1:17:54] we naturally step in that sign up and
[1:17:56] say Lord just let me
[1:17:58] suffer
[1:18:01] right any of you had a prayer lately
[1:18:03] Lord I just want to
[1:18:07] suffer no that's not what God's called
[1:18:09] us to do but we will have Victory
[1:18:12] through suffering we'll have Victory
[1:18:15] because we're in His image and how he
[1:18:18] learned it my brother and sister he was
[1:18:20] using that to prove to you and I that if
[1:18:23] will just stand on the word he'll take
[1:18:26] care of it amen hallelujah amen now it's
[1:18:30] not a matter I say this in humor it's
[1:18:32] not a matter whether we suffer or not
[1:18:34] it's how long you want to
[1:18:37] suffer that might be the real question
[1:18:39] the real thing that we're determining
[1:18:41] here is how long we'll suffer before we
[1:18:44] lay it down before the
[1:18:51] Lord
[1:18:58] rights to every
[1:19:03] promise do you think we have enough time
[1:19:06] this morning to stroll Through the Bible
[1:19:08] and list every
[1:19:10] promise it take quite a long time
[1:19:12] wouldn't it and you have rights to that
[1:19:16] amen see the Prosperity Gospel
[1:19:20] evangelicals they're not all wrong you
[1:19:23] hear them roundly criticize for what
[1:19:25] they preach and how they approach the
[1:19:26] things of God but you realize they're
[1:19:28] not all wrong they've just taken it to
[1:19:31] the bar ditch on one side or the other
[1:19:34] they not remain balanced God cares about
[1:19:36] your
[1:19:38] Prosperity God cares about all of these
[1:19:41] things we're not going to go into this
[1:19:42] but we have to keep a balance are we
[1:19:45] here on this Earth to be
[1:19:47] mega no we're here on this Earth to be
[1:19:50] molded into the perfect image of Jesus
[1:19:53] Christ which
[1:19:55] translated in the new Paul
[1:19:58] English as being Mega Rich that's right
[1:20:02] when you've got Christ you're Mega Rich
[1:20:05] amen when you've got a big mansion and
[1:20:07] you've got millions in the bank you're
[1:20:10] just a
[1:20:11] heathen with a lot of
[1:20:14] money because that's not salvation
[1:20:17] that's right that's not the perfect plan
[1:20:19] of God that's not as it were
[1:20:23] the proper approach
[1:20:26] amen but God honoring Faith oh they have
[1:20:31] faith I just watched a little clip the
[1:20:33] other day I thought it was kind of
[1:20:35] interesting I kind of thought about
[1:20:37] trying it here but I I don't think it
[1:20:39] will work here but that would be that
[1:20:41] the preacher told the Deacon close the
[1:20:44] doors the offering was not enough Pass
[1:20:46] the Plate
[1:20:49] again would it work here
[1:20:53] I don't think so because you see once
[1:20:57] you get into the word and find balance
[1:21:00] you're not going to be conquered by
[1:21:04] anything God will keep you in Balance he
[1:21:08] will keep us in the word and I think
[1:21:11] that ought to be something we could
[1:21:12] actually go home and just Rejoice God's
[1:21:15] going to keep me balanced I I don't have
[1:21:17] to worry about I don't have to fret
[1:21:19] every day am I living a balanced
[1:21:21] Christian Life he proom promise to keep
[1:21:23] us lead us guide us into all truth so
[1:21:26] therefore Saints we have a promise to be
[1:21:28] balanced and every promise is mine every
[1:21:31] promise is yours that we can live in
[1:21:34] that and claim that promise it's not
[1:21:36] just about necessarily it all connects
[1:21:38] together but it's not just about
[1:21:40] salvation amen God gives us balance in
[1:21:43] every factor of our life and when we
[1:21:45] have a balance in every factor of our
[1:21:47] life then our life is not
[1:21:50] chaos our life is a life of peace peace
[1:21:52] and Harmony can we stretch our view of
[1:21:56] what being a Christian is in a world
[1:21:59] full of chaos are we the only ones that
[1:22:03] have balance no sir I can take you right
[1:22:05] out and introduce you to families that
[1:22:08] don't know one thing about the word of
[1:22:10] God they have
[1:22:13] balance but while they may raise perfect
[1:22:15] children and live in Perfect Harmony
[1:22:18] without the blood of Jesus
[1:22:21] Christ they're out of
[1:22:23] balance so balanced but so
[1:22:27] unbalanced and Satan don't mind if you
[1:22:30] are balanced but unbalanced because you
[1:22:32] can live all kinds of good lives but he
[1:22:35] still has you
[1:22:37] unbalanced now in the sermon the
[1:22:40] Rapture and then when the bride is being
[1:22:44] called out how you going to put it out
[1:22:47] it's a revelation of the manifestation
[1:22:50] of the word made true yeah what does the
[1:22:53] scripture says that there would be a
[1:22:55] secret calling away we call it the
[1:22:57] Rapture people want to be so critical
[1:23:00] about the message that God is giving
[1:23:02] they'll say there's no such word in the
[1:23:05] Bible therefore I cannot believe that
[1:23:07] but my brother and sister the secret
[1:23:09] catching away whether you call it
[1:23:11] catching away or you call it this or you
[1:23:13] call it that it's going to happen anyway
[1:23:16] whether you believe it or not whether
[1:23:19] you want the verbiage like it is or not
[1:23:21] it will come to past people say well
[1:23:23] that's not exactly the words of the
[1:23:25] Bible the Bible and your relationship to
[1:23:28] it is not about the exact words it's
[1:23:30] about the exact
[1:23:32] relationship and you can have all the
[1:23:34] perfect words and no
[1:23:37] relationship
[1:23:39] amen I could go off into a couple
[1:23:41] examples but I want to stay focused
[1:23:43] today and we're living in that day
[1:23:46] praise be to God the revelation of the
[1:23:48] mystery of himself see this is not my
[1:23:52] brother and sister about a group of
[1:23:54] churches or our church or that or that
[1:23:57] or that this is a revelation of Christ
[1:24:00] himself because the Revelation is not
[1:24:03] denomination the Revelation is not the
[1:24:05] church over there or those people down
[1:24:07] there the Revelation is you and him in a
[1:24:12] relationship and you can go to church
[1:24:14] all the days of your life and not have
[1:24:18] relationship and you could be born in a
[1:24:20] far off land in a jungle with almost no
[1:24:24] things of Modern Life and struggling to
[1:24:26] survive and have
[1:24:29] relationship it's not about whether God
[1:24:31] provides you a boat a car a plane a
[1:24:33] train or a big house this is about
[1:24:36] relationship and when that
[1:24:38] relationship's true you're a rich man or
[1:24:42] woman the mystery of himself now the
[1:24:45] Rapture is only the Rapture that we're
[1:24:47] talking about is only for the
[1:24:49] bride you know isn't it amazing my
[1:24:51] brother and sister these
[1:24:53] terminologies have become so
[1:24:57] common I read a little deal the other
[1:25:02] day it's kind of remarkable I don't want
[1:25:04] to sound judgmental but it's like just
[1:25:06] come join our church and be in the bride
[1:25:09] of
[1:25:10] Christ I can find no basis in scripture
[1:25:13] that's right for joining a church and
[1:25:15] that making you the
[1:25:17] bride now pardon me for just being Paul
[1:25:21] that would be no more than me going out
[1:25:24] here and catching the first lady walking
[1:25:27] down the
[1:25:28] street and saying I give you my
[1:25:33] name what if she doesn't want that
[1:25:37] name what if she says you're a
[1:25:40] weird calls the
[1:25:42] police and then I'm calling the trustees
[1:25:44] from jail come bail me out no see that's
[1:25:49] not what makes
[1:25:50] relationship Rel relationships much
[1:25:53] deeper and most of it just like any time
[1:25:56] a young man young woman are courting
[1:25:59] we'll just see a young man you know
[1:26:01] acting
[1:26:02] goofy and we'll see a young lady maybe
[1:26:05] with just a little smile a little
[1:26:08] Behavior but the roots of the
[1:26:10] relationship I'm talking about true
[1:26:11] Godly relationship the roots of the
[1:26:13] relationship are growing every day
[1:26:15] deeper deeper deeper deeper deeper until
[1:26:17] they're so intertwined and this is what
[1:26:20] I spoke on at uh
[1:26:22] at uh living words couples banquet why
[1:26:25] did she choose you
[1:26:29] brothers sisters why did he choose
[1:26:35] you but to catch the Revelation that a
[1:26:38] real marriage ordained in the eyes of
[1:26:40] God was in the foundation of the world
[1:26:43] not just some random girl that we
[1:26:45] decided she's pretty a Son of God
[1:26:48] doesn't go for looks he goes for
[1:26:49] character a daughter of God doesn't look
[1:26:52] for a bank account or rugged or handsome
[1:26:55] or this or that she looks for character
[1:26:57] and God himself would not put that in a
[1:27:00] natural relationship if he was not
[1:27:02] putting that in a spiritual relationship
[1:27:05] where's the character of the church why
[1:27:08] did he choose you and I my brother and
[1:27:10] sister as the word says before the
[1:27:12] foundation of the world why I ask you
[1:27:15] because we would be the smartest we're
[1:27:17] not the best looking we're not biggest
[1:27:21] church certainly not but he looked down
[1:27:24] through time and says there is the
[1:27:26] character of what I want to claim as my
[1:27:30] spiritual bride amen amen what was it
[1:27:33] he's the one who put the character isn't
[1:27:35] this a this is really
[1:27:38] loaded he's the one who put the nature
[1:27:41] and the character in you that's right
[1:27:44] get this now he puts the nature and
[1:27:46] character in you then he steps back and
[1:27:48] goes oh my how beautiful she is she has
[1:27:54] my nature and my
[1:27:58] character that's how God works that's
[1:28:00] right
[1:28:02] amen and I'm just going to finish the
[1:28:04] little thought here because sister Jerry
[1:28:06] reminds me some sometimes you didn't
[1:28:07] finish that thought and uh and it's true
[1:28:10] I I stop and I'm like oh yeah I only got
[1:28:12] halfway through that maybe I could send
[1:28:15] it out in the text nobody' understand
[1:28:18] that either
[1:28:20] so but you see
[1:28:22] the very
[1:28:23] nature of a man and a woman God put that
[1:28:28] in her to desire what's in you brother
[1:28:33] amen and he put in you in her yes anyway
[1:28:37] you guys know I just now got myself
[1:28:39] confused he put it in her that you would
[1:28:41] desire it he put that in you that she
[1:28:44] would desire it and then we come along
[1:28:46] and say oh thank the Lord I found true
[1:28:48] love no you didn't find true love God
[1:28:51] LED you you into true love he he
[1:28:53] revealed true love to you and that's
[1:28:56] exactly the very nature of God that he
[1:28:58] puts it there and says I'm going to put
[1:29:00] my nature in her and she's going to be
[1:29:03] my bride because she has my nature oh I
[1:29:07] thank God otherwise I'd be single
[1:29:09] probably
[1:29:12] today this nature is only for the bride
[1:29:14] remember the Bible said in the rest of
[1:29:16] the Dead lived not for a thousand years
[1:29:18] this great Rapture if there's not a
[1:29:20] Rapture friends then where are we at
[1:29:22] what are we going to do what age are we
[1:29:24] living in what promise do we have there
[1:29:27] is going to be a Rapture the Bible says
[1:29:30] there will be and it'll be only for the
[1:29:33] elected amen the elected lady the bride
[1:29:37] in this day that's pulled out what is it
[1:29:40] come out of her my people we never came
[1:29:44] out he pulled us out we never overcome
[1:29:48] he overcame amen we never now this is
[1:29:52] very technical some people would
[1:29:54] disagree we never believed he believed
[1:29:57] through US amen
[1:30:02] amen in other words there had to be a
[1:30:04] seed he placed in there that was the
[1:30:06] believer
[1:30:09] seed the elected lady the bride in this
[1:30:12] day that's pulled out the church the
[1:30:15] very Word Church means called out of as
[1:30:20] Moses called a nation out of a Nation
[1:30:23] the holy spirit is calling a bride out
[1:30:25] of a church a church out of a church
[1:30:28] members of every denomination making up
[1:30:30] a bride bride tree it's in the tape the
[1:30:33] bride tree a bride coming out call and
[1:30:36] that's the that's that the bride tree is
[1:30:39] the bride rather is the one that's going
[1:30:42] to be in the Rapture that alone nothing
[1:30:44] but the bride elected ones for known by
[1:30:48] God from the beginning the father's
[1:30:51] spirit rual jeans
[1:30:54] am
[1:30:56] my I seen a little deal the other day it
[1:30:58] showed these two little girls uh very
[1:31:01] pretty but very distinct facial features
[1:31:04] they were twins very distinct facial
[1:31:07] features and basically it's like can you
[1:31:10] guess what their mama looked
[1:31:14] like and they were the spitting image of
[1:31:18] their
[1:31:19] mama now I'm bringing this for a point
[1:31:21] don't please don't jump off to what
[1:31:23] where's he going with this but my
[1:31:26] brother and sister you see we have to be
[1:31:29] careful about whose
[1:31:31] genes that we are looking spiritually to
[1:31:36] express naturally it's fine Mama's a
[1:31:39] beautiful lady and the daughters are
[1:31:42] beautiful girls look like Mama we all
[1:31:44] Rejoice daddy is over here saying look
[1:31:47] at my beautiful girls they look just
[1:31:48] like your mama and I'm in love with my
[1:31:50] mom and I'm in love with them that's
[1:31:51] fine but we're the church which is a
[1:31:53] reflection of the
[1:31:55] woman amen we got to be careful what we
[1:31:59] boast about that we take after that's
[1:32:03] it yes now look at this as we go on here
[1:32:08] see the coming out the bride
[1:32:10] separation of people the only separation
[1:32:14] there is my brother and sister is in a
[1:32:16] yielding to the leadership of the Holy
[1:32:18] Spirit that's the only way there's
[1:32:20] separation we say I won't smoke and I
[1:32:22] won't drink that's not
[1:32:24] separation amen you can say well I I go
[1:32:27] to church I identify as a Christian
[1:32:29] that's still not separation there comes
[1:32:32] a time that there must be a yielding
[1:32:35] there must be something it is there uh
[1:32:38] yielding to the leadership of the Holy
[1:32:40] Spirit now follow me careful here
[1:32:42] leadership following the leadership of
[1:32:45] the Holy Spirit
[1:32:48] male that's right that's right okay
[1:32:52] okay see Lucifer himself was a part of
[1:32:56] the creation of God right what did that
[1:33:00] make him
[1:33:04] female are you with
[1:33:09] me and Lucifer
[1:33:12] coming a part of the creation
[1:33:15] feminine and the church is feminine amen
[1:33:19] and the church was not called to lead
[1:33:23] herself that's right so when you see
[1:33:27] Satan feminine leading the church
[1:33:31] feminine you have an effeminate
[1:33:34] relationship and I won't use because of
[1:33:37] our young people the direct words
[1:33:38] associated with that but you know where
[1:33:40] I'm going when two women have a
[1:33:42] relationship amen so you're looking at
[1:33:45] Lucifer leading the church it is not a
[1:33:49] balanced relationship it is a
[1:33:51] relationship that is now outside of the
[1:33:54] word of God because the woman a feminite
[1:33:58] is not to lead the church uh feminine or
[1:34:03] feminine I guess I'm using the wrong
[1:34:04] word feminine but you look at that see
[1:34:08] so what happens is is this church in
[1:34:10] this day part of the restoration people
[1:34:12] say well these things uh critics would
[1:34:15] say well you guys believe this message
[1:34:16] you're just following them nan no sorry
[1:34:18] I'm following the word but God sent a
[1:34:21] man that Drew our attention to these
[1:34:23] things and we recognize this is not in
[1:34:26] order so by that uh recognition it is
[1:34:30] not following a man or otherwise we're
[1:34:32] wandering around the Wilderness because
[1:34:34] that man is
[1:34:35] gone but we're not wandering around the
[1:34:37] Wilderness we're in the word and the
[1:34:39] word's taking us through the Wilderness
[1:34:41] into the promise amen so it's there that
[1:34:44] we recognize this is now I can get
[1:34:46] complicated here and and I just want to
[1:34:49] bounce the edge of it amen when Dayan T
[1:34:51] come up they rose up they said you know
[1:34:54] what we're just as spiritual as you are
[1:34:56] Moses and we believe that you're hogging
[1:34:59] all the glory and hogging all the tithes
[1:35:01] and hogging all of this and all of that
[1:35:03] we're just as spiritual as you are but
[1:35:06] daythan and Kora were not called to lead
[1:35:08] the church so here was a feminine Spirit
[1:35:11] trying to lead a feminine spirit and it
[1:35:14] was nothing but chaos and the scripture
[1:35:17] says that the Earth opened up and
[1:35:19] consumed them I want you to look out
[1:35:22] here not judgmental we love these people
[1:35:24] but you look out here and see who's
[1:35:27] consuming them they're not consumed of
[1:35:29] the Holy Ghost they're not consumed of
[1:35:31] obeying the word they're consumed of
[1:35:34] their own Spirit their own leadership
[1:35:36] their own interpretation because you've
[1:35:39] got a feminine Spirit leading a church
[1:35:41] which is feminine it's perversion is
[1:35:44] what it
[1:35:45] is amen so what have they do they must
[1:35:50] come out of that Spirit get back to the
[1:35:53] leadership of Jesus Christ the
[1:35:56] male amen he's the husband he's the
[1:35:59] headship he's the leadership we can't
[1:36:02] lead ourselves we have to trust him to
[1:36:06] lead us and I I hope I'm not speaking
[1:36:08] this too strong I it could be much
[1:36:10] stronger I can assure you but it's there
[1:36:13] that we are not called to even lead
[1:36:15] ourselves you say but God's given me
[1:36:17] Revelation and I see the opening of the
[1:36:19] word that's fine follow your husband
[1:36:23] follow the word follow the leadership of
[1:36:25] the holy spirit amen otherwise you just
[1:36:28] get off in another ISM that's right
[1:36:33] amen and here's something I find
[1:36:36] remarkable the
[1:36:38] bride doesn't even want to lead herself
[1:36:41] that's
[1:36:42] right it's not a fuss and a fight for
[1:36:46] headship the bride doesn't even want to
[1:36:49] lead herself amen she finds
[1:36:53] comfort and
[1:36:56] peace in her
[1:36:59] relationship that's it you see I don't
[1:37:01] want our relationship with the Lord to
[1:37:03] be a soap opera that's right I don't
[1:37:06] want it to be a drama I don't want it to
[1:37:09] be
[1:37:10] chaos I want to get up in the morning
[1:37:14] and know who's in charge I want to get
[1:37:18] up in the morning and know that he
[1:37:20] already knows what I'll face that day
[1:37:21] and he's already made the way for me am
[1:37:24] that I can stand and just live with
[1:37:26] confidence and say Lord I kind of
[1:37:29] stepped out of line you reminded me that
[1:37:31] wasn't the right
[1:37:32] attitude now I don't even want to go
[1:37:34] into that but I believe we could say
[1:37:36] that we understand what it means to not
[1:37:38] have right attitudes Amen to be under
[1:37:41] wrong influences and and how that brings
[1:37:44] about things and and after that spirit's
[1:37:47] broken we look back and say how did I
[1:37:49] get there but you see all it took was
[1:37:52] one little
[1:37:54] misstep doesn't take running off way
[1:37:56] outside the word and running way over
[1:37:59] here no Satan is so on top of your life
[1:38:03] are you with me Satan so on top of your
[1:38:06] life that one little
[1:38:10] misstep you want an example go to
[1:38:12] Genesis and when Lucifer is speaking to
[1:38:15] Eve he just takes Lord out of the
[1:38:18] equation so it's no longer the Lord God
[1:38:22] he just starts saying God what was he
[1:38:25] doing
[1:38:26] depersonalizing
[1:38:28] desensitizing removing the
[1:38:31] intimacy removing the closeness of the
[1:38:34] relationship to say that's just God and
[1:38:38] God doesn't really
[1:38:39] care but my brother and sister the Lord
[1:38:42] God cares I don't care what word you put
[1:38:45] to it how you want to call it name it do
[1:38:48] whatever you want I dealt with a man
[1:38:50] that was like no it has to be this this
[1:38:53] and this when you identify God and I
[1:38:55] saidwell I'm sorry but my Bible says and
[1:38:57] they didn't care they had it fact you
[1:38:59] had to be right here to identify God
[1:39:01] that way and that's the only way God
[1:39:02] would know you but a prophet said you
[1:39:04] know God Jesus Christ the holy spirit
[1:39:08] all the same
[1:39:13] thing all the same thing
[1:39:19] amen so this wants Divine leadership of
[1:39:22] the Holy Ghost which is Christ himself
[1:39:24] that's right now I'm going to say this
[1:39:26] very blunt I hope you don't
[1:39:28] mind but I'm telling you there there's
[1:39:30] no woman who is faithful to her husband
[1:39:32] living in her vow wants another husband
[1:39:36] that's right she doesn't want another
[1:39:40] man that's in her life she's got one man
[1:39:44] god-given that's right in her life and
[1:39:46] she's happy amen is that yeah I think
[1:39:50] that's funny because we've often heard
[1:39:52] you know men can go back and say well
[1:39:54] it's scriptural Lord this woman thou
[1:39:57] Hast given
[1:40:01] me well what if we'd start repeating
[1:40:04] that when she cooked our favorite meal
[1:40:06] and made us a dessert and you know lift
[1:40:09] your eyes to heaven and say Lord this
[1:40:12] woman that thou has given me but usually
[1:40:16] we're upset when we say
[1:40:19] it yeah honey I wrecked the car Lord
[1:40:22] this woman thou Hast given
[1:40:24] me honey will have to go out to eat I
[1:40:27] burnt supper all the windows in the
[1:40:29] house are open the fire alarms are going
[1:40:31] off the fire department's called the
[1:40:33] cars is driving down the road coming
[1:40:35] beat on the door and said is everybody
[1:40:37] safe in
[1:40:38] here Lord the woman thou has given
[1:40:45] me we also preached at the couple's
[1:40:47] banquet and I was preaching to myself
[1:40:51] if we'll move from
[1:40:53] obligation in our relationship to
[1:40:59] privilege come on be with
[1:41:01] me amen we can get into all kinds of
[1:41:04] things I'm working my fingers to the
[1:41:05] bones I'm tired my back hurts my knees
[1:41:07] hurt this hurts that hurts and I'm
[1:41:09] exhausted and I'm doing all this and
[1:41:11] nobody nobody seems to care and that
[1:41:13] what that does is just starts Strife it
[1:41:15] starts chaos it starts an undermining it
[1:41:18] starts a drama but if we had stop and
[1:41:21] say Lord you bless me with a wife you
[1:41:23] bless me with Children what a privileged
[1:41:26] man that I am and Lord you bless me with
[1:41:29] the revelation of your word you bless me
[1:41:32] Lord that I can see my nature is
[1:41:34] changing oh what a blessed man that I am
[1:41:38] amen hallelujah but Satan wants to say
[1:41:40] isn't it so hard to go to church isn't
[1:41:43] it so hard to line up with the word of
[1:41:46] God just God doesn't care just move over
[1:41:51] a little bit it gets a little easier
[1:41:54] yeah you know do a little research might
[1:41:56] be a fun homework fact for you the
[1:41:59] reason that people die in
[1:42:02] quicksand is because the quicksand has a
[1:42:06] bottom on the
[1:42:10] edges it's not
[1:42:12] solid the warning is there all the
[1:42:17] time but because they're not sinking as
[1:42:21] much as they would think or would cause
[1:42:23] the alarm to go
[1:42:25] off they just keep
[1:42:28] walking until that little dry
[1:42:34] surface breaks
[1:42:36] through and then devil
[1:42:38] says
[1:42:42] gotcha and the more you fight to get out
[1:42:44] of
[1:42:45] it the deeper you
[1:42:48] go because you see we we can't get out
[1:42:51] of this on our own that's right we get
[1:42:54] out of it because the Lord comes and
[1:42:57] rescues us amen
[1:43:01] hallelujah so we get to
[1:43:05] express amen our father's jeans that's
[1:43:10] right amen so how do we come out by
[1:43:13] stepping into the
[1:43:14] word amen how does a man get out of
[1:43:18] quick sand in the natural the minute
[1:43:21] usually somewhere about his knees that
[1:43:23] he realizes he's in quick sand the first
[1:43:26] thing we must do is prostrate ourself
[1:43:30] and start going back where we know we
[1:43:33] need to be that's right but if we think
[1:43:36] that we can walk on our
[1:43:38] own study it it's a very very good
[1:43:41] spiritual analogy amen the minute you
[1:43:44] think you can walk out of that problem
[1:43:46] you'll just get your problem deeper but
[1:43:49] the minute that you will prostrate with
[1:43:50] yourself and then bow down from get away
[1:43:54] from your own ideas get away from
[1:43:56] everything and yes you're going to be
[1:43:58] muddy you're going to be slimy you're
[1:44:00] going to be scared to death but you can
[1:44:02] crawl as it is like I don't know how do
[1:44:04] you describe that a turtle I don't want
[1:44:07] to use spiders I don't like
[1:44:10] spiders but you can lay down and you can
[1:44:12] work your way out of that why on your
[1:44:15] face you can't get out of the quicksand
[1:44:17] on your back you got to be on your face
[1:44:20] and are working your way out of this and
[1:44:23] when you get on your face God comes on
[1:44:25] the scene because he said I hear your
[1:44:28] voice when you call in fact the answer
[1:44:31] is already on the way that's right amen
[1:44:35] oh hallelujah amen and who would know
[1:44:38] we'd go in the jungle and find an
[1:44:40] analogy of repentance before the Lord
[1:44:42] and restoration of our
[1:44:45] relationship amen amen step out of the
[1:44:48] flesh you know intellect
[1:44:52] I'm going to say this it sounds rough
[1:44:53] but I'm just going to say it in my time
[1:44:56] I've met quite a few intellectual
[1:44:59] Christians they're no longer Christians
[1:45:04] amen now I've seen intellectual
[1:45:06] Christians get
[1:45:08] converted to real
[1:45:10] Christians we didn't need as it were to
[1:45:14] be able to quote a 100
[1:45:16] scriptures if God give you that kind of
[1:45:19] mind so be it God bless you that's no
[1:45:20] sign that you're lost but that's not a
[1:45:23] sign you're saved either that's
[1:45:28] right you see when God calls us out come
[1:45:31] out of her my people when he called us
[1:45:33] out he had already prepared a place for
[1:45:36] us to go in amen God never calls a man
[1:45:39] out or a family a sister whatever it be
[1:45:42] never calls them out and just leaves
[1:45:44] them in limbo that's right my brother
[1:45:46] and sister there's many people that
[1:45:48] didn't go all the way in you know it's
[1:45:49] actually scary to come in the presence
[1:45:51] of God yes it and a lot of people
[1:45:54] sensitive to that become afraid to take
[1:45:57] the next
[1:45:59] step God called them out there standing
[1:46:02] there afraid to take the next
[1:46:07] step what's there for
[1:46:09] him you know we as humans are made to go
[1:46:12] to the
[1:46:13] known you know that just look at the
[1:46:16] nature as it is how we are as humans
[1:46:22] it takes a brave man to hunt the
[1:46:23] Wilderness where he's never been before
[1:46:26] that's
[1:46:27] right it's easy to go hunt the same
[1:46:31] little spot every single
[1:46:35] time and there's a thousand analogies
[1:46:37] that go with
[1:46:39] that you see we tend to go back to our
[1:46:44] comfort
[1:46:46] zone you know what that means our
[1:46:48] comfort zone means we're not trusting
[1:46:50] God
[1:46:51] yes sir that's right because he said I
[1:46:52] called you out just trust me to take you
[1:46:56] in and we've all been called out today
[1:46:59] can we say Amen we've been called out
[1:47:02] let's trust him to take us in amen we
[1:47:05] don't have to go back to what we know
[1:47:07] what's familiar but just go and step
[1:47:10] into this promise amen now in the Easter
[1:47:14] seal oh sorry about that
[1:47:17] Brothers Easter
[1:47:19] seal as we look at
[1:47:26] this I want to today I wonder today
[1:47:30] where we are at I ask you where is this
[1:47:34] Resurrection finding
[1:47:38] us are you dare to step
[1:47:41] out you dare to take God at his
[1:47:45] word if you're ordained to life you will
[1:47:49] sure surely do it that's
[1:47:54] right can we just stop for a
[1:47:57] moment and think of that where are
[1:48:02] we have we totally stepped
[1:48:06] out and from our heart be able to say
[1:48:09] Lord I trust you that's
[1:48:11] it see because I I want to go over this
[1:48:14] I have many times in the past but I want
[1:48:16] to just go over it today when um the
[1:48:19] scripture
[1:48:21] says I will lead you and guide you into
[1:48:26] all
[1:48:28] truth is that because we believe William
[1:48:30] brandham is a prophet sent to this
[1:48:36] day that was God himself talking to you
[1:48:39] that's exactly right so some people say
[1:48:41] you're following a man well I I just
[1:48:44] hate to tell you if I'm following a man
[1:48:46] I'm not doing a very good job of it
[1:48:48] because he said I'm point pointing you
[1:48:50] to Jesus Christ and oh let me just
[1:48:53] dramatize this we're standing here
[1:48:55] having this conversation and and he says
[1:48:58] you know what um I never called you to
[1:49:01] follow me I just wanted to introduce you
[1:49:03] to Jesus Christ now let's look at it
[1:49:05] from Jesus's point of view I'm going to
[1:49:07] lead you and guide you into all truth
[1:49:10] and here is the man of the hour and we
[1:49:13] go over here and the word starts to
[1:49:15] change our life because we're reading
[1:49:17] our Bibles a little bit different than
[1:49:19] we did before we're starting to realize
[1:49:21] this is not to a bishop this is not to a
[1:49:24] priest this is not to a a fantastic man
[1:49:27] over here this is not to the
[1:49:29] denomination over there he was talking
[1:49:31] to me amen amen his word was talking to
[1:49:34] me and he stood there and looked me in
[1:49:37] the face and said I will lead you and
[1:49:40] guide you into all truth my brother and
[1:49:43] sister I mean no disrespect but I looked
[1:49:46] Suddenly at that moment wait he's the
[1:49:49] one that made this promise to me it's
[1:49:51] not a man it's not a church it's not a
[1:49:54] deal here it's not some group it's
[1:49:56] Christ himself said I will lead you and
[1:49:59] guide you and people say you're
[1:50:00] following a man I'm sorry I got handed
[1:50:03] off like a football many years ago to my
[1:50:07] Lord Jesus Christ he's my leader amen
[1:50:10] he's who I'm following he's the one I
[1:50:13] Look to I've learned that man can fail
[1:50:16] me but Jesus Christ can never fail me
[1:50:20] amen man might have good intentions but
[1:50:23] he'll still come short but my Lord Jesus
[1:50:26] I don't have to worry about how he looks
[1:50:29] at me whether it's a good day or a bad
[1:50:31] day he said I'll Lead You Lord help me
[1:50:34] just to follow amen help me to have
[1:50:37] enough confidence just to follow that's
[1:50:40] right I don't need somebody to come and
[1:50:42] say look God sent me for you to follow
[1:50:44] me and I'll lead you no sorry we've
[1:50:48] already seen that bus go it's left we
[1:50:53] are now following our lord Jesus
[1:50:56] Hallelujah what's happening my brother
[1:50:58] and sister as we get closer more and
[1:51:01] more word is coming to pass more and
[1:51:03] more things are being revealed around us
[1:51:06] more and more that we see history amen
[1:51:09] sister Sue thank you for all the gifts
[1:51:11] of the books on Israel I have been
[1:51:14] reading them right and left and you know
[1:51:17] what what started in their war of indep
[1:51:20] dependence what started through every
[1:51:23] war through their ages right down to
[1:51:25] this time right now is so perfectly
[1:51:29] lined in scripture and you want to know
[1:51:32] what it is it's never changed the battle
[1:51:34] that they're fighting right now is the
[1:51:37] same route has come in the very time of
[1:51:40] Independence in The Six Day War coming
[1:51:43] right up through 73 and right on through
[1:51:45] all of these wars it's the same exact

[1:52:13] vision I don't suggest you say this to
[1:52:16] their face they get
[1:52:17] angry but in one of these books I was
[1:52:19] read reading this man talking to one of
[1:52:21] those Muslim

[1:58:04] Chris and wouldn't you know the minute
[1:58:07] you want to share something you can't
[1:58:08] find
[1:58:09] it but I searched and searched and
[1:58:11] searched until it popped up and amazing
[1:58:15] if you misspell things they just don't
[1:58:17] pop
[1:58:18] up
[1:58:20] H but I tell you what happens God don't
[1:58:22] care whether you can
[1:58:24] spell amen one of the brothers up there
[1:58:28] well
[1:58:29] anyway I got to break this habit of
[1:58:31] throwing sister Jerry under the
[1:58:33] bus but we were talking about some stuff
[1:58:36] up there and I'd wrote out a deal there
[1:58:38] and and uh brother made a comment about
[1:58:41] he couldn't read my writing and sister
[1:58:44] Jerry we were joking this is all in
[1:58:46] humor she like yeah he can't spell
[1:58:48] either
[1:58:51] and and I'm going to admit it you know
[1:58:55] um if I stop and think I can
[1:58:58] spell but I've got so many places to go
[1:59:00] and so many things to do and so many
[1:59:02] thoughts to process I don't have time to
[1:59:05] remember all the rules of i before e
[1:59:08] except after
[1:59:13] b or
[1:59:17] d f
[1:59:21] gee man-made rules yes sir those of you

[1:59:34] realm yeah you guys didn't buy that at
[1:59:38] all did
[1:59:40] you anyway so if you saw my own notes
[1:59:43] right now and the reason I even said

[1:59:47] like that's spelled wrong I'm the one
[1:59:50] that spelled
