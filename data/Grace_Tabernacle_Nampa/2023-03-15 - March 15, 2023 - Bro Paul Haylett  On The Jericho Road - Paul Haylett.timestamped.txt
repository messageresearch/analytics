[30:58] n't it wonderful the Lord has given us
[31:00] the privilege
[31:03] when we get to heaven
[31:05] Saints we will sing the songs of
[31:07] redemption
[31:09] and you know I just caught in this
[31:13] thought
[31:15] when we realize we can sing something
[31:17] that even the angels
[31:19] will fall silent
[31:23] we'd say well they never fell they they
[31:25] don't have to do that but my brother and
[31:28] sister
[31:29] how great it is we see The Parables
[31:32] through the word of God how great it is
[31:34] redemption
[31:37] amen it is not just something of the
[31:40] failure
[31:41] but it is of the perfect plan of God to
[31:44] redeem us to call us
[31:46] I want to be able to lift my voice on
[31:48] the other side I want to sing loud and
[31:51] clear and to be able to sing from the
[31:54] depths of my soul to say thank you Lord
[31:57] for saving my soul oh Hallelujah God
[32:01] bless you Saints good to see each one
[32:03] tonight those who would not be with us
[32:06] we just pray the Lord would just come
[32:08] down and touch them be with them and say
[32:12] either home or travel or whatever the
[32:15] situation might be amen
[32:17] and uh
[32:19] you know I I don't know I imagine most
[32:22] of you that uh
[32:25] sister April has shared
[32:28] uh the last one she shared with us so I
[32:30] don't know if we're all on the same page
[32:32] but how my heart just broke
[32:36] for the little girl did she share that
[32:39] with you in the church here the little
[32:40] girl that burnt herself just missed her
[32:42] eye burned herself on the side of her
[32:45] face her ears shoulder
[32:47] let's remember they're nameless to us
[32:50] they're faceless to us
[32:53] but they have a soul
[32:55] and they suffer and let's just be
[32:58] faithful as as a church to to lift them
[33:02] up
[33:02] amen I I view it just my personal
[33:05] expression as uh sister April there in
[33:08] her humanitarian effort but she'll be a
[33:12] witness
[33:13] amen a light in the darkness that we may
[33:18] never more than likely would never have
[33:20] opportunity and and it has an impact
[33:24] Amen to realize that that God allows
[33:28] these things and places that and
[33:31] to by natural gifts that were given to
[33:34] be a doctor to touch lives
[33:37] but there is there the expression of one
[33:40] connecting as it is Woman to Woman
[33:45] you might say sister to sister and have
[33:47] them speak their words and she's there
[33:51] as she expressed I'm not there to try to
[33:54] correct
[33:55] I'm there to just live
[33:57] and let's just remember those those
[33:59] people
[34:00] amen I want to continue on tonight thank
[34:05] you musicians brother Tim appreciate
[34:07] that and uh
[34:09] we just appreciate the gifts that God
[34:12] has placed in the body
[34:14] I want to speak to you once again on our
[34:16] journey
[34:17] and uh you know as we travel
[34:20] it uh we uh
[34:24] go we see we encounter we experience
[34:28] and tonight we're going to take a trip
[34:32] on the Jericho Road
[34:33] and uh the Jericho Road my brother and
[34:36] sister obviously as we go into the
[34:39] scripture was uh not always
[34:43] a friendly place
[34:45] not always a place to feel comfortable
[34:48] in your travels not always a place that
[34:51] people were blessed and let's turn into
[34:53] a book of Luke the 10th chapter
[34:56] starting with the 25th the verse
[35:04] and
[35:06] this story that we're going to read and
[35:11] embrace tonight
[35:13] actually probably has a minimum
[35:17] of a half a dozen sermons contained
[35:19] within it
[35:21] encapsulated you might say and in that
[35:24] there's several different thoughts but
[35:26] this is the direction we feel led to go
[35:28] tonight
[35:30] and we we see you can go back in Luke 10
[35:34] and catch the whole story but we see how
[35:36] this comes now and and Jesus is there
[35:40] you know the Pharisees and Sadducees and
[35:43] everyone's just
[35:46] they're just not happy
[35:48] here's somebody who has abandoned the
[35:51] program
[35:56] Lord help us to never have a program
[36:00] but here's someone
[36:02] who is abandoning the program and
[36:05] they're not happy
[36:07] now
[36:08] this is stuff that's going to be left to
[36:11] the Messiah when he comes
[36:14] this is the supernatural that would be
[36:17] given only to one of a superior
[36:21] spiritual position and here's this
[36:24] interloper who has broken
[36:27] the program
[36:30] amazing my brother and sister how it can
[36:32] be that the very one that they preach
[36:35] about
[36:36] they pray about
[36:38] and look forward to
[36:40] could be right in their midst
[36:43] and miss it
[36:44] entirely Lord help us amen keep us
[36:49] focused Lord
[36:51] that we don't miss it because of the
[36:55] program
[36:59] and behold
[37:01] of Luke 10
[37:03] and behold a certain lawyer stood up and
[37:06] tempted him saying master
[37:08] what shall I do to inherit eternal life
[37:13] and he said unto him what is written in
[37:16] the law
[37:17] how readest thou
[37:20] and he answering and he answering said
[37:23] thou shall love the Lord thy God with
[37:25] all thy heart and with all thy soul and
[37:28] with all thy strength and with all thy
[37:31] mind and thy neighbor as thyself
[37:36] and he said unto him thou Hast answered
[37:40] right this do
[37:42] and thou shalt live
[37:45] this is not
[37:47] a long drawn-out explanation of creation
[37:52] of redemption
[37:54] of our place in the temple our place in
[37:57] the Kingdom
[37:59] it doesn't get much simpler
[38:03] in a very complicated way
[38:07] than this
[38:10] what did the prophet tell us he said God
[38:12] comes in simplicity
[38:14] and he reveals himself
[38:17] in the same amen
[38:21] but he willing
[38:23] this might have been Paul that was
[38:25] sitting here I'm sorry to say tonight
[38:27] but he willing to justify himself
[38:31] said unto Jesus and who is my neighbor
[38:35] Jesus answering said a certain man went
[38:38] down from Jerusalem to Jericho and fell
[38:41] Amongst Thieves which stripped him of
[38:44] his raiment and wounded him and departed
[38:46] leaving him half dead
[38:50] and by chance there come down a certain
[38:52] you know there's nothing by chance
[38:56] I love how God lays this out the word
[38:58] says and by chance but it wasn't by
[39:01] chance God knew this man would walk down
[39:03] there
[39:04] come down a certain priest that way and
[39:08] when he saw him
[39:09] he passed by on the other side and
[39:12] likewise a levite when he was at the
[39:16] place came and looked on him and passed
[39:19] by on the other side but a certain
[39:21] Samaritan as he journeyed came where he
[39:24] was and when he saw him he had
[39:27] compassion on him and went to him and
[39:30] bound up his wounds pouring in oil and
[39:34] wine and set him on his own beast and
[39:37] brought him to an inn and took care of
[39:39] him and on the morrow when he departed
[39:42] he took out two pence and gave them to
[39:45] the host and said unto him take care of
[39:48] him and whatsoever thou spendeth more
[39:51] when I come again I will repay thee
[39:55] Heavenly Father we just ask you to bless
[39:57] the Saints tonight in your precious name
[39:59] amen you may be seated
[40:04] as we would look at this to go back into
[40:07] the scriptures we would see here my
[40:09] brother and sister that you know it's
[40:12] the unbeliever that always has the
[40:14] question of Temptation on their mind and
[40:16] it's always their way of trying to be
[40:19] provocative uh not constructively they
[40:22] believe it is but you know this this
[40:25] lawyer would have just loved to have
[40:28] proven a point uh on which uh Jesus
[40:32] would have looked negative and uh so
[40:34] it's there that we realize that as it is
[40:37] that uh the the spirit has always been
[40:41] here but my brother and sister it's even
[40:43] actually here today people would come
[40:45] and they would say well you know we just
[40:48] don't believe what you believe we
[40:49] believe you're caught up in this and
[40:51] that and isn't it amazing if I could
[40:53] just put it in this context tonight that
[40:56] when God gave a promise in this page of
[40:58] the Bible he actually gave the
[41:01] unbeliever something to declare
[41:03] compromise on this page of the the Bible
[41:05] so it all depends on the spirit of the
[41:08] reader as to what he actually gets from
[41:11] the page amen and so it's there that if
[41:14] we are looking for the positive we will
[41:16] see the positive if we are looking to
[41:18] the negative we will see the negative
[41:20] and you know they have a term in the
[41:23] modern day that we live in called cause
[41:25] cognitive dissonance and you know it's
[41:27] there that you know you can just fool
[41:30] yourself as their premise you read and
[41:32] you just believe what you want to
[41:33] believe and I say Amen to that amen
[41:37] because there's something down inside of
[41:39] me when I read this word and I study the
[41:43] message of the hour there's something
[41:45] inside of me says that is the truth
[41:48] believe it and my body you know my
[41:51] spirit says amen I believe that now am I
[41:55] here brainwashed well they did a really
[41:57] poor job because you know there's things
[41:59] in my life that I come up against and
[42:01] and I have to just to satisfy the flesh
[42:04] man man now I hope you follow me tonight
[42:06] there's things if I can put in this
[42:09] context there's things I Paul come up to
[42:12] that I have to satisfy for this flesh
[42:15] man which means I have to go back and
[42:17] dig into something to make sure it is
[42:20] what it says it is
[42:23] therefore I'm not going to just throw it
[42:25] all up and say whatever it is said I
[42:27] believe it I need to see as it were for
[42:30] myself and you know the prophet of God
[42:32] said if there's things that you don't
[42:34] understand you know I'm going to put
[42:36] this in my words don't make a big deal
[42:38] out of it don't stumble over this don't
[42:40] let it stumble you and cause you to turn
[42:43] back just put it on the shelf and you
[42:45] just wait and God will confirm it in his
[42:48] time and I can tell you tonight he's
[42:51] done that over and over and over in my
[42:54] life than I have had a question about
[42:56] something and then just seemingly out of
[42:59] the blue right it's not by accident it's
[43:02] not by chance it's the season that God
[43:04] says I'm going to Enlighten or give you
[43:06] Revelation concerning these things and
[43:09] there it becomes very clear to you now
[43:12] my brother and sister in that state we
[43:14] don't have to back up and say Lord
[43:16] forgive me because as I've said many
[43:18] times and it is a little thing that I
[43:21] don't know where I even got it from but
[43:22] I I I don't have a problem myself uh
[43:26] stating this that it's all right to ask
[43:29] God a question it's not right to
[43:33] question God
[43:35] there's a tremendous difference between
[43:38] those two and if I ask each one of you
[43:41] tonight what is the difference we would
[43:43] get you know the same same thing with
[43:45] different verbiage but my brother and
[43:47] sister God is allowing us to come as
[43:50] humans he created us to come and to get
[43:54] an answer or to ask the question to get
[43:56] the answer and the other is actually
[43:59] questioning as they say maybe the moral
[44:03] or
[44:05] fiber of the being
[44:07] in other words you can ask a question in
[44:09] such a way you're almost telling someone
[44:11] you're a liar
[44:12] right and still put a question mark on
[44:15] the end
[44:16] so we come we ask God questions and God
[44:19] says I'll give you answers just be
[44:20] patient
[44:21] so we look at this and see now that uh
[44:24] this lawyer is trying to trying to put
[44:27] this in such a way to put Jesus in a bad
[44:30] light but what does Jesus do he tells
[44:32] him you know what what I want you to do
[44:34] is I want you to go back to the word and
[44:37] I want you to tell me when you read the
[44:39] word what did it tell you and so what
[44:42] does he do now the lawyer probably being
[44:45] clever enough would look and say well if
[44:47] I deviate from the words of Moses in one
[44:51] iota I'm the one that looks bad here and
[44:54] so it's there that all he can do is
[44:57] respond with the word
[45:00] now whether he really believed that word
[45:02] and it really had effect in his life or
[45:04] not that's all he could speak and I want
[45:06] to throw this out to you this is why
[45:08] some of the greatest uh uh frauds going
[45:11] on in the world today in the name of
[45:13] religion are preaching the gospel and
[45:16] you would say Well they're preaching the
[45:18] word that's what they're saying that's
[45:19] what they're saying but my brother and
[45:21] sister it's not what come out of their
[45:23] mouth it's what's in their spirit and
[45:26] they're using the gospel for their own
[45:28] benefit they're actually twisting it
[45:30] while they're using the exact words and
[45:33] so here's a lawyer who is twisting but
[45:36] yet has to use the words because he
[45:38] himself cannot deviate from the word
[45:42] otherwise he marks himself
[45:46] so he says how do you read it
[45:48] and as I already shared with you we can
[45:52] read this a lot of different ways my
[45:53] brother and sister one of them coming
[45:55] back that is is uh just something that
[45:58] we'll uh probably go on in Bible study
[46:01] down the road here and just go real slow
[46:03] through the prophet of God showing us
[46:06] through the word the godhead but as
[46:08] we'll look at this now that we realize
[46:11] What's Happening Here with this lawyer
[46:14] is that he is going to have to Now voice
[46:19] his Revelation or how he reads the word
[46:23] see how Jesus has turned that around
[46:27] this is a long thing to go out but
[46:30] you'll see that's what Jesus actually
[46:32] did to the disciples
[46:34] he said who do you say I am it was no
[46:38] longer what you said Jesus it's no
[46:40] longer the words we can quote of your
[46:41] words but now we have to come and speak
[46:44] it back out and that's what God wants
[46:47] you and I today not as a test as it were
[46:50] but to be able to come because the word
[46:53] coming back from us not just what we
[46:55] took in but what's coming back from us
[46:57] defines us and as the Bride of Jesus
[47:00] Christ in this hour we're asking God to
[47:03] reveal to us every Gap every shortcoming
[47:07] every void everything we don't have now
[47:10] this is not a message of knowledge that
[47:13] we quote it back to get into heaven but
[47:16] it's here that this bride of Christ
[47:17] wants to know who her bridegroom is he
[47:20] wants to know what he desires from her
[47:23] and so she is there in putting herself
[47:26] in a position that Lord I heard but now
[47:28] I want to speak because I want to be
[47:31] able to comprehend I want to be able to
[47:34] speak this out and to have a prayer
[47:36] every day of Our Lives Lord if I'm not
[47:39] right if there's something there correct
[47:40] me that is something we should do and so
[47:43] it's there that we find that uh the same
[47:47] scriptures my brother and sister that we
[47:49] would use Matthew 28 19 Acts 2 38
[47:53] entirely different interpretations
[47:55] entirely different when they when they
[47:58] bring this back out and speak this back
[48:01] out they're going two different
[48:02] directions and we were just discussing
[48:04] this a little bit today but you
[48:06] witnessed to a trinitarian and they say
[48:08] well what do you believe and you tell
[48:10] them Acts 2 38 establish it in this
[48:13] scripture and they say that's what I
[48:15] believe so look how slippery Satan is to
[48:18] give them the word he doesn't talk
[48:20] Matthew 28 19 out of the Bible he
[48:23] doesn't chop Acts 2 38 or acts 19. he
[48:26] doesn't take any of these out of the
[48:28] Bible he just puts a Twist to it that
[48:31] the people are not fully understanding
[48:33] or grasping and so this lawyer quotes
[48:36] the scripture correctly he interprets
[48:39] this as it were correctly but underlying
[48:41] motive or Spirit behind it is an
[48:44] entirely a different Spirit another
[48:46] spirit that is that is Anointed there
[48:49] and so you know in the human intellect
[48:52] we've seen this in the message my
[48:54] brother and sister people can put almost
[48:56] any twist they want to put on the
[48:58] message and they can use that and come
[49:00] back to the Bible come back to quotes of
[49:03] brother Branham and say well this is
[49:05] correct but my brother and sister what
[49:07] did Jesus say what does the word say not
[49:10] a Twist but just the pure unadulterated
[49:13] word and so it's there you know he
[49:17] speaks out and gets it perfectly correct
[49:19] and says you know answering me says thou
[49:22] shall love the Lord thy God with all thy
[49:24] heart with all thy soul and with all thy
[49:27] strength and with all thy mind and thy
[49:29] neighbor as thyself and so he was well
[49:32] versed
[49:34] in the scripture
[49:37] but he's standing there in a position
[49:41] that down in his heart
[49:43] there's something that he's trying to
[49:46] put a Twist on what is our neighbor
[49:49] who is our neighbor and this is what he
[49:52] comes back instead of just taking the
[49:54] word at face value
[49:57] you know I just read a quote
[49:59] of a man here years ago and somebody
[50:03] said hey you often you often say that
[50:07] um
[50:09] you will only tell the truth
[50:12] and he said yes that's what I say that's
[50:14] what I do and they said well what about
[50:17] if it's to your benefit or something and
[50:19] he says look if you just tell the truth
[50:23] you don't have to remember the story
[50:27] so we see now that Jesus is laid down to
[50:30] this lawyer
[50:32] a place
[50:33] not who do you lawyers say that I am
[50:37] but he took him back to the word because
[50:39] the word was there forever anchor
[50:44] the Torah was there forever angry it was
[50:48] what Moses said what Moses said what
[50:50] Moses said
[50:52] so Jesus doesn't say look there's a new
[50:55] promise there's a fulfillment of
[50:57] scripture here now he takes them back to
[51:00] the thing that they are anchored in they
[51:02] can tell that same story and he does and
[51:05] so he brings that out but it is there
[51:07] that he brings it in a way and being
[51:10] willing to to justify himself verse 29
[51:13] he says and who is my neighbor
[51:16] now if he was trying to understand my
[51:18] brother and sister he would he would be
[51:21] there saying okay I need some clarity I
[51:24] don't understand but as a religious man
[51:26] and a lawyer he knew what the word said
[51:30] and so he's trying to then get something
[51:33] out of Jesus that he himself actually
[51:36] knew what the answer so he's trying to
[51:38] justify himself now my brother and
[51:40] sister
[51:41] he's just not really trying to
[51:44] understand he's trying to find fault and
[51:45] I just want to deviate for one moment if
[51:48] you don't mind that's what's happening
[51:49] in the day that Spirit never died
[51:51] there's a lot of people wanting to
[51:53] justify themselves they're trying to
[51:56] find faults somewhere else that they
[51:58] themselves will feel good about their
[52:01] position but my brother and sister just
[52:03] like this lawyer if he's not in the word
[52:05] he's out of the word amen if he wasn't
[52:07] in the right Spirit then he's in the
[52:09] wrong spirit amen and we have those same
[52:12] things happening today that people are
[52:15] speaking they're very qualified they
[52:17] have abilities but they're coming and
[52:20] they underlying in their Spirit have a
[52:24] fault to find with something now this is
[52:26] going to be maybe a little different way
[52:28] to put it but you'll have a little mercy
[52:30] on me they're trying to find fault with
[52:34] something they can't live
[52:37] but I can't live it either
[52:41] but I know the one who lives
[52:44] amen and that is what it's all about
[52:46] it's not our claim on him it's his claim
[52:49] on us and that sets us in a position
[52:52] because I make mistakes daily as the
[52:55] prophet of God said we backslide daily
[52:58] amen and so it's in that position that
[53:01] the critic is trying to find fault with
[53:04] something that they themselves are not
[53:06] happy with they themselves cannot live
[53:09] or do not see the revelation of it so
[53:12] they're their finding fault because
[53:14] everything if you go back and study
[53:16] you'll find that everything that Jesus
[53:18] spoke publicly every recorded words that
[53:21] we have that Jesus spoke you can take it
[53:24] back in the Torah
[53:27] and find its foundation
[53:29] he never brought one false Doctrine
[53:32] never brought one false interpretation
[53:35] never brought as it were one personal
[53:37] revelation every one of those is
[53:40] anchored in the Old Testament as
[53:43] prophecy
[53:44] amen
[53:46] so it's there now let's just look right
[53:48] here in in uh verse 30.
[53:52] what does Jesus do he doesn't go back he
[53:55] doesn't contest he doesn't go back and
[53:57] say you have a misunderstanding or you
[53:59] have a lack of Revelation now that's a
[54:01] human element that we ought to learn and
[54:03] that is is when you deal with people who
[54:05] don't see it like you you don't need to
[54:07] come and put their face in the book and
[54:09] prove them wrong you need to just give
[54:11] them space and it is there that as my
[54:15] dad used to say you give the old cow
[54:17] enough rope she'll hang herself
[54:19] amen so you just set back to just let it
[54:22] go because if they have a correct Spirit
[54:26] then God will bring them around to that
[54:29] position and open their eyes but if the
[54:31] spirit is not correct then God's not
[54:34] going to give Revelation to them because
[54:36] they're still babes as the prophet of
[54:38] God talking about teaching algebra amen
[54:41] so you look at this and see how that God
[54:43] has come now and Jesus answered and says
[54:46] this is how it comes a certain man he
[54:49] went down Jerusalem Jericho and uh was
[54:52] fell among Thieves and and when you read
[54:54] that basically you kind of can turn that
[54:57] around and the thieves fell on him amen
[55:00] so he's there and
[55:03] um they they uh stripped him of his
[55:05] raiment and wounded him and departed
[55:07] leaving him half dead and so we'll look
[55:10] at this now and just imagine on the
[55:13] Jericho Road a road you have traveled
[55:15] many many times and now as a priest
[55:19] you're coming down down here and here is
[55:21] a man who is pardon me for putting it
[55:24] straight but here's a man who is
[55:26] virtually naked if not naked laying on
[55:28] the side of the road but bloodied and
[55:31] battered and um you know the priests had
[55:34] to purify themselves they had to go
[55:36] through time of cleansing they couldn't
[55:38] touch unclean things and they couldn't
[55:40] and no doubt this man is traveling and
[55:43] he looks at that and to himself see now
[55:46] the lawyer is trying to justify himself
[55:48] but let's just take this a little deeper
[55:50] here is the priest and he's walking down
[55:55] the Jericho Road and he sees this man
[55:57] instead of saying you know what let's
[56:00] help this man let me even if I can't do
[56:02] it myself let me run to the inn and find
[56:05] those that can help and carry this man
[56:08] back to Doctor him but instead he looks
[56:10] at the man and says you know what I I I
[56:12] he's kind of beneath us maybe he knew
[56:16] the man
[56:20] maybe he deserved that
[56:23] hasn't been faithful in church lately
[56:26] so whatever has come upon him
[56:29] probably deserves it
[56:31] see you have to look into the human mind
[56:34] how it would be and all of the things
[56:36] that it would go thousands of little
[56:39] tributaries that take it off to this
[56:41] must be the will of God or this is that
[56:43] or this man's beneath me or you know
[56:45] what I'm wearing my best garments and
[56:47] I've got an appointment down here at the
[56:49] Sanhedrin and I can't you know and
[56:51] everything but he justifies himself that
[56:54] a man human
[56:56] a part of humanity is laying there and
[56:58] he justifies it to himself
[57:01] to just leave them there
[57:03] and walk on
[57:07] and as he goes the scripture doesn't
[57:09] deal with this but I don't believe
[57:11] because we're humans and I don't know
[57:12] about you but a pretty visual person
[57:15] myself if I had walked by that man
[57:17] laying bloody on the side of the road I
[57:20] I would have had a hard time just
[57:22] dismissing that out of my mind
[57:24] and so it's there that this priest puts
[57:28] different reasons various reasons and
[57:30] moves on and goes about his way and goes
[57:33] about his day and so it's there as it
[57:35] comes down so this priest has been a
[57:39] gone he's outside uh you know beyond
[57:41] site and likewise a Levi very much the
[57:45] same position as the priest the very
[57:48] religious of the day these were the
[57:52] god-called in of the day now my brother
[57:55] and sister the prophet of God talks
[57:57] about how we end up with women preachers
[57:59] can we remember exactly what brother
[58:01] Brown laid as a foundation of why the
[58:03] woman preacher raised up my brother and
[58:05] sister your brother Branham says they
[58:07] raised up because the men wouldn't do
[58:09] their job
[58:10] and so we'll look at the world we live
[58:12] in today how these Spirits have never
[58:15] changed and it's there that we'll find
[58:17] that these things are usually a result
[58:19] my brother and sister you can study
[58:22] history if you care to you study World
[58:25] War II and uh the the issues that happen
[58:29] prophet of God says the issues that
[58:31] happened in Russia were caused by the
[58:34] Catholic Church
[58:35] they turned to follow says I mean to
[58:38] communism because Catholicism failed
[58:41] them
[58:43] now there's not a sermon about
[58:45] Catholicism but but you see there's a
[58:47] there's always a something that brings
[58:50] about a result there's always something
[58:53] that is what I can't even think that
[58:55] it's right on the edge of my mind cause
[58:57] and effect
[58:59] cause and effect
[59:01] so now we have a levite also a very
[59:03] religious man also a man to go in and
[59:06] out of the temple has to be purified and
[59:09] they got up every day and there was
[59:10] ritual that they followed to meet their
[59:13] own imposed code of worship and so
[59:17] they're going now and he sees him and
[59:19] this is something that I find my brother
[59:21] and sister that is more remarkable if I
[59:24] could just depict this to you you know
[59:26] they are over by the piano is uh this
[59:29] this poor man who's been robbed and
[59:31] beaten and the priest he just moves over
[59:34] here on the left hand shoulder of the
[59:37] road and he doesn't even bother and he
[59:39] just keeps right on going but here it is
[59:42] the priest is caught in a little
[59:44] different anointing and he is there he
[59:47] sees the man he goes over he even stops
[59:50] and looks at the man and says yep pretty
[59:54] bad he's been robbed and he's been
[59:56] beaten yep that's too bad and then he
[59:59] goes back over and goes on down the road
[1:00:02] and there he is justifying to himself
[1:00:05] his response now my brother and sister
[1:00:08] you look at that and and we've seen the
[1:00:10] the failure you might say of ministry
[1:00:13] amen and I'm just going to be real blunt
[1:00:15] tonight people today are saying We only
[1:00:18] listen to tapes because the ministry has
[1:00:20] failed us well I'm here to tell you the
[1:00:22] word of God says there is faithful
[1:00:24] Ministry that will be on the scene at
[1:00:27] the coming of the Lord that's there for
[1:00:29] the perfecting of the Saints and I'm not
[1:00:31] doing this to lift up the preacher I'm
[1:00:33] here speaking this tonight to tell you
[1:00:36] that word of God will come to pass it
[1:00:39] isn't about me or Chris or Brother David
[1:00:42] or anyone else my brother and sister
[1:00:44] it's about the word coming to pass and
[1:00:47] if I can't count on that word of God
[1:00:49] coming to pass then what else can I not
[1:00:52] count on so I believe that in its
[1:00:55] entirety but yet we have these examples
[1:00:57] of these men that for whatever reason in
[1:01:00] the finery of their life they're not
[1:01:02] willing to touch this bloody and beaten
[1:01:04] man but look at this now a certain
[1:01:07] Samaritan as he Journey he come where he
[1:01:10] was and when he saw him he had
[1:01:13] compassion the first thing that touched
[1:01:15] his heart and I'm not going to go into
[1:01:16] it tonight of how I come across this
[1:01:18] thought but God just dealing with me of
[1:01:21] a circumstance amen and you look at that
[1:01:23] what happened this Samaritan now what is
[1:01:25] a Samaritan he was a Jew and a gentile
[1:01:28] cross oftentimes connected into pagan
[1:01:33] or ungodly worship
[1:01:36] everyone looked down on Samaritans they
[1:01:39] even accused Jesus of being a Samaritan
[1:01:41] because they were using that as a slur
[1:01:45] right
[1:01:47] but we'll find that God
[1:01:49] had called someone out of every nation
[1:01:52] Kindred and tongue
[1:01:54] I don't care how bad they have a
[1:01:57] reputation and how bad they have a
[1:01:59] reputation God called them they will
[1:02:03] respond
[1:02:05] amen because this word will come to pass
[1:02:08] now this certain man that regardless of
[1:02:12] wealth history will tell you that they
[1:02:14] were rich and poor they were of
[1:02:17] influence and unknown
[1:02:20] and still looked down on
[1:02:23] but the Samaritans themselves were a
[1:02:25] little bit prejudiced or racist or
[1:02:27] however you want to put it because the
[1:02:29] Samaritans themselves held certain books
[1:02:32] of the writings of Moses and it was
[1:02:34] there that they believed they had a
[1:02:36] finer or more accurate form of worship
[1:02:39] than the rest of the Jews did and so
[1:02:42] they themselves had their own words that
[1:02:45] they blasted back their own attitudes
[1:02:48] that they blasted back their own
[1:02:50] pushback on this and we'll find there
[1:02:52] that amongst them they had their
[1:02:55] ultra-religious and religious and
[1:02:57] zealots and whatever else amongst the
[1:02:59] the Samaritans and many of them said
[1:03:02] because we are the keepers of these
[1:03:05] books of the Torah of books of Moses
[1:03:08] that we actually have more Revelation
[1:03:10] look how this goes back and forth we've
[1:03:13] got more Revelation than the common old
[1:03:16] Jews over there do amen they just abused
[1:03:19] the law of Moses right and left and
[1:03:21] we've got the books we're the keeper of
[1:03:23] these books and we have the pure word
[1:03:25] for our day and yet they still have some
[1:03:28] muddy water over here to deal with and
[1:03:31] some things that they didn't have lined
[1:03:33] up either amen but look how God is using
[1:03:36] this now when we take that and the
[1:03:38] reason I brought that point out is
[1:03:40] you'll find that these Samaritans by and
[1:03:42] large were religious people
[1:03:47] and some had the truth
[1:03:52] I'm sorry how religious we are has
[1:03:54] nothing to do with it it's whether we
[1:03:56] have the truth or not
[1:03:58] amen
[1:03:59] so you look at this scene now this
[1:04:01] Samaritan
[1:04:02] he sees this man and
[1:04:05] he sees where he was and what does he do
[1:04:07] he might have traveled
[1:04:09] I'm just going to put it this way just
[1:04:11] be kind to me tonight the sidewalk was
[1:04:13] on this side of the road
[1:04:15] and he got off the sidewalk just like
[1:04:19] the levite only when he got over there
[1:04:22] his heart went out and he said you know
[1:04:24] what
[1:04:25] someone
[1:04:27] I don't know they might all been visual
[1:04:29] to each other
[1:04:31] the Samaritan might have seen the priest
[1:04:33] he might have seen the Levi
[1:04:36] and he might have thought mine they they
[1:04:39] should have helped this man
[1:04:42] and so as Jesus is talking to this
[1:04:44] lawyer he lays this story out
[1:04:50] and then he asked the question and he
[1:04:52] drops the balm you might say on them
[1:04:55] which one of these my words here which
[1:04:57] one of these is more spiritual
[1:05:01] and the lawyer himself had enough
[1:05:03] character and understanding
[1:05:05] to say hmm the one that actually helped
[1:05:10] the one that actually had compassion
[1:05:14] now we look at this and realize my
[1:05:16] brother and sister that every one of
[1:05:18] these had an equal opportunity but this
[1:05:21] my brother and sister was a place in a
[1:05:24] situation
[1:05:26] that I want to just bring and loop this
[1:05:28] back around to you tonight for a few
[1:05:30] minutes this was three classes of people
[1:05:34] the ultra religious
[1:05:36] the religious
[1:05:39] and a man that according to scripture
[1:05:41] made no claim at all
[1:05:47] he was just there a Samaritan
[1:05:51] now I hope this is not offensive
[1:05:54] in my short life
[1:05:57] I've dealt with all kinds of people
[1:06:01] I've been in meetings before where
[1:06:03] people would say how long has your
[1:06:04] family been in the message
[1:06:07] well my parents come in the message in
[1:06:09] 1970 or so
[1:06:12] oh long time long time why don't you ask
[1:06:14] me how long I've been in the message or
[1:06:17] that's even irrelevant how long has the
[1:06:20] message been in me
[1:06:24] but people judge that another one I've
[1:06:26] experienced through the years to be in
[1:06:28] meetings I marry it very very well to be
[1:06:31] there enjoying fellowship with this
[1:06:33] brother gentleman and finally goes well
[1:06:36] who's your pastor and I said well you
[1:06:39] know what there's been all this
[1:06:40] circumstance all this stuff and I don't
[1:06:42] want to explain it but we don't have a
[1:06:43] pastor right now and I am not
[1:06:45] exaggerating as I hold the conversation
[1:06:47] with this man and I said we don't have a
[1:06:49] pastor right now he just turns and walks
[1:06:50] off
[1:06:52] not having a pastor obviously took me
[1:06:55] out of the message
[1:06:57] not having a pastor obviously took me
[1:06:59] out of the will of God
[1:07:04] hmm
[1:07:07] and speaking of having pastors I've been
[1:07:10] with people
[1:07:12] who have said
[1:07:14] if your church ain't growing
[1:07:16] like exponentially
[1:07:19] the words not being preached
[1:07:22] but the prophet of God said our churches
[1:07:24] will probably get smaller
[1:07:26] not bigger
[1:07:28] so we have classes of people and how
[1:07:30] they approach this and how they look at
[1:07:32] the people we also have to deal with
[1:07:34] people who are judgmental over
[1:07:36] everything but their own opinion
[1:07:38] and so it's in that realm that God deals
[1:07:41] with this and so here it is uh Jesus is
[1:07:45] taking away from this lawyer his
[1:07:47] argument of dealing with these things
[1:07:49] and you know it we have to come and and
[1:07:53] look at this and why is it that God
[1:07:55] chooses the Samaritan well I can't
[1:07:57] answer that but in the
[1:08:00] um
[1:08:04] in the seven Church ages simonian Church
[1:08:07] age here
[1:08:09] um
[1:08:15] you see here he says you see the one
[1:08:17] difference between Israel and the rest
[1:08:19] of the Nations was God
[1:08:22] put God to one side and Israel was like
[1:08:25] any other nation and let me put this
[1:08:27] right here my brother and sister put God
[1:08:29] to the side and Grace Tabernacles like
[1:08:32] any other Church
[1:08:35] when Samson cut off his hair he was like
[1:08:37] any other man put the leadership of the
[1:08:40] Holy Ghost Assad and the church is
[1:08:43] nothing but the world with God's name
[1:08:45] attached to it
[1:08:47] hmm so it don't matter what title or
[1:08:49] position that we possess we have one
[1:08:52] connection and that is to have not only
[1:08:55] his name but to have his Spirit and the
[1:08:59] life
[1:09:00] amen otherwise we end up being a church
[1:09:03] just like the world the world and the
[1:09:05] church are all of the same lump just
[1:09:07] like Jacob and Esau were of the same
[1:09:09] parents but the spirit of God makes a
[1:09:12] difference it doesn't matter if you call
[1:09:14] yourself a Christian
[1:09:16] anyone can do that the point is whether
[1:09:19] or not you have the spirit of God in you
[1:09:22] for what without that Spirit you are
[1:09:24] reprobate and you are none of his and so
[1:09:28] I hope you're catching my connection
[1:09:29] right here we got a priest we've got a
[1:09:32] Levine but they had not one bit of
[1:09:34] compassion for this man there in fact he
[1:09:37] was beneath them but we have a man that
[1:09:39] we don't see an identity spiritually and
[1:09:42] he had something I'm going to believe
[1:09:44] that he was a Believer there was
[1:09:46] something in him that says it is my
[1:09:48] almost my my obligation as it were not
[1:09:52] just helping the man I wanted to kind of
[1:09:54] separate that tonight it's not just
[1:09:56] about oh I must help this man but there
[1:09:59] was something down in inside of him that
[1:10:01] says I am obligated as it were to
[1:10:05] express the Life of Christ to express
[1:10:08] the life of my God and His Spirit coming
[1:10:12] through me has to produce the word in
[1:10:15] flesh manifested amen otherwise we can
[1:10:18] just talk about it we don't need
[1:10:20] anything but just talk about it we can
[1:10:22] tell the story just talk about it but
[1:10:25] there has to be a life and my is there a
[1:10:28] lot of quotes that go with this but
[1:10:29] there has to be a life manifested and it
[1:10:33] starts with the spirit amen
[1:10:35] I hope I'm not
[1:10:37] baffling you with my my words
[1:10:40] amen now the likely
[1:10:43] we'll share this scripture in just a
[1:10:45] second but the likely does not mean they
[1:10:49] will
[1:10:51] and the unlikely does not mean they
[1:10:54] won't
[1:10:55] and we'll back that up with Matthew
[1:10:58] 21
[1:11:00] and we see this little story this little
[1:11:02] Parable here but what think ye a certain
[1:11:05] man had two sons and he came to the
[1:11:07] first and said Son go work today in my
[1:11:10] Vineyard and he answered and said I will
[1:11:13] not but afterward he repented and went
[1:11:16] and he came to the second and said
[1:11:19] likewise and he answered and said I go
[1:11:22] sir and went not wither of them Twain
[1:11:25] did the will of his father they say unto
[1:11:28] him the first Jesus saith unto them
[1:11:30] verily I say unto you that the publicans
[1:11:33] and the harlots go into the kingdom of
[1:11:35] God before you boy that was a hard
[1:11:38] statement I'm sure they were not the
[1:11:40] least bit happy with his words to tell
[1:11:42] them because they were there and they
[1:11:45] put up all this bold front they put up
[1:11:48] all this face about we are doing the
[1:11:50] will of God and I hope you catch it
[1:11:53] tonight amen I almost wish we weren't on
[1:11:55] the internet my brother and sister I
[1:11:57] want you to catch tonight there's been
[1:11:58] times that we have come and God wanting
[1:12:02] us to do something and we just held on
[1:12:04] drug our feet almost chained ourselves
[1:12:07] to the mast
[1:12:08] yeah
[1:12:10] but then God would deal with us and we'd
[1:12:12] realize
[1:12:14] I need to
[1:12:16] I should
[1:12:17] and we respond to God's call in our life
[1:12:23] and then
[1:12:26] we see the scripture here some are like
[1:12:29] gonna do it
[1:12:31] and they don't
[1:12:34] Lord help us
[1:12:36] I personally think this applies to every
[1:12:39] single one of us
[1:12:41] in the correct context
[1:12:43] of the times
[1:12:45] you know you get a bunch of preachers
[1:12:46] together I like to style these
[1:12:49] conversations because it gets awkward
[1:12:50] but you get a bunch of preachers
[1:12:52] together and we've quit preaching so
[1:12:54] many times we'd feel the encyclopedia
[1:12:56] clear what what is Paul's story I have
[1:12:59] quit preaching at least 10 million times
[1:13:03] but then God stirs you and you go this
[1:13:05] is what God called me to do I've got to
[1:13:08] do this
[1:13:09] and we all have this we've all got down
[1:13:12] in our our little dark valleys you know
[1:13:14] what I mean brother Trevor we're down
[1:13:15] there and the trees are so thick and the
[1:13:17] brush is so thick and we're just like
[1:13:19] I'll never make it back on the mountain
[1:13:21] I'm just quitting but then you sit down
[1:13:23] and something starts to Echo I'm not a
[1:13:26] quitter
[1:13:27] what is that God stirring us and we get
[1:13:29] up and we Press On
[1:13:31] so it is that we see now Jesus speaking
[1:13:34] to the lawyer
[1:13:36] and he's making a case
[1:13:40] does Jesus directly rebuke him
[1:13:44] tell him he's wrong tell him that he's
[1:13:46] off the word no he doesn't but what he
[1:13:49] does is he lays the story out
[1:13:52] and the words and the actions and the
[1:13:56] anointing on the man actually speaks in
[1:13:58] a fashion that no man's words could
[1:14:01] affect him as much as that as amen so
[1:14:04] it's there that it was not uh the office
[1:14:08] that they held it wasn't an outer
[1:14:10] identity my brother and sister that
[1:14:13] hindered either the priest or uh the uh
[1:14:18] um
[1:14:19] um um
[1:14:21] levite
[1:14:24] I was going to say the priest and the
[1:14:26] evangelist
[1:14:29] it wasn't the office they held and it
[1:14:32] wasn't an outward identity my brother
[1:14:34] and sister like my fine robes I might
[1:14:36] get them dirt it was something down
[1:14:37] inside
[1:14:38] it was something inside of them that
[1:14:41] actually hindered them from fulfilling
[1:14:44] the very words that the lawyer is
[1:14:48] quoting
[1:14:50] and the lawyer knows
[1:14:52] that he wouldn't
[1:14:54] have helped not man either
[1:15:00] I still to this day Marvel and wonder
[1:15:02] what did Jesus write
[1:15:04] in the dirt
[1:15:07] he wrote something powerful my brother
[1:15:09] and sister
[1:15:11] now I don't want to scrutinize that too
[1:15:13] much because God uses his word that he's
[1:15:16] riding on the tables of our hearts to do
[1:15:19] the exact same thing in our life
[1:15:23] the word he's writing on us
[1:15:26] is causing the same effect only we don't
[1:15:29] leave the word
[1:15:31] we repent
[1:15:33] but it's the same effect he's writing
[1:15:35] amen right there imagine fleshly table
[1:15:38] of our heart he's writing the word and
[1:15:41] we have that those feelings those times
[1:15:43] those things we look now and we say oh
[1:15:45] my that's me
[1:15:49] but what the difference is is that we as
[1:15:51] Sons and Daughters of God repent
[1:15:54] we don't turn and walk away in our sin
[1:15:56] and our unbelief amen
[1:15:59] so I think I say that brother Trevor
[1:16:01] amen praise the Lord because otherwise
[1:16:04] we just have a whole encyclopedia full
[1:16:06] of un dealt with issues in our life but
[1:16:09] God says nope nope so it is an issue of
[1:16:13] the heart amen it's not the identity but
[1:16:17] it's the heart and so it's their correct
[1:16:19] uh you know possessing the correct
[1:16:21] nature
[1:16:23] is much more important than we
[1:16:25] oftentimes really emphasize not right
[1:16:29] nature to have a Meek and a humble and
[1:16:31] contrite spirit to to not be lifted up
[1:16:34] not beheading not high-minded but to
[1:16:37] catch that and we'll look here and see
[1:16:40] in these that it's the actions that
[1:16:42] spoke very loud the identity on the
[1:16:46] Samaritan is nothing more than his
[1:16:48] ethnic identity
[1:16:50] it doesn't speak of office it doesn't
[1:16:52] speak a physician it doesn't speak of
[1:16:54] rich or poor it doesn't speak of
[1:16:56] anything else a realm of influence it
[1:16:58] just speaks and that's who he was but
[1:17:00] there was something in that man that he
[1:17:03] looked and saw that amen so what is
[1:17:05] Jesus doing he gives a word test to the
[1:17:08] lawyer and he's speaking my brother and
[1:17:12] sister of something that took place on
[1:17:14] the highway and not even a direct
[1:17:16] influence to this man but the whole
[1:17:20] Revelation or hidden meaning or story is
[1:17:24] very plain to the man and it's there
[1:17:27] that he realizes he himself while trying
[1:17:29] to trap is trapped
[1:17:32] and then I thank God for that amen that
[1:17:34] when the devil would like to trap us God
[1:17:37] comes around and springs that back where
[1:17:40] the word comes and puts the devil right
[1:17:43] back in his place
[1:17:44] amen where he cannot come and have free
[1:17:47] reign to throw out doubts and
[1:17:50] accusations he doesn't have free reign
[1:17:52] to be the accuser of the brother he's
[1:17:54] been put back in his place and he can
[1:17:57] still accuse but we can say it's under
[1:17:59] the blood it's not held to my account
[1:18:01] it's under the blood I've been forgiven
[1:18:04] it's in the sea of God's forgetfulness
[1:18:06] and the devil keeps coming and we just
[1:18:08] say that devil forget it hey you've been
[1:18:10] put back in your place we know who you
[1:18:14] are
[1:18:15] amen
[1:18:17] Hallelujah
[1:18:19] the answer
[1:18:22] was in the word
[1:18:24] and my brother and sister I'm coming I
[1:18:26] hope you don't mind I express it this
[1:18:28] way but I'm coming to be just a little
[1:18:30] short on people with all kinds of
[1:18:33] nonsense around the message because they
[1:18:35] have ideas my brother and sister we're
[1:18:37] message Believers are we not amen and we
[1:18:41] believe the Bible is our absolute so if
[1:18:43] it's in the Bible and God has given us a
[1:18:46] message let's take it back to the Bible
[1:18:48] run it through the filter and take it
[1:18:50] back to the word the message of the hour
[1:18:52] which is the word expressed in our day
[1:18:55] and live it do what the prophet said
[1:18:58] people are like well can we do this and
[1:19:00] can we do that and is this okay what
[1:19:03] does the word say what does a message
[1:19:05] say Amen if we want to compare to
[1:19:08] another religion let's go read their
[1:19:10] manual
[1:19:11] but we have a manual my brother and
[1:19:13] sister and it's right here and it's
[1:19:15] called the Bible amen and I I guess I'm
[1:19:18] getting a little short with people
[1:19:19] saying well you know now I've seen a
[1:19:22] picture
[1:19:23] I've seen a picture of brother branham's
[1:19:25] daughters and and their skirts were
[1:19:27] above their knee
[1:19:32] so you saw a picture
[1:19:37] what did the word say
[1:19:40] what was the painting
[1:19:44] that was painted for us
[1:19:47] now I just grabbed that as an example
[1:19:49] right but people are like off of a
[1:19:51] picture of brother Brown's daughters
[1:19:54] they're going to change their whole
[1:19:55] dress code
[1:19:58] believing they can justify
[1:20:00] their position
[1:20:02] by a picture
[1:20:06] and brother Brown let his daughters do
[1:20:08] that
[1:20:10] I'm just going to go out Lulu land you
[1:20:12] guys might just throw me out with the
[1:20:14] bathwater tonight
[1:20:16] we wouldn't have a clue that maybe three
[1:20:18] minutes five minutes 30 seconds before
[1:20:21] that
[1:20:22] brother Branham might have turned to his
[1:20:24] daughters and said Becky
[1:20:26] that skirt is too short
[1:20:30] or as the one picture Sarah
[1:20:34] it's not really appropriate
[1:20:37] Well we'd be 30 40 years later see
[1:20:40] see
[1:20:42] that's how I'm going to live like that
[1:20:44] right there see
[1:20:46] don't know that the prophet of God said
[1:20:48] you ought not be out here like that
[1:20:52] so what are we going to do now
[1:20:54] my brother and sister I can tell you
[1:20:56] there's churches where if we hiccuped
[1:20:59] the Deacon would probably drag you out
[1:21:01] give you a tongue lashing
[1:21:04] and I've been in churches that they
[1:21:06] practically and the message have moved
[1:21:07] to coffee and donuts in the sanctuary
[1:21:11] which into this are we going to go to
[1:21:14] we're message believers we're going to
[1:21:17] the word
[1:21:18] and that's our absolute right there in
[1:21:23] the word
[1:21:24] because I don't know where they're going
[1:21:27] and I don't know where they're going but
[1:21:29] just like Jesus spoke to this lawyer and
[1:21:32] said if you do this you live
[1:21:35] he didn't compromise on that he said you
[1:21:38] this is where it's at and you do it and
[1:21:40] if you're obedient to that you live
[1:21:44] oh my I hope this making sense to you
[1:21:47] amen what was it the answer was in the
[1:21:49] word Satan had the question my brother
[1:21:52] and sister but the word held the answer
[1:21:54] amen and in our day we have the answer
[1:21:57] to the devil's question the devil's out
[1:21:59] here going this way and going that way
[1:22:01] trying to read you find what a message
[1:22:03] believer is my brother and sister
[1:22:06] there's no redefining we believe this it
[1:22:09] is our absolute amen and this is what we
[1:22:13] are encountering on our road amen down
[1:22:16] to Jericho we're meeting thieves and
[1:22:19] we're meeting the spirit of the lawyer
[1:22:21] and we're meeting the real believer that
[1:22:24] has something in his heart where the
[1:22:26] word means something the life means
[1:22:28] something and we're going to encounter
[1:22:30] each and every one of those on this
[1:22:32] journey
[1:22:34] now what are we going to do the
[1:22:36] scripture says that we would not be of
[1:22:39] those that are tossed to and fro on
[1:22:42] every wind of Doctrine but we're
[1:22:45] anchored and this is my this is my life
[1:22:48] this is my faith this is who I am and
[1:22:51] we're anchored into that position
[1:22:53] because the road to Jericho has been
[1:22:56] proven by scripture not to be a very
[1:22:59] good road not a not a healthy road not a
[1:23:01] a good thing that's always going to
[1:23:03] happen my brother and sister
[1:23:05] the cares of life
[1:23:07] the careless of life
[1:23:11] those who could care less about your
[1:23:14] life
[1:23:15] are going to all be found on the Jericho
[1:23:18] Road
[1:23:21] now
[1:23:24] having preached this and there are
[1:23:26] several different thoughts and like I
[1:23:27] shared with you not going tonight but
[1:23:29] Lord dealing with me along this line
[1:23:33] I want you to understand tonight this is
[1:23:36] not about
[1:23:38] not helping
[1:23:40] or helping
[1:23:45] it's about the following of the
[1:23:46] leadership of the Holy Spirit right
[1:23:50] you say but we should
[1:23:52] Jesus said the poor will be with you
[1:23:53] always
[1:23:55] so we can't go fix the problem of every
[1:23:57] poor person out here
[1:24:00] you know you realize years ago just a
[1:24:03] tad bit of world history if you don't
[1:24:04] mind for a second
[1:24:06] you realize after World War II
[1:24:09] men like Eisenhower had a dream when
[1:24:11] they saw the dire poverty and starvation
[1:24:15] of Europe after World War II
[1:24:18] and they took a position that we have to
[1:24:22] raise this was part of the creation of
[1:24:24] the World Bank in their eyes we realized
[1:24:27] that it had a greater fulfillment but in
[1:24:30] their eyes they said we are going to
[1:24:31] make a concerted effort to raise
[1:24:34] the economy of the world that there
[1:24:37] would be no third world
[1:24:41] sounds good doesn't it
[1:24:44] if you've lived or traveled or passed
[1:24:47] through third world
[1:24:49] you realize third world can be really
[1:24:51] far down there they never they chose
[1:24:53] never to go beyond third world but I'm
[1:24:55] telling you
[1:24:56] I've been in places that would be fourth
[1:24:58] or fifth
[1:25:02] and then they realize they can't bring
[1:25:05] all of them up
[1:25:08] and they turned around and said for
[1:25:10] equality isn't that amazing that that is
[1:25:12] something that's come up now
[1:25:14] for equality's sake we're going to take
[1:25:16] everybody
[1:25:17] down to their level
[1:25:20] except for us that are the brains
[1:25:23] and of course we deserve better
[1:25:27] now you say what's this tie-in brother
[1:25:29] Paul
[1:25:31] a priest went by he has a good life
[1:25:34] that Levi went by had a good life
[1:25:37] we don't know what this man who was
[1:25:39] robbed on the side of the road what his
[1:25:41] life was
[1:25:43] but it obviously was beneath them in
[1:25:46] their mind
[1:25:47] and the Samaritans said I don't care
[1:25:49] your status
[1:25:53] I care for you
[1:25:55] right
[1:25:56] and that's the Gospel of Jesus Christ
[1:26:01] rich
[1:26:03] poor
[1:26:05] don't care about that
[1:26:07] care about you
[1:26:10] and your position has nothing to do with
[1:26:14] this position
[1:26:15] but it's our position and Jesus Christ
[1:26:18] amen and let us oh my I can just go on
[1:26:22] and on about this I'm sorry but the
[1:26:24] prophet of God just talking about how we
[1:26:26] should treat one another amen and he
[1:26:29] said that that sister and that Silk gown
[1:26:31] I think it was you know she's over here
[1:26:34] hugging the sister and The Gingham
[1:26:36] and the brother in The Tuxedo the fine
[1:26:39] suit is over here with his arms wrapped
[1:26:41] around a brother in the overalls
[1:26:44] their connection is brother
[1:26:47] nothing to do with the position
[1:26:49] in that but our position in Jesus Christ
[1:26:52] amen amen that's the testimony
[1:26:56] that we're going to leave on the Jericho
[1:26:59] Road
[1:27:00] that we love one another and we love the
[1:27:02] Lord and we will do what we can to help
[1:27:04] it and I was going back to this and you
[1:27:07] say well we we need to try and help
[1:27:09] everybody we come across we have to find
[1:27:11] a balance my brother and sister the
[1:27:12] leadership of the Holy Ghost because
[1:27:14] you'll find that Jesus passed many
[1:27:17] of multitudes at the pool of Bethesda
[1:27:21] and touched one life
[1:27:25] how do we explain that
[1:27:29] because in the multitudes the word of
[1:27:31] God shows us a small number
[1:27:34] is willing to receive
[1:27:37] eternal life
[1:27:39] now I heard it by a minister this way in
[1:27:42] closing
[1:27:46] if you offer eternal life to everyone
[1:27:50] they're going to say I want it
[1:27:54] when you show them the price tag
[1:27:59] very few say I'm willing to pay
[1:28:04] but I can't pay
[1:28:06] and you can't pay
[1:28:08] when we say I'm willing to pay we're
[1:28:10] actually giving our Lord Jesus Christ
[1:28:12] permission
[1:28:14] to pay our debt for us
[1:28:18] isn't that wonderful
[1:28:20] and I can give you a natural side of
[1:28:22] that it wasn't me it was actually the
[1:28:24] church but many years ago
[1:28:26] there was a need and we went to help
[1:28:29] this family pay this need
[1:28:33] and the company wouldn't receive money
[1:28:34] from us
[1:28:37] they said you have to have their
[1:28:40] permission
[1:28:42] to pay their debt and that's always
[1:28:45] struck with me our lord Jesus didn't
[1:28:47] come along and say I'm going to redeem
[1:28:49] you whether you like it or not
[1:28:52] he come and anointed us to come to a
[1:28:54] place that we'd say Lord
[1:28:58] if you could just pay my debt
[1:29:00] I can't pay it it's too large
[1:29:03] I need you we're giving him permission
[1:29:06] and I I close with this sister vika
[1:29:09] please I close with this right here the
[1:29:12] prophet of God showed us clearly
[1:29:14] that the Holy Spirit was a gentleman
[1:29:20] he doesn't Force anything
[1:29:23] but may we have the spirit of the
[1:29:27] Samaritan
[1:29:28] in our journey
[1:29:31] on the Jericho Road
[1:29:33] anoint us Lord day by day to know when
[1:29:37] and where and how
[1:29:41] then
[1:29:44] we'll know who our neighbor is
[1:29:48] not because we have revelation of our
[1:29:50] neighbor
[1:29:51] but because God revealed to us
[1:29:56] amen
[1:29:57] I have part two and three already in my
[1:30:00] brain here but I'll just stop right here
[1:30:02] at this thought
[1:30:04] this all come down to Saints
[1:30:08] the leadership
[1:30:10] of the Holy Spirit
[1:30:17] I've given money to people through the
[1:30:19] years
[1:30:21] only to see them spend it in every way
[1:30:25] but what they promised to spend it
[1:30:28] [Music]
[1:30:31] I have given money
[1:30:33] to people
[1:30:34] and had them come years later and say
[1:30:36] thank you it made such a difference in
[1:30:38] our life
[1:30:40] [Music]
[1:30:42] how come I didn't know the difference
[1:30:44] [Music]
[1:30:47] I couldn't have told you which one would
[1:30:49] have been responsible
[1:30:53] I don't want to give up on giving
[1:30:55] but we come to a a place where we
[1:31:00] realize
[1:31:01] just as Jesus
[1:31:04] weave this way through all the
[1:31:06] multitudes
[1:31:08] at the pool
[1:31:11] and stopped
[1:31:13] one man
[1:31:16] Lord I need that kind of divine
[1:31:19] leadership in my life I need that kind
[1:31:22] of leadership to know what to do when
[1:31:25] and where and how because you see the
[1:31:29] road to Jericho
[1:31:31] from Jerusalem
[1:31:33] it's quite a few miles
[1:31:36] there's mountains
[1:31:38] there's goalies and ravines
[1:31:41] brush
[1:31:43] and it's hot and it's dry
[1:31:46] and we get weary on that road to Jericho
[1:31:52] but it was a road
[1:31:54] it wasn't a dead end to the Wilderness
[1:31:57] it was a road
[1:31:59] there's a reason God called us on that
[1:32:01] road and there's a reason we're
[1:32:03] traveling the road so there must be a
[1:32:05] reason we're supposed to be there
[1:32:07] Lord help us on this road to Jericho
[1:32:11] Hallelujah God bless you tonight Saints
[1:32:13] I know this is a little bit different I
[1:32:16] felt different even as I studied it but
[1:32:18] I felt like I needed to share this amen
[1:32:22] because you see my brother and sister
[1:32:25] we're gonna pass a lot of people on the
[1:32:27] Jericho Road
[1:32:28] and God wants you to help some and some
[1:32:30] he just wants you to pray for and move
[1:32:32] on just like the prophet of God said you
[1:32:35] need that discernment of the Holy Spirit
[1:32:36] we're over here praying for someone
[1:32:38] that's in a condition and we're trying
[1:32:40] to pray off something God has put on
[1:32:43] their life and all we're doing is
[1:32:46] confusing the plan of God Lord give us
[1:32:48] wisdom on how to deal with those we meet
[1:32:53] on the Jericho Road a man let's stand
[1:32:56] and just sing a song or two before we're
