We just this morning just want to remember all of those who are not able to be here with us today. Um the Lord knows their hearts and we certainly believe that they have a desire to be here. Amen. Um just a few things we want to remember. Uh, one I don't I don't think it's a secret, but we're looking forward to Brother Persant and Sister Koncha being here with us for Christmas time. So, that'll be wonderful to see them to be able to meet. I think Sister Carrie, you're the only one that's met Isaac. Yeah, man. What a privilege. Amen. But they'll be coming and and it'll be a wonderful time to see them in person again. And we want to remember our sister Rachel. Um the due date uh is coming up very soon and we want to lift her and the baby up in prayer. Just want to have mom and baby to be healthy and and strong and be able. I remember a brother one time made a statement to me. He said um I don't know and I'm not making a doctrine of this but possibly could it be the church is just going to grow from within. And um however the Lord chooses to grow the church, we say thank you, Lord. So just lift Sister Rachel up in prayer. Now, this is a part that's going to be a little shocking to someone. Uh but they'll get over it in time. Uh Sister Melody uh feels led of the Lord to move to Ohio and um we haven't been able to change her mind. We've made threats. We've tried small forms of bribery. Uh but none of that has changed her mind. And so we definitely want to lift our sister Melody up in prayer for this major change or move in her life. And we're actually going to invite her to come up this morning. I know she's still going to be here on Wednesday night, but uh we're just going to uh just ask some of the brothers to come up. We're going to lay our hands on Sister Melody. No, we're not trying to change her mind. Amen. We just want to just ask the Lord to give her traveling mercies and uh be with her. She needs to She's got short-term plans, but she needs a place to live. She needs a good job. Amen. It's not just to have a job, but she needs a good job. And we want the Lord as as uh she is following the leadership of the Lord. We just want the Lord to pour his blessings out upon her uh that the way would be smooth as the scripture said, he would make the rough places smooth before us. And so, amen. Brothers, would you just come and let's lay hands on our sister Melody. And um I love my niece very very much. Um she's very special girl to me. And uh it's in that that I am actually heartbroken that she feels led to move. I'm I'm thinking. But you see what we know is that sometimes we need to make a shift so we can have spiritual growth. Sometimes the Lord's just asking us to take a step a little further, a step of trust. &gt;&gt; And so we want to commit this time a travel mercies future of my dear niece uh to the Lord that the Lord would just bless her. He's done such incredible things. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; Excuse me while I cry a little bit. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; He has answered our prayers. &gt;&gt; Amen. We see this and I believe he'll continue to answer our prayers. Amen. &gt;&gt; Heavenly Father, Lord, we come before you this morning with thanksgiving in our hearts. Lord, sorrow and joy at the same time, Lord. Father, the joy, Lord, to see you doing this mighty work in Sister Melody's life. Lord, how you've come. You've proven yourself to her again and again and again. Now Lord, we're believing Father that as you are guiding her on this journey, Lord, you will make the way smooth before us, Father, traveling mercies, Lord, as she travels to Ohio, Lord, that you would just bless her with a good job, a good place to live, Lord, that there would be those saints that would become her cherished friends, that they would be encouraers, mentors, father, friends like no other. Lord, we would just ask for your hand of mercy upon her. And Lord, as she would be there, Father, let the ministry just touch her life, Father, that spiritual growth would just come abundantly, it would be poured out abundantly in her life, Father. Lord, as you draw her close, Father, we thank you, Father. Lord, that she recognizes and is standing solid as a daughter of God. May the word just come and the promises of your word be fulfilled in her life, Lord. Bless her steps, Father. Bless the work of her hands, Lord. Bless her praise, Father, as it comes to the throne, Lord, that you would just be with her, Lord, even in the most difficult of times, Father. She would know without a doubt that you are there with her. Father, we ask for this blessing in the name of Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; Amen. God bless you. Amen. Good to be in the house of the Lord today. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. I'm just so thankful for what the Lord gives to us. We see so many I won't go into detail on it, but we see so many incredible things how the Lord just comes and and he speaks to us and it's in season. &gt;&gt; Amen. We We're not the one in control. God's the one in control and he speaks to us and and it's not just he singles one single person out to speak to them but he's speaking to a body. I come across a quote the other day. I wished I would have included it. Brother Brandham saying this is the same Holy Spirit moving all around the world. Amen. Aren't you glad to be a part of that to see that what God is doing here he is doing other places. Thank you musicians. Sorry distraction here. Oh wait I'm preaching on distraction. So anyway, look at this, my brothers and sisters. How that we are such a blessed people sometimes all the cares of life we kind of forget a little bit, but uh I say today, thank you Lord for for what you've done. Let's just stand for the reading of the word and um just uh want to speak to you this morning. Now, I struggled to really put I had a whole list of titles and and felt like I I would more drawn to this one. Um, captivated by the revelation. And we understand the word captivated uh is talking about how that we are drawn to uh and uh uh focused upon and kept in that focus. So, a captivation is not just a passing whim. It's not just something that came today left tomorrow. But to be captivated is that and we know that to be captivated is uh very important. There's a lot of things uh in our relationships, marriage, etc. It's it always pays to have a captivated marriage versus an indifferent one. Amen. And as Christians to have a captivated relationship versus an indifferent one. and and there's a lot of things that if you're an employer, you want a captivated employee, not an indifferent one. Amen. So, we'll see the in influence of this. Amen. So, let's just turn in our Bibles to Psalms, the 27th chapter. Maybe seems like a little bit different uh uh scripture to use for a thought like this, but this is David expressing who the Lord is to him. Right. &gt;&gt; He's basically saying he's my everything. &gt;&gt; He He's what He's what's drawn me. He's what's keeping me. Amen. The Lord is my light and my salvation. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Whom shall I fear? The Lord is the strength of my life. Of whom shall I be afraid? When the wicked, even mine enemies and my foes come upon me to eat up my flesh, they stumbled and fell. And I want to ask you today, I pray, I pray you can say yes to this, but do you have an evidence in your life that your enemies have come, stumbled, and fell? &gt;&gt; Amen. I believe as a Christian, as believers today, we have evidence that our enemies have stumbled and fell. They have not overcome us. They've not conquered us. Amen. We are not captive to Satan's plan. That's right. &gt;&gt; Amen. Though a host should encamp against me, my heart shall not fear. Though war should rise against me, in this will I be confident. One thing have I desired of the Lord, that will I seek after, that I may dwell in the house of the Lord all the days of my life. Amen. &gt;&gt; To behold the beauty of the Lord and to inquire in his temple. For in the time of trouble he shall hide me in his pavilion. In the secret of his tabernacle shall he hide me. For he he shall set me upon a rock. Amen. &gt;&gt; And now shall my head be lifted up above mine enemies. Round about me. Therefore will I offer in his tabernacle sacrifices of joy. I will sing. Yay. I will sing praises unto the Lord. Here, O Lord, when I cry with my voice, have mercy upon also upon me, and answer me. When thou saidest, seek ye my face, my heart said unto thee, thy face, Lord, will I seek. &gt;&gt; Amen. Can we lift a hand this morning and say, Lord, thy face will I seek. Amen. For he's speaking to a bride. He's calling out to this bride and she's here to say, "Yes, my Lord. Yes, my Lord." Heavenly Father, we just ask you this morning, Lord, to just come in our midst. Lord, many distractions of the week, of the days, Father, little things in our health, a cough, a a sore throat, a this or that. Father, all these things would be there to try to keep us from giving praise to you. But this morning, Lord, we lift our voices and say, Lord, we love you and we thank you this morning for your grace and for your mercy that you have so freely poured out upon us, Lord. How we appreciate what you've done for us. And I ask you this morning, Lord, as you come, move in our midst. Speak to our hearts, Lord, that we would be able this morning just to open up, Father, and let our hearts be able to speak. And Father, we're not looking, Father, at this flesh. We're not looking at failure. We're looking at a promise. And the promise is coming to pass right before our eyes. And we thank you for that. Lord, I ask for your blessing on the saints today in the precious name of Jesus Christ. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. You may be seated. God bless you, brother Daniel. Good to see you, my friend. Amen. Each and every one of you, good to see you today. Praise the uh Lord for for a wonderful group of people to fellowship, to worship with. Amen. And it's here in this age that we're living in that um it's getting harder and harder, saints. You know, just look at the natural side of life. Amen. I just saw a little report. You know, there's a whole issue in the farm community uh of uh what's happening economically. And uh connected to that was this little graph of what it took to buy a house uh 50 years ago. And and uh it does make my heart ache a little bit for our young people because we're moving into a time that that it's almost become an impossibility for many young couples uh to to go out and and be able to get started on a solid footing. But yet I can tell you this just in my youngster age here that um it's never been easy. And the scripture tells us that we're living in the darkest time there is in history. And yet my brother and sister we might in oursel look back to the dark ages and say my you know we're not going through what they're going through but you are. Amen. those same spirits of fear and anxieties, depressions, and all of these things that were there in that day that caused many people in the in Fox's book of uh mortars. I said that for my wife's sake, martyrs. Amen. that um it it it accounts to that how many people come to points in their life that they had served God for seasons and then something clicked and they said it's too hard. My brother and sister, I'm telling you, it's no harder today for the day we live in than it has been in any other age. Because there's an anointing has come down in this hour of the word to anoint you and I. If we will receive that anointing, we will be overcomers. Amen. So don't look and say, "We're living in the worst time. I can't do it." No. Receive the anointing of the hour. And that anointing is sufficient to get you through the challenge of our day. &gt;&gt; Amen. So the world we live in today is full of things to captivate us. You know, it doesn't matter what you have an interest in. There's enough information, uh, enough things to get a hold of our attention that, uh, it's sports, politics, uh, you know, I would put it this way. There's a magazine for everything. There's a book for everything. Uh, there's just so many things we can go into information overload. And sometimes my brother and sister, I don't know about you, uh I know brother Barry has spoke quite a bit extensively on AI and its impact and what is coming and we'll see that. But I have decided in a very short time that I don't like AI. I don't like my phone trying to finish my sentence for me. I I don't want my computer telling me you don't want to look for this. You want to look for this. Amen. So we'll see this artificial intelligence that is out there. Now think about what that is in a carnal world. Now think about what it is in a spiritual world. Amen. Satan coming down saying, "You want more of God? This is what you need. You want more of God, do this." My brother and sister, while Google might be accurate for most things, I'm not going to trust my life to Google. And I'm certainly not going to trust the devil for my spiritual leadership. I'm not going to trust him to do what's best for me or for you. Amen. So, we sit here today and realize in the world of information overload, now I'm just I hope you don't mind me bringing this on a personal level. I have had to push back on this. I am offered and still offered just literally dozens of free magazines to do with agriculture. They just they want you to take it. I quit filling out their renew for free cards about five years ago and I still receive them. They want you to have this so bad. And and as I said say to sister Jerry, you know what? I could take this same month uh five years ago and the articles are just rewarded, but they're the exact same thing. There's nothing new that is written in those magazines. What they're there for is a distraction to consume the time of Sons and Daughters of God. Amen. Now look, some of you that just love to decorate, you're crafty, all of this. I promise you, if you will go back and look through all those things, you'll see the scripture says nothing new under the sun. All it is is Satan trying to distract you and I because that's the one thing we only have a limited amount of time is time. Amen. We cannot go and create more time. And so Satan's come, he's trying to convince us that these things are necessary parts of their life. Amen. And so you look at this and realize it doesn't matter what point you're doing. It doesn't matter. I would say the about the only thing, this is an opinion, the only thing there is on earth that is not redundant is the word. And we could preach the word on the same subjects over and over, year after year, and God is always on time. It's always in a season that comes and touches something in our life. The word will never be redundant. The rest of the information on this world here, it in a sense is redundant. Now, is there breakthrough? I'm not saying there's no more things coming forth. Uh it is there. My brother and sister, we know that there is. But we're talking about in an overall picture. And the word is the one thing that is guaranteed to change you and I. Amen. And we have uh not a magazine as it were, but we have a book. And I said, you know, they have a book for everything. Well, let me turn that phrase, if you can pull this thought with your mind, we have a book for everything. Amen. It doesn't matter what's going on in your life, this book has answers. Amen. It will change our life if we won't get distracted from this book. Amen. So, we look at this. No, I love a good bit of history. I I love studying history uh and and those kind of things, but those should just be placed as a a sideline as it were. Now, I spoke a few years ago here at the church on uh several sermons on a distracted generation. And uh so, you know, you look at that and realize what is happening in the day that we live in. Now, I I believe any of us who have any kind of smart device or iPad, a computer, etc., you you go to check your email and then there's something else and you go to it for a moment and then that leads you to something here for a moment and then it leads you here to a moment and then pretty soon you're like oh my an hour's gone by &gt;&gt; but I wasn't done reading that article so I got to finish reading the article and then that's how Satan robs our time and often times he's inserting in all of this information that we would not norm normally digest, but because it's in something we're focusing on, you know, you will see how that in the world we're living, excuse me, the world that we're living in, as we would say, that the word of God, nothing happens by chance, right? Every bit of word of God is is for our life, for a purpose. Now I want you to understand Satan studied the plan of God so thoroughly everything that Satan does is not by chance. It is for a purpose. &gt;&gt; So when we come face to face with these struggles, these challenges in our lives and we'll look at that and we first off need to recognize that it's not God doing this but it's Satan, we'll realize what he's trying to do and and he's trying to to cause something to happen. and he's trying to plant a seed. He's trying to encourage a seed that's already been planted. Maybe a bit of discouragement is in your life and you think, "Well, this doesn't matter." He's there to reinforce it. Doesn't matter. Amen. If there's something there that's trying to turn you away from the word of God, then he's there to bring evidence that you need to just leave the word alone. Life is just fine. Look at all these people out here driving new cars, living in nice big houses, taking wonderful vacations that don't even believe in a god. Why do you need a god? And so you see how Satan would work on this. And we'll be there and and realize that we could talk forever just on that thought. But my brother and sister, we are living in a distracted time, a time that is is got so much information overload. Uh if you dare waste your time, you can go on the computer and find out that's one of the greatest challenges corporate America has today or uh and uh business in general has today is distraction in the workplace. And it's not just the employees out here that are, you know, these uneducated, not too valuable people. It goes all the way up to the highest office in the skyscraper of how much distraction there is in their life. And it was there that one man, a reporter, uh, wrote in there. He said, "So many executives make statements such as, "One of the things I dislike about my job is a lack of time with my family." And then they dive into that and figure out that they could save sometimes up to four hours a day in wasted time. And they could go apply that four hours to their family. But see how it's eroded? It's there. It's digging it out. And we feel like whatever we're doing is justified. It's necessary. This is who we are. This is what we do. But yet, Satan is stealing that time from us. Amen. People will say, "I don't have time to pray." Well, we need to stop and look at where we are spending our time. Because if we spend our time on things that are of no profit, then how do we expect that to reward us or benefit us? So you look at this now and uh we have to remember this is the age this is a season the final closing chapter or uh curtains of the play that is there and and we need to remember what we were called to focus on. Amen. It's here my brother and sister. Now it's always such a t touchy subject amongst Christians you know to talk about money but I I'm here just to keep it real simple. If you have no relationship with Jesus Christ, your money's going to burn. If you do have a relationship with Jesus Christ, your money's gonna burn. &gt;&gt; So what is the common theme of that? Your money burning. &gt;&gt; But it's whether you have a relationship with the Lord or you don't. That's it. &gt;&gt; So it doesn't change anything here on the earth or this position. The money's going to burn. Amen. The nice house going to burn. The car is going to burn. All of these things are going to burn. What we need to focus on is a relationship with Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; Amen. And in that there has to be an attraction. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. I I'll put it this way. People have this idea that God chose you. He's just going to force you to serve him. Not so, my brother and sister. But the law of attraction, if you study it out, God has placed something in you. Now, we can go down and say, "Look, there's a seed in the soul or the heart of man, and that seed's going to respond." But I'm telling you, it goes deeper because this relationship with Jesus Christ is in essence, don't don't think I'm discarding the seed. It's very necessary, but this is a law of attraction that Christ is looking for a bride. Now, every man that's ever looked for a wife, every woman that's ever looked for a husband, the potential that's there, there has to be an attraction. Amen. There has to be something beyond she has money, he has money, she's good-looking, he's good-looking. It has to go beyond that. The prophet of God told us that you look for someone with character in your life. Now, I want you to take this over into the spiritual realm here and look what it is. When Christ looked at you, he saw character. He sees character in you that you don't even see in yourself. But he sees the potential of this coming and being revealed. And when you look to Jesus Christ, when you are sick and you need a healer, you don't look to the devil. Amen. He's a killer. Amen. But our Lord Jesus Christ is a savior. He's a healer. So, we're looking to character to bring this relationship as a Christian down to a more natural relationship as we look at this because after all, we were created in his image and this is who we are. &gt;&gt; So, that means we're reflecting as believers his image or his character. So, we look for that character and he's looked for that character in you and I. And it's there that that is one of the things that captivates us as sons and daughters of God is here's someone who is willing to die for me. Sister Sue bought me a book some time back here of some military history and these men 50 years after going in combat. The man remembers to the inth detail of the man who saved his life. And he says, "And I remember him and pray for him every single day." Amen. &gt;&gt; That is just natural, my brother and sister, of a man who would save a man's life. Amen. Now, look at where we are at as sons and daughters of God. Our lives have been saved. Can someone say amen? Our lives have been saved. And so, every day we should be lifting our voice to say, "Thank you, Lord, for saving me. Thank you, Lord, for what you've done for me. I would be dead and lost, but will you come and spared my life?" Amen. That's the kind of attraction that should captivate us that we would look at and say, "I can never forget who I used to be, but I was washed in his blood and I know who I am today by the promise of the word." &gt;&gt; Oh, do I make mistakes? Do I come short? Do I have failures? I do. But my brother and sister, I cannot forget what he has done for me. &gt;&gt; Amen. So, it's there that this day that we remember Jesus Christ is our main thing. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You hear that phrase out in the world. You know, I I've come across several little things recently here. You're in a store and somebody's like, "Oh, I've never met your husband before." And they're proud. They turn, "This is my main thing. This is the main man." You're thinking, "Is there another one?" &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; No. What they're saying is this the only one that's important right here. &gt;&gt; Amen. and they made an introduction. &gt;&gt; And I've also heard a little ahead of myself, but I've also heard recently Jesus is the reason for this season. &gt;&gt; Well, my brother and sister sister, it doesn't start with a season. Doesn't end with the season. He is the main thing. &gt;&gt; Amen. He is who we are, what we are, why we live. The very essence of our life is Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; Amen. So you look at that. I would go as far as to say &gt;&gt; anything outside of that, &gt;&gt; Amen, &gt;&gt; is a distraction. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Some distractions necessary. Scripture says if man doesn't work, he doesn't eat. But that job is a distraction. Let's face it. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I mean, some of us are maybe certified workaholics, &gt;&gt; but at my age, I've realized if I could, I would live without working. Do I get any amens? See, it it's there. It's it's what but we're so trained in the culture. Now, the scriptures wasn't really talking about Leodysia when he says that if you don't work, you don't eat. He's talking about breaking a spirit of being slothful, lazy, etc. A man who wouldn't care for his children, his wife, his household. Amen. &gt;&gt; Right? That man is a repbate. That's according to the word. &gt;&gt; Right? But it's not saying that we have to make a god out of work. &gt;&gt; No, sir. &gt;&gt; So, we got to put work where it belongs. And it's actually quite a ways down the ladder. Amen. Of what God's called us to be or who he identifies us as. Now, I've been guilty, very guilty of that in my life. Amen. So, you know, sometimes we'll look at this and anything outside of our Lord Jesus Christ is a distraction. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Evil is a distraction. Amen. &gt;&gt; What is keeping us sometimes from actually having an overcoming life? &gt;&gt; Oursel. &gt;&gt; Amen. That's exactly right. &gt;&gt; I'm going to say it kind of bluntly. &gt;&gt; Ourselves. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Have just as many attributes expressed of evil. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; As they do of good. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Born in sin, shaped in iniquity. Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; Come into the world lying, cheating, and stealing. Had a good time with the kids at Grace Kids. Amen. a fun time and we talked about this serpent brazen serpent in the wilderness had a few little rubber snakes and the kids got into that biting each other anyway. So, but it was fun. I I believe they got to the point. But you see, inherently we ourselves, we can't stand and say, "Oh, praise God. I'm such a good person." &gt;&gt; Because without the Lord Jesus Christ, without the values that he placed in us, we would just be like the world. Amen. And you know sometimes good things can be so focused on we can focus so intently on them that good things can become a distraction. &gt;&gt; Absolutely. &gt;&gt; We we can be just doing the best things. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; And if they're not in balance, &gt;&gt; it becomes a distraction to us. &gt;&gt; That's exactly right. I remember many years ago, I don't speak ill of this man, but he made a decision that his wife could work while he stayed home and prayed and read the Bible. Amen. Sounded good on paper, just not on the page in the Bible, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; So really what it was is he found an excuse not to go to work. So he focused on prayer and the Bible and forsook the other truths that were in the very book he was reading. The very truths of what he was doing to his wife to push her out there. Amen. Make her support the family while he stayed home and mowed the grass. And there was only I don't know three or four of them. The family. He made a big deal. Sisters don't throw things. He made a big deal about how he vacuumed the floor and washed the dishes. Now, he was using that as a justification to push his wife out of the house. Are you with me? &gt;&gt; So, he was actually while he thought he was doing something good, he's actually pushing her out into a position God never called her to be in. &gt;&gt; Now, we all know, let's not get into the whole sisters working thing. We know what the prophet of God said about that. But you see when that is caused by someone who just doesn't want to work himself, you'll see that that actually becomes evil. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; It becomes a distraction. Amen. And so these good things sometimes focused on incorrectly can also be to a distraction to us in our life. Now, brother Brandham says here in the sermon, looking for Jesus. Now, we want to speak uh as every meeting about Jesus Christ. And he's the center of our worship. Can we say as a church amen to that? &gt;&gt; The center of our attraction, the center of our life, all that we have and want are and will be is based upon him. &gt;&gt; Amen. So we cannot when you take this a a as this phrase is nature abhores a vacuum right. So when we were intended to be worshippers and to serve the Lord Jesus Christ but yet we remove him it creates a vacuum there that vacuum will not remain empty. Something will fill that point. something will come in and it will then not cause a blessing in our life, but it actually is a little serpent. And that's why I brought up the the kids. &gt;&gt; Amen. Not every one of those serpents that were out there in the wilderness looked like some great big huge snake with huge fangs. There was some little ones. &gt;&gt; And some of those little ones I I I'm sorry. I just had kind of just a chuckle out of the kids. You know, they were expressing that they understood what I was talking about. Take that little snake and it's like then you ask the kids, "So, what is the snake bite?" You know, they got right down home. I mean, they didn't spare themselves at all. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; When we lie, &gt;&gt; we've been bit by the snake, the serpent. &gt;&gt; When we And we went right down through the list. They didn't even spare themselves. I was so proud of them. Now, they might not have fully comprehended what they were saying, but I really honestly believe. Now, I'm going to go overboard here, not so much more so, but little brother Samuel stood right there and says, "Brother Paul, Brother Paul, Brother Paul." And he says, "What it was is the serpent when he bit." Now, this is the same serpent connected back to the Garden of Eden. The same one that was lying to Eve and deceived Eve and it was there. It doesn't say bitter, but he did, didn't he? &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; Yeah, he sure did. Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; Amen. So, look how these little things can come in our life. We say, "Praise God, I I'm serving the Lord." We got to watch out for the little serpent. &gt;&gt; We got to watch out for the little besetting sin that creeps in. Also, God help us. I lift my hand and say, "Lord, help me. &gt;&gt; Help me, Lord." Because it's these little things, the little foxes that spoil the vine. And so we have a whole picture that God is wanting us to look at. Not just look at deep revelations. Oh, praise God. I can explain the thunders and the seals and the vials and I I can No, my brother and sister. This the serpent might be biting. Your legs might be just punctured full of holes and you still be able to explain those things. It won't do you a bit of good. No. So all that we have and want are and will be is based upon him. He was the one who came and gave his life for us, came down from God out of glory and was made flesh, dwelt among us and taken upon us upon him the sin of us all, the sickness of us all. Right there, my brother and sister, you can actually tie that right back to a brazen serpent. &gt;&gt; Amen. He took the sickness of the bite of Satan. Amen. The serpent, he took that and he took it away from us because I'll make a bold statement to say there wouldn't be one of us here this morning living if he did not take away the bite of the serpent. &gt;&gt; Amen. That bite has been nullified. The antivenenom, the word has come and left us living. Amen. Instead of dead. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. Bore it away to Calvary and there paid the price. He's worthy of all praise that be can be given him. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. You see, sometimes when the song leader, maybe a minister, somebody says, "Hey, let's just worship the Lord. Let's give him praise." It's not about edifying what the man behind the pulpit is doing. It's about fulfilling this word that he is worthy of all of our praise. Amen. All that we can give him, he is worthy of that. It's not about who's right, who's wrong, who's more spiritual, who's more this, who's more that. It's about you and him and you recognizing I have no life but him. &gt;&gt; And I say thank you cuz I want to live. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I want to rise up. I want to be what God called me to be. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Now, &gt;&gt; I kind of got ahead of myself. It's a time of year we hear this. Jesus is the reason for the season. He's the reason for every season in our life. &gt;&gt; Amen. Spring, summer, &gt;&gt; fall, winter. Amen. Take all of those to the seasons of your life. Not nature out here. To the seasons of your life, in the renewal time as you come in a maturity, as we start to fade away and the hard struggles that the winter can bring to us, he's there for us all the time. Amen. Our God is not a seasonal God. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; He is the very reason for our season. And what is our season, saints? The prophet of God clearly shows us that this season right now is a season of the maturing of the bride. She's coming into that season, into that place that she's no longer a babe, but now she can move away from the milk and she's now starting to get into a real diet. Amen. And it's not just a natural meat they're talking about, but it's talking about spiritual meat. And we're coming now. This is not something that requires, oh, they got to be this old to get into this spiritual meat. It is a spiritual maturity that brings you and I to a place that the word speaks to us. You can read that scripture and you can read it for years, but one day God says, "This is a season. This is a time. This is your trial. This is your circumstance. This is your desperation. This is your need." And the word comes alive to you and you say, "Thank you, Lord. I needed that right now." And the Lord would be here if he wanted to speak to you and say, "I know that. That's why I gave it to you. That's right. &gt;&gt; Right now. &gt;&gt; So, this maturity bringing us to this place, what is it doing? It's moving us more. Now, God obviously, look at us today, saints. God obviously doesn't when he talks about his image talk about one facial profile. If so, who do we choose? &gt;&gt; The only thing we can choose is his. &gt;&gt; That's exactly right. Otherwise, you know, if it was all this brother, this sister, this &gt;&gt; No, no. &gt;&gt; But the word is coming molding the one thing that is of value. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; Studying the scripture, my brother and sister, and then going back seeing what the prophet of God said about it. So, people have different ideas about burial and what will happen. But the prophet of God says, you know, those bones laying at the bottom of the sea. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; When he calls them, &gt;&gt; they will come back. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; God don't care where those bones are. &gt;&gt; He's not redeeming bones. &gt;&gt; Amen. But what they are associated with or tied to, God's redeeming that. And it's God that is the restorer of all things. He's the one that restored our souls to him. He's the one that put us, brought us, created us. So, we don't need a natural image that we try to follow. But my brother and sister, now we all understand in the book uh uh uh talking about Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego and the image that they were called to worship. I believe we should all understand that that image was Daniel, &gt;&gt; right? There was a prophet and that was the image that they were being called was to worship the image of the prophet. &gt;&gt; And they said, "We won't do it." No. &gt;&gt; No sir. &gt;&gt; Now, you'll never find nowhere where Daniel himself said, "Guys, there'll come a day just worship me." &gt;&gt; No, sir. &gt;&gt; No, no, no, no. &gt;&gt; Daniel, a man of wisdom, led by the Holy Spirit, guided by God, a man of wisdom. He pointed the people constantly to God. Constantly to Jehovah. Constantly Jehovah. Now, I want to bring it right down. In the day we're living in, my brother and sister, we had a prophet of God that put it as words to the page and said, "I've never come to draw you to myself." Amen. I've always just wanted you to have a relationship with Jesus Christ. That's who I want to introduce you to is Jesus Christ. So you see the very same spirit that was there that was trying to get Shadrach and Mach to uh uh worship that image, that same spirits appeared in this day, my brother and sister. A little bite &gt;&gt; of the serpent. &gt;&gt; Oh, but brother Paul, they live good lives. &gt;&gt; So the foolish virgin. &gt;&gt; That's exactly right. &gt;&gt; I know that's kind of straightforward, but I think I think we ought to just face the truth. I think we ought to just face what the reality of the day we're living in. &gt;&gt; We're living in a day that those things that were typed in Joseph &gt;&gt; are coming to pass today. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So, it's there. We should be captivated in the revelation of the word for our day to realize God won't let you worship a false image. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Come on, saints. He's calling you as the bride of Jesus Christ to worship the true image which is him. &gt;&gt; Amen. Nothing else. &gt;&gt; Now, I hope that wasn't offensive to anybody, but sometimes we just have to deal with these things because it's the truth. We have a perfect type right there in scripture. Brother Brandham even makes reference to it. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So, we're looking here. Let's just go ahead and go to what is the attraction on the mountain mountain. God then what was he doing? What is that attraction up there on the hill? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; It's God making history and God fulfilling prophecy. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So twofold taking place right there, right? God is coming here. He's making history. You want to know saints this morning you are sitting here in the house of God. Whatever God's dealing with in your life, how your prayer life is, how you spiritually feel, all of this, you are making history today. Amen. And God's right here. He promised to be in our midst. Is he? I I think he is. &gt;&gt; I think he promised it and it'll happen. Amen. So, it's also prophecy being fulfilled that we'll sit here today and realize that the word prophesied the position we're in today. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. And sometimes our own words, how many of you prophesy? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I think every single one of you ought to be lifting a hand. Amen. Amen. Your body will obey your confession. And your confession says, "I'm an overcomer." Then you're prophesying your future as an overcomer. If you say, "I am defeated or I can't do it." Your body will obey your own prophecy of the position you choose to take. Amen. &gt;&gt; And then people will say, "Well, later they'll say, "I knew I couldn't do it." Well, of course you prophesied you couldn't do it. &gt;&gt; But if you'll stand here today and say, "The word of God says, not me, not the preacher, no one else. The word of God says I'm an overcomer. I've got a seed gene in me. I've got his nature. I've got his character. I've got his attributes. I've even got his DNA in me. I will overcome." &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. That's it. Though all hail assail me, I shall not be moved. &gt;&gt; We can't do that in this flesh, saints. But I tell you, the word coming out of your own mouth will set you in a position that you can come and in the darkest of hours say, you know what? I've got a reason to be excited. I've got something. Because a revelation came to me and it wasn't a passing revelation. I was captivated by that revelation. God said it. I believed it. And I made it my own revelation. I made it my own confession and it captivated me. It caught my attention and it kept my attention. &gt;&gt; I don't care. Offer me a fleet of Cadillacs. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; That's exactly right. &gt;&gt; I tell you, it's kind of interesting. So, Brother George Smith was down in Phoenix. He was there with brother Ron Peterson and they he was giving his testimony. And uh, of course, I I've had the privilege to know Brother George well enough to know testimony, not in its entirety, not to say boastfully I've got the whole thing, but I've heard a lot of it and I've heard it multiple times. Never changes. So, I'm kind of assuming it's the truth. I shouldn't have worded it that way. It is the truth. I don't have to assume. But brother George even addresses the Cadillac &gt;&gt; and he says, "You know, Brother Bannon was embarrassed." &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; By that car. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; And he put it off to the side for the longest time until it wasn't the latest &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; fashion styling, whatever. And ultimately has a car. It's sitting there. It was comfortable. It was quiet. was all these things and he finally starts to drive it. Do you realize saints by brother Brown's testimony he could have had a fleet? &gt;&gt; He was embarrassed to drive one that he let it sit around till it was aged. That's right. &gt;&gt; And he was embarrassed to drive it. He could have had a fleet. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. You know that businessman that his wife got healed and he just tells Brother Brown, "You tell me what to write on this check." &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; And Brother Brown says, "I'd rather you not." &gt;&gt; That's it. &gt;&gt; You see, my brother and sister, it wasn't for worldly gain. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; That he was coming. He was coming because there had to be a message that was trumpeted to the world today. But you know what? The trumpet is not that I'm just paraphrasing the scripture. The trumpeting of the trumpet is no importance if there's no one to hear the trumpet. &gt;&gt; Amen. And we're here today. It's been trumpeted and we are hearing it and we are seeing it and it's coming to pass and our lives are reflecting it. And let me just put it this strongly. You don't have to say, "Well, I'm a believer." Cuz my brother and sister, we can stand here today and say, "I'm a believer." Because the very word that they said would come to pass is coming to pass in me. Amen. &gt;&gt; I don't have to look out here. I don't need to look at brother Brandham. I don't need to look at George Smith, Donnie Reagan, or anybody else. I can look right here at me and see the word coming to pass. &gt;&gt; Exactly. Right. &gt;&gt; And we should, every one of us, be able to say that that's what's happening to me. I actually see God dealing with me, God changing me, God raising me up into heavenly places. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Amen. Then what was he doing? The attraction up there on the hill. God making history. God fulfilling prophecy. And that always causes an attraction. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; How many times mothers I mean I don't know. I just we saw this happen when we were raising our children in a restaurant. People would say, "You have the best behaved children we've ever seen." And you almost want like really you just caught them at a good moment. Maybe you weren't looking at my children. But you see, even and my point I want to make, even down into our children, &gt;&gt; there's a reflection of Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. It's become so common to us, &gt;&gt; we maybe don't even recognize it in our children, in our wife, in our husband, &gt;&gt; in our fellow church members. &gt;&gt; You know, Brother Bram said, "When a church loses its love, &gt;&gt; that's the finish of that church." &gt;&gt; Saints, until the Lord comes, I'm not ready for Grace Tabernacle to be done away with, become cold, dead, formal. Let's fall in love with one another correctly, of course. Let's let's be in love with one another, lifting each other up before the Lord. Amen. Caring about what's happening in the lives of those around us. That's what makes a live, vibrant church. &gt;&gt; Not who wears the best clothes or drives the best car. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Come on. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; So, it's there you see that always calls an attraction. It brings all the critics up, the vultures in parentheses of this morning's message. Praise God. I hope none of you are that hard on me. And the eagles also may come together to find out what's going on. Some coming for curiosity. Now look, I don't know who's going to be the bride of Christ and who isn't. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; But we've had our share of the curious &gt;&gt; pass through our church. &gt;&gt; So much so, maybe I'll boast on the preacher for just a moment. You guys don't mind if we boast on the pastor of the church. I've literally after this service, most everyone's left, had people speak to my face and say, "You're the most incredible pastor I've ever heard. I'll see you next Sunday." What I realized later, Brother Trevor, is next Sunday, depends on where you're on the calendar here. So, what do those words mean? &gt;&gt; Right? So somebody saying, "I'm so blessed." &gt;&gt; Really doesn't mean much. &gt;&gt; It's what it actually does to them &gt;&gt; that makes the difference. &gt;&gt; Amen. Not how they emotionally felt at the moment. &gt;&gt; That's it. &gt;&gt; But how they felt deep down inside in their time alone. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And God dealing with them. See, so they come together. Some for curiosity. Some coming to find fault, others coming criticize. There's all kinds gathered. As we said this morning, believers make believers, unbelievers, what's on the mountain. And this is my real focus of this quote. Prophecy is being fulfilled. Now, we'll see what takes place. &gt;&gt; Prophecy &gt;&gt; being fulfilled. &gt;&gt; Amen. Right. Exactly. &gt;&gt; What takes place. &gt;&gt; Amen. The real bride of Christ says, "That's who I always thought I was &gt;&gt; and now I see that's who I am." &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. It went from a thought to a reality. Amen. And when that reality come and was expressed, we don't stand up and say, "Praise God, I'm such a good Christian. I'm such a good believer." No, we say, "Oh Lord," we humble ourselves. Lord, thank you. What you've done for me, Lord. I couldn't have done it. It's a prophecy of your word. It's what your word for foretold is coming out in me. &gt;&gt; That's it. &gt;&gt; And we could say, I'm not even trying to make it happen. &gt;&gt; That's it. Exactly. &gt;&gt; It's just happening. &gt;&gt; Oh my, my brother and sister, how beautiful that is. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. See, prophecy fulfilled. The word prophesied it would call out a people. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. I I would ask you this morning, is there some here today that have a conviction that you were called out? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. We're not just here by chance. There's a conviction down in our heart. There's something solid down in our heart that says, "I know I was called out." &gt;&gt; Amen. I know it was that voice. Amen. as the eagle and the and the the mama eagle and the young eagle. Amen. He always wondered, can you imagine what it'd be? I one day I just sat there and listened to some chickens, you know, and there was two or three kinds uh my daughter Kristen had there and there was these little guys that had their hair all whipped up in a wave, you know, and they just strutdded around like they were just the best little but they were just little guys. And then there was a big guy that was kind of ugly. walked around crowing, crowing, crowing like I'm the king of this roost, but he was kind of ugly, you know. And as the brother Brian Jones would say, your eagles aren't even real message eagles. What? Yeah. Look at him. Look at our eagle. He's talking about a man. He's got legs on all the way down to his feet. Your American eagles are running around in shorts. They're not even real eagles. Well, good revelation, brother Brian. He if you go there today, he'll tell you that. I guarantee you that's something he holds to. We don't even have a real eagle. They have the real eagle. Amen. So, you look at that, you see, my brother and sister, what image are we being molded to? What are we being drawn? Are we forced by the preaching here in the church to be a certain way? Or is there something calling, something pulling, something that you can't resist? &gt;&gt; I can assure you, you can resist whatever I would speak. But when God, the Holy Spirit starts to deal with your life, you can't resist. &gt;&gt; Amen. The word is captivating you. Amen. It's the Holy Spirit that's drawing you in. &gt;&gt; Amen. And it's the word that's held your attention. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. My brother and sister, I tell you, it's it's so interesting how it is. I remember from my childhood some of the first words, first time my family, they ever come went sat down to listen to a tape. And you got to understand, we were pretty wild, rambunctious kids. And I remember my dad, I'm not defaulting on my dad, but just the words that he said, "If you boys don't behave, I'll whip you when we get home." Amen. That was enough. He knew how to whoop a kid. Amen. But I remember sitting on a floor in our friend's house and hearing those words for the first time. Good morning, friends. &gt;&gt; That's it, sir. &gt;&gt; Now, that echo is still in my mind to this day. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; And back then, I was just a kid. It didn't register. Now, I realize &gt;&gt; he was talking to me. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I'm a friend of the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. And when I get to glory, I'll be able to say, I'm a friend of the prophet. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. Because I am a friend of the word. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. And it's there that God is using this to put us in the right place. Amen. So the word attracted you. The word held your attention. Was it a single doctrine? Was it baptism that caught you? Was it the thunders that caught you? Thunders caught a lot of people but caught them. They kind of caught them in the tail or, you know, the fin or whatever because they're not really caught. Oh. Oh, what could it be that caught you? &gt;&gt; Christ himself. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Even when you go back in scripture and you see that they told them you'd be fishers of men. &gt;&gt; It wasn't the apostles catching them. &gt;&gt; No. &gt;&gt; It was the gospel of Jesus Christ catching them. &gt;&gt; Amen. Because if if it had been Peter that caught them, then ultimately Peter would have lost them. Cuz Peter, you got to remember, was pretty rough around the edges. Amen. Sooner or later, he'd have said something that would have offended them and they'd have said, "This guy's too much." &gt;&gt; But when you ever get caught by the gospel, &gt;&gt; the word of God in your hour, &gt;&gt; you are so so so captivated. &gt;&gt; It has caught your attention and it's kept a hold of you and you can't get away from it. And I say that here not to be on a negative side, but how many times have we through the years said, "I don't think I can go any further. I just can't do this. I'm going to quit." Amen. I know that's a pre we call it preachers flu. Ah, worst sermon I ever preached. I'm quitting. And then Wednesday night, you got more notes than you can possibly preach again. And then after Wednesday night, you have preachers flu again. &gt;&gt; It's a good deal that flu don't kill you. Amen. But you see what it is is we are in this battle of the spiritual &gt;&gt; and the flesh. &gt;&gt; That's exactly &gt;&gt; spiritual flesh. Every one of you faces this battle. Spiritual flesh. Spiritual flesh. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. But imagine now you've heard me say this before. It's and I'm not the first to ever preach it. When the prophet of God saw, he hears this onward Christian soldier and he sees this church coming and she's dressed horribly. Go read what brother Ram's talking about that vision how he describes it. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; That's today. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; When he preached that, &gt;&gt; they'd arrested somebody for dressing like that in public. But there they are. I don't want to go in depth too much. Barely covered, &gt;&gt; indecent. &gt;&gt; Uh just horrible. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And now that can be seen on any street in any city in any country. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I'll give you an idea about that, my brother and sister. I will share this enough. A few years ago, Argentina, we drove down into the far reaches of Patagonia. We went out there. There was some believers that had people had been introduced to the message, lived out there. And so we went there, rented the town hall. We held services there. And I was had this just crazy idea that we're so far out in the boonies that that it won't be, you know, anything. It'll just be somehow different. We walked into the little market. The girl behind the cash register looked like she belonged in Nampa, Idaho at Circle K. I didn't mean to defame you, Circle K. &gt;&gt; See, it's the same spirit. &gt;&gt; It is. &gt;&gt; And the music coming through the speakers &gt;&gt; was the same exact music that would be coming through the speakers right here. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So, just as the Holy Spirit's moving all around the world, the antichrist spirit has reached every back eddy, every place there is to reach because no one's going to be without excuse on that day. You will not have an excuse. You'll either be in Christ. Amen. Captivated by the word or you're going to be outside. That's exactly. &gt;&gt; Amen. That's just a simple fact of it. I don't say that judgmental because I'm still working on making sure that my salvation is secure. Amen. We're not looking down our nose at anybody. But we're still doing what God asked us to do. &gt;&gt; Amen. So, look at this. We don't want to be distracted, right? You are part of this prophecy. Don't get distracted from that. I don't understand this. I don't see this. I struggle here. Don't get distracted. You are part of this prophecy. And this prophecy must come to pass. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You see, can we cut it right down to super simple? What this book told us is that Christ wanted a bride. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; He doesn't want a girlfriend. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Absolutely. A girlfriend implies that she can be set aside. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; And another one can be drawn in to take her place. &gt;&gt; Exactly. &gt;&gt; This is how the boyfriend girlfriend relationship exists in the world today. &gt;&gt; Now, let let me just deviate from this so I don't leave the wrong thought in kids' minds. We don't court. We don't date for fun. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; We have already prayed. We have already sought God. We have already asked God, is this the right one? &gt;&gt; And then when you have the law of attraction, remember we talked about that earlier. I know it was a long time ago today, but we talked about that earlier. Amen. There's got to be a law of attraction. Oh, she has the most beautiful blue eyes. Now, those of you have blue eyes, don't be offended. She's meaner than a bag of tom cats. that she has the most beautiful blue eyes. I could just stare into them eyes until the tom cats get loose. That ain't going to work. Oh, he's got such beautiful curly hair. And then you wake up one day, he has no hair. Those are not the reasons &gt;&gt; that we're attracted that we're captivated by that person. The prophet makes it so clear. You're captivated because I see Christ in that young woman. I see Christ in that young man. And yes, I have an attraction to them. They are beautiful. And not always is it in the flesh, right? Character is so incredible. Character can make a average girl, I'm going to get in trouble for this, but character can make an average girl beautiful. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. And character will make a run-of-the-mill, you know, pugnosed, you know, two small ears, two big ears guy be the greatest husband ever on the face of the earth. Character will do that. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I'll tell you what age will do though. We won't even go there. Yeah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Yeah. So, Christ wants a bride. He wants a wife, not a girlfriend. &gt;&gt; And this wife is going to be so captivated by the revelation of him. &gt;&gt; That's exactly right. &gt;&gt; Now, let's get down to the root word of revelation. What is that? The revealing of him. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Not the idea of what he can give me. &gt;&gt; That's exactly &gt;&gt; what he can do for me. but who he really is. Amen. Being poured out. And this bride is being captivated by someone he can love. Even me. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. He cares about even me. &gt;&gt; He will save even me. He will heal even me. He will give even me a sound mind. He will come and do this even for me. Can someone say even for me? Amen. And he'll do this even for you. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. And she's captivated by that. Not by who she is. &gt;&gt; No, sir. &gt;&gt; No, sir. &gt;&gt; But who she is in him. &gt;&gt; That's exactly right. &gt;&gt; I come across a deal some time back. I had to read it out of curiosity. And the article was written, "Why do beautiful women marry ugly men?" Wouldn't that catch your attention to read the article? I mean, I'm just like, "Okay, I'm a sucker. I'm I'm hookline and sinker. &gt;&gt; Why Why do beautiful women?" And they weren't implying beautiful as in the sexy, flashy, whatever, but they were just talking about women with natural beauty. And it wasn't but a few days after I read that article, Sister Jerry and I are in town and uh it was the opposite. Here is this tall, very athletic-looking, handsome man. And I'm going to get in trouble for put saying it this way, but he was married to a wife who registered as 44, four feet tall, four feet wide. And I'm like, the children look like him and her. Yeah, that's definitely his wife. And he come back with some things in his hands in the store. Sis Sister said, "Well, Jerry's right here. This won't be so awkward." He comes back with some things in his hands down the aisle. I got these sweetheart and I thought this man is totally in love with his wife. &gt;&gt; He was I'm I I'm just describing, you know, here's this guy. He's like 6'2 or three, just well built, good-looking. And I thought, there it is. Why do beautiful women marry ugly men? You know what they summed the whole thing up? They could have used the prophet's words. Character. &gt;&gt; That's it right there. &gt;&gt; What that beautiful woman married him for was his character. &gt;&gt; Amen. And what that man married, that wife that I saw with my own four eyes. &gt;&gt; Character. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Want to drive this home. What does this bride see in her husband? &gt;&gt; Absolutely. &gt;&gt; Character. &gt;&gt; And what does the Lord Jesus Christ see in his bride? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Character. &gt;&gt; Amen. And amen. You see, my brother and sister, not the flashiest, not the smartest, not this, not that, but character. &gt;&gt; And imagine now &gt;&gt; when we're young, &gt;&gt; brothers, young men, &gt;&gt; we're too dumb to recognize what we're actually marrying. &gt;&gt; That make sense? &gt;&gt; We don't have a clue. &gt;&gt; Here's the girl here. Again, not to offend anybody, Sister Jared. just I didn't even figure out she was left-handed till we'd already said I do. Not that that would have stopped me from marrying her, but but then look at your life as you go on. There was something in you. The little boy eating the pedal off the bicycle, he didn't even know he needed sulfur, but he was looking for sulfur. And when you have a marriage that is sanctioned of God, you didn't even realize everything I'm deficient of. in the natural is in her. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And everything she's deficient of &gt;&gt; is in me. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Now, let's take this out into our spiritual relationship. The Lord Jesus wanted someone to love him. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; He wanted someone to look at him and say, "You're so beautiful. You're so wonderful." Someone who would give him praise and honor. He's not narcissistic. He's not egotistical &gt;&gt; no more than we love it when the Lord Jesus comes down and deals with us. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And he's expressing, "I love you." &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. I will give you even to the half of my kingdom. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; Go back, reread Esther. Read it from a different point of view. You'll realize God was laying out right in front of you and I our relationship with Jesus Christ. Approach me at any time. You've got half of my kingdom. What can I do for you? You ask this. Your position is given. &gt;&gt; Oh, my brother and sister, there's what God's doing. No, we get into this. I'm a Christian. I'm trying to serve God. I fail him. I'm hoping he he loves me. I hope he I don't lose I hope I don't &gt;&gt; Come on. Get over it. &gt;&gt; Get over your carnal self. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. Get to a place that you are captivated by your bridegroom. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. He's not getting rid of you. &gt;&gt; He's not going to forget that he owns you. Or well, I shouldn't use it that word, but he does have the title deed. Okay, so you'll understand. Amen. Forget that. It's a love affair. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Are we reciprocating? &gt;&gt; That's it. &gt;&gt; Are we in a love affair? &gt;&gt; Amen. That's Or are we just trying to be good little Christians towing a mark trying somehow to believe please a God that we think is judgmental &gt;&gt; that called us to watch us fail called us to watch us fall. &gt;&gt; That's not my God. &gt;&gt; He's captivated with you. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And we should be captivated with him. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. Brother Alex, save me. Help me. Amen. Now, I'm going to do a complete shift here if you don't mind. Um, super sign. The age that we live in, such an interesting thing. United States is now attacking Venezuela because they have drugs on a boat. They've had drugs on boats for 40 years. &gt;&gt; Yeah. Right. &gt;&gt; Why now? &gt;&gt; There's rare earth minerals. There's oil &gt;&gt; influence. And Putin stands up and says, "I won't put up with it. &gt;&gt; We will stop that." those dreaded communists. Oh my saints. I can give you a 1-800 number a company that makes bunkers. If you got enough backyard, you can have a bunker in your backyard. Or we could read this quote and see really what we need to worry about. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And you people, I've got to say this. Don't you let anybody poke something down your back about communism. Communism is nothing. Amen. &gt;&gt; It's just a tool in God's hands. &gt;&gt; That's it. Amen. That's right. &gt;&gt; Oh, Mr. Trump, the last Trump, he's going to save America. No, I'm sorry. He's just a tool &gt;&gt; in God's hands. I want any Bible reader, any prophet to stand and show me where the Bible ever says that communism will rule. &gt;&gt; It isn't communism that's going to rule. It's Romanism that's going to rule. According to the Bible, let me say this in closing. There's three great curtains today. One of them is the iron curtain. The other one is a bamboo curtain. So, we we see here uh Russia iron curtain. China bamboo curtain. Amen. And the other one is a purple curtain. You wash that one. That's the one that's going to rule. Can't you see the whole thing facing right into it? the church getting unless there comes a falling away, &gt;&gt; the man of sin can't reveal himself. &gt;&gt; Look what God's doing. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Saints, don't be worried about you. Oh, I'm not a good enough Christian. Just be a Christian. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; God will place in you. The word already says that he's given every man their measure of faith. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. Don't sit here and say, "If I just had more faith." Just say, "Lord, let the faith that's already in me. Lord, let that faith come out. Let it be expressed. Let that faith come alive in me cuz it's already in me. &gt;&gt; I'm not out here searching for faith. I need to search for a position where I can humble myself before the Lord and he will reveal himself." &gt;&gt; That's right. Amen. That's right. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; That's right. The church getting unless there come a falling away, the man of sin can't reveal himself. The communists, the lukewarmness of the church, the insignificant walk around God have mercy. Said in that day, he'd send a super sign among them. Amen. A super sign. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Wow. You know, we need to all run off in the desert. You see how how old this story is? You guys need to come with me now. If you trust Brother Paul, we've got to go live out here in the Aahes in the desert, and that's the only place God's going to meet us. &gt;&gt; Oh, no. Let me gather this crowd. We're going to go over here and live in this wilderness. No, sir. No, sir. God said, "I want you to go right down in the middle." Look at the Apostle Paul. He could have run and he hid. And instead, he let himself be taken right down into Rome. &gt;&gt; Amen. because he knew he could live and shine and overcome. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; In the midst of Rome. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Amen. Said in that day he'd send a super sign among them. He'd call a people for his name's sake. That's it. &gt;&gt; There's the super sign. Oh my brother and sister, that calling, &gt;&gt; Amen, &gt;&gt; of those people for his name's sake. You are the reflection of a super sign. that has come to pass. &gt;&gt; Not a doctrine to run to a wilderness with, but the word being made known and a people who are being brought into a state of complete adoration, complete love, being completely captivated by the word for this hour. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. We can go back and study what Paul said. Brother Brandham says, "I'm preaching what Paul preached." But brother Brandham actually expounded what Paul preached. Amen. He didn't have a new gospel, but he expounded it. Amen. You know, after all, the atom, you know, the cell has always been with us. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; But one day, they revealed it. &gt;&gt; That's it. &gt;&gt; The seed gene of Jesus Christ has always been with us. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; And now it's being revealed. &gt;&gt; Amen. Let's stand. God bless you. Thank you for your patience this morning. Hopefully, I wasn't too excited. Amen. I still have a whole bunch to preach here. I was going to preach the 27th Psalm all over again and make it real for our day right here. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. That we could stand here and not read it as a scripture, but read it present tense. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; The Lord is my light. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And my salvation. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Whom shall I fear? &gt;&gt; That's it. &gt;&gt; We could go through it, but you can take it home. If you believe in homework from church, just take it home, reread it, put yourself directly in there. Amen. Let it be real to you today. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Absolutely right. &gt;&gt; God bless you, saints. Amen. &gt;&gt; 24 brother Isaac, peace of God, cover me. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Aren't you glad? Hallelujah. Peace of God, cover me. Oh, cover me. Cover me. Just let him cover you today. Peace of God, cover me. All through the storm. &gt;&gt; Yes, Lord. &gt;&gt; Oh, cover me. Peace of God, cover me. Oh, cover me. Cover me. Peace of God, cover me. Oh, through the storm. Oh, cover me. Only in you I am saved. Only in you I'm secure. Only in you I find peace. So cover me. Just let the Lord know that your heart cover me. Cover me when I am hurting. Cover me when I'm not strong. Cover me when I am going through the storm. Cover me when all seems hopeless. Cover me when my faith is gone. Let the peace that passes all I understand. Cover me. Oh, cover me when I am hurting. Cover me when I'm not strong. Cover me when I am going through the storm. &gt;&gt; Cover me when all seems hopeless. Cover me when my faith is gone. Let the peace that passes all I understand. Cover me. Cover me. &gt;&gt; You know what it's saying? Lord, I just need you to cover me all the time. &gt;&gt; Amen. 890. Brother Isaac. Amen. Hallelujah. You know, as I was studying this thought, this song took on a little more meaning to me. &gt;&gt; Amen. Right. That's exactly right. &gt;&gt; When I grow cold, &gt;&gt; you ever have that time? It's like you get up in the morning, it's like, I need to read my Bible. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; I'll read it at lunchtime. &gt;&gt; That little iceberg &gt;&gt; Uhhuh. floating in there saying, "It's not important enough to do it now." &gt;&gt; That's exactly right. &gt;&gt; I'll do it later. &gt;&gt; But you know, lunchtime comes, the wheels have fallen off the wagon, the cows jumped over the fence, and you're laying your head on the pillow. I didn't read my Bible. Oh Lord, my heart can grow. Oh, so far away and cold. And yet for me, your love. Aren't you glad of that? Hallelujah. Lord, I bend my knee. Oh, in awe and fear of thee.
