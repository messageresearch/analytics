[34:28] [Music]
[34:42] who
[34:43] is all my righteousness
[34:46] [Music]
[34:58] well i just want to start
[35:01] by saying thank you
[35:03] um
[35:06] the gifts are wonderful
[35:10] but
[35:10] i just have to tell you saints
[35:13] the love of the body
[35:15] is much more precious to me than the
[35:17] gifts
[35:19] to
[35:20] to be able
[35:22] as it is with my brothers and sisters to
[35:25] have such a
[35:28] a unity
[35:30] a camaraderie as it were
[35:32] that we can literally stand and say
[35:36] we are by the grace of god becoming one
[35:38] body in jesus christ
[35:41] and that is very special to me and as i
[35:43] spoke to you last night those short
[35:46] words
[35:47] truly saints our whole reason and
[35:50] purpose of being
[35:53] is to come into that fellowship with our
[35:55] lord jesus christ amen no other to names
[35:58] to be lifted up no creation of
[36:01] great
[36:02] uh kingdoms and and things and uh
[36:06] truly i believe that we are together on
[36:08] that and so i say once again from sister
[36:10] jerry and i thank you so much
[36:12] and um
[36:14] you know
[36:16] thank you brother trevor for the kind
[36:18] words
[36:21] i i was visiting
[36:22] with a brother here a few days ago and
[36:25] i just want to be honest i don't want i
[36:27] don't want to you know just create a
[36:29] false image and the brother was sharing
[36:31] with me a situation that went through
[36:33] their church and
[36:34] as a pastor he says brother paul he said
[36:36] i had to repent before the lord because
[36:38] i just got angry
[36:41] at those individuals for what they were
[36:42] doing
[36:44] and i thought
[36:45] lord i'm not exempt from that there's
[36:47] there's times that you get frustrated
[36:49] and you do that but
[36:52] brother adam's kind words
[36:54] i'll just tell on brother adam
[36:57] many many many years ago we were doing
[36:59] some work together and
[37:01] we were fighting
[37:06] brother adam looked at me in total
[37:08] disgust and said you're emotional more
[37:10] emotional than any woman i ever met
[37:17] you see there's a side to us that we
[37:18] have to deal with
[37:22] but by god's grace
[37:24] we can project the life of jesus christ
[37:28] and in our good days and our bad no
[37:30] insult sisters
[37:32] but
[37:33] you know sometimes we live in our own
[37:36] little roller coaster
[37:37] and uh all i want to say is is thank you
[37:42] for your obvious grace and mercy
[37:45] that you give back
[37:47] because i doubt if there's a one here
[37:49] that
[37:50] hasn't watched brother paul on the
[37:52] roller coaster
[37:54] i remember an unnamed person in this
[37:56] church
[37:57] one time
[37:59] made a comment to me after a service he
[38:01] goes brother paul
[38:02] things are tough
[38:05] things are difficult and i said uh well
[38:08] you know the big bold man well uh he
[38:11] goes no i could tell by the way you
[38:12] preach today
[38:14] you're having problems
[38:17] and
[38:17] you know we you realize that we are just
[38:20] human
[38:22] but by god's grace we can come together
[38:24] and as grace abounds in the church my
[38:27] brother and sister to whom much grace
[38:29] has been given
[38:31] much grace is bestowed in i say the lord
[38:34] has been so gracious to me has been
[38:37] gracious
[38:38] uh beyond measure
[38:41] in my life and i just pray god
[38:43] disappoints each and every one of us
[38:45] that if you have a decision and we'll be
[38:47] talking today a little bit on this
[38:50] you have a decision to make
[38:53] offer grace amen offer the olive branch
[38:57] as it were
[38:58] and uh this judgment my brother and
[39:01] sister when meated
[39:03] unwarranted is harsh
[39:06] but love
[39:08] i hope you catch this
[39:10] but love given when we don't believe
[39:12] love should be given
[39:14] is called grace
[39:16] amen thank you lord for grace
[39:19] hallelujah
[39:21] so thank you very much for for the
[39:23] lovely time yesterday
[39:25] i have to admit i was with brother adam
[39:28] as he was the first one that was bumped
[39:30] out of your little
[39:31] uh cake walk
[39:33] and uh i caught a revelation right then
[39:35] and there from brother adam i was like
[39:37] i'm next
[39:40] and uh so i made a much better spectator
[39:43] than i did a participant
[39:45] and especially when i got to see the
[39:47] brother start knocking it down and
[39:49] pulling the chair out and some of those
[39:51] little
[39:52] uh i won't call him aggressive but um
[39:55] anyway
[39:56] please pray for aaliyah sister jolene
[39:59] and leah went home malia just
[40:01] here this morning and all of a sudden
[40:02] not feeling well and
[40:04] got to pray with her on this step there
[40:06] but she still
[40:08] uh just um i think had a very severe

[42:04] yesterday as the ministry or pastor
[42:06] appreciation and the ministry of the
[42:08] church
[42:09] but one portion of the ministry of the
[42:11] church that didn't get celebrated
[42:13] yesterday and um um because they're
[42:18] minimalists we didn't buy them any gifts
[42:20] we didn't
[42:21] uh figure that they would need anything
[42:23] more than what they have now but
[42:26] uh i just uh want to say thank you to
[42:28] brother jason
[42:30] and sister emmy
[42:32] amen
[42:33] and uh
[42:35] brother sean
[42:36] uh for their contribution to this
[42:39] assembly and i was just joking about not
[42:41] getting them something uh that please
[42:44] just take that as humor
[42:47] but um you know
[42:49] they make a great difference
[42:51] and every brother that has i mean let's
[42:53] just look at this when we think about
[42:55] ministry uh the brothers in the sound
[42:58] booth uh brother alex um translating uh
[43:02] brother mason
[43:03] i know where's mason
[43:05] he's sick okay
[43:07] okay
[43:08] well brother mason how's it just a
[43:10] desire and starting to work in the sound
[43:12] booth brother alex working in the sound
[43:14] booth
[43:15] each and every one doing their part
[43:18] is what contributes to this as a little
[43:21] group of people
[43:23] and uh and god has blessed us and so i
[43:26] say brother jason sister emmy sean
[43:28] god bless you for your your efforts um
[43:32] um i yes
[43:38] [Applause]
[43:40] now i don't i don't want to say this
[43:42] wrong
[43:42] but i i just want to share this
[43:44] perspective that sometimes you don't see
[43:47] there's been many a wednesday night that
[43:49] brother jason
[43:50] has come into the office i'm telling on
[43:52] it and he's come into the office and he
[43:55] has sat down in the chair
[43:58] looked over at me
[44:01] paul
[44:02] i'm bagged
[44:05] i don't know if i have enough strength
[44:06] to lead songs
[44:09] and then he comes out here and saints
[44:10] this is not showmanship
[44:13] but there's an anointing comes and the
[44:15] man who walks out that door on that
[44:17] wednesday night and stands right here
[44:19] you would have thought that he would all
[44:21] day was doing spiritual calisthenics
[44:24] preparing himself for the service
[44:26] praise the lord i'm gonna you know
[44:29] why because he just put the flesh behind
[44:31] him
[44:32] he said lord i have a duty to do
[44:35] so as we have
[44:36] musicians and song leader
[44:38] and whatnot that do this i i just want
[44:41] to say this to you young people um
[44:44] i'd be really happy to add your name to
[44:46] the list
[44:47] of those that contribute
[44:50] some of you
[44:52] know how to play instruments and for
[44:54] some reason
[44:56] or anointed of a spirit
[44:58] not to
[45:02] no i'm not just speaking to heidi i'm
[45:04] speaking to vika
[45:05] and
[45:06] donna
[45:08] whoever might be gifted in that fashion
[45:11] uh we were here recently
[45:15] in a house i won't say whose house but
[45:18] the piano is being played and some
[45:20] brothers and sisters are gathered around
[45:23] and they were singing so beautifully and
[45:26] i
[45:27] i didn't really look to see who was
[45:29] singing or
[45:30] all of this but i thought man i wish
[45:32] they would come to our church
[45:41] you know it'd be just so awesome if
[45:43] you know they didn't have a visitor
[45:45] spirit and would just think this is my
[45:47] church and i would sing and no i don't
[45:49] think i'll call him out brother jason
[45:51] but
[45:52] anyway so god bless you saints we love
[45:54] you so much sister sophie so glad to
[45:56] have you back uh we were missing you
[45:59] amen and uh so uh yes welcome home
[46:04] amen god bless you
[46:06] saints before we get too
[46:09] forgotten of what i'm doing here let's
[46:10] just stand and go into the word of god
[46:12] today um you know i preached this last
[46:15] wednesday and it really you know i felt
[46:18] led to preach that sermon but really
[46:21] it was kind of meant to be a sunday
[46:23] service and so those of you who weren't
[46:26] here wednesday i'm preaching part two to
[46:28] a service you never heard
[46:30] uh but i just want to continue on in
[46:34] this thought of the power to lay down
[46:36] and uh god has just given to us saints a
[46:40] supernatural ability uh in the hour that
[46:43] we live in you know the prophet of god
[46:46] speaking he's talking about it would be
[46:48] an age of rights that the people would
[46:50] declare i'm an american i have rights i
[46:53] i'm this i have rights and the prophet
[46:55] of god declares that as a christian we
[46:58] lay our rights down
[47:01] amen and we take up the calls of jesus
[47:03] christ and what he says and what he
[47:06] guides
[47:07] we are happy with we can say lord thank
[47:09] you because we just simply desire to be
[47:12] in his perfect will and so it's in this
[47:15] that i i want to continue in this spot
[47:18] and for a title today uh
[47:21] i uh i would have to say there were
[47:23] several thoughts that come to my heart
[47:25] but i just in reading the word i just uh
[47:28] come forth and and for a title today i
[47:31] want to speak on yielded vessels
[47:34] so
[47:35] it takes
[47:36] very much a yielding to the holy spirit
[47:40] not to determine
[47:42] that we know best to know that we can
[47:45] give ourselves fully to the word of god
[47:48] now saints you know
[47:50] two thoughts in the world we live in
[47:52] today
[47:53] and uh in that you know those two
[47:56] thoughts uh are very parallel right so
[47:59] the prophet of god shows us how that the
[48:02] wheat and the tares dwell together very
[48:04] parallel life they rejoice when it rains
[48:07] they suffer as it were in the drought
[48:09] they're drawing their their uh nutrition
[48:12] and they're drawing their needs from as
[48:14] it were the earth and so all this
[48:16] parallel but in that vein
[48:19] what the yield is
[48:21] one is gathered into the garner
[48:24] and one is gathered and burned
[48:26] so in these
[48:28] two thoughts or two veins entirely
[48:31] different results comes from that all i
[48:34] can say today is lord i am wheat i
[48:37] confess i'm wheat i will live like weed
[48:39] i will walk like we i will talk like
[48:42] wheat
[48:43] amen because that's
[48:45] by revelation who i am
[48:48] amen
[48:49] so let's go to luke the 12th chapter
[48:52] and uh verses one through five
[48:55] uh and by god's grace today we will we
[48:57] will be able to present this in a timely
[48:59] manner
[49:00] uh i had much more scriptures i had much
[49:03] more quotes but just felt led to
[49:06] by the grace of god i believe
[49:09] we chose correctly to condense it down
[49:12] because you know
[49:15] we can take
[49:16] and certainly sometimes it's necessary
[49:19] to drive the point home but
[49:21] you know saints almost want to ask you
[49:22] as believers how many scriptures do you
[49:25] need
[49:26] to convince you you're the bride of
[49:28] christ
[49:30] we could come and give you hundreds
[49:33] or as believers
[49:35] we could look at those few
[49:38] scriptures and realize that is me
[49:42] because the preponderance of scripture
[49:46] may be taken
[49:47] and say i have overwhelming evidence but
[49:50] did you know to a real believer
[49:53] one simple portion of scripture is
[49:55] enough
[49:56] to convince you this is the truth
[50:00] some people say i need more evidence i
[50:01] need more evidence i need more evidence
[50:03] but the real believer
[50:05] says
[50:06] i know what the spirit of christ is it's
[50:08] anointing me i'm living in that and and
[50:11] therefore we don't have to have some
[50:13] great
[50:14] ream of evidence to convince us of who
[50:17] we are
[50:18] amen luke the 12th chapter
[50:21] in the meantime when there were gathered
[50:23] together an innumerable multitudes of
[50:26] people and so much that they showed one
[50:28] upon another almost sounds like a riot
[50:31] he began to say unto his disciples first
[50:34] of all beware ye of the leaven of the
[50:37] pharisees
[50:38] which is hypocrisy
[50:41] for there is nothing covered
[50:43] that shall not be revealed
[50:46] neither hid that shall not be known
[50:49] therefore whatsoever ye have spoken in
[50:52] darkness shall be heard in the light and
[50:55] that which you have spoken in the ear in
[50:57] closets shall be proclaimed upon the
[51:00] housetops and i say unto you my friends
[51:04] be not afraid of them that kill the body
[51:07] and that after have no more that they
[51:10] can do
[51:11] but i will forewarn you whom you shall
[51:14] fear
[51:15] fear him which after he hath killed
[51:18] hath power to cast into hell
[51:20] yea i say unto that you
[51:23] fear him
[51:24] heavenly father we ask for your guidance
[51:26] today father you know my heart my prayer
[51:29] we just ask you to come move in our
[51:31] midst today lord let the word of god be
[51:33] so real to us
[51:34] we walk out today lord in our hearts
[51:36] being able to say was it not good to be
[51:39] in the house of the lord today
[51:41] lord every need you know into the very
[51:44] deepest of our person
[51:45] father what our hearts cries are what
[51:48] our needs are we ask you father
[51:50] lord as your saints reach out to you
[51:52] today to express their praise their
[51:54] worship and their needs lord that you
[51:56] would meet them in their place
[51:58] lord we thank you for your grace and
[52:00] mercy amen you may be seated
[52:05] now i'm going to take today's saints by
[52:08] god's grace and
[52:09] we're going to use this scripture and
[52:12] oftentimes uh we'll read a scripture and
[52:15] we'll take it and maybe correctly so
[52:18] we'll take it in a certain fashion but
[52:20] you know i want to just make an emphasis
[52:23] today if i may upon these scriptures
[52:27] we'll look at the parallels that there
[52:29] are between what god is doing in our
[52:31] lives and what satan is trying to do
[52:34] you'll see that in that that satan has
[52:36] nothing original right and so it's there
[52:39] that he is following and and i could
[52:41] just be so redundant with a list of
[52:44] these things that we see going on in the
[52:47] world today that are coming over in the
[52:50] natural reflecting a spiritual light
[52:53] i have spoken to you uh many occasions
[52:56] of the identity crisis that is taking
[52:59] place in the world today uh men and
[53:02] women don't know what gender they are
[53:04] people are identifying in all forms and
[53:06] fashion but my brother and sister the
[53:08] real root of that comes right down in
[53:10] this parallel because the world today
[53:13] wants to be christians my brother and
[53:16] sister they truly do they want to be
[53:18] christians but there's an anointing that
[53:20] is there that they cannot see the light
[53:22] and that's why we as sons and daughters
[53:24] of god should rejoice that god has
[53:26] opened our eyes amen so they are there
[53:29] and end up under this anointing of the
[53:32] age that we're living in it's not the
[53:34] person never look down upon that person
[53:36] because my brother and sister without
[53:38] the holy ghost falling on you and i we
[53:41] would be in that same exact boat but
[53:43] there they are under this identity
[53:46] crisis
[53:48] saying oh we are holy ghost-filled
[53:50] christians but yet there is so many
[53:52] things and this is not judgmental this
[53:54] is just dealing in the realm of fact so
[53:56] many things that do not line up with
[53:58] scripture but the spirit of the age has
[54:01] come in such a fashion that they have
[54:04] been a given permission to discount
[54:07] portions of the word of god because it's
[54:10] not relevant to our day so as they look
[54:13] at the bible they see it now as a
[54:15] historical book because if you can't
[54:18] take those portions of scripture and
[54:20] apply it today then that means it didn't
[54:22] apply
[54:24] but the word of god jesus christ the
[54:26] same yesterday today and forever john 1
[54:28] and 14 my brother and sister the word
[54:30] was made flesh and dwelt among us and
[54:32] he's the same yesterday today and
[54:34] forever so there is no expiration date
[54:39] on the word of god
[54:41] so you see because the reason i say
[54:43] there's no expiration date i hope you
[54:44] catch this now because if there was an
[54:47] expiration date on the word of god then
[54:49] satan could just delay and wait till the
[54:52] word
[54:52] expired
[54:56] because what do you do with something
[54:58] expired
[55:00] i watch my dear wife sometimes you know
[55:03] kind of with a little regret say oh you
[55:05] know i thought we would eat this
[55:08] but because it's been in the fridge too
[55:10] long or whatever it might be
[55:12] with regret right over to a garbage can
[55:16] so the devil you just wait wait and wait
[55:18] and wait right it's not how the word
[55:19] works my brother and sister the only one
[55:21] that controls that is god
[55:24] amen so what satan's trying to do
[55:27] in our life my brother and sister is
[55:29] always
[55:30] an imitation of what god is already
[55:33] doing on the earth
[55:35] and so you start to find yourself in a
[55:37] circumstance where satan is is is uh
[55:40] messing as it were i'll just put it that
[55:42] simple messing with your mind messing
[55:44] with your life realize that just right
[55:47] next to you is the original is the uh
[55:50] the fulfilled word of god coming past
[55:53] right there next to you but satan often
[55:55] puts this and i mentioned it here in the
[55:57] church how that the us military now is
[55:59] working on this hologram stuff that
[56:01] literally could project an image that
[56:03] would look just like this pulpit and
[56:05] would look like a singular person behind
[56:08] it but there could be ten people here
[56:10] and they're developing this technology
[56:12] but i want you to understand now that's
[56:14] because when jesus christ looked at the
[56:18] true believers the bride of christ you
[56:20] know what he saw
[56:22] himself yes
[56:24] he didn't see a bunch of sinners he
[56:26] didn't see a bunch of losers he didn't
[56:28] see a bunch of people unworthy
[56:31] he looked at that and saw himself
[56:34] because it's his blood that covered us
[56:37] and his blood is you might say in
[56:39] essence part of his identity and so then
[56:42] he looks at you and i and all he sees is
[56:44] himself
[56:45] how beautiful that is so the world now
[56:48] is coming out and reflecting all of
[56:50] these things brother brown says you know
[56:51] that science had invaded god's
[56:53] laboratory
[56:55] so what satan's trying to do my brother
[56:57] and sister is just follow a very
[57:00] parallel pattern now the holy spirit
[57:03] moving in your life moving in my life my
[57:05] brother and sister is moving us into a
[57:08] transparent life
[57:10] see god doesn't want a bunch of
[57:11] believers that are very adept at hiding
[57:14] things
[57:15] he wants a group of believers that when
[57:18] they look and come face to face with the
[57:21] word the very first thing that they
[57:23] would do is say oh lord forgive me
[57:25] amen never trying to hide that now look
[57:27] at the anointing we won't go into that
[57:29] today but when you look at that whole
[57:32] picture of what happened in eden
[57:34] so as it is that adam is here in this
[57:38] position the serpent is there as it
[57:41] would be
[57:42] a court he's courting is what he's
[57:44] actually doing he's courting eve he
[57:46] didn't just come and say eve i'm going
[57:48] to cause you to fall i'm going to cause
[57:50] you to lose your place in the garden i'm
[57:52] going to cause you to lose this and to
[57:54] lose that so what he did is he courted
[57:56] her until she started to lose her
[58:00] transparency
[58:03] it didn't take place in just one moment
[58:06] so there had to come a time
[58:08] that eve walked
[58:10] in the garden
[58:11] with the lord god
[58:14] and she's hiding something
[58:16] in her heart
[58:18] now this is what's interesting about the
[58:20] plan of god saints you can't hide one
[58:23] thing from god
[58:24] so here is eve walking in the garden
[58:27] with the lord god right go back into
[58:30] genesis 3 you'll see how satan comes the
[58:33] serpent comes and what he does is he
[58:35] removes
[58:36] the lord god and reduces it down to just
[58:39] god which is impersonal
[58:41] and so now eve's starting to have an
[58:43] impersonal
[58:45] christian
[58:46] relationship
[58:48] there's god in heaven and we're down
[58:50] here doing our thing
[58:52] amen but now here's eve walking in the
[58:55] cool of the evening
[58:58] hiding something she's lost her
[58:59] transparency
[59:01] she's hiding something now this spirit
[59:03] my brother and sister now i'm not
[59:05] defending brother paul okay i just i am
[59:07] who i am and if i made mistakes lord
[59:09] forgive me and saints forgive me but
[59:11] this is where when it becomes so real to
[59:14] you that everywhere you look you see
[59:15] this see it's not about individuals it's
[59:18] about spirits amen and so you come now
[59:21] and as they were walking with the lord
[59:23] god because regardless of how satan
[59:26] presents him he is the lord god
[59:28] he'll never lose his position
[59:31] to a believer he is always the lord god
[59:35] even in our transgression in our sin in
[59:38] our lowest point of life he needs to
[59:40] remain the lord god
[59:43] and so as we're walking
[59:44] in the cool of the evening this spirit
[59:48] that is on eve where she is losing her
[59:50] transparency
[59:52] now that spirit my brother and sister
[59:54] slowly works in such a fashion that it
[59:57] comes over and starts to anoint adam and
[1:00:00] you say how do you know that brother
[1:00:01] paul
[1:00:02] because you see when it come into the
[1:00:04] cool of the evening one evening
[1:00:06] the lord god's walking through the
[1:00:08] garden
[1:00:09] adam
[1:00:11] where art though
[1:00:14] where art thou
[1:00:17] under a spirit of transparency
[1:00:20] adam and eve would have run to the lord
[1:00:23] and said oh lord god forgive us
[1:00:26] but under
[1:00:28] this veil that has now come upon their
[1:00:30] soul
[1:00:31] we're going to hide this
[1:00:34] we're going to hide what we're doing
[1:00:36] we're going to hide what we're thinking
[1:00:37] or etc
[1:00:39] i'm going to take the time to go into it
[1:00:42] but you look at that and see whatever it
[1:00:43] is it's there so losing that
[1:00:46] veil of transparency or that anointing
[1:00:48] of transparency
[1:00:50] my brothers and sisters what caused them
[1:00:51] to run and hide themselves so the holy
[1:00:54] spirit in our day is moving in the lives
[1:00:57] my brother and sister sons and daughters
[1:00:58] of god and i hope you can say amen to
[1:01:00] this and we are becoming more
[1:01:02] transparent each and every day we can't
[1:01:05] hardly go through a day of something
[1:01:07] that we've said or done or a behavior in
[1:01:10] action whatever it is that we're not oh
[1:01:12] lord forgive me i just can't even go to
[1:01:14] bed tonight lord forgive me
[1:01:17] because that is what god is desiring to
[1:01:19] do is bring us into a transparent life
[1:01:22] now my brother and sister it's the holy
[1:01:24] spirit
[1:01:26] it's simply that the holy spirit
[1:01:28] going back into the message you'll see
[1:01:30] where the prophet of god talks about
[1:01:31] that when that holy spirit that sweet
[1:01:34] spirit moves down upon you don't resist
[1:01:36] it
[1:01:38] repent
[1:01:40] isn't that beautiful
[1:01:42] amen i'm preaching to believers today
[1:01:44] amen but we still live in this present
[1:01:47] world
[1:01:48] and this present world is getting darker
[1:01:51] not lighter
[1:01:52] amen so you look at that what god's
[1:01:54] doing now is giving us a spirit to deal
[1:01:58] with our problems he is not leaving us
[1:02:00] anointed
[1:02:01] under a spirit of condemnation but he's
[1:02:03] bringing deliverance and uh thank you
[1:02:06] lord for that now my brother and sister
[1:02:08] as we've already kind of touched on this
[1:02:10] but uh just to come back satan anoints
[1:02:12] people to hide their transgressions
[1:02:15] and uh so in that uh satan uh anointing
[1:02:18] them to hide their transgression
[1:02:21] but look at this now
[1:02:24] the individual is hiding his
[1:02:25] transgression
[1:02:28] but just like in the court where they
[1:02:29] have the stenographer is that what they
[1:02:31] call that
[1:02:32] stenographer i know i wasn't saying that
[1:02:33] right
[1:02:34] the stenographer sitting over there it's
[1:02:37] pretty amazing i've been in court a
[1:02:38] couple times as a witness
[1:02:40] fortunately not being in that chair but
[1:02:42] just to witness that the person in that
[1:02:44] chair did it
[1:02:47] but that's what satan's doing scottish
[1:02:48] stenographer here and everything that's
[1:02:50] happening have you ever watched their
[1:02:51] fingers it's incredible
[1:02:54] and they're recording every word
[1:02:56] and even really good ones can put in
[1:02:58] parentheses things like they
[1:03:00] sighed because it has to be an accurate
[1:03:03] record
[1:03:04] of what took place
[1:03:06] and so while satan's anointing in the
[1:03:09] day we live in people are hiding their
[1:03:11] transgression satan's stenographer is
[1:03:14] over here recording every drop of it
[1:03:17] and he's like
[1:03:20] here's the evidence
[1:03:22] you did it
[1:03:25] and under that
[1:03:27] my brother and sister people then are
[1:03:28] like i
[1:03:30] i
[1:03:31] i don't want the church to know
[1:03:35] whatever it might be i'm not here to
[1:03:37] speak as it were in that but just to
[1:03:38] remind you of the world we live in so
[1:03:40] the devil is here anointing you amen who
[1:03:44] was it preached that said you know the
[1:03:45] devil's the one that anoints him to rob
[1:03:47] the bank and then the devil calls 9-1-1
[1:03:51] and here's the stenographer recording
[1:03:54] every last thing well people are like oh
[1:03:56] my it kind of scares me to think that
[1:03:58] that god's got a record of even our very
[1:04:00] thoughts well i tell you what if our
[1:04:02] thoughts got boom put on that wall or
[1:04:04] this screen right here a lot of us would
[1:04:06] be just like oh my goodness
[1:04:08] that you see by the blood of jesus
[1:04:10] christ you say oh my thoughts my
[1:04:13] thoughts my thoughts oh what lord help
[1:04:15] me but the blood of jesus christ
[1:04:19] isn't that beautiful so it isn't that
[1:04:21] we'll never have those thoughts that's
[1:04:23] it that's right but the blood applied
[1:04:26] quickly
[1:04:28] not after weeks and months and years but
[1:04:31] the blood applied quickly
[1:04:33] amen delivers us and satan's
[1:04:35] stenographer looks down there and
[1:04:37] they're like
[1:04:39] where did it go
[1:04:45] it's not recording
[1:04:47] the devil says but i heard it and i saw
[1:04:49] it and i'm going to bring it back to
[1:04:50] your remembrance and then you can say
[1:04:52] what's in that's it
[1:04:55] what's him
[1:04:57] that song song always disturbs my heart
[1:05:00] what sin
[1:05:01] are you talking about
[1:05:03] now look at this my brother and sister
[1:05:05] satan's keeping a good record to expose
[1:05:08] it at a later date that's what he wants
[1:05:09] to do he doesn't just keep this for for
[1:05:11] effort he wants to expose it at a later
[1:05:13] date he wants it to uh control people
[1:05:16] and i think right here in our midst
[1:05:17] there will be a few folks that'll say
[1:05:19] yeah i know i know what you're talking
[1:05:21] about brother paul the devil wants to
[1:05:22] come back and just beat me to death with
[1:05:24] my past but remember what sin
[1:05:27] now look i actually feel sorry
[1:05:30] i hope you can take this with a sense of
[1:05:32] humor this morning i actually feel sorry
[1:05:35] for politicians
[1:05:38] because look at what's happening in the
[1:05:39] world we're living in today my brother
[1:05:41] and sister
[1:05:42] they're running for an office they're
[1:05:44] running for a judgeship or this or that
[1:05:47] and all the way back to kindergarten
[1:05:51] somebody's dredging up
[1:05:53] every single thing they ever did i'm
[1:05:56] like how
[1:05:57] how do people
[1:05:59] how do they do that
[1:06:01] they don't know this guy's going to be a
[1:06:02] judge someday so it's like if he's going
[1:06:04] to be a judge i'm going to keep a record
[1:06:05] of his life they're just living
[1:06:08] what is it the word of god coming to
[1:06:10] pass
[1:06:11] god said whatever was done in darkness
[1:06:13] shall be shown in the light and whatever
[1:06:15] was done in street secret will be made
[1:06:17] known and so we're seeing this
[1:06:19] manifestation taking place in the
[1:06:21] natural my brother and sister that
[1:06:23] people doing and saying things i just
[1:06:25] watched the other day a little deal
[1:06:27] about some woman that's uh
[1:06:29] being put to uh to be a position in the
[1:06:33] uh
[1:06:33] uh uh biden administration and uh you
[1:06:37] know they're coming back and saying did
[1:06:39] you not say in 1978
[1:06:43] did you not say in 1985
[1:06:47] did you not and they're naming off all
[1:06:49] these dates and i'm like
[1:06:51] wow
[1:06:52] the devil keeps a good record
[1:06:56] but is it really the devil or the word
[1:06:58] of god being vindicated
[1:07:02] right it's there in that realm but god's
[1:07:05] word must come to pass
[1:07:07] amen do you understand where i'm
[1:07:08] standing
[1:07:09] so you look at that now
[1:07:11] they're anointed to transgress and then
[1:07:14] they're destroyed by the very evidence
[1:07:17] but look at the difference that our lord
[1:07:18] jesus christ has done yes there is a
[1:07:21] record but instead of the evidence
[1:07:24] destroying the individual the blood of
[1:07:26] jesus christ destroys the evidence
[1:07:29] amen and turns us sets us free i say
[1:07:32] thank you thank you thank you lord
[1:07:35] hallelujah now you know satan is the
[1:07:38] author of blackmail
[1:07:40] you see
[1:07:41] god's word has said yea
[1:07:44] thou has said
[1:07:46] and opens the door for forgiveness
[1:07:50] i'll just you know it's interesting this
[1:07:52] come to me and i was like well do i do i
[1:07:54] not do i do i knew i'm not i run out of
[1:07:56] daisies picking the petals off but i
[1:07:59] just want to just give you a little
[1:08:01] brief glimpse of how satan can come and
[1:08:04] try even in the life of a young man to
[1:08:07] to
[1:08:08] bind and control and uh this young man
[1:08:11] which happens to be me i worked in a
[1:08:14] feed mill when i was in high school and
[1:08:16] my dad had a pickup i believe i remember
[1:08:19] correctly it was a 1956
[1:08:22] uh chevy pickup and and you know when
[1:08:24] you drove that thing uh you know it
[1:08:27] sounds kind of dangerous i guess but if
[1:08:29] you wanted to stop you had to pedal the
[1:08:32] push the brake pedal two or three times
[1:08:34] kind of pump the brake have you ever
[1:08:35] drove something like that i want to stop
[1:08:37] there's a stop sign down yonder i'll
[1:08:39] start pumping the break now
[1:08:42] and so i was driving this this pickup
[1:08:45] and felt happy that my dad would let me
[1:08:47] drive it to school so i could have this
[1:08:48] after school job
[1:08:50] and one day i was all in a hurry and i
[1:08:52] run out after work and i jumped in the
[1:08:54] pickup fired it up and i backed up and
[1:08:57] as i'm backing out of the parking space
[1:08:59] i had kind of an afterthought i need to
[1:09:01] start pumping the brake and i didn't
[1:09:03] pump it quick enough and vehicles parked
[1:09:05] on the other side of this driveway i hit
[1:09:08] this car in the tail i busted the whole
[1:09:10] taillight out fortunately didn't do any
[1:09:12] damage to the actual car just busted
[1:09:15] their taillight out and now i want to
[1:09:17] bring this back of what i've spoke to
[1:09:19] you into the real sense because i'm
[1:09:20] speaking something from a first-hand
[1:09:22] basis the very first thing that come
[1:09:24] over me was to look around and see if
[1:09:27] anybody saw me sin
[1:09:29] [Music]
[1:09:32] and i didn't see anybody i put it in
[1:09:34] first gear i'm going
[1:09:36] i go home that night and it's troubling
[1:09:38] me it's troubling me it's troubling me
[1:09:41] but i'm thinking my daddy's gonna be so
[1:09:42] mad at me
[1:09:45] i go to school the next day i go to work
[1:09:47] the next day
[1:09:49] and there was a little guy that
[1:09:51] really in real life if a character was
[1:09:53] drawn of him you would say that looks
[1:09:55] like a ferret
[1:09:57] because that was his nature
[1:09:59] and after work he's like hey paul
[1:10:02] i want to talk to you i'm like hey what
[1:10:04] do you want
[1:10:08] i saw what you did last night
[1:10:11] i'm like
[1:10:15] somebody did see me sin
[1:10:18] are you with me
[1:10:24] 20 bucks a week
[1:10:25] i won't tell anybody
[1:10:30] well hello i only made 80 bucks a week
[1:10:36] and he says i'll give you a couple days
[1:10:38] to think about it
[1:10:40] and if not
[1:10:41] i'm telling on you
[1:10:45] i went home so troubled
[1:10:47] what do i do what do i do
[1:10:50] well
[1:10:51] you know we have terms like
[1:10:53] little man syndrome and things like that
[1:10:55] right that are reflecting of the nature
[1:10:57] of people
[1:10:59] my whole life
[1:11:01] i'm not proud of these things but my
[1:11:03] whole life i i've been anointed with
[1:11:05] this and somebody's like
[1:11:07] well we're going to pound your head in
[1:11:09] and
[1:11:10] this is i hope the unconverted paul
[1:11:14] and nature would rise up in me and say
[1:11:16] you're going to die trying
[1:11:19] now i say that i share that because i
[1:11:20] want you to see that
[1:11:22] something in me was saying i'm not
[1:11:24] letting this guy blackmail me
[1:11:27] after supper that night i sat down with
[1:11:28] my dad and i said dad i hope you're not
[1:11:30] upset with me but
[1:11:32] and i give him the whole thing and he
[1:11:33] says i am upset with you and i'm like
[1:11:35] i'm sorry i'm not i'm not upset with you
[1:11:38] that you had the accident i'm upset with
[1:11:40] you
[1:11:41] that you hid it from me
[1:11:45] are you with me since
[1:11:47] i said what do i do dad
[1:11:50] he goes what you will do is you will go
[1:11:52] to school tomorrow and then you will go
[1:11:53] to work tomorrow and before you're going
[1:11:55] to ask your boss because that business
[1:11:57] this business closed at the same time
[1:11:58] you're going to ask your boss for just a
[1:12:00] few minutes and you're going to walk
[1:12:01] over there and walk in the front door of
[1:12:03] that business and say who drives that
[1:12:04] little red car and then you are going to
[1:12:06] stand in front of that individual
[1:12:08] whoever they are and you are going to
[1:12:10] tell them the truth amen
[1:12:16] i walked in that business that day
[1:12:19] receptionist at the counter and i said
[1:12:20] um who drives the little red car
[1:12:24] receptionist looks at me
[1:12:28] well it's so and so
[1:12:31] could i have a moment and talk to him
[1:12:33] other eyebrow goes up
[1:12:35] yep
[1:12:37] the man comes out
[1:12:39] and i said sir i
[1:12:42] backed into your car yesterday and i got
[1:12:44] scared
[1:12:45] and i drove away
[1:12:48] and i sent him here today to take
[1:12:50] responsibility
[1:12:52] and he looked at me and he goes
[1:12:54] well thank you young man a little short
[1:12:56] guy i don't know what that has to do
[1:12:58] with it but
[1:12:59] [Music]
[1:13:01] little short guy
[1:13:03] and he looked at me
[1:13:04] i said thank you
[1:13:07] thank you so much
[1:13:09] and i was taken back by this gratitude
[1:13:12] that he is showing after i've smashed
[1:13:14] his car
[1:13:16] and he's like we had no money to fix it
[1:13:20] and i said i have no money to just pay
[1:13:22] you
[1:13:23] and he said i'll tell you what we do
[1:13:26] i'll take the car to a body shop
[1:13:29] and then you pay me just as much money
[1:13:31] as you can
[1:13:33] maybe even twenty dollars
[1:13:36] a week
[1:13:40] walked out of there no contract nothing
[1:13:42] more than a handshake
[1:13:44] and the man saying you know what this
[1:13:46] will be fine i can drive the car
[1:13:49] i never like this oh this is personal
[1:13:51] i'm sorry to take your time but i always
[1:13:53] saw you know you see a car driving down
[1:13:54] the road and they have red tape over
[1:13:56] your tail height
[1:13:57] and i was like lord i never want to be a
[1:13:59] person like that
[1:14:02] but when you realize
[1:14:03] that while i may never be that person i
[1:14:06] can call someone
[1:14:08] to be
[1:14:10] and that struck me deeper than being the
[1:14:12] one with red tape over my taillight i
[1:14:15] caused this person
[1:14:17] i caused this person to doubt jesus
[1:14:20] christ is alive and real and manifest in
[1:14:22] the church i caused this person to be
[1:14:24] upset i caused this person to maybe even
[1:14:28] doubt god's real exactly right
[1:14:31] that's worse than having the red tape on
[1:14:32] her own self
[1:14:35] that's right
[1:14:36] and i remember my daddy just a few days
[1:14:38] later he goes
[1:14:40] i shared with him that night and he goes
[1:14:41] you know son it's not right
[1:14:43] that man just had liability on his car
[1:14:46] only way to fix it would be out of his
[1:14:48] own pocket i remember my dad saying you
[1:14:50] know what son your mama and i talked
[1:14:52] about this and prayed about it
[1:14:54] the man gave me the the
[1:14:56] body shop deal and
[1:14:58] i took cash to him that my daddy loaned
[1:15:00] me
[1:15:01] and i laid it all out
[1:15:04] and you know fathers can be rough
[1:15:08] my dad said every dime of your paycheck
[1:15:11] is mine
[1:15:13] except for gas money
[1:15:18] no snickers no zingers no pepsi
[1:15:21] all the necessities of life are just
[1:15:23] gone
[1:15:26] my dad told me
[1:15:28] i hope you're catching the underside of
[1:15:30] this
[1:15:31] my dad told me he says
[1:15:32] sometimes
[1:15:34] when a lesson is painful
[1:15:36] is the only way we remember
[1:15:39] the lesson
[1:15:41] i want you to think about it our god
[1:15:43] makes no mistakes and have you ever had
[1:15:45] a painful lesson
[1:15:46] amen did you forget that lesson i say no
[1:15:50] amen so i'm back at work this little man
[1:15:54] i describe as a weasel
[1:15:56] comes after work comes up
[1:15:58] have you got money for me
[1:16:01] i said no
[1:16:03] and he said
[1:16:04] i'm gonna go tell them
[1:16:05] i said
[1:16:06] you're welcome
[1:16:08] you see the blood of jesus christ takes
[1:16:11] all shame
[1:16:12] takes the stain of our transgression and
[1:16:15] now the devil is free to run around the
[1:16:18] earth and say they were a sinner they
[1:16:20] were a sinner they were a sinner you're
[1:16:22] free satan just go ahead tell them i was
[1:16:25] a sinner
[1:16:27] but the blood of jesus christ has set me
[1:16:30] free
[1:16:31] hallelujah and i can walk in liberty now
[1:16:34] i don't care the man looked at me and he
[1:16:36] says what do you mean and i said i went
[1:16:39] yesterday or days before that wasn't
[1:16:41] actually yesterday
[1:16:43] and i told them myself
[1:16:46] the guy looked at me and just turned
[1:16:47] around walked off you see every bit of
[1:16:49] leverage
[1:16:50] that he thought he had you realize that
[1:16:53] would have been twenty dollars a week
[1:16:55] for like ever
[1:16:57] isn't that what the devil wants he wants
[1:16:59] to hold us hostage not for a week or two
[1:17:01] not for a time of here and there he
[1:17:03] wants to hold his hostage to emotion
[1:17:05] bitterness and resentments and all these
[1:17:07] kind of things forever
[1:17:09] but i'll tell you i'm not gonna be a
[1:17:11] hostage to the devil forever and i'm
[1:17:13] gonna go and say lord forgive me lord i
[1:17:16] have done wrong and i take possession of
[1:17:19] my failure and i committed to you lord
[1:17:23] i'm lifting my soul
[1:17:26] as the psalmist david said i'm lifting
[1:17:28] my soul to you oh god
[1:17:31] and of thy mercy i seek amen
[1:17:36] and it's gone amen
[1:17:38] hallelujah
[1:17:40] and you know it kind of changed my
[1:17:41] relationship with this little guy
[1:17:44] because he was constantly the one that
[1:17:46] just weaseled here and weaseled there
[1:17:49] and afterwards
[1:17:52] i hope you think i'm just being spiteful
[1:17:55] i hope you don't think i preach like
[1:17:56] this
[1:17:58] but after that we're working they used
[1:18:00] to bag a lot of grain in the afternoon
[1:18:02] right towards the end of the day
[1:18:03] and whatever hadn't went out is bulk
[1:18:05] cattle feed they instead of it spoiling
[1:18:08] or not spoiling but setting up and being
[1:18:10] immovable because had molasses with it
[1:18:12] they would put it in these 80-pound bags
[1:18:15] and we would be there and they just
[1:18:16] loved to make paul run the bagger and
[1:18:19] the reason that mattered is because you
[1:18:21] see them bags were these big coarse
[1:18:22] paper heavy-duty bags and the way you
[1:18:25] had to handle them when i first went to
[1:18:26] work there have sympathy for me on this
[1:18:28] one
[1:18:30] in one day the first day i ever worked
[1:18:32] there chewed every knuckle in my hands
[1:18:34] to blood
[1:18:35] and bags were so coarse over time you
[1:18:38] developed calluses you know calluses are
[1:18:40] good but they're not
[1:18:42] because the devil wants to form a
[1:18:43] callous on your heart because you become
[1:18:45] hardened but god wants to keep your
[1:18:47] heart tender
[1:18:50] and i remember just a few days after
[1:18:52] that
[1:18:53] i'm there running the bagger and
[1:18:54] actually i got to rejoice on it these
[1:18:56] young men i'm going to call you out
[1:18:58] gideon shawn
[1:19:00] brother alex
[1:19:02] exercising
[1:19:04] feel this
[1:19:06] well when you get older it's more like
[1:19:08] feel this
[1:19:10] but i was young once
[1:19:12] in that thing you're doing this
[1:19:14] repetitive
[1:19:15] 80 pounds 80 pounds 80 pounds
[1:19:19] and this little guy makes a comment
[1:19:23] and i resented it
[1:19:25] and i just turned to the rest of the
[1:19:26] guys that were working there and i said
[1:19:28] you know what he did
[1:19:30] i run into the car across the street
[1:19:33] and he tried to blackmail me and every
[1:19:36] one of these guys i worked with said did
[1:19:38] you drag him out to the railroad tracks
[1:19:40] and deal with him
[1:19:42] and the little guy from that day on
[1:19:44] never said one word to me always just
[1:19:46] kind of
[1:19:47] why
[1:19:48] i hope you see the type saints i've been
[1:19:50] set free
[1:19:52] this no longer bound me i knew this man
[1:19:56] had no control over me and we as sons
[1:19:59] and daughters of god do not have to live
[1:20:01] under condemnation we have been set free
[1:20:04] and we can declare to the world he made
[1:20:07] me a liar he made me an adulterer he
[1:20:10] made me a thief but i'm set free and
[1:20:13] i'll tell you what sons and daughters of
[1:20:15] god can look at the devil today and say
[1:20:17] you know what somebody ought to drag him
[1:20:20] out by their tracks
[1:20:22] amen because that's what he deserves
[1:20:25] because he's a liar a cheating a thief
[1:20:28] amen see what it is is the devil is the
[1:20:30] author of blackmail
[1:20:32] he's tried to keep our sins against us
[1:20:34] forever but i tell you thank you lord
[1:20:37] that our sins are in the sea of god's
[1:20:40] forgetfulness and they can't even be
[1:20:42] found amen
[1:20:44] and the sting of death
[1:20:47] hell and the grave is gone
[1:20:50] because he says
[1:20:52] you were once this brother trevor
[1:20:54] and you don't fight with him
[1:20:56] you're absolutely right
[1:20:58] trevor
[1:20:59] the old man
[1:21:01] used to be that
[1:21:03] but trevor
[1:21:05] the new birth
[1:21:07] in the spirit
[1:21:08] of oneness
[1:21:11] oh hallelujah
[1:21:13] under the spirit of oneness with god i
[1:21:16] am no longer identified as a sinner i'm
[1:21:18] now identified as bride amen oh
[1:21:21] hallelujah
[1:21:23] hallelujah
[1:21:25] so look at this real quick i need to
[1:21:26] hurry
[1:21:27] so in verse 2 it says
[1:21:29] there is nothing covered that shall not
[1:21:32] be revealed neither hid that shall not
[1:21:34] be known
[1:21:35] now i want you to look at this and we
[1:21:37] understand the context of the scripture
[1:21:39] here but don't think that i've lost the
[1:21:42] context but look at this my brother and
[1:21:44] sister
[1:21:45] nothing covered
[1:21:48] think about the word
[1:21:50] nothing covered
[1:21:52] that shall not
[1:21:54] to the bride of christ
[1:21:55] be revealed
[1:21:58] so there'll be people that will tell you
[1:22:01] this
[1:22:03] was for the prophet only
[1:22:07] it's not what my bible
[1:22:08] says my bible says
[1:22:12] in the last days
[1:22:14] the son of man
[1:22:15] shall be revealed amen
[1:22:18] the mystery
[1:22:19] of jesus christ i'm just paraphrasing
[1:22:22] the south the mystery of jesus christ
[1:22:24] shall
[1:22:26] be
[1:22:26] made known absolutely
[1:22:30] why would a minister of this message
[1:22:34] try to keep you
[1:22:35] from all of the truth
[1:22:40] see there's there's got to be an
[1:22:42] ulterior motive
[1:22:44] could it be they're anointed i'm not
[1:22:47] speaking against individuals
[1:22:48] could it be they're anointed
[1:22:51] and satan says if i
[1:22:53] can keep them from seeing
[1:22:56] all of the truth that's it then i can
[1:22:59] keep them
[1:23:00] bound up that's it
[1:23:03] but if they ever see all the truth
[1:23:06] i've lost everything that i could ever
[1:23:10] hold over them
[1:23:12] amen
[1:23:13] oh my brother and sister
[1:23:15] i say this to you again it's not my
[1:23:17] thought today but i say this again to
[1:23:20] you
[1:23:20] it's your job to take everything
[1:23:23] preached in this church back to the word
[1:23:25] of god
[1:23:26] don't let satan give you just a cloudy
[1:23:28] fuzzy little understanding the mystery
[1:23:31] of christ has been revealed amen he is
[1:23:35] being made manifest in the body of
[1:23:37] believers in the hour that we're living
[1:23:40] there'll be people with ideas you're
[1:23:41] leaving the prophet behind are you
[1:23:43] kidding me we would not have a clue
[1:23:46] except for god ordained him to preach
[1:23:48] that word and now we see the truth is
[1:23:51] that leaving him behind no that brings
[1:23:54] us to a place of the highest praise for
[1:23:57] him as a messenger to our day that
[1:23:59] brings us to the place of thanksgiving
[1:24:02] wailing in our hearts because god loved
[1:24:05] me so much he anointed a man to
[1:24:08] sacrifice
[1:24:12] to bring the word to me
[1:24:14] amen that's not leaving him behind
[1:24:17] that's
[1:24:18] placing him in his proper position
[1:24:21] that's us recognizing that without him
[1:24:23] amen
[1:24:24] just as it would be imagine all that
[1:24:26] paul preached that's it
[1:24:28] we cut from the bible
[1:24:33] i'm sorry i don't want my bible
[1:24:35] missing what paul preached
[1:24:38] because there's truth
[1:24:40] there's life there's deliverance there's
[1:24:43] invigorating power
[1:24:45] in this gospel
[1:24:47] and it was preached in our day as a
[1:24:48] living word
[1:24:50] not a historical word a living word
[1:24:52] i say thank you lord jesus
[1:24:55] hallelujah so the devil tries to cover
[1:24:58] up everything the word says you know
[1:25:00] everything that's covered is going to be
[1:25:01] revealed
[1:25:03] but i want you to also come and realize
[1:25:05] the devil's trying to hide
[1:25:07] this revealed word
[1:25:09] even today amongst us as believers right
[1:25:11] here in this assembly he would like you
[1:25:13] to not catch the very intrinsic value
[1:25:18] of the revealed word
[1:25:22] but when we find the value of the
[1:25:23] intrinsic word did you know oh i know
[1:25:26] i'm surmising here
[1:25:30] people tell you you can't put line upon
[1:25:32] line but even the prophet put it that
[1:25:33] way
[1:25:35] do you realize
[1:25:37] as i've said before i was heartbroken
[1:25:39] you guys didn't vote for my pie
[1:25:41] yesterday
[1:25:44] i didn't even get
[1:25:46] an honorable mention
[1:25:49] in fact
[1:25:50] i got no mention at all
[1:25:55] sister sarah was sure i bribed him
[1:25:59] i felt like sister sarah's pie
[1:26:01] spoke for itself
[1:26:06] what if sister sarah
[1:26:09] she won't tell me what's in her pie so i
[1:26:11] can't really name the ingredients
[1:26:13] but let's just say sister sarah made a
[1:26:15] pie and it needed one pinch of salt
[1:26:18] she put in two pinches
[1:26:22] she didn't put in a pinch at all
[1:26:26] would the pie be the same
[1:26:30] absolutely not
[1:26:32] i hope you can catch where i'm going
[1:26:36] god said
[1:26:37] sister nadia she keeps sitting on the
[1:26:38] front row i haven't got her cured yet
[1:26:41] but the word of god says sister nadia i
[1:26:44] know what you need and
[1:26:45] here's just a little pinch
[1:26:48] and sister nadia goes home and rejoices
[1:26:50] because god spoke to her heart not the
[1:26:52] preacher
[1:26:56] and for another one we needed a handful
[1:26:57] of this and another one of that and god
[1:27:00] knew exactly what he was doing now what
[1:27:02] if my brother and sister
[1:27:04] we just took this message of the hour
[1:27:06] and removed revelation from it
[1:27:10] we wouldn't even have a message
[1:27:13] we would be
[1:27:14] presbyterians and lutherans and
[1:27:16] pentecostals and catholics and
[1:27:20] that's it
[1:27:22] god knew
[1:27:23] i'll put that pinch in there for you
[1:27:25] that'll make this word real to you
[1:27:28] amen now i want to go to verse 3 real
[1:27:30] quick
[1:27:31] i honestly thought i would oh man i'll
[1:27:33] be done so quick today
[1:27:35] and somebody's stole the time again
[1:27:38] therefore what you have spoken in
[1:27:40] darkness now we can look at this my
[1:27:42] brother and sister and there's different
[1:27:43] theologians they break this down in
[1:27:45] different fashions but i'm just going to
[1:27:47] take it as in darkness as in night and
[1:27:50] day amen not necessarily as spiritual
[1:27:53] but as night and day now it says
[1:27:55] whatever you spoken in darkness shall be
[1:27:57] heard in the light
[1:27:58] now if you can catch this we were just
[1:28:01] talking about it the other day there's
[1:28:02] things that god deals with your hearts
[1:28:05] and you come to church and the preacher
[1:28:06] reads that scripture he reads the same
[1:28:09] quotes that you're doing goes into the
[1:28:10] same message that you were listening or
[1:28:12] studying the very same thing what is it
[1:28:14] you sitting in as it were the dark night
[1:28:18] of your own house of your own life and
[1:28:20] thinking lord i don't understand and
[1:28:22] it's preached on you like lord i need a
[1:28:24] deliverance here an encouragement here
[1:28:26] and it comes forth what is this god
[1:28:28] revealing what was spoken in your heart
[1:28:30] in your private life amen revealing that
[1:28:33] i'm listening to you but it's never the
[1:28:36] negative like the devil it's never
[1:28:38] coming and saying oh sister
[1:28:40] what you thought or said
[1:28:42] i'm going to use against you
[1:28:46] always
[1:28:48] growth
[1:28:49] always grow amen
[1:28:51] the holy ghost never
[1:28:53] cuts down
[1:28:55] in the sense
[1:28:57] of the devil
[1:28:59] the devil destroys
[1:29:01] sometimes god has to dismantle things in
[1:29:03] our life can you say amen
[1:29:06] because it's not correct and he needs to
[1:29:07] correct that and bring it back but you
[1:29:09] know he always does that with loving
[1:29:10] kindness
[1:29:11] he always brings up with revelation that
[1:29:13] we understand i need to let go of this
[1:29:16] amen isn't god wonderful that's right
[1:29:19] amen
[1:29:20] so you look at this i want to just move
[1:29:21] on behind that beyond that which you
[1:29:23] have spoken in the ear in closet shall
[1:29:26] be proclaimed upon the housetops
[1:29:29] amen this is positive and negative
[1:29:32] saints amen and you know while all of
[1:29:34] this is happening there's a yielding
[1:29:36] taking place
[1:29:38] think about this there's a yielding
[1:29:40] taking place and whether it's positive
[1:29:42] or negative there's always a yielding
[1:29:45] taking place there's some people it's
[1:29:47] like well you know i've heard these
[1:29:49] words they've been spoke to me actually
[1:29:50] they weren't spoke to me they were
[1:29:51] thrown in my face
[1:29:55] you're preaching
[1:29:57] me
[1:29:59] well if you were sitting down there
[1:30:00] facing this direction i was
[1:30:03] right
[1:30:05] unless you would like us to act like you
[1:30:07] don't exist
[1:30:09] but this is deeper saints this is a
[1:30:10] spirit
[1:30:12] that's pushing back
[1:30:14] and say that's not of god
[1:30:16] you're preaching at me
[1:30:24] when
[1:30:25] we say god said
[1:30:28] now
[1:30:30] have any of you ever
[1:30:32] in your life made a statement in the
[1:30:34] nature of
[1:30:36] i was praying and the lord spoke to me
[1:30:41] do you know when you voice that you're
[1:30:43] saying thus saith the lord
[1:30:50] now if you're thus saith the lord is
[1:30:52] contrary to the written word of god
[1:30:55] nobody needs to judge that spirit it's
[1:30:57] obvious
[1:30:58] it's just plain and simple this is not
[1:31:02] the word
[1:31:03] so the revealed word cannot speak that
[1:31:06] because brother branham clarified he
[1:31:07] said god will never the holy spirit will
[1:31:10] never lead you away from the word it
[1:31:13] will always draw you to the word
[1:31:16] so then when someone says well the lord
[1:31:19] spoke to me and it is contrary to the
[1:31:22] word no one needs to judge that even
[1:31:24] i'm sorry saints no one needs to judge
[1:31:26] that it's the word judges that and the
[1:31:29] urum thummim would declare that wasn't
[1:31:31] true
[1:31:32] no flashing
[1:31:33] on the life
[1:31:35] on the life
[1:31:37] no flashing on the life
[1:31:39] because god cannot honor something
[1:31:41] that's contrary to his word so this
[1:31:44] yielding that's taking place my brother
[1:31:47] and sister is the spirit that's yielded
[1:31:49] to the word
[1:31:51] revealed word living word or
[1:31:54] revealed
[1:31:56] and anointed and manifesting
[1:31:59] a god of history
[1:32:06] did not our fathers
[1:32:09] and jesus turns right back on them it
[1:32:11] says you kill them
[1:32:13] and then you garnish their tombs yes sir
[1:32:16] right yes sir but they could stand and
[1:32:18] say are we not of abraham's seed
[1:32:21] are we not believers
[1:32:23] of the end time message
[1:32:26] you are
[1:32:28] if you
[1:32:30] yield to it that's it that's it but if
[1:32:32] there's no yielding to it it then
[1:32:34] becomes your cloak
[1:32:36] am i preaching too hard
[1:32:39] okay
[1:32:40] i just don't want your whole sunday to
[1:32:42] be ruined
[1:32:45] now romans 6 6
[1:32:48] 6 16. now look at this my brother and
[1:32:50] sister when you read the book of romans
[1:32:53] doesn't it give you a warm fuzzy feeling
[1:32:58] the roman church
[1:32:59] stood up and declared we believe the
[1:33:01] word for our day
[1:33:04] they had pool parties
[1:33:06] they had mixed bathing
[1:33:07] they even exchanged wives
[1:33:11] oh that's a stunner you all look like oh
[1:33:13] my goodness brother paul said that there
[1:33:14] was a pope in our church i can't believe
[1:33:16] that no it's the truth yeah and they did
[1:33:18] it all in the name of christianity yeah
[1:33:22] paul comes along and says
[1:33:24] god sent me here
[1:33:25] straighten you out amen i'm not here to
[1:33:28] make you feel good i'm not here to rub
[1:33:30] your back i'm here to tell you that that
[1:33:32] is wrong that is wrong that is wrong
[1:33:34] that is wrong and no doubt the romans
[1:33:36] must have thought do we do anything
[1:33:38] right
[1:33:40] he's
[1:33:41] preaching at us
[1:33:45] but there was some real believers that
[1:33:47] were there yes sir that voice amen
[1:33:50] that's the truth
[1:33:52] and
[1:33:54] preaching at us
[1:33:56] no he wasn't preaching with my flesh go
[1:33:58] go listen to one don't listen to oneness
[1:34:00] it's good
[1:34:01] this old byproduct flesh that wasn't
[1:34:03] what they were looking at amen they were
[1:34:05] looking down to the soul and they even
[1:34:08] then had a revelation that their soul
[1:34:10] belonged to god from the beginning and
[1:34:12] would belong to god at the finish
[1:34:15] and they chose by a yielding to
[1:34:18] reverence
[1:34:19] the call of the word amen and that word
[1:34:22] becomes so real to them no ye not that
[1:34:24] to whom ye yield yourself servants to
[1:34:26] obey
[1:34:28] his servants
[1:34:29] to whom ye obey whether of sin and to
[1:34:32] death or of obedience unto righteousness
[1:34:36] now this is going to be a little lap
[1:34:38] over i don't know the lord kind of laid
[1:34:39] on my heart and i haven't really moved
[1:34:41] forward on it but just maybe you can
[1:34:43] study and think about it the two sides
[1:34:45] of obedience
[1:34:46] it's right here based out of this
[1:34:48] scripture right here there's anointing
[1:34:50] of laodicea if you're obedient to it it
[1:34:52] yields one thing the holy spirit moving
[1:34:54] in this day you're obedient to it it
[1:34:56] yields something entirely different
[1:35:01] but god be thanked that ye were the
[1:35:03] servants of sin
[1:35:05] but ye have obeyed from the heart that
[1:35:07] form of doctrine which was delivered you
[1:35:11] being then made free from sin you became
[1:35:13] the servants of righteousness i speak
[1:35:16] after the manner of men because of the
[1:35:18] infirmity of your flesh
[1:35:22] the apostle paul declared i have a thorn
[1:35:24] in my flesh
[1:35:26] and history has said well it was it was
[1:35:28] because he was beaten we're pretty sure
[1:35:30] that this thorn was because he's beaten
[1:35:32] every other theologians say well we
[1:35:35] think it was his eyesight it's it's
[1:35:37] recorded in history that paul's eyesight
[1:35:39] was failing him but my brother and
[1:35:40] sister i want to take you into the realm
[1:35:42] of the spiritual now the physical
[1:35:44] infirmities that we have must be born
[1:35:47] god heals us
[1:35:50] but i personally let me put this note i
[1:35:52] personally
[1:35:54] think
[1:35:55] that paul
[1:35:56] was describing
[1:35:58] paul
[1:35:59] dealing with
[1:36:01] paul
[1:36:05] amen paul's seeking deliverance
[1:36:08] from himself that's right amen
[1:36:11] paul
[1:36:12] going through life
[1:36:16] just like you yeah amen
[1:36:20] and happened to say lord forgive me
[1:36:23] for my thoughts and
[1:36:25] my deeds and my actions and my words
[1:36:27] lord forgive me
[1:36:30] because i think it'd be much simpler to
[1:36:32] accept the fact that you're back
[1:36:34] you know some people said all you had
[1:36:36] you know maybe i forget what the term is
[1:36:38] not scoliosis but hunchback
[1:36:41] uh you know whatever the proper medical
[1:36:43] term others said this others say this
[1:36:45] others say it was eyesight i say it was
[1:36:47] a devil assaulting him yeah
[1:36:54] god be thanked that you were servants of
[1:36:56] sin but have obeyed from the heart that
[1:36:58] form of doctrine which was delivered you
[1:37:00] being then made free from sin you became
[1:37:02] the servants of righteousness i speak
[1:37:04] after the manner of men because of the
[1:37:06] infirmity of your flesh for as you have
[1:37:09] yielded your members
[1:37:11] see
[1:37:13] this is not talking about you poor guy
[1:37:14] with a club foot or you person here with
[1:37:16] this or that
[1:37:18] the infirmity of the spirit paul was
[1:37:20] dealing in the spirit realm
[1:37:22] if god was so much worried about their
[1:37:24] physical bodies my brother and sister
[1:37:26] god would anointed paul to pray for them
[1:37:28] and every one of them would have been
[1:37:30] healed but sometimes we need a physical
[1:37:33] infirmity to remind us
[1:37:35] [Music]
[1:37:36] to remind us
[1:37:41] for as you have yielded
[1:37:43] your members to uncleanliness and to
[1:37:46] iniquity unto iniquity even so now yield
[1:37:50] your members servants to righteousness
[1:37:52] unto holiness
[1:37:53] see so he's he's laying this down now
[1:37:56] we know what iniquity is
[1:37:59] we can put it anyways brother branham
[1:38:01] puts it like this he says iniquity is
[1:38:03] you knowing to do right and not doing it
[1:38:06] amen
[1:38:07] other definitions there's several of
[1:38:09] iniquity
[1:38:10] posts it under the realm of
[1:38:13] presenting yourself i'm paraphrasing
[1:38:15] presenting yourself as something
[1:38:17] you are not
[1:38:24] even so now yield your member servants
[1:38:26] to righteousness and holiness for when
[1:38:28] you were servants and you were free from
[1:38:30] righteousness some people say whoa i'm
[1:38:32] glad i was free from righteous but
[1:38:34] that's not the heart of the believer
[1:38:36] that's not the life of the believer the
[1:38:37] nature of the believer you crave
[1:38:39] righteousness
[1:38:41] amen
[1:38:43] hallelujah
[1:38:44] what fruit had ye then in those things
[1:38:47] whereof you are now ashamed
[1:38:49] isn't that right
[1:38:51] i tell you what i'll go into it but i
[1:38:53] can tell you i've talked to a lot of
[1:38:54] brothers in a lot of places on a lot of
[1:38:56] continents
[1:38:57] and men tell you maybe because you're a
[1:38:59] minister maybe because our friendship
[1:39:01] was such and men tell you
[1:39:04] of what they were before yeah and then
[1:39:07] tell you no one in this church knows
[1:39:10] no one in this church knows what i was
[1:39:12] before
[1:39:15] i was effeminate i was this i was that
[1:39:19] amen
[1:39:21] sister jerry and i met a brother
[1:39:23] back east
[1:39:25] in a prison
[1:39:27] hands this big
[1:39:29] man tries to stab him with some kind of
[1:39:30] chunk of metal
[1:39:32] he strikes the man down
[1:39:34] actually kills him
[1:39:36] struck him so hard the man hit a wall or
[1:39:38] whatever and that was the end of him
[1:39:42] did they look at that and say
[1:39:44] we're happy you defended yourself
[1:39:47] no he was already the outcast
[1:39:49] and they put the cuffs on him
[1:39:51] and led him away and charged him with
[1:39:53] murder
[1:39:55] see the spirit of laodicea doesn't like
[1:39:57] you
[1:39:59] and will fight against you and ever did
[1:40:01] but when he's all caught up his old
[1:40:03] pastor faithful oh brother
[1:40:05] he's like pastor they're talking about
[1:40:08] sending me to prison like a common
[1:40:10] criminal
[1:40:12] this pastor says you know what
[1:40:15] you just believe
[1:40:17] and watch god
[1:40:19] perform
[1:40:23] hallelujah
[1:40:25] the same couple i find it humorous can i
[1:40:27] share this humorous moment
[1:40:29] they come in church i'm preaching in
[1:40:30] this little church all
[1:40:32] all black church except for one white
[1:40:34] sister and
[1:40:37] this brother
[1:40:38] and his wife are sitting right here on
[1:40:39] the front row
[1:40:41] he's this great big guy like i said i'm
[1:40:42] not exaggerating hands this big
[1:40:46] and the whole service brother trevor
[1:40:48] he's sitting there with his arms crossed
[1:40:49] and every once in a while he'd nod his
[1:40:51] head
[1:40:54] and his wife had her hands in her lap
[1:40:57] clasped really tight and a couple times
[1:40:59] during the service a little amen come
[1:41:02] out and i thought well i don't know
[1:41:05] what's going on with them but praise the
[1:41:06] lord

[1:41:15] great big black brother and he just he'd
[1:41:17] start laughing

[1:41:29] service
[1:41:30] tonight puts his head down his wife
[1:41:33] sitting just right back

[1:42:08] pour the fruit of holiness into his
[1:42:11] bride and you are identified by the word
[1:42:14] today as his bride hallelujah

[1:44:15] jesus christ i am trusting the blood of
[1:44:17] my lord jesus christ and eternal
[1:44:20] predestination has declared i am his
[1:44:24] regardless of your accusation
[1:44:27] i don't have to answer you
[1:44:30] but look at this pilate says know us

[1:45:05] amen
[1:45:09] let me just bring a little reminder from
[1:45:10] wednesday night i want to bring a little
[1:45:12] more clarity here's job
[1:45:15] living his life godly life a prosperous
[1:45:18] life i even was going to bring a
[1:45:19] scripture to this morning out of the out
[1:45:21] of the bible that's talking about when i
[1:45:23] give thee wealth
[1:45:26] god will bless you
[1:45:28] joe sitting there in all his wealth his
[1:45:30] children all around him
[1:45:32] and the devil comes
[1:45:33] and says you know i torment him i tempt
[1:45:36] him but you got a hedge around him
[1:45:38] god doesn't say well i got a hedge
[1:45:39] around him because otherwise you know
[1:45:40] you just tear him up and throw him out
[1:45:42] and god says oh no no no
[1:45:45] no i've got a hedge around him but i'll
[1:45:47] tell you what i'll do
[1:45:49] i'll open the hedge
[1:45:51] and you can tempt him and try him you
[1:45:53] can do anything you want to him you just
[1:45:56] can't take his life i want to bring this
[1:45:58] clarity in case there was any
[1:45:59] misunderstanding on wednesday you see
[1:46:02] with that you can't take his life god
[1:46:05] put a hedge
[1:46:06] around the devil
[1:46:08] he just limited what the devil could do
[1:46:11] to job did he say you can't do this to
[1:46:14] him you can't do that to him you can't
[1:46:15] kill his children
[1:46:17] no he was talking
[1:46:19] because god the author of eternal life
[1:46:21] said i'll restore all the rest of this
[1:46:23] it's job we're talking about right now
[1:46:26] now look at that when god put that hedge
[1:46:28] around the devil he limited right i hope
[1:46:31] you guys can catch us he limited satan's
[1:46:35] authority
[1:46:36] [Music]
[1:46:37] while the devil still had a lot of
[1:46:39] liberty
[1:46:41] he brought job down to the point he even
[1:46:44] questioned
[1:46:45] who am i what am i doing here and why is
[1:46:48] this i serve god faith you must be a
[1:46:50] secret sinner
[1:46:51] no i tell you
[1:46:53] i guarantee you saints if we were there
[1:46:56] job didn't say no i'm not i can declare
[1:46:59] job said i am not a secret sinner
[1:47:03] i know my righteous life before the lord
[1:47:08] i hope you catch this
[1:47:09] it got to a point
[1:47:11] it's starting to ebb
[1:47:13] his spirit is declining
[1:47:15] he's under such a great burden even his
[1:47:17] own wife
[1:47:20] thank god for godly wives
[1:47:22] and even his own wife was like you know
[1:47:24] what maybe you ought to just curse god
[1:47:26] because you're a miserable wreck
[1:47:36] and then god speaks to him
[1:47:40] joe
[1:47:43] where were you there you are
[1:47:45] there you are where were you joe
[1:47:50] when all of heaven was rejoicing the
[1:47:52] angels were singing and all of this was
[1:47:55] taking place where were you joe
[1:47:58] hallelujah and you know job had a
[1:48:00] revelation of predestination my brother
[1:48:02] and sister because it stroke struck his
[1:48:05] heart and he said oh
[1:48:08] amen
[1:48:09] i've always been in you lord i always
[1:48:11] was a part of you i am a son of god
[1:48:15] where were you when the sons of god sang
[1:48:18] for joy and job cut a revelation and
[1:48:20] said i was in your presence
[1:48:23] that's where i was at because if the
[1:48:25] sons of god were gathered around you
[1:48:28] singing in the heavens i am a son of god
[1:48:32] i had to be there
[1:48:34] oh and it struck him deep in his soul
[1:48:36] and right there you see a change
[1:48:39] connected in the scripture you see it
[1:48:41] change job starts looking at this
[1:48:43] differently
[1:48:44] [Music]
[1:48:47] i've heard people condemned
[1:48:49] by their own words
[1:48:51] brother branham said don't speak the
[1:48:53] devil's language
[1:48:55] condemned by those words i'm not a very
[1:48:57] good sinner brother paul every time i
[1:48:58] feel like i just get raised up to do
[1:49:00] something seems like i get slapped back
[1:49:02] down to the ground
[1:49:03] well praise the lord
[1:49:04] that hedge around you didn't let the
[1:49:06] devil take your life
[1:49:08] and you will find deliverance when the
[1:49:10] day you can stand up and say i was a son
[1:49:13] daughter of god and i was there
[1:49:16] the israel of heavens all of the galaxy
[1:49:20] and all of that was there i was in his
[1:49:23] presence singing praise to him
[1:49:26] and when you come to that place when i
[1:49:28] come to that place the devil has lost
[1:49:31] his ability to accuse you
[1:49:34] oh but as long as we stay in flesh and
[1:49:38] live in flesh and think in flesh and
[1:49:40] worship in flesh we'll never catch the
[1:49:43] intrinsic eternal value of who we really
[1:49:46] are
[1:49:47] oh hallelujah
[1:49:49] hallelujah forgive me for getting
[1:49:51] excited saints
[1:49:52] oh hallelujah
[1:49:54] yeah look at this
[1:49:56] can we say this morning would you say
[1:49:58] with me our god is in control
[1:50:00] hallelujah
[1:50:02] amen
[1:50:04] i'll tell you the devil has to ask
[1:50:05] permission for everything
[1:50:08] we ever catch that my brother and sister
[1:50:09] it'll change our approach
[1:50:11] i'm closing right here this last quote
[1:50:14] it's only 72 paragraphs long
[1:50:17] he looked down he looked at his city
[1:50:20] talking about david and he remembered
[1:50:22] when he was a little boy
[1:50:23] he used to take the sheep out by this
[1:50:25] certain pool there
[1:50:27] it was a great great water country and
[1:50:29] also bread country known there really
[1:50:31] bethlehem means a house of god's bread
[1:50:34] and then when david remembered going by
[1:50:36] there and drinking that good cool water
[1:50:39] and here he was laying up here now a
[1:50:41] fugitive away from his own people he had
[1:50:43] no place to go
[1:50:45] i'll tell you what i feel like right now
[1:50:49] i feel like a fugitive from that out
[1:50:51] there
[1:50:54] i don't understand their humor
[1:50:56] i don't understand their reasoning i
[1:50:58] don't understand their behavior i don't
[1:51:00] understand their desires
[1:51:03] we're fugitives from that yes
[1:51:06] he had no place to go and his soul
[1:51:08] must have cried for that good cool water
[1:51:12] he had some servants there
[1:51:13] my just the least of his desire was a
[1:51:16] command and they three of them
[1:51:18] fought their way through that line of
[1:51:20] philistines 15 miles seven miles or
[1:51:22] something down and back cutting their
[1:51:24] way through and brought him a drink of
[1:51:26] that water
[1:51:27] but
[1:51:28] the soul first amen now look at this it
[1:51:32] expressed oh how long to drink of that
[1:51:35] water again
[1:51:36] and these men brother trevor
[1:51:38] we could make this happen
[1:51:40] come on
[1:51:42] pulled their swords
[1:51:44] left the safety of camp
[1:51:46] marched right through amen
[1:51:50] sometimes
[1:51:51] you have to just kind of work your way
[1:51:53] around the devil he's got his little
[1:51:54] centennials out
[1:51:56] sometimes you just have to stop and say
[1:51:58] lord
[1:52:00] this world's not my home
[1:52:02] father i just need you
[1:52:04] i need you lord
[1:52:06] and god just makes it happen have you
[1:52:07] ever had that happen yeah
[1:52:09] i'll tell you i i can i could take up
[1:52:12] your whole afternoon and evening to tell
[1:52:13] you of the things that god has done that
[1:52:15] i would declare to you is impossible
[1:52:20] soul thirst
[1:52:22] something greater than what his
[1:52:24] natural desire
[1:52:26] his body he was up there probably had to
[1:52:28] drink out of anything he'd get a hold of
[1:52:30] some old goat skins and things with some
[1:52:32] old hot water in there on a hot day and
[1:52:34] he thought if i could just lay down and
[1:52:36] quench this thirst that i have
[1:52:38] if i could just go down there to
[1:52:40] bethlehem and lay down by that spring
[1:52:42] and drink and when they went down and
[1:52:45] got the water and brought it back
[1:52:48] his soul thirst
[1:52:50] come on saints
[1:52:52] his soul thirst
[1:52:54] was greater
[1:52:55] than his natural amen amen
[1:52:59] now look at this
[1:53:01] brother bud southwick you know the story
[1:53:04] tried and tried and tried to quit
[1:53:06] smoking
[1:53:07] he just couldn't i know brothers that
[1:53:09] knew him personally
[1:53:11] and he'd tell him
[1:53:12] i would just make this declaration
[1:53:14] before god and you've done it too
[1:53:17] lord if you'll just deliver for me i'll
[1:53:19] never this i'll never that
[1:53:21] and it was there then he would find
[1:53:22] himself with this craving and maybe
[1:53:24] things were stressful and he was nervous
[1:53:26] and and he would find himself
[1:53:29] lighting a cigarette smoking it again
[1:53:32] and in his heart saying oh lord i'm
[1:53:33] sorry i told you i'd quit
[1:53:37] but the soul thirst my brother and
[1:53:39] sister amen
[1:53:40] wasn't dependent
[1:53:42] on this flesh
[1:53:43] [Music]
[1:53:45] and the day come
[1:53:47] we find that story with humor
[1:53:49] well
[1:53:51] brother bill
[1:53:52] i'll go up one last time and check the
[1:53:54] horses
[1:53:56] now look at this
[1:53:58] i want you to think about this
[1:54:00] go out of the tent
[1:54:06] go out here stand way over here behind
[1:54:08] the horses
[1:54:13] the smoke doesn't go to the tent it goes
[1:54:15] off over here
[1:54:16] that's called premeditation
[1:54:20] but beyond the premeditation of the
[1:54:23] flesh
[1:54:26] brother branham was anointed of the holy
[1:54:27] spirit my brother and sister that was
[1:54:29] not william branham a man standing there
[1:54:32] sitting there laying there that was the
[1:54:34] holy spirit amen brother bud
[1:54:38] when did you quit smoking
[1:54:42] well
[1:54:43] brother bill i haven't i've tried to do
[1:54:45] this but i guess i'm just destined to be
[1:54:47] a failure i can't do this i can't do
[1:54:49] this nobody was a catalyst
[1:54:52] a spark come down
[1:54:54] struck his
[1:54:56] soul
[1:54:57] why
[1:54:59] now if you can catch what i'm saying
[1:55:00] right here here's brother bud
[1:55:03] with his soul lifted up to the lord in
[1:55:04] one hand and a cigarette in the other
[1:55:07] does that make sense to you
[1:55:10] but his heart's
[1:55:12] cry his souls
[1:55:14] cry that's it that's it was greater than
[1:55:17] his natural amen amen amen
[1:55:22] brother bud when did you quit smoking
[1:55:26] just now brother branham
[1:55:29] just now
[1:55:30] never craved another cigarette in his
[1:55:33] life amen amen what is it
[1:55:36] soul thirst
[1:55:38] sulfur saints
[1:55:40] what is it the yielding
[1:55:43] of the soul amen to god my thirst lord
[1:55:47] is for thee
[1:55:48] oh lord amen his body was up there
[1:55:51] probably had to drink out of anything he
[1:55:52] could but what was come down here look
[1:55:55] at this all happening he's looking down
[1:55:58] he's thinking about the past he's
[1:55:59] thinking about his life remembering my
[1:56:01] brother and sister
[1:56:03] all
[1:56:04] of the things god has done for him
[1:56:06] and what his desire was
[1:56:09] his soul thirst was greater
[1:56:11] not for bethlehem
[1:56:13] but from jerusalem his soul was
[1:56:15] so he sacrificed the water and said i i
[1:56:18] wouldn't even drink it now imagine
[1:56:20] brother trevor you and i must have had a
[1:56:22] real hard time when we watched this man
[1:56:25] that we love so much
[1:56:27] take this that we fought for
[1:56:33] he had no right to do that
[1:56:36] that one guy just about stabbed me
[1:56:38] through and through
[1:56:39] and this was
[1:56:41] we're so weary
[1:56:42] why
[1:56:44] but god
[1:56:46] poured out revelation
[1:56:48] and it was there that david said what's
[1:56:50] more important right so i'm going to
[1:56:52] take this thing that i just longed for
[1:56:54] in my flesh
[1:56:56] and i'm going to sanctify it
[1:56:58] i'm going to sanctify it before the lord
[1:57:01] and then i'm going to pour it out
[1:57:04] and to the human thinking they think
[1:57:06] what was that
[1:57:08] that's a god he looked down on david
[1:57:11] and said there it is
[1:57:13] he has fully yielded himself
[1:57:17] he has fully submitted himself that he
[1:57:21] will go beyond the need and desire of
[1:57:24] his flesh
[1:57:26] to give it
[1:57:27] to me
[1:57:29] oh i tell you today saints i want to be
[1:57:31] that man
[1:57:32] i want to be that believer that would
[1:57:34] take all the things of this life all the
[1:57:37] things of this world and would say lord
[1:57:40] it's more important that i pour my life
[1:57:42] out to you
[1:57:44] than it is to satisfy this flesh on the
[1:57:47] things of this earth
[1:57:49] i tell you my brother and sister that is
[1:57:51] when we have died
[1:57:53] to the flesh
[1:57:54] when we can pour our self out
[1:57:57] amen
[1:57:58] i wouldn't even drink it he poured it
[1:58:00] upon the ground see his soul was more
[1:58:02] thirsty for god was to satisfy the
[1:58:05] quench of a good his thirst of his body
[1:58:08] with a good cool water he poured it upon
[1:58:11] the ground
[1:58:12] now let's just finish this up
[1:58:14] see the house of god the soul cooling
[1:58:16] waters of jerusalem which is above
[1:58:19] jesus said in john 6 33 i am the bread
[1:58:22] of life i am the bread of life bethlehem
[1:58:24] house of god our church
[1:58:26] earthly church of god the church that's
[1:58:28] here on earth we love to go to church
[1:58:30] here on earth but greater is jerusalem
[1:58:34] that above which is above which is god
[1:58:37] jerusalem above which is god greater is
[1:58:40] that soul's thirst to be there with him
[1:58:42] yes
[1:58:43] than it would be just to satisfy
[1:58:45] yourself with joining a church somewhere
[1:58:47] see joining a church don't satisfy that
[1:58:49] thirst david proved it here the waters
[1:58:52] right from the house of god see he
[1:58:54] poured it out upon the ground to find
[1:58:56] favor to get good cool drink
[1:58:58] from god amen amen
[1:59:01] hallelujah sister emmy would you come
[1:59:03] even on that greater the thirst that's
[1:59:06] in you
[1:59:07] is that thirst of the soul thirst for
[1:59:09] god hallelujah oh to yield ourselves
[1:59:12] saints to the soul thirst
[1:59:15] the thirst of this flesh of this man of
[1:59:19] the world we live in to be able to just
[1:59:21] give ourselves yield ourselves entirely
[1:59:24] my brother and sister do you realize
[1:59:26] you know the whole story i remember
[1:59:28] reading a book many years ago
[1:59:30] amen
[1:59:33] and it was talking about the basic
[1:59:35] principles when a young man goes into
[1:59:36] the military
[1:59:39] and
[1:59:40] we wouldn't agree with their uncouth and
[1:59:43] very vile ways of doing things but their
[1:59:45] goal
[1:59:47] their goal is understandable saints
[1:59:49] they take these young men from all these
[1:59:51] backgrounds
[1:59:52] they bring them in and they insult them
[1:59:54] and they they make them tired and weary
[1:59:57] and realizing they're unable to even
[2:00:00] exist without this mechanism called the
[2:00:02] army and they just break them down
[2:00:06] and bring them to the place
[2:00:08] if they say attack that hill
[2:00:10] their answer is not well the
[2:00:12] probabilities are this and this that
[2:00:13] i'll die and there'll be this many men
[2:00:15] and this will happen and that will
[2:00:16] happen they break them down and then
[2:00:18] build them back in an image that they go
[2:00:21] yes sir
[2:00:23] and they go take the hill
[2:00:26] do you see what god's doing yes sir oh
[2:00:28] saint he's not going to insult you he's
[2:00:30] not going to break you down he's not
[2:00:31] going to tear you up but he will bring
[2:00:33] you to the place
[2:00:35] that you have submitted your life
[2:00:38] 100
[2:00:39] to him
[2:00:40] and when he says you know i don't think
[2:00:42] you ought to do that you're going to say
[2:00:44] yes lord and when he says i want you to
[2:00:47] rise up and do battle on behalf of a
[2:00:49] brother or a sister i want you to stand
[2:00:51] in the camp for them and you'll be
[2:00:52] saying yes lord
[2:00:54] because that my brother and sister is
[2:00:56] the army of god
[2:00:58] men and women fully submitted to the
[2:01:00] word
[2:01:01] bringing to pass the word for our day
[2:01:04] oh hallelujah we will not go to heaven
[2:01:07] with our own mind
[2:01:08] [Music]
[2:01:10] only way we'll make it to heaven
[2:01:12] is the mind of christ
[2:01:14] i say my brother my sister i encourage
[2:01:16] you today as your brother is your friend
[2:01:19] just
[2:01:21] quit holding back that's right just let
[2:01:23] go
[2:01:24] you know one thing i'd say about the
[2:01:26] lord
[2:01:27] in military history there's many
[2:01:29] instances where they've set young men
[2:01:31] knowing that they would all die
[2:01:33] they sent him anyhow
[2:01:38] but you can't be that man for them
[2:01:41] because god's already that's it come on
[2:01:44] saints already imparted eternal life to
[2:01:48] you
[2:01:49] so god can't send you out on the
[2:01:51] battlefield just
[2:01:53] as a diversion
[2:01:54] [Music]
[2:01:56] because he's already given his life for
[2:01:58] you
[2:01:59] and placed it in you
[2:02:01] and that life oh get this
[2:02:03] that life will reproduce itself
[2:02:07] oh hallelujah
[2:02:10] thank you lord hallelujah
[2:02:12] hallelujah
[2:02:14] oh my god
[2:02:20] i didn't give this to the brothers here
[2:02:22] this last little quote the unveiling of
[2:02:24] god
[2:02:25] that word must grow
[2:02:27] in order to grow it's got to be in the
[2:02:29] right kind of ground see and god makes a
[2:02:32] promise and it hits that heart that's it
[2:02:35] it can't fail
[2:02:36] hallelujah i'm glad the word of god has
[2:02:38] hit our heart today my brother and
[2:02:40] sister amen
