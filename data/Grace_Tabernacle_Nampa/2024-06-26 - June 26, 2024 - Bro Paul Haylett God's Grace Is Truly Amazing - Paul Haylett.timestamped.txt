[38:19] Revelation amen that it is the same God

[38:31] looking and hoping but we're here
[38:33] because we are knowing amen we've come
[38:37] to a knowing and to an experience of who
[38:40] I am when the word's talking about
[38:42] behold I send you Elijah the prophet

[38:51] amen and I I really appreciate brother
[38:54] Alex's song service you don't know
[38:56] obviously the thoughts that have went uh
[38:59] through my head concerning this and it's
[39:02] going to be a very simple thought
[39:04] tonight I I hope you don't mind uh
[39:06] something just very simple just
[39:09] something uh that you know just kind of
[39:12] uh you know just bouncing around in the
[39:15] head and then you think I I just need to
[39:17] kind of just Express this uh maybe as
[39:20] much for my own good is for yours but uh
[39:23] I want to speak to you tonight uh uh
[39:26] amen let me back up here uh I just want
[39:30] to remind you communion will be this
[39:32] coming Sunday 5:00 and uh we're so happy
[39:35] to have brother IL and sister Natasha
[39:37] and their children beautiful children
[39:39] you have uh have them visiting us amen

[39:51] grace is absolutely amazing amen and uh
[39:56] you see the picture thank you musicians
[39:59] God bless you thank you brother Alex
[40:01] let's turn our Bibles to Genesis the 4th
[40:05] chapter verses
[40:07] 1-10 and um
[40:11] I I'll put it to you this way uh I had a
[40:15] little thought that was there in my in
[40:18] my thoughts and I if you look at my desk
[40:20] you'll see that I have a lot of thoughts
[40:22] that haven't made it any farther than
[40:24] being scribbled on a page and if that's
[40:27] seems awkward they tell you that people
[40:30] whose deaths are messy are
[40:33] brilliant so if that would help offset
[40:36] that but often times you have these
[40:40] these thoughts that are on a page or in
[40:43] a notebook or in your phone or however
[40:46] you would keep those and sometimes God
[40:48] just stores them up and at the right
[40:50] moment something happens from those and
[40:53] some of these right moments sermon
[40:55] Brother David preached recently sermon
[40:58] brother Dany preached at Camp some
[41:00] things that brother Chris has said and
[41:02] these thoughts of my own all jumbl
[41:05] together put together and um I hope that
[41:09] it makes sense tonight amen Genesis the
[41:12] 4th chapter veres
[41:15] 1-10 and Adam knew Eve his wife and she
[41:19] conceived and bear Cain and said I have
[41:22] gotten a man from the Lord and she again
[41:26] be his brother Abel and Abel was a
[41:28] keeper of sheep but Cain was a tiller of
[41:32] the
[41:32] ground and in the process of
[41:36] time this a little bit you know of what
[41:38] brother Chris preached a Wednesday or
[41:40] two ago time in the process of
[41:46] time it came to pass that Cain brought
[41:49] the fruit of the ground and offering
[41:51] unto the
[41:53] Lord let me just interject this right
[41:55] now just real quick I I'll lose the
[41:58] thought in the deal you realize that
[42:01] both of these
[42:04] men Drew their
[42:07] substance from the
[42:10] earth the Sheep ate of the
[42:13] grass growing in the earth Cain was
[42:17] bringing forth the fruit that come forth
[42:20] from the earth so I I'll elaborate a
[42:24] little more on that but we want to
[42:26] realize that that God had them very much
[42:29] anchored back to his creation they were
[42:32] they were not in another realm as we
[42:35] live in this day and age but they were
[42:37] right there connected to creation and
[42:41] Abel uh well back up in the process of
[42:44] time it came to pass that Cain brought
[42:45] of the fruit of the ground an offering
[42:47] unto the Lord and Abel he also brought
[42:51] of the firstlings of his flock and of
[42:53] the fat thereof and the Lord had respect
[42:56] unto Abel and to his offering but unto
[42:59] Cain and to his offering he had not
[43:02] respect and Cain was very WTH and his
[43:05] countenance fell and the Lord said unto
[43:07] Cain why art thou wroth and why is thou
[43:11] countenance Fallen if thou doest well
[43:15] shalt thou not be accepted and if thou
[43:17] doest not well sin lith at the door and
[43:21] unto thee shall be his desire and thou
[43:24] shalt rule over him and Cain talked with
[43:26] Abel his brother and it came to pass
[43:29] when they were in the field that Cain
[43:31] rose up against Abel his brother and
[43:33] slew him and the Lord said unto Cain
[43:36] where is Abel thy brother and he said I
[43:39] know not am I My Brother's
[43:42] Keeper and we see right here Cain was
[43:46] bold enough to lie to the
[43:51] Lord pretty strong isn't it stand in the
[43:54] presence of God tell a lie
[43:58] CU he knew exactly where his brother
[44:02] was and he said what hast thou done the
[44:05] voice of thy brother's blood crith unto
[44:07] me from the ground Heavenly Father we
[44:10] just ask you tonight just to bless this
[44:12] time together Lord just to be in
[44:14] fellowship with you father is is such a
[44:17] necessity for us but it's also such a
[44:20] blessing father for us to come together
[44:22] as Saints of like Precious Faith to to
[44:25] sing together to worship together
[44:27] together Lord to come in thy presence
[44:29] together Lord truly as close as Heaven
[44:32] on Earth can get as Sons and Daughters
[44:34] of God your bride worshiping in your
[44:37] presence we thank you for the
[44:39] opportunity ask you to guide us tonight
[44:41] in the name of Jesus Christ amen you may
[44:44] be seated amen now as we look through
[44:48] these scriptures we realize that uh the
[44:51] whole story of Adam and Eve and we see
[44:54] that here at this point in time they've
[44:57] already had the experience in the garden
[44:59] they've already had all kinds of things
[45:02] take place around them Supernatural
[45:05] things not not just random things that
[45:07] have no no real meaning but the
[45:10] supernatural had already taken place in
[45:13] their presence and so as it is this
[45:16] stumbles a lot of people on the Earth
[45:18] today uh because uh they say well uh Eve
[45:22] said that she had a child from the Lord
[45:25] but we understand as brother brandham
[45:27] brought it out very clearly for us and
[45:29] by God's grace we catch that that all
[45:32] life comes from God Amen so it doesn't
[45:35] matter there's no other creation there's
[45:37] no other uh uh uh seed out there but
[45:41] what the seed that God had put together
[45:43] now the fact that it got perverted uh we
[45:46] still recognize was part of the plan of
[45:48] God because if it was not God would have
[45:51] spoke and put a stop to it but we see
[45:53] here that this life that come and we
[45:56] look at Cain and
[45:57] as they are there these two uh children
[46:00] and as it was the course of life when
[46:02] they were little babies crawling around
[46:04] uh it might not have been so evident but
[46:07] it was this two Natures from the very
[46:10] beginning two expressions of humanity
[46:13] and uh as they grew up my brother and
[46:15] sister uh it's irregardless of the
[46:18] occupation some people have been poked
[46:21] pretty hard by people that says well
[46:22] Paul you're a tiller of the soil we see
[46:24] on which side of this equation
[46:27] that you are on but you see it's
[46:30] irregardless of the occupation it really
[46:33] had nothing to do with being a tiller of
[46:35] the soil or the Sheep amen so it's there
[46:39] regardless of that our offering we might
[46:41] be Engineers doctors this that and the
[46:43] other uh whatever we have to offer to
[46:46] God is has to be presented to be
[46:50] acceptable in other words my brother and
[46:52] sister if we were fabulously rich but we
[46:55] cared about our position position with
[46:57] God God would recognize and accept our
[47:00] offering just the same as he would
[47:02] anyone else and if we are the poorest of
[47:05] the poor God will still accept our
[47:07] offering this had nothing to do with
[47:10] occupation amen and if anything I'd say
[47:14] sometimes our occupation might be more
[47:16] hindrance than blessing but we'll look
[47:18] at this and realize that uh as we are
[47:21] anointed in this day in this time uh the
[47:25] culmination you might say to realize
[47:28] just how important it is to be
[47:30] acceptable it's no longer we'll take
[47:32] care of this later in life we'll take
[47:34] care of this down the road we'll take
[47:37] care of this under great ministry my
[47:39] brother and sister God's dealing
[47:40] oneon-one and I say Lord come and deal
[47:43] amen deal with us father that we would
[47:45] just know how important it is for us to
[47:49] be pleasing amen and so I I I just want
[47:53] to focus just to hear more on this
[47:55] before we move on Amen and being a
[47:57] keeper of sheep was not Abel's
[48:02] righteousness amen now the fact that God
[48:05] placed him in that position I believe is
[48:07] a very symbolic uh to me I I don't want
[48:11] to be wrong on this but I believe it's
[48:13] very symbolic because he had very much a
[48:15] connection with the offering that he was
[48:17] giving maybe more so in that nature but
[48:21] my brother and sister being a tiller of
[48:23] the soil was not Cain's curse
[48:29] amen I'm emphatic about that because if
[48:31] it didn't work for Cain and it had to do
[48:33] with that I'm in trouble but that's not
[48:36] where it was amen it wasn't a keeper of
[48:39] sheep was the righteousness and a tiller
[48:41] of the soil was the curse my brother and
[48:44] sister amen now you look and we can see
[48:47] this very clearly in the word before
[48:49] there was ever a formal theological
[48:52] schooling before somebody said let's sit
[48:55] down and teach people about the word of
[48:57] God let's teach them how to preach let's
[49:00] teach them you know as brother brandham
[49:01] said to you know say
[49:04] Amen you know as they sometimes still do
[49:08] but you look at that none of that uh was
[49:11] uh uh there at that time in a formal
[49:13] sense but yet the private interpretation
[49:16] of the word was already taking place so
[49:20] is there sitting there under this
[49:22] anointing Cain is hearing everything
[49:25] that was said from his childhood up and
[49:28] his mind his Spirit you might say the
[49:31] anointing upon Him processed that in a
[49:33] certain fashion but here is Abel hearing
[49:37] the exact same words and the Bible we'll
[49:40] say just for uh if you'll excuse me the
[49:43] Bible spoke to him differently the word
[49:47] that he heard had an entirely different
[49:51] interpretation to him it was not his
[49:54] formal schooling it was not you know
[49:56] that was a little more attentive in
[49:58] Sunday school or or bi Vacation Bible
[50:01] School it was something much deeper than
[50:04] that and when the word spoke when it
[50:06] came forth amen he heard an entirely
[50:10] different word and I tell you that's
[50:13] what's happening in the day that we live
[50:14] in the bride of Christ there's men that
[50:16] can preach this Bible so eloquent so
[50:19] powerful but my brother and sister when
[50:21] you preach the word and there's no one
[50:24] to hear it from God's voice
[50:27] it's
[50:28] powerless it produces something that is
[50:31] polished and fine but it doesn't produce
[50:35] life amen oh as a prophet of God said
[50:38] somebody spit and sputter and do
[50:40] whatever else but bring the spirit of
[50:42] God the Holy Spirit down in the midst of
[50:44] the people Let It Be we don't need
[50:47] polish my brother and sister we need
[50:49] Revelation and the revealing as it is of
[50:52] the word to you and I let us hear it
[50:54] different amen
[50:58] Hallelujah so this private
[50:59] interpretation is taking place and you
[51:02] can look at this because I I put this
[51:05] this way in my notes by Revelation or by
[51:08] man's idea because you see my brother
[51:10] and sister God uses man so sometimes it
[51:14] has been a man's words or a man
[51:17] explanation that actually triggered
[51:20] something in you but it wasn't the man
[51:22] himself so we can have the two-sided
[51:25] thing of this people say I got a
[51:27] revelation from the Lord that's almost
[51:29] like saying I got a child from the Lord
[51:32] if it's not really the Lord my brother
[51:34] and sister it's not really
[51:36] Revelation amen so if it's there you can
[51:40] have it by Revelation or have it by
[51:41] man's idea but you see what was
[51:45] happening with Cain is there was an
[51:47] understanding that he was taking he was
[51:50] receiving it was actually outside of the
[51:52] word it was actually what you would say
[51:54] extra biblical they had a whole
[51:57] formulation and in that what was taking
[52:00] place with Cain he's right there a
[52:02] tiller of the soil I don't believe that
[52:05] that Abel was Far Over the Hill
[52:07] somewhere I believe that he saw his
[52:10] brother probably every day and they was
[52:12] probably a rub shoulders interacted
[52:15] maybe even sat down an eight together
[52:17] and there was two men with two
[52:23] Revelations side by side
[52:28] every
[52:29] day and we'll see that it produced two
[52:32] entirely different
[52:34] results in the same midst the prophet of
[52:37] God said it'd come right down it'd be
[52:38] right in the church the preaching of the
[52:40] word and I'll just put it in this way if
[52:42] you don't mind the preaching opening of
[52:45] the scripture the reading of quotes all
[52:48] of these things come together will
[52:50] produce two entirely different
[52:53] results because one will be a man's
[52:55] revelation and the other one's
[52:58] Gods one will be God speaking and the
[53:02] other man speaking and in that realm we
[53:05] see what was happening with Cain and
[53:07] Abel it it's almost pardon me for
[53:10] putting it this way but it almost makes
[53:12] you feel sad for
[53:15] Cain because he went to
[53:17] church and he really
[53:19] thought that polishing everything up and
[53:23] making it its finest was what would
[53:25] please God
[53:27] but where did that idea come from that's
[53:29] right the one who wanted to exalt
[53:32] himself even AB above the Mount of the
[53:37] most
[53:38] high he thought if I can get in a
[53:41] position of leadership then I could turn
[53:44] this church around if I could get in a
[53:47] position of leadership I could really
[53:49] reveal to these people what the holy
[53:51] spirit is doing if I was in this but God
[53:55] said that's not really what I'm looking
[53:57] for I'm not looking for a man that can
[53:59] do all of these things I'm looking for a
[54:01] man that will introduce the people to
[54:03] Jesus Christ and get the Holy Ghost
[54:05] living in them not show them an image of
[54:08] the Holy Ghost but get the Holy Ghost
[54:10] into them and then let that word bring
[54:13] them into Heavenly places amen if they
[54:17] don't get the word in them as a prophet
[54:20] of God explained to us like astronauts
[54:23] they're not pressurized they blow up and
[54:26] look around us I I'm going to speak a
[54:29] little bit direct we around the message
[54:32] have had plenty of
[54:34] explosions and the reason is is because
[54:37] I'm I'm sorry to put this this direct
[54:40] but they thought they could make a big
[54:42] beautiful church and God would be
[54:44] pleased with that and so amen they they
[54:48] had an understanding that was outside of
[54:50] the word that was taking place and this
[54:53] is where Cain got confused because he
[54:55] was just as sincere in fact the prophet
[54:57] of God said he would be more sincere
[54:59] than you are oh that might smart a
[55:02] little bit but we can see that sincerity
[55:05] in the world today more sincere my
[55:08] brother and sister that we would be but
[55:11] that sincerity without God's pleasure is
[55:15] worthless amen there's no value in that
[55:18] amen and so as private interpretation is
[55:21] taking place Amen on the other side we
[55:24] have Abel by revelation amen something
[55:27] about it I we're just assuming a little
[55:29] bit but bear with me something about Mom
[55:32] and Dad talking about when they were in
[55:34] the garden and maybe they didn't really
[55:36] talk about it much but they knew that at
[55:38] that time that that Bloody sheep skin
[55:40] slapping around their legs as they
[55:42] walked out something anchored down in
[55:45] his soul and said there's something
[55:47] about the blood there's something about
[55:49] the blood that God cares about that he
[55:52] didn't choose a giant fig Leaf he didn't
[55:55] choose a banana he didn't choose any
[55:57] other kind of covering not a religious
[56:00] covering not an intellectual covering
[56:02] but he chose a bloody covering amen and
[56:05] in that realm right there something
[56:07] comes down in Abel's heart and he says
[56:10] you know what if God if God used a lamb
[56:14] in the very beginning and I'm offering
[56:18] myself in my recognition of my Frailty
[56:21] and the things of my shortcoming then
[56:24] I'm going to offer a lamb and amen and
[56:27] let the blood be the covering Hallelujah
[56:30] you realize that it wasn't the skin of
[56:32] the
[56:33] Lamb it was the blood that was on the
[56:37] skin
[56:40] Hallelujah and
[56:41] Satan certainly in the day that we live
[56:44] in we can see this very
[56:46] clearly but Satan anointed man to be
[56:49] very certain very sure of his
[56:52] idea and so as as Cain is there he is as
[56:57] sure as sure can be if we could be taken
[57:00] back in time and sit down as it were uh
[57:03] uh maybe the fly on the wall
[57:05] proverbially that that we'd be there and
[57:06] listen to this you would say Cain is
[57:09] sincere we see his sincerity it wasn't a
[57:13] flippant thing I'm just going to throw
[57:15] some flowers and some fruit on the altar
[57:17] he was sincere that this beautiful
[57:20] bouquet and all of the fruit of the soil
[57:23] would please God after all it was God's
[57:25] cre creation it come from it's God's
[57:28] Earth God's
[57:30] seed really how far off could Cain
[57:37] be if Cain had been
[57:40] right what would have been nailed to the
[57:45] cross a basket of
[57:48] vegetables see it's all out of
[57:52] kelter but in the moment come on you
[57:55] you've had moment moments we've all had
[57:58] moments oh what I'm doing everybody just
[58:01] I don't care what they think they need
[58:03] to just be happy with this oh okay some
[58:06] of you do grin pretty
[58:08] loud I didn't make a mistake there your
[58:10] grin was really loud you see we all come
[58:15] to time every man is right in his own
[58:19] eyes and here is Cain just as right as
[58:22] right can be this will please God
[58:27] so Satan anoints a man to be sure of his
[58:30] ideas but God anoints men or moves men
[58:34] to be sure of their
[58:36] ideas because when a man is Anointed by
[58:39] the Holy
[58:40] Ghost he can stand assured that he has
[58:44] the right
[58:46] thing can we say amen amen it's when
[58:50] God's moving in our life I'm not talking
[58:52] about us having an idea I'm talking
[58:54] about God's in the control tower and we
[58:56] can then walk out with confidence what
[58:59] I'm doing is what God wants me to do his
[59:02] leadership is perfect his leadership is
[59:04] powerful his leadership cannot fail me
[59:08] and if I am in him and he is in me I
[59:11] can't be
[59:12] lost amen the devil can't snatch me away
[59:17] amen now many men are
[59:21] sure whether they're right or wrong some
[59:23] are very sure
[59:26] and they're sure their confidence has
[59:29] killed many a
[59:31] person brother Bram says in Christ
[59:34] revealed in his own word amen very short
[59:37] quote but I I just thought it fit
[59:39] perfectly notice now we come back we got
[59:41] to have something another that we have
[59:44] to hold on
[59:46] to is't this interesting that our
[59:48] marriage vows that we
[59:50] take is to have it to hold right because
[59:55] God knew that that would be important to
[59:57] us we have to hold on to that and we
[1:00:01] need
[1:00:02] that something has to be a TI poost in
[1:00:06] other words it's an ultimate and
[1:00:09] everyone must have an ultimate or an
[1:00:12] absolute I preached on it one time years
[1:00:14] ago on an absolute a place that has the
[1:00:19] last
[1:00:22] word now I'm surmising a little bit
[1:00:24] please forgive me but I believe if Cain
[1:00:28] could have got down on the very altar he
[1:00:30] placed all the flowers and the fruit and
[1:00:33] prayed through yes he to come up with a
[1:00:37] different point of view but you see
[1:00:40] there's a point and this will get deep
[1:00:43] and I'm going to just skirt the edge of
[1:00:45] it for sake of time there's a point that
[1:00:47] people get down and they pray and they
[1:00:51] get up believing they have an answer now
[1:00:54] we have examples in the message I didn't
[1:00:56] include it tonight for time but remember
[1:00:58] brother Brown's praying with that young
[1:01:00] lady and she gets down oh I've prayed
[1:01:03] through and brother Brown says no you
[1:01:04] haven't you're going to go out and be
[1:01:05] exactly like you was right she was in
[1:01:07] the institution you're going to be
[1:01:09] exactly like you was and then she gets
[1:01:12] down and prays some more and brother
[1:01:14] Bram said still not far enough and you
[1:01:16] see when she finally got into the what I
[1:01:19] would say the the complete
[1:01:21] position that God was calling her to
[1:01:25] when she raised her her head that time
[1:01:27] and said brother Brown I believe I've
[1:01:28] got it brother Brown doesn't tell her
[1:01:30] keep praying because he knew she had it
[1:01:34] now if you follow me if Cain had come to
[1:01:37] that kind of a position Cain would have
[1:01:39] got up from the altar started collecting
[1:01:41] the flowers and the fruit and he'd have
[1:01:43] went and found him a lamb amen he
[1:01:45] wouldn't have just went home he'd have
[1:01:47] found a lamb because he'd had the
[1:01:49] Revelation that the lamb is the only
[1:01:51] Redemption that he had but you see he
[1:01:54] had an intellectual understanding and if
[1:01:57] he got up from that altar under that
[1:02:00] condition he'd have went and got more
[1:02:01] flowers and fruit said my offering is
[1:02:04] not big enough I didn't give
[1:02:07] enough but you see only one little lamb
[1:02:11] is all it took amen so we have to have
[1:02:16] as Believers as real Christians amen we
[1:02:20] have to have an ultimate or an absolute
[1:02:23] amen and in that realm right there my
[1:02:25] brother and sister you know it can't be
[1:02:27] the pastor and it can't be the church as
[1:02:30] a body my brother and sister it has to
[1:02:32] be our Lord Jesus Christ and he's
[1:02:35] already spoke to you and I amen he's
[1:02:38] already put his thoughts his Direction
[1:02:41] in written form and as we sit here
[1:02:44] tonight you know often times people say
[1:02:46] I just don't know what to do I've got
[1:02:48] questions about this or questions about
[1:02:51] that then read till you find the answer
[1:02:54] amen and I'll tell you how faithful God
[1:02:56] is this has happened in my own life I
[1:02:58] know it happened to the prophet of God
[1:02:59] there at the cave but I tell you I've
[1:03:02] had questions before literally sat down
[1:03:04] very troubled and sit down pick up my
[1:03:07] Bible put it in my lap and my Bible fall
[1:03:10] open and I look down and read and
[1:03:12] there's my answer it doesn't get any
[1:03:14] clearer than that I don't need someone
[1:03:16] to explain it to me I don't need some
[1:03:19] guidance for somebody to to you need to
[1:03:22] do this and need to do that God come on
[1:03:24] the scene open his book spoke to us
[1:03:27] through the written word amen and I tell
[1:03:30] you that happens a lot more than people
[1:03:32] really sometimes grasp that God deals
[1:03:35] with us amen so look at this an
[1:03:38] absolute
[1:03:40] now an
[1:03:42] atheist a real atheist not the ones who
[1:03:46] just want to dodge talking about
[1:03:47] religion a real atheist has an
[1:03:53] absolute in fact many of those real
[1:03:57] atheists are stronger committed than
[1:03:59] many Christians you couldn't budge them
[1:04:02] with a bulldozzer
[1:04:04] amen now look at the agnostic agnostics
[1:04:08] are interesting as as one brother told
[1:04:10] me one time he said you know agnostics
[1:04:13] are just full of
[1:04:14] excuses if you can get them emptied out
[1:04:17] and put something else in there they'd
[1:04:19] probably a Believer but because they
[1:04:22] they just don't know what to do they've
[1:04:24] heard so much negative seen so much
[1:04:25] Negative they they just uh uh you know
[1:04:28] nothing's
[1:04:30] known absolutely nothing's
[1:04:32] known and we can't prove it after all
[1:04:36] we've never seen Jesus I want to ask you
[1:04:38] tonight have you seen
[1:04:41] Jesus he didn't come in a physical form
[1:04:44] to us but he has revealed himself to his
[1:04:49] bride she knows who she's marrying she
[1:04:53] knows who she's engaged to she know
[1:04:55] knows who has the answer to her life and
[1:04:58] she knows who she wants to take a name
[1:05:01] yes
[1:05:05] amen the Satan worshiper if you don't
[1:05:09] mind I'll share just a little brief
[1:05:10] Story one time many years ago I I had a
[1:05:14] painting contracting business and and um
[1:05:17] you know often times you know they they
[1:05:19] give you all this the new the the person
[1:05:22] buying the house wants these walls these
[1:05:24] colors this that and the other and uh
[1:05:28] most of the time you never meet them but
[1:05:31] one day the contractor called me up and
[1:05:33] said Paul um this lady had um some
[1:05:38] particularly large furniture that they
[1:05:40] moved upstairs and scraped the walls
[1:05:42] up and I I knew I was coming he said I I
[1:05:47] need you to go touch that up take care
[1:05:49] of that okay I think I'm going to a
[1:05:53] house that you know it's just going to
[1:05:54] me there
[1:05:56] but I realized there's somebody
[1:05:58] here now I don't want to be cross but
[1:06:02] the person who opened the door didn't
[1:06:04] look the least like a Christian to me
[1:06:07] but in the course of painting touching
[1:06:08] up her house which was way more
[1:06:10] extensive um than it should have been um
[1:06:14] she starts to share her life she had
[1:06:16] been raised in some kind of a cult she
[1:06:18] had literally watched a child been
[1:06:20] killed for some kind of satanic offering
[1:06:24] and was terrified as the child that she
[1:06:26] would be next and she gives her whole
[1:06:29] story of her life as she's laying this
[1:06:32] all out then comes what I'm going to
[1:06:34] call the punchline and then she tells me
[1:06:37] I'm a born again Christian now in my
[1:06:40] experience with this lady not judging
[1:06:41] her but just going from this experience
[1:06:44] there was nothing I had experienced at
[1:06:46] this point prepared me for the idea that
[1:06:49] she was a
[1:06:51] Christian does that make sense to
[1:06:54] you and in that I started to to kind of
[1:07:01] well first off I felt like running out
[1:07:03] of the house
[1:07:04] screaming jumping in my pickup and
[1:07:06] driving away you can keep the tools uh
[1:07:10] but then something else happened and I I
[1:07:12] started to ask her
[1:07:15] questions I started to ask her what was
[1:07:18] what was your experience
[1:07:21] like now you were a admitted Satan
[1:07:28] worshipper how is that
[1:07:31] different from worshiping
[1:07:35] god well
[1:07:37] actually not
[1:07:40] much now at the time I thought something
[1:07:43] missing but the more I pondered this I
[1:07:47] realized remember an angel of Light
[1:07:50] that's right so close to deceive the
[1:07:52] very elect if it's
[1:07:54] possible then this woman had an
[1:07:56] experience but in the Christian world no
[1:08:00] one had ever taken her all the
[1:08:04] way so she went from a Satan worshipper
[1:08:07] to worshiping God but never quite this
[1:08:10] sounds rough but never quite made it to
[1:08:13] the
[1:08:13] throne never quite made it on the sea of
[1:08:16] Crystal before before God to receive
[1:08:19] that very enthusiastic did tons of
[1:08:23] things for her church but my brother and
[1:08:26] sister there is the
[1:08:28] image that we see the word talking
[1:08:31] about that this lady had not let go of
[1:08:35] all of the ritual of satanic worship and
[1:08:40] she admitted it she said a lot of things
[1:08:43] I I just realize I've got to change I
[1:08:45] tried witnessing to her but she wasn't
[1:08:47] interested she's like I've talked to my
[1:08:50] pastor over and over again and and uh so
[1:08:53] I don't need to hear from you and I was
[1:08:55] well good it wasn't my job but
[1:08:57] understand the satanic worshipper thinks
[1:09:01] they're
[1:09:02] worshiping the
[1:09:03] correct the
[1:09:05] enlightened
[1:09:09] powerful we get down to the rubber meets
[1:09:12] the road you can blame it on the prophet
[1:09:13] he spoke it not me the make believer
[1:09:16] sits right here in church goes for 20 30
[1:09:18] 40 50 years never really grasp the word
[1:09:22] because if he had grasped the word he
[1:09:24] would have moved into a whole different
[1:09:25] category what have changed their life
[1:09:27] entirely but they sat there and said yep
[1:09:29] that's what the prophet said yep that's
[1:09:31] what the prophet said yep that's what
[1:09:32] the prophet said I want to know do you
[1:09:34] know what God said about it amen because
[1:09:37] when God speaks he doesn't speak just to
[1:09:39] our ears he doesn't just speak to our
[1:09:42] emotion he speaks to our whole being
[1:09:46] from our head to our toes and fingertip
[1:09:49] to fingertip God doesn't do
[1:09:52] superficial and so as it is there what
[1:09:55] had happened my brother and sister and
[1:09:57] the whole time Cain and Abel were there
[1:09:59] Cain got Anointed with a superficial
[1:10:02] amen Abel had something and pardon me
[1:10:05] for using it like this but it made his
[1:10:07] toes T tingle amen he just had something
[1:10:10] he knew this is the word this is the
[1:10:13] life this is what I've got to do and we
[1:10:16] find I'll get ahead of myself here but
[1:10:19] we'll find that the
[1:10:21] interaction the interaction my brother
[1:10:23] and sister the same verbiage
[1:10:26] can agree on so many things so Abel
[1:10:29] sitting right there maybe in the
[1:10:31] presence uh of his parents and he's
[1:10:33] talking to his brother Cain and Cain's
[1:10:36] going yeah yeah that's right that's
[1:10:40] right but something down here is hearing
[1:10:44] something entirely
[1:10:47] different Abel wouldn't know
[1:10:52] that they would have parted ways that
[1:10:54] day or before that day and said I'll see
[1:10:57] you at church on
[1:10:58] Sunday he comes with a bloody
[1:11:01] lamb and his brother comes with bushels
[1:11:05] and bushels of vegetables and flowers
[1:11:08] and
[1:11:11] fruits okay he has a different see how
[1:11:14] scary this is when people say they just
[1:11:16] have a little different view of the
[1:11:19] message just a little bit different good
[1:11:22] brother faithful they're they're great
[1:11:25] but one shows up with a lamb and one
[1:11:28] shows up with a basket full of
[1:11:31] vegetables and we see what the story is
[1:11:34] one pleased God and one didn't oh Lord
[1:11:37] help us to have that understanding that
[1:11:40] Supernatural understanding Lord I don't
[1:11:42] want to just hear a good preacher I want
[1:11:44] to know what you think Lord I want what
[1:11:46] you said to register in me that I know
[1:11:50] exactly what you're thinking
[1:11:52] Lord I don't want to hear it second or
[1:11:54] third hand hand or I don't want to hear
[1:11:56] it
[1:11:58] intellectualized I want to hear it
[1:12:00] straight from the Throne of God it come
[1:12:02] as a two-edged sword and if it cuts me
[1:12:05] to the mar of my bone I want to say
[1:12:08] thank you Lord and amen to the
[1:12:15] word what happened to the real
[1:12:17] believer abble was there he didn't say
[1:12:21] hey look I was reading this
[1:12:25] or I fought
[1:12:27] this but there was something inside of
[1:12:30] him that was
[1:12:32] saying how this was it and how this and
[1:12:36] that was there and there's just
[1:12:38] something inside of me keeps saying take
[1:12:41] the first of your
[1:12:45] flock imagine a man who would love his
[1:12:47] sheep so much he knew which one of those
[1:12:50] was
[1:12:51] perfect think about it well this one
[1:12:55] got a bad foot bad leg can't hear can't
[1:12:58] see scrawny he's the prime candidate no
[1:13:02] sir he went out and took the very best
[1:13:06] that he
[1:13:07] had and he slew it now I think this was
[1:13:11] a moment of truth that must have maybe
[1:13:13] shocked both of them and when they come
[1:13:16] to that Altar and one's there and I'm
[1:13:18] telling you my brother and sister
[1:13:20] imagine what it would be your Sunday
[1:13:22] Best and you went out in your backyard
[1:13:25] and you killed the
[1:13:27] lamb Abel showed up looked like a
[1:13:31] mess Cain showed up
[1:13:35] perfect in fact I can almost see Cain if
[1:13:38] you don't mind me putting it this way
[1:13:40] going in the last moment and putting
[1:13:43] this flower just like this and arranging
[1:13:45] these grapes right here and get yeah
[1:13:48] there it
[1:13:49] is and here's
[1:13:52] Abel yeah
[1:13:55] what do I do
[1:13:56] with these bloody
[1:14:00] hands somebody would have said Abel you
[1:14:02] got blood on your face but what can I do
[1:14:05] about
[1:14:06] it had Revelation that it wasn't a time
[1:14:09] to go home and take a shower
[1:14:11] figuratively if you understand what I'm
[1:14:13] saying I got to get this blood off of me
[1:14:15] I say no Lord don't let us ever come
[1:14:18] under anointing to get the blood off of
[1:14:20] us Satan comes by all kinds of things
[1:14:23] occupations and relationship ships and
[1:14:25] this that and other for us to take the
[1:14:27] blood off but my brother and sister I
[1:14:30] say Lord pour the blood on us father let
[1:14:32] the blood keep coming to cover me
[1:14:35] because I am a man as the Apostle Paul
[1:14:37] speak to us when I would do good evil is
[1:14:40] present with me we can interpret that
[1:14:42] many different ways but Paul felt enough
[1:14:45] to speak those words and tell you I'm
[1:14:47] trying to do my best but Evil's right
[1:14:50] here
[1:14:51] amen I'm sorry about getting so excited
[1:14:55] amen but look all of them feel that
[1:14:59] they're
[1:15:00] correct oh
[1:15:02] my yes
[1:15:05] yeah possessing the Gate of the
[1:15:08] enemy Paul said none of these things
[1:15:11] bother me for he was tied to an absolute
[1:15:15] Christ and every true achievement is
[1:15:19] tied to an absolute I've shared to the
[1:15:21] church about that young man quite a few
[1:15:23] years ago was getting ready to run in
[1:15:25] the Olympics and ripped I think it was
[1:15:27] his hamstring or something Achilles
[1:15:30] tendon something like that so bad that
[1:15:32] he was just done they said you're
[1:15:33] finished and and he was like I I am
[1:15:36] Olympian I'm going to win I'm going to
[1:15:38] do this and he come to that place in his
[1:15:41] life where he had trained all he could
[1:15:43] train and realized that that the coach
[1:15:46] that he had uh was not going to be able
[1:15:49] to take him as far as he wanted to go
[1:15:52] and so he goes applies to be trained by
[1:15:55] another Olympic level coach and from the
[1:15:57] very first moment that coach just starts
[1:15:59] telling him you you you don't have what
[1:16:02] it takes you're holding back I watch you
[1:16:04] run you're not giving your all you're
[1:16:07] you're holding back oh I'm as fast as
[1:16:09] everybody you're not as fast as a
[1:16:13] winner and he he just did it and the guy
[1:16:15] would be so angry he wanted to even
[1:16:17] strike his coach and his coach was just
[1:16:20] telling him
[1:16:22] quit doesn't sound like a very good quot
[1:16:24] coach does it quit I'm not quitting you
[1:16:28] already have no I
[1:16:31] haven't and then one day he was actually
[1:16:34] almost
[1:16:36] angry and he broke
[1:16:39] through and from that moment on the
[1:16:41] coach quit deriding him and told him
[1:16:45] this is the man I wanted to meet right
[1:16:49] amen I'm telling you my brother and
[1:16:51] sister let me put it just uh a little
[1:16:53] bit straightforward
[1:16:55] the Lord isn't interested in our excuses
[1:16:58] he's not interested in our own madeup
[1:17:01] limitations he wants us to run the race
[1:17:04] until we break through and when we break
[1:17:07] through we'll run the race like never
[1:17:09] before and we'll rise into Heavenly
[1:17:12] places and he'll be able to say that's
[1:17:14] the son that's the daughter that I
[1:17:17] called before the foundation of the
[1:17:18] world they're not giving me a reason why
[1:17:21] they can't they're standing here today
[1:17:23] saying I'm going to respond and I will
[1:17:27] prove that I am a Son of God hallelujah
[1:17:33] amen and every true achievement is tied
[1:17:38] to an
[1:17:39] absolute you don't need brothers or
[1:17:41] sisters that you not in a boastful way
[1:17:44] not in a carnal way you you just realize
[1:17:47] they're real prayer warriors they're
[1:17:48] just real solid people they're they're
[1:17:51] they're going to amen they're going to
[1:17:53] help the those around them they're going
[1:17:55] to press to the mark
[1:17:59] amen true achievement
[1:18:04] right not the best voice not the best
[1:18:07] looking not the best attendance not the
[1:18:10] best of
[1:18:12] anything but they have made the true
[1:18:16] achievement amen and it's God not them
[1:18:19] that shows it it's the Lord am you see
[1:18:23] the fact that they have an absolute and
[1:18:27] there's nothing on Earth we see in the
[1:18:29] critics of this message my brother and
[1:18:31] sister we see them still moving still
[1:18:34] doing their work but I tell you they are
[1:18:37] too late with the bride of Christ their
[1:18:41] words of negativity and their words that
[1:18:44] there's a better life out there fall on
[1:18:46] deaf ears because the bride of Christ
[1:18:49] knows where her achievement come from
[1:18:52] she knows who she is she knows that the
[1:18:55] word's been open to her and it's a
[1:18:57] living bloody lamb and she is not going
[1:19:00] to walk away she wants his name she
[1:19:03] wants his name more than she wants
[1:19:05] wealth or fame she wants him amen not a
[1:19:09] church somewhere not a certain this or a
[1:19:11] certain that she wants him and she's
[1:19:14] going to achieve that
[1:19:17] hallelujah amen tied to an absolute my
[1:19:20] absolute is the word and everybody else
[1:19:23] that's that's really born of the spirit
[1:19:25] their absolute is God's word I'm tied to
[1:19:28] it I laid my hands upon it amen maybe
[1:19:31] you'll just reach over tonight and just
[1:19:33] put your hand on your Bible I've laid my
[1:19:36] hands on the absolute amen it's here
[1:19:40] it's the truth I'm tied to it I laid my
[1:19:43] hands upon it and it took my place and
[1:19:46] I've identified myself with him he knew
[1:19:49] that uh he we knew that he promised to
[1:19:51] identify himself with us isn't that
[1:19:53] encouraging
[1:19:55] amen it's not just us saying we're
[1:19:56] Christians we want to be Christlike but
[1:19:58] it's Christ himself coming down saying
[1:20:00] I'm I'm willing to come and identify
[1:20:03] myself I'm willing to stand with you I'm
[1:20:06] willing to be seen and heard and let it
[1:20:10] show let it
[1:20:12] show
[1:20:14] Hallelujah we knew that he promised to
[1:20:17] identify himself with
[1:20:18] us now just read this real careful let's
[1:20:21] just slow down Paul calm down Paul
[1:20:25] calm
[1:20:27] down and it what's it we live in a day
[1:20:31] where they use all kinds of
[1:20:34] whatevers seen a little video clip some
[1:20:37] young girl doing the he they there the
[1:20:42] whatever and I thought my heart actually
[1:20:45] ACH might sound like I'm kind of making
[1:20:47] fun but my heart actually ate cuz here's
[1:20:50] a young woman you can just tell that she
[1:20:54] knows this is is not correct
[1:20:56] speech see there's
[1:21:00] confirmation she
[1:21:02] knows you know the eye
[1:21:05] darting and then goes into the the the
[1:21:08] they there whatever thing it's like what
[1:21:11] what's happened there's no
[1:21:14] absolute no

[1:21:20] that God created me to be God made me a
[1:21:23] man I will be a man if if he made me a
[1:21:25] woman I'll be a woman but most of all he
[1:21:27] made us Sons and Daughters of God and
[1:21:29] I'm going to be a son or a daughter amen
[1:21:32] none of this well we they they're the

[1:21:47] unction to a personal
[1:21:50] action and it holy spirit

[1:21:57] identified myself with him amen we knew
[1:22:01] that he promised to identify himself
[1:22:04] with
[1:22:04] us and that brings genuine Faith
[1:22:10] sometimes I wished I could just block
[1:22:11] this out here let me you guys read that
[1:22:13] portion I'll block this portion
[1:22:16] out how many times do we I wished I had
[1:22:19] more faith I I this faith and this about
[1:22:23] faith and that about faith how about we
[1:22:25] just get in a position that we look at
[1:22:27] the word and say my Lord Jesus when he
[1:22:30] called me shed his blood for me amen and
[1:22:32] I committed my life to him it's not
[1:22:35] going to be me that makes a Rapture it's
[1:22:37] going to be him in me it's not my
[1:22:40] strength it's his strength it's not my
[1:22:42] Revelation it's his Revelation and
[1:22:45] there's nothing I can do it's all him
[1:22:48] and I don't even have faith enough for a
[1:22:50] Rapture but his faith in me is going to
[1:22:54] take me to a Rapture and when I come to
[1:22:58] that place I won't be able to go brother
[1:23:00] David we get on the other side I won't
[1:23:01] be able to say boy Brother David that
[1:23:04] last burst of faith I got no sir we're

[1:23:09] bunch of bewildered pilgrims and said
[1:23:12] I'm here I made it Lord how did this
[1:23:15] happen it was you Lord amen because it's
[1:23:18] not our faith is his faith and his faith
[1:23:21] will
[1:23:23] produce oh oh thank
[1:23:26] you that brings genuine faith not your
[1:23:29] own faith his faith something that you
[1:23:32] don't control how many times are we like
[1:23:35] I want to go to these special meetings
[1:23:37] they they said that there they're going
[1:23:38] to be some Faith meetings you know like
[1:23:43] you're going to go there with a bucket

[1:24:02] don't misunderstand me I'm not speaking
[1:24:04] down on that but we promote our
[1:24:07] faith we promote our faith and we ignore
[1:24:10] what he's trying to do to bring Faith up
[1:24:13] in us what is it it's a word it's a word
[1:24:17] it's Christ himself he's Faith he's the
[1:24:20] word that's coming up to give us an
[1:24:22] unction I I I won't go into it uh sister
[1:24:26] Jerry won't know what I'm talking about
[1:24:27] but she was there many years ago in
[1:24:29] Cloverdale amen I knew what it was to
[1:24:33] feel something Supernatural take place
[1:24:37] and walked out of that place and within
[1:24:39] four days God healed me my brother and
[1:24:41] sister I couldn't have told you that day
[1:24:44] oh God's healed me all I know is there
[1:24:46] was something flowed up through me I
[1:24:50] felt it and it was there and I'm sad to
[1:24:54] say by the time we got in a car and
[1:24:55] traveled home all the other circumstance
[1:24:58] of Life had slid that kind of to the
[1:25:02] backside until a few days
[1:25:04] later I was like I'm
[1:25:08] Healed I'm
[1:25:13] Healed you know what it was
[1:25:15] the
[1:25:17] Catalyst I say this in a natural sense
[1:25:20] brother bcll saying you know what
[1:25:22] communion is a good time to receive your
[1:25:28] healing and I said
[1:25:31] Lord I want to be
[1:25:35] healed that's all it took was that
[1:25:38] Paul's
[1:25:39] faith not even
[1:25:41] close I only had faith enough to say
[1:25:45] Lord I desire
[1:25:47] that that's where my faith stopped I
[1:25:50] didn't say I'm going to be healed in the
[1:25:52] name of Jesus Christ but his
[1:25:55] faith took that and brought it to a
[1:25:58] resting place and then carried it to
[1:26:01] fruition Allelujah he does it you don't
[1:26:05] control it he does it now notice then
[1:26:07] and then only when is the promise made
[1:26:10] to
[1:26:11] you not when we're saying I've got faith
[1:26:13] I've got faith I've got faith why don't
[1:26:15] we get right down and say Lord you said
[1:26:18] I believe it is here the evidence is
[1:26:21] proven the holy spirit's here and I am a
[1:26:24] son of of God and I just yield I just
[1:26:26] give myself Lord you know the old sign
[1:26:31] whose fool are
[1:26:33] you okay let's hurry along
[1:26:38] here see
[1:26:41] so in in sixth and seventh verses of
[1:26:45] Genesis 4 there the Lord speaks to Cain
[1:26:48] and ask him why are you wroth why is
[1:26:50] thou countenance Fallen if thou doest
[1:26:53] well thou sh uh and shalt thou not be
[1:26:56] accepted and if thou doest not well sin
[1:26:59] lith at the door I'm telling you that
[1:27:02] was as powerful of a of a evangelist
[1:27:06] type sermon as man can ever receive
[1:27:10] right
[1:27:11] there but you know where the thought of
[1:27:15] just how amazing grace is this is a
[1:27:20] son this is a son
[1:27:25] of Satan
[1:27:28] himself let's cut it right to the
[1:27:31] chase right
[1:27:33] there and the Lord says just do the
[1:27:36] right
[1:27:38] thing Son Of Satan he didn't use those
[1:27:40] words right but Son Of Satan Cain if you
[1:27:44] just do the right thing you will have
[1:27:48] eternal
[1:27:49] life is that not Amazing Grace that God
[1:27:53] would reach out to the very one that
[1:27:55] hated him tried to upset the whole
[1:27:58] Kingdom have a new plan and offers him
[1:28:00] here's the word here's the life just do
[1:28:03] the right thing and Cain knew what the
[1:28:05] right thing
[1:28:06] was but he sat there and there was
[1:28:09] already seeds
[1:28:11] planted there was already circumstance
[1:28:14] that was
[1:28:15] there imagine Cain sitting there
[1:28:18] going
[1:28:21] wait I can receive the same thing that
[1:28:24] that Abel
[1:28:25] did or this
[1:28:27] chance I can rise
[1:28:31] up and
[1:28:33] up and
[1:28:35] up and
[1:28:38] up to the sides of the
[1:28:42] north and actually be above
[1:28:48] this but it was already in him the seed
[1:28:52] had already been sown
[1:28:55] it had already sprouted was already
[1:28:58] coming into
[1:29:00] fruition it wasn't automatically that he
[1:29:03] was just cast
[1:29:05] down he had his
[1:29:10] choice God
[1:29:12] offered that to
[1:29:19] me Amazing
[1:29:22] Grace and here we are
[1:29:25] born in
[1:29:27] sin shaped in iniquity and every one of
[1:29:30] us is told the
[1:29:32] lie and God
[1:29:34] says just do the right
[1:29:37] thing I'm here to offer
[1:29:40] life just say yes and here's a seed in
[1:29:44] you and I that is crying out Lord I want
[1:29:48] to serve you Lord I want to do the right
[1:29:51] thing I want to have your Holy Spirit I
[1:29:53] want to have a a communion with you and
[1:29:56] yet maybe even in our own
[1:29:58] family they would say no that's
[1:30:03] fine talk about breaking your
[1:30:06] heart but God
[1:30:09] said I've got Grace this is why the word
[1:30:12] says that he would save everyone some
[1:30:15] people stumble over that well these
[1:30:17] people here they wouldn't do my brother
[1:30:18] and sister if if uh uh Cain had said
[1:30:22] you're right can can I go back lord and
[1:30:25] find a lamb can I come and kneel before
[1:30:28] you and and prostrate myself and offer
[1:30:31] this sacrifice he'd have eternal life
[1:30:34] but there was already something we can
[1:30:36] say predetermined we all understand
[1:30:38] predestination but my brother and sister
[1:30:41] there's the little caveat that shows
[1:30:43] that God's right there to offer life to
[1:30:46] those that he knows already have made
[1:30:49] their mind up
[1:30:50] no and he still says sincerely
[1:30:57] sincerely here's life that's right just
[1:31:01] receive it just receive it I want to I
[1:31:04] want to hurry up and close here
[1:31:07] amen so he's offering him eternal life
[1:31:10] amen and so to to
[1:31:13] Cain God's word the Lord's word was not
[1:31:17] the absolute that's right cuz when he
[1:31:20] says if you'll do the right thing if
[1:31:23] he'd took that is an absolute he' to
[1:31:25] submitted to it that's right and now I'm
[1:31:28] going to speak some harsh words we got
[1:31:29] way too many people around the message
[1:31:31] that say the messages they're absolute
[1:31:33] but they don't submit to it that's right
[1:31:35] their life is not a reflection of it
[1:31:38] they are reflection of a seed already
[1:31:43] planted now not all of that's bad don't
[1:31:46] misunderstand me sometimes these seeds
[1:31:48] that are planted oh you don't worship
[1:31:51] enough jump up on the pews and run
[1:31:53] scream shout oh you're too
[1:31:56] wild you're this you're
[1:31:59] that I remember a preacher one time in
[1:32:01] the message none of you have a prayer
[1:32:05] life how did he know
[1:32:07] that preaching to some of the finest
[1:32:10] solid Christians I've ever met in my
[1:32:12] life their whole life revolved around
[1:32:14] the word of God and this man had the
[1:32:16] boldness to declare you don't even have
[1:32:18] a prayer
[1:32:19] life what I'd like to know what was his
[1:32:22] prayer life yeah
[1:32:25] because you see he didn't encourage
[1:32:27] anybody he took faithful Christians and
[1:32:31] they walked out of the service at night
[1:32:33] and doubted they were even saved I don't
[1:32:36] think that's what God wants us to do he
[1:32:38] wants us to come face to face with our
[1:32:40] failure he wants us to come face to face
[1:32:43] with our shortcoming he wants us to come
[1:32:44] face to face and when the word is there
[1:32:47] my brother and sister and it speaks to
[1:32:49] us that we have an unction inside of us
[1:32:52] the holy spirit that says yes Lord yes
[1:32:55] Lord I I I want to repent from that I
[1:32:58] want to come closer to you I want your
[1:33:00] life Lord More Than This Very life and
[1:33:03] when we do that God what's he doing he's
[1:33:05] coaxing us he's bringing us in and you
[1:33:08] say well brother Paul okay that would be
[1:33:10] but my brother and sister it's got to
[1:33:12] start with the word being the
[1:33:15] absolute it wasn't with Cain Cain was
[1:33:18] under another influence he had another
[1:33:20] absolute you know what it was it was
[1:33:22] Beauty not bloody
[1:33:24] right it was beautiful amen there's no
[1:33:29] culture in a bloody lamb absolutely no
[1:33:32] culture at all now look I I I don't
[1:33:35] recommend you guys do this sometimes I I
[1:33:38] dive into things trying to follow
[1:33:40] through a thought but my brother and
[1:33:42] sister we're living in a world today the
[1:33:45] driving force in a modern church it's
[1:33:48] not the Holy Ghost it's
[1:33:50] culture and where culture is at there's
[1:33:53] no blood
[1:33:56] kide of the altar not a drop of
[1:34:02] blood not a
[1:34:04] drop he would attracted everyone that
[1:34:06] wanted a beautiful
[1:34:08] altar Abel side
[1:34:11] bloody bloody amen it's not going to
[1:34:15] attract culture it's going to attract
[1:34:18] those that have an
[1:34:20] absolute amen so you look at that what
[1:34:24] it is I want you to just kind of bump
[1:34:26] along through some of this you
[1:34:31] see how the
[1:34:33] word right before our eyes as it would
[1:34:36] be in 1 John
[1:34:38] 37-13 verse2 actually is what we're
[1:34:40] searching for not as Cain who was of
[1:34:43] that Wicked one so clearly
[1:34:47] identified that Spirit of culture that
[1:34:49] that beautiful offering the sincerity
[1:34:54] still had a wicked Spirit behind
[1:34:57] it create in me Lord create in me
[1:35:01] tonight Lord a clean heart right I don't
[1:35:04] want to speak all the right words and
[1:35:06] have a heart that is the heart that is
[1:35:10] considered Wicked
[1:35:12] amen now let me
[1:35:18] just Hebrews 11 and4 we know that
[1:35:20] scripture amen uh we just bump along
[1:35:24] here just real quick you know
[1:35:27] I I really I just find that very
[1:35:30] powerful verse seven you know if thou
[1:35:33] doest well shalt thou not be
[1:35:36] accepted how powerful that is it's right
[1:35:39] there before him he could just make the
[1:35:41] decision I want to change I want to have
[1:35:44] a different understanding I want to have
[1:35:46] a revelation of you amen I look at this
[1:35:51] amen I think I've already spoken all of
[1:35:54] this here just in a out of order not out
[1:35:57] of order different
[1:35:59] placing I hope it wasn't out
[1:36:02] order Amen Let our cry be I need more of
[1:36:07] you
[1:36:07] Lord let our cry recognize the
[1:36:11] spirit because Cain come with such an
[1:36:15] arrogant Spirit he was certain his
[1:36:19] offering would receive
[1:36:21] accolades he was sure that the Lord
[1:36:24] would go
[1:36:26] Man Cain all that you've done and you've
[1:36:29] made this so beautiful and here's his
[1:36:34] brother he's over
[1:36:36] here with just a bloody
[1:36:40] lamb I mean after all that's kind
[1:36:43] of
[1:36:46] disgusting that Bloody lamb I don't
[1:36:50] think he had a shay knife or whatever
[1:36:53] the model day were just a nice clean
[1:36:55] little
[1:36:58] cut imagine so
[1:37:01] committed and such a
[1:37:04] type I give this to you Lord this I
[1:37:08] offer to you my best not Second Chance
[1:37:12] not second class and as he's doing this
[1:37:15] the blood just as it was in the temple
[1:37:18] and the Tabernacle the blood flying up
[1:37:22] and covering
[1:37:25] Lord I want to bring you a bloody lamb
[1:37:27] today I want to bring you my most
[1:37:30] sincere
[1:37:32] offering I want the blood all over me
[1:37:36] Lord let it be splattered on me let it
[1:37:39] run from my hands be on my face my head
[1:37:43] my feet amen amen

[1:37:49] hallelujah see
[1:37:54] when we just
[1:37:55] cry isn't that what the word says just
[1:37:58] cry out his name when we just cry it
[1:38:02] don't have to be beautiful it has to be
[1:38:05] sincere amen let's just stand sister VI
[1:38:08] if you would come
[1:38:10] musicians Allelujah had some other
[1:38:12] things here but I think I pretty much
[1:38:13] covered it I trust this I don't know if
[1:38:15] it really would be even called preaching
[1:38:18] tonight but it something was on my heart
[1:38:20] I just needed to get it off how
[1:38:24] amazing is his
[1:38:26] grace much more amazing than sometimes I
[1:38:30] believe we recognize and act upon
[1:38:34] because we still make our
[1:38:37] mistakes we still start to
[1:38:40] drift away a little
[1:38:43] bit what does he
[1:38:45] do he doesn't say well I'll just sit
[1:38:47] here and watch them till they hit the
[1:38:49] ditch no sir he calls us back
[1:38:53] and when we are weak he is strong and
[1:38:56] when we're distracted he comes to get
[1:38:59] our
[1:39:00] attention every aspect that we can see
[1:39:03] in our life we'd say well I I sin
[1:39:08] today I sin

[1:39:11] today go back to the
[1:39:14] word repent from the action but go back
[1:39:17] to the word and he says you're
[1:39:19] sinless you can't tell me that's not
[1:39:21] Amazing Grace in the course of you just
