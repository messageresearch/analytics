assurance that we have access to you at any moment at any time we thank you that we're able to bring these needs to you this morning our sister toma lord we know that you're always on time and we ask you lord to give her traveling mercies and let her come back with a renewed joy and zeal in her heart to lord just be a real witness and lord jesus we pray also for our sister laura lord we've asked

family and her husband we call for this and have called for it and we do believe that what we've asked you we have now believe we do believe we receive it therefore in the name of jesus christ that thy perfect will be done in our behalf we call for this lord we are under expectation to receive from thee this morning we are under expectation for you to minister to us beyond what paul knows as a

prayers the lord our god in your presence that's where i belong for seeking your it's in your presence oh lord can someone say thank you lord say amen this morning oh lord it's in you father in the cleft of the wrath it's the only place i find security find peace and find comfort oh lord the only place that my heart can just rise up in the liberty and sing with true joy and pleasure is in your presence oh lord oh hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah thank you lord jesus thank you lord jesus hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah oh my you know sometimes i have to admit saints this morning early i did the little if you'd call it i don't know routine i normally do i sit down in the evening time and i write all the thoughts and all the things and i write them all down sometimes i don't even start to put it as it were in the ipad it's just there and i'm pondering at night i go to bed and i pray lord tonight make this real to me and i got up this morning and i started down this path and i found myself going off on this little crossroad i got out there a little ways and seemed like something said turn back and i come back to my thought and went a little further and i turned off on this little crossroad something spoke to me and said turn back so i just spoke to brother jason here i wish he'd remove the camera from my office because you see saints if i had ordered a song service this morning i'd have to say by god's grace i never thought of a single song here but if i could order it it would be this song service every song speaking to me and bringing me back to the crossroads that i in my thinking wanted to turn down i say thank you lord thank you lord hallelujah amen just before we go here i just want to remember the graham family on vacation i'm not sure i'm envious yes i'm envious anyway they're going to be gone for several weeks in arizona it's not all fun for brother adam he's going to paint uh his father mother-in-law's house and do some fix up work that needs done so remember them it's just not a total vacation just mostly anyway also service today when we dismiss you the service won't be over we're going to go downstairs and brother chris is going to have the grand privilege of baptizing his daughter this morning amen and so as as it is to be a minister and to be in that own place right there of your own child coming to you and desiring and being able to give that advice and leadership as as not just a father but as a minister of the gospel so uh when we are done today we'll just all go downstairs uh i don't want to explain it right now but that's probably how we'll do baptisms in the future uh versus putting the tank up here and and stuff so amen i want to speak to you this morning now having said what i said i gave this sermon 10 different titles this morning and then i'd get another inspiration from a crossroad and i rename it and then i come back and i said i'm going to take it back where i was in the original and i gave it another name but names don't really matter what we're looking for the title on the book right it's what's in the book and the word says that the life is in the book that's why we eat the book we don't just carry the book around and say i have a book right man i don't want to go down this avenue but i want to kind of make this point home too many people are walking around with a message book saying i'm in the message but we got to get the book from out here in here amen and when we get the book in here people are going to be saying um there's something different about you what is it i've ate the book amen i've ate the book and the book is good and you know now pardon me for using such a simple analogy all of you have some favorite little snack but my brother and sister if you're there well i'll just tell on sister jerry she makes queen elizabeth cake some of you if i don't offend anybody sister yulia said i like that cake amen and uh but let me tell you sister jerry when we were in monmouth for the sake of time i think and she made it a little different sister you lit you wait till you taste this new version and i ate a piece and i got up and i said i know i shouldn't eat this but this is just too good for just one helping too good and i had to go back get another piece now forgive me for my analogy but that is the gospel if we're not oh saints let me say it this way if we're not in the position that you have to go back for another bite then here's an altar and we need to pray through but when we get in that position we just can't stop eating the book it becomes so real so alive it tastes so good even though maybe there's something in our life that the book now becomes bitter because i realize lord i i have to now purge this from my life i ask you father come and wash this away from me deliver me from this certain affliction amen let's just go into the word today once again overall title i just couldn't break tradition um two sides of obedience and i want to speak to you on spiritual maturity and then because i couldn't give up on all these thoughts i have another title which i didn't give to the brothers to put on there but it's spiritual maturity in heavenly places amen we don't want to come as theologians i don't i don't want to be a theologian amen hallelujah as brother rich sings over there and they send greetings to the church brother rich sings this song i i never knew it till i heard it from them i don't want to be a goat nope i don't want to be a goat nope somebody help me finish that i can't remember the other words because a goat has no hope that's right amen and it just strikes me what a i think it's probably a children's song and i'm a child at heart and you know you just listen to and it's like yep lord i know who i am i know that i was called i've been redeemed it's a finished work but lord don't let me display any goat nature but then the devil comes and scratches on the screen door and we find ourselves but but but but oh that's a goat nature saints but we're going to have a butt here today that we're going to talk about so let's go to our bibles to ephesians the first chapter first verse and um just pray today um you know i hope you don't mind saints just lately some things in my life uh some things you know the lord dealing with uh in me you know some little complexes that he finally said it's time to stamp them out uh little circumstances around us where you say lord uh i i didn't ever intend to do someone any harm or anything but yet you know little things come and we have to deal with that and you know the lord's just gracious isn't he and um so as the word speak to us my brother and sister we just come to certain places and then we realize what it is that god wants us he wants something that you're going to preach now brother branham said often times okay so anybody who has ever felt i preached at you you can lift your hand and say yeah i think you preached at me no don't but did you know the prophet of god said that often times the minister is preaching on what is happening in his own life so if we took that in that light instead of saying i'm offended the pastor's preaching about me having a temper well what you don't know is maybe the pastor who hasn't had a hiccup in years had a little temper tantrum oh i hope you all don't get too shook up about that but you see then god takes that and causes that minister to go back in the word and he starts looking at his own life and starts examining whatever it might be i just use temper tantrum as an example and he starts looking at these things and he's oh my oh my and then we recognize everything happens as brother david shared with us god's in control and so as satan comes up like a roaring lion and says wow i sure swatted him into the dirt but god actually said you know what for him to preach this in sincerity to the people i think maybe he might need to experience that and then in stomach instead of coming judgmentally the minister can come and say i know what this is like and by god's grace we overcome it by god's grace we can press to the mark of the high calling amen ephesians 1 1-5 paul an apostle of jesus christ by the will of god declaring i'm only in this position by god's will to the saints which are at ephesus and to the faithful in christ jesus which means we don't have to go to ephesus to receive this amen grace be to you and peace from god our father and from the lord jesus christ covered all the bases right there in the godhead my brother and sister blessed to be the god and father of our lord jesus christ who hath blessed us with all spiritual blessings in heavenly places in christ according as he hath chosen us in him before the foundation of the world that we should be holy and without blame before him in love so we can't take all of this and leave love out right the apostle paul included love here now he also declared in the word that love is corrective so don't think that the pastor the minister or our lord jesus christ doesn't love you because he corrected you it's a very integral part of our christian walk having predestinated us into the adoption of children by jesus christ to himself so in case i don't catch this a little farther along i want you to focus for one second here who did he bring this adoption into himself we're not adopted into the message as it were we're not adopted to be baptist methodist pentecostal we're adopted into jesus christ himself so if the devil comes and tries to give you any other identity are you with me the devil comes and tries to give you any other identity you hold up your adoption papers and say my adoption papers say that my father is jesus christ amen almighty god elohim jehovah prince of peace mighty god sorry devil i'm already been adopted i've not been put up for adoption again because my adoption papers say that this work that my father has started it's a finished adoption there's no room for a last-minute denial and sending us back to the orphanage hallelujah ma doesn't that make you happy and here we are a group of faithful god-fearing believers and it still stirs something within our soul to say thank you lord that the final a seal of the adoption has been put in place oh my oh my oh my having predestinated us into the adoption of children by jesus christ to himself according to the good pleasure of his will heavenly father we ask you this morning lord let us just step into a realm father where it's just you and us lord no thoughts of man and no distraction and lord we would actually just rebuke any spirit of distraction that might to try to bring us father from being able to see the full conclusion of the word in our life and father ask you today speak to us lord the prophet of god encouraged us to pray for revelation and lord i lift my own heart and my own hand this morning lord reveal your word to me father don't let it be limited but what i see at this present moment but father i ask you to open the windows of heaven and speak to our hearts today in the name of jesus christ bless all those father who are not here with us today lord touch each heart give healing virtue father whatever is necessary in the lives of your children we ask we commit this to you now in the name of jesus christ amen you may be seated saints good to see you sister to bethel amen i don't pronounce that right i i'm i've been around jay too long and words names that i think i i've i've just known and i find myself you know kind of like just hacking them up [Laughter] and i say that in all humor amen now this morning saints i want you to just uh look at this for just a moment there are four references uh in the bible concerning heavenly places and they're all in the book of ephesians in chapters one through three and so i want to if the lord wills maybe go through all four of these verses over time here and uh touch upon this but we'll look at this now and the ephesians my brother and sister were scholarly bunch of people they were they were not a bunch of uneducated neanderthals but they had a real basis of education they had an understanding and it is in this place and time that paul comes and he starts to refer in these four scriptures of heavenly places and so i wanted as we take our thought today from ephesians one i just want to pull this out i started originally i had quite a bit side roads quite a bit of things connected to the other four and then something spoke to me and says hey you've got from now to the rapture to preach this so just bring it back keep it simple amen so as we take our thought from that look at the apostle paul is speaking very positive to the believer isn't that beautiful i'll tell you what saints i there's times that we as ministers uh have to speak some pretty strong things but be honest if i i can share from my heart i like preaching a positive gospel amen we are believers now does that mean that we don't have little things we deal with well we'll get on that in a little bit because the devil would like you to believe every time you ever even scuff the toe that you have somehow backslid but we stand here knowing that we have a very positive gospel and god has come and he didn't wave oh i hope this don't sound kind of sacrilegious but uh uh you know sometimes you know little things just stir you and you know our little teddy dog if you have anything that resembles food in your hand he sits down and he can sit straight up and he just looks at you and says you're obligated to share with me but you'll never find the lord jesus christ holding your adoption paper over you beg come on beg it's not how god works he declared it in his word he says it's done and therefore it is finished and i will bring it to pass aren't you glad amen our adoption paper is not locked up in a box somewhere it's been revealed to us amen it's made so alive that we have come and even so much that we are desiring right the scripture is talking about a new name my brother and sister we're not here to preach on that this morning but i'm telling you it's become so real to us that we're longing for to the revelation as it were of that new name which it's not as complicated as some people like to turn it you know that you're going to look in the rock and you're going to be there but the real true bride now you go into three kinds of believers the prophet of god lays out i won't go into that because you're you're well aware of that but he lays out the atmosphere and the attributes of those people that will sit in the house of god and the devil would like to tell you today that you're probably make believer or unbeliever because maybe you've had some struggle in your life in the last day month year years but that's not how it god looks at it and so it's there the devil would come and try to anoint the believer to believe maybe he's just make believing this because i have great trials and i've had struggles and i've had failures but we're going to touch on that in a minute but you look at this and realize what god is doing he's bringing you here and he's causing you to press through this great cloud now you realize there's two clouds of witnesses amen the scripture because it's speaking in a positive sense doesn't talk about the cloud of witness of those demons released out of the river euphrates that all testify that you're lost all testify of your failure testify of your inabilities those are not the witnesses we're paying attention to saints but they're here and we can't just shoo them away leave me leave me they will come back at their opportune time right so they're looking at your life and they're saying now is a moment to put fear in them now is a moment to put doubt in them now is a moment to get them to look and realize that they have just stumbled and so that host of witnesses is present with us right the prophet of god preached on the two spirits in the framework of the christian church and praise the lord it was just real simple multiple choice the holy ghost or satan's anointing hallelujah just reach out on your touch screen which is right up here just reach out on your touch screen and say you know what satan i i just in my mind i refuse to accept and then we'll go a little further and go down into the soul realm or the heart realm and say absolutely without a doubt i don't accept and then just stand on that never move from it and the lord will take care of the rest now take this now in verse 3 speaking so positive here who hath blessed us blessed be the god and father of our lord jesus christ who hath blessed us and and i cut a bunch of stuff out today saints because it just can go on and on and on but the prophet of god says now look at this and when he says who hath blessed us he yeah brother branham says now now look at this that is past tense that is not something to be in the future something that might happen but god has already blessed you saints can you lift a hand and say thank you lord i'm already blessed amen now the problem is is people say where is this blessing now it's different that god has already given the blessing to you as to when he actually manifests it in your life so we're thinking that if god's already blessed me then that should be so evident right here right now of what this is but my brother and sister it is and and we'll refer to this again but in the stature of a perfect man you know i think what i'm going to do is build me an elevator and get from the bottom to the top in one easy step but it doesn't work that way you have to labor you have to press into and you have to lay claim to amen and then by the profession of your faith you are able to attain to these things now it's not just simply we see it we understand it that we could come and say okay now i'm going to just go and i'm going to start manifesting all of this and i'm ready for the camp stone no it's god who determines when we're ready for the capstone amen so we cannot so you look at that and realize now that we are already blessed and so if the word says it amen now just let me sidetrack a little bit something that spurred me today and i see now why it was now look at this this morning i'm there studying and i come across some things that brother branham said in the message and it stirred another thought which pushed a button and stirred another thought if you guys can follow me and i just go and turn on the computer and i type in there should a christian woman have long hair now we know what we believe right and we know why we believe it right we don't believe it because somebody just decided to preach it to us we believe it because it's the word and so it was interesting my brother and sister if you could ever just put in a whole bunch of bottle rockets in a big barrel and lie them all that's as scattered as the thoughts are concerning that people would take answers like well god loves us we can do what we want good good deal that's the devil's doctrine you just do what you want but you see the heart was never converted so the want is the want of the flesh so they may as well said just do whatever your flesh allows you to do all the way to and i told sister jerry this morning i said you know they might have been message or their pro pentecostal but one person a lady she she put it in this little forum she put it very clear she said if god said it just do it i like that right isn't it nike it's got to just do it well wonder they might have got that anointing out of something besides just some man's mind see if god said it just do it so it's there that when we are blessed my brother and sister you might as well can i be presumptuous this morning you might as well start lifting a hand up and start confessing i'm blessed i'm blessed huh i'm either got problems in my life i've got financial problems relation ships i don't know why no stop stop the word says you're blessed so let's speak the word amen and just start declaring i'm blessed the wheels fell off the car i'm blessed you see it's a past tense position and as i said already it does not really matter when god chooses to manifest it he's already given it to you so in the bank of heaven there is every blessing that you need every spiritual blessing is placed there and i would declare there's also every natural blessing oh i was so fortunate that this come along when it did i'm so blessed that god answered this prayer when he did you know what it is god's up there saying now's the season now's the need now's the time and we just think oh god heard my prayer and answered it the scripture tells us the answer is already on the way so you can choose to believe god got in a hurry frantic like you are and you know sent an angel by express i don't know roped a star grabbed the sun beam of light and hurried down and delivered it just in the nick of time that'd almost be like a santa claus story but you see we're blessed with all spiritual blessings now there's quite a few different definitions of the word all i mean three letters have you know multitude of definitions but my brother and sister all doesn't mean partial all doesn't mean something missing all doesn't need the necessary need to add all is a complete yes and he says we've been blessed with all spiritual blessings now my brother and sister we can sit here and i don't know maybe i'm different than you but uh we can sit here and and you know we can pray oh lord i need you to bless me here and bless you there but really you know what it is saints is god's just waiting on us that's way farther in my notes but we'll include it twice just to get it home and my brother and sister uh we're not waiting on the lord he's waiting on us and so it's a time and a season for us to come into this now we can look in natural studying and you know i researched some time back a deal you know young men or young people that become wealthy uh you know parents die in accidents and they inherited millions while they were still in their teens and there's very very few of those stories turn out to be a success story because usually they become overwhelmed caught up and lifted up in that position look through the bible and see the multitude of those kings who come into kingship as a child and how many of them carried through and served god there's only a handful that are referenced through scripture but you'll also find it's even smaller handful that were found faithful a lot of it you know what it was wasn't that the heart didn't want to they were given bad advice they prayed and they thought god was going to answer it in the morning they desired and they thought it should become to them in that time but those that waited on the lord you see they had a heritage that carried through and the scripture talks about how they were faithful just as their fathers were and some were not faithful as their fathers were you see it's all in the position that we would take you see because we either have to take the past tense and put it into the present tense or we will one start looking back and we will question it and if we are looking into the future tense as the saying goes we will miss what god is doing now so my brother and sister we stand here this morning knowing that we have received all spiritual blessings but i'm praying that the lord delivers them as it were in my life when it is necessary or maybe when i am mature enough to handle this right because a authority or power without character is satanic and so there we see many a person that has been caught up in these spirits because they got lifted up in their own revelation of the word they got lifted up in their own position and so you know if we are sitting here this morning the recipients of all spiritual blessings i want to ask you saints just if the devil's been bothering you what part is missing what could we this morning as believers of the message say is missing now you see satan will come and tell you because of a certain situation in your life there is something missing well satan just scrambled the words my brother and sister and turned it around in such a way and presented it back to you yeah there's something missing it's usually called a complete surrender see satan wants us to view that the message as it were the gospel of jesus christ is insufficient for your life and maybe even bring it back directly into the message insufficient for you just listening to a little clip the other day i'll just throw this out to you it's been talking about why they don't believe brother branham would be god's prophet because they had several instances of people prayed for and they felt so much better they walked and they did all this stuff but in a few days one man's wife nine days later she's dead she's in the grave and the man's like but the prophet said she was healed do you see what the equation is saints they put it all back to him he said she was healed it was right here in her hand to accept it come on now i can say this remember i told you about the preacher preaching things that he's done so thank you lord for healing some of you when we were back in the old church you you remember these things and then i get out the next morning and my knee hurts so bad i can't even walk and i'm like oh my am i going to live with this my whole life my needs been fixed by a doctor there's nothing else he can do oh my i can't imagine another you know 30 years 40 years like this see how slippery the devil is he reached right in there healing is right here to be claimed deliverance is right here to be claimed revelation is right here to be claimed but we've got something else on the forefront of our mind something else that is the distraction and i'm distracted because i'm ahead of myself but look at this my brother and sister they come along and say couldn't be real declared my wife was healed and now nine days later she's in the grave i don't know what her position was but he obviously didn't believe you see we can't claim a promise my brother and sister while we disbelieve that very promise we not cannot claim these things of the gospel and then hedge our bet right remember brother brown talks about that that native in africa that come there and and he wants to know why are you carrying that what was that little little mud or something idol well just in case this god jesus can't defend me from the lion my daddy was carrying this when the lion came for him and he had this idol and he lit a fire and the lion left and they can't make the connection now i say this with a bit of humor because it's sad but his next time out in the bush and the lion come he better have some matches ready because his idol will not do one thing concerning that lion now my brother and sister we cannot say but i i prayed that god would heal me and then have a pocket full of matches are you with me and that's not going to work you either believe or you don't and i think in the age that we live in we have too many people that straddle the fence on this and they say well it's just natural for us as humans to be slightly skeptical my brother and sister i'm not natural human i am as i spoke to you earlier a son of god adopted i have the papers it shows who i am in fact it goes deeper than just the papers the dna of that blood flows through me now i i was gonna put this down this is not my original thought but it inspired me i was gonna put this in and i didn't but i'm gonna go ahead and say it i'm gonna tell you my brother and sister because i carry the dna you carry the dna of our lord jesus christ your blood will not mix with the devil there is no life in the devil for you and the blood carries the life it will not cross there is no serpent seed in us hallelujah now what would we say that we're without today my brother and sister we've encountered those that say well the the seventh seal ah i want to ask you i'm not going to argue with it the people who want to do that they can just go ahead and believe what they want but i just want to ask you a simple question did god put redemption on hold because the prophet said that the seventh seal the opening of the seventh seal was redemption to the bride so did god say well i opened up they caught a glimpse of it i'll put it on hold no sorry the mercy seat is on the heart of the believer and wherever the believers at the mercy seat is present and we'll tie that lord willing here in just a few minutes amen so we look at this i think what it is myself remember i preached an opinion here recently i'll share one with you i believe the problem that we're not see the thing that we're not seeing this or the problem that's present with us is that we're not in the right position my brother and sister remember what it was when they come and moses had tried to appease the people and it come down that joshua had learned his lesson right jehovah joshua and they said you know what we're just going to stay on this side of jordan it's a land of full of grass and and we're cattlemen joshua didn't say now well look uh we'll compromise build a bridge of jordan so you can come and go no he said you'll either cross over or you will die just like your father's now if we preach that way in message churches my brother and sister there'd be a whole lot less people in message churches because they want to build bridges the prophet of god said we're not wanting mixers we're wanting separators and if the word said depart out of that land get your feet and get the dust from your feet and go on then we don't want to say what lord i'd like to build a bridge now god was gracious to them and he allowed them after they fulfilled the word to come back and claim that land on that side of jordan but my brother and sister he didn't let them claim it in a spiritual sense it became an entirely natural gift of god to them no spiritual connection at all but they had to first fulfill the prophecy which was connected to the spiritual realm they had to fulfill that just like you and i hallelujah amen now i'll just throw this in for a little context for you to grab people say well i don't know about brother so and so he's got a lot of money he's worth a few million dollars of this that and the other and i just don't know about that you know my brother and sister i want you to catch this fulfill the portion of seek ye first the kingdom and all these other things were added to them reminds me when they had the fire in chile and it burned up all those believers homes i got a phone call from a brother in in canada and he said brother paul he said um look i want to help and i said well brother we're really close to our goal of what we need he says well i don't care about your goal the lord laid on my heart to help and then he told me how much money he wanted to send to chile and i was like wow that's as much money as we have already collected and the brother says now please keep this a secret. because nobody in my church knows that me and my sons have this kind of money i was like okay we fell into a lovely conversation and he says i i have proven the words that you cannot out give god i send money to every need that we hear about and i send and i don't send sparingly and then we come and and we bid on a project and and we win it and and there's like no one else bids and we just get it and we're so blessed that we we just do so well and so i say family we can give more and they give more and then he says i come and it comes again and we get blessed again and he said i can't out give god now the point i want to drive home to you what kind of life are they living that nobody in their church knows that they're worth millions simple humble godly priorities in order maybe god does know who to give the money to you see the thing that we have my brother and sister i think sometimes we're simply not in the position you say well i'd like the lord to do this and do that but we're not in the position to see or receive why no more than when my son when was he was 10 years old would i give him a pickup and just to these parents i'll throw this in right now anchor it in your reference make your children earn it you don't want your child squealing the tires and abusing the rig and jumping curbs and whatever else make him work hard for that you children that are coming up close to getting your driver's license i'm going to remind your parents over and over again you make them labor for that then they'll respect it now i want you to look at this what would we be if god just handed blessings out to us just random box fulls of blessings we wouldn't respect a single one of them but god knows how to bring us into a place so i i share that as a opinion that way you can just toss it if you want to but i'm wondering if it's just simply you know people say well i'm not seeing the blessings of god well you're probably not in the right position and you're not in the right maturity to receive that maybe as the prophet of god was speaking about that spring maybe god's still washing the clutter and the twigs and all the garbage out of you and you're not ready my brother and sister for that position now you see as i look at this and going back to the scripture i've looked through the word of god and i cannot find a single promise of these blessings to the believer that's in carnal places nowhere does he say you know what i'm going to do that in fact we can use a lot as an example imagine my brother and sister the difference if lot had said you know i think i want to stay up here on the plains of memory abram wouldn't have no choice but to go down to the well-watered lands of sodom but you see the blessing was given to abram abraham i imagine there had been a revival broke out down there on the plains of sodom and then it had been fire and brimstone and that all these all these carnal whatevers that were there in this city would it would have had to have departed they couldn't have stayed there with the word in their midst but you see you see the very nature that was in sodom was a nature that was calling out to lot and lot was attracted to sodom he could see the neon signs from up here i don't know have any of you ever topped out highway 95 or 95 93 i mean and have you ever topped out highway 93 north of las vegas when you top the rise it's just a glow you still have 90 miles to drive lot was up there with abraham and he could see the glow of sodom and he says i want to know the glow and abraham says i've got enough right here in my heart that's already got me lit up i don't need a las vegas i don't need a sodom but look how gracious god was there was enough there oh i'm so distracted excuse me but look there was enough there that when lot was in his position god sent a messenger to him and said come up to the mountain come up to the mountain there's a light on the mountain come up to the mountain and what was lot's answer i can't go i'm afraid we've got no reason to be afraid of the holy ghost saints come on if the devil's got you shook up and you're afraid of a complete surrender to our lord jesus christ then i ask you get down and pray through we have no reason to be afraid of giving our whole heart mind soul and body to the lord jesus christ that's the devil saying oh you might have to give up this and repent from this and do this and do that my brother and sister it's the devil is the author of fear and if you wonder who's the god of this evil age you go on any continent in any place and fear is running rampant right now amen people are afraid hallelujah my bible says these things have to come before i get out of here amen let it come then lord so look at that see we look for spiritual blessings my brother and sister not in carnal places in heavenly places now i don't think we have a real problem in our church i still feel compelled to preach it if you tell me you don't have enough time in your life to come to church i'm going to be obligated to tell you you're deceived we don't have enough time left in this world to not be in the house of god not that well you know i have this i have that well my job brother paul well why don't you pray for a promotion demotion or god put you in motion to go get another one come on it's too short of time saints besides that we're teaching our children priorities lord help us see now look what what's happened satan's misdirection i thought this was a kind of a lovely thought satan's misdirection reminds me one time a little story i read how these guys down south america had set up a little robbery ring this was not that far in the past people fly into the international airport in buenos aires and they walk out on the curb and they say taxi they get in the taxi they tell them i i want to go here the taxi leaves out gets on the interstate takes an exit the people say uh where are we going he says oh this is a better route now i hope my humor doesn't offend anyone they usually would find these people alive and well in their underwear walking on the highway back to the city because you see they were misdirected and taken out and the taxi driver delivered them as it were to the den of thieves now the government argentina don't really care about you as an american so much so hey if you're healthy they're not even going to investigate go look for your empty suitcase they're not going to try and figure out who this is but they will tell you um next time make sure you know who's taking you to the city hallelujah there's a city on mount zion hallelujah i've got a certain guide to deliver me to that city and it's not this ministry or that ministry it's the holy ghost hallelujah so what do we do we seek direction not of the council of men although god uses men but of the counsel of the holy ghost is what brings us into that full assurance of our position so satan tries to misdirect mentally anybody ever have a mental battle you know your own little daisy god loves me god loves me not god loves me god loves me not god loves me god loves me not nope get another daisy well it was important enough the prophet of god preached greatest battle ever fought right so we can laugh about that and we'd say well i it was important enough the prophet of god come and dealt with that now look what satan's stated position interact with me if you want to what what is satan's stated position he's a deceiver now in that we could take the context deceiver liar et cetera but the scripture also calls him a thief and what he's doing is he's trying to steal your inheritance now your name is already in god's word amen it's already laid out these promises are yours but satan's trying to steal your inheritance that you actually will then spiritually live like a pauper after all you have no money you have no future you have no blessing the word says you've already been given all the blessings satan comes and tries to steal all the blessing so that while you remain believing in jesus christ you live like a spiritual pauper because you don't really believe you can overcome that issue in your life now saints i would never ask you to no more than i would myself want to but if we were to start declaring those things that are the thorn in our flesh you know what i'm talking about every one of us would have something we'd say this is the thorn in my flesh and i would for the sake of conversation ask you is that not covered in the word and i believe the answer from you would be yes it's covered in the word then we have to ask ourselves why is this a thorn i already have deliverance healing and restoration i already have it why is this still a thorn because we either have allowed satan to keep us out of position or he's so clouded our mind that we think that can't be for me that's too glorious that's too beautiful that's too supernatural that's two that's two that's two now when satan stole that from you did that really mean he got it no sir i would be taking a little bit liberty with it but the prophet of god said you know if satan come in under the blood he'd be your brother so he's not really stealing that blessing from you he's just keeping you from getting to it because he really doesn't he handles the word but he handles it in a deceptive fashion so he never really wants to get a hold of the supernatural word even though satan operates in that impersonation of the supernatural he doesn't really want the true word my brother and sister because the true word brings repentance and let me drive this home the true word brings repentance and when people say oh i'm in the message i believe the message where's the repentance you say but i'm a believer i'm a believer well we'll touch on this in a quote in just a minute amen now look his stated position to keep you from your inheritance to keep you on the bottom rung of a spiritual ladder if he can keep you from climbing up that now look i know this is a little awkward for me to bring this out this way but they did research my brother and sister and they took and hung a banana up in the top of a cage a monkey cage they hung a banana up there and um then they took the rope that led up to the ma to the bananas and they made that when the monkey got up within a certain distance of the bananas they shocked him almost sounds cruel doesn't it but they were proving a point and well it's a good point spiritually also so after they had shocked this monkey enough he no longer climbed the rope to try to get the banana then they introduced another member in the church i mean another monkey and that monkey went that's a banana guys why don't you go get the banana and the other monkey is like if you know the story of my life if you knew what i've gone through you would understand why i don't try to get the blessings i mean the banana and the other monkey would start to climb the rope to get the banana and they no longer had to shock them because the first monkey would jump on that monkey and drag him down to the ground and no doubt gave him a speech about how you have no rights to take that banana then they introduced the third monkey and the fourth and the fifth the sixth seventh eighth ninth tenth and then to prove that the research was not flawed they cleared all the monkeys out hung a fresh banana put a new monkey in the cage and didn't do anything and that monkey went up there ripped that banana off there climbed over on a perch peeled that thing and ate it oh god let this old creed and traditions just die let those spirits that would come and tell us the supernatural is finished that you've went too far that you're too weak and it's not for you and it's not for you and mother you can't pray for your baby you have to have the pastor nonsense my brother and sister we need to get the old monkeys as it were out of the church and we need to introduce a fresh spirit in the church that we would realize that promise of god has already been given to me and i don't care what you think i'll fight you over it and then if you fight him over it they call you anti-christian unmessage-like and have no love well it's because i love the word more than i love you but the word will compel me to love you i might have to do it at a distance though and i might have to love you in my prayers because one says the monkeys i mean the banana is mine and the other says no no that's for the ministry only that's for them over there only are we doing okay amen so satan wants to keep you at the bottom of the spiritual ladder now don't lift your hands i don't embarrass no one but maybe a little mm-hmm to yourself any of you ever been kicked back to the bottom room amen i'll tell you what i'll do i'll lift my hand for every one of us because if we're fighting a true fight of faith we've been kicked back to the bottom rung and we thought i ain't even a christian i ain't even a christian because a real christian would never have done that well praise the lord let's just go right here in hebrews chapter six part two ah brother david told me a while back i can't say cherry pick no more but you know what it is when you pick them luscious little fruits right out in the middle of the tree you didn't pick all of them over here and all of them over there you just saw one that was hanging out there that looked bigger and juicier than the rest and you picked him and that's kind of what i'm doing the problem of god the prophet of god says right here in hebrews chapter six part two i don't act clean and pure and holy to make myself a christian oh we can try doing that have you ever tried doing that when i first started coming back to the lord and you know i i've done a lot of stupid things in my life i started coming back to the lord god gave me a godly wife she's like i'm going to take the children i'm going to serve lord paul kind of no matter what you do but i want to do it with you and so i started kind of cleaning up my my act and cleaning up my thoughts and cleaning up my deal and and you know cause before that i used to lie to my wife and tell her i had to work on sunday then i'd go work on sunday and help him feed and then i'd be done feeding we were feeding about 30 000 head of cows and i'd be done feeding about the time church started so it was just too late for me to go praise the lord like those people who set their alarm at 10 15. and they say i i would have came today but i just i would be late come on don't lie to yourself no lie to everybody else amen all you got to do is take the old alarm clock and turn him back to about 6 15 and no matter how slow you go at that point you'll make it i don't act clean and pure and holy make myself a christian but christ in me not next to me not in the car not in the house amen my wife being a good christian is kind of going to rub off on me and when we get there i'm going to say look you know this word says that we're one flesh and she lived godly and i just lived and so don't i get in for free no but christ in me lives that in me now we'll i'll expand on this not now because i'm going to be too long right now anyway but we'll expand this as we go into these other these other uh verses other chapters in future dates here my brother and sister you see because one of those if you just want to cheat and go read those said he makes us to live in heavenly places trevor cox you will live in heavenly places wouldn't work would it sorry because we have this old flesh but look at this now but christ in me lives that in me you know what that is when you get in the scripture and really go dig down into that you'll find that it's making you what's on the inside is making the outside conform to what's living on the inside amen and so it's there that it lives that in me and i love him and if i do anything wrong it condemns me oh but look at this now people be i'll tell you i could name their names right now write out loud but that wouldn't be fair and right not christian no people would say whoa stop right there see if you did this without it saying that brother branham said it and you said oh i do wrong it condemns me they jump all over you the holy spirit does not condemn a believer it convicts him okay good read it your way and if i do anything wrong it condemns me now look at just the basic definition of condemn is censor or express disapproval oh amen who's been censored this last week [Laughter] and who's going to say thank you lord for censoring me amen and to those people who have such an high and mighty thoughts my brother and sister you know look right here he said and if i do anything wrong it condemns me right there i'll say now brother branham's not talking about you you you he's talking about himself and he says right there i'll say god forgive me every day i got to ask forgiveness every day and you do too certainly you do so the prophet brought himself right down out of some people's supernatural stratosphere and put him right down and the prophet of god is telling us that every day i'm saying lord forgive me every day something touching his life that is lord forgive me and i tell you what that does it gives me a great bit of joy because i never pass a day of my life but what i find myself saying lord forgive me for that action for that speech for that thought that behavior lord forgive me and then after a while you come back and you're like my i'm just so repetitive about this well you have encouragement to be repetitive you've got encouragement to never let your day go by but what you stop and say lord forgive me for the weakness of my flesh and thoughts and actions and emotions and whatever it might be hallelujah amen because you see god is not wanting you to act like a christian he wants you to be a christian amen now obviously there's something that happens uh in our lives that we just start acting like christians but see let me just turn a corner here the devil would like to come along okay everybody stop now don't fall asleep if you're tired just close your eyes and think about the last thing you ask the lord to forgive you for and the devil will come along and say that's why you can't live in heavenly places that's the reason you'll never be an overcomer that's the reason you cannot be what the word said someone say amen i don't think i missed the mark very far amen you see what it is is satan like to give you idea you can't live in heavenly places but the word says the word says can somebody repeat that with me the word says hallelujah that i've already received spiritual blessings in heavenly places amen the limiting factor will be my ability to die i don't die i cannot receive those blessings because god's not going to bless us with a carnal spirit he blesses us with the holy spirit so satan holding you down now remember that song we sing sometimes satan had me bound but jesus set me free look i'm telling my brother and sister this message is a message of liberation this is not a message for us to sit in church and be living under condemnation of days gone by if you still have that you either need to tell the devil he's a liar or you need to get it under the blood for sure and both of those you can do right now you don't need a confession booth you don't need a month or six months or a year you can do that before you walk out of here and then we'll put the devil right back where he belongs and put him as the scripture says under our feet hallelujah no longer just going through life beaten down beaten down beaten down it's time my brother and sister for us to claim our liberty amen hallelujah the lord is our liberation the word brings liberty you know what heavenly places is not a feeling yeah it's not a feeling i like that feeling of liberation though i love that feeling when the holy spirit's moving you know i was just telling brother jay i'll just make my little rose public i was blessed by the song service on wednesday night i come to church oh my do i just go ahead and tell you all the things that i'm concerned about and i'm praying about well i probably shouldn't it embarrassed some of you but i just felt under a great burden i come to church wednesday night in the song service all of a sudden we're just not hardly a song into the song service i literally felt a weight lift off of me and i felt myself just i just wanted to worship the lord and then brother chris comes out it was brother chris wasn't it i can't remember it seems like a month ago brother chris comes out just starts preaching laying the word out there and i walked out of church just feeling mighty fine hallelujah amen hallelujah it wasn't it wasn't brother jay it wasn't brother chris it was god said you know what i don't want you to walk out of here i've got a message that brings liberty i don't want you finding some post and putting your ear on it and say i'm just going to be bound the rest of my life i'm just going to serve my mistakes oh you know that's what a lot of people are doing come on saints i'm telling you the truth this morning you're not serving god you're serving your mistakes and hoping god will forgive you of your mistakes wrong interpretation of the word you put it in sincerity under the blood and he said i will forgive you now the prophet of god when he told the story about the ink and the bleach he didn't say now some of you will have sins that the blood can't dissolve no no no no no no no no no no no no no bleach doesn't work on bic ink no i'm telling you the bleach works on all ink the blood works on all sin hallelujah you see heavenly places is not a feeling saints and it's not a declaration of doctrine what do you think church we self-publish our own creed why do they call them books that people they have in them churches brother david you know where they have all the rules and bylaws and all of their um it's just far from my mind but you guys know what i'm talking about should we kind of their creed yeah should we publish one of those do we do we need one of those around here or can we just from our heart accept this one and then we'll take the holy spirit on our life and we'll sign as it were that page in heaven it says lord i believe your word i believe your word you see the problem is when man got interjected in there satan said now if i can keep them down here at the level of the church come on saints if i can keep them down here at the level of the church they'll feel really good i'm going to church and i'm feeling mighty fine everybody's going to see this new suit of mine but if they really saw me from time to time they would know this suit and i are not saved because it's never going to be a relationship between you and the church it's not a relationship between you and a preacher a denomination it's going to be hello in the carnal interpretation not going to be a relationship between you and the message that's why i insist saints that when we talk about the message we recognize that is jesus christ now in some parts of the country you crucified for that and i don't mean anything out of that my brother and sister but let's just mark it for what it is that when we have our vocabulary and we're talking about the message and the message changed my life then you could say jesus christ changed my life we can put that as an interchangeable thing but if you literally mean it well i can go introduce you this afternoon right now drive you up to a man that tells you the baptist church changed his life and we'd be no different if we don't recognize this message is jesus christ so what is it it's a spiritual position in jesus christ that's heavenly places my brother and sister we cannot say we are filled with the holy ghost and live under a cloud of depression all the time that cloud might come and that cloud might go and circumstances of life come and they go but if you never found liberty my brother and sister i encourage you to go back and get to the altar and ask god to reveal the real truth of the message because jesus christ never bound the people don't go through he bound spirits but he never bound the people he set the people free and bound the spirit and that's what we want in this church can we say amen we don't want to bind people we don't have rules and we're going to dictate to you what to do here and to do there my brother and sister we want the spirit broken did you know if people actually recognized the spirits of this age a lot of these things they dabble around in they'd never touch it if god pulled the veil from their eyes and they realized this good friend who influences me is the devil and you say brother paul that's kind of harsh but look if they're keeping you from the word and influencing you against the word that's a demonic spirit but if you recognize the spirit i think a lot of these things people dabble in had a brother tell me here recently he said i was so discouraged brother paul he said one of my children was looking at some deal on the internet and said dad i think you probably ought to look at this this whole group of message kids belonging to this little forum debating the merits of pop rock and whatever they call all of that stuff come on young people have courage enough to stand up and say that's not of god that's not of god that'll take a soul to hell right there and it won't be my soul because i'll get away from that because i recognize as it is the old proverbial then there's somebody there with a forked tail pitchfork and horns we wouldn't touch it with a 50-foot pole after we've seen that god help us look i want to put it to you right here pray that god opens your eyes to the spirits of your situation pray that god opens your eyes so you can see what the anointings are around you amen i was reading a little deal a minister not him nothing to do with the message and he says it's strange the harder you try to help people the more they fight you we're here to help not to hurt but they can't tell the difference amen right oh my so you didn't condemn the person that's right amen now we sang a song and i can't remember the name of that song but i got all excited hope you all don't mind i hope you didn't leave your your food cooking on the cooktop there because it's probably going to burn praise the lord come on amen because this quote here is a whopper of a quote it's an 18-wheeler amen we might have to get brother sergey to go to his truck to haul this quote away but look at this and elijah had been up on mark mount carmel for a long time god been feeding him by the ravens and finally there come a time where god was preparing that man for a great outstanding miracle and he called all israel together and thought surely if they could see the supernatural hand of god move they would believe that god was god now look we just had some preaching dealing right on this subject put every stone in the right place no cut stones it's got to be built right and when you come you can call on bail all you want is he sleeping maybe he's gone he's over here he's busy you're on call waiting call israel supernatural hand of god move that they would believe that god was god for the nation was polluted with a backslidden king ahab and wicked adulteress jezebel and they brought the nation under idolatry and it was breaking the heart of this servant of god and do you know as i said the other night people we better check up on our experience for the holy ghost is only going to anoint in the last days those who sigh and cry for the abomination that's did in the city you see the problem we have around the message is we just kick dust at them you just keep kicking dust and i'm not saying this belligerently you just keep kicking dust and wait and see what kind of attitude you end up with you will not end up with a submitted holy ghost attitude because god's not going to give you all spiritual blessings in a carnal place sign cry for abominations in the city today we can shout and we can scream and we can speak with tongues and have signs and things but where is that sincerity of so sincere about the word of god and the church of god until it grieves our heart to see sin going on and elijah had come into all of this can we say amen to that it should grieve our hearts we shouldn't just say well they don't believe like us their churches is full of nonsense they don't believe like us it should grieve our heart that satan could deceive a people to think that all kinds of sin and nonsense in the house of god is acceptable i want a holy fire let me just you know i i just want to give clarity in case somebody's listening on the internet or here or whatever i want to give clarity to where i stand i want a sin killing fire of god to flow through this church and i don't mean it just you or you i mean every one of us that it would come through here and quench the hunger and burn the sin out of us amen burn the refiners fire burn us not just give us a little warm where we're uncomfortable burn us melt us down lord because otherwise church we're going to stand as a church together on that day and find out that we came short but i didn't come here to come short you didn't come here to come short we came here because the word is living in us and the word has compelled us hallelujah anything short of that right there is man's works in men's labor and the word says that will fail hallelujah amen he made a challenge to them let the god that is supernatural let him that can show himself alive let him be god if all your theologies he was speaking to them if baal miss god if he can answer let him answer let god that answers let the god that keeps his word be god look my brother and sister you could almost take that over to the devil the devil keeps his word come on come on he makes all kinds of promises here but he's also made a promise behind the back of the people that said i will take you to the lake of fire with me jesus come and said today you'll be with me in paradise satan is right there with his own promise of redemption i'll take you as my bride to the lake of fire and he'll keep that promise oh you better believe it if that isn't a challenge tonight to the world again let the god that keeps his word be god so what happened he called them together and the god of heaven answered in a supernatural sign to israel that he was still the god that could answer by fire and i want to say tonight today that he is still a god that answers by fire today he's using the holy spirit amen and it comes and it moves in our midst my brother and sister it's not paul's preaching it's not david's preaching it's not uh uh anyone's preaching amen it's not brother chris is preaching it's not that's not what brings it up it's god speaking it's god speaking it's god that says you know what this is what i'm going to do this is how it is i'm going to bring this to pass i make a promise to you i speak to your heart i deliver you i provide for you i bless you it's not a man preaching that into your life it's the holy ghost coming down speaking the word out to you oh hallelujah it's funny when you read they criticize the mormons for believing their gods when it's just so absolute close to the truth and the world can't stand that right because for them under that anointing they've got to put god over here behind a curtain once again we can't see him we can't really hear him god doesn't really talk to us then the flip side of that is you got these people anti-word just live in any way and they get up on tv and whatever else and they say and the lord told me you sir leave your wife and marry that woman and if people go out and get a divorce lawyer and say well it was prophetic really it was devilishly prophetic yeah it was their god that's right balaam talking yeah vision challenge tonight the world again let god keeps his word so what happened he called them together the god of heaven answered in a supernatural sign to israel that he was still the god that could answer by fire and he did just what he always did answered prayer kept his word i told you this was a super size quote here amen hallelujah we just now made it to the kingpin amen after all of this still it wasn't sufficient and little old elijah didn't he didn't know what to do so he ran to a juniper tree and those of you in your time of trouble went off and hid and the devil come and said oh aren't you man or woman enough to just stand up no no i want you to follow this we sang a song brother jay you sang it this morning right here amen i can't remember the name of that song but i just about leaped out of my any of you remember right at the moment that i said hallelujah and clap my hands that was a song look at this little elijah he didn't know what to do say run to the juniper tree i'm glad there is a juniper tree all god's peoples needs to go to that juniper tree it's a place where he was so discouraged he didn't know what to do so he ran out to himself god under the juniper tree many of us feel like going there and today when we see the institutions filled with people of god nervous breakdown tension oh it makes us all want to run to the juniper tree i i think we could express it like the old colored lady said down south when she'd been hit by an automobile now tell me there is a little humor in the gospel when you read this hit by an automobile a car had struck her and they asked her if she wanted to sue for damages and she said lousy no child i don't need damage i need repair hallelujah amen i don't care it's a set here let me put it what went through my mind oh the devil drugged me down oh drug me down into the pits of despair and i was the biggest alcoholic i was the biggest fighter the biggest liar the biggest thief i'm sorry you're trying to get damages but i'm here to tell you i was lost but now i am found amen i have had the blood of jesus christ poured over me i know what it feels like i know what grace and mercy feels like hallelujah lousy no child i don't need damage hallelujah oh i'm sorry i just a little something forgive me for my humor and i think that's about the way the church needs tonight is a repair a place under the juniper tree so we can be alone and the prophet that great day how disappointed he was that he had done just exactly what god told him to do and he thought surely if i did that the people would believe it but he come to find out that all the miracles that god told him to perform he did it and still jezebel you want to know how powerful that jezebel spirit is i'll tell you how powerful it is and i hope this don't hurt nobody's feelings it's powerful enough to come bring people into the house of god dressed like they're walking a street it's powerful enough that people who lie cheat and steal would sit in the house of god and give their ill-gotten gains and boast about what they've done for the church it's powerful enough to take the word of god and water it down that the people would walk out saying i said amen to the word of god today without ever catching the revelation of what is preached that's how powerful this spirit is jezebel quite a quite a woman amen not only refused it but she said she would stop his campaign she couldn't have no more of those campaigns she'd cut his head off if he did you see when the devil gets ahold of a person he just this does them awful i've seen it happen saints i i don't even want to go into it but i will put this out young people please listen to me i went to a church not that far from here the town of greenleaf west of caldwell 50 young people in that church and only a little dinky handful of them serve the lord today and the rest my heart goes out so i'm not judging them scattered many of them four or five husbands four or five wives absolute wreck oh it humbles me when i think of the fact i never had the holy ghost i didn't know what i was doing i wanted to do this i tell the story with a little humor i was living in colorado a little girl worked in the mcdonald's cutest little thing you ever saw blonde hair blue eyes all you decide that's wonderful and all she was so friendly to paul and i'm paul finally got his courage up and said hey would you like to go to a movie she reached across the counter patted me on and she goes oh paul i think you misunderstood i i like you love you like a brother now you say what has that got to do with it i would have been there myself but god's grace god's grace god rich in mercy he said i'm not gonna let you go that way so i'm gonna cause you to face rejection and then one day jerry come along and i say this in love and humor one day jerry come along and she said yes i know you had bad breath and i know you wore those shabby clothes and i know this and i know that but i love you anyhow hallelujah and we can say that in humor but i see what it was god said okay you've come to the time this is the one that wasn't you out there this is you here oh hallelujah you see when the devil got a hold to a person he does them awful he thought the signs and the wonders of a living god would be sufficient but it wasn't so elijah's now his heart's broke and he says right here so his poor heart was broke and he ran to the juniper tree for refuge and he laid out there and i can see him leaving his servant many miles behind he went to himself out under the tree all of us have a little place to go when we get in those troubles i've got a little cave that the fbi couldn't find me that i get into and stay in there two three days have to wade up a creek and over a hill and through a branch and go under a tree go down into a cave and there's always somewhere that we can retreat and get in the presence of god again and i believe friends that no man has a right to profess christianity as a christian until he's found such a retreat can i interpret what the prophet of god is talking about without that kind of retreat we retreat into possessing things we retreat into behaviors we retreat into bar stools we retreat into music we retreat into relationships we retreat to something and as a real christian we have a place can we say amen we have a place to retreat to and that's jesus christ in christ alone hallelujah amen there is somewhere that we can retreat get in the presence of god again and i believe friends that no man has a right to profess christianity as a christian until he's found such a retreat they may come a time when men who are worldly trained not godly scent might be able to explain all the supernatural away from the bible you know what time the prophet of god was talking about right here right now the internet is full of people who are explaining away everything amen oh my oh my i want to go there lord but i i just believe i shouldn't amen prophet of god said if you have a question don't do it so they're explained all the supernatural now look at this follow these saints they might be able to satisfy the carnal mind these people on the internet that have all declared you're in a cult sister jerry obviously excluded my granddaughter leah obviously excluded but when's the last time brother paul told you what to do go study it out one of the key elements of a con of a cult is control i can't speak for any other church on the face of the earth but i'll tell you what grace tabernacle is not in a cult we are serving jesus christ as our lord and savior and we are led by the holy ghost and the holy ghost will give the answers that we need we don't need psychology we don't need some mental conception we don't need some guy over here some guy over there we need to get down serious and say lord i would like an answer to my question i would like a direction to my life i would like a solution to my problem because i tell you what if this church ever would turn into some kind of a cult count me out i'm gone i won't even come around to resign i'll just be gone because you see i have a hard enough time to decide what we should do our family much less adding the burden of trying to tell you what to do and i've said this in bad humor before and i say in bad humor and i'm actually repenting to you i've said before if this is a cult i'll go to the back with the offering plate you guys give me all your money on the way out but you know what i don't want the devil to even anoint something like that so i retract that and ask for your forgiveness to ever say that in the house of god we're not inviting no spirit that comes of that persuasion of that behavior we're only going to invite the holy ghost to come into this house to lead us we've been talking preaching about building a house i want to say today emphatically undeniably lord i want you to fill this house nothing else but you lord oh hallelujah amen look they might be able to satisfy the carnal mind that doesn't know god that the days of miracles are passed and no such thing as the holy ghost but if a man has ever had an experience where you met god huh huh come on church amen never had an experience where we met god amen all the theologians in the world could never take that experience away from you you met god face to face and you know what you're talking about oh i'm gonna say something that sounds harsh and i don't mean it too but every one of these people that's come along 20 30 40 years well let's just start at day one to 40 50 60 years and then say no done with this this wasn't that no i'll tell you what it is my brother and sister they never got saved they never had a personal experience with god hallelujah because if they did they would look at this i'm not defending the message as per say but i'm talking about that relationship with god amen they can't walk away from that you met god face to face you know what you're talking about like moses at the sacred sands in the backside of the desert when a man ever meets god upon them sacred sands of that secret place of retreat no devils in hell can ever take that away from him for he knows he talked face to face with god now look i'm sorry but i just got to make point on this you'll see people say and the lord told me and you don't even have to go pray or get deep in the supernatural to go just a second amen just a second that's not what my bible says that's not what the word of god said to me from the word amen and yet they will go and plow and they'll make comments to you you don't know what the holy spirit spoke to me well i'm sorry and i'm not saying this to be derogatory but there was a spirit spoke to you but it wasn't the holy spirit because if it was a holy spirit you would be able to come and you could search this out maybe you need a reference maybe you need to kind of find a guide but you would go in the word and you'd say that voice told me there it is oh thank you lord amen but when they can search it cover to cover and never find something that would support it but yet say it was the lord spoke to me come on saints come on saints that's the day we're living in as i said earlier these times amen we acknowledge it's the times it's the seasons it's coming amen you met god face to face you know what you're talking about amen no devils in hell can ever take that from him for he knows he talked face to face with god they can explain anything they want to you got to love it though when they start explaining the trinity well it's like three distinct persons in one but it's one god and uh no we have no scripture to support it it's complicated now i say that a little bit derogatory but i'm telling you that spirit is strong enough to deceive millions millions saints not just a few quacko's over here all the way from rich and sophisticated to as it were the down and out he deceived in every class and place and continent that's a powerful spirit that's why saints i tell you i'm sorry i'm taking so long this morning that's why i tell you take it back to the word you take it back you don't trust me you don't trust brother david you don't trust brother chris you don't trust brother david nash or brother jose hernandez or any visiting minister it's your soul it's your soul it isn't like you're questioning you're doubting you're afraid it's your job it's your job take it back to the word amen oh you say what are you saying brother paul take it back face to face not a second hand third hand face to face some would say we'd be leaving the prophet behind but i tell you i have quotes where the prophet of god said that there will be young mens come someday they'll carry this word on he didn't say i'll have mechanical things or all of this other he declared young men would come and the word of god the word of god declares it also my brother and sister they can explain anything they want to but you were there when it happened and you know what you speak of hallelujah can someone say amen to that hallelujah now look at this come on i got to get closing uh the prophet told us pray for revelation yes sir i told you i want to bring this right back i want to bring this about i told you earlier i want to bring this back around we're taught to pray for revelation but i tell you what i want you to do i want you to pray just as your brother i'm not making a doctrine out of this i want you to pray that the lord would reveal the spirit of your situation to you amen come on the spirit on your situation that the spirit of the situation would be revealed to you some of us wouldn't be nearly so excited about the situations around us amen if we actually saw the spirit yes sir oh hallelujah let me just go on now i already hit this about the statue of the perfect man i'm just going to skip over it but i'm telling you my brother and sister spiritual growth is a struggle don't think you're going to sit on these church pews right here and just somehow just grow spiritually you're going to have to struggle amen if i could emphasize i actually forgot to ask the brothers if they could put up the statue of a perfect man but i want to emphasize to you my brother and sister in a very expanded way that the statue of perfect man would be like these steps and like your newborn baby imagine your newborn baby trying to climb up these steps near impossible but as your newborn feeds on the word and he grows then pretty soon i hope i hope i won't speak out a turn but pretty soon he'll be like little sammy at the grace kids and this is a couple times ago they had some desserts far on the counter he got up in that chair and he's leaning forward he's trying to reach it he can't quite reach it so he said i have a solution i'm going to get up on my own two feet come on i hope you follow me he didn't say mama he did look around see brother paul was watching him and i think he was thinking what's he gonna do and i hate to admit this in public but i'm thinking well i'm already slid over into a grandfather's spirit give him the sugar sister yulia i'm sorry to tell on your son brother sergey but i thought it was pretty funny because he looked around and all he saw was me watching him he just climbed up on the counter and i don't mean he climbed up on and crawled over to that food he climbed up and walked over there and bent over and got what he wanted hallelujah and i'm telling you i thought isn't that the truth of how it is there was a day you couldn't make it up the steps of the stature of a perfect man but then the day comes and we're growing and we're growing and we're growing and pretty soon we're not stopped down here at the bottom saying oh praise the lord this has been revealed to me we're looking up lord i want that up there now lord if i've got to climb if i've got to do whatever's necessary i'm going to get that amen little sammy became an inspiration of a fought hallelujah stature of a perfect man we can sit there and lean over the banister as it were of heaven and say lord if you just give that to me or we can say it's there somebody has prepared it it's in front of me and i know that i want that i desire that i believe that is for me and then we get up and we start marching we start climbing we start moving up my brother and sister and we don't sit back and say well if the lord wants me to be a better christian we are here something inside of us saying i want to be i want to be your word manifested i want to be the witness of this age i want to be the word in flesh that's what i want to be lord and i'm going to press to the mark of the high calling until i become what my heart's desire is oh hallelujah but i'm telling you you were there when it happened and you want to know what you're talking about amen now look at this hallelujah oh my more quotes one more please please okay now look at this prophet's talking here in the seventh church ages smyrning church age now my brother and sister there's a lot that goes with this in front of this behind i encourage you to go read a lot right there but he comes down here now and he says now comes our triumphal capstone on the baptism of the holy ghost galatians 4 4 7. but when the fullness of time was come the fullness for that time right or this time see it'd be easy to say okay um yeah that was back there but when the fullness of time was come god sent forth his son made of a woman made under the law to redeem them that were under the law that we might receive the adoption of sons and because ye are sons god has sent forth the spirit of his son into your hearts crying abba father wherefore they are no more a servant but a son and if a son then made an heir of god through christ you know you know what this tells me saints when this speaks to me i have and i want to apply this can i just beforehand get you to agree that this would apply to you you don't even know what i'm talking about but i want you to agree i have no inheritance in satan's house i have nothing i don't want a toothpick i don't even want the lint behind the curtains i want nothing out of satan's house because you see i've been called into adoption to receive oh hallelujah and because because he sent forth the spirit of his son into my heart into your heart hallelujah crying abba father what is it my father my father it's not just him people are like well predestination i'll serve god because of predestination you've missed the mark of predestination god put a desire it's not god oh this is for next service i'll repeat it amen it's not for god to make you go to do that but god put something that seed down in your heart and soul that is so strong it is so hungry there's where it is that he makes you to dwell in the heavenlies people say well god can't make you oh yes he can not strong-armed but he puts a desire in there that is so strong that you find yourself compelled compelled hallelujah i hope you got that because that's actually not by my words my brother and sister but that's actually pretty deep when the holy spirit can compel you that it actually makes you rise up from your current woe is me and press into the word of god hallelujah can i finish part two this morning see now you're no more you're no more a servant but a son and if a son and heir of god through christ there it is jesus christ come forth died upon the cross and accomplished redemption restoring to the original owner by means of purchase or paying the price and hereby placed us as sons look at this saints it's right here this is beautiful he did not make us sons for we were already his sons but he placed us as sons for as long as we were in the world in the flesh oh my that flesh got to die now we could not be recognized oh who wants to be recognized as sons and daughters of god amen hallelujah i don't want them to recognize me of some religious person or some this or that i want to be recognized as a son of god hallelujah placed as his sons amen we were held captive by the devil that's right oh my sister emmy come i've got to i've got to we're held captive by the devil but we were sons nonetheless and hear this and hear this because ye our sons god has sent forth the spirit of his son into your heart whereby i'm going to add a couple words in there whereby you can cry my father my father this is not just words to us my brother and sister this is the heart's cry of the bride of christ father father upon whom did the spirit fall at pentecost sons at corinth upon sons while they heard the word oh hallelujah oh hallelujah now look at this i want to share a little something side note sunday school maybe it'll speak to you in the king james you'll find that in other versions of the bible they have changed words substituted used words in different fashion but in king james the word defeat appears two times in the bible niv and different ones they take the word smote [Music] and put defeat in that place but you see my brother and sister defeat is to be a conqueror victorious smote actually means to strike with a firm blow so look what they've done by watering the bible down niv in a bunch of these different versions they have not made you a conqueror they just said you took a swipe at the devil and you think reading the word of god don't affect you i'm here to take the word that says i defeated him amen i'm not here just taking a swipe at the devil that means he's alive to come back and and and do what he does but i want to defeat this devil amen i want him done but look these two times the word defeat appears in in king james second samuel 15 34 2nd samuel 17 14 and both of these are concerning absalom god declaring i've come to defeat the spirit i'm paraphrasing i've come to defeat the plans and the spirit of absalom he didn't just take a swipe at the spirit of absalom he defeated it oh hallelujah now look my brother and sister if the lord would just put that bird in there two times in the king james version i don't want you as your pastor i want to encourage you i want you to think about it don't use that word don't let the spirit of that word come upon you we are here as overcomers of the word we are overcomers of the age that we live in the spirits of it and the word in us is more than able hallelujah can we say amen i'm more than able hallelujah okay i don't want to sound like i'm lying to you but here's here we're done right here amen i want you to take this scripture with you hold on to it tight deuteronomy 31 6 be strong and of good courage fear not nor be afraid of covid of the government of laodicea of the antichrist come on see didn't didn't put any limitations on this don't be afraid of them what are the what are thems what are thems any spirit that's not subject to the word of god is the thems for the lord thy god now do you realize how direct that is that couldn't be spoken to a mixed group of believers the lord thy god he it is that doth go with thee he will not fail thee nor forsake me hallelujah oh my oh my saints hallelujah i wouldn't have brought the whole buffet if i hadn't thought i could have preached it but praise the lord let's just stand and sing a song or two before we dismiss the more that i surrender come help me brother jason oh [Music] that i surrendered [Music] the more he takes control the more that i can timed with myself the more he lifts me up every day i live [Music] to understand this road i'm traveling down [Music] oh don't you like that no more waverings i'm standing on solid ground and i know i'm headed to my picture home and the voice i hear is yours alone every day i live [Music] worship him saints the lighter my lord for more than i release my cares the more you take control and the more that i can humble myself the more you lift me up every day i live oh lord i love you more look at this sermon right here the problems i had yesterday are now stepping stones to a higher place the trials that seem so awesome to me are now my banners of victory and i know i'm headed to my future home and the voice i hear is yours alone every day i live lord i love you more oh the more that i [Music] surrender my [Music] the more you take control the more that i can humble myself the more you lift me up every day i live lord i love you more hallelujah blessed be the lord god almighty and then we're going to dismiss after this brother chris i believe is probably getting ready what a privilege is brothers and sisters in christ see god's moving in our young people god's stirring hearts it's not an intellectual conception but there's something so beautiful about seeing a young person start to get those nuggets of the word start to realize i have no inheritance in satan's house all of my inheritance is in the house of god that's where i'm going to dwell all the days of my life is in the house of the lord let's sing this father in heaven we love you we lift your name in all the earth may your kingdom be established in our praises as your people declare your mighty words blessed be the lord almighty who was in his and is to come blessed be the lord god almighty who lives forever more oh father in heaven i love you i lift your name in all the earth may your kingdom be established in my praises as your people to declare your mighty word oh blessed be the lord god almighty [Applause] was it is to come blessed be the lord god almighty [Music] hallelujah let's just very carefully just all go down and witness this lovely blessing that the lord has given us today god bless you saints pray as the word has come forth maybe something touch your heart but i just want to remind you god would have never called you if he hadn't provided the way for you keep pressing in the way don't stop amen i don't care how rough life is god's there with you amen the character being molded you'll wake up another day and say thank you lord that you strengthened me and i'm ready for the challenge of my day god bless you saints hallelujah so [Music] so [Music] so [Music] so you
