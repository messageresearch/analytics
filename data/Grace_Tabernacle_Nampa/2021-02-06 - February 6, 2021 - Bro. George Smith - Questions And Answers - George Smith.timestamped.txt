[20:19] to have each one of you here tonight
[20:22] um i just want to say a quick word uh
[20:25] there has been a quite a response for
[20:28] questions
[20:29] and um i saw brother george today
[20:33] going through studying looking in his
[20:35] bible
[20:36] going through these notes and i just
[20:38] want to put this out to you tonight
[20:41] if your question does not get brought up
[20:43] tonight
[20:44] there is probably more questions then we
[20:47] have time
[20:48] so i just encourage each one if your
[20:51] question
[20:51] uh is is not spoke of tonight
[20:55] and you desire an answer uh we will
[20:59] we will give those get those answers for
[21:01] you so just kind of a little warning
[21:03] that
[21:04] brother george has quite quite a list a
[21:07] quite a pile of
[21:08] of of questions to answer tonight and so
[21:12] having said that i just want to give
[21:14] full liberty to brother george just to
[21:16] come
[21:17] what god has laid upon his heart and
[21:21] um would you did you have another song
[21:23] work it
[21:24] we're good liberty we've got liberty
[21:27] okay okay i kind of misunderstood i
[21:30] didn't tell i looked down on the list
[21:31] and i see another song on there
[21:34] listen yeah well anyway
[21:37] let's just give plenty of time to
[21:38] brother george let's just welcome him
[21:40] this evening
[21:42] uh amen um
[21:45] i have i just want to just say this
[21:47] quick note i have
[21:48] had the privilege and i do consider it
[21:50] that i i'm not very good
[21:52] at lifting men up and putting them on
[21:54] pedestals it never works right
[21:56] but i have uh been overseas with brother
[22:00] george i have
[22:01] uh seen his approach to the people uh
[22:04] and um you know he has given me this
[22:08] compliment
[22:09] and i want to give it back to him what
[22:11] you see is what you get
[22:14] amen and and i think that's quite
[22:17] special myself
[22:18] i say that as a compliment so
[22:21] you know we don't have another brother
[22:23] george out here and another brother
[22:25] george here it's the same man
[22:27] morning noon and night seven days a week
[22:29] all 12 months of the year
[22:31] so let's just open our hearts and and
[22:33] just lift him up this evening in the
[22:34] name of the lord amen
[22:37] thank you brother paul
[22:43] there's only one brother paul also so
[22:46] we're thankful
[22:48] but i'm glad that he has invited me back
[22:50] after two and a half years
[22:52] and i i was kind of waiting to get see
[22:55] if the house got finished
[22:57] you know but i just got tired of waiting
[23:03] so it's good to be here and we're um
[23:07] we're going to get right into these
[23:09] questions we've already sung we've
[23:11] prayed
[23:12] and uh lovely music i'm glad it's
[23:15] under control not like some places i've
[23:17] been
[23:18] and but i've had a few
[23:24] well a few hours because i got here when
[23:26] friday
[23:28] friday night you know so we had
[23:29] yesterday or today today saturday
[23:32] see when you're having fun all that good
[23:34] pie it's just time flies
[23:37] but um we're glad to be here and i don't
[23:39] have all the answers
[23:40] but we'll see if the answers are in the
[23:43] word
[23:44] now some are scriptural questions and
[23:47] some are
[23:49] so we should say nosy questions
[23:52] but it's okay to laugh in church
[23:56] this is it's better than the alternative
[24:02] so let's see here where where did you
[24:05] and sister rebecca
[24:06] first meet well uh the testimony is
[24:10] online you can see it anytime you please
[24:13] but we met in tucson arizona and uh
[24:17] i was already living there and
[24:21] because my mother was born there and
[24:23] anyway ended up there finishing up high
[24:25] school
[24:26] and then all of a sudden this family
[24:28] moves to town
[24:29] from far away and you know
[24:33] it's obvious when somebody comes in here
[24:35] that's not from here right
[24:37] well they had this southern indiana
[24:39] accent
[24:41] and um so yeah it was pretty much i
[24:44] thought it was love at first sight
[24:46] i had to convince her but you know she's
[24:48] not here to defend herself
[24:51] did you feel you had to pray about her
[24:53] being the right one or did
[24:55] you know as soon as you met her well
[24:58] that's a tricky question honey that was
[25:00] over 60 years ago
[25:02] and uh i wasn't taught to really pray
[25:05] about those things i just
[25:07] saw the most beautiful woman you know it
[25:10] was like paul you know
[25:12] but i was a baptist you know and they
[25:15] were in a different church
[25:17] and so there was some prayer um
[25:20] it seems holiness is rarely preached
[25:23] anymore
[25:24] and i will assume this person isn't from
[25:25] this church or they haven't been paying
[25:27] attention
[25:29] do you feel it should be preached as
[25:31] according to god's word
[25:32] and the message of the hour the answer
[25:35] is yes
[25:36] should be okay
[25:39] now these aren't in any particular order
[25:41] like you said yours might get left out
[25:42] but we're going to try
[25:45] please explain the wave sheath well the
[25:48] wave sheath
[25:49] was something they had in the old
[25:50] testament this was the first
[25:52] it was the example and of course there's
[25:56] a whole lot more to this if you ask this
[25:57] question to brother david we might be
[25:59] here till
[25:59] 11 30. so there's a reason they use me
[26:03] because they know i'm leaving monday
[26:08] is the wave chief in this last day the
[26:10] bride since she is him
[26:12] uh i would consider the wave chief to be
[26:15] william branham's ministry he was the
[26:16] example of what we're supposed to be
[26:19] and uh that's all in the message which
[26:21] brings us to another point
[26:24] has anybody not seen this book raise
[26:25] your hand
[26:28] okay this is called the resume of the
[26:31] seven church ages this is chapter 10
[26:33] out of this book here
[26:38] and if you can't get it out of the
[26:39] deacons tell them you want it and i'll
[26:41] send you some more
[26:42] but this is the seven church ages it's
[26:44] in readable fashion
[26:46] and every home should have at least one
[26:47] copy
[26:49] and a lot of these things are covered in
[26:51] there
[26:53] what kind of relationship did you have
[26:55] with brother branham
[26:56] well let's just say i was very careful
[26:59] because here's a man that
[27:00] could see through you and
[27:04] was i going to pull a fast one i don't
[27:05] think so
[27:07] uh i didn't know who it was i'd never
[27:10] knew this name before you know they
[27:13] moved arizona and lived a
[27:14] block from my house and um
[27:17] so before i could get close to the girl
[27:19] i had to meet the man you know
[27:22] and so in our first encounter
[27:25] we're just two guys talking i'm there to
[27:27] ask permission to get to know her better
[27:30] he's checking me out because that's his
[27:32] firstborn and
[27:33] kind of protective you know um but i
[27:36] later
[27:37] realized that what he was doing he was
[27:39] scanning the hard drive
[27:42] you know down there all the way and so
[27:46] yeah i was very careful
[27:48] since the two seeds are so close
[27:53] now this is referring to matthew 24 24
[27:56] do you think brother branham knew it
[27:57] would be within the message itself yes i
[28:00] believe he knew that
[28:01] where else is it going to come from it's
[28:02] got to be very close
[28:05] something almost deceives the very elect
[28:08] which means it'll deceive everything
[28:10] that's not elect
[28:13] let's see here how often do we
[28:17] as a christian have to pay our tithes
[28:20] is it monthly or every time we get paid
[28:24] well good question
[28:28] the fact is you should pay your tithes
[28:30] as soon as possible
[28:32] because this is borrowed money that 10
[28:36] is not yours to start with
[28:39] so god is trusting you with a hundred
[28:41] dollars but only 90
[28:42] 90 of it's yours now i was standing
[28:46] there one day
[28:47] in the yard when this man drove up from
[28:49] california to arizona
[28:52] and he came for one purpose that's to
[28:54] pay brother branham his tithes
[28:56] and he said and i've already added the
[28:58] 20
[28:59] and over half of you don't know that's
[29:01] bible
[29:02] but this man had been keeping his titles
[29:06] waiting for whatever time to pay it and
[29:09] the scripture says if you
[29:11] keep your tithes and don't pay it right
[29:13] away then you add 20 percent
[29:17] bible and so uh he'd already added that
[29:20] in
[29:20] brother brown accepted it blessed him
[29:22] and he went on
[29:23] now there's another tithe story that is
[29:25] worth mentioning
[29:28] uh well two actually brother brahm told
[29:29] me himself he said now george tithing is
[29:32] one thing i know
[29:33] works so there's no question
[29:38] there's a man he's gone now but there
[29:40] was a man in east texas
[29:42] his name was r.g letourneau and
[29:45] everybody over 50 probably knows that
[29:47] name
[29:48] he was a manufacturer of earth moving
[29:52] equipment
[29:53] this was before caterpillar and
[29:57] during the second world war seventy
[30:00] percent of all the earth moving
[30:01] equipment used in the war came from his
[30:03] factory
[30:05] and he had a very christian attitude
[30:08] about things
[30:09] he started paying 10 percent they
[30:11] started to start paying 20 percent
[30:14] and eventually he was paying 90 percent
[30:16] to the mission field
[30:17] and living on 10 percent it does work
[30:22] the scripture says try me see if i can
[30:24] see if you can help
[30:25] out do me you know so yeah tithing is
[30:29] very
[30:29] important um
[30:33] let's see here what is the difference
[30:37] of being a prophet and having the gift
[30:40] of prophecy
[30:41] well prophets are born prophets
[30:45] now in the case of brother branham and
[30:46] probably all the others but that's the
[30:47] one we can focus on uh even though he
[30:50] was born a prophet
[30:52] it didn't really amount to much until he
[30:54] was fully surrendered
[30:56] there's nothing magic about it you have
[30:57] to there's parts you've got to put into
[30:59] it
[30:59] whereas a gift of prophecy is something
[31:02] you know you can god gives those
[31:03] sovereignly
[31:05] and a person is prayed for just like a
[31:07] gift of singing or whatever
[31:09] uh if you're you know aiming in that
[31:11] direction then it starts manifesting
[31:14] the ministry blesses you and it works
[31:17] and there's a lot more that can be said
[31:19] about these things and we'll leave these
[31:21] with
[31:23] brother paul so he can expound on him
[31:26] uh why was rebecca a prophetess even
[31:30] though
[31:31] she was a woman well
[31:34] good question now this is deborah
[31:38] okay i think this is a probably a child
[31:40] who wrote this that's good
[31:41] why was deborah a prophetess even though
[31:43] she was a woman
[31:44] well you can go read in judges chapter 4
[31:47] and chapter 5.
[31:48] it was god's design see we don't argue
[31:51] well god why did you do this
[31:53] we'd like for the sun to come up in the
[31:54] north tomorrow it's not going to happen
[31:57] but there's people that kind of have
[31:58] that mentality you know so whatever god
[32:01] says
[32:01] it works but chapter four and five of
[32:04] judges has the answer for you
[32:06] uh why did israelites
[32:10] make war if the commandments told them
[32:13] not to kill also chapter four and five
[32:16] of judges
[32:18] see israel just like america was blessed
[32:21] and they're blessed and they're blessed
[32:23] then they forgot where the blessings
[32:24] come from and they started into idolatry
[32:26] and then god sends the enemies go down
[32:29] and punish them
[32:30] they go down there slaughter a few
[32:32] people other times god says the
[32:34] israelites go kill all those people over
[32:35] there
[32:36] it's just the way god ordained things to
[32:38] be and we don't question
[32:40] but god has ways of doing things that
[32:44] we don't know just yes lord thy will be
[32:47] done
[32:50] okay did mary did joseph and mary have
[32:52] children besides
[32:54] jesus yes open your bibles mark
[32:57] 13 um
[33:00] where we at here matthew 13 i'm sorry
[33:04] and verse 55
[33:07] where the bible says
[33:12] see here matthew 13
[33:15] 55
[33:18] is not this the carpenter's son
[33:21] it's not his mother called mary and his
[33:23] brethren james
[33:25] joseph simon judas
[33:28] and his sisters ah
[33:31] so there was a big family yeah
[33:35] jesus was the firstborn and the others
[33:38] was our lord jesus baptized in the name
[33:41] of jesus according to acts 2 38 i don't
[33:43] think so
[33:44] acts 2 38 wasn't written yet
[33:47] or how was he baptized by john the
[33:49] baptist well
[33:51] if you read in uh uh let's see where's
[33:54] it at john chapter one
[33:56] let's go there real quick john chapter
[34:00] one
[34:02] and uh verse 28.
[34:07] we have the account of when jesus came
[34:10] to the water
[34:11] now remember these two were second
[34:13] cousins
[34:14] because mary and elizabeth were cousins
[34:16] so these are second cousins
[34:18] and we don't know how close they were
[34:20] during their childhood but in
[34:22] math in john 1 28
[34:27] these things were done in bethlehem
[34:29] beyond jordan where john was baptizing
[34:31] the next day john sees jesus coming unto
[34:34] him
[34:35] and said behold the lamb of god which
[34:37] taketh away to the sin of the world
[34:39] this is he of whom i have already told
[34:41] you after
[34:42] me cometh a man which is preferred
[34:44] before me
[34:45] for he was before me and i knew him not
[34:49] but that he should
[34:50] be made manifest to israel therefore i
[34:53] am
[34:54] come baptizing with water in other words
[34:56] he was the forerunner
[34:57] and john bear record saying i saw the
[34:59] spirit descending him from heaven like a
[35:01] dove
[35:01] and a boat upon him and i knew him not
[35:04] but
[35:04] he that sent me to baptize with water
[35:07] the same said unto me
[35:08] upon whom thou shalt see the spirit
[35:10] descending and remaining on him
[35:13] the same is he which baptizes with the
[35:15] holy ghost
[35:16] so john is there baptizing doing his you
[35:19] know
[35:20] ministry and jesus comes to him now they
[35:23] had a little bit of discussions in
[35:24] another chapter
[35:26] oh john says you know i'm oh it's you i
[35:28] saw the dove
[35:30] i should be baptized of you no you're
[35:32] going to baptize me
[35:34] because that's what it should be the
[35:35] sacrifice had to be washed before it was
[35:37] offered
[35:39] so i don't know what formula john the
[35:41] baptist used it was in acts 2 38 okay
[35:44] so get that clear please tell us how
[35:47] brother braham told you
[35:49] you had received the holy ghost well
[35:51] that's also
[35:52] on the uh internet but it was real
[35:55] simple i was
[35:56] in beaumont texas way down on the coast
[36:00] in a small church about this size
[36:03] and it was just three brothers me and
[36:05] brother perry and brother
[36:06] richard blair were but just kneeling in
[36:09] a bench praying
[36:11] now brother brahm knew i was there he
[36:13] was in arizona a thousand miles away
[36:15] and he had told brother perry the week
[36:17] before it looks like this kid's gonna be
[36:19] my son-in-law take him home
[36:20] pray for the holy ghost why didn't
[36:23] brother bran just put his hand on me you
[36:25] know with it
[36:25] well that wasn't god's program okay so i
[36:28] go off
[36:29] and i'm over there and that morning
[36:32] because i don't know why i'm there they
[36:33] didn't tell me why i was going i thought
[36:35] i was on vacation
[36:36] you know i was just a kid 18 years old
[36:40] and so
[36:43] that morning brother blair had come over
[36:46] to brother perry's house to use his
[36:47] phone
[36:48] to call brother branham in arizona but
[36:51] when he called brother branham was
[36:52] already out of the house
[36:53] so they said we'll take your name and
[36:55] we'll have him call you when he comes
[36:56] back
[36:57] okay so these two are sitting by the
[36:59] phone waiting for it to ring all day
[37:00] and i'm over in my room reading the
[37:02] bible so i thought well
[37:05] two brothers maybe we'll just pray
[37:07] together so we come over and we're
[37:08] praying
[37:09] and so while we're praying um
[37:12] i remember very well that you know with
[37:15] my eyes closed it was like kind of like
[37:17] today or some days when it's kind of a
[37:18] cloudy sky there's
[37:20] there's breaks in the clouds you know
[37:22] sun shining through these
[37:23] like shafts of light and um
[37:26] and so then right away the phone rang so
[37:29] brother perry goes to answer his phone
[37:31] and uh it's brother branham and he was
[37:33] calling for for the other brother
[37:36] and so he says but first let me talk to
[37:38] george okay so i go and
[37:39] read him he says now look george i want
[37:41] to be the first to congratulate you on
[37:43] receiving the baptism of the holy ghost
[37:46] oh so that's what that was all about so
[37:48] he was identifying
[37:50] what had happened you know because he
[37:53] knew i was kind of hard-headed you know
[37:54] like
[37:55] some other people we know and so he uh
[37:58] he identified it
[37:59] so all these years later it's not so
[38:00] much that he identified
[38:02] but that it actually happened and it's
[38:04] got bigger every day
[38:06] so that's the way that was simple as
[38:08] that
[38:09] some people have different kind of
[38:10] sensations you know the are pentecostal
[38:12] friends because somebody backed their
[38:14] spoken tongues
[38:14] well then everybody well i've seen all
[38:17] kinds of people
[38:18] speak in tongues they had no more holy
[38:19] ghost than nothing so that's
[38:21] one of the evidences but it's not a
[38:23] pattern that everybody has to follow
[38:25] you know okay let's see what we've got
[38:28] here
[38:28] um what is serpent seed
[38:32] okay good question uh genesis 3
[38:36] verse 14 is right here
[38:41] genesis 3 14 and 15 and the lord god
[38:44] said unto the serpent because
[38:46] thou has done this so for all of you
[38:49] that think that
[38:51] first of all a serpent here is not a
[38:54] snake
[38:56] serpent was an upright being that could
[38:59] reason could talk to because you've
[39:01] already talked to him over here in the
[39:02] other part of the chapter
[39:04] now god's talking to him now serpent
[39:07] because you did this you're cursed of
[39:10] all the cattle
[39:12] very beast of the field upon thy belly
[39:14] shalt thou go
[39:15] and thus shalt thou eat all the days of
[39:17] thy life and i will put enmity
[39:19] in other words kind of like a hatred
[39:21] between you
[39:22] and the woman and between thy seed
[39:26] so there's the serpent's seed and her
[39:28] seed
[39:29] and it shall bruise thy head and thou
[39:31] shall bruise his heel
[39:33] so that is where the serpent's
[39:36] seed is brother brahm didn't make it up
[39:39] it's in the bible
[39:40] from way back you see and uh you can
[39:43] read the whole story in chapter three
[39:45] to see what he did and so forth um
[39:49] and there's another question about this
[39:50] little later
[39:52] was cain hybrid because he was a cross
[39:55] between serpent
[39:56] and human yeah he was a hybrid
[39:59] definitely how was jesus
[40:03] all man and all god well he was the only
[40:06] person that ever was he was born of
[40:09] woman
[40:10] without sex mystery he was a kinsmen
[40:14] redeemer
[40:14] had to be you know a blood relative of
[40:16] ours
[40:17] um at lazarus tomb
[40:21] he was very human when he cried because
[40:23] his friend had died
[40:24] but he was very god when he said lazarus
[40:26] come forth
[40:28] and he walked out so he was also tempted
[40:32] in all ways like us
[40:34] and he could have had a wife and
[40:35] children but he didn't
[40:38] so yeah he was all man he was all god
[40:42] says here uh quote follow after charity
[40:45] and desire
[40:46] spiritual gifts but rather that you may
[40:49] prophesy first corinthians 14 1.
[40:52] in the context of this verse what gifts
[40:55] should we desire
[40:57] well everybody's cut out different now
[40:59] you that have more than two children you
[41:01] know that they're all
[41:02] different got the same kind of blood
[41:06] um but each one has to pray
[41:09] and seek the mind of the lord for your
[41:11] individual life
[41:13] and when you know that god has revealed
[41:15] when god is doing something for you
[41:17] then you go with that you see and uh
[41:22] psalm 46 10 says be still i'm god
[41:26] i know all the details there are no
[41:28] surprises for me i got it all under
[41:29] control
[41:30] so you just look to god for the answer
[41:33] and he will show you what you should do
[41:35] everybody can't stand up here with a
[41:37] microphone everybody can't play the
[41:39] piano
[41:40] but you have a position in the body to
[41:42] make it work right
[41:44] it's like these nice cars will get
[41:46] outside
[41:48] the rubber tire is one thing but the
[41:50] steering wheel is different
[41:52] the computer is different all these
[41:54] little pieces make it go you know
[41:56] so god will direct and uh show you what
[41:58] you should be what you should
[42:00] desire why does it matter what a
[42:03] person's name means
[42:06] well if it didn't matter
[42:09] why doesn't anybody call their little
[42:10] girl sapphira
[42:14] you know any little boys called ananias
[42:16] no
[42:17] although there's several in the bible
[42:19] some one was a real good one
[42:22] there was a case in venezuela
[42:25] which i used to go to a lot but hadn't
[42:26] been there in about five years
[42:28] but i got down there and they were
[42:30] having some kind of a youth camp and
[42:31] this one girl comes up and she said
[42:32] brother swords i need prayer
[42:34] what's the matter well you know my
[42:36] mother doesn't treat me right and
[42:37] she had all kinds of problems you know
[42:40] and so i said well what is your name
[42:41] anyway
[42:43] they all know me and i don't know who
[42:44] they are and she said well my name is
[42:46] bethsaida
[42:48] aha strike one in the scriptures
[42:52] jesus went to every little town and
[42:54] village praying and healing the sick and
[42:55] so forth
[42:56] but there was three villages that just
[42:59] didn't believe
[43:00] there's just a bunch of hardheads you
[43:02] know one was bethsaida one's quartz him
[43:05] and one was capernaum where he spent a
[43:07] lot of time
[43:08] so i think it's in matthew 26 i think
[43:11] where he cursed them
[43:13] because you didn't believe cursed be
[43:16] now time went on like nothing's
[43:19] happening
[43:21] 60 years later comes the earthquake and
[43:23] destroys capernaum
[43:25] a bunch of rocks today since 1900
[43:29] 1909 along in there israel's been back
[43:31] and they've been rebuilding
[43:32] everything's been rebuilt there's a
[43:34] there's life everywhere except those
[43:36] three places
[43:38] they know the bible says it believe it
[43:42] so back to the point so i said well
[43:45] what's your other name
[43:46] well my other name is esther well
[43:48] starting right now you are esther
[43:50] you're no more bethsaida but you know
[43:52] they saw this name in the bible that
[43:54] looks pretty good
[43:55] not considering what it meant the
[43:58] meaning behind it and what it
[43:59] represented
[44:00] and so her life started changing you
[44:02] know she got a boyfriend and things
[44:04] worked out
[44:05] okay so be careful what you call your
[44:08] children
[44:10] it makes a big difference we don't call
[44:12] them
[44:13] ricky and elvis and all these crazy
[44:16] names you know
[44:17] because we have a history you know um
[44:21] i know a man he's gone now but uh he was
[44:24] a pastor in venezuela
[44:27] and his name was adolf
[44:30] well you know he lived with it and
[44:33] swallowed hard
[44:34] but um he was in the barber chair one
[44:37] day
[44:38] and there was a rabbi getting trimmed up
[44:40] a little bit
[44:41] so he thought here's my big chance you
[44:43] know they keep records of all these
[44:45] names and
[44:46] so he starts talking with him and
[44:49] he uh you know actually about the name
[44:51] adolf the guy said
[44:53] well it's not in our books we don't
[44:56] wouldn't have nothing to do with the
[44:57] name adolf
[44:58] he said yeah my dad was a big fan of his
[45:00] and that's why he named me and so forth
[45:03] so you know he uh but the interesting
[45:06] thing was
[45:06] after this man been preaching the
[45:08] message for 32 years
[45:10] he was a good friend of mine we we could
[45:13] share
[45:13] shoes and everything you know and um
[45:16] and he was a good preacher but when he
[45:19] got to talking to this rabbi
[45:22] um they got to you know talking they're
[45:25] both preachers you know both with no
[45:26] word
[45:27] and so it all starts telling him yeah
[45:30] you know god sent a prophet wait a
[45:31] minute
[45:32] wait a minute prophets are only for the
[45:34] jews
[45:35] and that turned him right there and he
[45:38] went off
[45:39] eventually got killed just on
[45:42] this man's word after preaching the
[45:43] message for 32 years
[45:46] but we don't blame that on his name but
[45:48] just the fact that
[45:50] uh he didn't have a real revelation
[45:52] apparently you know
[45:53] he could have called one of us and maybe
[45:55] helped a little bit no
[45:57] okay so yeah names mean things
[46:01] um what else you got here
[46:05] why was the meaning of each child from
[46:08] jacob's wives and concubines important
[46:11] well it was god ordained i don't know i
[46:13] wasn't there but
[46:14] they are important quote take heed that
[46:17] you despise not one of these little ones
[46:19] for i say unto you that in heaven their
[46:21] angels do always behold the face of my
[46:24] father
[46:24] which is in heaven matthew 18 10.
[46:28] what does it mean by their angels well
[46:30] every
[46:31] child from the minutes born has a
[46:33] guardian angel
[46:35] we all have a guardian angel and that's
[46:38] what that means
[46:38] there's an angel that watches after us
[46:40] and that's that's why
[46:42] when you try to make a left turn out of
[46:44] where it only says right turn
[46:46] have we all done it you feel a bit
[46:49] well that's the guardian angel telling
[46:50] you straighten up
[46:52] uh all kinds of situations yeah
[46:57] how did sin come back after the flood
[47:00] well
[47:00] i'm sure there's some real good
[47:02] theologians here but i'm
[47:04] i'm believing it came through one of the
[47:05] wives of you know
[47:08] the daughters-in-law
[47:11] is it considered divorce if an
[47:13] engagement is broken
[47:15] well that depends there's different
[47:18] cases
[47:19] brother bram never dealt with it from
[47:21] the pulpit he said
[47:23] i'll see you in the back room and he
[47:25] discerned the case
[47:26] there are cases where it's admitted and
[47:29] cases where it's not
[47:32] when does friendship become courtship
[47:35] you want to answer that brother paul
[47:40] it's when you want to be closer to her
[47:42] friend is somebody okay see you later
[47:44] but you want you know all you people
[47:47] that have been in love
[47:48] you know that don't you
[47:54] what determines the laws and scriptures
[47:56] we follow
[47:58] from old testament and the ones we don't
[48:01] well some of these things were for the
[48:03] jews only
[48:05] you see and some were carried over into
[48:08] grace
[48:09] i know there's a big argument in some of
[48:10] the people because they well that was
[48:12] old testament we don't have to pay
[48:13] tithes
[48:15] okay go ahead see how your life works
[48:18] out
[48:19] uh we needed a profit to point these
[48:21] things out straighten it up for us
[48:24] and uh that's where the you know the
[48:25] tithing comes in also
[48:28] brother branham addresses the high the
[48:31] higher levels of modesty in the message
[48:33] like don't cut your hair
[48:35] but that doesn't keep some people from
[48:37] you know trimming it and it just keeps
[48:38] coming up and up
[48:40] or not wearing makeup that didn't stop a
[48:42] lot of people
[48:43] but those things are easily understood
[48:46] what about the more
[48:47] gray areas of clothing for boys and
[48:50] girls
[48:52] well if you've got the holy ghost that
[48:54] directs things
[48:56] you know um
[48:59] god made you the way you are whether
[49:01] you're you know
[49:02] seven years old or 95 god made you the
[49:06] way you are
[49:07] but satan is filling the stores so you
[49:10] got to use some sense and some holy
[49:12] ghost
[49:13] to buy what is appropriate
[49:16] but it's amazing at this late date to
[49:18] realize
[49:19] that some people don't know what's
[49:20] appropriate
[49:22] so if you have a problem i'll come back
[49:24] and we'll go shopping
[49:28] but anything that you put on that
[49:31] attracts
[49:31] the eyeballs of the other people you got
[49:34] a problem
[49:35] you know boy or girl over there where i
[49:39] live
[49:39] they call it skinny jeans
[49:43] watch out you're taking people to hell
[49:46] when you dress like that
[49:48] what kind of standard did brother
[49:50] branham expect of his wife and children
[49:52] well he expected holiness and
[49:55] something that's appropriate and he
[49:58] would tell them go back and get dressed
[50:00] you know something that would reflect
[50:03] jesus christ
[50:04] because he you're the only bible some
[50:06] people see
[50:08] i mean you work in the barbershop right
[50:10] all kinds of people come through
[50:12] you're the only bible they're going to
[50:13] read a lot of them and so that's
[50:15] everything everywhere we go we're the
[50:18] only bible
[50:19] you know uh i think i told you on this
[50:21] year before
[50:22] that um francis of assists which the
[50:25] catholic church says is one of theirs
[50:26] but he was a gospel preacher
[50:29] he said preach always that's during all
[50:32] your waking moments you know
[50:35] preach always use words when necessary
[50:39] how does that work well just the way you
[50:41] act
[50:43] the way we acted at the restaurant this
[50:44] morning where just the way you live
[50:47] should preach the gospel but see we're
[50:50] all so smart and we got a cell phone
[50:52] blah blah blah blah blah just zip it
[50:56] let your life live the gospel
[51:01] how does anointing move through music
[51:05] well if you know anything about music
[51:08] it should be obvious now we have a
[51:11] little book on music
[51:13] now the library seems to be in disarray
[51:15] downstairs
[51:16] but if you need a book on music the
[51:19] pastor's wife has one she might let you
[51:21] use for a couple days where rebecca did
[51:24] a
[51:25] very extensive uh research on music
[51:29] in 1991 and we've since put it in a
[51:33] little booklet by itself
[51:34] but it's through the beat you know it's
[51:37] a and then
[51:38] you know you have a piano that's great a
[51:40] couple of guitars
[51:41] we don't we don't need a set of drums
[51:44] because
[51:44] there's only one in a million drummers
[51:46] that know how to play it nicely
[51:48] you know um which happens to be the next
[51:51] question
[51:52] what was brother rem's opinion on drums
[51:55] well pretty much zero
[51:57] never had him don't need them you know
[52:00] was adam created with his theophany in
[52:03] him
[52:05] did something happen to it when he had
[52:06] to leave eden did jesus receive his
[52:09] theophany when he received the holy
[52:10] spirit
[52:11] do we well that's one of those questions
[52:13] that
[52:14] we'll see about later because it's very
[52:16] involved and i don't know
[52:19] quote and the lord god said unto the
[52:21] serpent because you have done this thou
[52:23] hast
[52:23] are cursed above all cattle above every
[52:25] beast of the field upon thy belly shalt
[52:27] thou go
[52:28] and does shalt thou eat all the days of
[52:29] thy life genesis 3 14.
[52:32] so the question how is it that the
[52:35] cattle and the beasts of the field were
[52:36] cursed
[52:37] it doesn't say that it just says
[52:41] you because what you did you're going to
[52:43] be
[52:44] worse than everything okay so it doesn't
[52:47] say that they're cursed
[52:49] okay the wedding at cana in john
[52:53] two one through five okay let's look at
[52:56] that for a minute
[52:57] it's one of my favorite stories here in
[53:00] john chapter 2 verse 1 through 5
[53:04] this story was only written in the book
[53:05] of john okay
[53:07] because the four writers were standing
[53:10] in different positions looking at this
[53:12] story
[53:12] looking at jesus life and ministry and
[53:14] they wrote a little differently
[53:16] um it was only written the book of john
[53:20] who types the bride okay thank you for
[53:22] getting into types here
[53:24] it seems like jesus answers her
[53:27] his mother directly and yet look at how
[53:30] she goes right along and tells the
[53:32] servants
[53:33] uh to do you know whatever he says okay
[53:36] so we don't need to get into meanings
[53:37] and what it might have been and what it
[53:39] could have been
[53:40] um but um
[53:44] let's look at chapter where we're at
[53:45] chapter 2 1-12
[53:49] in the third day there was a marriage in
[53:51] canaan of galilee
[53:52] okay have you ever thought of why it was
[53:55] the third day
[53:57] that is the favorite day for people to
[54:00] get married
[54:01] the third day which is tuesday sunday
[54:04] monday tuesday
[54:07] and they got married on the third day
[54:09] because back in the book of genesis
[54:11] when um you know you know the creation
[54:15] on the first day that's good second day
[54:18] that's good
[54:19] on the third day it's good twice so they
[54:22] chose tuesday's
[54:24] favorite day to get married yeah
[54:27] it's all got a meaning okay so they're
[54:29] having this wedding
[54:30] and the mother of jesus was there and
[54:33] both
[54:34] jesus was called and his disciples to
[54:36] the marriage so they're all invited
[54:38] and when they when they wanted wine the
[54:41] mother of jesus said unto them
[54:42] oh they have no wine and jesus said unto
[54:45] her woman
[54:46] what have i to do with thee mine hours
[54:48] not come in others we don't have a lot
[54:49] of communication right here on this
[54:51] his mother said unto him his mother said
[54:54] unto the servants
[54:55] whatever he says you do it and there was
[54:58] six big water
[54:58] jugs okay these are big big jugs of
[55:01] water
[55:02] uh stone pots and um uh
[55:06] had to do with the purifying and so
[55:07] forth okay
[55:09] so uh containing two or three firth kins
[55:12] apiece
[55:13] that's 150 quarts
[55:17] now those could be you know you can
[55:19] figure it out for yourself but
[55:21] they're big big deals jesus said to them
[55:24] fill the water problems with water okay
[55:26] we'll do that and they filled them to
[55:27] the brim
[55:29] and he didn't pray over it he just said
[55:32] now take out some
[55:33] and give it to the governor the main guy
[55:34] at the feast
[55:36] and they did when the ruler of the feast
[55:39] had
[55:39] tasted the water that was made wine
[55:43] and knew not whence it was or where it
[55:45] came from
[55:48] but the servants drew the water they
[55:50] knew
[55:51] then the governor of the feast called
[55:52] the bridegroom and he said hey
[55:55] every man at the beginning of the of the
[55:57] wedding brings forth the good wine
[55:59] and then when you know they're well
[56:01] drunk then he gives out the cheap stuff
[56:04] but you waited until now to give out the
[56:06] good stuff
[56:07] this was the beginning of miracles jesus
[56:10] did it cain regality
[56:12] and manifested both his glory and his
[56:15] disciples
[56:16] believed on him so
[56:21] the whole thing was the turning of the
[56:22] water into wine okay
[56:25] now there's no need to get in here and
[56:26] try to make more of it than it is
[56:29] just read the story and believe it
[56:32] okay so john represents the bride and
[56:34] all these oh fine
[56:35] but we do have the privilege of
[56:39] you know bringing out things from
[56:41] between the lines
[56:42] it's got to be in harmony with what's on
[56:44] the line it can be something you know
[56:46] way out
[56:47] no it's got to be in line with what's
[56:48] there now
[56:50] in um in context of this
[56:55] one time brother branham was serving
[56:56] communion at the tabernacle
[56:58] in jeffersonville and one of the members
[57:01] had a neighbor that was church christ so
[57:04] he was always telling hey you need to
[57:05] come come church with me
[57:07] well so finally one evening the church
[57:09] of christ man said okay i'll go with you
[57:11] tonight
[57:11] well it happened to be communion night
[57:13] okay and at the tabernacle they've
[57:16] always taken the first sunday night of
[57:17] each month okay
[57:20] and so there's closed communion which is
[57:23] just us
[57:24] and then there's open communion which is
[57:26] whoever if they're a believer
[57:28] so they you know say you're a believer
[57:31] so they
[57:32] line up here and so their neighbor and
[57:35] the church christ
[57:36] man which his name was uh
[57:40] i don't know what his name was the
[57:41] believer was named mr hill of the hill
[57:43] so anyway they're standing there and
[57:46] they
[57:46] saw brother neville say to brother
[57:48] branham we're out of wine what should we
[57:51] do
[57:52] brother men didn't get nervous and you
[57:54] know go to the store and buy something
[57:56] he said we'll just pray so he's holding
[57:59] the tray
[58:00] and the new guy he keeps one eye open
[58:02] you know
[58:04] something going on here well the
[58:06] scripture says watch and pray
[58:08] you know so
[58:13] i mean i want to be legal
[58:16] so he um so he watches as brother
[58:19] branham prays simple prayer
[58:21] and he said the little cups filled with
[58:22] wine from nothing
[58:24] over here it was from the water you know
[58:27] but over here with brother bran it was
[58:28] from nothing
[58:29] so he didn't go back to church christ he
[58:32] okay this is for me i'm gonna stay but
[58:36] um no when you read these things in the
[58:38] scripture and like tomorrow lord willing
[58:40] we'll
[58:40] we'll continue with our study in the
[58:43] book of acts of course we could start
[58:44] chapter one because most of we forgot
[58:45] where we were anyway
[58:47] but uh uh we're just
[58:50] you know bringing out the flavor of
[58:52] what's here
[58:54] we don't have to go and imagine and try
[58:56] to mash things together
[58:58] well it's not important god will reveal
[59:01] what you need when you need it okay
[59:04] so that is the extent no no more
[59:07] that's all we have for tonight and um
[59:11] if you aren't happy with the answers
[59:13] well
[59:15] i was here two and a half years ago so
[59:18] uh he might finish the house in the next
[59:20] couple years i'll come back
[59:21] but in the meantime hey brother
[59:25] paul's you know he can straighten out
[59:27] these things anytime he wants
[59:29] uh we're just trying to give you the
[59:30] best of our understanding
[59:32] and from the scripture and be sure and
[59:34] get yourself
[59:36] one of the new churches books it's
[59:37] readable and um
[59:39] lord willing will be here tomorrow so
[59:42] brother paul do you have some things you
[59:43] want to add
[59:52] it's always a privilege to come by here
[59:58] you know it's always interesting as we
[1:00:00] look into
[1:00:01] the things of scripture we look into the
[1:00:04] message
[1:00:06] uh as we we look at that there is always
[1:00:09] something that will will
[1:00:12] you might say reach out to us something
[1:00:14] that catches our attention
[1:00:17] and i think about how brother branham
[1:00:20] kind of presented that to us and
[1:00:22] you know these things that we would say
[1:00:25] questions
[1:00:26] sometimes if i could say this in the
[1:00:28] correct fashion
[1:00:30] we would be speaking in a sense of more
[1:00:32] of a curiosity
[1:00:34] because these things do not pertain to
[1:00:36] salvation
[1:00:37] it's not as though having an answer to
[1:00:40] that determines whether or not you're
[1:00:42] going to make the rapture
[1:00:43] and but yet we as humans and some being
[1:00:46] you might say more curious
[1:00:48] than others we tend to you know look at
[1:00:51] something
[1:00:52] and the more we look at it
[1:00:56] the the more we feel like we have to
[1:00:58] have an answer
[1:00:59] but the prophet of god said you know if
[1:01:01] you have a question
[1:01:03] and and you don't have an answer for it
[1:01:05] uh he didn't say
[1:01:06] go obsess over this he didn't say you
[1:01:10] know
[1:01:10] uh throw everything else on on the back
[1:01:13] burner until
[1:01:14] this is answered the prophet of god
[1:01:16] actually taught us to put that up on the
[1:01:18] shelf
[1:01:19] and just ask the lord lord in your time
[1:01:21] if you desire
[1:01:23] open this to me and i can speak on my
[1:01:26] own behalf that many times when we have
[1:01:28] placed things
[1:01:29] on the shelf uh there was a little
[1:01:32] something and i won't go into it
[1:01:34] but there was a little something that uh
[1:01:37] you know was a little sharp question
[1:01:39] mark i i kept wondering lord why would
[1:01:42] this be
[1:01:42] like it is uh brothers uh
[1:01:45] sisters it had to have been a half a
[1:01:48] five to six years
[1:01:50] and i'm sitting in a service uh some
[1:01:52] meetings that we had went to and i'm
[1:01:54] i'm hearing the guest minister preaching
[1:01:58] and he basically is like i don't even
[1:02:00] know why i'm addressing this
[1:02:03] and then he proceeded to answer my five
[1:02:05] or six year old question
[1:02:08] and when he did and i look back in the
[1:02:10] scripture
[1:02:11] perfect sense it just come together so
[1:02:15] we we just trust you know as it is no
[1:02:17] man has
[1:02:18] the answers to the things of god when
[1:02:20] brother branham come and
[1:02:22] he opened the word to us my brothers and
[1:02:25] sisters that was
[1:02:26] a supernatural god knowing that you
[1:02:29] in a time in a season in a certain place
[1:02:32] of your life circumstance would need an
[1:02:34] answer and and it was all stored up
[1:02:37] in the word of god but it's stored up in
[1:02:40] such a way the prophet also says
[1:02:42] that it's hidden what is clearly before
[1:02:46] you is
[1:02:46] actually hidden so the the fact that we
[1:02:49] can look in the word of god
[1:02:51] and see these deeper things of the word
[1:02:56] uh and recognize them is a gift a
[1:02:58] blessing from god and
[1:03:00] so i say that to encourage you that if
[1:03:03] you have a question
[1:03:04] you don't have an answer for it just
[1:03:07] hold that up before the lord and say
[1:03:09] lord if
[1:03:09] thy will be done if it's a a matter of
[1:03:12] salvation you can be
[1:03:13] assured that god is going to answer that
[1:03:17] but if it's a matter of how does this
[1:03:19] type fit to this
[1:03:21] type you might have an answer for that
[1:03:25] or you might go your whole life
[1:03:27] but if it's not a matter of salvation
[1:03:30] then it's really not something to obsess
[1:03:32] over
[1:03:33] but we just trust the lord as this
[1:03:36] scripture says
[1:03:37] we trust and obey amen and so we have to
[1:03:41] just come and
[1:03:42] and try not to make too much i think
[1:03:45] sometimes as ministers
[1:03:47] we we can um sometimes
[1:03:50] maybe type things that
[1:03:53] because we're believers we have a
[1:03:55] background we can say okay that
[1:03:57] that kind of goes together but sometimes
[1:04:00] i wonder if
[1:04:01] we're not just creating our own type and
[1:04:04] we want to be careful about that right
[1:04:06] that we we don't get outside of the
[1:04:08] boundaries of the word of god or the
[1:04:10] message of the hour
[1:04:11] we stick with what you might say is the
[1:04:13] known gospel
[1:04:15] which as brother jason would come and
[1:04:17] lead us in a few songs
[1:04:19] the boundaries of the known gospel
[1:04:21] saints not talking about
[1:04:22] stomping revelation but the boundaries
[1:04:25] of the known gospel
[1:04:26] is sufficient to get you and i in a
[1:04:28] rapture
[1:04:30] we don't have to go wandering out in the
[1:04:32] north 40 we don't have to go climb off
[1:04:34] in some canyon somewhere to discover
[1:04:37] something great within the message that
[1:04:39] will shock us all into some reality
[1:04:42] it's right here god's promised it he
[1:04:44] gave it to us
[1:04:45] and it is fulfilling
[1:04:49] in our day it is coming to pass right
[1:04:52] before our eyes
[1:04:53] and oftentimes we struggle to recognize
[1:04:56] it's coming to pass because you
[1:04:57] yourself are fulfilling the prophecy
[1:05:01] and sometimes it's hard to see ourself
[1:05:04] in the prophecy as it is unfolding
[1:05:07] but as this word is promised that in
[1:05:09] this hour it would produce a bride
[1:05:12] you see you are fulfilling
[1:05:15] the prophecy for this hour day by day
[1:05:19] i always have misquoted that quote of
[1:05:22] saint what was his name
[1:05:25] francis of assists but my brother and
[1:05:28] sister i
[1:05:29] firmly believe that amen
[1:05:32] let us live our life let it be a
[1:05:34] testimony
[1:05:36] in conversation with brother george he
[1:05:38] made a reference
[1:05:40] i i don't know if he was actually at the
[1:05:42] store at the moment i was talking to him
[1:05:44] or something but he says these roses
[1:05:46] they're selling outside of this store
[1:05:49] they don't have to do anything but be a
[1:05:52] rose
[1:05:54] they will bloom because they were
[1:05:57] meant to the life is in them no one has
[1:06:01] to tell them
[1:06:01] rose you bloom
[1:06:05] it's in them saints let's let this
[1:06:08] gospel life that's been placed inside of
[1:06:10] us
[1:06:11] come forth and bloom because it is
[1:06:15] already in us we don't have to go
[1:06:18] find it we just have to yield to the
[1:06:21] holy ghost
[1:06:22] let the leadership of the lord lead us
[1:06:25] into the deeper promises of god
[1:06:28] what it will take to get you and i in
[1:06:29] the rapture my brother and sister we've
[1:06:31] quoted this
[1:06:32] many times the prophet of god said it's
[1:06:34] already in you
[1:06:36] isn't that wonderful we can just let go
[1:06:38] and let god
[1:06:39] have his wonderful way brother jason
[1:06:41] would you lead us in a song or two
[1:06:47] oh i got it
[1:06:52] why don't we stand
[1:06:53] [Music]
[1:06:56] i always forget that brother george is
[1:06:58] short and sweet
[1:07:00] [Laughter]
