bless you Sister uh they said that you're traveling come through we're happy to have you and sir we're happy to see you once again here with us Amen to each and every one of you God bless you amen I was just for whatever reason you never really know but I just woke up this morning and uh was thinking about uh sister Nina and uh you know she has dwelt with us here and she's now home and we just pray the Lord just be with her bless her guide her and uh the opportunity arises bring her back to fellowship with us once again and uh you know I hope you don't mind I just getting a little more blunt I guess as life goes uh today you know we're seeing our brother Bob come to the end of this natural life but you know as we singing the song it struck me you know the sky not the grave that's exactly and he could still be here and still be alive and take that trip amen but one thing we do know having known brother Bob for so many years uh he is ready amen he wants to just go on and the reward Lord that he has lived uh his I I think we can just say his whole life amen hallelujah and he's looking forward to that certainly we want to remember uh uh sister ulia this morning uh we just pray that um Lord would just grant to her an easy birth a healthy baby amen and uh uh we just we just really look forward to that amen amen so many things we would like to say but we have so little time I would like to speak to you this morning I uh sitting in a harvester for a lot of hours God bless you thank you sister via and or I don't know I always get it wrong violin they're not fiddles uh violins I know same thing but it's a spirit behind it and uh so uh uh anyway um just appreciate this and um you know just uh as I sat in the Harvester this last week uh I listened to the message uh leadership over and over again and I I already shared this with you but you know when I was searching through to find a message to listen to I I struck it because it was my birthday you know and what a reason to pick a pick a message but there was my birthday and I I just listened to it and I I started listening to it and I realized you know I didn't catch all of it so I went back and listened through it again and then you realize I didn't catch all of it you go back and listen through it you experience that amen where there's like a continual Loop of God speaking to you and uh so you know it uh it just just struck our heart today amen definitely we want to uh remember I know our brother darl Ward uh has shared a little of the testimony uh of going out amongst the people that in the hills of Tennessee and uh literally um they took a four-wheeler to carry resources uh people have no gasoline and if the roads were even fit to drive they have no gasoline for their cars because the storm disrupted everything and brother Daryl shared how that when you would show up with cases of water and some food humanity is the same I don't care if they're saved or not and grown-ups adults burst into tears because they feel forsaken amen now we understand brother brand brother brand taught us very clearly that there's always warning before judgment and America certainly of all Nations on Earth has had the warning that's exactly right and judgment will come that's exactly the Bible says so amen amen I want to speak to you on leadership this morning let's turn our Bibles to the Book of Genesis the 22nd chapter and uh sometimes God's leadership doesn't look like leadership in this case we'll see as we look into this actually it looks like a trial it looks like a struggle it looks like uh hard times it it doesn't uh speak to us in a sense that we would just say oh okay this is God's leadership I'll just step into this uh so as we start in verse one amen and it came to pass after these things that God did tempt Abraham my this wasn't just a hey I want to make a point to you it was a Temptation that's right said unto him Abraham and he said behold here I am and he said take now thy son thine only son Isaac whom thou lovest and get thee into the land of Mariah and offer him there for a burnt offering upon one of the mountains which I will tell thee of boy that should have popped a r flag right there right you what the promised son you want me to go kill him but look at this Abraham rose up early in the morning saddled his ass and took two of his young men with him and Isaac his son and clave the wood for the burnt offering and Rose up and went into the place of which God had told him then on the third day Abraham lifted up his eyes and saw the place a far off and he said unto his young men abide ye here with the ass and I and the lad will go Yonder and worship and come again to you Abraham took the word of the burnt offering and laid it upon Isaac his son and he took the fire in his hand and a knife and they went both of them together and Isaac spake unto Abraham his father and said my father and he said here am I my son and he said behold the fire and the wood but where is the Lamb for a burnt offering Abraham said my son God will provide Bo I tell you it just struck me this morning it came right out right here before us God will provide amen amen I thought that was a very special thing the Lord just allowed to come in that vein amen God will provide himself a lamb for a burnt offering so they went both of them together and they came to the place which God had told him of and Abraham built an altar and laid the wood in order and bound Isaac his son and laid him on the altar upon the wood and Abraham stretched forth his hand and took the knife to slay his son and the angel of the Lord called unto him out of heaven and said Abraham Abraham and he said here am I and he said lay not thine hand upon the lad neither do thou anything unto him for now I know that thou fearest God seeing thou Hast not withheld thy son thine only son from me and Abraham lifted up his eyes and looked and behold behind him a ram caught in a Thicket by his horns and Abraham went and took the RAM and offered him up for a burnt offering in the stead of his son and Abraham called the name of that place Jehovah Gyra as it is said to this day in the Mount of the Lord it shall be seen Heavenly Father we come today just asking father guide our words our thoughts Lord there's so many Avenues so many things father to speak on but help us Lord to be focused today Lord in this time father as a gathering together of saints there's many needs in the body father many needs amongst the families Lord many families not here today but Lord we would ask you to focus us on the word father not on those things around us the peripheral oh Lord let us be faithful to lift one another up in prayer to be standing there Lord as the phrase is I've got your back Lord let us have the back of our brother sister father to raise them in prayer Lord not in criticisms and not in negative things Lord but uplifting prayer because Prayer Changes Things We ask you to bless this service today in the name of Jesus Christ amen am you may be seated as we would look at this today I just want to say thank you for those that were lifting us up in prayer as we were out of town harvesting um you know sometimes the trials seem so big the minute you pass through the trial you look and you realize that it really was not as great as we thought it was as we look at this scripture we see a very much of an emphasis here that God will provide everything my brother and sister that we as Christians uh have going on in our life we have to really stop and just look take a moment and look not to get so busy we don't stop and Ponder to realize what God has done for us and what he's doing every single day now we can focus on the natural and look at that and say you know what the Lord's done this this and this but let's not uh get caught up in the natural let's look at what God has done in our own lives how that he has brought us and he he's comforted us and given us strength and protected us and been our provision and every portion of that is a part of this experience and you know Satan would love for us to uh get so caught up in the Troubles of the day that we would not recognize the blessing of the day and uh if we're only thinking of the negative things then we will miss the very uh Beauty beauty that is right before us the beauty of the open word the beauty of reading our Bible and seeing something that we have not seen before something that that was there all the time but now it suddenly fits in place and and and we have to say thank you Lord for that because it is when that word is open to us my brother and sister when we see Revelation in the word it it is building us up God gives it to us to strengthen us and to encourage us and sometimes it corrects us and and we should say thank you Lord for the correction also amen it's not all just about God blessing us but it should be that we should rejoice in the correction of the word and when we uh can get into the word to receive whatever God speaks to us my brother and sister we're coming to the experience that Abraham had amen so as we look at this leadership is uh by short definition headship and guidance amen now we can look at leadership in a term of dictation to to say you will do this and you will do that or you don't do this or you don't do that but my brother and sister as we look through the word we'll realize headship is Christ leading us amen he is there giving us guidance he didn't just write it out some people would disagree with this but he didn't just write it out in a journal and then abandon you to try and find the way way to go but there's the Holy Spirit he said I'll send the comforter to you and when the comforter is with you there is the word in written form but the comforter is giving you insight into what you are reading and it starts to speak to the heart my brother and sister you know it's not just that we would look and want uh to have Revelation but my brother and sister Revelation is something that comes personal to you is there Collective Revelation yes but I would dare to say here today that there are many of us have slightly points not PS that matter for salvation but different points of view on different things of the scripture and God would reveal that to you because he personalized the word to you so we're not talking about doctrinal difference we're just talking about what it means to you amen now it's maybe a little harder we have young people born in the church raised up in the church Godly families they do not fully understand or comprehend the effect of sin in one's life amen they do not comprehend that and when the word being preached would talk about being forgiven from sins there will be those that their mind if they went back into time would look at things that they would not even want to speak in public amen and a young person filled with the Holy Ghost raised in the church amen their idea of sin would be that yes I I did this was tempted to tell a little lie and tempted to do this and yet yet we know of Brothers in different types and places that have um done Grievious crimes and God still saved them that's right you see my brother and sister it's not an exclusive message on the basis of who we are but it's an exclusive message on the basis of who he is amen so we say thank you because sometimes we get caught up in our little microcosm Our Little World there and we kind of tend to look at things and let's just look at Abraham's Journey just real briefly this morning we see Abraham how God starts to deal with him and you know they were Idol worshippers and and by transition we'll see that he takes a step and God deals with him and he takes another step and he separates himself from his family and you imagine you know I'm just going to embellish maybe a little bit but your family is just making millions off of producing idols and and you know the money and the ease of life and all of those good things and God comes one and says separate yourself my brother and sister God is not a respector of person rich or poor when he asks you to separate yourself amen there will be just like Abraham a time that you're coming to a great test amen a great temptation is there to like the Rich Young Ruler to justify well I give to the church and I support this and the orphanage and this and this and this but that isn't what God asked him to do God didn't say up your support for this or that God says sell all thy house give to the poor and follow me what was he looking for same thing with Abraham will you do what I ask you to do or will you reason it and you have I'll give more I'll double my tithe I'll double my offerings I'll do no God didn't ask him to do that amen so here it is we see Abraham's journey and you know the one thing that seemed to make so much sense I mean it's just very practical is that you know I have a nephew and you know he he's seeing you know he's seeing the message of the hour I'm going to take him along with me with him and and I'm going to encourage him but that isn't what God said he didn't say take your nephew he said you know separate yourself and you yourself go and you notice God never really blessed him that's right until he got to the point he did the word that's right God didn't suggest see the problem we have is too many people take the word of God the message of the hour the preaching of the word as suggestions God's not in the suggesting business my brother and sister amen so you look at this Abraham's Journey brings him to all the things you know he goes over denies his very marriage to his wife amen all of these little things that transition in his life and it's all part of a journey it's all part of God moving along I think it's wonderful my brother and sister when you see people that that uh God just saves them like right now and their life just 180 and everything changes and they're just pressing forward in the mark but I'll tell you because I can testify of my own life sometimes God just leads his poor children along amen he doesn't lead us out into the Wilderness but he's leading Us by our own resistance to full obedience the journey in the Wilderness my brother and sister was not God's idea it was man's idea because they were resistant to a full surrender to the word of God they compromised it and said but if and God said but if you won't receive and Obey I'll let you go until you want to imagine I know this sounds harsh forgive me imagine you get to see your grandparents who up to a certain point are are just so strong and healthy but denied the word yeah couldn't hear the voice that's right and it didn't in there though it'd be your lovely parents and they fall in the wilderness also and something starts to permeate their thinking and they start to realize God's serious about this do we believe God's serious about this amen it's Humanity that plays the game it's Humanity that explains it away it's Humanity that holds back I just read recently down Arizona there's a certain Trail a little more for dieh hard hikers than for for beginners and literally there's a spot in that trail where the trail comes to a ledge and the next step is out there say here to the Pew there's a little sign been posted there and says don't go beyond this unless you're committed right the guy writing this says you know I looked at that and I had to ask myself am I committed and when he looked out and everybody he was hiking with they come to that point and they said we're committed they got back and they took a run and they leaped over that and continued on the trail and he said they got out there a few feet and they said are you coming and he said 'I haven't decided yet and one of his own friends says why not what do you got to lose he walks up I got quite a bit to lose but the point being if you're committed and you put the effort into it it wasn't that hard to jump across the chasm commitment will get us across the chasm amen it won't be my brother and sister that we are fully committed and God brought us here to fail that's what Israel thought you brought us to the wilderness they told Moses you brought us to the Wilderness to let us die here but God never answered direct cuz he'd already spoken his word he didn't come and explain it to each one of them with a little pamphlet about how that this is how and this is how and no no he already had told them and they would not make a full commitment and they died in the wilderness blaming God and Moses amen that's right when the real test or trial was themselves that's right refusing to be fully committed that's right and so as we see this transition in Abraham's life he faces trial after trial God comes on the scene Time After Time Can someone say Amen to that amen that we see God coming amen uh time after time and we see this transition taking that place and look how patient God is stands before a king and says this is my sister technically could be a b basis of truth but the reality was it was his wife so he knew he was denying his own marriage vow that's right by disowning her H my but God still patiently moved him along so much that he speaks to a King a man whose word changes lives and kingdoms and whatever and says if you don't go apologize you're as good as a dead man what it looks like in human reasoning that should have been turned around and it should have been God chastising Abraham amen for Abraham to go apologize to the king I misled you but God so favored Abraham and teaching him the lesson that he says you know what king you apologize you are the one who is going to die in this equation and so what what was gaining Abraham's faith in God was gaining amen his courage was gaining amen maturity amen there won't be an immature Christian make it to Heaven that's exactly amen not half R God's not picking green apples amen you know there's something that God is going to do in your life in my life and that is he's going to put you through every trial every struggle there is until you decide I want to be a mature Christian Lord let me face the trial let me face the times in my life when I want to give up when I don't have unction enough to go forward Lord I want you to come and urge me forward but you realize sometimes the urging is not so peaceful it's not so calm God uses dire circumstances sometimes to move us along exactly amen so what's he doing he's bringing maturity by experience amen I say that fits perfectly to the day that we live in as Christians we are being brought into maturity as Christians by experience we're not in Flowery beds of ease God never said I promise you flowery beds of ease amen but he did promise US my brother and sister that when we get to that divide he'll be there for us that's one thing he promised amen and so what's happened you know when this thought come to me the other day of being seasoned the I I hope you have a sense of humor this morning sister Jerry had I don't remember what it was she might not remember either but she'd fixed something and she started to put a pinch in and put slightly bigger pinch and I'm eating supper and I'm like this stuff is spicy now you got to understand most of you would eat it you would eat it and say what's wrong with this it's because I'm a but you look at that and it struck me you know what we're being seasoned that's right amen through the trials and struggle of life God is seasoning us and we can press on and we can uh say that we're going to accomplish on our own but yet that seed Gene that God placed in US says you know what I don't have to do this alone I can trust the Lord to take the difference amen and give me the strength I need to press the battle to rise to the high calling in Christ Jesus amen this is what we come to the place I can do that I can be faithful in church I can have perfect attendance I can read my Bible I can do all of these things but after a while we'll find that there is something greater and God says just trust me amen just trust me go ahead step out out just like the little sign right there don't go beyond this point if you're not committed and that's coming into every Christian's life there's a point that we come to that we either turn back come on Saints we either turn back or we're committed amen amen Lord help me I want to be fully committed amen if I have to run H you know and and and maybe even have a little tinge of fear in my heart which this man in his little story says even as I leaped I thought Lord if I die let it be quick you know my brother and sister but we're not called to die we're not called to die we're called to rise in Christ Jesus amen eternal life no separation there for the bride for a real Christian there's no separation that second death my brother and sister that Eternal separation is not for you amen it's for the one who won't commit Lord help us to be committed amen amen so we become seasoned and we learn by mistakes see this is such a paradox in Christ we learn by our mistakes and we also learn by what we do correctly right so Satan puts a magnifying glass on the mistake absolutely lays a page over those things done correctly right magnify the mistake but God edifies those things that we do correct amen now this would probably sound awkward today if I was standing here preaching this sermon and I was perfect that wouldn't mean I'm only preaching to you yeah that's right but I'm preaching to me amen because well I don't know if I'd have courage enough to tell you all the mistakes I've made in my life amen but I can tell you with firm confidence that what God has done in my life amen is Supernatural it's incredible amen and in credulous something that could be shouted from the rooftop and you know what's happening it seems like now follow me here it seems like I'm making more mistakes than ever but when I stop and I look back I realize in Jesus Christ I've risen to height that I've never been before amen what's happening is is this Narrows down my brother and sister what we used to think was no big deal bothers us now that's right the things that we used to just say oh God understands we're now saying Lord forgive me for that thought forgive me for that deed forgive me for that that's why it seems like you're making more mistakes is because God has taken the blinders off of us and we're now coming what into Perfection amen it's no longer that we're just close is close enough but now we're being brought into the stage the time of perfectionate it' be different for different lives but what we do know is the life is there bringing us into Perfection will we be perfect In the Flesh no sorry this flesh will bother you as long as you're on this Earth this flesh will bother you amen anybody want to be seasoned you I want to be seasoned absolutely amen I want the word to come and touch me in every aspect of my life amen I don't want one portion for God to say oh I'll let that slide I want to be seasoned to stand and know who I am what I am in Jesus Christ amen so we look at that he's there he he's being seasoned he's being corrected his mistakes are being pointed out to him I'd say it look pretty familiar to us right each one of us are coming to a place we're starting to recognize God is doing something Supernatural it's not just oh I believe the message for this long it's not just that we've been in this church for so long or I've held this certain office for a period of time but it's a personal relationship which is irrelevant of office amen amen absolutely irrelevant of office exactly right you see God didn't just let brother brandham just go on with his mistakes he made him correct them and one thing I always Marvel about is the fact he wasn't bashful about telling you and I that he made the mistake and how God dealt with him amen now what that do make us look down on that oh I'm sorry maybe we're cut out of a Different Cloth but I look up at that and say my he could have no one on Earth would have known that but he himself and in the one case his wife no one would know that he could just put it under the covers and that would just go away but what does he do he exposes it he puts it right out there in the open and you know why he did cuz God was thinking of me amen and you that's right amen that we would recognize we are and God's got Grace right there for every mistake that's right amen this is real leadership that's right amen not dictation my brother and sister this is leadership God coming back wherever we veered off the trail he doesn't yell back at us turn right he comes back and takes us through that hard time that Rocky place now look at this I need to move along Abraham had come to these places in his life we all know the story under such headship but right in the season that he comes under such headship it's not far back on the page when you realize he's still making mistakes amen right let's separate the flesh man that's right from the spiritual man right let's quit letting the flesh man lead us that's right amen the flesh man's only God leadership of a flesh or carnal world that's right but the spiritual man's got the leadership of Jesus Christ amen amen who learned obedience by the things he suffered that's right so he didn't just say just do what I say he said do what I did amen are you with me amen so he could come back and say I was tempted of every Temptation and we stand here and say well that's good he was Jesus Christ he could say but my brother and sister his flesh would tell you I suffered in that occasion I suffered in that time or season of my life amen it's not just words cuz you see in the right position we can write words that would impossible for our fellow man to follow right easy to write those and expect someone else to live what maybe we ourselves struggle I love military history miss our sister Sue today she's given me a whole Library full of military history many wars my brother and sister needlessly people suffered because someone far away was able to pin words that could not be fulfilled but our lord Jesus the words were pinned amen and he pinned them or had them pinned from his own experience and he overcame every Temptation every trial every devil every circumstance but it even according to scripture brought obedience in him amen through those trials what was it there's a lot of ways to diagram or describe that obedience by brother and sister but you could put it in a simple term he learned obedience in other words he knew for a fact it was possible for you filled with the Holy Ghost to overcome that trial absolutely he wasn't giving that to the caral man he was talking to Sons and Daughters of God and he could then pin or have that word pinned in such a fashion you can do this sir because I've done it and if I am in you and you are in me and we are one the word amen it's possible that's it that's word let's not get into the the carnal man realm intellectual where by intellectual words we say if you're a Christian you can this if you're a Christian you can that if you're a Christian you should this if you're a Christian you should that my brother and sister this is a battle of flesh and blood but we also have the spirit of Christ the Holy Ghost in us to lead us through the trial Amen to bring us to the place we should cuz if we're looking for perfection in the flesh Abraham's out that's it wait Moses is out that's right oh my David's definitely gone that's right the apostles done right see it's something more that's it amen it's a life that's on the inside that's bringing the outside into subjection Hallelujah right exactly amen but look at this let me move on Abraham had come under such headship when God spoke to him he didn't even argue didn't even ask for an exilation now I'm telling you my brother and sister that's incredible because God speaks to you and says take your son on the mountain and kill him whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa Lord this is a promised son and uh there's been a mistake that's for the neighbor but Abraham had come under such subjection to the headship or the leadership of the holy spirit that God speaks to him says take your son offer him as a sacrifice now my brother and sister it's obvious I say this in a little bit in humor but truth it's obvious he didn't explain this to his wife because by morning that son would have been hidden so well he could never find him that's right see sometimes God just deals in his own way that's and he knew amen but look this turns prophetic do do you realize this turns prophetic it's no longer an angel of God it's no longer God himself speaking to Abraham but they come in the journey to the mountain and they're standing there at the mountain and he's telling the two young Lads you guys wait here simple hidden words of Prophecy the lad and I are going to go to the mountain and worship and we will return here amen knowing the whole time God's expecting him to kill his son but Abraham maybe not even realizing it maybe he just thought it was words but he says we will return amen oh my brother and sister do you realize I'm not trying to get way off on a limb here if you could really go back in your own life and realize the words that God has anointed you to speak and you didn't even realize that they were prophecy right we're just we're just conversation we think amen so what's what's Abraham do he collects all the resources young men the wood a knife and he heads to the mountain no explanation to the why for anyone around him but you know along the journey Isaac had been raised right amen he knew it's not just knowledge head knowledge my brother and sisters one thing that serves us good amen but Isaac knew how the function of of the offering worked he he hadd been well schooled and he's walking along with his dad and he says Hey Dad um we've got wood and we've got fire but where is the offering the sacrifice well now son I have to explain this to you that the Lord spoke to me and um you're dying up on the mountain I thought that TR through you that people be be as great as the Sands of the seashore but maybe that was a misinterpretation of what was spoken maybe we missed an understanding no my brother and sister Abraham had a personal experience and that personal experience was so personal when God had told him that your son through your son will be a people as great as the Sands of the seashore Abraham believed him come on Saints it's about time for us to trust God Amen what he says he will do we don't need the devil to explain it away where we're afraid to run and jump over the chasm amen you could be there and say you know what uh maybe somebody's fallen and got hurt and I'm not going to add my name to their list I'm turning back my brother and sister it is not so amen when we believe the word amen if you're committed you can do it amen if you're not committed maybe it's time to turn back it might sound like I'm encouraging people to quit serving God well my brother and sister if you're going to serve him half-heartedly amen you maybe ought to just quit for a while and when you get tired of being miserable and unhappy maybe you can come back because we serve a patient God he'll come back and say you ready for the rest of the journey now yes Lord I'm ready for the rest the journey cuz I realize the spirit of leoda now look I I'm I'm sorry you know sometimes people don't understand this but a as a farmer to our visitors I rub shoulders with a lot of people who are quite well off and think they're quite important and in that realm right there you hear all kinds of things and very few people would question them because you're talking about you're dealing with carinal here the man with the money and he can say kind of what he wants and people just kind of I don't even bother to nod my head I don't want it to be perceived that I agree with them in any form or fashion amen you know sometimes you have to like flesh you are not going to agree and there's where Satan gets in is because we find ourselves by agreement or lack of resistance and we get ourselves caught up in things we say how did this happen because by action we agreed are you following me so he comes answers his son God will provide Jehovah Gyra amen this is the kind of uh confidence we need in God today it's a s whatever you know it' be I remember a man one time a little story I read that there was a man criticizing what did your God ever do and the man finally had enough of that and he turns back to the guy and says well what did your God ever do for you and he said I ask you first and he said when I was a a drunk and a heathen just like you you know one of our problems is is we always put on the little cotton soft fluffy gloves when we deal with heathens amen I know a brother personally how he come to serve God was a fellow coworker looked at him one day got tired of hearing this guy's criticisms of what he believed in the Bible and whatever and that and he just told him blunt straight up he said you know the day will come you'll beg God to hear the words I'm telling you again because in your present State you're going to hell the man said how dare you say that that's insulting oh telling me my God is a phony my God is a liar my God is that's not insulting you're going to hell if you don't change amen the man the testimony on that the man went home that night now that sounds too harsh we always want to put on the little fluffy gloves to deal with the unbeliever but if they're a real son or daughter of God it'll be God that deals with him not you it's not your words the man laid in bed half of the night and said I'm going to hell cuz something in there struck him truth down in his heart that he knew he was a liar and a fornicator and a this and a that my he knew it and he's there in bed at night and he's like I'm going to hell he was a young man didn't have a family in toop I'm going to hell went back to work the next day and said how are you going to miss hell and he said glad you asked amen amen because God's got a provided way for every individual and here's Abraham amen he's there he's put in a quandry I'm taking my son my only son amen a promised son I'm taking him to the top of the mountain and I'm going to kill him amen now let me tell you brother and sister Jehovah Gyra is not a phrase It's a reality it's a word it's living amen hallelujah amen it's a living promise amen now see you got to understand the context this is stunning when you think about it here's Abraham under an initial word from God Amen Audible Voice commandment he's going up the mountain and as he's going up the mountain he actually has murder in his heart you realize it he's going to fulfill this commandment he's taken his only son up the mountain he's got that now just let me embellish if you don't mind he probably once in a while touched that knife he knew exactly what was going to happen he knew my brother and sister that this son that's walking beside him strong brother Bram says about 12 or so years old and he he walking strong I mean my how proud we can be of a son at 12 years old my own son was driving semis and tractors and loaders and everything at 12 years old and my brother and sister he's there and he's coming I'm going to ful fill the word of God God told me I must slay my son and as he's getting closer to the deal something had settled down in his heart and you can see this was what would it take for a man to draw back a knife and kill his son not in anger but to fulfill a commandment that's right no wonder there are some of these Fanatics out here do things they get so consumed in their thought a Abraham would have been one of them and God saw the resolve that he had at the same time I promise you that Abraham's heart was breaking amen and he has drawn Back the Knife and is starting to plunge that to his son and God speaks to him again and said just a test just a test now I know that's it that you'll serve me that's right now I know that I can trust you I want to know my brother and sister forget about your son will you plunge the knife of the word into your own heart that's it will you follow him enough that you would actually sacrifice your flesh oh don't get offended at me this morning I'm preaching to Paul amen amen I'm preaching to myself my brother and sister because there's times that I'm fully reminded that I am a flesh man that's right amen fully reminded of my shortcomings in Jesus Christ but look at this my brother and sister it was shocking when you think about it fully committed to kill his son but remember the prophecy hidden in such simple words that's right the lad and I will go worship you see he told the whole thing that's exactly he told it all out right there we're going to go to the mountain he had no idea what he was saying that's right we're going to go to the mountain and we're going to worship and we're going to return what what brought him into that place of worship full obedience that's it to the word that's right if he'd had anything left less than full obedience he would have said yeah I'll talk to you in a minute now what was it you had to save to me that's how most of us respond to God Amen Lord right after I've done all these things that I've determined I'm going to do I'll come back and talk to you about what it is you were trying to tell me amen no amen what God wants is that instantaneous amen connection that's it he speaks we respond that's right amen that's right because if we don't respond we just killed our own son y think about it that way now I don't want to put too heavy a burden on you today but I'm telling you my brother and sister there's been many a time that God wanted to speak to us amen we were too busy to listen amen now put that over in the natural after the knife was buried in Isaac to say now Angel of the Lord what did you have to say Amen now maybe there was a little personal understanding in there maybe Abraham thought I'll slay my son there will literally be the blood the life is in the blood I'll slay my son and God will Super naturally come and raise him back up again and he was going up there on that mindset yep that's what God's going to do I'll slay my son I'll have his the blood will be on the altar his blood will be on me and then God will raise him back up because this promise sand sand of the sea Shores has to come to pass but God said no all I want to know is if you'll really do it now some explain it way different ways but my brother and sister if that's hand was already being driven and God speaks he stops God says I know I can trust you you want to know I want to know my brother and sister God can trust me that's right I think every one of us should come to a place or be willing to come to a place in our life that we are so committed to God that we know by revelation God would trust us amen as ministers we have to come there's a lot that preach otherwise but we need to come we have to come to a place that when we handle the word of God we know God trusts us with this word let us hurry on you know it's easy to forget God's promise in the midst of the battle in the midst of tying your son up laying him on the wood that you made him pack up the mountain you have the knife in your hand be pretty simple forget the promise but you see my brother and sister if you don't catch anything else out of today please catch this God's promises you hear people say well God promised and it's not coming to pass I'm not seeing my healing I'm not seeing Deliverance I'm not seeing salvation for children or a spouse I'm not seeing it do you realize a promise of God has to be Revelation to you amen that's right we have Revelations of the godhead and the seals and the church ages and and all of these things we have Revelations but how about you go to a place and approach God that his promise to your life my brother and sister is a revelation not just words on a page anybody can ink words on a page but how come they don't come to pass is because they left them on the page that's right and when they pull them off the page and it becomes Revelation to them amen I amen I I'll be filled with the Holy Ghost because the word says so amen it's not Christ in your head no that's right that's Christ having Liberty in the whole body he wants more than just your head and people say well I gave him my heart well from the abundance amen that same heart you gave away is still got its own opinion yeah follows the word when it's comfortable and doesn't follow it when it isn't comfortable that's right follows the word when it needs to follow it and doesn't follow it when everything's good amen my I didn't realize I had near this much stuff we can cut it off right here this will work fine the Lord testing us will you trust me that's it if there's no other test that you have in your life don't take this as all inclusive but no other test that you've had in your life pass the test that God will trust you amen do whatever it takes that God would look at you and say that is my son that is my daughter and this is what they believe amen got some other things some quotes but I just feel Amen to just stop right there maybe it's because I can make part two but lovely quote thy seed shall possess the Gate of the enemy amen we'll we'll save that for later but look at this my brother and sister God's Got A Plan am he does are we part of the plan or are we just witnesses to the plan I want to be a part of it amen amen I don't want to be the one standing back and saying you know I've seen some people that weren't worth 5 cents and I saw God turn them into Saints and I witnessed how their lives changed and I witnessed what they did and I witnessed this and this and this but how about we have a testimony that I wasn't worth 5 cents amen and God changed me and turned me from a sinner to a saint that's it amen cuz I don't know that they'll be in the Judgment so much the witnesses saying yep they were a real Christian while they themselves are being told depart from me I want to be a true witness amen of the word the true word that is restoring the hearts back amen true word that is staying in the word all the way through their life amen now I'm going to pull a little excerpt out of this uh uh uh th and thy seat shall possess the Gate of the enemy paragraph 137 and I'm just pulling this out and then sister VI if you'll come that'll force me to uh to stop and you say I Heard a Voice tell me this if it's contrary to the word it wasn't God's voice that's right God's voice comes to the word that's right my brother and sister there's where we want to live we want to live at the point that God's voice takes us right back right here this this is what the voice told me to do amen amen amen and last but not least we've heard this story so many times how did that Ram get missed in the first place my brother and sister Our God's a supernatural God Amen while Abraham's working his way through all of that God just creates a ram places him right there in the bush God's provided amen amen Jehovah Gyra is here today amen I want to ask you what's your need that's it have you in all sincerity ask God to provide it it because you see my brother and sister he's in the providing business sir and he will provide everything that we need to fulfill his promise that's right you see God's not going to come down my brother and sister and always place it in your hand right sometimes you have to pursue it that's right you have to step out and say Lord I want to live a holy life I want to live a life that is more of witness of who you are not a witness of success got lots of witnesses you hear people sometimes now this is just a little slight moment of event you hear people sometimes come back who should know better and say well you know we just got this big thing here and I made all this money from it praise God God's blessing me but what about those over here that are living paycheck to [Music] paycheck let's not misinterpret the word Lord change our thinking Amen to fit your word amen amen God bless you today hopefully I I didn't confuse anyone I prayed this morning that my thoughts would not confuse anyone amen so I just pray that it's there let's just stand sing a song or two before we would dismiss this song trust and Obey 529 come to me this morning while I was wrapping up my studies that it really comes down we just got to trust him and I think we should be bold enough to ourself to ask ourselves do I really trust God if God told me to sell all I have that's it could I do it that's it if God told me to take my son to the mountain could I do it that's if God told me to go many years ago over somewhere in the Indochina area I can't remember that this man was a missionary and there was a lepr colony a few miles just a half a dozen miles off the shore of this island and been turned into a lepre colony inhabited by thousand thousand of lepers and they believed that it was an evil spirits the reason these people had leprosy and God spoke to this man who wasn't a doctor he said I want you to move to that island and I want you to go and pray for those people he said his mind first went to the fact they're lepers and it's [Music] contagious but God urged him when he first went to the island the boat wouldn't even touch the shore they made him jump off the boat in chest deep [Music] water and the people there do you realize you coming here is one against the current laws but two you'll end up with Leprosy and he said but God told me to come here imagine come come on folks let's deal with this you can be a Christian and a leper [Music] also and he found a few Christians on the island when he told them God told me to come here and pray for you people there's a few amongst them said we could use the prayers God didn't send him idly there he started holding these meetings and talking about faith in God and praying for people and people who's fingers eaten have you ever seen a leper I've met a leper he was healed modern medicine in his case but it ate all of his fingers off to the joints he had little stubs he was praying for people and they would go to bed with Leprosy and wake up with healthy hands and feet and when one was delivered another had Faith to believe could we be the one that's right Lord let us must be the one that believes let belief be contagious did you know the spirit of Leia makes people lukewarm and cold and God placed you right here in leoda for you to believe and it to be known publicly that's right did did we catch the word publicly that there are believers in the land come on Amen finally the government come and arrested him and took him off the island because they didn't want their leper colony to go away those Appropriations from the government to keep this alive and these people got their appropriation also if there's no lepers there's no funds they wanted the leprosy but you see the thing was there marked as a leper they considered you always a leper and those that had been healed continued doesn't that sound like the Old Testament Church one brother Brown talks about how Billy Graham said I I go there we have all these people saved we come back in a year and there's hardly any but the Old Testament was one would go and come back and there's a body of Believers let us be the one Amen Let us with real leadership live the gospel Hallelujah I wasn't too blunt or anything today are we okay okay when we walk with the Lord in the light of his word what a glory he sheds on our way while we do his good will he abides with us still and with all who will trust and oy oh trust and oy for there's no other way to be happy in Jesus but to trust and oy not a shadow can rise not a cloud in the skies but his smile quickly drives it away there's not a doubt or a fear not a sign and nor a tear can abide while we trust and oy oh trust and oy for there's no other way to be happy in Jesus but to trust and and oy there's not a burden we bear not a sorrow we share but our toil he does richly repay there's not a grief nor a loss not a frown no for a cross but is blessed if we trust and [Music] oy oh trust and oy for there's no other way to be happy in Jesus but to trust and over I'm sorry my voice is just giving up on me Amen brother [Music] ISAC I was just reading on Abraham and that this morning you know God's just God's good amen hallelujah thank we're on
