[33:28] things and i see the cord underneath the
[33:30] music stand and i'm like there's a
[33:32] disaster fixing to happen
[33:35] but it all worked out and i whispered in
[33:37] her ear and i says and that was me
[33:39] preparing tonight's sermon
[33:41] and amen it just seems like i bumped
[33:43] into this and stumbled over that and had
[33:45] to rearrange this and and so just pray
[33:48] for me amen i know in my heart what i'm
[33:51] trying to communicate but i still even
[33:53] now i'm just gonna have to totally rely
[33:56] i mean totally rely on the lord because
[33:58] it's like is this here is that there i
[34:00] started with this here but it's moved
[34:02] down here now and that's over here and
[34:04] praise the lord he's in control
[34:06] hallelujah let's turn john 10 verses 11
[34:10] through 18 and i certainly say to anyone
[34:13] who's not here tonight uh god bless you
[34:17] and uh we just want the power of the
[34:19] holy spirit to move whether it's through
[34:22] the internet

[34:26] unable to maybe uh stream or something
[34:29] we serve an awesome god we serve a god
[34:32] that knows and discerns the intents of
[34:35] our heart
[34:36] and i'll touch on that a little bit if
[34:39] so be the lord wills but my brother and
[34:42] sister we have to realize
[34:45] that this
[34:47] world we live in right now amen is
[34:50] entirely
[34:52] subject that we have a hard time we know
[34:54] who's in control right our god's in
[34:56] control but god actually yielded
[34:59] the control as it were of this earth now
[35:03] of this present kingdom
[35:05] he just gave it over to satan and he let
[35:07] satan just run rampant but and i'm
[35:10] jumping way ahead of my notes but
[35:11] remember now
[35:13] god put
[35:15] catch this
[35:16] god had a hedge around job
[35:20] and god says you know what
[35:22] satan i have so much confidence in this
[35:24] man
[35:26] i'm going to open this hedge
[35:29] and you can do everything
[35:31] but take his life
[35:33] but do you know what god did when he
[35:35] opened the hedge to job
[35:39] he put a hedge around the devil
[35:45] he limited
[35:46] what the devil
[35:48] could do
[35:50] and satan
[35:52] trust me he's smart enough to know
[35:54] that while he has free reign to to tempt
[35:57] and to torment and condemn and do all of
[36:00] these things he is smart enough to know
[36:04] there's a hedge around him
[36:06] and he is limited in what he can do
[36:10] isn't that beautiful i thank the lord
[36:13] for inspiration like that when you
[36:14] realize i i i just jumped about five
[36:17] pages here but i just can't help it my
[36:19] brother and sister to know that god has
[36:22] the same confidence in you that he had
[36:25] in job and that's why he's given the
[36:27] devil liberty
[36:29] to roar like a lion
[36:33] but when the devil gets to that certain
[36:35] point he looks
[36:36] and all he sees
[36:38] is the holy ghost
[36:40] he sees the angels of almighty god
[36:43] round about his people
[36:45] and satan knows my power is limited
[36:50] so that's why he resorts to such
[36:52] trickery
[36:53] because he's got to convince you that
[36:55] he's powerful he's got to convince you
[36:57] that he's in control he's got to
[36:59] convince you
[37:01] that he has dominance over you
[37:04] but praise the lord amen we've got to
[37:06] read the back of the book as they say
[37:08] and we realize that he's defeated he's
[37:10] vanquished and we are as sons and
[37:13] daughters of god according to the word
[37:16] victorious amen and
[37:19] i'm speaking to believers so i know i'm
[37:21] not going to hedge anything tonight
[37:23] we're in control
[37:25] now i don't have to define that and then
[37:26] explain to you no it's really god that's
[37:28] in control saints you know that as a
[37:30] believer we've been granted
[37:32] amen not the power
[37:34] but the authority
[37:36] and so i want to clarify that to you
[37:38] tonight because we're going to be
[37:40] talking about power
[37:42] but this is all in the context of what
[37:44] god has given to us granted to us
[37:47] remember
[37:48] esther
[37:49] even to the half
[37:51] of my kingdom
[37:53] we don't see esther saints if we can
[37:55] look back through time running to the
[37:57] throne every single day should we invite
[38:00] so-and-so over tonight should we do this
[38:03] should we do this should we no i gave
[38:05] you authority wife
[38:07] i gave you authority take care of the
[38:09] business and be good with this because
[38:11] you know my heart and i know your heart
[38:15] hallelujah
[38:17] it wouldn't be very good to keep you
[38:18] standing
[38:19] john 10 11-18
[38:22] i am the good shepherd
[38:24] the good shepherd giveth his life for
[38:27] the sheep
[38:29] but he that is a hireling and not the
[38:31] shepherd whose own sheep are not
[38:34] seeth the wolf coming
[38:36] and leaveth the sheep and fleethe
[38:38] and the wolf catcheth them and
[38:40] scattereth the sheep
[38:42] the hireling fleeth because
[38:45] he is an hiring
[38:47] and careth not for the sheep
[38:51] i am the good shepherd and know my sheep
[38:53] and am known of mine can we say amen to
[38:56] that
[38:57] amen not a one-sided relationship
[39:00] as the father knoweth me even so i the
[39:03] father and i lay down my life
[39:06] for the sheep
[39:08] and other sheep i have which are not of
[39:10] this fold
[39:12] them also i must bring and they shall
[39:15] hear my voice and there shall be one
[39:18] fold and one shepherd
[39:20] therefore doth my father love me because
[39:23] i lay down my life that i might take it
[39:26] again amen no man taketh it from me
[39:31] i want you to catch these words let's go
[39:32] back to verse 17. therefore doth my
[39:35] father love me because i lay down my
[39:39] life amen
[39:41] very very clear you might say stiff
[39:45] right here again saints
[39:47] we don't believe as it were in a works
[39:49] gospel write a checklist that we just
[39:50] check off and say okay i got that i got
[39:52] that i got that but the word of god in
[39:55] you and i will cause us to do the work
[39:57] of god
[39:58] so the work my brother and sister is
[40:01] what is taking place no man taketh it
[40:04] from me but i lay it down of myself
[40:08] i have power to lay it down and i have
[40:10] power to take it again
[40:12] this commandment
[40:14] have i received of my father amen
[40:17] heavenly father we just ask you to be
[40:18] with us this evening speak to our hearts
[40:21] we pray in the name of jesus christ amen
[40:24] you may be seated saints
[40:26] now as i lay this out to you
[40:29] uh my brother and sister this evening
[40:32] we're not even going as it were to
[40:34] include the unbeliever in our
[40:36] conversation this is not that we're
[40:39] going to make a comparison of the
[40:41] believer and the unbeliever we're not
[40:44] going to talk about other spirits that
[40:46] are in the land today but the holy
[40:47] spirit that is in you amen we're going
[40:50] to talk about this word in this
[40:51] relationship that we have now my brother
[40:54] and sister there are i
[40:57] i will touch on the edge or fringe of
[40:59] this there are those people around the
[41:01] message who believe that the real crux
[41:04] or
[41:05] a move of the message is for us to
[41:07] recognize that god sent a prophet now
[41:09] when i say that i take that for granted
[41:12] i hope that you understand where i'm
[41:13] coming from i read malachi 4 and i
[41:17] believe malachi 4 so i know that the
[41:20] elijah will come in my day i don't have
[41:22] to look around any longer and see if we
[41:25] can find the elijah has he been
[41:27] vindicated did he do what the word said
[41:30] he would do my brother and sister i put
[41:32] this in a context that that is behind us
[41:35] that we as believers recognize when the
[41:38] prophet said that i come to point you to
[41:41] jesus christ we see that the job is done
[41:44] amen we're not still looking for the
[41:47] sign pointing us but the introduction to
[41:49] jesus christ has been made and um you
[41:53] know just drawing some things out that
[41:55] we study and i probably should you know
[41:58] put a chapter and verse as it were to
[42:00] them that my brother and sister the
[42:02] prophet of god talking about and it will
[42:05] be right here in scripture as we get in
[42:06] just a few minutes that this whole
[42:08] purpose of being that jesus christ come
[42:11] and the word being open was to redeem
[42:15] what was lost and he talks about the
[42:17] title deed he talks about those things
[42:20] and and so my brother and sister it's
[42:22] not that when the title deed got cloudy
[42:25] and fuzzy uh my brother and sister in
[42:27] the natural life we will look and you
[42:30] buy a home and in the world we live in
[42:33] today it's kind of a mandatory thing
[42:35] with the banks that they have to do a
[42:37] title search and the reason is is that
[42:40] they don't want you obligated in a
[42:42] mortgage to to come along one day and
[42:45] someone else knock on the door and say
[42:47] you're living in my house and so you
[42:50] know it's there that the title deed uh
[42:53] as it is has been researched and brought
[42:56] to clarity the light has been shined on
[42:58] it and that's why tonight it has become
[43:01] and i when i use this word common i
[43:03] don't mean that in a negative sense but
[43:04] it has become common to us for us to
[43:07] recognize that we were in christ before
[43:10] the foundation of the world you know why
[43:12] that revelation is so clear to us
[43:15] because we saw him go back and research
[43:19] the title and he himself has issued the
[43:23] title deed that says they are mine
[43:27] amen there's nothing cloudy in the title
[43:30] there's no second mortgage third
[43:32] mortgage there's no other obligation but
[43:35] he has complete clarity these people are
[43:38] my people amen as the scripture says
[43:41] they were once not a people but now they
[43:44] are a people how is that my brother and
[43:46] sister because the title has been
[43:48] researched from beginning to end and
[43:51] clarity has been shown upon that amen so
[43:54] as you look at that now as we know
[43:58] my brother and sister that that the very
[44:00] life of jesus christ
[44:02] is not just supposed to be manifested in
[44:05] you and i but it
[44:06] is right we're not looking for a day to
[44:10] come that we might actually walk talk
[44:12] believe and whatever like a christian
[44:14] but we are christians in other words we
[44:17] are the very christ-like of the earth
[44:22] the word says that they would be present
[44:23] but it also says that they would be in a
[44:25] minority and it also says that they
[44:28] would be despised
[44:30] amen
[44:33] i'm going to speak maybe in some strong
[44:35] terms tonight and maybe if someone
[44:38] didn't really have a good clarity they
[44:39] might say what is he talking about i
[44:41] don't agree but did you know my brother
[44:43] and sister as we read this scripture in
[44:45] john
[44:46] and jesus says that i have
[44:49] uh uh the authority the ability to lay
[44:53] my life down myself in other words i
[44:56] have come out i have made a decision i
[44:59] am anointed and i can lay my life down
[45:03] but he does remind us i can take it back
[45:05] up now did you know my brother and
[45:07] sister that we have that exact same
[45:09] authority tonight amen when we come in a
[45:13] complete submission to the word of god
[45:16] we are actually laying our life down in
[45:20] type of the word of god that we are
[45:22] saying lord i am coming in a complete
[45:25] submission to your word so i lay myself
[45:28] down
[45:30] but get this saints
[45:31] i also possess the power
[45:34] to raise it back up again
[45:36] now i'm not talking like i said we're
[45:37] not going to go into those negative
[45:38] sides it's not oh i can just go serve
[45:41] any god i want i can prove to you
[45:43] through the word of god that you can't
[45:45] serve any god you want
[45:47] you were called of almighty god he's put
[45:50] his stamp upon you you belong to him
[45:53] amen so it's not within our ability my
[45:56] brother and sister to just say well i'm
[45:58] just going to go become a something else
[45:59] over here because god called you and he
[46:02] placed that seed in you and that seed is
[46:04] so overpowering in its claim upon your
[46:07] life
[46:08] now you say but many people have walked
[46:10] away yes my brother and sister and i
[46:12] believe many of those people will return
[46:17] you cannot deny the worst with the
[46:19] ideology of i have rights
[46:22] then i have this and i have that it is a
[46:25] supernatural event my brother and sister
[46:28] when you come and come to the word and
[46:32] say i lay myself down i lay my life down
[46:36] to the word i completely surrender and
[46:39] submit to the word you are following the
[46:41] same anointed spirit that will come down
[46:45] on the flesh man jesus christ when he
[46:48] was there to submit himself was it easy
[46:51] he says no lord let this pass from me
[46:54] but nevertheless
[46:56] oh are you with me tonight saying but
[46:59] nevertheless lord what's more important
[47:01] to me is thy will be done
[47:05] amen
[47:06] now we wouldn't even have a plan of
[47:08] redemption if jesus at the last minute
[47:10] said no i'm not going through with this
[47:12] but you see he couldn't step back from
[47:13] that because it was god himself
[47:16] fulfilling the plan of redemption that
[47:18] started the whole thing and we say oh
[47:21] it's a wonderful calvary that redemption
[47:23] my brother and sister the lamb was slain
[47:25] before the foundation of the world go
[47:27] back on your title deed and see where it
[47:29] began
[47:30] amen we have my brother and sister
[47:33] through the act of laying our life down
[47:36] this submission to the word
[47:38] we are then by
[47:40] the grace of god
[47:43] granted the right
[47:45] to take our life back up again amen
[47:49] now the naysayer would argue and say
[47:50] brother paul you're you're talking like
[47:52] you have some authority yes i do
[47:56] hallelujah i've been given authority my
[47:58] brother and sister to bind spirits and
[48:00] loose spirits i've been given authority
[48:03] to speak the word and god honor it amen
[48:06] is that not what we believe amen so
[48:09] we've been granted this but you notice
[48:11] when a person has come truly under the
[48:14] influence of the baptism of the holy
[48:16] spirit there is not a selfish motive of
[48:20] their behavior
[48:22] i want to be a superior christian
[48:25] no you might want to submit and be all
[48:28] that god called you to do but it doesn't
[48:29] come in the mindset of me me me it's
[48:33] constantly us
[48:35] laying ourselves down
[48:37] but then when the word comes and the
[48:39] situation i'll call it of life
[48:41] then god grants to us my brother and
[48:43] sister the ability
[48:45] by our own
[48:46] voice amen
[48:48] not the preacher's voice
[48:50] not not even as it were you know to have
[48:52] to go find the right tape
[48:54] to play it at the right moment to have
[48:56] it be the voice but god said brother
[48:58] brown says you know just paraphrasing
[49:00] his back
[49:01] you will be the final voice
[49:03] to the final age so there's got to be
[49:05] authority granted to you to know the
[49:08] time and the place to speak
[49:11] amen and it's in that speaking that you
[49:14] are then raising the word of god we're
[49:15] not raising an eye or me on us we're
[49:18] raising the word what is it we submitted
[49:21] to the word and now we have the
[49:24] authority to lift the word back up and
[49:27] to put it into action oh isn't that
[49:30] beautiful
[49:32] hallelujah
[49:33] reminds me of a little story once
[49:36] family they built a house for their i
[49:38] think it was their father
[49:41] and it's a modern house
[49:45] and they put the garage door opener on
[49:46] grandpa's visor
[49:48] and they told them grandpa when you walk
[49:50] in the garage you just push this button
[49:54] well grandpa's not used to that he
[49:55] forgot all about it
[49:57] one day they come to the house and
[49:59] there's grandpa in the rain getting out
[50:02] of his car
[50:03] opening the door with the key going in
[50:05] the garage
[50:06] pulling the string
[50:08] raising the garage door
[50:11] and they're like why do you do that
[50:12] grandpa he says well that's what i have
[50:14] to do to get in the garage
[50:16] and they said no grandfather i hope you
[50:18] catch the gist of this
[50:20] grandfather it's within your power
[50:23] to reach get this now on the visor
[50:25] remember these little keys of the story
[50:28] it's within your power
[50:31] to reach up
[50:34] and release the power amen that opens
[50:37] that for
[50:38] you saints that's what god's done for us
[50:41] i know that's kind of a simple little
[50:42] story but
[50:43] god's given us the ability to reach up
[50:46] and give us the power to open the word
[50:48] in our life
[50:50] open the word in our time of need open
[50:52] the word when we just need an
[50:54] encouraging word and there's no one
[50:56] there in the flesh
[50:59] but the spirit is there
[51:01] you see
[51:04] we have that act the ability to be
[51:06] lifted up
[51:08] through submission
[51:10] we are lifted up and we see that in the
[51:13] very story of our lord jesus christ see
[51:16] it's not our self being lifted up
[51:17] remember my brother and sister now i
[51:19] that this will tie to a little
[51:21] fellowship we had uh with brother trevor
[51:23] and sister kerry uh that uh caused us to
[51:26] go uh read and and whatnot the uh sermon
[51:29] oneness and uh just tremendous my
[51:32] brothers and sisters sometimes how
[51:34] something will speak to you and you know
[51:36] it is not my brother and sister that
[51:39] this flesh is also important you know
[51:41] that
[51:42] the prophet of god says this flesh is
[51:44] just a byproduct
[51:46] it's just a complete separate almost
[51:48] disposable thing
[51:51] oh but that soul
[51:53] oh but that's all can somebody say
[51:55] hallelujah oh but that soul come from
[51:58] the very spirit of god from the very
[52:01] beginning not a byproduct out of adam
[52:05] but the original spirit of almighty god
[52:09] is what resides in you and i tonight
[52:12] hallelujah you talk about an original
[52:14] word in original life amen
[52:17] not a you know change for the age kind
[52:19] of a spirit but the very spirit of god
[52:22] has come down amen the spirit of christ
[52:25] in us
[52:26] now as we look at this in scriptural
[52:28] signs of the times and certainly i think
[52:30] this is a time of the world of history
[52:34] that we want to be looking at the
[52:36] scriptural signs for the times in the
[52:38] beginning was the word and the word was
[52:40] with god and the word was god the word
[52:42] was made flesh and dwelt among us
[52:45] and the word
[52:47] discerns the thoughts
[52:51] now i don't mean to make a great
[52:52] reference but we just were
[52:53] fellowshipping around this
[52:55] the other night
[52:58] people say i came to church brother paul
[53:00] and
[53:01] the very scripture that you read i've
[53:04] been reading
[53:05] the very thing you spoke on was
[53:07] conversation that we were having
[53:11] boy brother paul must be awesome huh
[53:14] no sir this is a promise of the word
[53:17] that he would discern the very intents
[53:21] of our hearts
[53:23] and so you see it's god
[53:25] that's speaking back it's not a man
[53:29] it's the holy ghost confirming to you
[53:32] what i spoke to you here what you saw
[53:34] here he's just coming back giving the
[53:36] reassurance that was my word that's the
[53:39] truth that's it you're you're on the
[53:41] right track see so the word discerns the
[53:44] thoughts and when we spend our time my
[53:46] brother and sister thinking and our
[53:48] thoughts and our words and our voice is
[53:50] upon our lord jesus christ then he's
[53:52] there discerning that and what is he
[53:54] saying oh look at that they're talking
[53:55] about me now we share this little term i
[53:58] hope you kind of can catch the you might
[54:00] say humor i put in it but every one of
[54:02] you don't even bother to deny it
[54:06] you don't even know what i'm talking
[54:07] about and you're like what
[54:09] don't even deny it every one of us likes
[54:11] to hear a good word spoken about ourself
[54:16] come on even the most backwards whatever
[54:19] when somebody you maybe just hear it was
[54:21] out in the foyer or a fellowship you
[54:23] know and it might be as simple as
[54:25] somebody's like oh
[54:26] they make such good
[54:28] this or such that they're so sweet
[54:31] they just you know always encourage
[54:34] these little words come on saints we
[54:36] like that imagine now we're created in
[54:39] the image of our father
[54:42] and in that you can draw this direct
[54:45] correlation that when we as sons and
[54:47] daughters of god are walking through
[54:50] life giving praise talking about the
[54:52] glory of god his kindness his love his
[54:54] grace his mercy he is their attentive
[54:57] they are thinking about me they're
[54:59] speaking of me amen look i think we can
[55:01] make a a connection to those two
[55:04] brothers walking to the road to emmaus
[55:07] speaking of him is what actually draw
[55:10] him to them
[55:12] hallelujah
[55:14] see is the word
[55:16] in the prophets
[55:18] it was the word i'm going to slow down
[55:21] here it was the word in the prophets i
[55:22] think we can all just say praise the
[55:24] lord it's a word in the prophet and you
[55:26] can get just around the message a
[55:28] hundred percent amen out of it's the
[55:31] word in the prophets
[55:34] it was a word in the sun
[55:37] people
[55:38] just fall down on their face and say
[55:41] that you are messed up and you think too
[55:43] highly of yourself when you start
[55:44] talking about it's the word in me
[55:48] it's jesus christ in me today that has
[55:51] given me the authority given you the
[55:54] authority to bind devils
[55:58] and to lose the holy spirit within your
[56:00] own life within your family within the
[56:03] household within the body of christ that
[56:05] word has given you the authority
[56:08] amen see
[56:11] the word
[56:12] it's prophesied promised although you
[56:15] find many impersonations
[56:18] now isn't this sad
[56:19] that the imperson sometimes
[56:21] impersonation sometimes can shake people
[56:24] so much
[56:27] you know what i don't want to be a
[56:30] i hope you
[56:31] i feel good tonight okay saints just
[56:33] forgive me if i'm a little
[56:35] but when i was in school
[56:37] kids don't listen to me this is what you
[56:39] don't want to be when i was in school i
[56:41] figured out exactly the percentage it
[56:43] took
[56:44] to pass the class
[56:46] and i did no more than that
[56:48] sad isn't it
[56:50] i can get through this class on a 64.
[56:55] and i did a 65.
[57:03] but i want you to look at this
[57:05] these impersonations
[57:07] are offering options to get through the
[57:10] class
[57:12] with the least
[57:14] submission
[57:16] with the least surrender
[57:19] with the least
[57:20] giving over
[57:26] help us lord that's right
[57:28] we don't want to just pass the class
[57:30] saints
[57:31] i know that that's not how the kingdom
[57:33] of heaven is saints but you know if you
[57:36] got there and saint peter said and paul
[57:40] you made it ah praise the lord
[57:42] on a d
[57:43] minus minus
[57:47] there's nothing about that saints i
[57:49] shared this tonight from my heart how it
[57:50] struck me through the years in my own
[57:52] metamorphosis in my own life i used to
[57:55] even speak it out of my lips if i can
[57:57] just crawl over the threshold into
[57:59] heaven
[58:00] i'll be happy
[58:02] but you see something happened in my
[58:04] life along the way that i realized god
[58:06] did not call for me just to submit just
[58:09] enough to crawl over the threshold but
[58:11] god said i have placed in you an ability
[58:15] to stand up and manifest my word and not
[58:19] only if we were putting in that not only
[58:21] pass
[58:22] but to pass with the a a a plus plus
[58:27] plus
[58:28] you know i went to school with a girl
[58:30] her name was vicky i think he was smart
[58:32] that he had no common sense but it don't
[58:34] matter they don't grade you on common
[58:36] sense in school
[58:38] and i just remember at the end of our
[58:40] junior year
[58:41] all things being done i knew vicki
[58:44] and vicki is like i don't understand she
[58:46] goes up to vice principal i don't
[58:48] understand
[58:51] and he's like what understand vicky
[58:54] how come my report card
[58:57] it's very common now but it wasn't back
[58:59] then
[59:00] says that i actually had a 104 percent
[59:07] 104
[59:09] well when you only have 65 percent 104
[59:12] percent doesn't mean much
[59:14] the saints you see we're not called to
[59:17] come into a day to submit ourselves into
[59:21] that half-hearted
[59:23] non-committed position as sons and
[59:25] daughters of god
[59:27] amen i hope this makes sense to you see
[59:29] the word it's prophesied it's promised
[59:32] although you'll find many implications
[59:36] don't let the impersonation draw you to
[59:38] the side we have the original we have
[59:39] the word
[59:41] mini carnal
[59:42] competition
[59:45] now i take the prophet's words they're
[59:47] very serious because when you look
[59:48] around amongst these different doctrines
[59:51] it seems as though there's a competition
[59:54] well i tell you saints now i hope you
[59:56] understand me tonight i love every one
[59:58] of you so much so much i just makes my
[1:00:00] bones hurt
[1:00:03] but this is not a competition
[1:00:05] if god told you move
[1:00:07] all i could say is god bless you
[1:00:10] we don't start creating a a scenario
[1:00:13] where you you think you're gonna
[1:00:14] backslide or you're gonna fake no this
[1:00:17] is not a competition we our part for the
[1:00:21] season that god called us and if the
[1:00:23] season is 10 months 10 years or decades
[1:00:27] it is up to the lord where he places his
[1:00:30] sheep because i read you the scripture
[1:00:32] where he says i have many folds
[1:00:35] but i bring them under one shepherd
[1:00:39] oh my that sure takes it out of man's
[1:00:41] control right there and i can say thank
[1:00:43] you lord
[1:00:44] that doesn't take away from it from the
[1:00:46] real there is a real holy ghost a real
[1:00:50] god
[1:00:51] amen i don't care how many
[1:00:53] disappointments you face at the end of
[1:00:55] ministers or churches you keep that in
[1:00:58] your heart there's a real holy ghost
[1:01:00] there's a real god and it's the devil
[1:01:03] that wants us to lower our standard and
[1:01:06] our view from the heavenly back to the
[1:01:08] carnal and then judge god by the carnal
[1:01:12] that's the devil's fashion right there
[1:01:15] amen
[1:01:16] hallelujah very simple things my brother
[1:01:19] and sister but we're going to just
[1:01:20] expose the devil and just remind him
[1:01:22] he's got a hedge around him
[1:01:25] he knows that he doesn't like the idea
[1:01:27] amen
[1:01:28] that he has a hedge around himself
[1:01:32] praise the lord
[1:01:34] now
[1:01:35] i want to just take this right out of
[1:01:37] here we have found him come and see can
[1:01:39] anyone say amen to that hallelujah now
[1:01:42] look then he's here
[1:01:44] and look as it is i lord you guys
[1:01:47] forgive me lord forgive me sometimes i
[1:01:49] maybe almost mockingly say i cherry pick
[1:01:52] this
[1:01:53] that's just because i
[1:01:55] have hurt feelings
[1:02:00] a people whose excuse for rejecting what
[1:02:02] you have taken out of the message
[1:02:04] is to say you cherry-picked that
[1:02:07] like i could have cherry-picked the
[1:02:09] previous 50 quotes and the following 50
[1:02:12] quotes
[1:02:13] but there would still be some kind of
[1:02:15] cherry picking
[1:02:17] and um
[1:02:18] you know i could just pick the quotes
[1:02:22] where he talks about
[1:02:24] spit the pits out
[1:02:26] and i could read it verbatim week after
[1:02:28] week after week
[1:02:29] and people wouldn't like it because they
[1:02:31] don't want to spit the pits out
[1:02:35] they want to keep the pits
[1:02:41] where two or three are gathered no
[1:02:42] matter how small a group
[1:02:46] can i make another confession to y'all
[1:02:50] time of my life pastor in the church we
[1:02:52] were very small and i was like oh lord
[1:02:54] if we just had some more believers if we
[1:02:56] just had some more people and the lord's
[1:02:58] answered my prayer
[1:02:59] i used to pray all the time lord bring
[1:03:01] children
[1:03:02] there's the life of a church right there
[1:03:04] saints bring children lord bring cheryl
[1:03:06] i was like lord oh if we could just
[1:03:08] maybe have a church like this many
[1:03:10] people i'm gonna name that number so you
[1:03:12] can't use it against me
[1:03:14] this many people lorne
[1:03:16] but you know what happened to
[1:03:17] metamorphosis has taken place in my life
[1:03:21] lord
[1:03:22] i'll settle for this
[1:03:24] little little group
[1:03:27] of real believers
[1:03:30] i don't need a church full i don't need
[1:03:33] all of this i just want to go to church
[1:03:36] i want a fellowship i want to live life
[1:03:40] in the presence of real believers
[1:03:43] even if that is a small number
[1:03:48] two or three i'll be in their midst
[1:03:51] what anything
[1:03:53] they ask
[1:03:54] shall receive it
[1:03:56] are you following me now saints why i'm
[1:03:58] choosing this quote
[1:04:00] we have
[1:04:01] the anointing of almighty god
[1:04:03] to lay it down
[1:04:06] now comes
[1:04:08] our time
[1:04:09] to raise it up
[1:04:11] now comes our time that we say lord
[1:04:15] this is the desire of our heart
[1:04:18] and sometimes we think that's only
[1:04:19] brother brown makes reference about uh
[1:04:21] in in other
[1:04:22] quotes in places about healing and
[1:04:24] people say yep that has to do with
[1:04:26] healing but did you know that could be
[1:04:27] as simple as something as it were be a
[1:04:29] necessity in our life and i just want to
[1:04:32] ask you right now has god answered any
[1:04:33] prayers for you lately
[1:04:35] amen has god come and moved on the
[1:04:37] things that we would say well this
[1:04:39] really has no great spiritual bearing
[1:04:41] but it was on your heart
[1:04:44] it was a desire of your heart
[1:04:47] now my brother and sister were not the
[1:04:49] ones that are saying oh lord
[1:04:51] i i like a house lord i like it on
[1:04:55] miami on the beach
[1:04:58] and it needs an olympic pool and a
[1:05:00] tennis court
[1:05:02] and it needs to be 10 000 square feet
[1:05:04] see that's not the believer
[1:05:08] but we get hindered to say lord
[1:05:11] am i carnal if i ask
[1:05:13] for these things
[1:05:15] but look how god moves because he's
[1:05:18] removing the carnality out of the heart
[1:05:22] of the true believer
[1:05:25] and so now
[1:05:26] these things and i don't mean them to
[1:05:28] imply uh in a certain fashion but it is
[1:05:31] my example
[1:05:32] amen we're here lord i need a place to
[1:05:35] live i need this i need that lord wheels
[1:05:38] are falling off the car lord i need a
[1:05:39] car you can do this and if we're not
[1:05:41] careful satan anoints us in a level that
[1:05:44] we think we're being carnal but you see
[1:05:46] the word says ask anything
[1:05:51] am i stepping out onto thin ice saints
[1:05:55] because you see
[1:05:57] god knows the heart
[1:05:59] of the person who's asking
[1:06:02] he knows the desire of that individual
[1:06:09] what anything they ask shall receive it
[1:06:11] now that's either right
[1:06:13] or it's wrong
[1:06:15] in other words there's no gray area in
[1:06:17] the middle of this saints we either
[1:06:19] believe that we can ask and god will
[1:06:21] grant or we don't
[1:06:31] jesus said if you abide in me and my
[1:06:33] word in you you can ask what you will
[1:06:35] it'll be done to you whatsoever things
[1:06:38] you desire when you pray believe
[1:06:41] uh believe you receive it that's but
[1:06:43] watch the order of the word now you
[1:06:45] believe now
[1:06:47] you receive
[1:06:49] amen
[1:06:51] isn't it amazing how god always puts
[1:06:52] that little
[1:06:53] caveat in there puts that little you
[1:06:55] know
[1:06:56] part in there
[1:06:58] so we can't come to church and just say
[1:06:59] oh praise god the word says
[1:07:02] no we have to believe
[1:07:04] we have to believe we can't just put a
[1:07:06] sub-standard and let me tie this back to
[1:07:09] why i brought in the report card we
[1:07:10] can't believe we're going to graduate
[1:07:12] high school
[1:07:14] unless
[1:07:16] we act
[1:07:20] we can say we graduated we can say we
[1:07:23] should have graduated and when we don't
[1:07:25] graduate we should we can say they
[1:07:28] should have graduated me
[1:07:30] and that is what's happened in the
[1:07:31] christian world saints so many people
[1:07:34] have failed to lay their life down
[1:07:37] to the word
[1:07:39] but they still want god to raise it up
[1:07:42] no come on we have to have what brother
[1:07:44] branham preached we have to have a
[1:07:46] complete surrender
[1:07:49] complete submission that's right brother
[1:07:51] david
[1:07:52] so if you abide in me so you see we
[1:07:54] can't be that rebellious wife
[1:07:59] and expect the husband to be happy
[1:08:02] right
[1:08:03] and my word in you so this is
[1:08:06] oh my there's so many quote saints i
[1:08:08] don't want to get distracted off in that
[1:08:10] but so many places where the prophet of
[1:08:12] god talks about the word
[1:08:15] in you
[1:08:16] means god
[1:08:17] in you
[1:08:20] not just phraseology here this is not
[1:08:22] just just some you know pattern of words
[1:08:24] that is made to emphasize but this is
[1:08:27] the literal life
[1:08:29] amen
[1:08:31] so you believe that now watch the order
[1:08:33] see how he lays this out i believe it's
[1:08:35] very important we catch that watch the
[1:08:37] order of the word
[1:08:38] brother branham's laying this out now in
[1:08:40] an order so you believe
[1:08:43] then you receive
[1:08:46] do you know my brother and sister many
[1:08:48] times
[1:08:50] let me just put this as in the caveat of
[1:08:53] i believe it like this
[1:08:55] many times
[1:08:57] blessings
[1:08:58] healings deliverances
[1:09:00] are literally at our fingertips
[1:09:03] and we fail
[1:09:05] not the word
[1:09:07] we fail
[1:09:09] to take the next step
[1:09:11] to receive it
[1:09:15] see he can't do nothing for you
[1:09:19] you'll see right here my brother and
[1:09:20] sister what the next step is
[1:09:23] he can't do nothing for you
[1:09:25] until you first you believe it
[1:09:29] somebody read it to me
[1:09:32] and say
[1:09:34] what does this mean we got got to open
[1:09:36] our mouth
[1:09:38] we've got to make a declaration
[1:09:41] we've got to we've got to declare
[1:09:46] amen
[1:09:48] what happens
[1:09:50] holy spirit's moving in our midst and
[1:09:52] we're standing here waiting
[1:09:53] for it to happen
[1:09:55] anticipation waiting for it to happen
[1:09:58] amen
[1:10:01] let it come from our lips
[1:10:03] it's from the fruit of our lips that we
[1:10:05] praise god
[1:10:07] amen
[1:10:10] brother brown says let me let that soak
[1:10:12] real deep
[1:10:13] see it's a time my brother and sister
[1:10:15] that as sons and daughters of god here
[1:10:17] again i make this we don't go running
[1:10:19] out saying okay lord you're going to
[1:10:21] give me a big house you're going to give
[1:10:22] me a mercedes you're going to give me a
[1:10:24] yacht you're going to do all my brothers
[1:10:26] and sisters all contrary to the spirit
[1:10:28] all contrary to the word of god
[1:10:32] but for us to come and say lord
[1:10:34] you look at the sparrow
[1:10:37] and you know my needs you know my life
[1:10:40] lord this is my heart
[1:10:45] the answer to the prayer might not come
[1:10:46] looking like you thought
[1:10:48] but it will come
[1:10:52] so we look at this
[1:10:54] what we're laying our lives down my
[1:10:56] brother and sister is not submission to
[1:10:57] men
[1:10:58] to a denomination to whatever we're
[1:11:01] laying our lives down in submission to
[1:11:04] the word
[1:11:05] and you know how hard that can be now
[1:11:07] i'm just going to speak frankly people
[1:11:09] have certain
[1:11:10] certain situations in their life
[1:11:12] and they look into the word of god and
[1:11:14] the word of god speaks back very frankly
[1:11:17] to them very direct to them and then we
[1:11:20] have this choice
[1:11:23] i submit to the word or we start to
[1:11:28] craft
[1:11:29] and i've said it jokingly in the church
[1:11:30] here and i've said it seriously in the
[1:11:32] church here but my brother and sister
[1:11:34] we're all justified
[1:11:37] some of us are justified by the word and
[1:11:39] some of us are justified by our own
[1:11:42] reasoning
[1:11:43] but we will craft it
[1:11:45] i can remember a time if i could
[1:11:48] put myself on the
[1:11:49] ladder as it were
[1:11:51] remember a time there was a situation
[1:11:53] took place and some interaction with a
[1:11:56] brother this many years ago
[1:11:58] and you know i kind of felt like i you
[1:12:00] know this is so hard saints sound like i
[1:12:03] have a head this big
[1:12:05] i was right
[1:12:08] but my spirit wasn't
[1:12:12] and because i was right
[1:12:15] i felt like i needed to let him know in
[1:12:17] no uncertain terms how right i was
[1:12:23] and then the lord the very next service
[1:12:25] minister speaking
[1:12:27] brought me up in front of the church and
[1:12:30] whipped me no that's how i felt um
[1:12:37] and i felt like i should just go make
[1:12:38] that right with that brother
[1:12:40] but do you know that every day that went
[1:12:43] by
[1:12:44] i justified the reason i didn't need to
[1:12:48] more
[1:12:49] and more
[1:12:50] and more
[1:12:52] until god had to send another minister
[1:12:54] to preach a very similar service as the
[1:12:58] previous
[1:12:59] visiting minister
[1:13:01] and i felt like at that time i better
[1:13:03] just shut up and do what the lord wanted
[1:13:04] me to do
[1:13:06] and you know i went and i apologized
[1:13:08] and he apologized to me and we wrapped
[1:13:10] our arms around each other and walked
[1:13:12] away with no
[1:13:14] no nothing
[1:13:17] and he says
[1:13:18] paul
[1:13:21] my wife says
[1:13:22] you ever heard that one
[1:13:25] my wife says
[1:13:27] i should have done that
[1:13:29] like
[1:13:30] three weeks ago and i'm like
[1:13:34] three weeks ago is the same sunday
[1:13:38] god dealt with my heart
[1:13:40] but you see what happens we start to
[1:13:42] justify our reason
[1:13:44] and so we don't submit to the moving of
[1:13:47] the holy spirit
[1:13:48] we start building our case our defense
[1:13:52] or i can stand up and say well i did
[1:13:54] what i did because they did what they
[1:13:56] did and they said this and they said no
[1:13:57] no when god deals with a heart submit
[1:14:01] just lay it down lord if you want me to
[1:14:03] say i'm sorry then lord i i will go and
[1:14:06] apologize
[1:14:07] amen so we want to my brother and sister
[1:14:10] follow this in the word in such a
[1:14:12] fashion see that we lay ourselves down
[1:14:15] in submission not as i said to the
[1:14:18] church to some preachers but to the word
[1:14:22] to the holy spirit there's where we lay
[1:14:24] ourselves down in submission
[1:14:25] and so it's only through that act of
[1:14:27] laying it down that it sets the stage
[1:14:30] for the manifestation of the word
[1:14:34] god answers prayer
[1:14:39] when our heart
[1:14:44] condemns us
[1:14:46] not
[1:14:48] then
[1:14:49] we have confidence
[1:14:52] in god
[1:14:54] you see god's not going to batter us
[1:14:55] into that saints but he wants us to come
[1:14:57] to the place a heart that is completely
[1:14:59] submitted into the word
[1:15:02] is free
[1:15:03] it's delivered it's got liberty
[1:15:05] amen it's got confidence we can then
[1:15:08] look at the word of god and say praise
[1:15:09] the lord this word that is being spoken
[1:15:12] i'm reading i'm hearing is for me and it
[1:15:16] is effective it is real it is alive and
[1:15:19] so through that we then set the stage
[1:15:22] for the manifestation of the word in our
[1:15:24] life in other words saints at that point
[1:15:27] we can speak the words that starts
[1:15:29] raising it back up
[1:15:33] isn't that amazing
[1:15:34] how in submission
[1:15:36] we can come with such authority
[1:15:39] because you see this is the perfect plan
[1:15:41] of god why because it's in the very plan
[1:15:43] that god laid out before us in the life
[1:15:46] of our lord jesus christ the very works
[1:15:48] that he did the word says that we would
[1:15:50] do those same kind of works and so we're
[1:15:52] all looking for a supernatural healing
[1:15:54] over here in a supernatural discernment
[1:15:56] over here but what about the same works
[1:15:58] that it did is the work of submission
[1:16:03] we're going to do that same work that he
[1:16:05] did and it might be not something that
[1:16:07] makes him you look so spiritual doesn't
[1:16:09] make you look so whatever but it is
[1:16:11] simply you following in that same nature
[1:16:14] that anointed our lord jesus christ to
[1:16:16] go to calvary for us is laying our life
[1:16:18] down under that same anointing that can
[1:16:21] be raised up again
[1:16:23] hallelujah and then to have authority
[1:16:25] with the word
[1:16:27] amen we set the stage get this i want to
[1:16:30] drive this home to you
[1:16:31] now i'm preaching to mature christians
[1:16:33] tonight okay it's not me
[1:16:36] there is no good thing in me the
[1:16:38] scripture says and i say amen to that
[1:16:41] but it is god working in us
[1:16:45] is the good thing amen so what happens
[1:16:47] the holy ghost in you and i sets the
[1:16:50] stage for you and i to come to a place
[1:16:54] where just we see this testimony of our
[1:16:56] sister sarah
[1:16:58] did you notice
[1:17:00] what her testimony really was
[1:17:03] i didn't get invited to pray for her
[1:17:08] come on follow me saints
[1:17:11] sister sarah never reached out
[1:17:14] brother paul i don't feel good
[1:17:17] pray for me
[1:17:19] but there were
[1:17:21] some believers
[1:17:23] there was some christians
[1:17:26] there were some people
[1:17:28] that had authority
[1:17:30] before the throne of god
[1:17:32] and their prayers reached right out
[1:17:35] she lays down with a fever feeling very
[1:17:37] sick low oxygen whatever i i don't
[1:17:40] remember the order she puts that in
[1:17:42] in a couple hours
[1:17:44] prayers
[1:17:46] going to the throne
[1:17:48] prayers going to the throne
[1:17:51] prayers going to the throne
[1:17:53] and with authority
[1:17:55] of the word
[1:17:57] raises her up
[1:18:00] that saints is what makes a body of
[1:18:03] believers
[1:18:04] defensible against the onslaught of the
[1:18:07] devil
[1:18:08] because there is submitted people we're
[1:18:10] not here trying to see who is the most
[1:18:13] impressive family in our church we're
[1:18:16] here to be submitted to god to give him
[1:18:19] full rule and reign in our lives and in
[1:18:22] turn he comes back and says i give you
[1:18:25] authority to bind these spirits i give
[1:18:27] you authority to claim healing in the
[1:18:29] name of jesus christ deliverance in the
[1:18:31] name of jesus christ i give you the
[1:18:33] authority to lead your families amen
[1:18:38] and for your children to see
[1:18:40] this
[1:18:41] is not just a game
[1:18:44] this is real
[1:18:45] this is life and the supernatural power
[1:18:48] of god can be anointed upon us
[1:18:51] not from our birth
[1:18:54] joking
[1:18:56] with my son-in-law today with brother
[1:18:57] isaac for just a moment they come to get
[1:18:59] the kids and
[1:19:02] little ewan had a fever all day and kids
[1:19:05] just not feeling good
[1:19:07] i was joking with brother isaac and i
[1:19:09] said i just wonder why
[1:19:11] i wasn't born with the last name
[1:19:13] rothschild

[1:19:24] outshines them all
[1:19:26] i've got a home in glory land hallelujah
[1:19:30] amen see my brother and sister there's a
[1:19:33] reason i'm happy my last name ain't
[1:19:34] roth's child because if there is no ross
[1:19:37] tiles on the lamb's book of life i
[1:19:39] wouldn't want to be rich in this world
[1:19:40] for no reason
[1:19:42] amen
[1:19:43] now look let me hurry along
[1:19:46] you know
[1:19:47] every time i tell sister jerry i ain't
[1:19:49] got much to preach she just was like
[1:19:51] don't say that please don't say that

[1:19:59] which was of the sata of galilee desired
[1:20:02] him saying sir we would see jesus
[1:20:05] philip cometh and televander and again
[1:20:07] andrew and philip tell jesus and jesus
[1:20:10] answered them saying the hour has come
[1:20:12] that the son of man should be glorified
[1:20:15] and you know that scripture and be
[1:20:16] fulfilled right here in grace tabernacle
[1:20:18] tonight
[1:20:19] verily verily i say unto you except a
[1:20:21] corn of wheat fallen to the ground and
[1:20:23] diet abideth alone but if it die it
[1:20:26] bringeth forth much fruit
[1:20:28] he that loveth his life shall lose it
[1:20:31] and he that hateth his life in this
[1:20:34] world shall keep it into life eternal
[1:20:37] let me interpret that scripture for you
[1:20:39] right there he that was willing to
[1:20:42] lay his life
[1:20:44] down in submission
[1:20:48] amen
[1:20:49] is that pretty pretty simple isn't it
[1:20:55] now you wonder sometimes what
[1:20:56] supernatural gifts god might give to you
[1:20:59] let me tell you tonight supernatural
[1:21:00] gift he's given to you
[1:21:02] is to conquer this flesh
[1:21:05] that is a supernatural
[1:21:07] gift of almighty god a supernatural
[1:21:09] anointing upon you is to crucify the
[1:21:13] flesh in the day that we live in
[1:21:17] if any man serve me let him follow me
[1:21:20] and where i am there shall also my
[1:21:22] servant be and if any man serve me him
[1:21:24] will my father honor now is my soul
[1:21:28] troubled and what shall i say father
[1:21:30] save me from this hour
[1:21:34] here it is jesus speaking save me from
[1:21:36] this hour
[1:21:39] save me from the circumstances
[1:21:48] but for this cause come i
[1:21:50] until this hour
[1:21:52] and i don't want to draw this out
[1:21:53] tonight saints but god didn't just
[1:21:54] accidentally place you in laodicea
[1:21:57] god didn't accident just accidentally
[1:21:59] place you in the in the time that we
[1:22:01] live
[1:22:02] he knows who you are
[1:22:04] and he knows that while he loosed that
[1:22:07] hedge around you he also knows the hedge
[1:22:12] he placed around the devil
[1:22:15] and as much as the devil would like to
[1:22:17] bust out
[1:22:19] he can't do it
[1:22:20] no more
[1:22:22] get this
[1:22:23] no more
[1:22:24] than he could bust in
[1:22:26] otherwise he wouldn't have been speaking
[1:22:28] and saying huh
[1:22:30] you've got a hedge around him
[1:22:33] look this hedge my brother and sister is
[1:22:35] a hedge that the devil can't penetrate
[1:22:39] and now when the devil
[1:22:41] realizes that you know that he's
[1:22:43] actually hedged in he likes you to
[1:22:44] believe hey god open the heads on you
[1:22:46] buddy
[1:22:48] lord why'd you do that to me well one
[1:22:49] he's got confidence
[1:22:51] but two
[1:22:52] the devil's actually kind of nervous
[1:22:55] i hope you like this i hope you know a
[1:22:57] little humor tonight doesn't bother you
[1:22:59] amen
[1:23:01] when they put ropes
[1:23:02] around the boxing ring
[1:23:04] or in this modern day
[1:23:06] brutal beat each other to bloody mess
[1:23:09] whatever they call that fighting now
[1:23:14] think about it
[1:23:16] are you with me
[1:23:19] the devil's actually
[1:23:21] locked into this life
[1:23:23] with you
[1:23:26] we too often think about lord we got to
[1:23:29] get the devil away from us
[1:23:32] have a little sympathy for the devil
[1:23:33] tonight saints
[1:23:36] he's locked in
[1:23:38] the ring the hedge
[1:23:40] with you
[1:23:43] and that means this roaring lion
[1:23:46] will come out of their beat to a pulp
[1:23:49] and ready
[1:23:50] to be done dealing with you
[1:23:52] ready to say i'll just leave them alone
[1:23:57] because an anointed son or daughter of
[1:23:59] god oh will cower saints i'll just be
[1:24:02] honest i've cowered
[1:24:04] can someone say amen
[1:24:06] i have coward
[1:24:08] but by god's grace and mercy i'm coming
[1:24:11] to the place that it's like satan
[1:24:14] you're defeated you might as well submit
[1:24:17] i'm going to submit
[1:24:19] good
[1:24:20] then just be beaten
[1:24:21] by the word
[1:24:23] just be pummeled
[1:24:25] by the word
[1:24:27] now i've got to hurry got to hurry we
[1:24:29] were gonna be out and gone and i was
[1:24:30] gonna take you to dairy queen
[1:24:35] see people stood there stood by and okay
[1:24:38] let me find my place here
[1:24:40] for this cause come on to this hour
[1:24:42] father glorify thy name then come there
[1:24:45] a voice from heaven saying i have both
[1:24:47] glorified it and will glorify it again
[1:24:50] the people therefore that stood by and
[1:24:52] heard it said that it thundered
[1:24:55] and others said an angel spake to him
[1:24:57] and jesus answered and said
[1:24:59] get this saints
[1:25:01] jesus answered and said
[1:25:07] wrong scripture there
[1:25:08] 19 no
[1:25:10] one of i on
[1:25:12] i'm on 12. i'm sorry brother mason
[1:25:15] did i mess this up
[1:25:20] 12 and 30 is where we're looking jesus
[1:25:23] answered and said
[1:25:25] come on saints
[1:25:28] 12 and 30. i want you to read this for
[1:25:30] yourself
[1:25:33] some said it thunder and some said an
[1:25:35] angel spayed but jesus words were
[1:25:37] directed right to you and i
[1:25:40] this voice came not because of me
[1:25:44] but because of you
[1:25:46] that's how much authority god wanted to
[1:25:48] come he was speaking out to you
[1:25:51] this word that has come forth
[1:25:54] is not just so i can prove that i'm god
[1:25:57] but this word come
[1:25:59] for you
[1:26:00] amen
[1:26:01] jesus had no doubt what he could do to
[1:26:04] the devil
[1:26:05] but he wants you to catch the revelation
[1:26:08] of what you can do by
[1:26:11] laying your life down
[1:26:14] the whole world's built on this idea of
[1:26:16] lift ourselves up lift ourselves up
[1:26:18] dealing with a salesman a few days ago
[1:26:20] and i i wasn't sure if he was selling
[1:26:23] himself to me or selling a product to me
[1:26:26] and i did this and i this and i this and
[1:26:29] i was like yeah let's talk about this
[1:26:31] here i'm not concerned about you
[1:26:34] you see my brother and sister the voice
[1:26:36] didn't come
[1:26:37] but for you you know this is a direct
[1:26:39] correlation back to malachi
[1:26:42] behold i send you
[1:26:44] elijah the prophet
[1:26:46] a direct correlation comes back because
[1:26:48] god loves us so much my brother and
[1:26:50] sister that he's provided everything
[1:26:52] necessary
[1:26:53] amen
[1:26:54] now is the judgment of this world now
[1:26:56] shall the prince of this world be cast
[1:26:58] out
[1:27:01] but i kind of got a feeling and i don't
[1:27:03] say the smoking i say it from my heart
[1:27:05] the devil will be ready to be done with
[1:27:07] you
[1:27:07] before it's all over
[1:27:09] because you see one thing he can't stand
[1:27:11] is the word
[1:27:12] and as you become the word you realize
[1:27:16] that the word is the only thing that
[1:27:18] matters
[1:27:22] now i want to hurry through all of this
[1:27:23] so i'll skip over some things it might
[1:27:25] be a quote coming up but we'll kind of
[1:27:27] hurry through this my brother and sister
[1:27:29] when the devil come to
[1:27:30] jesus he had all authority he could have
[1:27:34] left hooked the devil right out of
[1:27:37] existence
[1:27:39] but he wanted to set an example because
[1:27:40] you see if jesus could do that and we
[1:27:43] know we can't
[1:27:44] we wouldn't even try
[1:27:46] so what did our lord jesus do
[1:27:50] he submitted himself
[1:27:52] to the word
[1:27:54] he kept going back to the word and the
[1:27:55] devil says look i'll give all of this
[1:27:57] brother branham in this quote i'm sure i
[1:27:58] have it here in the sermon i cut a bunch
[1:28:00] of mountain i'm pretty sure i am and he
[1:28:02] mentions the u.s but you see
[1:28:04] he offered him all of that
[1:28:07] jesus didn't say how you bum there ain't
[1:28:10] no way
[1:28:11] no
[1:28:12] he didn't argue with him
[1:28:14] he just said
[1:28:15] the word says
[1:28:17] isn't that so beautiful we can come
[1:28:19] right down in the day right here and no
[1:28:21] by submission to the word god then
[1:28:24] grants the authority of the word to you
[1:28:25] and i and when the devil comes in and
[1:28:28] starts to say this will be this way and
[1:28:29] this will be this weakness
[1:28:31] the word says
[1:28:33] the word says
[1:28:34] sorry devil but the word says now look
[1:28:37] let me hurry and i if i be lifted up
[1:28:39] from the earth will draw all men unto me
[1:28:43] not everyone my brother and sister now
[1:28:44] this people i've heard theologians
[1:28:47] interpret this that god's going to have
[1:28:48] this supernatural uh move and the whole
[1:28:51] earth is going to come and worship him
[1:28:52] and no my brother and sister this
[1:28:55] actually is a select
[1:28:57] group of people
[1:28:58] that have already lifted him out of the
[1:29:00] earth they've took him from the base
[1:29:02] things of life took him from an idol
[1:29:04] that they worship as a statue in their
[1:29:07] church or an image that is in their mind
[1:29:09] and had the relationship and took it to
[1:29:11] life
[1:29:12] brought it in fruition to life
[1:29:14] oh my oh my oh my
[1:29:19] you know we sing that song lift up the
[1:29:20] name of jesus you realize how important
[1:29:22] that is my brother and sister
[1:29:24] now let me hurry john 19 and 10
[1:29:27] then saith pilate unto him speaketh thou
[1:29:30] not unto me know us thou not that i have
[1:29:33] power to crucify and have power to
[1:29:35] release thee now look where jesus
[1:29:38] response is
[1:29:39] he is fulfilling the word of god i hope
[1:29:42] you catch the saints he's fulfilling the
[1:29:45] word of god and when we are fulfilling
[1:29:48] the word of god there is no other power
[1:29:52] in control of us
[1:29:58] think about it
[1:29:59] no other power
[1:30:01] that's why the prophet of god tells us
[1:30:04] if you're the will of god
[1:30:06] and things happen
[1:30:08] i'm paraphrasing it god has an
[1:30:10] obligation
[1:30:11] to correct that
[1:30:13] if you're out of the will of god
[1:30:16] then you have to get back in the will of
[1:30:18] god
[1:30:19] for god to move on your behalf
[1:30:22] see so here we have this now
[1:30:24] they've got no power at all
[1:30:27] we stay in the word we stay under the
[1:30:28] blood
[1:30:29] amen the devil's in the ring with us but
[1:30:32] that doesn't mean he's vanquishing us it
[1:30:34] doesn't mean he's in control just
[1:30:36] because he's locked inside that hedge
[1:30:39] amen
[1:30:41] jesus answer says thou couldest have no
[1:30:43] power at all
[1:30:46] imagine that must have been just hard
[1:30:47] for a pilot to swallow that
[1:30:50] i'm sorry sir
[1:30:52] i don't think the lord jesus would have
[1:30:53] been rude
[1:30:55] but you have
[1:30:57] no power
[1:30:59] oh man that'd just wrinkle wouldn't it
[1:31:01] man who's just flexed his authority his
[1:31:04] muscles is
[1:31:05] i have power over you you have no power
[1:31:09] come on
[1:31:11] let the devil and pilot
[1:31:14] be in the same boat tonight
[1:31:16] i have power over you
[1:31:21] you
[1:31:22] have no power
[1:31:25] no power
[1:31:26] i'm walking in the will of god
[1:31:29] i've lifted my soul up to him
[1:31:32] i've given myself an entirety
[1:31:38] and you have no power
[1:31:42] now i already spoke on job so we can
[1:31:45] kind of skip over that
[1:31:47] but it's very clear saints let me just
[1:31:49] put this on job
[1:31:51] very clear who was in charge
[1:31:55] job driven right down i read it to you
[1:31:57] out of psalms david saying my soul was
[1:32:00] driven right to the earth to the dirt
[1:32:05] but oh my god
[1:32:07] shall raise me up
[1:32:10] the devil's there i've got job gotcha
[1:32:12] i've got you yes go ahead just give up
[1:32:17] and the holy ghost comes starts to deal
[1:32:19] with us
[1:32:20] isn't this beautiful
[1:32:22] i thank god i don't know how much that
[1:32:24] means to you but i tell you what i have
[1:32:25] days that that absolutely is just a
[1:32:28] miraculous revelation
[1:32:30] amen can i have just
[1:32:33] a minute or two
[1:32:36] i want to do i'd like to just finish
[1:32:38] this up here how this quote it's
[1:32:39] beautiful
[1:32:41] and uh
[1:32:42] jesus said when he how many believe he
[1:32:44] was gone in the flesh let's see your
[1:32:45] hands
[1:32:49] we all believe that sure
[1:32:51] he was and when he was here on earth he
[1:32:53] had all the powers of god yeah this is
[1:32:55] that quote the
[1:32:56] powers of god was in him do you believe
[1:32:58] that he was a godhead bodily the
[1:33:00] fullness of the godhead bodily the bible
[1:33:03] said god was in christ reconciling the
[1:33:06] world to himself is that right jesus
[1:33:08] said it's not me that doeth the works
[1:33:12] now how many can identify that it's not
[1:33:14] me
[1:33:15] i recognize that boy if it was paul we
[1:33:18] would have a train wreck
[1:33:21] it's not me thank you lord
[1:33:24] it's not me that doeth the work it's my
[1:33:26] father dwelleth in me
[1:33:29] he doeth the works
[1:33:31] and when he met the devil yes i love
[1:33:33] this thank you lord that i concluded
[1:33:35] this amen he had every power that god's
[1:33:38] got was right in him
[1:33:39] now come on saints
[1:33:42] if you don't believe that you've got
[1:33:43] every power that god's got
[1:33:46] you are now limiting god
[1:33:48] now some people say you're twisting
[1:33:50] words you're twisting words but the
[1:33:52] scripture says that this is the time the
[1:33:55] season
[1:33:56] of the full
[1:33:58] manifestation
[1:34:00] revelation
[1:34:02] of jesus christ
[1:34:04] every power
[1:34:07] that is in god
[1:34:09] is in you
[1:34:11] now people say then why don't we
[1:34:16] there's a lot of little factors that
[1:34:17] come in there
[1:34:20] otherwise as i heard a brother preach
[1:34:22] once
[1:34:23] he said i preached on a sunday morning
[1:34:26] i was driving to work and the traffic
[1:34:28] was backed up and they were cutting me
[1:34:30] off
[1:34:31] and i was just getting more and more
[1:34:33] upset
[1:34:36] and he said i looked over there and my
[1:34:37] son had left his little
[1:34:40] dashboard
[1:34:45] and he said i looked over there and i
[1:34:47] normally as annoyed by that and i picked
[1:34:49] that thing up and had it in my lap
[1:34:52] and a car cut me off
[1:34:55] and i pushed the button and two missiles
[1:34:57] went out
[1:34:58] and i heard boom and they were gone
[1:35:02] and then something spoke to me and says
[1:35:05] and that's what you would be
[1:35:08] if i
[1:35:09] wasn't in you
[1:35:14] hallelujah i was like preach it brother
[1:35:16] [Laughter]
[1:35:17] and i don't even go on the freeway very
[1:35:19] often
[1:35:22] it's not me that doeth the works as my
[1:35:24] father dwelleth in me he doeth the works
[1:35:26] and when he met the devil he had every
[1:35:27] power that god's got was right in him
[1:35:29] but he never used
[1:35:31] one of them
[1:35:33] you talk about what's going to happen
[1:35:34] saints god's put power in you
[1:35:36] god's given authority to you
[1:35:39] amen you understand what i mean about
[1:35:40] power in you amen power to withstand
[1:35:44] an authority
[1:35:45] but god's working in us a character
[1:35:57] but he never used one of them
[1:36:00] he said satan said if that question mark
[1:36:03] the word of god's right if thou be the
[1:36:05] son of god
[1:36:06] do a miracle
[1:36:08] let me see you do a miracle hmm he still
[1:36:11] says the same thing
[1:36:13] right
[1:36:14] people talked about injuring that man
[1:36:16] wasn't that in eustis texas will hurt
[1:36:19] this little girl
[1:36:20] you healer
[1:36:24] same devil
[1:36:26] same devil
[1:36:28] they need you to prove god i'm sorry
[1:36:31] i've already proved god
[1:36:32] i'm proving god by my life day by day i
[1:36:35] don't need to perform some sign
[1:36:39] he still says the same thing if thou be
[1:36:41] the son of god command these stones to
[1:36:42] be turned to bread and eat because
[1:36:44] you're hungry you have need of it see
[1:36:47] and jesus
[1:36:49] said never said
[1:36:50] now i have power to overcome you
[1:36:53] see
[1:36:54] never said it
[1:36:55] he said
[1:36:57] it's written
[1:36:59] full submission saints to the word of
[1:37:02] god leads us to the place our final
[1:37:04] defense is not ourself
[1:37:07] it's right here
[1:37:09] in the word
[1:37:11] amen
[1:37:13] amen it's written man shall not live by
[1:37:15] bread alone the father's word see but by
[1:37:17] every word that proceedeth out of the
[1:37:19] mouth of god satan took him up to the
[1:37:21] pinnacle and said if thou be the son of
[1:37:23] god jesus said it is written he take him
[1:37:25] up onto a mountain showed him all the
[1:37:28] kingdoms of the world united states and
[1:37:31] all
[1:37:32] oh man i mean why couldn't he named i
[1:37:34] say this tongue-in-cheek why couldn't he
[1:37:36] have named russia
[1:37:39] why couldn't he name china
[1:37:44] i hope you catch the humor of that
[1:37:49] but he's preaching a message as it is to
[1:37:52] us right here
[1:37:54] they're all mine jesus know that they
[1:37:56] were his see brother brown doesn't
[1:37:58] change us around say oh now explain this
[1:38:00] all how this can be no no they were the
[1:38:03] devils this right now my brother and
[1:38:05] sister is the devil and we've got
[1:38:07] satan's ambassadors working all over the
[1:38:09] place to fulfill satan's
[1:38:14] will said i do with him whatever i want
[1:38:17] to
[1:38:18] you can see what he's doing with him
[1:38:20] just whatever he wants to see we see
[1:38:21] that right now coming to pass he said
[1:38:24] they're mine and i give them everyone to
[1:38:26] you if you fall down and worship me
[1:38:28] jesus knew in the millennium
[1:38:31] he was going to fall heir to it anyhow
[1:38:34] so he said it is written i shall worship
[1:38:36] the lord thy god and him only so thou
[1:38:38] serve get thee hints satan is that right
[1:38:41] he defeated satan
[1:38:44] with
[1:38:45] let me just
[1:38:48] he defeated satan
[1:38:50] with submission
[1:38:53] to the father's word
[1:38:56] you see when we don't
[1:38:58] resort back to emotion
[1:39:01] or
[1:39:02] intellect
[1:39:04] or reasoning
[1:39:07] but we just submit to the word
[1:39:10] amen are you with me tonight saints
[1:39:14] he defeated satan on the father's words
[1:39:17] is that right bringing it to show that
[1:39:19] the weakest this is why i had to read
[1:39:21] this quote
[1:39:23] to show that the weakest of christians
[1:39:25] can defeat satan on thus saith the lord
[1:39:28] out of the word of god no matter what
[1:39:30] you feel what you think
[1:39:33] thus saith the lord it is written now
[1:39:37] look what the bible said jesus said
[1:39:39] whatsoever luke 11 24 whatsoever things
[1:39:42] see how he's now made a loop around
[1:39:45] and this is one thing i loved about this
[1:39:47] because we're coming right back in this
[1:39:48] loop again
[1:39:51] whatsoever things you desire when you
[1:39:53] pray believe you receive it is that
[1:39:55] right
[1:39:56] then it is written isn't it then i pray
[1:39:58] then i ask god to heal me
[1:40:00] i have a legitimate reason i want to
[1:40:02] preach this his gospel i want to live
[1:40:05] for him
[1:40:06] i ask him to heal me then i believe i'm
[1:40:09] healed just go on and act like it and
[1:40:12] god does the work
[1:40:15] that settles it
[1:40:17] it'll do it for you brother it'll do it
[1:40:19] for you sister it'll do it for you it'll
[1:40:21] do it for you it'll do it for you it'll
[1:40:24] do it for every one of you
[1:40:26] amen there's our position saints
[1:40:29] there's the only position we can take
[1:40:32] is that full submission to the word of
[1:40:35] god and once again
[1:40:37] i have my own motives for asking this
[1:40:39] but i just want you
[1:40:41] to make your own declaration
[1:40:43] has god answered your prayers lately
[1:40:46] he has come around
[1:40:48] and he will do it again
[1:40:51] and again
[1:40:52] and again
[1:40:53] and again
[1:40:55] and the devil's over here telling you
[1:40:57] don't ask for that that's to puny don't
[1:41:00] do this don't do that
[1:41:02] he said
[1:41:04] whatever
[1:41:05] you would ask from your heart amen
[1:41:09] let me wrap this around
[1:41:11] we have lifted
[1:41:13] our heart soul
[1:41:15] to the lord jesus christ
[1:41:18] and it's went through the purifying fire
[1:41:21] this is not a carnal heart
[1:41:24] this is not a worldly heart
[1:41:26] this is not a wicked heart
[1:41:30] this is a godly heart
[1:41:33] and whatever you would ask
[1:41:36] from that godly heart
[1:41:38] god hears you
[1:41:40] and he answers that prayer
[1:41:43] sometimes
[1:41:45] a little different
[1:41:47] than our old carnal mind thought it
[1:41:49] would be
[1:41:50] but my god is an answering god
[1:41:54] my god is an awesome god can we say amen
[1:41:56] to that tonight amen sister ruth will
