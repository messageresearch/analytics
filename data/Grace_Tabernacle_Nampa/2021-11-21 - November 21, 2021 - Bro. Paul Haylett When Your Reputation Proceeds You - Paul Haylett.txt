bless each and every one of you here today we just thank the lord for his goodness his kindness to us amen i just want to uh remind everyone that there will be no wednesday service this week and we certainly wish you a happy thanksgiving time together with family just to share truly of the blessings that god has given us with thanksgiving from our hearts and you know my brothers and sisters we can look at the natural life and we can see all the things that god has done for us he's blessed us with with wonderful gifts in the natural life but all of that pales in comparison to what god has done we listen to the prophet as he speaks the god of this evil age and we recognize the overwhelming power that satan is allowed right he doesn't possess that power he's allowed by god to demonstrate this or to bring this forward and to realize my brother and sister we can say well i'm i'm having some tough times in life brother paul i'm having some tough times whoever we might be think what it would be without the blood of jesus christ on us amen we have no comprehension saints of the demonic forces that are moving in the world today you know i say this with a bit of humor but i say this in a seriousness we could have been joe biden of whom the world is demeaning and looking down but yet called and anointed to fulfill a certain portion and we rebel against that in the flesh right but saints you realize the prophet said america would be bankrupt and i don't think it's just going to come up a dollar short there's only going to be one force on the earth that can redeem the united states it's already prophesied it's anointed to happen and we're witnessing it and we say i don't like this but i can tell you this if gasoline is ten dollars a gallon god will still take care of his pride if a loaf of bread is ten dollars god promised to take care of his pride amen these things must come to pass so we can either frown grumble and gripe or we can say lord we are one day closer thank you lord hallelujah amen uh also i want to announce that sister jerry and i are going to be gone the 3rd of december through the 10th um to arizona to hug some grandchildren and maybe our children too but anyway it's mostly about the grandchildren uh anyway so um i haven't really discussed it with brother chris brother david but they will be someone will be covering the services and i thank god for the ministry we have here in the church and uh saints i just have to tell you this you know sometimes confession is good for the soul i i need to give them more opportunity but sometimes when so many things are bubbling up inside of you you just feel oh next service i'll next service i'll but you just have but i thank god for it for the man god has placed in our midst if we would just stand uh today i want to go into i guess the third part of the two sides of obedience and uh i titled this today when your reputation proceeds you and but we're not talking about people we're talking actually about the spirits that's behind it all that moves everything nothing is moved that is moved my brother and sister without a spirit behind it and so we have to understand that now let's just turn in our bible bibles to the book of romans the 16th chapter starting with the 17th verse 17 through 20. just trust that the lord will just open what is upon my heart today on part of this because you see my brother and sister i'm going to type this or like in this spot that i'm in right now um we are the sheep of his pasture is that the word amen so so we are not here to decide what gate to walk through or where we're going to drink or eat from it's all decided for us but bringing that down to a level where a pastor is considered a shepherd over the flock no one wants to sit under a delinquent shepherd in other words if you eat this it's going to kill you yeah i might offend him if i warn him of that if you climb the fence and the coyotes and the wolves are on the outside the fence well maybe they rubbed noses through the fence with one of them and they thought they're not such bad guys and if i warn against that they might think i'm picking on that poor coyote now what kind of delinquent shepherd would let you eat poisonous weeds and associate with wolves and so we do our job and we deal with our complexes so we'll just preach the word of god today and hopefully when it's all done i can deal with the complex and you can handle being told about that wolf that's outside your fence romans 16 17 through 20 now beseech brethren mark them which cause divisions and offenses contrary to the doctrine which you have learned and avoid them for they that are such serve not our lord jesus christ but their own belly and by good words and fair speeches deceive the hearts of the simple for your obedience has come abroad unto all men and i am glad therefore on your behalf but yet i would have you wise unto that which is good and simple concerning evil oh i love this 20th verse hallelujah and the god of peace shall bruise satan under whose feet your feet shortly the grace of our lord jesus christ be with you amen heavenly father we just asked lord even as our brother already prayed father bind any words that are not your words lord father we just want to draw close lord as individuals as families as a body of believers we want to draw right into your presence that all the world can see is us in you and you in us father we thank you for the opportunity to come today ask for your guidance in the name of jesus christ amen you may be seated now kind of jumping ahead of myself but i feel right now just to say this saints we look at these four verses and we'll realize that they are evenly divided between the two sides i think god plays fair doesn't he although i think if you got the holy ghost the devil's going to think you have an unfair advantage but in this we'll see the apostle paul has laid out these scriptures now let's look at the apostle paul for a moment here the apostle paul's popularity and you say whoa now popularity yes popularity means support in other words those that said amen to the word that paul preached those that stood behind it and actually you know the greatest compliment you can pay pay the profit today people are identifying and things will and saints you know sometimes it might sound like i'm down on this please don't misunderstand me you're not paying a compliment to the prophet by hanging a three by six picture of him in your living room wall that's right that's right you are paying a compliment to the prophet by obeying living and testifying of the message he brought anyone can hang that picture on their wall but it takes someone who has sold out to the word to live that word out i say let's be complimentary to the prophet let's lift him up as a man as a servant of god let's lift him up and as i said i firmly believe that with all of my heart or i would not have spoken my brother and sister so what we want to do is is do this and realize that that the support uh the base of of uh the apostle paul's popularity and you can find this in various you know how dictionaries have slightly different words but by supporting these people supported the apostle paul and when paul would come into a city and he would start to preach if nothing had ever happened in that city my brother and sister we would maybe be suspicious that that it would be a circumstance or maybe not effective for the day but you see the word of god was not paul's word it was god's word brought through paul and so there was a support that come and my brother and sister i hope you follow my words right now his popularity amongst the real believers was based on his stand for the word you see there was something that resonated in his heart and i believe that you can say amen this morning something resonates in the heart amen that's the truth there's life here and i want this life and the apostle paul was preaching and you know he wasn't always so kind my brother and sister but he was vindicated in the work that he was called in his age and we'll find that as we look into the work that paul had for the age that he was in that it was not a work that come to the end of an age and stopped but it come forth and as it were gathered with the word for every age come together into a giant my brother and sister i i don't know how to maybe put the right word to it but into a giant uh a a force that had come into the laodicean age and it was here that we can look and uh look into the book of romans if you would we can do this all through the new testament but when we read the book of romans we see how closely it resembles the day we live in the church in disarray many voices people doing things they shouldn't do illicit affairs and all kinds of nonsense taking place and still claimed under the name of jesus christ under the name of god and so we see such a very close parallel to the day that we live in and and we see how the behavior of the people and the spirits of the day are are is in such a a unity as it would with the spirits of this day that we just recognize that we can take these words of the apostle paul and we don't have to modify we don't have to reason it we don't have to you know double check it as it were we recognize this is the truth this is the word and it applies to me and it applies to the day that i live in amen so you see uh paul has some strong words for the people i kind of wonder sometimes i know i say this once in a while here in the church but i wonder sometimes if the message church of our age could truly handle an apostle paul in their midst if they would declare him maybe just a little too radical think about it but you see my brother and sister the apostle paul with the message for his day had just as much zeal as any man that's ever come to the face of the earth just as much desire to see the word of god effective in you and i as any man on the face of the earth you see we're not here to place one messenger above another now we recognize that god did set things in order let me just sidetrack for a moment can i do that amen now god chose brother branham to be the prophet to this age there was purpose behind that it was not as though they just put numbers in a bucket or something and then drew out a number and said okay you're going to be to this age or that age you see god knew what he was doing and the same token saints the reason you weren't setting under paul's ministry is because god had made you in such a fashion to be here to represent seven ages worth of ministry you have the ability the facet in you to take that and pull the word in and say amen to it and respond to that is it easy it's not a trick question saints no one said it would be easy but the word said you would do it that's all that matters give us a mountain to climb give us a valley to go through give us great trials fiery trials god didn't say now you know if this is too much for you i have a shortcut but he did say he would bear us up come on think about it i'm a failure i'm a failure i just i failed again at the same thing that i failed then and then and then but the word of god comes to bear us up so much so that satan tried to use that against our lord jesus if you throw yourself from the peak of the temple will his angels not come and bear you up lest you would dash your foot against the stone and jesus said ha that's not the word says we'll not tempt the lord look at the day we're living in my brother and sister the parallels all the little things placed through the word that is here for you and i as a resource as a resource that we can reach in that and say you know what lord i believe that and i will act upon that so we see that paul had some strong words for the people and you know it's interesting saints the ones aligned to the word had or have no problem with the word and that's amazing when one is in unity with the word we don't have any problem with the word it's we don't have to say well i don't believe that's what god meant i i don't believe that applied to us i don't believe that says we have this and we have that no when one is in agreement with the word when the word comes you might say ouch or oh me but you'll also say amen and so we look through the ages what has happened and when paul was preaching these very strong words to his day did the whole church desert him and he just ended up preaching as it were to an empty building or an empty courtyard no my brother and sister in every age they're sons and daughters of god just like you want to be glorious to get on that other side and meet them we're going to be looking there and i just say this because it's how it touches my heart we'll be looking there and thinking oh my you were there in that day how did you do it and they'll be on the flip side looking at you saying you were there laodicea how did you do it and we'll both at the same time be able to speak it was christ in me it wasn't me it was him that did this it was him that held me up hallelujah because if it was not so saints we'd get to heaven and they'd have to make a shrine for those who overcome laodicea because we were the best of the best does that fit the word no sir because it's not about you and i it's all about him it's all about what he had chose to do but yet he did make you a special person to be able to stand in laodicea never forget that you see others had issues with paul and when people had issues with paul because paul was standing on the word i hope you catch the saints this applies to our day very very relevant they had issues with paul but paul clearly stood on the word can we find anywhere through history where they have proven that paul was off of the word not one drop of evidence that paul ever departed from the word that issue with paul you know what that really says they didn't have an issue with paul they had an issue with the word amen so when they push back it really paul was the target paul was the face just as though this day you are the target and you are the face but they're not pushing against you they're pushing against the word see how the spirits have come they've changed their clothing they've changed their mask as it were right brother branham preaching about god in morphe it's the same god changing a mass well my brother and sister satan said oh look at that god just changed his mask it works i'll change my mask i'll go from a devil with a pitchfork to a priest i'll go from a drunk to a religious scholar i'll go from the disrespectable to the respectable just changing his mask so we realized as paul stood on the word the issue was really with the word um my here again i've got to stop doing this i'm trying to but when you leave a book in the truck in this room in that room you pick something up and you read a little bit and i'm sorry i can't even tell you what message this was in but the prophet of god speaking along these lines that it is here in this day that we become the manifestation he's talking about god in flesh sister jerry's been you know gets excited shares a little something with me but you see god said i've got a lot of ways to reveal myself in this last day i can reveal myself as melchizedek he did i can reveal myself in a cloud i can reveal myself in fire i can reveal myself here and i can reveal myself there but what i'm going to do is come down in this last day and i'm going to reveal myself in my flesh the bride wow you talk about ownership saints god's not setting back saying well i hope there's some people he's already holds the title deed to you satan's there trying to convince you to revoke god's right to your life and satan will do everything he can to convince you that your life is not your own what is he doing it's plagiarizing the word of god your life is not your own i have it but jesus christ already declared your life is not your own i have it you see how satan's such a bluff that he is coming in such a fashion now i want to go back to verse 17. now i beseech you my brother and sister the word beseech is to ask urgently or fervently so he's there declaring fervently i i now beseech you or ask you fervently brother take out the trash no sir this was a much deeper subject he was he was reaching out now my brother and sister some of you are going to think that i'm just hashing something here today but i can tell you honestly not because the last half of these verses are actually what drew me to this scripture but i felt led of the lord hope you don't mind he said i beseech you brethren mark them which cause division and offenses contrary to the doctrine which you have learned and avoid them you know we have this great movement around the message we need unity we need unity the prophet of god talked about unity that would come in the last day but my brother and sister we look at this and we see that paul is asking the brethren there to the church there that that i'm asking you fervently to mark them now my brother and sister to mark them does not mean that we publicize to the whole world what rotten people they are or we demean them or we do everything to cut down we do that wrong spirit my brother and sister wrong attitude when that is the prophet of god taught us that it is prayer that changes things amen so that should be our avenue for a solution to the problems but he said mark them or identify them that uh these that are they're bringing a division now my brother and sister we don't even need to go to webster to know what a division is there is a separation or a setting apart a wedge and so paul is declaring you know what you need to identify those that are bringing these differences and divisions and wedges into the church and bringing offenses and offenses in this my brother and sister is a word speaking and such as to disregard one's standard or belief so coming in and breaking down what it is as it were a group of people holding to a standard of the word and one would come and to break that and cause a division in that the apostle paul says markham you know we do in this day we just say oh it's a difference of opinion they have the right that's the way they understand the message now this might come a little blunt to you i'm sorry it does but you see my brother and sister the apostle paul if we believe him said we should identify this is one who brings division this is not one who comes in and brings unity into the church this is not the one who says now i might see the word a little different than you do but what we're going to do is just pray that god gives us all the correct revelation that we all know these are spirits that come in they want to divide this my brother and sister let me just put it this way any time you've ever seen sheep inside the pasture the coyote does not run and dive into the middle of the herd hoping he comes out with a sheep a coyote pardon me sister sue starts moving this sheep look do you see what's happening you'll be safer over here behind the sagebrush where i can eat you in peace so what happens is it starts to bring separation now i'm not here and as i said i'm i'm not grinding any access saints lord laid this on my heart then as i looked at this i thought oh i'll just start here for
