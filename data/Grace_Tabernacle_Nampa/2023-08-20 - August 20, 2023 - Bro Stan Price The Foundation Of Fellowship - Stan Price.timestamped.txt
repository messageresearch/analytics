[37:22] way we sing it
[37:24] but I want to share testimony
[37:27] my daughter my oldest daughter had
[37:30] epilepsy for
[37:32] gosh I don't know probably 15 years
[37:34] maybe
[37:36] and I always struggled with that we
[37:40] would pray for her and and it seemed
[37:42] like that she would go for for several
[37:44] months and uh and one time I think she
[37:47] went for for quite a distance of time
[37:50] but then she would have another seizure
[37:51] and down in Florida how the law is I
[37:55] don't know how it is here but
[37:57] you have to be even if you're on
[37:59] medication you have to be seizure free
[38:01] for six months
[38:02] or what you can't drive she had little
[38:04] kids she would always have to depend on
[38:06] somebody to take her to the grocery
[38:07] store and so
[38:09] and so uh
[38:11] she had uh she had a seizure one time
[38:14] when she was out jogging or walking or
[38:17] something fell into a ditch and if there
[38:19] hadn't been somebody driving by at the
[38:21] time to see her you know we don't know
[38:22] what might have happened so
[38:24] herner husband had bought this German
[38:27] Shepherd and they got this idea that
[38:29] they were going to train this German
[38:30] Shepherd to be a service dog for her
[38:33] everywhere she went that dog was going
[38:34] to have to go it was Tethered to her I
[38:37] was telling brother Paul he wouldn't let
[38:39] her bring it to church but but she took
[38:42] it everywhere else I mean all our family
[38:43] gatherings you know when came Amy and
[38:45] Daniel and there was that dog
[38:48] and so and so she kind of struggled with
[38:51] it I kind of struggled with it for sure
[38:54] and so she said that that she kept
[38:56] putting fleeces before the Lord and and
[38:59] and and and it seemed like it kept being
[39:02] that she needed to keep that dog
[39:04] and uh and so she was in she was in
[39:07] Saint Augustine last year uh and brother
[39:10] Andrew Glover was preaching uh a Revival
[39:13] over the over the the weekend there
[39:16] Friday Saturday and Sunday and she had
[39:18] she said I'm going to put one more
[39:20] fleece before the Lord about that dog
[39:23] and uh and so she's sitting in service
[39:26] Saturday night and brother Andrew says
[39:29] you don't need a fleece you just need to
[39:32] believe God
[39:35] well she was delivered from epilepsy
[39:39] [Music]
[39:40] [Applause]
[39:44] here's the thing and this is the reason
[39:46] why I was sharing this testimony
[39:49] because that night she sent out a text
[39:51] to her to her mother and I and her
[39:53] sisters and everybody that she knew you
[39:56] know late at night we get this text and
[39:58] she says I have no more epilepsy
[40:02] but she says listen to what she says she
[40:05] says I have no more fear
[40:07] of having a seizure
[40:09] and I thought that's been it all along
[40:12] see that fear was that doorway
[40:15] see the fear and brother Branham defines
[40:18] fear this way he says we're afraid God
[40:20] won't keep his word
[40:23] and so this song has become almost a
[40:26] theme song in our church
[40:28] and so I wanted to sing it I know you
[40:31] all know it probably and we sing it
[40:33] maybe a little different we don't sing
[40:35] the uh
[40:36] I think it's we'll just we'll just sing
[40:39] it you just have to follow us brother
[40:41] Alex
[40:44] I no longer a Slave To Fear
[40:52] oh I am a child of God
[41:00] I'm no longer a
[41:04] Slave To Fear
[41:09] oh I am a child
[41:13] of God
[41:17] you unravel me
[41:21] with a melody
[41:25] you surround me with
[41:30] a song
[41:33] of Deliverance
[41:37] from my enemy
[41:42] till all my
[41:46] fears are gone
[41:49] well I'm no longer a Slave To Fear
[41:58] oh I
[42:01] am the child of God
[42:06] I'm no longer a Slave to fear
[42:15] for I am a child of God
[42:22] from my mother's womb
[42:27] you have chosen me

[42:55] well I'm no longer a Slave To Fear
[43:02] [Music]
[43:03] oh I am a child of God
[43:11] I'm no longer a Slave To Fear
[43:20] oh I am a child of God the bridge
[43:27] brother
[43:29] you split the sea so I could walk right
[43:35] through it
[43:37] my fears were drowned in perfect life
[43:45] to rescue
[43:47] rest so I could stand and say
[43:52] I am a child of God
[44:01] who rescued me so I could stand and say
[44:07] I am
[44:10] a child of God
[44:15] oh I am
[44:17] a child of God
[44:23] I am a child of God
[44:32] amen
[44:33] [Music]
[44:37] [Applause]
[44:42] let's stand and turn in our Bibles
[44:46] started Hebrews the seventh chapter
[44:49] and then we'll read a scripture and and
[44:51] uh
[44:52] Revelations the fifth chapter
[44:56] Hebrews the seventh chapter
[45:00] beginning at the first verse it says for
[45:03] this Melchizedek
[45:04] king of Salem priest of the most high
[45:07] God
[45:08] who met Abraham returning from the
[45:10] slaughter of the Kings and blessed him
[45:11] to whom also Abraham gave a tenth part
[45:14] of all first being by interpretation
[45:16] king of righteousness which is what the
[45:20] word Melchizedek means it means king of
[45:22] righteousness and after that also king
[45:24] of Salem which is king of peace without
[45:27] father without mother
[45:29] without dissent
[45:31] having neither beginning of days nor end
[45:33] of life but made like unto the Son of
[45:35] God abideth a priest continually a
[45:39] brightest a priests continually
[45:41] Revelations the fifth chapter
[45:43] a familiar
[45:45] scripture I believe to all of us
[45:48] Revelations 5 will begin reading at
[45:51] verse 8.
[45:52] and when he had taken the book The Four
[45:54] beasts and Four and Twenty Elders fell
[45:56] down before the lamb having every one of
[45:58] them Harps and golden vials full of
[46:00] odors which are the prayers of the
[46:02] Saints now watch who is going to be
[46:04] singing this song it's not the 24 Elders
[46:07] the Holy Spirit stopped the meeting and
[46:09] questions and answers on the seals when
[46:11] brother Branham just ran right across
[46:13] this because someone asked him is this
[46:16] the raptured uh Saints and he said no
[46:19] and he and he and then went on to the
[46:21] next question and then it's like is
[46:23] there something wrong here you know with
[46:26] somebody sick you know does somebody
[46:27] need prayer and somebody from the
[46:29] audience hollers out read the scripture
[46:31] again
[46:32] and so he said they because it's the
[46:35] prayers of the Saints
[46:38] they sung that new song saying Thou Art
[46:40] Worthy to take the book and open the
[46:42] seals thereof for that was slain and
[46:45] hath redeemed us to God by thy blood out
[46:47] of every Kindred tongue people and
[46:48] Nations see that's why it can't be the
[46:50] 24 Elders because they're Jewish all 24
[46:53] Elders are Jewish
[46:55] so he says and has Tomatoes Hast made us
[46:58] unto our God Kings and Priests and we
[47:00] shall reign on the earth let's bow our
[47:02] hearts Heavenly Father
[47:05] Lord you have just I just thank you so
[47:09] much that you have brought me to this
[47:11] place here this morning
[47:13] father among this people the the
[47:16] purchase of your blood
[47:18] father and we're just we're just looking
[47:20] forward to just sitting down all of us
[47:22] together and just enjoying the word that
[47:25] you have prepared for us this morning
[47:27] you know every need father and I don't
[47:30] have anything written out to say you
[47:32] know My Heart Lord I choose for you to
[47:35] lead us and to guide us and to and to
[47:38] take us where you want on a little
[47:39] journey this morning just like just like
[47:42] when you reveal yourself to job in the
[47:44] Whirlwind now father you took him on a
[47:47] little journey you showed him your love
[47:49] you showed him that that you cared it
[47:51] wasn't about it wasn't about the
[47:53] Temptation and the trial and it wasn't a
[47:55] result of Joe being a a bad person but
[47:58] it was another way that you were
[48:00] expressing your love to job to bring him
[48:02] a little higher father and you and you
[48:04] proved to him God you said
[48:07] I'm so full of love that I I know when
[48:11] this little this little goat was
[48:13] conceived and and watch it's fixing the
[48:16] bear it's fixing to bring forth birthday
[48:18] and you see this field it's it's no man
[48:21] even touches this but I take care of it
[48:23] and I water it and you were just
[48:24] expressing your love to job in such a
[48:27] way and father it's our heart's desire
[48:29] for you to take us on that same Journey
[48:31] here this morning and into you and and I
[48:35] believe if that happens if we allow it
[48:37] to happen father if we set our thinking
[48:39] aside we will walk out of this place and
[48:42] not be the same people that walk in and
[48:45] that's our hearts desire in Jesus name
[48:47] bless your people we pray amen God bless
[48:50] you you can be seated
[48:55] you know that song the first time I
[48:57] heard it I was at my daughter's Church
[49:00] in Canada and that verse where it says
[49:03] you unravel me
[49:05] you know it because you know I have
[49:09] the same as I have a lot of favorite
[49:11] scriptures but I have one that rises
[49:13] above all of them which I shared with
[49:15] you last night but I I mean I have a lot
[49:18] of favorite quotes I have quotes all
[49:20] taped in my Bible
[49:22] but there's a quote that that has meant
[49:25] more to me probably than any other quote
[49:27] and that's when brother Branham is
[49:29] is about to preach the token message
[49:31] which he said this is the most important
[49:33] message outside of the seals this is the
[49:36] most important message that I've ever
[49:38] preached
[49:39] and he said he said right in the
[49:41] beginning before he'd even started
[49:43] talking he says
[49:45] I had to unfold myself amen amen and
[49:48] live among it before I could say these
[49:50] things
[49:51] see we have to unfold ourselves and and
[49:54] what that mean what that meant to
[49:56] brother Branham I don't know but what it
[49:57] means to me is I have to just unfold all
[50:00] of my thoughts and all my ideas and I
[50:03] have to be prepared to live among this
[50:06] word and when I can experience that word
[50:10] without my human thinking involved
[50:12] that's when I can share it amen amen and
[50:15] that's and you know Jesus said the words
[50:17] that I speak or spirit in their life
[50:20] your words if you're just going to quote
[50:22] the prophet
[50:23] that's not your that's not his words
[50:27] right I mean people quote the prophet
[50:30] the same as the denominations quote the
[50:31] church quote the Bible
[50:34] but it's when the source of that yeah is
[50:38] him then it contains his life and it'll
[50:41] do amazing amazing things and so we just
[50:45] submit ourselves to him that's what we
[50:48] this is what we do I want to call this
[50:50] message this morning I want to call it I
[50:53] thought about well I might call it the
[50:55] Melchizedek the priest but that really I
[50:57] mean that's what we're talking about but
[50:59] I want to call this the foundation of
[51:00] Fellowship
[51:02] the foundation of Fellowship you know
[51:05] there's three things
[51:07] that that we talk a lot about
[51:09] and and one of them is love all right we
[51:12] talk about God's love
[51:14] but do we really understand God's love
[51:16] because God's love is a person
[51:18] okay and I'm and I'm thinking
[51:21] I'm thinking well I'll use one of
[51:22] brother branham's uh illustrations he
[51:24] said there was this woman that
[51:26] that uh their house caught on fire and
[51:29] and she was out hanging clothes on the
[51:32] line and and the baby was in the second
[51:33] floor you know you remember the story
[51:35] where she was horribly disfigured and so
[51:38] she runs into that house through the
[51:41] fire because she wrapped herself in one
[51:43] of those blankets and then when she
[51:45] picks up the baby she realized she
[51:48] doesn't have enough blanket to cover
[51:49] both of them so she wraps that baby she
[51:52] runs out of that house she's burnt up
[51:53] terribly she looks horribly disfigured
[51:57] can you say that she doesn't love
[52:01] but the Bible says that those that love
[52:04] are born of God can you say that she's
[52:06] born of God because she did that
[52:08] no you can't so maybe the love of God is
[52:11] something different and something
[52:13] greater
[52:15] see and that's the way that's the way I
[52:17] look at at Fellowship because Fellowship
[52:21] is you know I've I've I've been through
[52:24] I've been in around the message for many
[52:27] years and you then you get together with
[52:30] somebody and you talk about the football
[52:32] game or whatever you know I mean or talk
[52:34] about the food that you were eating or
[52:36] the clothes that you're wearing or what
[52:38] you did and everything and then you come
[52:40] away
[52:40] man that was Great Fellowship
[52:43] there's no Fellowship there
[52:45] that wasn't Fellowship amen and then you
[52:48] can even come together and sometimes
[52:50] talk about the word and it's still not
[52:52] really Fellowship
[52:54] because Fellowship is a blending
[52:56] together it's it's when it's when
[53:00] I don't know maybe it's when I can start
[53:03] a sentence and you can finish it
[53:05] you know because we're so Blended
[53:07] together and that's what happens see the
[53:09] devil you know I don't know how you view
[53:11] the pandemic but I saw it as an absolute
[53:14] assault on the bride of Christ
[53:16] because he doesn't care about these
[53:18] people out here he's already got them
[53:19] but what he was trying to do is he was
[53:22] trying to keep this body from coming
[53:24] together he was doing everything he
[53:27] could to to destroy the fellowship in
[53:31] this bride
[53:32] and I know and I'm not this is just how
[53:35] I handled it as a as a minister we
[53:38] continued having church because we were
[53:40] in Florida our governor said we need to
[53:43] be in church that's what he said I heard
[53:44] his words he said we need to be in
[53:46] church right now and so most of the
[53:48] churches shut down
[53:50] but uh but we kept on going and so I
[53:53] Remember December well it was that it
[53:56] was it was it was right before that was
[53:58] right at right after Christmas I think
[54:00] it was Christmas on was on a Friday and
[54:02] and then and then there was Saturday and
[54:05] Sunday morning I was to preach
[54:07] and uh
[54:08] and I I woke up Saturday morning I had a
[54:11] terrible fever you know high fever and
[54:13] then and like all of my deacons had
[54:16] covet
[54:17] you know several people in the church
[54:19] had coveted and so I was on this this
[54:22] little chat thing that Barry Coffey had
[54:24] set up and he just put my name in there
[54:26] so I was part of part of this and so it
[54:29] was like 80 ministers or 100 ministers
[54:31] from around the world so I went on this
[54:33] and I said Brothers I need prayer I'd
[54:35] like prayer
[54:36] because
[54:38] you know I haven't been tested but I got
[54:40] a high fever and everything and I've got
[54:41] to go to the pulpit tomorrow because I
[54:43] don't have anybody to take my place
[54:45] and so you know they agreed and
[54:47] everything and so so I got this i got
[54:50] this message from a brother that was on
[54:52] there
[54:53] and he said he said brother he said if
[54:56] if your deacons have got coveted you got
[54:58] covered
[55:00] and he said you need to reconsider
[55:01] having an in-person service tomorrow
[55:05] and I said brother it meant and it
[55:07] really meant a lot to me
[55:08] but I I said brother I said
[55:12] the early church every time that they
[55:15] came together there was a chance they
[55:16] might not survive
[55:19] and I said so what they got in this
[55:23] coming together was more important than
[55:25] their own life
[55:28] and so I said that's the kind of church
[55:31] that I have
[55:32] there's people that didn't come and and
[55:35] for their own reasons or whatever but
[55:37] there was a group that said if if you're
[55:39] having Church we're going to be there
[55:41] and so we kept on having Church you know
[55:43] through the whole thing no no fear
[55:47] I mean I stood right In a Pulpit and
[55:48] said Cove would come and get me
[55:50] you know if you can get past now the
[55:52] token I know Brothers I know I know
[55:54] ministers that passed away I know
[55:57] Minister's wives that passed away from
[55:59] covid so you can't say the covet's going
[56:02] to keep or the the token's going to keep
[56:03] me from dying but the token is going to
[56:06] keep anything that's not God's Will from
[56:08] happening to you
[56:10] and so there was there was no fear
[56:13] of that but anyway this Fellowship is is
[56:16] you go back to the to the very beginning
[56:20] okay and that's and and that's what I
[56:22] like to do because because that's really
[56:24] what this message has taken us back to
[56:26] is the beginning
[56:28] and if we can see the beginning we know
[56:30] that we know that we know the end we
[56:32] know the whole thing because there's
[56:33] God's plan right there
[56:35] and so I think I mentioned last night
[56:37] that you know that that Adam was created
[56:39] in theophany form
[56:41] right God made him in his own image God
[56:44] was logos he was he was now God didn't
[56:46] didn't make Adam the logos
[56:50] but as far as his condition he was the
[56:53] same he was theophany he was a spirit
[56:55] man
[56:57] that could respond to the word
[56:59] see and so so then God put that into
[57:03] human flesh
[57:04] and that's the Nate that's the way that
[57:08] God would come and walk without him
[57:11] they heard the voice of God walking in
[57:13] the garden and so whatever form that was
[57:16] that God was in he interacted with Adam
[57:19] because Adam had access to something he
[57:22] had access to his own soul he had access
[57:25] that was Adam's own control tower that's
[57:28] right and he would blend with with God
[57:31] they would walk together and that was
[57:33] what maintained Adam's life that was the
[57:36] Tree of Life the the perspective that
[57:39] Adam could eat one time from that tree
[57:41] and and live forever is not right
[57:43] because Adam's life is not the life of
[57:47] almighty God it's not a self-sustaining
[57:49] life
[57:51] it is a is I could say that it was a
[57:54] Perpetual life Adam had to have that
[57:56] relationship with God in order to
[57:59] continue walking okay and so so when
[58:03] Adam fell he was cut off from that
[58:07] right he didn't have access he didn't
[58:09] lose his soul
[58:11] but God said the day that you eat
[58:13] thereof that day that you die because he
[58:17] did he'd lost access to that and he and
[58:20] he began by choice because that's how
[58:24] Satan had tempted them he began by
[58:26] choice to go by his own human thinking
[58:29] that's it right and in fact in fact
[58:31] here's how I illustrate it because when
[58:34] God when God came down and he said Adam
[58:37] Adam where are you
[58:39] all right here's the god that created
[58:40] everything that knew everything that
[58:43] stands out he knows everything that's
[58:45] going on but he's challenging Adam
[58:47] because he's saying where is that part
[58:50] of you that I fellowship with what have
[58:53] you done to that
[58:55] and so it then it became an uh uh a
[58:59] dealing with Adam in a human way
[59:01] through his mind
[59:03] see
[59:04] but that thing and and here's where
[59:06] here's where I kind of bring Melchizedek
[59:09] into this because it's just one of my
[59:12] ways that I kind of look
[59:14] that's why I like Brother David and I I
[59:16] think I get a we get along because we're
[59:17] like out of the box kind of guys
[59:20] you know I mean that's just you know
[59:22] when you hear us preachers no telling
[59:24] what's going to come out you know it's
[59:27] maybe some kind of Oddball angle but but
[59:30] now listen
[59:31] if you ran it if you run the genealogy
[59:34] you run to chronology here's a reason
[59:36] that it's in the scripture it's not the
[59:38] Boris to put it to sleep whenever we're
[59:40] reading it and so you see Adam was you
[59:43] know in you know Adam lived so many
[59:45] years and and he began sons and
[59:47] daughters and then he died and so forth
[59:49] it goes on down and you'll find that
[59:52] Adam there's very little separation
[59:54] between Adam and Noah
[59:57] now think about Adam think about Adam
[59:59] and Eve they were the only people on the
[1:00:02] planet that knew what they fell from
[1:00:07] and so and so they're like when when
[1:00:10] Abel or when Seth would bring up his
[1:00:12] offering and and and Adam would say man
[1:00:15] you know you get some Joy or or a little
[1:00:18] place of Fellowship out of bringing this
[1:00:19] offering it is nothing
[1:00:21] compared to what it was
[1:00:23] when God would come down and walk with
[1:00:25] us
[1:00:26] in the cool of the day and blend with us
[1:00:29] and and love us and take care of us
[1:00:32] and so this went this this is my kind of
[1:00:34] little out of the box kind of thinking
[1:00:36] this Adam shared this story
[1:00:39] you know I can see them sitting sitting
[1:00:41] around the campfire with his 800
[1:00:43] grandchildren and telling them about
[1:00:46] this you know I mean about all of this
[1:00:48] that that happened to them well these
[1:00:51] these stories went on down well did you
[1:00:53] know that Noah lived all the way into
[1:00:57] the time of Abraham Noah and Abraham
[1:01:00] were were lived the same amount of time
[1:01:02] I mean they were they live they were
[1:01:04] alive together
[1:01:06] and so I would imagine
[1:01:08] that Noah related this story to Abraham
[1:01:12] about this great place of fellowship and
[1:01:16] so Abraham's like man that would be so
[1:01:18] great to have that
[1:01:21] well
[1:01:23] in Genesis to what is it the 15th
[1:01:25] chapter I think it is and Melchizedek
[1:01:28] came out
[1:01:29] and served Abraham communion
[1:01:31] now I want you to think about something
[1:01:34] disappearing of Melchizedek to Abraham
[1:01:37] had nothing to do with sin
[1:01:40] all right Abraham didn't have to bring
[1:01:42] an offering
[1:01:43] he didn't have to bow down before
[1:01:45] Melchizedek Melchizedek came and met him
[1:01:48] and he served in communion
[1:01:50] and when he served him communion Abraham
[1:01:53] said
[1:01:54] this is what Adam was talking about
[1:01:58] this is this place of Fellowship that
[1:02:01] Adam was talking about and he said you
[1:02:03] must be the same one that walked with
[1:02:06] Adam so here's my tithe here's here's
[1:02:09] everything I'm giving you everything and
[1:02:12] the Bible says in Hebrews the 11th
[1:02:14] chapter now here's where here's this is
[1:02:16] really interesting because Hebrews 11
[1:02:18] chapter says that Abraham looked for a
[1:02:21] city
[1:02:23] which have foundations he wasn't looking
[1:02:25] for just any city was looking for a
[1:02:27] specific City
[1:02:28] which hath foundations whose Builder and
[1:02:31] maker is God find that anywhere in the
[1:02:34] Old Testament
[1:02:35] it's not there
[1:02:37] it's not there
[1:02:38] and Paul didn't explain it
[1:02:41] but the prophet did
[1:02:43] yeah because he said the reason that
[1:02:45] Abraham looked for that city is because
[1:02:47] he had met the king of that City
[1:02:51] but watch what happened with this with
[1:02:54] this communion
[1:02:56] Abraham wasn't just looking for any City
[1:02:59] he was looking for a city which housed
[1:03:01] foundations because that was where he
[1:03:04] was
[1:03:05] amen see the walls the the foundations
[1:03:09] the apostles you know the the Abraham
[1:03:12] and the the Patriarchs the gates of the
[1:03:14] city everything he's part of that City
[1:03:16] so in this communion
[1:03:19] in this communion that Abraham enjoyed
[1:03:21] with Melchizedek was revealed Abraham's
[1:03:26] own election
[1:03:28] and so that is what opened the door for
[1:03:31] Abraham to be the the father of our
[1:03:34] faith I mean the Royal seed
[1:03:37] and so this this this scripture we read
[1:03:39] here you know it's really interesting
[1:03:41] because
[1:03:43] you know brother Brandon speaks of and
[1:03:45] who is this Melchizedek he talks about
[1:03:46] Melchizedek to paraphrase he talks about
[1:03:49] Melchizedek being one of the Mysteries
[1:03:51] revealed under the seals
[1:03:53] and yet he preached Melchizedek the
[1:03:55] great prince in 1955.
[1:03:57] before the seals open
[1:04:00] so there's a way that you can look at it
[1:04:03] and you could say okay
[1:04:05] Melchizedek is God no question about it
[1:04:07] you know theologians there's Jews that
[1:04:10] believed that Melchizedek was Shem
[1:04:13] they that's what they believe but we
[1:04:16] know Melchizedek was God because it says
[1:04:19] without father without mother without
[1:04:21] beginning of days without ending of Life
[1:04:23] he's identified king of righteousness
[1:04:26] king of Peace king of Salem king of
[1:04:28] Jerusalem
[1:04:30] you know and and and so from this
[1:04:32] perspective you can say and the prophet
[1:04:34] comes out and preaches in 1955 that this
[1:04:36] is God
[1:04:38] but see after the opening of the seals
[1:04:42] when we sing a new song and the
[1:04:44] prophet's involved in that yeah
[1:04:46] when we sing a new song and it says thou
[1:04:49] has made us unto our God Kings and
[1:04:51] Priests well Melchizedek is the only one
[1:04:53] that's identified in the Bible as being
[1:04:55] a king and a priest
[1:04:57] until Revelations 5 and verse 10.
[1:05:02] and it
[1:05:04] it includes us now
[1:05:06] see so whatever Melchizedek was is now
[1:05:10] revealed in the bride
[1:05:13] and that's why brother Branham comes out
[1:05:15] in 1965 10 years later and says who was
[1:05:18] this milk
[1:05:21] something that was revealed under the
[1:05:23] seals
[1:05:24] because the sales is the Revelation to
[1:05:26] you that's father the prophet said well
[1:05:28] the Revelation it's the revelation of
[1:05:30] Jesus Christ well that's what I said
[1:05:32] the revelation of you you know when when
[1:05:35] sister Jerry's sang that song it made me
[1:05:37] think of that quote you know it's the
[1:05:38] rising of the Sun
[1:05:40] flesh of his flesh bone of his bone
[1:05:43] power of his power she is him
[1:05:45] oh how
[1:05:47] about that okay let's why don't we say
[1:05:48] it
[1:05:49] flesh of his flesh bone of his bone
[1:05:51] Powers power I am him
[1:05:53] [Music]
[1:05:55] I am him
[1:05:57] see it's real easy for us to put it in
[1:05:59] the third person
[1:06:01] but to be able to recognize that that is
[1:06:04] who I am that's what this message is
[1:06:07] meant for that's what is and that's what
[1:06:08] it's saying that's what he's saying
[1:06:10] right here has made us unto our God
[1:06:12] Kings and Priests
[1:06:14] this is not this is not we're going to
[1:06:17] be Kings there's something coming that's
[1:06:20] going to happen we are right now
[1:06:22] Kings and Priests
[1:06:25] and so what does God want to do see this
[1:06:28] ties right back into what we were
[1:06:30] preaching last night about God's rest
[1:06:31] because God's rest is for him to walk
[1:06:34] without him that's
[1:06:36] that was God's rest and and Paul was
[1:06:40] telling us whatever you do don't
[1:06:43] don't not get that
[1:06:46] because when the Holy Spirit there's
[1:06:49] born in you it is going to have the same
[1:06:51] exact desire that God himself has it's
[1:06:55] going to and see that's why and I got
[1:06:57] this quote and I'm just gonna I'm just
[1:06:59] gonna read it uh I didn't know whether I
[1:07:01] would read it or not but this is one I
[1:07:03] don't have in my Bible and I should have
[1:07:05] and I'm I apologize for that but that
[1:07:08] day of Calvary you you know this is
[1:07:09] probably everybody knows exactly where
[1:07:11] I'm going but there's something he says
[1:07:13] here that that I want you to get he says
[1:07:15] on that day on Calvary he says now the
[1:07:17] first thing I want to say is Jesus never
[1:07:19] lived for himself
[1:07:23] so
[1:07:24] how should we be
[1:07:27] if we have that same spirit
[1:07:30] then
[1:07:31] we should live for others so he says he
[1:07:34] never lived for himself his life was
[1:07:36] spent for others that's perfectly
[1:07:38] eternal life
[1:07:39] when you say you go to church and you do
[1:07:41] good things that's fine
[1:07:43] brother Brandon said in the same message
[1:07:45] he says you go when you buy coal for the
[1:07:47] Widow
[1:07:48] or you buy a man a suit that he needs a
[1:07:51] suit
[1:07:51] but if you're doing that because that's
[1:07:53] what you're supposed to do you're a
[1:07:54] hypocrite
[1:07:57] I'll share with Sharon with brother Paul
[1:08:00] did a few years ago there was a there
[1:08:03] was a man
[1:08:04] a kid really teenager whatever went into
[1:08:07] a school and began shooting the school
[1:08:09] up
[1:08:10] killed a bunch of children
[1:08:12] all right did you know you probably read
[1:08:13] it in the newspaper but did you know
[1:08:15] there was a policeman standing outside
[1:08:16] that school
[1:08:18] and he would not go into that school
[1:08:22] because I don't know why he was taken to
[1:08:25] court and he was exonerated for whatever
[1:08:28] reason but he had a reason for not going
[1:08:30] to school but but just for illustration
[1:08:32] purposes I'm going to say he was close
[1:08:35] to retirement
[1:08:37] you know when he didn't want to risk his
[1:08:39] life because you know he'd worked all
[1:08:41] his life and he's fixing to because he
[1:08:42] was an older older man and he's fixing
[1:08:45] to retire man and he's not going to go
[1:08:46] in because these kids are a bunch of you
[1:08:49] know
[1:08:50] whatever
[1:08:51] and so he's not going to risk his life
[1:08:53] saving him but
[1:08:55] if his son had been in that school
[1:08:58] it would be a completely different thing
[1:09:01] and if we do things for others because
[1:09:04] we're supposed to we're just a hireling
[1:09:08] we're just a hireling but if it's
[1:09:10] because this generally this is genuinely
[1:09:14] my creation
[1:09:16] because the god that created this lives
[1:09:18] in me and has the same desire and love
[1:09:21] of this creation than I do then that's
[1:09:23] genuinely
[1:09:25] eternal life because that's God's own
[1:09:27] life but he said when you have when you
[1:09:29] live your life for others you have an
[1:09:31] eternal life or when you live your life
[1:09:33] for yourself
[1:09:35] when you live your life for yourself you
[1:09:37] have an eternal life
[1:09:39] eternal life is living for others it
[1:09:41] proved it when they come in the Lamb of
[1:09:44] God he lived and had eternal life
[1:09:46] because he did not live for himself he'd
[1:09:48] live for others you listen to this you
[1:09:52] receive eternal life by receiving that
[1:09:55] day that's
[1:09:57] so what did we see last night that day
[1:10:00] was a total and complete and finished
[1:10:03] work
[1:10:04] there was nothing else had to be done I
[1:10:07] don't care how I don't care how you look
[1:10:09] at your flesh Christ finished it right
[1:10:12] there
[1:10:13] and so if we will enter into what
[1:10:16] happened on that day that is eternal
[1:10:19] life because our election places us as
[1:10:23] bride of Christ it places us with God's
[1:10:26] Own desire for his creation
[1:10:30] now see that's where we come to to being
[1:10:32] priests see being a king okay you're a
[1:10:36] king you're a ruler all right but you
[1:10:38] know biblically the word ruler means to
[1:10:40] Shepherd
[1:10:42] it means to take care of
[1:10:44] you know it's like I mean years ago
[1:10:47] you're like man you know one of the
[1:10:49] promises of the church age is I'm going
[1:10:51] to rule of nations with a wrought iron I
[1:10:53] can't wait that guy that cut me off in
[1:10:55] traffic man
[1:10:57] I'm fixing to bust him
[1:10:59] you know but see this is a Shepherd this
[1:11:02] is a shepherd's staff
[1:11:04] and you're and you're going however you
[1:11:07] imagine God in the garden That's the Way
[1:11:10] You Are
[1:11:11] that's who you are
[1:11:13] and even we see it over in Revelations
[1:11:16] 22 which we've which we're doing real
[1:11:18] good on time so we're gonna we'll
[1:11:20] probably go there
[1:11:21] but I want you to see that that the word
[1:11:25] priest or priesthood in the Bible if you
[1:11:28] enter if you look in a search engine or
[1:11:31] whatever in the New Testament you'll
[1:11:33] come up with 153 hits
[1:11:37] 153 scriptures that have the word priest
[1:11:39] or priesthood in it
[1:11:41] 114 are those are in the gospels and the
[1:11:45] book of Acts and they deal strictly
[1:11:48] strictly with the priests and the
[1:11:50] Pharisees or the high priest of that
[1:11:52] time or the challenges that Jesus was
[1:11:54] getting so we're not interested in being
[1:11:55] that kind of a priest right and then in
[1:11:59] the book of Hebrews because no other
[1:12:01] place in the Epistles except for the
[1:12:04] book of Hebrews in the book of First
[1:12:06] Peter does the word priest or priesthood
[1:12:08] exist and then and in First Peter I
[1:12:11] think it's two times in the Book of
[1:12:13] Revelations it's three times and all
[1:12:15] five of those occurrences are you
[1:12:18] and then in the book of Hebrews this one
[1:12:21] little book that's 13 chapters long the
[1:12:24] word priest or priesthood exists 34
[1:12:26] times
[1:12:28] so God is is showing us something
[1:12:31] and we think we think okay
[1:12:34] priests to be a priest okay I'm the one
[1:12:37] that administers this this you know the
[1:12:40] sacraments or around no what a priest is
[1:12:43] is he's an administer of the kingdom of
[1:12:46] God
[1:12:48] and so we are administers
[1:12:52] of the kingdom of God
[1:12:55] we are the people that Romans 8 said
[1:12:59] there are the all creation that's Adam
[1:13:03] not just the mountains and the Seas and
[1:13:05] the grass and and all that but Adam is
[1:13:08] crying out looking for the Tree of Life
[1:13:13] and you know they are just as redeemed
[1:13:15] as we are
[1:13:17] but until we take our position they have
[1:13:21] nowhere to come
[1:13:23] right and that's why the prophet said in
[1:13:25] Revelations 5 when he's preaching this
[1:13:27] in the breach he said John wept why did
[1:13:30] John Wayne weep because the prophet said
[1:13:33] that that John wet because if the lamb
[1:13:37] did not claim the book everything was
[1:13:40] lost okay so that means that what has
[1:13:43] happened in this day and I know you'll
[1:13:45] understand how I mean this I'm not
[1:13:46] saying that overshadows the cross but
[1:13:49] the cross happened and yet if the lamb
[1:13:52] doesn't claim that which is perfect
[1:13:53] purchase then creation is lost why is
[1:13:57] creation lost if he doesn't claim this
[1:13:59] because creation has nowhere to come
[1:14:02] back to the Tree of Life unless the
[1:14:05] bride takes her position unless we come
[1:14:08] to a revelation that we are Kings and
[1:14:10] Priests right now not not somewhere in
[1:14:13] the future not when there's a new city
[1:14:16] in fact let's let's just look at
[1:14:18] something real quick before we
[1:14:20] because
[1:14:21] the thing that the thing that
[1:14:24] I'm not going to say fight because it's
[1:14:26] not a fight It's just sometimes we have
[1:14:29] this perspective all right Hallelujah
[1:14:32] I'm saved it's done praise God I'm I'm
[1:14:35] eternally secure I'm never going to be
[1:14:37] lost I'm walking this life and
[1:14:39] one day
[1:14:41] there's a city
[1:14:43] because we see the city coming down in
[1:14:45] Revelations 21 you know we put that on a
[1:14:47] chronology like okay well that City
[1:14:49] doesn't show up till Revelations 21. but
[1:14:53] let's go to Hebrews 12 and see what see
[1:14:55] what Paul says
[1:14:59] because Paul in the Hebrews 12
[1:15:01] is showing the difference
[1:15:03] between Mount Sinai and Mount Zion
[1:15:07] okay and he's explaining something he's
[1:15:09] saying we've not come to Mount Sinai
[1:15:12] we've not come to this place of fear
[1:15:14] we've not come to this place where God
[1:15:16] is a consuming fire necessarily in that
[1:15:19] sense to where if we touch it we're
[1:15:21] going to die we not come to that
[1:15:23] but he says in verse 22
[1:15:26] but you are come to Mount Zion you are
[1:15:29] come
[1:15:32] he says and unto the city of the Living
[1:15:35] God well I thought that the New
[1:15:37] Jerusalem was out here
[1:15:39] you are the New Jerusalem your position
[1:15:43] is New Jerusalem you are the Touchstone
[1:15:47] of of God's whole creation
[1:15:52] right and watch he says to the city of
[1:15:55] the Living God the heavenly Jerusalem to
[1:15:57] an innumerable company of angels to the
[1:15:59] general assembly the church and the
[1:16:01] Church of the firstborn which is written
[1:16:02] in heaven and to God the judge of all
[1:16:05] the spirit of just men made perfect to
[1:16:06] Jesus the mediator of a New Covenant and
[1:16:09] to the blood of sprinkling that speaketh
[1:16:11] better things than that of Abel there
[1:16:13] are eight things here
[1:16:16] eight things that we are come to that
[1:16:18] Paul tells us and it's all tied with our
[1:16:21] election it's all tied to a finished
[1:16:24] Redemption it's all tied to everything
[1:16:26] is over and and and I and I'll tell you
[1:16:29] something very personal to me
[1:16:32] that about a year and a half ago I was
[1:16:34] preaching on this
[1:16:36] and I'm looking at these and I've and
[1:16:38] I've got these things listed out and I'm
[1:16:40] studying and everything and there's part
[1:16:43] of this I just didn't understand
[1:16:46] and so of course the prophet you know
[1:16:48] which is sometimes
[1:16:50] it's more common than not that you find
[1:16:53] a scripture like this you this is
[1:16:55] amazing I know the prophet must
[1:16:56] appreciate on this didn't even touch it
[1:16:58] didn't didn't he quote it
[1:17:00] so in some people's book brother Paul
[1:17:02] we're not allowed to to comment on this
[1:17:05] but not so so I have no you know you
[1:17:08] look what the commentators you know it
[1:17:10] didn't it it didn't ring the bell
[1:17:13] and so I'm like I'm down on my knees and
[1:17:15] I'm Lord I want to what does this mean
[1:17:19] and you know what the Lord spoke to my
[1:17:20] heart said
[1:17:22] what do you see
[1:17:25] you are come to this what do you see
[1:17:27] that's
[1:17:29] the challenge
[1:17:31] what do you see
[1:17:33] it's not what brother Branham saw
[1:17:36] brother Branham saw the right thing but
[1:17:39] if I'm just going to quote what brother
[1:17:40] Branham saw I'm just saying you know
[1:17:43] there was a story years ago
[1:17:46] I heard this you know I mean you take it
[1:17:48] for what it's worth it's just hearsay
[1:17:50] but there was a certain big name in the
[1:17:52] message and he's in a motel room with
[1:17:54] brother Branham
[1:17:55] and and brother Branham sees the pillar
[1:17:58] of fire in that room and he says brother
[1:17:59] so and so I'm not going to name him he
[1:18:01] said brother so and so don't you see
[1:18:03] that Pillar of Fire
[1:18:04] and brother so and so said no but I see
[1:18:08] the one that does
[1:18:10] that's not good enough for me
[1:18:14] it's not good enough for me
[1:18:16] we have got to have a personal
[1:18:19] experience with the pillar of fire and
[1:18:23] with the word of God that's happened in
[1:18:25] this hour and that's what will change us
[1:18:28] okay so so let's go over to Revelations
[1:18:31] 22 we're doing real good here let's go
[1:18:33] to Revelations 22.
[1:18:35] and we'll take this little thought and
[1:18:37] then we're going to go back to Song of
[1:18:38] Solomon
[1:18:39] all right and we know we know just a
[1:18:42] drop back in Revelations 21 it says in
[1:18:45] verse 9 it says There came unto me one
[1:18:47] of the Seven Angels which had the seven
[1:18:49] vials full of the seven last plagues and
[1:18:51] talk with me now who was that angel I
[1:18:53] have my own thoughts
[1:18:54] because he revealed the city the same
[1:18:56] one revealed mystery Babylon so it may
[1:18:58] just be the same one that we know
[1:19:01] but anyway come hither and I will show
[1:19:03] Thee the bride the Lamb's wife and he
[1:19:05] carried me away in the spirit into a
[1:19:07] great and high mountain and showed me a
[1:19:08] great City holy Jerusalem descending
[1:19:11] from God out of heaven so
[1:19:13] the city is the bride
[1:19:16] the city is not the streets and the
[1:19:20] buildings and the walls the city is the
[1:19:23] bride okay and watch what Revelations 22
[1:19:26] said and he showed me a pure River of
[1:19:28] Water of Life clear as Crystal
[1:19:30] proceeding out of the Throne of God and
[1:19:32] of the land so so we can look at it and
[1:19:34] I'm not saying there's not a city
[1:19:36] because you listen to Future home the
[1:19:37] second half of that tape brother
[1:19:39] branham's described in a literal place
[1:19:41] but if we don't catch the spirituality
[1:19:44] of this thing we're never there's never
[1:19:46] going to be a city for us right and so
[1:19:49] he says he saw the a river of the Water
[1:19:52] of Life clearest Crystal proceeding out
[1:19:54] of the Throne of God now where did the
[1:19:55] prophet say the Throne of God is
[1:19:58] in you
[1:20:00] right the Kingdom of Heaven is in you
[1:20:03] right and and and Jesus said in John 7
[1:20:07] 37 that out of your belly
[1:20:11] shall flow rivers of Living Water
[1:20:14] so this is a description of me
[1:20:18] amen and he goes on and he says and in
[1:20:21] the midst of the street of it and on
[1:20:22] either side of the river was there the
[1:20:24] singular the Tree of Life
[1:20:27] there's not 10 there's not two there's
[1:20:30] not a hundred there's not five thousand
[1:20:31] we say well there's you know there's 50
[1:20:34] people here or whatever there's 50 trees
[1:20:35] of life no there's only one tree of life
[1:20:38] many branches one tree
[1:20:41] so everywhere John saw was the
[1:20:45] singular Tree of Life
[1:20:47] which bear 12 manner of fruits yielded
[1:20:50] her fruit every month and the leaves of
[1:20:52] the tree were for the healings of the
[1:20:55] Nations
[1:20:56] all right okay I'm confused now though
[1:21:00] because the leaves of the tree that's
[1:21:01] Divine Fellowship that's the prophet
[1:21:03] said that restoration of the broad tree
[1:21:04] the leaves were divine Fellowship
[1:21:07] amen
[1:21:08] so the leaves of the tree were further
[1:21:10] healing but I'm thinking now
[1:21:13] we're in the new heavens and new earth
[1:21:14] what needs healing
[1:21:17] all right this is important what needs
[1:21:20] what needs healing some searches in the
[1:21:22] message everything brother random said
[1:21:24] and the closest I could find to a
[1:21:26] definition of what what this is or or
[1:21:30] will be or whatever brother bam said
[1:21:33] well these two Nations they used to be
[1:21:35] at war with each other and now they've
[1:21:37] come together
[1:21:39] so there was a healing there
[1:21:41] well I'm not because I believe that
[1:21:45] I'm not just because the prophet said it
[1:21:47] because it's the principle it's the
[1:21:49] truth but yet let's say a million years
[1:21:51] from now
[1:21:53] is is is Egypt and Israel going to be
[1:21:56] coming up and saying oh wait yeah a
[1:21:58] million years ago we used to hate each
[1:22:00] other
[1:22:01] see there's not going to be any memory
[1:22:03] of that
[1:22:05] yeah right there in a whole different
[1:22:06] economy you know all the tears are wiped
[1:22:09] away there's no remembrance of sin
[1:22:12] you know and so and so I'm thinking what
[1:22:15] is this word healing mean
[1:22:17] and if you'll go back to Matthew 24
[1:22:22] and in Matthew 24
[1:22:24] Jesus identifies what's going on right
[1:22:28] here
[1:22:29] because Matthew 24 and we heard brother
[1:22:32] Vitale say it that you know that that
[1:22:34] Matthew 24 is the three questions it's
[1:22:37] the first six seals and the seventh seal
[1:22:40] is Christ he's sitting there you know so
[1:22:42] he was the seventh seal but but then
[1:22:45] after after he opens the first six seals
[1:22:49] it's it's Parables about the coming of
[1:22:52] the Lord and so you have to catch that
[1:22:54] this is about the coming of the Lord and
[1:22:57] he says in verse 44 therefore be also
[1:23:01] ready for in such an hour as you think
[1:23:03] not the son of man cometh who then is a
[1:23:06] faithful and wise servant whom his Lord
[1:23:09] hath made ruler over his household the
[1:23:13] word household here is the same word as
[1:23:15] healing in Revelations 22.
[1:23:18] and so Matthew 24 is dealing with a
[1:23:22] people
[1:23:24] who when he comes are taking care of the
[1:23:28] household of God and that doesn't mean
[1:23:29] you're taking care of your brother
[1:23:30] sitting next to you it means that you
[1:23:33] have the spirit of God and a desire to
[1:23:37] take care of everything you're grieved
[1:23:39] when you see people not just grieve with
[1:23:42] sin but seeing people that are out of
[1:23:44] their position
[1:23:45] because you want to see because you have
[1:23:48] the mind of Christ you want to see
[1:23:50] things I remember for years I never
[1:23:52] cared about anything but we lived we
[1:23:54] lived in a little house we didn't live
[1:23:56] in a golf course neighborhood but we
[1:23:57] were across from the golf course and
[1:23:59] there was a way that we would drive to
[1:24:01] church on Sunday morning that was
[1:24:02] through that neighborhood
[1:24:04] and I remember something changing for me
[1:24:06] and I was so grieved that people were
[1:24:08] mowing their lawns
[1:24:11] I was so grieved that people were
[1:24:13] playing golf
[1:24:15] and not honoring God on that day I mean
[1:24:17] we're not we're not Sabbath worshipers
[1:24:19] but the prophet said we honor that
[1:24:20] that's right you know the prophets I've
[1:24:23] heard stories where people were throwing
[1:24:25] a ball in his side yard and he told him
[1:24:26] to stop it's the Sabbath day
[1:24:29] you know we shouldn't be doing our
[1:24:30] household chores on the oh you're a
[1:24:32] legalist no I'm I'm primed to follow the
[1:24:35] word I'm trying to follow the message of
[1:24:36] the hour
[1:24:37] but there's something inside of me that
[1:24:40] says let's let's set a day aside and
[1:24:42] respect God
[1:24:44] and spend our time
[1:24:46] in the in the in the kingdom of God and
[1:24:48] I know brother Paul was you know he had
[1:24:50] to go do stuff and I know there's things
[1:24:52] that have to be done sometimes but we
[1:24:55] don't plan to do it it's like people
[1:24:56] that
[1:24:57] plan not to come to church on Wednesday
[1:24:59] night
[1:25:01] Grieves me you know it Grieves me
[1:25:04] because because this maybe is a little
[1:25:06] too pastoral brother but I mean
[1:25:08] you know Hebrews 10 you know forsake not
[1:25:11] the assembling that's not Church
[1:25:12] attendance
[1:25:14] it's something that's happening Among Us
[1:25:17] right now that's coming that we want to
[1:25:20] be together and that's why it Grieves me
[1:25:23] to hear these internet Ministries it
[1:25:25] Grieves me to see people that are out
[1:25:27] just listening to tapes by themselves
[1:25:29] and they have no interaction no
[1:25:31] Fellowship no accountability because the
[1:25:34] basis of the whole thing is fellowship
[1:25:37] and we should be coming back to this
[1:25:39] position that's what a priest is a
[1:25:43] priest is somebody that is sharing the
[1:25:44] kingdom of God and that's what Jesus is
[1:25:46] saying here he says who then is the wise
[1:25:48] faithful and wise servant whom his Lord
[1:25:50] hath made ruler over his household to
[1:25:53] give him meat in due season blessed is
[1:25:56] that servant whom his Lord when he
[1:25:58] cometh shall find so doing verily I say
[1:26:01] unto you that he shall make him ruler
[1:26:04] over all his Goods
[1:26:07] so here's the question
[1:26:10] all right there's a principle that I
[1:26:12] look at in the day of Paul now Paul
[1:26:15] sowed the word
[1:26:16] but there were even things because Paul
[1:26:18] was caught beyond the curtain of time
[1:26:20] there were things he couldn't talk about
[1:26:22] amen he saw things he couldn't talk
[1:26:24] about
[1:26:25] did in my own pet Doctrine kind of a way
[1:26:28] I believe is revealed here at the end
[1:26:30] time
[1:26:31] but people had the Holy Ghost but they
[1:26:34] could only
[1:26:36] go as far into the Holy Ghost as what
[1:26:39] there was word available
[1:26:40] and so even in the Dark Ages where you
[1:26:43] say hey nobody had nothing the prophet
[1:26:45] said they received the word for the day
[1:26:48] they had they were they had the baptism
[1:26:49] of the Holy Ghost but let's say the dirt
[1:26:52] the Dark Ages is so dark that I don't
[1:26:55] know if you know this but Colombo didn't
[1:26:56] even live in the Dark Ages
[1:26:59] he came and went before that that period
[1:27:02] of the fire attire even started so
[1:27:04] that's how dark it was the messenger
[1:27:06] couldn't even live in that age
[1:27:08] right and so but they were born again
[1:27:12] because they believed that message
[1:27:15] and and and they Rose to whatever word
[1:27:19] was available in their day
[1:27:22] so the words being restored you know
[1:27:25] when it was back in the late day of
[1:27:27] Lutheran the day of of Wesleyan it
[1:27:29] wasn't just Luther and Wesley those were
[1:27:31] the principal Messengers but there was
[1:27:33] great men through that time and God is
[1:27:35] restoring his word and people are rising
[1:27:38] to match that word
[1:27:40] right but what kind of people should we
[1:27:42] be if we're living in the fullness of
[1:27:44] the world
[1:27:46] there's not one thing that hinders us
[1:27:48] from coming into a complete
[1:27:51] ought to be fully redeemed position
[1:27:56] and that's who we are and that's what
[1:27:58] that's what this eating the book
[1:28:00] is about because eating the book is is
[1:28:04] feeding on who I am that's right amen
[1:28:07] it's it's it's not like okay the
[1:28:09] preacher man he got long today man if if
[1:28:12] you're listening to if you're sitting in
[1:28:13] a lawyer's office and you're listening
[1:28:15] to the will be be read
[1:28:17] and it's your will
[1:28:19] you are wide awake listening for how
[1:28:23] much stuff you get
[1:28:26] and you know the fear is that people
[1:28:28] just aren't engaged you know they're not
[1:28:31] engaged with with what it is and so so
[1:28:33] you see the principle here
[1:28:36] that the the fullness of the word will
[1:28:39] put us in now I know I and I said it
[1:28:42] last night we're gonna make mistakes
[1:28:44] we're going to make mistakes till we get
[1:28:46] out of here but there's a perspective
[1:28:48] and I'll and I deal with it this way you
[1:28:51] know what Divine Healing is
[1:28:53] Divine Healing is not God is going to
[1:28:55] heal me
[1:28:57] Divine Healing as I am healed right now
[1:29:00] and and my declaration that healing is
[1:29:03] the absolute substance of my healing
[1:29:06] and I don't care how much symptoms I
[1:29:09] have
[1:29:10] I don't care what the doctor says I
[1:29:12] don't care about any of that I know I am
[1:29:14] healed right now
[1:29:16] and so I'm standing in this position
[1:29:20] and the prophet said we we have
[1:29:23] rapturing faith so rapturing faith is
[1:29:27] not I'm going to be rapture
[1:29:30] but it's that I am right now entering
[1:29:32] into this condition and I don't care
[1:29:35] what kind of circumstances testify
[1:29:37] against me I'm going to believe God's
[1:29:40] word because that's where my Revelation
[1:29:42] comes from that's who I am
[1:29:44] and so God is looking for a people and
[1:29:47] Luke he says in a different way he says
[1:29:49] when the son of man comes will he find
[1:29:51] faith on the Earth
[1:29:53] because that faith on the earth is not
[1:29:55] your faith it's his faith
[1:29:58] it's his virtues perfected in a bride
[1:30:01] which is what should happen if the
[1:30:03] fullness of the word is waved before us
[1:30:05] then that's what it is
[1:30:08] right now let's get I just really felt I
[1:30:10] woke up at four o'clock this morning I'm
[1:30:11] thinking about these things
[1:30:14] and I couldn't go back to sleep and so
[1:30:16] the Lord just was speaking to my heart
[1:30:18] and said go go to Song of Solomon
[1:30:22] now Song of Solomon is a is a special
[1:30:25] special book to me and I just share a
[1:30:28] little personal thing well I mean I'm
[1:30:30] looking at looking at song with Solomon
[1:30:31] of course we study these things all the
[1:30:33] time you know but then I found out that
[1:30:36] in the Jewish religion there are four
[1:30:39] books that they don't let any of their
[1:30:41] children touch until they're mature
[1:30:43] enough
[1:30:44] and one of them is Esther the Book of
[1:30:46] Esther Proverbs Ecclesiastes and song
[1:30:50] because Song of Solomon is is is
[1:30:54] they think it's too erotic
[1:30:57] you know and it is I mean it's very but
[1:30:59] it's but it's the most beautiful that's
[1:31:02] right book in in the it's one of the
[1:31:04] most beautiful books in the Bible
[1:31:06] it's it's pure poetry and I and I went I
[1:31:11] I I was feeling it was probably back in
[1:31:13] 2015 or 16 or whatever and I was feeling
[1:31:17] definitely LED
[1:31:18] to preach on Song of Solomon
[1:31:21] so I got up and it was in January and I
[1:31:24] got up and we took we took the first
[1:31:26] chapter of Song of Solomon
[1:31:28] and I go through 17 verses here I go
[1:31:30] through that first chapter
[1:31:32] in one service
[1:31:34] and I'm like okay well there's
[1:31:36] eight chapters so that'd be eight
[1:31:38] Services sometimes you feel pretty good
[1:31:40] when you have something laid out in
[1:31:42] front of you you know and you know the
[1:31:44] Lord's one and so when I got done with
[1:31:47] that message that day
[1:31:49] the Lord spoke to my heart and he said
[1:31:51] you remember that
[1:31:54] brother Branham was hunting with that
[1:31:55] Indian guy
[1:31:57] and they're going up to hunt elk
[1:32:00] and the Indian guy is telling brother
[1:32:02] Branham what is your hurry
[1:32:05] and brother Brandon says well I'm going
[1:32:06] up where the L car
[1:32:08] an Indian says elk live there they'll be
[1:32:10] there when we get there
[1:32:13] he says he says to end in
[1:32:17] takes takes one step and look them nine
[1:32:21] times
[1:32:22] and so the Lord was telling me slow down
[1:32:26] you are missing
[1:32:28] what's going on I preached 64 messages
[1:32:32] on the Song of Solomon
[1:32:34] 64 messages and it was amazing but this
[1:32:39] fourth chapter I just want to read a
[1:32:41] little bit of this this scripture
[1:32:43] because see it has to do with our
[1:32:45] position
[1:32:46] that's what we're interested in we exalt
[1:32:49] Christ as if Christ is out here but but
[1:32:52] Christ is in us and it's the positional
[1:32:55] placing of a bride and I'm not and I'm
[1:32:58] not saying and maybe I'm out even out of
[1:33:01] because I I don't know when it doesn't
[1:33:02] I'm just going to tell you my heart I'm
[1:33:05] seeing the message get into a lot of
[1:33:06] psychology
[1:33:08] and it's marriage counseling and and
[1:33:10] financial counseling and all this stuff
[1:33:13] what kind of thing will not be fixed by
[1:33:16] our positional placing
[1:33:19] what kind if we know who we are it will
[1:33:22] make me treat my wife right it will make
[1:33:24] me deal with my finances right it will
[1:33:27] fix everything in my life because it
[1:33:29] will be as if Christ is living
[1:33:32] and so that's that's the way I choose
[1:33:36] there's a scripture in second Peter you
[1:33:38] know I mean in the first chapter and
[1:33:39] he's just gone through the statue of
[1:33:41] perfect man and everything and and then
[1:33:43] he says
[1:33:45] as long as I'm In the Flesh I'm going to
[1:33:48] bring you in remembrance of these things
[1:33:51] so that's who I am
[1:33:53] maybe you know if I preach here all the
[1:33:56] time maybe your man brother Stan if he
[1:33:58] just would quit talking about the rest
[1:33:59] all the time
[1:34:01] you know but I am going to keep bringing
[1:34:04] us into remembrance amen of an eternal
[1:34:07] position in Christ amen until we all
[1:34:10] step in and I'll tell you what
[1:34:12] I'm not saying I've arrived but I tell
[1:34:14] you what it never gets old to me
[1:34:17] I re I remember my pastor probably the
[1:34:20] last couple of years that he ministered
[1:34:22] before he before he decided to step down
[1:34:24] because he I think he knew Alzheimer's
[1:34:26] was coming and everything but he's like
[1:34:29] preaching on the eldership
[1:34:31] that we should be stepping up I mean
[1:34:33] Elders Among Us you know when he would
[1:34:35] go through the early church and he and
[1:34:37] he preached it and and people were
[1:34:39] saying gosh when is he going to get done
[1:34:41] with this eldership thing
[1:34:43] and I thought as soon as we get it
[1:34:46] as soon as we see the value of what he's
[1:34:49] looking at here
[1:34:51] you know and so this this this
[1:34:54] fourth chapter let's begin let's begin
[1:34:56] and you know that this is this is the
[1:34:59] bride and Christ bride and Christ you
[1:35:01] know I mean it's talking back and forth
[1:35:02] and it says in verse 9 and this is the
[1:35:05] bridegroom talking to the bride he says
[1:35:08] thou has ravished my heart my sister my
[1:35:11] spouse thou has ravished my heart with
[1:35:13] one of thine eyes with one chain of thy
[1:35:16] neck
[1:35:16] what this literally said this is a very
[1:35:19] poetic term that's in it's in Hebrew
[1:35:21] literature
[1:35:22] and what and what the basis of what he's
[1:35:25] saying is you put heart in me
[1:35:29] but there's even a deeper meaning that I
[1:35:31] was reading I was reading this this man
[1:35:34] that knows a lot about Hebrew and a lot
[1:35:35] about the the not tradition but the uh
[1:35:38] origin of things and and and and
[1:35:40] literature and stuff and so he looks at
[1:35:42] it he says this word ravish really means
[1:35:46] you unbarked me
[1:35:48] all right now think about what that
[1:35:50] means Brother David knows that a tree I
[1:35:53] I mean I'm like I don't know anything
[1:35:55] about trees and I always thought like
[1:35:56] okay here's a tree the life's in the
[1:35:58] middle but did you know that the life of
[1:36:00] the tree is right under the bark
[1:36:03] and the bark is is the tree's protection
[1:36:08] and what he is saying to the bride is
[1:36:12] I'm taking off all of my protection
[1:36:15] I'm taking you completely into myself
[1:36:19] and and and it's as if a a great Soldier
[1:36:23] comes back from a battle
[1:36:25] you know what he's got all his armor and
[1:36:27] everything on and he comes in through
[1:36:29] the door of the home and he takes all
[1:36:31] the armor off because he's in a safe
[1:36:33] haven well God looks at that in you amen
[1:36:37] amen I mean it's so beautiful the way
[1:36:40] but he says let's let's go down because
[1:36:42] this is good how fair is thy love my
[1:36:44] sister my spouse watch he calls her
[1:36:46] sister you know and I wondered about
[1:36:48] that but see
[1:36:50] he could call her my spouse but in our
[1:36:53] human way of thinking a spouse is
[1:36:55] something that begins and it could end
[1:36:59] but you can never not be the brother of
[1:37:02] a sister
[1:37:03] and so he's saying that there's a tie
[1:37:06] here there's a connection here that's
[1:37:08] greater than just a human thought of
[1:37:11] marrying somebody
[1:37:13] and so so he says he says uh it's better
[1:37:18] than thy love than Wine and the smell of
[1:37:20] thine ointment and all spices thy lips
[1:37:22] oh my spouse drop as the honeycomb honey
[1:37:25] and milk are under thy tongue and the
[1:37:28] smell of thy garments is like the smell
[1:37:30] of Lebanon now watch this a garden
[1:37:33] enclosed is my sister my spouse a spring
[1:37:37] shut up a fountain sealed and that's
[1:37:39] what we were for seven Church ages
[1:37:42] because we didn't know what we were and
[1:37:45] who we were and even in Romans 8 it
[1:37:48] talks about the spirit itself
[1:37:50] deals it speaks instead of us
[1:37:53] because we don't know what to say we
[1:37:56] don't know what to pray we don't know
[1:37:58] the will of God so we're praying things
[1:37:59] I remember my pastor one of the last
[1:38:02] times he spoke for us he said I prayed
[1:38:04] and prayed and prayed for things and
[1:38:06] thank God he didn't give to me
[1:38:08] yeah that's the truth because because
[1:38:11] there's a there's the spirit itself is
[1:38:14] groaning inside of us
[1:38:16] with with prayers
[1:38:18] but see that's what I see that's what I
[1:38:21] see that's the point of prayers of the
[1:38:22] Saints in Revelations 5 9 because the
[1:38:25] opening of the book has taken away the
[1:38:28] veil of the Flesh and we know the will
[1:38:30] of God and we don't just pray but we
[1:38:33] actually declare the word
[1:38:36] that's the speaking of the word oh we
[1:38:38] could go into that we did the other day
[1:38:40] it somewhere somewhere we preached but
[1:38:43] there's a quote in in Hebrews and that's
[1:38:45] Hebrews uh questions answered in Hebrews
[1:38:47] part three and I was looking for
[1:38:49] everything that I could find that
[1:38:50] brother Branham said about the tree of
[1:38:52] life and in this quote brother Branham
[1:38:54] says in that tree talking about the Tree
[1:38:56] of Life in that tree dwells prayer
[1:38:59] I thought wow what does that mean
[1:39:02] because I always thought prayer is like
[1:39:03] I'm asking God for something
[1:39:06] see when you're asking God for something
[1:39:08] the other half of that prayer is
[1:39:10] god-given
[1:39:13] so in that tree
[1:39:15] in the tree of life that we are
[1:39:18] dwells the answer
[1:39:21] to prayer
[1:39:22] you see that's the speaking of the word
[1:39:25] that's when God has taken preeminence
[1:39:28] and preeminence is not meaning that okay
[1:39:30] he's got two percent of my life and
[1:39:32] football's got a one percent and cooking
[1:39:35] has one percent and all this you know we
[1:39:37] have a big long list but he's he's first
[1:39:40] I want to talk one time at one of our
[1:39:42] ministers meeting about preeminence of
[1:39:44] Christ and her brother said oh I said
[1:39:45] that just means he's first
[1:39:47] preeminence means he's the only thing
[1:39:50] that's right
[1:39:51] he's the only thing he's the control
[1:39:54] tower you still have your five senses
[1:39:57] all right I don't want to get in the
[1:39:59] areas of spirit and soul because that's
[1:40:01] a kind of a question you know I mean
[1:40:02] people with terminology everything but I
[1:40:04] will I do know this
[1:40:06] my brother Brandon went to the board and
[1:40:08] then the message at North at night he
[1:40:10] drove three circuits circles
[1:40:12] and he says that's you
[1:40:15] he said that's God Amen so I'm thinking
[1:40:18] okay and me
[1:40:19] I got this middle circle you know and
[1:40:21] that's where kind of the question is you
[1:40:23] know is that Soul or Spirit Well it's
[1:40:25] actually scripturally it's the spirit
[1:40:27] but the terminology of the Prophet used
[1:40:29] especially toward the end is that's the
[1:40:30] soul that's right
[1:40:32] but in but in the Bible the word Soul
[1:40:34] talks about the whole life right
[1:40:37] right so it's the terminology is
[1:40:39] different but let's stay with that
[1:40:40] terminology so in that soul is the
[1:40:42] attribute that's the seed of God that's
[1:40:44] who you are
[1:40:45] and outside of that in the second realm
[1:40:48] there's memory conscious reason and
[1:40:50] affection imagination right and then on
[1:40:52] the outside of that is is you know see
[1:40:55] feel taste smelling here you know five
[1:40:58] senses
[1:40:59] and there's nothing wrong with that and
[1:41:01] when the prophets said that I'm thinking
[1:41:03] well God has memory conscious reason
[1:41:05] affection imagination right
[1:41:07] because I remember in in
[1:41:10] excuse me whenever uh
[1:41:13] Samson is standing there with us with
[1:41:15] his arm on the pillars
[1:41:17] and he said God remember me amen
[1:41:21] he says I don't want my thought of all
[1:41:24] my failures
[1:41:25] I don't want my thought of my womanizing
[1:41:27] I don't want my thought of of of of
[1:41:29] giving away the secret of my strength I
[1:41:31] don't want it I don't want you to
[1:41:33] remember that I want your memory of your
[1:41:36] original Commission of me
[1:41:38] and so he pushes the walls and the place
[1:41:41] fell down
[1:41:42] right so God's memory then in in Isaiah
[1:41:45] 1 I think it is or somewhere come let us
[1:41:48] reason together
[1:41:49] so there's reasoning
[1:41:51] you know God has affections
[1:41:53] God loves things God hates things
[1:41:56] amen
[1:41:58] well God doesn't have imagination
[1:41:59] imagination is not Disney World
[1:42:02] imagination means a plan
[1:42:04] it means a purpose
[1:42:06] okay that's what that word means if you
[1:42:08] have imagination you are you're
[1:42:09] formulating a plan
[1:42:11] right it's not some kind of fantasy land
[1:42:15] thing so God has these qualities but how
[1:42:18] are God's qualities fed
[1:42:20] from the inside that's
[1:42:23] right because that attribute that soul
[1:42:26] that that who God is
[1:42:28] and and you put it on a chart and the
[1:42:31] arrows are going out
[1:42:33] and so he has a memory that had that
[1:42:35] came from his soul he had a memory he
[1:42:37] has an affection that comes from his
[1:42:38] soul he has a all these things but see
[1:42:41] when we come in the world we're the
[1:42:42] opposite
[1:42:44] because we came in the world without
[1:42:47] real access to who we are in our soul
[1:42:50] is this okay we don't have access really
[1:42:53] we get mixed signals
[1:42:56] you know we have okay I want I want a
[1:42:58] better life I want something I want a
[1:43:00] better life and we buy a new car
[1:43:03] but really what we're crying out for is
[1:43:05] is a life with God right but so we walk
[1:43:09] through this life and I got and I got I
[1:43:11] got taste I got smell okay so I smell
[1:43:14] something oh that's bad
[1:43:16] all right so now I have fed my memory
[1:43:20] from the outside
[1:43:22] you see and I'm not going to do that
[1:43:24] again
[1:43:25] uh like you like brother Paul and I were
[1:43:27] talking about this morning about brother
[1:43:29] Branham said the woman that she's
[1:43:30] cooking the the sausage on the on the
[1:43:33] stove you know when she Burns her hand
[1:43:35] well she's got a feeling
[1:43:37] and brother Branham said if she would
[1:43:38] just not fear and just go on doing what
[1:43:42] she's doing it would be all right but
[1:43:43] she runs off
[1:43:45] you know she goes and gets the unguin
[1:43:47] teen I mean that kind of dates you if
[1:43:49] you know what onion team is
[1:43:51] But but so she's got a memory
[1:43:55] that's been fed by her feeling
[1:43:58] but see when we're born again
[1:44:01] that's what brother Brandon referred to
[1:44:02] when we have a new control tower
[1:44:05] so now we have something in us that's
[1:44:07] driving us from a different direction
[1:44:10] right
[1:44:11] and so that's what he's saying here
[1:44:14] you're a garden enclosed amen you're a
[1:44:17] well you're a spring your spring shut up
[1:44:20] you're a fountain sealed and so
[1:44:23] something has to happen
[1:44:26] for for that to be released
[1:44:29] and for every and and for you to step
[1:44:32] into this position of living for others
[1:44:35] because you can't do it correctly in a
[1:44:37] human way
[1:44:39] right and so he says he says verse 13
[1:44:41] thy plants are an orchard or
[1:44:43] pomegranates oh I gotta stop on that
[1:44:47] okay got to stop on that we're sharing
[1:44:49] that with with the the Saints there I
[1:44:51] forget where it was we were I think it
[1:44:53] was at the Spanish Church talking about
[1:44:54] the pomegranates
[1:44:56] how many have ever wondered about the
[1:44:58] pomegranates on the on the priest robe
[1:45:01] I have
[1:45:02] I wondered what in the world is that
[1:45:05] and you know brother Branham would
[1:45:06] describe okay it's it's described
[1:45:08] there's a bell and a pomegranate Bella
[1:45:10] and a pomegranate you know and so
[1:45:11] brother Brandon would describe those
[1:45:12] bells that that priest had to walk holy
[1:45:14] holy holy under Lord those bells made a
[1:45:17] certain noise
[1:45:18] but I wonder what in the world
[1:45:20] does the word pomegranate what does that
[1:45:22] have to do with anything
[1:45:24] and so I was at my daughter's in Canada
[1:45:27] I think it was last year or sometime
[1:45:29] year before last and I'm studying these
[1:45:31] words and I love following words in the
[1:45:33] scripture
[1:45:34] all right because you can take and I've
[1:45:37] got some books that that you know you
[1:45:39] can cross the Greek word over to the
[1:45:41] Hebrew word and if you can get to the
[1:45:43] Hebrew word every Hebrew word comes to a
[1:45:47] two-letter or three-letter root word
[1:45:50] and the and the meaning of that two or
[1:45:52] three letter root word influences
[1:45:55] everything in those words
[1:45:58] I mean it becomes the basis of what
[1:46:01] those words mean so I'm following this
[1:46:03] and I'm reading Revelations 10 you know
[1:46:06] verse 8 to 11 which we should
[1:46:08] and it says you know eat the book
[1:46:11] and why do you eat the book because you
[1:46:12] must prophesy
[1:46:14] right you must prophesy
[1:46:16] okay that's the kind of brother Prophet
[1:46:18] brother Branham was
[1:46:20] he wasn't an Old Testament Prophet that
[1:46:22] the word came to that he came out of the
[1:46:24] Wilderness but he was a first fruits of
[1:46:27] a bride
[1:46:28] that is a deliverer of the word okay and
[1:46:32] so and so I'm looking at this word so I
[1:46:35] so I cross it over to the to the to the
[1:46:37] Hebrew equivalent
[1:46:39] and do you know that the root word of
[1:46:41] prophet prophesy prophecy is the word
[1:46:44] seed
[1:46:47] so that a seed
[1:46:50] is what comes in Prophecy
[1:46:53] now here's where it goes good did you
[1:46:55] know that the pomegranate
[1:46:57] is a fruit that has more seeds than any
[1:47:00] other seed
[1:47:02] so think about this because a robe to me
[1:47:05] I mean you look at Second Corinthians 5
[1:47:08] and it talks about being clothed
[1:47:09] Revelation 3 talks about being clothed
[1:47:13] so theophany is a garment we wear
[1:47:17] right it is a condition it's a low cost
[1:47:19] condition to the bride
[1:47:21] and just maybe just maybe and I'm not
[1:47:23] saying this is the the full
[1:47:25] understanding of it but it's what I it's
[1:47:27] what I see when that woman touched the
[1:47:29] border of of Jesus garment
[1:47:32] okay
[1:47:33] the prophet said she had no scripture
[1:47:36] you told her to do that
[1:47:39] but there was an election
[1:47:41] inside of her and said if I could if I
[1:47:44] could get one of those seeds
[1:47:46] from the high priest garment
[1:47:49] then that will be for my healing you see
[1:47:52] who you are amen creation is looking for
[1:47:56] a place where the fruit amen twelves to
[1:47:59] where the seeds can be expressed and so
[1:48:02] that's what he says a garden closes thy
[1:48:04] plants are as an orchard of pomegranates
[1:48:07] with Pleasant fruits camphor spiknerd
[1:48:10] spikner and saffron calamus cinnamon
[1:48:13] with all trees of a frankincense myrrh
[1:48:16] aloes and Chiefs spices and watch this
[1:48:19] a fountain of gardens a well of living
[1:48:22] Gardens and streams from Lebanon awake o
[1:48:26] Northwind and Come Thou South and blow
[1:48:29] upon my garden that the spices thereof
[1:48:32] May flow out
[1:48:34] let my beloved come into his garden and
[1:48:37] eat his Pleasant fruits this is the
[1:48:40] seventh seal right here right brother
[1:48:42] David this is the seventh seal let him
[1:48:45] come into his garden so that the spices
[1:48:49] can come out and it and it's the
[1:48:51] Fulfillment verse 1 of chapter five I am
[1:48:54] come into my garden my sister my spouse
[1:48:57] I've gathered my myrrh and my spice and
[1:48:59] I have eaten my honeycomb with my honey
[1:49:02] I have drunk with my wine with my milk
[1:49:05] eat eat o friends
[1:49:08] God eat oh friends
[1:49:12] drink drink abundantly yes oh beloved
[1:49:17] amen do you love him
[1:49:19] amen Amen brother Alex if he could come
[1:49:22] to the to the pan I want to sing a I
[1:49:25] want to sing that song I Give Myself
[1:49:27] Away
[1:49:29] you sing it a little bit differently I
[1:49:30] think here than than we do at home or
[1:49:32] somebody sister or somebody can come to
[1:49:34] the piano because I am not an acapello
[1:49:36] singer
[1:49:40] I don't know what the number is brother
[1:49:42] I give myself away is the name of it
[1:49:51] let's start with the with the chorus
[1:50:02] and sing this with me we're not let's
[1:50:04] all stand let's sing because this is a
[1:50:06] word this is a a solemn hour
[1:50:10] and you know I have I have been in the
[1:50:12] message a long time and like it was like
[1:50:14] all about man if I could just learn
[1:50:16] enough if I could just listen to tapes
[1:50:19] enough if I could just pray enough I
[1:50:21] will finally have achieved
[1:50:24] and I realized it's all about surrender
[1:50:27] it's all I have to do is surrender you
[1:50:31] know I may said it last night or said it
[1:50:33] several times but brother Brenner said
[1:50:35] in perfect strength and perfect weakness
[1:50:37] he said it's not problem the problem's
[1:50:38] not that we're not strong enough that's
[1:50:40] right he said the problem is we're not
[1:50:42] weak enough because we have to to master
[1:50:45] the thought of human ability that we
[1:50:47] can't do it
[1:50:49] and so we are the body that he wears
[1:50:53] so all we have to do is give ourselves
[1:50:55] to him and you know what he knows
[1:50:58] exactly what he wants done with his word
[1:51:01] so let's sing this I Give Myself Away
[1:51:09] Give Myself Away
[1:51:12] so you can use me I Give Myself Away
[1:51:22] thank you Lord
[1:51:24] I give myself away
[1:51:27] so you can use me here I stand
[1:51:36] Here I Am
[1:51:39] Lord my life is in your hands
[1:51:46] Lord I'm

[1:52:13] Give Myself Away
[1:52:19] give myself away
[1:52:21] so you can use me take my heart
[1:52:29] take my life

[1:52:45] Lord I give them in your hands I Give
[1:52:53] Myself Away
[1:52:57] [Music]
[1:52:58] I give myself away so you can use me I

[1:53:25] have to share a story
[1:53:27] because we sing we're singing this song
[1:53:29] I Give Myself Away
[1:53:31] do we really believe
[1:53:34] that
[1:53:36] are we really believing that we're
[1:53:38] giving ourself away because I want to
[1:53:40] share a story which I've shared all over
[1:53:42] everywhere I go there was a man in
[1:53:44] Venezuela and his name is Daniel Pacheco
[1:53:48] and he was going to a Revival meeting
[1:53:50] and he was on a bus and like they do in
[1:53:53] those countries the Police Stopped the
[1:53:55] bus and they searched the bus and they
[1:53:56] found drugs
[1:53:58] and they said okay and they lined
[1:54:00] everybody up whose drugs are these
[1:54:02] and and the bus driver pointed it
[1:54:05] brother Daniel
[1:54:06] said they're his drugs
[1:54:08] and he said no they're not all I have is
[1:54:10] this backpack that's all I'm taking I'm
[1:54:12] on a way to it they didn't believe him
[1:54:14] they arrested him
[1:54:15] they arrested the guy who fessed up that
[1:54:17] they were his drugs and he said this guy
[1:54:19] has nothing but it didn't matter they
[1:54:21] didn't believe him they arrested Daniel
[1:54:23] Pacheco Daniel Pacheco had a wife he has
[1:54:27] two kids and his daughter and his and
[1:54:29] his wife was six months pregnant
[1:54:32] Daniel Pacheco goes to prison
[1:54:35] and he and he just got out this last
[1:54:38] spring but he had been in prison for
[1:54:40] eight or ten years
[1:54:42] in the message a message believer who
[1:54:45] had a wife and a whole family but when
[1:54:48] he got to prison
[1:54:50] he met a bunch of Believers and said
[1:54:52] we've been praying God would send us a
[1:54:54] passage
[1:54:56] so are we are we that sacrificed in our
[1:54:59] life that that because this is like okay
[1:55:02] God I am committed to you as long as
[1:55:05] things are going the way I want them to
[1:55:07] go
[1:55:07] but you know there's a scripture in
[1:55:10] Matthew 25 there's a great Throne
[1:55:12] there's a great judgment goats and the
[1:55:14] Sheep
[1:55:15] and you know what one of those said I
[1:55:18] was in prison and you visited me
[1:55:21] so what God would you allow God to put
[1:55:25] you into a condition that where you're
[1:55:27] in prison so that another category of
[1:55:30] election can manifest who they are
[1:55:33] that's a sacrifice life and so I can't
[1:55:37] do it Stan price can't do it
[1:55:39] but the spirit of God in Me can
[1:55:43] sacrifice his life amen I Give Myself
[1:55:47] Away
[1:55:53] um
[1:55:57] so you can use me I give myself away

[1:57:31] amen I tell you
[1:57:34] you know I'm just always amazed
[1:57:37] how that God can just bring things in
[1:57:40] such a fashion lay them out for us and
[1:57:43] as I was thinking as brother Stan is
[1:57:46] speaking I was thinking about that and
[1:57:50] how sweet communion you know we had
[1:57:52] communion this morning amen he was
[1:57:55] speaking to us and we were speaking back
[1:57:57] to him we were saying yes Lord I love
[1:58:01] you my husband yes I believe and it just
[1:58:05] stirred my heart my brother and sister
[1:58:07] because you know as he's talking about
[1:58:10] Melchizedek
[1:58:11] my brother and sister I want you to
[1:58:13] focus on this little small fact that
[1:58:16] Abraham was not preoccupied with
[1:58:20] business in the tent
[1:58:22] God ordained him to be looking out of
[1:58:26] the tent because there was something in
[1:58:28] his heart that said something's fixing
[1:58:31] to happen
[1:58:32] and he was looking for something that
[1:58:35] was coming and he was focused on that
[1:58:38] and as it is my brother and sister we
[1:58:40] can say he is coming but we heard our
[1:58:43] brother last night and to this morning
[1:58:45] is not looking for his coming he is here
[1:58:50] amen we are a blessed people to know our
[1:58:53] Melchizedek is on the scene he is here

[1:59:34] but he loves me enough to bring a word
[1:59:36] to me
[1:59:38] he loves me enough to speak to me in the
[1:59:41] Midnight Hour
[1:59:43] he loves me enough to heal my body
[1:59:45] he loves me enough when I'm discouraged
[1:59:49] to encourage me

[1:59:55] that when my son who's not serving the
[1:59:57] lord

[2:00:09] and he loved me enough to give me that
[2:00:13] promise that I can stand with confidence
[2:00:16] and say
