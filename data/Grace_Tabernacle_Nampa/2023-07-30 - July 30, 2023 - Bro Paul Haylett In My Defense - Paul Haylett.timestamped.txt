[42:18] is actually supposed to be vacation for
[42:20] him but uh anyway
[42:23] um we're we're actually giving a much
[42:25] more vacation than brother Eugene is
[42:27] because brother Eugene's gone in
[42:28] preaching Family Camp uh for his
[42:30] vacation and then brother Chad is giving
[42:33] him some more vacation for a weekend of
[42:35] preaching and uh so we want to be the
[42:38] ones that give that but he will be
[42:40] ministering Lord willing uh Wednesday uh
[42:43] and uh so uh remember Saints share it
[42:46] with one another come camp out
[42:49] come sleep on the Rocks eat burnt hot
[42:51] dogs just come have fun amen and so also
[42:57] I want to announce that I don't have a
[42:59] definitive date here but Brother David
[43:01] Nash and I have been collaborating on
[43:04] having our brother Stan price from
[43:06] Florida we'll be coming out him and his
[43:08] wife have never been West and so uh he's
[43:11] going to come spend a little time with
[43:13] Brother David I think preaching the
[43:15] Tri-Cities and I do believe if our plans
[43:18] are are solidified that he will be here
[43:21] to preach for us at the end of that time
[43:24] which would be somewhere around that
[43:25] weekend of the 19th or 20th of August
[43:28] and I don't know if you're familiar with
[43:30] brother Stan just a stable brother
[43:33] pastors at church been around for many
[43:35] years seen the shaking of the heavens
[43:39] and the Earth seen all of these things
[43:40] and yet still standing solid on the word
[43:43] got a lovely group of Believers there in
[43:46] Florida so we want to uh just be in
[43:50] prayer for both of those times and
[43:53] um
[43:54] it just uh I think be a real blessing to
[43:58] us amen and so we want to be in prayer
[44:02] for those that are out we have a lot of
[44:04] brothers and sisters not here this
[44:06] morning for various reasons uh and uh we
[44:11] just want uh
[44:12] the Lord to just come move in their
[44:14] presence amen and remember it's good
[44:17] therapy if we believe in therapy some
[44:19] people say I don't believe in therapy
[44:21] but I believe in therapy the Holy Ghost
[44:23] comes down starts to deal with our heart
[44:25] and the therapy that happens we in a
[44:28] time of anxiety find peace
[44:30] in the find of trouble we find security
[44:33] in these things this is a therapy the
[44:36] prophet of God showed us he says when
[44:38] you have these needs prayer is our
[44:42] answer amen thank you Lord for that
[44:44] Hallelujah don't even have to make an
[44:46] appointment isn't that awesome you can
[44:48] just Anytime Anyplace whether it's
[44:50] freeway traffic or whether you're in the
[44:52] middle of the field and the wheels have
[44:54] fallen off the wagon you can just stop
[44:55] and do that and once again uh let's
[44:59] remember our sister April I think we
[45:01] kind of left her out of the prayer
[45:03] request right there but um I think she's
[45:06] up to be with her nephews for
[45:09] um Camp
[45:10] um at Living Word and uh my house she
[45:13] loves those nephews amen I I just uh she
[45:17] just loves those nephews that's all I
[45:19] think I need to say so remember her she
[45:22] desired to be here but she also desired
[45:24] to be there with with the family and
[45:27] once again
[45:28] um we just want to
[45:29] um
[45:30] welcome brother Jeremy sister Emily and
[45:33] sister Emily well I can sound all gushy
[45:36] and mushy I used to think of her as a
[45:39] extended daughter you know like you can
[45:42] reach out and just adopt someone out of
[45:44] a family like whether they like it or
[45:46] not and
[45:47] um but anyway we have just such uh fond
[45:50] and loving memories of our sister Emily
[45:53] always liked her a little bit feisty and
[45:56] she can shoot a gun
[45:58] and uh brother Jeremy I only met him
[46:00] once but we had a lovely time a little
[46:03] Fellowship in a restaurant there in
[46:06] Calgary and uh I don't know which one of
[46:08] you got the best into that deal but I
[46:10] think God knew what he was doing so amen
[46:13] let's just stand and go into the word I
[46:16] don't know our brother Logan maybe
[46:17] stepped out or something but we just
[46:20] definitely want to greet him also
[46:23] let's turn
[46:25] in Psalm the 62nd chapter verses 1
[46:29] through 12 and uh we just want to take
[46:33] our thought from this that God would
[46:36] just bless us with his word today
[46:38] you know my brother and sister
[46:41] it's always good you know I just um you
[46:43] have little things that anchor in your
[46:45] soul so in high school I was just this
[46:47] runty scrunt scrawny kid and um uh
[46:52] actually there's proof that there is uh
[46:55] uh Evolution metamorphosis I went from
[46:57] this scrawny scrawny kid to well anyway
[47:01] um but you know I had a friend named
[47:03] Randy and Randy was great big guy great
[47:06] great big guy hands like dinner plates
[47:09] went on to play at the highest level of
[47:11] college football and was very successful
[47:14] at that and uh Randy being my friend you
[47:17] know and kids would pick on me at school
[47:19] there would be as the proverbial cartoon
[47:21] has it the shadow that overwhelms
[47:24] everything comes over the scene and I
[47:27] didn't stand there in fear because I
[47:29] knew my friend Randy was there to defend
[47:32] me
[47:32] and so in the world we live in today
[47:35] Satan will like nothing more than you
[47:37] and I to live in the shadow of fear a
[47:40] shadow of anxiety a shadow of
[47:43] uncertainty by brother and sister but
[47:46] the shadow that we are in according to
[47:48] the word of God is the shadow of the
[47:50] wings of our Lord Jesus Christ amen and
[47:53] as we are here by being Sons and
[47:56] Daughters of God this Grand privilege
[47:57] that has been given to us amen my
[48:00] brother sister not obligation we'll
[48:02] touch on this a little later some people
[48:04] feel like serving God is obligation I
[48:07] view it and I trust that you view it as
[48:09] privilege amen that God says you know I
[48:12] chose you and and that's a grand
[48:14] privilege that we have been given amen
[48:16] and so we just want to look at this
[48:19] thought today amen truly my soul waiteth
[48:22] upon God from him cometh my salvation he
[48:27] only is my rock and my salvation he is
[48:30] my defense I shall not be greatly moved
[48:34] how long will ye imagine Mischief
[48:37] against a man ye shall be slain all of
[48:40] you as a Boeing wall shall ye be and as
[48:45] a tauntering fence
[48:47] no security either one of those amen
[48:52] they only consult to cast him down from
[48:54] his Excellency they Delight in lies they
[48:57] bless with their mouth but curse
[49:00] inwardly
[49:01] my soul wait thou only upon God now my
[49:05] brother and sister I want us to just
[49:07] take this if I could just throw this in
[49:09] right now so I don't have to come back
[49:11] amen speak to your soul
[49:14] amen
[49:16] the song says speak to the Rock Amen the
[49:20] word says abort upon your confession or
[49:23] profession of Faith so speak to your
[49:25] soul don't let your soul waver but speak
[49:28] to your soul and tell your soul amen
[49:31] amen let your soul know what your desire
[49:35] is and let it respond and when you're
[49:37] speaking these words you say can I
[49:39] change my soul well your soul has a seed
[49:43] in it and the expression of that seed my
[49:45] brother and sister can be influenced
[49:49] you say but I'm predestinated there's
[49:52] still influence go listen to influences
[49:54] I just studying influences as you go go
[49:57] there's influences there let me just
[49:59] throw a natural type sorry to keep you
[50:01] standing but my brother and sister I
[50:03] have a farm that we farm and along that
[50:06] is a giant row of trees and a very same
[50:09] fertilizer the same water the same seed
[50:13] is planted but the corn that is in the
[50:16] shadow or the beans or the wheat that's
[50:18] in the shadow of those trees never grows
[50:22] like it does in the sunlight
[50:24] it always you can watch it taper away of
[50:26] the length of the Shadow so I'm making
[50:29] this point to tell you that the light in
[50:32] the evening time because that's when the
[50:34] shadow comes upon this corn is important
[50:37] you can't just say we got the light my
[50:39] brother and sister it's light in the
[50:41] evening time that brings maturity
[50:46] thank you Lord
[50:49] yes my soul wait thou only upon God for
[50:53] my expectation is from him he only is my
[50:57] rock and my salvation he is my defense I
[51:01] shall not be moved and God is my
[51:03] salvation and my glory the rock of my
[51:06] strength and my refuge is in God
[51:12] trust in him at all times ye people pour
[51:16] out your heart before him God is a
[51:19] refuge for us see law surely men of low
[51:23] degree or vanity and Men of high degree
[51:26] are a lie to be laid in the balance they
[51:30] are altogether lighter than vanity trust
[51:33] not in oppression and become not vain in
[51:37] robbery if riches increase set not your
[51:40] heart upon them now it's not saying if
[51:42] you have riches that you are going to
[51:44] fail
[51:45] it's when our heart is set upon those
[51:50] riches
[51:52] if our heart is just on God Amen
[51:55] brother Jake and I just had this
[51:57] conversation he was wondering whether to
[51:59] go on down the road because he has an
[52:01] appointment to deliver and I loved it my
[52:04] heart stirred when he texted me back and
[52:06] said every time I put God first
[52:08] everything works out fine
[52:11] and so here he is with us this morning
[52:13] in church amen so you look at that my
[52:15] brother and sister that how God is there
[52:17] but become not in oppression
[52:21] and become not in vain robbery if Rich
[52:24] is increased setting out your heart upon
[52:25] them God hath spoken once twice have I
[52:28] heard this that power belongeth unto God
[52:31] also unto thee O Lord belongeth Mercy
[52:34] for thou rindereth to every man
[52:36] according to his work Heavenly Father we
[52:39] ask for your blessings today lead us
[52:41] guide us father speak to our hearts Lord
[52:44] may we find Liberty today and be able to
[52:47] just walk out saying truly it was good
[52:49] to be in the house of the Lord today we
[52:52] thank you in your precious name amen you
[52:54] may be seated Saints
[53:04] as we look upon this today my brother
[53:07] and sister
[53:09] I just look and as I was studying this
[53:13] and and uh looking through the whole
[53:16] picture you might say realize that we
[53:20] can claim a lot of things we can claim
[53:22] to be the greatest revelated or have
[53:27] more Revelation accumulated you might
[53:29] say or revealed than ever through
[53:32] history
[53:33] but my brother and sister if we are here
[53:36] with all of this open revealed word the
[53:39] book is open amen and we're here with
[53:41] all of this but we find ourselves
[53:43] defenseless then the enemy would just
[53:46] come as it would be and roll across the
[53:48] land again and again and again and we
[53:51] would just be as it were shamgar before
[53:54] Revelation shrunk him and so as it is to
[53:57] be defenseless in this day is also to
[54:01] say that you are going to be without
[54:04] victory if you have no defense against
[54:06] the spirit of laodicea then the spirit
[54:09] of laodicea will soon consume us just a
[54:13] little portion at a time it will come it
[54:16] will take away our confidence it will
[54:18] take away amen our Victory now there is
[54:21] ups and downs in life I think we could
[54:24] all say Amen to that there's life is not
[54:26] easy we are here with a word that God
[54:29] revealed in this hour through a prophet
[54:31] and in this realm we're seeing here that
[54:35] didn't suddenly make everything in this
[54:36] life easy Amen in fact sometimes because
[54:39] of our heart's desire to live the word
[54:41] we'll find ourselves almost in a
[54:44] constant battle in the world that we
[54:46] live in because there is all this
[54:48] influence around us all this wickedness
[54:51] around us that we have to face amen and
[54:55] so it's there that in these ups and
[54:57] downs of life it is a seeming a constant
[55:01] turmoil now my brother and sister we
[55:04] have to understand that what is
[55:06] happening around us does not define who
[55:09] we are and so when we talk about chaos
[55:12] and uncertainties and anxieties and all
[55:14] of these things of doubts and fears
[55:16] that's not who the bride of Christ is
[55:19] amen she is in a whole separate
[55:22] atmosphere but that atmosphere is
[55:25] influenced by this present world that we
[55:27] live in and so while there's constant
[55:30] turmoil if you don't think so I like to
[55:31] look at the news on the computer her
[55:33] every morning I usually just look for a
[55:36] moment to just kind of see and if we
[55:39] took what was in the news every single
[55:41] morning we would need to be in on some
[55:45] kind of anti-anxiety or some kind of
[55:48] medicine to to just calm our poor Hearts
[55:52] amen the word says that we're coming in
[55:54] a time that men's hearts are failing for
[55:56] fear and there is a underlying root of
[56:00] what is the uncertainty of tomorrow and
[56:03] I remember just watching a deal recently
[56:05] about Israel and they're interviewing
[56:08] people there in Israel and my brother
[56:10] and sister we're seeing even in that
[56:12] realm a dividing taking place you'll see
[56:16] that there are some that are standing
[56:18] there and they've experienced all kinds
[56:21] of experiences and they're saying oh no
[56:23] we fear for the state of Israel we fear
[56:27] for these people and we fear for our
[56:30] children's future but then you'll talk
[56:32] to another one and they will be there
[56:34] and they'll make a declaration you
[56:36] realize they've had some influence from
[56:38] you might say uh Christianity and they
[56:41] will stand there and say no God's in
[56:44] control no one can do anything to us but
[56:46] what God has it in his plan there's no
[56:49] terrorists there's no bombs there's no
[56:51] invasions there's nothing but what God
[56:54] has been aware of it from the beginning
[56:56] and so you'll see a divide where people
[56:59] in an uncertainty are almost afraid to
[57:02] leave their homes that something will
[57:04] happen and others who are looking and
[57:06] declaring my God's in control amen now
[57:09] this morning we get to decide which one
[57:12] of those we claim we can decide God's in
[57:15] control or we can be afraid of where the
[57:19] direction of our government is going and
[57:21] they're going to do this and they're
[57:22] going to do that and they're going to
[57:24] take this Liberty and they're going to
[57:26] take that Liberty well in this flesh we
[57:28] will see the government try to take or
[57:31] it will take a many things from the
[57:34] citizens as it were and you being a
[57:37] Christian a real Christian amen they
[57:39] never did mind the lukewarm amen they
[57:41] didn't mind the cold Christian at all
[57:43] but you being a real Christian you will
[57:46] be targeted but my brother and sister
[57:48] the word has already declared to you and
[57:51] I that we are not here to buy gold and
[57:54] bury it in the backyard we're not here
[57:56] to buy ammunition and bury it in the
[57:58] backyard we're not here to put up two or
[58:01] three or ten years supply of food in the
[58:03] backyard what we are here is to
[58:05] completely surrender to our King who
[58:08] said I am your defense I am the one who
[58:12] is going to take care of you because my
[58:15] brother and sister there's no amount of
[58:17] food amen the rats will find it somebody
[58:19] will find it it'll spoil whatever it
[58:22] might be your gold amen won't do any
[58:25] good imagine now it's going to go to
[58:27] Gold you need to buy gold if you ever
[58:29] listen to a radio there's 10 000 ads buy
[58:31] gold my brother and sister the first
[58:33] time you showed up at Albertsons and
[58:36] tried to carve off a chunk of gold to
[58:38] pay for your groceries you'd never make
[58:40] it to the parking lot
[58:42] especially when there's hungry people
[58:43] out there
[58:45] whose paper money isn't worth anything
[58:48] you see my brother and sister then we'd
[58:50] have to have an armored car parked out
[58:52] the door and then we would have to you
[58:54] know try to keep them from following us
[58:56] home oh no there's no end to this my
[58:58] brother and sister in the flesh we have
[59:00] no defense but in Christ amen we have
[59:04] Liberty we have one who has committed
[59:07] and said I am your defense and I will
[59:10] take care of you now that's all in the
[59:12] natural but look in the spiritual world
[59:14] there's many people even around the
[59:16] message that are afraid of being
[59:18] deceived and we'll look at this and
[59:20] realize if they just dig far enough in
[59:22] the message in other words not just
[59:24] gloss over the top if they'll dig in
[59:26] there you will realize my brother and
[59:28] sister as the prophet of God says you
[59:30] can't be deceived because you are the
[59:34] word
[59:34] my you can't be deceived if you're the
[59:37] word amen so what should we be doing not
[59:40] hiding in some bunker somewhere we
[59:43] should be in the word amen so that the
[59:45] word will be in US amen and so this
[59:48] whole world that's in turmoil amen Man
[59:52] by his very nature needs security
[59:57] we'll find security comes to Mankind in
[1:00:01] in various ways
[1:00:03] but we want to focus for just a moment
[1:00:05] by the nature of man God made us to need
[1:00:09] a sense of security or something very
[1:00:12] firm of security that to know that we're
[1:00:15] okay and some of this can be you know
[1:00:18] very hard and fixed some of this is just
[1:00:20] you might say a mirage amen now you'll
[1:00:25] find that Nations
[1:00:26] find a security in having borders that
[1:00:30] they can clearly put a line Amen brother
[1:00:33] Jeremy sister Emily living there the
[1:00:35] borders right there where they're at
[1:00:36] they deal with it Amen brother Jake he
[1:00:39] lives up there he deals with that border
[1:00:41] amen we we like it our way and that is
[1:00:44] the border of Oregon is right over here
[1:00:46] and I can drive over it just like that
[1:00:50] they have to go through the routine now
[1:00:53] the reason is these nations feel like
[1:00:55] they're secure by having this line and
[1:00:58] having something that stops on the
[1:01:00] highway maybe they check your
[1:01:01] credentials your passports Etc that
[1:01:04] makes them feel secure but the truth of
[1:01:06] it is in a natural sense their security
[1:01:08] is a false security because it is a very
[1:01:12] porous a line that that many things pass
[1:01:15] through and and do you know it is
[1:01:18] becoming more and more critical you know
[1:01:20] or more technical I should say that
[1:01:22] they're doing but my brother and sister
[1:01:24] there's a sense of security by having a
[1:01:27] defined border amen I know there's
[1:01:29] portions of Montana and North Dakota
[1:01:31] that there is only a little marker there
[1:01:34] telling you you are entering the United
[1:01:36] States or you are entering Canada
[1:01:37] there's no one there to defend it amen
[1:01:41] so you see the idea that we have to
[1:01:44] defend a border to feel secure is is a
[1:01:48] very earthy thing amen now you look at
[1:01:51] this and the armies that defend these
[1:01:54] borders gives you and I a sense of
[1:01:56] security we have an army defending this
[1:01:58] but you only have to go down to Nogales
[1:02:01] and some of these kind of places to
[1:02:03] realize that the armies are not doing a
[1:02:05] very good job defending it because you
[1:02:08] see my brother and sister the prophecy
[1:02:10] of the word will come to pass no matter
[1:02:12] how hard the governments of this Earth
[1:02:14] try to defend it amen try to change it
[1:02:17] that can't stop the word of God and so
[1:02:20] as it is we have homes you go to bed at
[1:02:23] night now get this my brother and sister
[1:02:25] I don't want to have anybody get nervous
[1:02:27] but we go to bed at night we walk around
[1:02:29] the house we lock the door
[1:02:32] and leave our bedroom window open for a
[1:02:34] nice breeze
[1:02:36] but we feel secure
[1:02:40] we go away
[1:02:42] and we lock up our house and we're
[1:02:44] comfortable because we lock the doors
[1:02:48] when
[1:02:50] well I won't go into the various methods
[1:02:52] but you can be inside of a house
[1:02:55] in about one minute
[1:02:59] and hardly leave a sign that you entered
[1:03:02] that's not for us common people there's
[1:03:04] another class of citizen
[1:03:08] but as you look at this see we have
[1:03:10] really in reality locks on the doors
[1:03:12] latches on the Windows is a false sense
[1:03:15] of security
[1:03:17] but we do feel secure
[1:03:20] and we feel secure inside that home
[1:03:23] we feel comfortable in our home amen if
[1:03:26] we have truly made this house whatever
[1:03:27] it's made out of into a home we feel
[1:03:30] comfortable in that home
[1:03:32] amen that's why we're seeing the song
[1:03:34] this world is not my home God never
[1:03:36] intended for you and I to become
[1:03:38] comfortable here he didn't want us to
[1:03:40] feel secure here he wanted us to always
[1:03:43] have that little bit of a feeling
[1:03:44] there's something I'm missing there's
[1:03:47] something I need to find I need to go on
[1:03:49] now if that is misinterpreted people
[1:03:51] will feel like maybe I don't have the
[1:03:53] Holy Ghost because there's a yearning in
[1:03:55] me but what God is doing is keeping you
[1:03:57] and I from putting Roots down that will
[1:03:59] anchor Us in laodicea and then when we
[1:04:02] put those kind of roots down the things
[1:04:04] of this life become more important than
[1:04:06] our relationship with God and so as we
[1:04:09] have you know what they say the more you
[1:04:11] have the more you must take care of Amen
[1:04:13] so sometimes people say if I only had
[1:04:15] this and I had that my brother and
[1:04:17] sister it actually has its own burden
[1:04:19] that goes with it amen so as you look at
[1:04:23] this you'll see that the denominational
[1:04:25] Christian
[1:04:26] my brother and sister brother Brown
[1:04:28] never was against the people in those
[1:04:30] denominations and we should be real
[1:04:31] careful that we don't look at that and
[1:04:34] make fun or mock of the people that are
[1:04:36] in there but what has happened is is
[1:04:39] because they've never been shown the
[1:04:41] open Word and realize that truly Christ
[1:04:44] is their only defense and that what do
[1:04:46] they do they fall back to the
[1:04:48] denomination if there's a question about
[1:04:50] anything you witness to them and you can
[1:04:52] clearly show them in scripture but yet
[1:04:55] because they're insecure where they
[1:04:57] stand because they've always stood in
[1:04:59] the shadow of their Church
[1:05:01] my brother and sister are the worst
[1:05:03] thing that you can do Grace is to stand
[1:05:05] in the shadow of the church and feel
[1:05:07] like that's going to make everything
[1:05:08] good for you God called for you to come
[1:05:11] and to walk in the light and to seek
[1:05:14] Revelation and be able to stand on the
[1:05:16] word the ministry the church is only
[1:05:18] here as a support to you it is not who
[1:05:22] you are and it's not there to form you
[1:05:25] it's the cry Life of Christ in you is
[1:05:28] what is intended to form you amen and to
[1:05:32] make you who God wants you to be so the
[1:05:34] denominational Christian finds Security
[1:05:37] in their denomination remember brother
[1:05:40] branham's there he's in the hospital and
[1:05:42] you know they're upset with him praying
[1:05:45] and you know their response I'll have
[1:05:47] you to know my brother and sister it's
[1:05:50] got nothing to do with it
[1:05:52] but the problem is we're seeing that
[1:05:54] creep into the message where we say well
[1:05:56] I've been in the message our family's
[1:05:58] been in the message or I was this or
[1:06:01] raised in the message none of that even
[1:06:02] matters one drop amen it's the
[1:06:05] relationship that we have with Jesus
[1:06:08] Christ is the only thing we can measure
[1:06:11] our security by but if we're not careful
[1:06:14] we will fall into that atmosphere that
[1:06:16] Spirit of laodicea that would come and
[1:06:19] we'll find security in the fact that our
[1:06:22] families always been in the message
[1:06:26] well I'll tell you what maybe we ought
[1:06:27] to change our vocabulary my family has
[1:06:30] been in Christ
[1:06:31] amen and let that be what we measure
[1:06:34] this by
[1:06:35] because you see now I'm not I'm not
[1:06:37] cutting down anything about recognizing
[1:06:40] that God is multi-generational right he
[1:06:43] runs down family lines that it's good to
[1:06:46] look out and see families it was kind of
[1:06:48] fun here recently to listen to The Dean
[1:06:51] Hart family interacting with people and
[1:06:53] how is so and so there you know not this
[1:06:55] and they're married to them and they
[1:06:56] were related to that and they could have
[1:06:57] cousin back there I just stood to the
[1:06:59] side and said wow I have no such
[1:07:00] testimony
[1:07:02] I have no such story to tell
[1:07:06] people are like oh do you know so and so
[1:07:09] never even heard the name before who oh
[1:07:12] their family's known in the message
[1:07:14] well I don't know maybe they stopped to
[1:07:16] the Mississippi
[1:07:17] I don't know if they ever came West or
[1:07:19] not I don't know or else they just flew
[1:07:21] over our head but we don't know them
[1:07:24] but I know one thing is the prophet of
[1:07:26] God said and they accused him of not
[1:07:28] knowing his Bible and he says okay I
[1:07:30] might not know my Bible I'm paraphrasing
[1:07:32] I might not know my Bible very well but
[1:07:35] I do know the author amen and that's
[1:07:38] what was a matter right there is they
[1:07:41] were looking at the book by memorizing
[1:07:44] the book they felt like they had it but
[1:07:46] when you know the author amen I've just
[1:07:50] read a little deal like that just here
[1:07:51] recently and it was talking about how
[1:07:54] this guy doing this research decided
[1:07:56] I'll be bold I'll go interview some of
[1:07:58] these authors of these best-selling
[1:07:59] books and so as he he was going to go
[1:08:02] interview them he thought you know what
[1:08:04] I don't want to come there and look
[1:08:06] ignorant so he bought each one of those
[1:08:09] books and read them right before he went
[1:08:11] to interview the author and he found
[1:08:14] some very profound things and so he's
[1:08:16] talking to these authors and he asks one
[1:08:19] of them I happen to be a lady and he
[1:08:21] asked her now you make this little
[1:08:23] reference in your story and and I just
[1:08:27] feel like there's something there and
[1:08:29] the author's like well as a matter of
[1:08:31] fact there is
[1:08:32] you see that was based on this
[1:08:35] experience that my aunt and uncle had
[1:08:38] back in this time period
[1:08:41] and I just kind of fictionalized it and
[1:08:44] brought it into this story
[1:08:48] oh my brother and sister if we could
[1:08:49] just sense that reading the Bible is not
[1:08:51] just a story but it's got something real
[1:08:54] and it's not fictionalized and it's
[1:08:56] brought down for you and I to be able to
[1:08:59] take a holds of it and I'm going to
[1:09:00] bring it a step further this message the
[1:09:02] prophet of God sharing some of these
[1:09:04] little stories some of these little
[1:09:06] things that happened people were like
[1:09:07] well what's the relevance of that he was
[1:09:09] trying to convey that there's something
[1:09:12] deeper than what's on the surface and
[1:09:14] only the bride of Christ is going to be
[1:09:16] you know they say well you want to read
[1:09:18] between the lines well I don't know why
[1:09:19] people I don't know how somebody in the
[1:09:22] message can argue against the fact of
[1:09:23] reading between the lines when the
[1:09:25] prophet of God says this little bride is
[1:09:27] going to take this word and she's going
[1:09:29] to read between the lines of this love
[1:09:31] letter
[1:09:33] and it's in that realm right there that
[1:09:35] the word becomes real to us because then
[1:09:37] it's no longer just a story but we
[1:09:40] become engaged we become part of that
[1:09:43] story and I say Lord help us today to be
[1:09:45] engaged amen so it's there my brother
[1:09:49] and sister
[1:09:51] as Christians
[1:09:53] Believers however you want to turn it
[1:09:55] turn it as Christians we've been given a
[1:09:58] place a shelter in a time of trouble we
[1:10:00] sing the song the name of the Lord is a
[1:10:03] strong tower now my brother and sister
[1:10:05] there's many that speak the name of
[1:10:07] Jesus Christ that have no security
[1:10:10] they have no place from their anxiety
[1:10:12] they have no place from the Troubles of
[1:10:14] Life they have no release of the cares
[1:10:17] of life but my brother and sister will
[1:10:19] look at this and realize what God wanted
[1:10:21] you and I to do now if we have sister
[1:10:23] Emily's a nurse amen and sister April
[1:10:27] being a doctor not here today but you
[1:10:29] know we have need of that anybody you
[1:10:31] know that doesn't think they have need
[1:10:32] of those kind of things as as needs to
[1:10:35] stop and go back and see what the
[1:10:37] prophet said you know when I about tore
[1:10:39] my right leg off years ago uh it
[1:10:41] wouldn't matter my brother and sister
[1:10:43] other than an outright touch of the Lord
[1:10:45] it wouldn't have mattered I could have
[1:10:46] walked around and I could have done that
[1:10:48] and I could have fell down in the
[1:10:49] grocery store I could have fell down at
[1:10:50] the park I could have fell down almost
[1:10:52] everywhere I still find it humorous my
[1:10:55] kids when I'd be in the grocery store
[1:10:56] and my knee would come out of joint and
[1:10:59] I would lay down on the floor and start
[1:11:00] moving my leg around you look around my
[1:11:02] kids weren't anywhere to be found
[1:11:05] no sir they'd be down the aisle with the
[1:11:07] Cheerios mm-hmm
[1:11:09] they had no desire for Cheerios they
[1:11:12] just didn't want to be identified with
[1:11:13] this guy flopping on the floor trying to
[1:11:15] put his leg back in joint
[1:11:17] now my brother and sister when we
[1:11:19] realized that God has an answer
[1:11:23] what I need right now this morning I
[1:11:25] need a medic
[1:11:27] I need a medic desperately this morning
[1:11:30] but there's no natural medic going to
[1:11:33] fix the wounds and the needs and the
[1:11:35] cares of my life and if I place my trust
[1:11:38] only in this then my brother and sister
[1:11:41] I would be a man most miserable but I
[1:11:44] have a God who hears my prayer can you
[1:11:46] say Amen here's my prayer and he knows
[1:11:50] my heart and he knows the thoughts of my
[1:11:52] mind and he is on the scene all the time
[1:11:56] amen you don't get up this line is busy
[1:12:00] but you've got a god that is caring and
[1:12:03] he's here to defend you
[1:12:08] you see we've been given this place this
[1:12:11] shelter
[1:12:13] where is it at my brother and sister
[1:12:15] where's this shelter
[1:12:20] the word
[1:12:22] there's our shelter
[1:12:25] there is no place on this Earth no bomb
[1:12:27] shelter no Financial tax shelter
[1:12:30] can I interest you on some
[1:12:33] I have a tax shelter you guys give me
[1:12:35] all your money I'll shelter it somewhere
[1:12:38] no that's not the world that we were
[1:12:40] called to live in
[1:12:42] they could take every dime from us my
[1:12:44] brother and sister but our faith in
[1:12:46] Jesus Christ will not waver because
[1:12:48] they've taken our possession
[1:12:50] they can come they can even take the
[1:12:53] very breath of this body and they
[1:12:55] believe they have accomplished something
[1:12:57] that the prophet of God brought such
[1:12:59] Clarity that death only offers us amen
[1:13:02] God uses there to harness us down to
[1:13:05] take us into the presence of God it
[1:13:07] would be almost as it were for those
[1:13:10] Apostles and those men stand before them
[1:13:12] Stephen if he had had it in those words
[1:13:15] could have said thank you for sending me
[1:13:18] into the presence of God
[1:13:20] that would have staggered their minds
[1:13:23] now it has staggered their thoughts that
[1:13:25] he would be there praising them thanking
[1:13:27] them for doing what they were doing
[1:13:29] because they were sure they were
[1:13:31] silencing that voice but my brother and
[1:13:33] sister Stephen's voice never stopped
[1:13:37] sounding
[1:13:40] now if you just give me a bit of Liberty
[1:13:43] this morning
[1:13:44] I believe quite possibly
[1:13:46] the Apostle Paul
[1:13:48] said that he had a thorn in his flesh
[1:13:50] now they put it to physical things they
[1:13:53] put it to other things but just bear
[1:13:55] with me for a moment what if the Apostle
[1:13:57] Paul's thorn in his flesh was the echo
[1:14:01] of the voices
[1:14:03] of the Believers that he put to death
[1:14:10] in the Dark Ages there's a recorded
[1:14:12] event of History
[1:14:14] of a man quite wealthy
[1:14:17] had become a Secret believer and someone
[1:14:19] had then revealed him to the authorities
[1:14:22] and they took him down
[1:14:24] and they tie him and they're going to
[1:14:26] burn him at the stake and they're
[1:14:27] pleading with him all you have to do is
[1:14:30] recant
[1:14:32] you've got a nice house you've got land
[1:14:34] you've got servants you've got money
[1:14:35] Jeffrey Canton live life and under the
[1:14:39] sway of that influence he recounts
[1:14:43] and all night long he's troubled
[1:14:46] and in the morning he rises early
[1:14:49] and goes down where they're preparing to
[1:14:51] burn Christians at the stake
[1:14:54] and says I recant
[1:14:57] my recante what would be the right word
[1:15:00] I don't want to put that to English I
[1:15:02] recant that I'm rejecting what I told
[1:15:05] you yesterday and they went to bind him
[1:15:08] to the post and he says you don't need
[1:15:10] to bind me to the post I will stand here
[1:15:13] they piled the wood up around him they
[1:15:15] light it on fire it's the last time
[1:15:18] according to history that they allowed
[1:15:20] that to happen not tying someone to the
[1:15:22] post because as the Flames come up
[1:15:24] around him his hands went up and they
[1:15:27] could hear his voice praising God
[1:15:31] my brother and sister where is the fear
[1:15:34] in that in this flesh there's fear in
[1:15:38] Christ our defense there's liberty to be
[1:15:41] able to praise God after that they were
[1:15:43] so haunted by his hands being raised and
[1:15:46] the last that they hear of his voice is
[1:15:49] him praising God that from that day on
[1:15:51] they chained them to the Post
[1:15:58] is our flesh that strong
[1:16:01] I'll tell you right now my flesh isn't
[1:16:08] but In Christ Alone
[1:16:12] and Christ Alone
[1:16:14] amen
[1:16:17] you see I've heard I've talked to
[1:16:19] Believers in the last while
[1:16:22] that expressed anxiety about what is
[1:16:24] coming
[1:16:26] what will they do to us brother Paul or
[1:16:28] what will happen
[1:16:29] my brother and sister what we really
[1:16:31] need to do is say you know what I have a
[1:16:33] defense
[1:16:34] burn this body drown this body throw
[1:16:36] this body off a cliff do whatever you
[1:16:37] want with this body this body's not me
[1:16:40] but in the human element we value the
[1:16:42] body so much that we want to defend the
[1:16:45] body amen and I'm not talking about hey
[1:16:47] look the Lord takes me home I'll just
[1:16:49] eat all the Snickers and Mountain Dew
[1:16:51] that I want and that'll just take me
[1:16:52] home so no if you suffer from that
[1:16:54] behavior then that was put upon by
[1:16:57] yourself not by God Amen you know so you
[1:17:00] can't you can't uh brother Donnie Reagan
[1:17:03] once said it ain't going to do any good
[1:17:04] to sit on the couch
[1:17:07] and eat that bag of potato chips and say
[1:17:10] Lord take away all the harmful effects
[1:17:13] you can eat only potato chips and soda
[1:17:15] pop you'll deal with the issues of
[1:17:17] potato chips and soda pop my brother and
[1:17:20] sister now God can heal you from that
[1:17:21] but he never wanted you to inflict that
[1:17:24] upon yourself in the beginning amen that
[1:17:26] is my health lesson of the day amen now
[1:17:30] so what happens
[1:17:32] is God setting us in place that the word
[1:17:34] has become our only shelter our only
[1:17:37] safety
[1:17:38] remember I don't know this won't apply
[1:17:40] to all of you so forgive me but remember
[1:17:42] when many of us first come into the
[1:17:44] message or it really started to get real
[1:17:46] to us
[1:17:47] we looked at that and we thought but I
[1:17:49] can't live without this
[1:17:51] and I can't live without that
[1:17:58] and somewhere along the line
[1:18:01] it left yeah
[1:18:03] we might not even be able to pinpoint
[1:18:05] the day
[1:18:06] and the time
[1:18:10] I remember one time being part of a
[1:18:11] conversation and brothers and and
[1:18:13] certainly I'm the one that felt
[1:18:15] inadequate I'm the one that felt the
[1:18:16] little complex and these brothers are
[1:18:19] and they're like wouldn't you get the
[1:18:19] Holy Ghost well we were in these
[1:18:21] meetings in 1976 and and I was sitting
[1:18:24] there and brother so and so was
[1:18:25] preaching in the tent and and it was
[1:18:27] there and I got the Holy Ghost and
[1:18:28] another brother yeah you know praise God
[1:18:30] yeah I was here brother so and so on
[1:18:32] these services in this deal right here
[1:18:34] and you know when the brother laid his
[1:18:35] hand on my back and said Lord fill him
[1:18:37] with the Holy Ghost something changed in
[1:18:39] me and it gets to me and I just Mom I
[1:18:42] kind of
[1:18:48] I can't pinpoint the day
[1:18:51] little by little he's changing
[1:18:56] changing man changing me I look at those
[1:19:00] Brothers I'm almost like envious is that
[1:19:02] okay to talk this Frank almost like
[1:19:04] envious these brothers can like pinpoint
[1:19:07] it to a time this camp meeting these
[1:19:09] special services this time in the tent
[1:19:11] this brother praying and they can
[1:19:13] pinpoint it to that and their lives show
[1:19:15] that they truly have the Holy Ghost and
[1:19:17] I'm over here going oh my little by
[1:19:19] little Lord little by little I still am
[1:19:22] still being changed and still lord it's
[1:19:24] doing and you know then you want to
[1:19:26] preach on stubbornness and realize that
[1:19:28] you know somebody in the church might
[1:19:29] think you're preaching about them when
[1:19:31] really you're preaching about yourself
[1:19:33] you know that happens more than you
[1:19:35] think
[1:19:36] the church is like man the pastor was
[1:19:38] sure hard on us today or the minister
[1:19:40] will sure hard on us and the preacher
[1:19:42] goes home and says man Lord you were
[1:19:44] sure hard on me
[1:19:47] don't be too rash to judge you don't
[1:19:50] know what God's dealing
[1:19:52] amen
[1:19:53] so where do you and I find security
[1:19:56] we've already said the word let's make
[1:19:58] it more personal
[1:20:00] the husband by God's design finds
[1:20:03] security
[1:20:05] in the presence of his wife
[1:20:09] there's a comfort factor
[1:20:12] sometimes I'm just secure I just put it
[1:20:14] real blunt to you I'm just secure
[1:20:17] knowing my wife is in the house
[1:20:22] she's like well
[1:20:24] you're not talking to me or you didn't
[1:20:26] and I'm negligent on that Lord help me
[1:20:30] but I have this security my wife is just
[1:20:33] right there around the corner
[1:20:36] and many a wife finds that security
[1:20:39] knowing
[1:20:40] my husband's in the house
[1:20:43] he's here
[1:20:44] and if I need him he's right there
[1:20:46] available to me so take those and
[1:20:49] spiritualize them and you'll realize
[1:20:50] what is happening God has put this
[1:20:53] nature in us to find security in the
[1:20:56] presence of our bridegroom
[1:20:58] when we are in the presence of our
[1:21:01] husband we feel secure amen so we don't
[1:21:04] have to be running around the house now
[1:21:06] hear me you know have to be running
[1:21:08] around the house praise God I got a
[1:21:10] husband
[1:21:12] he's in the room
[1:21:14] you don't have to be saying husband will
[1:21:16] you keep me safe he's in the room
[1:21:21] are you with me I don't want to belabor
[1:21:23] this too long
[1:21:25] now my brother and sister what it is is
[1:21:27] when we have come in the presence of our
[1:21:29] bridegroom
[1:21:30] something is anchored in the soul
[1:21:33] at this speaking now when does marriage
[1:21:35] take place
[1:21:37] something that ought to be taught a
[1:21:38] little bit more in the message is that
[1:21:40] marriage doesn't take place when that
[1:21:42] young man and that young woman are at
[1:21:43] the altar up here and they say I do and
[1:21:45] then they kiss and and they go out now
[1:21:47] they're married my brother and sister it
[1:21:49] comes right down to the relationship
[1:21:51] with our bridegroom Jesus Christ that
[1:21:54] the prophet taught us that the marriage
[1:21:57] takes place at the commitment
[1:22:00] so that's been a problem around the
[1:22:02] message I'll just be blunt is there's
[1:22:03] been many a young couple said oh will
[1:22:05] you marry me yes I'll marry you and then
[1:22:07] they go off and something happens they
[1:22:09] go different ways and they don't realize
[1:22:11] that they've actually put themselves
[1:22:12] under a vow or a commitment and there it
[1:22:16] is that they just go off and it's a
[1:22:17] whole different person different
[1:22:18] situation and they don't even know any
[1:22:20] different because no one has bothered to
[1:22:23] teach them
[1:22:24] but my brother and sister I want you to
[1:22:26] know looking at it from the spiritual
[1:22:28] side that when we come as Sons and
[1:22:30] Daughters of God and we take the thou
[1:22:33] Lord I will serve you I love you Lord he
[1:22:37] didn't say now when you are like this
[1:22:39] and when you are like that have you ever
[1:22:41] noticed that every girl that gets
[1:22:42] married goes on a diet
[1:22:46] maybe not every girl some of them
[1:22:47] already skinny
[1:22:50] and some just don't care
[1:22:53] but it's a trend
[1:22:54] you see it all the time
[1:22:56] Jerry's like oh my goodness where is my
[1:22:59] husband going
[1:23:01] but my brother and sister God doesn't
[1:23:03] wait to accept or vow after we have
[1:23:06] changed
[1:23:08] we don't have to get skinny we don't
[1:23:10] have to be perfect we don't have to this
[1:23:12] amen you give the vow God says I accept
[1:23:16] it you're mine
[1:23:17] amen so it's in that place we can find
[1:23:20] our security and I brought up brother
[1:23:23] Bud Southwick the other day I'll bring
[1:23:24] him up again brother Branham didn't say
[1:23:26] Bud you're not going to get the Holy
[1:23:28] Ghost until you get over that smoking
[1:23:30] and if you don't this and if you don't
[1:23:32] that bud no what did he do he just spoke
[1:23:34] those words which were the right words
[1:23:36] in the right time brother bud when did
[1:23:38] you quit smoking and he says right now
[1:23:40] brother Branham brother Branham doesn't
[1:23:42] say well we'll just see
[1:23:45] why because he recognized that bud
[1:23:47] Southwick had just now taken a vow to
[1:23:50] God and God was the one who would
[1:23:52] fulfill that vow so it's there in that
[1:23:54] realm we'll find that security you can
[1:23:58] stand on it you can you can remain very
[1:24:01] secure in that amen and somebody stole
[1:24:04] the time again this Sunday
[1:24:06] in the seven Church ages Ephesian Church
[1:24:08] Aid now I brought this up the other day
[1:24:12] I don't remember if I read the quote or
[1:24:13] I I just mentioned it but brother Brown
[1:24:16] says right here in Ephesian Church Aid
[1:24:20] someone's going to ask me this question
[1:24:22] did God tell Eve to watch out for the
[1:24:25] serpent or their serpent would seduce
[1:24:27] her
[1:24:28] hmm
[1:24:29] can you find that in your Bible
[1:24:31] no you can't now listen God didn't have
[1:24:34] to say one thing about what would happen
[1:24:36] just get the point of the story
[1:24:39] he simply gave the word he said not to
[1:24:43] partake of knowledge
[1:24:45] partake of life life was the word of God
[1:24:49] death was anything that wasn't the word
[1:24:52] of God
[1:24:54] now my brother and sister we're coming
[1:24:55] to a stage in the message at this
[1:24:57] metamorphosis of time we talk about
[1:24:59] Revelation talk about reading between
[1:25:01] the lines people are reading between the
[1:25:03] lines so far that they're saying well
[1:25:05] now brother Brown says this this and
[1:25:07] this here and that means this this and
[1:25:09] this and my brother and sister this this
[1:25:10] and this over here is contrary to the
[1:25:12] written word of God and they say well
[1:25:14] but brother Branham said it well I'm
[1:25:16] telling you you have made a mistake in
[1:25:18] how you interpreted what the prophet
[1:25:20] said because the prophet is subject to
[1:25:23] the word himself and Paul said if they
[1:25:26] change even one word
[1:25:28] so if that's the case and brother Brown
[1:25:30] actually changed it we're following a
[1:25:32] false message
[1:25:33] but we're not
[1:25:35] we have the revealed word of the hour
[1:25:36] it's man's interpretation of the word so
[1:25:41] what is it coming here amen God didn't
[1:25:43] have to say one thing right
[1:25:45] don't partake of knowledge partake of
[1:25:48] life and life was the word of God Amen
[1:25:51] death was anything that wasn't
[1:25:54] my one word
[1:25:57] just change one word
[1:25:59] she allowed one word to be changed and
[1:26:02] right then Satan had her God could have
[1:26:04] said don't pick more fruit off the trees
[1:26:06] than you can eat Satan would say look
[1:26:08] that's quite right you see if you pick
[1:26:10] too much food it will rot but here is a
[1:26:12] method of preserving the fruit it's
[1:26:15] called denominationalism and let the
[1:26:17] same time and at the same time you can
[1:26:19] pick all you want see how Satan's so
[1:26:22] clever he comes along and he just makes
[1:26:24] it so natural it makes so much sense hmm
[1:26:28] that's why this message my brother and
[1:26:30] sister should not be a Doctrine it
[1:26:33] should be a life amen because doctrines
[1:26:35] can be argued and over time doctrines
[1:26:38] can shift but if you have life
[1:26:42] you know there's artificial life support
[1:26:46] but you've never seen a person on
[1:26:48] artificial
[1:26:51] little frog in my throat
[1:26:54] you've never seen a person on
[1:26:56] artificial or life support get up and
[1:26:59] live life
[1:27:01] they're confined
[1:27:03] that's right they're right there
[1:27:04] something's pumping their blood some
[1:27:06] things breathing something's doing that
[1:27:08] my brother and sister there's nothing
[1:27:11] artificial in God's life
[1:27:14] God's life is the original life
[1:27:16] amen see you can have your way
[1:27:20] this is what Satan's trying to Peddle
[1:27:22] this you get this in context uh Satan's
[1:27:25] throwing this thought out see you can
[1:27:26] have your way and God's way at the same
[1:27:28] time
[1:27:29] boy that's what the devil would like the
[1:27:31] Christian world to believe today that we
[1:27:34] can have our way and God's way and those
[1:27:38] things creep in my brother and sister
[1:27:39] remember if the boat's in the water the
[1:27:41] water will be in the boat and so if we
[1:27:44] are here in this world which is
[1:27:46] controlled by a denominational Spirit
[1:27:48] which is the Antichrist then that means
[1:27:51] that you and I will be buffeted by
[1:27:53] Antichrist Spirit now don't sit here and
[1:27:56] say oh my goodness I must be backsliding
[1:27:58] I'm I must be losing my understanding my
[1:28:00] love for the Lord uh what is it no my
[1:28:03] brother and sister throw the water out
[1:28:05] of the boat that's all you got to do you
[1:28:07] just gotta stop and say Satan that's not
[1:28:09] the word that's not who I am I don't
[1:28:12] accept that but if we let it go my
[1:28:15] brother and sister I was just reading
[1:28:16] about a boat pretty good sized boat off
[1:28:18] the coast of Florida they literally took
[1:28:21] the boat out that morning knowing that
[1:28:23] they had a propeller shaft seal that was
[1:28:27] leaking water
[1:28:29] but we're not going to be gone in this
[1:28:31] world long enough for that to be a
[1:28:34] problem
[1:28:35] I know that there's things wrong and I'm
[1:28:39] not going to repent or I don't feel
[1:28:40] inclined to repent and everything will
[1:28:43] be fine we'll have the boat back in and
[1:28:45] on the trailer in just a couple hours
[1:28:47] this is a big boat surely there can't be
[1:28:49] that much water get in the boat
[1:28:52] until it went glub Club
[1:28:56] you see that sounds silly
[1:28:59] I don't want to vote with you
[1:29:01] if you think that water running in the
[1:29:03] boat is okay
[1:29:06] I don't want to hang out with you don't
[1:29:08] offer me an all-day fishing trip off the
[1:29:10] coast all expenses paid if the boat is
[1:29:13] leaking water
[1:29:17] you can have your way in God's way at
[1:29:18] the same time the devil would have her
[1:29:21] right there he is that guilty in one
[1:29:23] point he that is guilty in one point of
[1:29:26] the law has broken the whole law
[1:29:28] don't fool with that word
[1:29:32] amen amen don't you like that I like
[1:29:35] that you say brother Paul we know that
[1:29:36] we know that that's right I'm just here
[1:29:39] to stir up your pure Minds in
[1:29:41] remembrance
[1:29:43] we don't have to have some new startling
[1:29:45] Revelation out of the word
[1:29:47] every time we come to church sometimes
[1:29:50] we just need reminded
[1:29:55] wouldn't that be awesome Brothers
[1:29:57] if every day when we came home from work
[1:30:00] our wives had just cooked up some new
[1:30:03] absolutely
[1:30:06] fascinating incredible meal
[1:30:11] labored over the stove for Endless hours
[1:30:14] every day to watch us wipe it out in 10
[1:30:16] minutes
[1:30:18] and they were so inspired that every day
[1:30:20] they did that
[1:30:21] but wait
[1:30:24] there are certain things
[1:30:26] I dislike
[1:30:30] there are certain things I
[1:30:32] I don't want
[1:30:36] a little secret communication here
[1:30:42] I don't need
[1:30:44] some of my meals with some new spice
[1:30:47] from Ceylon
[1:30:50] and I don't need cilantro on everything
[1:30:52] I eat
[1:30:54] and I don't want this and that
[1:30:58] sometimes
[1:30:59] just give me the original
[1:31:01] that is throw that stake on there sear
[1:31:05] it on that side sear it on that side jab
[1:31:08] it with a fork and if it doesn't go moo
[1:31:11] put it on the plate I'm ready for it
[1:31:14] and I could eat that about five times a
[1:31:16] week
[1:31:17] just give me the original
[1:31:20] but what is the nature of man
[1:31:23] we went to a restaurant sometime back
[1:31:26] and the waiter is just like well and
[1:31:28] this is
[1:31:29] and I'm sitting there I'm feeling very
[1:31:32] inadequate
[1:31:33] but I was like man I can't even order
[1:31:34] off this menu I don't even know what
[1:31:36] they're talking about I finally look up
[1:31:37] at the guy what is this
[1:31:40] he looks down at me
[1:31:42] little expression across his face
[1:31:46] you would call it mashed potatoes with
[1:31:48] garlic
[1:31:51] thank you sir
[1:31:53] that's what I like mashed potatoes with
[1:31:56] garlic
[1:31:57] not well anyway
[1:32:01] so
[1:32:05] to some
[1:32:06] the confines of the word are too
[1:32:09] restrictive
[1:32:10] we've all met those people that are like
[1:32:12] no no the message message is law it's
[1:32:15] legalism it is well I'd like to
[1:32:18] introduce them to real legalism my
[1:32:20] brother and sister if they think this
[1:32:21] message is legalism but here's the thing
[1:32:24] that's scary is while they're standing
[1:32:26] there saying the message is too
[1:32:28] confining for me Satan's right there if
[1:32:31] you can Envision him right on the side
[1:32:33] top on the shoulder hey I've got some
[1:32:35] Liberty for you
[1:32:37] but what they don't understand is
[1:32:39] Satan's version of Liberty takes you
[1:32:42] right back amen it was a Garden Eden
[1:32:44] kind of Liberty amen he's going to spice
[1:32:46] up their life with a Garden of Eden type
[1:32:49] Liberty that gives him now my brothers
[1:32:52] and sisters this little blood block
[1:32:53] bride she's she's sitting here she just
[1:32:56] wants to serve God and uh she's just
[1:32:58] there and we seem so old-fashioned I had
[1:33:01] someone recently you know go now Paul
[1:33:03] you know it seems like you have really
[1:33:04] nice people you know kind of your
[1:33:06] old-fashioned religion
[1:33:07] yes thank you Lord Give Me That Old Time
[1:33:11] religion give me that why they're
[1:33:13] looking for something new they're
[1:33:15] looking for something modern they're
[1:33:16] looking for uh the the flashing lights
[1:33:19] the dark sitting in they like to sit in
[1:33:21] the dark I just seen a picture here
[1:33:23] recently hope I'm not boring you but
[1:33:25] I've seen a picture who recently taken
[1:33:27] in a mega church and the lights are down
[1:33:29] low and there's people watching
[1:33:31] basketball football and soccer during
[1:33:34] church oh we were so blessed to be in
[1:33:35] church today you know got their phones
[1:33:37] they're up in the balcony and they're
[1:33:39] like yes but amen
[1:33:44] no they're they're watching sports
[1:33:47] my brother and sister but they'll tell
[1:33:49] you I was in church today
[1:33:52] no you were in a building today my
[1:33:54] brother and sister the prophet of God
[1:33:55] called it a lodge
[1:33:57] amen so what happens is see we can't
[1:34:00] have let's just get this straight we
[1:34:02] can't have our way and God's way at the
[1:34:04] same time we have to stop and say Lord
[1:34:07] whatever your will is
[1:34:09] amen
[1:34:10] so
[1:34:14] we'll just quit here in just a moment
[1:34:17] there is a saying and this is how I
[1:34:19] heard it others might have heard it
[1:34:21] slightly different but it used to be
[1:34:23] around individually used to say this
[1:34:26] saying pretty regular those who would
[1:34:28] give up freedom for security will have
[1:34:30] neither
[1:34:31] and that actually is a takeoff of what
[1:34:34] Benjamin's Franklin's quote was that
[1:34:36] those who would give up essential
[1:34:38] Liberty to purchase a little temporary
[1:34:42] safety deserve neither Liberty nor
[1:34:45] safety
[1:34:48] now let's put this into a church realm
[1:34:50] and these are my words might not be the
[1:34:52] most eloquent but I would say it like
[1:34:53] this those who would give up the word
[1:34:56] our safety to purchase a little
[1:34:58] temporary Liberty will have neither
[1:35:03] amen
[1:35:04] our Liberty I don't know about you
[1:35:06] Saints I believe I do I think I'll just
[1:35:07] go ahead and speak the positive can I
[1:35:09] speak the positive amen my brother and
[1:35:11] sister our Liberty is only found in the
[1:35:16] word
[1:35:17] now I'll back this up with this quote I
[1:35:21] don't like to normally quote other
[1:35:23] preachers as it were so much but look at
[1:35:27] this Charles Spurgeon says it this way
[1:35:29] it is where the spirit of the Lord is
[1:35:32] that there is liberty and nowhere else
[1:35:38] so people think they're finding Liberty
[1:35:40] by skirting The Edge my brother and
[1:35:43] sister oh it's exhilarating
[1:35:45] I'll tell you what we ought to go find
[1:35:48] that wall that brother Brown was talking
[1:35:51] about
[1:35:52] now bear with me we're talking
[1:35:53] figurative we'll find that wall of that
[1:35:56] Chariot driver who can drive that
[1:35:58] Chariot wheel
[1:36:00] right there
[1:36:03] in all reality how many of us would ride
[1:36:05] with him
[1:36:10] in the natural
[1:36:12] we're Brave we're bold we like
[1:36:14] excitement we climb mountains we hunt
[1:36:16] wild animals we do this we do that what
[1:36:20] are you doing driving over there get
[1:36:21] away from that that's my life
[1:36:24] but look what happens under this
[1:36:26] anointing of I want to serve god with
[1:36:29] some Liberty I want to just go right
[1:36:33] over here and I want to have half of my
[1:36:35] heel hanging off in laodicea at all
[1:36:38] times it's exhilarating
[1:36:45] can I make an admission
[1:36:47] I get embarrassed as all get out when
[1:36:50] brother George brought up the fact
[1:36:52] we went into a movie theater
[1:36:56] and watch the movie The Apostle Paul
[1:37:01] half the time I'm sitting there watching
[1:37:04] this very profound very moving
[1:37:07] movie
[1:37:09] and I doubt of sister Jerry noticed
[1:37:12] but I kept looking up towards the
[1:37:14] ceiling
[1:37:15] [Laughter]
[1:37:17] and the prophet's words echoing in my
[1:37:19] mind
[1:37:21] them demons
[1:37:22] are hanging around
[1:37:25] there now I want to ask you a question
[1:37:27] because the movie about the Apostle Paul
[1:37:30] was a movie expression of the word
[1:37:35] you think them demons were moved and
[1:37:37] left
[1:37:40] no
[1:37:45] now don't blame brother George
[1:37:49] don't blame bro it's yours
[1:37:52] I'm the one that said yes
[1:37:55] but you talk about being ashamed
[1:37:57] embarrassed and want to crawl underneath
[1:37:59] the rug you know brother George yeah I
[1:38:00] took brother Paul to the theater we
[1:38:01] watched the Apostle Paul and I'm you
[1:38:04] know really what I wanted to do is be
[1:38:05] able if I could to take my glasses and
[1:38:07] put them like this and see what all your
[1:38:09] Expressions were
[1:38:12] our pastor in a theater now this is
[1:38:15] years ago I've had plenty of repentance
[1:38:17] but you see my brother and sister that's
[1:38:19] what we want is the word to be ingrained
[1:38:22] in us enough that we don't callously say
[1:38:24] this one time of sinning
[1:38:27] this one time of this one time of that
[1:38:29] won't hurt me
[1:38:31] it affected me I'm just being open to
[1:38:33] you affected me enough that I still feel
[1:38:36] grieved to this day and here again don't
[1:38:38] blame brother George it was playing in
[1:38:40] the theater brother George says I've
[1:38:42] seen this video
[1:38:43] and it's so good it's playing right
[1:38:45] there let's go watch it
[1:38:48] don't blame brother George
[1:38:53] I blame myself
[1:38:55] that's all right it'll show up on a DVD
[1:38:58] and
[1:38:59] and uh
[1:39:00] if brother Trevor sister Cario buy it
[1:39:02] I'll borrow it I don't even have to
[1:39:04] spend any money
[1:39:08] but you see how that we come into these
[1:39:10] positions
[1:39:11] but what is our defense now I I'm I'm
[1:39:15] ashamed of myself and I want you to
[1:39:17] understand that but I know God has Grace
[1:39:19] and I was moved by that and and it had a
[1:39:22] profound effect on me and I've made a
[1:39:24] commitment that I don't care how many
[1:39:26] religious movies there are I'm not going
[1:39:28] back into that movie house with those
[1:39:31] demons hanging around on the balcony
[1:39:35] now if you don't mind going there that's
[1:39:37] fine that might be your Garden of Eden
[1:39:39] but it's not my Garden of Eden
[1:39:43] and I don't mean that horse and I don't
[1:39:45] mean that judgmental
[1:39:47] you see my brother and sister it's where
[1:39:48] the spirit of the Lord is is that
[1:39:50] there's liberty and if you're sitting in
[1:39:52] a theater watching a incredible
[1:39:54] religious movie looking at the balcony
[1:40:00] that's not Liberty
[1:40:03] and God has a way of correcting us
[1:40:07] and it's not as a harsh-handed father
[1:40:10] sometimes it's a love and correction
[1:40:13] I warned you
[1:40:15] I sent a prophet to tell you demons hang
[1:40:18] out in those places have no idea what
[1:40:21] played in that place before
[1:40:23] might have been something that I would
[1:40:25] have just been huh I would not go in
[1:40:27] there for nothing but then we'll walk in
[1:40:29] there because it's got a certain flavor
[1:40:32] the demons didn't leave seven sons of
[1:40:35] seba I won't go into a perfect example
[1:40:37] they could have went in there and said
[1:40:39] now this and this and this and this
[1:40:40] which really is what they did do
[1:40:42] because they had no truth behind their
[1:40:44] words
[1:40:46] Satan said huh damn I know but who are
[1:40:49] you
[1:40:50] well I want him to look and say well
[1:40:51] this is just mere mortal flesh but he's
[1:40:53] got the word in him and if I deal with
[1:40:55] him I'm dealing with the word and so
[1:40:58] I must listen
[1:41:06] I've got so much more
[1:41:08] I knew this was going to carry out too
[1:41:10] long
[1:41:11] Sister Sarah
[1:41:13] praise the Lord
[1:41:15] I don't know
[1:41:16] Ephesians 1 1-14 you can take some
[1:41:19] homework what you're going to see right
[1:41:21] there is I'll just end up preaching it
[1:41:23] to you anyway here but what you'll see
[1:41:26] see is is in verse 4 according as he has
[1:41:29] chosen Us in him before the foundation
[1:41:30] of the world that we should be holding
[1:41:32] Without Blame before him in love what is
[1:41:34] that that's Liberty
[1:41:35] see God's giving us these these you
[1:41:38] might say daily doses of Liberty through
[1:41:41] the word he's just pouring Liberty in US
[1:41:43] amen you might take a a drink of cough
[1:41:46] syrup or you might have some kind of
[1:41:48] liquid vitamin or something and you
[1:41:51] don't drink the whole bottle in one day
[1:41:53] right you take a drink as it were or you
[1:41:55] take that each and every day and it
[1:41:58] starts to have enough impact on you and
[1:42:00] here's God through the word I hope you
[1:42:02] can take this home and mull on this a
[1:42:04] little bit through the word God is
[1:42:06] putting Liberty in you and I you say
[1:42:08] well I need a revelation to see who I am
[1:42:11] no except the Liberty that's in the word
[1:42:13] already
[1:42:14] you don't have to have a great
[1:42:15] Revelation to find Liberty in the word
[1:42:18] and you will find that God as you dig in
[1:42:21] the word God will be there to defend
[1:42:23] your life for you
[1:42:24] amen we don't have to try to make our
[1:42:26] life something that it's not my I've got
[1:42:29] a whole bunch of other things here
[1:42:31] amen I do want to read presuming though
[1:42:35] amen
[1:42:39] and all those names that was before the
[1:42:41] foundation of the world predestinated
[1:42:43] all that the father has given me will
[1:42:45] come to me yes sir all that he foreknew
[1:42:49] he called all that he calls he justifies
[1:42:51] and those that is Justified he has
[1:42:53] glorified Paul according to Ephesians 1
[1:42:56] and that's why I had Ephesians 1 to kind
[1:42:58] of go into the explanation
[1:43:01] God predestinated us before the
[1:43:03] foundation of the world to the adoptions
[1:43:04] of sons in Jesus Christ how are you
[1:43:07] going to stop it
[1:43:09] I want to ask you Saints if God's called
[1:43:11] you I don't care what trouble we're
[1:43:14] going through God has called you how's
[1:43:18] the devil going to stop it
[1:43:21] because if he could stop it he would
[1:43:23] have stopped it a long time ago

[1:43:27] so what it is
[1:43:30] how are you going to stop it all devils

[1:45:41] Church Hallelujah God said I will
[1:45:43] restore restore what one without an
[1:45:46] organization to touch it one with the
[1:45:49] pure unadulterated word it has to come

[1:45:55] morning amen he is our defense my
[1:45:58] brother and sister the devil's doing
[1:45:59] everything he can to attack us he's
[1:46:02] trying to attack marriages he's trying
[1:46:03] to attack the parent-child relationship
[1:46:06] he's trying to attack the fellowship
[1:46:08] within the body of Believers he's trying
[1:46:10] to attack us on our approach to the word
[1:46:13] and my brother and sister nothing like
[1:46:15] having someone be told just go home
[1:46:18] before you get hurt
[1:46:20] devil
[1:46:22] back off
[1:46:24] I've got no time for you
[1:46:26] he's our defense
[1:46:28] amen my brothers and sisters
[1:46:31] I want to share one last little thing
[1:46:33] that I read I found quite interesting
[1:46:35] there was a ranch in Texas
[1:46:38] I don't know I can't pronounce really
[1:46:41] uh the the area
[1:46:43] [Music]
[1:46:46] like that
[1:46:48] in those days it was nothing out there
[1:46:52] and yet there were men took their wives
[1:46:54] their children
[1:46:55] cattle
[1:46:57] good grass they would go out there
[1:47:01] Brave or foolish depend on who you're
[1:47:03] talking about
[1:47:05] but the ones that survived
[1:47:08] were the ones that planned
[1:47:12] for the enemy to attack them
[1:47:14] in this case it was the Native Americans
[1:47:17] Comanches and Etc they planned on it
[1:47:19] they never thought well if they do or if
[1:47:22] they don't they said they're going to
[1:47:25] and they planned accordingly this story
[1:47:28] I read about is a ranch that still
[1:47:30] exists this day uh and uh
[1:47:33] they
[1:47:35] they drilled the well double oh well
[1:47:39] pretty soon realized that the Indians
[1:47:41] attack us we're going to be in our Stone
[1:47:43] House with a dirt roof that they can't
[1:47:45] light on fire but we'll have no water
[1:47:48] so this added on to the house until it
[1:47:50] encapsulated the well so now they've got
[1:47:53] Stone dirt water
[1:47:56] and then they said but if we
[1:47:58] we are in here and our horses are there
[1:48:02] they'll take all our horses and then
[1:48:04] we're in trouble also so they made
[1:48:07] provision for that and then they built
[1:48:09] another deal and they built a guard
[1:48:10] house and they built all these things
[1:48:12] and when the Indians would come
[1:48:14] and attack them
[1:48:16] they found that these people were so
[1:48:19] prepared the enemies it cost them too
[1:48:20] much
[1:48:21] they weren't out there scalping the men
[1:48:24] and women
[1:48:26] they were dying
[1:48:28] and the reason I want to share this to
[1:48:30] you God's given us ample opportunity
[1:48:34] we know the devil's going to attack us
[1:48:36] amen and he's given us his word that we
[1:48:39] can prepare ourselves and he's also
[1:48:42] given the word that sometimes in the
[1:48:43] preaching of the word we say well is is
[1:48:46] that in our church is that there no my
[1:48:48] brother and sister the devil's just
[1:48:49] waiting to introduce anything he can
[1:48:51] introduce to cause chaos it isn't that
[1:48:54] we start looking over our shoulder is it
[1:48:56] that family is it that family is it that
[1:48:57] brother that sister no no no God
[1:48:59] sometimes just preaches the word for us
[1:49:02] to be prepared and recognize the enemy
[1:49:05] and know that we've been given a defense
[1:49:07] and amen I tell you we stand here today
[1:49:10] no we're not going to build a house over
[1:49:12] the well we're not going to build a
[1:49:13] fortified stable we're not going to put
[1:49:15] dirt on the roof we're going to get in
[1:49:17] the word and the prophet of God said if
[1:49:19] we are under the blood of Jesus Christ
[1:49:21] Satan can't get to us
[1:49:24] oh Lord help us that's our defense my
[1:49:27] brother and sister the word hallelujah
[1:49:29] hallelujah I hope I made at least a
[1:49:32] couple moments of sense this morning
[1:49:34] amen but I tell you my brother and
[1:49:36] sister amen the very word that they say
[1:49:39] confines us
[1:49:41] the bride of Christ Liberty
[1:49:43] thank you Lord all I can say thank you
[1:49:46] Lord amen let's sing that song 478.
[1:49:50] Let's just stand sing a song or two
[1:49:51] before we're dismissed
[1:49:53] amen
[1:49:57] I hope it made sense you know it's hard
[1:49:59] sometimes when you've got all these
[1:50:00] things that are connected together and
[1:50:01] you realize that we're going to be here
[1:50:02] at four o'clock if I preach them all
[1:50:04] and you start just cutting things out
[1:50:06] you start now we'll leave that to the
[1:50:08] side always leaves a little hole in
[1:50:10] there you know what I mean and
[1:50:11] inspiration is as ministers we want to
[1:50:14] fill the hole we don't want to just
[1:50:15] leave any Gap anywhere and yet you look
[1:50:18] at the clock and the clock is just going
[1:50:19] away
[1:50:20] Hallelujah
[1:50:24] for a long time I try
[1:50:38] my heart was so heavy it's in I sang
[1:50:44] glory
[1:50:47] and then I heard about Jesus
[1:50:53] oh what a wonderful hour

[1:51:06] bring me out his saving powers

[1:54:30] the way
[1:54:31] Hallelujah my brother and sister it's so
[1:54:33] interesting you can take almost any
[1:54:36] other modern religion
[1:54:38] and ask them to go back to the Bible and
[1:54:41] anchor what they believe in the Bible
[1:54:46] well you're following a man
[1:54:48] where'd the Baptist Church start
[1:54:51] or the Methodist Church star or the
[1:54:53] Nazarene Church star where do the
[1:54:55] Mormons start
[1:54:57] you know they started the Catholic
[1:54:59] Church on a man who wasn't even present
[1:55:02] wow
[1:55:04] but we have a very clear word of
[1:55:07] Prophecy
[1:55:08] that said you will have need for the
[1:55:11] word to be revealed to you
[1:55:13] and we can take it back we don't lift
[1:55:15] the man up I'm sorry the man was a man
[1:55:18] but he was a man God chose
[1:55:21] just the same as we are men and women
[1:55:24] that God chose that ought to make our
[1:55:26] heart Rejoice because if you reject
[1:55:28] God's choice there then that leaves the
[1:55:31] door open for us to be rejected and I'm
[1:55:33] sorry I'm not rejected I've been
[1:55:35] accepted in the presence of the king
[1:55:37] Hallelujah this world is not my hope
[1:55:42] I'm at the passing through my treasures

[2:04:32] amen hallelujah
[2:04:36] amen well God bless your Saints
[2:04:40] trust you'll be able to go home today
[2:04:42] and say it was good to be in the house
[2:04:43] of the Lord
[2:04:45] amen and I trust all as a minister we
[2:04:48] can do
[2:04:49] is just be able to speak the things that
[2:04:51] God speaks to us and
[2:04:53] I just trust as we look at this that
[2:04:55] we'll just stop and be able to realize
[2:04:57] this battle I'm in right now this
[2:05:00] struggle I'm in right now if I'll just
[2:05:03] let go
[2:05:05] God will defend me
[2:05:06] I don't I don't have to defend myself
[2:05:09] you see every time sister Sue just gave
[2:05:12] me a book she she blesses me with these
[2:05:14] books of history and as you read this
[2:05:17] book
[2:05:18] it's written so deep and so intense that
[2:05:21] I just have to ponder it really slow
[2:05:23] I've maybe only got 30 pages of it read
[2:05:28] they give all kinds of Glory
[2:05:31] to this leadership
[2:05:33] but the book takes you down
[2:05:36] into the trench
[2:05:38] and in the battles that were won I hope
[2:05:41] I'm not boring you here but in the
[2:05:43] battles that were won
[2:05:45] there was a time German Panzer tank
[2:05:48] driving right up to where they were at
[2:05:50] and the barrel being lowered down and
[2:05:54] it's starting to point right at them and
[2:05:56] some of the guys said were dead
[2:05:59] and another guy says we're the victors
[2:06:02] and climbed out the trench
[2:06:04] and put a thermite deal on the tank and
[2:06:07] blew it up
[2:06:09] we got a choice
[2:06:11] stand on the word and say I've been
[2:06:13] given everything I need
[2:06:15] or we can say we're defeated and run
[2:06:18] now the men
[2:06:19] that ran
[2:06:21] very sad story
[2:06:23] we're mowed down
[2:06:25] by other enemy Soldiers the ones that
[2:06:28] stood right there in the face of the
[2:06:30] battle and said I've been called
[2:06:33] to be a Victor in laodicea I've been
[2:06:36] called to stay right here do I have no
[2:06:39] foes to fight
[2:06:40] do I have foes to run from
[2:06:44] there's our decision
[2:06:46] I have foes to fight
[2:06:49] my brother and sister
[2:06:51] fight
[2:06:53] but fight with what God has given you
[2:06:57] not what we think not what we feel not
[2:07:00] what our emotion says but what God has
[2:07:03] given and we have been given the word
[2:07:06] take the word
[2:07:08] amen take the word don't let someone
[2:07:12] take it from you this word was given to
[2:07:15] you and God confirmed that when he wrote
[2:07:17] your name in the book
[2:07:20] he didn't say oh this one will run he
[2:07:23] said no listen when it was Damned
[2:07:26] I want to be found standing in that day
[2:07:28] God bless you turn to one another say
[2:07:31] those precious words of God bless you
[2:07:33] amen I pray the rest of your day is a
[2:07:35] glorious time
[2:07:37] bless your Saints we love you amen
