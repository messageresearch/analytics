[54:32] they were having a catered picnic
[54:37] you could capture a bunny
[54:40] you could look for Easter eggs
[54:44] [Music]
[54:48] you found Christ
[54:52] [Music]
[54:54] I didn't need a bunny
[54:56] I didn't need an Easter egg but I needed
[55:00] Christ
[55:02] I needed him
[55:04] aren't you glad today
[55:06] Hallelujah halleluia
[55:10] I'd like to speak to you this morning
[55:12] on a supernatural expression
[55:16] amen
[55:18] I say Happy Easter to each one of you
[55:21] and it's good to be in the house of the
[55:23] Lord today
[55:25] amen isn't it good to be a part of the
[55:27] Resurrection not just talk about a
[55:30] resurrection but to be part of the
[55:33] Resurrection amen many will talk of a
[55:36] Rapture but to be part of a rapture
[55:40] young people I'm sorry we didn't have
[55:42] Clarity I
[55:44] stood in the basement and waited for the
[55:46] young adults and realized that maybe you
[55:49] didn't realize that there was young
[55:51] adults today
[55:53] but it's good to be here let's turn in
[55:55] our Bibles to Hebrews the first chapter
[56:00] and just trust today you know I'm just
[56:03] going to get it out of the way instead
[56:04] of throwing it in
[56:06] uh just little things that have happened
[56:09] parts of conversations part of today's
[56:12] song service parts of the prayer over
[56:14] the needs of the day a fellowship we
[56:17] were invited to on Friday things that
[56:21] were spoken my brother and sister every
[56:23] one of these has just been speaking to
[56:25] me and I I have to hold myself back to
[56:28] stop from explaining you don't realize
[56:31] what you're saying but they do realize
[56:34] amen because it's alive it's well it's
[56:36] real but this thought has been with me
[56:39] now for several weeks and just coming up
[56:42] to a point and uh you know the
[56:45] inspiration that the Lord gives you a
[56:49] man it it has uh many elements it's not
[56:52] just one inspiration uh that that hits
[56:56] you but there's many elements that that
[56:58] touch you and then move you a few steps
[57:01] forward and move you a few steps forward
[57:03] and even as we were uh sitting in the
[57:06] services Brother David ministered a
[57:08] couple Sundays ago I had to whip out a
[57:12] paper and and I had to write you might
[57:14] say it was clarification of my own
[57:16] thoughts or God's thoughts I I was like
[57:18] oh that that fits right here amen and so
[57:22] you just have to thank God that he said
[57:24] now it's time to just expand this I'm
[57:27] going to open this up a little bit make
[57:28] it a bigger thought and I'll just uh
[57:31] also place this that our sister April
[57:34] and sharing Fellowship some things that
[57:36] she had observed witnessed experienced
[57:39] in in turkey and uh she connected
[57:43] scripture with her experience there and
[57:47] it was all like a dude sister a April to
[57:49] just say hey that's part of Sunday
[57:52] but it's God's grace amen that the mind
[57:55] of Christ now my brother and sister the
[57:57] mind of Christ is not isolated in Nampa
[58:00] Idaho the mind of Christ is touching a
[58:03] bride all over this world Amen that we
[58:07] could if God would allow us pick up and
[58:10] go right to Europe and go right to
[58:12] Africa go right to Asia or Australia or
[58:15] wherever it would be and the bride is of
[58:17] one mind and I thank God that it's of
[58:20] one mind because it was left to the mind
[58:22] of man we would be scattered all over
[58:25] the horizon amen Hebrews the first
[58:28] chapter verses one through three amen
[58:33] we're going to lay a foundation today of
[58:37] um a supernatural expression now we're
[58:40] drawing some of this from things that
[58:42] the prophet of God said and when we look
[58:44] in the word my brother and sister we we
[58:47] find that there are times that the
[58:50] scripture doesn't say it the way we say
[58:52] it but it is saying exactly the same
[58:55] thing we are saying amen it doesn't
[58:57] connect the words I use it as my own
[59:00] personal term as verbiage we can often
[59:03] times if we're not careful be saying the
[59:05] same thing and disagreeing because it's
[59:08] different verbiage amen somebody views a
[59:11] certain word in a certain way we don't
[59:13] view that word the same way but we look
[59:15] today and realize that my brother and
[59:18] sister Easter the resurrection is a
[59:22] supernatural expression of God himself
[59:25] amen it is not just a day now man chose
[59:29] to put a day to a calendar and declare
[59:31] this is the time we're going to sell
[59:33] great Easter I don't think God cared so
[59:35] much about the date on the calendar as
[59:38] the event taking place in our lives amen
[59:41] and when the event is taking place then
[59:43] God says you know what if you can't
[59:45] celebrate Easter on the day then it is
[59:49] fine as long as the Resurrection Life is
[59:52] manifested In You amen
[59:56] Hallelujah God who at sundry times and
[1:00:00] in diverse manners spake in time past
[1:00:03] unto the fathers by the prophets
[1:00:06] now if God was to carry on another
[1:00:08] generation as it were or another time
[1:00:11] which we see scripturally that's not so
[1:00:15] but certainly my brother and sister
[1:00:18] the word that God has spoken Our
[1:00:20] Generation would be encapsulated
[1:00:24] and
[1:00:26] in the first verse
[1:00:30] there won't be another church age but it
[1:00:33] might be that some of us will go to the
[1:00:34] Grave before the coming of the Lord
[1:00:37] and they'll still be men and women
[1:00:40] young people
[1:00:42] that will be able to look at this and
[1:00:43] say you know what God spoke to our
[1:00:45] fathers
[1:00:47] by the prophets
[1:00:49] amen aren't you glad we can have that
[1:00:51] testimony today
[1:00:53] half in these last days spoken unto us
[1:00:56] by his son whom he hath appointed heir
[1:00:59] of All Things by whom also he hath made
[1:01:02] the worlds
[1:01:04] who being the brightness of his glory
[1:01:06] and the express image of his person and
[1:01:10] upholding All Things by the word of his
[1:01:12] power when he had by himself purged our
[1:01:16] sins and sat down on the right hand of
[1:01:19] the Majesty on high Heavenly Father we
[1:01:23] just ask you Lord come move in our midst
[1:01:26] today
[1:01:27] Lord truly we recognize the Word is
[1:01:30] Alive and Well coming to pass in each
[1:01:33] portion father each day in the lives of
[1:01:37] your children we ask for your guiding
[1:01:39] hand today be with the bride of Christ
[1:01:40] around the world Lord many needs still
[1:01:43] thinking father of our sister Kathy Lord
[1:01:46] in recovery having lost her husband
[1:01:49] brother Gideon father and then into this
[1:01:52] accident father she certainly needs your
[1:01:55] tender arms around her father speak to
[1:01:58] the bride there's many needs Lord
[1:02:01] Every Nation every Kindred every tongue
[1:02:04] father there are needs and we just ask
[1:02:06] you father Reach Out And Touch be the
[1:02:08] balm of Gilead to them today we ask in
[1:02:11] the name of Jesus Christ amen you may be
[1:02:14] seated Saints
[1:02:20] if you would turn as we're going to just
[1:02:24] lay a little foundation with some
[1:02:25] scripture here if you turn to Malachi 4.
[1:02:32] now my brother and sister we tend to
[1:02:35] look at Malachi 4
[1:02:37] in a context of God sending a prophet
[1:02:40] but I would like for you today we will
[1:02:43] read
[1:02:44] uh all of Malachi 4 but I want you to
[1:02:49] make a connection here today in the
[1:02:52] overall sense of what God is declaring
[1:02:55] through the prophet Malachi he said
[1:02:58] behold the day cometh that shall burn as
[1:03:01] an oven in all the proud yea and all
[1:03:04] that do wickedly shall be stubble and
[1:03:07] the day that cometh shall burn them up
[1:03:09] saith the Lord of hosts that it shall
[1:03:11] leave them neither root nor Branch but
[1:03:15] unto you
[1:03:17] amen before even the word is spoken of a
[1:03:20] prophet in a generation God is speaking
[1:03:23] directly to a bride of Christ but unto
[1:03:26] you that fear my name now my brother and
[1:03:28] sister this is not the fear that as it
[1:03:31] would cause a man to physically shake or
[1:03:33] or tremble in that sense but this is the
[1:03:36] fear of the reverence of almighty God
[1:03:39] and that reverence my brother and sister
[1:03:41] is such a controlling factor and people
[1:03:44] say I don't like control well you're
[1:03:46] either in control or you're out of
[1:03:48] control and I'm not out of control I'm
[1:03:50] fully under the control of the word for
[1:03:53] my day amen God speaking to me to bring
[1:03:57] me to the place to bring you to the
[1:03:59] place to fulfill your calling amen God
[1:04:02] doesn't just say well someday it might
[1:04:05] work or this will happen or I'll have to
[1:04:07] do this to him or that to him God's
[1:04:09] doing that work right now through the
[1:04:11] word amen in the word is what's taking
[1:04:14] us into our prayer correct place but I'm
[1:04:17] unto you that fear my name shall the son
[1:04:19] of righteousness arise with healing in
[1:04:22] his wings and you know I want to just
[1:04:24] make a moment and connect with the word
[1:04:26] arise as we have used that in some
[1:04:29] thoughts in these previous Services my
[1:04:31] brother and sister there's a time God
[1:04:33] doesn't want us to talk about the word
[1:04:35] of the hour God doesn't want us to just
[1:04:38] acknowledge the word of God he wants us
[1:04:40] to arise and let the word come living in
[1:04:44] you and I to stand up to receive that my
[1:04:48] brother and sister if you take a common
[1:04:50] graduation as it is uh I think our
[1:04:52] sister Alice is going to be graduating
[1:04:55] here I'm not sure the date but in a
[1:04:57] short while my brother and sister they
[1:05:00] want those young people to be there
[1:05:03] during the ceremony all that's taking
[1:05:05] place then they have them come and arise
[1:05:09] to receive the congratulation the
[1:05:13] acknowledgment and the diploma of the
[1:05:16] accomplished punishment of the labor it
[1:05:19] is not some casual stay where you are do
[1:05:21] what you are we're here just thrown on
[1:05:24] leave them in a pile find your own but
[1:05:26] there's something even in the natural of
[1:05:29] the acknowledgment that you have
[1:05:30] accomplished and God wants you and I as
[1:05:33] Sons and Daughters of God predestination
[1:05:36] we can go into that but predestination
[1:05:38] set the pattern of our life it's set the
[1:05:42] Fulfillment of our life but God wants
[1:05:44] you and I to arise and come and receive
[1:05:47] what he has for us to be able to say
[1:05:50] thank you for the acknowledgment Lord
[1:05:52] that you brought me to this place and I
[1:05:55] could I could uh oh how am I trying to
[1:05:57] say this that I could come and and not
[1:06:00] boastfully not proudly but yet be able
[1:06:03] to say by the grace of God I have passed
[1:06:07] the test amen I have run the course and
[1:06:11] I am receiving my reward and God's
[1:06:13] wanting the bride to rise up and take a
[1:06:16] halt of that not to to come you know
[1:06:18] sometimes Saints we are often and I know
[1:06:20] that that there's a balance to this but
[1:06:23] we come and we say well you know I and
[1:06:26] then we back up and say well I mean it's
[1:06:27] not I but it's Christ in me that's good
[1:06:30] but there is a point in time that we
[1:06:32] need to say I am living the word amen
[1:06:35] because the word said he's in you
[1:06:39] amen so we don't have to clarify every
[1:06:43] single time and day of our life he's in
[1:06:45] me he's in me he's in me only reason I
[1:06:48] can live is because he's in me my
[1:06:49] brother and sister he said I'm in you
[1:06:51] and I believe him
[1:06:53] amen so I can speak and say God has
[1:06:57] allowed me to live this life and be able
[1:07:00] to speak with confidence I'm living this
[1:07:03] life
[1:07:04] amen but the devil he comes now I'm not
[1:07:07] talking about you looking at your
[1:07:08] natural life I'm telling you every one
[1:07:10] of us makes mistakes everyone's struggle
[1:07:13] we'll deal with that in just a minute
[1:07:14] but my brother and sister to realize
[1:07:16] what has happened needs to come alive in
[1:07:21] you and I and when it comes alive in you
[1:07:24] and I we don't have to be asked to arise
[1:07:27] there's something in us that wants to
[1:07:29] stand up and say thank you Lord I've got
[1:07:33] the life in me I've got the authority of
[1:07:36] the word in me there's something is
[1:07:39] stirring Within Me
[1:07:42] oh Hallelujah
[1:07:47] oh
[1:07:51] son of righteousness arrives with
[1:07:53] healing in his wings and ye shall go
[1:07:55] forth and grow up as calves of the stall
[1:07:59] you realize
[1:08:00] not everyone wants to be a calf of the
[1:08:03] stall
[1:08:05] that's why some people my brother and
[1:08:07] sister say I feel of being a Christian
[1:08:09] or being the message I feel very boxed
[1:08:12] in I feel very constrained I I want to
[1:08:16] go I want my freedom
[1:08:18] I want my freedom
[1:08:21] but what they don't realize is just
[1:08:23] outside the walls of the stall of the
[1:08:25] word
[1:08:27] is ravening wolves
[1:08:29] hot Winds of judgment
[1:08:34] everything that they don't want
[1:08:37] but think they do
[1:08:40] isn't that what Satan does
[1:08:42] he makes people believe that's the life
[1:08:45] now I'm going to sound judgmental by my
[1:08:47] brother and sister and I don't mean to
[1:08:49] be but in the last few weeks I've met
[1:08:51] some very nice people
[1:08:53] men and women
[1:08:56] and and they're they very much Express
[1:08:59] that they feel free
[1:09:03] but you look at this
[1:09:05] they're constrained
[1:09:08] sounds judgmental to say they're
[1:09:10] constrained that
[1:09:12] they're constrained by something
[1:09:15] we don't call normal
[1:09:17] and neither does the word
[1:09:22] you say well Paul you're being
[1:09:23] judgmental judge me then for being
[1:09:25] judgmental but what about the word
[1:09:28] what about the word
[1:09:32] people look you in the face and say oh
[1:09:34] praise God I've been delivered
[1:09:38] they still dance they still drink they
[1:09:40] still swear
[1:09:43] they still dress terribly
[1:09:45] you see how there's a constraining there
[1:09:49] but they don't want to be in the stall
[1:09:52] I want to serve God like I want to serve
[1:09:55] God I don't even want to serve God like
[1:09:57] God wants me to serve him I want to
[1:10:00] serve him like I want to serve him
[1:10:03] that's my definition of Liberty when I
[1:10:05] get to do what I want to do
[1:10:09] but the calf of the stall my brother and
[1:10:11] sister this is why I'm making emphasis
[1:10:13] the calf of the stall doesn't eat unless
[1:10:16] he's fed he doesn't drink unless it's
[1:10:19] given he doesn't get to go live out
[1:10:21] there in the brambles and be Tangled in
[1:10:24] the wire of the fences of laodicea he
[1:10:26] doesn't get any of that because he's in
[1:10:28] the stall and it's all provided for him
[1:10:31] and I'm happy to say today that I am
[1:10:35] counting on Jehovah Jireh amen I'm
[1:10:38] counting on his provision in my life I'm
[1:10:41] counting on it I am nothing without him
[1:10:45] and it's in that realm right there I
[1:10:48] realize no wonder the world thinks we're
[1:10:50] so strange because we have become the
[1:10:53] most dependent people on the face of the
[1:10:56] Earth in a world that says we'll be
[1:10:58] counting or dependent on no one we want
[1:11:02] to be our own man well I don't want to
[1:11:05] be my own man I want to be Christ man
[1:11:07] amen I want to be his
[1:11:10] I want his Mark of Honor upon me
[1:11:14] I don't want to be identified of my own
[1:11:17] way my own thought my own deed but him
[1:11:22] amen
[1:11:24] oh Hallelujah
[1:11:27] oh my
[1:11:30] for the sake of time a second verse
[1:11:32] really was my emphasis there you look at
[1:11:34] that my brother and sister now
[1:11:37] we also just to touch upon this
[1:11:43] Malachi 4 5 once again I've said it many
[1:11:47] times I believe that very firmly
[1:11:49] and last there would be anyone anywhere
[1:11:51] either hear or hear this would think
[1:11:53] that I am shortstepping the prophet but
[1:11:56] you know having failed English in in
[1:11:59] school and being passed on because the
[1:12:01] teacher didn't want to see my face
[1:12:02] anymore I don't count a lot of credit to
[1:12:05] my own ability to understand English but
[1:12:08] I do understand what becomes the subject
[1:12:12] of the sentence and we read Malachi 4 5
[1:12:15] as though the prophet is the subject of
[1:12:18] the sentence but if it was a live
[1:12:20] conversation we would realize that God
[1:12:23] was speaking to you and I amen behold I
[1:12:27] send you the conversation was not with
[1:12:29] the prophet it was with you and I but we
[1:12:32] needed a profit my brother and sister
[1:12:34] for a restoration we could have said oh
[1:12:38] I've got the word I've got the word but
[1:12:40] it took the prophet's words it took him
[1:12:43] bringing it down in our day in the
[1:12:46] correct fashion to put it into a place
[1:12:48] that we oh aren't you glad today that
[1:12:51] our hearts have been turned back amen
[1:12:53] we're not sitting here today without
[1:12:55] fulfillment of Malachi 4 5 and it took a
[1:12:59] prophet to do it but I'm here to lift my
[1:13:01] hands this morning and say thank you
[1:13:03] Lord you were speaking to me today you
[1:13:07] were speaking to me Lord you knew what I
[1:13:10] would need
[1:13:12] and there was a resurrection oh catch
[1:13:14] this now there was a resurrection of the
[1:13:17] word we're not going back to undo or
[1:13:19] redo 2 000 plus years ago but there was
[1:13:23] a resurrection took place in you and I
[1:13:26] an individual Resurrection it was a
[1:13:30] coming to life my brother and sister
[1:13:32] coming from Death coming back into life
[1:13:35] and that life was a predestinated life
[1:13:38] and God could have looked down through
[1:13:40] the pages of time took the calendar and
[1:13:43] went down there and centuries went by
[1:13:45] and he marked an x on the calendar and
[1:13:49] said this is their Resurrection because
[1:13:52] I've already claimed them I'm bringing
[1:13:55] them back to life I'm bringing them back
[1:13:58] and oh I'll get carried away I wasn't
[1:14:00] going to preach all of this because it's
[1:14:01] too much but my brother and sister when
[1:14:04] you look in the word how it is and how
[1:14:06] God has laid this all out there's time
[1:14:09] and there's place and there's
[1:14:11] circumstance that we as humans say is
[1:14:14] life but to God none of that existed and
[1:14:18] we were in him from the beginning and we
[1:14:20] were always in him but he said there
[1:14:23] comes a day that the seed of life has to
[1:14:26] Spring to life and I'm going to sign
[1:14:29] Shine the sun on the seed in that day
[1:14:33] and he marks the X on there
[1:14:37] Hallelujah
[1:14:41] I'm so glad God found me he always knew
[1:14:44] where I was at
[1:14:45] amen he wasn't wandering around where
[1:14:48] are you Paul where are you Paul where
[1:14:50] are you Paul but he said here it is the
[1:14:54] day
[1:14:59] and if I could naturally type this
[1:15:01] coming into a season we're starting to
[1:15:03] be planting crops and I'm telling you my
[1:15:07] brother and sister people will say
[1:15:08] they'll call me up hey Paul I drove by
[1:15:10] in that corn field that you've got down
[1:15:12] over Yonder I see all your corn come to
[1:15:14] life it's there no my brother and sister
[1:15:16] it's showing now come on be with me it's
[1:15:20] showing now but when that germ come and
[1:15:24] it's something swelled up inside that
[1:15:26] seed and that little tail stuck out
[1:15:29] which becomes the shoot and that little
[1:15:32] tail come out of there which becomes the
[1:15:34] root my brother and sister that's when
[1:15:37] it come to life
[1:15:40] oh right here my brother and sister we
[1:15:43] are the manifestation of a resurrection
[1:15:47] but the life has come long before
[1:15:51] amen the life was not just today the
[1:15:54] life was not just yesterday the life was
[1:15:57] not just when you come to the message
[1:16:01] the life is in you
[1:16:04] oh Hallelujah
[1:16:06] oh my
[1:16:10] behold I send you Elijah the prophet
[1:16:12] before the Great
[1:16:14] and Dreadful day of the Lord
[1:16:17] now there is so much interpretation of
[1:16:19] what Malachi 4 really means
[1:16:22] they want to attribute that to John and
[1:16:24] others but my brother and sister
[1:16:27] as brother Brandon makes very clear amen
[1:16:32] there's never been
[1:16:34] a fire judgment
[1:16:40] so everything leading up to Malachi
[1:16:44] everything following in the New
[1:16:45] Testament after Malachi
[1:16:48] if it was for that day
[1:16:51] it's long overdue that's right
[1:16:54] for our day
[1:16:56] it's right on time
[1:17:02] aren't you glad God opened your eyes
[1:17:05] yeah otherwise we'd still be out in the
[1:17:08] dark out there telling you believe me
[1:17:10] because I have a DD whatever and a PhD
[1:17:13] and a whatever else my brother and
[1:17:15] sister it just amazes me I was watching
[1:17:16] a little deal the other day and uh
[1:17:19] they're they're interviewing this this
[1:17:21] uh this man he actually is a pastor of a
[1:17:24] church but he has all kinds of other
[1:17:25] things he does and and uh as they
[1:17:27] introduce him they don't even mention
[1:17:29] his name sitting there at a table and
[1:17:31] this is Doctor
[1:17:34] and they go through all this whole list
[1:17:36] amen this is not our sister April this
[1:17:39] is Doctor
[1:17:40] and now I don't know what we do we put
[1:17:42] MD and DD and Double D and triple this
[1:17:45] that D and what
[1:17:47] no sir this was my sister April yeah
[1:17:51] but they put so much emphasis
[1:17:54] on the schooling
[1:17:56] and the prophet I didn't bring quotes on
[1:17:58] this because we know it but there's so
[1:18:00] much repetitive as it were redundant of
[1:18:03] these quotes but the prophet of God says
[1:18:05] those things are not what gives
[1:18:08] Revelation to the word
[1:18:11] doctor of divinity means nothing in fact
[1:18:14] the word said I'm going to hide it from
[1:18:16] those guys
[1:18:17] amen I'm going to reveal it to babes any
[1:18:19] babes here today thank you Lord to
[1:18:22] Humble ourselves to be a babe in Christ
[1:18:25] amen and so it's there as it is that it
[1:18:27] touches and we see how that God is doing
[1:18:30] and I just feel very strongly to touch
[1:18:32] on this you need your heart turned
[1:18:35] come on my brother and sister do we need
[1:18:37] our hearts turned
[1:18:39] amen this is what we need to have our
[1:18:42] hearts turn now I'm going to speak a
[1:18:44] little strongly if you don't mind today
[1:18:46] we still have things that crop up in our
[1:18:48] lives amen you know I've had fields that
[1:18:51] I have grown what I would call almost a
[1:18:53] perfect crop without a weed Anywhere But
[1:18:55] Where does the seed come from of the
[1:18:58] weed that grows in the following year
[1:19:00] there's something in humanity that we
[1:19:03] constantly need a respiration a heart
[1:19:06] turning back we constantly need to be
[1:19:09] bathed in the word of God it's not hey I
[1:19:12] got baptized I repented it's finished my
[1:19:15] brother and sister are continual work
[1:19:18] amen but God says you know what I'm
[1:19:20] gonna do I'm gonna restore your heart
[1:19:22] back and when I restore your heart back
[1:19:25] I'll make your flesh follow your heart
[1:19:28] and when he turns our heart to the word
[1:19:31] then we are constantly going and saying
[1:19:34] that's the old man that's not who I am
[1:19:37] that's not me Satan Satan you're a liar
[1:19:40] this is me here in the word that's who I
[1:19:44] am I might not look like it right now I
[1:19:47] might not have acted like it yesterday
[1:19:49] but I know by Revelation who I am and my
[1:19:53] heart has been given to you Lord
[1:19:57] oh the devil's there look I got a I
[1:19:59] gotta lean against you yeah well I'm
[1:20:02] sorry your lien has been paid off amen
[1:20:05] and you cannot recover a lien that has
[1:20:09] been satisfied
[1:20:11] oh Hallelujah that's why the
[1:20:13] resurrection's so beautiful my brother
[1:20:15] and sister he looked down did a title
[1:20:17] search before I even existed on the
[1:20:21] earth he did a title search and said
[1:20:23] this will come against him and this will
[1:20:26] come against him and this will come
[1:20:28] against him but I'm gonna write to check
[1:20:30] today and I'm gonna pay that in advance
[1:20:35] Hallelujah but that doesn't cause the
[1:20:37] devil to say we have a lien we have a
[1:20:38] lien we have a lien
[1:20:40] that's why you don't borrow money
[1:20:43] from same day Title Loan Sharks that's
[1:20:47] right
[1:20:49] because if you can't prove You Paid It
[1:20:51] Off
[1:20:52] they still pursue the debt
[1:20:57] oh very common practice maybe not in
[1:20:59] Idaho we're a little conservative here
[1:21:01] there are some states
[1:21:04] that the loan shark companies turn
[1:21:05] around and file papers against people
[1:21:10] that maybe wadded up their receipt
[1:21:13] of their payment and threw it in the
[1:21:15] trash right in front of them
[1:21:18] they go in put a little check by their
[1:21:19] name
[1:21:22] and serve papers on them in court and
[1:21:24] say you still owe us and they say no I
[1:21:26] paid you
[1:21:27] where's your proof
[1:21:33] we won't go into that it's very
[1:21:35] interesting you ever choose to just
[1:21:37] research something for I don't know
[1:21:39] it's probably a waste of time
[1:21:42] but it has a very strong spiritual
[1:21:45] application
[1:21:47] some states allow even in the time of
[1:21:51] dispute
[1:21:53] up to 67 percent interest
[1:21:57] I'm going to take you another angle
[1:21:59] right here when people don't have enough
[1:22:02] revelation of who they are in Jesus
[1:22:04] Christ and Satan comes and says this
[1:22:07] debt is against you and if you don't
[1:22:10] have a revelation to be able to say I
[1:22:12] have the proof that debt is paid I have
[1:22:16] Christ in me amen this debt is paid and
[1:22:20] if you can't pay that even in the time
[1:22:22] of your arguing and imagine I just want
[1:22:24] to put in this context that Satan would
[1:22:26] then buy his uh own methods his
[1:22:31] slippery Behavior would be able and
[1:22:35] consume 67 percent of your time
[1:22:40] 67 percent of your life
[1:22:43] condemnation fear anxieties depressions
[1:22:48] and everything that goes with that
[1:22:50] consuming your life because you don't
[1:22:52] have a revelation to be able to stand up
[1:22:54] and say the debt is paid
[1:22:57] and I am free and the word says He Who
[1:23:01] is free is free indeed and Satan get out
[1:23:06] of here I'm free the debt is paid
[1:23:10] oh Hallelujah
[1:23:12] all people say well of course we believe
[1:23:14] in Calvary you realize Calvary my
[1:23:16] brother and sister was an Earthly
[1:23:17] expression of something else that took
[1:23:20] place
[1:23:21] oh now look at this
[1:23:23] amen
[1:23:25] this is Supernatural it really is and
[1:23:27] it's a key element to the coming of the
[1:23:29] Lord it has to take place before the
[1:23:31] coming of the Lord amen now look what it
[1:23:34] says it's going to turn the hearts
[1:23:36] doesn't say it's turning any churches or
[1:23:38] religions
[1:23:40] so if we're just in church or we just
[1:23:42] have a religion
[1:23:44] do you realize you can be a one-man
[1:23:46] denomination
[1:23:48] my oh my God
[1:23:51] when you have a conversation with
[1:23:52] someone and they make a statement and
[1:23:54] you say well where did the prophet say
[1:23:55] that
[1:23:57] well he doesn't but
[1:23:59] that's how I believe it
[1:24:02] I tell you what you do in a case like
[1:24:04] that
[1:24:05] flee yeah
[1:24:08] run away from that
[1:24:11] because that's nothing more than a one
[1:24:13] member denomination
[1:24:16] now let's go to John 1 1 for a moment
[1:24:18] now I have verses 1 through 14 but I
[1:24:21] want to just come we know this scripture
[1:24:23] and the whole thing is relevant but for
[1:24:25] the sake of time we want to just move
[1:24:28] down very quickly in the beginning was
[1:24:29] the word and the Word was with God and
[1:24:31] the Word was God that's a very strong
[1:24:33] Foundation right it's anchored we don't
[1:24:35] have any room to look one way or the
[1:24:37] other decide something different amen so
[1:24:40] it says the same was the beginning with
[1:24:41] God now as we jump down through here
[1:24:44] this is a little bit sister April where
[1:24:46] we were thinking of as you were speaking
[1:24:48] the other day sharing your your
[1:24:50] experience Amen in him was life and the
[1:24:54] life was the light of men
[1:24:56] you see we can produce no light for
[1:25:00] anyone unless that life is in US amen
[1:25:04] and so this is why now this is a little
[1:25:06] strong but this is why the denomination
[1:25:09] produces denomination because he's not
[1:25:12] in there to produce the life that is the
[1:25:15] light but they are just replicating the
[1:25:19] plan just like when you receive a
[1:25:21] postcard we could have according to this
[1:25:23] postcard guaranteed triple the people
[1:25:26] here this Easter morning
[1:25:34] they're not worried about life
[1:25:37] they're not worried about light
[1:25:39] they're counting numbers
[1:25:42] my brother and sister I would rather be
[1:25:44] fulfilling the scripture where two or
[1:25:47] three are gathered in his name I would
[1:25:52] rather fulfill that scripture than pack
[1:25:54] this building out
[1:25:56] amen because otherwise all we are is
[1:25:59] just churches or religion and he never
[1:26:02] said one single thing my brother and
[1:26:05] sister about turning the church's heart
[1:26:07] back or the religions back or whatever
[1:26:10] it is he was talking a very personal can
[1:26:14] we say Amen very personal conversation
[1:26:26] there's a preacher on the internet made
[1:26:28] these statements here recently
[1:26:31] come
[1:26:33] to our church
[1:26:35] we're not here to judge anyone
[1:26:39] and neither
[1:26:40] is God that's right
[1:26:45] he obviously has a different Bible than
[1:26:47] we have
[1:26:49] right he obviously serves a different
[1:26:50] God
[1:26:52] my Bible shows that my God is a jealous
[1:26:54] God
[1:26:55] he doesn't want me out here with a
[1:26:57] laodicea and girlfriend
[1:27:00] her boyfriends speak in the church the
[1:27:02] bride as a in feminine doesn't want us
[1:27:05] to have a laodicea and boyfriend
[1:27:07] and think we can come and receive
[1:27:10] benefits
[1:27:11] from our Lord
[1:27:13] he's a jealous God
[1:27:15] but you see the very nature of what it
[1:27:18] is there's Hearts being turned back my
[1:27:20] brother and sister they're being turned
[1:27:22] back to that original nice sea and seed
[1:27:25] that was planted they're turning back to
[1:27:27] that whole thing amen no longer is there
[1:27:30] really what you would call a Protestant
[1:27:33] Reform Revival
[1:27:39] kind of like brother Paul I can now lift
[1:27:41] my hand I don't feel so out of place I
[1:27:42] can lift my hand I drink coffee now
[1:27:47] yeah
[1:27:48] y'all should be really happy Brother
[1:27:50] Paul's grown up
[1:27:52] but if you watched brother Paul making
[1:27:54] coffee you would say I was a backslider
[1:27:59] and we can make all the Motions of
[1:28:01] serving God
[1:28:02] but it is so diluted down with this and
[1:28:06] a little of that and just a couple drops
[1:28:08] of sweetener amen and a little bit of
[1:28:11] chocolate it's not coffee in my book
[1:28:13] amen we're talking about denominations
[1:28:15] it's not coffee unless it has chocolate
[1:28:18] in it
[1:28:20] according to me
[1:28:22] now use that silly analogy to show that
[1:28:25] when we come to the place that we've got
[1:28:27] to add a little bit of man into the
[1:28:30] message to make it palatable then count
[1:28:33] me out I want the word as a prophet
[1:28:36] brought it because I have a written
[1:28:38] promise that will turn my heart back and
[1:28:42] I want my heart turned back amen I want
[1:28:44] my heart before the Lord amen hallelujah
[1:28:47] now as we look at this we'll look at
[1:28:49] that in in John 1 also moving forward
[1:28:53] here
[1:28:54] not moving very fast but we are moving
[1:28:56] amen now in John 1 we just see how this
[1:29:01] describes what the word is and who the
[1:29:03] word is and how it's coming to us and I
[1:29:05] want to focus right here uh the witness
[1:29:08] as it is in these verses 6 7 8 right in
[1:29:11] that realm and a man sent from God whose
[1:29:13] name was John amen so God chose the man
[1:29:16] the name well we know our names mean
[1:29:19] something amen the same came for a
[1:29:22] witness to Bear witness of the light
[1:29:24] that all men through him might believe
[1:29:28] he was not that light
[1:29:30] wait it sure sounds like that it was
[1:29:33] there that because of him and him being
[1:29:36] a witness that it would cause men to
[1:29:38] believe and then the word turns around
[1:29:40] and clarifies and says you know what
[1:29:42] he's not the light
[1:29:46] apply that coming forward
[1:29:49] amen there was a man named William
[1:29:53] that came in our generation my brother
[1:29:55] and sister and he come to be a witness a
[1:29:57] record of the light but in the end we
[1:30:00] have to just put it back in the context
[1:30:02] amen that it was not he was not the
[1:30:06] light but he was the witness of the
[1:30:08] light are you with me
[1:30:11] amen so but he was sent to Bear witness
[1:30:14] of that light that was a True Light
[1:30:16] which lightened every man that cometh in
[1:30:18] the world but he was in the world and
[1:30:20] the world was made by him speaking of
[1:30:22] our Lord Jesus and the world knew him
[1:30:25] not and he came into his own in his own
[1:30:27] received him not but in verse 12 as many
[1:30:31] the go to verse 12 brother Gideon but as
[1:30:34] many as received him he gave them and
[1:30:38] let's just break this up and I forget
[1:30:40] what they call that restructure you know
[1:30:42] when they did the whole things and we
[1:30:44] did the lines and whatever else amen as
[1:30:47] many as received him so let's put
[1:30:49] receive first there has to be for any
[1:30:52] action for the rest of this to mean
[1:30:54] anything there had to be the action of
[1:30:58] receiving
[1:31:01] but we know we can't receive Christ
[1:31:03] without him calling us first
[1:31:05] look how this ties together so knitted
[1:31:08] together
[1:31:12] oh
[1:31:14] but as many as received him
[1:31:16] so those receiving were given power
[1:31:20] to just become anything no sir sons of
[1:31:24] God and of course we know that's
[1:31:26] masculine and feminine even to them that
[1:31:29] believe on his name which were born not
[1:31:33] of blood nor of the will of the flesh
[1:31:34] nor the will of man but of God I'll tell
[1:31:37] you my brother and sister I'm glad of my
[1:31:39] parents that God gave me on this Earth
[1:31:41] but I'm here to tell you I have a
[1:31:43] greater identity with my Lord Jesus
[1:31:46] Christ amen I'm of his Heritage I know
[1:31:49] brother Chris had been speaking to the
[1:31:50] young adults about DNA I was going to
[1:31:53] speak on DNA from a little angle this
[1:31:55] morning but you look at this my brother
[1:31:57] and sister I know how to trace my DNA
[1:31:59] back I'm not tracing it back to some
[1:32:02] Catholic Church where my daddy come from
[1:32:04] I'm not tracing it back to some Mormon
[1:32:06] church where my mama come from I'm not
[1:32:08] tracing it back to Nazarene and
[1:32:10] methodists that they come through the
[1:32:12] route I'm not tracing it back to the
[1:32:14] church that was in Greenleaf years ago
[1:32:16] and the one in Middle 10 years ago and
[1:32:18] the one in Star years ago and the
[1:32:20] several that have been strung around
[1:32:22] Nampa through the years I don't trace my
[1:32:24] DNA back there my DNA goes all the way
[1:32:28] back Amen in fact one of the first
[1:32:32] expressions of my DNA was on Calvary
[1:32:35] that was an expression oh yeah the word
[1:32:38] says that we were in him in Calvary and
[1:32:41] to be in him we had to be his seed
[1:32:46] I hope I'm making sense
[1:32:48] amen I'm I'm really packing a lot of
[1:32:51] stuff in here because there's just too
[1:32:53] much amen
[1:32:55] now let's look at this
[1:32:57] drawing this out of what the prophet of
[1:32:58] God said
[1:33:00] the word
[1:33:01] is a supernatural expression of God
[1:33:04] himself
[1:33:06] in other words Saints if we can't find
[1:33:08] God here
[1:33:10] you're going to have a hard time finding
[1:33:11] him
[1:33:14] just like the prophet of God said you
[1:33:16] should be able to pick up your Bible
[1:33:18] and find yourself that's right
[1:33:22] that's right yeah
[1:33:25] yeah did a little of that DNA stuff it's
[1:33:27] almost scary
[1:33:29] amen always thought I was a German I
[1:33:32] blamed a lot of my attitude Through The
[1:33:34] Years on a German
[1:33:35] but I don't know those people from
[1:33:37] Norway Scandinavians they must have
[1:33:39] attitudes also
[1:33:43] are you all Scandinavians
[1:33:46] are you all Germans no you're humans
[1:33:52] were we tracing our DNA back
[1:33:56] you know that's one of the great
[1:33:57] arguments there is in the world today
[1:34:01] I won't go there
[1:34:04] I won't go there
[1:34:07] so the words the supernatural expression
[1:34:09] of God himself amen and that expression
[1:34:11] is actually revealed in you and I
[1:34:14] not expression when we get down to this
[1:34:16] we say well I don't feel like I could
[1:34:18] really be the expression of God well my
[1:34:20] brother and sister I can't find a single
[1:34:22] scripture that defines the value of your
[1:34:24] feelings amen but we are the expression
[1:34:27] manifested now let's go right here and
[1:34:30] who is this Melchizedek amen now notice
[1:34:33] his attribute then that attribute was
[1:34:35] first God the thought the attribute
[1:34:38] itself all in one without being
[1:34:41] expressed and then when he expressed
[1:34:43] secondarily he became then the word and
[1:34:46] then the word was made flesh and dwelt
[1:34:48] Among Us Saint John the first chapter
[1:34:50] first verse notice in the beginning but
[1:34:53] before the Eternal notice in the
[1:34:56] beginning was the word and when time
[1:34:58] began it was word but before it was word
[1:35:02] it was an attribute of thought and then
[1:35:05] it was expressed in the beginning was
[1:35:09] the expression the word
[1:35:11] amen now if the word is in you and I can
[1:35:15] someone say Amen this morning the word
[1:35:17] is in you and I then if the word is in
[1:35:19] you and I then we are this Revelation
[1:35:22] expressed amen and the word is
[1:35:25] Supernatural so I can say today I have
[1:35:29] you have the supernatural expressed in
[1:35:33] you now if we have Supernatural DNA in
[1:35:36] us a supernatural expression of almighty
[1:35:39] God in us then I lift a hand today and
[1:35:43] say Lord help us to express not the
[1:35:47] carnal laodicea not the religious
[1:35:50] laodicea not the church order as it were
[1:35:54] of Denham denominational uh Express but
[1:35:58] to express the supernatural expression
[1:36:01] of the word in this hour oh brother Paul
[1:36:04] that sounds sophisticated no it isn't
[1:36:06] you're living it
[1:36:08] you're living it God come down and said
[1:36:11] I'm going to let you be an expression of
[1:36:12] the Supernatural and we're living oh
[1:36:15] I'll tell you what my brother and sister
[1:36:16] if we just saw the demons that hate you
[1:36:20] they hate you with a passion and want to
[1:36:23] destroy you and if you saw them with
[1:36:26] your natural eye you would tremble in
[1:36:29] your flesh but God has given you an
[1:36:32] ability by the word to be able to look
[1:36:35] and say I recognize what the spirits are
[1:36:38] I recognize there's influence I feel the
[1:36:41] pressure
[1:36:43] anybody ever feel the pressure I feel
[1:36:46] the pressure the demon that you feel the
[1:36:49] pressure from would terrify you if you
[1:36:52] saw what it looked like
[1:36:55] and if you saw its heart
[1:36:57] and soul
[1:37:01] but we're in the stall
[1:37:03] amen
[1:37:04] how can someone say praise it amen we're
[1:37:07] in the stall that demon can't get into
[1:37:11] the stall because that was reserved for
[1:37:15] the righteous amen that was reserved for
[1:37:18] the holy and it's not that the demon can
[1:37:20] just get in because it's Christ himself
[1:37:23] who's bringing the word to you it's
[1:37:26] Christ himself who is watering and
[1:37:28] feeding you it is not the spirit of
[1:37:31] laodicea it's not the Demons of this
[1:37:34] Darkness but it's God himself bringing
[1:37:37] that amen oh aren't you glad what is the
[1:37:41] stall it's the word amen there that
[1:37:45] draws the four walls of the Tabernacle
[1:37:47] around you and I the four walls of God's
[1:37:50] dwelling place as surrounding us and
[1:37:54] Satan can't get in there and if you will
[1:37:56] just watch and we'll see more of this
[1:37:58] for the word says that as the latter
[1:38:00] times would come that God would start to
[1:38:03] call out all of these spirits that are
[1:38:06] there trying to deceive the bride he'll
[1:38:08] call them out in the church they'll be
[1:38:10] here Saints don't you think they won't
[1:38:12] be here but God will start calling them
[1:38:15] out and he's not calling him out to
[1:38:17] shame them he's calling it out that you
[1:38:19] and I will recognize what is influencing
[1:38:23] our life amen all let's go to do this
[1:38:27] let's go to do that I want you to stop
[1:38:30] don't judge the individual but why does
[1:38:32] that Spirit want you to go to some of
[1:38:34] these places why does that Spirit want
[1:38:37] you to accept that music why does that
[1:38:39] Spirit want you to accept a certain
[1:38:41] style of clothing
[1:38:46] judge it
[1:38:48] judge it my brother and sister
[1:38:51] we stay in the stall under the word amen
[1:38:54] we don't realize how blessed we are to
[1:38:56] be protected by the word of God in this
[1:38:58] hour
[1:38:59] oh Hallelujah
[1:39:01] amen where am I
[1:39:04] Hallelujah
[1:39:07] but before it was word it was an
[1:39:09] attribute of thought then it was
[1:39:11] expressed and in the beginning was the
[1:39:12] expression
[1:39:14] see that expression now my brother and
[1:39:16] sister I've said this many times and I
[1:39:18] guess I'll just say it again amen I
[1:39:21] believe
[1:39:22] and I put that in that fashion so that
[1:39:24] way you can just toss it out if you
[1:39:26] don't like it
[1:39:27] but I believe that it was not
[1:39:30] spirits
[1:39:31] that were discerned
[1:39:33] and cast out
[1:39:35] I don't believe that it was the healing
[1:39:38] lines
[1:39:40] I don't believe it was a lot of the
[1:39:42] stuff that people look at and say that's
[1:39:44] the Vindication of brother branham's
[1:39:45] Ministry
[1:39:48] I tell you what I believe it is and I
[1:39:50] take this out of the word
[1:39:53] my heart
[1:39:55] your heart
[1:39:58] the bride of Christ in 2023.
[1:40:02] has been and is continuing to be turned
[1:40:07] back to him
[1:40:09] there's the Vindication my brother and
[1:40:12] sister there's men out here that live
[1:40:14] all kinds of horrible lives and discern
[1:40:16] people
[1:40:19] there's people out here that lay hands
[1:40:21] on people and they're healed
[1:40:24] and evidence clearly shows that they're
[1:40:27] not even living the word
[1:40:29] so we can't go to all these things
[1:40:31] people say well our young people are
[1:40:33] speaking in tongues I have no criticism
[1:40:36] of that but that doesn't prove a single
[1:40:39] thing
[1:40:40] because there's people out there just as
[1:40:42] brother Branham was at Mishawaka there's
[1:40:45] people out there that all kinds of
[1:40:46] Supernatural and spirituals things that
[1:40:49] they speak and they're living corrupt
[1:40:51] lives so those things don't matter but
[1:40:53] when the heart Can someone say Amen when
[1:40:57] the heart is turned back to Christ amen
[1:41:01] the heart is what is moving out day by
[1:41:04] day by day by day into his presence
[1:41:08] there's vindication
[1:41:10] there's proof that Something's Happened
[1:41:12] in laodicea
[1:41:14] amen hallelujah thank you Lord
[1:41:17] oh
[1:41:19] is it okay to be excited about the word
[1:41:22] I'm going to tell you this message is
[1:41:24] not about the flesh
[1:41:26] come on
[1:41:28] if it was about to flash then we would
[1:41:30] all now pardon me sisters I'm only
[1:41:32] making a point but you sisters would all
[1:41:35] wear a dress that drug in the dirt
[1:41:42] and we would have a book this thick
[1:41:43] telling you how to live
[1:41:46] that's when it comes to the flesh
[1:41:49] but I tell you what we have we do have a
[1:41:51] book that thick
[1:41:53] but it wasn't published by us
[1:41:56] it was given to us amen as a gift
[1:42:00] from almighty God
[1:42:02] and in that book we read it now I'm just
[1:42:05] going to use myself and brother Trevor
[1:42:06] for an example we read the book and my
[1:42:09] brother and sister
[1:42:11] brother Trevor and I we don't interpret
[1:42:13] the book exactly the same
[1:42:19] that should be a problem shouldn't it
[1:42:24] but what's in the book
[1:42:26] is bringing the same results
[1:42:29] in brother Trevor as it's bringing in me
[1:42:33] if I make emphasis on the the
[1:42:37] and he makes emphasis on another word
[1:42:40] but we're both
[1:42:42] have given our heart
[1:42:45] God says
[1:42:47] yes
[1:42:48] I'll give you an example
[1:42:52] I don't know if maybe maybe this would
[1:42:55] come to pass today I don't know
[1:42:58] my wife makes a pretty mean apple pie
[1:43:01] Sister Sarah makes a pretty mean apple
[1:43:03] pie
[1:43:04] they're completely different
[1:43:10] but they're exactly the same
[1:43:16] that gets you guys attention that just
[1:43:19] made my stomach growl
[1:43:22] you see it was a different taste and
[1:43:25] somebody'd say I like the taste of
[1:43:27] sister Sarah's it's different than
[1:43:29] Jerry's does
[1:43:31] and some say I like sister Jerry's
[1:43:35] if somebody says anybody want a piece of
[1:43:37] apple pie
[1:43:39] I'm not going to turn down sister
[1:43:40] Sarah's pie
[1:43:42] hey you better believe I'm not
[1:43:44] well actually I I would have to say this
[1:43:47] stage of my life I would
[1:43:50] now I don't want to terrify anybody here
[1:43:51] but I want to ask you to keep praying
[1:43:53] for brother Paul
[1:43:55] sister April will get terrified and some
[1:43:57] of you will get terrified but in the
[1:44:00] last few months here I have dropped my
[1:44:02] blood sugar
[1:44:03] over a hundred points
[1:44:07] and it's still high
[1:44:11] But I'm Healed
[1:44:16] and I've caught a revelation
[1:44:19] I complain Lord have mercy on me I
[1:44:22] complain I tell everybody the wife's got
[1:44:24] me on Sawdust and cardboard
[1:44:27] and the cardboard has too much carbs so
[1:44:29] she's starting to limit that
[1:44:33] you see what God's doing my brother and
[1:44:35] sister
[1:44:36] he's bringing us all
[1:44:38] not by our understanding but by our
[1:44:42] hearts
[1:44:43] and he's the one who created the heart
[1:44:45] he's the one that Anointed The Heart
[1:44:47] he's the one that's drawing the heart
[1:44:48] and he's pulling this bride into one
[1:44:51] atmosphere and that atmosphere is not an
[1:44:54] atmosphere of creating the best place
[1:44:56] possible on the Earth today but that
[1:44:58] atmosphere is a spirit that says Lord my
[1:45:01] heart longs to get out of here my heart
[1:45:04] longs to be in your presence Lord my
[1:45:07] heart longs it becomes our language my
[1:45:10] brother and sister not just because I
[1:45:12] don't like the politics I don't like the
[1:45:14] economy my heart
[1:45:17] thank you
[1:45:20] oh
[1:45:22] you see
[1:45:24] this message not about the flesh but our
[1:45:27] flesh will know and let me say it this
[1:45:30] way our flesh does know the message of
[1:45:33] the hour
[1:45:34] amen we didn't just take it internal and
[1:45:36] say well praise God I believe it down
[1:45:39] inside and the flesh it's just the flesh
[1:45:41] it don't matter you know my brother and
[1:45:42] sister that was a foundation of the two
[1:45:44] Soul Doctrine I was where people were
[1:45:46] like well they can't they didn't have
[1:45:48] enough heart they didn't have enough
[1:45:50] courage to subject themselves to the
[1:45:53] word and actually change so they just
[1:45:55] said well you got to understand now that
[1:45:58] the inside of me my heart my soul
[1:46:00] believes all of the word and my flesh
[1:46:03] that's a whole different story I'm
[1:46:05] telling you my brother and sister this
[1:46:07] flesh will know the message
[1:46:10] this flash will know Christ
[1:46:14] amen
[1:46:16] otherwise I'm telling you the two Soul
[1:46:18] doctrines pretty one pretty easy to live
[1:46:25] until some Midnight Hour that's right if
[1:46:29] you should find
[1:46:31] you're in prison
[1:46:34] it won't get you out that's right amen
[1:46:38] but if we're not careful
[1:46:40] we'll actually join so Doctrine without
[1:46:42] realizing we're joining it
[1:46:44] because we'll make excuses for our flesh
[1:46:48] when the word said that it would restore
[1:46:51] our heart back
[1:46:56] amen our flesh shall know the spirit
[1:46:58] won't it
[1:47:01] come on our flesh is going to know the
[1:47:02] spirit of God Amen
[1:47:04] amen if we don't know the spirit of God
[1:47:06] something's missing from our experience
[1:47:10] and it will know truth
[1:47:13] Hallelujah
[1:47:14] and our soul will know Christ the word
[1:47:16] amen amen otherwise we have not any
[1:47:19] Redemption
[1:47:21] we can talk about the resurrection but
[1:47:23] if we don't know Christ
[1:47:26] then Resurrection is nothing but
[1:47:29] vocabulary
[1:47:31] and anyone you know I've read enough
[1:47:33] science stuff I don't like being around
[1:47:35] brother Trevor though because I think I
[1:47:37] know something about aerodynamics or
[1:47:39] something and brother Trevor's like well
[1:47:40] no brother Paul it's like this and the x
[1:47:42] times the Y and the D and blah blah blah
[1:47:44] blah and I'm like
[1:47:45] okay I'll tell you what that is I got a
[1:47:47] revelation brother Trevor
[1:47:49] when there's enough power pushing the
[1:47:51] plane down the runway it flies
[1:47:53] I understand aerodynamics
[1:47:57] but you see my brother and sister
[1:47:58] brother Trevor and I
[1:48:01] we've jumped on airplanes and we've
[1:48:03] flown
[1:48:04] and my seat arrived there also even
[1:48:07] though I couldn't explain how something
[1:48:09] that weighs a few hundred thousand
[1:48:11] pounds can go through the atmosphere
[1:48:16] look how beautiful God is
[1:48:19] my I can see the floor opening up
[1:48:21] brother Trevor and ball going out and
[1:48:23] Landon who knows where and what happened
[1:48:26] to him he couldn't explain it
[1:48:28] he didn't explain it
[1:48:30] but when I get in the heart of that
[1:48:32] plane and I get in the heart of Christ
[1:48:35] and Christ gets in my heart
[1:48:38] Hallelujah I've got a one-way ticket out
[1:48:41] of here I don't have to worry about
[1:48:42] being left behind and I don't have to
[1:48:45] explain it
[1:48:47] oh Hallelujah when I'm on the airplane
[1:48:50] and the flaps go out and it says we're
[1:48:53] Landing in Orlando in 10 minutes amen I
[1:48:57] don't have to say how did this do it
[1:49:00] and when I'm standing and you're
[1:49:02] standing Before the Throne of almighty
[1:49:04] God we're not going to have to say ah
[1:49:06] what it is people say well are we going
[1:49:08] to this and that I don't think your mind
[1:49:10] is going to be thinking carnal when you
[1:49:12] get there it's not going to be about all
[1:49:15] the battles I face we're going to be
[1:49:17] looking on his glory and we're going to
[1:49:19] be saying Thank You Lord thank you Lord
[1:49:22] it was worth it all how beautiful
[1:49:26] amen so what happens amen our soul knows
[1:49:30] Christ the word and how this is coming
[1:49:32] to us my brother and sister it's coming
[1:49:34] in spirit and in truth
[1:49:36] you can have I've heard people say well
[1:49:39] you know now if we have the right spirit
[1:49:42] will lead us to the right doctor and I
[1:49:44] tell you what I know some really nice
[1:49:45] people and they've been I'm not judging
[1:49:48] them but they've been in their Doctrine
[1:49:50] for 40 years and entrenched where they
[1:49:53] become angry
[1:49:55] if you speak to them in any other
[1:49:57] fashion
[1:50:00] and their defense when you say but this
[1:50:02] is what the Bible says and this is what
[1:50:05] the prophet said
[1:50:07] you've got to have a revelation
[1:50:10] I do
[1:50:13] yeah
[1:50:14] it's right here in the word
[1:50:17] and it's right here in the message and
[1:50:20] I've got a revelation God meant it
[1:50:23] that's about all the revelations
[1:50:24] sometimes we have to have
[1:50:26] I'm telling you you talk to people that
[1:50:29] knew those people in Kentucky and down
[1:50:31] through that country and I've had the
[1:50:33] privilege of visiting with some of them
[1:50:35] in the areas of Kentucky and I'm telling
[1:50:38] you they're talking about how that those
[1:50:40] people and brother Branham references to
[1:50:42] them amen they're talking about how they
[1:50:45] had first and second grade educations
[1:50:49] and they could not hardly and explain
[1:50:51] anything to you but when they met Christ
[1:50:55] that word was so real to them because it
[1:50:58] wasn't coming from here it was coming
[1:51:01] from here and the word in the heart will
[1:51:04] produce amen oh Hallelujah let me get on
[1:51:08] track here
[1:51:09] see what it is my brother and sister
[1:51:11] would come to a time that Christ has
[1:51:13] unveiled himself do we believe that amen
[1:51:16] the seventh seal people want to make the
[1:51:18] seven seal is a great mystery because
[1:51:20] they can't believe it could be so simple
[1:51:22] as Christ unveiled to you and I but when
[1:51:26] Christ unveiled himself and opened up
[1:51:28] that seventh seal which was he himself
[1:51:30] he opened that up he said you know I'm
[1:51:33] going to unveil myself to a Brine and
[1:51:35] we'll look at this even in the Realms of
[1:51:37] the message there's people say well we
[1:51:39] have this quote we have that quote I'm
[1:51:41] going to tell you I don't need quotes
[1:51:43] I've got experience I met him myself he
[1:51:47] spoke to me he changed my heart I don't
[1:51:50] need to read a bunch of quotes to try to
[1:51:52] prove that Christ unveiled himself in
[1:51:55] this hour to a bride
[1:51:58] this is not an arranged marriage my
[1:52:00] brother and sister
[1:52:01] well it is
[1:52:04] but not arranged as in you don't know
[1:52:06] your bridegroom before you marry him
[1:52:09] I read a very haunting story here
[1:52:11] sometime back of a young girl way too
[1:52:13] young to be married
[1:52:14] way too young
[1:52:16] never met the man the man shelled out
[1:52:19] the equivalent
[1:52:21] of a hundred thousand dollars for her
[1:52:27] and what went with that
[1:52:30] everything about the story
[1:52:33] cause your heart to break
[1:52:46] truly this is an arranged marriage
[1:52:55] but how
[1:52:56] how glorious amen
[1:52:59] I'll get to know my bridegroom amen
[1:53:01] right now
[1:53:03] I'll get to know his kindness his love
[1:53:05] for me
[1:53:07] I get to know everything is hearts
[1:53:09] desire for me
[1:53:12] I'd never looked at that my mind is like
[1:53:14] this is not an arranged marriage but
[1:53:16] amen I was in him before the foundation
[1:53:19] of the world
[1:53:20] amen I've been with him all the days of
[1:53:23] my life amen but the beauty of it is is
[1:53:26] I get to know him and he has the
[1:53:29] expression back to me that I know he
[1:53:32] knows me
[1:53:33] oh Hallelujah
[1:53:36] amen an unveiled Christ leads to an
[1:53:40] unveiled relationship amen I'm telling
[1:53:43] you we talk about it we hear it
[1:53:45] sometimes I think we get so redundant
[1:53:47] about it we really forget the depth of
[1:53:49] it my brother and sister to realize at a
[1:53:52] time if you went behind the veil you
[1:53:54] would die they would drag you out even
[1:53:56] the priests as good a life as they lived
[1:53:58] in the presentation that they lived amen
[1:54:01] if they didn't go in there clean they
[1:54:03] drug them out with a rope amen death
[1:54:05] behind the veil but now we recognize by
[1:54:08] the word that it's death if we don't go
[1:54:10] behind the veil because now I just want
[1:54:13] to say this in very careful words but we
[1:54:16] know that in the marriage it takes place
[1:54:18] behind the veil it doesn't take place in
[1:54:22] the church it doesn't take place in the
[1:54:24] reception hall it doesn't take place
[1:54:26] anywhere else it takes place behind the
[1:54:29] veil amen and God is calm and that's why
[1:54:33] the prophet of God intent Vision says
[1:54:35] this won't be a public display any
[1:54:37] longer this is not a casual marriage of
[1:54:40] the terms of the world but this is a
[1:54:43] marriage of a bride and a bridegroom and
[1:54:46] it is a private thing it's a secret
[1:54:48] thing and a unfolding oh my brother and
[1:54:51] sister sister Jerry and I just joking
[1:54:53] about this the other day once again I
[1:54:56] looked at her and I said would you marry
[1:54:58] me again and she said at about five
[1:55:00] years and I would think about it oh my
[1:55:03] brother and sister I'm like really and
[1:55:06] she's like well you have to admit you
[1:55:08] wasn't grown up yet
[1:55:11] listen I'll go there I was talking about
[1:55:12] you marrying me not about my maturity
[1:55:16] but you realize I like how brother
[1:55:19] Donnie Reagan put it one time really
[1:55:21] straightforward he says you know if I
[1:55:23] have a brother call me up and say
[1:55:24] brother Paul I mean brother Donnie
[1:55:26] brother Donnie I I've um I found her
[1:55:29] I found her
[1:55:31] I want we want to come in for some
[1:55:33] marriage counseling
[1:55:34] brother they're always like okay how
[1:55:36] about coming this time and blah blah and
[1:55:38] when they come in here okay here comes
[1:55:39] this brother and he's got a little
[1:55:41] little 12 year old girl by the hand
[1:55:45] and walking in there for some marriage
[1:55:46] counseling
[1:55:48] no man in his right mind
[1:55:51] what's an immature
[1:55:53] Pride
[1:55:55] no man in his right mind wants some
[1:55:59] circumstance like that I just want to
[1:56:01] keep this very above board
[1:56:05] brother Donnie the god behold brother
[1:56:07] Donnie I'm so in love with her brother
[1:56:09] Donnie would be like little girl you
[1:56:11] stay here you go repent pray through
[1:56:15] right because the whole motive and
[1:56:17] Christ doesn't want an immature bride
[1:56:19] either he wants one that can come and
[1:56:21] live the life and provide be the
[1:56:24] expression of who he is amen he's not
[1:56:28] looking for a bride oh I just love the
[1:56:30] Lord He blesses me all the time
[1:56:33] and when the money Runs Out
[1:56:35] mostly they run out too
[1:56:38] Hallelujah
[1:56:39] amen
[1:56:41] I hope this doesn't sound controversial
[1:56:43] to you today
[1:56:47] do you know Jesus didn't have to go to
[1:56:49] Calvary
[1:56:54] find me one word in the Bible
[1:56:58] that declares Jesus had to go to Calvary
[1:57:04] you realize he could have just spoke the
[1:57:05] word
[1:57:09] but he so knew what the world would turn
[1:57:13] to
[1:57:14] he so knew what we would face
[1:57:19] you know some of us not very good with
[1:57:21] electronics
[1:57:22] things like that
[1:57:27] do you know if tomorrow you called me up
[1:57:29] and said brother Paul I bought a piece
[1:57:31] of ground and I want you to build me a
[1:57:32] house
[1:57:34] you know I can build your house
[1:57:37] from the ground up
[1:57:42] yeah
[1:57:43] but because I am not a contractor
[1:57:47] if you ever flipped a light on
[1:57:50] and it flickered and the bulb went out
[1:57:53] you'd be convinced your house was going
[1:57:55] to burn down
[1:57:58] but I can do it
[1:58:01] I can do it
[1:58:06] Jesus said
[1:58:08] I could lay it all out
[1:58:11] all I have to do is speak the word
[1:58:15] it's done
[1:58:17] they're redeemed
[1:58:21] but did you know we as humans designed
[1:58:24] by God
[1:58:26] need examples
[1:58:29] that's why the scripture says that our
[1:58:31] Elder sisters should be Godly examples
[1:58:33] to the younger
[1:58:35] it says that God doesn't want to put a
[1:58:37] novice in charge of the church that he
[1:58:39] could lead it correctly because he's got
[1:58:42] experience to be example
[1:58:44] and we have a lot of examples concerning
[1:58:46] the word that fashion so what did Jesus
[1:58:48] do he said you know what I'm not going
[1:58:50] to just speak the word because then the
[1:58:52] people would be like well okay I guess
[1:58:54] the word is just spoken I don't have to
[1:58:56] invest nothing I don't have to do
[1:58:57] nothing what God Said is I'm gonna I'm
[1:59:00] gonna
[1:59:00] I'm gonna come down here and I'm gonna
[1:59:03] make these people
[1:59:06] come to realization
[1:59:08] what it cost
[1:59:10] to redeem them
[1:59:13] I want them to understand the sacrifice
[1:59:17] that took place I want them to see the
[1:59:20] whole picture
[1:59:23] and he was bruised
[1:59:26] we could take our little pin out today
[1:59:28] and scratch it
[1:59:30] not for the world's iniquity Saints
[1:59:34] for Paul's iniquity
[1:59:40] he wanted us to realize that
[1:59:43] how powerful
[1:59:49] to see the image
[1:59:51] visually because we obviously can't see
[1:59:53] it physically
[1:59:55] see the image as it is
[1:59:57] how great the price was paid
[2:00:00] and then when my flesh doesn't obey my
[2:00:03] heart
[2:00:04] I can realize
[2:00:06] the bruises the cuts the piercings the
[2:00:10] stripes
[2:00:11] were my fault
[2:00:15] but then by compassion by grace mercy
[2:00:19] refreshed every morning
[2:00:21] I can realize
[2:00:24] I did that to him but I didn't
[2:00:28] he actually
[2:00:29] chose
[2:00:32] chose to do that
[2:00:34] for us
[2:00:38] so he goes to Calvary
[2:00:40] he goes to the tomb
[2:00:43] rises from the tomb and we look at this
[2:00:46] in the context that we do and and it
[2:00:48] just being fresh to me when we've just
[2:00:50] been there
[2:00:51] and and you look and and it's you just
[2:00:54] realize you know what
[2:00:56] Golgotha
[2:00:58] it says it was cruel mockings
[2:01:02] do you know that cruel mocking sauce
[2:01:03] place the cross beside the highway
[2:01:06] and let everyone who is coming
[2:01:10] who is coming for the feasts
[2:01:13] coming
[2:01:14] for this
[2:01:16] to look up and say this is the man who
[2:01:19] thought he was our Messiah
[2:01:24] but look what this is
[2:01:27] blind to this day
[2:01:30] eyes opened this day
[2:01:34] how beautiful it is my brother and
[2:01:36] sister that he come to make it real to
[2:01:39] you and I not words on a page not a
[2:01:42] story that was told but real
[2:01:45] amen real to you and I that in an age
[2:01:49] that comes and wants to turn
[2:01:50] Christianity into almost like a folk
[2:01:52] thing oh yeah I just said Jesus died for
[2:01:54] us my brother and sister there is a
[2:01:56] bride out here that says I know what my
[2:02:00] husband paid for me
[2:02:02] I know the price he paid to make me
[2:02:07] oh Hallelujah and let that let that reel
[2:02:09] in our hearts and souls amen because one
[2:02:12] word would have changed everything but
[2:02:15] he said I'm going to show you I want to
[2:02:17] show you what it is that I have done I
[2:02:19] want to show you what the value of the
[2:02:21] blood is amen amen he was Resurrection
[2:02:24] Life you realize he could have just
[2:02:26] showed the Rev Resurrection to you and I
[2:02:29] my brother and sister but he said they
[2:02:31] need a lesson they need to see this
[2:02:33] firsthand and I'm going to take this
[2:02:34] back to building the house some of you
[2:02:36] would say I wouldn't even know what to
[2:02:37] do to build a house but you can be
[2:02:38] showed
[2:02:40] you can be shown that's probably the
[2:02:42] right English word
[2:02:44] showed works
[2:02:46] it's a past test of the shown
[2:02:49] in the double past tense
[2:02:51] you don't know that English did you
[2:02:53] right God's going to show us
[2:02:57] I don't need you to be saved when I come
[2:02:59] to save you
[2:03:00] I need you to be lost when I come to
[2:03:04] save you I don't need you to have your
[2:03:06] own works when I come to save you I want
[2:03:10] you to have no works that you can boast
[2:03:12] of of yourself and then I will give you
[2:03:16] the works of an eternal being amen of a
[2:03:20] resurrection life and I'm going to show
