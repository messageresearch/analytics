[24:38] our god is tremendous man it's been good
[24:40] to you
[24:43] when i'm in need i call on the lord
[24:49] and he hears me
[24:51] yes he helps me

[24:57] and true

[25:33] yes he is almighty
[25:36] he sends his name
[25:38] to guide me
[25:42] there's no storm too powerful our god
[25:45] cannot handle our god and simplicity
[25:49] repent and you and me came down from
[25:53] glory and gave us the victory
[25:57] greatest lust for free
[26:00] [Music]
[26:02] when you're indeed
[26:04] calling the lord
[26:07] and he hears you yes he helps you
[26:12] he is
[26:22] [Music]
[26:24] best friend the only true god there's no
[26:28] one greater
[26:30] wonderful savior
[26:33] jesus
[26:38] [Music]
[26:48] yes he is
[26:50] [Music]
[26:59] our god cannot handle our
[27:02] [Music]
[27:05] and god and me came down from glory
[27:09] gave us a victory
[27:11] greatest love story
[27:16] well my god is tremendous
[27:23] [Music]
[27:35] [Music]
[27:45] glory
[27:47] [Music]
[27:58] amen you know it's good i believe our
[28:00] our lord likes to hear us testify
[28:03] of our feelings um of how we feel about
[28:06] what he's done for us
[28:08] uh giving glory to him and i think
[28:11] that's what he he desires is
[28:14] us to just as it were take a nice deep
[28:16] breath
[28:17] put our vocal cords to work and say
[28:20] thank you lord and praise the lord amen
[28:24] hallelujah good to be here tonight and
[28:27] uh just a lot of things on our mind but
[28:30] um
[28:31] you know sometimes you actually can
[28:33] struggle you know imagine it's you got
[28:35] the picture so full you can't even stir
[28:38] the lemonade
[28:39] and uh that's sometimes how the mind can
[28:42] be you just have so much
[28:44] that you you just don't quite know what
[28:47] to do
[28:48] but uh by god's grace tonight we will uh
[28:51] just kind of a little carry over from
[28:53] last wednesday just didn't you know i
[28:55] thought that was just kind of a thought
[28:57] that we would have and move on but i
[28:59] just found myself
[29:02] in this last week just coming back
[29:04] coming back coming back and so i'd like
[29:07] to speak to you tonight
[29:09] finding wisdom
[29:10] in the will of god
[29:12] and thank you so much amen
[29:15] each one of you
[29:18] just always beautiful just to praise the
[29:20] lord
[29:22] so we're going to be speaking tonight uh
[29:24] finding wisdom in the will of god and
[29:26] and it will touch on tonight
[29:29] and i know it's just very simplistic but
[29:31] remember sometimes we're just stirring
[29:33] up your pure minds in remembrance and uh
[29:36] so tonight we'll just hit a little bit
[29:38] on the difference between wisdom and
[29:39] knowledge
[29:41] because when it comes in the world they
[29:43] would say that's pretty much
[29:44] interchangeable but for sons and
[29:46] daughters of god
[29:48] we realize that
[29:51] there is a very significant difference
[29:55] in that amen let's stand and turn our
[29:57] bibles in the book of james the first
[29:59] chapter
[30:00] uh i've tried to cut out some verses so
[30:02] if it seems like i've kind of just
[30:05] started in a
[30:06] i wouldn't say awkward i don't think
[30:08] there's any place awkward in the
[30:09] scripture but you know if it seems like
[30:12] i kind of started awkward i just wanted
[30:13] to cut out i got quite a bit of
[30:15] scripture i want to be timely tonight
[30:19] james the first chapter starting with
[30:21] verse four
[30:22] but let patience
[30:29] patience
[30:30] we gotta let her have her perfect work
[30:34] my that's
[30:36] i know none of you struggled with
[30:38] patience this last week
[30:40] but um
[30:42] you know
[30:43] isn't it amazing how god chose something
[30:45] like that to
[30:47] be something to wear the edges off of us
[30:50] to fine-tune us to
[30:53] prepare us
[30:55] is that we simply just have to stop and
[30:58] say
[30:59] lord
[31:01] i want to
[31:02] just
[31:03] settle down
[31:05] right all these key ingredients another
[31:07] subject tonight so i don't want to spend
[31:08] too much time on it but oh look at all
[31:10] the key ingredients with that we have to
[31:12] we have to just stop as it were take the
[31:14] big breath
[31:15] and say okay now
[31:17] i wanted it to be that way
[31:20] or this way
[31:22] in this time
[31:24] which is usually right now
[31:28] and then it starts a process i'm talking
[31:30] about holy ghost-filled people it starts
[31:32] a process that we can get started almost
[31:34] as it were have one foot up and a hand
[31:37] on the doorknob and god says whoa whoa
[31:39] whoa
[31:40] there's other factors
[31:42] that i'm going to put in play or take
[31:45] out of play
[31:47] see we oftentimes are looking for what
[31:49] is put into play
[31:52] but how many times is it that god says
[31:54] you know i know satan's got a trap for
[31:56] you
[31:57] he's got some crazy inattentive driver
[31:59] over here that's had in my bottle before
[32:01] noon and he's fixing to run the red
[32:04] light down here the stops
[32:06] sign down here and
[32:07] therefore i want you to stop
[32:12] and just
[32:13] momentary i don't know if you guys ever
[32:14] have this momentary time you feel like
[32:16] just
[32:17] i don't i just feel the catheters yes
[32:20] lord just
[32:21] and you're not even praying for yourself
[32:23] that's right you might be thinking
[32:25] of someone else and used to stop and say
[32:28] oh lord i was thinking about brother so
[32:30] and so he he he kind of looked a little
[32:32] down
[32:33] a couple days ago and lord i just want
[32:36] to remember him and you drive down the
[32:38] hill
[32:39] and you see we often times like oh there
[32:41] was an accident there i think god saved
[32:43] me from the accident but you see the
[32:45] only one maybe that was supposed to be
[32:46] according to the devil's plan
[32:49] was you and them so there is no witness
[32:52] there is no fiery car wreck
[32:54] it was the devil's intent for you to be
[32:57] the fiery car wreck
[32:59] just example saints
[33:02] so that's why we have to let patients
[33:04] have a work and when patient says why
[33:06] don't you just stop and say a prayer
[33:09] that we're not so i'll do that later
[33:11] lord
[33:12] but we can just stop and
[33:14] that's the one side of patience and the
[33:16] other one is the critical molding
[33:19] of the inner man
[33:20] has nothing to do with anything external
[33:24] in other words that's the battle
[33:26] as the prophet declared it greatest
[33:28] battle ever fought
[33:30] that's the one that's being settled
[33:32] up here where we can smile and say god
[33:35] bless you god bless you and the battle
[33:38] is raging
[33:41] and people will never even know
[33:44] because we've become
[33:45] good
[33:47] at hiding that
[33:50] and there's nothing wrong with that
[33:51] right we don't want to come to church
[33:53] and fall down slobbering on the floor oh
[33:56] my life is a wreck
[33:58] but at the same time
[34:00] if satan can seize you up
[34:03] you'll move neither
[34:05] forward or even right or left
[34:07] you'll be froze right in that place
[34:10] but don't worry
[34:12] this work
[34:13] i have begun in you
[34:16] that wasn't a preacher that wasn't a
[34:18] prophet that wasn't a great man of god
[34:20] that was god himself he says i'm going
[34:22] to finish this
[34:23] and so you have to have patience to stop
[34:26] in the middle of your greatest battle
[34:28] and say the lord's coming he's on the
[34:30] scene he's coming there's an answer here
[34:33] he said he would raise a standard and
[34:35] now i'm just going to sit and let god
[34:37] raise a standard
[34:38] amen
[34:40] hallelujah i just preached a whole
[34:41] sermon we could dismiss on that
[34:44] but let patients have a perfect work
[34:46] that you may be perfect and entire
[34:49] wanting nothing now entire means that
[34:51] you are complete
[34:53] if any of you lack wisdom let him ask of
[34:56] god that giveth to all men liberally
[34:59] and upbraideth not in other words he
[35:01] doesn't condemn us
[35:03] for lacking wisdom
[35:05] but we have to ask for it right
[35:07] and it shall be given him but let him
[35:10] ask in faith
[35:12] nothing wavering for he that wavereth is
[35:15] like a wave of the sea driven with the
[35:17] wind and tossed
[35:19] for let not that man think that he shall
[35:22] receive anything of the lord a
[35:24] double-minded man is unstable
[35:27] in just a few things no no no no
[35:32] this double-minded man
[35:35] starts to become unstable in every
[35:39] thing
[35:40] he does yes
[35:45] everything amen
[35:48] heavenly father
[35:49] we just ask you to come tonight lord
[35:51] just allow these thoughts father to
[35:54] lord just reach the heart lord only way
[35:57] it will do that father is if you come
[35:59] and carry them anoint them
[36:01] lord bring them according to thy will
[36:03] father we ask you for all the prayer
[36:05] requests lord and
[36:07] uh just thanking father the bride of
[36:09] christ in the far reaches of the
[36:12] world
[36:14] lord just to see the work that is being
[36:16] done
[36:18] father just ask your lord to lead and
[36:20] guide those brothers and this great work
[36:23] uh printing taking place inside of a
[36:27] pakistan
[36:28] lord right and you know they close the
[36:30] borders to your word and so you've taken
[36:32] your word right inside and printed it
[36:34] within their borders and
[36:36] father these many great works that is
[36:38] being done and i find it so amazing lord
[36:41] how china is cracking down upon
[36:43] christians so hard but yet so greedy for
[36:46] business they will print the gospel
[36:49] lord less expensive than anywhere else
[36:51] in the world and ship it
[36:53] lord you're an awesome god
[36:56] lord it's such a paradox as we look at
[36:58] these things but father we understand
[37:01] that your plan cannot be thwarted lord
[37:03] it cannot be stopped it will come to
[37:06] fruition
[37:07] and lord even if you have to make the
[37:09] devil labor for the bride of christ lord
[37:12] it will be done
[37:13] father we thank you now ask you to bless
[37:15] the service in the name of jesus christ
[37:17] amen you may be seated
[37:21] yeah saints you know i think it's an
[37:23] interesting thing just to kind of put
[37:25] this out as just a little blip of the
[37:27] topic tonight
[37:28] while china is so hard
[37:32] on christians not just message believers
[37:34] but just anyone who is not holding to
[37:37] the three
[37:38] self church and holding two which is the
[37:41] national church you know the uh uh
[37:44] authorized church
[37:46] uh and they're cracking down on them so
[37:48] hard that yet while they are doing that
[37:51] they literally
[37:52] want
[37:53] everyone's money so much
[37:56] that you can go and have a book printed
[37:58] for fractions in china
[38:01] and uh shipped all around the world
[38:03] they'll even do all the logistics for
[38:05] you for less than you could print the
[38:07] book
[38:08] i think it's close to three to one that
[38:10] you can get three books in china shipped
[38:13] for one book printed in the united
[38:14] states i'll tell you what my god's got a
[38:17] sense of humor amen he said okay well
[38:20] the devil don't like the gospel so i'll
[38:22] just make him in his greediness
[38:25] chase this
[38:26] print this package this ship this
[38:30] amen all the while while he thinks he's
[38:32] accomplishing something
[38:34] amen
[38:35] so as we look at this tonight i just
[38:37] want to as i said finding wisdom in the
[38:39] will of god i want to move right into
[38:41] some scriptures here so we can just move
[38:43] on in a timely fashion uh james the
[38:46] third chapter just moving down the book
[38:48] just a little ways 13th verse 3 and 13.
[38:52] who is a wise man and endued with
[38:55] knowledge among you
[38:57] let him show out of good conversation
[39:00] his works with meekness of wisdom so as
[39:03] we're looking at this verse we'll
[39:05] realize my brother and sister because
[39:06] someone would have a great level of
[39:09] knowledge or education or these things
[39:12] that the devil's trying to substitute
[39:14] for revelation in the word of god
[39:16] you know many people rise up and say you
[39:18] know what i i i'm an authority i
[39:21] remember years ago a man making a
[39:23] statement he said um you know people
[39:25] don't know what they're studying they
[39:27] don't know the message i am an authority
[39:30] on the message and you see god will not
[39:33] let these kind of things my brother and
[39:35] sister stay uncontested as it were
[39:38] because
[39:40] god has truth and he's not going to
[39:43] allow his truth to the bride of christ
[39:45] right we're we're talking a very narrow
[39:48] select group of people it's not just
[39:50] truth in general but it's truth coming
[39:53] to the bride right god loves you so much
[39:55] he's so jealous over aren't you glad
[39:58] that he is jealous over you he is so
[40:00] jealous over you that when it comes to
[40:03] the bride of christ anything represented
[40:06] as truth that is not truth he will
[40:08] expose it and as it were i would put it
[40:11] in this way because often times the
[40:13] exposing of truth is actually the
[40:15] destruction of a lie so god will come
[40:18] and literally allow the truth itself in
[40:21] the fact that it cannot be hid will tear
[40:24] down those things that were represented
[40:27] as truth and sometimes it's sad it
[40:29] breaks my heart the destruction of such
[40:32] sometimes is is the undoing of men and
[40:34] their positions and their authorities
[40:37] and influence and etc so we look here
[40:40] and and we take this who is a wise man
[40:42] and endued with knowledge among you
[40:44] now my brothers and sisters will look at
[40:46] these scriptures i want you to catch
[40:48] this i don't want to just preach
[40:49] scripture to you i want you to catch
[40:51] what's behind this tonight because you
[40:53] see a man can declare that he is such a
[40:56] position he can declare that he has such
[40:59] knowledge he has such wisdom he has even
[41:02] in many cases men have tried to claim
[41:04] that they have authority over you
[41:07] right so you can have and men would come
[41:09] and say well i i'm an apostle so
[41:12] therefore you have to now be subject to
[41:15] me well how is it that you're confirmed
[41:18] as an apostle how can you be confirmed
[41:20] as a wise man how can you be confirmed
[41:23] as one with wisdom now let's just look
[41:26] at these scriptures here but if you have
[41:28] bitter injuring so if this man comes in
[41:30] his great wisdom and he calls us any
[41:33] kind of of envying and strife in your
[41:37] hearts
[41:38] you see there's a separation my brother
[41:40] and sister now don't misunderstand this
[41:42] this isn't a brother a a
[41:45] led of the lord to come and speak real
[41:47] direct to you amen now i'm going to pick
[41:49] on brother david tonight okay i won't
[41:51] see him for a week so i got to pick on
[41:52] it now brother david often times he
[41:55] preaches on being born again and that is
[41:58] a very familiar topic our brother david
[42:01] preaches on and you will have people
[42:03] that will feel like we've heard this
[42:05] before but my brother and sister there's
[42:08] no time that god ever wastes his effort
[42:10] or his breath or his time
[42:14] so if it is being ministered on sorry to
[42:16] use you this way brother david but i
[42:18] know that you're tough and and so
[42:20] anytime something like that is being
[42:22] brought out if people will stop and
[42:25] listen is that kind of preaching bring
[42:27] envy and strife in the church the only
[42:30] people who don't like that are the ones
[42:32] who are not examining their own life
[42:35] they're the ones that say how dare the
[42:37] preacher think that possibly and the
[42:40] preacher if he did have a preconceived
[42:42] idea might be looking on the other side
[42:44] of the church
[42:46] but you see it's their own conscience
[42:47] coming down and they're like how dare
[42:49] him preach on me like i don't have the
[42:51] holy ghost if see if they have wisdom
[42:54] and will touch on this a little further
[42:56] if they have wisdom they'll stop and
[42:58] their response will be this
[43:02] lord
[43:03] if this word being preached tonight
[43:05] is for me
[43:07] lord let me open up my heart and receive
[43:10] it
[43:11] and if it's for someone else and i am i
[43:14] am solid in the word i've got the holy
[43:16] ghost then i can lift a hand and say
[43:19] praise the lord the value the benefit
[43:22] the the blessing of being born again oh
[43:25] hallelujah
[43:27] but you see typically when the people
[43:29] get upset is because they think the
[43:31] preacher is judging them
[43:34] and i'm sorry but
[43:35] it's way bigger than the preacher
[43:38] it's so much bigger than the preacher
[43:41] people are actually undercutting god
[43:45] when they come down i hope you don't
[43:46] mind this demonstrative after they're
[43:48] undercutting the move of god in their
[43:50] life when they come and they leave this
[43:55] on the preacher
[43:56] [Music]
[43:57] they've just eliminated god entirely out
[43:59] of their conscience of their effort of
[44:02] their growth
[44:03] are you with me
[44:05] you see my brother and sister
[44:07] unless the preacher
[44:09] would be like
[44:12] oh control yourself paul
[44:15] i was just going to say unless the
[44:16] preacher be like sister carrie them
[44:18] tennis shoes are too blue
[44:22] you know i've been around services that
[44:24] the preacher was that petty
[44:26] that obvious you know what i mean not
[44:28] somebody dressed wrong i mean it's not
[44:29] like sister kerry sitting here with some
[44:31] you know eight or ten inch spiked heels
[44:33] you know and and the preacher just can't
[44:35] contain himself you know
[44:37] we're just talking about things where no
[44:39] we're not talking about that
[44:41] we're talking about god dealing down in
[44:43] the base level of our hearts and souls
[44:45] and and so my brother and sister when
[44:47] the word is preached that is not strife
[44:52] strife is when things are preached that
[44:54] tend to tear apart the fabric
[44:56] of the body of believers because it
[44:59] starts to pull people different
[45:00] directions
[45:02] so you see if one says that he's a wise
[45:04] man but he brings or
[45:06] then bitter envying and strife into your
[45:09] hearts
[45:10] and glory not and lie not against the
[45:13] truth this wisdom descendeth not from
[45:16] above
[45:18] right see the word of god being preached
[45:20] by the holy spirit anointing a man is
[45:23] going to draw people closer to god
[45:26] it's going to bring us to where my
[45:28] brother and sister our hearts cry day by
[45:31] day is lord forgive me and draw me
[45:33] closer had a conversation once with an
[45:35] individual and they were like well you
[45:38] know you're saying forgive me over this
[45:40] little thing but what is it you did
[45:43] see they didn't understand that all i
[45:45] wanted to do is just be right before god
[45:48] they didn't understand that it wasn't
[45:49] really about some kind of markable
[45:51] offense
[45:54] you know go to this day this time this
[45:56] minute this activity see they didn't
[45:58] understand that just wanting to be right
[46:00] before god
[46:01] maybe
[46:02] you have a little envying and strife and
[46:05] you just want to be right
[46:07] before the lord
[46:10] and so people tend to have to have a
[46:11] cause and effect but i'll tell you what
[46:13] the cause and effect is the holy ghost
[46:15] in you is causing you to draw closer and
[46:18] the refiner's fire is purifying you each
[46:20] and every day bringing you closer to a
[46:24] pure relationship with the lord
[46:27] amen so with this wisdom this talking
[46:30] about that brings us envying and and
[46:32] strife and and uh these things uh this
[46:35] wisdom descendeth not from above but is
[46:38] earthly sensual and devilish that's
[46:40] pretty strong words isn't it
[46:42] amen for where envying and strife is
[46:45] there is confusion and every evil work
[46:50] my i tell you what i want to preach the
[46:52] truth to you church i want to preach
[46:53] something i don't have to be ashamed of
[46:56] stand before god of what i represented
[46:58] but i never want to be a tool that would
[47:01] cause this like oh well hallelujah we've
[47:03] got this side versus that side and the
[47:06] front versus the back and these people
[47:08] versus those people my brother and
[47:10] sister we are a body of believers and
[47:12] the only way the body can function is to
[47:14] be connected
[47:17] but there are spirits that would come
[47:18] they seem to specialize in splitting
[47:20] churches
[47:21] they seem to specialize in splitting
[47:24] friendships and fellowship they they
[47:26] seem to work quite well with that makes
[47:28] you wonder here this says that it's
[47:30] earthly sensual and devilish
[47:34] but the wisdom that is from above is
[47:37] first pure
[47:40] okay so it has not been contaminated it
[47:43] hasn't been added to or taken away from
[47:47] it is a pure wisdom and and i hope be
[47:51] patient and god merciful to me tonight
[47:53] we tie this together
[47:55] but this wisdom that is from above is
[47:57] first pure
[47:58] then
[48:00] just exactly the opposite of this other
[48:02] spirit this one is peaceable this is the
[48:06] one that's saying you know what i know
[48:08] there might be a fuss between this
[48:09] family and this family but you know what
[48:11] we're believers we're christian let's
[48:13] pray about it let's come together let's
[48:16] talk this out let's leave our emotions
[48:18] and and all of these things uh on the
[48:20] side here and just get this worked out
[48:22] and you know oftentimes those of you
[48:24] that have talked to me about little
[48:26] different issues you would know that i i
[48:28] am right off the bat my first thought is
[48:30] i don't have an answer so you think oh
[48:33] brother paul might have a little wisdom
[48:35] but actually it is i just simply don't
[48:37] have an answer for you so go home and
[48:38] pray about it
[48:40] that's the safeguard for the preacher
[48:42] you go home and pray about it but you
[48:44] know what through the years many of you
[48:46] have never come back and i have to tell
[48:48] you i'm a curious person and i'm like
[48:50] okay they asked me about something and
[48:53] my advice to them was go pray about it
[48:55] and they never come back and you just
[48:57] want to ask them
[48:59] what happened i have a time or two what
[49:01] happened oh we prayed about it and god
[49:04] gave us the answer
[49:07] i like that it shows that it works
[49:11] it shows that god is hearing the prayer
[49:13] the cry of his saints and and he's
[49:15] giving that my brother and sister you
[49:17] didn't need a priest in the middle of
[49:18] that you didn't need a pastor preacher
[49:20] evangelist or something because we have
[49:22] a direct amen access to the throne room
[49:27] hallelujah
[49:28] amen
[49:30] that that sweet little sister down there
[49:32] well actually sister jerry says she's
[49:34] not as young as she looks but down there
[49:35] in louisiana i don't know if you've
[49:37] heard that song what what is that what's
[49:39] her name jerry
[49:41] haley cross she sings that to having a
[49:44] talking about having direct access to
[49:45] the phone throne room it it's a it's a
[49:48] moving song amen the little girl's got
[49:50] lungs like bigger than i am and and she
[49:53] just sings so beautifully but my brother
[49:55] and sister my point being is we have
[49:58] direct access
[50:00] to the throne room
[50:01] we don't have you know a little deal you
[50:04] know how they have in these big
[50:05] buildings i have a little chart how to
[50:07] get out of the building you go down this
[50:08] hall you turn here you go there you go
[50:11] no we don't have one of them my brother
[50:12] and sister we have direct access to the
[50:14] throne room
[50:16] hallelujah now you still might need to
[50:18] post that in your bedroom so you don't
[50:19] get caught up in all these other things
[50:22] but remembering that i have direct
[50:24] access to the throne room so we're
[50:26] looking now that the wisdom that is from
[50:28] above is first pure then it's peaceful
[50:31] and it's gentle
[50:33] my you don't need to be abused by a
[50:35] preacher you don't need somebody to tell
[50:37] you you're foolish and stupid you know
[50:40] whatever you don't need that my brother
[50:41] and sister that spirit comes from
[50:43] somewhere else amen it's gentle and easy
[50:46] to be entreated in other words you can
[50:49] approach and you can pour your heart out
[50:52] without being ridiculed or
[50:54] beaten down over it
[50:56] isn't this interesting i just love this
[50:58] i i you know i've read the book of james
[51:00] a few times and it just never struck me
[51:02] like this and i look at this and i'm
[51:03] like my i wish i'd remembered this and
[51:05] just held this up now i know this is
[51:07] kind of a rude way to put it but you
[51:09] know maybe if we have this on a mylar so
[51:11] you could look through it you know you
[51:12] could hold it up and be like
[51:15] they flunked
[51:17] yeah that's kind of a rude way to put it
[51:19] but you know they're meaner than a
[51:20] junkyard dog and and they don't really
[51:22] care about you you know uh all these
[51:25] things you know it takes this much to
[51:27] make the preacher mad and then the very
[51:28] next service you're going to hear about
[51:30] it you know my brother and sister i wish
[51:31] i'd had that in my youth i don't know if
[51:33] i'd had courage enough to stood up and
[51:34] said um hey brother so and so you don't
[51:37] pass james 3.
[51:42] but the reality of it is the bride has
[51:44] been given
[51:45] this revelation not for us to criticize
[51:49] not for us otherwise be guilty of the
[51:51] very words we're reading here
[51:52] but it's for us to look and recognize
[51:55] the spirits of our day
[51:57] you see
[51:59] christ didn't come
[52:01] to beat the lamb
[52:03] before he redeemed it
[52:07] you follow me now he is the lamb was
[52:09] beaten but he didn't come
[52:11] to beat us
[52:13] before he redeemed us
[52:15] he come the scripture says to bind up
[52:17] our wounds
[52:19] amen
[52:20] to put
[52:21] amen
[52:22] the salve
[52:23] upon us
[52:25] that our broken hearts and our shattered
[52:28] lives can be put back together
[52:31] amen
[52:35] amen
[52:39] easy to be entreated full of mercy and
[52:41] good fruits
[52:42] without partiality without hypocrisy and
[52:46] the fruit of righteousness is sown in
[52:49] peace of them
[52:50] that make peace
[52:53] amen i want to be one of those kind of
[52:54] people my brother and sister i want to
[52:56] preach the truth to you but i want to
[52:57] preach it in love i want to preach it in
[53:00] such a fashion that when you hear it you
[53:02] know that's the truth and i know that
[53:04] why the way it's been brought to me
[53:06] presented to me is god doing this amen
[53:10] now i want to draw from this if i i can
[53:12] tonight uh the two patterns right
[53:15] there's always two spirits in the
[53:17] framework of the church right and so i
[53:20] want to draw it with that thought in
[53:22] mind draw from this wise in the ways of
[53:24] man
[53:26] or wise in the way of god
[53:30] so i think really it ultimately comes
[53:33] down to these two paths that we are led
[53:35] to amen now we know that uh uh
[53:39] god did not will not ever take you away
[53:42] from his word
[53:44] right so god's not going to say oh i'm
[53:46] going to let them go over here and do
[53:48] this and do that and i'm going to just
[53:49] draw them away from the word my brother
[53:51] and sister brother branham is very clear
[53:53] about that that the word is in you
[53:57] amen
[53:58] and you are in the word
[54:01] so he cannot separate you because that
[54:04] would be pulling the word itself apart
[54:06] and so it would be god taking a part of
[54:09] himself and as it were ripping it out of
[54:11] himself and casting it away so god will
[54:14] never lead you away from the truth
[54:17] and so
[54:18] we're either going to become wise in the
[54:20] ways of man or wives in the ways of god
[54:22] and wise in the ways of man produces the
[54:25] spirit of the age now you can find
[54:28] several references of brother brown not
[54:30] in these exact words but if you just
[54:32] study and keep that in the back of your
[54:34] mind you'll find many references of what
[54:36] brother branham branham's talking about
[54:37] that and uh he talks about it on the
[54:39] positive side that these men could only
[54:42] preach the word for their day so i would
[54:45] take it now this is just my reading of
[54:47] the word so don't don't get too
[54:49] excited or wound up with this but i read
[54:51] some of what brother branham says there
[54:53] and i kind of see myself maybe just a
[54:56] little shadow that some of these men
[54:59] actually had more revelation than god
[55:02] called upon them to preach in their day
[55:04] so in other words god put them to a
[55:06] certain place and said stop right here
[55:09] and i take a little reference back to
[55:11] talking about the mercy seat and coming
[55:13] to that and saying but we won't speak
[55:15] about that in particular at this time
[55:18] was it they were totally void of
[55:20] knowledge no i believe god was there we
[55:22] can see a reference of john uh looking
[55:25] into uh the book of revelation looking
[55:27] into the time
[55:29] and uh god telling him to seal it up
[55:32] he had revelation he had the word he
[55:35] could have as it would have been left to
[55:37] his own device he would have been
[55:39] revealing in that day mysteries that
[55:41] were meant to be revealed in this day
[55:43] and so god says no close up the book
[55:45] don't write that so i i kind of myself
[55:48] hold just a little bit not a big deal
[55:50] but just a little bit that many of these
[55:52] men of god through the ages actually had
[55:55] a little greater revelation than god
[55:57] anointed them to preach in other words
[55:59] they themselves might or heard a voice
[56:00] saying seal it up
[56:02] now just because god never put it down
[56:04] in scripture that he told them that but
[56:06] he would anointed those men the season
[56:08] is not right don't preach that and these
[56:10] are godly men god spoke to these men god
[56:12] used these men the supernatural took
[56:14] place in their ministries but god says i
[56:16] have a season i have a time for this
[56:19] mystery as it were to be fully revealed
[56:22] and i'm not going to throw it out and
[56:23] give the devil all this time to chip
[56:26] away at it
[56:28] now it seems like in the day we live
[56:30] right now the devil's had plenty of time
[56:31] to chip away on it but imagine the
[56:33] results he would have if he had had you
[56:35] know a thousand or so years or something
[56:38] so you look at that and realize now the
[56:40] wise and the ways of man produces the
[56:42] spirit of the age second timothy uh
[56:46] three
[56:47] this know also that in the last days
[56:49] perilous times shall come so this is not
[56:52] speaking of middle dark ages right look
[56:54] pretty perilous to me right i s when i
[56:56] study history and i study the dark ages
[57:00] to me that would qualify that's perilous
[57:02] times but you know that ox anointing god
[57:05] brought that down upon those men and
[57:06] women and even children and and they
[57:09] were under that anointing and imagine
[57:11] now as we said here and we our minds
[57:13] would say oh my how could they do that
[57:17] under that anointing they were just like
[57:19] i have to give my life for the gospel
[57:22] no problem
[57:23] here i am but you see in this last layer
[57:26] to see an age here we'll see my brother
[57:28] and sister it's another type of giving
[57:30] your life for the gospel right at this
[57:33] point in time we don't know what the
[57:35] future will hold uh what god has wrapped
[57:38] up you might say in his word but at this
[57:40] time right now the word of god actually
[57:42] declares that the great battle that we
[57:44] fight in this day is greater than it was
[57:48] in the dark ages
[57:50] so there they gave their life's blood
[57:52] even the stories that were there that
[57:54] they wanted to stand at the stake don't
[57:55] even time me don't chain me i'll just
[57:58] stand here i won't be running away and
[58:00] you know history shows they never did
[58:01] that again because in the midst of being
[58:03] burnt to a crisp they lifted their hands
[58:05] and their mouths open and the people
[58:07] there said they were worshiping
[58:10] and the devil said oh my i never thought
[58:14] these people would be so anointed they
[58:16] should have been scribed
[58:18] screaming and crying in agony begging
[58:21] they should have
[58:22] instead
[58:24] catch these things that's right how
[58:26] strong
[58:28] the anointing was
[58:30] the anointing overcome
[58:33] that evil of the age it overcome the
[58:36] effects of fire it overcome all of these
[58:38] things and you know what they could not
[58:41] comprehend in that day how people could
[58:44] choose willingly
[58:46] to go there but don't look at that and
[58:49] say my that just gives me the shivers
[58:52] i want you to realize there's more
[58:53] anointing
[58:54] in our day
[58:56] than there was
[58:57] then
[58:59] there's more power of god revealed in
[59:02] the bride of christ today than there was
[59:05] then
[59:07] oh my brother and sister you say how can
[59:09] you say that brother paul because the
[59:11] power of god is a revealed word
[59:14] amen they had the word for their day and
[59:16] it was sufficient thereof
[59:19] now look at this know also that in the
[59:21] last days perilous times shall come for
[59:24] men shall be lovers of their own selves
[59:26] covetous boasters proud blasphemers
[59:29] disobedient to parents unthankful unholy
[59:33] without natural affection truce breakers
[59:35] false accusers incontinent fierce
[59:37] despisers of those that are good
[59:40] traitors heady highminded lover of
[59:43] pleasure more than lovers of god
[59:45] having a form of godliness
[59:48] but denying the power thereof from such
[59:52] turn away
[59:54] don't entertain them there's too many
[59:56] people have this idea well you know what
[59:58] if we just rub shoulders with these
[1:00:00] spirits maybe we can convince them
[1:00:05] no you've got to get through the
[1:00:06] anointing that's on them first before
[1:00:08] you'll ever get to them and that
[1:00:09] anointing is actually my brother and
[1:00:11] sister stronger than we are that's why
[1:00:14] we have to be sealed with the holy ghost
[1:00:16] to face the spirits of the age
[1:00:19] you don't go brother brown talks about
[1:00:20] going down india and these different
[1:00:22] places and all those spirits and he said
[1:00:24] unless you know where you stand i'm
[1:00:25] paraphrasing this unless you know where
[1:00:27] your stand don't go there
[1:00:29] because you're talking about spirits
[1:00:31] that are so powerful
[1:00:33] but you look at this now i want you to
[1:00:35] see and i'm going to throw something
[1:00:36] that's semi-political in here and i hope
[1:00:38] you don't mind but my brother and sister
[1:00:40] look in the world we live in today uh
[1:00:42] governor of the state of new york the
[1:00:45] man declared himself literally almost
[1:00:47] verbatim in words here back a couple
[1:00:49] years ago he was invincible as a
[1:00:51] governor and he could probably reign as
[1:00:53] long as he wanted to and because he
[1:00:55] fought he had so much sway with the
[1:00:57] people but you see we find how that god
[1:01:01] can take and this spirit of the devil
[1:01:04] which thinks that it has free reign to
[1:01:06] do anything he wants god comes along and
[1:01:08] says you know what your season
[1:01:10] now let's take this i'm not going to
[1:01:12] name them all but you can take this back
[1:01:13] in the bible of all these kings that
[1:01:16] thought they were equivalent or greater
[1:01:18] than god and they thought that they were
[1:01:20] going to rule forever and then poof
[1:01:22] they're gone
[1:01:23] and so now we have this same thing being
[1:01:25] manifested in our day rulers
[1:01:29] with an unclean
[1:01:31] kingdom
[1:01:33] and god says
[1:01:34] i remove you
[1:01:39] now the
[1:01:41] what is that movement
[1:01:43] the me movement or whatever that was you
[1:01:45] know where women were coming out being
[1:01:47] more vocal and
[1:01:49] whatever i forget what that was called
[1:01:52] why didn't this take place
[1:01:54] seven years ago when that movement first
[1:01:56] started
[1:01:57] yeah he's been doing it for 20 years
[1:02:02] now is the time
[1:02:04] that's right
[1:02:05] the season
[1:02:06] it wasn't about enough women of enough
[1:02:08] credible character to come and derail
[1:02:11] this
[1:02:12] it's the season
[1:02:14] it's a time and god says now
[1:02:17] for everything there's a season
[1:02:19] and now there's a season that i'm moving
[1:02:21] this now is it all about we're going to
[1:02:23] have justice and equality no sir
[1:02:26] no sir brother branham told us they
[1:02:28] rejected jesus christ and this country
[1:02:31] is doing nothing but going downhill and
[1:02:34] what scares me is you know when an
[1:02:36] airplane first starts to dive
[1:02:38] um you know they don't make a whole lot
[1:02:40] of noise brother david's flown uh i've
[1:02:41] been on a plane a few times they don't
[1:02:43] make a tremendous noise right when they
[1:02:45] start to dive but when they've picked up
[1:02:47] maximum speed and that thing's
[1:02:48] fluttering and shaking they start making
[1:02:50] some strange noises and our nation is
[1:02:53] starting to make some strange noises so
[1:02:55] it's tipped over from this as it were uh
[1:02:58] you know people were angry when barack
[1:03:00] obama said the united states was not a
[1:03:02] christian nation and it just went from
[1:03:04] border to border uh people just angry
[1:03:06] that it's not but you know he told the
[1:03:08] truth
[1:03:10] he actually was telling the truth
[1:03:17] so what is this
[1:03:18] this is describing the nature
[1:03:21] of our nation
[1:03:23] right here
[1:03:25] and you say well brother paul um i don't
[1:03:27] know i mean
[1:03:29] is that right would would that be
[1:03:32] look right here in our wonderful little
[1:03:33] city of boise
[1:03:35] they create their own phone number
[1:03:38] for you to turn in your neighbor
[1:03:42] for doing uncovered like behavior
[1:03:46] which uncovered like behavior is where
[1:03:48] you check your brain in
[1:03:50] and you just do what they tell you
[1:03:52] that's uncovered like behavior
[1:03:54] so people in boise had experiences of
[1:03:56] having family over for a birthday party
[1:03:58] in their backyard and the police coming
[1:04:00] and bashing the gate open and coming in
[1:04:02] there and telling them disperse an hour
[1:04:03] will arrest you
[1:04:05] right here in our town
[1:04:07] see so this is the world it is see this
[1:04:09] is what was happening in this day in the
[1:04:11] dark ages if you if you go into a fox's
[1:04:14] book you'll look in there and realize it
[1:04:16] was neighbor against neighbor family
[1:04:18] member against family member we have a
[1:04:19] promise of that in our day saints
[1:04:22] we have a promise that that is still
[1:04:23] going to come
[1:04:25] okay i need to hurry along here i said
[1:04:26] i'm not going to elaborate on all of
[1:04:28] this because you guys are so we have
[1:04:31] right here in second timothy 3 just a
[1:04:33] picture of wise in the ways of men amen
[1:04:37] now wise in the ways of god let's turn
[1:04:39] into first corinthians 3 18
[1:04:42] let no man deceive himself
[1:04:45] oh lord help us because i'm telling you
[1:04:47] saints i've embraced this statement for
[1:04:49] years now that the greatest fool is the
[1:04:52] fool who fools himself amen so let no
[1:04:55] man deceive himself if any man among you
[1:04:57] seemeth to be wise in this world let him
[1:04:59] become a fool
[1:05:02] that he may be wise for the wisdom of
[1:05:04] this world is foolishness with god for
[1:05:07] it is written he taketh the wise in
[1:05:10] their own craftiness
[1:05:14] we're seeing that happen every day
[1:05:17] and again the lord knoweth the thoughts
[1:05:19] of the wise that they are vain therefore
[1:05:22] let no man glory in men for all things
[1:05:26] are yours whether paul or apollos or
[1:05:28] cephas or the world or life or death or
[1:05:31] things present or things to come all are
[1:05:35] yours and he was obviously just talking
[1:05:36] to somebody way back there in history
[1:05:38] that we'll never meet
[1:05:40] no sir he was talking to you and i
[1:05:43] he was telling us your rightful position
[1:05:46] of sons and daughters of god is not all
[1:05:49] in the millennial
[1:05:50] in the millennium we're going to this
[1:05:52] and we're going to that my brother and
[1:05:53] sister sons and daughters of god are
[1:05:55] going to take authority on the earth
[1:05:57] right now amen the word shows us so
[1:05:59] clearly footsteps are possession and i
[1:06:02] want to know what did you claim
[1:06:04] what are you claiming or are we sitting
[1:06:06] back and saying well i'm just going to
[1:06:08] sit here until until
[1:06:10] until
[1:06:12] you see there's a difference of
[1:06:13] following a directive of the word
[1:06:16] or coming to a situation where you need
[1:06:18] god to reveal his will to you amen see
[1:06:20] many times god's already gave us the
[1:06:22] answer we either kind of don't like the
[1:06:24] answer or we haven't been diligent
[1:06:26] enough to study the scripture to know
[1:06:27] that the answer is plainly before us
[1:06:31] are you okay with that
[1:06:33] i i firmly believe that's the truth many
[1:06:35] times we have just simply glossed over
[1:06:37] and said i don't see the answer but the
[1:06:39] answer lies right there before us
[1:06:43] so
[1:06:44] close that out ye are christ
[1:06:47] and christ
[1:06:48] is god's
[1:06:50] so here again see we are in christ
[1:06:53] and he has all authority in all
[1:06:55] possession and all ownership
[1:06:58] and we're in him
[1:07:00] we don't need to sit back and say devil
[1:07:02] is it okay
[1:07:04] devil can can you just give me a little
[1:07:07] time a little whatever
[1:07:09] no
[1:07:11] it's yours
[1:07:12] and you've been given the authority to
[1:07:15] apply that
[1:07:16] to your life and your family
[1:07:19] your church
[1:07:20] and literally to every ministry and
[1:07:22] whatever that's a
[1:07:26] part now
[1:07:29] i've heard it said that wisdom is
[1:07:31] knowledge
[1:07:32] but you'll look at this and realize i i
[1:07:34] should have maybe had this to put up on
[1:07:36] the screen but i'm just going to take
[1:07:39] uh the definition of wisdom the very
[1:07:41] first line that they put up here
[1:07:43] uh is a knowledge that is gained by
[1:07:46] having many experiences in life
[1:07:49] now my brother and sister we can say
[1:07:50] well this is a wise man
[1:07:53] but what really matters to you and i is
[1:07:55] wisdom in the things of god it's not
[1:07:57] really that we're wise that we can look
[1:07:59] at charts of the stock market and say oh
[1:08:02] you know in three weeks this will go up
[1:08:03] or down right brother scott see it's
[1:08:05] something it's that's a science that's
[1:08:07] something you know people like me
[1:08:09] wouldn't i wouldn't have a clue but you
[1:08:11] study those and you see that that's
[1:08:12] wisdom my brother and sister and there's
[1:08:15] wisdom many of you would probably be a a
[1:08:17] little bit nervous about going out and
[1:08:19] taking you know 40 50 60 70 000 worth of
[1:08:23] seed and putting it in the ground and
[1:08:24] hoping everything would grow i have
[1:08:26] wisdom i learned it the hard way but you
[1:08:28] know that's how a lot of that comes but
[1:08:30] you see we want to look at this now
[1:08:32] wisdom coming in the ways of god wisdom
[1:08:36] comes by the experience of the triers
[1:08:39] trials you go through fiery trials
[1:08:41] that's why he says you know don't get
[1:08:43] all depressed and shook up and tore up
[1:08:45] about these fiery trials you're going to
[1:08:46] face because you're gaining wisdom and
[1:08:49] we start to see that satan's tactics we
[1:08:52] start to see how satan would do my
[1:08:54] brother and sister and then we start to
[1:08:56] recognize okay now this happens satan
[1:08:59] tries to come and follow this and so we
[1:09:01] start and we gain this this wisdom in
[1:09:04] this and it is not really our wisdom
[1:09:06] it's not wisdom that we personally have
[1:09:09] gained but it's actually us growing in
[1:09:12] christ so as he is working in our life
[1:09:15] this is part of the mystery of christ
[1:09:17] being revealed my brother and sister he
[1:09:19] knew the devil when he saw him
[1:09:24] and that's a problem many times people
[1:09:26] have they don't know the devil when they
[1:09:27] see him he comes so camouflaged he comes
[1:09:30] in such a way presents himself in such a
[1:09:32] deal then people trip over that but you
[1:09:35] see i want you to think about your life
[1:09:38] think about what god's doing the holy
[1:09:40] ghost in you is causing satan to his
[1:09:43] camouflage is being taken away
[1:09:47] and we're starting to see and and it
[1:09:48] doesn't mean you don't make mistakes but
[1:09:50] one of the things about making mistakes
[1:09:52] is correcting it as soon as possible and
[1:09:54] that's one of the angles that the devil
[1:09:55] likes to use right because if we have if
[1:09:58] our heart condemns us not then we have
[1:10:00] confidence in god so satan comes along
[1:10:02] and just keeps giving us this
[1:10:03] condemnation pill and we don't know what
[1:10:05] it is so we just keep taking it and i've
[1:10:07] known people that once delivered from
[1:10:09] that said i've went years
[1:10:11] in the message
[1:10:13] under a cloud of
[1:10:14] condemnation but when they got delivered
[1:10:17] they're like never going back
[1:10:19] never going back i realized that what
[1:10:21] did they do they grew up
[1:10:24] they recognized they're in christ it's
[1:10:26] not in today and out tomorrow or in this
[1:10:28] evening and out by midnight my brother
[1:10:30] and sister we are christ and christ is
[1:10:33] god's so look take what the prophet of
[1:10:36] god said he names off all the different
[1:10:38] deity all the different names and he
[1:10:40] says this is all god
[1:10:43] so you belong to god god's in you you're
[1:10:45] in god
[1:10:47] amen
[1:10:48] seems pretty simple but some people
[1:10:50] struggle
[1:10:52] now going down in the full definition of
[1:10:54] wisdom it says accumulated philosophic
[1:10:58] or scientific learning
[1:11:00] and right behind that it puts the word
[1:11:01] knowledge
[1:11:04] you see how it
[1:11:06] separates those even though they're so
[1:11:08] close in definition now let's just go to
[1:11:10] knowledge itself it's information it's
[1:11:12] understanding it's a skill you get from
[1:11:14] experience or education an awareness of
[1:11:17] something
[1:11:18] a state of being aware
[1:11:20] of something
[1:11:22] now my brother and sister i want to put
[1:11:23] this if i
[1:11:24] can being aware that god is moving
[1:11:28] is not the same
[1:11:30] as being part of god's movement
[1:11:35] amen too many people are aware that god
[1:11:38] is moving
[1:11:40] but they're not
[1:11:42] in the
[1:11:43] wisdom
[1:11:45] experience
[1:11:46] to be in the movement
[1:11:50] that will be the difference between an
[1:11:52] intellectual
[1:11:54] in revelation
[1:11:55] revelation puts you into the very move
[1:11:58] of god
[1:12:00] intellectual
[1:12:01] makes you aware that god is moving
[1:12:06] did that come out okay it come out much
[1:12:08] better earlier today when i preached to
[1:12:10] myself
[1:12:12] i i that's one thing i just dislike you
[1:12:14] know it just seems to flow when you're
[1:12:16] in the shower
[1:12:19] or the tractor
[1:12:21] but see people going to get caught in
[1:12:22] another reality my brother and sister
[1:12:24] where they feel like because they know
[1:12:26] brother brown said this in this message
[1:12:28] and he said this in this message and
[1:12:30] before this time he preached it this way
[1:12:32] and at this time god dealt with him and
[1:12:33] now he preaches it this way and we do
[1:12:35] that and they can lay that all out and
[1:12:36] so they're aware that god is moving they
[1:12:38] can put a timeline they can put all of
[1:12:40] these things to it but come right down
[1:12:42] in the day that we're living right now
[1:12:44] and look back and say
[1:12:46] yeah this has to happen or that has to
[1:12:48] happen or this is and the word that they
[1:12:50] believe they understand is saying no
[1:12:52] it's it's me god in you
[1:12:55] right and so now you know we were just
[1:12:58] discussing this the other day
[1:13:01] how do we
[1:13:02] digest the prophet of god talking about
[1:13:06] us
[1:13:07] being able to speak another world into
[1:13:10] existence and go live on it
[1:13:13] see most of us just immediately i i
[1:13:16] don't mean to put the blanket the most
[1:13:19] is not you
[1:13:20] it's the others
[1:13:22] most of us just shut off on that because
[1:13:25] we can't comprehend
[1:13:26] anything even resembling
[1:13:30] speaking another world into existence
[1:13:36] but do you know what the bride's doing
[1:13:40] the bride right now this has so many
[1:13:42] avenues saints and it could get a little
[1:13:44] convoluted but the bride right now is
[1:13:47] standing on this place we call earth
[1:13:50] but we have spoken
[1:13:51] another world
[1:13:53] into existence
[1:13:56] right here
[1:13:57] we are not in a world
[1:14:01] oh my that's right hallelujah you guys
[1:14:04] got anything to do till midnight
[1:14:07] we are not
[1:14:09] in satan's eden
[1:14:11] we are in another world
[1:14:15] no i'm not explaining how what the
[1:14:17] prophet of god said i'm just telling you
[1:14:18] the reality of this is those things that
[1:14:21] are not as though they are and those
[1:14:22] things that are as though they are not
[1:14:24] and the bride is not sitting here going
[1:14:26] oh my goodness the nation is going
[1:14:29] bankrupt we knew it was going bankrupt
[1:14:31] it's prophesied to go bankrupt in fact
[1:14:34] we might actually find ourselves going
[1:14:36] hallelujah it's going bankrupt
[1:14:38] because that means we're one step closer
[1:14:41] and so the reality of it is we've
[1:14:43] stepped into a world that god
[1:14:47] our lord jesus christ
[1:14:49] is the ruler of
[1:14:51] see he's the ruler of satan's eden he's
[1:14:54] got it all encompassed he's got it all
[1:14:56] wrapped up it's working quite well for
[1:14:57] him but the bride has stepped into
[1:14:59] another place and there's several
[1:15:01] avenues we could take off of that
[1:15:03] tonight but it's not really my topic so
[1:15:05] i just want you to look at this you see
[1:15:07] the world's going to declare that you
[1:15:08] are caught in a different reality an
[1:15:11] alternative reality or a false reality
[1:15:14] but my brother and sister i'm going to
[1:15:16] take the bible over what man science
[1:15:18] this that and the other has got to say
[1:15:20] about anything i'm simply going to take
[1:15:22] the word of god because in my own life
[1:15:24] now let's go back to wisdom that is from
[1:15:27] experiences
[1:15:29] can we say tonight god's given us some
[1:15:31] wisdom
[1:15:32] amen we know god answers prayer we know
[1:15:34] god is in control we know that even when
[1:15:37] we fall god's right there to catch us
[1:15:39] and wrap his arms around us and say my
[1:15:41] son my daughter i'm right here have
[1:15:44] confidence trust me we know these things
[1:15:47] and so we're not sitting here blindly
[1:15:49] looking out saying well there's a god
[1:15:51] he's far off we don't know maybe he's
[1:15:53] out beyond the eagle nebula
[1:15:56] no sir
[1:15:58] he's right here
[1:16:00] in our midst in fact the word says he's
[1:16:02] in me he's in you
[1:16:05] so our reality is the reality of the
[1:16:07] word coming to pass
[1:16:09] now let's look in the queen of sheba
[1:16:11] here
[1:16:12] there is uh
[1:16:14] a little bit let me explain this brother
[1:16:15] branham here and the queen of sheba is
[1:16:17] sharing
[1:16:18] of a conversation he was having with a
[1:16:20] rabbi
[1:16:21] and uh so i cut right into this so
[1:16:24] you can go look and read the rest
[1:16:26] about
[1:16:28] that
[1:16:29] for the sake of time
[1:16:31] brother brown says
[1:16:32] because he's talking to him about the
[1:16:34] truth and the man's acknowledging
[1:16:35] there's truth there acknowledging that
[1:16:38] that jesus christ had to be a prophet
[1:16:40] that's as far as he could get but you
[1:16:42] know had to be so then
[1:16:43] under that if he's a prophet he can't
[1:16:45] lie
[1:16:48] see
[1:16:48] they they would recognize that as a
[1:16:50] prophet
[1:16:51] of god
[1:16:52] he couldn't lie
[1:16:54] so therefore they had to listen to it
[1:16:56] okay
[1:16:57] he said i'd rather be down there begging
[1:17:00] and drinking branch water then eating
[1:17:01] chicken three times a day and my name in
[1:17:03] gold on this temple here and no i was in
[1:17:07] air
[1:17:08] i'd rather be truthful and he started to
[1:17:11] cry
[1:17:13] and he turned around and said i'll see
[1:17:14] you later and i said you're not honest
[1:17:16] with me rabbi
[1:17:18] and he said i believe if them temple
[1:17:20] priests would have listened to him we'd
[1:17:22] be better off today
[1:17:24] and i said then you believe what about
[1:17:26] it he said i believe he was a good man i
[1:17:29] said rabbi do you believe he was a good
[1:17:30] man said i go further than that with you
[1:17:33] i believe he was a prophet i said that's
[1:17:35] all i want you to say
[1:17:37] then he said he was the son of god
[1:17:40] and then if he was a prophet he can't
[1:17:42] lie so therefore you believe he was the
[1:17:45] prophet the son of god he showed the
[1:17:47] sign of the messiah now look my brother
[1:17:50] and sister what i'm going to bring out i
[1:17:52] don't want to get myself
[1:17:54] all tangled up here
[1:17:56] let me just finish this and he wouldn't
[1:17:58] talk to me no more he went in the place
[1:18:01] oh brother
[1:18:04] what that love of money will do
[1:18:07] what a love of some ecclesiastical form
[1:18:10] will do but this now if i could have the
[1:18:14] liberty tonight to put a giant
[1:18:16] separation here
[1:18:18] because these two are not connected
[1:18:21] this is a man telling him
[1:18:24] if ice spoke that
[1:18:28] i would be out on the street
[1:18:30] that's what was above where i started
[1:18:32] brother i'm saying well i'd rather be
[1:18:34] i'd rather be doing that than be where
[1:18:36] you're at because you know the truth
[1:18:41] so
[1:18:42] let's put a gap in here almost like draw
[1:18:44] this and put it down here because it's
[1:18:46] not even connected with this man
[1:18:49] but what the love of god will do then to
[1:18:52] a heart
[1:18:53] that's willing to surrender to the will
[1:18:56] and the ways of god amen
[1:19:02] let's find wisdom in this quote saints
[1:19:04] let's find wisdom
[1:19:06] here's a man who has studied the
[1:19:09] scriptures
[1:19:10] has made an acknowledgment we would be
[1:19:12] better off if they had listened he has
[1:19:15] to be a prophet brother branham puts it
[1:19:18] to him well son of god the man does not
[1:19:20] deny that but he can't get over
[1:19:24] that 401k
[1:19:26] the house he lives in the cory drives
[1:19:34] his life experience
[1:19:37] was not enough to compel him
[1:19:41] to pursue christ
[1:19:45] he had knowledge
[1:19:48] he did not
[1:19:49] have wisdom
[1:19:56] that's kind of a heartbreaker isn't it
[1:19:58] yes
[1:20:00] i pray god don't let don't let us lord
[1:20:02] in this church and those around us lord
[1:20:05] don't let us come to the place that we
[1:20:07] have knowledge
[1:20:09] but we don't have wisdom that's right
[1:20:13] we don't have enough life experience now
[1:20:15] since i don't like to be negative and i
[1:20:17] actually don't bring these things in a
[1:20:18] negative light but there's people that
[1:20:20] said i'm done with this message and walk
[1:20:22] away my brother and sister they had
[1:20:24] knowledge
[1:20:27] they had a knowledge but they didn't
[1:20:29] have the experience
[1:20:32] to back it up
[1:20:34] i pray even if you're crying out saying
[1:20:37] oh lord have mercy on me the trials are
[1:20:39] too great i i pray i'd rather see you
[1:20:42] there and god come on the scene then god
[1:20:45] just answer and make it all peachy for
[1:20:46] you
[1:20:48] because it's going to take a real
[1:20:50] experience
[1:20:51] a real wisdom my brother and sister as
[1:20:54] it comes down says to be so close to
[1:20:56] deceive the very elect and people are
[1:20:58] like well you know the pentecostals are
[1:21:00] this and this is over here and that's
[1:21:01] and and they're preaching the message i
[1:21:04] listen to those things they are
[1:21:05] preaching the message
[1:21:08] what's that got to do with it because
[1:21:09] the deception's not going to be whether
[1:21:11] the upc is preaching the message or not
[1:21:13] the deception is going to be right here
[1:21:15] in our message church
[1:21:17] that's where it's at
[1:21:26] you see the real wisdom
[1:21:31] this this could be contested so please
[1:21:33] don't judge me harshly here
[1:21:35] the real wisdom
[1:21:37] is in god's will
[1:21:39] you see if we are walking in god's will
[1:21:43] god cannot allow you to walk in his
[1:21:47] perfect will and then condemn you that
[1:21:50] your walk was not good enough
[1:21:53] he can't do it my brother and sister not
[1:21:56] the path that men say god told me to
[1:21:58] walk in but the one that god led us to
[1:22:01] which would be according to the word
[1:22:04] wouldn't miss a drop see there's no
[1:22:06] wisdom
[1:22:08] just thinking of this man brother
[1:22:09] brown's song did there's no wisdom in
[1:22:11] pressing against the word of god
[1:22:14] and there's no wisdom in pressing
[1:22:16] against the will of god
[1:22:19] brother branham ties it together and
[1:22:20] says
[1:22:21] god's will
[1:22:23] is his word
[1:22:26] so people are saying well i disagree
[1:22:28] with that but i'm in the will of god no
[1:22:30] no impossible
[1:22:32] impossible saints you cannot be out of
[1:22:35] the word and claim to be in the will
[1:22:40] it won't work
[1:22:43] there again now i'm not calling any man
[1:22:45] a fool scripture says not to do that but
[1:22:47] i'm telling you the worst thing in a way
[1:22:50] is the fool who fools himself so he says
[1:22:52] i i disagree with those things that paul
[1:22:55] preached but i'm in the will of god
[1:23:04] you know
[1:23:05] the lady with the raspy voice that's on
[1:23:07] television that
[1:23:09] has a big church
[1:23:11] i can't think of her name right at the
[1:23:13] moment
[1:23:14] joyce meyers
[1:23:17] i listened to an interview
[1:23:20] with joyce meyers
[1:23:23] where she says she had pastored the
[1:23:25] church for years
[1:23:27] before someone come to her
[1:23:29] and showed her in the scripture where
[1:23:32] she didn't have a right
[1:23:33] to do what she was doing
[1:23:38] but she's still doing it
[1:23:42] because she said after that she prayed
[1:23:44] and god revealed to her
[1:23:52] it's nothing short of a lie now okay i'm
[1:23:54] not picking on joyce meyers the woman
[1:23:56] actually has some very inspirational
[1:23:57] thoughts and whatever i mean if that's
[1:23:59] where you shop
[1:24:03] you know i mean even walmart has some
[1:24:05] good stuff on the shelves
[1:24:10] i shouldn't have said that brother tim
[1:24:11] works at walmart they support him
[1:24:14] but anyway
[1:24:17] but you see you come down and you say
[1:24:19] well
[1:24:20] okay god spoke to me
[1:24:23] you realize we're not saying that god
[1:24:25] said you're special and i'm making
[1:24:27] exemption for you you're actually saying
[1:24:29] god's a liar
[1:24:32] so we can't go against the word of god
[1:24:36] and even come close to making a
[1:24:37] declaration we're in the will of god
[1:24:48] so first corinthians
[1:24:50] are we okay kind of kind of okay i gotta
[1:24:53] hurry
[1:24:54] first corinthians two
[1:24:55] now lengthy and let let us just go
[1:24:58] through this quickly and brother when i
[1:25:00] come to you i came not with excellency
[1:25:02] of speech so don't don't be thinking i'm
[1:25:04] some really intellectual guy or of
[1:25:07] wisdom now you see this wisdom just like
[1:25:10] i spoke to you the other day sometimes
[1:25:12] you can have these words that seemingly
[1:25:15] now there's a contradiction but you have
[1:25:17] to take the whole big picture of this
[1:25:21] because he's talking now as it would be
[1:25:23] a man who would come and say i was part
[1:25:26] of the sanhedrin
[1:25:28] and i have spent 30 years studying these
[1:25:31] things
[1:25:32] and god speaks to me
[1:25:35] you see there's a whole nother avenue
[1:25:37] we're just touching on the edge of it
[1:25:38] whole another avenue of presenting it
[1:25:40] he's saying i i didn't come to you as
[1:25:42] some kind of intellectual authority
[1:25:47] declaring unto you the testimony of god
[1:25:52] do you realize now i just want to touch
[1:25:53] on this again i i keep saying i'm not
[1:25:55] going to do this but i just have to my
[1:25:56] brother and sister the only way one can
[1:25:58] declare the testimony of god is to get
[1:26:01] in where the testimony is at
[1:26:04] the testimony of god is not to go out
[1:26:06] and say god's in the church over there
[1:26:08] and god's in a church over there and
[1:26:09] god's in nature and god no to be able to
[1:26:13] truly share the testimony of god you
[1:26:17] have to figuratively if you want to call
[1:26:19] it that climb into the ark because
[1:26:22] that's where the testimony is at yes
[1:26:25] the testimony is not out on the street
[1:26:26] corner
[1:26:27] the testimony is not revealed of god
[1:26:30] after you got home from a night of
[1:26:31] dancing
[1:26:36] for i determined not to know anything
[1:26:38] among you
[1:26:40] save jesus christ and him crucified
[1:26:42] i like preachers like that yes they
[1:26:44] don't need to do homework they don't
[1:26:46] need to go around it's like what's going
[1:26:48] on with gabriella
[1:26:50] no sir
[1:26:52] they can just go pray
[1:26:53] and if something is preached and it
[1:26:55] touches her life she can have confidence
[1:26:58] with god talking to me
[1:27:00] and young people i want that to be your
[1:27:03] story when you grow up
[1:27:05] it wasn't as though you know i think
[1:27:07] sometimes that's where where you know
[1:27:09] preachers kids
[1:27:10] and grandkids have a problem because you
[1:27:12] know they're around
[1:27:14] uh they're around the preacher all the
[1:27:16] time and they kind of feel like well
[1:27:18] that wasn't really god speaking to me
[1:27:20] that was my dad or my grandpa
[1:27:26] cancel that idea we have cancer culture
[1:27:28] in the world today and we ought to do we
[1:27:29] ought to join i've joined the council
[1:27:31] culture do you know that the devil said
[1:27:33] this i canceled them the devil did this
[1:27:35] i cancelled them amen the devil tried to
[1:27:38] raise this up i canceled them
[1:27:40] amen
[1:27:43] so he said i determined not to know
[1:27:44] anything among you
[1:27:46] i didn't go snoop your lives i didn't go
[1:27:48] spied and peek over your back fence i
[1:27:51] only wanted to know one thing among you
[1:27:52] saved jesus christ and him crucified
[1:27:54] because if we get christ in our midst
[1:27:56] paul had a revelation that's all it
[1:27:59] takes
[1:28:00] no special this no special that just get
[1:28:03] god our lord jesus christ in our midst
[1:28:06] and the problems are solved
[1:28:08] and i was with you in weakness and in
[1:28:10] fear man this is not the guy i thought
[1:28:12] he was
[1:28:14] and in fear and in much trembling
[1:28:16] and my speech and my preaching was not
[1:28:18] with enticing words of man's wisdom but
[1:28:21] in the demonstration of the spirit and
[1:28:24] of power that your faith should not
[1:28:26] stand in the wisdom of men right now
[1:28:29] this is why saints i really wanted to
[1:28:31] drill that to you down there we're
[1:28:32] either going to have this wisdom that is
[1:28:34] in the ways of man or wisdom in the ways
[1:28:38] of god and the apostle paul is laying
[1:28:40] this down here i don't want your faith
[1:28:43] standing in any form or fashion in the
[1:28:46] wisdom of men
[1:28:48] but i want it to be built in the power
[1:28:50] of god
[1:28:52] howbeit we speak wisdom among them that
[1:28:54] are perfect see a whole nother wisdom
[1:28:57] this is where i got my thought out of
[1:28:59] this a whole nother wisdom we've got
[1:29:01] this wisdom of men and i don't want you
[1:29:03] to be built in this but we have another
[1:29:05] wisdom over here we got a wisdom that is
[1:29:08] this supernatural wisdom we got a wisdom
[1:29:10] amen that i speak of among them that are
[1:29:13] perfect yet not the wisdom of this world
[1:29:15] nor of the princes of this world that
[1:29:18] come to naught
[1:29:19] amen
[1:29:21] i don't know about you but i get excited
[1:29:23] about this
[1:29:24] but we speak the wisdom of god in oh no
[1:29:27] here's a mystery
[1:29:31] the thing we don't like about mystery
[1:29:33] saints as a minister as a pastor is i
[1:29:35] can't
[1:29:36] go downstairs or wherever the coffee
[1:29:38] machine is and print off
[1:29:41] the mystery
[1:29:42] and just hand it out to you all
[1:29:47] you're going to have to pray
[1:29:49] you don't have to be diligent
[1:29:52] you're going to have to the scripture
[1:29:53] says sigh and cry
[1:29:56] you're going to have to seek after
[1:29:58] the scripture says even with bitter
[1:30:00] tears
[1:30:02] in other words you're going to have to
[1:30:04] pursue this mark of the high calling
[1:30:06] you're not going to be able to stand
[1:30:07] there on the curb and say ah hi calling
[1:30:10] hi calling
[1:30:17] mystery even hidden wisdom
[1:30:20] which god ordained before the world into
[1:30:23] oh i love this
[1:30:25] he just do you see my name up there
[1:30:28] i see your name up there
[1:30:30] amen
[1:30:31] all in those three letters he included
[1:30:33] us right into this
[1:30:35] he put us right in here ordained before
[1:30:38] the world unto our glory which none of
[1:30:41] the princes of this world knew none of
[1:30:43] them will know your glory
[1:30:46] amen for had they known that they would
[1:30:48] not have crucified the lord of glory
[1:30:51] but as it was written i hath not seen
[1:30:53] nor ear heard neither have entered into
[1:30:54] the heart of man the things which god
[1:30:56] hath prepared for them that love him
[1:31:00] but god hath revealed unto them
[1:31:03] uh hath revealed them unto us by his
[1:31:06] spirit for the spirit searcheth all
[1:31:09] things yea
[1:31:11] the deep things of god i want to tell
[1:31:13] you when you get in the spirit and you
[1:31:15] are desiring answers and leadership from
[1:31:18] god this is not a you know how you put
[1:31:21] something into the search on the
[1:31:22] computer and they're so proud of
[1:31:25] themselves you push enter and bing
[1:31:27] things pop on the screen and it tells
[1:31:29] you to come up with 100 uh
[1:31:31] 1123 and 0.54 of a second
[1:31:38] but you look through all that and they
[1:31:40] don't have all the information
[1:31:45] they gave you
[1:31:47] what was the pre-loaded version
[1:31:49] of the most sought
[1:31:51] or
[1:31:52] what somebody paid them
[1:31:55] to put me at the top
[1:31:57] of the list
[1:32:01] this might seem silly to you forgive me
[1:32:04] but you see
[1:32:06] he's revealed them to us by spirit
[1:32:10] for the spirit searcheth
[1:32:13] all
[1:32:14] things
[1:32:15] yea

[1:32:18] deep
[1:32:19] oh can i emphasize that to you
[1:32:21] not the super how do i come closer to
[1:32:24] god
[1:32:26] how do i live an overcoming life
[1:32:29] no sir it searches the deep
[1:32:32] and it starts to deal in that life and
[1:32:34] it starts
[1:32:35] spitting these things out of the spring
[1:32:38] it starts washing it starts preparing
[1:32:40] because we're dealing with the deep
[1:32:42] things amen we're not dealing with
[1:32:44] superficial i was a christian until i
[1:32:46] got discouraged i was a christian until
[1:32:48] this happened i was a christian to have
[1:32:50] the deep things and down in the deep
[1:32:53] things is the mysterious thing and the
[1:32:55] mysterious things is the revelation
[1:32:57] which the word showed was god in you in
[1:33:00] this hour manifesting not talking about
[1:33:02] the word not reading about the word
[1:33:05] manifesting the word that the very life
[1:33:08] that is jesus christ is now inside of us
[1:33:12] coming for and my brother and sister
[1:33:15] that's deep
[1:33:17] that's deep
[1:33:19] hallelujah
[1:33:20] amen not the superficial i attend the
[1:33:24] big church down here i'm on the softball
[1:33:26] deal and i'm on the dance committee and
[1:33:28] i'm on the food committee and i'm on
[1:33:29] this i'm a christian
[1:33:32] no sir
[1:33:33] an anointing oh if i can tie this back
[1:33:36] to you an anointing so strong then in
[1:33:39] such a wicked age that we live in
[1:33:42] anointing so strong that would cause a
[1:33:44] man or a woman to say i'll serve god
[1:33:47] with every last breath of my body and if
[1:33:50] i have to say forgive me lord a thousand
[1:33:53] times i'll say it a thousand times and i
[1:33:56] will move forward because i know that
[1:33:59] the deep things of god was christ coming
[1:34:01] down in me and manifesting in a day that
[1:34:05] is so intellectual
[1:34:08] but has completely missed god
[1:34:16] god hath revealed them unto us by spirit
[1:34:18] for the spirit searcheth all things yea
[1:34:19] the deep things of god for what man
[1:34:22] knoweth the things of a man save the
[1:34:24] spirit of a man which is in him
[1:34:27] even so the things of god knoweth no man
[1:34:30] but this spirit
[1:34:32] of god
[1:34:33] you know what's taking us saints
[1:34:35] into the deep things of god
[1:34:37] into the mystery of god
[1:34:39] god himself
[1:34:41] and i'm telling you you know they made
[1:34:43] movies years ago i never watched them i
[1:34:45] just knew that they were there about the
[1:34:47] tombs in egypt and you know the guides
[1:34:50] taking them down doors that slide and
[1:34:52] hidden this and whatever
[1:34:55] sounds scary
[1:34:58] but you know what's scarier than that
[1:35:00] is a person trying to lead himself
[1:35:04] into the path of righteousness in
[1:35:06] laodicea
[1:35:08] that's more scary than any scary movie
[1:35:10] about tombs in egypt
[1:35:12] is a person that would say oh i have a
[1:35:15] revelation
[1:35:19] what is your revelation doing
[1:35:22] what's it saying what's it producing
[1:35:27] you know i dealt with some individuals
[1:35:29] quite some time back
[1:35:31] and they literally looked me in the face
[1:35:32] and said we do like do not like you
[1:35:34] using the word
[1:35:36] manifested manifesting
[1:35:43] um i i guess i'm not bright enough to
[1:35:45] understand this
[1:35:49] we don't like it
[1:35:52] well you know my mother had to beat it
[1:35:54] out of me or tried to when i was little
[1:35:56] there's some little streak in paul
[1:35:58] i'm still dealing with the lord's deal
[1:36:00] with me trust me just you know pray for
[1:36:01] me
[1:36:02] but you tell paul he can't and there's
[1:36:05] just something inside of me
[1:36:07] that says
[1:36:08] well just watch
[1:36:12] and i didn't do this intentionally but i
[1:36:14] found myself
[1:36:18] manifested manifesting
[1:36:20] going to manifest have manifested
[1:36:23] here is the manifestation
[1:36:25] i'm sorry i can't help it
[1:36:27] because you see that's the very evidence
[1:36:29] of god in me
[1:36:31] if i say god's in me and you can't see a
[1:36:35] single shred of evidence that god is in
[1:36:38] me
[1:36:39] we've got a problem
[1:36:42] well
[1:36:43] i do for sure
[1:36:47] so
[1:36:49] what knoweth
[1:36:50] the things of god
[1:36:53] knoweth no man let me get this right
[1:36:54] amen even so the things of god knoweth
[1:36:57] no man but the spirit of god
[1:37:00] amen
[1:37:01] god's opening the bible to you
[1:37:04] that's god
[1:37:05] he's your personal tutor kids
[1:37:08] you know kind of how mom maybe helps you
[1:37:10] home school or whatever it might be you
[1:37:12] got a personal tutor and god's saying
[1:37:14] right here look at this mystery
[1:37:16] look at the word that's me
[1:37:18] but i'm here with you see i'm showing
[1:37:20] you that i'm on the written page but i'm
[1:37:22] also
[1:37:23] in you
[1:37:27] hallelujah
[1:37:29] now we have received
[1:37:32] so there's been some receiving going on
[1:37:34] he's making acknowledgment there's been
[1:37:36] some receiving going on
[1:37:38] now we have received not the spirit of
[1:37:41] the world but the spirit which is of god
[1:37:43] that we might know the things that are
[1:37:45] freely given to us of god
[1:37:48] oh my brother and sister i hope you can
[1:37:50] see this you see
[1:37:52] with the mind
[1:37:59] i forgot to put it in the list
[1:38:01] i'm sitting there looking going up that
[1:38:02] scripture
[1:38:03] but you see the apostle paul says we
[1:38:06] have
[1:38:07] the mind
[1:38:09] of christ
[1:38:11] you realize with the mind of christ
[1:38:14] comes wisdom amen
[1:38:17] do you realize my brother and sister
[1:38:20] it's true wisdom amen
[1:38:22] and with that wisdom
[1:38:25] by experience
[1:38:28] we see the mystery of god
[1:38:31] not
[1:38:32] an educated
[1:38:34] declaration
[1:38:36] of historical and
[1:38:38] future tense
[1:38:41] but the
[1:38:42] real
[1:38:43] life
[1:38:45] god
[1:38:47] manifesting
[1:38:49] himself
[1:38:50] day by day
[1:38:54] i think i'm getting i'm getting
[1:38:56] you might say wiser
[1:38:58] every day
[1:39:01] because part of it is
[1:39:03] oh i hope you guys don't mind this humor
[1:39:05] i'm getting more and more to the place i
[1:39:07] can just tell myself shut up
[1:39:12] and if i have to i'll slap myself and
[1:39:14] make myself shut up
[1:39:17] because you see
[1:39:18] by nature this great battle going on
[1:39:22] we declare things
[1:39:24] we don't want to declare
[1:39:27] prophet of god says don't say those
[1:39:29] words i'm weak
[1:39:31] i'm not i'm going to put it to this to
[1:39:33] you i hear this what i feel like is way
[1:39:35] too much and it comes out of my own
[1:39:36] mouth once in a while
[1:39:38] i'm not worthy
[1:39:41] god knows you're not worthy
[1:39:43] you don't have to remind him
[1:39:45] the truth of it is that's actually the
[1:39:47] devil's language
[1:39:48] that's the devil one of you because
[1:39:50] you're hearing yourself
[1:39:52] you're hearing yourself and you're
[1:39:54] believing yourself that i'm not worthy
[1:39:56] i'm telling you he said you're worthy
[1:39:58] so the wisdom that comes from having the
[1:40:01] mind of god
[1:40:02] amen is the fact that you have not
[1:40:05] received the spirit of the world but the
[1:40:08] spirit which
[1:40:09] is of god has come to you there is
[1:40:12] wisdom my brother and sister to
[1:40:14] recognize who we are in the day that
[1:40:17] we're living in a world that is
[1:40:18] declining rapidly around us
[1:40:22] there's only one thing that's holding us
[1:40:25] only one thing
[1:40:28] only one thing
[1:40:32] god
[1:40:34] himself our lord jesus christ
[1:40:38] now the prophet of god you know he puts
[1:40:40] it he says you talk about the holy ghost
[1:40:42] you talk about jesus christ you talk
[1:40:43] about uh el shaddai you talk about it's
[1:40:46] all gone
[1:40:47] it's all gone my brother and sister
[1:40:49] don't get all confused on who's in you
[1:40:51] and what's in you god's come he's
[1:40:53] manifested himself he meets every need
[1:40:55] in every situation and you stand right
[1:40:58] there and you can say well well i don't
[1:41:01] know but let's go back to the dark ages
[1:41:03] amen sister ruth if you had come
[1:41:06] let's go to the dark ages
[1:41:10] who is with
[1:41:12] them
[1:41:13] that were sawn asunder
[1:41:16] who was with them
[1:41:19] that were burnt at the stake
[1:41:22] who was with them
[1:41:24] that was throwed
[1:41:26] into the colosseum
[1:41:27] with the angry hungry animals
[1:41:36] it's the same god
[1:41:39] hallelujah if i could dance i'd dance
[1:41:42] right now
[1:41:43] same god
[1:41:45] is living
[1:41:46] in you and i
[1:41:49] not another form not another
[1:41:50] dispensation not another time the same
[1:41:53] god amen oh hallelujah doesn't that make
[1:41:56] your hearts happy tonight
[1:41:58] amen you know
[1:42:00] i i
[1:42:02] i tried to do really well
[1:42:03] and and we're doing really well i'm
[1:42:05] going to call this i'm finished okay so
[1:42:07] you can clock that in right now
[1:42:09] amen
[1:42:10] but i'm telling you
[1:42:12] this is just
[1:42:14] scratching
[1:42:16] oh yeah this surface
[1:42:18] it is so beautiful
[1:42:20] oh my it would be just like lord i'd
[1:42:22] like to have the encyclopedias that go
[1:42:24] with that and it'd be like bam
[1:42:26] everything would be covered up because
[1:42:28] there's so
[1:42:29] much amen
[1:42:31] and that's not even
[1:42:34] a touch
[1:42:35] of christ in you
[1:42:37] oh hallelujah
[1:42:39] you can look you can read you can speak
[1:42:41] you can sing you can testify but look at
[1:42:44] the power of god in you amen darkest age
[1:42:47] saints that's what the word says most
[1:42:49] corrupt age that's what the word says
[1:42:52] amen it's the time the season
[1:42:55] everything coming together
[1:42:57] but as
[1:42:59] the scripture says
[1:43:01] i brought you out of darkness
[1:43:03] now let's just not go back to the
[1:43:05] fringes of darkness
[1:43:07] and look out there and say now i wonder
[1:43:09] what's happening
[1:43:11] out there
[1:43:12] hello we're in the light
[1:43:14] let's just look around in the light
[1:43:16] forget the darkness put the darkness
[1:43:18] behind you look around in the light
[1:43:20] because i tell you what every once in a
[1:43:22] while
[1:43:23] i click on that news stuff
[1:43:26] and it's just disheartening
[1:43:29] i mean
[1:43:30] they're just like we're going to destroy
[1:43:32] you the devil's on a rampage we're going
[1:43:34] to conquer everybody we're going to this
[1:43:35] we're going to do that and those of you
[1:43:37] that like to burn gasoline you know now
[1:43:39] they want to tax you for every mile you
[1:43:41] drive but to do that they're going to
[1:43:42] have to be able to tap into your phone
[1:43:44] and know everywhere you went and if
[1:43:46] they're inside your phone well forget
[1:43:47] that
[1:43:50] we might actually go back to a homeless
[1:43:52] society
[1:43:54] because i can see people just chunking
[1:43:56] them out the window
[1:43:58] we might go back saints
[1:44:00] to a more primitive life i don't know
[1:44:03] i don't know what it'll be and i don't
[1:44:05] really care
[1:44:06] because i'm not standing here looking
[1:44:08] into the darkness
[1:44:10] i'm looking into the light
[1:44:12] and the light said he's coming for me
[1:44:15] the light said if i'll just keep my life
[1:44:17] washed and under the blood
[1:44:19] in his presence he's coming for me and
[1:44:22] just like that little story of that
[1:44:23] little girl you know the the butcher
[1:44:26] that you know what
[1:44:28] my you didn't see her when they could
[1:44:29] hear hear a a wagon coming across the
[1:44:32] prairie out there you didn't see her
[1:44:34] going 300 miles an hour trying to find
[1:44:37] this and find that stuff it all in a bag
[1:44:39] no sir
[1:44:41] when she heard the wagon
[1:44:43] and they all are like who's coming
[1:44:46] she just took that little suitcase and
[1:44:47] she walked out
[1:44:49] because she knew who was coming for her
[1:44:51] it was the right day
[1:44:54] and the right time
[1:44:56] and even regardless of that
[1:44:58] it was the right promise
