[36:55] this i can do this i believe the message
[36:57] i can do this you've got to go put your
[36:59] hand in his hand
[37:01] and every doubt that you have don't be
[37:03] ashamed to say i had doubts
[37:05] come on saints this morning we got to
[37:07] just be honest with ourselves
[37:09] we've had doubts we've had things that
[37:10] have sidetracked us we've had things
[37:12] that derailed us and we're there but the
[37:15] thing is
[37:16] is just like thomas we have to come and
[37:18] say you know what
[37:19] i've got to see jesus and i don't want
[37:21] to just see jesus i want to put my hand
[37:23] in his
[37:24] end i want to know and god is faithful
[37:30] oh amen just to forgive us
[37:34] of our doubts of our weaknesses
[37:37] is it good be in the house of the lord
[37:39] today hallelujah
[37:43] hallelujah other thoughts in my mind but
[37:47] i believe i'll just leave them to rest
[37:49] hallelujah i want to speak to you this
[37:51] morning once again on redemption's
[37:53] manifestation
[37:55] i didn't have them put this on the title
[37:57] page because there's just way too many
[37:59] things there
[38:00] but my brother and sister we just want
[38:02] to look at this once again
[38:04] as a part of our thought of our call to
[38:07] action
[38:08] amen so you see when something moves
[38:12] you either respond or you don't
[38:17] now let me phrase that in a different
[38:19] fashion you either
[38:20] accept see sometimes we water this down
[38:24] god bless you it's good to see you back
[38:26] in the house of the lord
[38:27] amen you see what happens is we water
[38:32] things down and bring it to a place we
[38:36] say
[38:36] oh i just disagree
[38:44] come on i want you to ponder that
[38:48] it doesn't work that way you either
[38:51] accept or you reject
[38:56] there's no i disagree
[39:01] we either accept what the word says or
[39:04] we reject what the word says
[39:07] the bible clearly shows us to reject
[39:09] even one word
[39:13] is that loss to our soul
[39:16] you see we got to come down and get a
[39:18] reality saints just like our nation is
[39:20] living in a fairy tale that it can spend
[39:23] trillions of dollars and has nothing to
[39:25] back it
[39:25] up but it doesn't matter we already have
[39:28] prophecy we already have the word of the
[39:29] lord
[39:30] that our nation's bankrupt we see that
[39:32] now if 40
[39:33] 50 years ago they were spending money
[39:35] that could not be repaid in the next 40
[39:37] years
[39:38] what are they doing now but i don't want
[39:40] you to be concerned about that
[39:42] because it says in the scripture that
[39:44] when you see that day coming
[39:46] look up rejoice your redemption draws
[39:49] nigh
[39:49] this must this must happen the world
[39:51] must be degraded
[39:53] it must come why is our states excuse me
[39:56] while i just touch on this
[39:57] why are states now having to pass laws
[40:01] that say you can't teach perversion
[40:04] to our children in school
[40:07] should never even be a question should
[40:10] never even come to the forefront
[40:12] but you see the corruption has come to
[40:14] the surface
[40:16] and now there's still a remnant you
[40:18] might say of people that are pushing
[40:20] back and saying
[40:21] no you can't teach our children these
[40:22] perverted things in school
[40:26] why because prophecy
[40:29] must be fulfilled
[40:33] now i i need to remove that little
[40:35] lingering
[40:37] that just got left in your mind prophecy
[40:40] must be fulfilled
[40:41] and the word said there would be sons
[40:43] and there would be daughters that would
[40:45] reach out and take a holds of the word
[40:47] and be so hungry for the things of god
[40:49] that they would be willing to sacrifice
[40:51] even their very
[40:52] life for it but we live in a day my
[40:55] brother and sister
[40:56] while it's happening in places around
[40:58] the world that there is direct
[40:59] persecution of christians i want you to
[41:01] realize that living
[41:03] in the world we live in right now you
[41:06] dying to the gospel is you pushing back
[41:09] against the cares of life
[41:11] is you pushing back against the flesh
[41:14] you pushing back against
[41:15] all of the spirit that would come and
[41:18] make you
[41:18] a lukewarm believer
[41:23] because remember they're the ones that
[41:24] get spewed out they're part of the plan
[41:26] right they're right there in the
[41:27] scripture right
[41:28] they're they're just as much of the
[41:29] scripture as you are my brother and
[41:31] sister
[41:32] but they're spewed out
[41:36] and you get to hear the words well done
[41:37] my good and faithful servant
[41:39] well now lest i depress all of you some
[41:41] of you are frowning at me and looking
[41:43] sad let's just stand and go right into
[41:45] this scripture i want to speak to you
[41:46] today on
[41:47] room for growth amen it's a lovely
[41:50] thought i hope that it
[41:51] stirs your heart as it has mined this
[41:54] last week
[41:55] as we have been just pondering and
[41:57] studying
[41:58] uh it was it was nice i was appreciative
[42:01] of
[42:01] brother chris i just felt like the lord
[42:04] opened that door
[42:05] uh you know to have him speak this last
[42:08] wednesday
[42:09] because there's a time that even the
[42:11] preacher needs to sit on the pew
[42:13] and hear the word preached amen and so
[42:16] it was just to me it was very timely a
[42:18] real blessing to me
[42:20] and uh so this week i've been able to
[42:22] just ponder
[42:24] uh this thought just focus entirely upon
[42:26] this thought and
[42:28] i had a hard time i must admit this
[42:30] morning uh
[42:32] putting the final you might say uh uh
[42:34] thoughts to
[42:35] to the page but we'll ask and have asked
[42:38] the lord's blessings
[42:39] upon this first peter the second chapter
[42:43] 1 through 10. amen
[42:46] certainly greet all of you my brother
[42:49] carl
[42:50] and sister chrissy zeller greets the
[42:54] church
[42:54] amen brother carl was sharing with me
[42:57] a little video clip of
[43:00] how that now uh certain in the eastern
[43:05] part of the united states and in europe
[43:07] they're now coming out with atm machines
[43:09] that have several forms of id
[43:13] that you can use one of them will be
[43:15] your eye
[43:16] your palm print your identification
[43:19] card or even your vaccination
[43:22] card my brother and sister
[43:26] here again don't get depressed
[43:30] look up your redemption draw nigh
[43:34] the scripture said you won't buy or sell
[43:36] without that mark
[43:38] well praise the lord i've been marked i
[43:41] have been marked
[43:43] oh thank you lord the prophet of god
[43:45] said now it will be
[43:47] giving your will or your life your
[43:48] agreement to to their work
[43:51] it will not be a microchip it will not
[43:53] be it might be in the forehead
[43:55] but that's because you have turned not
[43:57] you they
[43:58] let me rephrase that they have turned
[44:01] their thoughts in agreement
[44:02] but i want you to look at this my
[44:04] brother and sister you're marked this
[44:05] morning
[44:06] the holy ghost has come down just as
[44:08] sure as a death angel went down through
[44:11] egypt and down through goshen my brother
[44:13] and sister everyone that had the blood
[44:15] over the doorpost
[44:16] that death angel passed right over that
[44:18] household why
[44:19] they were marked by the blood and we
[44:21] stand here as a people this morning
[44:23] marked by the blood of jesus christ we
[44:26] have put it over the doorpost of our
[44:28] life we have put it over our lintel
[44:30] my brother and sister that surely as god
[44:32] looks down upon it
[44:34] and he will send judgment on the earth
[44:36] he has already marked sons and daughters
[44:38] of god
[44:38] and they are receiving you see we say
[44:41] well it's not the mind it's not the mind
[44:43] it's not intellectual but your intellect
[44:45] plays a part
[44:46] your intellect hears the word of god
[44:48] preach processes
[44:52] and the heart is what punctuates it with
[44:54] amen
[44:56] hallelujah because the mind can argue
[44:59] the points
[45:00] but the heart responds to the word
[45:05] first peter 2 1 and 10.
[45:08] we're for laying aside all malice can we
[45:10] agree with that yes
[45:12] all guile i say all hypocrisies
[45:15] and envies in all evil speakings
[45:20] as newborn babes desire the sincere milk
[45:23] of the word
[45:25] that ye may grow thereby
[45:29] if so be ye have tasted that the lord is
[45:31] gracious can anyone hear this morning
[45:33] say you have actually
[45:35] tasted that the lord is gracious i would
[45:37] hope every hand would be raised this
[45:39] morning
[45:40] to whom cometh as unto a living stone
[45:43] disallowed indeed of men but chosen
[45:46] of god and precious
[45:50] ye also as lively stones are built up a
[45:54] spiritual house
[45:55] a holy priesthood hood and to offer up
[45:59] spiritual sacrifice
[46:00] acceptable to god by jesus christ
[46:03] wherefore also it is contained in the
[46:06] scripture
[46:06] behold allah and zion achieve
[46:09] cornerstone
[46:10] elect precious and he that believeth
[46:14] on him shall not be
[46:17] confounded now look at this my brother
[46:20] and sister the scripture tells us let me
[46:22] interject this right now
[46:24] the scripture tells us that it will come
[46:26] to a time that the people will be
[46:29] in gross darkness that's right
[46:32] now i'm going to just take it because i
[46:34] don't want to get sidetracked here
[46:36] but we'll see in this scripture my
[46:38] brother and sister through the ages god
[46:41] used gross
[46:42] darkness to confound the people
[46:45] times in scripture when they come in
[46:46] such a darkness they wandered around
[46:49] bumping into things and knew not where
[46:51] they went
[46:53] now you look at it we're living in a
[46:55] time that is in gross
[46:56] darkness and you say now now this kind
[46:59] of has a political overtone forgive me
[47:01] but i want you to catch this how it has
[47:03] to be expressed
[47:06] they in gross darkness are making
[47:08] decisions and doing
[47:10] things that we are saying how can they
[47:12] do that
[47:13] how that is insanity what are they
[47:16] thinking what are they doing
[47:17] and inherently we would say they must
[47:19] just be evil people
[47:22] but do you understand that they're in
[47:24] gross darkness
[47:27] and they're confused and confounded and
[47:30] in their mind it has perfect clarity
[47:38] but there's a man here who has already
[47:42] turned on the light we're not waiting
[47:45] for the light to be turned on look my
[47:46] brother and sister you can go out here
[47:48] in denomination and they talk about
[47:50] jesus christ they talk about
[47:52] the blood they sing some of the same
[47:54] songs we do they read the same
[47:55] scriptures
[47:56] and they go out and live a life that is
[47:58] confounding to the scripture
[48:01] because of darkness
[48:07] somebody ought to say thank you lord
[48:10] yeah
[48:13] ye as lively stones are built up a
[48:15] spiritual house
[48:17] and holy priesthood to offer up
[48:19] spiritual sacrifice
[48:20] acceptable to god by jesus christ
[48:24] wherefore also it is contained in the
[48:26] scripture behold i lay in sign a chief
[48:28] cornerstone
[48:29] elect precious and he that believeth on
[48:33] him shall not be
[48:37] confounded oh i'll tell you somebody
[48:40] might say well they sound arrogant they
[48:41] sound pompous they sound this they sound
[48:43] that
[48:44] no i like what was said here it is not
[48:46] arrogant
[48:47] we have confidence in our god amen we
[48:50] have confidence in his word
[48:52] and he has shown the light on that word
[48:54] and the word is speaking back
[48:56] to you and i yes oh thank you lord unto
[48:59] you therefore which believe
[49:02] he is precious see without belief my
[49:06] brother and sister it's
[49:07] nothing precious but unto them which be
[49:10] disobedient
[49:12] the stone which the builders disallowed
[49:14] the same as made the head of the corner
[49:17] and a stone of stumbling and a rock
[49:21] of a fence
[49:26] i saw a little video clip i'm sorry to
[49:28] keep you standing
[49:29] but i just want to interject these
[49:30] things i saw a little video clip
[49:34] this young man is going to college
[49:39] he's a christian not afraid to express
[49:43] what he believes
[49:48] and he's done a little research he might
[49:49] say
[49:51] what it is so there's somebody else
[49:53] standing by obviously because he's not
[49:55] holding the phone filming this
[49:58] and almost to a person everyone that he
[50:01] encounters
[50:02] that he starts a conversation he
[50:05] interjects
[50:06] jesus christ in the conversation
[50:09] jesus christ jesus christ jesus christ
[50:12] and almost to the person
[50:15] you can see them go
[50:21] and many at the mention of jesus christ
[50:24] turn on their heel and walk away
[50:33] they've rejected the cornerstone
[50:37] and it's become offensive
[50:40] to them
[50:46] a rock of offense even unto them which
[50:48] stumble
[50:49] at the word being disobedient whereunto
[50:52] also
[50:52] they were appointed
[50:56] but don't you just love how the word of
[50:58] god comes
[51:00] it always puts this right there to
[51:02] remind you and i
[51:03] who we are but ye
[51:06] hallelujah somebody say it with me ye
[51:10] are a chosen generation
[51:13] a royal priesthood a holy nation a
[51:16] peculiar people
[51:18] that ye should show forth the praises of
[51:20] him who hath called you
[51:22] out of darkness out of confusion
[51:25] out of oh hallelujah
[51:29] called us out of my brother and sister
[51:31] into his
[51:32] marvelous light which in time past were
[51:35] not a people but are now
[51:37] the people of god which had not obtained
[51:40] mercy
[51:40] but now have obtained mercy
[51:44] heavenly father lord just ask you lord
[51:46] this morning just give us clarity of
[51:48] thought
[51:49] lord let us be concise and precise to
[51:52] preach your word
[51:53] lord as we speak this i ask lord that
[51:55] you would just bless the hearts of your
[51:56] children today
[51:58] in the name of jesus christ amen may be
[52:02] seated
[52:05] as we look at these scriptures my
[52:06] brother and sister we could kind of put
[52:08] this in the context of
[52:10] peter is laying a foundation now it is
[52:13] the word of god speaking no matter where
[52:16] you stand right
[52:18] if you are disobedient the word speaks
[52:21] of you
[52:21] if you are called into the marvelous
[52:24] light
[52:24] the word is speaking of you but i
[52:26] believe as we look through the bible we
[52:28] will find
[52:29] that the word of god is especially
[52:32] precious
[52:33] amen to the believer it is there that we
[52:36] look and realize my brother and sister
[52:38] we're not living in a world i do not
[52:40] live sometimes in the flesh god forgive
[52:42] me
[52:42] saints forgive me sometimes we'll say a
[52:45] word comes across
[52:46] negative uh it's not my heart amen as
[52:48] god deals with us
[52:50] as we get closer to the throne it is not
[52:52] in our heart to speak ill of
[52:54] others and sometimes it is this a nature
[52:57] that we
[52:58] have as humans that we we tend to say
[53:00] things that they don't come out right
[53:02] sometimes we're trying to make a
[53:03] reference point but yet it seems as
[53:05] though
[53:05] we just criticized someone god forgive
[53:08] us for
[53:08] for that uh you know that we don't want
[53:10] to be caught up in that because i'm not
[53:12] here
[53:13] it is not my desire to to
[53:17] focus on the negative as it were that is
[53:19] in the world today but
[53:21] we're called to look into the word of
[53:23] god now you can take the scripture my
[53:25] brother and sister if you want to be the
[53:27] naysayer or negative person
[53:28] and you can draw out of the scripture
[53:30] how that it will be
[53:32] that there is going to be virtually no
[53:34] one saved and
[53:35] and you know woe unto us and uh how can
[53:38] this be
[53:39] and what must we do oh it just doesn't
[53:41] seem possible
[53:42] or you can look at the word and realize
[53:44] that you were chosen to be that
[53:46] generation
[53:47] you were chosen to be the ones that are
[53:49] holy and righteous before god
[53:51] that you were there and then let that be
[53:53] the expression
[53:54] of your life amen you know it is there
[53:57] that
[53:57] many times you know the attitude of what
[54:00] we deal in the world around us
[54:02] has an influence on us and and i mean
[54:04] this by
[54:05] if you hang out with optimistic people
[54:08] you will be optimistic if you hang out
[54:10] with negative people you will be
[54:12] negative
[54:12] and so it's there my brother and sister
[54:15] that i just desire that we as a group of
[54:17] believers christians
[54:18] would not look sometimes we have to
[54:20] recognize the facts of the world around
[54:22] us and the facts of people's behavior
[54:24] but my brother and sister let's look at
[54:27] the good that is around us let's look at
[54:29] the good
[54:29] in one another and i bring this out in
[54:32] this fashion
[54:33] because you see and i'm ahead of myself
[54:35] and i'm just going to go ahead and
[54:36] express it
[54:37] all through this scripture we see those
[54:39] that have come short
[54:40] we might say of the glory of god and if
[54:43] we lock
[54:44] them into that position
[54:49] we give them no room for growth
[54:56] [Music]
[54:58] a pastor could look out on a
[54:59] congregation and say well i
[55:01] i see what this one's done and i've seen
[55:03] what that one's done and
[55:05] and we can preach and we can do all of
[55:07] this but if we don't give room for
[55:09] growth that person will always be the
[55:11] liar the thief the whatever
[55:14] are you with me
[55:17] the word of god always gives us room for
[55:19] growth
[55:21] god has never constrained us that what
[55:23] you was is what you will always be but
[55:26] the blood this precious blood
[55:28] amen has come to tell us that we
[55:32] are alive because he is alive
[55:35] and we have been delivered because that
[55:37] is his power
[55:38] that is his plan that is his uh that is
[55:41] him
[55:42] amen and so if we are not careful we can
[55:45] lock someone into a position
[55:47] and not give them any room for growth
[55:50] amen but you look at this now you see
[55:54] because no matter where you stand but
[55:55] especially the believer
[55:57] god has called you to grow into a
[56:00] position
[56:01] you see the very scriptures that we were
[56:03] there amen as
[56:05] verse 2 we won't go back to it on the
[56:07] screen but as newborn babes
[56:09] desire the sincere milk of the word that
[56:12] ye
[56:13] may grow that's speaking of potential of
[56:16] possibility
[56:18] amen thereby now let's just go on here
[56:21] and go into
[56:22] the book of ephesians and just look here
[56:24] verses
[56:25] 7 through 16 but unto every one of us
[56:29] is given grace according to the measure
[56:32] of the gift of god
[56:33] now if god called you to be a son or
[56:35] daughter of god
[56:36] my brother and sister he said that his
[56:39] grace is sufficient for you
[56:41] that doesn't mean that you've got a
[56:43] quota that you must live
[56:45] inside it doesn't mean that there's a
[56:47] time that
[56:48] grace will run out for you his grace
[56:52] is sufficient to take you from the
[56:54] beginning
[56:55] to the end this work i have begun in you
[56:59] i will finish hallelujah
[57:02] i'll tell you what that just gets me
[57:04] excited my brother and sister to think
[57:06] about that
[57:07] according to the measure of the gift of
[57:09] christ
[57:10] wherefore he saith when he ascended upon
[57:14] high he led captivity
[57:15] captive and gave gifts unto men now he
[57:18] that he ascended uh what is it but
[57:21] that he also descended first into the
[57:24] lower parts of the earth
[57:26] oh i tell you what my brother and sister
[57:27] i think it's a scripture we pass over
[57:29] way too easily
[57:30] way too commonly that he went to hell
[57:33] took a hold of the keys of
[57:35] death hell and the grave and possesses
[57:38] that in his hand now
[57:40] satan has no power over you
[57:43] because he doesn't even hold the key to
[57:46] his own door
[57:48] whoa think about that no man in his
[57:51] right mind in the natural is going to
[57:53] put his key to his house
[57:54] out there and give it to the neighbor
[57:56] and say now every time i need to go
[57:58] through this door here i'll come to you
[58:01] and i will
[58:02] ask for the key it just doesn't even
[58:04] make sense
[58:05] but look at this our lord jesus christ
[58:07] went down
[58:08] down down down down down into the very
[58:11] pit
[58:11] and took i can see it now he just went
[58:14] right up there and just snatched that
[58:16] key right off the belt of the devil
[58:18] and now the devil doesn't even have the
[58:21] key to
[58:22] death he doesn't have a key
[58:25] to hell and he don't have a key
[58:28] to the grave i'll tell you what you ever
[58:31] think about that my brother and sister
[58:33] the devil is completely at the mercy of
[58:36] almighty god
[58:38] oh hallelujah and i'm his wife and i
[58:40] have been given permission
[58:42] up to the half of the kingdom so it's
[58:44] time for me
[58:45] it's time for you to rise up and say you
[58:47] know what
[58:48] i have some authority here i have access
[58:51] to the keys
[58:53] oh people are saying but they're still
[58:55] passing away no they're not passing away
[58:56] they're being promoted
[58:59] see we get the wrong idea sometimes my
[59:01] brother and sister as jesus spoke about
[59:03] lazarus don't worry about
[59:04] it he's only sleeping the little girls
[59:07] only sleeping my brother and sister
[59:10] why because jesus himself held the key
[59:15] not the devil amen praise god
[59:19] well hallelujah god's got a whole lot
[59:22] more keys you know i preached on that
[59:24] one time but i i kind of got away from
[59:26] it quicker than i should have
[59:27] i want you to understand that god's got
[59:29] the key to revelation also
[59:31] hallelujah and his here and the prophet
[59:33] of god said you should pray for
[59:35] revelation first and foremost
[59:36] what does it do come seek the key don't
[59:39] just say the door of revelation is
[59:41] closed i don't understand my bible i
[59:43] read the words but i don't understand it
[59:45] i guess i'll never understand it no get
[59:46] down get serious get the key
[59:49] hallelujah and when you get the key the
[59:51] bible will become a whole new book
[59:53] amen
[59:57] he the descendant is the same also that
[59:59] ascended up far above all heavens
[1:00:02] that he might fill all things yes
[1:00:06] now i don't want to confound you with
[1:00:08] this scripture but this leaped out at me
[1:00:10] this morning i never quite
[1:00:11] read it this way before and he gave
[1:00:15] some comma
[1:00:23] hope i don't ruffle any feathers this
[1:00:26] morning
[1:00:29] he gave some apostles that's all they
[1:00:30] want
[1:00:33] they want an apostle come in they want a
[1:00:35] apostle to run their church
[1:00:38] they put all this value the apostle the
[1:00:39] apostle the apostle
[1:00:43] but if that's all they got you'll find
[1:00:46] my brother and sister
[1:00:48] apostles are setters in order
[1:00:50] establishers
[1:00:53] well that's good we need the body but if
[1:00:56] you want to be preached to like you're a
[1:00:58] sinner
[1:00:59] almost every service
[1:01:04] come on don't you think about it that's
[1:01:06] not the sum total of being an apostle
[1:01:08] right
[1:01:09] but they set things in order and they're
[1:01:11] going to whip you into order like a
[1:01:12] drill sergeant
[1:01:13] at boot camp and if that's how you want
[1:01:16] to live a christian life constantly
[1:01:18] being
[1:01:18] set in order but somewhere along the
[1:01:22] line my brother and sister
[1:01:23] you see we need a prophet
[1:01:26] and he gave some prophets now my brother
[1:01:29] and sister you can have a prophet
[1:01:31] and it's still not be the sum total of
[1:01:34] what you need
[1:01:35] he will reveal the word and lay it all
[1:01:38] out for you
[1:01:39] but a prophet is not going to be there
[1:01:41] now don't misunderstand me i'm just
[1:01:43] going to put it in these blunt words
[1:01:44] a prophet is not going to be there to
[1:01:47] hold your hand all the time
[1:01:53] right because you see the ministry and
[1:01:56] message of a prophet
[1:01:59] goes far beyond their natural time on
[1:02:01] earth
[1:02:04] are you with me
[1:02:07] and some the evangelist which comes back
[1:02:11] in essence i don't want you to
[1:02:12] misunderstand when i was talking about
[1:02:13] the apostles that that's all they do is
[1:02:15] just correct you
[1:02:16] but you see they set things in order
[1:02:18] they establish things
[1:02:20] and if you start off on the wrong
[1:02:21] foundation you have a hard time getting
[1:02:24] on the right foundation
[1:02:25] so apostles can be pretty blunt be
[1:02:27] pretty direct be pretty
[1:02:28] you know just uh a little bit but you
[1:02:31] know what
[1:02:31] you get to see that manifested in its
[1:02:34] fullness in an evangelist
[1:02:35] that's right i'll tell you what i've
[1:02:37] been around i've got some friends that
[1:02:38] are evangelists you know
[1:02:40] and and they are just those kind of guys
[1:02:42] that they will look out just following
[1:02:44] the leadership of the holy spirit
[1:02:45] they're not ashamed they're not
[1:02:47] embarrassed to come out you might be
[1:02:49] embarrassed when they get done
[1:02:50] i've set in services when evangelists
[1:02:52] come right out and just say the lord's
[1:02:54] revealed to me
[1:02:55] and appointed an individual and say you
[1:02:57] got a spirit on you you need to go
[1:02:59] in the morning and repent to your boss
[1:03:01] for the time and stuff you have stolen
[1:03:03] from him
[1:03:04] now nobody wants to have that preached
[1:03:05] in me you know it's on video cut the
[1:03:07] video
[1:03:08] uh you know
[1:03:11] but anointing on an evangelist why
[1:03:14] because he's going to stir you
[1:03:16] up he's going to stir you up and some
[1:03:19] they just like evangelistic services
[1:03:21] they just
[1:03:21] because they can go you know we always
[1:03:23] used to refer to it
[1:03:25] as a special meeting anointing
[1:03:28] you don't see somebody in church for
[1:03:30] three months straight and then there's
[1:03:32] special meetings
[1:03:33] and they're on the front row hallelujah
[1:03:37] special meeting anointing
[1:03:42] have i stepped on anybody's toes yet
[1:03:44] okay good
[1:03:45] i'm glad and some
[1:03:50] he gives pastors and teachers what is
[1:03:54] this
[1:03:54] laying of the foundation settling
[1:03:58] it all down now the way the word
[1:04:01] is written here saints i'm not here to
[1:04:03] promote the preachers
[1:04:04] so don't misunderstand me for why i'm
[1:04:06] bringing this out
[1:04:08] but you see some
[1:04:12] i i'll just reference myself so i don't
[1:04:14] have to embarrass anybody
[1:04:15] he gave some apostles i've got apostles
[1:04:18] and he gave some prophets i've got a
[1:04:20] prophet
[1:04:21] and he gave some evangelists i love
[1:04:22] evangelists well they've had a huge
[1:04:24] impact on my life
[1:04:25] and he gave some pastors and teachers
[1:04:28] you see
[1:04:29] some are going to get it all
[1:04:33] some get to choose what they want and
[1:04:35] they won't take no more but some are
[1:04:37] going to accept it all they're going to
[1:04:38] take
[1:04:39] all of the office and all of the things
[1:04:41] and the scripture
[1:04:42] says that this is for the perfecting of
[1:04:44] the saints for the work of the ministry
[1:04:46] for the edifying of the body of christ
[1:04:48] and here again i'm just going to throw
[1:04:50] this in i don't mean no offense it's
[1:04:51] just
[1:04:51] laid on my heart when i was studying my
[1:04:53] brothers and sisters
[1:04:54] some people don't really want that and
[1:04:57] according to the word of god
[1:04:59] i see where god put it in scripture but
[1:05:01] i never i haven't been able to find yet
[1:05:03] where he took it out so so he's not
[1:05:07] removed these offices
[1:05:09] from the perfecting of the saints some
[1:05:12] people got their idea my brother and
[1:05:13] sister
[1:05:14] now look this is be a little cutting but
[1:05:16] forgive me for it but my brother and
[1:05:18] sister
[1:05:18] a man who says he's a pastor who does
[1:05:21] not rightly divide the word of god
[1:05:23] he does not labor for the sheep he is
[1:05:26] not praying lord is this the right word
[1:05:28] if his deepest concern is choosing the
[1:05:31] title of the tape
[1:05:33] he's going to play then i will argue
[1:05:35] whether he is really called to be a
[1:05:37] pastor or not
[1:05:38] my brother and sister because choosing a
[1:05:40] title is not the same as laying down in
[1:05:43] the sheep code
[1:05:44] and laboring on behalf of the saints
[1:05:49] now here again that might sound like i'm
[1:05:51] pitching this for the preachers but i
[1:05:52] am not i am one of the harshest critics
[1:05:55] you will meet
[1:05:56] of preachers because my brother and
[1:05:58] sister they have a choice
[1:06:00] between being genuine or being a
[1:06:02] hireling
[1:06:04] they have a choice to labor for the
[1:06:06] sheep or to take the easiest way
[1:06:08] possible
[1:06:12] hopefully i haven't offended anyone i
[1:06:14] didn't mean it for that
[1:06:16] but you see till we come into the unity
[1:06:18] of the faith which is the word of god
[1:06:20] there's the only unity there is in the
[1:06:22] word
[1:06:22] and of the knowledge of the son of god
[1:06:24] into a perfect man into the measure of
[1:06:26] the stature
[1:06:27] of the fullness of christ
[1:06:31] now we henceforth be no more children
[1:06:34] okay so what is what is happening here
[1:06:36] is telling us
[1:06:38] here as we come into the measure of the
[1:06:41] stature of the fullness of christ
[1:06:43] that is reflecting to us growth we're
[1:06:46] coming into this we're rising up into
[1:06:49] this position
[1:06:50] of the stature in other words we weren't
[1:06:53] always in that
[1:06:55] but we're coming up into it we're
[1:06:57] growing
[1:06:58] into who god called us to be
[1:07:02] oh thank you lord i want to grow
[1:07:04] hallelujah
[1:07:06] but look at this now that we henceforth
[1:07:08] be no more children
[1:07:10] what is he telling you you know i
[1:07:12] thought this might be funny
[1:07:14] except for i know i couldn't probably
[1:07:15] pull it off without messing it up
[1:07:17] but you know what i wanted to come out
[1:07:18] this morning and i wanted to look at you
[1:07:20] and say you know what saints grow up
[1:07:25] into the stature of a perfect man
[1:07:29] it's time for us to grow we cannot stay
[1:07:32] stunted
[1:07:33] i've used this example through the years
[1:07:35] my brother and sister if your child
[1:07:37] is little it just pops in my mind just
[1:07:39] because it is this
[1:07:41] what but uh our little brother samuel
[1:07:43] he's like a hundred and
[1:07:45] two three four five or whatever
[1:07:47] percentage of growth for his age right
[1:07:49] he's he's i hope he grows up into that
[1:07:52] the lord tarries i hope he grows up into
[1:07:54] that brother sergey
[1:07:54] i hope you have to stop someday in your
[1:07:56] life and say son
[1:08:01] hallelujah but mostly i hope it comes
[1:08:03] spiritually
[1:08:05] i hope that brother sergey would come at
[1:08:07] a time in his life he could look at his
[1:08:08] son and say look at what my
[1:08:10] son's grown into a man of god
[1:08:13] and that's what i wish and desire for
[1:08:14] each and every one of our children
[1:08:16] each one of us we can grow up into this
[1:08:18] maturity in the word of god
[1:08:21] that you look at and say now here is a
[1:08:23] mature person
[1:08:24] here is a person that is as we'll go in
[1:08:26] the scripture not thrown around by
[1:08:28] any wind of doctrine by every wind of
[1:08:30] doctrine by
[1:08:31] some wind of doctrine that it be that
[1:08:33] this strong and
[1:08:34] and it will be there henceforth tossed
[1:08:37] to and fro
[1:08:38] carried about with every wind of
[1:08:40] doctrine by the slight of men
[1:08:42] and cunning craftness whereby they lay
[1:08:44] in wait to deceive
[1:08:46] you see my brother and sister the ones
[1:08:48] oh i know this is going to be a harsh
[1:08:50] statement i hope you all forgive me i
[1:08:51] prayed about this and i just
[1:08:53] but my brother and sister you see the
[1:08:55] ones that will be deceived
[1:08:58] will be immature
[1:09:03] they will be as children
[1:09:06] spirits
[1:09:10] i'm telling you my brother and sister
[1:09:11] that when a church comes into maturity
[1:09:13] meaning this body of believers in
[1:09:15] particular
[1:09:16] when you come into maturity it won't
[1:09:18] matter what kind of man
[1:09:20] comes behind a pulpit and says something
[1:09:22] contrary to the word of god
[1:09:24] you're not going to just fall over
[1:09:25] yourself to accept that because you
[1:09:27] become mature in the word
[1:09:29] and you would look at that and say i'm
[1:09:30] sorry that doesn't line up with the word
[1:09:32] of god
[1:09:32] i just thought watched you strick put
[1:09:35] strychnine in our meal
[1:09:36] and you're trying to feed it to a sorry
[1:09:38] i don't accept that i'm not going to do
[1:09:40] it just because you have reverend in
[1:09:42] front of your name or pastor in front of
[1:09:43] your name
[1:09:44] or evangelist in front of your name if
[1:09:46] you have done something to hurt the body
[1:09:48] of believers
[1:09:49] we're going to stonewall you
[1:09:56] reminds me a little story a brother
[1:09:57] shared with me one time
[1:09:59] he said they were in some meetings and a
[1:10:01] minister which went on to go into some
[1:10:04] almost heresy made some statements and
[1:10:07] some brother there
[1:10:08] you know he'd been saying amen to the
[1:10:09] word and there was a
[1:10:11] what you would call a pregnant pause and
[1:10:13] and then the brother goes amen
[1:10:15] and afterwards this brother comes up to
[1:10:16] him and says why did you say amen to
[1:10:18] that
[1:10:19] he goes well it was either that or
[1:10:21] that's a lie
[1:10:24] and he said i thought that would be
[1:10:26] inappropriate
[1:10:28] but you realize it wouldn't have been
[1:10:33] because that's what everyone was
[1:10:34] thinking
[1:10:38] maybe i shouldn't have said that
[1:10:41] but you see my brother and sister comes
[1:10:44] down
[1:10:45] speaking the truth in love may grow up
[1:10:48] into him in all things
[1:10:53] you realize in all things means our
[1:10:55] children
[1:10:56] growing up in him it means our elders
[1:10:58] you know we we sometimes like well this
[1:11:00] is brother so and so
[1:11:02] he's been a christian for 50 years it
[1:11:04] doesn't mean he's mature as a 20 year
[1:11:06] old
[1:11:08] but we give deference well they've been
[1:11:09] around forever you know and
[1:11:11] they were with this person and with that
[1:11:13] person and no i don't mean a thing
[1:11:15] they don't mean a thing see they've got
[1:11:17] to allow they've got to grow up
[1:11:19] into him in all things which is the head
[1:11:21] even christ
[1:11:22] from whom the whole body fitly joined
[1:11:24] together and compacted by that which in
[1:11:27] every joint supplyeth
[1:11:28] according to the effectual working and
[1:11:30] the measure of every part
[1:11:32] making increase of the body into the
[1:11:34] edifying of itself in love
[1:11:37] you know and i always whenever i read
[1:11:38] this scripture my brother and sister it
[1:11:40] always reminds me
[1:11:42] that we have to come to a place that we
[1:11:44] can speak the truth
[1:11:46] in love very very important
[1:11:49] speaking the truth in love now you look
[1:11:52] at this
[1:11:52] um these creatures called humans
[1:11:55] you know that's what the scripture calls
[1:11:57] you you're just a creature
[1:12:01] yes maybe wearing a few hundred dollars
[1:12:05] worth of clothes
[1:12:09] maybe all dolled up you arrived here in
[1:12:10] a really nice
[1:12:12] chariot and you have the creature
[1:12:16] comforts
[1:12:17] you wondered where that term come from
[1:12:21] creature comforts because even the world
[1:12:23] acknowledges we're just creatures
[1:12:34] this is totally inappropriate but if it
[1:12:36] was different it could be bear america
[1:12:42] some of you will understand what i'm
[1:12:43] talking about
[1:12:45] yeah see these creatures called humans
[1:12:49] have a tendency to become stymied
[1:12:54] now i want to ask you how many of you
[1:12:55] have ever thought about changing jobs
[1:12:58] but your list of why you couldn't
[1:13:01] was greater than why you could
[1:13:05] what have you done you've stymied
[1:13:08] yourself
[1:13:09] but what if i changed jobs and i didn't
[1:13:12] like it
[1:13:15] well then change jobs again
[1:13:18] all but then everybody in the church
[1:13:20] including the pastor would say you're
[1:13:21] unstable
[1:13:24] are you unstable or stymied
[1:13:29] you see when you become stymied
[1:13:33] you are afraid to take a step
[1:13:37] for the fear of the consequence
[1:13:44] you know that's why some people are in
[1:13:45] church
[1:13:47] that's right because they're afraid
[1:13:51] of the consequences of leaving
[1:13:56] if i leave maybe you know maybe
[1:13:59] something bad would happen
[1:14:03] won't be any worse than what would
[1:14:05] happen to you sitting here wishing you
[1:14:07] were left
[1:14:11] and i've heard so many times come on i
[1:14:12] hope you're in good humor this morning
[1:14:14] don't don't get depressed on me
[1:14:16] i've heard so many times oh brother
[1:14:20] i felt like in the middle of the service
[1:14:22] jumping up and shouting hallelujah
[1:14:24] why didn't you
[1:14:28] well i was kind of afraid what people
[1:14:30] would think
[1:14:32] huh that thinking thing
[1:14:35] stymied you hmm
[1:14:42] oh my
[1:14:45] [Laughter]
[1:14:48] if it's in order and it's led of the
[1:14:49] holy spirit it will be correct
[1:14:54] if it is just your human side your
[1:14:57] creature side
[1:14:59] god will set that in order amen
[1:15:02] so we have a tendency to become stymied
[1:15:05] because we
[1:15:06] we we feel like i could do this i i
[1:15:08] could do
[1:15:09] i had a friend many years ago let me
[1:15:10] just throw this in here i had a friend
[1:15:12] many years ago
[1:15:13] and i won't go into details of what the
[1:15:15] deal was but one day he had this uh this
[1:15:17] paper
[1:15:18] uh scratched on and all this thing and
[1:15:20] whatnot and he said paul i just like
[1:15:22] woke up in the middle of the night and i
[1:15:24] thought oh look at this this had worked
[1:15:25] so good and he had it drawn out
[1:15:26] almost like dimensional there you know
[1:15:28] and he goes how to do that and i said
[1:15:30] you ought to do that i said what i would
[1:15:31] do if i was you
[1:15:32] i wouldn't even go to work today we were
[1:15:33] doing construction work i wouldn't even
[1:15:35] go to work today
[1:15:36] and i would go find it you know uh some
[1:15:38] uh
[1:15:39] uh something like you know some plastic
[1:15:41] thin plastic some balsa wood
[1:15:43] and i would make me a mock-up of what
[1:15:45] you're thinking about here
[1:15:46] because i i think you're on to something
[1:15:48] and he was like yeah yeah yeah
[1:15:50] and he goes to work and he talks about
[1:15:52] it all day every day i got to hear it
[1:15:54] five and six days a week about this
[1:15:56] thing
[1:15:56] and then one day comes and man he's got
[1:15:58] the longest face you've ever seen this
[1:16:00] is probably eight ten months later
[1:16:02] longest face you've ever seen and he
[1:16:04] holds a magazine
[1:16:06] up and there it is
[1:16:10] and the man who designed it went on this
[1:16:12] is irrelevant but
[1:16:13] a key ingredient me a multi-millionaire
[1:16:19] why didn't he pursue it
[1:16:22] what stymied him
[1:16:26] doubts of whether it would be accepted
[1:16:28] doubts whether it was feasible doubts of
[1:16:30] this
[1:16:30] doubts of that remember the quote we
[1:16:33] just read to you the other day
[1:16:35] my brother and sister you got to dig
[1:16:37] down you got to throw the tin cans and
[1:16:40] the pots and the pans and the doubts and
[1:16:42] the fears out
[1:16:43] till you get all the way down to jesus
[1:16:45] christ
[1:16:47] you can't let any of that because my
[1:16:48] brother and sister the devil will put
[1:16:50] something in your life
[1:16:52] to stymie you stepping out on the word
[1:16:55] and saying you know what i'm going to
[1:16:56] act on this
[1:16:57] the word says i'm going to act on this
[1:16:59] the devil come and says but you know
[1:17:01] uh you know just it was just only a few
[1:17:03] months ago you told a lie so
[1:17:05] you couldn't possibly rejoice in god now
[1:17:07] you couldn't possibly claim victory now
[1:17:09] because because you did this or you did
[1:17:11] that or you come from a certain
[1:17:12] background
[1:17:13] my brother and sister it's there that
[1:17:15] satan is going to always throw something
[1:17:17] out there to stymie you
[1:17:21] you can either resign yourself to be
[1:17:23] stymied
[1:17:25] which depending on which dictionary you
[1:17:27] look in basically
[1:17:29] you can just say that the word stymie is
[1:17:32] to be
[1:17:32] hindered
[1:17:40] and as we said before maybe the devil
[1:17:42] might be out on the step crying because
[1:17:45] you're blaming him for the lack
[1:17:49] of something in your life when it really
[1:17:52] isn't him in charge at all
[1:17:57] he has no keys he has no keys saints
[1:18:01] come on hear me well this morning
[1:18:03] he has no keys to lock you
[1:18:06] in or lock you out
[1:18:12] you're the wife of the king which means
[1:18:13] you have keys to everything
[1:18:20] certain tendencies we have and i don't
[1:18:23] mean to use
[1:18:24] large words but this is the word that
[1:18:25] came to me so i put it in here
[1:18:27] we have a proclivity a tendency to go in
[1:18:30] a certain direction
[1:18:33] well you know i i've just never been a a
[1:18:36] real
[1:18:36] real spiritual person
[1:18:40] like brother so and so our sister
[1:18:42] so-and-so well i'm going to ask you
[1:18:44] why you'll be just as spiritual
[1:18:49] as you choose to be
[1:18:54] but it's never ran in our family i mean
[1:18:56] all the way back to my great grandfather
[1:18:58] and grandma you know they
[1:18:59] they never and my grandma and grandpa
[1:19:01] they never and mom and dad they never
[1:19:04] and so that's that's why i'm not oh so
[1:19:07] you have a
[1:19:08] tendency to just follow the family
[1:19:14] well maybe we all know what lemmings are
[1:19:16] don't we
[1:19:17] how many cartoons are there about
[1:19:19] lemmings
[1:19:21] one of them stops at the edge of the
[1:19:22] cliff looking down the ocean says to
[1:19:24] another why are we doing this
[1:19:26] i don't know but everyone else is doing
[1:19:28] it come on
[1:19:31] and they leap off okay that might be
[1:19:34] your tendency
[1:19:36] you think you think
[1:19:40] that you're a follower
[1:19:44] oh come on i'm gonna get rough on you
[1:19:45] now
[1:19:47] i don't like to hear this we're
[1:19:49] followers of the message
[1:19:51] no i'm sorry i'm not a follower of the
[1:19:52] message i am the message
[1:19:55] i am the gospel of jesus christ i
[1:19:58] am the bride of jesus christ i'm not a
[1:20:01] follower of this
[1:20:04] reminds me of a deal i come across a
[1:20:06] while back i don't really do the social
[1:20:07] media thing but every once in a while i
[1:20:09] spy on you i mean i look at people's
[1:20:10] stuff
[1:20:14] and that this guy had thousands upon
[1:20:16] tens of thousands
[1:20:18] of likes to some deal that he put and i
[1:20:20] thought well that might be interesting
[1:20:22] and i clicked on it and i thought this
[1:20:24] is the stupidest thing i have ever seen
[1:20:26] in my life oh i'm not allowed to use
[1:20:27] that term i'm sorry
[1:20:28] children it was the most ridiculously
[1:20:33] unedifying uneducational and
[1:20:36] empty
[1:20:40] and he had like 175 000 people who had
[1:20:43] liked it
[1:20:48] i think i'll follow him 175 000 people
[1:20:51] can't be wrong can they
[1:20:54] no they can be
[1:20:58] ah anyway forgive me
[1:21:02] very wrong thank you sister kerry yes
[1:21:05] i was thinking more on the intellectual
[1:21:07] level but uh
[1:21:10] now look a tendency to go in a certain
[1:21:13] direction
[1:21:14] come on let's just be real this morning
[1:21:16] maybe you have a tendency to get caught
[1:21:17] up in the things of life and
[1:21:19] and and you know you have a real problem
[1:21:21] with things and and you have a tendency
[1:21:23] to get in a certain vein and
[1:21:24] and people say well i'm just so tired
[1:21:27] i'm sorry that's why i'm angry
[1:21:31] i'm hungry that's why i'm angry i'll use
[1:21:34] that one because it's one that has been
[1:21:35] coined on me you're angry
[1:21:39] no i'm actually just angry i'm not
[1:21:42] hungry at all really i mean i could eat
[1:21:44] but
[1:21:44] i'm just angry let's not make an excuse
[1:21:47] out of it i'm blaming the sandwich i
[1:21:48] never ate
[1:21:50] on my mental condition
[1:21:54] come on i want you to think about this
[1:21:55] to go beyond the humor and think about
[1:21:57] the reality of it i'm gonna blame
[1:21:59] you know what this is not my fault my
[1:22:02] husband looked at me like
[1:22:04] yeah and so therefore i will act like
[1:22:07] and so it's his fault
[1:22:11] wow i'd like to have a little
[1:22:14] joystick to your expressions
[1:22:23] no you're in control of you
[1:22:27] the devil's not in control of you he has
[1:22:29] no keys and if the devil don't have a
[1:22:31] key you can't go blame it on someone
[1:22:33] else that they've got the key
[1:22:35] to your situation god's got the key to
[1:22:38] your situation
[1:22:39] trust god and act upon his word and
[1:22:42] have faith in god oh no don't worry
[1:22:46] about his saints no
[1:22:47] none of you get offended this morning
[1:22:48] i'm preaching to me
[1:22:50] and so far it's hurting
[1:22:54] because you see my brother and sister
[1:22:57] because we have a tendency to go in a
[1:22:59] certain direction
[1:23:08] i'll throw myself under the bus i worked
[1:23:11] with brother adam
[1:23:12] several years one day he looked at me
[1:23:15] and he goes
[1:23:16] my goodness paul you are the moodiest
[1:23:20] person i have ever met in my life
[1:23:26] same to you buddy
[1:23:29] because probably the reason i'm in this
[1:23:31] mood is you
[1:23:33] no no the reason i was in that mood was
[1:23:36] me
[1:23:44] i think that was also at the same time
[1:23:45] that brother adam said i think i should
[1:23:47] just hit you in the head with a hammer
[1:23:48] and get it over with
[1:23:54] but you see i don't move on to greater
[1:23:56] things
[1:23:58] because go ahead fill in the blank
[1:24:02] go ahead come on saints i want to ask
[1:24:06] you
[1:24:06] why you're not moving in heavenly places
[1:24:08] fill in the blank
[1:24:10] i'm not moving in there because
[1:24:17] we can arrange that and i'm not sliding
[1:24:19] this don't misunderstand me
[1:24:21] but we can arrange that answer
[1:24:24] from something everywhere from our
[1:24:26] childhood to our boss
[1:24:29] from our financial condition to
[1:24:32] lord this woman thou hast given me
[1:24:37] i want the real answer why aren't you in
[1:24:40] heavenly places
[1:24:42] why aren't you moving in the direction
[1:24:43] that the word of god called you in
[1:24:46] why aren't you rising up amen husbands
[1:24:48] why aren't you making your wife a queen
[1:24:50] wives why aren't you making your husband
[1:24:53] a king
[1:24:54] why well i have go ahead fill in the
[1:24:58] blank
[1:25:02] but the scripture says that our natural
[1:25:05] relationship
[1:25:07] is a reflection of a spiritual
[1:25:11] relationship
[1:25:14] ouch can i say it for you saints
[1:25:17] ouch wives will you say it with me
[1:25:21] ouch husbands come on say it with me
[1:25:24] ouch
[1:25:28] but no sir even started with adam oh no
[1:25:31] lord
[1:25:31] this whole circumstance is not my fault
[1:25:35] it is the woman you gave me
[1:25:41] lord had no idea she was so wiry she was
[1:25:43] so strong and she held me down and
[1:25:45] shoved that apple in my mouth
[1:25:54] come on are you with me
[1:26:02] i'm not going to move on i can't move on
[1:26:04] because
[1:26:06] of see what happens my brother and
[1:26:09] sister when you
[1:26:10] fill something in that blank other than
[1:26:12] recognizing you yourself or hindering
[1:26:15] your spiritual walk
[1:26:17] you will never do the greater work
[1:26:20] now who wants to do the greater work i
[1:26:22] hope this morning that i'm not coming
[1:26:24] across too straight to you
[1:26:25] i mean i want to come across straight to
[1:26:27] you but i hope it's not offensive
[1:26:29] amen who wants to do the greater work
[1:26:32] amen i believe every one of us here
[1:26:34] ought to be saying lord i want to do the
[1:26:35] greater work
[1:26:36] i want to be the overcomer i want to be
[1:26:38] filled with the holy ghost i want to be
[1:26:39] the example of what a daughter of god
[1:26:41] should be like
[1:26:42] i want to be an example of what a son of
[1:26:43] god should be like that's what i desire
[1:26:46] to do
[1:26:46] so my brother and sister are never going
[1:26:48] to move into the greater work
[1:26:50] if we're putting the wrong thing in the
[1:26:53] blank
[1:26:58] now i want to ask you where's your life
[1:27:01] going to go if satan's giving you advice
[1:27:05] you know there's that guy on the radio
[1:27:08] dave ramsey some people don't like him
[1:27:10] they don't like the way he speaks they
[1:27:11] don't like the way he thinks
[1:27:12] sister jerry and i don't follow his
[1:27:14] stuff 100 percent
[1:27:15] but i tell you what he was the guy that
[1:27:17] let me know years ago how i was feeling
[1:27:19] is because i was sick and tired of being
[1:27:21] sick and tired of being sick and tired
[1:27:23] of being broke
[1:27:26] so he started to implement his plan and
[1:27:28] what worked for us you might say
[1:27:30] but we did it one thing we did take from
[1:27:32] him was discipline
[1:27:34] and that was if we didn't have the money
[1:27:35] we didn't spend it so that cute little
[1:27:37] piece of plastic didn't become our
[1:27:38] banker
[1:27:40] amen now you look at that my brother and
[1:27:43] sister and realize
[1:27:44] that if satan is giving you advice
[1:27:48] dave ramsey says never take advice
[1:27:52] from a broke man
[1:27:59] now if you'll loan me a hundred dollars
[1:28:01] i'll show you church how to invest that
[1:28:05] no sir i hope you're i hope you're
[1:28:07] smarter than that
[1:28:08] don't take advice from a broke man
[1:28:17] oh my oh my
[1:28:21] can i just give you this startling
[1:28:24] startling revelation
[1:28:27] i mean it is very startling
[1:28:30] don't take advice from the devil
[1:28:38] oh you look pretty in that
[1:28:42] half a dress oh
[1:28:45] you look so masculine strutting around
[1:28:49] like that you look so
[1:28:53] fill in the blank i'm sorry
[1:28:57] i've already got i'm not preaching dress
[1:28:59] code here but
[1:29:00] i've already got god's advice on what i
[1:29:03] should look like
[1:29:05] we have god's advice on what we should
[1:29:08] look like
[1:29:09] how we should present ourselves
[1:29:14] some people i've heard it preached
[1:29:15] before well the word of god talks about
[1:29:18] wives with a meek and contrite spirit
[1:29:20] yeah bride of christ
[1:29:25] no no i'm talking about my earthly bride
[1:29:27] i mean i want her to like heal
[1:29:36] well how come when the lord spoke to you
[1:29:38] last time and
[1:29:39] asked you you refused
[1:29:44] but you want your wife and your children
[1:29:46] to line right up
[1:29:48] to what what are we lining up to
[1:29:52] say amen paul amen
[1:29:57] so is satan offering the advice or is
[1:29:59] god
[1:30:00] look my brother and sister there's so
[1:30:02] many scriptures we couldn't touch on it
[1:30:03] this morning
[1:30:04] speaking of the foundation of growth or
[1:30:06] foundation for growth through the
[1:30:08] scripture
[1:30:08] amen it's all over it's there everywhere
[1:30:11] just speaking for us all these things uh
[1:30:14] i could have brought you up many many
[1:30:16] many scriptures that either directly
[1:30:17] touch it or
[1:30:18] in reference to it now you look at this
[1:30:21] my brother and sister brother brahms
[1:30:22] speaking in the church age book
[1:30:24] and it's there he's talking about how
[1:30:25] the real tendency we have
[1:30:27] is a tendency to decline now have you
[1:30:30] ever noticed
[1:30:30] amen i don't speak nothing i'll just go
[1:30:33] ahead and name their names so i they
[1:30:34] won't feel embarrassed
[1:30:35] but um you know the minute that uh sean
[1:30:38] and uh
[1:30:39] uh gideon quit doing all them push-ups
[1:30:44] and sit-ups and chin-ups they're gonna
[1:30:47] look just like me
[1:30:54] and when they're my age they will look
[1:30:57] just like me
[1:31:00] i'm sorry to disappoint you brothers
[1:31:04] but i applaud them they're young you
[1:31:07] know
[1:31:09] sorry brothers but if you've ever been
[1:31:12] around peacocks
[1:31:24] it's your season it's your season go for
[1:31:28] it
[1:31:33] sorry i just couldn't help myself
[1:31:37] but you see there's a tendency to
[1:31:39] decline and
[1:31:40] we'll see when it comes to the spiritual
[1:31:42] my brother and sister
[1:31:43] i want you to give me a yes or no on
[1:31:45] this do we remain
[1:31:47] spiritual by just going to church
[1:31:51] no we go to church and we do all of
[1:31:54] these things because it's part of the
[1:31:56] regimen
[1:31:57] sorry brothers i included you that way
[1:31:59] it wasn't fair but i just
[1:32:01] love you so much i only threw you under
[1:32:04] the bus once
[1:32:08] the spiritual regimen the word of god's
[1:32:12] given
[1:32:12] the answer of the spiritual resume how
[1:32:14] we stay strong
[1:32:16] we don't do it by just going to church
[1:32:18] and saying god is real the devil says
[1:32:19] god is real
[1:32:21] the devil believes the bible he
[1:32:24] understands it
[1:32:25] better than we do but it won't make him
[1:32:28] spiritual
[1:32:30] amen so you see we have to come to a
[1:32:33] place
[1:32:33] and we have to fight against this
[1:32:35] tendency to decline in this spirit
[1:32:37] and brother branham says here just this
[1:32:38] yeah you know
[1:32:40] this looks very cherry picked and it is
[1:32:44] you go read before it you go read after
[1:32:46] it i saw this beautiful cherry on the
[1:32:47] tree i picked it
[1:32:49] what does the messenger church message
[1:32:51] the church teach us then teach us
[1:32:53] teach us not the growth in the spirit no
[1:32:56] sir it's decline of the spirit we have a
[1:32:58] decline
[1:32:59] all the time i cherry picked this out
[1:33:01] you go study it you have access to it
[1:33:04] you see what it is though is the nature
[1:33:06] if we don't go and some people say i can
[1:33:07] be spiritual without going to church
[1:33:09] that's good
[1:33:09] but my bible tells me not to forsake the
[1:33:12] assembling of myself together
[1:33:13] because the bible's acknowledging that
[1:33:15] is part of the ingredient
[1:33:17] of your spiritual state
[1:33:22] read your bible pray pray for others
[1:33:27] these are all part of the ingredient of
[1:33:30] what gives us a strong
[1:33:31] spiritual standing gives us the
[1:33:34] endurance to stand in the day
[1:33:36] that we are my brother and sister so
[1:33:38] it's there what this will do
[1:33:40] is a constant diet now part of the
[1:33:42] reason i brought sean
[1:33:43] and gideon into this conversation is as
[1:33:46] young men they themselves know
[1:33:48] that if they were doing you know a
[1:33:49] hundred push-ups and then they go on
[1:33:52] vacation or do whatever and they don't
[1:33:53] have opportunity to do that very next
[1:33:55] time
[1:33:56] they get on the floor a hundred push-ups
[1:33:58] is agony
[1:34:00] just in that is that not right brothers
[1:34:02] in just that little short time and
[1:34:04] and look as long as we serve god first
[1:34:07] seek ye first the kingdom of god
[1:34:08] exercise the scripture says does no good
[1:34:11] it's not but but my brother sister it's
[1:34:14] talking about when the spirit of the age
[1:34:16] comes
[1:34:17] we got these spiritually mentally
[1:34:19] morally defunct people
[1:34:21] that are very strong very fit
[1:34:24] very well there's nothing wrong with
[1:34:26] what they're doing at least i'm not
[1:34:28] gonna
[1:34:28] i'm not gonna speak against that's
[1:34:30] between them their parents and them
[1:34:33] but they know 100 push-ups
[1:34:37] two weeks later i'd get back on this
[1:34:41] 61. 62.
[1:34:47] ah that's good for today
[1:34:51] apply it to the spirit
[1:34:55] there was a while i know you guys won't
[1:34:57] believe this but there was a while
[1:34:58] brother paul was doing between 50 and 75
[1:35:00] push-ups a day
[1:35:01] and i was doing some other things
[1:35:03] exercising
[1:35:05] then i got sidetracked
[1:35:08] i see that was uh wasn't 20 20.
[1:35:13] it wasn't in 2019
[1:35:17] wasn't 18
[1:35:20] might have been in 2017 but i'm going to
[1:35:22] get right after it
[1:35:27] you see what happens the mind they say
[1:35:30] is willing but the body is weak no i'd
[1:35:34] say the body is weak because the mind is
[1:35:36] not willing
[1:35:39] spiritual position for growth
[1:35:43] you have to decide i'm going to grow
[1:35:46] into what god called me to be
[1:35:51] come on that's right this is not not the
[1:35:53] most exciting
[1:35:54] the rate i'm going it might be one of
[1:35:56] the longest ones though
[1:35:57] so so it's a tendency now look
[1:36:01] i want you to understand the principles
[1:36:02] of growth it takes good soil
[1:36:04] we have the parable in the bible right
[1:36:08] planted by the roadside amongst the
[1:36:10] rocks
[1:36:11] good soil weeds briars etc right that
[1:36:13] parable
[1:36:14] we have a water amen necessary for
[1:36:18] growth and the scripture tells us that
[1:36:20] we must be washed by the water of the
[1:36:22] word
[1:36:23] so the presence of the word of god in
[1:36:26] our life
[1:36:26] the effect of the word in our life
[1:36:29] washes us
[1:36:31] you don't have to ask it to wash you you
[1:36:33] get in the word
[1:36:34] you get in the presence of god it will
[1:36:37] wash you too many people then they get
[1:36:40] distracted they go to church and they
[1:36:42] plan their future they plan this they
[1:36:43] plan that
[1:36:44] uh you know church is a good place i
[1:36:46] fixed a lot of things in church
[1:36:50] oh yeah i know you think i'm joking i'm
[1:36:52] dead serious
[1:36:53] why because my mind
[1:36:56] was somewhere else and i did not
[1:37:01] let me just put it this way you said
[1:37:03] here
[1:37:04] with your mind out there
[1:37:07] you will not be washed
[1:37:11] you will not change in the slightest
[1:37:18] you have to be here in body mind
[1:37:22] and spirit then the water of the word
[1:37:26] starts to wash you
[1:37:27] and we find ourselves being changed and
[1:37:30] then the last
[1:37:31] ingredient that is absolutely necessary
[1:37:34] for growth is sunlight
[1:37:38] and when you have the sun in your life
[1:37:40] my brother and sister your life changes
[1:37:42] it absolutely changes now look
[1:37:46] this might sound funny i i want to
[1:37:48] explain this in such a way that you'll
[1:37:49] understand
[1:37:50] now this is based upon ornamental plants
[1:37:54] okay but if you've ever been to a pot
[1:37:56] farm
[1:37:58] no no not that kind of pot ornamental
[1:38:01] plants
[1:38:02] they call them pot farms because
[1:38:04] everything there is raised above ground
[1:38:07] in a pot it starts in the greenhouse go
[1:38:10] over in the state of oregon
[1:38:11] the willamette valley there is hundreds
[1:38:13] and hundreds of these kind of farms yeah
[1:38:15] all these stores over here
[1:38:16] you're buying geraniums and this that
[1:38:18] and tulips and all these things right
[1:38:19] here they come out of a pot farm
[1:38:22] and they start off in a greenhouse with
[1:38:24] these little dinky pots
[1:38:25] and little dinky cups and a seed in it
[1:38:27] and it sprouts
[1:38:28] and it goes for so many days they've
[1:38:30] done this research where they it's very
[1:38:32] predictive
[1:38:33] it grows for so many days they pop it
[1:38:35] out of that they don't throw that little
[1:38:36] pot away they reuse it but they pop that
[1:38:38] out of there
[1:38:39] and they literally go and they move it
[1:38:40] right over here and transplant it into a
[1:38:42] bigger pot
[1:38:44] and then it goes for so many days and
[1:38:46] they transplant it
[1:38:47] to a bigger pot and so many days they
[1:38:49] transplant it to a bigger pot
[1:38:52] now what happens my brother and sister
[1:38:53] if they skip that process
[1:38:56] that little plant has now it has soil
[1:38:59] it has water it has sunlight it's going
[1:39:02] to grow
[1:39:03] but if it's not moved to another pot
[1:39:07] it will become root bound and i tell you
[1:39:11] our churches are full of root bound
[1:39:13] people
[1:39:14] because they didn't want anyone to come
[1:39:16] out oh pardon me saints they didn't want
[1:39:18] no one coming out disturbing don't you
[1:39:21] preacher
[1:39:22] disturb my world don't you dare try
[1:39:26] and pluck me out of my condition that's
[1:39:28] miserable
[1:39:29] my marriage stinks my children are
[1:39:32] falling apart
[1:39:33] i hate my job but don't you dare
[1:39:35] preacher
[1:39:36] talk to me about my life why they want
[1:39:39] to stay
[1:39:40] in that same little pot and they don't
[1:39:42] realize the whole time the roots are
[1:39:44] still growing
[1:39:44] but instead of growing out now they've
[1:39:46] turned back on themselves
[1:39:49] and pretty soon the only thing that's
[1:39:51] going to cure my problems is a bottle
[1:39:53] only thing that's going to cure my
[1:39:54] problem is an extra marital effect
[1:39:56] only thing that's going to is this only
[1:39:58] thing it is going to have a new car i
[1:39:59] got to have a boat i have to
[1:40:01] i can have this gotta have that i got it
[1:40:02] why because the roots have turned back
[1:40:04] on themselves
[1:40:05] they're no longer growing out they're
[1:40:08] growing back to themselves
[1:40:10] i must do this if i do this i'll happy
[1:40:16] does anyone here know what i'm talking
[1:40:17] about
[1:40:19] if i just had this i would be happy
[1:40:22] you get it now you're just
[1:40:25] unhappy with the payment
[1:40:30] but if i had this i would be okay and
[1:40:32] now you're unhappy
[1:40:34] with another payment you see
[1:40:37] it's got to be plucked out of that it's
[1:40:40] got to be disturbed its world's got to
[1:40:42] be broke up
[1:40:43] now i happen to know people that own or
[1:40:44] run a place like this my brother and
[1:40:46] sister they don't just pull that little
[1:40:48] thing out of that little round or square
[1:40:50] hole and stuff it in some other dirt
[1:40:51] over here
[1:40:52] but to stimulate the roots to break away
[1:40:55] from its
[1:40:56] position they actually grab it and crush
[1:40:59] it
[1:41:00] and then transplant it into new soil
[1:41:03] are you with me and you wonder sometimes
[1:41:06] well the preacher he got a little too
[1:41:08] personal
[1:41:08] i don't know i don't like this i don't
[1:41:09] like him look in my world you know i
[1:41:11] don't like him talking about my
[1:41:12] condition i don't like that
[1:41:14] why my brother and sister you've got to
[1:41:15] break those root bound roots
[1:41:18] and get them to where now they've got to
[1:41:20] go and find new soil
[1:41:24] and it doesn't happen just once in your
[1:41:25] life god allows it to happen
[1:41:28] again and again and again
[1:41:32] and the ultimate of it my brother and
[1:41:34] sister is this little seed that started
[1:41:36] off in a greenhouse
[1:41:38] is now planted in a pot and you take
[1:41:40] that pot home as it were
[1:41:42] and you dig a hole and you put all the
[1:41:44] right ingredients and and peat moss
[1:41:46] and a little bit of steer manure and
[1:41:48] compost or whatever you want to call it
[1:41:49] around it and you get it seeded in there
[1:41:52] and you know it says it should the root
[1:41:53] crown should be you know three inches
[1:41:55] above the yard
[1:41:56] so that it just and so you don't just
[1:41:58] say ah they don't know what they're
[1:41:59] talking about listen
[1:42:01] listen god knows what he's talking about
[1:42:04] saints listen
[1:42:06] we can't just do this any old way i
[1:42:08] don't understand why their plant looks
[1:42:10] so good and ours doesn't
[1:42:11] you didn't listen
[1:42:16] god says i want to i want to transplant
[1:42:17] you i want to take you from your
[1:42:19] position i want to take you from your
[1:42:21] situation
[1:42:22] you're starting oh you've gotten a
[1:42:23] bigger pot god's blessed you you have
[1:42:25] some understanding you have a little
[1:42:27] revelation of the word
[1:42:28] but it's time to be moved to another pot
[1:42:30] it's time for you to be plucked up out
[1:42:32] of that one and move to another place
[1:42:33] and then there is a place my brother and
[1:42:35] sister that god says you know what
[1:42:36] this world is not my home and so there's
[1:42:39] gonna come another day right here
[1:42:41] that god is going to puck you and i
[1:42:43] right out of this place we call home
[1:42:46] and he's going to take us home
[1:42:48] hallelujah
[1:42:51] amen now look at this
[1:42:55] if it's not moved it comes to a season
[1:42:57] where it starts to decline it's stunted
[1:43:00] and will never oh saint i hope you just
[1:43:04] grasp this
[1:43:06] you take in the natural a plant and it
[1:43:08] goes so far
[1:43:10] and that it's stunted not just set back
[1:43:13] a little bit
[1:43:14] but stunting that plant will never reach
[1:43:18] its potential can you see what satan's
[1:43:20] trying to do saints
[1:43:22] satan's trying to come down he's trying
[1:43:24] to make it to where we're so
[1:43:26] so afraid almost we're so resistant to
[1:43:29] the idea
[1:43:29] of god coming down and shaking our world
[1:43:32] that we just want to hold on to what we
[1:43:34] got
[1:43:34] our little position i like it how it is
[1:43:37] i'm comfortable
[1:43:38] and god says look i'm not going to move
[1:43:40] you unless you want to be moved
[1:43:42] i'm not going to force you to serve me
[1:43:44] and i know i'm just comfortable lord i
[1:43:46] get stimulated i can say amen once in a
[1:43:48] while
[1:43:49] my family's good everything's fine but
[1:43:52] the day that plant is stunted
[1:43:56] it don't matter what condition you place
[1:43:59] it in
[1:44:00] after that it will forever
[1:44:03] be stunted do you see what satan's
[1:44:05] trying to do he's trying to bind us down
[1:44:08] he knows that you're a son of god he
[1:44:10] knows you're a daughter of god
[1:44:12] and he's doing his very best to come
[1:44:14] along and stunt you
[1:44:22] but brother paul god answers my prayer
[1:44:24] that ain't got nothing to do with it
[1:44:27] anointed ones at the end time will give
[1:44:28] you a clear vision on what it is god
[1:44:30] answering prayer
[1:44:32] god will answer prayer my brother and
[1:44:33] sister for healings for deliverance for
[1:44:35] all of this
[1:44:36] and all they have is the authority of
[1:44:38] the word they never had the experience
[1:44:40] and you say how can that be well god god
[1:44:42] will honor that
[1:44:44] amen oh let me hurry along here now
[1:44:48] this is just lovely because the title
[1:44:51] says it all now israel in egypt
[1:44:56] was not planted that's right that wasn't
[1:44:59] their home
[1:45:02] they were just set out it wasn't their
[1:45:03] original home ground
[1:45:05] and a man that's a christian that rests
[1:45:07] his eternal destination upon some
[1:45:09] denominational creed
[1:45:10] he's not in his right place he was born
[1:45:13] to be free and a child of god
[1:45:18] to worship god but he's under a creed he
[1:45:20] can't bring forth his fruit
[1:45:22] yet something in him is longing to do it
[1:45:26] he shall be like a tree that is planted
[1:45:29] by rivers
[1:45:29] of water rivers pearl water singular
[1:45:33] many rivers coming into one channel in
[1:45:35] other words he'll be like a man in the
[1:45:36] scripture
[1:45:36] that believe all of god's words where
[1:45:38] the power and nine spiritual gifts can
[1:45:40] flow
[1:45:40] through one god into his inner most
[1:45:43] being
[1:45:46] you know i'm tired of apologizing
[1:45:50] and i'm not going to be ashamed of who i
[1:45:53] go to church with
[1:45:54] that's right but i'm entitled to my
[1:45:57] opinion
[1:45:58] too
[1:46:07] people don't believe in shouting the
[1:46:10] thing it is they haven't got spiritual
[1:46:12] joy
[1:46:13] and the joys of the water of life can
[1:46:15] throw flow through
[1:46:17] that's a whole lot is the matter with
[1:46:19] the branham tabernacle
[1:46:21] because that unbelief that's it oh
[1:46:26] our prophet is so kind and so loving
[1:46:30] so encouraging unlike some of these
[1:46:34] oh this is almost a direct quote unlike
[1:46:36] some of these
[1:46:38] preachers in the message that are so
[1:46:41] harsh
[1:46:46] okay and the joys of water
[1:46:50] life can flow through that's a whole lot
[1:46:52] is the matter
[1:46:53] with branham tabernacle
[1:46:56] wow sounds kind doesn't it
[1:47:01] like a grandfather
[1:47:04] be almost like a dad saying now there's
[1:47:06] a lot of really good young men around
[1:47:07] here except for my son
[1:47:13] no he just named it right to him he's
[1:47:14] speaking direct to them
[1:47:17] do we have the courage to change that
[1:47:19] today
[1:47:20] that's a whole lot is the matter with
[1:47:22] grace tabernacle
[1:47:24] because that unbelief the cares of the
[1:47:27] world
[1:47:28] had bound the people until it cannot
[1:47:30] produce
[1:47:31] spiritual growth
[1:47:35] that's the matter with our nation that's
[1:47:36] a matter with our churches they have no
[1:47:38] joy and the joy of the lord has departed
[1:47:40] brother branham goes on go ahead do the
[1:47:42] homework on this
[1:47:43] he goes on to talk about ichabod
[1:47:46] it is very direct amen no use planting
[1:47:50] or playing around my brother and sister
[1:47:52] now look i'm going to put this this way
[1:47:54] i i've got to get over this complex i'm
[1:47:57] not going to defend myself i'm not going
[1:47:58] to do i know what my heart is i know
[1:48:00] what my desire is
[1:48:01] but my brother and sister i can assure
[1:48:02] you this having been around a couple
[1:48:04] places on the earth
[1:48:06] that some preachers don't really want
[1:48:07] you to grow because you see
[1:48:10] it takes work to prepare the soil it
[1:48:13] takes work on all parts to to get the
[1:48:16] condition
[1:48:17] to get it watered it takes work to get
[1:48:19] it in position
[1:48:20] to get the sun to shine on it and it's
[1:48:24] much easier
[1:48:24] just to go ahead and move along with a
[1:48:27] half-hearted we are believers
[1:48:29] we believe this we believe that and just
[1:48:31] let it rest
[1:48:32] but i'm here to tell you my brother and
[1:48:34] sister that we're not just wanting you
[1:48:36] to sit down and say praise the lord god
[1:48:38] gave us this and it's good
[1:48:40] your tree is growing your life is
[1:48:43] growing
[1:48:44] this word is growing and it's time for
[1:48:47] you to get off and pardon me you can
[1:48:49] fire me if you want to
[1:48:50] but it's time for you to get off of your
[1:48:53] excuse wagon
[1:48:54] it's time for you to get off your little
[1:48:56] lazy bottoms
[1:48:57] it's time for you to stand up and say i
[1:49:00] want to be
[1:49:01] what god called me to be i am no longer
[1:49:05] going to sit here and offer up an excuse
[1:49:07] i am going to get up i'm going to let
[1:49:10] the word of god
[1:49:11] motivate me and i'm gonna go stand in
[1:49:14] the sun
[1:49:15] amen and when i get in the presence of
[1:49:17] the sun i cannot help
[1:49:19] but grow have you ever done this
[1:49:23] now sometimes our houses are situated as
[1:49:25] such but my brother and sister we did it
[1:49:27] when the kids were young
[1:49:28] well we we we did a lot of little things
[1:49:31] like that
[1:49:32] you take certain flowers or very
[1:49:33] receptive to this and you go put them in
[1:49:35] this window and they'll lean this way
[1:49:38] and then you go to the other side the
[1:49:40] house and put them in a different window
[1:49:42] with them leaning into the house and you
[1:49:43] go back the next day and they lean this
[1:49:45] way
[1:49:46] you see there's some that are just so
[1:49:48] attracted to the light
[1:49:49] they cannot help themselves i've got to
[1:49:51] be in the presence of the sun
[1:49:54] amen and it's time for us to just get
[1:49:56] off of our lazy bones
[1:49:58] and get to the place that we say i'm
[1:50:00] tired of offering
[1:50:01] up excuses you're giving an offering
[1:50:06] am i preaching too hard okay because i
[1:50:09] could water it down and finish this up
[1:50:11] if you don't mind
[1:50:14] you're offering up
[1:50:18] a sacrifice
[1:50:22] it's either praise or it's an excuse
[1:50:28] but you're offering it up
[1:50:31] the same let me say that you
[1:50:35] are offering up your life
[1:50:39] you will either offer it to him amen
[1:50:43] or you will offer it
[1:50:48] i just hate to say this because it
[1:50:50] sounds so harsh
[1:50:52] you'll either offer it to him or you'll
[1:50:54] offer it to the devil
[1:50:55] that's right amen but but no i wasn't
[1:50:58] offering it to the devil i'm sorry to
[1:51:00] tell you if you're not offering it to
[1:51:01] him
[1:51:03] you're offering it to the devil
[1:51:06] there's no middle ground there's not a
[1:51:08] broker show me a scripture where there's
[1:51:10] a broker
[1:51:11] now look okay jesus um
[1:51:15] we'll we'll give you these two if you
[1:51:16] let us have these three and these three
[1:51:18] are lefties anyway so it doesn't matter
[1:51:20] and so you're coming out better because
[1:51:21] these two are good and oh because we
[1:51:23] gave you the two better ones last time
[1:51:25] now we want these here
[1:51:27] and we'll get no there's no brokers
[1:51:30] there's no brokers it's your decision
[1:51:33] i want to know what you're offering
[1:51:34] today yeah come on i watched a video
[1:51:37] here a while back
[1:51:38] hope you guys don't misunderstand this
[1:51:42] they passed an offering parade big old
[1:51:43] church about 15 minutes later after he's
[1:51:46] telling about his latest
[1:51:48] this and that and they come back
[1:51:53] now i told you all to put a hundred
[1:51:55] dollars a piece in the offering plate
[1:51:57] and we did the math and we counted you
[1:51:59] and it come up short we're passing the
[1:52:01] plate again
[1:52:11] what did you offer up this morning
[1:52:15] come on saints do i need to come and sit
[1:52:18] down on the pew with you
[1:52:20] i want to ask you this morning in all
[1:52:22] seriousness
[1:52:24] what did you offer up this morning amen
[1:52:28] did you come to church today because
[1:52:30] it's formality
[1:52:32] or did you come today to offer spiritual
[1:52:34] sacrifice
[1:52:36] and offerings to the king what are we
[1:52:39] doing
[1:52:39] paul's here paul's hearing what is being
[1:52:41] spoke this is not my notes
[1:52:46] but then again
[1:52:50] maybe it would be easier for me saints
[1:52:52] to just tell you we're all
[1:52:54] going in the rapture praise god
[1:52:58] we're all we're all
[1:53:01] every one of us no matter what we've

[1:56:03] more nutrients or room in their world
[1:56:08] to grow amen does that mean they're lost
[1:56:11] no it doesn't it means god's going to
[1:56:13] come in the right time and place and
[1:56:15] jerk them out of their little container
[1:56:17] and he's going to crush their little
[1:56:19] roots and they're going to be all shook
[1:56:21] up what's going wrong lord what's going
[1:56:23] wrong why
[1:56:24] why i thought everything was good i'm a
[1:56:25] believer i'm a christian i'm a
[1:56:27] and god says i'm doing this for you you
[1:56:29] know i always say this was humor because
[1:56:31] it is kind of funny when you think about
[1:56:33] it because i remember my parents saying
[1:56:34] it and i said it to my children
[1:56:36] i have no doubt my children have said it
[1:56:38] to their children except for maybe
[1:56:40] not because i don't know that they whip
[1:56:42] their kids i mean spank their children
[1:56:45] i can remember as a kid my dad look at
[1:56:47] me in the face
[1:56:49] son you don't understand this hurts me
[1:56:50] worse than it hurts you and i'm like
[1:56:52] there ain't no way
[1:56:54] there is no way this is going to hurt
[1:56:57] you worse that's going to hurt me
[1:56:59] and after you got whipped and your feet
[1:57:01] come off the floor a few times you
[1:57:03] walked away from there going my dad's a
[1:57:05] liar
[1:57:06] there's no way he felt that and then i
[1:57:08] found myself a lot of years later
[1:57:10] looking my kids in the face especially
[1:57:11] my son joel
[1:57:13] son you just understand this is going to
[1:57:14] hurt me worse and it hurts you
[1:57:16] my son joel was a little different than
[1:57:18] me because i never had the courage to
[1:57:20] say it to my daddy
[1:57:21] my son joel looked me in the face and
[1:57:22] said you're not telling the truth dad
[1:57:24] there ain't no way that's going to hurt
[1:57:25] you
[1:57:29] but the truth of it is down in the
[1:57:30] spirit it does
[1:57:33] that's the truth of it we're not telling
[1:57:35] us
[1:57:36] and it actually hurts our lord jesus
[1:57:40] to come down and jerk you out of your
[1:57:42] little world and
[1:57:43] crush your roots and loosen them up
[1:57:47] and transplant you but it's necessary
[1:57:51] it has to happen because you see if it
[1:57:54] don't
[1:57:55] as we already read there we'll get
[1:57:57] caught in the cares of this world
[1:57:59] and we become root bound and we wither
[1:58:01] we pray we read our bible we go to
[1:58:04] church and god sent a prophet and we
[1:58:05] think we've got the answer to everything
[1:58:08] and our potential every day is declining
[1:58:12] declining declining declining
[1:58:18] now pardon me for even saying this but i
[1:58:20] want to drive this home to you
[1:58:24] then you can be in your late 70s
[1:58:27] followed the message for 55
[1:58:30] years and deny it
[1:58:36] how how
[1:58:39] i'll tell you how saints because someone
[1:58:42] let you
[1:58:43] or them i mean set in a pot
[1:58:46] and become root bound because i don't
[1:58:49] want to offend you i don't want to
[1:58:50] offend you
[1:58:51] i don't want to offend you i don't want
[1:58:53] to offend the body of believers
[1:58:54] well i'll tell you what i believe it's
[1:58:55] charles spurgeon says if you haven't
[1:58:57] offended someone when you preach you did
[1:58:59] not really
[1:59:01] i don't use that as an excuse but i'm
[1:59:03] telling you we've got to be
[1:59:05] taken out of our pot and our little
[1:59:07] roots of this cares of this life need to
[1:59:09] be crushed
[1:59:10] and transplanted into a place we can
[1:59:13] grow
[1:59:13] amen oh god help us oh my
[1:59:18] saints i shouldn't even ask can i have a
[1:59:19] few more minutes hallelujah
[1:59:22] look at this i tell you i i love this
[1:59:24] now i want to give you some
[1:59:26] example i'll try and hurry through this
[1:59:28] in luke 7 37
[1:59:30] amen i knew just this morning i thought
[1:59:32] i'm not even going to say i'm going to
[1:59:33] try and be short
[1:59:34] i'm just acknowledging that there's just
[1:59:36] so much here but it's all tied together
[1:59:38] hallelujah that's kind of like going to
[1:59:39] the house and they tell you here's the
[1:59:41] salad to start off with come back
[1:59:42] tomorrow and we'll serve you something
[1:59:44] else
[1:59:44] no sir when you go there and sit down
[1:59:47] saints don't bring me to your house
[1:59:49] and tell me that you'll invite me back
[1:59:51] in a month or two for the steak
[1:59:52] but right now here's the salad and the
[1:59:54] greens
[1:59:56] come on don't do it to me don't do it
[1:59:59] i'll stay at your house all day if
[2:00:00] that's what it takes for you to get that
[2:00:02] stake on the plate
[2:00:06] luke 7 37 behold a woman in the city
[2:00:11] which was just like me a sinner
[2:00:15] when she knew that jesus said it meet in
[2:00:16] the pharisees house and
[2:00:18] brought an alabaster box of ointment
[2:00:20] stood at his feet behind him
[2:00:22] weeping and began to wash his feet with
[2:00:25] her with tears
[2:00:27] did wipe them with the hairs of her head
[2:00:30] kissed his feet and anointed them with
[2:00:32] ointment now when the pharisee which had
[2:00:34] bitten him saw it
[2:00:35] spake within himself saying this man if
[2:00:37] he were a prophet
[2:00:38] if he was a prophet if he was spiritual
[2:00:41] would have known
[2:00:42] who in what manner of woman that is that
[2:00:45] touches
[2:00:45] him for she is a sinner
[2:00:49] do you know where they got the idea of
[2:00:52] superman having x-ray vision
[2:00:56] i'm speaking serious the inspiration of
[2:00:59] that comes out of this
[2:01:00] word of god because he
[2:01:04] sees and discerns the spirit of the
[2:01:06] people the pharisee says
[2:01:09] if he knew what manner of woman that was
[2:01:13] he did he did
[2:01:17] look saints he didn't look at her and
[2:01:18] say whoa you're a prostitute what are
[2:01:20] you doing here
[2:01:24] oh sorry i spilled that
[2:01:29] now in the pharisees this man if you
[2:01:31] were a prophet would have known what
[2:01:32] manner of woman
[2:01:34] touches him jesus answering said in him
[2:01:36] simon i have someone to say to you
[2:01:39] i'm gonna i'm gonna upgrade you simon
[2:01:40] i'm gonna call you to the carpet i'm
[2:01:42] i'm gonna let you know simon how messed
[2:01:45] up you are
[2:01:46] master say on there was a certain
[2:01:48] creditor which had two debtors
[2:01:50] the one owed 500 pence and the other 50
[2:01:52] and when they had nothing to pay he
[2:01:54] frankly forgave them both
[2:01:56] tell me therefore which of them will
[2:01:57] love him most
[2:01:59] simon being a fairly smart guy wasn't
[2:02:01] too hard i mean he's good at counting
[2:02:02] money in his head
[2:02:04] not very good at discerning spirits or
[2:02:06] being spiritual
[2:02:07] but he didn't have any problem figuring
[2:02:09] out this money part
[2:02:11] probably was a good preacher
[2:02:16] simon answered and said i suppose that
[2:02:18] he to whom he forgave most
[2:02:20] he said unto him thou hast rightly
[2:02:23] judged
[2:02:25] and he turned to the woman now get this
[2:02:28] turned to the woman and said to simon
[2:02:32] you see actually simon's falling out of
[2:02:33] the conversation now
[2:02:36] see us thou this woman i had entered
[2:02:38] into thine house
[2:02:40] now gave us me no water from my feet but
[2:02:42] she has washed my feet
[2:02:44] with tears and wipe them with the hairs
[2:02:47] of her head
[2:02:48] thou gave us me no kiss but this woman
[2:02:51] since time i come in hath not ceased to
[2:02:54] kiss
[2:02:54] my feet my head with oil
[2:02:57] did us not anoint but this woman hath
[2:03:00] anointed
[2:03:01] my feet with ointment
[2:03:06] wherefore ascended thee her sins which
[2:03:09] were many
[2:03:09] are forgiven for she loved much
[2:03:13] but to whom little is forgiven the same
[2:03:17] loveth little
[2:03:21] you didn't see simon approaching jesus
[2:03:24] and saying
[2:03:25] forgive me forgive me
[2:03:29] you see he had very little love
[2:03:34] very little
[2:03:38] but you see my brother and sister here
[2:03:40] was a woman
[2:03:41] i'll just speak it plain to you a
[2:03:43] prostitute
[2:03:45] now that's my i hope our children god
[2:03:48] blocked their ears
[2:03:51] this is a woman that night
[2:03:55] after night did not just sit in her
[2:03:58] house
[2:04:00] and cry for the bitterness of her life
[2:04:04] but this was a woman who night after
[2:04:07] night
[2:04:08] was debased in the eyes of man
[2:04:12] this was a woman that every day that
[2:04:14] went by
[2:04:16] sunk lower and lower and lower
[2:04:20] in the image of the world around her
[2:04:23] this was not i can go on i can be
[2:04:26] respectable
[2:04:27] she was trapped in her pot
[2:04:33] she was root bound
[2:04:36] i am marked i have nowhere to go
[2:04:40] i have no way i will always be
[2:04:44] the woman from down there on the corner
[2:04:52] but something happened
[2:04:56] she didn't put announcement out she
[2:04:58] didn't tell everybody come see what i'm
[2:04:59] going to do she was anointed
[2:05:02] and she went and history will tell you
[2:05:05] that she actually was not even welcomed
[2:05:09] in that house it would have only been
[2:05:11] god himself that
[2:05:12] provided a way for her to get in there
[2:05:15] god's provided way my brother and sister
[2:05:17] not man
[2:05:18] not the church not this preacher not
[2:05:20] that preacher god's provided way brought
[2:05:22] her to a place
[2:05:23] and as it was that it's there and is
[2:05:25] this and we see the word of god coming
[2:05:27] forth
[2:05:28] see how it's broke down right there and
[2:05:30] he says unto her
[2:05:31] thy sins are forgiven what has he done
[2:05:34] he's pulled her out of her root bound
[2:05:35] condition
[2:05:36] and he's taken her over here and said
[2:05:38] i'm going to plant you in good soil
[2:05:40] i'm going to put you in a place under
[2:05:42] the water of the word under the sunlight
[2:05:44] of the sun
[2:05:45] and you will grow
[2:05:48] and they just said at me with him begin
[2:05:50] to say within themselves who is that to
[2:05:52] forgive his sins also
[2:05:53] and that didn't matter he's now
[2:05:55] dismissed simon he's dismissed the
[2:05:57] unbeliever
[2:05:58] he's dismissed all the make-believers
[2:06:00] he's dismissed everything and he says to
[2:06:02] her thy faith is save thee
[2:06:04] go in peace my brother and sister she
[2:06:07] did not go out of there
[2:06:08] and book another customer she was
[2:06:11] changed
[2:06:12] it was overnight you might say or
[2:06:15] instant
[2:06:20] is that clear enough hallelujah can i
[2:06:23] move on just a little bit
[2:06:25] look we look in john 4 4. we see the
[2:06:28] scripture he says and
[2:06:30] he must needs go through samaria
[2:06:33] that's just a little foundation you see
[2:06:35] god never just absolutely
[2:06:37] absently did something god just wasn't
[2:06:39] oh i run into this person how lucky
[2:06:42] no no sorry
[2:06:45] no sorry i i i'm torn whether to even
[2:06:49] share this from my own heart and i think
[2:06:51] it'll be beneficial not to
[2:06:53] but i can tell you one of the thoughts
[2:06:55] that the devil
[2:06:57] put in my mind this morning
[2:07:02] was an event that damaged my family
[2:07:07] shocked my wife and my children many
[2:07:09] years ago
[2:07:12] happened about this time of the year
[2:07:15] the devil come this morning tried to
[2:07:17] remind me
[2:07:21] and i just realized by god's grace
[2:07:24] the devil had had his way i wouldn't be
[2:07:26] here and i wouldn't have for many years
[2:07:28] i would have been gone it would have
[2:07:30] been history
[2:07:32] maybe a name on a little stone somewhere
[2:07:35] but god rich in mercy god rich and mercy
[2:07:40] said i'm here to minister to your needs
[2:07:42] i'm here to deal with whatever's
[2:07:44] happening in your life
[2:07:45] it don't matter big or small i'm able to
[2:07:47] take care of it
[2:07:48] i'm here to raise you up into heavenly
[2:07:50] places i'm here to use you
[2:07:53] if you'll let me use you
[2:07:57] amen
[2:08:03] now we know this story right this a
[2:08:04] woman at the well
[2:08:08] now we understand my brother and sister
[2:08:10] that jesus says i have needs to go
[2:08:11] through samaria
[2:08:13] i've got an appointment to keep i'm
[2:08:15] gonna i'm gonna go down this way
[2:08:17] and here's this little lady living in
[2:08:19] samaria now my brother and sister she
[2:08:21] might not have been identified as a
[2:08:22] prostitute but she had had five husbands
[2:08:24] which in that day and age was the same
[2:08:26] as
[2:08:30] jesus tells the disciples
[2:08:34] guys um i won't need
[2:08:37] your misunderstandings
[2:08:40] i won't need your maybe judgmental
[2:08:43] approach
[2:08:44] i won't need you guys questioning
[2:08:47] so i'm just going to send you all the
[2:08:49] town because this is something
[2:08:52] that's just between
[2:08:55] her and me
[2:09:00] well thank you lord i like that
[2:09:03] i like that when it comes down that it's
[2:09:05] just between you and god
[2:09:06] amen you know i i don't i'm not real
[2:09:09] comfortable myself and needing to
[2:09:11] interject myself into your life
[2:09:13] and your life and your life to make sure
[2:09:16] that somehow it's going to come out
[2:09:18] right
[2:09:19] it's just really nice to just let it be
[2:09:21] between you
[2:09:22] and god i was talking to a brother just
[2:09:25] a few days ago
[2:09:28] and he asked me a little question
[2:09:32] and i say this as a compliment saints i
[2:09:34] hope you don't ever think i was shirking
[2:09:36] my job
[2:09:37] i probably have a few times but forgive
[2:09:39] me for that
[2:09:41] brother made a comment to me and i gave
[2:09:44] him a comment back i said brother
[2:09:45] i believe in rugged christians i believe
[2:09:48] if you have a question
[2:09:51] you pray about it you don't need to come
[2:09:54] and say no pastor
[2:09:56] should i shouldn't i have you prayed
[2:09:59] about it
[2:10:01] go pray about it get in the spirit
[2:10:04] pray through god said he would answer
[2:10:07] you
[2:10:07] as long as the pastor is in the room
[2:10:12] no i misquoted that one didn't i oh that
[2:10:15] was out of nicolaitan
[2:10:17] chapter four
[2:10:21] i believe in rugged christians i believe
[2:10:24] god has done
[2:10:25] that we come to a time like as in china
[2:10:27] right now that they're persecuting
[2:10:29] all the all the believers all the
[2:10:30] christian churches they're persecuting
[2:10:32] that
[2:10:33] it hasn't stopped the church the church
[2:10:34] is exploding the chinese government's
[2:10:36] more afraid
[2:10:37] of the christian church in china than
[2:10:39] they are of the united states
[2:10:45] because the harder they press on it the
[2:10:47] more there are
[2:10:49] well hallelujah you never now pardon me
[2:10:51] we don't drink wine around here except
[2:10:53] for communion
[2:10:54] and i'm telling you if you don't ever
[2:10:55] squeeze the grape
[2:10:57] you don't ever get the juice
[2:11:01] the more they're squeezing the christian
[2:11:03] church
[2:11:04] the more it's happening amen well
[2:11:08] hallelujah i'll tell you my brother and
[2:11:10] sister there's been more people
[2:11:12] backsliding the united states from being
[2:11:13] a christian because life was too easy
[2:11:15] than there was from being too hard
[2:11:19] so look at this woman he says now look
[2:11:21] uh you know he says to the
[2:11:23] to the saints there he says now you guys
[2:11:24] just all go and
[2:11:26] um so it's there and we see what
[2:11:29] happened right
[2:11:30] we see the whole context of she comes he
[2:11:32] starts talking to her she says hey look
[2:11:34] now no wait wait i'm this i'm that
[2:11:36] you're that
[2:11:37] he tells her no no you don't even know
[2:11:39] where you worship
[2:11:40] you know you guys don't even have
[2:11:41] revelation but when it comes to a
[2:11:44] certain point
[2:11:46] he says something and she's like
[2:11:50] that's what i've looked for
[2:11:55] a woman with five husbands is
[2:11:58] acknowledging that's what i've looked
[2:12:00] for
[2:12:01] my whole life this
[2:12:04] is what i'm looking for
[2:12:08] and i perceive that you must
[2:12:11] be a prophet amen
[2:12:15] now let's go into my thought what did
[2:12:18] she do a woman that had to go to the
[2:12:21] well at a certain time of day because
[2:12:22] she could not associate with those
[2:12:24] around her
[2:12:26] now under an anointing she didn't step
[2:12:29] out of her place she didn't say no i
[2:12:30] believe i'm called to be a preacher
[2:12:34] no she went down
[2:12:39] she started preaching in the correct
[2:12:42] fashion
[2:12:44] i had this experience this man
[2:12:47] told me all about my life
[2:12:52] she starts testifying everything he
[2:12:55] knows he spoke it
[2:12:56] he's the messiah this is what we're
[2:12:58] looking for and this is the result many
[2:13:00] of the samaritans of that city
[2:13:02] believed on him
[2:13:06] for the saying of the woman
[2:13:10] which testified he told me all that i
[2:13:12] ever did
[2:13:13] so when the samaritans were coming unto
[2:13:15] him they besought him
[2:13:16] that he would tarry with them and he
[2:13:18] abode their two days
[2:13:20] and many more believe because of his
[2:13:23] own word and said unto the woman
[2:13:27] now we believe not because
[2:13:30] you said so
[2:13:33] not just because you said so but
[2:13:39] we have heard him ourselves
[2:13:43] but you see they never would have come
[2:13:44] from the city to hear him
[2:13:46] except for she caught a revelation and
[2:13:49] went and told them
[2:13:50] this man has told me everything i ever
[2:13:52] done
[2:13:53] and this little woman that they would
[2:13:55] have looked at with the
[2:13:56] most demeaning approach we had such as
[2:14:00] a ring of sincerity such a truth coming
[2:14:03] from her
[2:14:04] such a revelation coming out they said
[2:14:06] we gotta go see what affected her like
[2:14:08] this
[2:14:08] she's lived her life she's hard she's
[2:14:11] callous
[2:14:12] she's been through everything she has
[2:14:14] been pardoned me for saying this
[2:14:15] she has been loved and left she has been
[2:14:18] abused and mistreated
[2:14:20] she's been dumped she's been despised
[2:14:22] and she's coming here saying
[2:14:24] there's one who's told me all about my
[2:14:26] life and who i
[2:14:27] am and what i was called for
[2:14:30] and they said we gotta go see what this
[2:14:33] is and because of
[2:14:34] her words they went but they're coming
[2:14:37] back and acknowledging
[2:14:38] just like you and i should be
[2:14:40] acknowledging we don't believe just
[2:14:42] because someone told us
[2:14:43] we believe because we have heard we have
[2:14:46] heard the word of god for our hour
[2:14:48] we've heard his voice he spoke to us
[2:14:51] in the quiet of the midnight hour his
[2:14:54] word is speaking to us
[2:14:55] as brother chris preached my brother and
[2:14:57] sister we're not just going to take
[2:14:59] someone else's word for it
[2:15:01] we want to touch and put our hand in his
[2:15:04] hand
[2:15:04] we're not going to just settle for some
[2:15:07] kind of hey
[2:15:08] this is what this is so-and-so said i
[2:15:11] gotta meet him myself
[2:15:12] i gotta hear from him myself i've gotta
[2:15:15] know this word myself
[2:15:16] because of christ my brother and sister
[2:15:18] the anointed one
[2:15:20] has come in spirit and in truth
[2:15:24] hallelujah i love this i got so
[2:15:28] inspired i'm sorry except for my office
[2:15:30] it's so little it's hard to run around
[2:15:31] in a circle when there's only room
[2:15:33] enough for a chair
[2:15:34] but i got so expire many more be
[2:15:38] believed because of
[2:15:41] it says his own word but the word
[2:15:45] many believe because the word spoke to
[2:15:48] them
[2:15:50] not just a word the word spoke to them
[2:15:54] and the woman i believe this must
[2:15:58] would have been spoken the right context
[2:16:00] because you could put just a little bit
[2:16:02] now i didn't believe
[2:16:03] i didn't believe because her
[2:16:07] no no no not you don't you you testified
[2:16:09] you witnessed to me but don't you get
[2:16:11] any ideas you had anything to do with
[2:16:12] this
[2:16:14] well that's right and wrong because god
[2:16:17] uses who he will
[2:16:18] to speak said unto the woman
[2:16:22] now we believe not because of thy saying
[2:16:26] but thank you lord we heard
[2:16:29] him ourselves
[2:16:32] oh hallelujah and we know that this is
[2:16:34] indeed the christ
[2:16:36] the savior of the world sister emmy
[2:16:38] would you come
[2:16:40] look at this my brother and sister
[2:16:43] we have heard him amen ourselves how
[2:16:45] beautiful that is
[2:16:47] now look we were speaking of the first
[2:16:50] lady
[2:16:51] how god replanted her look how quickly
[2:16:54] god changed this lady's position

[2:17:08] have already got their water i can go
