for sunday amen uh anyway just really happy to see you brother sergey i thought maybe you might be off into the far reaches of the lands but good to see you here tonight and uh we've traded chris and kristen for hannah and uh you know hannah being my sister-in-law um and you know when jerry and i got married she was just a young girl and uh you know just so nobody will must understand i've been in love with her since she was just about i don't know how old was she about 10 years old or something anyway she's just very special to jerry and i and glad to have you here amen glad to have each and every one of you here tonight amen let's just uh go i want to once again go into the book of proverbs and um just uh look at this you know such wisdom that is here if we just stand to our feet as we go into the word proverbs the 28th chapter and now as we've been going through this saints it's um not as though we've been trying to speak on every single chapter every single verse but just been reading and those things that kind of give you might say a inspiration uh you know and we might backtrack on some of this but um just to look at uh these things and um i pray that what is an inspiration to me will also be an inspiration to you uh and uh we are truly blessed and happy our young people brother chris sister christian have have taken this upon themselves a real burden uh we're not talking about just something like oh hey i've got to do this but i'll just tell you out front all of this has been chris coming and saying what do you think we do this what do you think about pursuing this and i i'm actually quite thrilled that he has that desire that uh enthusiasm of youth to um connect with our youth and i i think it's been beneficial i think we're seeing a great progress there so let's just be praying for them just as our brothers have said we just really want them to go to camp and as i have mentioned in several services we don't want them coming home saying yay we won the volleyball we want him to come home saying you know what i heard some preaching and it touched my heart and it's changed my life and i received the holy ghost and and i just really want to serve the lord and and then we will continue if the lord tarries to to encourage them and do what we can do as a group of believers to keep uh um pressing on and entering in and and them going and and not only making friends uh you know of other believers young people because i think saints it is good when young people can come face to face with people and if i don't have the words just exactly right forgive me but young people they might i'm going to use the words admire they would look at that and go oh you know a sister saying this is a really fine sister a brother saying this is a really fine brother a friend and and encouraging to them to realize they're not the only ones there are other people you know one time a long time ago a man told me he says a thing about i don't like about he had a kind of a work perspective here because thing i don't like about christians they're all boring but that's because his idea of what was not boring was just the things of the world and you guys are boring and i was like yes but what you don't realize is so are you and uh so anyway proverbs the 28th chapter verses one through six amen the wicked flee when no man pursueth but the righteous are bold as a lion for the transgression of a land many are the princes thereof but by a man of understanding and knowledge the state thereof shall be prolonged a poor man that oppresseth the poor is like a sweeping reign which leaveth no food they that forsake the law praise the wicked but such as keep the law contend with them evil men understand not judgment now because it's not going to be one of my thoughts tonight i want to just throw this in look at this spirit that is in the land that people push back against christianity whatever they're living any old way and then they say don't judge me don't jud you're judging me the bible says you're not to judge me but that's not what the bible says the bible says that all things are judged and all men sins either go before them or follow after them and i just listening to the prophet of god and he put it in these words and he says now the very god they claim to serve and love will judge them so we want to make sure ours go before us we want it clean amen i don't mind and i don't believe you mind being judged by the word you see the being judged by the word is not someone saying you're wrong or you're this or you're that but the word judging us is god's way of correcting us those he loves he chastens so the word comes and chastens us and if we're in the right spirit in the right attitude we're saying thank you lord we're not we're not looking to the preacher we're not looking to anything we're looking and saying thank you lord because you're now causing me to to look at my own life and compare it and if it comes up short forgive me lord amen aren't you glad i'm kind of glad now half of my family is catholic i'm kind of glad i'm not catholic because you've got to do all kinds of things to be forgiven as a catholic but we have just to apply the blood of jesus christ just to come and say lord forgive me amen evil men understand not judgment but they that seek the lord understand all things better is the poor that walketh in his uprightness than he that is perverse in his ways though he be rich heavenly father we're asking you this evening father just help us to be concise father lord we know that you're in control of all things and father just help us tonight to be able to speak directly father just to share this and not hold the saints too long in this heat and father once again we lift up our brother chris sister christian and we lift up our young people all the young people lord our brother dwayne who will be preaching the youth camp father lord may you just give unction to him give anointing to him let the words not be his words lord but let it be your voice speaking to the people the young people and let them hear father not a man's voice but your voice father may each and every young person every grown-up father there at the camp lord be changed by the preaching of the word lord we ask this and we ask for your guidance your wisdom and understanding your forgiveness for our short comings lord tonight in the name of jesus christ amen you may be seated saints now i i do want to just say this is just kind of a little word to you real quick uh sister jerry and i was in paraguay a few years ago and um would love to take some of you with us there again just as long as you're not squeamish because it was about 114 and the deacons were walking around with one cup and a pitcher of water and they were going down the row and if you were squeamish you didn't get a drink but seeing how you had been sweating and clapping and shouting and everybody's packed together pre-covered of course and uh you know you look at that cup and you're like well praise the lord the lord will keep me amen i tell you that's oftentimes the way i view the communion cup right i'm not speaking against anybody who ever drinks out of the little cups but it doesn't say cups it says cup amen now we look at this and i want to just take a few minutes this evening and just kind of touch upon these six verses i got a couple little quotes to quote uh to to quote at the very end to just kind of make a point but it says the wicked flee when no man pursueth and we know my brother and sister just in the human nature that a guilty conscience tends to cause the behavior of a person to change and often times as they study behavior of people they can tell what is going on with someone by their hands their gestures their eyes their reactions and you look at this and we know that in the age that we live in the prophet of god showed us very clearly that there's only two spirits and so it is then that spirit right of right and wrong and it is that that that people sometimes they they just can't help themselves because deep down within themselves they know that they are not doing the right thing and so the wicked flee no man is pursuing but the thing is my brother and sister is the conscience is always there and so a guilty conscience causes people to act or react in different ways but here it says the righteous are as bold as a lion now if we are looking at this in these scriptures here and looking how it is that we approach god my brother and sister the wicked flee now i i you know only can say it thank you lord it's by his grace but my brother and sister when we backslid and i spent those years of my life backstage i i know this firsthand we tend to run from the very thing we need it's just an interesting thing of humanity that we run away from the very thing that we need it reminds me of a story of of some people who uh uh were down in death valley in california uh they didn't have enough gas for one they took no extra drinking water they had nothing and they run their car out of gas and the man should have just stayed there in the shade of his car with his family done his best to to uh preserve that um but he he said you know uh family you stay here i'm going to go they had driven like 57 miles out into death valley and he said i'm going to walk for help and you know by the time somebody noticed a vehicle there and stopped and rescued the wife and the children she said my husband went that direction for help and when they found the man he was so delirious that he actually ran from them they were trying to help him and he just went running off across the desert uh no telling what he was actually thinking but he he was so confused in his thinking that the very help he needed he ran from and i i would just like to type that back tonight that the wicked flee from god when he's the very thing that they need the whole solution to their problem and you know the righteous uh my brother and sister are as bold as a lion now some people would take this scripture and they would say that you should pin everybody you come down and tell them they're going to hell but this is not in continuity with the rest of the word but my brother and sister have you ever noticed how satan tries to make us timid as believers now we we are to turn the other cheek there's a lot of scriptures that will balance that you know that we should uh you know if they ask for your uh cloak you you give them the whole garment all of these different scriptures but it doesn't say anywhere that we are called to be timid and we are called to stand for what we believe were to stand upon the word unwavering and the righteous are bold as a lion now let's take this as i just shared in the continuity or context of coming to god we do not come as beggars do we we do not come as it is timid see we have to understand the difference of timid and respectful timid and uh coming in in uh um the words escaping me oh my to come in reverence no we need to we need to find that balance timid is not the solution we come and i always like and you know this i love to use esther as an example esther did not come into the fourier of the palace and crawl to the throne she come and presented herself not boisterous not demanding but knowing that her husband loved her she came boldly she didn't send a note and have it smuggled to him she presented herself ready to meet the king oh i think there's a lot to be said in that not coming she didn't show up in a house coat she didn't show up in her hair in curlers he might have just loved her the same that way she was his wife but my brother and sister she knew how to present herself to the king and she came a presentable amen she was bold truly bold to come we would look at the shutamite woman my brother and sister she did not come groveling but she come even to the point to say all is well all is well why because did she have a false hope no she had a confidence she came boldly knowing that in a moment when the timing is right she didn't come groveling my baby's dead you know you promised this why did you make this happen she just come and she knew the moment would be right and the spirit of god moving on the prophet recognized her spirit was troubled and the door is open for her then to speak so we want to come my brother and sister not with a guilty conscience not as it is in first john you know this is i hate to admit this right but we might as well all just put the rubber on the road have you ever experienced this i think every one of us as believers would say we've experienced this if our heart condemn us not you see if our hearts condemning us then we we just can't even hardly even pray even the meagerist of prayers but if we are coming in confidence right boldly coming in a confidence that we are sons and daughters of god and the scripture says that he is quick to forgive us we don't have and that's why i made the comment earlier we don't have a ritual we have to follow through to find forgiveness we have the utter simplicity of the gospel to come and say lord forgive me and it is a finished work so if our heart condemn us not then we have confidence toward god and so i have i'm ashamed to say this but i'm human i have had it times that it would be as though i had maybe a terrible day and my phone rings and somebody says brother paul this situation this situation this situation can you pray and you're there thinking why would god answer my prayer why would i you know it's like of all the days if they would have called yesterday or the day before or last sunday i would have boldly stood and said we're going to the throne and we are going to change this but it seems like the day that i have fallen down the day that i have i don't know let's just take something simple then impatience and maybe even angry i know none of you have that problem and it's at that moment ring ring but we're learning in that time we're still sons and daughters of god in that time we still have access to the throne so what do we do we deal with the condemnation first how do you deal with condemnation true repentance wipes away all condemnation aren't you glad my my dad when he was in the navy was a flight engineer and one time bogota colombia they flew in there there was different diplomats and different things dealing with the government of colombia and they said you know go stay in the heart of the city don't go out into the the suburbs don't go anywhere no blind alleys no dark alleys no whatever's just stay so my dad just went right in the heart of bogota colombia and walked around and literally come upon this saint this is not a story this is my dad's personal witness that there was a man catholic church my dad raised catholic and uh catholic church and here is a man crawling up to the steps and they were chip stone you know uh steps and on his knees and he's praying a prayer and crying out to mary and then moving up to the next step and my dad as he observed this he actually went up those three or four flights of stairs and went in and walked through the church and the man was from the same tier out of i think it was three or four i'm not i don't remember exactly and already blood on the steps behind him crying out to mary for forgiveness aren't you glad i'm glad not just for the physical pain my brother and sister but for the revelation to know that the blood of jesus christ wipes away washes away all sin it's not about persevering to to be crippled as it were to to bring that to pass so we we want to come as it were uh as bold as a lion my brother and sister so that means we got to keep the slate clean right amen we've got to just keep wiping the slate clean and we do that by the blood of jesus christ amen so now i like verse 2 in the sense for the transgression of a land many are the princes they're relevant i i tell you you know the prophet of god now i didn't go ahead and go into this quote yes if you please go back to that scripture brother uh isaac uh now i didn't bring up these quotes we know them amen but brother branham says that america being so far gone that a george washington and abraham lincoln on every corner will not change the direction of our nation and he has some words that are even stronger than that but we'll look at this my brother and sister we'll see that many the transgression of land many are the princes thereof and i want you to just look in the world we're living in today and there are many princes of this there's the princes of hollywood and the princes of this pleasure and that pleasure and there's princes everywhere promoting all of these things that are a transgression before god and and they're everywhere and they're widely accepted it there are so many of these princes presenting themselves and i would say in this context so we would understand there's many princesses to go with the princes and so it's there that we look and and now pardon me i hope none of you hold to these things because i'm just going to blast it for a minute but the whole world is judging a fashion and what is moral and presentable by some people named kardashian and they're going gonna get kardashian all right uh they're gonna come a day that without repenting they're they're gonna find a judgment that's going to dash all their hopes and these people and i'll bring this out just to make a point these people are so fringe in their idea of who god is to evade taxes they started their own church so they can give millions to their own church and now they're priests and priests uh priestesses of their own religion and therefore they can draw salary without paying wages or an expense account without paying taxes on this and so this is how little they see or how little respect and i should have brought that quote up instead of just trying to paraphrase it here but the prophet of god said that come to a day that they will manhandle and mishandle the word of god with no respect or reverence so it's a good tax write-off and then people dress and act like these people you see what kind of princes of the land that they are choosing but by a man of understanding and knowledge the state thereof shall be prolonged now i want you to look at this my brother and sister that when we're talking about prolonged here this is as it were ties right back to uh the fact that even though the word says that time would be shortened the prophet of god shows us clearly how that god is not going to cut this off until you and i are ready and this is something that we want to look at in the context of hey i'm not going to just drag this out that's not what the spirit of the believer is the spirit believer wants to stand in the presence of the son and be brought to maturity we're not wanting to drag this out amen in fact you look around and it actually kind of is sickening what we see in the world today uh so we'll see how that many evil around us uh but you know the lord is keeping us can anyone can you agree tonight the lord is keeping us in this present world amen in this present darkness god is keeping us now that doesn't mean we're mistake free but under the anointing of the word we are repentant people and we find liberty in the blood of jesus christ now this message my brother and sister and i say this emphatic this message is a message of liberty if one feels like they are bound inside the constraints of this message there is something wrong there there is an altar to be found there is repentance to be brought a changing of the thinking and you'll find this and i'm not going to get sidetracked into this but you'll find that many of the people that are quitting say oh now that we're gone i feel so free but a message of liberty is what sets us free it is not the spirit of laodicea my brother and sister the word shows us so clearly that in the year of the jubilee as they come to make the decision of what they viewed as security some were secure to put their ear to the post and have an all driven through it that was their idea of security they'll take care of me from the cradle to the grave but you see this bride's not looking from cradle to grave we're looking as it were from the foundations of the world to eternity at the throne of god we're not concerned about cradle and grave we're not concerned about these things we have a much bigger picture that by god's grace so let's go back to that scripture right here and just kind of touch on that again here amen for transgression of a land many are the princes thereof but by a man of understanding and knowledge amen that's how we're able to look at this picture entirely different than the world now i have no i no doubt my brother and sister if i could just put this that that donald trump being president of the united states had a tremendous effect he he made it so that people had a liberty to stand up and say we love the lord you know all these things and and and he made that very comfortable but you know we can look at this and and i i don't want to get in it tonight and people have different perspectives even to the point that at a point in time people were like you know uh donald trump is a savior of our nation no i'm sorry jesus christ is the savior of our nation and our nation is rejecting him they like the tax breaks and they like the liberties and they like all of this but that's not what this nation was founded on amen so we'll see how the thinking of man has become even warped in the time that we live in so i'm glad i'll say tonight i can lift my hand and say the lord is keeping us in this present time now look he's using people get confused about this right because we're living in a world that we're saying lord come quickly we want to be out of here we want to be done we don't identify with this world but look how this works god is using the resources of this corrupt world to provide for you and i know now you want to type in scripture for that anybody neither type in scripture when israel was coming out of goshen god anointed them to be bold and they went to their egyptian neighbors and said give me your cart give me your wheat give me your pots and pans give me this give me that and they under an anointing were not able to reject them so god gave provision i hope you see this broad picture god gave provision of egypt for them to go to the promised land and we are seeing that once again right here right now god giving us provision out of this world to go to the promised land now it's the word of god that gets us to the promised land but god knows how to sustain us naturally amen that's all part of the plan of god so we look at this because my brother and sister some people are like well well we just when's the lord gonna come when's the lord gonna come let's get in the presence of the son and get mature we want the lord to come get in the presence of the son and get mature god's not going to take an immature bride look i i've shared this story before i don't want to discredit brother donnie by sharing this and maybe not getting it right but i remember brother donny talking about how it would be a scenario that maybe a man would call him up and say brother donnie um i'm engaged and uh you know i want with my fiance to come and talk to you to get ready for a wedding and brother donny would say come on down i'll meet you in the office and the brother comes in there and walks in with a twelve-year-old [Music] no brother donna'd be like oh brother you're confused you're confused this is not a bride this is a child right you take a mature woman to a wedding you don't take a child we're not perverted like some countries amen and god's not going to take an immature bride right and then when she's in heaven grow her up no sir this is our season this is our time we're standing in the presence of the sun coming into a full maturity of the revelation of the redemption of almighty god that plan of redemption which we can tie directly over into the seals and the seventh seal the whole plan of redemption revealed so the plan of redemption is open to you and i now we come into the maturity of that plan of redemption that mystery amen just because it was open we don't go in as a mature bride amen i mean immature bright so this is our season of maturing for the bride this is a season of prophetic fulfillment there is a lot of prophecy my brother and sister that still has to come to pass now some people are like well we quit believing that brother branham was a prophet of god because this this and this and this haven't come to pass well my brother and sister even in this great age of technology we don't know what happened in india today we don't know the miracles i'm just talking about the worldly things we don't know the miracles that happen in africa today we don't know what happened in europe today or asia today we don't know what happened in the little church or the prayer room many things are being fulfilled that people will say well i can't believe this because this wasn't fulfilled god didn't say i'm going to put it on cnn god didn't say i'm going to blast it to the whole world when somebody has come and as it were prophesied and watch it come to pass and when i say prophesy as sons and daughters of god we are called to prophesy do you know that we are not called to just be mute but we are called to prophesy and prophecy can in its utter form be as simple as declaring god's going to heal me i believe it and so you are then speaking what is going to take place in your life and i want to ask you tonight have you ever seen that happen i have seen god answer prayer time after time and we have voiced the things not out of some supreme confidence or you know arrogance but we were speaking because the word said speak those things that are not as though they are and those things that are as though they are not you got to speak it so you what you are doing you are coming as i'm going to put it these terms and you'll understand a minor prophet speaking the very things that are going to come to pass in your life that's why when like our young people going off to camp if they can get right down there in camp and stand in that atmosphere and say lord those that maybe don't have the holy ghost say lord i want the holy ghost i need it i claim it and god says there you are you're speaking it you're speaking it i'm going to answer that prophecy i'm going to answer that word and i'm going to fulfill that and the bible's clear full my brother and sister of these examples of men speaking those things and it coming to pass hallelujah are we any different did you know this is a sideline note probably ruined another sermon i had my mind but did you know you are completely interchangeable in the body of christ are you with me in other words god if he had chose could have taken you and put you in the colosseum brother paul i don't like big cats no no saints the faith that is in you your ability to believe and manifest the word means god could have taken you and put you into the colosseum he could have put you in the first church age second third fourth fifth sixth but god in his infinite wisdom says you know what i'm going to come down in the darkest of ages and i've got a people already selected this is predestination a people already selected that will stand in laodicea and so god would say they would overcome in the first stage if i'd have put them there they'd overcome in the second age if i would have put them there and the third and the fourth and the fifth and the sixth but i chose them for leo to see i chose them for the seventh age but you're completely interchangeable so you say oh my look at this saints there with the apostle paul and look what was happening over here and look what's happening happening there do you realize my brother sister come on i hope you catch it you realize god could have placed you there if he had chose to and you would not have failed praise the lord you would have been an overcomer there just like you are an overcomer here hallelujah amen so the lord's keeping us amen a season of prophetic fulfillment because every word is going to be fulfilled every single word hallelujah now i want to move forward because i just i'm overheating verse 3 a poor man that oppresses the poor is like a sweeping rain which leaveth no food now my brother and sister you'll look at this and i think that's pretty self-explanatory if you've ever been we just had one of those kind of rainstorms out there at the farm the other day and it rained so hard for about 15 minutes 20 minutes max everything was muddy you couldn't do anything we were just basically done but before the sun went down that night the ground was completely dry again a sweeping rain now if you go look it up brother branham uses this term in like a prayer talking about a revival moving like a sweeping rain in other words he was referencing it to coming and passing over everyone so don't get confused this is not a conflict brother brown's using this as a term of a rain that comes and a moving of the holy spirit sweeping across the whole church but you look at this now what they're saying here is a rain that come and it left an evidence of its presence but there was nothing that soaked down into the roots of the plant to bring a continued life and the scripture now saying here it is a poor man that oppresses the poor is like a sweeping reign so there's something there that that just is incongruent with with what should be you would think that a poor man would have sympathy for a poor man you would think that one that had been through great trials and travails would have mercy on those that were around them but they like a sweeping rain come through had an impact that had no lasting positive effect in other words what they did didn't help the poor didn't change the direction of anything now you know we have scripture to to uh go with this amen let's just grab this right here in matthew 18. let's look at this now how it is that a poor man can oppress one another right here perfect example in scripture for us then came petered him and said lord how oft shall my brother sin against me and i forgive him any of you ever thought about that one of course none of you have ever been offended or had someone do something to you right we've all just grown up in just a perfect atmosphere i remember one time a minister brother told me he said brother paul he said it confuses me to a degree as a man of how the message could attract so many con men liars cheats and thieves i hate to even bring that up right but you see people have this idea that the message the pure word of god for this hour everything about it would be pure well the word itself is pure and the effect it has on the real believer is pure but you'll find that many people fit right in here with this they just see a group of people drawn together what can i get out of them i remember when i first started the pastor of the church side note here is it okay amen side note here i told myself i remember speaking to jerry if anybody ever comes in our church and starts peddling mlm i will preach at them from the pulpit and i don't like to approach things that direct right i don't but you know what i've seen this before you see one it's like oh brother trevor assistant carrie only five hundred dollars to sign up and in a few months you'll have 50 people under you and be getting checks for seven or eight thousand dollars thank you for the 500 thank you for the 500 thank you for the 500. in a few months these people are so discouraged they just give up because nothing what nobody's interested how did i get into this how did i get conned into this thing you see my brother and sister that's not what the house of gods for amen that's not what the body of believers is for and it's not for us to come and uh have a negative impact on other in fact the word shows us that we should go out of our way to lift up our brothers and sisters how oft shall my brother sin against me and i forgive him tell seven times lord with that i mean would that be reasonable some of you already ran out no seven times no jesus said unto him i say not unto thee until seven times but until seventy times 7 that is an incredible amount of forgiveness that's an incredible amount of mercy that is not god giving to us because we can't measure his mercy this is our mercy between us isn't that incredible you imagine now somebody's gonna have to really work at it to offend you 490 times in one day that's something's really malfunctioning here right even in the worst of whatever it might be so you look at this therefore is the kingdom of heaven lacking to a certain king which could take account of his servants and when he had begun to reckon one was brought unto him which owed him ten thousand talents but as for much as he had not to pay his lord commanded him to be sold and his wife and his children and all that he had and payment to be made my brother and sister this is this this is a supreme sacrifice this man has for a debt his wife and his children himself all just probably being split up sent down the road to bring a price to pay a debt hmm the servant therefore fell down and worship him saying lord have patience with me i will pay thee all then the lord of that servant was moved with compassion and loosed him and forgave him and it's done clean finished oh my but the same servant couldn't just couldn't get over that the mercy that had been shown to him he could not pass it on imagine somebody being so bold to come and say please forgive me for something but i'm not going to forgive the you servant went out and found one of his fellow servants which owed him a hundred pence and laid hands on him and took him by the throat saying pay me the thou owest my this is pretty rough guy huh and his fellow servant fell down at his feet be uh they sought him saying have patience with me and i will pay thee all right same word should have echoed back in and he would not but wouldn't cast him into prison till he should pay the debt so when his fellow servants saw what was done they were very sorry and came and told them to their lord all that was done then his lord after that he called him said unto him o thou wicked servant he didn't even say misguided or you didn't have a revelation of this he says he's wicked i forgave thee all that debt and because thou desired me should us not thou also have compassion on thy fellow servant even as i had pity on thee and his lord was wrong delivered him to the tormentors till he should pay all that was due unto him so likewise shall my heavenly father do also unto you if you from your hearts forgive not everyone his brother their trespasses that's pretty that's pretty abrupt right i mean i don't think we need a revelation we don't need to go get the theosaurus and the dictionary and all of the lexicons to go back and study this to understand what was just spoken talking to the young people you know do unto others as you want done unto you as our old paraphrase of the scripture you want forgiveness you want friends you want all of this we do that adults are we listening amen let's just put it a little stronger every brother and this sister what in this church whether you feel like they are devoted 100 or not you ought to look at them with compassion and prayer and lift them up and call them brother and call them sister not judging whether they're worthy or not of our approval so you look at this this sweeping rain it's a rain that only gets things wet never soaks in for sustaining life gone in a very short time now i want to say saints when we come and we do something for someone when we help or we bless someone with something if it does not come from our heart where is it coming from do we have an agenda do we have a motive do we have a purpose if it does not come from our heart we need to question why we're doing this but i'll tell you this my brother and sister whether you not them you are rich or poor if you do this from the heart you love them from the heart you pray from them from the heart you help them maybe financially something lord lays on your heart whatever it might be just sometimes a a arm around the shoulder a hug saying god bless you we love you so whatever it is you do that whether you are rich or poor you do that and be a blessing to someone and god said i'll open the windows of heaven and pour blessings out upon you you see it's all about the intent or the purpose of our heart why we do this you see if we do it for the wrong motive we may as well not do it we do it for the right motive god said i will fill your house full of treasure now he didn't say gold he didn't say silver he didn't say stocks and bonds in real estate he said treasure now treasure might be a godly wife or a godly husband children serving the lord might be the car that never breaks down it might be the tires that go a hundred thousand miles might be a refrigerator that you look at and say my we've had that thing for 25 years it might be a washer or dryer that you got for when you got married and now you've got four kids in the years have went by and it still works see god pours his blessings out in various ways i knew a brother once drove a station wagon i don't remember now the miles but incredible amount of miles and he actually pointed it out to me and says brother paul them tires have been on there for over a hundred thousand miles now i'm telling you my brother and sister that's god putting treasure in your house are we okay amen they that forsake the law praise the wicked now i'm gonna speak you know these are words that come to me while i was studying and and they're gonna be a little bit direct and please forgive me i i wouldn't offend any one of you for no reason but my brother and sister they that first take the law praise the wicked now i tell you what come to me as i was studying this you see my brother and sister many times let's talk about the realm of this message we don't got to worry about all the rest of this garbage out here it is what it is and you ain't going to change it but around the message we tend to allow people to bring in ideas and make statements concerning the message that do not line up with the word of god and everybody is like oh that's a good brother he's just doesn't understand look there's only two spirits in the framework of the church so let's not be praising someone who is then putting a twist on the word of god don't be trying to lift that up because what you do is you send a mixed message where people go well they believe this over here but i guess that's all right no my brother and sister we believe the word of god for the hour we don't need to put a twist or a spin it don't need to have a sinker it's not a spitball amen it needs to just come straight out of the word straight to you and i and so let's not praise the wicked let's not praise that right because the prophet of god said this when you come up to a place where you are opposed to the word of god any bit of the scripture i'm just paraphrasing this any bit of the scripture you're opposed to that that is an antichrist spirit this is not my brother and sister differences of opinion it is not me interpreting they interpreting brother branham preached it god interprets his own word amen so don't be given praise to these people that are then causing people to get all twisted up in what they are taught and what they believe and how it is and then you come and then people are like but but everybody speaks so highly of this guy and well he's got a great sinker ball no come on let's face it saints we need to come as a message and start just standing up and saying you know what i i this doesn't line up with a word and i can't support that we don't have to speak ill in fact i can give you quotes where brother brown says you don't speak ill of them you don't criticize them you pray for them amen but you don't you are are we on the same page you you aren't going to criticize them and that's a human fault that we many times have that we are going to lift them up and pray for them but we don't go over here and then talk about what a wonderful spiritual guy this is that has something that won't line up with the word you see what i'm saying and so we got to be real careful while we aren't going to criticize the individual that we don't promote yes that's right it's a tough position sometimes it it it causes a i'll tell you what it'll do sometimes it'll take grown men and grown women and make them so nervous they'll just break out cold sweat because these are people they know these are people they love you know these are people maybe even in their church or you know i remember one brother i i definitely want to hint where this come from but you know it it was right there his own father-in-law that he he grew up under and and whatever and one day he had to just say look uh i can you show me where brother brown said this his own father-in-law said how dare you question me see that wasn't the right answer that's that's not defending what he should be able to as a minister defend but i like the second half of this i don't want to focus on that too much but they that seek the lord understand all things now in this wonderful my brother and sister the scripture says that you can't even call him the christ without the holy ghost so look how god works he comes right down here and he puts something inside of you and i and we start seeking him lord i want to know you i want to know you in truth i want to know you in spirit i want to know you lord yes and then sometimes they don't even realize it we start getting the revelation of understanding and we start to see in the word and it starts to come alive to us and the more it comes alive to us the more of this word we understand and then it just starts to grow starts to grow starts to grow and pretty soon it is a full-fledged revelation not a man revelation but a revealing of jesus christ oh hallelujah it makes me so excited we're not just message people god sent a prophet saints we've had the very mystery of jesus christ open to us in this day it is alive and it is well amen the seals have been broken and god has given us understanding i see ears to hear the word is coming into full blossom full maturity right before us oh hallelujah hallelujah oh my oh my now look as we just keep moving along here better is the poor that walketh in his uprightness then he that is perverse in his ways though he be rich i think that's pretty self-explanatory actually but you know i just wanted to kind of bring a little light you know now i don't know all of us are a little different i'm a person our house reflects it when i work it reflects it i'm a person that likes light in the natural yes sir people sit over there and they'll read a book and i what are you doing in the dark it's not dark in here yes it is in my world it's dark in here okay we need to put more lights in this room we're remodeling this house we're putting more lights there's so many lights in this room that the room glows that's good it's just about right that's just me in the natural the way of a true prophet brother branham i always encourage you saints i cherry-pick these things out most people won't stand in the pulpit and tell you i've just cherry-picked this quote but the truth of it is if we didn't we'd have to read the whole book to you so that you could find the true understanding of the whole thing and then we wouldn't hardly get anywhere because we would be reading page and page and quote quote quote quote so you go home and you look before it and you look after it but i just love this quote and i said the other night it seems to be today that the whole church is built upon the main thing amongst the brethren today of the churches is numbers numbers one trying to outdo the other one numbers god don't count numbers he counts character can someone say thank you lord character is what god's looking to find somebody he can get his hands on now some of us my brother and sister might be a little overzealous on this but as i shared sunday we'll go into the mercy seat and we'll start dealing with this because some people kind of feel like if god's right here in our midst tonight that he must be off the mercy seat but i'm sorry i serve an omniscient omnipresent god amen i serve a god that the word opened in our day shows very clearly that he is here now look this is where people stumble it's not just in the holy spirit that the spirit is upon us but you see the word of god is god himself and the prophet over and over and over again refers to the word in you does anybody give me the conclusion of what that means god's in you god wasn't looking to just anoint you in the flesh god was looking for a place to have a life manifested in this day so there is a group of believers that are manifesting the word of god that is the very life of god walking on earth today not just an anointing on the flesh of the holy spirit but the scripture says christ in you hallelujah so we become that vessel we become the hands we become the feet we become the voice we become the example and we reflect that because god's looking to find somebody he can get his hands on somebody they'll stand still long enough okay are we good so we're not really looking for numbers you know my brother and sister i was talking to a brother sometime back i made a little comment i said brother i hear your church is growing and there's silence silence sometimes can be deafening and he makes a little comment with a chuckle behind it not all growth is good growth and no i'm not explaining that okay i'll pray for you good we need it so look my brother and sister what god's looking for if we come well look at it this way you remember reading the quote where brother brown says something's wrong when the mayor of the city starts to come to your church so that's the mayor and we can do that but sometimes there's people who think they're the mayor there's people who are anointed act like they're the mayor there's people that want to express their opinion whether it's ask for or not and when they come that doesn't always mean well doesn't mean we're blessed it might be that they bring their money believing that's going to change the church to be what they want the church to be but i tell you my brother and sister just as it was remember in the scripture i i'm i'm i wasn't going to say anything about it i really shouldn't but i come to church tonight with a migraine and i i seriously thought about playing a tape i thought i have all weekends chris it's gone brother david's gone and here i am or midweek and i've got a migraine and and uh well i'll just fast i i had an instant migraine today when i backed a chopper into the back end of a semi trailer and bent it up i had an instant migraine amazing how that works isn't it so you know you look at this and you think oh my oh my what what is what well look my brother and sister what god's doing here is he's trying to show us the only thing that matters rather have this little handful of real believers than a great big church and a great big program of unbelievers and make believers we don't want to count numbers let's count character let's count character let's have courage enough to say lord mold my character right that's kind of like praying for patience it's hard more my character lord well the lord says fine i'll mold your character i'll let you run into things and i'll let you do this and i'll let you do that and i'll let this happen i'll let that happen because i'm gonna mold your character i'm gonna let this sister say something to you and you're gonna go home and go oh my goodness i i think she just called me or said i was like this and oh lord i thought she was my friend and this brother he's this and oh he says and he done this and oh lord i feel insulted and what am i gonna do and then we pick up our message and we're reading and the prophet of god says you choose to be offended huh yes you choose to be offended well if not the devil would just throw the spirit of being a thief on you and you wouldn't be able to help yourself you'd walk out of here tonight and you'd go to a walmart kmart this martin that martin you just start packing stuff out cause you no no it's a decision so is character lord mold me mold me into your i want to be your character now let's close with this right here because you see somebody's got to stand still let the word of god move now i like this right here closing sister emmy would you come i hope we can say amen to this tonight your character is god's character what is it a little pushover saints now don't think i'm complaining but i want to give an example i've had people tell me the prophet of god said not to argue over the word and you're arguing no actually i i wasn't arguing because if you think i was arguing you don't really know me because i get pretty intense when i argue i'm not proud of that but if we're going to step over in that realm i can get pretty intense but you see my brother and sister i'm not a pushover the older i get the less of a pushover i am no sir if god is a god of judgment he is a god of correct it must be on the line nothing else will do that's the kind of character you are because you're the character of your father see see that's why we as a church aren't going to compromise to grow we're not going to compromise to accomplish this or compromise to accomplish that or compromise to be known you see my brother and sister because when it really comes down to it when it really really really comes down to it we that's why we should highlight things [Music] well maybe i no here we are there we are going back to verse four well you don't have to put it on screen they that forsake the law praise the wicked but such as keep the law contend with them contend is to take position in an argument you see saints we weren't called to give falsehoods free reign we were called to stand sure upon the word of god and to declare it that's one of the reasons they didn't like brother brown's ministry because he took this spirit of denomination and he took it right back he didn't call the people he didn't say you're a devil you're a devil you're a devil in fact jesus was much more blunt when he spoke to them and said ye of your father the devil but brother branham they were angry with him because there he was he took the spirit or where the nomination come from and he took it right back and showed them where that seed sprouted now do you understand what's happening in the day we live in god's called you and i not to give free reign to these things but to stand and say we know where the spirit of that came from now people say that's you're you're angry you're bitter you're this no saints we're not we're not we either stand on the word of god or we compromise it's that simple and so what is this god brings life lessons to us you wonder why sometimes you find yourself caught up in a little turmoil and you wonder lord why or how did this happen you realize there's always a lesson in that stop don't look at the trial itself my brother and sister don't look at the trial i'm just going to use a silly example the wheels fall off the wagon oh lord why did the wheels fall off the wagon why don't you stop and say lord there's got to be a reason the wheels fell off the wagon maybe i need patience maybe i need to learn to pray maybe someone will come along and god will anoint them to help you that they might receive a blessing for helping the bride of christ don't stop and say lord you don't love me today lord you know why why why oh i know what it is i know what it is this little catholic spirit on me about 10 weeks ago i kind of went and now the lord's punishing me for that seriously it's not about the trial it's about what you do in the midst of the trial that's what's god's doing molding character hallelujah now that doesn't mean that when the wheels fall off the wagon you don't stop and go oh my lord not again let you say lord what is it speak to me lord show me let this be a life lesson to me because i am the bride of christ and come on let's can we speak confident can we quit beating around the bush about who we are and what believe and what the prophet of god showed us we should do my brother and sister will stand up and say i am the bride of christ and whatever happens to me god had to grant it the devil does not have free reign and i will stand here and i might in my flesh say lord why is it why did this happen why did that happen why did the motor blow up why did the wheel fall off but i know my god is in control and i know i'm the bride of jesus christ and i can speak to him and he will come on my behalf that's the kind of confidence this word should be producing in us not wishy-washy not cry babies not wannabes we are the bride of jesus christ hallelujah you believe that stand up let's sing a song or two but i don't have a single song to sing so brother jason's gonna come and bail brother paul out amen that's what he always tells me brother paul that's what i'm here for when you need me i'll be there brother paul hallelujah brother jason i believed you tonight hallelujah but i do have one song as we brother jason does come oh don't laugh at me saints i believe god amen i love you saints god bless you each and every one hallelujah hallelujah [Music] i believe god somebody flattened to be asks what you
