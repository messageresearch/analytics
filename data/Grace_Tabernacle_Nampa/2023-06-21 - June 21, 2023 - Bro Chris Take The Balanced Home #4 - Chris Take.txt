heart but it's been hectic long day of work and I'm apologize for being a bad example and showing up past 7 30. but I had a few things I just had to get written down and so um then we came out and we didn't have batteries for the microphone so but uh you know the devil knows he he's lost he's just too uh stubborn to give up and we know we've won and we have too much faith in God to give up amen let's start this here so I wanted to take tonight um a continue on the balanced home uh this is part four and um if you have your Bibles turn with me to Ephesians chapter 6 verse 1. you know I've been um trying to keep keep open to the Lord's leadership you know give you give yourself a title like the balanced home I could just go any direction the Lord wants and not confined to a box and last time we talked on kind of Economics of the home and you know each one of these topics that we go through we might come back and do some more on them however the Lord leads us and I appreciate your your patience and and your attentiveness you know um I don't know it all um I'm I'm ministering it as the Lord shows it to me so it's it's fresh fresh from our lives and we're living this and and so if there's anything that comes up and you say well that I don't know if that sounds just right or what please let's have a conversation because you know what I have a lot to learn Ephesians chapter 6 verse 1. the children obey your parents and the Lord for this is right honor thy father and mother which is the first commandment with promise that it may be well with thee and thou mayest live long on the Earth some would do well to read this scripture instead of paying thousands of dollars for Botox and faceless and your fathers provoke not your children to wrath but bring them up in the nurture and admonition of the Lord now we could we could stop there do I still have the mic we could stop there um and we can say okay let's let's talk about let's talk about the children and obedience but as I was studying I I read on it says servants be obedient to them that are your Masters according to the flesh with fear and trembling in singleness of your heart as unto Christ in in this chapter and the chapter before Paul always says as unto Christ be submitted to Christ it's all about Christ okay verse six not with eye Service as men Pleasers but as the Servants of Christ doing the will of God from the heart so you're serving God because you love God with Goodwill doing as doing Service as to the Lord and not to men knowing that whatsoever good thing any men doeth the same shall he receive of the Lord whether he be Bond or free and your Masters do the same things unto them for bearing threatening knowing that your master also is in heaven neither is their respect of persons with him may the Lord blessed reading of the word you can be seated tonight so I know it's Wednesday night and everyone's fresh back from camp and back to work and probably still recovering so I'll try to keep this within an hour um Lord willing so I'm beginning to think about I was thinking about okay well feeling led to talk about um the direction of chapter six which goes over the children and obeying your parents and everything in which is the complete the complete picture of a balanced home and and I as I read this chapter I realized there was one there was one um foundational that um actually goes through I can switch to a handheld if I need to actually goes to um through the entire Bible and that is obedience and you start with the parents you know children obey your parents and honor their father and thy mother and then it and then it says servants be obedient to them now we can take that to today and say well we'll be obedient at work and and uh whoever whoever we are serving underneath because we're all Servants of the Lord so we all have a master now we all have the our our Master which is Christ we all have Masters lowercase M here on Earth all of us answer to somebody and you know whether it be the the government with your taxes or different things like that but we all we all answer to the law we always we always have a mess or where where are we going and um we may not all be husbands and we may not all be wives we might not all be fathers or mothers but we were all children every single one of us has a father and a mother even if they're not living today you are still their son or their daughter so we're all children so when we read the chapter that verse 6 honored thy father and thy mother obey your parents that applies even to me that applies to Brother David that applies to brother sister Joy because you do honor unto your father you and we can transfer that into to Christ we can we honor Christ Our Father but I mean but look at this one principle that goes through the scriptures on obedience and um in a first Samuel chapter 15 very familiar part of scripture and think I think whenever obedience comes up we kind of tend towards um this story but this is the story of Samuel or excuse me Saul and and the moment that he lost the Kingdom to David or the the Lord took the Kingdom from him uh first Samuel chapter 15 verse 10. says then the then came the word of the Lord unto Samuel saying it repenteth me that I have set up Saul to be king for he has turned back from following me and hath not performed my Commandments and it Grieves Samuel and he cried unto the Lord all night and when Samuel Rose early to meet Saul in the morning it was told Samuel saying Saul came to Carmel and behold he set him up a place and is gone about and passed on and gone down to gilgal and Samuel came to Saul and Saul said unto him blessed be thou of the Lord I have performed the Commandment of the Lord you know um Saul was guilty and he knew it and so one of the things there's a scuffle in the bedroom and you go in there okay kids what happened they know they're guilty so first off Saul says you know I did what I was supposed to do I I obeyed and Samuel says well what what why do I why then do I hear sheep and oxen cows why do I hear these and so I said well they have brought me from the amalekites the people spared the best of the sheep and of The Oxen to sacrifice unto the Lord thy God and the rest we have utterly destroyed then Samuel said unto Saul stay and I will tell thee what the Lord hath said to me this night and he said unto him say on and Samuel said when thou little in thine own sight was thou not made the head of the tribes of Israel and the Lord Anointed The King over Israel and the Lord sent me on a journey and said go and early destroy the Sinners the amalekites and fight against them until they be consumed wherefore then did US thou not obey the voice of the Lord but did his fly upon spoil unto this evil in the sight of the Lord and Saul said unto Samuel I have obeyed the voice of the Lord and have gone the way which the Lord sent me have utterly destroyed the amalekites so he for the sake of time will skip ahead he he reads it in his mind he said that I he reasoned away and he found a loop and he said well you know what um give me to switch he said you know what um we're gonna say that we're gonna save the sheep and we're gonna save the The Oxen We're Gonna Save the King and and he had this plan in place and Samuel says something that that's very profound in verse 23. verse 22 and Samuel said hath the Lord has great delight and burnt offerings and sacrifices as in obeying the voice of the Lord behold to obey is better than sacrifice and to hearken than the fat of Rams for Rebellion is as the sin of Witchcraft and stubbornness is as iniquity and idolatry because thou has rejected the word of the Lord he hath also rejected thee from being King so it's better to obey the word of God than to sacrifice so it's better to obey the word of God so God God has a has a basis for how we we should live our lives he has a foundation that he gives us the nuances and the details is different for every person but obedience to that the Lord prefers that then sacrifice so what so you know you could sacrifice say well I'm sacrificing you don't want to you don't want to sacrifice your family you say well well I gotta you know we have to go do this and and it could be something that you're saying well you know this is um this is this is part of the church this is part of of spreading the gospel this is part of Christianity but just because it is doesn't mean you're the ones to do it okay so then you do this and you sacrifice the time you should be with your family because and you're disobeying the word of God so just because you should doesn't just because you can doesn't mean you should that when God calls you to something he also causes calls your family and your wife God has called me in the season that we're in to travel and I have the support of my wife and my children but I do not sacrifice my children because I'm traveling to preach that's very specific example because this is what I'm living in but this can be applied to anything in your life just because it fellowship with the Believers is good but not at the expense of your family not at the sacrifice of your family unless it's what God has called to you specifically to do but just because it's fellowship with the Believers doesn't mean you give up your family now you have a job when you have to take care of your job and take care of your home this is the basis of serving God just because it's it has to do with with the church and it has to do with with with with with the kingdom of God right because he was going to sacrifice animals on the altar that's a good thing but it was not an obedience to the word of God so he he would say hey we're going to sacrifice we're gonna we're gonna do this worship which is part of serving God but it wasn't what God told them to do he was in disobedience so we they have to keep what a balance it's the balanced home right and so many times I've seen in in the circle that I grew up in the circle that I've been a part of I've seen people sacrifice their family sacrifice their job because there was meetings to go to and fellowship to be had but God says hey obedience to the word of God so now now God Can Say Hey I want you to go here I want you to do this and you do this but you do everything and with wisdom the wisdom of God so you don't want to you don't want to you to take your family hither and young you know brother the brother Paula Fontaine whether John and his wife forget his name but Brother Paul's parents you know God called brother John to travel and and sister and his wife they did homeschool on the road and the kids everyone just right there United with Mom Dad because God called them to do that so it was if he was being you know direct obedience to the word of God so God might call one family to do one thank God another family to do something else but both things have to do with the kingdom of God but one is not your calling one is their calling so obedience is better than sacrifice I hope that that kind of makes sense so we have to kind of look at obedience for a moment first by one man's Disobedience well we'll get to Disobedience first but by one man's Disobedience many were made Sinners so by The Obedience of one shall many be made righteous so look at the power of obedience because Christ had the Christ was Jesus was given the choice he said you know let this cup pass to me nevertheless not my will but thy will be done so he in obedience to the word obedience to his father we Roman righteous because he died on the cross he took that he took that step forward by obedience and by one man's disobedience Adam and Eve many were made sinners so look at so just this is a fundamental a foundation for the gospel for the word of God is based on obedience Romans 6 verse 16. he says it says no ye not Paul says no ye not that to whom you yield yourselves servants to obey his servants you are to whom you obey whether of sin unto death or of obedience unto righteousness so when you when you disobey Christ you obey the devil and when you disobey the devil you obey Christ so there's types of obedience there's there's two types of obedience there are two types of servants servants to evil servants to good we don't we are not our we can't be you know the world says hey I'm My Own man you know do whatever whatever I want to well you're going to either follow Christ or the devil now you think well I thought this was about family well the family of God is the best example that I can think of and when you begin to look you begin to see how God treats the family how God structures the family of God there's great insight into our own families and uh though he were a son yet learned he obedience by the things which he suffered so we have two types of obedience obedience unto death obedience unto righteousness two types of servants Servants of good or Servants of evil now we always have we always carry the flesh man around with us the flesh man is a servant of evil but our obedience to the word of God brings which we have that scripture later on the Corinthians brings the flesh into subject to the word of God so we always have to war with disobedience now why do we have the flesh disobedience Adam and Eve disobeyed the word of God so we became imperfect and we needed Christ to redeem us so we could keep our home in obedience to the word of God so we keep our home our family our wife our children in obedience to the word of God so in the home just like Christ by his obedience he made many rights just like as the father of the home your obedience to Christ puts the token in your home shrouds your family in righteousness just like in in in the um during The Exodus the fathers you know they took the blood they put it on the doorpost by their obedience those of the household were made righteous because the blood the death angel passed them by so obedience with this scripture we could we could say oh well you know well we suffer and we learn obedience but we'll leave that for another sermon another time what I wanted to focus on is that obedience is something that has to be learned or taught you know one of the one of the things that's Paramount in my in my study right now is is how to answer modern culture and I think it might even come into the series of balanced home but young people raising up and even some um um adults even how do you answer modern culture how when your kids come to you say well what's wrong with being kind what's wrong with being tolerant what's wrong with being inclusive because these are all we're being nice and doesn't the Bible say doing to others as you'd have been doing to you be nice and we could just say well the words it's not against the word of God we don't accept them and uh as in their sin and everything and but you say well what about the love of God so it it's I think sometimes we we want to just shut down a question like that and just say oh well it's easy it's against the word of God but why you got you have to you have to break things down for for kids for your children kids is relevant I just mean living at home with Mom and Dad still and so so say well well um I remember I was going with that oh that's where I was going the world says oh well we all have goodness in us actually the Bible says you're born a heathen you're born with desires to tear the world apart so actually unless you have Christ there is no goodness within you one of the fundamental things of modern culture is well we all have somewhere inside of us there's good in everybody that's not true that's not true it's Christ that brings that goodness now they might have some behaviors that might a nice gesture but eat down inside everyone there is not goodness because that's contrary to the word of God another thing and I know this because I have to take courses at work on how to be like this and uh so they say well there's the Platinum rule because it's gold and then Platinum right Platinum is better than gold the Bible the Bible doesn't call it the Golden Rule but that's how it's been known doing to others as you had been doing to you that's the Golden Rule that's how the Bible defines being kind but the world says there's a platinum rule do unto others as they would want you to do to them they call that the Platinum rule which is just amazing because they say well we our rule our rule is better than God's but what that means is then if they want to be you know if they want to act out inappropriately we should let them because that's what they want to do so not to go all the way into that but to Simply make the statement that obedience in your children has to be taught you know this is the biggest thing that I have to learn with my children as I sometimes they do things and I'm thinking what in the world why would you do that and then it's okay I've never taught them otherwise so if your kids grow up and they get to be teenagers which mine are not yet they will be very shortly because just a few years is like a few minutes now huh you if you don't teach your children modesty if you don't teach your boys how to to to to to take care of of a of a lady teach them to be gentlemen they will not just grow up to be gentlemen you have to teach them that you have to teach young girls and young boys that they don't go off alone together that that that that they stay honorable you have to teach them that they don't just get that and guess what they don't just get that in church you have to teach that at home because remember obedience is the very fundamental anything bring bring me anything in the word of God and it all goes back to obedience it all goes back goes back to obedience so we'll start with we'll look at Disobedience and then we'll finish off with obedience children of Disobedience Disobedience this is in the god of the Civil age Disobedience means rebellion and look that up in the dictionary to be sure Rebellion rebelling against what the revealed word of God so disobedience is rebellion and Rebellion at its foundation is going against the word of God doesn't matter what it is when you disobey your parents you're rebelling against the word of God so when people in society disobey or Rebel it's the word against the word of God you know what you cannot separate morals from the word of God so when you teach when you teach your children you say um you know Jackson you can't hit Abe why well at some point you just when they're real little you say because you know dad said so but at some point you have to begin to teach them the moral reason the foundation why Titus how come you don't get your gun and shoot the windows out of the church because we'll beat you up or we'll we'll get upset with you no because in your heart this is the house of God and God says to respect the house of God why don't we sit at the Pew in church and chew gum because Dad said so no because you're respecting the house of God because you love God if we if you raise your children up to the age where they can leave and go do what they want and all the rules they obeyed simply because if they didn't they would get in trouble when they leave your house they will do all of those things because there is not a moral compass so the word of God is our moral compass so the other so Jackson can't hit a because the Bible says do unto others as you would have them do unto you you don't have to get complicated especially when they're Jackson's age you don't have to get complicated you'll lose them real quick a 30-minute dissertation on the word of God you're going to lose them in two minutes but as they grow up as they grow up you begin to you have to explain these things and whenever you explain a reason why as they grow you say the reason why is because the Bible says this this is why dad why don't you know why can't I cut my hair if it's just because Dad said so and and the thing of it is is that you have to have the relationship with your children that allow for that discussion so if you're too if you're a dictator and you're controlling of your children they will never ask you why can't I do this they're too afraid to so there has to be Trust it has to be trust so you say well the reason why is because of the scripture now as they grow up you see them begin because the word of God is a special thing and as someone begins to take hold of it and begin to apply it in their life even that even as a six seven year old five-year-old they begin to apply it to their life they say well Jesus doesn't want me to do this so I'm not going to it begins to grow and it compounds and then they begin to treat others around them with respect and do things you never even told them to do but they begin to understand how God wants them to live and it it compounds it's like compounding interest so you invest you invest at a young age you want your children to Res to to have a to understand how important it is to go to church take them to church snow rain ice fog the church doors are open and you're here your children will go up and go to church if you want your children to pay tithes you pay tithes if you want your children to respect devotions you do there was this there was this man and he made this statement he was a great I think he was a congressman or a senator I can't remember which state it was but a great man had done great things and he said the the fundamental thing that has given me my success in life was my father said do as I do not as I say what a responsibility because that's what Jesus did he lives at everything he preaches so they rebel against the revealed word of God like Cain rebelled against Abel's revealed Revelation you know brother Stephen mentioned Cain and Abel and all them that was the first family that was the first example we had and you see you see in in that in that right away right at the beginning of the world Rebellion now Cain rebelled against it and slew his brother the Pharisees with their own denominational knowledge of what the word of God was selected hand-picked men rebelled against the Vindicated word of God made manifest for the day Jesus Christ and killed him that's that right that's what the children of disobedience is a rebellion against the word of God now because of the Fall In the Garden of Eden children are born rebellious you have to teach them obedience and we could we look at this quote because it breaks down the problem in the family of God Disobedience to God's word the children of Disobedience so in the church in the in the in the in the church you have issues with churches themselves because there's Disobedience to the word of God it takes all the word for success in your life now you you none of us know all the word but we live all the word we know okay so as long as your desire is God show me more of your word so I can live more of your word you will always live all the word but to deny a portion of the word is to be a children of Disobedience and rebel against the word of God now this this we can go another we could go this direction and talk about the church and the message and different things but we're talking about the family so we'll take that example from the family of God and move it now into our homes where if we don't apply all the word we will find rebellion in our children but applying all the word to your family causes many to be righteous puts the token in your home you know the token comes to you the token comes to you and you because you by living the word of God so you live God live all the word in obedience to the word you want you want your family your children to obey you obey God you want your wife to to to to be uh your your helper and your and your and your companion and to Bear the burden with you you obey God and when you obey God you see back in the old days with the message obey God a pilot token was people were interpreting that as take the TV outside and shoot it with a shotgun throw your wife's Immortal clothes out the window throwers high heels out the window say we're applying but that's not it but for those households that just the husband just begin to live the word of God and live in obedience to the word of God what happened the house began to change because the atmosphere changed when you're in obedience to the word of God the atmosphere that you create in your home brings your home in line with the word of God now we we brought this scripture up um in the beginning Rebellion is the sin of Witchcraft so Disobedience this rebellion and Rebellion is as the sin of Witchcraft witchcraft could take that many different rays but it's Antichrist and in Christ's spirit so stubbornness is as iniquity and idolatry now you can be determined but stubbornness is the resistance to change resistance to change so you're you're refusing to surrender to the word of God what's the the big thing in modern culture today I think that's gonna I think we're gonna do that one coming up but the big thing in modern culture is oh yes stand for your rights rebel against the you know the rebel against well what's what what it is in the world be stubborn you starting you're starting to see that in the message the message culture stand with it you know well don't stand with it unless it's the word of God okay so disobedience is rebellion now I brought the scripture in here because it says o foolish Galatians this is in Galatians 3 1 who hath Bewitched you that ye should not obey the truth before whose eye Jesus Christ hath been evidently set forth crucified among you now Rebellion is as the sin of Witchcraft and Paul could use any word he wanted to use here but he uses the word Bewitched so you see the Galatians and the church begin to disobey the word of God because Disobedience to the word of God is is saying well well we'll take this part and leave this part out now you can be disobedient to all of it or a portion of it either way you're still disobedient to the word of God because it's all the word okay so the full the foolish Galatians begin to mix their the message of their hour with doctrines of men and bewitched the people through Rebellion which is Disobedience to God's word so you see you see problems begin to form in your children I'm not talking about little things like kids do I'm talking about habitual problems in your family of rebellion are you applying the whole word of God to your life are you applying all the word are you in obedience to Christ so because they they left The Obedience of the word of God the people were Bewitched Rebellion came into their midst and caused them all kinds of problems so when you have the word of God it's either all the word or it's nothing to deny one part is to deny the whole the problem with this is is I see people who pre who who who who profess who live this but you see little things in their homes little things in their lives that they refuse to change and the problem is what happens where I didn't expect this to come out so straight tonight the problem is however you whenever you begin to depart from Lord whenever you begin to depart from humility you fail to look at the word of God as a mirror you know you know the word of God can it's um your vision of the word of God can cause your mirror to fall you ever taken a taking a shower you get out can't see the mirror it's all fogged up you see the word of God is always the word of God but it's your vision that can fog up and whenever you depart from humility and pride takes over you fail you're looking at the word of God as a fogged mirror she said oh I kinda I kind of see myself yeah I'm a Christian yes I'm a Christian but things come in see the problem is not the problem is not mistakes the problem is not uh failures the problem is the losing the desire to grow and losing the inability to look at your own humanity and say God I need your grace we all have to grow always and whenever you serve God in that way of God show me what I'm show me what I'm doing wrong so that I can allow you to fix it guess what you will always grow and little things won't submit as long as you apply the word to your home and to your family little things won't slip in and when they do sometimes they do but when they do God shows you and you say okay and you go on you and you deal with it so here's the thing about Disobedience now we all want to be connected to Christ we'll have the desire to be one with God but when when we begin to to say well I'm not gonna I'm going to now here's here's the here's the thing I I just I struggle to put this correctly so the Lord just gonna have to say it to your heart this isn't blatant disobedience this is reason nobody sets out to blatantly no Christian sets out to sublately disobey God they just begin to to to spend less time with him and the world the world what is the world like a flood you ever seen you ever seen and in person or on a film when when there's rain torrential rain in the mountains and all of a sudden all the washes in the desert just boom they're a raging River that's the enemy and if you don't if you don't if you don't have the cross if you don't have Christ keeping the flood back it get it's it's always a flood okay so so you say well in Little Things little disobediences come in slowly over time you see something begins to push you from God now concrete walls are very sound resistant so as you as you say well I don't want that part and and now subconsciously you're still coming to church you're still serving God but little things here slipped in here slipping uh it was it was only clean movies and it was a few words here and then it was a few more words and and then it was well we'll just fast forward that part and and and and and the lord the devil just creeps in Brick by Brick by Brick till you're in a position where you have no connection with Christ you're going to church do you have no connection with Christ a wall has been built up slowly Brick by Brick because of your Disobedience to the word of God so now you're separated from Christ the cool thing is God has a giant sledgehammer and he can come and he can he can bring that wall right back down through the word of God but you know what with every brick that builds up that's a brick that has to be taken down so we humans we we have layers so so we have we have complexes in our life that build up and offenses that come along that build up all of this the all of that this does is this just limits your contact with Christ each block is what a block of unbelief Disobedience to the word of God is just unbelief and unbelief is sin little things come in and and the next thing you know you you can't even see Christ one of the one of the fundamentalist things in the word of God is go to church and read your Bible yet you see Christians who who moved to places or go to places where there's no church or they stay somewhere there's no church or you see young people who don't read their Bible adults who don't read their Bible but they still go to church but you see a wall has been built up and if a wall has been built up in your life and you can't see Christ your home will never be balanced because you cannot find balance in the home outside of obedience to the word of God and how can you obey something you can't even see but you gotta have but see God is rich in Mercy and God comes along now I wanted to just look at the attributes of rebellion I know this is this is heavy right but we're gonna we're gonna get to the positive side I'm not gonna let you go home like this because you know what we are more than conquerors so a few a few attributes of rebellion I'm not saying these are all of them but some of the attributes of rebellion or idolatry contempt and lying now idolatry Exodus 20 verse 3 says Thou shalt have no other gods before me now what I said earlier is the best example of what to do what not to do is just look at the family of God in the scriptures what do they do you know what did David do why did Absalom just completely rebel against David because David disobeyed the word and took Bathsheba that's an extreme example right hopefully none of us have sons who are taking our homes over kicking us out but that's an extreme example so the word says Thou shalt have no other gods before me now disobedience is rebellion okay so in Nehemiah 9 verse 17 to 18 Nehemiah is is reiterating the history of Israel on their way to the promised land and they refused to obey neither were mindful of thy Wonders that thou didst among them but hardened their next and in their Rebellion appointed a captain to return to their bondage now what's up they're returned to their body who wants to go back to their bondage you see how the devil how the devil works it who wants to obey the word of God none of you are going to raise your hands disobey no no you want to disobey the word of God none of you're going to raise your hands none of the Egyptians wanted to go back to slavery but yet they raise the captain said take us back to Egypt what happened a disconnect a wall was built up they sat on the desert the desert for 40 days No Moses everything was quiet sometimes you sit in the desert of your life for 40 days no word from God what's going on see God wants to try our faith sometimes and um but thou art a God now here here's the thing you see this colon that's like that's a transition that's that that's the other side the paradigm shift says oh this is how the they were but God you are ready to pardon gracious you're merciful you're slow to anger you're of great kindness and you forsook them not what is the best example of a father or Heavenly Father yea when they had made them a molten cap excuse me and said this is thy God that brought thee up out of Egypt and had brought great provocations so they made themselves an image so you see they begin to rebel against God they say we're going to have a captain we're gonna go back we're gonna refuse to obey we're gonna go we're back to Egypt and the the the the you said we could look at it and say well well they built a golden calf and they rebelled no the golden calf was a byproduct of their Rebellion it was an attribute of their Rebellion idolatry now brother Stephen just put it beautifully when he brought about the Ark of the Covenant and how the children of Israel had made it idolatry and so if you're not careful in your hope you will make going to church an idol in your home you see well why why why you don't ever have conversations there's no you don't represent Christ to your family church becomes an idol and and and and I speak from experience having friends who whose families were like this none of them serve God none of the children serve God because church was an idol church was was hey we go and and and we do this because you know you want to go play you got to sit in your chair and read your Bible for 10 minutes that's that's Catholicism okay there never was the a heart there's always wherever you find God you find heart you find feeling emotion God is there you know we we say we don't trust God by his feelings and that is that is fundamentally true but she always you know he's there you have faith you know he's there there's heart if you want your children to love God you have to love them unconditionally because we're showing them an example of what a father should be yeah so they made the calf the idolatry was a byproduct of the Rebellion now another attribute of rebellion is contempt and and you see this in in in in especially in in um uh when someone when someone is rebellious they're an utter contempt they don't they could care less what you want what you ask them to do they want to do the opposite pick you know contempt of court right they're you're rebelling against Authority the judges The Authority in the courtroom representing the United States and you rebel against him you are what's called contempt of court so you the word of God comes and and you say you know what it but you see contempt is a byproduct of Disobedience to the word of God Saul look at the life of Saul after this moment with Samuel you had idolatry you had contempt trying to kill David trying to Slit calls calls his men to slay all the high Priests of the of the of God talk about rebellion to God he says well God then he says well God has left me yeah of course there was disobedience so content the scripture here when the wicked cometh then cometh also contempt and with with uh ignominy reproach and that's like oh open shame and and uh it's just shameful Behavior so the scripture here just to show uh contempt is of Disobedience the wicked wicked or disobedient uh lying um in in uh father the hour has come but the RAM says now he thought he had the spirit of God but it was a lying spirit because it was contrary to the word of God I remember remember what is disobedience it's rebelling against the word of God now if people say signs and wonders don't follow it's a lying Spirits contrary to the word though if the Bible says that people tells you the Holy Ghost ain't in this day the same as it was the other days it's a lying Spirit that's in false prophets they're telling you a lie it just okay all liberation of women and do all these other things and go out and act like the world it's a lying spirit it's not lined up with the word stay in the word right stay right there so so when you begin to disobey the word of God and find Disobedience to the word of God from that comes the lying spirit because because you're rebelling against the word of God and uh the Lord needed someone to cause Ahab to Rebel and go out and fight the battle anyway so he could die so to bring in the prophecy to pass so God didn't send down you know um what God chose to do was allow a lying spirit so Ahab was already in Rebellion to the word of God because he said well yeah there's one more but he never tells me what I want to hear so from that came this lying Spirit now now these are these are these are attributes of rebellion but you don't have to have a rebellious Spirit to to have problems with lying but you have you have all of these things then together now you you there's a problem you see whenever whenever there's there's a there's a problem in the home there's a problem with with your marriage or there's a problem with your children don't go after don't go after the surface find the cause if you got a weed in your in your yard you don't go out there and snip the leaves You Pull It by The Roots and and and pride and jealousy those things can come from bitterness lying flying it what does lying come from lying could come from somebody who was hurt so they have a deep wound that's never healed properly where somebody didn't treat them right or somebody laughed at them made fun of them so now Pride covers them with lies so we say well you can't be a liar you can't be a liar what maybe your behavior as a parent is causing them to be that way because if you're not loving your children unconditionally you are in Disobedience to the word of God because we are to love each other like Christ loved the church especially in the home as Christ gave himself for the church that's the duty of the husbands to love his wife in the same way so you see Rebellion you say a lying in your family are you treating them the way the word of God says or are you just applying rules to your home you got to put you got to put a heart you got to put feeling you got to put love into how you deal with them because the home is this now now let's lay this here the home is a sacred place and you're Duty bound to keep whatever like we heard it your duty bound to keep Sodom outside of the home but if you take that wickedness or that Sodom in front of your children you rip it up you break it up you throw it out you are doing it in love so you're being disobedient to the word of God you're going to cause your child to be rebellious you say you get that you know maybe it's a skirt that's not modest enough and you you come hard on them at that you're you're in no Disobedience of the word of God because you're not doing it through the love of Christ I can't get up here and preach to you in anger because you're not lining up with the word of God I have to get up here and show you the way show the error and do so in complete love when Jesus whipped them out of the temple the Bible he didn't do it he did it in love oh he was he was whipping them and he braided a whip and he did that but he was doing it in love he saw the sin and he saw you know what this is what they need to get the point across but it was in love and compassion I don't know how that's hard to do you have to be so then so then now in order for you to discipline your children and for you to raise them the way they should be that's you have us you have to live in a very special place in other words you have to live right next to Christ as close as possible because you will not be able to discipline in love unless you have the sweet softness of the holy spirit in your life and your home and if the holy if there's things in your home if Sodom is in your home the holy spirit will never feel welcome so then how can you discipline in love how can your home be lined up obedience to the word of God if Christ is not there you see it's it's not just you and okay I'm gonna serve God no now you gotta you gotta bring in you gotta bring it home you gotta bring that light into your home because if there's light guess what there's no Darkness so how do you deal with disobedience with obedience it's really that simple it it there's this quote right here there was a question asked and he says take exactly the best of that question was how do you change the summary of the questions take exactly the opposite if you're always wanting your way and that one little brat that wants to always have everything your way turn right back around and give everything you got the other way if you're selfish and you want to hold everything then start giving away what you got see just go the vice versa that's the way to overcome anything tell me what's left out of that word anything that's the way to overcome anything is an antidote do the opposite so if you if you find an Obe disobedience go the other way into obedience you see it's not about it's not about how do I how do I put this correctly it's not about well I need to I need to get rid of this problem no just do the opposite of it so don't put the focus you see you see a behavior in your your children and you don't you don't like it's not it's not good um find the root of that and begin to administer the opposite you know sometimes your children will lack act up simply because they're lacking the attention they need so say you say hey you need to straighten up knock it up now there's discipline for misbehavior there's disciplines but you wanna you know we're not there too we're not there to just discipline them to be good kids whether to show them the right way to go where they're to show them obedience so when you're when you're when you let's say you haven't you didn't you you missed breakfast busy morning you missed breakfast it's two o'clock in the afternoon you haven't had breakfast or lunch and you're hangry what good is it going to do for somebody to start yelling at you to straighten up knock it off no just go eat food and suddenly you're a sweet angel sometimes the antidote you have to look what's the root cause of this right now we're dealing with this with with my son he broke his collarbone and um I say well he you know he's acting up say what when's the last time you gave him some ibuprofen give it to him he's a sweet little angel again because he's in pain kids can't tell you my shoulder hurts that's why I'm grumpy so now there's misbehavior you correct that I'm not saying not to but what's the cause of it because we're trying to we're trying to mold them we we look at look how what a responsibility we have it's the gift that God has given us what a responsibility we have we want to raise them to be exactly how God wants them to be therefore we have to create an environment that puts pushes them pushes them to their absolute best you got a car and you wanted to perform to the max you're gonna do everything you're going to get better tires you're going to get you're going to get better you're gonna get the engine as best as you can get it you're gonna keep it oiled up and and you're gonna get the best brakes and you're gonna have the the best uh you know um air the most you need air to the engine you want it to be the biggest and the best right you're trying to put that car to the max that it can do well you that's the same with your children you invest and you invest and you invest so that they can be the best that they can be according to the word of God so sometimes our Focus gets off and we focus on correcting instead of instead we focus on correcting behavior on the defense instead of working the offense in our family what let me tell you this what good does the defense in a game of football do if the offense never scores a point it's the offense that wins the game it's the offense that that earns the points the defense assists the offense so if you're always on the defense and you're always making up for lost time and you're always you're just trying to to and you're just you're in this downward spiral of Defense you might be maintaining but you're never scoring points but it's significant to be on the offense take your wife out to dinner take your wife out on a date look when you got young kids I'm thinking from personal experience minimum once a week take take her out you don't have to go spend 75 or 120 it might be a four dollar Taco Tuesday at Del Taco but it's you and her alone now oh it's like but it's investing you say oh my wife she's just been acting up and now the the home and there's laundry everywhere and the dishes are dirty so what are you gonna do you're gonna say listen woman you need to do the dishes she's probably so strung out and stressed out because you have not invested anything in it's really hard again I'm speaking from experience it's really hard to emergency invest and put it this way you uh you own a commercial building and the sprinkler system isn't any good so you never invest in the sprinkler system and fix it and your billing catches on fire and it's burning to the ground you can't you you're gonna go fix the sprinkler system it's too late now you're calling a fire truck and now you have the new building it's expensive you got a problem with a leaky faucet so you neglect it and then it bursts in the middle of the night and now half your house is flooded it's expensive your wife your children are a leaking faucet and you don't quickly get on that and fix that and it explodes and you say well what will be will be no you missed your chance to offensively fix the problem to get in there while you had the time we all know we all know what we need to do what we need to do but we put it off you can't afford to put it off so when you're in obedience to the word of God you fix the leaky faucet naturally it's a byproduct it's it's by default because that's the spirit that's working inside of you because you're an obedience to the world you see you say wow Chris brother Chris I thought this was about the kids you're going to tell them how to obey I am you start obeying the word of God your kids will start obeying you you see it's not about control breeds Rebellion start going through history every Rebellion started with a dictator pretty much we rebelled from England because they started to be dictators we uh England rebelled you know the Scottish rebelled against whoever or the Ireland rebelled right because they started to control beyond what they sh right they went from being a king and a leader to control and a dictator it breeds Rebellion it's just that's a human principle so now I wanted to read this the rest of this passage here in Nehemiah you can turn if you want but it's Nehemiah 9 19. so he says they they made a golden a molten calf and said This is Our God you know read that scripture earlier talking about Disobedience but verse 19 it says he says this yet thou and thy manifold mercies forsookest them not in the wilderness the pillar of the cloud departed not from them by day to lead them in the way neither the pillar of Fire by night to show them light and the way wherein they should go so they were disobedient to God now he punished them he punished them but he gave them the choice first who's going to come stand with Moses even those that did wrong including Aaron came stood by Moses Aaron was the high priest he said well Aaron built the calf yes but God had mercy so you you say your children Disobedience you don't respond to disobedience in your family by shunning them and turning your back on them no you you come in you correct it however however that whatever that looks like for the situation every situation is a little bit different however it looks you know maybe it's okay I'm gonna take that toy for a few hours I'm gonna take that toy for a while depending on the age there's age-appropriate discipline but you correct the behavior but you're right there to say dad loves you you're discipline you pull them right in give them a big hug you don't you don't get to after them and they just walk away no you you show them hey I I'm with you I love you we're we're gonna figure this out together you're standing by look right in the middle of this third Disobedience God walks with them now you say well yeah but then they got to the promised land and they refused to obey the word of God and refuse to go into the promised land and his judgment was 40 years in the desert but guess what he did during that time verse 21. he's sustained them in the wilderness so that they lacked nothing their clothes waxed not old and their feet swelled not in their punishment God took care of them because at the end of the day we are always they were always God's children he punished them and sent them to Babylon and what did he do they all got rich they married they had communities they prospered even in their punishment God still took care of them so let's bring that home now mom and dad even in your discipline you know you make sure they know you love them and you're there to take care of them and you're disappointing them not because you don't like them not because you're mad at them don't ever tie your emotions to your correction your emotions need to be apart from that your children should never serve you because of your emotions you don't say now you do this because you you know you're going to make mom and dad feel good no never do that you do it because God says to do it that's your moral compass your parents emotions is not your moral compass otherwise you raise you raise children who are men Pleasers and they want to keep everybody happy so they'll do the wrong thing they'll they'll do something that's detrimental to their own health to their own family to make their boss happy no your parents your kids never listen to you to make you happy they listen to you because the Bible says obey mom and dad so when you correct them then you're you have to do a home man I got I got fingers point back at me all right I'm a passionate person my emotions and I have to sometimes I gotta say honey I need you to handle this one and I walk away otherwise my emotions are in my correction God corrects Us in his love his love is corrective his love is correct his love is corrective so again his love is corrected so if you're correcting outside of love you are in Disobedience to the word of God and what is disobedience Rebellion say yeah my kids I don't know they picked up an attitude at school or something hanging out with the wrong kids their rebellion and everything I say no you caused that thank you okay but even in that God took care of them he gave them Manna for their mouth and water for their thirst don't punish your children with food that's my opinion acts 5 29 then Peter and the other Apostles answered and said we ought to obey God rather than men now what is what is our subject the balanced home you do not have to obey your parents outside of the word of God you're still have to honor them but you don't have to obey them outside of the word of God now there's ways to handle this okay I have no I don't know no situation here in the Church of this so I'm just speaking maybe to somebody on the Internet or maybe a future situation but if you're if your dad says okay you're not allowed to go to church anymore you don't just say well I'll tell you what and you march out no you go to your pastor you say hey we have this problem pray with me on how to handle this because you're still have to honor your father and mother you have to show them that honor that's fundamental truth that's the Ten Commandments so when you apply the word of God to your your life you have to make sure you are doing it with unconditional love you have to make sure you're doing it according to the word of God so just to drop that in there and we are his Witnesses of these things and so is also the Holy Ghost now so this is the same sermon Peter's preaching to the Pharisees and the Sadducees and he's a couple verses later he says this so also is the Holy Ghost whom God hath given to them that obey him do you see our hope tonight you're seeing the how how foundational obedience is and it has to be taught and has to be learned so you you want to raise your children to understand obedience as Paramount in their relationship with Christ and that obedience to the word of God is what brings the Holy Ghost because the you know there's fundamental things God lays out repent people has the name of Jesus Christ when you obey those things you're you're preparing the way for the Holy Ghost to come obedience to the word of God it brings us blessing now so that's how important to God obedience is to God wow it's already 9 15. I am sorry okay well we'll finish this up casting down imaginations and every High thing that exalted itself against the knowledge of God and bringing into captivity every thought to The Obedience of Christ so we have to bring ourselves to The Obedience of Christ we have to bring our thoughts captivity to The Obedience of Christ how by applying the word in our lives and in our families I knew this was going to be a big topic and um and when I get through all of it tonight and so we'll see what the Lord has in the store but I just want to hit on a couple of things right here and then we'll close faith is the foundation of obedience Trust you want your kids to obey you you got to have you have to build that trust so they know no matter what no matter what dad loves me because unconditional love is the foundation of faith while we were yet sinners Christ died for us he burst he birthed our faith within us by his unconditional love it's not what we did it's Who We Are you can never you can't I forget I might say this wrong forgive me I think you get the point you can never not be your father's child I think I said that wrong but whatever you get the point you can't do anything to take that away it's because of who he is and who you are and then you have faith in him because he loves you so obedience fruits of the spirit is a great place to start in closing here not long ago I was in the west heard of an Indian got converted said how you feel it chief after a few days he said well pretty good pretty bad said what do you mean pretty good said well once I well since I got saved it said there's two dogs in me said one's black one's white they just fight all the time so the black dog wants me to do bad and the good dog wants me to do or the white dog wants me to do good said which one wins Chief said depends on which one Chief feeds the most right that's what it comes down to you want obedience in your home the word of God needs to be in your home let's bow our heads Heavenly Father Lord Jesus thank you for your presence tonight Lord thank you for this this time lord it's um it's a lot it's a big responsibility father to to at some points as I've said time and again while preaching this series it it's it would seem impossible sometimes but you love The Impossible because if it's impossible and it happens then all the glory goes to you because with God nothing is impossible for you to help us Lord to take take these things Lord begin to apply them in our homes and help us because the devil's he's upset but Lord You're the one in control and if we yield to you if we yield to the right side of the equation and we feed the spirit with the word of God the spirit man with the word of God this word of God is going to Prevail against every situation in our home forgive us Lord for the times we corrected outside of love that we got our emotions all caught up Lord I believe you can redeem the time that we've lost to our mistakes and raising our children Lord help us father to be yielded and surrendered to you Lord Jesus to show them the the true example of what you are as a father thank you Lord Jesus we love you commit ourselves into your hands we just pray for our pastor if he's home not now I'm not sure but I know he had to go to Mountain Home and farm and just give him strength and then we ask and may you just carry us through the
