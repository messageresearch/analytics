Lord so glad that I'm your so glad your Mery has followed me so glad you found me and set me free oh Lord so glad I'm your you know that song actually is our Declaration of ownership amen we're declaring this is who I belong to and uh you know that's actually a very necessary thing we we have to clearly identify our position we see in the scripture uh remember Those portions of scripture concerning at the Jubilee time and the the post and the all and uh you know there were those that valued their security in the natural more than they desired their Liberty spiritually and they would allow their ear to be bored and what they were doing was declaring their ownership and uh we're here the Lord's given us ears to hear amen eyes to see we're declaring our leadership our ownership we're declaring Lord I hear your word and that word means more than anything else to me and that's where I belong amen God bless you brother vile good to see you amen amen let's just stand as we would go thank you brother Alex Amen brother Isaac and um sister Vanessa thank you so much um I want to speak to you tonight um on the thought taken from scripture that ye are able amen and um as we look at this 1 Corinthians the 10th chapter quite a lengthy scripture reading so we'll just break it off after a few verses here to kind of make a little bit of comment uh in that uh 1 Corinthians 10 1-4 to start with moreover Brethren I would not that you should be ignorant now if we stopped right there that right there could be a pretty large pretty large subject to preach on because God just doesn't want us to be ignorant to to now remember ignorant is not stupid ignorant is without knowledge so he doesn't want us to be without knowledge God wants you and I to have a knowledge of the Gospel the scripture of the life most of all amen that you should not be ignorant how that our fathers were under the cloud and all passed through the sea and were all baptized unto Moses in the cloud and in the sea and did all eat the same spiritual meat and did all drink the same spiritual drink for they drank of that spiritual rock that f followed them and that rock was Christ Heavenly Father we ask you to bless this service this evening for the needs of each and every one that is here and for those who are not here tonight father we just ask for your presence Lord strengthen us I pray in the name of Jesus Christ amen you may be seated now as we look at this it's it's interesting because this kind of actually has a parallel going back to Cain and Abel because Cain and Abel were both uh set at the same house under the same headship and one had Revelation and one had uh a knowledge but was not Revelation and so it starts off with the same spiritual or religious origin and um here's Christ right in their midst and some saw him and some didn't some left Egypt under law and even though it wasn't really preached in that day it wasn't really the aspect that was presented but some left Egypt under the law and some left Egypt under grace in other words under the blessing of God and so as we'll see how God is working he he is has the same patterns right brother brandham clarified that for us so we don't have to Jumble our thoughts around that God has patterns that he repeats and it's there that he the same yesterday today and forever so these patterns it it was once God's original thought it is still his original thought and so you think about how incredible that is because God's thoughts uh covered a generation that walked everywhere they went or maybe rode a donkey or a camel uh and uh that uh come all the way down to us in the age that we're in a jet and God's thoughts covered every drop of that he he looked at so it was there Christ right in their midst and um you know it's interesting how the gospel is because it is different from Individual to individual we have sit here tonight each one of us hearing the same uh message reading the same scripture and because of who we are and and nothing to be ashamed of there uh of who we are we we receive this differently we have a different teachings and sometimes we think what we think or believe what we believe because of good solid teaching sometimes it comes from incomplete teaching so if we have incomplete teaching that it is there that that will infect our thinking how we live our life how these things would be if you live under a Grace Grace type of a Ministry you know God understands God understands and God does understand but we don't want to take Grace into disgrace and so it's there that we have these different teachings complete or incomplete and uh we we receive things in a different fashion what I think is so beautiful is when God comes and he anoints the ministry to speak on something that he's already anointing the people in that very same pattern those same scriptures those same thoughts and that's what's really incredible because God is then showing that he is working on all sides of the equation it's not just a man standing here preaching his thoughts or what he thinks it should be for the moment but God moving and and then you'll find out many times that while that is going on maybe thousands of miles or even another continent they're preaching the same exact things and that's how wonderful our God is we have different desires now when I say different desires here my brother and sister I'm not talking about in this case right now desires of the flesh desires of leoda but we have different desires just as brother Isaac shared you know with sister St sitting there in the congregation she wanted that baby so bad that she decided that she needed to contribute her desire so strong that she started to put herself into that when as it comes back brother Brown you just need to believe what God said because God said it amen and here's the word I like that thank you brother Isaac because we have thus saith the Lord today my brother and sister and we we don't necessarily have to have a man in the land there's no not going to be another major prophet come and we don't need to look for that because everything that he spoke we have amen not even just in in the biblical sense but also in the message everything that was spoke it was there and you know you think about this I remember one time I was preaching in a place and I I I spoke on a certain subject and the brother afterwards wasn't really being critical but he he come and he says well well you preached on that and I figured out during during the service you know what he was doing uh I figured out during the service brother brandham never preached on that well I challenge you to go study the message and you'll realize just how small a portion of the Bible the prophet actually focused on there's so much of the Bible he never even touched because he gave you the key yeah to open it up amen so he didn't have to come open it and laid it on the table before us he gave us the scriptures gave us the Revelation gave us the key that we can unlock it and whether we unlock it or not is now our responsibility it won't fall back on anyone else won't fall back on the prophet so it's there we have different desires we have different expectations we come my brother and sister and realize that in the religious world today there there are those that come to church because that is their social life that is that is the the realm of their friend circle is in the church and you know they're there many times I I was reading a a little business article and this man's talking about how to he was an insurance agent Brother David and he was talking about how to expand your deal and he said church is a great place well that's why I go to church I want to I want to network with everybody I I want to do you know sounds like a recipe but not a very good one and so you know there's a lot of expectation on that and let me go back into the scripture cuz we don't want to be here too long tonight uh so he he's talking about that and he's saying look they were all in the same position baptized and they ate spiritual meat and they drank of the spiritual drink and so then it comes down that verse 5 says but with many of them God was not well pleased for they were overthrown in the wilderness so having all of that uh uh uh you know that they experienced there being baptized and eating the spiritual meat and the spiritual drink obviously did not keep them from being overthrown boy it sounds like today right amen America still claims to be predominantly America uh a Christian Nation but but there's not a lot of evidence of it many are there in the church overthrown as it were and um so you look at that they they started off good but they weren't well pleased for they were overthrown now these things were our examples see this is not just placed in scripture to to scare us or threaten us or or you know whatever but but it's here to give us an example that uh one we here we shouldn't intent should not lust after evil things as they losted neither be idolators now what's an idolator that's someone that has something between them and God so don't find and don't have anything or allow anything to come between you and God it is written the people sat down to eat and drink and Rose up to play that probably was at church neither let us commit fornication as some committed and fell in one day 3 and 20,000 neither let us tempt Christ as some of them also tempted and were destroyed of serpents neither murmur ye oh my brother and sister some of this we'd say I would never do not going to go out here and sin like that but murmur oh my we've almost got a PhD in murmur you see how slippery Satan is he come in that we we get this and we look at all what we think are so negative but he's got murmuring right here amongst these things things listed in the word that we should not do amen my some of them murmured and were destroyed of the Destroyer now all these things happened unto them for in samples or example and they were written for our admonition upon whom the ends of the world are come so this is not talking about a different generation it's upon us who the ends of the world has come it's talking speaking bringing this scripture right here right down today to you and I because this is the time this is the place and we need to Market that all of these Spirits have overtaken all of these Spirits are present we battle against every one of these Spirits oh no I'm a Christian I have no problem with that come on lying is also a sin so we find that we have these issues in this day but God said I'm going to give you an example that you can uh come and it's written for our admonition amen whom the end of the Earth you might say is Upon Our shoulders yeah that we are weighted wherefore let him that thinketh he standed take heed lest he fall now the scripture tells us not to think more highly of ourselves than we ought I'm such a fine Christian I'm such a fine I'm I'm such to this I'm such don't mistake that for being the fact that you need to confess that you are an overcome you need to confess that you are victorious in Jesus Christ so don't be silent on those things thinking that you're becoming he and high minded by declaring that you believe God has made you an overcomer amen God did make you an overcomer and you do have a victory in the battle so stand on that but remember as it is that it was Christ in you amen there's a thing we always need to keep balancing is it's Christ in us we we can't do it oursel and the moment we think we can do it ourself we are headed for the fall and now we'll get down to where we'll really draw our thought from verse 13 there hath no temptation taken you but such as is common to man wow think about it every battle you have God looked down and said that's real common you know the common cold the common yeah just real common but God is faithful can we say Amen who will not suffer you to be tempted above that ye are able amen my we've had some fiery trials in our lives we had times that we just felt like utter failure and in that feeling of utter failure God is telling you I'm not even going to tempt you more than you can withstand more than you're able to overcome and come out of now I I think we could all just take a moment and pause and think about times in where our life when we thought we were literally at The Bitter End and it was just too much and I am done I can't go no further and God says no there was still a margin of error there because I would not put more on you than you could handle oh my you know what that says I'll make another sermon out of that it says you can actually handle a lot more more than you think you can handle and a limitating factor there is this here the Battleground in the mind is the limiting factor and when we would realize that we're not fighting a battle in the mind in the whole overall picture but it is a battle for your soul it's a battle for your position it's actually the real battle my brother and sister is not against Satan as we often view it but it is against the fact that he is trying to keep you from rightly claiming your inheritance my some people have fight a lot harder for a natural inheritance than they would for a spiritual one Lord help us Amen to be able to come but he says you know what but with the Temptation also he makes a way of Escape that you'll be able to Bear it oh thank you Lord thank you Lord now I've met those that say that uh serving God is too hard I've known some men Through the Ages since I was a young man they quit serving the lord not leaving a message but just quit serving God because they said it was too hard as though serving Satan was easy think about this I actually believe serving Satan is actually harder than serving God because Satan takes his toll in entirely different fashion people say when I was a serving God I just had so many mind battles but yet now they're caught up in all kinds of things we won't go down the list in their life that they're torn and pulled this way and pulled that way and you know just all these issues and and they they believe that's simpler you talk about Satan being very clever to anoint in a fashion my brother and sister you know uh it's there you know one time I was giving blood or having blood taken and I I made a comment the a young lady really really scrubed my arm and I said I I guess um I guess uh you really want to make sure there's no no bugs or nothing there and she says uh no actually it was a distraction I looked down she already had the needle in you see sometimes what we think is something a certain way is nothing more than Satan coming distracting us because we tend to focus that you know I never wanted to be a p pickpocket but I studied a little bit and do you know the pp Pockets you know I mean hey why not you know something to look at but but you'll find that pickpockets thrive on distraction and so you know I I know a brother was in Mexico City uh and uh it was riding the train and and uh this man kept driving his knee against the side of his leg and it annoyed him so much and he but he didn't speak any Spanish and and it just annoyed him so much and the man just kept kind of pushing up against him and then he gets off the subway and reaches and his wallet's gone you see that's Satan he's here in the distraction to steal in fact the scripture says he kills Steals and destroys and that sounds like a lot of work that's right because to serve God we don't have to climb over any promise of Satan so there it is but you know that greatest battle ever fought is there now Hebrews 11 and 6 it says but without faith it is impossible to please him for he that cometh to God must believe that he is and that he is a rewarder of them that diligently seek him one of the problems we have my brother and sister is people today don't feel like uh my life is too busy my job demands too much my family demands too much all of this and we don't really have time to diligently seek God my brother and sister I think we ought to stop and real evaluate that and we have time to diligently seek God and he promised that he would give us everything else so while we're trying to accomplish on one side I don't have time my job demands my family demands and blah blah blah he says seek ye first the kingdom of God and all of the rest of this will be added there's a promise of God we can live on that promise cuz he won't fail but if we are here trying to take care of all the other first we'll have problems amen now let's look at this Temptations common to man I'll be a little blunt this more this evening Saints these Temptations they're talking about in in previous scripture there that are common to man are just that we won't go down through the list but they are just that there won't be a man alive I'll be just this blunt there won't be a man alive that doesn't look at a woman at some time in his life might not even be in his heart no desire no nothing Satan anoints that you might say that you walked right into the fog bank and you say Lord forgive me as the prophet said now if you look at the wording how brother brandham put that he put that cross on the mirror of his car he didn't put it on the deacon's car the assistant pastor's car or the leoty of the church he put it on his car that should tell you something amen so it's common to man but we don't want to embrace what is common to man but you see serve the Lord or not these Temptations are present it's here in the world we live in today and many in the wilderness they went out there as they left Egypt there they thought oh praise God God's answering his promise to us they got out in the wilderness they got overthrown but many is not all right that's right and we live in the same kind of world this is a Wilderness of sin and many will fall but not all amen so it's there my brother and sister we don't look at this and say oh my goodness why are you talking about this it's kind of negative it's kind of hard to do no we ought to face it face to face we ought to look at this and say you know what there are temptations that are common to humanity that we are warned about here in the scripture look out for this this is not who you are and you can defend by the word of God against this and so it is there we look at verse 6 and verse 11 it says that these things were given example in samples to us and so it's there my brother and sister we can take the example in its negative context or its positive context it doesn't really matter but it shows us that God has promised to provide a way of Escape regardless when they were in the wilderness of sin just like our Wilderness of sin they were there there were shortcomings they were failures oh I'm talking about the leadership am and God still made a way of Escape for them and allowed them to go forward not under a cloud of condemnation but to be able to go forward with confidence they were doing what God wanted them to do not confidence in the flesh but confidence in the word amen so it was there that we recognize some fall some overcome I want to ask you tonight what are you there's a time we ought to be able to say to ourselves I am an overcomer the position I'm going to claim today which will affect my life it may not affect your Eternal destination but it will affect your life I read a story once about a man in a drunken fight thought he killed a man ran away hid changed his name spent like 28 years running finally he decided that he his mother was dying is actually what Drew him back home no communication nothing ran and hid for 28 years comes back home somebody told the sheriff that he was back the sheriff shows up he's like oh well I ran 28 years for nothing they're going to catch me and the sheriff comes and says man I've missed you so much where have you been and he's like like you're not here to arrest me for so and so's death you didn't do that he said no I did I was there no no it was after you did this and this that this person killed him see he ran and hid from his reality that's why God is peeling back the layers of our onion tonight no matter what it is small or large he's peeling it back so we can face the reality of who we are in Jesus Christ we can run we can run we can run and we can say I'm guilty I did this I'm guilty I'm guilty I'm guilty and God says you never did it in the first place and so we can be caught up in our own realm of guilt and our own condemnation and not even be charged by the almighty God the only judge that matters is our Lord Jesus Christ and he says I don't even hold it against you but Satan would like us to think so right amen so verse 12 wherefore let him thinketh he uh standeth take heed lest he fall no temptation taketh you but is common to man but God is faithful who will not suffer you to be tempted above that ye are able I want you to think about that in our everyday life Saints everything that we face today the prophet of God says the real believer doesn't want to do it in the first place but Satan tricks them amen and God comes along and lays it in the word and said I'm not going to lay anything on you but what you will be able to Bear it amen what do we do now trust oursel no or trust God see he says I I won't put it on you that's right we know the thought we have thought we know the Deeds that we have done we know the things of our life past and present and God says I knew it before you ever did it and I still say you never did it in the first place see God wants us to understand Saints of what we are able my you know there's so many stories that are so incredible of of different events through time that show what the ability of of humanity and the flesh is far beyond what man thinks he can do and we see just in natural disasters and things that happen how people rise up and how they're able to just perform above and beyond what is imaginable and and that's just in the natural now please take and bring that over into the spiritual and God has placed in you the seed Gene of our Lord Jesus Christ who himself while embracing the cross went to the Cross knowing anointed that he would rise from that cross because he said so yeah he didn't rise because of any other reason than he said he would redeem you and I he didn't have any point to prove he didn't have to show off to the devil he didn't have to spill one drop of blood to redeem us didn't have to but he says this is how it starts started right here at the Garden that little lamb actually to be correct it started before the foundation of the world and that lamb was brought forth and placed it was placed to Abraham and it's coming right down because that lamb is present today those soldiers if you be this Son of God why don't you just come down off that cross you know if Jesus had gave into that Temptation 10,000 angels would have just cleared a swath across that country and no one would understood even what happened it would just been Annihilation but he knew what he was able I Lay My Life down and I raise it up again amen he knew he was able to do that now if Christ is in you which is what the word says amen then we have the ability tonight to lay our lives down and it isn't always in the fashion we think it might be my brother and sister that we have a grudge or bitterness or something between us and somebody that we literally could lay our life down and take the blame and walk away and say I know it's not my fault but Lord I just I take it am amen that's a nature a spirit of Christ being manifested in us because you see the minute that they abused our Lord Jesus Christ if we had a common human reaction there he would then had a grudge and a retribution against them but he said Lord they don't even know what they do that's right now I I'm not asking you to give an answer might shock me but how many of you actually say that forgive them Lord they don't know what they're even doing and you say but but but no no it might be to their benefit but I can assure you it's to yours that's right that when you lay that down that's right brother Lonnie Jenkins many years ago and I have some of that little research he sent me years ago I don't know where it would be hopefully I still have it the effect of bitterness on people's Health it was actually startling they did all kinds of of research of of bringing up uh old hurts why they have all kinds of heart monitor brain monitor all this stuff and you know people something happened 25 30 years ago and it's talked about it and their heart rate goes up their breathing changes all of these brain waves change to realize that unrepented or Unforgiven is there to to just destroy people and Satan just pushes the button any of you had your button pushed yes sir and you know what they say button pushing it's usually someone Close to You y wow usually someone [Laughter] close oh my [Laughter] goodness sometimes you see things from the pulpits you really wish you had saw so he's declaring there's nothing that you're not able to handle let's take that thought into our next trial our next tribulation our next struggle I can handle this do I like what someone said what someone did I do I like the circumstances do I like the fact the wheels fell off the wagon no but you know what I'm going to be better off if I just allow this to go away to be put down now I want to hurry along here as the eagle stirreth up her nest brother Bram says God is not afraid to put you on a trial my oh my now you must have confidence to just volunteer yourself to be put into a trial and God must have confidence when he takes you and put you in the trial that's right God's not specialized Ing and giving points to the devil we got to play fair we're in the age of everything must be fair no my brother and sister when he said to Job Satan said oh yeah you got him all hedged up said make him break that hedge around him and I'll make him curse you to your face and he said he's in your hands oh my God is not afraid to put his Eagles to a flight test he's not afraid he's depending on you right why isn't that something we usually feel like we're completely dependent on God and we are but God also has made this plan in such a fashion and has such faith in his word that is in you that you will stand to the test because he's already said he'll not let anything more than you can handle be placed upon you and he knows that you will stand with that word amen not a afraid to put his Eagles to a flight test he's not afraid he's depending on you he wasn't afraid to put Abraham to a flight test he was depending on him now my brother and sister if Abraham had not had a voice I mean had an ear that could hear the voice he would have killed his son but he was so in tune with God and that's what God knew that he was so in tune that when the knife began to plunge and God said stop he knew the knife would stop and so it was there was that an ultimate test for Abraham I'm sure Abraham would not have readily said Lord just take me out there and um I'll I'll slay my son for a test no but I'll tell you what Abraham did have he had such confidence in God that promise that God had given on Isaac he knew that if he took his life that God would raise it back up again he didn't promise to have a son named whatever Bob or Joe or whatever but Isaac was the promised son to fulfill this Redemption and Abraham had enough faith in God to go and he said whatever it is amen now my brother and sister I've always marveled how that you could have a Ram stuck in a Thicket and no one can see it until their eyes are opened yeah could I say something real bold sounds a little judgy we're sitting here tonight and our eyes are not fully open there's many promises of God that have been promised to us and we're looking at those as though they are a far off well when we get enough faith for a Rapture when we get enough faith for this and we get enough of this my brother and sister it's a matter of our eyes being opened and the eyes were open because of complete trust amen the world calls it blind trust when you have that much faith in something so call it blind trust I want to be blinded to everything but the promise I want to be blinded to every circumstance but what God has promised to you and I amen let that be blind trust but I'm telling you you can't have one foot in the world and one foot in the in the gospel and expect to get anywhere because they're going two different directions amen he wasn't afraid to put Abraham to a flight test he was depending on he was not afraid to put Abraham's seed to a flight test because he's depending on you amen oh my brother and sister in Hebrews 11 those all those Patriarchs all those Saints all those men of the Gospel they are waiting for our manifestation they are depending on that they will not be made complete without you and I and we are here tonight sometimes wondering Lord are we gaining ground or am I alone on this sometimes feel like I don't think I'm growing spiritually at all but let me just come back to what I mentioned on Sunday my brother and sister there's a mantle that has fallen been promised to fall in this day and it won't be a mantle that's a big blanket draping dragging on the ground it will be a perfect fit it will be the word coming down tailored for you and I amen but when I say tailored for you and I it's actually God molding you and I to the word not the word to you and I and we need to have enough confidence in God that when he goes to trimming away or if he goes to padding us up a little bit that we believe that is of god that it's the word that is changing our life opening our understanding giving us Revelation and correcting false understandings from the past and this is God working my brother and sister because we have to come to that place where we are the perfect representation of the word we can't add to it we can't take away from it we have to be the absolute perfect fit of the mantle of the word in this hour did that all make sense amen now look he's not fearful for us why are we fearful that fearful spirit that gets on us is not of God that's right and we need to come to a point recognize this acknowledge this stand on this that that fearful Spirit wherever it comes from now I'm not talking about the natural one where you know you're standing on the peak of a roof and and uh you know somebody says jump off and a little fear comes upon you and Common Sense and fear sometimes travel together in the natural I'm not talking about that kind amen but to be literally unable inability to grasp the word and apply it that's the kind of fear that Satan's putting on people dealing with people my brother and sister they're like well I I I'm just Bound by fear I can't do this I can't do this I'm just bound I just can't do this well my brother and sister the word said you can do all things through Christ Jesus amen so you don't have to worry about stepping out and finding that you're in a false promise cuz God said that he would not let you be C up in a false Doctrine now when I say that I'm not saying for little season many people have did that but if you're a son or daughter of God he will bring you back out of that it's his promise amen if he's not fearful for us why should we be fearful for ourselves now I'm not talking about being ridiculous if you take everything you own and invest it in a gold mining expedition to the Amazon forest you probably should be afraid that's foolish we're not talking about that kind of stuff L Circle back to this the word is right here amen what is stopping us from taking the word amen and doing exactly what the word said we should do what is stopping us fear misrepresenting a quote been men misrepresented to you what are my favorite quotes I have to admit is a prophet of God saying keep planting your potatoes get this a brother ins sincere asking did Brother brandham mean that literally I don't know whether to slap him or slap me the prophet's talking in a spiritual context and now Brothers wanting to know if every every real believer is going to have potatoes in their backyard come on let's use a little sense here amen it is not about potatoes he's talking if I'm allowed to use that word about a concept a principle apply the principle and when we apply the principle we'll get up every morning and water the word and we'll keep the weeds out of the word and then we'll keep the weeds out of our life because the word is keeping the weeds out of our life and the word is watering us and we're watering the word we're praising God and God is blessing us for those Praises that's a win-win situation we praise God and God blesses us amen my in the world my brother and sister they would say oh that's like a Ponzi scheme or something like that you know promising something else God's promises are not empty and they're never have an end to them it's continually going God is continually blessing his bride and continually protecting his bride he's continually taking care of everything in our life you say but I've had hard time so job he's depending on us oh and let's not leave this one part out the way of Escape is is already made yes sir we're not sitting here waiting that's exactly right oh my waiting do you know there's a phrase that has to do with inheritance and old people and greedy children and these are the people that don't really care about their parents or grandparents and they are sitting around waiting for them to die so they can collect their inheritance and they call them waiters they're waiters can't even write a postcard to a mom and dad or a grandparent or something they're just waiting for the reading of the will I'm wondering are we waiters say that out loud Brother David look louder little louder come on the will has already been read thank you thank you we are already in our adoption we are already in our inheritance you see my brother and sister we're not waiters amen we're living in Heavenly places right here and if we're not we need to get down get serious with God so that we can live in Heavenly places cuz that's what's been promised to us amen now I'll go ahead John 14 1-6 let not your heart be troubled you believe in God believe also in me in my father's house are many mansions and if it were not so I would have told you I go to prepare a place for you if I go and prepare a place for you I will come again and receive you un myself these sound like promises these sound like commitments that where I am there ye may be also and whether I go ye know now we'll see a bigger picture and we'll touch on it but I want to remember that whether I go ye know and the way ye know and Thomas said unto him Lord we know not whether thou goest and how can we know the way now we'll stop shy at verse six but look at this my brother and sister how when we have a wrong interpretation of the word we're looking at the word and not comparing it and getting it lined up because Jesus has already answered these questions to the apostles to the disciples all of this down through time he's already answered this but the humanity comes and says this is too simple there's got to be we don't even know the way and Jesus has already been showing them the way showing them uh the proper you know way of of um uh I lost my thought right there um uh the already the provided place of worship he's already showed that to them but they got caught up in another thought trying to interpret this just like there you know which one is the greatest we're in the presence of Jesus Christ amen and our deepest concern is you telling us which one is the greatest no wonder Jesus rebuked them they totally missed the whole picture they totally missed the the whole thing because they were caught or captured in a carnal position and they couldn't get out of the carnal position because they were not Discerning of the spirit if they had discerned the spirit they would have realized but Jesus comes and says unto him I am the way amen we don't even know the way Jesus Jesus Jesus I I I'm sorry I I Lord I don't mean to be but I I wonder if Jesus didn't like do that like I'm the way did you guys missed this in the whole equation I'm the way the truth and the life and no man cometh into the father but by me I want to ask you are we able the word says we're able we need to be saying we're able you see my brother and sister it all comes apart if we sit down in that position I'm not able I'm not able the whole plan of God doesn't put us out but we're what's muddying up the water we're what when we're confessing uh it's a thought to preach on future I don't know exactly but um Jesus meets our brothers on the way to emus and he comes up what manner of conversation is this that ye are sad in the way when that struck me studying a certain thought future sermon I thought Lord Don't Judge Me by my conversations I believe this word I believe you're here I believe the seventh seal is open Christ is in me amen but my conversation doesn't always project that this is wrong that is wrong if he was still living if he had done this if he hadn't did this and why did this come cuz we've come to not now why did why didn't the prophet live to to be 10 whatever it would be 119 years and why didn't he somehow able to answer everyone's question so he could just show all of us to do this well my brother and sister you know we say if the Lord Jesus was here tonight he could do nothing more for you that's right then what he's already done this might sound like heresy to some if the prophet was here tonight right he couldn't do any more for us than he already he did he's given us the key right and we are able to take that key and open the word and live that word oh Lord help us that the devil trying to tell us we're not able we are more than able amen hallelujah amen it's already been provided to us in the mark of the beast brother Alex if you're playing the piano I guess you are please come Mark of the Beast brother brandom this is a prayer and I'm closing on this right here brother Bram says our heavenly father we approach thy Throne thy great Throne of Mercy In The Name Of The Lord Jesus our savior we approach that way because he told us to come thus and we would receive what we asked for what this is is putting you and I in our correct position to worship God's provided Place God's provided [Music] way that we come thus and would receive what we ask for and we're so glad to know that we can rest in our hearts upon that assurance that what you say you're a able to perform for tonight we feel that we are by faith Abraham's seed and anything contrary to God's word we act as though it was not amen realize just how important that is yes sir anything contrary we don't even give it place that's exactly right amen because God has said truth and we believe he has the truth and he is truth you know we would never allow a statue of Baal in our sanctuary and then just throw a sheet over it and act as though it wasn't so see God wants us to cast out every doubt every fear every spot of unbelief and then stand so firm on the word and when times get tough remind ourselves by the word we are able amen we are able God bless you tonight Saints amen let's [Music] stand 999 please I don't know if I can if I get the whole song Right amen it's already done it's already done battle is over the victory been won oh it's already done I'm already s I'm always F battle is over Victory been won oh I'm already sealed my family is still my

you know when David walked down there to the [Music] brook he didn't go down there saying you know I I think there's a one in 1,000 chance God already spoke to him every stone he picked up was predestinated a whole brook full of stones that would have qualified but God said here's where the victory lies right here and he went against all laws Saul says you need to you need to wear my church's armor others said you need to this and this and that and finally David's like I need to do what God told me to do and he went down there and God made him Victorious amen oh God bless you Saints brother Isaac if you would just lead us I trust that this made sense tonight I jumped over a couple little things uh sometimes you know you have a glitch in the middle of what you're doing but I trust that God bless [Music] you amen that was the uh first song that I'd written down you know I I read an account years ago I don't remember what war it was Civil War World War II whatever it was but there was these soldiers and they were still fighting and some other guys wrote up they're like what are you guys still fighting for it's over we've already won you know isn't that how it is God's telling us that in his word over and over and over again it's it's done I've already won it for you what are you fighting for amen hallelujah let's just s sing that again it's already done it's already done battle is over the victory been won and it's already done I'm already here I'm already seal the Battle Is Over the victory been one and I'm already sealed I'm already healed amen I'm
