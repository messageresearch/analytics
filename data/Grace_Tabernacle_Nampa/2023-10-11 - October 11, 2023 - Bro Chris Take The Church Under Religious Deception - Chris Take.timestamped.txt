[41:27] Bibles tonight which I hope you do came
[41:29] to
[41:30] church hopefully you brought your Bible
[41:33] and you didn't borrow one at the back
[41:36] door A B borrowed you never know the
[41:39] condition of a borrowed sword Galatians
[41:41] chapter
[41:45] one Galatians chapter 1 verse one nice
[41:49] to have my sister Melody with us
[41:52] tonight Galatians chapter 1 verse one
[42:01] says Paul an apostle not of men neither
[42:03] by man but by Jesus Christ and God the
[42:06] Father who raised him from the dead and
[42:09] all the Brethren which are with me unto
[42:11] the churches of galatia Grace be to you
[42:14] and peace from God the father and from
[42:16] our Lord Jesus Christ who gave himself
[42:18] for our sins that he might Deliver Us
[42:21] from this present evil world according
[42:24] to the will of God and our
[42:28] father to him be glory forever and ever
[42:32] amen I like how Paul opens his letter
[42:34] and he puts he puts the focus on God
[42:39] puts the Focus On Christ you know in in
[42:41] our in our song and our worship and our
[42:45] prayer we should always be mindful to
[42:47] lift him
[42:48] up it's not all about us amen verse six
[42:52] I Marvel not that you are so soon
[42:55] removed I excuse me I Marvel that you
[42:58] are so soon removed from him that called
[43:00] you into the grace of Christ onto
[43:03] another
[43:05] gospel so the devil has a gospel the
[43:08] Antichrist has a gospel which is not
[43:11] another but there be some that trouble
[43:13] you and would pervert the gospel of
[43:16] Christ remember the the devil can't
[43:17] create amen but though we or an angel
[43:21] from heaven preach any other gospel unto
[43:23] you than that which we have preached
[43:25] unto to you let him be ACC cursed as we
[43:28] said before so say I now again if any
[43:31] man preach any other gospel unto you
[43:33] that you have received let him be a
[43:35] cursed I don't know of any other spot in
[43:39] the Bible where back to back the same
[43:42] exact words are
[43:43] repeated in other words this is really
[43:45] really important Paul has has brought
[43:48] the word let's just Paul has brought the
[43:51] word to the
[43:52] Galatians he's preached to them now he's
[43:54] writing to them okay so he you don't
[43:56] write a letter to somebody per se you
[43:58] never met you meet them you form a
[44:00] relationship then you text or you call
[44:02] in our world their world they write a
[44:04] letter so Paul's already preached to
[44:05] them he's already laid it out for them
[44:08] and now he's writing to them and he's
[44:09] saying what in the world has happened
[44:11] you are so quickly removed he says for I
[44:14] for do I now persuade men or God or do I
[44:18] seek to please men for if I yet pleased
[44:22] men I should not be the servant of
[44:25] Christ amen may the Lord bless the
[44:26] reading of his word you can be seated
[44:29] tonight so Paul is is saying
[44:33] here feels weird not taking my jacket
[44:35] off but we've had some technical
[44:37] difficulties so it's going to be on
[44:39] tonight he says did I did I come did I
[44:44] come to please
[44:45] men and he says if I came to please men
[44:49] then then I'm not the servant of Christ
[44:52] you see the conflict the conflict that
[44:54] we face as as as sons and knowledge of
[44:56] God so I'd like to take tonight for
[44:59] title and and um I tried to clear it up
[45:03] with the guys at the back last time I
[45:05] preached the title that they used was
[45:07] going to be my title but then God had me
[45:09] not preach that so now I'm preaching it
[45:11] so this is the the right title for this
[45:14] service we got to fix that one my title
[45:16] tonight is the church under religious
[45:19] deception I'd like to to you know Lord
[45:22] have his Liberty and the next few weeks
[45:26] or whatever I would love to have a some
[45:28] more time to go into this I just been in
[45:30] this vein now for about a few weeks and
[45:33] and would just feeling led to bring this
[45:35] out and so there's a lot in here and um
[45:39] I I know we're not going to get to all
[45:41] of it
[45:43] tonight 1 John chapter
[45:47] 4 1 John chapter 4 verse
[45:51] one so for context in Galatians Paul
[45:55] says I'm surprised I Marvel that you are
[45:58] so soon removed from the gospel that and
[46:01] he says another gospel has been preached
[46:03] to you a perverted gospel of
[46:05] Christ and he says if it's different
[46:08] than what I've said don't perceive it
[46:11] even if it comes from an angel okay so
[46:14] you see we're not we're not called to
[46:16] determine God's word based on who's
[46:18] delivering it that's right we are called
[46:21] to base God's the truth on God's word
[46:24] that's why we have it that's why
[46:26] protected this book for thousands of
[46:27] years is this right here even Paul you
[46:31] know I was reading reading uh well I'm
[46:33] not going to get a sidet track 1 John 4
[46:35] verse 1 beloved believe not every Spirit
[46:40] but try the spirits whether they are of
[46:42] God because many false prophets are gone
[46:44] out into the world okay so so should so
[46:47] now should we all be afraid and
[46:49] skeptical you know I think a little bit
[46:51] of SK
[46:52] skepticism a little dose would be good
[46:55] for some of us yes but we're not called
[46:57] to be pessimistic or skeptical in
[47:00] general but we're called to try
[47:03] everything by the word of God it's got
[47:06] to go through the word of God now I'm
[47:08] laying a foundation here for an example
[47:10] we're going to take from the scriptures
[47:11] so pay close attention says because many
[47:14] false prophets are gone out into the
[47:15] world we don't need to go fear we have
[47:18] the truth doesn't match the truth right
[47:21] when you see to know about the real
[47:22] dollar hereby there's hundreds and
[47:25] thousands of dollars there's only one
[47:27] real dollar if you know the real dollar
[47:30] you'll know the false dollar amen hereby
[47:33] know ye that the spirit of God every
[47:36] spirit that confesseth so he's like he's
[47:38] identifying John is identifying the
[47:40] spirit of God he says it's every spirit
[47:42] that confesseth that Jesus Christ has
[47:44] come in the flesh is of God and every
[47:47] spirit that confesseth not that Jesus
[47:49] Christ has come in the flesh is not of
[47:51] God and this is that Spirit of
[47:53] antichrist whereof ye have heard heard
[47:55] that it should come and even now already
[47:58] it is in the world you have to remember
[48:00] the word of God is alive and breathing
[48:02] so when you read the scriptures it is
[48:05] present amen okay so presently this is
[48:08] where we are amen he says you are of God
[48:12] little children and have overcome them
[48:14] because greater is he that is in you so
[48:16] he brings some scary stuff and then he
[48:19] backs it up with don't
[48:20] fear do not fear you have overcome them
[48:23] you have already overcome them amen
[48:26] because greater is he that is in you
[48:27] than he that is in the world he's better
[48:29] be in you though they are of the world
[48:32] therefore speak they of the world and
[48:34] the world heareth them we are of God he
[48:37] that knoweth God heareth he we are of
[48:40] God he that knoweth God heareth us amen
[48:42] he that is not of God heareth not us
[48:44] hereby know we the spirit of truth and
[48:46] the spirit of error so there's two
[48:48] Spirits all right now over into
[48:54] Jude
[48:56] Jude we'll start in verse
[49:02] one I'm I'm flying this this reading by
[49:06] the leading of the I'm taking this
[49:08] reading by the leading of the of the
[49:09] Holy Spirit I'm not sure where we'll
[49:11] stop I'd love to read the whole thing so
[49:13] we might end up doing that he says Jude
[49:15] Jude the servant of Jesus Christ and
[49:17] brother of James to them that are
[49:18] Sanctified by God the father and
[49:20] preserved in Jesus Christ and called
[49:22] Mercy unto you and peace and love be
[49:24] multiplied beloved when I gave all the
[49:26] diligence to write unto you of the
[49:28] common salvation it was needful for me
[49:31] to write unto you and exhort you that
[49:33] you should earnestly contend for the
[49:35] faith which was once delivered unto the
[49:39] Saints so once delivered unto the Saints
[49:42] so there's something happening who Jude
[49:44] is writing to there's a battle happening
[49:46] there's a conflict happening and and
[49:48] something is is is is is seeping into
[49:50] the church something has come into the
[49:52] church and he's saying look he says go
[49:54] back to the the faith that was delivered
[49:57] to you he's echoing Paul he's echoing
[50:00] Paul saying go back to what you have
[50:02] heard the original truth go back to that
[50:06] take what you've heard and run it
[50:08] through the filter he says for there are
[50:12] certain men crept in unawares so we got
[50:17] concerned and we get concerned when
[50:19] suddenly somebody surprises us when they
[50:23] manifest Antichrist
[50:26] Spirit but it's scriptural that that
[50:29] Spirit comes in unawares am that's right
[50:33] because now we're going to be surprised
[50:35] people are going to surprise us till the
[50:37] day we lead this Earth
[50:40] but we got to remember that this is part
[50:43] of the process and if you're anchored in
[50:46] the word of God because it's it's it's
[50:48] deception it's deception it's not
[50:51] supposed to be obvious amen if it was
[50:54] obvious look look people are all not
[50:58] everybody but in general kind of worked
[51:00] up about voice of God and the message
[51:02] that they're
[51:03] preaching that's not the razer's edge
[51:06] brother B talks about to be so close who
[51:08] would deceive the very elect if it was
[51:09] possible he said it would be like a
[51:11] Razor's Edge we all know the the message
[51:15] that they preach that brother brandham
[51:17] is their absolute and the tapes that's
[51:20] really far out there that is not close
[51:22] to the truth at all that's right we
[51:25] understand that and if we're not careful
[51:26] we look at that the devil has always got
[51:29] something that's far out there to
[51:30] distract
[51:31] us way out there says wow you know for
[51:34] years we preached against the
[51:36] denominations brother man I'm already
[51:37] dealt with that they're out there we're
[51:40] here and while we're preaching out
[51:41] against somebody else beyond our walls
[51:44] inside our walls we have we have certain
[51:49] men crept in
[51:50] unawareness because we're too focused on
[51:52] well that well that's look that's
[51:54] obvious right
[51:56] it is not obvious that spirit that is so
[51:59] close the Antichrist Spirit that's so
[52:01] close is not obvious if you are not a
[52:05] student of the word of God if you are
[52:08] not focused and feeding on the faith
[52:11] which was once delivered unto
[52:14] you it's not
[52:16] obvious but you but get in the word of
[52:21] God you see can't you can't just come to
[52:24] church it's it's fun
[52:25] girl boyfriend girlfriend relationship
[52:27] people all over the message have a
[52:29] boyfriend girlfriend relationship with
[52:31] Christ all the good feels that's right
[52:34] all the good feels zero
[52:38] responsibility the okay there's been a
[52:41] lot that I've been studying and and and
[52:43] thinking about and so I'm trying to I
[52:44] pray God keep Lord keep me focused on
[52:46] the thought tonight he says okay so he
[52:48] says who were before of old ordained to
[52:51] this condemnation ungodly men turning
[52:54] the grace of our God into lasciviousness
[52:56] and denying the only Lord God and our
[52:58] Lord Jesus Christ now you have to
[53:01] remember he he's Jude is calling this
[53:04] Spirit out but the spirit when it's
[53:06] working is not walking up to you and
[53:08] saying I don't believe God is God that's
[53:11] right the spirit is preaching that's
[53:15] right Jude underneath the anointing of
[53:17] the holy spirit is calling it out for
[53:18] what it is he's calling out saying hey
[53:20] look they're denying God they're denying
[53:23] the Lord Jesus Christ but that Spirit of
[53:26] deception is working in the
[53:28] church it looks like your brother it
[53:31] looks like your sister that's right okay
[53:34] it's clothed in religion that's right
[53:37] that's why the title tonight is
[53:38] religious
[53:41] deception I will therefore put you in
[53:44] remembrance amen you know what have you
[53:47] ever thought about the fact that to P
[53:49] we've been put into the into remembrance
[53:52] we've been put in remembrance of the
[53:54] original word that's right and what are
[53:56] we do when we take communion that's
[53:59] right we're doing it in remembrance you
[54:02] see Israel put this pillar here it's a
[54:06] thing to remember amen why because time
[54:09] goes on and with time memories
[54:13] fade God doesn't God doesn't forget he
[54:16] forgets your sin but he doesn't forget
[54:18] he remembers everything he's Eternal all
[54:20] things are are are the same for him it's
[54:22] one big canvas but we are time we are
[54:25] creatures of time so if we don't write
[54:28] it down if we don't put a thing put a
[54:31] pen or put a put a Mark or a a bookmark
[54:33] or we forget we don't take a picture if
[54:35] we don't write it in our Journal that
[54:37] memory Fades with time now God uses time
[54:42] and so does the devil over time the
[54:45] devil tells a lie and it starts off a
[54:47] little bit here a little bit there but
[54:50] the longer you hear that lie the more
[54:52] you accept it as truth that's right so
[54:55] it's deception it's it's
[55:00] it's okay and the angels which kept not
[55:04] excuse me you in remembrance though you
[55:05] once knew this how that the Lord having
[55:07] saved the people out of the land of
[55:09] Egypt afterward destroyed them that
[55:11] believed not and the angels which kept
[55:14] their first estate but left their own
[55:18] habitation he hath reserved an
[55:20] everlasting chains under Darkness until
[55:22] the day of the great Judgment of the
[55:24] great day
[55:32] okay praise the Lord we're going to stop
[55:34] there in June maybe we'll come back um
[55:36] in the everpresent water from the rock
[55:39] we know that Israel has always been a
[55:41] historical example so we've laid a bit
[55:44] of a foundation in the scriptures where
[55:45] Jude Paul they're addressing and John
[55:51] addressing this Spirit of deception in
[55:53] the church now I want to I I want to
[55:55] take and we're going to step over and
[55:57] we're going to look at how Israel types
[55:58] the church he says we know that Israel
[56:01] has always been a historical example of
[56:02] the church because Israel was the people
[56:05] of God until they came out of Egypt then
[56:08] they were the Church of God because they
[56:10] were separated from the rest of the
[56:11] world and when we are separated from the
[56:14] rest of the world then we become the
[56:16] church now remember I'm laying a
[56:18] foundation Romans 9:6-7 not as though
[56:21] the word of God hath taken none effect
[56:24] for they are not all Israel which are of
[56:27] Israel so Israel types the church and
[56:31] Paul tells the Romans look not everybody
[56:33] that's Israel is Israel that's right
[56:35] then he says neither because they are
[56:37] are the Seed of Abraham are they all
[56:41] children but in Isaac shall thy seed be
[56:44] called so Isaac is a type of Christ so
[56:47] now we have a separation here we have
[56:49] the church which is the called out
[56:51] people but inside the church is the seed
[56:56] of Isaac that's right okay because not
[56:58] all church is seed that's right amen so
[57:04] in this day the scripture is fulfilled
[57:06] so the church really is in birth pains
[57:08] tonight again for the Deliverance of the
[57:10] Son of God to come again that's right
[57:12] all of our theologians all of our
[57:14] systems all of our denominations has
[57:16] rotted right out from under us so we are
[57:20] in birth pains and the message from God
[57:23] always through throws the church in
[57:26] heavier
[57:27] pains but after a while now watch
[57:30] carefully what he says here he says
[57:31] after a while she who she the church is
[57:35] going to be delivered of a bride that'll
[57:39] bring forth Jesus Christ amen to his
[57:42] bride amen all right
[57:45] so there's a bride in the church that's
[57:48] right and who is the church the church
[57:50] is Israel not the Baptist not the
[57:54] denomination
[57:55] it's the church what we what we call the
[57:58] message Church okay so not all messages
[58:03] seed that's right now we only bring that
[58:07] up because it's important to know the
[58:10] two Spirits operating in the framework
[58:12] of the church that's right amen the only
[58:16] way to know is you got to know the
[58:18] book The Seed is not air with the
[58:22] shook I listen just listen to this
[58:25] sermon and uh I'm up in the attic cuz
[58:27] I'm remodeling my
[58:29] house crammed in the Attic no place to
[58:33] dance because it's just every time God
[58:36] reveals something to you let me tell you
[58:38] this when God reveals something to you
[58:41] gives you a nugget you know what you
[58:43] should do take that and run it back
[58:45] through everything you've already heard
[58:47] because you'll hear it differently
[58:49] that's
[58:50] right he says in he says Church natural
[58:54] Church spiritual spiritual there is a
[58:55] church natural that these women here
[58:58] type and there's a church spiritual also
[59:01] so the natural church and the spiritual
[59:03] church cannot be heirs together
[59:07] why wrong seed that's right they are two
[59:11] different separate times you've got the
[59:14] wheat and you've got the tears amen okay
[59:19] do they come from two totally
[59:22] different branches that's right they are
[59:24] two different separate times two
[59:26] different separate peoples under two
[59:27] different separate covenants he says
[59:30] that's why the Rapture is different and
[59:31] will only be for the Royal Seed of
[59:34] Abraham it cannot come by the natural
[59:38] carnal seed of the say it for me church
[59:41] church
[59:43] amen so the seat of the
[59:46] church the church doctrine is not enough
[59:50] amen it's not going to change your life
[59:53] it's going to conform you Amen to a
[59:57] culture that's right that's right you
[1:00:00] are going to be in love with God but
[1:00:03] it's a
[1:00:05] fio it's a boyfriend girlfriend that's
[1:00:08] right amen and in the Church of God
[1:00:10] there'll be no fornication so guess what
[1:00:13] you're not H receiving any seed that's
[1:00:15] right exactly right when me and my wife
[1:00:19] met each other I mean we okay we're we
[1:00:22] are deeply in love but it was different
[1:00:25] when we were just boyfriend girlfriend
[1:00:26] when we were recording it was all the
[1:00:29] happy feels you know and that's what
[1:00:30] happens people try to they think that's
[1:00:33] it so then when they get married and
[1:00:34] that's not there anymore they think
[1:00:36] they've lost love for one another that's
[1:00:38] right but that is just the very
[1:00:40] beginning it's the
[1:00:43] attraction okay so so real quick real
[1:00:46] quick not to deviate too far what is the
[1:00:49] attraction at the what's the what is our
[1:00:51] goal our goal is Christ our goal is
[1:00:55] adoption that's right we will not lead
[1:00:56] this Earth till we are adopted because
[1:00:59] why do we need to write checks in in
[1:01:00] glory we need to write checks here amen
[1:01:03] that's right okay so adoption is not
[1:01:05] coming when we go on the Rapture
[1:01:07] adoption is not coming on side adoption
[1:01:08] happens here Amen in the promised land
[1:01:11] okay
[1:01:14] so what is the base adoption is the
[1:01:16] statue of a perfect man brother Bram
[1:01:19] says and he when he preaches that sermon
[1:01:21] the statute of perfect man he says this
[1:01:22] is the perfect bridge between the church
[1:01:24] ages and the Seven
[1:01:26] Seals
[1:01:28] why go back and listen to it anyways
[1:01:31] what's the very first what's the base of
[1:01:33] the pyramid Faith
[1:01:36] amen all the good feels all the good
[1:01:40] supernatural things all of that Miracles
[1:01:43] and everything that happens in that
[1:01:45] first Foundation which is faith that is
[1:01:49] exciting it's exciting to see someone's
[1:01:51] broken arm go straight and healed again
[1:01:55] but that act doesn't save the person or
[1:01:57] you amen it just attracts you Amen to
[1:02:01] the truth because because where God is
[1:02:04] there's going to be that kind of stuff
[1:02:06] so what has happened we have put all the
[1:02:08] focus on the foundation amen why because
[1:02:11] we can see it with our eyes and we can
[1:02:13] feel it with our flesh Amen brother
[1:02:15] bandam says more than one place you
[1:02:17] cannot contact god with your five senses
[1:02:20] that's right you have to contact god
[1:02:22] with faith amen but that's just the
[1:02:24] beginning because what is perfection
[1:02:28] Divine love amen 1 Corinthians 13 Paul
[1:02:31] tells the
[1:02:32] Corinthians hope faith hope love or
[1:02:36] charity above all this charity amen so
[1:02:41] love agapo love is greater than Faith
[1:02:45] amen but what do we do we talk about
[1:02:49] faith faith faith that's just the
[1:02:52] beginning amen that is just just the
[1:02:54] foundation to then step to what oh
[1:02:59] virtue that's right
[1:03:01] patience knowledge but you will never
[1:03:04] step up until you receive the
[1:03:07] responsibility of being his wife
[1:03:11] amen but that's hard to do because you
[1:03:14] have to surrender your will you have to
[1:03:17] surrender your
[1:03:19] desires young ladies who aren't married
[1:03:22] when you get married to your husband you
[1:03:24] now do his will if he's a good man his
[1:03:27] will will line up exactly with your
[1:03:29] heart if he's a bad
[1:03:31] man but hopefully you don't ever that
[1:03:33] you're not married you find the bad ones
[1:03:35] and you walk away from
[1:03:37] them but your will is wrapped up in
[1:03:43] him why that's why God that's why the
[1:03:46] devil attacks that right there so hard
[1:03:48] in the society today so he says Church
[1:03:51] natural Church spiritual so you have to
[1:03:55] contact God so I asked I asked I'm going
[1:03:59] to ask you this
[1:04:00] question maybe I'll give you the answer
[1:04:02] maybe I'll just let you chew on
[1:04:07] it describe to me the power of God
[1:04:11] moving on a
[1:04:13] person describe to me the power of God
[1:04:16] falling in a church
[1:04:20] service okay just chew on that one why
[1:04:23] am why I'm against organized religion he
[1:04:27] says that's the reason I have spoke
[1:04:29] against the
[1:04:31] church okay the holy spirit's holding me
[1:04:33] back the answer to that
[1:04:36] statement you can't that's right because
[1:04:40] the real manifestation of the spirit of
[1:04:42] God you can't see with your eyes that's
[1:04:43] right you see the blessings you see
[1:04:46] outward emotions but you can't use that
[1:04:49] to gauge God moving because music will
[1:04:53] touch your spirit spirit and will move
[1:04:55] you without Christ that's right a man's
[1:04:59] words will touch you in spirit and move
[1:05:02] you without Christ that's right but what
[1:05:05] are the fruits you're bearing
[1:05:08] amen that that's it is the question that
[1:05:12] is The Testament so you can't look at
[1:05:15] somebody in a church service who's
[1:05:16] weeping laid on the floor and say God
[1:05:18] touched them God changed them you can't
[1:05:21] do
[1:05:22] that you have to wait and
[1:05:25] watch brother B says why is SE not Arrow
[1:05:28] to shook he said they couldn't wait for
[1:05:33] God to come so they manifested that he
[1:05:36] says they committed
[1:05:39] adultery go listen back to the tape but
[1:05:41] I don't want to get off off on that but
[1:05:43] I just needed to slide that in there the
[1:05:45] Holy Spirit wanted to slide that in
[1:05:46] there that's the reason okay now I want
[1:05:49] to identify this separation here between
[1:05:52] the church because you still hear
[1:05:55] sometimes the question of of and this is
[1:05:57] just for for you know we're all coming
[1:05:59] along in our spiritual journey so maybe
[1:06:01] this is something you already know maybe
[1:06:02] it's not but this is just to really lay
[1:06:05] that foundation in strongly that the
[1:06:07] church is the message okay he says in
[1:06:10] why am I why I'm against organized
[1:06:12] religion 1962 he says that's the reason
[1:06:15] I have spoke against the church the
[1:06:17] lodge I can't call it a church there's
[1:06:20] only one church that's the Church of the
[1:06:23] body of Christ
[1:06:24] but these lodges that's called Church my
[1:06:26] Bible tells me that they are Blasphemous
[1:06:29] names all of them all organizations what
[1:06:32] are they blaspheming blasphemy is to be
[1:06:34] contrary to or speak against When God
[1:06:37] says come be born and they say come join
[1:06:40] when baptism of the spirit is falsely
[1:06:42] took over for a wafer in the Catholic
[1:06:45] Church a handshake in the Protestant
[1:06:48] church and an emotion in the Pentecostal
[1:06:50] church instead of the person of Christ
[1:06:52] coming in with all that P pyramid
[1:06:54] building we had the other
[1:06:56] day Okay so there are the
[1:07:01] lodge okay established does God change
[1:07:04] his mind 1965 he says here would be a
[1:07:07] type of the natural and spiritual
[1:07:09] meeting when when the natural and
[1:07:12] spiritual meet there's always a
[1:07:15] collision you want to find where the
[1:07:17] spirit of God is is running against the
[1:07:19] Antichrist Spirit look for the turmoil
[1:07:22] in the church that's right look where
[1:07:24] people get all heated up about it now
[1:07:28] getting heated up about it is a is you
[1:07:31] know you can be be angry and sin not
[1:07:34] okay I'll leave it there but you saw you
[1:07:37] see people in that Clash I don't even
[1:07:39] have to say it you know that Collision
[1:07:44] is the natural and the spiritual meeting
[1:07:46] amen because they run right head on into
[1:07:49] each other I want to represent it as the
[1:07:52] spiritual church Israel here I would I
[1:07:55] want to represent it as a spiritual
[1:07:56] church so he says Israel is a spiritual
[1:07:58] church he says and Moab is the natural
[1:08:01] church just the church what we call
[1:08:04] Church natural we're all sure that there
[1:08:06] is a church and there is a bride coming
[1:08:08] out of that
[1:08:10] church we know that is true and they
[1:08:13] Clash here so when he says Spiritual
[1:08:15] Church he's referring to the bride amen
[1:08:18] and we know and we notice that when they
[1:08:20] clashed here it come under something
[1:08:22] that I would like to speak a moment on
[1:08:25] as soon as they clashed and one seen
[1:08:27] what the other other one was doing there
[1:08:30] was a great
[1:08:33] impersonation that's right one of the
[1:08:36] other so catch from this impersonation
[1:08:38] remember I'm still lay the foundation so
[1:08:40] I hope that we're you're staying with me
[1:08:43] and that's where we find it today that
[1:08:45] we we do get too much
[1:08:48] impersonations and when you do that
[1:08:50] you're always in trouble you but you but
[1:08:53] pause right there
[1:08:55] you cannot impersonate the real thing
[1:08:57] that's right the thing that changes your
[1:08:59] life you can't you can't be impersonated
[1:09:01] because you would have to go then the
[1:09:02] rest of your life bearing the fruits of
[1:09:05] the spirit of Christ without the spirit
[1:09:07] of Christ that's right and you can't do
[1:09:10] that because the fruit you have the seed
[1:09:13] of the fruit you have every that's what
[1:09:15] brother B labored that every seed will
[1:09:17] bring forth of its kind an apple tree
[1:09:20] cannot that's right be a peach tree
[1:09:22] that's right
[1:09:24] you cannot be like Christ amen and you
[1:09:27] can't not be like Christ if the spirit
[1:09:31] of the seed of Christ is in you right
[1:09:35] now I water you water we got a we have a
[1:09:37] peach tree a plum tree an apple tree and
[1:09:41] Cherry they all get the same
[1:09:45] water they all get the same
[1:09:48] water they all have the same dirt they
[1:09:51] all have the same Sun do you see that's
[1:09:54] the Testament that's how I know this is
[1:09:57] a CH tree how do I know it's a oh I can
[1:09:59] look at the leaves and I can study the
[1:10:01] leaves and sure leaves are actually a
[1:10:03] fruit too but I can look at that and and
[1:10:05] and yes but then when the fruit pushes
[1:10:07] out there is no doubts amen so when the
[1:10:12] wind blows there's no fruit on the trees
[1:10:13] and the wind blows and the leaves praise
[1:10:18] God can I tell what's
[1:10:20] what
[1:10:22] no
[1:10:24] no so we have we have taken something
[1:10:27] that we want to see that's it we want to
[1:10:30] feel that's it but there says they
[1:10:33] jumped they couldn't sit and wait for
[1:10:36] God that's right he says so they jumped
[1:10:39] forward that's the and he says they
[1:10:41] committed adultery amen this isn't the
[1:10:45] Baptist Churches this is the message
[1:10:48] church now you're going to go off and
[1:10:49] say oh brother Chris is preaching
[1:10:51] against this church and brother Chris is
[1:10:52] preaching against that church I am not
[1:10:54] at all because guess what I will run the
[1:10:56] brother David's ran the aisles why what
[1:10:58] was it the word amen burned something
[1:11:02] inside of your heart amen so you'll
[1:11:05] express sometimes exactly like the the
[1:11:08] person that lays out in the spirit EXA
[1:11:11] but what is the fruits that's it that's
[1:11:14] it so therefore if you're bearing the
[1:11:16] fruit of Christ you're feeding on that's
[1:11:18] right Christ that's right amen
[1:11:21] absolutely right that's it
[1:11:25] okay so the natural spiritual church he
[1:11:28] says a spiritual church is Israel Moab
[1:11:30] is a natural Church in this context that
[1:11:32] he's
[1:11:36] taking and we're all sure that there was
[1:11:38] a church and there was a bride coming
[1:11:40] out of that church we know that is true
[1:11:43] and they Clash here and we notice that
[1:11:45] when they clashed here it come under
[1:11:48] something that I would like to speak a
[1:11:50] moment on as soon as they clashed okay
[1:11:53] okay I already read all this and when
[1:11:55] you that we do we do get too much
[1:11:58] impersonations and when you do that
[1:12:00] you're always in trouble you cannot live
[1:12:01] the other fellow's life that's right we
[1:12:03] cannot impersonate something we must be
[1:12:06] just what we are amen if this fellow
[1:12:08] does something because he does it you
[1:12:10] think you have to too he says you don't
[1:12:13] do that you're an individual to God and
[1:12:16] we mustn't try to impersonate each
[1:12:20] other amen now the condition of the
[1:12:25] children of
[1:12:26] Israel during the books of the Kings is
[1:12:30] exactly the condition of the last day
[1:12:31] church that's exactly right that's right
[1:12:35] you go and you look at the very
[1:12:37] beginning where did it all start we want
[1:12:39] a king like the
[1:12:41] world okay so if the if the church if
[1:12:44] Israel is the church who are the kings
[1:12:47] that's right the leadership that's right
[1:12:50] Church leadership that's right but you
[1:12:53] you have to have them the God told
[1:12:56] Elijah I have what was it like 10,000
[1:12:58] who refuse to Bow the knee to Baal yet
[1:13:00] Elijah is like I'm the only
[1:13:02] one all through those books when you
[1:13:05] read of the the terrible wickedness of
[1:13:08] Israel there was people serving
[1:13:11] God so but you had to have them to carry
[1:13:15] because the shock carries the
[1:13:18] seed the seed has to have the Shu we
[1:13:20] have to have the people who are
[1:13:22] impersonators amen we have to but one
[1:13:26] day that seed will come out that's
[1:13:28] it we don't want to be the impersonators
[1:13:31] that's okay now let's jump
[1:13:35] into what we want to talk about in First
[1:13:38] Kings chapter
[1:13:45] 11 now we had Saul then God picked a
[1:13:51] king and we had
[1:13:53] David and then Solomon comes up after
[1:13:59] David First Kings 11
[1:14:02] verse4 and it came to pass for it came
[1:14:04] to pass when Solomon was old that his
[1:14:06] wives turned away his heart after other
[1:14:08] gods brother bam says a couple of
[1:14:11] different places the church can turn the
[1:14:14] pastor's heart from God that's right so
[1:14:17] you have a responsibility just as much
[1:14:19] as our pastor and the ministry here has
[1:14:22] you have a resp responsibility to yield
[1:14:25] yourself to the holy spirit amen to
[1:14:27] surrender to Christ and his heart was
[1:14:30] not perfect with the Lord his God as was
[1:14:32] the heart of David his father for
[1:14:35] Solomon went after asaroth the goddess
[1:14:37] of the zidonians and after milom the
[1:14:40] abomination of the ammonites and Solomon
[1:14:43] did evil in the sight of the Lord and
[1:14:44] went not fully after the Lord as did
[1:14:46] David his father then did Solomon build
[1:14:50] an high place for chimos and the the
[1:14:52] Abomination of Moab in the hill that is
[1:14:55] before Jerusalem and for mik the
[1:14:57] abomination of the children of Ammon mik
[1:15:00] whole thing centered around the sacrific
[1:15:03] sacrificing of
[1:15:09] infants and likewise did he for all his
[1:15:11] strange wives which burnt incense and
[1:15:13] sacrificed unto their gods and the Lord
[1:15:16] was angry with Solon because his heart
[1:15:18] was turned from the Lord God of Israel
[1:15:20] which had appeared unto him twice
[1:15:25] now there's a pattern here you'll
[1:15:27] notice Solomon was called of God blessed
[1:15:30] of God with
[1:15:33] wisdom but that doesn't matter that's it
[1:15:37] amen if Solomon turns from the word amen
[1:15:40] you don't follow Solomon that's it Paul
[1:15:43] said whether they be an angel that's it
[1:15:46] or anybody else so in other words what
[1:15:49] is our Compass it's the word of God
[1:15:51] that's right so why and this this this
[1:15:56] just gets me on my
[1:15:58] pedestal never mind I'm not going to go
[1:16:02] there because that's me we want to talk
[1:16:04] about
[1:16:05] God and the Lord was angry with Solomon
[1:16:07] because his heart was turned from the
[1:16:09] Lord God of Israel which had appeared
[1:16:10] unto him twice and he commanded him
[1:16:12] concerning this thing that he should not
[1:16:14] go after other gods but he kept not that
[1:16:17] which the Lord commanded so he knew full
[1:16:20] well what he was doing that's right but
[1:16:22] he was under deception because of the
[1:16:24] women he married the choices that he
[1:16:25] made wherefore the the what he allowed
[1:16:29] you see he
[1:16:32] allowed Lord help us help us in our
[1:16:35] families help us in our church that's
[1:16:37] right that's right to always stand with
[1:16:39] Joshua as for me in my house we will
[1:16:43] serve the
[1:16:44] Lord
[1:16:46] amen okay so now for sake of time God
[1:16:50] raises up adversaries to Solomon be
[1:16:53] because of this departure from the word
[1:16:55] and he he raises up Hadi the Edomite
[1:16:59] and he raises
[1:17:04] up I think
[1:17:06] it's well there's somebody somebody else
[1:17:08] and then he raises up jeroboam now watch
[1:17:11] the story of where jeroboam
[1:17:14] starts verse 26 and jeroboam the son
[1:17:17] nebat that an ephrathite of zerada
[1:17:19] Solomon's servant whose mother's name
[1:17:21] was Zera a wi widow woman even he lifted
[1:17:25] up his hand against the king and this
[1:17:27] was the cause that he lifted up his hand
[1:17:29] against the King Solomon bu built Milow
[1:17:32] and repaired the breaches of the city of
[1:17:34] David his father and the man jeroboam
[1:17:36] was a mighty man of Valor and Solomon
[1:17:38] seeing the young man that he was
[1:17:39] industrious he made him ruler over all
[1:17:41] the charge of the House of Joseph and it
[1:17:43] came to pass at that time when jeroboam
[1:17:46] went out of Jerusalem you know it
[1:17:47] fascinates me that it was the house of
[1:17:49] Joseph because Joseph is the type of
[1:17:51] Christ and it came to pass after at that
[1:17:53] time when jeroboam went out of Jerusalem
[1:17:55] that the prophet ahaja the shilonite
[1:17:58] found him in the way and he had clad
[1:18:00] himself with a new garment and they two
[1:18:01] were alone in the field and thei caught
[1:18:04] the new garment that was on him and
[1:18:05] rinse it in 12 pieces and he said to
[1:18:07] jeroboam take the 10 pieces for thus
[1:18:10] saith the Lord the god of Israel behold
[1:18:12] I will Ren the kingdom out of the hand
[1:18:14] of Solomon and will give 10 tribes to
[1:18:16] thee but he shall have one tribe for my
[1:18:19] servant David's sake so there's already
[1:18:22] One Tribe that has been removed for
[1:18:24] Jerusalem's sake the city which I have
[1:18:26] chosen out of all the tribes of Israel
[1:18:28] okay so jeroboam now he's in his
[1:18:31] position he's going to be a ruler of the
[1:18:33] C City and then the prophet comes and
[1:18:37] prophesies over Jobo Solomon finds out
[1:18:41] so Solomon sets out to kill
[1:18:44] him and Jobo escapes to
[1:18:47] Egypt then Solomon
[1:18:51] dies rabol becomes king all of Israel
[1:18:56] knows the story of jobal knows that
[1:18:59] jobal was anointed king anointed by the
[1:19:02] prophet had the prophecy over him so
[1:19:05] they get jeroboam they say look jeroboam
[1:19:08] Solomon's dead come and it
[1:19:12] says let me find it here because it's
[1:19:21] important
[1:19:24] and it came to
[1:19:26] pass okay this is 12:3 that they sent
[1:19:30] and called him so they called jeroboam
[1:19:32] and jeroboam and all the congregation of
[1:19:35] Israel came and spake unto riab so he's
[1:19:38] already leading at that point Israel is
[1:19:41] looking to him why because he has the
[1:19:43] backing of God Solomon didn't Israel
[1:19:46] knew Solomon
[1:19:48] departed and that that there this whole
[1:19:50] thing happened this whole transition and
[1:19:53] conflict of leadership happened before
[1:19:54] the eyes of Israel they understand
[1:19:57] what's going on now rabo comes up and
[1:20:00] jeroboam they get Jer B Jer B comes and
[1:20:02] addresses the age-old question since the
[1:20:04] dawn of time are you going to lower
[1:20:06] taxes it's still an argument
[1:20:10] today RI
[1:20:12] Bal to jump ahead for time says you
[1:20:16] thought my dad was bad wait till you see
[1:20:18] the taxes I have for you so Jobo the
[1:20:22] Israel said says all it says Israel to
[1:20:24] your tents and the kingdom splits rabom
[1:20:28] jerbo have some conflict and go back and
[1:20:30] forth then ger bone begins to prosper
[1:20:33] why because he's doing the will of God
[1:20:37] God prophesied over him he's fulfilling
[1:20:39] a prophecy on his own life and on the
[1:20:41] life of Solomon because God said Solomon
[1:20:44] you did this so this is Judgment so
[1:20:47] jerob balam anointed call of God hope
[1:20:50] you're catching where we're going with
[1:20:52] this and and and so he begins to
[1:20:55] prosper and he looks at Israel and he
[1:21:04] says now shall the kingdom return to the
[1:21:07] House of David this is in 12: 26-33 if
[1:21:10] this people go up to do sacrifice in the
[1:21:12] house of the Lord at Jerusalem then
[1:21:14] shall the heart of this people turn
[1:21:16] again unto their lord even unto riab
[1:21:19] king of Judah so he gets afraid what is
[1:21:23] he doing he is
[1:21:25] disbelieving the word of
[1:21:29] God that is sin unbelief is
[1:21:32] sin definition of sin is unbelief so
[1:21:35] he's
[1:21:37] disbelieving this portion this word of
[1:21:43] God
[1:21:45] and he says you know what I'm going to
[1:21:49] do something now let's pause right here
[1:21:51] and I'm going to read read from the
[1:21:54] church age book in the Ephesian Church
[1:21:58] age but br's talking about the nicians
[1:22:02] now I want to I want you to pay
[1:22:03] attention here we we put this off and we
[1:22:05] say the nians I understand it's
[1:22:07] Wednesday night and we're we're we're
[1:22:09] only been up here 45 minutes
[1:22:11] so we're good he says he says fean
[1:22:16] Church age he says what are these nians
[1:22:18] the word comes from two Greek words
[1:22:20] niiko which means means to conquer and
[1:22:23] Laos which means the Le in plain fact
[1:22:25] somebody was doing something in that
[1:22:27] early church that was Conquering the Ley
[1:22:30] if the Ley were being conquered then
[1:22:32] there must have been some Authority
[1:22:34] there doing it so
[1:22:36] leadership what was it that God hated
[1:22:38] that was happening in that church what
[1:22:41] was going on then is now going on today
[1:22:44] is exactly what the word nickan means
[1:22:47] the people were being subjected somehow
[1:22:49] in a way that was absolutely contrary to
[1:22:52] to the word of
[1:22:55] God now to get the real meaning of what
[1:22:57] we are about to go into I must caution
[1:23:00] you ever keep in mind that religion
[1:23:02] spiritual matters if you like is
[1:23:04] composed of two parts now two parts
[1:23:06] again he says that entwine but are as
[1:23:10] opposite as black and white religion and
[1:23:13] the spiritual world are made of these
[1:23:15] two trees which have their roots in Eden
[1:23:18] Tree of Life the tree of knowledge of
[1:23:20] Good and Evil so in the midst of the the
[1:23:22] garden he says thus in the Ephesian
[1:23:24] church is is the same is that same
[1:23:27] Paradox the church is made up of good
[1:23:28] and bad two Vines true and false
[1:23:32] okay he will call them the church and
[1:23:35] only the elect will really know which is
[1:23:37] the true Spirit only the elect will not
[1:23:40] be
[1:23:41] deceived he said and he reades scripture
[1:23:44] in Matthew he says so way back there in
[1:23:47] in the early church the false Vine got
[1:23:50] to intertwine itself around the True
[1:23:52] Vine and we find these Deeds of the
[1:23:53] nians and that spirit is going to be
[1:23:55] found fighting the True Vine until it is
[1:23:57] destroyed by God okay now I know that
[1:23:59] was a bit of a of a read there but I
[1:24:01] wanted to bring in that portion of the
[1:24:03] quote there where bam talks about
[1:24:05] nanism so these are men who are in
[1:24:08] leading leadership positions anointed
[1:24:11] you cannot question they that they are
[1:24:14] anointed of God you cannot question that
[1:24:17] they were called of God that's
[1:24:20] right but Paul Bel the point only take
[1:24:26] the word amen amen why does religious
[1:24:29] deception in the church happen because
[1:24:32] we
[1:24:33] disregard the word that's right amen
[1:24:35] that's right that is our holding Point
[1:24:38] that's right not a man not a not not a
[1:24:43] not a worship
[1:24:46] service look if you if you if we could
[1:24:49] take and strip
[1:24:51] away
[1:24:53] I'm going to hold off there like I said
[1:24:55] I've been studying a lot I'm trying to
[1:24:56] keep that for a different time the Lord
[1:24:59] wants it for so Jobo he's in this
[1:25:02] position nobody can question job's
[1:25:05] position but something is about to
[1:25:07] happen that's going to cause Israel to
[1:25:12] fall clear down that's right to where
[1:25:15] they are today amen and it actually
[1:25:18] didn't start with Jobo it started with
[1:25:21] Moab and the east of bpor Amen a spirit
[1:25:24] was introduced
[1:25:26] amen and fought Israel all the way
[1:25:30] through exactly right and where did that
[1:25:32] Spirit come from the days of
[1:25:35] Pentecost Israel was at the River
[1:25:39] Jordan we had you have Egypt the desert
[1:25:43] Fe ofel poror and you have the Jordan
[1:25:45] River that's right you have Luther
[1:25:47] Wesley Pentecost yes sir then you have
[1:25:51] justification sanctification the baptism
[1:25:54] of the Holy Ghost if you cross Jordan so
[1:25:57] right in that season of time right in
[1:26:00] the season of Pentecost what happens the
[1:26:02] Feast of
[1:26:03] bpor causes Israel to turn and what was
[1:26:06] the big thing that caused them to turn
[1:26:09] the music amen that's exactly the music
[1:26:12] caus you go back and you look in the
[1:26:14] history of Music a lot of the music that
[1:26:16] we call rock and roll today started in
[1:26:18] the Pentecostal church amen that's right
[1:26:21] yes sir why was it was a departure from
[1:26:23] the word of God okay like I said another
[1:26:26] thing another time well so that's why we
[1:26:29] are today in the promised land we're
[1:26:33] pursuing Perfection we're pursuing unto
[1:26:36] adoption we can't stop at the foundation
[1:26:39] so
[1:26:39] now
[1:26:42] Jobo makes this departure and he says
[1:26:45] you know what I I'm afraid that if the
[1:26:47] people go down to Israel down to
[1:26:49] Jerusalem to worship they're going to
[1:26:51] stop following me and go after riam so
[1:26:53] now you have two churches fighting
[1:26:55] against each other you've got Ria Bam's
[1:26:58] church and you have job Bam's Church two
[1:27:01] sides of the
[1:27:02] fence and R B said jar B says I'm going
[1:27:05] to model my church after the truth but
[1:27:10] I'm going to build statues to
[1:27:13] bail you see all the way through it was
[1:27:15] always back to bail back to
[1:27:19] bail so he set he he he literally sets
[1:27:23] up one of the high places in bethl amen
[1:27:27] which is what the house of God that's
[1:27:29] right ephra and he puts the other one in
[1:27:32] Dan and that caused Dan's names to be
[1:27:35] blotted from the book why idolatry so
[1:27:39] anytime you take a man's word over the
[1:27:42] word of God you are committing idolatry
[1:27:45] I don't care how good the atmosphere
[1:27:49] feels that's exactly right because if I
[1:27:52] I judged my life on the atmosphere
[1:27:55] that's
[1:27:56] it there's a lot of dead churches that's
[1:27:58] right amen there's a lot of dead
[1:28:01] Christians that's right and that's if
[1:28:03] you get too focused that way that's what
[1:28:05] you start to say and if you get too
[1:28:08] focused on the other side you look at
[1:28:11] anybody who manifests any emotion you
[1:28:13] say oh that's of the devil brother
[1:28:15] brandham constantly does both sides amen
[1:28:18] I told myself I wasn't going to go there
[1:28:20] this service but the point is the
[1:28:22] deception happened when the children of
[1:28:24] Israel said but he's a man of God so
[1:28:28] they took his word over Gods that's it
[1:28:32] do you see it do you see how close it is
[1:28:34] it's a Razor's Edge because they're are
[1:28:38] men of
[1:28:40] God but they took the word into their
[1:28:43] hands and went this
[1:28:46] way now that Spirit goes out there and
[1:28:49] goes far enough down through time
[1:28:51] everyone says oh yes it's obvious but
[1:28:54] when it happens that's it when it
[1:28:56] happens if you're not close with God
[1:28:59] that's it you get caught up in a
[1:29:00] movement that's it when a preacher
[1:29:03] starts to preach to support his movement
[1:29:07] that's it that's a departure from the
[1:29:09] word of God can God bring them back
[1:29:11] around absolutely and he does constantly
[1:29:13] is that to me I got too far one way and
[1:29:16] too far this way and God brings me right
[1:29:18] back right right because it's God we're
[1:29:21] here I'm here to point you to God that
[1:29:24] way if I come back in two months and say
[1:29:26] I was wrong you say that's okay we're
[1:29:28] we're focused on God anyways
[1:29:30] amen and if if Israel knew the word like
[1:29:34] they should have amen when jeroboam said
[1:29:37] look this is what we're going to do
[1:29:38] though it looked like the real thing
[1:29:40] they wouldn't have received
[1:29:42] it and some of them didn't some of them
[1:29:45] didn't God always has his seed on the
[1:29:46] earth to testify that's right
[1:29:49] amen and you watch those those those
[1:29:52] those things that they worshiped was
[1:29:55] mik and chimo mik is the worshiped by
[1:30:00] sacrificing children those are the ones
[1:30:02] who suffer that's it whole you know
[1:30:05] people who have been been in the church
[1:30:07] for years and and and they're they've
[1:30:08] gotten on in their Years or or or they
[1:30:11] or they don't have to be old they can
[1:30:12] just be not not children anymore you
[1:30:15] just keep doing the same thing you know
[1:30:17] when you hit a certain age as an adult
[1:30:19] you just you're okay with doing the same
[1:30:21] thing every day
[1:30:22] makes you happy when you're a kid you're
[1:30:24] like no way man this is boring I'm never
[1:30:26] going to be like that and then 15 years
[1:30:28] later there you
[1:30:29] are and so it's the children who suffer
[1:30:33] that's right watch you want to know what
[1:30:36] a if a spirit of the Church of a church
[1:30:38] is correct look at the children amen and
[1:30:40] the women amen okay that is so mik right
[1:30:45] departure from the word of God we see
[1:30:47] immediately the sacrifice of children
[1:30:50] the next one is chimos which which means
[1:30:52] subduer or
[1:30:54] Bor subduer to bring under control amen
[1:30:59] the spirit of controlling the
[1:31:01] people if you don't act like this you
[1:31:06] don't have it that's it if you act like
[1:31:09] this you don't have
[1:31:11] it what is that that's control that's it
[1:31:14] that's right if you don't wear
[1:31:18] this now we preach modesty
[1:31:23] absolutely
[1:31:24] absolutely but you start to get real
[1:31:27] weird and Technical about it your
[1:31:30] control if you
[1:31:35] have you never know how far to
[1:31:37] go
[1:31:42] sometimes oh if man could completely
[1:31:44] remove himself what God could say that's
[1:31:50] it
[1:31:57] so jobal caused Israel to sin a great
[1:32:01] sin but Israel accepted that
[1:32:04] sin in the Seven
[1:32:13] Seals you know what I did I totally did
[1:32:16] not mark my
[1:32:20] spot
[1:32:24] there it is so he reads about Jobo built
[1:32:27] sheim in Mount infim and and uh and he
[1:32:30] builds these these these Idol worships
[1:32:33] and the Groves and the high places he
[1:32:34] sets these up so brother bam reads this
[1:32:36] in the seventh seal and then he says
[1:32:38] this he says see Ephraim and bethl at
[1:32:40] bethl and Dan they set up idols and
[1:32:43] these people went out there to worship
[1:32:44] these idols and here we are plumbed down
[1:32:46] into the Millennium age almost and God
[1:32:49] still remembered that sin that's right
[1:32:52] they're not even counted in there that's
[1:32:54] right amen glory just as sure as he
[1:32:56] remembers every good promise you see he
[1:32:58] says amen glory you're thinking well
[1:32:59] that's really depressing what you just
[1:33:01] said but what is see a real child of God
[1:33:03] sees that and says wow praise God
[1:33:05] because you know you're on the opposite
[1:33:07] side of that and there's nothing you can
[1:33:09] do to remove your cuz you are you are
[1:33:14] married to the promise he said just as
[1:33:16] sure as he remembers every good promise
[1:33:18] he remembers every evil one too just
[1:33:20] remember that's the reason I believe
[1:33:21] friends I've always tried to stay with
[1:33:23] that word no matter how strange it seems
[1:33:28] that's it the Pinnacle of Paul's
[1:33:30] Ministry was his
[1:33:32] rejection what what what when Paul died
[1:33:35] where were his
[1:33:37] friends he was alone bring me my coat
[1:33:40] and my book that's it he died per se
[1:33:43] with a pen in his hand and nobody there
[1:33:46] oh maybe he had one friend but he didn't
[1:33:48] have this great big
[1:33:50] Ministry he didn't have all these people
[1:33:52] around him Paul died alone but you see
[1:33:55] we are afraid of being alone that's it
[1:33:58] there you are we're afraid of being
[1:34:00] weird that's it I'm not talking about to
[1:34:03] the world we have enough big enough
[1:34:05] community in the message where we have a
[1:34:08] world to
[1:34:10] but but we're afraid to be weird at at
[1:34:14] camps we're afraid to be weird when we
[1:34:16] go visit people or or in the church
[1:34:19] itself because what if calls you to a
[1:34:22] this is the whole point tonight God I
[1:34:24] want go I want the message to come
[1:34:26] across tonight that God is calling us to
[1:34:27] a higher Place let's step it up amen
[1:34:31] step up the game we're done with status
[1:34:33] quo are you ready to surrender are you
[1:34:36] ready to give it up amen I'm talking
[1:34:39] about the things that the message
[1:34:41] Believers amen say are okay amen I'm not
[1:34:45] going to get technical about different
[1:34:46] things the other I'm talking about are
[1:34:49] you consecrating your life that's it I
[1:34:51] had I I'm going to preach this tonight I
[1:34:53] had a moment in my office and I said
[1:34:55] God I'm ready to go all the way amen God
[1:34:59] has dealt me with and I'm going to be
[1:35:00] very blunt tonight God has dealt with me
[1:35:02] point blank on music amen and it was a
[1:35:05] hard part to walk I repented to my
[1:35:08] family you know what I Repent to you
[1:35:10] praise the Lord that's good the Lord
[1:35:13] because and there's and Lord willing you
[1:35:15] know what if the pastor allows it maybe
[1:35:17] we'll we'll we'll talk about that
[1:35:18] sometime amen
[1:35:20] but
[1:35:22] I and I'm just going to testify I have
[1:35:24] for the last few months because God
[1:35:26] pushes you to positions when he's ready
[1:35:28] for you to move higher okay God pushes
[1:35:31] you into a position a place where things
[1:35:34] are a certain way right there's no more
[1:35:36] fluff in the
[1:35:37] nest because he wants you to look around
[1:35:40] and say something's not right says he
[1:35:43] wants to call you higher up
[1:35:45] amen so we want to provoke unto good
[1:35:49] works go up with your position I started
[1:35:51] to deal with a temper I haven't dealt
[1:35:53] with since I was a little kid when I was
[1:35:55] a little kid I went up to my dad CU I
[1:35:57] heard brother bam say it and I told my
[1:35:59] dad I got a temper that can fight a buz
[1:36:01] saw trying to make a joke he looked at
[1:36:03] me he says you need to pray God delivers
[1:36:05] you from that amen and I did and God
[1:36:07] took it from me now remember a temper is
[1:36:09] part of humanity God gives you the
[1:36:12] ability to control it he doesn't take it
[1:36:14] from you be too
[1:36:17] easy well that in the past few months
[1:36:20] flared up and I was having I was having
[1:36:23] terrible points of Rage with people with
[1:36:27] my wife my kids I mean I would C I would
[1:36:30] catch it I would just be I would be feel
[1:36:32] terrible would repent to them and say
[1:36:34] guys I'm sorry I went for prayer felt
[1:36:37] led to go for prayer and I said I
[1:36:39] believe that's that's going to go away
[1:36:40] and everything and I'm just dealing with
[1:36:42] this confronting this every day God I
[1:36:44] need this can't be I can't get up there
[1:36:47] and preach and then walk off the
[1:36:48] platform and yell and scream at my
[1:36:50] family that is not the spirit of Christ
[1:36:52] that's
[1:36:53] right God and then God confronted me
[1:36:56] with the music we've been listening to I
[1:37:00] removed it from my life and guess what
[1:37:02] that temper is gone praise the Lord that
[1:37:06] the anointing of that Christian music
[1:37:09] was stirring up attention inside of my
[1:37:12] spirit because I am a child of Godly so
[1:37:16] what spirit is inside of me the spirit
[1:37:18] of Christ and that if I'm feeding the
[1:37:20] spirit of the flesh that's right the
[1:37:23] spirit of the flesh is going to rain
[1:37:25] that's it that's it that's exactly right
[1:37:28] so now I will listen to what I would
[1:37:30] have called before old people music
[1:37:32] praise the
[1:37:33] Lord but you know what God's always
[1:37:36] right here amen and I I was struggling
[1:37:40] God why aren't you right here anymore
[1:37:41] what's wrong why are you not right
[1:37:45] here because I was anointing myself with
[1:37:48] the wrong Spirit that's right because
[1:37:50] when if you're musician you guess what
[1:37:52] you do you listen to music all the time
[1:37:55] all the
[1:37:57] time and my started me and my wife both
[1:37:59] my wife just started to be tired of our
[1:38:01] music what's we don't like this anymore
[1:38:03] what's wrong we're not enjoying this
[1:38:05] this is we need new music or something
[1:38:08] what's going on and I look it wasn't you
[1:38:11] know it
[1:38:12] wasn't here's the crazy part it wasn't
[1:38:14] what people would call Rocky music per
[1:38:17] se it was it's it was the AC it's the
[1:38:19] accepted music of the message it's the
[1:38:22] accepted music you see people singing
[1:38:24] from the platform that's right but God
[1:38:27] showed me the spirit behind that that's
[1:38:29] why I said what I said about Pentecost
[1:38:31] back in the day you go and look at some
[1:38:33] of the modern rock and roll beats and
[1:38:35] music came from the Pentecostal Church
[1:38:38] yes sir well where did the Feast of B
[1:38:40] pure happen that's it right around the
[1:38:42] season of Pentecost okay so the pastor
[1:38:45] is away but that is from Brother Chris's
[1:38:49] heart that is my
[1:38:51] testimony amen you just receive what you
[1:38:55] want and God will take care of
[1:38:57] everything that's good but I had to just
[1:38:59] share that with you so I want to just
[1:39:03] hit this real quick in
[1:39:07] closing the re the reason Israel
[1:39:11] followed
[1:39:13] jobal is because they had
[1:39:16] institutionalized the
[1:39:19] gospel that's it institutionalized by
[1:39:22] definition isn't established in practice
[1:39:24] or custom established as part of an
[1:39:27] official
[1:39:29] organization and it when it's of a
[1:39:31] person an institutionalized person that
[1:39:33] person is apathetic and dependent after
[1:39:37] a long period in an institution that's
[1:39:41] exactly right I'm here tonight to say
[1:39:43] that we
[1:39:44] have God forgive us we have
[1:39:48] institutionalized that's it the message
[1:39:50] of the hour right we have created a
[1:39:53] culture and a custom that's it around
[1:39:56] what we call the
[1:39:59] message and you know what happens when
[1:40:01] someone is
[1:40:02] institutionalized they become apathetic
[1:40:05] do you know what the definition of
[1:40:06] apathetic is showing or feeling no
[1:40:10] interest that's it enthusiasm or
[1:40:13] concern amen enthusiasm is not
[1:40:18] this enthusiasm is a passion
[1:40:21] that's right that pushes when it's
[1:40:23] raining when it's cloudy when you're
[1:40:25] tired pushes through because you have an
[1:40:27] enthusiasm for the word of God amen amen
[1:40:31] exactly an interest is not I want to
[1:40:35] play the piano I want to sing a song
[1:40:37] that is not that is part of the
[1:40:40] institution because you want to be
[1:40:42] accepted by the club that's it that's
[1:40:46] good but in order for you to take the
[1:40:48] next step up in the Statue of a perfect
[1:40:50] man to come come unto adoption you have
[1:40:52] to walk that road
[1:40:56] alone it is you and God exactly right
[1:40:59] and that is it no church will carry you
[1:41:02] there we won't even carry you there I'm
[1:41:05] not going to get up here and tell you
[1:41:06] you're a Son of God you're a Son of God
[1:41:07] you're a Son of God no I want you to
[1:41:09] find that out for yourself amen amen
[1:41:12] that's if we get up here and we preach
[1:41:13] now it's going to sound like I'm
[1:41:15] preaching against people but I am not no
[1:41:17] sir I'm preaching against the spirit if
[1:41:18] we get up and we just preach how perfect
[1:41:21] you are and how you're the bride of
[1:41:22] Christ you will never do anything to
[1:41:24] change your position amen because the
[1:41:26] preacher told you who you are I want God
[1:41:29] to tell you who you are I want God to
[1:41:32] meet you somewhere and say look
[1:41:34] Gabriella I'm Christ and you say oh I
[1:41:38] see you
[1:41:39] now because in that moment you can't
[1:41:43] describe it amen well this happened and
[1:41:46] you'll describe but you can't tell me
[1:41:49] exactly what happened that's exactly you
[1:41:51] just know you started to
[1:41:52] change something in your life demanded
[1:41:55] more time with God Amen why it was a
[1:41:57] spirit of God but if I give you the the
[1:42:01] the description and the visual of what
[1:42:03] the power of God moving in your life is
[1:42:07] you will manufacture it yes sir that's
[1:42:10] exactly right yes
[1:42:13] sir and then what is
[1:42:15] it idolatry that's exactly
[1:42:19] what those you do it in the name of God
[1:42:22] though you do it in the Name of
[1:42:25] Christ so Lord help us not to try to
[1:42:29] describe it that's exactly let us preach
[1:42:32] a gospel amen the gospel of Liberty amen
[1:42:37] the gospel of Christ where you can find
[1:42:39] Christ if I get up here and I preach my
[1:42:41] opinion to support my position you
[1:42:44] receive no Christ that's it though it's
[1:42:46] coded in the message if I get up here
[1:42:49] and I preach to you message taglines and
[1:42:52] I tell you how you're the bride and how
[1:42:54] you're going to overcome but I don't
[1:42:56] give you any word to overcome with
[1:42:58] that's right I have failed you oh you
[1:43:00] will be excited that's it if I started
[1:43:03] to tell Gideon bro you're ripped you're
[1:43:06] strong you're buff and he
[1:43:09] wasn't you know how weird that would be
[1:43:12] he goes around thinking he's something
[1:43:13] guess what he'll stop doing he won't
[1:43:14] lift
[1:43:16] weights he won't go to the gym because
[1:43:19] he's already made it you see what
[1:43:21] happens when we just preach you to a
[1:43:22] position you have not yet attained
[1:43:24] that's it then you walk away you walk
[1:43:27] out of the camp beating you walk away
[1:43:28] from church you walk away from meetings
[1:43:32] thinking you've arrived that's exactly
[1:43:34] right and you haven't amen so let us
[1:43:37] preach the gospel of Christ that is our
[1:43:39] duty that's right that is our mission
[1:43:42] and that should be your mission too God
[1:43:44] where are you that's what Gideon said
[1:43:46] Gideon said where be all the Miracles in
[1:43:50] other words
[1:43:52] not broken arms healed no where be the
[1:43:56] manifestation that's it of God because
[1:43:58] he says that's where I'll find God
[1:44:01] that's
[1:44:02] it where is God
[1:44:04] Amen if you have some kind of mental
[1:44:07] conception of who and what God looks
[1:44:10] like you've missed the
[1:44:13] point if you have a mental idea of of
[1:44:15] what the of a good worship service looks
[1:44:18] like or a good preaching service looks
[1:44:20] like you have missed the point
[1:44:23] amen you shouldn't be looking to the
[1:44:25] person next to you to see how you should
[1:44:27] react to the word that's it that's just
[1:44:30] what brother baram said not to do don't
[1:44:31] impersonate somebody so what can we do
[1:44:36] then the best thing I ever
[1:44:39] heard from a man of God who was
[1:44:41] mentoring me in my Ministry he says you
[1:44:44] can tell the people what's wrong but
[1:44:46] don't leave them
[1:44:47] there that's what's wrong but there's
[1:44:50] always always a solution to a word
[1:44:52] problem what can we do then Christ is
[1:44:54] the mystery of God reveal I love it when
[1:44:56] you ask somebody a question and they
[1:44:58] respond with a quote in scripture yes
[1:45:01] sir look Christ in you makes him the
[1:45:03] center of life of the Revelation
[1:45:06] life something when I was in Ohio I just
[1:45:09] had God provided such a good
[1:45:11] opportunities I I only actually only
[1:45:13] preached four services but God provided
[1:45:15] such an opportunity for me to fellowship
[1:45:17] and take in other services and really
[1:45:19] spoke with my heart
[1:45:21] and he just sealed this you know you
[1:45:23] hear something over and over again you
[1:45:25] think you know it but then you catch a
[1:45:26] revelation of it that's you can have an
[1:45:30] intellectual knowledge sir of the
[1:45:32] Revelation do you know what that means
[1:45:34] you know how to describe it that's it
[1:45:38] but you don't know it that's it that's
[1:45:40] exactly you know the seals you can talk
[1:45:42] about them but you don't know Christ
[1:45:44] right do you realize how deceptive that
[1:45:47] is that's when someone has a knowledge
[1:45:50] of the Revelation but not actually the
[1:45:53] Revelation that's it that's right he
[1:45:56] says Christ in you makes him the center
[1:45:58] of the life of the Revelation not the
[1:46:01] knowledge the life of the Revelation see
[1:46:04] Christ's life in you makes him the
[1:46:06] center of the
[1:46:08] Revelation Christ's life in you makes
[1:46:11] him the center of the Revelation
[1:46:15] amen Christ in the Bible and I know this
[1:46:19] is not this is a very familiar quote
[1:46:21] Christ in the Bible makes the Bible the
[1:46:24] complete revelation of Christ you say
[1:46:27] brother Chris that's not what we asked
[1:46:30] we asked what can we
[1:46:32] do are you
[1:46:35] listening Christ in the Bible makes the
[1:46:38] Bible the complete revelation of Christ
[1:46:41] Christ in you that's it makes you the
[1:46:44] complete revelation of the whole thing
[1:46:47] that's it see what God is trying to to
[1:46:50] do that is what you need to do that is
[1:46:53] how you overcome the religious deception
[1:46:55] in the church Christ in you he says what
[1:46:59] is the new birth then he'd say well
[1:47:01] brother brandom what is the new
[1:47:04] birth ask somebody to describe that to
[1:47:07] you
[1:47:07] too say tell me what happens what does
[1:47:11] the person do how do I
[1:47:13] know a true Son of God always will
[1:47:16] respond with well it's the fruits they
[1:47:19] bear line with the word of God they do
[1:47:21] the word of God they say Amen to the
[1:47:23] word of God
[1:47:25] absolutely but if we're not careful we
[1:47:28] major on an outward
[1:47:31] expression that's the danger of it you
[1:47:34] can you can believe it the right way but
[1:47:35] are you expressing that to the world am
[1:47:38] or are you caught up in looking like
[1:47:40] your
[1:47:41] brother or caught up in being part of a
[1:47:46] group look the scripture says the tears
[1:47:49] and the wheat have to be separated amen
[1:47:53] that is in the message churches so don't
[1:47:58] look for that conflict to end that's it
[1:48:02] it won't that's right don't pick
[1:48:06] sides no that's
[1:48:09] right pick the middle of the road that's
[1:48:12] right the razor's Edge Walk The
[1:48:16] Edge you ever see a tight rope Walker Oh
[1:48:20] is he here's here's this TI Rob Walker
[1:48:23] you know he uses to balance both sides
[1:48:26] amen amen he holds a long pole that's
[1:48:28] weighted and it both sides B bow down
[1:48:32] and push him so he's centered and he
[1:48:34] walks that's right we have to have the
[1:48:37] Fanatics and we have to have the dead
[1:48:40] stale bread you have
[1:48:44] to because there would be no middle
[1:48:47] otherwise so don't get over here because
[1:48:50] if you get over here and if you look
[1:48:52] this way and start to point your finger
[1:48:55] at them you lose balance and fall that
[1:48:57] way amen if you turn this way and start
[1:48:59] to point at them you lose balance and
[1:49:01] fall that way amen but if you say I'm
[1:49:05] going to focus on Christ amen that's it
[1:49:08] then you you walk the line you get to
[1:49:12] the other
[1:49:14] side do you do you realize this is this
[1:49:17] actually frees you up this lifts a
[1:49:19] burden off your shoulders amen that's
[1:49:21] exactly because you don't have to worry
[1:49:23] about it now amen you just say well I'm
[1:49:26] going to know what the real dollar looks
[1:49:28] like don't just take my word for it take
[1:49:32] it and run it through the scriptures run
[1:49:33] it through the message that's right
[1:49:35] that's right please amen do that amen
[1:49:39] some preachers are scared of that that's
[1:49:41] right well that's because they're
[1:49:42] preaching their opinion that's it what
[1:49:45] is the new birth then you say it is
[1:49:47] revelation of Jesus Christ personally to
[1:49:50] to you amen amen see not you joined a
[1:49:53] church you shook a hand you done
[1:49:54] something different you set a Creed you
[1:49:56] promised to live by a code of rules but
[1:49:58] Christ the Bible he is the word that was
[1:50:01] revealed to
[1:50:03] you and no matter what anybody says what
[1:50:06] takes place it's Christ amen that's it
[1:50:09] Pastor priest whatever it might be it's
[1:50:12] Christ in you amen that is the
[1:50:14] Revelation that the church was built
[1:50:16] upon amen amen you say I need victory in
[1:50:19] my life
[1:50:20] that's it go back to the book that's it
[1:50:23] your name's written there anyways amen
[1:50:25] that seven seal book of redemption is
[1:50:27] none other than the scriptures that's it
[1:50:30] this is your book of redemption and your
[1:50:32] name is written there amen have you
[1:50:34] found it
[1:50:37] yet yes sir Revelations 10:8 in closing
[1:50:41] and the voice which I heard from Heaven
[1:50:42] spake unto me again and said go and
[1:50:44] shout and dance about no go and sit
[1:50:47] quietly in the corner no go and and take
[1:50:50] the little book that's it which was open
[1:50:52] in the hand of the Angel which standeth
[1:50:55] upon the sea and upon the
[1:50:57] Earth and I went unto the angel and said
[1:51:00] unto him give me the little book and he
[1:51:02] said unto me take it and eat it up and
[1:51:05] it shall make thy belly bitter but it
[1:51:08] shall be in thy mouth sweet as honey so
[1:51:10] it tastes really really
[1:51:14] good but then when you live it it's
[1:51:17] really bitter that's it why because it's
[1:51:20] hard if it can't be
[1:51:23] easy you know and I know we've been long
[1:51:26] but I can tell I know we've been long so
[1:51:29] you
[1:51:31] just allow me to say a couple
[1:51:36] things Church shouldn't be so
[1:51:39] easy now I have to Define that
[1:51:44] because there's always there's got to be
[1:51:46] something that's pushing you up that's
[1:51:49] got to be something that's that's moving
[1:51:51] in your spirit something that that's
[1:51:52] calling you higher up if we've all just
[1:51:54] found this place where we're happy and
[1:51:56] we're in agreement that's right that's
[1:51:59] what are we agreeing on that's good are
[1:52:01] we agreeing on the word because if we're
[1:52:02] agreeing on the word guess what we're
[1:52:04] going to have iron sharpening
[1:52:06] iron we're going to have conversation
[1:52:08] we're going to have Fellowship around
[1:52:09] the word of God but if we've all just
[1:52:11] accepted a a culture that's what I mean
[1:52:14] by easy if we all just accept a culture
[1:52:17] I'm talking about Grace Tabernacle if we
[1:52:20] all just accept a culture this is how it
[1:52:21] is and we don't check the word that's it
[1:52:24] right there it is that's good we will
[1:52:27] depart that's exactly right I'm not
[1:52:30] saying something is wrong no sir you're
[1:52:33] right not at all exactly but apathy
[1:52:35] comes from when we become accepted exact
[1:52:38] in a culture that's exactly right we
[1:52:41] call Public Schools institutions for a
[1:52:45] reason everybody has to find their group
[1:52:48] they fit in and then that that's it
[1:52:50] that's high
[1:52:51] school that that's in the church okay
[1:52:55] and we have to constantly push against
[1:52:58] it the word has to be applied to every
[1:53:02] individual amen amen I don't care who
[1:53:04] they are amen the word is the word
[1:53:08] amen go home and make sure brother Chris
[1:53:13] Brother David brother the Paul that's
[1:53:17] it the trustees the deacons that's it
[1:53:21] make sure it all lines up with the word
[1:53:22] of God right that's exactly right that's
[1:53:26] how we will stay a strong church that's
[1:53:29] how we'll keep the spirit of God out we
[1:53:32] don't we don't pick an individual base
[1:53:34] because because somebody recommended
[1:53:37] them or because of who they are we
[1:53:38] picked them based on the word of
[1:53:40] God that's exactly right that is where
[1:53:43] we find our balance we won't find it
[1:53:46] outside of that everything will just be
[1:53:48] a club that's it you know what a club is
[1:53:51] everybody agrees with each other y so
[1:53:54] there's no growth how do they get growth
[1:53:56] they bring an
[1:53:58] outsider at my job I work at we bring
[1:54:01] Outsiders to tell us and when new people
[1:54:03] come in we say tell us what's wrong
[1:54:05] because when you're new you see it
[1:54:07] all so he said and I take the little
[1:54:10] book out of the Angel's hand and ate it
[1:54:11] up and it was in my mouth sweet as honey
[1:54:13] and as soon as I had eaten it my belly
[1:54:15] was bitter that is the answer to what
[1:54:17] you can do let's bow our head
[1:54:20] amen Heavenly Father Lord Jesus we just
[1:54:23] thank you so much for your presence here
[1:54:26] tonight Lord we ask you that you would
[1:54:30] just continue to lead us Lord as we
[1:54:33] yield our hearts and our lives into your
[1:54:35] hands Lord You Are The Potter therefore
[1:54:38] you know the clay there's different
[1:54:40] types of clay from what I understand the
[1:54:43] Potter knows how to work them in their
[1:54:45] way you know how much water to use and
[1:54:48] how much fire to use and how much speed
[1:54:50] on the wheel when to bake them how long
[1:54:53] they must sit and
[1:54:54] dry God help us to trust in you not in a
[1:54:59] man not in an idea not in a church
[1:55:02] doctrine not in a culture but to trust
[1:55:05] in you amen because you know us because
[1:55:09] you created us and Lord we want to be
[1:55:12] vessels set aside that you could use we
[1:55:17] want to be vessels put to use we want to
[1:55:20] come to adoption we want to embrace the
[1:55:23] next step of virtue and knowledge and
[1:55:25] Temperance and and brotherly kindness
[1:55:28] and and and and all of those steps up to
[1:55:31] Divine love which is
[1:55:35] Christ help us God to
[1:55:38] depart from our ideas that's it of what
[1:55:42] it means to be a Christian and to Define
[1:55:46] that position based on the word of God
[1:55:50] amen
[1:55:52] amen thank you Lord Jesus amen thank you
[1:55:57] Lord Jesus Christ's name we pray
[1:56:00] amen coincidentally not coincidentally
[1:56:04] when Victor Leo gave his or he was The
[1:56:08] Interpreter when the young man gave his
[1:56:11] his prophecy over brother Brandon which
[1:56:12] is one of the one of the last big things
[1:56:14] like that it said it ended in Victory in
[1:56:19] love
[1:56:21] divine thank you Danny Henry the
[1:56:23] prophecy ends victory in Divine love
[1:56:27] that's it that's it is in other words
[1:56:30] that's the point
[1:56:33] amen because Divine love is Christ
