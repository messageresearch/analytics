make him mad to be afraid of the devils to be against the will of god we are not called to be afraid amen but to stand in the power that christ has given us and why don't we stand tonight praise the lord it's always good to be in the house of god amen matthew chapter 25 is where we'll start tonight matthew 25 verse 1. then shall the kingdom of heaven be likened unto ten virgins which took their lamps and went forth to meet the bridegroom and five of them were wise and five were foolish and they that were foolish took their lamps and took no oil with them but the wise took oil in their vessels with their lamps while the bridegroom tarried they all slumbered and slept and at midnight there was a cry made behold the bridegroom cometh go you out to meet him then all those virgins arose and trimmed their lamps and the foolish said unto the wise give us of your oil for our lamps are gone out but the wise answered saying not so lest there not be enough for us and you but go you rather to them that sell and buy for yourselves while they went to ba to buy the bridegroom came and they that were ready went in with him to the marriage and the door was shut amen and then matthew 6 verse 6 i just have it written here but thou when thou prayest enter into thy closet and when thou has shut thy door pray to thy father which is in secret and thy father which seeth in secrets shall reward thee openly let's bow our heads heavenly father lord jesus we asked lord that you would come father and keep your word tonight lord jesus father we are here gathered in your name lord ready to hear from you whether ready to be touched by you father lord may not the stumblings and the stutters of this man get in the way tonight but father you just come and speak to our hearts lord father if we come tonight and we only hear a man speak and we go away from here father will not be any better but lord if you come and you speak father we'll go from here changed lord jesus i pray father that you would anoint these words tonight anoint the hearts of your children father lord of your bride lord your sweet heart father lord and remind us again tonight father lord all about the goodness that you have done for us for remind us again tonight father of all the goodness you have in store for us father may we remember who we are lord we listen to the voice of the world every day father for that is where we live and lord it tries to tell us and bring us down we are not nothing special but lord the word pushes back against that and father we want to be reminded tonight of how much you love us father lord and how much father our life means so much more than our daily life here on this earth father may you just come tonight we pray in jesus name amen you may have your seats tonight so my title tonight is behind a closed door now i um last time i spoke we talked about thomas and what wasn't in my notes it was inspiration of the holy spirit that we saw that the door was shut but jesus came inside anyways and behind that closed door he turned thomas's doubts into revelation and i just kept thinking about that i couldn't get that out of my head and uh brother david was preaching last wednesday and just the notes coming out felt bad i was hoping no one thought i was texting so all i had was my phone so i was taking notes on my phone but as brother david knows and uncle paul if you don't write it down you will not remember it so we were there and then sunday morning our pastor opened up and now i couldn't i couldn't believe what what he was preaching on and um we're going to pick up literally in the next verse where he stopped and that's just the goodness of god and as the kind of stuff my god does and you can't plan that because we didn't swap notes but if we turn in john 20 let's just refresh our memories on thomas john chapter 20 verse 26. and after eight days again his disciples were with were within and thomas with them and then came jesus the doors being shut and stood in the midst and said peace be unto you then saith he to thomas reach hither thy finger and behold my hands and reach hither thy hand and thrust it into my side and be not faithless but believing and thomas answered and said unto him my lord and my god amen so thomas's doubts return to revelation behind a closed door amen so now let's step forward into second kings chapter four amen we heard on sunday about the the um the sister with the pots she had no money to pay what was due and her sons are going to be taken from her to be servants to pay her debt and she goes to the prophet elisha the word and the word told her to get all the pot she could and to just pour the oil not to worry about where it was coming from or how much was in the bottle but just to pour the oil sometimes god asks us to do things that don't necessarily make sense but if we do them we'll find god's promise fulfilled in those actions because your actions testify of your faith that god is going to cover your back amen second kings chapter four see here amen six five four okay second kings chapter four and uh verse seven is where the she she comes and she tells the man of god go and he said go sell the oil and pay thy debt and live thou and thy children of the rest i just it just moved me to see that we ended there on sunday and we're picking up in verse eight to nine this is how god works sometimes so verse eight and it fell on a day that elisha passed to shut him there was a great woman and she constrained him to eat bread and so it was that as oft as he passed by he turned in thither to eat bread she must have made a good bread maker and she said under her husband behold now i perceive that this is an holy man of god which passes passeth by us continually so they didn't necessarily know who he was when he first started coming around amen but they began to realize by his his manners and how he conducted himself and what he talked about that this guy was a man of god and she says let us make a little chamber i pray thee on the wall and let us set for him there a bed and a table and a stool and a candlestick and it shall be when he cometh to us that he shall turn in thither and it fell on the day that he came thither and he turned into the chamber and lay there and he said the gehesa his servant called this shinumhai and when he had called her she stood before him and he said unto her say now unto her and um behold thou has been careful for us with all this care what is to be done for thee what is thou be spoken for to the king or to the captain of the host and she answered i dwell among my unknown people and he said what then is to be done for her and gaheza answered verily she hath no child and her husband is old and he said call her and when he had called her she stood in the door so elisha sent kahesa to talk to her geheza comes back and tells him what she said and gaza knew that she had no child and her husband was getting old and so he said now go bring her to me so she she comes and he says and when he had called her she stood in the door and he said about this season according to the time of life thou shalt embrace his son and she said name my lord thou man of god do not lie unto thine handmaid and the woman conceived and bear a son at that season that elisha had said unto her according to the time of life so she didn't have the faith to believe it but the word had spoken amen you didn't necessarily have the faith to accept god's word but the word was spoken over you before the foundation of the world and there would become a time in this right season where you would bring forth amen that promised son amen and that is a testimony to the life of christ inside of you that's what the whole thing's about is you receiving seed from your husband jesus christ and then bringing forth the promised son amen which is the word of god amen your life will testify of it and so now uh verse 18 and when the child was grown it fell on a day that he went out to his father to the reapers and he said unto his father my head my head and he said to a lad carry him to his mother so we speculate he had got a heat stroke and when he had taken him and brought him to his mother he sat on her knee till noon and then died and she went up and laid him on the bed of the man of god and shut the door upon him and went out immediately she took her concerns her worries and laid them on the resting place of god's word amen and that resting place is the faith that god will keep his promises god promised her a son and the devil tried to take it away but she knew this was a promise from god so straight away she puts him in the bed she saddles up the donkey and she called her husband verse 22 and said send me i pray thee one of the young men and one of the asses that i may run to the man of god and come again and he said wherefore will thou go to him today it is neither new moon nor sabbath and she said it shall be well praise the lord her son's lame are dead but her testimony says it shall be well amen revelations it says they overcame him by the blood of the lamb and by the word of your testimony praise the lord and he said wherefore okay twenty-four then she sat on an ass and said to her servant drive and go forward slack not thy writing for me except i bid thee in other words go as fast as you can don't worry about me hang on so she went and came under the man of god to mount carmel and it came to pass when the man of god saw her afar off that he said to geheza his servant behold yonder is that shinomite run now i pray thee to meet her and say unto her is it well with thee is it well with thy husband is it well with the child and she answered it as well well the he didn't know why she was coming god had hid it from him and when she came to the man of god to the hill she caught him by the feet but geheza came near to thrust her away and the man of god said let her alone for her soul is vexed within her and the lord hath hid it from me and hath not told me then she said that did i desire a son of my lord did i not say do not deceive me amen i got a little note written in my bible here holding god to his promise amen sometimes you gotta hold god to his promise that's what he's looking for he's looking do you actually believe the promise that i have given you are you willing to say cry jesus you promised me he says are they are they are they're just gonna accept defeat and walk away but not the children of god you can't accept defeat you have to stand on the word when you say lord you promised you're not being arrogant you're saying you have faith you have faith that what god said he will do he's going to fulfill in your life and that's exactly what she was doing say hey you promised me a son i had that son but now he's dead did not you promised me a son amen she's holding the word of god to the promise then he said to gahesa gird up thy loins and take my staff in thine hand and go thy way if thou meet any man salute him not if any salute thee answer him not again and lay my staff upon the face of the child i mean just like the handkerchief that paul and we've we've done now and um the mother of the child said as the lord liveth and as thy soul liveth i will not leave thee and he arose and followed her so she was like that she was like that woman that kept knocking on the judge's door she didn't stop right she said that's fine gaheza can go with his staff but i'm going to stay with you and that's what you got to do when something happens calamity happens in your life or you just need god to come and answer a prayer stay with him stay right there with him and then don't accept a substitute amen and passed on before them and laid the staff upon the face of the child but there was neither voice nor hearing wherefore he went again to meet him and told him saying the child is not awake and when elijah was come into the house behold the child was dead and laid upon his bed he went in therefore and shut the door upon them twain amen behind a closed door as their title tonight so he shuts the door and and and prayed unto the lord and he went up and lay upon the child and put his mouth upon his mouth and his eyes upon his eyes and his mouth hands upon his hands and he stretched himself upon the child and the flesh of the child waxed warm then he returned and walked in the house to and fro and went up and stretched himself upon him and the child sneezed seven times and the child opened his eyes and he called geheza and said call the shinami so he called her and when she was come in unto him he said take up thy son then she went in and fell at his feet and bowed herself to the ground and took up her son and went out amen so here he had so here's elijah comes he's behind the closed door we see the promised son brought back to life amen and given to the shenanigans the promised word amen and though it looked like amen in the in the in the first church age oh look like the word went down for good amen it was just seven times over amen and the seventh time and we brought the promised son back to us so you are in the place of the shunammite woman tonight you're standing there with your promised son amen given to you amen amen and you received that revelation you received that promise brought back to life behind the closed door father available he says the the the earth knew it was him it shook with the great earthquake when he died the moon and sun hid their face the very creator of them was dying on calvary sorry i sent this quote after i already sent alex all my notes so i don't know if he got it or not but the very creator of them was dying on calvary the sun went out in the middle of the day i seen him go right on down to the doors of hell oh i feel religious tonight look brother i seen i know what i'm talking about i'm not lost in the fog no sir i know right where i'm standing yes sir and he descended right on down into the lower regions of hell knocked on the door satan comes said who's there said open up who are you open up satan opens up and says oh so you finally arrived did you said i thought i had you when i killed abel when i throw daniel in the lines then i thought i got you i thought i got you when i put the hebrew children in the fiery furnace when i beheaded john the baptist i thought i had you but now i got you you're here you arrived did you satan said jesus give me the keys of death and hell you don't possess them oh yes i do i possess them because back yonder in the garden of eden adam's sin but he said i'm the virgin born son of god i come down from the father's bosom i've just died yonder on calvary and my blood's still dripping from the cross i come down to take over that's right you ain't scaring nobody from this you was a bluff one time you had them but you haven't got them anymore i'm the possessor that's right i'll give my church the keys to the kingdom reached over on his side and pulled the keys off of him smacked him in the face sent him back and shut the door so hard it shook the pegs of hell in his eyes hallelujah hey man that's a good one to just poke on your wall every once in a while and you start feeling like you got the wowzy wowzy woo he made this a reminder that the the lord took all the power from satan and then slammed the door in his face amen and so the the door was shut amen um on elisha and the child and brought victory over death when jesus went down to the pits of hell he shut the door on the devil and then he brought victory over death to you amen and then at the same time he opened the door with the renting of the holiest holy the veil over the holiest holies he opened that door to now whosoever will let him come amen so the door has been opened for you to receive christ but now watch you have to you have to take the step into there but the door can't stay open the door has to be closed amen and the work that he'll do with his bride amen will be behind the closed door amen we know that to be the truth in the message that we read it amen that christ is is beckoning you to come he opened the door now anybody can come but see not everybody is going to come only those elected few because they have something in their heart that says you know what i need to go inside there with christ amen and receive seed to bring forth the promised son to bring victory over what your death every single day of your life you have to find some time to step behind the closed door with christ amen for god to give you victory over death because you're living in a fallen vessel this vessel is dead one day finally we'll lay it down for good amen and then we'll live in victory for eternity amen but now we fight we win some we lose some but we fight and we claim our victory why because it's a promise god has given you a promise of victory amen behind the closed door behind a closed door in prayer and then pray in secret as we read and also you have to shut the world out you can't let the world in see what happens is when the world comes in to your room you can't shut the door you can't it blocks it open you've got to get the world out so you can shut the door and the only way you can find christ in your room is at the door shut right and then you don't you don't you don't um if you got if your husband and wife you don't do like absalom right you go find you go into the room and you have you have fellowship with your wife and that's what christ is doing in the room behind the closed door having fellowship with you bringing victory in your life bringing the ultimate victory over the devil amen which is the eternal life that you have been given amen and bringing victory to you every single day amen of your life and that is what you need in order to make it to the end of time amen matthew 28. matthew 28 in the end of the sabbath as it began to dawn toward the first day of the week mary gay mary magdalene and the other mary to see the sepulcher and behold there was a great earthquake for the angel of the lord descended from heaven and came and rolled back the stone from the door and sat upon it his countenance was like lightning in his raiment white as snow and for fear of him the keepers did shake and became as dead men and the angel answered and said unto the woman to the women excuse me fear not ye for i know that ye seek jesus which was crucified he is not here for he is risen as he said come see the place where the lord lay amen john 10 verse 9 i am the door by me if any man enter in he shall be saved and shall go in and out and find pasture amen christ is the mystery of god god revealed but the banner says but god's great mystery what the eternal god had as a mystery has now been unfolded in jesus christ then given right down to his church what was once in god's mind is now in the body of christ amen do you believe you're the body of christ tonight jesus making love to the church whoa wait we're not there yet right no no no no no that that's that's coming that's what some people want to say that's coming we're not there yet why because they don't want to do that because to do that is to sell out completely that's right you can't you can't yes sir see what okay so if you read we read in matthew 25 about the foolish and the wise virgin they both slumbered and slept see the foolish virgin wanted to to enjoy the blessings of god in rest but they didn't do so according to the word of god so they slumped slumbered and slept in laziness but the bride the wise virgin slumbered and slept in peace and rest because they had the holy ghost giving them their eternal sabbath right their sabbath their rest praise the lord because once you've sold out to him completely and then he takes everything you gave over to him and he fills the inside of you with his oil and then you got plenty of oil of the holy spirit to shine your light amen and so praise the lord he goes on to say he says jesus making love to the church his bride whispering secrets to her you know how you tell your wife things you know the little girl you're going to marry you love her so much you just tell her the secrets and get her up next to you and love you and everything you know how it is that's what god christ is doing to the church see he is letting her know the secrets christ can't do that unless he's married you if if he was doing that without marrying you he would be contradicting his own word so where does that leave us in matthew 25. somewhere in there right there are they looking for oil that's right right but we have gone with christ amen and we read in there they shut the weed we went in with the bridegroom and shut the door that's why they're trying so hard to find it in tapes only in this preacher or that preacher but they'll never find it and then they'll look but they'll never find it and when they find something it'll be too late amen praise the lord by having the revelation of his secret made known to them by his grace how the grace of god he says so it was the grace of god amen that you even had the oil to begin with and then it's the grace of god that says hey ah come away my love right come on over here sweetheart calm inside the room and then i'm going to shut the door behind the closed door god christ reveals himself to you amen and that's good and and and and and that's the word of god and when i read stuff like that you know growing up in the message when i didn't unders before god gave revelation i didn't understand what that all was it kind of went over my head and so as a minister and i read that kind of stuff and it stirs me all up but i want to know where does it apply now where does it apply now it applies now you got to get in there if you want victory over sin if you want victory over sickness if you want victory at your job if you want victory in your marriage if you want victory with your children you've got to get in behind the closed door with christ you want to raise up amen that we with the youth group we're going through the church age book right now and we just went through the ephesians church ages so we talked a little bit on friday night about going back to our first love amen that's what you have to do you find yourself like the ephesians lacks guess what just because it happens it doesn't mean you're lost because it happens to everybody it's the world we live in but around says we go through cycles of revival and death amen and we're able and what what got what god's going to do when he starts to get closer to that departure time amen is he's going to start pulling on you pressing on you and then so that you're there you're less time between you're between your lows and your and your highs right and did more of a steady amen upward climb like enoch he was walking the earth walking in the in as a believer amen walking after christ and then one of the one day then he just started walking straight up because what he knew and his revelation of christ couldn't he couldn't keep here anymore and that's why the rapture is inside of you because if you if before the foundation of the world god picked you and then potentially gave you the eternal life which is predestination yes sir and then now you're gonna come down here where he picked where you would live and then you're gonna find the rapture out here somewhere that that contradicts with the word of god everything comes from the word because god according to the laws of the universe that he created it's the spoken word so he had to speak it for it to come to pass amen so he spoke it already and one of these days does it going to catch a revelation in your heart in your life we're all going to catch it at the same time and we're going to rapture out of here that's how it's going to work it lines up right with his word praise praise the lord so you'll find victory when you shut the door on the world amen now it's got to be the right door that's right it's got to be the door for ordained which is christ christ is the door so you you got to shut the door and you got to get behind the closed door but that door has to be christ because there's closed doors amen in the world and there's nothing happening behind there that's good and then the closed doors and denominational churches but there's just death behind those doors now amen praise the lord that door has to have the token applied to the doorposts hey man you go go search it there's the the door the subject of the door through the scripture is just it could go 100 100 sermons 100 ways but the token applied to the door so god raised you up and then god transformed your life amen and he gave you the blood a meant to sanctify to justify the door of your heart amen now once that door is justified and sanctified and the the token is applied amen the holy spirit and then testifying of that within your life now you've got a place where you can go and get away with christ and draw closer to him behind that token amen there what there is what brother brown says there's protection from god as long as you're behind his will it could be the same thing as the door because he is the door and as soon as you step out of the door as soon as the children of israel stepped out of the door in egypt where the death angel was passing they would die but unless they were behind the door and then with the blood applied to the doorpost then there was safety so there's victory amen there's there's revelation and there's safety amen behind the closed door with christ amen praise the lord now the doorpost can hold the blood of christ or can be used to bind you to the devil because the scripture in exodus says and if the servant exodus 21 verse 5 to 6 and if the servant shall plainly say i love my master my wife and my children i will not go out free then his master shall bring him unto the judges he shall also bring him to the door or unto the doorpost and his master shall bore his ear through with an all and he shall serve him forever amen so you you have a choice you can serve god you can put your life into god or you can say never mind i don't want to go free and then you're marked amen on the door of your heart to your your your mark through the ear and then now forever amen you are a servant to the devil but before the foundation of the world god said you are my child and so you're not going to be asking for the all in the ear amen you're ready to to go on and serve god and if you read here it says that if the servant becomes the man becomes a servant to his master and he doesn't have a wife and children and he ha he gets married and he has children while he's a servant he has to leave them behind to go free and the scripture we mention this friday night too the scripture says jesus came not to not to to um he came to to to bring division between a son and his father and a daughter and her mother amen god's word calls for total separation amen sometimes that separation comes where it hurts but see god wants to see abraham do you love me enough to sacrifice isaac man you're all abraham's children amen so we have you know say oh well i got my smile from my dad or i got my eyes from my mom or i got my hair from my from my mom or this side of her we got we got that faith from our father abraham coming on down through and now we stand and we testify amen that christ means more to us than any blessings he gives us anything that he gives us we're ready to lay that down and say we're giving it all to you lord amen there's safety behind the closed door i mean just like noah's ark amen who shut the door god shut the door and no one couldn't open it once you are sealed in you can't open it you say oh i made him i made a mistake i you know i did this man you know it's too late for me no no no god shut the door you can't even open it much less anybody else sign sealed and delivered amen there is safety behind the closed door and god is going to see you through whether it be floods amen covid you say well we had covert yeah but you're okay and if you weren't and you passed on yeah you're doing a lot better than the rest of us are so they were safety behind the closed door amen you say well i don't understand everything i read them the seals and i read these these messages and we're reading the church book and i i'm just not really getting it you got to get men behind the closed door and god will reveal it to you now i uh most of you know i'm a software engineer and if if if i start stressing about the time and how long it's taking or something i have to do or i start stressing about something i i can't even think and i have to be able to think if i'm gonna get anything done if when you start stressing about it and you're getting worked up about it you're working right into the hands of the devil he wants to stress you out about it you say oh i i can't figure it out i don't understand what the preacher says and you're walking around and you're talking and you're thinking and you're trying to figure it out right no that's not going to get you anywhere you're at that point in time you're trying to solve your problem when it's as simple as this close the door say father can you tell me a little bit more about you and he's going to give you everything you need in due time amen in in the season if you read the story of corey ten boom she was traveling with her father on a train and she asked him a question about life in general and he said he she said he didn't answer they got to their destination they got up and he said corey can you grab me that suitcase she couldn't lift it and he said there are some things for you to know when you're strong enough to carry them the same thing he said the same thing god does he doesn't give us more than we can carry amen god is going to give you the desires of your heart god's going to give you everything you need in due time amen don't try to force the issue wait on god and he will come along and give you the strength so you say so you could say look at it like this i'm you're carrying a big burden in your life right now why i can hardly handle this guess what you wouldn't be carrying the burden unless your father knew you could carry it you wouldn't be going through what you're going through unless god knew you could handle it amen the next time you're tempted to do wrong remember he has enough faith in you for that temptation because he knows you will move beyond it in victory in christ amen the next time you're facing a battle you say you know praise the lord sometimes we'll just we'll just take a little fictional character here you have a a young man who's who's learning to fight and the old knight knows in great wisdom amen he sees you practicing with the sword and the shield and fighting for practice and then he says okay we're gonna you're gonna go over here and you're gonna fight this other guy you're you're nuts master and chief you're nuts i can't handle that no no it's okay you go do it the faith that god has in you amen should give you a boost of confidence that you can handle amen the battle that is before you amen praise the lord i think i think i've said that as many ways as i possibly can and then that god is not going to give you anything more than you can handle but if you find yourself guess what if you don't feed you're going to get weak and if you don't if you find yourself struggling to carry the burden or struggling to fight the battle go behind closed door and god will give you the strength for the victory in your life amen praise the lord amen praise the lord amen that's well you'll find then i read the scripture and i totally skipped over it i read the quote and then i moved on so we read the scripture in matthew 28 where they go to the sepulcher where they're expecting to find their promised son buried but god comes and moves open that door man god wanted to reveal himself to you it's the same thing in our day because this is the rising of the sun he wanted to express himself to us so you we couldn't go they tried for six ages they tried to tap into it they got a little bit but they couldn't open up the door they couldn't open the tomb and bring out christ and then god had to do it an angel had to come and roll that stone away and when and when that happened amen that through that from that opened door then god could reveal himself to you and that was in history and like i said it's the same thing for you god's going to come and he's going to roll that stone away and reveal himself to you amen in his good time praise the lord now i know that was a bit short tonight but i believe you you can forgive me for that sister and means you guys want to come up tonight i had a um seasoned minister that i one time he said just get out speak the point don't try to fill in the words just say it and then move on so tonight we came out we said it we made the point that's what god led to my heart it only took 42 minutes but i don't know you have preachers that worry about preaching too long and i stress about preaching not long enough but god is faithful man god is faithful and sometimes you have services like tonight and just feel like you're sitting around a fire with pop of god and just hearing a little bit about him amen i love to spend time with him amen and if you're missing you know sometimes you get busy i know i know this will probably mostly be for married couples or but even just families you get busy you don't see each other right you're busy you're doing this you get busy in life and you're not seeing much of god you know you start to feel a little bit of a disconnect go find go on date go on a date go spend some time with christ and and you'll find that everything else runs a lot smoother just just does your house your house runs smoother when you put a little time into your wife praise the lord it's it's good to be a christian what i don't know what she actually can we think come away my love [Music] hey man [Music] is it in

a couple of weeks still but as a church let's be praying for the youth group that's going to peterson's camp um the 1st of june so just a few weeks away getting closer but i pray that we all would join together in prayer that god will do something special and keep us safe a bunch of crazy kids across the west remember but that god would do something special i want to find a balance but i say this i first felt the calling to preach at a camp i was 15 years old and under the presence god began to speak to my heart for that and then it was i was 18 years old and brother lindsey mcgrady was preaching and i was at another camp and in the middle of a sermon he pointed right at me and said don't be afraid to do what god has called you to do pinned me to my seat and i went home and i started preaching but god god does great things because of the atmosphere he can do things anywhere you go if the atmosphere is created amen but what happens is you have a bunch of people coming together who are there to create that atmosphere so great things happen amen why don't we bow our heads tonight heavenly father we thank you for your word lord and thank you that we have a promise father that one
