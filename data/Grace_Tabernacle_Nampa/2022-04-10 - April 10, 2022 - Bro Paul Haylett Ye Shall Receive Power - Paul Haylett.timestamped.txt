[44:21] [Music]
[44:24] hallelujah and while we're testifying
[44:26] that he's in the house
[44:29] you might say this is a little different
[44:30] than we normally do it brother paul but
[44:34] our sister dorcas
[44:37] not feeling well has been to the doctor
[44:39] and the doctor says i believe your heart
[44:41] is enlarged
[44:44] now
[44:46] natural physicians
[44:48] tell you what they know
[44:51] but we serve the great physician
[44:55] and the brothers are going to join me
[44:56] and we are going to just
[44:58] save sister dorcas the strength of
[45:00] walking up here and we're going to
[45:02] anoint her with oil
[45:04] and we're going to pray for her
[45:07] that the doctor finds nothing
[45:10] we rebuke satan in the name of jesus
[45:13] christ it is not
[45:15] my power it's not your power but it is
[45:18] in the power of the spoken word
[45:21] amen join me brothers amen

[46:53] upon this and let our faith be bound
[46:55] with our sister lord that she would be
[46:58] able to step forward and has already
[47:00] confessed lord that she is making that
[47:03] claim so we stand together with our
[47:05] voices raised up my sister has already
[47:09] received her healing in the name of

[47:44] clap of praise

[47:48] thank you lord for this healing
[47:51] thank you lord for touching my sister
[47:54] all saints we've seen it we've seen it
[47:57] too many times the devil might try to
[47:59] deny it he might try to get you to
[48:01] hesitate from it but we have seen the
[48:04] power of the spoken word moving in the
[48:07] bride of christ amen not a week not a
[48:10] month not a year goes by but what god's
[48:13] word is being proven over and over and
[48:17] over again
[48:18] hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah amen
[48:22] thank you sister emmy amen brother jason
[48:25] beautiful song service i love it when
[48:27] the lord just gives that kind of
[48:29] leadership this kind of that kind of
[48:31] anointing our sister beth i love that
[48:34] song amen it just stirs my heart because
[48:37] you see
[48:39] it would take more than carnal
[48:41] understanding
[48:43] to look at your own child flesh and
[48:46] blood laying there dead
[48:49] and the words of your mouth would say
[48:51] all is well
[48:54] that is not a human element
[48:57] that
[48:58] is god manifesting himself in flesh
[49:02] through flesh
[49:03] to be vindicated
[49:06] in the flesh
[49:08] thank you
[49:09] thank you lord
[49:10] hallelujah hallelujah
[49:13] amen just want to
[49:15] stand if you stand for a moment please

[49:22] i say we sister jerry and i
[49:25] will be eating lunch
[49:27] here in the church
[49:29] sunday afternoon after the easter
[49:30] service
[49:32] and i put it that way because i want no
[49:33] one to feel obligated right some have
[49:35] plans that they do with their family and
[49:38] pre-existing you might say plans and
[49:40] so uh
[49:42] we're just going to be here going to eat
[49:44] lunch here at the church
[49:46] and um
[49:47] uh
[49:49] oh let me make this simple just bring
[49:50] your own food
[49:53] okay
[49:54] it might be a quick run to winco for
[49:56] fried chicken but whatever it is but
[50:00] what i'm saying is let's not make a big
[50:02] complicated meal and people feel
[50:04] obligated to do something so i would
[50:07] love to fellowship with you if that fits
[50:09] into your plans amen
[50:12] so
[50:13] i just want to look down through here
[50:15] just a second real quick amen brother
[50:18] jason's already
[50:19] reminded us of communion i bring
[50:22] greetings to you from our brother daniel
[50:24] fryho and just had a
[50:28] lovely lovely conversation with him
[50:30] yesterday and uh him and sister karen
[50:34] send their greetings
[50:35] and you know brother brother daniel i
[50:38] enjoy a very special relationship with
[50:40] him just as though we were uh
[50:43] almost closer i guess you'd say than
[50:45] blood brothers but i i just asked him
[50:48] how everything was going
[50:49] and uh you know some beautiful testimony
[50:52] there because he was talking about how
[50:54] he had just been invited to be a pastor
[50:57] of this little hispanic group
[50:59] and only been a pastor for 30 days when
[51:01] he was stricken down with that that
[51:03] virus infection that went in and started
[51:06] eating on his nerves and the muscles and
[51:08] the bone and and ended up in the
[51:10] hospital incapacitated for months and i
[51:13] said well brother daniel how did the
[51:14] church hold up in this time he said
[51:16] brother paul
[51:17] he said not only did it hold up it
[51:20] thrived
[51:21] they come to the church on sundays and
[51:23] had prayer meetings they come wednesday
[51:25] nights prayer meetings they come during
[51:27] the week they would just meet their
[51:29] their families would come they'd come
[51:30] home from work and go and they would
[51:33] have prayer meeting and god is blessing
[51:36] them and uh just doing a great work now
[51:39] many times people say oh a great work
[51:41] how big is the work
[51:43] my brother and sister the work that
[51:44] began in you and i
[51:46] was a very small work
[51:48] but it was a powerful work it was a work
[51:50] that could not be defeated
[51:53] it was a work that would not give up
[51:56] the number doesn't matter
[51:58] it's the work of god is what really
[52:00] really matters and you know our brother
[52:02] daniel has always had a
[52:04] very maybe this is why we get along very
[52:07] warped sense of humor
[52:08] um but uh i i love his sense of humor
[52:11] and i said how are you doing brother
[52:13] daniel are you getting
[52:15] out and about and he said brother paul
[52:17] he said i have a complete new hip
[52:20] and
[52:21] so with that complete new hip
[52:23] i am able to now preach standing up and
[52:26] he said trust me
[52:27] yeah preaching is wonderful preaching in
[52:30] a wheelchair is difficult
[52:33] and he said i now have my liberty back
[52:35] preaching and uh so really thankful to
[52:38] hear that
[52:41] as he put it i get a preach standing up
[52:43] and i'm walking again and here's where
[52:45] the humor come in he says sometimes i
[52:48] walk with the cane
[52:51] but really only because i think i look
[52:54] good walking with a cane
[52:58] so you know you you've got to just love
[53:01] that sense of humor he doesn't say yeah
[53:03] you know sometimes i have to pack this
[53:04] crazy stick around it's like no i look
[53:06] good
[53:08] anyway let's remember our brother daniel
[53:10] sister karen in prayer and um i put out
[53:15] i don't know when it will
[53:18] you know be for him the time
[53:20] he said they drove down to tucson to um
[53:23] visit some family and he said that two
[53:25] and a half hours in the car was just
[53:28] about the limit of what he could handle
[53:31] i've invited him to come and preach for
[53:33] us again so whenever the lord opens that
[53:35] door
[53:37] we would enjoy seeing
[53:39] of them again amen
[53:42] okay so
[53:43] remember winco has fried chicken you
[53:45] don't even have to spend your next
[53:47] easter morning cooking it amen
[53:49] let's turn in our bibles i want to
[53:52] speak to you on um you shall receive
[53:55] power
[53:56] now my brother and sister this actually
[53:58] is
[53:59] a a
[54:01] promise to us
[54:03] that has a caveat to it
[54:06] we're not just going to come start going
[54:08] to church and walk in the door and just
[54:10] be what we're going to be and receive
[54:12] power
[54:14] so
[54:15] the word of god puts a as it were
[54:18] parameter
[54:20] of how it will be that we'll receive
[54:22] power amen one we know we have to repent
[54:27] and we have to get baptized
[54:29] in the name of jesus christ not just any
[54:32] old form not any old words not just hey
[54:34] jesus said but in his name we receive
[54:38] that
[54:39] and then the word says then you receive
[54:42] the gift of the holy ghost
[54:44] but when we look at this now my brother
[54:46] and sister is we'll go back the same
[54:48] scripture out of luke that we were in
[54:50] last
[54:51] last week or or
[54:53] was it luke or axe
[54:55] acts i guess luke said it
[54:58] but we look at this see and and god puts
[55:01] it in the right context for us to be
[55:03] able to follow that pattern and i find
[55:06] it interesting just doing some studying
[55:09] in the life of the prophet
[55:11] and uh that caused me to go back and
[55:15] look as it were in the life of our lord
[55:17] jesus christ and you know many writings
[55:21] but writing without anointing
[55:24] is just words
[55:26] and words without anointing are just
[55:28] words
[55:30] so the spoken word by individual without
[55:33] anointing is just words and writing
[55:35] without the anointing especially when
[55:38] you start talking about what jesus did
[55:41] and what jesus said and those that were
[55:43] around him you can write a very dry
[55:46] historical memoir
[55:49] that is powerless
[55:51] that's right
[55:52] now having said that i don't want to
[55:54] offend anyone
[55:55] but we can look back even in our day and
[55:57] the prophet that god sent to our age
[56:01] we can render that
[56:04] dry
[56:05] and powerless
[56:07] that's not what god intended
[56:10] god intended for this word to be so
[56:12] powerful
[56:14] delivering power healing power
[56:17] everything we need kind of power
[56:21] but if we take it dry
[56:24] historical
[56:27] it will be powerless
[56:29] amen
[56:30] so let's just turn luke uh the first i
[56:33] mean luke i keep on to say luke
[56:35] amen acts the first chapter verse four
[56:38] amen
[56:39] had a lot of studying in luke and luke
[56:42] is on the mind i guess amen
[56:45] acts the first chapter we'll start with
[56:47] the fourth verse through the eighth
[56:54] now we see
[56:56] in the word here
[56:58] these people were assembled together
[57:03] and we'll find that
[57:05] as a as a trend you might say that is
[57:08] promoted all the way through scripture
[57:11] not to forsake the assembling of
[57:13] ourselves together to be assembled
[57:15] together uh how important that is to us
[57:19] amen
[57:20] now
[57:21] excuse me here i had one last note that
[57:24] i just noticed
[57:26] now
[57:28] i don't want to embarrass anybody shame
[57:30] anybody but um
[57:33] our church is going to grow here in a
[57:34] couple months by one more precious baby
[57:38] and
[57:39] oh nothing to be embarrassed about
[57:41] sister tomah i'm excited
[57:43] we get to hold one more little baby by
[57:46] god's grace whoever has the privilege to
[57:48] dedicate that child we get to create the
[57:50] atmosphere as a assembly that's what
[57:54] stirred my mind back to that note amen
[57:57] this is not their family gets a child
[58:00] the assembly
[58:02] gets a child
[58:03] amen and i say thank you lord i feel
[58:06] very blessed that one more child comes
[58:09] in and we get to we get to just be a
[58:13] part of that and lift them up in prayer
[58:15] and
[58:16] amen
[58:18] hug and
[58:19] maybe even kiss on the cute little thing
[58:22] amen
[58:24] and being assembled together with them
[58:26] commanded them that they should not
[58:27] depart from jerusalem
[58:30] now my brother and sister while we do
[58:31] not hold to a mecca
[58:34] as it is we have to be one place to
[58:36] receive the word of god god laid a
[58:39] foundation for them he had the time and
[58:43] the place already picked out and god has
[58:47] the time and the place for you and i we
[58:49] can't just randomly say i'm going to
[58:51] worship god on the mountain on sundays
[58:53] i'm going to do this i'm going to do
[58:55] that god has a plan for us and as he
[58:59] shares this with them that they should
[59:00] not depart from jerusalem but wait for
[59:03] the promise of the father which saith he
[59:06] ye have heard of me so this promise is
[59:10] not a mystery
[59:11] to those god's fixing to anoint with the
[59:14] holy ghost
[59:16] people say i was just walking along and
[59:18] the holy ghost fell on me
[59:21] well that's wonderful
[59:23] but you see my brother and sister it has
[59:25] to be god's choice of when where how
[59:29] we can't just have an emotional shiver
[59:32] and call it the holy ghost
[59:34] amen now i i was well and let me you're
[59:38] all standing and i'll just preach the
[59:40] whole sermon to you
[59:42] for john truly baptized with water but
[59:44] ye shall be baptized with the holy ghost
[59:46] not many days hints right he's put a
[59:48] time frame for them
[59:50] when they therefore will come together
[59:52] they ask of him saying lord will thou at
[59:54] this time restore again the kingdom to
[59:57] israel.
[59:58] and he saith said unto them it is not
[1:00:02] for you to know the times or the seasons
[1:00:04] which the father hath put in his own
[1:00:06] power
[1:00:07] but ye shall receive power after that
[1:00:11] the holy ghost is come upon you and ye
[1:00:14] shall be witnesses unto me both in
[1:00:16] jerusalem in all judea and samaria and
[1:00:19] to the uttermost part of the earth
[1:00:22] heavenly father we ask lord for
[1:00:23] blessings upon your word upon this
[1:00:25] thought today lord may it be food father
[1:00:28] for the bride of christ in your name we
[1:00:30] pray amen
[1:00:32] you may be seated
[1:00:34] amen
[1:00:36] so as we look at this my brother and
[1:00:37] sister we we find that that in spite of
[1:00:41] the human characteristic or desire or as
[1:00:45] i speak of myself often the curiosities
[1:00:47] to know and answer uh god said you know
[1:00:50] it's not really for you to know now many
[1:00:53] people have put it in different fashions
[1:00:55] they tried to even pressure the profit
[1:00:58] into putting a time frame to it and and
[1:01:01] that but you see it's up to god amen and
[1:01:04] he's put it in his own power and we're
[1:01:06] going to talk this morning
[1:01:08] on this topic you know ye shall receive
[1:01:10] power so this power that god has that
[1:01:13] the time and the season is contained in
[1:01:16] it is there my brother and sister that
[1:01:18] at god's choosing he's going to unleash
[1:01:20] that power to us and in that you could
[1:01:23] say he is giving us revelation you know
[1:01:26] that's what the uh the rapture will be
[1:01:28] it will be a revelation to the bride of
[1:01:30] jesus christ it it is not as it were a
[1:01:33] calculation but it is a revelation and
[1:01:36] so too many people by trying to put
[1:01:38] times and dates and circumstances and
[1:01:41] all of these factors uh try to put it
[1:01:43] into a calculation now my brother and
[1:01:46] sister it is fine it is not
[1:01:49] a sin for us to look at the signs and
[1:01:51] the seasons and what is happening in the
[1:01:53] world around us and say you know lord
[1:01:56] it's got to be getting close i think
[1:01:57] most of us would say amen to that it
[1:02:00] it's got to be getting close we're
[1:02:02] seeing all of these things that have
[1:02:04] been spoken and prophesied coming
[1:02:07] together and my brother and sister as
[1:02:09] they come together they become magnified
[1:02:11] and so it's there that we are looking at
[1:02:14] a time and a season but you know i
[1:02:16] always like to temper that kind of
[1:02:18] conversation with the fact that the
[1:02:20] prophet of god said that you should keep
[1:02:22] planting your potatoes
[1:02:24] now if you want to get real technical on
[1:02:26] the verbiage as some people would be oh
[1:02:28] we're not farmers we don't have potatoes
[1:02:30] to plant well maybe it is a season
[1:02:32] because my whole backyard is going to be
[1:02:34] 80 acres of potatoes this year
[1:02:38] but i only say that in humor
[1:02:41] because the real thing that god wants us
[1:02:43] to do
[1:02:44] is just be ready
[1:02:47] don't become lukewarm
[1:02:50] don't become cold
[1:02:52] be ready
[1:02:53] but he also didn't want us to do which
[1:02:55] is what happened to many people in 1977
[1:02:59] and that is they sold houses lands cars
[1:03:01] businesses whatever it was
[1:03:03] only to find that they had not had the
[1:03:06] revelation that they thought they had so
[1:03:09] the prophet of god wants you to get up
[1:03:11] every morning saying i'm going to live
[1:03:13] for the lord today and when the sun sets
[1:03:16] at night say lord keep us while we sleep
[1:03:19] and we'll rise again tomorrow to serve
[1:03:21] you again and you know some of us may
[1:03:24] well grow old and you will hold a
[1:03:26] memorial for us and the lord might not
[1:03:28] have still come but my brother and
[1:03:30] sister that's not what we're doing if we
[1:03:32] take that kind of approach we're
[1:03:34] actually looking for an accent plan
[1:03:36] we're looking for a shortcut we're
[1:03:38] looking to i can hold on long enough to
[1:03:41] get to that point you can hold on as
[1:03:44] long as you desire in your heart because
[1:03:47] you are going to receive power
[1:03:50] you say brother paul i don't know
[1:03:52] sometimes uh you know you have a bad day
[1:03:54] i know none of you have bad days
[1:03:57] none of you it's just people like you
[1:04:00] yeah
[1:04:01] yeah
[1:04:02] but you see that's not that's not what
[1:04:05] god's looking at my brother and sister
[1:04:07] and and if i can get myself started here
[1:04:09] we'll kind of go down through this amen
[1:04:11] so as we look at this
[1:04:13] we see this great need
[1:04:15] now we'll bring this up in our closing
[1:04:18] quote today but speaking of satan's
[1:04:21] reasoning and i just want to interject
[1:04:23] that so that the thought of reasoning
[1:04:25] would be here uh in your mind or
[1:04:27] thoughts as we're preaching
[1:04:30] i think it's very safe to say i mean
[1:04:32] absolutely safe to say there is no true
[1:04:34] life outside of jesus christ
[1:04:37] now there is living flesh that is there
[1:04:39] but not it's not really life my brother
[1:04:42] and sister and uh so it is there that we
[1:04:45] realize that uh as as i've been studying
[1:04:48] and almost preached on this morning
[1:04:50] a topic connected to investments you
[1:04:54] know uh the word tells us that uh he has
[1:04:57] gone to prepare a place for us and many
[1:04:59] mansions and and the context of this in
[1:05:02] my house
[1:05:04] all of this is there my brother and
[1:05:05] sister but to achieve that you have to
[1:05:08] make an investment and we're living in a
[1:05:10] world today that certainly it is kind of
[1:05:13] daunting you know the the powers to be
[1:05:16] or out here saying we're headed for
[1:05:18] another bubble we're headed for another
[1:05:20] crisis we're headed for these things and
[1:05:22] many people are finding themselves
[1:05:25] paralyzed to to move forward but my
[1:05:28] brother and sister no matter what you do
[1:05:30] in life you are making an investment and
[1:05:33] those investments are either declining
[1:05:35] or they are rising and we say well we
[1:05:37] need to you know need to drive a
[1:05:39] dependable vehicle that's wonderful but
[1:05:41] remember dependability doesn't always
[1:05:43] mean expensive and so you know we look
[1:05:46] at that and we say well i if i invest in
[1:05:49] a new car the price of it's going to
[1:05:51] fall uh and that is a losing or
[1:05:54] declining asset and if i buy property it
[1:05:58] would be an investment that would uh
[1:06:01] gain or rise in value but my brother and
[1:06:04] sister all of that is still irrelevant
[1:06:06] in the life of a son or daughter of god
[1:06:09] because to us there is only one
[1:06:11] investment that we can make that
[1:06:13] actually pays off
[1:06:15] all the res rest of this just burns at
[1:06:17] some point in time all the rest of this
[1:06:20] is the prophet of god said the day will
[1:06:21] come will take they'll take your church
[1:06:24] from you and turn it to a storehouse
[1:06:26] so all the investment that we have made
[1:06:29] in this building right here would come
[1:06:31] to naught in the relevant sense but my
[1:06:33] brother and sister there's an investment
[1:06:35] that we have been given and we can make
[1:06:37] it every day amen we can invest into
[1:06:40] that every single day and that
[1:06:42] investment cannot be taken away from us
[1:06:45] it is not an investment as it were of
[1:06:48] flesh and blood or physical but it is
[1:06:50] the power of almighty god it is god
[1:06:54] preparing in you amen that's the thing
[1:06:57] sometimes we're getting the idea i'm
[1:06:58] going to go to heaven well the prophet
[1:07:00] of god preached right here that you get
[1:07:02] a taste of heaven in advance
[1:07:04] amen you're gonna live in spiritual
[1:07:07] places you're gonna live in that realm
[1:07:09] of the elevated now the devil sometimes
[1:07:12] can can uh just uh bring you into a
[1:07:15] place you get nervous about things and i
[1:07:17] i hate to be this transparent but you
[1:07:19] know i've just been really nervous
[1:07:21] lately because everything that we have
[1:07:22] tried to plan to plant etc etc it just
[1:07:25] seems like there's roadblocks and
[1:07:27] insufficient water and when you've got a
[1:07:29] landlord that you've been paying you
[1:07:31] know x amount of sum of money every year
[1:07:34] to him and it it's something that you
[1:07:37] struggle with to word it and to find and
[1:07:39] finally just have to get brave and and
[1:07:41] contact them and say i simply can't do
[1:07:44] this
[1:07:44] there's no way we can physically do this
[1:07:47] and you know i i bring this as an
[1:07:49] example to you because this man is just
[1:07:52] simply an investor his family is quite
[1:07:55] wealthy they live in california they own
[1:07:57] real estate all over the world and kind
[1:08:00] of uh the original relationship was well
[1:08:02] you meet our terms or we'll find someone
[1:08:05] who can
[1:08:06] and i'm fretting freddie freddie and i
[1:08:08] finally contact him and i say this is
[1:08:10] what's happening and i can't do it and
[1:08:12] this is the best i can do
[1:08:15] fine just do what's best i trust you
[1:08:18] now look what all my worry
[1:08:20] got me
[1:08:23] but the devil had that anointed
[1:08:25] to where i couldn't hardly sleep over
[1:08:27] this equation
[1:08:29] and many of you will have something very
[1:08:31] similar in your life amen and that is
[1:08:33] why we are called to have confidence
[1:08:35] right our healing is not in our hand
[1:08:37] saints it our healing is not in the
[1:08:40] doctor's hands our healing is in the
[1:08:43] hands of our lord jesus christ and he
[1:08:46] has not failed us now people say but but
[1:08:48] our sister laura passed away no my
[1:08:51] brother and sister our sister laura got
[1:08:53] promoted
[1:08:56] but in our human element we look at it
[1:08:59] contrary you might say
[1:09:01] to the way that god is doing and we are
[1:09:04] then under that influence of satan's
[1:09:06] reasoning
[1:09:10] so no life outside of jesus christ but
[1:09:13] you see satan will try to reason you
[1:09:15] now catch this
[1:09:17] satan will try to reason you
[1:09:20] into a position
[1:09:22] that fits your carnal feelings that's
[1:09:24] exactly right amen
[1:09:27] amen
[1:09:28] well
[1:09:29] this is how it is
[1:09:33] that's why you've still got to be real
[1:09:34] careful when you say oh no i'm not
[1:09:36] speaking doubt i'm not speaking fear i'm
[1:09:38] just speaking facts
[1:09:39] who's facts
[1:09:42] who's facts if they're god's facts it
[1:09:44] might be an entirely different
[1:09:45] conversation
[1:09:46] but if they're human facts
[1:09:49] we could say oh it's all going to come
[1:09:51] to an end this is horrible
[1:09:53] but we've got to get in the realm we're
[1:09:55] actually caught up in the mind of christ
[1:09:58] preaching the speaking god's facts
[1:10:01] amen his fact says i'll never leave you
[1:10:03] i'll never forsake you i was with you in
[1:10:06] the beginning i will be with you in the
[1:10:08] end
[1:10:10] that's god's facts
[1:10:12] but we get caught up in the carnal
[1:10:14] reasoning a carnal position that this is
[1:10:17] all going downhill well you know what if
[1:10:19] we're going to talk like that maybe we
[1:10:21] ought to just be a hundred percent the
[1:10:23] other way amen and just walk around and
[1:10:25] say woe is me now i'm preaching to paul
[1:10:27] this morning amen woe is me how about we
[1:10:30] just change that and walk around and say
[1:10:32] praise the lord god's blessing me god's
[1:10:34] blessing me god's blessing me i'm gonna
[1:10:36] have more amen a greater spiritual walk
[1:10:39] i'm gonna have more strength i'm gonna
[1:10:41] have more understanding more natural
[1:10:43] knowledge i'm going to have more of
[1:10:45] everything than i've ever had and people
[1:10:47] will say something's wrong with you
[1:10:49] because otherwise we've got to walk
[1:10:51] around and say you know
[1:10:52] our country
[1:10:54] that starts with an eye and enzo with a
[1:10:56] tea guy in the white house
[1:10:59] he's just running he's sucking all the
[1:11:01] life out of our nation and it's going
[1:11:03] downhill everywhere you look going down
[1:11:05] he oh
[1:11:06] look at this
[1:11:08] yeah look at this
[1:11:12] brother jason should we move to canada
[1:11:15] he says no
[1:11:18] where are we going to go my brother and
[1:11:20] sister
[1:11:21] the word of god shows we have no refuge
[1:11:25] but jesus christ
[1:11:27] no refuge but the word
[1:11:30] but you see satan's trying to reason us
[1:11:33] into a position where we'll say well you
[1:11:35] know we're going to just have to go
[1:11:36] ahead and buy that land in montana
[1:11:40] and you guys can build there's enough
[1:11:41] pine trees there you can build your
[1:11:42] cabin i can't see you and i can't see
[1:11:44] you know blah blah blah and we'll do all
[1:11:46] this you know what will happen
[1:11:48] pretty soon somebody will say your
[1:11:49] cabin's nicer than mine you ought to
[1:11:51] give it to me
[1:11:53] somebody will say the creek behind your
[1:11:54] cabin has fish in it my no give it to me
[1:11:57] and pretty soon the devil pour in a
[1:11:59] little sand and sand creates friction
[1:12:01] and pretty soon it will blow apart and
[1:12:03] then we would say i guess there's no god
[1:12:05] after all
[1:12:07] we serve an awesome god
[1:12:09] we don't have to flee to a wilderness as
[1:12:11] it were to hide we can stand on the word
[1:12:14] of god and know that the power of the
[1:12:17] word is what is going to change our life
[1:12:20] amen now look you see
[1:12:23] satan will try and reason with you into
[1:12:25] a position that fits your carnal feeling
[1:12:30] brother branham says right here now
[1:12:31] you're familiar with this scripture i
[1:12:33] mean this quote
[1:12:34] now paul's speaking here of the valley
[1:12:36] or the shadow rather the law being a
[1:12:39] shadow of good things to come could
[1:12:40] never make the worshiper perfect
[1:12:44] yeah that's right we agree with that
[1:12:48] then he goes on to show
[1:12:50] what the perfection is
[1:12:52] now it's a strange thing that this is so
[1:12:54] much thought of people they say well
[1:12:59] satan anointing my carnal feelings
[1:13:04] i'm weak
[1:13:07] now my brother and sister son or
[1:13:08] daughter of god that's not allowing
[1:13:10] their carnal feelings to be anointed
[1:13:11] it's not going to talk like this that's
[1:13:13] exactly right
[1:13:14] amen are you listening paul
[1:13:19] amen
[1:13:21] my faith is not very much
[1:13:24] i'm not a very good christian
[1:13:28] see that's all anointings
[1:13:30] come on get this this is going to be a
[1:13:32] slap to you and a slap to me
[1:13:34] this never comes my brother and sister
[1:13:37] until the thought has been pregnanted in
[1:13:40] our own mind and spirit
[1:13:44] when you are standing on the word of god
[1:13:46] and you are not going to listen to the
[1:13:48] devil these words will never affect you
[1:13:52] but when we have come into that certain
[1:13:54] position
[1:13:57] in the world of psychology they call
[1:13:59] them triggers
[1:14:01] now now i know
[1:14:03] i know that you know you just
[1:14:05] you just go and do these things after
[1:14:08] this this and this happens
[1:14:10] so what you got to do to not do that is
[1:14:14] just make sure
[1:14:15] this this and this doesn't ever happen
[1:14:17] around you
[1:14:21] well absolutely i can do that
[1:14:24] i can never go to work ever again
[1:14:27] i could never drive
[1:14:30] i could never
[1:14:31] you know whatever
[1:14:33] because the trigger is always there
[1:14:36] are you with me saints the trigger is
[1:14:39] always there you can't hide from the
[1:14:42] trigger
[1:14:46] satan comes in and says well they're in
[1:14:48] that position they're headed there
[1:14:49] headed right down the deal they just
[1:14:50] opened their checkbook they got 500
[1:14:52] worth of bills and got 300 in the
[1:14:54] checkbook they're set up
[1:14:58] or to those of you
[1:15:01] whatever it might be
[1:15:04] but you see
[1:15:06] it's strange thing that this is so
[1:15:08] much thought of of people they say well
[1:15:10] i'm weak my faith is not very much i'm
[1:15:12] not a very good christian that's just
[1:15:14] what the devil wants you to say
[1:15:17] oh my paul he's preaching at you this
[1:15:20] morning
[1:15:21] amen you're just talking
[1:15:24] his language right then see you mustn't
[1:15:28] never say that don't never let your
[1:15:29] testimony be negative let it be positive
[1:15:32] all the time you say how can it be
[1:15:35] positive all the time brother paul i'm
[1:15:37] living life as a human in the flesh how
[1:15:40] can it be positive all the time
[1:15:45] well the prophet of god said if you
[1:15:46] didn't want the devil to defeat you
[1:15:49] all you had to do is one simple thing
[1:15:52] can somebody tell me what that was
[1:15:55] stay
[1:15:56] under the blood
[1:15:59] there is our protection
[1:16:01] against the fiery darts of the enemy
[1:16:04] now people say you know i've never
[1:16:06] really been in a fiery trial
[1:16:09] i guess the devil doesn't count me i've
[1:16:11] heard testimony this might not be
[1:16:13] perfect word for word yeah i've never
[1:16:15] been in a real fiery trial i guess the
[1:16:17] devil just doesn't deem me worthy
[1:16:21] come on
[1:16:22] here we are
[1:16:24] you just placed value on yourself that
[1:16:27] was agreeing with the devil's anointing
[1:16:32] and you never thought you was in a
[1:16:33] battle
[1:16:36] you must never say that don't never let
[1:16:37] your testimony be negative let it be
[1:16:39] positive old time i am safe can we say
[1:16:42] that together i am saved
[1:16:45] i have god in my heart let's say that
[1:16:47] together i have god in my heart
[1:16:50] i believe him with all my heart
[1:16:54] amen you see how simple this comes to
[1:16:57] pushing back the anointing that satan
[1:17:00] puts in the time that we're in a certain
[1:17:03] position and our human thinking is there
[1:17:06] and it coincides and it seems
[1:17:08] so reasonable
[1:17:12] see satan has us reasoning
[1:17:15] now my brother and sister this also
[1:17:16] could be brought in a sense to say that
[1:17:19] when we would agree with the devil and
[1:17:20] this just really struck me deep in my
[1:17:22] heart but when we agree with the devil
[1:17:24] of this we're making the blood of jesus
[1:17:26] christ to none effect
[1:17:31] that's not who we are that's not what we
[1:17:33] were called for not called to make the
[1:17:34] blood of jesus christ of none effect oh
[1:17:37] i never meant that but you see it's what
[1:17:39] satan anoints us to do
[1:17:41] amen now you look at this
[1:17:44] we know the scripture talks about to
[1:17:46] obey is better than sacrifice
[1:17:48] now i'm going to throw a little curve
[1:17:49] ball at you today my brother and sister
[1:17:52] because we would be then i'll just be
[1:17:54] obedient i'll be obedient so that i
[1:17:56] don't have to sacrifice but we're going
[1:17:58] to look at this today and realize that
[1:18:00] sacrifice is a part of our experience
[1:18:02] there is no getting to heaven on flowery
[1:18:06] beds of east
[1:18:08] there is a sacrifice that is required of
[1:18:11] every one of us amen as we would see in
[1:18:14] israel they had to bring the lamb or the
[1:18:16] turtle dove but man perverted that and
[1:18:19] started to make money out of that and
[1:18:22] and they started to make a tradition and
[1:18:24] they thought it would make sense my
[1:18:26] brother and sister to bring the auction
[1:18:28] yard right to the step of the church to
[1:18:31] make religion convenient
[1:18:35] sometimes we need a hard thing in our
[1:18:37] life
[1:18:38] sometimes we get just life is so full of
[1:18:42] of uh uh ease that that we actually uh
[1:18:45] become very spiritually lazy uh we
[1:18:48] become spiritually obese uh we we can't
[1:18:52] make a sacrifice because that's
[1:18:54] inconvenient for us
[1:18:56] amen
[1:18:57] i remember reading
[1:18:59] i might not have this right of those who
[1:19:00] you know this quote but i remember
[1:19:02] reading this some time back and said
[1:19:04] there's two ways a man will wear out his
[1:19:06] britches
[1:19:08] either the bottom
[1:19:10] or the knees
[1:19:13] on his knees praying for god to come
[1:19:16] or on his bottom
[1:19:18] waiting for god to come
[1:19:21] now i thought that was very interesting
[1:19:22] my brother and sister not to say that
[1:19:24] you can't be seated amen and and pray
[1:19:27] for god to come but just making that
[1:19:29] point amen
[1:19:30] to obey is better than sacrifice you see
[1:19:33] this is part of our experience my
[1:19:35] brother and sister and and it requires a
[1:19:37] sacrifice on our part and you look at
[1:19:40] this uh uh and i i think not to change
[1:19:43] scripture but you look at this i would
[1:19:45] say obedience brings sacrifice
[1:19:48] in fact there would be certain things in
[1:19:50] our life that when we're obedient to the
[1:19:52] word we'll start sacrificing certain
[1:19:55] things that were important in our life
[1:19:57] people say well well i want to be able
[1:19:59] to serve god and just live like i did
[1:20:01] before find me an example in scripture
[1:20:05] where the power of the word when it
[1:20:07] struck the seed in the heart left a
[1:20:09] person just like they was before
[1:20:12] now you study the apostles the disciples
[1:20:14] and you will see it upended their whole
[1:20:16] industry their careers their whole lives
[1:20:19] and it cost them their life
[1:20:22] because the obedience to the word caused
[1:20:25] them to break away
[1:20:27] now when you think about this my brother
[1:20:29] and sister i don't know that this is
[1:20:31] totally accurate but you know
[1:20:33] matthew tax collector right
[1:20:41] that stigma
[1:20:43] remained on him
[1:20:45] until he died
[1:20:49] in roman society the tax collector in in
[1:20:53] israel was of of the lowest we would
[1:20:55] think well he got to go no my brother
[1:20:57] and sister this is the guy that come and
[1:20:58] knocked on your door
[1:21:00] now imagine how you'd feel brother paul
[1:21:02] started implementing in the church here
[1:21:05] a mandatory inventory of your finances
[1:21:10] that we knock on your door and say okay
[1:21:12] let us see your pay stub let us see your
[1:21:14] your you think that's ridiculous
[1:21:17] i can tell you of a religion right now
[1:21:19] that does that
[1:21:21] and the people submit
[1:21:24] now you tell me oh no we wouldn't do
[1:21:26] that that's not the word but i'm telling
[1:21:27] you under anointings
[1:21:30] of reasoning
[1:21:32] people open their finances and they tell
[1:21:34] them what they're going to give
[1:21:36] isn't that amazing you see how i'm
[1:21:38] letting you off
[1:21:44] the problem see is
[1:21:46] what they've done is try to make a
[1:21:47] forced obedience
[1:21:50] and i believe any real true minister of
[1:21:52] the gospel is going to remind you what
[1:21:54] malachi 3 says
[1:21:57] you're not going to just say oh we've
[1:21:58] just scrubbed that and put it under the
[1:22:00] rug that's old testament that's god's
[1:22:02] word
[1:22:03] but you see the neat thing i was going
[1:22:05] to use the word cool but that sounds so
[1:22:07] outdated now
[1:22:08] we've got all these new woke phrases
[1:22:11] that cool is just and awesome i guess
[1:22:13] it's out also
[1:22:15] but look at this my brother and sister
[1:22:17] what the holy spirit
[1:22:19] desires today
[1:22:21] is not that you be mandated
[1:22:27] but you be molded by the word
[1:22:29] then the word brings you and you say i
[1:22:31] want to be obedient and no i'm not
[1:22:33] preaching about ties this morning
[1:22:37] but you see
[1:22:38] how god chooses to work
[1:22:42] so we study the history of the early
[1:22:44] church
[1:22:49] and and
[1:22:50] we see how the the disciples left a
[1:22:54] powerful testimony
[1:22:56] there there was there was no doubting
[1:23:00] who these men were
[1:23:02] my brother and sister when you went on
[1:23:03] the shores of galilee you went to hebron
[1:23:05] you went to jerusalem you know they come
[1:23:08] a season that nobody had to say so we
[1:23:10] heard jesus's disciples are in town who
[1:23:13] are they
[1:23:16] history clearly shows scripture and
[1:23:18] history clearly shows that they become a
[1:23:22] very focal point of walking down the
[1:23:25] street people knew who they were and
[1:23:27] some said oh praise the lord those are
[1:23:30] those faithful men
[1:23:32] and others despise them and said how can
[1:23:34] we put them to death how can we defame
[1:23:37] them you see there was something that
[1:23:39] was being brought out and it was there
[1:23:42] in that my brother and sister that the
[1:23:44] sacrifice that they were making in their
[1:23:47] mind now this is after they receive the
[1:23:49] holy ghost my brother and sister the
[1:23:51] sacrifice that would be in one man's
[1:23:53] mind and say why have they sacrificed
[1:23:56] their fishing fleet and their family and
[1:23:58] their positions here for this here and
[1:24:01] others would say oh they are so blessed
[1:24:05] it was all that anointing
[1:24:09] why today to people say the message of
[1:24:11] the hour
[1:24:12] i see things about it i believe are the
[1:24:14] truth but why do they say it's too hard
[1:24:17] to live
[1:24:22] and yet there's a people
[1:24:25] that every day are saying lord
[1:24:28] let me sacrifice myself more
[1:24:31] lord let me die to myself more today
[1:24:34] than yesterday
[1:24:36] lord i feel like sometimes i'm an utter
[1:24:38] failure now i don't want to lift no
[1:24:40] hands but the devil would like to anoint
[1:24:42] us with that spirit of utter failure and
[1:24:45] we fall under that but the prophet of
[1:24:47] god said you know that when he has
[1:24:50] redeemed you you are completely redeemed
[1:24:53] he didn't redeem one portion of you for
[1:24:56] a day but he redeemed you for eternity
[1:25:01] amen isn't that beautiful
[1:25:04] and we could turn around and say but i
[1:25:05] made mistakes yesterday that's right you
[1:25:08] made mistakes but the prophet of god
[1:25:10] says
[1:25:12] god didn't see it that's right
[1:25:15] but he says you won't willfully do it
[1:25:17] right
[1:25:18] in other words you won't say well praise
[1:25:20] the lord i'll go to church tomorrow
[1:25:22] i'll drop my shackle in the offering
[1:25:27] i'm forgiven
[1:25:29] see wrong approach
[1:25:31] the real believer's heart grieves
[1:25:34] amen it's bleeding in that sacrifice
[1:25:37] it's bleeding in that situation it's
[1:25:40] crying out forgive me lord
[1:25:43] amen
[1:25:44] amen
[1:25:47] these disciples they left a powerful
[1:25:49] testimony
[1:25:51] a powerful witness
[1:25:54] what was the witness of
[1:25:56] we walked with jesus
[1:25:59] no that would have worked on judas too
[1:26:04] i was there at the last supper
[1:26:06] should have worked on judas too
[1:26:12] there was something more something
[1:26:13] deeper
[1:26:15] something more intrinsic
[1:26:18] that gripped their hearts
[1:26:20] what it was the experience of the upper
[1:26:23] room my brother and sister the
[1:26:25] culmination of jesus ministry in that
[1:26:28] season see we got to be careful to say
[1:26:30] that's just not the culmination of his
[1:26:31] ministry that was a culmination of his
[1:26:34] ministry in that season
[1:26:37] did you know my brother and sister in
[1:26:39] every city and every place in the world
[1:26:42] there is an upper room
[1:26:47] now you're not going to walk in and find
[1:26:48] a travel guide and look through it and
[1:26:50] say okay where's the upper room in in
[1:26:52] chicago where's the upper room in san
[1:26:54] antonio where's the upper room in miami
[1:26:57] no no you're not going to find that but
[1:26:58] i can assure you in every city in every
[1:27:01] country in this world every countryside
[1:27:04] there's an upper room it might be a
[1:27:06] little shanty in the country it might be
[1:27:09] a nice beautiful church somewhere but it
[1:27:11] doesn't matter god has provided that
[1:27:14] upper room because that upper room
[1:27:16] experience is a culmination
[1:27:18] of the whole revelation of jesus christ
[1:27:21] he placed his authority my brother and
[1:27:24] sister 120
[1:27:26] original believers
[1:27:30] believed him and i put that to that term
[1:27:32] in that way
[1:27:33] because they believed him enough
[1:27:36] to climb the stairs
[1:27:39] they believed him enough to not go back
[1:27:41] home and become a carpenter go back home
[1:27:43] and become a fisherman go back over here
[1:27:46] and become a tax collector they believed
[1:27:48] enough to come and say he said don't
[1:27:50] leave jerusalem until you've been endued
[1:27:53] with power and there was something
[1:27:55] inside of them that longed for that
[1:27:57] power it was not the kind of power to
[1:27:59] step out in the street and say whoa unto
[1:28:02] you and woe unto you and do you do this
[1:28:04] and you do that but it was a power that
[1:28:06] was down inside of their soul and they
[1:28:09] longed for that
[1:28:14] hallelujah
[1:28:19] you know the common sense thing today
[1:28:20] would have been just had brother david
[1:28:22] preach because i don't feel good
[1:28:25] but the other common sense thing today
[1:28:28] is that when god puts something on your
[1:28:29] heart
[1:28:30] you preach it
[1:28:32] hallelujah
[1:28:36] so they have this witness of upper room
[1:28:37] experience now my brother and sister you
[1:28:39] realize how much that marked them
[1:28:43] it marked them severe
[1:28:45] everyone knew those were the guys were
[1:28:48] down there in the upper room drunk
[1:28:51] they were up there drunk
[1:28:53] but they were speaking in some language
[1:28:54] we didn't even know and i'm fluent in
[1:28:56] six different languages and and i i
[1:28:58] didn't recognize any of these languages
[1:29:00] that's because it was a heavenly
[1:29:01] language
[1:29:03] and the only way you learn a heavenly
[1:29:04] language is to be in heavenly places
[1:29:08] amen you can't go down here as it were
[1:29:10] they term things you know like las vegas
[1:29:12] you can't be down here on this strip and
[1:29:14] learn a heavenly language
[1:29:16] amen you've got to be in the presence of
[1:29:18] almighty god amen so this upper room
[1:29:20] experience my brothers is something that
[1:29:22] is duplicated today as if that would be
[1:29:25] a correct word i could use because you
[1:29:27] see god brings this wherever and
[1:29:29] whenever it is not something it's like
[1:29:32] well i'm going to have to go now i don't
[1:29:34] mean to offend no one i don't mean it
[1:29:35] that way but that's why god never
[1:29:37] allowed isn't allowing this message to
[1:29:39] have a mecca because god doesn't want us
[1:29:41] thinking i'm going to get the holy ghost
[1:29:43] when i go to this building walk up here
[1:29:45] and kneel at this altar in this place at
[1:29:47] this time
[1:29:49] god gives the holy ghost when sons and
[1:29:51] daughters of god submit themselves amen
[1:29:55] and meet the criteria as it were repent
[1:29:58] be baptized and cry out for the holy
[1:30:01] ghost step into the presence of god
[1:30:04] now we believe god is all present amen
[1:30:07] and so it's not that it has to happen
[1:30:10] even in a church isn't that amazing
[1:30:13] as much as we believe in going to the
[1:30:14] house of god sitting in the house of god
[1:30:17] joining together to worship the lord you
[1:30:19] don't have to be in a church to receive
[1:30:21] the holy ghost isn't that beautiful
[1:30:24] amen i know of men that were clinging
[1:30:26] it's a lovely story actually a man went
[1:30:28] on to do wonderful things for the lord
[1:30:30] this was back in i think the 1860s or
[1:30:33] 70s and and uh quite a rough and vile
[1:30:36] man and he worked on a a whaler ship you
[1:30:40] know they they harvested whales if i
[1:30:42] don't say it right whaling whaling ship
[1:30:45] and their ship is sinking
[1:30:47] now he's clinging
[1:30:49] to a piece of wood in the middle of the
[1:30:51] ocean he knows that they are way out
[1:30:53] there up almost to sister beth's house
[1:30:56] and uh way out there
[1:31:00] and now he's clinging to a piece of wood
[1:31:02] what is left
[1:31:06] and he's thinking on his life
[1:31:09] and amazing what god would do to go back
[1:31:11] and make us rewind our life
[1:31:13] well wait my life was painful i don't
[1:31:15] want to rewind it god will make you
[1:31:17] rewind it
[1:31:18] because you can't have
[1:31:21] a whole bunch of static
[1:31:23] in your life i'm just going to use the
[1:31:25] word static because otherwise i'd be
[1:31:26] here the rest of the day describing all
[1:31:28] the various influences
[1:31:30] you can't have a lot of static in your
[1:31:32] life that has brought you to a place
[1:31:34] today
[1:31:35] you can't serve god freely
[1:31:38] are you with me
[1:31:40] so what will god do as much as you don't
[1:31:42] like it and i don't like it god's going
[1:31:44] to force you to rewind your life and go
[1:31:47] back to the static and deal with it and
[1:31:50] when you have dealt with that static and
[1:31:51] you got it out of your life then it is
[1:31:53] my brother and sister many people now
[1:31:55] i'm going to talk in psychology here but
[1:31:57] many people my brother and sister had
[1:31:59] things that have happened in their youth
[1:32:01] or whatever stage of their life that has
[1:32:04] left them with so much static they
[1:32:06] cannot trust god
[1:32:09] they want to trust him did you catch
[1:32:12] that they want to
[1:32:14] but they can't
[1:32:17] so god just starts forcing them
[1:32:20] to rewind the reel
[1:32:23] and you say but i've been a a christian
[1:32:25] my whole life no you've got to get back
[1:32:27] to the point the prophet of god said
[1:32:28] wherever you left him at
[1:32:31] come on
[1:32:32] and you say this isn't real deep
[1:32:33] spiritual stuff no you're right it's not
[1:32:36] real deep amen but you've got to be
[1:32:38] washed by the water of the word entirely
[1:32:42] not just certain portions of life but
[1:32:44] entirely you know the word has got to
[1:32:46] take you back to that place and somebody
[1:32:48] betrayed you somebody done you wrong
[1:32:51] something happened and a bitterness and
[1:32:53] a fear and anger rose up in there but
[1:32:56] you just glossed it over and you went on
[1:33:03] and now you can't trust the lord
[1:33:05] and you don't know why
[1:33:06] you cry out in prayers lord lord lord
[1:33:09] but yet we pull back
[1:33:12] the lord wants to open the whole wide
[1:33:14] world to you
[1:33:15] and we pull back
[1:33:18] and say i don't know why i don't know
[1:33:19] why
[1:33:20] trust me i prayed with these people
[1:33:23] i prayed with these people my brother
[1:33:24] and sister
[1:33:26] i don't mean to just make points but i
[1:33:28] remember a time south america
[1:33:31] amen had no idea what was happening
[1:33:36] but we were there were preaching in a
[1:33:38] church
[1:33:39] and just something come upon me and i
[1:33:41] used uh what i thought was such a silly
[1:33:43] analogy
[1:33:44] and in the church there i of course had
[1:33:47] a microphone on and i walked all the way
[1:33:49] to the back of the church
[1:33:51] and i'm preaching away and a thought to
[1:33:53] them and i'm preaching away and i'm
[1:33:55] preaching away and then i said now if
[1:33:57] you are going to see paul
[1:34:01] you're going to have to turn and look
[1:34:04] for him
[1:34:08] because the direction you're looking
[1:34:09] right now you won't see him
[1:34:13] my brother and sister no matter what the
[1:34:15] devil has thrown at you and no matter
[1:34:17] what's happening in your life you have
[1:34:19] to stop quit looking at the circumstance
[1:34:22] quit looking at those things that pain
[1:34:24] you and start looking for christ
[1:34:26] amen there's where our deliverance is it
[1:34:29] might not ever come from the person that
[1:34:31] hurts you it might not ever come from
[1:34:33] the church that hurt you it might not
[1:34:35] ever come from a family member that
[1:34:36] hurts you but if you look to christ he
[1:34:39] can come in there and wash that away and
[1:34:42] make that as it were and then the tape
[1:34:44] can replay and you come to the place you
[1:34:46] say my god is an awesome god i can trust
[1:34:50] my god he is looking out for me he will
[1:34:53] never forsake me
[1:34:55] but if that don't happen my brother and
[1:34:57] sister we wonder why we go forward in
[1:34:59] life and we can't fully trust the lord
[1:35:02] oh hallelujah
[1:35:04] look at these
[1:35:07] disciples the witnesses of an upper room
[1:35:09] experience and god took them all over
[1:35:11] the earth and you can look at the
[1:35:12] disciples the apostles and see how they
[1:35:15] died they died in india they died in
[1:35:17] turkey they died you know in rome and
[1:35:19] they died all over my brother and sister
[1:35:21] every one of them without exception paid
[1:35:24] with their life
[1:35:25] now if god would require that of them
[1:35:28] he'll require the same of you
[1:35:30] ours might not be
[1:35:32] crucified on a cross upside down
[1:35:36] it might not be us thrown in boiling oil
[1:35:40] amen
[1:35:42] but we'll give our life
[1:35:45] now the word tells us saints that
[1:35:47] we can't truly say that jesus is the
[1:35:49] christ without the holy ghost is that
[1:35:51] right
[1:35:52] amen now what is the difference there
[1:35:54] the difference of one's voice speaking
[1:35:56] it in one spirit speaking it that's
[1:35:58] right right anybody you see you know
[1:36:01] anyone can say jesus is the christ
[1:36:04] that's just good plain english or
[1:36:05] whatever language you're speaking but
[1:36:07] you know it's when it comes from the
[1:36:09] spirit that it changes that holy spirit
[1:36:12] moving us what is we we were sharing the
[1:36:14] other day ownership amen lord is
[1:36:16] ownership amen got to come to the place
[1:36:19] you say yep i don't even belong to
[1:36:21] myself i don't even belong to my family
[1:36:23] i belong to him amen amen that's right
[1:36:31] how much more the power of the word is
[1:36:32] released by the holy spirit
[1:36:34] you see my brother and sister that's why
[1:36:36] people can have the same bible same
[1:36:38] message book that you have and get an
[1:36:40] entirely different uh conclusion from it
[1:36:43] is because we go one from the flesh or
[1:36:45] from the spirit and when the spirit
[1:36:47] comes down the word said that the
[1:36:50] word of god is so sharp it will separate
[1:36:52] the morrow and the bone amen is so sharp
[1:36:55] that it can come and separate our
[1:36:58] reasoning
[1:36:59] from the word
[1:37:02] you say but we need to understand that's
[1:37:03] right understanding is not reasoning
[1:37:06] and yet the critics would come and say
[1:37:09] did they not say let us reason together
[1:37:14] the holy ghost
[1:37:16] talking to the unconverted
[1:37:18] just open your mind for a moment
[1:37:21] and look how awesome our god is
[1:37:24] look how supernatural our god is look
[1:37:26] how these scriptures have been fulfilled
[1:37:30] but satan comes in such a fashion that
[1:37:32] he makes reasoning a perfectly
[1:37:35] reasonable
[1:37:36] thing
[1:37:38] yeah isn't that amazing hope you all
[1:37:40] don't mind i haven't drank
[1:37:42] water at the pulpit
[1:37:44] forever and last couple weeks here
[1:37:47] breaking that
[1:37:53] let's look here in hebrews 7 and 14. i
[1:37:55] need to hustle right along
[1:37:59] now we
[1:38:00] see
[1:38:02] as
[1:38:03] the sanhedrin the pharisees sadducees
[1:38:06] sanhedrin while they are judging things
[1:38:09] it doesn't take a very deep review of
[1:38:11] history to show that they are simply
[1:38:14] riddled with tradition
[1:38:16] and you know lest you guys that feel
[1:38:18] real comfortable the message is actually
[1:38:20] getting riddled full of tradition
[1:38:22] and so that spirit the prophet of god
[1:38:25] says you know the devil takes his man
[1:38:27] but he never takes his spirit god takes
[1:38:29] his man but he never takes his spirit so
[1:38:31] these spirits are still here where
[1:38:32] people are saying we as message
[1:38:34] believers do this like this
[1:38:37] and if you break that
[1:38:40] now if you want to see how funny
[1:38:42] tradition can be
[1:38:44] you go to an event in an
[1:38:47] lds or mormon church
[1:38:49] and wear a colored
[1:38:57] the shirt just walked in our church
[1:39:01] how do you know that
[1:39:03] they've got a blue shirt on they've got
[1:39:05] a red shirt on
[1:39:07] and we
[1:39:11] only wear white shirts
[1:39:12] to church
[1:39:15] i can take you right to a church in the
[1:39:16] message that holds that same thing i
[1:39:17] don't know if they had a mormon
[1:39:19] background or not
[1:39:21] amen if you had a brother walk up in the
[1:39:22] pulpit with a colored shirt on the
[1:39:24] deacon should drag him and throw him out
[1:39:25] the side exit where he couldn't be seen
[1:39:27] from the street
[1:39:30] tradition
[1:39:34] but white represents purity
[1:39:38] said every catholic priest
[1:39:46] for it is evident that our lord sprang
[1:39:48] out of judah of which tribe moses spake
[1:39:52] nothing
[1:39:53] concerning
[1:39:54] the priesthood
[1:39:59] oh
[1:40:00] it's in the line of david
[1:40:04] the priests don't come
[1:40:07] from there
[1:40:09] priests come
[1:40:11] from my family and your family
[1:40:13] and that family
[1:40:15] and they gave me one anybody else last
[1:40:17] year in the church so their family
[1:40:20] come on come on
[1:40:24] speak nothing concerning priesthood and
[1:40:26] yet it is far more evident for that
[1:40:28] after the similitude of melchizedek
[1:40:30] there arises another priest
[1:40:32] see god said you know what man's gonna
[1:40:35] so mess this thing up that i'm gonna
[1:40:37] already provide an avenue that falls in
[1:40:39] the priesthood but it ain't gonna fall
[1:40:41] in a carnal element because satan's
[1:40:43] already just study the history of
[1:40:45] caiaphas
[1:40:48] man they had a dynasty
[1:40:53] and it struck me
[1:40:55] i probably shouldn't even say this in
[1:40:56] public but it struck me i thought oh
[1:40:59] that's how
[1:41:00] some ministries
[1:41:02] end up being worth millions
[1:41:05] they pick up a bible a harley can
[1:41:07] stutter their way through their first
[1:41:08] sermon and 30 years later they're worth
[1:41:11] millions of dollars
[1:41:13] they've got a spirit
[1:41:16] atheist
[1:41:21] so
[1:41:21] who is made
[1:41:23] not after the law of carnal commandment
[1:41:28] see here's the problem we have sometimes
[1:41:30] my brother and sister we have stepped so
[1:41:32] far away from the word of god deluded it
[1:41:34] so down that we start to this is how we
[1:41:36] do this this is how we do this we don't
[1:41:39] do this we don't do that you know i find
[1:41:41] it interesting now i'm not mean to
[1:41:43] negative because just that's that's the
[1:41:44] way things are had a brother one time
[1:41:47] come did communion with us here in the
[1:41:49] church and afterwards he made a comment
[1:41:51] to me caught me so off guard he goes boy
[1:41:53] you guys do communion weird
[1:41:56] well um
[1:42:00] it's the way i was raised it's the way
[1:42:01] we've always done it well that's what
[1:42:03] i'm talking about you guys don't do it
[1:42:05] right
[1:42:06] and i'm like okay how should we do it
[1:42:09] well you should you should take the wine
[1:42:12] and the bread to the people
[1:42:15] you have scripture for that
[1:42:18] no but that's how brother soul and so
[1:42:20] does it
[1:42:22] oh okay well how about you go back and
[1:42:24] tell them that brother so and so does it
[1:42:26] this way and they ought to change
[1:42:29] you know that joke kind of went out
[1:42:33] because we have our our tradition we
[1:42:35] have our way
[1:42:38] but you see
[1:42:40] melchizedek this priesthood that we've
[1:42:43] been called to
[1:42:45] was not after the law of a carnal
[1:42:47] commandment
[1:42:48] but after the power of an endless life
[1:42:52] my brother and sister if the communion
[1:42:54] is taken to the church
[1:42:56] i just took communion sister jerry just
[1:42:58] took communion uh i think
[1:43:01] i guess we did take alia with us she was
[1:43:03] there you know
[1:43:05] you go they bring it out they pass it to
[1:43:07] you in the in the in the aisle
[1:43:09] i didn't say well this ain't communion
[1:43:11] it's ain't the way we do it
[1:43:13] it was communion
[1:43:17] what are you laughing about
[1:43:22] oh we went and got it and then drank it
[1:43:23] in our seats okay well you know i am
[1:43:26] slightly over 60.
[1:43:28] that's my excuse
[1:43:31] i'ma stick with it
[1:43:32] okay we did walk up there that's right
[1:43:34] but we drank it and ate it sitting in
[1:43:36] the in the congregation
[1:43:39] i knew i knew when i uh
[1:43:41] anyway shut up paul
[1:43:45] but you see what what's happening none
[1:43:46] of this oh let me make my point i'm
[1:43:48] trying to make here none of this my
[1:43:50] brother and sister whether it's a white
[1:43:51] horse or a white cloud the prophet of
[1:43:53] god said you just need to believe he's
[1:43:55] coming whether it's communion in the
[1:43:57] seat communion up front communion this
[1:43:59] way or whatever that way my brother and
[1:44:01] sister as long as we're in communion
[1:44:03] with jesus christ there's the issue
[1:44:08] there's the issue
[1:44:10] amen because the power of an endless
[1:44:12] life is what god intended this is what
[1:44:15] started in the upper room by brother and
[1:44:17] sister it was not a one-time pentecostal
[1:44:20] event now i'm going to skip over a few
[1:44:22] things so i'm going to throw this out we
[1:44:23] got another thing moving in the realms
[1:44:25] of the message and they'll look over and
[1:44:27] say you know what those people are just
[1:44:29] acting way too pentecostal to be message
[1:44:31] believers well my brother and sister
[1:44:33] look where the true root come from it
[1:44:34] didn't come as it were in a street and a
[1:44:38] church or a place like that it come in
[1:44:41] the upper room and they walked out
[1:44:43] spilled out in the street and quietly
[1:44:46] tiptoed off
[1:44:49] no sir there were some people that were
[1:44:50] alive they were talking in other tongues
[1:44:52] they were praising god and people around
[1:44:55] this message are then looking at that
[1:44:57] and saying you know what why can't they
[1:44:59] be message baptists
[1:45:03] or because we have our own methods
[1:45:07] message methodists
[1:45:10] you know that's what stands for
[1:45:12] they don't have some deep deep spiritual
[1:45:14] connotation it was we have a better
[1:45:16] method
[1:45:23] you guys that are ocd would know what
[1:45:25] i'm talking about
[1:45:27] you have a method nobody can put the
[1:45:28] dishes away like you do nobody can put
[1:45:30] the silverware away like you do nobody
[1:45:32] can arrange the house like you do
[1:45:34] oh
[1:45:35] somebody move the picture on the piano
[1:45:36] how do you know well when i stand right
[1:45:39] over here inside off of the flower stand
[1:45:41] it's got to be exactly between here and
[1:45:42] the corner of the picture frame
[1:45:45] because i read that in betty crocker
[1:45:50] yeah i said that on purpose
[1:45:53] but what happened
[1:45:55] this power of an endless life makes you
[1:45:58] and i priest to almighty god amen for a
[1:46:02] season no my brother and sister not just
[1:46:06] for a season but an endless life
[1:46:09] an endless life and it testified that
[1:46:11] we're after the order of melchizedek was
[1:46:15] that
[1:46:16] just
[1:46:17] a seasonal thing
[1:46:21] no sir
[1:46:23] no sir
[1:46:24] abraham knew who he was looking at
[1:46:27] abraham didn't say well i'm so glad god
[1:46:29] sent a priest my way abraham looked and
[1:46:32] said this
[1:46:33] is god amen himself
[1:46:37] in flesh
[1:46:40] now look my brother and sister this is
[1:46:41] where it gets complicated as long as
[1:46:43] we're able to look back in history and
[1:46:45] say well that was god in flesh jesus
[1:46:47] christ was god in flesh we see a prophet
[1:46:49] of god that god moved so closely that
[1:46:52] people thought he was god in flesh and
[1:46:54] we cannot bring ourselves to look in the
[1:46:56] mirror and believe that we are god in
[1:46:58] flesh for nothing
[1:47:00] you can't convince me i'm god in flesh
[1:47:03] i've heard those words and it breaks my
[1:47:05] heart because regardless of what you
[1:47:08] might see is weakness in me and what i
[1:47:10] see is weakness in me god looked down
[1:47:13] and said that's my son and that's where
[1:47:16] i'm going to pour myself and that's
[1:47:18] who's going to go forth on the earth in
[1:47:20] the 21st century and testify that i'm
[1:47:24] alive
[1:47:26] we can look back in history and say rose
[1:47:28] from the grave but is he living today
[1:47:32] oh hallelujah
[1:47:34] amen now
[1:47:36] are the priests forever after the order
[1:47:38] of melchizedek that's eternal life right
[1:47:40] there my brother and sister there is
[1:47:42] verily a disannuling of the commandment
[1:47:45] going before for the weakness and
[1:47:47] unprofitableness thereof for the law
[1:47:49] made nothing perfect but the bringing in
[1:47:52] of a better hope did
[1:47:54] by which we draw nigh
[1:47:57] unto god
[1:47:59] god said you know what
[1:48:01] i'm not going to give you as a believer
[1:48:02] this argument over law and grace you
[1:48:06] realize that's what's going on out here
[1:48:07] in the denominational churches as they
[1:48:09] get farther and farther away from god
[1:48:13] their their their their place they go
[1:48:16] back i can't remember the word i just
[1:48:17] wanted you but the place they go their
[1:48:19] anchor post their anchor post they're
[1:48:21] getting farther and farther from it but
[1:48:23] you know what their deal is when you
[1:48:24] talk to them
[1:48:25] oh well you're under law we're under
[1:48:27] grace
[1:48:32] okay
[1:48:33] deacons turn the lights down
[1:48:43] they get up there and
[1:48:44] do their thing it's no more worship
[1:48:47] than anything
[1:48:50] but they tell you
[1:48:52] if you had a revelation of living under
[1:48:54] grace
[1:48:56] yeah
[1:48:59] got a whole nother side street we won't
[1:49:00] go there it took me too long to get here
[1:49:03] for the law made nothing perfect but the
[1:49:05] bringing in a better hope did by which
[1:49:07] we draw nigh amen unto god
[1:49:10] now in the five
[1:49:11] definite identifications of the true
[1:49:13] church
[1:49:15] i want you to catch this real quick i'm
[1:49:17] going to hurry through this
[1:49:18] now you can graft citrus fruit you can
[1:49:21] take an orange tree and put a lemon on
[1:49:23] it and it'll grow
[1:49:24] that's what you men grafted in now
[1:49:27] brother brown's talking in spiritual
[1:49:28] context here saying
[1:49:30] he's saying that's what you man grafted
[1:49:31] in and these organization is what man
[1:49:34] grafted in it's a lemon
[1:49:37] isn't that funny because what do we
[1:49:39] refer to my brother and sister when
[1:49:40] something's a failure
[1:49:43] it's a lemon
[1:49:45] now i don't know if god just ordained
[1:49:47] you know anointed brother branham to use
[1:49:49] that as an example because why didn't he
[1:49:50] choose grapefruit
[1:49:52] but you see in a world we live in
[1:49:55] forever and ever history showed that
[1:49:56] when we thought something was a failure
[1:49:58] it's a lemon
[1:50:02] it's a lemon
[1:50:03] all the time
[1:50:04] it'll grow because it's stuck out in the
[1:50:07] church name but let me tell you if that
[1:50:10] tree ever puts forth another branch
[1:50:12] itself it'll bear an orange and if the
[1:50:15] power of god ever puts forth another
[1:50:17] church
[1:50:18] uh oh
[1:50:20] uh oh
[1:50:22] it took us years to get our church tamed
[1:50:25] down
[1:50:26] to fall under that anointing amen
[1:50:32] dying calf
[1:50:34] come on we're not called to come in the
[1:50:35] house of god to be dying calves you say
[1:50:37] well none of us pronounce it that way
[1:50:39] but some do in their spirit
[1:50:41] i know it's expected of me to say amen
[1:50:43] to that quote but i don't like it
[1:50:49] can i repeat that just a i got a i got a
[1:50:52] rash on you now i want to bring a little
[1:50:54] blood blood's cleansing
[1:50:57] some of you
[1:50:58] don't like these quotes that you hear
[1:51:05] but we're expected to say amen
[1:51:13] now if we can only say that jesus is the
[1:51:14] christ and the holy ghost
[1:51:17] can i step out you guys just don't know
[1:51:18] how strong this limb is i'm going to
[1:51:20] walk away out on this limb
[1:51:22] did you know my brother and sister if we
[1:51:25] can only say that jesus is the christ
[1:51:27] by the holy ghost
[1:51:30] then an amen
[1:51:32] is not an amen unless it's anointed in
[1:51:35] the spirit
[1:51:37] it don't matter how many amens we speak
[1:51:40] if there is no acceptance no anointing
[1:51:44] no revival attached then that is just as
[1:51:47] empty as you would be like a marine
[1:51:49] corps and say hurrah
[1:51:51] now imagine how shocked you go as it all
[1:51:53] be if somebody's come and sit in church
[1:51:55] and 30 times in a service hurrah
[1:51:58] and be like what's wrong with this guy
[1:52:01] that'd be just as empty
[1:52:03] as an amen that didn't come from here
[1:52:04] amen
[1:52:06] boy god help us
[1:52:08] god help us
[1:52:10] if god ever puts forth another church
[1:52:12] it'll be another pentecost
[1:52:15] they didn't
[1:52:16] tiptoe out of the upper room saints i'm
[1:52:19] not talking about how you got to be wild
[1:52:21] and jump up and down and shout and do
[1:52:22] all these things i'm talking about the
[1:52:24] fact that there's a spirit trying to
[1:52:26] subdue your spirit to keep you humbled
[1:52:29] down not humbled in the right way but
[1:52:31] beat down to where you can't really say
[1:52:34] from the heart amen to the word of god
[1:52:37] you see god hears the amends that the
[1:52:38] preacher never hears
[1:52:40] yeah
[1:52:42] yeah the one that comes from your heart
[1:52:44] amen it'll be another pentecost another
[1:52:47] book of acts will be wrote behind it
[1:52:49] that's right now it's very interesting
[1:52:51] when you talk about the book of acts you
[1:52:52] look through the quotes i encourage you
[1:52:54] to go look them up you'll see there my
[1:52:56] brother and sister some people push back
[1:52:58] on this because they think that we're
[1:53:00] trying to impersonate
[1:53:02] that early church
[1:53:05] and they're right
[1:53:10] they're right
[1:53:13] because
[1:53:15] the prophet of god in some of his
[1:53:17] closing ministry
[1:53:20] said you need to go back
[1:53:22] to the original
[1:53:23] word
[1:53:25] now we're not trying to impersonate them
[1:53:27] to find history and dress like them and
[1:53:30] grow our hair out and do this and do
[1:53:32] that but you're going to find that
[1:53:34] original church was liberated by the
[1:53:36] holy ghost
[1:53:38] satan did not have them chained down he
[1:53:41] did not have them bound down in their
[1:53:43] mind or their spirit but look
[1:53:45] history will show you
[1:53:47] many of them
[1:53:49] were hungry
[1:53:50] and destitute
[1:53:52] and everything that goes with that day
[1:53:55] but they had liberty
[1:53:57] in jesus christ
[1:53:59] they had liberty in the word
[1:54:02] oh if i could just pay all my bills
[1:54:04] without worry i'd be i'd have liberty no
[1:54:06] you just buy more stuff that you'd have
[1:54:08] to worry about
[1:54:13] another book of acts will be wrote
[1:54:14] behind it that's right because it's the
[1:54:16] church of god jesus said i am the vine
[1:54:19] you are the branches you cannot bear
[1:54:22] fruit in yourself but i throw my own
[1:54:25] self
[1:54:26] into the branch
[1:54:28] i like i like how we put that just good
[1:54:30] old kentucky english i throw myself in
[1:54:32] there hallelujah well you know the
[1:54:34] moment was there god finally got us to
[1:54:36] open up and he just threw himself right
[1:54:38] in here because my brother and sister we
[1:54:41] know
[1:54:42] that in our self there is no good thing
[1:54:45] how could i ever come how could you ever
[1:54:47] come to the place that we'd say i'd be
[1:54:49] worthy to receive the holy ghost
[1:54:52] impossible
[1:54:53] but god come and just put himself in
[1:54:55] there
[1:54:56] and then all of a sudden we found
[1:54:57] ourselves
[1:54:58] oh lord throw these magazines away throw
[1:55:00] these books away throw the television
[1:55:02] out uh start oh these clothes got to go
[1:55:05] got to do this got to do that
[1:55:08] you want to go to the lake with my
[1:55:09] family and swim
[1:55:11] no the prophet said mixed bathing's not
[1:55:13] correct
[1:55:14] so we're not going to do that
[1:55:16] well that's legalist
[1:55:20] strange my prophet
[1:55:22] that god sent to me
[1:55:25] was a legalist i guess
[1:55:28] see how the devil's so slippery
[1:55:30] oh your standard's a little different
[1:55:32] from ours you're a legalist
[1:55:34] as though that means that you have a
[1:55:36] tail on pitchfork and horns
[1:55:39] no my brother and my sister
[1:55:42] we've got to get the mind of god amen
[1:55:44] what god said now i'm not trying to be a
[1:55:46] legalist many of you you have to decide
[1:55:48] what you're going to do for yourself
[1:55:51] but the thing is you see
[1:55:53] he said i'm the vine you're the branches
[1:55:55] you can't bear fruit in yourself so we
[1:55:57] can't even oh we don't even have an idea
[1:56:00] of our own
[1:56:01] we should not even have an idea of our
[1:56:03] own lord what should i do about this
[1:56:05] look at the word lord what do i need to
[1:56:07] do about this what about a job what
[1:56:08] about this what about a house what about
[1:56:10] a car what about all this stuff what
[1:56:11] about the clothes we buy what what is it
[1:56:15] amen reminds me i think it was brother
[1:56:16] donnie reagan
[1:56:18] said this years ago
[1:56:19] he says some of you got this idea
[1:56:21] you can go down to mcdonald's three
[1:56:23] meals a day
[1:56:25] and pray pray the cholesterol and the
[1:56:27] calories right out of that stuff
[1:56:31] and then you come
[1:56:33] after years of horrible eating
[1:56:37] and say
[1:56:38] i've got heart disease of a kidney
[1:56:40] disease i've got this i've got that
[1:56:44] pray for me brother donnie
[1:56:47] that the lord would deliver me
[1:56:55] oh he can deliver you you believe that
[1:56:57] don't you
[1:56:59] but he might start with your diet
[1:57:02] as my wife says amen really loud
[1:57:07] but you see there's there's merit to
[1:57:09] this
[1:57:10] lord help me
[1:57:14] but i throw myself in the branch what
[1:57:15] kind of fruit did i it bear these signs
[1:57:18] shall follow them that believe now i'm
[1:57:19] going to close here i've still got too
[1:57:21] much more but i just want to remind some
[1:57:23] of you
[1:57:25] maybe you saw this
[1:57:26] maybe you haven't
[1:57:29] but
[1:57:30] quite a few years ago
[1:57:32] brother danny steeman was preaching down
[1:57:33] in louisiana
[1:57:35] at the camp
[1:57:37] he wanted to make a point
[1:57:38] about signs and wonders
[1:57:40] you know that's making another run
[1:57:42] through the message
[1:57:43] people are like well i just you know
[1:57:45] this just isn't producing what i thought
[1:57:47] it would and uh we don't see signs and
[1:57:50] wonders we're not seeing miracles we're
[1:57:51] not seeing you know tongues spoken or
[1:57:54] we're not seeing these things and we're
[1:57:55] starting to question this we don't know
[1:57:57] is something wrong well i like how
[1:57:58] brother danny stevens put it he chose a
[1:58:01] couple of young boys from the church and
[1:58:02] i almost was going to be brave enough to
[1:58:04] choose some children but brother brother
[1:58:06] danny he's he's a preacher in a way
[1:58:07] there and he says the problem with you
[1:58:09] guys is you are there you're thinking
[1:58:11] that signs and wonders is what proves
[1:58:13] the word of god proves the message but
[1:58:15] he said that's not it that's a
[1:58:17] promise from god himself
[1:58:19] that's not a promise from william
[1:58:20] branham that's not a promise from
[1:58:22] whoever is the pastor of this church
[1:58:24] that is a promise from god himself and
[1:58:26] the problem is is that we start going
[1:58:29] and we're moving through life here and
[1:58:31] we keep looking back to see if we have
[1:58:32] some signs and wonders but i liked how
[1:58:34] brother danny said it he spoke to these
[1:58:36] boys you can hear him he says now you
[1:58:38] know brothers you follow me no matter
[1:58:40] where i go or what i do you follow me
[1:58:42] and so this two young brothers are like
[1:58:45] yes sir
[1:58:46] and brother danny he's there and uh and
[1:58:48] he's at the at the camp and he goes down
[1:58:50] through the congregation and these two
[1:58:52] boys are following and he's preaching
[1:58:54] while he's going you see and now he says
[1:58:56] you know it's by faith and and do i need
[1:58:59] to stop and say now by faith look back
[1:59:01] and see if signs and wonders are
[1:59:02] following no god said they would
[1:59:05] i don't have to confirm it that's god's
[1:59:08] job to confirm it and brother danny then
[1:59:10] wandered through the whole church and
[1:59:12] these two young boys just following
[1:59:13] right behind him he says you see the
[1:59:16] signs and wonders would follow them that
[1:59:19] believe and he does not say if you stop
[1:59:22] and check it out
[1:59:24] it doesn't say if it's convenient for
[1:59:26] you he said that the signs and the
[1:59:28] wonders would follow the true believer
[1:59:31] and so my brother and sister we don't
[1:59:33] live for signs and wonders we live for
[1:59:35] jesus christ the signs and the wonders
[1:59:38] become part of our experience they are
[1:59:41] not what defines our experience they are
[1:59:44] not what it is but the devil has come in
[1:59:47] and he's put reasoning in there and we
[1:59:49] say but we're not seeing a great this
[1:59:51] and we're not seeing a great that and so
[1:59:54] i don't know if it's true or not no what
[1:59:56] we're going to do is say the word said
[1:59:58] the word said the word said and the
[2:00:00] quotes that i was going to read to you
[2:00:01] goes by and you'll see jesus christ
[2:00:04] never come my brother and sister he had
[2:00:06] all power
[2:00:08] and all authority
[2:00:10] amen
[2:00:12] even on the cross at the snap as it were
[2:00:14] of a finger
[2:00:20] and he let them crucify him
[2:00:24] why
[2:00:26] because i needed reading
[2:00:29] amen you needed redeemed
[2:00:32] and he caught the picture do we have the
[2:00:34] idea that it was just almost like an act
[2:00:36] and he went through it no big deal no my
[2:00:38] brother and sister when you read
[2:00:41] as i have just read what they did in the
[2:00:43] crucifixion of where they placed
[2:00:47] the spike
[2:00:49] you know why they placed it where they
[2:00:50] placed it
[2:00:52] well one that the word of god would be
[2:00:53] fulfilled
[2:00:54] but they placed it right between those
[2:00:56] two bones
[2:00:58] so
[2:00:58] that when they hung them
[2:01:01] it would be all of the cartilage and all
[2:01:04] the tendons and all the muscle
[2:01:07] would hold the weight
[2:01:09] so it wouldn't tear the hand off many
[2:01:12] depicted that it was there like out by
[2:01:14] his fingers
[2:01:16] no they had this down to a science
[2:01:19] but it also fulfilled scripture that not
[2:01:21] one bone would be broken amen
[2:01:23] and when they were there to say hey we
[2:01:25] got to get this over with we need to do
[2:01:27] this let's break his legs they went up
[2:01:29] there they pierced him with the spear
[2:01:32] and said oh he's already dead
[2:01:35] now my brother and sister if god thought
[2:01:37] it through enough to bring you and i to
[2:01:39] a place that his precious blood could
[2:01:42] redeem us
[2:01:43] oh my goodness i just was reading no
[2:01:46] doubt many of you have recently i don't
[2:01:47] know brother branham walks into that
[2:01:49] little cafe
[2:01:51] sees that young girl and then boys kind
[2:01:53] of loving on her
[2:01:55] looks over here and here's grandma with
[2:01:56] a couple old men loving on him and
[2:01:59] here's a policeman over here
[2:02:01] gambling
[2:02:04] and righteous indignation
[2:02:06] now don't look at me like you've never
[2:02:08] felt this way
[2:02:10] come on saints
[2:02:12] we've looked at people and thought them
[2:02:14] poor sorry sinners
[2:02:17] the prophet of god's thinking that
[2:02:20] and the holy spirit
[2:02:24] he steps off around that corner
[2:02:27] and he sees the world
[2:02:29] and he sees all of that vision coming
[2:02:31] forth
[2:02:33] oh
[2:02:35] that's the sins of the world
[2:02:38] no william branham
[2:02:40] that's your sin
[2:02:42] oh my brother and sister look what god
[2:02:44] has done amen he took the reasoning out
[2:02:47] of the word that you and i could look
[2:02:49] right in the word and say i would be
[2:02:52] lost
[2:02:54] i would be lost without him and the word
[2:02:57] is my redemption and jesus there in that
[2:02:59] time he had all power at the snap of a
[2:03:02] finger at a word all of those things
[2:03:05] would be bound and he would be loosed
[2:03:09] but he had
[2:03:13] he had the power
[2:03:16] within him
[2:03:19] to hold back
[2:03:21] and let the word
[2:03:22] be fulfilled
[2:03:24] you realize that's as much power my
[2:03:26] brother and sister as it would be to
[2:03:28] cast them and bind them and lose himself
[2:03:31] is this as much power for him to stop
[2:03:34] and say i'm not doing this for me
[2:03:38] i'm doing this for paul
[2:03:40] put your name in there i'm doing this
[2:03:42] for them
[2:03:47] even in the garden
[2:03:49] i'm closing sister emmy come that'll
[2:03:51] force me to
[2:03:54] even in the garden
[2:03:55] do you realize the stress and the strain
[2:03:57] that he went through was so much
[2:04:00] that blood they have a medical term for
[2:04:02] that
[2:04:03] blood
[2:04:04] popping out the pores
[2:04:08] not coming from the nose eyes ears mouth
[2:04:11] such tremendous strain
[2:04:15] blood popping out of the pores
[2:04:20] how much blood does it take to forgive
[2:04:21] our sins
[2:04:23] [Music]
[2:04:24] swan drop
[2:04:26] one drop
[2:04:29] one drop saying
[2:04:32] do you realize he was already redeeming
[2:04:34] us
[2:04:35] had already redeemed us
[2:04:38] before he ever made it to the cross
[2:04:41] to be crucified
[2:04:43] and he knew that in his flesh it would
[2:04:45] be easier to walk away
[2:04:48] but he knew that if he did
[2:04:51] you and i
[2:04:52] would be reasoned
[2:04:54] away i'm just paraphrasing some of these
[2:04:56] quotes that i won't get to
[2:04:58] he knew if he didn't do that you and i
[2:05:00] could be reasoned away
[2:05:03] from the word
[2:05:04] in this day
[2:05:06] because he made such an absolute
[2:05:08] statement
[2:05:10] and it had such a prophetic and profound
[2:05:12] effect upon you and i
[2:05:14] will look at that and say
[2:05:17] he loved me
[2:05:18] when i couldn't even love myself
[2:05:20] he loved me when no one loved me
[2:05:23] and i'm gonna love him in return
[2:05:25] you see
[2:05:27] what kind of fruit did it bear

[2:05:31] that it's bury

[2:09:47] place in the bible
[2:09:48] were they baptized in the name of the
[2:09:50] father son holy spirit

[2:10:06] truth
[2:10:08] i want the proof of the word now you say
[2:10:10] now what are you saying paul that we've
[2:10:12] got to prove it to you yes
[2:10:14] i'm saying it's got to be proven to me
[2:10:18] but
[2:10:18] i'm telling you god uses some unique
[2:10:20] ways to prove it to us
[2:10:22] he lets us get sick so he can heal us he
[2:10:26] lets us get discouraged so he can lift
[2:10:28] us up he lets us get broke so he can
[2:10:31] become our provider
[2:10:33] but we don't like none of those things
[2:10:35] we'd like it just to show up it reminds
[2:10:37] me of time brother rich call

[2:10:49] they literally had nothing a little bit
[2:10:51] of milk in a jug
[2:10:52] and not even enough milk or cold cereal
[2:10:54] to feed the children nothing in their
[2:10:56] house
[2:10:59] brother cobb

[2:11:47] know what you need
[2:11:49] and he actually
[2:11:51] sometimes
[2:11:52] just deals in the realm
[2:11:54] of what we would like him to do
[2:11:55] [Music]
[2:11:57] it's not life or death
[2:11:58] [Music]
[2:11:59] not really going to make any difference
